GarrisononHudson N Y KNOW THEN THYSELF LONG ago as history measures time when our planet was regarded as a flat disk girt by an unknown sea and heaven was no farther away than the fair summit of Mount Olympus when learning centered about the eastern curve of the Mediterra nean and a knowledge of music mathe matics and philosophy constituted a liberal education a master mind emphasized the seemingly simple precept Know thyself Centuries later when the disk had rounded into a sphere when Jehovah had superseded Jove when civilization had be come continental when the classics mod ern languages and literature had been added to the list of scholarly pursuits a keen little Englishman echoed the injunc tion of the ancient Greek And today when scientific research has extended beyond the confines of the habit able portion of the earth invaded the depths of the sea explored the uttermost heights of the atmosphere and mapped the heavens when God is worshipped as a spirit and ever more reverently as we begin to comprehend the marvels of his creation when the making of many books has given this knowledge entrance through every door open to receive it how much more reason have we than had Alexander Pope to re  Address of President of American Folklore Society at annual meeting Chicago January 1 1902N S VOL XV No 380 echo the advice of the sage of old  Know thyself Man may boast that he has conquered a universe but what does he know about his own nature He began to study it but a little more than a generation ago when the publication of the Origin of Species and the confirmation of the conclusions of Boucher de Perthes rendered possible the organization of the science of man Instead of a few individual writers and an occasional investigator there is now a welltrained corps of anthropologists Act ive national societies have been formed costly laboratories are maintained and ex cellent journals are published The science is taught in the leading universities of most civilized countries in the United States some degree of instruction in it is offered in thirty colleges It has seemed to me worth while to set forth my reasons for believing that anthropology should be taught in every college in America both because of the information it imparts and the discipline it gives As a branch of education anthropology has passed the pioneer period In some of our older institutions where instruction in it has been given for more than ten years the number of instructors and students is continuously increasing Always offered as an elective anthropology has thus dem onstrated its ability to win its way As an objection to the introduction of this new science it is sometimes said that college curricula are already crowded But with the rapidly extending elective system the number of courses offered far exceeds the time limit of any individual At Har vard for example the undergraduate might study one hundred years before obtaining his bachelors degree if he took all the courses open to him I presume that the authorities of our universities of a hundred and fifty years ago would have considered their curricula threatened by an appalling congestion if to the subjects of that time had been added simply the increase of courses due to the present status of knowledge in those branches And yet besides all these additional de partmentselectricity biology psychology have been admitted not only enriching the schedule of studies but winning promi nent rank therein Similarly anthropol ogy the crown and completion of the sciences is assuming its rightful place and I shall endeavor to show why it may be added with special advantage to even a crowded curriculum Since anthropology has become clearly defined we hear fewer protests that it em braces too much Its very comprehensive ness is a virtue for thereby it is rendered suitable to serve as a framework for all other knowledge whatsoever a symmetrical framework lacking which the student but too often builds a series of mental water tight compartments so to say that give no unity or harmony to the intellectual edifice Mathematics for example though a dis cipline study based upon necessary reason ing and thus perhaps the most remote from anthropology nevertheless finds its appro priate place in this ideal educational struc ture The anthropologic student learns that among some peoples the mastery of the number concept does not extend beyond the ability to count two or three that all grades of mathematical comprehension ex ist from this primitive condition up to our own denary system He learns that cul ture may be most profoundly influenced by the reaction of the number concept upon human thought The basic number may determine the number of gods that are se lected to rule through the calendar it in fluences agriculture and indeed most of the industrial arts it affects the pleasures and religious ceremonies of the people Wherefore I maintain that the addition of the human touch to mathematics gives SCIENCE 562SCIENCE new meaning to the limited portion of the science with which the average student is acquainted In the case of geology the relation to anthropology is more obvious With the general outlines of geology the earth build ing processes the sequence of strata and the like the student is familiar before he takes up the study of anthropology Pass ing over the rapidly increasing importance of the economic uses of geologic materials from mine and quarry we observe that the later geologic periods are of supreme inter est in the discussion of the great problems of the time and place of mans origin Back to the confines of the tertiary we have traced the remains of man and his handiwork and beyond that barrier we are constantly hoping to pass Therefore at each new archeologic discovery the question of geologic age must be answered After these primal problems come those of the distribution of mankind during the glacial and other cosmic changes At other points in geology the human relation is likewise established and without it the allied sci ences geography and meteorology would be poor indeed Permit me to cite one more example drawn not from the sciences but from be liefs During his course in anthropology the student receives instruction in the so called science of religion studying it wholly as a product of human thought or imagination It is a revelation to him to discover the vital part religion has played in the history of the human race He learns that religion dictates to millions of his fellow creatures what they shall eat and drink what they shall wear how they shall work and how they shall play what they shall think about and some things about which they may not even think Says Brinton of the savage From birth to death but especially during adult years his daily actions are governed by ceremo nial laws of the severest often the most irksome and painful character He has no independent action or code of conduct and is a very slave to the conditions which such laws create Not only among sav ages does this intimate connection between religion and all other elements of culture manifest itself but also in all other grades of development in all times and places He must have breadth of view who realizes the significance of it The theological stu dent however liberal views but one side the art student sees little more than the influence of religion upon painting or architecture or music the sociologist deals primarily with Caucasian culture the an thropologist alone investigates religion im partially in relation to other phases of thought Furthermore the erection of this frame work brings before the attention of the student the rooms that are incomplete and vacant so that he may set about furnishing them With this guidance he will study modern geography with its complete sur vey of environment and life comparative religion with its breadth of view the fine arts as the highest expression of universal feeling history which he will approach with a correct sense of proportions and time relations For he will see that the adoption of the first articulate word by man as dis tinguished from the mere animal cry of his ancestors was an event of infinitely greater importance than the foundation of the Roman Empire that the discovery of the art of kindling fire was vastly more sig nificant in history than the battle of Tours Modern anthropology does not formu late theories from travelers tales nor in dulge in metaphysical speculations It proceeds to its conclusions by the scientific method of direct observation and experi ment a method that is obtaining so much popularity that most students desire some acquaintance with it By proper training APRIL 11 1902 563N S VOL XV No 380 in any of the natural sciences this knowl edge may be acquired but it frequently happens that students having no taste for these branches will not take them under the elective system Thus they may be graduated with an excellent store of lin guistic literary or mathematical informa tion and yet be sadly deficient in the power of observation and of correct inference important requisites for success in this workaday world To such students anthro pology opens a new field He who may abhor the smell of zoological specimens and the sight of laboratory dissections will per haps take kindly to the examination of fictile objects or textiles or the various other art products that we study to deter mine the cultural status of this or that group of men or for the purpose of tra cing the course of industrial or aesthetic development He who may be indifferent to the wonders revealed by the lens of the botanist may engage with enthusiasm in research relating to the music mythology or ceremonies of alien peoples He whose interest is not held by the marvelous story of geology fixed in lifeless stone may be zealous in the study of living humanity Among his fellows the anthropologist finds abundant opportunity for cultivating his powers of observation After studying the problems of heredity miscegenation degeneracy and the like it becomes an in stinct with him to note the color of hair and eyes the shape of the head and face and other individual peculiarities of those around him A friend tells me that he relieves the tedium of a long examination of which he may have charge by tabulat ing statistics concerning the busy writers before him how many are lefthanded part their hair in the middle wear glasses are blonds or brunettes and the like Here it is little more than a pastime but it illus trates the manner in which the habit of observation is fixed In the field the anthropologic investi gator quickly discovers that to record accu rately requires the keenest watchfulness Let us suppose that we are witnessing the annual festival of the Jicarilla Apaches The event is the relay race The runners are marching in column through the surg ing mass of spectators Drums are beat ing rifles and revolvers are fired shouts and cries add to the confusion What is the signal that causes the column to divide Why do all march to one goal and then half of them march back to the other Soon the crack of the starters pistol sends the best runner of each of the two groups down the course on the first relay The excitement is intense The walls of the narrow lane down which the brown forms are flitting yield to the pressure from without and threaten to collapse The ob server struggles to obtain a position near the goal Does the winner touch his suc cessor of the next relay Does he hand him any object to carry  What is the pur pose of these branches of cottonwood that are moved up and down the line What is the meaning of the tufts of down that are added to the scant attire of the run ners Why are they cooled by spraying their backs from the mouths of their at tendants What are the methods of im parting speed resorted to by the opposing factions For half an hour the observer hurries from point to point with camera and pencil in hand and then suddenly the uproar becomes deafening The race is ended Offerings of bread grapes and other fruits from the distant Rio Grande even watermelonsare thrown from the crowd to the victors A dozen observers are needed now to complete the account Indeed some measure of ubiquity is often longed for by the fieldworker He has every incentive to become proficient in quickness and accuracy of observation Again the student may be so fortunate 564 SCIENCEAPRIL 11 1902 as to witness a Maricopa medicine dance The shaman is in doubt as to the nature of the disease he must consult the dead for guidance in treatment of it Followed by his awe stricken friends he approaches a grave but not too closely and calls to the resident spirit Out of the darkness of the night come ghostly whispers in reply The medicine man grows more confident and emphatic his followers shrink farther back To them the dialogue is conclusive evidence of the power of the shaman To the observer it presents an opportunity for the detection of fraud Is he clever enough to discover the identity of the confederate  Can he see without seeming to do so   The naturequickened keenness of obser vation of those whom the field investigator studies affords him an example wherefrom he must needs profit In no other science is the object of research at once an example and also laboratory material Again and again I have been impressed by the degree of perfection in observation manifested by Indian hunters in all parts of America Old Peter the Assiniboine for example with whom I hunted big horn in British Columbia taught me as much about ob serving as any college professor ever did Of course I appreciated the fact that his livelihood depended upon the cultivation of this trait and it was not surprising that he should manifest proficiency in that one line when practically all others were ex cluded Peter led the way into the moun tains through passes yet choked with the late snows of winter riding an old cayuse whose speed was not in the least accel erated by the tattoo of Peters heels on its ribs A band of green mosquito netting kept Peters hatrim against his ears on cold days and served to protect his eyes on bright ones But my attention was soon drawn from his attire to the skill with which he read the half obliterated signs I could see the tracks as well as he but I could not follow a single one through a maze as complicated apparently as the crowded street through which the dog trails his master with unerring swiftness Contrast with Peters keenness the lack of it exhibited by the Gila freighter who had made a dozen trips to Tempe and yet wagered his team that the butte that over looks the town was on the left as one ap proaches the place There are no hills to confuse ones memory within twenty miles along that road so that he had no excuse to offer no word to say when he found the butte on his right as he entered Tempe He simply left the team and wagon to his more observing companion and walked home Incidentally field research enables the student to travel and thus add to his re sources for happiness throughout life For it is not alone the viewing of new scenes and new peoples that gives him pleasure but there is the more lasting enjoyment re sulting from the addition of new territory to his literary domain For example it is well known that he who visits the realm of arctic frost is ever tempted to return He also finds the keenest pleasure in reading of the experiences of others in that region of infinite vastness After the lapse of ten years I feel as deep an interest in that Land of Desolation and Death as when I left it Again those who know the great arid Southwest find in its tragic history and in the writings of its pioneer anthro pologists a source of perennial pleasure He who has felt the spell of the desert has added a priceless treasure to his experi ence He can sympathize with the belief of the desert dwellers that the wraithlike remolinos sending their columns of sand toward the bluest of heavens are not minia ture whirlwinds but spirits of air that the pillars and other strangely eroded forms of sandstone are the figures of men trans fixed there in the early twilight of time he SCIENCE 565N S VOL XV No 380 himself has felt the clutch of the demon of thirst that camps ever close upon the trail The student engaged in field research in archeology can usually find but few facts at best from which to reconstruct the history of the past and those few are often ob scurely hidden in the mud of the swamp or the sand of the desert where a careless blow of the spade may annihilate the rec ord forever For example the shape of ancient wooden implements may be known from the mold of clay in which they de cayed but this form may be destroyed by a single stroke Many old skulls also are so fragile when found that after a few minutes exposure to the air they crumble to dust Careful treatment may save some of them but quick and accurate observa tion is absolutely necessary But correct observation is not the sole requirement for success It suffices to render a man useful and helpful in minor positions but ere he can become a leader in thought and action he must have the ability to interpret the data accumulated In other words he must develop his rea soning powers and here again anthropol ogy presents her opportunity In the do main of culture history particularly in its genesis he ventures upon so much con troversial ground that he must wield his weapons well in order to pass safely through It was to this opportunity for diversity of opinion and the innate belli cose tendency of man that Huxley attrib uted the growing popularity of the science a quarter of a century ago I have found that the presentation in the lecture room of the interjectional gesture and other theories of language usually leads to the liveliest discussion with the students dis cussions that are sometimes adjourned to the home of the instructor The ascertain able evidence relating to the origin of be liefs gives rise to widely differing induc tions A venerable friend who is prepar ing a treatise upon religion told me that he had found sixtytwo theories accounting for its originand I had the pleasure of calling his attention to a sixtythird In the examination of any considerable por tion of that array of arguments the stu dent must exercise his judgment to dis criminate between the plausible and the reasonable He aims to discover funda mental principles and laws and to that end his attitude must be not credulous but critical Folklore too has its debatable problems of myth migration acculturation and relationship In the arts opportuni ties for independent reasoning abound for example the student may examine the weapons utensils and ceremonial objects of a tribe and by comparison and analysis determine the character and course of de velopment of its decorative art He may study primitive scales of music and inves tigate the theories of Darwin Spencer Grosse and others accounting for its ori gin The ethnologic study of technology is by no means the least in its power to stimulate thought Thecollege student all too fre quently loses sight of the importance of the part that manual labor plays in the main tenance of civilization and is usually ig norant of the extent of its contributions to cultural development It extends the range of his thoughts to learn of the age long gropings of his forebears in their dis covery of the value of a newly fractured flint as a cutting instrument and their im provement of it until it became a symmet rical blade He sees a deeper meaning in the simpler industrial activities as he learns that the training of the muscles reacts upon the brain The savage who binds a raw hide netting around a rough frame for his snowshoes finds that the untrimmed edges of the wood soon cut through the leather He makes many pairs perhaps before he 566 SCIENCESCIENCE notices that when he scrapes the surface of the wood the lashing wears longer He derives a sensation of pleasure also from the contact of his hand with the smoothed surface and this gradually develops a mental pleasure at the sight of wellmade frames His skill in cutting and carving increases with practice so that decoration of implements and weapons becomes pos sible or as we say the manual concepts react upon the aesthetic mental concepts When the student of anthropologic habit of thought contemplates that wonderful product of this industrial age the ocean liner he takes it by and large His men tal vision sees beyond it the long line of less and less ambitious craft that terminate with the floating log propelled by a pole or with the naked hands Yet more than this he sees migratory movements prob ably initiated by the food quest that re quired the use of boats to cross now a river now an arm of the sea He sees a resulting development of commercial routes forming a vast network which even in the earliest historic times was the product of centuries of growth and the interplay of forces ultimately environmental The vista is a long one and in viewing the evolution of this single industry the student per ceives something of the complexity and grandeur of the laws that have moulded the modern arts And so because based upon broad lines and yet balanced by ex haustive special researches the science of anthropology develops a sane and whole some mind The inherited proclivity of the Anglo Saxon to despise all nonCaucasians be comes in the anthropologist a passion for studying them He knows that his self assumed superiority has its limitations that his own ancestors in times geologically recent were tattooed cannibals as primi tive in habit as the Digger Indians of the Sierras He knows that his culture is in 567 a measure due to environment to the chance that led those early immigrants to a continent whose vast extent of shore line rendered it immeasurably superior to all others as the home of commerce His people were surrounded by animals capa ble of domestication while the American race for example was handicapped by their absence Not only does the anthropologist take a more modest view of the virtues of the Caucasian but he also learns to credit the savage and barbarian with many praise worthy qualities He finds that our aborig ines are more devout than we their happy family life most exemplary their patience and courage under the wrongs of border civilization most admirable This knowl edge induces forebearance and respect Brought into contact with these and other alien races through field research the an thropologic student discovers that they can estimate his worth with surprising quick ness they may not have heard of the nebu lar hypothesis they may be unacquainted with the units of the metric system but they can take the measure of a man with a glance Anthropology with ever widening knowledge of the peoples of earth promises to make real that dream of the poets the brotherhood of man not a relationship based upon sickly sentimentality but a brotherhood resulting from an understand ing of the capacities and limitations of our fellow beings We shall then have ap preciation without adulation toleration not marred by irresponsible indifference nor by an undue sense of superiority Anthropol ogy leads to a more charitable attitude toward the diverse philosophies of men dealing as it does with the basic motives of all systems It induces religious tolera tion which says our greatest of college presidents is the best fruit of the last four centuries And yet although the sun APRIL 11 1902N S VOL XV No 380 of enlightenment has absorbed the flood of mediaeval religious persecution we have all seen remnants noisome pools of intoler ance in localities where the cleansing rays seldom and feebly penetrate I know of no instrument with a potency equal to that of anthropology for their removal The proverbial tendency in the college student toward selfcomplacency is checked and corrected by a knowledge of the broad lines of cultural development of the primal principles of all human activi ties Vanity cannot thrive in the contem plation of a plan that requires an eternity for its fulfilment Wisdom is before him that hath understanding The somatologist discovers in the human body a record kept by the vital principle of heredity of its upward struggle from the simplest animal forms This living his tory dates from a past beside which the glacial epoch is but as yesterday yet it is not vague and indecipherable it is boldly written Pages are inscribed in our mus cles others in vein artery and gland in the digestive system and the epithelial tracts and others in that most conserva tive of tissuesthe nervous system In head trunk and limbs these functionless fossilized structures abound not only useless to us now but positively dangerous as they frequently become the seat of dis ease In like manner the folklorist finds in the body politic survivals of belief and practice that antedate and supplement written history Backward they lead through ever simpler social organizations to the primitive period when men walked in the fear of gods innumerable that influ enced every waking moment and filled with dread their dreams Yet farther and the investigations of the folklorist mingle with those of the comparative psychologist along the border line between brute and lowest human These survivals also are a men ace to individual welfare as I doubt not that more than one person will be executed for witchcraft within the boundaries of these United States in this year of grace 1902 It is not long since a Pima Indian was killed by his fellow villagers in Ari zona because he knew how to use a car penters spiritlevel With the magic stick he had begun pushing at unheardof speed the preliminary survey for an irrigating ditch That night a jury of his peers tried convicted and shot this Piman martyr to progress Not only the individual but the tribe or community also may be injured by the con tinuance of traditions from a lower cultural stage The power of tradition is an ac cepted aphorism An illustration of the power and possibilities of evil in such a survival is seen in the case of the city of Mexico Six centuries ago a migrating band of aborigines was led by a myth to select an islet in a stagnant lake as the site of their pueblo a choice that it is extremely improbable they would otherwise have made But the eagle with the serpent in his talons alighted on a cactus there and thus determined the location of Tenoch titlan The village became a city and throve in material prosperity but it suf fered one serious disadvantage it was sub ject to submergence under the waters of the lake so that protection was sought in a great causeway seven or eight miles in length Later a drainage canal was begun as the centuries passed millions on millions were spent in the work thousands and hun dreds of thousands of peons perished in that ditch In the mean time the city of Mexico suffered the odious distinction of having the highest death rate of any capi tal in the world Not alone in its origin but also in its downfall as the seat of Aztec power did this city illustrate the effect upon the com munity of traditional belief In the golden 568 SCIENCESCIENCE age of the empire the fair Quetzalcoatl taught the useful arts and of the lands of Anahuac he formed a paradise Cotton had not then to be cultivated but grew wild ready colored the hue of every dye The maize plant was of such a size that a single ear was a carriers load Melons oertopped their owners heads Not the favored class alone but all men possessed palaces of silver and gold But the adver sary came in the form of an old man who roused in Quetzalcoatl a desire to wander to other lands With his departure the fruittrees withered and the singing birds took flight Then arose the belief that he would return and it was the expectation of his second coming that unnerved the fierce courage of the Aztec warriors before the palefaced Cortez Was he the white god of their fathers Credulity doubt and dissension hastened their undoing For more than a millennium England has been a Christian nation yet in the museum at Oxford we see images bris tling with rusty nails and needles which demonstrate the late survival of a belief in sympathetic magic in the rural commu nities whence these objects came Within the university itself I secured a desiccated specimen of a familiar vegetable which an officer of one of the colleges had carried for years as a preventive of rheumatism Neither centuries of enlightenment nor the revolutionary changes of this progressive age have exterminated such beliefs They even adapt themselves to the new condi tions as in the case of the lady living with in the shadow of the walls of Harvard University who maintains that carbons from arc lamps are a sure preventive of neuralgia I am aware that the study of these be liefs sheds light upon the history of the mental development of the race and is of the highest value in certain theoretic con siderations but I involuntarily think of 569 folklore as a study that will influence practically the life of him who engages in it He learns that much that he has ac cepted from childhood without thought as truth is mere superstition and error Not until he has had his attention called to the existence of these survivals does he realize their abundance or the part they play in the daily lives of those around him They are by no means confined to the servants quarters they are also in his own family to whatever class or country he may belong The nature and the prevalence of error are literally brought home to him We all admire truth and natural lawin the ab stractand seek the widest possible knowl edge of them by means of a most admira ble educational system And yet the graduate seldom possesses the power of applying theoretical knowledge to his own individual life This is not an argument for what is termed a practical education but an explanation of a condition which I believe can be greatly improved by thor ough training in anthropology By the comparison of customs and be liefs it was discovered several years ago that striking similarities exist whenever like environmental conditions prevail It was the discovery of this principle of unity that led anthropologists to seek among the savages and barbarians of today an expla nation of survivals in the Caucasian group Hundreds of examples of these Ethno graphic Parallels have been observed One will serve our purpose here In savagery the functions of priest and physician are combined in the medicineman He fits himself for his profession by a rigorous training and has the utmost faith in his own power to enlist the sympathy of the beneficent gods and to expel the evil ones Disease he banishes with a formula of magic words or with ceremonies that are oftentimes elaborate Upon analysis it is found that the success of the shaman de APRIL 11 1902N S VOL XV No 380 pends upon two elements the credulity of man and the power of the subconscious mind The parallel is observed in the medicinemen of that modern cult which numbers hundreds of thousands of other wise intelligent Americans Their healers proceed by methods no more rational than those of the aborigines and in some re spects similar to them Their success de pends upon the same two factors The red shaman calls the headache an evil demon and proceeds to suck it through a tube The white shaman terms it sin and dispels it by a demonstration The student of folklore learns of the rise and fall of many an occult belief As this phase of human experience is intangi ble and variable those only who have been instructed concerning the characteristics of thought can profit by an accumulated knowledge While anthropology may not be classed as a bread and butter study it does equip the student who is to become a mer chant physician attorney with a practi cal knowledge of the motives of his com petitors and clients He learns in youth the significance of the folksaying Human nature is the same the world over His interest in the science cannot terminate with the passmark of the final college ex amination but must be coextensive with his interest in his kind He will employ it in his vocation and enjoy it as an avoca tion To the aspirant for honors in the diplo matic service anthropology offers an ad mirable training He learns the signifi cance of the racial factor in national wel fare the measure and condition of pro gress the principles of ethnologic juris prudence and also the characteristics of the particular people among whom his du ties lead him For the legislator anthropology must become a necessary preparation America has problems whose solution calls for the widest knowledge of races and cultures Such knowledge free from political bias and hereditary prejudice can best be gained by the study of the science of man The list of these problems is a formidable one including Philippine slavery Moham medan harems Tagal insurrections Span ishAmerican complications coolie labor the negro problem the Indian question not to mention the demands for legislation that shall regulate the immigration of Poles Russian Jews Italians Hungarians and others Anthropology prepares the lawmaker and the jurist for the task of coping with crime Criminal anthropology has ex plained the character and causes of crim inality and degeneracy and led to revolu tionary changes in the methods of crime prevention While it is difficult to accept all the claims of the school of which Lom broso is the accomplished master we must acknowledge our indebtedness to it for the reforms that it has directly or indirectly inaugurated For the injurious effects of exclusive specialization anthropology offers a cor rective It is particularly fatal to narrow ness in the teacher who oftentimes leads young people to specialize in his particular field before they are aware of their own aptitudes and wishes It forearms the teacher of inferior races who usually ig nores the traditional mental activities of those he would instruct It induces a more considerate attitude in the missionary who calls the religion of his parishioners mere superstition and speaks with contempt of their mode of thought not appreciating the manner of its growth through un counted centuries of struggle These few representative examples but suggest the extent of the utility of the sci ence in the affairs of men In the training of youth anthropology furnishes a com 570 SCIENCEAPftIL 11 1902 prehensive outline of human knowledge showing the relations existing among its several branches and giving the student a correct sense of the proportion between what he knows and what there is to know Employing the scientific method it teaches how to observe College training in it is continued directly in subsequent experience with the world The material is ever at hand Dealing with the vital problems of all epochs it inculcates breadth of mind and develops the reason It induces con sideration and awakens appreciation of other men and other races It supplies an available touchstone of truth and error Wherefore it is that a new and deeper meaning now abides in the words Know then thyself presume not God to scan The proper study of mankind is man FRANK RUSSELL AMERICAN MORPHOLOGICAL SOCIETY II Notes on Cyanea Arctica CHAS W HAR GITT The early cleavage phases are passed while the eggs are still within the gonads or in the complicated folds of the manu brium A gastrula is formed following total cleavage by invagination and an early closure of the blastopore ensues The embryo becomes ciliated before its escape from the egg membrane within which it may be seen slowly rotating On emer gence it is almost spherical but soon as sumes the ovoid shape characteristic of the Coelenterate planula While details as to the formation of the entoderm are not yet complete they seem in the main to confirm the observations of Hyde Smith and the recent work of Hein The encystment noted by Hyde and Mc Murrich has been common in the specimens under consideration though I have been able to show that the process is rather in cidental than essential as claimed by Mc Murrich It seems wholly conditioned upon the environment where favorable and natural the process is rare or absent The scyphistoma stage of development was attained in variable periods depending again upon conditions Under favorable conditions it may occur in from eight to ten days while under other conditions it may not take place within as many weeks Thus also with the changes involved in strobilization and the release of the ephyrae Under favorable circumstances they have taken place in the aquarium within a period of eighteen days from the escape of the planula to that of the ephyra Stolonization occurs as in Aurelia but much less freely as does also the origin of buds from the stolons Budding fromn the side of the polyp was not observed in Cyanea its small size probably rendering such process difficult The entire life history from the egg to the free ephyra was followed in

HIGH SCHOOL CLEVELAND OHIO SINCE THE DISCUSSION OF THE RED SCHOOLHOUSE AND ITS EVOLUTION INTO THE GREAT PUBLICSCHOOL SYSTEM OF TODAY PAGES UPON PAGES HAVE BEEN WRITTEN IN DISCUSSING A WIDER USE OF THE SCHOOL PLANT MUCH HAS BEEN SAID FOR AND AGAINST THE ACADEMIC SCHOOL THE COSMOPOLITAN SCHOOL THE HIGH SCHOOL OF COMMERCE AND THE TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL HOWEVER LITTLE HAS BEEN SAID OF THE MOTIVE PART OF EDUCATION OR OF THE INSTITUTIONAL SIDE OF THE GREAT MODERN SCHOOL IN THE LARGER CITIES THE SCHOOL PLANTS COSTING HUNDREDS OF THOU SANDS OF DOLLARS FOR GROUNDS BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT MUST BE HELD TO STRICT ACCOUNT FOR DEFINITE RETURNS FROM SO LARGE AN OUTLAY OF MONEY THE QUESTIONS WHAT CAN THE HIGH SCHOOL DO FOR THE BOY AND WHAT CAN THE HIGH SCHOOL DO FOR THE GIRL MEAN FAR MORE THAN MATERIAL PREPARATION FAR MORE THAN ACADEMIC OR TRADE EDUCATION DURING THE ALLOTTED HOURS OF THE SCHOOL DAY SUCH INSTITUTIONS OUGHT TO BE OPEN DAY AND NIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR THEY SHOULD OFFER NOT ONLY PREPARATION FOR LIFES WORK FROM THE FINANCIAL SIDE BUT MUST GIVE TRAINING WHICH PRODUCES HELPFUL CITIZENS AND A HEALTHY COMMUNITY IN THE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO FIND A MOTIVE FOR EDUCATION MOTIVE IS A LARGE FACTOR IN DISCIPLINE IN SCHOOLS OF THIS TYPE THE VOCATIONAL SCHOOL IS EASIER TO DISCIPLINE THAN IS AN ACADEMIC SCHOOL BECAUSE THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY OF THE CHILD ABSORBS MUCH OF HIS SURPLUS PHYSICAL ENERGY TO THE PHYSICAL ACTIVITY IN A MANUALTRAINING SCHOOL ADD THE MOTIVE IN A TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND YOU HAVE IDEAL CONDITIONS SO FAR AS THE TEACHER IS CONCERNED AL THOUGH THE PUPIL DOES NOT USUALLY SPECIALIZE WHEN HE ENTERS SUCH A SCHOOL HE HAS IN MOST CASES DETERMINED SOMEWHAT DEFINITELY HIS CAREER BEFORE HE IS HALF THROUGH HIS FIRST YEAR YET THE PROBLEM OF ADMINISTRATION IS A MORE DIFFICULT ONE THE MODERN SCHOOL TO PRODUCE MAXIMUM RETURNS TO THE TAXPAYER MUST 475THE SCHOOL REVIEW BE AN INSTITUTIONAL HIGH SCHOOL THE INSTITUTIONAL HIGH SCHOOL MUST NOT ONLY BE WHAT IS NOW THE FUNCTION OF THE BEST TECHNICAL SCHOOLS BUT MUST ADD TO THIS MORE OF THE SOCIAL AND CIVIC CENTER WORK PER HAPS DEFINITE OUTLINES OF WHAT IS DONE IN A PARTICULAR SCHOOL MAY BE OF GREATER INTEREST THAN GENERAL DEFINITIONS THE WEST TECHNICAL HIGH SCHOOL OF CLEVELAND ATTEMPTS TO SHAPE ITS DAY COURSES SO THAT THE PUPIL HAS AS GREAT AN EARNING POWER AS POSSIBLE WHENEVER HE STOPS SCHOOL THE CONTACT WITH THE PUPIL AND HIS HOME IS AS CLOSE AS CAN WELL BE EACH MAN TEACHER IS ASSIGNED 30 BOYS FROM ONE NEIGHBORHOOD THESE BOYS ARE HIS SO LONG AS THEY ARE IN SCHOOL THE TEACHER VISITS EACH HOME MAKES FRIENDS WITH THE PARENTS LEARNS THE BOYS SURROUNDINGS AND TENDENCIES AND THERE FORE ADMINISTERS KNOWINGLY NOT BLINDLY EACH PUPIL AT THE PLANT WORKS UNDER THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITIONS OF ADMINISTRATION WHETHER IT BE IN HIS 5 HOURS OF BOOK WORK 15 HOURS OF SHOP OR 3 HOURS OF PHYSICAL WORK A WEEK HE WORKS UNDER NO RULES HE IS A CITIZEN AND HAS THE FREEDOM AS WELL AS THE RESTRICTIONS

STAND BUT ONE THOUSAND WORKING HOURS A YEAR AND LIVE  IN SCHOOLS OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TYPE THE TEACHER MUST FORGET THAT CLASS INSTRUC TION CONSTITUTES HIS DAYS WORK THAT IS ONLY ONEHALF HIS RESPONSI BILITY SUCH SCHOOLS MEAN CONSECRATION TO SCHOOL WORK LONG HOURS DEVOTED TO THE PUPILS GOOD OFTTIMES REPEATED VISITS TO A HOME A LONG DAY THE INCREASED DUTIES ARE COMPENSATED BY BIG EDUCATIONAL RETURNS

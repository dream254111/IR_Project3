High School Cleveland Ohio Since the discussion of the red schoolhouse and its evolution into the great publicschool system of today pages upon pages have been written in discussing a wider use of the school plant Much has been said for and against the academic school the cosmopolitan school the high school of commerce and the technical high school However little has been said of the motive part of education or of the institutional side of the great modern school In the larger cities the school plants costing hundreds of thou sands of dollars for grounds buildings and equipment must be held to strict account for definite returns from so large an outlay of money The questions What can the high school do for the boy and What can the high school do for the girl mean far more than material preparation far more than academic or trade education during the allotted hours of the school day Such institutions ought to be open day and night for the entire year They should offer not only preparation for lifes work from the financial side but must give training which produces helpful citizens and a healthy community In the technical schools it is not difficult to find a motive for education Motive is a large factor in discipline in schools of this type The vocational school is easier to discipline than is an academic school because the physical activity of the child absorbs much of his surplus physical energy To the physical activity in a manualtraining school add the motive in a technical school and you have ideal conditions so far as the teacher is concerned Al though the pupil does not usually specialize when he enters such a school he has in most cases determined somewhat definitely his career before he is half through his first year Yet the problem of administration is a more difficult one The modern school to produce maximum returns to the taxpayer must 475THE SCHOOL REVIEW be an institutional high school The institutional high school must not only be what is now the function of the best technical schools but must add to this more of the social and civic center work Per haps definite outlines of what is done in a particular school may be of greater interest than general definitions The West Technical High School of Cleveland attempts to shape its day courses so that the pupil has as great an earning power as possible whenever he stops school The contact with the pupil and his home is as close as can well be Each man teacher is assigned 30 boys from one neighborhood These boys are his so long as they are in school The teacher visits each home makes friends with the parents learns the boys surroundings and tendencies and there fore administers knowingly not blindly Each pupil at the plant works under the best possible conditions of administration whether it be in his 5 hours of book work 15 hours of shop or 3 hours of physical work a week He works under no rules He is a citizen and has the freedom as well as the restrictions of a citizen He has privileges of which his father never dreamed He has a 6acre athletic field where he may play He has at his command tennis courts basketball courts an outdoor studyhall an outdoor gym nasium indoor gymnasiums showerrooms a library a music room a domestic science restaurant Nor does his less fortunate brother who works in the daytime have much to regret in these advantages Instruction in this school goes on continuously from eightthirty in the morning until nine at night The boy or girl man or woman may come from work directly to the school Here he may keep his clean clothes a locker and showerbath both are ready for him He may exercise in the gymnasium read in the library get a wholesome supper at cost in the school cafe This cafe is a part of the domestic science department and is run at cost on scientific hygienic principles At present 65 printers apprentices and journeymen are released by their employers earlier than the regular closing time They reach the school at five oclock have an hour of printers art under expert instructors have half an hour in the gymnasium then a shower bath and their supper and are back at work at seven oclock This time in the printshop At eight oclock they leave 476THE INSTITUTIONAL HIGH SCHOOL for home better for the association which they have had at the school and better prepared for the trade which they follow This arrangement is open to all trades and is taken advantage of by hundreds of men and women in Cleveland today The school from threethirty oclock until nine is the workingmans collegea college which brings immediate returns to the individual and to the community Similar schools of the institutional type will do much toward answering the criticism of waste and expense in the public schools The oldtype school ran five hours a day for a time not exceed ing two hundred days What business investment of half to three quarters of a million and with ordinary overhead expense could stand but one thousand working hours a year and live  In schools of the institutional type the teacher must forget that class instruc tion constitutes his days work That is only onehalf his responsi bility Such schools mean consecration to school work long hours devoted to the pupils good ofttimes repeated visits to a home a long day The increased duties are compensated by big educational returns and an increase in salary These schools do not mean that a teacher is free at two three or four oclock five days a week and all day Saturday They mean that a teacher is subject to call twentyfour hours a day seven days a week The teachers average time in the school building is nine hours fourteen minutes daily moreover this does not include the time devoted to visits or homes or to outside preparation for class work To the boy such schools mean better education larger opportunity better apprecia tion of the teacher a clearer understanding of why school is to the parent they mean a knowledge of school purpose and discipline a feeling that the teacher has a personal interest in the individual pupil In short such schools mean that the school and the parent must divide educational responsibility To the community they insure a better citizenship better workmen more earning power improved civic conditions Such schools are possible in every community 477

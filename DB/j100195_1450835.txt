j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450835,Dr Fromers Judaism,i263184,178 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW is as unjust as it is paradoxical The modernity of modern Judaism the motive power that brings it into being consists in that very desire to follow out scientific methods more consistently This necessitates a much more accurate discrimination between facts and explanations and between the fact of an explanation and the validity of thlat explanation than seems to satisfy our critics More over Judaism can scarcely be said to be treated in accordance with the improved methods of reasoning unless due attention is also paid to the facts outside the Torah In the above quotation it is true our Rabbi implies as much Two revelations he says are given us Nature and the Torah One single opposing phenomenon  makes an assumption untenable As a rule however our non modern Rabbis have a knack of dismissing Nature with a compliment and taking no further notice of her The modernity of modern Judaism consists in taking these propositions seriously The most scientific explanations of Nature and History are liable to disturb some of those views which go to the mailng of our religion And the modern Judaism of every age is called into being by the need of readjustment Having given vent to our only grievance we hasten to repeat our high estimate of Dr Hirschs book The essays are all admirable Even Some Literary Trifles is so good that it supplies a telling rejoinder to the authors own protest against people who try to find out the sense of some allusion to things Jewish in every author A WOLF DR FROMERS JUDAISM Das Wesen des Judentums von Dr J FROMER Elias Jakob Berlin Hupeden  Merzyn Verlag I905 Pp I83 THIS monograph is one of a series devoted to Kulturprobleme der Gegenwart Its red covers seem to foreshadow the sensational treatment of the Jewish question in which our authors temporary rancour finds vent The Introduction consists of a brief autobiography in which Dr Fromer tells the now commonplace story of early Ghetto life and subsequent selfemancipation One is reminded of poor Solomon Maimon who emancipated himself from the drawbacks of the Ghetto but unhappily also from much besides Born in Russian Poland our author left home in his twentieth year spent some time in Galicia as a teacher of Hebrew and then studied Semitics and philosophy at a German university where he obtainedCRITICAL NOTICES 179 his Doctor degree In 900o he was appointed librarian of the Jewish library in Berlin but forfeited his appointment in I904 in conse quence of an article which he published in the Zuckunft and which is the basis of the present monograph The mere fact that an autobiography ushers in what purports to be an objective treatment of the subject coupled with the antecedents just mentioned can scarcely be said to augur well for an unbiassed treatment of the Jewish question And on the whole ones suspicions are realized for though the book is full of admissions which the really impartial reader cannot fail to construe in our favour yet they are not unlike the blessings of a certain pagan prophet of old With such pleasant anticipations let us turn to the diagnosis of the Jewish question remembering of course that to trace the cause of Jewish disabilities to the cruelty intolerance or blindness of our oppressors would be nothing novel or sensational The result of the new and original diagnosis of the Jewish question is this Judaism and Judaism alone is the cause of antisemitism With lightning rapidity our author follows up the entire course of Jewish history finds out that Jewish history is all shadows with scarcely any redeeming light Those who believe or make believe in bright patches of philosemitism in Jewish history are either fools or knaves Hatred has always followed the Jews everywhere like their very shadow It must therefore be due to something inherent in them It is due to Judaism which carries hatred with it wherever it goes inasmuch as it teaches an ideal which is different from that of other peoples whose ideal it actually combats The fundamental idea or ideal of Judaism is the supremacy of Ethics and utter antagonism to Aesthetics and Logic except in so far as these may serve some moral purpose Among other peoples on the contrary Aesthetics holds the place of supreme honour They live in the present and enjoy it They do what they please and follow the promptings of their senses If the pursuit of pleasure turns out to be disastrous well then they pay the penalty and perish But they do not want to live for ever either as individuals or as nations They prefer a pleasant if brief moment to a long life full of troubles The difference or rather conflict of ideals causes ceaseless friction between Jews and nonJews and this is further aggravated by the reflection that through our obstinate devotion to the supremacy of the ethical ideal the Jewish people form the only exception to the law of eternal flux in the rise and decline of nations To most people all this even allowing for exaggerations may seem a eulogy of the Jews but our author is a disciple of Schopenhauer and intends the very opposite of flattery N2I80 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The supremacy of the ethical ideal in Judaism is obvious though our neighbours will surely resent the offensive compliment which our author pays them in suggesting that they do not acknowledge the supremacy of the moral ideal But is it true that Judaism combats what our author calls Aesthetics and Logic that is the True and the Beautiful as such Judaism combats the immoral be it never so disguised but that is a very different thing As for the Beautiful are not the Song of Songs and the naturepoems of the Bible monuments of aesthetic appreciation  Dr Fromer disposes of the Song of Songs by a reference to its allegorical interpretation Since when however does the Beautiful cease to be beautiful through association with the True and the Good Observe the striking combination in the Scriptural phrase beauty of holiness The chief evidence which our author brings forward in support of his theory consists of passages in which Scripture denounces idolatry such as the descriptive satire in Isaiah xliv Bias has so blinded our impartial author that he fails to see the very obvious character of all such passages namely that they strivefor the True not against the Beautiful And when he proceeds to show how Judaism has always been opposed to what he calls Logic one begins to suspect him of having rashly judged his coreligionists by his own logic or the want of it The only relevant evidence adduced is that the Bible countenances miracles As though miracles were not characteristic of the early history of science as much as of the early history of religion And he goes from bad to worse when he makes Judaism indifferent even as regards religious truths and mainly concerned with ceremonial He bases his view on a passage which occurs in the introduction to the Midrash on Lamentations but the meaning of which he has obviously failed to grasp The Midrash says 1T nlK 1lN Wnl nW Kr e nlni nKm 1wv nril ni 1in1

sie verlassen und meine Gebote nicht beobachtet Ich wiinschte sie hatten mich aus dem Spiele gelassen und nur meine Gebote beobachtet Could anything be more per verted than this translation Yet our author has no doubt that it means as he goes on explaining it to mean that Jews are not to concern themselves about religious truths not to trouble about God even but simply observe the prescribed ceremonies c Of course all that the Midrash really urges is that even in times of doubt we should still continue to occupy ourselves with the TorahCRITICAL NOTICES I81 that is to study it and our continued occupation with the Torah will eventually reclaim us for God and goodness Our author also cites Moses Mendelssohns remark that Judaism has no dogmas but he does not understand the exact sense in which Mendelssohn used the word dogma The author of Morgenstunden and Phddon was the very last person to be accused of thinking that Judaism is indifferent about say the existence of God and immortality It is not worth while following our author much further His use of choice passages from Rabbinic literature is occasionally such as has already long ago made us regret that the Rabbis had not been warned to talk seriously at the approach of a fool and in his eagerness to show up the ignorance and hypocrisy of German Rabbis he even stoops to make capital out of a friendly jest However having shown to his own satisfaction that the cause of Jewish suffering is to be found in Judaism and nothing else the remedy he suggests is of course for Jews to forsake Judaism and be merged in their Gentile environment Several times indeed he has occasion to point out that there are many born Jews that have abandoned Judaism and suffer from intolerance none the less but he does not seem to observe how this admission affects his theory that Judaism is the exclusive cause of antisemitism And the crowning point of his logic is reached when in the name of Justice he appeals to the Gentile world to promote the absorption of Jewry and so terminate Jewish suffering Why in the name of Justice if Jews alone are to blame for their sufferings  And why in the name of a moral ideal if our devotion to  Ethics  is at the bottom of all the mischief  A WOLF STEINSCHNEIDERS BIBLIOGRAPHY OF JEWISH HISTORY Die Geschichtsliteratur der Juden in Druckwerken und Handschriften zusammengestellt von

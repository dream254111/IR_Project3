j100688,Abstracts of the Papers Printed in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,110046,An Account of Experiments Made with an Invariable Pendulum at New South Wales Abstract,i207044,196 The sixth for the motions of one muscle of the eye The seventh for the voluntary and involuntary motions of the muscles of the face The eighth is the great respiratory nerve The ninth for the voluntary motions of the tongue The nerve sometimes enumerated as the tenth of the brain is pro perly the first spinal nerve like those of the spine it has a distinct double root and is a nerve both of sensation and of motion In the end of the paper certain conclusions are drawn which have reference to the subjects of the preceding papers of the same author And here the author advocates the importance of anatomical inves tigation as superior to experiments on living animals affirming that erroneous opinions in physiology have been sometimes strengthened instead of corrected by such experiments An Account of Experiments made with an Invariable Pendulum at New South Wales by MajorGeneral Sir Thomas Brisbane KCB FRS Communicated by Captain Henry Kater FRS in a Let ter to Sir Humphry Davy Bart PRS Read June 19 1823 Phil Trans 1823 p 308 In this communication laid before the Royal Society at the re quest of Sir Thomas Brisbane Captain Kater gives the results of experiments made by Sir Thomas Brisbane and Mr Dunlop at Pa ramatta in New South Wales and by Sir Thomas Brisbane Cap tain Kater and Mr Rumker in Portland Place London with an invariable pendulum belonging to the Board of Longitude The number of vibrations made by this pendulum in a mean solar day at London in latitude 51 311 81 4 at the temperature of 600 and reduced to a vacuum was found to be 8609017  at Paramatta in latitude 330 48 43 S by Sir Thomas Brisbanes experiments 8602159 and by those of Mr Dunlop 8602221 Captain Kater after detailing these observations proceeds to de duce the compression and finds it by comparing the vibrations at London with those resulting from Sir Thomas Brisbanes experi ments at Paramatta to be rT by Mr Dunlops 25 By the comparison of the vibrations at Unst with those at Para matta Sir Thomas Brisbanes experiments give 3s and those of Mr Dunlop r for the compression But the author remarks that these numbers are not to be deemed conclusive as a small alteration in the number of vibrations made by the pendulum would occasion a considerable difference in the frac tion indicating the compression

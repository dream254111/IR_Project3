ADMIN ISTERING COMMERCIAL FACILITIES In this paper the endeavor will be to collate the legislation of the Federal and of the State Governments on the subject of commercial facilities and to discover if possible the general trend of legislative activity The study of harbors the connecting link between railway and ocean transportation becomes of increasing interest and importance as foreign trade develops Unless harbors are properly constructed and efficiently regulated foreign trade is of necessity heavily handi capped Previous to the adoption of the Constitution the various States regulated their commerce as so many separate nations the Federal Government having a merely nominal suggestive power Not only was there no uniformity in their legislation there was bitter antagonism States endeavoring to enact laws to cripple the commerce of other States In the actual construction and equipment of harbor and wharf facilities individuals were left largely to follow their own whims and desires From such a condition of affairs there has been a steady change first toward more activity on the part of the State Governments and later on the part of the Federal Govern ment The Constitution gives Congress the power to lay and collect taxes duties imposts and excises which shall be uniform throughout the United States to regulate commerce with foreign nations among the several States and with the Indian tribes and likewise places the following restrictions on the States no State shall without the con sent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports and exports except what may be absolutely necessary for the execution of its inspection laws and no State shall without the consent of Congress lay any duty of tonnage But these clauses of the Constitution like many others meant little until interpreted by the Supreme Court and judicial decisions in a series of cases from 1824 to 1884 were necessary to establish an apparent understanding between the Federal and State Governments in the regulation of rivers and harbors 489The Annals of the American Academy Legal Decisions Distinguishing Between Federal and State Authority By the Act of March i9 1787 the Legislature of New York granted to John Fitch the sole and exclusive right of making and using every kind of boat or vessel impelled by steam on all creeks rivers bays and waters within the territory and jurisdiction of the State for a period of fourteen years John Fitch it appears failed to exercise the extensive powers bestowed upon him and by a number of Acts this right was transferred to Robert R Livingstone and Robert Fulton changed only as to the time limit of the monopoly By these Acts the exclusive right was given them to use steam navi gation on all the waters of New York for a term of thirty years from i808 According to the laws of New York any steam vessel without a Livingstone and Fulton license was liable to seizure and forfeiture if found within the waters of the State Opposed to this was a Connecticut law forbidding any vessel with such a license from entering the State and according to a New Jersey law if the representatives of Livingstone and Fulton carried into effect by judicial process the provisions of the New York laws they exposed themselves to a State action in New Jersey for all damages and treble costs This law of the State of New York finally came before the Supreme Court in the year I824 in the famous Gibbons vs Ogden case and the decision was the entering wedge in the separation of State and Federal authority over navigable waterways of the United States Because of its repugnance to that clause of the Constitution giving Congress power to regulate commerce with foreign nations among the several States and with the Indian tribes this law was declared unconstitutional insofar as it prohibited vessels licensed according to the laws of the United States from carrying on the coasting trade and from navigating the waters of the State of New York In other words no State may exclude vessels of the United States from her waters The next phase of the question was brought to light in the State of Maryland In 1821 the Legislature passed a law that all importers of foreign articles or commodities of dry goods wares or merchandise by bale or package or wine rum brandy whisky and other distilled spirituous liquors etc and those persons selling the same by whole sale bale or package hogshead barrel or tierce should before they 9 Wheaton 1 490 60American System of Commercial Facilities were authorized to sell take out a license for which they were to pay 50 In 1827 the Supreme Court2 declared this law unconstitutional being contrary to the clause No State shall without the con sent of Congress lay any imposts or duties on imports and exports and also to the clause Congress shall have power to regulate commerce    That is a tax on importers is a tax on and a regulation of commerce and therefore unconstitutional The matter of registration was the next point to come before the Supreme Courts In 1854 the State of Alabama passed a law requiring the owners of steamboats navigating the waters of the State before a boat should leave the port of Mobile to file a statement in writing in the office of the Probate Judge of Mobile County setting forth first the name of the vessel second the name of the owner or owners third his or their place of residence and fourth the inter est each has in the vessel This law also was declared unconstitu tional insofar as it applied to a vessel which had taken out a license and was duly enrolled under the Act of Congress for carrying on the coasting trade and plied between New Orleans and the cities of Wetumpka and Montgomery in Alabama Special State registration is an unlawful requirement of vessels engaged in coastwise trade The case of Foster vs Davenport differed from the above case in this respect only that the vessel seized for noncompliance was engaged in lightering to and from vessels anchored in the lower bay of Mobile and the wharves of the city and in towing vessels anchored there to and from the city and in some instances towing the same beyond the outer bar of the bay and into the Gulf to a distance of several miles but was duly enrolled and licensed to carry on the coast ing trade while engaged in this business The argument of the Court being that lightering or towing was but a prolongation of the voyage of the vessels assisted to their port of destination The next case5 dealt with the subject of taxation In I866 the State of Alabama passed a revenue law fixing the rate of taxation for property generally at onehalf of one per cent but on all the steam boats vessels or other watercraft plying in the navigable waters of the State the tate was placed at one dollar per ton of the regulated tonnage to be collected if practicable at the port where such vessels 2 Brown vs Maryland 12 Wheaton 419 Sinnot vs Davenport 22 Howard 227 4 22 Howard 244 Cox vs Collector 12 Wallace 204 491 6IThe Annals of the American Academy were registered otherwise at any other port of landing within the state where such vessel might be The vessels in question were enrolled and licensed for carrying on the coastwise trade but as a matter of fact plied only on waters within the State The Supreme Court decided that although taxes levied as on property by a State upon vessels owned by its citizens and based on the valuation of the same are not prohibited by the Constitution yet taxes cannot be imposed on them by a State at so much per ton of the registered tonnage Vessels have long been obliged to pay pilotage whether assisted to and from the harbors by pilots or not and in 1855 the State Legis lature of Louisiana authorized the Master and Wardens of the Port of New Orleans to collect five dollars from every vessel arriving at the port whether called upon to perform any service for the vessel or not But in 1867 theSupremeCourte pronounced the law a regu lation of commerce and unconstitutional since it was a tax levied on all ships It was further stated that the fees of the Master and Wardens differed from that of the pilots in that the pilot laws of the States received Federal confirmation in I789 and also that the pilot laws rest on contract ie payment for actual service The last important case of this series was that of Moran vs New Orleans7 In 1870 the State authorized the city of New Orleans to levy impose and collect a tax upon all persons pursuing any trade profession or calling and to provide for its collection and further added that this law should not be construed to be a tax on property Under the authority of this Act the city established the following license Every member of a firm or company every agent person or corporation owning and running towboats to and from the Gulf of Mexico 500 Cooper was the owner of two steam pro pellers each measuring over ioo tons duly enrolled and licensed at the port of New Orleans under the laws of the United States to be employed in the coasting trade Upon his refusal to pay the license judgment was obtained by the city and sustained by the Supreme Court of the State The Supreme Court of the United States how ever decided that the license was in reality a charge made under the authority of the State for the privilege of employing vessels in the manner authorized by the license of the United States and was there fore a restriction of commerce and unconstitutional  Steamship Co vs Portwardens 6 Wall 31 112 US 69 492 62American System of Commercial Facilities This chronological review of laws and court findings is necessary in order to get some idea of the relation of the Federal and State Governments in the control of vessels plying to and from our ports Vessels may be taxed by the State Governments but such taxation must be based on property value and be collected at port of registra tion And no vessel licensed and enrolled under the laws of the United States for carrying on the coastwise trade may be burdened by any special registration license fee or tonnage tax by any State The Constitution has been interpreted strictly and the States are limited in their taxation of commerce to what may be absolutely necessary for the execution of their inspection laws Governmental Control of Pilots and Pilotage Pilots are largely under State control Prior to I789 most of the States had adopted pilot laws and these laws were early confirmed by Congress8 in these words Until further provision is made by Congress all pilots in bays inlets rivers harbors and ports shall continue to be regulated by the laws of the States wherein such pilots may be or with such laws as the States may respectfully enact for the purpose Friction soon arose between such States as Penn sylvania and Delaware both of which have pilots competing for ser vice to and from ports on the Delaware River giving opportunity to vessels to discriminate between the pilots of the two States This led to a law of the United States requiring the master of any vessel coming into or going out of any port situated upon waters which are the boundary of two States to accept the first qualified pilot who offers his services whether he be licensed in one State or the other The Revised Statutes of the United States No 4237 prohibit any State from making any discrimination in the rate of pilotage or half pilotage between vessels sailing between ports of one State and ves sels sailing between ports of different States Revised Statutes No 4444 make it unlawful for a State or Municipal Government to require pilots of steam vessels to procure State or other license in addition to that issued by the United States or any other regulation which will impede pilots in the exercise of their duties Except for these general regulations the control of pilots and pilotage is left to the State and Municipal Governments Taking Philadelphia 8 Revised Statutes 4235 493 63The Annals of the American Academy for an illustration one of the duties of the Board of Wardens is to license pilots and make rules for their government There are eightyfour pilots half of whom are licensed by the state of Penn sylvania and half by the state of Delaware They serve in turn firstclass pilots taking vessels with draft of eighteen feet and over and the secondclass pilots taking vessels of less than eighteen feet draft The rate of pilotage is fixed by law twelve feet draft and less being I87 per half foot over twelve feet 225 per half foot Pilotage is compulsory a vessel entering the Delaware River must lie beyond breakwater for twentyfour hours if need be waiting for a pilot who when accepted must be paid according to the rate decided upon by the State from which the pilot shall have come In New York harbor the number of pilots is limited to one hundred and thirty They are incorporated take steamers by turn pool their earnings and draw a salary of 200 per month when working full time Pilotage is not compulsory unless a pilot offers his services The rate of pilotage on inward bound vessels drawing twentyone feet draft and upwards is 488 per foot At Baltimore pilotage is compulsory There are fiftyfour pilots licensed yearly by the State The rate of pilotage on vessels of fifteen feet draft and over is 5 per foot Improvement and Control of Waterways In the first part of the paper we endeavored to discover the rela tion between the Federal and State Governments in the general oversight of vessels and cargoes as they come and go in the harbors of the United States Attention will now be directed to the re lation between the Federal and the State Governments in the main tenance improvement and control of waterways9 In a general way it may be said that the Federal Government has authority over the channels of rivers between the wharf lines and that the States have authority over the docks wharves and other conveniences for loading and unloading cargoes This authority is sometimes exercised directly as in the State of Washington where the State has made Constitutional provision for the protection of the 9For a study of the activity of the Federal Government in improving harbors see article by Professor Emory R Johnson Annals of the Academy of Political and Social Science Vol ii page 782811 Professor Albert Bushnell Harts Essays on American Government  Chapter ix 494 64American System of Commercial Facilities water front in other States it is delegated to mtnicipalities and in others individual initiative is largely left unguided and uncontrolled On the other hand individuals corporations and State authorities are not prohibited from improving river channels but are sub jected to the regulation of Congress the Secretary of War and the Chief of Engineers of the Army Prior to the adoption of the Constitution the States exercised their sovereignty improved waterways and levied tolls to meet their expenditures after I789 the lighthouses beacons buoys and public piers were ceded to the United States and the care of them no longer devolved on the State Governments thus removing the principal occasion for the collection of duties However the collection of tonnage duties did not cease immediately and Congress passed frequent enabling acts empowering States to collect duties for needed improvements If a State wished to make some river or harbor improvements she would lay her plans before Congress and if ap proved receive authority to collect by means of taxation of commerce sufficient funds for the completion of the enterprise For example in I8o6 Congress passed an enabling Act to empower the Board of Wardens for the Port of Philadelphia to collect a duty of four cents per ton on all vessels clearing from the port of Philadelphia for any port or place whatsoever to be expended in building piers and other wise improving the navigation of the river Delaware Removal of Obstructions from Channels During the entire first half of the century there appears to have been no clear understanding as to whose duty it was to supervise the waterways of the United States and keep them in suitable con dition to insure safety and rapidity to commerce Even as late as 1859 the Legislature of the State of Pennsylvania passed an Act introduced by the following preamble which plainly indicates the un certainty as to where the duty should rest Whereas frequent obstructions to the safe navigation of the river Delaware and the river Schuylkill within the tidewaters thereof do frequently occur by the sinking of canal boats barges and other vessels and there being no adequate remedy to compel the owner master or other agent having charge thereof to raise and remove the same The Act authorized the Master Warden of the Port of Philadelphia immediately upon information of the sinking of any vessel in the ohannlm of the tide 495 65The Annals of the American Academy waters of the Delaware or Schuylkill within the limits of the port to notify the owner to raise the same within ten days under penalty and upon failure of owner to remove the wreck the Master Warden should do so selling the cargo to meet the expenses In 1864 the Act was amended by authorizing the Master Warden to recover damages from the owner Not until i880 did Congress take action upon this subject10 In that year the Secretary of War was authorized in case of the obstruction of any navigable waterway of the United States river lake harbor or bay to give proper notice to all persons inter ested in the craft or cargo to remove the same and upon their failure to do so the Secretary of War should treat the sunken vessel as abandoned and derelict removing and selling both vessel and cargo and depositing the proceeds in the treasury of the United States to the credit of a fund for the removal of such obstructions This act remained unchanged for two years but in I882 the powers of the Secretary of War were enlarged by authorizing him to sell the vessel and cargo before raising the same In I89o he was further author ized 1 to break up and remove without any liability for damage to the owner any wreck or obstruction that had been allowed to remain more than two months In section six of the same Act Congress forbids the casting from any boat pier or manufacturing establish ment any ballast gravel cinders sawdust or other waste into any of the navigable waters of the United States and where the casting of such material into navigable waterways is necessary for the improve ment of the same a permit from the Secretary of War must be obtained Construction of Bridges Dams and Dykes The Federal Government having assumed the duty of keeping the channels free from obstructions would naturally take the next step of defining more accurately the boundaries of waterways On March 3 I899 Congress in order to further protect the channels of waterways passed an Act regulating the construction of bridges dams and dykes making it unlawful to construct or commence the construction of any bridge dam dyke or causeway over or in any port roadstead haven harbor canal navigable river or other navigable water of the United States until the consent of Congress 10 River and Harbor Act Section 4 River and Harbor Act Sec 8 496 66American System of Commercial Facilities to the building of such structure shall have been obtained and until the plans for the same shall have been submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers of the Army and the Secretary of War However such structures may be built under the authority of the legislature of a State over rivers and other waterways the navigable portions of which lie wholly within the limits of a single State pro vided the location and plans thereof are submitted to and approved by the Chief of Engineers of the Army and the Secretary of War before construction is commenced The only difference in the build ing of a structure over a river wholly within a single State and one which forms the boundary between two States is that in the latter case the consent of Congress must be obtained which is not necessary in the former but in both instances the plans must be approved by the Chief of Engineers of the Army and Secretary of War Plans once approved must not be deviated from in the least either before or after completion of structure without being submitted to and receiving the approval of both the Chief of Engineers and the Secre tary of War Section ten of the same law extended the Federal authority making it unlawful to create any obstruction to the navigable capacity of any waters of the United States unless affirmatively authorized by Congress and also making it unlawful to build or com mence building any wharf pier dolphin boom river breakwater bulkhead jetty or other structure in any port roadstead haven harbor canal navigable river or other water of the United States outside established harbor lines or where no harbor lines have been established without having first received the approval before men tioned Harbor Lines Established by the Secretary of War Section eleven of the same Act authorizes the Secretary of War to establish harbor lines wherever it is made manifest to him that such lines are essential to the preservation and protection of any harbor and beyond these lines no piers wharves or bulkheads or other works may be extended or deposits made except under such regula tions as from time to time may be prescribed by him He is also authorized to require any party who is given the right to build a pier or other structure to excavate if necessary in another part of the harbor sufficient space to compensate for the water displaced by the 497 67The Anals of the American Academy structure Prior to this date wharf lines were located by State or local boards and even yet are usually so located but wherever the Secretary of War has fixed wharf lines the local boards have made their lines correspond Section eighteen of the same Act authorizes the Secretary of War to compel the reconstruction of any bridge railway or other wise wherever in his judgment it is deemed an obstruction of free navigation In giving an order for reconstruction the notice must be accompanied by a plan of the change recommended by the Chief of Engineers of the Army Failure to obey a reconstruction order is a criminal offense and each aditional months delay is a new offense The Secretary of War likewise has the power when the public wel fare requires it to make all needful rules and regulations for the open ing of drawbridges and such rules when so made have the force of law The speed of vessels the navigation of canals the floating of logs and sack rafts all come under his supervision Relation of State Governments to Wharves and Docks The State Governments have exercised their authority over docks wharves and harbor lines in numerous ways and with no attempt at uniformity In some cases the authority is exercised by State Boards with large discretionary power in others by State Boards closely guided by statutory laws and in others still by elec tive municipal boards with appointed heads or by departments under the charge of a commissioner The following table12 gives the forms of wharf and dock owner ship and control in the principal ports of the United States Portland Railroad and Private Bost onl   New York Public   Philadelphia     BaltimorePublic  Norfolk      Newport News     Savannah  Massachusetts State Board on Docks and Terminal Facilities p

Public At San Francisco the docks are public under the control of the Board of State Harbor Commissioners first appointed in 1863 This Board is composed of three persons appointed by the Governor by and with the consent of the Senate for a term of four years They are given possession and control of the waterfront of the city and county of San Francisco with powers to erect structutes within a given line The Board with the Governor and Mayor may estab lish rates for dockage and wharfage collecting from each equal sums of which the total shall not exceed a small designated amount The Board is empowered to locate and construct wharves wherever it deems best and to erect all such improvements as may be neces sary for the safe landing loading unloading and protecting of all classes of merchandise passing in and out of the city and county of San Francisco In the construction of wharves no dock nor slip may be less than 136 feet at the narrowest point between the wharves The Board has control of the mooring and anchoring of vessels in the harbor and keeping the waterways unobstructed and also the authority to extend any of the streets lying along the water front of the city and county to a width of I50 feet the water side of which may be used as a landing place on which tolls are collected The State of Washington incorporated in her Constitution a clause prohibiting the State from selling or relinquishing any water areas beyond highwatermark but such areas shall be forever reserved for landings wharves and streets and other conveniences of navigation and commerce A Harbor Line Commission estab lished harbor lines in the navigable tide water of the State adjacent to cities with a view to providing for docks having a length of 600 feet and avenues fronting thereon of from Ioo to 250 feet in width By this means the water frontage of all the cities in the State is to be preserved in a uniform condition under the control of the State for the purpose of improving the States commerce New Orleans has about thirty miles of water frontage on both sides of the river The wharves and all riparian rights are owned and controlled by the city Leases and licenses have however 499 69The Annals of the American Academy been given frequently to individuals and corporations For many years all wharfage charges were collected by the officers of the city and turned into the city treasury for the maintenance of wharves and other landings but in I891 a lease for a term of ten years was made of five miles of the water frontage the lessees being allowed to collect and retain all charges paid for the use of the property This method of control did not prove satisfactory and the commercial bodies decided that with the keen competition of other ports and the general tendency of business to seek ports which offer the best opportunity for the cheap handling of freight nothing short of free wharfage will relieve the situation In I896 a law4 was passed establishing a Board of Commissioners of the Port of New Orleans with power to regulate the commerce and traffic of the harbor in such a manner as may in their judgment be best for its maintenance and development to administer the public wharves to construct new wharves where necessary to erect sheds thereon to protect merchandise in transit to place and keep the wharves sheds and levees in good condition to maintain sufficient depth of water and to provide for lighting and policing the wharves and sheds to levy charges for defraying expenses in accordance with the sched ule in the Act and to repossess themselves of the frontage farmed out under the ten year lease The Board of Commissioners con sisted of five men resident in the city of New Orleans and ap pointed by the Governor of the State By the laws of Maryland the control of the harbor of Baltimore is vested in the Mayor and the City Councils who have established a Harbor Board consisting of the Mayor and six citizens having control of all matters connected with the harbor and the expenditure of any funds appropriated therefor The State owns two wharves on which are warehouses wherein any citizen of Mary land who raises tobacco may store it indefinitely with no other charges than a payment of two dollars per hogshead on removal of the same At the ends of some of the streets there are a few wharves and an enclosed dock called the city dock all owned and controlled by the city at which boats with garden truck and small steamboats are furnished landings The rest of the ownership is private There are six harbor masters who are appointed in the same manner as other city officers and among their duties is that of the Act of the General Assembly of Louisiana No 70 500 70American System of Commercial Facilities collection of wharfage and dockage rates paying the proceeds to the city register New York The docks and wharves of the City of New York are largely owned by the municipality under a grant in colonial times and are under the control of the Commissioner of Docks Notwithstanding this grant about half the waterfront is claimed as private property From 1870 until 1902 the duty of maintaining and improving the harbor devolved upon the Board of Docks Previous to the organization of the dock department in 1870 there had been no systematic plan of construction of wharves around the city each pier owner building to suit his own fancy or convenience During the period of thirtytwo years in which the control of the har bor was vested in the Board of Docks the total gross revenue from leased wharves increased from 31552454 in I87I to 267333330 in 1902 the revenue from ferry leases and franchises increased from 144640 in 1871 to 30340647 in 1902 and the total annual expenditure audited increased from 486449I2 in 1871 to 2409 37649 in I902 Wharf property valued at I16925797I was acquired by the city and in addition to this a number of piers claimed by private individuals was restored to the city In I890 a board of United States Engineers established a bulk head around the island upon which the department has built several miles of masonry which is to be continued until the island is com pletely surrounded Wharf construction is now systematically planned and carried out under the Commissioner of Docks appointed by the Mayor The wharves are leased for terms of years varying from ten years to those terminable at the pleasure of the Com missioner and at rentals of from 50 to Iooooo per year under one lease Leases may be renewed for periods of ten years but the aggregate number of years cannot exceed fifty The Com missioner of Docks15 has exclusive charge and control subject in certain particulars to the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund of the wharf property belonging to the corporation of the City of New York including wharves piers bulkheads and structures thereon and water adjacent thereto and all slips basins docks waterfronts land under water and structures thereon and has exclusive charge and control of repairing and building rebuilding maintaining 15Laws of New York 1902 vol ii chap 609 5oi 7IThe Annals of the American Academy altering strengthening leasing and protecting the property No wharf pier bulkhead or other structure may be erected without the plans first being approved by the Commissioners of the Sinking Fund and filed with the Commissioner of Docks He also is author ized to regulate the charges for wharfage cranage and lockage of all vessels admitted to the wharves piers bulkheads slips docks and basins constructed under the provisions of the law Boston In I894 a joint commission on improvement of the docks and wharves of the City of Boston found That there is not any public department State or municipal having supervision of the business of the docks and wharves of their capacity size or of the uses made of them The number of wharves in the city at that time was over two hundred all private property used for private purposes and information concerning them rested entirely upon the goodwill of the proprietor Since that time the powers of the Harbor and Land Commission have been enlarged and as stated in the laws of Massachusetts chap 96 sec 7 are the general care and supervision of the harbors and tide waters within the Commonwealth of the flats and lands flowed thereby of the waters and banks of the Connecticut within the Commonwealth and of all structures therein in order to prevent and remove unauthorized encroachments and causes of every kind which may injure the river or interfere with the navigation of such harbors injure their channels or cause a reduction of their tide waters The Board is also authorized to take by purchase or otherwise lands or materials needed for improvements or repairs to recommend harbor lines to the general court which if established by the court become the lines beyond which no pier or other structure may be extended In I897 the Legislature16 authorized the Harbor and Land Commis sioners to construct a pier and dock on the Commonwealth Flats at South Boston at an expenditure not exceeding 400ooo This pier I200 feet long and 400 feet wide creating a surface of wharf area of eleven acres has been built and is the one pier owned by the Commonwealth Philadelphia Contrary to the general rule the port of Phila delphia was more or less carefully organized from its origin By the charter of I70I William Penn constituted the city of Phila 1Chap 513 Acts of Massachusetts 502 72American System of Commercial Facilities delphia to be a port or harbor for the discharging and unloading of merchandise from ships upon so many wharves and quays as the Mayor Aldermen and Common Council of the city should from time to time establish The wharves of Philadelphia were of two kinds public such as the ends of the streets which were for the use of the city and pri vate such as were erected by the owners of the soil In both cases the right of the riparian owner extended only to lowwater mark the privilege of erecting wharves to extend into the stream being one which the Proprietary or his successor the State might grant or withhold In 1763 the Provincial Assembly to encourage commerce and to render approach to these ports more secure passed an Act providing for a lighthouse at the entrance of the bay and the placing of buoys in the bay and river In 1773 provision was made for the appointment of wardens for the port of Philadelphia and for the regulation of pilots plying in the river and bay and the price of pilotage The wardens were to choose one of their number president examine pilots and grant certificates make rules of pilotage appoint the lighthouse keeper and provide for the building of more piers in which vessels might take shelter Their accounts were laid yearly before the Accounts Committee of the Assembly Finally in I803 the groundwork of the present system was adopted The law provided for one warden and six assistant wardens four of whom should be inhabitants of the city of Philadelphia one of the Northern Liberties and one of the District of Southwark The Governor was authorized to appoint a harbor master removable at pleasure The duties of the wardens were to grant licenses to persons to act as pilots in the bay and river Delaware and to make rules for their government while employed in that service to decide all differences which arose between masters owners and consignees of ships or vessels and pilots except in certain cases to direct the moving of ships and vessels in the harbor and the order in which they should lay load or unload at the wharves and to make ordain and publish such rules and regulations and with such penalties for the breach thereof in respect of the matters before mentioned as they should deem fitting and proper In I85I the Legislature passed a law17 declaring that no previous law should be construed to authorize the building or extension of 1 Pennsylvania Laws 1851 p 862 503 73The Annals of the American Academy wharves on the river Delaware in front of the city and county of Philadelphia or the establishment of wharf lines unless the wharf lines should first be approved by the Board of Wardens for the Port of Philadelphia At this time the Board consisted of the Master Warden appointed by the Governor and thirteen port wardens appointed by the Select and Common Councils and the Commissioners of the Boroughs of Bridesburg Richmond Kensington the Northern Liberties South wark and Moyamensing In 1853 the jurisdiction of the Board was extended over the entire county and only wharves licensed by them were lawful struc tures The Board was now made to consist of one master appointed by the Governor and sixteen assistant wardens elected by the Select and Common Councils This Act made it the duty of Councils to fix wharf lines beyond which no wharf or pier may be built to keep the navigable water within the city open and free from obstruc tions to regulate pilots and the better disposition of vessels within the port An Act of March 31 I864 made it the duty of the Board of Wardens guided by the plan prepared by the City Surveyor to fix the wharf lines of Delaware County beyond which they could not authorize the construction of any wharf or pier In the same year they were given the authority to fix an arbitrary low water mark beyond which no encroachment nor improvement should be made without a license from the Board In 1870 owing to a decision of the Supreme Court18 above mentioned the Board of Port Wardens was constituted a depart ment of the city known as the Department of Port Wardens all its receipts being paid into the city treasury and its accounts audited by the City Controller Previous to this the Master Warden and Harbor Master had received a fee of seventyfive cents collected from each vessel coming into the harbor The fee having been declared unconstitutional the payment of the salaries was assumed by the State government The Board of Wardens has supervision of the port of Phila delphia under the guidance of the State and the municipal govern ments and operates principally through the Master Warden and the sSteamship Company vs Portwardens 6 Wallace 31 504 74American System of Commercial Facilities Harbor Master who has charge of the placing of vessels the cleaning of docks and wharves and other similar duties Summary In the past we have thought of harbors and transportation terminals as places where commerce was halted now we are learning to think of them as integral parts of the great carrying systems parts where speed and freedom of movement must be unrestricted where discriminations and petty bickerings which result from unre strained competition must be eliminated While our foreign trade was comparatively small and seagoing vessels of shallow draft the equipment of harbors was of less importance but with our immense and rapidly growing foreign trade and with moder ocean vessels that draw from twentyseven to thirtythree feet special harbor facilities are indispensable In I902 561 vessels with a loaded draft of from twentyseven to thirtythree feet left New York harbor In order to provide for such vessels as these the Federal Government is deepening and improving our channel ways and giving increased power and supervision to the Secretary of War The State and the municipal governments are centralizing the responsibilities of their Harbor Commissioners and granting specific powers as well as general supervision The Board of Docks in New York City has been superseded by the Commissioner of Docks The powers of the Boston Harbor and Land Commissioners have been increased by authority to construct the South Boston pier The New Orleans Board of Commissioners was given authority to repossess themselves of the river front farmed out under the ten year lease and to regulate the commerce and traffic of the harbor in such manner as may in their judgment be best while the harbor of San Francisco and the shore line of the State of Washington are under the direct guardianship of the State Government As stated earlier in the paper the Federal Government has con trol over the channels of rivers between wharf lines and the State Governments have control over the docks and wharves In some States this authority is exercised through the municipalities as is the case

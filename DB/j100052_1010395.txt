J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010395,THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF IMPROVING AND ADMINISTERING COMMERCIAL FACILITIES,I242564,THE AMERICAN SYSTEM OF IMPROVING AND ADMIN ISTERING COMMERCIAL FACILITIES IN THIS PAPER THE ENDEAVOR WILL BE TO COLLATE THE LEGISLATION OF THE FEDERAL AND OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS ON THE SUBJECT OF COMMERCIAL FACILITIES AND TO DISCOVER IF POSSIBLE THE GENERAL TREND OF LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITY THE STUDY OF HARBORS THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN RAILWAY AND OCEAN TRANSPORTATION BECOMES OF INCREASING INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE AS FOREIGN TRADE DEVELOPS UNLESS HARBORS ARE PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED AND EFFICIENTLY REGULATED FOREIGN TRADE IS OF NECESSITY HEAVILY HANDI CAPPED PREVIOUS TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION THE VARIOUS STATES REGULATED THEIR COMMERCE AS SO MANY SEPARATE NATIONS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING A MERELY NOMINAL SUGGESTIVE POWER NOT ONLY WAS THERE NO UNIFORMITY IN THEIR LEGISLATION THERE WAS BITTER ANTAGONISM STATES ENDEAVORING TO ENACT LAWS TO CRIPPLE THE COMMERCE OF OTHER STATES IN THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION AND EQUIPMENT OF HARBOR AND WHARF FACILITIES INDIVIDUALS WERE LEFT LARGELY TO FOLLOW THEIR OWN WHIMS AND DESIRES FROM SUCH A CONDITION OF AFFAIRS THERE HAS BEEN A STEADY CHANGE FIRST TOWARD MORE ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE STATE GOVERNMENTS AND LATER ON THE PART OF THE FEDERAL GOVERN MENT THE CONSTITUTION GIVES CONGRESS THE POWER TO LAY AND COLLECT TAXES DUTIES IMPOSTS AND EXCISES WHICH SHALL BE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES TO REGULATE COMMERCE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES AND WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES AND LIKEWISE PLACES THE FOLLOWING RESTRICTIONS ON THE STATES NO STATE SHALL WITHOUT THE CON SENT OF CONGRESS LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS EXCEPT WHAT MAY BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF ITS INSPECTION LAWS AND NO STATE SHALL WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS LAY ANY DUTY OF TONNAGE BUT THESE CLAUSES OF THE CONSTITUTION LIKE MANY OTHERS MEANT LITTLE UNTIL INTERPRETED BY THE SUPREME COURT AND JUDICIAL DECISIONS IN A SERIES OF CASES FROM 1824 TO 1884 WERE NECESSARY TO ESTABLISH AN APPARENT UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE REGULATION OF RIVERS AND HARBORS 489THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY LEGAL DECISIONS DISTINGUISHING BETWEEN FEDERAL AND STATE AUTHORITY BY THE ACT OF MARCH I9 1787 THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW YORK GRANTED TO JOHN FITCH THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE RIGHT OF MAKING AND USING EVERY KIND OF BOAT OR VESSEL IMPELLED BY STEAM ON ALL CREEKS RIVERS BAYS AND WATERS WITHIN THE TERRITORY AND JURISDICTION OF THE STATE FOR A PERIOD OF FOURTEEN YEARS JOHN FITCH IT APPEARS FAILED TO EXERCISE THE EXTENSIVE POWERS BESTOWED UPON HIM AND BY A NUMBER OF ACTS THIS RIGHT WAS TRANSFERRED TO ROBERT R LIVINGSTONE AND ROBERT FULTON CHANGED ONLY AS TO THE TIME LIMIT OF THE MONOPOLY BY THESE ACTS THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT WAS GIVEN THEM TO USE STEAM NAVI GATION ON ALL THE WATERS OF NEW YORK FOR A TERM OF THIRTY YEARS FROM I808 ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF NEW YORK ANY STEAM VESSEL WITHOUT A LIVINGSTONE AND FULTON LICENSE WAS LIABLE TO SEIZURE AND FORFEITURE IF FOUND WITHIN THE WATERS OF THE STATE OPPOSED TO THIS WAS A CONNECTICUT LAW FORBIDDING ANY VESSEL WITH SUCH A LICENSE FROM ENTERING THE STATE AND ACCORDING TO A NEW JERSEY LAW IF THE REPRESENTATIVES OF LIVINGSTONE AND FULTON CARRIED INTO EFFECT BY JUDICIAL PROCESS THE PROVISIONS OF THE NEW YORK LAWS THEY EXPOSED THEMSELVES TO A STATE ACTION IN NEW JERSEY FOR ALL DAMAGES AND TREBLE COSTS THIS LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FINALLY CAME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IN THE YEAR I824 IN THE FAMOUS GIBBONS VS OGDEN CASE AND THE DECISION WAS THE ENTERING WEDGE IN THE SEPARATION OF STATE AND FEDERAL AUTHORITY OVER NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF ITS REPUGNANCE TO THAT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION GIVING CONGRESS POWER TO REGULATE COMMERCE WITH FOREIGN NATIONS AMONG THE SEVERAL STATES AND WITH THE INDIAN TRIBES THIS LAW WAS DECLARED UNCONSTITUTIONAL INSOFAR AS IT PROHIBITED VESSELS LICENSED ACCORDING TO THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM CARRYING ON THE COASTING TRADE AND FROM NAVIGATING THE WATERS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN OTHER WORDS NO STATE MAY EXCLUDE VESSELS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM HER WATERS THE NEXT PHASE OF THE QUESTION WAS BROUGHT TO LIGHT IN THE STATE OF MARYLAND IN 1821 THE LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW THAT ALL IMPORTERS OF FOREIGN ARTICLES OR COMMODITIES OF DRY GOODS WARES OR MERCHANDISE BY BALE OR PACKAGE OR WINE RUM BRANDY WHISKY AND OTHER DISTILLED SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS ETC AND THOSE PERSONS SELLING THE SAME BY WHOLE SALE BALE OR PACKAGE HOGSHEAD BARREL OR TIERCE SHOULD BEFORE THEY 9 WHEATON 1 490 60AMERICAN SYSTEM OF COMMERCIAL FACILITIES WERE AUTHORIZED TO SELL TAKE OUT A LICENSE FOR WHICH THEY WERE TO PAY 50 IN 1827 THE SUPREME COURT2 DECLARED THIS LAW UNCONSTITUTIONAL BEING CONTRARY TO THE CLAUSE NO STATE SHALL WITHOUT THE CON SENT OF CONGRESS LAY ANY IMPOSTS OR DUTIES ON IMPORTS AND EXPORTS AND ALSO TO THE CLAUSE CONGRESS SHALL HAVE POWER TO REGULATE COMMERCE    THAT IS A TAX ON IMPORTERS IS A TAX ON AND A REGULATION OF COMMERCE AND THEREFORE UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE MATTER OF REGISTRATION WAS THE NEXT POINT TO COME BEFORE THE SUPREME COURTS IN 1854 THE STATE OF ALABAMA PASSED A LAW REQUIRING THE OWNERS OF STEAMBOATS NAVIGATING THE WATERS OF THE STATE BEFORE A BOAT SHOULD LEAVE THE PORT OF MOBILE TO FILE A STATEMENT IN WRITING IN THE OFFICE OF THE PROBATE JUDGE OF MOBILE COUNTY SETTING FORTH FIRST THE NAME OF THE VESSEL SECOND THE NAME OF THE OWNER OR OWNERS THIRD HIS OR THEIR PLACE OF RESIDENCE AND FOURTH THE INTER EST EACH HAS IN THE VESSEL THIS LAW ALSO WAS DECLARED UNCONSTITU TIONAL INSOFAR AS IT APPLIED TO A VESSEL WHICH HAD TAKEN OUT A LICENSE AND WAS DULY ENROLLED UNDER THE ACT OF CONGRESS FOR CARRYING ON THE COASTING TRADE AND PLIED BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND THE CITIES OF WETUMPKA AND MONTGOMERY IN ALABAMA SPECIAL STATE REGISTRATION IS AN UNLAWFUL REQUIREMENT OF VESSELS ENGAGED IN COASTWISE TRADE THE CASE OF FOSTER VS DAVENPORT DIFFERED FROM THE ABOVE CASE IN THIS RESPECT ONLY THAT THE VESSEL SEIZED FOR NONCOMPLIANCE WAS ENGAGED IN LIGHTERING TO AND FROM VESSELS ANCHORED IN THE LOWER BAY OF MOBILE AND THE WHARVES OF THE CITY AND IN TOWING VESSELS ANCHORED THERE TO AND FROM THE CITY AND IN SOME INSTANCES TOWING THE SAME BEYOND THE OUTER BAR OF THE BAY AND INTO THE GULF TO A DISTANCE OF SEVERAL MILES BUT WAS DULY ENROLLED AND LICENSED TO CARRY ON THE COAST ING TRADE WHILE ENGAGED IN THIS BUSINESS THE ARGUMENT OF THE COURT BEING THAT LIGHTERING OR TOWING WAS BUT A PROLONGATION OF THE VOYAGE OF THE VESSELS ASSISTED TO THEIR PORT OF DESTINATION THE NEXT CASE5 DEALT WITH THE SUBJECT OF TAXATION IN I866 THE STATE OF ALABAMA PASSED A REVENUE LAW FIXING THE RATE OF TAXATION FOR PROPERTY GENERALLY AT ONEHALF OF ONE PER CENT BUT ON ALL THE STEAM BOATS VESSELS OR OTHER WATERCRAFT PLYING IN THE NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE STATE THE TATE WAS PLACED AT ONE DOLLAR PER TON OF THE REGULATED TONNAGE TO BE COLLECTED IF PRACTICABLE AT THE PORT WHERE SUCH VESSELS 2 BROWN VS MARYLAND 12 WHEATON 419 SINNOT VS DAVENPORT 22 HOWARD 227 4

QUESTION WERE ENROLLED AND LICENSED FOR CARRYING ON THE COASTWISE TRADE BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT PLIED ONLY ON WATERS WITHIN THE STATE THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED THAT ALTHOUGH TAXES LEVIED AS ON PROPERTY BY A STATE UPON VESSELS OWNED BY ITS CITIZENS AND BASED ON THE VALUATION OF THE SAME ARE NOT PROHIBITED BY THE CONSTITUTION YET TAXES CANNOT BE IMPOSED ON THEM BY A STATE AT SO MUCH PER TON OF THE REGISTERED TONNAGE VESSELS HAVE LONG BEEN OBLIGED TO PAY PILOTAGE WHETHER ASSISTED TO AND FROM THE HARBORS BY PILOTS OR NOT AND IN 1855 THE STATE LEGIS LATURE OF LOUISIANA AUTHORIZED THE MASTER AND WARDENS OF THE PORT OF NEW ORLEANS TO COLLECT FIVE DOLLARS FROM EVERY VESSEL ARRIVING AT THE PORT WHETHER CALLED UPON TO PERFORM ANY SERVICE FOR THE VESSEL OR NOT BUT IN 1867 THESUPREMECOURTE PRONOUNCED THE LAW A REGU LATION OF COMMERCE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL SINCE IT WAS A TAX LEVIED ON ALL SHIPS IT WAS FURTHER STATED THAT THE FEES OF THE MASTER AND WARDENS DIFFERED FROM THAT OF THE PILOTS IN THAT THE PILOT LAWS OF THE STATES RECEIVED FEDERAL CONFIRMATION IN I789 AND ALSO THAT THE PILOT LAWS REST ON CONTRACT IE PAYMENT FOR ACTUAL SERVICE THE LAST IMPORTANT CASE OF THIS SERIES WAS THAT OF MORAN VS NEW ORLEANS7 IN 1870 THE STATE AUTHORIZED THE CITY OF NEW ORLEANS TO LEVY IMPOSE AND COLLECT A TAX UPON ALL PERSONS PURSUING ANY TRADE PROFESSION OR CALLING AND TO PROVIDE FOR ITS COLLECTION AND FURTHER ADDED THAT THIS LAW SHOULD NOT BE CONSTRUED TO BE A TAX ON PROPERTY UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THIS ACT THE CITY ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING LICENSE EVERY MEMBER OF A FIRM OR COMPANY EVERY AGENT PERSON OR CORPORATION OWNING AND RUNNING TOWBOATS TO AND FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO 500 COOPER WAS THE OWNER OF TWO STEAM PRO PELLERS EACH MEASURING OVER IOO TONS DULY ENROLLED AND LICENSED AT THE PORT OF NEW ORLEANS UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE COASTING TRADE UPON HIS REFUSAL TO PAY THE LICENSE JUDGMENT WAS OBTAINED BY THE CITY AND SUSTAINED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HOW EVER DECIDED THAT THE LICENSE WAS IN REALITY A CHARGE MADE UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE FOR THE PRIVILEGE OF EMPLOYING VESSELS IN THE MANNER AUTHORIZED BY THE LICENSE OF THE UNITED STATES AND WAS THERE FORE A RESTRICTION OF COMMERCE AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL  STEAMSHIP CO VS PORTWARDENS 6 WALL 31 112 US 69 492 62AMERICAN SYSTEM OF COMMERCIAL FACILITIES THIS CHRONOLOGICAL REVIEW OF LAWS AND COURT FINDINGS IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO GET SOME IDEA OF THE RELATION OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE CONTROL OF VESSELS PLYING TO AND FROM OUR PORTS VESSELS MAY BE TAXED BY THE STATE GOVERNMENTS BUT SUCH TAXATION MUST BE BASED ON PROPERTY VALUE AND BE COLLECTED AT PORT OF REGISTRA TION AND NO VESSEL LICENSED AND ENROLLED UNDER THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES FOR CARRYING ON THE COASTWISE TRADE MAY BE BURDENED BY ANY SPECIAL REGISTRATION LICENSE FEE OR TONNAGE TAX BY ANY STATE THE CONSTITUTION HAS BEEN INTERPRETED STRICTLY AND THE STATES ARE LIMITED IN THEIR TAXATION OF COMMERCE TO WHAT MAY BE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR THE EXECUTION OF THEIR INSPECTION LAWS GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL OF PILOTS AND PILOTAGE PILOTS ARE LARGELY UNDER STATE CONTROL PRIOR TO I789 MOST OF THE STATES HAD ADOPTED PILOT LAWS AND THESE LAWS WERE EARLY CONFIRMED BY CONGRESS8 IN THESE WORDS UNTIL FURTHER PROVISION IS MADE BY CONGRESS ALL PILOTS IN BAYS INLETS RIVERS HARBORS AND PORTS SHALL CONTINUE TO BE REGULATED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATES WHEREIN SUCH PILOTS MAY BE OR WITH SUCH LAWS AS THE STATES MAY RESPECTFULLY ENACT FOR THE PURPOSE FRICTION SOON AROSE BETWEEN SUCH STATES AS PENN SYLVANIA AND DELAWARE BOTH OF WHICH HAVE PILOTS COMPETING FOR SER VICE TO AND FROM PORTS ON THE DELAWARE RIVER GIVING OPPORTUNITY TO VESSELS TO DISCRIMINATE BETWEEN THE PILOTS OF THE TWO STATES THIS LED TO A LAW OF THE UNITED STATES REQUIRING THE MASTER OF ANY VESSEL COMING INTO OR GOING OUT OF ANY PORT SITUATED UPON WATERS WHICH ARE THE BOUNDARY OF TWO STATES TO ACCEPT THE FIRST QUALIFIED PILOT WHO OFFERS HIS SERVICES WHETHER HE BE LICENSED IN ONE STATE OR THE OTHER THE REVISED STATUTES OF THE UNITED STATES NO 4237 PROHIBIT ANY STATE FROM MAKING ANY DISCRIMINATION IN THE RATE OF PILOTAGE OR HALF PILOTAGE BETWEEN VESSELS SAILING BETWEEN PORTS OF ONE STATE AND VES SELS SAILING BETWEEN PORTS OF DIFFERENT STATES REVISED STATUTES NO

WHICH WILL IMPEDE PILOTS IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR DUTIES EXCEPT FOR THESE GENERAL REGULATIONS THE CONTROL OF PILOTS AND PILOTAGE IS LEFT TO THE STATE AND MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS TAKING PHILADELPHIA 8 REVISED STATUTES 4235 493 63THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FOR AN ILLUSTRATION ONE OF THE DUTIES OF THE BOARD OF WARDENS IS TO LICENSE PILOTS AND MAKE RULES FOR THEIR GOVERNMENT THERE ARE EIGHTYFOUR PILOTS HALF OF WHOM ARE LICENSED BY THE STATE OF PENN SYLVANIA AND HALF BY THE STATE OF DELAWARE THEY SERVE IN TURN FIRSTCLASS PILOTS TAKING VESSELS WITH DRAFT OF EIGHTEEN FEET AND OVER AND

UPWARDS IS 488 PER FOOT AT BALTIMORE PILOTAGE IS COMPULSORY THERE ARE FIFTYFOUR PILOTS LICENSED YEARLY BY THE STATE THE RATE OF PILOTAGE ON VESSELS OF FIFTEEN FEET DRAFT AND OVER IS 5 PER FOOT IMPROVEMENT AND CONTROL OF WATERWAYS IN THE FIRST PART OF THE PAPER WE ENDEAVORED TO DISCOVER THE RELA TION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE GENERAL OVERSIGHT OF VESSELS AND CARGOES AS THEY COME AND GO IN THE HARBORS OF THE UNITED STATES ATTENTION WILL NOW BE DIRECTED TO THE RE LATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL AND THE STATE GOVERNMENTS IN THE MAIN TENANCE IMPROVEMENT AND CONTROL OF WATERWAYS9 IN A GENERAL WAY IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AUTHORITY OVER THE CHANNELS OF RIVERS BETWEEN THE WHARF LINES AND THAT THE STATES HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE DOCKS WHARVES AND OTHER CONVENIENCES FOR LOADING AND UNLOADING CARGOES THIS AUTHORITY IS SOMETIMES EXERCISED DIRECTLY AS IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON WHERE THE STATE HAS MADE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FOR THE PROTECTION

INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE IS LARGELY LEFT UNGUIDED AND UNCONTROLLED ON THE OTHER HAND INDIVIDUALS CORPORATIONS AND STATE AUTHORITIES ARE NOT PROHIBITED FROM IMPROVING RIVER CHANNELS BUT ARE SUB JECTED TO THE REGULATION OF CONGRESS THE SECRETARY OF WAR AND THE CHIEF OF ENGINEERS OF THE ARMY PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF THE CONSTITUTION THE STATES EXERCISED THEIR SOVEREIGNTY IMPROVED WATERWAYS AND LEVIED TOLLS TO MEET THEIR EXPENDITURES AFTER I789 THE LIGHTHOUSES BEACONS BUOYS AND PUBLIC PIERS WERE CEDED TO THE UNITED STATES AND THE CARE OF THEM NO LONGER DEVOLVED ON THE STATE GOVERNMENTS THUS REMOVING THE PRINCIPAL OCCASION FOR THE COLLECTION OF DUTIES HOWEVER THE COLLECTION OF TONNAGE DUTIES DID NOT CEASE IMMEDIATELY AND CONGRESS PASSED FREQUENT ENABLING ACTS EMPOWERING STATES TO COLLECT DUTIES FOR NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS IF A STATE WISHED TO MAKE SOME RIVER OR HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS SHE WOULD LAY HER PLANS BEFORE CONGRESS AND IF AP PROVED RECEIVE AUTHORITY TO COLLECT BY MEANS OF TAXATION OF COMMERCE SUFFICIENT FUNDS FOR THE COMPLETION OF THE ENTERPRISE FOR EXAMPLE IN I8O6 CONGRESS PASSED AN ENABLING ACT TO EMPOWER THE BOARD OF WARDENS FOR THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA TO COLLECT A DUTY OF FOUR CENTS PER TON ON ALL VESSELS CLEARING FROM THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA FOR ANY PORT OR PLACE WHATSOEVER TO BE EXPENDED IN BUILDING PIERS AND OTHER WISE IMPROVING THE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER DELAWARE REMOVAL OF OBSTRUCTIONS FROM CHANNELS DURING THE ENTIRE FIRST HALF OF THE CENTURY THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN NO CLEAR UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO SUPERVISE THE WATERWAYS OF THE UNITED STATES AND KEEP THEM IN SUITABLE CON DITION TO INSURE SAFETY AND RAPIDITY TO COMMERCE EVEN AS LATE AS 1859 THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF PENNSYLVANIA PASSED AN ACT INTRODUCED BY THE FOLLOWING PREAMBLE WHICH PLAINLY INDICATES THE UN CERTAINTY AS TO WHERE THE DUTY SHOULD REST WHEREAS FREQUENT OBSTRUCTIONS TO THE SAFE NAVIGATION OF THE RIVER DELAWARE AND THE RIVER SCHUYLKILL WITHIN THE TIDEWATERS THEREOF DO FREQUENTLY OCCUR BY THE SINKING OF CANAL BOATS BARGES AND OTHER VESSELS AND THERE BEING NO ADEQUATE REMEDY TO COMPEL THE OWNER MASTER OR OTHER AGENT HAVING CHARGE THEREOF TO RAISE AND REMOVE THE SAME THE ACT AUTHORIZED THE MASTER WARDEN OF THE PORT OF PHILADELPHIA IMMEDIATELY UPON INFORMATION OF THE SINKING OF ANY VESSEL IN THE OHANNLM OF THE TIDE 495 65THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WATERS OF THE DELAWARE OR SCHUYLKILL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE PORT TO NOTIFY THE OWNER TO RAISE THE SAME WITHIN TEN DAYS UNDER PENALTY AND UPON FAILURE OF OWNER TO REMOVE THE WRECK THE MASTER WARDEN SHOULD DO SO SELLING THE CARGO TO MEET THE EXPENSES IN 1864 THE ACT WAS AMENDED BY AUTHORIZING THE MASTER WARDEN TO RECOVER DAMAGES FROM THE OWNER NOT UNTIL I880 DID CONGRESS TAKE ACTION UPON THIS SUBJECT10 IN THAT YEAR THE SECRETARY OF WAR WAS AUTHORIZED IN CASE OF THE OBSTRUCTION OF ANY NAVIGABLE WATERWAY OF THE UNITED STATES RIVER LAKE HARBOR OR BAY TO GIVE PROPER NOTICE TO ALL PERSONS INTER ESTED IN THE CRAFT OR CARGO TO REMOVE THE SAME AND UPON THEIR FAILURE TO DO SO THE SECRETARY OF WAR SHOULD TREAT THE SUNKEN VESSEL AS ABANDONED AND DERELICT REMOVING AND SELLING BOTH VESSEL AND CARGO AND DEPOSITING THE PROCEEDS IN THE TREASURY OF THE UNITED STATES TO THE CREDIT OF A FUND FOR THE REMOVAL OF SUCH OBSTRUCTIONS THIS ACT REMAINED UNCHANGED FOR TWO YEARS BUT IN I882 THE POWERS OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR WERE ENLARGED BY AUTHORIZING HIM TO SELL THE VESSEL AND CARGO BEFORE RAISING THE SAME IN I89O HE WAS FURTHER AUTHOR IZED 1 TO BREAK UP AND REMOVE WITHOUT ANY LIABILITY FOR DAMAGE TO THE OWNER ANY WRECK OR OBSTRUCTION THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO REMAIN MORE THAN TWO MONTHS IN SECTION SIX OF THE SAME ACT CONGRESS FORBIDS THE CASTING FROM ANY BOAT PIER OR MANUFACTURING ESTABLISH MENT ANY BALLAST GRAVEL CINDERS SAWDUST OR OTHER WASTE INTO ANY OF THE NAVIGABLE WATERS OF THE UNITED STATES AND WHERE THE CASTING OF SUCH MATERIAL INTO NAVIGABLE WATERWAYS IS NECESSARY FOR THE IMPROVE MENT OF THE SAME A PERMIT FROM THE SECRETARY OF WAR MUST BE OBTAINED CONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGES DAMS AND DYKES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVING ASSUMED THE DUTY OF KEEPING THE CHANNELS FREE FROM OBSTRUCTIONS WOULD NATURALLY TAKE THE NEXT STEP OF DEFINING MORE ACCURATELY THE BOUNDARIES OF WATERWAYS ON MARCH 3 I899 CONGRESS IN ORDER TO FURTHER PROTECT THE CHANNELS OF WATERWAYS PASSED AN ACT REGULATING THE CONSTRUCTION OF BRIDGES DAMS AND DYKES MAKING IT UNLAWFUL TO CONSTRUCT OR COMMENCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF ANY BRIDGE DAM DYKE OR CAUSEWAY OVER OR IN ANY PORT ROADSTEAD HAVEN HARBOR CANAL

PRO VIDED THE LOCATION AND PLANS THEREOF ARE SUBMITTED TO AND APPROVED BY THE CHIEF OF ENGINEERS OF THE ARMY AND THE SECRETARY OF WAR BEFORE CONSTRUCTION IS COMMENCED THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE BUILD ING OF A STRUCTURE OVER A RIVER WHOLLY WITHIN A SINGLE STATE AND ONE WHICH FORMS THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN TWO STATES IS THAT IN THE LATTER CASE THE CONSENT OF CONGRESS MUST BE OBTAINED WHICH IS NOT NECESSARY IN THE FORMER BUT IN BOTH INSTANCES THE PLANS MUST BE APPROVED BY THE CHIEF OF ENGINEERS OF THE ARMY AND SECRETARY OF WAR PLANS ONCE APPROVED MUST NOT BE DEVIATED FROM IN THE LEAST EITHER

IT IS DEEMED AN OBSTRUCTION OF FREE NAVIGATION IN GIVING AN ORDER FOR RECONSTRUCTION THE NOTICE MUST BE ACCOMPANIED BY A PLAN OF THE CHANGE RECOMMENDED BY THE CHIEF OF ENGINEERS OF THE ARMY FAILURE TO

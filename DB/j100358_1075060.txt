AN AID IN THE ACQUISITION OF A VOCAB ULARY F W SCHACHT WENDELL PHILLIPS HIGH SCHOOL CHICAGO OF THE DIFFERENT METHODS OF ACQUIRING A VOCABULARY WHICH ARE TREATED IN THESE PAPERS THAT MAKING USE OF DERIVATIVES AND COMPOSITES OFFERS PERHAPS THE MOST EXTENSIVE FIELD AND AT THE SAME TIME AVOIDS THE CHARGE THAT IT IS A TRANSLATION METHOD WHICH CAN BE MADE AGAINST THE STUDY OF COGNATES AND SYNONYMS JUST AS IN THE STUDY OF COGNATES IT IS NECESSARY TO UNDERSTAND THE SIMPLER PRINCIPLES WHICH UNDERLIE THEIR FORMATION SO IN THE STUDY OF DERIVATIVES THE METHODS AND RULES SHOULD BE FAIRLY WELL UNDERSTOOD THE IMPORTANCE OF DERIVATIVES IN THE STUDY OF LANGUAGES HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY TREATED THE LAYMANS IDEA IS PROBABLY BASED ON MARK TWAINS ASSERTION THAT WITH A VOCABULARY CONSISTING OF THE WORDS ZUG SCHLAG AND ALSO ONE CAN GET ALONG VERY WELL IN GERMANY IN THE DICTIONARY THERE ARE THREE COLUMNS OF COMPOUNDS WITH THE SECOND ALONE BEGINNING WITH SCHLAGADER WHICH MEANS ARTERY AND GOING CLEAR THROUGH THE ALPHABET TO SCHLAGWASSER WHICH MEANS BILGEWATER BUT THAT THING WHICH IT DOES NOT MEAN HAS NOT YET BEEN DIS COVERED THIS INDICATES IN AN EXAGGERATED WAY WHAT HAS BEEN APTLY CALLED THE PICTORIAL QUALITY OF THE GERMAN LANGUAGE AND TO WHAT AN EXTENT AND WITH WHAT FACILITY THIS LANGUAGE LENDS ITSELF TO COMPOSITION STILL I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT THE GENIAL MARK TWAIN HAS NOT OVERSTATED THE MATTER VERY MUCH AFTER BEING ASKED TO DISCUSS THIS SUBJECT I MADE IT A POINT TO CHECK UP ONE OF THESE WORDS NAMELY ZIEHEN LIMITING THE COMPOUNDS FIRST TO THOSE IN WHICH SOME FORM OF THE WORD WAS THE FIRST COMPONENT AND SECOND TO THOSE IN WHICH THE COMPOSITION WAS WITH ONE OF THE INSEPARABLE PREFIXES OR THE THREE COMMONLY GIVEN GROUPS OF PREPOSITIONS OF THE FIRST SORT THERE WERE 90 OF THE SECOND 171 OR A TOTAL OF 261 AND THE SEARCH WAS NOT AT ALL THOROUGH IF NOW NOUNS AND VERBS AND OTHER PARTS OF SPEECH HAD ALSO BEEN120 THE SCHOOL REVIEW TAKEN I FEEL CERTAIN THE NUMBER WOULD HAVE EXCEEDED 4O0 PERHAPS 5OO NOT ALL WORDS MAY FORM COMPOUNDS SO FREELY BUT POSSIBLY THERE ARE OTHERS FROM WHICH EVEN MORE MAY BE FORMED APPROACHING THE SAME QUESTION FROM A DIFFERENT STANDPOINT FIVE TEXTS IN COMMON USE WERE TAKEN AND THE VOCABULARIES WERE SEARCHED FOR EXAMPLES IN EACH CASE THE WORDS WERE CHOSEN HAPHAZARD AND THE RESULTS AVERAGED AS FOLLOWS IMMENSEE IO WORDS AN AVERAGE OF 49 DERIVATIVES TO EACH WORD H HER ALS DIE KIRCHE 10 WORDS AVERAGE 82 DAS KALTE HERZ 70 WORDS AVERAGE 4 GLIICK AUF 50 WORDS AVERAGE 72 DER ZERBROCHENE KRUG 30 WORDS AVERAGE 76 THE LAST RESULTS WERE OBTAINED BY A CLASS OF FIFTEEN THIRDYEAR PUPILS WHO WERE GIVEN A FEW EXAMPLES AS SCHREIBEN SCHRIFT SCHRIFTLICH VORSCHRIFT AND ASKED TO TAKE TWO WORDS EACH ONLY ONE WORD WAS FOUND WITHOUT ANY DERIVATIVE OCCASIONALLY THEY WERE LED INTO ERROR AS WHEN FOR INSTANCE THEY DERIVED FINGER FROM FANGEN AN ERROR HOWEVER WHICH EMINENT PHILOLOGISTS SEEM ALSO TO HAVE MADE ANOTHER TEST WAS ON THE ABILITY OF THE STUDENT TO FORM DERIVA TIVES FROM HIS OWN VOCABULARY THE PROBLEM SELECTED WAS TO FORM FEMININE ABSTRACTS FROM ADJECTIVES AS KALT DIE KIILTE IN NO CASE WERE THERE LESS THAN EIGHT FOUND AND IN SEVERAL CASES ALMOST TWICE THAT NUMBER BUT THE PURPOSE OF STUDYING DERIVATIVES AND COMPOSITES I TAKE IT IS NOT SO MUCH TO ENABLE THE PUPIL TO FORM THEM FOR HIM SELF AS TO AID HIM IN RECOGNIZING THEM WHEN FOUND IN THE TEXT AS ALREADY STATED IN THE BEGINNING SOME OF THE UNDERLYING PRIN CIPLES SHOULD BE UNDERSTOOD AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE ROOTS OR PRIMITIVE PARTS OF THE LANGUAGE AND SOME OF THE METHODS OF COMPOUNDING AND VARYING THESE MAY BRIEFLY BE GIVEN THERE ARE TWO GENERAL METHODS WHICH MAY BE TERMED EXTER NAL AND INTERNAL DERIVATIVES FORMED BY THE FIRST METHOD ARE COMPARATIVELY BUT ONLY COMPARATIVELY RARE MOST OF THEM FALL ING INTO THE SECOND CLASS INTERNAL CHANGES THESE MAY BE GROUPED UNDER TWO HEADS THE THIRD REDUPLI CATION HAVING PRACTICALLY BEEN LOST I ABLAUT 2 CHANGE

COLLECTIVE IDEA EXPRESSED BY THE PREFIX GE AS BUSCH GEBIISCH WACHSEN GEWIICHS EXAMPLES UNDER EACH OF THESE MIGHT BE MULTIPLIED INDEFI NITELY BUT IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT MANY DERIVATIVES WILL NOT FALL INTO ANY OF THESE GROUPS CHANGE OF CONSONANTS THESE MAY BE OF TWO SORTS EITHER CHANGE IN VALUE OR CHANGE IN POSITION CHANGE OF POSITION IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE FORMS BRUNNEN BRONN BORN A CHANGE OF VALUE IS USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANGE OF MEANING AS IN RABE RAPPE BEISSEN BEIZEN COMPOSITION AS ALREADY STATED THIS IS THE MOST FRUITFUL SOURCE OF DERIVA TIVES BUT THERE IS ACTUALLY LESS VARIETY ABOUT IT THERE ARE TWO SORTS REAL AND UNREAL IN REAL COMPOSITION THE FIRST COMPONENT IS UNINFLECTED AS LANDMANN HIMMELBETT IN THE UNREAL THE FIRST COMPONENT IS INFLECTED AS LANDSMANN HERRENHAUS122 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THIS TOPIC IF GONE INTO IN DETAIL WOULD FILL VOLUMES AND ONLY A FEW CASES CAN BE TREATED HERE TAKING THE VERB SEHEN AS AN EXAMPLE AND USING THE INSEPARABLE PREFIXES ADVERBS AND PREPOSITIONS ONLY WE HAVE TO GIVE MERELY A PARTIAL LIST ANSEHEN VERB AND NOUN ANSICHT AUSSEHEN VERB AND NOUN AUS SICHT AUFSEHEN VERB AND NOUN AUFSICHT BESEHEN DURCHSEHEN DURCHSICHT DURCHSICHTIG

MEANINGS OF THE PREFIXES AND SUFFIXES IN SO FAR AS THEY HAVE ANY MEANING AT PRESENT MAY BE STUDIED TO SOME ADVANTAGE THE NOUN SUFFIX EI FOR INSTANCE HAS TWO QUITE GENERAL MEANINGS FIRST A BUSINESS OR THE PLACE OF BUSINESS AS ILLUSTRATED IN BIDCKEREI DRUCKEREI FISCHEREI GERBEREI ETC SECOND AN ACTION LONG CONTINUED PERHAPS TO THE POINT OF MONOTONY AS SCHREIBEREI SCHMEICHELEI ETC I SHOULD LIKE TO MENTION TWO FURTHER AIDS ALTHOUGH THESE ARE OPEN TO THE OBJECTION THAT THEY ARE TRANSLATION METHODS THE FIRST IS TO CALL ATTENTION TO THE SIMILARITY OF SOME OF THE COM POUNDS IN GERMAN AND ENGLISH AS FOR INSTANCE ZORNIG ANG E RY UNGLIICKLICHUNLUCKY MIINNLICHMANLY KINDISCHCHILDISH VORSICHTF ORESIGHT THE SECOND IS TO EMPHASIZE THE EQUIVALENCE OF LATIN AND GERMAN COMPOSITES AND AS EXAMPLES OF SUCH A FEW MUST SUF FICE AS AUSDRUCKEXPRESSION VORSICHTPROVIDENCE IIBERSETZENRANSLATE UNTERSCHREIBENSUBSCRIBE FIIR SPRECHERADVOCATE ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE LAST TWO POINTS COULD BE INDEFINITELY MUL TIPLIED BUT TO NO PURPOSE THE POINT IS IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IN THE HANDS OF A TEACHER WHO CAN RESTRAIN HIS OWN ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SUBJECT AND CAN MAKE THE ACQUISITION OF A VOCABULARY BY ALL THESE METHODS A MEANS TO AN END THE PLAN DISCUSSED MIGHT PROVE A BLESSING TO PUPILS WHO HAVE IN THE PAST LEARNED THEIR VOCABU LARIES AS MARK TWAIN PLAYED THE VIOLIN BY EAR AND MAIN STRENGTH

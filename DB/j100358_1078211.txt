J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1078211,FEDERAL AID TO PUBLIC EDUCATION,I244731,EIBURUAULLI 3AITRITINGU REVIEWS AND BOOK NOTES FEDERAL AID TO PUBLIC EDUCATIONWHETHER OR NOT IT IS APPARENT THAT THE NATION IS DEEPLY CONCERNED WITH THE PROBLEMS WHICH CONFRONT IT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPPORT AND DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION CERTAIN IT IS THAT THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE PRESSING NEED FOR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION OF THE POSSI BILITIES WHICH LIE WITHIN ANY COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF FEDERAL AID FOR SCHOOLS WITH THE PROSPECT THAT CONGRESS WILL AGAIN BE CALLED UPON TO VOTE ON THE SMITHTOWNER BILL IN ITS PRESENT FORM IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE DISCUSSION OF ITS PROVISIONS WILL BE WIDESPREAD AND THAT THE GREATEST POSSIBLE PUBLICITY WILL BE ATTAINED IT IS THEREFORE MOST OPPORTUNE THAT THE VOLUME PREPARED BY PRESIDENT KEITH AND PROFESSOR BAGLEY SHOULD APPEAR AT THIS TIME SETTING FOR THEMSELVES THE PROBLEM OF DEMONSTRATING HOW THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS MAY BE MADE EFFICIENT ON A NATIONWIDE BASIS THE AUTHORS TRACE THE HISTORY OF FEDERAL ENACTMENTS IN AID OF PUBLIC EDUCATION NOTING THE CONSISTENT TREND TOWARD LARGER SUPPORT OF A WIDER RANGE OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND CLOSING THIS PHASE OF THE DISCUSSION WITH A SUMMARY OF THOSE PRINCIPLES EMBODIED IN THESE ACTS WHICH DEFINE THE RIGHT OF CONGRESS TO SUPPORT SUCH MEASURES AS ARE NOW BEING PROPOSED A SECTION IS THEN GIVEN TO AN ANALYSIS OF THE DEFICIEN CIES OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS THESE WERE EMPHASIZED BY THE EXPERIENCES OF THE WAR PERIOD EXISTING ILLITERACY AND LACK OF EFFECTIVE AMERICANIZATION PLANS INADEQUATE SUPPORT OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS INEQUALITIES OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY INADEQUATE RURAL SCHOOLS AND POORLY TRAINED TEACHERS ARE AMONG THE CONDITIONS WHICH DEMAND RELIEF THE LATTER PORTION OF THE BOOK CONSIDERS THESE SEVERAL DEFICIENCIES IN THE LIGHT OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE SMITHTOWNER BILL THE READER CANNOT FAIL TO BE IMPRESSED WITH THE SPLENDID ORGANIZATION AND THE CLEARNESS OF PRESENTATION WHICH CHARACTERIZE THE HISTORICAL SURVEY AS GIVEN IN THE EARLIER CHAPTERS THE SECOND PHASE OF THE DISCUSSION IS LIKEWISE DIS CRIMINATING IN ITS ANALYSIS OF SUCH WEAKNESSES AS ARE NOTED AND THE CONDITIONS FROM WHICH THESE ARISE APART FROM THE FACT THAT CERTAIN GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WEAKNESSES ARE NOT MENTIONED THE BOOK THUS FAR SEEMS WELL CALCULATED TO ESTABLISH A PRACTICAL BASIS FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM SET FORTH IN THE AUTHORS STATEMENT OF THEIR PURPOSE JOHN A H KEITH AND WILLIAM C BAGLEY THE NATION AND ITS SCHOOLS NEW YORK MACMILLAN CO 1920 PP XVII364 68EDUCATIONAL WRITINGS 69 THERE ARE HOWEVER TWO OUTSTANDING FEATURES OF THE DISCUSSION WHICH SEEM NOT TO COMPORT WITH THIS ORIGINAL STATEMENT OF PURPOSE IN THE FIRST PLACE THE SEVERAL CHAPTERS DEALING WITH THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF THE SMITH TOWNER BILL AND THE CONDITIONS THESE SEEK TO IMPROVE REFUSE THROUGHOUT TO RECOGNIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY DEFICIENCIES IN THE BILL AS IT IS NOW DESIGNED LOGICAL AND FOR THE MOST PART OBJECTIVE IN ITS ANALYSIS OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS WHICH REQUIRE RELIEF THE TREATMENT TOO OFTEN ABANDONS ITS SCIENTIFIC PROCEDURE IN ITS APPLICATION TO SUCH SITUATIONS OF THE PARTICULAR PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL WHICH ARE SAID TO EFFECT THE NEEDED CHANGEAND THIS AT TIMES IN THE FACE OF THE CONTRARY EVIDENCE OF THE OBJECTIVE DATA ON WHICH THE DISCUSSION IS PRE SUMABLY BASED AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TYPE OF OVERZEALOUS SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE MAY BE TAKEN FROM THE DISCUSSION OF INEQUALITIES OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY IN CHAP TER XX WHICH TOPIC RECEIVES AN APPROPRIATE EMPHASIS IN THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BILL A TABLE IS PRESENTED P 268 SHOWING THE WEALTH PER PERSON OF SCHOOL AGE FOR EACH STATE THE CALCULATIONS BEING BASED ON THE CENSUS OF I9IO AND ESTIMATES OF WEALTH FOR 1912 USING THIS TABLE TO ESTABLISH THE FACT OF EXISTING INEQUALITIES IT IS POINTED OUT THAT THE TAXABLE WEALTH BEHIND EACH PERSON OF SCHOOL AGE VARIES FROM 2026I0 IN MISSISSIPPI TO 2736070 IN NEVADA  CALIFORNIA CAN RAISE 3000 FOR THE EDUCATION OF EACH PERSON OF SCHOOL AGE BY A MILLAGE ONESEVENTH AS LARGE AS IS NECES SARY IN MISSISSIPPI TO RAISE THE SAME AMOUNT THE TAX RATE IN MISSOURI WOULD HAVE TO BE TWICE AS GREAT AS IN IOWA TO RAISE A GIVEN SUM FOR EACH PERSON OF SCHOOL AGE P 269 A SECOND TABLE P 271 REDUCES CERTAIN FACTS OF WEALTH POPULATION AND AGE DISTRIBUTION TO A PERCENTAGE BASIS AND SIMILAR CONCRETE EXAMPLES OF GLARING INEQUALITIES ARE CITED A THIRD TABLE P 276 SHOWS HOW THE ALLOTMENT FOR THE EQUALIZATION OF EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY WILL BE DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE STATES ASSUMING THAT EACH TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE OF ITS OPPORTUNITY IN THIS RESPECT PRE SUMABLY THIS TABLE IS CONSTRUCTED TO SHOW THAT THE OPERATION OF THE ESPOUSED BILL WILL AT LEAST TEND TO ALLEVIATE THE CONDITIONS DESCRIBED BUT NO MENTION IS MADE OF IT AND NO SPECIFIC EXAMPLE IS DRAWN FROM IT TO AID THE AUTHORS IN ARRIVING AT THE UNQUALIFIED STATEMENT OF CONCLUSION THAT SUCH FEDERAL AID AS IS HERE ADVOCATED WOULD ULTIMATELY REMOVE THESE INEQUALITIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY P 272 SUPPOSEDLY THE REMOVAL OF INEQUALITIES BY THE APPLICATION OF THIS PROVISION OF THE SMITHTOWER BILL MEANS THE REMOVAL OF THE DISADVANTAGE UNDER WHICH MISSOURI LABORS IN AN EFFORT TO EQUAL THE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES AFFORDED BY IOWA ACCORDING TO THE TABLE PRESENTED MISSOURI WILL RECEIVE A TOTAL ALLOT MENT OF 5O10550 PER YEAR MORE THAN IS GIVEN TO IOWA FROM THE NECESSITY IMPOSED BY THE BILL OF PROVIDING AN EQUAL SUM BY STATE TAXATION MISSOURI WILL HAVE AVAILABLE SO FAR AS THIS PARTICULAR FUND IS CONCERNED A TOTAL OF 10211 MORE THAN IOWA WHICH OBVIOUSLY ADMITS OF NO APPRECIABLE REDUCTION IN THE RATE OF TAXATION REQUIRED FOR THE SUPPORT OF SCHOOLS MISSISSIPPI IS CONTRASTED70 THE SCHOOL REVIEW JANUARY WITH NEVADA AND WITH CALIFORNIA THE DATA OF THE TABLE MENTIONED SHOW THAT MISSISSIPPI WILL RECEIVE FROM THE EQUALIZATION FUND TWO AND ONEHALF TIMES THE AMOUNT GIVEN TO NEVADA BUT ONLY 85 PER CENT OF CALIFORNIAS SHARE THUS THE REAL EVIDENCE OF THE TABLE IS SIMPLY THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF FEDERAL AID AS CONTEMPLATED RESULTS IN ONE CASE IN AFFORDING A RELIEF SO MEAGER THAT IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE EFFORT IN ANOTHER CASE IN PROVIDING AN AMOUNT WHICH MAY BE MORE OR LESS ADEQUATE AND IN A THIRD CASE IN INCREASING THE EXISTING INEQUALITY A SECOND CRITICISM THAT SHOULD BE NOTED IS THE SCANT CONSIDERATION GIVEN THE MATTER OF FEDERAL SUPPORT OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION BELOW THE COLLEGE LEVEL NO SIGNIFICANT PLACE IS FOUND FOR SUCH TRAINING IN THE GENERAL SCHEME OF MAKING THE SCHOOLS EFFICIENT ON A NATIONWIDE HASIS THE SHORT CHAPTER DEVOTED TO THE QUESTION OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION CONTAINS A SINGLE PARAGRAPH OF GENERAL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE SMITHHUGHES LAW FOLLOWING WHICH AN OUTLINE OF THE MAIN FEATURES OF THIS ACT IS PRESENTED WITHOUT COMMENT THUS BY REFUSING TO RECOGNIZE THE SHORTCOMINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND BY FAILING TO INCORPORATE ALL THE ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS OF EQUALIZED EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY INTO A SCIENTIFICALLY DETERMINED AND COORDINATED SCHEME OF FEDERAL SUPPORT OF PUBLIC EDUCATION THE BOOK IMPRESSES THE READER AS FALLING SHORT OF ITS SPLENDID OPPORTUNITY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ADEQUATE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF MOST IMMEDIATE IMPORTANCE TO THE NATION AND THE SCHOOLS

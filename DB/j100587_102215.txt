DARTIUS HAD NO DESIGN OF PUBLISHING HIS PAPERS OF THIS SUBJECT BUT ONLY TO GRATIFY HIS PHANCY AND THE EX CELLENT SKILL HE HAD IN LIMNING AS APPEARS FROM HIS ALMOST TOTAL NEGLECT OF DESCRIPTIONS WHICH HE HAD SUFFICIENT OP PORTUNITY TO HAVE WELL PERFORMEDBESIDES THE TUMULTUOUS ORDER IN WHICH THEY WERE FIRST PUBLISHED AFTER HIS DEATH SO THAT HE SEEMS RATHER TO HAVE DIVERTED HIMSELF BY CON VERSING

the sale of growing trees evidence that five years after breach the vendor conveyed a portion of the land on which the trees were standing to a third person is irrelevant and should be excluded 2 DAMAGESContract to sell grouing treesBreachMeasure of Damages Grow ing trees are regarded in this State as real estate and in an action by a vendee against his vendor to recover damages for a breach of a contract for the sale and delivery of such trees the measure of damages according to the Virginia doctrine is as a general rule the purchase money actually paid and interest thereon and not the difference between the contract price and the market value at the time of the breach The evidence in the case in judgment does not bring it within either of the exceptions laid down in Wilson v Spencer 11 Leigh 271 Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Russell county ren dered August 10 1900 in an action of assumpsit wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defendant in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case J J Stuart and TV E Burns for the plaintiff in error W W Bird and Henry  Graham for the defendant in error CARDWELL J delivered the opinion of the court This is a writ of error to a judgment in an action of trespass on the case in assumpsit on a contract entered into between plaintiff in error D C Stuart and defendant in error Mrs S P Pennis on the 24th day of December 1892 for the sale and purchase of standing timber at a stipulated price per tree It is the sequel of a suit in equity between the same parties which was twice appealed to this court once in 1895 when it was determined that the grow ing trees constituted a part of the soil and that the contract was for such an interest in land that a bill for its specific enforcement would lie91 Va 688 again in 1899 when the decree of the  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter560 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec Circuit Court dismissing complainants bill upon its merits was affirmed after being amended so as to permit him to bring his action at law upon the contract if he should be so advised 1 Sup Ct Rep 450 Whereupon plaintiff in error instituted this action and his declaration besides the common counts in assumpsit con tains a special count upon the express contract of the parties as follows And for this also that whereas the plaintiff and defendant en tered into a contract which is in the words and figures following towit CONTRAT Bought of Mrs S P Pennis all poplar timber between her residence and Mrm E C Carters and between the Meade road and the Jessees Mill road and running with the top of Copper Ridge and measuring twentyfour inches in diameter inside the jark and up and as much as thirtytwo feet of merchant able timber at three dollars per tree and all other poplar on her place of the same measurements and specifications at two dollars per tree Also white oak ash and cucumber trees on her place of same dimensions at one dollar and fifty cents per tree  All timber is to be free from knots and all other visible defects Three years is the time allowed for removing timber from land One hundred dollars is to be paid January 1 1893 and the remainder to be paid as the timber is taken away The timber is to be inspected and marked as soon as practicable  December 24 1892 And the plaintiff and defendant having entered into signed and delivered each to the other in duplicate the contract as above set out the plaintiff afterwards towit on the second day of January 1893 attempted to inspect and mark the timber sold by said con tract but was prevented and prohibited by the defendant from do ing so And the plaintiff afterwards towit on the 3d day of January 1893 tendered to the defendant the sum of one hundred dollars the amount to be paid to the defendant by the plaintiff under the terms of the contract aforesaid whereupon the defendant refused to receive it or to in any way comply with her said contract Thereupon the plaintiff deposited the said sum in bank to the credit of the defendant and notified her of such deposit The plaintiff further avers that he has at all times been ready and willing to perform said contract and has offered to do all things incumbent upon him by the terms thereof The defendant hath refused and still doth refuse to perform the contract on her1902 STUART V PENNIS 561 part or to do any of the things incumbent upon her to do by the terms thereof to the damage of the plaintiff 2500 And therefore he brings his suit At the trial upon defendant in errors plea of non assumpsit plaintiff in error introduced evidence as to the market value of the timber at the time of the contract and at the date of the breach thereof which evidence upon motion of defendant in error the court excluded on the ground that the contract price was the measure of damages recoverable in the case and not the difference between the contract price and the real value at the date of the contract or the market value at the time of the breach to which ruling plaintiff in error excepted Plaintiff in error also offered in evidence a deed from defendant in error to one Mason dated November 14 1896 conveying a part of the land upon which a portion of the timber referred to in her contract with plaintiff in error of December 24 1892 set out above is located to the introduction of which deed defendant in error ob jected and the objection was sustained and plaintiff in error again excepted These two exceptions are made the grounds respec tively of plaintiff in errors first and second assignments of error and will be considered in inverse order With reference to the second assignment of error it is only necessary to say that as the deed was not executed until nearly five years after the breach of tlle contract sued on it was irrelevant and was therefore properly excluded The subject matter of the contract being real estateStuart v Pennis suprathe general rule pertaining to damages recoverable by a vendee from a vendor on a breach of a contract for the sale and conveyance of real estate or for a breach of a covenant to war rant the title to real estate conveyed is applicable unless the case can be brought within some exception to the general rule In Phomnpson v Gwthrie 9 Leigh 101 following Stout v Jack sonl 2 Rand 132 Threlkeld v Fitzhugh 2 Leigh 489 Mills v Bell 3 Call 320 and the leading English case of Flureau v Thorn hill 2 W Blacks 1078 it is shown that the rule is as applicable to executory contracts as to those executed and that the vendee is not entitled to more damages than the purchase money he has actually paid and interest thereon For this says the opinion he ought to be compensated if the land falls in value and no more than562 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec compensated if it rises Such a rule offers no temptation to the vendor to violate his contract because if he has a good title the vendee can claim specific performance in a court of chancery in stead of bringing his action at law It is true as pointed out in the argument of the case at bar the doctrine announced in Flureau v Thornhill and Thompson v Guthrie has not been uniformly followed in the Supreme Court of the United States and several of the State courts but it has been recognized as a settled doctrine in a number of decisions by this court viz Wilson v Spencer 11 Leigh 271 Newbrough v Walke 8 Gratt 16 Chick v Green 77 Va 835 Sheifey v Gard ner 79 Va 313 Abernathy v Phillips 82 Va 769 Conrad v Elfinger 87 Va 59 and Roller v Effinger 88 Va 641 It is contended however that the rule does not extend to the case of a party who simply refuses to perform his contract in order to secure a more advantageous bargain and Wilson v Spencer supra is relied on as sustaining this view The opinion of the court in that case instead of departing from or qualifying the rule laid down in Thompson v Guthrie supra distinctly recognized it as well established and sustained the ruling of the lower court allowing proof as to the value of the land at the time of the breach upon grounds that do not exist in the case at bar viz First the vendor having title to the land in bad faith disabled himself to perform his contract to convey to his vendee by conveying to an other second the action was upon a bond conditioned to convey a tract of land the breach assigned being a failure to convey and there was no agreed price stated in the bond and third the de fendant instead of objecting to the proof offered by the plaintiff as to the value of the land at the time of the breach entered into the controversy as to the value at that period and offered evidence to reduce the price at that date The elaborate opinion adheres to the rule laid down in Thompson v Guthrie but treats the case then under consideration as coming within an exception to that rule Mr Minor discussing this subject and citing a number of authorities among which are the Virginia cases to which we have referred including Wilson v Spencer supra2 Minors Insts 865 says But nothing can be allowed for the loss of a bargain even though there may have been an actual increase in the market value of the land and much less where the loss is of a purely speculative1902 STUART V PENNIS 563 character as of profits which he the plaintiff might perhaps have realized by advantageous employment of the property or other wise Again on p 866 it is said And it will be observed that for the most part the best standard whereby to determine the value of the land is the purchase money citing among others the case of Wilson v Spencer He then sets out as held in Wilson v Spen cer that an exception to the rule is where the vendors breach of contract results not from his misfortune in proving to be not en titled to land of which he believed himself to be the owner but from his misconduct or from his undue precipitancy as for ex ample where he had subsequently conveyed to another person or where he has entered into a contract to sell before he had himself acquired title to the land Suppose then it were conceded in this case that plaintiff in error under the declaration he has filed had the right to have the evi dence adduced by him to show a purpose on the part of defendant in error in refusing to perform her contract to secure a more ad vantageous bargain considered by the jury was it sufficient to take the case from the control of the general rule we have been dis cussing and bring it within the exception stated by Mr Minor and in Wilson v Spencer We think not The contract sued on states the price of the timber per tree as agreed on between the parties Defendant in error owned the timber and the land upon which it stood when she entered into the contract and still owned both at the time of its alleged breach and the special breach alleged is that plaintiff in error on the 2d day of January 1893 attempted to inspect and mark the timber sold by the said contract but was prevented and prohibited by the defendant from doing so If there be any eviderce in the record from which it might perhaps have been inferred that defendant in error for the purpose of making a more advantageous bargain refused to allow the timber to be inspected and marked it appears in her letter of January 2 1893 introduced in evidence by plaintiff in error addressed to him as Dear Dale in which she says I have decided to ask you to let me out of our timber trade  My neigh bors I hear are selling poplar trees at 5 besides this I need the money for my timber at once You can spend your time as profitably in some other affair and let me keep my timber and get more for it if I can from somebody else  A letter of564 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec later date also introduced by plaintiff in error shows that she thought he had let her off Viewing the case therefore in the light of facts and circum stances surrounding it including those intended to be shown by the evidence ruled out by the learned judge below we see nothing to take the case from the control of the general rule that the measure of damages is the contract price and not the difference between the contract price and the market value of the property at the time of the breach Plaintiff in error having admitted at the trial that he had gotten back the 100 deposited by him in the bank to the credit of de fendant in error and therefore had paid nothing on the contract the verdict of the jury is in accordance with the law and evidence in the case and the judgment is affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe decision in this case that one party to a contract for sale of standing timberheld to be real estate may wilfully violate his contract with out legal cause or excuse and yet be held not liable for damages other than a return of the purchase money with interest will strike many of our readers as a novel and unjust doctrine Before this decision we had supposed the law in Virginia to be as it is in many States that where a vendor contracts in good faith to convey real estate believing that his title is good but without his fault is unable to convey a good title then the measure of damages is merely a return of the purchase money paid with interest But if such a vendor abundantly able to convey title as agreed wilfully and wrongfully refuses to fulfil his contract then the measure of damages is the same as in the case of a contract for the sale of personal property namely the difference between the contract price and the market price But in the principal case the court holds that the law in Virginia as settled by a line of previous well considered cases fixes the measure of damages as the same in both cases and that in neither case is the disappointed vendee entitled to any damages save a return of the purchase money with interest We confess not to have examined all the cases relied upon by the court and are not therefore disposed to deny the correctness of the decision But we protest against any such unjust doctrine being permitted hereafter to govern the rights of a vendee in such case and we express the hope that it may be altered by early legislation Any rule of law that permits one party to a contract deliberately to violate it without excuse to the serious injury of the other and yet successfully resist a judgment for the damages thus suffered is discreditable to an enlightened jurisprudence

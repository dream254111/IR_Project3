AT THE TIME OF THE BREACH TO WHICH RULING PLAINTIFF IN ERROR EXCEPTED PLAINTIFF IN ERROR ALSO OFFERED IN EVIDENCE A DEED FROM DEFENDANT IN ERROR TO ONE MASON DATED NOVEMBER 14 1896 CONVEYING A PART OF THE LAND UPON WHICH A PORTION OF THE TIMBER REFERRED TO IN HER CONTRACT WITH PLAINTIFF IN ERROR OF DECEMBER 24 1892 SET OUT ABOVE IS LOCATED TO THE INTRODUCTION OF WHICH DEED DEFENDANT IN ERROR OB

CONTRACT SUED ON IT WAS IRRELEVANT AND WAS THEREFORE PROPERLY EXCLUDED THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE CONTRACT BEING REAL ESTATESTUART V PENNIS SUPRATHE GENERAL RULE PERTAINING TO DAMAGES RECOVERABLE BY A VENDEE FROM A VENDOR ON A BREACH OF A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE AND CONVEYANCE OF REAL ESTATE OR FOR A BREACH OF A COVENANT TO WAR RANT THE TITLE TO REAL ESTATE CONVEYED IS APPLICABLE UNLESS THE CASE CAN BE BROUGHT WITHIN SOME EXCEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE IN PHOMNPSON V GWTHRIE 9 LEIGH 101 FOLLOWING STOUT V JACK SONL 2 RAND 132 THRELKELD V FITZHUGH 2 LEIGH 489 MILLS V BELL 3 CALL 320 AND THE LEADING ENGLISH CASE OF FLUREAU V THORN HILL 2 W BLACKS 1078 IT IS SHOWN THAT THE RULE IS AS APPLICABLE TO EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AS TO THOSE EXECUTED AND THAT THE VENDEE IS NOT ENTITLED TO MORE DAMAGES THAN THE PURCHASE MONEY HE HAS ACTUALLY PAID AND INTEREST THEREON FOR THIS SAYS THE OPINION HE OUGHT TO BE COMPENSATED IF THE LAND FALLS IN VALUE AND NO MORE THAN562 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC COMPENSATED IF IT RISES SUCH A RULE OFFERS NO TEMPTATION TO THE VENDOR TO VIOLATE HIS CONTRACT BECAUSE IF HE HAS A GOOD TITLE THE VENDEE CAN CLAIM SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE IN A COURT OF CHANCERY IN STEAD OF BRINGING HIS ACTION AT LAW IT IS TRUE AS POINTED OUT IN THE ARGUMENT OF THE CASE AT BAR THE DOCTRINE ANNOUNCED IN FLUREAU V THORNHILL AND THOMPSON V GUTHRIE HAS NOT BEEN UNIFORMLY FOLLOWED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AND SEVERAL OF THE STATE COURTS BUT IT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED AS A SETTLED DOCTRINE IN A NUMBER OF DECISIONS BY THIS COURT VIZ WILSON V SPENCER 11 LEIGH 271 NEWBROUGH V WALKE 8 GRATT 16 CHICK V GREEN 77 VA 835 SHEIFEY V GARD NER 79 VA 313 ABERNATHY V PHILLIPS 82 VA 769 CONRAD V ELFINGER 87 VA 59 AND ROLLER V EFFINGER 88 VA 641 IT IS CONTENDED HOWEVER THAT THE RULE DOES NOT EXTEND TO THE CASE OF A PARTY WHO SIMPLY REFUSES TO PERFORM HIS CONTRACT IN ORDER TO SECURE A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS BARGAIN AND WILSON V SPENCER SUPRA IS RELIED ON AS SUSTAINING THIS VIEW THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN THAT CASE INSTEAD OF DEPARTING FROM OR QUALIFYING THE RULE LAID DOWN IN THOMPSON V GUTHRIE SUPRA DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZED IT AS WELL ESTABLISHED AND SUSTAINED THE RULING OF THE LOWER COURT ALLOWING PROOF AS TO THE VALUE OF THE LAND AT THE TIME OF THE BREACH UPON GROUNDS THAT DO NOT EXIST IN THE CASE AT BAR VIZ FIRST THE VENDOR HAVING TITLE TO THE LAND IN BAD FAITH DISABLED HIMSELF TO PERFORM HIS CONTRACT TO CONVEY TO HIS VENDEE BY CONVEYING TO AN OTHER SECOND THE ACTION WAS UPON A BOND CONDITIONED TO CONVEY A TRACT OF LAND THE BREACH ASSIGNED BEING A FAILURE TO CONVEY AND THERE WAS NO AGREED PRICE STATED IN THE BOND AND THIRD THE DE FENDANT INSTEAD OF OBJECTING TO THE PROOF OFFERED BY THE PLAINTIFF AS TO THE VALUE OF THE LAND AT THE TIME OF THE BREACH ENTERED INTO THE CONTROVERSY AS TO THE VALUE AT THAT PERIOD AND OFFERED EVIDENCE TO REDUCE THE PRICE AT THAT DATE THE ELABORATE OPINION ADHERES TO THE RULE LAID DOWN IN THOMPSON V GUTHRIE BUT TREATS THE CASE THEN UNDER CONSIDERATION AS COMING WITHIN AN EXCEPTION TO THAT RULE MR MINOR DISCUSSING THIS SUBJECT AND CITING A NUMBER OF AUTHORITIES AMONG WHICH ARE THE VIRGINIA CASES TO WHICH WE HAVE REFERRED INCLUDING WILSON V SPENCER SUPRA2 MINORS INSTS 865 SAYS BUT NOTHING CAN BE ALLOWED FOR THE LOSS OF A BARGAIN EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY HAVE BEEN AN ACTUAL INCREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF THE LAND AND MUCH LESS WHERE THE LOSS IS OF A PURELY SPECULATIVE1902 STUART V PENNIS 563 CHARACTER AS OF PROFITS WHICH HE THE PLAINTIFF MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE REALIZED BY ADVANTAGEOUS EMPLOYMENT OF THE PROPERTY OR OTHER WISE AGAIN ON P 866 IT IS SAID AND IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT FOR THE MOST PART THE BEST STANDARD WHEREBY TO DETERMINE THE VALUE OF THE LAND IS THE PURCHASE MONEY CITING AMONG OTHERS THE CASE OF WILSON V SPENCER HE THEN SETS OUT AS HELD IN WILSON V SPEN CER THAT AN EXCEPTION TO THE RULE IS WHERE THE VENDORS BREACH OF CONTRACT RESULTS NOT FROM HIS MISFORTUNE IN PROVING TO BE NOT EN TITLED TO LAND OF WHICH HE BELIEVED HIMSELF TO BE THE OWNER BUT FROM HIS MISCONDUCT OR FROM HIS UNDUE PRECIPITANCY AS FOR EX AMPLE WHERE HE HAD SUBSEQUENTLY CONVEYED TO ANOTHER PERSON OR WHERE HE HAS ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT TO SELL BEFORE HE HAD HIMSELF ACQUIRED TITLE TO THE LAND SUPPOSE THEN IT WERE CONCEDED IN THIS CASE THAT PLAINTIFF IN ERROR UNDER THE DECLARATION HE HAS FILED HAD THE RIGHT TO HAVE THE EVI DENCE ADDUCED BY HIM TO SHOW A PURPOSE ON THE PART OF DEFENDANT IN ERROR IN REFUSING TO PERFORM HER CONTRACT TO SECURE A MORE AD VANTAGEOUS BARGAIN CONSIDERED BY THE JURY WAS IT SUFFICIENT TO TAKE THE CASE FROM THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL RULE WE HAVE BEEN DIS CUSSING AND BRING IT WITHIN THE EXCEPTION STATED BY MR MINOR AND IN WILSON V SPENCER WE THINK NOT THE CONTRACT SUED ON STATES THE PRICE OF THE TIMBER PER TREE AS AGREED ON BETWEEN THE PARTIES DEFENDANT IN ERROR OWNED THE TIMBER AND THE LAND UPON WHICH IT STOOD WHEN SHE ENTERED INTO THE CONTRACT AND STILL OWNED BOTH AT THE TIME OF ITS ALLEGED BREACH AND THE SPECIAL BREACH ALLEGED IS THAT PLAINTIFF IN ERROR ON THE 2D DAY OF JANUARY 1893 ATTEMPTED TO INSPECT AND MARK THE TIMBER SOLD BY THE SAID CONTRACT BUT WAS PREVENTED AND PROHIBITED BY THE DEFENDANT FROM DOING SO IF THERE BE ANY EVIDERCE IN THE RECORD FROM WHICH IT MIGHT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN INFERRED THAT DEFENDANT IN ERROR FOR THE PURPOSE OF MAKING A MORE ADVANTAGEOUS BARGAIN REFUSED TO ALLOW THE TIMBER TO BE INSPECTED AND MARKED IT APPEARS IN HER LETTER OF JANUARY 2 1893 INTRODUCED IN EVIDENCE BY PLAINTIFF IN ERROR ADDRESSED TO HIM AS DEAR DALE IN WHICH SHE SAYS I HAVE DECIDED TO ASK YOU TO LET ME OUT OF OUR TIMBER TRADE  MY NEIGH BORS I HEAR ARE SELLING POPLAR TREES AT 5 BESIDES THIS I NEED THE MONEY FOR MY TIMBER AT ONCE YOU CAN SPEND YOUR TIME AS PROFITABLY IN SOME OTHER AFFAIR AND LET ME KEEP MY TIMBER AND GET MORE FOR IT IF I CAN FROM SOMEBODY ELSE  A LETTER OF564 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC LATER DATE ALSO INTRODUCED BY PLAINTIFF IN ERROR SHOWS THAT SHE THOUGHT HE HAD LET HER OFF VIEWING THE CASE THEREFORE IN THE LIGHT OF FACTS AND CIRCUM STANCES SURROUNDING IT INCLUDING THOSE INTENDED TO BE SHOWN BY THE EVIDENCE RULED OUT BY THE LEARNED JUDGE BELOW WE SEE NOTHING TO TAKE THE CASE FROM THE CONTROL OF THE GENERAL RULE THAT THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS THE CONTRACT PRICE AND NOT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACT PRICE AND THE MARKET VALUE OF THE PROPERTY AT THE TIME OF THE BREACH PLAINTIFF IN ERROR HAVING ADMITTED AT THE TRIAL THAT HE HAD GOTTEN BACK THE 100 DEPOSITED BY HIM IN THE BANK TO THE CREDIT OF DE FENDANT IN ERROR AND THEREFORE HAD PAID NOTHING ON THE CONTRACT THE VERDICT OF THE JURY IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAW AND EVIDENCE IN THE CASE AND THE JUDGMENT IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTETHE DECISION IN THIS CASE THAT ONE PARTY TO A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF STANDING TIMBERHELD TO BE REAL ESTATE MAY WILFULLY VIOLATE HIS CONTRACT WITH OUT LEGAL CAUSE OR EXCUSE AND YET BE HELD NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OTHER THAN A RETURN OF THE PURCHASE MONEY WITH INTEREST WILL STRIKE MANY OF OUR READERS AS A NOVEL AND UNJUST DOCTRINE BEFORE THIS DECISION WE HAD SUPPOSED THE LAW IN VIRGINIA TO BE AS IT IS IN MANY STATES THAT WHERE A VENDOR CONTRACTS IN GOOD FAITH TO CONVEY REAL ESTATE BELIEVING THAT HIS TITLE IS GOOD BUT WITHOUT HIS FAULT IS UNABLE TO CONVEY A GOOD TITLE THEN THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS MERELY A RETURN OF THE PURCHASE MONEY PAID WITH INTEREST BUT IF SUCH A VENDOR ABUNDANTLY ABLE TO CONVEY TITLE AS AGREED WILFULLY AND WRONGFULLY REFUSES TO FULFIL HIS CONTRACT THEN THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES IS THE SAME AS IN THE CASE OF A CONTRACT FOR THE SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY NAMELY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACT PRICE AND THE MARKET PRICE BUT IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE COURT HOLDS THAT THE LAW IN VIRGINIA AS SETTLED BY A LINE OF PREVIOUS WELL CONSIDERED CASES FIXES THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES AS THE SAME IN BOTH CASES AND THAT IN NEITHER CASE IS THE DISAPPOINTED VENDEE ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES SAVE A RETURN OF THE PURCHASE MONEY WITH INTEREST WE CONFESS NOT TO HAVE EXAMINED ALL THE CASES RELIED UPON BY THE COURT AND ARE NOT THEREFORE DISPOSED TO DENY THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DECISION BUT WE PROTEST AGAINST ANY SUCH UNJUST DOCTRINE BEING PERMITTED HEREAFTER TO GOVERN THE RIGHTS OF A VENDEE IN SUCH CASE AND WE EXPRESS THE HOPE THAT IT MAY BE ALTERED BY EARLY LEGISLATION ANY RULE OF LAW THAT PERMITS ONE PARTY TO A CONTRACT DELIBERATELY TO VIOLATE IT WITHOUT EXCUSE TO THE SERIOUS INJURY OF THE OTHER AND YET SUCCESSFULLY RESIST A JUDGMENT FOR THE DAMAGES THUS SUFFERED IS DISCREDITABLE TO AN ENLIGHTENED JURISPRUDENCE

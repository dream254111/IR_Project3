in university circles as in other circumstances of life Probably however it will be a fair approximation to the facts if we esti mate the cost of living in the localities of the United States in which universities most comparable to those of Germany are situated taking all of these variables into account as one and a half times greater than in Germany Compared with other classes in the com munity the German university professor is still better off than his American colleague He ranks financially with very important legal and administrative officers and no principal of a normal school or head of a city system of schools approaches in in come from educational work the income received by a considerable percentage of university professors The German gov ernments pay teachers in the elementary schools well and the teachers in the sec ondary schools especially well but the full professor in a university receives over four times as much as the former and over twice as much as the latter class The financial status of the university professor in Ger many is thus seen to be at the top in the educational world and on a level with all except the nobility and the more successful of business men It is unnecessary to revert to the dissimilar position of the uni versity professor in America And human nature being what it is the higher relative prosperity of the German professor prob ably seems as important to him as his higher absolute prosperity THE OKLAHOMA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THE Oklahoma Geological Survey was established by the act of the first legislature of the state of Oklahoma The sum

Officer War Board for the Port of New York VERYONE has known that freight congestion existed at New York but there has been a general lack of knowledge as to the causes of the congestion and the points at which remedies could be applied If you are to tune up your motor the first thing to determine is what cylinder you are missing on It was with this thought in mind that I determined at the be ginning of the work of the War Board for the Port of New York to spend my time in finding out the fundamental cause of the congestion before attempting to adjust matters of detail such as lighterage and carting problems Information and statistics are being assembled which will be of use later in adjusting details but the starting point must be a knowledge of fundamen tal causes The ocean trade from this port divides itself into three classes First comes ordinary commercial tonnage which is operated for gain by experienced steamship owners and agents I soon deter mined that this class of business was in the hands of experienced men and was being efficiently administered Some improve ments may be made but at the moment it is not the seat of trouble The next class is the Allied tonnage and the mistakes made in conducting this class of business at the beginning of the war were the cause of our first congestion Nearly all purchases for the allies were made f o b New York which made it neces sary for the manufacturers and merchants selling the supplies to get them to this port in order to get their money The sup plies were rushed here far in excess of the ocean tonnage availa ble to carry them abroad The result was that our terminals were clogged not with merchandise passing through them but with shipments which could not be removed from the terminals because ships were not available to carry them The New York terminals were for the moment the stomach of the nation and were asked to digest food which could not be properly carried 1 Introductory address as presiding officer at the afternoon meeting of the Academy of Political Science December I4 I917 756No 4 DEMANDS ON THE PORT OF NEW YORK away The result was a bilious attack of the worst kind If I may use another homely simile the terminals of New York are our vestibule through which everything must pass The vesti bule is designed as a passageway If we turn it into a trunk room and store in it goods which we shall need later on but cannot use at the moment its usefulness as a vestibule ends The result of clogging our terminals was the establishment of many embargoes some of which imposed unjust restrictions on ordinary business and made such business pay the penalty for mistakes made by others When this situation became acute the English government established a traffic board in New York to regulate the shipment of their supplies This board in confer ence with the railroad executives soon determined the trouble and adopted the policy of inspecting and paying for their sup plies at the point of origin and storing them there until they could be brought to New York in time to be ready for a ship to take them overseas The machinery arranged by this board was very simple but effective I will not attempt to describe it in detail but the result has been that overseas supplies for Eng land are not now brought to New York until ships are ready to carry them and our terminals have been freed from that part of the congestion Representatives of the other Allied govern ments were later associated with this traffic board and their shipments have been in a measure regulated in the same way although not yet with complete success These arrangements have made it possible to say that the seat of the present and probable future congestion is not with the movement of freight to the Allies except as to those of them who are not yet operating in complete accord with the system adopted by the English The adoption of the foregoing plan relieved in a large measure the congestion and terminals were in a fair way of being cleared of their undigested freight at the time of the entry of this coun try into the war When we became actively involved large purchases of supplies were made for all of the government de partments interested in overseas operations While in theory these shipments are also held in the interior until vessels are available to carry them abroad in practice enormous quantities of the supplies have moved to the seaboard and are held here awaiting shipment there is grave danger that the congestion which existed at the time of the first large purchases by our allies in this country will be duplicated unless a plan to control the 757 IOIECONOMICS OF WINNING THE WAR movement of government freight is adopted and coordinated with that of the Allies and the freight of ordinary commerce The terminals of New York are capable of handling an enormous export tonnage if they are used as terminals and not as storage yards If they are used for storage purposes and supplies which cannot be transshipped are crowded into them without refer ence to the ships available for transport purposes they will be clogged even though they be doubled in capacity The essential thing is to recognize that they are merely a passageway from land transportation to ocean transportation and that their use must be limited to the accomplishment of this service The American shipments must be held back until ships are available to carry them abroad and it is not enough to regulate the flow of government shipments independently of shipments to our allies and those of ordinary commerce The control of move ment of all exports must in my judgment be placed in the hands of a competent central authority so that the needs of each com ponent part may receive just consideration and the tonnage available may be apportioned to the transport of that part which is most necessary to win the war This means that some central authority must determine during the period when ships are lack ing whether the needs of the Allies of ordinary commerce or of the American forces come first or to what degree each must be supplied If such a board is to be created and efficiently admin istered the terminals in New York even though still susceptible of great improvement are even now capable of carrying their share of the present burden The time will come however when the construction program of the Emergency Fleet Corporation will begin to bring into existence a great new tonnage of ocean freight carriers We must prepare for this if the freight is to be transported If we are to beat the Germans we must meet them on their own ground of preparedness There are four links in the chain of transportation used in getting freight from the interior of this country to the firing line The first is the railroad link which transports the freight to the seaboard and assembles it for shipment The railroad executives are develop ing the capacity of this link by methods of pooling and joint operation which were undreamed of a few years ago The Ship ping Board is arranging for the construction of a great fleet of ocean carriers This forms another link and the third is the construction by the American government of port facilities in 758 VOL VII I02No 4 DEMANDS ON THE PORT OF NEW YORK France and a railroad leading from them to the front This link is under active construction and will be ready when the crisis arrives The fourth link to which little attention has yet been paid is the intermediary link between the railroads and the shipsthe seaport terminals As I have stated these terminals if used for their proper purposes and relieved of burdens which never should be put upon them can take care of the present situation but as additional ships are available and our forces abroad are increased additional port facilities must be provided New York can do only its share The other Atlantic and Gulf ports must do theirs but there will be little use in expending a billion or two billion dollars in constructing ocean carriers and in developing land carriers both in this country and in France to a point where they can take care of any burden placed upon them if no steps are taken to develop what may be the weakest link in the chainthat of our seaport terminals A chain is only as strong as its weakest link and while our terminals may be made to meet present needs by freeing them of unnecessary bur dens they must be developed to a strength equal to the other links if a uniform flow of supplies to our overseas forces and to our allies is to be maintained This is the large problem which beset the chief executive officer of the War Board for the Port of New York To it I have given a great deal of my time because no matter how well the machinery of organization of the war board might be per fected our port would break down under the strain if relief along the lines I have suggested were not secured I believe that we are going to secure this relief I think the army and the railway officials appreciate its seriousness The nature of the problem is better understood today than in the past and I think that the business mans point of view will more and more receive con sideration What I have tried to do is to bring to this task the help of the business man 759 I03

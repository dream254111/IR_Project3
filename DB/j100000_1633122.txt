TYPES OF GENERA IN connection with the discussion on elimination vs first species in determin ing type species may I be permitted to bring forward certain points which seem to me to be worthy of consideration That some authors are decidedly opposed to elimination while others are equally op posed to first species indicates rather strong ly that there are valid objections to both methods or at least that neither method is perfect Whatever our views in the case may be it is a matter of record that some authors have adopted the one method while other authors have adopted the other If a given rule of nomenclature is to com mand the general respect of biologists and not to be subject to change from generation to generation it should be sufficiently just ob jectively to appeal to all persons who are called upon to apply it and who may be tem porarily inconvenienced by its application The question therefore arises whether the  first species rule is so inherently just in principle that it will appeal to systematists to sufficiently convince them of the justice of overturning hundreds or possibly thousands of cases of type determination which have been made since 1758 and especially since 1842 Personally I view the first species rule as one of enormous convenience and as one which can be applied in the vast majority of cases uniformly by all workers That it is necessary however desirable it may be to have a rule which will apply uni formly to all genera is a point which I very seriously doubt On the contrary it seems to me that there is a certain amount of ad vantage in allowing a margin for the exercise of some discretion in certain cases That two authors may arrive at different conclusions on the basis of elimination does not tlherefore seem to me to condemn it146 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 630 My friend Dr Alleni has given Vulttur Lin n11us 1758 as an example of elimination All authors may not agree with him in his method of elimination but I believe I am justified in pointing out that both he and those authors who differ with him as to his method of elimination for two methods are possible in this case have overlooked the very important fact that they have ignored the rule which Linmeus himself laid down for the determination of types of his own genera Now since Linnaeus did give a rule to be applied to his genera it seems to me that it is obligatory to apply that rule to Linnaean genera regardless of our views of first species or of elimination The example upon which the discussion is based is therefore an invalid one from either Dr Allens or Mr Stones point of view A point to which attention may be directed is that not only the elimination rule but the first species rule also is interpreted differently by different men Take the genus Disphara gus Dujardin 1845 for instance If an au thor who does not adopt the rule of type by inclusion were to determine a type for this genus he might select either D decorus or D laticeps or D tenuis as type and yet he would be following the first species rule as interpreted by three different sets of workers It should however be mentioned that if he followed the rule as interpreted by the Amer ican Ornithological Union this difference of opinion would not arise but not all first species men agree with the American Ornith ological Union interpretation Still more important than the foregoing is the fact that the first species rule would in many cases virtually misrepresent an original authors intention in that if the type is de termined on basis of his generic diagnosis and with a number of species from which to select the nature of his genus becomes more or less clear and we have a more or less definite sys tematic unit upon basis of which we can con fidently proceed with further work If how ever the first species rule is made ironclad then not infrequently will the genus be based upon a very imperfectly described species and will thus be more or less obscure hence fur ther systematic work based upon such de termination unnecessarily runs the risk of being only ephemeral in character We would thus make ourselves slaves to a rule of con venience the convenience being judged from only one standpoint rather than make the rules our servants Again in many groups there is an exceed ingly great advantage in taking a figured spe cies as type In view of the possible necessity of a future restudy of the anatomy of the type species in order to determine some point which was not foreseen it is often of great importance to select as type a species which is common and therefore easily obtained Nor should we forget DeCandolles excellent ad vice as to the value of selecting as type a species belonging to a group which contains as large a number of species as possible in order to change as few names as possible These are other points of view in reference to convenience points of view which are im portant not alone to the systematist but also to the morphologist while the first species rule ignores the morphologists entirely In return for ignoring these points the first species rule presents to us one onesided ad vantage It is a rule of conveniencenot of principle and as such it relieves an author from knowing the literature when he attempts systematic work My very esteemed colleague Mr Stone expresses it at least inferentially in another way namely he compares the first species rule to arithmetic hence he argues that any one can use it while the more com plicated methods he compares to higher mathe matics The comparison is an excellent one and I accept it But it may be remarked that the question of type determination is one which involves so many points that it should not be entered into by any person whose edu cation has not extended beyond the arithmetic stage like astronomy it calls for higher mathematics and to my mind the application of the first species rule to type determination will be found when extended to all zoological groups to be about as satisfactory to the sys tematists at large as would arithmetic be as a final mathematical process in the case of astronomyJANUARY 25 19071 SCIENCE 147 I can not therefore see in the first species rule any inherently just principle nor can I see in the processes which it is designed to supplant any corresponding inherently unjust principle which indicates that future genera tions of zoologists would abide by the rule if adopted Accordingly I am unable to view this proposed legislation as advisable All or practically all systematic zoologists recognize that the principle of priority is in herently just It commands respect even though it irritates us occasionally We apply it to generic names without a murmur or at least without murmuring very loud If this principle is just when applied to the generic names why is it not equally just when applied to the generic types In the one case as in the other the author who applies it must know the literature As a matter of fact the status of no generic name is satisfactorily estab lished from the modern point of view until the type is designated But when this type is once designated by any method whatsoever so long as the species selected was an original species valid from the original authors point of view and unreservedly classified in his genus why reopen the question At that date the generic name first complied with all of the formal conditions which can reasonably be demanded of it Why now reverse the decision of the author who took this step even if you or I would have done it in a somewhat different manner If he selected the type on the first species rule or if he did so on some other rule or on no rule at all the point can still be objectively demonstrated that the type was actually designated This point being 6stablished the question should be settled once for all A genus can not have two separate type species if therefore any author has definitely designated a type species for any given genus regardless of his method how can we establish another type species for it To do so by legislation or otherwise is to weaken the very foundation of nomenclature namely the principle of the law of priority The discussion on this very live subject in nomenclature has convinced me more than ever of the justice of a rule to the effect that no new generic name published after a given date say January 1 1908 shall be entitled to consideration unless its author definitely designates a type at the time of its publica tion If American zoologists approve of this proposition several systematists have already signified their approval I am willing to do what I can to have it inserted in the Interna tional Code I believe it would be wiser to make such a rule retroactive namely to date all genera from the time their types were designated than to adopt the first species rule at this late day CH WARDELL STILES WASHINGTON D C

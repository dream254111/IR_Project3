J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107961,SOME ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO IN THE MEDITERRANEAN,I206987,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS IX SOME ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO IN THE MLEDITERRANEAN BY JOHN DAVY MD FRS ASSISTANT INSPECTOR OF ARMY HOSPITALS READ DECEMBER 22 1831 IN THIS COMMUNICATION I SHALL HAVE THE HONOUR OF LAYING BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE INFORMATION I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO COLLECT RESPECTING THE VOLCANO WHICH THREE MONTHS AGO MADE ITS APPEARANCE OFF THE SOUTHERN SHORE OF SICILY THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE OF ITS BREAKING OUT WAS BROUGHT TO MALTA ON THE 16TH OF JULY BY A MERCHANT VESSEL THE MASTER OF WHICH STATED THAT ON THE 13TH OF THAT MONTH WHEN PASSING BETWEEN SICILY AND THE ISLAND PANTALLARIA HE WIT NESSED COLUMNS OF SMOKE RISING FROM THE SEA ACCOMPANIED WITH A GREAT NOISE ABOUT TWENTYFIVE MILES TO THE SOUTHWARD OF SCHIACCA THE CORRECTNESS OF THIS REPORT WAS CONFIRMED BY THAT OF OTHERS AND ALL DOUBTS THAT MIGHT EXIST RE SPECTING THE NATURE OF THE PHENOMENA WERE SOON REMOVED BY THE ARRIVAL IN PORT OF CAPTAIN SWINBURNE COMMANDING HIS MAJESTYS SLOOP RAPID FROM THE INTERESTING STATEMENT OF THIS OFFICER WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE MALTA GAZETTE IT APPEARS THAT ON THE 19TH OF JULY WHEN HE SUCCEEDED IN APPROACHING VERY NEAR THE VOLCANO ITS CRATER WAS RAISED ONLY A FEW FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA THAT IT WAS THEN IN GREAT ACTIVITY EMITTING VAST VOLUMES OF STEAM ASHES AND CINDERS WITHOUT FLAME OR REDHOT MATTER AND THAT THERE WAS A CONSTANT FLUX AND REFLUX OF THE SEA BY A BREACH IN ITS SIDE CAPTAIN SWINBURNE REMARKS THAT WHEN PASSING THE SAME SPOT NEARLY A MONTH BEFORE NAMELY ON THE 28TH OF JUNE SEVERAL SHOCKS OF AN EARTHQUAKE WERE FELT SO THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE CAUSE WHICH PRODUCED THE ERUPTION WAS THEN IN OPERATION MDCCCXXXII 2 IDR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO FROM THE 19TH OF JULY TILL THE 16TH OF AUGUST THE VOLCANO CONTINUED ACTIVE AND WAS GRADUALLY ENLARGED IN ALL ITS DIMENSIONS PARTLY OWING TO THE CURI OSITY OF INDIVIDUALS BUT CHIEFLY TO THE WATCHFUL CARE OF VICEADMIRAL SIR HENRY HOTHAM DURING THIS PERIOD IT WAS ALMOST CONSTANTLY UNDER OBSERVA TION ITS ACTIVITY APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN GREATEST ABOUT THE 7TH OF AUGUST WHEN IT WAS VISITED BY CAPTAIN IRTON OF THE 2ND BATALLION OF THE RIFLE BRIGADE WHO MNADE A VERY SUCCESSFUL SERIES OF SKETCHES AND DRAWINGS EXHIBITING ITS DIFFERENT APPEARANCES BOTH AT REST AND IN ACTION COPIES OF SOME OF WHICH THROUGH HIS KINDNESS ARE ANNEXED AT THIS PERIOD IT EMITTED MORE IGNITED MATTER THAN PREVIOUSLY OR AFTERWARDS BUT EVEN THEN ITS FIRE WAS RARELY DISTINCTLY VISIBLE BY DAY ITS ERUPTIONS IT MAY BE INFERRED CEASED SUDDENLY FOR ON THE NIGHT OF THE 15TH OF AUGUST IT WAS SEEN IN A STATE OF CONSIDERABLE ACTIVITY BY A PARTY OF OFFICERS OF THE 73RD REGIMENT AND TWO DAYS AFTER WHEN VISITED BY ANOTHER PARTY COMPOSED OF OFFICERS OF THE RIFLE BRIGADE IT WAS IN A TRANQUIL STATE EMITTING MERELY STEAM OR AQUEOUS VAPOUR SINCE THAT TIME THERE HAS BEEN NO FRESH ERUPTION WHILST THE ERUPTIONS LASTED THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE FORM AND DIMENSIONS OF THE VOLCANO WERE ALMOST CONSTANTLY VARYING ACCORDING TO THE QUANTITY OF ASHES DISCHARGED AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE EXPLOSIONS WHEN IN A STATE OF REST BETWEEN THE 20TH OF AUGUST AND THE 3RD OF SEPTEMBER DURING A PERIOD OF FINE WEATHER IT WAS CAREFULLY EXAMINED BY CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE RN COMMANDING HIS MAJESTYS BRIG FERRET WHO LANDED ON IT REPEATEDLY AND ASCER TAINED ITS EXACT DIMENSIONS HE HAS BEEN SO OBLIGING AS TO FAVOUR ME WITH A PLAN OF IT TAKEN FROM ACTUAL SURVEY A COPY OF WHICH WITH HIS PERMISSION I SHALL ATTACH PLATES V AND VI ACCORDING TO THIS SURVEY THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE ISLAND WAS ABOUT 3240 FEET AND ITS GREATEST HEIGHT 107 FEET AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CRATER WAS ABOUT 780 FEET IIE FOUND THE SURFACE TOLERABLY COOL AND COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF ASHES AND CINDERS WITHOUT ANY LAVA THE CRATER CONTAINED TURBID SALT WATER OF 200 FAHR FROM WHICH BESIDES AQUEOUS VAPOUR THERE WAS A CONSTANT DISENGAGEMENT OF GAS HE HAD SPECIMENS OF THE ASHES AND SCORIAE COLLECTED AND ALSO OF THE WATER AND GAS WHICH E DID ME THE FAVOUR OF SENDING TO ME ON HIS ARRIVAL AT MALTA AND WHICH I SHALL REVERT TO HEREAFTER AS FAR AS THE SOUNDINGLEAD COULD BE THROWN INTO THE CRATER THE WATER WAS VERY SHALLOW NOT EXCEEDING THREE OR FOUR FEET AND THE CRATER WAS EVIDENTLY FILLING UP RAPIDLY BY THE FALLING IN OF ITS MARGIN 238TPHIL TRAIS 42 44 42 6  S 20 40 65 42 F4 40 20 I I 6 222 S 4 I I  I   A I I I 1I II L L F  IE I T44 7 7  R 11 7 V17 717 I 48 I IT F IL TRMNS MD CCCXXII I AE FO 338 ZA 37S

BEARAMJIN E1 DI7 TNY 2 MFI    IL      I IN THE MEDITERRANEAN THIS IS A VERY BRIEF SKETCH OF THE PROGRESS AND PRESENT STATE OF THE VOLCANO FROM ITS COMMENCEMENT TILL NOW I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN THAT ANY THING REMARKABLE HAS OCCURRED IN THE ADJOINING VOLCANIC REGIONS AT SCHIACCA IT WAS STATED THAT THE HOT SULPHUREOUS SPRINGS AT ONE TIME HAD BECOME COLD AND AT ANOTHER HAD CEASED TO FLOW BUT I BELIEVE THIS WAS MERELY IDLE RUMOUR THE TRUTH OF IT HAS BEEN DENIED BY PERSONS WHO HAD OPPORTUNITIES OF BEING ACCU RATELY INFORMED IT WAS ALSO STATED THAT AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE APPEAR ANCE OF THE VOLCANO ETNA WAS MORE ACTIVE THAN USUAL AND THAT SEVERE EARTH QUAKES WERE FELT AT CATANIA THE OCCURRENCE OF SHOCKS OF EARTHQUAKES HAS BEEN CONFIRMED BUT NOT THE INCREASED ACTIVITY OF THE MOUNTAIN ON THE CON TRARY I HAVE BEEN ASSURED THAT IT THEN EMITTED LESS THAN ITS ORDINARY QUANTITY OF SMOKE THE VOLCANO OF STROMBOLI I HAVE BEEN INFORMED EXHIBITED ITS USUAL APPEARANCE AND NOTHING UNCOMMON IS REPORTED TO HAVE OCCURRED IN ANY OTHER OF THE LIPARI ISLANDS REFLECTING ON THE PECULIAR SITUATION OF THE NEW VOLCANO MANY MILES DISTANT FROM LAND AND RISING OUT OF A COMPARATIVELY DEEP SEA I INDULGED IN THE HOPE THAT BY A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PHENOMENA OF ITS ERUPTION SOME INFORMA TION OF A SATISFACTORY KIND EITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE MIGHT BE OBTAINED RE SPECTING THE CAUSE TO WHICH IT OWED ITS ORIGIN AND RESPECTING THE CAUSES OF VOLCANOS GENERALLY I SHALL NOW GIVE THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I MADE WITH THIS OBJECT IN VIEW ON THE 5TH OF AUGUST WHEN THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE I VISITED THE VOLCANO IN THE VESSEL UNDER HIS COMMAND THE VOLCANO THAT DAY WAS IN A STATE FAVOURABLE FOR THE PURPOSE IT WAS RATHER MORE ACTIVE THAN USUAL DENSE WHITE VAPOUR WAS CONSTANTLY RISING FROM IT AND AT UNCERTAIN PERIODS ABOUT EVERY TWO OR THREE HOURS EXPLOSIONS TOOK PLACE AND IMMENSE VOLUMES OF WHITE VAPOUR MIXED WITH AND SOMETIMES OBSCURED BY ASHES AND CINDERS WERE THROWN OUT AND PROJECTED TO A GREAT HEIGHT BUT WITHOUT ANY APPEARANCE OF FIRE TO OBSERVE THE PHENOMENA MORE CLOSELY WE QUITTED THE BRIG WHICH LAYTO ABOUT TWO OR THREE MILES OFF AND PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE VOLCANO IN A BOAT THIS WAS ABOUT TEN OCLOCK AM WHEN THE VOLCANO WAS MOST ACTIVE WE FIRST APPROACHED IT TO WINDWARD TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING NARROWLY THE APPEARANCES THE WIND BEING FRESH THE ASHES AND CINDERS FELL PRINCIPALLY ON 2 2 239DR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO THE OTHER SIDE IN WHICH DIRECTION THE SMOKE AND VAPOUR WERE DRIVEN THE SEA WITHIN TWO OR THREE HUNDRED YARDS OF THE VOLCANO WAS CLEAR AND TRANS PARENT AND OF THE USUAL DARK BLUE OF THE MEDITERRANEAN NOWHERE COULD I OBSERVE ANY ASCENT OR BUBBLING OF GAS IN THE WATER NOR DID WE FEEL ANY SHOCK OR COMMOTION WHEN ERUPTIONS TOOK PLACE THE APPEARANCES OF THE ERUPTIONS WERE ALMOST CONSTANTLY VARYING ACCORDING TO THE NATURE AND QUAN TITY OF THE MATTERS THROWN OUT THE MOST COMMON APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF DENSE WHITE VAPOUR RESEMBLING SNOW OR BLEACHED WOOL WHICH THROWN UP IN CONTINUOUS MASSES ROSE TO A GREAT HEIGHT AND ASSUMED VARIOUS EXTRAORDINARY FORMS THIS EFFECT IN ALL PROBABILITY WAS CHIEFLY OWING TO THE VAPOUR OF WATER AT FIRST FROM ITS GREAT DENSITY I WAS DISPOSED TO BELIEVE THAT THE VAPOUR MIGHT CONTAIN MURIATIC ACID OR MURIATE OF AMMONIA OR THE HYDRATED BORACIC OR FLUOBORACIC ACID BUT NONE OF THE PRODUCTS WHICH I AFTERWARDS EXAMINED WERE FAVOURABLE TO THIS IDEA WHEN I WATCHED CAREFULLY A CLOUD OF THIS VAPOUR FLOATING BEFORE THE WIND IT GRADUALLY DISSOLVED AND AT LAST EN TIRELY DISAPPEARED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A VERY FAINT JUST PERCEPTIBLE GRAY VESTIGE WHICH WAS PROBABLY VERY FINE DUST AND PERHAPS SALINE MATTER DERIVED FROM SALT WATER WHEN THE ERUPTIONS WERE MOST VIOLENT THE WHITE VAPOUR WAS FOLLOWED BY COLUMNS OF PERFECTLY BLACK MATTER WHICH SOMETIMES ROSE TO THE HEIGHT OF PERHAPS THREE OR FOUR THOUSAND FEET AND SPREAD OUT VERY WIDELY EVEN TO WINDWARD ONCE OR TWICE THERE WAS AN APPEARANCE OF LURID FIRE WHEN THE ERUPTIONS WERE OF MODERATE STRENGTH THE COLUMNS OF BLACK OR BROWN MATTER INTERMIXING WITH THE MASSES OF WHITE VAPOUR OR ASCENDING THROUGH THEM PRODUCED APPEARANCES VERY NOVEL AND IMPRESSIVE THE SOUNDS ATTEND ING THE ERUPTIONS WERE NOT VERY LOUD THEY RESEMBLED MORE THE RUMBLING OF HEAVY CARRIAGES ON A PAVEMENT THAN THE REPORTS OF EXPLOSIONS THE THUNDER PRODUCED BY THE LIGHTNING WHICH WAS ALMOST CONSTANTLY DARTING IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS IN THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE ERUPTION MUCH EXCEEDED THE SUBTERRANEOUS SOUNDS IN INTENSITY I WATCHED WHEN THE LIGHTNING WAS MOST VIVID AND THE ERUPTION OF THE GREATEST DEGREE OF VIOLENCE TO SEE IF THERE WAS ANY INFLAMMA TION OCCASIONED BY THIS NATURAL ELECTRIC SPARKANY INDICATION OF THE PRESENCE OF INFLAMMABLE GAS BUT IN VAIN HAVING SATISFIED OUR CURIOSITY ON THIS SIDE WE PROCEEDED TOWARDS THE OTHER SKIRTING THE MARGIN OF THE DENSE CLOUDS OF VAPOUR AND ASHES WHICH DESCENDED 240IN THE MEDITERRANEAN AND SPREAD OVER THE SURFACE OF THE SEA IN PASSING WE SAW THE BREACH THROUGH WHICH THERE APPEARED TO BE A CURRENT CONSTANTLY SETTING INTO THE CRATER AND THE WATER ON THE OUTSIDE IN AN APPARENT STATE OF EBULLITION TO LEEWARD THE SEA WAS VERY MUCH DISCOLOURED AND RENDERED TURBID BY ASHES AND DUST AND CINDERS IN PLENTY OF A VERY LIGHT KIND WERE FLOATING ON THE SURFACE TO ASCERTAIN IF THERE WAS ANY PECULIAR SMELL BELONGING TO THE ERUPTION WE PASSED A LITTLE WITHIN THE SKIRTS OF THE CLOUD AND THE WIND THEN FRESHENING WE FOUND OUR SELVES IN THE MIDST OF A DARK SHOWER OF ASHES WHICH FELL WITH THE FORCE OF FINE HAIL COVERED OUR PERSONS AND ALMOST BLINDED US IT WAS NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE HEATED INDEED THE WIND THAT BROUGHT IT AND WHICH APPEARED TO COME FROM THE ATMOSPHERE OF THE VOLCANO WAS UNUSUALLY COOL THE DUST WAS QUITE DRY AND SOME THAT COLLECTED ON THE FOLDS OF OUR DRESS HAD A STRONG SALINE TASTE I SHALL REVERT TO IT AGAIN IN CONSIDERING THE CHEMICAL NATURE OF THE PRO DUCTS EXCEPTING ONCE OR TWICE WHEN WE PERCEIVED A SLIGHT SMELL OF SULPHUR NO UNUSUAL ODOUR NOT THE SLIGHTEST BITUMINOUS SMELL OR SMELL OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN OR OF SULPHUROUS ACID OR OF ANY OTHER ACID FUME WAS OBSERVABLE SHORTLY AFTER WE HAD PULLED OUT OF THIS CLOUD THE VOLCANO BECAME QUIET AND THE WIND DISPERSING THE VAPOUR THE ISLAND APPEARED UNOBSCURED WE WERE SO NEAR TO IT THAT IT APPEARED PRACTICABLE TO REACH IT AND PROCURE SONME SPECIMENS OF THE MATTER OF WHICH IT WAS COMPOSED WHEN WE WERE WITHIN ABOUT A BOATS LENGTH OF ITS PRECIPITOUS SHORE CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE ORDERED SOUNDINGS TO BE TAKEN AND IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DEPTH OF THE WATER WAS EIGHT FATHOMS WLLILST PART OF THE BOATS CREW WERE ENGAGED IN PULLING IN THE LEAD WE HAD WARNING OF AN ERUPTION BY A RUMBLING SUBTERRANEOUS SOUND IM MEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY THE PROJECTION OF A COLUMN OF VAPOUR AND WHICH IN A FEW SECONDS WAS SUCCEEDED BY AN ERUPTION OF ASHES AND CINDERS THE LARGER AND HEAVIER MASSES PASSED OVER US AND FELL AT A DISTANCE FOR ABOUT HALF A MINUTE WE WERE NEARLY IN COMPLETE DARKNESS OWING TO THE THICKNESS OF THE DUST AND ASHES EJECTED I HELD MY BREATH AS LONG AS POSSIBLE NOT EXPECTING THAT THE VAPOUR WOULD HAVE BEEN RESPIRABLE BUT WHEN OBLIGED TO BREATHE I FOUND NO INCONVENIENCE FROM IT NOR DID CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE OR ANY OF THE BOATS CREW FOR A MOMENT I FELT A HOT BLAST BUT THIS WAS VERY PARTIAL AND WAS NOT PERCEIVED BY ANY ONE ELSE IN THE BOAT THERE WAS NO UNPLEASANT SMELL OR ACID FUME OF ANY KIND THE ERUPTION WAS SLIGHT AND OF SHORT DURATION 241DR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO IN A FEW MINUTES THE VAPOUR WAS DISPERSED BY THE WIND SO THAT WE WERE ABLE TO SEE AND HASTEN TO A DISTANCE WE FOUND OURSELVES COMPLETELY WETTED WITH SALT VAPOUR OR SPRAY AND COVERED WITH WET ASHES OF WHICH I HAD NO DIFFICULTY IN COLLECTING A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY FOR EXAMINATION AFTER THIS WE RETURNED ON BOARD BOTH IN COMING FROM THE BRIG AND NEARING THE VOLCANO AND IN RETURNING I PAID ATTENTION TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SEA AND ASCERTAINED IT BY THE THERMO METER AT 10 AM WHEN WE ENTERED THE BOAT AT THE DISTANCE OF TWO OR THREE MILES FROM THE VOLCANO THE SEA ATHE SURFACE WAS 80 WHICH IS ABOUT THE AVE RAGE TEMPERATURE OF THIS PART OF THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MONTH OF AUGUST TO WINDWARD AS WE APPROACHED THE VOLCANO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE SURFACE VARIED FROM 79 TO 78 TO LEEWARD IT WAS LOWER WHEN WITHIN ABOUT TWENTY YARDS OF THE VOLCANO IT FELL TO 70 AND WHEN NEAREST WITHIN SIX OR EIGHT YARDS IT WAS 72 ON LEAVING IT THE TEMPERATURE GRADUALLY ROSE WHEN ABOUT A MILE FROM IT TO LEEWARD AND STILL IN TURBID WATER IT WAS 76 A LITTLE BEYOND THIS THE WATER SUDDENLY BECAME CLEAR AND THE THERMOMETER IMMERSED IN IT ROSE TO 79 THIS LOW TEMPERATURE OF THE WATER CLOSE TO AN ACTIVE VOLCANO IS NOT WHAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED AT FIRST AND IT APPEARS PARADOXICAL IT IS PROBABLY OWING TO OE OR BOTH OF TWO TINGS EITHER TO THE FALL OF CINDERS AND ASHES INTO THE SEA PROJECTED SO HIGH AS TO BE COOLED IN THEIR ASCENT BRINGING DOWN WITH THEM THE LOW TEMPERATURE OF THE UPPER AIR OR TO THE CONCUSSIONS FROM THE ERUPTIONS THROWING UP COLD WATER FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA THIS LATTER SUPPOSITION IS SO MUCH THE MORE PROBABLE AS THERE WAS A PRETTY RAPID CURRENT FLOWING BY THE ISLAND AT THE TIME THE NECESSARY EFFECT OF WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN TO PREVENT THE ACCUMULATION OF HEAT THE WHOLE OF THE NIGHT OF THE 5TH WE REMAINED OFF THE VOLCANO AND IN THE EVENING AND THE EARLY PART OF THE NIGHT WE WITNESSED SOME CONSIDERABLE ERUP TIONS THE REPORTS ATTENDING THEM WERE MUCH LOUDER THAN IN THE MORNING SOME OF THEM RESEMBLING THE REPORTS OF HEAVY ARTILLERY AND OTHERS THE DIS CHARGE OF MUSKETS THESE LATTER WERE SOLITARY AND OCCURRED AT INTERVALS THE FIRE WAS VERY DISTINCT IN THE DARKNESS BUT EVEN WHEN BRIGHTEST THE ASHES AND CINDERS THROWN UP SELDOM EXCEEDED A DULL RED HEAT TWICE OR THRICE I SAW SMALL MASSES SHOOT UP OF A GLOWING WHITE HEAT BUT I WAS DOUBTFUL AT THE MOMENT WHETHER THE EFFECT WAS FROM ELECTRICAL LIGHT OR IGNITED MATTER AS 242IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE MORNING I WATCHED CAREFULLY FOR THE APPEARANCE OF FLAME BUT COULD NOT DETECT IT THE LIGHTNING TRAVERSED IN VARIOUS DIRECTIONS THE VOLCANIC ATMOSPHERE BUT IT WAS NEVER ACCOMPANIED BY ANY APPEARANCE OF THE EXPLOSION OF INFLAM MABLE GASES THE RESULTS OF THE PRECEDING OBSERVATIONS ARE ALL OF A NEGATIVE KIND STILL HOPING TO ASCERTAIN SOMETHING POSITIVE RELATIVE TO THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENA AFTER MY RETURN I AVAILED MYSELF OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING THE PRO DUCTIONS OF THE VOLCANO AND THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF SEVERAL FRIENDS I HAVE BEEN LIBERALLY SUPPLIED WITH MATERIALS THE SOLID PRODUCTS OR MATTERS EJECTED WHICH I HAVE EXAMINED HAVE APPEARED TO DIFFER MORE IN FORM THAN IN CHEMICAL COMPOSITION THEY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE FORM OF FINE SAND OR ASHES OF VERY POROUS LIGHT CINDERS OF COMPARATIVELY HEAVY AND COMPACT CINDERS AND OF FRAGMENTS OF VESICULAR LAVA OF THE LAST VARIETY OF PRODUCT I HAVE SEEN ONLY TWO SMALL SPECIMENS WHICH WERE TAKEN FROM THE CRATER ON THE 2ND OF AUGUST BY CAPTAIN SENHOUSE RN WHO WAS THE FIRST WHO SUCCEEDED IN LANDING ON IT AND WHO HAS PROPOSED FOR IT THE NAME OF GRAHAM ISLAND BOTH THESE MASSES WERE OF A DARK GRAY COLOUR CONTAINED AUGITE AND VERY MUCH RESEMBLED VESICULAR BASALT OR THE COMMON LAVA OF ETNA AND VESUVIUS SUCH AS IS QUARRIED AT PORTICI AND AT CATANIA THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF ONE OF THEM WAS 207 THAT OF THE OTHER WHICH WAS MORE COMPACT 270 THE VERY LIGHT SPONGY CINDER WHICH ABOUNDED FLOATING ON THE SEA VARIED IN COLOUR BETWEEN BLACK AND GRAY REDUCED TO FINE POWDER BY TRI TURATION AND THE GREATER PART OF THE ENTANGLED AIR GOT RID OF IT SUNK IN WATER AND WAS FOUND TO BE OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 264 THE FINE SAND OR ASHES WHICH FELL IN OUR BOAT WHEN WE WERE IN A SHOWER OF IT WAS OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 266 AND SOME WHICH FELL ON US IN THE ERUPTION CLOSE TO THE VOLCANO 275 THE CINDERS OF WHICH THE CRATER APPEARS PRINCIPALLY TO CONSIST ARE COMMONLY OF A DARK COLOUR AND ALMOST BLACK AND THEY ARE GENERALLY VERY POROUS OR SPONGY OCCASIONALLY THEY ARE COLOURED SUPERFICIALLY BY YELLOW OCHRE OR A CRUST OF CLAY MIXED WITH A LITTLE PEROXIDE OF IRON ONE SPECIMEN REDUCED TO POWDER WAS OF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY 274 EVERY SPECIMEN OF SOLID MATTER THAT I HAVE EXAMINED HAS CONTAINED SALINE MATTER SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE SEA AND A SLIGHT TRACE OF SULPHUR IN EVERY SPE CIMEN TRIED REDUCED TO FINE POWDER THERE WERE PARTICLES WHICH WERE ATTRACTED 243DR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO BY THE MAGNET NONE EFFERVESCED WITH ACIDS ALL WERE READILY FUSIBLE BE FORE THE BLOWPIPE AND RAN INTO A BLACK OR DARK GREEN GLASS I COULD NOT DETECT IN ANY OF THEM THE SMALLEST TRACE OF CARBONACEOUS MATTER OR ANY FREE ACID OR ALKALI OR UNCOMBINED ALKALINE EARTH FROM EXPERIMENTS WHICH I MADE ON SMALL PORTIONS OF EACH KIND THEY ALL APPEARED TO CONSIST OF ALUMINE LIME MAG NESIA AND SILEX COLOURED BY PROTOXIDE OF IRON AND WITHOUT ANY POTASH THE ABSENCE OF CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE WAS VERY REMARKABLE IN ALL OF THEM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SMALL MASSES ALREADY ALLUDED TO OF VESICULAR LAVA  I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED THAT I WAS INDEBTED TO CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE FOR A SPECIMEN OF THE WATER OF THE CRATER TAKEN UP SOON AFTER IT HAD BECOME TRANQUIL AND WHEN ITS TEMPERATURE WAS 200 HE FURNISHED ME WITH THREE WINEBOTTLES FULLONE OF THEM FROM THAT PART OF THE CRATER WHICH WAS ALMOST SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN CRATER BY A BAR OF CINDERS AND WAS CALLED THE  SMALL CRATER AND TWO FROM THE MAIN CRATER THEY WERE WELL SECURED WITH CORKS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE WATER FROM THE  SMALL CRATER WAS 1057 THAT OF ONE FROM THE MAIN CRATER WAS 1069 AND THAT OF THE OTHER 1P070 IN PRO PERTIES AND COMPOSITION THEY APPEARED TO BE VERY SIMILAR THEY WERE FREE FROM ANY ODOUR OF A DIRTY FAWN COLOUR FROM A FINE DUST WHICH WAS SUSPENDED IN THEM AND WHICH ON REST SUBSIDED AFTER WHICH THEY BECAME PERFECTLY CLEAR AND COLOURLESS THE SEDIMENT OBTAINED BY FILTERING THE WATER FROM THE MAIN CRATER ABOUT THREE PINTS WEIGHED THIRTY GRAINS IT CONSISTED OF A LIGHT BROWN OCHREY POW  SINCE WRITING THE ABOVE I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY CAPTAIN SENHOUSE WITH FOUR SPECIMENS OF ROCK EJECTED BY THE VOLCANO WHICH FROM THEIR NATURE IT MAY BE INFERRED WERE THROWN UP FROM THE BED OF THE SEA THREE OF THESE ARE WATERWORN PEBBLES DIFFERENT VARIETIES OF LIMESTONE ONE OF THEM IS HIGHLY CRYSTALLINE DOLOMITE CONTAINING A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF MAGNESIA ANOTHER IS FINELY CRYSTAL LINE AND CONTAINS A SMALLER PROPORTION OF MAGNESIA AND THE THIRD IS OF VERY FINE GRAIN NOT CRYSTALLINE WITH ONLY A TRACE OF MAGNESIA THE FOURTH SPECIMEN WHICH IS A FRAGMENT OF A MASS SAID TO HAVE BEEN OF SEVERAL POUNDS WEIGHT HAS A GOOD DEAL OF THE CHARACTER OF GRAYWACKE IT CONTAINS DISSEMINATED THROUGH IT IN A SOLID STATE SALINE MATTER CHIEFLY COMMON SALT IT EFFERVESCES WITH ACIDS AND GELATI NIZES FROM THE FEW EXPERIMENTS I HAVE MADE ON IT IT APPEARS TO BE COMPOSED OF A LARGE PROPORTION OF SILICA AND OF LIME MAGNESIA AND ALUMINE IN ABOUT EQUAL PROPORTIONS AND TO BE COLOURED BY PROT OXIDE OF IRON WHETHER IT CONTAINS ANY LIME OR MAGNESIA NOT COMBINED WITH CARBONIC ACID I HAVE NOT ASCERTAINED IT IS OF CONSIDERABLE HARDNESS AND TOUGHNESS AND IS INFUSIBLE BEFORE THE BLOWPIPE POR TIONS OF ITS SURFACE ARE COVERED WITH A VITREOUS FUSIBLE SCORIA SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE VOLCANO AS IF IT HAD PASSED THROUGH OR COME IN CONTACT WITH THE FUSED MATTER OF THE VOLCANO 244IN THE MEDITERRANEAN DER OF A FINE BLACKISH DUST AND OF FIBRES IN APPEARANCE NOT UNLIKE VEGETABLE FIBRES NO CARBONATE OR SULPHATE OF LIME COULD BE DETECTED IN IT AND ONLY A VERY SLIGHT TRACE OF SULPHUR THE DUST AND POWDER WERE VERY FINE VOLCANIC DUST THE BLACK AS EJECTED  THE YELLOWISH BROWN COLOURED BY PEROXIDE OF IRON INSTEAD OF THE PROTOXIDE PROBABLY FROM THE ACTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE LATTER THE FIBRES RESEMBLING VEGETABLE FIBRES CONSUMED BEFORE THE BLOWPIPE WITH A SMELL VERY LIKE THAT OF SEAWEED BURNING AND IT MAY BE CONJECTURED THAT THEY WERE DERIVED FROM SEAWEED DRAWN INTO THE CRATER THE SAME KIND OF FIBRES IT MAY BE REMARKED WERE FREQUENTLY TO BE SEEN ON SPECIMENS OF CINDERS BROUGHT FROM THE VOLCANO AND THEIR ORIGIN IT MAY BE SUPPOSED WAS THE SAME THE WATER FROM THE  SMALL CRATER AFTER THE SEPARATION OF ITS SEDIMENT EVA PORATED TO DRYNESS WITH GREAT CARE OVER BOILING WATER AFFORDED 86 PER CENT SALINE MATTER THE WATER FROM THE MAIN CRATER THE TWO BOTTLES MIXED SIMI LARLY TREATED AFFORDED 106 PER CENT FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE ON THESE SPECIMENS OF WATER THEY APPEAR TO DIFFER CHIEFLY FROM THE WATER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN NOT IN THEIR PRIN CIPAL SALINE INGREDIENTS BUT IN CONTAINING MORE SULPHATE OF LIME AND A LITTLE ALUMINE OXIDE OF IRON AND A TRACE OF OXIDE OF MANGANESE ALL THREE IN COMBI NATION WITH AN ACID PROBABLY THE SULPHURIC AND MURIATICAND A NOTABLE POR TION OF HYPOSULPHITE OF LIME AND MAGNESIA I COULD NOT DETECT IN EITHER OF THEM ANY FREE ACID OR ALKALI OR THE PRESENCE EVEN IN COMBINATION OF ANY POTASH AMMONIA OR NITRIC ACID NOR THE SLIGHTEST TRACE OF BROMINE OR IODINE IN QUEST OF THESE LATTER SUBSTANCES 77 CUBIC INCHES OF THE WATER FROM THE MAIN CRATER WERE CAREFULLY EVAPORATED AND THE GREATER PART OF THE WHOLE FROM THE 6 SMALL CRATER AND THE MOST APPROVED TESTS AS RECOMMENDED BY M BALARD WERE APPLIED TO THE DELIQUESCENT SALTS EXTRACTED BY ALCOHOL WITHOUT THE SLIGHT EST INDICATION APPEARING OF EITHER OF THEM A SOLUTION OF CHLORINE VERY CAREFULLY DROPPED INTO THE CONCENTRATED SALINE SOLUTION OCCASIONED NO DISCOLORATION AND THE STARCH SOLUTION DID NOT PRODUCE ANY TINT OF BLUE WHETHER THE CHLORINE WAS USED ALONE OR ADDED TO THE SALT WITH EXCESS OF SULPHURIC ACID FOR COMPARISON I TOOK UP FROM THE SEA IN RETURNING FROM THE VOLCANO SIX DIFFERENT SPECIMENS OF THE WATER OF THE MEDITERRANEAN NO 1 WAS TAKEN UP ABOUT FORTY YARDS FROM THE VOLCANO AND WAS SLIGHTLY TURBID NO 2 ABOUT THREE MILES FROM IT WHERE THE SEA WAS CLEAR NO 3 ABOUT FIVE MILES DISTANT IDCCCXXXII 2 K 245DR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO NO 4 ABOUT THREE MILES FROM CAPE BIANCO IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF GIRGENTI NO 5 BETWEEN GIRGENTI AND GOZO IN LAT 36 33 LONG 13 31 AND NO 6 ABOUT A MILE OFF GOZO I ASCERTAINED THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY WITH GREAT CARE BY MEANS OF A DELICATE BALANCE OF ROBINSONS AND FOUND IT THE SAME IN EACH IN STANCE VIZ 10287 WATER AT 750 FAHR BEING 10000 WHICH IS ABOUT THE AVE IRAGE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE SURFACE WATER OF THE OPEN PARTS OF THE MEDITERRANEAN IN THE SUMMER SEASON  I ASCERTAINED ALSO WITH CARE THE SALINE RESIDUE WHICH EACH SPECIMEN AFFORDED EVAPORATED OVER BOILING WATER AND EXPOSED TO THIS TEM PERATURE AS LONG AS ANY LOSS WAS SUSTAINED THE EVAPORATION WAS MADE IN A SILVER CAPSULE WHICH WAS WEIGHED AS SPEEDILY AS POSSIBLE AND WHILST STILL WARM THE RESIDUE PER CENT OF EACH WAS AS FOLLOWS NO 1     446 2     443 3    440 4    439 5  443 6           433 EVEN THESE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES OF THE QUANTITY OF SALINE RESIDUE MIGHT HAVE BEEN AND PROBABLY WERE OWING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MANIPULATION AND THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN RELATION TO HUMIDITY WHEN THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE IN ALL OF THEM WERE DISCOVERABLE A SLIGHT TRACE OF SULPHUR AND AN EXTREMELY MINUTE QUANTITY OF IODINE THE APPARENT ABSENCE OF THE LATTER SUBSTANCE IN THE WATER OF THE CRATER MIGHT EITHER HAVE BEEN OWING TO THE HIGH TEMPERATURE TO WHICH IT HAD BEEN EXPOSED AND TO WHICH ITS SUPERIOR SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS TO BE ATTRIBUTED OR TO THE PRESENCE OF THE HYPOSULPHITES WHICH PERHAPS MIGHT HAVE MASKED SUCH A VERY MINUTE QUANTITY IF PRESENT I HAVE NOW MENTIONED ALL THE PRODUCTS OF THE VOLCANO THAT HAVE COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE EXCEPTING THE GASEOUS THE SPECIMENS OF GAS TWO IN NUMBER WHICH I RECEIVED FROM CAPTAIN WODEHOUSE WERE IN THE WINEBOTTLES IN WHICH THEY HAD BEEN COLLECTED ONE WAS FULL OF AIR THE OTHER CONTAINED ABOUT FOUR FIFTHS AIR AND ONE FIFTH TURBID WATER OF THE VOLCANO THEY HAD MERELY BEEN  IN BAYS IN WHICH NO RIVERS EMPTY THEMSELVES I HAVE FOUND THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE WATER HIGHER AND TOWARDS THE EMBOUCHURES OF GREAT RIVERS LOWER AS IN THE ADRIATIC AND THE HELLESPONT 246IN THE MEDITERRANEAN CORKED AND HAD NOT BEEN PRESERVED WITH ANY OF THE PRECAUTIONS REQUISITE TO HAVE PREVENTED THE ESCAPE OF SOME OF THEIR GASEOUS CONTENTS AND THE ADMISSION OF ATMOSPHERIC AIR AS SOON AS I RECEIVED THEM IT WAS AT NIGHT THEY WERE INVERTED IN WATER AND THE FOLLOWING MORNING THEY WERE EXAMINED IN THE FIRSTMENTIONED BOTTLE WHICH HAD BEEN FULL OF AIR A LITTLE WATER HAD ENTERED SO AS TO FILL ABOUT HALF ITS NECK ON WITHDRAWING THE CORK UNDER WATER WATER RUSHED IN EQUAL TO ABOUT ONE QUARTER OF THE CAPACITY OF THE BOTTLE THE AIR REMAINING HAD A SLIGHT SMELL OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN IT EXTINGUISHED A TAPER PLUNGED INTO IT AND WAS NOT ITSELF INFLAMMABLE 50 MEASURES OF IT BY LIME WATER WERE REDUCED TO 16 AND THESE BY PHOSPHORUS WERE REDUCED TO 13 SULPHUR SUBLIMED IN THIS RESIDUE OCCASIONED NO ALTERATION OF VOLUME THE AIR IN THE OTHER BOTTLE CONTAINING SOME WATER HAD NO SMELL OF SULPHU RETTED HYDROGEN 48 MEASURES OF IT BY LIMEWATER WERE REDUCED TO 33 AND THESE BY PHOSPHORUS TO 31 AND THIS RESIDUE WAS NOT INFLAMMABLE AND EXTIN GUISHED FLAME FROM THESE RESULTS IT MAY BE INFERRED THAT THE GAS IN THE FIRSTMENTIONED BOTTLE CONSISTED CHIEFLY OF CARBONIC ACID AND AZOTE AND A LITTLE OXYGEN WITH A TRACE OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN AND THAT THE GAS IN THE SECOND BOTTLE WAS PRINCIPALLY AZOTE WITH A LITTLE OXYGEN AND CARBONIC ACID CONSIDERING THE MANNER IN WHICH THE BOTTLES HAD BEEN KEPT IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE AZOTE AND OXYGEN WERE DERIVED FROM ATMOSPHERIC AIR UNCONNECTED WITH THE VOLCANO AND THAT THE CARBONIC ACID AND TRACE OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN ALONE WERE OF VOLCANIC ORIGIN THE PRESENCE OF THE ACID GAS IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR SUPPOSING IT TO BE DERIVED BY THE ACTION OF HEAT FROM ROCKS CONTAINING CARBONATE OF LIME AND MAGNESIA EARTHS WHICH WE HAVE SEEN ARE CONTAINED IN THE CINDERS AND ASHES EJECTED IN ONE PLACE OUTSIDE OF THE VOLCANO IN THE SEA CAPTAIN WODE HOUSE OBSERVED A GREAT BUBBLING OF AILR AS IF THE WATER WAS BOILING HE AP PROACHED IT AND EVEN WENT OVER IT IN A BOAT AND FOUND ITS TEMPERATURE NOT ABOVE THAT OF THE ADJOINING SURFACE AND THERE WAS NO PECULIAR ODOUR PERCEP TIBLE IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT NONE OF THIS GAS WAS COLLECTED BUT PROBABLY IT ALSO WAS CARBONIC ACID GAS AND ARISING FROM THE CALCINING EFFECT OF HEAT ON THE SUBJACENT ROCKS FORMING THE BED OF THE SEA SHORTLY AFTER IT IS SAID THE BUBBLING CONTINUING THE WATER BECAME VERY HOT WHICH IS CONFIRMATORY OF THE ABOVE CONJECTURE 2 K2 247DR DAVYS ACCOUNT OF A NEW VOLCANO I HAVE STATED ALREADY THAT WHILST I WAS AT THE VOLCANO NO INDICATIONS AP PEARED OF THE DISENGAGEMENT OF ANY INFLAMMABLE GAS AND NOT EVEN OF ANY ACID GAS OR VAPOUR I HAVE CONVERSED WITH MANY GENTLEMEN ON WHOSE ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION I COULD PLACE DEPENDENCE AND THEIR EXPERIENCE AGREED WITH MINE EXCEPTING THAT ONE OR TWO OF THEM PERCEIVED DISTINCTLY ACID FUMES WHICH FROM THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN OF THEIR EFFECTS WHEN RESPIRED IT MAY BE INFERRED WERE OF SULPHUREOUS ACID PROBABLY A LITTLE SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN ALSO WAS EVOLVED BUT IT MUST HAVE BEEN IN EXTREMELY MINUTE QUANTITY OTHERWISE IT COULD NOT HAVE ESCAPED NOTICE IN THE GAS I EXAMINED THE TRACE OF IT WAS SO SLIGHT THAT IT WAS NOT DISCOVERABLE BY MEANS OF FRESHLY PRECIPITATED OXIDE OF LEAD A FEW PARTICLES OF IT AGITATED WITH THE GAS WERE NOT IN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE DIS COLOURED IN AN ACCOUNT OF THE VOLCANO PUBLISHED IN THE MALTA GAZETTE OF THE 25TH AUGUST IT IS STATED THAT CARBURETTED HYDROGEN WAS EVOLVED FROM IT AND THAT COAL DEPRIVED OF BITUMEN OCCURRED AMONGST THE ASHES AND SCORIAE AS THE WRITER DOES NOT APPEAR TO HAVE ASCERTAINED EITHER OF THESE POINTS IN THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THEY COULD BE DETERMINED IN A SATISFACTORY MANNER NAMELY BY EXPERI MENT I AM UNDER THE NECESSITY OF SUPPOSING THAT HIS STATEMENT IN THESE PAR TICULARS IS NOT CORRECT AND THAT THE APPEARANCES TO WHICH HE TRUSTED WERE FAL LACIOUS THE RESULTS OF MY LATTER INQUIRIES IT WILL BE PERCEIVED LIKE THOSE WHICH PRE CEDED THEM ARE ENTIRELY NEGATIVE  AND THEY ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE WHICH MY BROTHER THE LATE SIR HUMPHRY DAVY OBTAINED AT VESUVIUS WHICH HE HAS DESCRIBED IN A PAPER  ON THE PHENOMENA OF VOLCANOS PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1828 AND REASONING ON THEM IN RELATION TO THE THEORY OF VOLCANOS IN GENERAL THEY APPEAR VERY FAVOURABLE TO THAT HYPO THESIS OF VOLCANIC ACTION TO WHICHL HE GAVE THE PREFERENCE BOTH IN THE PAPER JUST ALLUDED TO AND STILL MORE DECIDEDLY IN HIS POSTHUMOUS WORK I CONSOLA TIONS IN TRAVEL  NAMELY THE SIMPLE HYPOTHESIS OF AN IGNITED NUCLEUS OF FUSED MATTER OCCASIONALLY FORCED THROUGH THE COOLED CRUST OF THE EARTH BY THE EX PANSIVE POWER OF STEAM AND GAS IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE ALL THE PHENOMENA AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE VOLCANO HAPPILY ACCORD WITH THIS VIEW THE SITUA TION OF THE ERUPTION MANY MILES DISTANT FROM THE NEAREST SHORE SEEMS TO BE INCOMPATIBLE WITH ITS HAVING ANY CONNEXION WITH THE ATMOSPHERE AND THIS 248IN THE MEDITERRANEAN IDEA IS SUPPORTED BY THE DEPTH OF THE SEA WHERE THE VOLCANO APPEAREDA DEPTH WHICH ACCORDING TO THE MOST ACCURATE SURVEY MUST HAVE BEEN AT LEAST 50 OR 60 FATHOMS FURTHER THE PRODUCTS EXAMINED WHETHER SOLID OR GASEOUS MAY BE SAID TO DEMONSTRATE THAT ORDINARY COMBUSTION WAS NOWISE CONCERNED IN THE PHENOMENA AND THE ABSENCE OF INFLAMMABLE GAS IN ANY EFFICIENT QUANTITY OF WHICH IT APPEARS TO ME NO DOUBT CAN BE ENTERTAINED SEEMS NO LESS FORCIBLY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE DECOMPOSITION OF WATER BY THE METALLIC BASES OF THE EARTHS AND ALKALIES CANNOT BE ADMITTED AS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE SUPPOSE A STATE OF THINGS IN CONFORMITY WITH THE HYPOTHESIS OF OUR GLOBE HAVING BEEN ONCE IN FUSION AND BEING STILL SO AT A CERTAIN DEPTH BENEATH THE SURFACE LIABLE TO BE ACTED UPON BY WATER FLOWING IN FROM ABOVE THE PHENOMLENA OF THE VOLCANO DO NOT SEEM TO BE OF DIFFICULT EXPLANATION THEY ARE INDEED SUCH AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED A PRIORI NAMELY THE VAST QUANTITY OF AQUEOUS VAPOUR EVOLVED IMPREGNATED WITH SALT THE POROUS CINDERS AND ASHES EJECTED THE COMPARATIVELY LOW TEMPERATURE OF THE EJECTED MATTERS AND THE APPARENT ABSENCE OF ANY GAS IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY EXCEPTING CARBONIC ACID ALL THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE MADE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE VOLCANIC REGIONS OF ITALY SICILY AND THE LIPARI ISLANDS HAVE BEEN OF THE SAME NEGATIVE CHARACTER AS THE PRECEDING AND FAVOURABLE TO THE SAME HYPOTHESIS RATHER THAN TO THAT OF THE CHEMICAL ORIGIN OF VOLCANOS THE SUBJECT HOWEVER IS SO MYSTE RIOUS THAT WHAT IS PROBABLE ON FURTHER INQUIRY MAY NOT PROVE TRUE AND OTHER CAUSES MAY BE DISCOVERED WHICH AT PRESENT ARE NOT EVEN IMAGINED MALTA OCTOBER 25TH 1831 EXPLANATION OF THE PLATES PLATE V A PLAN OF THE ISLAND WITH SOUNDINGS FROM A SURVEY BY CAPTAIN WODE

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,105548,OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON DIFFERENT EXTRACTS OF HEMLOCK BY MICHAEL MORRIS M D F R S,I206919,172 XXXII OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS ON DIFFERENT EXTRACTS OF HEMLOCK BY MI CHAEL MORRIS M D F R S DR WADE AN EMINENT PHYSICIAN AT LISBON HAVING LATELY COMMUNI CATED TO THE LONDON MEDICAL SOCIETY A NUMBER OF CASSES IN WHICH THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK PREPARED AT COIMBRA IN PORTUGAL HAD BEEN GIVEN WITH EXTRAOR DINARY SUCCESS AND HAVING SENT ME AT THE SAME TIME SPECIMENS OF THE SUCCESSFUL EXTRACT AND ALSO OF THE EXTRACTS OF HEMLOCK PREPARED AT LISBON AND BY DR STORCKS APOTHECARY AT VIENNA WHICH TWO LASTMEN TIONED EXTRACTS HE HAD PRESCRIBED FOR THE SPACE OF THREE YEARS IN VARIOUS DISORDERS TO LITTLE OR NO EFFECT I THOUGHT AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE COM PONENT PARTS OF THESE EXTRACTS AND THAT USED IN LON DON MIGHT BE ATTENDED WITH SOME USEFUL OR CURIOUS CONSEQUENCES MORE ESPECIALLY AS THIS MEDICINE WAS NEAR LOSING ITS CREDIT INTIRELY FROM ITS LITTLE SUCCESS HERE IN THOSE DISORDERS IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN MOST STRONGLY RECOMMENDED BY DR STORCK I THINK IT NOT UNNECESSARY TO PREMISE FARTHER THAT THE EXTRACT PRE PARED AT COIMBRA IS NOT SO MOIST AS THE OTHER EXTRACTS AND THAT IT HAS BEEN GIVEN FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AT THE DOSE OF A DRACHM AND A HALF TWICE A DAY WITH OUT PRODUCING THE LEAST DISAGREEABLE SYMPTOM E X READ MAY 24 1764173 E X P E R I M E N T I 24 GRAINS OF THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK PREPARED AT COIMBRA DIGESTED WITH AN OUNCE OF HIGHLY REC TIFYED SPIRIT OF WINE FOR 36 HOURS IN A WARM ROOM GAVE A BROWNISH YELLOW TINCTURE THE CLEAR LIQUOR BE ING POURED OFF A FRESH QUANTITY OF SPIRIT WAS ADDED AS BEFORE AND EXPOSED TO DIGESTION FOR THE SAME SPACE OF TIME THE SECOND TINCTURE WAS CONSIDERABLY LESS COLOURED THIS ADDED TO THE FORMER TINCTURE WAS FIL TERED AND EXPOSED TO THE AIR IN A WARM ROOM UNTIL THE SPIRIT WAS INTIRELY EVAPORATED THE DRY RE SIDUUM WEIGHED FIVE GRAINS ON EXPOSING IT TO THE AIR IT BECAME SOFTER AND EVEN MOIST AT THE SURFACE ON POURING SOME WATER ON THE RESIDUUM NOW MOIST IT WAS SOON TINGED OF A BROWNISH YELLOW WHICH BEING POURED OFF AND A FRESH QUANTITY ADDED AT DIFFERENT TIMES UNTIL AN OUNCE AND A HALF OF WA TER HAD BEEN USED THERE REMAINED SOME BLACKISH MATTER NOT SOLUBLE IN WATER WHICH WHEN DRY WEIGHED ONE GRAIN DID NOT ATTRACT THE MOISTURE OF THE AIR MELTED AND BURNED WITH A BRIGHT FLAME WHEN EX POSED TO THE FIRE WAS SOLUBLE IN SPIRIT OF WINE AND HAD EVERY CHARACTERISTIC OF A REZIN THE TINGED WATER WHICH HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM THIS REZIN AND FILTERED WAS EVAPORATED SLOWLY UNTIL A BROWN DRY MATTER REMAINED WEIGHING THREE GRAINS WHICH IN A FEW HOURS ATTRACTED THE MOISTURE OF THE AIR AND RELENTED INTO A DARK BROWN THICK LIQUOUR OF A SALINE TASTE AND THE SMELL PECULIAR TO THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK ONE DROP OF THIS LIQUOR DILUTED WITH A LITTLE WATER DISTROYED THE COLOUR OF TEN TIMES THE QUANTITY 2174 QUANTITY OF SYROP OF VIOLETS WITHOUT GIVING IT THE LEAST RED TINT REDUCING IT ON ADDING SOME DROPS OF OLE UM TARTARI PER DELIQUIUM IT SUFFERED NO REMARKABLE CHANGE SPIRIT OF SALT DID NOT OCCASION ANY ALTERATION IN IT BUT WITH OIL OF VITRIOL THERE WAS A STRONG EFFER VESCENCE WITHOUT ANY SENSIBLE FUME IT APPEARS FROM THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE CO IMBRA EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK CONTAINS ONE FIFTH SOLUBLE IN SPIRIT OF WINE 35THS OF WHICH CONSIST OF AN OILY ESSENTIAL SALT THE REMAINDER BEING A RESIN E X P E R I M E N T II THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK FROM VIENNA WAS SOFTER THAN THAT FROM COIMBRA ON BREAKING IT THERE AP PEARED SMALL WHITISH STREAKS ON EACH SURFACE 24 GRAINS OF IT TREATED AS IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS WITH SPIRIT OF WINE GAVE A FINE DEEP GREEN TINCTURE WHICH ON EVAPORATION GAVE A RESIDUUM OF A DARK GREEN TOWARDS THE EDGES OF THE CUP AND A DARK BROWN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE THE WHOLE RESIDUUM WHEN DRY WEIGHED TWO GRAINS AND 14 ON LEAVING IT EXPOSED TO THE AIR THE BROWN MATTER ATTRACTED MOISTURE FROM IT AND RELENTED INTO A THICK BROWN LIQUOUR ON ADDING WATER TO IT AS IN THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE COIMBRA EXTRACT THE SOLUTION WAS OF A LIGHT GREEN COLOUR ON EVAPORATION IT GAVE 34THS OF A GRAIN OF DARK BROWN RESIDUUM WHICH RAN PER DELIQUIUM INTO A BROWN LIQUOUR DIFFERING ONLY IN COLOUR FROM THAT OBTAINED BY A SIMILAR PROCESS FROM THE COIMBRA EXTRACT THE UNDISSOLVED RESINOUS MATTER WEIGHED 12 GRAIN WAS OF A GREENISH COLOUR BUT IN OTHER RESPECTS LIKE THE RESIN OF THE COIMBRA EXTRACT IT APPEARS FROM THE GREEN TINCTURE175 TINCTURE COMMUNICATED BOTH TO WATER AND RECTIFYED SPIRIT BY THE VIENNA EXTRACT THAT THE HEMLOCK HAD BEEN GATHERED TOO SOON AND BEFORE THE PLANT WAS IN VIGOUR E X P III THE SPIRITUOUS TINCTURE OF THE LISBON EXTRACT WAS NOT SO GREEN NOR WAS THE GREEN SO DURABLE AS THAT OF THE VIENNA EXTRACT THE PHAENOMENA IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE OTHER EXPERIMENTS DID NOT DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE OF THE VIENNA EXTRACT E X P IV THE SPIRITUOUS TINCTURE OF THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK PREPARED AT THE APOTHECARYSHALL WAS LIKE IN CO LOUR TO THAT OF COIMBRA BUT THE RESIDUUM DID NOT DIFFER CONSIDERABLY FROM THAT OF VIENNA AND LISBON THIS EXTRACT HAS BEEN USED WITH SOME SUCCESS AT THE WESTMINSTERHOSPITAL E X P V THE SPIRITUOUS TINCTURE OF THE POWDERED LEAVES OF HEMLOCK WAS LIKE IN COLOUR TO THE LAST THE RESIDU UM DIFFERED MATERIALLY FROM THAT OF THE FORMER EX TRACTS ONLY IN ITS REZINS BEING CONSIDERABLY MORE FLUID THESE EXPERIMENTS SHEW THAT THE EXTRACT OF HEMLOCK PREPARED AT COIMBRA CONTAINS A FAR GREATER QUAN TITY OF AN ESSENTIAL OILY SALT AND REZIN THAN THE OTHER EXTRACTS AS THE OILS SALTS AND REZINS ARE THE MOST ACT 5 IVE176 TIVE PARTS OF VEGETABLES MAY NOT THE WELLATTESTED SA LUTARY EFFECTS OF THE COIMBRA EXTRACT BE OWING TO ITS GREATER QUANTITY OF THESE ACTIVE PRINCIPLES PARTICULARLY IF WE CONSIDER THE LARGE DOSE IT HAS BEEN PRESCRIBED IN AS THESE ACTIVE OILY SALTS AND REZINS ARE SOLUBLE IN SPIRIT OF WINE WE HAVE THE MEANS OF OBTAINING THEM FROM THE EXTRACT OF OUR OWN HEMLOCK IN SUFFI CIENT QUANTITIES FOR USE AND WITHOUT FATIGUING THE STOMACH WITH THE NAUSEOUS INACTIVE PARTS OF THE EXTRACT BUT AS EXPERIENCE ALONE CAN SHEW WHETHER THE VIRTUES OF THE HEMLOCK RESIDE IN THE WHOLE EXTRACT OR IN THE SAPONACEOUS PARTS SOLUBLE IN SPIRIT OF WINE I SHALL CONTENT MYSELF WITH PROPOSING THESE FEW HINTS UNTIL EXPERIMENTS SHALL ENABLE ME TO LAY THE OTHER CONSEQUENCES OF THESE ASSAYS WITH PROPER WEIGHT BE FORE THE SOCIETY XXXIII AN

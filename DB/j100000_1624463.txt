series The nearest neighbor is the Mineral Caoutchouc Elaterite or Wurtzilite which in turn has at no great distance from it a substance with which it is said to have most intimate relations Ozocerite or Mineral Wax and but a short distance from the latter is probably the highest grade asphaltic limestone in the United States Maltha also occurs in the region petroleum springs are also known and the shales and limestones of the Green River formation are frequently found heavily impregnated with bitumen The region as a whole therefore offers a most advantageous opportunity for the study of the field relations of hydrocarbons R UINS OF Q UIRIG UA THE village of Quirigua is about 20 miles to the west of Izabal in Lat N 15 15 and W Long 89 Nine miles away are the ruins situated on the left bank of the Motagua Dense tropical forests cover the hills and valleys for miles around and the only means of approach is through narrow mule paths till within some two miles from the ruins when a passageway has to be cut by the mozos or Indian guides with their machetes The trees are of immense size mahogany ebony and lignumvitse be ing plentiful Creepers and vines of all kinds hang down from these trees making travel both dangerous and difficult in a tropical region where venomous insects and reptiles abound The first one sees on reaching the ruins is a small lake which the Indians have named  Lake of the Idols An artificial mound built of small stones is within a stones throw of the lake As many of these rocks are of very fine marble they probably came from the bed of the Monta gua river two or three miles away At the base of this mound there are three obelisks 16 to 18 feet high Each has a human face sculptured on its south side The features of these faces are generally flattened about the forehead the under lip large and hang ing the upper quite short flat nosed and very large eyes with a staring look The mouth is open in most cases and there ap pears to be a slight growth of beard The other sides of these obelisks are covered with hieroglyphics enclosed in squares many representing animals trees etc In a southerly direction we find the largest of the six obelisks this one being 26 feet high 5 feet wide and 4 feet thick It is 12 feet out of the perpendicular It is quite probable that fully 6 or 8 feet of these shafts are buried in the soil All the sculptured parts of the inclined obelisk of Quirigua are certainly finer and more elaborate than on the others the features are more regular the nose which is a foot long is much sharper and the lips are not so full The mouth is eight inches wide and the left side is broader than the right The ears are square and are adorned with rings The head is covered with a species of helmet shaped like a human face the south side is similar to the north side already described whilst the east and west have each a double row of squares contain ing hieroglyphics to the number of forty A few feet away lies an obelisk which was standing a very few years ago accord ing to the guides The face on this one is different from the others for instance the ears are round instead of square and are formed of three concentric circles This shaft is 18 feet high 4 feet wide and 3 feet thick The present condition of the sixth obelisk is not as good as some of the others The face which is 2 feet long by 1 feet has lost the nose and the mouth is almost obliterated also the ears are square and have no rings Diagonally across the 832 SCIENCEJUNE 5 1896 SCIENCE breast of the idol lies a child which is partly reclining on one hand The quality of this work would seem to prove that the same artist made both this and the in clined shaft The only difference in the face on the south side is that the ears are ornamented with rings The east and west sides have each 34 rectangles arranged in pairs and all containing hieroglyphics As the land hereabouts is but slightly above the general level of the river there is no doubt that the frequent inundations have buried many other monuments The idols of Quiriguk have no altars like those of Copan but within the space occu pied by the aforementioned there are two immense stones which very probably served as such The first one is nearly round some 12 feet in diameter and is situated a few feet from the first obelisk The upper portion is painted red and a sculptured tigers head can be made out having a human head under it A line of finely sculptured glyphs covers the back What looks like a seat occupies the center around which there are several grooves which run toward the floor All this would seem to indicate the use of this stone as a sacrificial altar The second stone which is between the fourth and fifth obelisks and to the east of them is long and oval being 6 feet high and 25 feet in circumference The whole surface is covered with figures in semire lief which are in a much better state of preservation than those seen on the other monuments One of these figures repre sents a woman without hands or legs but with the arms extending to the floor The forehead is narrow Another figure is that of a turtle whose eyes are one foot across representations of many fruits and flowers now found in the surrounding mountains covered the rest of this stone This fact seems to explode the idea of many regarding a change of climate since the Central American cities monuments etc were built There are several sculptured stones which are completely covered with moss and tropical vegetation and deeply imbedded in the soft humus On one of them a tigers head could be made out and wherever the moss could be scraped away hieroglyphics appeared The truncated pyramid of Quirigu6 is some 28 feet high Oblong blocks of sand stone have been used in constructing it but the whole is a mass of broken rock today There are two platforms on the pyramid the second one having a series of circular niches usually two feet in diameter and fairly well preserved Although the monuments of Quirigua are larger than those of Copan they are inferior in sculpture and their extremely weathered and ruined condition would prove them to be much older also Some historians have stated that Quirigua was a large city destroyed by the Aztecs when at the height of their power on the plain of Anahuac The site is indeed pic turesque Today it is the abode of the denizens of the forest reptiles seeming to have taken to it with special gusto JOHN R CHANDLER GUATEMALA CENTRAL AMERICA April 1896 CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY PRIMITIVE ETHNOLOGY OF FRANCE BASING his researches on the measure ments of nearly 700 skulls and an exami nation of abundant artefacts of the palaeo lithic and neolithic periods M P Salmon has constructed a map showing the ethnol ogy of France in the stone age The results arrived at may be briefly stated to be that the whole of the territory was down to neolithic times occupied by a people dis tinctly longskulled though probably of two different types These were not vio lently dispossessed or exterminated but 833

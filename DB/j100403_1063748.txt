plaintiff was en ventre sa minre and before she could have been born viable she was injured by an injury to her mother then a passenger on the defendants electric car The plaintiff now sues to recover for the injuries she sustained Held the plaintiff cannot re cover Lipp v Milwaukee Ry  Light Co Wis 159 N W 916 Where it would be to the childs benefit to be considered as being born or living while still en ventre sa tmere it is so considered for many pur poses both by the civil and common law Villar v Gilbey 1907 A C 139 Thus such a child is considered as born in the life time of the testatrix and living at its fathers death for the purpose of taking a legacy under a will Gibson zv Gibson 2 Freem Chy 223 Trowe v Butts 1 S  S 181 Also such a child can take under a devise to a certain class of persons living at the testators decease Doe v Clarke 2 H Bl 399 It is said that the basis of the rule is that the potential existence of the child places it within the reason and motive of the gift In re Salaoman 1908 1 Ch D 4 A child en veitre sa mere is also within the purview of the Statute of Distributions Iallis v Hodson 2 Atk 114 And it can recover under Lord Campbells Act for the wrongful death of its father State v Soale 36 Ind App 73 74 N E 1111 The George and Richard L R 3 Adm 466 Where marriage and the birth of issue is necessary to revoke a will made prior to marriage it is not necessary that the issue be actually born before the testators death Doe v Lancashire 5 T R 49 According to the common law if a person kill a child en veittre sa mere it is a great misprison but no murder but if the child die after birth from injuries received while in its mothers womb it is murder for in law it is considered a reasonable creature in rerunm nature when it is born alive 3 COKE INST 50 Nevertheless the courts have quite con sistently refused to allow an infant to recover for injuries received before its birth Alliare v St Lukes Hospital 184 Ill 359 56 N E 638 48 L R A 225 75 Am St Rep 176 Nugent v Brooklyn Heights R Co 154 App Div 667 139 N Y Supp 367 See Walker v Great N Ry Co 28 L R Ir 69 But surely one willfully injured while still a foetus has a right of action against the wrongdoer See Walker v Great N Ry Co supra An unborn child should surely be entitled to have its body as well as its property protected See Nugent v Brooklyn Heights Ry Co supra Therefore when the child can be said to be a separate entity dis tinct from its mother that is when it could have been born viable it seems that the infant should be allowed to maintain an action for a negligent injury to it See dissenting opinion in Allaire v St Lukes Hos pital supra But if an infant is so little advanced in foetal life that it could not live if separated from its mother it must still be considered a part of her and any injury to the child is merged into the injury to the mother Gorman v Budlong 23 R I 169 49 Atl 704 55 L R A 118 91 Am St Rep 629 Buel v United Railways Co 248 Mo 126 154 S W 71 45 L R A N S 625 Thus when an injury causes the premature birth of a child which dies soon afterwards on account of having been separated from its mother its administrator can maintain no action for 411VIRGINIA LAW RElIEW its wrongful death Dietrich v Northampton 138 Mass 14 52 Am Rep 242 As the plaintiff in the principal case could not have been born viable when the injury occurred the decision seems sound MASTER AND SERVANTDUTY TO INSTRUCTHow TO AVOID INJURYPlain tiffs intestate was employed by defendant as a telephone lineman Tele phone lines were being put up on crossarms to poles upon which high power electric wires were stretched He was set to work clipping cables after being shown how to make only one clipping by a fellow employee he was however warned two or three times that the wires were live wires and that they would kill him if he came in contact with them While engaged in making his first clipping without assistance he touched one of the electric wires and was instantly killed Held the defendant is not liable Bristol Telephone Co v Stocktons Admr Va 90 S E 636 Stated in the most general terms the extent of the masters obligation in regard to imparting information to a servant is to give him such in struction as will enable him to avoid injury 1 LABATT MASTER AND SERVANT  252 See Atlas Engine Works v Randall 100 Ind 293 50 Am Rep 798 Where a person of ordinary intelligence is employed to do dangerous work with which he is unfamiliar a mere warning that the work is dangerous and that he must be careful in the absence of any instruction how to avoid the danger involved is not sufficient to relieve the employer of liability American Strawboard Co v Foust 12 Ind App 421 39 N E 891 Thus where a railroad company employs one unfa miliar with the work of a brakeman it was its duty not only to warn him of the danger incident to the work but to show him how the work might be done safely Reynolds v Boston etc Ry Co 64 Vt 66 24 Atl 134 Again where a servant is put to work painting near electric ma chinery and is injured while so engaged on account of a failure to in struct him how to avoid the danger involved the master is liable Dirken v Great N Paper Co 110 Me 374 86 Atl 320 Ann Cas 1914D 396 And where an inexperienced servant is employed at dangerous machin ery the master is bound to give him such instruction as will cause him to appreciate and understand the danger of the employment Quinin v Electric Laundry Co 155 Cal 500 101 Pac 794 17 Ann Cas 1100 Whether the servant has been sufficiently instructed is primarily a question for the jury and their findings should not be interfered with where different inferences may be drawn from the evidence 1 LABATT MASTER AND SERVANT  252 Reynolds v Boston etc Ry Co supra Mc

Professor Brewers book gives the layman a clear conception of the meaning of the term and a definite idea of the means of ap proach While the book contains nothing original it is not at all a compilation The author has shown marked ability in sifting and arranging material and has been fairminded in his selection It is an excellent book for the student of educational and social problems to read as a preliminary measure to definite and closer contact with the various ideas and notions behind the vocational guidance movement The reviewer uses the word notions quite deliberately for in his experience he has seen more foolish thought and practice in vocational guidance than in any other vocational movement Professor Brewer has set before us the field and leaves us free to build upon the sortings of ideas good and bad He opens the way for another book equally honest in its endeavor but more scientific less influenced by what has been done and more concerned with what may be done in

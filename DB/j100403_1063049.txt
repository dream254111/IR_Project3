v Boston  M R Co 9 Cush Mass 108 Dillon v Great Northern R Co 38 Mont 485 100 Pac 960 Nor could there be recovery by the administrator suing in behalf of certain designated beneficiaries because this provision is modeled after Lord Campbells Act and the benefits to be expected must be pecuniary and financial Michigan Central R Co v Vreeland 227 U S 59 Thus a father and mother suing under this statute cannot recover for the loss of a son when it does not appear that they are financially in terested in his life American R Co etc v Didricksen 227 U S 145 Hence the decision of the principal case that when death is instanta neous and there are no beneficiaries pecuniarly interested there can be no recovery at all is manifestly correct FOREIGN CORPORATIONSFAILURE TO COMPLY WITH STATUTEEFFECT ON CONTRACTSA Kentucky statute provides that it shall not be lawful for any corporation to carry on business within the state until it shall have filed in the office of the Secretary of State a statement giving the loca tion of its office therein and the name of its agent upon whom proc ess may be served and that any corporation failing to comply with the section and any agent thereof who transacts business within the state shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and fined In an action by a foreign corporation on a contract made before compliance with the statute Field the contract is void Oliver Co v Louisville Realty Co Ky 161 S W 570 See NoTEs p 470 GUARDIAN AND WARDMORTGAGE OF WARDS REALTYAUTHORITY OF IN CAPACITATED GUARDIAN PASSING TO SUCCESSORA guardian obtained an or der from court authorizing him to execute a mortgage on the property of his ward Before this mortgage was executed the guardian was in capacitated and a successor duly appointed Acting solely on the au thority of the former guardian the successor executed the mortgage Held the authority given to the first guardian passes ipso facto to his successor Bank v Bangs Kan 136 Pac 915 In the absence of an order of court directing it or a statute authoriz ing it a guardian has no power to mortgage the real property of his ward Roscoe v McDonald 101 Mich 313 59 N W 603 As to whether such authority when given to one guardian passes ipso facto to his suc cessor there seems to be a scarcity of authority on the question But in the analogous case of the appointment of an administrator d b n the rule is that a general power to dispose of realty given to one adminis trator does pass ipso facto to his successor on due appointment and quali fication Gress Lum Co v Leitner 91 Ga 810 18 S E 62 Rogers v Johnson 125 Mo 202 28 S W 635 There would seem to be no reason why the same rule should not apply in the case of the successor of an incapacitated guardian Since a guardian is an officer of the court and the execution of the mortgage is under the supervision of the court it would seem that the power to execute such a mortgage is one apper taining to the office of guardian rather than to the person and it fol 491VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW lows that such power given to one guardian should pass to his succes sor on due appointment and qualification INNKEEPERSINJURY TO PERSON OF GUTSTASSAULT BY SZRVANTThe plaintiff a guest in the defendants hotel was maliciously assaulted by a servant of the defendant Held the defendant having retained the servant in his employ after obtaining knowledge of the servants violent temper and disposition to assault guests is liable for damages for the servants malicious assault Duckworth v Appostalis Tenn 208 Fed 5936 An innkeeper is not an insurer of the personal safety of his guests and is only bound to exercise reasonable care in that behalf Week v McNulty 101 Tenn 495 48 S W 809 70 Am St Rep 693 43 L R A 185 He is not liable for an assault upon a guest by a servant where he has not been guilty of negligence in employing or retaining the serv ant and the act was beyond the general scope of the servants employ ment Rahmel v Lehndorf 142 Cal 681 76 Pac 659 100 Am St Rep 154 65 L R A 88 Clancy v Barker 131 Fed 161 66 C C A 469 69 L R A 653 The decisions holding an innkeeper liable for the malicious assaults on guests by his servants following the analogy of the liability of com mon carriers can be based on the failure of the innkeeper to exercise reasonable care in preventing the injury Rahmel v Lehndorf supra dictum Or on the fact that the servant was acting within the gen eral scope of his employment De Wolf v Ford 193 N Y 397 86 N E 527 The principal case does not extend the liability of innkeepers to that of common carriers but holds an innkeeper liable for negligence in retaining a servant known to have a disposition to assault guests and therefore seems sound on reason and principle INSURANCENOTICE oF CANCELLATION OF FIRE INSURANCE POLICYNotice of the cancellation of a fire insurance policy was addressed and sent by registered mail to the insured the envelope bearing the card of an other insurance company although the name of the insurers agent also appeared on the card The letter was received by the insured but was not opened until after the loss occurred Held the notice is not suffi cient to cancel the policy Fritz v Penn Fire Ins Co N J 88 Atl 1065 When a policy provides for cancellation on giving a certain num ber of days notice and the notice is sent by mail it must be proved by the party setting up the cancellation that the letter was actually re ceived the requisites number of days prior to the cancellation Am Fire Ins Co v Brooks 83 Md 22 34 Atl 373 Crown Point Iron Co v Etna Ins Co 127 N Y 608 28 N E 653 No question was raised in these cases as to the actual opening of the letters The principal case pre sents a novel set of facts The court based its decision on the ground that the envelope bore the name of another insurance company and that the insured might well assume that its contents had no reference to his business with the company in which he was insured This reason ing seems sound had the letter been unregistered but considered in 492

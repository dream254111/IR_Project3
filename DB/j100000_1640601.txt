educational questions A more intense consciousness of our common vocation our common object and common destiny and a more resolute desire to apply the meth ods of science methods of inquiry and publicity to our work in teachingthese are the things which call for the existence of organized effort Surely we shall have the judgment the courage and the self sacrifice commensurate with reverence for our calling which is none other than the discovery and diffusion of truth No one has any illusions about what can be imme diately accomplished Let us therefore arm ourselves with patience and endurance in view of remoter issues No one under estimates the practical difficulties in our way But arming ourselves with the good will and mutual confidence our profession exacts of us we shall go forward and overcome them JOHN DEWEY ORGANIZATION OF THE 2AMERICAN ASSO CIATION OF UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS THE meeting called for the purpose of organizing this association was held in the auditorium of the Chemists Club New York City on the afternoon and evening of Friday January 1 and the morning of Saturday January 2 1915 Over 250 were in attendance in the course of the three sessions Professor John Dewey of Colum bia University called the meeting to order and delivered an introductory address upon the purpose and possibilities of such an association as conceived by the committee on organization of which he had served as chairman Nominations for the chairman ship of the meeting being called for Pro fessor Dewey was nominated and elected permanent chairman and Professor Over street of the College of the City of New York recording secretary Addresses in support of a motion to proceed to the or ganization of the association were made by Professors Guthe of Michigan Thilly of Cornell West of Princeton Howard of Nebraska and a letter from Professor Gildersleeve of Johns Hopkins was read The motion was unanimously carried The consideration of the draft of a con stitution submitted by the committee on organization was then begun This took up most of the afternoon and evening and a part of the morning session In order that the alternative plans of organization might receive full discussion the meeting in most cases voted upon the principles in volved in the several articles rather than upon the language of the instrument A committee was appointed to draw up the text of a provisional constitution in con formity with the action taken by the meet ing this draft to be submitted for ratifica tion at the next annual meeting The deci sions of the gathering with respect to the principal features of the plan of organi zation were as follows 1 NameAfter the consideration of a number of alternatives it was voted that the name of the society be The American Association of University Professors 2 Eligibility for MembershipIt was voted that any person may be nominated for membership who holds and for ten years has held a teaching or research posi tion in any one or more than one American university or college or in a professional school of similar grade provided that no person not having teaching or research for his principal occupation and no administra tive officer not giving a substantial amount of instruction shall be eligible Nomina tions for membership may be made to the council by any three members of the asso ciation nominations thus made and ap SCIENCE 151N S VOL XLI No 1048 proved by the council will be voted upon at annual meetings a twothirds vote being required to elect For the guidance of the council in acting upon nominations it was voted upon motion of Professor Janeway that it is the sense of this meeting that the association shall be composed of college and university teachers of recognized scholarship or scientific productivity It was voted that all persons to whom invitations to attend the first meeting had been sent by the committee on organiza tion may become members of the associa tion by signifying to the secretary their desire to do so within three months from January 1 provided that they hold posi tions in institutions of collegiate or uni versity grade and that their duties are not solely administrative 3 OfficersIt was voted that the officers of the association shall be a president a vicepresident a secretary a treasurer and a council consisting of the foregoing and 30 additional members The president and vicepresident are to be elected by a major ity vote for a term of one year the secre tary and treasurer are to hold office for three years Thirty members of the council are to be elected for the first year lots being drawn to determine which shall hold office for one for two and for three years respectively at each subsequent annual meeting ten members of the council are to be elected by a plurality vote to hold office for three years The council has power to arrange the program for the annual meet ing and to appoint committees to investi gate and report upon subjects germane to the purposes of the association During the year 1915 the council is authorized to spend such sums out of the funds of the association as may be necessary for the business of the year and also to defray expenses incurred in the organization of the association 4 Local SocietiesThe question of the formation of local societies was discussed at some length Although the sentiment of the meeting was apparently unfavorable to this plan the council was authorized to take the matter under consideration and to report at the next meeting upon the desir ability of the formation of institutional or territorial chapters 5 DuesThe annual dues were fixed at 200 The greater part of the concluding ses sion was given up to the discussion of topics to be placed upon the program of the association for the ensuing year The secretary of the committee on organization read a number of interestingly diverse topics suggested in writing by members not present A paper by Professor Royce of Harvard University on The Case of Middlebury College and the Carnegie Foundation was read proposing as a suitable subject the question of the limits of standardization in educational methods and organization and the standardizing activities of extraacademic corporations This subject and the two following were finally recommended to the council as the topics most suitable for examination by special committees and report during the coming year methods of appointment and promotion the manner in which the uni versity teaching profession is at present re cruited with especial reference to the exist ing system of graduate fellowships and scholarships Upon Professor Seligmans motion the council was also instructed to attempt to bring about a merging in a new committee of the committees already created by the economic political science and so ciological associations to deal with the sub ject of academic freedom the joint com mittee to be authorized to investigate the subject in behalf of this association and to report at the next annual meeting 152 SCIENCE3ANITAT 29 1915 The committee appointed to present nom nations for officers for the year 1915

Votes of thanks were extended to the Chemists Club for their courtesies to the Womens University Club for hospitalities to woman members of the profession in at tendance at the meeting and to the officers and members of the committee on organi zation The meeting notable in the hisn tory of the American universities and dis tinguished by the number of eminent scholars attending and by the interest and quality of its discussions then adjourned It is perhaps advisable to put on record at this time the history of the steps ante cedent to this meeting taken in the organi zation of the new association The project was initiated by aa communication signed by most of the full professors of the fae ulty of the Johns Hopkins University which was sent in the spring of 1913 to the members of the faculties of nine others universities inviting the latter to consider the advisability of the formation of such a society and to send delegates to an in formal conference for discussion of the matter A favorable response was receivedl in all cases and statements expressing a conviction of the desirability of the crea tion of some such professional association were drawn up and signed by members of the faculties of nearly all the universities addressed The proposed conference was held at Baltimore on November 17 1913 it was attended by 18 delegates from the following universities Clark Colum bia Cornell Harvard Johns Hopkins Princeton Wisconsin and Yale The chair man of this conference Professor Bloom field was authorized to appoint a com mittee on organization representing the principal subjects of study and the prin cipal universities This committee under the chairmanship of Professor Dewey after prolonged discussion decided that SCIENCE 153N S VOL XLI No 1048 it would not attempt to define the condi tions of eligibility for membership but that invitations to join in the formal organiza tion of the association should be sent to persons of full professorial rank whose names appeared on the lists of distin guished specialists prepared for the com mittee in each of the principal subjects provided that such professors were con nected with institutions having five or more names upon these lists Some 650 of those to whom these invitations were sent have thus far expressed their sympathy with the general purposes formulated in the circu lar of the committee on organization and their purpose to adhere to the association In accordance with the action above re ported members of the university teaching profession who did not receive invitations to the New York meeting and who desire to become members of the Association are asked to signify that desire to any of their colleagues who are already charter mem bers or who may become such during the period allowed for that purposethe first three months of the present year A 0 LOVEJOY Secretary JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY THE AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE SAFETY ENGINEERING1 THE

Advancement of Science Philadelphia Decem ber 31 1914 tention to the field of safety engineering and I bring to your attention some phases of this work This portion of the field of engineering can not be said to involve any radically new fact or discovery but to be rather a new grouping of interests as a re sult of a change of accent among the many industrial factors In developing any engi neering design there is usually a compro mise between prime factors which dominate the result and minor factors which receive less accent so also in industrial life such prime factors as production cost profits expansion etc have heretofore received the greater accent while the item of safety of the employee and the public which has always been a factor in design and in man agement has oftentimes been given rela tively small weight There is a rapidly growing feeling that every industry should receive its workers each day in fit condi tion and should return them to their homes whole and in like fit condition Strong ac cent is now being given to this idea which has resulted in a movement of very con siderable momentum and this change in accent is finding its expression in various legislation in workmens compensation acts in the whole safety movement includ ing the work of safety engineering Safety engineering has for its object the eliminar tion of industrial accidents While the re sult of such an accident was borne largely by the injured individual the prevention of accidents remained more or less of a minor factor in industrial problems but as the industry is required to carry directly a larger share of the burden resulting from accident the problem has become one of prime importance Each engineer me chanical electrical civil and mining is now asked to view his work from a new angle Guards guides and protective devices are added where it was perfectly evident these devices should have been before but it be 154 SCIENCE

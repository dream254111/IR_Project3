systematic botany in many cases where the chief end of the study seems to be to enable the student to find out the technical name of the plant A paper by Prof T J Burrill of Illinois upon  An experiment in silkculture came next upon the programme The experiment was but very partially successful as regards the production of silk the larger part of the worms dying of a contagious disease at about the time when they should have formed co coons The investigation of this disease formed the main subject of the paper The disease was identi fied by the author and by Professor Forbes with the Jlacherie of Pasteur and was plainly not the disease which he describes under the name pebrine It also ap pears to be identical with a disease which has lately proved very fatal to the larvae of the cabbage butterfly The writer was not aware that any one had previ ously positively determined the existence of true ftacherie or of pebrine in America but if the con clusions of his paper were correct the former at least has in all probability long existed here un recognized In remarking upon the above papers Prof C V Riley claimed that both these diseases of the silk worm had been recognized by entomologists in this country though they had not been able to give the disease that careful microscopical and bacteriological study which Professors Burrill and Forbes had done lie also stated his belief that the germs of flacherie are omnipresent and that the disease may be in duced at any time by unsanitary conditions A paper followed by Miajor Ienry E Alvord of New York upon  Telemetric aid to meteorological records describing briefly an apparatus made by the Telethernomneter company of NewYork city by which a continuous record of temperature can be obtained at any reasonable distance from the place of observation and with very little trouble The re sults of about six months comparison of one of these instruments with thirteen daily readings of a standard mercurial thermometer showed a toler ably close agreement between the two The tele thermometer was slightly tardy in its changes and usually failed markedly to reach the minimum daily temperature and frequently fell a little short of the maximum The author considered itthough by no means perfect  to be the best aid yet found for recording atmospheric temperatures in connection with agricultural studies The next paper was by Prof I P Armsby of Wis consin upon  The creaming of milk by the Cooley system It was chiefly statistical giving the results of some two hundred and fifty experiments in creaming the milk of single cans by this system and showing that in eleven hours 9099 per cent of the fat of the milk was recovered in the cream as against 7580 per cent in some recently reported German experiments in which the temperature of the water surrounding the cans of milk was much higher The experiments furnished also some hints as to further investigations upon the NCE VOL VI No 135 influence of small variations of temperature upon the process but no definite conclusions A paper by Prof G C Caldwell of New York upon The lactobutyrometer consisted chiefly of a review of the tests of this instrument on record but con tained also some experiments as to the cause of the failure of the process in certain cases to extract even approximately all the fat from milk particularly that from highlyfed cows The author concludes that his experiments are at least not inconsistent with the belief that either an albuminous envelope or some sort of an accumulation of albuminoid matter about the fat globules gives rise to the difficulty A brief report by Prof W J Beal upon the prog ress of experiments on the vitality of buried seeds and a short account by Prof C V Riley of a new remedy for locusts which has been successfully used in California and the reading by title of a paper by Prof E W Hilgard  On some redeeming traits of alkali soils closed the reading of papers At the business meeting the

EYE IN a recent paper before the Philadelphia academy Dr Benjamin Sharp has endeavored to trace the de velopment of the highly complex vertebrate eye from the simplest deposit of pigment in an epithelial cell The simplest organ of vision is found in the Lamelli branchiata but these are not the primitive organs of the group the ancestral eyes being present in a few forms for a short time during the free larva stage The most primitive adult eyes are found in the common oyster in which the free edge of the mantle is lined with a numbei   of epithelial cells fig 1 havinE f i  is a

illustrated in the com mon Venus in which the eye are confined to the most exposed part of the body the socalled siphon So  far there has been no protection to the visual organs other than that afforded by the shell but in Venus the fact that there are pigment cells at the base as well as on the extremities of the tentacles indicates a change soon o take place This change is well T shown in

and with only one or two exceptions there is but a single pair of eyes In Patella the row of eyes last seen in Solen has become a simple sphere of pigmented cells and in Haliotis we have also an open sphere but instead of the refractive cuticula in front of each cell there is one combined mass forming a lens which is purely a secretion not cellu lar as in vertebrates Fissurella goes practically as far as any gastropod having a closed eye containing a lens and a transparent epidermal covering acting as a cornea Both Fissurella and Haliotis have a distinct nerve specialized for sight which connects the eye with the superior cephalic ganglion In an early stage of the vertebrate embryo the ante rior medullary groove divides into three segments  the fore mid and hind brain The forebrain sends outwards and laterally a swelling which increases in size and passes on to the epidermis and here an invagination takes place to meet this outward brain growth This invagination finally closes and soon becomes cut off forming a hollow vesicle the cavity of which is finally obliterated and becoming trans parent forms the lens of the adult eye In the mean time the growth  from the brain has arched over and above this vesi i cle and then folding  over laterally it encloses the lens fig 3 which e fills up the anterior open FIG 3DIiagramto illustrate ing of the cavity of this the method by

b there is a doublewalled vesicle the interior wall giving rise to the many layered retina while the external wall forms the pigment layer of the cho roidea The evolution of this eye seems simple for as soon as it became of importance to its possessor a corre sponding stimulation took place in the brain where sight is without doubt seated An increase of devel opment began all along the tract from the lens to the brain and as this increased that part of the brain nearest the eye enlarged and proceeded by steps out ward in a manner similar to the process now taking place in the development of the eyes of Vertebrata We then have a stage in which a part of the brain closes over the superior part of the eye being sepa rated by a layer of fibres which is the much shortened and flattened primitive optic nerve The pedicle connecting this advanced part of the brain which may be looked upon as a ganglion will now be called the  secondary optic nerve  the optic nerve of the eyes of the adult Vertebrata Dr Sharp thus holds 1 that the lens of the vertebrate eye is homologous with a primitive invaginated eye such as we find today in the gasteropods 2 that the layer of optic fibres of the retina is homologous with the primitive optic nerve In vertebrates as well as invertebrates we frequently NCE 195 find blind animals the near relatives of which have welldeveloped organs of sight In these cases the accessory organs are first to disappear the lens first and in the lowest forms of degeneration Branchi ostoma notably nothing remains but a slight deposit of pigment on the anterior end of the neural canal This deposit in Branchiostoma and a similar deposit in some larval Ascidia have led Lankester to regard the primitive type of Vertebrata as a transparent ani mal with eyes sessile in the brain but Dr Sharps investigations have led him to the opinion that forms so degenerate as these should not be taken as a stand ard on which to base our conclusions in regard to the origin of the vertebrates C1VILIZA TION AND EYESIGHT THE discussion following Lord Rayleighs article upon Civilization and eyesight Nature No 798 p 340 has resulted in a clear exposition of this in teresting subject Rayleigh is of the opinion that the supposed superiority of the savage eye is merely a question of attention and practice in the interpreta tion of minute indications and that it is comparable with the acuteness of the blind in drawing con clusions from slender acoustical premises It is doubtful whether the blind can hear sounds wholly inaudible to others and likewise it seems impossi ble for the savage eye with practically the same aper ture as the civilized eye to resolve objects beyond a certain point calculable by the laws of optics from the wavelength of light J Rand Capron Nature No 799 p 359 suggests that in considering the question of aperture the fact that this though probably following a general rule applicable alike to savages and civilized beings varies in individual cases should be taken into account He mentions an assistant who had a singularly sharp eye and could pick out with ease companions to double stars small satellites etc which others saw with difficulty The pupils of his eyes were always larger than those of most other persons and he had the peculiar power of being able to read fine print with ease when the gas was turned half on and it was his habitual custom to read in this way He sug gests that there must be something more than a mere question of attention and interpretation of minute details when a savage can resolve two distant dots into distinctly appreciable personages as regards sex and garments R Brudenell Carter urges Nature No 800 p 386 that there is no necessity for a larger aperture to ex plain acuteness of vision The savage might have greater sensitiveness to variations of light greater sensitiveness to color and acuteness of vision over a larger retinal area All these advantages might be conferred by better formation or higher development of the retina and such higher development might at once be promoted by exercise and handed down by descent He believes that the conditions of townlife are unfavorable to the evolution and favorable to the degradation of the eye and further that a mod

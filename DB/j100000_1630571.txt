The vieepresident s address was deliv ered by Professor Clarenee A Waldo pro fessor of mathematies at Purdue Univer sity Ijafayette Ind on the subjeet of Engineering and Mathematies  It was a statement of the great influenee of the engineering Golleges upon the teaGhing of mathematies and was a strong plea for the rationalization of mathematies and espe eially or engineering students and also for illustrating the reality of mathematieal formul and expressions by examples drawn from engineering praetise By this means it will be found that the student will per teive the utility of mathematital applita tions earlier in his eourse and will not be studying the subjeet for reasons of either blind faith or stolid obedienee As the paper has already been published in the eolumns of SCIENCE we gladly refer the reader to the address itself EXCURSIONS The seetion met for the presentation and diseussion of papers Qn Tuesday Wednes day and Thursday mornings and on Wednesday evening Tuesday afternoon was spent in an exeursion under the aus piees of the St Ijouis Engineers Club to the Eads Bridge7 and by speeial train to the Union Station to inspeet the ehanges now being made in its terminal fatilities The members of the seetion availed them selves of the kind invitation of the man agers of the IJouisiana Purehase Exposi tion and visited the exposition grounds on Thursday afternoon where after luneheon they inspeeted the extensive bulldings and grounds and the maGhinery whieh was be ing installed PAPERS Professor A S Ijangsdorf of Washing ton University presented a paper giving  Graphie Methods for Determining the Equations of Experimental Curves  and giving means for fixing upon the type of equation to be used and of evaluating the eonstants of an equation whieh represents a eurve found experimentally Parabolie hyperbolie logarithmie and periodie eurves are treated by his method The paper will probably be published in the Journal of the Associatio of Engieering FoctetiesSGIENCE 363 MARaH 4 1904 Professor J IJ Van Ornum of Wash ington University St Ijouis Mo described the results of his experiments on The Fa tigue of Cement Produets In his experi ments he made tests of eubes and prisms of neat Portland eement and of Gonerete ap plying different loads at the rate of about four times per minute until rupture en sued and plotting a eurve of results show ing the number of repetitions neeessary to eause rupture when the load was a given per eent of the ultimate statie strength The results of the tests of eubes of neat eement show that repeated loads less in intensity than the ultimate strength of the material will eause failure The number of repetitions neeessary to produee this ef feet inereases very rapidly for loads less than 65 per eent of the ultimate strength and seems to beGome infinite at about 50 per eent value For example 180 repeti tions of the load of 80 per cent of the ulti mate statie strength are suffieient to eause rupture Four hundred repetitions of the 70 per eent load or 1000 repetitions of the 62 per eent load or 1700 repetitions of the 60 per eent load or 4000 repetitions of the 56 per eent load or 5000 repetitions of the 55t per eent load will do the same The same general law applies equally to conerete The above results with eement and conerete are therefore similar to those obtained by Woehler on iron and steel The modulus of elastiGity of eement and conerete is greatly redueed in value under the influenee of repeated loads of the in tensities indiGated Prisms 5 X 5 X 12 high were used in this work The paper will be printed in T7we Trarwsacttorbs of the Antertcan Soctety of Ctvtl Erbgtrweers A paper on  The Design of Steel Conerete Arehes by Professor E J MeCaustland of Cornell University Ithaea N Y was read inhis absenee by his Golleague Pro fessor H S Jaeoby The author ealls at tention to the laGk of eleaneut definite knowledge as to the aetion of steel Gom bined with Gonerete under stress and parF tieularly in an areh ring subjeet to moving loads and states that arehes are built with faetors of safety ranging probably all the way from 3 to 150 He is of the opinion that we do not so muGh need new theories as we do an extension of our praetiGal knowledge of the meehaniGal properties of Gonerete He gives an abstraet and dis eusses a graduating thesis on the subjeet by Mr W S Edge After briefly stating the theory whiGh formed the basis of the investigation and deseribing the details thereof he summarizes Mr Edge s Gon elusions as follows 1 that the graphie method of solution is as aeGurate as is justified by our knowledge of safe unit stresses in Gonerete 2 that an areh ring designed for thrusts due to uniform live loading will be too thin at the haunehes to resist stresses due to eeeentric loads 3 that in large spans it is more acGurate to use Cain s method of sub dividing the areh ring sinee it gives in general results for thrusts whiGh are about two per eent greater than will be given by dividing the areh into equal horizontal see tions 4 it is better not to try to uske a mowdified semiellipse for an earthfilled areh when the rise is less than one sixth or pos sibly one eighth of the span as the equi librium eurve flaRttens it too muGh at the haunches It is better to take full advan tage of the rise by making the areh linear from crown to springing thereby redueing the erown thrust 5 The maximum bend ing moment is not produeed by a live load Govering one half of the bridge For the erown seetion the bending moment is the greatest when the load is about three fifths on the bridge The greatest positive mo ment however oGeurs with the areh prae tioally one half loaded The greatest nega tive momenttoGeurs when the areh is three fifths loaded As the result of designing364 SCIENCE N S VOL XIX No479 about fifteen arehes Mr Edge suggests a method of proGedure whiGh he has found tto be the most simple and hopes that some one else will be interested in estending the investigations The paper will probably be published in the Trasacttoxs of the Atnertcan Soctety of Ctvtl Egeers Professor Henry S Jaeoby then gave an aeGount of  The New Features and Tenden cies in Bridge Engineering whiGh he had observed in his very extensive bridge in speetion tours whiGh he has had the priv ilege of taking during the sabbatiGal period whiGh was granted to him by Cornell Uni versity He noted the inerease in the use of plate girders up to those of 128 feet 4 inehes from eenter to eenter of supports that the present tendeney in railroad bridge Gonstruetion seemed to be to get rid so far as possible of the overhead portions of bridges that riveted trusses were now built in spans up to 230 feet that the length of panels had now been inereased to 37 feet and mentioned bridges over the Monongahela and Allegheny Rivers of the Pratt type with eurved upper ehords having only 11 panels in 417foot spans The maximum span of simple trusses is still the same as it was ten years ago the reGord being held by the Ijouisville bridge of 546 feet 6 inehes The Pratt truss seems to be in the aseendeney in both riveted and pin Gonstruetion The author stated that the majority of the masonry now being Gon strueted by the railroads with one notable exGeption is of Gonerete and that Gonerete arch bridges had been built with spans up to 130 feet Professor Jaeoby has evidently improved his opportunities during the past year and his work as an instruetor must of necessity be correspondingly benefited by the opportunities whiGh he has aeeepted for studying bridges in the drawingroom in the shop in the field and in use The next two papers presented were from the Ohio State University at Columbus Ohio The first one was by Professor Wm T Magruder and deseribed An Hydraulie Mierometer Caliper whiGh was presented for inspeetion to the seetion This ealiper Gonsists of a bronze graduated eirele sixteen inehes in diameter whiGh is seGured to the end of a hydraulie drum Gonneeted to a standpipe and so that it ean be rotated around its axis Crossserews both radial and axial are earried by the revolving ring so that pointers fixed in the ends of the axial serews ean be brought into Gontaet with the surfaGe of a jet of water issuing from the orifiee and so that by rneans of a seale on the serews all the Goordinates of the jet ean be obtained for a distanee of six inehes or more from the entranee to the orifiee Professor James E Boyd and Professor HoraGe Judd presented a paper deseribing and giving the results of their experiments with  Pitot Tubes  and on  The Experi mental Determinations of the Forms of Water Jets  The paper deseribes  a Pitot tube as a simple Gontrivanee for measuring the veloeity of water It Gonsists of a small tube plaGed in the strearn so that the water strikes fairly against one end Some dis tanee frorn the end it is bent and Gonneeted to a vertiGal glass tube The eurrent striking against the end produees a pres sure whiGh is measured by the height to whiGh water rises in the glass tube or in ease of high pressures by a gauge of some sort Pitot elaimed that this height was equal to the distanee a body rnust fall to acquire a veloeity equal to that of the stream IJater observers have thought that this is ineorreet and that the water rose rnuGh higher These experiments were with jets and showed that Pitot was prae tiGally Gorreet Ineidentally it was found that the Gontraeted vein in a jet of water from an orifiee in a thin plate is about 785 of the diarneter of the orifieen and that the veloeity of suGh a jet is over 99 per eentSCIENCE  365 MARCII 4 1904 of the theoretiGal veloeity The paper de seribes experiments to determine the con stants of Pitot tubes Tubes with variously formed tips and of inside diameters ranging from 162 inch to 007 inch were placed in the jet from an orifiee in a thin plate Each tube gave a pressure practically the same as that in the drum from which the water was flowing No change was ob served when the tubes were moved back and forth along the axis of the jet the inerease of static pressure back of the plane of the orifiee exactly compensating for the dim inution of velocity pressure To determine the velocity of the jet measurements were taken of the coeffieient of contraction the coeffieient of discharge and of the relative velocities at different distances from the axis of the jet The mean velocity from a twoinch orifiee was found to differ from that in the center by less than 0002 The coeffieients were veloeities tnust be supposed arranged ae cording to the law of probabilities  Sup pose a number of small elastic spheres of equal malss moving in all directions with equal velocities and consider two of them moving at right angles to each other and so that sphere B strikes sphere A at the instant that the center of A crosses the path of B the velocity of A in the direction of Bs motion is zero and therefore all of Bs motion will be transferred to A This will inerease the velocity of A from v to t 2 Evidently another rectangular blow from a sphere C would inerease this velocity tob vv 3 and so on so that we have in this a proof that an equal distribution of veloGi ties would not be a permanent one and that the final permanent distribution must depend upon the possibilities of the various phases of collision that may oGeur Professor G W Bissell of Iowa State College Ames Iowa presented a paper on  Iowa Coals  He stated that the Iowa coal fields have an area of 20000 square miles and inelude the southwest one third of the state The Des Moines valley mines are the most active In this distriet coal is found at depths of from 100 to 300 feet in veins from 18 inches thick and upwards The thinner veins are profitably worked in conjunetion with the manufacture of brick and other elay products made from the coal shales Iowa coals are mostly bituminous and noncoking The average

all parts of a section the figures for the coefScient of velocity reprelsent the ton stants of the Pitot tubes which give read ings equal to the static pressure behind the orifiees Similar measurements were made with a short pipe from which the coeffieient of the Pitot was found to be 993 The hydraulic mierometer caliper deseribed in the preceding paper was used in making the above measurements ProMessor J Burkitt Webb of Stevens Institute Hoboken N J presented a paper on Molecular Velocities in which he ofZered a simple illustration in sup port of Maxwell s theory that the only permanent state for the molecules is one in which the velocities are not the same for all molecules but that all possible Moisture  Fixed carbon  Volatile  Ash  Sulphur  808 4560 3814 818 10000 342 The calorifie power of Iowa coals as de termined at Iowa State College with the Parr calorimeter ranges from 9180 to 13141 with an average of 11780 B T U per pound of ovendried coal From a366 SCIENCE N 8 VOL XIX N0479 number of proximate analyses of Iowa eoals and from determinations of their calorie value by means of the Parr calor imeter he deduced the formula that the calorie value of an Iowa

showing the pro hibitive price of anthracite and that the fuel cost of generating steam with slack coal is from 30 to 40 per tent less than the fuel cost with lump nut or steam coal in the same mine oughly 6 that the people of each com munity must see to it that they are pro tected from this evil as from poor drainage and dirty streets Professor William T Magruder of Ohio State University Columbus Ohio pre sented a paper entitled A Produter Horse Power A Proposed New Unit  After reviewing Watts unit for a boiler horse power7 and that adopted by the Philadel phia Centennial Commission he stated that the rapid introduction of the use of gas engines using blastfurnace gas or producer gas leads to the suggestion of a unit for the horse power of a gas producer similar to the unit for the horse power of a boiler As some gas engines are now delivering a brake horse power for the generation of 10000 BT U per hour and a few are doing 10 to 15 per cent better than this he suggested as a proposed new unit that of a produter horse power  He defined it as the generation in an hour of suffieient gas at 60 F to produce 10000 B T U when burned to water and gas at 60 F or its equivalent  Before availing iteself of the invitation of the St IJouis Engineers Club the seetion listened to a paper by Mr A P Greens felder assistant engineer of the Terminal Railroad Assoeiation of St IJouis on Re cent Improvements at the Union Station at St IJouis The paper was illustrated by the plans for the improvements which are now under way showed the necessity for them for handling the passenger and freight business of St IJouis and deseribed in some detail the methods which had been adopted for changing the tracks and mov ing all the express company buildings while operating over 1100

Professor C H Benjamin of the Case School of Applied Science Cleveland Ohio on  The Science of Smoke Prevention  As Professor Benjamin was for several years the engineering expert in enforeing the ordinance against smoke production in Cleveland his conelusions are the result of both scientifie attainment and practical experience in dealing with the smoke ques tion in eities They are as follows 1 That objectionable smoke from soft coal can readily be prevented 2 that such preven tion will result in a higher eeieney and smaller fuel bills 3 that all new plants should be subject to permits issued by proper eity offieials 4 that educational and legal measures combined should be used in cases where the evil already exists 5 that the control of such work should be in the hands of properly trained engineers who understand the whole subject thorSCIENCE 367 MARCH 4 1904 St Ijouis Worlds Fair Allthree gentle men are members of the committee havillg the subject in charge Professor Wood ward introduced the subject Mr Rotch deseribed and illustrated with the lantern the most suecessful dirigible balloons and flying machines some of which are likely to be tried at St Ijouis anddiscussed the regulations for these experiments as drawn up by the committee Mr Smith con tinued the subject discussing it in detail and deseribing the facilities whith would be oSered to contestants for inflating their balloons with hydrogen gas 97 per cent pure made by a new English process which is guaranteed to deliver 25000 cubic feet of hydrogen for the combustion of one ton of slack coal The method of genera tion it was stated will consist of the dis soeiation of steam by ineandeseent iron shavings and the revivifieation of the oxide of iron so formed by produter gas The last paper of the morning was by Mr Oetave Chanute on  Aerial Naviga tion  and was a laost able one After call ing attention to two probable solutions of the problem he deseribed what has been ateomplished with balloons and flying ma  chines the evolution and limitations of such apparatus their limited uses and dis cussed the prospect of any one winning the prize oSered by the Worlds Fair Commis sion It is published in the March Popular Sctence Monthly The series of papers be ing by noted specialists of high scientifie attainments were greatly enjoyed by all those who availed themselves of the priv ilege of hearing them THoE HYDROLOGY OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER The Wednesday evening program in eluded in its scope the entire Mississippi River Valley beginning with a paper by Professor C W lIall ofthe University of Minnesota at Minneapolis Minn on The Stream Flow  of the Upper Mississippi AERONAUTICS The program for Wednesday morning was made up of a series of papers on prob lems connected with aeronauties Pro fessor J Burkitt Webb of Stevens Insti tute Hoboken N J presented two papers One was on  The Flying Machine Problem  in which he showed among other things that or rapid flight a considerable altitude is favorable The second one was on Prat tical ArtilScial Flight  The author stated that the inventor should aim for the most practical results and should attack the main difficulties at the start To this end he suggested that the question of motive power be eliminated and that power be supplied from a trolley or from an overhead souree and that the endeavor should be to develop a machine whith can slowly and surely rise from the ground and as slowly and safely deseend again and which should be con trolled by an automatic balanting device Mr A Ijawrenee Rotch director of the Blue Hill BIeteorological Observatory Hyde Park Mass read a most interesting paper which was illustrated by the stereopticon deseriptive of the Exploration of the At mosphere as Practised with Kites at the Blue Hill Observatory since 1894  The methods employed and the results obtained are in part deseribed in the appendix of the Smithsonian Report of 1900 and the later technical details will be published in the Anals of Earvard College Observa tory Part III of Volume XTjTTI  The Aeronautical  Contests at the NVorlds Flair St9 IJouis 1904 were out lined and discussed in three papers pre sented by Professor Calvin M Woodward Washington University St Ijouis Mo Mr A Ijawrence Rotch director of Blue Hill Meteorological Observatory Hyde Park Mass and Mr Willard A Smith chief of the transportation exhibits and in tharge of the Department ofAeronauties of the368 SCIENCE N S VOL XIX NO 479 River and ending with a paper by Mr 3ames A Seddon of St Ijouis on  The Ijower Mississippi River  Professor Halls paper was illustrated by a number of lantern slides showing the headwaters of the Mississippi the geolog ical formations of the valley and a study of the currents and the flow of the waters of the river A paper by Judge R S Taylor of Ft Wayne Ind a member of the Mississippi River Commission was then read on IJev ees Outlets and Reservoirs  He stated that the alluvial valley of the river below Cairo contains 29790 square miles of lands subject to overflow in its natural state that it is all capable of protection and reelama tion by levees which has been going on for nearly 200 years except a small area at the foot of each drainage basin which has to be left open for the eseape of surface drain age The existing lines of levees are about 1350 miles long and about 80 miles remain to be constructed to complete in length the main river system In few plates how ever are the embankments as high and as strong as they should be for the greatest safety  The potential high water of floods to come has been the subject of much study and discussion The nearest approach to a standard has been that the levee should be three feet above the highest previous flood line in that locality The flood of 1897 made 38 crevasses having an aggregate wldth of about 8 miles the flood of 1903 made 9 crevasses having an aggregate width of about 3 miles The levees in place in 1903 if no crevasses had breached them would have protected about 26000 square miles from overflow Of that area a total of about 3000 square miles was overflowed in consequence of the crevasses which took plaee which is less than one eighth of the entire area whith the existing levees could ai would have protected if they had all been high enough and had held their places In the phrase of the targetshooters they accomplished 87 per cent of suecess out of a possible 100 The levee system is at this moment in the very crisis of its history It has demonstrated the possibility of its useful ness It wants just the last grand effort to carry it to completion We ought not to think of the diversion of any part of our resourees to any other work while that re nains unfinished During the flood of 1903 the existing levees protected from overflow seven eighths of all the lands capable of protection If great floods should come once in five years and weK should never do any better than we did last spring this would mean that there would be an average annual inundation of 2 acres out of every 100 acres This would seem to show that the present sys tem of levees is suecessful The author does not believe in the suecessful protection by outlets and reservoirs and paid their advocates the compliment of a polite refu tation of their arguments The paper will be published by the Werner Co Akronr Ohio He was followed by Professor Ijewis M Haupt of Philadelphia Pa who referred to the law of 1879 and to reports of the Board of Engineers  He quoted the reso lution of congress of 1891 that no portion of the appropriation then made should be expended to repair or build levees for the purpose of reelaiming land but only when it may afford ease and safety to the naviga tion and commeree of the river and deepen the channel He stated that it was shownJ by a comparison of surveys made at art interval of twelve years that the bed had risen about four feet and that the banks above low water had caved in to a large ex tent He urged that the law be amended so as to provide for specifie appropriations for levees to protect the waste and swamp lands which he elaimed were quiX as deSCIENCE 369 MARaiI 4 1904 serving of national aid as the arid lands of the plains He advocated a more thorough system of drainage by the removal of the obstaeles and bars in the seetion below Red River He distussed the statements made as to the effect of trevasses showing from surveys that they are of great benefit in reducing the flood stages and improving navigation as well as in adding extensive tracts to the arable lands of the state and nation By removing a large pereentage of silt from the river they also retard the gulfward movement of the bars and flatter slopes whith contribute to flood heights By the natural process of hy draulit grading not less than 150 square miles have been deposited above the gulf level within thirty years To have filled this up by dredges at ten cents per yard would have cost 1500 per acre which would have been prohibitory He also dwelt on the need of removing bars from the front of all passes by a curved form of jetty simulating and applying the action of all streams in treating the deepwater pools found in their coneave bends Thus vessels could freely navigate all the passes while at the same time the floods would be lowered and the sediment be deposited on the opposite or convex bank Colonel J A Ockerson of St Ilouis with the aid of stereopticon illustrations deseribed the work of the Mississippi River Commission o which he is a member He discussed some of the physical character isties of the river and the subjects of flood control and thannel improvement and showed seenes along the river frodn its souree to its mouth ineluding the levees and levee building crevasses and the hy draulic dredges used in the thannels and the methods of removing obstructions to navigation The last paper of the evening was on  The IJower Mississippi River  by Mr James A Seddon of St IJouis Mo He stated that the word river is a geograph ical and not a physical term That unlike the tidal rivers the Mississippi is a power that has made its valley and is master of it The great flood has more than ten times the power of Niagara in its flow to the gulf He discussed in considerable detail the physical conformation of the valley showed that the river has an eseess of power to earry its sediment and stated that the only plate where the Mississippi River has formed a bar by dropping this sediment is where it meets the waters of the gulf At the mouth the flow can no longer carry its sediment as it is too weak In the valley the flow is too strong and it chokes itself up and spreads out in shallows He dis cussed the subject of dykes and bank pro tection and gave many interesting facts concerning levee history The author is in favor of a reservoir system of protection and stated that this would give the bottom lands a tertain flood protection while emptying the reservoirs at the time of low water in the river would triple its depth and the cost of the work of reser voir construction would have been a little more than half of the 80000000 whiah has been spent on the lower Mississippi By this means the river would become a deep waterway whith would not stop at the Ohio River but continuing up the Illi nois River through the Chicago drainage canal would join the lake and gulf com merce He is of the opinion that what is most needed in this case is a statesman to see that the river and harbor bill carries a responsibility that will produce results with its expenditure This series of papers gave as coznplete a resume of the subject as the time allotteci would permit and showed what a wide di versity of olpinion there is alnong scientifie experts on this extremely important prob lem in eivil engineering and hydraulies The Thursday morning program was as370 SCIENCE CN S VOL XIX NO 479 usual well filled with several papers which had been left over from Tuesday and with the remaining papers of the program One of these was by Professor Frank B Will iams of Union College Seheneetady N Y on Methods of Determining the Coeffi eients of

rock extends across the isthlnus that it is very uniforln strong and in every way suited for tunnel ing Tested at the Watertown Arsenal it was found to be stronger than Quiney granite Analyzed at the geological labora tory at Washington it was found that hornblende predominated in the granite The canaltunnel will be a straight line from sea to sea and therefore capable of passing a ship of any length The paper distussed the elements of the erossseetion of the tunnel the method for its eonstrue tion using three headings and understoped as well as open benches and nine overhead traeks to remove the debris and it is stated that the 18000000 eubic yards in the tun nel and the 37000000 eubic yards of ex eavation outside the tunnel can all be made for less than 100000000 It is estimated that the work can be completed in two years although three years have been al lowed Considering its good geological position the excellence of the harbors available the abundant supply of water at sealevel no locks to delay passage of shipping and more than ten times the capacity for busi ness as compared with any other proposed isthmian canal it would be cheap at three or four times the cost to say nothing of the short time which will be required to build it Before adjourning on Thursday to enjoy the hospitality of the offieers of the World s Fair the section had the privilege of listen ing to Ijieutenant G I Carden U S Rev enue Cutter Service on 8ome Topies Con nected with the Machinery Department of the World s Fair  The author is superin tendent of  arsenal tools  in the depart ment of machinery at the fair and was sent abroad and secured many of the for eign exhibits of maehinery The section chose Professor David S Jaeobus of Stevens Institute Hoboken N J as its vicepresident for the next meet ing and on nomination to the general committee he was duly eleeted To say the least the program of Seetion D was very full A large number of the papers were by the leading experts of the eountry on the subjeets discussed It is questionable whether the interests of sei enee are the better advanced by permitting a more lengthy and general diseussion of the papers presented than by having theSCIENCE 371 MAROH 4 1904 other sides of the saxne subject formally presented by some one who may not fully agree with the preceding author but who has had time to prepare a written paper defending his position and advocating his opinions While persons may  dilcEer in their opinions as to which is thebetter planj the consensus of opinion of the members present was that the program presented gave them much information and food for thought Many branches of mechanical science and engineering were touched upon and while special emphasis was put upon those sessions devoted to aeronauties and hydrology it was thought that the place and its surroundings warranted it The attendance at the meetings of the section has been excelled in recent years only by the 19023 Washington meeting It is thought that this is encouraging for the future of the section It is to be hoped that the members of the association con nected with the section will show their con tinued interest in it by their attendance and by presenting papers at future meet ings WM T MAGRUDER Secretary A REPLY TO RECENT STRlaTURES ON AMERICAN BIOLOGISTS A NOT uneommon though possibly more or less indefinitely formulated opinion has recently found an expression in printt to the effect that American systematic zoology has degenerated into a mere recording of minute facts instead of being a study of problems in other words that it has been redueed to a somewhat lowlevel though possibly sometimes useful craft and has lost easte among the sciences It must be admitted at the outset that  Read at the Twentyfirst Congress of the American Ornithologists Union at its meeting in Philadelphia November 18 1903 t Talcott Williams  On the Skilmish Line of Science 3ooAclovers Magazine II November 1903 p 458 this trititism is deserved to a limited ex tent If we take ornithology as an example what are the results of our labors in this country Ijook over the long files of the Auk and see what they contain An as tounding and in lnany ways admirable record of facts relating to the distribution of our birds their habits their specifia and subspecifie tharacters  The refine ment and acumen of diserimination with regard to the latter have reached a high degree of development and it is doubtless true that the birds of North America are better known than those of any other part of the globe of even approximately similar extent Our collections of native species are vastly larger and more complete than those of any other country and our methods and technique both of collecting and of recording greatly superior to those of the rest of the world And the work goes on unceasingly and the details are being more skilfully and accurately and voluminously elaborated every day In fact we are working so fast and so well that we have left the rest of the ornithological world far behind Some of the younger Euro pean ornithologists are trying to catch up but they will never be able to do so beeause the North American material can only be had here and because we have gained such a lead in the race But for what purpose are we ateumu lating all this minute detail this enormous material  What are we straining our best fatulties our aeknowledged ingeniousness for Thus far we have but little to show that would give a satisfying answer to these questions On the surface at least it looks as if we were following these pur suits chiefly for their own sake for the satisfaction of mere aecumulating for the exereise of these mental fatulties To the outsider it must tertainly appear as if we regard the work we are doing as an end not as a means towards an end The ques

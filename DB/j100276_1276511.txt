State v Bristow 131 la 664 io9 N W 199 In the last named case the legislature had sought to bring itinerant vendors selling by samples or taking orders whether for immediate or future delivery under the operation of a statute regulating peddlers A tea company salesman like the one in the principal case was held not to be a peddler under that statute it was held that a peddler and an itinerant vendor selling from samples or taking or ders for present or future delivery are not the same in spite of the legislative enactment This case seems to be followed in the principal case The words of the ordinance in question in defining hawkers seem to be broad enough and fairly easy of application but the court decided that defendant was not a hawker not by applying the definitions laid down in the ordinance itself but by authority aliunde It has been held that in the absence of statutory definition the determination of whether a person is a peddler or not depends upon the circumstances of each case and not upon any arbitrary rules Com monwealth v Edson 2 Pa Co Ct R 377 Whether it is a coincidence or a result of the nature of the business the large majority of defendants in recent

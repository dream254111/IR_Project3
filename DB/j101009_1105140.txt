Communications should be addressed to the PUBLISHERS We publish in this number the new Rules of Practice for the Courts of Equity of the United States with ah article on the same by a learned Virginia lawyer A care The New Federal ful perusal of these rules makes it evident Equity Rules that the influence of the English Rules in Equity has had decided weight in some re spects The Equity Courts in England nearly all meet in the city of London and England is a country with a network of railroads so that approach to the capital city is quite easy In addition to this the Chancery Court is practically in session all the year with the exception of wellknown and fixed vacations Access to the Judge and Courts is therefore very easy But in most of the states of this Union our Federal Courts are migratory and the judges sit in places far removed from the judges place of resi dence and the length of terms is exceedingly uncertain The result of this must be that some of the rules will cause great in convenience Amongst these we might mention Rule No 6 re quiring the District Court to establish regular times and places not less than one each month when motions requiring notice and hearing may be made and disposed of Now is a large city or a district in which access is easy to the judge and office this rule can work no hardship But take the Western District of Vir ginia for instance where the judge holds terms in Lynchburg his residenceDanville Harrisonburg Abingdon Charlottesville and Big Stone Gap Some of these places are hard of access and a long way from each other Length of terms varies At one place the judge may have to sit for several weeks at another only a few days It will be almost impossible for him to fix a regular time and place each month to hear motions etc He may fix say the first Monday in each month in Lynchburg as likely as not his court in Big Stone Gap several hundred miles away may have arush of business and run over beyond the day fixed And this is likely to occur at any place Then this obliges the judge prac tically to be in place at a fixed place once a month cutting his vacation time in summer down to a month at the most Then the requirement that testimony of witnesses shall be taken orally in open court in all trials in equity as provided in Rule 46 will lengthen terms and cause much inconvenience to counsel and witnesses The latter will be compelled to dance attendance on the court for many days for no one can tell with any certainty what day the case in which they are called will be reached and they can take no risks Rule 47 will doubtless mitigate the hard ship of Rule 46 as it allows depositions to be taken upon the application of either party when allowed by statute or for good and exceptional cause for departing from the general rule We have no doubt that the argument ab inconvenienti will often be used as good and exceptional cause the exception be the rule Of course as these new rules are used amendments will suggest themselves and rough edges be smoothed The case of Elliott v The Atlantic Coast Line decided by the Supreme Court of South Carolina October 2 1912 75 South eastern Reporter page 886 is of de Interstate Commerce cided interest in more respects than What Law Governs one The main question in the case was as to the rule governing a ship ment of property from one state to another where a contract had been entered into limiting the liability of the carrier In this case a cargo of horses and mules was shipped from Norfolk Vir ginia to Dillon South Carolina In consideration of a reduced freight rate granted by the railroad the shipper in the bill of lad ing agreed and contracted with the defendant that in case of loss or damage to any of the horses or mules seventyfive dollars was the maximum amount to be allowed for any such horse or mule This contract contained in the bill of lading was signed in Nor folk Virginia En route one of the horses died and three were injured so that the plaintiff sustained damages amounting to five hundred and seventyseven dollars and thirtythree cents for 5 1913  705 EDITORIAL18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER which he sued Upon the first trial of the case he recovered a verdict for the full amount claimed which was set aside On the second trial he recovered damages representing the value of the horses as limited in the bill of lading and damages to other horses and the freight expenses From this decision he appealed and the judgment and verdict were set aside by the Supreme Court The main defence in the case was that the contract being for an interstate shipment was regulated by the interstate com merce law and not by the laws of Virginia therefore the laws of Virginia did not apply to this interstate shipment The Su preme Court of South Carolina held that the Acts of Assembly of Virginia Extra Session 24 page 980 Code 1904  1294L governed the case this section providing that no agreement made by a transportation company for exemption from liability for injury or loss occasioned by its own neglect or misconduct as a common carrier shall be valid and the court quoted with approval C  O v Beasley 104 Va 788 which construed this section as follows The conclusion of the whole matter may in our view be summed up as follows At common law the carrier could not by contract limit or restrict his liability for injury or loss caused by negligence of himself or servants The object of the Legis lature was to give to this recognized commonlaw principle the force of a statute and it would indeed be a singular outcome of an effort on the part of the Legislature to give an added sanction to the common law if by the ingenious construction the power to limit should be deduced from the prohibition to exempt So the court decided that unless the Congress of the United States had sought to prohibit a carrier engaged in interstate transporta tion from limiting or has permitted a carrier to limit its liability to a stipulated valuation or has legislated on the precise question at issue the State of Virginia could require common carriers al though engaged in interstate commerce to answer for the whole loss resulting from their negligence whether there is a contract or not and thereupon the court proceeded to decide that Con gress had not legislated or attempted to legislate upon the sub ject dealt with by the Virginia statute and that the purpose of the Interstate Commerce Act is stated in the Armour Packing Company v United States 209 U S 56 and various other cases 706  Janand that as stated its great purpose was to prevent unjust and unreasonable rates prevent favoritism secure equality require publication of rates and tariffs and to give all the same oppor tunity to know what the rates were and to have the equal benefit of them The Interstate Commerce Act was intended to deal primarily with rates anddiscriminations and the right of a com mon carrier to limit this liability by special contract is not in cluded therein either expressly or by implication But the court held further that even if the act of Congress was intended to supersede all legislation on the question under consideration it could have no application the defendant having failed to allege or prove that it had complied with the require ments of the act of Congress The court therefore held that the Virginia statute having been construed by the Virginia court should govern in the case The case therefore is of double in terest to the profession not only in this State but in others not only upon the question of the lex loci contractus but also as pass ing upon a somewhat novel question as to the effect of the Inter state Commerce Law upon State laws limiting liability The REGISTER for the last few days has been calling the atten tion of our law makers and the profession generally to the in consistencies and unfairness of  2544 and Probate of Wills 2639a of the Virginia Code These sections have at last come under the consideration of our Supreme Court of Appeals in the cases of Saunders v Link decided Nov 11th 1912 and Ramsey v Dodd Nov 21st 1912 The latter case very briefly decides that a bill will not lie to an order of probate by the clerk of a court the remedy being by ap peal to the court whose clerk made the order admitting the will to probate The former enters very fully into a discussion of the two sections of the Code and calls attention to the remark able and we may add outrageous condition in which the law now stands It will be recalled that when a will is probated in the clerks office before the clerk without notice to any one the limitation for an appeal is one year There is no saving as to infants or nonresidents or other persons in interest not parties 1913  707 EDITORIAL18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER to the proceedings who without fault on their part may be de prived of their rights after a lapse of one year by orders in a proceeding of which they have no knowledge Yet when a will is probated in court under  2544 any party interested who was not a party to the proceedings has two years within which to file a bill in equity to impeach or establish the will with right to trial by jury There is also a saving as to infants and nonresidents The court says that this matter might with propriety be called to the attention of the Legislature for the purpose of having a revision of the enactment but very properly adds that where the language of a statute is plain and within the competency of the Legislature it is the province of the courts not to rewrite it but to give it effect as they find it That these two sections of a law as to the probate of wills should be amended there can be no question The Editorin Chief was rash enough some four years ago to draw a bill which brought these two sections in accordmaking the limitation in both cases one yearallowing a bill to be filed or an appeal taken from the probate of the will in the clerks office at the option of the party contesting the will and with a saving clause for infants parties under disability and nonresidents in both cases The bill was introduced in the House of Delegates went to the com mittee and has remained there ever since as far as this deponent knoweth It is to be sincerely hoped that in light of the courts decision in these two cases and its clear indication of the need of amend ment the next Legislature will cure the glaring defects in this law A perusal of the opinion of Mr Justice McKenna delivered December 2nd 1912 in the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Eubank v City of Rich Police PowerAuthor mond by which the opinion of the izing the Establishing Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia of Building Liens is reversed in the case of Eubank v City of Richmond 110 Va 735 does not convince the careful reader that our Supreme Court of Ap peals was wrong In our humble judgment the opinion of Judge 708  JanWhittle is far more convincing to the average mind and is better law than the law as now laid down of the Supreme Court of the United States Of course we thoroughly understand that the law now stands as the Supreme Court of the United States has de livered it but we can only say as a distinguished Circuit Judge once said when reversed by the Supreme Court of Appeals If I had been in their place and they in mine the result would have been different The city of Richmond in pursuance of an Act of Assembly authorizing the councils of cities and towns to es tablish building lines on streets to which all property owners must conform passed an ordinance that Whenever the owner of twothirds of the property abutting on any street shall in writing request the committee on streets to establish a building line on the side of the square on which their property fronts the said committee shall establish such line so that the same shall not be less than five nor more than thirty feet from the street line In pursuance of this ordinance a building line was established by the committee on streets and the plaintiff in error Eubank was fined by the Hustings Court of the city of Richmond for vio lating this ordinance He took an appeal to the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia which confirmed the judgment of the Hustings Court of the city of Richmond which held that the ordinance and the Act of Assembly were clearly within the po lice power and constitutional The main argument used before the Supreme Court of Virginia was that the statute was uncon stitutional and that the City Council had no power to delegate functions arising out of its police power to the Committee on Streets Our Supreme Court held that the statute was neither unreasonable nor unusual but passed in good faith and in the interests of the health safety comfort or convenience of the pub lic and for the benefit of the property owners generally where affected by its provisions and it quoted amongst other cases Bar bier v Connelly 113 U S 27 C B  Q Railway Company v Drainage Commissioners 200 U S 561 and Bacon v Walker 204 U S 311 It disposed of the second defence by saying that the committee was clothed with no discretion as to whether a street line shall or shall not be established in a given case but the only discretion left to the committee in the discharge of an ad 1913  709 EDITORIAL18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ministrative function was to determine within prescribed limits how far the building line shall be from the line of the street The Supreme Court of the United States however reversed the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia upon this very ground holding that the ordinance leaves no discretion in the Committee on Streets as to whether the street line shall or shall not be estab lished in a given case the action of the committee being deter mined by twothirds of the property owners This the Supreme Court of the United States says is the vice in the ordinance and makes it an unreasonable exercise of the Police Power and they argue that if one person had twothirds ownership of a block he would therefore have power against a number having a less quan titative ownership The United States Supreme Court seems to leave out of the question that twothirds ownership of a block in one person would certainly entitle that person to have a definite building line established as against the wishes of onethird of the block It is not a question here of the majority of votes but a question of the majority of ownership and for the benefit of the whole block in order that the streets of a city should present a uniform appearance and that the health safety comfort and con venience and the benefit of the property owners generally might be subserved We are constrained to the opinion therefore that the argument used by Mr Justice McKenna as controlling the Supreme Court of the United States is not a sound one but that the opinion of our own Supreme Court presents the right reason for its de cision Count Smorltork in Pickwick Papers spoke of Ze word Poltic as surprising in himself etc We are tempted to use the excla mation every time we read a decision of the The Police Power Supreme Court of the United States on the Some More police power substituting these two words for Poltic We havejust alluded to the decision reversing ourown Supreme Court in Eubank v City of Richmond where in our judgment the police power was amply sufficient to justify the city ordinance 710  JanIn the case of Purity Extract etc v Lynch decided Dec 2nd 1911 Mr Justice Hughes delivering the opinion of the court holds that it is within the police power of the state of Mississippi to prohibit the sale of any malt liquor even though it was not in toxicating and did not contain alcohol He bases the judgment of the court upon the right of a State to prohibit the trade in in toxicants and to sustain this view the Justice states that a general prohibition of the sale of malt liquors whether intoxicating or not is a necessary means to suppression of trade in intoxicants and that such a state of law sufficiently appears from the legisla tion of other states and the decision of the courts in its construc tion He quotes Maine New Hampshire Ohio Nebraska and Wisconsin cases And the learned Judge might have quoted Henrys Case 110 Va 879 All of which is delicious reading to a lover of states rights until we turn to the decision of the Court on the same day in the case of Buck Store etc Co v C C Vickers where following the decision in International TextBook Co v Pigg 217 U S 91 the Court holds that not even the police power of a state permits it to compel a foreign corporation attempting to do business in the borders to comply with such reasonable terms as the Legislature has provided in requiring it to make ap plication to the Charter Board of the State pay a registration fee and various other qualifications looking to a proper regulation of corporations We commented upon International TextBook Co v Pigg in Volume XVI p 143 of the REGISTER and we adhere to our opinion then and there expressed When the police pow ers an insurmountable obstacle in many cases comes in con tact with the irresistable power of Interstate Commerce chaos in legal consistency is the general result We wonder if the police power would permit a State to prohibit the sale of liquid coffee on the ground that it looks like Brown Stout or cold tea on the ground that it is not unlike whiskey We commend a careful research into this question to the general counsel of the Postum Cereal makers 1913  711 EDITORIAL18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The Bar Association of the city of Richmond at a meeting held December 4 1912 adopted the following resolution Resolved that a committee of five Reform inEquityPrac members of the Richmond Bar be tice in Virginia appointed to study the new Rules of Practice in Federal Courts of Equity promulgated by the Supreme Court of the United States No vember 4 1912 and report to this Association at a subsecuent meeting whether the prompt and economical administration of justice in Virginia would be promoted by the adoption of the same or similar rules of practice in our State courts And the said committee shall report in full such of said rules as in their opinion should be adopted for practice in our State courts embodying in said rules such changes or amendments as may be necessary to adapt the same to Virginia procedure And said committee shall designate in their report which oi said last mentioned rules if any could be put in operation by order of the trial courts and which of said rules may be put in operation by the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia under  3112 of the Code and which of said rules would require leg islative action to enforce And this Association hereby requests Hon Daniel Grinnan formerly Judge of the Chancery Court of the city of Richmond to act as chairman of said committee and that the remaining four members be appointed by the president of this Association The chairman appointed the following committee Daniel Grinnan chairman Wyndham R Meredith J J Leake Pres ton Cocke Jno Garland Pollard It will thus be seen that the new Equity Rules are bearing fruit but it is to be much regretted that the Bar Association did not appoint a committee to consider the reform of our Common Law Practice The practice in the Courts of Equity in Virginia has been by statute and decisions reduced to a comparatively simple matter and if Rules No 18 and 22 were adopted Equity Pleading in Virginia would need little amendment The first rule alluded to abolishes technical forms of pleading except as otherwise prescribed by statute or the new rules and the second provides that when a suit commenced in equity should have been 712  Jan1913  EDITORIAL 713 brought as an action on the law side of the court it should forth with be transferred to the law side with only such alterations in the pleading as shall be essential It is to be regretted that the Richmond Bar Association has not taken up the question of re form in the commonlaw pleading where reform is much more needed than in equity We believe that if the committee of the Richmond Bar Associationwhich consists of some of the ablest lawyers in the Commonwealthwould formulate a system of rules for the reform of our commonlaw pleading and submit them to the judges of our Supreme Court of Appeals it would not be long before that body would as it has the right to do simplify and reform to the fullest extent our present antiquated and cumbersome system of pleading on the law side of the courts Mark Twain when shown a notice of his death in a news paper said the report was very much exaggerated Heine in that wonderful little book Reise von Is a Publication of a Miinchen nach Genua spoke of the Mans Death Libelous little Veronica as einer wunderscho the Man Being Alive nen Frau die damals gar Keinen Feh ler hatte ausser dass sie tot war It has been left for a New York lawyer to discover that Heine was right when he spoke of being dead as a fault Otherwise we cannot imagine any reputable lawyer advising and bringing a suit for libel based upon an erroneous publication of a mans death The casewhich is certainly one of first intention in this coun tryactually got as far as the Supreme Court of New York One Cohen sued the New York Times for publishing a notice of his death when he was in reality alive and as the suit indicated kicking The Times demurred but the lower court overruled the demurrer The Times appealed and the Supreme Court overruled the lower court saying The question whether this publication could be a libel per se involves the inquiry whether it could have injured the reputation An exquisitely beautiful woman who had only one faultthat of being dead714 18 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER  Jan of the plaintiff Here is a bare item of news in a newspaper The item states that an event has come to pass which is looked for in the history of every man is regarded as beyond his con trol and therefore does not permit the inference that the man has done any act or suffered any act which he could not have done or which he need not have suffered Prematurity is the sole pe culiarity How can the publication of such an event merely as a matter of news hold up the subject to scorn to hatred to contempt or to ridicule so that his reputation is impaired Such publication may be unpleasant it may annoy or irk the subject thereof it may subject him to joke or to jest or to banter from those who know him or know of him even to the extent of affecting his feelings but this in itself is not enough It seems to us there is no answer to this opinion of the court and we can only wonder that such a suit could ever have been brought But then New York is a wonderful place

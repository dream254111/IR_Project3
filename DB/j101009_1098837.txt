j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098837,George M Cochran as a Lawyer,i245875,GEORGE M COCHRANVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL VI SEPTEMBER 1900 No 5 GEORGE M COCHRAN AS A LAWYJi The bar of Virginia unites in mourning the loss to the profession in the death April 6 1900 of the great Valley lawyer George M Cochran George M Cochran was a native of Augusta county Virginia where he lived and labored to the end He belonged to that hardy and libertyloving race who strikingly believe in plain living and high thinkingthe ScotchIrish He inherited the sturdy qualities of his race and was indeed a typical ScotchIrishman Nature was liberal to him both mentally and physically He was a striking example of mens sana in corpore sano He was of com manding stature standing some six feet tall full chested with broad shoulders and tapered to his feet He carried his head erect and the head he bore was a model for the artist In him power and force were written in every lineament and expressed in every movement No one could behold him without recognizing the man of genius His voice was powerful and sympathetic ranging through all the keys in the scale His eye was bold defiant and magnetic and his heart throbbed with emotion but was subject to his will He had a quick and retentive memory a heartsearching intuition and a perception like the flashing of the light He was possessed of a strong masculine understanding brilliant imagination profound judgment and a mas terful will In him all the modifications of moral life could find a tonean accent He had all his life been a wide reader and a deep thinker His mind was stored with the winnowed wisdom of the ages and he brought all his gifts and acquirements to bear on the practice of his profession of which he was a master Mr Cochran after completing a thorough academic education at the University of Virginia studied law at the same school under that distinguished law instructor John B Minor graduating in 1856 In the same year he began the practice of his profession in Staunton Au gusta county Virginia and except during his four years of service in276 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept the war between the States he continued in active practice until the day of his death He died in harness Death came to him without a warning when he was in apparently good health and in the prime of his intellectual faculties Although the vigor of his intellect had not one whit abated yet for the last few years and since his promising young son John Baldwin came to the bar he did little office work and no jury practice but devoted his time to work in appellate courts and to advising members of his profession His advice was constantly sought after by members of the bar throughout this State and West Virginia He had made a very comfortable fortune in the practice of his profession and always gave his advice to his brethren free of charge There was hardly an important case at his home bar that he was not called on for friendly advice by counsel Until five or six years ago Mr Cochran appeared in almost every important jury case whether civil or criminal that was tried in the courts of Staunton and Augusta county As a trial lawyer after the death of John B Baldwin he reigned supreme in the Valley of Vir ginia and during the life of Baldwin it was as the ScotchIrish of the Valley expressed it nip and tuck between Cochran and Baldwin It is not common for young lawyers to take a high place in their profession at the start The law is a trying profession and if within ten years a lawyer has taken a fair stand at a strong bar he has done well Not so however with Mr Cochran He went right to the front in a bound and at a time when giants were at the bar such as Harman Fultz Sheffy Michie Stuart and Baldwin In his office work Mr Cochran was a painstaking methodical busi ness man His clients business never suffered in his hands As soon as collections were made they were paid over and at the close of his lucrative practice there are no disagreeable odds and ends about his estate to embarrass his executor During his long professional life he made it an invariable rule to attend to business promptly and to use dispatch with everything in hand He was a rapid worker and could do more work in a given time than any lawyer we ever knew He had the genius of doing work in the simplest way He had a marvelous gift of condensing thought and in expressing himself in the fewest and simplest words He would say in a few lines what it would take pages for others to say His pleadings were models of brevity his arguments were condensed thunderbolts He never advised a client to bring a suit that he did not think was1900 GEORGE M COCHRAN 277 founded on right and justice and in the memory of the bar he was never known to lose a suit that had been brought by his advice When he was retained in a case he gave it the most painstaking attention He first required his client to state his case in his own way and then proceeded to subject him to a close and severe examination in order to better arrive at a clear understanding of the whole matter Nor did he take for granted all that his client said about his case He was never credulous We once heard him say that a lawyer could not be too careful in searching his client to find out the truth of his case and ought always to examine with special care the case of the client who comes ready to promise everything offering to produce a cloud of witnesses and documents and averring that his adversary would not even offer any evidence on certain material points Not relying alone on his client he always promptly resorted to every other accessible source of information about the case in hand He was a careful searcher after the facts on both sides of a case and when he came to trial he knew his adversarys strong and weak points almost as well as his own He did not gain his information by proxy alone but interviewed his witnesses in person He always said that the lawyer is a simpleton who calls witnesses to testify without first personally in terviewing them If possible he interviewed the most influential and intelligent witness in the presence of the other witnesses Where a witness appeared to be weak tricky or vacillating he took a note of his evidence and required the witness to sign it or else he examined the witness in the presence of some certain and reliable person All that could be learned about the case before trial he knew and always had his course mapped out for the introduction of testimony On the day set for trial if he found that anything had been left undone that ought to have been done he would gain a continuance if it could be done honorably But few lawyers if any however were more prompt than he in having their cases ready for trial The applicable law was carefully attended to in the case in hand We never knew him to be taken by surprise on a question of law at the trial He instinctively avoided bad law and endeavored to plant his case on sound legal principles He never tried to make every possible point but the strong points he was always ready and prepared to bring out in bold relief When he went into a trial he had at his command the law controlling the facts and he had that wonderful faculty of discerning at once the whole truth of his case Before going into the trial he took care to find out all that he could6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER about the jurytheir religion and politics their social standing and environments their prejudices etc and he specially endeavored to ascertain whether any of them were prejudiced against him or his client or against the character of the case to be tried When he came to present his case to the jury he knew each man of them almost as if they had been his old friends It must not be supposed however that he himself ever mixed among the jurors and was with them  a hail fellow He was never familiar with any one He never gave a juryman to understand by his action or manner that he had any favors to ask or that he expected any He had nothing of the demagogue about him and was never  one of the boys He was as reserved amongst the masses as a British peer He was too much of a ScotchIrishman to unbend socially for any advantage it might bring yet he knew all classes of men as well as if he had all his life been amongst the boys and he had a hold upon the confidence of the masses in the Valley of Virginia that no other man ever had In his opening statement he always presented his case in the simplest way that the law and the facts would admit He gave the substance of what he intended to prove concisely and in an abridgment It often happened that he opened in ten minutes a case that would have occupied other lawyers half an hour or more But when his evidence was disjointed he always presented it in his opening state ment piece by piece to the jury with such perfect system and order that they could readily see the relation of each piece to the other and the bearing of each item upon the whole case His statements were never overdrawn were truthful and natural and always followed in order time and place so that the simplest mind on the jury could get a right understanding of the case He had the happy faculty of never stating too much nor too little We never knew him to give his ad versary any advantage from his opening statement He was always intensely in earnest in his opening and used such wonderful force combined with moderation that we have often known him in effect to state his adversary out of court He called his witnesses to prove his case according to the careful systematic order that he had arranged beforehand so that the jury could gain a clear and connected understanding of the case from the witnesses To avoid breaks or confusion in the evidence he always if possible avoided calling a witness out of the logical order He used to say that he had frequently seen good cases lost by calling material 278 SeptGEORGE M COCHRAN witnesses out of their order for the reason that the lay mind is easily confused and material points are often lost sight of by the jury when the evidence is introduced in a disconnected way The rules of evidence seemed to be part and parcel of his being and fairly oozed out of the pores of his skin He was a prodigy in divining the character and peculiarities of witnesses and of the jury and an adept in the application of his knowledge in the examination of witnesses He never led his own witness in material matters to do so he asserted was a disadvantage He said that he had often known ma terial evidence to be emasculated by leading questions and that the jury always distrusts that which comes from the mouth of counsel rather than from the witness We have known members of the bar to be surprised at the way he would often allow his adversary to ask leading questions in chief But when he came to the argument of the case it was always apparent why he had permitted it for he invari ably gave the jury to understand that the testimony thus adduced was from the mouth of counsel rather than from the mouth of the witness He never failed to convert into absolute distrust the suspicions of the jury about evidence elicited by leading questions He never asked his own witnesses such questions as  Are you sure of that  or  Are you quite sure or  Have you any doubt of it  He used to say that that species of crossexamination of your own witness is a common fault in weak or inexperienced lawyers and that there is hardly a surer way of impressing the jury that you do not quite believe your own witness and besides running the risk of causing your witness to say that he is not quite sure or that he has some doubt and thus producing disastrous results If in the testimony of his own witness there were any specially weak points that he believed his adversary would bring out with force he would anticipate it and himself bring it out but so adroitly that he would absolutely thwart the advantage that his adversary might have otherwise gained He always tried to get a witness to give his testimony in his own natural way and to tell his story just as he would tell it to his friends out of court He watched his witness carefully while giving evidence and only interrupted him to avoid irrelevant or hearsay matter He encouraged a witness in telling his story by the commonplace ques tions such as  What took place next etc His aim was always to bring out the events in the order in which they occurred with all 1900 279280 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept associated conversations and minor incidents and details and he en deavored by proper and apt questions to draw out of the witness every material thing that they knew about the principal events and the details and incidents connected with each event so that the wit ness as he proceeded and at the conclusion of his examination had completed and perfected his statement in every detail and had brought out and emphasized every strong point in his testimony In this way nothing that ought to have been told was omitted The principal events and points in the testimony of each witness were specially brought out and impressed on the jury and as he used to express it he always tried to clinch every point in the testimony as he proceeded with the examination of a witness Besides his great skill in exami nation his inspiring presence magnetic voice and manner inimitable seemed to redouble the confidence of his witnesses and to quicken their wits He used to say that the inexperienced believe that cases are very often won by crossexamination or by a great speech but that he had long ago found out that cases are only rarely won by either speaking or crossexamination Once when asked his advice about crossexamination he said that he had found out by much experience that the most important duty of an advocate is the examination of witnesses but that usually more harm than good is done in crossexamination and that he had often heard greatlyadmired crossexaminations that were ruinous to the case in issue Like Scarlett the great English lawyer he generally asked but few questions on crossexamination and always more with the view to enforce the facts that he meant to rely on than to affect the credibility of the witness If his adversarys witness had not damaged him to any extent he would tell the witness to stand aside and he never crossexamined when a witness had given a plainspoken and frank statement and there was risk of giving aid to the other side by any question that might be asked He always came to the trial with full knowledge as far as possible of all the favorable and unfavorable proof that could be made by the adverse witnesses and when he crossexamined always brought out with force and effect that version of the opposing witness which was consistent with his own theory of the case On crossexamination he never failed to show where a witness had been mistaken or to bring out every point that took away or tended to destroy the force of his1900 GEORGE M COCHRAN 281 testimony and if the witness was unworthy of credit he never failed to show it conclusively to the jury As soon as he had gained an ad vantage on crossexamination upon any one point he would as a rule leave that point at once for fear the witness if pressed further might see the advantage and explain it away He never reexamined his witnesses as a rule unless it was abso lutely necessary If his adversary brought out anything favorable to him he left it alone but where on crossexamination conversations or documents had been made admissible in his clients favor he never failed to avail himself of the opportunity to introduce such evidence and to bring it out with great effect No one was ever quicker to see the mistakes of his adversary and to turn them to his own use and no one was ever quicker in seeing meeting or counteracting an advan tage gained by his adversary When the credibility of his own wit ness had been assailed on crossexamination he was always adroit in eliciting explanations of doubtful circumstances and grounds of sus picion and he never failed to give the real character to a transaction capable of two constructions In the argument he grasped the strong point of the case and mar shalled his facts and arguments on that point of assault As in attack so in defense he chose some strong position and concentrated upon it all his powers of logic and argument He never wasted his time nor divided his strength among many heads and divisions of a subject He laid down a great leading principle and all of his efforts were consumed in elucidating it He never discussed anything that did not practically help to the verdict He did not care what became of the minor points if he could make some strong position impregnable This method had not only the effect to strengthen his arguments but to better enable the jury to remember them His style was simple but full of energy and force He never strained after effect but sent his appeals straight home to the reason He was noted for the purity of his SaxonEng lish and his power of sustained effort He had the striking ability of always keeping the end in view from the beginning and a remarka ble gift to make every subordinate point fit into the whole He was intensely in earnest and from start to finish never failed to rivet the attention of the jury He shot his arguments redhot into the jury and with the power of his voice presence and action wrought them into their very beings He had led a pure and stainless life and was respected of all men This combined with6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER his splendid abilities made him almost irresistible before a home jury We have known him to win many cases by his great arguments and almost without any evidence Some years ago he was counsel for a man who was indicted for a heinous crime There was but one witness in the case and that witness was for the commonwealth It seemed to every one who heard the evidence that it was a foregone conclusion that the accused would be convicted But Mr Cochran presented the evidence of this witness in such a way with such varied genius and with such wonderful power that he obtained from the jury an acquittal and we afterwards heard the prosecuting witness say that Mr Cochran by his argument had convinced him that he himself was mistaken in some of his statements Mr Cochran was not usually severe or sarcastic with his adversary but on one occasion he completely demolished a very conceited attor ney who in the conclusion of his argument for the plaintiff turned to Mr Cochran who represented the defendant and in a rather offensive manner said It is the polished steel of my evidence that pierces your madeup armor and that brings death and destruction to you and your case Mr Cochran in reply opened his argument in a man ner that was terrific and said Sir if you ever had any polished steel in your evidence it has sir in your hands been turned to blunted brass and falls harmless to the ground On one occasion when Mr Cochran was indisposed in addressing a jury he had frequently been interrupted by opposing counsel Finally when the discussion came to a certain point counsel again interrupted and asked in an impertinent manner Do I understand you to pre tend that there is no difference between us  Mr Cochran promptly replied in the language of Lord Bacon There sir is a great differ ence between you and mefor me it is a pain to speak for you sir a pain to hold your tongue In one of the last important criminal cases in which Mr Cochran appeared the commonwealths attorney had made a long speech into which there had been injected much abuse and wit Mr Cochran in reply destroyed the whole force and effect of the speech by stating in his most emphatic manner that the speech of the commonwealths attorney was nothing but a continent of mud and rot He rarely played upon words in an argument but on one occasion when appearing for a person who had gotten into a drunken brawl at a disreputable bar room Mr Cochran said If the devil should lose Sept 2821900 GEORGE M COCHRAN 283 his tail he could readily get another where bad spirits are retailed He rarely told anecdotes to illustrate but when he did it was with great effect In addressing the court his manner was altogether different He was just as dead in earnest but without the passion and fire that he always displayed before a jury His arguments before the court were in a conversational style We have often heard him say that nothing was more ridiculous than to hear a lawyer shouting his arguments to a court His aim was to speak properly to every point needing notice and to make his points clear in a quiet earnest way He used to say that a lawyer ought to address his arguments only to the head of the court and not to both head and heart as when addressing a jury From the beginning to the conclusion he was ever guided by an instinctive fulfillment of the requirements of his case Few if any lawyers ever won more cases in the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia than he In arguing before that court he always first made a clear and concise statement of his case so that the court could have an understanding of the whole matter involved and better see the application of his arguments He observed order and arrange ment and made his points clearly and distinctly carefully endeavoring to sustain each position taken with authorities in point He never took up the time of the court in offering authorities that required argument to show their application to the case in issue He cited all necessary authorities if he could get them and no more He regarded it bad practice to cite a multiplicity of authorities His arguments were always powerful and convincing bearing down all opposition and blazing the way to his purpose in view The most perplexing masses of law and facts became resolved and luminous under the sunlight of his intellect Mr Cochran was an active and prominent member of the Virginia State Bar Association and at the meeting of that body held in 1893 at the White Sulphur Springs West Virginia he took a leading part in the debate on law reform and in the debate was pitted against that very able and distinguished Virginian the Hon John Randolph Tucker The debate was the most striking and interesting that ever entertained that association and in that debate Mr Cochran carried all the points that he advocated and made a great and lasting impres sion on the bar of Virginia Major Thomas C Elder said of him in the memorial adopted by the Staunton bar Mr Cochran was a great lawyer No284 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept educated or intelligent man especially if he was himself a lawyer could become well acquainted with Captain Cochran without recogniz ing him as a master in the profession Sometimes we see a man in the profession who is learned in it and not successful or apt in its practice and again we see a man whose success in the practice appears to be far beyond what his learning would seem to justify But our deceased friend was at once learned in the law as a science and eminently suc cessful in its practice   There was in the mental construction and makeup of our dis tinguished friend as is usually if not invariably the case a close connection between the directness of his perception amounting to al most intuition and the soundness of his judgment They acted and reacted on each other The points to be resolved being quickly and clearly ascertained and the judgment being then brought to bear directly on them to the exclusion of all irrelevant issues the conclu sion arrived at was apt to be correct The union of such perception and such judgment accounts in large measure for the power of con densation in speaking and writing which was a great and distinguish ing characteristic and accomplishment of our distinguished friend He was selfconfident without conceit He combined extreme bold ness with caution His knowledge of the law was profound and he knew mankind even better than he did the Code and the Reports He understood the infinite play of feelings which more than their reasons moved the people with whom he dealtparties witnesses jurors and even judges He was able to tell almost without premeditation when the courts would administer the letter and when the spirit of a par ticular statute He recognized truth intuitively wherever it existed and was just as apt in detecting falsehood He was an adept in making both jurors and courts see with his own eyes Many able lawyers wield civil inquiries and cases with peculiar ability and others criminal but how clearly and profoundly he elucidated questions of property is well known and with what address feeling pathos and prudence he defended with what dignity and crushing power accusatorio spiritu he prosecuted the accused whom he believed to be guilty few have seen or heard but none who have seen or heard can ever forget He was indeed a great lawyer and a great and a good man The grand tendency of his life and character was to elevate the bar and the whole tone of the public mind He was the pride and the glory of the Staunton bar CHARLES CURRY Staunton Va

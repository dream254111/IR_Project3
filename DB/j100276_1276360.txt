j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276360,Torts Strikes,i254511,RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS end is not yet Is it not time that we called a halt to this constantly grow ing list of manufactured articles that are considered so inherently danger ous in their nature as to put an absolute duty of inspection upon the manu facturer and an absolute liability even to those with whom he has no privity of contract if he fails to make such inspection This criticism is not directed at the conclusion reached by the court but at the basis on which it rests its decision The defendant contended that it was incumbent upon the plaintiff to show that the defendant had been negligent in the manufacture of the loaf and that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur did not apply to such a case But this contention was brushed aside and the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur allowed to control In that it would seem the court was wrong Why not put the case upon the ground that the defendant owed a certain duty of care to the plaintiff and that for the plaintiff to recover he must first show that the defendant has been negligent in the performance of that duty This phase of the question is barely mentioned while the cluty to inspect is stressed to the point that would hold the defendant liable at all events if he failed to make such inspection In this regard and in putting a loaf of bread in the same category with deadly poisons explosives and other dangerous instrumentalities the court placed its decision upon a ground extremely hard to support Opposed to MacPherson v Buick Motor Co supra on which case the decision in the principal case was based is Cadillac Motor Co v Johnson 221 Fed 8oi 137 C C A 279 L R A I9I5E 287 decided by the Federal Court in New York about a year before the decision in

In a case like this where the injury is intentionally inflicted the crucial question is whether there is justifiable cause for the act Martel v White 185 Mass 255 69 N E 1085 102 Am St Rep 341 64 L R A 260 Jackson v Stanfield 137 Ind 592 36 N E 345 24 L R A 469 The weight of authority is to the effect that the right of a labor union to use coercion and compulsion by strikes or threats thereof is limited to strikes or threats thereof against persons with whom the combination has a trade dispute Pickett v Walsh 192 Mass 572 78 N E 753 II6 Am St Rep 272 6 L R A N S I667 Likewise it is illegal to

Pelt 136 N C 633 49 S E I77 68 L R A 760 VENDOR AND PURCHASERTIME Or THE ESSENcEPlaintiff agreed to sell certain land to the respondent The purchase was to be completed by a fixed date and time was to be in all respects strictly of the essence of the contract The purchaser was accidentally prevented from completing at the fixed date by the sickness of his attorney and the vendor claimed a right to rescind the contract In an action by the purchaser for specific performance Held the vendor was entitled to rescind Brickles v Snell ig96 2 A C 599 86 L J P C 22 Time is not of the essence of an agreement to convey land unless it is expressly so stipulated or follows by necessary implication from the nature of the transaction Cromwell v Clinton Realty Co 67 N J Eq 540 58 Atl 10o3 There are however a few decisions to the contrary Crippiin v Heer inance Clarke Ch N Y I33 But when the contract is merely an option to purchase the courts are agreed that time should be of the essence Mc Kenzie v Murphy 31 Colo 274 72 Pac I075 The reason for this is ap parent Any extension of time in such a case might work the prospective vendor irreparable injury But a contract of that nature is not involved in the principal case The right to reject title if it is proved legally de fective and the obligation to accept if it is valid leaves the vendee no option The most reasonable construction of a contract such as the one in xolved here would seem to be that the equitable title vested when the con tract was entered into subject to be divested if the vendor should be un able to make good title But if this view is not taken it must be plain that the vendorpurchaser relation must have been established at the ex piration of the ten days at which time as provided by the contract the title would be deemed accepted if no written objection were made thereto The vendorpurchaser relation having been established then under either possible view the question arises whether the estate of the latter should be divested for failure to perform what must properly be considered a condition subsequent The vendor could have had specific performance of the contract and the injury which resulted to him from the trivial default of the purchaser was so slight that enforcement of the stipulation making 674

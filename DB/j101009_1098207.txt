the loss of that time wrongfully occasioned is damage to her We invite special attention to the case of Harmon v Old Colony R R Co very recently decided by the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ante at p 9 See what is there said as to the right of a married woman under the Massachusetts statutes to her time and observe the great similarity indeed sameness in some re spects of the statutes of Massachusetts and Virginia on the subject The Virginia statute in this particular was taken substantially from the Massachusetts statutes as will readily be seen by comparison There is an absence of desirable harmony in the judicial decisions on the particular question as may be seen by an exami nation of Mr Elliotts excellent note appended to the Massachusetts case but his conclusion is that the better reason and the weight of authority are with that case ANDERSON V HYGEIA HOTEL COMPANY Virginia Court of Appeals At Richmond March 12 1896 1 LIMITATIONSActions for personal injuries An action to recover damages for personal injuries caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation must be brought within one year from the time such injury was inflicted 2 APPELLATE COURTWrits of error how disposed of Writs of error in the Court of Appeals must be disposed of in accordance with the law as it ex isted at the time of the rendition of the judgment complained of If as the law then stood there is no error in the judgment it must be affirmed but if erroneous it must be reversed and such judgment entered as the lower court ought to have entered Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Elizabeth City county rendered September 13 1893 in an action of trespass on the case wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defendant in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case Burroughs  Brother and Borland  Wilcox for the plaintiff in error A S Segar Thomas Tabb and Ro M Hughes for the defendant in error RIELY J delivered the opinion of the court The plaintiff was injured by falling into an open pit filled with hot oil which was on the premises of the defendant company and brought  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter 21 1896VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER suit to recover damages for the injuries he had sustained The acci dent happened on January 12 1892 the suit was not instituted until June 1893 The defendant pleaded the statute of limitations the plaintiff de murred to the plea and the court overruled the demurrer and gave judgment for the defendant The correctness of the ruling of the court depends upon the construction of sec 2927 of the Code which is as follows  Every personal action for which no limitation is otherwise prescribed shall be brought within five years next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued if it be for a matter of such nature that in case a party die it can be brought by or against his representative and if it be for a matter not of such nature shall be brought within one year next after the right to bring the same shall have accrued The determination of the question whether the limitation of five years or of one year applies in this case necessitates an inquiry as to what actions terminate with the life of the person It was a rule of the common law that if an injury was done either to the person or the property of another for which damages only could be recovered in satisfaction the action therefor died with the person to whom or by whom the wrong was done In actions merely personal says Blackstone  arising ex delicto for wrongs actually done or committed by the defendant as trespass battery and slander the rule is that actio personalis moritur cmn persona and it never shall be revived either by or against the executors or other representatives  Book 3 p 302 See also Brooms Legal Maxims 874 Lomax on Exors 2d ed 470 and 4 Minors Institutes Pt 1 703 Certain innovations have by degrees been made by statutes upon this rule which have considerably altered it The statute of 4 Ed III ch 7 gave to executors an action for goods and chattels of their testators carried away in their lifetime and this being a remedial law was liberally construed The Legislature of Virginia early repealed the English Statutes and enacted in their place a similar statute to be found in I Revised Code of 1819 ch 104 sec 64 And it is now provided that a personal representative may sue or be sued for the taking or carrying away any goods or the waste or destruction of or damage to any estate of or by his decedent Section 2655 of the Code But while the rule of the common law has been much restricted and limited by statutes both in England and in this country and the right 22 MayANDERSON V HYGEIA HOTEL COMPANY to sue for an injury done to the property or estate of the decedent in his lifetime has been conferred on the personal representative of the deceased the rule has not been altered in this State in respect of an injury done to the person An action for an injury to the person still as at common law dies with the person and no right of action for such injury survives to his personal representative Therefore for an injury to the person the action must under the provisions of sec 2927 of the Code be brought within one year from the time the right of action accrues which is the time when the injury was sustained It is sought to take this case out of the rule of the common law by virtue of the provisions of secs 2902 and 2903 of the Code whereby it is provided that whenever the death of a person shall be caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation or of any ship or vessel and the act neglect or default is such as would if death had not ensued have entitled the party injured to maintain an action or to proceed in rem against said ship or vessel or in personam against the owners thereof or those having control of her  the person who or corporation or ship which would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action for damages and that every such action shall be brought by and in the name of the personal representative of such deceased person and within twelve months after his or her death The jury in any such action may award such damages as to it may seem fair and just not exceedirg ten thousand dollars and may direct in what proportion they shall be distributed to the wife husband parent and child of the deceased It is further provided that the amount recovered shall after the pay ment of costs and attorneys fees be paid to the wife husband parent and child of the deceased in such proportion as the jury may have directed or if they have not directed according to the statute of descents and distributions and shall be free from all debts and lia bilities of the deceased except where there are no such kindred in which case they shall become assets of the estate It is further provided by sec 2906 of the Code that the right of action under sections 2902 and 2903 shall not determine nor the ac tion when brought abate by the death of the defendant or the disso lution of the corporation when a corporation is the defendant and where an action is brought by a party injured for damage caused by the wrongful act neglect or default of any person or corporation and the party injured dies pending the action and his death is caused by such wrongful act neglect or default the action shall not abate by 1896 23VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER reason of his death but his death being suggested it may be revived in the name of his personal representative and the declaration and other pleadings shall be amended so as to conform to an action under sections 2902 and 2903 and the case proceeded with as if the action had been brought under the said sections It was claimed and earnestly contended in argument that the effect of these statutes is to cause the right of action for an injury to the person which is produced by the wrongful act neglect or default of another and death is the result of such injury to survive and to alter in such case the rule of the common law that an action for an injury to the person dies with the person so that the limitation upon the right of action in the case at bar would be under the provisions of sec 2927 of the Code five years and not one year This is however a mistaken view No action at law being maintainable against a person who by his wrongful act neglect or default may have caused the death of an other person the British Parliament in 1846 passed what is commonly known as Lord Campbells Act which was entitled An act for compensating the families of persons killed by accidents The Virginia Act secs 29022906 of the Code is modeled upon Lord Campbells Act and in its essential features is substantially the same The language of the Act clearly indicates that the Legislature had in view the rule of the common law and that its purpose in passing the Act was to provide for the case of an injured person who had a good cause of action but died from injuries without having recovered his damages It is intended to withdraw from the wrongdoer the im munity from civil liability which the rule of the common law afforded him and to provide for the recovery of such damages notwithstand ing the death of the injured person In doing so however it plainly did not intend to continue or cause to survive his right of action for the injury but to substitute for it and confer upon his personal repre sentative a new and original right of action Blake v R Co 83 E C L

ANDERSON V HYGEIA HOTEL COMPANY 25 27 Hegerich v Keddie 99 N Y 258 and Tiffanys Death by Wrong ful Act sec 23 It is very clear that this new right of action though founded upon a wrong already actionable by existing law in favor of an injured per son for his damages was not intended to be and is not a derivative one A brief consideration of the general principles of the Act will demonstrate the correctness of this view Where the right of action which the deceased person had in his lifetime survives his personal representative sues as the legal owner of the personal estate which has passed to him in course of law and the recovery is for the benefit of and constitutes assets of the estate of the decedent with the consequent liability for the payment of his debts The right of action of the personal representative is the same that was possessed by the deceased in his lifetime It proceeds on the same principles is sustained by the same evidence and the measure of re covery is the same But very different is the right of action given by the Act in ques tion The Act requires the suit to be brought by and in the name of the personal representative but he by no means sues in his general right of personal representative He sues wholly by virtue of the statute and in respect of a different right His suit proceeds on different principles He sues not for the benefit of the estate but primarily and substantially as trustee for certain particular kindred of the de ceased who are designated in the statute If the effect of the statute is as was contended to cause the right of action of the injured person to survive the suit by his personal representative would be to recover damages for the injury the deceased had sustained and the detriment caused to his estate The same kind of evidence would be necessary and admissible to support the action that would be proper if the injured person himself were suing There would be the same elements of damage for the consideration of the jury in assessing the damages The evidence would mainly relate to and the damages be for the physical and mental suffering of the de ceased and the injury and loss generally sustained by him and his estate But in a suit by the personal representative under the statute the evidence would primarily relate to and the damages be not only for the pecuniary loss the wife husband parent or child as the case might be had sustained but it would be proper for the jury in comVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER puting the damages to take also into consideration the grief and men tal anguish of such relatives and their loss in being deprived of the care attention and society of the deceased and to include therefor in the verdict such sum as the jury might deem fair and just B  O R  Co v Noels Admr 32 Gratt 394 and Matthews v Warners Admr 29 Do 570 The limit of recovery too is different In the one case the amount of recovery is limited only by the amount of the loss that may be proved in the other the recovery cannot in any case exceed ten thousand dollars Then again If the action were only a survival of the right of action of the injured person the recovery would constitute assets of his estate and be subject to the payment of his debts whereas it is expressly declared by the statute that the amount recovered under the statutory right of action except where there are no such kindred as are designated by the statute shall be free from all debts and liabili ties And further It was not any more intended by sec 2906 than by secs 2902 and 2903 nor has it any more effect to cause the right of action of the injured person to survive within the meaning of sec 2927 It is the right of action given by secs 2902 and 2903 to thepersonal representative of the injured person that the first clause of sec 2906 causes to survive upon the death of the wrongdoer if he be a person or the dissolution of the corporation if the wrongdoer be a corpora tion and not the right of action which the injured person had in his lifetime The section contains no provision for the survival of his right of action in such event That determines either with his own death or the death of the wrongdoer The residue of sec 2906 was simply intended to prevent delay and save the trouble and expense of a new suit when all these had already been incurred by the injured person who had brought his suit and died before recovering his damages But for sec 2906 all the delay cost and expense which he had incurred in his lifetime in bringing and maturing his suit for trial would be useless and incurred in vain if he died before the trial but without precluding the right of his per sonal representative to bring a new suit within twelve months after his death for the same cause of action and recovering such damages there for as to the jury might seem fair and just not exceeding the limit fixed by the statute This provision of sec 2906 was wisely enacted 26 MayANDERSON V HYGEfA HOTEL COMPANY to prevent the estate of the decedent from being unjustly mulcted with costs and to facilitate a recovery for the injury Sufficient has been said to show that the Act does not affect the rule of the common law and does not cause to survive within the meaning of sec 2927 the right of action for an injury to the person by the wrongful act neglect or default of another Such right of action still as at common law dies with the person and the limitation of one year applies in such case Curry v Town of Mannington 23 West Va 14 Flint v Griffin 3 S E R 33 and Martin v R Co supra It is proper however before concluding this opinion to advert to the Act of January 29 1894 Acts of 189394 p 83 amending sec 2906 which was invoked by counsel in support of their conten tion of the survivability of the right of action of the plaintiff in error within the meaning of sec 2927 What effect if any that Act may have in other cases on the question we have been considering it is un necessary to decide and we do not now mean to express any opinion one way or the other It can have none in this case The judgment in this case was rendered September 13 1893 and the Act above referred to was passed January 29 1894 The judg ment was final prior to the enactment of the statute This is not ex cept in a few cases specified in the Constitution a court of original but appellate jurisdiction and the writ of error must be disposed of in ac cordance with the law as it existed at the time of the rendition of the judgment This court must affirm it if there is no error therein ac cording to the law as it stood when the judgment was rendered and if erroneous reverse it and enter such judgment as the Circuit Court ought to have entered Sec 3485 of the Code Currin et als v Spraul et als 10 Gratt 145 148 Kennaird etc v Jones 9 Gratt

Currin et als v Spraul et als supra If a party shows a defence valid at the time it is passed on by the court a subsequent change in the law cannot deprive him thereof There is no error in the judgment of the Circuit Court and the samne is affirmed Affirmed BY THE EDITORThe decision and opinion in this case call for no com ment They are so clearly right that they will command the universal approval of the profession We have been attracted rather to what was not decidednot decided because not requiredthe construction of the Statute of 1894 Acts of 1896 27VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 189394 p 83 referred to in the opinion Suppose the cause of action in this case had arisen after instead of before the passage of that Act would the limita tion of one year or five years have applied  The construction of this amendatory act abounds in difficulties It is hard to determine the precise object and scope of the amendment The plain intent of the original section 2906 was to prevent abatement of the action by the death of either plaintiff or defendant pending the action If the action was brought by the personal representative under sees 2902 and 2903 it was provided that the death of the defendant or the dissolution of the corporation if a corporation was the defendant should not determine or abate the action It was foreseen that if the party injured by the wrongful act neglect or default of another brought an action in his lifetime to recover damages for the injury and died it matters not from what cause while the action was pending the common law rule actio per sonalis moritur cum persona would apply and the action would determine ipso facto Hence it was further provided that when the action was brought by the party in jured and he dies pending the action and his death is caused by the injury complained of the action should not thereby be determined but might be revived in the name of his personal representative with such change in the pleadings as to make the action conform to an action brought under sees 2902 and 2903 In short as ex plained in the opinion of the court in the principal case the revivor was but a substitution of one action for anotherthe action authorized by sees 2902 and 2903 for the pending action by the party injured and thus avoid the necessity of a new suit It was essential however to this constructive substitution that the death of the plaintiff pending the action should be caused by the wrongful act neglect or default complained of Now the section 2906 as amended and re enacted omits the provision that the death shall have been caused by wrongful act neglect or default and also omits the provision as to change of pleadings What then was the object of the amendment It would seem that the purpose was to prevent abatement by the death of the plaintiff pending the action of every suit brought to recover damages for wrongful act neglect or default whether the death was caused by such wrongful act neglect or default or not The result of this construction would be that the action would survive and under sec 2927 the limitation would be five years and not one year as before This is certainly a very radical change To make our meaning clearer we illustrate A is assaulted and beaten by B and brings his action against B to recover damages for the injury Pending the action A dies but his death is not caused by the assault and battery for which the suit is brought Under the construction suggested As suit does not abate by his death but may be revived by his personal representative and hence under sec 2927 in such a case the limitation of the right of action would be five years as no limitation is otherwise prescribed And this rule would apply to all other pending actions for damage caused by the wrongful act neglect or de fault of another We suppose however we confess we do not know that the term  wrongful act c as used in section 2906 taken in connection with its use in the preceding sections means some physical personal injury and therefore would not include slander libel and the like Suppose Anderson the plaintiff in the principal case had brought his suit for a cause of action arising after the Act of 1894 claiming in his declaration damages exceeding 10000 say 20000 and had died pending his action and it was shown 28 Maythat his death was caused by the  wrongful act neglect or default of the defend ant could the recovery in that case have exceeded 10000 the limit prescribed in a suit by his personal representative under sec 2903 Or might not the re covery have extended to the amount claimed in the declaration  If the latter then we have the anomaly of greater damages being allowed when death does not ensue from the injury than when it does Again in case of revivor of the pending action when the death of the plaintiff is caused by the wrongful act c of the defendant and a recovery is had are the proceeds to be distributed as provided by sec 2904 or are they to be considered and treated as a part of the estate of the decedent as in ordinary cases  These questions and others likely to arise under the Act of 1894 will come to perplex the bar and torment the courts The Act to make the best of it is a most bungling piece of legislation NYE V LOVITT AND ANOTHER Virginia Court of Appeals At Richmond March 26 1896 1 DEEDsConstruction ofTechnical wordsHeirs of

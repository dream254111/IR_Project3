Child Labor Committee I wish to emphasize in the remarks I am about to offer the importance of this movement as being not only in the interest of the child but of civilization There is a Greek legend according to which an ancient city was built to the sound of music A great musician struck the lyre and as the strains he wooed from it rose into the air so rose the walls of the favored city The meaning of the legend is transparent Music was to the Greeks the incarnation of measure They be lieved that the whole life of nations as well as of individuals should be musicalthat is subject to due restraints They would have condemned as grotesque a civilization based on the exaggerated appreciation of a single end such as material prosperity and charac terized by the absence of selfcontainment in the pursuit of this and by lack of consideration for other higher social interests I could not help thinking of this ancient story on visiting as I have now done for the first time your beautiful and wonderful city situated as it is between its lovely hills a city extemporized as it were at the bidding of energy and genius a city destined it would seem to become the centre of an everincreasing population And I could not but wish that your Birmingham too may like that city of old be built to the sound of musicthat is with due regard to the nobler human purposes involved in the future civilization of your community as well as of the whole country The child labor movement is making headway in every part of the United States though with unequal acceleration There have been notable gains both in legislation and also though not equally so in enforcement The former without the latter need less to say is inadequate And yet what even mere legislation can accomplish may be seen in the fact that the greatest number of young persons who enter the field of industry arc of the minimum age permitted by the law From this it is evident that by raising the IThe Annals of the American Academy minimum age the influx of young persons into industry may to a certain extent be controlled Everywhere then there has been a distinct forward movement and yet the goal is still very distant and we need the earnest sup port and cooperation of all who appreciate the holy war in which we are engaged a war having for its object the stability of civi lization as well as the welfare of the child Permit me with particular emphasis to call attention to the following point All students of sociology are practically agreed that it was the prolonged infancy of the human child that made civilization possible The long period during which the child is nonproductive has been the condition sine qua non of the evolution of human beings and this for two reasonsfirst the prolonged state of dependence has elicited the tenderer traits the capacity for selfsacrifice in the parents Without the children pulling at our heartstrings we should still be savages today Without the quali ties of generosity and selfsacrifice no civilization is worth having In the next place the prolonged exemption of the child from productive industry has been the means of securing to it the op portunity of physical growth and of mental preparation for the later work of life The thinkers of the world those who have given the greatest attention to the problems of human development unite to impress upon us the truth that mankind has slowly grown out of the state of primitive barbarity has slowly climbed to the level upon which we stand today thanks to the leisure and respite granted to the young offspring of human beings And yet at this very moment we find that wherever mechanical industry is introduced the tempta tion proves almost irresistible for those who have in mind only immediate and quick material aggrandizement to rob the child of that leisure and respite so necessary for its own sake and for the sake of progress in general and to employ the cheap labor of little children in order to multiply profits In the first volume of the report on the Condition of Woman and Child Workers in the United States we find the following fig ures In five Southern states I43 establishments were selected and in these establishments and in nine or ten others in the State of Mississippi there were found wellnigh a thousand children eleven years and under at work Think of itchildren of eleven years 2Child Labor a Menace to Civilization old and under at work To one not acquainted with the facts such a statement seems hardly credible yet the statistical data have not been impugned We find that of children seven years old there were in these establishments seventeen of children eight years old twentyeight of children nine years old 107 of children ten years old 283 of children eleven years old 494 Many of us have children of the same ageseleven and ten and nine and eight and seven I ask you in imagination to put your own children into the places of these little wageworkers Can you imagine yourselves for an instant satisfied that any child of yours of such tender years should be compelled to toil at monotonous wearying uninspiring uneducating labor as are these children  Is there not something contrary to the nature and spirit of the American people in these conditions Is it I ask congenial to our character to our institutions to permit that the weak shall bear the burdens of the strong Is it in harmony with American principles that 949 children eleven years and under shall do work that ought to be done by adults But if we ask for the reasons that have made this state of things possible I think we shall find that the principal reason is ignorance and lack of enlightenment on the part of parents em ployers and the general public alike rather than any desire to inflict harm And if we consider the operating motives I think they may perhaps be classified briefly as follows Child Labor Maintained by Fallacy In the first place the fallacy of reasoning from exceptional to average cases An employer who began to work as a child who never had any special educational advantages who forced his way upward by sheer pluck intelligence shrewdness and willpower such a man is disposed to ask Why cannot others achieve what I have accomplished He forgets that he is the exception that is very far from proving the rule He has had exceptional gifts exceptional tenacity exceptional opportunities A second reasonespecially in the Southern Statesis the marked individualism that resents the interference of the state and would limit such interference within the narrowest bounds This narrow attitude is giving way and is bound to give way more and 3The Annals of the American Academy more under the imperative pressure of social necessities and a more enlightened individualism will take its placean individual ism which realizes that collective action within its proper field is not only not prejudicial to the highest development and enrichment of individual life but is rather its indispensable prerequisite A third motive is false sympathy The wages of the little chil dren it is said are necessary to complete the income required by the family And from this point of view it seems unfeeling to de prive the parents of that increment to their revenue which can be furnished by the little hands This argument however is based upon a failure to see that if the earnings of the children were with drawn in the long run the adultwage would rise It is true that in the period of transition before this appreciation could take place there would be suffering But is it not the duty of society in general to come to the rescue at this point and to minimize the evils that are always involved in any passage from a lower to a higher stage  The appeal to sympathy I contend is fallacious Admit that the present condition is evil admit that a better condition can be reached then it is a profound error to limit the appeal of sentiment to the sufferings to be endured in the interval instead of directing it to the continuous and multifold evils that will ensue if the present condition remain unaltered And there is one point more to be noted One of the reasons why the movement for the abolition of child labor is retarded why it meets with such persistent opposition is sectional patriotism I think we shall find in any new community combined with the individual desire to get wealth quickly an ambition that the com munity of which one is a member may compare favorably with others in respect to rapid material progress This is especially likely to be the case in a section like this wonderful Southern country the immense resources of which have been lying dormant so long and which is now opening up prospects of vast extension of power and wealth to those whose imagination is capable of conceiving of them We may allow for the unselfishness or to speak more truth fully the collective selfishness implied in this motive But none the less we must insist upon the peril and the folly of striving for economic power at the expense of those permanent social assets and interests of which I spoke at the beginning 4Child Labor a Menace to Civilization 5 Robbing Society of Childhood Let me give you a concrete example of what I have here in mind In the same government report to which allusion has been made several cases are mentioned that have occurred in North Carolina mills They are not typical in any sense but they do indicate the dangers incurred the havoc wrought whenever the materialistic incentive is allowed to operate unchecked In one of the mills the children of a single familyone thirteen years old one eleven years old and one ten years oldhave worked for a considerable part of the eight months preceding the investi gation on an average seventeen hours a day Consulting the pay rolls the investigator found that they were paid off at the rate of seventyeight to eightyfour hours a week These children would work from six a mremember children thirteen eleven and ten years of ageuntil six p m with thirtyfive minutes inter mission for dinner and then after supper would frequently return to work for half the night until midnight or would remain at home until midnight and then turn in to work the second shift of the nightchildren I repeat ten eleven and thirteen years of age Imprint these facts upon your memory Such concrete cases are more cogent than a world of abstract argument Such conditions are still possible in the United States And why are these children so mercilessly overtaxed In some cases it is true that the father being a neerdowell simply lives on the earnings of his children But in the case mentioned it was not so the father of the family was himself a hardworking man He did not spare himself he worked hard day by day He was merciless to himself and he was merciless to his offspring Often indeed we find that those who are willing themselves to endure the greatest hardships are the most ruthless and pitiless toward others This man did not spare him self and he did not spare his own flesh He worked and his chil dren worked And of course we are not surprised to hear that not one of them had any education that neither the parents nor the children could read or write Then there is another family mentioned where there were five wageearners several of them children Together they had accum ulated in one year the sum of 400 but neither the adults nor the children of that family could read or write And the youngest it is said was an exceptionally bright childa child of ten yearsThe Annals of the American Academy Surely it is pitiful to think of an exceptionally bright child who has not the opportunity to acquire even the rudiments of an education In this government report we learn also that not fifty per cent of the children who are at work at fourteen have ever had as much as twelve months schooling And so I repeat that not merely considerations of sentiment but concern for American civilization should enlist us in this move ment for the protection of the children For how shall we ever work democracy with men who when they were fourteen years of age had not even had twelve months schooling Or with un usually bright children who had not seen the interior of a school room Or with children who are in the millsI will not say seventeen hours a day but during the normal factory day Chil dren as young as these of whom there are so many in the South and so many more in other sections of our land Menace to Efficiency And there is yet one other reason which I wish to mention A general discussion is at present going on on the subject of efficiency and whatever doubts may be expressed as to certain means of producing efficiency it is unquestionable that efficiency itself of the right kind is the condition not only of progress but of maintaining the standards at which we have already arrived Efficiency means physical vigor unimpaired for without a sound body there cannot be a forwardreaching vigorous intelligence Efficiency means mental training of such a kind that the worker shall understand the principles underlying the processes The effi cient workerthe skilled worker as we call himis he who instead of merely repeating a process understands the reasons for it and therefore is intelligent about it and because he is in daily touch with the details of the work can suggest improvements of it Efficiency then depends on physical strength and mental and moral develop ment and the movement for the abolition of child labor regarded from this point of view is nothing else than a movement having for its purpose to provide for those young children who are to be the workers in America the possibility of becoming efficient Without this supreme quality they will not be able to compete with the workers of other countries Without it they will not be able to maintain and to further elevate the standard of living among the 6Child Labor a Menace to Civilization 7 working class Efficiency in all lines of activity is today more than ever the supreme desideratum But how can the thousands of young children who are employed today become efficient if we waste their possibilities by premature exploitation How can they become efficient if not fifty per cent of them have twelve months schooling How can we ever hope to make them efficient unless we preserve for them intact and sacred the prolonged childhood on the basis of which humanity has risen to the level of civilization it occupies today

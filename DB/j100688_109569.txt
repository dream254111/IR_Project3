FOUND IN FRUITS IN WHICH IT IS MODIFIED BY SUGAR AND ACIDS THAT HE HAS FOUND IT IN GREAT ABUNDANCE IN THE JUICE OF SLOES AND THAT A FRIEND OF HIS HAD DISCOVERED ITS PRESENCE EVEN IN PORT WINE IT ALSO APPEARS THAT IT MAY EXIST IN A STATE OF COMBINATION IN DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES IN WHICH ITS PRESENCE CANNOT BE MADE EVIDENT BY THE COMMON MEANS OF SOLUTIONS OF GELATINE AND THAT IN THESE CASES IN ORDER TO DETECT ITS EXISTENCE IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE ACTION OF DI LUTED ACIDS GENERAL OBSERVATIONSAFTER A FEW STRICTURES CONCERNING A CON JECTURE OF MR PROUST THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF THE TANNING PRINCIPLE POSSESSED OF DIFFERENT PROPERTIES AND DIFFERENT POWERS OF ACTING UPON REAGENTS FROM WHICH OUR AUTHOR THINKS HIMSELF AUTHO RIZED TO DISSENT HE DRAWS THE GENERAL CONCLUSIONTHAT IN ALL THE DIF FERENT ASTRINGENT INFUSIONS THE TANNING PRINCIPLE IS FOUND POSSESSED OF THE SAME GENERAL PROPERTIES AND POWERS OF COMBINATION IN ALL INSTANCES IT IS CAPABLE OF ENTERING INTO UNION WITH THE ACIDS ALKALIES AND EARTHS AND OF FORMING INSOLUBLE COMPOUNDS WITH GELATINE AND WITH SKIN THAT IN THE PROCESSES OF TANNING IF THE ASTRINGENT IN FUSION CONTAIN EXTRACTIVE AND COLOURING MATTER THESE AS WELL AS TANNIN ENTER INTO CHEMICAL COMBINATION WITH THE SKIN BUT THAT IN NO CASE IS THERE ANY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT GALLIC ACID IS ABLSORBED IN THIS PRO CESS THAT HENCE THE DIFFERENT QUALITIES OF LEATHER MADE WITHL THE SAME KIND OF SKIN SEEM TO DEPEND VERY MUCH UPON THE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF EXTRACTIVE AND COLOURING MATTER IT CONTAINS THE LEATHER PREPARED BY MEANS OF INFUSIONS OF GALLS BEING GENERALLY FOUND HARDER AND MORE LIABLE TO CRACK THAN THAT OBTAINED FROM THE INFUSIONS OF BARK WHEN SKINS ARE SLOWLY TANNED IN WEAK SOLUTIONS OF THE BARKS OR OF EXTRACT OF CATECHU IT COMBINES WITH A CONSIDERABLE LROPORTION OF EXTRACTIVE MATTER WHEREBY IT IS RENDERED PERFECTLY INSOLUBLE IN WATER AND YET SOFT AND VERY STRONG THE INFERENCE PERHAPS THE MOST ES SENTIAL DEDUCED FROM THIS INQUIRY IS THAT OF ALL THE ASTRINGENT SUB STANCES AS YET EXAMINED THE EXTRACTS OF CATECHU ARE THOSE THAT CON TAIN THE LARGEST PROPORTION OF TANNIN HALF A POUND OF THIS EXTRACT BEING FOUND TO PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT IN TANNING AS FROM FOUR TO FIVE POUNDS OF COMMON OAK BARK HOW MATERIAL THIS MUST BE IN A COUNTRY WHERE OAK TIMBER IS NOT AN OBJECT OF TRIVIAL IMPORTANCE NEED NOT BE HERE INSISTED UPONTHE PAPER CLOSES WITLL A TABLE IN WHICH OAK BARK BEING TAKEN AS THE STANDARD OF COMPARISON AS TO ITS QUANTITY OF TANNIN THE DIFFERENT ASTRINGENT SUBSTANCES ARE ARRANGED IN THE ORDER OF THEIR POWERS ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE DESCENT OF THE SAP IN TREES IN A LETTER FROM THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT ESQ TO THE RIGHT LON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KB PRS READ APRIL 21 1803 PHIL TRANS 1803 P 2771 IN A FORMER PAPER MR KNIGHT RELATED SOME EXPERIMENTS ON TREES FROM WHICH HE INFERRED THAT THEIR SAPL HAVING BEEN ABSORBED BY THE119 BARK OF THE ROOT IS CARRIED UP BY THE ALBURNUM OR WHITE WOOD OF THE ROOT THE TRUNK AND THE BRANCHES THAT IT PASSES THROUGH WHAT HE CALLS THE CENTRAL VESSELS INTO THE SUCCULENT PART OF THE ANNUAL SHOOT THE LEAFSTALK AND THE LEAF AND THAT IT THENCE RETURNS TO THE BARK THROUGH THE RETURNING VESSELS OF THE LEAFSTALK THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO POINT OUT THE CAUSES OF THE DESCENT OF THE SAP THLROUGH THE BARK AND THE CONSEQUENT FORMATION OF WOOD THE CAUSES TO WHICH HE ASCRIBES THIS DESCENT ARE 1 GRAVITATION 2 MOTION COMMUNICATED BY WINDS OR OTHER AGENTS AND 3 CAPIL LARY ATTRACTION AND PERHAPS SOME PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE CON FORMATION OF THE VESSELS THEMSELVES WHICH RENDERS THEM BETTER CAL CULATED TO CARRY FLUIDS IN ONE DIRECTION THAN IN ANOTHER BEFORE HE PROCEEDS UPON THE EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH HE LIAS DE DUCED THESE CONCLUSIONS HE PREMISES A FEW OBSERVATIONS ON THE FUNC TIONS OF THE LEAF FROM WHICH ALL THE DESCENDING FLUIDS IN THE TREE AP PEAR TO BE DERIVED HE DESCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT HE MADE ON A LEAF OF A VINE IN WHICH ITS LOWER SURFACE BEING PLACED IN CONTACT WITH A CLEAN PIECE OF PLATE GLASS THIS GLASS WAS SOON FOUND TO BE COVERED WITH A STRONG DEW WHICH HAD EVIDENTLY EXHALED FROM THE LEAF AND AT THE END OF HALF AN HOUR SO MUCH WATER WAS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED FROM THE LEAF THAT IT RAN FROM THE GLASS WHEN IT WAS HELD OBLIQUELY THE POSITION OF THE LEAF BEING THEN INVERTED AND ITS UPPER SURFACE BEING BROUGHT IN CONTACT WITH THE GLASS NOT THE SLIGHTEST PORTION OF MOISTURE APPEARED ALTHOUGH THE LEAF WAS FOR SOME TIME EXPOSED TO THE FULL INFLUENCE OF THE MERIDIAN SUN HENCE IT IS IN FERRED THAT THE VESSELS INTENDED FOR PERSPIRATION ARE CONFINED TO THE UNDER SURFACE OF THE LEAF AND THAT THESE LIKE THE CUTANEOUS LYM PHATICS OF THE ANIMAL OECONOMY ARE ALSO CAPABLE OF ABSORBING MOIS TURE WHEN THE PLANT IS IN A STATE TO REQUIRE IT WHEREAS THE UPPER SURFACE SEEMS CHIEFLY FORMED FOR ABSORBING LIGHT AND IF ANYTHING EXHALE FROM IT IT IS PROBABLY VITAL AIR OR SOME OTHER PERMANENTLY ELASTIC FLUID REVERTING NOW TO THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF HIS PAPER THE AUTHOR DE SCRIBES AN EXPERIMENT ON A SHOOT OF A VINE WHICH HE BENT DOWNWARDS NEARLY IN A PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION AFTER IT HAD GROWN SOLME TIME IN THIS POSITION AND ACQUIRED A LIGNEOUS TEXTURE HE STRIPPED THE BARK FROM A PART OF IT AND THUS CUT OFF ALL COMMUNICATION THROUGH THE BARK BETWEEN THE SHOOT AND THE PARENT STEM FORMER EXPERIMENTS HAVE SHOWN THAT HAD THIS SHOOT GROWN IN ITS ERECT POSITION THE LIP OF THE BARK ABOVE THE WOUND WOULD HAVE SHOWN AN ACCUMULATION OF FRESH WOOD AND BARK BUT IN THIS INSTANCE THE CONTRARY WAS FOUND TO BE THE CASE THE LIP NEXT TO THE STEM WHICH BY ITS POSITION WAS NOW UPPERMOST GAVE EVIDENT SIGNS OF THIS ACCUMULATION THIS IS ASCRIBED TO THE GRAVITATION OF THE SAP FROM THE CURVATURE OF THE SHOOT DOWN TO THE LIP THE RESULT OF THIS EXPERIMENT SEEMS TO POINT OUT ONE OF THE CAUSES WHY PERPENDICULAR SHOOTS GROW WITH MUCH GREATER VIGOUR THAN THOSE WHICH ARE INCLINED OR HORIZONTAL THEY HAVING PROBABLY A MORE PERFECT AND RAPID CIRCULATION THE EFFECT OF MOTION ON THE CIRCULATION OF THE SAP WAS DEDUCED120 FROM THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENT SEVERAL YOUNG STANDARD APPLETREES WERE BY MEANS OF STAKES AND BANDAGES PREVENTED FROM YIELDING TO THE IMPULSE OF THE WIND UP TO ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF THEIR STEMS THE UPPER PARTS OF THE STEMS AND THE BRANCHES BEING LEFT IN THEIR FREE NA TURAL STATE IN THE COURSE OF ONE SUMMER IT WAS FOUND THAT MUCH NEW WOOD HAD ACCUMULATED IN THE PARTS WHICH WERE KEPT IN MOTION BY THE WIND WHEREAS THE LOWER PARTS OF THE STEMS AND ROOTS HAD INCREASED VERY LITTLE IN SIZE ONE OF THESE TREES WAS AFTERWARDS CON FINED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT COULD ONLY MOVE IN ONE DIRECTION VIZ NORTH AND SOUTH THUS CIRCUMSTANCED THE DIAMETER OF THE TREE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH IN THAT PART OF THE STEM WHICH WAS MOST EXERCISED BY THE WIND EXCEEDED THAT IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN THE FOLLOWING AUTUMN IN THE PROPORTION OF 13 TO 11 SEVERAL CURIOUS INFERENCES MAY BE HENCE DEDUCED AS TO THE GROWTH OF TREES IN DIFFERENT SITUATIONS IN THOSE WHICH ARE EXPOSED ON HIGH GROUNDS AND ARE KEPT IN AL MOST CONTINUAL MOTION THE SAP CIRCULATES WITH GREAT RAPIDITY AND WILL BE ACCUMULATED CHIEFLY IN THE ROOTS AND LOWER PARTS OF THE TRUNK AND HENCE THE DIAMETER OF THE TRUNK WILL DIMINISH RAPIDLY AS IT RE CEDES FROM THE ROOT THE PROGRESS OF THE ASCENDING SAP WILL OF COURSE BE IMPEDED AND IT WILL THENCE CAUSE LATERAL BRANCHES TO BE PRODUCED THE FORMS OF WHICH WILL BE SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE TRUNK AND THUS THE GROWTH OF AN INSULATED TREE ON A MOUNTAIN WILL BE AS WE ALWAYS FIND IT LOW AND STURDY AND WELL CALCULATED TO RESIST THE HEAVY GALES TO WHICH FROM ITS SITUATION IT IS CONSTANTLY EXPOSED TREES ON THE OTHER HAND WHICH GROW IN CLUMPS OR SHELTERED SITUATIONS WHERE FOR WANT OF MOTION THE SAP IS RETARDED BOTH IN ITS ASCENT AND DESCENT WILL ACQUIRE A VERY DIFFERENT HABIT AND EVEN THEIR WOOD A DIFFERENT TEXTURE INSOMUCH THAT A GREAT DEAL OF THE TIMBER FOUND IN OLD BUILD INGS IN AND ABOUT LONDON WHICH HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONSIDERED AS SPANISH CHESTNUT APPEAR ON CLOSE EXAMINATION TO BE MOST EVIDENTLY FOREST OAK WHEN A TREE IS WHOLLY DEPRIVED OF MOTION IT OFTEN BE COMES UNHEALTHY AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY PERISHES APPARENTLY OWING TO THE STAGNATION OF THE DESCENDING SAP UNDER THE RIGID CONFINEMENT OF THE LIFELESS EXTERNAL BARK STRIPPING OFF THIS BARK HAS BEEN FOUND SINGULARLY BENEFICIAL TOWARDS THE INCREASE BOTH OF THE TRUNK AND BRANCHES AS TO THE THIRD CAUSE OF THE DESCENT OF SAP VIZ THE CAPILLARY AT TRACTION AND PECULIAR CONFORMATION OF THE VESSELS THOUGH THE AL BURNUM CONSISTING OF SUCH CAPILLARY TUBES AND VESSELS APPEARS MANI FESTLY TO EXPAND AND CONTRACT UNDER THE VARIOUS CHANGES OF TEMPERA TURE AND MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE AND THOUGH THE MOTION THUS PRODUCED MUST BE IN SOME DEGREE COMMUNICATED TO THE BARK AND OTHER CONTIGUOUS PARTS YET COMBINING THE RESULTS OF ALL HIS EXPERI MENTS OUR AUTHOR IS INCLINED TO CONSIDER GRAVITATION AS THE MOST EX TENSIVE AND ACTIVE CAUSE OF MOTION IN THE DESCENDING FLUIDS OF TREES AN OBSERVATION WHICH CORROBORATES HIS ASSERTION IS THAT IF THE SAP IMPELLED BY CAUSES MORE POWERFUL THAN GRAVITATION WERE TO PASS AND RETURN AS FREELY IN THE HORIZONTAL AND PENDENT AS IN THE PERPENDICULAR BRANCHES THE GROWTH OF EACH WOULD BE EQUALLY RAPID OR NEARLY SO121 AND THE HORIZONTEAL BRANCHES WOULD HENCE SOON EXTEND SO FAR AND BE COME SO BULKY AS TO RENDER IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE TRUNK TO SUPPORT THEM THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE HERE ASCRIBED TO THE HORIZONTAL AND SPREAD ING BRANCHES IS TO NOURISH AND SUPPORT THE BLOSSOMS AND FRUIT OR SEED LITTLE OR NOTHING OF THE SAP BEING HERE RETURNED TO THE PARENT TREE AND HENCE VERY FEEBLE POWERS BEING WANTED IN THE RETURNING SYSTEM OUR AUTHOR HAD LONG ENTERTAINED AN OPINION THAT THE ASCENDING FLUIDS IN THE ALBURNUM AND CENTRAL VESSELS ARE EVERYWHERE THE SAME AND THAT THE LEAFSTALK THE TENDRIL OF THE VINE THE FRUITSTALK AND THE SUCCULENT POINT OF THE ANNUAL SHOOT MIGHT IN SOME MEASURE BE SUBSTITUTED FOR EACH OTHER EXPERIMENTS HAVE PROVED HIS CONJECTURE IN MANY INSTANCES TO BE WELL FOUNDED IN SEVERAL OF THESE EXPERI MENTS LEAVES CONTINUED TO PERFORM THEIR OFFICE WHEN GRAFTED ON THE FRUITSTALK THE TENDRIL AND THE SUCCULENT SHOOT OF THE VINE AND THE LEAFSTALK THE TENDRIL AND THE FRUITSTALK EQUALLY SUPPLIED A BRANCH GRAFTED UPON THEM WITH NOURISHMENT ON EXAMINING THE MANNER IN WHICH WOUNDS IN TREES BECOME CO VERED AN ADDITIONAL PROOF WAS FOUND THAT THE MEDULLARY PROCESSES NAMELY THE KNOBS OF WOOD FORMED AT THE JUNCTION OF A GRAFTED BUD WITH THE STOCK IN WHICH IT IS INSERTED ARE LIKE EVERY OTHER PART OF THE WOOD GENERATED BY THE BARK THIS IS MENTIONED IN CONTRADICTION TO THE OPINION STILL ENTERTAINED THAT THE HARDEST MOST DURABLE AND MOST SOLID PART OF THE WOOD IS COMPOSED OF THE SOFT CELLULAR AND PERISHABLE SUBSTANCE OF THE MEDULLA LASTLY SOME OBSERVATIONS ARE STATED WHICH SEEM TO IMPLY THAT THE SAP IN ITS DESCENT MAY UNDERGO SOME MODIFICATION WHICH FITS IT MORE EFFECTUALLY TO PRODUCE WOOD A FEW REMARKS ON THE FORMATION OF BUDS IN TUBEROUS ROOTED PLANTS BENEATH THE GROUND ARE ADDED BY WAY OF APPENDIX THESE IF THE ABOVE THEORY BE TRUE MUST BE FORMED OF MATTER WHICH HAS DESCENDED FROM THE LEAVES THROUGH THE BARK AN EXPERIMENT WAS MADE ON A POTATOE PLANT BY INTERSECTING ITS RUNNERS WHICH CONNECT THE TUBERS WITH THE PARENT PLANT AND IMMERSING THEIR ENDS IN A DECOCTION OF LOGWOOD IN ABOUT TWENTY HOURS IT WAS FOUND THAT THE DECOCTION HAD INDEED PASSED ALONG THE RUNNERS IN BOTH DIRECTIONS BUT THAT NONE HAD ENTERED THE VESSELS OF THE PARENT PLANT IHIS RESULT WAS NOT UN EXPECTED TO THE AUTHOR HE BEING WELL AWARE THAT THE MATTER BY WHICH THE GROWING TUBER IS FED MUST DESCEND FROM THE LEAVES THROUGH THE BARK AND THAT BARK CANNOT ABSORB COLOURED INFUSIONS INQUIRIES

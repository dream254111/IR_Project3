J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011902,PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED OCCUPATIONS,I242634,PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED OCCUPATIONS BY KELLY MILLER LLD DEAN HOWARD UNIVERSITY WASHINGTON D C THE WORLDS WORKERS MAY BE DIVIDED INTO TWO WELLDEFINED CLASSES 1 THOSE WHO ARE CONCERNED IN THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRI BUTION OF WEALTH AND 2 THOSE WHOSE FUNCTION IS TO REGULATE THE PHYSICAL INTELLECTUAL MORAL SPIRITUAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE PEOPLE THE SUSTAINING ELEMENT INCLUDES WORKERS IN THE FIELD OF AGRICULTURE DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL SERVICE TRADE AND TRANSPORTATION AND IN MANUFACTURING AND MECHANICAL PURSUITS THE GOVERNING CLASS COM PRISES GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS MINISTERS TEACHERS PHYSICIANS LAWYERS EDITORS AND AUTHORS THE GREAT BULK OF THE POPULATION REPRESENT ING THE TOILING MASSES IS FOUND UNDER THE FIRST HEAD WHILE A COM PARATIVELY SMALL NUMBER IS REQUIRED FOR THE SOCALLED LEARNED PRO FESSIONS IN THE UNITED STATES THE TWO ELEMENTS ARE DIVIDED IN THE APPROXIMATE RATIO OF TWENTY TO ONE TRADITIONALLY THESE TWO CLASSES HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BY A WIDE AND DEEP SOCIAL GULF ALL HONOR AND GLORY HAVE ATTACHED TO THE HIGHER PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS WHILE THOSE WHO RECRUITED THE RANKS OF THE TOILING WORLD HAVE BEEN AC CORDED A DISTINCTIVELY LOWER ORDER OF CONSIDERATION AND ESTEEM THE YOUTH WHO WERE MOST HIGHLY GIFTED BY NATURE OR FAVORED BY FORTUNE NATURALLY SOUGHT CAREERS IN THE GENTEEL PROFESSIONS LEAVING THOSE OF LESSER GIFTS AND LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO RECRUIT THE RANKS OF THE LOWER ORDER OF SERVICE PRESENT TENDENCY HOWEVER IS AGAINST THIS HARD AND FAST DEMARCATION DISTINCTION IS MADE TO DEPEND UPON SUCCESS AND SUCCESS UPON EFFICIENCY REGARDLESS OF THE NATURE OF THE PURSUIT OR VOCATION HONOR AND SHAME NO LONGER ATTACH TO STATED OCCUPATIONS OR CALLINGS BUT DEPEND UPON ACHIEVEMENT IN WORK RATHER THAN IN CHOICE OF TASK THE NEGRO WAS INTRODUCED INTO THIS COUNTRY FOR THE PURPOSE OF PERFORMING MANUAL AND MENIAL LABOR IT WAS THOUGHT THAT FOR ALL TIME TO COME HE WOULD BE A SATISFIED AND CONTENTED HEWER OF WOOD DRAWER OF WATER AND TILLER OF THE SOIL HE WAS SUPPOSED TO REPRESENT A LOWER ORDER OF CREATION A LITTLE MORE THAN ANIMAL AND A LITTLE LESS 10PROFESSIONAL AND SKITTFD OCCUPATIONS THAN HUMAN THE DOMINANT DOGMA OF THAT DAY DENIED HIM CAPAC ITY OR ASPIRATION TO RISE ABOVE THE LOWEST LEVEL OF MENIAL SERVICE HE WAS DEEMED DESTINED TO EVERLASTING SERVILITY BY DIVINE DECREE HIS PLACE WAS FIXED AND HIS SPHERE DEFINED IN THE COSMIC SCHEME OF THINGS THERE WAS NO MORE THOUGHT THAT HE WOULD OR COULD EVER ASPIRE TO THE RANKS OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS THAN THAT LIKE AMBITION WOULD EVER ACTUATE THE LOWER ANIMALS MUCH OF THIS TRADITIONAL BIAS IS BROUGHT FORWARD AND REAPPEARS IN THE PRESENT DAY ATTITUDE ON THE RACE PROBLEM THERE STILL LINGERS A RAPIDLY DIMINISHING REMNANT OF INFALLIBLE PHILOSOPHERS WHO ASSUME INTIMATE ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE DECREES OF THE ALMIGHTY AND LOUDLY ASSERT THAT THE NEGRO IS GODORDAINED TO EVERLASTING INFERIORITY BUT THOSE WHO ASSUME FORE KNOWLEDGE WITH SUCH SELFSATISFIED ASSURANCE PRUDENTLY ENOUGH FAIL TO TELL US OF THEIR SECRET MEANS OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE DIVINE PLANS AND PURPOSES THEY DO NOT REPRESENT THE CALIBRE OF MIND ORQUALITY OF SPIRIT THROUGH WHICH SUCH REVELATION IS USUALLY VOUCHSAFED TO MAN FROM THIS SCHOOL OF OPINION THE NEGROS ASPIRATION TO ENTER THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS IS MET WITH RIDICULE AND CONTEMPT THE TIME MONEY AND EFFORT SPENT UPON THE PRODUCTION AND PREPARATION OF THIS CLASS HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN WASTED BECAUSE THEY TEND TO SUBVERT THE ORDAINED PLAN HIGHER EDUCATION IS DECRIED INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION OR RATHER THE TRAINING OF THE HAND IS ADVISED AS THE HAND IS CONSIDERED THE ONLY INSTRUMENT THROUGH WHICH THE BLACK MAN CAN FULFILL HIS APPOINTED MISSION BUT SOCIAL FORCES LIKE NATURAL LAWS PAY LITTLE HEED TO THE NOI SOME DECLARATION OF PRECONCEIVED OPINION THE INHERENT CAPACITIES OF HUMAN NATURE WILL ASSERT THEMSELVES DESPITE THE DENIAL OF THE DOCTRINAIRE THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE NEGRO DURING THE PAST FIFTY YEARS HAS BELIED EVERY PREDICTION PROPOUNDED BY THIS DOLEFUL SCHOOL OF PHILOSOPHY AFFIRMED IMPOSSIBILITIES HAVE COME TO PASS THE NEVER OF YESTERDAY HAS BECOME THE ACTUALITY OF TODAY IN A HOMOGENEOUS SOCIETY WHERE THERE IS NO RACIAL CLEAVAGE ONLY THE SELECT MEMBERS OF THE MOST FAVORED CLASS OF SOCIETY OCCUPY THE PROFESSIONAL STATIONS THE ELEMENT REPRESENTING THE SOCIAL STATUS OF THE NEGRO WOULD FURNISH FEW MEMBERS OF THE COVETED CALLINGS THE ELEMENT OF RACE HOWEVER COMPLICATES EVERY FEATURE OF THE SOCIAL EQUATION IN INDIA WE ARE TOLD THE POPULATION IS DIVIDED HORIZONTALLY BY CASTE AND VERTICALLY BY RELIGION BUT IN AMERICA THE RACE SPIRIT SERVES AS BOTH A HORIZONTAL AND A VERTICAL SEPARATION 11THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE NEGRO IS SEGREGATED AND SHUT INTO HIMSELF IN ALL SOCIAL AND SEMI SOCIAL RELATIONS OF LIFE THIS ISOLATION NECESSITATES SEPARATE MINIS TRATIVE AGENCIES FROM THE LOWEST TO THE HIGHEST RUNGS OF THE LADDER OF SERVICE DURING THE DAYS OF SLAVERY THE INTEREST OF THE MASTER DEMANDED THAT HE SHOULD DIRECT THE GENERAL SOCIAL AND MORAL LIFE OF THE SLAVE THE SUDDEN SEVERENCE OF THIS TIE LEFT THE NEGRO WHOLLY WITHOUT INTIMATE GUIDANCE AND DIRECTION THE IGNORANT MUST BE ENLIGHTENED THE SICK MUST BE HEALED THE POOR MUST HAVE THE GOSPEL PREACHED TO THEM THE WAYWARD MUST BE DIRECTED THE LOWLY MUST BE UPLIFTED AND THE SORROWING MUST BE SOLACED THE SITUATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE RACE FOUND ITSELF DEMANDEDL THAT ITS MINISTERS TEACHERS PHYSICIANS LAWYERS AND EDITORS SHOULD FOR THE MOST PART BE MEN OF THEIR OWN BLOOD AND SYMPATHIES THE DE MANDS FOR A PROFESSIONAL CLASS WERE IMPERATIVE THE NEEDED SERVICE COULD NOT BE EFFECTIVELY PERFORMED BY THOSE WHO ASSUME AND ASSERT RACIAL ARROGANCE AND HAND DOWN THEIR BENEFACTIONS AS THE COLD CRUMBS THAT FALL FROM THE MASTERS TABLE THE HELP THAT IS TO BE HELPFUL TO THE LOWLY AND THE HUMBLE MUST COME FROM THE HORIZONTAL HAND STRETCHED OUT IN FRATERNAL GOOD WILL AND NOT THE ONE THAT IS POINTED SUPERCILIOUSLY DOWNWARD THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS WHO ARE TO UPLIFT AND DIRECT THE LOWLY AND HUMBLE MUST NOT SAY SO FAR SHALT THOU COME BUT NO FARTHER BUT RATHER WHERE I AM THERE YE SHALL BE ALSO THERE IS NO MORE PATHETIC CHAPTER IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN STRUGGLE THAN THE SMOTHERED AND SUPPRESSED AMBITION OF THIS RACE IN ITS DARING ENDEAVOR TO MEET THE GREATEST SOCIAL EXIGENCY TO SUPPLY THE PROFESSIONAL DEMAND OF THE MASSES THERE WAS THE SUDDENNESS AND SWIFTNESS OF LEAP AS WHEN A QUANTITY IN MATHEMATICS CHANGES SIGNS IN PASSING THROUGH ZERO OR INFINITY IN AN INSTANT IN THE TWINK LING OF AN EYE THE PLOWHAND WAS TRANSFORMED INTO THE PRIEST THE BARBER INTO THE BISHOP THE HOUSEMAID INTO THE SCHOOLMISTRESS THE PORTER INTO THE PHYSICIAN AND THE DAYLABORER INTO THE LAWYER THESE HIGH PLACES OF INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL AUTHORITY INTO WHICH THEY FOUND THEMSELVES THRUST BY STRESS OF SOCIAL NECESSITY HAD TO BE OPERATED WITH AT LEAST SOME SEMBLANCE OF CONFORMITY WITH THE STANDARDS WHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE EUROPEAN THROUGH THE TRADITIONS OF THE AGES THE HIGH PLACES IN SOCIETY OCCUPIED BY THE CHOICEST MEMBERS OF THE WHITE RACE AFTER YEARS OF PRELIMINARY PREP ARATION HAD TO BE ASSUMED BY MEN WITHOUT PERSONAL OR FORMAL FITNESS 12PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED OCCUPATIONS THE STRONGER AND MORE AGGRESSIVE NATURES PUSHED THEMSELVES INTO THESE HIGH CALLINGS BY SHEER FORCE OF UNTUTORED ENERGY AND UNCON TROLLED AMBITION THAT THERE WOULD NEEDS BE MUCH GROTESQUENESS MALADJUSTMENT AND FAILURES GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT AFTER MAKING FULL ALLOWANCE FOR HUMAN IMPERFECTIONS THE 50000 NEGROES WHO NOW FILL THE PROFESSIONAL PLACES AMONG THEIR RACE REPRESENT A REMARK ABLE BODY OF MEN AND INDICATE THE POTENCY AND PROMISE OF THE RACE THE FEDERAL CENSUS OF 1900 FURNISHES THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA OF THE NUMBER OF NEGROES ENGAGED IN THE SEVERAL PRODUCTIVE AND PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS ALLOWANCE OF COURSE MUST BE MADE FOR GROWTH IN SEVERAL DEPART MENTS DURING THE INTERVENING THIRTEEN YEARS NEGROES ENGAGED IN PRODUCTIVE AND DISTRIBUTIVE PURSUITS 1900 AGRICULTURE   2143154 DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL SERVICE 1317859 TRADE AND TRANSPORTATION  208989 MANUFACTURING

PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS WHEREAS 1 WHITE PERSON IN 20 IS FOUND IN THIS CLASS ACCORDING TO THIS STANDARD THE NEGRO HAS LESS THAN ONEFOURTH OF HIS PROFESSIONAL QUOTA 13THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE NEGRO MINISTRY WAS THE FIRST PROFESSIONAL BODY TO ASSUME FULL CONTROL AND DIRECTION OF THE MORAL AND SPIRITUAL LIFE OF THE MASSES AS SOON AS THE BLACK WORSHIPPER GAINED A CONSCIOUS SENSE OF SELF RESPECT WHICH THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION IS SURE TO IMPART HE BECAME DISSATISFIED WITH THE ASSIGNED SEATS IN THE SYNAGOGUE THE BACK PEWS AND UPPER GALLERIES DID NOT SEEM COMPATIBLE WITH THE DIGNITY OF THOSE WHO HAD BEEN BAPTIZED INTO THE FELLOWSHIP AND COMMUNION OF THE SAINTS WITH THE ENCOURAGEMENT OF THE WHITES THE NEGRO WORSHIPPERS SOON SET UP THEIR OWN SEPARATE HOUSES OF WORSHIP THERE AROSE A PRIESTHOOD AFTER THE MANNER OF MELCHIZEDEK WITHOUT ANTECEDENT OR PREPARATION BUT NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR DISABILI TIES THESE COMPARATIVELY IGNORANT AND UNTRAINED MEN HAVE SUC CEEDED IN ORGANIZING THE ENTIRE NEGRO RACE INTO DEFINITE RELIGIOUS BODIES AND DENOMINATIONAL AFFILIATIONS THE BAPTIST AND METHODIST DENOMINATIONS WHICH OPERATE ON THE BASIS OF ECCLESISATICAL INDEPEN DENCE HAVE PRACTICALLY BROUGHT THE ENTIRE RACE UNDER THEIR SPIRITUAL DOMINION THIS IS THE ONE CONSPICUOUS ACHIEVEMENT PLACED TO THE CREDIT OF THE RACE BY WAY OF HANDLING LARGE INTERESTS PASSING OVER THE INEVITABLE IMPERFECTIONS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RELIGIOUS LIFE OF THE RACE THE GREAT OUTSTANDING FACT REMAINS THAT THIS VAST RELI GIOUS ESTATE COMPRISING 30000 CHURCH ORGANIZATIONS WITH A MEMBER SHIP OF OVER 3500000 COMMUNICANTS UPON A PROPERTY BASIS OF 56000000 HAS BEEN ORGANIZED AND HANDED DOWN TO THE RISING GEN ERATION AS ITS MOST PRICELESS INHERITANCE THE NEGRO CHURCH IS NOT MERELY A RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION BUT COMPRISES ALL THE COMPLEX FEATURES OF THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE IT FURNISHES THE ONLY FIELD IN WHICH THE NEGRO HAS SHOWN INITIATIVE AND EXECUTIVE ENERGY ON A LARGE SCALE THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH THE MASSES OF THE RACE WITH ANY BENEFICENT MIN ISTRATIONS EXCEPT THROUGH THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT THESE CHURCHES HAVE ESTABLISHED THE STATESMANSHIP AND PHILANTHROPY OF THE NATION WOULD DO WELL TO RECOGNIZE THIS FACT INDEED IT IS SERIOUSLY TO BE QUES TIONED IF ANY BELATED PEOPLE IN THE PRESENT STATUS OF THE NEGRO CAN BE WISELY GOVERNED WITHOUT THE ELEMENT OF PRIESTCRAFT BROADLY SPEAKING THE NEGRO IS HARDLY GOVERNED AT ALL BY THE STATE BUT MERELY COERCED AND BEATEN INTO OBEDIENCE HE IS NOT ENCOURAGED TO HAVE ANY COMPREHENSIVE UNDERSTANDING OF OR PARTICIPATING HAND IN THE BENEFICENT AIMS AND OBJECTS OF GOVERNMENT THE SHERIFF AND THE TRIAL JUDGE ARE THE ONLY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WITH WHOM HE IS FAMILIAR AND HE MEETS WITH THESE ONLY WHEN HIS LIFE OR HIS PROPERTY 14PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED OCCUPATIONS IS IN JEOPARDY IF IT WERE NOT FOR THE CHURCH THE GREAT MASS OF THE NEGRO RACE WOULD BE WHOLLY SHUT OFF FROM ANY ORGANIZED INFLUENCE TOUCHING THEM WITH SYMPATHETIC INTENT AS IMPERFECT AS THE NEGRO CHURCH MUST BE IN MANY OF ITS FEATURES IT IS THE MOST POTENTIAL UPLIFTING AGENCY AT WORK AMONG THE PEOPLE ELIMINATE THE CHURCH AND THE MASSES OF THE PEOPLE WOULD SPEEDILY LAPSE INTO A STATE OF MORAL AND SOCIAL DEGENERATION WORSE THAN THAT FROM WHICH THEY ARE SLOWLY EVOLVING THE GREAT PROBLEM IN THE UPLIFT OF THE RACE MUST BE APPROACHED THROUGH THE PULPIT THE NEGRO PREACHER IS THE SPOKES MAN AND LEADER OF THE PEOPLE HE DERIVES HIS SUPPORT FROM THEM AND SPEAKS OR OUGHT TO SPEAK WITH THE POWER AND AUTHORITY OF THE MASSES HE WILL BE THE DAYSMAN AND PEACEMAKER BETWEEN THE RACES AND IN HIS HANDS IS THE KEEPING OF THE KEY OF THE DESTINY OF THE RACE IF THESE 30000 PULPITS COULD BE FILLED IN THIS GENERATION BY THE BEST INTELLIGENCE CHARACTER AND CONSECRATION WITHIN THE RACE ALL OF ITS COMPLEX PROBLEMS WOULD BE ON A FAIR WAY TOWARDS SOLUTION THE IGNORANCE OF THE MINISTRY OF THE PASSING GENERATION WAS THE KIND OF IGNORANCE THAT GOD UTILIZES AND WINKS AT BUT HE WILL NOT EXCUSE OR WINK AT ITS CONTINUANCE IT IS A SAD DAY FOR ANY RACE WHEN THE BEST THEY BREED DO NOT ASPIRE TO THE HIGHEST AND HOLIEST AS WELL AS THE MOST INFLUENTIAL CALLINGS BUT IT WILL BE SADDER STILL FOR A RETARDED RACE IF ITS MINISTRY REMAINS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO ARE ILLY PREPARED TO EXERCISE ITS HIGH FUNCTIONS THE RISE OF THE COLORED TEACHER IS DUE TO THE OUTCOME OF THE CIVIL WAR THE SOUTH SOON HIT UPON THE PLAN OF THE SCHOLASTIC SEPARATION OF THE RACES AND ASSIGNED COLORED TEACHERS TO COLORED SCHOOLS AS THE BEST MEANS OF CARRYING OUT THIS POLICY THERE WERE AT FIRST A GREAT MANY WHITE TEACHERS MAINLY FROM THE NORTH BUT IN TIME THE TASK OF ENLIGHTENING THE MILLIONS OF NEGRO CHILDREN HAS DEVOLVED UPON TEACHERS OF THEIR OWN RACE IT WAS INEVITABLE THAT MANY OF THE TEACHERS FOR WHOM THERE WAS SUCH A SUDDEN DEMAND SHOULD BE POORLY PREPARED FOR THEIR WORK IT WAS AND STILL IS A TRAVESTY UPON TERMS TO SPEAK OF SUCH WORK AS MANY OF THEM ARE ABLE TO RENDER AS PROFESSIONAL SERVICE AMONG THE WHITE RACE THE TEACHER HAS NOT YET GAINED THE FUL NESS OF STATURE AS A MEMBER OF THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS THEY DO NOT CONSTITUTE A SELFDIRECTING BODY BOTH ARE CONTROLLED AS A COL LATERAL BRANCH OF THE STATE OR CITY GOVERNMENT OF WHICH THEY CON STITUTE A SUBORDINATE PART THE RANKS ARE RECRUITED MAINLY FROM 15THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FEMALE SEX IN CASE OF THE NEGRO TEACHER THESE LIMITATIONS ARE SEVERELY EMPHASIZED THE ORDERS AND DIRECTIONS COME FROM THE WHITE SUPERINTENDENT BUT THERE IS SOME LATITUDE OF JUDGMENT AND DISCRETION IN A WISE AND SENSIBLE ADAPTATION THE GREAT FUNCTION OF THE NEGRO TEACHER IS FOUND IN THE FACT THAT SHE HAS COMMITTED TO HER THE TRAINING OF THE MIND MANNERS AND METHOD OF THE YOUNG WHO ARE SOON TO TAKE THEIR PLACE IN THE RANKS OF THE CITIZENSHIP OF THE NATION WHILE THERE IS WANTING THE INDEPENDENT SCOPE WHICH THE PREACHER EXERCISES IN THE DOMAIN OF MORAL AND SPIRITUAL CONTROL NEVERTHELESS THE TEACHER EXERCISES A MOST IMPORTANT FUNCTION IN THE IMMEDIATE MATTERS COMMITTED TO HER THE NEGRO TEACHER HAS THE HARDEST AND HEAVIEST BURDEN OF ANY OTHER ELEMENT OF THE TEACHING PROFESSION EDUCATION MEANS MORE TO THE NEGRO THAN IT DOES TO THE WHITE CHILD WHO FROM INHERITANCE AND ENVIRONMENT GAINS A CER TAIN COEFFICIENCY OF POWER ASIDE FROM THE TECHNICAL ACQUISITION OF THE SCHOOL ROOM THE TEACHER OF THE NEGRO CHILD ON THE OTHER HAND MUST IMPART NOT ONLY THE LETTER BUT ALSO THE FUNDAMENTAL MEANING OF THE WAYS AND METHODS OF CIVILIZED LIFE SHE SHOULD HAVE A PREPARATION FOR WORK AND THE FIXED CONSECRATION TO DUTY COMMEN SURATE TO THE IMPOSED TASK THE COLORED DOCTOR HAS MORE RECENTLY ENTERED THE ARENA AT FIRST THE NEGRO PATIENT REFUSED TO PUT CONFIDENCE IN THE PHYSICIANS OF HIS OWN RACE NOTWITHSTANDING THE CLOSER INTIMACY OF SOCIAL CON TACT IT WAS ONLY AFTER HE HAD DEMONSTRATED HIS COMPETENCY TO TREAT DISEASE AS SKILLFULLY AS THE WHITE PRACTITIONER THAT HE WAS ABLE TO WIN RECOGNITION AMONG HIS OWN PEOPLE THE COLORED PHYSICIAN IS STILL IN OPEN COMPETITION WITH THE WHITE PHYSICIAN WHO NEVER REFUSES TO TREAT THE NEGRO PATIENT IF ALLOWED TO ASSUME THE DISDAIN FUL ATTITUDE OF RACIAL SUPERIORITY IF THE NEGRO DOCTOR DID NOT SECURE PRACTICALLY AS GOOD RESULTS IN TREATING DISEASE AS THE WHITE PRACTI TIONER HE WOULD SOON FIND HIMSELF WITHOUT PATIENTS HE MUST BE SUBJECT TO THE SAME PRELIMINARY TEST OF FITNESS FOR THE PROFESSION AND MUST MAINTAIN THE SAME STANDARD OF EFFICIENCY AND SUCCESS THE NEGRO PHYSICIANS REPRESENT THE ONLY BODY OF COLORED MEN WHO IN ADEQUATE NUMBERS MEASURE UP TO THE FULL SCIENTIFIC REQUIREMENTS OF A LEARNED PROFESSION BY REASON OF THE STRATUM WHICH THE NEGRO OCCUPIES IN OUR SOCIAL SCHEME THE RACE IS AN EASY PREY TO DISEASES THAT AFFECT THE HEALTH OF THE WHOLE NATION THE GERMS OF DISEASE HAVE NO RACE 16PROFESSIONAL AND SKILLED OCCUPATIONS PREJUDICE THEY DO NOT EVEN DRAW THE LINE AT SOCIAL EQUALITY THE GERM THAT AFFLICTS THE NEGRO TODAY WILL ATTACK THE WHITE MAN TO MORROW ONE TOUCH OF DISEASE MAKES THE WHOLE WORLD KIN AND ALSO KIND THE NEGRO PHYSICIAN COMES INTO IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH THE MASSES OF THE RACE HE IS A SANITARY MISSIONARY HIS MINIS TRATION IS NOT ONLY TO HIS OWN RACE BUT TO THE COMMUNITY AND TO THE NATION AS A WHOLE THE DREADED WHITE PLAGUE WHICH THE NATION DESIRES TO STAMP OUT BY CONCERTED ACTION SEEMS TO PREFER THE BLACK VICTIM THE NEGRO PHYSICIAN IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFICIENT AGENCIES IN HELPING TO STAMP OUT THIS DREAD ENEMY OF MANKIND HIS SUCCESS HAS BEEN LITTLE LESS THAN MARVELOUS IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY HE IS RENDERING EFFICIENT SERVICE AND IS ACHIEVING BOTH PROFESSIONAL AND FINANCIAL SUCCESS EDUCATED NEGRO MEN ARE CROWDING INTO THIS PRO FESSION AND WILL OF COURSE CONTINUE TO DO SO UNTIL THE DEMAND HAS BEEN FULLY SUPPLIED THE RACE CAN EASILY SUPPORT TWICE THE NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS NOW QUALIFIED TO PRACTICE THE NEGRO LAWYER HAS NOT GENERALLY BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS HIS MEDICAL CONFRERE THE RELATION BETWEEN ATTORNEY AND CLIENT IS NOT NECESSARILY CLOSE AND CONFIDENTIAL AS THAT OF PHYSICIAN AND PATIENT BUT IS MORE BUSINESSLIKE AND FORMAL THE CLIENTS INTERESTS ARE ALSO DEPENDENT UPON THE JUDGE AND JURY WITH WHOM THE WHITE ATTORNEY IS SOMETIMES SUPPOSED TO HAVE GREATER WEIGHT AND INFLUENCE FOR SUCH REASONS THERE ARE FEWER NEGROES IN THE PROFESSION OF LAW THAN IN THE OTHER SOCALLED LEARNED PROFESSIONS THE NEGRO LAWYER IS RAPIDLY WINNING HIS WAY OVER THE PREJUDICE OF BOTH RACES JUST AS THE DOCTOR HAS HAD TO DO THERE ARE TO BE FOUND IN EVERY COM MUNITY EXAMPLES OF THE NEGRO LAWYER WHO HAS WON RECOGNITION FROM BOTH RACES AND WHO MAINTAINS A HIGH STANDARD OF PERSONAL AND PROFESSIONAL SUCCESS A COLORED LAWYER WAS APPOINTED BY PRESIDENT TAFT AS ASSISTANT ATTORNEYGENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES AND BY UNIVERSAL TESTIMONY CONDUCTED THE AFFAIRS OF HIS OFFICE WITH THE REQUI SITE EFFICIENCY AND DIGNITY AS NEGRO ENTERPRISES MULTIPLY AND DE VELOP SUCH AS BANKS BUILDING ASSOCIATIONS AND INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE GENERAL PROSPERITY OF THE PEOPLE INCREASES THE NEGRO LAWYER WILL FIND AN INCREASING SPHERE OF USEFULNESS AND INFLUENCE NEGROES ARE ALSO FOUND IN ALL THE OTHER PROFESSIONAL PURSUITS AND FURNISH A SMALL QUOTA OF EDITORS ENGINEERS ELECTRICIANS AUTHORS AND ARTISTS MERCHANTS BANKERS AND BUSINESS MEN ARE RAPIDLY INCREASING IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY APPREHENSION IS SOMETIMES 17THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FELT THAT COLORED MEN WILL RUSH TO THE LEARNED PROFESSIONS TO THE NEGLECT OF THE HUMBLER LINES OF SERVICE THE FACTS SHOW THAT THE RACE AT PRESENT HAS NOT MORE THAN A FOURTH OF ITS QUOTA IN THE PRO FESSIONAL PURSUITS THE DEMAND WILL ALWAYS REGULATE THE SUPPLY WHEN THE DEMAND HAS BEEN SUPPLIED IN ANY PROFESSION THE OVERFLOW WILL SEEK OUTLET IN UNOCCUPIED FIELDS THE UPLIFT AND QUICKENING OF THE LIFE OF THE RACE DEPENDS UPON THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES THE EARLY PHILANTHROPIST IN THE SOUTHERN FIELD ACTED WISELY IN DEVELOPING LEADERS AMONG THE PEOPLE PHILAN THROPY AT BEST CAN ONLY FURNISH THE FIRST AID AND QUALIFY LEADERS THE LEADERS MUST THEN DO THE REST ANY RACE IS HOPELESS UNLESS IT DEVELOPS ITS OWN LEADERSHIP AND DIRECTION IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO APPLY PHILANTHROPY TO THE MASSES EXCEPT THROUGH THE PROFESSIONAL CLASSES THE HIGHER EDUCATION OF THE NEGRO IS JUSTIFIED BY THE REQUIRE MENTS OF THE LEADERS OF THE PEOPLE IT IS A GRAVE MISTAKE TO SUP POSE THAT BECAUSE THE NEGRO IS RELATIVELY BACKWARD AS COMPARED TO THE WHITE MAN HIS LEADERS NEED NOT HAVE THE BROADEST AND BEST EDUCATION THAT OUR CIVILIZATION AFFORDS THE MORE BACKWARD AND IGNORANT THE LED THE MORE SKILLED AND SAGACIOUS SHOULD THE LEADER BE IT REQUIRES MORE SKILL TO LEAD THE HELPLESS THAN TO GUIDE THOSE WHO NEED NO DIRECTION IF THE BLIND LEAD THE BLIND THEY WILL BOTH FALL INTO THE DITCH THE PROFESSIONAL CLASS CONSTITUTES THE LIGHT OF THE RACE THE NEGRO NEEDS HEADLIGHT TO GUIDE HIM SAFELY AND WISELY AMID THE DANGERS AND VICISSITUDES OF AN ENVIRONING CIVILIZATION THE NEGRO TEACHER MEETS WITH EVERY FORM OF IGNORANCE AND PEDAGOGICAL OBTUSENESS THAT BEFALLS THE WHITE TEACHER THE NEGRO PREACHER HAS TO DO WITH EVERY CONCEIVABLE FORM OF ORIGINAL AND ACQUIRED SIN THE DOCTOR MEETS WITH ALL THE VARIETY OF DISEASE THAT THE HUMAN FLESH IS HEIR TO THE LAWYERS SPHERE COVERS THE WHOLE GAMUT INVOLVING THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY AND PERSON THE PROBLEMS INVOLVED IN THE CONTACT ATTRITION AND ADJUSTMENT OF THE RACES INVOLVE ISSUES WHICH ARE AS INTRICATE AS ANY THAT HAVE EVER TAXED HUMAN WISDOM FOR SOLUTION IF THEN THE WHITE MAN WHO STANDS IN THE HIGH PLACE OF AUTHORITY AND LEADERSHIP AMONG HIS RACE FORTIFIED AS HE IS BY A SUPERIOR SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT NEEDS TO QUALIFY FOR HIS HIGH CALL ING BY THOROUGH AND SOUND EDUCATIONAL TRAINING SURELY THE NEGRO NEEDS A NO LESS THOROUGH GENERAL EDUCATION TO QUALIFY HIM TO SERVE AS PHILOSOPHER GUIDE AND FRIEND OF TEN MILLION UNFORTUNATE HUMAN BEINGS 18

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098617,Loss of Funds in Hands of the Court,i245868,728 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb CORRESPONDENCE LOSS OF FUNDS IN HANDS OF THE COURT Editor of the Virginia Law Register Referring to your comment on Patterson v Crawford in the REGISTER for Jan uary as to the holding of the court in that case in substance  that where there are priorities among the several creditors at whose suit the property is subjected and a portion of the fund is saved the same preference is to be observed as if there had been no lossin other words the loss must be borne in the inverse or der of the priorities and equality is not equity in such case I have to say that the previous case in Virginia bearing on this point as to the existence of which you say you have a shadowy impression is doubtless Gill v Barbour 80 Va p 11 which was cited in the briefs and received much attention in the oral argu ment in Patterson v Crawford Gill v Barbour is believed to be the only Virginia case bearing on this question prior to the decision of Patterson v Crawford You will observe that in Gill v Barbour the purchaser of the land owned all the debts binding the same save one and he deposited in bank with the approval of the court funds sufficient to pay this debt and such payment into court was re cognized as a payment or the equivalent of a payment to the creditor The bank failed and the fund was lost The court held that the loss should fall upon the owner of the lien In Gill v Barbour the contest was regarded as a contest between a purchaser who had paid all of his purchase money in the mode pre scribed by the court and a creditor whose debt was lost by the failure of the bank designated by the court as receiver of the fund In the syllabus of Gill v Barbour it is said Had there remained more than one unsatisfied lien the loss would then have fallen on the general fund and been borne by the lienors in the inverse order of the priorities of their liens and this seems to be borne out by the opinion of Lacy J See pages 16 and 17 of the opinion The court expressly says that the case last mentioned did not present the question of a contest between lienors as was strenuously insisted by the ap pellees The case of Patterson v Crawford did present just that question It is believed that the same court that decided Gill v Barbour would have de cided Patterson v Crawford just as it has been decided by the present court It seems to be conceded that in a case like the one under consideration the spe cial receiver appointed by the court for the collection and disbursement of the fund represents or acts for all the creditorsnot for one more than anotherand consequently any defalcation on his part is a loss to the fund as a whole and pro tanto diminishes the fund for distribution without disturbing the order of priority amongst the creditors the result being that those in the lowest class or classes must bear the loss Careful reflection it is believed will make it appear that no other general rule than that adopted by the court in Patterson v Crawford would work out satisfac tory resultsresults sanctioned by the analogies of the law Respectfully yours Staunton Va FITZHUGH ELDER

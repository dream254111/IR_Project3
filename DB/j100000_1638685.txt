urotropin can penetrate the follicular membrane and enter directly into the egg yolk since an egg which was laid five days after the last feeding with urotropin gave the test for formaldehyde Two other eggs were laid by the same hentwo and four days previouslyso that the abovementioned egg could not have obtained its formalin from albumen stored in the oviduct In this egg therefore only the yolk had been exposed to urotropin and it only could have been the source of the formalin Two other eggs of very similar history also gave positive tests for the presence of formalin in the yolk The eggs dosed with salicylate and less markedly those dosed with benzoate besides appearingsomewhat inconstantlyto be better preserved as judged by taste and smell often showed certain other physical contrasts with the control eggs For example the yolks of the control eggs more often showed ad hesions  to the shell than did the dosed eggs Of fifteen control eggs opened on October 12 and November 10 nine showed adhesions either to shell or to the membrane of the air cavity whereas on the same dates ten eggs dosed with salicylate and eight dosed with benzoate furnished altogether only three ad hesions Too the control eggs usually con tained the more liquid albumen a difference readily observed Finally it was often noted that there was present in the dosed eggs more of the dense whitish albumen of the chalazse than in the control Obviously all these physical differences strengthen the not very conclusive evidence of taste and smell that the eggs dosed with salicylate and benzoate had not undergone digestion and putrefaction to as great an ex tent as the normal untreated eggs Larger doses of these substances would prob ably yield more striking results Doses of 02 G of sodium benzoate were however oc casionally seen to be regurgitated by pigeons 1I am indebted to Mr Valentine Petzold an obliging poultryman of Chicago for the privilige of dosing five of his birds with sodium salicylate I do not believe that any part of either of these drugs was so disposed of by the fowls Actively laying hensas these weremight withstand considerably larger amounts Too still other substances can doubtless be found which will yield as good or better results when applied by this method But these questions and others are left to the labor of those who may be interested in the practical or economic possibilities of the matter OSCAR RIDDLE LABORATORY OF EXPERIMENTAL THERAPEUTICS UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO THE CONVOCATION WEEK MEETINGS OF SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES THE American

held at the American Museum of Natural His tory October 16 1911 Chairman Frederic A Lucas presiding The program consisted of a lecture by Dr Charles H Townsend director of the New York Aquarium on The Voyage of the Albatross to the Gulf of California In the spring of 1911 the Albatross under the direction of Dr Townsend made a natural history survey of the Gulf of California Much valuable information was obtained bearing on the ocean ography and the general biology of this region and especially the deepsea forms After stating that the American Museum of Natural History the New York Zoological Society the New York Botanic Museum and the United States National Museum cooperated in the voyage of the Albatross by special arrangement with the U S Bureau of Fisheries Dr Townsend gave a general account of the work done The Albatross sailed from San Diego Twenty six hauls of the dredge were made the deepest being 1760fathoms Shore work was carried on at 32 anchorages around the peninsula of Lower California and at islands in the gulf Important collections of mammals birds reptiles and plants were made A special study was made of the fishery resources of the region An interesting feature of the expedition was the rediscovery of the supposed extinct elephant seal Mirounga About 100 of these animals were found at Guade loupe Island which is uninhabited Six yearlings were sent alive tothe New York Aquarium and three large males and a female were secured for skins and skeletons The males were each 16 feet long Excellent photographs were made Among the interesting forms obtained by dredging were Harriotta and Cyema two deepsea fishes not previously recorded from the Pacific SCIENCE 891

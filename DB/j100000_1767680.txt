sharks in Lake Nicaragua and seems inclined to attribute to fiction the accounts of their presence which have from time to time been given The reading of Mr Amess let ter reminded me of a visit to this lake made by my friend Mr Charles W Richmond of the U S National Museum and of the narrative he gave me on his return of his per sonal experience with the sharks Mr Richmond passed a year in Nicaragua in making natural history collections and spent considerable time on Lake Nicaragua and the two rivers the Erio and San Juan which connect with it on the south his visit occupied parts of the years 1892 and 1893 He has kindly furnished me some interesting notes on the freshwater sharks inhabiting Lake Nicara gua and its tributaries which I venture to present al though a contribution on this subject fromi the erudite Professor Theodore Gill which T understand has been sent to Science may render the present remarks supererogatory There seems little ground at this time for doubting the existence of sharks in this region They are mentioned in the works of Belt Squier and other writers on Nicaragua and Central America they are so well known to the in habitants of the country as to occasion little comment and they have been recorded and described by several ichthyological writers The information gathered by Mr Richmond and his personal observations tend to indicate that the sharks are quite abundant Two wellinformed men whose business was the hunting of wadding birds for their plumes re ported to him that they frequently saw sharks and the captain of one of the lake steamers a resident of that re gion for more than thirty years spoke of sharks as being particularly numerous near Granada where they remain in the vicinity of the steamer when it is moored there At San Carlos two Americans who made frequent fishing excursions on the lake mentioned the occurrence of sharks as not unusual Mr Richmond saw a shark in the Rio Frio many miles from its mouth This river flows into the San Juan just Vol XXII No 555 below the lake on some maps it is incorrectly made to empty into the lake The example in question swam back and forth near the bank of the river and did not take alarm even after several balls had been fired at it from a rifle It was in plain sight and Mr Richmond had an excellent opportunity to estimate its length which ap peared to be about five feet During his voyage down the river in a row boat his companion a Mr Hausen stopped one morning to fish from a snag in midstream The fish bit well and he had some excellent sport Once he attempted to haul in a very desirable fish and had got it partly out of the water when a shark seized it and took both fish and hook The shark came very near to the gentleman and presented its head in uncomfortably close proximity to his foot M5r Hausen had made a number of trips up the Rio Frio and had seen sharks there before Sharks are found in all parts of the San Juan River which drains Lake Nicaragua They are particularly abundant at Castillo Viejo where the telegraph operator of the canal company whiles away his leisure hours in catching them Mr ieihmond saw several at this point doubtless attracted by the flesh of a monkeys skull which he threw into the stream The Machuca rapids below Castillo make it impossible for salt water to reach that place and the sharks seen were presumably the same as those infesting the lake The shark inhabiting the lake apparently does not reach a large size as we are accustomed to judge sharks on our coasts Four or five feet seems to be the average length attained The presence of this representative of a typically marine order of fishes in Lake Nicaragua is not the only interesting feature of the fish fauna of this body of water Mr Richmond refers to another order of saltwater fishes closely related to the sharks which is represented by a large species the sawfish Pristis The plume hunters before mentioned reported seeing individuals about three feet in length and their occurrence was also confirmed by Captain Augustine of the steamer lanagua Systematic investigation of the fauna of this lake will doubtless disclose the existence of other animals appar e Pisos Remedy for Catarrh Is the Best Easiest to TUse and Cheapest l Sold by Drug JUST PUBLISHED 5 0 E T Haz imp 8vo Cloth 430 pp By Kegan Paul Trench Trubner  Co

to prove that at some remote period the present lake bed was simply a part of the sea bottom which was thrown up by volcanic action with the supernatant water and its inhabitants In the Escondido River which enters the sea on the Mosquito Coast Mr Richmond found sharks as far up as De Rama sixtyfive miles from its mouth During the dry season a period of very brief duration the water is brackish at high tide at this distance Several sharks from two to four feet long were caught here while the water was perfectly fresh It is not known however that these were of the same species as

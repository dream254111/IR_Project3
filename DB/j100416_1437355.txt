active and very brightly colored 5 Desmognathus fuscus Several individuals occurred in the same streamlet with the preceding 6 Bufo americanus Abundant in the valley 7 Hyla versicolor was heard frequently in the pine woods about Intervale 8 Rana clamitans was common in pools along the Saco river 9 Rana palustris several specimens seen 10 Rana pipiens was also encountered in the meadows at Intervale In September they and both the preceding frogs were abroad in abundance in the rich meadows feeding on crickets 11 Rana sylvatica was found not only in the meadows near the woods but some distance up on the sides of the mountains Several were taken at an elevation of about 2500 ft on Mt Kearsage in the spruce woods They were generally abundant in the vicinity of the little mountain swamps FRANK G SPECK Phila Pa DISTRIBUTION OF SCELOPORUS IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA When Stejneger in 1918 Proc Biol Soc Wash 31 1918 p 91 described Sceloporus woodi he believed that its distribution was confined to Cen tral and East Central Florida for his specimens came from Polk and Brevard counties It seemed almost inconceivable that so conspicuous a novelty could have remained so long unnoticed did it range widely My surprise therefore was very great last winter to 48COPEIA find that woodi really was abundant at several sta tions far to the south of the zone whence it had been reported Throughout the lower portion of its range down the narrow coastal strip between the Ever glades and the sea woodi is closely confined to the sterile areas of fine white ridge sand where the Spruce Pine Pinus clausa grows These ridges of snowy sand with a ragged vegetation occur at inter vals down the East Coast for instance at about five miles north of West Palm Beach between Boca Ra tone and Pompano below Pompano and about one mile north of Hallandale At this point this environ ment is met with for the last time on ones southward way and not far below this the limestone area begins and but little sand can be found away from the beach es Sceloporus woodi occurs sparingly at all the sta tions I have mentioned and near Hallandale in the last little patch of Spruce Pines a few individuals may be found but none a yard farther to the south ward From New Jersey southward S undulatus oc curs widespread especially in pine or scrub oak woods and Dunn Bull Amer Mus Nat Hist 37 1917 p 627 has noticed that it is found up to about 3000 feet in the mountains of North Carolina In Florida I have often wondered whether perhaps its range was not roughly coterminous with that of Geomys The pocket gopher called for some unknown reason sala mander in Florida occurs in the Black Jack oak ridges and their characteristic mounds of freshly turnedup white sand are conspicuous at various scat tered localities in Eastern Florida as far south as Eau Gallie where there is a large colony right in the town I have never seen a salamander mound south of the Eau Gallie creek but I have heard that there were a few down near Micco or Malabar There is 49COPEIA one Sceloporus undulatus in the Museum marked Eau Gallie Florida T Barbour collection which was a part of the first accumulation of reptiles I ever pos sessed Whether I actually caught it myself I can not remember but I was at Eau Gallie a good deal during my youth It may have been brought or given to me by someone who had been to Florida and I may easily have dropped it into a jar of Eau Gallie mate rial little appreciating until somewhat later in life the value of exact locality data I have received however fresh material from Eureka in Marion County and Orlando in Orange County As yet there are no observations to show whether or not the two species occur anywhere together Certainly un dulatus does not occur at Sebastian St Lucie County where Mr Geo Nelson collected for months this year and took many woodi nor does it occur farther south where the writer was collecting at the same time To find out whether or no undulatus was as closely asso ciated with one plant formation as woodi appears to be I wrote Mr A G Reynolds of Gulfport Florida who answers thus Sceloporus undulatus inhabits the Piney woods Blackjack ridges and the high hammocks  In the Blackjacks about Fruitland Park Lake County where I have collected them they are very plentiful  When on a burnt log they often try to escape capture by running a short distance then squatting suddenly to escape notice Where the land is cleared they are found on fences stumps or the sides of houses but they are rarely seen on the ground I have never seen this lizard in this neighborhood Gulfport near St Petersburg and I do not think it occurs in the southern part of the Pinellas subpeninsula However at Clearwater Southerland and other places in the Piney woods in the northern part of this Pinellas County I am told that it is abundant Mr Reynolds adds that 50they occur only in land which has a good drainage and where no water stands Mr Nicholson writes that about Orlando it occurs only in the high ham mocks or in the oak ridges Thus it would seem that undulatus had a far more varied habitat than woodi The latter also is generally seen on the ground Fur ther notes on the localities where these two species may be found will be awaited with much interest and to delimit accurately their ranges will be a problem very well worth the trouble of solving THOMAS BARBOUR Cambridge Mass AMBYSTOMA OPACUM AT FLORENCE MASS Recently a good deal of information has come to light regarding the breeding habits of Ambystoma opacum in the fall The following concerns the ani mal in the early Spring The locality too is rather far North and inland At the head of Broad Brook a small tributary of the Connecticut just outside of Florence Mass there is a series of swamps and small pools The alti tude is about 200 feet There are many outcrops of the country rock in all directions so that there can be but little depth of soil under the pools In one of these pools on April 7 1917 I found eggs of Ambystoma maculatum and later caught several adults at night in the pool I visited the pool in the Fall of 1917 but found it completely dried up On April 15 1918 I again visited the pool The ice had just gone after the very severe winter but there were a few egg masses of A maculatum in the water and I decided to return that night in the hope of getting some adults COPEIA 51

neurology and psychology it is soime what inaccurate and a trifle naive The au thor seems willing almost anywhere to take up a position on questions that are contro verted and inherently difficult of decision Another criticism is that the deductive tend ency is more implicitly followed by the author than the nature of his material allows Once having reached a perhaps tentative conclu sion on some question he is satisfied to use this conclusion as the basis of farreaching deductions For example this is his evidence in favor of a richer emotional life in warm blooded than in coldblooded animals The warmblooded type developed as a result of the development of the sympathetic nervous sys tem which regulates the vasomotor system in such a fashion as to keep the body at a uni form temperature by sending blood where more warmth is needed and stimulating the action of the sweat glands where the heat needs to be reduced I have not the space to discuss the causes for this development here As we have seen in an earlier chapter the emotions arise out of the activity of the sympathetic system so that the development of that system means the development of the emotional nature of these classes of animals So that the emotions involved in sexual pa rental and wider social relationships now begin to play a wider part  pp 372373 It is but fair to say that the authors treatment is much more satisfactory when the broad trend of the book is considered than when particular pas sages are taken for examination Certainly it is well to bring emphatically before the reading public the notion that a science of hu man behavior is possible and actual as well to a much greater degree than this book indi cates and that this science is distinctly a bio logical science related to the study of animal behavior on one side and on another to the structure and functions of the nervous sys tem R S WOODWORTH COLTUMBIA UNIVERSITY 417 BOTANICAL NOTES FIGHTING THE CHESTNUT BLIGHT ONE of the most interesting contests is now being waged between the trained plant pathol ogists on the one hand and a parasitic fungus on the other and thus far it must be admitted that the outcome of the battle is by no means as assured as we could wish it to be The chestnut tree is found naturally in an area stretching from southern Maine to Georgia and Alabama and extending a greater or less distance east and west of the Appalachian Mountains A few years ago 1904 a dis ease of the bark of this tree appeared near New York City and from this point it has spread northeastward westward and south eastward as far as Massachusetts Vermont Central Pennsylvania Maryland and Virginia It has been made out that the disease is due to a Sphaeriaceus fungus known as Diaporthe parasitica the structure of which has been pretty well investigated So threatening has this disease become that last February a general conference was held in Harrisburg Pennsylvania for the consid eration of ways and means for preventing its further spread the results of which appeared a little later in a thick pamphlet of a little more than two hundred and fifty pages of papers discussions and proposed programs Many halftone reproductions of drawings and photographs add greatly to the value of the publication which must prove to be most use ful to the man who wants to try to save his chestnut trees as well as to the botanist who wishes to keep in touch with this contest between pathological science and a rapidly spreading diseaseproducing fungus As the pamphlet is a state publication it can no doubt be had by application to the governor at Harrisburg Pennsylvania BOTANICAL NOTES A HANDY little flora of central and northern Europe has been compiled by F Hermann and published by Weigel Leipzig under the title of  Flora von Deutschland und Fenno skandinavien sowie von Island und Spitz MARCH 14 1913N S VOL XXXVII No 950 bergen It covers the area bounded west wardly by Belgium and eastern France south erly and easterly by Switzerland Galacia and central Russia to the White Sea Spitzbergen and Iceland It thus includes Germany Bel gium Holland Denmark Norway Sweden more than one half of Russia besides parts of Austria and France and the islands men tioned Yet in spite of the large area in cluded the book contains only 524 small oc tavo pages It should serve as a good model for our North American manuals MIss FREDERICA DETMERS has published her dissertation for the doctorate An Ecological Study of Buckeye Lake as a contribution to the phytogeography of Ohio constituting a pamphlet of 138 pages This artificial lake a little more than seven miles long and from a quarter of a mile to a mile and a half in width was constructed eighty years or more ago on the site of an impassable swamp Some interesting studies were made by Miss Detmers and these are recorded in her paper There is an annotated list of plants collected in and about the lake and a good bibli ography THE New Jersey Forest Park Reservation Commission has issued a useful pamphlet en titled The Planting and Care of Shade Trees  which may interest botanists and cer tainly will do so for those who are interested in trees The second half of the book is de voted to Insects Injurious to Shade Trees by the state entomologist J B Smith and  Diseases of Shade and Forest Trees by the state plant pathologist M T Cook Many good halftone reproductions of photo graphs add much to the value of the report ALLIED to the foregoing is the paper on Cultivation of Native Ornamental Plants by Miss Eloise Butler inthe October Minne sota Horticulturist In it the author enthu siastically urges the use of a large number of wild plants listing them under the following heads Trees Shrubs Woody Vines Herba ceous Vines Shade Plants Early Flowering Herbs chiefly shade plants Flowering Herbs that will grow in Full Sun On reading the paper one is filled with a desire to make a little wild garden in ones back yard HERE we may notice briefly Professor Henry Kraemers Outlines of Courses in Botany Microscopy and Pharmacognosy for phar macy students The  first years work  bot any as here outlined is one of the best we have seen A DOZEN years ago Professor Selby of the Ohio Agricultural Experiment Station pub lished a bulletin No 121 entitled  A Con densed Handbook of Diseases of Cultivated Plants in Ohio which proved to be so useful that a demand sprang up for it all over the country Two years ago he published in pamphlet form a revised and enlarged edition No 214 under practically the same title and now we have a bound book with essentially the same matter as the second edition but with the title  Handbook of Diseases of Cultivated Plants This also is issued by the Experi ment Station and is numbered as before 214 In its present form it is a handy book of somewhat more than one hundred and fifty pages of text and includes one hundred and six text illustrations We may hope that in time this may grow into a still more com plete handbook of plant diseases the need of which is suggested by the demand shown for this bulletin CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OP NEBRASKA THE AGE OF PICANTHROPUS ERECTUS JUST twenty years ago Dubois startled the scientific world by his announcement of the discovery of the skeletal remains of an ape man Pithecanthropus erectus near the hamlet of Trinil in east central Java The age was supposed to be Pliocene and recently Dubois has reiterated his belief in the Pliocene age of this unique material in which he is confirmed by Stremme and others Discussion of the age of these remains has been the basis for a considerable volume of literature and the re cent tendency has been toward considering Pithecanthropus younger rather than older Thus Martin and Elbert assign it to the old 418 SCIENCE

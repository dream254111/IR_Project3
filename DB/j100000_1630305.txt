Albrecht The estraor dinarily small eccentricity 01fl7fl733 together with the major asis log a  0319t0 at once suggests asteroidal orbits In fact so far as size is concerned the orbit is seen to lie be tween the orbits of Mars and Jupiter the comets perihelion distance being slightly greater than the aphelion distance of PlLars It will also be noticed that the eccentricity is less than that of Mercurys orbit and indeed less than the eccentricities of the orbits of many of the minor planets including Eros But the inclination more than 126 with consequent retrograde motion of course sharp ly distinguishes it from any known planetary orbit However disappointing the comet may be in its physical appearance and characteristics it is to be hoped that a number of observa tions may be secured and a study of the orbit made with especial reference to the comets past and futulne relations to Mars and Jupiter when in or near its line of nodes ELLEN HATES WHITIN OBSERVATQRY WELIJESLEY MASS MaY 4 1904 SPECIAIJ ARTI CLER THE WATERSOLUBLE PLANT FOOD OF SOILSX DATA were given showing the amount of phosphoric acid removed by crops particularly wheat at different stages of growth In the case of wheat it was showa that from one square yard of soil 1106 grams of dry matter containing 1018 grams of phosphoric acid were secured Does all of this come from water soluble forms  Reference was made to Hellriegels eihaustive work showing that 359 grams of water are required to produce one gram of dry matter in the form of spring wheat It was found that the quantity of water required to produce 1106 grams of wheat could dissolve only 19 grams of phosphoric acid from the soil upon which the wheat was  Presented at the St Louis  1903  meeting of the Society for the Promotion of Agricultural Seience grown In determining the water soluble phosphoric acid the quantities of soil and water recomraended by Whitney and Cameron in iBulletin NTo 2S Division of Soils TJ S Department of Agriculture were used The soil was left in contact with the water for fifteen days It was shown that if all the water taken frozn the soil was in the form of a saturated soil solution by physical action alone only 19 grams could have been supplied out of a total of 1018 grams in watersoluble forms The conclusion was reached that over 81 per cent of the phosphoric acid of the wheat crop was secured from forms insoluble in water Similar data for oats peas corn and flax showed that the watersoluble phosphoric acid lvas only a minor factor in the food supply of the crops Some of the data in Bulletin No 22 were esamined The experiments by Birner and Lucanus were reviewed and it was shown that all of the data were not given Instead of being a normal oat crop as claimed by Whit ney and Cameron it was shown that Birner and Ijucanus secured from three to six times as much organic matter when more plant food than that secured in the well water was sup plied There were abnormal amounts of plant food particularly nitrates in the well water over sisty parts per million were present This was shown to be more than is found in Ijon don sewage The work of Birner and Lucanus can not be questioned but the application of their results was shown to be inconsistent It was noted on one page 10 that swith the chemical methods then available it was realized that the small amount of plant food contained in a soil estract could not be determined with sufficient accuracy to justify the formation of any definite conclusion and then on a subse quent page the results of Birner and Ijucanus obtained in 18631866 by such methods are cited as the only evidence that plants obtain all of their food from watersoluble forms The action of plant roots upon limestone is accounted for by Whitney and Cameron by the soil water being charged with carbon dioside It has been shown that the same re sult was secured when most seeds were germaSCIENCE 835 MAY 27 1904 nated between litmus papet moistened with distilled water The acid tracings of the roots were distinct and there were no soil solutions charged with carbon dioside present A critical esamination of the data given in Bulletin No 22 shows that the conclusion is not consistent with the figures To ilIustrate On page 32 it is stated that a wheat field yielding 35 bushels per acre contained 249 parts o P04 per million parts of airdry soil The most liberal calculations sliow less than five pounds per acre foot of watersoluble phosphoric acid accepting the data given as correct a wheat crop of 35 bushels would remove 40 pounds at least of phosphoric acid In other words all of the watersoluble phos phoric acid in this soil to a depth of eight feet by pure physical action alone would not supply this crop with food To assume that all the watersoluble plant food can possibly be utilized to a depth of eight feet is even an incorrect assumption because Hellriegels experiments show conclusively that there is a limit to the capacity of crops for absorbing water To assume that a selective process takes place based on physical properties alone and that the plant has the power to take up more watersoluble phosphoric acid than water in which it is dissolved independent of chem ical action or solvent power is not correct Because if such a purely physical action were to take place the ions of lime magnesia otc forced back into the solution by the with drawal of the PO4itons would make the re maining phosphoric acid less soluble In fact purely physical action based upon ionization as claimed by the authors would be working against the plant instead of aiding it in se curing plant food Most of the data given in Bulletin No 22 point to just the opposite conclusions from those drawn It is stated that there are no material differences in the amounts of water soluble plant food present in soils producing the largest and the smallest crop yields The figures in the bulletin conclusively show that on a purely physical basis the rich soils do not contain enough watersoluble plant food to account for all of the mineral matter found in the crop There is only one alternative namely since the figures show that there is not enough watersoluble plant food to ac count for all that there is present in the crop it must be derived from other and insoluble forms In fact no better evidence could be given showing such a conclusion to be logical than the tables in Bulletin No 22 In short the conclusions are entirely at variance with the tables IIARRY SNYDER AGRICULTURAL ESPERIMENT STATION ST ANTHONY PARK MINN TH1S EDISON MEDAL THROUGE the eforts of an organization known as the Edison Medal Association a fund has been created to establish a medal to be known as the  Edison BLedal and the re sponsibility of annually awarding it has been entrusted to the American Institute of Elec trical Engineers The Edison Medal Association was founded by the friends and admirers of the great in ventor and in the language of the deed of gift was organized or the purpose of prop erly recounting and celebrating the achieve ments of a quarter of a century in the art of electric lighting with which the name of Thomas Alva Edison is imperishably identi fied and  for the establishment of an Edison Bledal which should during centuries to come serve as an honorable incentive to the youth of America to maintain by their works the high standard of accomplishment by the illus trious man whose name and features shall live hile human intelligence continues to inhabit the world The gift was formally made and the re sponsibility of conferring it assumed by the institute at its annual dinner given at the WaldorfAstoria Hotel in New York on February tt last held to not only commem orate the event but also to celebrate the fifty seventh anniversary of Mr Edisons birth The fund has been deposited with the Con tinental Trust Coxnpany of New Tork and there will be available this year sufficient funds for a medal which will be awarded by a suitable committee of the institute soon to be appointed

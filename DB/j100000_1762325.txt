of it No relation of time to the lines of magnetic force has as yet been discovered Ibid 3253 Finally on pp 439 and 440 of Experimental Researches vol iii edition of 1855 he gives in detail too long for quota tion here his views of the different phenomena which it seems to me fully support the position I have taken in this matter NELSON W PERRY Cincinnati O Feb 17 Supposed Aboriginal FishWeirs in Naamans Creek near Claymont Del IF the substituted letter of Mr Hilborne T Cresson to the American Antiquarian published in your issue of Feb 14 had ever been printed before certainly I should not have received the impression that Mr Cresson once fancied he had discovered the remains of piledwellings at Naamans Creek on the Delaware The differences between the two versions are very striking to whoever takes the trouble of comparing them I never before understood that Mr Cresson regarded the version of his letter published in the Antiquarian in November 1887 as an atro ciously garbled version of it I supposed he only complained of certain bad mistakes in the proofreading such as the substitu tion of cave for cove etc Mr Cresson s memory has played him false in regard to what he wrote to me when he kindly forwarded to me a selection of the objects discovered at the three  stations On referring to the notes that accom panied the specimens I find that he calls them  pilestructures The fact is that I supposed Mr Cresson had changed his mind in regard to what these structures actually were and as I had formed the opinion upon first reading what he had printed re specting them that they were merely remains of Indian fish weirs I simply made that statement I found nothing in what Professor Putnam had stated in the Reports of the Peabody Museum vol iv p 44 in regard to Mr Cresson s discoveries to give me any different impression Mr Cressons letter to me to which he refers containing the request that I should adopt his corrected views came too late as I wrote to him because my manuscript was already in the printers hands That I should have drawn such inferences about Mr Cressons opinions does not seem to me so inexplicable as it does to him HENRY W HAYNES Boston Feb 16 MR H T CRESSON in his letter published in Science Feb 14 seems to want to get away from his own assertion and so takes the opportunity to abuse the editor of the American An tiquarian If you will allow me to quote the very words which he used in his letter and which were published in the Antiqua rian exactly as they were written without any change whatever your readers will see what his position was in the year 1887 though he seems to have changed his opinion since that time The words are as follows  The results so far seem to indicate that the ends of the piles embedded in the mud judging from the implements and other debris scattered around them once supported shelters of early man that were erected a few feet above the water the upper portions of the piles having disappeared in the long lapse of time that must have ensued since they were placed there  the flats are covered by four and onehalf feet of water on the flood tide on the ebb the marsh is dry and covered with slimy ooze several feet in depth varying in different places Three different dwellings have been located all that exist in the flats referred to after a careful ex amination within the last four years of nearly every inch of ground carefully laid off and examined in sections The implements found in two of the supposed river dwelling sites are very rude in type and generally made of dense argil lite not unlike the palieoliths found by my friend Dr C C Ab bott in the Trenton gravels TCE 151 The character of the implements from the other or third sup posed river dwelling on the Delaware marshes are better finished objects made of argillite indicating a greater antiquity than ordinary surface found Indian relics At this pile dwelling a human tooth has been found and fragments of a jaw bone ends of scapulee etc It is my intention later on to present my speci mens to the Peabody Museum of Ethnology and Archaeology at Cambridge Mass The above is a quotation from the letter published in the American Antiquarian in 1887 Mr Cresson desires the readers of Science to compare the two letters In order that they may do so I quote a part of the letter which appeared in Science Feb 14 see p 116 near the bottom of the page It is as follows The results so far 1877 seem to indicate that the ends of piles embedded in the mud judging from the implements and other debris scattered around them had once served as supports to structures intended for fishweirs these in all probability pro jecting a few feet above the water and were no doubt interlaced with wattles or vines to more readily bar the passage of fish from the creek into the river The upper portion of these wooden structures has entirely disappeared in the long lapse of time that has ensued since they were placed there   At slack water it forms a low mudbank slanting toward the creek Three differ ent stations were located probably all that exist in the bed of the creek referred to This opinion is based upon careful exam inations made within the past four years of nearly every inch of ground in the neighborhood of the wooden stakeends by dredging in sections between certain points marked upon the creeks bank The implements found in one of the stations are generally made of argillite with a few of quartz and quartzite Some were very rude in character and not unlike the palaeoliths found by Dr C C Abbott in the Trenton gravels Objects of stone and pottery rather better in finish than those at station A have been found at the two other stations B and C This is a quotation from Science the sentences being consecu tive The Italics will show the words and clauses which in one letter convey one impression and in the other letter convey an entirely different impression Mr Cresson charges the editor with putting in the words shelters of early man that were erected a few feet above the water three different dwellings two of the supposed river dwelling sites The character of the implements from the other or third supposed river dwelling on the Delaware marshes are better finished objects made of argillite indicating a greater antiquity than ordinary surface found Indian relics At this pile dwelling a human tooth has been found and fragments of a jaw bone ends of scapulae etc Now the editor of the American Antiquarian does not pretend to be ingenious enough to fabricate such sentences and interpolate them into a letter It is beyond the skill of an ordinary man to interpolate remarkst of that kind If these words are not contained in the copy which Mr Cresson says he kept why did not Mr Cresson change the wording or request that it should be corrected in the two years that have elapsed Professor Haynes quoted from the American Antiquarian supposing that Mr Cressons own words were to be relied upon The statement went into The Critical and Nar rative History on the strength of Mr Cressons own words The editor of the Antiquarian at the time said nothing about the find If Mr Cresson wishes to withdraw from the position taken he is at liberty to do so but he should not charge the editor of the Antiquarian with garbling or changing his letter unless he can prove it STEPHEN D PEET Mendon Ill Feb 18 The Fiske RangeFinder I WAS much interested in the description of the Fiske range finder which appeared in Science on Jan 24 There is muchl credit due Lieut Bradley A Fiske for the ingenious manner irn which he has applied a most beautiful electrical combination ta a practical purpose and there is no doubt that its range of use fulness will extend beyond the realms of gunnery practice While reading the article an idea came into my mind whichl may also have occurred to Lieut Fiske and been rejected as ira

of about three million gallons per day An artesian well on the grounds near the river offers a limited flow of hard water which is not stored The grounds comprise sixty acres of cleared and wooded land mostly with a gentle slope and extending from the banks of the river to the top of the bluffs The river frontage is about a quarter of a mile The station has two launches and a num ber of rowboats with one portable Evinrude motor A fishing crew is engaged almost daily Opportunities are therefore offered for col lecting in the various parts of the river or in the lakes and slues which are found in the islands and the lowlands of the Illinois shore Interesting aquatic environments are also pre sented by the ponds on the station grounds which are generally very rich in plankton The laboratory will not only be used by the permanent staff and associates of the bureau engaged on special problems but it is desired to extend the facilities of the institution to other investigators desiring to study problems for which the conditions at Fairport may be particularly favorable The laboratory is furnished with the ordi nary glassware and scientific apparatus No charge will be made for occupancy of tables or dormitory rooms but the mess will be operated upon a cooperative plan each participant sharing in the expense Further conditions and information will be supplied upon request Since only a limited number can be accom modated in the first season it is requested that applicants for tables address the Com missioner of Fisheries Washington D C or the director of the biological station Fairport Iowa as early as practicable Investigators requiring the use of special or unusual appa ratus should communicate particularly with the director in order that they may be in formed as to the special equipment of the station related to their needs ROBERT E COKER Director March 2 1914 A NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF UNIVER SITY PROFESSORS IN the spring of 1913 a circular letter signed by most of the full professors of the Johns Hopkins University was sent to mem bers of the faculties of nine other universities inviting them to consider the advisability of the formation of a national association of uni versity professors and to send delegates to an informal conference for the discussion of the matter The letter contained the follow ing statement of the reasons actuating the signers of it The reasons which seem to demand the forma tion of such an association are fairly evident The university teacher is professionally concerned with two distinct though related interests Both of these interests can be furthered by cooperation and the interchange of views and therefore by organization for only one of them has suitable organization yet been attained As scholar and investigator the teacher is interested in the ad vancement of learning and the diffusion of knowl edge in his specialty and cooperative effort for these ends is already effectively organized through our numerous technical societies and the several sections of the American Association But the university professor is also concerned as a member of the legislative body of his local insti tution with many questions of educational policy which are of more than local significance he is a member of a professional body which is the spe cial custodian of certain ideals and the organ for the performance of certain functions essential to the wellbeing of society and concerning the character efficiency public influence and good re pute of this body he can not be indifferent It is on this side that there is need for more definite and more comprehensive organization The general purposes therefore of the contemplated associa tion would be to promote a more general and methodical discussion of the educational problems of the university to create means for the authori tative expression of the public opinion of the pro fession and to make possible collective action on occasions when such action seems called for A favorable response was received in all cases and statements expressing the belief in the desirability of the formation of such an association were drawn up and signed by members of the faculties of most of the uni 458 SCIENCE

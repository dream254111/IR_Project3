OF MERCURY OUT OF THE MERIDIAN NEAR HIS GREATEST ELONGATION SEPT 1786 MADE BY MR JOHN SMEATON F R S WITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER OF HIS OWN INVENTION AND WORKMANSHIP ACCOMPANIED WITH AN INVESTIGATION OF A METHOD OF ALLOWING FOR REFRACTION IN SUCH KIND OF OBSERVATIONS COM MUNICATED TO THE REV NEVIL MASKELYNE D D F R S AND ASTRONOMER ROYAL AND BY HIM TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY READ JUNE 7 1787 M DE LA LANDE HAVING ANNOUNCED TO SOME OF MY ASTRO NOMICAL FRIENDS THE UTILITY OF ACCURATE OBSERVATIONS OF MERCURY AT HIS TWO ELONGATIONS THE LAST YEAR IN AUGUST AND SEPTEMBER I TRIED TO GET OBSERVATIONS OF THAT PLANET IN CROS SING THE MERIDIAN FOR SOME DAYS BEFORE AND AFTER THE GREATEST ELONGATION IN AUGUST AND THOUGH THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE ABOUT THAT TIME WAS NOT VERY FAVOURABLE TO THE PURPOSE YET THERE WAS ONE DAY THAT I THOUGHT UNEXCEPTIONABLE BUT COULD NOT PERCEIVE THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF MERCURY AT WHICH I WAS THE RATHER SURPRISED AS I HAD FORMERLY SEEN THAT PLANET IN THE LIKE SITUATION WITH THE SAME INSTRUMENT WITH PERFECT PERSPI CUITY AND AS I DID NOT HEAR OF ANY ONE ELSE HAVING SUCCEEDED IN  THE INSTRUMENT MENTIONED IS A TRANSIT MADE BY MYSELF IN THE YEAR 1768 AT WHICH TIME ACHROMATIC OBJECTGLASSES NOT HAVING BEEN SO FAR AS I KNEW APPLIED TO ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS BY OTHERS BUT HAVING FOUND THE GOOD EFFECTS THEREOF FORMR SMEATONS OBSERVATION C 319 IN THIS OBSERVATION I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE VERY POSSIBLE FOR THE SAME DISAPPOINTMENT AGAIN TO HAPPEN WITH RESPECT TO THE APPROACHING ELONGATION IN SEPTEMBER I JUDGED THEREFORE THAT IT MIGHT BE OF SOME UTILITY TO ASTRONOMY IF BY ANY MEANS A GOOD OB SERVATION OF MERCURY COULD BE GOT AND ALSO THAT IT WOULD BE A PROPER SUBJECT WHEREON TO MAKE TRIAL OF AN INSTRUMENT FOR SUCH PURPOSES THE IDEA OF WHICH I HAD CONCEIVED AND BEGUN TO CONSTRUCT ABOVE FORTY YEARS BEFORE BUT WHICH FROM VA RIOUS AVOCATIONS I DID NOT PERFECT TO MY SATISFACTION TILL THE YEAR 1770 SINCE WHICH TIME IT HAS LAIN BY IN HOPES THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN BY WHICH A FULL AND EFFECTUAL TRIAL MIGHT BE MADE THEREOF THIS INSTRUMENT WAS ORGINALLY INTENDED AS AN IMPROVEMENT OF THE COMMON WIRE MICROMETER FOR THE PURPOSES OF TAKING DIFFERENCES OF RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION IN A MORE COM MODIOUS AND EFFECTUAL MANNER THAN COULD BE DONE IN THE ME THOD THEN PRACTISED OF USING THAT INSTRUMENT  AND AT THE SAME FOR OTHER PURPOSES I RESOLVED TO USE A DOUBLE ACHROMATIC OBJECTGLASS MADE BY MR DOLLOND WHICH BEING OF EQUAL APERTURE WITH THE SIMPLE OBJECTGLASS THEN IN THE TRANSIT OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY THIS TELESCOPE I THEREFORE ESTEEMED TO BE OF NEARLY EQUAL VALIDITY AS TO QUANTITY OF LIGHT WITH THAT AT GREENWICH BUT REDUCED TO THE MORE COMMODIOUS LENGTH OF THREE FEET SIX INCHES  SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE THEREWITH AFTER IT WAS COMPLETED I TRANSMITTED TO MY FRIEND MR AUBERT THE CONSISTENCY OF WHICH INDUCED HIM TO PROCURE A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT TO BE MADE FOR COMETARY AND SUCH KIND OF OBSERVATIONS AS CANNOT BE COMMODIOUSLY MADE IN THE MERIDIAN OF THIS INSTRUMENT THE REV MR WOLLASTON HAS MADE HONOURABLE MENTION IN PHIL TRANS VOL LXXV FOR 1785 P 348  THE COMMON WIRE MICROMETER AS USED BY DR BRADLEY AND DESCRIBED FROM A PAPER OF THE DOCTORS HANDWRITING IS GIVEN BY DR MASKELYNE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL LXII FOR THE YEAR 1772 AND IN ADDITION TO TO WHICH I MUST BEG LEAVE TO OBSERVE THAT THE TELESCOPES THEN IN USE FOR THE VOL LXXVII A A A MICRO320 MR SMEATONS OBSERVATION OF MERCURY SAME TIME MORE EFFECTUALLY TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE OF GRAHAMS ASTRONOMICAL SECTOR WHICH WAS CONTRIVED BY HIM AS DR SMITH INFORMS US TO SUPPLY THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE MICROMETER THEN IN USE THE MOST NECESSARY AND FUNDAMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS SEEMED TO BE FIRST THAT OF RENDERING THE MICROMETER TELESCOPE MA NAGEABLE UPON AN EQUATORIAL MOTION AND SECONDLY THE CON TRIVANCE OF A STAND OF SUCH SOLIDITY AND STEDFASTNESS THAT THE TELESCOPE MIGHT PRESERVE THE POSITION IN WHICH IT WAS PLACED FOR A LENGTH OF TIME FOR IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT IF THE TELESCOPE COULD BE MAINTAINED AT REST OR IN A DEGREE OF STABILITY SUPE RIOR TO THAT OF THE ASTRONOMICAL SECTOR THEN THE NECESSITY OF TAKING IN A GREATER COMPASS IN DECLINATION THAN COULD BE COM MODIOUSLY GIVEN TO THE FIELD OF A TELESCOPE WOULD BE THE LESS NECESSARY FOR INSTEAD OF CONFINING THE OBJECT TO A COMPARISON WITH A STAR NOT DIFFERING MORE THAN A FEW MINUTES OF TIME OR AT MOST A QUARTER OF AN HOUR IN RIGHT ASCENSION THOSE COMPA RISONS COULD BE EXTENDED TO AN HOUR OR TWO OR EVEN ON OCCASION TO THREE OR FOUR HOURS THERE BEING SCARCELY ANY PART OF THE HEAVENS SO DEVOID OF STARS OF A SUITABLE MAGNITUDE FOR THESE OBSERVATIONS BUT THAT A PROPER ONE MAY BE FOUND WITHIN THAT COMPASS IN RIGHT ASCENSION PROVIDED THERE IS ALLOWED MICROMETER WERE FROM TEN TO FIFTEEN FEET LONG MADE WITH WOODEN TUBES SUP PORTED AT EACH END UPON TWO WOODEN SUPPORTS BY WHICH THE TELESCOPE COULD BE MANAGED IN ALTITUDE AND AZIMUTH BUT NOT TO FOLLOW A CELESTIAL OBJECT IN ITS PROPER MOTION ON ONE CENTER WHICH APPARATUS I BELIEVE IS STILL REMAINING IN THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY  THIS INSTRUMENT IS DESCRIBED IN SMITHS OPTICS VOL II P 350 AND THE ORIGINAL ONE MADE BY MR GRAHAM WAS AT HIS DEATH PLACED IN THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AND IS MOUNTED UPON A THREELEGGED STAND OF WOOD 1 THEWITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER 321 THE DIFFERENCE OF A DEGREE EITHER NORTH OR SOUTH OF THE OBJECT IN DECLINATION CONSIDERING HOWEVER THAT THE APPROACHING ELONGATION WOULD BE IN THE MORNING AND THAT THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING MERCURY WITH THIS INSTRUMENT WOULD BE SOME TIME IN THE TWILIGHT BETWEEN MERCURYS RISING AND THE RISING OF THE SUN YET ON SUPPOSITION OF CATCHING THE PLANET IN HIS PASSAGE OVER THE WIRES THERE WOULD BE NO CHANCE OF SEEING ANY STAR PASS OVER THE FIELD WHEREWITH TO COMPARE HIM TILL THE FOLLOW ING EVENING WHICH BEING AT LEAST FOURTEEN HOURS THE CERTAIN POSITION OF THE TELESCOPE FOR SO GREAT A LENGTH OF TIME WAS ALMOST MORE THAN I COULD REASONABLY HOPE FOR TO JUDGE HOW FAR I MIGHT FORM AN EXPECTATION BY WAY OF A PREVIOUS TRIAL I COMPARED SATURN WITH  CAPRICORNI  AND FOUND THE RETURN  THE FIELD OF THE TELESCOPE OF MR AUBERTS INSTRUMENT IS TWO DEGREES BUT THAT OF THE ORIGINAL WHEREWITH THIS OBSERVATION WAS MADE IS 1 17 TO GAIN WHICH THE EYEGLASS BEING IMMOVEABLE AND ACHROMATIC TO PREVENT THE INDISTINCTNESS THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TAKEN PLACE NEAR THE BORDER THE MAGNI FYING POWER WAS OBLIGED TO BE CONSIDERABLY REDUCED IN RESPECT OF WHAT HAS BEEN USUAL FOR MICROMETERS THAT IS SO AS NOT TO EXCEED 20 TIMES IN CONSEQUENCE THERE IS THEREFORE NO NEED FOR SO LONG A TELESCOPE THIS BEING BUT 34 23 INCHES FOCAL LENGTH OF OBJECTGLASS BUT BEING A DOUBLE ACHROMATIC MADE BY THE LATE MR JOHN DOLLOND IT IS CAPABLE OF AS GREAT AN APERTURE AS COULD BE GIVEN TO THE SIMPLE OBJECTGLASSES OF TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FEET TELESCOPES THAT WERE THEN GENERALLY GIVEN TO MICROMETERS BUT THE PENCIL OF LIGHT BEING GREATEST IN THIS IS ATTENDED WITH THIS ADVANTAGE THAT THE SMALL STARS CAN BE SEEN VERY DISTINCT AND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE LIKE THE MODERN NIGHTGLASSES AND THERE IS IN REALITY NO NEED OF GREAT MAGNIFYING POWERS FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE FOR THE PLACE OF THE WIRE BEING VIEWED BY AN EYEGLASS OF ABOUT 1 34 INCHES FOCUS ITS PLACE MAY BE DISTINGUISHED TO LESS THAN A 2300TH PART OF AN INCH WHICH ON THE RADIUS OF 34 23 INCHES IS SCARCE 212 OF A DEGREE AND WHICH AS I APPREHEND IS NEARER THE TRUTH THAN CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED FROM INSTRUMENTS OUT OF THE MERIDIAN  ACCORDING TO THIS OBSERVATION  PRECEDED   THE 2D OF SEPT AT 9 H 15 PM MEAN TIME BY 30 97 MT AND WITH GREATER DECLINATION SOUTH THAN  BY 41 23 A A A 2 OF322 MR SMEATONS OBSERVATION OF MERCURY OF THE STAR TO THE SAME PLACE TWO EVENINGS AFTERWARDS BOTH IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND DECLINATION WAS SO NEAR THAT I CONCLUDED I MIGHT VERY WELL EXPECT A GOOD OBSERVATION OF MERCURY IN CASE I COULD GET A SIGHT OF HIM THOUGH THE STARS WHEREWITH HE WAS TO BE COMPARED LAY AT THE DISTANCE OF THE FOLLOWING EVENING AT THE SOONEST THE MICROMETER IS FURNISHED WITH FIVE HORARY WIRES DENO MINATED IN THEIR ORDER A A B C D B BEING THE MID DLE HORARY WIRE AND THE TWO DECLINATION WIRES ARE DENO MINATED A AND B EACH MOVEABLE BY A SEPARATE AND INDEPENDENT MICROMETERSCREW FROM THE OUTSIDE OF THE FIELD TO THE CENTER AND A LITTLE BEYOND IT SO THAT EACH WIRE CAN BE MOVED INTO THE PLACE OF THE OTHER WHEN AT OR NEAR THE CENTER THE MORNING OF THE 23D OF SEPTEMBER ABOUT A QUARTER PAST FIVE OCLOCK THE AIR BEING CLEAR AND PERFECTLY SERENE IT BEING THEN ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER MERCURYS RISING AND NEAR THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN I VERY READILY FOUND MERCURY WITH THE TELESCOPE AND WHEN FOUND COULD EASILY SEE HIM WITH AN OPERA GLASS AND MERCURY BEING THEN IN A STATE OF VERY LITTLE ALTERATION OF DECLINATION I ADJUSTED ONE OF THE DECLINATION WIRES TO HIS APPARENT RUN BY MAKING HIM TRAVERSE THE WHOLE FIELD THE OBSERVATIONS WERE THEN TAKEN AS  IN DR BRADLEYS PAPER IT IS SAID THAT BEFORE THE LATE ALTERATIONS BOTH THE DECLINATION WIRES WERE MADE MOVEABLE AND THAT IT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT TO MAKE ONE OF THEM FIXED AND ONE ONLY MOVEABLE BUT HOWEVER THEY MIGHT BE IMME DIATELY PRECEDING THE DOCTORS TIME I BELIEVE THE ORIGINAL MICROMETERS BY MR TOWNLEY WERE WITH ONE FIXED AND ONE MOVEABLE DECLINATION WIRE AS I HAVE SEEN ONE IN THIS FORM AMONG THE REMAINING APPARATUS OF MR ABRAHAM SHARPE IN AN INSTRUMENT HOWEVER FITTED UP FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE EQUATORIAL MICRO METER I BELIEVE IT WILL BE FOUND MOST CONVENIENT TO HAVE BOTH THOSE WIRES MOVEABLE AS BY THIS MEANS THEY NOT ONLY ARE ENABLED TO SLIDE INTO EACH OTHERS PLACE BUT EVERY PART OF THE FRAME OF THE INSTRUMENT REMAINS FIXED DURING THE WHOLE OF THE OBSERVATION THE TWO SLIDES CARRYING THESE TWO WIRES EXCEPTED INWITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER 32 IN THE FIRST TABLE AND IN THE EVENING I WAS LUCKY ENOUGH T GET THOSE OF  CETI AND O TAURI INTENDING TO REPEAT THE WHOL THE NEXT MORNING AND EVENING THE NEXT MORNING PROVE CLOUDY AND SO CONTINUED THAT I SAW THE PLANET NO MORE BUT IN THE EVENING OF THE 26TH I FOUND THE STARS COME AGAIN SO NEAR THE SAME DECLINATION THAT I WAS ENCOURAGED TO CONTINU THE OBSERVATION TO SEE WHAT CHANGE WOULD HAPPEN IT THE CAME ON BAD RAINY WEATHER TILL THE 30TH WHEN I AGAIN RE PEATED THE OBSERVATION AND FOUND THE STARS TO COME SO NEAR I DECLINATION THAT I WAS FULLY SATISFIED OF THE STABILITY OF TH INSTRUMENT SO FAR AT LEAST AS COULD REGARD TWENTYFOUR HOURS BUT AS I WAS THEN APPOINTED TO GO A JOURNEY AND COUL HAVE NO OTHER USE FOR IT I LOCKED THE DOOR OF THE OB SERVATORY LEAVING THE INSTRUMENT IN ITS POSITION THAT MIGHT SEE WHAT CHANGE WOULD HAPPEN BY THE TIME OF MY RETURN AND WAS QUITE ASTONISHED TO FIND ON THE 13TH OF OCTOBER THAT I HAD REMAINED IN A MANNER UNMOVED FOR IT HAD SUFFERED N MORE APPARENT ALTERATION THAN WHAT MIGHT OCCUR BY THE ERROR OF OBSERVING AND ALTERATIONS OF THE CLOCKS AND TRANSIT IT MUST HOWEVER BE REMARKED THAT BESIDES THAT IN TH CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENT EVERY THING WAS CONTRIVE THAT APPEARED LIKELY TO GIVE IT FIRMNESS IT WAS RESTED UPON THE FRUSTUM OF AN HEXAGONAL PYRAMID OF STONE IN THE FOUNDING WHEREOF GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN AS TO ITS SOLIDITY AND WAS DE TACHED FROM THE

BEING AFFECTED BY REFRACTION AND IN THIS RESPECT IT WILL APPEAR THAT IF IT BE SUPPOSED THERE IS NO DIFFERENCE IN THE QUANTITY OF REFRACTION OF SUCH OBJECTS AS APPEAR WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THIS INSTRUMENT WHICH IS 1 17 THEN THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS TO EACH OTHER WILL NOT BE AFFECTED THEREBY FOR IF IN FIG 1 TAB XIII WE SUPPOSE THE CIRCLE VHRO TO REPRESENT THE BOUNDARY OF THE

THAT THE TWO STARS ARE BOTH SITUATED IN THE SAME HORARY CIRCLE IF AT THE POINT  REFRACTION TAKES PLACE AND BY HYPOTHESIS THIS IS LIFTED UP EQUALLY WITH THE OTHER IN THE PERPENDICULAR L THEN THE LINE   BEING DRAWN THROUGH THE PLACES OF THE TWO STARS WILL BE COTEMPORARY AND PARALLEL TO LX AND THE FIGURE L L BEING EVIDENTLY A RHOMBOIDES THE TWO STARS SO ALTERED BY  THIS WILL READILY BE DEDUCED BY INSPECTION OF THE CELESTIAL GLOBE REFRACTIONWITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER 335 REFRACTION WILL ARRIVE TOGETHER AT THE HORARY CIRCLE LX AT THE SAME TIME AND WITH THE SAME DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION AS IF NO REFRACTION HAD TAKEN PLACE IT IS THEREFORE ONLY THE DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION WHICH TAKES PLACE IN OBJECTS AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS IN THE SAME FIELD THAT CAN ALTER THEIR RELATIVE SITUATIONS HOW EVER IT APPEARS NECESSARY TO EXAMINE WHAT THIS MAY AMOUNT TO LET THE LETTERS IN FIG 2 DENOTE THE SAME THINGS AS BEFORE TO WHICH WE WILL ADD THAT A A B C D DENOTE THE PARALLEL HORARY WIRES OF THE MICROMETER

THE HORIZONTAL LINE AT D TO THE VERTICAL LINE AT B IN THIS IT WILL PASS THROUGH A DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION ACCORDING AS IT GETS MORE AND MORE ELEVATED ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL LINE HO AND LET THE ELEVATION LB BE HALF A DEGREE OR 30 MINUTES THEN ACCORDING TO DR BRADLEYS TABLE OF REFRACTION  THE DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION BETWIXT THE 78TH AND 79TH DEGREES OF ZENITH DISTANCE IS 236 HALF OF WHICH

ABOVE CORRECTIONS TAKE PLACE ON SUPPOSITION THAT THE SEVERAL WIRES OF THE MICROMETER WERE STRICTLY PARALLEL TO THE RESPECTIVE PARTS OF THE CIRCLES OF DECLINATION AND HORARY CIRCLES IN THE HEAVENS BUT IN THE PRACTICAL USE OF THIS INSTRUMENT IT ISWITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER 337 IS FOUND MORE CONVENIENT ON ACCOUNT OF A READY AND CERTAIN ADJUSTMENT TO PLACE ONE OF THE WIRES AA OR BB PARALLEL TO THE APPARENT TRACK OF THE STAR WHEREWITH THE PLANETARY BODY IS TO BE COMPARED IN CONSEQUENCE WHEN THE STAR  FIG 1 IS LIFTED UP TO L IT WILL NOT STRICTLY PURSUE THE LINE LP BUT BEING LESS AND LESS LIFTED UP AS IT MOUNTS HIGHER IT WILL APPA RENTLY FALL MORE AND MORE BELOW THE LINE LP AS IT ASCENDS ABOVE THE LINE HO AND WILL THEREFORE TAKE A COURSE SUPPOSE LP THE WIRE PLP BEING THEREFORE ADJUSTED TO AGREE WITH PLP BY CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENT THE WIRE BLX WILL ASSUME THE POSITION QLX PERPENDICULAR TO PLP THE STAR THEREFORE THAT RAN ALONG THE PARALLEL E BEFORE IT SUFFERED REFRACTION AND AT

THE SUPPOSITION OF THE SIDES OF THE TRIANGLES LYZ AND LYL BEING THE SAME CANNOT BE STRICTLY SO NOR CAN THEY HAVE THE SAME PROPORTIONS NOR ARE ANY OF THE LINES CONCERNED RIGHT LINES THAT ARE SUPPOSED

AS THE CORRECTION BEFORE STATED OF 203 IS AN ANGULAR ERROR TAKING PLACE IN PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OR THE DECLINATION FOR THE DECLINATION GIVEN OF 24 SAY AS 382 24 203 13 TO WHICH ADDING 44 WE SHALL HAVE 174 FOR THE WHOLE ERROR IN RIGHT ASCENSION SUPPOSING IT IN THE EQUATOR BUT MUST BE AGAIN INCREASED IN THE PROPORTION IN WHICH A STAR HAVING DECLI NATION IS SLOWER THAN A STAR IN THE EQUATOR THAT IS IT MUST BE INCREASED IN THE PROPORTION OF ANY OF THE NUMBERS IN THE FOURTH COLUMN OF TAB II TO THE SIMILAR ONES IN COL 6 OF THE SAME TABLE THAT IS AS 1 46 1 47 OR AS 106 107  174 176  AS ALL THESE ERRORS ARISING FROM DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION ARE IN PROPORTION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT FROM THE CENTER OF THE TELESCOPE THEY WILL TAKE PLACE IN PROPORTION TO THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION OF THE TWO OBJECTS TO BE COMPARED WHETHER THEY HAVE PASSED THE FIELD ON THE SAME OR ON DIFFERENT SIDES OF THE CENTER NOW THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION OF MERCURY AND  ORIONIS BEING ONLY

THAT IN STRICTNESS EACH STAR OUGHT TO HAVE ITS OWN PROPER REDUCTION ON ACCOUNT OF DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION WHICH IN EXTREME CASES WILL AMOUNT TO A SENSIBLE QUANTITY 3 SAYWITH AN EQUATORIAL MICROMETER 339 SAY AGAIN AS 24 23 62 6 THE CORRECTION IN DE CLINATION FROM THE NEAR EQUALITY OF THE LINES LL AND LZ IT IS EVIDENT THAT NO CORRECTION OF DECLINATION IS NECESSARY ON AC COUNT OF THE INCLINATION OF THE WIRES THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE FALLING IN RIGHT ASCENSION AS THEREFORE MERCURY PASSED WITH 23 2 MORE NORTH DECLINATION THAN  ORIONIS AND PASSED THROUGH A PART OF THE MEDIUM THAT LIFTED HIM UP LESS IT THEREFORE GAVE HIM LESS NORTH DECLINATION THAN IT DID TO  AND THEREFORE APPA RENTLY DIMINISHED THE REAL DIFFERENCE HENCE 6 MUST BE ADDED TO THE APPARENT DIFFERENCE 23 2 MAKING IT 23 8 DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION AND AS MERCURY WAS LIFTED UP LESS THAN  HE WOULD NOT SO SOON COME TO THE MIDDLE WIRE BY 11 AS HE SHOULD HAVE DONE HE THEREFORE CAME TOO LATE BY 11 WHICH MUST BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE TIME OF MERCURYS PASSAGE THE 2D OF SEPT WHICH WILL INCREASE THE TIME IN WHICH HE PRECEDED  ORIONIS THAT IS 18 H 43 424 INCREASED BY 11 WILL BE COME 18 H 43 435 DIFFERENCE OF RIGHT ASCENSION I HAVE BEEN THE MORE PARTICULAR IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THIS OBSERVATION FIRST OF ALL TO ASCERTAIN THE DEGREE OF DEPENDANCE THAT MAY BE FORMED ON AN INSTRUMENT OF THE KIND AND SE CONDLY TO INFER SUCH EASY AND SIMPLE RULES THAT OTHER SIMILAR OBSERVATIONS MAY BE THE MORE EASILY REDUCED BEING THEREFORE SATISFIED OF THE STABILITY OF THE INSTRUMENT IF WE HAD CONCLUDED THE OBSERVATION WITH THAT OF MERCURY IN THE MORNING AND OF O TAURI IN THE EVENING OF THE 23D THEN THE RESULT FROM TAB III SHOULD HAVE BEEN H   MERCURY PASSED THE WIRES AT    17 22 349 AND O TAURI PASSED AT    9 36 273 DIFFERENCE OF RIGHT ASCENSION    15 13 524 WHICH340 MR SMEATONS OBSERVATION OF MERCURY WHICH IS THE VERY SAME AS WAS BEFORE DEDUCED FROM THE MEAN OF THE WHOLE   AND IF TO MERCURYS DECLINATION SOUTH OF TELESCOPES CENTER

PRECEDED O TAURI IN RIGHT ASCENSION 15 H 13 524 MEAN TIME AND PASSED THE WIRE WITH MORE SOUTH DECLINATION THAN O TAURI BY 31 34 AFTER THIS O TAURI WOULD HAVE REQUIRED TO BE COMPARED WITH SOME WELL RECTIFIED STAR BY MERIDIAN INSTRUMENTS BUT IN THE PRESENT CASE  ORIONIS ONE OF DR MASKELYNES CATALOGUE OF 34 PRINCIPAL STARS HAPPENED TO LIE SUFFICIENTLY NEAR THE SAME PA RALLEL OF DECLINATION TO ADMIT OF O TAURI TO BE COMPARED THEREWITH BY THE SAME INSTRUMENT WHILE POINTED TO THE SAME PLACE OF THE HEAVENS THE OPERATIONS WHICH WERE SUBSEQUENT THEREFORE MUST BE CONSIDERED AS INTENDED TO SAVE THOSE OF A MERIDIAN INSTRUMENT NOW HAD OUR OBSERVATION CONCLUDED WITH THE ABOVE THEN THE CORRECTION WOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE UPON THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION OF O TAURI WITH MERCURY INSTEAD OF THE ULTIMATE ONE WITH  ORIONIS BUT IT MUST BE OBSERVED THAT WHATEVER QUANTITY OF CORRECTION THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION WOULD OCCA SION IT WOULD BE COMPENSATED IN THE DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION OF OF O TAURI AND  ORIONIS WHEN THEY CAME TO BE OBSERVED ON THE MERIDIAN HOWEVER IN THE PRESENT CASE IT HAPPENS TO BE MORE COMMODIOUS AS BOTH CAN BE DONE UNDER ONE PREPARATORY THEN TO THE LAYING DOWN THE

EF IN TRIPLICATE PROPORTION OF LB TO LC AND THAT LC WILL BE TO EF IN DUPLICATE PROPORTION OF LB LC THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION THEREFORE DUE TO 30 DIFFERENCE OF ELEVATION WILL BE AS LB TO LC SIMPLY BUT THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION IN DECLINATION WILL BE LESS THAN THE DIFFERENCE OF DECLINATION IN THE PROPORTION OF LB2 LC2 AND THAT THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION IN RIGHT ASCENSION WILL BE LESS THAN THE DIFFERENCE OF REFRACTION IN DECLINATION IN THE PROPORTION OF LB CB SIMPLY NOW IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT THE ELEVATION OF THE TELE SCOPES CENTER ABOVE THE HORIZON AND THE HORARY ANGLE VLP WILL ALWAYS BE READILY GIVEN NEAR ENOUGH FOR THE PURPOSE BY THE GLOBE A TRIANGLE GIVEN LBD CAN THEREFORE BE CONSTRUCTED AND THE SIDE LB BEING MADE 30 OR ANY CONVENIENT ALIQUOT

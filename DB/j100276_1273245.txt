defendant to have been insane at the time of making the statements such insanity would be an absolute defense This charge was refused verdict given for the plaintiff and defendant appealed Held the instructions asked should have been given Irvine v Gibson 1904  Ky  77 S W Rep 1106 That the court in giving this decision was not entirely free from sym pathy may be inferred from this statement If God does not hold account able for their misdeeds those whom he suffers to be thus afflicted shall his creatures entrusted with the enforcement of human laws refuse to excuse their ostensible evil doing Surely not While the general rule that a per son non compos mentis is liable for his torts is well established a few early cases and several textwriters have considered slander to be an exception COOLEY ON TonTS 103 TOWNSHEND ON SLANDER AND LIBEL 3rd ed 476 The English rule is that insanity is no defense ODGERS ON LIBEL AND SLANDER 354 In the fcllowing cases usually cited to support the doctrine of the principal case it will be found that insanity was allowed to mitigate the damages and not as an absolute defense Dickinson v Barber9 Mass 225 Yeates v Reed 4 Blackf Ind 463 McDougal v Coward 95 N C 368 The weight to be given to the case of Bryant v Jackson 6 Hump Tenn 199 may be judged from the following extract from the opinion That insanity is a good defense to this action slander as well as all others is not controverted In Horner v Marshall 5 Munf Va 466 an injunction was granted restraining proceedings on a judgment obtained in a slander case because of defendants insanity at the time of the publication The theory upon which the decision in the principal case was based is that an insane person is incapable of forming a malicious intent This view is supported by COOLEY ON TORTS 103 and by the case of Gates v Meredith 7 Ind 440 However since the presumption of malice arising from the publication of slanderous words by a person compos mentis cannot be rebutted except upon a plea of privilege NEWELL ON SLANDER AND LIBEL 316 ODGERS ON LIBEL AND SLANDER 264 the logic of this holding is not apparent See on general topic of liability of an insane person for torts 26 L RA 153 note WILLSCONSTRUCTIONCounsel on both sides requested the court to construe the meaning of the word between in the following clause to be divided equally between the said survivor and our children Appellee claimed that the word between referred to a division into two parts thus giving the survivor half and the children as a class half Held that between should be construed to mean the same as among and that the property should be apportioned equally among the children and the survivor Edwards vKelly 1903Miss35 So Rep418 This construction is undoubtedly more in accordance with the intentions of the testator than one founded upon an etymological difference in the meaning of the words between and among It is in accordance with what seems to be the weight of authority and the unquestionable trend of decisions ROOD ON WILLS H 486489 and notes Johnson v Knight 117 N C 122 23 S E Rep 92 In re Morrisons Estate 138 Cal 401 71Pac Rep 453 Kling v Schnellbecker 107 Ia 636 78 N W Rep 673 WILLSUNDUE INFLUENCETestator made a will disinheriting two of his sons which was the result of undue influence exercised by the testators 644RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS wife and thereafter he made another will containing practically the same provisions as to the disinherited sons Held that such undue influence was available to defeat the second will though exercised at a period remote from the date of its execution and statements of the testator in regard to undue influence were admitted Powers Exr v Powers 1904Ky78 SW Rep 152 Without citing a single supporting decision this case runs counter to the gen eral rule that the undue influence must be a present constraint operating at the time of executing the will Foster v Dickerson 64 Vt 233 265 In re Kauf man

before the undue influence must be considered fatal because it left so deep an impression upon the testators mind If it did make such a deep impression on his mind that convictions which had formerly been anothers became his own then the will was his and not anothers and there was no undue influ ence For cases supporting the proposition that where at the time the tes tator made his will it was a correct expression of his desires the influence exerted at some other time should be disregarded see the note to In re Hesss Will 31 Am St Rep 675 Another questionable holding was that admitting in evidence statements made by the testator that he had been influ enced and that he had made the will and disinherited his sons in order to keep down hell at home The judge cited in support of this ruling the case of Wall v Dimmitt Ky 72 S W Rep 300 which on the point in controversy holds directly the other way and is in harmony with the general rule that the declarations of a testator while competent to show the condition of his mind are incompetent to prove undue influence Middleditch v Wil liams 47 N J Eq 585 4 L R A 738 Appeal of Vivian 74 Conn 257 50 At Rep 797 Earp v Edgington 107

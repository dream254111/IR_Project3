j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1097823,Williams v Commonwealth Decided at Staunton September 24 1896,i245830,616 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec shown by parol to be a mere security for a debt If the assignment is made in good faith to secure an existing debt and future advances the mere fact that the assignor is allowed to check on the assignee which is a bank for the surplus after paying the amount for which the assignment was made will not vitiate the as signment Taking an absolute assignment as a security for a debt is a mere badge of fraud which may be repelled by evidence showing the bona fides of the transac tion For distinction between fraud in law and fraud in fact see opinion 2 AssIGNMENTSInconsistent reservations If an insolvent debtor makes an assignment of all of his property for the benefit of his creditors reserving benefits to himself at the expense of his creditors the assignment will be set aside as fraudulent and void but this rule has no application to an assignment by a debtor of a part only of his estate made in good faith for the purpose of raising money or securing existing creditors reserving the surplus to himself The law would imply such reservation 3 ATTACHrMIENTSNonresidents One who has dwelt in the State for a year or more and is still dwelling here with no intention of leaving is engaged in constructing public improvements in a

STEELE AND OTHERSDecided at Staunton September 17 1896Buchanan J 1 TRUSTS AND TRUSTEESLoss of fundsNegligence The trustee was directed by the court in a pending suit to lend the trust fund and take as security therefor a deed of trust or mortgage on real estate He loaned the money as directed but took as security therefor a confession of judgment upon which execution issued but by the direction of the trustee the execution was not placed in the hands of the proper officer to be levied whereby the limitation on the judgment was re duced to ten years The investment by the trustee was reported to the court and confirmed and three years after making the investment the trustee was removed and the general receiver of the court substituted in his stead The debt was amply secured but was lost solely by permitting the judgment to become barred by the statute of limitations HIeld The trustee is not liable for the loss but the general receiver is It was the duty of the general receiver to ascertain when the judgment would become barred and to provide against that contingency and there is nothing in the facts of this case to exempt him from the performance of that duty WILLIAMS v COMMONWEALTHDecided at Staunton September 24 1896 Keith P 1 CRIMINAL PROCEDUREPresence of prisonerPresumption If the record shows that a prisoner was present in court when a motion for a new trial was made the presumption is that he remained until the court adjourned for the day unless the contrary is made to appear either directly or by necesmary implication When1896 DIGEST OF OTHER RECENT

TRIALMisconduct of juryStatements to jury out of courtObjections after verdict A motion for a new trial on the ground of the misconduct of the jury will not be granted where it appears that the misconduct consisted in hearing a statement of a witness out of court in the presence of the accused but without objection on his part and that after the jury returned into court the matter was called to the attention of the court in the presence of the accused and his coun sel and an opportunity afforded them of crossexamining the witness of which they refused to avail themselves and no objection was made or exception taken till after the jury had rendered their verdict and then for the first time on a mo tion for a new trial COCHRAN V THE LONDON ASSURANCE CORPORATIONDecided at Staunton September 24 1896Cardwell J 1 FIRE INSURANCECase at barExtension of time for suitInferencesDe murrer to evidenceMotion to set aside verdict The evidence of the plaintiff in this case which is all that can be considered on a demurrer to the evidence shows that the insurance company granted the plaintiff an extension of three months after the time his right to sue would be barred by the terms of the policy within which to institute an action that the plaintiff accepted the benefit of the extension and relied on it and that the action was brought within the extended period Though there was evidence upon which the jury might have inferred that the benefit of the extension was not accepted yet upon a demurrer to the evidence or a motion to set aside the verdict of the jury the court is bound to that interpretation of the facts and that conclusion from the evidence which the jury have sanctioned by their verdict 2 FIRE INSURANcEExtension of time for suitSubsequent revocation or qualifi cation After an insurance company has granted an extension of time within which an action may be instituted on one of its policies it cannot withdraw it nor attach conditions to it without the consent of the party to whom the extension is granted PRISON ASSOCIATION OF VIRGINIA V ASHBYDecided at Staunton October 5 1896Buchanan J 1 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWTitle of ActPrison AssociationHabeas corpus The Act of the General Assembly approved February 27 1896 entitled An Act in relation to commitments of minors to Prison Association of Virginia and their custody Acts 18956 p 521 is not in conflict with Art V sec 15 of the Constitution of Virginia but is a valid and constitutional law Sec 3 of the Act which gives the Circuit Court of the city of Richmond exclusive jurisdiction of all habeas corpus and other proceedings to test the right of the Association to retain custody of minors committed surrendered or received into its custody is not broader than the title of the Act nor is it such an abridgement of the right to sue out the writ of habeas corpus as to render that section of the Act unconstitutional 617

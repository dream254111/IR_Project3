J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076858,SOME NEW MODIFICATIONS OF OLD EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSICS,I244632,SOME NEW MODIFICATIONS OF OLD EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSICS1 E S BISHOP THE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO I HOW TO OBTAIN THE BEST RESULTS FROM A TUNING FORK WHICH VIBRATES SYMPATHETICALLY WITH ANOTHER THE TUNING FORKS ARE FIRST BROUGHT INTO UNISON BY SLIDING A PIECE OF SOFT RUBBER TUBING ABOUT HALF AN INCH LONG UP OR DOWN ONE PRONG OF ONE OF THE FORKS THE OPEN ENDS OF THE RESO NATORS ARE THEN PLACED A SHORT DISTANCE APART AND EACH RESONATOR IS PLACED UPON TWO PIECES OF NEW SOFT RUBBER TUBING IF THE EXPERIMENT IS TRIED FIRST WITHOUT THE SOFT RUBBER TUBING SUPPORTS AND THEN WITH THEM THE INTENSITY OF THE EFFECT IS EASILY SEEN TO BE SEVERAL TIMES AS GREAT IN THE LATTER CASE BY THIS METHOD THE AUTHOR MADE AUDIBLE OVER A LARGE ROOM A TUNING FORK OF THE CHEAPEST GRADE USED IN THE LABORATORY FOR THOSE WHOSE HEAR ING IS SOMEWHAT IMPAIRED VIBRATIONS OF THE SECOND FORK MAY BE MADE VISIBLE BY SUSPENDING AN ELASTIC BALL ABOUT A QUARTER OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER WITH A THREAD FOUR OR FIVE INCHES LONG SO THAT IT JUST TOUCHES THE PRONG OF THE SECOND FORK THE FORK IN THIS CASE MADE THE PENDULUM IN CONTACT WITH IT VIBRATE THROUGH AN AMPLITUDE OF AT LEAST HALF AN INCH WHICH COULD BE EASILY SEEN IN ALL PARTS OF THE ROOM THE FUNCTION OF THE SOFT RUBBER TUBING IS TO CONSERVE THE ENERGY OF THE FORKS IN THEMSELVES THUS PREVENTING THE DISSIPATION OF ENERGY TO THE TABLE WHICH RESULTS WHEN THEY REST DIRECTLY UPON THE TABLE II A DEMONSTRATION EXPERIMENT ON ABSORPTION USING SUNLIGHT OR PARALLEL RAYS FROM A PROJECTION LANTERN AND A SINGLE SLIT OF THE OPTICAL DISC FIRST PLACE A PIECE OF HEAVY PLATE GLASS SILVERED ON THE BACK IN THE PATH OF THE RAYS AND 1READ AT THE PHYSICS DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCE OF ACADEMIES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS IN RELATIONS WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO NOVEMBER 12 I9I0 I14MODIFICATIONS OF OLD EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSICS OBTAIN THE MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS OF THE BEAM UPON THE DISC AS IN FIG I THEN REPLACE THE PIECE OF SILVERED PLATE GLASS WITH A  C D  FAGB ONE WHICH HAS BEEN COVERED ON THE BACK WITH A MIXTURE OF LAMPBLACK AND BANANA OIL IN THE SECOND CASE THE ONLY REFLECTION OBTAINED IS AT THE FIRST SURFACE THE BEAM WHICH PASSES INTO THE GLASS BEING SO COMPLETELY ABSORBED WHEN IT REACHES THE BLACKENED SURFACE THAT MULTIPLE REFLECTION DOES NOT TAKE PLACE SEE FIG 2 4 N3CKCDBBACK FI 2I THE EXPERIMENT ALSO SHOWS THAT WHEN REFLECTION TAKES PLACE FROM A MIRROR MOST OF THE LIGHT IS REFLECTED BY THE SILVERED SURFACE FOR THE BEAM B FROM THE BACK OF THE MIRROR IS MUCH MORE INTENSE THAN THE BEAM A OR ANY OF THE MULTIPLE REFLECTIONS FOLLOWING B III A CONVENIENT METHOD OF PROJECTION PLACE THE ELECTROSCOPE OR WHATEVER IS TO BE PROJECTED UPON THE SCREEN IMMEDIATELY IN FRONT OF THE OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJEC TION LANTERN THUS USING THE WHOLE LANTERN AS A CONDENSER THEN PLACE A CONVEX LENS IN FRONT OF THE OBJECT AND MOVE IT TOWARD THE SCREEN UNTIL THE OBJECT IS DISTINCTLY FOCUSED ON THE SCREEN THE OBJECT AND SCREEN THEN BEING AT CONJUGATE FOCI THE PROPER II5THE SCHOOL REVIEW FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LENS WILL DEPEND ON THE MAGNIFICATION DESIRED AND THE DISTANCE TO THE SCREEN FOR MOST PURPOSES A LENS OF FOCAL LENGTH BETWEEN TWENTY AND THIRTY CENTIMETERS WILL BE FOUND SUITABLE A GLASS TANK OF ANY DIMENSIONS MAY BE PLACED IN FRONT OF THE LANTERN AND USED TO CONTAIN THE ELEMENTS OF A VOLTAIC CELL AND WHEN THE ELECTRODES ARE FOCUSED ON THE SCREEN IT MAKES A VERY CONVENIENT METHOD OF SHOWING SUCH PHENOMENA AS EFFECT OF AMALGAMATING ZINC PLATES FORMATION OF HYDROGEN AT THE POSI TIVE ELECTRODE ETC THE METHOD IS CONVENIENT FOR PROJECTING MANY OTHER EXPERI MENTS UPON THE SCREEN IV A MODIFICATION OF AN EXPERIMENT ON AIR PRESSURE TAKE TWO GLASS CONSTANTWEIGHT HYDROMETER TUBES FIFTY OR SIXTY CENTIMETERS LONG SUCH AS ARE USED IN MILLIKAN AND GALES LABORATORY COURSE THE TWO TUBES BEING OF THE PROPER DIAMETER SO THATONE SLIDES EASILY INTO THE OTHER FILL THE LARGER ONE WITH WATER PUSH THE SMALLER ONE PART WAY DOWN INTO IT INVERT BOTH AND THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR WILL FORCE THE SMALLER TUBE COMPLETELY INTO THE LARGER ONE WHEN THE WHOLE IS SUPPORTED BY LHOLDING THE LARGER ONE IN THE HAND OR A CLAMP IF THE TUBES FIT VERY CLOSELY THE ACTION WILL TAKE PLACE MORE RAPIDLY WHEN GASOLINE IS USED IN PLACE OF WATER AS THE GASOLINE RUNS OUT BETWEEN THE TUBES MORE EASILY V A MODIFICATION OF THE CARTESIAN DIVER OR A FAKE LUNG TESTER INVERT A SMALL PILL BOTTLE PARTLY FILLED WITH AIR BUT NOT SUFFICIENTLY TO FLOAT IN A FLAT BOTTLE FILLED WITH WATER WITH THE AID OF A FINELY DRAWN OUT TUBE WITH A J ON THE LOWER END AND A RUBBER FROM A PEN FILLER ON THE TOP FORCE FINE BUBBLES OF AIR INTO THE PILL BOTTLE UNTIL IT JUST RISES TO THE SURFACE IT WILL THEN BE VERY DELICATELY BALANCED SO THAT A SMALL INCREASE IN PRESSURE WILL CAUSE THE DIVER TO DESCEND THEN CORK THE BOTTLE WITH A RUBBER STOPPER INTO WHICH IS INSERTED PART WAY A GLASS TUBE ATTACH A PIECE OF RUBBER TUBING TO THE GLASS TUBE TO BLOW UPON II6MODIFICATIONS OF OLD EXPERIMENTS IN PHYSICS THE PRESSURE WHICH CAUSES THE DIVER TO DESCEND IS OBTAINED BY PRESSING UPON THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLE THIS CAN BE DONE UNOB SERVED BY BLOWING ON THE TUBE WHILE THE BOTTLE IS HELD IN THE HANDS THE APPARATUS IS THEN GIVEN TO A FRIEND OR MEMBER OF THE CLASS WHO ATTEMPTS TO BLOW THE DIVER DOWN BUT OF COURSE FAILS IF A SLIGHT PRESSURE ON THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLE FAILS TO CAUSE THE DIVER TO DESCEND FORCE THE STOPPER INTO THE BOTTLE A LITTLE WITH A ROTARY MOTION UNTIL THE DIVER JUST STARTS DOWN AND THEN THE ADDED PRESSURE NECESSARY TO SEND IT DOWN MAY EASILY BE OBTAINED BY PRESSING THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLE BETWEEN THE THUMB AND FINGER AN OUTFIT LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE THE ONE JUST DESCRIBED MAY BE MADE TO ACCOMPANY IT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT THE GLASS TUBE RUNS COMPLETELY THROUGH THE STOPPER INSTEAD OF PART WAY THIS DIVER CAN THEN BE FORCED DOWN BY BLOWING ON THE TUBE BUT NOT BY PRESSING ON THE BOTTLE THE REVERSE OF THE OTHER ONE THE DIVER IN THE FIRST OUTFIT MAY BE SO DELICATELY BALANCED THAT WHEN FORCED DOWN BY PRESSURE FROM THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLE IT WILL STAY AT THE BOTTOM DUE TO THE PRESSURE OF THE LIQUID ABOVE IT MAY THEN BE CAUSED TO ASCEND BY PRESSING LIGHTLY ON THE EDGES OF THE BOTTLE THUS RELIEVING SOME OF THE PRESSURE DUE TO ITS BEING CORKED TIGHTLY IT IS VERY INTERESTING TO SEE HOW EVEN A HEAVY FLAT BOTTLE WILL THUS HAVE ITS VOLUME DIMINISHED BY A SLIGHT PRESSURE ON THE FLAT SIDES AND INCREASED BY A SLIGHT PRES SURE ON THE EDGES VI A LABORATORY METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE INDEX OF REFRACTION TAKE A RECTANGULAR BATTERY JAR ABOUT TWENTY OR TWENTYFIVE CENTIMETERS DEEP FASTEN A PIECE OF FINE WHITE THERMOMETER TUBING T ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE BOTTOM AND PASTE A PAPER SCALE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE JAR SO THAT ITS ZERO END IS EVEN WITH THE UPPER EDGE OF THE THERMOMETER TUBING SEE FIG 3 WITH THE AID OF ANOTHER PIECE OF THE SAME KIND OF TUBING HELD JUST OUTSIDE THE JAR LOCATE BY THE METHOD OF PARALLAX THE IMAGE II7THE SCHOOL REVIEW T OF THE TUBE IN THE BOTTOM OF THE JAR THE READING AT THE TOP OF THE TUBE OUTSIDE SUBTRACTED FROM THE DEPTH OF THE WATER WILL THEN GIVE THE DISTANCE OF THE IMAGE BELOW THE SURFACE CALL THIS DISTANCE I CALL THE DISTANCE FROM THE TOP OF THE TUBING IN THE JAR TO THE SURFACE OF WATER O THIS IS READ OFF DIRECTLY ON THE SCALE THEN THE INDEX OF REFRACTION NOI THE FOLLOWING VALUES FOR THE INDEX OF REFRACTION OF WATER WERE OBTAINED FROM TEN SUCCESSIVE INDEPENDENT OBSERVATIONS 135I 1338 I333 I338 1327 I346 I332 I339 I34I I323

conveyed a plantation to her two sons by two voluntary conveyances The first deed purported to convey four hundred acres to the younger son and the second deed conveyed to the elder son all the remaining part of the plantation After the death of the grantor it was found that the first deed instead of conveying four hundred acres as was intended conveyed only three hundred seventeen acres Upon a petition brought by the younger son the equity court decreed reformation of the deed Spencer v Spencer Miss 1917 75 So 770 The jurisdiction of a chancery court to reform deeds where by mistake they fail to carry out the intention of the parties is well recognized Here as in all cases the general rule subject to some exceptions is that equity will not aid a volunteer This rule is strictly applied where reformation is sought against the voluntary grantor Lister v Hodgson 1867 L R 4 Eq 30 On principle the situation is quite different where the grantor himself seeks the reformation and in such cases the courts generally grant the relief Lackersteen v Lackersteen 1861 30 L J Eq 5 Mitchell v Mitchell 1869 40 Ga 11 Crockett v Crockett 1884 73 Ga 647 More difficulty arises where the case comes up after the death of the grantor Some juris dictions lay down the principle that reformation will not be decreed save with the consent of all the parties Tuthill v Katz 1913 174 Mich 217 140 N W 519 other jurisdictions take a broader view and decree reformation even without the consent of the parties where the facts show clear equities in favor of the complainant MMechan v Warburton 1896 Ir L R 1 Ch 435 see Lister v Hodgson supra Thus where reformation tends toward a more just distribution of prop erty MMechan v Warburton supra Stedwell v Anderson 1851 21 Conn 139 the relief is granted while if it tends toward a more unjust distribution Enos v Stewart 1902 138 Cal 112 70 Pac 1005 Willey v Hodge 1899 104 Wis 81 80 N W 75 Triesback v Tyler 1911 62 Fla 580 56 So 947 the court refuses to act A clearer case is presented where the grantor has intended to and by a voluntary con veyance inter vivos has parted with his entire interest Such is the instant case where the rights of heirs and personal representatives of the grantor are eliminated Some courts in such a case resort to a fiction of a family settlement see Miles v Miles 1904 84 Miss 624 37 So 112 Cummings v Freer 1872 26 Mich 128 treating the situation as though the parties had held the land in common and then partitioned it each conveyance serving as consideration for every other conveyance other courts adopting the same equitable doctrine that is adopted in the cases above consider the case from the stand point of a balance of equities and decree reformation where they find that a party holds property which in justice and good conscience should belong to another Wyche v Greene 1854 16 Ga 49 Adair v McDonald 1871 42 Ga 506 In the principal case the defendant had acted in a most unconscientious manner in relation to the con veyances there were strong equities in favor of the complainant and the court very justly in the exercise of its discretion ordered a reforma tion of the deed EJECTMENTPOSSIBILITY OF REVERTER AFTER A DETERMINABLE FEE ALIENATIONA grantor conveyed land with the provision that it should revert whenever the grantee ceased to use it for certain specified purposes Afterwards he conveyed his remaining interest 84RECENT DECISIONS 85 to a second grantee unconditionally After the grantors death the first grantee ceased to use the land for the specified purposes Held the second grantee and not the grantors heirs was entitled to the land Irby v Smith Ga 1917 93 S E 877 Determinable fees simple have clearly been recognized by the courts of this country 1 Tiffany Real Property  81 and under the conveyance in the principal case the first grantee takes a determinable fee simple leaving a possibility of reverter in the grantor First Universalist Society v Boland 1892 155 Mass 171 29 N E 524 North v Graham 1908 235 Ill 178 85 N E 267 It has often been said that a possibility of reverter after a determinable fee cannot be assigned as it is not an interest in land but a mere possibility of receiving back an interest that has been granted to another 1 Tiffany op cit  81 North v Graham supra Pond v Douglass 1909 106 Me 85 75 Atl 320 see Vaughan v Langford 1908 81 S 0 282 62 S E 316 There are however decisions holding that this possibility of reverter may be assigned Slegel v Lauer 1892 148 Pa 236 23 Atl 996 Greens Admr v Irvine Ky 1902 66 S W 278 The tendency of the courts would seem to be to allow a greater freedom of alienation Tiedeman Real Property 3rd ed  307 so although contingent remainders could not be assigned at common law Mudge v Hammill 1899 21 R I 283 43 Atl 544 a number of courts under statutes providing for the transfer of any interest in land hold them alienable when the person who will take upon the happening of the contingency is ascertained Morse v Proper 1888 82 Ga 13 8 S E 625 McDonald v Bayard Savings Bank 1904 123 Iowa 413 98 N W 1025 Godman v Simmons 1892 113 Mo 122 20 S W 972 The principal case in holding the possibility of reverter after a deter miinable fee assignable is in keeping with this tendency If the conveyance to the second grantee had been with covenants of title and for a valuable consideration the case could also be supported upon the ground that he acquired an equitable right to have the land conveyed to him by the grantors heirs when it reverted to them Goodson v Beacham 1858 24 Ga 150 ELECTIONSERRORS IN PRINTING THE NAME OF A CANDIDATE ON THE BALLOTElection officials through a mistake printed the name of one Johnson for that of the contestant as the regular Democratic nominee on the ballots of a certain district The votes cast for John son were sufficient to determine the election IHeld three judges dis senting that the votes cast for Johnson were intended to be cast for the contestant the regular Democratic nominee and therefore are to be counted for him Bradley v Cox Mo 1917 197 S W 88 It is a primary rule of election law that whenever possible the voters rights will be saved People ex rel Hirsh v Wood 1895 148 N Y 142 42 N E 536 Powers v Smith 1892 11 Mo 45 20 S W 101 and unless a statute expressly stipulates that no ballots shall be counted for failure to comply with its provisions it will be held to be directory rather than mandatory where the irregularity in the ballots is attacked after the election Town of Grove v IHaskell 1909 24 Okla 707 104 Pac 56 Furthermore if the error in the ballots is caused by the fault of officials in preparing them the court will effectuate the intention of the voter if it can be clearly ascertained It has therefore been established that slight errors in the printing of the ballot will not invalidate them North v McMahan 1910 26

EXISTENCE TAIN IF POSSIBLE THE EXISTENCE OF THE CURRENT AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF ITS DELICACY WILL NOT BE NECESSARY IT IS SUFFICIENTLY SO TO INDICATE THE EXISTENCE OF A CURRENT DURING THE COMBINATION OF AN ACID WITH AN ALKALI SUCH AS VERY DILUTE SOLUTIONS OF NITRIC ACID AND OF POTASH WHEN SEPARATED BY A MEMBRANE IN SEVERAL UNSUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENTS THE FOLLOWING ELECTRODES WERE USED TWO PLATINUM WIRES HNTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS AND ELEVEN INCHES IN LENGTH WERE POINTED AT ONE EXTREMITY TO BE EASILY INSERTED INTO A BLOODVESSEL OR AN ORGAN AND COATED WITH SEALINGWAX FOR ABOUT TWO INCHES LEAVING THE EXTREME POINT BARE TO THE EXTENT OF ONEFOURTH OF AN INCH THE OTHER EXTREMITIES BEING ATTACHED TO THE GALVANOMETER BUT DURING THE INQUIRY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE STIFFNESS OF THE WIRES FORMING THE ELEC TRODES OCCASIONING A MOTION OF THE WHOLE INSTRUMENT WHEN MAKING AND BREAKING CONTACT THE FOLLOWING ALTERATION WAS MADE IN THE ARRANGEMENT THICK COPPER WIRES TEN INCHES IN LENGTH WERE CONNECTED WITH THE GALVANOMETER BY THE SCREWS AND EACH OF THE FREE EXTREMITIES SO BENT AS TO REST IN A SEPARATE WOODEN CUP CONTAINING MERCURY A PLATINUM PLATE AN INCH SQUARE WAS ATTACHED TO ONE EXTREMITY OF EACH OF THE PLATINUM ELECTRODES TO INCREASE THE EXTENT OF SURFACE AND BEING PLACED IN THE WOODEN CUPS A COMMUNICATION WAS FORMED WITH THE GALVANOMETER BY MEANS OF THE MERCURY THE POINTED EXTREMITIES SERVING AS BEFORE TO BE INSERTED INTO THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE ANIMAL GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN TO ASCERTAIN THAT THE DIFFERENT CONTACTS WERE PERFECT AND NO RESULT UPON THE NEEDLE OCCURRED FROM THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT WHEN A CIRCUIT WAS FORMED WITH A WEAK SOLUTION OF SALT OR WATER PREVIOUS TO EACH EXPERIMENT IT WILL BE UNNECESSARY TO RELATE THE EXPERIMENTS THIRTEEN IN NUMBER UPON CATS KITTENS A GUINEAPIG AND RABBITS IN WHICH AN ENDEAVOUR WAS MADE TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE EFFECT OF A DIVERTED CURRENT MIGHT NOT BE OBTAINED BY INSERTING THE ELEC TRODES INTO THE PORTAL VEIN ALONE

CAN THE DIFFERENCE WHICH IS OBSERVED BETWEEN CATS AND RABBITS AS TO THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT WHEN THE STOMACH AND LIVER ARE FORMED INTO A CIRCUIT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACTION OF THE POISON ALTHOUGH

OTHER THAT OF AN ALKALI TAKES NEGATIVE ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN WELL ESTABLISHED BY BECQUEREL THE RESULTS OBSERVED IN THE LAST EXPERIMENT BEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATE IT AND AT THE SAME TIME SHOWV HOW IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO SAY A PRIORI WHAT WOULD BE THE EFFECT UPON THE NEEDLE WHEN THE ELECTRODES ARE INSERTED INTO DIFFERENT PARTS OF A DEAD ANIMAL THE MERE CIRCUMSTANCE OF PLACING THE ELECTRODES IN CONTACT WITH DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THE CONTENTS OF THE STOMACH PRO DUCES AN EFFECT OR NOT UPON THE NEEDLE THE STATE OF THE PARTS AS TO MOISTURE AND THE TRANSUDATION OF THE SECRETED FLUIDS OR CONTENTS

ELECTRODES EACH OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE READILY SEEN TO BE INFLUENTIAL AND UNNECESSARY TO PARTICULARIZE THERE MAY BE TWO OR THREE ACTING POINTS BETWEEN THE ELECTRODES DETERMINING THE CURRENT IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS OR ASSISTING EACH OTHER THE ACTION UPON THE NEEDLE BEING THE RESULT OF A DIFFERENTIAL OR OF A COMBINED CURRENT ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL WE BE JUSTIFIED IN REFERRING THE

BEING EMPTY AND THEREFORE UNINFLUENCED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE JUST NOW MENTIONED WHY DID THE EFFECT NOT OCCUR IN EXPERIMENT 11  THE CONDITIONS APPEARED TO BE PRE CISELY SIMILAR OR IN EXPERIMENTS 7 AND 10 WHEN THE ARTERY WAS WOUNDED OR IN EXPE RIMENTS 3 AND 4 WHEN BLOOD FLOWING FROM A DIFFERENT PART FORMED THE CIRCUIT OR IN EXPERIMENTS 3 5 9 WHEN A CIRCUIT WAS FORMED BETWEEN THE INSIDE AND

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

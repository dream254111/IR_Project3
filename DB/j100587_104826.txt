LECTURES O N MUSCULAR MOTION FOR THE YEAR MDCCXLVI READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY J A M E S P A R S O N S M D AND F R S BEING A SUPPLEMENT TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THAT YEAR      AD

IS TOO LARGE A TITLE TO PUT BEFORE THIS LITTLE TREATISE AS IT SIGNIFIES A VIEW OF NATURE IN GENERAL BUT SINCE THE TERM METOPOSCOPY WHICH DENOTES OPINIONS ARISING FROM A VIEW OF THE FACE ALONE AND WHICH INDEED WOULD BE BETTER ADAPTED TO WHAT I TREAT OF IS LESS UNDERSTOOD THAN THE OTHER AND AS MOST PEOPLE NOW A DAYS MEAN NO MORE BY THE FORMER THAN WHAT RE GARDS THE COUNTERNANCE I HOPE I MAY BE EXCUSED TAKING THAT WHICH IS THE MOST FAMILIAR TERM II THIS SUBJECT HAS BEEN HANDLED BY A GREAT NUMBER OF AUTHORS NOT ONE OF WHOM THAT I KNOW OF HAS PURSUED THE PLAN UPON WHICH I PROCEED THAT IS WHAT REGARDS THE PROPER ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE AND THEIR PARTICULAR OBEDIENCE TO THE INFLU ENCE OF THE MIND JOHNII P R E F A C E JOHN BULWER WHOSE BOOK I HAD NEVER HEARD OF TILL MY INTIRE TREATISE EXCEPT THE LIST OF AUTHORS AND THIS PREFACE WAS PRINTED OFF MAKES AN ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THIS SUBJECT AS THE TITLE OF HIS BOOK SETS FORTH BUT IT IS FILLD WITH MANY EXTRAVAGANT NOTIONS FROM DIFFERENT AUTHORS AND IS SO FAR FROM ASCERTAIN ING THE PECULIAR OFFICE OF ANY ONE MUSCLE OF THE FACE THAT HE THINKS THEY ALL ACT ONE AGAINST ANOTHER TO FORM LAUGHTER AND CALLS IN BLOOD AND SPIRITS TO FILL THE FACE IN THE SAME MANNER THAT THE MEMBRUM VIRILE IS FILLD WITH MANY OTHER SUCH FANCIES THRO THE WHOLE WHICH OUR ROOM HERE WILL NOT ADMIT US TO ANIMADVERT BUT I HAVE REJECTED EVERY OTHER METHOD MADE USE OF BEFORE AND IN THE PROGRESS ADDED SOME NEW OBSERVATIONS TO THE DESCRIPTION OF THE MUSCLES WHICH ARE THE TRUE AGENTS OF EVERY PAS SION OF THE MIND AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH OUR DOCTRINE IS FOUNDED WHEREIN IF I HAVE NOT SUC CEEDED AS PERFECTLY AS I COULD WISH I HOPE IT WILL AT LEAST BE ALLOWED THE ONLY TRUE SCHEME FOR UNDER STANDING THAT ART III I HAVE ENDEAVOURD TO MAKE THESE LECTURES AS EN TERTAINING AS I COULD AND AS INSTRUCTIVE WHEREBY ANY ONE VERSED IN THE ART OF INFERREDDESIGNINGINFERRED MAY BE ABLE TO REPRESENT THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND UPON THE FACE BY DINT OF HIS KNOWLEGE OF THE MUSCULAR STRUCTURE AND AS THE NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIONS IS BUT SMALL WHICH SERVES FOR THEIR EXPRESSION THERE WAS NO NEED OF MULTIPLYING THEM TO A REPETITION OF DESIGNS THAT MUST MAKE CONFUSION HAD A CERTAIN GREATP R E F A C E III GREAT MAN BEEN LEARNED IN THIS PART OF ANATOMY HE WOULD HAVE MADE FEWER SERVE HIS PURPOSE AND NOT ALLOWD DIFFERENT MOTIONS TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS AT THE SAME TIME NOR HAVE MADE THE INFERREDWRINKLESINFERRED OF THE FOREHEAD LONGITUDINAL WHICH SHOULD HAVE BEEN TRANSVERSE OR HORIZONTAL BY THE ACTION OF THIS MUSCLE NOR IS THERE IN A WORD ANY NECESSITY TO DRAW THE HAIR STANDING UPRIGHT TO EXAGGE RATE HIS FIGURES IN ANY WISE WHICH IS UNNATURAL FOR THE ACTIONS OF THE COUNTENANCE ALONE WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO EXPRESS THE PASSIONS SINCE ITS MUSCLES ARE THE SOLE AGENTS IV FOR THIS REASON I HAVE AVOIDED CHANGING THE ATTI TUDE IN THE EXPRESSION OF ANY ONE OF MY FIGURES CHUSING RATHER TO REPRESENT THEM AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE ON THE SAME KIND OF FACE WHEREON NO CHANGE IS VISIBLE BUT WHAT PROCEEDS FROM THE PARTICULAR ALTERATIONS OF THE MUSCLES PECULIAR TO EACH PASSION V AND IN ORDER TO RENDER THIS TREATISE THO VERY SHORT THE MORE COMPLETE I HAVE ADDED A LIST OF THE NAMES AND WORKS OF THE AUTHORS UPON THIS SUBJECT AND A GENERAL INDEX TO THESE AND MY FORMER LECTURES ON MUSCULAR MOTION FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF SUCH AS HAVE THEM WHICH WILL MAKE THE WHOLE THE MORE PERFECT WHEN BOUND UP TOGETHER VIIV P R E F A C E VI THE MASTERS IN THE ART OF DESIGNING I HOPE WILL EXCUSE ANY LITTLE FAULTS THAT MAY OCCUR AS TO WHAT RELATES TO THE DRAWING IN MY FIGURES FOR I HAVE NO PRETENSIONS TO BE CORRECT IN THAT PART NOR ANY OTHER VIEW IN THIS WORK THAN TO DEMONSTRATE AND EXPLAIN THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES ON THE COUNTENANCE AS A STANDARD FOR PHYSIOGNOMY IN WHICH THOSE OF BOTH SEXES MOVE UPON THE INFERREDSAMEINFERRED PRINCIPLES AND BY INGE NIOUS PAINTERS MAY BE EXPRESSED ON EITHER ONLY BY MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR THE DELICACY OF THE ONE AND THE ROUGHNEFS OF THE OTHER WHEN ONCE DULY VERSED IN THE ANATOMICAL PRINCIPLES VII I CANNOT OMIT TAKING THIS OPPORTUNITY OF GIVING DUE HONOUR TO OUR PAINTERS IN ENGLAND NOT WITH STANDING THE LABERTIES A LATE FRENCH AUTHOR HAS TAKEN WITH THEM MANY OF WHOM ARE CAP  OF ANY BRANCH OF THE INFERREDALLINFERRED AS THEIR SEVERAL CURIOUS PERFORM ANCES IN MANY PLACES  ABOUT THIS KINGDOM CAN INFERREDTESSISYINFERRED WE DO NOT WANT THOSE WHO PAINT IN HISTORY LANDSKIP CONVERSATION AND ARCHITECTURE IN GREAT PERFECTION ALTHO THERE IS SCARCE ENCOURAGEMENT HERE FOR ANY BRANCH BUT LITTLE PORTRAITS AND IF WE WERE  ST PAULS CHURCH ST BARTHOLOMEWS THE FOUNDLING AND GREEN WICH  AS WELL AS IN THE CABINETS OF MANY NOBLEMEN AND GENTLEMAN THROUGHOUT ENGLANDP R E F A C E V WERE BLESSD WITH THE SAME ACADEMICAL ENDOWMENTS THAT OTHER NATIONS CAN BOAST OF WE SHOULD UN DOUBTEDLY HAVE AS GREAT PROFICIENTS IN THE ARTS OF PAINTING AND SCULPTURE AS ANY NATION FOR IT IS NO TORIOUS THAT OUR YOUTH HAVE MADE AS GOOD A FIGURE IN FOREIGN ACADEMIES AS ANY THAT WERE EDUCATED AT THEM AND WE HAVE EVEN HAD SOME WHO BY DINT OF GENIUS HAVE BORN AWAY THE PRIZES FROM THOSE OF EVERY OTHER NATION VIII BUT NOT TO DWELL UNNECESSARILY UPON WHAT ALL THE WORLD EXCEPT THE AUTHOR IN QUESTION KNOWS WE CAN NOT BUT FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING REFLECTIONS EVERY ONE FROM THE FIRST DAWN OF HIS UNDERSTANDING IS BORNE AWAY BY THE TORRENT OF PARTIALITY TILL A GENEROUS EDU CATION WEARS IT OFF AND QUALIFIES THE MAN FOR PASSING AN IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT UPON EVERY THING THAT COMES BEFORE HIM AND THIS IS EVER MASTER OF THE UNHAPPY WRETCH WHO HAS HAD NO SUCH ADVANTAGE NOW IT WAS STRANGE TO FIND THE DUST OF PREJUDICE HAD SO BLINDED THE EYES OF THAT AUTHOR WHO HAS THE RE PUTATION OF A MAN OF LEARNING THAT AT HIS ARRIVAL IN ENGLAND HE WAS SCARCE ABLE TO DISCERN ANY THING BUT FAULTS AND DEFECTS THRO THE WHOLE KINGDOM WHILST AT HOME THERE WAS HARDLY AN IMPERFECTION BUT IT MAY BE SUPPOSED HE HAD A MIND TO GIVE THE WORLD A SPECIMEN OF HIS ABILITIES IN SATIRE IX SATIRE REQUIRES A VERY REFIND GENIUS AND TASTE TO CARRY IT ON WHETHER IN PROSE OR VERSE FOR WHEN B CENSUREVI P R E F A C E CENSURE IS AIMED POINTBLANK IT AMOUNTS TO NO MORE THAN PLAIN BILLINGSGATE OR AS THE FRENCH HAVE IT CRIAILLER OU ECRIRE EN GRONDANT I WISH I WERE ABLE TO DISCERN THE PROFUNDITY OF HIS WIT IN SAYING AMONG MANY OTHER THINGS  ENGLAND HAS NOT HITHERTO BRED ONE PAINTER A INFERREDETINFERREDC THAT HERE HUNT ING SEEMS TO BE THE PASSION OF ALL AGES AND SEXES B HIS ANIMADVERSIONS UPON WHICH HE HAS HAPPLILY CON CLUDED WITH A SUBLIME TALE OF A POSTBOY AND THAT IT WAS LAZINESS THAT MADE SHAKESPEAR WRITE SEVERAL TRAGEDIES IN PROSE C  NOW TO ANSWER THESE ASSERTIONS IN THE STILE OF THE ABBE THE NATURAL RE PLY WOULD BE POINTBLANK  CE N EST PAS VRIA BUT WE WILL NOT SO FAR IMITATE HIM NO LET US USE HIM WITH MORE POLITENEFS AND RATHER RECOMMEND TO HIM WHEN HE NEXT INTENDS TO WRITE LETTERS TO STUDY THOSE OF AN ENGLISH AUTHOR D FIRST WHICH WANT NEITHER DELICACY TRUTH NOR DESIGN WHERE THE SATIRE IS KEEN YET PLEASING AND NOT STUFFD WITH TAME CRAWLING NARRATIVES X JUDGMENT IS MOST LIKELY TO BE GENUINE WHERE IT IS ENGAGED IN THE DISCOVERY RATHER OF BEAUTIES THAN FAULTS AND IS BUT BARELY HONEST WHEN IT IS CAPABLE OF SEEING SOME BEAUTIES AS WELL AS FAULTS A CUR SORY SPECTATOR IN RUNNING THRO A KINGDOM IS NOT TO CONDEMN OR RIDICULE THE CUSTOMS HE FINDS ONLY BECAUSE A VOL I LETT 23 B LETT 46 C LETT 31 D MR LITTLETONS PERSIAN LETTERSP R E F A C E VII BECAUSE HE KNOWS NOT THE REASON OF ANY ONE AND IT IS SO IN A LANGUAGE WHICH MAY TO A STRANGER SEEM RIDICULOUS ONLY BECAUSE HE IS IGNORANT OF ITS PROPER IDIOM THE CUSTOMS OF ALL COUNTRIES ARISE CHIEFLY FROM SOME NECESSARY CAUSE AND ARE ADAPTED AND CONTINUED BY THE SAME LAW THO PERHAPS WITH SOME ADDITIONAL CONVENIENCES AND SINCE THOSE OF DIFFERENT NATIONS MUST ALWAYS DIFFER FROM EACH OTHER IT SEEMS TO ME AS INJUDICIOUS TO RIDICULE THEM AS TO GRUMBLE BECAUSE THE PERSONS OF THE ENGLISH ARE NOT EXACTLY LIKE THOSE OF THE FRENCH XI HERE IS A SINGULAR INSTANCE IN A MAN OF LEARNING WHO COULD FIND BUT VERY FEW MEN OF GENIUS OR GOOD THINGS OUT OF HIS OWN COUNTRY THIS STRANGE LOVE FOR HIS OWN FIRESIDE PUTS ME IN MIND OF A HOTTENTOT BOY WHO WAS TAKEN UP YOUNG BY THE DUTCH EDUCATED AND SUPPLIED WITH EVERY THING THAT COULD ENGAGE THE APPROBATION AND SATISFACTION OF SUCH A ONE FOR SEVERAL YEARS YET HE WAS NOT CONTENT BUT MADE USE OF THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK TO HIS OWN PEOPLE AMONG WHOM HE HAD NO SOONER ARRIVED THAN HE HASTILY THREW OFF HIS CLOATHS FLEW TO THE NEXT SHAMBLES AND THERE IN AN INSTANT CLAD HIM SELF WITH THE GARBAGE HE FOUND WHICH WITH PLEASURE HE ROLLED ROUND HIS LIMBS AND BODY FURNISHING HIM SELF AT ONCE WITH FOOD AND RAIMENT MORE AGREEABLE TO HIM THAN THE NECESSARIES BETTER SUITED TO THE WEL FARE OF HUMAN LIFE WITH WHICH HE WAS SUPPLIED BE FORE  BUT ENOUGH OF THE LEARNED ABBE AND OF THE HOTTENTOT B 2 XIIVIII P R E F A C E XII WHEN THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAD ORDERD THAT I SHOULD READ THESE LECTURES I LAID HOLD OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD THIS PART OF THE PHYSIOLOGICAL SYSTEM UPON AN ANATOMICAL FOUNDATION AND I FLATTER MYSELF IT WILL APPEAR THE MOST LIKELY TO ANSWER ALL THE PHAE NOMENA OF METOPOSCOPY HEREAFTER IT WILL NO DOUBT BE CARRIED FARTHER AND PERHAPS BE SET IN A MORE AD VANTAGEOUS LIGHT BY INDUSTRIOUS ANATOMISTS AND THO THE SUBJECT ADMITTED OF MANY DIFFICULTIES YET THE CANDOUR OF THE SOCIETY UPON HEARING THE LECTURES READ ENCOURAGED ME TO MAKE SOME IMPROVEMENTS UPON WHAT THEY HAD HEARD IN ORDER TO BRING IT THUS FAR AND WHATEVER IS WANTING IN THE PERFECTION OF IT THE AUTHORS INTENTION TO IMPROVE NATURAL KNOW LEGE IT IS TO BE HOPED WILL MAKE SOME APOLOGY AND BESPEAK FOR IT THE MORE CANDID RECEPTION OF SUCH AS HAVE PLEASURE IN THESE KINDS

I H A V E THE HONOUR GENTLEMEN TO APPEAR ONCE MORE BEFORE YOU ON AC COUNT OF THE CROUNIAN LECTURE BE ING COMMANDED TO IT BY THE WORTHY P R E S I D E N T AND COUNCIL OF THIS MOST LEARNED SOCIETY AND COULD WISH MY ABILITIES WERE BUT EQUAL TO MY WILL IN MY COMPLIANCE WITH THAT DUTY I SHOULD NOT THEN DELAY A MOMENT TO OFFER WITH THE UTMOST OF MY POWER WHAT WOULD CONDUCE NOT ONLY TO THE WELFARE OF THE PUBLIC BUT ALSO TO YOUR BETTER AMUSEMENT READ NOV 20 1746 B II2 II THE BENEVOLENT FOUNDER OF THIS LECTURE HAS INDEED CIRCUMSCRIBED IT WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS BY CON FINING IT IN THIS SOCIETY TO THE PHYSIOLOGY OF THE MOTION OF THE MUSCLES ALONE WHEREAS HAD HE AL LOWD IT TO BE MORE GENERALLY ANATOMICAL THE UNDER TAKER WOULD FIND SEVERAL VERY PLEASING FIELDS TO RANGE IN RELATING TO THE ANIMAL OECONOMY NOT YET TAKEN NO TICE OF THAT ARE CAPABLE OF STRIKING THE HEARERS WITH AMAZEMENT AND OF PRODUCING IN THE ROYAL SOCIETY YET A GREATER REGARD FOR THE MOST STUPENDOUS AND CURIOUS SUBJECTS IN ALL NATURE III AS TO THE INVENTION OF ANY MORE SYSTEMS TOWARDS THE EXPLANATION OF ANIMAL MOTIONS I CONFESS I THINK IT A LABOUR AS MUCH IN VAIN AS THE PUNISHMENT OF SISYPHUS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT UTTERLY IMPOSSIBLE EVER TO RENDER IT FAMILIAR TO ANY HUMAN PERCEPTION HOWEVER NEARER ONE AUTHORS OPINION MAY APPROACH THE TRUTH THAN THAT OF ANOTHER AND THEREFORE I TAKE THE LIBERTY HERE TO RECOMMEND TO WHOMSOEVER SHALL HEREAFTER BE APPOINTED TO MAKE THIS LECTURE TO CON FINE IT TO THE DESCRIPTION OF MUSCLES AND TO WHATEVER NEW OBSERVATIONS MAY OCCUR WITH RESPECT TO THE SEN SIBLE MOTIONS OF THEM NOT HITHERTO TAKEN NOTICE OF TOGETHER WITH MORE FAMILIAR AND EXACT DRAWINGS OF THEM THAN HAVE ALREADY APPEARD TO THE LEARNED WORLD THUS MAY SEVERAL USEFUL DEDUCTIONS BE MADE FROM A METHOD OF THIS NATURE A CORRECTORIUM BE PRODUCED FOR ALL FORMER TREATISES OF THE MUSCLES AND3 AND AT LENGTH A NEW GENERAL HISTORY OF THEM AP PEAR ARISING FROM THE SUCCESSIVE LABOURS OF SOME OF THE MEMBERS OF THIS SOCIETY IV WITH THIS VIEW AND AS A BEGINNING TO SUCH A PLAN I SHALL NOW ATTEMPT TO GIVE YOU A DESCRIPTION OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS AND REMARKS WHICH I HOPE WILL APPEAR CURIOUS TO YOU RELATING TO THEIR SEPARATE AS WELL AS CONJUNCT ACTIONS AND THE APPEARANCES OF THE COUNTENANCE THAT ARE THE NATURAL EFFECTS OF SUCH ACTIONS TO GETHER WITH ACCURATE DRAWINGS WHICH WILL SERVE TO THEIR BETTER DEMONSTRATION AND WHICH I CHOSE TO LAY BEFORE YOU RATHER THAN A DISSECTED HEAD AS BEING I AM PERSUADED A MUCH LESS AGREEABLE SIGHT TO MANY AMONG US THAN A FAIR DRAWING V TO PROCEED THEN LET US CONSIDER THOSE MUSCLES IN THEIR ORDER WHICH CHIEFLY SERVE TO FORM AND MOVE THE SKIN OF THE FACE OR CHANGE THE COUNTENANCE WHICH ARE THOSE OF THE FOREHEAD EYELIDS EYES NOSE LIPS AND CHEEKS VI TO THESE I SHALL CONFINE THIS LECTURE AND TO CER TAIN REMARKS AND OBSERVATIONS UPON THEIR ACTIONS HAVING REGARD ALL ALONG TO THOSE AUTHORS THAT WERE MOST EXACT AND ACCURATE IN THEIR RESEARCHES AND DIS COVERIES OF THE TRUE STRUCTURE OF MUSCLES BUT BE FORE I BEGIN MY DESCRIPTION I CANNOT BUT PARTICULARLY B 2 MENTION4 MENTION IN THIS PLACE WITH THE GREATEST REVERENCE THAT INDEFATIGABLE ANATOMIST THE LATE DOCTOR JAMES DOUGLAS WHOSE TREATISE OF THE MUSCLES I FIND WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE FAMOUS ANATOMICAL CRITIC  SAN TORINI OR HE COULD NOT HAVE QUOTED BESIDES EUSTA CHIUS TWO MORE MODERN AUTHORS FOR THE DISCOVERY OF THE MUSCLE CALLED THE COCCYGAEUS NEITHER OF WHOM COULD EVER HAVE KNOWN THIS VERY NAME IF DR DOU GLAS HAD NOT INVENTED IT WHEN HE DISCOVERD THE MUSCLE WHICH HE CALLD SO SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME BEFORE HE PUBLISHD HIS MYOGRAPHIAE COMPARATAE SPECI MEN WHICH THE WORLD WAS FAVOURED WITH IN THE YEAR 1707 VII NOW ALTHOUGH THE FIRST DISCOVERY OF THIS MUSCLE HAS BEEN GIVEN TO EUSTACHIUS BECAUSE SOMETHING LIKE IT IS SEEN UPON A BACK VIEW OF ONE OF HIS FIGURES YET SUPPOSING THAT AUTHORS FIGURES RIGHT AS TO THIS POINT OUR DR DOUGLAS IS ABSOLUTELY AS CERTAINLY AN ORIGINAL DISCOVERER OF THIS MUSCLE AS EUSTACHIUS BECAUSE THE PLATES OF THE LATTER WERE CONCEALED FROM THE  SANTORINI IN HIS OBSERVATIONES ANATOMICAE HAS THESE WORDS  QUAMVIS POSTREMAE LEVATORIS FIBRAE TRIANGULARI ILLI MUSCULO ADSTENT  QUI  AB EUSTACHIO EXHIBITUS DEINDE AB CLAR CHESELDENO ET  MORGAGNO TUM RETRAHENDO ET LEVANDO COCCYGI TUM IIS PARTIBUS FIR  MANDIS TRIBUITUR ETC HE ALSO SEEMS NOT TO KNOW WHAT LANCISIUS MENTIONS IN HIS LETTER TO DR FANTONUS THAT MORGAGNI WAS INVITED TO ASSIST IN THE EXPLANATION OF EUSTACHIUSS TABLES AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT HE WAS THE LESS LIKELY AT THAT TIME TO HAVE ANY SHARE IN THE DISCO VERY OF THAT MUSCLE WHICH NO DOUBT APPEARS ON A BACK VIEW OF A MUSCULAR BODY IN THAT AUTHORS 36TH TABLE AT THE TIME OF LANCISIUSS BEING EMPLOYD TO EXPLAIN THEM OF WHICH MORE HEREAFTER5 THE WORLD TILL ABOUT FIVE YEARS AFTER DR DOUGLASS BOOK CAME OUT AND EVEN WHEN THEY WERE FOUND THEY HAD NO EXPLANATION TILL LANCISIUS FIRST EXPLAIND THEM IN THE YEAR 1712 WHO NOTWITHSTANDING NEVER TOOK ANY NOTICE OF THE COCCYGAEUS MUSCLE IN HIS EX PLANATIONS ALTHOUGH WE MAY AFFIRM MORGAGNI AS SISTED IN THEM FOR LANCISIUS AFTER HE HAD BEEN ORDERD BY THE POPE TO PUBLISH HIS EXPLANATIONS WROTE LETTERS TO ONE FANTONUS AND TO MORGAGNI BOTH PHYSICIANS AND PROFESSORS OF ANATOMY SETTING FORTH THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TASK AND REQUIRING THEIR OPINIONS AND ASSISTANCE IN ALTERING WHATEVER THEY MIGHT SEE AMISS IN WHAT HE HAD DONE HE RECEIVED ANSWERS FROM BOTH AND IN THAT OF MORGAGNI A PAR TICULAR RECAPITULATION OF SOME PART OR OTHER OF THE FI GURE OF EVERY TABLE EXCEPT THAT OF THE XXXVI PLATE WHICH ALONE CONTAINS THIS MUSCLE IN QUESTION BUT AFTERWARDS HE TELLS US IN HIS ADVERSARIA WHICH WERE PRINTED AS LATE AS THE YEAR 1719 THAT HE DIS COVERD IT HIMSELF AND CALLS IT MUSCULUS COCCYGIS LEVATOR SEE THE END OF HIS 45TH ANIMADVERSION FOR BEFORE THIS NEITHER LANCISIUS FANTONUS NOR MORGAGNI TOOK NOTICE OF IT WHEREAS DRDOUGLAS NOT ONLY DISCOVERD THE MUSCLE AND DEMONSTRATED IT TO THE STUDENTS WHO ATTENDED HIS LECTURES BUT ALSO INVENTED THE NAME FOR IT SO MANY YEARS AS I HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE EUSTACHIUSS PLATES WERE FOUND IT WOULD HAVE BEEN AN UNGENEROUS OMISSION TO HAVE NEGLECTED SETTING THIS PART OF ANATOMICAL HISTORY RIGHT SINCE I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH HIS GREAT ABILITIES IN THIS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF LEARNING IN HIS LIFETIME AND PARTICULARLY SINCE I FIND A FOREIGN AUTHOR OF SO MUCH CREDIT AS SANTORINI VERY MUCH MISTAKEN6 MISTAKEN IN THE MATTER AND A DOMESTIC AUTHOR OF NO LESS NOTE THE INGENIOUS PROFESSOR MONRO CALLING IT THE COCCYGAEUS OF DOUGLAS OR RATHER OF EUSTA CHIUS WHO THOUGH HE MIGHT HAVE SEEN THE MUSCLE WE MIGHT BE SURE NEVER DREAMED OF THE NAME AND CONSEQUENTLY WE HAVE AS MUCH REASON TO ASCRIBE THE DISCOVERY OF THE COCCYGAEUS TO DOUGLAS AS TO EUSTACHIUS IF NOT MORE HAVING NOW THE SATIS FACTION OF GIVING DUE HONOUR TO THE MEMORY OF THAT ABLE ANATOMIST WHO WAS SO WORTHY A MEMBER OF THIS LEARNED SOCIETY I RETURN TO MY PRESENT PUR POSE AND FIRST OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREHEAD VIII OF THE FRONTAL MUSCLE THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES AMONGST ANATOMISTS CONCERNING THIS MUSCLE AND THE SUBSEQUENT BUT FROM THE ACCURACY OF THE DISSECTIONS OF DR DOUGLAS AND MY OWN OBSERVATIONS THERE IS NO BETTER DE SCRIPTION CAN BE EXHIBITED THAN HIS WHOSE BOOK I WAS INTIRELY LED BY DURING MY DISSECTIONS IN MYO LOGY WHICH WAS ALWAYS STRONGLY RECOMMENDED BY THE ANATOMISTS I FOLLOWED AS THE SUREST GUIDE DURING MY STUDIES AND WHICH I SHALL NOW CHIEFLY FOLLOW AS TO THE DESCRIPTIONS AND USES OF THE MUSCLES IN QUESTION EXCEPT WHERE ANY NEW OBSERVATION MAY PERHAPS MAKE AN ALTERATION IX THE TRUE FRONTAL MUSCLE ARISES FLESHY FROM THE PROCESS OF THE OS FRONTIS NEXT THE INNER OR GREAT ANGLE7 ANGLE OF THE ORBIT ABOVE THE JOINING OF THE OS NASI AND SUPERIOR PROCESS OF THE OS MAXILLARE WITH THIS BONE FROM THENCE IT RUNS OBLIQUELY OUTWARDS AND UPWARDS AND IS INSERTED INTO THE FLESHY PART OF THE SUBSEQUENT MUSCLE SOME OF ITS FIBRILLAE PASSING THROUGH INTO THE SKIN A LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE MIDDLE REGION OF THE EYEBROWS ITS USE IS TO SMOOTH THE FOREHEAD BY PULLING IT DOWN AFTER IT HAS BEEN WRINKLED BY THE ACTION OF THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS AND WHEN IT ACTS MORE FORCIBLY IT SERVES TO WRINKLE THE SKIN OF THE FOREHEAD BETWEEN THE EYEBROWS AS IT HAPPENS WHEN WE FROWN OR KNIT THEM X OF THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS THIS MUSCLE ARISES FLESHY FROM THE TRANSVERSE LINE OF THE OCCIPUT OPPOSITE TO PART OF THE SUPERIOR TERMINATION OF THE MASTOIDAEUS AND PART OF THE BE GINNING OF THE TRAPEZIUS NEXT IT AND THEN TENDINOUS FROM THE REST OF THAT LINE BACKWARDS ARISING AFTER THE SAME MANNER ON THE OTHER SIDE FROM THENCE IT GOES STRAIT UP AND SOON BECOMING ALL TENDINOUS IT COVERS THE PARIETAL BONES AND THE OSSA SQUAMOSA ABOVE THE TEMPORAL MUSCLES ITS OUTER EDGE BEING FASTEND TO THE OS JUGALE ON EACH SIDE XI THIS BROAD TENDON NEAR THE CORONAL SUTURE GROWS FLESHY AND DESCENDS WITH STREIGHT FIBRES AS LOW AS THE MUSCULI ORBICULARES AND ENDS IN THE SKIN AT THE EYEBROWS XII8 XII THIS MUSCLE SENDS OFF FROM ITS LOWER PART BETWEEN THE EYES A NARROW MUSCLE WHICH DR DOUGLAS CALLS AN ELONGATION THAT PASSES OVER THE BONES OF THE NOSE AS FAR DOWNWARD AS THE END OF THE CARTILAGI NOUS PART WHERE ITS FIBRES RUN OFF ON EACH SIDE AND END IN THE SKIN ABOVE THE MUSCULUS NASI PROPRIUS THE OFFICE OF THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS IS TO PULL THE SKIN OF THE HEAD BACKWARD DRAWING UP THE EYE BROWS WHEREBY THE SKIN OF THE FOREHEAD IS WRINKLED THE POWER OF MOVING THIS MUSCLE IS MUCH GREATER IN SOME THAN IN OTHERS SO AS TO BE ABLE TO SHAKE OFF THEIR CAPS AND THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE MUSCLES OF THE OUTER EAR FOR NATURE DESIGND STRONG MOTIONS TO ALL THESE PARTS IF THE MANNER OF BINDING UP IN FANTS HEADS DID NOT DEPRIVE THEM OF THEIR NATURAL ACTIONS SO AS TO LEAVE THEM IN ALMOST PARALYTIC STATE XIII OBSERVATION ALTHOUGH THE OCCIPITAL AND FRONTAL PORTIONS OF THE LAST DESCRIBED MUSCLE ARE BY MR COWPER ACCOUNTED A CONTINUATION OF EACH OTHER YET HE CONFESSES HE FOL LOWS THE CUSTOM OF OTHER AUTHORS BY CALLING THE FORE PART THE FRONTAL MUSCLE AND GIVING THE NAME OCCIPITO FRONTALIS TO THE POSTERIOR PORTION ONLY CON TINUING THE TWO NAMES IN ORDER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO AVOID INNOVATION WHEREBY HE MAKES SOME CONFUSION OF NAMES HOWEVER ALTHOUGH THEY ARE REALLY BUT ONE9 ONE MUSCLE ONLY HAVING ONE OF ITS FLESHY PARTS FOR WARDS AND THE OTHER BACKWARDS I SEE NO REASON WHY THEY MIGHT NOT HAVE THEIR APPELLATIONS CONTINUED FROM THEIR SITUATIONS WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY THAT IN STEAD OF ACCOUNTING THEM SEPARATE MUSCLES THEY SHOULD BE ONLY PROPERLY SPEAKING THE FRONTAL AND OCCIPITAL PORTIONS OF THE SAME MUSCLE AND INDEED THAT ACCURATE ANATOMIST DR JAMES DOUGLAS HAS JUSTLY CALLD THEM THE OCCIPITO FRONTALIS AS ONE DI GASTRIC MUSCLE HAVING A BELLY OF FLESHY FIBRES BEFORE AND BEHIND AND SEPARATELY DESCRIBED THE TRUE FRONTAL MUSCLE HAVING ITS ORIGINATION FROM THE PROCESS OF THE OS FRONTIS MENTIOND BEFORE AND TERMINATING IN THE ANTERIOR FLESHY PART OF THE FORMER XIV AND ALTHOUGH THIS FRONTAL MUSCLE OR CORRUGATOR OF COITER WHO FIRST DISCOVERD IT IS THE SAME THAT COWPER CALLS THE INTERNAL FLESHY PRODUCTION ONLY OF THE FRONTAL YET COWPER DECLARES HE SEES NO REASON TO MAKE THEM DISTINCT MUSCLES WHICH I OWN SURPRISES ME SINCE THEIR FIBRES HAVE A DIFFERENT DIRECTION AND OFFICE FROM THE ANTERIOR FLESHY PART OF THE OCCIPITO FRONTALIS XV AS TO THE ACTIONS OF THE TRUE FRONTAL OR CORRU GATOR COITERI I MUST DISSENT FROM ALL AUTHORS IN ONE PARTICULAR IT IS SAID THAT THIS MUSCLE SERVES TO PULL DOWN THE SKIN OF THE FOREHEAD AFTER IT HAS BEEN WRINKLED NOW LET ANY ONE BY MOVING THE OC CIPITO FRONTALIS PULL UP THE EYEBROWS AND WRINKLE C THE10 THE FOREHEAD THE RESTITUTION OF IT WILL APPEAR TO HIM AS IT DOES TO ME TO BE SPONTANEOUS IMME DIATELY UPON THE REMISSION ONLY OF THE ACTION OF THE OCCIPITO FRONTALIS WHEREAS THE TRUE FRONTAL MUSCLE OF COITER AND DOUGLAS CAN ACT NO OTHERWISE THAN IN DRAWING TOGETHER THE EYEBROWS DOWNWARDS AND INWARDS AS IN FROWNING FOR THE FIBRES OF THIS MUSCLE ARE DIRECTED FROM THEIR ORIGINATIONS OBLIQUELY UPWARDS AND OUTWARDS AND CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THEY ARE CONTRACTED THEY CAN HAVE NO OTHER MOTION TOWARDS THEIR ORIGINATION THAN IN THE OBLIQUE DIREC TION JUST MENTIONED FOR THEIR ACTION IS SUCCESSIVE TO THE SPONTANEOUS RESTITUTION OF THE SKIN OF THE FOREHEAD AFTER BEING WRINKLED XVI OF THE MUSCLES OF THE EYELIDS THE EYELIDS HAVE ONLY TWO PAIR OF MUSCLES AMONGST AUTHORS THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM RECTUS AND THE ORBICULARIS PALPEBRARUM THE FOR MER OF WHICH BEING PROPER TO THE UPPER LID AND THE LATTER BEING COMMON TO BOTH UPPER AND UNDER WAS THE REASON OF THESE DISTINCT NAMES BUT TO THESE I SHALL NOW TAKE THE LIBERTY TO ADD A THIRD PAIR AND CALL EACH THE OCCLUDENS PALPEBRAM WHICH CONSISTS OF THOSE FIBRES THAT COVER THE UPPER LID DISTINGUISHD FROM THOSE OF THE ORBICULARIS BOTH IN SITUATION AND OFFICE AS EXPLAIND IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION AND AS TO FIBRES OF THE UNDER LIDS THEY ARE INCON SIDERABLE SERVING FOR NO OTHER USE THAT I KNOW OF BUT11 BUT TO RENDER THEM OF A SUFFICIENT THICKNESS TO MATCH THE EDGES OF THE UPPER EYELIDS WHEN THEY PASS OVER THE EYE AND COME INTO CONTACT WITH THEM SANTORINI DISTINGUISHD INDEED THE FIBRES UPON THE LIDS FROM THE CIRCULAR FIBRES OF THE ORBICULARIS BUT SAYS THEIR MOTION OR ACTION IS AT THE SAME INSTANT WHICH MISTAKE WE SHALL RECTIFY IN THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATION HE ALSO MAKES THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS RUN DOWNWARDS OVER PART OF THE ORBICULARIS AND SINK INTO IT ABOUT THE SUPERCILIA BLENDING WITH EACH OTHER BETWEEN THE INNER CANTHUS AND THE NOSE XVII THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM RECTUS ARISES NARROW FROM THE UPPER PART OF THE HOLE OF THE SPHAENOIDAL BONE THRO WHICH THE OPTIC NERVE PASSES BETWEEN THE ORIGINA TIONS OF TWO OF THE MUSCLES OF THE EYES VIZ THE ATTOLLENS AND THE OBLIQUUS MAJOR AND ENDS BROAD AND TENDINOUS IN THE EDGE OF THE UPPER LID AND SERVES TO DRAW IT UP WHEREBY THE EYE IS OPEND THIS WITH A LITTLE PORTION BY SOME CALLD THE CILIARIS ARE HID UNDER THE ORBICULARIS AND THERE FORE I HAVE REPRESENTED IT IN THIS DRAWING OF A PRE PARATION MADE ON PURPOSE OF ALL THESE MUSCLES TO GETHER IN TWO DIFFERENT VIEWS WHICH WILL GIVE A JUST IDEA OF THEIR STRUCTURES AND ACTIONS SEE TAB I FIG 2 AND 3 C 2 XVIII12 XVIII THE ORBICULARIS  ARISES TENDINOUS AND FLESHY FROM THE EDGE OF THE OS MAXILLARE THAT MAKES THE LOWER PART OF THE ORBIT AT THE INNER ANGLE OF THE EYE ITS FIBRES ARE SPREAD UPON THE UNDER LID AND A GREAT PART OF THE OS MALI AND RUNNING ROUND THE LITTLE CANTHUS THEY ARE CONTINUED AUTHORS SAY OVER THE UPPER LID AND UPPER PART OF THE ORBIT AT THE GREAT ANGLE ADHERING TO PART OF THE OS FRONTIS AND SUPE RIOR PROCESS OF THE OS MAXILLARE THIS MUSCLE SAY THEY DRAWS THE TWO CILIARY EDGES TOGETHER AND SHUTS UP THE EYE XIX OBSERVATION IT IS NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO CONCEIVE HOW THE EYE LID IS OPENED BECAUSE THERE IS A FIXED POINT TO WHICH IT IS DRAWN BACK BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM FOR ALTHO THE ORIGINATION OF THIS MUS CLE IS RATHER BEHIND THE EYE THAN ABOVE IT AS BEING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORBIT YET THE END OF PULLING UP THE LID IS ANSWERD SINCE THE BALL OF THE EYE SERVES ITS TENDINOUS EXPANSION AS A LEVER OR PULLEY WHILST THE FLESHY FIBRES BEHIND ARE CONTRACTED TO FA VOUR ITS ASCENT AS WELL AS IF ITS ORIGINATION WAS IN A RIGHT  MOST AUTHORS AND PARTICULARLY COWPER AND DOUGLAS MAKE THIS MUSCLE BUT ONE CIRCULAR MUSCLE BUT SPIGEL AND RIOLAN DIVIDE IT INTO TWO THE UPPER AND UNDER AND GIVE THEM ATTACHMENTS AT EITHER ANGLE OF THE ORBIT TO WHICH DIEMERBROECK SUBSCRIBES13 RIGHT LINE OVER IT FROM THE FRONTAL BONE BUT THE MOTION OF THE ORBICULARIS WHICH IS OFTEN COMPARED TO A SPHINCTER IS MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND AND YET SLIGHTLY PASSD BY WITHOUT ANY NOTICE MR COW PER ONLY SAYS THIS MUSCLE ACTING LIKE THE SPHINCTERS OF OTHER PARTS CONSTRINGES THE EYELIDS AND THIS SEEMS THE GENERAL NOTION OF ALL ANATOMISTS LET US HOWEVER ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THIS MOST WISE CONTRIVANCE FOR THE MOTION OF THE EYELIDS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER XX WE MAY VERY SECURELY AFFIRM THAT THERE IS NO ANA LOGY BETWEEN A SPHINCTER AND THE PALPEBRAM OCCLU DENS FOR SO WE SHALL VENTURE TO CALL IT FOR THE FUTURE FOR ALTHO THERE IS AN APPEARANCE OF A CIRCULAR DI RECTION OF THE FIBRES ABOVE AND BELOW THE EYELIDS IN THE EXPANDED PART OR ORBICULARIS YET THE FIBRES UPON THE EYELIDS THEMSELVES HAVE NO SUCH APPEAR ANCE THEY HAVE ATTACHMENTS TO THE CANTHUS ON EACH SIDE AND THE DIRECTION OF THEIR MUSCULAR FIBRES IS IN SOME MEASURE PARALLEL TO THE LIDS THO UP WARDS SOMEWHAT CURVED OTHERWISE THE UPPER LID WOULD NOT BE CAPABLE OF SHUTTING DOWN UPON THE UNDER FOR IT IS THIS LID ALONE THAT IS LIFTED UP FROM THE UNDER THE LATTER HAVING NO NEED OF A MUSCLE TO DRAW IT DOWN BUT IS NATURALLY CONFINED BELOW THE CONVEXITY OF THE GLOBE OF THE EYE AND IS NEVER CA PABLE OF PASSING UP EVEN TO THE EQUATORIAL POINT WITH ITS CILIARY EDGE WHEREAS ANY ONE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE CILIARY EDGE OF THE UPPER LID IN SHUTTING THE EYE IS CARRIED DOWN FAR BELOW THAT POINT AND STRAITNING ITSELF BELOW THE CONVEXITY FORMS A PERFECT CONCAVE14 CONCAVE CAP OVER THE GLOBE WHEN IT MEETS THE UNDER LID WHICH IN FULLEYD PEOPLE IS VERY CONSPICUOUS AND WELL WORTH OBSERVING THE MANNER OF THE UPPER LIDS BEING DRAWN DOWN IS THIS XXI THE TWO FIXED POINTS OF THE CILIARY EDGES ARE A CON SIDERABLE WAY BELOW AND PARALLEL TO THE EQUATOR OF THE GLOBE OF THE EYE CONSEQUENTLY WHEN THE MUS CULAR FIBRES OF THE UPPER LID WHICH WHILST OPEN FORM CURVES OF A CERTAIN DIMENSION CONTRACT THEM SELVES THEY WILL ENDEAVOUR TO FORM STRAIT LINES BY BEING SHORTENED THIS TENDENCY TO BECOME STRAIT WILL FORCE EACH CILIARY EDGE OVER AND BEYOND THE EQUATOR EVEN TO FORM AN INVERTED ARCH BELOW IT FOR WHEN ONCE IT IS FORCED OVER THE GLOBE THUS FAR IT WILL NATURALLY PASS A LITTLE FURTHER SINCE THE CON VEXITY DIMINISHES BEFORE IT ALL ALONG TO ITS UTMOST CONTRACTION SEE TAB I FIG 4 XXII I HAVE BEEN THUS WILLING TO EXPLAIN THE MANNER OF THE OCCLUSION OF THE EYE WHICH I HOPE IS CLEAR TO YOU GENTLEMEN FIRST BECAUSE SANTORINI IN HIS FIGURE OF THE FACE MAKES THE EYELIDS MEET UPON THE VERY EQUATOR OF THE EYEBALL AND OTHERS SEEM TO THINK THAT THE UPPER EYELID MOVES NOT MUCH MORE THAN THE UNDER AND SECONDLY TO SHEW HOW WIDELY DIFFERENT THE MUSCULAR FIBRES OF THE LIDS ARE IN THEIR SITUATION AND ACTION FROM THOSE OF A SPHINCTER WHICH IS COWPERS OPINION WHOSE OFFICE IS TO PURSE UP ANY PART ROUND WHICH THEY ARE PLACED AS15 AS THE MOUTH BLADDER ETC WHEN THEY ACT WITHOUT RESTRAINT AND THEREFORE SINCE THOSE CIRCULAR FIBRES WHICH ALONE ARE TO BE CALLD THE ORBICULARIS CAN ONLY ACT BY PURSING THEMSELVES UP ROUND THEY HAVE NO SHARE IN SHUTTING THE EYE WHICH IS DONE BY THE BRINGING DOWN OF THE UPPER LID ALONE AS I HAVE SAID ALREADY AND CONSEQUENTLY ONLY SERVE TO DRAW TO GETHER THE SKIN OF THE FACE ALL ROUND CLOSING UP THE EYE WITH MORE VIOLENCE AND AT THE SAME TIME DIS TORTING THE FACE FOR THE EYELIDS ARE NATURALLY SHUT DOWN WITHOUT THE LEAST DISCOMPOSURE OF THE COUN TENANCE WHEREAS THIS MOTION OF THE ORBICULARIS IS ONE OF THE EXPRESSIONS OF PAIN AND ANGUISH OR USED TO DEFEND THE EYES FROM DUST OR THE GLARING RAYS OF THE SUN WHEN THE EYES ARE WEAK XXIII ANOTHER SHORT OBSERVATION WORTHY OF NOTE IS THAT NO ONE CAN LIFT UP THE EYELIDS TO THEIR UTMOST HEIGHT WITHOUT LOOKING UPWARDS THAT IS WITHOUT RAISING UP THE PUPIL OF THE EYE AT THE SAME TIME EXCEPT A PARTICULAR PASSION URGES THE CONTRARY BECAUSE THE MUSCLE WHICH LIFTS UP THE LID WHEN THERE IS AN INTENT TO RAISE IT VERY HIGH DRAWS THE MUSCULUS AT TOLLENS OR ELEVATOR OF THE EYE INTO CONSENT AND MAKES IT ACT TOO FOR THEY BOTH ARISE FROM POINTS THAT ARE VERY NEAR EACH OTHER AND THE APERIENS PAL PEBRAM LIES UPON THE ATTOLLENS OR ELEVATOR OF THE EYE IN ITS WHOLE LENGTH AND THIS CONSENT BE TWEEN THEM IS RECIPROCAL THE SOLE REASON FOR IT BE ING THAT WHEN THERE IS A NECESSITY OF LOOKING UP AT AN OBJECT THE LID SHOULD BE PULLD UP OUT OF THE WAY XXIII16 XXIV NOW NOTWITHSTANDING THIS WISE CONTRIVANCE THAT APPEARS IN THE CONSENT OF THESE MUSCLES UPON OPEN ING THE EYE THERE IS A CIRCUMSTANCE WHEREIN THE ELEVATOR OF THE EYE ACTS IN PULLING THE PUPIL UPWARDS WHEN THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM DOES NOT ACT AT ALL BUT CONTINUES SHUT AND THAT IS WHEN ONE SHUTS THE LIDS IN ORDER TO SLEEP FOR IN THAT CASE THE PUPIL IS TURNED UP AS IF NATURE INTENDED THAT WHILST THE UPPER LID IS DRAWN DOWN THE PUPIL SHOULD BE INTI MATELY COVERED BY BEING TURNED UP UNDER IT LEST ANY RAYS OF LIGHT MIGHT STIMULATE THE EYES AND IMPEDE THE SWEET REFRESHMENT WHICH IS SO NECESSARY AFTER BUSINESS AND FATIGUE THIS IS THE CASE WITH ALL WHO SLEEP WITH THEIR LIDS CLOSE AND AS TO THOSE WHO SLEEP WITH THEM OPEN IT IS VERY APPARENT IN THEM FOR WHOSOEVER TAKES NOTICE OF SUCH WHILE THEY SLEEP WILL FIND THAT NOTHING IS SEEN BUT THE WHITE OF THE EYE AND UPON AWAKING THEM WILL EASILY SEE THE PUPIL TURNING DOWN AS THE LIDS OPEN XXV MUSCLES OF THE EYES THE EYES HAVE SIX PAIR OF MUSCLES THREE PAIR TO EACH WHICH ARE THE ELEVATOR DEPRESSOR AD DUCTOR ABDUCTOR OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR OBLIQUUS INFERIOR WHICH ALTHO THEY CANNOT BE SAID TO CONTRIBUTE AUGHT TO THE FORMATION OR GESTURE OF THE FACE YET THEY HAVE NO SMALL SHARE IN THE EXPRESSION OF THE PASSIONS OF17 OF THE MIND UPON THE COUNTENANCE BY THE DIFFERENT MOTIONS THEY GIVE THE EYES IN CONSENT WITH THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE UPON PARTICULAR OCCASIONS XXV THE ELEVATOR ARISES TENDINOUS AND FLESHY FROM THE EDGE OF THE FORAMEN LACERUM NEAR THE ABDUCTOR TERMINATES INTO THE UPPER AND FORE PART OF THE TUNICA SCLEROTIS OF THE EYE BY A THIN TENDON AND SERVES TO RAISE UP THE GLOBE OF THE EYE XXVI THE DEPRESSOR ARISES TENDINOUS AND FLESHY FROM THE LOWER EDGE OF THE HOLE THAT GIVES PASSAGE TO THE OPTIC NERVE IS INSERTED BY A THIN TENDON INTO THE SAME COAT OPPOSITE TO THE FORMER AND SERVES TO DRAW DOWN THE GLOBE OF THE EYE XXVII THE ADDUCTOR ARISES TENDINOUS AND FLESHY FROM THE EDGE OF THE HOLE OF THE OPTIC NERVE BETWEEN THE OBLIQUUS MAJOR AND THE HUMILIS ENDS IN THE SAME COAT TOWARDS THE NOSE BY A THIN TENDON AND PULLS THE GLOBE OF THE EYE THAT WAY XXVIII THE ABDUCTOR SPRINGS FROM THE FORAMEN LACERUM WITHOUT THE ORBIT OF THE EYE AND IS INSERTED INTO THE SAME COAT CALLED SCLEROTIS AGAINST THE FORMER WHOSE OFFICE IS TO DRAW THE EYE FROM THE NOSE D XXIX18 XXIX THE OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR HAS ITS RISE FROM THE EDGE OF THE HOLE THROUGH WHICH THE OPTIC NERVE PASSES BETWEEN THE ELEVATOR AND ADDUCTOR RUNS ALONG THE OS PLANUM UPWARDS PASSING THRO THE TROCHLEA A LIT TLE PULLY FIXED TO THE FRONTAL BONE AND DOUBLING DOWNWARDS AGAIN IS FIXED BY A THIN TENDON INTO THE SAME COAT BEHIND THE TENDINOUS EXPANSION OF THE ELEVATOR WHOSE OFFICE IS TO INCLINE THE EYE FOR WARDS WITH ITS PUPIL DOWNWARDS XXX THE OBLIQUUS INFERIOR ARISES TENDINOUS FROM THE EDGE OF THE ORBIT WHERE THE OS MAXILLARE JOINS THE OS MALI AND ENDS BACKWARDS AND INWARDS BETWEEN THE OPTIC NERVE AND THE TENDON OF THE ABDUCTOR DRAWING THE EYE FORWARDS AND INCLINING THE PUPIL UPWARDS XXXI O B S E R V A T I O N ALTHO THE EYE IS SAID IN OUR DESCRIPTION TO BE DRAWN THIS OR THAT WAY AND IT IS INDEED THE LANGUAGE OF ALL ANATOMISTS ACCORDING AS THE MUSCLE ACTS YET STRICTLY SPEAKING IT IS ONLY TURNED OR ROLLED THIS OR THAT WAY AS A MOVEABLE BALL IN A SOCKET BY WHICH MOTION IT IS THE PUPIL ALONE THAT CAN BE SAID TO CHANGE ITS PLACE AS A SPOT UPON A GLOBE WHOSE SITUATION IS ALTERD BY THE MOTION OF SUCH A BODY ROUND ITS AXIS SO THAT SINCE THE EYE IS MOVED ONLY FOR THE SAKE OF VISION WHEN THE ELEVATOR FOR EXAMPLE IS CONTRACTED BY DRAWING THE PLACE OF THE GLOBE19 GLOBE TO WHICH IT IS ATTACHED BACKWARDS ITS SPOT OR PUPIL TURNS UPWARDS AND AGAIN WHEN THE DE PRESSOR IS CONTRACTED BY DRAWING ITS FIXED POINT BACK WARDS THE PUPIL IS TURNED DOWNWARDS THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THE OTHER MUSCLES THAT MOVE THE EYE FOR AS THE FOUR FIRST HAVE THEIR RISE VERY NEAR ONE ANOTHER THE EYE WITH THESE FOUR MUSCLES IN THEIR NATURAL SITUATION MAKE THE FIGURE OF A CONE WHOSE BASIS IS FORWARDS AND THEAPEX BACKWARDS AND THERE FORE EACH WHEN IT IS RESPECTIVELY CONTRACTED MUST NECESSARILY PULL THE PLACE OF ITS ATTACHMENT BACK WARDS AND SO MOVE THE PUPIL UPWARDS DOWNWARDS TO THE NOSE OR FROM IT AND THE BUSINESS OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES IS THE SAME EXCEPT WHAT REGARDS THE POINTS OF THEIR VELLICATION WHEREBY THEY ARE PULLED IN AN OBLIQUE DIRECTION TO THE FOUR STRAIT MOTIONS MENTIONED ABOVE XXXII THE EYES ARE CAPABLE OF A ROTATORY MOTION WHICH AUTHORS HAVE ASCRIBED TO THE POWER OF THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES BUT EVERY OTHER MUSCLES OF THE EYE CONTRIBUTES TO ITS ROTATION AS WELL AS THESE WHICH OF THEMSELVES CAN DO NO MORE THAN THE OFFICE AS SIGNED THEM IN THE ABOVE DESCRIPTION BUT THAT MOTION IS THUS PERFORMD LET ANY ONE LOOK UP WARDS AT THE CENTRE OF AN HORIZONTAL LINE ON A WALL OF SEVERAL FEET LONG HE WILL HAVE IT IN HIS POWER TO CARRY HIS VIEW ALONG THAT LINE TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT TO EITHER EXTREMITY WITHOUT MOVING HIS HEAD NOW THE ELEVATOR OF EACH EYE ELEVATES THE PUPIL TO THE CENTRAL POINT OF VISION MENTIOND D 2 BUT20 BUT THE QUESTION IS HOW THE PUPILS ARE CARRIED TO THE EXTREMITIES OF THE LINE TO ANSWER THIS LET US CONSIDER THE STATE OF THE MUSCLES THE TENDINOUS AT TACHMENTS OF THE FOUR STRAIT MUSCLES ARE BROAD AND THIN WHERE THEY ARE FIXED TO THE SCLEROTIS SO THAT THE EDGE OF ONE EXPANSION IS VERY NEAR THAT OF THE OTHER ALL ROUND THE GLOBE AND THE FLESHY FIBRES FROM THEM ALSO ARE DISPOSED IN A THIN FLAT ORDER BACK WARDS UNTIL THEY APPROACH THE BONES FROM WHENCE THEY ARISE WHERE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THEIR AT TACHMENT THEY ARE SQUEEZD CLOSER TOGETHER THAN WHEN THEY FIRST QUIT THE GLOBE FROM THIS POSITION THEY MAY BE SAID TO FORM A HOLLOW CONE HAVING THE OPTIC NERVE AS THEIR AXIS SEE T A B II FIG 2 A XXXIII NOW SUPPOSE THE SIGHT FIXED TO THE MIDDLE OF THAT LINE ABOVE MENTIOND BY THE ELEVATOR OF EACH EYE AND IT WAS RESOLVD TO CARRY IT ALONG THE LINE TO THE RIGHT THEN THE FIBRES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE ELE VATOR OF EACH EYE WOULD REMIT THEIR ACTIONS AND THOSE OF THE RIGHT SIDE OF EACH MUSCLE CONTRACT MORE STRONGLY UNTIL THEY ARE SUCCEEDED AND ASSISTED BY AS MANY OF THE NEIGHBOURING FIBRES OF THE ABDUCTOR OF THE RIGHT EYE AND THE ADDUCTOR OF THE LEFT AS WILL SERVE TO MAINTAIN THE VIEW ALL ALONG THE LINE TO THE EXTREMITY ON THAT SIDE AND VICE VERSA XXXIV BUT IF A CIRCLE WAS DESCRIBED IN A VERTICAL PLANE AND IT WAS RESOLVED TO CARRY THE SIGHT ALL21 ALL ROUND IT TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT THEN SUPPOSING ONE FOR EXAMPLE BEGINS AT THE TOP AND PROCEEDS TO THE RIGHT EVERY INDIVIDUAL FIBRE SUCCEEDS THE OTHER ON THAT SIDE IN BOTH EYES TILL THE LAST OF THE ONE MUSCLE AS IT WERE DELIVERS OVER ITS OFFICE TO THE NEXT FIBRE OF ITS NEIGHBOURING MUSCLE UNTIL THE ROTATION IS CARRYD ALL ROUND AS OFT AS THE PERSON PLEASETH NOW IN THIS ROTATORY MOTION THE OBLIQUE MUSCLES SEEM TO ME TO HAVE VERY LITTLE SHARE XXXV HENCE IT APPEARS THAT IN MOVING THE PUPIL UP WARDS DOWNWARDS OR TO EITHER SIDE ALL THE FIBRES OF EACH MUSCLE SERVING TO THESE MOTIONS ACT TOGETHER BUT IF ANY OTHER MOTION IS REQUIRED BETWEEN THESE PART OF THE FIBRES OF ONE MAY JOIN AND ASSIST PART OF THOSE OF ITS NEIGHBOURING MUSCLE IN ORDER TO PERFORM IT AND THIS WILL FURTHER APPEAR IF WE DO BUT CONSIDER THAT WHEN FOR EXAMPLE THE OBLIQUUS SUPERIOR OF EITHER EYE ACTS IT SERVES TO INCLINE THE EYE FORWARDS TOWARDS THE NOSE WITH ITS PUPIL DOWNWARDS AND OF CONSEQUENCE THE PUPIL OF THE OTHER EYE MUST BE CARRIED FROM THE NOSE AND DOWNWARDS TOO WHICH CAN BE DONE NO OTHER WAY THAN BY THE COMBINATION OF PART OF THE FIBRES OF THE ABDUCTOR WITH SOME OF THOSE OF THE DE PRESSOR NEXT THEM XXXVI IF WITHOUT MOVING THE HEAD ONE WOULD ENDEA VOUR TO DESCRIBE A CIRCULAR LINE WITH THE PUPILS OF THE22 THE EYES IT CAN SCARCE BE DONE TRULY CIRCULAR BE CAUSE ONE IS APT TO FIX UPON DIFFERENT POINTS SUC CESSIVELY FROM EACH OF WHICH THE EYE MAKES A RIGHT LINE AND THEREFORE WOULD RATHER DESCRIBE A POLYGON THAN A TRUE CIRCLE FROM THE INTERMISSIONS WE ARE APT TO MAKE IN PURSUING SUCH A VIEW BUT IF ONE LOOKS AT THE IMAGES OF HIS EYES IN A MIRROR WITHOUT MOVING HIS HEAD AND THE MIRROR BE MOVED TO DE SCRIBE A CIRCLE THEN THE EYES WILL HAVE A TRUE RO TATION WITHOUT THE LEAST INTERMISSION WHATSOEVER OR IF THE MIRROR BE FIXED AND ONE DESCRIBES A CIRCLE WITH ONES HEAD KEEPING THE EYES FIXED UPON THEIR IMAGE THE SAME WILL HAPPEN XXXVII AUTHORS HAVE GIVEN OTHER NAMES TO THE MUSCLES OF THE EYES BESIDES THESE MENTIONED ABOVE THE ELEVATOR IS CALLED THE SUPERBUS THE DEPRESSOR THE HUMILIS THE ADDUCTOR THE BIBITORIUS THE ABDUCTOR THE INDIGNATORIUS AND THE OBLIQUE MUS CLES ROTATORES AND AMATORII HOW FAR THESE NAMES ARE JUSTLY OR IMPROPERLY APPLIED WILL APPEAR IN OUR EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES WHICH REPRESENT THE PAS SIONS HOWEVER WE SHALL HERE MAKE AN OBSERVATION RELATING TO SHORTSIGHTED EYES AND SUCH AS SQUINT XXXVIII WHEN THE EYES ARE VERY CONVEX THEIR FOCAL DI STANCE IS VERY SHORT AND THEREFORE WHEN THEY VIEW AN OBJECT IT IS PUT TO THE EYES AND GENERALLY HELD ON ONE SIDE FOR BY HOLDING IT THUS THEY CAN HAVE A CLEARER23 A CLEARER SIGHT OF THE OBJECT THAN IF HELD RIGHT BEFORE THEM AT EQUAL DISTANCES FROM BOTH EYES BECAUSE THE ADDUCTOR OF EACH EYE IS VIOLENTLY STRAIND AND CONTRACTED IN ORDER TO DRAW BOTH PUPILS TO THE OBJECT WHICH IS TROUBLESOME AND IT IS ONLY IN THIS CASE THAT THESE TWO MUSCLES ACT TOGETHER AS ANTAGO NISTS TO THE TWO ABDUCTORS AND BRING THEM TO SQUINTING WHEREAS WHEN THE OBJECT IS HELD A LITTLE SIDEWAYS THO THE PUPIL IS BROUGHT NEAR THE NOSE ON ONE SIDE THAT OF THE OTHER WILL BE CARRIED IN SOME MEASURE FROM IT ON THAT SIDE TOWARDS WHICH THE OBJECT IS HELD AND THEREBY THE PROPER MUSCLES WILL ACT TOGETHER THAT IS THE ADDUCTOR ON ONE SIDE WILL ACT IN CONCERT WITH THE ABDUCTOR ON THE OTHER AND VICE VERSA ALTHO NOT SO PERFECTLY AS WHEN THE CONVEXITY OF THE EYES IS MORE NATURAL THE SAME SQUINTING DISTORTION WILL HAPPEN TO ANY ONE WHO PLACES AN OBJECT TOO NEAR HIS NOSE NOW THE REA SON WHY THE PUPILS OF THE EYES MUST FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER IN VIEWING OBJECTS IS BECAUSE THE MIND CAN ATTEND TO NO MORE THAN ONE OBJECT AT A TIME AND SINCE ONE EYE CANNOT DISCERN SO WELL AS BOTH TOGETHER LET THE OBJECT BE PLACED WHERE IT WILL THOSE MUSCLES WHOSE CONTRACTIONS SERVE TO CONDUCT BOTH PUPILS TOWARDS IT ARE ONLY EMPLOYED BY THE WILL AND HENCE IT IS THAT THE ABDUCTORS CAN NE VER BOTH ACT TOGETHER ACCORDING TO THE WILL FOR ONE EYE IN THAT CASE WOULD BE INTIRELY USELESS AND THE ASPECT OF THE PERSON UNNATURAL AND UNSEEMLY BE SIDES ARISTOTLE IN HIS THIRD SECTION AND FIRST PRO BLEM MAKES A QUERY WHY THE EYES ACT TOGETHER AND ANSWERS THAT IT IS BECAUSE THE MOTION OF BOTH HAS ONE AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE WHICH IS SAYS HE THE24 THE CONJUNCTION OF THE OPTIC NERVES GALEN AND MANY AUTHORS SINCE HAD THE SAME WAY OF THINKING BUT HOW STRANGE IT IS TO FIND AUTHORS SEEKING FOR THE CAUSE OF THE UNIFORM MOTIONS OF THE EYES IN THE OPTIC NERVES WHICH EVERY ONE MUST ALLOW SERVE NOT TO PROMOTE ANY MOTION AT ALL NOR HAVE THEY ANY OTHER OFFICE THAN TO PROMOTE VISION ALONE WHEREAS THE EYES ARE MOVED BY THE THIRD PAIR OF NERVES WHICH GO TO THE MUSCLES AND SERVE TO MOVE THEM AND ARE THEREFORE CALLED THE MOTORES OCULORUM WHICH MOVE THEM UNIFORMLY FOR THE PLAIN NATURAL REASON JUST GIVEN AND HOWSOEVER THE UNION OR CONJUNCTION OF THE OPTICS MAY BE OR ANY OTHER CONSTITUTION OF THEM THERE CAN BE NOTHING INTENDED BY SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BUT THE WELFARE AND SECURITY OF THOSE ORGANS WHICH IN EVERY OTHER PART OF NA TURE WE DAILY SEE HAS BEEN THE BENEVOLENT CARE OF OUR G R E A T C R E A T O R BUT FURTHER MANY ARE FOUND TO HAVE NO CONJUNCTION OF THE OPTIC NERVES AND YET HAVE NEITHER SEEN OBJECTS DOUBLE NOR WERE THEIR EYES IRREGULAR IN THEIR MOTIONS XXXIX MUSCLES OF THE NOSE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS AND OTHER PARTS WHICH ARE COMMON TO THE NOSE AND BUT FEW THAT ARE PROPER TO IT THE LATTER ARE THE RINAEUS OR NASALIS OF DOUGLAS OR PINNA RUM DILATATOR PROPRIUS OF SANTORINI WHICH ARISE FLESHY FROM THE EXTREMITY OF THE OS NASI AND TERMI NATE IN THE INTIRE CARTILAGE OF THE ALA NASI SPREAD ING25 ING THEMSELVES OBLIQUELY BACKWARDS THEIR OFFICE IS TO DRAW THE ALA UPWARDS AND BACKWARDS IN ORDER TO DILATE THE NOSTRILS IN WHICH THEY ARE ASSISTED BY THE XL SLIPS OR ELONGATIONS OF THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS WHICH AS IT IS CONTINUED FROM THENCE DOWN THE NOSE AND DIVIDING AT THE MIDDLE TERMINATES ON EACH SIDE PARTLY IN THE AFORESAID MUSCLE AND PARTLY IN THE SKIN ABOVE IT THIS SLIP I TAKE TO BE PROPER TO THE NOSE AND SERVES TO ASSIST THE FORMER IN ITS OFFICE AND ALSO TO WRINKLE THE SKIN OF THE NOSE BY DRAWING ITS LOWER PART UPWARD WHICH HAPPENS IN THE ACT OF DERISION AND IN MANY WHEN THEY LAUGH MUCH BESIDES THIS SANTORINI HAS MENTIOND ANOTHER NEW MUSCLE WHICH HE CALLS MUSCULUS NOVUS TRANS VERSUS WHICH LIKE A SADDLE RIDES CROSS THE LOWER END OF THE BONES OF THE NOSE AND RUNNING OVER THE INSERTIONS OF THE RINAEUS TERMINATE IN THE PYRA MIDALIS ON EACH SIDE THIS MUSCLE IS SO EXCEEDING THIN AS NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED IN EVERY SUBJECT AND AS ITS USE FROM ITS SITUATION CAN BE ONLY TO WRINKLE THE SKIN OF THE NOSE IT MAY WELL BE SPARED SINCE THAT OFFICE IS WELL ENOUGH PERFORMED BY THE ABOVEMEN TIONED MUSCLE AND BY ANOTHER SLIP WHICH IS A COM PANION TO THE PYRAMIDALIS WHOSE FIBRES RUN PARAL LEL TO THE NOSE FROM THE GREAT CANTHUS OF THE EYE AND IS INSERTED INTO THE UPPER LIP AND IN THE ALA NASI ON EACH SIDE E THE26 THE NEXT WE SHALL TAKE NOTICE OF ARE XLI THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS A S THE CHEEKS HAVE NO MOTION OF THEIR OWN BE ING ONLY MOVED IN COMMON WITH SOME ONE OR MORE OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS OR JAWS WE SHALL GIVE OUR DESCRIPTION OF THE BUCCINATOR A PLACE WITH THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS AND AS TO THE FORMATION OF THE CHEEKS THEY CANNOT BE SAID TO BE FORMED OF THE BUCCINATOR OR QUADRATUS GENAE ALONE FOR ALL THOSE THAT MOVE THE LIPS CONTRIBUTE TO IT ALSO AND WHATEVER MOTION THE BUCCINATOR MAY BE SAID TO HAVE IT IS PROPER TO THE LIPS AND MOUTH ALONE AND NOT TO THE CHEEKS  NOW THE MOUTH BEING THE CEN TRAL POINT FROM WHICH ALL THE MUSCLES THAT MOVE THE LIPS AS IT WERE RADIATE THE FIRST THAT OUGHT TO BE DESCRIBED IS THE ORBICULARIS BY SOME CALLED THE OSCULATORIUS AND BY OTHERS THE SPHINCTER LABIORUM BECAUSE WHATSOEVER MUSCLE MOVES OF THOSE ROUND ABOUT IT THE SPONTANEOUS FORM OF THIS IS INEVITABLY ALTERD WE SHALL THEREFORE FIRST DESCRIBE XLII THE ORBICULARIS NOTWITHSTANDING THAT THE NATURAL POSITION OF THE LIPS MAKES NOT A CIRCULAR FORM YET THE FIBRES OF THIS MUSCLE GO ROUND IT HOWEVER THEY CANNOT PRO PERLY BE SAID TO BE ORBICULAR OR BE LIKENED TO A RING27 RING ON ANY ACCOUNT ALTHO THEIR ACTION IS ONLY TO PURSE UP THE MOUTH AS IN WHISTLING AND BLOWING XLIII THE ELEVATOR LABII INFERIORIS PROPRIUS ARISES FROM THE LOWER JAW NEAR THE GUMS OF THE FORE TEETH AND ENDS IN THE SKIN OF THE CHIN WHICH WITH THE LOWER LIP IT DRAWS UPWARDS XLIV THE ELEVATOR LABII SUPERIORIS PROPRIUS ARISES FROM ALL THAT PORTION OF THE OS MAXILLARE THAT MAKES THE LOWER PART OF THE ORBIT ABOVE THE HOLE THAT TRANS MITS THE NERVES AND ARTERIES TO THE CHEEKS AND ENDS IN THE UPPER LIP THIS IS WHAT SANTORINI AND OTHER AUTHORS CALL THE PYRAMIDALIS WHICH SERVES TO PULL THE UPPER LIP UPWARDS ON EACH SIDE XLV THE DEPRESSOR LABII INFERIORIS PROPRIUS ARISES FLESHY FROM THE LOWER PART OF THE CHIN AND IS IN SERTED INTO THE UNDER LIP AND SERVES TO PULL IT DOWN WARDS AND OUTWARDS XLVI THE DEPRESSOR LABII SUPERIORIS PROPRIUS ARISES THIN AND FLESHY FROM THE OS MAXILLARE IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THE GUMS OF THE DENTES INCISIVI AND ENDS IN THE E 2 UPPER28 UPPER LIP PRETTY HIGH UNDER THE NOSE WHICH IT SERVES TO DRAW DOWNWARDS XLVII THE ELEVATOR LABIORUM COMMUNIS ARISES THIN AND FLESHY FROM THE HOLLOW OF THE OS MAXILLARE UNDER THE GREAT HOLE AND ENDS IN THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH SANTORINI CALLS THIS SEU CANINUS EXTRA ORIS RICTUM TERMINATUS ITS USE IS TO BRING THE CORNER OF THE MOUTH UPWARDS ON EACH SIDE XLVIII THE DEPRESSOR LABIORUM COMMUNIS OR TRIANGU LARIS ARISES BROAD AND FLESHY FROM THE LOWER EDGE OF THE LOWER JAW BETWEEN THE LATISSIMUS COLLI AND THE MASSETER IT IS ALSO INSERTED INTO THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH DECUSSATING WITH SOME OF THE FIBRES OF THE FOLLOWING MUSCLE AND SERVES TO PULL DOWN THE COR NERS OF THE MOUTH XLIX THE ZIGOMATICUS MAJOR ARISES FLESHY FROM THE OS MALI NEAR ITS CONJUNCTION WITH THE PROCESS OF THE TEMPORAL BONE RUNS DOWN OBLIQUELY TOWARDS THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH OVER THE INSERTION OF THE SALI VAL DUCT INTO THE BUCCINATOR AND SPREADING JOINS THE END OF THE FORMER MUSCLE ABOUT THE RICTUS ORIS ITS OFFICE IS TO PULL THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH OBLIQUELY UPWARDS L29 L THE ZIGOMATICUS MINOR ARISES FROM THE SAME BONE FORWARDS OF THE FORMER AND ENDS UNDER THE PYRA MIDALIS AND SERVES TO ASSIST IN THE ELEVATION OF THE UPPER LIP LI THE RISORIUS IS A FLAT BUNDLE OF FIBRES WHICH ARISES NEAR THE ANGLE OF THE JAW FROM THE SKIN OVER THE PAROTID GLAND AND IS INSERTED INTO THE UPPER PART OF THE TRIANGULARIS NEAR THE RICTUS ORIS IT LIES BEFORE THE UPPER PART OF THE QUADRATUS GENOE AND SERVES TO DRAW THE ANGLE OF THE MOUTH GENTLY BACKWARDS LII THE BUCCINATOR ARISES FROM TWO DIFFERENT PLACES THAT IS FROM THE MOST REMOTE PART OF THE LOWER JAW BETWEEN THE LAST TOOTH AND THE CORONOID PRO CESS AND FROM BETWEEN THE LAST JAWTOOTH OF THE MAXILLA SUPERIOR AND THE PTERIGOIDAL PROCESS AND RUNNING FORWARDS BROAD IS INSERTED AT THE ANGLE OF THE LIPS INTO THE ORBICULARIS BE HIND THE TRIANGULARIS AND ZIGOMATICUS MAJOR IT SERVES TO SEVERAL PURPOSES FIRST TO SQUECZE AGAINST THE GUMS IN ORDER TO DIRECT THE VICTUALS WHILE WE CHEW BOTH BETWEEN THE TEETH AND THENCE INTO THE CAVITY OF THE MOUTH AND 2DLY TO ASSIST IN FORMING THE FACE FOR LAUGHTER NOW IN30 IN SMILING THE RISORIUS IS SUFFICIENT OF ITSELF BUT WHEN GREAT LAUGHTER IS PROMOTED THE BUCCINATOR TAKES THE WHOLE ACTION TO ITSELF WHICH IS BEGUN BY THE FORMER AND PULLS THE CORNER OF THE MOUTH ON EACH SIDE AND STRETCHES THE LIPS PRODIGIOUSLY AC CORDING TO THE DEGREE OF LAUGHTER REQUIRED LIII OF THE QUADRATUS GENAE OR LATISSIMUS COLLI NOTWITHSTANDING THIS MUSCLE IS NOT AMONG THE MUSCLES OF THE LIPS WE SHALL MENTION IT HERE AS A MUSCLE WHICH BELONGS PARTLY TO THE FACE IT ARISES THIN WITH SOME MEMBRANOUS AND SOME FLESHY FIBRES FROM THE STERNUM OR BREASTBONE THE ACROMION OF THE SCAPULA AND FROM THE INTIRE SPACE BETWEEN THEM OCCUPIED BY THE PECTORAL AND DELTOID MUSCLES AND IS INSERTED PARTLY INTO THE LOWER JAW PARTLY INTO THE BUCCINATOR MUSCLE AND PARTLY BY A THIN MEM BRANE UNDER MOST PART OF THE SKIN OF THE FACE IT SERVES ACCORDING TO THE OPINION OF DR DOUGLAS TO DRAW THE SKIN OF THE FACE DOWNWARDS AND TO AS SIST THE DIGASTRIC IN OPENING THE JAWS THIS LAST OF FICE IS DENIED BY HEISTER AND SO NE OTHERS BUT AS THERE IS A STRONG INSERTION INTO THE LOWER JAW OF THE MOST CONSIDERABLE PART OF THIS MUSCLE I CANNOT BUT JOIN WITH THE FORMER IN THE OPINION THAT ITS CHIEF OFFICE IS TO OPEN THE JAWS FOR THE FIBRES WHICH GO TO THE SKIN OF THE FACE ARE VERY SLENDER AND WEAK INSOMUCH THAT IN MANY SUBJECTS THEY ARE NOT TO BE DISCERNED AT ALL AS TO THE MUSCLES PRO PER TO THE LOWER JAW VIZ THE TEMPORALIS AND MAS SETER31 SETER WHICH PULL IT UPWARDS AND THE DIGASTRICUS PTERIGOIDOEUS INTERNUS AND PTERIGOIDOEUS EXTERNUS WHICH SERVE TO DRAW IT DOWNWARDS WE SHALL OMIT THEIR DESCRIPTIONS HERE SINCE THEY DO NOT COME UNDER THE SUBJECT WE ARE AT PRESENT CONFIND TO WHICH IS ONLY TO TREAT OF THOSE MUSCLES ALONE WHOSE MOTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO THE INFLUENCES OF THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND IN ALTERING THE COUNTENANCE OR WHICH SERVE TO ITS FORMATION THE END OF THE FIRST LECTURE32 L E C T U R E II I GENTLEMEN READ NOV 27 1746 IN MY LECTURE OF LAST THURSDAY I HAD THE HONOUR OF DEMONSTRATING BEFORE YOU THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE AND AT THE SAME TIME OF EXPLAINING THEIR SENSIBLE MOTIONS WHICH WAS THE FIRST THING I PROPOSED IN MY PREAMBLE TO THAT LEC TURE IT NOW REMAINS TO SHEW YOU WHICH OF THESE MUSCLES ACT IN THE SEVERAL MOTIONS OF THE FACE THAT EXPRESS THE DIFFERENT PASSIONS OF THE MIND FOR THEY SERVE TWO PRINCIPAL ENDS FIRST ALTOGETHER TO FORM THE SYMMETRY OF THE COUNTENANCE BY SUPPORTING THE SKIN OF THE FACE IN THE MANNER WE SEE IT WHEN A GENERAL COMPOSURE APPEARS THRO THE WHOLE AND SECONDLY TO EXPRESS AS WE HAVE SAID THOSE PASSIONS OF JOY GRIEF FURY ILLNATURE AND SUCHLIKE AS THE MIND IS OFTEN PRONE TO SUGGEST AND MAY INDEED BE SAID TO BECOME THE GLORY OR DISGRACE OF THE MAN ACCORDING AS THEY OBEY THE DICTATES OF THE MIND IN THOSE CASES OR IN OTHER WORDS AS THEY ARE MOST PREDOMINANT II33 II IT IS CERTAIN WHATEVER STRESS MAY BE LAID ON THAT TRITE PHRASE  FRONTI NULLA FIDES THAT IF WE BUT DULY CONSIDER WHAT IS A GREAT TRUTH THAT THE COUN TENANCE IS THE NUNCIO OF THE MIND AND ONLY BECOME WELL VERSED IN THE PROPER ACTIONS AND PREDOMINANCY OF ITS SEVERAL MUSCLES WE SHALL HAVE A GREAT DEAL OF REASON TO REVERSE THAT SENTENCE SINCE ALSO WE MUST FROM EVERY DAYS EXPERIENCE SEE A FACE PROMISE WHAT WE AFTERWARDS FIND TO BE THE REAL DISPOSITION OF THE PERSON WHO WEARS IT III PROVIDENCE IS WISE IN CAUSING THIS TO BE SO AND IT HAS ITS CONSIDERABLE USES IN NATURE DOES IT NOT CHEER AND PLEASE SOCIETY TO SEE AN OPEN CHEERFUL FACE AMONG THEM DOES NOT A SORROWFUL ASPECT MOVE MANKIND WHO ARE NATURALLY PRONE TO COM PASSION DOES NOT A COUNTENANCE EXPRESLING FEAR GIVE WARNING TO OTHERS TO PREPARE AGAINST THE DAN GER DOES NOT A SNEERING SCORNFUL FACE WARN US TO BEWARE OF ITS OWNER AND DOES NOT A SURLY MOROSE OR DOGGED ASPECT GIVE MEN DISTRUST FORBID FRIEND SHIP AND FILL SOCIETIES WITH UNEASY APPREHENSIONS IV IT WAS BECAUSE THE MEANS OF SELFPRESERVATION SHOULD BE GENEROUSLY DISTRIBUTED TO US THAT THE PRE VAILING CHARACTERISTICS OF TEMPERS SHOULD BE THUS F CONSPICUOUS34 CONSPICUOUS IN US INNUMERABLE INSTANCES OF WHICH ARE TO BE OBSERVED IN EVERY OTHER PART OF THE ANIMAL WORLD BESIDES AND EVEN FROM HENCE WE MIGHT NA TURALLY CONCLUDE IT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY BUT THE STRUCTURES OF THESE PARTS THEIR SENSIBLE ACTIONS AND THE GREAT CONSENT BETWEEN ONE PART OF THE ANIMAL AND ANOTHER FROM THEIR NERVOUS COMMUNICATIONS YET MORE PLAINLY CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION V WHATSOEVER SOVEREIGNTY THE DIAPHRAGM IS KNOWN TO HAVE IN RESPIRATION WHICH CONCERNS THE CIRCULA TION OF THE BLOOD IN THE GREATEST MEASURE SINCE THE SEAT OF THE HEART IS FORMED UPON THAT ORGAN IN HU MAN BODIES I AM NOW ALMOST CONFIDENT FROM MANY SCRUTINIES AND OBSERVATIONS MADE UPON IT FOR SEVE RAL YEARS THAT IT HAS NO SMALL SHARE IN BEING A PRIN CIPAL INSTRUMENT OF RECEIVING AND COMMUNICATING THE IMPULSES OF THE WILL TO THE SEVERAL PARTS WHICH ARE DESTINED FOR THE EXPRESSION OR PUBLICATION OF THE IN TENTION OF THAT WILL OR MIND NOW IN ORDER TO PROVE THIS LET US ONLY CONSIDER THAT WHEN AN OB JECT OF MIRTH OFFERS TO US THE LAUGHTER OR QUICK CONCUSSION OF THE LUNGS IS BEGUN BY THE DIAPHRAGM WHICH IS NO SOONER SET IN MOTION TO EXPRESS THE PLEASURE CONCEIVED AT IT THAN THE MUSCLES SERVING TO FORM A SMILE UPON THE COUNTENANCE ARE IMME DIATELY INFLUENCED AND A GENTLER OR MORE FORCIBLE DRAWING OF THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH BACKWARDS IS EXCITED ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF MIRTH BEFORE US NOW FROM THE FIRST INFLUENCE OF THE DIAPHRAGM WHEN GRIEF IS THE SUBJECT ALSO WE PLAINLY SEE THAT THE35 THE MUSCLES WHICH ARE PROPER TO EXPRESS THAT PASSION ARE ALONE ACTUATED AND WHEN IT INCREASES TO AN IM MODERATE WEEPING THERE ARE NOT WANTING CONCUS SIONS OF THE DIAPHRAGM HERE TOO AS WELL AS IN IM MODERATE LAUGHTER SO THAT THERE MAY BE SAID TO BE A RECIPROCAL COMMERCE BETWEEN THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE NOT ONLY TO DEMONSTRATE THESE PASSIONS BUT INDEED ALL OTHERS WE SEE IMPRINTED ON THE COUNTENANCE BY MEANS OF THE NERVOUS SYM PATHY BETWEEN THEM VI FROM THE PHIL TRANS NO 153 P 395 BEING AN EXTRACT OF THE TWENTYFOURTH DISSERTATION OF SPONS RECHERCHES CURIEUSES C PRINTED AT LYONS 1683 IN 4TO IT IS EASY TO SEE WHAT A SLIGHT FOUNDATION THEY FORMERLY HAD FOR THEIR NOTIONS OF THE MATTER  WE  LEARN SAYS HE THE USE OF ANCIENT MEDALS PICTURES  AND STATUES OF WHICH VARRO J CAESAR AND ALEX  ANDER SEVERUS WERE GREAT COLLECTORS AS RELATING  TO OTHER STUDIES SO SPECIALLY TO PHYSIOGNOMY  NATURE HAVING IMPRINTED IN THE COUNTENANCE CER  TAIN AIRS AND CONFORMATIONS WHICH DISCOVER THE  GRAND INCLINATIONS OF THE MIND IN THIS ART THE  FAMOUS CAMPANELLA WAS A GREAT MASTER AS MR  CHONER RELATES IN THE LIFE OF BOISET HENCE  NISIUS ERYTHRAEUS TELLS US THAT B STEPHANIUS THE  POET HAD THE SAME FEATURES WITH THE STATUES OF  VIRGIL OTHERS OBSERVE THAT NUMA POMPILIUS  AND ANTONINUS PIUS RESEMBLED EACH OTHER IN FACE  AND MANNERS AND THAT THE CHANCELLOR HOSPITALIUS  A GREAT PHILOSOPHER WAS LIKE THE FIGURE OF ARISTOTLE F 2 THE36  THE FACE OF ALEXANDER MAGNUS UPON HIS COINS  HIS EYES SET HIGH AND GREAT WITH HIS CHIN THRUST  OUT SPEAK HIM HAUGHTY EARNEST AND COURAGIOUS  AS PLUTARCH REMARKED FROM THE PHYSIOGNOMISTS  THE FRIZZLED HAIR OF POMPEY AND HIS FORWARD  COUNTENANCE SHEW HIS STOUTNESS AND AMBITION  THE TEMPERAMENT AND DISPOSITION OF JULIUS CAESAR  IS READ IN HIS COINS AS DIVERS HAVE OBSERVED AND  AT LENGTH DR ANDREAS OUT OF ARGOLI MAROUS  ANTONINUSS DOUBLE CHIN SHEWS HIS LOVE OF PLEA  SURE THE AIR OF KING JUBA ARGUES HIM CRUEL AND  ARROGANT THE GOOD FEATURES OF AUGUSTUS DECLARE  AN EXCELLENT MIND A MIXTURE OF SWEETNESS AND  PRUDENCE AND COURAGE THE LITTLE EYES OF NERO  HIS THICK NECK HIS THROAT AND CHIN CONJOIND  WERE NO GOOD SIGNS TO THE ROMANS AND THE STA  TURE OF MAXIMINUS AND NARROW CHIN BESPAKE  HIS CRUELTY VII BUT ALL THIS KIND OF DOCTRINE OF PHYSIOGNOMY MUST VERY OFTEN DECEIVE BECAUSE IT WAS TAKEN CHIEFLY FROM INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED DURING THE REIGNS AND AUTHORITY OF GREAT PERSONAGES WHO WERE VERY CON SPICUOUS IN THEIR STATIONS AND WHO CONSEQUENTLY DREW THE ATTENTION OF THESE OBSERVERS UPON THEM SELVES THUS WHEN THE CHARACTER OF THE PERSON WAS KNOWN AN ACCOUNT OF HIS FACE WAS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN AND A STANDARD LAID DOWN FOR EVERY PERSON WHO IN ANY WISE HAD A RESEMBLANCE TO IT AS IF THE LENGTH OR SHORTNESS OF NOSE OR CHIN COULD BE AN INDICATION OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE MIND BUT SUCH OBSERVERS37 OBSERVERS SHOULD HAVE CONSIDERED THAT THE GENERAL FORM OF THE FACE AND HEAD IS CHIEFLY OWING TO THE STRUCTURE OF THE BONES THAT COMPOSE THEM AND THAT A PERSON WITH A LONG CHIN OR NOSE C MAY BE EITHER OF A GOOD OR BAD TURN OF MIND AND ON THE CONTRARY THOSE WITH THE BEST PROPORTIONED FACES MAY BE POSSESSED OF UNHAPPY AS WELL AS HAPPY TEM PERS SO THAT LET THIS BE AS IT WILL IT IS THE ALTERA TION OF THE MUSCLES ALONE THAT IS CAPABLE OF DEMON STRATING THE REIGNING PASSION OF THE MIND UPON EVERY KIND OF FACE VIII SOME OBSERVERS TOOK THEIR INDICATIONS FROM THE TINTS OF THE COUNTENANCE AND JUDGD ACCORDING TO THEM THAT IS FROM THE PALE RED LIVID BROWN YELLOWISH OR OLIVE BUT HOWEVER THESE MAY SERVE AS INDICATIONS WHEREBY TO LEAD TO THE KNOWLEGE OF DISEASES EVERY DAYS EXPERIENCE SHEWS THEY CAN GIVE NO INFORMATION OF THE DISPOSITION OF THE MIND FOR THERE ARE AMONGST MEN OF ALL HUES BOTH GOOD AND BAD CHEERFUL AND DEJECTED AND THE LIKE IX ARISTOTLE WHO HAS AMONG HIS WORKS A PARTICULAR TREATISE UPON PHYSIOGNOMY AND WHICH ONE WOULD IMAGINE HAS BEEN THE GROUND WORK ON WHICH THE WRITERS UPON THAT SUBJECT HAVE RAISED ALL THEY HAVE SAID ABOUT IT HAS NOT OMITTED ONE CIRCUMSTANEE THAT MIGHT IN ANY WISE HELP HIM IN HIS INGENIOUS RE SEARCHES BUT THOSE WHICH ALONE COULD GIVE THE TRUE TOKENS38 TOKENS OF THE DISPOSITIONS OF THE MIND THAT IS THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE HE HAS DRAWN SOME INJUDICIOUS SUPPOSITIONS FROM THE NATIVE COUN TRIES OF MEN OTHERS FROM THE STRENGTH OR WEAK NESS OF THEIR LIMBS OTHERS FROM THE NATURE OR CO LOUR OF THE HAIR OTHERS FROM THE SHORTNESS LENGTH HARDNESS OR SOFTNESS OF THE FLESH AND LIMBS AND HAS LAID GREAT STRESS UPON THE LIKENESS OF THE HUMAN VOICE TO THAT OF OTHER ANIMALS THUS IF THE VOICE WAS LOUD AND SONOROUS HE COMPARED THE PERSON TO A LION BULL OR BARKING DOG ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENCES AND IF ON THE CONTRARY THE VOICE WAS FEEBLE AND MILD HE CONCLUDED THE PERSON PUSILLANI MOUS AND FEARFUL IF WOMEN WERE STRONG HEALTHY AND OF GOOD CONSTITUTIONS HE DECLARED THEM OF A MASCULINE NATURE AND IF MEN WERE WEAKLY HE ESTEEMED THEM AS HAVING MORE OF THE FEMALE DIS POTIONS THAN OTHERWISE AND ALSO DREW SOME RE MARKS FROM THE SIZE ROUNDNESS LENGTH FLATNESS OR PROTUBERANCE OF THE FACE WITHOUT EVER DREAM ING OF THE USE OF THE MUSCLES BELONGING TO IT X THE GREAT LANCISIUS WHOM WE HAVE MENTIONED BEFORE HAS WROTE A PARTICULAR TREATISE TO HIS FRIEND FANTONUS UPON THIS SUBJECT WHICH HE CALLS DISSER TATIO PHYSIOGNOMONICA AND WHICH HE DIVIDES INTO TWO PARTS THE FIRST HE CALLS CHIROSCOPIA WHICH TREATS OF SEVERAL THINGS RELATING TO THE LINES ON THE PALM OF THE HAND AS THEIR ORIGIN WHY THEY ARE MORE IN THE HANDS THAN THE SOLES OF THE FEET THREE KINDS IN39 IN THE PALMS THE CAUSES OF THE BEST AND WORST KINDS AND OF THEIR DEFECTS WITH PROGNOSTICS DRAWN FROM THEM AND THE LIKE THE SECOND PART HE CALLS METO POSCOPIA WHICH RELATES ONLY TO THE COUNTENANCE AND IS THE LEAST CONSIDERABLE WHEREIN HE CHIEFLY CONSIDERS THE RUGAE OF THE FOREHEAD WHICH HE DIVIDES INTO THREE KINDS 1 SUCH AS ARE EQUAL AND STRAIT 2 SUCH AS ARE UNEQUAL AND INTERRUPTED 3 WHEN THEY ARE BUT FEW AND SUPERFICIAL AND THE ONLY CONSEQUENCES HE DRAWS FROM THESE WRINKLES ARE THAT THE EQUAL ONES SIGNIFY STRENGTH AND EQUILIBRIUM IN THE FRONTAL MUSCLES THE UNEQUAL ONES THE CONTRARY AND VERY TRULY SAYS THAT IF THE SKIN BE THIN AND LEAN THERE ARE MORE WRINKLES IF THICK A SMALLER NUMBER AND LASTLY WHEN THEY ARE BUT FEW AND ARE SUPER FICIAL IT SHEWS SAYS HE GREAT WEAKNESS OF THE MUSCLE NOW FROM THESE CONDITIONS OF THE MUSCLES OF THE FOREHEAD HE JUDGES OF THE CONDITION OF THE BRAIN IF THAT BE STRONG SO IS THE BRAIN IF WEAK THE LATTER MUST BE SO TOO AND THE LIKE XI THIS AUTHOR PLACES THE SEAT OF THE SOUL SOME WHERE IN THE FORE PART OF THE BRAIN AND THINKS HE HAS FOUND A NEW PART WHICH WAS NEVER TAKEN NOTICE OF BEFORE AND PROMISES THE PUBLICATION OF IT HE HAS NOTHING THAT PARTICULARLY RELATES TO A DEMONSTRA TION OF THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND ON THE COUNTE NANCE BUT THIS GENERAL NOTION  IT IS NOT A DIFFI  CULT MATTER SAYS HE TO DISCERN AN ANGRY MAN  BY HIS FLAMING EYES NOR AN ENVIOUS MAN BY  THEIR40  THEIR DISTORTION AND FROWNING NOR A FEARFUL MAN  BY HIS PALENESS AND TREMBLING NOR A MELANCHOLY  MAN BY HIS DARK AND DEJECTED COUNTENANCE NOR  IN FINE A HAPPY TEMPER BY A FLORID AND CHEER  FUL ASPECT INDEED THERE IS NO GREAT ART IN SEEING THESE INDICATIONS WHICH ARE OBVIOUS TO THE MEANEST CAPACITIES BUT HOW THEY ARE SO AND THE REASONS FOR THEM THIS GREAT MAN HAS NOT THOUGHT WORTH WHILE TO EXPLAIN THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF THAT GREAT MASTER LE BRUN WHO IN HIS ABREGE DUNE CONFERENCE SUR LA PHYSIOGNOMIE AT THE END OF HIS BOOK OF THE PASSIONS LAYS GREAT STRESS UPON FOLLOW ING THE TRACES OF THE LINEAMENTS IN THE FACES OF BRUTES IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE APPETITES AND PASSIONS OF MEN XII J BAPT PORTA WHO IS WELL KNOWN TO THE MEN OF SCIENCE OF ALL NATIONS BUILT HIS SYSTEM OF PHY SIOGNOMY UPON THAT OF ARISTOTLE WHICH HE ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN IN A BOOK INTITULED DE HUMANA PHY SIOGNOMIA ETC WHEREIN HE LAYS IT DOWN AS A CERTAIN TRUTH THAT WHOSOEVER HAS A LIKENESS IN HIS FACE TO THAT OF ANY OTHER ANIMAL THO NEVER SO REMOTE HIS FRAME OF MIND AND PASSIONS MUST BE THE SAME WITH THOSE OF THE ANIMAL WHOSE RESEMBLANCE HE BEARS AND ACCORDINGLY HE MAKES EXAGGERATED FIGURES OF MENS COUNTENANCES LIKE LIONS TIGERS LAMBS AND OTHER CREATURES WITH REMARKS UPON THEM IN ORDER TO GIVE WEIGHT TO THE SYSTEM HE LAYS DOWN BUT HAD HE ONLY STUDIED THE PARTS WHICH CONSTITUTE THE FACE AND THEIR OBEDIENCE TO THE IMPULSES OF THE MIND HE41 HE COULD NOT HAVE PERSISTED IN A METHOD OF ACCOUNT ING FOR ITS PASSIONS BY COMPARING THE FACES OF MEN TO THOSE OF CREATURES WHICH CAN HAVE NO MORE ANA LOGY TO EACH OTHER THAN THE FORCED IMAGINATIONS OF HIS BRAIN COULD PRODUCE XIII MANY OF THE ANCIENTS WERE STRONGLY OF OPINION THAT MENS FACES DISCOVERED THEIR TEMPERS AND THIS MUST HAVE BEEN FOUNDED CHIEFLY UPON A LONG OBSER VATION AND EXPERIENCE OF THE TEMPERS OF MEN WITH WHOM THEY HAD FREQUENTLY CONVERSED FOR THEIR PE NETRATION IN THAT PART OF ANATOMY HAD NOT GONE SO FAR AS AT PRESENT IT DOES WITH US XIV THE SCHOLARS OF SOCRATES BROUGHT A NOTED PHY SIOGNOMIST ZOPYRUS TO THEIR MASTER IN ORDER TO TRY HIS ART WHO VIEWING HIS FACE FOR SOME TIME HAVING HAD NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEGE OF HIM AND AFTER AN EXAMINATION OF HIS ASPECT HE SOON PRONOUNCED HIM THE MOST LEWD DRUNKEN OLD FELLOW HE HAD EVER MET WITH THE DISCIPLES MOCKD AND LAUGH AT HIM AS BE LIEVING HIS ART OF NO EFFECT BUT SOCRATES TOLD THEM HE BELIEVED HIS ART MIGHT BE TRUE NOTWITH STANDING HIS PRESENT MISTAKE FOR THAT HE HIMSELF WAS NATURALLY INCLINED TO THOSE PARTICULAR VICES THE PHY SIOGNOMIST HAD DISCOVERD IN HIS COUNTENANCE BUT THAT HE HAD CONQUERED THE STRONG DISPOSITIONS HE WAS BORN WITH BY THE DICTATES OF PHILOSOPHY G XV42 XV OVID WAS OF THIS OPINION AS APPEARS BY THIS BEAU TIFUL PASSAGE HEU QUAM DIFFICILE EST CRIMEN NON PRODERE VULTU WHICH THE GREAT ADDISON CHOSE FOR A MOTTO TO THE 86TH SPECTATOR WHEREIN HE HAS THE FOLLOWING REFINED SENTIMENTS UPON THIS SUBJECT  EVERY ONE SAYS  HE IS IN SOME DEGREE A MASTER OF THAT ART WHICH  IS GENERALLY DISTINGUISHED BY THE NAME OF PHYSI  OGNOMY AND NATURALLY FORMS TO HIMSELF THE CHA  RACTER OR FORTUNE OF A STRANGER FROM THE FEATURES AND  LINEAMENTS OF HIS FACE WE ARE NO SOONER PRE  SENTED TO ANY ONE WE NEVER SAW BEFORE BUT WE  ARE IMMEDIATELY STRUCK WITH THE IDEA OF A PROUD A  RESERVED AN AFFABLE OR A GOODNATURD MAN AND  UPON OUR FIRST GOING INTO A COMPANY OF STRANGERS  OUR BENEVOLENCE OR AVERSION AWE OR CONTEMPT  RISES NATURALLY TOWARD SEVERAL PARTICULAR PERSONS  BEFORE WE HAVE HEARD THEM SPEAK A SINGLE WORD  OR SO MUCH AS KNOW WHO THEY ARE  EVERY PASSION GIVES A PARTICULAR CAST TO THE  COUNTENANCE AND IS APT TO DISCOVER ITSELF IN SOME  FEATURE OR OTHER I HAVE SEEN AN EYE CURSE FOR  HALF AN HOUR TOGETHER AND AN EYE BROW CALL A  MAN SCOUNDREL  FOR MY PART SAYS HE I AM  SO APT TO FRAME A NOTION OF EVERY MANS HUMOUR  OR CIRCUMSTANCES BY HIS LOOKS THAT I HAVE SOME  TIMES EMPLOYD MYSELF FROM CHARINGCROSS TO THE  ROYAL EXCHANGE IN DRAWING THE CHARACTERS OF THOSE  WHO43  WHO HAVE PASSED BY ME WHEN I SEE A MAN WITH  A SOUR RIVELLD FACE I CANNOT FORBEAR PITYING HIS  WIFE AND WHEN I MEET WITH AN OPEN INGENUOUS  COUNTENANCE THINK ON THE HAPPINESS OF HIS FRIENDS  HIS FAMILY AND RELATIONS  I THINK WE MAY BE  BETTER KNOWN BY OUR LOOKS THAN BY OUR WORDS  AND THAT A MANS SPEECH IS MUCH MORE EASILY DIS  GUISED THAN HIS COUNTENANCE IN THIS CASE HOW  EVER I THINK THE AIR OF THE WHOLE FACE IS MUCH  MORE EXPRESSIVE THAN THE LINES OF IT THE TRUTH  OF IT IS THE AIR IS GENERALLY NOTHING ELSE BUT THE  INWARD DISPOSITION OF THE MIND MADE VISIBLE XVI THIS MAXIM I AM NOW ABOUT TO PROVE TO YOU IN A FEW WORDS BY ANSWERING AN OBJECTION MADE TO ME ON THAT SENTIMENT  A GENTLEMAN AGREED WITH ME THAT THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE OBEYD AND EX PRESSED THE DIFFERENT PASSIONS OF THE MIND OCCASIONALLY BUT THAT WHEN THE CAUSE OF THAT PASSION CEASES THE FACE RESUMES ITS NATURAL POSITION AND THAT PASSION APPEARS NO MORE FOR THAT TIME XVII TO THIS I ANSWER 1ST THAT EVERY PERSON HAS A PAR TICULAR BENT OR DISPOSITION OF MIND WHICH OFTENER REIGNS IN HIM THAN ANY OTHER 2DLY THAT THIS HA BITUAL DISPOSITION CAUSING THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE THAT ARE DESTINED TO EXPRESS IT FREQUENTLY TO ACT IN OBEDIENCE TO THAT BENT OF MIND BRINGS ON AT LENGTH AN HABITUAL APPEARANCE OF THAT PASSION IN THE FACE G 2 AND44 AND MOULDS IT INTO A CONSTANT CONSENT WITH THE MIND IN THE COURSE OF MY OWN ACQUAINTANCE I KNOW SOME PERSONS WHO WEAR ON THEIR COUNTENANCES A CON TINUAL CHEERFULNESS COMPLACENCY AND OPENNESS AND BY EXPERIENCE I KNOW IT TO BE THEIR CONTINUAL DISPOSITION OF MIND AND ON THE OTHER HAND I ALSO KNOW SOME ON WHOSE FACES A SETTLED MOROSENESS ALWAYS STRIKES THE BEHOLDER AND KNOW IT TO BE THEIR OWN CONSTANT PLAGUE AND THAT OF THOSE AMONG WHOM THEY COME XVIII THIS NEED NOT BE WONDERD AT NOR INDEED CAN IT BE DENIED FOR THAT SUCH A HABITUDE OF COUNTENANCE IS EASILY ACQUIRD WILL APPEAR CERTAIN IF WE DO BUT OBSERVE WHAT HAPPENS EVERY DAY WE MAY TAKE NOTICE THAT AMONG SCHOOLBOYS IF THERE BE ONE WHO STAMMERS IN HIS SPEECH IT WILL SPEEDILY BE ACQUIRD BY THE OTHERS AND I HAVE KNOWN TWO BOYS WHOSE FATHERS WERE MY ACQUAINTANCE CATCH THAT HABIT OF SPEAKING AT SCHOOL AND HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO SHAKE IT OFF I HAVE ALSO KNOWN A YOUTH CATCH A HABIT OF WINKING THE UPPER LID OF HIS EYES QUICKER THAN THE SECONDS OF A CLOCK BY HAVING SOMETIMES SEEN AN EPILEPTIC WHO FRE QUENTED THE QUARTER WHERE HE LIVED AND I PERSONALLY KNEW A GENTLEMAN EMINENT IN THE LAW WHO CESLANTLY WINKED WITH ONE EYE AND TOLD ME TO SATISFY MY CURIOSITY THAT HIS FATHER HAD A SERVANT WHEN HE WAS A CHILD WHO HAD AN INVOLUNTARY WINKING WHICH HE HAD ACQUIRD AND WHICH NOT WITHSTANDING HIS HAVING BEEN SENT AWAY TO A DISTANT SCHOOL45 SCHOOL WHEN HIS PARENTS HAD DISCOVERD IT HE NEVER WAS ABLE TO SHAKE OFF ADD TO THIS THAT THERE ARE MANY WHO ACQUIRE SQUINTING DISTORTIONS OF THEIR VERY EYES BY SEEING OTHERS TOO OFTEN WHO ARE TROUBLED WITH THAT MALADY XIX NOW WHAT BUT A HABIT ACQUIRED BY SOME MUSCLE OR OTHER COULD HAVE PRODUCED THESE EFFECTS HOWEVER IN ORDER TO BE AS FAIR AND CLEAR AS I CAN IN THE PROOF OF MY ASSERTION I WILL ANSWER ANOTHER OBJECTION OF THE SAME GENTLEMAN WHICH IS ALL I SHALL AT PRESENT TROUBLE YOU WITH UPON THIS HEAD XX SAYS MY FRIEND  I HAVE KNOWN ONE OF THESE CRABBED SOURFACED MEN LOOK AS AGREEABLY AS ONE COULD WISH AND ON THE OTHER HAND SAYS HE ONE OF THOSE MERRYFACED GENTLEMEN PUT ON A COUNTE NANCE AS FULL OF FURY AS POSSIBLE IT IS VERY TRUE I AGREE WITH HIM IN THIS AND IT IS RIGHT IT SHOULD BE SO BECAUSE EVERY PERSON OF WHATSOEVER TEMPER OF MIND OUGHT TO HAVE A POWER OF ALTERING IT UPON A NECESSARY OCCASION AND OF SHEWING HIS APPROBA TION OR DISLIKE OF ANY AFFAIR THAT MAY CHANCE TO OFFER BUT IS THE MOROSE MAN LONG PLEASED OR THE HAPPY MAN LONG DISPLEASED AND DOES NOT EACH RE TURN SOON TO HIS FORMER HABITUAL MIND AND COUNTE NANCE WHEN THE OCCASION OF THEIR ALTERATION CEASES XXI46 XXII MY FRIEND MIGHT HAVE STARTED OTHER OBJECTIONS AND WHICH INDEED ARE IN SOME MEASURE EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL SYSTEM I HAVE LAID DOWN BUT WHICH CANNOT INVALIDATE THE LEAST PART OF IT WHEN THE REA SONS FOR THEM ARE EXPLAIND FIRST HE MAY ARGUE THAT THERE ARE MANY MANIACS WHO ARE IN A CONSTANT STATE OF MADNESS AND YET THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE ARE IN NOWISE DISTORTED NOR ANY OTHER APPEARANCE OF WILDNESS IN THE COUNTENANCE THAN WHAT THE EYES PRODUCE BUT THIS HAPPENS ONLY BECAUSE THE MORBID MADNESS IS INVOLUNTARY WHEREAS ALL THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND WHICH CORRESPOND WITH AND ACTUATE THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE ARE VOLUNTARY AND CONSEQUENTLY DRAW THE MUSCLES SUBSERVIENT TO EACH PARTICULAR ONE INTO CONSENT THE PLAYER ACTING HIS PART WITH JUDGMENT IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THESE EFFECTS HE CAN ARTFULLY PUT ON THE GRIMACE WHICH BEST EXPRESSES OR ACCOMPANIES THE CHARACTER HE IS TO REPRESENT AS THE MAN WHOSE NATURAL TEMPER ALSO LEADS HIM TO WEAR THE ASPECT SUITED TO HIS STATE OF MIND WHAT SOEVER IT BE AND AS SUCH A ONE CAN OCCASIONALLY CHANGE HIS ASPECT THO BUT FOR A LITTLE TIME FROM ITS CUSTOMARY STATE IT IS PLAIN THAT THE CUSTOMARY PAS SIONS OF THE MIND ARE FIRST VOLUNTARY AND THE ACTIONS OF THEIR SEVERAL SUBSERVIENT MUSCLES ARE SO TOO AND 2DLY THERE CAN BE NO REIGNING GESTURE OF THE FACE DISCERNABLE IN IDIOTS EXPRESSIVE OF ANY PASSION BE CAUSE THEY CAN HAVE NO SETTLED INTENTION TO PRODUCE ONE OR RENDER IT CUSTOMARY IN THEIR GENERAL CON DUCT47 DUCT WHENCE IT MAY BE VERY JUSTLY SAID SUCH POOR CREATURES HAVE UNMEANING COUNTENANCES XXII FROM WHAT I HAVE HITHERTO LAID DOWN AND FROM THE FOLLOWING EXPLANATION OF THE FIGURES I HOPE IT WILL APPEAR THAT NO ANALOGY CAN BE DRAWN FROM BRUTES NO SIGNS FROM THE VOICE NOR GENERAL SHAPE OF THE FACE OR ANY OF ITS PARTS IN A WORD NOTHING BUT THE ACTIONS OF THE MUSCLES BECOME HABITUAL IN OBEDIENCE TO THE REIGNING TEMPERS OF THE MIND CAN IN ANY WISE ACCOUNT FOR THEM AND

BE INCREASED TO THE MOST PROFOUND VENERATION BY A LITTLE AUGMENTING THEIR ACTIONS THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM DRAWS UP THE UPPER LID OF EACH EYE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE ELEVATOR BY ITS CONTRACTION TURNS UP THE PUPIL FOR IN THIS CASE THEY ACT IN PERFECT HARMONY AND THESE ACTIONS ARE BUT MODERATE YET ARE SUFFICIENT TO SHEW THE MEANING OF THE MIND IN THE SEVERAL PASSIONS WE SHALL54 SHALL BRING UNDER THIS HEAD THE MOUTH ALSO IS BUT MODERATELY OPENED NOT BY THE ACTION OF THE MUS CLES THAT SERVE TO PULL DOWN THE LOWER JAW BECAUSE WHEN THEY ACT THEY OPEN THE MOUTH PRETTY WIDE BUT BY THE REMISSION OF THE ACTION OF THOSE MUSCLES WHICH SERVE TO PULL IT UP FOR THIS MAXIM IS NECES SARILY TRUE THAT BETWEEN THE ACTIONS OF ANY MUSCLE AND ITS ANTAGONIST THERE MUST BE A RE MISSION OF THE FORMER SO THAT AS IN THE CASE BEFORE US THE REMISSION IS SOMETIMES SUFFICIENT WITHOUT ANY NECESSITY FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ACTION OF THE ANTAGONIST THE SAME IS OBSERVED BEFORE WHERE WE MENTION THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS AND THE CORRUGATOR COITERI BUT IN ORDER TO RENDER THIS REMISSION OF THE TEM PORALIS AND MASSETER WHICH ARE THE MUSCLES SERVING TO DRAW UP THE JAW MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD LET US ONLY OBSERVE A PERSON SLEEPING IN A CHAIR WITH HIS HEAD LEANING DIRECTLY BACKWARD OR UPON HIS BACK IN BED AT WHICH TIME THE MIND IS QUITE UNDETERMINED TO ANY DESIGN WE SHALL SEE THE LOWER JAW FALL BY ITS OWN GRAVITY WHICH CANNOT HAPPEN BUT BY THE RE MISSION ALONE OF THOSE MUSCLES MENTIOND BECAUSE THE DIGASTRICUS PTERIGOIDAEUS EXTERNUS AND PTE RIGOIDAEUS INTERNUS WHICH SERVE TO OPEN THE JAW ARE AS MUCH AT REST AS THE FORMER THIS ANY ONE MAY PROVE BY LEANING HIS HEAD BACK AND LETTING HIS JAW FALL SPONTANEOUSLY AS FAR AS IT WILL GO AND THEN BY BRINGING THOSE MUSCLES JUST MENTIONED INTO ACTION HE WILL BE ABLE TO PULL IT DOWN YET LOWER BUT IF A MANS HEAD LEANS FORWARD ON HIS BREAST IN A CHAIR OR IF IN BED HIS BOLSTER AND PILLOW BE HIGH WHILE HE SLEEPS55 SLEEPS THEN THE PRESSURE OF HIS CHIN UPON HIS BREAST KEEPS HIS MOUTH SHUT THE PASSIONS OF THE MIND THAT ARE GENERALLY EX PRESSED BY THE ACTIONS AND REMISSIONS OF THE MUS CLES MENTIOND WITH BUT VERY LITTLE VARIATION ARE 1 ESTEEM FOR ANY OBJECT  IF THE OBJECT BE OF DIVINE OR OTHERWISE OF A SUPERIOR NATURE THE PRE SENT SYSTEM OF THE FACE SERVES TO EXPRESS THE ESTEEM WITH A GRACEFUL HUMILITY SUCH AS IS BECOMING IN ADORING THE DIVINE BEING OR IN PROFESSING A GRATE FUL RESPECT FOR SUPERIORS WHO HAVE CONFERRD ANY FAVOURS AND IF THIS COUNTENANCE BE ACCOMPANIED WITH OTHER ACTIONS OF THE BODY THAT ARE GENERALLY CONCOMITANT WITH IT AS THE HEAD BOWD OR INCLIND FORWARDS THE HANDS SPREAD FORWARDS OR LIFTED UP THE KNEES BENT AND THE BODY INCLINED FORWARDS THEN THE APPEARANCE OF THE MINDS DISPOSITIONS IS YET MORE CONSPICUOUS IF THE OBJECT OF ESTEEM BE EXTENDED TO ANY FRIEND WHO CAN CLAIM NO SUPERIORITY OR BE ANY MATTER OF CURIOSITY THEN IT IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSED BY THIS SET TLED COUNTENANCE ONLY BRINGING THE PUPILS OF THE EYES TO VIEW THE OBJECT HAVING THE LIDS BUT MODE RATELY OPEND INSTEAD OF BEING ELEVATED WHETHER THE PERSON SITS OR STANDS 2 LOVE IS A PASSION WHICH IS A NATURAL FOLLOWER OF ESTEEM ACCORDING TO THE DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ATTEND IT AND CAN ONLY BE CONCEIVED FOR PER SONS THE EXPRESSION OF SIMPLE FRIENDSHIP IS JUST AC COUNTED FOR AND ALSO THE REGARD FOR OBJECTS OF CURIOSITY THIS PASSION THEN AS IT IS A LITTLE MORE EARNEST REQUIRES SOME SMALL ALTERATION IN ITS EXPRES SION UPON THE COUNTENANCE THUS IF A LOVER IS MAKING56 MAKING AN ADDRESS IN CONVERSATION OR IF THERE BE A RECIPROCAL AFFECTION IN THE PERSON TO WHOM THE ADDRESS IS MADE IT WILL BE EXPRESSED BY THIS SYSTEM OF THE FACE WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT IN THE MAN THE HEAD INCLINED DOWNWARDS AND TO ONE SIDE WILL CAUSE THE EYES TO APPEAR MORE LANGUISHING AND IN THE WOMAN THE LIDS BUT MODERATELY OPEN AND THE PUPILS RATHER CARRIED A LITTLE DOWNWARDS WILL BE VERY EXPRESSIVE FOR IN THE MAN THIS LOVE AMOUNTS TO VENERATION IN THE WOMAN TO AN ESTEEM ADORND WITH A MODEST DEPORTMENT IF IT BE ATTENDED WITH DESIRE THE SAME ASPECT WILL SERVE TO EXPRESS IT WITH THE ADDITION ONLY OF A MORE FLORID AND VIVID COLOUR OF THE LIPS AND CHEEKS AND THE PUPILS OF THE EYES DIRECTED TO THE OBJECT OF LOVE THUS GAZED ANTIOCHUS FROM HIS BED FASTENING HIS EYES UPON HIS CHARMER OF WHOM I HOPE I MAY BE ALLOWD THE LIBERTY TO GIVE A SHORT ACCOUNT BEING A MOVING AND INTERESTING

MENTIOND AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE BETTER IMPRINTED ON THE COUNTENANCE THAN BY THIS VERY SYSTEM THESE ARE THE MUSCLES WHICH ACT AND ARE REMITTED TO EXPRESS IT IN OBEDIENCE TO THE MIND FOR AS IT CONSISTS ONLY OF A SEEMING LIKELIHOOD OR EXPECTATION OF OBTAINING WHAT WE EARNESTLY DE SIRE LOVE ESTEEM OR VENERATE AND AS IT MUST BE SOMETHING PLEASING AND AGREEABLE WE HOPE FOR THE COUNTENANCE MUST BE THE SAME AS IN THIS FIGURE WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT THE CORNERS OF THE MOUTH MUST BE DRAWN A VERY LITTLE MORE BACKWARDS AND TURNED UPWARDS WHICH INCREASES THE APPEARANCE OF THE SA TISFACTION UPON THE COUNTENANCE THAT DEMONSTRATES SUCH AN EXPECTATION FOR WE MAY LOVE OR DESIRE AN OBJECT THAT WE MAY NEVER HAVE THE LEAST HOPE OF OBTAINING WHICH IS THE CAUSE OF THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE ASPECT THE HARMONY OF THIS COUNTENANCE SHEWS ALSO THAT IT PARTAKES OF ALL THE AMIABLE QUALITIES MENTIOND IN OUR EXPLANATION OF THE LAST FIGURE WHICH IS CAPA BLE OF BEING ALTERD ONLY INTO THE CLASS OF THESE NO BLE

BECAUSE TRUTH SHINES EVERYWHERE ABOUT IT IF INTO ADORATION AND WORSHIP IT IS NOT LIKELY TO BE BLENDED WITH HYPOCRISY IF INTO FRIENDSHIP AND LOVE WE ARE SURE IT IS SINCERE AND IF INTO HOPE WE MAY DE PEND IT IS NOT FOR TRIFLING VANITIES FOR ITSELF NOR FOR EVIL TOWARDS OTHERS THERE IS ALSO CONNECTED WITH THIS FRAME OF MIND THE MOST SOLID AND LASTING CONTENTMENT AND EVEN NESS OF TEMPER TOGETHER WITH THE HEAVENLY DISPO SITION TO AN UNMERCENARY FRIENDSHIP FOR MANKIND NOTHING IS MORE NOBLE IN ITSELF YET NOTHING MORE RARE AND IS TO BE NO WHERE SO CERTAINLY FOUND AS IN A HEART CONTENT WITH ITS OWN

ELEVATORS 3 THE DIGASTRICUS AND LATISSIMUS COLLI PULL DOWN THE LOWER JAW THE REASON WHY THE EYES AND MOUTH ARE SUD DENLY OPEND IN FRIGHTS SEEMS TO BE THAT THE OB JECT OF DANGER MAY BE THE BETTER PERCEIVED AND AVOIDED AS IF NATURE INTENDED TO LAY OPEN ALL THE INLETS TO THE SENSES FOR THE SAFETY OF THE ANIMAL THE EYES THAT THEY MAY SEE THEIR DANGER AND THE MOUTH WHICH IS IN THIS CASE AN ASSISTANT TO THE EARS THAT THEY MAY HEAR IT THIS MAY PERHAPS SUR PRISE SOME THAT THE MOUTH SHOULD BE NECESSARY TO HEAR BY BUT IT IS A COMMON THING TO SEE MEN WHOSE HEARING IS NOT VERY GOOD OPEN THEIR MOUTHS WITH ATTENTION WHEN THEY LISTEN AND IT IS SOME HELP TO THEM THE REASON IS THAT THERE IS A PASSAGE FROM THE MEATUS AUDITORIUS WHICH OPENS INTO THE MOUTH61 MOUTH THUS WE SEE HOW READY NATURE IS UPON ANY EMERGENCY TO LAY HOLD OF EVERY OCCASION FOR SELF PRESERVATION BUT WHEN A PERSON IS FRIGHTED SO AS NOT TO BE UNDER AN INSTANTANEOUS APPREHENSION OF DANGER BY BEING PURSUED OR THE LIKE THEN THE UPPER PART OF THE FACE WILL BE AS IN THIS FIGURE AND THE LOWER SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT APPEARS HERE THAT IS THE MOUTH WILL OPEN MODERATELY BY THE REMIS SION OF THE ACTIONS OF THE TEMPORAL AND MASSETER MUSCLES HAVING THE CORNERS OR RICTUS ORIS IN CLIND A LITTLE DOWNWARDS IT HAS BEEN IMAGIND THAT THE EYEBROWS MIGHT BE MOVED IN PARTS THAT IS THAT ONE PART OF A BROW MAY BE PULLD UP WHILE THE OTHER IS PULLD DOWN BUT THIS CANNOT BE FOR THE OCCIPITOFRONTALIS WHICH PULLS UP THE BROW ACTS ALL AT ONCE ON EITHER SIDE SO THAT THE INTIRE BROW MUST BE PULLD UP AT ONCE OR BY ITS REMISSION LET DOWN AT ONCE I NEVER YET SAW ANY ONE WHO WAS ABLE TO GIVE THEM THIS PAR TIAL MOTION AND THERE ARE BUT FEW WHO CAN RAISE EITHER WITHOUT THE OTHER AT THE SAME TIME SO THAT THIS OPINION AMOUNTS TO SOMETHING NATURE NEVER IN TENDED AND IS AN EXAGGERATION WHICH RENDERS ANY FIGURES PREPOSTEROUS FEAR HORROR AND TERROR ARE BUT TERMS WHICH SIGNIFY THE SAME PASSION ONLY IN DIFFERENT DEGREES AND ARE ALL EXPRESSED BY THIS FIGURE ONLY RENDERING THE CHANGE OF FEATURES BY THE MOTION OF THE MUS CLES GREATER OR LESS WHICH IF ACCOMPANIED WITH CERTAIN ACTIONS OF THE BODY WOULD EXPRESS THEM MORE ABSOLUTELY AS FOR EXAMPLE IF ON THE GROUND UNDER AN ENEMY RESOLVED ON THE DESTRUCTION OF THE FRIGHTED62 FRIGHTED PERSON WITH HANDS LIFTED UP AND FINGERS STRETCHD FAR ASUNDER DREADING THE FATAL BLOW OR IF FLYING FROM

WHY THE LOWER JAW IS PULLD DOWN IN ORDER TO OPEN THE MOUTH AND THAT IS SINCE EVERY ASSIST ANCE IS NECESSARY FOR THE RELIEF OF THE PERSONS FRIGHTED THAT THEY MAY THE MORE FREELY EXHIBIT THEIR VOICES IN SHRIEKING AND CRYING OUT IN ORDER TO ALARM AND SUM MON ALL WITHIN THE CALL TO THEIR RESCUE WHO WITH OUT IT MIGHT KNOW NOTHING OF THE DISTRESS THO NEAR ENOUGH TO GIVE TIMELY AID TO THIS CLASS MAY BE ADDED DESPAIR AND THE SAME COUNTENANCE WILL SERVE TO EXPRESS IT WITH VERY LITTLE ALTERATION FOR AS THE FIRST ADVANCE TO THAT PASSION IS THE FEAR TERROR OR DREAD OF ANY DANGER AND IS THUS EXPRESSED SO THE DEPRIVATION OF ANY HOPE FOR RELIEF AND THE PERPETUAL DREAD OF MEETING THE FATAL SHOCK IS DESPAIR AND THEREFORE BY ADDING PALE NESS AND A LIVID ASPECT TO THIS COUNTENANCE IT WILL BE WELL REPRESENTED BECAUSE WHEN ALL HOPES ARE GIVEN OVER THE BLOOD GROWS LANGUID IN EVERY PART NOTWITHSTANDING THE SAME FEAR AND TERROR RE MAINS FROM THE PERSONS CEASING TO MAKE ANY DEFENCE AND AT LENGTH DEGENERATES INTO A MELAN CHOLY64 CHOLY MADNESS SO THAT FLYING OR SITTING OR LYING PROSTRATE ON THE GROUND MAY BE SUITABLE ATTITUDES TO THIS PASSION AND THEN THE COUNTENANCE WILL BE CHANGD AS IN THE PASSION OF GRIEF I CANNOT BUT THINK IT A WRONG APPLICATION OF THE PASSION OF DESPAIR TO REPRESENT IT WITH STARING HAIR CORRUGATED FACE THE BROWS DRAWN DOWN EVEN WITH THE EYES AND THE MOUTH OPEN WITH A WEEPING ASPECT FOR INSTEAD OF SUCH VIOLENT CONTRACTIONS WHICH ARE SIGNS RATHER OF BODILY PAIN AND TORMENT THERE IS IN DEEP DESPAIR A CESSATION FROM THOSE MUS CULAR ACTIONS IN THE FACE AND THE FIRST ACTIONS OF FRIGHT ARE RATHER REMITTED AS IT WERE INTO A RELAXA TION OF THOSE MUSCLES AND A FALLING OF THE COUNTE NANCE BECAUSE ALL EXERTION TOWARDS A DEFENCE AS I HAVE JUST SAID IS GIVEN UP AND A DESPONDING AND FAINTING ARE OFTEN THE CONSEQUENCES T A B L E IV F I G 1 SHEWS A COUNTENANCE OF SCORN AND DERISION WHICH IS FORMED BY THE FOLLOWING MUSCLES AS SOON AS THE MIND SUGGESTS A CONTEMPT FOR

MUSCLES WHICH SERVE TO FORM THIS ASPECT ARE THE CORRUGATOR COITERI WHICH STRONGLY FORCES THE BROWS DOWNWARDS AND INWARDS AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE APERIENS PALPEBRAM DRAGS UP THE UPPER LIDS OF BOTH

THE EYES ARE MORE OR LESS SHUT AND IF IT IS INCREASED TO A VEHEMENT LAUGHTER THE BUCCINA TORES ARE MORE FORCIBLY CONTRACTED THE SKIN OF THE FACE DRIVEN HIGHER UP BY THE CONTRACTION OF THE ORBICULARIS

MOUTHS VERY WIDE IN LAUGHING AND THEN THE 4 DIGASTRIC MUSCLE AND THE LATISSIMUS COLLI ACT IN PULLING DOWN THE LOWER JAW AND IN SOME PER SONS WHO LAUGH HEARTILY THE MUSCLE CALLD THE SO CIUS PYRAMIDALIS IS DRAWN INTO CONSENT AND BY ITS CONTRACTION WRINKLES THE SKIN OF THE NOSE FROM THIS EXPLANATION IT MAY BE INFERRD THAT THE DEGREE OF JOY ON THE COUNTENANCE MAY BE REPRE SENTED BY RENDERING THE ACTION OF THESE MUSCLES MORE OR LESS STRONG FOR SUPPOSING THE MIND WAS HAPPY AND GLAD UPON ANY OCCASION WHERE IMMEDIATE LAUGHTER DID NOT SEEM NECESSARY A BARE DISPOSITION TO SMILE UPON THE MOUTH WITH THE EYES A LITTLE MORE BUT NOT QUITE OPEN WOULD SUFFICIENTLY DENOTE IT IN THE FIGURE BEFORE US THE MIRTH APPEARS TO BE GREATER AND A MODERATE LAUGHTER INFLUENCES THE WHOLE WHICH SEEMS TO BE REAL FROM THE GENERAL CONSENT BETWEEN THE MOUTH AND EYES BUT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS AND A FICTI TIOUS MIRTH PUT ON TO SERVE AN OCCASION WHEN THE MIND CONSENTS NOT TO IT THIS IS VERY CONSPICUOUS IN SOME PLAYERS ACTING THEIR PARTS IN COMEDIES WHICH REQUIRE MUCH LAUGH TER WHO DO NOT ALWAYS ENTER WELL INTO IT FOR WANT OF THE MINDS INFLUENCE AND THEN THE LAUGHTER PUT ON APPEARS DRY AND UNMEANING AND ALTHO THE MOUTH PUTS ON A SMILE IT SEEMS FORCED BECAUSE THE MUSCLES OF THE EYES ARE NOT IN CONSENT FOR AS THE MIND IS EMPLOYED IN RECOLLECTING THE PART HE IS TO SPEAK L ITS74 ITS NATURAL SUGGESTIONS HAVE NOT BEEN APPLIED TO THAT PASSION AND CONSEQUENTLY ARE NOT FREE ENOUGH TO MAND LAUGHTER BUT IF HE IS PERFECT IN HIS PART HAVING NOTHING TO STUDY WHILE HE ACTS HE IS THEN CAPABLE OF TAKING TO HIMSELF A SHARE IN THE MIRTH AND OF LAUGHING IN CARNEST ANOTHER CASE WHEREIN LAUGHTER IS UNMEANING IS WHEN A PERSON DRESSD WITH ALL THE MARKS OF ADULA TION FEIGNS A LAUGH TO FAVOUR THAT OF A SUPERIOR AND FEED HIS VANITY HERE TOO THE OTHER MUSCLES OF THE FACE GIVE THE LIPS THE LIE AND PROVE THE HY POCRISY FOR IT WANTS THEIR CONSENT AS IN THE CASE JUST MENTIOND THERE IS ANOTHER MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH MAKES LAUGHTER APPEAR DREADFUL AND THAT IS WHEN IT IS CONVULSIVE IN THIS CASE THE NERVES WHICH COM MUNICATE THE CONSENT OR SYMPATHY BETWEEN THE DIAPHRAGM AND THE MUSCLES OF LAUGHTER ARE AFFECTED AND THE CACHINNATIONS OCCASIONED BY THE CONVULSIVE TWITCHES OF THE FORMER DRAW THE LATTER INTO CONSENT TO FORM THAT KIND OF UNNATURAL AND INVOLUNTARY LAUGHTER WHICH IS CALLED BY AUTHORS THE RISUS SARDONICUS  IT IS A MELANCHOLY SIGHT WHEN A PERSON FALLEN TO THE  THIS APPELLATION COMES FROM THE NAME OF A PLANT BY SOME CALLED HERBA SARDONIA OR SARDINIA BY OTHERS APIUM AGROSTE OR APIUM RISUS WHICH IS SAID TO PRODUCE THIS KIND OF CONVULSION AND BEING SAID TO GROW IN GREAT PLENTY IN SARDINIA THENCE CAME THE NAME HERBA SARDONIA AND THENCE THIS NAME RISUS SARDONICUS THIS LAUGHING WITHOUT CAUSE OR RISUS SARDONICUS HAD ANOTHER SOURCE WITH SOME AUTHORS IT WAS SAID THE SARDINIANS USED TO SACRIFICE THEIR PRISONERS TO SATURN WHO LAUGHED TO SHEW THEIR BRAVERY AND FORTITUDE AT THEIR DEATHS ALSO THAT THE SARDINIANS LAUGH WHEN THEY INTEND ANY EVIL TO ANOTHER75 THE GROUND SHALL APPEAR ALL OVER CONVULSED AND DIS TORTED LAUGHING AT THE SAME TIME THAT MISERY AND DISTRESS APPEAR UPON THE WHOLE COUNTENANCE SOME TIMES IT IS FOLLOWD BY IMMODERATE WEEPING FROM THE SAME CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE MUSCLES OF THAT PAS SION IN THE FACE WHICH THO CONVULSIVE IS YET LESS SHOCKING AS IT SEEMS AT LEAST MORE SUITABLE TO THE MISERIES OF THE AFFLICTED POOR CREATURE AN UNFORTUNATE PERSON SOMETIMES FEIGNS A LAUGH TO CONCEAL HIS DISTRESS BUT IT IS EASY TO DISCERN THAT THE HEART IS NOT THE DICTATOR OF THAT SEEMING MIRTH BY OBSERVING THE WANT OF THE SYMPATHY OF OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTENANCE WHEN LAUGHING IS VEHEMENT IT IS A COMMON THING TO SEE TEARS FLOW FROM THE EYES BEFORE THE PER SON WHO LAUGHS HAS QUITE GIVEN OVER BECAUSE BY THE VIOLENCE AND CONTINUATION FOR SOME TIME OF THE MOTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM THE BLOOD IS PUSHD WITH GREAT FORCE TO THE FACE AND CONSEQUENTLY TO THE LACRYMAL GLANDS WHERE BY THAT MEANS JOIND TO THE PRESSURE MADE BY THE STRONG CONTRACTION OF THE ORBICULAR MUSCLES THE TEARS ARE SQUEEZD OUT OF THE GLANDS IN ABUNDANCE AND WHEN ONCE THEY ARE BEGUN WILL CONTINUE TO TRICKLE DOWN TILL THE LAUGH CEASES AND THE DIAPHRAGM AND MUSCLES OF LAUGHTER IN THE FACE ARE AT REST THE APPEARANCE OF THIS COUNTENANCE WITH THE BODY IN AN ATTITUDE SUITABLE TO THE OCCASION WOULD MAKE THE REPRESENTATION STILL THE BETTER AS SITTING IN A CONVERSATION EITHER WITH THE HEAD LIFTED UP ON ONE SIDE OR STANDING WITH THE BODY LEANING BACK WARD WHERE THE OBJECT OF MIRTH IS PRESENT AND THERE IS ANOTHER FREQUENT ACTION THAT ATTENDS VEHE L 2 MENT76 MENT LAUGHTER WHICH IS LAYING THE HANDS ON EACH SIDE TO THE RIBS HOLDING THE SIDES AND IS CAUSED THUS THE UPPER PART OF THE DIAPHRAGM IS ATTACHED TO THE END OF THE CARTILAGO ENSIFORMIS AND TO THE CARTILAGES OF THE SEVENTH RIBS AND TO THE EDGES OF THE CARTILAGES OF ALL THE LOWER RIBS AND IN FINE TO THE BONY PART OF THE LAST AND THE LOWER PART TO THE VERTEBRAE OF THE LOINS FROM HENCE IT HAPPENS THAT WHEN LAUGHTER IS VIOLENT AND CONTINUED TOO LONG THE CONSTANT VELLICATION OF ALL THOSE PARTS FATIGUES THE PERSON AND CAUSES PAIN IN THE REGIONS OF THE PARTS MENTIOND THAT IS IN THE LOINS BREAST AND SIDES AND THIS IS THE REASON WHY WE ARE SO APT IN VIOLENT LAUGHTER TO HOLD OUR SIDES BREAST OR BACK

ENGAGING MANNER WHOSE CHARMING SONG IT WOULD BE UNPAR DONABLE TO CONCEAL SINCE NO LANGUAGE CAN BOAST OF ONE MORE EXPRESSIVE UPON THE SUBJECT AND WHEREIN HE HAS SHEWN THAT TEARS ARE A BLESSING PECULIAR ONLY TO HUMAN NATURE HOW80 HOW WISELY NATURE DID DECREE WITH THE SAME EYES TO WEEP AND SEE THAT HAVING VIEWD THE OBJECT VAIN WE MIGHT BE READY TO COMPLAIN AND SINCE THE SELFDELUDING SIGHT IN A FALSE ANGLE TAKES EACH HEIGHT THESE TEARS WHICH BETTER MEASURE ALL LIKE WATRY LINES AND PLUMMETS FALL I HAVE THRO EVRY GARDEN BEEN AMONG THE RED THE WHITE THE GREEN AND YET FROM ALL THE FLOWRS I SAW NO HONEY BUT THESE TEARS COULD DRAW SO THE ALLSEEING SUN EACH DAY DISTILS THE WORLD WITH CHYMIC RAY BUT FINDS THE ESSENCE ONLY SHOWRS WHICH STRAIT IN PITY BACK HE POURS SO MAGDALEN IN TEARS MORE WISE

ARE OFTEN TOO FORCED FROM THEIR RECESS BY NATURE TO EXPRESS AN OVERFLOWING JOY BUT THEN IT IS ACCIDENTAL OR CONSTITUTIONAL AND NOT A TRUE CHA RACTER OF JOY THE FIRST EFFORTS OF THE MIND TO RE JOICE IF MODERATE AND DELIBERATE CAUSE THE MOMEN TUM OF THE BLOOD TO INCREASE WITHOUT VIOLENCE AND THEN THERE IS NO INTERRUPTION TO THAT PLEASING TRANSITION OF THE MINDS DISPOSITION TO THE MUSCLES OF THE FACE NOR OF THEIR NATURAL CONFORMITY TO IT BUT WHEN THE JOY IS RECEIVED TOO SUDDENLY IT AMOUNTS TO A SHOCK WHEREBY THE BLOOD IS DRIVEN AT THE FIRST ONSET WITH GREATER VIOLENCE TO THE EXTREMITIES AND IN GREATER QUANTITY THAN CAN BE TIME ENOUGH BROUGHT BACK TO THE HEART WHENCE IT REMAINS TOO LONG CONTRACTED BEFORE THE VENA CAVA CAN SUPPLY BLOOD ENOUGH TO FORCE THE AURICLES AND VENTRICLES OPEN AGAIN WHILST IN THE MEAN TIME THE HEAD IS LOADEN WITH TOO GREAT A QUANTITY AND THE PERSON IN DANGER OF AN APO PLEXY OR SUDDEN DEATH IN SUCH A SURPRIZE AS THIS MENTIOND TEARS HAVE ANOTHER NOBLE USE FOR BY FLOWING PLENTIFULLY THRO THE LACRYMAL PASSAGES THE LIVES OF MANY HAVE BEEN SAVED FOR THEY LESSEN THE BULK OF HUMOURS AND GAIN TIME FOR THE MORE HAPPY RETURN OF THE MASS TO ITS NATURAL CIRCULATION AND AT LENGTH DRAW THE MUSCLES MENTIOND INTO CON SENT WHEREBY THIS SUDDEN JOY TERMINATES IN REAL WEEPING THUS IN VEHEMENT GRIEF TOO SHEDDING OF TEARS IN PLENTY IS KNOWN TO EASE THE ANXIETY USUALLY ATTENDING IT THE DIVINE SHAKESPEAR IN HIS ROMEO AND JULIET HAD A TRUE NOTION OF THIS KIND OF JOY WHERE HE SAYS M BACK82 BACK FOOLISH TEARS BACK TO YOUR NATIVE SPRING YOUR TRIBUTARY DROPS BELONG TO WOE

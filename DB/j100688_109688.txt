OTHER APPEARANCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE ABSTRACT,I207043,338 CONTINUATION OF EXPERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING THE CAUSE OF COLOURED CONCENTRIC RINGS AND OTHER APPEARANCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LLD FRS READ MARCH 23 1809 PHIL TRANS 1809 P 259 IN THE FORMER PART OF THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR HAD POINTED OUT VARIOUS METHODS OF PRODUCING COLOURED RINGS BETWEEN SURFACES IN CONTACT AND HAD PROVED THAT NO OTHER SURFACES ARE CONCERNED IN THEIR FORMATION AND HE NOW PROCEEDS TO SHOW THAT BY VARYING THE FIGURES OF THE SURFACES A CORRESPONDING CHANGE OF THE FORM OF THE RINGS WILL BE OB SERVED AS A SPHERICAL SURFACE APPLIED TO A PLANE SURFACE PRODUCES CIRCULAR RINGS SO WHEN IT IS APPLIED TO A CYLINDRICAL SURFACE THE RINGS BECOME ELLIPSES AND WHEN THE CYLINDER IS APPLIED TO A PLANE THE ELLIPSES BECOME STRAIGHT LINES AND IRREGULAR CURVES OCCASION IRRE GULARITY IN THE FORM OF THE RINGS BUT DR HERSCHEL IS OF OPINION THAT PLANE SURFACES APPLIED TO EACH OTHER AT ANY EXTREMELY SMALL ANGLE CANNOT EXHIBIT ANY SUCH APPEARANCES OF COLOUR UNLESS THEY ARE DIS FIGURED BY UNEQUAL PRESSURE THE AUTHOR NEXT EXAMINES THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PRISMATIC BLUE BOW OBSERVED BY NEWTON AS THE LIMIT TO THE PERFECT REFLECTION THAT OCCURS IN THE INTERIOR OF A PRISM WHEN LIGHT IS MUCH INCLINED TO ITS SURFACE AND DR HERSCHEL CALLS THIS THE CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE COLOURS HE ALSO EXAMINES THE PRISMATIC RED BOW OBSERVABLE AT THE SAME CRITICAL INCLINATION WHEN THE TRANSMITTED LIGHT PREVAILS OVER THAT WHICH IS REFLECTED AND REMARKS THE CHANGE FROM RED TO BLUE OCCA SIONED BY CHANGING THE DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT THE NEXT PHENOMENA OBSERVED ARE THE COLOURED STREAKS THAT ARE PRODUCED ADJACENT TO THESE BOWS WHEN THE REFLECTING SURFACE OF THE PRISM IS IN CONTACT WITH ANOTHER SURFACE THE STREAKS BEING STRAIGHT WHEN THE SURFACES ARE PLAIN OR CURVED ACCORDING TO THEIR DIFFERENT KIND OR DEGREE OF CURVATURE IN THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH FOLLOW THIS EFFECT OF A SURFACE IN CONTACT WITH THE PRISM IS EMPLOYED AS A CRITE RION FOR DISTINGUISHING MORE CLEARLY THE ACTING SURFACE VARIOUS MORE COMPLICATED APPEARANCES ARE NEXT EXAMINED IN WHICH BY REASON OF SECOND REFLECTION THE ORIGIN OF THE BOWS IS LESS DISTINCT OR IN WHICH TWO BOWS MAY BE SEEN AT ONCE FROM THE PARTI CULAR FORM OF THE PRISM IN THE FORMATION OF BOWS IT IS SHOWN THAT ONLY ONE SURFACE OF THE PRISM IS CONCERNED BY ROUGHENING OTHER SURFACES AND BY APPLYING TO THEM VARIOUS GLASSES WITHOUT PREVENTING THE APPEARANCE OF THE BOWS SINCE THE STREAKS WHICH ARE SEEN BENEATH THE BLUE BOW WHEN A PLANE SURFACE IS IN CONTACT WITH A PRISM CONTAIN ALL THE PRISMATIC COLOURS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE LESS REFRANGIBLE AFTER HAVING BEEN TRANSMITTED ARE REFLECTED BACK BY THE CONTIGUOUS SURFACE AND THEN REENTER THE PRISM DR HERSCHEL NEXT PROCEEDS TO DELINEATE FROM STRICT COMPUTATION THE COURSE OF THE SEVERAL RAYS AND BY A DIAGRAM DRAWN UPON AN ENLARGED SCALE SHOWS THAT WHEN LIGHT FALLS UPON A PAIR OF SURFACES NEARLY IN CONTACT AND WHEN SINGLE RAYS OR SMALL PENCILS ARE SEPARATED339 AT REGULAR INTERVALS FROM EACH OTHER THEN THE RAYS WHICH EMERGE AND AFTER REFLECTION REENTER THE SAME SURFACE WILL ALSO BE SEPARATED SO AS TO PRESENT STREAKY APPEARANCES IN SOME OF WHICH THE ORDER OF THE COLOURS WILL DIFFER FROM THAT IN OTHERS AGREEABLY TO OBSERVATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CURVATURE OF THE PRISMATIC BOWS THAT MANI FESTLY DEPENDS UPON THE POSITION OF THE EYE AS THE LINES OF EQUAL IN CIDENCE FORM A CONE OF WHICH THE EYE IS APEX AND ACCORDINGLY AS THE EYE RECEDES FROM THE PRISM THE BOW BECOMES LESS CURVED AND FOR A SMALL SPACE WILL APPEAR STRAIGHT DR HERSCHEL HAVING REMARKED WHEN A PLANE SURFACE IS APPLIED TO A PRISM THAT THE APPEARANCE OF THE STREAKS THAT ARE SEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE PRISMATIC BOW DEPENDS ON WHAT HE HAS TERMED THE CRITICAL SEPARATION OF THE RAYS INFERS THAT THOSE RINGS OF COLOURS WHICH ARE SEEN WHEN A LENS IS LAID UPON A PLANE SURFACE DEPEND ALSO UPON THE SAME CRITICAL SEPARATION THE LENS BEING IN THIS CASE CONSIDERED AS A PRISM BENT ROUND INTO A CIRCULAR FORM THE SEVERAL POINTS OF RESEMBLANCE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE BOWSTREAKS FROM A PRISM AND THE RINGS FROM CONTACT OF LENSES APPEAR OR DISAPPEAR OR CHANGE THEIR FORM OR THEIR COLOURS ARE NEXT COMPARED AND ARE CONSIDERED BY THE AUTHOR AS DECISIVE PROOF THAT EACH ARISE FROM THE SAME CRITICAL SEPARATION AT THE BOUNDARY OF PRISMATIC REFLECTION AND IF THE MERE DIFFERENCE OF REFRANGIBILITY OF THE SEVERAL COLOURS IS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENA IT IS INFERRED THAT NO ALTERNATE FITS OF EASY REFLECTION AND EASY TRANSMIS SION REALLY EXIST AS ORIGINAL PROPERTIES IN THE RAYS OF LIGHT AN ACCOUNT OF A CALCULUS FROM THE HUMAN BLADDER OF UNCOMMON MAG NITUDE BY SIR JAMES EARLE FRS READ JUNE 15 1809 PHIL TRANS 1809 P 303 THIS CALCULUS WHICH IS CONSIDERED AS THE LARGEST ON RECORD WEIGHS 44 OUNCES AVOIRDUPOIS IT WAS TAKEN AFTER DEATH FROM THE BLADDER OF SIR JAMES OGILVIE WHO HAD SUBMITTED TO A FRUITLESS ATTEMPT TO REMOVE IT BY THE USUAL OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY RATHER THAN PROLONG AN EXISTENCE EXTREMELY MISERABLE FROM THIS AMONG OTHER CONSE QUENCES OF A BLOW ON HIS BACK THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE STONE SO COMPLETELY FILLED THE CAVITY OF THE BLADDER THAT IT WAS WITH DIFFICULTY TAKEN OUT ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NO REAL ADHESION ITS TEXTURE WAS LESS COMPACT THAN THAT OF CALCULI IN GENERAL BUT AGREED IN APPEAR ANCE WITH THAT SPECIES WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED THE FUSIBLE CALCULUS AND IT WAS ASCERTAINED BY DR POWEL TO CONTAIN THE SAME INGREDIENTS AS IT WAS COMPOSED OF THE AMMONIACAL PHOSPHATE OF MAGNESIA WITH PHOSPHATE OF LIME

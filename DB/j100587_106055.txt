SKETCH OF THE SIGNS OF THE ZODIAC FOUND IN A PAGODA NEAR CAPE COMORIN IN INDIA S I R AS A MEMBER OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND ONE WHOSE STUDY IS PARTICULARLY DIRECTED TO THE MOTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES I THINK YOU THE MOST PROPER PERSON TO WHOM I CAN SEND THE INCLOSED SKETCH TAB X WHICH I DREW WITH A PENCIL AS I LAY ON MY BACK RESTING MYSELF DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY IN A JOURNEY FROM MA DURAH TO TWINWELLY NEAR CAPE COMORIN AND I SEND IT TO YOU RATHER IN THE ORIGINAL AS I THEN SKETCHED IT OFF THAN IN ANY MORE COMPLETE FORM LEST IT SHOULD THEREBY HAVE MORE THE APPEARANCE OF COMPOSITION AND LEAVE NOT SO STRONG AN IM PRESSION OF ANTIQUITY AS IT MADE ON ME WHEN I DIS COVERED IT READ MAY 14 1772 AFTER SUCH A DISCOVERY I SEARCHED IN MY TRAVELS MANY OTHER PAGODAS OR CHOULTRYS FOR SIMILAR CARVINGS BUT TO THE BEST OF MY REMEMBRANCE NEVER FOUND VOL LXII Z Z BUT354 BUT ONE MORE EQUALLY COMPLETE WHICH WAS ON THE CEILING OF A TEMPLE IN THE MIDDLE OF A TANK BEFORE THE PAGODA OF TEPPECOLUM NEAR MINDURAH OF WHICH TANK AND TEMPLE MR WARD PAINTER IN BROAD STREET NEAR CARNABYMARKET HATH A DRAWING BUT I HAVE OFTEN MET WITH THE SEVERAL PARTS IN DETACHED PIECES FROM THE CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SIGNS OF THE ZO DIAC WHICH WE AT PRESENT USE AND WHICH WE HAD I BELIEVE FROM THE ARABIANS OR EGYPTIANS I AM APT TO THINK THAT THEY ORIGINALLY CAME FROM INDIA AND WERE IN USE AMONG THE BRAMINS WHEN ZOROASTER AND PYTHAGORAS TRAVELLED THITHER AND CONSEQUENTLY ADOPTED AND USED BY THOSE TRAVELLERS AND AS THESE PHILOSOPHERS ARE STILL SPOKEN OF IN INDIA UNDER THE NAMES OF ZERDHURST AND PYTTAGORE I SHOULD ALSO HAZARD ANOTHER IDEA THAT THE WORSHIP OF THE COW WHICH STILL PREVAILS IN INDIA WAS TRANSPLANTED FROM THENCE TO EGYPT BUT THIS IS ONLY CONJECTURE AND IT MAY WITH ALMOST EQUAL PROBABILITY BE SAID THAT ZOROASTER OR PYTHAGORAS CARRIED THAT WORSHIP TO INDIA HOWEVER I THINK THERE IS AN ARGUMENT STILL IN FA VOUR OF INDIA FOR ITS ANTIQUITY IN POINT OF CIVILIZATION AND CULTIVATION OF THE ARTS AND SCIENCES FOR IT IS HARDLY IN DISPUTE THAT ALL THESE IMPROVEMENTS CAME FROM THE EAST TO THE WEST AND IF WE MAY BE AL LOWED TO DRAW ANY CONCLUSIONS FROM THE IMMENSE BUILDINGS NOW EXISTING AND FROM THE LITTLE OF THE INSCRIPTIONS WHICH CAN BE INTERPRETED ON SEVERAL OF THE CHOULTRYS AND PAGODAS I THINK IT MAY SAFELY BE PRONOUNCED THAT NO PART OF THE WORLD HAS MORE MARKS OF ANTIQUITY FOR ARTS SCIENCES AND CIVILIZA TION355 TION THAN THE PENINSULA OF INDIA FROM THE GANGES TO CAPE COMORIN NOR IS THERE IN THE WORLD A FINER CLIMATE OR FACE OF THE COUNTRY NOR A SPOT BETTER INHABITED OR FILLED WITH TOWNS TEMPLES AND VIL LAGES THAN THIS SPACE IS THROUGHOUT IF CHINA AND PARTS OF EUROPE ARE EXCEPTED I THINK THE CARVINGS ON SOME OF THE PAGODAS AND CHOULTRYS AS WELL AS THE GRANDEUR OF THE WORK EX CEEDS ANY THING EXECUTED NOWADAYS NOT ONLY FOR THE DELICACY OF THE CHISSEL BUT THE EXPENCE OF CON STRUCTION CONSIDERING IN MANY INSTANCES TO WHAT DISTANCES THE COMPONENT PARTS WERE CARRIED AND TO WHAT HEIGHTS RAISED IF MR KITTLE THE PAINTER NOW IN INDIA SHOULD HAVE TIME AND OPPORTUNITY AFTER HE HATH MADE HIS FORTUNE BY PORTRAIT DRAWING IT WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO HIS REPUTATION AND WELL WORTH HIS PAINS TO INVESTIGATE THE NATURE OF THE INDIAN ARCHI TECTURE AND CARVING BY PAINTING SOME OF THE MOST CURIOUS BUILDINGS OR PARTS OF PAGODAS THE GREAT OBSTACLE TO ASCERTAINING DATES OR HISTORICAL EVENTS IS THE LOSS OF THE SANSSKIRRIT LANGUAGE AND THE CONFINE MENT OF IT TO THE PRIESTHOOD I SHOULD HAVE TAKEN SOME PAINS TO HAVE COLLECTED MANY THINGS BUT THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS AND OCCUPATIONS WHICH HAP PENED ALWAYS PREVENTED ME I ALSO COMMIT TO YOUR INSPECTION THE  MANUSCRIPTS OF MR ROBINS WHICH HE GAVE ME AT HIS DEATH  THESE I COMMUNICATED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY TOGETHER WITH THIS LETTER BUT BEING EXAMINED BY MYSELF MR RAPER MR CAVENDISH AND MR HORSLEY AT THE DESIRE OF THE SOCIETY THEY WERE NOT FOUND TO CONTAIN ANY THING MATERIAL MORE THAN HAS BEEN ALREADY PRINTED EXCEPTING A TREATISE ON MILITARY DISCIPLINE WHICH IF IT SHOULD BE THOUGHT OF USE MAY BE INSERTED IN THE NEXT EDITION OF HIS WORKS N M Z Z 2 I BE356 I BELIEVE MOST OF THEM HAVE BEEN PRINTED BUT IF THERE ARE ANY WHICH HAVE NOT OR THAT CAN AMUSE YOU OR INSTRUCT OTHERS YOU ARE WELCOME TO USE THEM AS YOU PLEASE I ONLY WISH THEY MAY CONTAIN ANY THING USEFUL WHILE HE LIVED I PURSUED THOSE STU DIES BUT SOON AFTER HIS DEATH NEW SCENES AROSE AND ENGAGED ME MORE IN PRACTICAL SERVICE THAN AL LOWED ME TIME FOR THEORY OR EXPERIMENTS I AM HOWEVER A CONSTANT WELLWISHER TO THE PROGRESS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES AS WELL AS STUDY AND VERY MUCH S I R YOUR OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT JNO CALL XXV AN

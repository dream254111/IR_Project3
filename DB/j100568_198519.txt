2 THE QUESTIONS SETTLED BY THE AWARD OF THE ALASKAN BOUNDARY TRIBUNAL AN ADDRESS BEFORE THE AMERICAN GEOGRAPHICAL SOCIETY JANUARY 19 1904 BY ROBERT LANSING Map page 128 It is my purpose this evening to give a general outline of the origin course and termination of the Alaskan Boundary Contro versy Undoubtedly in attempting so comprehensive a treatment I shall have to pass over ground more or less familiar to many of you but I shall do so as briefly as possible touching only upon the salient featuresthose actually necessary to explain the meaning and purpose of the questions submitted to the Tribunal which met at London last September It will be of material aid to a better understanding of the sub ject if you will bear in mind two facts which will appear more clearly as we proceed First the real questioni at issue between the United States and Great Britain was whether or not Canada should obtain a seaport on the Pacific Coast in the region which has been known as Southeast Alaska And second the questions submitted to the Tribunal were of greater or less importance as they affected this underlying issue It was on the 3oth day of March 1867 at four oclock in the morning that Secretary Seward and the Russian Minister at Wash ington signed the convention which ceded Russian America to the United States The evening before the Czars representative had received a cablegram from his Government authorizing him to accept the seven million two hundred thousand dollars offered by Secre tary Seward for the territory Without delay the treaty was drafted and before dawn was formally signed 65The Questions Settled by the Award of the Under the guidance of Senator Sumner who had been informed of the proposed purchase shortly after the arrival of the message from St Petersburg and who had promised the Secretary of State and the Russian Minister to support the measure in the Senate the treaty received on May 28th the almost unanimous approval of that body On June 2oth the ratifications were exchanged at Washington and the same day the treaty by Presidential procla mation became the law of the land Thus the United States secured its title deed to the Russian possessions in America thence forth to be known as the Territory of Alaska This vast acquisition to our national domain embraces over 575000 square miles and has a coast line exceeding that of the Atlantic States Its eastern boundary may be conveniently divided into two sections That to the north of Mount St Elias follows the I4ist meridian of west longitude to the Arctic Ocean Its location upon the ground at certain points has been determined by astro nomical observations The section southeast of St Elias extends in a winding course at a short distance inland from the coast as far south as the Portland Canal which it follows to the ocean and thence runs westerly to the southern point of Prince of Wales Island in latitude 54 40 It is the location of this latter portion of the boundary which has been in dispute between the United States and Great Britain The narrow coastal strip between this boundary and the sea is known commonly by its treaty name as the Lisiere  that is the borderor selvage of the continent It is approximately 650 miles long and has generally been drawn with a uniform width of 30 marine miles measuring inland from tidewater The portion east and south of Cross Sound is faced by an extensive archipelago the islands forming it being separated by innumerable narrow straits and channels The coast of the lisiere is indented with many deep and winding fiords known locally as canals from whose high and precipitous shores numerous glaciers flow down toward the sea Inland the lisiere is a great mountain mass gashed with deep ravines and gorges forming hundreds of short ridges which have no common trend but intersect each other in inextricable confusion The region which has been aptly termed a sea of mountains and a jumble of mountains is covered with the snow of ages through which at intervals pierce black masses of jagged rock breaking the monotonous whiteness of the scenery but intensifying its barrenness Lifeless bleak and forbidding this waste of snow and ice and crag stretches back from the coast as far as man has 66Alaskan Boundary Tribunal penetrated The character of this region explains why the bound ary of Southeast Alaska has never been actually laid down upon the ground Along the upper portion of the lisiere the mountains are less con fused A short distance north of Lynn Canal a clearlydefined range divides the watershed of the upper Yukon from the small rivers flowing south It is through these mountains that the Chil kat Chilkoot and White Passes giveaccess to the gold fields of the Klondike Then from Mount Fairweather which rises a few miles to the northwest of Cross Sound a chain of lofty mountains which reach an altitude of over o0000 feet extends along the coast to the towering peak of St Elias  the silent Sentinel Which garbed in its eternal white Keeps endless vigil oer the slumbering North On account of the ruggedness of the shores nearly all of the rivers of the lisire are mere torrents which rise within a few miles of the ocean Fourthe Stikine Taku Chilkat and Alsekflow across the inland boundary The Stikine is navigable for light draught steamers for I50 miles the others can be ascended only in canoes Except by these four rivers and the passes north of Lynn Canal the impenetrability of the mountain fastnesses prevents access to the interior On October i8 1867 the formal transfer of the territory took place at Sitka which is situated on the western coast of Baranof Island A military government was established which continued until I877 when the authority passed to the Navy Department In 1884 under an act of Congress the present civil government was organized During the thirty years succeeding the cession the marking of the boundary of Southeast Alaska formed the subject of frequent negotiations between the United States and Great Britain but the difficulties and expense which a survey would entail were constant obstacles to the undertaking although the importance of the Stikine River as a route to the goldbearing Cassiar District of British Columbia the discovery of gold in the neighbourhood of Lynn Canal and the exploration of the mountain passes near its head made more apparent each year the necessity of laying down the boundary At first the line usually shown upon the maps had been accepted in the United States Great Britain and Canada as being approxi mately correct but with the growing importance of the possession 67The Questions Settled by the Award af the of the head of Lynn Canal the description in the AngloRussian treaty of 1825 by which the boundary had been established and which had been repeated verbatim in the treaty of 1867 received considerable attention in Canada particularly in British Columbia Certain ambiguities and uncertainties of language were foundwhich were seized upon as the basis for a new interpretation of the treaty by which the line would be drawn across Lynn Canal placing the upper portion within the British possessions While this theory for years was not openly accepted by the British Government it found many advocates throughout the Dominion and finally during the sessions of the Joint High Commission in 1898 the British Commissioners advanced it as a correct construction of the treaty description Prior to the issue being definitely raised in regard to the mean ing of the treaty the United States and Great Britain had in 1893 and 1894 made a joint survey of the coast of the lisiere which although furnishing valuable data for the final determination of the controversy brought the matter no nearer settlement The dis covery of the Klondike gold fields in 1896 was followed by the rush of thousands into the region the large majority entering by way of the mountain passes near Lynn Canal With the boundary un determined there was considerable friction and conflict of authority between the American and Canadian officials charged with the en forcement of the laws and the preservation of order A settlement of their respective jurisdictions became imperative and so upon the failure of the Joint High Commission to reach an agreement the two Governments entered into a modus vivendi establishing a provisional line on the routes between Lynn Canal and the head waters of the Yukon This line which was marked upon the ground in 1899 lies much nearer the sea than the boundary fixed by the recent award The temporary arrangement as to jurisdictional limits though relieving a most undesirable condition was satisfactory to neither Government and finally after four years more of negotiation a treaty was signed on January 24 1903 submitting the questions at issue to the Tribunal which recently met at London ahd by its award ended the controversy which has been a cause of much bitter ness between the United States and Canada and an obstacle to the settlement of other differences between the two countries The questions which the treaty presented to the Tribunal for its adjudication were seven in number and involved the true intent and meaning of the description of the boundary as set forth in 68Alaskan Boundary Tribunal Articles III and IV of the AngloRussian treaty of 1825 Without giving the exact language these Articles may be thus stated The line was to begin at the southernmost point of Prince of Wales Island in latitude 54 40 and ascend northerly along Portland Channel to the 56th parallel of latitude from which point it was to follow the crest of the mountains situated parallel to the coast as far as the I4Ist meridian of longitude west of Greenwich which meridian was to form the boundary northward as far as the Frozen Ocean It was further provided that wherever the crest of the mountains extending parallel to the coast should prove to be more than ten marine leagues approximately 342 statute miles from the ocean then the line should run parallel to the sinuosities of the coast but never more than ten marine leagues therefrom The questions submitted to the Tribunal and the answers which each Government claimed should be made to them are briefly as follows The first question was What point is the beginning of the line Both parties asked that the answer be  Cape Muzon The second question What channel is the Portland Channel The United States claimed that it was the broad arm of the sea known for fifty years as  Portland Inlet and its northern branch which is named on all maps Portland Canal Great Britain agreed that Portland Canal was the upper part of the channel but asserted that the narrow passage north of Portland Inlet now called Pearse Inlet was the lower portion The difference involved the title to onehalf of Portland Inlet and the islands along its northern side The third question asked was What course the line should take between the place of beginning and Portland Channel Both countries claimed that it should be a straight line The fourth question To what point on the 56th parallel should the line be drawn from the head of Portland Channel and what course should it follow between these points This question was made necessary from the fact that although the treaty of 1825 appeared to assume that the 56th parallel crossed Portland Channel it in reality lay some distance north of its head The United States asked that the line on reaching the mainland should be con tinued on the same course to the parallel a distance of about 5fr miles Great Britain claimed that the point on the parallel to which the line should be drawn was where it was intersected by the mountains which were under the treaty to form the boundary northward of that parallel 69The Questions Settled by the Award of the The fifth questionand the one of greatest importancewas this Was it the intention and meaning of the treaty of 1825 that Russia should have a continuous strip or fringe of coast on the mainland extending from the 56th parallel to the I41st meridian and separating the British possessions from salt water at every point The United States asked for an affirmative answer Great Britain for a negative one The sixth question the language of which is rather obscure was contingent upon the answer made to the fifth question As the contingency did not arise and the Tribunal declared an answer was unnecessary we need not consider it The seventh and last question was What mountains if any exist are those which parallel the coast and form the boundary north of 560 when not more than ten marine leagues from the ocean The United States asked the Tribunal to decide that there was no continuous range of mountains within ten leagues of the ocean such as was intended by the treaty Great Britain claimed that such mountains did exist and that they were those which rose immediately from the waters edge Upon the map facing page 128 the British line is the one run ning very close to the outer shores of the mainland It will be seen to cross all the large bays and inlets The next line inland is the one of the Award The line furthermost inland which winds around all the indentations of the coast and never approaches nearer than within ten marine leagues of tidewater was not directly claimed by the United States but was laid down as a guide to the Tribunal in determining the line provided no mount ains were found to meet the provisions of the treaty It was necessary for Great Britain to establish three proposi tions in order to obtain the line which she claimed First that it was not intended by the treaty that Russia should have a continu ous strip of land along the coast Second that the mountains re ferred to in the treaty did exist And third that the particular mountains of the British line fulfilled the treaty provisions The failure to establish any one of these propositions would break down the theory upon which the line was constructed and the failure of the first which depended on the answer made to the fifth question would destroy it utterly It is apparent therefore that the very heart of the controversy lay in the fifth question which may be thus stated Did the boundary run around all arms of the sea without touching any of them While the other questions were largely a matter of geographical 70Alaskan Boundary Tribunal fact this question was one of the intention of the parties and the meaning of the treaty The chief source for determining these was the negotiations which led up to the treaty of I825 They extended over a period of three and onehalf years and are fully detailed in the voliminous correspondence which was laid before the Tribunal Time will permit only a brief reference to this im portant branch of the evidence The negotiations originated in an imperial ukase promulgated by the Czar in September I821 by which he prohibited all persons from approaching within ioo Italian miles of the coasts and islands of Northwest America as far south as Vancouvers Island in lati tude 51 north The object of this ukase was to preserve to the Russian American Company a corporation which had been granted the exclusive rights of government colonization and trade through out the Czars American possessions its monopoly of the fur trade which had been seriously menaced by American trading vessels which frequented the region in constantly increasing numbers The United States and Great Britain upon being advised of this assertion of extraordinary jurisdiction over the high seas entered vigorous protests which resulted in a suspension of the edict until the rights of the parties could be determined by treaty The grounds of protest were two first that the extension of municipal authority beyond three miles from the coast was contrary to the practice of nations and second that Russias claim of territory rested upon no valid title The freedom of navigation was of equal interest to the protesting Powers the limitation of Russian territory to Great Britain in particular The Hudsons Bay Company had crossed the Rocky Mountains and though still 70 miles from the ocean it had several stations between 53 and 55 of north latitude The possibility of water communication between the Pacific and the British trading posts in the interior and of the establishment of a station upon the coast for the transshipment of furs and supplies made it desirable for Great Britain to prevent Russia from extending her dominion south and east On the other hand it was necessary for Russia in order to safeguard the monopoly of the Russian American Com pany to prevent the erection of rival trading posts on the islands or adjacent mainland to which the natives could resort and from which foreign traders could operate This was the prime object of the Russians throughout the negotiations At the outset Russia abandoning her claims south of Dixon Entrance proposed that the boundary should run through Port 71The Questions Settled by the Award of the land Channel and thence follow the mountains extending parallel to the sinuosities of the coast as far as the I39th meridian Great Britain attempted by several counter proposals to obtain conces sions which would insure to her subjects a foothold upon the coast north of Dixon Entrance but Russia remained firm in her demands only modifying them to the extent of limiting the width of the lisiere to ten marine leagues when the mountains were further than that distance from the coast and to changing the i39th to the I41st meridian Great Britain finally assented and the treaty was signed on the last day of February 1825 It is evident that a most important question in determining the intent of the parties was To what mountains did the Russian pleni potentiaries refer in the negotiations The only thing that the correspondence shows is that the negotiators took it for granted that a mountain range paralleled the coast There is nothing fur ther to identify it As there were no published descriptions of the regions inland this belief must have originated from examining maps and so the maps consulted by the negotiators were most material in determining these mountains and through their loca tion the intention of the parties as to the course of the boundary It was established with approximate certainty before the London Tribunal that these maps were those of the British explorer Cap tain George Vancouver a map issued in 1802 by the Russian Quar termasterGenerals department and a map published by James Wyld at London in 1823 known as the Faden Map Certain coincidents exist between the  Faden Map and state ments in the correspondence which prove almost beyond contro versy that it was the one chiefly relied upon by the negotiators On all these maps appears an unbroken chain of mountains winding around the indentations of the coast at a short distance from salt water and extending from Portland Canal to Mount St Elias The United States claimed that these maps were conclusive evidence of the mountains of which the Russians spoke Great Britain claimed on the contrary that the negotiators must have known that the maps were uncertain and that they did not rely upon them to locate the mountains but left that for future survey The agreement as to the limitation of the extreme width of the lisiere to ten marine leagues introduced another factor into the problem of locating the boundary It was this From what points should the limit be measured inland in case the mountains were not within that distance The treaty in one place says the ocean in another  the sinuosities of the coast Both parties 72Alaskan Boundary Tribunal agreed before the Tribunal that the two terms were synonymous But what did the negotiators intend by the words  ocean and coast If no mountains such as the treaty presumed were found to exist then the location of the boundary hinged on the interpretation given to these words Great Britain contended that coast in the treaty meant  the general trend of the coast and that in drawing the coastline all inlets not exceeding six miles in width should be ignored The United States denied this contention and asserted that an artificial coastline such as Great Britain urged was never em ployed except to determine the extent of municipal jurisdiction over adjacent waters that no instance could be cited in which it was used for fixing a boundary and that in any event since the artificialor more correctly the politicalcoast of Southeast Alaska left the mainland at Cross Sound and passed outside the entire archipelago before again touching the continent it could not have been the one intended in the treaty  The American con tention was that the coast from which the tenleague limit should be measured was the physical coastline of the mainlandthat is the dividing line between land and water and that such a coast followed the shores of every inlet without regard to its length or breadth It was urged that what Russia sought throughout the negotia tions was to obtain a land barrier which would prevent British traders from making settlements on the shores along which the Russian Company traded and that if the plenipotentiaries of Russia had based the tenleague limit upon a coastline which would leave the heads of all the principal inlets within the British dominions they would have entirely failed in the chief object sought by them while manifestly from the history of the negotia tions they had been successful Furthermore the language of the treaty was  the sinuosities of the coast not  coast alone and the word sinuosities could not be ignored and could only refer to the bays and inlets In addition to these points the United States directed the atten tion of the Tribunal to the maps consulted by the negotiators pointing out that the chain of mountains shown on them paralleled the physical coastline and not the general trend of the coast and that this proved the character of the coast referred to in the treaty Thus it was argued from the common and usual meaning of the word  coast that the mountain boundary was to pass around the 73The Questions Settled by the Award of the heads of the inlets and conversely from the fact that the chain of mountains on the maps did pass around the inlets the word coast was used in its common geographical sense A large mass of evidence was also laid before the Tribunal showing that subsequent to the treaty both Russia and Great Britain recognized the boundary as running along the coast with out touching the shores at any point Time will not permit a review of this class of evidence which consisted of a great number of maps and charts and numerous documents proving acts of sove reignty at the heads of the inlets by Russia and the United States and the recognition of such sovereignty by British and Canadian authorities The maps of Alaska which prior to the meetings of the Bound ary Tribunal had been so largely relied upon by American writers as furnishing conclusive evidence of the actual location of the boundary were never so considered by the Tribunal nor by the American counsel In those emanating from official sources in Russia England or Canada which were the only ones of value as evidence of the intention of the parties to the treaty the discrep ancies were too great to attempt to prove by them more than that the parties understood the treaty to mean that the line should never touch salt water between Portland Canal and Mount St Elias The occupation of the lisiere by Russia and after the cession by the United States particularly at the head of Lynn Canal was proved to be as full and complete as the nature of the country permitted and to this occupation Great Britain made neither pro test nor objection thus tacitly acquiescing in the interpretation placed upon the treaty by Russia and this country until the dis covery of gold along the upper Yukon made the ownership of the head of Lynn Canal of much moment to her Canadian subjects How much weight was given to the evidence which related to the acts of the parties subsequent to the treaty it is impossible to say but it could hardly have failed to impress the minds of the Commissioners with the equity of the United States case Yet there seems little doubt but that the Tribunal relied chiefly for its decision upon the language of the treaty interpreted by the pre ceding negotiations By that decision the fifth question was answered as the United States claimed it should be in the affirma tive The boundary was to be drawn around and not across the inlets Having found the intention of the treaty Powers as to the loca 74Alaskan Boundary Tribunal tion of the boundary in its relation to the inlets it was necessary for the Tribunal to answer the seventh question and determine whether there were any mountains in that locality which met the requirements of the treaty and if so what the mountains were The treaty phrase to be interpreted was la crete des montagnes This would seem to indicate a chain of mountains such as appeared upon the maps before the negotiators As a matter of fact how ever no such clearlydefined chain exists Both parties agreed as to that Still about the head of Lynn Canal and between Mount Fairweather and Mount St Elias there are dominant mountain ridges which practically if not technically fulfil the terms of the treaty As to the remainder of the line it was contended on behalf of the United States that since it was admitted that there was no con tinuous dominant range the Tribunal must fall back on the alterna tive boundary provided for by the treaty and fix the line at a uni form distance of ten marine leagues from the coast Great Britain on the contrary declared that la crete des montagnes  did not in dicate the crest of a range but meant simply the tops of the mount ains which rose nearest the coastthat is the general trend of the coast Relying upon this interpretation the British counsel claimed that the boundary should be drawn as shown upon the map When however the Tribunal decided that it was the intention of the treaty that the boundary should pass around the heads of the inlets the proposed British line became impossible Nevertheless the British contention that there were mountains which fulfilled the treaty stipulations without forming a continuous range pre vailed Since the United States had denied this proposition and Great Britains mountain boundary was out of the question the Commissioners reached a decision upon the seventh question for which neither Government had contended The middle line upon the map to which reference has been made shows the mountains selected by the Tribunal as meeting the requirements of the treaty There is nothing to indicate upon what theory or system these particular peaks and short ridges were chosen but a comparison of this line with the mountain range upon the maps before the negotiators discloses that the boundary as finally settled follows very closely the trend of that fictitious range particularly as shown on the Faden Map Another noticeable fact is that the boundary of the Award follows along the outer margin of the surveyed portion of the coast Either of these cir cumstances may be significant of the method employed in reaching 75The Questions Settled by the Award of the a decision and yet both may be mere coincidents and nothing7 more There is a portion of the mountain boundary which the Tribunal left unsettled It lies between two peaks 125 miles apart One rises a little north of the Stikine River the other north of the Taku They are connected on the map by a dotted straight line Of this section the Award says  In the absence of further sur vey the evidence is not sufficient to enable the Tribunal to say which are the mountains parallel to the coast within the meaning of the Treaty The question next in importance to the fifth and seventh was the second  What channel is the Portland Channel  Two dis tinct channels connect the long narrow fiord of Portland Canal proper with the ocean The small one to the north of Wales and Pearse Islands is called  Pearse Inlet the large one south of the islands has been known for a long period as  Portland Inlet though named on the accompanying map  Portland Canal The United States asserted that the broad channel was the c Portland Channel  of the treaty while Great Britain claimed that it was the narrow one The portion north of the eastern end of Pearse Island was conceded by both parties to be a part of  Port land Channel Near the entrance to Portland Inlet on the south ern side is Port Simpson which is to be the terminus of the pro posed extension of the Canadian railway system As a result the islands along the northern side of the inlet were considered by the Dominion Government of exceptional strategic importance But for this fact the second question would have been of little moment as the amount of territory involved was inconsiderable In favour of the British contention as to the location of  Port land Channel  there was substantially no doubt that Vancouver gave that name to the smaller channel and the name of  Obser vatory Inlet  to the larger This was not shown on his chart but his Narrative was explicit in so designating them The United States on its side argued that there was no evi dence that any of the negotiators ever saw or read the narrative of Vancouver and that the probability was that they relied solely uporn the maps in drafting the treaty and did not in any event trace out the intricate boat journey made by Vancouver through these waters which was the only way in which it could be determined what channel he named  Portland Another important point in the argument of the United States was that in the RussianAmerican treaty of I824 which was nego 76Alaskan Boundary Tribunal tiated at the same time that Great Britain was attempting to agree with Russia upon a boundary the southern limit of the latters pos sessions was along the parallel of 54 40 The entrance to Port land Inlet was shown to be exactly in that latitude From this coin cidence it was argued that the parallel pointed to the broad channel as the one which the line should follow for it seemed probable that Russia intended to have her southern boundary the same in both treaties In fact throughout the AngloRussian negotiations of MAP OF PORTLAND CHANNEL EXPLANATION The line of dots and dashes is the boundary claimed by the United States the line of short dashes is the boundary claimed by Great Britain and the solid line is the boundary fixed by the Award 1824 there was constant reference to 54 40 as the southern line of the Russian possessions However convincing such reasoning seems the presumption that the negotiators carefully perused Vancouvers Narrative which had had a wide circulation in both English and French editionsand was the only authority upon the region was too strong to be over 778The Questions Settled by the Award of the come Such at least was the opinion of the Tribunal for it decided that the narrow northern channel was intended in the treaty by the name  Portland Channel An examination of the map will show that Pearse Inlet has two outlets to the oceanone north of Sitklan and Kanagunut Islands the other and much the larger between Wales and Sit klan Islands Vancouver in his explorations passed through neither of these passages It was impossible from his narrative to tell which one he named Portland Channel The legal pre sumption in such a case would be that the larger one was intended Great Britain had drawn her proposed line through the narrow one north of Kanagunut and Sitklan but had failed to support it by any evidence The Tribunal therefore had no other course but to decide in favour of the larger channel known as Tongass Passage By this decision Great Britain obtained the islands Pearse and Wales and the United States Sitklan and Kana gunut While the award as a whole was received in Canada with dissatisfaction this particular part of it aroused much harsh criticism which was entirely unwarranted Great Britain obtained the two large islands in spite of opposing evidence on the presump tion that the negotiators had read Vancouvers narrative The United States obtained the two seaward islands on the presump tion that the explorer intended to name the larger opening into the ocean Portland Channel and to this conclusion there was no contrary evidence Certainly the Commissioners showed no par tiality to the United States in applying the principle of legal pre sumption It remains to refer briefly to that portion of the boundary lying between the head of Portland Canal and the 56th parallel of lati tude I have already stated the contention of the two Govern ments The Commissioners seem to have followed the principle urged by Great Britain that the point to be attained on the 56th parallel was where the mountains of the boundary intersected it So the line instead of following the valley of the Bear River as contended for by the United States was drawn along the ridge of the Reverdy Mountains a mile or two west of it Thus while Great Britain succeeded in theory the United States secured substantially all the territory that it claimed To recapitulate As to two of the seven questions namely the first and third there was no controversy One other the sixth required no answer The second relating to Portland Channel was 78Alaskan Boundary Tribunal decided in favour of Great Britain but her claim was so modified as to deprive her of the principal benefits sought The fourth which pertained to the drawing of the line between the head of Portland Canal and the 56th parallel was to all intents decided as the United States claimed that it should be The fifth and pivotal question concerning the relation of the boundary north of the 56th parallel to the inlets was answered precisely as the United States asked the Tribunal to find The seventh question which related to the existence and location of the mountains referred to in the treaty was decided in favour of Great Britain in principle but on account of the answer given to the fifth question its prac tical application was favourable to the United States The result of the Tribunals labours should be most gratifying toc this country not so much on account of what was secured under the Award as that it has brought to an amicable conclusion a controversy which has been an increasing cause of discord between the United States and Canada From a mere question as to the most convenient mode of marking a boundary line upon the ground it had grown to be the chief subject of dispute over shadowing all other matters of disagreement between the two countries and barring the way to their settlement Public opinion on either side of our northern frontier was hardening into a stub born and unreasoning belief that there was neither justice nor equity in the claims of the other nation When therefore the terms of the HayHerbert Treaty were made public a very pessi mistic view was taken of what it would or could accomplish The Tribunal created by the treaty was unique in constitution being composed of an equal number of members from each country without a foreign umpire to cast a deciding vote It was constantly asked How could a Tribunal so constituted ever reach an agree ment upon questions affecting the material interests of both coun tries  It might benefit future negotiations by securing a full presentation of the claims of each nation That it would do more than that seemed very doubtful This I believe was the general and not unreasonable opinion Too often unfortunately for the cause of international arbitration political motives rather than principles of justice have influenced the decisions of international courts even when presided over by a third party Compromise and concession legitimate instruments of diplomacy but never of judicial tribunals have been the foundation of many an interna tional award If these two modes of reaching an agreement could be eradicated much of the remaining opposition to the arbitration 79so The Questions Settled by the Award 5c of disputes between nations would disappear They are the chief stumblingblocks to its progress The Alaskan Boundary Tribunal has done much to remove these objections It has done more than appeals and arguments can do to arouse a favourable public sentiment and establish public confi dence in the judicial determination of international controversies It has proved that the deep sense of justice inherent in the Anglo Saxon race can rise above national prejudice and the influence of national interest It has paved the way for a general arbitration treaty between the United States and Great Britain which must soon become an accomplished fact To each member of that Tribunal honour in full measure is due for the determination so constantly manifested throughout their sessions to decide the questions submitted to them upon the weight of evidence and in strict accord with principles of justice That the decision was not unanimous is no cause to impute to the two Commissioners who declined to sign the Award any motive for their act other than a firm conviction that it was not equitable in all its findings Imputations such as have been made in some quarters reflect most unjustly upon the high character of the distinguished members who failed to agree with their colleagues while denying to them that right of independent judgment which is as essential to international as to national judges It would seem to me inappropriate to close without paying a special tribute to the great English jurist who presided over the sessions at London Tactful considerate and eminently fair to all he prevented the occurrence of any unpleasant incidents during the heat of debate such as have often in the past marred the dig nity of international commissions His name long known and honoured by the bench and bar of both countries has become the synonym throughout the length and breadth of this Republic for impartial and uncompromising justice Lord Alverstone as Presi dent of the Alaskan Boundary Tribunal not only has added to his already enviable reputation as a great judge but with his colleagues has rendered an inestimable service to the cause of international arbitration14

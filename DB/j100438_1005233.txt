J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005233,ON THE PURTURBATIONS OF METEORS APPROACHING NEAR THE EARTH BY BENJAMIN PIERCE A A HOLLIS PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN A LETTER TO S C WALKER ESQ,I241966,ARTICLE VIII ON THE PURTURBATIONS OF METEORS APPROACHING NEAR THE EARTH BY BENJAMIN PIERCE A A HOLLIS PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS AND NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN HARVARD UNIVERSITY IN A LETTER TO S C WALKER ESQ READ JANUARY 15 1841 MY DEAR SIR MANY SOURCES OF ALMOST UNCEASING OCCUPATION HAVE PREVENTED MY GIVING MR ERMANS PAPER ON METEORS THAT EARLY ATTENTION WHICH I INTENDED I SHALL NOW TURN MY ATTENTION TO THE POINT WHICH YOU SUGGESTED OF THE EARTHS ATTRACTION AL MOST THE WHOLE LABOUR HAS FORTUNATELY BEEN SAVED FOR ME BY LAPLACE IN THE MEC CEL VOL IV BOOK IX CHAP II  ON THE PERTURBATIONS OF A COMET WHEN IT APPROACHES VERY NEAR TO A PLANET HE HAS THERE PROVED 8038 BOWD ED THAT  WE MAY IN THE CALCULATION OF SUCH A COMET SUPPOSE THE PLANET TO HAVE A SPHERE OF ACTIVITY IN WHIICH THE RELATIVE MOTION OF THE COMET IS AFFECTED ONLY BY THE PLANETS ATTRACTION AND THAT BEYOND THIS POINT THE ABSOLUTE MOTION OF THE COMET ABOUT THE SUN IS PERFORMED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS IF THE SUN ALONE ACTED UPON IT THE RADIUS OF THIS SPHERE IS BY 8035 R  2 IN WHICH R  THE RADIUS VECTOR OF THE PLANET M  ITS MASS DIVIDED BY THE SUNS MASS SO THAT IN THE PRESENT CASE THIS RADIUS WHICH WE DENOTE BY R0 IS RO  00053 IN WHICH THE UNIT IS THE SAME AS ERMANS NOW THE RELATIVE ORBIT OF THE METEORIC RING IS DIRECTED NEARLY TO THE CENTRE  SCHUMACHERS ASTR NACHR NO 38584 OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORBITS OF THE EARTH AND I SHALL REGARD IT AS EXACTLY DIRECTED TOWARDS THIS CENTRE IN WHICH CASE THE ONLY EFFECT OF THE EARTHS ATTRACTION IS TO INCREASE THE RELATIVE VELOCITY WITHOUT CHANGING THE RELATIVE DIRECTION THE ONLY CHANGE WHICH IS THEREFORE REQUIRED IN ERMANS PAPER IS TO INCREASE THE RELATIVE VELOCITY V BY THIS INCREASE OF VELOCITY THE INCREASED VELOCITY IS DETERMINED BY THE FORMULA V 12 V 2  2  29 V0 V R R0 IN WHICH R  THE EARTHS RADIUS G  THE ATTRACTIVE FORCE OF THE EARTH AT THE UNIT OF DISTANCE VO THE INCREASED VELOCITY HENCE 2G G  0 13932 V02 V2  013932 R R0 AND THE FIVE VALUES OF V0 CORRESPONDING TO THE FIVE VALUES OF V CALCULATED BY ERMAN ARE 0 91118 1L41818 1 69177 193830 2 17363 NOTHING FARTHER SEEMS NEEDED UPON THIS POINT AND I THEREFORE LEAVE IT TO NOTICE AN OMISSION BY PROFESSOR ERMAN HE HAS NEGLECTED THE NEGATIVE SIGN OF THE RADICAL IN THE EQUATION V E COS U  V V2E2 SIN 2U AND THIS SIGN MAY BE USED AS LONG AS THE RESULTING VALUE OF V IS NOT NEGATIVE THUS FOR THE VALUE OF V 0 77382 WE SHOULD FIND V  0 29426 VELOCITY IN PERIHELION  2 235 PERIHELION DISTANCE  04186 T  060973 X  120 3 WHICH SHOWS THAT ERMANS CONCLUSIONS REGARDING THE RELATIVE VELOCITY AND THE INCLINATION OF THE ORBIT ARE UNSOUND IN REVIEWING SOME OF HIS NUMERICAL RESULTS I DIFFER A LITTLE FROM HIM BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS OF NO PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE ANOTHER MOST IMPORTANT POINT FOR CONSIDERATION IS THE DIFFERENCE OF DIRECTIONAND VELOCITY OF METEORS 85 OF THE DIFFERENT METEORS NOW THIS DIFFERENCE OF DIRECTION AMOUNTS TO MORE THAN 100 ON THE AVERAGE ACCORDING TO ERMAN FROM THE MEAN DIRECTION AND CANNOT FOR THE MAXIMUM BE LESS THAN 250 THIS DIFFERENCE OF DIRECTION MAY ARISE 1 FROM THE DIFFERENICE IN THEIR ELLIPTIC ORBITS ABOUT THE SUN 2 FROM THEIR MUTUAL ACTION 3 FROM THE EARTHS ATTRACTION 1 SUPPOSING WITH ERMAN THE BREADTH OF THE RING TO BE 20 THE DIFFERENCE ARISING FROM THE FIRST CAUSE CANNOT BE MORE THAN 1 FROM THE MEAN DIRECTION 2 THE DEVIATIONS ARISING FROM THEIR MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS MUST BE TRIFLING THEY CANNIOT FOR INSTANCE BE SUPPOSED GREATER THAN THEY WOULD BE IF ALL THE METEORS BUT THE DISTURBED ONE WHICH WE MAY BE CONSIDERING WERE COMBINED INTO ONE PLANET ABOUT WHICH THIS DISTURBED ONE MOVED AS A SATELLITE NOW IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE VARIATION IN THE MOONS ABSOLUTE DIRECTION FROM THE EARTHS IS ONLY ABOUT 20 WE SHALL HAVE NO HESITATION IN NEGLECTING THIS SECOND CAUSE OF DISTURBANCE THE DIFFERENCE IN DIRECTION ARISING FROM THE FIRST TWO CAUSES IS ABSOLUTE AND MAY BE SOMEWHAT MAGNIFIED WHEN CONVERTED INTO RELATIVE DIRECTION BUT NOT MUCH UNLESS THE RELATIVE VELOCITY V IS VERY SMALL THERE IS ALSO A DIFFERENCE OF ABSOLUTE VELOCITY WHICH WILL PRODUCE A DIFFERENCE OF RELATIVE DIRECTION OF ABOUT THE SAME ORDER OF MAGNITUDE WITH THAT ARISING FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF AB SOLUTE DIRECTION 3 THE OBSERVED DIFFERENCE OF DIRECTION MUST THEN BE CHIEFLY REFERRED TO THE PRINCIPAL DISTURBING CAUSE THE EARTH AND THE FOLLOWING METHOD OF CALCULATION IS SUFFICIENTLY ACCURATE FOR THE PRESENT CASE LET V THE RELATIVE VELOCITY OF THE METEORS AT THE MOMENT OF ENTERING THE SPHERE OF THE EARTHS INFLUENCE WHICH SPHERE WE MAY FOR THIS CAL CULATION SUPPOSE TO BE INFINITE  THE ANGULAR DEFLECTION OF THE METEORS RELATIVE MOTION THEN NO OTHER METEOR WILL BE SO MUCH DEFLECTED AS THE ONE WHICH JUST GRAZES THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND FOR THIS METEOR WE HAVE V2R COSEC C  1  V12  COSECCP 1 VIIIW86 OBSERVATIONS ON THE ORBITS AND VELOCITY OF METEORS WHENCE FOR A DEVIATION OF 15 V MUST BE LESS THAN ONETHIRD OF THE EARTHS VE LOCITY THAT IS FAR LESS THAN EITHER OF ERMANS SUPPOSED VALUES OF V AND FOR THE LEAST VALUE OF V WHICH ERMAN HAS GIVEN NAMELY V  083122 WE HAVE  20 38 WHICH APPEARS TO BE ENTIRELY CONTRARY TO A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE OBSERVATIONS NOW FOR V 033333  WE FIND WV  1410  75 SO THAT THE PLANE OF THE METEORS CANNOT DIFFER MUCH FROM THAT OF THE ECLIPTIC AND THEIR RELATIVE VELOCITY CANNOT EXCEED ONETHIRD OF THE EARTHS VELOCITY THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE ORBIT ARE OF LESS INTEREST AND I SHALL NOT STOP TO CALCULATE THEM A RING SO NEARLY IN THE PLANE OF THE EARTHS ORBIT MUST BE SUBJECT TO VERY GREAT PERTURBATIONS AND IF THERE IS ONE I THINK THAT NO OBSERVATIONS WHICH WE CAN MAKE WILL ENABLE US TO CALCULATE ITS MOTIONS WITH ANY DEGREE OF AC CURACY BELIEVE ME MY DEAR SIR MOST SINCERELY YOURS B

of those Coral lines that look like minute Trees and grow upon Oysters and Fucuss all round the Sea coast of this Kingdom S I R THE doubts that I find still remain on the minds of many curious and learned men of the animal nature of corallines on account of their beautiful ramifications and regular plantlike appearances determind me to persuade our ingenious friend Mr Ehret to accompany me to the seaside that he might there be an eyewitness of what I had advanced to you and many other 4 K 2 worthy Read June 13 1754628 worthy members of the Society and to make exact drawings of the several different objects as they ap peard to him thro the microscope Accordingly on Monday the third of this instant June we set out and arrivd at Lewes in Sussex that evening and the next morning at Brighthelmstone The weather being very calm and few fucuss or co rallines being thrown ashore on the beach I hird a fisherman the next day to take up some oysters from an old oysterground that had been long disusd lying about three or four leagues off to sea and where by his description the shells were coverd with great varieties of these minute treelike corallines with directions that as soon as he took them out of the sea he should immediately put them into a bucket of seawater but unfortunately he put the oysters into a fishermans basket by which means many varieties were dead notwithstanding we receivd them two hours after they were taken out of the sea and had them put immediately into seawater However by the oysters lying on one another some of the co rallines were kept so moist as to be perfectly alive and brisk In order to distinguish them more easily we pluckd them off the oysters and placed them in white earthen plates and pourd as much seawater over them as would just cover them After we had let them rest for a little while to recover themselves we could easily discover with a magnifying glass of an inch focus which were alive and which not Accordingly I cut off small pieces of several of the liveliest and placed them in watchglasses filld with seawater these after resting a little while I placed one after another on the stage of the microscope The629 The unusual sight so amazd our friend who had his doubts that he could scarce believe his own eyes for he had hitherto imagind with many others that these corallines were vegetables and only the recep tacles of animals as many other plants are and not the proper cases skins or coverings of their bodies The first coralline that offerd itself to our view was no 1 Plate XXII where it is represented in its natural appearance climbing upon the podded fucus a with irregular threadlike ramifications as at b one of which is exhibited magnified at A in which we may observe a broad dark line in the middle of the transparent stem and branches This is part of the tender body of the animal and seems as a sup port for its several heads and stomachs with the many hands or claws belonging to each For at the top of each of the branches we may observe a polype with twenty tentaculi or claws which do the office of hands its mouth in the centre of them and its sto mach underneath inclosd in a flne transparent cup The fine outlines represent the horny skin or out ward coat that serves this compound animal as a de fence in the same manner as the shells of testaceous or crustaceous seafish The skin or covering of the arms that support the cups is formd in small rings which gives the ani mals the more freedom to move about dextrously in seizing their prey At letter B is the microscopical representation of a still smaller coralline than the former the natural size of it is expressd at fig 2 This creeps up and twines round other corallines by small vermicular tubes and sends out its curious slender arms irregu larly630 larly These arms in the microscope look like rows of the smallest beads of a necklace To the top of each of these is fixd a cup for the reception of the polypes the brim of which is curiously indented These we saw alive and extending themselves about in various directions Fig no 3 represents part of another coralline of its natural size just as it appeard expanded in a plate of seawater It is calld in Rays Synopsis ed 3 corallina ra mosa cirris obsita and by Doody in Rays Synopsis ed 2 fruticulus elegans geniculatus cirris obsitus Letter C expresses a branch of this coralline magni fied where you may observe on each capillary side branch rows of small polypes each with eight ten taculi or claws rising out of little sockets The upper division or tube of these little branches as at b appears full of joints one to each polype but we could easily perceive that all the polypes were con nected together and communicate with the principal stem or body which is inclosd in the middle tube The under small tube of the capillary sidebranch at c which runs parallel with the upper one b and ad heres to it appeard clear hollow and jointed This coralline arises from a tust of small irregu larlymatted tubes like a sponge growing to an oyster shell as at g the smaller branches e are inserted in circles round the larger branch f at equal distances like the plant calld horsetail or equisetum As we were observing these corallines we perceivd on one of them a differentshapd polype which thrusted itself out of a small funnelshapd pipe

brim or border was surrounded by little spines These cells we observd to compose that spongy rough matter which incrusts almost all marine sub stances but chiefly fucuss Fig 4 represents the natural size of these cells on a fucus letter D ex presses the cells and polypes with twelve tentaculi to each as they appear magnified where the animals are seen raising and expanding themselves When they are disturbd they draw themselves within their sheath or pipe which closes on them and sink to gether into their cells The curious denticulated coralline at no 5 Plate XXIII has very much the appearance of a plant at first view even when it is magnified as at E This gave us a farther corroborating proof that these ex traordinary species of beings are animals For we observd that the smaller polypes that extend them selves out at the opening of every opposite denticle or little projecting tube are united at the bottom or lowerpart to the fleshy substance of the main body that passes thro the middle of each branch or stem and are so many different bodies united in one acting like so many sets of hands placed in form of a cir cle collecting food each for a mouth in the centre to convey nourishment to so many stomachs which are fixd in the swelling part or bottom of each den ticle This great supply of nourishment from all sides gives that great increase and variety of ramifi cations to this wonderful class of manybodied ani mals Besides these small polypes which compose the branches these corallines send forth from several 2 parts632 parts many vesicles of different shapes at certain sea sons of the year according to their different species These vesicles are protruded from the outward skin or horny covering of these branched polypes and from the inward or fleshy part arises a larger polype one of which occupies each of these vesicles Thus a coralline full of vesicles looks like a plant full of blossoms which after they have arrivd at their perfect state fall off with their capsules or ve sicles and become newdetachd animals to provide for themselves in the same manner as the falling seeds produce other plants Upon examining this coralline we found that the animals in the vesicles were dead but immediately afterwards we had an opportunity of discovering the vesiculary polypes alive in another coralline which are describd at fig 6 in their natural size and at letter F as they appeard magnified This species I have calld the seaoak coralline from its being most frequently found creeping on and adhering to the largest species of the quercus marinus or seaoak fucus The vesicles of the denticulated coralline letter E are describd as they appeard full of spines at the top and closd up as at letter G The vesicles of the same species are more fre quently found as describd at I where the spines are not unfolded From this appearance I have calld it the pomegranateflowering coralline because they nearly resemble the opening blossom of the balaustine or double flower of the pomegranate The branches of this coralline are often observd to end in vermicular tubuli as at H which are much of633 of the same form with those it begins with so that these animals can and do change their shapes for the several ends and purposes of their being and this in a most surprising manner I had farther an opportunity of examining some of those kind of corallines which I call celleferous from their having rows of cells disposd in plantlike rami fications The small black spots in each cell which I had conjecturd before to be the embrio of a future testaceous animal Vid Phil Trans Vol 48 Tab VI p 115 I found now to be the contracted bodies of dead polypes for we here saw some of these po lypes alive and extending themselves out of their cells as at K fig 7 and upon reviewing them when they were dead found they made the appearance of blackish spots in each cell as at L fig 7 So that we have reason to suppose that this species of polypes that form these corallines do change into testaceous bodies But of this I do not doubt that time and more observations will fully convince the curious I am S I R Your most affectionate friend and servant

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013655,A BASIS FOR A DURABLE PEACE BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND,I242660,DURABLE PEACE BIT WEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND 113 THEIR BIRTH TO SECURE EQUALITY OF RIGHTS AND THEREFORE MUST REST ON JUSTICE WITH THE SUCCESS OF THE ALLIES IT IS NOT ONLY FAIR TO PRESUME BUT MOST PROBABLE THAT THERE WILL BE NO MENACING AUTOCRATIC POWERS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE PRESENT WAR THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONS WILL BE PREPONDERANT AND THEY WILL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSON TO BE VIGILANT SO THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY THE LEADING POWERS OF THE WORLD BEING DEMOCRATIC WILL BE PRIVILEGED TO ENTER INTO A PARTNERSHIP THAT WILL GIVE SECURITY UNDER A LEAGUE OF DEMOCRACIES FOR THE PERPETUATION OF FREEDOM AND THE EQUAL RIGHTS OF ALL ITS CON STITUENTS GREAT AND SMALL UNDER THE DOMINATION OF AUTOCRATIC NATIONS THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE WORLD WAS IN AN ANAR CHISTIC STATE BUT UNDER THE LEAGUE OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS THE INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIP OF THE WORLD CAN AND DOUBTLESS WILL BE SECURED UPON THE BROAD AND LASTING FOUNDATION OF INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE A BASIS FOR A DURABLE PEACE BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND BY WILLIAM C BULLITT PHILADELPHIA I SHALL NOT ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEMS OF DURABLE PEACE IN GENERAL BUT SHALL TRY TO CONCENTRATE ATTENTION ON ONE OF THOSE ZONES OF HOSTILITY AND HATRED IN WHICH A CONFLAGRATION IS LIKELY TO ARISE AND TO WRECK A DURABLE PEACE AFTER IT HAS APPARENTLY BEEN MADE THERE ARE OF COURSE MANY SUCH ZONES IN THE WORLD THERE IS THE ZONE IN THE PACIFIC WHERE THE INTERESTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND JAPAN CONFLICT THERE IS THE ZONE IN THE BALKANS WHERE THE INTER ESTS OF RUSSIA AND AUSTRIA CONFLICT BUT I WISH TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO THE ZONE IN THE NORTH SEA WHERE THE HATRED OF GERMANY AND ENGLAND CONCENTRATES AND I SHALL TRY TO EXPLAIN THE SOURCE OF THAT HATRED AND A METHOD BY WHICH IT MAY BE ELIMINATED I DO NOT THINK THAT THE HOSTILITY OF GERMANY AND ENGLAND SPRINGS PRIMARILY FROM COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL RIVALRY I DO NOT THINK THAT ENGLANDS HATRED OF GERMANY SPRINGS PRIMARILY FROM HER WRATH AT THE VIOLATION OF BELGIUM AND THE ATROCITIES COMTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MITTED IN BELGIUM AND FRANCE I DO NOT THINK IT SPRINGS FROM ENVY OF THE GROWTH OF GERMANYS POWER IN THE PAST DECADE I DO NOT THINK THAT GERMANYS HATRED OF ENGLAND SPRINGS PRIMARILY FROM ENVY OF THE VAST BRITISH COLONIAL EMPIRE OR FROM THE BELIEF WHICH IS WIDESPREAD IN GERMANY UNBELIEVABLE AS IT MAY SEEM ON THIS SIDE OF THE WATER THAT ENGLAND STARTED AND ORGANIZED THE PRESENT WAR NONE OF THESE THINGS TO MY MIND IS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE HOSTILITY BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND IT LIES MUCH DEEPER IN THE THING WHICH IS USUALLY AT THE BOTTOM OF A GREAT HATRED FEAR FEAR ON THE PART OF GERMANY THAT THE BRITISH FLEET WILL STARVE HER TO DEATH FEAR ON THE PART OF ENGLAND THAT THE GERMAN SUBMARINES WILL STARVE HER TO DEATH HOW LEGITIMATE ARE THESE FEARS IS SHOWN VIVIDLY BY THE CONDI TION OF AFFAIRS IN BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES TODAYGERMANY ON THE VERGE OF STARVATION ENGLAND AFRAID THAT IN SIX MONTHS IF THE SUBMARINE CAMPAIGN GOES ON SHE WILL BE ON THE VERGE OF STARVATION BUT THESE FEARS ARE NOT SIMPLY THINGS OF TODAY THEY ARE INHERENT IN THE ECONOMIC LIFE AND GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION OF THOSE TWO GREAT INDUSTRIAL NATIONS COOPED TOGETHER IN THE SAME CORNER OF EUROPE GERMANY TODAY SCARCELY LESS THAN ENGLAND IS DEPENDENT UPON THE SEA FOR HER LIFE SHE HAS CEASED TO PRODUCE ENOUGH FOOD TO SUP PORT HER PEOPLE SHE MAY BE ABLE TO LIVE THROUGH THE PRESENT WAR WITH CLOSED FRONTIERS BUT HER AGRICULTURE HAS ALREADY BEEN RAISED TO A VERY HIGH STATE OF DEVELOPMENT IT IS NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF MUCH GREATER DEVELOPMENT AND WITH HER NORMAL INCREASE OF POPULATION IN TEN YEARS SHE WILL BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO LIVE WITH CLOSED FRONTIERS HER LIFE WILL BE IN THE GUN MUZZLES OF THE BRITISH FLEET MOREOVER SHE EARNS HER LIVELIHOOD LARGELY BY IMPORTING RAW MATERIALS TURNING THEM INTO FINISHED PRODUCTS AND EXPORTING THE FINISHED PRODUCTS AND FOR THIS ENTIRE PROCESS SHE MUST HAVE SECURITY ON THE SEA FUR THERMORE THE FEAR THAT SHE WILL BE CUT OFF BY THE BRITISH FLEET FROM HER SUPPLIES OF FOOD AND RAW PRODUCTS IS KEPT CONSTANTLY IN FRONT OF HER BY THE FACT THAT EVERY GERMAN SHIP THAT GOES TO THE OCEAN MUST PASS BY THE DOOR OF ENGLAND HER SHIPS CAN REACH THE OPEN OCEAN ONLY BY WAY OF THE CHANNEL OR THE NORTH SEA WHICH IS IN TRUTH BUT ANOTHER CHANNEL VARYING FROM THREE TO FOUR HUNDRED MILES IN WIDTH WHICH CAN BE CONTROLLED ALMOST AS EASILY BY THE FLEET BASED ON THE ORKNEYS AS THE CHANNEL IS CONTROLLED BY THE FLEET BASED ON PORTS MOUTH 114DURABLE PEACE BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND 115 I DONT THINK YOU CAN REALIZE UNLESS YOU HAVE GONE TO BED HUNGRY IN BERLIN DURING THE WAR HOW INTENSELY EVERY CLASS IN GER MANY FROM THE TOP OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE TO THE END OF THE MINORITY SOCIALIST PARTY IS DETERMINED THAT IN SOME WAY THERE MUST COME OUT OF THIS WAR SOMETHING WHICH WILL ELIMINATE THE DANGER OF BEING CUT OFF FROM OVERSEAS SUPPLIES THE GERMAN CONSERVATIVES HAVE THEIR SOLUTION THEY SAY ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS TO BUILD A BIGGER FLEET THAN ENGLAND OR SIMPLY DESTROY ENGLAND ALTOGETHER FORTUNATELY THAT IS MORE EASILY DREAMED THAN ACCOMPLISHED FOR UNTIL ENGLAND IS WILLING TO COM MIT SUICIDE SHE WILL RETAIN HER PRESENT NAVAL SUPREMACY SHE LIVES PARTLY ON HER BANKING TO BE SURE BUT VITALLY ON THE EARNINGS OF HER SHIPPING ON HER IMPORTS OF RAW PRODUCTS ON HER EXPORTS OF FINISHED PRODUCTS FURTHERMORE HER RELATIONSHIP WITH HER COLONIES IMPOSES ON HER THE OBLIGATION OF DEFENDING THEM AND THIS SHE AC COMPLISHES NOT BY MAINTAINING FLEETS IN THEIR WATERS BUT BY A CON CENTRATION OF FORCE IN THE NORTH SEA WHICH IS AT ONCE THE BASE OF DEFENSE AND ATTACK FOR THE WHOLE WORLD BUT THIS VERY SUPREMACY IN THE NORTH SEA WHICH ENGLAND MUST MAINTAIN MEANS A PERPETUAL LATENT CONTROL OF GERMAN COM MERCE THIS IS THE VICIOUS CIRCLE OF FEAR WHICH PRODUCES THE HATRED AND ENMITY BETWEEN ENGLAND AND GERMANY SO LONG AS THE FLEETS OF EACH THREATEN THE MERCHANTMEN OF THE OTHER SO LONG WILL THERE BE FEAR AND HATRED AND WAR BETWEEN THEM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES PERCEIVED THIS A LONG TIME AGO AND IN JANUARY 1915 IN ORDER TO ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE GERMANY AND ENGLAND HE SENT AN EMISSARY TO BOTH THOSE COUNTRIES TO PROPOSE WHAT I CONSIDER ONE OF THE WISEST PLANS THAT HAS EVER BEEN PUT FOR WARD BY THE GREAT MAN FOR I BELIEVE HE WHO IS OUR PRESIDENT IS A GREAT MAN THE EMISSARY OF THE PRESIDENT WAS ORDERED TO PROPOSE THAT GERMANY AND ENGLAND AND ALL THE OTHER NATIONS IN THE WORLD SHOULD AGREE THAT EVEN IN TIME OF WAR ALL MERCHANTMEN BOTH BELLIGERENT AND NEUTRAL SHOULD BE UNHINDERED IN THEIR PASSAGE EXCEPT WHEN CARRYING CONTRABAND AND THAT CONTRABAND SHOULD BE CONFINED STRICTLY TO MUNITIONS OF WAR THIS WOULD MEAN THAT EVEN IN TIME OF WAR THE MERCHANTMEN OF ENGLAND AND GERMANY WOULD COME UN HINDERED INTO PORT THAT THERE WOULD BE NO STARVATION OF CIVILIAN POPULATIONS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO THREAT OF SUCH STARVATIONTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND I BELIEVE THAT IT WOULD MEAN THAT THE FEAR WHICH IS AT THE BOT TOM OF THE HOSTILITY BETWEEN THOSE NATIONS WOULD BE ELIMINATED AND THAT IN TIME PERHAPS A DECADE OR TWO THEIR MUTUAL INTEREST IN THE PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT OF THE UNDEVELOPED PORTIONS OF THE EARTH WOULD LEAD TO THEIR COOPERATION AND ULTIMATELY TO THEIR FRIENDSHIP THE LEADERS OF THE GERMAN ARMY AND NAVY AND OF THE CON SERVATIVE PARTIES MET THE PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL WITH A MOST EM PHATIC NO THEY SAID WE WILL NOT GIVE UP OUR GREAT OFFENSIVE WEAPON THE SUBMARINE BY WHICH SOME DAY WE SHALL BE ABLE TO STARVE ENGLAND INTO SUBMISSION BUT ON THE OTHER HAND THE SOCIALISTS THE RADICALS AND VON JAGOW WHO WAS AT THAT TIME THE HEAD OF THE FOREIGN OFFICE ASSENTED TO THE PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL THEY SAID WE ARE WILLING TO AGREE TO GIVE UP OUR WEAPON OF OF FENSE IF WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT WE SHALL NEVER HAVE TO SUFFER AGAIN THE FOOD SHORTAGE WHICH IS SUCKING THE BLOOD OF OUR CHILDREN OUR WIVES AND OUR PARENTS AND ALTHOUGH THESE MEN ARE NOT IN CONTROL OF GERMANY TODAY THERE HAS BEEN EVERY INDICATION IN THE PAST FEW MONTHS THAT THEY WILL BE IN CONTROL OF GERMANY WHEN THE WAR CLOSES AND I BELIEVE THAT IN THE PEACE CONFERENCE GERMANY WILL STAND FIRMLY BEHIND THE PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL WHEN THE PRESIDENTS EMISSARY REACHED ENGLAND HE MET AL MOST EXACTLY THE SAME RECEPTION AS IN GERMANY THE CONSERVA TIVES SAID NO NEVER WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE MEANS BY WHICH WE KILLED NAPOLEON BY WHICH WE ARE KILLING GERMANY TODAY WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP THE COMMERCIAL BLOCKADE BUT THE LABOR LEADERS THE SOCIALISTS AND PARTICULARLY THE GROUP OF LIBERALS LED BY LORD LOREBURN ACCEPTED THE SUGGESTION AND SIR EDWARD GREY HIMSELF WAS INCLINED VERY STRONGLY IN THAT DIRECTION THEN THE SINKING OF THE LUSITANIA KILLED ALL HOPE OF IMMEDIATE RECONCILEMENT BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENGLAND AND THE SUBSEQUENT CAREER OF THE PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL I HAVE NOT TIME TO TRACE BUT THE FACT IS THAT WHEN THE PEACE CONFERENCE COMES THE PRESIDENTS PROPOSAL WILL AGAIN BE PUSHED BY THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNITED STATES AND I BELIEVE THAT ENGLAND CAN BE BROUGHT TO BACK THIS PROPOSAL ALTHOUGH THE SENTIMENT THERE TODAY I IMAGINE WOULD BE AGAINST IT I BELIEVE THAT SHE WILL ACCEPT IT ULTIMATELY FOR THE REASON THAT THE SUBMARINE IN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WILL BRING HOME TO HER WHAT IT MEANS TO FEAR STARVATION WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AFRAID THAT NOT ONLY YOURSELF BUT ALSO YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR PARENTS WILL NOT HAVE FOOD 116DURARTVJI PEACE BJSTWIN GERMANY AND ENGLAND 117 FURTHERMORE IT HAS COME TO BE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE BRITISH FOREIGN OFFICE THAT ENGLAND HAS BEEN ABLE TO CARRY OUT HER BLOCKADE OF GERMANY NOT MERELY BECAUSE OF HER FLEET BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ACQUIESCE IN THAT BLOCKADE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE ON THE WHOLE THAT HER CAUSE HAS BEEN JUST AND THAT HER TRIUMPH WILL BE TO THE INTEREST OF THE WHOLE WORLD FURTHERMORE ENGLAND KNOWS THAT THE SUBMARINE IS STILL A RELATIVELY UNDEVELOPED WEAPON AND THAT NO ONE CAN TELL HOW FATAL TO MERCHANT SHIPPING THESUPERSUBMARINE OF THE FUTURE MAY BECOME I THEREFORE BELIEVE THAT IF THE PRESIDENT HAS THE UNITED SUPPORT OF AMERICA ON THIS PROPOSITION IT WILL GO THROUGH PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF A RECENT ADDITION WHICH THE GOVERNMENT HAS MADE TO IT THE ADDITION IS THIS THAT ALTHOUGH THE RIGHT TO STOP MERCHANTMEN IN TIME OF WAR SHOULD BE TAKEN AWAY FROM ANY INDIVIDUAL STATE IT SHOULD BE RESERVED TO ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD ACTING COLLECTIVELY THROUGH THE LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE IN OTHER WORDS THE LEAGUE WOULD CARRY THE PISTOL WHICH WOULD BE DENIED TO ANY INDIVIDUAL STATE THIS ADDITION WILL REMOVE THE CHIEF OBJECTION OF THE BRITISH CONSERVATIVES WHICH IS THAT THE GERMAN ARMY IF THIS PLAN SHOULD BE ADOPTED WOULD DICTATE THE COURSE OF EVENTS IN EUROPE FOR THE LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE WOULD HOLD IN ITS HANDS A COUNTERPOISE TO BALANCE THE POWER OF THE GERMAN ARMY IT IS I BELIEVE THE DUTY OF ALL AMERICANS WHO ARE INTERESTED IN A DURABLE PEACE TO BACK THE PRESIDENT IN THIS PROPOSAL BECAUSE I SEE NO OTHER WAY WHEREBY THE HATRED BETWEEN GERMANY AND ENG LAND CAN BE ABOLISHED AND UNLESS THAT HATRED CAN BE DONE AWAY WITH UNLESS THE ROOTS OF IT CAN BE CUT WHILE THE LEAGUE TO ENFORCE PEACE MAY PROLONG PEACE IT WILL NEVER ESTABLISH A PEACE WHICH CAN BE CONSIDERED DURABLE FURTHERMORE IF THIS PROPOSAL SHOULD BE ADOPTED IF THE STARVA TION OF CIVILIAN POPULATIONS SHOULD BE TAKEN OUT OF WAR A GREAT STEP FORWARD WILL HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF DECENT INTER NATIONAL MORES AND AFTER ALL WE ARE ENTERING THIS WAR FOR ONE PURPOSE AND ONE ONLYTHAT BETTER INTERNATIONAL MORES MAY BE ESTABLISHED ON THE EARTH

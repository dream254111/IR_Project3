ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS,I206909,408 XII A LETTER FROM RICHARD BROCKLESBY M D AND F R S TO THE PRESIDENT CON CERNING THE INDIAN POISON SENT OVER FROM M DE LA CONDAMINE MEMBER OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES AT PARIS HONOURED SIR T H E SUBJECTS OF NATURAL HISTORY ARE OFTEN STRANGE AND UNCOMMON BUT THE AUTHORS WHO HAVE TREATED ON THEM HAVE NOT FAILED ON THEIR PARTS TO SUPPORT AND RAISE THE WON DER AND ONCE CONCEIVED ASTONISHMENT BY ASCRIBING PROPERTIES WHICH NEVER EXISTED IN NATURE THUS IN  THE HUMOUR OF FINDING A MARVELLOUS IN ALL THINGS TRUTHS HAVE BEEN GREATLY OBSCURED AND ERRORS PROPAGATED WITHOUT NUMBER READ FEB 5 17467 IT IS TO THIS CAUSE ORIGINALLY IF I MISTAKE NOT WE ARE TO ASCRIBE THE PRODIGIOUS MULTIPLICITY OF POI SONS AND THAT EQUALLY NUMEROUS TRIBE OF ANTIDOTES TREATED OF BY THE ANCIENTS IN THEIR MATERIA MEDICA AND I SHOULD BE VERY GLAD TO HAVE FOUND MODERN AUTHORS ALWAYS JUST TO TRUTH IN THE QUALITIES BY THEM ASCRIBD TO PARTICULAR DRUGS UPON HEARING LATELY PART OF MR JUAN ANTONIO DE LOAS LETTER TO YOU SIR I WAS SUSPICIOUS MR DE LA CONDAMINE HAD TAKEN SOME FACTS THERE UPON THE AUTHORITY OF OTHERS OR ELSE HAD BEEN HIMSELF A LIT TLE TOO MUCH ADDICTED TO THAT GENERAL BYAS OF MAN KIND THE LOVE OF PRODIGY AND WONDER IN409 IN ORDER TO BE BETTER SATISFYD I DISSOLVED IN A CER TAIN QUANTITY OF FAIR WATER AS MUCH OF THE INDIAN POISON AS COULD BE SUSPENDED AND LET IT STAND TO CLEAR 24 HOURS AND HAVING MADE A SUPERFICIAL IN CISION WITH A LANCER INTO THE NOSE OF A YOUNG CAT A FEW DROPS WERE SPRINKLED ON THE WOUND THE CREATURE AT FIRST DISCOVERD NO MARKS OF INJURY RE CEIVD YET IN HALF AN HOUR SHE SEEMD BY MEWING MORE THAN BEFORE TO BE SENSIBLE OF SOME PAIN THUS SHE REMAIND ABOUT 20 MINUTES WHEN AT LENGTH SHE SHIVERD WAS SLEEPY SOON BECAME CONVULSD AND IN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR HER LIMBS WERE FLACCID AND HER BELLY SWELLD THESE SYMPTOMS CONTINUD TILL SHE IN A SHORT TIME EXPIRD SOME TIME PASSD EER I SAT DOWN TO INQUIRE WHAT VISIBLE EFFECTS HAD BEEN PRODUCED ON THE BODY I THEN SEPARATED THE HEAD FROM ITS TRUNK AND CARE FULLY EXAMIND THE BRAIN AND PARTICULARLY THE ORIGIN OF THE NERVES BUT WHEN I HAD CONSIDERD IT THOROUGHLY I COULD NOT DISCOVER ANY PRETERNATURAL APPEARANCE IN ANY OF THESE PARTS HAVING SPENT NEAR HALF AN HOUR IN THIS INQUIRY I OPEND THE THORAX AND WITH SOME SURPRIZE FOUND THE PULSATION OF THE HEART AS REGULAR AS IF THE ANIMAL WERE IN PERFECT HEALTH THIS APPEARANCE CONTINUD ABOVE TWO HOURS AFTER THE CATS HEAD WAS OFF BUT AFTERWARDS LAN GUISHD AND WAS MUCH WEAKER I THEN OPEND ONE VENTRICLE OF THE HEART IN WHICH THE BLOOD WAS SOMEWHAT COAGULATED THIS MAY BE THOUGHT TO BE PARTLY OWING TO THE MEDICINE FOR SOON AFTER IT HAD PRODUCD CONVULSIONS IN THE CREA TURE I HAD A MIND TO SEE WHAT BLOODING WOULD DO G G G 2 AND410 AND WITH THAT VIEW CUT OFF THE TAIL BUT CONTRARY TO MY EXPECTATION THE ARTERIES THAT SUPPLY IT WITH BLOOD BLED VERY LITTLE AND UPON CUTTING OFF THE HEAD THE CAROTIDS AND BOTH VERTEBRALS DID NOT POUR OUT ABOVE HALF A COMMON SPOONFUL BUT AS IT MIGHT BE QUESTIOND BY SOME FROM THE CONTINUANCE OF THE HEARTS PULSATION WHETHER THE CAT MIGHT NOT POSSIBLY IF LET ALONE HAVE RECOVERD I POURD A FEW DROPS OF THE SAME SOLUTION AS BEFORE INTO A SUPERFICIAL WOUND OF A YOUNG DOG WEIGHING 12 POUNDS THE CREATURE IN LESS THAN AN HOUR SHIVERD BECAME SLEEPY WAS VERY COLD AND SO STUPID THAT HE SUFFERD HIMSELF TO BE OFTEN BURNT BY THE HOT ASHES BENEATH THE GRATE WHERE HE LAY FOR WARMTH IN THIS COMATOUS WAY HE CONTINUD NEAR FOUR HOURS AND THEN SHOOK OFF HIS STUPOR AND WAS MUCH BETTER I LEFT HIM ALL NIGHT AND FOUND HIM NEXT MORNING QUITE WELL AND AS HUNGRY AS EVER UPON THIS I MADE AN INCISION AT THAT TIME INTO ONE OF THE CRURAL VEINS AND POURD A FEW DROPS OF THE SOLUTION INTO IT IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES THE DOG GAVE SIGNS OF GREAT PAIN SOON SHIVERD GREW COLD WAS CONVULSD AND IN LESS THAN 20 MINUTES DIED UPON OPENING HIM NOTHING UNCOMMON WAS FOUND NOR WAS THE BLOOD IN THIS CREATURES HEART SO THICK AS IN THE FORMER THE CRURAL VEIN DID NOT BLEED FROM A LARGE ORIFICE OFTER THE POISON WAS INFUSED THOUGH IT WAS LIKELY TO DO IT BEFORE BUT AS SOME AUTHORS HAVE SAID THAT BIRDS IN PAR TICULAR ARE INSTANTLY DEPRIVED OF LIFE IF THE LEAST PARTICLE411 PARTICLE OF CERTAIN POISONS ARE INFUSED INTO THE BLOOD I HAD A MIND TO TRY ONE EXPERIMENT AND TO THIS END INFUSED A FEW DROPS OF OUR SOLUTION INTO A CUTICULAR WOUND OF A SMALL BIRD THIS OCCASIOND HANGING OF THE FEATHERS AND A STUPOR IN LESS THAN 10 MINUTES AND KILLD HIM IN SOMEWHAT MORE THAN FIFTEEN I GAVE ABOUT TWO DRACHMS OF SUGAR TO ANOTHER BIRD OF THE SAME KIND AND SHORTLY AFTERWARDS POURD A LITTLE OF THE SOLUTION INTO ITS MOUTH BUT TWO DROPS HAD SCARCE TOUCHD HIS TONGUE BEFORE THE CREATURE WAS CONVULSD AND I COULD WITH DIFFICULTY LAY HIM DOWN BEFORE ALL MOTION WAS TAKEN AWAY I GAVE THESE TWO BIRDS TO TWO CATS AND WHETHER FROM EATING THEM OR NOT I DONT PRETEND TO SAY THE CATS MADE SO UNCOMMON A NOISE THE WHOLE NIGHT THAT THEY DISTURBD THE FAMILYS REST FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS WE FIND THAT THE SUPPOSED SPECIFIC IS OF NO MANNER OF USE EVEN WHEN THE POISON IS ONLY TAKEN AT THE MOUTH AND FROM THEM IT MAY APPEAR PROBABLE THAT OUR POISON IS NEARLY UPON THE SAME FOOTING WITH WHITE ARSENIC IN THE CURE OF THE TOOTH ACH THUS SIR HAVING SATISFIED MYSELF I THOUGHT I COULD DO NO LESS THAN GIVE YOU AN ACCOUNT OF THE RESULT OF MY TRIALS IF THEY CONTAIND ANY THING THAT COULD AFFORD YOU ANY PLEASURE TEN TIMES THE TROUBLE I HAVE TAKEN WOULD BE AMPLY REPAID BUT AS THE SUBJECT ITSELF IS FAR FROM THE MOST ENTERTAINING AND I AM CONSCIOUS THAT OTHERS MAY HAVE CARRIED IT ON TO MUCH BETTER PURPOSE SO I HAVE NOTHING TO PLEAD IN412 IN EXCUSE OF THIS TROUBLE FARTHER THAN THAT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE WITH GREAT RESPECT S I R YOUR MOST OBLIGED AND HUMBLE SERVANT

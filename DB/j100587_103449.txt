Pipes as it is retarded by Friction and intermixed Air some of which were made before the Royal Society on Thursday the 5th of May 1726 With a Description of a new Machine whereby Pipes may be cleard of Air as the Water runs along without StandPipes or the help of any Hand By the Rev J T Desaguliers L L D F R S H A V I N G found by several Experiments in small that thro a long Pipe Water woud not be dischargd in the same Quantity by a great deal as it woud be thro a shorter of the same Bore the Orifice being at the same Depth under the Sur face of the Water in a Reservoir I made an Experi ment upon a Pipe above 1000 Yards in length and of 1 34 Inch Bore at his Grace the Duke of Chandoss House at Cannons and found that the Quantity of Water given was much less I think  less than it ought to have been according to Mons Mariottes Rules and that something more than the Friction on Account of the Length of the Pipe had retarded the Water which I found since to be Air confind in the eminent Parts of the Pipe A full Account of this Experiment I publishd in my Notes upon Ma riottes Mouvement des Eaux in the English Transla tion some Years ago Considering this Matter again lately I made the following Experiment Fig 1 A is a Vessel contain ing a Cubic Foot in the Inside and always kept full L by78 by means of the Pipe B running from a larger Vessel C D is a short Pipe of 34 of an Inch Bore two Foot in length opening into the Bottom of the Cistern A and whose Orifice D is always 10 Inches below the Bottom of A O G E E E H F is another Pipe of the same Bore whose Orifice F is likewise 10 Inches below the Bot tom of A This Pipe is 113 Yards long lying a long the Ground five Foot below A except the de pending Part O G and the ascending Part H F When F is stopped and A being kept full the Water runs out at D the Quantity of Water given is 19 Times more than when D is stoppd and the Water runs out at F The Air confind in several Parts of the long Pipe is the chief Reason of this Difference In order to get rid of the Air which lodging in the Pipe contracts its Bore and thereby lessens the Quantity of Water which is to be deliverd at the lslue I made several Experiments to find whereabouts the Air does lodge the more easily to let it out one of which was as follows I took a Glass Pipe as A B Fig 2 of about one Inch in Diameter 12 Foot in length from P to P only the Parts A P and P B at the other End were of Lead Then pouring in Water at A till it came up to B stopping the End G the Air lodgd in the eminent Parts of the Pipe at the Places markd C C D D and E E But when the Water was sufferd to go out at G the Air came forward towards G and took up the Spaces c c d d and e e contracting the Bore of the Pipe as before but stood forwarder in the Pipe so that it generally happend that the Space of Air began upon the upper part of the Eminence of the Pipe N B The Glass Pipe may be made of several Pieces joind to each other and to the Leaden Pipes I and79 and Funnels by Brass Ferrils and Elbows turning in all manner of Angles These are not represented here If the Velocity of the Water is very great the Air will go even beyond the Eminence of the Pipe To let out the Air from the Conduct Pipes which obstructs the Running of the Water I recommend the Experiments which I made and the Apparatus which I applied to a Wooden Conduct Pipe of nine Inches Bore which runs a Mile and an half from the Water Engine at YorkBuildings to a Reservoir near Caven dishsquare the Surface of the Water in the Cistern at the Waterhouse being sometimes 15 and sometimes 20 Foot above the Issue at the Reservoir Upon a Part of the Pipe such as A B Fig 3 I fixd a Leaden Pipe D F of 2 Inches in the Bore by means of 3 Ferrels or short CommunicationPipes the first at D just beyond the Beginning of the Space C C that usd to be filld with Air in the running of the Water the Second in the Middle of the Leaden Pipe and the Third at the End of it the Length of the Pipe itself being from 12 to 24 Feet according to the Steepness of the Descent the shortest Pipe being suf ficient where the Descent is very quickFrom the Mid dle of the Leaden Pipe abovementiond calld a Ri der from its being laid along on the Main or Conduct Pipe there goes another Leaden Pipe as E H of the same Diameter rising all the Way very gently from E to the Cock H and so on to I because if there was the least Descent Water woud lodge in it Now when the Water runs from A to B the first Ferril D will catch the Air as it runs so as to let it out at I if the Cock H be open sometimes without going to G or to C But if the Cock had not been opend till the Water had passd thro the Part A B of the Pipe the  woud lodge in the Space C C and be L 2 dischargd80 dischargd upon the opening of the Cock After the Cock has been shut when no more Air comes and Water succeeds after some time Air will extricate it self out of the Water and come up to C C or if it comes from the Parts of the Pipe towards B it will rise contrary to the Current of the Water quite up to C and so go out at the Pipe E H when the Cock is opend again As after the first Discharge of the Air it cannot be known when more Air is got into the Pipe unless by opening the Cock which wou d require one Man to attend each Cock constantly and occasion a waste of Water at every turn of the Cock unless when Air happens to be in the Pipe it was proposd to contrive a Valve that shoud open to let out the Air and shut again when the Water came and an inverted Brass Clack or Valve shutting upwards and falling down by its own Weight with Cork fixd to the Underside of it to help it to rise when the Water came was men tiond as fit for the Purpose by some of the Persons that I was talking with about it But we rejected that Proposal because when such a Valve has been shut some time if Air shoud extricate itself from the Wa ter it woud be dense Air whose Force being equal to that of a Pillar of Water 30 60 80 or more Feet in height it woud keep the Valve shut as well as the Water did before tho the Air at first coud not shut the said Valve At last after several Thoughts we contrivd a Ma chine which exactly answers the Purpose and is very simple therefore it will be of general Use The Description of it is as follows In the fourth Figure G is a Section of the Main or Conduct Pipe with Water up to G and Air above it A B being an horizontal Line touching the Top of the said Pipe E H I is the Leaden Pipe describd above and81 andmarkd with the same Letters as in the third Figure reaching from the Pipe in the Street to the Side of an House or to the Side of one of the Posts that are set up to keep off Coaches from the Footway The Ma chine is the Box K made of CastIron fixd to the Lead en Pipe at I with a thin Door of PlateIron moving on Hinges and made to lock at D This Box stands in the Street out of the way of Passengers with its Bottom fixd to a Plank in the Pavement so as not to be damagd by a small Shock or any chance Blow The several Parts of the Machine are the following Figure 5 N N is an Iron Plate about an Inch thick with 4 Holes at 1 2 3 4 of about an Inch Diameter quite thro the Plate to let thro 4 Screws such as a O O is a Face or flat Ring raisd out of the whole Stuff and prominent about 14 of an Inch ground or turnd to a true Flat 5 Is an Hole of about 1  Inch Diameter to receive the Nose of a Cock which is put thro it stopping with a Shoulder or Flaunch screwd within the Circle O O by 4 other Screws markd with large Points round the Hole 5 Fig 6 N N is the same Plate seen Edgewise M is the AirCock screwd to the said Plate thro the Flaunch of its Pipe at m n having its Key 6 10 fas tend to a Rod of about 12 an Inch Diameter of the Fi gure 6 7 8 10 having a Shank one Foot long 8 9 joind to a Buoy or hollow Copper Ball L which Ball when the said Shank is in an horizontal Situation keeps the Cock shut but falling by its own Weight when not sustaind by the Water opens the Cock by means of the Rod 8 9 as may be seen in Figure 7 where the Plate N N is screwd to the Box and the prickd Line M L shews the Surface of the Water coming into the Box thro the great Cock and Leaden Pipe H I so as to make the Ball L float with its Shank in82 in the horizontal Situation 8 9 but when more Air comes in to drive the Water down the Pipe I the Buoy will fall to l and its Shank coming down to 10 11 will open the Air Cock M and let out the Air be its Density what it will till it be all dischargd and the Water is again got up to M L and has raisd up the Buoy to L N N is the Forepart of the Box with its Hole to which the Plate of Fig 5 is screwd It is easily conceivd that the Cock H must always be left open that the End of the Pipe I is screwd to an Hole in the Bottom of the Box by means of Screws at r r that there are oild Leathers at the Heads of all the Screws and likewise upon the Plate N N to make the Face O O of Fig 5 apply it self close to the Forepart of the Box K Fig 8 which has an Hole at O O to take in the Buoy and Cock of Figure 6 the Screws at 1 2 3 4 which have their Heads within the Box and their Nuts such as b Fig 5 screwd on when the Plate N N is applyd and that the whole Box thus fitted is made Airtight D in Figure 4 and D D in Fig 7 represent an Iron Door to cover the Mouth of the AirCock from ex ternal Injury and is punchd full of Holes to let out the Air freely This Machine which from its Make we calld a Jack in a Box will be useful wherever Water is to be conveyd a great way in Pipes and since I was not the sole Contriver of it I ought in justice to those that joind their Thoughts with me to acquaint the Publick that the Box is the joint Invention of Mr Richard Jones Mr James King Mr Thomas New comen Mr Joseph Hornblower his Operator and my self F I N I S

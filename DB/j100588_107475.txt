particularly on the relation between the elasticity temperature and latent heat of different vapours and on themnometric admeasurement and capacity By Andrew Ure M D Communicated by W HWollaston M D F R S Read April 80 18i8 Glasgow July X817 i On the elasticforce of vapours with new formula to determine it at any temperature and a review of those given by DALTON and BIOT THE phenomena attending the conversion of liquids into elastic fluids were first accurately investigated by Dr BLACK He observed in the rising of vapour and melting of ice a beautiful system of relations connecting and modifying the grandest operations of nature while they were destined to afford new principles for the advancement of the arts If it be the prerogative and characteristic of genius to discover in the most familiar or as some would say vulgar phenomena that mystic chain of causation which had eluded all other eyes unquestionably the doctrines of latent heat entitle their author to rank in the first class of philosophers Dr BLACK directed his attention principally to the establish ment of the general laws which he placed on an immoveable basis leaving to his pupils the subordinate task of investi gating their individual applications Hience the elastic forces of the vapours arising from different bodies at different temperatures seem to have occupied him very little if at allDr URES new experinentalessea4ec s  c This subject was examined however with great ability by two of his most distinguished friendss Professor RoBrsoc and Mr VWATT The investgations of the former were published in the Encyclopaedia Britannlica article steam while we have still to regret our ignorance of those executed by the latter philosopher with probably a more complete apparatus and more extensive views We are indebted to him indeed for some curious observation on the latent heat of steam at different temperatures which make us lament more the want of those on the elastic forces themselves Mr DALTON whose peculiar speculatis on caloric nd meteorology led him to study the formation and variable elasticity of vapour with great attention has since then favoured the world with many excellent dissertations and is now reckoned the first authority on the subject Mr DALTONS experiments on the steam of water were carried no higher than its ordinary boiling point but from the observed pro gression of its elastic force le investigated a formula ad calculated from it a table for the higher temperatures In the second number of the Journal Polytechnique M BETANCOURT an eminent Spanish engineer long resident at Paris published a set of experiments on the same subject the results of which differ from those of Mr DALTON in many particulars but most remarkably in the higher part of the scale Having had my mind often called to this impportant inquiry in the course of my public lectures on the applications of Science to the Arts an apparatus of a very simple nature occurred t me about two years ago by which I hoped to be  Manchester Memoirs vol v p563 MDCCCXVIII yDr URES new experimental researches able to determine with great precision the elastic forces of vapours at any temperature from zero of FAHRENHEIT to a much higher degree of heat than even BETANCOURT seems to have reached The experiments were made soon after that time but circumstances have till now prevented me from arranging them for publication With BETANCOURTS apparatus I am not acquainted having seen only the brief table of results inserted in our systematical works on chemistry Professor ROBIsoNs con sisted of a strong boiler or digester containing the water and furnished with three small apertures the first receiving the bulb of a thermometer the second covered with a safety valve and the third having a barometer tube attached At first I used a similar construction but finding it hazardous and somewhat unmanageable in the high heats and difficult to render air tight in the lower temperatures I abandoned it after some unsatisfactory trials At the low degrees of heat the vacant part of the barometer tube introduces errors since it has not the temperature of the boiler and the bulb of the barometer used in high heats occasions a similar fallacy in the determination of the true elasticities Still however it was ingeniously conceived and the results furnish good approximations creditable to the celebrated experimenter They agree nearly with those of BETAN COURT being obtained probably in a similar way The method adopted by Mr DALTON is recommended by an elegant simplicity It is merely a common barometer into which a little of the vapourgiving liquid is introduced so as to oisten and float above the mercury The vapour which is  See Encyclopaedia Britannica vol xvii p 739 zd Edition 84oon some of the leading doctrines of caloric c generated depresses more or less the barometric column Hence by subjecting the liquid to successive degrees of tem perature the corresponding depressions of the barometer or elasticities of the vapour are obtained The only difficulty in this mode of operating is to bring a considerable length of vertical tube to an uniform temperature Mr DALTON well aware of this source of error obviated it in a great measure by taking a series of different tubes decreasing in their lengths with the increasing expansions of the vapour and concomitant descent of the mercurial column In several experiments conducted on this plan I found it scarcely possible to obtain results rigidly corresponding with each other when the column of vapour exposed in the barometer tube to the influence of surrounding heat exceeded two inches in length M BIOT in his system of physics recently published while he adopts Mr DALTONS results as the basis of his reasoning treats fully of this difficulty and suggests an ingenious means of avoiding it  We have had occasion several times to  remark says he that the temperature of a mass of liquid  which cools in the air is not entirely the same at the bottom as it is at the top of the vessel because the colder particles  subside into the lower strata by the excess of their weight Thus the temperature of the column of hot water which  surrounds the tube in the preceding experiment cannot  be rigorously uniform throughout its whole height We e may endeavour to render it equal by agitating and mingling  the different strata of which it is composed but this would 34t34 Dr URES newv experimental researches  be attended with no little difficulty It would be better to have several thermometers suspended at different heights in the body of the water and to take the arithmetical mean oftheir indications Or otherwise which would probably  be more exact we might employ a thermometer having a cylindrical bulb equal in length to the column of vapour  It would then be necessary that the column of water should rise sufficiently above this vapour to allow the thermo meter bulb to be equally immersed or we must make on its indications the small correction mentioned p 59 in  order to reduce the temperature of the cylinder of mercury to the temperature of the reservoir The employment of such a thermometer may appear at first sight sufficiently  difficult since it seems that the length of the cylindrical reservoir must be very considerable if the elastic force of the vapour be great He then proceeds to show how this difficulty may be ob viated as indeed it had previously been by Mr DALTON by taking barometer tubes successively shortened as the force of the steam is augmented by heat He proposes to use four between the freezing and boiling points of water each being two decimeters or nearly 8 inches long and the thermometer bulb having also that length The plan which I imagined as it completely obviates the source of errors arising from the large and variable space occupied by the vapour supersedes the necessity of employing M BOTrs singular remedy It likewise avoids other complications introduced by the heat ing and consequent elongation of the mercurial column itself  Traite de Physique Tome 1 p 268on some f h leading doctrines of caloric c attending all the other methods and scarcely capable of being exactly appreciated at high temperatures with the apparatus of Professor BOBISON The space over which the vapour extends in my instrument need never be greater than half an inch of a barometer tube against the side of which part the oblong bulb of a delicate thermometer rests so as to indicate the true temperature And though the liquid and incumbent vapour are thus always restricted to the summit of the barometer tube we can not withstanding measure its progressive range of elasticity from zero of FAHRENHEIT to one hundred or even two hundred degrees above the boiling point of water from an elasticity of 007 of an inch to that capable of sustaiing 14 feet or even 36 of mercury Fig t P1 XIX represents the construction employed for temperatures under and a little above the boil ing point Fig X and 3 are used for higher temperatures the last is the more convenient of the two Each was sus pended from a lofty window ceiling and placed in a truly vertical position by means of a plumb line One simple principle pervades the whole train of experi ments which is that the progressive increase of elastic force developed by heat from the liquid incumbent on the mercury at I Pl I is measured by the length of column which must be added over L the primitive level below in order to restore the quicksilver to its primitive level above at I These two stations or points of departure are nicely defined by a ring of fine platina wire twisted firmly around the tube At the commencement of the experiment after the liquid well freed from air has been let up the quicksilver is made a tangent to the edge of the upper ring by cautiously pouring a343Dr URES new experimental researches mercury in a slender stream into the open leg of the syphon D The level ring below is then carefully adjusted From the mode of conducting my experiments there remained always a quantity of liquid in contact with the vapour a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research Suppose the temperature of the water or the oil in A to be 8g F as denoted by a delicate thermometer or by the liquefaction of ice communicate heat to the cylinder A by means of two argand flames playing gently on its shoulder at each side When the thermometer indicates 42 modify the flames or remove them so as to maintain an uniform temperature for a few minutes A film or line of light will now be perceived between the mercury and the ring at  as is seen under the vernier of a mountain barometer when it is raised a few feet off the ground Were tle tube at I and L of equal area or were the relation of the areas experimentally determined then the rise of the quicksilver above L would be one half or a known submultiple of the total depression equivalent to the additional elasticity of the vapour at 40 above that at 32 Since the depressions however for o3 or 4o degrees in this part of the scale are exceedingly small one half of the quantity can scarcely be ascertained with suitable precision even after taking the above precautions And besides the other sources of error or at least embarrass ment from the inequalities of the tube and from the lengthen ing space occupied by the vapour as the temperature ascends render this method of reduction very ineligible By the other plan we avoid all these evils For whatever additional elasticity we communicate to the vapour above  it will be faithfully represented and measured by the 344on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c mercurial column vhich we must add over L in order to overcome it and restore the quicksilver under I to its zero or initial level when the platina ring becomes once more a tan gent to the mercury At E a piece of cork is fixed between the parallel legs of the syphon to sustain it and to serve as a point by which the whole is steadily suspended For temperatures above the boiling point the part of the syphon under E is evidently superfluous merely containing in its two legs a useless weight of equipoised mercury Accordingly for high heats the apparatus fig 9 or 3 is employed and the same method of procedure is adopted The aperture at 0 fig 3 admits the bulb of the thermo meter which rests as usual on P The recurved part of the tube is filled with mercury and then a little liquid is passed through it to the sealed end Heat is now applied by an argand flame to the bottom of C which is filled with oil or water and the temperature is kept steadily at 212 for some minutes Then a few drops of quicksilver may require to be added to D till L and I be in the same horizontal plane The farther conduct of the experiment differs in no respect from what has been already described The liquid in C is progressively heated and at each stage mercury is progres sively added over L to restore the initial level or volume at I by equipoising the progressive elasticity The column above L being measured represents the succession ofelastic forces When this column is wished to extend very high the vertical tube requires to be placed for support in the groove of a long wooden prism  Rings of other metals will not suit for their expansions being much greater than that of glass they become loose with the elevation of temperature 845Dr UREs new expertmental researches The height of the cutnn in some of my experiments being nearly i2 feet it became necessayry to employ a ladder to reach its top I found it to be convenient in this case after observing that the column of vapour had attained its primitive magnitude to note down the temperature with the altitude of IhecoluIn  then immediately to pourin a measured quantity of mercury nearly equal to three vertical inches and to wait till the slow progress of the heating again brought the vapour in equilibrio with this new pressure which at first had pushed the mercury within the platina ring at I When the lower surface of the mercury was again a tangent to this ring the temperature and altitude were both instantly observed This mode of conducting the process will account for the experimental temperatures being very often odd and fractional numbers I present them to the public as they were recorded on the instant in that particular repetition of the experiment which I consider most entitled to confidence To trim and fashion the results into an orderly looking series would have been an easy task  but in my opinion this is a species of de ception very injurious to the cause of science and a deviation from the rigid truth of observation which ought never to be made for any hypothesis We shall afterwards have ample opportunities of exposing the fallacy of such premature geo metrical refinements The thermometers were constructed by CREIGHTON with his well known nicety and the divisions were read off with a lens so that O of a degree could be distinguished After bestowing the utmost pains in repeating the experiments during a period of nearly two months I found that the only way of removing the little discrepancies which crept in 34 6on son of the leang doctines of caloric c 347 between contiguous measures was to adopt the astronomical plan of multiplying observations and

physical science have been happily brought within the pale of geometry this celebrated philosopher has deduced from Mr DALTONs experiments on the force of steam a general formula for determining its elasticity at any temperature In investigating this formula he represents the decrease of the logarithms of the elastic forces by a series of terms of the form an  bn2  cn3 a b c being constant coefficients Thus Log F  Log 3o 4 an b6n2  cn3 It is unnecessary to employ powers of n higher than the cube because their coefficients would be insensible as the calculation will show To determine the

is a very interesting problem in chemical philosophy It may possibly unfold the law which connects temperature and elastic energy and it may furnish likewise some useful applications Mr DALTON has

apothecaries boils generally at 11i but when washed with water or redistilled it boils at io4 or o15 It may by rectification however be made to boil at a still lower temperature Concerning the boiling point of oil of turpentine curious may we say ridiculous discrepancies exist in our systems of chemistry Dr MURRAY for example in the table of the scale of temperature at the end of the first volume of his valuable system last edition places the boiling point of oil of turpentine at 560 Mr DALTON vol 1 p p 9 of his new system of chemical philosophy says  several authors have it that oil of turpentine boils at 560 I do not know how the mistake originated but it boils below si like the rest of the essential oils I made with much care several experiments on this point previous to ascertaining the force of its vapour and found its boiling point to be about 316 When recently distilled however it will boil at 805 Did it boil below or even at 212 as Mr DALTON asserts then long before the included portion in the above experiments had reached the 3o4th degree it would have acquired such an elasticity as to support a high column of mercury instead of being barely in equilibio with the atmospheric pressure Plunge a phial half filled with fresh oil of turpentine into a metal cup containing any fixed oil Heat the cup gradually It will be found that at the temperature of 316 the oil remains in steady ebullition as indicated by a thermometer suspended in the centre of the phial Prior to this even at a36oon some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 120 some small bubbles will be evolved principally owing to the moisture dispersed in the pores of the oil from the water originally mixed with the crude turpentine in its dis tillation If the heat be very rapidly thrown in while the upper surface of the oil of turpentine has the area only of a one or two ounce phial it is possible to heat it to 360 or g87o in apparent contradiction to the theory of latent heat for when a liquid boils in an open vessel according to Dr BLACK its temperature should remain stationary The true cause of this phenomenon is developed towards the conclusion of this memoir The specific caloric of the vapour of the volatile oil is so small compared to that of water that the heat may readily be quicker introduced than the boiling pro cess can abstract it Concerning the boiling point of this oil I have since inquired of a manufacturer and he states its boiling point at 32o Essential oil of rosemary when kept for some time boils at o70 recent oil at 212 To assign the cause of this difference is foreign to our present object The vapour of ether follows nearly the same rate of expan sion as water if we start from their respective boiling points This was observed also in Mr DALTONS experiments and from this single analogy chiefly he laid down the general law that the variation in the force of vapour from all liquids  is the same for the same variation of temperature reckon  ing from vapour of any given force My experiments on oil of turpentine and petroleum show the fallacy of this generalization if we reckon the common thermometric scale a tolerably correct index of temperature but if with Mr DALTON we consider our thermometric scale 361Dr UREs new experimental researches as very erroneous then ether itself is an exception to its own law to use this paradoxical though just expression In consequence of his peculiar thermometric ideas Mr DALTON has abrogated the above law which he had himself framed though it is curious to observe in some respectable treatises on chemistry both hypotheses detailed without indicating their mutual incompatibility M BIOT likewise far from imagining that the law had been repealed for 8 or 9 years proposes to judge by its provisions of the total elastic force of every vapour at 1oo centigrade to serve as the basis of the deter mination of their respective specific gravities at that tem perature My experiments show that from o15 to 1675 FAHREN HEIT ether trebles the tension of its vapour as water also does from 1ig to 2727 both containing nearly but by no means exactly equal intervals of the FAHRENHEIT graduation According to Mr DALTONS corrected scale of temperature we have 2120 FAH  212 DALTON 105 FAH  119 DALTON 273 F  256 D 1675 F  176 D real interval  444 by DALTON By DALTON 57  the real interval of temperature Thus we see that while the interval for trebling the tension of ethereal vapour is 57 that for aqueous vapour is only 4404 quantities that are to each other nearly as ioo 8o Hence according to this eminent chemist ether must take for  On peut calculer par la loi de M DALTON quelle doit etre pour chacun deux la force elastique totale de sa vapeur a la temperature de ioo degres Trait6 de Physique Tome i p 393 g62o n some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 363 trebling the force of its vapour a fifth part more heat than water does I hope presently to be able to adduce satisfactory experi mental evidence that our thermometric indications are not at all so unequable as Mr DALTON conceives Meanwhile in examining closely the table of the vapour of ether a beautiful analogy with that of water presented itself The series of ratios representing the progression of the latter being lowered a single step will accurately fit the former At 30 inches of elasticity 123 was our initial num ber for aqueous vapour for ethereal it becomes 122 in creasing or diminishing by unity each time in the second decimal figure according as we descend or ascend by

MDCCCXVIII BDr URts new experimental researches upper range the correspondence is as gopd as the delicacy of the experiments at such temperatures could permit us to expect The experiments have been presented without modi fication I must o wn that when first the above perfect coin cidence appeared it gave me no small pleasure as it led me to suppose that I had discovered the hidden chain of nature In treating of the vapour of alcohol Mr DALTON consi ders it as irregular in the progress of its elastic force by heat owing to its not being a homogeneous liquid He suspects  that the elastic force in this case is a mixture of aqueous and alcoholic vapour I cannot see the cogency of this argument for if the separate bodies have a regular pro gression the mixture ought not surely to be anomalous I believe however that if the experiments were made with due accuracy alcohol would be found as methodical in the elastic march of its vapour as other bodies The following table will afford satisfactory proofs of the justness of these views For absolute alcohol the progression is probably as simple as that of the preceding vapours But for alcohol sp gr o8i which though highly rectified contains not a little water we should expect it to result from a composition or modification of ratios After some search on this principle I accordingly found it Starting from the boiling point 174 pr

importance in chemical philosophy what are the relative portions of temperature denoted by the graduations of our thermometric scale  Mr DALTON regards the progressive elasticities of aqueous and ethereal vapour as affording countenance if not support to his thermometric innovations He affirms that if our instrument for measur ing heat were accommodated to his doctrine the quan tity of expansionof its mercury is as the square of the temperature from its freezing point then  the force of  steam in contact with water increases accurately in geome trical progression to equal increments of temperature  provided these increments are measured by a thermometer  of water or mercury the scales of which are divided by  the above mentioned law Were this position true it would certainly bring a powerful analogy in aid of his theoretical views We are now furnished with dta to verify or refute it The following tables show the correspondence between that principle and experi menlt In

intervals of real temperature contained in the second In the third are the corresponding points of the common scale as given by Mr DALTON To these points the elastic forces as determined by experiment are placed oppo site in the fourth column Table second for vapour of ether is similarly arranged the first three columns being Mr DALTONS the fourth the faithful transcript of observation  The force of the vapour of sulphuric ether says Mr DALTON in contact with liquid ether is a geometrical pro  gression having a less ratio than that of water  Ether as manufactured in the large way appears to be a very  homogeneous liquid I have purchased it in London Edin burgh Glasgow and Manchester at different times of precisely the same quality in respect to its vapour This shows that no exception can be made to my experiments on account of a supposed difference in the quality of the ether From the mode of conducting my experiments there remained always a quantity of liquid ether in contact with the vapour a circumstance essential to accuracy in this research The results were verified by frequent repetitions and discover in my opinion the consistency of truth  New System vol i pp 0o zx 367Dr URES

amount to 158 inches  experiment gives 13 17  and I am confident that the latter cannot be in error above an inch or two Again at 262 equivalent to 2812 FAHRENHEIT his theory gives the force of the same vapour at 120 inches by observation it is only 1035 Now at this part of the scale my result is con firmed by the concurrence of those obtained by BETANCOURT and RoBISON I consider this demonstration complete If we compare these very elasticities of Mr DALTON with the table formerly given by the same philosopher we shall find Manchester Memoirs vol 5 368on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 369 discordances which no ingenuity can harmonize At that time 225 of FAHR  229 of the new scale gave a force of vapour equal to 383 it is now 395 S526 F  242 D then coincided with an elasticity of 586 inches above it is 69 And finally 2812 F  62 D were opposite to go inches they have become here 20o And yet no new ex periments on the vapour of water have been adduced to justify such immense alterations It may be said indeed that these changes arise merely from the substitution of one hypothesis for another but the deviations from experiment are even more remarkable since as 282 new scale correspond to 31105 FAHR the difference amounts to 43 inches being more than one fourth of the total elastic force generated at that high temperature When we turn our attention to ether we find the discre pancies if possible less easy to reconcile At the temperature of 212 for example where the old and new scales meet for the last time the force of its vapour by the geometrical progression exceeds that found from experiment by the enormous quantity of 67 inches and a half amounting to two fifths of the whole elastic force evolved May we venture then to conclude from these multiplied comparisons that the progressions of elasticity in vapours taught by Mr DALTON are geometrical fictions intended to quadrate with his notions concerning temperature but not consonant with the laws or phenomena of nature  Within a moderate compass indeed it is not difficult to suit the ratio of elastic force and the thermometric graduation to each other but the prosecution of the enquiry into ranges more remote detects the fallacy of such hypothetical adapta7Dr URES new experimental researches tions My experiments on the vapours of water alcohol and ether seem to show that the ratio of tension decreases in a certain progression as the temperature augments Were the ratios 1e2 192 12 c which are seen to apply so well to aqueous vapour for a considerable range above 212 to be adopted as representing the progressive march of nature it would lead to the absurd conclusion that at 40o above the boiling point or 45s F the farther influx of caloric would occasion a diminution of elasticity in the steam The truth however is that at the g3sth degree indications of a diver gence begin to appear between the two lines of experiment and calculation which had run for so long a space nearly parallel The curve representing the expansive force of steam I consider to be logarithmic in which the ratios as ordinates continually diminish without ever vanishing or coming to an equality The axis is an asymptote to the curve as in the atmospherical logarithmic CHAPTER II On thermometric admeasurement and the doctrine of capacity Before inquiring into the relative quantities of heat con tained in different vapours at the same tension it will be proper to determine the primary and fundamental proposition concerning the measure of temperature It is singular that not one experimental fact has been advanced capable of settling this question amid the contending opinions of chemi cal philosophers Mr DALTON has in particular exerted all the resources of his genius and science to destroy our confi dence in the thermometric scale our sole guide in the vast 7on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 371 and intricate province of caloric While I hope to be able to fix this now indeterminate point by a new train of investiga tions and consequently to prove the entire fallacy of his doctrine of temperature the keystone of his system of heat I do not mean to affirm the absolute uniformity of expansion in bodies by equal increments of that power I think it indeed highly probable that every species of matter both solid and liquid follows an increasing rate in its enlargement by caloric Each portion that enters into a body must weaken the antagonist force cohesion and must therefore render more efficacious the operation of the next portion that is introduced Let iooo represent the cohesive attraction at the commencement then after receiving one increment of caloric it will become iooo   999 Since the next unit of that divellent agent will have to combat only this diminished cohesive force it will produce an effect greater than the first in the proportion of loo to 999 and so on in continued progression That the increasing ratio is however greatly less than Mr DALTON maintains may I think be clearly demonstrated According to his table of equal increments of temperature vol i p 14 New System we have the following intervals corresponding to the five successive intervals of 90g on our scale From 32 to 129 to 21s to 302 to 392 to 480 Intervals by FAHR of 9o 90 900 9go go9 True intervals by DALTON 10o4 776 639 5507 50o5 The relative inequality of these intervals is deduced from Mr DALTONS law that  all pure homogeneous liquids as water and mercury expand from the point of their congela MDCCCXVIII 3 C372 Dr UREs new experimental researches  ton or greatest density a quantity always as the square of the temperature from that point He regards the law as resulting from the constitution of liquids and therefore not applicable to solid bodies This is indeed implied in its enunciation In p 4 after assigning reasons he states that for all practical purposes we may adopt the notion of the equable expansion of solids Now I am prepared to prove either that the expansion of solids partakes of the above inequability of liquids which nobody imagines and for which no reason even hypothetical can be assigned or which is the only alternative that homo geneous solids and mercury proceed almost exactly pari passu in their rates of expansion by heat The experiments which justify this assertion were made by me about five years ago and were then exhibited to many of my chemical friends as also in my public lectures but a wish to render the series more complete has induced me to withhold them from the public eye till requisite leisure could be afforded for this purpose They were performed with a pyrometer of peculiar construction in an oblong trough filled with melting ice a strong bar of Swedish iron was placed from which projected at right angles four inflexible iron arms attachable by powerful screws to any part of the bar The arms nearest the extremities of the bar carried each a fine micrometer microscope made by that admirable artist Mr TROUGHTON The other two arms were incurvated down wards at their extremities which supported a metallic or other rod This was fixed by two pinching screws at one end but lay loose on a friction roller at the other The loose end bore an elevated index The curvature of these two arms wason some of the leading doctrines of caloric c such as to allow their extremities with the attached rod to be plunged beneath the surface of oil or water about an inch contained in a copper trough This was placed parallel to the large trough and a few inches distant from it The copper vessel was slowly and equably heated by a series of argand lamps placed beneath One micrometer watched a point projecting from the arm that held the fixed extremity of the rod The oil was carefully agitated during the application of the heat and the bulbs of three thermome ters mutually comparable were immersed into it at regular distances The micrometers were screened from the influence of the heat They rendered the 200O of an inch discernible and even a smaller quantity by an experienced eye A rod of pure Swedish iron or of such pure copper as jewellers use for alloying gold being adjusted to the appara tus the point on the micrometer scale that appeared a tangent to the small luminous aperture in the thin index plate of steel was noted down when the liquid in the trough was at 32 The value and truth of the micrometrical indications had been previously ascertained by viewing through the microscopes a given surface or aperture moved laterally so as to make its image successively coincide with the different points of the interior notched scale Heat being now applied the progressive march of the index across the field of view of the micrometer microscope was closely observed and its position written down at intervals of 10o or go of the FAHR thermometer But as the pyro metrical details will appear in a separate memoir on the ex pansions of bodies I shall state here merely what concerns the present subject 873Dr URES new experimental researches If we denominate the absolute elongation of the heated metallic rod from 3to to l io then its elongation from i 2 to 19O from 212o to 302  from 830 to 392 from 3S9 to 48e was in each successive interval of 9o F as nearly as pos sible to also The slight irregularities incident to all delicate experimental investigations being often in opposite directions in different repetitions of the same experiment or those which manifested themselves in the ascending or elongating range were neutralized so to speak by others of an inverse nature which appeared in the cooling retrocession Here the movements of the liquid mercury and of the solid rod by heat proceeded paripassu through a very great extent of tem perature Let us now recollect that these 5 increments which on our thermometer are equivalent to 5 x 9o  450 and which altogether produce five times the elongation that the first interval occasions constitute on Mr DALTONS scale only 350 If we call the first interval given by this philoso pher 1oo then the four succeeding intervals contain a range of temperature on his scheme of only two and a half times the first and therefore only two and a half times additional elongation should have been produced instead of four times as found by experiment  Since for all practical purposes uniform increments of bulk or expansions of solids by heat correspond to uniform increments of this power  then each of our old successive intervals of 9go may for all practical purposes be held to correspond to equal increments of temperature Mr DALTONS intervals from 3g to 489 FAHR are as before given 1oO4 776 6309 557 5o05  350 1 Now if we call the first quantity loo it will produce on a O74on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c metallic rod a corresponding effect in expansion  0o The next interval of Mr DALTON9S scale equal always to go9 FAHR  can produce only 4 of the effect of the first or as 75 to 100 The third fourth and fifth intervals will give the fractional expansions in reference to the first of 4 6 and about 4  or merely a half No such diminution of effect was observed in the experi ments from 39 to 482 F the rod elongated as much as from 3S 1220 or double the quantity compatible with the DALTONIAN hypothesis Thus therefore we have a rigid and I think unanswerable demonstration of the general correctness of the common scale of temperature and of the extreme inaccuracy and inapplicability of Mr DALTONS geometrical substitute Should the preceding statement leave any doubt or obscurity concerning the legitimacy of the inference now drawn I trust it will be entirely removed when the details of the experiments are published with drawings of the apparatus in my treatise on pyrometry Yet though the mercury in the thermometer tube move paripassu with a metallic rod deemed uniform in its expan sion it does not prove perfectly equal uniformity of expansion to belong to the mercury It will seem no doubt a para doxical assertion that of two bodies marching together hand in hand one of them may have an equable pace while that of the other is regularly but very slowly accelerated Yet I think the position just It proceeds from a circumstance in the thermometer sufficiently obvious but which seems to have escaped our systematic writers I do not rest the pro position on any imperfection of workmanship or supposed irregularity in the expansions of the glass 375376 Dr URES new experimental researches Let us take a thermometer the calibre of whose stem is perfectly uniform and whose scale is exactly divided Let it have a range from zero to the 656th degree at which mercury boilsby the accurate experiments of CREGIHTrN At 3o let the mercury stand at the bottom of the ivory scale where of course the graduations commence The bare part of the instrument is consequently the plunging limit in most chemical researches on the temperature of liquids Immerse the bulb in common oil or oil of vitriol heated to sis  part of the whole included mercury will now ascend above that part of the stem plunged in the liquid The part actually exposed to the heat and by whose expansion the column on the scale is supported is only f of the initial mass Augment the heat of the oil till the instrument indicate 9s we know that there remains now under the immediate influence of the heat f nearly of the original weight of mercury and finally at 572 only about  rest in the immersed part of the stem and bulb r or  parts may be considered as no longer subjected to the power of caloric If the thermometer stem were recurved near the bulb the mercury in the stem placed hori zontally would be cold and this proposition would be almost exactly true Now since the calibre and divisions are uniform the capacity of the tube fromt the point marked l2i to that marked 39s and again from this to that opposite to 57s is in each equal to its capacity from 32 to 212 Hence these three equal capacities are filled by the expansions of the three unequal quantities of mercury 62 61 60 At the  A minute fraction less but we need not complicate the statement with iton some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 877 highest station the column of quicksilver equal on the stem to 3 x 18o0 is sustained by the expansion of 6o parts at the middle point 2 x 180 is supported by that of 61 and at 12 there are 62 parts of mercury to sustain 18o in the tube Or to put it in another form these three successive spaces on the scale are equal the first portion of mercury is pro truded into it by the expansion of 69 parts in tle bulb the second portion by the expansion of 61 and the third by that of 6o Thereforeif these three thernlometric intervals of 180 each of which holds an equal measure of mercury contain also equal increments of temperature as denoted by the equal increments of a metallic rod then these three equal effects are produced from the unequal quantities of mercury 62 61 60 This liquid then must have an increasing rate of expan sion the inverse of these numbers for every 180 of the scale or   4i That is to say 60 parts at 572 do the same work by the same power of caloric as 61 at 392O and 6s at 212 I belleve this to be the real nature of mercurial expansion and the true condition of the thermometer which is an equable measurer of heat because the mercury possesses the above increasing rate of expansion Were the mercury on the contrary absolutely uniform in its augmentations of volume by equal increments of heat then for an instrument whose bulb alone in practice can be immersed the three above ranges should have the corresponding parts of the scale shortened in the successive proportions of 62 to 63 6i to 6s and 60 to 63 quantities taken together nearly equal to 9 or  3 x Ei x 180   Dr URES new experimental researches Whatever reception these speculations may experience they must not be confounded with the experiments on the expansions of metallic rods and the corollaries which have a distinct and independent existence  II On the doctrines of capacity as connected with the pre ceding investigation Dr CRAWFORD and DE Luc tried to verify the justness of the thermometric indications by mixing together water at 212 and 32 when the former found 122 and the latter 119 to be the resulting temperature DE Lucs number is 3 below the mean Dr CRAWFORDS is exact This inge nious philosopher afterwards sought to confirm the evidence thus given to the accuracy of the scale by other experiments which were however of rather an equivocal import Both of the above results have been condemned and rejected by Mr DALTON he states the true mean temperature to be not la1 nor even 19 but 1 o0 For this deviation the reasons which he assigns appear independently of all arguments derived from other quarters to be in themselves inconclusive He says the temperature of the above mixture ought to be found above the mean 122  Water of these two tempe  ratures 382 and 12 being mixed loses about  of its bulk This condensation of its volume must expel a quantity of heat and raise the temperature above the mean p 7 Again p 50 that water increases in its capacity for heat with the increase of temperature Icon  sider demonstrable from the following arguments ist A  That condensation of volume in a liquid is no proof of the expulsion of heat is shown in my Essay on Sulphuric Acid 378on some of the leading doctrines of caloric   C measure of water at any one temperattre mixed with a measure at any other temperature the mixture is less tan  two measures Now a condeation of volume is a cerain  mark of diminution of capacity and increase oftenperaturei as in the mixture of sulphuric acid and water or the efect  of mechanical pressure as with elastic fluids Second  when the same body suddenly changes its capacity by a change of form it is always from a less to a greater as the temperature ascends for instance ice water and vapour  Third Dr CRAWFORD acknowledges from his own ex  perience that dilute sulphuric acid and most other liquids  he tried he found to increase in their capacity for heat with  the increase of temperature Admitting the force of these arguments it follows that when water of 32 and 912 are  mixed and give a temperature denoted by 19 of the common thermometer we must conclude that the true mean temperature is somewhere below that degree I have already assigned the reason why I place the mean at io Now the only reason I can elsewhere find is derived from his general law6 that all homogeneous liquids expand as the square of the temperature from the point of greatest density or congelation In p 7 he ventures to assert nothing more than  that it is not improbable that the true mean tempe rature between 32 and 212 may be as low as 110o FAH  RENHEITo Satisfied from my pyrometrical experiments that his general hypothesis of the expansion of liquids being as the  For the entire fallacy of this reasoning see my Essay just quoted expansion of volume should by Mr D increase capacity and diminish temperature The very reverse is shown in that paper MDCCCXVIIT 3 D 3879Dr URES new experimental researches square of their temperature is totally inapplicable to mercury the inference relative to the thermometric mean between 3o and e2 cannot be allowed But let us examine on their own merits the preceding arguments against Dr CRAWFORD and DE Lucs verification of the mean temperature between that of freezing and boiling water The reasoning derives its sole force from the assumption that the capacity of water for heat increases as its tempera ture is raised There is adduced however no fact in the least decisive on this main point What analogy is there between the entire change of form and constitution suffered by an incon densible liquid on becoming an elastic vapour and the pro gressive heating of the liquid itself Or although dilute sulphuric acid and other liquids should increase in their specific caloric on being heated which however has not been satisfactorily demonstrated are we to assert that water must do so too  It is a matter of surprize to me that a philosopher of Mr DALTONS judgement and acuteness should have pressed such inconclusive analogies into his service He knew well that water is endowed with some curious peculia rities when compared with other liquids or anomalies as we idly stile them  for they constitute no anomaly in nature but wisely fit water for performing the important functions assigned to it in the economy of our globe In a series of experiments carefully conducted on the relative capacities for heat of water sulphuric acid oil of turpentine and spermaceti oil published in my Essay on hydrochloric acid and the chlorides it seems to be directly demonstrated that the specific heat of water does not increase but actually diminishes and that very conspicuously as its 380ot some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 38 temperature rises It is there proved that from sio to 150o FAHR the specific heat of oil is to that of water as 697 to 1ooo and from 15oo to 90g as 513 to o0oo The same pro portional difference of relation is exhibited by the other two liquids Now were the phenomenon occasioned by the oil of vitriol common oil and oil of turpentine increasing in their capacities for heat in a still more rapid ratio than water we should undoubtedly expect from the innate differences between the specific heats of these three substances to find that they would move independently on each other or at different rates But their uniform advance together while water alone varies in this respect shows distinctly that in the water resides the cause of the variation This reasoning may be illustrated in many ways but by nothing more clearly than the exploded astronomical system of the diurnal and annual movements of the sun and fixed stars in support of which very extravagant hypotheses had to be contrived The single fact of the motion of the earth once admitted reduced the PTOLEMAIC chaos to order If in like manner we should suppose an increasing ratio in the specific heat of water then we must also suppose a much more rapid increase in the ratios of the above three substances although their individual specific heats are greatly inferior to that of water Ought not that body which has of all others the most decided relation to heat or highest specific heat to have also its ratio most decidedly or rapidly augmented  In adopting the increasing specific heat of water we must farther assume that however different the initial specific heats of the above three liquids may be yet while they possess all the same rate of increase water alone has a different one an inadmissible supposition All882 Dr URES new experimental researches these difficulties and contradictions are removed at once by the experimental fact that water is endowed with a de creasing ratio in its capacity for caloric as its temperature is augmented Since finishing the above researches on specific heat I have been led to examine attentively the systematic accounts of this subject in our chemical treatises and I find that BER THOLLET with a sagacity peculiar to himself had anticipated from the chemical constitution of bodies such an experimental result as I have recently obtained though the statements then prevalent all militated against his views c If caloric s obey the usual laws of attraction when it is in small  quantity relative to the body to which it is united it will c enter into more intimate combination and hence the elas ticity or expansive energy of it on which temperature depends may be overcome and a larger quantity be required to produce a given temperature Hence the quantity of c caloric contained in bodies in the first stage of temperature may be greater than it will be higher in the scale In the Essay above referred to I have shown that this cir cumstance in water renders it peculiarly qualified for serving as the magazinee and equalizer of te temperature of the globe Since at our ordinary atmospherical heats it pos sesses the greatest capacity for caloric small variations in its temprerature give it a great modifying power over the circumambient air Although the doctrine of final causes be no safe guide to the discovery of unknown truths yet wven it concurs with experiment we may deen it an agreeable confirmation This is finely illustrated by Count RUMFORDS speculations on the maximum density of water being placedon some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 383 several degres above its point of congelation a fact which does not hold with regard to any other homogeneous liquid If the specific heat of water then diminish as its tempera ture advances from the freezing to the boiling point an interval of lo0 near 320 will contain more caloric than ten degi ees near l e and still more than the same intervals near 212e On this principle we can readily account for the results obtained by Mr DALTON in mixing with water at different temperatures a knowxn prowortion of ice  though it is remark able that this able chemist did not see in them any thing inconsistent with his own opposite views upon specific heat sc 17605 expresses the number of degrees of temperature  such as are found between 20oo and 2 1i of the old or corn  mon scale entering into ice of 32 to convert it into water of 832 150 of the same scale suffice he says for the same effect between 12t and 1o0 and between 45and 50 1i8 are  adequate to the conversion of the same ice into water  These three resulting numbers 128 150 1765 are nearly as 5 6 7 Hence it follows that as much heat is necessary to raise water g5 in the lower part of the old scale as is  required to raise it 7 in the higher and 6 in the middle Mr DALTON instead of adopting the obvious conclusion that the capacity of water for heat is greater at lower than it is at higher temiperatures and that therefore a smaller number of degrees of the former should melt as much ice as a greater number of the latter ascribes the deviation denoted by these numbers or their differences to the gross errors of our thermometric graduation which he considers  New System vol i p 5 3384 Dr URES new experimental researches so excessive as not only to equal but greatly to overbalance the real increase in the specific heat of water which left to its own operation would have produced opposite experimental results That our thermometric scale has no such prodigious deviation from truth or uniformity of indication I conceive to be fully established and therefore the only legitimate inference from these very experiments of Mr DALTON is the decreasing capacity of water with the increase of its tem perature It deserves to be remarked that my experiments on the relative times of cooling a globe of glass successively filled with water oil of vitriol common oil c give exactly the same results as Mr DALTON derived from mixtures of 2 ounces of ice and 60 of water This concurrence is the more satis factory since when the Essay on hydrochloric acid was written I had no recollection of Mr DALTONS experiments I found that from 1o to 1500 the specific heat of oil bears to that of water the ratio of 597 to 1ooo and from 150 to 9g that of 513 to 1ooo Now at his highest and middle temperatures of 2oo0 and 120o which come nearest to mine of 180 and 12o we have by him the ratio of 17605 to 15o But 597  513  176 150 exactly which is a very strik ing coincidence and affords the happiest confirmation of the accuracy f both sets of experiments as well as of the just ness of the principles on which they were conducted and on which particularly my reductions were founded We now see the reason why when equal weights of water at soa and 212 are mixed the temperature may be below the mean as was found by DE Luc The capacity at the middle tempeon some of the leading doctrines of caloric c rature is greater than the mean capacity of the two extremes that is of the ingredients mixed ice cold and boiling water and therefore the thermometric tension will be lessened and its mercury will descend on the scale This diminution of temperature will cause a corresponding diminution of bulk which affords a complete answer to Mr DALTONS first and only plausible argument formerly quoted against Dr CRAW FORDS deductions and the opinions of DE Luc With regard however to these experiments of mixing hot and cold water to find a mean temperature there are sufficient difficulties to render the result uncertain to 2 or 3 degrees Hence nothing of moment can safely be inferred from them Concerning sulphuric acid in its various states of dilution I beg to refer the reader to my Essay on the subject where he will find several peculiarities relative to its volume at dif ferent acid strengths that entirely change its relations to caloric I have not seen these formerly adverted to by any chemist They were evidently unknown to Mr DALTON CHAPTER III On the latent heat of dfierent vapours What relation is there between the caloric existing in the vapours of different substances and the temperatures at which they respectively acquire the same elastic force  On this subject I am not acquainted with any preceding inquiries though a question of such interest has probably not escaped examination  Taking Mr DALTONS three numbers as correct then 7652  152025 But 15o in the middle are equal to the former mean of the two Hence the propo sition in the text is demonstrated 385Dr URES new experimental researches In this research I employed a very simple apparatus and with proper management I believe it capable of giving the absolute quantities of latent heat in different vapours as exactly as more refined and complicated mechanisms At any rate it will affbrd comparative results with great pre cision It consisted of a glass retort of very small dimensions with a short neck inserted into a globular receiver of very thin glass and about three inches in diameter The globe was surrounded with a certain quantity of water at a known tem perature contained in a glass basin 20o grains of the liquid whose vapour was to be examined were introduced itlto the retort and rapidly distilled into the globe by the heat of an argand lamp The temperature of the air was 45 that of the water in the basin from 42 to 4 and the rise of tem perature occasioned by the condensation of the vapour never exceeded that of the atmosphere by 4 degrees By these means as the communication of heat is very slow between bodies which differ little in temperature I found that the air could exercise no perceptible influence on the water in the basin during the experiment which was always completed in 5 or 6 minutes A thermometer of great deli cacy was continually moved through the water and its indications were read off by the aid of a lens to small frac tions of a degree In all the early experiments of Dr BLACK on the latent heat of common steam the neglect of the above precautions introduced material errors into the estimate Hence that dis tinguished philosopher found the latent heat of steam to be no more than 800 or 81o Mr WATT afterwards deter 86on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c mined it more nearly from 90o0 to 9500 and LAVOISIER and LA PLACE have made it ooo It is evident that whenever the water into which the latent heat is evolved by condensation of the vapour becomes much hotter than the surrounding air it will be impossible to ascertain how much of the caloric is dissipated and conse quently the true quantity contained in the vapour must re main uncertain The sources of error in operating with the calorimeter of LAVoISIER and LA PLACE were first pointed out by Mr WEDGWOOD and have been since commented on bv Dr THOMSON and other good systematists It is said to be difficult to obtain precisely uniform quantities of liquified ice in the repetition of the same experiments with that celebrated apparatus From the smallness of the retort in my mode of proceed ing the shortness of the neck and its thorough insertion into the globe we prevent condensation by the air in transitu while the surface of the globe and the mass of water being great relative to the quantity of vapour employed the heat is entirely transferred to the refrigeratory where it is allowed to remnain without apparent diminution for a few minutes In numerous repetitions of the same experiment the accord ances were excellent The following table contains the mean results The water in the basin weighed in each case 32340 gr The globe was held steadily in the centre of the water by a slender ring fixed round its neck The distilla tion was rapidly performed so that all the condensation took place in the globe MDCCCXVIII 387388 Dr URE new experimental

phenomena exhibited in the mechanical conden sation and rarefaction of gases and vapours as well as from their general constitution it may be inferred that an intimate and necessary connection subsists between their latent heat elastic force and specific weight or density Hence when their tension is the same it appears reasonable to suppose that the product of their densities into their quan tities of latent heat will also be the same Repulsive energy 389Dr URES new experimental researches will be proportional to the quantity of heat the repulsive power condensed or contained in a given space Thus if the space left for its interposition or lodgment be in one vapour a half or a third of the amount of the space in another we ought to find equal tension produced in the former case by a half or a third of the latent heat required for the latter As the principle I have reason to suppose is somewhat new let us illustrate it by an application to the three vapours in the above list which are most homogeneous or at any rate best understood those of alcohol ether and water Aqueous vapour of an elastic force balancing the atmos pheric pressure has a specific gravity compared to air by the accurate experiments of GAY LUSSAC of 10 to 16 For facility of comparison let us call the steam of water unity or 1oo then the specific gravity of the vapour of pure ether is 400 while the specific gravity of the vapour of absolute alcohol is 6o But the vapour of ether whose boiling point is not 100oo but 11  like the above ether contains some alcohol hence we must accordingly diminish a little the specific gravity of its vapour It will then become instead of 400oo  55 Alcohol of 0825 sp gr contains much water specific gravity of its vapour   230 That of water as before unity    100

latent heat existing in ethereal vapour will occupy a proportional space be equally condensed or possess the same tension with 2 in alcoholic and  in aqueous 239 loo vapour A small modification will no doubt be introduced by the difference of the thermometric tensions or sensible heats under the same elastic force Common steam for example may be considered as deriving its total elastic energy

the other vapours are ascertained with sufficient precision to enable us to subject them to calculation General equation F L xD  T  o L latent heat D density T temperature corresponding to F When the elastic forces of vapours are doubled or when they sustain a double pressure their interstices are proportion ally diminished We may consider them now as in the condi tion of vapours possessed of greater specific gravities Hence the second portion of heat introduced to give double the 891Dr URES new experimental researches elastic force need not be equal to the first in order to pro duce the double tension This view now given accords with the experiments of Mr WATT alluded to in the beginning of this memoir He found that  the latent heat of steam is less when it is produced under a greater pressure or in a more dense state and greater when it is produced under a less pressure or in a less dense state BERTHOLLET thinks this fact so unaccountable that he has been willing to discard it altogether Whether the view which I have just opened of the relation subsisting between the elastic force density and latent heat of different vapours harmonize with chemical phenomena in general I leave to others to determine It certainly agrees with that unaccount able fact Whatever be the fate of the investigation of the general law now respectfully offered the statement of Mr WATT may be implicitly received under the sanction of his acknowledged sagacity and candour CONCLUSION To the theory of latent heat which like the hydrostatic paradox of Archimedes might have remained for ages a barren though beautiful proposition the fertile genius of that philosopher gave all at once its noblest application and most beneficial influence on human life by his new steam engine After him many minds of the first order for science and ingenuity have offered schemes of farther improvement  Philos Trans vol 84 p 335 39on some of the leading doctrines of caloric c 393 but all either frivolous or abortive with such prophetic judgment had Mr WATT anticipated the happiest form and structure of which it was susceptible Under this conviction it is with much deference that I draw the following practical inferences from the last train of ex periments Since the vapour of alcohol having the same elastic force as the atmosphere contains  of the latent heat of ordinary steam and since its elastic force is doubled at tile o26th degree 6 below the boiling heat of water with perhaps i of additional caloric might we not in particular circumstances employ this vapour for impelling the piston of a steam engine  The condensing apparatus could I imagine be so constructed as to prevent any material loss of the liquid while more than a quadruple power would be obtained from the same size of cylinder at si  with an expenditure of fuel not amounting to one half of what aqueous vapour consumes or the power and fuel would be as 8 to i calling their relation in ordinary steam i to j A considerable engine could thus also be brought within a very moderate compass Possibly after a few operations of the air pump the incon densible gas may be so effectually withdrawn that we might be permitted to detach this mechanism which though essential to common engines takes away one fourth of their power In a distillery in this country or on a sugar estate in the colonies a trial of this plan might perhaps be made with advantage While exercising its mechanical functions of grinding mashing or squeezing the canes it would be converting ordinary into strong spirit for rectification or for394 Dr URtS new experimental researches c the convenience of carriage Might not such an engine be executed on a small scale for many purposes of domestic drudgery It would unquestionably furnish a beautiful illustration in philosophy to make one small portion of liquid by the agency of fire imitate the ceaseless circulation and restless activity of life1 1111 1 t XI  I  I II    I I II ii II I

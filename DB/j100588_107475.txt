IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNLICA ARTICLE STEAM WHILE WE HAVE STILL TO REGRET OUR IGNORANCE OF THOSE EXECUTED BY THE LATTER PHILOSOPHER WITH PROBABLY A MORE COMPLETE APPARATUS AND MORE EXTENSIVE VIEWS WE ARE INDEBTED TO HIM INDEED FOR SOME CURIOUS OBSERVATION ON THE LATENT HEAT OF STEAM AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES WHICH MAKE US LAMENT MORE THE WANT OF THOSE ON THE ELASTIC FORCES THEMSELVES MR DALTON WHOSE PECULIAR SPECULATIS ON CALORIC ND METEOROLOGY LED HIM TO STUDY THE FORMATION AND VARIABLE ELASTICITY OF VAPOUR WITH GREAT ATTENTION HAS SINCE THEN FAVOURED THE WORLD WITH MANY EXCELLENT DISSERTATIONS AND IS NOW RECKONED THE FIRST AUTHORITY ON THE SUBJECT MR DALTONS EXPERIMENTS ON THE STEAM OF WATER WERE CARRIED NO HIGHER THAN ITS ORDINARY BOILING POINT BUT FROM THE OBSERVED PRO GRESSION OF ITS ELASTIC FORCE LE INVESTIGATED A FORMULA AD CALCULATED FROM IT A TABLE FOR THE HIGHER TEMPERATURES IN THE SECOND NUMBER OF THE JOURNAL POLYTECHNIQUE M BETANCOURT AN EMINENT SPANISH ENGINEER LONG RESIDENT AT PARIS PUBLISHED A SET OF EXPERIMENTS ON THE SAME SUBJECT THE RESULTS OF WHICH DIFFER FROM THOSE OF MR DALTON IN MANY PARTICULARS BUT MOST REMARKABLY IN THE HIGHER PART OF THE SCALE HAVING HAD MY MIND OFTEN CALLED TO THIS IMPPORTANT INQUIRY IN THE COURSE OF MY PUBLIC LECTURES ON THE APPLICATIONS OF SCIENCE TO THE ARTS AN APPARATUS OF A VERY SIMPLE NATURE OCCURRED T ME ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO BY WHICH I HOPED TO BE  MANCHESTER MEMOIRS VOL V P563 MDCCCXVIII YDR URES NEW EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES ABLE TO DETERMINE WITH GREAT PRECISION THE ELASTIC FORCES OF VAPOURS AT ANY TEMPERATURE FROM ZERO OF FAHRENHEIT TO A MUCH HIGHER DEGREE OF HEAT THAN EVEN BETANCOURT SEEMS TO HAVE REACHED THE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE SOON AFTER THAT TIME BUT CIRCUMSTANCES HAVE TILL NOW PREVENTED ME FROM ARRANGING THEM FOR PUBLICATION WITH BETANCOURTS APPARATUS I AM NOT ACQUAINTED HAVING SEEN ONLY THE BRIEF TABLE OF RESULTS INSERTED IN OUR SYSTEMATICAL WORKS ON CHEMISTRY PROFESSOR ROBISONS CON SISTED OF A STRONG BOILER OR DIGESTER CONTAINING THE WATER AND FURNISHED WITH THREE SMALL APERTURES THE FIRST RECEIVING THE BULB OF A THERMOMETER THE SECOND COVERED WITH A SAFETY VALVE AND THE THIRD HAVING A BAROMETER TUBE ATTACHED AT FIRST I USED A SIMILAR CONSTRUCTION BUT FINDING IT HAZARDOUS AND SOMEWHAT UNMANAGEABLE IN THE HIGH HEATS AND DIFFICULT TO RENDER AIR TIGHT IN THE LOWER TEMPERATURES I ABANDONED IT AFTER SOME UNSATISFACTORY TRIALS AT THE LOW DEGREES OF HEAT THE VACANT PART OF THE BAROMETER TUBE INTRODUCES ERRORS SINCE IT HAS NOT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE BOILER AND THE BULB OF THE BAROMETER USED IN HIGH HEATS OCCASIONS A SIMILAR FALLACY IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE TRUE ELASTICITIES STILL HOWEVER IT WAS INGENIOUSLY CONCEIVED AND THE RESULTS FURNISH GOOD APPROXIMATIONS CREDITABLE TO THE CELEBRATED EXPERIMENTER THEY AGREE NEARLY WITH THOSE OF BETAN COURT BEING OBTAINED PROBABLY IN A SIMILAR WAY THE METHOD ADOPTED BY MR DALTON IS RECOMMENDED BY AN ELEGANT SIMPLICITY IT IS MERELY

DEPRESSIONS OF THE BAROMETER OR ELASTICITIES OF THE VAPOUR ARE OBTAINED THE ONLY DIFFICULTY IN THIS MODE OF OPERATING IS TO BRING A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF VERTICAL TUBE TO AN UNIFORM TEMPERATURE MR DALTON WELL AWARE OF THIS SOURCE OF ERROR OBVIATED IT IN A GREAT MEASURE BY TAKING A SERIES OF DIFFERENT TUBES DECREASING IN THEIR LENGTHS WITH THE INCREASING EXPANSIONS OF THE VAPOUR AND CONCOMITANT DESCENT OF THE MERCURIAL COLUMN IN SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON THIS PLAN I FOUND IT SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO OBTAIN RESULTS RIGIDLY CORRESPONDING WITH EACH OTHER WHEN THE COLUMN OF VAPOUR EXPOSED IN THE BAROMETER TUBE TO THE INFLUENCE OF SURROUNDING HEAT EXCEEDED TWO INCHES IN LENGTH M BIOT IN HIS SYSTEM OF PHYSICS RECENTLY PUBLISHED WHILE HE ADOPTS MR DALTONS RESULTS AS THE BASIS OF HIS REASONING TREATS FULLY OF THIS DIFFICULTY AND SUGGESTS AN INGENIOUS MEANS OF AVOIDING IT  WE HAVE HAD OCCASION SEVERAL TIMES TO  REMARK SAYS HE THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF A MASS OF LIQUID  WHICH COOLS IN THE AIR IS NOT ENTIRELY THE SAME AT THE BOTTOM AS IT IS AT THE TOP OF THE VESSEL BECAUSE THE COLDER PARTICLES  SUBSIDE INTO THE LOWER STRATA BY THE EXCESS OF THEIR WEIGHT THUS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE COLUMN OF HOT WATER WHICH  SURROUNDS THE TUBE IN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT CANNOT  BE RIGOROUSLY UNIFORM THROUGHOUT ITS WHOLE HEIGHT WE E MAY ENDEAVOUR TO RENDER IT EQUAL BY AGITATING AND MINGLING  THE DIFFERENT STRATA OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED BUT THIS WOULD 34T34 DR URES NEWV EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES  BE ATTENDED WITH NO LITTLE DIFFICULTY IT WOULD BE BETTER TO HAVE SEVERAL THERMOMETERS SUSPENDED AT DIFFERENT HEIGHTS IN THE BODY OF THE WATER AND TO TAKE THE ARITHMETICAL MEAN OFTHEIR INDICATIONS OR OTHERWISE WHICH WOULD PROBABLY  BE MORE EXACT WE MIGHT EMPLOY A THERMOMETER HAVING A CYLINDRICAL BULB EQUAL IN LENGTH TO THE COLUMN OF VAPOUR  IT WOULD THEN BE NECESSARY THAT THE COLUMN OF WATER SHOULD RISE SUFFICIENTLY ABOVE THIS VAPOUR TO ALLOW THE THERMO METER BULB TO BE EQUALLY IMMERSED OR WE MUST MAKE ON ITS INDICATIONS THE SMALL CORRECTION MENTIONED P 59 IN  ORDER TO REDUCE THE TEMPERATURE OF THE CYLINDER OF MERCURY TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE RESERVOIR THE EMPLOYMENT OF SUCH A THERMOMETER MAY APPEAR AT FIRST SIGHT SUFFICIENTLY  DIFFICULT SINCE IT SEEMS THAT THE LENGTH OF THE CYLINDRICAL RESERVOIR MUST BE VERY CONSIDERABLE IF THE ELASTIC FORCE OF THE VAPOUR BE GREAT HE THEN PROCEEDS TO SHOW HOW THIS DIFFICULTY MAY BE OB VIATED AS INDEED IT HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN BY MR DALTON BY TAKING BAROMETER TUBES SUCCESSIVELY SHORTENED AS THE FORCE OF THE STEAM IS AUGMENTED BY HEAT HE PROPOSES TO USE FOUR BETWEEN THE FREEZING AND BOILING POINTS OF WATER EACH BEING TWO DECIMETERS OR NEARLY 8 INCHES LONG AND THE THERMOMETER BULB HAVING ALSO THAT LENGTH THE PLAN WHICH I IMAGINED AS IT COMPLETELY OBVIATES THE SOURCE OF ERRORS ARISING FROM THE LARGE AND VARIABLE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE VAPOUR SUPERSEDES THE NECESSITY OF EMPLOYING M BOTRS SINGULAR REMEDY IT LIKEWISE AVOIDS OTHER COMPLICATIONS

THE RELATION OF THE AREAS EXPERIMENTALLY DETERMINED THEN THE RISE OF THE QUICKSILVER ABOVE L WOULD BE ONE HALF OR A KNOWN SUBMULTIPLE OF THE TOTAL DEPRESSION EQUIVALENT TO THE ADDITIONAL ELASTICITY OF THE VAPOUR AT 40 ABOVE THAT AT 32 SINCE THE DEPRESSIONS HOWEVER FOR O3 OR 4O DEGREES IN THIS PART OF THE SCALE ARE EXCEEDINGLY SMALL ONE HALF OF THE QUANTITY CAN SCARCELY BE ASCERTAINED WITH SUITABLE PRECISION EVEN AFTER TAKING THE ABOVE PRECAUTIONS AND BESIDES THE OTHER SOURCES OF ERROR OR AT LEAST EMBARRASS MENT FROM THE INEQUALITIES OF THE TUBE AND FROM THE LENGTHEN ING SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE VAPOUR AS THE TEMPERATURE ASCENDS RENDER THIS METHOD OF REDUCTION VERY INELIGIBLE BY THE OTHER PLAN WE AVOID ALL THESE EVILS FOR WHATEVER ADDITIONAL ELASTICITY WE COMMUNICATE TO THE VAPOUR ABOVE  IT

ITS TOP I FOUND IT TO BE CONVENIENT IN THIS CASE AFTER OBSERVING THAT THE COLUMN OF VAPOUR HAD ATTAINED ITS PRIMITIVE MAGNITUDE TO NOTE DOWN THE TEMPERATURE WITH THE ALTITUDE OF IHECOLUIN  THEN IMMEDIATELY TO POURIN A MEASURED QUANTITY OF MERCURY NEARLY EQUAL TO THREE VERTICAL INCHES AND TO WAIT TILL THE SLOW PROGRESS OF THE HEATING AGAIN BROUGHT THE VAPOUR IN EQUILIBRIO WITH THIS NEW PRESSURE WHICH AT FIRST HAD PUSHED THE MERCURY WITHIN THE PLATINA RING AT I WHEN THE LOWER SURFACE OF THE MERCURY WAS AGAIN A TANGENT TO THIS RING THE TEMPERATURE AND ALTITUDE WERE BOTH INSTANTLY OBSERVED THIS MODE OF CONDUCTING THE PROCESS WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPERIMENTAL TEMPERATURES BEING VERY OFTEN ODD AND FRACTIONAL NUMBERS I PRESENT THEM TO THE PUBLIC AS THEY WERE RECORDED ON THE INSTANT IN THAT PARTICULAR REPETITION OF THE EXPERIMENT WHICH I CONSIDER MOST ENTITLED TO CONFIDENCE TO TRIM AND FASHION THE RESULTS INTO AN ORDERLY LOOKING SERIES WOULD HAVE BEEN AN EASY TASK  BUT IN MY OPINION THIS IS A SPECIES OF DE CEPTION VERY INJURIOUS TO THE CAUSE OF SCIENCE AND A DEVIATION FROM THE RIGID TRUTH OF OBSERVATION WHICH OUGHT NEVER TO BE MADE FOR ANY HYPOTHESIS WE SHALL AFTERWARDS HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES OF EXPOSING THE FALLACY OF SUCH PREMATURE GEO METRICAL REFINEMENTS THE THERMOMETERS WERE CONSTRUCTED BY CREIGHTON WITH HIS WELL KNOWN NICETY AND THE DIVISIONS WERE

DALTONS EXPERIMENTS AND FROM THIS SINGLE ANALOGY CHIEFLY HE LAID DOWN THE GENERAL LAW THAT THE VARIATION IN THE FORCE OF VAPOUR FROM ALL LIQUIDS  IS THE SAME FOR THE SAME VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE RECKON  ING FROM VAPOUR OF ANY GIVEN FORCE MY EXPERIMENTS ON OIL OF TURPENTINE AND PETROLEUM SHOW THE FALLACY OF THIS GENERALIZATION IF WE RECKON THE COMMON THERMOMETRIC SCALE A TOLERABLY CORRECT

PARADOXICAL THOUGH JUST EXPRESSION IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS PECULIAR THERMOMETRIC IDEAS MR DALTON HAS ABROGATED THE ABOVE LAW WHICH HE HAD HIMSELF FRAMED THOUGH IT IS CURIOUS TO OBSERVE IN SOME

SINCE AS 282 NEW SCALE CORRESPOND TO 31105 FAHR THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS TO 43 INCHES BEING MORE THAN ONE FOURTH OF THE TOTAL ELASTIC FORCE GENERATED AT THAT HIGH TEMPERATURE WHEN WE TURN OUR ATTENTION TO ETHER WE FIND THE DISCRE PANCIES IF POSSIBLE LESS EASY TO RECONCILE AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 212 FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE OLD AND NEW SCALES MEET FOR THE LAST TIME THE FORCE OF ITS VAPOUR BY THE GEOMETRICAL PROGRESSION EXCEEDS THAT FOUND FROM EXPERIMENT BY THE ENORMOUS QUANTITY OF 67 INCHES AND A HALF AMOUNTING TO TWO FIFTHS OF THE WHOLE ELASTIC FORCE EVOLVED MAY WE VENTURE THEN TO CONCLUDE FROM THESE MULTIPLIED COMPARISONS THAT THE PROGRESSIONS OF ELASTICITY IN VAPOURS TAUGHT BY MR DALTON ARE GEOMETRICAL FICTIONS INTENDED TO QUADRATE WITH HIS NOTIONS CONCERNING TEMPERATURE BUT NOT CONSONANT WITH THE LAWS OR PHENOMENA OF NATURE  WITHIN A MODERATE COMPASS INDEED IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO SUIT THE RATIO OF ELASTIC FORCE AND THE THERMOMETRIC GRADUATION TO EACH OTHER BUT THE PROSECUTION OF THE ENQUIRY INTO RANGES MORE REMOTE DETECTS THE FALLACY OF SUCH HYPOTHETICAL ADAPTA7DR URES NEW EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES TIONS MY EXPERIMENTS ON THE VAPOURS OF WATER ALCOHOL AND ETHER SEEM TO SHOW THAT THE RATIO OF TENSION DECREASES IN A CERTAIN PROGRESSION AS THE TEMPERATURE AUGMENTS WERE THE RATIOS 1E2 192 12 C WHICH ARE SEEN TO APPLY SO WELL TO AQUEOUS VAPOUR FOR A CONSIDERABLE RANGE ABOVE 212 TO BE ADOPTED AS REPRESENTING THE PROGRESSIVE MARCH OF NATURE IT WOULD LEAD TO THE ABSURD CONCLUSION THAT AT 40O ABOVE THE BOILING POINT OR 45S F THE FARTHER INFLUX OF CALORIC WOULD OCCASION A DIMINUTION OF ELASTICITY IN THE STEAM THE TRUTH HOWEVER IS THAT AT THE G3STH DEGREE INDICATIONS OF A DIVER GENCE BEGIN TO APPEAR BETWEEN THE TWO LINES OF EXPERIMENT AND CALCULATION WHICH HAD RUN FOR SO LONG A SPACE NEARLY PARALLEL THE CURVE REPRESENTING THE EXPANSIVE FORCE OF STEAM I CONSIDER TO BE LOGARITHMIC IN WHICH THE RATIOS AS ORDINATES CONTINUALLY DIMINISH WITHOUT EVER VANISHING OR COMING TO AN EQUALITY THE AXIS IS AN ASYMPTOTE TO THE CURVE AS IN THE ATMOSPHERICAL LOGARITHMIC CHAPTER II ON THERMOMETRIC ADMEASUREMENT AND THE DOCTRINE OF CAPACITY BEFORE INQUIRING INTO THE RELATIVE QUANTITIES OF HEAT CON TAINED IN DIFFERENT VAPOURS AT THE SAME TENSION IT WILL BE PROPER TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY AND FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION CONCERNING THE MEASURE OF TEMPERATURE IT IS SINGULAR THAT NOT ONE EXPERIMENTAL FACT HAS BEEN ADVANCED CAPABLE OF SETTLING THIS QUESTION AMID THE CONTENDING OPINIONS OF CHEMI CAL PHILOSOPHERS MR DALTON HAS IN PARTICULAR EXERTED ALL THE RESOURCES OF HIS GENIUS AND SCIENCE TO DESTROY OUR CONFI DENCE IN THE THERMOMETRIC SCALE OUR SOLE GUIDE IN THE VAST 7ON SOME OF THE LEADING DOCTRINES OF CALORIC C 371 AND INTRICATE PROVINCE OF CALORIC WHILE I HOPE TO BE ABLE TO FIX THIS NOW INDETERMINATE POINT BY A NEW TRAIN OF INVESTIGA TIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO PROVE THE ENTIRE FALLACY OF HIS DOCTRINE OF TEMPERATURE THE KEYSTONE OF HIS SYSTEM OF HEAT I DO NOT MEAN TO AFFIRM THE ABSOLUTE UNIFORMITY OF EXPANSION IN BODIES BY EQUAL INCREMENTS OF THAT POWER I THINK IT INDEED HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT EVERY SPECIES OF MATTER BOTH SOLID AND LIQUID FOLLOWS AN INCREASING RATE IN ITS ENLARGEMENT BY CALORIC EACH PORTION THAT ENTERS INTO A BODY MUST WEAKEN THE ANTAGONIST FORCE COHESION AND MUST THEREFORE RENDER MORE EFFICACIOUS THE OPERATION OF THE NEXT PORTION THAT IS INTRODUCED LET IOOO REPRESENT THE COHESIVE ATTRACTION AT THE COMMENCEMENT THEN AFTER RECEIVING ONE INCREMENT OF CALORIC IT WILL BECOME IOOO   999 SINCE THE NEXT UNIT OF THAT DIVELLENT AGENT WILL HAVE TO COMBAT ONLY THIS DIMINISHED COHESIVE FORCE IT WILL PRODUCE AN EFFECT GREATER THAN THE FIRST IN THE PROPORTION OF LOO TO 999 AND SO ON IN CONTINUED PROGRESSION THAT THE INCREASING RATIO IS HOWEVER GREATLY LESS THAN MR DALTON MAINTAINS MAY I THINK BE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED ACCORDING TO HIS TABLE OF EQUAL INCREMENTS OF TEMPERATURE VOL I P 14 NEW SYSTEM WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING

THEREFORE NOT APPLICABLE TO SOLID BODIES THIS IS INDEED IMPLIED IN ITS ENUNCIATION IN P 4 AFTER ASSIGNING REASONS HE STATES THAT FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES WE MAY ADOPT THE NOTION OF THE EQUABLE EXPANSION OF SOLIDS NOW I AM PREPARED TO PROVE EITHER THAT THE EXPANSION OF SOLIDS PARTAKES OF THE ABOVE INEQUABILITY OF LIQUIDS WHICH NOBODY IMAGINES AND FOR WHICH NO REASON EVEN HYPOTHETICAL CAN BE ASSIGNED OR WHICH IS THE ONLY ALTERNATIVE THAT HOMO GENEOUS SOLIDS AND MERCURY PROCEED ALMOST EXACTLY PARI PASSU IN THEIR RATES OF EXPANSION BY HEAT THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH JUSTIFY THIS ASSERTION WERE MADE BY ME ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO AND WERE THEN EXHIBITED TO MANY OF MY CHEMICAL FRIENDS AS ALSO IN MY PUBLIC LECTURES BUT A WISH TO RENDER THE SERIES MORE COMPLETE HAS INDUCED ME TO WITHHOLD THEM FROM THE PUBLIC EYE TILL REQUISITE LEISURE COULD BE AFFORDED FOR THIS PURPOSE THEY WERE PERFORMED WITH A PYROMETER OF PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION IN AN OBLONG TROUGH FILLED WITH MELTING ICE A STRONG BAR OF SWEDISH IRON WAS PLACED FROM WHICH PROJECTED AT RIGHT ANGLES FOUR INFLEXIBLE IRON ARMS ATTACHABLE BY POWERFUL SCREWS TO ANY PART OF THE BAR THE ARMS NEAREST THE EXTREMITIES OF THE BAR CARRIED EACH A FINE MICROMETER MICROSCOPE MADE BY THAT ADMIRABLE ARTIST MR TROUGHTON THE OTHER TWO ARMS WERE INCURVATED DOWN WARDS AT THEIR EXTREMITIES WHICH SUPPORTED A METALLIC OR OTHER ROD THIS WAS FIXED BY TWO PINCHING SCREWS AT ONE END BUT LAY LOOSE ON A FRICTION ROLLER AT THE OTHER THE LOOSE END BORE AN ELEVATED INDEX THE CURVATURE OF THESE TWO ARMS WASON SOME OF THE LEADING DOCTRINES OF CALORIC C SUCH AS TO ALLOW THEIR EXTREMITIES WITH THE ATTACHED ROD TO BE PLUNGED BENEATH THE SURFACE OF OIL OR WATER ABOUT AN INCH CONTAINED IN A COPPER TROUGH THIS WAS PLACED PARALLEL TO THE LARGE TROUGH AND A FEW INCHES DISTANT FROM IT THE COPPER VESSEL WAS SLOWLY AND EQUABLY HEATED BY A SERIES OF ARGAND LAMPS PLACED BENEATH ONE MICROMETER WATCHED A POINT PROJECTING FROM THE ARM THAT HELD THE FIXED EXTREMITY OF THE ROD THE OIL WAS CAREFULLY AGITATED DURING THE APPLICATION OF THE HEAT AND THE BULBS OF THREE THERMOME TERS MUTUALLY COMPARABLE WERE IMMERSED INTO IT AT REGULAR DISTANCES THE MICROMETERS WERE SCREENED FROM THE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAT THEY RENDERED THE 200O OF AN INCH DISCERNIBLE AND EVEN A SMALLER QUANTITY BY AN EXPERIENCED EYE A ROD OF PURE SWEDISH IRON OR OF SUCH PURE COPPER AS JEWELLERS

LIQUID IN THE TROUGH WAS AT 32 THE VALUE AND TRUTH OF THE MICROMETRICAL INDICATIONS HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ASCERTAINED BY VIEWING THROUGH THE MICROSCOPES A GIVEN SURFACE OR APERTURE MOVED LATERALLY SO AS TO MAKE ITS IMAGE SUCCESSIVELY COINCIDE WITH THE DIFFERENT POINTS OF THE INTERIOR NOTCHED SCALE HEAT BEING NOW APPLIED THE PROGRESSIVE MARCH OF THE INDEX ACROSS THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE MICROMETER MICROSCOPE WAS CLOSELY OBSERVED AND ITS POSITION WRITTEN DOWN AT INTERVALS OF 10O OR GO OF THE FAHR THERMOMETER BUT AS THE PYRO METRICAL DETAILS WILL APPEAR IN A SEPARATE MEMOIR ON THE EX PANSIONS OF BODIES I SHALL STATE HERE MERELY WHAT CONCERNS THE PRESENT SUBJECT 873DR URES NEW EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IF WE DENOMINATE THE ABSOLUTE ELONGATION OF THE HEATED METALLIC ROD FROM 3TO TO L IO THEN ITS ELONGATION FROM I 2 TO 19O FROM 212O TO 302  FROM 830 TO 392 FROM 3S9 TO 48E WAS IN EACH SUCCESSIVE INTERVAL OF 9O F AS NEARLY AS POS SIBLE TO ALSO THE SLIGHT IRREGULARITIES INCIDENT TO ALL DELICATE EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATIONS BEING OFTEN IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS IN DIFFERENT REPETITIONS OF THE SAME EXPERIMENT OR THOSE WHICH MANIFESTED THEMSELVES IN THE ASCENDING OR ELONGATING RANGE WERE NEUTRALIZED SO TO SPEAK BY OTHERS OF AN INVERSE NATURE WHICH APPEARED IN THE COOLING RETROCESSION HERE THE MOVEMENTS OF THE LIQUID MERCURY AND OF THE SOLID ROD BY HEAT PROCEEDED PARIPASSU THROUGH A VERY GREAT EXTENT OF TEM PERATURE LET US NOW RECOLLECT THAT THESE 5 INCREMENTS WHICH ON OUR THERMOMETER ARE EQUIVALENT TO 5 X 9O  450 AND WHICH ALTOGETHER PRODUCE FIVE TIMES THE ELONGATION THAT THE FIRST INTERVAL OCCASIONS CONSTITUTE ON MR DALTONS SCALE ONLY 350 IF WE CALL THE FIRST INTERVAL GIVEN BY THIS PHILOSO PHER 1OO THEN THE FOUR SUCCEEDING INTERVALS CONTAIN A RANGE OF TEMPERATURE ON HIS SCHEME OF ONLY TWO AND A HALF TIMES THE FIRST AND THEREFORE ONLY TWO AND A HALF TIMES ADDITIONAL ELONGATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN PRODUCED INSTEAD OF FOUR TIMES AS FOUND BY EXPERIMENT  SINCE FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES UNIFORM INCREMENTS OF BULK OR EXPANSIONS OF SOLIDS BY HEAT CORRESPOND TO UNIFORM INCREMENTS OF THIS POWER  THEN EACH OF OUR OLD SUCCESSIVE INTERVALS OF 9GO MAY FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES BE HELD TO CORRESPOND TO EQUAL INCREMENTS OF TEMPERATURE MR DALTONS INTERVALS FROM 3G TO 489 FAHR ARE AS BEFORE GIVEN 1OO4 776 6309 557 5O05  350 1 NOW IF WE CALL THE FIRST QUANTITY LOO IT

DIMINUTION OF EFFECT WAS OBSERVED IN THE EXPERI MENTS FROM 39 TO 482 F THE ROD ELONGATED AS MUCH AS FROM 3S 1220 OR DOUBLE THE QUANTITY COMPATIBLE WITH THE DALTONIAN HYPOTHESIS THUS THEREFORE WE HAVE A RIGID AND I THINK UNANSWERABLE DEMONSTRATION OF THE GENERAL CORRECTNESS OF THE COMMON SCALE OF TEMPERATURE AND OF THE EXTREME INACCURACY AND INAPPLICABILITY OF MR DALTONS GEOMETRICAL SUBSTITUTE SHOULD THE PRECEDING STATEMENT LEAVE ANY DOUBT OR OBSCURITY CONCERNING THE LEGITIMACY OF THE INFERENCE NOW DRAWN I TRUST IT WILL BE ENTIRELY REMOVED WHEN THE DETAILS OF THE EXPERIMENTS ARE PUBLISHED WITH DRAWINGS OF THE APPARATUS IN MY TREATISE ON PYROMETRY YET THOUGH THE MERCURY IN THE THERMOMETER TUBE MOVE PARIPASSU WITH A METALLIC ROD DEEMED UNIFORM IN ITS EXPAN SION IT DOES NOT PROVE PERFECTLY EQUAL UNIFORMITY OF EXPANSION TO BELONG TO THE MERCURY IT WILL SEEM NO DOUBT A PARA DOXICAL ASSERTION THAT OF TWO BODIES MARCHING TOGETHER HAND IN HAND ONE OF THEM MAY HAVE AN EQUABLE PACE WHILE THAT OF THE OTHER IS REGULARLY BUT VERY SLOWLY ACCELERATED YET I THINK THE POSITION JUST IT PROCEEDS FROM A CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE THERMOMETER SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS BUT WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE ESCAPED OUR SYSTEMATIC WRITERS I DO NOT REST THE PRO POSITION ON ANY IMPERFECTION OF WORKMANSHIP OR SUPPOSED IRREGULARITY IN THE EXPANSIONS OF THE GLASS 375376 DR URES NEW EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES LET US TAKE

LIQUID THE PART ACTUALLY EXPOSED TO THE HEAT AND BY WHOSE EXPANSION THE COLUMN ON THE SCALE IS SUPPORTED IS ONLY F OF THE INITIAL MASS AUGMENT THE HEAT OF THE OIL TILL THE INSTRUMENT INDICATE 9S WE KNOW THAT THERE REMAINS NOW UNDER THE IMMEDIATE INFLUENCE OF THE HEAT F NEARLY OF THE ORIGINAL WEIGHT OF MERCURY AND FINALLY AT 572 ONLY ABOUT  REST IN THE IMMERSED PART OF THE STEM AND BULB R OR  PARTS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS NO LONGER SUBJECTED TO THE POWER OF CALORIC IF THE THERMOMETER STEM WERE RECURVED NEAR THE BULB THE MERCURY IN THE STEM PLACED HORI ZONTALLY WOULD BE COLD AND THIS PROPOSITION WOULD BE ALMOST EXACTLY TRUE NOW SINCE THE CALIBRE AND DIVISIONS ARE UNIFORM THE CAPACITY OF THE TUBE FROMT THE POINT MARKED L2I TO THAT MARKED 39S AND AGAIN FROM THIS TO THAT OPPOSITE TO

OF 6O PARTS AT THE MIDDLE POINT 2 X 180 IS SUPPORTED BY THAT OF 61 AND AT 12 THERE ARE 62 PARTS OF MERCURY TO SUSTAIN 18O IN THE TUBE OR TO PUT IT IN ANOTHER FORM THESE THREE SUCCESSIVE SPACES ON THE SCALE ARE EQUAL THE FIRST PORTION OF MERCURY IS PRO TRUDED INTO IT BY THE EXPANSION OF 69 PARTS IN TLE BULB THE SECOND PORTION BY THE EXPANSION OF 61 AND THE THIRD BY THAT OF 6O THEREFOREIF THESE THREE THERNLOMETRIC INTERVALS OF 180 EACH OF WHICH HOLDS AN EQUAL MEASURE OF MERCURY CONTAIN ALSO EQUAL INCREMENTS OF TEMPERATURE AS DENOTED BY THE EQUAL INCREMENTS OF A METALLIC ROD THEN THESE THREE EQUAL EFFECTS ARE PRODUCED FROM THE UNEQUAL QUANTITIES OF MERCURY 62 61 60 THIS LIQUID THEN MUST HAVE AN INCREASING RATE OF EXPAN SION THE INVERSE OF THESE NUMBERS FOR EVERY 180 OF THE SCALE OR   4I THAT IS TO SAY 60 PARTS AT 572 DO THE SAME WORK BY THE SAME POWER OF CALORIC AS 61 AT 392O AND 6S AT 212 I BELLEVE THIS TO BE THE REAL NATURE OF MERCURIAL EXPANSION AND THE TRUE CONDITION OF THE THERMOMETER WHICH IS AN EQUABLE MEASURER OF HEAT BECAUSE THE MERCURY POSSESSES THE ABOVE INCREASING RATE OF EXPANSION WERE THE MERCURY ON THE CONTRARY ABSOLUTELY UNIFORM IN ITS AUGMENTATIONS OF VOLUME BY EQUAL INCREMENTS OF HEAT THEN FOR AN INSTRUMENT WHOSE BULB ALONE IN PRACTICE CAN BE IMMERSED THE THREE ABOVE RANGES SHOULD HAVE THE CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE SCALE SHORTENED IN THE SUCCESSIVE

WITH THE PRE CEDING INVESTIGATION DR CRAWFORD AND DE LUC TRIED TO VERIFY THE JUSTNESS OF THE THERMOMETRIC INDICATIONS BY MIXING TOGETHER WATER AT 212 AND 32 WHEN THE FORMER FOUND 122 AND THE LATTER

SCALE BY OTHER EXPERIMENTS WHICH WERE HOWEVER OF RATHER AN EQUIVOCAL IMPORT BOTH OF THE ABOVE RESULTS HAVE BEEN CONDEMNED AND REJECTED BY MR DALTON HE STATES THE TRUE MEAN TEMPERATURE TO BE NOT LA1 NOR EVEN 19 BUT 1 O0 FOR THIS DEVIATION THE REASONS WHICH HE ASSIGNS APPEAR INDEPENDENTLY OF ALL ARGUMENTS DERIVED FROM OTHER QUARTERS TO BE IN THEMSELVES INCONCLUSIVE HE SAYS THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ABOVE MIXTURE OUGHT TO BE FOUND ABOVE THE MEAN 122  WATER OF THESE TWO TEMPE  RATURES 382 AND 12 BEING MIXED LOSES ABOUT  OF ITS BULK THIS CONDENSATION OF ITS VOLUME MUST EXPEL A QUANTITY OF HEAT AND RAISE THE TEMPERATURE ABOVE THE MEAN P 7 AGAIN P 50 THAT WATER INCREASES IN ITS CAPACITY FOR HEAT WITH THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE ICON  SIDER DEMONSTRABLE FROM THE FOLLOWING ARGUMENTS IST A  THAT CONDENSATION OF VOLUME IN A LIQUID IS NO PROOF OF THE EXPULSION OF HEAT IS SHOWN IN MY ESSAY ON SULPHURIC ACID 378ON SOME OF THE LEADING DOCTRINES OF CALORIC   C MEASURE OF WATER AT ANY ONE

FOUND TO INCREASE IN THEIR CAPACITY FOR HEAT WITH  THE INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE ADMITTING THE FORCE OF THESE ARGUMENTS IT FOLLOWS THAT WHEN WATER OF 32 AND 912 ARE  MIXED AND GIVE A TEMPERATURE DENOTED BY 19 OF THE COMMON THERMOMETER WE MUST CONCLUDE THAT THE TRUE MEAN TEMPERATURE IS SOMEWHERE BELOW THAT DEGREE I HAVE ALREADY ASSIGNED THE REASON WHY I PLACE THE MEAN AT IO NOW THE ONLY REASON I CAN ELSEWHERE FIND IS DERIVED FROM HIS GENERAL LAW6 THAT ALL HOMOGENEOUS LIQUIDS EXPAND AS THE SQUARE OF THE TEMPERATURE FROM THE POINT OF GREATEST DENSITY OR CONGELATION IN P 7 HE VENTURES TO ASSERT NOTHING MORE THAN  THAT IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THE TRUE MEAN TEMPE RATURE BETWEEN 32 AND 212 MAY BE AS LOW AS 110O FAH  RENHEITO SATISFIED FROM MY PYROMETRICAL EXPERIMENTS THAT HIS GENERAL HYPOTHESIS OF THE EXPANSION OF LIQUIDS BEING AS THE  FOR THE ENTIRE FALLACY OF THIS REASONING SEE MY ESSAY JUST QUOTED EXPANSION OF VOLUME SHOULD BY MR D INCREASE CAPACITY AND DIMINISH TEMPERATURE THE

MEAN BETWEEN 3O AND E2 CANNOT BE ALLOWED BUT LET US EXAMINE ON THEIR OWN MERITS THE PRECEDING ARGUMENTS AGAINST DR CRAWFORD AND DE LUCS VERIFICATION OF THE MEAN TEMPERATURE BETWEEN THAT OF FREEZING AND BOILING WATER THE REASONING DERIVES ITS SOLE FORCE FROM THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CAPACITY OF WATER FOR HEAT INCREASES AS ITS TEMPERA TURE IS RAISED THERE IS ADDUCED HOWEVER NO FACT IN THE LEAST DECISIVE ON THIS MAIN POINT WHAT ANALOGY IS THERE BETWEEN THE ENTIRE CHANGE OF FORM AND CONSTITUTION SUFFERED BY AN INCON DENSIBLE LIQUID ON BECOMING AN ELASTIC VAPOUR AND THE PRO GRESSIVE HEATING OF THE LIQUID ITSELF OR ALTHOUGH DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID AND OTHER LIQUIDS SHOULD INCREASE IN THEIR SPECIFIC CALORIC ON BEING HEATED WHICH HOWEVER HAS NOT BEEN SATISFACTORILY DEMONSTRATED ARE WE TO ASSERT THAT WATER MUST DO SO TOO  IT IS A MATTER OF SURPRIZE TO ME THAT A PHILOSOPHER OF MR DALTONS JUDGEMENT AND ACUTENESS SHOULD HAVE PRESSED SUCH INCONCLUSIVE ANALOGIES INTO HIS SERVICE HE KNEW WELL THAT WATER IS ENDOWED WITH SOME CURIOUS PECULIA RITIES WHEN COMPARED WITH OTHER LIQUIDS OR ANOMALIES AS WE IDLY STILE THEM  FOR THEY CONSTITUTE NO ANOMALY IN NATURE BUT WISELY FIT WATER FOR PERFORMING THE IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS ASSIGNED TO IT IN THE ECONOMY OF OUR GLOBE IN A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS CAREFULLY CONDUCTED ON THE RELATIVE CAPACITIES FOR HEAT OF WATER SULPHURIC ACID OIL OF TURPENTINE AND SPERMACETI OIL PUBLISHED IN MY ESSAY ON HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND THE CHLORIDES IT SEEMS TO BE DIRECTLY DEMONSTRATED THAT THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF WATER DOES NOT INCREASE BUT ACTUALLY DIMINISHES AND THAT VERY CONSPICUOUSLY AS ITS 380OT SOME OF THE LEADING DOCTRINES OF CALORIC C 38 TEMPERATURE RISES IT IS THERE PROVED THAT FROM SIO TO 150O FAHR THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF OIL IS TO THAT OF WATER AS 697 TO 1OOO AND FROM 15OO TO 90G AS 513 TO O0OO THE SAME PRO PORTIONAL DIFFERENCE OF RELATION IS EXHIBITED BY THE OTHER TWO LIQUIDS NOW WERE THE PHENOMENON OCCASIONED BY THE OIL OF VITRIOL COMMON OIL AND OIL OF TURPENTINE INCREASING IN THEIR CAPACITIES FOR HEAT IN A STILL MORE RAPID RATIO THAN WATER WE SHOULD UNDOUBTEDLY EXPECT FROM THE INNATE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC HEATS OF THESE THREE SUBSTANCES TO FIND THAT THEY WOULD MOVE INDEPENDENTLY ON EACH OTHER OR AT DIFFERENT RATES BUT THEIR UNIFORM ADVANCE TOGETHER WHILE WATER ALONE VARIES IN THIS RESPECT SHOWS DISTINCTLY THAT IN THE WATER RESIDES THE CAUSE OF THE VARIATION THIS REASONING MAY BE ILLUSTRATED IN MANY WAYS BUT BY NOTHING MORE CLEARLY THAN THE EXPLODED ASTRONOMICAL SYSTEM OF THE DIURNAL AND ANNUAL MOVEMENTS OF THE SUN AND FIXED STARS IN SUPPORT OF WHICH VERY EXTRAVAGANT HYPOTHESES HAD TO BE CONTRIVED THE SINGLE FACT OF THE MOTION OF THE EARTH ONCE ADMITTED REDUCED THE PTOLEMAIC CHAOS TO ORDER IF IN LIKE MANNER WE SHOULD SUPPOSE AN INCREASING RATIO IN THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF WATER THEN WE MUST ALSO SUPPOSE A MUCH MORE RAPID INCREASE IN THE RATIOS OF THE ABOVE THREE SUBSTANCES ALTHOUGH THEIR INDIVIDUAL SPECIFIC HEATS ARE GREATLY INFERIOR TO THAT OF WATER OUGHT NOT THAT BODY WHICH HAS OF ALL OTHERS THE MOST DECIDED RELATION TO HEAT OR HIGHEST SPECIFIC HEAT TO HAVE ALSO ITS RATIO MOST DECIDEDLY OR RAPIDLY AUGMENTED  IN ADOPTING THE INCREASING SPECIFIC HEAT OF WATER WE MUST FARTHER ASSUME THAT HOWEVER DIFFERENT THE INITIAL SPECIFIC HEATS OF THE ABOVE THREE LIQUIDS MAY BE YET WHILE THEY POSSESS ALL THE SAME RATE OF INCREASE WATER ALONE HAS A DIFFERENT ONE AN INADMISSIBLE SUPPOSITION ALL882 DR URES NEW EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES THESE DIFFICULTIES AND CONTRADICTIONS ARE REMOVED AT ONCE BY THE EXPERIMENTAL FACT THAT WATER IS ENDOWED WITH A DE CREASING RATIO IN ITS CAPACITY FOR CALORIC AS ITS TEMPERATURE IS AUGMENTED SINCE FINISHING THE ABOVE RESEARCHES ON SPECIFIC HEAT I HAVE BEEN LED TO EXAMINE ATTENTIVELY THE SYSTEMATIC ACCOUNTS OF THIS SUBJECT IN OUR CHEMICAL TREATISES AND I FIND THAT BER THOLLET WITH A SAGACITY PECULIAR TO HIMSELF HAD ANTICIPATED FROM THE CHEMICAL CONSTITUTION OF BODIES SUCH AN EXPERIMENTAL RESULT AS I HAVE RECENTLY OBTAINED THOUGH THE STATEMENTS THEN PREVALENT ALL MILITATED AGAINST HIS VIEWS C IF CALORIC S OBEY THE USUAL LAWS OF ATTRACTION WHEN IT IS IN SMALL  QUANTITY RELATIVE TO THE BODY TO WHICH IT IS UNITED IT WILL C ENTER INTO MORE INTIMATE COMBINATION AND HENCE THE ELAS TICITY OR EXPANSIVE ENERGY OF IT ON WHICH TEMPERATURE DEPENDS MAY BE OVERCOME AND A LARGER QUANTITY BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A GIVEN TEMPERATURE HENCE THE QUANTITY OF C CALORIC CONTAINED IN BODIES IN THE FIRST STAGE OF TEMPERATURE MAY BE GREATER THAN IT WILL BE HIGHER IN THE SCALE IN THE ESSAY ABOVE REFERRED TO I HAVE SHOWN THAT THIS CIR CUMSTANCE IN WATER RENDERS IT PECULIARLY QUALIFIED FOR SERVING AS THE MAGAZINEE AND EQUALIZER OF TE TEMPERATURE OF THE GLOBE SINCE AT OUR ORDINARY ATMOSPHERICAL HEATS IT POS SESSES THE GREATEST CAPACITY FOR CALORIC SMALL VARIATIONS IN ITS TEMPRERATURE GIVE IT A GREAT MODIFYING POWER OVER THE CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR ALTHOUGH THE DOCTRINE OF FINAL CAUSES BE NO SAFE GUIDE TO THE DISCOVERY OF UNKNOWN TRUTHS YET WVEN IT CONCURS WITH EXPERIMENT WE MAY DEEN IT AN AGREEABLE CONFIRMATION THIS IS FINELY ILLUSTRATED BY COUNT RUMFORDS SPECULATIONS ON THE MAXIMUM DENSITY OF WATER BEING PLACEDON SOME OF THE LEADING DOCTRINES OF CALORIC C 383 SEVERAL DEGRES ABOVE ITS POINT OF CONGELATION A FACT WHICH DOES NOT HOLD WITH REGARD TO ANY OTHER HOMOGENEOUS LIQUID IF THE SPECIFIC HEAT OF WATER THEN DIMINISH AS ITS TEMPERA TURE ADVANCES FROM THE FREEZING TO THE BOILING POINT AN INTERVAL OF LO0 NEAR 320 WILL CONTAIN MORE CALORIC THAN TEN DEGI EES NEAR L E AND STILL MORE THAN THE SAME INTERVALS NEAR 212E ON THIS PRINCIPLE WE CAN READILY ACCOUNT FOR THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY MR DALTON IN MIXING WITH WATER AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES A KNOWXN PROWORTION OF ICE  THOUGH IT IS REMARK ABLE THAT THIS ABLE CHEMIST DID NOT SEE IN THEM ANY THING INCONSISTENT WITH HIS OWN OPPOSITE VIEWS UPON SPECIFIC HEAT SC 17605 EXPRESSES THE NUMBER OF DEGREES OF TEMPERATURE

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

CAPABLE OF GIVING THE ABSOLUTE QUANTITIES OF LATENT HEAT IN DIFFERENT VAPOURS AS EXACTLY AS MORE REFINED AND COMPLICATED MECHANISMS AT ANY RATE IT WILL AFFBRD COMPARATIVE RESULTS WITH GREAT PRE CISION IT CONSISTED OF A GLASS RETORT OF VERY SMALL DIMENSIONS WITH A SHORT NECK INSERTED INTO A GLOBULAR RECEIVER OF VERY THIN GLASS AND ABOUT THREE INCHES IN DIAMETER THE GLOBE WAS SURROUNDED WITH A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF WATER AT A KNOWN TEM PERATURE CONTAINED IN A GLASS BASIN 20O GRAINS OF THE LIQUID WHOSE VAPOUR WAS TO BE EXAMINED WERE INTRODUCED ITLTO THE RETORT AND RAPIDLY DISTILLED INTO THE GLOBE BY THE HEAT OF AN ARGAND LAMP THE TEMPERATURE OF THE AIR WAS 45 THAT OF THE WATER IN THE BASIN FROM 42 TO 4 AND THE RISE OF TEM PERATURE OCCASIONED BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE VAPOUR NEVER EXCEEDED THAT OF THE ATMOSPHERE BY 4 DEGREES BY THESE MEANS AS THE COMMUNICATION OF HEAT IS VERY SLOW BETWEEN BODIES WHICH DIFFER LITTLE IN TEMPERATURE I FOUND THAT THE AIR COULD EXERCISE NO PERCEPTIBLE INFLUENCE ON THE WATER IN THE BASIN DURING THE EXPERIMENT WHICH WAS ALWAYS COMPLETED IN 5 OR 6 MINUTES A THERMOMETER OF GREAT DELI CACY WAS CONTINUALLY MOVED THROUGH THE WATER AND ITS

GREATER PRESSURE OR IN A MORE DENSE STATE AND GREATER WHEN IT IS PRODUCED UNDER A LESS PRESSURE OR IN A LESS DENSE STATE BERTHOLLET THINKS THIS FACT SO UNACCOUNTABLE THAT HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO DISCARD IT ALTOGETHER WHETHER THE VIEW WHICH I HAVE JUST OPENED OF THE RELATION SUBSISTING BETWEEN THE ELASTIC FORCE DENSITY AND LATENT HEAT OF DIFFERENT VAPOURS HARMONIZE WITH CHEMICAL PHENOMENA IN GENERAL I LEAVE TO OTHERS TO DETERMINE IT CERTAINLY AGREES WITH THAT UNACCOUNT ABLE FACT WHATEVER BE THE FATE OF THE INVESTIGATION OF THE GENERAL LAW NOW RESPECTFULLY OFFERED THE STATEMENT OF MR WATT MAY BE IMPLICITLY RECEIVED UNDER THE SANCTION OF HIS ACKNOWLEDGED SAGACITY AND CANDOUR CONCLUSION TO THE THEORY OF LATENT HEAT WHICH LIKE THE HYDROSTATIC PARADOX OF ARCHIMEDES MIGHT HAVE REMAINED FOR AGES A BARREN THOUGH BEAUTIFUL PROPOSITION THE FERTILE GENIUS OF THAT PHILOSOPHER GAVE ALL AT ONCE ITS NOBLEST APPLICATION AND MOST BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE ON HUMAN LIFE BY HIS NEW STEAM ENGINE AFTER HIM

FOLLOWING PRACTICAL INFERENCES FROM THE LAST TRAIN OF EX PERIMENTS SINCE THE VAPOUR OF ALCOHOL HAVING THE SAME ELASTIC FORCE AS THE ATMOSPHERE CONTAINS  OF THE LATENT HEAT OF ORDINARY STEAM AND SINCE

j100086,Annals of Mathematics,1967158,Numerical Functions of  x ,i307122,NUMERICAL FUNCTIONS OF x BY E T BELL Theorems on x the greatest positive integer contained in x are broadly of two kinds A Those which reduce sums I fx B Those which express sums z fn as functions of x where in A B x assumes successively each of a given class of values not necessarily integral and n runs through all members of a given set of integers A has been treated in detail by J Hacks following Dirichlet and there are numer ous instances of B due among others to Cesaro Dirichlet Gegenbauer Hermite Liouville Lipschitz and Mertenst The derivation of a result in B is frequently the first step and the application of a theorem in A to this the second in finding arithmetical mean values Independently of these and other wellknown applications theorems in B often have an intrinsic worthfor their elegance if for no other reason We shall consider B and give simple ways of finding such theorems in any desired number The principal results of the paper are expressed in equations 1 to 4 9 11 to 15 18 19 26 27 28 Illustrations of these have been limited to theorems on wellknown elementary func tions A1

Illustrations of  2 for specific Vs When f g are VIs it is always possible to express fg f each as a single i1 in general simpler than fg Tf We shall use such expressions in illustrating  2 for the

direct sums The next appli cation has an independent interest 4 Determinant forms Writing 4 in the form n E na fa  fn aw1 we find on putting successively n  1 2   n and solving the resulting equations

fn similarly deduced from 1 For specific 4ts these give a great many curious identities between determinants of integers e g when the deter minants are substituted for their equivalent 4ts in 4i  4ijk

powers of the first deter minant in 10 are equal similarly all even powers of the second We pass to more general examples which are very rich in special applications 5 Enumerative functions 2 Let c denote a class of positive integers and let Q n  1 or 0 according as n is or is not a member of c also let N0n denote the number of members of c that do not exceed n then Nn  Nn  1  Qpn and iin is the total number of divisors of n that are members of c Writing now Af  n fn  fn 1 we have Af n  fn  f0 whence by 1 n 11 gAf n  E ga  fna f0 a1 which written in full for clearness is cf  1 n n hla  Z

reduction of 12 by 4 gives readily its more useful form n 14 Jn  E  fna  na fa  1 f 0 a1 Of the special cases of these we note from 13 similarly to 9 1 0 0  QCII 2 1 0  Qc2 3 1 1  Qc3 15 Qcn  4 2 1  Qc4 5 2 1  Qcf5 which gives interesting results if c is the class of all primes or the class of all squares etc Or combining 14 in turn with 6 7 and 8 for r  1 we get  Cesaros designation214 E T BELL

we shall derive two general symbolic formulae of wide applicability 6 Two symbolic formula Recalling that urn r we write 17 f Uk Uk9 k hence Uk9  9k Let Xk  X  1k  CiXk1  C2Xk2      Ck k  0 then making the substitutions 17 in 1la we get the first symbolic formula n 18 glk  g  1kn  Enakga k  0 a1 where after expansion g is to be replaced by g viz the left is Clgkln  C2qk2n    Ckgon The second

the same nature but in general for different functions Inverse Sums 7 Reciprocal functions The 41 which satisfies E 1d  0 n  1 is the unit i1 If qiiIj is the unit A1 41s 4Ij are reciprocals of each other When Vi6 is given its reciprocal exists and may easily be foundt 8 Inversions of 1 4 Let hn  0 for n  N N a finite positive integer and consider n 23 Hn  Ehnaga a1 Multiplying 23 by g1n and summing for n  1 2   N 24 E g1nHn  E E hnagagjn  hng9in n1 n1 a1 n1 We now restrict g to be a V and choose g9 the reciprocal of g so that 991 is the unit  7 Hence in this case 24 becomes on transposing N 25 h1  EginHn n1 If now in 1 we replace n by xn and write gfxn Hn fxn hn we get 23 and hence for x  N by 25 XI f x  E 1n f xn n1  The process is an extension of the wellknown method given in Bachmann 1 c pp 310315 t Cf Numerical Functions quoted in footnote 3 We shall assume such reciprocals as we use they are taken from the reference cited or it is easy to verify them a priori216 E T BELL or replacing the arbitrary positive integer x by n we find as the in version of 1 26 fn  Egiagfna a1 We notice that 26 is significant only when g is a At and hence the re ciprocal g9  7 exists The reciprocal of u0 is u defined  3 iii hence writing g u0 in 26 we find as the inversion of 4 n 27 fn  afna a1 which is significant for any f Conversely applying the same process of inversion to 26 27 we get 1 4 viz the terms direct and inverse applied to the sums we are considering are interchangeable If f g are both iks there is clearly in addition to 26 another inversion of 1 n 28 9n  fiagfffna al where fl is the reciprocal  7 of f It is unnecessary to illustrate 27 one example of 26 28 shall suffice Let 0n denote the number of decompositions of n into a pair of relatively prime factors then we have AUU 0 0 and putting f in 1 n n 29 0n  Zuonau2a  nau2 a a1 a1 The reciprocal of 2n is con that of uo is 1 hence 26 28 give as inverses of 29 n n 30 n  Z wa 0na  na 0a a1 a1 n

furnished by a detailed consideration of the reciprocals in  7 cf footnote 9 we have an inexhaustible source of such identities in particular all the results of this same general kind in the

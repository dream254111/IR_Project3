receiving the laundry of the plaintiffs customers The plaintiff appealed contending that the defendant should be restrained from receiving laundry from the plaintiffs customers Held the decision of the trial court should be affirmed New Method Laundry Co v MacCann Calif 1916 I6I Pac 990 An express agreement not to use business secrets which an employee has learned is not necessary in order to grant equitable relief Stevens  Co v Stiles 29 R I 399 71 Atl 802 20 L R A N S 933 MacBethEvans Glass Co v Schnelbach 239 Pa 76 86 Atl 688 The ground of the jurisdiction is to prevent a breach of the trust and confidence necessary between em ployer and employee In Empire Steam Laundry Co v Lozier I65 Cal 95 I30 Pac II80 44 L R A N S 1159 the same court held in a case pre cisely similar that the defendant should be restrained from soliciting or receiving laundry from the plaintiffs customers The decree in this case has been criticized as being too broad See I CAL L REv 385 It is possible that even the decree in the principal case might be said to be too broad There are some well considered cases which hold that an employee may solicit his former employers customers so long as he does so in a fair manner Grand Union Tea Co v Dodds 164 Mich 50 128 N W I090 31 L R A N S 260 Robb v Green 18952 Q B I This doctrine seems just for it puts the employee under no disability to earn a living because of his former employment There are however decisions in which in junctions have been granted quite as sweeping in extent as in the principal case Peoples Coat Apron  Towel Co v Light I57 N Y Supp I5 Stevens  Co v Stiles supra MARRIAGEUNCLE AND NIEcEThe defendant and her uncle were domiciled in the state of Maryland where there was a statute which forbade a marriage between uncle and niece and declared it to be void They went to Rhode Island and were married the marriage being valid there They came back to Maryland and the husband died soon after leaving most of his property to the defendant The plaintiff a nephew of the husband sued to have the marriage declared null and void Held that the marriage being valid in Rhode Island was valid in Marylandat least could not be questioned after the death of one of the parties Fensterwald v Burk Md 1916 98 Atl 358 The general rule is that a marriage valid at the place where performed is valid everywhere Sutton v Warren IO Met Mass 451 Harrison v Harrison 22 Md 468 To this rule it has been held there are two exceptions the first a marriage which is regarded as incestuous or contrary to the laws of God and Christendom the second a marriage which is contrary to a settled state policy and prohibited by statute Pennegar v State of Tennessee 87 Tenn 244 2 L R A 703 It is universally held that a marriage between parties in the lineal descending or ascending line or between brother and sister is incestuous and contrary to the laws of God STORY CONFLICT oF LAWS II3 II4 There is more difference of opinion as to marriages between 446RECENT IMPOIjTANT DECISIONS uncle and niece parties in the third degree of relationship Their marriage is not generally regarded as being incestuous and void on that ground Bowers v Bowers IO Rich Eq S C 551 Weisberg v Weisberg 98 N Y Supp 260 In Weisberg v Weisberg a marriage between an uncle and niece was declared valid the parties having lived together fourteen years There was at that time no statute against such a marriage in New York It is now forbidden in practically every state in the Union PECK DOM REL 2 Al though such a marriage is forbidden and declared void in some states courts of many such states will uphold its validity if it is valid where performed as not being contrary to a settled state policy and affecting good morals Harrison v Harrison supra Schofield v Schofield 51 Pa Super Ct 564 See comment on this case in 6I UNIV oF PA LAW REv 490 Contra Hayes v Rollins 68 N H I9I In the case of United States v Rodgers Io9 Fed 886 a wife who was the niece of her husband naturalized here was refused admission to this country the court holding such a marriage to be shocking to the moral sense and contrary to the policy of Pennsylvania laws The fact that the parties have gone outside of the jurisdiction to marry in order to evade the laws of the state of their domicile has been held to make no differ ence Schofield v Schofield supra POWERSEFFECT OF COVENANT To APPOINTA decedent having an equitable estate for life had power to make such disposition of the estate for the benefit of himself and his children by a last will and testament or by an appointment in the nature of a last will and testament as he may de sire In I905 he made a will in which he appointed 2500000 to the defend ant in pursuance of a covenant that in consideration of 5000oo he would execute such appointment by an irrevocable will Later he made a new will in which the power was executed in a manner inconsistent with the pro visions of the contract Held that the covenantee was not entitled to specific performance and since the appointees received nothing that was the property of the donee there was nothing in their hands that equity could charge with a trust Farmers Loan  Trust Co v Mortimer N Y I9I6 114 N E 389 Equity will not enforce specific performance of a covenant which the donee of a testamentary power makes to the effect that he will appoint in favor of certain objects if he later makes appointments valid otherwise but inconsistent therewith In Re Parkin 1892 3 Ch 5IO In Re Bradshaw 1902 I Ch 342 Wilks v Burns 60 Md 64 But if an appointment is made in accordance with a prior contract the fact that the donee is benefited by preventing a liability for breach arising does not make the appointment bad Coffin v Cooper 2 Dr  Sm 367 Palmer v Locke I5 Ch D 294 The reason underlying the rule is that to grant specific performance would enlarge a testamentary power into a power which could be exercised by deed which would defeat the intention of the donor Reid v Bovshall Io7 N C 345 Where one had an inchoate power to appoint by deed upon reaching a certain age a covenant to appoint made prior to attaining the prescribed age was enforced by equity as a defective execution in Johnson v Touchet 37 L J R 447

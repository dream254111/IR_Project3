VOL XIV NEW YORK OCTOBER 25 I889 NO 351 284 CONTENTS AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIA rION THE seventeenth annual convention of the American Public Health Association was opened Tuesday in the Brooklyn Institute About two hundred members from all parts of this country and Canada were present The first paper was upon The Overshading of Our Homes by Dr William Thornton Parker of Newport RI It was read by Dr C A Lindsley of New Haven In the paper the writer said in part  Overshading is a serious fault and directly lessens the value of real estate and noticeably increases disease and shortens life Houses ostershaded are not healthful no matter how commodious or well built they may be This condition of overshading is very noticeable in our New England and Middle States towns The white faces and sickly appearance of so many of our petple are largely attributable to this cause and suggest that medical men should call attention to the growing evil 7here houses are overshaded the nervous svstem also suffers as well as the general bodily health The discussion brought out clearly that this is a subject on which doctors disagree Dr Lindsley said that it was his belief that the great number of trees in New fIaven was unquestionably the cause of much malaria and other disease in that city Dr Henry P Walcott of Massa chusetts remarked that he had lived in a town as much shaded as New Haven and found no harm from the great number of trees but a direct benefit Dr George M Sternberg USA believed that many malarious places were redeemed by the plantingof trees Dr Gilhon of Washington mentioned the fact that the Roman Campagna had been freed from malaria to a great degree  by the planting of eucalyptus trees The swamps in California were clried in the same way The second palrer upon 4 Clothing in it Relation to Hygiene was by Dr James F Hibberd of Richrnond Ind His conclusions are that many persons dress too warmly and thus induce disease Most persons only regard the amount of clothing to be worn so that it should protect sufficiently against cold and wholly disre gard the effect of overheating and thus disarranging the functions of the skin Dr Hibberd maintained that an insufficiently clothed person was not the one who caught cold but it was the overclad one who was most subject to it He summed up as follows  It seems time that the relation of clothing to tlle health of the people of temperate climates engaged in civil industries should be reviewed and the points for investiga tion may be summarized thus viz I The popular and profes sional estimate of the hsgiene of the skin is much below its real im portance 2 The physiology of the skin cannot be largely inter fered with without endangergng the general healtll 3 One of the influential factors in the sound health of man is to establish and maintain in his organization a resisting power to the causes of dis ease 4 The tendency is to overdress enervating the skin and curtailing its power and thereby the power of the whole system to resist the causes of disease 5 A proper exposure of the surface of the body to environing low temperature is a valuable general tonic 6 Ventilation of the skin is indispensable to good health 7 Habit may enable one to bear wide differences in clothing un der similar surroundings without detriment and this should im press the necessity of cultivating correct habits of dress A paper on  Causes and Prevention of Infant Mortality was presented by Dr Jerome Walker of Brooklyn Dr Walker finds from statistics that the common belief was not sustained that infant mortality in this country had decreased of late years The hope of the future lies in a radical change so that mere political doctors may not control the health boards and in the sanitary education of the masses The speaker said  We may conclude from what is known of institutions for children I that a large proportion of the deaths in them are preventable 2 that the younger the chil dren and the larger the number the greater the mortality 3 that the mortality can be lessened but the decrease costs money time patience and energy and to obtain the best results the attending and resident physicians should be reliable should be given control over all medical and sanitary matters and should be held responsi ble for the same In the next paper on  The vRelations of the Dwellings of the Poor to Infant Mortality by Alfred F White CE of Brooklyn were quoted statistics to show that such institutions as the Pea body Association of London were needed here Through the re forms thus instituted in tenementhouse construction the infant mortality of London had been reducedto Iseper cent of all deaths while in this city it was 26 per cent Dr George Homan of St Louis secretary of the Missouri State Board of Health read a paper advocating the employment of better men as local healthofficers at higher pay In the evening the delegates and their friends went to the Academy of Music Dr J lIRaymond opened the exercises with a short address of welcome Mayor Chapin welcomed the dele gates on behalf of the city and Dr Hutchins performed a similar office for the medical profession Then came the address of Presi dent Johnson His purpose he said was to talk to the people not to scientists He said 4 A death from typhoidfever now means not so much a dispen sation of Providence as it means foul water foul food or foul air A city is decimated by a pestilence and it is found that its founda tions are honeycombed with cesspools and its drinkingwater is diluted sewage The judgments of God in the light of these revelations become no more mysterious than the pains of the child that laughingly thrusts its tiny finger into the brilliant flame only VOL XIV No 35 I to feel the terrible

election The good features of lie old charter which was adopted in 1889 were retained but the i fficulties in the way of the practical administration of the city govern miient made it necessary or at least desirable to have a new charter rFie city was fortunate in that it did not have to resort to the legislature to secure a new charter for all that was necessary was to elect thirteen fr eholders for this purpose After devoting three months of continuous labtor the board of freeholders submitted the present charter which was adopted by a vote of the people414 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The new charter is a substantial reconstruction of the old charter along modern progressive lines giving greater power to the city in general and especially in some important particulars In submitting the charter the board of freeholders characterized it as providing for the transaction of public business with the same promptness efficiency and common sense that a citizen would use in conducting his own private business If this has been accomplished progress has been made t1 he new charter confers greater power on the city for the preservation and protection of health and property The city is given power to con struct and maintain dikes and levees for the prevention of floods and to acquire maintain and operate tunnels tracks depots telephone and telegraph lines bridges and subways Broader powers of condemna tion for public purposes are also given The common council is given greater powers among them the power to regulate control or prohibit sign boards bill boards and structures for advertising purDoses Another very important power conferred is that to regulate the rates to be charged for services of public utilities The city is also given the power to establish and maintain plants for paving repaving and repairing streets and to bid in competition with contractors for such work The power of the council to subject occupa tions corporations institutions etc to license tax and regulation has been enlarged The power of the mayor is also increased by making him a member eX officio of all boards He is also made directly responsible for the management and operation of the fire water and health departments by placing in his hands the power to appoint without confirmation of the council the members of these boards The reason given for this is that the right of confirmation originally given the council was intended as a check upon bad appointments by the mayor but that this right has been converted into an actual participation by the council in the appoint ing power A purchasing agent is provided for in the new charter He is given power under certain restrictions to purchase materials and supplies for the several departments it being the opinion of the framers that this will result in great economy A municipal court is created to take the place of the police court and the mayors court It will have jurisdiction over grading and condemna tion cases in addition to the functions discharged by the police court under the old charter It has been estimated that threefourths of the grading cases can be disposed of in the municipal court without appealNOTES ON CURRENT LEGISLATION 415 thereby resulting in a large annual saving to the city in court and legal expenses The judge of the court must be an attorney of at least five years experience at the bar Provision is made in the charter that no franchise can be granted for a longer period than thirty years without submitting it to a vote of the people There is also included a provision to the effect that a public ut ilities commission can be created by ordinance with powei to investi gate all facts and matters relating to the rates charged by public service corporations and the character of the service rendered The city has authority to require and enforce the production of books and papers and to compel the attendance of witnesses for the purpose of ascertaining the facts under investigation The health board is given greater power and a somewhat novel feature is introduced No member of the board can be a practising physician and the members are to serve without compensation The board is given authority to appoint a medical staff which also will serve without compensation This staff it seems will act in an advisory capacity being designated as a visiting and consulting staff The board will choose the health commissioner and other officers and is given power to abate all nuisances in addition to the general control over the inspection of meat and milk the enforcement of pure food laws regulations con cerning contagious or infectious diseases etc The board is given power to act immediately and effectively in case of great emergencies which affect or endanger the public health The framers considered the sub ject of health one of the most important coming before them and thought that all authority regarding sanitary measures should be centered in this i oard and that it should be held directly responsible for their enforcement Of the new features in the charter the most important are the pro visions creating a civil service commission and providing for the referen Itirm in certain cases The board of freeholders state that the refer endum is a method of securing the highest degree of selfgovernment No franchise ordinance can become effective within sixty days and if dur ing this period a petition is signed by twenty per cent of the qualified voters the ordinance must be submitted to the people for adoption or rejection The council can submit any franchise ordinance to the people Without a petition but no franchise can be granted for more than thirty years without submission to a vote of the people The provision in regard to civil service seems to be very full and com plete an effort being made to devise a system which will be practical fair and efficient416 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The voters were given an opportunity to vote on an alternative propositionthe recall The board of freeholders were unwilling to jeopardize the entire charter by incorporating the recall but considered it of sufficient importance to justify its submission as a separate proposition It may be mentioned that all boards are made uniform in number and qualifications each board to consist of three members only

j100009,The American Economic Review,1803406,The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer,i331294,THE TARIFF AND THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER1 The purpose of this article is to emphasize the fact that both in the theoretical discussion of the tariff question and in the prac tical determination of tariff rates an important element of the problem has too frequently been omitted I refer to the great difference between producers prices and consumers prices and to the relation which exists between the two The discussion of the relation of the tariff to prices is generally conducted on the as sumption that there is a given single price for an article in one country at any given time rather than with reference to the impor tant commercial fact that there are different prices for the same article at different stages of distribution Of course this very sim ple fact has never been entirely forgotten but it has been too frequently assumed that producers prices and consumers prices somehow move together automatically and that a change in the one will always be reflected in the other In the Middle Ages the attempt was made to bring about such an adjustment of prices by positive statute The characteristic of the Assizes of Bread and Ale was the provision determining the size of the farthing loaf according to each slight fluctuation in the price of wheat In the same way the price of ale was regulated according to the price of the raw material In modem economic writing the all too easy assumption has usually been made that a similar adjustment be tween producers prices and consumers prices is secured by means of competition In the case of a large proportion of goods bought for immediate consumption such an adjustment often does not appear at all even over considerable periods of time In fact price conditions frequently change altogether before the longtime forces which might ultimately bring such adjustment have had time to operate This makes much of our theoretical reasoning regarding prices entirely useless for the actual problems of com merce and even suggests the necessity of a radical revision of our price theories Price phenomena which the economist has been in the custom of waiving aside as abnormal or temporary are really every day occurrences in the business world and are persis tent and ordinary rather than unusual The exceptions to the supposed general rule are so common that one may well ask I This article was prepared before the appearance of Professor Taussigs Some Aspects of the Tariff Question A brief note is appended at the close of the article indicating its relation to this admirable new work1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 535 whether both for the purposes of economic theory and for the problems of economic legislation the ordinarily accepted theory as to competitive prices is not more a hindrance than a help It would be possible to give illustrations from a great number of the articles bought for daily use by the average man and wo man The price of a loaf of bread does not fluctuate directly with the price of wheat nor the price of a glass of beer with the price of barley There are very many articles of daily use the prices of which are fixed and customary and therefore will not be raised or lowered according to changes in either the supply or price of the raw material True the producer under conditions of coin petition must adjust his price to the conditions of supply But the producer does not sell directly to the consumer His price may show most extraordinary changes over a period of years while the consumer pays the same price throughout A typical illustra tion is that of the herring or sardine industry on the coast of Maine The price to the consumer is uniformly 5 cents per can which is the equivalent of 5 per case in the producers hands The producer however gets anywhere from 230 per case to 375 per case according to the conditions of the season The difference of 25 cents a case may be a matter of material profit or loss on the part of the packer According to the ordinary theory of compe tition he should be selling his goods under conditions to assure him a normal profit in the long run As a matter of fact he may make a killing or may go broke But what happens to the producer seems to have no effect upon the consumer Whether the packer sells below cost or sells at a price which gives him a hand some profit on his seasons operations the consumer still pays his customary 5 cents This instead of being an exceptional industry is quite typical of a large part of business at the present time under our system of distribution with its rigid customary or set prices The price paid by the consumer and the price received by the pro ducer seem to have very little direct relation To make clear in greater detail the surprising complexity of the situation let me take a few illustrations from the report of the Tariff Board on the cotton industry regarding the price of cotton bedquilts Through out this article the writer confines himself to illustrations from industries covered by the reports of the Tariff Board because he served as a member of that body during the three years of its ex istence 19091912 Many sirnilar illustrations could be given from a wider range of industries536 Henry C Emery September In 1907 the manufacturers price for a certain cheap cotton bedquilt was 65 cents The jobber sold this quilt to the retailer for 75 cents and the retailer sold it to the consumer for 1 In the following year this same quilt was sold by the manufacturer because of difference in the price of raw material for 212 cents less The jobbers price was correspondingly reduced by 212 cents but the retailers price to the consumer was still 1 In 1911 this same quilt was sold by the manufacturer for 75 cents an increase of 10 cents over the price of 1907 The jobber now added 25 cents instead of 10 cents to the price and sold to the retailer at 1 and the retailer sold to the consumer at 150 Thus an increase of 10 cents in the price at the mill became an increase of 50 cents to the purchaser The actual profit to the manufacturer was about 6 cents per quilt A somewhat similar quilt was sold in 1907 by the manufacturer for 712 cents by the jobber at 1 and by the retailer at 150 In 1911 this same quilt was sold by the manufacturer at 67 cents by the j obber at 75 cents and by the retailer at 1 Thus a decrease in price at the mill of 4 cents resulted in a reduc tion of price to the consumer of 50 cents A superior kind of quilt was sold ten years ago at 80 cents at the mill by the jobber to the retailer for 1 and by the retailer to the consumer at 150 In 1911 this same quilt was sold at the mill for 117 by the jobber for 150 and by the retailer for 250 Thus an increase at the mill of 37 cents resulted in a change of only 50 cents in the jobbers price but raised the price to the consumer by a full dollar On the other hand a fine socalled satin quilt was sold in 1907 at the mill for 325 and to the consumer in some cases at least for 5 The following year it was sold at the mill for 3 and to the consumer for 5 In the above examples the relation of the price which the pro ducer receives for his commodity to the price which the consumer pays for it seeins to follow no rule of logic We have seen that in one case an increase of 10 cents at the mill was followed by an increase of 50 cents to the consumer and in another case that a de crease of 4 cents at the mill was followed by a decrease of 50 cents to the consumer and in a third case that a decrease of 25 cents at the mill made no difference at all in the price to the consumer I have emphasized the problem of the relation of prodducer to consumer because the whole argument regarding the tariff question1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 537 hinges upon this relationship The contest between protectionists and freetraders has been generally looked upon as a struggle be tween producers and consumers The argument for protection has always been that the government should restrict the importation of foreign commodities manufactured at a cost lower than that for similar coininodities produced at home to enable the home pro ducer to compete on favorable terms in his own market The argu ment for free trade has been that such protection has always been at the cost of the consumer who has been obliged to pay the higher prices and that from the moral point of view this was unfair class legislation in that it taxed the many for the benefit of the few while from the economic point of view it was unwise in that it forced the investment of labor and capital fronm more profitable to less profitable lines of enterprise This argument is clear and familiar It is based on the assump tion that each individual if left entirely undisturbed by govern mnent regulation will naturally seek that employment for his capi tal which is most profitable Where each capitalist invests in those industries which are most profitable under the given natural con ditions of the community in which he lives it may naturally be assumed that the wealth of the whole community will be most rapidly increased The very fact that a protective tariff is needed in order to maintain an industry in existence in a given community shows that that industry is less adapted to the character of the natural resources or the character of the producing population than an industry which can support itself without extraneous aid Protection therefore is supposed to be either useless or harmful It is useless where the home producer can put his goods on the market more cheaply than the foreign producer it is harmful where the goods can be imported more cheaply from some other country since it induces investment in less profitable lines In the face of the seemingly inevitable logic of this argument the protectionists have been hard put to it to find any intellectual jus tification of their faith Some of their arguments have been pro found and have taken account of factors of importance which free traders have ordinarily overlooked Other arguments have been extremely shallow and many of the protectionist arguments have been in conflict with one another It is no part of the purpose of this paper to discuss these arguments except to consider the one question of the relation of tariff to price It is well however to re member that when such a problem as that of the tariff becomes a538 Henry C Emery September problem of practical politics the necessity of appealinig to different classes of people for their support is almost certain to result in an array of inconsistencies The freetraders are by no mlieans guilt less in this regard For example an interesting illustration is to be found in the attitude of the English freetraders toward the Cana dian preferential tariff According to the free trade theory a tariff reduction should always prove beneficial both to the exportiilg and the importing country and should lead to an expansion of trade whichl has been foolishly and artificially restricted Mr Chamberlain however had advocated preferential tariffs as between the mother country and the colonies as a practical political pro gram Canada had taken the lead in giving preference to English goods by reducing her tariff first by 25 per cent and then by 33 13 per cent on imports from the mother country This fronm the free trade point of view should have been welcomed as at least a step in advance but it now became desirable from the exigencies of party politics in England to show that there was no advantage in the Chamberlain policy and the freetraders exerted themselves in every way to prove that despite this reduction in favor of English goods English trade had not expanded as compared with American trade paying a higher tariff and that consequently preferences of this kind had proved themselves of no advantage The obvious retort is If this was true why advocate reductioni at all It is hardly necessary to point out that the most comnmon and obvious inconsistency on the part of the freetraders lies in their miiaintaining in controversial arguments at one and the same time that protection is not needed in order to maintain a given industry and that the result of protecting such an industry is to divert labor and capital into less profitable undertakings One charge may be true of onie industry and the other of another They can not both be true of the same industry at the same time The great inconsistency however in the minds of most people has been that of the protectionist party in this country which after advocating the necessity of protection because of the inability of the producer to meet the competition of foreign cheap goods was obliged to face the ire of the consumer who said that he wanted his goods as cheap as possible and preferred to buy them fromyi the foreign manufacturer rather than pay tribute to the domestic manufacturer Consequently the protectionists felt forced to reply that under a system of protection domestic goods could be1915 T1he Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 539 purchased as cheaply as foreign goods unlder a system of free trade It was conteinded in the first place that the growth of domestic industry would ultimately lead to such comipetition that the home price would be reduced to the level of the foreign price But this of course was not an adequate defense of a permanent systemn of protection The obvious reply was that if the inanufac turer had come to the point where he could sell as cheaply as the foreigner he would not be injured by a reduction of the tariff This in turn was not at all satisfactory to the advocate of protection wlho wished to miaintain it not only as a permanent policy in gen eral but who wished to maintain rates after they were obviously unnecessary from the point of view of tlle relative cost of pro duction here and abroad Consequently there arose the famous argument that the foreigner pays the tax With this argument it was hoped to satisfy everybody There was an instinctive feeling that protectionism involved a loss some where If it could be shown that this loss fell upon the foreign producer and that the domestic producer gained while the domestic consumer lost nothing an argument for permanent protection seemed to be established But the inconsistency would not down in the minds of intelligent people The protectionist must say one or the other thing Either the tariff raises prices or it does not raise prices that is either it maintains domestic prices at a higher level than foreign prices or it does not do so If domestic prices are no higher than foreign prices what is the need of protection Obviously the protectionist has little standing ground left On the other hand if protection does maintain a higher level of prices for the benefit of the producer how can he escape the inevitable conclusion that the consumer pays the price that the benefit to one domestic class is paid out of the pockets of another It is just here that the propositions advanced above become vital I mean the fact that when we talk about the price of an article in our theoretical reasoning regarding the tariff we are inclined to talk very glibly as if there were but one price for an article at a given time The fact is there are various prices Not only are different producers selling the same article at differ ent prices but the same producer frequently sells different por tions of an identical product at different prices in different markets Indeed strange as it may seem he may sell the identical product at different prices in the same market I have known cases where manufacturers have sold an article of exactly the same quality540 Henry C Emery September under the name of two different grades selling the lowerpriced product when the demand for the higherpriced and supposedly better grade had become exhausted It is of course a very com mon practice for producers to sell at different prices in different markets and it is a mistake to suppose that it takes either a high tariff or a condition of monopoly to make such a price policy profitable It is no longer to be looked upon as something unusual and to be explained as occurring only under peculiar noncompeti tive conditions It comes nearer to being typical of market phe nomena in general than is the competitive determination of prices on a board of trade or cotton exchange In other words the prin ciple of charging what the traffic will bear is now a common rule of trade We are however not so much concerned with such diver gences of price as with the much simpler fact that at any given time for any standard article there is a producers price a job bers price and a retailers price To my mind much of the writing of economists on the theory of international trade is weakened if not vitiated by their failure to consider these actual facts of business life They take hypo thetical illustrationsthe price of wheat in Poland and the price of linen in Irelandand draw conclusions as to the general effects of tariff as if these prices were single and uniform Detailed tariff investigations make one somewhat skeptical of the theoretical rea soning on both sides of the question When we come to con sider the actual effect of any particular tariff rate we find that frequenLly for quite unexpected and sometimes inexplicable rea sons a similar tariff seems to operate in very divergent wavs in different cases The problem is far less simple than it appears on its face What was said about bedquilts applied only to domestic goods and had no particular connection with the tariff question It is now obvious what the tariff application would be Just as a reduction of 25 cents in the mill price may have no effect on the consumer s price so it is quite possible that a reduction of a tariff by 25 cents even if it forced the producer to sell by that much less would have no effect upon the consumer On the other hand just as an increase of 10 cents in the mill price led to an increase of 50 cents o the consumer so it is quite possible that an increase of the tariff by the amount of 10 cents might increase the consumers price by 50 cents The point of theoretical interest lies herethat if aniy sound1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 541 economic argument for the permanent maintenance of a certain scale of protective duties can be made the germ of it will be found I believe in this consideration of the relation of producer to con sumer Indeed it may be that after a consideration of facts of this nature we shall have to admit that what seemed hopeless in consistency in the protectionists position is not so hopeless after all We left him on the horns of the dilemma raised by the ques tion Does the tariff raise prices or does it not raise prices If he replied in the affirmative he was met by protests from the con sumer If he replied in the negative he was met with derision by the freetrader since there would be no object in a protective tariff if it does not protect Is it not possible to reply now that con ceivably a protective tariff can be so arranged as to raise the pro ducers price while not increasing the consumers price Through our peculiar method of distribution of which more will be said later there is a wide margin between the price which the maker of an article gets and the price which the user of an article pays The protectionist might assert that his object was merely to reduce this margin to secure to the producer a somewhat higher price than he would be able to get without the tariff but to take this increase out of the margin between producer and consumer without laying any additional burden upon the latter If as above sug gested the tariff question represents an issue between producers and consumers here might seem to be the possibility of a greater harmony After all the chief demand on the part of the public for tariff reduction in this country has been not from theoreti cal consideration nor from the widespread belief that capital has been diverted into unprofitable undertakings but simply from the general conviction that the tariff has increased the cost of living to the ultimate consumer Now this ultimate consumer is simply con cerned with one particular price namely the price which he has to pay He is not concerned with mill prices or j obbers prices but merely with retail prices On the other hand the producers in their advocacy of the tariff are not concerned with the price paid by the consumer They would be glad to have the consumer get his goods as cheaply as possible provided the mill price of goods is enough to yield them the desired margin of profit Take for instance such a case as the cotton industry It should be remembered that the difference of half a cent a yard on many fabrics means all the difference between profit and loss to the manufacturer whereas on the other hand that difference of542 Henry C Emery September half a cent a yard at the miill may have no effect on the consumer On the basis of these facts a theoretical argumient miay be made in favor of protection to this effect that a moderate amount of protection would enable many large established industries to main tain more active and profitable business and a greater continuity of enmployment and yet not throw any proportional burden upon the consumer This proposition can be illustrated by actual cases in detail There can be no question that the retail prices of cotton goods in this country are higher than in England and most people have at tributed this to the fact that the tariff enables the manufacturer to charge a higher price The report of the Tariff Board on this industry was somewhat of a revelation even to the manufacturers themnselves regarding relative producers prices in this country and in England In the list of 100 samples of cotton goods running all the way from cheap cotton duck to fine tapestries it was found that in 37 cases the American manufacturer was selling at a lower price than the English manufacturer Twentyfive of the 100 samples were printed cloths including challies lawns percales organdies ba tistes and so forth Of these 25 samples it was found that 10 were selling lower at the mills in the United States than in Eng land 13 were selling at higher prices in the United States and for 2 English prices could not be obtained On the other hand in all these cases the American consumer was paying more and often much more than the English consumer Obviously in the cases of those goods selling as cheaply at the mill in this coun try as abroad these higher prices to the consumer could not be the result of the tariff Under conditions of perfect free trade the jobber would still have been able to get his goods cheaper from the American manufacturer than from the English manufacturer There would have been no occasion for importations The higher prices to consumners are to be explained by our method of distribu tion and the much wider margin between manufacturer and jobber jobber and retailer and retailer and consumer in this country than abroad One of the most effective causes of this situation is to be found in the existence of socalled set prices in the trade that is there are for ordinary cotton goods certain customary or fixed prices which admit of no intermediate prices If the retailer can not sell at the customary price he does not increase his price by 21915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 543 cent or 1 cent a yard but jumps the fabric into the next classifi cation These classes are 10 cents 1212 cents 15 cents 19 cents 25 cents 35 cents with sometimes an intermediate rate of 29 cents A few illustrations will show what I mean A standard printed percale sold at the American mill for 634 cents a yard representing a profit of less than 34 of a cent to the producer It reached the consumer at 10 cents a yard The same cloth was sold by the English mill at more than 2 cent a yard higher than the American price but reached the consumer at the same figure A staple India linon was sold at the American mill for 71S cents giving a profit iof 114 cents per yard It was jobbed at 912 cents and retailed to the consumer at either 1212 cenits or 15 cents ac cording to the locality This same cloth cost 12 cent more at the English mill than at the American mill but reached the consumer at about 11 cents that is with a higher price for the English producer the English consumer got the article anywhere from 13 to nearly 4 cents less than the price charged the American consumer A printed curtain scrim was sold by the American mills at 1012 cents a yard was jobbed to the retailer at 1212 cents and sold by the retailer at 19 cents 25 cents and sometimes even at 29 cents a yard according to local conditions The same cloth was sold at the English mill for slightly over 10 cents a yard and reacllel the consumer at 1514 cents that is althouglh the American mill price exceeded the English mill price by only 3 of a cent the retail price in this country was from 4 to 14 cents higher than in England A particularly interesting case was a standard mercerized pop lin This sold at the American mill at 1412 cents and reached the consumer at 25 cents In England it sold at the mill for about 2 cents a yard less than at the American mill but was retailed for 1714 cents Another illustration is that of a typical sample of fancy white goods sold to the betterclass trade at the retail price of eitlher i5 cents or 39 cents in this country and at about 22 cents a yard in England This sold at the American mill for 1812 cents and at the English mill for 151X4 cents Here a difference of 314 cents in mill price was accompanied by a difference of from 13 to nearly 17 cents in the retail price It is worth while to give such detailed figures as these to bring544 Henry C Emery September out the fact that there is no single rule governing the effect on the consumer of particular tariff increases or decreases even in the case of goods of similar quality We used to occupy ourselves in the Tariff Board office sometimes when time permitted in figuring out just what changes would affect prices and what changes would not I remember making a calculation on one fabric where we started with an assumed 10 per cent reduction on an article selling for 25 cents This showed that under the methods of distribution in the cotton goods trade the consumer would receive no benefit The same was true of a 20 per cent reduction a 30 per cent reduc tion and a 40 per cent reduction On the other hand we figured that a reduction of 50 per cent would reduce the price just enough to enable the retailer to throw the article into the lower classifica tion and sell it at 19 cents In other words a reduction of 40 per cent would apparently have been of no benefit to the consumer whereas a reduction of 50 per cent would have saved him 6 cents a yard Take for example the last two cases cited from the samples of cotton goods In the case of the standard mercerized poplin selling at 25 cents to the consumer if the duty had been entirely removed and the American mill price reduced to 1212 cents to correspond to the English mill price it would still have been jobbed at 162 cents and would have retailed at the old price of 25 cents giving the consumer no benefit at all For this article to get to the American consumer at the price paid by the English consumer the mill price would have needed to be reduced to 1012 cents or 2 cents lower than the mill price in England On the other hand in the case of the fancy white goods the American cost was about ll2 cents giving a mill profit of 7 or 8 cents a yard A reduction in duty which would have brought the American mill price down to the level of the English mill price would still have allowed a profit of 334 cents a yard to the manu facturer and would have resulted in a saving of at least 10 cents a yard to the American cbnsumer A somewhat different problem arises in the case of the woolen and worsted industry where not only are consumers prices of the products higher than abroad but in the great majority of cases producers prices as well Here it may fairly be assumed that the prices of manufactures of wool have been increased to the ultimate consumer by means of the tariff Whether this has been a wise or an unwise policy as a whole is not a part of the present discussion1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 545 It is worth while however to say that in such a case one can very easily draw erroneous conclusions regarding the effect on the con sumer of any particular reduction of the tariff As in the case of the cotton fabrics referred to above where it was shown that a reduction of 40 per cent might lead to no reduction in the consum ers price while a reduction of 50 per cent might be a large saving to the consumer so in the case of wool manufacturers it should be recognized that it is all a matter of degree and that it is quite possible that a seemingly large reduction though reducing the mill price of the iianufacturer might not result in a corresponding gain to the consumer In the case of raw wool we had a situation under the earlier tariff where about one third of our total consumption was im ported The protectionist legislators themselves in arranging the duties on manufactures of wool went on the assumption that the price of wool would be raised by the full duty Of course the actual importer of wool did pay the whole duty but it would be difficult to determine how far London prices were cut for his benefit to enable him to bring the wool in over the tariff barrier It seems to be the general opinion of wool dealers both in England and in this country that in general the price of similar domestic wool was raised by about half the amount of the tariff and that at certain times the addition to the price of wool in this country because of the tariff was even less It was a common statement in the trade four years ago that wool was already selling on a free trade basis Such a condition was however exceptional and we may fairly as sume that the former duty on wool materially raised the price of the article to the purchaser On the other hand it would be going too far to say that the price of domestic wools in the grease was normally higher than for similar grades in London by the full 11 cents per pound This scliedule offers one of the most interesting illustrations of the cumulative effects of a tariff Not only did the producer have to pay for his raw material but so far as the worsted indus try was concerned nearly all of the machinery up to the process of weaving was imported This machinery paid a duty of 45 per cent and that together with extra charges forced the American manufacturers to start with a higher investment in machinery by something like 65 or 70 per cent The duties on the manufactures of wool due to the allowance made for the duty on raw wool were in many cases absurdly high But even with all these conditions546 Henry C Emery September the prices of woolen goods in this country were not raised by any thing like the full amount of the duty The Tariff Board made a calculation on 16 typical cloths of low and medium grade on which the average rate of duty was 183 per cent while the price on these goods as compared with similar goods in the English market was about 67 per cent higher This particular calculation has become somewhat prominent in the discussion of this problem by econo mists but the average figure 67 per cent should of course be taken with due caution The extent to which the American price and the English price of similar fabrics diverge is extremely various and frequently the divergences are difficult to understand In the case of a number of suitings the American price is about 45 or 50 per cent more than the English while in other cases the diver gence runs well above 67 per cent To illustrate the point I desire to bring out in this paper it is only necessary to take some one specific difference Further calculations can be made at will as to the probable effect of reductions in tariff rates on the basis of oLbier differences which may be assumed The question may then be asked what will be the effect of the actual change made in the duties on woolen and worsted goods upon the price paid for clothing by the ultimate consumer Of course people who are accustomed to go to England for their clothes will feel an immediate relief The present duty on clothing is 35 per cent whereas formerly in bringing our custommade suits into the country we paid 75 to 90 per cent and sometimes even more To such people the saving is direct and obviouis The great mass of people however do not go to London for their clothes and do not even go to tailors for them They buy readymade suits from the retailer Here comes in that factor of the great gap between producers prices and the consumers prices which is likely to absorb any benefit which the reluction in the tar iff wouild otherwise bring Of course if foreign countries should develop a great readymade clothing industry to meet the demands of the American market the consumer would realize a great benefit It is not impossible that this will prove to be the case but I am very skeptical regarding it As yet at least there is no sign of the foreign producer being able to meet the tastes of the American public or to develop the readymade clothing industry which is after all a distinctively American enterprise In this case the question arises whether the consumer of ready made clothing in this country will gain muich if anything from a1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 547 reduction of duty on the material Retail trade is determined very largely by custom Prices are fixed at certain customary points There are 1250 suits 18 suits 23 suits 35 suits and so on Here again the problem of price changes is largely a question of detail rather than of general theory I shall venture some further very specific figures to illustrate the point Besides investigating costs and prices in the matter of wool and the manufacture of cloth the Tariff Board made a study of the readymade clothing industry and the relation of the prices of clothing to the tariff Among other things they took a number of actual typical suits and traced the prices and costs from the price of the suit on the consumers back to the cost of the wool on the back of the sheep Let uis examine a typical case The old tariff was 11 cents a pound on wool and on cloth was 44 cents a pound plus 55 per cent The new act provides for free wool and a rate of 35 per cent upon cloth How should these changes affect the consumer The first example given by the Tariff Board is that of a fancy worsted suit for which the consumer pays 23 or more To make this suit it took 97 pounds of half blood Ohio wool for which the wool grower received 223 Even if we assume that this price of Ohio wool included the full amount of the former duty and that the consumer would get the full benefit of any reduction it will be seen that the saving on a 23 suit would be only 106 on account of the removal of the tariff on wool If on the other hand the price of domestic wool was not nor mally raised by the full amount of the old 11cent rate but by say 512 cents the reduction in the cost of the raw material on such a suit would be only 53 cents Whether so small a reduction would redound to the benefit of the consumer or be absorbed in the process of distribution is of course something that could be finally determined only by experience It is not by any means to be assumed that the consumer would get his suit 50 cents cheaper On the other hand if the consumers price were reduced at all it would probably be reduced by more than the 50 cents because of the fact that the suit would be thrown intoa lowerpriced class More directly illustrative of the point under consideration is the question of the effect of the change in duty on cloth The analysis by the Tariff Board further shows that this 97 pounds of wool was turned into 36 yards of cloth of which the cost of manufacture was 442 cents per yard Adding to this the cost of548 Henry C Emery September the wool 823 cents per yard the total cost of the cloth was 1265 per yard and the selling price to the clothing manufacturer was 1328 giving a margin of profit to the cloth manufacturer of about 6 cents per yard or 23 cents on a suit costing the consumer 23 The total cost of making a suit was 1432 of which 755 was for cloth linings and trimmings and 190 for selling ex pense The regular wholesale price of the suit was 1650 the net price after deducting discount 1539 This was the price paid by the retailer who then sold the suit to the consumer for 23 Consider now the effect of a change in the tiariff on woolen cloth The total cost of the cloth in this suit was 478 From other figures given above assume this to be higher than similar cloth purchased in England by 67 per cent Then the English price would be 286 for the 36 yards Under the Underwood rates the duty on such cloth would be 35 per cent or 1 which would bring the price duty paid on the 36 yards of cloth to 386 instead of 478 or a saving of only 91 cents on the suit It may be noted that in the case of this particular fabric it was found that a very similar article was being sold in England at about 23 of the American price In such a case the saving on a suit would be only about 48 cents instead of 91 cents On the other hand of course in the case of some suitings the amount would be greater rather than less Here again the question arises as to how far this saving on the cost of cloth to wit less than 5 per cent on the price of the suit would be reflected in the actual price paid by the consumer As already stated suits sell at cer tain fixed customary prices and the manufacturer does not make a reduction of a few cents every time he is able to buy his cloth stock at a slight reduction Still less does the retailer The mere fact that the clothing manufacturer could get his stock somewhat cheaper from the English cloth manufacturer than from the Ameri can does not necessarily mean that the price to the consumer would be reduced As already suggested above if any reduction were made it would probably be greater than indicated by the actual saving in duties due to the fact that the suit would now be thrown into a lower retail class Such questions are questions which in one sense can be finally determined only by the test of experience On the other hand any one thoroughly conversant with the range of mill prices jobbers prices and retail prices over a period of years can probably predict the change with a fair degree of1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 549 accuracy The difficulty would be great only where the price fell near the margin between two classes It may perhaps be better without drawing any definite conclu sions to leave to the reader the above detailed examples of the complexity involved in the problem of the effect of tariff duties on prices when we put aside general theorizing on the incidence of taxation and attempt to determine the actual result of any par ticular rate on any particular commodity under actually existing conditions Indeed the object of this paper is to state the prob lenm and emphasize its complexity rather than to solve it It aims to show that a solution of practical value can not be secured by reasoning from a set of imaginary conditions but only from a study of infinite detail This is not meant to minimize the impor tance of sound theoretical reasoning in the field of economics only to insist that the application of such reasoning to practical legis lation in tariff matters should not be made too cavalierly or with disregard of the facts of our distributive system which are some tinmes as inexplicable as they are stubborn Brief reference mnust be made to two obvious objections that may be raised It may be said that however many peculiar cases may be cited the whole system of protective tariffs must generally tend to maintain a higher level of producers prices in the pro tected country and that in the long run these must tend toward hiiglher consumers prices Nothing in the above article is meant to controvert this view although there may be cases where pro tection by stimulating the development of new resources may work toward lower prices of raw material The point is of primary im portance if we wish to consider the theoretical question of free trade versus protection or to discuss the comparative results whicli would arise from the choice of one policy or the other on the part of some imaginary country without a past history in this re gard The present article is intended however as a contribution to the intensely pracLical question of the probable effect of actual tariff changes in this country In the first place we have our exist ing systems of manufacturing and distributing as they arethe products of more than a century of past policies In the second place no political party proposes a change to actual free trade The present Democratic tariff like those of the past is a protective tariff True it may be levied with no ulterior intentions other thani raising revenue So long however as it levies duties on thousands of articles which compete with domestic products it has just as550 Henry C Emery September important effects one way or the other on the interests of both producer and consulmer as any Republican measure Mr Under woods theory of a competitive tariff seems identical in principle with Mr Tafts theory of a tariff to equalize costs of produc tion The difference is one of degree As a Democratic member of the Tariff Board used to say It is all a question of the amount of freeboard The deck may be left free which in smooth waters would make no difference It may be protected to any degree desired against the possible waves of foreign competition There fore since the practical problem is not whether we have free trade or protection but whether we shall reduce the duty on clothing to 35 per cent or to 25 per cent ad valorem the considerations offered above are of great practical importance The former rate might conceivably not change consumers prices at all the latter might bring about a substantial fall The higher rate might force manu facturers out of business as effectively as the lower rate but without the compensatory gain to the consumer Surely these are questions worth the attention of tariff students whether economists or congressmen The second objection that might be urged is that to advocate the framing of tariff legislation with reference to the considerations here suggested is merely a counsel of perfection It may be claimed that the complexities are so great and conditions change so rapidly that it is impossible to secure a sufficiently accurate knowledge to be of practical use I may confess that when first undertaking the work assigned to the Tariff Board I was some what skeptical in this regard myself Through experience how ever I became thoroughly convinced that within a reasonable time such information could be secured which if not complete would be at least adequate for the purpose The only other alternative seems to be to choose between the ultra protectionist position that each increase in a tariff rate is a good in itself and the extreme opposite view that every reduction is a good however illogical in its relation to other rates If the other is a counsel of perfection this is surely nothing better than a counsel of indolence There has been much ridicule heaped upon the idea of a scientific tariff and justly so if the word scientific is supposed to be used in its strict or scientific meaning Certainly no member of the late Tariff Board ever ventured the opinion that it would be possible to devise a scientific tariff in this sense But it should be remembered that the phrase has been loosely used by politicians and business1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 551 men simply to indicate tariff legislation based on an intelligenit and impartial study of the probable effects of proposed changes on pro ducers prices oni consumers prices and on revenue It is not a question of a scientific tariff but of an intelligent tariffthat is a tariff so arranged as to bring about the results really intended Surely it is important to know that in the case of one commodity a given reduction will probably force the home producer to sell below cost without reducing the price to the consumer while in the case of another commodity the same reduction will bring about a mater ial fall in the consumers price while still leaving a living profit to the manufacturer If we are to continue long as now seems certain our present tariff system with duties on thousands of articles produced at home it is obvious that an intelligent tariff even where primarily for revenue should be so designed as to give the greatest aid to the home producer with the least cost to the consumeror to put it conversely the greatest gain to the consumer with the least dis turbance possible to profitable business To do this requires a careful and detailed analysis of marketing conditions and of the relation of producers and consumers prices Such a study is not at all outside the lines of the possible or even the practical At best a tariff must be a matter of pretty rough adjust inents Scientific accuracy is of course a chimera but this does not miean that a fair appreciation of the results of tariff changes should not be attempted or that a decent approximation to this end can not be miade Such efforts to be of value should be not sporadic but continuous Fortunately they are cumulative in their results so that each successive year would make the task easier the results more certain No one who has observed the work of the permanent officials of the departments of Commerce and of Finance in Vienna for example in their detailed study of the economic effects of tariff rates can question this fact HENRY C EMERY Yale University SUPPLEMENTARY NOTE It is not possible to discuss in detail the relations of the above article to Taussigs Some Aspects of the Tariff Question which appeared after the article had been written It is only hoped that it will be accepted by Professor Taussig and by the reader in general as written with something of the same patient regard for concrete realities which characterizes that work and in harmony with his method of treatment even if not agreeing with every detail of552 Henry C Emery September his conclusions The writings of Professor Taussig on the tariff form a conspicuous contrast to much of the general discussion of the question as criticised in the foregoing pages In his new volume he not only continues in brilliant manner the direct investigation of particular caseswhich he calls the only method applicable to this sort of economic inquirybut he sets an example to all economists in his frank willingness to modify earlier conclusions on the basis of a more detailed study of business facts Indeed any writer who never finds any errors in his first conclusions as to particular tariff effects is more probably afflicted with blindness than with infallibility The present article may in a sense be considered an appendix to his first chapter entitled Duties Imports Prices It would be difficult to compress into such brief space more sound analysis combined with clear recognition of facts It does not however include a consideration of the specific factor so much emphasized above namely the difference between producers price and consumers price Perhaps this factor was considered by Professor Taussig and discarded by him as nones sential The present writer however makes bold to believe that this is just what is necessary to round out and complete the analysis both in that general chapter and in its later applications It will be seen that on some points there are differences but these are rather as to the evidence of facts than of theoretical interpretation Thus Professor Taussig takes it as assured that the price of domestic wool under the old tariff was raised by the full amount of the duty while in the above article importance is attached to what was a widespread opinion of the trade that the price was often higher by only one half the amount of the duty However on this there was no unanimity of opiniion I found the view quite commonly expressed by English dealers Doubt less there are divergences from year to year In any case I am con fident that Professor Taussig would agree with me that the question must be determined in the market place and not in the study A similar problem arises in the case of sugar although the subject is not discussed in the present article Professor Taussig takes sugar as the instance par excellence of continuing imports over a duty which raised the price of the domestic product by the full extent He gives a balance sheet for the year 190910 showing the loss and gain to the government the producers and the consumers The method of com putation seems entirely proper barring perhaps the assumption that the price was increased by 112 cents rather than by the actual amount of the duty on Cuban sugar The interesting question is whether a new era was reached about 1913 It was claimed by shrewd if inter ested students of the situation that in that year conditions had so changed that the price of domestic sugar was higher than the foreign price by less than even the reciprocity rate on the Cuban product and also that a new situation had arisen which would bring the sugar indus try under the category considered by Professor Taussig on page 16 That is it is not a priori certain that all the things we have riglhtly said about sugar prices and the tariff in the past will continue to be applica ble indefinitely1915 The Tariff and the Ultimate Consumer 553 Reference has been made in the above article to pricemaking prac tices ordinarily dismissed as abnormal These are discussed by Pro fessor Taussig with a clear grasp of market actualities He goes far in recognizing the permanence of such seemingly disturbing factors though the present writer will doubtless appear even more extreme Whether there is a real divergence on the question of how far continuous dumping involves a monoply element depends on the definition of mon opoly For example I should take as a typical case a small Kansas miller selling flour in Glasgow cheaper than in Kansas City Here neither tariff nor monopoly in the ordinary sense figures in the problem If however the monopoly conception is held to include all cases where a dealer has a certain customary or personal hold on a part of his market and has to fight by cut prices for another part then it may be admitted that monopoly and dumping go together But in that case monopoly is not the extraordinary but the typical condition I have claimed for myself some of Professor Taussigs patience in the analysis of specific facts I can hardly claim it after what has been said in the body of the article regarding the ordinary tlheory of competitive price He continuously and fearlessly modifies it and limits it as each new complexity appears I have been so impressed by ex ceptions and complexities that I have suggested disregarding the old theory till we have made a new inductive study of price phenomena as they appear in the actual markets

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107328,ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR AND ON SOME OTHER SUBJECTS OF CHEMICAL INQUIRY,I206967,405O XXII ON SOME COMBINATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR AND ON SOME OTHER SUBJECTS OF CHEMICAL INQUIRY BY SIR HUMPHRY DAVY KNT LL D SEC R S READ JUNE 18 I81EI  INTRODUCTION IN THIS PAPER I SHALL DO MYSELF THE HONOUR OF LAYING BEFORE THE SOCIETY THE RESULTS OF SOME EXPERIMENTS ON PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR WHICH ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF SOME NEW COM POUNDS AND WHICH OFFER DECIDED EVIDENCES IN FAVOUR OF AN IDEA THAT HAS BEEN FOR SOME TIME PREVALENT AMONGST MANY ENLIGHT ENED CHEMISTS AND WHICH I HAVE DEFENDED IN FORMER PAPERS PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NAMELY THAT BODIES UNITE IN DEFINITE PROPORTIONS AND THAT THERE IS A RELATION BETWEEN THE QUANTITIES IN WHICH THE SAME ELEMENT UNITES WITH DIFFERENT ELEMENTS I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A MINUTE DETAIL OF THE METHODS OF EX PERIMENTING THAT I EMPLOYED I SHALL CONFINE MYSELF TO GENERAL STATEMENTS OF THE FACTS THE COMMON MANIPULATIONS OF CHE MISTRY ARE NOW TOO WELL KNOWN TO REQUIRE ANY NEW ILLUSTRA TIONS AND TO DWELL UPON FAMILIAR OPERATIONS WOULD BE TO OCCUPY UNNECESSARILY AND TEDIOUSLY THE TIME OF THIS LEARNED BODY MDCCCXIISIR H DAVY ON SOME COMBINATZONS 2 OF SOME COMBINIATIONS OF PHOSPHORUS IN A PAPER READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN 810O I HAVE DESCRIBED THE MUTUAL ACTION OF PHOSPHORUS AND OXYMURIATIC GAS OR CHLORINE I HAVE NOTICED TWO COMPOUNDS WHICH APPEAR TO BE DISTINCT AND PECULIAR BODIES FORMED BY THE UNION OF THE GAS AND THE INFLAMMABLE SUBSTANCE ONE IS SOLID WHITE AND CRYSTALLINE IN ITS APPEARANCE EASILY VOLATILE AND CAPABLE OF FORMING A FIXED INFUSIBLE SUBSTANCE BY UNITING WITH AMMONIA THE OTHER IS FLUID LIMPID AS WATER AND AS I HAVE SINCE FOUND OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY 45 IT PRODUCES DENSE FUMES BY ACTING UPON THE WATER OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE GRADUALLY DISAPPEARS LEAVING NO RESIDUUM THE COMPOSITION OF THE WHITE SUBLIMATE IS VERY EASILY AS CERTAINED BY SYNTHETICAL EXPERIMENTS SUCH AS I HAVE DESCRIBED ON A FORMER OCCASION IN THE TRANSACTIONS BY EMPLOYING CHLORINE DRIED BY MURIATE OF LIME IN GREAT EXCESS AND MAKING THE EXPERIMENTS IN EXHAUSTED VESSELS AND ADMITTING SOLUTION OF CHLORINE TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF GAS ABSORBED I HAVE ASCERTAINED THAT 3 GRAINS OF PHOSPHORUS UNITE WITH ABOUT 20 GRAINS OF CHLORINE TO FORM THE SUBLIMATE IF THE PHOSPHORUS BE IN GREAT EXCESS IN THE EXPERIMENT OF ITS COMBUSTION IN CHLORINE SONE OF THE LIQUOR IS FORMED WITH THE SUBLIMATE BUT TO OBTAIN IT IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES PHOS PHORUS SHOULD BE PASSED IN VAPOUR THROUGH HEATED POWDERED CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE A BENT GLASS TUBE MAY BE USED FOR THE PROCESS AND THE LIQUOR CONDENSED IN A COLD VESSEL CONNECTED WITH THE TUBE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS COMPOSITION BY SYN THETICAL EXPERIMENTS  BUT BY POURING IT GRADUALLY INTO WATER 4 06OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR C SUFFERING THE WATER TO BECOME COOL AFTER EACH ADDITION OF THE LIQUOR AND THEN PRECIPITATING THE SOLUTION BY SOLUTION OF NITRATE OF SILVER I HAVE ASCERTAINED THE QUANTITY OF CHLORINE AND OF PHOSPHORUS IT CONTAINS 136 GRAINS TREATED IN THIS WAY AF FORDED 43 GRAINS OF HORN SILVER IT IS EVIDENT FROM THIS ANALYSIS COMPARED WITH THE RESULT OF THE SYNTHETICAL EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUBLIMATE THAT THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS BEING THE SAME THE SUBLIMATE CONTAINS DOUBLE AS MUCH CLORINE AS THE LIQUOR WHEN PHOSPHORUS IS HEATED IN THE LIQUOR A PORTION IS DIS SOLVED AND IT THEN WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ATMOSPHERE LEAVES A FILM OF PHOSPHORUS WHICH WHEN THE LIQUOR IS THROWN ON PAPER USUALLY INFLAMES A SUBSTANCE OF THIS KIND WAS FIRST PROCURED BY M M GAY LUSSAC AND THENARD BY DISTILLING PHOPHORUS AND CALOMEL TOGETHER AND IT MAY BE PRODUCED IN THE EXPERI MENT WITH CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE IF SUFFICIENT HEAT BE USED TO SUBLIME THE PHOSPHORUS OR IF THERE BE NOT AN EXCESS OF THE CORROSIVE SUBLIMATE I HAVE MADE NO EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS THE LIQUOR WILL DISSOLVE WHEN THE WHITE SUBLIMATE IS MADE TO ACT UPON WATER IT DISSOLVES IN IT PRODUCING MUCH HEAT THE SOLUTION EVAPO RATED AFFORDS A THICK LIQUID WHICH IS A SOLUTION OF PURE PHOS PHORIC ACID OR A HYDRAT OF PHOSPHORIC ACID WHEN THE LIQUOR IS TREATED WITH WATER IN THE SAME WAY IT FURNISHES LIKEWISE A THICK FLUID OF THE CONSISTENCE OF SYRUP WHICH CRYSTALLIZES SLOWLY BY COOLING AND FORMS TRANSPARENT PARALLELOPIPEDONS THIS SUBSTANCE HAS VERY SINGULAR PROPERTIES WHEN IT IS HEATED PRETTY STRONGLY IN THE AIR IT TAKES FIRE AND BURNS BRIL LIANTLY EMITTING AT THE SAME TIME GLOBULES OF GAS THAT INFLAME 3 GS 407SIR H DAVY ON SOME COMBINATIONS AT THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUID THIS SUBSTANCE MAY BE CALLED HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID FOR IT CONSISTS OF PURE PHOSPHOROUS ACID AND WATER THIS IS PROVED BY THE ACTION OF AMMONIACAL GAS UPON IT WHEN IT IS HEATED IN CONTACT WITH AMMONIA WATER IS EXPELLED AND PHOSPHITE OF AMMONIA FORMED AND IT IS LIKE WISE SHEWN BY THE RESULTS OF ITS DECOMPOSITION IN CLOSE VESSELS WHICH ARE PHOSPHORIC ACID AND A PECULIAR COMPOUND OF PHOS PHORUS AND HYDROGEN TEN PARTS IN WEIGHT OF THE CRYSTALLINE ACID I FOUND PRODUCED ABOUT 85 PARTS OF SOLID PHOSPHORIC ACID AND THE ELASTIC PRO DUCT MUST OF COURSE HAVE FORMED THE REMAINDER OF THE WEIGHT ALLOWING FOR A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE SUBSTANCE NOT DECOM POSED THE PECULIAR GAS IS NOT SPONTANEOUSLY INFLAMMABLE BUT EXPLODES WHEN MIXED WITH AIR AND HEATED TO A TEMPERATURE RATHER BELOW 212 ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY APPEARED FROM AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH A SMALL QUANTITY OF IT ONLY WAS WEIGHED TO BE TO THAT OF AIR NEARLY AS 87 TO IOO WATER ABSORBED ABOUT ONEEIGHTH OF ITS VOLUME OF THIS GAS ITS SMELL WAS DISAGREEABLE BUT NOT NEARLY SO FETID AS THAT OF COMMON PHOSPHURETTED HYDROGENE WHEN IT WAS DETONATED WITH OXYGENE IT WAS FOUND THAT THREE OF IT IN VOLUME ABSORBED MORE THAN FIVE IN VOLUME OF OXYGENE AND A LITTLE PHOSPHORUS WAS PRECIPITATED WHEN POTASSIUM WAS HEATED IN CONTACT WITH IT ITS VOLUME INCREASED RAPIDLY TILL IT BECAME DOUBLE AND THEN NO FURTHER EFFECT WAS PRODUCED THE POTASSIUM WAS PARTLY CONVERTED INTO A SUBSTANCE HAVING ALL THE CHARACTERS OF PHOSPHURET OF POTASSIUM AND THE RESIDUAL GAS ABSORBED THE SAME QUANTITY OF OXYGENE BY DETONATION AS PURE HYDROGENE WHEN SULPHUR 408OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR C 409 WAS SUBLIMED IN THE GAS OVER MERCURY THE VOLUME WAS LIKE WISE DOUBLED A COMPOUND OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR WAS FORMED AND THE ELASTIC FLUID PRODUCED HAD ALL THE CHARACTERS OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGENE IT APPEARS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE PECULIAR GAS CONSISTS OF 45 OF HYDROGENE IN WEIGHT TO 925 PHOSPHORUS AND ITS COMPOSITION BEING KNOWN IT IS EASY TO DETERMINE THE COMPOSITION OF THE HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID AND LIKEWISE THE QUANTITYOF OXYGENE REQUIRED BY A GIVEN QUANTITY OF PHOSPHO ROUS ACID TO BE CONVERTED INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID FOR FOR EVERY VOLUME OF GAS DISENGAGED A VOLUME OF OXYGENE MUST HAVE BEEN FIXED IN THE PHOSPHORIC ACID AND CALCULATING FOR 174 GRAINS 30 PARTS OF OXYGENE MUST BE FIXED IN THE 150 PARTS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID AND 20 PARTS OF PHOSPHORUS DISENGAGED IN COMBINATION WITH 4 PARTS OF HYDRO GENE AND ON THE IDEA OF REPRESENTING THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH BODIES COMBINE BY NUMBERS IF HYDROGENE BE CONSIDERED AS UNITY AND WATER AS COMPOSED OF TWO PROPORTIONS OF HYDRO GENE 2 AND ONE OF OXYGENE 15 PHOSPHORUS WILL BE REPRE SENTED BY 20 WHEN THE COMPOUNDS OF CHLORINE AND PHOSPHORUS ARE ACTED ON BY A SMALL QUANTITY OF WATER MURIATIC ACID GAS IS DISENGAGED WITH VIOLENT EBULLITION THE WATER IS DECOMPOSED AND IT IS EVI DENT THAT FOR EVERY VOLUME OF HYDROGENE DISENGAGED IN COM BINATION WITH THE CHLORINE HALF A VOLUME OF OXYGENE MUST BE COMBINED WITH THE PHOSPHORUS AND THE PRODUCTS OF THE MU SUPPOSING IOO CUBICAL INCHES OF THE GAS TO WEIGH 27 GRAINS 27  45 THE WEIGHT OF ZOO CUBICAL INCHES OF HYDROGENE  225 GRAINS T THIS MODE OF ESTIMATION IS THE SAME AS THAT I HAVE ADOPTED ON A FORMER OCCASION EXCEPT THAT THE NUMBER REPRESENTING OXYGENE IS DOUBLED TO AVOID A FRACTIONAL PARTSIR H DAVY ON SOME CCOMBINATIONS TUAL DECOMPOSITION OF WATER AND THE PHOSPHORIC COMPOUNDS OF CHLORINE ARE MERELY THE PHOSPHORIC ACID FROM THE SUBLIMATE AND THE PHOSPHOROUS ACID FROM THE LIQUOR AND MURIATIC ACID GAS SO THAT THE QUANTITY OF PHOSPHORUS BEING THE SAME IT IS EVIDENT THAT PHOSPHORIC ACID MUST CONTAIN TWICE AS MUCH OXY GENE AS PHOSPHOROUS ACID WHICH HARMONIZES WITH THE RESULTS OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID FOR SUPPOSING WATER TO BE COMPOSED OF TWO PROPORTIONS OF HYDROGENE AND ONE OF OXYGENE AND THE NUMBER REPRESENTING IT 17 THEN 174 PARTS OF HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID MUST CONSIST OF TWO PROPORTIONS 34 PARTS OF WATER AND FOUR PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID CONTAINING 80 OF PHOSPHORUS AND 60 OF OXYGENE AND THREE PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHORIC ACID MUST BE FORMED CONTAINING THREE PROPORTIONS OF PHOSPHORUS 6O AND SIX PROPORTIONS OF OXYGENE GO MAKING 150 IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO IMAGINE MORE PERFECT DEMONSTRATIONS OF THE LAWS OF DEFINITE COMBINATION THAN THOSE FURNISHED IN THE MUTUAL ACTION OF WATER AND THE PHOSPHORIC COMPOUNDS NO PRODUCTS ARE FORMED EXCEPT THE NEW COMBINATIONS NEITHER OXY GENE HYDROGENE CHLORINE NOR PHOSPHORUS IS DISENGAGED AND THEREFORE THE RATIO IN WHICH ANY TWO OF THEM COMBINE BEING KNOWN THE RATIOS IN WHICH THE REST COMBINE IN THESE CASES MAY BE DETERMINED BY CALCULATION I CONVERTED PHOSPHORUS INTO PHOSPHORIC ACID BY BURNING IT IN A GREAT EXCESS OF OXYGENE GAS OVER MERCURY IN A CURVED GLASS TUBE AND HEATED THE PRODUCT STRONGLY I FOUND IN SEVERAL PRO CESSES OF THIS KIND THAT FOR EVERY GRAIN OF PHOSPHORUS CONSUMED FOUR CUBICAL INCHES AND A HALF OF OXYGENE GAS WERE ABSORBED WHICH GIVES PHOSPHORIC ACID AS COMPOSED OF 20 OF PHOSPHORUS TO 3O6 OF OXYGENE A RESULT AS NEAR AS CAN BE EXPECTED TO THE 410OOF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR C RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUBLIMATE AND THE LYDROPHOS PHOROUS ACID UNLESS THE PRODUCT OF THE COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS IS STRONGLY HEATED IN OXYGENE THE QUANTITY OF OXYGENE ABSORBED IS LESS SO THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT PHOSPHOROUS ACID IS FORMED AS WELL AS PHOSPHORIC ACID PHOSPHOROUS ACID IS USUALLY DESCRIBED IN CHEMICAL AUTHORS AS A FLUID BODY AND AS FORMED BY THE SLOW COMBUSTION OF PHOS PHORUS IN THE AIR BUT THE LIQUID SO PROCURED IS I FIND A SOLU TION OF A MIXTURE OF PHOSPHOROUS AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS AND THE VAPOUR ARISING FROM PHOSPHORUS IN THE AIR AT COMMON TEM PERATURES IS A COMBINATION OF PHOSPHOROUS ACID AND THE AQUE OUS VAPOUR IN THE AIR AND IS NOT I FIND PERCEIVED IN AIR ARTIFI CIALLY DRIED IN THIS CASE THE PHOSPHORUS BECOMES COVERED WITH A WHITE FILM WHICH APPEARS TO BE PURE PHOSPHOROUS ACID AND IT SOON CEASES TO SHINE A SOLID ACID VOLATILE AT A MODERATE DEGREE OF HEAT MAY BE PRODUCED BY BURNING PHOSPHORUS IN VERY RARE AIR AND THIS SEEMS TO BE PHOSPHOROUS ACID FREE FROM WATER BUT SOME PHOSPHORIC ACID AND SOME YELLOW OXIDE OF PHOSPHORUS ARE ALWAYS FORMED AT THE SAME TIME THE PECULIAR GAS DIFFERS EXCEEDINGLY FROM PHOSPHORETTED HY DROGENE FORMED BY THE ACTION OF EARTHS AND ALKALIES AND PHOSPHO RUS UPON WATER FOR THIS LAST GAS IS SPONTANEOUSLY INFLAMMABLE AND ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS SELDOM MORE THAN HALF AS GREAT AND IT DOES NOT AFFORD MORE THAN I5 ITS VOLUME OF HYDROGENE WHEN DECOMPOSED BY POTASSIUM IT DIFFERS IN ITS QUALITIES IN DIFFERENT CASES AND PROBABLY CONSISTS OF DIFFERENT MIXTURES OF HYDROGENE WITH A PECULIAR GAS CONSISTING OF 2 PARTS OF HYDROGENE AND 41 TSSIR H DAVY ON SOME COMBINATIONS 20 OF PHOSPHORUS OR IT MUST CONTAIN SEVERAL PROPORTIONS OF HYDROGENE TO ONE OF PHOSPHORUS I VENTURE TO PROPOSE THE NAME HYDROPHOSPHORIC GAS FOR THE NEW GAS AND ACCORDING TO THE PRINCIPLES OF NOMENCLATURE I HAVE PROPOSED IN THE LAST BAKERIAN LECTURE THE LIQUOR CON TAINING 20 OF PHOSPHORUS TO 67 OF CHLORINE MAY BE CALLED PBOS PHORANE AND THE SUBLIMATE PBOSPBORANA 3 OF SOME COMBINATIONS OF SULPBUR I HAVE SHEWN IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANS ACTIONS FOR 181O THAT SULPHURETTED HYDROGENE IS FORMED BY THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURIN HYDROGENE AND I HAVE SUPPOSED THAT SUL PHUREOUS ACID IN LIKE MANNER IS CONSTITUTED BY A SOLUTION OF SULPHUR IN OXYGENE THERE IS ALWAYS A LITTLE CONDENSATION OF VO LUME IN EXPERIMENTS ON THE COMBUSTION OF SULPHUR IN OXYGENE BUT THIS MAY FAIRLY BE ATTRIBUTED TO SOME HYDROGENE LOOSELY COM BINED IN THE SULPHUR AND TO THE PRODUCTION OF A LITTLE SULPHURIC ACID BY THE MUTUAL ACTION OF HYDROGENE OXYGENE AND SULPHUR IT IS ONLY NECESSARY IF THESE DATA BE ALLOWED TO KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS AND OXYGENE AND SULPLURETTED HYDROGENE AND HYDROGENE TO DETERMINE THEIR COMPOSITION IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 18O1 PAGE 54 I HAVE SOMEWHAT UNDERRATED THE WEIGHTS OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGENE AND SULPHUREOUS ACID GASSES FOR I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT THE CUBICAL INCH MEASURES EMPLOYED FOR ASCERTAINING THE VOLUMES OF GAS WEIGHED WERE NOT CORRECT FROM EXPERIMENTS WHICH I THINK MAY BE DEPENDED UPON AS THE WEIGHTS OF THE GASSES WERE MERELY COMPARED WITH THOSE OF EQUAL VOLUMES OF COMMON AIR I FOUND THAT 1 OO CUBICAL INCHES OF SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS WEIGHED 68 GRAINS 412OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR C 413 AT MEAN TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE AND IOO CUBICAL INCHES OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGENE 365 GRAINS AND THE LAST RESULT AGREES VERY NEAIRLY WITH ONE GIVEN BY MM GAY LUSSAC AND THE NARD AND ONE GAINED BY MY BROTHER MR JOHN DAVY IF 3 THE WEIGHT OF 1OO CUBICAL INCHES OF OXYGENE GAS BE SUBTRACTED FROM 68 IT WILL APPEAR THAT SULPHUREOUS ACID CON SISTS OF EQUAL WEIGHTS OF SULPHUR AND OXYGENE AN ESTIMATION WHICH AGREES VERY NEARLY WITH ONE GIVEN BY M BERZELIUS AND IF 227 THE WEIGHT OF LOO CUBICAL INCHES OF HYDROGENE BE SUBTRACTED FROM 365 THE REMAINDER 3I23 WILL BE THE QUAN TITY OF SULPHUR IN THE GAS AND THE NUMBER REPRESENTING SUL PHUR MAY BE STATED AS 3O AND SULPHUREOUS ACID AS COMPOSED OF OINE PR PORTION OF SULPUR 30 AND TWO OF OXYGENE O0 AND SULPHURETTED HLYDROGENE AS COMPOSED OF ONE PROPORTION OF SUL PHUR AND TWO OF HYDROGENE FROM THE EXPERIMENTS OF MM GAY LUSSAC IT APPEARS THAT SULPHURIC ACID DECOMPOSED BY HEAT AFFORDS ONE VOLUME OF OXY GENE TO TWO OF SULPHUREOUS ACID FROM THIS IT WOULD APPEAR TO BE COMPOSED OF ONE PROPORTION OF SULPHUR TO THREE OF OXYGENE I HAVE ENDEAVOURED IN SEVERAL TRIALS BY COMMON HEAT AND BY ELECTRICITY TO COMBINE SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS WITH OXYGENE SO AS TO FORM A SULPHURIC ACID FREE FROM WATER BUT WITHOUT SUCCESS AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THREE PROPORTIONS OF OXYGENE CANNOT BE COM BINED WITH ONE PROPORTION OF SULPHUR EXCEPT BY THE INTERMEDIUM OF WATER MR DALTON HAS SUPPOSED THAT THERE IS A SOLID SUL PHURIC ACID FORMED BY THE ACTION OF SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS UPON NITROUS ACID GAS BUT I FIND THAT WHEN DRIED SULPHUREOUS ACID GAS AND NITROUS ACID GAS ARE MIXED TOGETHER THERE IS NO ACTION BUT BY INTRODUCING THE VAPOUR OF WATER THEY FORM TOGETHER A SOLID CRYSTALLINE HYDRAT WHICH WHEN TILROWN INTO MDCCCXI 3 HSIR H DAVY ON SOME COMBINATIONS WATER GIVES OFF NITROUS GAS AND FORMS A SOLUTION OF SULPHURIC ACID I HAVE REFERRED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS TO THE COMBINATION OF CHLORINE AND SULPHUR I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM NO COMPOUND OF THESE BODIES WHICH DOES NOT DEPOSIT SULPHUR BY THE ACTION OF WATER WHEN SULPHUR IS SATURATED WITH CHLO RINE AS IN DR TIIHMSONS SULPHURETTED LIQUOR IT APPEARS TO CONTAIN FROM MY EXPERIMENTS ONLY 67 OF CHLORINE TO SO OF SULPHUR 4 SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS IT IS A FACT WORTHY OF NOTICE THAT PHOSPHORIC AND SULPHURIC ACIDS SHOULD CONTAIN THE SAME QUANTITV OF OXYGENE TO THE SAME QUANTITY OF INFLAMMABLE MATTER AND YET THAT THE OXYGENE SHOULD BE COMBINED IN THEM WITH SUCH DIFFERENT DEGREES OF AFFINITY PHOSPHOROUS ACID HAS A GREAT TENDENCY TO UNITE WITH OXYGENE AND ABSORBS IT EVEN FROM WATER AND SULPHUREOUS ACID CAN ONLY RETAIN IT WHEN WATER IS PRESENT THE RELATION OF WATER TO THE COMPOSITION OF MANY BODIES HAS ALREADY OCCUPIED THE ATTENTION OF SOME DISTINGUISHED CHEMISTS AND IS WELL WORTHY OF BEING FURTHER STUDIED MOST OF THE SUB STANCES OBTAINED BY PRECIPITATION FROM AQUEOUS SOLUTIONS ARE I FIND COMPOUNDS OF WATER THUS ZIRCONA MAGNESIA SILICA WH N PRECIPITATED AND DRIED AT 2 S STILL CONTAIN DEFITRITE PROPORTIONS OF WATER AND MANY OF THE SUBSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED AS METALLIC OXIDES T TAT I HAVE EXAMINED OBTAINED TROAM SOLUTIONS AGREE IN TILS RESPECT AND THEIR COLOURS AND OTHER PROPERTIES ARE MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THIS COMBINED WATER I SHALL GIVE AN INSTANCE THE SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS BEEN CALLED THE WHITE OXIDE OF MANGANESE IS A COMPOUND OF WATER AND THE 414OF PHOSPHORUS AND SULPHUR SC 415 PROTOXIDE OF MANGANESE AND WHEN HEATED STRONGLY IT GIVES OFF ITS WATER AND BECOMES A DARK OLIVE OXIDE IT HAS BEEN OFTEN SUSPECTED THAT THE CONTRACTION OF VOLUME PRODUCED IN THE PURE EARTHS BY HEAT IS OWING TO THE EXPULSION3 OF WATER COMBINED WITH THEM THE FOLLOWING FACT SEEMS TO CONFIRM THIS SUSPICION AND OFFERS A CURIOUS PHENOMENON ZIRCONA PRECIPITATED FROM ITS SOLUTION IN MURIATIC ACID BY AN ALKALI AND DRIED AT A TEMPERATURE BELOW 30OO APPEARS AS A WHITE POWDER SO SOFT AS NOT TO SCRATCH GLASS WHEN HEATED TO 70Q OR 800 WATER IS SUDDENLY EXPELLED FROM IT AND NOTWITH STANDING THE QUANTITY OF VAPOUR FORMED IT BECOMES AT THE MOMENT RED HOT AFTER THE PROCESS IT IS FOUND HARSH TO THE FEEL HAS GAINED A TINT OF GRAY ITS PARTS COHERE TOGETHER AND IT IS BECOME SO HARD AS TO SCRATCH QUARTZ

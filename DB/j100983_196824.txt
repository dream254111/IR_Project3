j100983,Journal of the American Geographical Society of New York,196824,Map Notices,i210215,MAP NOTICES BY HENRY GANNETT Since our last notice the U S Geological Survey has published nine sheets Three of these are in New York State and as is the case with all the work done in the State they are upon a scale of I 62500 the relief being expressed by contours with an interval of 20 These three sheets are in the northwest portion of the State and are designated as Medina Albion and Oak Orchard the last named being on the south shore of Lake Ontario the others being respectively south and southwest of it One sheet Apishapa upon a scale of I 125000 and with a con tour interval of 25 represents an area of nearly iooo square miles upon the plains of Colorado The northeastern part of this area consists of typical plains with their undulating surface The re maining portion however is a plateau region in which the streams have cut heavy cafnons and whose surface is broken with buttes and mesas In Idaho is one sheet Hailey upon a scale of I 125000 with a contour interval of ioo This represents a portion of the Salmon River Mountains including the most rugged and highest part of that system Hyndman Peak which stands within this area is so far as known the highest peak in Idaho In Washington is one sheet Seattle upon a scale of I I25000 with a contour interval of 50 which includes the city of that name with the adjacent shores of Puget Sound and the glacial hills and valleys upon its eastern shores In Oregon is one sheet Portland upon a scale of i 62500 with a contour interval of 25 It includes the metropolis of Oregon with the lower course of Willamette River and a portion of the Columbia In California are two sheets both upon a scale of I 62500 One in the northern part of the State includes Mount Shasta Indeed the summit and slopes of this great mountain occupy almost the entire sheet An examination of this map impresses the reader with the newness of the mountain indeed since it was erected stream erosion has made but little impression upon it and little of its substance has been wasted away The cafions and 78Map Notices 79 gorges upon its sides are of slight dimensions The other sheet in California lies east of San Francisco Bay and is known as Con cord It includes a portion of the coast ranges New map of California and Nevada I895 published by Whitaker  Ray Co San Francisco scale J2 miles to I relief is expressed by crayon shading Of the map of Sweden published by the general staff upon a scale of i 200000 two sheets have been issued Upon these the relief is expressed by a combination of hachures and contours That the Government survey of Mexico is progressing is evi denced by the fact that four additional sheets have appeared These are on a scale of I IOO1000 and relief is expressed by con tours with an interval of 50 metres A relief map of northern Sweden has appeared It is published upon a scale of I 500ooo Degrees of elevation are shown by a series of tints of yellows and browns Of the map of the Netherlands upon a scale of I 25000 twenty five additional sheets have appeared Upon these relief is expressed by hachures and the character of the vegetation and of the crops on cultivated land are expressed by colors Among the Dutch maps should be mentioned also the topograph ical map of Bantam Residency Java This map is on a scale of I 100ooo and is composed of nine sheets published in 1897 Relief is expressed by hachures and by colors the character of the vegetation of the soil and of different kinds of crops are repre sented The Geological Survey of England and Wales has published four sheets of an index map This is in effect a general geological map It is otn a scale of four miles to an inch Of the geological map of Wiirtemberg four additional sheets have been issued upon a scale of I 50000 The Geological Survey of Japan has published an agronomic map upon a scale of i IOOOOO showing by colors the character of the soil and of the natural and cultivated products Among the geological folios recently issued by the U S Geo logical Survey is one of an area in southern Colorado about the City of Pueblo known as the Pueblo Folio The maps represent an area of about iooo square miles lying north south and west of the city Besides the maps representing topography areal geology and economic geology which are commonly comprised in these folios there is one representing by shading the rock deformations within80 Map Notices the area the folds and faults but the feature that particularly dis tinguishes this folio is a map showing the distribution of artesian water under this area It represents by colors and depths of color the areas in which a flowing wells can be obtained b pumping wells and c areas in which artesian water cannot be obtained Moreover it shows by means of a species of contour lines the probable depth at which within the artesian areas water will be obtained In an arid region like this where an artesian well is as valuable as a gold mine such maps have a direct economic value almost beyond calculation

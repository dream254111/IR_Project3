J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009707,APPRECIATION AND INTEREST A REJOINDER,I242513,ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY APPRECIATION AND INTEREST A REJOINDER IN JUSTICE TO THE READERS OF MR POWERS REVIEW OF MY  APPRECIATION AND INTEREST  ATTENTION SHOULD BE CALLED TO THE FACT THAT THE REVIEWER HAS FAILED TO UNDERSTAND THE METHODS AND CONCLUSIONS WHICH HE CRITI CISES THE FOLLOWING ARE PATENT INSTANCES I THE INTEREST REALIZED TO LONDON INVESTORS IN THE GOLD AND SILVER GOVERNMENT BONDS OF INDIA DIFFERED PRIOR TO 1875 BY TWOTENTHS OF ONE PER CENT I ALLOW ONE OF THESE TENTHS FOR THE TROUBLE AND EXPENSE OF CONVERTING RUPEE INTEREST BILLS INTO POUNDS STERLING MR POWERS COMMENT IS THE HALVING OF THIS AMOUNT ON THE ASSUMPTION OF RE MOTE PREVISION SEEMS UNWARRANTED AND IS UNCOMFORTABLY SUGGESTIVE HE WOULD ASCRIBE BOTH TENTHS TO  FRICTION OF EXCHANGE EQUIVALENT TO A COMMISSION OF 5 PER CENT ON THE INCOME FROM THE BONDS IF HE HAD EXAMINED PAGE 51 HE WOULD HAVE NOTED THAT THE EXTRA TENTH IS THERE THROWN INTO THE BALANCE SIMPLY TO MAKE THE RESULT A ROUND NUM BER MY CONCLUSION IS THEREFORE TOTALLY UNAFFECTED BY THE  HALVING MR POWERS OMITS TO STATE THAT THIS  HALVING  HAD IT REALLY MATTERED WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE OF BUT ONE FOURTEENTH PART IN THE FINAL RESULT 2 BUT WHAT SHALL BE SAID WHEN SILVER BONDS PAYABLE ON THREE MONTHS NOTICE ARE COMPARED WITH GOLD BONDS RUNNING FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS  IS THERE NOTHING IN THIS PERMANENCY OF INVESTMENT CALCULATED TO TEMPT CAPITAL AND LOWER THE RATE OF INTEREST  IT IS DIFFICULT TO EXCUSE THE OMISSION OF A FACTOR WHICH IS ITSELF SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MAJOR PART OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE INTEREST RATE THE OMISSION WAS NOT MADE WHATEVER PREFERENCE  PERMANENCY OF INVESTMENT  GAVE THE GOLD BONDS EXISTED BEFORE 1875 AS WELL AS AFTER BY CASTING OUT THE TOTAL DIFFERENCE OF INTEREST TWOTENTHS EXISTING BEFORE 1875 FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF INTEREST EXISTING AFTERWARD ANY EFFECT OF A DIFFERENCE OF PERMANENCY MUST HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED MR POWERS IN HIS ANXIETY TO CONTROVERT ME AT TWO DIFFERENT POINTS DOES NOT OBSERVE THAT HIS OWN CLAIMS CONTROVERT EACH OTHER BY PREVIOUSLY ASCRIBING ALL OF THE TWOTENTHS TO FRICTION OF EXCHANGE HE LEFT NO ROOM FOR THE INFLUENCE OF PERMANENCY OF INVESTMENT MUCH LESS FOR THE MAJOR PART OVERFOURTENTHS OF THE DIFFERENCE IN THE INTEREST RATE  AFTER I875 3 THE CONCLUSION DRAWN FROM A COMPARISON OF INTEREST IN GOLD AND SILVER USING COUNTRIES IS CERTAINLY STRAINED FROM SUCH A COM PARISON I CAREFULLY REFRAINED I COMPARED THE CHANGES IN INTEREST IN THE TWO SETS OF COUNTRIES P 64 4  BUT THAT WHICH VITIATES THE CONCLUSION MOST OF ALL IS THE NEGLECT OF THE TIME FACTOR   THE CURRENCY BONDS IN THE FIRST COMPARISON ANNALS JANUARY I897 VOL IX PP 12226 282 I IOAPPRECIATION AND INTEREST WERE TO RUN TEN YEARS LONGER THAN THE COIN BONDS THE TIME FACTOR  AND THE ELIMINATION OF THE EFFECT OF DIFFERENCE IN DURATION OF THE BONDS WERE ESPECIAL OBJECTS OF CALCULATION PP 4145 5 MR POWERS MISCONSTRUES MY USE OF  LABOR INTEREST  I EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED ADHERENCE TO THE LABOR STANDARD WAGES WERE EMPLOYED ONLY TENTATIVELY AND AS AN INDEX OF MONEY INCOMES IN GENERAL PP 72 74 MY QUANTITATIVE CONCLUSIONS RESTED NOT ON WAGE STATISTICS BUT ON MR BOWLEYS INCOMESTATISTICS P 72 THESE BY THE WAY LEND NO SUPPORT TO MR POWERS APPARENT ASSUMPTION THAT A RISE OF WAGES TAKES PLACE AT THE EXPENSE OF PROFITS 6  BUT WHEN THE AUTHOR ASSERTS THAT RETAIL PRICES SHOULD BE CON SIDERED INSTEAD OF WHOLESALE AND THAT RENT LABOR AND SERVICES SHOULD BE INCLUDED AS FORMING PART OF THE FAMILY BUDGET HE BETRAYS A TOTAL IGNORANCE OR NEGLECT OF THE REAL RELATION BETWEEN PRICES AND DEBTS MR POWERS HAS MISTAKEN NEGATIVE CRITICISM OF ONE SYSTEM OF INDEX NUMBERS FOR POSITIVE APPROVAL OF ANOTHER I DID NOT PROPOSE TO TAKE THE DOMESTIC PURCHASING POWER AS A MEASURE OF THE VALUE OF MONEY IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE LATTER WE MUST KNOW AS I PARTICULARLY EXPLAINED A SECOND ITEM VIZ MONEY INCOMES PP 72 82 AND IN THIS ITEM ARE INCLUDED THE EFFECTS OF ALL INFLUENCES WHICH MR POWERS SEEMS TO THINK I HAVE OMITTED VIZ THE INFLUENCE OF A CHANGE OF WAGES AND WHOLESALE PRICES ON THE ENTREPRENEURS PROFITS I E HIS INCOME 7 REFERRING TO RISK OF APPRECIATION MR POWERS STATES  DOUBTLESS RISKS INCURRED MUST BE BORNE BUT SHOULD WE OR SHOULD WE NOT BY OUR COLLECTIVE ACTION SEEK TO MINIMIZE THOSE RISKS  CERTAINLY AND SO I STATED EVEN ADDING THAT BIMETALLISM WOULD PROBABLY TEND TO REDUCE RISK PP 8687 8  WHEN IT IS PROPOSED TO FARTHER ELIMINATE RISK THE REMINDER THAT THE INDIVIDUAL MUST NOT ESCAPE HIS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS IS PERNICIOUSLY IRRELEVANT AN EFFORT TO SIDETRACK DISCUSSION WHICH IS AS UNWORTHY AS IT IS UNACADEMIC MR POWERS IS MISTAKEN BOTH AS TO THE EFFORT  AND AS TO THE FACT THE  REMINDER  WAS NOT MENTIONED IN REFERENCE TO PROPOSALS TO REDUCE FUTURE RISKS P 86 BUT IN REFER ENCE TO PROPOSALS TO SCALE EXISTING DEBTS PP 8384 9  BUT THE CLIMAX IS YET TO COME THE GOLD STANDARD IS NOT TO BE REGARDED AS FAVORABLE TO THE CREDITOR BECAUSE NO MAN KNOWS WHETHER UNDER IT PRICES WILL CONTINUE TO FALL OR NOT LET ALONE ALL QUESTION OF AMOUNT INDEED  THEN HOW ABOUT THIS MUCH ASSUMED FORESIGHT BY MEANS OF WHICH MEN WERE TO FORESTALL THESE CHANGES  I NEVER CLAIMED THAT ANYBODY EVER FOREKNEW FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICES MY STATIS TICS SHOWED ONLY A SPECULATIVE FORESIGHT NO ONE DENIES THAT FORESIGHT EXISTS ON THE STOCK EXCHANGE BUT THIS DOES NOT ENABLE US TO FORETELL WHETHER THE BULLS OR BEARS WILL LOSE TOMORROW IF WE COULD FORETELL 283 III112 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THIS THE BULLS AND BEARS COULD DO IT TOO AND THE LOSSES WOULD NOT OCCUR P 85 IO MR POWERS EVEN MISQUOTES MY MAIN CONCLUSION FROM THE STATIS TICS WHICH HE CRITICISES THIS WAS THAT IN ENGLAND THE DEBTORS LOSS DURING THE LAST TWENTY YEARS AMOUNTED TO TWOTHIRDS OF ONE PER CENT PER ANNUM SUBJECT TO A POSSIBLE ERROR OF ONETHIRD OF ONE PER CENT THIS RESULT WAS EXPLAINED AND STATED CAREFULLY IN MANY PASSAGES PP 52 72 73 8O TWICE IT WAS THROWN INTO THE COMPACT FORM FAMILIAR TO STATISTICIANS 24 DY 4 PER CENT PP 73 8O AT MR POWERS HANDS THIS BECOMES FROM 3 TO 2 PER CENT  IRVING

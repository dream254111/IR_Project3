grounds of public policy and by reason of his prior constructive possession In conclusion we desire to suggest that the rights of a finder both of ordinary lost chattels and of treasure trove may be affected by the Code of Virginia sec 2400 which declares that any property derelict or having no rightful owner may be recovered from any person in possession thereof by a bill in equity in the name of the Commonwealth Is lost property in the hands of a finder to be considered  derelict under this section  We ak the question without answer ing it See 2 Schoulers Pers Prop 2d ed sec 15 where it is said that  under the policy of Massachusetts and some other States the first finder of lost goods is treated somewhat as a salvor though perhaps not so favorably and next to the loser the public steps in as the paramount party entitled to the benefit of a dis covery of lost chattels And see Sovern v Yoran 16 Oreg 269 8 Am St Rep 293 where the Oregon statute is construed which requires the finder of lost money above a certain amount to pay if the owner does not appear in one year one half of such money to the county treasurer POWERS OF APPOINTMENT OVER PROPERTYDefinitionA power of ap pointment is an authority conferred on a person enabling him to dispose of an interest vested either in himself or in some third person A power is not abso lute property nor an estate but authority to appoint an estate i e to indicate to whom it shall pass See 41 Am Dec 694 and note Powers of appointment operate on the legal title under the Statute of Uses and the Statute of Wills and in Virginia under the Statute of Grants 2 Min Ins 820 Wms R P 294 Example of a Power Under the Statute of UsesSuppose X conveys land to A and his heirs to such uses as B shall by any deed or by his will appoint and in default of and until such appointment by B to the use of C and his heirs Now let B exercise the power by deed or by will in favor of D Then the use appointed to D is executed by the Statute of Uses and D has the legal title which shifts to him from C who was entitled until appointment by B In the above example the parties are named as follows X is the donor of the power i e its giver and creator A is the feoffee to uses reservoir of seisin B is the donee of the power who by its exercise becomes the appointor C is the person entitled until and in default of appointment by B and D is the appointee i e the person who takes by and under Bs appointment Wms R P 294 Example of a Power Under the Statute of WillsX devises his land to his widow for her life and authorizes her to appoint by her will the said land to his children in such shares as she shall see fit and in default of such appointment he directs that the land be divided equally among his children Here X is the donor of the power his widow is the donee and becomes the appointor in case she appoints Xs children are the objects of the power i e the class among whom the appointment may be made and when it is made to them they become the appointees and those who are entitled in default of appointment are all the children equally See Rhett v Mason 18 Gratt 541 also Morriss v Morriss 33 Gratt 51 McCamant v Nuckolls 85 Va 331 For the Virginia statute as to the validity of appointments made by will in the exercise of a power see Code Va sec 25151897 FOR THE JUNIORS 781 The Several Kinds of Powers1 The donee may have a general power to appoint to any person whatsoever or it may be special as to appoint to or among a particular class e g children only or children and grandchildren etc But though the power is special as to the class the donee may have discretion as to the shares or he may be authorized to appoint if he chooses all to any one of the class See McCamant v Nuckolls 85 Va 331 Thrasher v Ballard 35 W Va 524 Bisph Eq sec 256 2 The power may be a power in trust which the donee must exercise in favor of the objects Here he is a doneetrustee and not to exercise the power will be a breach of the trust Such doneetrustee may have discretion as to the shares to be appointed but if he fails altogether to appoint a court of chancery will divide the property among the objects equally since equality is equity See Bisph Eq sec 77 2 Pom Eq sec 1002 3 The power may be a naked power i e a power not coupled or clothed with a trust Such a power is also called a mere power because it is a power merely without the element of trust Such a mere power not in trust is as to its exercise discretionary with the donee and if he makes no appointment at all a court of chancery will not interfere in favor of those who might have been the appointees See 2 Pom Eq sec 920 Fraud on a PowerIf a power is not exercised in good faith and for the pur pose for which it was created such an exercise will be deemed a fraud on the power and will be set aside in equity on a bill filed by a party in interest i e by a party entitled in default of appointment If the power be a power in trust its improper exercise is of course relieved against in equity in favor of the beneficiaries as in any other case of breach of trust But though the power be a mere power and not in trust and though the donee has a discretion whether he shall appoint or not yet if he does appoint he may do so in such a manner as to commit a fraud upon the power This is where he is restricted by the terms of the instrument conferring the power as to the persons to or among whom he may appoint or in respect to other material matters Here if he appoints in disregard of the restric tions the appointment will be set aside And this will also be done when he makes a corrupt appointment to an object of the power in order to acquire a benefit for himself either directly or indirectly See Bisph Eq sec 256 But if a power is not in trust and the donee has absolute discretion as to the persons to whom he may appoint and as to the shares he cannot commit a fraud on such a power because it could not be said that he had violated the intention of the donor Indeed in such a case he would have a right to appoint to himself Wms R P 294 2 Pom Eq sec 920 For an example of an appointment void because not to an object of the power see Hood v Haden 82 Va 588 where under the power to appoint to children the appointment was made to the issue of a child Aider in Equity of the DeJective Execution of a Power 1 What powers aided  a If the power be in trust and the donee either fails altogether to exercise it or exercises it defectively equity will relieve by way of enforcing the trust See Bisph Eq sec 195 b If the power is not in trust a mere power then as the donee is under no obligation to exercise it if he omits to do so equity will not interfere This is782 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb what is meant by saying that the nonexecution of a power will not be aided in equity c But though the power is a mere power and its exercise discretionary with the donee yet if he has attempted to exercise it and thereby shown his intention to appoint equity will not suffer the appointment to fail because the formalities pre scribed by the donor of the power as to the mode of its exercise have not been fully complied with It is otherwise at law where a power not duly exercised is considered as not exercised at all And even in equity the doctrine of aider of the defective execution of a power is carefully circumscribed 2 What defects aided in equity Only those of form not those of substance And it is considered a formal defect if the instrument of exercise has a less number of witnesses than the donor prescribed but not if when required to be attested there are no witnesses at all See Justice v English 30 Gratt 565 If a power is required to be exercised by deed its exercise by will is considered a formal defect and is aided in equity For what one may do up to death by deed may well be done at death by will But if the exercise is required to be by will then its exercise by deed is a substantial defect and equity will not aid for in this case it is contemplated that the donee shall have the power of revocation and change until he dies a will being ambulatory and this is prevented by a deed Bisph Eq p 249 note a And the power to appoint to females in trust and to their separate use is not aided and fails even in equity if the appointment to them is of legal estates not to their separate use See lIorriss v MIorriss 33 Gratt 51 3 In whose favor aided The appointee must be a purchaser from the donee or a creditor whose debt is to be paid or secured or there must be a meritorious consideration as in the case of an appointment to a wife child or charity Mlor riss v Morriss supra 2 Pom Eq sec 589 Wms R P 299 4 Against whom aided The person entitled in default of appointment must not have as high a claim as the appointee Thus equity will not aid against a bona fide purchaser nor a grandchild against a child nor it is presumed one charity against another For at law the informal appointment is void and hence the title of him who is entitled in default of appointment prevails and equity will not aid the attempted appointment because it is a maxim in equity that when the equities are equal the law will prevail See 1Tollett v Toleit 1 Wh  T L C Eq 369 1 Story Eq Jur sec 177 Bisph Eq sec 195 lorriss v lor riss 33 Gratt 51 N B The equitable doctrine of aider of the defective execution of powers is confined to powers created by the voluntary act of persons in wills deeds and settlements it does not extend to those created and regulated by statute The defective execution of statutory powers in the failure to comply with the prescribed requisites cannot be aided in equity 2 Pom Eq secs 590 834 Thus in Wil liams v Cudd 26 S C 213 4 Am St Rep 714 it is held that equity will not aid the defective execution of a statutory power given a married woman to relin quish her inheritance in lands And the same has been held of the power of a tenant in tail to make leases under the statute of 32 Hen 8 c 28 1 Story Eq sec 177 Wms R P 56 Bisph Eq sec 195

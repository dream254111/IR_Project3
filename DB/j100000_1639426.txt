j100000,Science,1639426,Recent Evidence for the Existence of the Nucleus Atom,i296369,RECENT EFIDENCE FOR THE EXISTENCE OF THE NUCLEUS ATOM THE great French scientist Poincar6 just before his death two years ago de scribed an atom before the French Physical Society in these words Each atom is like a kind of solar system where the small negative electrons play the rOle of planets revolving around the great positive cen tral electron which takes the place of our sun Besides these captive electrons there are others which are free and subject to the ordinary kinetic laws of gases The second class are like the com ets which circulate from one stellar system to another establishing thus an exchange of energy between distant systems Such an atom is a world in itself and strangely different from the kind we learned about in our textbooks twenty years ago One of the much used chem istries of that day put it in this way An atom is the smallest portion of matter that can exist it is incompressible indivisible and in itself unchanaeable How has this great change of view come about How has the indivisible unit evolved into the complex microcosm we now imagine Time would fail us to trace all the steps of the way we will attempt only to bring out some of the considerations which have in the past three years led many of our foremost thinkers to believe in that particular type of atom which we may call the nucleus atom This type is similar to that which Poineare pictured except that the central body is much smallervery 1Address of the vicepresident and chairman of Section B Physics of the American Association for the Advancement of Science at Philadelphia December 29 191474 SCIENCE N S VOL XLI No 1046 small indeed as compared with even the minute electrons which circulate about it We will recall first several of the dis coveries which have forced us to abandon the idea of an indivisible atom The funda mental one was Sir Joseph Thomsons dis covery of the electron In studying the nature of the cathode rays he found that they consisted of extraordinarily minute particles all exactly alike whatever the nature of the gas within the tube might be In a series of brilliant experimental studies he wTas able to show that the mass of one of these electrons was only one eighteen hun dredth that of the lightest known atom Then came Zeeman s discovery2 that the separate lines of many spectra are broken up into two or more lines by the action of strong magnetic fields The study of this effect made it quite certain that light radia tion is caused by the rapid vibration of electrons in the luminous body Therefore electrons must be present in very many kinds of matterprobably in all The elec trons were early proved to carry a negative charge of electricity Soon they revealed their presence in a great variety of ways and assisted in the explanation of widely different phenomena But the correspond ing positive constituent of matter proved singularly elusive although most diligently sought for and it is only very recently that we seem to have traced it to its hidingplace Different views regarding the nature of this positive constituent have led to much diversity of opinion regarding the structure of atoms One of the most successful of these theories is that proposed by Sir Joseph Thomson in 19043 He supposed a relatively large positive mass to exist nearly as large as the atomwith the mi nute negative electrons distributed through it in such a way as to make the system a stable one For easy mathematical treat ment he assumed the electrons at equal distances apart in a series of concentric circular rings To secure stability and illustrate certaini atomic properties he supposed these rings to be in rotation Thonson discussed many such configura tions and satisfactorily explained many facts regarding the valency the position in the periodic system the electropositive or electronegative character and other chem ical properties of different substances A modification of Thomsons atom was proposed by H A Wilson in 19114 He supposes each negative electron to be situ ated at the center of a positive sphere of sufficient size to neutralize it electrically and the atom to be made up of a group of such units the total number being propor tional to the atomic weight In other words Thomsons one relatively large posi tive mass is divided up into equal parts each one containing a single negative elee tron The mathematical development of this idea led to the result that the hydrogen atom contains eight such units The gold atom would therefore contain about six teen hundred of them In the Thomson and the Wilson atoms the positive portion is diffused throughout nearly the whole volume of the atom a region about one hundred millionth of a centimeter in diameter This type of structure has accounted for many atomic properties but has not been very successful in explaining the position of the lines in light spectra caused by vibrations in the atom I wish to direct your attention today more particularly to a type of atom in which the positive chargeequal as before to the sum of the charges of the negative electronsis highly concentrated at the center of volume of the atom occupying only an exceedingly small part of the volume Nagaoka had discussed the sta bility of such an atom in 1904 Sir ErnestJANUARY 15 1915 SCIENCE 76 Rutherford revived it in 1911 to explain phenomena observed by Geiger and Mars den6 and achieved a striking success The facts observed were these when arays were allowed to pass through thin sheets of metal a small proportion of them were ob served to be deflected through very large angles Rutherford7 made a theoretical examination of the results of a single en counter between an aparticle and an atom of the concentratednucleus type and cal culated the proportion of the aparticles which would be deflected through various angles by such encounters Geiger8 then made a new experimental study of the scattering produced by gold foil and found a very satisfactory verification of Ruther fords formula From the amount of scat tering at various angles the valuie of the nucleus charge was also calculated For gold it came out about 100 e The general conclusion was reached that the nucleus charge is about one half the atomic weight times the charge of an electron But Barkla9 had earlier reached the same value for the sum of the electron chargeswhich in a neutral atom should equal the nucleus chargeby observations on Xrays and the use of a theory developed by J J Thom son According to these views atoms con tain only about one sixteenth as many elec trons as they do on the theory of H A Wilson On the assumption that large angles of deflection are sometimes due to single en counters with an atom large forces must be postulated to swing the aparticles so considerably from their paths forces so large as to require an approach to within an exceedingly small distance from the nu cleus center This distance was calculated to be about 13000 of the atom diameter If this is true the nucleus can hardly have a diameter exceeding 15000 that of the atom The view that an aparticle may turn through a large angle as the result of a single encounter was strikingly confirmed in 1912 by some remarkable photographs of the paths of aparticles through a gas taken by C T R Wilson0 I have here a reproduction of one of these photographs which shows two abrupt bends in the trail of a particle one of 1050 and the other of 43  This second bend would certainly seem to be a case of single scattering The astonishing conclusion regarding the small size of the nucleus has been confirmed by some recent experiments of Marsden in passing aradiation through a gas A theory had been worked out by Dar win that when aradiation entered hydro gen a few H atoms would acquire from close encounters with the aparticles a velocity 16 times that of the striking aparticle corresponding to a range four times that of the radiation Marsden s experiments were undertaken to test this theory He passed arays into hydrogen and observed the scintillations on a zinc sul phide screen placed at various distances The range of the aparticles was found to be 20 cm but a few scintillations were found when the screen was as much as 90 cm distant due seemingly to the rapidly moving H atoms in their recoil from colli sion with the heavier aparticles This was a striking confirmation of Darwins theo retical calculations Calculation by his method showed that the centers of the nuclei during collision were not over 17 X 1013 cm apart This then would be the maximum value of the sum of their radii This is smaller even than the former result and also smaller than the accepted value of the diameter of an electron Thus the nucleus of the atom appears to be extraordinarily minute and this suggests an explanation of the somewhat paradoxical result that practically all of the mass of76 SCIENCE EN S VOL XLIL No 1046 the atom seems to reside in the nueleus For if the size is extremely small its elec tromagnetic mass wouldfrom the formula 2 23 be relatively large So its mass a might be 1800 times that of the electron and J J Thomsons experiments suggest that no positive carrier has a mass smaller than that amount provided its diameter were only 11800 that of the electron From such consideration Rutherford12 thinks it probable that the nucleus of the H atom is in fact the longsought positive electron Attention has been forcibly drawn to the nucleus type of atom within the past year and a half by the extraordinary suc cess it has had as interpreted by Bohr Darwin and Moseley in accounting for the exact position of lines in the spectra of gases Their work has also served to bring into the limelight the earlier and perhaps equally striking work of J W Nicholson In November 1911 he published a paper3 in which he assumed the existence of sev eral elements with atoms of very simple and definite structure One of these he called nebulium In the neutral condition it was supposed to have a positive nucleus with charge 4 e and around it at equal distances apart in a circular path rotated four electrons each with unit charge e It might however lose one electron when it would become positively charged its three electrons now taking up new positions a third of a eircumference apart Simi larly he supposed that the atom might take up more electrons and have a negative charge He discussed mathematically the vibra tory motions of such an atom and showed what kind of a spectrum the radiation would furnish The theoretical analysis of the spectrum of his imaginary element nebulium showed that all the characteristic nebula lines of the Great Nebula in Orion leaving out those due to hydrogen and helium could be attributed to the vibrations of the nebulium atom except two lines On the very day he read this paper in England a German astronomer M Wolfl4 presented a paper in Heidelberg which described the discovery that different lines of this nebula were due to radiation from different parts of the nebula and that these two lines which Nicholson had found exceptional were due to a radiating source different from that of the other lines Whereas al most all the lines were due to radiation from the bright ring of the nebula these two lines were caused by radiation from different parts of the nebula that for one of them coming from the dark central space and for the other chiefly from the outer edge of the ring All other lines had their maximum brightness in the brlght ring itself Another imaginary substance which Nicholson named protofluorine he suc ceeded in connecting in a similar way with the spectrum of the suns corona5 This atom he supposes to havewhen neutral a nucleus 5 e with 5 electrons in a circular orbit about it He analyzes its radiation on the assumption that it gives forth radia tion energy in quanta as Planck has sup posed He anticipates Bohr in the empha sis he gives to the idea of constancy of angular momentum in the rotating elec trons His calculations on this protoflu orine atom account satisfactorily for the existence of fourteen out of the twentytwo lines of the corona spectrum with an aver age difference of less than one part in a thousand between observed and calculated values His calculations also show the magnitude of the positive or negative charge of the atoms originating the vari ous lines He concludes that in these primitive forms of matternebule andJANtTARY 5 19151 SCIENCE 77 solar coronavery simple types of atom exist much more simple doubtless and more amenable to calcutation than are the atoms of most terrestrial substances While the correspondence between his calculated spectra and those observed at Lick Observa tory is not so close as is that between theory and observed spectra in the recent work of Bohr it is important to observe that most of these results are obtained by means of established mechanical principles and without the use of such questionable as sumptions as the brilliant young Dane cheerfully and confidently makes And now let us consider briefly the work of Bohr This is set forth in four papers6 published in the Philosophical Magazine between July of last year and March of the present year He starts with the Ruther ford atom i e a minute positive nucleus with its system of electrons revolving about it the mass of the atom resident chiefly in the nucleus and the number of electrons approximately equal to half the atomic weight He admits the difficulty of secur ing stability in such an atom as compared for instance with Thomsons 1904 atom but thinks that this difficulty can be re moved if we admit the insufficiency of the classical dynamics to explain phenomena involving atomic distances and introduce Plancks quantum into the equations He claims that this furnishes a basis not only for a theory of atomic constitution but for that of molecules as well He differs from Nicholson radically in assuming that when in a state of uniform rotation the electrons do not radiate This is not in accordance with our ordinary electrodynamics Each atom according to Bohr has a number of t steady states during which the electrons revolve uniformly and there is no radia tion But in passing from one steady state to another an electron winds inward toward the nucleus with its frequency increasing Its acceleration meanwhile causes radia tlon until the electrons settle into another steady state and ceases for the time to radiate In its stable state the angular momentum of every electron is the same This agrees with Plancks idea of discon tinuous radiation and the amount radiated in one emission for a vibrator of frequeneyf v is rhv where r is some integer and h is Planck s universal constant Rohr finds the equation for the relation between the frequency mass of an electron charge of electron r and h When r is made 2 in the equation Balmers series for hydrogen is obtained and for r  3 the infrared series which Ritz anticipated and Paschen found r 1 gives a series of lines in the ultraviolet and r 4 and 5 in the infra red neither of which has yet been observed The lines observed by Fowler and by Pick ering he connects with helium instead of with hydrogen From this equation he also calculates Ryd bergs number N and obtains 326 X 1O15 Its observed value is 329 X 101 so that the agreement of theory with observation is satisfactory The theory further requires that very low gas density be required for numerous spectrum lines and very great gas volume for sufficient intensity This probably accounts for the fact that 33 lines of the Balmer series for hydrogen can be seen in celestial spectra while only 12 ap pear in terrestrial vacuumtube spectra From the work of Barkla and of Geiger and Marsden on the scattering of radiation Bohr accepts the view of van der Broek that the number of electrons in an atom in the neutral state indicates the position of the element in the periodic table Thus he gives hydrogen one electron helium two lithium three beryllium four etc Th same number expresses the magnitude of the positive charge on the nucleus It is difficult to pass upon the validity of78 SCIENCE N S VOL XLI No 1046 some of Bohrs assumptions So high an authority as Jeans7 calls it  a most in genious and suggestive and I think we must add convincing explanation of the laws of series spectra and yet he adds a little later that the only justification for the assumptions Bohr makes is  the very weighty one of success Rutherford cautiously observes The theories of Bohr are of great interest and importance as a first attempt to construct atoms and molecules and explain their spectra The views of Rutherford and Bohr re garding the structure of atoms are strongly supported by some striking experiments of Moseley published during the past year1 His work utilizes the methods worked out by W H and W L Bragg9 for measuring the spectra obtained by reflectingXrays from the faces of crystals Barkla and Sadler20 showed in 1908 that if Xrays from an ordinary tuLbe fall on different metals characteristic Xrays are given offthese being different for each metal Many metals can give out at least two dif ferent types of radiation Barkla called these the K series and the L series radiations For each metal the IK radi ation is about 300 times as penetrating as the L radiation Kayec2 has shown that an element excited under suitable condi tions by rapid cathode rays gives out a con siderable portion of the Xrays produced in the form of characteristic rays Moseley photographed the spectra ob tained by using a great variety of different metals as targets for cathoderay bombard ment The Xrays so produced were re flected from a crystal face and then fell upon the photographic plate Spectra of the third order showing fine sharp lines were obtained Similar results were se cured for over forty metals For the ele ments of lower atomic weights each spec trum showed two prominent lines and the spectrum of any element was almost ex actly like that of the element next below it in the periodic table except that it was shifted in the direction of shorter wave length by about the distance between its two lines The radiation was of the K type Thus a close relation was estab lished between the Xray wavelength and chemical properties Further the fre quency of the principal line was found to be proportional to Na 2 where N is an integer and a is a constant equal to about unity N is called the atomie number of the element Thus is it 20 for Ca 22 for Ti 23 for Va 24 for Cr 25 for Afn 26 for Fe 27 for Co 28 for Ni 29 for Cu 30 for Zn etc These numbers are very nearly in the orders of the increasing atomic weights but more exactly in the order of Men deleeffs periodic table The numbers then correspond with the changes in chemical properties more nearly than do the atomic weights For instance we have Fe Co Ni representing both the chemical order and order of the atomic numbers 26 27 28 while Fe Ni Co is the order of inereasing atomie weights It thus appears that this atomic number is a more fundamental quan tity than is the atomic weight or as Soddy22 has put it It is the anuclear charge rather than the atomic mass which fixes the position of the element in the Periodic Table A van der Broek25 had before this sug gested that the total number of unit charges on the electrons of an atom is the number representing the position of the element arranged according to increasing atomic weight But in a neutral atom the sum of the negative charges on the elec trons should equal the positive charge on the nucleus so that the two statements amount to the same thing When the experimental values found for the frequency were compared with thoseJANUARY 15 1915 SCIENCE 79 indicated by Bohrs theory the agreement was found to be a remarkably close one With elements of higher atomic weight Moseley obtained spectra whose lines indi cated the Barkla L type2 of radiation The atomic numbers calculated from the positions of the strongest lines of these L spectra ranged from 40 for zirconium to 79 for gold These experiments then give strong support to the hypothesis of van der Broek that the total charge of the electrons of an atom indicates its position in the periodic system Known elements were found to correspond with all the num bers from 13 to 79 except three indicating that three elements probably remain to be discovered The wavelengths of the char acteristic Xrays from the metal is of the order of 11000 that of visible light i e about 40 waves in 000001 inch During the past few months Rutherford and Andrade24 have extended these meth ods of crystal reflection to the study of radiation from RaB RaC The yray spectrum of RaB was found to be of the same general type as that of the Xray spectrum from various heavy metals when bombarded by cathode rays The result for soft yrays from RaB shows that its radiation belongs to the L series  for heavy metals Moseleys formula applied to the measurement of the lines of the yray spectrum gave N  82 which is the atomic number of lead The atomic weight of RaB is however 214 while that of lead is 207 This difference is nevertheless fully explained by a new generalization of Soddy and Fajans which we will presently notice The experiments described in the second paper were made with much more penetra ting yradiation from both RaB and RaC This penetrating yradiation from RaB was found to correspond to the K series for the same metal lead The still more penetrating radiation from RaC has a line spectrum of still higher frequency than the K type for which the name  H  series is sug gested These rays are especially interest ing because they have by far the shortest wavelengths yet known only about 18 of the wavelength of the shortest Xray waves measured by Moseley or about 180000 of the wavelength of sodium light Ruther ford in his comments on these waves very justly remarks It is surprising that the architecture of the crystals is sufficiently definite to resolve such short waves During 1913 some remarkable work on the relations of radioactive substances to each other has given support to the nucleus atom from an unexpected quarter Fleck25 Russell26 Von Hevesey27 Fajans28 and Soddy29 have all had a share in this work They have found that when a radioactive substance ejects an aparticle a substance of different chemical properties and differ ent valency results The new substance lies two columns to the left in the periodic table has an atomic number two less and an atomic weight about four less than the parent substance If however the radioac tive substance ejects a sparticle or elec tron the new substance is one column to the right in the periodic table increases one in atomic number and does not change in atomic weight Plainly then two or more elements may occupy the same posi tion in the periodic table for if an element loses in successionin any ordertwo f3 particles and one aparticle its atomic number will be again the same as it was at first Thus RaD has the atomic number 82 it loses a aparticle and becomes RaE with atomic number 83 this loses another Bparticle and becomes RaF with atomic number 84 this finally loses an aparticle and becomes lead with the original atomic number 82 The series Url Ur X 1 Ur X 2 and Ur2 is of the same kind except that the particles are ejected in the reverse80 SCIENCE N S VOL XLI No 1046 order a 3 fl So the old difficulty of find ing places in the periodic table for the 34 radioactive substances now known has dis appeared since they have but ten different atomic numbers and require therefore but ten places in the periodic table Soddy has introduced the term isotopes to designate two elements occupying the same place in the table Isotopes are chemically insep arable and probably have identical spectra but they have different atomic weights It is evident that much remains to be done before we have very definite ideas of the structure of the nucleus atom Many questions are entirely unanswered For ex ample in how many rings do the electrons lie For hydrogen and helium as for nebu ulium and protofluorine if they exist the electrons are so few that they doubtless all lie in one ring but there are reasons for believing that in atoms of higher atomic weight there are two or more rings With a large number of electrons presentwith the 100 electrons of the gold atom for in stancethere may indeed be several con figurations which will satisfy the condi tions of stability Even for comparatively light atoms Bohr80 supposes that as many as five rings exist Again from what part of the atom of a radioactive substance do these ejected ca and 3particles come Soddytbelieves that both originate in the nucleus but that the chemical and the electrochemical properties are controlled by the outer ring of the electrons Mose ley regards the similarity of the Xray spectra of different metals as satisfactory evidence that such radiation originates in side the atom while light radiation is de termined by the structure of the sur face Rutherford32 and Bohr both raise the important question whether atomic nuclei contain electrons and both conclude that they do These and many other ques tions have already been asked but only tentative and provisional answers have thus far been given Doubtless there is a field here for much important experimental and theoretical work in the immediate fu turea field which American physicists will seek to cultivate with their European brethren who have done about all of the work thus far These hasty considerations perhaps suf fice to show the varied character of the lines of evidence that have been developed during the past three years to give support to some form of nucleus atom Radioactive phenomena Xray radiation and chemical properties seem to give united testimony for it Doubtless the final type of atom has not yet been described for it is easy to criticize the views of Nicholson of Bohr or any other who has proposed a model but it is probable that some form of nucleus atom will soon receive general recognition 1 Poincar6 Annual Rep Smithson Institution 1912 p 199 2 P Zeeman Phil Mag 43 226239 44 5560 and

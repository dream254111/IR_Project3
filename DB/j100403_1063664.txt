ment we have in the past given our thought and confined our exertions almost wholly to the structure of our government with comparatively little thought to the function or province or sphere of action of the various departments Much confusion and unscientific legislation and misdirected efforts have re sulted from this The movement in favor of the initiative and referendum is plainly a discernment of the great function of the people in a democracy and is a means for giving expression to their will The movement in favor of the short ballot is an endeavor to discover the true function of the ballot and to draw the line between offices properly elective and those properly se lective or appointive So the movement in favor of proportional representation is a recognition of the fact that in a truly delib erative assemblage there should be minority representation Without pursuing this further let us consider whether we have properly conceived the function of courts in our democracy That they are instruments by which the organized community exercises its supremacy over the individual is clear Heretofore the courts have been called upon to function regardless of whether the question presented for adjudication arose between the individual and the organized community or State that is to say in the enforcement of our public laws or in purely pri vate disputes between individuals in the enforcement of our private laws In Blackstones analysis public laws are referred to as made up of crimes and misdemeanors When we consider the vast body of public law national State and municipal now existing in this country regulating many of our industrial and social relations and resulting from the cotception of the func tion of government in a democracy as being to serve and not to rule the people and consider the function of our courts to construe interpret apply and decide as to the constitutionality of this vast body of public law and consider further that the decisions of our courts on questions thereunder presented for 276VOLUNTARY TRIBUNALS adjudication affect every man woman and child in the com munity and not purely private interests we may well consider the question whether our public tribunals have properly speak ing any function whatever to perform in the matter of purely private disputes which give rise to the ordinary civil actions This question is of special importance at this time because of the growing disrespect for courts and their administration of our laws We need not attempt an echo here of the prevailing senti ments It is sufficient to remember that so great a jurist as William H Taft refers to our administration of justice as a dis grace to civilization and to remember that our bar associations all over the country are at work endeavoring to devise expedients by which our courts may be relieved of the odium which they at present bear As a result of these efforts we have sugges tions for elastic court rules in place of rigid statutory procedure for liberalizing artificial rules of evidence for simplification of pleadings abolition of terms of court widening the judicial dis cretion and various reforms in appellate procedure Most of these suggested reforms relate to procedure in civil actions and yet a study of the causes of the dissatisfaction of the people with the operation of our courts will show that it is in their admin istration of public laws in the criminal trials and the pronounce ments upon the constitutionality of public measures that the disrespect for courts and administration of laws is evidenced The great mass of our people rarely indulge in private litigation and have but little concern in the termination of purely private disputes so far as the action of the courts is concerned It would seem therefore that our attention should be directed mainly to the administration of public laws if we are to secure that respect for and confidence in the courts which are the vital necessity of organized society It goes without saying that the organization of our courts the methods of selecting and retiring judges are of the utmost importance in the efficient administration of justice But if the best of courts are burdened with the discharge of functions which do not properly belong to them their efficiency is necessarily impaired The differentiation of our laws into substantive and adjective on the one hand and into public and private on the other is 277VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW familiar What the bar of the country is struggling with now is with the adjective law as applied to the administration of private laws Our real trouble is with our substantive public laws and their administration by our courts In the last analysis the function of State tribunals is to administer the public laws of the State and they ought to be relieved of all purely private litigation and not until this is done will the courts rise to their true dignity and importance in organized society While seemingly novel an examination of the trend of affairs in the matter of the disposition of disputes between individuals over private differences which ordinarily give rise to civil actions will reveal a strong tendency towards the avoidance of the reg ularly constituted courts and a resort to arbitration As long ago as 1881 a writer in the Central Law Journal 1 said that busi ness men had found litigation too expensive and too vexatious to satisfy anybody especially in a country where capital is turned over two or three times a year and where the average contested litigation took from two to five years and that they were commencing to look rather to arbitration Since then ar bitration clauses have been inserted in contracts of various kinds in growing numberinsurance railroad construction building foreign grain the bylaws of merchants exchanges stock exchanges etc Though the courts of the country have en couraged these socalled domestic tribunals while recognizing that the justice which they meted out was but rude and crude the bar of the country has instinctively turned against this method of disposing of private differences as being unscientific as an adjudication by nonexperts must necessarily be The Hon William Renwick Riddell recently referred to arbitration as bearing on the practice of law as quackery bore on the practice of medicine and he undoubtedly voiced the sentiment of all true lawyers as against arbitrations by nonprofessionals But be cause we are opposed to nonprofessional arbitration need we be opposed to all arbitration The legislatures of most of our States have enacted arbitration statutes providing for the en forcement of awards of arbitrators voluntarily chosen by private 18 Central L J 101 278VOLUNTARY TRIBUNALS parties and giving to those awards all the force of a judgment of a court of record Cannot the bar of this country utilize these statutes by creating voluntary tribunals that is to say by selecting fellow members of the bar as arbitrators to whom to submit the private differences of their clients and thus at one stroke secure an eminently fit judge relieve themselves of all the embarrassments and entanglements of compulsory statutory pro cedure and relieve the State courts of the necessity of settling private disputes exalting them in the eyes of the people as the public tribunals where questions in which all have an interest are adjudicated This is the proposition covered by the sug gestion as to voluntary tribunals Possibly too idealistic for to day Yes But if a sound democratic ideal presupposing honest lawyers and honest litigants who want only what is right and want that easily and quickly for the advantage of all con cerned if truly democratic in that the individuals do not lean up against the State but settle their private differences between themselves and if founded on a really scientific differentiation between private and public law then we may trust that in the course of time it will prevail It is interesting to notice that this formation of voluntary tribunals for the disposition of private differences is but carrying the latest and most highly developed procedure adopted for the administration of the Roman Civil Law one step further and that in line with our democratic tend encies In the perfected Roman procedure the praetor before whom proceedings were instituted referred the matter in dis pute for decision to a judex or arbiter who in turn was advised as to the law by the juris consulti a class of students who made law their chief study and were the only lawyers engaged in the administration of justice The arbiter was not a lawyer but a citizen of repute selected by the prctor Now the proposition for voluntary tribunals presented here is that the judex or arbiter shall be a lawyer that he shall be selected not by some govern ment official but by the juris consultithat is the lawyers en gaged in the particular caseand that these juris consulti step out into the open and into the places of our advocates and instead of merely furnishing opinions to their clients represent them di rectly before the jttdex and that between them the arbiter and 279VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW lawyers thus engaged they determine their own procedure best adapted to the situation of the parties and the demands of the particular case This would be simple dignified honest concil iatory democratic as well as scientific The lawyers engaged on either side of private litigation which ought only to result where parties have a private disagreement which they are unable to settle between themselves and resort to their respective lawyers likewise fails to bring about accord and satisfaction can be re lied on to select as arbitrator from among their brethren at the bar a man of high character and of special qualifications to sit in judgment on their particular cause with far greater certitude than to look to an appointed or an elected judge serving for a term of years to try all manner of cases both public and private The procedure here suggested is one which for obvious rea sons will not become the general practice for many years to come It is submitted however with great confidence to the bar of the country It is on the men who compose the bar of our country and from whom our judges must be recruited on whom rests and must ever rest the responsibility for the respect of our people for courts and law enforcement Percy Werner ST Lauis Mo 280

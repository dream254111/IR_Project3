j100358,The School Review,1076320,The Closing of the Symposium,i244639,THE SCHOOL REVIEW on record a few years agothat any one knowing well his Latin grammar hardly need study English grammar at allbe in a way justified if we granted the assumption that the laws recording the usage of one language are applicable also to other tongues In conclusion The treatment of the Germanic tenses in the same manner is open to even more serious objections because all the tenses except the present and the preterite though probably stimulated by the completer tensesystem of the Latin were developed in Germanic times and passed through a number of changes both in form and in function which can be plainly traced in the literary monuments of the various Germanic dialects THE CLOSING OF THE SYMPOSIUM WILLIAM GARDNER HALE The University of Chicago I have been asked to close the discussion basing my remarks upon the printed abstracts of the papers which followed mine This I gladly do My prevailing feeling is one of satisfaction Five years ago I spoke upon the same subject before a body of highschool teachers of English French German Greek and Latin At the end of my talk not a voice was raised in support of my position and many were raised against it My experience in frequent conversations with individuals upon the same matter has been in general the same After I had read a paper on the subject before the American Philological Association in I909 the opposition in the discussion which followed was more vigorous than the support I was pre pared for the same results when I addressed the Modern Language Asso ciation of America in I9IO and again when I read before the Michigan Schoolmasters Club the paper with which the present symposium opened I have indicated in that paper the entirely different spirit in which the Modern Language Association appeared in its subsequent action to view the contentions put before it and I find again an entirely different spirit in the discussion at Ann Arbor There are differences of opinion in detail but in most of the abstracts the feeling seems clear that there is a large amount of identity in the syntax of the languages most commonly studied and that to the extent to which this exists we ought in the interests of teaching no less than of science to employ a uniform grammatical terminology The same feeling is likewise shown in a most important way by the realization of the hope expressed in my paper that a joint committee on the subject might be established by the leading bodies of this country con cerned in the teaching of language namely the National Education Asso 630GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 631 ciation the Modern Language Association of America and the American Philological Association Requests to this effect were sent by the two last named bodies to the first and favorably answered upon motion of Mrs Ella Flagg Young at the recent meeting in San Francisco I take this opportunity of correcting an error of date in my paper I had been told by an older member of the Modern Language Association than myself that its Committee of Fifteen upon the harmonizing of gram matical nomenclature was appointed in I9o8 On inquiring of the secre tary I learn that it was appointed at the New Haven meeting in I906 This association was thus the first to move in the direction of the study of the nomenclature of a group of languages for those who in that year were dealing with the question in France had French alone in mind It is a pity that the imposition of a second task upon this committee postponed the carryingout of the purpose for which it had been appointed Those who followed me at Ann Arbor had the advantage of me I was forced to go through a vast subject in a very brief compass1 They being furnished with copies in advance were able to supplement me when ever they wished as well as to point out where they differed They have thus among other things said much that I should like myself to have said The chief point at which I find myself in disagreement with Professor Rounds article is in his implication that we are likely to disagreethat our points of view must of necessity be so utterly different The im pression is one which I should like to dispel Now I do not know whether Professor Rounds has in mind my active occupation in comparative syntax or my being a college teacher On the first head I should say that the facts of usage upon which comparative syntax is based are the same for any given language as the facts of usage on which a grammar of that language must be based and that one who like myself insists that syntax must be an observational science will endeavor not to warp these facts On the second head I should say that I see no greater tendency toward com plexity of terminology among college teachers than among teachers in the schools In the list of grammars compiled by Professor Rounds which I cited in my paper2 the terminology of twentytwo English grammars is tabulated for certain of the commonest and simplest constructions of the noun and adjective The exhibit shows an extraordinary variety of names and in many of these a great lack of simplicity But the large majority of the authors of these grammars are teachers in schools and Professor Rounds perfectly sound contention could have been proved just as well  For a fuller though still too brief treatment see my paper in the Proceedings of the Modern Language Association of America Vol XXVI No 2 The concluding part will appear I hope within the present academic year 2Published in the Educational Review June I9goTHE SCHOOL REVIEW from this class as from the whole while the simpler names which he prefers and which I equally prefer can be found in either class I see no difference between the two in tendency But it is worth while to point out on the other hand that in the grammars of Greek and Latin in common use in this coun try all of them being by college men there is far less difference of termi nology than in our grammars of English and that the terms for four at least of the five constructions embraced in the table are in all of these Greek and Latin grammars the ones which I understand Professor Rounds to prefer As for myself personally I am aware that I have had the repu tation and justly of being an innovator and disturber but I look upon the situation with some amusemenlt since the fact is that the large majority of my new views and new terms together with details of arrangement and of style of exposition have already passed without mention of their origin and doubtless in many cases without knowledge of it into common acceptance in the Latin textbooks not only of college men but of school men Even people who will not put in their books any references to the HaleBuck Latin Grammar are yet quite ready to adopt my views my technical terms my arrangement and even my coloring of phrase Other views expressed by Professor Rounds from which I differ are the implications that the terminology of English grammar should be con sidered entirely by itself and that the report upon it should be entirely finished by February next An early ending of the present state of things is very desirable but evils so great and that have so long existed had better be cured effectively in two years than imperfectly cured for many years to come in one Professor Rounds has himself indicated even in the few points which he could mention in his brief paper that there is a great deal to be done and has touched upon matters of real difficulty I fear that some of the conclusions reached by a committee of busy men somewhat widely dispersed and forced to do most of their work by the slow method of correspondence would have to be precipitate if the whole matter were to be settled in so short a time I doubt too if the knowledge of the rapidity with which the work was done would tend to harmonize the many discordant voices of which Professor Kuersteiner justly speaks We have a great opportunity and should expend upon it real deliberation It is true that we have the report of the English committee But this report has been attacked in England and Professor Rounds himself while alluding to it with general commendation has shown that he cannot accept it in toto Further points at which I feel sure he will not accept it might be shown Thus the committee recommends that the term epithet be used to distinguish adjectives and nouns which are not predicative and explains in a note that the term has been preferred to attribute as the description of nonpredicative adjectives and nouns in order to avoid confusion with the French term attribut which is used to denote the predicative adjective 632GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 633 or noun in the official French scheme of terminology where also the term epithete is employed as above The term appears to me to be as bad for French as for English In both languages the word epithet has acquired a fixed meaning and this meaning is not the one assigned to it in the French and English reports The name recommended thus violates one of the sound principles of terminology laid down by Professor Rounds It is already clear that the whole matter will ultimately become one of international conference As I said in my paper we must not wait for this but we must be prepared for it and must be ready to exercise our own influence through having reached wellconsidered and welldefended con clusions But all this takes time As to another point I likewise am not disposed to use Professor Rounds words to strain matters in order to make a nomenclature of an inflected tongue fit the grammar of our uninflected tongue I can well believe that for some uses it will be best not to have the same terminology But every principle of function in English grammar exists in the grammars of every one of the languages taught in our schools as witness those em braced in Professor Rounds table and it is not well that the student should have to employ different names for identical principles as he passes from the study of English to the study of other languages Professor Rounds cannot afford to neglect our highschool students all of whom study some lan guage or languages besides their own Two ways of reaching harmony are possible By one of these the nomenclature which shall be adopted by the Committee of Five for English must be adopted bodily for all the other languages in which case this small committee will not be in fact as it is in name a committee upon the terminology of English grammar but a committee upon the terminology of the grammars of all the languages com monly studied in this country That does not seem to me right even though I myself having been made a member of this small committee shall have a share in this great power I cannot believe that if this way were pursued the many teachers of the other languages ancient and modern in our schools would think their interests to have been fairly considered The other way is to survey the problem as a whole Of the two ways the second seems to me clearly the right one I similarly do not feel as Professor Rounds does that our emphasis must come of course upon different phases of the problem It is true that in my paper I addressed myself especially to the syntax of the moods because I believe that there is a great deal of erroneous traditional opinion in this field But I was careful to say that the treatment of the moods would play a relatively small part in English grammar These points apart I find myself in general in strong accord with Pro fessor Rounds thinking and I look forward with pleasure to our work to gether for the common causeTHE SCHOOL REVIEW Professor Meader from experience in teaching both modern and ancient languages agrees as to the evils of the present system As to his statement that we should try to discover and describe the types of ideas conveyed by constructions that is of course our common aim This is precisely what in my brief paper I tried to do for the subjunctive and the corresponding modal auxiliaries As to the method of introspection and of the use of normal conversation in our own vernacular I likewise employ it noticing what I mean by what I say and frequently asking my interlocutor to tell me just what he meant by something that he has said But when I wish to lay my results before others these facts even if I have noted them down as I often do both from conversation and from letters received will have no more validity than any other printed material of a corresponding class and might be received with less confidence than the examples of the ver nacular which I have cited from President Taft and Mr Walter Camp and the editorials or news reports of our daily papers and even from careful writers in the ordinary interchange of opinion To put the matter to im mediate test I recognize that I use the word should besides other uses now to express the idea of obligation propriety or reasonableness and now to express the idea of natural likelihood or probability and this has a bearing upon an important problem I find that others employ the same word in the same way But when I have occasion to make use of these facts in an address or paper it would be much more troublesome to quote my per sonal experiences and certainly not more effective than it would be to call attention to the fact that in his abstract printed above Professor Meader has himself used the word to express obligation We should approach  and The material with which we work should be primarily contemporary experience in normal conversation in our own vernacular and has used the same word also to express natural likelihood or probability as in They should form a thoroughly sound foundation In his last paragraph in the statement I have usually been better satis fied with the student who could describe a function than with one who could merely name it Professor Meader hints at a pedagogic principle com monly overlooked but of the utmost importance I hope that this and other important and littlerecognized principles will be discussed in print in the coming winter in notable papers which I have seen in manuscript by Mr Mason D Gray of the East High School Rochester NY Profesor Kuersteiners general support of the position of my paper gives me satisfaction I can understand too how the warning which he utters may occur to any careful thinker It is conveyed in these words A scholar interested in syntax is anxious of course to reach generalizations that may be as broad as possible Now the broader a generalization the more difficult it is to understand Thus Professor Hale may be right in classifying the subjunctive after verbs of fearing as he does but it is extremely doubtful whether a highschool pupil could grasp his classification 634GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 635 And later A multiplicity of small generalizations is better than a few broad ones I wish that I could speak at length on this text but I must only answer briefly as follows There is danger in anxiety to reach broad generalization We have certain generalizations in current use today which to my mind are harm ful not because they are broad but because they have obliterated clear actual differences in the phenomena put together For myself I endeavor not to be anxious to reach any particular result but to observe and to try to detect first of all functions What actual function do I find for example to be expressed by this particular use of the subjunctive before me what by this and what by this I reach in this way in most casesnot in all the same conclusions that others have reached I find the Latin subjunc tive for example to be used in the expression of exhortation of result of command of concession of a certain kind of deliberation of a condition of a certain kind of a conclusion of a certain kind in substantive clauses after verbs of certain kinds and after nouns and adjectives of certain kinds and so on In each case I try to make out precisely what the moodfeeling in the speakers mind is It seems to me that in exhortation he wants others to join with him in doing that which the verb denotes in prohibition in which of course there is a negative particle that he wants the person addressed not to do that which the verb denotes in command that he wants the act denoted to be performed I really find then not three different attitudes of mind in the three constructions but one attitude of mind the difference being wholly one of the person or of the presence or absence of a negative Here is a generalization but it is easy and is helpful In show ing the force in question to my pupils or to my readers I use the homely word want as well as the less homely word will To get a technical name for the attitude of mind I am brought to make the term subjunctive of volition which is by no means bad since subjunctive of willing or subjunctive of wanting seems unsatisfactory I also make the word volitive in order to have an adjective at hand in the interests of brevity in classroom work Now I have shown elsewhere that the Latin clause of purpose is pretty surely of volitive origin and feeling corresponding to the English occasional shallclause of purpose of which I gave an example from exPresident Roosevelt I therefore put the Latin clause of purpose into the chapter headed Uses of the Volitive Subjunctive This generali zation does not add to the childs task it lessens his task Again I find reason to believe that the Latin clause of fear from which the French clause of fear is derived began in a combination of an expression of anxiety and an independent expression of the idea that the speaker wants something to happen volitive or wants something not to happen volitive with a negative3 as I said in the longer form of my paper sent out in advance 3 My predecessors had either explained the use of ut and ne mechanically or had treated it as a development from the idea of wishing The difference between this last explanation and mine is of course not large but it is as well to be right as to be nearly rightTHE SCHOOL REVIEW to those who were to follow me at Ann Arbor I therefore put the con struction under the general head of the volitive in the syntax of the HaleBuck Grammar I have received letters from several highschool teachers tell ing me that it was a relief to them to be able now to explain intelligibly to their pupils this apparently selfcontradictory construction which they had hitherto had to explain in ways that neither they nor the class under stood This is the explanation of which Professor Kuersteiner says that it is extremely doubtful whether a highschool pupil could grasp my classi fication But there is better evidence even than this In the Hale Latin Prose Composition Book I Based on Caesar the rule is given as follows Fear is expressed by a subjunctive clause with ne representing the act as not wanted or with ut representing it as wanted English uses lest or that where Latin uses ne and lest not or that not where Latin uses ut A note intended to remove a common4 and to the student most con fusing impression adds Bear in mind that English and Latin get at the expression of the idea from entirely different points of view Ne of course does not mean that and ut does not mean that not We are simply forced to translate according to our own idiom This use of the homely and easily intelligible word want to describe the attitude of mind was by the way new in print Now Professor B L DOoge of the State Normal College at Ypsilanti Mich a practised teacher and teacher of teachers and author of various textbooks says in his recent Latin for Beginners  370 We have learned that what we want done or not done is expressed in Latin by a subjunctive clause of purpose In this class belongs also clauses after verbs of fearing for we fear either that something will happen or that it will not and we either want it to happen or we do not If we want a thing to happen and fear that it will not the purpose5 clause is introduced by ut If we do not want it to happen and fear that it will ne is used Owing to a difference between the English and Latin idiom we translate ut after a verb of fearing by that not and ne by that or lest I must conclude then that my classification and my form of statement of the construction including the use of the word want seems to Pro fessor DOoge to promise to be more easily not less easily understood in the schools than those of my predecessors See also what is said later about the treatment of the ablative of the agent with a or ab 4 Cf the statement in Professor Bennetts Latin Grammar  296 under the heading Sub stantive Clauses Developed from the Optative Here belong clauses  with verbs of fearing timeo metuo vereor Here ne means that lest and ut means that not I do not like this phrase The clause never was a clause of purpose But this way of representing it belongs to the nomenclature of Professor Greenoughs school of syntax to which Professor DOoge is in the main attached 636GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 637 I also differ from Professor Kuersteiner at the following sentences The desire on the part of teachers and textbookmakers to make instruction in Latin an exercise in classification has been the bane of our highschool work It has also been and is the refuge of the teacher who does not know enough of the language to lead pupils on to a ready understanding of the foreign text Of course the harder the generalization is for the pupil the more time the in competent teacher can devote to it The fact in general seems to me to be the opposite It is not the broader generalizations which would give a sense of unity that the teacher spends time upon it is the narrower generalizationsexhortation clause of purpose clause after a verb of commanding etcon which time is spent as indeed it must be until the student quickly recognizes the forces of these common constructions But the very defect of this teaching which is the result of the conceptions and form of exposition of the textbooks lies in the fact that these constructions are all looked upon as utterly separate and unrelated things instead of being looked upon and presented as merely uses to which a few easily recognized forces of the subjunctive are put Thus in my experience students and in my teachers training courses teachers are both helped and interested when it is shown them that the subjunctive in the force in which it expresses what someone wants is used to convey the ideas of exhortation command prohibition purpose and in clauses depend ing upon verbs nouns or adjectives involving the idea of wanting and that in an imaginative sense it is also used just like the English imperative or the infinitive with let thusI am well aware that I am the umblest person going said Uriah Heep modestly let the other be where he may Dickens David Copperfield Chap xvi in expressing the ideas of concession and of proviso and sometimes in expressing a condition in independent form Not only this but the student actually learns the construction at the beginning more readily and easily if he is told this and shown that the same uses of the same force are more or less familiar in English Similarly he learns the construction of the ablative absolute the more easily if he is told as can be proved that the construction is in origin only one use of the withpower of the ablative with which he is by this time well ac quainted and that if he will watch what he hears and reads in English he will find abundant illustrations of the same thing as in with telephone and telegraph service crippled and more than 300 miles of railroad out of commission only meager reports are being received from the floodswept districts from the Chicago Evening Post October Io But I must add that one cause of the ineffectiveness of the teaching of syntax in our schools is the fact that a considerable number of the nar rower generalizations about common constructions are not sound and the student is therefore obliged to give names of which he certainly ought not to see the application Such things lead to purely mechanical conceptions ofTHE SCHOOL REVIEW the nature of syntax The teacher too has to force his explanation and change it if he changes his series of textbooks Thus if he uses Bennetts Caesar he must explain quare timeret in I xiv as a clause of purpose if the Allen  Greenough Caesar as a clause of characteristic if the HarknessForbes Caesar as a potential subjunctive in a relative clause if the TowlesJenks Caesar as a clause of purpose while the exactly cor responding quare animadverteret of Ixix has to be explained by users of the lastnamed book as an indirect question6 And all these two thou sand years Caesar himself has been ready to teach anyone who will observe that his meaning was that of obligation or propriety for he has balanced against quare timeret the form timendum which can have no other meaning It isnt too much science that makes the teaching of syntax hard in our schools it is too much blind and false science With regard to the results of Professor Wagners questions put to his students in Spanish my explanation would be as follows I did not mean that every additional language he the student learns adds to his confusion no matter whether he is forced to learn different ex planations for identical conceptions or not A good many teachers fortunately make little use of the theories of interrelationship which most of the books contain The students uncon scious linguistic feeling grows with the extension of his range of languages Left to himself as to theories he will not be confused by things which are alike but quite the contrary By the time he reaches the comparatively ad vanced stages at which the study of Spanish is ordinarily taken up he has very probably even forgotten the generalizations which he may perhaps have been forced to learn some years before for other languages But if on the other hand the student is obliged to learn and keep up generalizations for the languages which he studies I am certain that Professor Wagner must agree with me that it is harder to learn for identical conceptions a different explanation for each language than to learn one explanation for all and this is what the experience of the four students he mentions points to But I should have to differ from him as to the proportion of grammars and other manuals that make the general explanations of which I spoke in my paper From Professor Scotts very admirably expressed description of the probable earlier stages of language I do not differ essentially as he himself has intimated And I like very much his statement that the aim of a ver nacular grammar is to rationalize for the student something that he already knows as likewise the image which he employs of a map of the 6 For a brief exhibit without comment of these discordances as well as of agreements see in the Hale Latin Prose Composition the appendix for the teacher entitled  Correspondences and Differences in Terminology and Treatment in the Five Grammars Cited and the Editions of Caesar in Common Use 638GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 639 town or township in which the student lives The whole paragraph upon this head is most instructive and helpful It is true also that when the student approaches a foreign language he has everything to learn But I believe at the same time that we may teach foreign languages in such a way that the student will not have to take everything on trust but may be led to observe and to see for him self that the statements made conform to his observation if they are true The process is not to be sure a rationalization of that which he already knows but the result in his consciousness if the work is done in this way and is sound will equally be a rational system precisely as it is in the study of physics in which the student is always carried far beyond that which he knew at the outset Thus if a highschool boy has a substantive utclause depending upon volo I want put before him he can easily see that the utclause expresses that which is wanted in other words that the at titude of mind is that which I have called volitive Similarly if he is shown a substantive utclause depending upon exspecto I expect I wait for he will easily see that the attitude of expectation of antici pation or whatever we find it on the whole best to call it is in the mood of the dependent clause as well as in the inherent meaning of the main verb Moreover as I have said actual study has brought me to believewhat is in itself also antecedently extremely probablethat the grammatical ideas which we ourselves are constantly hearing and expressing in the vernacular are not ideas of Englishspeaking people alone but are ideas which people have in France in Germany in Italy in Spain and which people had in Rome when Latin was spoken and in Greece when ancient Greek was spoken Even if the methods of expressing these ideas are different in these different countries the ideas are in the main the same or at any rate essentially the same and the names for them should therefore be the same in the respective grammars Even so much should be a great gain But actual study has also brought me to believe that to a very considerable extent the methods of expression of these ideas are actually identical in the various languages that in a word the human mind has worked largely in the same way in the different branches of our great bloodfamily And even the deflections from what appear to be the ways of the common inheritance seem to me to show in most cases a remarkable amount of similarity I hope accordingly for a treatment of grammars which will inculcate the same conceptions by the use of the same names and the same explanations for all these languages so far as things are the same and will use different explanations and different names to the extent only to which things are different Such a treatment will not in the least tend to obscure the actually existing dissimilarities it will tend to bring them into stronger relief And finally so far as regards this particular matter I am now convincedTHE SCHOOL REVIEW that in the study of a foreign language we should start with the correspond ing phenomena of English so far as there is correspondence7 I have always made much of English syntax in my syntactical seminary and in my training courses for teachers I have done so to some extent in my Latin books for school use but momentarily deterred by the difficulty of space I have not done it as much as I shall do it in the revision of them To illustrate In the syntax of the HaleBuck Grammar in treating of the Latin expression of the idea of the agent by the ablative with a or ab I compared There was a man sent from God John i 6 and in my First Latin Book I compared an arrow shot from a wellexperienced archer after making the statement The meaning of the Latin construction was originally from the conception being that of the person from whom the action started Professor DOoge in the book mentioned above finds it profitable to work my phrase into his rule which reads I8I the word expressing the person from whom an action starts when not the sub ject is put in the ablative with the preposition a or ab This is well but I think the users of his book would grasp the idea still more easily and surely if he had given them an English example of the same conception though this is one of the places where the ordinary English conception does not correspond with the Latin one In treating the Latin subjunc tive I did not begin in my books with the English subjunctive but I shall do so in revisions Thus such an expression as Everybody watch his man which I overheard yesterday from a captain on the football field such sentences as Walter Camps It is essential that the West and the East be in sympathy the Boston Advertisers The government asked that this organization be dissolved and Longfellows But to act that each tomorrow find us further than today would form a helpful as well as scientifically sound introduction to the treatment of the Latin subjunctive Of course many of the things which the grammars of foreign languages have to treat are not treated in elementary English grammars at all and should not be The student does not need to be told them in order to under stand what he reads and has enough to do in mastering the first principles without them But when these necessary things are taken up in the study of other languages the startingpoint for the conveying of the ideas should so far as possible be in the vernacular With the principle laid down by Professor Scott for the choice of grammatical terms I am fully in sympathy Nor is there any real difference between us with regard to metaphysical theories in grammar I believe that the ultimate system of metaphysics and the ultimate system of grammar must of course be in harmony But I am sure that neither of us believes that the way to make a grammar now is to adopt the system of some meta physicianAristotle or Descartes or Wolff or Kant or Hegeland en deavor to cast the constructions which we find into its mold 7 On this point also see the expected papers by Mr Gray 640GRAMMATICAL NOMENCLATURE IN LANGUAGESTUDY 641 Professor Diekhoffs paper contains besides its courteous opening much interesting critical matter which I should gladly discuss But a part of the discussion and that the most important part namely with regard to the use of the Germanic optative after words meaning before and until would require a detailed treatment of a large number of examples and demand much more space than would be reasonable here The present paper has also doubtless reached the limit of patience of the readers of the symposium I must therefore reserve the discussion for some technical journal touch ing here upon only three points First I have repeatedly said that I am ready for any conclusion being as anxious to recognize the differences among languages as I am to recog nize the identities though the evidence so far as I know it does not bring me to agree with Professor Diekhoff Second the general method of Professor Diekhoffs procedure in the examination of the Germanic optative with words meaning before or until is sound and the results upon his exhibition of the facts seem weighty In the time at my command I can control the evidence from Gothic only Here I do not find the facts to be exactly reported When he says that faurthizei before a comparative form is the only one of all the temporal conjunctions followed by the subjunctive he doubtless means the only one that is always followed by the subjunctive and this is true But the next statement is too strong It reads und thatei until as long as is usually and unte with the same meaning     is almost in every case followed by the indicative Now I find six cases of und thatei four in the indicative and two in the subjunctive For unte I find twentytwo cases sixteen in the indicative and six in the subjunctive But certain subtractions have also to be made from the indicative examples for types which under no theory could be in any other mood as eg in followed him  until he came to the palace of the high priest and I must work  while it is day With these removed we have the following proportions for und thatei two indicatives and two subjunctives for unte twelve in dicatives and six subjunctives The nine examples with faurthizei before are all in the subjunctive An individual examination of them reduces the number that have a bearing But I waive this point for the present and I also grant that in Old and Middle High and Low German the moodusage seems as the special treatises say to be approximately the same in before clauses and clauses after a comparative Yet all the while the striking fact confronts us that our earliest surviving Germanic monument Gothic in spite of its short compass actually possesses twelve examples in independent sentences of that very force the anticipatory which I invoke to explain the origin of the subjunctive clauses with before and until particles which by their very nature seem adapted to set up the idea of futurity and to explain the forceTHE SCHOOL REVIEW of the mood in the occasional modern use But it is quite possible that the peculiar Germanic habit of using a subjunctive after a comparative after it had once arisen may for a while have helped to keep the mood steady or even have brought about a different feeling for it That habit which looks like a highly derivative one was pretty surely not of early origin and certainly does not exist in modern Germanic On the other hand Professor Diekhoffs explanation of the subjunctive after bis bevor and ehe in the modern period as expressing an act wished for would fail for the majority of cases for example for Luthers der Hahn wird nicht krahen bis du mich drei Mal habest verleugnet John 13 38 Finally I wish to disclaim Professor Diekhoffs apparent opinion that Brugmanns system and mine are substantially the same Brugmann him self has expressly said at one point that they are not8 and still more important ones remain There are essential differences both in the broad lines and in method A typical example of the latter sort may be seen in the printed abstract of a paper which I gave before the Versamimlung deut scher Professoren und Schulmiinner in Basel in I907 and in which I dealt also with the method of Delbriick and Behaghel in the same field For the former it is my misfortune that for the cases as well as for the moods I have had time to set forth longheld views only in very brief and inadequate form as in abstracts entitled Leading MoodForces in the IndoEuropean Parent Speech and Leading CaseForces in the IndoEuropean Parent Speech in the Proceedings of the American Philological Association Vol XXXII 90oI s Griech Grammatik  554 Anmerkung Die Ausdriicke volitiv und prospektiv sind von Hale The Anticipatory Subjunctive in Greek and

anticipatory use but in the volitive for which the negative is ux as it is not for the anticipatory The deliberative is simply a volitive question compare ud twuev let us not go and l towev  shall we

matter of evaporation which some may think hardly applies to snow I will say that a considerable body has been known to dis appear from our streets without making a particle of mud leaving the ground dusty showing that none of it melted but that it all went directly into the air And this will occur any time when the thermometer does not go above 32 degrees within a short time after a storm The importance of pre senting as small a surface to the action of such an air as that is very apparent and it is in storing up the snow in heaps and packing it away in deep pockets that the economy of nature is manifested The center of the body will not melt at any time and it requires a very warm day to get at the under side of a snow drift The grass will be growing all around it before the ground underneath it gets warmed up sufficiently to start a stream from it but let a tree stick its head up through the crust and it will go quickly I have yet to see the first body of perpetual snow lying among trees It will hardly do to say that the timber lies below the line of per petual snow for there are many banks which only disappear entirely once in ten years or so when there comes a long dry summer which have trees growing higher up on the same mountain side In any case I do not wish to be under stood as favoring the destruction of the forests of this or any other country I never cut down a tree in my life and never saw one fall without feeling that I had lost a friend Whatever is proven there will always be abundant reasons for preserving extensive tracts of woodland everywhere that trees will grow and it is tilme the mat ter became one of public concern R L FULTON IRENO NEVADA CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY THE QUESTION OF THE CELTS THIS question has broken out afresh in Europe as is the case every few years The immediate cause was the publication of an essay by A Bertrand and Salomon Reinach entitled Les celtes dans les Vallees du Po et du Danube in which the authors claim that the protohistoric culture the remains of which are found in the valley of the Po is akin to that of an approximate age in the valley of the Danube and that both were the products of the Celts Prof Virchow in a lecture published in the CorrespondenzBlatt of the German Anthropological Society December 1895 reviewed their arguments substantially agreed with them and further extended the area of this socalled Celtic culture By Celts the archaeologists understand a series of independent tribes who about 5001000 B C inhabited central and por tions of western Europe Their language was of that Aryan family which we now know as Celtic represented today by Irish Highland Scotch and Welsh In stature they were tall their skulls narrow doli chocephalic their complexion ruddy eyes blue or gray hair blonde or reddish By the Latins they were called Celti Galli or Galatse all three words from the same root kel meaning violent or warlike The anthropologists however headed by Broca apply the term Celts to a small dark race in central France and this leads to wild confusion A long discussion aimed to clear up the subject by Dr Le fevre Dr Collignon Mortillet and others has appeared in the Bull de la Soci6te d Anthropologie of Paris 1895 It is worth attentive reading by any one who desires the latest on this vexed question DANISH ANTIQUITIES PROFESSOR JAPETUS STEENSTRUP of Co penhagen has lately issued two memoirs of 552 SCIENCESCIENCE much interest to students of Northern an tiquities both published in the  Memoires de lAcademie Royale des Sciences de Danemark One is a discussion of the remarkable so called silver vase exhumed in 1891 at Gundestrup Upon its sides were numer ous singular figures in relief and it has generally passed as an example of old Norse work This view is disproved by Professor Steenstrup who shows that without doubt it is part of a series of decorations from some Buddhist temple in northern Asia His memoir is abundantly supplied with plates and illustrations showing the iden tity of motives It probably was a part of the spoils of some ancient raid which by exchange had reached the western shore of the continent His second memoir is another study of a similar character bringing out the rela tions which in protohistoric times existed between Scandinavia and northern Asia It is entitled YakLungta Bracteaterne and contains numerous illustrations of gold bracteates from the two regions showing the same character of design and work manship D G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS ASTRONOMY THE February number of the Monthly No tices of the Royal Astronomical Society copies of which have just been received contains the annual reports of the directors of the British observatories for the year 1895 Many of these reports are very interesting and they show that the customary astronomical activity has not de creased The routine meridian observations and those of comets etc have been carried on with the usual success Nearly all the plates for the astrophotographic catalogue and some of those for the chart have been taken at the Greenwich Cape Oxford and Sydney observa tories The work of measurement has also made 553 quite satisfactory progress We quote the fol lowing from the Greenwich report Towards the determination of the right ascensions and declinations of the stars the fol lowing steps have been taken From the right ascensions and declinations given in the cata logues of the Astronomische Gesellschaft  stand ard co6rdinates have been deduced for all stars on 72 plates which are contained in these catalogues By standard coordinates are meant the rectangular co6rdinates of the stars on the plates By a comparison of these with the measured co6rdinates plate constants have been determined from which the standard co ordinates of other stars on the plates may be obtained by means of a linear correction and the right ascensions and declinations deduced by a trigonometrical transformation if desired A full account of this as well as the comparison of thirty overlapping plates is given in the Monthly Notices January 1896 The above shows that the reduction of the catalogue plates is well under way at Green wich The same is true at Oxford and as we mentioned in a previous issue it is also pro ceeding satisfactorily at Paris and Potsdam At the Cape considerable measuring has also been done But the most important announcement from the Cape is as follows  The printing in two volumes of A Deter mination of the Solar Parallax and the Mass of the Moon from Observations of Iris Victoria and Sappho is approaching completion The part of the work referring to the meridian ob servations of the comparison stars is by Prof Auwers that of the discussion of the heliometer observations of Iris by Dr Elkin We have not space to refer to the many de tails given in the reports of the various observa tories But they are all interesting and will repay perusal by astronomers The Societys medal was conferred upon Dr S C Chandler of Cambridge Mass as has already been an nounced in this journal THE Astronomical Journal of March 31st con tains an article by Prof Simon Newcomb on the Variation of Personal Equation with the Magni tude of the Star Observed This is the first attempt to make a general discussion of this rather obscure point for a large number of star APRIL 10 1896

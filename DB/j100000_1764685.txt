plunge directly into the vortex of the AT the meeting of the Institute of Electrical Engineers held on hurricane May 22 Mr W H Peirce read a paper under the title  Relation Brief rules for action are the following Watch carefully for the between the Initial and Average Efficiency of Incandescent Elec earliest indications recording observations of barometer ther tric Lamps which gave the results of experiments made by mometers wind and weather for future reference When there is him for the Chicago Burlington and Quincy Railroad Four436 SCIENCE makes of lamps were used in the tests their candlepower and effi ciency being determined at intervals  during a working period of 850 hours There were fifteen commercial lamps of each make at first but afterwards some additional lamps were sent from the fac tories The methods of tests used were calculated to give accurate results and much care was taken in the measurements there being frequent comparisons of both current and potential measuring instruments with standards while the Methuen burner used in determining the candlepower was compared with standard candles and found to be practically correct The results of the measurements can hardly be regarded as flattering to incandescentlamp manufactures The initial efficiency of the lamps varied from about 3 watts to the candlepower about fifteen i6candlepower lamps to the electrical horsepower to 5 watts to the candlepower nine lamps to the horsepower As time went on however the lamps from the blackening of the globes and the increased resistance of the filaments grew dimmer until the candlepower had gone down in some cases to six or eight candles while the efficiency had decreased until in some cases lamps which gave a candlelight with an expenditure of 3 watts finally required 7 watts to give the same light The highest aver age efficiency for any make of lamps for 800 hours was 458 watts the lowest 58 watts per candlepower Probably the most satis factory of the lamps experimented on had an average efficiency of about 48 watts the final candlepower after 900 hours service being about I4 the initial being I6 candles An important point brought out in these tests is the marked de crease in the candlepower of commercial lamps even after a mod erate service It is not at all satisfactory to consumers to have the lamp gradually decrease in brightness until it finally does not give enough light to read by and to this cause may doubtless be attributed the comparatively slow introduction of the light If the musers are to replace the lamps it is hardly in human nature to do so until they are broken and a life of 2000 or 3000 hours is not uncommon At the end of that time a I6candle lamp is giving about six candles and that at a very low efficiency There are smany electriclight companies that guarantee twelve I6candle tamps to the mechanical horsepower equivalent to an efficiency of the lamp of about 3 watts to the candle It is possible that a plant might give such results for a few hours but if these tests are to be trusted none of the lamps in extended commercial use can do better than a candlepower for 48 watts with the light at the end of 900 hours having 85 per cent of its initial brilliancy The practical life of the lamp then is limited by two things  the breaking of the filament and the decrease of candlepower This latter has not been recognized as it should have been and Mr Peirces paper is of value in calling attention to it INHERENT DEFECTS OF LEAD SECONDARY BATTERIES  A paper under this title was read at the meeting of the Institute of Electrical Engineers by Dr Louis Duncan It consisted mainly of a description of and deductions from a series of experiments which had been carried on by himself and Mr Henry Wiegand during the past year the principal points investigated being the loss of energy in charging and discharging such cells with the causes of their deterioration The cells experimented on were of the  grid  type in which the active materials  peroxide of lead and spongy leadare pasted into hourglassshaped cavities in a castlead  grid This type is the one almost universally used in commer cial work and it has so far been the most successful The defects of these batteries lie i in the limited storage capacity it being but oneeighth of the calculated value 2 in the loss of energy in charge and discharge 3 in the deterioration 4 in the low dis charge rate allowed by considerations of efficiency and length of life The loss of energy exhibits itself by two effects a lower potential difference on discharge than on charge and a loss in ampere hours between charge and discharge The loss of energy must be traced to two things  the production of heat or the formation of irreversible chemical products It is known that the electromotive force of a secondary battery is greater as the strength of the acid increases When the strength is greatly diminished there is a formation of irreversible sulphates of lead and a rapid corrosion of the plates It is also known that discharge of the cell consists in a sulphating of both plates causing a weakening of the VOL XIII No 33I acid charge results in desulphating strengthening the acid In the plugs of active material where diffusion is slow there must be considerable differences of density in the acid between charge and discharge this being especially the case when the current rate is considerable We can consider then that the charge is in strong acid the discharge in weak To these considerations correspond the facts that the electromotive force is higher on charge than discharge that a rapid discharge lowers the electromotive force which however rises again after a period of repose and that a rapid discharge causes a deterioration of the plates To see if there were any ground for these suppositions experiments were made on the rate of diffusion of acid from the plates and it was found to be slow especially with partly rundown plates this cor responding to the fact that fully charged plates can be discharged more rapidly than partly discharged ones To fix the losses of energy which result in heat effects a cell was discharged in a calorimeter and the rise of temperature and other data observed under various circumstances The first thing that appeared was that there was a much greater heating during charge than during discharge there being sometimes an absolute fall of temperature in the latter case when the C2R effect was allowed for This is partly due to the weakening and strengthening of the acid in the solution there being of course a corresponding absorption or pro duction of heat Every one who has mixed acid and water is aware of the latter fact Again on charging or discharging for short periods allowing the cell to stand idle for the same length of time it was observed that the temperature continued to rise after the current had stopped This was accounted for by supposing that the distribution of current in the plugs not being uniform different parts of the same plug would be in different chemical states and local currents would be produced tending to make the plug uniform These local currents cause losses which exhibit themselves finally as heat The principal cause of loss however seems to be due to the electrolysis of the solution the loss from this cause appearing as heat and in the liberation of oxygen and hydrogen from the two plates The other losses are mainly due to the formation of irreversible products in the form of lead salts In one discharge and charge cited the total loss was 98 watt hours Of these 51 watts were accounted for in heat the remainder must have been due to irreversible chemical actions The heat losses may be classed as i the Joule effect measured by C2R 2 heat ing due to eddycurrents 3 heating due to electrolysis of the solution into free hydrogen and oxygen It should be noted that the alternate heating and cooling due to the strengthening and weakening of the acid is reversible and therefore does not appear as a loss Of the losses due to chemical actions during charge which are not reversed on discharge the most important as far as loss of energy goes is the electrolysis of the solution into free hydrogen and oxygen The most important so far as deteriora tion goes is the formation of salts of lead on discharge in the weak acid in the plug from the material of the supportplate This last effect is exaggerated by rapid discharge or by discharging until the formation of the more bulky sulphate of lead has greatly de creased the diffusion HEALTH MATTERS WOMENS BREATHING  Our readers will doubtless remember the claim made by Dr Thomas J Mays of Philadelphia that he had succeeded in demonstrating that the statement made in almost every textbook on physiology that it was natural for women to breathe from the chest was wrong that the abdominal type of res piration as ordinarily observed in men was the natural type of women as well and the costal type as seen in women is the result of modern dress This claim he supported by the result of an ex amination of eightytwo American Indian girls Dr J H Kellogg from an examination of Chinese and other women untrammelled by tightfitting dress finds the abdominal type present in them Other observers notably Hutchinson in twentyfour girls whose waists had never been constricted by corsets or other appliances found the costal type present The question of what is the natural type of respiration may therefore still be regarded as sub judice unless which perhaps may be the truth both types are natural under varying conditions independent of dress

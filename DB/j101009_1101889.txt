SHALL BE ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND THAT NO SPECIAL ACT SHALL BE PASSED IN RELATION THERETO EXCEPT IN THE MANNER PRESCRIBED IN ARTICLE 4 OF THE CON STITUTION WHAT SPECIAL ACTS MAY BE PASSED IN RELATION TO CITIES AND TOWNS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION VA CODE 1904 P CCXVII NEED NOT NOW BE CONSIDERED FOR IT IS CLEAR THAT CITIES AND TOWNS NOT IN EXISTENCE WHEN THE CONSTITUTION WENT

FOR THE ORGANIZATION OF CITIES AND TOWNS SHALL BE ENACTED AND THAT NO SPECIAL ACT SHALL BE PASSED IN RELATION THERETO IS SECOND TO NO OTHER PROVISION OF THE CON STITUTION IN VALUE AND IMPORTANCE AND CANNOT BE TOO CAREFULLY OBSERVED OR STRICTLY ENFORCED OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN AS FORMERLY GRANT CHARTERS CREATING CITIES AND TOWNS BUT WHEN SUCH CHARTERS ARE GRANTED THE CITY OR TOWN SO CHARTERED MUST BE ORGANIZED AND GOVERNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL LAWS OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE OB NOXIOUS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FORBIDDING SPECIAL LEGISLA TION THE CHARTER OF THE TOWN OF MADISON HEIGHTS AS SET FORTH IN THE ACT OF MARCH 14 1904 IS OBNOXIOUS IN NUMEROUS PARTICULARS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL INHIBITION AGAINST SPECIAL LEGISLATION IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO POINT OUT IN THIS OPINION ALL OF THE MATERIAL RESPECTS IN WHICH THE POWERS SOUGHT TO BE CONFERRED BY THE ACT IN QUESTION DIFFER FROM THE POWERS CONFERRED UPON TOWNS BY THE EXISTING GENERAL LAW ONE OR TWO EXAMPLES MAY BE MENTIONED CLAUSE 20 OF THE ACT PROVIDES THAT THE ELECTION OF MAYOR AND COUNCILMEN OF MADISON HEIGHTS SHALL BE ON THE FIRST TUESDAY IN JUNE 1904 AND EVERY TWO YEARS THEREAFTER WHEREAS UNDER THE

POWERS AND AU THORITY OF A CONSTABLE AND CONSERVATOR OF THE PEACE WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS AND FOR A DISTANCE OF 14 MILES BEYOND WHEREAS AS ALREADY POINTED OUT THE JURISDICTION OF THE CORPORATE AUTHOR ITIES OF A TOWN IS LIMITED BY THE GENERAL LAW TO 1 MILE BEYOND THE CORPORATE LIMITS WITHOUT FURTHER DETAIL IT MAY BE SAID THAT MOST OF THE IM PORTANT PROVISIONS OF THE ACT INCORPORATING THE TOWN OF MADISON HEIGHTS ARE EITHER IN CONFLICT WITH THE EXISTING GENERAL LAW OR WITHOUT ANY GENERAL LAW TO SUPPORT THEM THE FACT HOWEVER THAT NO GENERAL LAW ON THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN PASSED DOES NOT AFFECT THE QUESTION SECTION 117 IS SELFEXECUTING SO FAR AS IT PROHIBITS SPECIAL LEGISLATION AND ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT IT AMENDS THE CHARTERS OF TOWNS AND CITIES SO AS TO MAKE THEM CONFORM TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION HICKS V CITY OF BRISTOL 102 VA 861 47 S E 1001 IT WOULD SEEM FROM CLAUSE 19 OF THE ACT THAT THE DRAFTSMAN OF THE CHARTER INTENDED TO CONFER SPECIAL AUTHORITY AND POWER IT BEING THERE PROVIDED THAT IN ADDITION TO THE SPECIAL POWERS HEREINBEFORE ESPECIALLY DELEGATED TO THE TOWN COUNCIL ALL GENERAL POWERS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAWS OF THIS STATE OR OF THE UNITED STATES NECESSARY FOR THE PROPER GOVERNMENT OF SAID TOWN AND WHICH ARE BY LAW ALLOWED TO MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS ARE HEREBY LIKEWISE DELEGATED AND VESTED IN THE SAID TOWN COUNCIL IF HOWEVER THE LEGISLATURE HAD POSSESSED THE POWER TO PASS A SPECIAL ACT FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF A TOWN THE CHARTER IN THE CASE AT BAR WOULD STILL BE INVALID BECAUSE IT EX EMPTS THE PERSONS RESIDING WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE PROPOSED TOWN FROM THE PAYMENT OF CERTAIN TAXES TO THE COUNTY OF AMHERST IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 168 ART 13 OF THE CONSTITU TION VA CODE 1904 P CCLXII WHICH EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT ALL TAXES SHALL BE UNIFORM UPON THE SAME CLASS OF SUBJECTS WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE AUTHORITY LEVYING THE TAX AND SHALL BE LEVIED AND COLLECTED UNDER GENERAL LAWS THIS COURT HAS HELD THAT A TOWN IS A PART OF THE COUNTY FOR ALL PURPOSES OF TAXATION AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS NO POWER BY REASON OF THE CON STITUTIONAL INHIBITION MENTIONED TO EXEMPT THE TAXABLE PERSONS 1906 99711 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER AND PROPERTY IN A TOWN SITUATED WITHIN THE LIMITS OF A COUNTY AND FORMING A PART THEREOF FROM COUNTY LEVIES THAT A PART OF A COUNTY CANNOT BE MADE TO BEAR ALL THE BURDEN OF TAXATION FOR COUNTY PURPOSES AND THAT THE UNIFORMITY REQUIRED EXTENDS NOT ONLY TO THE RATE AND MODE OF ASSESSMENT BUT ALSO TO THE TERRITORY TO BE ASSESSED AND WHEN A TAX IS LEVIED BY A COUNTY IT MUST BE UNIFORM THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY DAY V ROBERTS 101 VA 248 43 S E 362 IN THE CASE CITED THE COURT WAS CONSTRUING A SIMILAR PROVISION IN THE CONSTITUTION OF 1869 THE PROVISION IN THE PRESENT CON STITUTION IS POSSIBLY MORE EXPLICIT IN PROVIDING THAT TAXATION SHALL BE UNIFORM WITHIN THE TERRITORIAL LIMITS OF THE AUTHORITY LEVYING THE TAX THAN THAT CONSTRUED IN DAY V ROBERTS THIS BEING SO THE COUNTY OF AMHERST CAN AND MUST LEVY THE SAME TAXES UPON THE PEOPLE AND PROPERTY OF MADISON HEIGHTS AS UPON THE REST OF THE COUNTY THE PROVISION OF THE CHARTER EXEMPTING THE PEOPLE OF THAT TOWN FROM THE TAXES MENTIONED IS THEREFORE WHOLLY NUG ATORY THIS PROVISION FOR EXEMPTION FROM TAXES CANNOT BE HELD INVALID AND THE RESIDUE OF THE ACT BE PERMITTED TO STAND UNAFFECTED BV THE ILLEGAL SECTION AS WAS DONE IN THE CASE OF CAHOON V IRON GATE SUPRA BECAUSE TO ESCAPE THE PAYMENT OF SUCH TAXES WAS ONE OF THE CHIEF INDUCEMENTS HELD OUT BY THE CHARTER TO GET THE TAXPAYERS OF THE PROPOSED TOWN TO VOTE FOR THE CHARTER WHEN IT WAS SUBMITTED TO THEM FOR THEIR APPROVAL OR REJECTION AND WE CANNOT SAY THAT THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE VOTED FOR THE CHARTER IF THAT PROVISION HAD BEEN OMITTED IN SUCH A CASE THE WHOLE CHAR TER MUST BE HELD INVALID ROBERTSON V PRESTON 97 VA 296 301 33 S E 618 IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO CONSIDER OTHER FEATURES IN WHICH IT IS CONTENDED THAT THE ACT OF MARCH 14 1904 IS INVALID IT BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL IN THE PARTICULARS POINTED OUT THE APPELLEES HAD NO POWER OR AUTHORITY TO LEVY OR COLLECT THE TAX COMPLAINED OF THE ACT BEING UNCONSTITUTIONAL IT IS NOT A LAW IN CONFERS NO RIGHTS IT IMPOSES NO DUTIES IT AFFORDS NO PROTECTION IT CREATES NO OFFICE IT IS IN LEGAL CONTEMPLATION AS INOPERATIVE AS THOUGH IT HAD NEVER BEEN PASSED NORTON V SHELBY COUNTY 118 U S 425 6 SUP CT 1121 30 L ED 178 THE AUTHORITIES RELIED ON BY THE APPELLEES SEE AGNERS CASE APR 998CAMPBELL V BRYANT 103 VA 811 48 S E 493 IN SUPPORT OF THEIR ARGUMENT THAT THE COURTS HAVE NO POWER TO DISSOLVE A MUNICIPAL CHARTER AND THAT MUNICIPALITIES EXIST ONLY BY LEGISLATIVE SANCTION AND CANNOT BE DISSOLVED OR CEASE TO EXIST EXCEPT PURSUANT TO LEGISLATIVE PROVI SION HAVE NO APPLICATION TO A CASE LIKE THIS THERE IS NO UNDER TAKING TO DISSOLVE THE CHARTER OF MADISON HEIGHTS AND NO SUCH DECREE IS ASKED FOR IT IS A PROCEEDING SANCTIONED BY A LONG LINE OF VIRGINIA DECISIONS ASKING FOR RELIEF FROM AN UNCON STITUTIONAL AND THEREFORE ILLEGAL TAX WE ARE ONLY HOLDING THAT THE ACT ATTEMPTING TO INCORPORATE THE TOWN OF MADISON HEIGHTS AND PROVIDING FOR ITS ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT IS INVALID BECAUSE NOT PASSED IN CONFORMITY WITH THE CONSTITUTION OF THE STATE IN OTHER WORDS WE DETERMINE THAT THE ACT WHICH IT IS CLAIMED CREATES THE TOWN AND GIVES ITS COUNCIL THE POWER TO LEVY THE TAX COMPLAINED OF IS A NULLITY BECAUSE IN VIOLATION OF THE CONSTITUTION IF IT HAD EVER BEEN A VALID ACT THEN THE COURT COULD NOT ANNUL IT OR DECLARE IT FORFEITED THAT WOULD BE A LEGIS LATIVE POWER BUT WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A VALID ACT OR CHARTER AUTHORIZING THE TAX COMPLAINED OF IS A JUDICIAL QUESTION AND THE COURT NOT ONLY HAS THE RIGHT BUT IS BOUND TO PASS UPON SUCH A QUESTION WHENEVER IT IS PROPERLY PRESENTED FOR THESE REASONS THE DECREE APPEALED FROM MUST BE REVERSED AND THIS COURT WILL ENTER HERE SUCH DECREE AS THE LOWER COURT OUGHT TO HAVE ENTERED DECLARING THE TAX COMPLAINED OF INVALID AND PERPETUALLY ENJOINING THE APPELLEES FROM ALL FURTHER ATTEMPT TO COLLECT THE SAME NOTETHE MAIN POINT OF THIS DECISION IS THE CONSTRUCTION GIVEN OF SEC 117 OF THE CONSTITUTION OF VIRGINIA WHICH PROVIDES GENERAL LAWS FOR THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS SHALL BE ENACTED BY THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND NO SPECIAL ACT SHALL BE PASSED IN RELATION THERETO EXCEPT IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN ARTICLE FOUR OF THIS CONSTITUTION AND THEN ONLY BY RECORDED VOTE OF TWOTHIRDS 23 OF THE MEMBERS ELECTED TO EACH HOUSE IN SPEAKING OF THIS PROVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION THE COURT SAYS OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE CAN AS FORMERLY GRANT CHARTERS CREATING CITIES AND TOWNS BUT WHEN SUCH CHARTERS ARE GRANTED THE CITY OR TOWN SO CHARTERED MUST BE ORGANIZED AND GOVERNED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL LAWS OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE OBNOXIOUS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISION FORBIDDING SPECIAL LEGIS LATION THE COURT THEN GOES ON TO SHOW WHEREIN THE CHARTER IN QUES TION IS OBNOXIOUS TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL INHIBITION AGAINST SPECIAL LEGISLATION THE EFFECT OF THE DECISION SEEMS TO BE THAT THE LEGISLA TURE STILL HAS POWER TO INCORPORATE CITIES AND TOWNS BUT THE CHARTERS THUS GRANTED BY THE LEGISLATURE MUST BE IN CONFORMITY WITH THE GEN ERAL LAWS IN REGARD TO THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND 1906 99911 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER TOWNS WHICH GENERAL LAWS ARE FOUND IN CHAPTER 44 OF THE CODE AND ACTS AMENDATORY THEREOF IN ANOTHER PORTION OF THE DECISION THE COURT SAYS WHAT SPECIAL ACTS MAY BE PASSED IN RELATION TO CITIES AND TOWNS UNDER ARTICLE 4 OF THE CONSTITUTION NEED NOT NOW BE CONSIDERED FOR IT IS CLEAR THAT CITIES AND TOWNS NOT IN EXISTENCE WHEN THE CONSTI TUTION WENT INTO EFFECT CAN ONLY BE INCORPORATED UNDER GENERAL LAW THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURT HERE IN SAYING THAT CITIES AND TOWNS NOW CAN ONLY BE INCORPORATED UNDER GENERAL LAW SEEMS AT FIRST BLUSH TO BE CONTRADICTORY TO THE LANGUAGE QUOTED ABOVE IN WHICH IT IS SAID THAT THE LEGISLATURE CAN GRANT CHARTERS CREATING CITIES AND TOWNS IN USING THE TERMS INCORPORATED UNDER GENERAL LAW THE COURT NEC ESSARILY MEANT INCORPORATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF THE GENERAL LAW FOR IF IT IS MEANT THAT NO CITY OR TOWN CAN BE INCORPORATED BY SPECIAL ACT THERE IS AN EVIDENT CONTRA DICTION IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT THE GRANT OF A CHARTER BY THE LEG ISLATURE BEING OF NECESSITY BY SPECIAL ACT THIS SECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION SAYS THAT NO SPECIAL ACT SHALL BE PASSED IN RELATION TO THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS EXCEPT IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN ARTICLE FOUR OF THIS CONSTI TUTION AND THEN ONLY BY THE RECORDED VOTE OF TWOTHIRDS 23 OF THE MEMBERS ELECTED TO EACH HOUSE WHICH BEING INTERPRETED AFFIRMA TIVELY DECLARES THAT SPECIAL ACTS MAY BE PASSED IN RELATION TO THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS BUT ONLY IN THE MANNER PROVIDED IN ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CONSTITUTION AND WITH THE ADDITIONAL PROVISO THAT THEY SHALL BE PASSED ONLY BY A RECORDED VOTE OF TWOTHIRDS 23 OF THE MEMBERS ELECTED TO EACH HOUSE ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CONSTITUTION IS THE GENERAL ARTICLE IN REGARD TO THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT THE ONLY SECTIONS OF THAT ARTICLE TO WHICH SEC 117 HAS REFERENCE ARE SEC 50 WHICH RELATES TO THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS SEC 51 WHICH RELATES TO THE ENACTMENT OF SPECIAL PRIVATE AND LOCAL LEGISLATION SEC 52 WHICH HAS REFERENCE TO THE TITLE OF A BILL AND SEC 53 WHICH HAS REFERENCE TO THE TIME WHEN LAWS TAKE EFFECT IT SEEMS CLEAR THEREFORE THAT SEC 117 DOES NOT PREVENT THE PASSAGE OF SPECIAL LAWS WITH REFER ENCE TO THE ORGANIZATION AND GOVERNMENT OF CITIES AND TOWNS BUT ONLY PRESCRIBES THE METHOD BY WHICH SUCH SPECIAL LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED IF THIS BE THE TRUE CONSTRUCTION OF THAT SECTION THEN THE FIRST QUESTION FOR CONSIDERATION IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE WAS WAS THE ACT OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY APPROVED MARCH 14TH 1904 ENTITLED AN ACT TO INCORPORATE THE TOWN OF MADISON HEIGHTS ETC PASSED IN THE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION FOR THE PASSAGE OF SPECIAL LAWS AND ALSO BY A RECORDED VOTE OF TWOTHIRDS 23 OF THE MEMBERS ELECTED TO EACH HOUSE AND THE LANGUAGE OF THE COURT IN SAYING WHAT SPECIAL ACTS MAY BE PASSED IN RELATION TO CITIES AND TOWNS UNDER ARTICLE FOUR OF THE CONSTITUTION NEED NOT NOW BE CONSIDERED IS MIS LEADING FOR THE SECTION HAS NO REFERENCE TO THE KIND OF ACTS THAT MAY BE PASSED BUT ONLY PRESCRIBES THE METHOD BY WHICH SPECIAL ACTS MAY BE PASSED CB C B G APR 1000

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1108805,Impropriety of Argument Based on Failure to CrossExamine Witnesses in Rebuttal of Defendants Good Character,i246142,8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S combination of a railway company and a coal company The opinion is not reported 280 Fed  42 Sup Ct 35 but we have been fur nished a certified copy of the memorandum opinion and its language is so pertinent that we quote it as expressing our view One who takes a mortgage upon several items of property of such character that their common ownership or operation may offend against the AntiTrust Law or the commodities clause and such that the mortgage serves practically to aid in tying them together must be deemed to hold his mortgage subject to the contingency that if the complete and final separation of one item of the mortgage property from the remainder becomes essential to the due enforcement of ei ther named law the court charged with such enforcement may take control of that item free if from the consolidating tendency of the mortgage and substitute therefor its judicially ascertained equivalent Otherwise the mortgage will stand as the ready means of restoring or at least tending to restorethose conditions which the court is en deavoring to destroy It may well be true that a railroad and a coal company under common ownership and management are worth more as security under a mortgage than when independent and that their effective separation does impair the mortgage security but this cannot make the law helpless We have no desire to vary the security of the bondholders more than seems necessary to effect fully the purpose of the law and wish to recognize their equities as against the two companies and the stock holders as will later appear Impropriety of Argument Based on Failure to CrossExamine Wit nesses in Rebuttal of Defendants Good CharacterIn State v Van Hoozer 185 N W 588 the Supreme Court of Iowa held that in a prosecution for larceny of an automobile where defendant introduced character witnesses and the state crossexamined regarding other acts and crimes of defendant argument that defendants counsel had failed to crossexamine witnesses in rebuttal of defendants good char acter was improper The court said in part We cannot set our seal of approval upon such methods to secure the conviction of one charged with crime Ability skill alertness and zeal in a public prosecutor are commendable and should be en couraged It is for the good of society for the welfare of the state that crime shall be punished and that the prosecution of criminals shall be vigilant and vigorous But under our laws the person charged with crime has certain wellknown rights which the state is bound to respect Time and again we have declared that proof of other crimes than the one with which a defendant is charged is not admissible against him The state cannot do by the indirect method 542  NovNOTES O1 CASES resorted to in the instant case that which it would not be permitted to do directly State v Kimes 152 Iowa 240 132 N W 180 cited by counsel for appellee does not justify the proceedings had in the instant case In said case we said While the rule is that in rebutting evidence of good moral char acter offered by defendant the state cannot introduce evidence as to particular transactions it is certainly competent on crossexamination of a witness who has testified as to defendants good moral character to ask whether there have not been rumors or reports in the community as to his bad character with reference to particular transactions We do not intend to depart from the rule thus announced but in the instant case the county attorney went much farther in crossex amination than could be allowed under this rule and supplemented this by argument highly prejudicial and exceedingly improper We are disposed to allow a wide latitude in the arguments of counsel realizing the native ability of the average juror to make due allowance for oratorical embellishment and histrionic display but we cannot tol erate abuse of the properties of argument and permit counsel to go unleashed into the fields of denunciation and accusation to secure con viction of one charged with crime New Mexico Statute Held Violative of Right of Free SpeechThe New Mexico Statute chapter 140 Laws 1919 provides as follows Section 1 That it shall be unlawful for

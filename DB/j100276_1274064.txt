j100276,Michigan Law Review,1274064,Easements Acquisition of over Railroad Right of Way,i254420,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW question involved was whether the fee to the strip was excepted or merely a right of way reserved The question as to whether a particular clause is an exception or a reservation is one of intention If the language is ambig uous parol evidence of the circumstances and collateral facts may be intro duced but if not whatever may be the real intention it must be gathered from the instrument alone Whether or not the language is so ambiguous is to be decided by the court from the nature of the provision the situation of the parties and the subject matter Engel v Ayer 85 Me 448 452 27 Atl 352 Biles v Tacoma etc R R Co 5 Wash 509 512 32 Pac 211 A rule sometimes resorted to in close cases is that as every exception or reservation is the act of the grantor it should be construed most strictly against him and most beneficially for the grantee Wellman v Churchill 92 Me 193 42 Atl 352 From the extrinsic facts in this case there was no question but that all parties regarded the clause as the exception of the fee these facts decided the case inasmuch as the court held the language ambiguous A correct result probably but it is noteworthy that one of the cases cited as supporting the court stands directly opposed to it in construing a very sim ilar clause Fisher v Laack et al I890 76 Wis 313 3I9 In this case the clause except the south twelve feet to be used as an alley was held plain and unambiguous and proof of extrinsic facts was held inadmissible to contradict it or affect its construction Although the word except was employed the subject matter to which it referred was a reservation and it was so held DEEDSFILLING BLANKSAUTHORITY IMPLIEDWhere A assigned a mortgage to B and delivered the assignment to him with the name of the assignee in blank and nothing was said by A to B as to the authority to fill the blanks and B filled the same it was Held that when one delivers an instrument whether the same be required to be under seal or not so executed as to in form give it full validity upon the filling up of the blanks authority for the holder thereof to do that is implied Friend v Yahr et al I905  Wis  Io4 N W Rep 997 The rule that blanks in a deed could not be filled by a third person unless expressly authorized to do so by writing or by parol was questioned as early as 1822 by CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL in the case of United States v Nelson 2 Brock 64 Marshalls prophecy that the strict rule of the common law would be some day set aside is fast coming true The principal case is in line with this tendency and goes so far as to hold that one to whom a deed containing blanks is given has implied authority to fill the blanks This rule applies to deeds as well as to commercial paper Nelson v McDonald 80 Wis 605 27 Am St Rep 7I and cases there cited This rule applies to blanks in surety bonds Dolbeer v Livingston 100 Calif 617 to an assign ment of corporate stock Bridgeport Bank v New York etc Ry Co 30 Conn 231 to consideration in deeds and mortgages Quinn v Brown 71 Ia 376 34 N W R 13 Reed v Morton 24 Neb 760 EASEMENTSACQUISITION OF OVER RAILROAD RIGHT OF WAYIn a suit brought by an abutting property owner for the purpose of preventing the 398RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 399 elevation of the tracks upon the railroads right of way the complainant claimed an easement of a longitudinal right of way obtained by user alongside the railroad tracks Held that such an easement being inconsistent with its proper use by the railroad company will not be presumed from mere user Johnson v Philadelphia B 6d W R Co I905Del  62 Atl Rep 86 An easement may be acquired by prescription across the railroad right of way Hardy v Alabama  V Ry Co 73 Miss 719 722 19 So 661 Gay et al v Boston  A R R Co 14I Mass 407 408 6 N E 236 Turner v Fitchburg R Co 145 Mass 433 435 14 N E 627 But as was said in this case a right to use a railroads right of way longitudinally is totally different and the law is clearly with the Delaware court in denying the existence of such an easement Several reasons have been given by the courts in arriving at a like conclusion the one given in this case being that such use of the track cannot be consistent nor subordinate to the use by the railroad Again it has been denied that the railroads have any right to grant or create such an easement and therefore that a grant cannot be presumed Sapp et ux v Northern Central Ry Co 5I Md II5 I24 It seems to be immaterial whether the railroad company owns the right of way in fee or has merely an easement The power to grant such an easement would be subversive of the very purposes for which railroad charters are granted Sapp et ux v Ry Co supra In the case of abutters on city streets in which the railroad tracks are laid however the abutting owner has whether he owns the fee or not a right of ingress and egress constituting an easement of access to his premises Elizabethtown etc R Co v Combs o1 Bush Ky 382 I9 Am Rep 67 ELLIOTT ON RAILROADS  IO85 In the case at bar however the complainant failed to show that the railroads right of way was a public highway EVIDENCINSTRUCTION TO JURYCIRCUMSTANTIAL EvIDENCEWhere in a trial for murder an instruction was asked for that each link in the chain of circumstances should be established to the entire satisfaction of the jury held no error to refuse such instruction State v Blydenburgh 1905  Ia Io4 N W Rep 1015 No cases are cited and there is a strong dissenting opinion with many citations In State v Hayden 45 Ia II it was held that the jury need not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of every link in the chain of circum stances necessary to establish guilt that it is a reasonable doubt of guilt aris ing from a consideration of all the evidence in the case which entitles the defendant to an acquittal This case seems to have been overruled in State v Cohen Io8 Ia 208 as indicated in the dissenting opinion in the main case It has been held that it is not necessary that the jury be instructed that they must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of each link in the chain of circumstances relied upon to establish defendants guilt Bressler v People II7 Ill 422 But the contrary has been held in many cases Graves v People I8 Col I70 People v Aiken 66 Mich 460 Marion v State I6 Neb 349 It would seem in the main case that the dissenting opinion is the better law It is very probable that the court being satisfied that the defendant was guilty

boundary near this place at an elevation of six thou sand feet is a stretch of tablelands covered with large pines Pinus Jeffreysi broken by many ridges of giant granite bowlders decomposing sufficiently to add materially to the soil Broad grassy meadows furnish food for cattle and deer My father and myself in riding through this forest in July 1883 noticed several pines with the bark bored into at varying distances from the base of the tree to the branches and in about onethird of the holes were the acorns of the here common Quercus Emoryi very tightly fitted the holes containing the acorns apparently newly made The remaining holes were weatherbeaten and in them were equally tightly fitted bits of the granite gravel of size corresponding with the acorns in the other holes In the Cuyama ca Mountains of this county a gentleman observed Colaptes auratus visit pines that contained similarly disposed acorns The woodpecker tapped the acorns breaking one now and then the broken shells show ing plain traces of having contained a worm while the other acorns contained sound kernels But what ob ject could the birds have in substituting stones as shown above  Possibly they served as hidingplaces for many insects which would otherwise have secured places inaccessible to the birds C R ORCUTT San Diego Cal Feb 16 How a spider sometimes lifts heavy objects to its nest Last summer while at Lynchburg Va I observed a spiderprobably an Epeiraspinning a thread down from the upper section of a large fountain on the lawn of the Arlington hotel He was some eight feet from the surface I watched him descend to the water where he captured a beetle that had unfor tunately fallen into the large basin The beetle must have been an inch long Our Epeira made a turn of his line around his captive and ascended all the way to his nest immediately descending he threw another loop around his prey and again ascended to his nest continuing this process for full ten min utes to my surprise while the spider was at his web apparently overhauling and tightening the several threads that he had spun to and from the beetle it left the water and evidently by elastic contraction of the threads ascended full an inch from the surface The spider spun down another lasso and threw it round his victim then retired and was busy with his lines when the beetle again moved upwards These operations were repeated until at the end of fortyfive minutes he had snugly secured his prey in his nest at a distance of at least eight feet from the water by this curious and interesting method Cambridge March 3 E P LARKIN The use of the method of limits in mathemati cal teaching I notice in a recent number of Science a proposal to discuss the different methods of teaching the ele ments of the infinitesimal calcaci and in connec tion with this an allusion to Professors jiice and Johnsons New method of rates I trust it is not out of place to suggest that the method in question seems to me very like the method given in Maclaurins Fluxions which the author attributes at least partially to Newton and that the present very general use of the method of limits is probably a case of the survival of the fittest for I have found in my experience as a teacher that those NCE 305 who are either too young or too slow to acquire at once the deeper conceptions of mathematics are often capable of doing very good work when the demon strations are adapted to their comprehension The method of limits seems to me that which must be used with a class if it is desired to give a sure foundation to as many as possible the method of rates or fluxions requires rather more preparation of mind and the infinitesimal method is best adapted to those who have mathematical genius The average engineer or architect is a person whose natural bent is towards construction and the use of tools Such a person will in all probability require the infinitesimal calculus as a tool rather than as a recreation or a profession and should therefore be trained by a slow and certain processlike the method of limits  in order that his real abilities may not be disguised by any slowness of comprehen sion in a matter which he can by patience acquire The weakness of mathematics as a general study in our institutions lies in the rapidity with which the successive steps are passed over so that the slower pupils are left behind and become discouraged Old country schools do more solid work in average cases TRUMAN HENlRY SAFFORD Williams college March 1 THE IN ERNATIONAL BUREAU OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES1 THE annual report of operations for 1883 has just been received It shows a steady ad vance towards the completion of the interna tional standards All the principal instruments and apparatus have now been procured and are in position The comparateur geodesique for which a contract was made with the Socite Genevoise in 1882 was to have been delivered by August of last year Various events con spired to delay its complete delivery but at the close of the report the entire apparatus was on its way and was to be set up in the early part of January All necessary masonry work was done in the spring of 1883 Changes have been made in the method of heating the room of the Brunner comparator Hitherto it has been done by regulating the temperature of water held between the double zinc walls in which the room is enclosed It has been found however that in addition to the difficulty and expense of maintaining a con stant temperature of the water day and night trouble was experienced from frequent leaks in the zinc walls necessitating repairs and stopping the observations consequently the maintenance of temperature by the use of hot water has been discontinued and for it has been substituted hot air which so far has proved satisfactory and which it is hoped will solve the problem of heating 1 Crite international des poids et mesures Septi6me rap port aim

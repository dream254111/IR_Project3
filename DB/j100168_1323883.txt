j100168,Harvard Law Review,1323883,The Last Chance Doctrine,i256893,THE LAST CHANCE DOCTRINE The party who has the last clear opportunity of avoiding the accident notwithstanding the negligence of his opponent is considered solely responsible for it The last chance doc trine thus expressed was adopted in a recent Louiisiana case Banhniil v Texas i P R R Co 33 So Rep 63 T houigh stated so broadly its im portance as a doctrine is confined to those cases wlhere the last opportunity to avoid the damage lies with the defendanit for whlere the negligence of both parties is concurrent or where the plaintiff has the last chance recovery is denied by wellestablished rules of contributory negligence The origin of the doctrine is found in the case of Davies v Mann io M  W 546 The basis there suggested for it is that though the plain tiff was negligent his negligence was no part of the legal cause of his dam age since the defendant had the last chance to avoid the accident The New Hampshire court stated this position clearly when it said that under such circumstances the defendants negligence was in law the sole cause of the injury See Nashua Iron etc Co v Worcester etc R R 62 N H I59 I63 In that case however the fact appeared that a third partys prop erty had been damaged by the accident and that he had been allowed re covery against the plaintiff This was possible only on the ground that the plaintiffs negligence was a legal cause of the third partys damage The plaintiffs negligence thus was treated as a legal cause of the third partys dam age though not of his own Since the facts in the cases were tlle same and the damage to each was apparently a natural and probable consequence of the plaintiffs negligence the inconsistency in the courts position is apparent The last chance doctrine consequently must stand if at all as an exception366 HARVARD LA W REVIEW to the general rule which denies recovery to a plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence TI he bar raised by contributory negligence rests on the policy of making the loss lie on a person who has been instrumental in bringing it upon him self See 3 HARV L REV 269 Prima facie the last clhance rule seems to shiift the loss to the defendant merely because he happens to be the last wrongdoer The argument is often made however that the negligence of a defendant occurring under the circumstances created by the plaintiffs prior negligence is more serious than that of the plaintiff But it is hard to see how a higher degree of care could be demanided of the defendant by virtue of the prior negligence unless he had knowledge of it Cf THOMP Com NEG  232 If such knowledge were made essential the statement of the rule would take its strongest form Evei so it is open to two objections In the first place it is based oni the discredited theory of comparative negligence which allows recovery to a negligent plaintiff when the defendants negligence is 1 gross and his own but  ordinary  or  slight See Cicero etc Ry v Mezxer i6o 111 320 And secondly thus qualified it would rarely prove of practical value for if the defend ant had the required knowledge his tort generally wotuld amount to an intentional tort to which the rules of contributory negligence have no application See SPRAGUE CONTRIB NEG 7 Thle last chance rule as a distinct doctrine accordingly seems to deserve no place in the law

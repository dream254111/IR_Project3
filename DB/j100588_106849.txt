Rev Charles Wildbore communicated by Earl Stanhope F R S Read June 24 1790 THIS Paper which has cost me much pains in patient investigation is occasioned by that of Mr LANDEN in the Philosophical Transactions Vol LXXV Part II I am no stranger to this gentlemans great judgement and abilities in these abstruse speculations but have a very high opinion of both yet I could not but think it strange that two such ma thematicians as M DALEMBERT and M L EULER should both follow one another on the same subject both agree and still not be right I therefore resolved to try to dive to the bottom of their solutions which those who are acquainted with the subject know to be no light task and if possible to give the solution independent of the perplexing consideration of a momentary axis changing its place both in the body and in absolute space every instant and which I look upon as not ab solutely essential to the determination of the bodys motion But finding that I could not thus so readily shew the agree ment or disagreement of my conclusions with those of the gen tlemen who have preceded me in this enquiry I have also added the investigation of the properties of this axis And I suppose it will be found that I have added many properties unknown before or at least unnoticed by any of them M LANDENS20 30 40 50 60 The seven Satellites of appeared to be situated the 18 at 7h 51 54 1789

every body be its form ever so irregular will revolve in the same manner as if its mass were equally divided and placed in the eight angles or disposed in the eight octants of a regular parallelo pipedon whose moments of inertia round its three permanent axes are the same as those of the body serves admirably to shorten the investigation and render the solution perspicuous I have therefore here taken its truth for granted because it is also exactly agreeable to the solutions of the other gentlemen and saves the trouble of repeating what they have done before I have also shewn wherein and why his solution differs from theirs and proved as I think undeniably in what respects it is defective That the inertia or as M EULER calls it the momentum of inertia is equal to the fluent or sum of every particle of the body drawn into the square of its distance from the axis of motion and the determination of the three permanent axes or the demonstration that there are at least three such axes in every body round any one of which if it revolved the velo city would be for ever uniform I have also taken for granted because these things have been proved before and all the gen tlemen are agreed in them Difficulties that occurred I have not concealed but shewn how to obviate and endeavoured to place the truth in as clear a light as possible which to disco ver is my wish or to welcome it by whomsoever found P R O P O S I T I O N I Whilst a globe whose centre is at rest revolves with a given velocity about an axis passing through that centre to VOL LXXX T t t find498 Mr WILDBORE on find with what velocity any great circle on the surface but oblique to that axis moves along itself Let I Tab XX fig 1 be the centre and BLb the axis round which the globe revolves with a velocity  c measured along the great circle GH whose plane is perpendicular to that axis and HSGs any great circle whose plane is oblique to the axis ESF and esf two lesser circles of the sphere parallel to the great cir cle GH and touching HSGs in S and s then as the radius BI which may be supposed unity c the radius of the less circle ESF  the sine of the arc BE or BS the velocity along the circle ESF  the absolute velocity of the point S on the surface of the globe but the point S is also upon the great circle GSHs and therefore this is also equal to the velocity of the point s along the great circle GSHs and for the same reasons the point S which is diametrically opposite to S on the surface has also the same velocity Let P be any other point in the great circle GSHs then since as the globe revolves the distances SP and sP always continue invariable the velocity of the point P in the circle HPS in the direction of the periphery of the circle itself must be equal to that of S and s and is therefore the velocity of every point of this circle along its own periphery Corollary 1 Hence it follows that in whatsoever manner a globe revolves its velocity measured on the same great circle on its surface must be the same at the same time at every point of the periphery of that circle Corollary 2 Consequently howsoever the plane of a great circle varies its motion the velocity at any instant is at every point of the periphery equal along its own plane D E F Ierical Motion 499 D E F I N I T I O N The points S and s where a great circle from the poles B and b of the natural axis cuts any great circle GSHs at right angles I call the nodes of that great circle Corollary 3 If O be the pole of the great circle HSGs then the globe may be considered as moving round the axis whose pole is O with a velocity  c X sine of BSBI whilst the pole O is car ried along the lesser circle AOA which is parallel to the mid circle GH with a velocity  c X sin ObBI  c X cos BSBI and this way of considering the motion which is useful in what follows comes to the very same as the motion along the great or midcircle GH with the velocity  c because c2 X s BS2BI2  c2 X cos BS2BI2  c2 Consequently the sum of the squares of the velocities at the node and pole of any great circle upon a spherical surface thus revolving is equal to the square of the velocity round the natural or momentary axis BIb Corollary 4 Since the pole O is at 90 distance from the node S its motion can have no effect at S or s the motion at the nodes therefore of the great circle HSGs is that of the great circle along its own proper plane but any other point as P partakes both of the motion along the circle and the motion of its pole The direction of its motion being along the lesser circle Pp parallel to FSE and its velocity therein  c X s BPs BS the velocity of P therefore in the direction of the great circle OP which is perpendicular to SP in P is  c s BP2s BS2  s BS2BI2 and along the great circle BP its velocity  0 T t t 2 P R O P O500 Mr WILDBORE on P R O P O S I T I O N II Supposing the centre of a sphere to be at rest whilst the surface moves round it in any manner whatsoever then if the same invariable point O considered as the pole of an axis of the sphere be itself in motion the angular velocity of the spherical surface about axis will be unequable or that of one point therein different from that of another For let I fig 2 be the centre of the sphere draw the great circle POF perpendicular to the direction of the motion of the surface at O then must the pole of this motion neces sarily be in some point P of this great circle POF Let FC be the great circle whose pole is P and LQ that whose pole is O then the velocity of any point F of the great circle FC must by the preceding proposition be equal to that of any other point H thereof Let that velocity be represented by the equal arches FG and HK and from the pole O draw the great circles OGM OHN and OKA cutting the great circle LQ in M N and A then must LM represent the angular velo city of the point F about the axis IO and NA that of the point H But by Prop 9 Lib III THEODOSII Sphericorum LM is greater than NA and consequently the angular velocity of the point F about IO is greater than that of H and conse quently the angular velocity of the surface about the axis IO is unequable Corollary Hence about whatever axis the angular motion of a sphere is equable the pole of that axis and consequently the axis itself must be at rest at the instant Different motions may have different correspondent poles and consequently when the motion is variable the place of the pole of equable motionSpherical Motion 501 motion on the surface may vary but whatever point on the surface corresponds with that pole must at the instant be at rest P R O P O S I T I O N III Let ABC fig 3 be an octant of a spherical surface in mo tion while the centre is at rest and let the velocity of the great circle BC in its own plane  a and in a sense from B towards C that of CA in the sense from C towards A  b and of AB from A towards B  c If these three velocities a b and c be constant the spherical surface will always re volve uniformly about the same axis of the sphere at rest in absolute space For let ABC abc be two positions of the revolving octant indefinitely near each other Aa Bb and Cc the tracks of A B and C in absolute space Perpendicular to Aa draw the great circle SOA and perpendicular to Bb the great circle BOQ cutting SOA in O and CA in Q then because Aa is indefi nitely small the two triangles Apa rightangled at p and a Aq rightangled at A may be considered as plane ones and are therefore similar and since the angles pAQ and qAa are both right ones taking away qAp which is common the angles pAa qAQ must be equal but as pA pa c b likewise pA pa s paA s pAa and paA  pAq pAa  qAQ con sequently as s pAq s qAQ c b that is the sines of the angles BAS and CAS are proportional to the velocities along AB and CA consequently the sines of the arches SB and SC which are the measures of those angles must be in the same ratio In like manner it appears that as s CQ s AQ 4 a502 Mr WILDBORE on a c s CBQ s ABQ Moreover s SOB radius s SB  s BO s AQ s AO Through C and O draw the great circle COR then as s AO radius s OAR s OR s OAQ s OQ or s OR s OQ s OAR s OAQ c b and for a like reason s OR s OS s OBR s OBS c a that is s OR c s OQ b s OS a or s OQ s OS b a but s OQ s OS s OCQ  s AR s OCS  s BR or s AR s BR b a Now bc is ultimately perpendicular to AC in d so the triangle Cdc being rightangled at d the sum of the angles Ccd cCd must be  a right one and their sines are in the ratio of Cd cd or of b a but the sum of the angles OCQ OCS is also a right one and their sines also have been proved to be in the same ratio of b a consequently the angle OCQ  Ccd and OCS  cCd to OCS and cCd add the common angle OCQ and the angle OCc must be  BCQ a right one conse quently OC is perpendicular to Cc the track of the point C as OA is by hypothesis to Aa and OB to Bb The sines of SO QO and RO are as a b and c also s SO2  s QO2  s RO2 by trigonometry  the square of radius  1 hence s SO2  s QO2  1  s RO2  s CO2 s SO2  s RO2  s BO2 s QO2  s RO2  s AO2 consequently s AO2 s BO2 and s CO2 are as b2  c2 a2  c2 and a2  b2 or as Aa2 Bb2 and Cc2 where fore the velocities  b2  c2  a2  c2 and  a2  b2 of the points A B C are in directions perpendicular to AO BO and CO and in the ratio of the sines of the arches AO BO and CO that is of the distances of the points A B and C from the axis whose pole is O the tracks of these points are  circles of the sphere whose radii are those distances And so long as the velocities a b and c are invariable the points Q R and S which are always at the same distances 3 fromSpherical Motion 503 from B C and A must be always at the same distances from O that is OR OS and OQ are constant and the point O at rest And this must also be the case if a b and c be variable provided they have the same constant ratio amongst themselves Corollary Hence the points Q R and S are the nodes of the great circles CQA ARB and BSC Scholium The demonstration of this proposition being thus strictly given some notion may be obtained of the manner in which the point O varies its place upon the spherical surface when the velocities along the circles AB BC and CA are va riable Thus let such spherical surface so revolving receive an instantaneous impulse at the distance of a quadrant or 90o from S in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the great circle CSB then the centre of the sphere may be kept at rest by an equal and contrary impulse at this centre and since by hypothesis the impulse is given 90o from S and in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the great circle CSB it can nei ther alter the place of the node S upon the circle nor the ve locity in the direction of its periphery but only those in AB and CA Thus if the velocity in BA which before was  c be now equal to z then as s SB z s SC the velocity along CA let this  y whilst still the velocity along CB con tinues as before  a and this will cause the point O to fall upon another point of the great circle SA so that whereas before the sines of OS OR and OQ were as a c and b they shall now be as a z and y Consequently as s SO rad  1 a the velocity at 90o from O s OR 1 z the velocity at 90o from O and s OQ y 1 velocity at 90o from O which three quantities must therefore be equal to one another and to the angular velocity of the sphere about the axis whose pole is504 Mr WILDBORE on is O let this angular velocity  e then must e X s SO  a e X s OR  z and e X s OQ  y and the sum of the squares of these three or a2  z2  y2  e2 X s SO2  e2 X s RO2  e2 X s QO2  e2 because s SO2  s RO2  s QO2  1 hence e   a2  z2  y2 whereas before the impulse e   a2  b2  c2 Thus not only the place of O but if z2  y2 be not  b2  c2 the angular velocity of the sphere about its single axis will also be altered Hence then if instead of an instantaneous im pulse a motive force be supposed to act in the same direction and measured at the same point where the impulse was just now supposed to act such force can neither vary the point S nor the velocity a but will in time vary b and c and cause the point O to alter its place in SA and thus the velocities b and c will vary to y and z and e   a2  b2  c2 to e   a2  y2  z2 just as it would have been by a single impulse excepting that then when the impulse was over y and z must have become constant quantities whereas now they will vary perpetually during the time that the motive force acts and the point O will shift its place so as at different times to coincide with dif ferent points of AS though at any one instant the point of the surface that coincides with it must be at rest by Prop 2 P R O P O S I T I O N IV If a spherical surface whose center is at rest revolve in any manner whatsoever so that the velocities along the three qua drants bounding any octant thereof be expressed by any three variable quantities x y and z to find the necessarily cor responding accelerating forces with which the place of the naturalSpherical Motion 505 natural or momentary axis and the angular velocity of the surface round it are varied Here other things remaining as in the preceding proposition instead of the constant quantities a b and c we have the variable ones x y and z Let the variable sines and cosines of AO BO and CO be respectively expressed by b and  g and  and d and  and let t  the time from the commencement of the motion then it is well known that the respective accelerating forces along CB CA and AB must be expressed by xt yt and zt and the radius of the sphere being supposed  unity the angular velocity about the axis whose pole is O  e   x2  y2  z2  e   e  x e  y e  z x  e  e y  e  e z  e  e 2  2  2  1   0 2  2  1  2  d2 2  2  1  2  g2 2  2  1  2  b2 e  xxyyzzx2y2z2  x  y  z  xe  ye  ze And by spherics as g 1

   Again the accelerating force in BA  zt resolved into the direction of the great circle BO at B is zt x cos OBR  zt x g and that xt along BC resolved into the same direction is xt x g and the

O towards E the same force reduced into the direction of the 23great circle BO at O is  e x  in the sense from O towards Q in like manner is found a force equivalent to that in CO but acting perpendicular to AOebd x  which reduced into the direction OD is  e x gt in the sense from O to wards D but this same force perpendicular to AO when reduced into the direction BO is  e x  in the sense from O towards Q which being added to the other above found force in BO gives    e x gt  the acce lerating force arising from those which act at O along the great circles OA OC which force acts in the sense from O towards Q and therefore in a contrary sense that is from O towards B it must be  e x gt as before found the operation thus proving itself In like manner from the two forces now found which act perpendicular to OB at O there must arise one acting along OD in the sense from O towards D which will therefore be  gt  egt x egt x       egt This last force may be otherwise found thus the acceleration  y round B at Q and as 1 g y gy  the acceleration round B at O owing to y in like manner the acceleration round C at O owing to z is  dz which resolved U u u 2 into508 Mr WILDBORE on into the direction perpendicular to BO at O is  dz X s ROE  zg also the acceleration bx at O perpendicular to AO reduced into the direction perpendicular to BO  bx X s DOS  xg hence the whole acceleration along DE at O which ma nifestly arises from these three is  xg  zg  gy and the acce lerative force  xzg2ygt which properly reduced becomes egt as before And the force which is compounded of the two forces e X gt and  egt is  egt   2  2  et 2  2  2 acting perpendicular to the track of O upon the moving spheri cal surface and et  x  y  zt is the accelerating force acting along the midcircle or that which is 90 distant from O to alter the velocity about the natural or momentary axis whose pole is O Hence answerable to the three accelerating forces xt yt and zt round the axes whose poles or ends A B and C are always the same invariable points upon the moving spherical surface there arise three other accelerating forces namely e X gt  egt and xyzt the two former acting at the pole of the momentary axis and the latter is that whereby the velocity about the momentary axis is altered S C H O L I U M I From the preceding investigation of the forces e X gt and  egt it follows that they are not at all affected in expression by theSpherical Motion 509 the variation of e but are denoted by the same quantities whether e be constant or variable which conclusion and also the values of the forces themselves is perfectly agreeable to what is brought out by Mr LANDEN by a method so very different in the Philosophical Transactions for 1777 But it is here carefully to be noted that these are not motive forces but accelerative ones for no notice whatever is yet taken of the internal structure of the revolving globe but the expressions hold true be that structure what it will if it be such that one and the same quantity drawn into each accele rating force will give the correspondent motive one then are the motive forces proportional to the accelerative ones but otherwise not It may here also be observed that it is quite conformable to nature that these accelerating forces should be expressed by the same quantities whether e be constant or va riable for these forces acting at the pole of the natural axis cannot possibly have any effect upon the velocity round it But it is not hence by any means to be concluded that the velo city about the axis is therefore constant because these are not in general the only accelerating forces that act upon the body but there is also a third accelerating force whose value is et arising from the different variability of x y and z and which cannot vanish except x  y  z  0 it therefore can only vanish in particular cases If the equation e  x  y  z be squared there will thence arise after due ordering e2  x2  y2  z2  e2 X   2    2    2 where the member which is drawn into e2 keeps its form whether e be constant or variable but by no means will x2  y2  z2 after due substitution do so 3 too510 Mr WILDBORE on too If e  0 then e2  x2  y2  z2 the motion being then round what M EULER and M DALEMBERT call the initial axis or that about which the body at rest would be first urged to move by any external forces acting upon it and which they have determined with so much labour though here it follows as a necessary consequence that the force with which the body is turned round this initial axis is  x2t2  y2t2  z2t2 or a force  the sum of the forces round the axes whose poles are A B and C Moreover by the general laws of all motion gt  gt and 222t2 are the velocities with which the pole of the mo mentary axis shifts its place in directions perpendicular to BO along BO and along its own track on the surface respec ctively And it is by taking the fluxions of these and dividing each fluxion by that of the time that the acce lerating forces are had which are due to such alteration of place of the momentary pole and these must by no means be confounded with the forces before found  egt and egt X    in those directions these last pertaining to the tendency of the surface itself to motion at O and the others to the shifting of the pole of the axis upon the surface which are different motions as will more clearly appear from what follows The preceding general properties of motion obtain in all bodies revolving round a center at rest be their motion ever so irregular the three great circles bounding an octant of the spherical surface revolving with the body are also taken ad libi tum being any such circles whatever upon the surface and hence the following very important consequence is drawn viz 1 IfSpherical Motion 511 If any body be in motion or put in motion by instantaneous impulse or otherwise about its center of gravity at rest in absolute space if by any means the accelerating forces acting along the three great circles bounding any octant of a spherical surface that has the same center of gravity and revolves with the body can be found those acting at every other point of such surface will neces sarily follow as natural consequences of these three and thus all the motions of such body will be absolutely determined S C H O L I U M  As the above conclusions are exceedingly general in order to form a distinct idea how such surface moves it may be pro per here to illustrate it by a particular example Let then the velocity x be supposed constant and also the angular velocity e then from what is shewn above since xx  0 e2  x2  y2  z2  e2 x 2  2  2 ee  yy  zz  0  e2 x        0   0  a constant quantity therefore b is constant and the track of the point O upon the surface is a lesser circle of the sphere at the constant distance AO from the invariable point A of the surface the radius of such lesser circle being  b  s AO fig 4 also y2  z2  the constant quantity e2  x2  e2  e22  e2b2  e2 x 2  2 zz   yy      gg and the velocity 2  2  2t2 with which the pole O shifts its place  2  2t2  22  222t2  bt  bt b2  2  EOt But still an expres sion for t is wanting to the two preceding data it is therefore necessary to add a third which may be that the velocity with which O shifts its place in the circle EOF is also constant Which will512 Mr WILDBORE on will come to the same as a case occurring hereafter when xt  0 yt   xzA and zt  xyA where A is some constant quantity for then x  0  e  e ee  xx  yy  zz  yy  zz  ey  ez e  y  z   xztA  xytA  e2tA x      0 therefore e is constant and t  Azxy  Aee2  Ae and since e  0 and x  e  e  0  e therefore   0  constant and    b2  2 therefore t  Aeb x b b2  2 and t  Aeb x arc EO consequently the velocity with which O shifts its place in the arch EO is  ebA which is a constant quantity P R O P O S I T I O N V The same being given as in the last proposition it is pro posed to illustrate the manner in which the surface moves with respect to a point at rest in absolute space Let Z fig 4 be a point touching the surface but at rest in absolute space whilst the surface moves under it in any man ner whatsoever In any one position of the octant ABC through Z draw the great circles As Bq and Cr which by the property of the sphere must be perpendicular to BC CA and AB respectively then must the velocities of the spheri cal surface at s q and r in directions perpendicular to each of the circles As Bq and Cr be x y and z the angular velocities therefore about Z with which the surface passes under s q and r must be xs Zs ys Zq and zs Zr through Z and O draw the quadrant of a great circle ZY then as  x s OY Spherical Motion 513  e x s OY  the velocity of the moving spherical surface at Y which is therefore the angular velocity of the surface at Y round an axis at rest whose pole is Z because ZY  90o which four values obtain let the point Z be taken at rest in absolute space wheresoever it will Also e x s OZ is the ve locity with which the surface passes under Z in a direction perpendicular to the great circle OZ at Z which must there fore be the real velocity of the surface itself there at that in stant therefore the fluxion of the track upon the surface which continually passes under Z is  e x s OZ x t   s Zs2  s Zq2  s Zr2 From which equation and the pro perties of O found in the preceding propositions general ex pressions for the relation of Z and O may be obtained But seeing that there is such a latitude in determining or fixing upon a proper point Z out of an infinity of points at rest and this handled in a general manner will run into a complex cal culus in order to fix upon a point Z under the most eligible conditions it may be best to deduce them from the properties of any particular problem that comes under consideration For example taking that in the second scholium to the last proposition where x and e are constant and y2  z2  e2  x2 is also constant and  e22  e22  e2  e22  e2b2 or 2  b2 also constant and the velocity with which O shifts its place along its proper track  ebA constant also Here in order to fix upon a proper point Z suppose the motion to begin when O fig 5 is upon the great circle AB at E and after some determinate time  t suppose the octant ABC to have arrived in the posi tion ABC and that in this time the point O has shifted its place from E to O that is supposing the octant ABC to be at rest in absolute space while ABC is in motion on AB VOL LXXX X x x taking514 Mr WILDBORE on taking Ae  AE the point O will have shifted its place in the time t in absolute space from E to O and upon the moving spherical surface from e to O along a less circle whose radius is equal to the sine of AE  s Ae  s AO  b Now at the commencement of the motion that is at AB the first velo city of the point A along CA is e x s AE  eb  the then value of y because the pole of the natural axis of motion E being then upon AB the value of z  0 and the pole E shifting its place in the sense EO in absolute space and the invariable point A of the spherical surface moving in the sense AA there must be some point Z between E and A at rest with respect to both these motions or round which both of them may be supposed performed its property must then be such that as s AZ s EZ  velocity of A  eb to the velocity with which the pole E begins to shift its place  eb x s EZs AZ but ebA is the velocity with which it shifts its place upon the moving spheri cal surface at E about the radius  s AE  s AZ  EZ And when O is at E the velocity with which the spherical surface passes under Z will be e x s EZ Again when O is the place of the momentary pole the velocity of the point A  y2  z2  e2  2  eb as before and the velocity with which O shifts it place round A  ebA as before it therefore shifts its place round some point Z in absolute space such that eb x s OZs AZ is still the velocity with which it shifts it which because AO  AE must be the same velocity and the same point Z as before Consequently the point O shifts its place along a lesser circle of the sphere whose radius  s EZ  s OZ and in the time of such shifting from E to O or from A to A the point of the 2 surfaceSpherical Motion 515 surface which at first was under Z will arrive at z in AB where Az  AZ and E considered as the same invariable point of the surface will arrive at e so that Ae  AE there fore since EZ  OZ is constant and Z at rest both with with respect to the velocity eb of A round it and the velocity ebA with which O shifts its place it must be as s EZ  s OZ s AZ ebA eb A 1 but b and  are the sine and cosine of AE  AO  EZ  AZ therefore as s EZ  b x cos AZ   x s AZ  x s AZ 1A 1 and as b x cos AZ  x s AZ 1A  1 1b  tang AE tang AZ  b x AA  1 and s AZ cos AZ  s BZ bA A  1 x  tang AE A  1A s AZ  AbA2  2A2  2 and cos AZ   A  1 x A2  2A2  2 and thus a dis tinct idea of this motion of the spherical surface is obtained it being now clear that the point A moves round Z at rest with the velocity eb and as s ZA 1 eb eA2  2A2  2A  the angular velocity with which A moves round the axis whose pole is Z which is therefore constant and at the same time the surface itself moves in the direction of the great circle BC that is about the axis whose pole is A with the constant velocity x  e which two motions may be considered as sepa rate and the rest as consequences of them that is the point Z is at rest and the point A moves uniformly round it whilst the surface upon which A is an invariable point moves round the axis whose pole is A with an uniform angular velo city these two angular velocities being in the ratio of X x x 2 516 Mr WILDBORE on A2  2A2  2A  or of A2 b2  A  12 x 2 A therefore the times being inversely as the velocities as A A2  2A2  2 the time

therefore can in no wise affect the velocities round those centres which velocities must still be the same relatively to the centres as if the centres were at rest Hence then the nature of this

O shifts its place once round the spherical surface in motion Hence then the nature of the motion round the momentary axis whose pole is O and the fixed one whose pole is Z will be apparent from the following simple contrivance A circle EO to radius  s ZO  s ZE being drawn upon a spherical surface at rest an octant of which is ABC let a paper or other518 Mr WILDBORE on other loose surface be fitted to this octant and having on the centre A and radius AE described a circular arc on the loose surface let the part thereof EOFCBE be cut away and completing the circle EF of the remaining part let the cir cumference of this circle be moved uniformly along the cir cumference of the less fixed circle EO with the celerity ebA beginning at the point E in each so that the moving circle may roll along the fixed one that is so that the arc Oe of the moving circle which has been in contact with the fixed one may be always equal to the arc EO of the fixed one with which it has been in contact then since OZ and ZA are constant and OZ perpendicular to both circles the point A must describe upon the fixed surface the same locus as in the case of the motion above specified The locus also of the mo mentary pole O will be the same and the angular velocity of A about the momentary axis the same as that of the moving surface about it for the celerity of O about the axis whose pole is Z  ebA being equal to the celerity about A in motion and the locus of A being a circle whose radius  s ZA we have as s ZO s ZA ebA eb  the velocity of A and as s OA  b eb radius  1 e  the velocity about the mo mentary axis as it ought From this complete solution of the particular case may be collected in general that if the octant ABC be taken such upon the moving spherical surface that the track of O there upon may cross the two great circles AB and AC at right angles a point which is at rest with respect to both motions or round which they are performed like a single motion may at the instant of the momentary poles crossing each of those greatSpherical Motion 519 great circles be found in the same manner as in the particular case here specified And it will also be found for any position of O by means of the expressions for the velocities found in Scholium I Prop IV but of this more hereafter P R O P O S I T I O N VI If a parallelopipedon or other  solid revolving uniformly with an angular velocity  Z about one of its permanent axes of rotation receive an instantaneous impulse in a direction pa rallel to that axis the centre of gravity of the body being supposed to be kept at rest by an equal and contrary impulse given to it and no other force acting upon the body it is proposed to determine the alteration in the motion thereof in consequence of such instantaneous impulse The impulse being by hypothesis given in a direction per pendicular to that of the then only motion of every particle of the body cannot instantly alter its angular velocity about the permanent axis but its immediate effect must be to cause the body to revolve about a fresh axis whilst the angular velocity and consequently the momentum of rotation about the first or permanent axis remain unaltered by such instantaneous im pulse for though it gives a different direction and velocity to the particles by causing them to revolve about another axis yet must their relative velocity about the first remain unaltered by the nature of relative motion because the second or addi tional motion is given in a direction perpendicular to the first Any alteration therefore which may be made in the velocity about the first axis by reason of the oblique motion of the particles about it owing to the then revolution about a fresh axis must be a work of time And to determine such alteration  See the note C at the end of the Paper let520 Mr WILDBORE on let M  the mass or solidity and 2d 2c and 2b be the three dimensions or length breadth and thickness of such parallelo pipedon then it is known that the momentum of inertia round the axis on which the dimension 2d is taken will be  13 M x c2  b2 this being no more than the product of a particle of the body into the square of its distance from such axis when integrated through the whole body as is now too well known to need the repetition here Let I fig 6 be the centre of gravity or of inertia they being both one of such parallelopipedon IB the permanent axis on which the dimen sion 2c is taken CI that on which 2b is taken and a perpen dicular to the plane BIC of the paper at I that on which 2d is taken then on the centre I describing the quadrant BSC whose radius BI or CI may be supposed unity if the body once revolve about this last named axis with an angular velo city  z measured along the great circle BSC and no external force or impulse act upon it it is agreed and well known that the centrifugal motive force round such axis will be  Mz2 x c2  b23 and always being equal in contrary directions round the axis can have no power to alter the place thereof but such motion and motive force continuing always the same the axis must be at rest and the velocity round it uniform for ever But if the body whilst so revolving receive as by hypothesis an impulse in a direction parallel to this axis that is perpendicu lar to the plane of the circle BCI and an equal and contrary one to keep the centre I still at rest the said impulse being perpendicular to the motion cannot instantly alter the angular velocity z but will give the axis itself a motion in a plane perpendicular to BCI and consequently about some axis SI in the plane BCI round which axis SI the centrifugal motive forcesSpherical Motion 521 forces of the particles being no longer in equilibrio because it is not a permanent axis except in particular cases this

and times may from hence be computed But it will be proper first to shew wherein and why these conclusions differ from those brought out by Mr LANDEN The three perturbating motive forces acting along the peri pheries of the three great circles CB CA and AB in fig 3 Prop IV are above found to be M3 x d2  c2 x yz M3 x b2  d2 x xz and M3 x c2  b2 x xy respectively or their equals M3 x d2  c2 x e2 M3 x b2  d2 x e2 and M3 x c2  b2 x e2 And if we sup pose the accelerations x y and z to be respectively propor tional to the motive forces the sum x  y  z must be propor tional to the sum of the three motive forces and xx  yy  zz or its equal ex  ey  ez must be proportional to M3 x d2  c2 x xe2  M3 x b2  d2 x ye2  M3 x c2  b2 x ze2  M3 x e3 x d2  c2  b2  d2  c2  b2 that is as nothing consequently

manner Here then the matter may be safely rested for the accelera tions are most certainly as the accelerative forces and not as the motive ones Conclusions therefore that are drawn from a contrary supposition cannot be true It may not however be improper to shew here how Mr LANDENS motive forces E and E arise from those above brought out thus in fig 3 Prop IV let s and t the sine and cosine of AQ to radius 1 that is let s  g and t  g then the motive force along BA resolved into the direction BO becomes M3 x c2  b2 x e2t and that along BC resolved into the same direction BO becomes M3 x d2  c2 x e2s the difference of these  M3 x e2 x d2  c2 x s  c2  b2 x t  Me2g3 x Ds2  C must be the motive force acting along the great circle BO in the sense from B towards O or from O towards Q and this is the very motive force E determined by Mr LANDEN and acting in the same manner The motive force which acts at O perpendicu larly to the force E is most readily obtained from that acting along CA for if a tangent be drawn to the great circle BOQ at O fig 3 it will intersect a radius of the sphere drawn through Q at a distance g from I the centre of the sphere  the secant of the arc OQ and as 1 1g  that secant the force MDe23 acting at the distance Q from the centre MDe23g  MDe2gst3 the force acting in the plane of the great circle CIA at the distance 1g from the centre I and perpendicular to a tangent at O526 Mr WILDBORE on O to the great circle BOQ which force being in a direction parallel to and in the same plane with the motive force acting at O perpendicular to the same tangent must be equal to it that is the motive force which acts perpendicular to E at O is  Me2g3  Dst  Mr LANDENs force E And this may also be deduced by finding by resolution the motive forces along CO and AO and reducing them into the direction of the great circle DOE at O in the same manner as the accelerating forces are managed in Prop IV above Now these forces E and E not being the only perturbating ones that disturb the motion of the body but others arising from the nonequilibrium of the particles in motion round the axes which are perpendicular to the planes of the varying momentary great circles BOQ DOE they will neither divided by their respective inertia M3    b2  c2  d2  b2  s2 and M3 x d2  b2  2 x c2  b2  s2 2  b2 give the accelerating forces along those circles nor are pro portional to

means of the three original equa tions above investigated which express the values of the three accelerating forces xt yt and zt as will be shewn hereafter But it is of importance to have proved here that this different method when rightly treated comes to the same as the other S C H O L I U M528 Mr WILDBORE on S C H O L I U M 11 The velocity of the body in directions of the peripheries of three great circles bounding an octant of the spherical surface which revolves with it might have been referred to any other octant besides that whose angles as in the preceding solution are in the poles of the three permanent axes but then besides the perturbating force arising from the motion of the body about each of the three axes whose poles are in the nodes of the great circles bounding such octant there will pertaining to each circle be another perturbating force arising from the nonequilibrium of the particles of the body in motion in planes parallel to the plane of each circle which being considered would greatly perplex the operation And hence arises the necessity for referring the motion to permanent axes because about them this lastmentioned perturbating force vanishes by reason of the perfect equilibrium of the particles in motion round them their property being such that if the body begin to move simply round one of them it must uniformly con tinue so to do for ever And if as in the preceding proposition the body be compelled to move round some other axis still during the elementary time t notwithstanding that each of these axes or their poles has a proper motion of its own yet the relative angular velocity and consequently the inertia and motive force round each axis will be the same as if the body revolved with the single angular velocity x y or z round only one of them and consequently such velocity can have no power to alter itself but the equilibrium of the particles tends to preserve it for the particles by their motion round one of these axes cannot alter the angular velocity about it but such 2 alterationSpherical Motion 529 alteration must be caused by the other motions of the body which are referred to the other two permanent axes as in the foregoing solution and thus produce the forces xt yt and zt acting at the nodes S Q and R of the great circles BC CA and AB If the two great circles DOE CQA be continued they will meet in a point of the midcircle 90o from O and make an angle whose measure is the arc OQ and if Mr LAN DENS motive force E be resolved into the direction of the great circle CA it will become E x cos OQE x g  M3 x a2  b x e2 the very same as investigated in the fore going proposition But Mr LANDENS method besides the force E perpendicular to BO will likewise give two other motive forces perpendicular to AO and CO at O which re solved into the directions of the great circles BC and AB will also give the above investigated motive forces in those circles and thus the two methods prove each other I know then of no objection but what is already obviated I shall therefore proceed to the solution of the following pro position first independent of the consideration of a momen tary axis the properties of which shall be investigated after wards I could easily give the demonstration that the pro perties above shewn to belong to the parallelopipedon also per tain to any other body but as this has been done before by Mr LANDEN I shall take it for granted here VOL LXXX Z z z P R O530 Mr WILDBORE on P R O P O S I T I O N VII If a body of any form revolve in any manner whatsoever with its centre of gravity at rest in

2 conic532 Mr WILDBORE on conic sections is insufficient for determining the motion of the body with respect to absolute space because at present nothing is found but the relations of inertiae and velocities In order to determine a point which can be considered as at rest in absolute space and the nature of the bodys motion with respect to it let Z fig 8 be such a point absolutely at rest itself but so as to be always touched by the moving spherical surface which revolves with the body Or it is the same thing to consider it as a given point upon a concave spherical surface at rest surrounding and every where touching that supposed above to revolve with the body Through this point Z suppose quadrantal arcs Al Bm and Cn to be drawn from the poles of the three permanent axes and consequently perpendicular to the three sides of the octant ABC supposing also Z to be at the instant over some point of this octant and that a is greater than b and b than c when the velocity of the

proving itself Hence we gain a clear idea of the motion of the body during the time that the octant ABC takes in passing under Z beginning at some point V in CB or in AB as the case may happen and ending at some point W in CA that is the point Z enters the octant when V touches Z and quits it at W the motion of the body or spherical surface that revolves with it under Z being in the sense from W towards V that is W approaching the fixed point Z whilst V recedes from it And since both the directions and velocities of the poles A B and C in absolute space are given above their tracks also may

motion can never begin at B nor can the pole opposite to B ever come under Z And the reason of this is also evident from the nature of the motion itself for these being poles of a permanent axis if Z were once over one of them it must always con tinue so Having thus determined the time velocity and manner in which the spherical surface that revolves with the body passes under the fixed point Z it only remains to determine the path of one of the poles as C of the permanent axes about Z in absolute space or upon a spherical surface at rest but equal and concentric with that supposed to move with the body for the path of one of these poles as C being found those of the other two and indeed the path of every other in variable point of the moving spherical surface becomes known Now the velocity

distance of C from Z at the end of any time t there is then only wanting the angle described by C about Z corresponding to the distance CZ therefrom to have the path of C about Z which may be found by the help of quadratures as follows As s ZC velocity of C perpendicular to ZC found above x x cos AZ  y x cos BZs ZC 1 the angular velocity of C about Z  x x cos AZ  y x cos BZs ZC2 which velocity

has been proved that then C2 is greater than A2 consequently O crosses BC between V and C in fig 8 and both O and Z quit the octant ABC at the same instant Z at W and O between W and C at the point where 2  0 and 2  n2  2e2 and as will be more fully shewn a great circle drawn from O to Z being always perpendicular to the track VZW In the very same manner it may be shewn that when A2 is greater than C2 and the track which passes under Z 2 crosses550 Mr WILDBORE on crosses BA both O and Z still enter the octant ABC together both pass over it in the same time and both quit it or cross CA together but in this case the track for Z upon the moving surface is less than or within that of O Z crossing BA at a point nearer to A than that where O crosses it and O in both these cases shifts its place on the moving spherical surface making one revolution in the time that the whole curve WVWV takes in passing under Z both curves being such that in the cases above descibed where the projection of WVWV is a conic section that of the track of O projected upon the same plane will be a conic section also that is where it is shewn above that the projection of WVWV is an hyperbola that of the track O will be an hyperbola and an ellipsis where that of the other is an ellipsis And when A2  C2 or 2 2  A C  2 2 the track of O as well as Z is a great circle of the sphere since 22  CA and

greater than c2 the sine of CW must be greater than s CQ or than s CO when O crosses CA and therefore the point where O crosses CA must be nearer C than the point where Z crosses it the same instant in the case where both the tracks are great circles of the sphere passing through the same point B 2 It is now well known that the momentum of inertia of the body round the axis whose pole is O is  Ma22  Mb22  Mc22 and if this be drawn into 2 the product M2 x a22  bSpherical Motion 551 b22  c22  M x a2x2  b2y2  c2z  the whole vis viva of the body or because radius is unity it is  the centrifugal motive force of the body round the natural or momentary axis which being equal to the sum of Ma2x2 Mb2y2 and Mc2z2 those round the three permanent ones and being above proved to be a constant quantity the perturbating motive forces M x b2  c2 x yz M x c2  a2 x zx and M x a2  b2  xy above found cannot alter the vis viva or whole motive force of the body along the midcircle or that which is 90o from O But for a more particular proof of this let these oblique pertur bating motive forces be resolved into three others acting in the direction of the midcircle the first so resolved being  M x b2  c2 x yz  M2  x b2  c2 the second  M2  x c2  a2 and the third  M2  x a2  b2 their sum M2  x b2  c2  c2  a2  a2  b2 being  0 shews that there is no motive force in the direction of the midcircle arising from them wherefore that along the midcircle must remain unaltered But though there is no perturbating motive force in the direction of the midcircle there is nevertheless an accelerative one acting along it for the three perturbating accelerative forces round the three permanent axes being b2  c2a2 x yz c2  a2b2 x zx and a2  b2c2 x xy these being resolved into the direction of the midcircle their sum 2  x b2  c2a2  c2  a2b2  a2  b2c2  2  x 1A  1B  1C will not be  0 but to 2 ABC which is the value of t found in the preceding scholium and by the gene ral properties of all spherical motion as proved in the fourth proposition above is the accelerating force acting there This552 Mr WILDBORE on This matter M EULER considers in a somewhat different light by finding the initial axis or that about which if the body were perfectly at rest it would be first urged to turn by accelerating forces acting upon it and from Scholium I Prop IV above it appears that if the body were at rest and acted upon by three external accelerating forces xt yt and zt it would be urged to turn the first instant about some axis whose pole is E by a single force  x2  y2  z2t such that the five forces x2  y2  z2t xt yt zt and t will be respectively as radius cos EA cos EB cos EC and cos EO or xt x cos EA  yt x cosEB  zt x cos EC  t x cos EO and since when the body is in motion and that motion disturbed by the unequal action of its own particles which generates accelerating forces such forces considered simply in themselves must still have the same ten dency to turn the body about some axis whose pole is E dif ferent from that whose pole is O and such that the above equation may still obtain and if the abovefound values of xt yt and zt be substituted therein by means of a calculus so instituted the

that there is any one point upon the varying great circle ZOY which in general continues always the same or invariable upon the moving spherical surface to find therefore the path of O about Z in absolute space it is necessary to consider that the point O where soever upon the spherical surface it is found can have but one proper direction of motion and velocity with which it shifts its place those therefore in absolute space and on the moving surface must necessarily be the same and consequently the two tracks viz that on the moving surface and that on the fixed one or about Z in absolute

all constant quantities in all possible cases notwithstanding the irregularity of the bodys motion which is a property very remarkable 4 If 1A here be  0  b2c2a2 and b2  c2 or the two less momenta of

than the 125th part of a second and the whole diurnal nutation less than the 5 Indeed the 113th partSpherical Motion 557 part of a second must be very near the true quantity for though the earths figure may not be precisely that of a spheroid it cannot differ from it so much as to make any sensible altera tion in this especially now it appears from the foregoing ge neral solution that the angular velocity about the axis whose pole is Z is always uniform and constant let the figure of the revolving body be what it will Neither can the progressive or annual motion cause any alteration because it cannot at all affect the rotatory or diurnal one 5 The remarkable property mentioned at the end of the 3d of these general scholia may be more particularly expressed thus as the s Zq  mb2y

circle being at the distance of 90o from Z the angular ve locity of the body round the axis at rest in absolute space whose pole is Z will be always equable uniform and constant not withstanding the other oscillating vacillating motions of the body e being the greatest angular velocity about the mo mentary axis This motion then is of the most simple and evident kind and together with that of the track under Z above deter mined limits the whole compound motion under considera tion all the others being only necessary consequences of these so558 Mr WILDBORE on so that after all the pains bestowed upon the problem the result is as simple as could be wished for and the motion though not quite so regular is as easy to be conceived as that in the particular case of the solids of revolution For the spherical surface concentric with the body moves with an uniform and constant angular velocity V about an axis IZ at rest in absolute space whilst the track WVWV upon that surface always passes Z the pole of that axis with a velocity   b422B2 X a42  c42  y2AC which though not constant recovers its first value again and again in equal times as the body revolves for ever 6 I shall only just add that if P Q and R be any three external motive forces supposed to act upon the body in the directions of the three great circles BC CA and AB then must PMa2  xt  b2  c2a2 X yz QMb2  yt  c2  a2b2 X zx and RMc2  zt  a2  b2c2 X xy express the values of the external accelerating forces that act upon the body to alter its velocity about the three permanent axes of rotation And when the relations of those external forces to the internal perturbating ones are given a solution will hence be obtained to the more general problem for determining the motion of the body when besides the pertur bation arising from the centrifugal force of its own particles it is also acted upon by any external disturbing forces what ever And if P Q and R be equal to but in contrary di rections to Myz

Spherical Motion 559 Note referred to in page 519 C Without any regard to the parallelopipedon let the form of the body be what it will if the momenta of inertia round the three permanent axes be represented by Maa Mbb and Mcc the relative motive forces round those axes will always be ex pressed by Ma2x2 Mb2y2 and Mc2z2 acting at the distance of radius therefrom And then in fig 7 the

REV CHARLES WILDBORE COMMUNICATED BY EARL STANHOPE F R S READ JUNE 24 1790 THIS PAPER WHICH HAS COST ME MUCH PAINS IN PATIENT INVESTIGATION IS OCCASIONED BY THAT OF MR LANDEN IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL LXXV PART II I AM NO STRANGER TO THIS GENTLEMANS GREAT JUDGEMENT AND ABILITIES IN THESE ABSTRUSE SPECULATIONS BUT HAVE A VERY HIGH OPINION OF BOTH YET I COULD NOT BUT THINK IT STRANGE THAT TWO SUCH MA THEMATICIANS AS M DALEMBERT AND M L EULER SHOULD BOTH FOLLOW ONE ANOTHER ON THE SAME SUBJECT BOTH AGREE AND STILL NOT BE RIGHT I THEREFORE RESOLVED TO TRY TO DIVE TO THE BOTTOM OF THEIR SOLUTIONS WHICH THOSE WHO ARE ACQUAINTED WITH THE SUBJECT KNOW TO BE NO LIGHT TASK AND IF POSSIBLE TO GIVE THE SOLUTION INDEPENDENT OF THE PERPLEXING CONSIDERATION OF A MOMENTARY AXIS CHANGING ITS PLACE BOTH IN THE BODY AND IN ABSOLUTE SPACE EVERY INSTANT AND WHICH I LOOK UPON AS NOT AB SOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE BODYS MOTION BUT FINDING THAT I COULD NOT THUS SO READILY SHEW THE AGREE MENT OR DISAGREEMENT OF MY CONCLUSIONS WITH THOSE OF THE GEN TLEMEN WHO HAVE PRECEDED ME IN THIS ENQUIRY I HAVE ALSO ADDED THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF THIS AXIS AND I SUPPOSE IT WILL BE FOUND THAT I HAVE ADDED MANY PROPERTIES UNKNOWN BEFORE OR AT LEAST UNNOTICED BY ANY OF THEM M LANDENS20 30 40 50 60 THE SEVEN SATELLITES OF APPEARED TO BE SITUATED THE 18 AT 7H 51 54 1789

EVERY BODY BE ITS FORM EVER SO IRREGULAR WILL REVOLVE IN THE SAME MANNER AS IF ITS MASS WERE EQUALLY DIVIDED AND PLACED IN THE EIGHT ANGLES OR DISPOSED IN THE EIGHT OCTANTS OF A REGULAR PARALLELO PIPEDON WHOSE MOMENTS OF INERTIA ROUND ITS THREE PERMANENT AXES ARE THE SAME AS THOSE OF THE BODY SERVES ADMIRABLY TO SHORTEN THE INVESTIGATION AND RENDER THE SOLUTION PERSPICUOUS I HAVE THEREFORE HERE TAKEN ITS TRUTH FOR GRANTED BECAUSE IT IS ALSO EXACTLY AGREEABLE TO THE SOLUTIONS OF THE OTHER GENTLEMEN AND SAVES THE TROUBLE OF REPEATING WHAT THEY HAVE DONE BEFORE I HAVE ALSO SHEWN WHEREIN AND WHY HIS SOLUTION DIFFERS FROM THEIRS AND PROVED AS I THINK UNDENIABLY IN WHAT RESPECTS IT IS DEFECTIVE THAT THE INERTIA OR AS M EULER CALLS IT THE MOMENTUM OF INERTIA IS EQUAL TO THE FLUENT OR SUM OF EVERY PARTICLE OF THE BODY DRAWN INTO THE SQUARE OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE AXIS OF MOTION AND THE DETERMINATION OF THE THREE PERMANENT AXES OR THE DEMONSTRATION THAT THERE ARE AT LEAST THREE SUCH AXES IN EVERY BODY ROUND ANY ONE OF WHICH IF IT REVOLVED THE VELO CITY WOULD BE FOR EVER UNIFORM I HAVE ALSO TAKEN FOR GRANTED BECAUSE THESE THINGS HAVE BEEN PROVED BEFORE AND ALL THE GEN TLEMEN ARE AGREED IN THEM DIFFICULTIES THAT OCCURRED I HAVE NOT CONCEALED BUT SHEWN HOW TO OBVIATE AND ENDEAVOURED TO PLACE THE TRUTH IN AS CLEAR A LIGHT AS POSSIBLE WHICH TO DISCO VER IS MY WISH OR TO WELCOME

REVOLVES THE DISTANCES SP AND SP ALWAYS CONTINUE INVARIABLE THE VELOCITY OF THE POINT P IN THE CIRCLE HPS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE PERIPHERY OF THE CIRCLE ITSELF MUST BE EQUAL TO THAT OF S AND S AND IS THEREFORE THE VELOCITY OF EVERY POINT OF THIS CIRCLE ALONG ITS OWN PERIPHERY COROLLARY 1 HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT IN WHATSOEVER MANNER A GLOBE REVOLVES ITS VELOCITY MEASURED ON THE SAME GREAT CIRCLE ON ITS SURFACE MUST BE THE SAME AT THE SAME TIME AT EVERY POINT OF THE PERIPHERY OF THAT CIRCLE COROLLARY 2 CONSEQUENTLY HOWSOEVER THE PLANE OF A GREAT CIRCLE VARIES ITS MOTION THE VELOCITY AT ANY

RIGHTANGLED AT P AND A AQ RIGHTANGLED AT A MAY BE CONSIDERED AS PLANE ONES AND ARE THEREFORE SIMILAR AND SINCE THE ANGLES PAQ AND QAA ARE BOTH RIGHT ONES TAKING AWAY QAP WHICH IS COMMON THE ANGLES PAA

TRACKS OF THESE POINTS ARE  CIRCLES OF THE SPHERE WHOSE RADII ARE THOSE DISTANCES AND SO LONG AS THE VELOCITIES A B AND C ARE INVARIABLE THE POINTS Q R AND S WHICH ARE ALWAYS AT THE SAME DISTANCES 3 FROMSPHERICAL MOTION 503 FROM B C AND A MUST BE ALWAYS AT THE SAME DISTANCES FROM O THAT IS OR OS AND OQ ARE CONSTANT AND THE POINT O AT REST AND THIS MUST ALSO BE THE CASE IF A B AND C BE VARIABLE PROVIDED THEY HAVE THE SAME CONSTANT RATIO AMONGST THEMSELVES COROLLARY HENCE THE POINTS Q R AND S ARE THE NODES OF THE GREAT CIRCLES CQA ARB AND BSC SCHOLIUM THE DEMONSTRATION OF THIS PROPOSITION BEING THUS STRICTLY GIVEN SOME NOTION MAY BE OBTAINED OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THE POINT O VARIES ITS PLACE UPON THE SPHERICAL SURFACE WHEN THE VELOCITIES ALONG THE CIRCLES AB BC AND CA ARE VA RIABLE THUS LET SUCH SPHERICAL SURFACE SO REVOLVING RECEIVE AN INSTANTANEOUS IMPULSE AT THE DISTANCE OF A QUADRANT OR 90O FROM S IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF THE GREAT CIRCLE CSB THEN THE CENTRE OF THE SPHERE MAY BE KEPT AT REST BY AN EQUAL AND CONTRARY IMPULSE AT THIS CENTRE AND SINCE BY HYPOTHESIS THE IMPULSE IS GIVEN 90O FROM S AND IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF THE GREAT CIRCLE CSB IT CAN NEI THER ALTER THE PLACE OF THE NODE S UPON THE CIRCLE NOR THE VE LOCITY IN THE DIRECTION OF ITS PERIPHERY BUT ONLY THOSE IN AB AND CA THUS IF THE VELOCITY IN BA WHICH BEFORE WAS  C BE NOW EQUAL TO Z THEN AS S SB Z S SC THE VELOCITY ALONG CA LET THIS  Y WHILST STILL THE VELOCITY ALONG CB CON TINUES AS BEFORE  A AND THIS WILL CAUSE THE POINT O TO FALL UPON ANOTHER POINT OF

ALTERED HENCE THEN IF INSTEAD OF AN INSTANTANEOUS IM PULSE A MOTIVE FORCE BE SUPPOSED TO ACT IN THE SAME DIRECTION AND MEASURED AT THE SAME POINT WHERE THE IMPULSE WAS JUST NOW SUPPOSED TO ACT SUCH FORCE CAN NEITHER VARY THE POINT S NOR THE VELOCITY A BUT WILL IN TIME VARY B AND C AND CAUSE THE POINT O TO ALTER ITS PLACE IN SA AND THUS THE VELOCITIES B AND C WILL VARY TO Y AND Z AND E   A2  B2

NOT AT ALL AFFECTED IN EXPRESSION BY THESPHERICAL MOTION 509 THE VARIATION OF E BUT ARE DENOTED BY THE SAME QUANTITIES WHETHER E BE CONSTANT OR VARIABLE WHICH CONCLUSION AND ALSO THE VALUES OF THE FORCES THEMSELVES IS PERFECTLY AGREEABLE TO WHAT IS BROUGHT OUT BY MR LANDEN BY A METHOD SO VERY DIFFERENT IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1777 BUT IT IS HERE CAREFULLY TO BE NOTED THAT THESE ARE NOT MOTIVE FORCES BUT ACCELERATIVE ONES FOR NO NOTICE WHATEVER IS YET TAKEN OF THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE OF THE REVOLVING GLOBE BUT THE EXPRESSIONS HOLD TRUE BE THAT STRUCTURE WHAT IT WILL IF IT BE SUCH THAT ONE AND THE SAME QUANTITY DRAWN INTO EACH ACCELE RATING FORCE WILL GIVE THE CORRESPONDENT MOTIVE ONE THEN ARE THE MOTIVE FORCES PROPORTIONAL TO THE ACCELERATIVE ONES BUT OTHERWISE NOT IT MAY HERE ALSO BE OBSERVED THAT IT IS QUITE CONFORMABLE TO NATURE THAT THESE ACCELERATING FORCES SHOULD BE EXPRESSED BY THE SAME QUANTITIES WHETHER E BE CONSTANT OR VA RIABLE FOR THESE FORCES ACTING AT THE POLE OF THE NATURAL AXIS CANNOT POSSIBLY HAVE ANY EFFECT UPON THE VELOCITY ROUND IT BUT IT IS NOT HENCE BY ANY MEANS TO BE CONCLUDED THAT THE VELO CITY ABOUT THE AXIS IS THEREFORE CONSTANT BECAUSE THESE ARE NOT IN GENERAL THE ONLY ACCELERATING FORCES THAT ACT UPON THE BODY BUT THERE IS ALSO A THIRD ACCELERATING FORCE WHOSE VALUE IS ET ARISING FROM THE DIFFERENT VARIABILITY OF X Y AND Z AND WHICH CANNOT VANISH EXCEPT X  Y  Z  0 IT THEREFORE CAN ONLY VANISH IN PARTICULAR CASES IF THE EQUATION E  X  Y  Z BE SQUARED THERE WILL THENCE ARISE AFTER DUE ORDERING E2  X2  Y2  Z2  E2 X   2    2

OF THE FORCES ROUND THE AXES WHOSE POLES ARE A B AND C MOREOVER BY THE GENERAL LAWS OF ALL MOTION GT  GT AND 222T2 ARE THE VELOCITIES WITH WHICH THE POLE OF THE MO MENTARY AXIS SHIFTS ITS PLACE IN DIRECTIONS PERPENDICULAR TO BO ALONG BO AND ALONG ITS OWN TRACK ON THE SURFACE RESPEC CTIVELY AND IT IS BY TAKING THE FLUXIONS OF THESE AND DIVIDING EACH FLUXION BY THAT OF THE TIME THAT THE ACCE LERATING FORCES ARE HAD WHICH ARE DUE TO SUCH ALTERATION OF PLACE OF THE MOMENTARY POLE AND THESE MUST BY NO MEANS BE CONFOUNDED WITH THE FORCES BEFORE FOUND  EGT AND EGT X    IN THOSE DIRECTIONS THESE LAST PERTAINING TO THE TENDENCY OF THE SURFACE ITSELF TO MOTION AT O AND THE OTHERS TO THE SHIFTING OF THE POLE OF THE AXIS UPON THE SURFACE WHICH ARE DIFFERENT MOTIONS AS WILL MORE CLEARLY APPEAR FROM WHAT FOLLOWS THE PRECEDING GENERAL PROPERTIES OF MOTION OBTAIN IN ALL BODIES REVOLVING ROUND A CENTER AT REST BE THEIR MOTION EVER SO IRREGULAR THE THREE GREAT CIRCLES BOUNDING AN OCTANT

THE THREE PERMANENT AXES BUT THEN BESIDES THE PERTURBATING FORCE ARISING FROM THE MOTION OF THE BODY ABOUT EACH OF THE THREE AXES WHOSE POLES ARE IN THE NODES OF THE GREAT CIRCLES BOUNDING SUCH OCTANT THERE WILL PERTAINING TO EACH CIRCLE BE ANOTHER PERTURBATING FORCE ARISING FROM THE NONEQUILIBRIUM OF THE PARTICLES OF THE BODY IN MOTION IN PLANES PARALLEL TO THE PLANE OF EACH CIRCLE WHICH BEING

THE PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM OF THE PARTICLES IN MOTION ROUND THEM THEIR PROPERTY BEING SUCH THAT IF THE BODY BEGIN TO MOVE SIMPLY ROUND ONE OF THEM IT MUST UNIFORMLY CON TINUE SO TO DO FOR EVER AND IF AS

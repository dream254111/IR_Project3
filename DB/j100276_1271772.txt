j100276,Michigan Law Review,1271772,Inconsistent Defenses,i254449,MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW States protects rights of property as it does the right to life and liberty and that the duty of the judiciary is to enforce this protection I fail to see what it is I suppose that in every civilized state the laws protect rights in property and the judges enforce these laws The only difference is that in our consti tutions we have statutes not so easily changed as the laws of most nations There is nothing in the constitution of the United States which is intended to set off property owners as a class by themselves as against others or which gives them greater or different protection than is accorded to others It is possible to conceive the owners of property as one class and those who have no property as another but this is equally true in all nations But surely the democracy is not to be conceived as only those who have no property It is probable that the great majority of the citizens of the United States have some property Do they therefore not belong to the democracy The evil of such statements is that however intended they tend to empha size a division between the rich and the poor not based on fact and hence to stir up feeling among the latter There are no classes of rich and poor in this country Those who are today rich may become poor tomorrow and the poor are often becoming rich The constitutional provisions protecting rights in property are for the benefit of all since every man either has or may reasonably expect to have property and the possessions of a poor man are as dear to him as the greater abundance of the rich That the protection of property is one of the governmental functions recog nized as important in all civilized states it is hardly necessary to say Its recognition in the fifth amendment is in form as well as in substance as old as Magna Charta Its recognition in the fourteenth amendment does no more than extend to the rights of life liberty and property the protection of the federal government against state aggression The great distinction between this government and that of England in this regard is that here the funda mental rights of the individual to life liberty and property being guaranteed by written constitutions against deprivation otherwise than by due process of law have the protection of the courts against legislative as well as other encroachment Detroit Oct 27 1909 C A KENT INCONSISTENT DEFENSESThe vexed question of the right to rely upon inconsistent defenses is still unsettled The conflict in the cases continues Light v Stevens I908 Cal App  103 Pac 361 and Postal Telegraph Cable Co of Texas v Harriss I909  Tex Civ App  121 S W 358 assert the right Fetzer  Co v Williams I909  Kan  IO3 Pac 77 denies it In the California case it was claimed that the contention that cer tain drafts were intended to apply as payment on account of a promissory note was untenable under the allegation in the pleading that these drafts were received for the use and benefit of a party upon a promise and agreement to return them in the Texas case that although the plaintiff in his replication stated the facts substantially as set up in the answer in which defendant pleaded a contract alleged to limit its liability to its own line he could claim at the trial that the liability of the defendant was not so limited and that 134NOTE AND COMMENT said contract was a through contract in the Kansas case that the defendant had rescinded a contract of purchase and that he had affirmed it The decisions in California and Texas are in line with the former cases in those states the one in Kansas does not follow the suggestion made in De Lissa v Coal Co 59 Kan 319 where the court said It would seem that an objection to defenses in an answer upon the ground of their inconsistency with each other could never be sustained and quoted with apparent approval the following from POMEROYS CODE REMEDIES Assuming that the defenses are utterly inconsistent the rule is established by an overwhelming weight of authority that unless expressly prohibited by the statute they may still be united in one answer and where the court also said that practically the only dissent from the rule thus stated by Pomeroy was by the courts of Minne sota and Missouri The present state of the authorities does not justify Mr Pomeroy and many states other than those of Minnesota and Missouri must be added to the dissenting list and among them Kansas itself The case of Derby v Gallup 5 Minn 85 is one of the earliest cases upon the question under the code system of pleading It was decided nearly fifty years ago I86o and is a well reasoned case The action was trover for the taking and conversion of certain personal property the possession and own ership of which were claimed by plaintiff The answer was a denial of every allegation in the complaint and also an allegation by way of additional defense that the goods described in the complaint belonged to a third person and that defendant had taken them on a writ duly issued against such third person The court below instructed the jury that under the pleadings the taking was admitted and the corectness of this instruction came on for hearing before the Supreme Court and the case was affirmed Although Mr Pomeroy was of the opinion that the weight of authority was overwhelmingly the other way he admits that the reasoning in this case by ATWATER J was very able and difficult to be answered upon principle Among the more recent cases in which the question has been fully consid ered is that of Seattle National Bank v Carter 13 Wash 28I It was a suit upon promissory notes The answer denied that the plaintiff was the owner and holder of the notes or that they had been indorsed and delivered to it for a valuable consideration and also alleged affirmatively the transfer of the notes to plaintiff and that they had been paid The court below charged the jury that under the pleading the only question for consideration was the payment of the notes Plaintiff obtained a verdict and the case was taken to the Supreme Court the issue there being stated by that court as follows But as the question of inconsistent defenses is raised squarely in this case and has been argued with much zeal and ability by the attorneys on both sides we have concluded to enter upon an investigation of that question and settle the law so far as this state is concerned on that proposition In its opinion the court quotes the rule laid down by Pomeroy analyzes the cases cited by him in support of the same and reaches the conclusion that he was unwarranted in making the assertion that the rule he announced was established by an overwhelming weight of judicial authority or any weight of authority at all under the code procedure and declined to follow it saying that its I35MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW theory carried to its logical result would permit a defendant who was sued upon a promissory note to allege nonexecution want of consideration and payment Under such allegations he would be permitted to swear that he never executed the note that he did execute the note but that it was without consideration and that he did execute the note that the consideration was good but that he had paid the same Such a practice as this would not only be farcical but absolutely wrong and immoral and an encouragement of perjury     The ruling of the court below was sustained Bell v Brown 22 Cal 678 and Buhne v Corbett 43 Cal 264 are leading cases in that state asserting and enforcing the right to plead inconsistent defenses In the former case the court below sustained a motion that defend ants be required to elect between the defense of the denial of the plaintiffs title and possession and the defense of voluntary abandonment and forfeiture by reason of noncompliance with mining regulations In reversing the case the Supreme Court referring to the code provision that the defendant may set forth as many defenses as he may have said This section applies to all answers verified and unverified It does not attempt to make any distinction between the two or to make any rule which does not apply equally to both The right to set up numerous defenses in a suit is equally as important to the defendant in one case as in the other It is an absolute right given him by law and the principle is as old as the common law itself He may fail to prove one defense by reason of the loss of papers absence death or want of recollection of a witness and yet he ought not thereby to be precluded from proving another equally sufficient to defeat the action In many cases it would be a denial of justice if a defendant should be shut out from setting up several defenses In Buhne v Corbett the complaint alleged ownership of certain premises and that defendants entered into and unlawfully held possession of the same The answer denied the entry and the withholding of possession and by way of further defense alleged that the defendants were in charge of the lighthouse on the premises as employees of the United States At the trial the plaintiff was nonsuited on the ground that he had not shown possession by the defendants his position being that he was relieved from the necessity of doing so under the averments of the answer The case was appealed and the Supreme Court in affirming the judgment of nonsuit cited Bell v Brown and said But even had he by motion presented the question of the supposed inconsistency of the several defenses in the answer we think it could not have availed him A party defendant in pleading may plead as many defenses as he may have If a plea or defense separately pleaded in an answer contains several matters these should not be repugnant or incon sistent in themselves But the plea or defense regarded as an entirety if it be otherwise sufficient in point of form or substance is not to be defeated or disregarded merely because it is inconsistent with some other plea or defense pleaded The statement of the court in Bell v Brown supra that the right of the defendant in a suit to set up numerous defenses is an absolute right given him by law and the principle is as old as the common law itself calls for some comment The strict rule of the common law was that a defendant 136NOTE AND COMMENT could plead only one defense to the same cause of action To do otherwise would violate the rule against duplicity This rule requiring him to choose one defense only where he had several it frequently happened that he failed to select the strongest and the rule came to be regarded as a harsh one This led to the enactment of the statute of 4 Anne which provided that it should be lawful for any defendant    in any action or suit    in any court of record with leave of court to plead as many several matters thereto as he shall think necessary for his defense This left the matter to the dis cretion of the court At first it seems that the judges would refuse leave when inconsistent pleas were tendered but subsequently granted it in all cases perhaps but those of general issue and tender It appears therefore that at common law the question of inconsistent pleas could not arise that under the statute of Anne the matter was wholly within discretion of the court when leave to file them was asked and that the practice finally obtained of allowing them in nearly all cases T A B VACATION OF CORPORATION DIRECTORSIn the case of Kavanaugh v The Commonwealth Trust Company decided by the Supreme Court of Sara toga County New York in September I909 VAN KIRK J rules upon some novel points relating to the duties of directors of trust companies in prevent ing the wasting of corporate assets The suit was brought by a shareholder to recover into the treasury of the trust company a sum of money as dam ages suffered by the loss of funds through the alleged negligence of the directors The loss occurred through the connection of the trust company then the Trust Company of the Republicwith the failure of that famous artistic swindle the United States Shipbuilding Company in I903 The trust company was organized in March I902 with Ioooooo capital stock 500000 surplus and a directorate that stood for strength and probity in the world of finance to operate largely in the new and lucrative field of meeting the needs of the southern cottongrowers Mr Dresser a merchant son of a merchant married into the Vanderbilt family but with no experi ence in high finance was chosen president About this time John W Young a promoter of projects of unvarying failure and Lewis Nixon the designer of the Oregon with the prospect of large ship subsidies from the probably successful efforts of Senators Frye and Hanna in congress dreamed of a shipbuilding trust to include the prin cipal shipbuilders of the country acquired options therefor and proposed to form a company to take them over The plan required about 8oo0ooo

Young and Nixons dream took on the appearance of established fact to Mr Dresser and the directors of the trust company and they agreed to issue the prospectus of the Ship Com pany and secure the

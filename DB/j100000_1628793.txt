a statement showing the increasing age of the population from decade to decade The median age of the total population in 1900 was 228 as com pared with 219 in 1890 The median age of the white population in the last census year was 234 and the colored including Negroes Indians and Mongolians was 197 while in 1890 that of the white population was 224 and the colored 183 The report shows that there was an increase in the median age of the white population in each decade from 1810 to 1890 amounting in the ninety years to 74 years The statement says Many complex influences have cooperated in producing as a resultant this steady change in the age composition of N S VOL XVI NO 402 the population Three may be mentioned the rapid progress of medical and sanitary sci ence which has tended to increase the aver age length of life the decrease in the relative number of children born which has made the earlier age periods less preponderant numer ically in the total population and the influx especially since 1840 of great numbers of adult immigrants increasing the number in the older age periods The Medical News gives an account of the Pathological Museum established by Professor Virchow at Berlin which con tains 23066 preparations A similar institute does not exist in the world and the well known and doubtless as prominent Musee Depuytren in Paris in comparison with Virchows creation is but a fragment How completely throughout and in what minute de tail the pathological museum has been planned can be seen by the fact that besides the apart ments for the director assistants and drafts man microphotographic rooms have been built workrooms provided for the mounting of preparations and their temporary conserva tion and even a bathroom furnished for the laboratory attendants Selfdependent as in certain respects this new pathological mu seum is it yet stands in organic and local connection with the pathological institute which like the whole Hospital of the Charite will be remodeled in compliance with modern demands and will also in a short time be re built in new and more splendid form Besides the relation which exists between the patho logical institute and the clinical divisions of the hospital because the necropsies are per formed there various physical clinical and bacteriological sections will be added separ ately in the new institute for scientific pur poses THE Journal of the American Medical As sociation gives the following statistics in re gard to students in the United States One hundred and fiftysix medical colleges with 6776 instructors enrolled 27501 students and graduated 5002 students in the school year 19012 In the year previous 19001 156 colleges with 5958 teachers enrolled 26417SCIENCE students and graduated 5444 Twenty years ago there were 89 medical schools with 14934 students and 4115 graduates The increase in the number of schools and students is far in advance of the increase in the number of graduates The graduates twenty years ago were 4115 in 1900 5314 in 1901 5444 and in 1902 5000 The attendance in twenty years has therefore increased nearly 200 per cent and the number of graduates has in creased less than 25 per cent The decrease in the number of graduates in the last year is assigned to the increased length of course of study and increased requirements by state boards It is considered by many a temporary decrease and one that will be changed to an increase as soon as the temporary check is overcome The decrease in graduates is classi fied thus There were 4879 graduates from the regular colleges in 1901 387 from the homeopathic 148 from the eclectic and 30 from the physiomedical and nondescript total 5444 In 1902 4498 graduated from regular schools 336 from the homeopathic 138 from the eclectic and 27 from the others a decrease in every class The increase in students is classified thus There were 23846 students registered at the regular colleges during the year ending July 1 1901 1683 at the homeopathic 664 at the eclectic and 224 at the physiomedical and nondescript a to tal of 26417 During the year ending July 1 1902 24878 students registered at the regu lar colleges 1617 at the homeopathic 765 at the eclectic and 241 at the physiomedical and nondescript total 27501 This is an in crease among all but the homeopathic schools In the year the regular schools increased in enrolment 1032 and decreased in number of graduates 381 The homeopaths lost in en rolment 66 and in graduates 51 the eclectics gained in enrolment 99 and lost 10 in gradu ates all other schools gained

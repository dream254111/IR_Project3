formances about Optickglasses In the abovementioned French Tract there is also contained M Auzouts Opinion of what he had found New in the Treatise of Signor Campani which was spoken of in the first Papers of these Transactions concerning both the Effect of the Telescopes contrived after a peculiar way by the said Campani at Rome and his71 his New Observations of Saturn and Jupiter made by means thereof First therefore after that M Auzout had raised some scruple against the Contrivance of Signor Campani for making Great OptickGlasses without Moulds by the means of a Turnlath he examines the Observations made with such Glasses Where having commended Campanis sincerity in relating what he thought to have seen in Saturn without accomodating it to M Hugenss Hy pothesis he affirms that supposing there be a Ring about Saturn Signor Campani could not see in all those different times that he observed it the same Appearances which he notes to have actual ly secn For having seen it sometimes in Trine Aspect with the Sun and Oriental sometimes in the same Aspect but Occidental sometimes in Sextil Aspect and Occidental at another time again in Trine and Oriental this Author cannot conceive how Saturn could in all these different times have no difference in its Phasis or keep always the same Shadow seeing that according to the Hypothesis of the Ring when it was Oriental it must cast the Shad dow upon the left side of the Ring beneath without casting any on the right side and when it was Occidental it could not but cast it on the right side beneath and nothing of it on the other Concerning the Shadow above which Campani affirms to be made by the king upon the Body of Saturn M Auzout judges that there could be no such Phaenomenon by reason of its Northern Latitude at the times wherein the Observations were made vid in April 1663 in the midst of August and the beginning of October next following and in April 1664 except it were in October and the Shadow strong enough to become visible But as to the Shadow below he agrees with Campani that it does appear yet not as he notes it seeing that it must be some times on the one side sometimes on the other and towards the Quadrat with the Sun it must appear biggest as indeed he affirms to have seen it himself this year insomuch that sometimes it seemed to him that it covered the whole Ring and that the Shad dow joyning with the obscure space between both did interrupt the circumference of the Ring but beholding it at other times in a cleer Sky and when there was no Trepidation of the Air K 2 he72 he thought that he saw also the Light continued from without although very slender But he acknowledges that he could ne ver yet precisely determine by how much the largeness of the Ring was bigger than the Diameter of Saturns Body As for the proportion of the Length to the Breadth he affirms to have al waies estimated it to be two and a half or very neer so and to have found in his Observations that in January last one time the length of Saturn was 12 Lines and the breadth 5 Another time the length was 12 Lines and the breadth 4 and this by a peculi ar method of his own But yet he acknowleges also that some times he hath estimated it as 7 to 3 and at other times as 1310 5 and that if there do not happen a change in the magnitude of the Ring as it is not likely there does that must needs proceed from the Constitution of the air or of the Glasss having more or less Aperture or from the difficulty of making an exact estimate of their proportions However it is not much wide saith he of two and an half although Campani make the length of the Ring but double to its breadth Monsieur Auzout believes that he was one of the first that have well observed this shadow of Saturns Body upon its Ring s which he affirms happened two years since when observing in July for the first time with a Telescope of 21 and then another of 27 foot he perceived that the Angle of the obscure space on the right side beneath was bigger and wider than the three other Angles and that some interruption appeard there between the Ring and the Body of Saturn of which he saith to have given notice from that time to all his friends and in particular as soon as conveniently he could to Monsieur Hugens He consesseth that he hath not had the opportunity of obser ving Saturn in his Oriental Quadrat yet he doubts not but that the shadow appears on the Leftside considering that the Exi stence of the Ring can be no longer doubted of after so many Ob servations of the shadow cast by Saturns Body upon it according as it must happen following that Hypothesis there being no reason why it should cast the said shadow on one side and not on the other Concerning the Observation of Jupiter and its satellites the famous Astronomer of Bononia Cassinus having pub lished73 lished that on the 30 day of July 1664 at 2 12 of the clock in the morning he had observd with Campanis Glasses that there passed through the broad obscure Belt of Jupiter two ob scuter spotsby him esteemed to be the shadows of the Satellites moving between Jupiter  the Sunand eclipsing him and emerg ing from the Occidental Brim thereof This Authour did first conceive that they were not shadows but some Sallies or Pro minencies in that Belt which he was induced to believe because he perceived notthat that Prominency which he there saw was so black nor so round as Cassini had represented his spots where fore seeing it but little differing in colour from the Belt and so not judging it roundbecause it did stand only about half its dia meter out of the Belt he persuaded himself that it was rather a Sally or Prominency of the Belt than a round shadowas that of a Satellite of Jupiter must have bin But having been since inform ed of all the Observations made by Cassini and Campani with the New Glasses and seen his Figure he candidly and publickly wisheththat he had not spoken of that Sally or Prominency ad vowing that he can doubt no longerbut that it was the shadow of the Satellit between Jupiter and the Sun having seen the other emerge as soon as with a 20 foot Glass he made the Observati onand having not perceivd these shadows with a 12 foot Glass But although he grants that they did ghess better than heyet he doth it with this proviso vid in case they made that Observati on of July 30 not with their 36 but 12 or 17 foot Telescope If it be wondred at that Monsieur Auzout did not see this sha dow move he allegeth his indisposition for making long Observa tionsand addeththat it may be much more wondred atthat nei ther Campani nor himself did see upon the obscure Belt the Bo dies of the Satellitesas parts more Luminous than the Belt For faith healthough the Latitude was Meridionalit being no more than of 9 or 10minutesthe Body of the Satellites shouldthinks he pass between us and the Belt especially according to Campa niwhomaketh the Belt so largeand puts the shadows farr enough within the same This maketh him conclude that either they have not observed well enoughor that the motion of the Satel lites doth not exactly follow the Belts and is inclind unto them Whereupon he resolvesthat when he shall know that they are to pass between Jupiter and us and to be over against the Belt that then74 then he will observe whether he can see them appear upon the Beltas upon a darker groundespeciallythe third of themwhich is sensibly greaterand more Luminousthan the rest He hopeth also that in time the Shadow of Saturns Moon will be seen upon Saturn although we are yet some years to stay for itand to pre pare also for better Glasses From this rare Observation he inferrs the Proportion of the Diameter of the Satellites to that of Jupiter and judgeth that no longer doubt can be made of the turning of these 4 Satellites or Moons about Jupiter as our Moon turns about the Earth and after the same way as the rest of the Celestial Bodies of our Systeme do movewhence also a strong conjecture may be made that Saturns Moon turns likewise about Saturn Hence he also taketh occasion to intimatethat we need not scruple to conclude that if these two Planets have Moons wheel ing about them as our Earth hath one that moves about it the conformity of theseMoons with ourMoondoes prove the confor mity of our Earth with those Planetswhich carrying away their Moons with themselves do turn about the Sun and very proba bly make their Moons turn about them in turning themselves about their Axis and also that there is no cause to invent per plexd and incredible Hypotheses for the receding from this Analegie since saith he if this be truth the Prohibitions of pub lishing this doctrinewhich formerly were caused by the offence of Noveltywill be laid asideas one of the most zealous Doctors of the contrary Opinion hath given cause to hope witness Eu stachius de Divinis in his Tract against Monsieur Hugens Systeme of Saturn p49 where we are informd that that learned Jesuit PFabry Penitentiary of S Peter in Rome speaks to this purpose  It hath been more than once asked of your Chieftains whether they had a Demonstrati on for asserting the motion of the Earth They durst never yet affirm they bad wherefore no thing binders but that the Church may under stand those Scriptureplaces that speak of this matter in a literal sence and declare they should be so understoodas long as the con trary is not evinced by any demonstration which  Ex vestris iisque Coryphzis non semel quaesitum estutrum aliquam haberent demonstra tionem pro Terrae motu adstru endo Nunquam ausi sunt id afferere N ligitur obstat quin loca illa in sensu literali Eccle sia intelligat  intelligenda esse declaretquamdiu nulla de monstratione contrarium evin75 which if perhaps it should be found out by you which I can hardly believe it wilin this case the Church will not at all scruple to declare that these places are to be understood in a fi gurative and improper sence according to that of the Poet Terraeque Urbesque re cedunt citur quae si fotte aliquando a vobis excogitetur quod vix crediderim in hoc casu nullo modo dubitabit Ecclesia de clarare loca illa in sensu figu rato  improprio intelligenda esse ut illud Poetae Terraeque urbesque recedunt Whence this Author concludes that the said Jesuite assuring us that the inquisition hath not absolutely declaredthat those Scri ptureplaces are to be understood literally seeing that the Church may make a contrary declaration no man ought to scruple to follow the Hypothesis of the Earths motion but only forbear to maintain it in publick till the prohibition be called in But to return to the matter in handthis Authorupon all these observa tions and relations of Cassini and Campani doth find no reason to doubt any more of the excellency of the Glass used by them above his except this difference may be imputed to that of the Air or of the Eys But yet he is rather inclined to ascribe it to the goodness of their Glasses and that the rather because he would not be thought to have the vanity of magnifying his own of which yet he intimates by the by that he caused one to be wrought of 150 Parisian feet which though it pro ved none of the best yet he despairs not to make good ones of that and of far greater Length

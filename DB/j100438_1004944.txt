constituting a Magic Cyclovolute By E Nulty Philadelphia Read before the dmerican Philosophical Society June 27th 1834 THE Magic Circle of Dr Franklin has been long admired as em bracing the most ingenious arrangement of numbers ever formed It consists of five sets of circles of which the first or principal includes nine circumferences bounding eight concentric rings These rings are equally intersected by four diameters or eight radii on which and in the middle of each ring are placed the series of integral numbers from 12 to 75 both inclusive In addition to this series there is an auxiliary 12 occupying the common centre of the rings and the total sixtyfive numbers thus disposed have as respects the eight rings and eight radii the following remarkable properties First The eight numbers round each ring with the auxiliary or central number amount to 360 the number of sexagesimal degrees in a circle Secondly The eight numbers along each radius with the auxiliary number amount to 360 Thirdly The four numbers in each semiring terminating in a principal diameter intermediate between two particular radii with half the auxiliary number form the sum 180 the degrees in a semi circle VOL v3 B206 REM1ARKABLE ARRANGEMENT OF NUMBERS Fourthly Every four adjacent numbers in any two consecutive rings with half the auxiliary number give the same amount 180 As to the four remaining sets of circles and the rings which they form their centres are at the four points in which the principal diam eter and a conjugate perpendicular to it intersect the least and inlterior circumnference If our attention for the instant be confined to any one of these centres and to the corresponding set of circles the bound ing circumuferences of the exterior and interior rings will be seen to touch the greatest and least of the nine principal circumferences at points in the principal diameter or its conjugate According to this construction there are five rings between the boujnding circumferences of each of the four sets of circles under consideration and all the twenty rings thuis constituited possess the same property with the eight rings first mentioned or in more specific terms the eight numbers in each of the twenty secondary rings with the auxiliary number at the principal centre form the suin 360 These are the different properties comnprised in the Magic Circle left by its original and sagacious author Thev certainly must be regarded as not a little curious and would seem to require a consider able faniiliarity with the powers of numbers As to the mode of investigation by which they were first discovered we have seen no account sufficient to enable us to pronounce with any degree of con fidence We should not however be inclined to think that they resulted either from conjecture or trial although they are by no means confined to the particular distribution of numbers published We should rather be disposed to join in the opinion that they were sug gested by remarks made on other arrangements previously formed But still we are forced to believe that they must have been deduced from views which were incapable of embracing in its full extent the general problem whenice originated the present observations The reasons which justify this conclusion will immediately appear on a glance at the drawing which accompanies this paper and which may be regarded as a generalization of Dr Franklins Magic Circle The additions made are Volutes commencing at the extremities of the diameters between the numbered radii and on which account the drawing may not inappropriately be termed a Magic CyclovoluteCONSTITUTING A MAGIC CYCLOVOLUTE 207 To trace one of these curves commence at the extremity A of the prinxcipal diameter AA and continue along the circle of which the centre is a nearly to the extent of a semicircle then incline towards the least interior circle aa bb anid terminate in its circumlference In like manner another volute may be traced in the opposite direction and thus will appear two of the volutes origiinating in the point A Six similar volutes may be traced from the extreme points A B B and all the eight viewed in pairs may be easily recognized by the four different colours in which they are delineated Besides these volutes we may trace eight analogous curves from the extremities of the diameters intermediate between the conjugates AA BB In the drawing they may be traced by passinig along circular segments de creasing and changing their colours whilst verging towards the interior circumference aa bb There will thus appear sixteen similar volutes in addition to the circles first described and all these have precisely the same property relatively to the number 360 which forms the com mon result of the auxiliary 12 and every eight numbers within any two consecutive boundaries These we believe are all the properties of which the arrangement of numbers constituting the cyclovolute appears susceptible and we intended to subjoin here the investigation whiclh led to them and to the different changes that may be made in disposing the numbers in the drawing We have however concluded to omit this investigation for the momenit and make it the subject of a supplementary note to be read at a future meeting Regarding the objects of the Society this paper is presented without any desire for its publication and chiefly in compliance with the wishes of a friend But as the Magic Circle originated and has I presume been completed in Philadelphia and as it has been considered in Europe as the most ingenious arrangement of numbers ever imagined the Society may not be disinclined to insert some notice of the subject in their records208 REMARKABLE ARRANGEMENT OF NUMBERS MAGIC CYCLOVOLUTE

WEATHER AND BAROMETER,I206914,124 XXV LETTERS OF HENRY EELES ESQ CON CERNING THE CAUSE OF THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR AND EXHALATION AND THOSE OF WINDS AND OF THE GENERAL PHAENOMENA OF THE WEATHER AND BAROMETER TO THE REV THO BIRCH D D SECRET R S L E T T E R I S I R LISMORE IN IRELAND NOV 25 1754 I RECEIVED YOUR LETTER OF THE 25TH OF NO VEMBER 1752 IN ANSWER TO MY LETTER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THUNDER AS YOU TELL ME THAT THEY HONOURED ME WITH THEIR DESIRE OF MY THOUGHTS ON SOME SUBJECTS MENTIONED THEREIN I HAVE VENTURED TO SEND YOU A LETTER FOR THEM ON ONE OF THOSE SUBJECTS INCLOSED IN TWO PACKETS BY THIS POST I FEAR THAT THE SOCIETY WILL THINK MY LETTER TOO HYPOTHETICAL OUR GREAT MODERN PHILOSOPHER HAVING IN SOME MEASURE CONDEMNED THE USE OF HYPOTHESES BUT I MUST BOLDLY OBSERVE THAT THAT OBJECTION IS MADE IN A PART OF HIS WORKS WHICH IS INTIRELY HYPOTHETICAL I MEAN HIS QUERIES AT THE END OF HIS THIRD BOOK OF OPTICS AND I SHALL VENTURE TO SHEW IF THE SOCIETY WILL HAVE PATIENCE TO HEAR ME THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL HYPOTHETICAL IN HIS SECOND BOOK OF OPTICS WHERE HE THINKS HIMSELF MORE ASCERTAINED FOR HE THERE SPEAKS PRETTY POSI TIVELY OF FOUR CAUSES OF THE REFRACTION C OF LIGHT THREE OF WHICH MUST BE WRONG AND THE FOURTH HIS AETHER READ JAN 23 1755125 AETHER IN THE MANNER HE HAS PROPOSED IT CAN NEVER BE SUFFICIENT FOR THAT PURPOSE NOT THAT I INTEND IM PUDENTLY TO BLAME THAT TRULY GREAT MAN BUT TO EN DEAVOUR TO INVESTIGATE THE CAUSE OF REFLECTION AND RE FRACTION OF LIGHT BY MEANS NOT MADE SENSIBLE TO MANKIND IN HIS TIME I MAY ALSO OBSERVE THAT IF HIS HYPOTHESIS HAD NOT PRECEDED HIS CALCULATION THE WORLD HAD NEVER BEEN OBLIGED TO HIM FOR HIS GREAT DOCTRINE OF ATTRACTION FOR AT FIRST HE ONLY SUPPOSED THAT THE POWER OF GRAVITY MAY EXTEND TO THE MOON AND THAT SHE MAY BE RETAINED IN HER ORBIT THEREBY BUT WHEN HE MADE HIS CALCULATION HAVING MISTAKEN SIXTY ENGLISH MILES FOR THE MEASURE OF A DEGREE ON THE SURFACE OF OUR EARTH HE THOUGHT THAT SOME OTHER POWER MUST COOPERATE WITH THAT OF GRAVITY TO KEEP THE MOON IN HER ORBIT AND FOR THAT TIME LAID HIS ATTEMPT ASIDE TILL PICART IN FRANCE MEASURED A DEGREE AND FOUND THAT IT CONTAINED ABOUT SIXTYNINE ENGLISH MILES AND AN HALF AND THEN OR SOME YEARS AFTER OUR GREAT AUTHOR HAVING RESUMED HIS COMPU TATION FOUND THAT THE POWER OF GRAVITY WAS ALONE SUFFICIENT TO KEEP THE MOON AND PLANETS IN THEIR OR BITS AND THEREBY PROVED HIS HYPOTHESIS INDEED IN WORKS OF INVENTION I CANNOT SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE TO PROCEED WITHOUT SOMETHING HYPO THETICAL FOR THE SUPPOSITION MUST EVER PRECEDE THE PROOF I AM NOT FOR ESTABLISHING HYPOTHESES AS PRIN CIPLES BUT IF AN HYPOTHESIS IS RATIONALLY FOUNDED I THINK IT IS WORTH THE WHILE TO INQUIRE INTO THE TRUTH OF IT AND THUS INVENTION MAY PROCEED I SHALL NOT SAY ANY THING IN JUSTIFICATION OF MY OWN BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ANY VANITY TO GRATIFY FOR IF MY LET TER HAS NOT ANY THING WORTH THE SOCIETYS OR YOUR ACCEPT ANCE126 ANCE I CAN MOST READILY AND WILLINGLY ASK PARDON FOR THE TROUBLE WHICH I HAVE GIVEN AND DESIST FROM GIVING ANY FOR THE FUTURE I AM S I R YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT HEN EELES TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY L E T T E R II GENTLEMEN LISMORE IN IRELAND NOV 25 1754 T H E GREAT HONOUR YOU HAVE DONE ME IN ACCEPTING MY LETTER CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THUNDER HAS EMBOL DENED ME TO PROCEED IN PART OF WHAT I THEREIN PRO POSED VIZ TO ENDEAVOUR TO SHEW THAT THE FIRE WHICH IS MADE APPARENT BY ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS IS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR AND EXHALA TION AND THAT THE LOWER PART OF OUR ATMOSPHERE IS BY THAT MEANS KEPT MORE HOMOGENEAL THAN IS GENE RALLY SUPPOSED AND FITTER FOR RESPIRATION VISION C AND THAT CLOUDS OF HETEROGENEOUS MATTER ARE KEPT SUSPENDED AT THEIR USUAL HEIGHT MERELY BY THIS FIRE TO WHICH I HAVE ADDED SOMETHING CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THE WINDS AND TO EXPLAIN THE GENERAL PHAE NOMENA OF THE WEATHER AND BAROMETER READ JAN 23 AND FEB 6 AND 13 1755 BUT AS I MUST NOW CONTRADICT SOME GENERALLY RE CEIVED OPINIONS IT MAY BE THOUGHT DECENT TO MAKE SOME APOLOGY FOR OFFERING MY OWN BUT I SHALL NOT TAKE127 TAKE UP YOUR TIME IN SO DOING FOR IF THEY CARRY AN APPEARANCE OF TRUTH I NEED NOT MAKE AN APOLOGY FOR THEM IF THEY APPEAR FALSE THEY CANNOT INJURE THOSE OPINIONS WHICH THEY CONTRADICT AND THEN I HAVE BUT ONE APOLOGY TO MAKE WHICH IS TO ACQUIESCE AND SINCERELY ASK YOUR PARDON FOR HAVING TROUBLED YOU WITH THEM IT IS AGREED THAT THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR AND EXHA LATION THROUGH THE AIR MAY BE EFFECTED TWO WAYS BY IMPULSE AND AN ALTERATION OF THEIR SPECIFIC GRA VITY THAT VAPOUR DOES NOT GENERALLY ASCEND BY IMPULSE MAY BE PROVED BY MANY FAMILIAR EXPERIMENTS VIZ PUT BOILING WATER INTO A VESSEL AND THEN EMPTY IT AND HOLD THE VESSEL WITH THE APPERTURE DOWNWARDS THE VAPOUR WHICH IS AFTERWARDS EXPELLED FROM THE VESSEL MUST BE IN A DIRECTION DOWNWARD BUT WE FIND THAT AS SOON AS IT HAS GOT BUT A VERY LITTLE BELOW THE RIM OF THE VESSEL IT HAS ITS DIRECTION ALTERED AND ASCENDS BY THE LAWS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY THE SAME THING MAY BE OBSERVED IN ALL BOILING VESSELS WHERE THE VAPOUR IS EMITTED IN A DIRECTION DOWNWARD OR IN COLD WEATHER WHEN THE VAPOUR OF A MANS BREATH MAY BE SEEN LET HIM BREATH DOWNWARD AND THE DIRECTION OF HIS BREATH WILL BE PRESENTLY ALTERED AS IN THE FORMER CASE SINCE THEN VAPOUR DOES ASCEND WITHOUT ANY OTHER IMPULSE THAN THAT WHICH IS INCI DENT ON ALL BODIES ASCENDING BY THE LAWS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY IT IS NECESSARY TO INQUIRE HOW THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF VAPOUR IS ALTERED TO CAUSE ITS ASCENT THIS IS GENERALLY SUPPOSED TO BE DONE BY FILLING VESICLES OF WATER WITH RARIFIED AIR UNTIL THE DIAMETER OF THE VESICLE BE TEN OR MORE TIMES THE DIAMETER OF A DROP OF128 OF WATER COMPOSED OF THE SAME CONSTITUENT PARTI CLES AND THAT THE VESICLE BY THIS MEANS BECOMES SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN AIR BUT I THINK THAT THIS CANNOT BE DONE SO EASILY AS IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY IMA GINED AND WHEN DONE IT WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE WHICH WILL APPEAR FROM THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS FIRST THE GREAT DIFFICULTY IN FORMING THOSE VESICLES ESPECIALLY OF THE PARTICLES OF DRY BODIES CARRIED OFF BY EXHALATION AND FILLING THEM WITH RARIFIED AIR WHILE THE EXTERIOR AIR REMAINS CONDENSED SECONDLY THAT THERE IS NOT ANY ALLOWANCE MADE FOR THE WEIGHT OF THE INCLUDED AIR THIRDLY THE CONSTITUENT PAR TICLES OF WATER ARE BUT VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL ALTERED IN THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY FOURTHLY THAT THIS THIN VESICLE CAN NEVER BE A SUFFICIENT BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE EX TERIOR CONDENSED AIR AND THE INTERIOR AIR SO EXCEED INGLY RARIFIED AND THEREFORE AS THE DENSITY OF AIR IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE FORCE COMPRESSING IT IT FOLLOWS THAT THE INTERIOR AIR MUST BE SUDDENLY COMPRESSED AND THE VESICLE WITH IT UNTIL IT BE OF EQUAL DENSITY WITH THE EXTERIOR AIR IN WHICH STATE THE VESICLE IS NOT MORE FITTED FOR ASCENDING THAN IF THE SAME CON STITUENT WATRY PARTICLES WERE FORMED INTO A SPHERICAL DROP FOR HERE I MUST BEG LEAVE TO SET ASIDE A FALSE REA SONING WHICH I HAVE FOUND IN MANY APPROVED WRITERS ON THIS SUBJECT WHO ASSERT THAT THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF BODIES IS ALTERED BY A MERE INCREASE OF SURFACE UPON THEIR BEING DIVIDED INTO MINUTE PARTS WHICH IS WRONG FOR THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF ANY BODY IS ONLY TO BE ALTERED BY MAKING THAT BODY OCCUPY A GREATER OR LESS PROPORTION OF SPACE IT IS EVIDENT THAT UPON DIVIDING 4129 DIVIDING A BODY INTO PARTS THE SURFACE INCREASES AC CORDING TO THE NUMBER OF PARTS BUT THE PROPORTION OF SPACE OCCUPIED AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SPECIFIC GRA VITY REMAINS THE SAME TAKE A CUBE WHOSE SIDE IS TEN INCHES THE SURFACE IS SIX HUNDRED INCHES THE SPACE OCCUPIED ONE THOUSAND CUBIC INCHES DIVIDE THAT CUBE INTO A THOUSAND CUBES THE SURFACE WILL BE INCREASED TO SIX THOUSAND SQUARE INCHES BUT THE SPACE OCCUPIED WILL REMAIN A THOUSAND CUBIC INCHES AND THEREFORE THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY WILL REMAIN THE SAME AND SO ON DIVIDE IT INTO AS MANY PARTS AS YOU PLEASE INDEED BODIES BY AN INCREASE OF SURFACE MEET A GREATER RESISTANCE IN PASSING THROUGH ANY MEDIUM BUT I THINK RESISTANCE AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY ARE HERE CARE FULLY TO BE DISTINGUISHED FOR THAT RESISTANCE WHICH PREVENTS THE SINKING OF THE MINUTE PARTS OF A BODY IN A FLUID SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER MUST EQUALLY RETARD THEIR ASCENT IN THE SAME FLUID AND THEREFORE CAN NEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR ASCENDING BUT LET US SUPPOSE THAT THIS VESICLE IS FORMED AND FILLED WITH RAREFIED AIR AND ASCENDING THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE IT IS PLAIN FROM ANOTHER CAUSE THAT IT CANNOT REMAIN SO DURING A FEW SECONDS OF TIME FOR NO SOLAR OR CULINARY HEAT CAN EXPAND AIR SO AS TO MAKE IT PERMANENT IN THAT STATE IN A VESICLE OF VA POUR ASCENDING THROUGH THE OPEN ATMOSPHERE FOR THE SPACE OF ONE MINUTE FOR IT IS EVIDENT THAT METALLIC BODIES HEATED MANY DEGREES HOTTER THAN BOILING WATER AND EXCEEDINGLY LARGER THAN THE ASCENDING VESICLE COOL IN A FEW SECONDS WHEN EXPOSED TO THE OPEN ATMOSPHERE FOR INSTANCE MECHANIC OPERATORS IN TEMPERING OF SMALL DRILLS ONLY HEAT THEM RED HOT IN THE FLAME OF A LAMP AND THEN WAVING THEM THREE VOL 49 S OR130 OR FOUR TIMES THROUGH THE AIR FIND THEM NOT ONLY COLD BUT HARDENED BY THEIR SUDDEN COOLING SO AS TO BE FIT FOR CUTTING OTHER PARTS OF THE SAME STEEL WHICH HAS BEEN COOLED MORE GRADUALLY NOW THE VESICLES BEING EXCEEDINGLY SMALLER THAN THE POINTS OF SUCH DRILLS MUST COOL MUCH QUICKER AND THE IN CLUDED AIR BE CONDENSED EQUAL TO THE CIRCUMAMBIENT AIR ALMOST INSTANTANEOUSLY IN WHICH STATE THE VESICLE IS NOT FITTER FOR ASCENDING THAN THAT PORTION OF WATER WAS BEFORE THE VESICLE WAS FORMED FOR THOUGH THE SURFACE OF THE WATER IS VASTLY INCREASED BY THE FORM OF THE VESICLE WHICH MAY RETARD THE DESCENT OF IT THROUGH THE AIR YET THAT FORM MUST EQUALLY OBSTRUCT ITS ASCENT AND THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE CONSTITUENT PARTICLES REMAINING THE SAME I CANNOT SEE HOW THE INCREASE OF SURFACE CAN AID ITS ASCENT AND HERE I MUST OBSERVE THAT IT HAS NOT YET BEEN EXPLAINED HOW WATER CAN BE DILATED SO AS TO OCCUPY EIGHT HUN DRED OR A THOUSAND TIMES THE SPACE WHICH IT NATURALLY DOES FOR I THINK THE GREATEST EXPANSION IT SUFFERS BY BOILING THE GREATEST HEAT WE CAN GIVE IT IS NOT MORE THAN A NINETEENTH OR TWENTIETH PART OF WHAT IT WAS BEFORE BUT SUPPOSING THESE VESICLES FORMED AND ASCENDING THERE IS STILL A VERY NECESSARY POWER WANTING I MEAN REPULSION TO PREVENT THEIR RUNNING INTO CONTACT BY THEIR NATURAL ATTRACTION AND FORMING LARGER MASSES IN WHICH STATE THEY WOULD IMMEDIATELY DESCEND NOW LET US SUPPOSE THAT THEY ASCEND BY IMPULSE IT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THEIR MOTIONS WHICH ARE EVIDENT TO SENSE FOR IF THEY ASCEND BY IMPULSE THEIR MOTION MUST BE CONTINUALLY RETARDED BY THEIR GRAVITY AND THE OBSTRUCTIONS OF THE AIR UNTIL THEY 4 ARRIVE131 ARRIVE AT THEIR GREATEST HEIGHT WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR FIRST VELOCITY AND THEN THEY MUST DESCEND BY THE LAWS OF SPECIFIC GRAVITY AS ALL OTHER BODIES DO THE VELOCITY WITH WHICH WE GENE RALLY SEE VAPOUR ASCEND IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO CARRY IT A FEW YARDS IN HEIGHT AND THEREFORE IF THERE WERE NO OTHER CAUSE OF ASCENT BUT IMPULSE THE VAPOURS AND EXHALATIONS MUST BE PRETTY EQUABLY DIFFUSED OVER THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH ASCENDING TO A SMALL HEIGHT AND IMMEDIATELY DESCENDING AGAIN OR IF IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO FLOAT AT THAT HEIGHT THE CONSEQUENCE MUST BE A PERPETUAL FOG HOW FAR THE GREAT USES OF VISION WOULD BE OBSTRUCTED OR LOST IN THIS CASE I NEED NOT MENTION NOR NEED I SAY HOW DETRIMENTAL IT WOULD PROVE TO RESPIRATION SINCE MANKIND HAVE AGREED TO CALL FOGS UNWHOLSOME HOWEVER WHEN I COME TO SPEAK OF THE USES OF ELECTRICAL FIRE IN ANIMAL LIFE I SHALL SAY SOMETHING ON THIS SUBJECT HOWEVER NECESSARY AN IMPULSIVE POWER MAY BE IN THE FIRST EMISSION OF VAPOUR AND EXHALATION FROM THEIR MASSES I THINK IT EVIDENT FROM THE SLOWNESS OF THEIR ASCENT THAT IT CANNOT CARRY THEM TO THAT HEIGHT WHERE CLOUDS ARE USUALLY FORMED MUCH LESS IS IT POSSIBLE THAT IT SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR FLOATING THERE FOR MANY DAYS AS WE SEE THEY DO THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE BY AN ALTERATION OF THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY TILL THEY ARE BROUGHT INTO AN AEQUILIBRIUM WITH PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE THEY FLOAT IT NOW REMAINS TO INQUIRE BY WHAT MEANS THIS MAY BE DONE SINCE NEITHER IMPULSE RAREFACTION OF THE AIR OR ANY FORMATION OF THEIR PARTS BY EXPANSION WHICH I KNOW OF SEEM SUFFICIENT FOR THE PURPOSE S 2 THERE132 THERE APPEARS TO ME BUT ONE WAY OF ALTERING THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE PARTICLES OF VAPOUR AND EXHA LATION TO RENDER THEM LIGHTER THAN AIR WHICH IS BY ADDING TO EACH PARTICLE A SUFFICIENT QUANTITY OF SOME FLUID WHOSE ELASTICITY AND RARITY ARE EXCEEDINGLY GREATER THAN THAT OF THE AIR THAT THE FLUID OR FIRE OF ELECTRICITY IS SUCH I BELIEVE WILL BE EASILY GRANTED ME BUT HOW FAR IT IS ADAPTED TO THIS PURPOSE WE MUST INQUIRE FROM EXPERIMENTS BUT FIRST LET ME NOT BE THOUGHT ABSURD IN SAYING THAT THE CREATOR MIGHT HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO ADAPT THIS FLUID TO THIS PARTICULAR PURPOSE FOR THE PURPOSE IS GREAT NO LESS THAN ALL VEGETATION AND ANI MAL LIFE DEPENDING ON THE ASCENT AND DESCENT OF VA POUR AND EXHALATION I NEED NOT RUN INTO A PROLIX DETAIL OF ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS TO PROVE THE PROPERTIES OF THIS FIRE WHICH ARE MUCH BETTER KNOWN TO YOU ALTHOUGH I HAVE MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH PERHAPS HAVE NOT YET COME BEFORE YOU BY WHICH IT APPEARS THAT ALL FUMES ARISING FROM FIRE WHETHER BLAZING OR OTHERWISE AND ALL STEAMS RISING FROM BOILING OR WARM WATERS AND FROM ALL OTHER FLUIDS AND THE BREATH OF MAN AND OF ALL OTHER ANIMALS AND ALL THE EFFLUVIA THROWN OFF BY PERSPIRATION ARE STRONGLY ELECTRIFIED BUT I SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOU WITH THESE TILL I COME TO SPEAK OF THE USES OF THIS FIRE IN ANI MAL LIFE I SHALL NOW ONLY MENTION A FEW WHICH ARE WELL KNOWN AND WHICH ARE TO MY PURPOSE FIRST THAT DEFULTORY MOTION BY WHICH IT FLIES OFF FROM AN ELECTRIFIED BODY TO ANY NUMBER OF NONELECTRICS WHICH ARE BROUGHT WITHIN THE SPHERE OF ITS ACTIVITY AND AFFECTION UNTIL IT BE EQUABLY DIFFUSED THROUGH ALL SECONDLY133 SECONDLY THAT THE SPHERE OF ITS ACTIVITY IS INCREASED BY HEAT THIRDLY THAT THIS FIRE DOES NOT MIX WITH AIR FOURTHLY THAT IT INTIMATELY PERVADES WATER AND MANY OTHER BODIES COVERING THEIR SUPERFICIES TO A CERTAIN DISTANCE WHICH DISTANCE IS NOT IN PROPOR TION TO THE BULK OF THE BODY ELECTRIFIED BUT IN PRO PORTION TO THE STATE OF ACTIVITY OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID FIFTHLY THIS ELECTRICAL FLUID READILY JOINS WITH ANY FIRE WHICH FUMES OR RATHER WITH THE BLAZE OR FUMES OF ANY FIRE BUT WILL NOT MIX OR FLY OFF WITH THE FIRE OF REDHOT IRON OR ANY OTHER METAL WHICH DOES NOT FUME I HAVE NOT MET WITH THIS IN ANY WRITER ON ELECTRICITY BUT I HAVE PROVED IT BY EXPERIMENTS NOW TO SHEW THAT THIS ELECTRICAL FIRE OR FLUID IS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR AND EX HALATION WE NEED ONLY PROVE THAT IT ATTENDS ALL VA POUR AND EXHALATION AND THAT IN SUCH QUANTITY AS IS NECESSARY TO RENDER THEM SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN THE LOWER PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE I SHALL NOT UNDERTAKE TO DETERMINE BY WHAT CAUSE VAPOUR AND EXHALATION ARE DETACHED FROM THEIR MASSES WHETHER BY THE SOLAR OR CULINARY FIRE OR BY THE VI BRATIONS OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID RENDERED MORE ACTIVE BY THOSE FIRES THOUGH I AM LED TO THINK THE LATTER BUT IT IS EVIDENT THAT THEY ARE EMITTED IN EXCEEDING MINUTE DISTINCT PARTICLES AND THAT THESE PARTICLES MUST PASS THROUGH THAT ELECTRICAL FLUID WHICH SURROUNDS THE SURFACE OF THE MASS AND THAT BY THAT MEANS THEY MUST BE EQUALLY ELECTRIFIED WITH THE MASS THAT IS THEY MUST BE COVERED WITH THE ELECTRICAL FLUID TO AS GREAT A DISTANCE FROM THEIR SUPERFICIES AS THE MASS IS COVERED WHICH MUST ALWAYS BE IN PROPORTION TO THE STATE OF ACTIVITY OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID IN WHICH STATE134 STATE WHEN THEY HAVE PASSED THE SURROUNDING FLUID THEY MUST BE REPELLED BY IT AND ALSO REPEL EACH OTHER AND IF EACH PARTICLE OF VAPOUR AND ITS SUR ROUNDING FLUID OCCUPY A GREATER SPACE THAN THE SAME WEIGHT OF AIR THEY MUST BE FITTED TO ASCEND TILL THEY COME IN AEQUILIBRIUM WITH THE UPPER AND RARER PART OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHERE THEY MUST FLOAT UNTIL THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS ALTERED AS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN THE MAGNITUDE OF EACH PARTICLE OF VAPOUR AND EXHALATION AND THAT OF THE SURROUNDING FLUID AND TO SHEW THAT BOTH TAKEN TOGETHER OCCUPY A GREATER PORTION OF SPACE THAN THE SAME WEIGHT OF AIR WE CAN ONLY APPLY TO EXPERIMENT TO SHEW THAT IT IS POS SIBLE THAT IT MAY BE SO AND THAT WILL SHEW THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY IT IS SO SINCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT EVERY PARTICLE MUST BE ENDUED WITH A PORTION OF THIS ELEC TRICAL FIRE OR FLUID AND THAT THERE IS NOT ANY OTHER SUFFICIENT CAUSE ASSIGNED FOR THEIR ASCENDING IT IS EVIDENT THAT UPON ELECTRIFYING ANY LIGHT MATTER SUCH AS DOWN OR THE DOWNY PARTS OF FEATHERS THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS MUCH LESSENED AND THAT BY HOLDING ANOTHER ELECTRIFIED BODY UNDER THEM THEY MAY BE DRIVEN UPWARDS AT PLEASURE IT IS ALSO EVI DENT FROM EXPERIMENT THAT THE MORE YOU DIVIDE THE PARTS OF SUCH BODIES THE MORE OF THEIR SPECIFIC GRA VITY THEY WILL LOOSE BY BEING ELECTRIFIED AND BY DI VIDING THEM INTO VERY MINUTE PARTS I HAVE FOUND THAT THEY ASCENDED TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT AFTER THEY WERE ELECTRIFIED FROM WHENCE I THINK IT HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT THE EXCEEDING SMALL PARTICLES OF VA POUR AND EXHALATION MAY BE AND ARE SUFFICIENTLY ELECTRIFIED TO RENDER THEM SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN THE LOWER AIR AND THAT THEY DO ASCEND BY THAT MEANS AND135 AND THAT THEY WILL ASCEND PROPORTIONALLY HIGHER AS THE SURROUNDING FLUID IS PROPORTIONALLY GREATER THAN THE PARTICLE WHICH IS CARRIED UP IT MAY BE NOW THOUGHT NECESSARY TO SHEW WHAT BECOMES OF OUR VAPOUR AND EXHALATION ABOVE OR HOW THEY ARE TO COME DOWN AGAIN BUT I MUST HERE BEG YOUR PATIENCE WHILE I ENDEAVOUR TO SHEW THAT THE ASCENT AND DESCENT OF VAPOUR AND EXHALATION ATTENDED BY THIS FIRE IS THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF ALL OUR WINDS IN DOING OF WHICH I HOPE TO BRING DOWN THE VAPOUR AND EXHALATIONS AND TO EXPLAIN THE GENERAL PHAENO MENA OF THE WEATHER AND BAROMETER IT BEING ADMITTED THAT WIND IS ONLY AIR PUT INTO MOTION MANY HAVE BEEN THE CONJECTURES HOW THAT MOTION IS CAUSED AMONG WHICH THE MOTION OF THE EARTH AND THE AIRS BEING RAREFIED BY THE SUN SEEM TO STAND FIRST THE TRADE WINDS BEING MOST REGULAR AND OCCUPYING A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE GLOBE IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT PROPER FIRST TO ACCOUNT FOR THEM FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED CAUSES BUT I THINK THAT THESE CAUSES BY THEMSELVES ARE NOT SUFFICIENT FOR THE MOTION OF THOSE WINDS AND MUCH LESS SO FOR THE IRREGULAR MOTION OF ALL THE OTHER WINDS IF THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE AIR WAS OCCASIONED BY THE DIURNAL REVOLUTION OF THE EARTH FROM WEST TO EAST BY THE AIRS BEING LEFT BEHIND THE MOTION MUST BE FOUND MORE REGULAR AND VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT IS FOR IN THAT CASE THE GREATEST MOTION MUST BE AT THE EQUATOR AND FROM THENCE LESSEN BY REGULAR DEGREES TO THE POLES AND MUST BE CONTINUED ALWAYS EQUALLY ONE WAY BOTH DAY AND NIGHT AND AT ALL SEASONS BUT WE FIND QUITE THE CONTRARY THE MOST GENTLE GALES BLOWING AT THE EQUA TOR136 TOR AND BETWEEN THE TROPICS PRETTY STEADILY ONE WAY ALL DAY LONG AND DYING AWAY AT NIGHT WHILE HIGH WINDS AND STORMS BLOWING ALL MANNER OF WAYS ARE FOUND IN THE HIGHER LATITUDES I SHALL NOT DETAIN YOU TO SHEW THAT THE SUNS RAREFYING AIR CANNOT SIMPLY BE THE CAUSE OF ALL THE REGULAR AND IRREGULAR MOTIONS WHICH WE FIND IN THE ATMOSPHERE BUT I SHALL PRO CEED TO WHAT I THINK IS THE CAUSE VIZ THE ASCENT AND DESCENT OF VAPOUR AND EXHALATION ATTENDED BY THE ELECTRICAL FIRE OR FLUID YOU ARE WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE CALCULATIONS BY SUNDRY AUTHORS OF THE QUANTITY OF VAPOURS RAISED IN A DAY BUT I WILL VENTURE TO SAY THAT ALL THOSE WHICH I HAVE MET WITH FALL EXCEEDINGLY SHORT OF THE QUAN TITY RAISED IN THE TORRID ZONE NOW ALL THIS VAPOUR AND EXHALATION BEING BUOYD UP BY THE ELECTRICAL FIRE MUST ADD A COLUMN TO THE AIR THOUGH OF A DIFFERENT MATTER AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THE VAPOUR AND EXHALATION TAKEN UP WHICH COLUMN MUST NECESSARILY FORCE THE ADJACENT PART OF THE IN CUMBENT AIR UPWARDS AND MUST AS NECESSARILY BE REACTED UPON BY THE INCUMBENT AIR TO RESTORE THE AEQUILIBRIUM OF THE WHOLE AIR AND AS IT CANNOT BE READILY FORCED DOWN AGAIN IT MUST FLOAT OFF AT THAT ALTITUDE TOWARD THOSE PARTS WHERE LITTLE OR NO ADDI TION HAS BEEN MADE TO THE ATMOSPHERE AND BY THAT MEANS MUST PROPEL THE AIR ON THE HORIZONTAL LEVEL WITH IT AND THAT BELOW IT AS IT IS ITSELF PROPELLED BY THE WEIGHT OF THE INCUMBENT AIR AND THAT MOTION MUST BE FROM THE EQUATOR WHERE THE GREATEST QUAN TITY OF VAPOUR C IS RAISED TOWARD THE POLES AND PARTLY TO THE WEST AS THE COLUMN OF VAPOUR IS AL WAYS RISING FROM EAST TO WEST AS THE EARTH TURNS TO WARD137 WARD THE SUN FOR HERE WE MUST CONFESS THAT THE SUN IS THE GREAT AGENT IN DETACHING VAPOUR AND EXHA LATION FROM THEIR MASSES WHETHER HE ACTS IMMEDI DIATELY BY HIMSELF OR BY HIS RENDERING THE ELECTRIC FIRE MORE ACTIVE IN ITS VIBRATIONS BUT THEIR SUBSE QUENT ASCENT I ATTRIBUTE INTIRELY TO THEIR BEING REN DERD SPECIFICALLY LIGHTER THAN THE LOWER AIR BY THEIR CONJUNCTION WITH THIS ELECTRICAL FIRE THE FIRE WHICH SURROUNDS THE VAPOUR BEGINNING TO CONDENSE AND THE VAPOUR TO SUBSIDE IN PASSING THE TROPICS BECOMES A GREATER PRESSURE ON THE AIR BENEATH AND BY THAT MEANS FORCES SOME PART BACK INTO THE TROPICS IN THE PLACE OF THAT AIR PROTRUDED BY THE ASCENT OF THE VA POUR C AND THE REMAINDER IN A DIRECTION TOWARD THE POLES THE COMMON ROTATION OF THE AIR IN COMING IN BELOW TO SUPPLY THE PLACE OF THAT PART CARRIED UP BY ANY FIRE MAY EXPLAIN THIS MOTION TO SHEW HOW THIS MOTION MUST TEND TO THE WEST WE MUST CONSIDER THAT THE COLUMN OF AIR RAISED BY THE ASCENDING VAPOUR C IS AT ITS GREATEST ALTITUDE TO THE EAST AND THEREFORE MUST PRESS THAT AIR TO THE WESTWARD WHICH IS CONTINUALLY PROTRUDED BY THE VA POURS C BEGINNING TO ASCEND FROM EAST TO WEST AND THE COMPRESSED AIR AT THE TROPICS MUST TEND TO THE WESTWARD TILL THEIR FORCES MEETING MAKE THE MO TION INTIRELY TO THE WEST THE AIR ITSELF BEING RARE FIED AND CARRIED UP BY THE REFLECTION OF THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE SUN FOR HEAT IN FLYING OFF FROM ALL BO DIES DOES ASCEND THROUGH THE AIR WITH GREAT VELO CITY MAY BE A CONSIDERABLE ADDITIONAL CAUSE OF THESE TRADE WINDS BUT NEVER CAN BE THE SOLE CAUSE OF ALL THE ERRATIC WINDS AS I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY INFORMD OF THE PARTICULAR FORMATION OF THE GLOBE TO ACCOUNT VOL 49 T FOR138 FOR ALL THE IRREGULAR WINDS WITHIN THE TROPICS I SHALL ONLY VENTURE TO SAY THAT WHERE SUCH HAPPEN IT MUST BE BY MEANS OF SOME TRACTS OF LAND WHICH RISE TO A GREATER HEIGHT ABOVE THE HORIZONTAL LEVEL THAN VAPOURS GENERALLY DO BY WHICH THE MOTION OF THE VAPOURS IS STOPPED AND THE VAPOUR ACCUMULATED BY SUCCEEDING VAPOUR AND THE AIR UPON WHICH THEY FLOAT IS OF CONSEQUENCE PRESSED INTO A NEW DIRECTION AND FROM HENCE MAY ALSO BE EXPLAINED THE CAUSE OF THE RAINS PARTICULARLY SO CALLED IN THE SEA LANGUAGE I MUST NOW CONSIDER WHAT BECOMES OF THE VAPOUR C FLOATING FROM OVER THE TROPICS TOWARD THE POLES WHICH BEING LESS AFFECTED BY THE HEAT OF THE SUN RE FLECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE THE SURROUND ING ELECTRICAL FIRE BEGINS TO CONDENSE MORE AND MORE AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE POLES AND THE VAPOURS OF COURSE TO DESCEND AND THAT PART MOST WHICH IS MOST REMOTE FROM OR IS FARTHEST LEFT BEHIND BY THE SUN AND OF CONSEQUENCE THE HIGHER COLUMN OF AIR MUST TEND THAT WAY TO RESTORE THE EQUILIBRIUM WHICH MO TION AT THIS SIDE THE EQUATOR MUST BE TO THE NORTH EAST AND AS THE VAPOUR C FALL AGAIN TO THE EARTH THE MOTION MUST BE MORE TO THE EAST FROM WHENCE OUR SOUTHWEST AND WESTERLY WINDS WHICH BLOW A CONSIDERABLE PART OF THE YEAR BUT AS THIS SYSTEM IS TOO REGULAR TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PHAENOMENA OF THE ERRATIC WINDS WE MUST CON SIDER WHENCE THEY ARISE I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THAT TRACTS OF LAND RISING INTO THE ATMOSPHERE WILL STOP THE REGULAR MOTION OF THE VAPOUR C AND THAT THE VA POUR BEING ACCUMULATED BY SUCCEEDING VAPOUR THE SUBJACENT AIR MUST BE PRESSED INTO NEW DIRECTIONS NOW THIS CAUSE ADDED TO THE DAILY DILATATION OF THE ELECTRICAL139 ELECTRICAL FIRE AND THE CONTRACTION AT NIGHT AND THE COALITION OF THE VAPOURS TO OCCASION THEIR TOTAL DE SCENT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A VERY GREAT VA RIETY OF WINDS ON THIS SIDE THE TROPIC BUT IF I WERE TO SET DOWN ALL THAT HAS OCCURRED UPON THIS SUBJECT ABOUT UPPER CURRENTS UNDER CURRENTS AND INTERME DIATE TRANSVERSE CURRENTS C OCCASIONED BY THE VA RIOUS MOTIONS OF THE ATMOSPHERE TO RESTORE AN EQUI LIBRIUM AND TO PRODUCE MY PROOFS I MUST SEND YOU A BOOK INSTEAD OF A LETTER BUT I WRITE NOT TO COM MON MINDS IT NOW REMAINS TO SHEW HOW THE GENERAL PHAENO MENA OF THE WEATHER AND BAROMETER ARISE FROM THIS SYSTEM FIRST WHY IT GENERALLY RAINS IN WINTER WHILE THE WIND IS SOUTH SOUTHWEST AND WESTERLY SECONDLY WHY NORTHWEST WINDS ARE GENERALLY AT TENDED BY SHOWERS IN THE BEGINNING AND BECOME MORE DRY AS THEY ARE OF LONGER CONTINUANCE THIRDLY WHY NORTH AND NORTHEAST WINDS ARE GENERALLY DRY FOURTHLY WHY THE EAST WIND CONTINUES DRY AND DARK FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME TOGETHER FIFTHLY WHY SQUALLS PRECEDE HEAVY AND DISTINCT SHOWERS AND WHY A CALM ENSUES FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER THEY ARE PASSD SIXTHLY WHY STORMS AND HIGH WINDS SELDOM HAPPEN IN A SERENE SKY WITHOUT CLOUDS SEVENTHLY WHY THE VAPOURS IN WARM SEASONS COALESCE TO FORM THOSE DISTINCT DENSE CLOUDS WHICH PRODUCE THUNDER AND HEAVY SHOWERS EIGHTHLY WHY THE BAROMETER FALLS LOWEST IN LONG CONTINUED RAINS ATTENDED BY WINDS AND WHY IT RISES HIGHEST IN LONG CONTINUED FAIR WEATHER AND WHY THE INTERMEDIATE CHANGES HAPPEN NINTHLY OF LANDBREEZES AND SEABREEZES AND WA TERSPOUTS T 2 FIRST140 FIRST THE VAPOURS PASSING THE TROPICS INTO COLDER REGIONS HAVE THEIR SURROUNDING FIRE CONDENSED BY DE GREES WHICH MUST INCREASE THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND LESSEN THEIR REPULSIVE POWER BY WHICH MEANS THEY MUST BOTH DESCEND AND APPROACH EACH OTHER TILL AT LAST THEY FORM DENSE VISIBLE CLOUDS AND THESE CLOUDS ARE ALSO ACCUMULATED BY OTHER SUCCEEDING VAPOURS OF LIKE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TILL THEY FORM CLOUDS WHICH ARE OFTEN SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS IN DEPTH WHICH I HAVE OFTEN SEEN IN PASSING THROUGH THEM UP THE SIDES OF VERY HIGH MOUNTAINS IN CLOUDS OF SUCH DEPTH I THINK THE COALITION OF THEIR PARTICLES TO FORM DROPS MAY ARISE FROM THEIR MOTION AND THE ORDER OF SPE CIFIC GRAVITY FOR THE AIR BEING A GREAT DEAL DENSER AND OF GREATER SPECIFIC GRAVITY AT THE BOTTOM OF SUCH A CLOUD THAN IT IS AT THE TOP AND THE PARTICLES OF VAPOUR WITH THEIR FIRE BEING PRETTY NEAR AN EQUAL SPECIFIC GRAVITY THOSE PARTICLES WHICH ARE BELOW MUST NECESSARILY BE FORCED UPWARDS AND THOSE ABOVE MUST AS NECESSARILY DESCEND TILL THEY ALL MEET AT THAT ALTITUDE WHEREAT THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY WOULD MAKE THEM FLOAT IF THEY WERE NOT PREVENTED MERELY BY THEIR REPULSIVE POWER BUT THIS REPULSIVE POWER MUST BE GREATLY ACTED UPON IF NOT QUITE OVERCOME IN SOME PLACES BY THIS PRESSURE OF THE AIR AND OF THE VAPOURS BUT SUPPOSING THE PARTICLES BROUGHT INTO A VERY NEAR APPROACH BY THIS PRESSURE IT WILL BE SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR THEM UPON ANY MOTION OF THE CLOUDS TO KEEP THEIR STATED DISTANCES WITHOUT IMPINGING UP ON ONE ANOTHER AND WHENEVER THIS HAPPENS IT IS EASY TO SHEW HOW RAIN IS FORMED FOR WHEREEVER TWO OR MORE PARTICLES ARE FORCED TO APPROACH WITHIN THEIR REPULSIVE POWERS THEY WILL RUN INTO CONTACT AND SPHERICITY141 SPHERICITY IF FLUID BY THEIR ATTRACTIVE INFERREDPOWERINFERRED AND BY THAT MEANS BECOME COVERED WITH THE ELECTRICAL FLUID TO A GREATER DISTANCE FROM THEIR SUPERFICIES THAN THE OTHER PARTICLES ARE OR THAN THEY WERE BEFORE THEIR CONJUNCTION AS I HAVE SHEWN IN MY LETTER CONCERN ING THE CAUSE OF THUNDER THAT IS WILL BE MORE ELECTRIFIED AND CONSEQUENTLY AS APPEARS BY ELECTRICAL EXPERIMENTS THE EXCESS OF ELECTRICAL FLUID WILL RUN OFF AMONG THE OTHER PARTICLES BY WHICH MEANS THE ENLARGED PARTICLES HAVE THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY INCREASED AND ARE ENABLED TO DESCEND TO A LOWER REGION OF THE AIR AND THE MORE PARTICLES THEY IMPINGE UPON IN THEIR DESCENT THE MORE THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY AND VELOCITY BE INCREASED AND THE MORE THEIR VELOCITY IS INCREASED THE MORE PARTICLES WILL THEY IMPING UPON TILL THEY FALL FROM THE CLOUDS IN DROPS WHOSE BIGNESS WILL BE ACCORDING TO THE DEPTH AND DENSITY OF THE CLOUD THEY HAVE PASSED THROUGH IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO SHEW WHY I ASSERT THAT THE INCREASE OF VELOCITY IN THE ENLARGED PARTICLE WILL MAKE IT IMPINGE UPON A GREATER NUMBER OF THE SMALLER PARTICLES IN ITS PASSAGE THROUGH THEM AND THIS WILL APPEAR BY ELECTRIFYING A FEATHER WHICH MAY BE DRIVEN UPWARDS BY THE ELECTRIC BODY WITH A CERTAIN VELO CITY BUT IF YOU ADD A MUCH GREATER VELOCITY TO THE ELECTRIC BODY IT WILL OVERTAKE THE FEATHER AND GET WITHIN THEIR REPULSIVE POWERS AND THE FEATHER WILL STICK TO IT BY THEIR ATTRACTIVE POWERS AND THE LESS DISTANCE THE FEATHER KEEPS ABOVE THE ELECTRIC BODY THE LESS INCREASE OF VELOCITY IS NECESSARY TO MAKE THEM JOIN YOU WILL PARDON MY PROLIXITY IN THIS PARTICULAR BECAUSE I THINK MUCH DEPENDS UPON IT IN THE FORMATION OF RAIN HAVING142 HAVING SHEWN HOW I THINK VAPOUR MAY COALESCE INTO RAIN I SHALL NOW ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN THE PHAE NOMENA OF THE WEATHER C FIRST WHY OUR SOUTH SOUTHWEST AND WESTERLY WINDS ARE WET IN WINTER I HAVE BEFORE SHEWN THAT THE WIND AND THE VAPOUR WITH IT MUST TEND FROM THE TROPIC TOWARD THE POLE AND HOW IT MAY BE VARIED TO THE NORTHEAST AND TO THE EAST IN THE COLD WINTER SEASON THE VAPOUR IN THIS COURSE MUST COALESCE MORE AND MORE AS IT COMES INTO THE COLDER REGIONS AND AT LAST COME DOWN IN MISTS AND RAIN AND THE MORE THE COLUMN OF AIR IS DECREASED BY THE FALL OF SUCH MISTS AND RAIN THE MORE ROOM IS THERE FOR SUCCEEDING VA POURS TO BE PRESSED INTO THE SAME COURSE AND TO FALL IN LIKE MANNER AND SO ON WHICH MAY OCCASION THE CONTINUED COURSE OF THESE WINDS AND WET WHICH GENE RALLY ATTENDS OUR WINTERS BUT SOMETIMES AT THE FALL OF THESE RAINS THE WIND COMES IN FROM THE NORTHWEST TO RESTORE THE BALANCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND ROLL THE VAPOURS STILL FLOATING IN THE AIR BY ALTERING THEIR MOTION INTO HEAVY DENSE CLOUDS WHICH UPON THEIR SUDDEN COALITION LET FALL HEAVY SHOWERS BUT BY THAT MEANS THE REMAINING PARTICLES OF VAPOUR IN THE CLOUD HAVE A GREATER QUANTITY OF ELECTRIC FLUID DISTRIBUTED AMONG THEM WHICH ENABLES THEM TO ASCEND AND FORM WHAT THE SAILORS CALL A HARD DRY SKY AND AS THEY APPROACH FARTHER INTO A WARMER CLIMATE WHICH INCREASES THE POWER OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUID THEY RISE DISSIPATE AND VANISH OUT OF SIGHT AND THIS IS THE GENERAL CONSEQUENCE OF NORTHWEST WINDS AS TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST WINDS WHAT EVER VAPOUR THEY BRING WITH THEM HAS ITS REPULSIVE AND ASCENDING POWER THAT IS THE ELECTRIC FLUID SO IN CREASED 1143 CREASED BY APPROACHING INTO WARMER AND WARMER CLI MATES THAT IT SCARCE EVER COMES DOWN IN RAIN EXCEPT FROM THE EFFECTS OF SOME UPPER CURRENT OF THE AIR IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS WHILE THE WIND BLOWS VERY GENTLY AT EAST THAT THE VAPOURS COALESCE AT A CONSIDER ABLE HEIGHT IN THE ATMOSPHERE SO AS TO FORM ONE EVEN UNIFORM CLOUD SUFFICIENT TO SHUT OUT THE BRIGHT SHINING LIGHT OF THE SUN WHICH IS THEREFORE CALLED A DARK SKY WHICH CLOUD BEING UNIFORM AND OF NO GREAT THICKNESS AND CARRIED ON BY A VERY GENTLE MO TION AND THAT NEITHER APPROACHING TO A WARMER OR A COLDER CLIMATE AND SELDOM DESCENDING SO LOW AS TO BE DISTURBED BY THE TOPS OF MOUNTAINS THE VAPOURS MAY KEEP THE ORDER OF THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME AS THEY GENERALLY DO TILL SOME CROSS OR OPPOSITE WIND FORCES THEM TO SEPERATE INTO DENSER CLOUDS AND LEAVE APERTURES FOR THE SUN TO SHINE THROUGH AND THIS IS GENERALLY THE CASE FOR A DAY OR TWO BEFORE ANY WET DESCENDS WHY SQUALLS PRECEDE HEAVY DISTINCT SHOWERS AND A CALM ENSUES FOR SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER THEY ARE PASSED IS PRETTY EVIDENT FOR THE DESCENDING RAIN ATTENDED BY THE ELECTRICAL FLUID FORCES THE SUBJACENT AIR OUT OF ITS PLACE AND THAT WHICH IS DRIVEN FORWARD MUST ADD A PROPORTIONAL VELOCITY TO THE MOTION OF THE WIND THAT WAY AND THAT WHICH IS DRIVEN BACK WARD MUST ALSO OBSTRUCT THE MOTION OF THE WIND AD VANCING AFTER THE CLOUD THE WIND PRECEDING THE CLOUD IS ALSO PRESSED OFF OBLIQUELY TOWARD EACH EX TREME OF THE SHOWER WHICH MAY BE OF GOOD USE FOR SAILORS TO KNOW AND OBSERVE FOR IF THEY SAIL UPON A WIND FROM THE CENTER OF THE SHOWER TOWARD THE EXTREMITY THEY MAY SAFELY VENTURE TO KEEP THEIR LUFF BUT144 BUT IF THEY SAIL FROM THE EXTREMITY TOWARD THE CEN TRE IF THEY LUFF UP THEY WILL BE TAKEN ABACK AND RUN THE HAZARD OF BEING DISMASTED AND THIS I AL WAYS FOUND TRUE IN PRACTICE WHY HIGH WINDS ARE SELDOM FOUND IN A SERENE SKY WITHOUT CLOUDS IS ALSO PRETTY EVIDENT FOR CLOUDS OC CASION THESE HIGH WINDS IN A DOUBLE MANNER FIRST WHEN THEY ARE LARGE AND UNITED AND UPON THE DE SCENT AS THEY OCCUPY A GREAT SPACE IN THE ATMOS PHERE THEY MUST PRESS THE SUBJACENT AIR INTO A GREAT VELOCITY AND SECONDLY WHEN THEY COALESCE AND COME DOWN IN HEAVY RAINS THEY MAKE ROOM FOR THE AIR TO FLOW IN WITH VIOLENCE TO RESTORE THE EQUILI BRIUM OF THE WHOLE AIR TO KNOW HOW THE VAPOURS COALESCE IN WARM SEA SONS TO FORM THOSE DISTINCT DENSE CLOUDS WHICH PRO DUCE THUNDER AND HEAVY SHOWERS WE MUST FIRST CON SIDER THE STATE OF THE VAPOUR IN ITS ASCENT WHICH MUST BE STRONGLY ENDUED WITH THE ELECTRICAL FIRE TO ENABLE IT TO ASCEND TO THE GREAT HEIGHT IT THEN DOES IN THE ATMOSPHERE SECONDLY THE GREAT QUANTITY CARRIED UP AND KEPT AFLOAT AT THAT GREAT HEIGHT DURING A SERIES OF HOT DRY WEATHER THE QUANTITY MAY BE PROVED FROM THE HEIGHT OF THE MERCURY IN THE BARO METER AS I SHALL SHEW PRESENTLY AND THE GREAT HEIGHT AND DISSIPATION OF THE VAPOUR FROM THE SE RENE APPEARANCE OF THE SKY AND ALSO BY THE GREAT HEIGHT WHERE EVEN THUNDERCLOUDS ARE FORMED IN ITS DESCENT WHICH MAY BE EASILY MEASURED BY THE LENGTH OF TIME BETWEEN THE LIGHT AND NOISE OF THUNDER IN THIS STATE THE UPPER AIR IS IN A QUIETUDE AND WHAT EVER PART OF THIS VAPOUR BEGINS TO COALESCE AND SUB SIDE FIRST WILL CARRY DOWN WITH IT PART OF THE SUBJA CENT145 CENT VAPOUR AND MAKE ROOM AT THE TOP FOR OTHER VAPOURS TO FLOW IN FROM ALL SIDES WHICH BY THEIR MEETING MAY ALSO COALESCE AND SUBSIDE TO FORM THIS CENTRAL DESCENDING CLOUD AND SO ALSO OF LIKE SUCCEED ING VAPOURS AND THUS I THINK CLOUDS OF ANY DEN SITY MAY BE FORMED IN A QUIET AIR AND THUNDER GENE RALLY HAPPENS IN CALM WEATHER TILL THE DENSITY IS TOO GREAT FOR THE BUOYANT ELECTRICAL FIRE TO SUSTAIN THE WEIGHT WHICH FLYING OFF IN PART FROM THE LARGEST DROPS LETS THEM FALL ALMOST IN SPOUTS WHY THE MERCURY FALLS AND RISES IN THE BAROMETER WILL APPEAR FROM WHAT I HAVE BEEN SAYING FOR IN LONG CONTINUED FAIR DRY WEATHER THERE IS A GREAT QUANTITY OF VAPOUR RAISED AND KEPT AFLOAT IN THE AIR WHICH MUST NECESSARILY ADD A COLUMN TO THE AIR AT LEAST A THOUSAND TIMES GREATER THAN THE VAPOUR TAKEN UP AND OFTEN MUCH GREATER THAN THAT WHICH MUST AS NECESSARILY INCREASE THE WEIGHT OF THE AIR AND MAKE THE MERCURY RISE PROPORTIONAL TO THE ADDI TIONAL COLUMN AND WHEN RAINS DESCEND THEY SUB STRACT A COLUMN FROM THE AIR NEAR A THOUSAND TIMES AS GREAT AS THE WATER FALLEN WHICH MUST NECESSARILY LESSEN THE WEIGHT OF THE AIR AND MAKE THE MERCURY FALL PROPORTIONAL TO SUCH SUBTRACTION AS TO THE WINDS THEY AFFECT NOT THE MERCURY BUT AS THEY ARE GENERALLY IN THESE CLIMATES A CONSEQUENCE OF DE SCENDING CLOUDS AND RAINS BLOWING INTO THOSE PARTS WHERE THE COLUMN OF AIR HAS BEEN LESSENED AND WHILE THEY BLOW THE MERCURY WILL CONTINUE LOW IN THE BA ROMETER TILL THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE ATMOSPHERE BE RESTORED BUT I BELIEVE IF IT WERE INQUIRED INTO WHETHER THE MERCURY DESCENDS WHEN THE WIND BEGINS TO BLOW EVERY MORNING BETWEEN THE TROPICS AND THE VOL 49 U VAPOURS146 VAPOURS TO ASCEND THAT IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE MERCURY RATHER ASCENDS THERE IS A PHAENOMENON WHICH HAS PUZZLED MANY THAT IS WHY THE MERCURY FALLS BEFORE THE RAIN FALLS THIS MAY BE EXPLAINED BY THE COLUMN OF AIRS BEING LESSENED GRADUALLY BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE ELEC TRICAL FLUID FROM THE FIRST DESCENT OF THE VAPOURS TILL THEY FALL IN RAIN I SHALL NOW SAY SOMETHING OF LANDBREEZES AND SEABREEZES A PHAENOMENON WHICH SOMETIMES HAP PENS IN FAIR SETTLED WEATHER THAT THE WIND BLOWS OUT FROM THE LAND AT NIGHT AND IN FROM THE SEA AT DAYTIME THE LANDBREEZE IS OCCASIONED BY THE DE SCENT OF THE CLOUDS AND THE PARTICULAR FORMATION OF THE LAND FOR IF THE LAND RISE INTO A HILLY COUNTRY FROM THE SEA WHEN THE CLOUDS AND VAPOURS DESCEND AT NIGHT WHICH THEY OFTEN DO BY THE ELECTRICAL FLUIDS BEING CONDENSED THEY MUST PRESS THE AIR DOWN THE LAND TOWARD THE SEA IN THEIR FALL AS MAY APPEAR FROM THE SMOKE OF ANY FIRE RUNNING DOWN THE SIDE OF A HILL IN THE EVENING OF A DAMP DAY WHEN THE CLOUDS ARE UPON THE DESCENT AND THE SEABREEZE IS OCCASIONED BY THE CLOUDS ASCENDING IN THE DAYTIME WHICH MUST IMPEL THE INCUMBENT AIR UPWARDS AND MAKE ROOM FOR THE SEABREEZE TO FLOW IN BUT BE SIDE THE MERE ASCENT OF CLOUDS THERE IS AN EXCEEDING GREATER QUANTITY OF VAPOUR RAISED FROM THE LAND THAN FROM THE SEA FOR THE SAME EXTENT OF LAND HAS AN EXCEEDING GREATER SURFACE THAN THE SAME EXTENT OF SEA WHICH MAY APPEAR FROM THE VARIOUS FORMS OF VEGETABLES AND ANIMALS C AND THE GREATER THE SUR FACE THE GREATER WILL THE EVAPORATION BE BESIDE THE MORE IRREGULAR THESE SURFACES ARE THE GREATER WILL BE THE147 THE REFLECTION AND REFRACTION OF THE SUNS BEAMS WHICH WILL INCREASE THEIR POWER AND IT IS ALSO NE CESSARY THAT THE EVAPORATION SHOULD BE MUCH GREATER FROM VEGETABLE AND ANIMAL FLUIDS THAN FROM FLUIDS IN A QUIESCENT STATE TO CARRY ON A CIRCULATION FOR THE GREAT WORK OF NUTRITION BUT OF THIS WHEN I COME TO SPEAK OF VEGETATION AND ANIMAL LIFE NOW THE ASCENT OF THESE VAPOURS MUST BEGET A CIRCULATION OF THE AIR INWARD FROM THE SEA IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE ASCENT OF VAPOURS FROM ANY FIRE BRINGS IN THE AIR BELOW TO THAT FIRE AS TO WATERSPOUTS I HAVE FOUND THEM ODDLY DE SCRIBED BY THE LEARNED AS BEING GREAT COLUMNS OF WA TER SUCKED UP FROM THE SEA BY THE CLOUDS BUT I NEVER SAW ANY SUCH NOR COULD I FIND UPON INQUIRY FROM MANY HONEST MEN WHO HAVE SAILED ALMOST ALL OUR KNOWN SEAS THAT THEY EVER MET ANY SUCH AND THEREFORE I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ANY SUCH THERE IS INDEED AN APPEARANCE SOMETHING LIKE THEIR DESCRIPTION WHICH MAY HAVE GIVEN RISE TO THEIR CON JECTURES BUT THIS IS NO MORE THAN A VERY HEAVY SHOWER FROM A VERY DENSE CLOUD WHICH IS DRAWN IN TO A CONICAL FORM AND A VERY NARROW COMPASS AT BOTTOM BEFORE IT ARRIVES AT THE SEA WHICH IT DASHES WITH GREAT VIOLENCE IN ITS FALL IT MAY BE WORTH THE WHILE TO INQUIRE HOW THE SHOWER COMES INTO THIS CONIC FORM WHICH I THINK IS CAUSED BY THE GENERAL ATTRACTION FOR WHILE THE VAPOURS FLOATED IN THE AIR BEING OF LIKE SPECIFIC GRAVITY THEY WERE EQUALLY ATTRACTED BY THE AIR AS BY ONE ANOTHER BUT WHEN THEIR SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS GREATLY INCREASED BY THEIR BEING FORMED INTO LARGER DROPS AND LETTING GO GREAT PART OF THAT ELECTRICAL FLUID WHICH BUOYD THEM UP U 2 AND148 AND THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF WATER FALLING IN THE CEN TER OF THE SHOWER THE EXTREMES MAY BE GREATLY AT TRACTED TO THE CENTER IN THEIR PASSAGE DOWNWARD THERE IS ONE OBJECTION WHICH MAY BE MADE TO ALL I HAVE BEEN SAYING OF THE WINDS AND WEATHER THAT IS THE GREAT DISTANCE OF THE TROPIC AND THAT THE WIND MUST BE A GREAT TIME IN COMING TO US FROM THENCE BUT THIS OBJECTION WILL LESSEN WHEN THE VELOCITY OF THE WIND IS CONSIDERED WHICH IN A FRESH GALE WILL MOVE A DEGREE IN TWO HOURS WHICH WILL SOON BRING IT FROM THE TROPIC TO US AND THIS VELOCITY AND A MUCH GREATER I PROVED BY A MACHINE WHICH I IN VENTED AND MADE IN THE YEAR 1733 TO GO UPON WHEELS BY THE FORCE OF WIND FOR I HAVE BEEN CAR RIED IN IT AT THE RATE OF MORE THAN A DEGREE IN TWO HOURS WHEN THE WIND WAS UPON THE BEAM THAT IS WHEN I COULD SAIL FORWARD OR BACKWARD UPON THE SAME TRACT WITH EQUAL FACILITY SO THAT MY MOTION GOING BEFORE THE WIND MUST HAVE BEEN MUCH GREATER WHICH I THEN NEGLECTED TO ESTIMATE AND NOW GENTLEMEN I FEAR TWO THINGS THAT I HAVE SAID TOO MUCH AND THAT I HAVE SAID TOO LITTLE FOR IF THIS LETTER APPEARS WITH THE SAME FACE OF TRUTH TO YOU AS IT DOES TO ME I HAVE OMITTED MANY THINGS FOR FEAR OF BEING TOO PROLIX WHICH I OUGHT TO HAVE ADDED BUT IF I HAVE WRITTEN WITHOUT A FOUNDATION IN TRUTH I MUST LONG BEFORE YOU COME TO THIS PART OF MY LETTER APPEAR PROLIX AND IMPERTINENT AND THERE FORE IT MAY BE TIME TO CONCLUDE BEFORE I DO WHICH I WILL ASSERT ONE THING THAT IS THAT IF ANY THING IN THIS LETTER IS FOUND WORTH YOUR ACCEPTANCE IT IS INTIRELY MY OWN FOR I HAVE NOT BORROWED A SINGLE HINT NO MORE I DID IN MY LETTER CONCERNING THE CAUSE149 CAUSE OF THUNDER FOR WHEN I WROTE THAT LETTER WHICH WAS ON THE 20TH OF SEPTEMBER 1751 I DID NOT KNOW THAT ANY ONE HAD THE LEAST CONJECTURE THAT THE ELECTRICAL FIRE WAS THE CAUSE OF THUNDER AND I TOLD MANY GENTLEMEN IN THIS KINGDOM IN THE BEGIN NING OF THE YEAR 1751 THAT I THOUGHT I HAD DISCO VERED THE REAL CAUSE OF THUNDER INDEED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MY SENDING THAT LETTER TO YOU ON THE 18TH OF JUNE 1752 I MET SOME ACCOUNTS IN OUR NEWSPAPERS THAT IRON BARS SOME HOW OR OTHER SET UP DURING THE TIME OF THUNDER WERE FOUND TO BE ELECTRIFIED BUT FROM THAT TIME TO THIS I KNOW NOTHING PARTICULAR OF THOSE OR ANY OTHER EXPERIMENTS ON THUNDERCLOUDS I WAITED THE PUBLISHING OF YOUR VOLUME OF TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR 1752 TO INFORM MYSELF OF THESE MAT TERS BUT I DO NOT FIND THAT IT IS YET COME TO OUR KINGDOM AS I AM NOT A PLAGIARY SO I WOULD NOT WILLINGLY BE THOUGHT ONE NOR SHOULD I VENTURE TO TROUBLE YOU WITH WHAT I THOUGHT YOU MAY HAVE BETTER FROM OTHER HANDS BUT AS THE MATTER OF THIS LETTER APPEARS NEW TO ME SO I VENTURE TO LAY IT BEFORE YOU WITHOUT ANY OTHER MOTIVE THAN TO ADD MY MITE IN THE INVESTIGAT ING TRUTH I AM GENTLEMEN YOUR MOST HUMBLE AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT HEN EELES MY150 MY FEAR OF TRESPASSING UPON YOUR PATIENCE HAD AL MOST MADE ME FORGET TO EXPLAIN HOW FAR THE WIND ASSISTS VAPOURS TO RISE IN GREATER QUANTITIES AND IN LESS TIME THAN THEY WOULD IN A QUIET AIR AND THIS OMISSION WOULD NOT BE EXCUSABLE BECAUSE BOTH THE LEARNED AND UNLEARNED HAVE OBSERVED THAT A GREATER QUANTITY OF VAPOUR IS CARRIED OFF IN DRY WINDY WEA THER THAN WHEN THE WEATHER IS CALM WHEN VA POURS ARE EMITTED IN GREAT PLENTY FROM THE SURFACE OF FLUIDS SUCH AS FROM A POT BEFORE IT BEGINS TO BOIL OR FROM THE SURFACE OF A BOWL OF HOT PUNCH C IT OFTEN HAPPENS THAT THEY CROUD EACH OTHER IN SUCH MANNER THAT THE SURROUNDING ELECTRICAL FLUID OF EACH PARTICLE IS COMPRESSED AND CANNOT OCCUPY THAT POR TION OF SPACE WHICH IS NECESSARY TO MAKE IT BUOY UP THE PARTICLE AND THUS THE PARTICLES FLOAT IN A STEAM JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUOR AND THEY ARE PREVENTED FROM FALLING BACK INTO THE LIQUOR BY THE ELECTRICAL FLUID ON THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUOR IN WHICH STATE NONE BUT THE UPPERMOST PARTICLES CAN ASCEND WHICH THEY DO BY THE ELASTICITY OF THE ELECTRICAL FLUIDS FORCING THEM UPWARDS TILL THEY HAVE ROOM FOR THE ELECTRICAL FLUID THOROUGHLY TO EXPAND ITSELF SO AS TO BE ABLE TO BUOY UP THE INCLOSED PARTICLE OF VAPOUR IN THIS STATE THE ASSISTANCE OF THE WIND WILL BE EASILY UNDERSTOOD FOR THE WIND BLOWING THE VAPOURS FROM THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUOR DISSIPATES THEM AND GIVES THEM ROOM TO ASCEND AND CLEARS THE SURFACE OF THE LIQUOR TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE SUCCEEDING VAPOURS TO ASCEND AND SO ON WHICH IN THIS CASE WILL GREATLY AID THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR AND THUS FAR I THINK THAT THE WIND ASSISTS IN THE ASCENT OF VAPOUR BUT NO FARTHER I HAVE151 I HAVE MENTIONED HOT LIQUORS ONLY BECAUSE THE STEAM IS MORE VISIBLE IN THEM NOT BUT THE SAME CASE OFTEN HAPPENS IN EVAPORATION WHERE WE CANNOT SO EASILY PERCEIVE IT L E T T E R III TO THE REVEREND THOMAS BIRCH D D SECRET R S S I R LISMORE IN IRELAND MARCH 31 1755 I RECEIVED YOUR OBLIGING LETTER OF THE  INSTANT OF WHICH I AM HIGHLY SENSI  ALWAYS BE SUBSERVIENT TO YOUR COM READ APRIL 2 Y ME THE HONOUR  TELL ME THAT THE ROYAL  DESIRE TO KNOW THE EXPERIMENTS BY WHICH I FOUND ALL ASCENDING VAPOURS AND EXHALATIONS TO BE ELECTRIFIED AT FIRST I ONLY SUPPOSED THEY MUST BE SO ACCORDING TO THE REASONINGS IN MY LETTER BUT UPON TRIAL WITH A VERY SIMPLE APPARATUS I HAD THE PLEASURE TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT THEY WERE SO I EXTENDED A FINE STRING OF SILK EIGHT FEET HORIZON TALLY AND FROM THE MIDDLE SUSPENDED TWO PIECES OF SUCH DOWN AS GROWS UPON OUR TURFBOGS BY TWO PIECES OF FINE SILK ABOUT TWELVE INCHES EACH IN LENGTH AND THEN BY RUBBING A PIECE OF SEALINGWAX ON MY WASTECOAT OVER MY SIDE I ELECTRIFIED THE PIECES OF DOWN AND THEN BROUGHT SUNDRY BURNING THINGS UNDER THEM SO AS TO LET THE SMOKE PASS IN GREAT PLENTY THROUGH AND ABOUT THEM TO TRY WHETHER THE ELECTRIC FLUID WOULD RUN OFF WITH THE SMOKE BUT I HAD152 I HAD THE PLEASURE TO SEE THAT THE DOWN WAS BUT A LITTLE AFFECTED BY THE PASSAGE OF THE SMOKE AND STILL REMAINED ELECTRIFIED I THEN BROUGHT SUNDRY STEAMS FROM THE SPOUT OF A BOILING TEAKETTLE AND OTHERWISE IN THE SAME MANNER AND STILL FOUND THAT THE DOWN REMAINED ELECTRIFIED I THEN BREATHED ON THEM IN GREAT PLENTY BUT FOUND THAT THE DOWN STILL REMAINED ELECTRIFIED I THEN JOINED THE PALMS OF MY HANDS TOGETHER WITH THE FINGERS EXTENDED PERPENDICULARLY UNDER THE DOWN WHICH STILL REMAINED ELECTRIFIED ALTHOUGH THE SUBTILE EFFLUVIA THROWN OFF BY PERSPIRA TION PASSED IN GREAT PLENTY THROUGH THE DOWN AS MAY APPEAR BY HOLDING ONE OR BOTH THE HANDS IN THE SAME MANNER UNDER ANY LIGHT MATTER FLOATING IN THE AIR WHICH WILL BE DRIVEN UPWARDS THEREBY WITH AS GREAT VELOCITY AS AN ELECTRIFIED FEATHER IS BY ANY ELEC TRIFIED BODY HELD UNDER IT IN SHORT I TRIED ALL THE VAPOURS AND EXHALATIONS I COULD THINK OF IN THE SAME MANNER AND WITH THE SAME SUCCESS I THEN WARMED A WINEGLASS AND WITH THE SKIRT OF MY COAT HELD INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE GLASS BETWEEN MY FINGERS AND THUMB I RUBBED THE GLASS BRISKLY ABOUT AND ELECTRIFIED THE DOWN AND FOUND ALL EX PERIMENTS ANSWER IN THE SAME MANNER AS THEY DID WITH THE WAX I MENTION THIS PARTICULAR BECAUSE SOME WRITERS ON ELECTRICITY HAVE SAID THAT THERE WERE TWO KINDS OF ELECTRICAL FIRE THE ONE RESINOUS AND THE OTHER VITREOUS BECAUSE LIGHT BODIES ELECTRIFIED BY GLASS ARE ATTRACTED BY ELECTRIFIED WAX C AND THOSE ELECTRIFIED BY RESINS ARE ATTRACTED BY GLASS BUT I THINK THESE DIFFERENT EFFECTS MUST ARISE FROM SOME DIFFERING QUALITIES IN THE RESIN AND GLASS WHICH HAVE POWER TO ACTUATE THIS FIRE DIFFERENTLY FOR IF THERE WERE153 WERE REALLY TWO DISTINCT SPECIES OF THIS FIRE OPPOSITE IN THEIR NATURE THE AFOREMENTIONED EXPERIMENTS WOULD HAVE A VERY DIFFERENT CONSEQUENCE FROM WHAT APPEARS FOR IF THE VAPOURS WERE IMPREGNATED BY THE VITREOUS FIRE THEY MUST ABSORB OR SOME WAY DISTURB THE RESINOUS FIRE WHICH ELECTRIFIES THE DOWN AND SO VICE VERSA BUT WE FIND THAT THE SAME VAPOUR WITH ITS ELECTRIC FIRE PASSES THROUGH THE ELECTRIFIED DOWN IN THE SAME MANNER WHETHER IT BE ELECTRIFIED BY GLASS OR RESIN BUT I WILL NOT DETAIN YOU ON THIS SUBJECT THE ELECTRICITY REMAINING IN THE ELECTRIFIED DOWN AFTER THESE EXPERIMENTS MADE IT APPEAR THAT THE SMOKE AND STEAMS MUST BE EITHER ELECTRICS OR NON ELECTRICS ELECTRIFIED IT WAS EASY TO SUPPOSE THEM NONELECTRICS AS THEY ARISE FROM NONELECTRIC BODIES AND THE MORE BECAUSE THE HIGHEST ELECTRICS BY A DIS CONTINUITY AND COMMINUTION OF THEIR PARTS LONG BE FORE THEY COME TO BE AS MINUTE AS THE PARTICLES OF ASCENDING VAPOUR BECOME NONELECTRICS OR CONDUC TORS OF ELECTRICITY FOR GLASS RESIN WAX C ALL BECOME NONELECTRIC EVEN IN FUSION BUT TO TRY WHETHER THE STEAMS C WERE NONELECTRICS I ONLY BEDEWD THE WAX AND GLASS WITH MY BREATH STEAMS C FROM MY HAND TO THE END OF THE WAX AND GLASS AND THEN TOUCHING THE ELECTRIFIED DOWN WITH THE END OF THE WAX OR GLASS I FOUND THAT THE ELECTRICAL FIRE IMMEDIATELY PASSED FROM THE DOWN INTO MY HAND THROUGH THE STEAMS C WHICH RESTED UPON THE WAX AND GLASS WHICH I THINK SUFFICIENTLY PROVES THE STEAMS C TO BE NONELECTRIC AND I THINK THAT IT AS PLAINLY APPEARS THAT THEY ARE ALL ELECTRIFIED WHILE ASCENDING BECAUSE THE ELECTRICAL FIRE IN THE DOWN VOL 49 X DOES154 DOES NOT JOIN WITH THEM IN THEIR PASSAGE THROUGH IT WHICH OTHERWISE IT WOULD DO WITH THEM OR ANY NONELECTRIC NOT ELECTRIFIED I MADE SOME OTHER EXPERIMENTS TO THIS PURPOSE BUT THESE PRINCIPALLY PERSUADED ME TO SAY THAT ALL ASCENDING VAPOURS AND EXHALATIONS WERE ELECTRIFIED BUT HOW FAR THEY WILL WEIGH WITH THE ROYAL SOCIETY I MUST LEAVE TO THEIR BETTER JUDGMENT I AM S I R YOUR MOST HUMBLE AND MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT HEN EELES P S I ELECTRIFIED THE DOWN BETWEEN EACH EXPE RIMENT XXVI

paratus show that the curve of carbon dioxide excretion during work closely resembles that of the pulse and that carbon dioxide is at least in part the cause of the secondary rise in the pulse rate observed by Bowen Dr W B Pillsbury detailed some experi ments on The Attention Wave as a Measure of Fatigue Not merely the daily rhythm of fatigue and practise of the typical morning and evening workers was reflected in the ratios of the period of visibility to the period of invisibility in the attention wave but the de gree of fatigue on days of severe work as compared with easy days had a corresponding variation in the fluctuation of attention In the morning practise shows itself in a con tinuous increase in efficiency through at least a considerable portion of the experiment while in the evening there is a decreasing effectiveness almost from the beginning As further substantiation of the theory that the attention wave is closely related to the Traube Hering or Mayer vasomotor waves it was noted that both have the same daily rhythm of length FREDERICK C NEWCOMBE Secretary DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE MORGAN ON EVOLUTION AND ADAPTATION To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I have always supposed that what are generally called La marckian views of evolution were considered with less prejudice by biologists in the United States than in England or Europe and that my own publications in support of such views were therefore likely to be known and read in America even if they were almost completely ignored by my own countrymen I find however that Dr Thomas Hunt Mor gan in his book Evolution and Adaptation which has just appeared makes no mention whatever of my book Sexual Dimorphism in the Animal Kingdom a Theory of the Origin of Secondary Sexual Characters which was published in London more than three years ago Any biologist American or other has a perfect right to reject all my conclusions N S VOL XIX No 471 but it seems to me that an author who de votes a great part of his book to the discussion of Darwins theory of sexual selection and the evolution of secondary sexual characters in en tire ignorance of thefacts and argumentswhich it cost me years of labor to collect and elabor ate lays himself open to the charge of writing without proper knowledge of the literature of his subject I have published the results of ex perimental work apart from this but the only reference Dr Morgan makes to it is to a popular article in Natural Science he has not apparently consulted the original memoirs Like other English writers it has been my ambition that my work should be known to the scientific public of the United States which is not only very intelligent but free from prej udices which are stronger than reason in Eng land I am much disappointed to find that my chief contribution to the investigation of evolution is so little known to American evo lutionists J T CUNNINGHAM ZOOLOGICAL SOCIETY 3 HANOVER SQUARE LONDON W MUTATION AND SELECTION IN reading Professor Morgans very inter esting and valuable book Evolution and Adaptation it is surprising to find that he apparently regards the theory of evolution by selection and DeVriess mutation theory as being to a degree in conflict The evolution which observation shows us has taken place is chiefly characterized by the fact that it has brought organisms into favor able relation with their environmental condi tions That this could have been secured by mutation unaided by selection seems alto gether unlikely In the case of the leaf butterflies of the genus Kallima the theory of evolution by mutation alone must assume that the remark able resemblance arose all at once by a single mutation or that there were a series of muta tions which for some unaccountable reason were of such a character as to make the re semblance to a leaf gradually grow more per fect though no selective action of the en vironment controlled this improvement in patternJANUARY 8 1904 The first assumption of the origin of the perfect leaf pattern by a single mutation is unsupported by evidence and to me seems very improbable That the resemblance arose by the cumulation of a series of mutations inde pendent of selection seems no less improbable for in this case we have either to assume some mysterious internal regulation of the muta tions directing them all in one direction or else we must assume that among the many possible mutations only those that were in the direction of closer imitation happened to occur The latter is of course practically impossible upon the theory of probabilities and the former leads us into a realm of darkness which we seem at present unable to explore If however there is reason to believe in such internal directive influence we are not justified in rejecting it because of our inability to study its nature and action I can not see that we have such evidence I have been impressed with the feeling that Professor Morgan has allowed his opposition to Darwins conception of evolution by the selection of favorable fluctuating variations to cause him to understate the importance of selection though in parts of his book he recog nizes that selection acts on mutants and va riants The Darwinian theory and the theory of evolution by selection are not identical yet Professor Mgorgan frequently refers to them as if they were so If mutations be distinct from fluctuating variations as our as yet very scanty evidence seems to suggest may be the case still both mutations and variations so far as we can see would be subject to selec tion The theory of selection is an explana tion of some of the phenomena of adaptation It is difficult to see that the mutation theory apart from selection aids us in understanding or imagining how this adaptation the most general phenomenon in organisms has been secured Mutation may be the mode of origin of certain useful qualities but it is difficult to see how it explains their retention and per fection The theory of selection makes no pretense to explain the origin of varieties or mutations It attempts to explain the adap tation of organisms to their conditions of life such adaptation resulting from the selection of those individuals which vary or mutate in useful directions The theory of selection begins where the theory of mutation leaves off Not even a combination of DeVriess muta tion theory with Weismanns theory of germ inal selection would give us without natural selection an explanation of progressive per fection of adaptation We should still need to add Niagelis or rather St George Mivarts perfecting principle The work of DeVries seems especially val uable since it brings to the front such ques tions as the following Are there mutations which are distinct from fluctuatingvariations  Are fluctuating varia tions restricted to rather narrow limits and are the larger variations which occur of a dif ferent sort establishing a new mean about which a new series of fluctuating variations cluster Are mutations or variations definite or indefinite Do they follow certain lines or do they occur in all directions If the direction of mutations or variations is wholly or in part predetermined what are these predetermining factors Are they in ternal involved in the nature of the organ ism or external environmental or both Is there a tendency in mutants or variants to revert toward the condition of the parent stock Are mutants or variants of one sort more or less fertile or more or less vigorous when bred together than when bred with the parent stock or with mutants or variants of another sort Does mutation or variation cause partial or complete segregation Are hybrids between mutants or variants of different sorts or between mutants or variants and the parent stock intermediate in character between the two parents or do they follow wholly or chiefly one parent If the latter which parent is followed in the several kinds of crosses Upon most of these points the observations of DeVries have an important bearing though without much further observation they do not decide them It seems possible that one of the most im SCIENCE 7576 SCIENCE portant results of the work carried on by and stimulated by DeVries will be to show another way in which partial segregation may be se cured and the theory of natural selection needs all the help it can get from segregation It should hardly be necessary to urge that in understanding the development of the con ditions which prevail today among organisms the problem of the origin of species seems of very secondary importance in comparison with the problem of the perfection of adaptation MAYNARD M METCALF THE WOMANS COLLEGE OF BALTIMORE WILBUR WRIGHTS SUCCESSFUL FLIGHT IN A MOTORDRIVEN AEROPLANE THE newspapers of December 18 contained the announcement that Wilbur Wright had flown a distance of three miles with an aero plane propelled by a 16horse power four cylinder gasoline motor the whole weighing more than 700 pounds To the average news paper reader this meant no more than similar statements previously made in the newspapers that men had flown in New York or St Louis or San Francisco But to the student of aeronautics and particularly to those who had followed the careful scientific experiments with aeroplanes which were being made by Or ville and Wilbur Wright it meantan epoch in the progress of invention and achievement perhaps as great as that when Stevenson first drove a locomotive along a railroad It meant that after ages of endeavor man had at last been able to support himself in the air as does a bird and to land in safety at a spot chosen in advance The report from an authoritative source confirms the fact of this flight but modifies the details somewhat from those given in the newspapers It appears that four successful flights were made in a motordriven aeroplane on December 17 near Kitty Hawk N C The wind was blowing about 21 miles an hour and a speed relative to the wind of 31 miles an hour was attained by the aeroplane This meant a speed of 10 miles an hour rela tive to the ground The aeroplane had a surface of 510 square feet and in the longest flight was in the air 57 seconds The aeroplane NS VOLXIX No 471 is said to have risen from a level The re ported distance of three miles was probably relative to the wind The earlier work of the Wright brothers is described in the reports of the Western So ciety of Engineers and in part republished in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Insti tution for 1902 Their invention of a for ward rudder has contributed to the final suc cess The modern success in aeronautics may be said I think to date from the feat of Otto Lilienthal in 1891 in gliding down an incline in an aeroplane These glides were repeated with much success and with an improvised aeroplane by Mr Chanute and Mr Herring in our own country Mr Herring even went so far as to carry with him 50 pounds of sand in his aeroplane which weight he computed would be that of an engine sufficient to support him Mr Pilcher in England repeated these ex periments on a level by rising into the air in his machine when drawn by a horse attached to a rope the machine rising like a kite and then gliding forward Mr Whitehead is de scribed in the Scientific American as having repeated this experiment recently in Connecti cut with a motor on board the aeroplane In the meantime in 1896 Dr Langley had driven a model weighing about 25 pounds through the air with a small steamengine and Sir Hiram Maxim had performed the wonder ful feat of lifting 7000 pounds into the air for a moment This was done with an aero plane having 5000 square feet of surface driven by serial screws attached to a steam engine of 360 horsepower and of extraordin ary lightness But notwithstanding all these partial suc cesses there was owing to the recently re ported failure of Dr Langley to lift a man and to other causes a wide skepticism as to the possibility of human flight Mr Wrights success in rising and landing safely with a motordriven aeroplane is a crowning achievement showing the possibility of human flight Much yet remains to be done but with the stimulus of this beginning progress will probably be rapid In the prog ress now achieved a great deal is due to Mr

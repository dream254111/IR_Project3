J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075939,ASTRONOMY,I244561,DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCES ASTRONOMY THE PRINCIPAL PAPER READ WAS THAT OF PROFESSOR G W MYERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO SCHOOL OF EDUCATION ON THE NEGLECT OF ASTRONOMY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL NUMEROUS SPECIES OF APPARATUS CONSTRUCTED IN PART BY THE MEMBERS OF A HIGH SCHOOL CLASS WERE SHOWN TO ILLUSTRATE THE POINTS EMPHASIZED IN THE PAPER IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWED THE ARGUMENT WAS STRONGLY BROUGHT FORWARD THAT UNDER THE PRESENT CONDITIONS THE TEACHER COULD NOT AFFORD TO PUT SO MUCH TIME INTO THE BUILDING OF APPARATUS AND INTO OUTOFDOOR OBSERVATIONS AS REQUIRED PROFESSOR MEYERS PAPER WAS AS FOLLOWS THE DOCTRINE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE TEACHING IN PRIMARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION HAS HAD NUMEROUS FRIENDS AND FOES SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF SPENCERS EDUCATION OF LATE YEARS THE DOCTRINE HAS BEEN TIGHTENING ITS HOLD ON THE MINDS OF PRACTICAL AMERICAN EDUCATORS THE GRADUAL DRIFTING OF PRAC TICAL EDUCATION TOWARD A STILL GREATER INCREASE OF EMPHASIS IN ELE MENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS UPON NATURESTUDY AND ELEMENTARY SCIENCE AS A CONTROLLING FACTOR OF AMERICAN EDUCATION IS PERCEPT IBLE IN ALMOST EVERY MODERN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION THE CONCEP TION OF THE PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE OF THE STUDY OF THE MOTHER TONGUEA CONCEPTION INHERITED A FEW YEARS SINCE FROM POLYGLOT EUROPEIS WEAKENING AND IS BEING SUPERCEDED BY THE VIEW THAT THE CHILD USES HIS MOTHERTONGUE AS UNCONSCIOUSLY AS HE USES THE AIR HE BREATHES AND THAT PROBLEMS CONNECTED WITH HIS MOTHERTONGUE SEEM TO HIM ARTIFICIAL AND EVEN TRUMPED UP IF THE EXPRESSION MAY BE PARDONED THE FORCE OF CURRENT ARGU MENTS FOR THE IMPORTANCE OF A TRAINING IN CLEAR FORCEFUL AND IDIOMATIC EXPRESSION OF THOUGHT IN THE MOTHERTONGUE IS PRACTI CALLY NIL WHEN CONSIDERED ENTIRELY APART FROM A DIRECT AND VERY PARTICULAR REGARD TO THE CHARACTER OF THE IDEAS TO BE EXPRESSED 29THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE WRITERS EXPERIENCE MAY BE EXCEPTIONAL BUT SO FAR AS HE IS ABLE TO ATTRIBUTE TO HIS SCHOOL TRAINING DEFINITE AND CERTAIN CREDIT FOR WHAT HAS BEEN HELPFUL TO HIM IN AFTERLIFE IT MUST BE RECKONED MAINLY TO THE SCORE OF CLEAR DEFINITE AND PERTINENT IDEAS AND TO THE POWER TO DRAW IMMEDIATE AND WELLWARRANTED INFERENCES FROM THOSE IDEAS GIVEN A BODY OF CLEARLYCONCEIVED IDEAS IN WHICH THE STUDENT HAS A SPONTANEOUS AND VITAL INTEREST AND MOST OF THE DIFFICULTY OF THE TEACHERS PROBLEM OF SECURING CLEAR ACCURATE AND FORCEFUL EXPRESSION DISAPPEARS IS NOT THE CONCEPTION OF THE SUPREME IMPORTANCE IN EDUCATION OF EXPRESSION IN THE FORM OF LANGUAGE A SURVIVAL OF THE PERIOD WHEN THE SOLE MEANS OF CARRYING ON INSTRUCTION WAS BY WORD OF MOUTH IS THERE NOT IN THE CURRENT TEACHING OF ENGLISH COMPOSITION A PAIN FUL SURFEIT OF EFFORT SPENT ON THE ATTEMPT TO TRAIN STUDENTS TO WRITE BRILLIANT LITTLE SKITS ABOUT NOTHING IN PARTICULAR FAVORITE THEMES ARE HOW MY WASHING CAME HOME COLLEGE SLANG AND THE TALE OF AN OLD SHOE ANYTHING SEEMS TO GO AS SUBJECTMATTER FOR TRAINING IN ENGLISH IN MANY WAYS THE DISPOSITION TO TREAT TRIFLING SUBJECTS POMP OUSLY AND ATTRACTIVELY IS DIRECTLY ANTAGONISTIC TO THE FORMATION OF SCIENTIFIC HABITS OF THOUGHT WHICH SEEK TO STATE THE GREATEST POS SIBLE AMOUNT OF TRUTH IN THE FEWEST SIMPLE TERSE AND TRANSPARENT TERMS THE NEWSPAPER REPORTORIAL STATE OF MIND IS AN END OF DOUBTFUL EDUCATIONAL VALUE EVERY SCIENCETEACHER KNOWS THE DIFFICULTY OF GETTING STUDENTS TO WEIGH THE RELATIVE IMPORT OF IDEAS AND TO WRITE OF THEM WITH DUE REGARD TO BALANCE AND PRO PORTION BALANCE AND PROPORTION ARE NOT SO MUCH A MATTER OF PARAGRAPHING AS OF THINKING THE HABIT OF SPREADING TRIFLING IDEAS OVER SEVERAL PAGES OF FOOLSCAP IS POSITIVELY DETRIMENTAL TO THE FORMATION OF THESE SCIENTIFIC HABITS THE KNOT TO THE PEDA GOGICAL PROBLEM OF TEACHING GOOD ENGLISH IS FIRST TIED AND THEN DRAWN INTO A DISTRESSINGLY HARD ONE BY THE PEDAGOGUE HIMSELF BY AN ARTIFICIAL REVERSAL OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF ATTAINING THOSE ENDS IN REAL LIFE IN WHICH CONSISTS THE VERY REASON FOR THE IMPORT ANCE OF A RATIONAL TRAINING OF THE POWER OF CLEAR ACCURATE AND FORCEFUL EXPRESSION IN ACTUAL LIFE THE ACQUISITION OF IMPORTANT IDEAS ON IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IS FIRST AND FOREMOST AND THE NEED 30DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCES OF COMMUNICATING THEM TO OUR FELLOWS IN CLEAR SIMPLE AND FORCEFUL LANGUAGE IS THE SECOND STEP THE SECOND STEP IS MADE NECESSARY OF COURSE BECAUSE CONCERT OF ACTION AMONG MEN IS THE ONLY MEANS OF REALIZING IN PRACTICE THE CONSEQUENCES OF OUR THINKING THE POINT HERE INSISTED UPON HOWEVER IS THAT CLEAR ACCURATE AND FORCEFUL IDEAS FURNISH THE CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO CLEAR ACCURATE AND FORCEFUL EXPRESSION SPEAKING MORE ASTRO NOMICALLY OVEREMPHASIS OF ENGLISH TEACHING BY THE USE OF TRASHY OR INCONSEQUENTIAL SUBJECTS LOOKS IN AT THE WRONG END OF THE PEDAGOGICAL TELESCOPE NATURAL PROPORTION AND PERSPECTIVE ARE THUS LOST TO THE STUDENT AND THE POWER OF ESTIMATING REAL VALUES IS DISTORTED IF NOT DESTROYED RESULTS APPROXIMATING THE GROTESQUE ARE THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF SUCH PROCEDURE IT IS FOR THOSE OF US WHO ARE ENGAGED IN ACTUAL TEACHING TO REMIND OURSELVES OFTEN THAT MOST OF THE ADVANCE WHICH THE RACE HAS MADE HAS ARISEN FROM THE NEW IDEAS THAT MEN HAVE DISCOVERED MASTERED AND APPLIED AND NOT FROM THE MERE POLISHING OF THE MEANS OF EXPRESSING THEM IN LANGUAGE FREE AND FACILE POWER OF EXPRESSING THESE IDEAS HAVE OF COURSE GREATLY AIDED THEIR INTRODUCTION AND ACCEPTANCE BUT JUST NOW IT IS A QUESTION OF WHERE THE EMPHASIS SHOULD REST IN THE EARLY MORE SIGNIFICANT AND MORE DIFFICULT STAGES OF SCHOOL WORK SHOULD IT REST ON THE STIMULATION OF CLEAR WORTHY AND DISTINCT IDEAS OF SOME USEFUL SORT AND ON THE AROUSING OF AN INTEREST IN THEM WHERE THE NOR MAL INTEREST DOES NOT ALREADY EXIST OR SHOULD IT REST UPON THE CLEAR SIMPLE AND FORCEFUL STATEMENT OF THESE IDEAS IN LANGUAGE WITH BUT SECONDARY REGARD TO THE NATURE OF THESE IDEAS  EVI DENTLY BOTH ARE OF GREAT IMPORTANCE STILL IT IS NOT AT ALL THE OLD QUESTION WHICH IS THE MORE IMPORTANT EATING OR SLEEPING IT IS RATHER WHICH IS OF FIRST IMPORTANCE TO THE BABE FOOD OR EXERCISE  TO RAISE THE QUESTION IS TO ANSWER IT MANUAL TRAINING WHICH HAS ALREADY PASSED THE STAGE OF BEING LOOKED UPON AS A FAD AND IS WE BELIEVE IN THE SCHOOLS TO STAY HAS TO BE CREDITED AMONG OTHER OF ITS PEDAGOGIC CONTRIBUTIONS WITH DEMONSTRATING THAT IDEAS MAY BE CLEARLY FORMED AND FORCE FULLY APPLIED WITHOUT LANGUAGE AND MOREOVER THAT WHEN IDEAS ARE CLEARLY CONCEIVED THEY BE CLEARLY AND EASILY EXPRESSED LET 31THE SCHOOL REVIEW US HAVE IN THE SCHOOLS A SEASON OF INSISTENCE UPON THOUGHTSTUFF HAVING A RICH AND VARIED CONTENT AND UNDERTAKE FOR A TIME TO SECURE EXPRESSIONAS NOWADAYS WE SECURE SO MANY OTHER GOOD THINGS IN EDUCATIONINCIDENTALLY THE ADVOCATES OF THE OVERMASTERING IMPORTANCE IN SCHOOL WORK OF A STUDY OF LANGUAGE ARE MUCH GIVEN TO POINTING SCORN FULLY AT THE MEAGER RESULTS TO SHOW FOR THE TIME AND ENERGY PUT UPON THE MATHEMATICAL STUDIES IN THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS BUT ARE OUR COLLEGE BOYS AND GIRLS SPEAKING AND WRIT ING CORRECT ELEGANT AND FORCEFUL ENGLISH EVEN IN CASES IN WHICH THEY HAVE COME UP TO US THROUGH THE HEAVY COURSES OF ENGLISH WE HAVE OF LATE REQUIRED THEM TO GO THROUGH IT MUST BE ADMITTED I THINK THAT HERE TOO THE RESULTS ARE DISAPPOINTING OFTEN PAINFULLY SO NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT ENGLISH COURSES ARE OF MUCH LESS INHERENT DIFFICULTY THAN ARE MATHEMATICAL COURSES BUT IMPROVEMENT CAN HARDLY COME FROM CHARGES AND COUNTER CHARGES OF DISAPPOINTMENT AND OF PEDAGOGIC DELINQUENCY THE MAIN POINT TO BE INSISTED UPON HERE IS THAT BOYS AND GIRLS SHOULD BE GIVEN SOMETHING INTERESTING TO THINK AND WRITE ABOUT BEFORE THEY SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO DO MUCH VITAL THINKING OR FORCEFUL WRITING OR SPEAKING EXPRESSION AND THOUGHT EXPRESSED MUST NOT QUARREL BUT HARMONIZE VEHEMENT UTTERANCE AND OVERDRAWN DESCRIPTION ARE NOT GUARANTEES OF VIGOROUS THINKING IMMODERATE EXPRESSION IMPLIES INTEMPERATE JUDGMENT THIS IS THE IDEA WHICH IS RAPIDLY CREATING A MORE PROGRESSIVE ATTITUDE OF THE GENERAL MIND TOWARD SCIENCE WORK IN THE SCHOOLS THE SUBJECT OF THE RIGHT SORT OF SCHOOL SCIENCE HAS THE GREAT ADVANTAGE OVER ALL OTHER SUBJECTMATTERS OF BRINGING BEFORE THE IMMATURE MINDS OF BOYS AND GIRLS A BODY OF CLEAR CONCRETE REAL ORIGINAL AND EASILY RELATABLE IDEAS ABOUT THINGS EMBRACING SO WIDE AND VARIED A RANGE OF INTEREST AS TO AROUSE THE SPONTANEOUS ACTIVITY OF ALMOST EVERY TYPE OF NORMAL MIND IN FACT IT GOES FAR TOWARD NORMALIZ ING MINDS WHICH HAVE BEEN ARTIFICIALIZED BY THE UNNATURAL METHODS OF SOME OF THE OTHER HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS THIS IS NOT THE LEAST OF ITS FUNCTIONS IN THE SECONDARYSCHOOL WORK OF TODAY BUT STRANGE TO SAY IN THE MIDST OF A PERIOD OF UNPARALLELED INTEREST IN HIGHSCHOOL SCIENCE WORK WE SEE A GENERAL DISPOSITION 32DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCESASTRONOMY TO DROP ASTRONOMY FROM THE CURRICULUM CERTAINLY IT BEHOOVES THOSE WHO ARE DIRECTLY CONCERNED WITH THE TEACHING OF ASTRONOMY IN ANY PART OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM TO INQUIRE INTO THE CAUSES FOR THIS TENDENCY AND SO FAR AS LIES IN THEIR POWER TO SEEK TO DIS COVER AND TO REMOVE THE CAUSES HOWEVER HUMILIATING IT MAY SEEM TO CONFESS IT IT IS UNFORTUNATELY TRUE THAT THERE EXIST THE STRONGEST REASONS FOR BELIEVING THAT CURRENT TEACHING OF ASTRONOMY IS LARGELY TO BLAME FOR THE GENERAL TENDENCY OF SCHOOL OFFICERS TO LEAVE THE SUBJECT OUT OF THE COURSES OF THE HIGH SCHOOL AS A MATTER OF FACT THE TEACHING OF ASTRONOMY IN HIGH SCHOOLS IS IN THE SOREST NEED OF STUDY IN THE LIGHT OF RECENT EDUCATIONAL ADVANCE ONE REASON WHY THIS PECULIARLY INTERESTING AND IMPOR TANT SCIENCE EDUCATIONALLY CONSIDERED IS NOT RECEIVING THE ATTEN TION IT DESERVES OF SCHOOL MEN LIES IN THE FACT THAT ASTRONOMY AS TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOLS DOES NOT DEAL WITH WHAT ARE LOOKED UPON AS THE CHIEF CONCERNS OF EVERYDAY PEOPLE BUT A REASON MORE DAMAGINGLY OPERATIVE LIES IN STUPID AND STUPEFYING WAYS OF TEACHING IT IF A STUDENT DOES NOT LIKE MY SUBJECT SAYS ONE WHY THEN LET HIM DROP IT HE DOES NOT HAVE TO KNOW ASTRON OMY SUCH SENTIMENTS HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO PASS MUSTER TOO LONG AMONG INDOLENT HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS A TEACHER HAS NO RIGHT TO THE ATTITUDE ILL DO A GOOD HONEST DAYS WORK AND LET RESULTS TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES HIS PRIME BUSINESS IS PRECISELY TO BRING RESULTS ABOUT NO TEACHER OF ASTRONOMY WORTHY EITHER OF HIS SCIENCE OR OF HIS CALLING EVER STOOPED TO THE USE OF THESE SENTIMENTS OF COURSE BUT THE WIDELY PREVALENT THOUGH EXCEED INGLY ERRONEOUS NOTION THAT ASTRONOMY IS OF VALUE TO BUT A COM PARATIVELY FEW PECULIARLY ENDOWED PERSONS ALLOWS THE SCIENCE TO STAND APART FROM ITS FELLOWSCIENCES AS BELONGING TO THE CATEGORY OF SUBJECTS WITH REGARD TO WHICH THE SCHOOL CAN AFFORD TO MAIN TAIN AN ATTITUDE OF INDIFFERENCE THEN THIS MISTAKEN VIEW IS FED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS DO NOT HANDLE THE SUBJECT BY METHODS IN ANY WAY ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH THE OTHER HIGHSCHOOL SCIENCES HAVE SHOWN TO BE INDISPENSABLE TO PROFITABLE SCIENCE STUDY HOW EASY IT IS FOR US TO FORGET THAT PHYSICS COURSES AND CHEMISTRY COURSES ARE NOT IN THE HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM PRIMA 337HE SCHOOL REVIEW RILY TO MAKE PHYSICISTS AND CHEMISTS NONE OF US FAIL TO ADMIT ON SECOND THOUGHT AT LEAST THAT THESE SUBJECTS FULLY JUSTIFY THEIR EVERINCREASING DEMANDS FOR TIME AND FOR FULLER RECOGNITION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL PRIMARILY BECAUSE TREATED BY MODERN METHODS THEY CONTRIBUTE POWERFULLY TO THE TRAINING OF YOUTH INTO SCIENTIFIC METHODS 6F STUDY AND OF THOUGHT TEACHERS OF THESE SCIENCES HAVE LEARNED TO A VERY CONSIDERABLE DEGREE HOW TO PRESENT THE TRUTHS OF THESE SCIENCES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NEWTONIAN LAW OF MODERN PEDAGOGY WE LEARN BY DOING THEY NO LONGER STAND ON THE RESPECTABLE BUT VERY DECREPIT AND VERY UNAMERICAN DOGMA TEACH THE SUBJECT NO MATTER WHETHER ANYONE LEARNS ANYTHING THEY HAVE LEARNED THE PRACTICAL TRUTH THAT THE TEACHING ACT IS ABORTIVE AND EVEN WORSE THAN USELESS UNLESS SOMEONE LEARNS TEACHERS OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY PRETTY GENERALLY TAKE THEIR SUBJECTS AND THEIR STUDENTS SERIOUSLY HOLD ING THEMSELVES RESPONSIBLE FOR A TANGIBLE RESULT EXCELLENT COURSES IN THESE SUBJECTS HAVE ACCORDINGLY BEEN THOUGHT OUT FOR THE SECONDARY GRADES THE PUBLIC HAS AS A CONSEQUENCE CON CEIVED AN ARDENT INTEREST IN THE EXPERIMENTAL WORK OF THESE SCI ENCES AS SCHOOL SUBJECTS BECAUSE THEY STAND FOR THE BEST TRAINING FOR THE WORK OF MODERN LIFE INDEED SCIENCE WORK IN THE HIGH SCHOOL TO THE COMMON MIND MEANS PHYSIOGRAPHY PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY EXCLUSIVELY SCIENTIFIC METHODS OF THOUGHTWHICH MEANS THE METHODS OF THESE THREE SCIENCESPASS AS LEGAL TENDER IN EVERY VOCATION AND AVOCATION OF ACTUAL LIFE THIS IS NO LONGER DISPUTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE DONE SOME OF IT THE MOST THAT FORMER FOES OF SCIENCE ARE NOW SEEKING TO PROVE BY THEIR A PRIORI ARGUMENTS IS THAT OTHER SUBJECTS IF STUDIED SCIENTIFICALLY ARE EQUALLY VALUABLE EDUCATIONALLY IT IS SURPRISING TO THE POINT OF ASTONISHMENT THAT THE DEVELOP MENT OF COURSES IN ASTRONOMY FOR THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAS NOT KEPT PACE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF COURSES IN PHYSICS AND CHEM ISTRY FIFTY YEARS AGO ASTRONOMY HAD THE DECIDED ADVANTAGE OF THESE SOCALLED MODERN COURSES IN THE SCHOOLS AS A RULE ASTRON OMY IS NOW STUDIED IN THE HIGH SCHOOL ALMOST WHOLLY FROM THE TEXTBOOK A COLLEGE PROFESSOR OF ASTRONOMY TOLD THE WRITER ONLY THE OTHER DAY THAT HE COULD NOT TELL THE DIFFERENCE IN HIS 34DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCESASTRONOMY COLLEGE CLASSES BETWEEN STUDENTS WHO HAD AND STUDENTS WHO HAD NOT TAKEN A HIGHSCHOOL COURSE IN ASTRONOMY SO LITTLE HAD THE FORMER PROFITED BY THEIR HIGHSCHOOL WORK HE ALSO STATED THAT AS ASTRONOMY IS TAUGHT IN HIGH SCHOOLS IT IS POSITIVELY OF NO VALUE AT ALL AND THAT IT EVEN WENT FAR TOWARD KILLING WHAT LITTLE NORMAL INTEREST THE STUDENT ONCE HAD FOR THE SCIENCE IS IT NOT HIGH TIME THAT THE GENERAL INDIFFERENCE TOWARD ASTRONOMY BE GIVEN OUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION  THE AVER SION AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS IS NOT CONFINED TO STUDENTS HAVING A DISTASTE FOR SCIENCE THE WRITER HAS HEARD MANY STUDENTS WHO PROFESSED THE DEEPEST INTEREST IN CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS EXPRESS A DECIDED DISLIKE FOR ASTRONOMY AS IT HAD BEEN TAUGHT THEM IN HIGH SCHOOLS TO AN INQUIRY AMONG HIGHSCHOOL PRINCIPALS AS TO THE REASON WHY ASTRONOMY IS NOT MORE GENERALLY STUDIED IN HIGH SCHOOLS THE REPLIES PRETTY GENERALLY DIVIDE INTO TWO CLASSES ONE CLASS SAY MERELY THAT ASTRONOMY IS OF LITTLE BREADANDBUTTER VALUE TO PEOPLE AND THE OTHER AND MUCH LARGER CLASS CLAIM THE LACK OF ATTENTION TO IT IN THEIR SCHOOLS TO BE DUE TO ARCHAIC AND UNSCIENTIFIC METHODS OF TEACHING IT THEY CLAIM QUITE GENERALLY THAT THEY CANNOT GET IT WELL TAUGHT THEY SAY IT IS BAD ENOUGH TO TEACH UNSCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS BY TEXTBOOK ALONE BUT THAT IT IS POSITIVELY INTOLERABLE IN THIS AGE TO TEACH A SCIENCE BY NON SCIENTIFIC METHODS THE TIMEHONORED CLAIM OF FRIENDS OF ASTRONOMY THAT ITS INFLUENCE IS DECENTRALIZING AND BROADENING TO THE INDIVIDUAL NO LONGER APPEALS TO THE PRINCIPAL OF A HIGH SCHOOL WHO KNOWS THAT AS THE SUBJECT IS TAUGHT IT MAKES NO VITAL APPEAL TO THE STUDENTIN FACT THAT IT DOES NOT TAKE HOLD OF HIS THOUGHT PROCESSES AT ALL FROM SOME FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS THE WRITER IS LED TO BELIEVEIN THE LIGHT OF WHAT INTELLI GENT CITIZENS ARE DEMANDINGTHAT PRINCIPALS OF SCHOOLS ARE IN LARGE MEASURE JUSTIFIED IN THROWING THE SUBJECT OUT OF THE CURRICULA AND USING THE TIME THUS GAINED FOR THE BETTER THOUGHTOUT AND MORE MODERN COURSES IN PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY FELLOWTEACHERS AND LOVERS OF ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE WE HAVE TO FACE THE QUESTION WHAT OUGHT TO BE DONE ABOUT IT BUT YOU INSIST THE LOGICAL PROCEDURE WOULD BE TO SECURE 35THE SCHOOL REVIEW TEACHERS WHO CAN AND WILL HANDLE THE SUBJECT IN A SCIENTIFIC WAY THIS REMEDY HOWEVER LIKE MANY ANOTHER REMEDY FOR FAULTY SCHOOL WORK IS NOT SO EASY TO ADMINISTER FIRST BECAUSE THE PRIMARY INTEREST OF THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY TEACHING ASTRONOMY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL IS USUALLY IN SOME OTHER SUBJECT AS MATHE MATICS OR PHYSICS THE ASTRONOMY TEACHERS WORK IN HIS FAVORITE SUBJECT IS OFTEN OF A HIGH GRADE OF EXCELLENCE AND THE SCHOOL COULD ILL AFFORD TO DISPENSE WITH HIS SERVICES IN THESE LINES IN THE SECOND PLACE IT IS LESS EXPENSIVE LESS DISTURBING AND MORE CONSONANT WITH THE INERTIA OF CIRCUMSTANCES TO LET A MORIBUND SUBJECT DIE THAN TO UNDERTAKE TO REJUVENATE IT NOBODY SEEMS TO CARE MUCH FOR IT SO WHY WASTE ENERGY UPON IT IN THE THIRD PLACE TEXTS AND TEACHERS FOR THE SCIENTIFIC TREATMENT OF SCHOOL ASTRONOMY ARE NEITHER PLENTIFUL NOR INCREASING PUBLISHERS REMIND US THAT THE HIGHSCHOOL AUDIENCE FOR ASTRONOMY IS SMALL AND ON THE RAPID WANE OTHER REASONS WILL READILY OCCUR TO ALL BUT THOSE ENUMERATED SEEM TO BE MOST EFFICIENT IN CONTRIBUTING TO THE NEGLECT OF ASTRONOMY A FEW BELIEVERS IN THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF RIGHTLY TAUGHT ASTRONOMY ARE DISPOSED TO CHIDE THE PHYSICS CHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOGRAPHY FOR APPROPRIATING TO THEMSELVES THE LIONS SHARE OF THE TIME ALLOTMENT TO SCIENCE ON THE HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAM THE WRITER IS HOWEVER INCLINED TO THE OPINION THAT THE TROUBLE LIES DEEPER AND THAT THE APPARENT CROWDING OUT IS RATHER A CASE OF THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST AND THAT IT MUST GO ON AT AN ACCELERATED RATE UNTIL ASTRONOMICAL METHOD ADAPTS ITSELF MORE PERFECTLY TO MODERN CONDITIONS AND TO MODERN EDUCATIONAL IDEAS AN EXAMINATION OF THE REASONS ENUMERATED WILL SHOW THAT EVERY ONE OF THEM CAN BE REMOVED BY EARNEST AND CONCERTED EFFORT ON THE PART OF THOSE WHO LOVE ASTRONOMICAL SCIENCE WHO CAN TEACH ASTRONOMY AND WHO WISH TO TEACH IT IN SUCH A WAY AS TO ENABLE THE STUDENT TO DERIVE FROM IT ITS FULLEST EDUCATIONAL VALUE IS THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RESURRECTION AND REHABILITATION IN THE HIGH SCHOOL OF THIS TIMETRIED AND TRULY WORTHY SUBJECT NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO INDUCE THIS CONFERENCE TO TAKE THE INITIAL STEPS TODAY LOOKING TOWARD BRINGING ABOUT THIS END 36DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCESASTRONOMY BUT WHILE THE PROBLEM OF REVIVING THE INTEREST IN ASTRONOMY IS NOT AN EASY ONE AND CAN BE SATISFACTORILY SOLVED ONLY BY CON CERTED EFFORT STILL THERE ARE SOME ELEMENTS OF THE SOLUTION WHICH ARE SO CONSPICUOUSLY FUNDAMENTAL THAT EVEN ISOLATED EFFORTS WILL BE OF VALUE THE PSYCHIC ACTS OF OBSERVATION COMPARISON DIS CRIMINATION CLASSIFICATION GENERALIZATION AND FINALLY OF DEDUC TION SO INDISPENSABLE TO ALL REAL SCIENCE WORK WHICH IS DIRECTED TOWARD AN EDUCATIONAL END ARE BUT VERY FEEBLY APPEALED TO IF AT ALL BY PURE TEXTBOOK METHODS IMAGINATION AND MEMORY ALONE RECEIVE ATTENTION IN CURRENT HIGHSCHOOL ASTRONOMY BUT EVEN THE IMAGINATION SHOULD START FROM FACTS CLEARLY THOUGHT OUT NOR SHOULD THE MEMORY BE BURDENED WITH UNDIGESTED MATE RIALS SWALLOWED ON FAITH ALONE HOWEVER IMPORTANT THE CULTIVA TION OF MEMORY AND OF THE SCIENTIFIC IMAGINATION MAY BE IT IS TRUE THAT THESE FACULTIES ARE ONLY THE SERVANTS OF THE REASONING FACULTIES AND MUST NEVER BE EXALTED INTO MATTERS OF EXCLUSIVE OR EVEN OF CHIEF CONCERN IN SCIENCE STUDY MOREOVER THERE ARE SO MANY OTHER SUBJECTS IN THE HIGH SCHOOL WHICH EXERCISE THE MEMORY AND THE IMAGINATION THAT ASTRONOMY CAN SCARCELY HOPE TO ESTABLISH FOR ITSELF A PECULIAR PLACE IN THE HIGH SCHOOL ON THE BASIS OF PECULIAR MERIT AS A MEMORY AND IMAGINATION TRAINER IT IS MY PURPOSE BRIEFLY TO POINT OUT HERE HOW BY A LITTLE INGENUITY AND INDUSTRY ON THE TEACHERS PART ASTRONOMY MAY WITH ALMOST NO EXPENSE BE TREATED AS A SCIENCE BY HIGHSCHOOL CLASSES I MAY BE ALLOWED TO PREFACE MY MORE SPECIFIC REMARKS AS TO WAYS OF CONDUCTING OBSERVATIONAL AND EXPERIMENTAL WORK WITH A STATEMENT OF WHAT SEEMS TO ME SHOULD BE ATTEMPTED AS A PRACTICAL MEANS OF RESTORING ASTRONOMY TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE IN THE SCHOOLS FIRST I WOULD ADVISE AN OBSERVATIONAL COURSE OF WORK HAVING TO DO WITH THE STUDY OF THE MORE OBVIOUS CELESTIAL BODIES AND MOVEMENTS WITH A VIEW OF GIVING THE PUPIL SOME FIRSTHAND KNOWLEDGE OF THOSE FACTS OF ASTRONOMY WHICH LIE WITHIN THE REACH OF THE NAKED EYE AND OF A TWELVEWEEK COURSE OF STUDY THE CONNECTION OF THE OBSERVED MOVEMENTS WITH THE FAMILIAR CHANGES OF DAY AND NIGHT AND OF THE SEASONS WOULD BE INVOLVED THE COURSE WOULD CONSIST OF A GOOD DEAL OF WHAT IS COMMONLY 37THE SCHOOL REVIEW KNOWN AS MATHEMATICAL GEOGRAPHY AND OF THE GEOGRAPHY OF THE HEAVENS OR CONSTELLATION STUDY A READY KNOWLEDGE OF THE MOST EASILY IDENTIFIABLE OBJECTS AND MOTIONS ON THE SKY SHOULD BE THE AIM SECOND THIS TWELVE OR THIRTEENWEEK COURSE WOULD BE FOL LOWED BY ANOTHER OF ABOUT THE SAME LENGTH DEALING IN A LABORA TORY OR EXPERIMENTAL WAY WITH THE PHYSICAL LAWS WHICH UNDERLIE THE MOST FAMILIAR CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE LIGHT AND DISTRIBUTION OF LIFE ON THE TERRESTRIAL GLOBE IT WOULD BE CONDUCTED PRECISELY AS A MODERN HIGHSCHOOL PHYSICS COURSE IS CONDUCTED MERELY EMPHASIZING MATTERS OF ASTRONOMICAL IMPORTANCE AND HAVING TO DO WITH MAKING RATIONAL TO THE STUDENT THOSE LAWS OF MOST CON CERN TO THE TERRESTRIAL INHABITANT A THIRD COURSE OF EQUAL LENGTH WOULD CONSIST LARGELY IN THE DEVISING OF SIMPLE APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE POSITIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES FROM TIME TO TIME AND THE DISCUSSION AND STUDY OF OBSERVATIONS MADE WITH THESE APPARATUS ASTRONOMICAL PHE NOMENA WOULD HERE BE PENETRATED A LITTLE MORE DEEPLY AND ASTRONOMICAL LAW WOULD BE STUDIED ON A LARGER SCALE THIS COURSE WOULD FILL OUT A FULL YEARS WORK OF THOROUGHLY SCIENTIFIC STUDY FINALLY I WOULD HAVE THIS COURSE PUT INTO THE CURRICULUM AS OPTIONAL AGAINST THE PHYSICS OR THE CHEMISTRY OR THE PHYSI OGRAPHY I WOULD ALSO PLAN THE WORK OF THESE FOUR SCIENCES SO THAT A STUDENT COULD DIVIDE HIS SCIENCE TIME IF HE CHOSE BETWEEN THEM MAKING THE TRANSITION AT THE BEGINNING OF ANY TERM EACH OF THE FOUR COURSES WOULD COMPRISE ENOUGH OF WHAT IS FUNDAMENTAL AND COMMON TO ALL TO AVOID CUTTING OFF THE STUDENT WHO HAS TAKEN ONLY ONE OF THEM FROM TAKING UP ANOTHER IF HE CHOOSES AT A SOMEWHAT ADVANCED STAGE I DESIRE NOW TO INDICATE THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK OF WHICH THE THIRD TERM MENTIONED ABOVE SHOULD CONSIST AS WELL AS TO SHOW SUCH CRUDE APPARATUS FOR MEASUREMENT AS THE CLASS COULD AND IN DEFAULT OF BETTER SHOULD MAKE AND USE I USE OF THE HAND 2 SHADOWS AND FLAG POLES 3 USE OF STAKES FOR FINDING HORIZONTAL DISTANCES BETWEEN HILLTOPS 4 DRAWING BOARD AND TRIPOD OR JACOBS STAFF 38DEPARTMENTAL CONFERENCESASTRONOMY 5 VISUAL ANGLE OF GLOBE SET ON PERIMETER OF A LARGE ELLIPSE AND MEASURED FROM A FOCUS 6 STADIA AND TROMBONE STADIA 7 CROSS STAFF 8 ALTITUDE BOARDS 9 MERIDIAN STONE IO PLUMBLINE GNOMON 11 LATITUDE BOX 12 HOMEMADE TELESCOPE BEFORE CLOSING LET ME MENTION THAT A MOVEMENT TO IMPROVE THE TEACHING OF ASTRONOMY IN THE HIGH SCHOOL WOULD JUST NOW BE OPPORTUNE CORRELATION AND UNIFICATION OF THE METRICAL QUANTI TATIVE AND MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL ARE NOW BEING WIDELY AND EARNESTLY DISCUSSED AND THE BODY OF FIRST RATE OPINION FAVORABLE TO THEM AS IMPROVEMENTS IN HIGHSCHOOL TEACHING PRACTICE MUST NOTCANNOTBE IGNORED MUCH LONGER A STUDY OF THE PROFESSIONAL OUTPUT OF WHAT MAY WITH BOTH JUSTICE AND PROPRIETY BE CALLED THE PROFESSIONALLY PRODUCTIVE TEACHING FORCE OF THE EASTERN CENTRAL AND WESTERN STATES WILL CONVINCE ANYONE THAT BOTH THEORY AND PRACTICE ARE OVERWHELMINGLY IN FAVOR OF THE CLOSER UNIFICATION OF COGNATE LINES OF HIGHSCHOOL STUDY NOW MY POINT IS THAT ASTRONOMY WHICH SINCE THE DAYS WHEN IT SLOUGHED ASTROLOGY AND BECAME TRULY A SCIENCE AS WELL AS BEFORE IT WAS BURDENED WITH THIS OLD MAN OF THE SEA HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CLOSEST ALLY OF THE MATHEMATICAL SCIENCES IT WOULD INDEED BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THESE CLOSELY KINDRED SUBJECTS HAS HELPED THE OTHER MOST IN THE GRAND MARCH OF SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS THAT MARCH WHICH UNTIL VERY RECENTLY WAS SYNONYMOUS WITH THE ADVANCE OF ASTRONOMICAL AND MATHEMATICAL THOUGHT THE REASON FOR THIS LIES IN THE NATURE OF THINGS THE ESTABLISH ING OF EVERY ASTRONOMICAL TRUTH CALLS FOR MATHEMATICAL PROCESS AND METHOD THERE IS THEREFORE MORE TRUTH THAN POETRY IN THE STATEMENT THAT THESE TWO SUBJECTS HAVE EACH VIED WITH THE OTHER IN THE STRUGGLE TO BE MUTUALLY HELPFUL AND THAT WHATEVER HAS HELPED THE ONE HAS ALWAYS STIMULATED THE OTHER OF ALL SUBJECTS IN THE HIGHSCHOOL CURRICULUM ASTRONOMY FUR NISHES THE MOST NATURAL THE EASIEST AND THE MOST TRULY HELPFUL CORRELATIONS WITH MATHEMATICS IN FACT REAL SCIENTIFIC ASTRO 39THE SCHOOL REVIEW NOMICAL STUDY CANNOT PROCEED WITHOUT CORRELATING WITH MATHE MATICS AND ONLY A LITTLE LESS STRONGLY WITH PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY I WOULD ARGUE IF IT WERE NECESSARY THAT THE CORRELATIONS OF ASTRONOMY WITH PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY SHOULD BE MADE OF THE STRONGEST CHARACTER WHAT WE COMMONLY REFER TO AS THE NEW ASTRONOMY SHOULD FIND LARGE PLACE IN THE SECONDARY SCHOOL ITS QUALITATIVE AS WELL AS ITS QUANTITATIVE CHARACTER ADAPTS IT PECULIARLY TO HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS THIS SORT OF ASTRONOMY IS LITTLE ELSE THAN A CORRELATION OF PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY SO THAT WE ARE HERE AGAIN BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH WHAT SEEMS A PEDAGOGIC CONTRADICTION IN THE VERY MIDST OF A SCHOOL SITUATION IN WHICH INTERRELATION CORRELATION AND UNIFICATION OF SUBJECTS ARE THE CENTRALEVEN PIVOTALIDEAS ABOUT WHICH PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING SEEMS TURN ING WE BEHOLD ASTRONOMY THAT ONE OF ALL THE SCIENCES BEST ADAPTED TO TREATMENT UNDER THESE IDEAS IN DANGER OF BEING DROPPED ALMOST ALTOGETHER FROM THE SCIENCE COURSES OF THAT PAR TICULAR PART OF THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WHICH THESE CENTRAL NOTIONS OF MODERN PEDAGOGICS ARE SUPPOSED TO BENEFIT MOST AGAIN IT SEEMS CLEAR THAT THE TROUBLE CANNOT BE WITH THE SUBJECTMATTER BUT RATHER WITH THE MODE OF TEACHING IT AGAIN I ASK CAN WE WHO BY OUR PRESENCE HERE DEMONSTRATE OUR INTEREST IN THE EDUCA TIONAL ASPECT OF SUCH SUBJECTMATTER AS ASTRONOMY STANDS FOR AFFORD TO STAND BY WITH APPARENT INDIFFERENCE AND ALLOW THE MOST TRULY SCIENTIFIC OF ALL THE SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS TO PERISH FROM LACK OF OUR WILLINGNESS OR READINESS TO RENDER ASSISTANCE IN THE PROB LEM OF FINDING ITS TRUE PLACE AND RELATION IN THE UPTODATE HIGH SCHOOL CURRICULUM I FOR ONE ANSWER WITH AN EMPHATIC NO THE SECOND PAPER WAS BY ASSISTANT PROFESSOR KURT LAVES ON THE USE OF THE GLOBE IN THE TEACHING OF ELEMENTARY AS TRONOMY 40

is about one thou sand feet above the present water surface and the evidence of waveaction along this ancient shore is abundant The history of Lake Bonneville as recorded on the stony pages of its precipitous shores and in the hardened sediments of its floor is more complicated than a mere recital of the shrinking and falling of waters through evaporation and other wasting causes For most of our knowledge upon this subject we are indebted to the detailed observation and study conducted by the United States Government Survey corps and especially to the investigations carried on under the direction of Major J W Powell Referring to the labors of Mr C I Gilbert and his associates in the lake region Director Powell thus briefly summarizes the history of Lake 130nnPville  First the waters were low occupying as Great Salt Lake now does onl a limited portion of the bottom of the basin Then they gradually rose and spread forming an inland sea nearly equal to Lake Huron in extentwith a maximum depth of one thousand feet Then the waters fell and the lake not merely dwindled in size but absolutely disappeared leaving a plain even more desolate than the Great Salt Lake Desert of today Then they again rose surpassing even their former height and eventually overflowing the basin at its northern edge sending a tributary stream to the Columbia River and last there was a second recession and the waters shrunk away until now only Great Salt Lake and two smaller lakes remain As is clearly understood the oscillations of the water in a lake possessing no outlet will be far more marked than in an opposite case In a body of water with an outflow a tolerably uniform level will be maintained the irregularities in the supply being com pensated for the most part by the varying volume of water flowing away but the level of a lake completely enclosed will be due ta the relation existing between the supply of water and the rate of evaporation The topography of the ancient shoreline of the Great Salt Lake shows that since the time of the  second reces sion of the waters referred to ky Major Powell in the quotation made above the lake has been unable to find an outlet for its con tents and has consequently reached its present diminutive propor tions through loss by evaporation alone The composition of the water would necessarily vary with the concentration The analysis most commonly accepted and which forms indeed the basis for current quotations and references is that made by Dr Gale and published in Stansburys report Gale found the water to possess a speciSc gravity of II70 and to contain 22282 per cent by weight of solid matter as follows sodium chloride Na C1 20I96 per cent sodium sulphate Na2 S04 I834 magnesium chloride Mg C12 0252 calcium chloride Ca C12 a trace These figures are used as indicative of the present composition in several of the most recent cyclopedias such as are used for general reference and even the revised school textbooks in geog raphy quote as above It should be remembered in accepLing such results however that the investigation upon which they are based was made on water collected forty years ago and it is scarcely to be expected that such would represent the composition of the water at the present time For a number of years preceding I883 the lake had been steadily rising This rise was entirely in dependent of the annual oscillations to which the waters of the lake seem subject under all circumstances In referring to this fact Mr Gilbert writes as follows see Lands of the Arid Regions p 66  Thus it appears that in recent times the lake has overstepped a bound to which it had long been subject Previous to the year I865 and for a period of indefinite duration it rose and fell with the limited oscillation and with the annual tide but was never car ried beyond a certain limiting line In that year or the one fol lowing it passed the line and it has not yet returned Theannual tide and the limited oscillations are continued as before but the lowest stage of the new rdgsge is higherethan the highest stage of the old The mean stage of the new regsme is seven or eight feet higher than the mean stage of the old The mean area of the water surface is a sixth part greater under the new regsme than under the old The last statement is based on the United States surveys of Capt Stansbury and Mr King The former gathered 444 its properties however long it was thus kept There is no static condition in heat phenomena exchange is constant These facts indicate that light or radiant energy is no more an electro magnetic phenomenon than magnetism is a thermal phenomenon but that it is one of a distinct orde That point is inmaterial here for what I wish to call attention to is the fact that a heated body sets up in the ether such a physical condition that its reaction upon another body brings the latter to a condition similar to the first that is it heats it I V Thze Acovssc Fieg There is another physical field with which all are acquainted though it has not hitherto been called by that name I refer to the phenomena of sound Suppose a bell be struck sound1vaves in air are formed that travel outwards and have the same geometrical space relations that other fields have So long as the medium is uniform the field is uniform and the energy of the soundwaves per unit surface and unit time varies inversely as the square of the distance from the source When such soundwaves fall upon other masses of matter they are absorbed and reflected Those that are absorbed set the body in vibratoy motion similar to the original vibrating body that is to say they produce sound If such second body upon which the waves fall happens to have its own vibratory rate in accordance with the timerate of the incident waves the effect is cumulative and the body may be made to visi bly as well as audibly vibrate If not the vibrations are said to be forced vibrations but in every case every body in an acoustic field ls made to vibrate Now there is the same distinction between the vibratory motions of the bell and the airwaves that result from them as there is between heated molecules and the undulations in Xthe ether but acoustical terminology has not hitherto been so se riously incommoded hy the failure to make the distinction as has been the case with heat phenomena As sound phenomena are treated as special cases in kinetics the space within which sound waves are produced by the vibratory motions of a body may be spoken of as the acoustic field and here as in the other three cases we have the fact that a sounding body sets up in the medi um about it such a physical condition as by its reaction upon an sther body brings the latter into a vibratory state like the first These various physical relations may be thus generalized when a mass of matter acts upon the medium that is about it the latter is thrown into such a physical conditition or state that its reaction upon another body always induces in the second body a state simi lar to that of the first body This has a much wider application than most physical laws for it embraces phenomena in mechanics heat light electricity and magnetism A E DOLBEAR Tufts College Dec 2I The Waters of the Great Salt Lake LONG before white men first trod the shores of the Great Salt Lake strange ctories of this inland sea had found their way onto the civilized regions of our own land and even beyond the ocean Tne earliest record of the lake was made in I689 by the traveller Le Hontan who relied for his information upon the wild tales told by the Indian tribes of the Mississippi valley In I843 however the lake was visited its shores explored and its waters navigated by Gen Fremont of extensive fame Six years later I8gso a fuller survey was made under the personal direction of sCapt Howard Stansbury USA whose report Expedition to the Valley of the Great Salt Lake issued at Washington in I853 The Great Salt Lake is by far the largest body of water existing in the Great Basin Its average length is seventyfive miles and its width forty miles The altitude of the lake is near forty two hundred feet above sealevel and the region is declared by geologists to be still rising Even a hasty examination of the Salt Lake valley will convince the observer that the present lake is but the shrunken remnant of a vastly larger body of water which at one time stretched far be yond the limits of the valley This former sea was a feature of quaternary times and has been named Lake Bonneville It ex tended beyond the Idaho line on the north invaded Nevada on the west and closely approached the Arizona boundary on the south Of this great body Utah Lake and Sevier Lake now existing as listinct occurrences in the regions south were but comparatively Grams Per Cent Sy per Litre Weight I52  4983 I3  5856 J5 s 9540 I  42I3 I2 6776 I  I295 I  6679 o  I 47 7 4 v 853 o  432I I87  648I I6  7I62

per cent solid matter though it is a closer approach than usual to the earliest figures and the ones most widely published is hardly to be considered typical since the sea son of I889 was one of unusual drought Two or three consecu tive winters with heavy snows would dilute the water to its con dition of a few years ago In the opinion of the writer it would be more correct to quote the average contents of the Salt Lake water at sixteen per cent solid matters than at twentytwo per cent as is most frequently done Our subject presents an economical aspect which is well worthy of attentive consideration The composition of the water is sucl as to suggest theeasy manufacture of a number of chemical sub stances therefrom Branches of such an enterprise haste already been instituted and the results achieved have kindled the brightest hopes of increasing success   The preparation of common salt from the water would be natu rally the first undertaking of the kind to suggest itself and this process has been in successful operation on an industrial scale for a number of years There are now half a dozen establishments for saltmanufacture on the lake shore At several of these places however the preparations for saltmaking consist simplv in con structing a nurnber of evaporatingponds below the level of the lake and separated from the latter by dikes of such a height that during periods of rough water the waves beat over the embank ments and fill the ponds with brine The evaporation of the water thus enclosed goes on without any artificial aid and a bountiful harvest of salt in the season thereof is the result In such cases the evaporation is carried to completion All the solid constituents of the brine remain in the salt there being no attempt made to get rid of the motherliquors after the deposit of crystals tAt other ofthe works however r3otably at the Inland Salt Com panys Gardens a different plan is pursued This establishment is the largest saltworks in the West and is situated near Garfield Beach the most popular pleasureresort on the lake The method employed by this company differs from those already described in that the water is pumped from the lake into ponds prepared for its reception and situated above the level of the lake surface Tlle motherliquors flow off are returned to the lake in fact when the evaporation has reached the proper stage From the establish ment of the worlis until I883 the lake was close to the ponds but owing to the unusually high rate of evaporation attending the dry seasons of the irnmediate past the water has receded so that at present it has to be conveyed over 2500 feet to the earaporating re ceptacles This is effected by the aid of two centrifugal pumps raising together I4000 gallons of water per minute The pumps throw the water to a height of fourteen feet into a flume through which it flows to the ponds These are nine in number and are arranged in series In the first pond the mechanically suspended matters are left as sediment or scum and the water passes into the second in a clear condition The ponds cover upwards of a thou sand acres and the drain channels leading from them aggregate nine miles in length The pumping continues through May June and July A fair idea of the rate of evaporation in the thirsty atmosphere of the Great Basin may be gained from contemplating the fact that to supply the volume of water disappearing from the ponds by evaporation requires the action of the pumps ten laours Sdaily in June and July This is equal to the carrying away of 8400000 gallons per day from the surface of the ponds The salt harvest  begins in August soon after the cessation of pumping and continues till all is gathered frequently extending into the spring months of the succeeding year An average season yields a layer of salt sevenvinches deep which amount would be deposited from fortynine inches of lakewater The density at which salt begins to deposit as observed at the ponds and con firmed by laboratory experiments is I2I2I and that of the escap ing motherliquors is I2345 The yield o salt is at the rate of I50 tons per inch depth per acre The crop is gathered on horsecars which run on movable tracks into the ponds At the works the operations are simple and effective A linkbelt conveyor carries the coarse salt to the crusher thence to the dryer after which a sifting process is employed by which the salt is separated into table salt and dairy salt It will be seen from the foregoing that the preparation of salt SCIE the material for his map in I850 when the water was at its lowest stage and the latter in the spring of I869 when the water was near its highest stage The one map shows an area of I750 and the other of 2I66 square miles From these I estimate tlle old mean area at I820 miles and the new at 2I25 miles and the in crease at 305 miles or I7 per cent The probable cause of this increased watersupply in the Great Basin would form a most interesting and instructive subject of inquiry but such would be foreign to the purposes of the present paper and here it must suffice to say that two theories have beer advanced as offering most probable explanations of the phenome non viz the climatic theory and the theory of human agencies In the report already referred to Lands of the Arid Regions the author says  On the whole it may be wise to hold tlle ques tion an open one whether the watersupply has been increased by a climatic change or by human agency So far as we now know neither theory is inconsistent with the facts and it is possible that the truth includes both During this recent epoch of increasing volume the lakewater would be naturally expected to show a far lower percentage of solid contents In  Contributions to the History of Lake Bonne ville published in the  Report of the tJnited States Geological Survey I8808I Gilbert places the total salinity of the water at fifteen per centa striking variation from the figures of Dr Gale yet a variation not at all too great to be fully explained by the in creased volume of the lake and the consequent decrease in con centration An investigation of the water by Allen in I869 see Kings report showed the total solid matter to be I49934 per cent The present writer made an analysis on water taken from the lake in December I885 with the following results This water had a speeifie gravity of II225 Another sample of lakewater taken in February I888 showed a density of II26I A further test was made in June I889 the water being II48 in density and in August 1889 the water was I1569 The figures resulting from the latest determinations shovv a eonsiderable in erease in the proportion of solids and this is fully explained by the sueeession of exeessively dry seasons to which the Great Basin has been subjected sinee I883 eausing a remarkable shrinking of the lake volume In August I889 the lake was lower than at any time sinee the tinauguration of Gilberts new regzme A sample of water was taken from the lake during that month and analyzed with these results The water possessed a speeifie gravity of II569 and eontained Per Cent

of the operation is effected wholly through natural agencies The simplicity of the process and the 4Lavish yield enable the manufacturers to put their commodity on the market at an incredibly low price The Inland Salt Company sells dry coarse salt for the Eastern trade packed on cars at the YYworks at one dollar per ton Thg quaity ox the lakesalt is of the highest grade Several cspecimens of the commercial article as manufactured and sold by the various companies have been analyzed by the writer and of tthese the following are typical  According to published figures commercial bay salt from other l sources seldom exceeds 96 per cent sodium chloride Next to common salt in the order of abundance and ease of prep aration sodium sulphate should be named This is deposited in the crystallized form as mirabilite Na S04  IO H2  during the winter season When the temperature falls to a certain point the lakewater assumes an opalescent appearance from the separation of the sulphate This sinks as a crystalline precipitate and much ls carried by the waves upon the beach and there deposited Under Sfavorable circuznstances the shores become covered to a depth of several feet with crystallized mirabilite The writer has on several sccasions waded through such deposits sinking at every step to lthe knees Speaking only of the amounts thrown upon the shores and of most ready access the source is practically inexhaustible The substance must be gathered if at all soon after the deposit Srst appears as if the water once rises above the critical tempera ture the whole deposit is taken again into solution This change s very rapid a single day being oftentimes sufficient to effect the  entire disappearance of all the deposit within reach of the waves Warned by these circumstances the collectors heap the substance on the shores above the lap of the waters in which situation it is comparatively secure until needed To a slight depth the mirabi lite emoresces but within the piles the hydrous crystalline condi tion is maintained At the present time there are thousands of tons of this material heaped in the manner described remaining rom the collections of preceding winters The sodium sulphate  thus iavishly supplied is of a fair degree of purity as will be seen  from the following analyses of two samples of the crystallized sub stance taken from opposite shores of the lake 446 SCIENCE VOL XIV No o60 I form by the lake the price being simply the labor of collecting r there are many other compounds that may be had for the asking  The unlimited quantities of sodium sulphate spread upon the shore  every winter forcibly suggest the sodiumcarbonate industry as 4 r promising undertaking the chemical labor for preparing the car bonate by the Le Blanc process being in fact already half done A few years ago an establishment was founded for this purpose in I Salt Lake City and though the labor thus far accomplished has r been mostly experimental in its nature the results conclusively f prove that sodium carbonate and a number of other chemical com pounds may be derived from the lakewater with ease and profit When once such manufacture is undertaken on a proper scale the output of soda need be limited only by the capacity of the works Caustic soda and sodium hyposulphite have also been prepared from the lake The importance of the Great Salt Lake as a source of chemical supplies is still unrealized Figures would have but little meaning if used in an attempt to express the chemical wealth diffused through its briny waters Even for the unscientific observer and the casual visitor the characteristic phenomena of the lake possess a fascinating interest Many persons who would be but slightly moved by the statement that the waters of the lake vary in density between II2 and II7 would be deeply impressed to learn that a bather can float at ease in the water with a large proportion of the body above the surface When once accustomed to the lake the swimmer can lie in the watery cradle with his head resting on a pillow of wood as se curely as in a suspended hammock The chief difficulty in swim ming is the tendency of the lower limbs to rise above the water  and the principal danger lies in the occasional entrance of brine t into mouth or nostrils producing a painful irritation followed by suffocation The concentrated state of the brine insures the lake against the L fetters of frost Ice is not to be seen upon its bosom even during r the severest winters The temperature falls at times to 20 F yet thelake remains as freely open as during the warmer seasons  The antiseptic properties of the water have been known from the I time of its earliest investigation Capt Stansbury reported a test which has been repeatedly verified since his time His description  was as follows    Before leaving Black Rock we made an experiment upon the t properties of the lake for preserving meat A large piece of fresh  beef was suspended by a cord and immersed in the lake rather more than twelve hours when it was found to be tolerably well corned After this all the beefwe wished to preselve while oper  ating upon the lake was packed into barrels without any salt what ever and the vessels were then filled up with the lakewater No i further care or preparation was necessary and the meat kept  sweet although constantly exposed to the sun I have no doubt that meat put up in this water would remain sound and good as 5 long as if prepared by the most improved rnethods Indeed we were obliged to mix fresh water with this natural brine to prevent our meat from becoming too salt for present use a very few days t immersion changing its character from corned beef to what the  sailors call s salt junk As would be expected of so concentrated a brine and as has been proved by observation life in the waters of the Great Salt Lake is confined to few species Some writers have declared that no form of animal or plant life exists in the lake but this is an error with but little excuse for its perpetration The tiny crusta cean 24rSe1tia ferSZzs exists in very great numbers often tinting the water over wide areas with its own delicate pink There is also EpAydragrarzEzs in its early stages The pupa cases of this insect are often carried ashore in large masses where they under go decomposition with characteristic odorous emanations One form of Corzza has also been found No fish or other large form  of animal life however has been diiscovered in the waters The vegetable organisms of the lake the presence of which may be considered a fact from the abundance of animal existences are  almost entirely unstudied The life of the Great Salt Lake is a subject awaiting further investigation than

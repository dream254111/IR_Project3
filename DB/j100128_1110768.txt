tendency in New York to except cases of the nature of the one under discussion having negli gence as the gravamen of the action22 from the rule governing actions for direct injuries to land23 is a salutary one the distinction is hardly warranted by the cases even in New York24 for here too the determination of title may be necessitated25 Since however there is no essential lack of jurisdiction in the courts with respect to such actions it would seem preferable where as in this case the proper interest appears in the plaintiff for the New York Courts to take cognizance of actions for injuries to real property lying beyond its borders rather than to unnecessarily force a resident to pursue the wrongdoer beyond the jurisdiction2 THE UNAUTHORIZED ISSUE OF CORPORATE STOCThe rights and liabilities arising from an overissue of corporate stock are primarily determinable from a consideration of the nature of a corporation The conception that a corporation is a being of such limited powers that any attempt to transgress the boundaries set by its charter is necessarily a nullity and the more generally accepted doctrine that as the corporation is a creature of law any exercise of power in excess of the statutory authorization is impliedly prohibited and conse quently illegal are both products of the period when the privilege of assuming corporate powers was a special franchise Although these theories are logically defensible their application demonstrates that their failure to give proper recognition to the correlation of interests of State stockholders and creditors often causes manifest injustice As neither the State2 nor the stockholders3 unaided by the other can bring a corporation into being4 the powers of an entity organized through the concurrence of both are not

contracts incident to the common enterprise0 and in addition to the powers conferred on the company by the agree ment of the stockholders7 grants the right to be recognized as an entity8 Justice would therefore seem to demand that every act of the officers of the corporation in its behalf should be considered law ful unless rendered illegal by express prohibition0 An unauthorized act would however be subject to attack by a stockholder as a breach of the original agreement0 but unless set aside or enjoined as a consequence of such attack would be binding upon both the corporation and the third party Thus an overissue of stock if consented to by all the stockholders would be valid although the corporation would be liable to a forfeiture of its charter were the increase of the capital deemed harmful to the public interest12 The purchasers would become stockholders in the corporation with the same rights and privileges and subject to the same obligations and liabilities as the original subscribers and a creditor who dealt with the corporation in reliance upon a capital apparently adequate would find a real instead of a fictitious fund from which he might obtain satisfaction of his claim While the view that an unauthorized act is valid except in so far as it injuriously affects the interest of a dissenting stockholder has been accorded some judicial recognition in connection with many acts conceived to be beyond the power of a corporation13 it has never been accepted where the issue of unauthorized capital was involved14 Wherever this question has arisen the courts have assumed rather than decided that an increase of capital was beyond the power of the corporation and that the stock was void whether See Memphis Branch Ry Co v Sullivan I876 57 Ga 24o Hartford  N H R R

fraufdulently by an agent5 or bona fide at the command of all the stockholders8 As a fixed and unalferable capital is not inherently essential to an entity7 an increase of capital would seem on principle to be merely an unauthorized act and would be void only in a jurisdic tion in which every unauthorized act is considered a noncorporate actl8 A recognition of the validity of an overissue would however logically be required in a jurisdiction in which a socalled ultra vires contract is enforceable when it has been so far executed by either party as to confer a benefit on the otherl9 Assuming the stock to be void it nevertheless does not follow that a purchaser has no remedy The corporation being an inanimate entity can act only through an agent20 and is responsible for the acts of its agent in any case in which a natural person occupying a similar position would be liable as a principal2 Recovery could therefore be enforced against the corporation whenever the purchaser has paid the consideration for the stock to an agent acting within his apparent authority22 In any case the principal may be compelled to reimburse the purchaser to the extent of the benefit actually received23 A problem requiring the application of these principles was recently presented to the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court in the case of Higginbotham v International Trust Co 1910 126 N Y Supp 366 The defendant trust company was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York requiring the full amount of the capital stock to be subscribed and paid in before the company was authorized to commence business The stock being fully sub scribed but not wholly paid in the defendants president one MaxweIl procured a transfer of 145000 to the defendants credit by charging that amount to the account of a depositor in a bank of which Maxwell was an officer and thereupon filed the required affidavit with the Secretary of State The plaintiff subsequently made a payment to Maxwell on an oversubscription for twentyfive shares of stock and was given a receipt therefor signed by Maxwell as president of the defendant trust company This money was paid by Maxwell into the account of the depositor in the bank The plaintiff having brought an action against the trust company for money had and received to Allen v South Boston Ry Co I889 I50 Mass 200 Titus v

reached the conclusion two justices dissenting that as the defendant received the benefit of the plaintiffs payment it was under a duty to refund the amount paid As the basis of the recovery was the unjust enrichment of the defend ant at the expense of the plaintiff24 it would seem from the facts that the benefit was too remote and the opinion of the dissenting justices is therefore preferable BURDEN OF PROVING SURVIVORSHIP N A COMMON DISASTERWhile the fact that one of several persons overtaken by a common disaster was the last to perish may of course be established by ordinary proofl the difficulty is that from the very nature of such accidents there is almost invariably an entire absence of evidence The common law deeming the relative order of death as unascertainable in law as it is in fact has declined both to adopt the civil law presumptions of survivorship based upon age or sex and to presume that death was simultaneous2 In view of this any claimant who must establish the fact of survivorship as a condition precedent to his right to recover the property will be unable to do so and only that party can succeed whose right is not dependent upon such a condition3 Because the practical result is in nearly every case that the property is disposed of as though the deaths had occurred at the same instant it seems to have been thought that the rule which requires a party asserting predecease or survival to prove it necessarily has the same effect as a presumption of synchronous death4 Yet it is erroneous to suppose that such a presumption and an entire absence of presumption are convertible expressions If for example the nonsurvival of one of the persons who have perished is a condition precedent to the right of a legatee the latter can recover the property if he can show either predecease or coinstantaneous death Were the courts to presume death at the same moment the legatee would have a prima facie right to the property which his opponent could not rebut Since however there is no presumption to aid the legatee he will be unable to show the happening of either of the conditions upon which his claim depends and must consequently fail6 2Lockwood v Kelsea

critical study of socialist systems of exchange M Aucuy undertakes to show that socialism of exchange is impossible without socialism of pro duction and with this in view examines in both their theoretical and their practical aspects the systems of Owen and Proudhon the less known ideas of Vidal and Haeck and the comptabilisme social of the Belgian Salvoy The main interest of the book for most readers lies in the careful exposition of the ideas of the last three writers for the thesis of the work is of course not new dating back to Karl Marx It is none the less worth while to examine the theories of these socialists in spite of themselves as Pro fessor Deschamps calls them in the introduction to the book in order to point out the fallacy of thinking that economic injustice can be done away with by merely tinkering the system of exchange without changing pro duction Men have always tried to find the source of their economic troubles in the working of the money system instead of tracing the in justices of our present distribution to their roots in the system of production M Aucuys bookis a justified protest against this sort of thinking Barnard J Lynn Factory Legislation in Pennsylvania Its History and Administration Pp xi 178 Price 150 Philadelphia University of Pennsylvania 1907 John C Winston Co Selling Agents Under this title the author has given a much needed and scholarly account of this field of social progress in Pennsylvania The subject matter is divided almost evenly into the two fields of History and Administration Under the former the movement for the legal regulation of women and child labor is carefully reviewed from the days of 1824 until the present date Allied move ments such as sweatshop fireescape and bakeshop legislation are duly treated Particular emphasis is thrown on the gravity of the childlabor sit uation in Pennsylvania and the work of certain publicspirited organizations and citizens since 1904 in attempting to ameliorate these conditions Under the subject of Administration the author shows an inside knowledge of the conditions which make easy the violation of the factory law Here again he shows how far short of even an imperfect standard we have fallen in regard to caring for our future citizensthe children Dr 263264 The Annals of the American Academy Barnard from his actual experience in childlabor legislation and from his valuable experience as a teacher is in a position to point out a way to higher things Books such as this covering all the large industrial states would soon remove the criticism one sometimes

writings of Gerrard Winstanley Starting from a standpoint strictly religious Winstanley worked out the theory of his digger movement He says In the beginning of time the great Creator Reason made the earth to be a common treasury to preserve beasts birds fishes and man the Lord who was to govern this creation Therefore he argues the earth belongs equally to all When equal freedom of the land is denied to some this is a sign that the people are not really free but only seemingly so Winstanleys whole doctrine is summed up in these wordsTrue Com monwealths Freedom lies in the free enjoyment of the earth He wrote prirtcipally during the administration of Oliver Cromwell His movement was hindered by the government officials and the officers of the troops stationed in his neighborhood As with all reform movements the people for whose benefit the movement was made were the loudest in their out cries and ridicule After working for a long time in the face of this oppo sition at the digging of the commons and writing appeals to the nation Winstanley was finally forced to desist In his work we have perhaps the first definite statement of the thought that the returns from natural re sources are given to all and should be enjoyed equally by all This is the doctrine which worked out along a wholly different line by Henry George brings him to his single tax theory Bierly W R Police Power

It is the professed purpose of the writer to present a detailed accountBook Department 265 of this affair with a view to showing definitely the circumstances and motives ot the actors The diplomatic papers of the state department and the Monroe papers in the library of congress are found to shed new light on the inner history of this diplomatic game The study clearly brings out the interesting fact that it was part of the game of the government to appoint Monroe as envoy to France France was suspicious of the real purpose of Jays mission to Great Britian Monroe an AntiFederal and a strong French sympathizer was sent to allay this suspicion Due blame is accorded the American government for withholding from Monroe the full extent of Jays powers and so using him as a means of practicing this deception on the French government On the other hand Monroes weak ness in posing as the representative of the American people instead of the government of betraying too openly his feelings for France and of publicly criticizing the government all receive due censure Belated praise is accorded Monroe for the creditable part he played in keeping France at peace at a critical period in protecting American interests abroad and in helping to secure the treaties with Algiers and Spain Alto gether it is an interesting bit of history and the author has succeeded in shedding new light upon this episode Boyd Carl Evans Cases on Constitutional Law Second edition Pp xi 827 Price 3oo Chicago Callaghan  Co 1907 This collection of cases originally published in 1898 has been of increas ing popularity for use in connection with courses on constitutional law It is a compendious summary of the chief decisions on constitutional law in somewhat over eight hundred pages No selection can suit exactly the requirements of all students but Mr Boyd has made an excellent choice of cases which the average man will find well adapted to his wants The text is printed literally with the omission only of the arguments and statements of fact which are unnecessary for the illustration of the point of law involved The notes are few as the author has preferred to use the space they would have taken for additional decisions The present edition contains a supplement giving the chief decisions from 1898 to the spring of 1904 The type and paper are good and a substantial buckram binding

1907 The book is the substance of a series of lectures delivered by the author before the students of the Boston University School of Theology The object is to discuss the trend of events and the author being a missionary devoted somewhat over half the volume to the trend of things religious For the average reader therefore the first half of the book holds the chief inter est the later chapters are hardly likely to appeal to anyone but the enthusi astic mission worker266 The Annals of the American Academy In the chapter on the Greatness of China is given a very clear and not seriously exaggerated summary of the tremendous resources of the empire and a brief description of the highlydeveloped system of agriculture It is certainly a most glowing future which the authors enthusiasm leads him to paint The Chinese are to people the vast wilderness of Borneo they are to be the dominant race of the eastern tropics through intermarriage with the natives they are to be the intellectual nation of the Orient and they will largely control Oriental commerce before the middle of this cen tury All of these conclusions are derived by the author from an analysis of Chinese character and things Chinese It is often difficult however to follow some of the leaps in his logic From the political standpoint Mr Brewster regards China as a great people but an imbecile state commercially sound but politically rotten This condition he ascribes to the presence of the Manchu rulers a non Chinese dynasty on the throne and the universal evil of political graft which from examples cited must even surpass that of our own more en lightened western civilization The remedy for the first of these evils will be found in the impending constitutional government and for the latter in the spread of Christianity by which loyalty to the state will be made to replace the present attitude of ancestor worship and selfish interests The low industrial condition is not to be attributed to overpopulation unproductive soil laziness or intellectual incapacity but to the fact that the brain and the brawn are not united In support of this argu ment the author draws very vivid pictures of the primitive methods en countered in every field of labor He believes firmly in the solution by industrial education but weakens his argument by assuming that the edu cation is to come from missionaries Unfortunately the average missionary knows all too little about farming implements and machine shops Mr Brewsters enthusiasm for his work appears to have obscured his recognition of the fact that trade and commerce and general world intercourse are the factors which have lifted nations in the past and must be expected to do the major part of the work in the future The main theme of the book appears to be that missions and the spread of Christianity will prove the solution of all difficulties and make China the foremost nation of the East But the experience in Japan and recent progress there are not easily reconciled to this view Brisco Norris A The Economic Policy of Robert Walpole Pp 217 Price I5o New York Macmillan Company 1907 Thorough study has been accorded to the large part played by Robert Walpole in the constitutional history of his period and to his political and foreign policy scant and only incidental treatment to Walpole the financier and economist It is an era of great questions in politics and foreign policies It is likewise an era of important financial and economic questions As the author says There has hitherto been no systematic treatment of the economic policy of Robert Walpole and it was felt here was a field for study This comprehensive and orderly treatment is a welcome addition to theBook Department 267 library of the student of economics But it has also a great value to the student of political history for historians are realizing to a greater degree the modifying influence of economic affairs on the course of political events To his fiscal policy one chapter is devoted An account is given of Walpoles sound financial judgment amidst the disorders attendant upon the bursting of the speculative bubble as likewise of his keen foresight in restoring confidence in the government by instituting a sinking fund to guarantee payment of the national debt Walpole was a firm advocate of the merchantilistic policy of trade A discussion of his endeavors to put this policy into practice by reforms in the taxes and customs duties covers two chapters His excise plan and his efforts to repeal the duties on imports met great opposition and in general failed of realization and shows that Wal pole as a reformer was simply in advance of his time The student of colonial history will find an interesting and able chapter on Walpoles colonial policy and his system of bounties To his work of developing home industry and building up a foreign trade two chapters are allotted The monograph is well and clearly written Browne H

Massachusetts from 1780 to 1905 Pp 144 Price Ioo New York American Economic Association 1907 This historical sketch of the finances of Massachusetts as a commonwealth for a century and a quarter is purely one of general questions of finance without regard to details of legislation or administration The author has been content to describe policies estimate critically their results and allow the narrative to point its own moral if moral it has The financial history of the state is divided into six periods to each of which is devoted a chapter The first period from 17801794 is one concerned with the efforts towards the rehabilitation of disordered finances the heritage of Revolutionary days The next period 17941825 witnesses the extinction of the debt and times of financial prosperity The period from 1825 to i86o is probably one of the most dramatic interest in the annals of state finances In the history of Massachusetts it is an era of internal improvements and of general prosperity attendant upon the specu lative movement which had its climax in the panic of 1837 and it sees the gradually widening gap between expenditures and revenues and the unsuccessful efforts to avoid a state tax The history of state finances of this period has been neglected and there is need of a comprehensive and orderly treat ment of the disordered finances of the states with the question of financing internal improvements issues of bonds repudiation of bonds and assumption of these debts by the federal government The Civil War period is one of onerous financial burdens caused by war loans with the necessity of finding new sources of income The period after the war down to i88o concerns itself with the difficulties of financing268 The Annals of the American Academy railroad enterprises of the crisis of 1873 and the consequent retrenchment in all the departments of the government The last quarter of a century is one of steady increase in state expenditures and growth of a new state debt The appendix contains tables of statistics of state tax from 1789 to 1905 and the ordinary revenues and expenditures for the period of 1816 to i86o There is also a bibliography Works dealing with figures and finances are apt to be dry and dull but it is a pleasure to find in this monograph an account very clear comprehensive and readable Bureau of American Ethnology Twentyfourth

city is possessed by a certain unreality which adds greatly to its charm It is not forbidding as is Toledo nor has it the air of desertion present in so many of the old Spanish cities but it is a

Selection in Sociology Pp xxx 571 Price 450 New York The Macmillan Co 19o07 It will suffice to say that training in sociology must be preceded by training in biology and that none of the great problems of sociology can be under stood much less solved unless the sociologist possesses sufficient training in biology and sufficient knowledge of the facts concerning heredity and selection The book begins therefore with a long and really good dis cussion of heredity Our criticism upon these first one hundred and sixty pages is that the author has allowed himself to be drawn too much into the discussion of moot points which should be left to the biologist and that he has clung too closely to the ideas of Weismann and seemingly underrated the work of De Vries It is almost needless to add that the theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics is rejected The chief criticism of the rest of the volume is its lack of plan or continuity and the wholly eclectic method of treatment Some chapters seem to be reprints of articles elsewhere used while within a given chapter very divergent topics are considered Over one hundred pages are devoted to Part IISocial Pathology which includes six chaptersSuicide Insanity and Syphilis as Social Factors Social Selection and Inverse Selection Con flict and Progress Concluding Remarks Occasionally there is very careless use of language or else the author forgets his biology as when he writes of hereditary syphilis In Part III he discusses The Biological and Traditional Factors of Race Progress The Bankruptcy of Liberalism Socialism and Science Religion as a Social Force At times he seems to think that society is going to decay Neither liberalism socialism science nor Christianity will be effective in promoting social development Although Christianity as now understood will fail yet some religious system will develop Although Mr Hill disputes Mr Benjamin Kidds arguments he nevertheless agrees in the necessity of a suprarational ideal for the individual and society For the general idea of the author there is much to be said His present exposition is not satisfactory and should not be final Many of the crit icisms and suggestions he makes are very valuable and deserve attention Instead of seeking to extirpate diseased living generations in the inter ests of the race which is to come after us every resource of applied science270 The Annals of the American Academy is devoted to prolonging the life of weak and biologically useless persons thus permitting their reproduction or again So far then as

view of the writer constantly Argentine is a land of the future the best point for emigration in the twentieth century as the United States was in the nineteenth Toward this land of promise German emigration should be consciously turned The prosperous condition of the German colonists settled in the country is a matter of justifiable pride but one is surprised to hear in spite of the common belief in the preponderance of English capital and enterprise in this part of the world that Imports and Exports    are chiefly in the hands of Germans The greatest German colony of the future at least in an ethnic sense should be in Argentina Though this national caste pervades many of the pages the author gives interesting sketches of political social industrial and military developments which are of real value as sources of facts The observations on presentday conditions are keen and apparently critical though often the author allows himself to be lead for a page or two into the role of the prophet rather than that of the interpretera privilege which should be granted to an author who avowedly writes of a land of the future In justice it must be said however that as a rule the author walks with his feet upon the ground The Argentine is to be the leader of South America With the crea tion of a strong spirit of nationality and an army so strong as to impose peace on enemies

book is a collection of historic facts tied together loosely and at times having little apparent connection In that the work is dis appointing for one naturally expects a development to show an un broken line of growth and advance The work represents an enormous amount of research but a woeful lack of classification and definite arrange ment272 The Annals of the American Academy The author takes up first ancient society and treats of the influence which Israel Egypt and Phoenicia Greece and Rome had on the later thought then passes on to the problems of Mediaval Society The Organ ization of Agriculture The Development of Commerce The Reformation and ends with a discussion of modern social movements There is a tendency in the early part of the book to explain every thing in terms of environmentparticularly geographical environment For example on page 24 is the statement that Greek characteristics were due in part to geographical conditions and in part to the social life which as shown above was largely determined by those conditions In other words geography acting directly and indirectly made Greek characteristics While the advocates of the theory of the influence of geography on human actions and thought carry their ideas to extremes they would scarcely make so farreaching a statement as this one In dealing with social and economic problems the author shows a singu lar lack of appreciation of the practical side of questions His statements are bookish and not careful or well considered The discussion of such problems as the Factory System the Industrial Revolution and the Rise of Socialism are disappointing Passing over the fact that the book makes difficult and rather uninter esting readingfor that is a fault common to a great mass of recent literature on social scienceone may at least expect on finishing a chapter or section of a chapter to have in mind some definite thought which the author has been trying to convey But this is not the case with The Devel opment of Western Civilization The book suffers from a fault which has become unpleasantly common among modern works of the character The author has assembled a Jarge number of facts and has then written a book containing these facts without making any great attempt to see that the facts formed a logical sequence or that a consecutive thought formed a center for the book In short the facts in the present work are undigested Facts should suggest ideas and ideas should lead to conclusions but the author has been satisfied with the facts Foulke W D Translated by History of

contained in the former seven editions of Mr Griffis book made up the present work Since 1882 when the first edition appeared this book has been the most widely read interpretation of the little known and less understood country which has just recently passed out of the list of nations into that of dependencies The authors intimacy with Oriental affairs through his former connection with the University of Tokio and his wide travel and long residence in eastern countries lends authority to his opinion It comes as a relief after the severe adverse criticism to which almost all writers have subjected the Koreans to hear that there lies within the people at large the possibility of a regeneration The author however does not blink the shortcomings of the government and states many facts which point to the justification of the alleged highhanded policy of Japan With the Japanese manage ment of the situation he is not altogether satisfied The Nipponese have been too careless in allowing the lower class the adventurers and sharpers to stream into the country before the government had been established upon a basis such that it could cope with the new responsibilities In its new form the book brings up to date a history filled with misfortunes and dis appointmentsthe story of a nation illfated both on account of its peculiar international situation and the almost unexampled inefficiency of its ruling class Griffis William Elliot The Japanese Nation in Evolution Pp xii 408 Price 125 New York Thomas Y Crowell 1907 The unchanging trait in a Japanese is to covet

the uncertainty of securing a living in our modern industrial system This is the question which the author attempts to answer in the four hundred pages of Three Acres and Liberty The book is really a brief for intensive farming Only a few pages are devoted to theory the greater number being taken up with very practical discussions of the kinds of crops that should be raised on certain lands the character of land which should be purchased or rented and the method of treating this purchased or rented land after it has been secured The author deals in a very comprehensive way with many of the be setting problems of the small farmer He gives instances of small farmers who have secured a living and paid off mortgages on two or three acres of land which others passed by as useless The average American farmer does not know what intensive farming means He thinks that he has done well if he gets 150 or 2oo bushels of potatoes from an acre He does not know that others have gotten 1284 bushels By intensive culture by care by scientific methods a man can raise on ten acres more and bet ter produce than is raised by the average farmer on fifty acres Of course the book deals with small farming near the city more than with extensive farming in remote districts one of the authors contentions being that a man moving out a few miles can enjoy all of the benefits of city life without incurring any of its discomforts The book is well worth the careful consideration of any farmer who is producing truck it is invaluable to any one who is contemplating smallscale farming near a large city and it presents a ray of hope to the man in the city who with a small salary and a large family is struggling to make his salary meet his necessities and at the same time to secure for his children an education Hart Gordon Woman and the Race Pp 264 Price ioo Westwood Mass The Ariel Press 19o7 The author deals in a very striking manner with the relation between modern women and the social organism

and yet each year thousands of children are born whose mothers only preparation for caring for the future generation has in a great number of cases been secured from playmates and companions whose ideas were not of the most desirable Neither in the school nor in the home are men and women prepared for their reciprocal relations in life and the marriage contract has generated into a mere joining together of persons who are often dissimilar in every thought and habit Upon the knowledge or lack of knowledge of these mothers and fathers will depend the joy or misery health or sickness happiness or wretched ness of millions of children The author shows a wide knowledge and expresses his thought in a way that deserves an audience seldom accorded to a modern book not in novel form Hazen Allen Clean Water and How to Get It Pp x 178 New York John Wiley  Sons 1907 It is seldom that one finds a book dealing with a technical subject which has the universal interest of Mr Hazens recent volume In the localities where the population is increasingly denser every year the problem of preventing or overcoming contamination and pollution of the water supply is constantly more difficult to solve Few muricipalities can afford or are so situated as to be able to control the entire catchment area from which their water supply is derived The opening chapters of the book deal with the relative advantages and disadvantages of the usual sourcesreservoirs lakes rivers and ground water The river in most cases in the United States is the only source from which a sufficient quantity is available The methods and devices for purifying water and the operation of systems under filtration form the main theme of the book Throughout the volume the experiences of various American cities are cited a fact which adds greatly to its practical value One chapter in particular on the use and measurement of water could be read with great profit by the citizens of many American cities where the daily consumption per capita with no meters is excessive Mr Hazen contends that such waste of water is needless increasing the cost of supply by onethird or onehalf Mr Hazens other contention is that no man will object to paying for a supply of clean water The book is a valuable as well as an interesting exposition of the most important question in presentday municipal problems Holman Frederick V Dr John

Manor and Manorial Records Pp xv 357 Price 300 New York E P Dutton  Co 1906 This is a good book It belongs to the series known as The Antiquarys Books although the American imprint does not state that fact It will be understood then that it is not primarily a work of investigation The author however uses documents freely for purposes of illustration and his book obtains thereby much of the clearness and force usually accompanying work drawn immediately from the original sources He has evidently examined many manorial records though his generalizations are not drawn from them but from the books of other men about them These secondary works which he has utilized are in the main the best books on the subject For the early period he has been especially dependent on Vinogradoff Growth of the Manor and to a less degree on the same authors Villainage in England Altogether the work is a clear moderate sensible and readable description of the main characteristics of the medieval manor It is noticeable how much clearer the knowledge of the mediaevalBook Department 277 manor has become since it has been approached from an economic rather than from a legal point of view It is true that the manor is in some senses a legal conception But this aspect of the manor is vague artificial arbitrary com prehensible only by lawyers and in their minds quite detached from material reality Mr Hone gives such a definition in his preface A certain circuit of ground granted by the king to some baron or man of worth as an inher itance for him and his heirs with the exercise of such jurisdiction within the said compass as the king saw fit to grant and subject to the performance of such services and yearly rents as were by the grant required As one studies English history one searches in vain for any actual process such as here described and as one reads manorial recordsextents compotus rolls and court rolls the picture that rises in ones mind bears no resemblance whatever to the lawyers definition On the other hand the conception of the manor as primarily an agri cultural organization the demesne farm of the lord of the manor inter mingled with the small holdings of the tenants the whole held together by agricultural as well as legal and social bondsa little community carrying on its economic as well as its legal life under the control of and largely for the benefit of the lord of the manor we get something tangible which a fuller study of the records manorial and national steadily tends to clear up The material for such fuller study is shown to exist in great abundance by Mr Hones lists of court rolls given in his appendix This is a most valuable and serious contribution to the subject The main body of court rolls in the Public Record Office is already listed in the Deputy Keeper of the Rolls Series of Lists and Indexes No 6 In addition to this how ever Mr Hone has printed lists of the court rolls existing in the custody of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of the Land Revenue Office of the British Museum Lambeth Palace and the Bodleian Library These lists show the striking extent of these records It may be remarked that this bibliography discloses one of Mr Hones deficiencies his relative unfamiliarity with American and German work on his subject He makes no mention for instance of Ashley Page Gay or Cheyney Meitzen or Schmoller all of whom have contributed directly to his subject and a reading of whose contributions would have saved him from his weak or mistaken treatment of the commutation of services of the en closures of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries and perhaps of some of the other branches of his study Howe F C The British City Pp xvi 370o Price 150 New York Chas Scribners Sons 1907 Reserved for

subject in three general parts the first devoted to the many sides of life in London and what the real London and Londoner are the second part is devoted to the country folk and the third to the English spirit in general The most striking feature of the volume is the touch of local atmos phere giving the whole an air of reality in the readers mind and creating an entirely new appreciation of the forces which make things English so distinctive Many a page in the book rambles on rather aimlessly or with an over abundance of attention to minute details There is however an elusive charm about the book which seems to lie in this very approach to unconscious garrulousness It suggests Cranford with its gossipy ever delightful glimpses into the life of that provincial village It is a book for

Professor Jordan thinks so Kirkup Thomas An Inquiry into Socialism Pp 216 Price 175 New York Longmans Green  Co 1907 Students of socialism will welcome the reappearence in revised and enlarged form of Kirkups standard little manual which has been out of print since 189o It is an unpretending sympathetic eminently fair exposition of the claims of a reasonable socialism a statement and discussion of the objections to such a policy and a consideration of its place and prospects in the democratic society of the twentieth century Accordingly it will please neither the hidebound individualist who learned his economics in the preVictorian era nor the doctrinaire socialist who believes in the plenary inspiration of Karl Marx but it may be cordially recommended to everyone who wants to understand presentday socialism of the less extreme type While the author makes no attempt to cover the same ground gone over in his admirable History of Socialism he puts the socialistic move ment in its proper perspective by an introductory account of the rise and the character of capitalism Many readers will doubtless think Kirkup unduly favorable to socialism but after all we have passed the point when it seemed worth while to quarrel over names and should be ready to discuss every social policy on its merits Kirkups book is an honest and successful attempt to discuss socialistic ideas in that way

19o7 The book consists of a number of letters written by the author to a friend Its style is on the whole very entertaining and makes remarkably easy reading when contrasted with many books dealing with similar topics However there is not sufficient connection between the various letters to permit the reader to feel that he is reading a book but rather a number of short dissertations on several rather diverse topics Some of the earlier letters are brilliant in conception and the statements of theory are remark ably clear The first letter touches a vital chord in its description of the ambition which the average writer on socialism entertains of getting the ego before the theory The second letter is an attempt to show the importance of having the work of Marx and Engels clearly understood by the general public and particularly by students of socialism who are often deceived by misrepresentations concerning what Marx and Engels actually did say Chapter four is devoted to a discussion of the possibility of starting a school of materialism in France Chapters five six and seven deal in a280 The Annals of the American Academy very general and indefinite manner with the

Four interesting little books dealing with the problems of socialism and similar questions The Right to be Lazy is a translation by Charles H Kerr of a most interesting essay presenting the opposition to the ideas ordinarily advanced in modern AngloSaxon communities on the subject of work The author speaks of work as a thing to be dreaded rather than sought His essay is a plea for the modern member of industrial society who is sold to work and in his mania for working is forgetting to live and enjoy The essay carries this idea to an extreme not often seen and yet it contains a germ of truth which many of the members of our community particularly in our modern city would do well to note and heed The essay is strong well written and interesting and for the man who is studying modern economic problems well worth reading The chief thing in Capitalist and Laborer is Mr Spargos answer to an attack on socialism Like all of Mr Spargos work this answer is not brilliant but honest direct and dependable It contains stated in a very concise form the main doctrines of the modern socialist Socialism Positive and Negative by La Monte is a book of discon nected essays dealing with Science and Socialism Markism and Ethics The Nihilism of Socialism and like subjects There is no connection between the essays and on the whole they do not present as satisfactory a statement of the socialistic doctrines as does Mr Spargos book noted above Revolution and Counter Revolution contains a series of letters written by Karl Marx for the New York Tribune during the Revolution of 1848 in Germany For the first time these articles are collected and printed in book form While wholly historical they present a very interesting point of view on the German crisis in the middle of the last century This series of books represents an attempt by the publisher to place in handy and cheap form a number of essays dealing with socialism and socialistic problems The effort is a commendable one and it deserves public support because of the reasonable figures at which the material is pre sented to the public as well as for the value of the material itself Lee G W The Library and the Business

regulation of minimum wage investigation and arbitration of strikes and lockouts On examining the contents of the volume one is impressed with the part which the administrative power plays in such regulations in Europe the socalled legislation including both laws in our sense and ministerial and royal decrees The availability of any one report of this series is limited by the fact that many of the acts or ordinances are amendatory and hence must be construed by previous acts which are not given But the value of the whole is enhanced by the publication of a decennial table which classifies the legislation both by countries and by subjectsthe latter being especially interesting That there have been some oversights on the part of the individuals making the reports for the several countries is evidenced by the omission of two Pennsylvania statutes a workshop act of 1899 and a storeorder act of 1goi But notwithstanding such omissions the Belgian Office du Travail is making a noteworthy contribution to the subject Macrosty H W The Trust Movement in British Industry Pp xxi 398 Price 250 New York Longmans Green  Co 1907 This book is largely devoted to a statement of the

oppressed whether as slave and master or serf and lord this unnatural condition of society has always been overthrown and succeeded by some other system which likewise con tains oppressors and oppressed We are approaching a crisis with our system of wage worker and wage payer The thought is emphasized that this idea of change in our present system is not confined to visionary dreamers and pessimistic faultfinders In dealing with the trusts and their influence upon the development of the country the author takes a very pessimistic view Fully half of his book is devoted to this subjectand many interesting facts are presented regard ing trust oppression and trust methods which will be new to most readers Omitting the benefits derived from largescale production the author deals only with the wrongs which have arisen from the unjustified use of the power by large corporations The book concludes with statements showing how the reign of Christian socialism can be brought

Accidents Their Cause and Prevention Pp III Boston The Association of Railway Claim Agents 19o7 The author presents in a very interesting way the question of railway accidents his purpose being to render them less frequent and less severe by calling the attention of railroad companies and railroad employees to their really serious character and to the fact that in a great proportion of cases they are easily preventable by the exercise of a little care The book is a small one somewhat technical and written from the standpoint of a person who understands railroading It divides accidents into four classes First those unavoidable or284 The Annals of the American Academy those caused by the act of God or the public enemy secondly accidents to passengers and other outsiders due partly to their own negligence thirdly those due to the want of care on the part of the management and fourthly those caused by the carelessness or neglect of employees These various groups are again subdivided the character of individual accidents pointed out and remedies suggested in each case The author livens up the work by printing a large number of actual instances of accidents to prove his theories His general conclusion in regard to the cause of accidents is not at all specific and the remedies proposed are very vague The book is written for railroad employees rather than the general public

significant giving the keynote to that stormy period immediately following the establishment by the Congress of Vienna of the union of Belgium and Holland The author writes from the Catholic and of

necessarilymake his work unscientific much of the material used is new being drawn directly from the Vatican and other archives His thesis is that the religious question was one of the leading if not the first cause of the overthrow of the Kingdom of the United Netherlands and hence of the independence of Belgium After treating the difficulties between William I and the Holy See the work shows how the conflict resulted in the unexpected alliance between Liberals and Catholics and this unnatural alliance the author claims guaranteed the success of the Belgian revolution Space prevents an

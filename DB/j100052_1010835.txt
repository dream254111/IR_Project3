ENTHUSIASM LEADS HIM TO PAINT THE CHINESE ARE TO PEOPLE THE VAST WILDERNESS OF BORNEO THEY ARE TO BE THE DOMINANT RACE OF THE EASTERN TROPICS THROUGH INTERMARRIAGE WITH THE NATIVES THEY ARE TO BE THE INTELLECTUAL NATION OF THE ORIENT AND THEY WILL LARGELY CONTROL ORIENTAL COMMERCE BEFORE THE MIDDLE OF THIS CEN TURY ALL OF THESE CONCLUSIONS ARE DERIVED BY THE AUTHOR FROM AN ANALYSIS OF CHINESE CHARACTER AND THINGS CHINESE IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT HOWEVER TO FOLLOW SOME OF THE LEAPS IN HIS LOGIC FROM THE POLITICAL STANDPOINT MR BREWSTER REGARDS CHINA AS A GREAT PEOPLE BUT AN IMBECILE STATE COMMERCIALLY SOUND BUT POLITICALLY ROTTEN THIS CONDITION HE ASCRIBES TO THE PRESENCE OF THE MANCHU RULERS A NON CHINESE DYNASTY ON THE THRONE AND THE UNIVERSAL EVIL OF POLITICAL GRAFT WHICH FROM EXAMPLES CITED MUST EVEN SURPASS THAT OF OUR OWN MORE EN LIGHTENED WESTERN CIVILIZATION THE REMEDY FOR THE FIRST OF THESE EVILS WILL BE FOUND IN THE IMPENDING CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT AND FOR THE LATTER IN THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY BY WHICH LOYALTY TO THE STATE WILL BE MADE TO REPLACE THE PRESENT ATTITUDE OF ANCESTOR WORSHIP AND SELFISH INTERESTS THE LOW INDUSTRIAL CONDITION IS NOT TO BE ATTRIBUTED TO OVERPOPULATION UNPRODUCTIVE SOIL LAZINESS OR INTELLECTUAL INCAPACITY BUT TO THE FACT THAT THE BRAIN AND THE BRAWN ARE NOT UNITED IN SUPPORT OF THIS ARGU MENT THE AUTHOR DRAWS VERY VIVID PICTURES OF THE PRIMITIVE METHODS EN COUNTERED IN EVERY FIELD OF LABOR HE BELIEVES FIRMLY IN THE SOLUTION BY INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION BUT WEAKENS HIS ARGUMENT BY ASSUMING THAT THE EDU CATION IS TO COME FROM MISSIONARIES UNFORTUNATELY THE AVERAGE MISSIONARY KNOWS ALL TOO LITTLE ABOUT FARMING IMPLEMENTS AND MACHINE SHOPS MR BREWSTERS ENTHUSIASM FOR HIS WORK APPEARS TO HAVE OBSCURED HIS RECOGNITION OF THE FACT THAT TRADE AND COMMERCE AND GENERAL WORLD INTERCOURSE ARE THE FACTORS WHICH HAVE LIFTED NATIONS IN THE PAST AND MUST BE EXPECTED TO DO THE MAJOR PART OF THE WORK IN THE FUTURE THE MAIN THEME OF THE BOOK APPEARS TO BE THAT MISSIONS AND THE SPREAD OF CHRISTIANITY WILL PROVE THE SOLUTION OF ALL DIFFICULTIES AND MAKE CHINA THE FOREMOST NATION OF THE EAST BUT THE EXPERIENCE IN JAPAN AND RECENT

BOOK BEGINS THEREFORE WITH A LONG AND REALLY GOOD DIS CUSSION OF HEREDITY OUR CRITICISM UPON THESE FIRST ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY PAGES IS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS ALLOWED HIMSELF TO BE DRAWN TOO MUCH INTO

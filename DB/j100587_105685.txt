LET TER TO PHILIP CARTERET WEBB ESQ F R S FROM DANIEL C SOLANDER M D DEAR SIR A F T E R BEGGING YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF MY VERY SINCERE THANKS FOR THE MANY CIVILITIES YOU WERE PLEASED TO HONOUR ME WITH WHILE I WAS AT YOUR DELIGHTFUL RETIREMENT AT BUSBRIDGE I SHALL WITH PLEASURE ACQUIT MY SELF OF MY PROMISE TO GIVE YOU THE BEST HISTORICAL ACCOUNT IN MY POWER OF THE GAR DENIA JASMINOIDES TOGETHER WITH SOME FEW OBSERVA TIONS ON THE SAME PLANT READ DEC 23 1762 THE GARDENIA IS AT PRESENT WELL KNOWN AMONG THE ENGLISH GARDENERS BY NAME OF THE CAPE JASMINE THO IT HAS BEEN BUT A FEW YEARS IN THIS COUNTRY IT WAS FIRST BROUGHT HERE 1744 FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BY CAPTAIN HUTCHENSON IN THE GODOLPHIN INDIAMAN AND BY HIM PRESENTED TO RICHARD WARNER ESQ OF WOODFORD ROW ESSEX IN WHOSE GARDEN IT LONG REMAIN ED WITHOUT THE LEAST SIGN OF VEGETATION BUT AT LAST PROVED TO BE THE MOST BEAUTIFUL SHRUB THAT HAS BEEN INTRODUCED AMONG US FOR A LONG TIME AND INDEED THE BOTANIC WORLD IS AS MUCH INDEBTED TO THE ABOVE NAMED GENTLEMANFOR HIS SKILL AND CARE IN THE PRESERVA TION OF THE PLANT AS FOR HIS GENEROSITY IN COMMUNI CATING IT TO THE PUBLIC WHEN THIS PLANT FIRST SHEWED ITSELF IT WAS THOUGHT A NEW AND UNKNOWN ONE TO THE EUROPEAN BOTANISTS AND THO IT CAME TO BLOSSOM FREELY THE FLOWERS UN FORTUNATELY655 FORTUNATELY PROVED DOUBLE FOR NOTWITHSTANDING THE FRUCTIFICATION IS THE ONLY MATERIAL THING IN PLANTS WHENCE THEY CAN BE SUFFICIENTLY KNOWN AND DESCRIBED YET DOUBLE FLOWERS ARE REALLY A KIND OF MONSTERS IN THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM AS THEIR PRINCIPAL PARTS ARE TOO MUCH ALTERED AND DISTORTED FOR ANY THING TO BE DE TERMINED FROM THEM WITH CERTAINTY IT THEREFORE STILL REMAINED A DIFFICULTY TO ASCERTAIN WHAT TRIBE THIS SHRUB BELONGED TO AND THE ONLY WAY OF FORMING ANY JUDGMENT WAS CONSIDERING ALL ITS PARTS ACCURATE LY COMPARING THEM WITH OTHER KNOWN PLANTS AND THUS BY ANALOGY FINDING OUT ITS AFFINITY AND THENCE ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE VEGETABLE SYSTEM AT FIRST IT WAS THOUGHT TO BE A SPECIES OF JASMINE  AS I SUPPOSE FROM SOME DISTANT LIKENESS AND THE FRAGRANCY OF ITS FLOWERS BUT AS IT HARDLY AGREED IN ANY OTHER PARTI CULAR IT WAS AFTERWARDS DOUBTED IF IT COULD PROPER LY BE REFERRED TO THAT TRIBE  AND AT LAST JOHN ELLIS ESQ F R S DECLARED THIS PLANT TO BE A DISTINCT GENUS AND GAVE IT THE NAME OF GARDENIA  THIS GENTLEMAN CONCLUDED THAT THE PLANT THEN IN QUESTION MUST BE VERY DIFFERENT FROM A JASMINE AS WELL FROM THE UNLIKENESS IN ITS LEAVES AND STIPULAS AS PRINCIPALLY FROM THE SEEDVESSEL BEING PLACED BELOW THE RECEPTACLE OF THE FLOWER BUT NOT CHOOSING TO ADVANCE THIS UPON HIS OWN AUTHORITY HE SENT AN ACCOUNT OF IT WITH DRYED SPECIMENS TO DOCTOR LINNAEUS AT UPSAL WHOSE KNOWN EXTENSIVE SKILL IN EVERY PART OF NATURAL HISTORY HAS REN DERED HIS OPINION AMONG ALL THE PROFESSORS OF THAT SCI ENCE TO BE OF THE BEST AUTHORITY THE DOCTOR ANSWERED THAT THE SITUATION OF THE SEEDVESSEL AND THE PECULI  MILLER DICT AND FIG  EHRET FIG  PHIL TRANS 1760 P 929 VOL LII P ARITY656 ARITY OF THE CALYX WERE SUFFICIENT TO PERSUADE HIM OF ITS BEING A NEW GENUS BUT AS THE STAMINA MUST BE UNCERTAIN IN DOUBLE FLOWERS HE COULD NOT THEN UNDERTAKE TO DETERMINE ITS CHARACTERS HOWEVER SOON AFTERWARDS DR LINNAEUS WROTE WORD THAT HE HAD FOUND A SINGLE FLOWER OF THIS SAME PLANT AMONG SOME SPECIMENS FROM THE EAST INDIES AND NO LONGER SCRUP LED TO AGREE TO MRELLISS DETERMINATION OF THE GARDENIA THERE WANTED NOTHING THEN BUT AN ACCOUNT OF THE FRUIT AND ESPECIALLY THE NUMBER OF SEEDS AND MR ELLIS WHO WAS WELL ACQUAINTED WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THE MOST MINUTE PARTS OF NATURE SOON DISCOVERED THAT THE SEEDVESSEL CONTAINED RUDIMENTS OF MANY SEEDS THO IT SEEMS THE VERACITY OF THIS PARTICULAR HAS BEEN MUCH QUESTIONED WHICH NO DOUBT HAS AROSE FROM THE IMPERFECT STATE THAT ALL FRUITS AND SEEDS COMMONLY APPEAR IN AFTER DOUBLE FLOWERS AS IN THE PRESENT CASE BUT IT WAS MY GOOD FORTUNE WHILE I WAS AT YOUR MOST AGREEABLE SEAT AT BUSBRIDGE AND WHERE YOU INDULGED ME WITH A SIGHT OF YOUR CURIOUS COLLECTIONS OF DRYED PLANTS TO DISCOVER A SPECIMEN OF THIS SHRUB IN PERFECT FRUIT GATHERED BY MR CUNNINGHAM IN THE EAST INDIES WHERE THAT GENTLEMAN TRAVELLED FOR DIS COVERY OF NATURAL CURIOSITIES UPON MY DECLARING THIS YOU WAS SO OBLIGING AS TO PERMIT MY DIS SECTING THE FRUIT FOR EXAMINATION WHEN YOU RE MEMBER SIR WE HAD THE SATISFACTION TO FIND THAT THE GENERICAL CHARACTERS OF THE GARDENIA GIVEN BY MR ELLIS IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL LI P 929 WERE VERY COMPLEAT I WILL ONLY BEG LEAVE TO ADD A FEW PARTICULARS THAT COULD NOT BE SEEN IN AN IMPER FECT OR IMMATURE FRUIT THE SEEDVESSEL WHEN RIPE IS EGGSHAPED OUT WARDLY RIBBED FROM THE DESCENDING WINGS OF THE FLOWER657 FLOWERCUP AND WITHIN DIVIDED INTO TWO CELLS BY A THIN MEMBRANACEOUS PARTITION THE SEEDS ARE MANY AT LEAST MORE THAN FIFTY IN EACH CELL COMPRESSED AND SURROUNDED WITH A MUCILAGINOUS SUBSTANCE THE MUCILAGE HERE MENTIONED WAS SO LITTLE HARD NED IN THE FRUIT I EXAMINED THAT THE SEEDS THEMSELVES WERE QUITE SOFT AND INCLINING TO BE MOIST RECOLLECTING THAT DR PLUKENET HAD FIGURED MANY OF MR CUNNIGHAMS PLANTS I HAD RECOURSE TO HIS GAZAPHYLACIUM AND THERE FOUND AN ENGRAVING OF THIS PLANT PLATE 448 N 4 AND THAT IT WAS TWICE MENTIONED IN HIS AMALTHEUM PAGES 29 212 FROM THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH DR PLUKENET  MR PETIVER AND MR RAY  HAVE RECEIVED FROM MR CUN NINGHAM I LEARNED THAT THE CHINESE USE THE SEEDS OF GARDENIA JASMINOIDES AS A SCARLET DYE AND AS THE MUCILAGINOUS SUBSTANCE IN WHICH THE SEEDS ARE INVOLV ED SEEMS TO BE VERY COPIOUS AND RICH OF COLOUR I IMAGINE IT MUST BE WORTH ENQUIRY WHETHER THIS SHRUB MAY NOT BE FOUND AND TRANSPORTED TO SUCH OF THE BRITISH COLONIES WHERE IT MIGHT BE PROPAGATED AND PERHAPS BECOME ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL PLANTS AS IT IS NOW ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL I HAVE TRYED THESE SEEDS IN WATER SPIRITS AND OTHER LIQUORS AND ALLWAYS FOUND THEM TINGE THE MENSTRUUM YELLOW NOTWITHSTANDING THEY HAVE BEEN GATHERED NEAR FOUR SCORE YEARS  SEMINA TINCTORIBUS INSERVIUNT IIS ENIM AB

THING I WILL NOT OMIT MENTI ONING AS IT MAY IN SOME MEASURE ACCOUNT FOR THE UNEQUAL NUMBER OF THE DIVISIONS IN THE DOUBLE BLOSSOMS IT IS THAT SOME OF THE SPECIMENS AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM HAVE THEIR CALYX DIVIDED INTO FIVE AND OTHERS INTO SIX SIGMENTS OR WINGS WHICH SHEW THAT THE INEQUALITY IS NOT ALTOGETHER PECULIAR TO THE DOUBLE FLOWERS AND I HAVE HAD DRAWINGS MADE FROM THE BEST SAMPLES I COULD

BE ENQUIRED INTO NAMELY THE NATIVE PLACE OF THIS SHRUB THAT IT GROWS SPONTANEOUSLY IN CHINA AND THE NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES I DO NOT IN THE LEAST DOUBT BECAUSE DR LINNAEUS HAS HAD HIS SPECIMEN FROM THENCE AND MR CUNNINGHAM TELLS US IN HIS TIME IT WAS FOUND THERE IN SUCH PLENTY THAT THEY COULD COLLECT AND USE ITS SEEDS FOR DYING NEITHER DO I DOUBT THAT CAPT HUTCHENSON PROCURED THE PLANT HE BROUGHT OVER FROM THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE ESPECIALLY AS THERE ARE SPECIMENS OF IT WITH DOUBLE BLOS SOMS AMONG THE CURIOUS PLANTS THAT WERE BROUGHT OVER FROM THAT PLACE TO MR DESMARETS NOW IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM HORT SICC CCLXI P 30 BUT AS THOSE HAVE DOUBLE FLOWERS AND HAVING NEVER HEARD OF ANY WITH SINGLE BLOSSOMS BEING GATHERED IN THAT COUNTRY I CAN SCARCE BELIEVE IT IS AN INDIGENOUS PLANT THERE BUT RATHER IMAGINE THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THITHER FROM THE EAST INDIES EITHER BY ACCIDENT OR FOR THEIR GARDENS I MUST ONCE MORE TAKE THE LIBERTY TO REPEAT THAT AS THIS PLANT MAY PROBABLY BE OF REAL BENEFIT BY IM PROVING THE ART OF DYING I WOULD BEG LEAVE THERE FORE TO RECOMMEND IT TO YOU AND ALL OTHER SUCH PUBLIC SPIRITED GENTLEMEN TO USE YOUR BEST ENDEAVOURS FOR DISCOVERING AND BRINGING OVER FROM THE EAST INDIES SOME SINGLE BLOSSOMED PLANTS OR THE SEEDS OF THE GARDENIA AND AFTERWARDS TO CONSIDER OF THE PROPEREST PLACE FOR PLANTING AND CULTIVATING THEM FOR SO VALUA BLE AN END AND IF

have secured some of his sketches The Japanese are a most amiable and polite people but they must have been amazed and perhaps amused at the per sistency with which the artist went about peering behind their screens under their mats and into their closets We however have no reason to complain for he has seen for us far more than we could have seen for ourselves and has brought to us such a budget of facts and such a portfolio of illustrations as we could not have gathered for ourselves in a lifetime In any country a dwellinghouse is the product of complicated causes Climate the prevalence of destructive agencies the character of the mate rial available the skill of the mechanics the wealth of the people the growth of artificial physical wants the development of a taste for the beautiful and refined in life  all these are potential causes in determining the character of the dwelling These causes account for most of the peculiarities of the Japanese house as com pared with our own From time immemorial Japan has been visited by earthquakes and typhoons These will explain why the Japanese builds his house as low as possible and prefers wood to stone The climate is mild and does not demand the formidable provision against the cold with which we are familiar This may account for the absence of chimneys and stoves It puz zles us however to understand why the Japanese who has shown such cleverness in the develop ment of many of the arts of civilized life has made so little progress in others In 1542 the Portuguese landed on the southern islands of Japan and left there among other traces of their visit a number of the matchlock guns which were in common use in Europe at that time After the lapse of more than three hundred years you can see the hunter of today out on the hills with a gun which is of the identical pattern which the Portuguese brought thither The Japanese gun smith has found out how to make the matchlock a far more ornamental weapon than it was in the hands of the Portuguese He has decorated the stock and inlaid the barrel with gold and silver and provided it with exquisite fittings but still it is the same old matchlock without a single effective part changed or improved Such absence of progress is surprising but it does not surprise us half so much as their marked superiority in other and more difficult arts In the modelling and decoration of pottery in ornamental metal work in weaving and embroidery in painting carving and enamelling in the exquisite work 43 manship of their lacquer wares their achieve ments put them in the very first rank In all these departments of industry the Japanese now have an acknowledged position It has not been so well known that in many of the humbler departments their work is scarcely less to be ad mired Professor Morse has given us in this volume sufficient evidence of the excellence of their carpentry and joinery of their skill in gar dening and of their cleverness in making both house and garden contribute not only to the physical comfort but to the intellectual pleasure of the occupants We are specially indebted to the author for exhibiting to us so clearly the in ternal arrangements of a Japanese dwellinghouse and the domestic routine which goes on in it and the evidences of comfort and refinement which are everywhere seen The beautiful products of their ornamental arts have become familiar to us and are almost as much at home in our houses as in theirs But the implements of common life are still strange to us and we are thankful to Pro fessor Morse who in this book has given us so much information about them I need only men tion such illustrations as those of a carpenters tools of a thatched roof of the interiors of dwellinghouses of a kitchen range of their bathtubs and lavatories of their candlesticks and lamps of their wells and waterbuckets of their gardens and gardenlamps to show how varied and interesting are the contents We are sure that Professor Morses portfolio is not yet ex hausted and it only remains for us to express the wish that in due time he may open for us another instalment of his delightful wares PHYSICAL EXPRESSION IN the term physical expression Dr Warner includes all those changes of form and feature occurring in the body which may be interpreted as evidences of mental action Such changes are taking place constantly and in response to all kinds of mental impressions The majority of them are involuntary and so far trustworthy it being the height of art to simulate a feeling suc cessfully At first thought it would seem that facial expression is the most important of these outward signs of inner processes but a little observation will convince one that the posture assumed by the body  the poise of the head and the position of the hands  as well as the many alternations of color and of general nutrition are just as striking evidences of the course of thought And such changes may be permanent as well as Physical expression its modes and principles By FRANCIS WARNER MD International scientifie series New York Appleton 1885 12 JANUARY 8 188644 SCIE temporary thus displaying the general caste of mind as well as the transient emotion by which the individual is excited The subject thus de veloped by the author becomes quite extensive and is exceedingly interesting By studying it in animals and infants in whom the higher mental control which often modifies involuntary changes of expression in adults is absent by showing its practical application in enabling one to read char acter and by drawing from the realms of art as well as nature for his illustrations Dr Warner has succeeded in bringing together an entertain ing series of facts and deducing from them some instructive conclusions We all believe that we can detect the real feelings of others in their faces and that we can successfully conceal from others our own thoughts How difficult both processes may become and yet how fully they repay some study the readers of this very pleasing work will learn In the last chapter the author describes an ingenious piece of apparatus by means of which the motions of the hand may be graphically recorded in those diseases in which irregular move ments occur He has evidently made some study of such affections as the facts recorded in chapter vii show How far such a chapter may be gener ally appreciated in a popular work is questionable as the terms employed would be intelligible only to physicians But the subject would have been incomplete had the changes of expression incident to disease not been alluded to To those who are curious to go into the subject more deeply than is possible in a popular treatise the bibliography on pp 344346 will be of service The work is fully up to the high standard maintained in this series and is by no means the least interesting of the volumes already published M A S REFORMS IN ENGLISH PUBLIC SCUOOLS THE public schools of which Mr Cotterill writes are British not American and his startingpoint is ahead of any thing that can be proposed as an im mediate goal in other countries  ahead at any rate in this that English public schools already as a matter of fact are nurseries of character quite as much as institutions of learning Mr Cotterills suggestions are mostly in the line of character Health of character is for him the end of educa tion He is down on competitive examinations of a severe sort would have a test of proficiency in bodily exercises introduced into those of the In dian civil service believes in making outdoor exercise compulsory on all boys three days in the Suggested reforms in public schools By C C COTTERILL MA Edinburgh and London Blackwood 1885 12 1 CEV VOL VII No 153 week each boy  changing into his flannels for the purpose would restrict the tuckshop facili ties the boys now have and disbelieves in giving them too much help whether intellectual or physi cal Translations and aid from the teacher beyond a certain point are in his eyes equally bad and the boys ought to prepare their own cricket grounds and take care of their own play with less professional aid than they now appear to get in the larger schools He believes in  manual training thoroughly for a variety of reasons not least among which is that it widens sympathy among classes The book is a refreshing example of the sort of spirit the English public schools even in their present unreformed condition engender and increases the readers desire to see them imitated here on a larger scale than hereto fore THE government of Tasmania are according to Nature making arrangements upon a large scale for naturalizing lobsters crabs turbot brill and other European fishes in the waters of that country The various consignments will be shipped at Plym outh and transported through the medium of the steamship companies trading between London and Hobart An exhaustive report has been published by the Government of Tasmania setting forth the objects in view and giving suggestions for carry ing them into effect The report adds that while the achievement of the acclimatization of Euro pean fishes would lay the foundation of new and very valuable fishing industries in Tasmania it might also prove a highly remunerative commer cial enterprise to the shipping firms under whose auspices the operations will be conducted Appli cations have been made in various quarters for supplies of fish which have been satisfactorily re sponded to Special tanks are being prepared as well as apparatus in order to provide for the necessities of the fish en route which it is antici pated can be transmitted with little difficulty The success that has hitherto attended the accli matization of certain European fishes in New Zea land has had the effect of inspiring the government of that colony with considerable enterprise in de veloping their fisheries They are now about to collect the ova of Salmonidae from English waters in large numbers through the instrumentality of the National fishculture association and other bodies with a view to rearing the fry in New Zealand A shipment of eggs will also shortly be sent to Australia where great success has attended the introduction of our fishes except in a few instances when failure resulted more from mis adventure than from the impracticability of the attempt

of Wisconsin The value of studying foreign languages aside from the direct use of the modern languages has been very much overestimated in some quarters and perhaps equally underestimated in other quar ters The controversy over the amounts of pure intellectual dis cipline of the various branches of instruction has been the warmest in the field of the languages particularly the ancient ones As a matter of fact however the controversy could be just as animated in the field of the sciences when one recalls the distorted claims of discipline made for them in certain quarters This article will present some definite data on the amount of disciplinary or derived value of certain aspects of studying foreign languages It is not claimed to present a complete measure of one or of all phases of such study but it is certain that definite objective facts and measurements are far superior to individual opinions based on haphazard instances Scholastic records of students presenting different languages for college entranceThe first problem considered was a comparison of the scholastic records of university students who had entered the university with two to four years of Latin with the records of those who had entered with two to four years of German The average grade for the four years of college work of each of the graduates of the College of Letters and Science of the year 191o was computed The median mark of the I04 students who had entered the univer sity with Latin was 857 and the median mark of the 45 students who had entered with German was 840 Hence the difference between the two groups is only I 7 points The explanation for this small advantage of Latin over German may be sought in three directions First the disciplinary difference between Latin and German is either zero or very small Second 697THE SCHOOL REVIEW whatever difference they may have produced originally may have tended to disappear in the four years of college work owing to the freedom of electives pursuit of different courses disciplinary effect of other studies etc Third the small difference in scholastic records may be due to an original difference in the students them selves owing to the possibility that one language may attract a better class of pupils than another It seems very probable that if any real difference exists it is due chiefly to the third reason To determine what part if any the first two factors played the average grade of each of the 738 Freshmen of the year I909Io was computed The median grade of the 416 Freshmen who had entered with Latin was 824 and that of the 322 Freshmen who had entered with German was 8Io Hence the difference between the two groups was only I 4 points or approximately the same as that for the graduates The next problem was to compare the grades of these two groups in specific subjects as follows Median grade in modern languages of 362 Freshmen who had entered with Latin   845 Median grade in modem languages of 293 Freshmen who had entered w ith G erm an  823 Difference in favor of the Latin group  22 Median grade in Freshman English of 54 students who had entered with Latin only  839 Median grade in Freshman English of 97 students who had entered with German only  827 Difference in favor of the Latin group   2 Median grade in firstyear French of 27 Freshmen who had entered with L atin only  8I5 Median grade in firstyear French of 34 Freshmen who had entered with G erm an only  820 Difference in favor of the German group   05 The differences again are very small The claim of language teachers so commonly made that beginners in French who have had Latin are much superior to those who have not had Latin or that students in English with previous training in Latin are superior to those without such training is ill founded It is another example 698THE VALUE OF STUDYING FOREIGN LANGUAGES so common in educational thinking of generalizing from striking isolated cases What differences do exist are due primarily to the selection of students The pupils who entered the university with Latin were on the average better but only slightly better pupils before they studied Latin than those who undertook German The traditions in many high schools have been such that somewhat better pupils have tended to select Latin Another tabulation Table I was made to show the scholar ship records of Freshmen in relation to the amount of foreign languages studied irrespective of what the languages were TABLE I Years of Foreign Number of Median Grade in All Languages Students Freshman Studies 0  25

through the study of Latin The method employed for determining the size of a persons English vocabulary has been described elsewhere and hence will not be dis cussed here Suffice it to say that the method employed measures the percentage of the entire English vocabulary as well as the approximate absolute number of words whose meaning a given per son knows sufficiently well to use them correctly

Juniors who had not studied Latin 502 D Starch Educational Measurements in press Macmillan 699THE SCHOOL REVIEW The differences between the Latin and the noLatin groups are surprisingly small One of the reasons commonly urged for the study of Latin is its tendency to increase the students English vocabulary The difficulty in the situation lies in the fact that while many English words are derived from Latin sources the mean ings of the English words are often so warped or distantly derived that it is necessary to learn the specific meanings Simply to recog nize that boaconstrictor contains the root constringere to draw together will not teach a pupil that it means a certain kind of rep tile So far as the rootmeaning is concerned the word might have been applied to scores of things that contract This point was brought out forcibly by the students on whom the test was made The Latin students recognized in many instances the presence of Latin roots in the English words used in the test but they could not be sure of the specific meanings without having definitely ascer tained them In many instances they would ascribe by inference from the rootwords entirely erroneous meanings Nevertheless the study of Latin does produce an appreciably larger English vocabulary This advantage becomes less in university students with whom it is partly counterbalanced by the increase in vocabu lary due to wider experience Effect of studying foreign languages upon knowledge of English grammar and upon correctness of usage of EnglishThe final prob lem was to ascertain to what extent the study of foreign languages increases a pupils knowledge of English grammar and to what extent if at all it increases correct use of the English language The methods by which correctness of usage and technical knowledge of grammar were measured have been described elsewhere In brief the test for usage consisted of a set of one hundred sentences each of which was stated in two ways The task of the pupil con sisted in indicating the correct forms Technical knowledge of grammar was measured by certain tests involving the designation of parts of speech cases tenses and modes These tests were made upon 54 university Juniors and Seniors and 146 highschool pupils They gave the results shown in Table II in which the scores for knowledge of grammar are the numbers of the parts of speech The

university stu dents and 92 highschool pupils This test yielded the results given in Table III The scores are the numbers of the highest steps passed The higher the score is the greater is the ability of using English correctly These tables agree in showing one very significant result namely that the study of foreign languages materially increases a pupils knowledge of English grammar but only slightly increases his ability in the correct usage of the English language Notice for example the upper part of Table II The students who had Io to I5 years of foreign languages made a score in grammatical knowledge of 63 70ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW as compared with a score of 478 made by the students who had 2 to 5 years of foreign languages a difference of 326 per cent in favor of the former group For correctness of usage the corre sponding difference is only 64 per cent The two students with no foreign languages made high scores because they were exception ally good students but they are too few in number to be considered The highschool pupils show a gain in grammatical knowledge of 375 per cent from the 8week group to the 3year group and a gain in usage of only io 9 per cent The I2 pupils with no foreign lan guage made low scores because they were exceptionally poor pupils This is indicated by their low scholarship records by the fact that TABLE III Years of Latin Number of Pupils Average Scores UNIVERSITY STUDENTS 0  47 IOI 6  99 io2 HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS o 78 90 I4  4 93 many were overage by the fact that they avoided the foreign languages and also by the large difference between their scores and those of the 50 pupils who were just beginning foreign languages Eight weeks of foreign languages could hardly have produced such a big gain Their higher scores must be due to a difference in original nature The same facts are brought out by the comparison for Latin alone The gain of the 5ormoreyear group over the oyear group in grammatical knowledge is 349 per cent and in cor rect usage only 73 per cent Latin obviously has no advantage over any other foreign language in increasing grammatical knowl edge or usage of English Incidentally the implication may also be pointed out that knowl edge of grammar has very little effect upon correct usage The large increases in grammatical knowledge are accompanied by only very small increases in correct usage Correct usage is primarily a matter of establishing correct habits of speech and grammatical 702THE VALUE OF STUDYING FOREIGN LANGUAGES knowledge is useful only in so far as it helps to establish such habits Apparently imitation and repetition of correct expression are far more efficacious in forming correct habits than grammatical knowl edge The recent tendency to reduce the time devoted to formal grammar and to postpone the study of it to later years is in accord with these findings The argument often advanced for the study of foreign languages and particularly for Latin that they are a great aid in the use and comprehension of English is unfounded Arguments of this kind are unnecessary Why should we not study Latin on its own account as a language and as a guide to a literature of its own  Its aid as well as that of any other foreign language in facilitating the use of English is very small Why not recognize this as a fact  If you wish to know English study English but not via Latin or some other language If you wish to know Latin study Latin for its own sake primarily an end sufficiently worthy in itself The aid of one language in the study of another is only incidental and unimportant at least so far as present methods of teaching foreign languages go The figures presented should not be interpreted as an argument against foreign languages or particularly against Latin but rather against certain assumed disciplinary transferred or derived benefits SummaryThe scholastic records of students in the university entering with Latin are only to a slight and negligible extent better than those of students entering with German Likewise the scholastic records in modern languages either beginning or ad vanced or in English of students entering with Latin are only to a very slight extent better than those of students entering with German This slight difference is probably due to an inherent difference in the students rather than to a difference produced by these languages The English vocabulary of pupils who had studied Latin was 27 per cent larger than the vocabulary of those who had not studied Latin in the case of university students and 45 per cent larger in the case of highschool pupils The study of foreign languages materially increases a students knowledge of English grammar but only slightly increases his ability to use English correctly 703

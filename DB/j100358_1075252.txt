J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075252,APPENDIX TO THE PAPER OF MR MERRITT STARR,I244596,VII APPENDIX TO THE PAPER OF MR MERRITT STARR AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO THE LITERATURE OF THE SUBJECT IS THE ADDRESS OF DEAN HENRY WADE ROGERS FORMERLY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN ON THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO THE DIFFERENT LAW SCHOOLS AND FOR THE DIFFERENT LEGAL DEGREES FROM WHICH I AM PERMITTED TO MAKE THE FOLLOWING EXTRACTS IN ENGLAND OXFORD UNIVERSITY DOES NOT CONFER THE LAW DEGREE UPON ONE WHO IS NOT A GRADUATE IN ARTS EITHER OF OXFORD UNIVERSITY OR OF SOME UNIVERSITY WHICH OXFORD IS WILLING TO RECOGNIZE IN SCOTLAND NO UNIVERSITY CAN CONFER THE DEGREE OF LLB ON ANYONE WHO HAS NOT ALREADY OBTAINED AN ARTS DEGREE IN IRELAND THE LLB DEGREE IS GRANTED AFTER TWO YEARS OF LAW STUDY TO THOSE WHO HOLD AN AB DEGREE IN FRANCE TO BE ENTERED AT THE COLE DE DROIT THE STUDENT IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE INTER ALIA THE DIPLOMA OF BACHELIER DE LETTRES OR IF HE HAS NOT STUDIED IN FRANCE AN EQUIVALENT QUALIFICATION NO AMERICAN LAW SCHOOL HAS AS YET CONDITIONED ITS LAW DEGREE ABSOLUTELY IN THE ATTAINMENT OF AN ACADEMIC DEGREE HARVARD IN I89697 MADE THE POSSESSION OF SUCH A DEGREE NECESSARY FOR MATRICULATION AS A REGULAR STUDENT BUT PERSONS WITHOUT SUCH A DEGREE CAN STILL BE ADMITTED AT HARVARD AS SPECIAL STUDENTS AND CAN OBTAIN THE LAW DEGREE IF THEY ATTAIN A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH STANDING ON THE EXAMINATIONS AND THE SAME RULE PRACTICALLY EXISTS AT COLUMBIA YALE UNIVERSITY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT BEGINNING WITH THE ACADEMIC YEAR 19O9 IT WILL REQUIRE STUDENTS TO HAVE HAD THE EQUIVALENT OF AT LEAST TWO FULL YEARS OF WORK OF COLLEGIATE GRADE TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE WORK IS ALSO TO BE REQUIRED OR IS ALREADY REQUIRED BY THE LAW SCHOOLS CONNECTED WITH THE STATE UNIVERSITIES OF NORTH CAROLINA OHIO WEST VIRGINIA AND WISCONSIN AND BY THAT OF TRINITY COLLEGE AT DURHAM NORTH CAROLINA WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE OTHER SCHOOLS WILL NO DOUBT TAKE SIMILAR ACTION WITH FOREIGN UNIVERSITIES INSISTING ON THE DEGREE REQUIREMENTS AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES CANNOT LONG REMAIN CONTENT WITH A DIPLOMA FROM A HIGH SCHOOL AS THE ADMISSION REQUIREMENT OF THEIR PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS A DISCUSSION IN THE BAR ASSOCIATION OF TEXAS IN 19OO SHEDS CONSIDERABLE 1 THE PRESIDENTS ADDRESS AT THE MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN LAW SCHOOLS AT ST PAUL AUGUST 30 9GO6CLASSICAL STUDIES AS A PREPARATION FOR LAW 435 LIGHT ON CONDITIONS IN THAT STATE ONE OF THE PROFESSORS OF THE LAW SCHOOL OF THE STATE UNIVERSITY DECLARED THAT PERSONS WERE BEING CONSTANTLY ADMITTED TO THE BAR OF TEXAS WHO WERE WITHOUT QUALIFICATIONS MANY OF THESE YOUNG MEN HE SAID SECURED LICENSE BY KNOWING WHAT QUESTIONS WOULD BE ASKED AND THROUGH THE KINDNESS OF SOME FRIEND ON THE BOARD OF EXAMINERS WHO WOULD SAY OH HE IS A COMMONSENSE FELLOW HE WILL MAKE A LAWYER SOME DAY  AND THE PRESIDENT OF THE ASSOCIATION IN 1894 IN HIS ADDRESS DECLARED THAT IN HIS EXPERIENCE OF NINETEEN YEARS HE COULD CALL TO MIND ONLY ONE APPLICANT WHO HAD BEEN REJECTED IN 1903 THE COMMITTEE ON LEGAL EDUCATION REPORTED IN FAVOR OF REQUIRING ALL APPLICANTS TO BE EXAMINED ON LITERARY SUBJECTS BUT THE ASSOCIATION AFTER A LENGTHY DISCUSSION REJECTED THE RECOMMENDATION ONE MEMBER WHO COULD NOT CONCEAL HIS CONTEMPT FOR THE SUGGESTION THAT APPLICANTS SHOULD PASS AN EXAMINA TION IN ELEMENTARY LATIN ANNOUNCED THAT THE DEAD LANGUAGES WERE DEAD AND HAD BEEN DEAD FOR A LONG TIME THAT HE HAD NEVER DERIVED ANY BENEFIT FROM THEM AND THAT HE WOULD NOT KNOW THEM IF HE MET THEM IN THE STREET ALL OF WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE WITHOUT IMPAIRING THE WISDOM AND VALUE OF THE COMMITTEES RECOM MENDATION BUT IN HIS MIND IT SETTLED THE MATTER CONCLUSIVELY AND AT ONCE AGAINST THE REPORT ANOTHER PARTICIPANT IN THE DISCUSSION WAS ONE WHO COULD SEE NO REASON FOR EXPECTING A LAWYER TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY AS HE HIMSELF WAS UNABLE TO TELL AS HE SAID WITHOUT SEVERE DELIBERATION WHETHER JAMES I FOLLOWED CHARLES I OR CHARLES II HE FRANKLY CONFESSED THAT HE DID NOT BELIEVE IT MADE AN IOTA OF DIFFERENCE WHETHER JAMES DIED BEFORE CHARLES WAS BORN OR WAS BORN AFTER CHARLES DIED STILL ANOTHER AGAIN RECURRING TO THE LATIN RECOM MENDATION EFFECTUALLY DISPOSED OF IT BY SAYING JUDGE BLECKLEY OF THE SUPREME COURT OF GEORGIA DONT KNOW ANY MORE ABOUT LATIN THAN A PIG AND YET HE IS ACKNOWLEDGED TO BE PERHAPS THE GREATEST LIVING JUDGE IN THE SOUTH TODAY HAV ING DISPOSED OF THE LATIN RECOMMENDATION IN THE MANNER INDICATED HE NEXT GAVE ATTENTION TO THE RECOMMENDATION AS TO MATHEMATICS DECLARING HIS CONVICTION THAT A KNOWLEDGE OF MATHEMATICS HAD NO BEARING WHATEVER ON ONES QUALIFICATIONS TO PRACTICE LAW HE DEMONSTRATED THE TRUTH OF HIS ASSERTION BY SAYING I BET THERE ARE NOT TWO LAWYERS PRESENT WHO CAN DEFINE THAT WORD QUADRATICS I KNOW I CANT TALK ABOUT REQUIRING THAT EXAMINATION I BET THERE ARE NOT FIVE LAWYERS PRESENT WHO CAN DEFINE WHAT IT MEANS OR CARE WHAT IT MEANS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE LONGER TO VIEW WITH COMPLACENCY THE CONFERRING OF THE LLB DEGREE FOR ONE YEAR OR EVEN TWO YEARS OF LAW STUDY NOW THAT THERE ARE SIXTYFOUR LAW SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY WHICH GRANT IT ONLY TO THOSE WHO HAVE STUDIED FOR THREE YEARS IT IS NOT LESS DISTURBING TO FIND SCHOOLS CONFERRING THE MASTERS DEGREE IN LAW AT THE END OF A SECOND OR THIRD YEAR

intitled  A Method of extending Cardans  Rule for resolving one Case of the Cubick Equation  x3  qx  r to the other Case of the same Equation  which it is not naturally fitted to solve and which is  therefore called the irreducible Case By Francis Maseres Esq F R S Cursitor Baron of the Exchequer Read Nov 4 1779 A R T I C L E I IN the abovementioned paper in the Philosophical Transactions the expression 3ex the infinite series 2  2ss9ee  20s4243e4  308s66561e6  c is shewn to be equal to the root of the equation x3  qx  r whenever rr4 is less than q327 but greater than one half of it or than q354 This expression is wholly transcendental or composed of an infinite number of terms to wit the terms of the se ries 2  2ss9ee  20s4243e4  308s66561e6  c multiplied into the cube root of e But I have since thought that it might be con venient on some occasions to divide this expression if possible into two others whereof the one should be a 3 mere86 Appendix to a Method of extending mere algebraick expression or consist of a finite num ber of terms and the other should be transcendental or involve in it an infinite series And I have accord ingly discovered a method of doing this which I will now proceed to describe ART 2 In the abovementioned paper in the Philo sophical Transactions I denoted the excess of q327 above rr4 in the second case of the equation x3  qx  r as well as the excess of rr4 above q327 in the first case of it by the letters ss But I have since thought that it might have been better to denote the excess of q327 above rr4 in the se cond case of that equation by the letters zz in order the more clearly to distinguish it from the opposite dif ference rr4  q327 in the first case of it which was denoted by ss And I therefore in the course of the following pages shall use the letters zz instead of ss to denote the said excess of q327 above rr4 in the second case of the said equation or the difference q327  rr4 ART 3 Now if zz be substituted instead of ss in the expression 3e x the infinite series 2  2ss9ee  20s4243e4    c that expression will thereby be converted in to the following expression to wit 3e x the infinite series 2  2zz9ee  20z4243e4  308z66561e6  c Therefore if rr4 be lessCARDANS Rule to the second Case c 87 less than q327 but greater than q354 and e be put  r2 and zz be put  q327  rr4 the root of the equation x3  qx  r will be equal to 3 e x the infinite series 2  2zz9ee  20z4243e4  308z66561e6  c ART 4 The numeral coefficients 29 20243 3086561 c of zzee z4e4 z6e6 c in this series are exactly double of 19 10243 1546561 c which are the numeral coefficients of the same powers of the fraction ze in the series 1  z3e  zz9ee  5z381e3  10z4243e4  22z5729e5  154z66561e6  2618z7137781e7  c which is equal to the cuberoot of the binomial quantity 1  ze or if the numeral coefficients of the said latter series be denoted by the capital letters A B C D E F G H c respectively so that A shall be  1 B  13 C  19 D  581 E  10243 F  22729 G  1546561 and H  2618137781 and so on the said numeral co efficients 29 20243 3086561 c will be equal to 2C 2E 2G C and the series mentioned in the last Article will be 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c and consequently the root of the equation x3  qx  r in the second case of it in which rr4 is less than q327 will be equal to the expression 3 e x the series 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c ART 5 Now the series 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c is88 Appendix to a Method of extending is equal to the sum of the two following serieses to wit 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c in which all the terms fol lowing the first term are marked with the sign  or are subtracted from the first term and 4Czzee  4Gz6e6  c and the series 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c is equal to the sum of the two serieses A  Bze  Czzee  Dz3e3  Ez4e4    Gz6e6  c and A  Bze  Czzee  Dz3e3  Fz5e5  Gz6e6  c which are respectively equal to the cuberoots of the binomial quantities 1  ze and 1  ze Therefore the series 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c is  3 1  ze  3 1  ze  the infinite series 4Czzee  4Gz6e6  c Consequently the expression 3 e x the series 2A  2Czzee  2Ez4e4  2Gz6e6  c is  3e x 3 1  ze  3e x 3

both this mixed expression of the root of the equation x3 qx  r in the second case of it and the merely transcendental expression of it published in the former paper and from which this expression is derived were invented by Monsieur NICOLE and published in the memoirs of the French Academy of Sciences so long ago as the year 1738 and the latter of them to wit the transcendental expression 3 e x the series 2  2ss9ee  20s4243e4  308s66561e6  c I had myself seen many years ago in Monsieur CLAIRAUTS algebra in the place cited in the 50th Article of my former paper to wit in pages 286 287 288 But it was obtained by the intervention of negative quantities and the roots of negative quantities which gave it in my opinion an air of great obscurity And therefore I thought an investigation of the same series by a method that keeps clear of those difficulties might not be unacceptable to the lovers of these sciences nor unworthy of a place in the Transactions of this learned body VOL LXX N to90

 3 e  z  4  3 e X the series Czzee  Gz6e6  Lz10e10  Pz14e  Tz18e  c given in Art 5 A R T 9 Let it be required to resolve the equation x3  x  13 by means of the said expression Here q is  1 and r  13 and consequently q3 is  1 and q327  127 and r2  16 and rr4  136 which is less than 127 or q327 Therefore this equation does not come under CARDANS rule but may be resolved by the expression given in Art 5 provided that rr4 though less than q327 is greater than half q327 or than q354 which it is because 3 itCARDANS Rule to the second Case c 93 it is  136 whereas q354 is equal only to 154 which is less than 136 Therefore the proposed equation x3  x  13 may be resolved by means of the said expression ART 10 Now since in this case q is  1 and r is  13 we shall have r2 or e   and q327  rr4  127  136  4108  3108  1108  136 x 3 that is zz will be  136 x 3 and consequently z will be  16 3 Therefore e  z will be  16  16  3   36  3  16  3  36 x 3   36 x 3  3   36 x 3  3   318  3  1732050818

and consequently  3 e  z   3 e  z is 64060791 41299340 1 05360131 ART II It remains that we compute the infinite series Czzee  Gz6e6  Lz10e10  Pz14e14  Tz16e16  c and extract the cube root of e and then multiply the said series into 4 times the said cuberoot Now the cuberoot of e is in this case   3 16  136  11817121 and consequently 4  3 e is  41817121 And94 Appendix to a Method of extending

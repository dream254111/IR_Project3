are furnished no good would come of it The establishing and maintaining the force necessary for the due supervision and control under a national law of such adulterated foods should be suitably provided for and the rules and regulations for their guidance should be vested in some responsible bureau officer with the approval of the Secretary of the Department This force should be divided into two classes 1 The in spectors who would be assigned to certain districts and should visit all manufactories of food products including slaughterhouses and dairies and the places of all dealers where articles of food intended for consumption are sold displayed or stored procuring by purchase or otherwise samples for inspection or analysis They should have the necessary police authority to detain seize or destroy adul terated articles of food wherever found as now vested in most municipal sanitary police officers 2 The analysts under the control of a chief would be required to make the necessary chemical and physical examinations of the samples of food collected by the inspectors or submitted under suita ble regulations by other parties The duly verified certifi cate of an analyst stating that the examination of the sample submitted shows it to be adulterated within the meaning of the act shall be received as evidence of the fact in any pro ceedings taken against any person for violation of the law The defendant however shall have the right to require the attendance of the analyst for the purpose of crossexamination Standards of strength quality or purity of different foods shall be fixed from time to time and prescribed by the Secre tary of the Department for the guidance of the analysts Where samples of food products are received from the public at large they should be accompanied with an affidavit stating the facts in the case and a small fee for the analysis of the same should be paid in advance The inspection of meat fish vegetables fruit and especially milk should be done daily in any large city and properly belongs to the health department of such city If such a law should take the form of a revenue measure many provisions of existing laws in regard to special taxes stamps brands returns notices etc could be made to apply and very little increase in the force of the Internal Revenue Bureau would be needed If the manufacturers of adulterated goods paid special taxes at the rate of one dollar per month wholesale dealers fifty cents per month and retail dealers twenty cents for the same time and a tax of one mill per pound were collected on every article of food adulterated within the meaning of the act the revenue thus derived would not much more than cover the expense of enforcing such a law EDGAR RICHARDS NOTES AND NEWS AN ingenious contrivance has been recently adopted at the Hippodrome in Paris with a view to producing scenic effects in the central oval space without the spectators opposite being seen atthe same time Nature describes the contrivance as an ellipti cal screen of fine steel netting which is let down in comparative darkness so as to be about twelve feet in front of the benches This is painted on the inner side with a representation of the Place du Vieux March6 at Rouen the piece being  Jeanne dArc and VOL XVI No 394 as it is strongly illuminated at a given moment from the centre the light outside being

July 12 He had been retired from business many years so that his death will have no effect on the Philadelphia firm  In his recent thesis on the influence of the seashore on leaves M Pierre Lesage shows by conclusive evidence says Nature that a marine habitat leads to a thickening of the leaves The palis sadecells are more numerous and larger than in the leaves of the same plants grown inland Apparently the seasalt is the cause of this alteration as plants cultivated in artificially salted soil yield thicker leaves The observations of M Lesage bear on some ninety species of plants which are in their natural state found near the sea in Brittany as well as inland Professor Thomas F Hunt Assistant Agriculturist of the Illinois Experiment Station reports a comparative feeding test between corn fodder and corn silage the results of which are slightly in favor of the dry cured fodder While the results of the experiments are somewhat contradictory those which bear evi dence of the greatest thoroughness agree in indicating that there is practically no difference between the feeding values of a given quantity of corn cured as ensilage and an equivalent quantity cured as dry fodder provided equally good husbandry has been practised in both cases Whether corn may be cured and pre served more economically by the one process or the other depends largely upon local circumstances and seasonal peculiarities  Commenting on an article on the influence of the moon on weather by Dr G Meyer Nature says that although such inves tigations have hitherto given a negative result the author thought that with the materials furnished by synoptic charts he might eliminate local influences and he gives tables extending over a number of years which seem to show the influence of the moon in lowering the height of the barometer in the months of Septem ber to January at the time of full moon and in raising it during the first quarter The Deutsche Seewarte which communicates the article points out that a similar result has been independently arrived at by Captain Seemann one of the assistants of the in stitution The same effect or any other is not perceptible in other months  The following facts quoted by Nature from its French name sake La Nature relate to exceptional seasons in past centuries They were collected by M Villard of Valence for France espe cially and for Europe generally In 1282 the winter was so mild that cornflowers were sold in Paris in February New wine was also drunk at Li6ge on Aug 24 In 1408 the winter was so severe that nearly all the Paris bridges were carried away by the ice Ink froze in the pen although a fire was in the room A similar fact is quoted by Dove as occurring at Sebastopol on Dec 13 18551 All the sea between Norway and Denmark was frozen The summers of 1473 and 1474 were disastrously hot In the winter of 154445 wine was frozen in barrels all over France It was cut with hatchets and sold by the pound In 157273 nearly all the rivers were frozen The Rhone was traversed by carriages at various places In 1585 the winter was very mild corn was in ear at Easter but the third week in May was extremely cold The Belgian Legation at Mexico has recently reported to the Belgian Government on the subject of guimbobo known also as  angu which is found in the State of Vera Cruz a plant which should be included in the catagory of all the varieties of Mexican textiles An American specialist has been appointed to examine and report upon the fibreproducing qualities of this plant This gentleman has discovered that the guimbobo pro duces not only a fibre of very superior quality but that it can be easily and cheaply cultivated moreover the fruit of the plant constitutes a nutritious food According to the Journal of the Society of Arts it appears from experiments that have already been made that the guimbobo differs essentially from the ramie cotton and hemp as in the guimbobo the covering of the plant surrounds the fibre and is not mixed up and interlaced with itAUGUST 22 I890 SCIENCE this constitutes a decided economy added to great facility in ex material allowing it to remain longer in suspension in water traction and utilization The structure of the plant permits of the But the use of London purple upon the peach has often resulted operations of separating and removing the bark being performed in great injury to the foliage and sometimes to the young shoots by machinery while in the other fibrous plants these operations The injuries in the Michigan peach orchards last year led Pro must be effected by hand a system at the same time very costly fessor Cook of the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station to and only possible in countries where there is a large number of

that he could construct a machine costing no more than the London purple is more injurious to foliage than is Paris green and ordinary machines used for cotton and which could be used in that this is doubtless owing to the soluble arsenic which is quite the same manner By this machine the fibre could be extracted abundant in London purple and almost absent in Paris green and sold by the pound in the same way as cotton Persons cul The colored liquid left after the complete settling of the London tivating this plant would benefit in addition by the sale of the purple was destructive to peach foliage It appeared that greater fruit which is much esteemed in the temperate and tropical injury occurred when the spraying was performed shortly before countries of the South where the guimbobo

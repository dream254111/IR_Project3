drew his own will After dating and signing it he added whether at the time of signing or thereafter does not appear the following statement Be it fdrther known that all these sharers are to receive their shares pro rata in case part of the estate cannot be collected from those people who now owe this estate    The will contained besides two devises of realty four general money legacies a void legacy to a church and three specific legacies of personalty The personal estate was insufficient to make all payments provided for under the will Held that the auditor correctly paid the specific legacies in full abating only the general money legacies because of the deficiency Calvins Estate I908 35 Pa Co Ct 545 It is undoubtedly a general rule of distribution that in case an estate proves sufficient to pay all debts and all specific legacies but not the general legacies the latter are subject to abatement in equal proportion 2 WIL LIAMS EXECUTORS I2II 7th Am Ed p 66I I ROPER LEGACIES 355 356 Moores Estate I897 I9 Pa Co Ct R 459 Whether or not this established rule of distribution must yield to the intent of the testator ex pressed in his will is the question here involved Undoubtedly the trend of modern decisions is to give effect to the intention of the testator where such is apparent and unquestioneda proposition so well recognized in Pennsylvania and elsewhere as to make a citation of authority a needless formality In the principal case however the exact intent of the testator is not expressed in altogether unambiguous terms It is said in WILLIAMS EXECUTORS 1223 and in I ROPER LEGACIES 425 that where expressions intended to give priority are ambiguous and do not mark out with cer tainty the testators intention no priority is allowed In short where there is ambiguity the statutes of distribution take their course In the principal case the claim is that no priority was intended whereas under the statutes or common law there is priority However the principle laid down supra is as to the effect of the testators expression of intent not the result thereof The question was raised in the principal case by the testators next of kin along with other exceptions to the auditors findings Upon what ground the exceptants hoped to benefit does not appear for and as indeed the court points out no benefit could reach them in any event the question being of concern between only the general and specific legatees Properly raised by the general legatees a fuller consideration would undoubtedly have been accorded this exception indeed we are led to believe that a different decision might have been reached As a result while the courts decision under all the circumstances of the case evidences no glaring error of judgment we are naturally prone to wonder what construction might have been placed upon the testators statement and its effect upon the distribution had the general legatees been the exceptants WILLSREPUGNANCY IN A DEVISEINTENTION OF TESTATOR CONTROLS Testator devised to his wife her heirs and assigns forever the following realty    and it is my will that my said wife and her heirs shall hold 448RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS said land in fee simple forever or so long as she shall remain a widow There was no limitation over The wife subsequently married Held that the express limitation or so long as she shall remain a widow could not be rejected as repugnant to the preceding words of absolute devise and the wifes estate terminated upon her remarriage Haring v Shelton et al First Nat Bank of Crockett Intervener I9o8  Tex Civ App  114 S W 389 The tendency of the later American decisions upon wills to reach such a finding as accords most clearly with the testators primary object in drawing the instrument is well illustrated by this case No general rule of the law of wills was more universally recognized at one time than that if a testator after giving an estate in fee proceeds to qualify the devise by a proviso or a condition    the condition is nugatory and the estate absolute 2 BIGELOWS JARMAN WILLS 854 More and more the courts are prone to disregard even such recognized rules of law as this and decide in con formity with the general scheme of the will The decision in the principal case is ably supported by reason and in the course of its well considered opinion the court says in part If the general intention of the testator can be collected from the whole will particular terms    inconsistent with that intention must be rejected as introduced by mistake or ignorance    as to the force of the words used in order that the paramount intent of the testator shall prevail He who runs may read in the testators unfortunate expression the intent that his widow should enjoy his property only for so long as she remained his widow Obviously it would defeat an undoubted desire to allow the widow in this case a fee simple absolute free from condition The right to so devise property as the testator here intended is well recognized A devise to a widow upon condition that she shall not remarry has been held not such a condition as is void because in restraint of marriage 2 BIGELOWS JARMAN WILLS 886 It is likewise an established doctrine of the law of wills that in a devise of realty a limitation over is not necessary to make a condition subsequent valid as is the case in a bequest of personalty upon condition 2 BIGELOWS JARMAN WILLS 887 Had the widow in the principal case died without remarrying another interesting question might have arisen namely whether she took a life estate or a fee simple absolute subject to her will or descendible to her heirs As the solution of this problem was unnecessary in the decision of the case the court did not take occasion to answer it Authorities cited however would indicate that the uniform view is that a devise to a widow during her widowhood is a devise of a mere life estate The application of this view would not result in what we might well suppose the intent of the testator actually was and we are led to speculate as to what this court with its liberal modern tendencies might have decided 449

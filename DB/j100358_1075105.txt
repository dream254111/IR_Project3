j100358,The School Review,1075105,The Educational Value of Examinations for Admission to College,i244551,THE EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS FOR ADMISSION TO COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS are presumably means to an end not an end in themselves Their value will be determined by the service they render in the attainment of the desired ends In school work the interested parties are the pupil who is entitled to make the most of himself the teacher whose professional reputation is at stake and the school or educational system which is supported directly or indirectly by the public for the public good There can be no doubt of the educational value of examina tions to those who conduct the examinations Our daily experience shows conclusively enough that success in life depends largely upon the critical acumen which precedes and influences judgment Perhaps this is one reason it is hardly becoming in me to make the suggestion why colleges cling so tenaciously to the privilege of examining candidates for admission But seriously it is good for a boy occasionally to have to pass formal examinations He may some day want to be a civil servanta policeman a streetsweeper or a teacher this is not intended to be an anticlimaxand then he will be required to come to terms with a list of questions and an exam ining board Moreover he will have frequent use in life for the ability to conceal his own ignorance And when we con sider in the words of Richard Baxter  how very little it is that we know in comparison to that we are ignorant of it will be seen that the ability to veneer this vast body of ignorance with a respectable coating of usable information is an accom plishment not lightly to be regarded It might also be men tioned in this appreciation of the educational value of examina tions for those who are examined that there is nothing more likely to take the conceit out of a fellow than a try at a paper A paper read before the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and Maryland at a meeting held in Baltimore November 28 1902 42EDUCA TIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS set by persons whom he doesnt know in a subject which he thinks he does know As a modern philosopher has remarked A reasonable amount of fleas is good for a dog they keep him fm broodin on bein a dog The topic assigned me as I understand it excludes the consideration of examinations given in the course of instruction for the purpose of making that instruction more efficient Such tests as written recitations quizzes term and final examinations and the like are of the greatest value to the teacher who is really concerned in educating his pupils These examinations are indispensable they need no argument to justify the position they hold in our scheme of instruction But examinations con ducted by outside authorities are in another category They too may have a place and be valuable but the justification must come from some other source From the standpoint of the pupil examinations conducted by persons outside the school are far and away more harmful than helpful I grant that they do tend to keep lazy boys up to the scratch to show the conceited how little they know to train the nervous and scatterbrained to hold themselves in and do something on time in short they do help a boy to pull himself together and concentrate himself on a task which requires all strength and ingenuity But what is it all worth in comparison with the attendant evils The tendency to substitute for high ideals in scholarship a mere caricature of learning to put for ward a mechanical process as the summum bonum of the school course to replace clear thinking by guesswork to regard the examiner as a person to be satisfied at any costhonestly if possible dishonestly if necessary Any scheme that puts a premium on success at a particular time or under peculiar con ditions strains the moral fiber It is certainly good for moral fiber to withstand a strain but when for sake of reward or fear of failure the strain becomes unendurable the result is altogether bad The recent experience of an eastern preparatory school is by no means exceptional save in the extent of the fault and the publicity given to it The relation between candidate and examiner does not promote high moral standards witness the 43THE SCHOOL REVIEW need of proctors and the unwillingness of boys even college students to assume the moral responsibility of taking examina tions without watchers The overseers of a New England Col lege Tufts have recently published the following criticism of prevailing student customs It is well understood that the student body in most colleges has always sanctioned a highly artificial code of morals which thoughtful men would repudiate at once in the domain of business or of society This peculiar code which tolerates cheating in examinations justifies the destruction of private property in the celebration of athletic victories encourages boorish manners and various forms of reprehensible conduct and causes strained relations between professors and students was perhaps a natural outgrowth of the inflexible curriculum and the paternal form of college government which prevailed until comparatively recent years The situation is a relic of that educational barbarism which assumed no honesty in the scholar and no sympathy in the master On this point therefore let there be no misunderstanding To the boy who is examined by outside authorities for the sake of personalgain there can be no benefit worth mentioning which cannot be secured equally well in some less reprehensible way but on the contrary the process tends to lower our intellectual and moral standards a fact which through long familiarity we have come to minimize or to entirely disregard But as I have said there is a place for examinations and in that place they have a distinct value Outside examinations are imperative whenever the secondary schools are unable or unwilling to assume the responsibility of meeting the requirements for admission to colleges and universities If good work is to be done in our col leges and professional schools a suitable foundation must be laid in the field of secondary education If the secondary schools will not or cannot assure the strength of that foundation then it is imperative that the higher institutions impose their own tests Weak schools of course may be left out of consideration But why it may be asked should any secondary school refuse to certify to the strength of its candidates if it is capable of doing so  Several reasons at once suggest themselves lack of knowledge of what the higher education really demands modesty 44EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS in proclaiming ones own belief unwillingness to be tacitly responsible for work over which one has no control inability to withstand the importunity of ambitious parents adherence to collegiate customs and so on through a long catalogue We have all heard them many times and in many forms varying from the modest excuse to the utterly imbecile apology So trivial do some of the reasons seem and so out of har mony with the character of the men who put them forth that I have concluded to look deeper for the true cause of the apparent unwillingness of certain secondaryschool masters to stand spon sor for their scholars When the principal of a large high school tells me that he has more important work to do than to satisfy the crotchets of some college professor I can see an obvious reason for his position but when the master of a school avow edly preparatory to college and well assured of its patronage tells me that he prefers outside judgment as to who of his pupils shall go to college I am at a loss to understand his meaning without appeal to first principles The great public schools of England Eton Harrow Rugby and the resthave long been ideal fitting schools Their ideal is I need hardly say out and out English it is not French it is not German it is not American but it is a type which finds sympathy and support everywhere An Englishman high in the councils of the government has recently said We have never made an idol of intellectual instruction imparted in day schools In other words our great educators have upheld the belief though we are far from having lived up to all that the belief implies that a school ought to be something higher than a knowledge factory that what a man is matters a great deal more than what he knows That wise actions involve many vital elements besides intellectual attainments and that education in the true sense of the word is an atmosphere and a discipline affecting heart and mind and body and neglecting none of the three Again he says  We are in the habit of liking our national life to be so arranged as to allow as much freedom as possible for every gifted individual to express himself according to his inborn faculty This means that we prefer untidy DR SADLER Special Reports Vol IX p 9 2 P 501 45THHE SCHOOL REVIE W freedom to an immaculately neat system of restraints We resent the idea of pressing boys or girls to learn a great deal at school We believe in the value of a good deal of wellemployed idleness during early years In other words the master has much more to do in school than to give instruction and for the boy there is a larger and more important life than the life of the classroom Kipling portrays that life most admirably in The Brushwood Boy Ten years in an English school do not encourage dreaming Georgie won his growth and chest measurement and a few other things which did not appear on the bills under a system of cricket football and paper chases from four to five days a week which provided for three lawful cuts of a groundash if any boy absented himself from these entertainments  At last he blossomed into full glory as head of the school ex officio captain of the games head of his house where he and his lieutenants preserved disci pline and decency among seventy boys from twelve to seventeen general arbiter in the quarrels which spring up among the touchy Sixth and intimate friend and ally of the Head himself  Above all he was responsible for that thing called the tone of the school and few realize with what passion ate devotion a certain type of boy throws himself into this work Home was a faraway country full of ponies and fishing and shooting and menvisitors who interfered with ones plans but school was the real world where things of vital importance happened and crises arose that must be dealt with promptly and quietly  and Georgie was glad to be back in authority when the holidays ended Behind him but not too near was the wise and temperate Head now suggesting the wisdom of the serpent now counseling the mildness of the dove leading him on to see more by halfhints than by any direct word how boys and men are all of a piece and how he who can handle the one will assuredly in time control the other For the rest the school was not encouraged to dwell on its emotions but rather to keep in hard condition to avoid false quantities and to enter the army direct without the help of the expensive London crammer under whose roof young blood learns too much Cottar major went the way of hundreds before him The Head gave him six months final polish taught him what kind of answers best please a certain kind of examiners and handed him over to the properly constituted authorities who passed him into Sandhurst He did not know that he bore with him from school and college a character worth much fine gold but was pleased to find his mess so kindly He had plenty of money of his own his training had set the publicschool mask upon his face and had taught him how many were the things no fellow can do By virtue of the same training he kept his pores open and his mouth shut This little sketch of Kiplings is I believe the best portrait of the English public school in existence He puts duty com 46EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS mon sense character in the foreground as the great ends to be desired in education Hence his Praise of Famous Men And we all praise famous men Ancients of the college For they taught us common sense Tried to teach us common sense Truth and Gods Own Common Sense Which is more than knowledge This we learned from famous men Knowing not its uses When they showed in daily work Man must finish off his work  Right or wrong his daily work And without excuses This we learned from famous men Teaching in our borders Who declared it was the best Safest easiest and the best Expeditious wise and best To obey your orders This we learned from famous men Knowing not we learned it Only as the years went by Lonely as the years went by Far from help as the years went by Plainer we discerned it Wherefore praise we famous men From whose bays we borrow They that put aside Today All the joys of their Today And with toil of their Today Bought for us Tomorrow Such an ideal of education as this demands indeed famous men as teachers They are men who cannot be harnessed to a system or hampered by restraints The master is the school and because masters differ the schools will not conform to an accepted norm A few succeed others overreach themselves and are lamentable failures Under such a system intellectual attain ment ranks as one aim among many and it is conceivable that it may not always be the most important one Strength of char 477THE SCHOOL REVIEW acter honesty integrity physical prowess the ability to lead ones fellows cannot be relegated to second rank in any system of education Moreover the intimacy between master and scholar in a good home schoolan intimacy which in the course of years ripens into an affection that is akin to parental lovemakes it extremely difficult for the teacher to judge the boy from one standpoint only He knows him too well his faults and his virtues are spread before him in an open book To single out one attainment on which to predict the future is to neglect others which will surely tell as time goes on How can the master under such conditions be a righteous judge So it happens that in such a system of education examinations con ducted by higher authorities come easily and naturally to be the culmination of the school course Say what we will about the English school system we Ameri cans do believe in the best ideals of English education There is something in Tom Browns School Days which thrills us as schoolmasters even more than when we were schoolboys We are ready to say and we generally mean it that what a man is is of far more consequence than what he knows We believe that the making of man is the chief end of school work and we are not unwilling to borrow methods from those who seem to be successful in making a certain type of Englishman But notwithstanding our admiration for some things in Eng lish education we cannot accept all that the system implies class distinctions boarding schools for those who are to be leaders in Church and State day schools of an inferior sort for the masses separation of the sexes whenever possible inter ference of a state church low ideals of scholarship Some of those we regard not so much a fault of English education as of English life but bad teaching is certainly the work of poor teachers It has been remarked that in judging a teacher the German asks What does he know the American What can he do the Englishman Is he a good fellow Dr Sadler whose office in England corresponds to that of Dr Harris in this country says on this point 3 3Special Reports Vol IX pp Io II 48EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS No schoolmasters in the world lavish more time and thought and strength on the care of their pupils than the English secondary schoolmasters On what may be called the pastoral side of their office they are beyond rivalry  But because the English secondary schoolmaster so often lives among his pupils from morning to night he has far less time and strength to spare for professional studies than has his continental counterpart He is much more the friend of his pupils and much fresher in his sympathies with the interests of young people But he is far less of a student as a rule is much less learned and is often a hardened amateur in his methods of teaching  Clumsy antiquated methods of instruction are far too common in our secondary schools For the remedy he points his countrymen to Germany and extols German scholarship and German thoroughness The Germans have succeeded in getting a much larger proportion of their people to go through an advanced course of instruction than is the case in England  They have managed to inculcate scientific habits of mind and a disposition towards intellectual organization and cooperation to a degree quite unparalleled here  They have skilfully applied educa tion as an instrument in furthering their commercial and industrial interests  We shall find ourselves virtually compelled by their action to replace much of our old educational machinery by something which works more economically and turns out a more modern fabric  The strength of German education lies in its great tradition of disinterested devotion to knowledge in the selfsacrificing labours of the teachers  and in the infinite capacity for taking pains which whether innate or the result of a long tradition of educational discipline is characteristic of so many Ger man minds The German schools he points out2 could never have become what they are today had it not been for the high intel lectual qualifications of the teachers and for the care taken to weed out those who are lacking in professional aptitude for the work of teaching It is for an intellectual tradition as persis tent and congenial as the ethical tradition which characterizes the best English education that Dr Sadler pleads3 The development of individual intelligence is largely a question of methods of teaching but also of choice of studies Educational efficiency of the best kind depends on having small classes highly trained teachers skilful methods of teaching not too many subjects  the right order of sub jects the right choice of subjects and the avoidance of hurry of excessive competition and of intellectual overstrain  The keen study of methods SpecialReports Vol IX p 55 Ibid p 71 3Ibid pp 163 I64 49THE SCHOOL REVIEW by teachers is one of the best signs of educational progress But the aim should be not to enable the pupil to win a prize or a scholarship by a certain time or to pass in some competitive examination though I am far from meaning to imply that all competition is bad or that all examinations could be dispensed with but to start him in the right way of learning things for himself to arouse his interest in important subjects and to give him a sure foundation of accurate and welldirected knowledge Large numbers of our secondary schools are worried by a superfluity of examinations It would be far better to have some welldefined intellectual aim for each school and to allow the teachers to work steadily and quietly toward that aim I have quoted thus at length from a high English authority to show how conscious some Englishmen are of the great defects in English education His verdict is in a word I low ideals of scholarship and 2 bad teaching Both lead naturally and inevitably to the curse of examinations systematized and con ducted by authority of the state or university Little wonder that the Englishman in seeking for light should turn to Germany German education is strong precisely where English education is weak The one system lacks just what the other can give All the world knows what German universities stand for investigation research pure scholarship But the German secondary school is the foundation upon which the German university stands It has its own intellectual tradi tions and points to a long line of scholarly schoolmasters the finest classroom teachers in the world Here are blended the scholarly attainments and skill in teaching which the English man and the American must admire and ought to covet No lecturing or hearing recitations in a German school  the teacher is there to instruct And instruction means to the pupil the acquisition of useful informationknowledge systematized and directed toward some end which is itself worthy of attainment Hence the German teacher points out the way the pupil follows his instructions confidently knowing that there is no better way The work in class day by day is not guesswork there is no dawdling over lessons out of school no juggling with problems in mathematics or thumbing of lexicons to make sense out of a foreignlanguage exercise The teacher has a purpose and that purpose is to see to it that his pupils learn what for the time being is most important for them to know 50EDUCA TIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINA TIONS With teachers who know what to teach and how and when to teach it there is no need for outside examinations to decide the matter of promotion or graduation At the end of each year the class teachers in a German secondary school determine who in their opinion are qualified to do the work of the next higher class and at the end of the course candidates for the university are passed on or held back by verdict of the teachers of the highest class There is a final examination to be sure con ducted under the supervision of a state official but the ques tions are set by the teachers of the candidates on the work of the preceding year and the results are weighed and estimated by these same teachers But so nicely is part adjusted to part in this great system that there is likely to be no greater varia tion in the attainments of boys coming up to the universities from different schools than of those coming from any particular school Say what we will of the German school system of its inflexi bility its subserviency to state control its military character we Americans do admire its adherence to high ideals of scholar ship its appreciation of the teachers profession and its success in methods of teaching We recognize that it is a piece of finely adjusted machinery and that in the attainment of German aims better means could hardly be devised We have shown our appreciation in enduring forms Andrew D White says that intellectually Germany is the second mother of the United States4 More than any other country Germany has made the universities and technical high schools of America what they now area powerful force in the development of American civilization It is German influence too working in the realm of higher education which has propounded to the secondary schools some of the most vexing questions of the past decade We Americans are as Mr Kipling puts it mixed peoples with all the vices of men and boys combined But along with the vices go virtues which our schoolmasters steadily keep to the front We may be ethically English intellectually German but we are naturally if accidentally American We believe in 4 London Times December I 1900 51THE SCHOOL REVIEW the doctrine of equal opportunity for all men and for every boy and girl who can use it we believe it an educational ladder reaching from the kindergarten to the university That ideal at least is not English and it is certainly not German We believe in helping each pupil to make the most of his opportunities and to become that which he wishes to be providing his aim is not too obviously harmful to his fellows We set up no barriers social or otherwise to hamper his progress and we never regard his career as ended until he is safely underground There is no culmination in American life short of death itself Our school system therefore if it is to fit for American life can have no bounds We have no right to speak of the culmination of a school course unless we mean thereby in college parlance a commencement And least of all should we think of examina tions as the culmination of anything educational Let us reason together about this thingthis relic of educa tional barbarism It comes to us with the English stamp not yet effaced it bespeaks a tradition of poor scholarship and bad teach ing It is enforced by institutions which are more than half  made in Germany but which are complacent enough to suppose that German scholarship can be erected on a secondary education the sole guarantee of which is an examination for college entrance or in lieu thereof as was once remarked in a meeting of this association the good looks of the candidate Is it not more reasonable to suppose that when we succeed in evolving an American system of educationreally American I mean not a mere cross or hybridit will be a unity  a system neces sarily made up of constituent parts but so nicely adjusted that part will work with part in organic unison  When that time comes I venture to predict we shall hear nothing of examination for admission to any grade or to any school but much will be said of examinations for instruction and promotion The ele mentary school will pass on its pupils into the secondary school and the secondary school will admit them to college if that be their proper aim Or more properly speaking scholars who are let out of one grade or school will admit themselves to the grade or school next higher  Already we hear it said that graduates 52EDUCATIONAL VALUE OF EXAMINATIONS of any good fouryear highschool course should find a college course open to them I accept the statement and should be glad to add to it these wordswithout examination by college authorities But before these words can be added the American public must see to it that the highschool course is really good and that the teachers in point of character scholarship and profes sional ability are really worthy of the positions they occupy and of the hire which they ought to have In the meantime it is our duty to be righteously discontent with our present schemes of state inspection regents examinations college entrance boards and the like knowing them all to be dispensations of Providence calculated to keep us humble and fit us for a more blessed state The millenium is not yet in sight but the advance made in recent years in the matter of uniform entrance require ments and especially in the establishment of the College Entrance Board is most gratifying But while we are waiting let us be honest enough to confess that all these examination schemes are devices as some say to impress upon a doubting world the great importance of certain indispensable institutions of higher learning or the acknowledgment as others declare of the short comings of American secondary schools and the incapacity of American secondary schoolmasters To sum up Examinations must have a place in every scheme of instruction Instruction can proceed only when the extent and quality of the learners knowledge is definitely understood Every recitation every review is such an examination further examinations of a formal sort are often desirable for the sake both of the teacher and of the pupil But such examinations are given by teachers within the school or school system and primarily for the purpose of instruction Examinations by those outside the school especially when given for the purpose of determining a pupils ability to undertake an entirely new course of instruction have no educational value for the pupil which cannot be secured equally well in some less reprehensible way Such examinations however are practically necessary when intellectual attainment is not the only aim of school instruction 53THE SCHOOL REVIEW and both necessary and inevitable when that instruction is inefficient Outside examinations are imperative whenever the secondary schools are unable or unwilling to assume the responsibility of meeting the requirements for admission to col leges and universities Until a norm of secondary instruction is established and generally recognized college entrance examin ations cannot be dispensed with The sole object of this paper is to show that such examinations have no especial educational value for those who are examined they do have a distinct value in our school system and must be retained until some better plan is found for keeping weak schools up to grade and for the elimination of bad teaching The scheme of college entrance examinations is altogether a matter of temporary expediency It tests merely the candidates store of learning and to some extent his ability to use that learning it does not measure his intellectual desires his moral strength or his aesthetic taste Meanwhile it is our duty to find some way of assuring the intel lectual ability which students must have on admission to college and at the same time of encouraging the preparatory schools to emphasize in their course of training the manly virtues and the liberal culture which all men need in life JAMES E

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108340,ON THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERIC TIDE AT ST HELENA,I207002, 45  V ON THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERIC TIDE AT ST HELENA BY LIEUTCOLONEL EDWARD SABINE RA FOR SEC RS RECEIVED DECEMBER 16 1846READ JANUARY 28 1847 THE ATTRACTIONS OF THE SUN AND MOON OCCASION TIDES IN THE ATMOSPHERE SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE OCEAN THE EFFECTS ARE HOWEVER SO INCONSIDERABLE IN COMPARISON WITH THE DISTURBANCES PRODUCED IN THE EQUILIBRIUM OF THE ATMOSPHERE BY OTHER CAUSES THAT HITHERTO OBSERVATION HAS NOT SUCCEEDED IN AFFORDING ANY CLEAR OR DECISIVE EVIDENCE OF THEM THE PHENOMENON HOWEVER HAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE PHILOSOPHICAL INTEREST AS A FARTHER EXEMPLIFICATION OF THE UNIVERSALITY OF THE PRINCIPLE OF GRAVITATION AS THE EBB AND FLOW OF THE ATMOSPHERIC TIDE MUST BE GREATEST IN THE VICINITY OF THE EQUATOR AND AS MOREOVER THE ORDINARY EQUILIBRIUM IS LESS DISTURBED BY IRREGULAR CAUSES IN THAT REGION OF THE GLOBE THAN IN THE TEMPERATE ZONES IT WAS REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT THE EXISTENCE OF A TIDE IN THE ATMOSPHERE DEPENDING ON THE POSITION OF THE SUN OR MOON RELATIVELY TO THE MERIDIAN OF THE PLACE WOULD BE SHOWN IF AT ALL BY OBSERVATIONS MADE WITHIN THE TROPICS AND THAT THE MOST FAVOURABLE SITUATION FOR SUCH OBSERVATIONS MIGHT BE THAT OF A SMALL ISLAND SURROUNDED BY A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT OF OCEAN AND THEREFORE COMPARATIVELY FREE FROM THE ATMOSPHERIC DISTURBANCES OCCASIONED BY VARIATIONS OF THE TERRESTRIAL SURFACE AND WHERE ALSO THE TIDES OF THE OCEAN SHOULD BE SMALL THE IMPORTANCE OF ST HELENA AS A STATION OF OBSERVATION FOR THIS PURPOSE EARLY ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF THE HIGHLY INTELLIGENT DIRECTOR OF ITS MAGNETICAL AND METEO ROLOGICAL OBSERVATORY CAPTAIN LEFROY OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY AS MAY BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT OF A REPORT RECEIVED FROM THAT OFFICER DATED JUNE 1ST 1842 1 BELIEVE THAT NO OBSERVATIONS HAVE AS YET DECIDED THE QUESTION WHETHER ANY EFFECT UPON THE MEAN BAROMETRICAL PRESSURE IS PRODUCED BY THE MOONS DAILY PASSAGE OF THE MERIDIAN THE EXISTENCE OF AN ATMOSPHERIC TIDE OF THIS NATURE APPEARED HOW EVER SO INTERESTING A SUBJECT OF INQUIRY AND ITS DETECTION SO PROBABLE OWING TO THE EXTREME UNIFORMITY OF THE DAILY OSCILLATION THAT THE OBSERVATIONS OF SEVENTEEN MONTHS VIZ FROM AUGUST 1840 TO DECEMBER 1841 INCLUSIVE HAVE BEEN ARRANGED WITH THAT VIEW THE MODE ADOPTED WAS THISTHE CORRECTED HEIGHT OF THE BAROMETER I E THE READING REDUCED TO 320 FAHR AT THE HOUR OF OBSERVATION NEAREST THE MOONS MERIDIAN PASSAGE FOR EVERY DAY HAS BEEN ENTERED IN A CENTRAL COLUMNN AND IN PARALLEL COLUMNS HEADED 2H 4H C AND 211 4H C HAVE BEEN ENTERED THE OBSERVATIONS TAKEN RESPECTIVELY AT 2H 411 C BEFORE AND AFTER THE CENTRAL OBSERVATION A MEAN HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR THE OBSERVATIONS INCLUDED IN EACH LUNAR MONTH IT APPEARS FROM THELIEUTCOLONEL SABINE ON THE LUNAR SEVENTEEN MONTHS THUS EXAMINED THAT A MAXIMUM OF PRESSURE CORRESPONDS TO THE MOONS PASSAGE OVER BOTH THE INFERIOR AND SUPERIOR MERIDIANS BEING SLIGHTLY GREATER IN THE LATTER CASE AND THAT A MINIMUM CORRESPONDS NEARLY TO THE RISING AND SETTING OR TO  6H THE AVERAGE OF THE SEVENTEEN MONTHS GIVES THE RESPECTIVE PRESSURES AS FOLLOWS VIZ IN MOON ON THE MERIDIAN   282714 MOON IN THE HORIZON     282675 THE DIFFERENCE BEING 0039 IN  THE LATITUDE OF THE OBSERVATORY IS 15 57R THE HEIGHT ABOVE THE SEA ASCERTAINED BY LEVELLING 1764 FEET TO THE CISTERN OF THE BAROMETER OBSERVATIONS MADE IN 1827 UNDER THE DIRECTION OF MAJORGENERAL WALKER GAVE THE PARTICULARS OF THE OCEANIC TIDES AS FOLLOWS RISE AT NEW MOON   3 FEET 6 IN RISE AT FULL MOON   2 FEET 9 IN RISE AT THE QUARTERS   1 FOOT 5 IN ESTABLISHMENT   2 20M THERE APPEARS TO BE NO ESTABLISHMENT IN THE ATMOSPHERIC TIDE CONSEQUENTLY THE RISE IN THE OCEAN WILL NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIATION IN THE HEIGHT OF THE BAROMETER BECAUSE THE TIMES OF MAXIMUM DO NOT COINCIDE EARLY IN 1842 CAPTAIN LEFROY WAS SUCCEEDED IN THE CHARGE OF THE OBSERVATORY AT ST HELENA BY CAPTAIN SMYTHE OF THE ROYAL ARTILLERY AND FROM THE 1 ST OF OCTOBER OF THAT YEAR THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH UP TO THAT PERIOD HAD BEEN TAKEN AT EVERY SECOND HOUR OF MEAN SOLAR TIME WERE TAKEN AT EVERY HOUR AND THUS IN THEIR REARRANGEMENT IN LUNAR TIME THE MEAN HEIGHT OF THE BAROMETER AT THE DIFFERENT LUNAR HOURS BECAME BETTER REPRESENTED THAN HAD BEEN THE CASE UNDER THE TWOHOURLY SYSTEM DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF THE HOURLY OBSERVATIONS VIZ FROM OCTOBER 1842 TO SEPTEMBER 1843 IN CLUSIVE THE EXAMINATION OF THE MOONS INFLUENCE CONTINUED TO BE CARRIED ON AT THE OBSERVATORY BY CAPTAIN SMYTHE IN A SOMEWHAT MODIFIED MANNER WHICH IS THUS DE SCRIBED BY HIM  THE HOURLY OBSERVATIONS FOR EACH DAY EXTRACTED FROM THE DAY BOOK WERE GROUPED INTO LUNAR MONTHS AND THE MONTHLY MEAN FOR EACH HOUR FOUND THE OBSERVATION TAKEN EACH DAY AT THE HOUR NEAREST THE TIME OF THE MOONS MERIDIAN TRANSIT WAS INSERTED IN THE CENTRE COLUMN FOR THAT DAY AND THE OTHER OBSERVATIONS DIS POSED RIGHT AND LEFT IN ORDER AS HOWEVER THE OBSERVATIONS IN THIS STATE ARE AFFECTED BY THE DIURNAL VARIATION WHICH AT ST HELENA IS VERY REGULAR AND CONSIDERABLE AND BY WHICH THE MOONS EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN OVERRIDDEN THE MONTHLY MEAN FOR THE HOUR WAS SUBTRACTED FROM EACH OBSERVATION TAKEN AT THAT HOUR AND THE REMAINDER REGARDED AS DUE TO THE MOONS ACTION WHEN ONLY TWENTYTHREE OBSERVATIONS INTER VENED BETWEEN TWO MERIDIAN TRANSITS OFTH OON

CORRESPOND IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES TO THE LUNAR HOURS UNDER WHICH THE VALUE OF BB HAVE BEEN ARRANGED THE EFFECTS OF THIS IMPERFECT SYNCHRONISM HAVE A TENDENCY TO COMPENSATE EACH OTHER AND ARE PROBABLY NEARLY COMPENSATED AT ALL THE LUNAR HOURS EXCEPT AT 0 AND 12 6 AND 18 THESE HOWEVER ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT HOURS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE MAXIMUM EFFECT AND SUPPOSING THERE TO BE NO ESTABLISHMENT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT WHETHER THE OBSERVA TION PRECEDES OR WHETHER IT FOLLOWS THE PRECISE LUNAR HOUR TO WHICH IT SHOULD CORRE SPOND THE ERROR PRODUCED WILL BE THE SAME IN KIND VIZ THE MAXIMUM AT O1 AND 12H WILL BE LOWERED AND THE MINIMUM AT 6H AND 18H WILL BE RAISED AND IN BOTH CASES THE ERROR WILL TEND TO DIMINISH THE APPARENT INFLUENCE OF THE MOONS POSITION ON THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE IT MAY THEREFORE BE PRESUMED THAT THE TRUE HORARY VARIATION CORRESPONDING TO THE LUNAR HOURS IS IN EVERY CASE GREATER THAN THE NUMBERS WHICH APPEAR IN THE PRECEDING TABLE AND THAT THE HORARY VARIATION AT 011 AND 1211 WHICH SHOULD EXPRESS THE WHOLE DIFFERENCE OF PRESSURE CORRESPONDING TO THE MOONS POSITIONS ON THE MERIDIAN AND AT SIX HOURS DISTANCE FIOM IT IS ESPECIALLY LESS THAN THE TRUE AMOUNT BEING DIMINISHED BY THE CAUSES ABOVE MENTIONED BOTH AT THE HOURS WHEN THE MOON IS ON THE MERIDIAN AND WHEN SHE IS SIX HOURS DISTANT TO OBVIATE THIS IN CONVENIENCE AND TO GIVE THE RESULTS IN FUTURE AS MUCH PRECISION AS THEY ARE CAPABLE OF EIGHT ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS AT EQUAL LUNAR INTERVALS WILL HEREAFTER BE MADE IN EACH DAY CORRESPONDING PRECISELY TO THE LUNAR HOURS OF 0 3 6 9  21  AND TTHESE OBSERVATIONS WILL BE MADE ON SUNDAYS AS WELL AS ON OTHER DAYS WE MAY CONCLUDE THEREFORE AS THE RESULT OF THE TWO YEARS OF OBSERVATION FIROM OCTOBER 1843 TO SEPTEMBER 1845 INCLUSIVE THAT THE BAROMETER AT THE OBSERVATORY AT ST HELENA IS HIGHER WHEN THE MOON IS ON THE MERIDIAN EITHER ABOVE OR BELOW THE POLE THAN WHEN SHE IS SIX HOURS DISTANT FROM THE INERIDIAN BY AN AVERAGE QUANTITY WHICH EXCEEDS 00365 IN AND MAY BE TAKEN IN ROUND NUMBERS AS 004 IN FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXAMINING WHETHER ANY PERCEPTIBLE DIFFERENCE IN THE INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON THE BAROMETRIC PRESSURE COULD BE DETECTED AT THE PERIODS OF THE APOGEE AND PERIGEE THE FOLLOWING METHOD WAS ADOPTED THE EPOCH OF THE MOONS PERIGEE OR APOGEE BEING TAKEN FROM THE NAUTICAL ALMANAC THE NEAREST OF THE LUNAR HOURS 0 6 12 OR 18 TO THAT EPOCLH IS TAKEN AS THE MIDDLE TERM OF COMPARISON  IF IT BE 0 OR 12 HOURS THE VALUES OF BB AT THE FOUR ANTECEDENT AND FOUR SUBSEQUENT LUNAR MERIDIAN HOURS 0 AND 12 ARE TAKEN IN ADDITION TO THE MLIDDLE TERM TO GIVE A MNEAN VALUE CORRESPONDING TO THE TIMES WHEN THE MIOON IS ON THE MERIDIAN ABOVE OR BELOW THE POLE THE MEAN OF THE EIGHT INTERMEDIATE VALUES OF BB AT 6 AND 18 HOURS TAKEN IN LIKE MANNER FURNISHES A MNEAN VALUE CORRESPONDING TO THE TIMLES WHEN THE MNOON IS SIX HOURS DISTANT FRONI THE MERIDIAN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE MEAN VALUES OF BB GIVES FOR THE EPOCH IN QUESTION THE EXCESS OF THE BAROMETRICAL PRESSURE WHEN THE MOON IS ON THE MERIDIAN ABOVE THE PRESSURE WHEN SHE IS SIX HOURS DISTANT FROM IT THEORETICALLY THIS EXCESS SHOULD BE GREATER AT PERIODS OF PERIGEE THAN AT THOSE OF APOGEE MDCCCXLVII H 49ON THE LUNAR ATMOSPHERIC TIDE AT ST HELENA IF THE LUNAR HOUR NEAREST TO THE EPOCH OF APOGEE OR PERIGEE BE 6 OR 18 INSTEAD OF 0 OR 12 THAT HOUR IS TAKEN AS THE MIDDLE TERM OF COMPARISON AND THE MEAN VALUES OF B B CONSIST IN SUCH CASE OF THE MEAN OF NINE VALUES AT 6 AND 18 HOURS AND OF EIGHT AT 0 AND 12 WHEN A SUNDAY INTERVENES THE SAME NUMBER OF VALUES OF B VIZ EIGHT OF THE ONE AND NINE OF THE OTHER ARE TAKEN TO GIVE THE MEAN VALUE IN THE COMPARISON WHICH CONSEQUENTLY IN SUCH CASE EXTENDS TO A SOMEWHAT GREATER DISTANCE ON EITHER SIDE OF THE MIDDLE TERM THAN WHEN NO SUCH INTERRUPTION OCCURS THE MEAN EXCESS OF BAROMETRICAL PRESSURE WHEN THE MOON IS ON THE MERIDIAN RESULTING FROM THIS COMPARISON IS AS FOLLOWS FROM 13 EPOCHS OF PERIGEE BETWEEN OCTOBER 1843 AND SEPTEMBER 1844 00407 IN FROM 13 EPOCHS OF PERIGEE BETWEEN OCTOBER 1844 AND SEPTEMBER 1845 00394 IN FROM 13 EPOCHS OF APOGEE BETWEEN OCTOBER 1843 AND SEPTEMBER 1844 00341 IN FROM 14 EPOCHS OF APOGEE BETWEEN OCTOBER 1844 AND SEPTEMBER 1845 00347 IN THE NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS FIOMN WHICH EACH OF THE FIRST THREE RESULTS IS OBTAINED IS 221  IN THE FOURTH CASE IT IS 238 WE HAVE HERE IN BOTH YEARS A CONSISTENT INDICATION OF THE GREATER INFLUENCE OF THE MOON ON THE BAROMETRICAL PRESSURE AT PERIODS OF PERIGEE THAN AT THOSE OF APOGEE THE EFFECT OF THE SOLAR ACTION ON THE ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE IS FAR MORE DIFFICULT TO BE SHOWN BY ANY MODE OF GROUPING THE OBSERVATIONS THAN IS THAT OF THE MOON NOT ONLY BECAUSE IT IS MUCH SMALLER BUT BECAUSE IT IS MASKED IN THE DIURNAL BAROMETRIC OSCILLATION BY THE MUCH GREATER AND VARIABLE INFLUENCE OF THE SOLAR HEAT IN PRODUCING ATMOSPHERIC VARIATIONS THAT IT IS ELININATED IN COMMON WITH THE OTHER VARIATIONS WHICH DEPEND ON THE SUNS HORARY ANGLE BY THE PROCESS DESCRIBED IN THIS PAPER MAY BE INFERRED FROM THE FACT THAT NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE APPEARS IN COMPARING THE EXCESS IN THE VALUES OF BB AT THE LUNAR HOURS OF 0 AND 12 AT THE PERIODS OF SYZYGIES AND QUADRATURES DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS FROM OCTOBER 1843 TO SEPTEMBER 1844 INCLUSIVE THE MEAN VALUES IN THIS COMPARISON HAVE BEEN TAKEN FROM THE OBSERVATIONS AT OH AND 12 6 AND 18 FOR 36 HOURS PRECEDING AND 36 HOURS FOLLOWING THE EPOCH OF EACH SYZYGY AND QUADRATURE THE MEAN EXCESS AT 0 AND 12 AT THE PERIODS OF SYZYGY IS 00337 AND AT THOSE OF QUADRATURE 00345 THE QUANTITIES TREATED OF IN THIS COMMUNICATION WILL JUSTLY APPEAR TO MANY PERSONS AS EXTREMELY SMALL BUT THE CONSISTENCY OF THE PARTIAL RESULTS WHEN THE OBSERVATIONS ARE BROKEN INTO PERIODS OF SIX MONTHS PLACES BEYOND DOUBT THE POWER OF OBSERVATION IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUTNSTANCES AND CONTINUED FOR A SUFFICIENT TIME TO DETERMINE BOTH THE EXISTENCE AND THE APPROXIMATE AMOUNT OF A DIURNAL SYSTEMATIC AFFECTION OF THE BAROMETER NOT EXCEEDING FOUR THOUSANDTHS OF AN INCH IT ALSO AFFORDS AN INSTRUCTIVE EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFICIAL INFLUENCE OF MEAN NUMERICAL VALUES IN THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES AND OF THE POWER WHICH WE POSSESS THROUGH THEIR MEANS OF PROGRESSIVELY SEPARATING FIOMN APPARENTLY IRREGULAR PHENOMENA THAT WHICH IS CONSTANT AND REDUCIBLE TO LAWS 50

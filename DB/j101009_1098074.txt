IS NOT POS SIBLE TO READ THE DEED IN THIS CASE AND NOT SEE THAT ALL ITS PROVISIONS WERE SOLELY INTENDED TO REALIZE THE GREATEST AMOUNT FROM THE TRUST SUBJECT FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE CREDITORS AND WERE NOT DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE DEBTOR THE SAME PRINCIPLE WAS AFFIRMED IN WILLIAMS V LORD  ROBINSON 75 VA 401 SEE ALSO CATT TRUSTEE V KNABE MAN CO 93 VA 740 THE FACT THAT THE TRUSTEE ELECTED TO CARRY ON THE BUSINESS FOR THE LIMITED PERIOD PRESCRIBED BY THE DEED DID NOT INVALIDATE IT THE RIGHT TO DO SO IF IN HIS JUDGMENT WISE WAS CLEARLY CONFERRED UPON HIM AND AS SEEN ABOVE SUCH A PROVISION IS NOT ILLEGAL NOR DOES THE FURTHER FACT THAT THE TRUSTEE EMPLOYED THE DEBTOR AS HIS CHIEF SALESMAN TO DISPOSE OF THE STOCK OF MERCHANDISE DO SO THE DEED OF TRUST IMPOSED ON THE TRUSTEE NO OBLIGATION TO

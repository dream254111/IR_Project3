j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098074,Hurst  Co v Leckie Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond November 16 1899,i245867,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER debt If it were held otherwise any trader doing business under a general merchants license apparently on his own account could fill his storeroom with consigned goods create the impression that he was the owner obtain credit upon the faith thereof and when his creditors demanded payment make known for the first time that the goods were not his and thus he and those who had entrusted him with their goods could perpetrate a fraud upon his creditors To prevent just such frauds was one of the objects of the statute The judgment complained of is erroneous in so far as it held that the property claimed by the Smith  Barnes Piano Company the Newman Bros Company and the First National Bank was not liable to the plaintiffs debt and to that extent it must be reversed and this court will enter such judgment as the Circuit Court ought to have entered Reversed HURST  CO V LECKIE Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond November 16 1899 Absent Keith P 1 ASSIGNMENT FOR BENEFIT OF CREDITORSReservationsInconsistent Stipu lations A deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors which reserves any benefit to the grantor himself or which introduces limitations and contin gencies such as will give him control of the property or its proceeds so as to enable him in effect to defeat the conveyance or which reserves to the grantor power to revoke it or which stipulates for the maintenance of the grantor or his family or for his employment at a fixed salary is fraudulent The deed in the case at bar is not obnoxious to any of these objections 2 ASSIGNMENT FOR THE BENEFIT OF CREDITORSFraud per seDiscretion to trustee to sell in course of tradeReplenishing stock A discretionary power vested in a trustee to run and operate the business for a year if he deem it wise to do so having in view the interest of the creditors secured does not render void per se a deed of conveyance of a stock of goods Nor is such deed rendered void by the further provision empowering the trustee to re plenish the stock by cash purchases of such articles as will aid in keeping up the business and disposing of the other stock to better advantage 3 ASSIGNMENT FOR BENEFIT OF CREDITORsEmployment of debtor as salesman A conveyance to a trustee of a stock of goods to secure creditors which au thorizes the trustee to sell in the usual course of trade for a limited period and to that end to employ clerks and salesmen is not invalidated by the fact that the trustee employs the grantor as his chief salesman to dispose of the stock of goods  Reported by M P Burks State RepOrter 594 JanHURST  CO V LECKIE 4 ASSIGNMENT FOR BENEFIT OF CREDITORSRelease clauseWhat must be con veyed If a debtor stipulates in his deed of assignment for a release from his debts by the creditors secured he must convey all or substantially all of his estate or all of substantial value He cannot convey a part only to pay his creditors and keep back a part for himself 5 ASSIGNMENT FOR BENEFIT OF CREDITORSRelease clauseFailure of debtor to deliver all property conveyed A deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors whereby the debtor conveys his entire estate except such articles as are ex empt by the poor debtorss law and which contains a release clause is not invalidated by the failure of the debtor to turn over and deliver to the trus tee in pursuance of the terms of the deed any property of any kind except that exempt as aforesaid The title to the property being vested in the trus tee with the right to immediate possession he can recover it from the debtor or other person who withholds it 6 ACKNOWLEDGMENTSCertificateParol Evidence The acknowledgment of a deed to entitle it to recordation must be before the officers and according to the form prescribed by law and the certificate thereof in that form or to that effect must be written upon or annexed to the deed The certificate must contain all the requisites of such form and no omission can be supplied by parol evidence But a substantial compliance is all that is necessary 7 ACKNOWLEDGMENTSCase in judgmentCertificateCommissioner in chancery In the case in judgment the certificate of acknowledgment of a deed was as follows State of Virginia City of Buena Vista towit I T F Mole a Commissioner in Chancery for the city aforesaid in the State of Virginia do certify that G W Leckie and E M Leckie whose names are signed to the writing hereto annexed bearing date on the 30th day of August 1897 have acknowledged the same before me in my city aforesaid  Given under my hand this 30th day of August 1897 T F Mole Commissioner in Chancery Held The certificate is sufficient As the city of Buena Vista had no circuit court at that time the certificate could only mean that T F Mole was a commissioner in chancery for the Corporation Court of the city of Buena Vistaan officer duly authorized to take such acknowledgment Appeal from a decree of the Corporation Court of the city of Buena Vista pronounced December 12 1898 in a suit in chancery wherein appellants and others were the complainants and the appellees were the defendants Affirmed The opinion states the case Winborne  Batchelor Barton  Boyd C B Guyer and G D Letcher for the appellants F T Glasgow Wim A Anderson and H A White for the appel lees 1900 595VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER RIELY J delivered the opinion of the court The deed of trust from G W Leckie to Hugh A White trustee which is the subject of this controversy is assailed as fraudulent per se upon the ground that certain of its provisions are incompatible with the avowed purposes of the deed and are adequate to defeat it as a security for the payment of the debts of the grantor The clauses of the deed which are alleged to contain the illegal provisions are the following  The said Hugh A White trustee shall immediately take possession and con trol of all the property real and personal and mixed hereinbefore described and proceed to make sale of the same either privately or by public auction and as a whole or in parcels or parts as he maydeem best for the creditors and in order that the best interest of the creditors may be preserved The trustee may if it seems to him wise run and operate the merchandise business of the said G W Leckie for the period of one year from the date of this deed and if at the end of that time the indebtedness is not all paid and it is demonstrated that a continu ance of the operation of the business will be to the advantage of those creditors not yet paid then the said trustee shall continue to operate the business for another year unless a majority in the amount of the creditors then unpaid object in writ ing to the further operation and upon such objection by a majority in amount ot the creditors or if it is not demonstrated that it would be to the best interest of the remaining creditors at the end of the first years operation to continue to operate the business then the trustee shall proceed to sell such stock of general merchan dise at public auction to the highest bidder after giving reasonable notice of the time and place  The said trustee is authorized and empowered to make such purchases of addi tional stock for cash from the proceeds of his operation of the business as will aid in keeping up the business and disposing of the other stock to a better and more profitable advantage It is asserted that the foregoing clauses contain a reservation for the benefit of the grantor in providing for the continuance of the business by the trustee and that there can be no reservation to the grantor or to the trustee of any right power or control over the subject of the deed of assignment which is inconsistent with an absolute application of its proceeds to the payment of the debts secured It is beyond question that to reserve any benefit to the grantor himself or to intro duce limitations and contingencies such as will give him control over the property or its proceeds so as to enable him in effect to defeat the conveyance or to reserve the power to revoke it or to stipulate for the maintenance of the grantor or his family or for his employment at a fixed salary will render the deed fraudulent 2 Minors Inst 4th ed  680 and the cases there cited 596 JanHURST  CO V LECKIE The deed in question is an absolute conveyance by the grantor of all his property to the trustee is a complete immediate and unreserved dedication thereof to the payment of the creditors secured and pro vides for the immediate possession and control by the trustee It leaves no interest whatever in the property in the grantor nor reserves to him any use possession or control over it but by its express terms all rights and title to and possession and control of the property are abso lutely and immediately vested in the trustee It provides not only for the immediate possession and control of all the property by the trustee but for the immediate sale thereof by him for the purpose of paying the creditors in the order that they are secured It is only in the event that it seems to the trustee wise and advantageous to the interests of the creditors that he is authorized to continue the business Nor is he empowered to do so for an indefinite time but he is expressly restricted to the period of one year unless the operation of the business for that length of time demonstrates that a continuance of the business for an other year will be to the advantage of the creditors who have not then been paid But even if that be demonstrated by the result of the operation of the business for a year yet upon the objection of a ma jority in amount of the unpaid creditors to a further continuance of the business the trustee is required to sell the stock of merchandise by public auction to the highest bidder after giving reasonable notice of the time and place of sale And if the trustee should deem it wise to run and operate the business for a year instead of making an immedi ate sale of the stock of merchandise the deed contains no provision that the trustee shall employ the grantor as agent or clerk to assist him at a fixed salary or that he should employ him at all It is not per ceived that the deed contains any reservation whatever for the benefit of the grantor No interest or right in or to the property or posses sion of or control over it or its proceeds is reserved to him Nor does the law condemn as vicious and illegal the provision of the deed giving to the trustee the discretionary power to run and operate the business for a year if he deem it wise to do so having in view the interests of the creditors It is not mandatory and does not oblige him to carry it on for a single day He may immediately sell and convert the property into money and apply the same to the payment of the debts in the order that they are secured It is only if in his judg ment best for the creditors that he may in his discretion carry on the business for a year taking that limited and definite period to dispose of the stock to the best advantage by retailing the goods for cash in 1900 597VIRGINIA LAW REGISTEP the usual course of mercantile trade and business and not sacrifice them by a forced sale by public auction The provision would seem to be a salutary one instead of fraudulent and illegal It is also proper in this connection to observe that the deed requires the trustee to proceed at once to collect all debts and from such col lections and the proceeds of the sale of the property and out of the operations of the business if it is operated after paying certain charges and expenses to pay the debts in the order of their priority Nor is the deed rendered fraudulent by the further provision em powering the trustee to make such purchases of additional stock for cash from the proceeds of his operation of the business as will aid in keeping up the business and disposing of the other stock to a better and more profitable advantage It confers upon the trustee the au thority to make only such purchases as will aid in keeping up the busi ness and disposing of the other stock more advantageously The language of the provision shows clearly that the purchases of additional stock were to be only ancillary to the winding up of the business The power to replenish the stock for this purpose is not illegal Marks v Hill 15 Gratt 400 and Williams v Lord  Robinson 75 Va 390 The trustee is not empowered to incur any debt in making such pur chases The deed does not authorize him to borrow money with which to make the purchases nor to buy on credit He is restricted to pur chases for cash received from the operation of the business Buying for cash and selling for cash which he was required to do by the ex press terms of the deed he was not given a power to defeat the security for creditors provided by the assignment by risking the casualties of trade It is not perceived how the honest and prudent exercise of the power could so result The deed in question differs very materially from those pronounced to be fraudulent and void in Lang v Lee 3 Rand 410 Sheppards v Turpin 3 Gratt 373 and Catt Trustee v Knabe Man Co 93 Va 736 which were the authorities mainly relied upon by the learned counsel for the appellants to show its inva lidity It is free from their provisions which were incompatible with the avowed object of the respective grantors to furnish an indemnity to their creditors and destructive of the security provided In Lang v Lee the deed provided that the stock of goods should remain in the possession of the grantor reserved to him the power to make sales of them but to account to the trustee if called upon and authorized him to pay off the debts secured by installments allowing him nearly a year to do so The grantor while affecting by the deed 598 JanHURST  CO V LECKIE to devote the goods to the payment of debts retained for ten months the possession the use and the power of selling every article thereof to whom in what manner and on what terms he pleased but to ac count if called upon These powers were incompatible with the avowed purpose of the deed The only effect of the assignment was to mask the property As was said by Judge Carr in that case we cannot imagine a power more completely adequate to the destruction of the avowed purpose of the deed than that retained by the grantor In Sheppards v Turpin the deed conveyed the whole estate of the debtor avowedly for the purpose of securing all his creditors yet re served to him the right to retain possession of all the property for three years also the right to carry on his business as a brickmaker to any extent that he and his trustees might think proper empowered him to borrow money from the trustees and they to advance to him any sums they in their judgment should deem sufficient for the prosecution of the business authorized the trustees to become his sureties upon all con tracts for the hire of laborers he might make and if at any time after such loans or advancements were made the trustees should deem his conduct injudicious or unthrifty they were given the power to sell the trust property if necessary to pay such loans and advancements and to discharge the contracts for laborers upon which they might have become sureties In the right reserved to the grantor to carry on the business for three years was implied the power to sell the stock in trade on hand and conveyed without any provision in the deed securing the application of the profits of the business during the three years or such time as he retained the possession and carried on the business under the provisions of the deed or of the profits or proceeds arising from such transactions as might be based upon the contemplated advance ments by the trustees to the payment of the debts secured Judge Daniel truly said  Under the power to make the loans provided for in the deed the property might at the expiration of the three years have stood charged with sums sufficient to consume it to the entire exclusion of all the creditors assenting to the deed In Catt Trustee v Knabe Man Co the deed of trust was declared to be illegal because it required the trustee to conduct the school known as The Wesleyan Female Institute for a period of eighteen months and to that end authorized him to employ tutors and such other agents as he might deem necessary and pay them a reasonable compensation for their services out of the trust funds and made their salaries and the running expenses of conducting the school a primary charge 1900 599600 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan upon the corpus of the trust funds and superior to the rights of the creditors It was therefore pronounced fraudulent per se and void because it subjected the corpus of the trust to the hazard of the unsuc cessful operation of the school and made the operating expenses and liabilities prior in right to the creditors in the distribution of the pro ceeds of the trust subject Very different are those cases from that at bar The incompatible and destructive provisions which rendered the deeds in those cases invalid are absent from the deed of assignment in this case Here the possession and control of the property conveyed is not retained by the debtor nor the right reserved by him to continue the business and sell and dispose of the stock of goods as he might think proper with only the personal liability to account to the trustee if called upon as in Lang v Lee nor is there the retention of possession by the debtor for three years and a reservation in him of the right to carry on the business to sell the stock in trade on hand or to borrow money to operate the business and the liabilities so incurred in the operation of the business made a preferred charge upon the trust subject thereby subjecting it to the casualties of trade as in Sheppards v Turpin or an express and positive requirement t at the trustee shall continue the business for a definite period whether or not he deemed it judicious to do so in the interest of the creditors secured or it proved to be advan tageous to their interests and the creditors subordinated in the distri bution of the proceeds of the trust fund to the liabilities incurred in the conduct of the business by the trustee as in Catt Trustee v Knabe Man Co but an absolute conveyance and unreserved dedica tion of all the estate of the debtor to the payment of his debts and the investment of the trustee with the immediate possession and entire con trol of the property and the power to sell the same at once privately or publicly as a whole or otherwise with the superadded discretionary power if he should deem it wise having solely in view the interests of the creditors secured to carry on the business for one year and to re plenish the stock with such purchases as would enable him the more readily to dispose of the stock of merchandise conveyed as ancillary to its advantageous conversion into cash and the winding up of the trust The business was not to be conducted for the profit and benefit of the debtor but wholly with the view to the largest realization of the trust subject and the greatest advantage of the creditors In Marks v Hill 15 Gratt 400 it was held that a power in a deed of trust to secure creditors to the trustee to continue the business andHURST  CO V LECKIE replenish the stock if merely intended as a means of realizing the trust fund and with a view to the winding up of the business as is plainly apparent was the object of these provisions in the case at bar did not render it fraudulent per se and avoid the deed It is not pos sible to read the deed in this case and not see that all its provisions were solely intended to realize the greatest amount from the trust subject for the payment of the creditors and were not designed to benefit the debtor The same principle was affirmed in Williams v Lord  Robinson 75 Va 401 See also Catt Trustee v Knabe Man Co 93 Va 740 The fact that the trustee elected to carry on the business for the limited period prescribed by the deed did not invalidate it The right to do so if in his judgment wise was clearly conferred upon him and as seen above such a provision is not illegal Nor does the further fact that the trustee employed the debtor as his chief salesman to dispose of the stock of merchandise do so The deed of trust imposed on the trustee no obligation to employ the debtor in the event that he should deem it wise to run and operate the merchandise business but simply authorized him to employ agents to aid him in disposing of the stock The deed of trust in James v Whitbread 9 Eng L  Eq R 431 and also in Coate et al v Wil liams 9 Eng L  Eq R 481 expressly authorized the trustee to employ the grantor in winding up the trust and in carrying on the business if thought expedient by the trustee and to allow him such sum for his services as the trustee might think proper but did not specify the salary or compensation to be paid The deeds were sus tained in both cases These cases were cited with approval by this court in Marks v Hill supra where a provision in a deed of trust that the trustee with the consent in writing of certain of the creditors se cured should permit a particular one of the grantors to carry on the mercantile business the stock whereof was assigned by the deed and to replenish the same was held not to avoid the deed Our conclusion is that the deed whose validity is the subject of this controversy is not fraudulent per se and should not for that reason be declared void A further objection was made to the deed that while it stipulated for a release of the debtor from his debts he did not deliver up all his estate to the trustee it being charged that he withheld certain accounts on his books which he asserted he had transferred to his mother to pay a debt he owed her but had not done so It is settled law that where a debtor stipulates in his deed of assign 1900 601VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ment for a release from his debts by his creditors he must convey his whole estate He cannot convey a part only to pay his creditors and keep back a part for himself He is imperatively required where he stipulates for his release to convey all or substantially all of his estate or all of substantial value Long Trustee v Meriden Britania Co 94 Va 594 and the numerous authorities there referred to and discussed In the case under consideration the debtor granted and conveyed to the trustee for the payment of his debts his entire estate By the express terms of his deed he conveyed everything and omitted noth ing except what is allowed to poor debtors and exempted by law from subjection to the payment of debts Code secs 3650 3655 He granted and conveyed all his estatehis land personal property choses in action and all other estate of every kind species and description A deed of this character although it stipulates for a release of the debtor by his creditors under numerous decisions of this court is entirely valid Long Trustee v Meriden Britania Co supra Skip with v Cunningham 8 Leigh 271 Kevan v Branch 1 Gratt 274 Phippin v Durham 8 Gratt 457 Wickham  Goshorn v Lewis Martin  Co 13 Gratt 427 Gordon v Cannon 18 Gratt 387 Robinson v May 76 Va 708 and Paul v Baugh 85 Va 955 If the debtor failed to turn over or to deliver up to the trustee in pursuance of the terms of the deed any property of any kind except that embraced in the exemption in favor of poor debtors that fact would not invalidate the deed of assignment The title to all the property was absolutely vested in the trustee by the conveyance with the right to take immediate possession thereof for the purposes of the deed and he could recover from the debtor or other person any that might be withheld from him A still further objection was made to the deed as an impediment to the subjection by the appellants to the payment of their debts of the property conveyed by it that the certificate of acknowledgment does not show that the deed was duly acknowledged for admission to record and consequently that its recordation was invalid to affect creditors with notice thereof The specific objection made to the acknowledg ment is that it purports to have been made before a commissioner in chancery and that the certificate of acknowledgment does not show that it was made before a commissioner in chancery of a court of record nor that he was a commissioner in chancery of any court The cap tion of the certificate is  State of Virginia City of Buena Vista to 602 JanHURST  CO V LECKIE wit It is then certified

It has been held by high authority that if the certificate of acknowl edgment does not show the official character of the person who took the acknowledgment it may be proved by parol evidence but it appears that this was where the form of the certificate had not been prescribed 1 Devlin on Deeds sec 502 Van Ness v Bank of U S 13 Peters 17 Rhodes v Selin 4 Wash C C R 718 Byer v Etnyre 2 Gill 150 s

was not essential that the official character of the persons taking the acknowledgment should appear in the certificate but that it would be presumed that the acknowledgment was made before officers au thorized to take it These cases however arose before the enactment of the statute prescribing the form of the certificate of acknowledg ment which had the effect to change the law in this respect Acts 1813 ch 10 sec 2 p 35 1 Rev Code 1819 p 263 The certificate of acknowledgment to the deed in question certifies in the body thereof that the acknowledgment was made before T F Amole a commissioner in chancery and it is also subscribed by him 1900 603VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER as such officer This description of his official character implies ex vi termini that he was a commissioner in chancery of a court of record for under the laws of this State there are no such officers except com missioners in chancery of the circuit and corporation courts which are courts of record The said certificate also defines the territorial jurisdiction of the officer to be  the city of Buena Vista and shows necessarily that he was a commissioner in chancery of the Corporation Court of the city of Buena Vista for there was not up to that time a circuit court for that city Acts 189798 p 895 A commissioner in chancery whose territorial jurisdiction was limited to that city was plainly a commis sioner in chancery of the Corporation Court of that city for the terri torial jurisdiction of a commissioner in chancery of the Circuit Court of Rockbridge county would be the said county and not the corporate limits of a city within it The certificate of acknowledgment therefore certifies in substance that T F Amole was a commissioner in chancery of the Corporation Court for the city of Buena Vista It describes his official character and shows on its face that he was a person authorized by law to take acknowledgments to deeds It complies substantially with the require ments of the statute which is all that is necessary A strict or literal compliance is not required Acknowledgment of deeds either from convenience or necessity are frequently made before and certified by inexperienced or illiterate persons and to require that certificates of acknowledgments shall conform literally to the prescribed form would jeopardize titles to lands and might sacrifice valuable rights depending upon them A substantial compliance with all the material require ments of the statute as to the acknowledgment of the deed and the form of the certificate is all that is necessary If words equivalent to those in the statute are used it is sufficient This is the result of our own decisions and also the general current of the authorities Hock man v McClanahan 87 Va 33 Va Coal  Iron Co v Roberson and

temperaturevolume and on temperatureentropy planes all of which bring out very clearly the distinctions indi cated by the tabulated data the principal being the great volume of the working cylinder for the Carnot cycle the comparatively large pressures of the Otto the Beau de Rochas and the low pressures of the Ericsson diagram The Carnot cycle is thought impracticable on account of engine volume weight and cost the Beau de Rochas involves very high tempera tures and pressures and the Ericsson and Stirling engines seem likely to waste largely by dissipation of heat cc ThSe Brayton on the whole seems to promise best and while practical obstacles modify any application it yet remains true that recent reports would seem to place en gines operating in this cycle in the lead The most novel and perhaps immediately interesting feature of the paper is its illustra tions of the cycles discussed by forms in relief The accompanying engraving is an illustra tion of one of these a

the reproduction of a full grown sul phurbottom whale The mold for this was btained through the courtesy of the Cabot Steam Whaling Co at their station at Balena Newfoundland and was made from one of the largest whales taken this summer a skeleton of the same species was presented by the Colonial Manufacturing CO of St Johns Newfoundland As definite measures and weights of whales are not easily obtainable some details on these points may be of interest The animal a male from which the skeleton was procured measured V4 ft 8 in from the notch of the flukes to the tip of the nose or t9 ft from tip of flukes to tip of lower jaw I7he girth around shoulders was 35 ft and the width of the flukes 16 ft S in The skull over all measured 19 ft and the width acrossSCIENCE 249 AUGUST 21 1903 the orbits was 9 ft 3 in the length of the jaws was 20 ft along the outer curve while the combined weight of cranium and jaws ssras four tons The approximate weight of a specimen of this size as determined by Mr S a Ruck are as follows  Pounds Weight of bones  17920 ATeight of bltlbber   17920 Weight of flesh  89600 Weight of whalebone including the attached gum  1750 Weight of viscera and blood esti mated  13440 Total  140630 or not far from 63 tons t A 1J MEMORIAL TO SIR WILLIAM FLOWER My Lord Archbtshop Ladtes and Gentleqnen The late Sir BTilliam lRlower formerly di lector of this museum was one of my oldest and most intimate friends It was therefore with great pleasure that I agreed to the re quest of the Flower Memorial Committee to say a few words on the occasion of the pre sentation to the trustees of the bust of the late director The bust which as you will presently see so well represents the kindly countenance of our deceased friend is the work of Mr Thomas Brock RA and no one I think will deny that the talellted artist has achieved a re markable success in producing it But be fore formally presenting it I may venture to say a few words about him whose memory we seek to honor on the present occasion and about the excellent scientific work which he performed Born ill 1831 Flower was a member of a welllinown family of StratfordonAvon and showing remarkable taste for natural history in his early youth was educated for the medi cal profession He graduated at the Uni versity of tondon in 1851 and became a mem ber of the Royal College of Surgeons the  Full text of Dr Sclaters address on the occasion of the presentation of a bust of the late Sir William Flower to the trustees of the British Museum July 25 1902 same year In 1852 he read a paper to the Zoological Society on the structure of a spe cies of Lernur the first of a long series of communications to that society which con tinued for fortyfive years In 1854 on the Crimean War breaking out Flower joined the Army Medical Staf3 and was present at the battles of Alma Balaclava and Inkerman and at the capture of Sevas topool and afterwards did good work in the British Hospital at Scutari in acknowledg ment of which he received the Crimean medals On returning to England Flower quickly reverted to natural history and in 1855 was appointed demonstrator of anatomy to the MicTfllesex Hospital and curator of its mu seum Here he did excellent work and so plainly showed the stu that he was made of that six years later in 1861 on the death o Queckett he was appointed coliservator of the tnuseum of the Royal College of Surgeons This important post Flower held for twenty two years and as we all know carried out its duties in a most ef3ectual manner When the president of the Royal Society delivered to Flower the Royal medal in 1882 he said  It is very largely due to Professor iFlowers incessant and welldirected labors that the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons con tains the most complete the best ordered and the most accessible collection of materials for the study of vertebrate structure in existence From 1870 to 1884 Flower was Hunterian professor of comparative anatomy and physi ology and gave the admirable courses of lec tures on these subjects which have rendered his name famous in the annals of zoological science In 1879 on the death of Lord Tweeddale Flower was unanimously elected president of the Zoological Society of Iondon upon the council of which he had served for many years previously and retained this post until his death in t99 In 1884 the directorship of the great Natural Iffistory Museum in which we are now assembled became vacant by the death of Professor Owen and Flower being ornnz1brn consens1b most admirably fitted for it was selected for the post Of the way in which he performed the heavy duties of this

and even into the dense bark of hiclsorytrees Professor Mees found that to obtain similar results by shooting strarvs from an airgun velocities of from one hundred and fifty to one hundred and seventyfive miles per hour rere necessary Professor Mendenhall read a paper giving an account of the changes in the electrical condition of the atmosphere that are ob served during thunderstorms and referred to the excellent work doneby the Ner England Meteorological Society in the study of these most interesting phenomena Prof E S Nichols gave an account of a batterycell on which he and Mr W S Franklin had been experimenting in which both electrodes vrere iron but one ras in a magnetic field and the other not The magnetized electrode was found to be sometimes electropositive to the other and sometimes electronegative de pending on whether its magnetic poles were exposed to the liquid or rhether the neutral part alone was so exposed A difference was also found between those liquids tending to produce ferric salts and those forming ferrous compounds Professor Barker presented two papers on behalf of Mr Edison in one of which a magnetic balance similar in principle to Wheat stones bridge was described by xvhich the relative magnetic permeabilities of different samples of iron can be rapidly tested In the other paper Mr Edison described an ingenious form of ap 7Aaratus which he calls a  pyroelectric dynamo in which aIl electric current is obtained directly from heatenergy through the inductlon produced by alternately heating and cooling an iron core placed in a strong magnetic field and surrounded by an insulated coil Mr C E Monroe presented to the section the results of some curious experiments in which blocks of guncotton after having been stamped with certain letters were exploded on flat plates of svrought iron The guncotton blocks were placed with the lettered side down and it was found that when the letters were stamped in relief they appeared in relief on the iron after the explosion and on the other hand when the letters were depressed in the gun cotlon they were also depressed on the iron plate The session this year has been of considerable interest and the number of communications presented to the section unusually large Section C ReporZ not recezzoed zn tzse for Xss zssve Section D NINETEEN papers or subjects rere presented during the sessions tC this section by tnvelve gentlemen as follows on Nicaraguan woods and friction of engines by R H Thurston on the Ameri can system of waterpurification by Albert R Leeds a new method of finding an equivalent uniform load producing bending moments approximately equal to the maximum moments under a moving train the deflectlon of girders and trusses and reaction polygons and their properties a new general class of graphical polygons suitable for the comparison of the bending moments and shearing stresses in simple girders and single intersection trusses due to a moving train of wheel weights by H T Ecldy on an im proved method for testing metals by Challes E Monroe on the effect upon the strength of iron by subjecting it to a pull rhile hot Rankines solution of the problem of turbines and downward draught device for a furnace by DeVolson VTood on a new high speed steamengine indicator by J Burkitt Webb on errors of approximate calculations of the effect of the inertia of the moving parts of a steamengine by D S Jacobus on the theoretical effect of errors of observation in calorimeter experiments for de termining the latent heat of steam and improved arrangement of siemenss platinum electrical pyrometer by J E Denton on the uniformity of planimeter measurements by T C Menclenhall and John Mack on mechanical inspection of railsraytracks and results obtained by P H Dudley on the theories of the lateral pressure of sand against retaining walls by Mansfield Merriman on national armament by J R Haskell A 1lumber of these papers uTere accompanied by illustratixTe models or drawings and some by both models and drawings In some cases only a partial treatment of the subject was given a complete consideration being reserved for another paper In this way new lines of thought were suggested and the authors thus in dicated their intention of occupying the fields of thought which they thus partially opened up The section united with Section B Physics for an hour on Friday to hear two papers by J Burkitt Webbone on a new dynamometer which was illustrated by a working model and the other on the experimental determination of the reaction of a liquid jet On Monday afternoon Sections D and I combined to listen to four papers relating to different aspects of a plan for a Nicaragua shipcanal The first of these was on the general subject of isthmian transit by H C Taylor the second on the engineering features of the Nicaragua Canal by K E Peavy the third climatic and sanitary notes on the Nicaragua Canal route by John F Bransford and the fourth historical and geographical notes con cerning the Nicaragua Canal route by J W Miller Ishe work of the section may be mainly classified under four heads I Papers recording actual practical work in new fields as for example the paper on the mechanical inspection of railwaytracks which was accompanied by rolls of diagrams taken upon different lines of railway showing the condition of their tracks and from which the interestang and valuable results set forth in the paper were obtained 2 Papers illustrating new or improved special machines or de vices for accomplishing difficult ellds The new highspeed steam engine indicator by Professor Webb illustrates this class A model and drawings of the instrument were shown by means of which the theory and operation of the indicator were readily under stood 3 Papers based upon laboratory experiments like Professor Dentons on calorimeter experiments for determining the latent heat of steam in which the results of experiments with two forms of calorimeter were recorded and made the basis of valuable de ductions in regard to the theory and operation of the calorimeters compared 4 Discussions suggestions and criticisms relating to the applica tion of laws and principles and to methods of research and cotn putation of rhiCh Professor Eddys paper on reaction polygons and their properties is an example The papers were generally fresh and stimulating and clcarly aimed to advance scientific thought and attainments to secure the practical achievement of valuable work upon a scientific basis and to perfect theories and harmonizd them xvith actual facts and to secure their easy and correct applications in new Selds of scientific work The sessions of the section must have proved of value to all who followed the work done and many regret that most of the papers must appear in abstract rather than in full in the Proceed ings of the association Sectiorl E GEOGRAPHY is by title included with geology in Section E of the association but geology takes all the attention and in the present vigorous condition of geological investigation geography as a science is almost forgotten Under geology itself the work of the International Congress of Geologists and of its American com mittee received the greatest share of time as the vicepresidential address of Mr Gilbert considered the first and the several reports read by Dr Frazer introduced the second There has been appre hension anzong some that more might be attempted by the congress in the way of authoritative dictation and majority rulings on mat ters of opinion than would be justifiable in our rapidly advancing scienceor indeed in any science The dangers of such a course were well pointed out by Mr Gilbert  The proper function of the congress is the establishment of common rneans of expressing the facts of geology It should not meddle with the facts themselves It may reguiate the art of the geologist but ic must not regulate his science Its proper field of work lies in the determination of questions of technology it is a trespasser if it undertakes the deter mination of questions of science It may decree terms but it must not decree opinions For science it is not merely illogical it is SCIENCE

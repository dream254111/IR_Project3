BY MISS ANNIE S PECK of the American School of Aichaeology at Athens Some years ago a traveller while on the voyage from Western Europe to Athens was addressed with the following words  Ah so you are going to Greece without being compelled you go the right way to work to look for amusement Imagine mountains without trees plains without grass rivers without water a sun without pity dust without mercy fine weather a thou sand times more tiresome than rain a country where the vegetables grow ready cooked where the hens lay eggs hard boiled where the gardens have no leaves where the color green has been effaced even from the rainbow where your weary eyes will look for verdure and find not even a salad to repose upon But the traveller nothing daunted by this startling picture of a country of which his dreams had been so fair pressed on to know the worstto find that while these words contained a modicum of truth the land of Greece is484 Greece and Modern Ahens yet a realm of beauty worthy not merely of a poets pen but of the personal observation of every lover of nature and art as well for the fascinations of its present as for the glory of its past Indeed there is no coun try in Europe which so well deserves the attention of the student and traveller as none contains more beau tiful scenery sites of greater historic interest or such matchless treasures of art Hitherto Greece has lain beyondthe route of ordinary travel Of the thousands who yearly seek Italian skies hardly one in a hundred crosses over to the land of Plato and Pericles In comparison with Italy Greece is there fore almost a terra incognita Though situated in Eu rope and not far from Italy it somehow appears more re mote than its distance from the Italian peninsula would seem to warrant This is not however without reason for Greece as it were faces the East most of its cities and harbors lying on that side while Italy on the con trary faces the West The two peninsulas lie back to back and while Italy is a part of Western Europe Greece belongs to the Orient Its people evidently recognize this fact as in Athens when one speaks of going to France or England he says as we do that he is going to Europe as if he lived in Asia or in Africa So unfamiliar is this classic land that even the proper name of the country Hellas and that of its people Hellenes are doubtless unknown to many When a country has so euphonious a title as Hellas and one sa easily transferred to our own language it does seem a pity that we should persist in calling it by the unmelo dious and suggestive name of Greece merely becauseGreece and Modern Athens 485 the Romans more than two thousand years ago per sisted in calling its inhabitants Graeci or Greeks instead of their proper title Hellenes This country of Hellas then is a very small one at present comprising only half as much territory as the State of New York Its population is about two mill ions and there is one very remarkable fact in connec tion with it which is quite unexplainable and unparal leled except in the frontier settlements of the West where the cause is obvious There are in this country of Hellas nearly five per cent more men than women It is therefore the paradise of women as marriage is almost universal so much so that I remember meeting but one single lady of uncertain age while I was in Athens In ancient days Hellas in the strictest sense of the word comprised a territory even smaller than now Thessaly not being included while in later days on the contrary Macedonia was not deemed a foreign country but claimed a share in the glories pertaining to the name of Hellas It is surely a matter of wonder that a country so limited in extent should in the short space of two cen turies have produced philosophers statesmen poets orators and historians such as all the rest of the world has not been able to surpass and such marvels of sculpture and architecture as it has never equalled We must not however forget that the small area of continental Greece by no means contained all those who contributed to her fame and shared in her glory The islands of the Aegean the coasts of Thrace and Asia Minor Sicily and some portions of Italy were486 Greece and Modern Ahens either wholly inhabited or partially colonized by Greeks who preserving unadulterated their race and language sharing the same ideas and worshipping the same gods carried Hellas with them and formed an important factor in Hellenic civilization In the Aegean Sea there is hardly a solitary spot between sea and sky so the hardy mariner early ventured forth from the mainland and passing from one island to another soon crossed the sea Accordingly from the days of Priam until now the same peoples with the same lan guage and customs have inhabited both shores Arbi trary political divisions have made only an external separation and the Greek of today is as much at home in Smyrna as in Argos To the peculiar physical and climatic characteristics of the country the rapid and artistic development of its inhabitants was doubtless in some measure due The Aegean Sea apparently had a wonderful power in breaking up the land into islands peninsulas necks and promontories furnishing innumerable harbors Such a country is sometimes called Greek as this char acteristic is here most strikingly manifest and is shared with continental Hellas by all the coasts which the Greeks inhabited Hellas is cut off from the Danube valley on the north by high mountain chains extending from the Adriatic to the Black Sea the Thracian Haemus with imper vious ridges The country develops towards the south intercourse with the East being especially easy as that side is most favored with harbors This was particularly fortunate for the people in the davs of their dawning civilization as thus they wereGreece and Modern A hens 487 brought into contact with the older nations of the Orient Thence the Greeks gathered germs of every kind of knowledge which under their own sapphire skies bore the finest fruits and flowers of antiquity Italy facing the west was less open to eastern influ ences and hence the bloom of her civilization was sev eral centuries later But the whole of the peninsula was not equally fa vored Albania and Illyria to the northwest consist of rocky ridges and narrow defiles with a savage in hospitable coast and have always been the home of barbarians Macedonia east of the Scardus pass forms a striking contrast containing broad lowlands and great rivers belted in by chains of lofty mountains Mace donia and Thrace are connected with the Greek world by the formation of the coast but the interior differs being a highland country cut off from the sea Ad vancing into Thessaly we pass on its northern border the majestic form of cloudcapped Olympus rising to a height of ten thousand feet To the south the coun try loses a little of its Alpine character though the landscape in some quarters of Thessaly with its rugged mountains frowning cliffs and dusky glens is still so severe that the Greeks here pictured the scene of the terrible conflict among the gods when hills were torn up to serve as missiles and Pelion was piled on Ossa Now the formation increases in multiplicity and bays corresponding to the ramifications of the mountains open the land from east to west Here at 390 N Lat begins Central Greece Hellas in the strictest sense In the west the region of the Achelous River in Epirus is excluded from the general breaking up of Greece as488 Greece and Modern Athens it was also from its general development while on the east the Oeta chain extending to the Malian Gulf forms the pass of Thermopylae where there is only the breadth of a road between the morass and the rocky heights From here across to the Corinthian Gulf is a distance of only twenty miles This is an isthmus from which the peninsula of eastern Central Greece extends to Sunium Here is the main range of Parnassus 8ooo feet high held sacred not only for the celebrated oracle at its base but also as the starting point of a new human race the scene of the Deucalion legend of the flood when he and his wife Pyrrha saved on the mountain from the destruction which overtook man kind repeopled the earth by throwing behind them the stones which became men and women Near Parnassus is Mount Helicon haunt of the Muses and next Cithaeron and Parnes separating Attica from Boeotia These two districts while adja cent are wholly dissimilar Boeotia though having water on both sides is practically an inland country since the mountains rise so abruptly from the sea that there is hardly any coast and in the interior as at Thebes or Orchomenus one would have no reason to imagine that the sea was within a thousand miles It has damp fogs and stagnant waters especially the large and shallow Lake Copais which frequently overflows its banks As a consequence there is a rich soil and luxuriant vegetation also as a consequence the people have always suffered from the malaria which has a de bilitating effect not only upon the body but on the mind and this no doubt was the reason for the well known stupidity of the Boeotians who were a notoriousGreece and Modern Aliens 489 contrast to their brilliant Attic neighbors It is said too that a similar difference may be observed at the present day Attica on the contrary projects into the sea with gulfs and bays and has the clear atmosphere of the island world to which it belongs Its mountains are near the centre and it has a dry rocky soil so that greater labor was needed to develop its resources The Peloponnesus is in itself a whole Arcadia in the centre is surrounded by a mountain chain having branches in the surrounding districts which are terraces like Elis and Achaia or have new mountain ranges forming new peninsulas like Messenia Laconia and Argolis Arcadia is not at all the ideal landscape which one might suppose It was the later Roman poets and not the Greeks who described this district as a smiling land with grassy vales watered by gentle pellucid streams and inhabited by picturesque shepherds and sheperdesses tending their flocks and making love in romantic fashion It is however by no means a land scape for an opera but the least beautiful region of Greece The scenery is forbidding and monotonous a bleak unlovely tableland covered with low steep mountains and marshy plains The original river Styx is still to be found here so violent noisy and terrible that the ancients made it a stream in the lower world In some of these river beds a torrent will sometimes appear so suddenly that in an hour there may be a large stream where one has walked dry shod but in ordinary times these little rivers remind one of children put to bed in a grandfathers fourposter490 Greece and Modern A hens In the manifold contrasts there are certain laws which govern the development of the country The Greeks were debarred by mountains from intercourse with the mainland on the north while the mountains and the sea cooperate to divide the country into sec tions the sea at the same time furnishing a means of intercourse between the sections and also with the opposite coasts In the northern highlands the people were compelled to be peasants a hardy race of hunters and shepherds simple and natural Thence they issued south where their mission was to create states and establish intercourse with neighboring peo ples Soil is not everything but it is important The inhabitants of a plain are defenceless and millions easily become subject to one ruler But in the moun tains as in Switzerland courage rises with the ability to defend The multiplicity of culture and manners the varieties in language as well as the desire for polit ical independence found among the Greeks resulted from the mountains At the same time the valleys though secluded and guarded were open to commerce The sea was easily agitated and calmed having a multitude of safe bays opening into it but its secrets are never wholly learned hence it promotes progress Greece was much less fertile than Asia Minor and labor and struggle were needed to develop its resources Within its narrow boundaries howeverl the climate goes from beeches to palms North of the Aegean Sea the climate is like that of central Germany while in the Peloponnesus semitropical fruits are abun dant Mountains like Athos bear every species of tree that is found in EuropeGreece and LM1odern A hens 49I Thessaly produces few olive trees and the entire Pindus is destitute of the flora of Southern Europe but in the latitude of 390 the warm sea air penetrates into the interior Phthiotis produces rice cotton and the olive Euboea and Attica have scattered palms and the datepalm in Messenia bears fruit At Athens southern fruits need special cultivation but in Argolis just across the Saronic Gulf lemon and orange trees grow in a forest There is no other region of the globe where zones of climate and of flora follow in so rapid succession As a result there is great variety in thle living forms of nature and a diversity of produc tions which early aroused the attention of men and promoted traffic Such a country could not fail to mould its inhabi tants at least when the race was young to develop in them activity and industry a sense of beauty a love of freedom and personal individuality and these qualities were highly characteristic of those who dwelt here When we see how the districts are separated from each other by ranges of mountains we cannot wonder at the peculiarities and jealousies of neighboring cities be tween which intercourse was so difficult But in spite of these divisions the Greeks had a distinct nationality and everything was stamped with their own life their art science politics and religion rheir physical condition is shown by their plastic art They were of average height neither fat nor lean In their delightful climate and with their simple man ner of living sickness and deformity were unnecessary and beauty was the rule They were proudly con scious of their physical and mental gifts and in fact492 Greece and Modern Athens seem to be so today though in coming in contact with this spirit at the present time one would be apt to characterize it as vanity and conceit The general history of Greece in the classical period is more or less familiar to all The days of her pros perity were brief indeed but glorious with a glory that is imperishable and though two thousand years have passed since then there has never been a time within the period of modern history when so great an interest as at present has been felt in the study of the life and the works of that remarkable people It seemed almost as if the Greeks had dropped out of existence under the sway of the Byzantine Empire and the Moslems In deed the country did relapse almost into a wilder ness But in the early part of this century a new life dawned and once more Greece took her place among the nations The invasion of the barbarians in the dark and mid dle ages and the stern dominion of the hated Turks have left heavy traces upon the land and while the nation since gaining her freedom has advanced with rapid strides it must be remembered that that was hardly sixty years ago Athens itself was but a collec tion of a few miserable huts in the vicinity of the Acrop olis when the seat of government was removed thith er from Nauplia in I835 Its rapid growth to its pres ent population of more than one hundred thousand is like that of many of our western cities It is due how ever simply to its being the seat of government and not to its containing within itself the elements of so great prosperity The transfer of the capital from Nauplia to its present site was therefore a matter ofGreece and Modern Athens 493 sentiment in which feeling not only the Greeks but the whole western world had a share Who that has mourned over the downfall of Athens at the close of the Peloponnesian war and despised the envious hatred of the Spartans incompetent for the leadership themselves and yet unwilling to see Athens possessing the artistic literary and political su premacy does not now rejoice that at length after many weary years Athens again takes her place as the leader of united Greece a place which no envious Spar tans Thebans or Corinthians will be likely ever again to wrest from her Here as formerly for philosophy is now the princi pal site for the study of the antiquities of Greece To reach the  violetcrowned  city many travellers come from Trieste by a four days voyage two of these over the stormy Adriatic a route which may be con venient and even agreeable to the hardy sailor but to be shunned by all whom Poseidon compels to pay trib ute especially at the time of the autumnal equinox when I unfortunately fell a victim to the power of his majesty For two days there is no land in sight but the two days following spent in sailing past the islands of the western coast and around the Peloponnesus are almost a compensation for the wretched monotony of the first half of the voyage The first Greek soil to meet our eyes was that of Corfu ancient Corcyra where now as in former days there is a thriving commercial city The glimpses which we gained as we sailed along of the islands and distant coasts of the Peloponnesus pre pared us to behold a country unlike any that we had494 Greece and Modern AlZenis previously seen Here were rugged almost precipitous promontories rising abruptly from the sea apparently barren and destitute of human habitation No tints of green gave evidence of pasture or wood and no curling smoke indicated the presence of life Far away indeed one could fancy that along the head of some deep gulf the coast was less frowning and that a village was there nestled amid fertile fields but that was in the dim distance Near us all was rocky bar ren and precipitous though in rounding the southern extremity of the Peloponnesus we strained our eyes to catch sight if possible of a hermit who dwells on the face of one of those frowning bluffs five hundred feet above the sea his only companion the distant passing sail for the benefit of which he carefully keeps a light burning through the darkness It was dusk ere we reached this promontory of Su nium so that we missed the pleasure of descrying in the distance the historic spots which we were eager to be hold Our ship was even compelled to anchor outside the ancient harbor the entrance to which is so narrow that one might well prefer daylight for its passage Early next morning we were on deck and overlook ing the fine harbor at our feet gazed eagerly in search of the farfamed Acropolis and at the beautiful panora ma of plain and distant mountains spread out before us But the shouts of the boatmen who in their little skiffs surrounded the vessel recalled us to the prosaic necessities of baggage and debarkation and soon our feet were planted on classic soil A railway now con nects the busy seaport of the Peiraeus and its fortyGreece and Modern Aliens 495 thousand inhabitants with the more aristocratic seat of government four miles distant but the stranger on his arrival in order to save a change from carriage to car and again from car to carriage is more likely to engage one of the waiting vehicles which takes him and his luggage direct to his hotel in Athens It is however a rather monotonous drive over a very dusty road and the driver will persist in halting at the halfway house he says to rest his not very stalwart specimen of horse flesh but more likely to have a chat over a cup of cof fee or raki brandy with some of the inmates At length the Acropolis draws near and now winding around its base we soon reach Constitution Square on the sides of which the principal hotels are situated To the east looking down Hermes Street where the principal shops are located lies the royal palace back of the square of green which is planted with orange trees and oleanders But before examining the city in detail I should like to give you a general idea of the Athenian plain You have heard how it is surrounded on all sides by moun tains except toward the sea If you stand on the Acropolis facing north you have on your right Hymettus on your left Aegaleos long ridges extend ing down to the sea In front is Mount Parnes and off to the right between Parnes and Hymettus is the graceful peak of Pentelicus Now facing in an oppo site direction toward the south and southwest there is a magnificent prospect of plain sea and distant moun tains Four miles away but in the clear atmosphere seemingly not half that distance is the beautiful harbor Peiraeus and the bay of Phalerum then the Saronic496 Greece and Modern Ahens Gulf with the islands of Salamis and Aegina while beyond loom up the mountains of the Peloponnesus and the Isthmus some rising to the height of 6ooo or 7000 feet the whole forming an exquisite panorama of sea sky and mountain scarcely to be equalled elsewhere Hymettus a few miles east of the city is a very peculiar ridge of almost uniform height rising quite abruptly from the plain and extending for many miles with but a single break The highest point just east of the city is a little more then 3000 feet above the sea It is a desolate mountain with round soft out lines and dull gray tints These at sunset give place to those delicate hues which still entitle the city to the epithet  violetwreathed so long ago bestowed Parnes nearly 2000 feet higher with a clear outline and bold design has a more wild and savage appear ance Aegaleos on the west is lower and more irregular in outline and farther from the city There is a pass now called Daphne through which runs the modern road to Eleusis in about the same place as formerly the Sacred Way over which the procession passed some times numbering thirty thousand for the celebration of the Eleusinian Mysteries To the northeast is Mount Pentelicus whence came and still comes the farfamed Pentelic marble which contributed so much to the adornment of ancient Athens It is the finest statuary marble in the world and the mountain still contains material for twenty Parthenons The plain itself is far from being level In the cityGreece and Modern AIhens 497 besides the Acropolis rise the hills of the Areopagus the Museium Pnyx and the hill of the Nymphs and still higher the peak of Lycabettus on a spur of which the royal palace is situated Just east of the city flows the stream of the Ilissus a mere brook in which Soc rates used to moisten the soles of his feet in the hot and dusty summer weather That is more than he would be able to do at the present time as this so called river dries up altogether in summer while in the spring after the heaviest rains it rushes along a foaming torrent about knee deep The extremely rocky soil is here apparent and I no ticed that not only does the solid rock which has a very thin coating of soil frequently project from the surface but the plains are strewn with small stones Even in the cultivlated fields near Athens small stones about the size of the fist were scattered all over the ground and I thought the Greeks must be very lazy not to clear off their fields But when I made such a remark to a Greek gentleman he said  0 no they were not lazy They left the stones there on purpose to keep the soil down If they took away the stones the soil was so light that it would all blow away On the western side of the city is the Cephissus River somewhat larger than the Ilissus and most use ful for purposes of irrigation Indeed so much of the water is drawn off for this purpose that the river loses its way in the sand below the city and never reaches the sea In October the season of my arrival almost the whole landscape exhibited a warm brown tone which would I am sure have delighted the heart of any498 Greece and Modern Ahens artist and was beautiful even to a common mortal who holds a special aversion to that color for the varied hues of soft warm tints from light yellow to darkest sealbrown were shaded and combined in a manner most pleasing if one did not reflect that they existed where grass ought to be The shades of brown were broken only by the green olive groves which mark where the Cephissus flows and the gleams of gray and white marble from Hymettus and Pentelicus This appearance was owing to the fact that as usual there had been practically no rain for four or five months Naturally it was frightfully dusty and most of the country looked like a desert The summers are very hot and disagreeable so that most of the people who can afford it go to the seashore some have cot tages at Phalerum while others go to the islands of the Aegean where a more equable temperature prevails Those who remain at home spend the middle of the day in the house even the shops being closed for several hours at noon Business is done before nine oclock and again towards sunset the streets are filled with people At other seasons say from the middle of October to May the climate is most delightful The winter weather is like our September and October days with occasional showers and a great deal of brilliant blue sky Wild flowers blossom all winter and frost and snows are rare In the winter of I885 and 86 there was no snow on the plain and it appeared only for a few days on the summits of the neighboring mountains Greece is warmer than Italy and a far more delightful winter resort The autumn rains quickly change the face of theGreece and Modern Ahens 499 landscape and later as you look over the plain you behold all shades of green intermingling with and superseding the brown as wheat fields green grass and vegetables are clothing the country with verdure The plain is generally barren of trees except for the olive groves Hymettus is perfectly bare and rocky but the other mountains are clothed with a scanty garb of forests Though rather barren the Athenian plain is delicate in outline and elegant in all its aspects like the slender graceful race it nurtured The most striking object in the modern city is of course the kings palace It is built of white marble and limestone in a plain and simple style with an Ionic portico The king is a man of fortyfive or more a goodlooking pleasant gentleman formerly Prince George of Denmark a brother of the Princess of Wales The queen is a Russian a cousin of the present Tsar They may be seen almost any day driving and sometimes wvalking in the street like any ordinary couple It is said to be a particularly happy royal family The king has not much more authority than Queen Victoria as Greece is a constitutional monarchy but he is quite popular while the queen is extremely beloved They have several children and the coming of age of the Crown Prince a few years ago was celebrated with great festivities as was also his marriage some months later It is quite a polyglot family as naturally the native tongues of the parents Russian and perhaps I may say German as well as the Greek language must be familiar French of course the language of the diplo matic circles and of fashionable society while English is not neglected500 Greece and Moden Ahens On the lower slope of Lycabettus is situated the building belonging to the American School of Archae ology an institution established in I882 for the purpose of promoting the study of classical literature and an tiquities For several years various annual directors presided over the school the students in which are graduates of the various colleges contributing to its support Later a permanent director was appointed Dr Charles Waldstein a graduate of Columbia Col lege and an archaeologist of acknowledged standing in Europe while an annual director assists in the con duct of the school At the present time Prof Richard son formerly of Dartmouth is the permanent director Prof White of Harvard the annual director while Dr Waldstein still lends his assistance in superintend ing excavations Similar schools are supported by the English French and Germans All of them engage more or less in carrying on excavations in Greek soil as well as in the study of existing antiquities It is obvious that the city in its appearance resem bles many others in Europe The houses are nearly all of limestone and stuccoed though a few are of white marble The roofs are tiled with pieces in the shape of a half flower pot The city can hardly be called beautiful except in its location and surroundings though perhaps it has reason to be proud of its appear ance if its age be considered There are now a number of broad handsome streets but many are very narrow and circuitous and are lined with small low houses On these are queer little shops of all sorts and the people sit out on the sidewalks so that one usuallyGreece and Modern Ahens 501 finds it more convenient in these quarters to walk in the middle of the street From some of these shops savory odors greet you and you see exposed for sale innumerable little fishes from three to six inches longr all steaming hot from the fat kettle or perhaps I should say the olive oil kettle One sees also for sale many hot cakes about three inches in diameter which are fried in a similar manner These are very light and when eaten with honey form a breakfast dish fit even for an American The Greeks of the lower classes live in a very simple and frugal manner Their earnings are small laborers receiving not more than twentyfive or fifty cents a day Many of the houses especially in the country consist of only one room which is used alike as parlor dining room kitchen and sleeping room for the family The majority perhaps have not more than two rooms People generally have no fire they go out of doors to get warm except what is needed for cooking purposes and that is extremely little as bread is always bought and the poorer people live mainly on bread and olives in Athens no doubt eking out their scanty meal with some of the little fishes or hot cakes so freely exposed for sale Cheese is also a favorite article of diet and macaroni is much used The olives are different from those generally seen here being left on the tree till they are quite ripe i e black They are then packed down in salt and in a month or so are ready for eating They then present the shrivelled appearance of a stewed prune but are much sinaller They seem to be an ex tremely popular article of food being very cheap as well as nutritious The wealthy people live more in ac502 Greece and Modern Azhens cordance with the French style ordinary articles of food are of moderate cost except that beef is very dear and milk and butter are still more so as pasturage is poor and very few cows are kept in Greece Indeed in the rural districts it is impossible to get any beef or butter at all and sheeps milk is the best obtainable In Athens the hotels are well supplied with comforts both for the outer and inner man but in making an extensive tour in Greece one must be prepared to undergo various privations The people are extremely ambitious and the youth are eager to learn The small boy does not have to be driven to school but is anxious to acquire knowl edge As a result the Greeks are the best educated people in the world not that they have so many emi nent scholars but they have a smaller percentage of illiteracy than any other nation even Germany can show There are numerous public schools and gym nasia scattered all over the country and Athens boasts of a fine University organized on the German system with faculties of theology law medicine and philosophy It has also a school of chemistry and pharmacy an ob servatory and a library of one hundred and fifty thou sand volumes About three thousand students are en rolled and there is a large faculty Adjoining the University is the Academy of Science for the accom modation of Greek and foreign savants It is built of Pentelic marble in the Ionic style of architecture with colonnades and sculptured pediments It is adorned with painting and gilding after the ancient style and the effect is certainly charming under the brilliant blue sky of that region In the central pediment there isGreece and Modern Ahens 503 a group of marble statues representing the birth of Athena while the gables on the right and left are adorned with statues in terra cotta Athena and Apollo surmount the lofty Ionic columns in front which are not in the Greek style while sitting figures of Socrates and Plato adorn the entrance Churches are numerous in Athens and an old By zantine church of the eleventh century stands in the middle of Hermes Street The ceremonies of the Greek Church do not to the unintelligent observer differ very greatly from those of the Roman Catholic though the edifice itself is adorned with paintings but never with sculpture In belief there is considerable diversity and more sympathy exists between the Greek and English churches than between the Greek and the Roman Catholic The parish priests marry though not a second time and when one is promoted to a bishopric his wife must be put away A fact of some interest perhaps especially to Baptists is that the Greeks practise immersion only as baptism as they have done since the dawn of Christianity The people cannot be said to be very religious or spiritually minded but it is considered a matter of dis loyalty to the State not to support the State religion and the Greek field is for that reason a very difficult one for foreign missionaries Moreover as the New Testament was written in their own language they naturally think that they do not stand in need of in struction from outside barbarians The language spoken both in Church services and by the people generally is of course modern Greek The ancient language was fully developed before the504 Greece and Modern Ahens dawn of history and contrary to the impression of many it has lasted to the present day It is therefore a mistake to speak of the Greek as a dead language like the Latin Of course there has been a gradual growth and change but the difference between Modern and New Testament Greek is hardly so great as be tween that and classical mtuch less than exists beween the English of the present day and that of Chaucer The difference in pronunciation however is so great that it is often impossible for the classically trained ear at first to recognize the most familiar words There is considerable difference however between the written and spoken language the newspaper and literary Greek being much more like the classical while the colloquial Greek contains a considerable admixture of Turkish and Italian words But the Greeks naturally despise the Turks and are all united in the effort to expel for eign words from their language so that it seems prob able that they will even succeed in what has been pro nounced impossible in making their language grow backwards In fashionable society however French is generally spoken All wealthy people have French governesses for their children and many Greeks speak German and English in addition The French fashions in dress also predominate though some few of the city people and the majority of those in the country have a fashion peculiar to themselves Passing from Constitution Square down Amelia Street we shall be very likely to see a steam tram car which runs from here to Phalerum Not far from the square we reach Hadrians Arch or GateGreece and Modern Athens 505 To the east of Hadrians Arch is the Olympieum or Temple of Olympian Zeus On our way to the south side of the Acropolis we might pass the choragic monument of Lysicrates and soon after we should come to the theatre of Dionysus and the Odeium of Herodes Atticus and so on to the Areopagus which lies on the northwest side of the Acropolis a little lower and quite near to the ancient market place and the busiest portions of the old city Somewhat further to the north stands the Theseium the best preserved edifice in ancient Greece Though inferior in grace and splendor to the Parthenon and in beauty and elegance to the Erechtheium its almost complete preservation causes it to make an extraordi nary impression Not far beyond and close to the Dipylon Gate is a spot which must be of absorbing interest to everyone an ancient burial ground of the Greeks formerly the only one known in Hellas and still by far the most important The modern cemetery lies on the opposite side of the city to the southeast beyond the Ilissus River Some of the ancient customs are still preserved and one day in spring as in former times people go out with offerings of cake wine and flowers which they place upon the graves where they also burn candles Here the mourners sit and many of them give way to violent grief wailing in a perfunctory manner over the death of some member of the family who as we could observe from the tombstone had passed away several years before Others however deposit their gifts more quietly The use of a hearse at funerals is a very506 Greece and Modern A hens recent innovation A few years ago the body was borne through the streets on a bier with the face ex posed to view The mourners walk along near the corpse followed by their friends and neighbors Sev eral priests in black robes usually head the procession I suppose that by the law of contrast funerals are often associated with weddings The Greeks are generally a very friendly hospitable people willing to allow strangers the privilege of wit nessing some of their peculiar ceremonies And so we secured the honor of an invitation to attend a wedding though we had no previous acquaintance with any of the members of the family The ceremony was to take place at eight oclock Arriving at the house a little before the appointed hour we were welcomed by the sisters of the bride who escorted us at once into the best room In the centre of the room was a small table upon which was soon placed a large salver bearing a quantity of con fei of various colors and sizes and two wreaths of artificial orange blossoms tied together with long white satin ribbons A thin quarto copy of the Gospels with a cover of heavy enmbossed silver also lay upon the table There were besides two large bundles done up in white napkins which excited our curiosity consider ably In the meantime four priests had arrived attired in their customary dress of long black gowns with high black hats on their heads Soon after the groom ap peared Next we were astonished to behold the four priests arise lay hold of the two bundles and from them bring forth their outer garments gorgeous trappings in which they proceeded to invest themselves in most undigGreece and Modern Ahens 507 nified haste before the assembled company just then the bride came in quite informally was introduced to us and spoke to other friends and then she and the groom took their position in front of the sofa where we had been sitting The four priests in their colored vest ments and one deacon in plain garb stood around the little table I he bride was attired in a silk dress of blue gray and garnet and wore a veil of tulle which reached the floor The veil was embroidered with white silk to the depth of a quarter of a yard from the bottom and was fast ened by a wreath of artificial orange blossoms A spray of the same served as a brooch and others as ear rings She was petite and pretty a brunette as a mat ter of course The groom was a fine looking man of thirtyfive or forty years As they took their places each laid a gold ring upon the silver covered book and each received a prettily adorned lighted wax candle about three feet in length which they held throughout the ceremony The service began with chanting by the priests one reading the others making responses The words were uttered rapidly and were in the main un intelligible Sometimes there was reading in an ordi nary tone of voice The first act of especial interest was the taking of the book from the table and present ing it to the couple touching first the forehead and lips of the groom then of the bride This was done three times Next came the putting on of the ring The best man who is an intimate friend or relative now stepped forward and taking the rings placed one on the little finger of the right hand of each then changed them back and forth several times finally leaving them508 Greece and Modern Ahens in their original position Both parties wore gloves which were not removed during the ceremony and im mediately afterward the bride changed the ring from her fourth to her third finger while the bridegroom transferred his to the other hand The placing of the crowns upon their heads followed This was first done by one of the priests Then the best man took his place behind the bridal pair and moved the crown back and forth from one head to the other three times The repetitions of these various formis are made in recog nition of the Trinity When the crowns were first placed upon their heads the guests took up some of the confeli from the salver and pelted the bridal couple on the head and shoulders sometimes hitting other people and making the air quite lively for a minute The next ceremony was the taking of a glass of wine from which one of the priests first drank He then held it to the lips of the groom who took three sips as did afterward the bride There was a small loaf of bread upon the table A part of it is sometimes put into the wine but this we did not observe Such is their mode of partaking of the Sacrament Lastly one of the priests took the bride by the hand Her other hand was held by the groom and he was followed by the best man and so hand in hand they passed around the table three times being all the time pelted with confelli by the guests After a few closing words the newly married couple took their seats upon the sofa the priests proceeded to disrobe and do up their gar ments and the service was over Some of the guests went to the married pair and presented their congratu lations one or two only kissed her Next came inGreece and Modern Alhens 509 two servants bearing salvers On one of these were tumblers containing a chalky looking liquid which was made of almonds boiled with sugar and was cool and agreeable to the palate The other salver bore little frosted cakes confetil and other kinds of candy to which each one helped himself in proportion to his ap petite Strange to say the bridal pair were not the first to be served as with uis but almost the last We being strangers were given little lace bags full of confetz4 an honor not shared by the others After presenting our congratulations we withdrew We attended a reception among persons of a differ ent class of society the genuine Albanian peasantry On entering we were introduced to a sisterinlaw who acted as hostess and were then presented to the bridal pair who were seated in state upon the sofa The bride a young and lovely brunette wore a garment made of heavy homespun cotton with solid silk em broidery around the bottomred blue green and other colorsmore than half a yard deep Above was a little jacket of the same material the sleeves of which were heavily embroidered with gold braid and pre sented an appearance of great richness and elegance Over this was a sleeveless garment somewhat longer and slashed at the bottom forming lapels It was of heavy white felt trimmed with crimson silk braid Upon the head of the bride was a little skull cap of bright yellow silk and fastened to this with gold pins was a veil of strawcolored gauze about a yard in length which had a gold fringe several inches deep around the bottom IIer hair hung down her back in two braids Large silk cords were braided in with her hair and510 Greece and Modern Ahens from each plait depended a heavy silk tassel Upon her head was also a decoration of gold coins which hung down upon her forehead and similar though larger gold ornaments formed an elaborate necklace Silver bracelets on her arms completed her toilet Her husband was dressed in a corresponding Albanian garb The most striking part of this attire is a white skirt often measuring fifty yards in circumference so full that it stands out as if from crinoline This skirt does not reach to the knee and it gives the wearer the appearance of a ballet girl Below this skirt appears a cream white garment and below the knee the limbs are sometimes encased with leggings of leather broadcloth or cro cheted worsted Low pointed shoes or slippers cov ered his feet Over his shoulders was a jacket of fine felt or broadcloth with sleeves consisting of uppers only undersleeves showing below The jacket was also open in front and showed a spotless shirt and a little cap adorned his head In a few moments a woman brought in a tray upon which were several glasses of water with spoons and a tumbler of jelly The guest is expected to take a spoonful of jelly and a glass of water eat the jelly and drink as much water as he choses then place the spoon in the glass and return it to the salver The sisters of the bride said that she would continue to wear the Albanian costume for a year or two then she will subside into third rate European dress aban doning the picturesqueness of her native garb This variety of costume gives a certain interest and charm to the streets of Athens When we first went to Athens it was about the time of the enrollment ofGreece and Modern Athens 511 soldiers for the proposed war and the streets presented an unusually animated appearance Besides the Euro pean garb three others were seen One of these was a soldiers uniform one the Albanian dress and another a peculiar costume is always of dark blue a closely fit ting jacket and trousers which are really a skirt gath ered in closely below either knee leaving the rest as a full bag Long blue stockings and low shoes generally complete this outfit It is certain that some of the modern Greeks bear a strong resemblance to the ancient and we cannot but feel gratified that the majority of archaeologists are now agreed that they rightly claim inheritance from the ancient Hellenes In looks in bearing and in mental qualities they undoubtedly display many of the charac teristics of their distinguished progenitors Within the last thirty years the advancement of the people and the development of the resources of the country have been so rapid that we may reasonably feel confident that the Greek nation will become an important factor in Eastern civilization

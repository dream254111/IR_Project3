ENGINEERING I feel that in this discussion we engi neers occupy rather an unfortunate posi tion on account of the fact that we are compelled to assume the position of critics The student comes to us from the teachers of mathematics presumably equipped with a knowledge of that subject and it becomes our duty to teach him subjects in which he makes use of this preparation and to find out whether he has learned to use mathe matics as a tool However I believe that only by friendly criticism can progress be made and that every one ought to be will ing to accept such criticism when given in the proper spirit I had much rather be criticized than criticize others and we teachers of engineering hope that we are always ready to receive suggestions not only from other teachers but from prac tising engineers I must first insist that for the engineer mathematics is to be regarded as a tool not as something which is studied simply for the development of some mental powers but for the ability which it ought to give a man to do somethingto use the results and methods which he has been taught in solving the problems of his profession There has been a good deal of discussion in the past as to the value of mathematics simply as a means of mental training with out reference to its use and perhaps most of us remember the paper by Sir William 1 Continued from the issue of August 7N S VOL XXVIII No 713 Hamilton written seventysix years ago in which he maintains that there is no one of the subjects in the curriculum which develops a smaller number of mental facul ties or develops them in a more imperfect and inadequate manner than mathematics I have never seen what has seemed to me a conclusive refutation of Sir William Hamiltons main arguments and for my part I am disposed to agree with him in general and to assign a comparatively low value to mathematics simply as a training aside from its applications I have not observed that students trained in this sub ject are able to reason any better than stu dents who have ignored mathematics in deed I believe that many nonmathe matical subjects afford a better training in reasoning than the study of mathematics This view may perhaps be justified by re membering that mathematics aside from geometry deals with questions of quantity and number but not with questions of quality The student puts certain fixed data into his mathematical machine and grinds out the result He does not learn to observe and tot discover the finer and more elusive but equally important sources of error likely to occur in the ordi nary questions of daily life because he is dealing with a rigid unyielding logical machine In this way his mind may be come hardenedhe deals with rigid demon strations and is unwilling or unable to ap preciate or submit to a less rigid method which is often the only possible one The best student of mathematics is frequently one of the poorest of engineers Give him fixed data and he will get the proper result but he may be entirely incapable of attack ing a practical problem or of deciding what the proper data are I have not observed that students of mathematics are as a rule more accurate than other students or that a training in the branches of mathematics above arith metic leads to accuracy Indeed it more often appears to pervert the sense of per spective and to lead students to work out a result to several figures in cases where a smaller number only may be significant Mathematics does not train the observation neither does it train the imagination except in the geometrical branches which are now comparatively neglected since the powerful modern methods in analysis have been in troduced Hamilton only allowed as I remember that mathematics adequately trained one faculty namely that of continuous atten tioin but I fail to see that this is trained any better by the study of mathematics than by that of language chemistry or by other natural sciences Unfortunately as at present taught it does train the memory in a way that it ought not to do The ordinary student of mathematics subor dinates perception to a memorization of formulae and rules I believe therefore that from the point of view of the engineer mathematics should be taught with the object of giving the student power to use it as a tool With reference to this I think it is fair to say that the consensus of opinion among engi neering teachers and practitioners is that the results of the present mathematical training are very poor The average stu dent who has completed his mathematical course is frequently quite helpless when called upon to attack a concrete engineer ing problem and it is a common remark by civil engineering students that they did not really learn any mathematics until they studied mechanics or the theory of struc tures The results seem to be almost equally poor no matter what institution the student comes from for in my classes there have been students from most of the prin cipal universities and technical schools in the country and I have failed to notice any great difference in them in that respect 258 SCIENCEAUGUST 28 1908 They very generally lack the power to do anything with the mathematics which they have been taught With reference to the reasons for this state of things I venture to state what seem to me to be some of them and the suggestions which have occurred to me by which possibly the results might be im proved 1 In one of the previous papers a state ment was made that many students who studied advanced algebra in the technical schools had not studied algebra in the pre paratory schools for the two years previous This illustrates what I believe to be one failing in our socalled system of educa tion namely the lack of continuity The remedy is to reform and simplify the cur riculum and to unify and simplify the entrance examinations to our colleges and technical schools So long as these en trance examinations are so extended and cover so large a range of subjects our pre paratory schools will be unable to carry out their true purpose which is as it seems to me no less and no more than that of all education namely to train a man thoroughly in a few things and to give him the power to do some little thinking for himself and to take up new subjects with out assistance 2 The great inherent difficulty which teachers of mathematics as well as teachers of every other subject meet with is the attitude of the student and his inability to realize the seriousness and the im portance of his work I am fond of ex pressing my view inregard to this by the statement that the school is not a restau rant but a gymnasium not a place where a student comes to be filled up but a place where he finds apparatus and the instruc tion by making use of which he may strengthen his mental muscles The manufacturer can take his raw ma terial and shape it into the form which he desires The raw material of the teacher is the student but the teacher can not take this material and shape it he can only show it how it can shape itself I believe however that much may be done in impressing upon students the proper attitude which they should take toward their work and by a proper cooperation between teachers and parents which is un fortunately lacking as a rule in this country and the responsibility for which must largely fall upon the parents 3 I believe that one cause of the poor results in mathematical teaching is that too great a stress is laid upon analysis Mathe matics is of course divided into geometry and calculus using the words in their widest sense Geometry is concrete and the mind perceives the steps in a geo metrical demonstration This branch the oldest branch of mathematics however has been largely supplanted by the modern analytic methods which have been de veloped during the past three centuries largely to the detriment it seems to me of the educational results obtained Analysis is abstractit is a powerful machine an invention for doing certain things Into one end of the machine we put the data we turn the crank and the result comes out with absolute correctness so far as is warranted by the data Now I believe that too much stress is laid on these analytical processes that the student is not urged to visualize his results to express them geometrically and to interpret his equa tions I warmly second the remarks of Professor Ziwet with reference to descrip tive geometry which I believe should be treated as a branch of mathematics and taught more thoroughly as it is taught in Germany For my part I derived as much benefit from my study of descriptive geometry and afterward from the study of projective geometry as from any other mathematical studies These studies train SCIENCE 259N S VOL XXVIII No 713 the imagination which analysis does not do But in the use of analysis the first step namely the formulation of a problem is really concrete This too is neglected in our usual courses Our examination papers are full of questions which involve simply the analytic processesthe differ entiation the integration the twisting and turning of equations while much less at tention is paid to the formulation in mathe matical language of practical problems Our students therefore when they meet a practical problem are unable to select or judge of the correctness of the data and even if they can do this are unable to formulate the data as a preliminary to the solving of the problem by the use of the mathematical machine One of the great defects which I find in students of mathematics is one already re ferred to namely that they do not in terpret their equations The average stu dent who has completed his mathematical course for instance has not the slightest conception of what a parabola is I make this statement advisedly because I have tested it again and again for years If he could tell you what a parabola really is in his mind he would probably tell you that it was a curve of more or less beauty represented by letters Perhaps he could tell you what the letters are but give him a concrete problem and he would convince you immediately that he did not know what the letters mean 4 Another defect as it seems to me in our present methods is the lack of training in mental operations In the good old days mental arithmetic was taught but that seems to have gone out of fashion with so many of the other good old methods Ask the ordinary graduate of our mathematical courses to tell you the square of 2075 without using pencil or paper and he will look at you open mouthed with astonishment but if he had really grasped the meaning of the binomial theorem and had learned to do a few sums in his head any grammarschool boy would of course be able to give the result immediately 5 Another reason for poor results is I believe inadequate classroom methods and especially the use of the lecture system In Germany where the students in the uni versities have had the advantage of a thorough preliminary training they may be able to appreciate lectures on mathe matical subjects although I doubt even this in the case of the average student For students in our American universities however I believe that lectures in mathe matics are almost useless except for a very small number of students and yet I am told that even in some of our high schools mathematics is taught to a considerable extent by lectures The lecture system is easy for the teacher It involves no cross questioning no endeavor to discern what is going on in the students mind no adap tation of question with the object of put ting him on the right track Again some mathematical exercises are conducted by sending the students to the board each with a problem to solve and then marking that on the correctness of their work Occasionally a formal expla nation of his problem is required of the student This again seems to me to be a mistaken method Many a student can go through a demonstration of a principle or solve a problem by substitution in a formula while knowing nothing of the real meaning of the subject In my opinion classroom instruction should be conducted by the Socratic methodby question and answerthe teacher endeavoring to put and keep the student upon the right track by showing him what he can do for him self if he will only learn how 6 Reference has been made to the kind of teachers of mathematics Personally I 260 SCIENCEAUGUST 28 1908 believe that in teaching the subject to engi neering students the best results would be obtained if the teachers were engineers or at least if they were near enough to being engineers to take an interest in the con crete problems themselves as distinct from their solution If I am correct in the be lief that mathematics should be taught as a tool then it can be taught best by those who know how to use it as a tool Un fortunately however it is difficult to get engineers who are sufficiently interested in mathematics and sufficiently masters of that subject who are willing to devote themselves to teaching The men who are interested in the problems prefer to devote themselves to those problems and to go into practical work It is not necessary however as suggested above that the teachers of mathematics should be engi neers if only they will take an interest in the problems themselves and in the point of view which the student should take They can do this by cooperation with the engineering teachers by attending engi neering courses and perhaps by a little more realization than they now have that their work is preliminary to other and more important work and that as a matter of fact if the engineering student does not learn to use his mathematics as a tool it is practically of no valle to him For the engineer mathematics is the servant and the mathematical teacher should aim to teach the subject in such a way as to obtain as nearly as possible the results which in telligent engineering teachers and practi tioners desire to have obtained GEORGE F SWAIN MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THE PROFESSOR OP MATHEMATICS IN THE ENGINEERING COLLEGE We must not take too seriously what engineers have to say in an educational discussion nor take too much to heart their views on the mathematical curriculum Practising engineers are not in the habit of thinking very continuously on any edu cational question although of course they must not confess inability to respond when they are called upon for pedagogical opin ions Every practitioner in the law would doubtless express views concerning legal education if summoned to do so but he would be a rash educator who would at tempt to follow their advice without much circumspection I myself prefer to judge of the engineers views upon educational matters by studying his actions rather than his words The things engineers do may be taken as a true expression of their deliberate judgmentwhat they say is often ill thought out and in contradiction to their deeds I therefore prefer to judge of the present needs in the mathematical instruction for engineers by the actual tendencies that I observe in the evolution of technology itself What are the great changes that the engineering profession has made in tech nical science in this country in the last quarter of a century The changes are quite obvious and not difficult to state In former days engineering technology was founded chiefly upon current practise rather than upon established principles it was more closely allied to the crafts than to science Not only is that day past but it is no longer the case that technical sci ence looks entirely to pure science for its fundamental material It has so grown that it is investigating for itself and in greater and greater measure developing the basal principles for its own needs There are very few American treatises in pure science which will compare in scien tific thoroughness with several treatises which have lately issued from the engineer ing press This is a very hopeful sign in the growth of knowledgeto see applied SCIENCE 261NS VoL XXVIII No 713 science and pure science approaching each other at numerous points so that it is in creasingly difficult to distinguish any line of demarcation between them In this change science is not sacrificitg any of its strength nor compromising its ideals It is technology that is changingthat is be coming less empirical more systematic more quantitative more scientific With these well recognized changes in applied science before us what should be our attitude toward the mathematical sci ence that is necessarily associated with engineering education What is tech nology really requiring of the basal sci ences Judging the engineers by their acts and not by their words what is the real demand that they are making of the physicist of the chemist or of the mathe matician Is the demand to teach physics or chemistry in this or that particular way or is the demand of a profounder and more radical sort The most superficial ob servation shows that the demand is of the latter kind The engineer in this twentieth century is saying to the physicist and chemist and mathematician Know more science Discover more facts in electricity in lightin all properties of matter Give to the world more men like Kelvin Hertz Helmholtz Fill the shelves with ten times the knowledge we now have These words more truly express the real pressure that engineers are putting upon workers in pure science than do the words they have uttered in this discussion As a single example note that the great elec trical and other manufacturing companies are impatient at the rate at which pure science grows and large sums are spent by them each year in the search for new truth and in filling up the gaps in exist ing knowledge The real demand of the engineer is not for better instruments or tools with which to do his work nor is the demand for more difficult projects to test his skill nor even for more capital with which to construct them The real demand is for more knowledge more science and for more of the spirit of science in technology and in technical education I take as my text a saying of Ostwald Science is the best technology If we teach a trade and not a science the time is largely wasted If we teach dyeing and not chemistry the graduate is already out of date when he begins his career and he has not the funda mental principles wherewith to bring him self abreast of the times I therefore re gard it of greatest importance that mathe matics be taught to engineering students with real enthusiasm for the science itself It should be taught by men who themselves are actively contributing to the growth of mathematical science The present spirit of engineering science is such that no in structor in any of the basal sciences is satisfactory who does not see that it is his duty not only to teach what is old but to be interested in and to take an active part in the development of what is new I regard of secondary importance the particular things we do in the mathe matical course in the engineering school Different instructors equally successful will have different opinions Various changes and improvements have been tried at various institutions At the University of Wisconsin we have made innovations whenever we thought it best but I regard them all of secondary importance to the first requirement of all namely that we demand the right sort of teachers and that the teaching be done in the right sort of scientific spirit The only imperative requirement put upon the mathematics in engineering schools that does not rest as heavily upon the mathematics of the ordinary college course is the demand for compactness It is possible that there is some room in the 262 SCIENCEAUGUST 28 1908 courses in colleges of pure science for the whims and fads of the various instructors for at some later place in the course the balance may be restored This however is not true in a school of engineering There is very little room for the practise of fads and new schemes It is easy to exaggerate the need of a special sort of subject matter in mathematics and a spe cial class of problems for engineering stu dents We are apt to make some very foolish mistakes if we undertake to change too freely the scientific material that is presented to engineering students A good engineer is worthy of the best science anq the best instruction that can be brought to himhe himself would be the first to object if a different program were carried out I have had a little experience in employ ing engineering graduates in engineering work In the past ten years I have given employment in various capacities to about one hundred and thirty engineering grad uates This work has been scattered over quite a wide territory and the men have come from the institutions of the east from the Pacific Coast from the Mississippi Valley and from the south I have been able to judge within the limits of my ex perience what the young engineering grad uates know and what they have forgotten I find it true that the boys have forgotten a great deal of the material they had in college and that they have remembered other things They remember the manual and the mechanical thingshow to swim how to ride a horse how to fish how to play ball how to run the level how to work the plane table and how to do stadia work Now what have they forgotten The men have forgotten the intellectual things hydraulics electrical science thermody namics etc The human mind possesses an unlimited capacity for forgetting But my experience shows that the young men forget their hydraulics just as quickly as they forget their mathematics or their mechanics The engineer in the field ob serves that a boy remembers the right end of an instrument and seems to be amazed that the same man does not know the right end of an integral sign He therefore concludes that the mathematics has not been taught right If he will compare intellectual things with intellectual things he will find that a miscellaneous group of engineers will pass as good an examination in mathematics ten years after graduation as they would pass in thermodynamics or hydraulics It grates on me to hear mathematics spoken of as a tool Mathematics is to the engineer a basal science and not a tool The spirit of that science is of more value to the engineer than the particular things that can be accomplished The engineer need not be a mathematician but he needs to think mathematically and to my mind he needs the power of mathematical thought more than skill in manipulating a few mathematical tools in mechanical fashion There are already too many fac torymade products turned over to the col lege by the secondary schools I make a fundamental contrast between the engineer with his mind endowed with the power of creative and rational design and the ar tisan with his hands equipped with tools for physical construction A great engi neer must be trained in correct seeing and thinking and must have the power of rea soning concerning some of the highest ab stractions of the human mind In this aspect mathematics is not a toolit is a basal science CHAS S SLICHTER UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN At the close of Professor Townsends address he urged the desirability of tech nical schools offering more elective ad SCIENCE 263N S VOL XXVIII No 713 vanced work in mathematics It may not be out of place therefore for me to call attention to the fact that in the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology we have offered and given among others the fol lowing courses advanced calculus vector analysis fourier series least squares the ory of surfaces theory of functions el liptic functions hydrodynamics and dif ferential equations of mechanics and phys ics Some of these subjects are required in one or more of our courses but not in any one of the larger engineering courses which are taken as the basis of Professor Townsends tables This elective work therefore while valuable in many respects is not the main work of the mathematical department The mathematical teacher is in the engi neering school primarily to teach to stu dents of engineering the amount of mathe matics which is necessary to them for the proper understanding and practise of their profession The object is to give the stu dent a grasp of mathematical concepts and processes through their use as one learns grammar by speaking a language Hence there is no place in the required mathe matics of a technical school nor indeed in the first courses in a college of liberal arts for the refinements of modern rigor At the same time there should be no pa tience with a loose or unscientific presen tation of first principles The teacher him self must be thoroughly conversant with modern thought else he will teach false hood for truth and must be enthusiastic in his interest in his subject else he will fail to inspire his pupils Hence the teacher of mathematics should be primarily a mathematician and not an engineer It is hard to find an engineer who has any knowledge of mathematics other than a small fragment which he habitually uses and any elementary teacher whose instruc tion goes to the very limits of his knowledge is sure of failure It may of course be possible to superimpose a mathematical training upon an engineering one but in that case the engineer becomes a mathe matician and my contention that mathe matics should be taught by a mathema tician is not invalidated On the other hand the mathematician should know something of the uses to which an engineer wishes to put mathematics For that reason such meetings as this are helpful but I must confess to feeling a little disappointment in not obtaining from the engineers any new light on the concrete problem which confronts the teacher of mathematics in an engineering school I have met the same disappointment else where in similar meetings It has hap pened elsewhere if not here that engineers will tell the mathematicians what and how they should teach in apparently total ig norance of the fact that what the engineer promulgates as a new gospel has been the commonplace thought of the mathematician for years This ignorance may be due to the fact that the engineer remembers his own training of twenty or thirty years ago and does not know that improvements have taken place That such is the case may be seen by a comparison of modern with older textbooks Such criticism from the engineers is amusing but another kind of criticism is not I refer to the kind which seizes upon the failure of a student to have learned mathe matics thoroughly as evidence of poor aims and inefficient teaching of the mathemat ical instructor We all know that students pass through our classes and graduate from our schools whose attainments are not what we wish but while the mathematical teacher delivers his product to the engi neering departments and hears of his com parative failures the engineering professor delivers his product to the world and rarely hears of the specific blunders of his stu 264 SCIENCEAUGUST 28 1908 dents Another unfair criticism is some times heard from the professor of engineer ing who says that students can not use their mathematics when the truth is they have simply forgotten some particular fact for mula or process which is a fad of that professor It is unfair to test mathemat ical training by tenacity of memory or mere quickness in reasoning I have said that we must teach our stu dents to use their mathematics Now in the application of mathematics to a con crete problem there may be distinguished three steps 1 The interpretation of the data of the problem into mathematical language 2 The formal operations upon the ex pression or equations thus obtained 3 The interpretation of the results back into the terms of the original problem The first and third of these steps are really the most important but there seems to be a popular impression that the second comprises the whole of mathematics This impression is doubtless responsible for some criticisms of the educative value of mathe matics It is true that relatively a great amount of time must be spent in the class room in teaching the mechanical processes involved in the second step and many stu dents in school and college get no farther To object to the amount of time spent in this way and to demand as some do that we confine our time to teaching general principles and applications is to talk as sensibly as a fond mother who objects to a child beginning his musical education by playing finger exercises instead of tunes The technique of mathematics must be learned first but the student who never gets beyond the technique has not learned mathematics The teacher of mathematics should then use all possible means of teaching the first and third of the above steps and should bring his pupils to think of them as the real thing For that purpose he should seek for applications and illustrations from as wide a range of subjects as possible He will find himself handicapped however in using many problems of real scientific or engineering importance because of the ignorance of his pupils especially in the first year in the technical school To illus trate a new mathematical principle by an application to a science with which a stu dent is not familiar is to befog and not illumine the subject Hence there is some thing to be said in favor of some of the muchcriticized problems of the older text books To my mind a problem is success ful if it causes the student to take the three steps just enumerated and is couched in terms familiar to the student even though it may not be practical On the other hand a type of problem lately coming into use in which the student is given some formula from a science of which he knows nothing and is asked to find say a maxi mum value is as fruitless as if the prob lem were stated in terms of x y and z unless it may serve to convince a sceptical student that the matter he is studying has some practical application And this leads me to the most important thing I have to say and that is that after the mathematical professor has done his utmost to teach the use of mathematics the engineering professor must take up and complete his work I doubt if any one really learned the use of mathematics in a first course Facility in using mathematics comes from actual use and not from the solution of illustrative examples In the course in mathematics the student expects his problem to be solved mathematically and has his mind alert to find the solution and that too with mathematical principles fresh in his mind In a course in engi neering his point of view has widely changed The practical problem has now his main interest mathematical concepts SCIENCE 265N S VOL XXVIII No 713 are in the background and he often fails to see the possibility of using mathematical principles until he is trained to do so by the professor of engineering If the pro fessor through lack of knowledge or lack of interest avoids the use of mathematics the student will soon lose the little he has learned In other words the mathematical train ing of a student is not complete when he leaves the department of mathematics It is possible that better results could be ob tained if the mathematical department had more time say for a course in applications of mathematics to miscellaneous problems But as a rule in our technical schools the department of mathematics is allowed barely time to teach the necessary tech nique with what illustrations and applica tions can be squeezed in Hence the math ematical department delivers to the engi neering department an unfinished product and it is the engineers duty to teach the student to use the mathematics he has learned Unfortunately the professor of engineering is too often a poor mathema tician and avoids this duty One of the hardest things a student has to do is to combine two different domains of knowledge each somewhat unfamiliar so that he may work freely in both at once using each as a help in the other It is this difficulty which makes analytical geom etry traditionally hard and which the stu dent meets again when he studies any form of applied mathematics It is partly to help overcome this difficulty that we have just made a rearrangement of our mathe matical instruction in the Massachusetts Institute of Technology We no longer have courses in algebra analytic geometry and differential and integral calculus but have combined these into one ccourse in mathematics extending through two years Into this course the elements of analytic geometry and of calculus are in troduced early and continued late We hope thus to give these principles more time to become completely domiciled in the students mind We have also been en abled to carry out two principles the first is to introduce no subject until some use is to be made of it and the second to handle each problem by the method best adapted to it rather than by the methods of the particular branch of mathematics which one might at the moment be study ing under the old classification We hope in this way to increase the efficiency of our mathematical teaching F S WOODS MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY The program shows three standpoints from which discussion is to emanate I occupy no one of them It is true I have had some engineering practise but I can not be termed a practising engineer I have had charge of mathematics for engi neering students in two engineering col leges but for nearly a decade now I have not met students in mathematics and indeed I have taught all told but an insig nificant amount I am in somewhat close touch with engineering students but they belong to a particular field namely mining which is possibly less dependent on mathematics than are other branches of engineering My viewpoint is there fore somewhat of a compromise or average of the three specified in the announcement The present discussion seems to me sig nificant It may bring forth results In fact it seems to have had some immediate consequences Last evening after the din ner I heard a very clever mathematician admit that he felt really humble and I heard a wellknown engineer say that to his great surprise some mathematicians had a human side I asked a pure mathema tician sitting near me to show me his hu SCIENCE 266AaGusT 28 1908 man side but he only shrugged his shoul ders Perhaps he was not yet sufficiently humbled This occasion appears to me to be signi ficant but as showing conditions which exist rather than as forecasting future changes It is a symptom of the approach the arrival perhapsof healthful condi tions rather than a cause It may of course in its turn become a cause and operate toward good results That is not so certain At the moment it indicates conditions surrounding the teaching of mathematics to engineering students in cluding the relations between the teachers of mathematics and those of engineering which have been the growth of many years Those young and virile gentlemen whom we all delight to honor the Woodwards have been striving for decades to bring about a closer relation between the teaching of mathematics and the subsequent study of practise of engineering Ten years ago at the Toronto meeting of the Society for Promotion of Engineering Education I pre sented a paper looking to this end2 There are gentlemen here present who discussed that paper and who may perhaps recall the remarkable unanimity between the teachers of mathematics and those of engineering as to the results most to be desired in teaching mathematics to engineering students and indeed as to the best available methods for producing such results This movement is old Most of the ideas which have been brought out here were first conceived a long time since Nevertheless it is good to get together and talk them over and such discussions may result in help to the individual teacher We have heard here much of the ideal which the engineering school should set before itself but it might well be asked what problem is presented first to the 2 See Proceedings of Society for Promotion of Engineering Education Vol V 1897 p 139 school as a matter of fact President Woodward put it in part when he spoke of the difficulty of getting the right men in the schools when operators are so eager for good men and are competing on the basis of so much per month And what do the employers demand They call for men who can do something men who can think in a logical and commonsense way but withal when they leave the school can be put to some immediate use The first problem confronting the engineering col lege is how to meet this demand for the demand must be met in some degree at least or the college will cease to train men It is inevitable that the character of this demand shall influence largely what the school must do The call is not for men highly trained in mathematics however much we may feel it ought to be It is for men who know well a little mathe matics and who can do something with it who can use it as a tool And however obnoxious that expression may be to a mathematical teacher he who forgets or disregards the fact which lies behind it will surely weaken his instruction of engi neering students I do not defend the specification of the employer I point to the fact with which we must deal Personally I am inclined to findl fault with it but the matter rests largely in the hands of the practising engi neer He though he often objects to the college product is to a great extent re sponsible for its general makeup In the long run and within reasonable limits he can have what he wants Sometimes he is inclined to require too much technical knowledge on the part of the graduate His brother teaching in the college in order to meet his requirement says to the teacher of mathematics I must have those students ready earlier with their mathematics This fact together with the general tendency in the colleges to raise the standards causes SCIENCE 267N S VOL XXVIII No 713 the mathematical training to be crowded into the first year and a half or two years when the student is least mature More of it is being pushed back to the second ary school and in turn into the grades Mathematical concepts are difficult and with President Woodward I am inclined to think we are demanding too much and calling for it too soon Covering less ground and at a slower pace will help to make better engineers The student comes to the engineering school with the notion that he is to be filled up with a lot of technical knowl edge the items of which will be used by him when he is a practising engineer He seems unable to comprehend that he is in college to acquire mastery over his own powers He is eager for useful facts and of course he forgets most of those he learns not a great while after leaving col lege The forgetting is to be assumed Under such conditions the task before the teacher of mathematics and quite as well before the teacher of engineering is to do his utmost to train his student to think logically and accurately about things To this end there seems to me nothing so effi cient as the solution of a large number of carefully chosen problems Indeed what is ones life if it be active except meeting a never ending succession of problems which must be solved if success is to be gained If you can teach your student to take vigorous hold of a problem to first as semble all the facts which bear on the question then from the facts to reason logically to a sound and safe conclusion you have started him well whether his aim be engineering or otherwise Of transcendent importance is the teacher his personality his attitude toward his work his knowledge of his students not as a class but of each as a human

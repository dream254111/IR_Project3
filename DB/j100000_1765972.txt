one continu ous process by a single machine The weight of the various sizes of tubing now manufactured ranges from 2r ounces per foot for the inch tubing which is the smallest size manufactured up to 17 ounces per foot for the 1inch tubing LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good faith On request in advance one hundred copies of the number containing his communication will be furnished free to any correspondent The editor will be glad to publish any queries consonant with the charact r of the journal Zoology in the Public Schools of Washington DC IF there be one thing clearer than another to all thinking people of this or of any other highly civilized nation at the present time it is that we are living in an age of great scientific progress Among the dominant most highly cultured races of the world this progress is characterized by its great rapidity the exactness of its methods and its farreaching influence It extends into all departments of human activity it is felt along every imaginable line both where the ends and aims are of a most utilitarian kind as well as in quarters where the results arrived at appear to be for a time of a most impracticable nature Solutions of abstract questions solved by the scientific philosopher and student no longer as of old remain for an indefinite period hidden in an in accessible literature but quickly see the light in many places and in an incredibly short space of time appear in the general litera ture of the day in school and college textbooks and even in the daily newspapers This being true it was wi4h no scant measure of surprise that the present writer had brought to his attention very recently a most remarkable case of misinstruction on the part of one of the teachers in a public school of Washington It is no more than fair to say however that the statement made by the instructor to whom reference is made is supported by the author of one of the textbooks in general use by the public schools throughout the District The book in question is Mr William Swintons  Grammar School Geography and in that production the author has adopted the plan of asking a series of questions and then printing the replies to them on one of the maps given in illustration On page 71 of his geography he asks What fish are taken in the Arctic region  and on the accompanying map leaves the student to choose among a number of forms there given none of which are fish however but where prominently occur such animals as the whale and the narwhal both of the last named being typical and wellknown marine mammals One of my sons attends the school to which allusion has been made and it fell to his lot to get this question and in making answer stated that no fish were named on the map in the Arctic regions whereupon the teacher contended that both whale and narwhal were fish and very big ones too directed him to take his seat marked the reply against him as a miss and ap peared to be well pleased that the next scholar in turn replied more in keeping with his own notions in the premises by stating that two large fish at least were found in the Arctic regions and cited the two that have just been named Now if there be one fact that zoology has made clearer than another and it has been given in all authoritative lexicons encyclopsedias and textbooks throughout the world it is that both the whale and narwhal are as has been said typical marline mammals and belong just as much to the class Mammalia as does a man or a bear The believing that the whale is a big fish carries us back almost to the time when people entertained such erroneous conceptions of the earth and the creatures that live upon it that it was popularly thought that the former was fiat that bats were birds and horse hairs could be converted into living hairworms My surprise is so great indeed at such a state of affairs existing in these times in our very midst that it absolutely forbids my makingany comment thereon for fear that language might fail me to do the matter justice It is surely high time that some effective course in ele N IE 207 mentary biology be included in our public school curriculum and the sooner it is done the sooner will our children come to be familiar with common facts the true nature of things as they exist and learn to appreciate the significance of a longexploded idea when they meet with it R W SCHUFELDT Washington DC April 4 The Question of the Celts D BRINTON in the last number of Science asks Dr P Max Foshay for evidence upon certain suggested points and now I should like to follow his example and ask Dr Brinton for bis evidence that Dr Theodore K0ppen repeats the familiar error of attributing the theory of the origin of the white race in Europe to Dr Latham whereas long before he mentioned it it had been urged with clearness by Omalius DHalloy the distinguished Bel gian anthropologist Science vol xix p 174 Both Otto Schrader Prehistoric Antiquities of the Aryan Peoples Jevonss translation p 85 and Canon Isaac Taylor  The Origin of the Aryans p 20 agree in assigning this distinction to the late emi nent English philologist as propounded by him in  The Germania of Tacitus with Ethnological Dissertations and Notes London 1851 Epiligomena p cxxxix now before me Will Dr BrintonI refer me to the work of the distinguished Belgian anthropolo gist and inform me whether he is in any way related to the dis tinguished Belgian geologist Omalius DHalloy  Also I should be glad to be referred to the work of Broca in which he states that  the small brown brachycephalic Celts are a mixed type Science ibid p 117 I have always understood Broca to maintain that they are a pure type the real Celts of Ceesars time and that they are now represented by the inhabitantsa of central France Again what is Dr Brintons authority for calling the type  of tall stature with reddish or blond hair and dolicocephalic crania the Kymric Is not this the Scandinavian or Teutonic type of Penka which he regards as the original Aryan type Dr Brinton is surprised to find Professor Schaaffhausen of Bonn denying that the bands who overran Italy in 893 BC were Cel tic Surely the title oftheir chiefs brenns  king is evidence enough that they spoke a Celtic dialect Science ibid p 146 But speaking a dialect is no proof of blood relationship and L suppose Sehaaffhausen thinks that the followers of Brennus were really Galated or of German origin This is the problem dis cussed by Niebuhr History of Rome English translation vol ii n 1169 in which the testimony of Celtic authors is quoted to show that the hair of the invading Celts was yellow or red while all Celtic peoples now have black hair Niebuhr thinks that the law of permanency of physical constitution does not hold good for the hair since now yellow or red hair has become uncommom among the Germans and Scandinavians in most parts Thus it would seem that owe can rely neither upon linguistic nor ethno logical arguments wholly to settle the vexed question of the Celts HENRY W HAYNES Boston April 6 AMONG THE PUBLISHERS THE famous geographer tisee Reclus has just received says The Publishers Weekly an unusual honor from the Paris Geographical Society It has long been one of the traditions of this society that its gold meJal should be awarded only to ex plorers who make discoveries of the first importance This yea it has deviated from its timehonored rule and has awarded its medal to a writer instead of to an explorer The honor was given to M Reclus to commemorate the approaching completion of his great work Nouvelle Gdographie Universelle The work is in eighteen large volumes and Reclus is now at work on the last one Reclus began this immense task in1875 It is a monument of geographical learning and though intended for the people and written in a popular style it is thoroughly scientific in spirit and treatment It is an interesting fact that if it had not been for the intervention of Darwin and other great scientifio men ot England this greatest of all popular geographies would probably IL r All 9

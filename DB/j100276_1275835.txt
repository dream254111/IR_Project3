the first volume of Harvard Studies in Jurisprudence It is inscribed as a dissertation submitted to the faculty of IHarvard Law School in compliance with the terms of the Research Scholar ship and is dedicated to Roscoe Pound to whom the author tells us in his preface he is indebted for the suggestion of the field of in vestigation for constant inspiration and for concrete suggestion and criticism The thesis which gives the title to the work and to which the first eightysix pages are devoted is in the language of the preface a plea for an enlargement of the equity powers of American courts which will enable them to give a real effect to their decrees for ex ample to transfer titles directly instead of by ordering a litigant to make the transfer The frame of the argument is thus summarized in the preface This is no innovation Such power exists in more or less perfect form in most of the states of the Union Its opera tion is not a matter of conjecture but can be observed over a period of more than a century of practice and in a wide variety of social conditions But some states and it is believed the Federal juris dictions also lack this power Moreover it nowhere exists fully for all cases and its need has become more apparent today because of a definite trend in our legislation aiming at a restriction of the con tempt process which constitutes the original and still here and there the only enforcing agency of our courts of equity These positions are convincingly maintained An historical sketch of our remedial theory and practice both at common law and in equity an analysis of the present state of the law in England in each of the states and in the Federal courts illustrations taken from judicial records of the inadequacy of the existing law a study of Roman law and the law of continental Europe which in itself will convince any law yer that we have needlessly denied ourselves some of the most use ful and convenient of legal remediesthese materials are brought to bear upon the thesis with unanswerable force The work is a model of constructive legal criticism The author makes his point so decisively that we cannot doubt that legislative action and what 1 The Enforcement of Decrees in Equity by Charles Andrews Huston SJD Pro fessor of Law in Stanford University Research Scholar in Harvard Law School 1912 1913 Cambridge Harvard University Press I915 Pp xxi I89MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW is quite as essential to a full realization of the remedial possibilities of the law a more enlightened attitude of bench and bar will follow The second part of the work enters upon ground more debatable Its thesis is that the classical doctrine that equitable estates and interests are merely rights in personam against the owner trustee or quasitrustee of the res has ceased to be true that even while we have insisted that equity acts only in personam and have except for a few aberrant decisions2 consistently applied that doctrine in its procedural aspect we have in effect and with some recognition of the effect come to treat equitable interests as true proprietary rights as rights in rem While there is no necessary connection be tween the two theses of the book since as Mr Huston points out3 we may have and do have remedies in rem for the enforcement of rights in personam and vice versa yet the second thesis has an ob vious bearing on the first since if the former be granted the move ment toward the extension of equitable remedies is seen to fall into place as one step in the really universal movement to adjust proced ure to the character of the rights to which it seeks to give effect4 At the same time the second thesis has an independent value far beyond this There are those who consider the question of the na ture of equitable rights as a mere matter of pious opinion without practical importance But every question of legal theory is of prac tical importance We may of course state a doctrine to be thus and so while we proceed to decide cases as if it were otherwise but the results can be satisfactory only so long as every one misunder stands the doctrine in the same way The arguments in support of the classical theory of equitable rights are both historical and analytical Of the historical argument Mr Maitlands treatment is typical5 Starting with the unquestion able position that the use was but a personal obligation upon the feoffee to uses it is shown how the Chancellor granted the subpoena first against one and then another class of third hands who had ac quired the res from the feoffee under such circumstances that their consciences were bound by the obligation The trust succeeded the use and rested upon principles fundamentally the same Equity following the law gave to cestuis interest an internal character as regards duration transmission alienationanalogous to legal ownership but this process did not of course affect its external characteras regards the persons against whom it was goodso 2 See pp 23 ff 28 ff 3 P 36 4 P 53 6 Lectures on Equity 112121 220EQUITY IN REM that this external character remained that of a mere right in per sonam Behind this statement of the history of the trust runs an implication that since there has at no time been a conscious break with the past the original theory must remain This line of argu ment Mr Huston meets by an historical analysis emphasizing the constant tendency toward attenuation of the trustees powers and reifying of the cestuis rights Ile refers to a parallel process in the Roman law by which equitable rights developed from rights in personam into rights in ren and to the similar development in our common law of the rights of the bailor HIe explains the want of conscious recognition of the evolution of the trust by reference to the fact that this development has been taking place at a time recent when compared with the parallel developments above adverted to and so at a time when juristic conceptions had become stereotyped by being already formulated In other words the slow but steady change in the rights of cestui que trust from rights in personam against the trustee to rights in rem available generally has been lost from view because the nature of the rights had been authoritatively defined while they were still personal The account of them given by Coke in the end of the sixteenth century is still repeated by the editors of our standard texts in the beginning of the twentieth cen tury as an adequate formulation of the rights by which the law pro tects the interest of cestui que trust7 By an historical analysis fol lowing these lines the author prepares us to find that the equitable interest has become a right in rem Finally as the latest chapter in the history of equity Mr Huston brings forward the case of In re Nisbet and Potts Contract8 in which the Court of Appeal upon the fullest consideration held that an equitable easement is enforce able against a disseisor of the covenantor and against purchasers with notice from the disseisor This case would seem to strike down the classical theory that equitable interests are only available against the trustee or quasitrustee and those who claim through or under him who in other words are in privity with him and to give full sanction to the prevalent form of statement that they are good against all the world except a bona fide purchaser While the case  Another analogy is to be found in the development of the rights of the mortgagor Being in England merely equitable his rights were at an earlier day unquestionably mere rights in personam In this country except for a few early decisions he has been recognized as the owner at law as well as in equity which unquestionably gives him rights in rem While this development is different from that under Mr Hustons con sideration in that it involves the extension of equitable doctrine into the law yet in the larger view the division of law and equity being but an historical accident the process is the same 7P 88 8 I905 I Ch 39I I906 I Ch 386 221MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW is not conclusive upon its facts as to the equitable interest being a proprietary interest Mr Huston shows in an analysis of the opin ions that it was placed upon that theory by the court9 The analytical argument is more involved Mr Langdell said10 If equitable rights were rights in reim they would follow the res into the hands of a purchaser for value and without notice The author clearly demonstrates that this reasoning is unsound In one of the most interesting passages of the bookl he collates numerous familiar instances in which full legal ownership is cut off by bona fide purchase Mr Maitland recognized2 that it is not an essential of a right in rem that the person who has that right can never be deprived of it save by his own act and he noticed sale in market overt and the Factors Act But he says really there is a marked difference between the two casesin that of the sale in market overt the buyer gets ownership but we do not conceive that he gets it from the seller for the seller never had ownership while the rule about the effect of a purchase in rendering equitable rights unenforceable is based on this that the trustee has ownership and transfers it to the purchaser and that there is no reason for taking away from the purchaser the legal right which has thus been transferred to him To this Mr Huston replies13 that The point of comparison is that in all the cases cited rights can fail to operate against a particular indi vidual and yet be none the less rights in rem The question of the way in which the ownership of the property transferred comes to the purchaser is beside the point here We agree that it is beside the point but feel that Mr Huston has not made this as clear as is desirable There is implied in Mr Maitlands argument a major premise which seems to have been in his opinion a principal sup port for the classical doctrine but which Mr Huston does not touch Discussing broadly the relations of law and equity Mr Maitland says14 An examiner will sometimes be told that whereas the com mon law said that the trustee was the owner of the land equity said that the cestui que trust was the owner Well here in all conscience there seems to be conflict enough TIhink what this would mean were it really true There are two courts of coordinate jurisdiction one says that A is the owner the other says that B is the owner of Blackacre That means civil war and utter anarchy Of course 9 P IIo ff 10I Harv L Rev 6o 11 P 124 2 Lectures on Equity 142 13 P 126 14 Lectures on Equity I7 See also p 156 222EQUITY IN REM the statement is an extremely crude one it is a misleading and a dangerous statementhow misleading how dangerous we shall see when we come to examine the nature of equitable estates Equi ty did not say that the cestui que trust was the owner of the land it said that the trustee was the owner of the land but added that he was bound to hold the land for the benefit of the cestui que trust There was no conflict here Mr Ames puts it thus15 The trustee is the owner of the land and of course two persons with adverse interests cannot be owners of the same thing Accepting this posi tion the question of the way in which the ownership of the prop erty comes to the purchaser is not beside the point for if he ac quires it from the trustee the trustee must have ownership and if the trustee has ownership the cestui cannot have it The position is however untenable It proceeds upon the assumption that the only way to obviate a conflict between the claim that A has owner ship and the simultaneous claim that B has ownership is to deny one of those claims in toto But is it not equally possible to say that both claims are good in part each involving the use of the word ownership in a special sensethat the trustee has certain rights and powers which it is convenient to call legal title while cestui has certain other rights which it is convenient to call equitable ownership and that the rights of both are in remn Instances are abundant of the application of the terms title and ownership to rights which are less than absolute ownershipthe case of the own er of a reversion and that of the disseisor come readily to mind But perhaps the closest analogy is furnished by the cases on mort gages in some of our states where it is said that the mortgagee has a legal title but that the mortgagor also has a legal title6 These verbally conflicting propositions are harmonized by the qualification of each title as a limited title the one involving certain of the elements of absolute ownership the other involving the residue of those elements Of course these cases reflect a poverty of technical terms but whatever else we say of them we cannot deny that under the name of title both mortgagor and mortgagee have rights in rem Nor can we say that the rights of these parties are in practical effect very different from the respective rights of mortgagor and mort gagee in England where the whole legal title is in the latter and the former enjoys but an equitable estate If then the parties both have rights in retiz in Illinois without anarchy resulting may not the same be true in England And if this is true of mortgagor and 15 Lectures on Legal History 262 16 See Lightcap v Bradley i86 Ill 5I0 Howard v Robinson 5 Cush Mass

was only avoided by forbearance on both sides As Mr Maitland notes there were oc casional open conflicts as when Coke was for indicting a man who sued for an injunction And there was no reason why the Chancel lor himself might not be indicted for obstruction of justice and the Chief Justice imprisoned for contempt of court but that the result would be disastrous and forbearance was therefore required The forbearance was mutual The law was not perhaps as frank as equity in admitting its concessions It may have called the trustee the owner in terms more unqualified than those in which equity called cestui the owner but in permitting equity to strip the trustee of the fruits of ownership or of ownership itself the law certainly made the more substantial concession And once the law has made the concession of permitting equity to take the property from the trustee it makes no difference so far as regards actual conflict of jurisdiction whether equity takes it from him by action in pcrsonam or by action in rei Nor is there any anomaly in the claim of proprietary rights for both trustee and cestui except in the fact that unlike most cases of divided ownership the respective claims were enforceable in different courtsan anomaly that is fast dis appearing But Mr Huston is not content with showing that the doctrine of bona fide purchase is not inconsistent with his thesis He proceeds to demonstrate that some of the phenomena of that doctrine are con sistent only with the real theory17 He relies upon the line of cases clearly the weight of authority which hold that a bona fide purchase of an equitable estate does not cut off preexisting equities To Mr Ames whose analysis of bona fide purchase1 is the most exhaustive ever presented from the point of view of the classical theory of equitable estates these cases are not all of one piece some he finds to be consistent with that theory others the line of distinctionl we need not examine are found to be inconsistent with that theory and are considered by him to be erroneous It is also interesting to note that while Mr Amess theory squares in result with many of the cases he is forced to admit that these cases do not go upon his theory In other words Mr Amess position involves what Mr Huston calls a special interpretation of the bona fide purchaser doctrineone which is not announced in the cases On the other hand the cases which hold that the bona fide purchaser of an equity 17 p II6 ff 144 ff 1 Lectures on Legal History 253 224EQUITY IN REM does not prevail do square exactly with the theory that equitable estates are proprietary rights in the res since if they are proprietary rights they will in the absence of any countervailing principle rank in the order of time And this is obviously the theory upon which they are rested by the courts They are dealt with in terms of preexisting equitable ownership But bona fide purchase is not yet disposed of Langdell Ames and Maitland have given us a rationale of bona fide purchase based upon the theory that equitable estates are rights in personam and if we were left without any logical explanation of the phenomena upon the predicate of the equitable estate being a proprietary inter est it would be difficult to accept the latter theory Mr Huston does not however leave us in this position What he says upon this head is so interesting that we feel justified in quoting it at some length19 The basis of the doctrine of bona fide purchaser is not a principle confined to its recognition in courts of equity and avail ing to cut off equitable titles only but one which runs through the whole fabric of modern lawan effort to ensure security in com mercial transactions and acquisitions by imposing certain responsi bilities on owners of property with respect to that property as a price of legal protection to their interests in it The French law in its doctrine Possession vaut titre has only gone one step farther in developing the idea that in a mercantile community where ex changes are the most characteristic and significant feature of its economy it is more important for the law to protect the dynamic institution of exchange by granting certain and safe acquisition of ownership than to protect the static institution of property by con ferring security of title  Caveat emptor is being modified by the change in social conditions into cazeat domitnus Let the owner take care in the selection and supervision of his agent let him watch the conduct of his trustee at the risk of losing his property rights through their wrongdoing if the transaction they carry through is with a bona fide purchaser    In the conflict of interests be tween owners and acquirers of certain special classes of property the free circulation of which is of particular business utility the social importance of encouraging transactions of preventing prop erty from stagnating has resulted in legal protection of the inter ests of the bona fide purchaser even at the expense of the property rights of the previous owner TIhese special classes of property tend to become more numerous as a nation becomes more industrial and conmmercial in its economy but they are as yet exceptional Now 19 pp I27 I30 134 225MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW as we have already seen the mere fact of bona fide purchase is in sufficient in the case of an equitable estate to give the purchaser priority He must also have completely acquired the legal title to the property in question to enable him to assert his claim against the person beneficially entitled to it In other words equitable es tates are at present not regarded as of the special sort as to which the encouragement of free exchange is of prime social importance    Until a scientific system of property transfer has been con structed the obtaining of the legal estate is the surest method of reaching certainty of ownership which the law permits And prac tically there is much to be said for the continuance of a device which however open to attack from the scientific point of view actually does enable a bona fide dealer to assure himself of the soundness of his title and to cut through even though he cannot disentangle the complications of conflicting equities Other features of equitable estates are relied on by the adherents of the classical theorythe want of any remedy for the equitable owner except that of personal decree the availability of the per sonal decree even when the situs of the res is beyond the jurisdiction of the court the want of a direct remedy against strangers the power of the trustee to release obligations held in trust the right of a third person who is sued upon a cause of action relating to the trust to set up a defense which is technically good against the trus tee but inequitable as against the cestui and on the other hand his inability to set off a claim against the cestui These problems are all faced conscientiously by Mr HIuston20 and shown to have no conclusive effect though some of them have an unmistakable logical bearing upon the theoretical question in hand At the same time some of these rules are shown to have been shaken by recent cases and these later cases are of course relied upon by Mr Huston as affirmatively supporting his thesis Of these cases the most impor tant is In re Nisbet and Potts Contract referred to above The writer believes that Mr Huston has made his point as to the nature of equitable rights The question is not removed beyond the field of dispute and we may be sure that the classical doctrine will continue to be advanced It seems quite certain however that the opposite position will be accepted with increasing frequency As the author shows it fits in with the larger tendency of the time to ward the fusing of law and equity And it is the position which is suggested by the current phraseology equitable ownership equit able title and the rest and therefore the position which even if it 20 pp I36I44 226EQUITY IN REM were unsound would tend to prevail by force of professional ig norance that potent factor in legal evolution Nor is it merely a matter of leading terminology Most of the rules concerning equit able estates even those which Mr Maitland sets aside as having to do with the internal nature of the trust bear the same way so that it takes all the finesse of an Ames or a Mlaitland to make the classical theory intelligible to the modern lawyer If Mr Huston shall but convince the more learned students of the law and this he cannot fail to do that his thesis is not logically inconsistent with the established rules so that their resistance to the heterodox doc trine is weakened then even though he does not convince them that the classical doctrine is obsolete today they will find that it is ob solete tomorrow We should not leave this book without adverting to the human ele ment in the whole business Mr Hustons modest monograph is of course but the latest word in a dispute that has raged for cen turies and not always without rancour In its latest phase it pre sents an issue between the generation of legal scholars that has just passed Langdell Ames and Maitland and those who followed and worked with them and a younger generation of which Mr Pound is the most conspicuous figure In one aspect it presents an evolu tion within the Harvard Law School But over and beyond all this if we concede that Mr HIuston has made his point we cannot ig nore that this places some of the most brilliant and most conscien tious of our legal scholars of the past and of the present generation in precisely the position which Mr Pound described as holding our taught tradition fast to the well worn path and fighting an obstinate retreat against development in new directions21 Nor can the rest of us who call ourselves scientific students of the law escape the indictment for who of us has not ranged himself with Ames and Maitland and fought in their rear guard And this sug gests again the everpresent danger to which Mr Maitland himself pointed in the observation that taught law is tough law22 Against this danger there is but one guardto bestir ourselves to the end that its toughness be that of living tissue not that of dead fibre23 EDGAR N DUREE University of Michigan Law School 21 Reports Am Bar Assn I912 p 996 2 Records of Lincolns Inn III Collected

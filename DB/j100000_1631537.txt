Allge meiner Theil Erste und Zweite Auflage Zweite Lieferung By E KORSCHELT and K HEIDER Jena Gustav Fisher 1903 The second instalment of the general part of Korschelt and Heiders Lehrbuch which has recently appeared maintains the high standard of excellence which we have learned to expect from these authors The instal ment includes only the sixth chapter that dealing with the maturation of the germ cells and with the phenomena of fertilization but it runs to more than two hundred large oc tavo pages and contains over eighty figures These numbers will give some idea of the comprehensiveness with which the subjects named have been treated especially if it be remembered that not a little collateral ma terial was considered in the first instalment of the work and is therefore omitted or merely referred to in the present part When all is of such general excellence it may seem invidious to make special mention of certain of the sections In section IV however there is presented an admirable statement and discussion of the maturation divisions in their relation to the reduction question and in its presentation certain new terms are introduced to indicate the three methods of maturation division recognized by Hacker To the method observed by overi in Ascaris in which both the divisions of the chromosomes are longitudinal and in which accordingly there is no reduction division in the Weismannian sense the term eumitotic is applied since it is the method characteristic of ordinary somatic mitoses For that method in which one of the chromosome divi sions is transverse and the other longitudinal the term pseudomitotic is suggested and this method is subdivided into a method of post N S VOL XVII No 440 reduction division in which the socalled re duction division succeeds the equation division and a method of prcereduction division in which the reduction division is the first to occur The possibility of a fourth method in which both divisions are reduction divisions is admitted but it is held that at present its occurrence is not proved An excellent section is also that on the maturation of parthenogenetic ova in which the question of the development of ova with a subnormal number of chromosomes is con sidered As in the preceding instalment of the work the statement of facts is throughout thorough clear and well arranged and opportunity is taken to discuss fairly their bearing on gen eral questions sections of great interest being devoted to the significance of the numerical reduction of the chromosomes in maturation to sex determination to the significance of fertilization and as an appendix there is added an excellent review of the theories of heredity and the allied theories of differentiation The figures are throughout well chosen and reproduced and there is an extensive bib liographical list J P ocM SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES THE American Anthropologist for January March Vol V No 1 recently

SOCIETIES ND ACADEMIES THE ACADEMY OF SCIENCE OF ST LOUIS AT the meeting of April 20 1903 Professor J A Holmes gave an illustrated account of some of the efforts that are being made in the United States to preserve the forests and other natural features of the country showing what is being done for the preservation of some of the great scenic features and partic ularly what the national government is doing in the way of national parks and forest re serves and in the protection of the forests on such reservations One person was elected to active member ship At the meeting of May 4 1903 Mr H A Wheeler gave an account illustrated by several lantern slides and some of the recently ejected material of the active Mexican volcano Colima of which he saw some of the recent eruptions It was shown that the material now being ejected is a trachyte or belongs to the acid series of lavas while the basal plain of the volcano is of basalt which is basic resting upon volcanic tufa It was pointed out that this sequence reverses the Richtofen order of volcanic discharges from which it was considered probable that there have been other centers of lava outflow besides the now visible vents of Mt Colima active and Mt Zapotlan inactive Samples of the ash from the eruption of February 28 in the form of granules 1 to 2 mm in diameter which fell at Tuxpan some twentyfive miles from the crater and which were secured by Pro JUNE 5 1903

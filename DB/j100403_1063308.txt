COTENANTSSECTION 3294 OF CODE OF 1887 GIVING RIGHT THEREFOR OMITTED FROM CODE OF 1919 RESULTThe Code of 1919 for some unexplained reason omits section 3294 of the Code of 1887an omission possibly fraught with important consequences This section was adopted in Virginia as early as 1792 and in sub stance is a reproduction of the Statute 4 Anne c 16 A D 1706 The provision of this section in the Code of 1887 is as follows An action of account may be maintained against the personal representative of any guardian bailiff or receiver and also by one joint tenant or tenant in common or his personal repre sentative against the other as bailiff for receiving more than comes to his just share or proportion and against the personal representative of any such joint tenant or tenant in common This statute served a very vital purpose in the law of real prop erty and has been reproduced in most of the American States At common law tenants in common and joint tenants by the very nature of their holding and relationship were each entitled to the possession of the undivided whole1 So where one joint tenant per mitted his fellow to occupy the premises the former could not claim a share of the profits made nor rent for use thereof2 The occupying tenant was only doing that which he had a perfect legal right to do Thus where a joint tenant in the absence of agree ment with the other used the land and by his industry realized profits as the fruit of his labor his fellows could not claim partici pation in such profits nor charge to him a rent for the use of the property3 In such cases the common law argued that if the joint tenant had suffered losses instead of making a profit the others would not be liable to him for their share of such losses Surely if they were not to bear the losses with him they should not share with him the profits of his labor They had no just ground of complaint since they had sat idly by and permitted such sole occupation The loss of what might have been their share could only be attributed to their own caprice or to their own indolence It might be proper to note here that if there were an agreement that such joint tenant occupying the premises was to act as bailiff or receiver of the others interests then an action of account lay against the occupier for the share of the profits rightly belonging 1 MINOR ON REAL PROP  884 919 7 R C L 820

his fellows rented the property to third persons he would be liable to the others for their part of the rents received5 To sum up the state of affairs at common law a joint tenant who occupied the common property was not liable to the others for rent nor for profits madeunless by agreement he had become the bail iff or receiver of their interests It is evident therefore that where the occupying tenant had agreed with his fellows or had re ceived rents from a third person for the use of the property he had received profits in which they had a right to share Their part of these profits was then in the nature of a debt which he owed to them and for which he should account But where profits were made out of the land by his own efforts and he not having been constituted a bailiff by his fellows there was no rational basis on which the latter could complain of the result Consequently no action of account was permitted6 So in order to remedy this situation the Statute 4 Anne in Eng land reproduced in Virginia as previously indicated was passed making a joint tenant or tenant in common without regard to any agreement therefor liable as a bailiff to his fellows for what he had received over and above his just share and giving to them an action of account therefor This action of account did not afford so convenient a remedy as did a bill in equity So at an early date there arose the practice of substituting the bill in equity for the action of account and this became the general practice whereby the old action of account at law soon fell into disuse7 But it must be borne in mind that the basis of equitys jurisdiction was the fact that the joint tenant or tenant in common had been made liable as bailiff to his fellows by this statutea right not existing at common law Of course even prior to that time if the matter was such as was cognizable in eq uity on some other ground then as ancillary relief thereto there might be given an accounting e g in partition8 Now after over a century and a quarter the revisors of the Code of 1919 for some unaccountable reason and without explanation have omitted this section entirely The question at once presents itself What is the result and what is now the law governing this subject in Virginia Obviously the result has been to restore the common law rule in all its harshness and rigor It was this section that made it possi ble to obtain relief in such cases This statute was the basis upon 4 FREEMAN ON COT  PART 2 Ed  269 6 Howard v Throckmorton 59 Cal 79 1881 Abel v Love  Fowler 17 Cal 234 1861 Pope v Harkins 16

authority to give reliefto take cogni zance of the existence of such a right namely an accounting be tween cotenants where one has received more than his share of the profits But the revisors having seen fit to abolish this foundation not only is the action of account abolished but the vital right of the other cotenant to hold the occupying tenant liable for the latters overplus of profits is likewise abolished The result seems most unfortunate S B W SOLDIERS WILLSTESTAMENTARY INTENTDue to the fact that soldiers and sailors in the active service of their country are often placed in positions where they have neither time nor legal ad vice for the proper preparation of their wills the courts have adopted a policy of leniency in the construction of such instruments Statutes exist in most if not all States favoring the wills of soldiers and sailors while in actual service1 A Soldiers and Sailors Act was passed in England during the late war to take care of just such wills2 The question recently arose in this State where a soldiers letter written from France to his wife was admitted to probate as a will3 The part construed as testamentary said     dont worry about the lotment or insurance for you will get everything that is coming to me    I have just fixed the insurance and lotment so you will get it alright The object of this brief note is to discuss whether or not the instrument should have been inter preted as a will The court while admitting the words had fixed were not in themselves testamentary in character yet justified its holding by saying that such construction was in keeping with what the soldierhusband expected and desired to be done Other letters were introduced showing his affection for his wife and why he should want his property to go to her As authority for its deci sion the court cited an English case Gattward v Knee4 It is sub mitted that the English case is to be distinguished from the case at bar in that the soldier there evidently had the animus testandi while writing the letter for he advised the person addressed to keep it in case it should be wanted later although the writer went on to say he would make a will in favor of the person addressed The letter it would seem was intended to take the place of a will until a more formal instrument could be drawn up In the case at bar the tes tator as the court acknowledges had no intention of making the letter serve as his will there was no animus testandi he intended to 1 See Va Code 1919 Sec 5231  Wills Soldiers and Sailors Act 1918 7  8 Geo 5 c 58 S 3

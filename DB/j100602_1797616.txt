Lieutenallt Alex 13urnes EICSt A  MAP of the Indus and Punjab Risrers from the Sea to La llore requires some 1lotice explanatory of its ccnstruction and I llave to otfer the followillg observations on that subject The liver Indus from the southern direction in which it flows ill its proress to the ocean presents few difficulties to the surveyor since an observation of latitude serves to fix the daily progress in the voyage and its comparatively straight course admits of easy eflelineatioll The map collsequently rests on a series of observa tions by tlle stars taken each nigl1t I should have preferred aItitudes of the SUI1 but with a people so suspicious as we ellcountered it was impossible to use al1 instrument openly in elaylight and I should have required to llalt the fleet twice to rocure eqllal aItitudes sillce the sun was south of the equator lurillg the voyage lMany of the large places such as Tatta Sehsuls Ooch Mooltall c c where we necessarily halted have been laid dovvn from a mean of eight ol ten stellar ob servations The longitude and gelleral delineations in tile curvature of the river rest on a minute protraction of its tlllnings carefully ob served evely

nly own protractioll nearly coincided with that which had beell assigned to it by Mr Elphin stoness surveyors who must have fixed it from Bhamrulpoor This was not the case with Bukkur but as the latitude of that place was tentytwo minutes below the true parallel I have leason to be satisfied with the result above stated I likelvise found that the Tndus receives the Pulljab rivers at Mittun iII the latitude of 28 55 instead of 28 20 N as given in the map of the Cabool mission but no one can examine tllat documellt vithout acknowledging the unwearied zeal of its constructor the late

the Inap the celltre of the city of Lahole which stands in 31 35 30 N and in 70 iS E lontitude have nlaterially assisted me in the task I have also placed the conHuence of the Jelum or Behut Hydaspes

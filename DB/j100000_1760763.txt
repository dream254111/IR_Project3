CHANNING THE LATEST SLIDES IN THE WHITE MO UNTAINS THE great slide of July 10 upon the north slope of Cherry mountain has been described in Science July 31 Since then others have been revealed at various localities but particularly at Waterville Upon August 13 the rainfall was excessive in that township The fields and hillsides about Elliots hotel were completely flooded and Mad River rose twenty or thirty feet It transpired shortly after wards that the famous slide upon the south side of Tripyramid had been renewed and enlarged and that upon the north side of the same elevation its double had made its appearanice This last one is not visible from any of the White Mountain locali ties much visited unless it be from the distant summit of Mount Washington I had the pleasure of visiting both these slides September 10 in com pany with several gentlemen and ladies from the hotel We walked up the northern slide first as cended the north peak of Tripyramid followed the ridge to the south peak and then descended the old slide to its base in  Beckytown Four slides converge into one at the upper end of the northern stream Two of them are too pre cipitous to be travelled over with safety Each of these tributaries may be about a half mile in length while the united stream below is about a mile long Its course lay entirely through the primitive forest and it did not reach so far as Nor way brook by a half mile An immense pile of treestumps and roots marks its lower extremity The ledges exposed are mostly of gabbro From north Tripyramid oine can see that the slides upon the westside of Mount Lowellthe old Brickhouse Mountainhave also been in motion the present season The old slide of Tripyramid started October 4 1869 in that wonderful rainstorm which cost the state of New Hampshire between one and two mil lions of dollars for repairs It has been fully de scribed in the Geology of New Hampshire The first steep slope amounts to threefourths of a mile then the current bends at a right angle and flowed to Beckytown a further distance of more than two miles where the trees were deposited which marked the end The new slide takes up nearly three times as much space at the beginning but the flood was less abundant below the bend During the sixteen years since the first catastrophe VOL VI No 140 bushes had grown over the base ground Those were not quite all removed by the last floods showing it to be less extensive The freshet which moved the bowlder from the Flume in Lincoln Franconia three years since seems to have been more powerful than any of this seasons slides C H HITCHCOCK AN HONOR TO AMERICAN OPTICIANS THROUGH the courtesy of Messrs Alvan Clark  Sons we are able to publish the following ex tract from a letter written to them by Dr Otto Struve  I am asked by the government to inform you that in acknowledgement of the excellent per formances of the great objectglass furnished for Pulkowa by your firm his majesty the Emperor has been graciously pleased to confer upon you the golden honorary medal of the Empire The value of this gift is enhanced by the circumstance that this medal is given very rarely and only for quite extraordinary merits You and Repsold are the first who will receive it from the present Em peror Alexander III This circumstance produces some delay in the transmission as the Emperor desires that the medal shall bear his portrait and not that of his predecessors Therefore the stamp must be newly engraved When that be done you will receive the medal through the Russian minister at Wash ington  When this letter reaches you 1 shall be on a journey through Germany and Switzerland First I shall assist at the general meeting of the Astro nomical association at Geneva and then must go for a cure to the wellknown watering place Carls bad Though my health is tolerably good at this moment I feel still very tired and from the illness of last winter there is left some affection that de mands serious treatment You will be pleased to hear that with the 30 inch refractor in good nights all the most difficult doublestars discovered by Burnham with the Washington refractor can be easily measured During the last weeks Hermann has collected al ready some hundreds of measures on similar ob jects that were out of the reach of the old 15inch refractor     OTTO STRUVE Pulkowa July 23 WEST AFRICAN ISLANDS MAJOR ELLIS known as the author of  West African sketches and other works accumulated the notes from which this volume was preparedOCTOBER 9 1885 SCIE1 during some fifteen voyages along the south and west coast of Africa This book would be supposed from its full title to be a geographical or statisti cal work from a military point of view It does indeed present facts of this character but also much more Written in an easy and unassuming style the author has skilfully combined with an I account of the chief geographical and economic  features of the islands a description of their at tractions their peculiarities their odd or extraordi nary inhabitants and a great variety of extremely amusing anecdotes We believe those of our readers who may be led by this notice to peruse it will find themselves abundantly repaid St Helena is first described rather briefly as already much written about then follow Ascen sion Fernando Po the Isles de Los St Vincent Samn Antonio Goree Grand Canary Teneriffe and Madeira Some information of a strictly veracious character will also be found in regard to the miracu lous island of St Brandan One of the most singular spots is the Island of Ascension which belongs to the British Admiralty and is enrolled in the list of ships in commission under the title of  the tender to H MI S Flora This originated in the fact that a vessel of that name was once anchored off the island as a store ship and part of the stores were kept on shore Naval discipline is maintained but a few ladies wives of the officers exiled to this barren spot are allowed to remain here submitting to naval rou tine which includes all lights out by 10 P M There is no water except intermittent collection of rain or dew insufficient for the needs of the in habitants Nothing can be cultivated though a few green things grow on the peak of one of the higher hills and in some narrow ravines which concentrate the scanty dews and showers Sea turtles and terns locally known as  wideawakes are the sole edible productions Cows are brought there and at first supply a small quantity of milk which is reserved for the hospital Should there be a surplus it is sold a bell being rung to an nounce the event but nobody is allowed to buy more than one gill After a time the milk dries up and the cow is turned into beef to save her from starving to death An American returning to England on the same steamer with Major Ellis went ashore to look at the island and came near running against an officer with flaxen whiskers who suddenly issued from a building The officer raised his eyeglass looked at the stranger with astonishment and be fore the latter could apologize called out   Sim mons  A bearded seaman responding  Ay ay COE 307 sir appeared upon the scene The officer con tinued  Simmons do you know what this person wants or who he is  No sir I cant say Im sure sir The American began to explain Sir I am a citizen of the United  when the naval man interrupted him and said  Simmons do you think he is a stowaway Cant say sir Im sure replied the imperturbable Simmons Is there a merchant steamer at anchor there  Yes sir Cape mail sir Well Simmons just go to the officer of the watch and ask if he has given permission to any person to board us And er see what this person wants The American now very angry began again  Sir I am  when he was again interrupted by the officer Sim mons I am engaged now I cannot see this per son Perhaps you had better take him to the officer of the watch And he went off before all the terrors of the United States could be launched upon his head while the seaman grinning re spectfully when his superiors back was turned conducted the irate Yankee to the officer at the landing place with whom he had but just come ashore Sociable fellows our British cousins even on a desert island  EDWARDSS BUTTERFLIES OF NORTH AMERICA THE perseverance with which Mr W H Edwards has continued his study of the butterflies of this country and the liberality with which he has illustrated their various forms ever since he first began the task are worthy of all praise The completion of his second series furnishes occasion to draw attention to its excellence When Mr Edwards first advertised in 1868 that he would attempt a complete work with ample illustrations on the butterflies of North America he probably little understood the nature of the task before him or foresaw into what fields his work would carry him Notwithstanding all he has accomplished the horizon broadening with his work is as distant as at the start At first his iconography was almost exclusively given up to the mere descrip tion of species with no attempt to illustrate any thing but the perfect insect Indeed the work proceeded for nearly three years before the first illustration was given of the earlier stages of a single butterfly Since that time but a single number has appeared which did not contain one The butterflies of North America By

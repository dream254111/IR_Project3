with equal force to a conditional sale of real estate Anthony v Smith 9 Humph Tenn 508 Fogg v Rogers 2 Cold Tenn 290 More radical than the decision in the instant case are numerous hold ings to the

absolute sale Bierce v Hutchins 205 U S 340 Greenwald v Tinsley 90 Miss 38 42 South 89 First Nat Bank of Corning v Reid 122 Iowa 280 98 N W 107 It is difficult to see on what legal principle it can be maintained that the retention of title by a seller is consistent with the accepance of a chattel mortgage by the buyer on the property sold as additional security for the purchase price The power to execute a chattel mortgage on property necessarily implies title in the person giv ing the mortgage Cornish v Frees 74 Wis 490 43 N W 507 In a conditional sale the seller retains the title The execution of a mortgage by the buyer on the property conditionally sold and its acceptance by the seller should it would seem ipso facto convert the conditional sale into an absolute one either on the ground that the condition is satisfied or that there is a waiver of title by the seller Thornton v Findley 97 Ark 432 134 S W 627 33 L R A N S 491 American Soda Fountain Co v Blue 146 Ala 682 40 South

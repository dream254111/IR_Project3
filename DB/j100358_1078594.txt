SCHOOL ON COMPREHENSIVE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS AND IN COLLEGE BANCROFT BEATLEY HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY THIS INVESTIGATION WAS CARRIED ON TO DETERMINE IN PART THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE SECONDARYSCHOOL RECORD AND OF THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION RECORD AS CRITERIA FOR JUDGING THE PROBABLE ABILITY OF THE CANDIDATE TO PERFORM WORK OF COLLEGE GRADE AND TO COMPARE THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS AND THE OLD PLAN EXAMINATIONS FROM THIS POINT OF VIEW IT SUPPLEMENTS THE STUDY ENTITLED THE RELA TIVE STANDING OF PUPILS IN HIGH SCHOOL IN EARLY COLLEGE AND ON COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS MADE BY EDWARD A LINCOLN AT HARVARD UNIVERSITY MR LINCOLN STUDIED THE SCHOOL EXAMINATION AND EARLY COLLEGE RECORDS OF 253 MEN ADMITTED TO HARVARD COLLEGE UNDER THE OLD PLAN OF ADMISSION IN THE PRESENT STUDY THE DATA WERE OBTAINED FROM SCHOOL EXAMINATION AND EARLY COLLEGE RECORDS OF 423 MEN ADMITTED TO HARVARD COLLEGE UNDER THE NEW PLAN EVERY CANDIDATE UNDER THE NEW PLAN IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A RECORD OF HIS SECONDARYSCHOOL WORK AND TO TAKE FOUR COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS SET BY THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION BOARD MR LINCOLN REVIEWED THE EARLIER STUDIES IN THE FIELD POINTING OUT THAT NO PREVIOUS STUDY HAD COMPARED THE SECONDARYSCHOOL RECORD WITH THE EXAMINATION RECORD AS A CRITERION FOR DETERMINING FITNESS TO DO COLLEGE WORK PROFESSOR W F DEARBORN2 AT THE UNI VERSITY OF WISCONSIN HAD DEMONSTRATED THAT THE ACCREDITING SYSTEM WAS EFFECTIVE PROFESSOR E L THORNDIKE3 HAD FOUND A LOW CORRELATION BETWEEN THE MARKS ON ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS AND COLLEGE MARKS SCHOOL AND SOCIETY V APRIL 7 1917 41720 2 BULLETIN OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN NO 312 3 EDUCATIONAL REVIEW XXXI MAY 19GO6 47083 141142 THE SCHOOL REVIEW FEBRUARY AND OTHER INVESTIGATORS HAD CONFIRMED THE FINDINGS OF ONE OR THE OTHER OF THESE BUT MR LINCOLN STUDIED THE SCHOOL EXAMINATION AND COLLEGE RECORDS OF THE SAME INDIVIDUALS AND THUS BROUGHT INTO DIRECT COMPARISON THE EXAMINATION AND SCHOOL RECORD AS INDICATORS OF THE PROBABLE ABILITY OF THE STUDENT TO DO COLLEGE WORK HIS CONCLUSIONS IN AGREEMENT WITH THOSE OF PREVIOUS INVESTIGATORS POINTED OUT THAT THE QUALITY OF WORK DONE IN HIGH OR PREPARATORY SCHOOL IS BETTER AND MORE ACCURATE THAN THE GRADES RECEIVED ON ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS AS A MEANS FOR DETERMINING THE FITNESS FOR WORK IN COLLEGE THE METHODS OF THIS STUDY THE DATA FOR THIS STUDY WERE SECURED FROM THE RECORDS OF THOSE HARVARD MEN WHO HAD BEEN ADMITTED BY THE NEW PLAN IN THE CLASSES OF 1920 1921 AND 1922 AFTER ELIMINATING THE RECORDS OF MEN WHO DID NOT REMAIN TWO FULL YEARS IN COLLEGE 423 CASES REMAINED TO FURNISH THE BASIS OF THIS INVESTIGATION THE METHOD EMPLOYED WAS SIMILAR TO THAT USED BY MR LINCOLN IN ORDER THAT THE RESULTS OF THE TWO STUDIES MIGHT BE COMPARABLE THE SCHOOL EXAMINATION AND COLLEGE RECORDS WERE AVERAGED AND THE AVERAGES ADJUSTED TO THE COLLEGE SCALE IN CALCULATING THE SCHOOL AVERAGE THE LATEST AVAILABLE MARK IN EACH SUBJECT WAS USED RATHER THAN THE COMPLETE RECORD IN MOST CASES THIS AVERAGE WAS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF MARKS OBTAINED IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OF SCHOOL IN A FEW CASES IT WAS NECESSARY TO GO FARTHER BACK TO DETERMINE THE LATEST MARK IN MATHEMATICS SOCIAL SCIENCE OR NATURAL SCIENCE THIS USE OF THE MOST RECENT MARK IN EACH SUBJECT RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE RECORD IS JUSTIFIED ON THE FOLLOWING GROUNDS I THE RECORD OBTAINED IS A COMPOSITE OF THE CANDIDATES FINAL STATUS IN EACH FIELD 2 THE CHARACTER OF THE WORK OF THE LATER YEARS OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL IS MORE SYSTEMATIC AND MORE CLOSELY RESEMBLES COLLEGE WORK AND 3 THE STUDENTS HABITS OF WORK ARE NEARER THE COLLEGE LEVEL THE SCHOOL AVERAGE DOES NOT INCLUDE MARKS IN COMMERCIAL SUBJECTS PRACTICAL ARTS MUSIC DRAWING OR ANY SUBJECT NOT ACCEPTED FOR ADMISSION TO COLLEGE THE RECORDS OF ONLY THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF COLLEGE WERE TAKEN RATHER THAN THE ENTIRE COLLEGE RECORD BECAUSE THE WORK OF THESE FIRST YEARS IS MORE INTIMATELY RELATED TO THE WORK1922 THE RELATIVE STANDING OF STUDENTS 143 OF THE PREPARATORY SCHOOL AND BECAUSE THE RESULTS REPRESENT MORE NEARLY PRESENTDAY CONDITIONS THE COLLEGE SCALE IS A LITERAL SCALE ABCDE FOR WHICH THE OFFICE HAS APPROXIMATE PERCENTILE EQUIVALENTS THE MARK B FOR EXAMPLE INCLUDES ROUGHLY THE RANGE FROM 75 TO 90 THE MIDPOINT 83 WAS ACCORDINGLY ASSIGNED TO B AND 88 AND 78 TO B AND B  RESPECTIVELY ERRORS INTRODUCED BY SUCH AN ARBITRARY ASSIGNMENT OF NUMBERS TO LETTERS TEND TO DISAPPEAR WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF MARKS IS CONSIDERED AS THE EXAMINATION MARKS WERE GIVEN ON THE SAME LITERAL SCALE IT WAS NOT DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AN AVERAGE FIGURE FOR THE EXAMINATION STANDING THAT COULD BE COMPARED WITH THE AVERAGES FOR THE FIRST AND SECOND YEARS OF COLLEGE THE SCHOOL RECORDS WERE GIVEN ON A VARIETY OF LITERAL AND NUMER ICAL SCALES THE PERCENTILE SCALE WAS USED MOST COMMONLY BUT AS THE PASSING MARKS VARIED FROM 50 TO 75 ON THAT SCALE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO USE THE AVERAGES WITHOUT ADJUSTING THEM TO THE SAME SCALE FOR PURPOSES OF ADJUSTMENT IT WAS ASSUMED THAT THE PASSING MARK REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ATTAINMENT IN ALL SCHOOLS AND THAT IF THE PASSING MARKS WERE MADE EQUAL TO THE COLLEGE PASSING MARK AND THE REMAINING MARKS BETWEEN THE PASSING MARK AND IOO PROPORTIONATELY CHANGED THE RESULTS WOULD BE COMPARABLE THIS METHOD TAKES ACCOUNT OF RELATIVE DIFFERENCES IN THE MARKING SYSTEMS OF SCHOOLS IT DOES NOT CONSIDER ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCES IN STANDARDS IT IS FELT HOWEVER THAT THE SCHOOL WITH THE EXTREME STANDARD WILL BE RARE AND THAT A SCHOOL WITH A HIGH STANDARD WILL BE OFFSET BY A SCHOOL WITH A LOW STANDARD MOREOVER MANY SMALL DIFFERENCES IN STANDARD DISAPPEAR IN CHANGING FROM A SCALE WITH SMALL UNITS TO A SCALE WITH LARGE UNITS IN THIS STUDY THE 423 CANDIDATES WERE PREPARED FOR COLLEGE IN 202 SCHOOLS IN 36 STATES THE WRITER RECOG NIZES THE ERRORS LIKELY TO BE PRESENT IN USING AVERAGES AND IN ANY ARBITRARY ADJUSTMENT OF MARKS TO A SINGLE STANDARD BUT THESE ERRORS TEND TO BALANCE EACH OTHER WHEN A LARGE NUMBER OF CASES IS CONSIDERED AS THE COLLEGE WORK OF SOME MEN HAD BEEN INTERRUPTED BY WAR SERVICE IT WAS DEEMED ADVISABLE TO CALCULATE THE COEFFICIENTS OF CORRELATION FOR EACH CLASS SEPARATELY TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE RESULTS WOULD BE AFFECTED BY THESE IRREGULAR RECORDS SO FAR AS IT COULD BED I C B IA I I I 17 171 I 12 SCHOOL I 1 16 I 2 2 45 50 55 65 801  95 10 0 1I I I IS I I 22

BE DROPPED BEFORE THE COMPLETION OF HIS SECOND YEAR 2 THE DISTRIBUTION OF MARKS ON THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS SHOWS A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF D AVERAGES AND A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF A AVERAGES THE LARGE GROUP REJECTED BY THE COLLEGE BECAUSE OF FAILURE ON THE EXAMINATION IS NOT INCLUDED 3 A COMPARISON OF THE SCHOOL AND EXAMINATION DISTRIBUTIONS SUGGESTS THAT A JOINT CONSIDERATION OF BOTH RECORDS IS A BETTER CRITERION THAN EITHER RECORD TAKEN SEPARATELY FOR PREDICTING A MANS ABILITY TO PERFORM COLLEGE WORK THE FIGURES IN TABLE I SHOW THAT THE AVERAGE RECORD ON THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION IS CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN THE AVERAGE RECORD IN COLLEGE THIS FINDING APPARENTLY CONFIRMS THE TENDENCY SHOWN BY MR LINCOLN ON OLD PLAN RECORDS AND INSERTED IN THE TABLE146 THE SCHOOL REVIEW FEBRUARY FOR PURPOSES OF COMPARISON IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT THE MEN PREPARED AT PRIVATE SCHOOLS OBTAINED ON THE AVERAGE POORER MARKS IN SCHOOL AND IN COLLEGE THAN MEN PREPARED AT PUBLIC SCHOOLS BUT THAT ON THE EXAMINATION THE TWO GROUPS WERE PRACTICALLY EQUAL IN ATTAINMENT THIS FACT WOULD LEAD ONE TO SUSPECT THAT THE SORT OF PREPARATION WHICH MET WITH SUCCESS ON ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS WAS NOT NECESSARILY THE SORT OF PREPARATION WHICH ENABLED MEN TO DO THEIR COLLEGE WORK BETTER THE WRITER HESITATES TO ATTACH GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO THIS FINDING BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERING SOCIAL AND ECO NOMIC FORCES WHICH

EXAMINATION STANDING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND EXAMINATION RECORDS UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVEEXAMINATION SYSTEM IS LOWER THAN UNDER THE OLD PLAN THIS TENDS TO INDICATE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE EXPERI ENCING GREATER DIFFICULTY IN PREPARING ADEQUATELY FOR THE NEWER TYPE OF EXAMINATION UNDER THE SYSTEM OF COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION AS HIGHER CORRELATION IS FOUND BETWEEN THE SCHOOL AND COLLEGE RECORDS THAN BETWEEN THE EXAMINATION AND COLLEGE RECORDS A SIMILAR SITUATION WAS REPORTED BY MR LINCOLN ON THE OLD PLAN RECORDS THE DIFFERENCES IN THESE CORRELATIONS ARE LESS UNDER THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION SYSTEM THAN UNDER THE OLD PLAN EXAMINATION SYSTEM1922 THE RELATIVE STANDING OF STUDENTS 147 THE HIGHEST CORRELATIONS SECURED IN THIS STUDY WERE THOSE OBTAINED BY AVERAGING THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL AND EXAMINATION RECORDS AND CORRELATING THESE AVERAGES WITH THE COLLEGE RECORDS HERE THE ATTEMPT WAS TO MEASURE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE NEW PLAN WHICH CONSIDERS BOTH THE SCHOOL RECORD AND THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION RECORD OF THE CANDIDATE CONCLUSION S THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY WOULD APPEAR TO INDICATE THE FOLLOWING I THE SCHOOL RECORD GIVES A SOMEWHAT BETTER INDICATION OF THE QUALITY OF WORK THAT MEN WILL DO IN COLLEGE THAN DOES THE RECORD ON THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATION 2 THE COMPREHENSIVE EXAMINATIONS ARE SUPERIOR TO THE OLD PLAN EXAMINATIONS IN DETERMINING FITNESS FOR COLLEGE 3 THE NEW PLAN OF ADMISSION IS PROBABLY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN EITHER THE SCHOOL RECORD OR THE COMPREHENSIVEEXAMINATION RECORD ALONE IN INDICATING NOT ONLY THE CANDIDATES ABILITY TO DO COLLEGE WORK BUT ALSO THE QUALITATIVE STANDARD OF HIS PREVIOUS SCHOLASTIC TRAINING AN EXAMINATION SYSTEM IMPOSES CERTAIN EVILS UPON THE SECONDARY SCHOOL THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE ARE A DOMINATION OVER THE SUBJECTMATTER AND METHOD OF THE WORK OF THE LAST YEAR AND A SUBORDINATION OF EDUCATIONAL AIMS TO THE IMMEDIATE OBJECTIVE OF THE EXAMINATION PROBABLY THESE EVILS ARE LESS PRONOUNCED WHERE CANDIDATES ARE PREPARING UNDER THE NEW PLAN THE RESULTS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE COLLEGE A MORE EXTENSIVE USE OF THE NEW PLAN OF ADMISSION IS DESIRABLE

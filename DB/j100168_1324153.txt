neygeneral on behalf of the state to restrain a public nuisance an individual who has sustained special damage may also obtain relief12 Another phase of this subject has been before the courts in the socalled liquor cases13 It was contended that statutes which made the selling of spirituous liquor indictable as a public nuisance and gave to every citizen irrespective of special damage the right to have such nuisance enjoined were unconstitutional As a general rule it is true equity will not intervene to prevent the commission of a crime as such4 but it will not refuse to pro tect public or property rights merely because the acts complained of happen to be criminals Nor can it be urged that these statutes deprive the defend ant of the right to trial by jury for the Constitution does not confer the right in cases where it did not exist previous to the adoption of the Consti tution6 Moreover since the granting of an injunction is not punishment within the meaning of the Constitution17 there is no question of double jeopardy involved18 A private citizen cannot abate a public nuisance for the destruction of property is a trespass even though it is being used for an ille gal purpose9 but the  liquor cases  are sound in holding that the state may empower individuals to enjoin a public nuisance as this in fact merely involves a matter of procedure20 THE EXTENT OF THE CLAIM NECESSARY FOR ADVERSE POSSESSION At common law a disseisee in addition to his right of entry which might be tolled by descent cast discontinuance or other cause could regain his land by a writ of entry or other form of real action It was against these forms of action that the first statutes of limitation were directed2 Since mere possession without actual disseisin would never toll the entry and force the true owner to resort to an action these old statutes could put title only in disseisors The statute of James4 on which the later statutes are based merely barred the right of entry after twenty years On its face therefore this statute would put title in any one against whom entry could have been made But the judges for many years required a disseisin to set this stat ute running5 probably because only disseisors had acquired rights by the former statutes This was nothing less than judicial legislation and was 12 Cook v Mayor etc tf Bath L R 6 Eq 177 13 Littleton v Fritz 65 Ia 488 14 Cope v

later courts have not adhered strictly to that requirement yet they have felt its influence and a study of the mod ern law of adverse possession needs reference to the old law of disseisin To a disseisin only a claim of freehold was necessary7 As to the claim now necessary under the statute and the rights resulting from the adverse possession of one claiming less than a fee there is no satisfactory authority In a recent case where the defendant claimed under a void lease it was held that by virtue of his possession for the statutory period he could not be ousted until the end of the term which the lease had attempted to give Warren Co v Lamkin 46 So 497 Miss The court did not consider the extent of the claim but followed a former sub silentio decision8 and over looked an earlier opposing dictum9 The defendant could not have been a disseisor for a termor is possessed not of the land but of his term  and a disseissin involves an ouster from the freehold1l And it has been held in the only other American cases on the point to be found that possession with a claim under a void lease as in the principal case will not satisfy the stat ute12 Again although where a life estate is claimed there may be a dis seissin18 possession under such a claim is not adverse14 But a claim of a life interest with a belief that the remainder is in another who is not the true owner is sufficient1 Such a claim does dispute the fee of the owner and those decisions can be reconciled with Justice Storys often cited dictum that the claim of a fee is necessary for adverse possession6 This technical rule seems to be generally accepted and indeed it has much in policy to commend it But the purpose of the statute to bar stale claims and so quiet title might be better satisfied if the claim of the termor or life tenant were held to be sufficiently adverse If it were so decided the question would arise as to the extent of the estate thereby acquired Estates of less duration than a fee may be gained under the statute when an adverse possessor claims against the tenant of a life estate since the remainderman has no right of entry until the termination of the particular estate17 Now a disseisor always acquired a fee regardless of the extent of his claim18 but such a rule gives a wrongdoer more than he claimed and operates harshly against a purchaser of the reversion It would be sounder and more equi table to give the possessor an estate commensurate with his claim with the remainder over to the true owner Despite the authority most of which is dicta much can be said therefore in support of the principal decision as more closely adhering to the spirit of the statute of limitations 6 See Ballantine Statute of Limitations 19 21 7 Co Lit I53 b I8i a 8 Brown v

EXTENSION DIVISION THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO I  SPSJCIAL ARTI aLtas MONT PELE FROM OCTOBER W10 1903 TO MAY 10 1904  THE publication in the daily papers of the statement that Mt Pele had Wcelebrated the second anniversary of the destruction of St Pierre by a heavy eruption has renewed popu lar interest in the volcano A few days before the appearance of this item the author re ceived from a correspondent in Dominica information that Mt Pele had been in serious  eruption on May 8 and had blown out the new ceIltral cone Inquiry at the office of the American Trading Co in this city elicited the statement that letters from their repre sentative in Martinique under date of May 11 made no mention of the volcano which would hardly have been the case had there been a great eruption Today copies of the Journal Officiet de ta SIartinique for May 10 to 20 have come to hand and the following quotation transla tion of the  Bulletins concernant le volcan  will be of interest May 4 to 6 1904

1903 the history of ZIont Pele has not been characterized by any very stelrtling events The dome which has formed the summit of the mountain since the famous spine or obelisk was destroyted in Au gust 1903 has suffered many minor changes in altitude and form which have altered its appearance entirely from what it was at the   Deglmllng The history of the dome as gathered from the Journa Ogiciel is as tfollows October 21 1903Loss of 5 m October 22Loss of 3 m October 25 Slight modifieations October 26 Additional modifieations October 29 The dome has suffered eertain ehanges its height has been stationary for sev eral days ATovember S The dome has suffered eertain modifieations of form without ehange in altitude November S A eonsiderable portion of the dome was blown off at 1134 AM November

iLprtl 25The summit of the dome has risen about 5 m since April 20 lliay 6 Slight loss of altitude May 10 Rise of 5 m since April 25 May 20Gain of about 5 m since May 10 Summarizing the foregoing notes there was a continual loss of altitude of the dome from October 19 to Decexnber 31 inclusivea with the exception of three days in November when the dome rose 4 m The net loss of altitude in this period appears to have been about 28 m The daily leulletins are unsatisfactory in that modifications are noted from time to time without any statelnent as to their char acter On January 3 Professor Giraud reports the important fact that the remains of the great obelisk which towered above the volcano in the early part of 1903 were again rising with reference to the rernainder of the new cone The daily reports from that time on say nothing further however with regard to the spine A period of elevation set in with the beginning of January 1904 with a rise of 6 m during the first eight days of the year Then for eleven weeks the altitude rernained stationary except for a loss of 3 m during the first week in March With the 27th of March the rise seems to have become nearly continuous and arnounted to 29 m in eight weeks to May 20 giving a net gain of 32 m since January first Whether this applies to the summit of the new spine which was reported rising early in January or not the losses which took place in the altitude of the mountain during the last months of 1903 were regained during the first five months of the present year The activity of the volcano which was so great during September 1903 as to seem to threaten a frstclass eruptionn gradually di minished during the last quarter of the year and there have been apparently few note worthy outbursts to chronicle during the past our or five months Few days however pass without clouds of steam rising from the crater accompanied frorn tirne to tirne by dustflows down the gorge to the Riviere Blanche to the southwest or across the basin of the Lac des Palrnistes to the east EDzaUND OTIS HOVEY AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL IIISTORY NEW YOBE June 11 1904

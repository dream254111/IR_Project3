missionary enterprise of the nineteenth century was strongly paternalistic in spirit Today the oriental Christians are making a sharp distinction between Western culture and Christianity The former they criticize and distrust There is an insistent demand for religious selfdetermination Wise leaders of the missionary enterprise are urging a larger measure of native initiative This movement means a radical change in the philosophy and the adminis tration of missions but this change is imperative if the good will of Eastern peoples is to be secured and a real Asiatic Christianity produced Some of us grew up with a picture of Queen Victoria which is very typical of her era She stands surrounded by her ministers who look on with approval as she hands a large Bible to an African potentate And he adoringly accepts it on bended knee as she utters the amazing words This is the secret of Englands greatness Famous words of one era sometimes become infamous in the next and today we gasp at the lack of taste which could have painted such a scene and the lack of humor which could give it such a title More astounding stillin spite of an Africa reeling under the white mans burden and an Asia which sees our naked ness uncoveredthis picture and this appeal are still used as a potent missionary motive It is still admired as it hangs for instance in the study of Sir George Williams founder of the Young Mens Christian Association and I have seen it used several times in missionary addresses Let me confess even in talks to the troops in France in the Great War I used it myself till its details came home with a shock to me Who are these men who stand about the Queen in knee breeches and smug approval Lord Shaftesbury one recognizes grim and determined so far certainly the picture might be a IIn Darkest Africa was a book typical of the nineteenth century In Darkest Christendom is now in its third large edition 466THE PASSING OF PATERNALISM IN MISSIONS 467 little justified for he was nerved by the Bible to fight with his back to the wall for the very life of Englands children against the Moloch of industrialism But with him are men who were exploiting India through the East India Company and others who had forced China in one lackhumor treaty to accept opium and the missionaries of the Cross A great hymn on its glorythe glory of sacrificial lovewas just then written as its author was bombarding Tientsin and one remembers the great evangelist Newton of an earlier generation singing pietistic hymns on the deck of his ship as the slaves groaned below him at the oar The secret of Englands greatness and yet there is some truth in itfor a minority in England had won the country to set free her slaves and Lord Shaftes bury had won his fight for the children and England had sent out missionaries as well as opium and had freed Europe as well as herself from the tyranny of Napoleon It is not for us to condemn yet we may accept the fact that the Victorian era great in so many ways was tinged with patronage and heavy with paternalism unconscious of its own weakness And the missionary motive and methods of that great era could hardly fail to suffer accordingly missionaries went out from motives of pity rather than of respect Fortunately Africa and Asia did not much resent the patronage at the time The greatness of pioneers like Livingstone Carey and Morrison made an immense impres sion and it was reinforced by the glamor of our Western civilization till these lands looked to us as supermen the secret of whose greatness they eagerly desired to know Now all this is changed They know that few white men are like these giants that our civilization is almost impotent to cure itself of grievous diseases that we have used the Bible as it suited our convenience If you were at all like the Sermon on the Mount or even like the prophetic ideals of Israel Asia would fall down before your Godthat is Asias deliberate judgment as she has got468 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION to know us better and today Mr Gandhis revulsion from all things Western is symptomatic It is not a revulsion from Christhis Sermon on the Mount is its charteror even from Christianity but from Christendom her failures of conduct her very standards of success are anathema to this spiritual giant And the common people hear him gladly they are akin to him Asia is unconsciously nearer to the Sermon on the Mount than we This reaction is nowhere more vital than in the ranks of the Asiatic Christian churches Admiring Christ they dislike much of our Christianity and they repudi ate firmly and yet with surpassing gentleness our right to dominate and control The gentleness is there because they are gentle by nature and good Christians and because they owe us so much the firm resolve is there because their soul is their own and must grow in its own way And so one hears everywhere the cry an Indian church a Japanese church a Chinese church  and even an African church Now the best missionaries are sympathetic even if they do not see just what this cry of the soul means and how it is to express itself in action certainly the younger spirits ought to understand But some perhaps the majority think it rather ungracious and they find it difficult to believe that they can take their hand off the levers Will the machine they have so painfully built up work if they do What will hap pen to the efficiency they have so hardly introduced Now to hasten up this process of devolution is the main problem before the missions of today To face it and other great and vital issues some three thousand students of Britain set themselves very courageously in February 1921 and in the fall of the same year the missionary leaders of Protestant ism met at Lake Mohonk with some of the strongest repre sentatives of the indigenous churches of Asia and Africa x At the Glasgow Conference where Viscount Grey gave the opening address and showed how Christianity was challenged and how our civilization had received its ultimatumTHE PASSING OF PATERNALISM IN MISSIONS 469 Their deliberations were of extraordinary interest and signifi cance dealing with such grave topics as the future of the work of German missionary societies the control of labor in East Africa international cooperation in mission service and many others But no topic of graver importance came before them than that of the relations of church and mission the whole future of Christianity in Asia and perhaps in the world may depend upon the efficiency with which this problem is handled It is clear from the findings of these leaders that they at any rate are on the right track They advocate in temperate language as one would expect measures which are in many ways revolutionary Some of these measures have been advocated for a long time by some of us younger and more radical missionaries eg that the foreign worker should be placed under the direction of a wise native leader that these leaders should be consulted as to the number and qualifica tions of foreign workers to be sent out as to the expenditure of funds from abroad and as to the training of the foreign missionary All of this has for long seemed obvious to many of us who believe in selfdetermination and realize that nothing else will work yet as these wise leaders know it is going to be a hard task to get them put into practice at the home base of some missions and upon the field where the majority alike of foreign missionaries and native converts have grown up in a different tradition You are my mother and my father that is a familiar eulogy of the foreign missionary it may become his epitaph During the first stages of his great task he is of necessity the father of his small and help less flock They look to him for help in a thousand ways and the stronger man he is the more he interprets his task as one of allround helpfulness He is a servant of the Lord of all good life and his gospel must meet human need at a thousand points The burden of his task is at once his cross and his crown he enjoys carrying it and the very helpless ness of his people stirs that paternal instinct that is so strong470 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION in most of us His own children are thousands of miles away across the ocean less real and less dependent upon him than these begotten in the Spirit He is in fact like many a mother efficient and bustling as a broody hen How shocked she would be if Madame Montessori took her in hand Let the little fumbling fingers alone It is easier to do things for them but it is also much more selfish Now even in what is called the paternal stage of foreign missions a Montessori voice has been heard from time to time Your methods are efficient but unChristian Let these people walk without crutches or you do them irreparable harm You are indispensable You have no business to be Such voices have often given offense it is hard to be criticized in your most efficient moments and the old missionary will patiently point to the listlessness of his people and their dependence upon him Exactly says the critic no man is interested in what he does not help to create You old popes of the mission field remind me of the benevolent ele phant Let me be a mother to you she said as she sat down upon the nestling partridges Now if this mothering is oppressive to the nestling it is stifling when he wants to fly In the second stage of missions now reached by very many of the Asiatic churches there is a widespread sense of oppression and of want of air Loyal to their spiritual fathers they yet resent much in them that savors of the heavy uncle Adolescence is no doubt the period of loyalty it is quite as much that of disloyalty Grateful for much therefore the young churches are eager to shake off their leadingstrings And of course the best missionaries are united in trying to speed up this process I remember two great sermons on this theme one to schoolboys in Ceylon upon the text Let every tub stand on its own bottom The studious youths searched their Bibles in vain and their missionary teachers were amused but some at any rate learned that the sermon was aimed as much at them asTHE PASSING OF PATERNALISM IN MISSIONS 471 at their pupils The other sermon was that of a negro lawyer to the students at Hampton Institute Boys and girls stand on your own feet The good Lord has sure given you big ones and flat ones stand on them These texts are surely good Christianity and every intelligent missionary will say that this is what he is working for but that to stand alone takes time that to walk is an even slower process and that the native church must walk before it can run The transition then to the elder brother attitude has been painfully slow Where the missionarys whole heart is in the noble task of decreasing in order that his converts may increase this process of devolution goes on apace but still more speed is needed Just a hundred years after Morrison went to China the great missionary conference at Shanghai faced the problems of the common task and legislated upon even such intimate topics as that of ancestorworship There were no Chinese present When they meet this year the Chinese will form 50 per cent of the total conference In Korea selfsupporting selfgoverning and selfpropagating churches are the order of the day a few missionaries may attend the synods as visitors or as wise elder brothers called into conference but the church is on its own feetand this among a people usually called inefficient So in a lesser degree with other Asiatic churches The Chinese ordained ministry has more than doubled in the past ten years while the missionary force has only increased 50 per cent and the Indian churches have given a lead to the whole world in their resolute and wise steps toward union Yet the process must be speeded up It clearly will not do for the Christian church to fall behind the lead given by the secular authorities In India for example the British government has in the past decade done more toward the devolution of authority than the Christian  This article was written before the Shanghai conference of 1922 which demon strated the truth of its main contentions472 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION church and one result is that strong men of the Indian Christian community are proud to be government servants but feel that they cannot keep their respect in the employment of the missionary bodies This is not mainly a financial but a spiritual problem It is striking for example to see how throughout Asia one finds quoted as strong examples of Asiatic Christianity Young Mens Christian Association secretaries who find in this organization it would seem a freer atmosphere and an absence of foreign control which they have missed in other forms of Christian work and even more striking to see the brilliant men who join the Servants of India Society and the National Missionary Society at what is barely a living wage They value freedom more than money Let me disarm impatience by pointing out that after all theirs is the spirit of youth all over the world The success of the Student Movement perhaps the most significant of the auxiliary movements of the church is largely due to the absence of paternalism in it and in England at any rate to its democratic organization Similarly the Labor Movement is quite as much a revolt against patronage as against exploita tion it is a demand for partnership and all women in their newfound emancipation will sympathize with the revolt of the young churches against their founders At the great World Conference in Edinburgh in 910o Bishop Azariah a brilliant and temperate spokesman of Indian Christianity shamed us all by his cry of protest I owe all I am to mission aries but I feel that too many of you have promised us a golden throne in Heaven but denied us a bamboo chair in the porch Since that date the growth of the national movement in intensity has had its influence upon the Indian Christian community and frank and outspoken criticism is the order of the day In Japan the brilliant converts to Chris tianity from the start men of influential position and with the traditions of a ruling class soon took the reins into their own hands and yet when one examines missionary work amongTHE PASSING OF PATERNALISM IN MISSIONS 473 this brilliant people one cannot but feel that in secular things where the Japanese have been free of foreign control or free to get rid of their foreign teachers they have made more progress than in this realm where their native courtesy and gratitude have kept them from what would seem a brutal frankness Behind their patient courtesy is often a deep re sentment Even in China there is a great deal of impatience especially among the young educated men and a demand that the Chinese church be left free to expand and grow in its own way Lest I be misunderstood let me add to all this that my Asiatic friends even the bluntest and most outspoken do not desire a complete withdrawal of missionary agencies they know that these are still needed they realize that their countries need Christ no less than the rest of the world and merely to evangelize their millions is a colossal task But they are horrified at such indiscriminate and wholesale recruit ing movements as that instituted by the Interchurch World Movement Quality and not quantity is what we want they say give us men and women who are experts in social service in literary work in medicine rather than raw recruits above all let us choose people with the right spirit and quali fications and let us help to train them These are practical suggestions of very farreaching impor tance If the findings of the Mohonk Conference are to be carried out it must be by a very humble and thoughtful application of democratic principles by a revolution in our attitude to financial control by free and full trust of Asiatic Christianity It is intolerable that many of our mission boards are still victims of the old pagan adage He who pays the piper calls the tune To keep control in spiritual things merely because one has the purse is a form of Prussianism and there is a great deal of talk about pauperizing the Asiatic Christians which is hypocrisy Relatively speaking most of them give far more toward their churches than we Christians474 THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION of the West and in many cases where the experiment has been made of trusting them with the administration of funds raised outside the country they have shown themselves not only trustworthy but often very able administrators Moreover it is obvious that the Asiatic churches should do their own recruiting we foreigners who wish to help them should go at their invitation not at the bidding of the mission ary boards and the spirit of youth being what it is the noblest and most generous and therefore most fitted to be missionaries will respond to an Asiatic challenge more readily than to that of the Old Guard of the Christian church in the West or even to that of young and ardent missionaries on furlough I have much personal experience to show that this is so anyone who was at the Des Moines Student Conference will remember how that great multitude thrilled to the appeal of their fellow students from other lands and how impatient they were at much of the heavy artillery At Oxford and Cambridge some years ago the finest British missionaries had appealed in vain for recruits a month later an Indian leader by his simple appeal Come and help us recruited eight firstclass honors men on the spot and this has happened more than once For this resentment of paternalism and patronage is a deepseated instinct of our time And this leads on If Asia is to recruit its own helpers it must be as younger brothers if the recruits are young as elder brothers not uncles if they are wellknown experts For such Asia has a warm and humble welcome When Haskell lecturers or a John Dewey or a James Hope Moulton go out they are received with open arms and Asia sits at their feet and they are always wise enough to show that they have come to learn as well as to teach I have been told that it will be very difficult to recruit American and British students with their love of freedom to work under Asiatic leaders This is a lie based upon a mis understanding young America and young Britain love free dom too much to desire to see others denied it and the greatTHE PASSING OF PATERNALISM IN MISSIONS 475 mass of our students today are in favor of selfdetermination all along the line and most of all within the Christian church What then is needed most urgently if the findings of the leaders are to take effect is the fearless application of them to the practice of the Boards and of their representatives on the field and in the majority of cases it is a revolution that is needed Nor is this surprising in a world undergoing recon struction It is indeed unthinkable that the Christian church needs no radical rebuilding and the revolution indicated seems to me nothing but an application of her Masters principles to methods which may have been justified in the nineteenth century and were indeed almost unavoidable in the first few decades but which are now largely out of date and out of touch with the spirit of our time

j100602,The Journal of the Royal Geographical Society of London,1798378,Observations on the Water of Wick,i303896,23V CLEGHORN on thG Water of Wict In order better to know what is the real body of water dx3rived frorn the two first of the foregoing valleys by tile Arve itself I took separate measurements of its only important tributaries  the Gifire from the valley of Sixt tlle Menoge from the valley of Boege and the Borne from the valley of the Bornands at a time when the level of the whole Arve ne1r Caroure was 0 77 metres and its solume 298 cubic metres 10520 cubic feet per second The body of the Menoge was found 1 9 metres 57 cubic feet and tle Borne 4 7 metres 166 cutic feet in a second Lastly and on the satne day the 24th of July I took very accurate measurenlents lxf the GifEre at Marigny 2 kilometles above its confluence with the Arve dividing its wet crosssection into nine separate parts of whicll I measured the width the depth and the rapidity I found the whole width of the river 34 metres or 1115 feet its greatest rapidity 2 2 metres 72 feet in a second the surface of its uet crosssection 19 7 square metres and its produce 36 52 cubic metres in a second or l 289 cubic feet If I take from the body of the Arve at Carouge 298 cubic metres or 10520 cubic feet thse sum of its three tributariesthe Giffire the Borne and the Me nogetogether 4312 cubic mbtres l512 cubic fbet I find the body of the mairl branch the collected waters of the valleys of Chamounix and Montjoie is 908 cubic feet or 255 cubic metres in a second  S   XtI Observations orl the Water of GicA BY JOHN LEGHORN Communicated by Sir RODERICK I ZIURCflISON Read June 22 18 57 I ENCLOSE a plan of our Bay made in 1814 Yeu will observe tllat tile sand is a11 on the south side of the river and that Pulteney town Harbour has been built on this sandheap The south side of the Bay is the shallow or sandy side the north the deep side Below the sand there is a vast accumulation of large boulder3 called on the plan  North Odd c South Odd rhese boulders form an incoherent pavement partially covered with sand On the north side there is a larger area occupied by them and freer from sand than on the south side Every puS of wind moves the salld the boulders are set in luotion by storms only but like the sand they too are travelling to the south side of tbe Bay In the cllaracter of the stranded blocks on eacil side of the Bay there is a marked difference Those orl the north side under thf3 influence of high springtides only are nearly all anular and have beell torn trom the edge3 of the sunketl ledges that margin its side but on the SOIlth side the stranded boulders are nearly all svatelworn sitnilar to those forlning tlle i lNorth axld South OddCLEGHORN on the Water of Wick 231 On the north the stranded blocks are all black and this black coating is of vegetable rxlatter showing that they are at com parative rest but on the south side the boulders are naked and chafedX rhey are not at rest 1housands of tons of waterworn naked and chafed boulxlers are lying in a vast heap at the back of the south quay and in the sheltered reaches farther out in the bay there are large masses between the quay heads there are numbers and for many years past huge boulders in great numbers have every rear been re moved from the fairway To keep Pulteneytown Harbour coxnparatively clear of sancl and bouldeI3 unremitting attexltion is reqllired from the harbour authorities anll much money is yearly expended When Captain Washington was hele in 1849 I poir1ted out to hiitl soine of the evils that assail the harbour and so cogent were they in his estimation that he reccmmended Government to grant lOOOOI for the Impr0vernent of the RIVER MOUth See Captain AVashingtons Report It would be well if we could satisfactlrily answer the questions Wrhy does the sand accumulate on the south side of the Bay and why do the boulders tend to that side Why is the north side the deep side and the south the shallow or sarldy side of the Bay  Ve may be helped to a solution of these questions by looking at the condition of the other bays on the coast Now I observe that in Sinclair Bay the north side is the deep side and the south the shallow or sandy side The same is true of Lybster Latheron wheel Dunbeath c and the sand in these inlets is all on the south side of their streams Of the tIoray Firth too the north side is the deep side and the south side its sandy or shallow side The same is tIue of the Firths of Tay and ForthS and is it not true of every fil ll and bay on the east ccast of Britain  To svhat law is this owing  I have looked into the register of the winds kept at the harbour office here and find that our prevailing winds are from the SE I have observed too that the drift seaweed is carried to WINDWARD may not sand and boulders under water obey the same law Qur civil engineers seem not to have re cognised this law or if tizy did they expected by their works to nullify it They have not been sllecessful M7e have to thank you for tellillg TIS where the boulders and anular blocks came fronl and the who3e thing is now plain Our river drains a valley of Till and our bay is its terminus Tbe Till in Caithness is found in deep  oldredsand3tone  gorges on each side of ourbay it is now found in high banks on the sea   Till  is the name in Scotland for those coarse accumulatiolls of mud and pebbles with oceasioIlal blocks of stone which have been found in the sea of the glacial period232 MACDONALD on the Expeditio7 side and thins of as we recede from it and in the bottom of the bay and in the rivers bed it is of great depth The open space between the high banks of the bay and river must then have been occuted by the Till The centre of the valley has been washed a7vay by the sea and river and in the boulders brming the  North and SOUth Odd we have the coarser portions of the rill tlle riddlings of the vast excavation rhat this is the correct view uTill appear now clear when I tell you that from the bridge of AVick to the Loch of Arattin there is not in OUr rivers bed a boulder worth speaking of svhile in the  Burn of Haster which has made deep cuttings in the Till and is a mere tributary to our river its channel is strewed with boulders This shows that while the large volume of our river has been strong enough to remove the clay and bo2clders the burn has had force to remose the CLAY ONLY From the phenomena our bay presents I think it must be in ferlesl tilat Pulteneytown Harbour is in the very worst position and that any extension of the harbour on the south side of the bay must end in disappointment to all concerned XI1IPoccedings of tAte Erpedition for the Exploration of the Rewa River and its Tributaries in La Viti Levu Fiji Islands BY JOHN DENIS MACDONALD Esq AssistantSurgeon of H M S  Herald Captain N M Denham Communicated by Capt WASEINGTON RN FRGs Hydrographer Reced June 22 1857 ON Friday morning 15th August 18D6 our little party consisting of the Rev Samuel Waterhouse AQVesleyan missionary Mr Milne botanical collector Joseph Dagwell leadin seaman and mtrself sailed out of Levuka harbour in the cutter with a fair wind fot Mbau On entering the Ndaveta levu or large passage letween Na Eauzambu and the southern extremity of Moturiki as it happened to be low water we landed upon the reef projecting from the latter island to examine a remarkable coral rock called  Ai Vaka Tangka ni Saisai Every part of this rock bears evi dence of great antiquity It is honeycombed and worn by atmospheric agency and the action of the sea burro7ved by all the various perforating animals and riven into two principal portions by a wide vertical fissure Reference to the specimens detached from it show that the closeness alld density of its texture  See Capt Worths Paper Naut Mag 1852 also Appendix Journal of the Boyal Geograph Soc vol xxiED

in con sidering a Kansas Statute that allowed a reasonable attorney fee to a suc cessful plaintiff in an action against a railriad company for damages from fire caused by operating the railroad upheld the statute as being in the nature of a police regulation Atchison T  S F R Co v Matthezvs 174 U S 96 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  MECHANICS LIEN STATUTE  ALLOWING ATToR NEYS FREsWhere plaintiff in recovering a judgment claimed the bene fit of a Florida statute which provides that the plaintiff in a suit to enforce a mechanics or materialmans lien if successful shall recover an attor neys fee regardless of whether or not he recovers the amount sued for held such statute is unconstitutional as denying to defendants in such suits the equal protection of the laws Union Terminal Co v Turner Con str Co C C A 5th Circ 247 Fed 727 The United States Supreme Court in Missouri K  T R Co v Cade 233 U S 642 has recently upheld the provision of a Texas statute for the al lowance of a reasonable attorneys fee of not over 20 to the successful plaintiff in a suit in which an attorney is actually employed upon a claim not exceeding 200 against any corporation or person for various sorts of claims where the recovery is for the full amount claimed this statute mak ing no classification of debtors and not appearing to have been made for purpose of bearing against any class of citizens But a classification of debtors may be made if there is some reasonable basis for the classifica tion Thus attorneys fees have been allowed against railway companies for damages from fire caused by operating the railroad the provision being in the nature of a police regulation Atchison T  S Ry Co v Matthews 174 U S 96 In Seaboard Air Line Ry Co v Seegers 207 U S 73 an attorneys fee was allowed against a railway for the purpose of securing the prompt payment of small claims on the ground that the matter for ad justment is peculiarly one within the knowledge of the carrier which can determine the amount of the loss more accurately and promptly than any one else But the amount recovered must be the amount claimed St Louis I M  S Ry Co v Wynne 224 U S 354 Seaboard Air Line R Co v Seegers supra It has been held to the contrary Mobile  Ohio R Co v Brandon 98 Miss 46I A state statute allowing attorneys fees against insurance companies which fail to make prompt payment of claims has been upheld Pacific Mutual Life Ins Co v Carter 92 Ark 378 In several jur isdictions the courts have held invalid statutes allowing attorneys fees to successful plaintiffs in suits to foreclose mechanics liens Randolph v Builders  Painters Supply Co IO6 Ala 50I Mannix v Tryon 152 Cal 3I Davidson v Jennings 27 Colo I87 Atkinson v Woodmansee 68 Kan 7I Brubaker v Bennett I9 Utah 40I On the contrary such provisions have been held valid in Gray v New Mexico P Stone Co I5 N M 478 Title Guarantee Co v Wrenn 35 Or 62 and in numerous other jurisdictions The question has not come up directly before the Supreme Court of the United States nor has it been passed upon in any other Federal Court The Court 639MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW in the instant case held the statute invalid in that it allowed an attorneys fee though the claim asserted is an excessive one and on this ground it seems that such is the proper holding and that the decision is in accordance with the views so far expressed by the United States Supreme Court on the subject St Louis I M  S Ry Co v Wynne supra Seaboard Air Line Co v Seegers supra CONTRACTSEXISTING LEGAL OBLIGATION AS CONSIDERATIONDefendant had leased premises for a term of five years beginning 1912 at the rate of 134 per month In 1914 he found it difficult to pay his rent and was often in arrears Consequently plaintiff the lessor agreed to cut the rent to 75 per month and accepted this amount monthly for a year He then insisted on the original 134 but finally agreed to accept Ioo per month The lease having been terminated the lessor now sues to recover the dif ference between the monthly sums of 75 and later ioo actually paid and the stipulated 134 Held plaintiff could not recover Brackett  Co v Lof gren Minn I918 167 N W 274 This case involved again the struggle between precedent and practicality in respect to consideration Doing what one is already legally bound to do is not accepted by courts generally as consideration for a promise The court in the principal case cites a long line of cases    holding that payment by the debtor and receipt by the creditor of a part of a li quidated demand is not a satisfaction of the whole although the creditor agrees to accept it as such While the courts persistently repeat this rule they as consistently criticize it and avoid its application wherever possible See 14 MICH L REV 480 I6 ID I80 and authorities cited in the principal case The rule applies to cases in which the obligation is a debt already owing Bunge v Koop 48 N Y 225 Leeson v Anderson 99 Mich 247 and to those where the obligation is the duty to perform some act Foxworthy v Adams I36 Ky 403 Schriner v Craft I66 Ala 446 But the principal case holds that it does not apply when the new promise itself as well as the existing obligation has been performed that is to say when the new agreement has been executed on both sides To utilize this exception the court must have treated the agreement of 1914 as a new contract to lease the property for 75 in substitution for the original lease There is noth ing to indicate that the parties intended more than the simple agreement to accept 75 in lieu of I34 dueexcept the desire of the court to avoid the rule There is exact precedent cited however Compare Hastings v Lovejoy 140 Mass 261 CONTRACTS  PROMISE TO CONTINUE SALARY 0f EMPLOYEE ENLISTING IN SERvIEDefendant District Council issued a circular to

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1076797,EDITORIAL NOTES,I244617,EDITORIAL NOTES IT SEEMS TO BE QUITE THE FASHION AT THE PRESENT TIME IN CERTAIN CIRCLES TO CRY COLLEGE DOMINATION OF THE LOWER SCHOOLS NO EDUCATIONAL GATHERING SEEMS TO BE QUITE COMPLETE UNLESS SOMEONE SOUNDS THE OMI WHAT IS MEANT NOUS NOTE AND VIGOROUS APPLAUSE GREETS SUCH SELFSTYLED BY COLLEGE CHAMPIONS OF THE CAUSE OF THE OPPRESSED FOR THE LAST FEW DOMINATION YEARS SINCE THIS SHIBBOLETH BEGAN TO BE SO FREQUENT I HAVE BEEN MUCH INTERESTED IN STUDYING SPEECHES AND WRITINGS CONTAINING IT TO DISCERN JUST WHAT IS MEANT BY THE DENUNCIATION I CONFESS THAT I HAVE FAILED TO LEARN THIS EDITORIAL IS WRITTEN IN THE HOPE THAT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS OF SUCH DOMINATION WILL PUT THESE INDICTMENTS INTO SOME CONCRETE STATEMENTS IN ORDER THAT THE WORLD MAY KNOW OF ANY EXISTING TYRANNY IT IS TRUE THAT SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE MODIFIED THEIR COURSES IN ORDER THAT THEIR STUDENTS MIGHT ENTER COLLEGE BUT THE COLLEGES OUGHT SCARCELY TO BE BLAMED FOR THIS THE MAIN STIMULUS TO THE MARVELOUS GROWTH OF SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAS BEEN THE DESIRE TO GO TO COLLEGE ANNIHILATE THE COLLEGES AND THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS WOULD DWINDLE GREATLY FOR WANT OF INCEN TIVES IT IS PRESUMABLE THAT HIGHSCHOOL AUTHORITIES KNOW BETTER THAN COLLEGE AUTHORITIES WHAT HIGHSCHOOL BOYS WISH TO STUDY CAN STUDY TO ADVAN TAGE AND WHAT A GIVEN COMMUNITY NEEDS CONSEQUENTLY THE HIGH SCHOOLS IMPOSE CERTAIN QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE CONDITIONS FOR ENTRANCE TO THE HIGH SCHOOL IF THIS IS REGARDED AS UNJUST DOMINATION OF THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS BY THE HIGH SCHOOLS I HAVE YET TO HEAR OF IT IS IT NOT LIKEWISE REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT COLLEGE AUTHORITIES KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE THE CAPACITIES AND NEEDS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS IF SO OUGHT THEY NOT TO DETERMINE THE CURRICULUM FOR THE COLLEGE OR TECHNICAL SCHOOL AND ALSO THE PREREQUISITES FOR ENTRANCE THERETO IF HIGH SCHOOLS THEN SHAPE THEIR COURSES SO THAT SOME AMBITIOUS BOYS AND GIRLS CAN PREPARE FOR COLLEGE SHOULD THE COLLEGES BE BRANDED AS TYRANNICAL MOST ASSUREDLY THE COLLEGES IN MAKING THEIR OWN CURRICULA SHOULD CAREFULLY STUDY THE ACTUAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE HIGH SCHOOLS AND PLACE THE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS WITHIN REACH OF THE AVERAGE STUDENT JUST THE SAME AS THE HIGH SCHOOLS MUST ADJUST THEIR WORK TO THAT ACCOMPLISHED IN THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL BECAUSE THE ELEMENTARY AND HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE THE SAME GENERAL SUPER VISION THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL HAS BEEN CAREFULLY STUDIED AND THE ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN REASONABLY MADE IS IT NOT ALSO TRUE THAT THE COLLEGES HAVE MADE A VERY CONSIDERABLE ATTEMPT TO ADJUST THE WORK OF THE COLLEGE TO THAT OF THE SECONDARY SCHOOL WITNESS THIS IN THE LATITUDE ALLOWED IN THE RANGE OF SUBJECTS WHICH COUNT FOR ADMISSION THE OPPORTUNITY FOR ELECTION WITHIN THIS WIDE RANGE OF POSSIBILITIES AND IN THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM SO LARGELY IN VOGUE AND SO RAPIDLY SPREADING AT THE PRESENT TIME MANUALTRAINING WORK TYPE 503THE SCHOOL REVIEW WRITING COMMERCIAL SUBJECTS DRAWING MUSIC SHOPWORK FORGING AND ALMOST EVERY CONCEIVABLE SUBJECT MAY BE OFFERED AS ENTRANCE SUBJECTS TO PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT AS SOON AS ANY SUBJECT INTRODUCED IN THE HIGH SCHOOL CAN BE SHOWN TO BE WELL TAUGHT IT WILL BE ACCEPTED AS A COLLEGEENTRANCE SUBJECT I WONDER IF THE FULL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM HAS BEEN CLEARLY SEEN BY THOSE WHO CRY COLLEGE DOMINATION THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM THE IS INTENDED TO GIVE ENTIRE LATITUDE TO HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS IN SIGNIFICANCE THEIR METHODS OF TEACHING WITHIN LIMITS HIGHSCHOOL TEACH OF THE ACCREDITED ERS ALSO HAVE THE SOLE DETERMINATION OF WHAT PARTS OF A SUB SYSTEM JECT SHALL BE TAKEN OR EMPHASIZED UNDER THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM A TEACHER MAY GIVE HIS OWN EXAMINATIONS AND BE THE SOLE JUDGE OF THE FITNESS OF THE STUDENT TO BE PASSED FROM A SUBJECT IF A HIGHSCHOOL PUPIL IS PASSED IN A SUBJECT THE COLLEGE GIVES FULL CREDIT FOR WHATEVER THE TEACHER CERTIFIES I OFTEN WONDER WHAT HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS WOULD THINK IF THE COLLEGES SHOULD ALL SUDDENLY RETURN TO THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM FOR ENTRANCE I FANCY THAT THERE WOULD BE A GREAT OUTCRY FROM THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS AGAINST IT THE OBJECTION WOULD COME NOT BECAUSE OF THE FEAR THAT EXAMINATIONS COULD NOT BE PASSED BUT BECAUSE OF THE NARROWING AND DEMORALIZING INFLU ENCE OF SHAPING ALL SCHOOL WORK TO THE EXPECTED EXAMINATIONS THE PERUSAL OF EDUCATIONAL MAGAZINES PUBLISHED BUT A FEW YEARS AGO BEFORE THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM DISCLOSES THE BITTERNESS WITH WHICH THE EXAMI NATION SYSTEM FOR COLLEGE ENTRANCE WAS DENOUNCED THE ATTACKS CAME FROM THE LOWER SCHOOLS MAINLY AND NOT FROM THE COLLEGES IT WAS BECAUSE OF THE DISSATISFACTION WITH THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM DISPLAYED BY THE LOWER SCHOOLS THAT THE COLLEGES INAUGURATED THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM TO GIVE A MORE NATURAL AND RATIONAL RELATION BETWEEN THE COLLEGES AND THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM CAME FROM GERMANY ITS FIRST DEVELOPMENT IN THIS COUNTRY WAS IN MICHIGAN I AM UNABLE TO TRACE THE OFFICIAL STEPS TAKEN FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SYSTEM IN ALL OF THE DIFFERENT STATES BUT FOR ONE STATE I HAVE DEFINITE RECORDS SHOWING THAT THE MOVEMENT FIRST STARTED IN A SCHOOLMASTERS CLUB THE PUBLICSCHOOL OFFICIALS PREPARING A MEMORIAL TO THE STATE UNIVERSITY ASKING THAT AN ACCREDITED SYSTEM AND INSPECTION BE ESTAB LISHED IN THE EAST IT IS CERTAIN THAT THE COLLEGES ARE THE CONSERVATIVE ONES IN ABOLISHING THE EXAMINATION SYSTEM AND SUBSTITUTING THE ACCREDITED SYSTEM THE SECONDARY SCHOOL OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN THE SUPPLIANTS WHEN A HIGH SCHOOL IS PLACED UPON THE ACCREDITED LIST OF THE STATE UNI VERSITY OF IOWA THE INITIATIVE IS TAKEN BY THE SCHOOL AUTHORITIES IN ALL CASES THE UNIVERSITY NEVER SEEKS THE PRIVILEGE OF INSPECTING AND INITIATION IN ACCREDITING BUT UNDERTAKES THIS FUNCTION ONLY UPON INVITA THE SECONDARY TION IT MAY BE OF INTEREST TO KNOW THAT THE NUMBER OF SCHOOL REQUESTS ON THE WAITING LIST IS USUALLY LARGE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF DIRECT INQUIRY AND MORE OBSERVATION LEADS ME TO FIRMLY BELIEVE 504THAT MOST COMMUNITIES AND TEACHERS EAGERLY SEEK SUCH RELATION EVIDENTLY BELIEVING IT TO THEIR ADVANTAGE ANY COMMUNITY IS ABSOLUTELY FREE TO ABAN DON THE RELATIONS AT ANY TIME BUT TO MY KNOWLEDGE NO COMMUNITY IN THIS OR ANY OTHER STATE HAS SOUGHT TO HAVE THE RELATIONS DISSOLVED TO SECURE A PLACE ON THE ACCREDITED LIST OF THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIA TION OF COLLEGES AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS THE INITIATIVE IS ALSO TAKEN BY THE SECONDARY SCHOOL NO HIGH SCHOOL IS OBLIGED TO CONTINUE ON THE LIST AND AT ANY TIME WHEN IT IS DEEMED ADVANTAGEOUS IT MAY WITHDRAW THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO DOMINATION BY THIS ASSOCIATION IN THE WAY OF REQUIRING A CERTAIN KIND OF TEACHERS EQUIPMENT OR INSTRUCTION IN ANY SCHOOL IN THE COUNTRY OF COURSE IF A SCHOOL WISHES TO HAVE THE ADVANTAGE WHICH COMES FROM BEING ON THE LIST THEN THE REGULATIONS OF THE ASSOCIATION HAVE TO BE COMPLIED WITH BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS PURELY VOLUNTARY ON THE PART OF THE SCHOOL THOSE WHO ARE CONVERSANT WITH THE AFFAIRS OF THE ASSOCIATION KNOW THAT THE LIST OF THOSE DESIRING AND ASKING A PLACE IS ALWAYS LARGE THOSE WHO DENOUNCE THE ASSOCIATION AS A TRUST ARE USUALLY THE ONES WHO ASK MOST LOUDLY BUT FAIL TO BE ADMITTED SOME ARGUE FOR SYSTEMS OF INSPECTION AND ACCREDITING BY THE STATE DE PARTMENTS OF EDUCATION THROUGH THE STATE SUPERINTENDENTS SUCH A SYSTEM WOULD TAKE AWAY THE LOCAL INITIATIVE AND OPTION AND WOULD MAKE ALL SCHOOLS CONFORM TO A CERTAIN STANDARD OR FOR FAILURE DEPRIVE THEM OF PUBLIC MONEY SUCH A SYSTEM BECOMES REALLY DICTATORIAL POSSIBLY SUCH A PLAN MIGHT BE DESIRABLE BUT ITS REAL NATURE SHOULD BE SEEN BY THOSE WHO ARGUE FOR IT AND DENOUNCE THE PRESENT ACCREDITING AGENCIES WHICH MAKE FOR FREEDOM AS A PUBLICSCHOOL MAN IN WISCONSIN I BELIEVED THOROUGHLY IN THE UNI VERSITY ACCREDITED SYSTEM AND AS A COLLEGE OFFICIAL AND AS A STUDENT OF EDU CATIONAL ADMINISTRATION I REGARD IT AS CONTRIBUTING WONDERFULLY TO FREEDOM IN TEACHING AND LEARNING AND AS MOST BENEFICIAL AND UPLIFTING IN ITS EFFECTS UPON THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS F E B NOTES 505

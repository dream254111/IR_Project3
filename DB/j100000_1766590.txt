variety pic turesqueness and beauty of their domestic architecture Many typical houses from these cities will appear in the illustrations Mrs Sylvanus Reed for twentysix years the head of a famous private school for girls in New York says in the October number I took the college system for men and eliminated from it studies the educational value of which were questioned by high authorities and adapted it to the needs of women Just now when in these colleges woman has demonstrated that she can do in an examina tion just as much and as well as a young man the great universi ties of England and America have discovered what a quarter of a century go I believed to be the case that much of this prepara tion is a waste of time and energy Robert Brewster Stanton chief engineer of the party

of disease It consists in the collection of the specifics used by noted special ists of Europe and America and bringing them within the reach of all For instance the treat ment pursued by special physicians who treat indigestion stomach and liver troubles only was obtained and prepared The treatment of other physicians celebrated for curing catarrh was procured and so on till these incomparable cures now include disease of the lungs kidneys female weakness rheumatism and nervous de bility This new method of one remedy for one disease must appeal to the common sense of all sufferers many of whom have experienced the ill effects and thoroughly realize the ab surdity of the claims of Patent Medicines which are guaranteed to cure every ill out of a single bottle and the use of which as statistics prove has ruined more stomachs than alcohol A cir cular describing these new remedies is sent free on receipt of stamp to pay postage by Hospital Remedy Company Toronto

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010873,BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS,I242585,BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS BY C M KEYS FINANCIAL EDITOR WORLDS WORK NEW YORK CITY SINKING FUNDS IN PRIVATE FINANCE ARE PAYMENTS MADE BY A COR PORATION TO THE TRUSTEE OF ITS BONDS TO BE DEVOTED TO THE RETIRE MENT OF THE BONDS EITHER AT MATURITY SERIALLY OR IN INSTALMENTS USUALLY ANNUAL IN KIND THE SINKING FUNDS PRESENT AN ALMOST IN FINITE VARIETY IN EFFECT THEY ARE UNIFORM THEY TEND TO REDUCE THE OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES AGAINST THE PROPERTY OF THE CORPORATION AND HENCE TO ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THE EQUITY REPRESENTED BY THE STOCK OF THAT CORPORATION IN THE CASE OF PUBLIC FINANCE GOVERNMENT BONDS STATE BONDS AND MUNICIPALS THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SINKING FUND IS SLIGHTLY DIFFER ENT THE GOVERNMENT AND THE MUNICIPALITY ARE NOT USUALLY IN BUSI NESS THEY HAVE NO REVENUES EXCEPT TAXES IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER IF IT BE ACCEPTED AS AN AXIOM THAT THE PUBLIC DEBT MUST BE KEPT DOWN TO A FAIR PARITY WITH THE PROPERTY OWNED OR GOVERNED BY THE PUBLIC THEN SINKING FUNDS BECOME AN EXPEDIENT THAT COMES CLOSE TO BEING A NECESSITY FOR THE CORRECT PRINCIPLE OF PUBLIC TAXATION IS THAT THE PEOPLE WHO ENJOY AND BENEFIT FROM THE PUBLIC DEBT SHOULD BE THE PEOPLE TO PAY IT OFF FOR INSTANCE THE PEOPLE OF NEW ROCHELLE N Y DECIDE TO BUILD NEW FIRE STATIONS BONDS ARE ISSUED FOR THOSE STATIONS THE BONDS HAVE THIRTY YEARS TO RUN IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE OF I937 TO MEET THE WHOLE BURDEN OF PAYING OFF THIS DEBT WHICH WILL REPRESENT AT THAT TIME NOT THE NEW EFFICIENT AND NECESSARY PLANT OF TODAY BUT A PLANT THIRTY YEARS OLD AND PROBABLY OBSOLETE IF SUCH A BOND BE ALLOWED TO RUN TO MATURITY WITHOUT SOME SINKING FUND PROVISION THE PEOPLE OF 1937 WILL PROBABLY BE OBLIGED TO FINANCE NOT MERELY THE MATURING BONDS BUT AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SUFFICIENT TO REBUILD THE PLANT FROM TOP TO BOTTOM IT IS BY SUCH SHORTSIGHTED METHODS THAT GOVERN MENTS AND MORE ESPECIALLY LOCAL MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENTS RUN INTO DISASTROUS DEBT IT IS WELL TO TAKE UP THE QUESTION OF CORPORATION SINKING FUNDS SOMEWHAT IN EXTENSO BEFORE TURNING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF STATE 213THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SINKING FUNDS IN DETAIL IN GENERAL THE WRITER DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT SINKING FUNDS FOR CORPORATION BONDS ARE GOOD FINANCE THE FOLLOWING OBJECTIONS MAY BE NOTED I A CERTAIN SUM TO BE USED EACH YEAR FROM CURRENT REVENUES TO PURCHASE THE BONDS OF A CERTAIN ISSUE AT O10 AND INTEREST OR OTHER SUCH PRICE ILLUSTRATION THE NEBRASKA EXTENSION 4S CHICAGO BUR LINGTON AND QUINCY 1927 A SINKING FUND OF THIS SORT ESTABLISHES A FICTITIOUS PRICE IN THE CASE IN POINT IT MEANS THAT THE REVENUES OF THE STOCKHOLDERS ARE DIVERTED TO THE PURCHASE OF BONDS AT IIO WHICH WILL IF ALLOWED TO RUN BE PAID OFF AT IOO SINCE THE ISSUE IS A LARGE ONE THE WASTE SEEMS TO AGGREGATE NEARLY 2500000 THERE SEEMS NO GOOD REASON FOR THE SINKING FUND AT ALL 2 A CERTAIN SUM TO BE SET ASIDE TO BE USED IN THE PURCHASE OF A CERTAIN BOND AT CERTAIN TIMES AT A FIXED PRICE OR IN OTHER SECURI TIES IF THE BONDS NAMED CANNOT BE SECURED AT THE PRICE ILLUSTRATION BURLINGTON AND MISSOURI RIVER IN NEBRASKA SINKING FUND DEBEN TURE 4S SUCH A SINKING FUND IS OF LITTLE OR NO USE TO THE HOLDERS OF THE BONDS IN A RECEIVERSHIP BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEIR MAIN RELIANCE MUST BE IN THE PROPERTY PLEDGED UNDER THE MORTGAGE MOREOVER IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN THE OTHER SECURITIES PURCHASED ARE THE BONDS OF OTHER ISSUES OF THE SAME SYSTEM AND THEREFORE EXPOSED TO THE SAME RISKS AS THE BONDS RETIRED SUPPOSE FOR INSTANCE THAT THIS ISSUE WAS FOUND AT MATURITY BALANCED IN THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY AGAINST A COLLECTION OF OTHER BRANCH LINE BONDS OF THE BURLINGTON SYSTEM WHAT FUNDS WOULD BE USED TO PAY THE HOLDERS OF THESE BONDS CLEARLY UNLESS THE COMPANY HAPPENED TO HAVE A GREAT AMOUNT OF CASH ON HAND IT WOULD BE NECESSARY EITHER TO SELL THE DIVISIONAL BONDS IN THE TREASURY OR ELSE REFINANCE THE MATURING BONDS IN SOME OTHER BONDS OR STOCK IT IS RATHER DIFFICULT TO FIND OUT WHAT ADVANTAGE HAS LEEN GAINED THROUGH THE SINKING FUND SO FAR AS THE PAYMENT OF THE DEBT IS CONCERNED 3 A CERTAIN SUM TO BE SET ASIDE TO RETIRE OR CALL A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF THE BONDS EACH YEAR SAY AT PAR ILLUSTRATION REPUBLICAN VALLEY RAILROAD 6S FEW INVESTORS DESIRE TO PURCHASE A BOND THAT MAY BE FORCIBLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THEM AT ANY TIME BY LOT IN PARTICULAR THEY DO NOT WANT TO BUY SUCH A BOND AT ANY PRICE ABOVE THE FIGURE AT WHICH 214 22BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS IT MAY BE CALLED OF COURSE SHREWD DEALERS FIGURE THE CHANCES ON SUCH REDEMPTION AND OFTEN ESTABLISH A PRICE ABOVE THE CALL PRICE BUT THE AVERAGE INVESTOR DOES NOT CARE FOR THAT KIND OF CHANCES IN HIS USE OF MONEY IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES MUNICIPAL BONDS ARE CREATED WITH SUCH AN ELEMENT OF CHANCE IN THE DRAWING FOR REDEMPTION THAT THEY COME VERY CLOSE TO THE LOTTERY TICKET IN THEIR NATURE IF A MAN HAPPEN TO GET AN EARLY REDEMPTION HIS PROFITS MAY BE OVER 20 PER CENT IN THE YEAR THAT IS NOT A CORRECT PRIN CIPLE TO INTRODUCE INTO THE BOND MARKET 4 A CERTAIN SUM TO BE SET ASIDE TO PURCHASE THE BONDS AT A CERTAIN PRICE OR TO BE USED AT THE DISCRETION OF THE TRUSTEES IF THE BONDS CANNOT BE OBTAINED AT THAT PRICE ILLUSTRATION LINCOLN AND NORTHWESTERN RAILROAD 7S THIS PROVISION SPEAKS FOR ITSELF THE FACT THAT IT IS FOUND MOSTLY IN VERY SMALL MORTGAGES ON BIG SYSTEMS REVEALS THE DOUBT THAT NATURALLY HOVERS AROUND IT SUPPOSE THAT IT WERE APPLIED TO A MORTGAGE FOR IOOOOOOOO WITH AN ANNUAL SINKING FUND OF 2OOO OOO IT WOULD THEN PROVIDE THE TRUSTEE IN YEARS WHEN THE BONDS WERE TOO HIGH WITH A COMFORTABLE LITTLE FUND WITH WHICH HE COULD DO PRETTY MUCH AS HE LIKED WITHIN REASON CERTAINLY THE PRINCIPLE OF SUCH A PROVISION IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF NO DEFENSE IN GENERAL THERE CAN BE LITTLE DEFENSE OF THE SINKING FUND AS A FINANCIAL EXPEDIENT IN RAILROAD OR CORPORATION FINANCE IT IS DIFFI CULT TO SEE BY WHAT RIGHT THE STOCKHOLDERS OF THE CHICAGO BURLING TON AND QUINCY ARE ASKED TO GIVE UP EACH YEAR OVER 700000 OF THEIR REVENUE TO FORM A FUND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE BONDHOLDERS IF IT WERE A FACT THAT THE PROPERTY UPON WHICH THE BONDS ARE LIENS WAS WASTING THROUGH DECAY OR DETERIORATING THROUGH USE THEN THERE WOULD BE SOME REASON IN IT BUT SINCE THE MORTGAGE IN MOST CASES PROVIDES THAT NO SUCH WASTE OR DECAY MAY TAKE PLACE AND SINCE THE STOCKHOLDERS YEARLY CONTRIBUTE IN MAINTENANCE CHARGES MORE THAN ENOUGH TO KEEP THE PROPERTY IN THE CONDITION CALLED FOR UNDER THE MORTGAGE IT SEEMS TRANSPARENT THAT THE SINKING FUND CHARGE IS A BURDEN QUITE UNNECESSARY AND PERHAPS EVEN UNJUST OF COURSE IT MAY BE ARGUED THAT THE STOCKHOLDERS GET THE ULTI MATE BENEFIT OF THE RETIREMENT OF THE BONDS WHEN A STUDENT OF FINANCE UNDERTAKES TO ANALYZE THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE CHICAGO BURLINGTON AND QUINCY HE ALWAYS RECKONS THE SINKING FUNDS AS BELONGING TO THE STOCKHOLDERS BUT THE AVERAGE STOCKHOLDER WOULD 215 23THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MUCH PREFER TO HAVE HIS PROFITS IN MONEY IN THE CASE IN POINT THE DLD STOCKHOLDERS OF THE BURLINGTON WHOSE SACRIFICES BUILT UP THE SINKING FUNDS SO LARGELY SOLD OUT OF THEIR STOCK IN THE YEARS THAT FOLLOWED THE GREAT DECLINE OF THE EARLY DAYS OF THE LAST DECADE AND THE PROFIT OF THE SELFSACRIFICE MADE BY THOSE STOCKHOLDERS HAS GONE TO MR J J HILL AND HIS FRIENDS OR TO THE GREAT NORTHERN AND THE NORTHERN PACIFIC IT MAY BE IN A GENERAL WAY IT IS NOT USUALLY A GOOD THING FOR THE STOCKHOLDER TO BE QUIXOTIC OR TO BUILD WITH AN EYE SINGLE TO THE INTERESTS OF TOMORROW FOR THE HISTORY OF OUR GREAT CORPORATIONS HAS SHOWN INDUBITABLY THAT WHERE ONE SOWS OFTEN IN TEARS ANOTHER REAPS IN JOY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE SINKING FUND IN OPERATION IN THE BONDS OF A CORPORATION OF THIS NATURE IS HARDLY DEFENSIBLE YET MANY HAVE DEFENDED IT IN THIS PAST YEAR SO ABLE A FINANCIAL WRITER AS MR EDGAR VAN DEUSEN FORMER INSTRUCTOR IN FINANCE AT TUCK SCHOOL DARTMOUTH COLLEGE WRITING IN THE BANKERS MAGAZINE STATED HIS THESIS IN THE FOLLOWING WORDS IT IS A SIGNIFICANT FACT THAT ALL THE STRONG COMPANIES OF THE NORTHWEST HAVE DEVELOPED IN CONNECTION WITH THEIR SINKING FUND POLICY UNTIL TODAY THEY OCCUPY AN ALMOST IMPREGNABLE POSITION THE SINKING FUND BESIDES CONSTITUTING A SAFETY FUND FOR THOSE PAR TICULAR BONDHOLDERS FURNISHES A PROPER OUTLET FOR THE UNCOMMONLY LARGE EARNINGS OF STRONG CORPORATIONS IT MAY BE CLAIMED THAT EXCEPTIONAL EARNINGS SHOULD BE PAID TO SHAREHOLDERS RATHER THAN HELD AS A TRUST FUND FOR THE BENEFIT OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF CREDITORS BUT WHERE THIS LATTER COURSE IS FOLLOWED AND THE INDEBTEDNESS PROPOR TIONATELY REDUCED UNTIL THE PROPERTY IS SO FAR FREE FROM ENCUM BRANCE THE SINKING FUND PAYMENTS ULTIMATELY ACCRUE TO THE BENEFIT OF THE STOCKHOLDER THROUGH THE RESULTANT INCREASE IN THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY WHILE IN THE MEANTIME OF PROTECTION TO THE BONDHOLDER FURTHERMORE UNUSUALLY HIGH DIVIDENDS ARE NEVER PAID REGULARLY TO STOCKHOLDERS BUT THE SURPLUS REMAINS AS AN UNAP PROPRIATED FUND WHICH MAY BE EASILY JUGGLED BY AN UNSCRUPULOUS MANAGEMENT FOR THEIR OWN ADVANTAGE AND THE COMPANYS POSSI BLE DETRIMENT WHEN IT HAS NO PREDETERMINED USE AS A SINKING FUND SUCH A PROVISION ACCORDINGLY SEEMS DESIRABLE TO BOTH BOND AND STOCKHOLDER EVEN IN THE CASE OF STRONG CORPORATIONS SINCE THIS VIEW IS WIDELY HELD AND HAS MANY STRONG ADVO CATES IT IS AS WELL TO TAKE IT UP IN SOME DETAIL LET US LOOK 216 24BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS FOR INSTANCE AT THE STRONG COMPANIES OF THE NORTHWEST ABOVE REFERRED TO DID THE PROFITS THROUGH SINKING FUNDS ULTIMATELY ACCRUE TO THE STOCKHOLDERS WHO PROVIDED THEM THE UNION PACIFIC THE OREGON SHORT LINE THE OREGON RAILROAD AND NAVI GATION COMPANY AND THE NORTHERN PACIFIC PASSED THROUGH REORGAN IZATIONS OF VARIOUS SORTS AND IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE HOW THE ORIGINAL SELFSACRIFICE OF THE OLD NORTHERN PACIFIC RAILWAY STOCKHOLDERS HAS BEEN REPAID IN PROFITS WITHOUT GOING INTO DETAIL WITH REGARD TO THE VARIOUS CHANGES THAT HAVE COME TO THE ROADS ABOVE MENTIONED IT MAY BE STATED THAT THEY ARE EVIDENTLY NOT MEANT IN MR VAN DEUSENS STATEMENT HE REFERS THEN TO THE BURLINGTON THE NORTHWESTERN AND THE GREAT NORTHERN THE LAST NAMED HAS ABOUT I2OOOOOO IN ITS SINK ING FUNDS IN THE OLD BONDS OF THE ST P M  M R R THE WRITER HAS NEVER HEARD IT ADVANCED AS A GREAT REASON FOR THE VALUE OF THE STOCK OF THE GREAT NORTHERN RAILWAY THAT THIS SINK ING FUND EXISTED AND HE CANNOT BELIEVE THAT IT IS MORE THAN AN INFINITESIMAL FACTOR IN THE VALUE OF THAT STOCK THE CASE OF THE BURLINGTON IS TOUCHED UPON IN PREVIOUS PARAGRAPHS THE CHICAGO AND NORTHWESTERN IS A BETTER CLIENT FOR THE ADVOCATE OF THE SINKING FUND BUT EVEN HERE IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO PROVE THAT MORE THAN A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE STOCKHOLDERS WHO BUILT UP THE SINKING FUNDS TO OVER IOOOOOOO IN I9OI REAPED MUCH ADVANTAGE FROM THE PRICES THAT HAVE RULED IN THIS STOCK THIS PAST YEAR OR TWO FOR THE ROAD WAS NEARLY CAPTURED BY THE MOORE BROTHERS AND THEIR ASSOCIATES IN I902 AND THE OWNERSHIP SHIFTED RADICALLY AS TO THE JUGGLING WITH THE SURPLUS SUCH AN EPISODE IS SURELY RARE THE GREAT MAGNATES SELDOM CONFINE THEIR JUGGLING TO THE SMALL AMOUNTS THAT ACCRUE TO THE INCOME SURPLUS FROM YEAR TO YEAR THE JUGGLING OF THE ROCK ISLAND THE CINCINNATI HAM ILTON AND DAYTON THE PERE MARQUETTE THE CHICAGO AND ALTON THE UNION PACIFIC WAS NOT DONE THROUGH AN INCOME ACCOUNT IT WAS DONE THROUGH CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE MEN HAVE AT TIMES RIFLED THE SINKING FUNDS PLUNDERED THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT SPLIT THE STOCKS ROBBED THE IMPROVEMENT ACCOUNTS AND DONE VARI OUS OTHER HIGHHANDED ACTS OF FINANCIAL PIRACY FOR PERSONAL GAINS ON A LARGE SCALE BUT I CANNOT RECALL A CASE FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE WHERE ANY GREAT FINANCIAL WRONG WAS WORKED UPON THE STOCKHOLDERS THROUGH THE APPROPRIATION OF THE INCOME SURPLUS PETTY WRONGS 217 25THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ARE EASY TO REMEMBER BUT JUGGLING ON A LARGE SCALE HAS ALWAYS BEEN DONE THROUGH OTHER AGENCIES TURNING FROM THE STRONG COMPANIES IT IS TIME TO MAKE INQUIRY AS TO THE EFFECT OF A SINKING FUND ON THE WEAK COMPANIES THE HISTORY OF FINANCE TELLS THE STORY CLEARLY ENOUGH IN CASES WHERE IT HAS BECOME NECESSARY TO SAVE THE CORPORATION THE SINKING FUNDS ARE PASSED WITHOUT MUCH HESITATION IT WILL BE FOUND THAT IT IS DIFFICULT IN MANYCASES IMPOSSIBLE TO ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF THE SINKING FUND AS STRICTLY AS ONE MAY ENFORCE THE PAYMENT OF INTEREST OR PRINCIPAL AS A MATTER OF SOBER FACT THE TRUSTEE OF THE MORTGAGE IS GENERALLY FOUND TO BE PRETTY COMPLACENT AND HE WILL NOT GO INTO COURT TO THROW THE ROAD INTO THE HANDS OF A RECEIVER TO COLLECT THE SINKING FUND IF HE SHOULD DO SO AND THERE SHOULD BE A SUDDEN COLLAPSE IN THE PRICES OF THE BONDS THE BONDHOLDERS WOULD BE THE FIRST TO EXECRATE HIM A SINKING FUND IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BREAK A COMPANY A WEAK CORPORATION STRIVING TO BUILD UP ITS PROPERTY CAN GAIN NO BENEFIT THROUGH BEING OBLIGED TO TAKE IN SOME OF ITS OLDER AND BETTER ESTABLISHED BONDS EACH YEAR IF THE MONEY USED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE IS APPROPRIATED DIRECTLY FOR IMPROVEMENTS AND ADDITIONS THE BENEFIT IS FAR MORE DIRECT AND THE COMPANY GAINS FAR MORE STRENGTH THAN IT COULD GAIN THROUGH THE SINKING FUND THAT THIS IS RECOGNIZED MAY BE HAPPILY ILLUSTRATED FROM THE RECORD OF THE ROCK ISLAND COMPANY WHEN THE CHICAGO ROCK ISLAND AND PACIFIC RAILWAY COMPANY BOUGHT THE CHOCTAW OKLA HOMA AND GULF IT ISSUED FOR THAT STOCK ITS COLLATERAL TRUST BONDS PAYABLE IN SERIES UP TO I918 NO PROVISION WAS MADE AT THE TIME FOR PAYING THE ANNUAL INSTALMENTS AMOUNTING TO ABOUT I475000 EXCEPT FROM THE EARNINGS OF THE CHICAGO ROCK ISLAND AND PACIFIC IT WAS SOON SEEN HOWEVER THAT THE PAYMENT OUT OF INCOME WAS A BURDEN AND SURELY AN UNJUST ONE FOR WHY SHOULD THE STOCKHOLD ERS SACRIFICE A LARGE PART OF THEIR SURPLUS TO BUY STOCKS FOR THE CAPI TAL ACCOUNT THEREFORE WHEN THE REFUNDING MORTGAGE WAS MADE IN 1904 PROVISION WAS MADE UNDER IT FOR THE PAYMENT OF THESE SERIAL INSTALMENTS TODAY THE ROCK ISLAND APPROPRIATES ITS INCOME SUR PLUS DIRECTLY FOR THE PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT AND FOR IMPROVEMENTS WHO WILL SAY THAT THE CHANGE IS NOT TO THE BENEFIT BOTH OF THE PROP ERTY AND ITS STOCKHOLDERS  IT IS AS WELL HAVING GONE THUS FAR IN THE DISCUSSION TO DEFINE THIS CRITICISM OF THE SINKING FUND PRINCIPLE LEST IT BE THOUGHT THAT 218 26BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS THE CRITICISM APPLIES WITH EQUAL FORCE TO ALL CORPORATION SINKING FUNDS THE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THE STUDY OF THE QUESTION POINTS MAY BE STATED AS FOLLOWS THAT SINKING FUNDS ARE NOT ADVISABLE BUT RATHER ARE UNJUST WHEN APPLIED TO BONLDS THAT ARE ISSUED TO PURCHASE OR CREATE PERNMA NENT ADDITIONS TO THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT OR PROPERTIES THAT WILL PERMA NENTLY ESTABLISH NEW EARNING CAPACITY FOR THE PROPERTY OF THE COR PORATION IT IS ON THIS WORD PERMANENT THAT THE WHOLE DISCUSSION HINGES WHEN BONDS ARE ISSUED TO PURCHASE SOME PROPERTY THAT WILL WASTE WITH TIME OR WILL ENTIRELY DISAPPEAR IN A FEW YEARS TAKING ITS EARNING CAPACITY WITH IT THE SINKING FUND IS NOT ONLY ADVISABLE BUT IT IS NECESSARY IF THE CORPORATION WILL AVOID THE EVIL OF STOCK AND BOND WATERING IF A COMPANY ISSUES 40000OOO OF BONDS TO PURCHASE A COAL MINE CONTAINING 2000000 TONS OF COAL AND TAKES ALL THE COAL OUT WITHIN FIVE YEARS THE BONDS REMAIN AS A PERMANENT CHARGE AGAINST THE EARNINGS OF THE CORPORATION AND FUTURE STOCKHOLDERS ARE ASSESSED TO PAY INTEREST ON CAPITAL FROM WHICH THEY DERIVE NOT ONE DOLLAR OF BENEFIT IN EVERY SUCH CASE THERE SHOULD BE A SINKING FUND A GOOD SINKING FUND OF THIS SORT ESTABLISHED ON A SENSIBLE AND SANE BUT RATHER PECULIAR PRINCIPLE IS THE FUND OF THE READING COMPANY AND PHILADELPHIA AND READING COAL AND IRON JOINT GEN ERAL GOLD 4S OF 1997 THE SINKING FUND PROVISION IS AS FOLLOWS THAT THE READING COMPANY SHALL NOT IN ANY YEAR PAY A DIVI DEND ON EITHER CLASS OF STOCK UNTIL IT SHALL HAVE PAID TO THE TRUSTEE FIVE CENTS PER TON OF ANTHRACITE COAL MINED IN THE PRECEDING YEAR FROM THE COAL AND IRON COMPANYS LANDSTO AN AMOUNT NOT EXCEED ING THE AMOUNT OF DIVIDENDS IN SUCH PRECEDING YEAR THIS SUM IS APPLIED TO THE PURCHASE OF THESE BONDS AT NOT EXCEEDING PAR IF BONDS ARE NOT OBTAINABLE AT THAT PRICE THE FUND IS TO BE INVESTED IN SUCH SECURITIES AS ARE LEGAL FOR NEW YORK SAVINGS BANKS FOR THE SALE OF CLEARNESS THE PROVISION IS HERE TAKEN FROM MOODYS MANUAL FOR I907 RATHER THAN FROM THE MORTGAGE SIMILAR FUNDS WILL BE FOUND IN OPERATION IN NEARLY ALL CON SERVATIVE COAL MINING COMPANIES THOUGH THE PROVISIONS AS TO CALL PRICE INVESTMENTS ETC WILL VARY IN EACH CASE THE PRINCIPLE OF COURSE IS THAT THE BONDS SHALL BE RETIRED CONTEMPORANEOUSLY WITH THE EXHAUSTION OF THE COAL SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS ARE USUALLY 219 27THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MADE IN THE BONDING OF A LUMBER TRACT A LAND COMPANY OR ANY BODY OF PROPERTY PURCHASED TO BE RESOLD THE CANADIAN PACIFIC HAS RECENTLY RETIRED THE LAST OF ITS LAND GRANT BONDS AGAINST BAL ANCES UNPAID BY THE PURCHASERS IN SUCH MORTGAGES WHERE AGRI CULTURAL LAND UNDERLIES THE MORTGAGE A SINKING FUND IS USUALLY BASED UPON A PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT RECEIVED IN ANY ONE YEAR FOR LANDS SOLD BUT THIS OF COURSE IS ARBITRARY AND VARIES GREATLY IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE RAILROADS OF THE UNITED STATES GENERALLY OBSERVE AS AXIOMATIC THAT SUCH WASTING PROPERTIES AS LAND TIMBER AND COAL DEMAND A SINKING FUND ON THE BONDS IN RESPECT TO COAL THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS GENERALLY OBSERVED THROUGHOUT THE LONG LIST OF SMALL INDEPENDENT COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY THE INDUSTRIAL COMPANIES ARE NOT AS A RULE SO SOUNDLY FINANCED IN THIS RESPECT AS ARE THE RAILROADS THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION AND MANY OTHERS OF THE BIG COMPANIES HAVE ESTABLISHED SINKING FUNDS WITH THEIR BONDS ON WASTING PROP ERTIES BUT ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THE LITTLE SCATTERED COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SO CONSERVATIVE FREQUENT CASES COULD BE CITED WHERE A LUMBER DEVELOPMENT COMPANY A PAPER COMPANY A LAND COMPANY OR A MINING COMPANY HAS DEPLETED ITS FIXED ASSETS YEAR BY YEAR PAID DIVIDENDS TO ITS STOCKHOLDERS THEN FINALLY LEFT THE BONDHOLDERS TO FORECLOSE ON STRIPPED TIMBER LANDS OR EMPTY HOLES IN THE GROUND IT IS TOO ORDINARY A STORY TO NEED ELABORATION FROM THIS FACT ARISES THE RULE SO STRONGLY ENFORCED IN CON SERVATIVE BANKING CIRCLES THAT ALL INDUSTRIAL BONDS MUST BE CARE FULLY SCRUTINIZED BEFORE PURCHASED IT IS NOT ADVISABLE TO MAKE ANY PERMANENT INVESTMENT IN INDUSTRIAL BONDS SECURED ON WASTING PROP ERTIES UNLESS THE SINKING FUNDS ARE LIBERAL IN A VERY GENERAL WAY THE NATURE OF THE SINKING FUNDS FOR VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS MAY BE ITEMIZED COAL COMPANYA ROYALTY OF TWO CENTS TO TEN CENTS PER TON MINED PER ANNUM TO BE INVESTED IN THE BONDS AT A FIXED PRICE DRAWING BY LOT IS ADVISABLE LAND COMPANYFIXED SUM PER ACRE OR LOT SOLD THE AGGRE GATE AMOUNT BEING SUFFICIENT TO RETIRE THE WHOLE ISSUE CONTEMPO RANEOUSLY WITH THE SALE OF THE LAST ACRE OR LOT MANUFACTURING COMPANYAN ANNUAL RENEWAL FUND QUITE APART FROM THE IMPROVEMENT FUND SUFFICIENT TO REPLACE THE PLANT WHEN IT IS WORN OUT THE PERIOD VARIES IF THE MACHINERY WILL 220 28BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FIUNDS LAST TEN

PRACTICALLY CERTAIN TO OVERCAPITALIZE SOONER OR LATER LUMBER OR PAPER COMPANYA CHARGE OF SO MUCH PER THOUSAND FEET ON LUMBER CUT OR SO MUCH A CORD ON PULPWOOD CUT SUFFICIENT TO RETIRE THE BONDS AT EXHAUSTION OF THE PROPERTY THIS FUND SHOULD BE COMPULSORY AND CLEARLY STATED AS SUCH IN THE MORTGAGE WITH PROPER PENALTIES ATTACHED STEAMSHIP COMPANYANNUAL DEPRECIATION FUND SUFFICIENT TO REPLACE THE TONNAGE IN THE FLEET WHEN WORN OUT THIS IS OF COURSE INTENDED TO BE MERELY AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE SINKING FUNDS SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED IT IS NOT AT ALL INTENDED TO BE EXHAUSTIVE IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO SAY THAT EVERY MANUFACTURING COMPANY THAT ISSUES BONDS AGAINST ITS BUILDINGS ITS PLANTS ITS SUPPLIES OF RAW MATERIAL MUST HAVE SINKING FUNDS IF IT DOES NOT ITS BUSINESS WILL HAVE TO CARRY AN EVERINCREASING BURDEN OF CAPITAL SUPPOSE A SUGAR COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING 50OOO OF FIVE PER CENT BONDS AGAINST ITS PLANT MATUR ING IN THIRTY YEARS THE ENTIRE PLANT WILL BE WORN OUT IN FIFTEEN YEARS LET US SAY NEW BUILDINGS MUST BE ERECTED AND NEW MA CHINERY PUT IN HOW IS IT GOING TO BE DONE IF THERE HAS BEEN NO SINKING FUND THAT ISSUE OF 50000 MUST STAND AS A FIRST LIEN AGAINST THE RENEWED PLANT PRESUMABLY IT WILL TAKE AT LEAST AS MUCH AGAIN TO RENEW THE DEBT AGAINST THE PLANT AT THE MATURITY OF THE FIRST MORTGAGE WILL BE IOOOO0 IF THERE HAVE BEEN NO SINKING FUNDS AT ALL THE PLANT WILL BE AGAIN WORN OUT AND THE ASSETS OF THE BONDS MATURING WILL BE PRACTICALLY NIL TURNING AGAIN TO THE RAILROAD FIELD ATTENTION TODAY CENTERS UPON THE QUESTION OF PAYING FOR THE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF NEW ENGINES AND CARS THAT ARE CONSTANTLY MADE NECESSARY BY THE INCREASING FLOOD OF TRAFFIC HERE IS A FIELD IN WHICH THE SINKING FUND PRINCIPLE IS GENERALLY INSISTED ON BY THE BEST AND MOST CONSERVATIVE CRITICS IN GENERAL THE CRITICS TAKE THE GROUND THAT ALL EQUIPMENT ADDED TO THE ROLLS OF AN ESTABLISHED RAILROAD SYSTEM SHOULD BE PAID FOR OUT OF CURRENT EARNINGS WITHIN THE LIFETIME OF THE EQUIPMENT IN CASES WHERE THE ACCUMULATED EARNINGS ARE NOT SUFFICIENT TO PAY FOR THE REQUIRED ENGINES AND CARS IN A LUMP SUM THE SALE OF SERIAL EQUIPMENT BONDS OR NOTESUSUALLY CALLED EQUIPMENT TRUSTSIS AP 221 29THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROVED THE MOST EXTREME OF THE CRITICS WOULD NOT ALLOW THE PER MANENT BONDING OF ANY NEW EQUIPMENT EXCEPT WHAT IS INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL COST OF THE COMPLETED PROPERTY AS RAILROAD EDITOR OF THE WALL STREET JOURNAL THE WRITER ON A PREVIOUS OCCASION TOOK THIS ATTITUDE IN CRITICISING THE NEW REFUND ING MORTGAGES OF THE CHICAGO ROCK ISLAND AND PACIFIC AND THE COLORADO AND SOUTHERN WHEN THEY WERE CREATED IT SEEMED RIGHT TO DEPLORE THE TENDENCY OF THE FINANCIERS AT THE PRESENT TIME TO PLACE PRACTICALLY ALL THEIR NEW EQUIPMENT UNDER PERMANENT MORTGAGES THAT THIS TENDENCY EXISTS IS WELL KNOWN YET REFLECTION AND STUDY OF THE EQUIPMENT SITUATION THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY HAVE TENDED TO AT LEAST SOFTEN IF NOT TO CHANGE THE OPINION EXPRESSED AT THAT TIME APPLYING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLE THAT ALL PERMANENT ADDITIONS TO THE PLANT SHOULD BE FINANCED UNDER PERMANENT MORTGAGES AND ALL TEMPORARY ADDITIONS BY BONDS OR NOTES UNDER SINKING FUNDS THE DIVISION OF THE EQUIPMENT CHARGES OF THE ROAD MAY BE MADE WITH JUSTICE RENEWALS OF THE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT COVERED BY THE CON STRUCTION MORTGAGES OR OF ANY EQUIPMENT BOUGHT SUBSEQUENTLY UNDER BOND ISSUES AND PLEDGED WITH THE TRUSTEE OF THOSE MORT GAGES OR EVEN NOT PLEDGED SHOULD COME OUT OF THE CURRENT REVENUES THIS IS USUALLY ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF A REPLACEMENT FUND NOT PEREMPTORY BUT OPTIONAL WITH THE DIRECTORS THE FUND IS BUILT UP IN GOOD YEARS AND CARRIED AS A LIABILITY IN THE BALANCE SHEET THE OBJECT OF SUCH A FUND SHOULD BE NOT TO INCREASE THE EARN ING CAPACITY OF THE PROPERTY SO MUCH AS TO MAINTAIN IT AT ALL TIMES DURING THE LIFE OF A RAILROAD THE EARNING CAPACITY REPRESENTED BY THE EQUIPMENT PUT ON THE ROAD AT BUILDING AND SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED THROUGH PERMANENT FINANCING SHOULD BE KEPT INTACT WITHOUT RESOURCE TO THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN ANY WAY IT SHOULD NOT THEORET ICALLY BE INCREASED OUT OF CURRENT REVENUES OF COURSE THERE COMES IN THE HISTORY OF MOST RAILROADS A LONG PERIOD DURING WHICH THE PLANT IS ALLOWED TO RUN DOWN THE PROPERTY AND MORE ESPECIALLY THE EQUIPMENT IS SCIENTIFICALLY SKINNED BY THE MANAGEMENT FOR PER SONAL PROFIT TO PAY DIVIDENDS OR TO MAKE A SHOWING THE WASTE THROUGH SUCH PROCESS SHOULD BE MADE GOOD OUT OF EARNINGS WITH OUT RECOURSE TO CAPITAL ACCOUNT SUCH A PROCESS HAS BEEN IN ACTION ON THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC THE SANTA FE THE UNION PACIFIC AND MANY OTHER RAILROADS THROUGHOUT THE PAST FEW YEARS WHEN HOWEVER IT IS NECESSARY TO ADD NEW EQUIPMENT INCREAS 222 30BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FTUNDS ING THE NUMBER OF LOCOMOTIVES THE NUMBER OF CARS OR THE CAPACITY OF EITHER THE MOTIVE POWER OR THE ROLLING STOCK IT IS RIGHT TO CALL UPON THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT TO MAKE THE ADDITIONS FOR INSTANCE THE UNION PACIFIC IN I906 ADDED SEVENTYFOUR LOCOMOTIVES ONE WAS CHARGED TO REPLACEMENT AND SEVENTYTHREE TO FREE ASSETS I E TO CAPITAL THAT SEEMS JUST THE POINT OF THE DISTINCTION IS THAT THE ADDITION OF NEW EQUIPMENT INCREASING THE EARNING POWER OF THE PROPERTY AS A WHOLE SIMPLY INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE ROAD AS A WHOLE AND CREATES NEW PROPERTY WHICH MUST BE MAINTAINED AND RENEWED OUT OF EARNINGS BUT SHOULD NOT BE CREATED IN THAT WAY IN THE CASE OF THE ST LOUIS AND SAN FRANCISCO RAILROAD FOR INSTANCE WE HAVE A PROPERTY THAT WAS BUILT THROUGH A TERRITORY AND TO REACH TRAFFIC THAT DID NOT DEMAND A HEAVILYEQUIPPED RAIL ROAD PLANT AT THE OUTSET LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE NEW LINES OF THIS COMPANY THROUGH TEXAS AND THE TERRITORIES WERE BUILT AT THE OUTSET FOR 15000 PER MILE AND EQUIPPED FOR AN ADDITIONAL 6000 PER MILE AND THAT SECURITIES TO THE AGGREGATE MARKET VALUE OF 2I000 PER MILE WERE ISSUED AGAINST THIS LINE NOT EVEN THE MOST RADICAL EXPONENT OF THE SINKING FUND IDEA WOULD CLAIM THAT IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE PROVISION FOR A SINKING FUND AGAINST THESE SECURITIES THE FACT THAT THE EQUIPMENT PUT ON THE LINE WILL ALL BE WORN OUT IN TWENTY YEARS HAS NO WEIGHT THE POINT SEEMS TO BE THAT THE EARNING CAPACITY WHICH IS CREATED BY THE USE OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS A PERMANENT EARNING CAPACITY AND MAY PROPERLY BE MADE SUBJECT TO LONG TERM BONDS AND TAKE ITS PLACE UNDER THE ITEM PROPERTY AND FRANCHISES IN THE BALANCE SHEET OF THE COMPANY THE EQUIPMENT THUS CREATED SHOULD ALWAYS BE MAINTAINED AND RENEWED AT THE EXPENSE OF THE STOCKHOLDERS IN OTHER WORDS AT THE END OF TWENTY YEARS THERE SHOULD BE ON THIS LINE IN WORKING ORDER EQUIPMENT WORTH THIS 6OOO PER MILE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN CREATED BY AN ADDITIONAL CALL ON THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT IF HOWEVER IT HAS BEEN NECESSARY IN THE MEANTIME TO ADD VERY LARGELY TO THE CAPACITY OF THE EQUIPMENT ON THE LINE SUCH ADDITION MAY VERY PROP ERLY BE CHARGED TO CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND FINANCED UNDER A PERMANENT MORTGAGE WITHOUT A SINKING FUND THIS DISTINCTION WILL DRAW THE LINE PRETTY CLEARLY BETWEEN THE TWO KINDS OF ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY WHICH SHOULD BE FINANCED UNDER SINKING FUND AND PERMANENT SECURITIES RESPECTIVELY THE FIRST CLASS 223 3ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHICH ARE REALLY REPLACEMENTS OR RENEWALS AND WHICH MERELY PER PETUATE THE VALUE CREATED IN THE FIRST PLACE BY THE CONSTRUCTION FINANCING OR BY

ISSUES OF THIS NATURE ARE A LIEN ON THE ENTIRE AMOUNT OF THE EQUIPMENT PURCHASED UNTIL THE LAST OF THE SECURITIES ARE RETIRED TURNING FROM THE FIELD OF PRIVATE FINANCE TO THE QUESTION OF SINKING FUNDS ON GOVERNMENT AND MUNICIPAL DEBTS THE VARIETY BE COMES ALMOST INFINITE IT IS RECOGNIZED AS A RULE THAT THE DEBTS OF STATES OR MUNICIPALITIES BASED AS THEY ARE UPON ASSESSMENTS AND THE TAXES LEVIED ON THE BASIS OF SUCH ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE AMORTIZED THROUGH SINKING FUNDS THE USUAL METHOD OF ESTABLISHING SUCH A FUND FOR THE ISSUES OF MUNICIPALITIES IS TO PROVIDE IN THE RESOLUTION CREATING THE DEBT FOR THE PAYMENT OUT OF TAXES OF A CERTAIN AMOUNT YEAR BY YEAR TO BE INVESTED IN THE BONDS EITHER BY PURCHASE OR BY DRAWING THE BONDS SO CALLED ARE GENERALLY KEPT ALIVE IN THE SINK ING FUND AND THE INTEREST IS ADDED TO THE FUND FOR REDEMPTION OF THE BONDS THERE ARE HOWEVER HUNDREDS OF VARIATIONS OF THIS METHOD TO COVER THE VARIATIONS AND THE PHENOMENA OF SUCH SINKING FUNDS IN DETAIL WOULD BE AN

TO THE STATE BY CONGRESS NEW JERSEYTHE SMALL STATE DEBT OF NEW JERSEY IS AMPLY PROVIDED FOR THE SINKING FUNDS BEING GREATER THAN THE ENTIRE DEBT 226 34BOND REDEMPTION AND SINKING FUNDS IN EVERY YEAR SINCE I897 A UNIQUE PROVISION IN THIS STATE IS THAT THE TREASURY MAY BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE UP A DEFICIENCY IN THE SINKING FUND THE SAME TO BE PAID BACK AS THE FUNDS COME IN NEW YORKALL THE BONDS ISSUED BY NEW YORK STATE BETWEEN I890 AND 1902 WERE SERIAL BONDS AND THEREFORE NEEDED NO SINKING FUNDS EXCEPT THE CANAL BONDS THE SINKING FUNDS THEREFORE CONSIST OF A PART OF THE CANAL FUND OF THE STATE OHIOTHE CONSTITUTION REQUIRES AN ANNUAL SINKING FUND OF IOOOOO TO BE GATHERED FROM THE SALE OF LANDS PUBLIC WORKS OR STOCKS OWNED BY THE STATE FROM THE INCOME EARNED BY THE PROFIT PRODUCING PUBLIC WORKS AND THE STOCKS OWNED AND FROM A TAX TO BE LEVIED TO MAKE UP ANY DEFICIENCY LEFT BY THE ABOVE SOURCES OF REVENUE NORTH CAROLINATHIS STATE HAS TWO CLASSES OF SINKING FUNDS THE ORDINARY AND THE CUMULATIVE PHOSPHATE SINKING FUNDS THE INCOME OF THE LATTER IS DERIVED FROM ROYALTIES ON PHOSPHATES AMOUNTING TO 37500 PER ANNUM BOTH FUNDS ARE NOW INVESTED IN THE BONDS OF THE STATE WITHOUT CANCELATION A THIRD FUND FOR INSURANCE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE REGULAR GOVERNMENT REPORT OF THE SINKING FUND BUT IS TREATED SEPARATELY VIRGINIATHE SINKING FUND PROVISION IN VIRGINIA IS VERY ELAB ORATE THE FUND IS BASED LARGELY UPON THE STOCKS AND BONDS OF RAILROAD AND CANAL COMPANIES HELD BY THE STATE BOTH THE INCOME AND THE PRINCIPAL OF SUCH INVESTMENTS BEING INCLUDED THE FUND IS BASED ON THE SECURITIES OWNED PRIOR TO 1875 BUT THE LAW OF I894 SUPPLEMENTED THIS FUND BY THE ADDITION OF ALL REVENUES RECEIVED BY THE STATE FROM ITS INTEREST IN THE WORK OF INTERNAL IMPROVEMENT IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THERE IS NO GREAT UNIFORMITY IN THE MAIN TENANCE AND OPERATION OF THESE STATE FUNDS NOR DOES THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDS AT A CERTAIN DATE HAVE MUCH MEANING BECAUSE SUCH AMOUNT IS MADE UP ONLY FROM THE CASH OR BONDS OR STOCKS HELD ALIVE IN THE FUND IN CASES WHERE THE SINKING FUNDS ARE IMMEDIATELY INVESTED AND THE BONDS CANCELED THE AMORTIZATION OF THE DEBT GOES ON BUT THE GOVERNMENT REPORT DOES NOT SHOW IT THIS PROCESS IS FOLLOWED TO SOME EXTENT IN NEARLY EVERY STATE AND MANY OF THE STATES THAT ARE REPORTED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO BE WITHOUT SINKING FUNDS ARE STEADILY REDUCING THEIR DEBTS BY CANCELATION IN THE WHOLE FIELD OF STUDY COVERED HOWEVER IMPERFECTLY IN THIS REVIEW THERE IS ONE PARTICULAR FEATURE THAT SHOULD BE RECOM 227 35THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MENDED TO THE ATTENTION OF THE PRIVATE INVESTOR IT WILL BE FOUND IN THE LAWS OF MASSACHUSETTS WITH RESPECT TO THE SINKING FUNDS THAT STATE PROVIDES THAT WHEN ITS BONDS ARE SOLD AT A PREMIUM THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE PREMIUM GOES INTO THE SINKING FUNDS THAT LAW IS A RECOGNITION OF A PRINCIPLE THAT TOO FEW PRIVATE INVESTORS UNDER STAND THE PRINCIPLE WHICH IS THE CHIEF APPLICATION OF THE SINKING FUND PRINCIPLE TO THE INVESTMENTS OF THE PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE STATED BRIEFLY BONDS BOUGHT AT A PREMIUM FOR INVESTMENT ARE WASTING INVEST MENTS AND UNLESS THE BUYER ESTABLISHES A SINKING FUND AGAINST THE PREMIUM PAID THEY ARE NECESSARILY LOSING INVESTMENTS IF HELD TO MATURITY LET US TAKE AS AN EXAMPLE A 6 PER CENT BOND FOR IOOOO BOUGHT IN MAY I907 FOR 12000 AND DUE MAY I 1927 IF THE WHOLE ANNUAL INCOME OF 600 IS CONSIDERED INCOME AND SPENT THE INVESTOR WILL FIND WHEN THE BOND IS PAID OFF THAT HE HAS SPENT AS CURRENT REVENUE 2000 OF HIS PRINCIPAL OF COURSE EVERY MAN WHO KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT INVESTMENTS KNOWS THIS FACT BUT UNFORTUNATELY FAR TOO MANY INVESTORS SEEM TO FORGET IT FOLLOWING THIS EXAMPLE LET US DETERMINE HOW MUCH SHOULD BE SET ASIDE OUT OF EACH SEMIANNUAL INTEREST PAYMENT AS A SINKING FUND TO EQUALIZE THE WASTE IN THE VALUE OF THE BOND THE FOLLOWING IS A PARTIAL TABLE TO COVER INVESTMENTS AT 4 PER CENT 5 PER CENT AND 6 PER CENT FOR PERIODS FROM 10 YEARS TO 25 YEARS IT IS BASED UPON THE IDEA OF WITHDRAWING A CERTAIN FIXED PART OF THE REVENUE EACH HALF YEAR AND DEPOSITING IT IN A SAVINGS BANK OR TRUST COMPANY TO RECEIVE INTEREST AT THE RATE STATED COMPOUNDED EVERY SIX MONTHS THROUGH THE PERIOD STATED FOR CONVENIENCE THE TABLE SHOWS THE AMOUNT TO BE DEPOSITED TO ABSORB A LOSS OF IOOO DURING THE PERIOD NAMED FOUR FIVE SIX YEARS PER CENT PER CENT PER CENT TEN   4035 3819 3613 ELEVEN

SUPPLY THE TABLES NEEDED BY THE INVESTOR TO ENABLE HIM TO CALCULATE FOR HIMSELF THE SINKING FUNDS HE SHOULD HAVE ESTABLISHED AGAINST HIS INVESTMENTS AT A PREMIUM 229

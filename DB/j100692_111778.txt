Reversion of Serieses By J J SYLVESTER Esq FRS Received January 25 1855 With a view to its publication in the Proceedings of the Society I take occasion to communicate the result of my investigations as far as they have yet extended into the general theory of differential trans formations containing a complete and general solution of the import ant problem of expanding a given partial differential coefficient of a function in respect of one system of independent variables in terms of the partial differential coefficients thereof in respect to a second system of independent variables each respectively given as explicit functions of the first set This question may be shown to be exactly coincident with that of the reversion of simultaneous serieses proposed by Jacobi which may be thus stated given n1 quantities each expressed by rational infinite serieses as functions of n others required to express any one of the first set in a rational infinite series in terms of the other n of the same set This question has only been resolved by Jacobi for a particular case the result hereunder given for the trans formation of differentialIcoefficients contains the solution of the gene ral question My method of investigation is entirely different from that adopted by the great Jacobi and I hope in a short time to be able to lay it in a complete form before the Society and probably to add a solution of the still more general question comprising the re version of serieses as a particular case viz the question of express220 ing any one of n quantities connected by m equations in terms of any nm others of the same Let there be any number of variables say u v w of which x y z  are given functions it is required to expand X dy dZ in terms of the partial differential coefficients of x yy z in respect of u v w Form the determinant dx dx dx dy dy dy Wu Wv dw dz dz dz du dI dw which call J The required expansion will contain in each term an integer nume rical coefficient a power of  one factor of the form IdPdq dV 1td17 1u and otherfactorsdo thedfor and other factors of the form  dm d dv P kduJ kdv dwJ d8l drm djzY d AIrd 2 d aPt duJ VdvJ Vdw Let the latter class of factors be distinguished into two sets those where lmnl lii O m0 nO or 1O m1 n0 or 10 nO nl which I shall call unidifferential factors and those in which Imn 7 1 which I shall call pluridifferential factors First then as to the form of the general term abstracting from221 the numerical coefficient and the unidifferential factors except of course so far as they enter into J This will be as follows  d 1

have L1L2L3M2lM2M3N1N2N3Pqr fghAeeQe3 and as tLhe sum of any group of indices 1 m n must he not less than 2 we have fghee2de3pq2r not less than 2e2e22e3 so that ee2e3 must not exceeedfgkpqr furthermore p y q  must not exceed fg  hi and finally wf ghele2e3 1 WVe may first take e1 e2  e3E giving to ZE in succession all inteer values fromfghtto 2f 2g2h and find all possible so lutions of this equation with permutations between the values of el e2 e3 2 We may then take pqrs giving s in succession all in teger values from 1 to f g  h and find all possible solutions of this equation with permutations betweeaf g h 3 We may then take LMNfghEs and find all the values of L M N with permutations allowable between the values of L M N222 4 We may then take LI L2 L3 L MlM2M3M N1 N2 N3N and solve these several equations in every way possible with per mutations as before 5 We must take 1 1 ellL Iml2Mi   elm Ml nln2nl   elflN 1212 e212L m22m2  e2m2M2 In2 2n2 e22N2 11 213  e31aI3 Im3m3  e

third sets taken each per se and subject to the condition that every such sum as l i min must be greater than unity Every possible system of values of these nine sets will furnish a corresponding pluridifferential part to the general term Next as to the unidifferential part we may form the quantity dy dz dy dzXdy dz dy dzyJdydz dydz V Wdv dw dw dvJ kdw du du dwJ kdu dv dv dwJ dz dx dz dxX2dz

be solved in every possible manner with permutations between the members of the X set the u set and the v set Finally we have to consider the numerical coefficient To give a perfect representation of this we must ascertain what identi ties exist in the factors of the pluridifferential part Let us sup pose that one set of operators upon xv is repeated 0 times another223 02 times and so on giving rise to the powers 01 020 in the x line Similarly form 01 02 Ip from the y line and 4 2   from the z line Then the numerical part of the general term will be HIXl PI V1HX2p2  v2IX3 3  P3 HX1 Jp1l

has been set out in the above pages for the case of  a function of three variables but the reader can have no difficulty in extending the statement to any number In the case of a single variable the formula can easily be identified with that given by Burmans law It is noticeable that the deter mlinant above written is of the form Apqr  Bpq  Cqr  Dqrp Epe  Fq  Gr the part independent of p q r being easily seen to vanish More over A B C D E F G H are all essentially positive so that D can only vanish except for pO rO qO by virtue of one con dition at least more than the number of the

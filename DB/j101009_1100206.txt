j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1100206,Seaboard  Roanoke Railroad Co v Hickey Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond February 4 1904,i245918,1048 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April S killed my beef It was held that there being no colloquium the words not necessarily imputing a felony they cannot be extended in their meaning by the innuendo The facts in Tyree v Harrison 100 Va 540 resembled those in the principal case A letter from a citizen to the mayor of a city informing him of the alleged misconduct of a policeman was held to be privileged and accordingly malice would not be implied and the burden was placed on plaintiff to prove malice in fact further that it is the province of the jury to determine whether the privilege has been abused and violent language disproportionate to the occasion may overcome the weight of the privilege and raise an inference of malice Citing Strode v Clement 90 Va 556 The chief point of interest in the principal case arises from the rulings upon the sufficiency of the declara tion The first count as to the words imputing the crime of statutory embezzlement is adjudged insufficient beyond the hope of resurrection by the quickening influences of the innuendo The second count imputing to the plaintiff conduct which in the judgment of good citizens is cal culated to injure his reputation and prejudice him among his fellows is held good With this case and Payne v Tancil cited the pleader has fair notice of the requisite allegations in an action of this nature Nor will he overlook in drawing a demurrer to any declaration of more than one count the suggestion in the third paragraph of the opinion of stating in terms that it is to each count as well as to the whole SEABOARD  ROANOKE RAILROAD Co  HICKEY Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond February 4 1904 Absent Cardwell J 1 INSTRUCTIONSEvidence to support It is error to give an instruction when there is no evidence to support it 2 RAILROADSNegligenceCase at bar The evidence in the case at bar shows that an intelligent boy upwards of eight years of age who was familiar with railroad trains and who had been repeatedly warned to keep off of moving cars was injured by an instantaneous act of gross negligence and misconduct on his part in attempting to board a moving train and that the defendant company and its servants were free from all fault or negligence in connection with accident complained of and hence there can be no recovery for the resulting injury Error to a judgment of the IHustings Court of the city of Ports mouth in an action of trespass on the case wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the case  Reported by M P Burks State ReporterSEABOARD  ROANOKE R CO V HICKEY G Hatton for the plaintiff in error Jeffries  Lawless for the defendant in error WHIITTLE J delivered the opinion of the court This action was brought by defendant in error to recover dam ages from the plaintiff in error who was the defendant in the court below for personal injuries alleged to have been inflicted upon him by the negligence of the defendant The specific allegation of the amended declaration is that during a carnival in the city of Portsmouth the defendant while running a freight train over its tracks along one of the streets of that city negligently permitted the plaintiff a boy eight years and four months of age to attempt to climb and ride upon one of its cars  that while so attempting to climb upon said car and while riding thereon plaintiff was by the default carelessness recklessness negligence willfulness and improper conduct of the defendant violently thrown to the ground and under the cars by means whereof his left leg was so fractured and injured that it had to be amputated The jury found a verdict for the plaintiff and assessed his dam ages at 6000 whereupon the defendant submitted a motion for a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence and for other reasons  but the court over ruled the motion and rendered judgment for the plaintiff and the defendant excepted The view taken by this court is that there was a total failure on the part of the plaintiff to trace actionable negligence to the defendant and that in no aspect of the case was he entitled to a verdict  and that readers a detailed notice of other assignments of error unnecessary All the instructions given by the court were in one form or another predicated upon the supposed negligence of the defend ant and as there was no evidence tending to establish that fact upon familiar principles the instructions ought not to have been given A brief statement of the circumstances and uncontroverted facts bearing upon the casualty will show the utter groundless ness of plaintiffs demand At the time of the accident a freight train of the defendant consisting of three box cars attached to the rear end of the train 1904 10499 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER thirteen flat cars and an enginewas being propelled along Crawford street As the train was passing a  baby stand around which a crowd had assembled the plaintiff ran out from the throng and attempted to catch hold of a cuff or socket intended to receive a stanchion on the hindermost flat car when he slipped and fell between the two rear trucks one of the wheels of which passed over his leg and inflicted the injury complained of Fisher the only witness for the plaintiff who saw the accident was stand ing within ten yards of him when he fell His attention was first directed to plaintiff by observing his arm raised and seeing him fall underneath the car Witness ran to him at once and plaintiff drew up the injured leg and was in the act of stretching out the other leg when he was drawn from between the wheels While Fishers testimony is not very clear and differs from that of other witnesses in that he expressed the opinion that plaintiff was not attempting to jump on the car when he fell it involves no question of veracity between them Considered in the light of other evi dence bearing directly upon the accident it would seem that Fisher observed the plaintiff for the first time after he had failed to grasp the cuff on the flat car and was in the act of falling However that may be his statement that he did not think plaintiff was endeavoring to jump on the car which was but the expression of an opinion is opposed to the allegation of the amended declara tion the oftrepeated admissions of the plaintiff and to all the other evidence in the case upon that point But if his version of the occurrence were accepted it would not affect the result because while it tends to exonerate the plaintiff from willful mis conduct it in no wise imputes negligence to the defendant The only member of the trains crew who saw the accident was a switchman and brakeman who was standing on the top of the middle box car He testified that a number of boys were attempt ing to get on the train and that while a policeman was trying to keep them off on one side he was similarly engaged on the other He saw the plaintiff jump and attempt to clutch the cuff or socket on the flat car when he lost his hold and fell He also saw some one seize him and immediately signal the engineer but failed to attract his attention The occurrence was instantaneous and after plaintiffs danger became known to the brakeman it was impossible for him to have averted the accident 1050 AprilSEABOARD  ROANOKE R CO V HICKEY It was likewise in evidence that the plaintiff was an intelligent boy that he lived on a street along which the railroad was located and was accustomed to trains and knew of the danger he incurred in attempting to ride on them He had received repeated warn ings on the subject and been punished for disregarding them A year or two prior to the accident one of the yard conductors who lived next door to plaintiff remonstrated with him about riding on these trains and several days after the accident plain tiff remarked to the physician who attended him that he would not have been hurt if he had heeded the conductors advice He had been ordered off another train of the defendant by a police man and by one of his own witnesses not more than half an hour before the accident Notwithstanding these reiterated admonitions while the train in question was passing he endeavored to persuade one of his playmates to go with him and ride on the cars and despite the refusal and expostulation of his friend made the attempt which terminated so disastrously It cannot be affirmed of the plaintiff that he did not possess sufficient knowledge and discretion to understand the nature of his act and the peril he was encountering But the case does not depend upon the capacity or incapacity of the plaintiff to commit negligence The primary question is has the defendant been guilty of negligence  And that question upon the evidence admits of but one answer To sustain the verdict of the jury in this case would present the anomaly of subjecting a defendant wholly free from fault to the payment of damages by way of compensation for an injury to a plaintiff which was the direct result of his own gross negligence and misconduct It was suggested that the defendant was negligent with respect to the length and speed of the train and in failing to ring the bell Of that contention it is sufficient to observe that no such grounds of negligence are alleged in the declaration and if alleged and proved there would have been no causal connection whatever between them and the accident For these reasons the lower court erred in overruling the motion of the defendant to set aside the verdict and for that error its judgment must be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial Reversed EDITORIAL NOTEThis case presents the converse of the question passed upon in Richmond Traction Company v Wilkinson Va 43 S E 622 1904 10511052 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April and is its logical complement There plaintiff a boy seven years of age boarded a street car not as a passenger but as a trespasser and after it had started the conductor ordered him to jump off which he did falling upon a pile of sand and rolling thence under the car and receiving injuries Instructions were approved that knowledge by defendants employees that plaintiff had boarded the runningboard of the car and that he was in a dangerous situation made it their duty to slow up sufficiently to permit plaintiff to leave the car in safety and that their failure so to do was negligence C dt O Ry Co v Rogers 100 Va 324 in regard to the duty of a railroad company as to trespassers was invoked in behalf of the Traction Company but the court declined to go into the question as to whether the rule therein pronounced applies to street railways in a populous city where children of tender years are constantly coming in dangerous proximity to street cars the facts of the case not calling for a ruling upon the point The court distinctly approved the proposition as to both infants and adults that if A through his negli gence or default puts B in a position of immediate danger real or apparent and B through a sudden impulse of fear makes a movement to escape the danger and in so doing accidentally receives another and a different injury from that threatened by the negligence of A he may recover damages of A whose negligence or default is the proximate cause of the injury Citing R d D R Co v Morris 31 Gratt 200 Dingee v Unrue 98 Va 251  Richmond R  E Co v Hudgins 100 Va 409 and other cases The justice of the decision in the principal case seems manifest It would be hard to foretell the consequences of an opposite ruling While we endeavor to do no more in these notes than discuss the law as it is we are nevertheless within our limitations when we say that the tender ness of the law to infants has been carried by the courts of the country in some instances to the point oflet us say softness No one will dispute the great unwritten principle of AngloSaxon jurisprudence that boys will be boys and that therefore willful injuries to person or property inflicted by them are absolutely damnum absque injuria and beyond the remedies of the law that accordingly they may with impunity break windows pull down fences deface dwellings obstruct thoroughfares and generally inspire in a community a feeling of terrorism which differs only in degree from that occasioned by the presence of Molly Maguires or any other form of organized outlawry A decision like this which denies the right to visit the consequences of mere boyish exuberance of spirits and athletic ambition upon parties in no degree responsible for the result cannot fail to be regarded as both timely and commendable

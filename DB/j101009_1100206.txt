FIRST DIRECTED TO PLAINTIFF BY OBSERVING HIS ARM RAISED AND SEEING HIM FALL UNDERNEATH THE CAR WITNESS RAN TO HIM AT ONCE AND PLAINTIFF DREW UP THE INJURED LEG AND WAS IN THE ACT OF STRETCHING OUT THE OTHER LEG WHEN HE WAS DRAWN FROM BETWEEN THE WHEELS WHILE FISHERS TESTIMONY IS NOT VERY CLEAR AND DIFFERS FROM THAT OF OTHER WITNESSES IN THAT HE EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT PLAINTIFF WAS NOT ATTEMPTING TO JUMP ON THE CAR WHEN HE FELL IT INVOLVES NO QUESTION OF VERACITY BETWEEN THEM CONSIDERED IN THE LIGHT OF OTHER EVI DENCE BEARING DIRECTLY UPON THE ACCIDENT IT WOULD SEEM THAT FISHER OBSERVED THE PLAINTIFF FOR THE FIRST TIME AFTER HE HAD FAILED TO GRASP THE CUFF ON THE FLAT CAR AND WAS IN THE ACT OF FALLING HOWEVER THAT MAY BE HIS STATEMENT THAT HE DID NOT THINK PLAINTIFF WAS ENDEAVORING TO JUMP ON THE CAR WHICH WAS BUT THE EXPRESSION OF AN OPINION IS OPPOSED TO THE ALLEGATION OF THE AMENDED DECLARA TION THE OFTREPEATED ADMISSIONS OF THE PLAINTIFF AND TO ALL THE OTHER EVIDENCE IN THE CASE UPON THAT POINT BUT IF HIS VERSION OF THE OCCURRENCE WERE ACCEPTED IT WOULD NOT AFFECT THE RESULT BECAUSE WHILE IT TENDS TO EXONERATE THE PLAINTIFF FROM WILLFUL MIS CONDUCT IT IN NO WISE IMPUTES NEGLIGENCE TO THE DEFENDANT THE ONLY MEMBER OF THE TRAINS CREW WHO SAW THE ACCIDENT WAS A SWITCHMAN AND BRAKEMAN WHO WAS STANDING ON THE TOP OF THE MIDDLE BOX CAR HE TESTIFIED THAT A NUMBER OF BOYS WERE ATTEMPT ING TO GET ON THE TRAIN AND THAT WHILE A POLICEMAN WAS TRYING TO KEEP THEM OFF ON ONE SIDE HE WAS SIMILARLY ENGAGED ON THE OTHER HE SAW THE PLAINTIFF JUMP AND ATTEMPT TO CLUTCH THE CUFF OR SOCKET ON THE FLAT CAR WHEN HE LOST HIS HOLD AND FELL HE ALSO SAW SOME ONE SEIZE HIM AND IMMEDIATELY SIGNAL THE ENGINEER BUT FAILED TO ATTRACT HIS ATTENTION THE OCCURRENCE WAS INSTANTANEOUS AND AFTER PLAINTIFFS DANGER BECAME KNOWN TO THE BRAKEMAN IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE FOR HIM TO HAVE AVERTED THE ACCIDENT 1050 APRILSEABOARD  ROANOKE R CO V HICKEY IT WAS LIKEWISE IN EVIDENCE THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS AN INTELLIGENT BOY THAT HE LIVED ON A STREET ALONG WHICH THE RAILROAD WAS LOCATED AND WAS ACCUSTOMED TO TRAINS AND KNEW OF THE DANGER HE INCURRED IN ATTEMPTING TO RIDE ON THEM HE HAD RECEIVED REPEATED WARN INGS ON THE SUBJECT AND BEEN PUNISHED FOR DISREGARDING THEM A YEAR OR TWO PRIOR TO THE ACCIDENT ONE OF THE YARD CONDUCTORS WHO LIVED NEXT DOOR TO PLAINTIFF REMONSTRATED WITH HIM ABOUT RIDING ON THESE TRAINS AND SEVERAL DAYS AFTER THE ACCIDENT PLAIN TIFF REMARKED TO THE PHYSICIAN WHO ATTENDED HIM THAT HE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN HURT IF HE HAD HEEDED THE CONDUCTORS ADVICE HE HAD BEEN ORDERED OFF ANOTHER TRAIN OF THE DEFENDANT BY A POLICE MAN AND BY ONE OF HIS OWN WITNESSES NOT MORE THAN HALF AN HOUR BEFORE THE ACCIDENT NOTWITHSTANDING THESE REITERATED ADMONITIONS WHILE THE TRAIN IN QUESTION WAS PASSING HE ENDEAVORED TO PERSUADE ONE OF HIS PLAYMATES TO GO WITH HIM AND RIDE ON THE CARS AND DESPITE THE REFUSAL AND EXPOSTULATION OF HIS FRIEND MADE THE ATTEMPT WHICH TERMINATED SO DISASTROUSLY IT CANNOT BE AFFIRMED OF THE PLAINTIFF THAT HE DID NOT POSSESS SUFFICIENT KNOWLEDGE AND DISCRETION TO UNDERSTAND THE NATURE OF HIS ACT AND THE PERIL HE WAS ENCOUNTERING BUT THE CASE DOES NOT DEPEND UPON THE CAPACITY OR INCAPACITY OF THE PLAINTIFF TO COMMIT NEGLIGENCE THE PRIMARY QUESTION IS HAS THE DEFENDANT BEEN GUILTY OF NEGLIGENCE  AND THAT QUESTION UPON THE EVIDENCE ADMITS OF BUT ONE ANSWER TO SUSTAIN THE VERDICT OF THE JURY IN THIS CASE WOULD PRESENT THE ANOMALY OF SUBJECTING A DEFENDANT WHOLLY FREE FROM FAULT TO THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES BY WAY OF COMPENSATION FOR AN INJURY TO A PLAINTIFF WHICH WAS THE DIRECT RESULT OF HIS OWN GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND MISCONDUCT IT WAS SUGGESTED THAT THE DEFENDANT WAS NEGLIGENT WITH RESPECT TO THE LENGTH AND SPEED OF THE TRAIN AND IN FAILING TO RING THE BELL OF THAT CONTENTION IT IS SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE THAT NO SUCH GROUNDS OF NEGLIGENCE ARE ALLEGED IN THE DECLARATION AND IF ALLEGED AND PROVED THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO CAUSAL CONNECTION WHATEVER BETWEEN THEM AND THE ACCIDENT FOR THESE REASONS THE LOWER COURT ERRED IN OVERRULING THE MOTION OF THE DEFENDANT TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT AND FOR THAT ERROR ITS JUDGMENT MUST BE REVERSED AND THE CASE REMANDED FOR A NEW TRIAL REVERSED EDITORIAL NOTETHIS CASE PRESENTS THE CONVERSE OF THE QUESTION PASSED UPON IN RICHMOND TRACTION COMPANY V WILKINSON VA 43 S E 622 1904 10511052 9

ORDERED HIM TO JUMP OFF WHICH HE DID FALLING UPON A PILE OF SAND AND ROLLING THENCE UNDER THE CAR AND RECEIVING INJURIES INSTRUCTIONS WERE APPROVED THAT KNOWLEDGE BY DEFENDANTS EMPLOYEES THAT PLAINTIFF HAD BOARDED THE RUNNINGBOARD OF THE CAR AND THAT HE WAS IN A DANGEROUS SITUATION MADE IT THEIR DUTY TO SLOW UP SUFFICIENTLY TO PERMIT PLAINTIFF TO LEAVE THE CAR IN SAFETY AND THAT THEIR FAILURE SO TO DO WAS NEGLIGENCE C DT O RY CO V ROGERS 100 VA 324 IN REGARD TO THE DUTY OF A RAILROAD COMPANY AS TO TRESPASSERS WAS INVOKED IN BEHALF OF THE TRACTION COMPANY BUT THE COURT DECLINED TO GO INTO THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER THE RULE THEREIN PRONOUNCED APPLIES TO STREET RAILWAYS IN A POPULOUS CITY WHERE CHILDREN OF TENDER YEARS ARE CONSTANTLY COMING IN DANGEROUS PROXIMITY TO STREET CARS THE FACTS OF THE CASE NOT CALLING FOR A RULING UPON THE POINT THE COURT DISTINCTLY APPROVED THE PROPOSITION AS TO BOTH INFANTS AND ADULTS THAT IF A THROUGH HIS NEGLI GENCE OR DEFAULT PUTS B IN A POSITION OF IMMEDIATE DANGER REAL OR APPARENT AND B THROUGH A SUDDEN IMPULSE OF FEAR MAKES A MOVEMENT TO ESCAPE THE DANGER AND IN SO DOING ACCIDENTALLY RECEIVES ANOTHER AND A DIFFERENT INJURY FROM

ENDEAVOR TO DO NO MORE IN THESE NOTES THAN DISCUSS THE LAW AS IT IS WE ARE NEVERTHELESS WITHIN OUR LIMITATIONS WHEN WE SAY THAT THE TENDER NESS OF THE LAW TO INFANTS HAS BEEN CARRIED BY THE COURTS OF

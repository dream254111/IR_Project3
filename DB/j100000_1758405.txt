recognition for his views would be to send preparations to be examined by histologists of experience in re search The discovery of the reticular charac ter of protoplasm is very interesting and our author deserves praise for insisting on this point but we find in his volume little to awaken the expectation that it will earn rec ognition for the  bioplasson doctrine which in our opinion is not shown to deserve serious consideration although it is possible or even probable that in certain cases a secondary connection is established betweeii the proto plasm of adjacent cells It should be added that special consider ation of the pathological chapters has been purposely omitted from this notice as inappro priate here EUROPEAN ORTHOPTERA Prodromus der europdischen Orthoptera Von C BBUNNER VON WATTENWYL Leipzig Engel mann 1882 32 466 p 11 pl map 8 THE activity of systematists within the past thirty years has rarely received a more striking proof than in the publication of the volume before us When H Fischer published his classic work on European Orthoptera the num ber of recognized species on that continent was less than two hundred and fifty Brunner one of our leading writers now places the number at very nearly double the former figure The increase is particularly marked in the Locusta riae which have nearly trebled1 Already while Fischers work was passing through the press Fieber was making discoveries in the little worked region of southeastern Europe and of late years Bolivar and others have shown how little the Iberian peninsula was known yet one would scarcely have looked for such strik ing additions in so old a field as Europe and among such bulky insects as the Orthoptera Meanwhile there has been great activity in the study of Orthoptera of other parts of the world and it may safely be said that if the number of European Orthoptera has doubled that of the world at large has quadrupled in the same period This has entailed much re vision and remodelling in the work of which Brunner Saussure and the gifted and lamented Stal have performed the most honorable part though they may have been outdone in diluted quantity by Walker 1 Brunner credits Ephippigera with fortynine species of which only ten are given by Fischer The additions are largely from Bolivars work in Spain NCE 605 There was need then that some one should crystallize the methods of recent days for a region so abounding in workers as Europe This Brunner has now attempted He disclaims at the outset any attempt at a monograph Europe lie rightly says is no natural province and the Orthoptera in the sense of the older naturalists as used in his work no natural order For the convenience only of the numerous workers in this region upon the somewhat heterogeneous groups which have been classed under Orthoptera he issues this Prodromus It is excellent as a systematic review The groups are clearly and succinctly defined but the work is mainly of value in a faunal sense There is no superfluity of lan guage analytical tables abound the balance of parts is admirable every genus is well illus trated and as an expression and synthesis of current toxonomic views it will serve a most useful purpose But the biology of these in sects is entirely and purposely overlooked and there is yet room for some one working upon the excellent model of Fischer but with the light the newer biological studies have given to produce a work which shall be classi cal and far more fruitful than this can be MA CHINER Y AT PARIS 1878 Rapports dujury international groupe VI classe 54 Les machines et les appareils de la mecha nique generale Par M HIRSCH ingenieur des ponts et chauss6es Paris Imprimerie nationale 1883 8 M HIRSCH has collated and edited the notes of the members of the section of the jury of which he was secretary and compiled a very extensive and detailed report with the addition of considerable matter original with himself thus making a valuable work of the official report The principal classes of exhibits here examined are steam engines and boilers with their accessories divided into stationary and locomotive engines and portable machines hotair engines electric and other motors hydraulic machinery compressedair appara tus machinery of transmission machinery of transportation dynamometers and miscellane ous parts of machinery There seem to have been no steamboilers or accessories from the United States except the Hancock inspirator which is well noticed The engines of Corliss and Wheelock are studied at length and appar ently with very satisfactory results the latter taking the grande medaille A large number of engines were exhibited copies of the American Corliss engine which has evidently606 S CIE become the best standard among European makers Among the hotair engines that of Rider is given a leading place and is fully described It is commended for its simplicity its quiet ness in action its regularity and its careful design Stows flexible shafting is noticed as one of the characteristic products of American inge nuity It consists of two oppositely twisted helices of steel wire the one enclosing the other and both covered with a flexible sheath The device is recommended for the transmis sion of motion around a corner These Amer ican exhibits were all properly commended in the award of premiums by the jury Among other important exhibits from Euro pean countries were various forms of safety boilers  the singular modification of the injector of Giffard which by means of tlhe energy of the exhauststeam performs the func tions of the airpump in the steamengine several forms of compound engine  Halls pul someter which is a modification of the Savery steamengine of nearly two hundred years ago with automatically working valves  an Amer ican invention the gasengine of Otto which is said to have exceptional efficiency the Sagebien vertical waterwheel which is claimed to have extraordinary performance the indi cator of Deprez which gives a diagram from the fastest engines and many other important inventions One remarkable feature of the exhibition was the absence of valueless and eccentric devices This point of difference in contrasting the exhibition with those which preceded it is attributed largely to the progress of technical education In studying progress it is noted that the gain is considerable in every direction In the production of steam the more general use of  heaters  of the feedwater is observable the use of tubular and of the  safety  forms of boiler is increasing superheating is oftener practised better material and workmanship are seen In steamengine practice the use of higher steam of greater expansion the adoption of two types exclusively  the com pound of the Wolff type and the American forms of singlecylinder engines  greater speed of piston and of rotation and the use of better material and superior workmanship are the characteristics of recent practice Rotary engines are given up Air and gas engines are extensively used but only for small powers Among the hydraulic motors the turbines are principally used and have attained great per NCE VOL I No 21 fection in practice as in theory Aerostation has made no great progress notwithstanding the interest which it continually awakens American exhibiters distinguished them selves by the boldness and the ingenuity of their designs and by their entire independence of tradition Their devices are adapted pre cisely and effectively to their work  Les Americains sattachaient avec energie a

MINOR BOOK NOTICES Conversiontables of metric and British or United States weights and measures with an introduction By ROBERT H THURSTON AM CE New York John Wiley  Sons 1883 83 p 8 IN the introduction the requirements of any system of weights and measures are given There is a brief history of the English and French systems and the supposed advantages of the metric are stated The difficulties and annoyances arising during the change from the English yard and pound to the metre and gram are suggested as sufficient reason for this book In the second part containing the tables of conversion the units of length mass stress work and heat temperature and baro metric pressure are defined A chapter is devoted to c G s units The tables are full numerous and seem to be well arranged and will without doubt be found useful by those having occasion to make measurements This book forms part of a treatise in three volumes on the Materials of engineering by the same author How the great prevailing winds and oceancurrents are produced and how they affect the temperature and dimensity of lands and seas By C A M TABER Boston Williams 1882 82 p 12 This pamphlet by Capt Taber of Wakefield Mass gives a practical seamans views on the origin of winds and oceancurrents and sug gests certain very hypothetical causes for gla cial climate The fundamental errors of the work lie in a misconception of the suns action in producing and the earths effect in deflect ing the winds and in a tendency to refer apparently simple effects to single instead of composite causes The other side of some of the questions here raised is presented in Tchiatcheffs or Rollands descriptions of the Sahara and Woeikoffs and Hanns articles on the general atmospheric circulation

Work Council Young Womens Christian Association A million and a half men were in the American Army a year after this country entered the war A million and a half women at the same time were employed on war orders in factories A million other women were being speeded up in industries affected by the war As the size of the army increases the number of women in industry increases at the same rate Each man who is withdrawn from factory work must be replaced by a woman This vast in dustrial army of women forms the second line of defense This sudden influx brings about a shifting and changing of the women already wageearners They as well as the newcomers find themselves in strange environments Ten million women in this country are now facing the wageearners problems The Young Womens Christian Association feels strongly its responsibility toward all women affected by the war Its fifty years experience in housing feeding and recreation is brought to bear upon the situation The War Work Council now numbering 208Y W C A WAR WORK 209 a hundred and thirty members was called into existence in June 1917 The members are chosen from the whole United States Its officers are Mrs James Stewart

girls will be employed in some of these cantonments The women employed in the federal industrial reservations include all types and ages They are teachers high school girls and industrial girls many foreigners are employed Life in a munition cantonment is necessarily abnormal The girls have no responsibilities outside their working hours In ad dition many of them must face the problems of leaving home of loneliness of dangerous fatigue of lack of suitable recreation and the responsibility of family support Under such conditions it be comes especially important to fill the leisure time with constructive continuous community recreation and service Local industrial service clubs are organized in each center and all the clubs are in cluded in the great industrial army Model recreation buildings are being put up These contain a large livingroom smaller sitting rooms living quarters for the secretaries a gymnasium in one wing and a cafeteria in the other One executive secretary is appointed to each center in addition to a recreation leader and often an assistant secretary Women war workers in many cases will meet industrial as well 15THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY as personal problems Changing industrial conditions may mean in some places unemployment unaccustomed tasks irregular hours unhygienic conditions speeding and rush work overtime under guise of patriotism and even the repeal of laws governing hours of work and age of workers Conditions like these invariably result in unsettled standards obliterating high ideals letting down per sonal restraint and permitting loose social relationships Wherever bad industrial and social conditions prevail the labor turnover is extensive efficiency is diminished and output falls off To prevent this disaster the Y W C A cooperates with em ployers and with girls to uphold high standards Leaders with the right knowledge of industrial problems are being trained in courses conducted by local associations industrial councils and at the Na tional Training School in New York City During the summer the Y W C A cooperated with Bryn Mawr College in a course for industrial supervisors under the leadership of Dr Susan Kingsbury The widespread education of the general public in industrial standards is necessary to the protection of women their safety their health and their moral welfare The association through all its many avenues impresses upon people in general that efficiency is dependent upon the eighthour day one days rest in seven minimum wage equal pay for equal work collective bargaining as expressed in

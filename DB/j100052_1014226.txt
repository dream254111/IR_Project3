J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014226,THE CAUSE AND PROCESS OF INFLATION,I242678,THE CAUSE AND PROCESS OF INFLATION BY GEORGE E ROBERTS VICEPRESIDENT NATIONAL CITY BANK NEW YORK CITY CREDIT EXPANSION AND PRICES THE GENERAL LEVEL OF COMMODITY PRICES HAS RISEN SINCE 1914 TO FIGURES ABOUT DOUBLE THOSE OF THAT YEAR AND BANK LOANS AND BANK DEPOSITS HAVE RISEN IN ABOUT THE SAME PROPORTION WHAT IS THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF CURRENCY OR BANK CREDIT AND PRICES WE HAVE ONE GROUP OF PEOPLE CONTENDING THAT THE RISE OF PRICES HAS RESULTED FROM THE INCREASED USE OF CREDIT AND ANOTHER GROUP HOLDING THAT THE HIGHER PRICE LEVEL HAS COMPELLED THE EXPANSION OF CREDIT IN OTHER WORDS ONE SIDE TREATS THE HIGHER PRICES AS A RESULT AND THE OTHER SIDE TREATS THEM AS A CAUSE EVIDENTLY THERE IS A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PRICE LEVEL AND THE VOLUME OF THE MEDIA OF EXCHANGE AND AT LEAST SUPERFICIAL REASONS MAY BE FOUND TO SUPPORT EITHER SIDE OF THE ARGUMENT ONCE THE JOINT MOVEMENT IS STARTED THE CONTROVERSY IS SOMEWHAT LIKE THE OLD ONE AS TO WHICH CAME FIRST THE EGG OR THE HEN THE PRINCIPLE INVOLVED IS THE SAME AS IN THE HISTORIC CONTROVERSY OVER THE DEPRECIATION OF BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES ABOUT ONE HUNDRED YEARS AGO SPECIE PAYMENTS HAD BEEN SUSPENDED SO LONG THAT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BANK OF ENGLAND NOTES PRICES AND THE GOLD STANDARD HAD BECOME OBSCURE THOSE WHO DEFENDED THE POLICY OF CONTINUED SUSPENSION ARGUED THAT THE SITUATION WAS PERFECTLY NORMAL AS FAR AS THE OPERATIONS OF THE BANK WERE CONCERNED THE ONLY TROUBLE WAS THAT IN THE EXISTING STATE OF TRADE THE NEED TO MAKE PAY MENTS ON THE CONTINENT CAUSED GOLD TO COMMAND A PREMIUM OVER BANK NOTES THEY INSISTED THAT THERE WAS NO INFLA TION OF THE CIRCULATING MEDIUM NO MORE NOTES WERE BEING ISSUED THAN WERE REQUIRED FOR THE TRANSACTION OF BUSINESS AND THE BANK WAS MAKING NO LOANS EXCEPT FOR PROPER AND NECESSARY BUSI NESS PURPOSES HENCE THERE WAS NOTH ING TO DO ABOUT IT THEY DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEY HAD LOST THEIR BEARINGS THEY WERE JUDGING THE NEED FOR CREDIT BY THE DEMANDS OF AN ABNORMAL SITUATION ENGLAND WAS OFF THE GOLD BASIS THE PAPER CURRENCY WAS INFLATED AND DEPRECIATED PRICES WERE INFLATED AND OF COURSE THE DEMAND FOR CREDIT WAS JUST AS GREAT AS THOUGH CONDITIONS HAD BEEN NORMAL THE FAMOUS BULLION REPORT BY LORD LIVER POOLS COMMITTEE POINTED OUT THE FALLACY OF JUDGING THE STATE OF CREDIT OR OF CURRENCY MERELY BY THE AMOUNT RE QUIRED TO CARRY ON BUSINESS AT THE EXISTING LEVEL OF PRICES THAT CRITERION IS UNSAFE UNLESS THE PRICE LEVEL IS RELATED TO THE GOLD STANDARD OR SOME OTHER CONCRETE STANDARD TO ALLOW THE VOLUME OF CURRENCY TO BE REGULATED BY THE DEMAND WHILE THE DEMAND IN TURN IS DEPENDENT UPON VALUES AND THE VALUES ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE VOLUME IS TRAVELING IN A CIRCLE MEANS OF REDUCING INFLATION SURELY THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION THAT THE PURCHASING POWER OF A CURRENCY WHICH HAS NO DEFINITE RELATION TO GOLD OR TO ANY CONCRETE STANDARD IS DEPEN 247948 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY DENT UPON THE VOLUME PUT INTO CIRCU LATION CURRENCY ISSUES ARE USUALLY UNDER THE CONTROL OF SOME AUTHORITY AND REGULATED TO SUPPLY A CIRCULATING MEDIUM WHICH WILL ITSELF SUSTAIN A FIXED RELATION TO THE STANDARD OF VALUE AND THEREFORE A NORMALLY STABLE LEVEL OF PRICES BUT WHERE NOT REGULATED ACCORDING TO THIS POLICY BUT SIMPLY PAID OUT UPON GOVERNMENTAL EXPENDI TURES THE PURCHASING POWER INEVITABLY DECLINES EVERY ADDITIONAL ISSUE DI LUTES AND DIMINISHES THE VALUE OF ALL THAT IS OUTSTANDING ONCE ISSUED IT STAYS OUT UNTIL IT IS REDEEMED NOT NECESSARILY IN GOLD BUT BY CANCELLATION WHICH INVOLVES A CONTRACTION OF CREDIT IF THE NOTES ARE ISSUED BY A CENTRAL BANK IT IS IN THE PROCESS OF GRANTING CREDIT AND THE NOTES MAY BE RETIRED IN PAYMENT OF THE CREDIT BUT THIS MEANS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REDUCE INFLATION IS BY PRODUCING AND SAVING WEALTH AND APPLYING IT TO THE CANCELLA TION OF CREDIT THE ECONOMIC OFFENSE IN PRINTING MONEY TO CARRY ON THE EXPENSES OF A GOVERNMENT IS IN ATTEMPTING TO GET SOMETHING FOR NOTHING THAT CANNOT BE DONE IN ANY ECONOMIC SENSE THERE IS ALWAYS A SETTLEMENT SOMEWHERE BY SOMEBODY THE PEOPLE MUST PAY IN SOME MANNER FOR WHATEVER THEIR GOVERN MENT EXPENDS IF IT PRINTS MONEY TO MEET ITS PAYMENTS THEY SUFFER IN THE CORRESPONDING DEPRECIATION OF ALL THE OUTSTANDING PAPER ISSUES IF IT CREATES AND USES PURCHASING POWER IN ANY OTHER FORM OF CREDIT THE EFFECT UPON PRICES IS THE SAME THIS EFFECT UPON PRICES OR IN OTHER WORDS THE RESULTING DEPRECIATION OF THE PURCHASING POWER OF CREDIT FOLLOWS FROM AN ATTEMPT TO USE A LARGE AMOUNT OF PURCHASING POWER WITHOUT ANY CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THE SUPPLY OF THINGS TO BE PURCHASED THE EFFECT OF INFLATION UPON PRICES IS NOT A MYSTE RIOUS OR OCCULT PHENOMENON PECULIAR TO CURRENCY BUT SIMPLY A PHASE OF THE FAMILIAR OPERATIONS OF THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IN SO FAR AS AN INCREASED SUPPLY OF CURRENCY IS CALLED FOR BY A MORE GENERAL STATE OF INDUSTRIAL ACTIVITY AND A MORE COMPLETE INDUSTRIAL EM PLOYMENT OF THE POPULATION EXPAN SION IS THE PROPER TERM TO DESCRIBE IT INFLATION BEGINS WHEN THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT IN USE IS NOT REQUIRED AND OFFSET BY GREATER PRODUCTION AND A CORRES PONDING INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF COMMODITIES TO BE HANDLED THE WAR AND PRICE INFLATION WAGES AND PRICES THE ORIGINAL CAUSE OF THE RECENT RISE OF PRICES UNDOUBTEDLY WAS THE WAR IT CREATED A PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED DE MAND FOR MANPOWER EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES THE FIRST EFFECT WAS TO TAKE UP WHATEVER SLACK THERE WAS IN THE INDUSTRIES AND IF THE DEMAND HAD GONE NO FURTHER THE EFFECT UPON WAGES AND PRICES WOULD HAVE BEEN BUT SLIGHT BUT IT COULD NOT BE STOPPED AT THIS PRECISE POINT IT SOON ASSUMED THE FORM OF A COMPETITIVE STRUGGLE FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS THE GOVERNMENT LET THE CONTRACTS FOR ITS CANTONMENTS WHICH WERE LOCATED IN ALL PARTS OF THE COUNTRY ON A COSTPLUS BASIS AND THE CONTRACTORS PROCEEDED TO OFFER WAGES WHICH WOULD ATTRACT LABOR FROM OTHER EMPLOYMENTS THEN CAME THE CON TRACTS FOR MUNITION WORKS GUN WORKS AEROPLANE FACTORIES SHIPYARDS AND EQUIPMENT OF ALL KINDS AND THE DEMAND FOR LABOR IN THE ORDIFIARY INDUSTRIES DID NOT FALL OFF THE ENOR MOUS EXPENDITURES OF THE GOVERNMENTTHE CAUSE AND PROCESS OF INFLATION 49 POURED MORE MONEY INTO THE REGULAR CHANNELS OF TRADE THE DEMAND FOR GOODS FOR PRIVATE CONSUMPTION INCREASED AND THE MAKERS OF SUCH GOODS STRUGGLED VIGOROUSLY TO HOLD THEIR EMPLOYES AGAINST ALL COMPETITORS INCLUDING THE WAR INDUSTRIES IN SHORT THERE WAS A PRACTICALLY UNLIMITED COMPETITIVE DE MAND PLAYING UPON A STRICTLY LIMITED SUPPLY OF LABOR AND MATERIALS AND A GREAT RISE OF WAGES AND PRICES WAS THE NATURAL RESULT THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE CONTENTION THAT THE INFLATION OF CREDIT FOLLOWED AND RESULTED FROM THE RISE OF PRICES AND DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO IT BUT THE CONTENTION GOES TOO FAR THOSE WHO HOLD THAT AN INCREASED SUPPLY OF CREDIT WILL PROMOTE HIGHER PRICES ARE FREE TO ADMIT THAT IT IS THE USE OF THE INCREASED SUPPLY AND NOT THE MERE FACT THAT THE SUPPLY IS AVAILABLE WHICH MAKES PRICES RISE BUT THEY POINT OUT THAT IF THE INCREASED SUPPLY OF CREDIT WAS NOT AVAILABLE IT COULD NOT BE USED AND THAT UNDER THE WARTIME CONDITIONS IF FREELY AVAILABLE IT WAS CERTAIN TO BE USED AND CERTAIN TO FORCE UP WAGES AND PRICES THE HEEDLESS ATTEMPT TO DRIVE THE INDUSTRIAL MACHINE BEYOND ITS PHYSICAL CAPAC ITY CAUSED THE INFLATION BECAUSE OF ENORMOUS PRESSURE FOR GOODS WE TURNED INTO THE CHANNELS OF INDUSTRY AND TRADE TWICE AS MANY DOLLARS AS HAD BEEN IN USE BEFORE EACH REPRESENTING NOMINALLY THE OLD PURCHASING POWER BANK CREDIT EXPANSION AND PRODUCTION THE AVAILABLE INFORMATION INDICATES THAT PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY IN CREASED BUT SLIGHTLY AFTER THE UNITED STATES ENTERED THE WAR IT INCREASED IN SOME LINES BY DRAWING LABOR FROM OTHERS BUT NOT MUCH ON THE WHOLE THERE WAS A GREAT EXPANSION OF BANK CREDIT HOWEVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINANCING THE COMPETITIVE STRUGGLE OVER THE LIMITED SUPPLY OF LABOR AND MATE RIALS THIS EXPANSION FURNISHED COM PETITORS WITH THE MEANS TO BID AGAINST EACH OTHER AND THUS CONTRIBUTED DIRECTLY TO THE RISE OF PRICES WHILE CONTRIBUTING VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL TO PRODUCTION WE HAD A GRAND SCRAMBLE FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS INSTEAD OF AN ORGANIZED SCHEME OF UTILIZING OUR INDUSTRIAL FORCES IF A SINGLE FAMILY LIVING IN A POSITION OF PARTIAL ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE AS ON A FARM SHOULD SUDDENLY FACE REVERSES OR THE NECESSITY OF MAKING HEAVY NON PRODUCTIVE EXPENDITURES IT WOULD KNOW IMMEDIATELY WHAT IT WOULD HAVE TO DO IT WOULD HAVE TO WORK HARDER PRODUCE MORE LIVE MORE ECONOMICALLY AND HAVE A LARGER SURPLUS WITH WHICH TO MEET THE NEW DEMANDS UPON IT THE ECONOMIC LAW IS THE SAME FOR A NATION AS FOR A FAMILY BUT THERE IS NOT THE SAME READY APPREHENSION OF THE FACTS OUR PEO PLE DID NOT UNDERSTAND THAT THE OUT LAYS UPON THE WAR MUST BE MET BY INCREASED PRODUCTION AND GREATER ECON OMY THEY THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD GO TO THE BANKS AND BORROW FOR THE GOVERNMENT LOANS AND EVEN TO PAY THEIR TAXES AND BUT FOR A FEW GASLESS SUNDAYS AND SOME ECONOMY IN THE USE OF SUGAR FLOUR AND A FEW OTHER COMMODITIES WHICH WE WERE REQUIRED TO SHARE WITH OUR ALLIES THEY EXPECTED TO GO ON ABOUT AS USUAL INDEED IN BUSINESS CIRCLES IT WAS ARGUED THAT BUSINESS MUST GO ON AS USUAL IN ORDER THAT THE WAR TAXES MIGHT BE PAID THIS IS NOT WRITTEN IN CRITICISM WE WERE NO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER PEOPLES IN THIS RESPECT THERE IS NO SUCH POPU LAR KNOWLEDGE OF ECONOMIC LAW AS WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SUDDENLY REORGANQ50 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IZE A NATION TO MEET THE EMERGENCY OF WAR WITHOUT INFLATION THAT WOULD MEAN THE MOST RESOLUTE AND ABSTEMIOUS VOLUNTARY SELFDENIAL ON THE PART OF EVERY PERSON IN ORDER THAT THE INDUS TRIAL RESOURCES OF THE COUNTRY MIGHT BE TURNED OVER TO GOVERNMENTAL USES OR THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE AN ARBITRARY SEIZURE OF THE INDUSTRIES AND COMMAN DEERING OF THE POPULATION INASMUCH AS THE PUBLIC WOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE REASONS FOR SUCH A COURSE IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT IT COULD NOT BE FOLLOWED WITHOUT AN AMOUNT OF CONTENTION AND DISSATISFACTION THAT WOULD HAVE SERI OUSLY INTERFERED WITH ITS EFFECTIVENESS AND PERHAPS LESSENED THE POWER OF THE COUNTRY IN THE WAR IN OTHER WORDS THE CONDUCT OF A WAR WITHOUT MORE OR LESS INFLATION IS IMPOSSIBLE BORROWING AS A CAUSE OF INFLATION THIS ADMISSION HOWEVER IS OUTSIDE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT THE FREE USE OF BANK CREDIT WITH THE FAILURE TO COAIRDI NATE AND CONTROL INDUSTRY AND THE WHOLESALE PROMOTION OF COMPETITION OVER LABOR AND MATERIALS CONTRIBUTED LARGELY TO THE RISE OF WAGES AND PRICES AND THE COST OF THE WAR THIS CONTEN TION IS NOT ANSWERED BY SIMPLY SAYING THAT THE RISE OF WAGES AND PRICES RE QUIRED THE USE OF MORE CREDIT IT IS NECESSARY TO GO BACK OF THE RISE OF WAGES AND PRICES AND TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE FACT THAT WHILE EVERY EMPLOYER WAS INTERESTED IN INCREASING HIS OWN OUTPUT HE COULD ONLY INCREASE HIS WORKING FORCE BY HIRING LABOR AWAY FROM HIS COMPETITORS AND THAT THE LABOR TURNOVER HAD REACHED PROPOR TIONS NEVER BEFORE APPROACHED IN THE LAST ANALYSIS THIS WAS THE SITUATION LARGELY RESPONSIBLE FOR RISING PRICES AND THE DEMAND FOR MORE CREDIT THIS BOR ROWING FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENLARGING THE OUTPUT OF AN INDIVIDUAL PLANT BUT WHICH DID NOT INCREASE THE TOTAL PRODUCTION WAS PURE INFLATION NOW THAT WE HAVE THIS INFLATED STATE OF CREDIT HOW ARE WE TO GET RID OF IT UPON THE THEORY OF THOSE PEOPLE WHO HOLD THAT A SUPPLY OF CURRENCY OR BANK CREDIT IS ANALOGOUS TO A SUPPLY OF RAILWAY CARS AN INCREASED SUPPLY OF CURRENCY HAVING NO GREATER INFLUENCE IN CREATING BUSINESS THAN THE LATTER ALL OF THIS INFLATION WILL DISAPPEAR AS SOON AS CONDITIONS IN PRODUCTION WORK BACK TO NORMAL OR WHEN A PERIOD OF DEPRES SION COMES BUT THE ANALOGY IS UN SOUND THERE IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IDLE MONEY OR BANK CREDIT AND IDLE RAILWAY CARS THE LATTER ARE INSTRU MENTS OF CARRIAGE PURE AND SIMPLE BUT IDLE CAPITAL OR CREDIT CAN BE MADE EFFECTIVE IN CREATING BUSINESS THEY CAN BE USED IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SHIFTED TO DIFFERENT FIELDS THEIR OWN ERS ARE NEVER CONTENT TO HAVE THEM IDLE FOR LONG THIS GREAT BODY OF OUTSTANDING BANK CREDIT CAN ONLY BE RETIRED AS IT IS CAN CELLED BY EARNINGS AND SAVINGS AND BY LIQUIDATION OF THE STOCKS OF COMMODITIES HELD AGAINST IT A FALL OF PRICES WOULD REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT NECESSARY TO CARRY NEW STOCKS IN THE FUTURE AND MAKE CASH RESOURCES GO FARTHER BUT IT WOULD INVOLVE LOSSES UPON EXISTING STOCKS PAYMENT AND ELIMINATIONIT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE PEOPLE SEE THAT THE EXISTING GREAT VOLUME OF BANK DEPOSITS MUST BE REDUCED IN PRECISELY THE SAME MANNER AS AN OVERISSUE OF PAPER CUR RENCY WOULD BE REDUCED NAMELY BY PAYMENT AND ELIMINATION THE DE POSITS WERE CREATED BY THE LOANS AND SHOULD BE USED IN PART TO PAY THE LOANSTHE CAUSE AND PROCESS OF INFLATION 251 THAT WOULD BRING BANKING CONDITIONS BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE WHEN THE INFLATION BEGAN WHEN A MAN BORROWS 10000 AT A BANK AND TAKES CREDIT FOR IT IN HIS ACCOUNT THE DEPOSITS AS WELL AS LOANS OF THAT BANK GO UP 10000 AND WHEN HE CHECKS IT OUT THE DEPOSITS OF OTHER BANKS WILL GO UP CORRESPOND INGLY AND THAT 10000 OF CREDIT WILL STAY IN CIRCULATION PRECISELY AS THOUGH IT WERE PAPER MONEY UNTIL 10000 OF REAL SAVINGSCAPITALIS DEVOTED TO ITS ELIMINATION THIS MAKES DEFLATION SLOW BUSINESS THE PEOPLE HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO USING MORE CREDIT THE NEW BANK ING SYSTEM WHICH MAKES FOR A MORE ECONOMICAL USE OF RESERVES FAVORS A LARGER USE OF CREDIT THAN UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM AND THE PROFITS OF BANKERS WILL BE ENHANCED BY HAVING THEIR FUNDS FULLY EMPLOYED IN ORDER TO SECURE DEFLA TION THE BANKS SHOULD TAKE UP THE SLACK AS FAST AS THE DEMAND FOR CREDIT RELAXES AND NOT LET IT OUT AGAIN BUT BANKING IN THE UNITED STATES IS ON A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE BASIS AND THE PROBABILITY IS THAT WHEN MONEY BE COMES EASY THE BANKERS WILL REDUCE INTEREST RATES AND COMPETE SHARPLY TO GET THEIR FUNDS INTO USE THE PROCESS OF DEFLATION IS COMPLI CATED ALSO BECAUSE WE ARE INVOLVED IN A WORLD SITUATION AND SUBJECT TO THE PLAY OF WORLD INFLUENCES UPON PRICES CREDITS AND GOLD RESERVES IN THE PAST WE NEVER LOST GOLD IN LARGE AMOUNTS EXCEPT TO EUROPE AND WE HAD A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER THAT MOVEMENT BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THE EUROPEAN MARKET WOULD ALWAYS TAKE OUR SECURITIES AT A PRICE NOW WE HAVE A FAIR DEGREE OF CONTROL OVER DIRECT EUROPEAN DEMANDS BY REASON OF EUROPES INDEBTEDNESS TO US BUT NEW DEMANDS FOR GOLD HAVE DEVELOPED FROM SOUTH AMERICA AND ASIA EUROPE OWES US AND WE OWE SOUTH AMERICA AND ASIA BUT WE CANNOT USE OUR CREDITS IN EUROPE TO SETTLE WITH OUR CREDITORS THE LATTER ARE DRAWING ON US HEAVILY AND LOWERING OUR BANK RESERVES OUR REMEDY IS TO LOWER OUR PRICES AND SELL MORE GOODS IN ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA NOMINALLY THE UNITED STATES IS ON THE GOLD BASIS BUT THAT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF THE GREAT STORE OF GOLD ACCUMULATED IN THE PAST WHILE IT LASTS WE WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN GOLD PAYMENTS THAT WAGES AND PRICES IN THIS COUNTRY ARE NOT ON A GOLD BASIS IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT GOLD PRODUCTION IS RAPIDLY DECLINING ONLY WELL DEVELOPED MINES WHICH HAVE AFFORDED AN UNUSUAL MARGIN OF PROFIT IN THE PAST CAN CONTINUE TO OPERATE AT PRESENT COSTS THE COAL COPPER SILVER AND LEAD OPERATORS CAN AFFORD TO PAY PRESENT MINING COSTS BECAUSE THE MARKET PRICES OF THEIR PRODUCTS HAVE RISEN BUT THE PRICE OF GOLD REMAINS 2322 GRAINS TO THE DOLLAR AS BEFORE THE WAR THE PRO DUCTION OF GOLD IN THE UNITED STATES HAS FALLEN BELOW OUR CONSUMPTION IN THE ARTS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DECLINE UNTIL WAGES AND PRICES RETURN TO THE GOLD BASIS EFFECTS OF CREDIT RESTRICTION ON WAGES AND PRICES WITH THE BANKING SYSTEM EXPANDED TO THE LIMIT OF RESERVES AND WITH RESERVES DECLINING THE OUTLOOK IS FOR A CONTINUED CONSTRICTION OF CREDIT IT MUST BE CONSIDERED THAT IN A GROWING COUNTRY LIKE THE UNITED STATES WHERE THE VOLUME OF PRODUCTION AND TRADE IS CONSTANTLY INCREASING THE VOLUME OF CREDIT IS NORMALLY INCREASING IF THE952 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COUNTRY IS TO DO BUSINESS ON THE GOLD STANDARD WAGES AND PRICES MUST BE IN TERMS OF THE GOLD STANDARD IN OTHER WORDS THEY MUST COME DOWN AND IF THE VOLUME OF CREDIT IS RESTRICTED THEY WILL BE EVENTUALLY BROUGHT DOWN BUT WHAT WILL THE PUBLIC HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS CREDIT RESTRICTION AND THE EFFECT UPON WAGES AND PRICES THAT IS THE NEXT IMPORTANT QUESTION EVERY PERIOD OF FALLING PRICES AND BUSINESS DEPRESSION IN THE HISTORY OF THIS COUNTRY HAS BROUGHT ON AN ATTACK UPON THE BANKING AND MONETARY SYS TEMS NO OTHER PUBLIC QUESTION OR QUESTION OF GOVERNMENTAL POLICY IS SO ADAPTED TO SERVE THE PURPOSES OF POLITI CAL AND SOCIAL AGITATORS AND REVOLU TIONARIES AS THE MONEY QUESTION WILL THE OLD AND INSIDIOUS GREENBACK AND FREE SILVER ARGUMENTS BE REVIVED AND THE ATTACK ON THE EXISTING GOLD STANDARD BE RENEWED WILL THE 24000000000 OF FRESH GOVERNMENT INDEBTEDNESSTHE LIBERTY BONDS RECENTLY PROCLAIMED AS THE BEST SECURITY IN THE WORLDBE PAID BY COMMON CONSENT IN GOLD OF THE EXISTING STANDARD AS THEY COME DUE OR WILL THERE BE A STRUGGLE TO CHANGE THE STANDARD

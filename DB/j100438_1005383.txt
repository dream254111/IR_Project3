PENINSYLVANIA AND OTHER REGIONS VI A METHOD FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANIALYSIS OF NATURAL GAS VII ORIGINI OF NATURAL GAS ANID PETROLEUM INTRODUCTION THE PURPOSE OF THE FOLLOWING RESEARCH AS ORIGINALLY BEGUN WAS TO STUDY EX HAUSTIVELY THE COMPOSITION OF NATURAL GAS AS FOUNID IN WESTERNI PENNSYLVANIA DUR ING A SERIES OF ANALYSES BY BUNSENS METHODS USING EUDIOMETERS CALIBRATED WITH GREAT CARE AND MAKING READINGS BY MEANS OF A GRUNOT CATHETOMETER OF SUPERIOR CONSTRUCTION MANY DIFFICULTIES WERE ENCOUNLTERED WHICH WERE NOT EASILY OVERCOME MORE EXACT METHODS FOR THE POSITIVE IDENTIFICATION OF THE VARIOUS CONSTITUENTS OF A GAS MIXTURE SEEMED NECESSARY AND FINAALLY A STUDY OF THE QUALITATIVE REACTIONS OF GASES WAS UNDERTAKEN SINCE THE PUBLICATION OF BTUNSENS GASOMETRISCHE METHODEN A P SVOL XVII T150 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES THE INTRODUCTION OF THE VARIOUS FORMS OF APPARATUS PROPOSED BY IEMPEL AND WINKLER HAS TENDED TO GREATLY SIMPLIFY QUANTITATIVE GAS ANALYSIS THE MAJORITY OF ABSORPTIONI GASOMETRIC METHODS ARE BASED UPON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE CONTRACTION UNDERGONE BY THE VOLUME OF A GAS ON EXPOSURE TO A LIQUID REAGENT IS NOT ONILY A MEASURE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF A PARTICULAR CONSTITUENT OF THE GAS MIX TURE BUT THAT THE IDENTITY OF SUCH CONSTITUENT IS ESTABLISHED BY THIE SAME OPERATION THIS ASSUMPTION IS VERY OFTEN WARRANTED BY THE FACTS BUT OCCASIONALLY LEADS TO ERROR QUALITATIVE METHODS FOR THE RECOGNITION OF DIFFERENT GASES HAVE USUALLY BEEN HELD WHOLLY SUBORDINATE TO QUALNTITATIVE ABSORPTION OR EXPLOSIOLL METHODS QLUANTITATIVE ANALYSES ARE FAR MORE RELIABLE IF THE CONSTITUENTS TO BE DETERMINED CAN BE POSITIVELY IDENTIFIED BY INDEPENDENT METHODS AND IT IS SOMEWHAT STRANGE THAT HERETOFORE THE QUALITATIVE SIDE OF GAS ANALYSIS SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED SO SMALL A SHARE OF ATTENTION IN THE FOLLOWING WORK AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO COLLECT TOGFETHER THE MORE IMPOR TANT REACTIONS OF THE COMMONLY OCCURRING GASES THE RESULTS MUST BE REGARDED AS A FIRST ATTEMPT ONLY INASMUCH AS IMPROVED METHODS OF PREPARATION ANID PURIFICATION WILL DOUBTLESS INVOLVE THE NECESSITY OF CORRECTIONS IN CERTAIN CASES ACCURATE METHODS OF QUALITATIVE GAS ANALYSIS ARE LIKELY TO PROVE OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE IN THE STUDY OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE LABORATORY AND IN THE CHEMICAL ARTS THE FOLLOWING SUB DIVISION OF THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN FOTUND CONVENIENT 1 PHENOMENA OF

PREVENT GLOWING CAUTION IS NECESSARY SHOULD A MIXTURE OF OXYGEN AND HYDROGEN BE EXPOSED TO PALLADIUM IN EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH TUBES OF ONEMILLIMETER BORE AND AT A TEMPERATURE OF 1000 IT WAS FOUND THAT THE HYDROGENI IN BURNING CAUSES A SERIES OF SHARP EXPLOSIONS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE QUIET AND SLOW OXIDATION WHICH INVARIABLY CHARACTERIZES THE MIXTURE OF AIR AND HYDROGEN EXPT 2TO DETERMINE THE

GASES 225 VII ORIGIN OF NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM SOON AFTER THE EARLY DISCOVERIES OF OIL AND GAS IN PENNSYLVANIA THE GEOLOGISTS PROPOSED A HYPOTHESIS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE OR IGIN OF THESE REMARKABLE SUBSTANCES REMAINS OF THE MARINE VEGETATION OF THE DEVONIAN INLANID SEA AS THEY WERE GRAD UALLY BURIED UNDER THE LATER ACCUMULATIONS OF SEDIMENT AND EXPOSED TO GENTLE HEAT FROM BELOW UNDERWENT A SLOW PROCESS OF DESTRUCTIVE DISTILLATION IN THIS WAY ALL THE VARIETIES OF PETROLEUM AND NATURAL GAS WERE PRODUCED THIS VIEW ADOPTED FROM A PURELY GEOLOGICAL STANDPOINT SEEMED SO PLAUSIBLE THAT FOR A LONIG PERIOD NO OTHER WAS THOUGHT OF MR J F CARL OF THE SECOND GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF PENNSYLVANIA HAS DISCUSSED THE HYPOTHESIS VERY EXHAUSTIVELY IN HIS VARIOUS OFFICIAL REPORTS IF THIS VIEW IS CORRECT OIL AND GAS ARE PROBABLY STORED PRODUTCTS AND ARE NOT BEING CON TINUOUSLY GENERATED AT THE PRESENT TIME OPPOSED TO THIS VIEW IS THE MORE STRICTLY CHEMICAL HYPOTHESIS OF MENDELEEFF WHO IN 1876 EXPRESSED HIS BELIEF THAT PETROLEUM AND GAS ARE OF IGNEOUS ORIGIN ON ACCOUNT OF THE HIGH VALUE ASSIGNED BY ASTRONOMERS FOR THE MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE SUIFACE ROCKS IT FOLLOWS THAT THE HEAVY METALS ARE MNAINLY ACCUMULATED AT GREAT DEPTHS WHERE A TEMPERATURE OF FUSION MAY BE AS SUMED MANY OF THESE METALS COMBINE READILY WITH CARBON TO FORM CARBIDES IRON IN FORM OF A CARBIDE WLHEN EXPOSED TO STEAM AT HIGH TEMPERATURES IS RAPIDLY OXIDIZED THE HYDROGEN OF THE WATER THEN COMBINING WITH THE CARBON SET FREE AND PRODUCING HYDROCARBONS CITINIG EXPERIMENTS OF CLOEZ WHO PRODUCED MIXTURES OF HYDROCARBON OILS BY THE ACTION OF HYDROCHLOR IC ACID UPON FERROMANGANESE MENDELEEFF CONCLUDED THAT SUCH REACTIONS HAVE OCCURRED AT GREAT DEPTHS BELOW THE EARTHS SURFACE BY THE CONTACT OF STEAM WITH INCANDESCENT METALLIC CARBIDES DURING THE UPHEAVAL OF MOUNTAIN RANGES CREVICES WOULD BE FORMED AT THE PEAKS WITH OPENINGS UTPWARD AND AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS WITH OPENINGS DOWN WARD THUS THERE WAS OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WATER TO PENETRATE TO GREAT DEPTHS AND FOR THE HYDROCARBONS TO ESCAPE THE SITUATION OF NAPHTHA AT THE FOOT OF MOUNITAIN CHAINS IS THE CHIEF ARGUMENT IN MY HYPOTHESIS MENDELEEFF PRINCIPLES OF CHEMISTRY FOL I P 365 ACCORDING TO THIS VIEW OIL AND GAS ARE BEING CONTTNUOUSLY GENERATED FOR THERE IS NO REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MASSES OF METALLIC CARBIDES IN THE EARTHS INITERIOR ARE EXHAUSTED SUCH IN FACT SEEMS TO BE MENDEL6EFFS VIEW226 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES MENDELE6EFF POINTS ESPECIALLY TO THE ABSENCE OF LARGE QUANTITIES OF NITROGEN COM POUNDS IN PETROLEUM AS AN ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF THE HYPOTHESIS THE OBJECTION HAS BEENI URGED AGAINST THIS HYPOTHESIS THAT PETROLEUM IF THUS PRODUCED SHOULD BE ABUNDANIT IN THE PRIMARY ROCKS FROM WHICH IT IS USUALLY ABSENT THE ORIGINALLY HEATED CONDITIONI OF THESE ROCKS WOULD HAVE PREVELNTED THE CONDENSA TION OF OIL HOWEVER AND ALTHOUGH THE VAPORS MAY HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE EARLIER ROCKS THERE IS NLO REASON TO EXPECT THAT CONDENSATION SLHOULD HAVE OCCURRED BEFORE REACHING MUCH HIGHER STRATA WHILE ON GEOLOGICAL GROUNDS DIFFICULT TO PROVE OR DISPROVE IT MEETS WITH ONE FATAL OBJECTION THE COMPOSITION OF NATURAL GAS IN PENINSYLVANIA DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE SUP POSITION THAT SUPERHEATED STEAM AND CARBON HAVE BEEN CONCERNED IN ITS FORMATION WE SLHOULD CERTAINLY LOOK IN SUCH A CASE TO FIND NATURAL GAS COMPOSED MAINLY OF FIEE HYDROGEN CONTAINING SMALL QUANTITIES OF PARAFFINS OLEFINES AND CARBON MONOXIDE WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT PARAFFINS ALONE CANNOT UNDER ANLY KNOWN CIRCUMSTANCES BE PRODUCED FROM THE OXIDATION OF CARBIDE OF IRON BY STEAM THE HYPOTHESIS DOES NOT SEEM TO BE TENABLE IT IS TRUE THIAT VARYING CONDITIONS OF TEMPERATURE MIGHT HAVE PRODUCED A GREAT VARIETY OF HYDROCARBONS BUT NO EVIDENCE HAS YET BEEN OBTAINED THAT PARAFFINS ALONE RESULT FIOM SUCH A REACTION IN AN EXPERIMENT MADE WITH FERROMANGANESE AND DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID THE GAS EVOLVED WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN 6 PER CENT OF OLEFINES IT IS FURTHER TO BE NOTICED THAT THIS HYPOTHESIS REQUIRES THAT WATER SHOULD TAKE PART IN THE PROCESS YIELDING UP ITS HYDROGEN WHILE ACCORDING TO THE OLDER GEOLOGICAL HYPOTHESIS THE WATER MAY HAVE SERVED MAINLV TO COVER AND GIVE PROTECTION FROM ATMOSPHERIC OXIDATION IF IT HAS BEEN CONCERNED AT ALL IN THE REACTION WATER CONTAINS DISSOLVED OXYGEN AND IN DESCENDING TO THE IRON CARBIDES MUST HAVE GIVEN OFF ITS DISSOLVED OXYGEN LONG BEFORE REACHING THE REGION AT WHICH ACTUAL FORMATION OF HYDROCARBONS COULD OCEUR HENCE ON THIS HYPOTLHESIS OXYGEN SHOULD BE FOUND IN NATURAL GAS IN LARGER QUANTITY THAN THE CHEMICAL TESTS INDICATE IN FACT IN ROCKS OF MODERATELY HIGH CONDUCTING POWER A WIDE INTERVAL WOULD EXIST BETWEEN THE DEPTH AT WHICH WATER BOILS AND THE MUCH GREATER DEPTH AT WHICH WATER VAPOR COULD OXIDIZE METALLIC IRON IN QUANTITY IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER WATER COULD HAVE TRAVERSED THIS INTERVAL SO AS TO REACH THE LATTER DEPTH AT ALL ENGLER BER VOL XXI P 1816 AND VOL XXII P 592 HAS PUBLISHED THE RESULTS OF INTERESTING INVESTIGATIONS UPON THE DISTILLATION PRODTUCTS OF MENHADEN FISH OIL BY CONDUCTING THE DISTILLATION AT A HIGH PRESSURE 25 ATMOSPHERES THIS AUTHOR PRODUCED A MIXTURE OF HYDROCARBON OILS FROM WHICH A LARGE NUMBER OF NORMAL  EXPERIMENTS BY F C PRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 227 PARAFFINS WAS OBTAINED COMPOUNDS NOT FOUND ELSEWHERE IN NATURE THAN IN PE TROLEUM THIS HAS LED TO THE REVIVAL OF AN OLDER THEORY AS TO THE ORIGIN OF PETROLEUM AND GAS I E THAT THEY HAVE RESULTED FROM THE DISTILLATION UNDER PRESSURE AND AT LOW TEM PERATURES OF THE ACCUMULATED REMAINS OF MARINE LIFE BURIED UNDER THE SEDIMENTS OF THE ANCIENT DEVONIAN SEAS MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN SUPPORT OF THE HYPOTHESIS OF ENGLER AND IT MAY BE SAID TO HAVE GAINED VERY GENERAL ACCEPTANCE IN EUROPE OCHSEINIUS CHEM ZEITUNG 1891 P 936 HAS SUMMARIZED MANY OF THE ARGU MENITS USUALLY ADDUICED IN SUPPORT OF THE HYPOTHESIS THIS AUTHOR SAYS  CONCERNING THE ORIGIN OF PETROLEUM THERE IS NOW NO DOUBT THAT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS ANIMAL REMAINS MAINLY OF MARINE LIFE HAVE YIELDED THE RAW MATERIAL ORIGINALLY THE OPINIION WAS HELD THIAT IT WAS DERIVED FROM VEGETABLE MATTERS BE CAUSE THE ACCUMULATION OF ANIMAL REMAINS SUFFICIENT TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS FORMATION BY ANY DISTILLATION PROCESS IN THE ROCKS COULD NOT BE EXPLAINED DISTILLATION OF VEGE TABLE MATTERS WOULD HOWEVER HAVE LEFT GREATER DEPOSITS OF COAL AS A RESIDUE IN THE DEVOINIAN ROCKS BUT PETROLEUM OCCURS IN ROCKS OF MARINE FORMATION WHERE COAL IS UNCOMMON ROCKS IN WHICH PLANT REMAINIS ARE FOUND DO NLOT CONITAIN BITUMENI PETRO LEUM IF ANIMAL REMAINS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE OF PLANTS THEN BITUMEN IS USU ALLY FOUND THE OBJECTION URGED AGAINST THE HPOTHESIS OF ENGLER THAT NITROGEN DOES NOT OCCUR IN PETROLEUM IS EASILY OVERCOME BY THE FACT THAT NITROGENI OF ANIMAL TISSUES TENDS FINALLY TO PRODUCE AMMONIA AND THIS IN THE CASE OF PETROLEUM MAY HAVE BEEN CARRIED AWAY IN SOLUTION BY WATER HENCE THE ABSENCE OF NITROGENI COMPOUNDS FROM ENGLERS EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARS THAT ANIMAL FATS ARE THE CHIEF SOURCE OF PETROLEUM IT IS TRUE THAT FATTY MATTERS DO NOT ORDINARILY SINK IN WATER ALTHOUGH VON GUEMBEL IN THE VOYAGE OF THE GAZELLE FOUND FAT GLOBULES IN DREDGINGS FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN WATER 15000 FEET DEEP PUTREFACTIVE CHANGES WOULD TEND TO YIELD CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES OF AMMONIA AND CARBON DIOXIDE THESE IN PRESENCE OF SALT WATER WOULD PRODUCE ALKALI BICARBONI ATE AND AMMONIUM CHLORIDE HENCE ALKALINE WATERS MIGHT BE LOOKED FOR IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF PETROLEUM THE PETROLEUM AT PCCHELBROIIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH WATER CONTAINING 05 PER CENT OF ALKALINE CARBONATE IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA MANY CASES ARE KNOWN OF WATER HAVING A DECIDED ALKALINE REACTION IN THE

DEVELOPMENT NOTE BY F C P SUCH ALKALINE WATERS ARE NOT KNOWN IN ARCHAEAN ROCKS AND ARE NOT THEREFORE LIKELY TO BE DERIVED FROM GREATER DEPTHS THANI THE ROCKS IN WHICH THEY ARE FOUND PROBABLY NO CASES CAN BE CITED WHERE FATTY TISSUES ALONIE OF BURIED ANIMALS HAVE YIELDED OIL OR GAS THE PRESENICE OF STRONGLY SALINE WATER IS APPARENTLY NEEDED GREAT DIFFIERENCES OCCUR IN THE CBEMICAL CLHARACTER OF PETROLEUM CAUCASIAN OILS ARE MAINLY COMPOSED OF OLEFINES OR SUBSTANCES RELATED TO THE OLEFINE GROUP THE GERMAN OILS ARE MIXTURES OF PARAFFINS AND OLEFINES WHILE THE AMERICAN ARE CHIEFLY PARAFFLINS SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE CHARACTER OF THE ROCK IN WHICH THE DISTILLATION HAS OCCURRED SANDSTONES WOTULD PROBABLY PROVE WITHOUT ACTION WHILE LIMESTONES BY REASON OF THEIR BASIC CHARACTER WOULD TEND TO STRONGLY INFLUENCE THE PRODUCTS SUCH ARE SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS OF OCHSENIUS IN FAVOR OF ENGLERS HYPOTHESIS IF THIS VIEW IS ACCEPTED IT FOLLOWS THAT THE GENERATION OF PETROLEUM AND GAS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS A FINISHED PROCESS SO FAR AS ALL EXISTINIG PRODUCTIVE GAS AND OIL REGIONS ARE CONICERNED ENGLER HAS ANALYZED THE GAS EVOLVED WHEN 1 MENHADEN OIL AND 2 WHEN OLEIC ACID ARE

NIORMAL PARAFLINS AND THEIR ISOMERS 100 PARTS OF MENHADEN OIL YIELDED 89 PARTS OF GAS AND 63 PARTS OF LIQUID OILS A STRONG ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE ENGLER HYPOTHESIS IS FOUND IN THE FACT THAT BY DISTILLATION OF FISH OILS BESIDES METHANE SEVERAL OF THE LOWER PARAFFINS ARE PRO DUCED IN LARGE QUANTITY HYDROCARBONIS OF THE PARAFFIN SERIES ARE NOT OBTAINABLE IN SUCH PROPORTIONS BY THE DISTILLATION AT HIGH TEMPERATURES OF OTHER ORGANIC MATERIAL UNDER ORDINARY CONDITIONS IT SHOULD BE NOTED AS A FACT OF MUCH INTEREST AS REGARDS THE RESULTS OF ENGLERS RESEARCHES THAT IN THE DISTILLATION AT HIGHER PRESSURES THE PROPORTION OF OLEFINES CON TAINED IN THE GASES EVOLVED IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF CARBON MONIOX IDE WHEN OLEIC ACID WAS DISTILLED IT IS TO BE REGRETTED THAT ENGLERS EXPERIMENTSRESEARCHES UPON THE CHIEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 229 WERE NOT REPEATED AT STILL HIGHER PRESSURES IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THESE SAME CONSTITUENTS OF THE EVOLVED GASES DIMINISH PROGRESSIVELY WITH INCREASED PRESSURE ENGLER WAS THE FIRST TO SHOW CLEARLY THAT THE PROBLEM OF THE ORIGIN OF OIL AND GAS MUST BE STUDIED FROM THE CHEMICAL RATHER THAN THE GEOLOGICAL STANDPOINT THE HYPOTHESIS ADVANCED BY THIS AUTHOR HAS BEEN VERY GENERALLY ACCEPTED NEVERTHELESS MY EXAMINATIONS OF NATLURAL GAS HAVE LED ME TO DOUIBT SOME OF HIS CONCLUSIONS WELL FOUNDED AS THEY SEEM THE MOST CAREFUL TESTS CARRIED ONI DURING A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS HAVE FAILED TO SHOW THE PRESENCE OF EITHER OLEFINES OR CARBON MONOXIDE IN THE NATURAL GAS OF WESTERN PENNSVLVANIA SOME OF THE CONSTITUENITS OF GAS ARE SOLUBLE IN WATER THIS IS NOTABLY THE CASE WITH CARBONI DIOXIDE BUTANE HEXANE ETC IF ETHYLENE AND CARBON MONOXIDE HAVE BEEN PRODUCED EVEN IN MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION IN THE ROCKS THAN ENGLER FINDS IN MENHADEN OIL GAS THESE SUBSTANICES WOULD NIOW OCCUR IN THE NATURAL GAS OF PENNSYL VANIA ETHYLENE WOULD GIVE TO THE GAS SUCH ILLUMINATING POWER THAT THERE WOULD BE NO OCCASIONI FOR THE USE OF COAL GAS IN ANLY TOWN IN THE WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA GAS REGION AS A MATTER OF FACT NATULAL GAS IS ALMOST USELESS AS AN ILLUMINIANT ITS LIGHT BEING EQUAL TO 5 TO 11 CANDLES PER FIVE FEET OF GAS CONSUMED

PRESENIT GAS INISPECTOR OF THE COUNTY STATES THAT THE ILLUMIIINATING POWEL OF NATURAL GAS AS SUIPPLIED TO PITTSBTURGH IN NOVEMBER 1892 IS A LITTLE LESS THAN 11 CANDLES PER FIVE FEET PER HOUR THE REASON FOR THIS IS THAT NATURAL GAS AS FOUND IN PENNSYLVANIA DOES NOT CONITAIN OLEFINES IF CAR BON MONOXIDE OCCURR ED IN GAS THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN INNUMERABLE CASES OF POISONING AMONG WORKMEN AT GAS WELLS IT IS COMMON TO FIND SUCH LEAKS OF GAS ABOUT THE MAJORITY OF GAS WELLS THAT NO ONE COULD STRIKE FIRE AT A WELL WITHOUT RISK OF FATAL CONSEQUENCES ALTHOUGH INHALING THE ESCAPING GAS FOR MUCH OF A

DIOXIDE PRODUCED IN THE COM BUSTION WAS ABSORBED BY BARYTA SOLUITION OF KNOWNL STRENGTH AND THE EXCESS OF BARYTA DETERMINED BY STANDARD OXALIC ACID THE FOLLOWING FACTS ARE OF ESPECIAL INITEREST 1 THE CARBON DIOXIDE INCREASES TOWARDS THE END OF THE DECAY 2 THE HYDRO GEN STEADILY DIMINISHES 3 METHANE OCCURS ONLY IN TRACES 4 NITROGEN OCCURS INRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAI PROPERTIES OF GASES 235 SUCH CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY AS TO RENDER IT PROBABLE THAT THIS GAS IS SET FIEE IN THE PROCESS OF DECAY THE SAME APPARATUS WAS KEPT IN POSITION FOR TWO AND A HALF YEARS AFTER THE ABOVE EXPERIMENITS WERE FINIISHED DURING THAT TIME A CONTINUOUS PRODUCTION OF GAS WAS OBSERVED BUT IT WAS SO SLOW THAT AT THE END OF THIS PERIOD ONLY ABOUT 30 CC OF GAS COLLECTED THIS WAS FOUND TO CONSIST OF METHANIE I HAVE EXAMINED THE GASES PRODUCED IN SWAMPY GROUNLD IN MANY DIFFERENT PLACES SAMPLES WERE TAKEN FIOM STREAMS HAVINIG MUDDY BOTTOMS AIID IN WHICH VEGETABLE MATTER HIAD COLLECTED SAMPLES OF GAS HAVE ALSO BEEN TAKEN FROM SALT MARSHES ON THE COAST OF MAINE GAS HAS ALSO BEEN COLLECTED FROM THE VERY DEEP ACCUMULATIONIS OF MUD AND DECAYING VEGETABLE REMAINS FOUND IN SOME PARTS OF LAKE CHAUTAUQUA THE GENERAL RESULT OF EXAMINATIONS OF THESE GAS SAMPLES MAY BE STATED TO THE EFFECT THAT THE GAS OCCURRIING IN SHALLOW SWAMPS AND STREAMS CONISISTS OF METHANE CARBON DIOXIDE AND NITROGEN IN SOME OF THE MUCH DEEPER SWAMP WATERS WHERE MASSES OF VEGETABLE DEBBRIS OF GREATER THICKNIESS ARE FOUND AS IN LAKE CHAUTAUQUA HYDROGEN OCCURS IN VERY SMALL QUANTITY GREAT DIFFICULTY IS EXPERIENCED IN TAKINIG SAMPLES OF GAS FROM LOCALITIES OF THE LATTER TYPE TAPPEINER OBSERVES THAT THE MARSHGAS FER MENTATION IS VERY PROBABLY A VERY IMPORTANT SOURCE OF METHANE IN NATURE THE FACT THAT BURIED VEGETABLE MATTERS MAY AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD OF RAPID GAS EVOLUTION PASS INTO A CONDITION OF EXTREMELY SLOW DECAY ADDS GREATER FORCE TO THE ORIGINAL THEORY OF PETROLEUM AND GAS THE OCCURRENCE OF SO LARGE A PROPORTION OF FIEE HYDROGEN AMONG THE GASES EVOLVED BY VEGETATION IN PROCESS OF DECAY IS A MATTER OF GREAT INTEREST AS IT SUGGESTS THE EXISTENCE OF AN IMPORTANT SOURCE OF HYDROGENI WLHEREVER DEEPLY SUBMERGED PLANT REMAINS OCCUR FRANKLAND J CH SOC 1883 P 295 FOUND THAT GRASS LEFT TO DECAY UNDER WATER AIR BEINIG EXCLUDED EVOLVED GAS IN THREE DAYS OF THE FOLLOWING COMPOSITION CARBON DIOXIDE  8463 PER CENT OXYGEN

CONTINUED PROCESS OF DECAY AFTER THE FIRST DECOMPOSITION SUCH REMAINS MIGHT BECOME ACCUMULATED ANID BURIED DEEPLY UNDER SEDIMENTS BEFORE THE TISSUES ARE MATERIALLY ALTERED THE GENERATION OF GAS MIGHT THEN PROCEED IN THE COLD IT SEEMS HARDLY POSSIBLE TO IGNORE THIS PROBABLE SOURCE OF NATURAL GAS IN DISCUSSING ANY THEORY AS TO ITS ORIGIN ESPE236 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES CIALLY WHENI IT IS CONSIDERED THAT NO OTHER PROCESS IN NATURE HAS BEEN FOUND TO VIELD A GAS AT ALL SIMILAR IN COMPOSITIONI TO THAT FOUND IN THE ROCKS OF THE THREE HYPOTHESES WHICH HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS TWO ARE OPEN TO A SERIOUS OBJECTION THE CHEMICAL CHANGES STUPPOSED BY ENGLER TO HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE WOULD PROB ABLY YIELD GAS DIFFEIRENT IN COMPOSITION FROM THE NATURAL GAS NOW BEING OBTAINED IN SUCH LARGE QUANTITY IN WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA AND IF THE GAS ORIGINALLY CONTAINED ETHYLENE AND CARBON MONIOXIDE IT IS NOT EASY TO EXPLAIN THEIR COMPLETE DISAPPEARANCE IN THE NIATTURAL GAS I HAVE EXAMINED FIOM WELLS SCATTERED OVER SO LARGE A REGION THE HYPOTHESIS OF MEIIDELEEFF WOULD BE MUCH MORE DIFFICULT TO RECONCILE WITH THE FACTS AS REGARDS COMPOSITION THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF HYDROGEN COUILD NOT BE EASILY EXPLAINED THE ONLY PROCESS IN NATURE WHICH IS KINIOWN TO YIELD GAS SIMILAR IN ITS CONSTITUENTS TO NATURAL GAS IS THAT WHICH OCCURS IN SWAMPS AND DECAYING MASSES OF SUBMERGED VEGETABLE REMAINS THE IMPORTANT FACT THAT THE SOLID PLANT TISSUES MAY BE PRESERVED FOR LONG PERIODS AFTER THE PRELIMINARYR GAS EVOLUITION HAS CEASED SHOWS THAT THE REMAINS ARE LIKELY TO BECOME SLOWLY BURIED TO UNDERGO THE FERMENTATIOIL CHANGES LEADING TO THE PRODUCTIOTN OF METHANE ANIMAL TISSUES CAN SUFFER NO SUCH AIREST OF DECOMPOSITION DECAY ONCE SET IN IS CARRLIED RAPIDLY ONWARD TO COMPLETE DESTRUCTION WITHOULT INTERMISSION THE CON TRAST BETWEEN THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH ANIMAL AND PLANIT REMAINS OCCUR IN THE ROCKS SEEMS TO JUSTIFY THIS STATEMENT IF CHEMICAL EVIDENCE SHALL COTUNT IN THE DISCUSSION IT IS DIFFICULT TO FIND A MORE SATISFACTORY EXPLANIATION THAN THE OLDER HYPOTHESES WHICH THE GEOLOGISTS ADVANCED ALTHOUGH IN THEIR TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT THE STRICTLY CHEMICAL ARGUMENTS WERE NEGLECTED

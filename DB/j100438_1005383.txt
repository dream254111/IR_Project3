Peninsylvania and other Regions VI A Method for the Quantitative Anialysis of Natural Gas VII Origini of Natural Gas anid Petroleum INTRODUCTION The purpose of the following research as originally begun was to study ex haustively the composition of natural gas as founid in Westerni Pennsylvania Dur ing a series of analyses by Bunsens methods using eudiometers calibrated with great care and making readings by means of a Grunot cathetometer of superior construction many difficulties were encounltered which were not easily overcome More exact methods for the positive identification of the various constituents of a gas mixture seemed necessary and finaally a study of the qualitative reactions of gases was undertaken Since the publication of Btunsens Gasometrische Methoden A P SVOL XVII T150 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES the introduction of the various forms of apparatus proposed by iempel and Winkler has tended to greatly simplify quantitative gas analysis The majority of absorptioni gasometric methods are based upon the assumption that the contraction undergone by the volume of a gas on exposure to a liquid reagent is not onily a measure of the percentage of a particular constituent of the gas mix ture but that the identity of such constituent is established by thie same operation This assumption is very often warranted by the facts but occasionally leads to error Qualitative methods for the recognition of different gases have usually been held wholly subordinate to qualntitative absorption or explosioll methods Qluantitative analyses are far more reliable if the constituents to be determined can be positively identified by independent methods and it is somewhat strange that heretofore the qualitative side of gas analysis should have received so small a share of attention In the following work an attempt has been made to collect togfether the more impor tant reactions of the commonly occurring gases The results must be regarded as a first attempt only inasmuch as improved methods of preparation anid purification will doubtless involve the necessity of corrections in certain cases Accurate methods of qualitative gas analysis are likely to prove of increasing importance in the study of the atmosphere in the laboratory and in the chemical arts The following sub division of the subject has been fotund convenient 1 Phenomena of oxidation of hydrogeni anid hydrocarbons by air in presence of finiely divided metals anid other oxidizing agents 2 Reactions of gases towards various metallic salts and other compounds used in

hydrochloric acid dried and weighed was moisteDed with palladium chloride solu tionl Alcohol was dropped oni the asbestos and ignited After burning off the alcohol a few times the asbestos was heated in a Bunsen burner flame and the treat menit with palladium chloride and alcohol repeated With care it is possible to obtain a fairly uniform coating of palladium although the metal tends somewhat to collect on the surface of the fibres Asbestos fibre containing an amount of palla dium equal to 6 per cent of the total asbestos plus palladium wasi used in the fol lowing experiments About 03 gin of this asbestos was placed in a glass tube of oneeighthinch bore This tube was then heated in an iron oveni having its lower portion filled up to the level of the glass tube with iron tuirninigs so that the glass tube rested on and was partly covered by the turnings A thermometer was inserted into the turninigs In some of the experiments the apparatus described on p 154 was used In the Be richte der d chem Ges 1879 pp 636 and 1006 two articles appeared by W Hempel on the determination of hydrogen iii gas mixttures by means of palladium sponge In the former article it is proposed to remove the hydrogen by occlusion in the latter by oxidation Winlkler in his Technical Gas Analysis p 81 employs palla dium asbestos for oxidation and determination of hydrogen in presence of methane and other paraffins in water gas coal gas etc In order to study the limits and possibilities of these methods and their applicability to various gas mixtures the following experiments were made 1 HYDROGENHydrogen is not easily obtained pure all authors who have had occasioni to study its properties agree upon this The purest zinc contains car bon and hydrogen made by the action of sulphuric acid upoIl this metal is contami nated by traces of hydrocarbons Other metals have been tried Aluminiumn was dissolved in sulphuric acid and also in caustic soda solution magnesium and cad mium were dissolved in hydrochloric acid sodium and potassium in water In every case however the hydrogen evolved contains hydrocarlbons as was showni by the production of carbon dioxide on buLrning After various trials the following plan has been found to give satisfactory results The purest zinc obtainable stuch as is sold in sticks for use in Marshs test for arseniic was dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid The gas was passed 1 through a 6 per cent solution of permanganate of152 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES potassiuim acidulated by sulphuric acid 2 through a glass tube

oxide especially for removing sulphtiretted hydrogeni Hydrogen so purified coontainied only traces of a paraffin which calculated as CH4 amouinted to less than 002 per cent of tlle hy drogen By very carefuLl tests no phosphorus arsenic sulphur or antimony could be found iExpt lA mixture was made of hydrogeni anid air in the following proportions Air    80 Hydrogen  20 This mixture contained in a gasholder was caused to flow slowly over 6 per cent palladium asbestos which was contained in an oneeighthinch glass tube heated in the oven Trhe rate of flow of the hydrogen and air mixture could be controlled by causing it to buibble through sulphuric acid before entering the palladium asbestos tube Some aihydrous copper sulphate was placed in the far end of tlle palladium tube which by its change of color to a bright blue serves as a delicate moistuire indicator TEMPERATURE OF ASBESTOS TUBE RATE OF GAS FLOW RESULT 20  100 cub cent in five ii  No moisture 0     500     M oisture formed

temperature of 50600 At the above rate 100 cc in five minutes there is a strong tenidency to cause glowing of tlhe palladlium asbestos not throughouit but in minute points where the palladium had accumiutlated in thicker particles This glowincg may take place while the tube is at any temperature between 156 and 100 and depends wholly on the rate of flow of the hydrogen mixture It is independent of the temperature outside the tube and it is therefore not possible to prevent or arrest it except by reducinlg theRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 153 rate of flow The hydrogen by its rate of burning determines the temperature and the low specific heat of the palladium and feeble conductivity of the asbestos neces sarily increase the tendency to glow Using air anld hydrogen 5 1 repeatedly no explosion ever occurred although the palladium ofteni glowed with great intensity This is also true of palladium asbestos conitaining 30 per cenit of palladium and wheni the temperature was carried to 1350 C Air containing only 1 per cenlt of hydrogen may cause initense glowing of the palladium if the rate of flow is rapid Immersion of the tube in cold water will not prevent glowing Caution is necessary should a mixture of oxygen and hydrogen be exposed to palladium In experiments made with tubes of onemillimeter bore and at a temperature of 1000 it was found that the hydrogeni in burning causes a series of sharp explosions very different from the quiet and slow oxidation which invariably characterizes the mixture of air and hydrogen Expt 2To determine the degree of completeness of the oxidation of hydrogen by palladium asbestos Air 90 go Hydrogen  10 The palladium tube was heated to 600700 C Gas escaping from the palladium tube was passed throtugh oil of vitriol and phosphoric anhydride in order to dry thoroughly then through a second porcelain tube containing palladium asbestos and finally inlto a small weighed tube of phosphoric anhydride The second palla dium tube was heated to intense redness It was fouLnid that absolutely nio moisture was formed in the second contact with palladium althotugh 5 liters of the gas mix ture were used and the rate of flow varied from 40 to 100 buibbles per minute It was shown moreover that complete oxidation is independent of the glowing of the palladium Hence the oxidation of hydrogen by air in presence of palladium is complete at a temperature of 6070 when the gas mixture is dry Quantitative experiments to be detailed later showed that in the case of air containing 02 of hvdrogen a cor rect determination of the hydrogen was possible The temperature in this case was 1000 C If the hydrogen anid air mixture is moist oxidation is easily and completely attained at ordinary temperatures

change occurred till the gold asbestos was strongly heated over flame and even then the oxidation was exceedinigly slow so that repeated passages of the gas were required to produce complete oxidation In the precedinig experiment a Hempels apparatus was used Expt 4 Platinum Asbestos Air 0 90 Hydrogen  10 The results were scareely distinguishable from those obtained with palladium asbes tos Palladiium causes oxidation with somewhat greater intensity and at lower temperatures Determinations of hvdrogeni in mixtures of known proportionsusing a Hempel apparatus gave very correct results Expt 5 Iridiunm Asbestos Air  90 Hydrogen 0   10 When used in a Hempel apparatus in the cold or at 1000 C iridium seemed to have very little influence causing only a slight contraction in volume even after the gas had passed the iridium many times Expt 5 Air  90 H ydrogen   10 Palladiuim asbestos was moistenied with a solution of carboniate of potash and dr ied at a lheat which was insufficient to cause fusion or sintering In several trials tlle alkali was found to seriously retard oxidation of the hydrogeni which was not fully buriut until the gas mixture had been repeatedly in one case ten times passed through the tube at 1000 HYDROCARBONS Description of ApparatusA is an iron gas pipe six inches in diameter anld thirtyfour inclhes long closed at both ends by heavy asbestos board Four iron pipes of threesixteeiithsinch bor e are placed in the centre passingf through the asbestos ends and giving the apparatus the appearance of a boiler witlh four flues B B are two side necks of onehalfinch pipe The whole interior space around the four small iton pipes is filled with iron turniings Glass tubes of onleeighth inch bore containing the metalcoated asbestos or otlher reagent could be pushed through the small iron pipes Thermometers were placed in the side necks B B Supposing the arrow to represent the direction of flow of the gas current through the gas tubes the mnetalcoated asbestos was in the experiments placed at theRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 155 point D and of the two thermometers E was kept a few degrees higher than F the purpose being to have the gas heated nearly to the temperature of the hottest part of the oveni before it reached that point Thus it was not possible for the gas stream to exert a cooling effect upon the metalcoated asbestos This apparatus is superior to an ordinary sheetironi oven as the glass tubes are heated by actual contact rather than by radiation Repeated trials have shown that if a thermometer be inserted in the side neck and a second one in one of the long horizontal iron tubes the differ ence in the indications of the two thermometers will amouint only to an insignificant G  A  BA 0G Iron oven used in experiments upon oxidation temperatures fraction of a degree Centigrade Nitrogenfilled mercury thermometers were used up to 3000 in the following experiments and in order to measure higher tempelra tures metallic salts of known fusing poinit wer e employed A few gr ains or crystals of the carefully purified salt were placed in a fine glass tube previously drawn out to a point Such a tube was placed in the side neck of the ironi oven and plunged into the iron turnings The temperature of oxidation of the hydrocarbon gas could then be ascertained to occur between the meltinig points of two salts This method which is simply an adaptation of the process commonly used for the determination of melting points proved very satisfactory It was not possible to employ an air thermometer as this would have necessitated an inconveniently large oven The following list of substances with their melting points includes those which were used in the experiments detailed below Potassium nitrate  3390 Potassium chlorate  3590 Lead iodide  3830 Cadmium iodide  4040 Barium chlorate t 414156 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES Thallium iodide  4390 Lead chloride  4980 Silver bromide  5270 Potassium iodate  5820 Barium nitrate  5930 Landolt and Bornsteins Tables and J Ch Soc 1888 p 63 The following general method was used in studying oxidation temperatures of hydrocarbons Air containing a small measured percentage of the hydrocarbon was agitated with caustic soda solution to remove carbon dioxide It was then caused to flow through the bottle G containing lime water This served to show whether the gas had beeni completely freed from CO2 The gas then traversed the palladium asbestos or other reagent contained in the glass tube in the oven and finally a second bottle of lime water H On heating the oven the temperature of oxidation of the hydro carbon could be recognized by the precipitate of carbonate of lime in the second lime water bottle As an indicator for CO2 in the oxidation experimenlts solutions of baryta stronltia and lime were all tried The solubilities of the carbonates accord ing to Fresenius are as follows BaCO3  one part in 14137 parts water SrCO3 18045 CaCO3  10601 Baryta water appears to be the most delicate test On account of its extreme sensitiveness however it is niot easily preserved free from turbidity and lime water was found sufficiently sensitive for almost all purposes The same general method above detailed was used in all the following experiments It seemed desirable at the outset to test the question Do the hydrogen and car bon of a hydrocarbon burn simultaneously In the oxidation of a hydrocarbon in preselnce of excess of air it seems probable that the hydrogeni and carbon must burni simultaneously to H20 and CO2 It is possible however that under the coniditions above described a selective oxidation of hydrogen might occur involving the formation of a condensation product Thus H4 might yield acetylene 2 CH4  03 3 1H20  CA and no 002 2 CH4 might yield C2114 2 CH4  2 0 C2H4  2 H20 and no C02 As reagents for the detection of moistuLre in a gas the following substances were tried Anhydrous cobalt chloride anhydrous copper sulphate phosphoric anhydride a mixture of green vitriol with ferricyanide of potassium the green vitriol being inRESEARCHES UPON THIE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 157 its crystallized form and containing therefore 7 mols water This salt and the ferri cyanide of potassium were ground separately and mixed just previously to the ex periment anhydrous sulphate of iron was found not to give satisfactory results A little of the mixture placed in the end of the glass tube was found to be a delicate indicator for moistuire assuming quickly a deep blue color Expt 7 Air  969 Ethylene  31 This gas mixture was passed through soda solution anid then dried by oil of vitriol It then traversed the palladium asbestos which was gradually heated in the ovenl At the far end of the same glass tube the gas passed over about 01 gin of the green vitriol and ferricyanide of potassium mixture cold and finally into lime water It was found that the lime water became milky a few moments before the powder turnled blue This change to blue took place however immediately afterwards and before any further increase in the temperature of the oven had occurred As the lime water is a much more sensitive reagent towards 002 than is the green vitriol mixture towards moisture it is natural that the CO2 should produce its effect a little in advance of the water vapor Similar experiments were tried with methane The results were the same as with ethylene Expt 8 Air  969 Methane  31 This mixture moist was found after passing the palladium asbestos to cause nio reduction in palladium chlor ide solution see reactions in solution and hence no oxi dation of CH0 to 21H4 had occurred There is therefore no reason to suppose that under the circumstanices which prevailed in the apparatus above described eithei constituent of the hydrocarbon is oxidized before the other The hydrocarbon yields directly CO2 and HO PARAFFINS 2 METHANEThis hydrocarboni was prepared by the method of Gladstone and Tribe Jour Chem Soc 1881 p 1541 Methyl iodide of normal boiling point was caused to flow in admixture with alcohol uponi  copperzinc couple The resuilting gas was freed from alcohol vapor by oil of vitriol It was then washed with brominie water and the bromine vapors subsequently removed by ferrous sulphate solution Finally it was passed over dry palladium chloride at 500 to remove any possible A P svor xvii u158 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES traces of hydrogen The following explanation of the reaction is given by the authors cited CH31  Zn Cu  H20  CH4  Zn 1 Cu OH 200 cc of the methane so prepared were burned and the products aspirated through soda solution On testinig thie latter for halogen no traces could be found From this it was evident that

Sabanejef Ber IX p 1810 This method was found to give very satisfactory results The process usuially given in the textbooks by heating acetate of soda with alkali is very unsatisfactory both as regards purity and quantity of product Expt 9 Paalladitm Asbestos MIethane 31 Air969 Oxidation to CO2 occurred at the followinig temperatures 1 Above melting point of CdI 4040 2 cc cc   Cd2 4040 3     Ba C1032 4140 4     CdT2 5     Ba C1032 4140 In the above trials methanie fronm methyl iodide was used The preceding experimenit was repeated using methane from chloroform In six different trials the temperature of oxidation was found to be between the melting points of CdT2 and AgCl 4040 to 4510 In one trial oxidation occurred consid erably above the melting point of AgCl The temperature of oxidation of methane is therefore extremely high as com pared with that of hydrogen Hempel in his excellent work on gas analysis says that methane prepared from sodiuLm acetate is oxidized by palladium at 2100 My results do not confirm this statement The difference is possibly duie to impurities in the methane Expt 10 PalladiumPlatinum Asbestos Air  969 Methane  31 Asbestos was moistened alternatelv with palladium chlorile and platinum chloride and the metals reduced by burning  alohol as already described the object being toRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 159 produce an intimate mixture of both in finely divided state Oxidation occurred in four trials between the melting points of CdI2 and AgCl The mixture of the two metals is therefore no more efficient than palladium alone Expt 11 Platinunm Asbestos Air  969 Methane  31 Oxidation occurred in five trials at a temperature just below the melting point of AgGl Expt 12 Gold Asbestos Air  969 Methane  31 Oxidation occurred at a temperature of dull redness In this last experiment a Hempel apparatus was used According to Mallard anid Le Chatelier methanle inflames at 7800 Ann des Mines 1880 p 201 3 ETHANEThis gas was prepared from ethyl iodide by the method of Glad stone and Tribe already described The resulting gas was purified from alcohol vapors by prolonged contact with oil of vitriol It was theni treated with potash solution and with palladium chloride dry 200 cc of the gas so purified yielded oni burning no trace of halogen when the product of combustion was aspirated through potash solutioni Expt 13 Palladium Asbestos Ethane  31 Air  961 In several trials made with ethane the temperature of oxidation was found to be between the meltinig points of cadmium iodide and silver bromide Parallel trials were then made using air containing 31 per cent of methane from methyl iodide in one tube and 31 per cent ethane in the other Both tubes were charged with portions of the same lot of palladium asbestos and both were heated simultaneously in the iron oven so that the conditionis to which the two gases were subjected were as nearly as possible identical In ten trials oxidation occurred in both tubes in the neighborhood of the melting point of silver chloride but it was noticeable that the methane was oxidized in eight of the experiments a little earlier and hence at a slightly lower temperature than the ethane The more complex hydrocarbon C21H6 is at least as stable and probably somewhat more stable than the lower CH0 A parallel case is probably to be found in the difference in stability of the correspond160 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES ing alcohols towards reducing agents Methyl alcohol is decomposed on warming with powdered zinc with

isopropyl iodide and copperzinic couple The reaction is much slower than in the case of methane and ethane the yield is however satisfactory The same method of purification was used as in the case of methane The gas was found to be free from iodine compounds Jlxvpt 14 Palladiunm Asbestos Propane         31 Air     969 Oxidation occurred at the following temperatures 1 Above melting point of

5 ISOBUTANEThis hydrocarbon was prepared by the method of Gladstone and Tribe from isobutyl iodide and copperzinc couple It was purified by the method followed in the case of the preceding hydrocarbon and was proved to be free from iodine compounds Expt 15 Palladium Asbestos Isobutane 31 31 Air  969 Oxidation occuirred at the following tempeiatures 1 At 2360 3 At 2500 5 At 2250 2 1 2250 4 it 2200 6

action 6 PENTANEPetroleum gasolene which had been kept several weeks in con tact with concentrated sulphuric acid was fractionated and the fraction boiling atRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 161 about 370 C was used for the following experimenits It was mainly pentane as was shown by a vapor delnsity determination but contained no doubt small quanti ties of other lowboilinig paraffins Purified air was aspirated through a Woulfe bottle containing a little of the liquid Expt 17 Palladium AsbestosOxidation occurred 1 At 2100 3 At 1800 5 At 2100 2  2000 4  1700 7 HEPTANE Theoline a commercial product formerly replacing benzol in the San Francisco market and manufactured by distilling a resin from the tree Pinus sabiniana was shown by Thorpe Chem Soc Jour 1879 p 296 to consist of nor mal heptane in an impure state By digestion with oil of vitriol the paraffin is obtained pure and of constant boiling point between 98 and 990 C Heptane was the highest paraffin uised in the trials of oxidation temperatures As this hydro carbon is readily obtained in a state of purity and as it was the most complex par affin employed it seemed desirable to ascertain whether on oxidation by palladium asbestos anly unsaturated hydrocarbon resulted Expt 18 Palladium AsbestosAir was aspirated through a Woulfe bottle containing heptaine and then through the heated palladium asbestos tube Oxidation occurred at the following temperatuires 1 At 2700 3 At 2800 5 At 3000 2  2700 4  2750 6  2900 While the experiment was in progress the air escaping from the palladium asbestos tube was passed through soda solution to absorb the CO formed and then into palladium chloride solution and finally into lime water The palladium chloride was reduced to metal and the lime water following it was rendered milky see reac tions of CO in solution This result occurred only when the air was insufficient for complete oxidation of the heptane With an excess of air only CO2 and H20 were formed and no unsaturated hydrocarbon could be detected olefines and acety lenes would have caused a reactioni in palladium chloride solutioni see reactions of these hydrocarbons in solution It seems therefore that oxidation of the paraffins CH4 C2H6        CH16 even when carried on at the lowest possible temper atures by excess of air in presence of palladium asbestos yields only CO2 and H20 although by no means ill quantities proportional to the amoulnt of the hydrocarbon originally used OLEFINES 8 ETHIYLENEThis hydrocarbon on account of the ease with which it is pre pared and its low temperature of oxidation is well suited to the study of reactions162 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES and it has received in the present work a larger share of attentioni thani any other gas Ethylene was prepared by the method of Erlenmever and Bunte Ann der Chem u Pharm Vol CLXVIII p 64 The yield is however small as compared with the theoretical The older method of Mitscherlich Kolbe Lehrb d Organ Ulem Vol I p 349 according to which the vapor of boiling alcohol is led into a mixture of 10 parts sulphuric acid and 3 parts water at a temperature of 1650 C yields more ether than ethylene althouglh it possesses the advantage that frothing is avoided Whatever the strength of the sulphuric acid used there is always pro duced a large proportion of ether which cannot be absorbed by rapid bubbling through sulphuric acid Part of this ether vapor is removable by agitation with a large volume of cold water Its complete removal requires prolonged conitact with oil of vitriol The gas was purified by soda solution containing bichromate of potash and digested with oil of vitriol for several days Ethylene was also prepar ed by the action of zinc upon C2H4Br J Clh Soc 2 XII Ethylene dibr omide dissolved in 2 parts alcohol was introduced by tap fun nel into a flask containing zinc powder and connected by a reversed condeniser with a gasometer The same method of purification by sulphuric acid was used as in the preceding case This method is in every way very satisfactory for the preparation of small quantities of ethylene Expt 19 Palladium Asbestos Ethylene

AsbestosThe same mixtur e of ethylene anld air was used The ranige of temperatures at which oxidation occurred was about the same as in the case of the preceding experiment showing that the mixture of the two metals is no more efficient than palladium alonie Expt 21 Air  969 Ethylene  31 30 per cent palladium asbestos was moistened with cobalt nitrate solution dried and ignited in order to coat the asbestos with peroxide of cobalt On passing the gas mixture carbon dioxide was produced at the following temperatures 1 At 2770 2 At 250 3 ALt 260RESEARCHES UPON THt CHEMICALj PROPERTIES OF GASES 163 Hence the presence of an easily reducible metallic oxide does not seem to increase the oxidizinig action of the palladium Expt 22Several trials were then made in order to ascertain whether by the same general method ethylene could be exhaustively burned It was found that using air containing 31 per cent of ethylene oxidation is only complete i e to CO2 and H120 when the palladium asbestos is brought to a temperature of bright redness At a dull red heat the hydrocarbon may pass partiallv uuburnt A plat inum wire spiral heated by an electric current was found to be less efficient than palladium asbestos Expt 23 Absorption of Ethylene by PalladiuAmPure ethylene i e unmixed with air was passed over 2 gms of finely divided palladium contained in a Hempel tube heated to 100 A considerable absorption of the gas occurred varying in sev eral trials from 2 to 5 cc according to the duration of the experiment Unmixed with an excess of air it appears therefore that ethylene may undergo an absor ption which might cause serious errors irn a quantitative gas analysis With palladium asbestos 6 per cent palladium no occlusion of ethylene sufficient to effect the vol ume of the gas could be observed Expt 24 Ruthenium Asbestos Air  969 Ethylene   31 Oxidation occurred at the following temperatures 1 At 2940 3 At 2740 2  2810 4  320 Expt 25 Osmium Asbestos Ethylee 31 Air  969

carbon does niot occur each time at the same temperature 7rhe variations are often so great as to preclude the supposition that a cause is to be sought in different con164 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMfCAL PROPERTIES OF GASES ditions of the experiment To ascertain as fully as possible the limits of variation in the temperature of oxidation the following trials were made Excpt 26Instead of metalcoated asbestos a platinum wire one millimeter thick and one inch long was placed in the oneeighthinch glass tube in the oven The same mixture of air and ethylene was used as in the preceding experiments As in all previous work the oven was allowed to cool down after each trial and before the next one was begun In every case the temperature was very gradually raised until oxidation as indicated by the precipitation in the lime water occurred The gas stream was carefully regulated being maintained at a uniform rate in all the tr ials Oxidation occuirred at the following temperatur es 1 At 2700 9 At 3000 17 At 2200 2  2900 10  2650 18  2550 3  3900 11  2100 19  2100 4  2900 12  2170 20  2200 5  3100 13  2200 21  2350 6  2890 14  2250 22  2000 7  2950 15  2000 23  2100 8  3000 16  2100 24  2250 As no effort had been spared to secure absolute uniformity of conditions the conclusion seems justified that oxidation of the hydrocarbon ethylene occurs within somewhat wide limits of temperature Expt 27Air containing 31 per cent ethylene was passed through a glass tube containing pieces of glass tubing which had been previously ignited No oxi dation occurred at the melting point of bromide of silver 4270 during four hours Exjpt 28 Air 99 Ethylene  31 This mixture was passed as before over a platinum wire and the temperature grad ually raised until a carboni dioxide reaction was produced This occurred at 2400 The gas stream was then continued while the temperature was allowed to fall The lime water was repeatedly replaced but each time became rapidly milky Oxidation was continuous until the temperature fell to about 110 at which poinlt fresh lime water was found to remain clear Hence platinum baving been sufficiently heated to induce oxidation of ethylene by atmospheric oxygen retains this power while the temperatture is lowered to a point which would have been wholly insufficient to cause such oxidation if the temperature were rising instead of falling This is true more over when the gas stream flows at the rate of 20 to 50 bubbles per minute so slowly therefore that there is no possibility that this effect is attribtutable to anRESEARCHES UPON TtlE ChIEMICAL

added by a tap funnel and at a temperature of 400 the reaction begins The gas so produced was washed with water and digested with oil of vitriol cold in which it is insoluble and finially washed by potash solution Propylene was also prepaied from allyl iodide Glad stone and Tribe J Ch Soc 1874 and also Niderist Ann Ch Pharm CXcvl p 358 20 cc of allyl iodide mixed with three volumes of alcohol were pouired over 30 gm powdered zillc coIntaining 10 gm of mossy zinc heated in a flask over a water bath Powdered zinc becomes during the reactioni a hard compact mass The addition of mossy zinc and

demonistrated the absence of iodine compounds from the product Beilstein and Wiegand Ber 1882 p 1498 prepare propylene by the action of propyl alcohol upon phosphoric anhydride In employing this method 120 gm PO0 were placed in a flask provided with a reversed condenser and propyl alcohol gradually added by a tap funnel The action is at first very violent anid reqtires cooling of the flask becomes less and less intense and finally it is found necessary to heat the flask over asbestos After about 130 cc of propyl alcohol had been added the reaction ceased The method is satisfactoiy although the yield is small A method proposed by Klauis and Kerstein Ber Vol IX p 695 according to whiclh zinc dust is heated with glycerine was tried but with tunsatisfactory results The intense frothling of the mixture renders the process uncontrollable In the various trials propylene as prepared by the first three methods just described was used That prepaled from allyl iodide seemed to be

alcohol were poured over 60 gm of zinc dust The reaction is as follows C IT2Br CI12 112  Zn z 12CH2  ZnBr2 The trimethylene dibrornide molecule on losing bromine assumes tne form of a rinig and the resulting hydrocarbon is therefore a saturated compound The gas is evolved at a gentle lheat tlhe temperature should not exceed 600 and is purified by passing through a condenser cooled by ice by digestion with sulphuric acid and finally by diluite permaniganate of potash solution It has been shown by Wagner Ber 1888 p 1230 that trimethylenie prepared by the above reaction is liable to containi propylene which may be removed by prolonged contact with a weak solution of permanganiate of potash which converts propylene into its correspondingr glycol buit does not attack the

11 ISOBUTYLENEThis hydrocarbon was prepared by the action of sulphuric acid upon isobutyl alcohol by the method of Puchot Ber 1883 p 2284 R 100 gm isobuityl alcohol were mixed cold with 100 gm oil of vitriol 160 gm sul phate of lime and 40 gm bisulphate of potash This mixture was heated using a flask with reversed condeinser to a temperature sufficient to cause a rapid evolution of gas Besides buityl ether and other less volatile compounds impurities in vapor form occur in the isobtutylene resulting from this process which is on this account unsatisfactorv The yield is comparatively large By the action of potash upon isobtutyl iodide a mucih purer product is obtained Isobutyl bromide may be used instead of the iodide In either case the use of potash in powdered form greatly facilitates the reactioni Potassiuim iodide being more soluble in alcohol than potassium bromide the alkyl iodide is to be preferred in reactions of the above type as potassium bromide resulting from the use of alkyl bromides encrusts the potash and retards the reaction Isobutylene prepared by the latter method was used in the followling experi ments It was carefully purified by digestion cold with sulphuric acid and oni testing was found to be free from iodine compounids Isobuitylene is soluble in water to a considerable extent anid should therefore be collected over salt solution Expt 34 Palladium

mixture of 50 gm ethylene bromide with 150 gm alcohol was added in small portions by a tap fuinnel The escaping acetylene was caused to bubble through boiling potash solution and then absorbed by aminoniacal cuprous chloride solutioln The resulting red precipitate was washed with ammoni acal copper solution then by weak ammonia After washing the precipitate was brought into a flaskL and decomposed by hydrochloric acid and the acetylene thus168 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES evolved was collected The copper precipitate conisists of CuP2C and on treatment with hydrochloric acid undergoes the reaction Cu2C2  2 HC1 Cu2CI2  C2H2 For an interesting description of this compound see Keyser Am Chem Jr 1892 p 285 The precipitate of copper acetylide must be preserved in an unoxidized state previous to its treatment with hydrochloric acid in order to liberate acetylene If exposed to air during washing the precipitate is found to remain almost unacted upon by lhydrochloric acid and the yield of acetylene from the copper compound will be insignificant On this account the washing should be conducted in an atmos phere of carbon dioxide A very interesting method for the preparation of acetylene by the action of water upon barium carbide has beeni described by Maquenne Compt Rend CXV p 558 Barium carbonate is reduced by magnesium powder in presence of excess of carbon As the result of the somnewhat violent reaction bariuin carbide is formed Oni moistening with water this carbide is decomposed yielding nearly pure acetylene Expt 35 Palladium

careful tests that no CO is formed in the case of the above mixture In fact no other products resulted than CO2 and H20 Acetylene seems therefore to be more stable towards heated air in presence of palladium asbestos than the olefines and in this respect even to rival the paraffinis 13 BENZOLThe low boiling point of benzol and the common occurrence of its vapor in gas mixtures justify its consideration in connection with the gaseous hydrocarbons Expt 36Air aspirated through benzol prepared from benzoic acid and then through palladium asbestos was found to yield carbon dioxide at the

careful experimenits with the vapors of meta para and orthoxylol were tried as it seemed possible that these three isomer s might exhibit different temperatures of oxidation dependenit upon the

1 At 194 3 At 1820 2  2090 4  1880 The preceding experiments serve to illustrate some important facts regarding the oxidation of gaseous hydrocarbons 1 The temperature of oxidation is mainly dependent upon the solid bodies with which the gas is in contacta fact which is not new 2 Two phases are often buLt not always to be observed in the process of oxida tion As the temperatuire rises a point is reached at which a nminute and scarcely recognizable trace of carbon dioxide appears After the slow oxidation has con tinued for some time and gradually increased dulring a rise of temperature of 20 30170 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES or even more degrees a sudden intense reactionl occurs in the lime water suggesting the change from smouldering fire to actual flame Very often this slow oxidation is not observed and the carbon dioxide reactioni occurs in the lime water suddenly anid with full intensity The lhydrocarbon molecule seems to exist at high tempera tures in a condition of unlstable equilibrium towards oxygen In the preceding statements the temperatures given are those of decided and intense reactioni in the lime water 3 The oxidation of a hydrocarbon by air uinder conditions similar in all re spects does n1ot occur always at the same temperature It may vary within rather wide limits of the thermometer scale A variation in the propoltion of

following order beginining with the most active 1 OsmiuLm 2 palladium 3 platinum riuthenium 4 iridum 5 rhodium 6 gold Osmiuim is decidedly the most powerful causing oxidation of ethylene even below 150O Rhodium is less efficienit as regards oxidation of hydrogen than palla dium Oxidizing power is apparently not dependent upon atomic weight Of these metals osmium in fine division is the most easily converted into an oxide Heated in a flame it burns exhibiting much the appearance of burning lampblack and yields as is well known the volatile osmium tetroxide At muchi lower temperatures the metal is slowly oxidized and volatilized Palladium in fine division is converted into a stable oxide PdO on heating to redness Wilm Ber 1892 p 220 Plat inum and gold are not oxidizable in air at any temperature Ruthenium oxidizesRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 171 to a sesquioxide at a red heat Rhodium is convertible into a monoxide In the case of the majority of these metals the tendency to form an unstable oxide which readily gives up its oxygeni explains the oxidizing power upon hydrocarbons When it is considered however that platinuim which induces oxidationi nearly as readily as palladium does not produce directly an oxide when heated in air the oxidizinig power possessed in common by these metals seems to require further explanation 10 At a bright red heat and in excess of air palladium asbestos causes oxida tion of all hydrocarbons as efficiently as does ignited oxide of copper 11 Glowiing of the palladium is by no means essenitial to slow oxidation where a mere carbon dioxide reaction for the recognition of the hydrocarbon gas ol vapor is to be attained that is when a quantitative combuistion is not aimed at 12 The proportion of finiely divided metal

uniiformly on the asbestos fibre the highber per centage by collecting irr eguLlarly is more liable to cause glowing Berliner Ann Phys CUien n F 35 p 791 states that the catalytic action of each metal in the case of the reaction IT2   H20 begins at a fixed temperature and increases with rise of temperature The oxidation temperature for platinum foil is abotut 2700 for copper 280 for zinc 350 while aluminitum has nio action at 4400 At constant temperatures the quantity of water formed is constant My experiments do not confirm these statements Krause and Meyer Ber 1891 p 698 R state that in the presence of mercury hydrogen begins to oxidize at 305 while increasing temperature accelerates the oxidation In contact with glass alone hydrogen burns between the limits 650 anid 7300 MIXTURES OF HYDROGEN WITH AIR AND HYDROCARBONS A great number of experiments have been unidertaken to ascertain the inlfluence of hydrogen upon the oxidationi of hydrocarbons in presence of metals Of these the following is a summary In a mixture of methane and air a small proportion of hydrogen does not influenice the oxidationi of the methane provided the rate of flow of the gas mixture over the palladium asbestos is very slow Water will form readily but no carbon dioxide unless the temperature rises to about the melting point of cadmium iodide 400 that is to say the temperature at which the methanie would be oxidized if no hydrogen were present If the gas mixture flows rapidly172 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES the burning hydrogen may so intensely heat the palladium as to cause it to glow This involves an immediate production of carbon dioxide With a slow movement of the gas considerable volurnes of hydrogen may be burned without formation of a trace of carbon dioxide This is the conclusion reached by Hempel but I have found tthe temperature at which the bydrocarbon is oxidized to be much higher thani he supposes abotut 2000 The same statement is trtue of hydrogeni and ethane and in general it may be said that the paraffins in presence of hydrogen and excess of air only undergo oxidation by palladium asbestos when the too rapid oxidation of the hydrogen causes glowing of the palladium The same general pheniomena are observed in the case of mixtures of olefines anid hydrogen with air The temperatures of oxidation of the olefines are always lower than those of the corresponding paraffins Below the temperature needed for oxidation a contractioln in volume often occurs due probably to occlusion by palla ditum The addition of hydrogfen to a mixture of air and carbon monioxide lowers the temperature of oxidation of the carboi monoxide by palladium asbestos While the car bon monoxide alone in air was oxidized at temper atures above 3000 in presence of hydrogen it may yield CO below 1000 As has already been stated the slow oxidation by palladium of a hydrocarbon in excess of air involves the conversion of carbon into carbon dioxide only no carbon monoxide beinig produiced Experiments were made with a gaseous mixture having the following composition Propane    31 Hydrogen    2 Air  949 Oxidation of the paraffin oceuLred at temperatures varying from 270 to the melting point of potassium nitr ate 3390 but in no case was any carbon monoxide produced nor could any olefines be detected in the gas after passing the palladium ACTION OF IIYDROCARBONS IUPON METALLIC OXIDES As the temperature of oxidationi by air in presence of finely divided metals seemed to vary within rather wide limits it was possible that the differences might be due to a lack of absolutely niiform conditions in the various trials So much care had beeni takeni as regards the temperature and preparation of metalcoated asbestos that there was nio positive ground for supposing that the apparatus and materials employed were in any way at fault To still fturther study the matter a series of trials was made of the temperature of reactiofn between redupcing gases

silver bichromate was uased The results are therefore similar to those obtained with palladium asbestos Barely visible traces of carboni dioxide were usually shown by the lime water in advance of the strong reaction which occurred later As in the case of oxidation by palladium in air the hydrocarbon appears to undergo a kind of smouldering which changes rather suddenly as the temperature rises to a condition of much more intense oxidation Hempel has suggested that it mighlt be possible by a process of selective oxida tion to remove consecutively tlie various constituients of a mixture of combustible gases and iu this way establish a metlhod of analysis The similarity in the proper ties of the various gases whose oxidatioui temperatures I have studied towards air and in presence of metals as well as towards silver bichromate seems to relnder doubtful the possibility of such a method From this statement is to be excepted the determination of hydrogen the methods for which have been so highly perfectecl by Hempel and Winkler A P SVOL XVII W174 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES II QUALITATIVE REACTIONS OF GASES The recognition of any gas in a complex mixture is still a matter of difficulty in maniy cases although in a few instances methods of identification are coming to be well known Serious difficulties oppose all attempts at a system of qualitative anial ysis of gas mixtures There are but few groups of gases if the name  group  be understood to incluide all gases chemically alike moreover the members of a group exhibit much closer relationships than are to be found among the metals of any one of the groups of Fresenius The following classification of gases has been found convenient for purposes of study Group 1 Hydrogen Group 2 Carbon monoxide

lower paraffins and olefines etc METHODS EMPLOYED In the case of reactions between gases and solid substances the solid to be tried was placed in a glass tube of oneeighthinclh diameter which could then be heated to any given temperature in the iron oven previously described while the gas was caused to stream through the tube In the case of reactions in solution two methods were used 1 The gas was caused to flow through a capillary tube into the solution con tained in a testglass The escapinig gas could then be led into a second and if necessary a third testglass in order to ascertain the action of the solutiont used in the first testglassRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 175 2 The gas was collected in glassstoppered bottles over water a stnall quantity of a solution introduced by meanis of a tap fuinnel with the lower end of its stem bent upward then the bottle closed and kept inverted at any given temperature for sufficient length of time usually from a few mouths to several days to ascertain if a reaction had occurred The for mer method answers well for gases which are easily controlled in a slow conitinuous stream and obtainable in large quantity The latter method is more economical as regards the gas to be used anid is better suited to gases where some slight but difficultly removable impurity is suispected to occur of a character liable to effect the r eagent such as the traces of hydrocarbons present in hydrogen made from zinc and sulphuric acid In such cases the smaller the volume of gas to be used in a trial the better A reaction may usually be obtained with from 20 to 50 cc of gas Small bottles having wellground flattopped glass stop pers answer well as they may be kept standing inverted and may if heat is to be applied be placed inverted in boiling water It is hardly necessary to add that when inverted stuch bottles may be used to hold gas in contact with a reagent for long periods without danger of loss HYDROGEN Hydrogen for

corroborating those of Pellet Silver nitrate containing a minute trace of fiee nlitric acid is not altered by hydrogen If some fieshly precipitated and washed silver oxide is digested witlh solution of silver nitrate andl the liquiid then filtered it will have an alkaline reaction towards litmuis and is slowly reduced by lhydrogen Boiling the solution with silver oxide increases its alkalinitv and also its senisitiveness towards hydrogen As a reagenit for the recognition of hydrogen it is better that the solution of silver nitrate should be slightly basic alkaline As regards the action of hydrogen upon ferric chloride it shouild be said that mere traces of ferrous chloride are produced as indicated by a faint change of color upon addition of potassium ferricyanide Free hydrogen has therefore a considerable reducing power for some of the more easily reducing metallic salts which is intensified in some cases by heating to 1000 It is convenienit to distinguish betweeni three classes of gas reactions as regards intensity Reactions of the first class in which a chanige is prompt and quanititative in its results e g when carbon dioxide is brought inlto contact with soda solution Reactionis of the second class in which a change is slow but no less complete ill a somewhat longer interval of time e g the reduction of platinum chloride solution by hydrogen Reactions of the third class in which a change is not recogniizable until after a considerable interval of time and the products appearing then are only found in traces such as the redaction of ferric chloride by hydrogen  Winkler Zeit Anal CJkem 1889 p 269RESEARCHES UPON TIHE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 177 None of the preceding reactions of hydrogen appear to fall under the first class Nearly all are of the second class That reactions such as I have called the third class should occur is diffiecLlt of explanation and it is questionable whether a parallel is to be foulnd in the case of ordinary reactions of metallic salts e g precipitation of traces of ferrous sulphide in ferrous chloride soltutionL by hydrooen sulphide or calcium oxalate by ammoniitum oxalate in dilute acid solution where a change in the proportion of free acid or alkali may cause the precipitation to become complete The reduction of ammoniacal silver soltution by hydrooen cannlot be materially accel erated by incr ease of ammonia

GASPS chloric acid The reaction begins and is completed without applicationi of external heat the temperature of the mass becoming very high as the above equation would indicate The production of hydrogeni chloride in this reaction renders palladium chloride a reagent of great sensitiveness for the recognition of free hydr ogreni in gas mixtures In order to study the reactioni more fiully it was necessary to prepare pure dry palladium chloride When a soluition of palladium in aquaregia is evapo rated to dryness brown amorphous cruists are formed which are very imperfectly soluble in water or hydrochloric acid Aualyses were made of the compound so obtained btut the results showed varying amounts of chlorine anid it was evident that the salt had been partially decomposed during the evaporation In order to obtain pure palladium chloride the following method of prepar ation was adopted Palladium dissolved in aquaaregia was heated for several days in a covered beaker over the water bath Hydrochloric acid was added fiom time to time to insure the destruction of any lower oxides of nitrogeni The solution was then evaporated to dryness and the residue heated to 1800 in a glass tube through which a current of dry hiydrogen chloride was passed The excess of hydrogen chloride was then expelled by a stream of carbon dioxide and after the escaping carbon dioxide was found to carry with it no more hydrogen chloride the compound was considered pure Hvdrogen was now passed through the tube and into standard soda solution The palladitum chloride was then reduced and the resulting hydrogen chloride absorbed by the soda The chlorine was determined voltumetrically Two analyses were made The restults showed the salt to consist of palladiurn dichloride Experiments undertaken for the puirpose of comparison of the properties of the two preparations demonstrated that palladium chloride prepared by the method above detailed is a much more sensitive reagent towards free hydrogen than the compouind obtained on merely evaporating to dryness a solution of palladium chlo ride on the water bath So delicate is the reaction that a neutral gas such as nitiro gen containing 120 of 1 per cent of free hydrogen will rapidly give an indication when passed over the palladium chloride and into a solution of silver nitrate It is absolutely necessary especially where traces of hydrogen are suspected that the gas should be dry as moisture is liable to condense with the hydrogen chlor ide in drops and thus the hydrogen chloride may be prevented from reaching the silver nitrate solution Ethylene reduces palladium chloride at temperatures above 1000 The double chloride of palladiurn and potassiuin PdCI2 2 KCI is reduced at about 3000 by ethylene The hydrocarbons of crude

original free hydrogen did not redtuce palladium chloride at 1000 Pure methane prepared by Gladstone and Tribes method exerted no action unitil heated nearly to 250 Palladium chloride heated in an inert gas such as carbon dioxide was found to yield chlorine at about 2500 In presence of oxygen the case is very different Pal ladium chloride heated in dry air loses chlorine readily at 160 being apparently converted into an oxychloride After longconitinued heating to 1000 in air chlorine in miniute traces is set free and recogniizable by silver nitrate conitaining some ferrous sulphate If air containinig any hydrocarbon paraffin olefene or acetylene be led over gently heated palladium chloride a decomposition occurs at once The palladium salt is reduced and hydrogen chloride is promptly set free Alcohol ether and ben zol vapor cause similar results Repeated trials have shown that less than 01 per cent of hydrogen in air may be recognized by the reaction above described if the temperature of the palladium chloride is not increased above 500 C If the tempera ture rises to 100 chlorine will be evolved from palladium chloride by the action of ait alone as may be easily shown by causing the air to bubble through silver nitrate solution containing a little ferrous sulphate free chlorine is not easily detected by silver nitrate alone and may bubble through it unabsorbed and unrecog nized The reduction of anhydrous ruthenium chloride by hydrogen is curiously influ enced by the presence of oxygen Ruthenium chloride was reduced by pure hydro gen at 190 In another experiment using a mixture of hydrogen 4 volumes and air 6 volumes no hydrochloric acid was produced even on heating to 320 The following is the most convenient method of applying the test The gas previously dried 1 by calcium chloride and 2 by phosphoric anihy dride is coniducted through a nlarrow tube to the bottom of a dry testtube contain ing about 02 gm of palladium chloride The testtube has a rubber cork with two holes Through a second tube the gas escapes and passes inito a solution of nitrate of silver The testtube may remain cold but in the absence of oxygen or air it is better to immerse in water at 40 or 500 provided no hydrocarbons likely to reduce palladium chloride are suspected The palladium chloride may be placed in a glass tube of oneeighthinch bore with asbestos plugs to prevent its becoming displaced by the gas stream and then the tube connected with the vessel containing silver nitrate solutiol If traces only of hydrogeni are to be tested for oxygen must be completely

sulphide and carbon dioxide gives in the main the reactions of hydrogen sulphide so that by the reagents usually employed for the detection of the latter gas these two sulphur compounds are not distinguishable In fact towards ammoniacal cadmium chloride solution silver nitrate and palladium chlo ride its reactions are characterized by somewhat greater promptness than in the case of hydrogen sulphide It is to be lnoted that shouild H2S and CSO occur in a gas mixture the OSO would by ordinary analytical methods be mistaken for H2S and equal volumes of the two gases would yield the same weight of Ag2S CdS CuS etc The principal metallic sulphides as usually formed by H2S could be in many cases more rapidly produced by CSO and so far as I have been able to observe the reactions there is little or no tendency to separation of free sulphur such as is common in precipitations by H2S The absorptioni of CSO in ammoniacal cadmium solution is so complete that on passing the gas through

after the removal of the hydrogen sulphide by this reagent used in a dry state the production of a precipitate in ammoniacal cadmium chloride solution would indi cate that this cadmium sulphide has been caused by carboni oxysulphide The presence of a little carbon monoxide in the CSO made from KCNS and sulphuric acid is liable to mislead in the reaction towards palladium chloride causing a black precipitate of palladium resembling the sulphide METHYL HYDROSULPHIDE CH3 SH This gas may be produced by several typical reactions 1 When methyl chloride bromide or iodide is heated with KSH in alcoholic solution the reaction being CH3CI  KSH KCI  CH3SH Methyl chloride gas was conducted into a boiling alcoholic solution of KSH contained in a tube of the shape here shown Thle lonlg limb of the tube length thii ty inlches was connected with a reversed200 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES condenser and was heated over a small flame The gas as it escaped was passed through a long glass tube containing cotton coated with red oxide of mercury which absorbs any possible traces of hydrogen suliphide and some of the mercaptan The gas was passed through broken ice As the reaction above mentioned is rather incomplete the gas contains much unaltered methyl chloride The same is true when the bromide and iodide are used Methyl chloride is the best suited to the purpose since it may be conducted into the liquid as a gas The iodide being a very volatile liquid is not easily added without danger of tumultuous boiling Formationi of difficultly soluble potassium chloride or iodide causes clogging and greatly interferes with the process even when large delivery tubes are used 2 Methyl sodium sulphate and potassium hydrosulphide on being brought together and warmed yield the following reaction NaCH3SO4  KHS  KNaSO4  CH3SH The reaction may be carried out in aqueous solution by the very excele4lt method of Klason Ber 1887 p 3407 Klason directs as follows 800 gm potassium hydroxide are dissolved in water the soltution is saturated by sulphuretted hydrogen It is placed in a large flask and sodium methyl sulphate made from 500 cc methyl alcohol added in small portionis On gently warming a mixture of the vapors of CH32S and CHI3SH is evolved The vapors are passed through an empty bottle and then into a second bottle containing soda solution which should be cooled The methyl hydrosulphide is completely absorbed by the soda forming NaCH3S The sodium mercaptide so produced is very stable Methyl sulphide condenses to a liquid which floats on the soda solutionl but does not combinie with the soda A separation is therefore easily effected The methyl sulphide may be driven off by warming the bottle containing the soda solution the CH3SNa being unaffected by the heat The methyl sulphide may thus be used in vapor form to produce its reactions After expulsion of the methyl sulphide the soda solution may be placed in a flask and decomposed by dilute sulphuric acid and CH3SH then expelled as a gas Some lead acetate is added to the solution in order to bind sul phuretted hydrogen during the decomposition of the sodium mercaptide by acid Kiason advises a further purification but by the process described the two sulphur compounds may be obtained of sufficient purity for the study of their reac tions Methyl hydrosulphide is a gas above

silver appeared slightly darkened in color CommentsTIn the remarkable diversity of its reactions methyl hydrosulphide probably excels every other known gas The stability of many of its metallic com pounds is often near ly as great as that of the coirresponding sulphides The reagents employed include many substances of high oxidizing power It was not possible however to detect in any case a trace of sulphuric acid Under the influence of oxidizing agents the tendency of the mercaptans is to produce oxygen compounds such as the sulphoinic acids CH3SH  03  CE13S03H Hence the failure to form sulphuric acid The following experiment illustrates the remarkable stability of methyl hydrosulphide The gas was passed in slow stream through a glass combustion tube containingRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 203 a fused mixture of sodium carbonate and potassiuLm bichromate but nio sodium sul phate was produced Moreover the gas escaping from the tube possessed the char acteristic odor of the mercaptan The same experiment was tried with a mixture of sodium carbonate and sodium nitrate with a similar result On accounit of its numerous reactions towards the various metallic salts a separation of methyl hydro sulphide and sulphuretted hydrogen is a difficult matter As it acts slowly and incompletely upon yellow mercuric oxide this substance may be used to absorb sul phuretted hydrogen Although methyl hydrosulphide attacks and combines with the mercuric oxide sulphuretted hydrogen gradually expels it the yellow color grad ually changing to black owing to the formationi of sulphide of mercury The yellow copper compound changes into copper sulphide The same is true of the yellow compounds of lead and silver and the white cadmium comnpound This change into sulphide is in every case promoted by exposure to air especially in presence of ammonia In an aqueous solution of methyl hydrosulphide containing neither acids nor alkalies the various compounds are more stable The mercaptides are easily produced in many cases by the action of a solution of the mercaptan in water upon the oxides hydroxides or carbonates of the metals and when so formed they are easily preserved unchanged It is of importance to note that sulphuretted hydrogen expels methyl hydrosul phide from many of its metallic compounds The reactions of CH3SH towards gold chloride anid arsenious chloride are especially remarkable In the former case the production of a precipitate gradually changing from yellow to white and finally dis appearing distinguishes this gas from sulphiuretted hydrogen The formation of an oily liquid insoluble in water in the case of arsenious chloride also serves to distin guish between the two gases METHYL SULPHIDE This compouind may be prepared by the action of methyl iodide or preferably methyl chloride upon potassium sulphide in alcoholic solution Gaseous methyl chloride may be led into an alcoliolic solution of potassium sulphide contained in a flask heated over a water bath and connected with a reversed condenser The vapor of methyl sulphide thus formed may be freed from sulphuretted hydrogen by oxide of mercury or by passage through warm soda solution In the process of Klason already described methyl sulphide is produced simul taneously with the hydrosulphide The process yields in fact a larger proportion of the former than of the latter It may be readily separated as already stated by means of soda solution which absorbs and combines with the mercaptan but exerts204 RESEARCHES UIPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES

methyl hydrosulphide In no case was a trace of sulphuiric acid produced although the gas was subjected to the action of manv very powerful oxi dizing agents The gold chloride reaction is similar to

evaporating the filtrate the methyl sulphide compound crystallizes in monoclinic prisms If sulphuretted hydrogen and methyl hydrosulphide are suspected to occur these two gases may be completely

401 Ferrous sulphate in an excess of alkaline citrate solution is unsatisfactory as ani absorbent for atmospheric oxygen on account of the extreme slowness of its action I have found that ferrous chloride mixed with thick milk of lime acts more rapidly for the reason that on agitating in a glass vessel the pastry mass coats the walls and better exposure of the precipitated ferrous hydrate to the air is effected The nitrogen used in the followinig experimnenits was prepared as described below Air was shaken with a mixture of pyrogallol and caustic soda solution The resulting impure

stable in dry air but yields magnesium hydrate and ammonia in presence of moisture So great is the affinity of magnesium for nitrogen that on burning in moist air the same compound results The oxide formed always contains ammonia as a decomposition product of this nitride Aslonoglow Chem NYews LXII p 99 The combination of nitrogen and magnesium could only prove of interest as a gas reaction in case the formation of the compound is not interfered with by the presence of such gases as are not readily removable from a mixture Sulphur and oxygen compoulnds would naturally be decomposed by magnesium In experimeents with natural gas as supplied to Allegheny in October 1892 it was found that magnesium heated to redness in a stream of the gas for onehalf hour yielded a strong odor anid the

produced in a precipitate of ferrous ferrocyanide or manganous hydroxide or in a solution of pyrogallol in soda or indigo solution previously bleached by zinc dust All of these substances absorb oxygen and at the same time undergo a change of color The most sensitive of these is the mix ture of pyiogallol and alkali A very senisitive reagent for free oxygen is found in precipitated manganous

dilute sulphturic acid before the reaction is tried No difficulty occurs in applying the same reaction in testinig a limited volume of gas Instead of conducting the gas in a stream through the solutions a eudiometer may be used The reaction is however far less satisfactory as the solutions are liable to hold atmospheric oxygen dissolved By means of a standard hyposulphite solution the free

NATURAL GAS The gas used in the following trials was that supplied to Allegheny by the Allegheny Heating Company and is the prodtuct of wells scattered over a consid erable gasproducing area It may be said to represent the average composition of an eniormous volume of gas No important differences have been observed during the period from 1886 to 1892 in the heatingof or illuminating power of the gas as supplied to the city except that the odor of petroleum i e of higher paraffins has been occasionally stronger Tests have also been made of gas fiom various localities in Pennsylvania New York and Indiana and Vancouver British America and also at Cleveland Q In all cases where possible the tests were made at the wells When this could nlot be done it was necessary to use samples brought in glass vessels to the laboratory In such cases the samples were examined for oxygen before being subjected to the tests As a leak in a sample vessel invariably causes an interchange of air and gas so that air enters in proportion as an escape of gas occurs much dependence is to be placed on the presence or absence of air in a gas sample as a criterion of its purity hIYDROGEN Hydrogen is almost always mentioned in the published analyses of natural gas I have made the following chemical tests The naturial gas as supplied to Allegheny by the Allegheny Heating Company was caused to flow through a solution of palla dium chloride for periods varying from ten days to three months Five hundred ctubic feet have been used in a single experiment Similar tests have been repeated at various times between January 18S6 and May 1892 but in no case was a trace of precipitation observed in the palladium ehloride solution Natural gas was found likewise to be without action upon solutions of platinum chloride and ammoniacal silver nitrate A stream of natural gas has been passed through dry paLre palladium chloride This extremely delicate test has failed to show the presence of hydrogen even in traces although tried repeatedly during the period from January 1886 unitil May 1892 As already stated the results of my study of gas reactions show that palladium chloride produces very differenit effects according as it is used dry or in solution Palladiutm chloride dry is reduced promptly by dry hydrogen when the gas is used in a free state216 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES The same salt in solution is slowly and incompletely reduced by hydrogen although it is rapidly reduced by olefines and carbon monoxide Similar tests with palladium chloride both dry and in solution made at the wells in the cases of all the localities mentioned in the table No I from 1 to 14 have led to similar results Natural gas from Vancouver and from Kokomo Ind could not be tested at the wells Tests made in the laboratory of the samples received from those localities gave the same negative results Another method of testing for hydrogen has been employed As is well kniown a jet of hydrogen is immediately ignited by platinum asbestos Natural gas under similar conditions is not igniited even when the gas jet and the platinum sponge are mounted in an oven kept at a temperature approaching 300 In order to ascertain the effects of different proportions of hydrogen and natural gas a gasometer con taininig the gas mixture to be tried was connected with a jet in form of a drawnout glass tube above which some platinum asbestos was fixed The gas pressure could be so regulated as to produce a pointed flame one inch long By momentarily shut ting off the gas by pinching the hose the flame could be extinguished and the gas being turned on again played against the platinum asbestos The length of the flame when the gas stream from the jet was ignited was therefore a measure of the gas flow The gas was ignited by the platinum asbestos or not according as the proportion of hydrogen in the natural gas was greater or less The ignition of the gas was also dependent uponl the temperature of the oven in which the jet and the platinum asbestos were fixed Mixtures of hydrogen and natural gas produced glowing of the platinum and igniition of the gas at the following temperatures when the experiment was made in a large iron oven whose temperature could be readily measured The gas pressure was the same in all trials PROPORTION OF HYDROGEN AND NATURAL GAS

etcRESEARCHES UPON TIIE CIHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 217 but trials with different pressures showed greater colnstancy than could be antici pated from a method so rough in appearance The results corroborate those obtained by the more delicate tests Experiments have also beeni tried with mix tuires of air and natural gas which were exposed to palladium asbestos contained in glass tubes heated in the iron oven described under Oxidation Temperatures of Hydrocarbons It has been repeatedly shown that under such conditions moisture is only produced at temperatures approaching or higher than the melting point of cadmium iodide The absence of free hydrogen has interfered with the use of natural gas in gas engines The prompt sharp explosion of coal gas so necessary for these motors cannot be produced in the case of natural gas which requires a higher temperature for its ignition and explodes with less suddenness owing to the absence of hydrogen The electrical devices for the igniting of coalgas jets in dwellings by the spark of an induction coil have not been so successful where natuiral gas is used owing to the higher temperature of ignition of a gas consisting of paraffins and containing no hydrogen In laboratories where natural gas is the fuel chemists have experienced the inconivenience that Bunsen burners and blast lamps do not produce the high tein perature easily obtained when coal gas is used Ordinary glass combustion tubing cannot be softened by the employment of natural gas in a Berzelius blast lamp A coalgas flame owes its steadiness and  stiffness  to the hydrogen which the gas contains Natur algas flames are much less steady and more easily extinguished by air currents During May 1892 a change occurred in the composition of the nattural gas supplied to Allegheny City The gas since that time and up to November 1892 has beeni fouind to contain hydrocarbons which reduce dry palladium chloride These hydrocarbons are removed completely by digestion with fuming sulphuric acid so that the gas after this treatment does not reduce palladium chloride The nature of these hydrocarbons I have been unable yet to determine OLEFINES Palladium chloride iridium chloride cerium dioxide in sulphuric acid osmic acid all remain unchanged by natural gas cold or at 100 Potassium permanga nate is attacked with extreme slowness Bromine water has been repeatedly tried The solution was in some cases cooled by ice to check evaporation of the brominie and in others the bromine was added slowly drop by drop to compensate for its evaporation In no case were any oily drops produced Prof Sadtler of Philadelphia has in one instance obtained a considerable amount of heavy oil by the action of bromine on natural gas218 RESEARCHES UPON TIIE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES My experiments seem to prove the absence of ethylene propylene isobutylene and trimethylene from the gas supplied to Allegheny The same is true of gas fiom the localities mentioned in the table from No 1 to 17 Tests could not be made at the wells in the case of gas from Kokomo Ind and Vancouver British Columbia but samples brought to the laboratory gave similar results The very low illumninating power of natural gas of Western Pennsylvania is a further evidence of the absence of olefines which as is well kniown are remarkable for the brilliancy of the light which they produce By the kindness of Mr J W Pattelrson gas inspector of Allegheniy county I am able to give the following data as to illuminatinig power The gas supplied to Pittsburgh by the mains of the Philadelphia Company November 30 1892 possessed an illuminating power equal to 10 84100 candles per five cubic feet of gas burnt per hour mean of ten determinations On the same date the illuminating power of the natural gas supplied by the Peoples Natural Gas and Pipeage Company was 10 77100 candles Mr Pattersons tests were made with a tlhirtysixhole Argand burnier havinig a chimtney seven inches lolng ACETYLENE AND ALLYLENE Palladium chloride solution is unchanged as already stated Cerium dioxide mercuric chloride gold chloride silver nitrate ammoniacal cuprous chloride and osmic acid are all unichanged Hence in the gas I have tested it may be said that no hydrocarbons of the acetylene series occurred I have found no reference to acetylenes in any published analyses to which I have had access CARBONIC OXIDE Carbonic oxide is nearly alwavs stated to occur in the ptublished analyses of natural gas In my experiments palladium chloride gold chloride silver niitrate in ammonia iridium chloride rhodium chloride osmic acid all used in solution were unchanged Experiments have been made with Allegheny City natural gas in the following way Gas has been caused to bubble for five weeks through ammolniacal cuprous chlor ide solution This solution was then largely diluted with watel and boiled The gases expelled were collected and tested by palladium chloride soltution but no car bon monoxide was found It is true that since the absorptioni of carbon monoxide in cuprous chloride has been shown to be a case of mechanical solution rather than chemical union1 and that the absorbed Co can be expelled by a stream of other gasesRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 219 the use of cuprous chloride for the absorption and recognition of carbon monoxide cannot be implicitly depended on Still the direct tests above named lead me to the conclusion that no carbon monoxide occurs in ouir natural gas PARAFFINS That the lower paraffins occur in natural gas needs no proof Methane is the chief constituent Small quantities of higher paraffins are usually present SULPHUR COMPOUNDS Pennsylvania natural gas does niot contain recogiiizable quantities of either COS CH3SH or CH32S Towards the western boundary of the State it is possible that minute traces of sulphuretted hydrogen occur The quantities of all such com pounds are far too small to allow of their being easily idenitified even in the case of large volumes of gas The extreme delicacy of the reaction of methyl mercaptan towards palladium chloride would render it possible to detect exceedingly minute quantities of this compound should it occur I have not had an opportunity to test the gas fiomn the Western Ohio territory which is said to contain sulphur compounds in considerable quantity NITROGEN Natural gas dried by calcium chloride and phosphorus peintoxide was passed over strongly heated magnesiuim powder The magnesium was partly converted into a nitride easily recognized by its reaction towards moisture yielding ammonia in coiisiderable amount Repeated trials have been made of natural gas ill the following way A measured volume of gas was passed over ignited oxide of copper contailled in a porcelain tube the entire apparatus havinig been previously filled with pure car bon dioxide which was caused to flow in a continuous stream for several hours in order to expel all traces of air The escaping gas was collected in a eudiometei over mercury and the carbon dioxide absorbed by soda There was left invariably a residue of gas unabsorbed by the soda and having lno actioln upon palladium chloride solution This residual gas was evidently nitrogen see Table of Analyses In the gas found in an artesian boring at Middlesborough England nitrogen was found in large proportion see Table of Analyses OXYGEN By the use of pyrogallol aiid soda and by the oxidation of mianganous hydrate in water I have freq1eut1y been able to detect traces of oxygen although on otheI220 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES occasions no oxygen could be found It has only been recognized when the gas had bubbled continuously for many hours or days through the reagent It cannot be said that oxygen is a constant conistituent although it does unquestioinablv occur in much of natural gas in minute traces CARBON DIOXIDE Carbon dioxide is present in all niatural gas as is easily proved by its action upon lime water AMMONIA In the case of a gas well near Canonsburg the following result was obtained Gas was caused to bubble directly from the main at the well through water for sev eral hours On applying Nestlers reagent to the water a feeble reaction was obtained Ammonia was not found elsewhere in the trials I have made Mr S A Ford of the EdgarThompson Steel Works reports a very interesting case where masses of solid ammonium carbonate were blown out from a gas well by the pressure of the gas Natural gas appears to consist chiefly of methane with traces of higher hydro carbons of the paraffin series Nitrogen is probably always present together with a little carbon dioxide The absence of free hydrogen of olefines and of carbon monoxide is I believe clearly shown in the case of the natural gas I have examined If natural gas as found in the wells of any one gas region is derived from one vast subterranean reservoir approximate uniiformity in composition should be looked for It is often noticed however that gas from adjacent wells possesses a different odor A carbon dioxide determination was made in the case of samples of gas fiom six wells near Tarentum Pa These wells were situated nearly on a straight line less than one mile in length The samples were all taken within an interval of three hours The determinations were made by a 7

It is niot possible to determine the proportion of the individuial paraffins in a gas mixture by the Bunsen method of explosion of oxygen unless it can be positively asserted that only two paraffins occur This may be readily shown by an example If a mixtuire of onie voltume each of marsh gas ethane and propane is burnt the vol umes of oxygen required carbon dioxide and steam produced will be as follows OXYGEN REQUIRED C02 i20 VAPOR 1 vol methane   2 vols 1 vol 2 vols 1  ethane 3   2  3 1  propane     5  3  4 10  6  9 2 Three volumes of ethane require for combustion ten and onehalf volumes of oxygen and yield six volumes CO2 and nine volumes of steam Hence a mixture of three gaseous paraffins could not be distinguished in the case of a volumetric anialysis from the intermediate paraffin Moreover the heat of combustion of three volumes of the intermediate paraffin is almost exactly equal to that of a mixture of one voltume each of the three From the fact last stated it follows tlhat as regards the calorific value of a mix ture of paraffins an exact determination of the character of the individual paraffins is not required A saving of timne the possibility of using a larger volume of gas the avoidance of a volutmetric determination of water vapor are some of the advantages gained by a combustion over copper oxide The application of gravimetric methods for the examination of gas is not new Winkler Hfandbook of Technical Gas Analysis p 87 has described such a process for the analysis of minle gas Description of MethodThe process employedl was with some slight modifica tions the same as described in the Annual Report of the Geological Survey of Pennsylvania for 1886 Glass cylinders having stopcocks at both ends accurately calibrated by mer cury anid of 30000 cc capacity were filled with natural gas Where possible this was done at the well Before filling with gas finely drawnout threads of glacial phosphoric acid were inserted through the stopcock into the vessel After twentyfour hours the gas sample could be considered dry Glacial phosphoric acid on softening in the flamae may be readily drawn out A P S VOL XVII 2 C222 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES like glass into rods of almost hairlike fineness The quanitity required was not suffi cient to cause error in the gas measurements inasmuch as the gas as it flows from the wells is in most instanices remarkably dry The cylinder was then connected with a porcelaini combustion tube C contain ing copper oxide The general arrangemenit of the apparatus is shown in the accom paniyingf sketch Befoie the commuLnication was made between the tube C and the glass cylin der A air was expelled from C by pture nitrogen dried in the tubes M The com bustion tube was intensely heated during the passage of the niitrogen After expulsion of air by nlitroge1l the naturi al gas was caulsed to flow over the copper oxide previously heated for some time The movemenit of the gas through the conmbustion tube was controlled by means of mercury which flowed from the funnel D into the gas cylinder and was so reoulated that two hours were required for complete combustion Experiments showed that there is no danger of production of carbon monoxide or unsatuirated hydrocarbons when the gas stream is slow After the gas had been expelled from the cylinder A it was rinsed by lowelring the mercuiry fuinnel so that niitrogen passed down into the cylinder to be again driven out by raising the funniel After the gas had been fully burnt air purified by the lower system of drying tubes in the sketch was passed thr ough the apparatus till the nitrogen and moisture had been fully displaced and the process was then complete the CO2 and 1120 being determined by weight The method as is seeni gives merely the proportions of car bon and hydrogen As the exact percentage of the paraffins in the gas mixture cannot be ascer tained by analysis an approximation alone is possible The composition by weight of some of the lower gaseous paraffins is as follows PARAFFINS CARBON HYDROGEN Methane  7497 per cent 2503 per cent Ethane  7996  2004  Propane  8178  1822 Butane  8272 1628 In

unit volume and from these the composition may be stated volumetrically in terms of ethane and methane by the use of the preceding table and with a fair approximation to the trulth It is probable that millUte quanitities of propane and perhaps higher paraffins occur but these cannot be identified The nitrogeni and carboni dioxide being deter minied the volume of CH4  C2H6  C3H8   is obtained as a difference The err or involved in such a method may then be exactly defined as follows The hydrocarbons may consist of methane with traces of propane or of methane with ethane or butane but the analysis will be stated volumetrically in terms of metlhane and ethane onily As regards the quiestion of fuel value I have endeavored to show see Report of Geol Survey of Penna for 1886 that the above method will give closely approx imate results wheni certain factors relating to available heat of combustion of par affins aie used The gravimetric method affords at the same time a means of control for it is not only true that in a given volume of a particular paraffin or of a mixture of paraffins the hydrogen and carbon will occur in definite quantity but the ratio H is a constant and will be greater as the proportion of higher to lower paraffins is greater These conisiderations will serve to show the limits of accuracy of the method Nitrogen was determined by passing a measured volunme 100 cc over ignited copper oxide contained in a porcelain tube and then inito a eudiometer containing soda solution By meanis of a stream of carbon dioxide continued for several hours the air was expelled from the apparatus previous to the combustion of the gas In presence of large excess of carbon dioxide combustion by copper oxide is greatly retarded and the process must be conducted very slowly to effect complete oxidation Oxygen as already stated oceurred in too small proportion to allow of a quan titative determination Carbon dioxide was determined by soda solution in a eudiometer over a mercury trough224 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES ViwfllLO3 C X iC 0   Oo O O I c d4 Ci   C 11x1L  o1LEfleOCo D C O 00 o1  o 0      P  JsIiW  C O I va4Hu ISH bb mi COC 0a

GASES 225 VII ORIGIN OF NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM Soon after the early discoveries of oil and gas in Pennsylvania the geologists proposed a hypothesis to account for the or igin of these remarkable substances Remains of the marine vegetation of the Devonian inlanid sea as they were grad ually buried under the later accumulations of sediment and exposed to gentle heat from below underwent a slow process of destructive distillation In this way all the varieties of petroleum and natural gas were produced This view adopted from a purely geological standpoint seemed so plausible that for a lonig period no other was thought of Mr J F Carl of the Second Geological Survey of Pennsylvania has discussed the hypothesis very exhaustively in his various official reports If this view is correct oil and gas are probably stored produtcts and are not being con tinuously generated at the present time Opposed to this view is the more strictly chemical hypothesis of Mendeleeff who in 1876 expressed his belief that petroleum and gas are of igneous origin On account of the high value assigned by astronomers for the mean density of the earth as compared with that of the suiface rocks it follows that the heavy metals are mnainly accumulated at great depths where a temperature of fusion may be as sumed Many of these metals combine readily with carbon to form carbides Iron in form of a carbide wlhen exposed to steam at high temperatures is rapidly oxidized the hydrogen of the water then combining with the carbon set free and producing hydrocarbons Citinig experiments of Cloez who produced mixtures of hydrocarbon oils by the action of hydrochlor ic acid upon ferromanganese Mendeleeff concluded that such reactions have occurred at great depths below the earths surface by the contact of steam with incandescent metallic carbides During the upheaval of mountain ranges crevices would be formed at the peaks with openings utpward and at the foot of the mountains with openings down ward Thus there was opportunity for the water to penetrate to great depths and for the hydrocarbons to escape The situation of naphtha at the foot of mounitain chains is the chief argument in my hypothesis Mendeleeff Principles of Chemistry Fol I p 365 According to this view oil and gas are being conttnuously generated for there is no reason to suppose that the masses of metallic carbides in the earths initerior are exhausted such in fact seems to be Mendel6effs view226 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES Mendele6eff points especially to the absence of large quantities of nitrogen com pounds in petroleum as an argument in favor of the hypothesis The objection has beeni urged against this hypothesis that petroleum if thus produced should be abundanit in the primary rocks from which it is usually absent The originally heated conditioni of these rocks would have prevelnted the condensa tion of oil however and although the vapors may have passed through the earlier rocks there is nlo reason to expect that condensation slhould have occurred before reaching much higher strata While on geological grounds difficult to prove or disprove it meets with one fatal objection The composition of natural gas in Peninsylvania does not justify the sup position that superheated steam and carbon have been concerned in its formation We slhould certainly look in such a case to find natural gas composed mainly of fiee hydrogen containing small quantities of paraffins olefines and carbon monoxide When it is considered that paraffins alone cannot under anly known circumstances be produced from the oxidation of carbide of iron by steam the hypothesis does not seem to be tenable It is true thiat varying conditions of temperature might have produced a great variety of hydrocarbons but no evidence has yet been obtained that paraffins alone result fiom such a reaction In an experiment made with ferromanganese and dilute sulphuric acid the gas evolved was found to contain 6 per cent of olefines It is further to be noticed that this hypothesis requires that water should take part in the process yielding up its hydrogen while according to the older geological hypothesis the water may have served mainlv to cover and give protection from atmospheric oxidation if it has been concerned at all in the reaction Water contains dissolved oxygen and in descending to the iron carbides must have given off its dissolved oxygen long before reaching the region at which actual formation of hydrocarbons could oceur Hence on this hypotlhesis oxygen should be found in natural gas in larger quantity than the chemical tests indicate In fact in rocks of moderately high conducting power a wide interval would exist between the depth at which water boils and the much greater depth at which water vapor could oxidize metallic iron in quantity It is doubtful whether water could have traversed this interval so as to reach the latter depth at all Engler Ber Vol XXI p 1816 and Vol XXII p 592 has published the results of interesting investigations upon the distillation prodtucts of menhaden fish oil By conducting the distillation at a high pressure 25 atmospheres this author produced a mixture of hydrocarbon oils from which a large number of normal  Experiments by F C PRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 227 paraffins was obtained compounds not found elsewhere in nature than in pe troleum This has led to the revival of an older theory as to the origin of petroleum and gas i e that they have resulted from the distillation under pressure and at low tem peratures of the accumulated remains of marine life buried under the sediments of the ancient Devonian seas Much has been written in support of the hypothesis of Engler and it may be said to have gained very general acceptance in Europe Ochseinius Chem Zeitung 1891 p 936 has summarized many of the argu menits usually adduiced in support of the hypothesis This author says  Concerning the origin of petroleum there is now no doubt that with a few exceptions animal remains mainly of marine life have yielded the raw material Originally the opiniion was held thiat it was derived from vegetable matters be cause the accumulation of animal remains sufficient to account for its formation by any distillation process in the rocks could not be explained Distillation of vege table matters would however have left greater deposits of coal as a residue in the Devoinian rocks But petroleum occurs in rocks of marine formation where coal is uncommon Rocks in which plant remainis are found do nlot conitain bitumeni petro leum If animal remains are associated with those of plants then bitumen is usu ally found The objection urged against the hpothesis of Engler that nitrogen does not occur in petroleum is easily overcome by the fact that nitrogeni of animal tissues tends finally to produce ammonia and this in the case of petroleum may have been carried away in solution by water hence the absence of nitrogeni compounds From Englers experiments it appears that animal fats are the chief source of petroleum It is true that fatty matters do not ordinarily sink in water although Von Guembel in the voyage of the Gazelle found fat globules in dredgings from the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean in water 15000 feet deep Putrefactive changes would tend to yield considerable quantities of ammonia and carbon dioxide These in presence of salt water would produce alkali bicarboni ate and ammonium chloride Hence alkaline waters might be looked for in the neighborhood of petroleum The petroleum at Pcchelbroiin is associated with water containing 05 per cent of alkaline carbonate In Western Pennsylvania many cases are known of water having a decided alkaline reaction in the neighborhood of gas wells In the Murrysville gas territory water of alkaline reaction was so abun228 RESEARCHES UPOS THE CHElMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES dant as to seriously interfere with gas development Note by F C P Such alkaline waters are not known in archaean rocks and are not therefore likely to be derived from greater depths thani the rocks in which they are found Probably no cases can be cited where fatty tissues alonie of buried animals have yielded oil or gas The presenice of strongly saline water is apparently needed Great diffierences occur in the cbemical clharacter of petroleum Caucasian oils are mainly composed of olefines or substances related to the olefine group The German oils are mixtures of paraffins and olefines while the American are chiefly parafflins Such differences may be attributed to the character of the rock in which the distillation has occurred Sandstones wotuld probably prove without action while limestones by reason of their basic character would tend to strongly influence the products Such are some of the arguments of Ochsenius in favor of Englers hypothesis If this view is accepted it follows that the generation of petroleum and gas must be considered as a finished process so far as all existinig productive gas and oil regions are conicerned Engler has analyzed the gas evolved when 1 menhaden oil and 2 when oleic acid are

niormal paraflins and their isomers 100 parts of menhaden oil yielded 89 parts of gas and 63 parts of liquid oils A strong argument in support of the Engler hypothesis is found in the fact that by distillation of fish oils besides methane several of the lower paraffins are pro duced in large quantity Hydrocarbonis of the paraffin series are not obtainable in such proportions by the distillation at high temperatures of other organic material under ordinary conditions It should be noted as a fact of much interest as regards the results of Englers researches that in the distillation at higher pressures the proportion of olefines con tained in the gases evolved is considerably less This is also true of carbon moniox ide when oleic acid was distilled It is to be regretted that Englers experimentsRESEARCHES UPON THE CHIEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES 229 were not repeated at still higher pressures in order to ascertain whether these same constituents of the evolved gases diminish progressively with increased pressure Engler was the first to show clearly that the problem of the origin of oil and gas must be studied from the chemical rather than the geological standpoint The hypothesis advanced by this author has been very generally accepted Nevertheless my examinations of natLural gas have led me to douibt some of his conclusions well founded as they seem The most careful tests carried oni during a period of six years have failed to show the presence of either olefines or carbon monoxide in the natural gas of Western Pennsvlvania Some of the constituenits of gas are soluble in water This is notably the case with carboni dioxide butane hexane etc If ethylene and carbon monoxide have been produced even in much smaller proportion in the rocks than Engler finds in menhaden oil gas these substanices would niow occur in the natural gas of Pennsyl vania Ethylene would give to the gas such illuminating power that there would be no occasioni for the use of coal gas in anly town in the Western Pennsylvania gas region As a matter of fact natuLal gas is almost useless as an illuminiant its light being equal to 5 to 11 candles per five feet of gas consumed per hour Mr Robert McKinney formerly gas inspector of Allegheny county found as a mean of forty trials of natural gas supplied to Pittsburgh an illuminating power of 65 candles Mr J W Patterson the presenit gas inispector of the county states that the illumiiinating powel of natural gas as suipplied to Pittsbturgh in November 1892 is a little less than 11 candles per five feet per hour The reason for this is that natural gas as found in Pennsylvania does not conitain olefines If car bon monoxide occurr ed in gas there would have been innumerable cases of poisoning among workmen at gas wells It is common to find such leaks of gas about the majority of gas wells that no one could strike fire at a well without risk of fatal consequences Although inhaling the escaping gas for much of a lifetime a gaswell driller will usually maintain that DO bad effects to health come from exposure to the gas Air containing 02 per cent of CO is known to produce dangerous effects upon health According to Wyss Zeit Ang Chem 1888 p 465 air conitaining 01 per cent of water gas is poisonous to breathe It is hardly probable moreover that CO or C2H4 occurring in gas could have been absorbed or removed at low temperatures by any natural process in the rocks Unlike carbon dioxide and ammonia their slight solubility in water would preclude the supposition that they had been dissolved away Muck

nitrogen by causing the water to dissolve carboniate of lime etc Gentle heat fiom below would tend still further to the expulsion of the nitrogen anid thus a consider able but limited quanitity of nitrogen might be obtained as a sudden outburst from a diill hole It may be said that varying conditionis of temperature anid pressure and kind of rock have modified the products so that perhaps the carbon monoxide and ethylenie resulting from a laboratory experiment have in natures workshop given place to paraffins But if the chemistry of the reaction supposed to occur is to be considered at all the fact that distillation experiments have produced fiom fish oil certain bodies found in nattural gas paraffins should not count more forcibly as geological evi dence than the other fact that such distillation yields bodies which are foreign to natural gas as usually found in Pennsylvania I have failed to find any data tending to show that organic matter can be sub jected to destructive distillation in such a manner as niot to yield carbon monoxide and considerable quantities of olefines together with hydrocar bons of still less sat urated character As a iule the acetylenes and beiizol series appear Englers hypothesis involves the suppositioni that a process of distillation has occurred at moderately high temperatures and at pressures rmeasured by great depth of rock strata The carbon dioxide evolved in this destructive distillation must have come continuously into contact with the vast quantities of carbon which in its various stages of transformationi from vegetable tissue to anthracite is so widely distributed throughouit the rocks The reaction 0O2  C  2 0o wlhich proceeds iapidly at a strong heat and also slowly at lower temperatuires would then probably have oc curred wherever the temperature was sufficiently high Prolonged contact of carbon dioxide with the carbonaceous residue of the dis tillation would perhaps be sufficient to increase considerably the final yield of carbon monioxide According to I L Bell Chemical Principles of the Manufacture of Iron and Steel p 101 the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide by carbon in the form of soft coke begins at 4270 0 This is about the temperature at which Englers distillation experiments were colnducted 360420 C Engler has shown that distillation of animnal fats at very high pressure 25 at mospheres may yield gas containing less of carbon monoxide and olefines than whlen the process is conducted under atmospheric praessure No data are at hand as232 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES to results at still higher pressure If it is conceded that the proportion of carbon monoxide and ethylene in the gas evolved during destructive distillation decreases progressively with inicrease of pressure and that these two constituents vanish alto gether at sufficiently high pressures it would still seem necessary to suppose that the pressure must have been at least twice as great when the process occurred in the rocks as in the case of Englers experiments Takinlg the specific gravity of the rocks to be about 2 it mav be assumed that twelve feet of rock strata represent a pressure of 1 atmosphere six hundred feet of solid rock would then be required to produce a pressure of 50 atmospheres This would be considerably less than the depth of the same quantity of rock material in the form of loose sediment before its consolidation No case can be cited in recent times where sediment six hundred feet deep has been so suddenly accumulated as to bury unchanged the vast quantities of animal remains necessary to account for the productioni of oil and gas upon Einglers hypothesis that oil and gas have resulted from the action of pressure and moderate heat upon animal matters There is probably no reason to suppose that the gaseous olefines have under the influence of pressure given place to others of higher boiling point by a process of polymerization Should the possibility of suchi a change be proved the absence of olefines fiom natural gas and their presence in petroleum might be explained The possibility of secondary reactions among the constituents of a complex gas mixture at high temperatures alnd under pressure adds difficulty to tlle problem anld caution is needed to avoid the error of overestimating the importance of any given reaction It is generally true however that under such conditions secondary changes are probable and that unsaturated compoundsolefines acetylenes carbon monoxide are likely to result especially when water vapor and carbon dioxide are present It is a wellknown fact that when petroleum is distilled considerable quiantities of unsaturated hydrocarbons are produced which did not exist in the original crude oil This is shown by the bromine absorption of the different products The pro cess of  cracking or brealiing up by heat of the hydrocarbons in petroleum into simpler and less saturated compounds is familiar to all oil refiners Chemically speaking cracking means the production of unsaturated hydrocarbons The fact that Engler has in his extremely interesting anid importanit researches produced by distillation of animal matters so great a variety of parafflins constitutes by far the strongest arguimenit in favor of his hypothesis Sorge in an article which has been reproduced in ilumerous joturnals J Ch Soc 1888 p 31 abstract has stated that a strong resemblailce exists between Pennsylvania natural gas and gas manulfactured from Westphalian coal SimilarityRESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES

analysis of gas from Westphalian coal carried out in the lab oratory of the Westphaliarn Berggewerkschaftskasse in Bochum will be of interest I am indebted to Mr Bergassessor E Krabler of Bochum for

considerable quantity as to render it probable that this gas is set fiee in the process of decay The same apparatus was kept in position for two and a half years after the above experimenits Were

examined the gases produced in swampy grounld in many different places Samples were taken fiom streams havinig muddy bottoms aiid in which vegetable matter hiad collected Samples of gas have also been taken from salt marshes on the coast of Maine Gas has also been collected from the very deep accumulationis of mud and decaying vegetable remains found in some parts of Lake Chautauqua The general result of examinations of these gas samples may be stated to the effect that the gas occurriing in shallow swamps and streams conisists of methane carbon dioxide and nitrogen In some of the much deeper swamp waters where masses of vegetable debbris of greater thickniess are found as in Lake Chautauqua hydrogen occurs in very small quantity Great difficulty is experienced in takinig samples of gas from localities of the latter type Tappeiner observes that the marshgas fer mentation is very probably a very important source of methane in nature The fact that buried vegetable matters may after a brief period of rapid gas evolution pass into a condition of extremely slow decay adds greater force to the original theory of petroleum and gas The occurrence of so large a proportion of fiee hydrogen among the gases evolved by vegetation in process of decay is a matter of great interest as it suggests the existence of an important source of hydrogeni wlherever deeply submerged plant remains occur Frankland J Ch Soc 1883 p 295 found that grass left to decay under water air beinig excluded evolved gas in three days of the following composition Carbon dioxide  8463 per cent Oxygen

continued process of decay After the first decomposition such remains might become accumulated anid buried deeply under sediments before the tissues are materially altered The generation of gas might then proceed in the cold It seems hardly possible to ignore this probable source of natural gas in discussing any theory as to its origin espe236 RESEARCHES UPON THE CHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF GASES cially wheni it is considered that no other process in nature has been found to vield a gas at all similar in compositioni to that found in the rocks Of the three hypotheses which have been proposed to account for the production of oil and gas two are open to a serious objection The chemical changes stupposed by Engler to have been the cause would prob ably yield gas diffeirent in composition from the natural gas now being obtained in such large quantity in Western Pennsylvania and if the gas originally contained ethylene and carbon monioxide it is not easy to explain their complete disappearance in the niattural gas I have examined fiom wells scattered over so large a region The hypothesis of Meiideleeff would be much more difficult to reconcile with the facts as regards composition The total absence of hydrogen couild not be easily explained The only process in nature which is kiniown to yield gas similar in its constituents to natural gas is that which occurs in swamps and decaying masses of submerged vegetable remains The important fact that the solid plant tissues may be preserved for long periods after the preliminaryr gas evoluition has ceased shows that the remains are likely to become slowly buried to undergo the fermentatioil changes leading to the productiotn of methane Animal tissues can suffer no such airest of decomposition Decay once set in is carrlied rapidly onward to complete destruction withouLt intermission The con trast between the conditions in which animal and planit remains occur in the rocks seems to justify this statement If chemical evidence shall cotunt in the discussion it is difficult to find a more satisfactory explaniation than the older hypotheses which the geologists advanced although in their treatment of the subject the strictly chemical arguments were neglected

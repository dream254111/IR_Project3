papers to be presented at this meeting today it was stated that the intention was to get at the fundamental things in enzyme activity Since the chemical nature of an enzyme is as fundamental for the understanding of an enzyme action as any other factor I shall present some results obtained during the last six years bearing on this question2 It will not be necessary to give a definition of enzymes here or to present a classifica tion of enzyme actions This has been done repeatedly and it would appear that at pres ent nothing essential can be added in this re spect The question will be taken up as a chemical problem Certain definite chem ical changes may be accelerated under defi nite conditions certain products obtained from living organisms have the property of accelerating these changes these accelera tions can be controlled within limits by altering the conditions The problem in its simplest terms is the study of the chemical nature of these products of animal or plant origin which accelerate the changes At the same time influences physical in nature such as the solvent and the colloidal prop erties of the materials must not be lost sight of as they undoubtedly play a part in modifying the velocities of the reactions 1 Presented at the meeting on Enzymes and their Behavior before the Division of Biological Chemistry American Chemical Society Boston September 12 1917 2 The

their actions by increasing the velocities of chemical reac tions a large amount of work has been done in studying the kinetics of such reac tions The actual results obtained from such studies in so far as light has been thrown on the chemical nature of enzymes has been disappointingly meager In fact the results which might be expected from such studies have been in large measure unsatisfactory This may be shown by a brief survey of some of the work on the kinetics of invertase action to which from this point of view more attention has been paid than to any other enzyme action In vertase as is well known hydrolyzes cane pugar to form glucose and levulose O Sul livan and Tompson3 in 1890 as a result of the study of the kinetics of this reaction concluded that the reaction was of the first order the velocity being proportional to the concentration of the cane sugar Duclaux4 in 1898 Brown5 and also Henri6 in 1902 found that the velocity of this re action was not of the first order as shown by the lack of constancy of the velocity co efficients Henri7 suggested in 1905 that because of the colloidal nature of enzymes the reaction belongs to a twophase system to which the simple mass law is not appli cable in the given manner Hudson8 in 1908 as a result of some new work in which the mutarotation of the invert sugar was taken into account found that the hydrol ysis of cane sugar in the presence of in vertase gave velocity coefficients that were constant when calculated by the unimolecu 3 O Sullivan and Tompson J Chem Soc 57 834 1890 4 Duclaux Ann Inst Pasteur 12 96 1898 5 Brown

OSullivan and Tompson Michaelis and Menton9 in 1913 disagreed with Hudson in attempting to express the velocity of the reaction as a simple logarithmic function of the sugar concentration and elaborated the view of Henri of the twophase system and forma tion of an intermediate compound Bay lissl in 1911 developed the view of such intermediate compounds as adsorption compounds and concluded that the rate of enzyme action was a function of the amount of adsorption compound in exist ence at any particular time Nelson and Griffin1 in 1916 developed the twophase system view of invertase action and in 1917 as a result of an extended series of ex periments Nelson and Vosburgh2 sum marized and stated clearly the present status of the problem of the kinetics of in vertase action Their conclusions may be stated briefly as follows I The velocity of inversion is directly proportional to the concentration of the in vertase II The velocity is nearly independent of the concentration of the cane sugar in the more concentrated sugar solutions while in very dilute sugar solutions the ve locity increases with increase in concentra tion of the substrate and finally reaches a maximum III The results obtained agree with the heterogeneous reaction view and contradict the claim that the kinetics of invertase ac tion conform to the unimolecular law for homogeneous reactions Michaelis and

Adsorption is one of the controlling factors in the kinetics of invertase action and the velocity of inversion curve has the same general shape as adsorption curves as suggested by Henri This brief review will show the uncer tainty of the conclusions from the results obtained in the study of the kinetics of one of the most carefully measured of enzyme actions TIhe factors controlling the veloc ity of this reaction are just beginning to be cleared up the simple earlier views being incomplete An unsuccessful attempt to formulate the kinetics of enzyme action in a compara tively simple way may be mentioned The hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbon dioxide was used by D D van Slyke1 to develop a general theory of the kinetics of such enzyme actions based upon the assumption of an intermediate com pound between enzyme and substrate Un fortunately in the development of the equations a further assumption was intro duced which limits their validity rand appli cability to definite conditions which are realized only in special cases14 The study of the kinetics of enzyme ac tion has not therefore led to any results with regard to the chemical nature of enzymes even in the simplest eases of chem ical changes Practically all enzymes are colloids and when the substrate also is a colloid as in the action of a protease on a protein it is obvious that the conditions are complicated to such an extent that a quan titative study of the kinetics of such a re action appears to be almost hopeless al though valuable qualitative results may be obtained The study of the chemical nature of enzymes is complicated in most eases by 1s D D Van Slyke and G E Cullen J Biol Chem 19 146 1914 14 J Biol Chem 28 389 1917  reason of the complexity of the substances whose changes they accelerate This diffi culty can be obviated for a few of the enzymes For extample the lipases and esterases accelerate the hydrolysis of fats and esters While the mechanism of the hydrolysis of an ester to form acid and al cohol in the absence of lipase is not known definitely still the compositions and prop erties of the initial and final products undergoing the enzymatic change are known This eliminates partly at any rate one of the unknown factors of the enzyme problem and is the main reason for studying lipagse in connection with the question of the chemical nature of the ac tive catalyst the enzyme Practioally all enzymes are colloids or are intimately associated with substances having colloidal properties Furthermore in a large number of cases it seems that the enzyme is associated with protein matter either as an essential part of the protein molecule or accompanying it in such a way that separation has note yet been effected Among the enzymes which chemically show the characteristics of proteins may be men tioned the amylase obtained by Sherman15 proteases and lipases On the other hand the invertase described by Nelson is a carbohydrate phosphoric acid complex con taining about one per cent of nitrogen in the form of protein These facts make it evident that for the case of lipase to use a specific example the isolation of the enzyme in a pure state is a phase or part of the problem of the isola tion of a pure protein since in the separa tion of the active lipase from inactive ma terial present with it the resulting bodies approach more and more nearly in proper 15 Sherman and coworkers J Am Chem Soc 19121917 16 Nelson and Born J Am Chem Soc 36 393 1914 425 MAY 3 1918N S VOL XLVII No 1218 ties and composition those which are gen erally taken to typify proteins In the problem of isolating pure proteins it has been possible by careful treatment to ob tain bodies having the same properties at different times This is somewhat different from obtaining a pure protein possessing the same properties as when present in liv ing matter The operations involved in such isolations are always sufficient to change the properties of the protein to somme extent The problem of isolating a pure lipase for example must wait there fore for the solution of the problem of the isolation of proteins possessing the proper ties which they exhibit in living matter using the term living to include also mat ter showing the actions of enzymes If therefore there is little hope at pres ent of isolating a pure enzyme consider ing also the colloidal nature of the mate rial with which it is necessary to work there is a possibility of attacking the prob lem in a somewhat different way An enzyme as a rule accelerates a more or less specific reaction or group of reactions Considering the very complex nature of the protein or other molecule which in cludes the enzyme or with which the enzyme may be associated and the more or less specific reaction which it accelerates it would appear as if some definite group ing in the complex enzyme molecule were responsible for a given enzyme action Al though this is an assumption there is con siderable ground for making it consider ing the views held at present with regard to the probable mechanism of the reaction of ester hydrolysis and the complex na ture of the protein enzyme molecule com pared with the comparatively simple ester acid alcohol molecules involved in the catalyzed reaction At any rate this is the view upon which the work on the chem ical nature of enzymes was based namely that part of the complex molecular group ing of the protein material is responsible for a given action The problem therefore re solves itself into a study of the chemical nature of this grouping The colloidal properties of the protein and other molecules as a whole also influ ence the rates of reaction especially with insoluble fats in the case of lipase for ex ample Emulsifying agents also play a part but it appears from the experimental evidence available that such agents do not cause enzyme action in the absence of a definite enzyme grouping while on the other hand enzyme action occurs even without the emulsifying or other agent though perhaps not to as great extent as in their presence The main factor therefore may be taken to be the chemical grouping the physical and other properties modifying to a greater or less extent the typical action of the active enzyme grouping though not changing its nature The point of view has been presented from which the study of the chemical na ture of enzymes was developed As stated before the experimental work was done for the most part with lipase because of the bet ter known properties of the substrate and its reaction products The greater part of the lipase work was carried out with prep arations from castor beans although other sources were also used There has been a general tendency in the study of enzyme actions to attempt to attain conditions under which the enzyme would show a maximum action This method of study ing the problem is likely to introduce a number of new complicating factors so that it was considered that if the aotion was due to some definite grouping a study of the factors which caused a loss of the action SCIENCE 426SCIENCE might aid in throwing light on the nature of the grouping A systematic study of the factors which caused inactivation of the esterase and lipase was therefore under taken The results were presented in de tail elsewhere  Inactivation of the lipase and esterase preparations was brought about by acids bases neutral salts alcohols acetone esters and heat The different ways in which these prep arations may be inactivated make it appear at first sight as if different reactions occur in the inactivations If however a defi nite chemical group is responsible for a definite enzyme action it might perhaps be more reasonable to assume that inactiva tion follows a definite reaction The prepa rations used were essentially protein in character There was no evidence that a dehydration or loss of the elements of water caused inaetivation Some of the reactions indicated that a possible hydrol ysis might be a cause of inactivation With proteins hydrolysis is generally taken to occur with the CONH group the peptide linking which goes over into the carboxyl and amino groups Ex periments with all the inactivations in no case showed an increase in the formol titra tion such as would be expected in this re action and therefore makes the assump tion of such a hydrolysis improbable Co agulation of the material accompanied some of the inactivations This physical change alone does not appear satisfactory as an explanation some change in chem ical structure unquestionably muist accom pany or produce the physical phenomenon Furthermore the lipase material in sus pension in water showed the same activity as in 15 normal sodium chloride solution when tested immediately The explanations of the chemical changes accompanying inactivation so far suggested are not satisfactory The reagents used are simple It is difficult to conceive of a very deepseated chemical reaction taking place under so many differenrt conditions none of a complex nature The only chem ical change which appears probable under these conditions is that involving a simple rearrangement within the molecule such as a tautomeric change involving the change in position of a hydrogen atom In considering the structure of proteins it is evident that such a rearrangement is possible in the peptide linking The hypothesis to be suggested is that the active grouping of the esterase and lipase preparations is of the enollactim structure C OH N the specifici ties being dependent in part upon the groups combined with the carbon and ni trogen and that inactivation consists pri marily in a rearrangement to the keto lactam group CONH This hypothesis was tested in several dif ferent ways It has been found that in tau tomeric substances the presence of alkali in solution favors the enol form of com pounds showing such tautomerism while acid favors the existence of the keto form The hydrolytic actions of some simple dipeptides on esters at different hydrogen ion concentrations would therefore be evi dence bearing on this point the alkaline solutions presumably favoring the enol lactim structure In order to find the ac tions exerted by the aminocarboxyl groups of the peptide the hydrolytic actions of a number of amino acids on different esters were determined at the same hydrogenion concentrations The actions of the dipep tides and amino acids were also measured with the aminocarboxyl groups actions masked by the hydrogen of the carboxyl group being replaced by the ethyl group 427 MAY 3 1918N S VOL XLVII No 1218 and also by teiting compounds such as hippuric acids which do not contain an amino group In these compounds it is possible that the equilibrium between the ketolactam enollactim forms might be changed rap idly if the conditions were changed slightly A more stable substance was therefore studied from this point of view Imido esters as shown by the formula a pos sess the enollactim structure in which the hydrogen atoms may be substituted by or ganic radicals The hydrolytic actions on esters of ethyl imidobenzoate b at differ ent hydrogenion concentrations and vari ous conditions were measured R COR  NR a cOH Co00H  NH b Finally in order to reproduce the condi tions and properties of naturally occurring lipases as far as possible a number of dif ferent proteins were treated with alkali for the purpose of producing an enollactim grouping in the peptide linking if this were possible then neutralized to different hy drogenion concentrations and the hydro lytic actions tested on a number of differ ent esters As the data obtained have been presented in detail in the papers referred to they will not be repeated here It may be stated that the assumption with regard to the ac tive grouping has been borne out by the experimental facts with the different series of compounds Especially interesting are the ester hydrolyzing substances obtained by the action of alkali on a number of pro teins7 It must be emphasized that no direct conclusive evidence is presented as to the actual chemical configuration of the active 17 F H Frankel J Biol Chem December 1917 lipase grouping The steps in the reason ing may be summarized as follows Inactivation and therefore also activa tion is assumed to be due to a tautomerie rearrangement whose possible nature is in dicated Simple substances possessing such structures show the actions and some other properties of naturally occurring lipases present in protein materials Inac tive proteins treated in such a way as to produce the supposedly active grouping phow esterhydrolyzing properties Whether it is possible to go much beyond this in the present state of the knowledge of the chemical nature of proteins and the changes they undergo with simple treat sment is an open question However one possible line of development bearing di rectly upon the present problem may be indicated The equilibrium in solution between the tautomeric forms of acetoaeetic ester and also of other substances depends to a great extent upon the solvent18 This suggests that with the enollactim ketolactam tau tomerism in proteins the colloidal proper ties of the protein material may well exert an influence on the grouping comparable to the effects of the solvent on the tautomer ism of acetoacetic ester just mentioned The decreased stabilities or increased rates of inactivation of enzyme preparations wrhen separated to a greater or less extent from colloidal and other matter not con nected with the actions may then parallel the actions of the solvents on the equi libria between the tautomeric forms of aeetoacetic ester In the development of the hypothesis re garding the active grouping in lipase ac tions the experimental work and discus sion was limited almost entirely to the pep 18 K H Meyer and F G Willson Ber 47 832 1914 SCIENCE 428SCIENCE tide linking It is evident however that such tautomeric structures enollactim and ketolactam may be present in other groupings and the results of this investi gation in no way limit the lipolytic activ ity to the peptide linking In view of the complexity of the protein molecule it is highly probable that such tautomeric groupings are present in combination with other groups and that the specificities of the actions are in part dependent upon these It must be admitted that the treatment of proteins with alkali to form active sub stances is rather drastic Unquestion ably simpler methods comparable to those taking place in nature will be found to pro duce the same effects The fact that dilute alkalis inactivated the castor bean globu lin lipase while a certain higher concen tration of alkali produced an esterhydro lyzing substance from the inactive globu lin preparation indicates that differently placed groups in the molecule were in volved in these two changes In how far the conclusions reached with lipase may be applied to other enzymes is a question It seems probable because of the comparatively simple treatments by which most enzymes may be inactivated that with them also a simple rearrangement or perhaps tautomeric change is connected with loss in activity There is however no reason to suppose that the active group ing is the same for all enzymes Each enzyme must be studied separately and conclusions as to the chemical nature of one active enzyme grouping can not with out further evidence be applied to an enzyme grouping connected with a different action The work described with lipase has given a definite point of view if nothing further from which the study of this enzyme may be continued and it seems prdbable that similar systematic studies with other enzymes would yield interesting and valuable results K GEORGE FALK HARRIMAN RESEARCH LABORATORY ROOSEVELT HOSPITAL NEW YORK

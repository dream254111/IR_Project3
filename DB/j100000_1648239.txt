THE AIR IN spite of a widespread prejudice against building castles in the air I propose this after noon to consider a construction of that kind for if castles are not to be built in the air where in the world are they to be built surely not underground or in the water All the castles I have ever seen were built in the air their foundations were in the ground of course but the castles themselves were in the air My proposal therefore needs no defense In view of the good number of castles already built some of them very high in the air even on mountain tops for occupation by the de fendants of various sciences it is gratifying to learn that plans are advancing for the erection here in Worcester of a castle of the particular kind in which my own interest iS most excited a geographical castle But it is on the other hand regrettable to find that the proposal to erect a castle a stronghold dedicated to geog raphy alone seems even in intellectual circles to need explanation if not justification so little is the vast and varied content of geog raphy understood so imperfectly is the great opportunity for original research in geography appreciated so halting is the recognition of the importance that the results of such research will have in the conservation and consecration of the wide spaces of the earth to the better advantage of mankind Let us try to rise to a realization of the geographical opportunity be fore us THE EPOCH OP GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION We must remember that the geographical epoch in which the first discovery of the gen 1 An address at the annual commencement of Clark University Worcester Mass on June 12 1922VOL LVI No 1440 eral outlinle of the lands and waters over the world was made is now closed The work that remains for the coming geographical epoch is not the discovery but the description of the earths features and their description can be properly prepared only by professional geo graphers unlike in disposition and training to the bold pathfinders who made the first entry into remote and unknown regions Moreover the labor involved in the future preparation of such descriptions will be enormously greater than that already expended in the epoch of discovery I fear that few persons have any idea of how much geographical work remains to be done or of the amount of labor demanded in doing it Let me tell you that even most of our own states for example Tennessee or Mon tana familiar by name to all of us and well known locally in an empirical way to many of their inhabitants have not yet been described with professional thoroness There are abso lutely no treatises not even handbooks in which the regional geography of most of our states is set forth in a thoroly competent and com prehensive manner How vastly ignorant then must we be of South America Africa and Asia The geography of the world is really yet to be written and in preparation for that writing the world must be explored all over again not by mere travellers but by geographical experts In order to carry on the reexploration of the world and give adequate opportunity for the preparation of the many scholarly volumes in which a competent description of the reex plored world shall be contained many institu tions in all parts of the world must cooperate and one of those institutions should be the geographical stronghold which we hope to see erected here THE ESSENTIAL OBJECTS OF A GEOGRAPHICAL STRONGHOLD WThat is the essential object of such a strong hold In the first place the object of a geo graphical stronghold may be most advantage ously reached if it is built up over a well planned lower story in which introductory col legiate instruction shall be offered in geography and other undergraduate subjects but in the stronghold itself the object should be primarily geographical research and only secondarily geographical teaching Let me at once make clear and insist upon this main reason for the construction of a geographical stronghold It should nbt be planned primarily to provide either introductory or utilitarian instruction altho such instruction should not be altogether excluded from it The main reason for the construction and maintenance of the strong hold should be to add geographical contribu tions to the sum of human knowledge without regard to what is called their practical value Immediate usefulness direct application of the knowledge gained should not be made a prime requisite in an institution of research and particularly not in a geographical stronghold because the higher branches of geography are as yet so little developed The essential tasks of a geographical stronghold will therefore not be the imparting of geographical knowledge so that it may be imparted again elsewhere as in teaching or so that it may be applied else where as in geographical engineeringI will explain later what geographical engineering is If the work be mainly of that utilitarian nature the stronghold will be from the point of view which I wish to insist upon largely a failure The first duty of a geographical stronghold or to use its proper name of a Graduate School of Geographymust be geographical research and until such research has advanced well beyond its present limits the acquisition and not the dissemination of geographical knowledge must be the main object in view the dissemination of the acquired knowledge will follow as a secondary duty It may be well urged for many years to come that even in the case of graduate students the best way to prepare them for the higher reaches of geographical science will not be to impart to them the geographical knowledge already gained teaching of that kind is properly the task of a college The correspondingly proper task of a professional graduate school is the cultivation of profiieyll ill the pursuit of new knowledge nlld sucI1 profirienly is best ac quired not by direct instruction in formal lecture courses but by placing those who wish to acquire it in close association with others who already proficient are using their profi ciency in research 122 SCIENCEAUGUST 4 1922 RESEARCH THE BEST PREPARATION FOR HIGHGRADE PRACTICAL WORK Geography is not peculiar in that respect I have it on good authority that even in chemis try a science of enormous practical importance the best training for a chemical engineer is not alone the study of those chemical processes which are already known to have practical value hut the investigation of new processes without regard to their application and this for the good reason that the essential thing for the really proficient chemical engineer is not simply to know this or that treatment of a problem which has already been solved but to know how best to attack and solve new prob lems Knowledge of that sort comes best by attacking and trying to solve new problems under the guidance of experts who are them selves chiefly engaged in solving new problems So with the development of a really proficient geographer It will not be enough to teach him a certain share of what is already known about geography he must learn how to find out more than is already known and the very best way for him to do that is to spend a few years in an institution primarily devoted to geographical research A STAFF OF NINE PROFESSORS OF GEOGRAPHY Of what should such an institution consist I have thus far described it as a castle a strong hold but I hardly need say that the most im portant elements of such a stronghold are not walls but men geographers They must of course have rooms to work in and I hope that the Graduate School of Geography in Clark University will eventually occupy a large build ing planned for and devoted to research but the essential thing is the men A strong staff of full professorial rank will be needed There should be at least one professor for each grand division or continent hence five in all it would be much better to have two for each of the less known continents South America Africa and Asia or eight professors in all and another should be added for Australia Polynesia and the oceans thus making nine in all Those nine geographers or five if nine cannot be secured would constitute the central and per manent staff of the institution There should be a good number of others temporarily or peripherally attached as I will explain later and all of these should be in addition to and independent of the geographical staff for un dergraduate instruction in the college If you suggest that one or two geographers for a continent is a lavish provision I must insist that it is a small provision For each geographer must be responsible for the regional description of a large area and that means that he must know the form of its surface its climate its more important vegetable and ani mal occupants its human inhabitants its po litical subdivisions its products and industries and its transportation and trade And all these subjects must be known not as made up of isolated items unrelated to each other but as correlated items all in their natural and interdependent juxtaposition thus constituting the landscapes and manifesting the activities of the region To know so much as that about a continent is no small responsibility But in addition to this continental responsibility in regional geography each member of the staff should be a specialist in the subject of one of the eight larger systematic divisions of geog raphyland and water forms climate plant geography animal geography human geog raphy economic geography historical geog raphy and history of geography the differ ence between the regional and the systematic aspects of geography being this In each di vision or special subject of systematic geog raphy such as land and water forms climate and the rest all the classes of facts treated under that subject should be studied in what ever part of the world their examples are found while in each large division of regional geography such as North America or Africa all kinds of facts to whatever special subject of systematic geography they belong must be studied in their natural associations Surely when the work to be done in a geographical stronghold is thus envisaged a permanent staf of nine men will not seem too large REGIONAL GEOGRAPHY THE CULMINATION OF GEOGRAPHICAL SCIENCE Let me make it clear why I lay so much emphasis on regional geography in contrast to systematic geography However important the different divisions of systematic geography are SCIENCE 123Von LVI No 1440 they yield only a discontinuous sort of knowl edge Under the division of land forms we may study about volcanoes and learn as much as possible about all of them wherever they are but the items of knowledge that we thus gain compel us to leap about all over the world in order to locate them Similarly we learn under human geography all about fishing villages wherever situated but there again we must leap about to locate the items that we learn On the other hand the study of regional geog raphy gives us a continuous or areal sort of knowledge If we study the regional geog raphy of Japan for example we shall learn not only the distribution of its many volcanoes and its many fishing villages but of all its other geographical features and it is this con tinuous or areal knowledge that is usually and properly implied when we speak of geography in a general way The study of the various divisions of systematic geography has indeed its chief value as a preparation for the study of regional geography hence no one should consider himself a geographer until he has be come expert in the regional geography of at least one large area preferably a continent Moreover not until such expertness is gained is a geographers knowledge likely to be of practical application in such a profession as geographical engineering A thoro representa tion of regional geography is therefore essential in a well developed Graduate School of Ge ography RESEARCH BY EXPLORATION How will these nine geographers do their work First and foremost each one of them will be expected to take part from time to time in the actual exploration of the continent for which he is responsible or in the investigation of his special subject in systematic geography and between times he must make himself ac quainted with the work of other explorers of his continent and of other investigators in his special systematic subject His own explora tory work in which he should be accompanied by one or more advanced students will require absence from Worcester for periods of half a year or a year every three four or five years and the digestion and publication of the re sults of his exploration will require after he returns home at least twice as much time as he spent in the field The rest of his time at home should be given to the study of explora tions and investigations by others so that each one of the nine professors shall become a rec ognized center of absorption and radiation of regional and special knowledge On this plan two professors would ordinarily be absent every year three or four others would be engrossed in preparing for publication the material they secured in the field during their absence one or two years before and each of the remaining three or four professors would be very busy in reviewing and assimilating the work of other geographers in various parts of the world as far as it referred to matters for which he is responsible If under these conditions any professor finds that he has some free time left over he might give it to the preparation and delivery of set courses of lectures CURATORS AND 3MATERIAL EQUIPMENT You may have noticed that apart from the staff of nine professors nothing has yet been said about the rest of the Schools establish ment While I still maintain that the essential feature of the School must be its corps of re search professors there are also other features of equipment which the professors will say are essential even if I do not There must be in the first place a compre hensive library of geography and allied sub jects in charge of a scholarly librarian not simply a man who will put books back in their places on the shelves but a man well versed in geographical literature an active collaborator with the professors in keeping the library up to date in all its departments and perhaps hav ing so great an interest in geographical pro duetion as to serve as editor of the Schools publications There must be in the second place a complete collection of modern large scale topographical and hydrographical maps of all countries which publish such maps and this collection should be in charge of a carto grapher not a mere draftsman but an experi enced craftsman with a real understanding of the outdoor things that maps represent and a dextrous hand for the construction of such new maps as are needed in the School work instruction in so much of surveying and map SCIENCE 124AUGUST 4 1922 making as young geographers need might be given by this member of the staff In the third place there should be a large and growing col lection of models in charge of a trained and skilful modelmaker not a mere artificer but a geographer of artistic capacity and outdoor experience competent to design and construct truthfully expressive models himself There should be in the fourth place an extensive and evergrowing collection of geographical photo graphs not in charge of a mere photographer but of a geographer competent to make scien tific selection of characteristic views for the illustration of geographical subjects and re gions And in the fifth place there should be a comprehensive collection of the products of all countries in charge of an experienced economic geographer unless the School proposes to de pend for such material on the great Commer cial Museum in Philadelphia The material equipment of a graduate school of geography is therefore a somewhat formidable matter It must be vigorously looked after A CENTRAL BUREAU FOR GEOGRAPHICAL ILLUSTRATIONS Let me say a few words more about the col lections of geographical photographs and models in order to explain the manner in which such collections may be made useful not only in Clark University but all over the coun try wherever geography has recognition Every college where geography is taught needs a col lection of lantern slides for the illustration of its lectures At present each professor of geography in all those colleges has to buildup his own collection as best he can as a result such collections are very uneven and imperfect There is no central bureau where well selected sets of lantern slides for the illustration of special subjects or of special regions can be obtained What a boon it would be for pro fessors of geography in every part of the United States if the Graduate School of Ge ography at Clark University would undertake to form a standard collection of photographs and lantern slides not a finished collection but a constantly growing collection from which one could order for example an elementary set of 10 slides or an advanced set of 50 slides for the illustration of the physical geography of coasts or an elementary set of 15 slides or an advanced set of 100 slides for the illustration of the regional geography of Colorado A great amount of correspondence and travel of reading and study would be required before such a collection was well developed but when it came to be known that the sets made up from the collection were composed of pictures critically selected by a competent geographer so that they would really accomplish their pur pose all geographical eyes would be often turned to Clark A SERIES OF GEOGRAPHICAL MODELS A similarly beneficient work could be done by establishing a standard collection of geo graphical models from which duplicates could be had at the cost of casting and coloring with out charge for the making Like the lantern slides these might illustrate both systematic and regional subjects Thus there might be a set of five models to exhibit the successive changes of a volcanic mountain from its youth of eruptive construction to its old age of ero sional degradation and so on for other physical features Similarly there might be models rep resenting certain striking features of different countries These on account of their expense would be less often sold to colleges than to museums where they would attract much atten tion but the systematic series would surely become popular as well as serviceable in the geographical laboratories of colleges for such models may serve not only in illustration of type forms but as the basis for very disciplin ary exercises in landscape description a phase of geographical instruction which is too gen erally neglected Such instruction may be ad visedly begun in field excursions where it can be grounded on the direct observation of na ture but the variety of landscape on which advantageous exercise may be had will be greatly extended if field excursions are supple mented by models But I must turn away from this attractive topic and consider again the Graduate School itself AN ENCOURAGING ANALOGY FROM ASTRONOMY If we now return to consider the work of the research professor perhaps you will ask Is it really worth while to study the world in so much detail as has been thus far implied Let SCIENCE 125VOL LVI No 1440 me answer that question by a celestial analogy The astronomical observatory maintained on Mt Wilson in Southern California by the Car negie Institution of Washingtonthis being a shining example of one of those lofty mountain top castles already alluded tohas a corps of highgrade astronomers devoting all their time and abilities to the study of the sun and the stars They have nothing whatever to do with teaching They never stop to ask whether their discoveries will have practical application or not But first informing themselves thoroly in all branches of astronomy as well as in the allied sciences of mathematics and physics they perseveringly catalog and chart the stars large and small as so many facts of occurrence they measure their brightness with the photo meter and they analyze their composition with the spectroscope and marvellous to say by combining spectrum and brightness they de termine the distance of stars that are so im mensely far away that they have no measurable parallax They give the most ingenious and penetrating study to the distribution and move ment of stars in space They determine with great accuracy the periods of revolution of what are known as spectroscopic doubles the two components of which cannot be separated even by the most powerful telescopes Can you conceive of anything more utterly useless And yet the world applauds their work The spirit of devotion to research which characterizes the staff of an astronomical ob servatory is the spirit which should dominate and guide the staff of a Graduate School of Geography For if it be praiseworthy to spend years without the least regard to what is vainly called utility on the construction of catalogs and classifications of stars most of which are invisible to the naked eye and inconceivably distant from our solar system shall it not be praiseworthy also to spend years in the study of every geographical feature in every part of the world without the least regard to whether the study leads to utility or notT The facts of one science are of the heavens heavenly those of the other are of the earth earthy But who shall say that a ninth magnitude star in such and such a part of the sky is a more worthy ob ject of study than a ridge or a ravine in such and such a part of the earth The star may be very large but it is far away the ridge or ravine may be very small but it is near at hand The study of the earth our own earth is surely deserving of all the time and skill we can give to it And even if among various other geo graphical strongholds the one here to be es tablished eventually gains its quota of nine professors of geography there will be abundant work for all to do for years and years to come Indeed it is highly probable that what with the evergrowing demands of science the scope of the work to be done in geography will be ex panded about as fast as the advance of the work goes on THE STANDARDIZATION OF GEOGRAPHY But even as geography is now conceived do not imagine that the staff of nine professors will find their progress to be all clear sailing as if their courses were already charted and their duties specified That is by no means the case One of the most important parts of their work will be its standardization both as to con tent and as to rmethod concerning which many problematic matters now unsolved or imper fectly solved must be carried to a conclusion Let us examine first those touching the content of geography How shall the description of land forms be treated so as to distinguish that special division of geography from its relative in geology How much physical meteorology shall be in cluded in climatology What facts concerning the plants and animals of a region shall be treated in a truly geographical essay so that it shall not duplicate sections of botanical and zoological essays How shall the essential factors of economic and of historical geography be treated so that they shall have a quality of their own and not be merely selections from economics and history All these questions must be examined and answered before the geographer can assure himself that all phases of geography systematic as well as regional are not merely restatements of parts of other subjects He must see to it that all his own statements are essentially geographical state ments and of a kind that other subjects do not directly duplicate Not that the establish ment of sharp limits between the contents of 126 SCIENCEAUGUST 4 1922 neighboring sciences is desirable nor that trespassing upon a neighboring science is in itself undesirable but that when a geo grapher has so serious a responsibility placed upon him as the regional description of a large area of the earths surface he is more likely to meet it if it does not dissipate his time and energy and thought upon suibjects for which he is not responsible While I am speaking of this matter let me add that a geographer should resent the im plication made by those who argue that the interest or importance of certain nongeograph ical matters is reason enough for their intro duction into geographical essays To accept that argument is a confession that the truly geographical elements in geographical essays are of so little importance and interest that such essays need the stimulation of irrelevant mat ters That is not true Geography needs no padding no seasoning by items and scraps of other subjects It is like them sufficient unto itself Did you ever hear of an astronomer or a geometer or a physicist or a botanist who thought that his science needed to be spiced up by any other in order to attract attention Never All kinds of subjects must be studied and studied for themselves in this studious world and geography is one of them Let geography therefore be pursued as earnestly as devotedly as wholeheartedly and as single mindedly as any other subject and let it accept cheerfully and contentedly the place that it can win on its own merits in the constellation of the sciences THE LIMITS OF GEOGRAPHY It is however certainly a curious thing that geography still needs the development and defi nition of its content in the manner that I have just intimated One might almost call it a moron among the sciences for altho it is very old in years it has not yet come into the full possession of its senses It is a part of the duty of trained professional geographers to arouse and awaken their science both by defin ing and by limiting its content especially in its regional aspect which is the culmination of geography The solution of this task is largely a question of the point of view and the essen tial point of view for a geographer is one from which he can clearly see the actual constitution of a region as it exists in the today of human history Let it be remembered that as already noted the geography of a region of the earth must include its land and water forms its cli mate its more significant plants and animals its human inhabitants its political divisions its products and industries and its trade and transportation and that all these elements must be conceived in their actual special relations as they exist together and interact upon one another Regional geography is therefore an immensely complex subject even if all non geographical elements are excluded from it all the more wisely therefore should a geographer hold only to truly geographical elements as above intimated Indeed even when properly limited regional geography is so complex that some critics assert it cannot be successfully mastered and treated by one man There is no question that it can not successfully be treated by a geographically uninformed untrained un disciplined man or by a itrained man who gives part of his attention to other sciences and it may perhaps be true that it cannot be so well treated by one informed trained and disci plined geographer working alone as by several informed trained and disciplined geographers each responsible for a part of the total subject and all working together in a team No de cision need be made on that question now be cause the problem has never been given study long enough and serious enough to answer it My own belief however is that such a staff of professional geographers as I have indicated will after a score of years or more reach such a measure of success in their tasks as to show that oneman regional descriptions are of great value But if that judgment be wrong and if oneman geography be insufficient the remedy is simple enough geographical exploration must then be done by pairs of geographers or trios or quartettes or groups working together each member supplementing the work of his associates Whatever the decision is on this point matters very little today the essential thing is that the work must be done and done in the best way possible So much then for the content of geography Now for its method SCIENCE 127VOL LVI No 1440 THE ART OF GEOGRAPHICAL DESCRIPTION The staff of a Graduate School of Geography will have to take their share not only in defin ing and cultivating a scientific method of geo graphical investigation they must also develop an artful method of geographical description While a geographer is in the field the subject of his investigation and his method of attack ing it will occupy his mind When he returns home the statement of his results in form for their communication to others will occupy his mind In both occasions his mind will be fully occupied however great its capacity The science of investigation is somewhat technical I can not discuss it here but the art of pre sentation may be briefly considered Many results of exploration may be best presented on maps some results may be presented in photo graphs sketches and diagrams some in models and some in statistical tables but the great body of results is best presented in words Now while the geographical facts coexist sim ultaneously in their regions they can not be presented simultaneously in a report upon a region a written report must present them consecutively word after word line after line page after page It may surprise you to learn but I believe it to be true that the future staff of geographers in the Clark Graduate School of Geography will have a very serious problem to solve before they can establish even in gen eral terms a standard method of presenting or reporting upon the results of their explora tions By such a standard method I do not mean anything rigid and inflexible but a method that will give the reader of a report true and vivid concept of the region described For just as accuracy is the essential object in the science of investigation so intelligibility is the essential object in the art of presentation and one of these high qualities is about as difficult of acquisition as the other It is unfortunately true that certain leading geographers are stronger in the possession of their science with in themselves than in its presentation to others It would almost seem from their preference for possession and their indifference to the fine art of presentation that they hold possession to be in geography as it is in the law nine points of the whole ten but that is an un scholarly attitude Of what avail is knowledge if it is not clearly set forth of what value is an obscure presentation in which at least a part of the truth is lost I trust that no pro fessor or student of geography in Clark Uni versity will be indifferent in this matter for accuracy in investigation and intelligibility in presentation are correlated essentials and hence lack of intelligibility in presentation is too often an accompaniment of a sort of careless ness that is incompatible with accuracy in investigation ERRORS TO BE AVOIDED How is the art of geographical presentation to be acquired and communicated  Perhaps you may imagine that articles and reports of standard excellence in the presentation of prob lems in regional geography already abound and that all that is needed is to adopt and copy their method but such is by no means the case In the first place a large number of articles and books commonly classed as geo graphical are chiefly narratives in which the narrator often an untrained traveller gives a leading position to his personal experiences altho they are very subjective matters Narra tive presentation is certainly entertaining to the general reader and it is not to be dispensed with but it falls far short of satisfying the ob jective demands of scientific geography just as the narrative of a plant collector would fall short of the demands of scientific botany In the second place many geographical arti cles and reports altho they are presented in a descriptive instead of in a narrative form nevertheless treat problems of less extent than those of fullfledged regional geography they are useful contributions to the geographical science but they fail to reach a complete re gional treatment In the third place many articles that are in part regional are also in part analytical in that they attempt to demon strate an explanation for some fact or phe nomenon that they describe indeed such arti cles are often largely geological in that they turn attention away from the facts of today and direct it to the past conditions and pro cesses by which the presentday facts have been brought about Articles of this kind are in 128 SCIENCEAUGUST 4 1922 dispensable to progress but their analytical discussions should be completed before regional description is begun their results should be standardized and systematized before they can be properly used in regional description and when the results are employed in their stand ardized and systematized form the analysis upon which the standardization and systema tization are based should not be repeated Ex planatory description in a regional essay should be used without any analytical demonstration THE DIFFICULTY OF REGIONAL DESCRIPTION Finally when regional description is at tempted it is too often inexpert in that it fails in the prime object of such description name ly to give a vivid account of all the geograph ical elements of a region in their natural and interdependent combinations Some such arti cles are faulty in a way that shows clearly enough how undeveloped the art of geograph ical presentation still is for they leave their readers to work out by the aid of such maps as they may possess various details of location which the author himself ought to have made clear once for all by map diagram or other wise Many other such articles are faulty in attempting to define the location of physical features or boundaries in terms of the location of small towns or villages the names of which are not only unknown to all readers but un discoverable even in good atlases Very few such articles present at the outset a simple ac count of the whole region and of its subdivi sions in such manner that whenever any local feature is later mentioned it may be at once and very easily located in terms of the intro ductory account and as a result geographical descriptions are often so obscure and difficult to follow that even geographers turn aside from them discouraged It is as if the investigator felt indifferent to the labor that his readers must undergo before they can learn what he has done without realizing that such indiffer ence costs him a loss of influence GEOGRAPHERS AND TRAVELLERS One of the reasons for these various defi ciencies in the present status of geography de serves explicit mention it is that the authors of articles published in the geographical peri odicals of the leading geographical societies of the world are in a regrettable number of in stances not trained and disciplined geograph ers but simply intelligent and observant trav elers It would seem that such persons on visiting and returning from a little travelled region were thereupon popularly classed as geographers whatever they were before their travels began and this idea is given support by the character of the membership of many geographical societies because such member ship is made up largely of generouslyminded persons who whether they have travelled or not are glad to support the work of the so cieties in which they are enrolled That they should do so is most gratifying but that they should be regarded as geographers because of so doing is disappointing To return to astronomy for an illustration do you suppose that the Astronomical Society of America is made up of intelligent persons who like to look at the nocturnal sky and recog nize the constellations and of persons who whether they like to look at the sky or not have pleasure in contributing to the cost of publishing an astronomical journal Not at all that society is made up of qualified as tronomers no others need apply But so far as I know only one of the many geographical societies in the world limits its members to geographers and altho its requirements for membership are not severe and ailtho diligent search has been made to discover as many qualified members as possible that society has not yet succeeded in discovering 200 persons fit to be members in its country of over 100 000000 population Whatever the cause of the characteristic im perfections in regional presentation today it is manifest that improvements can be made only by persistent conscious effort A large share of the attention of research professors in a Graduate School of Geography must be directed to making that effort successful MEANS AND MEN It is an easy matter to outline the constitu tion of a Graduate School of Geography ias I have just done It is a more serious matter to establish such a school Obstacles of two kinds stand in the way Those of one ind are merely difficulties those of the other kind are 129 SC0ENCEVoL LVI No 1440 more serious they are dangers The difficulties are only those of finding means and men Diffi culties of that kind can be overcome in time if they are attacked energetically and persistently Whether the means or the men will be the easier to secure I cannot say but as to the men I believe that relatively few will be found ready made they will have to be engaged in an immature stage and developed to maturity here and elsewhere Of course some fully competent geographers will be brought here ready at once to undertake research But it is more probable that the staff will be built up gradually by the engagement and promotion of young men A practical method to that end is to select a young man of promise and give him opportunity for growth by study and travel during which he may specialize in one subject or another then on his return he may be given an appointment for a term of years and at the end of that term he may be given permanent appointment if his work has been such as to justify it Gradual growth in some such way will I be lieve lead to better results than can be gained by the wholesale appointment of a full staff even if that were possible from the financial side of the problem In the mean time in struction by visiting lecturers and by professors invited for a year from Europe will add to the attractiveness chiefly in the undergraduate de partment of whatever regular instruction can be offered there but neither visiting lecturers nor temporary professors from abroad can give the solidity and continuity of work that should characterize a properly constituted and truly American Graduate School of Geography Hence if the proposed staff of nine research professors is established in 10 or 20 years that will be doing well remarkably well THE PROPER STANDARD FOR A GRADUATE SCHOOL OF GEOGRAPHY The dangers to be met are more serious They will arise chiefly from the pressure and urgency of students of undergraduate rank geographically whose needs indeed whose de ficiencies will tend to divert the professors of the Graduate School proper from their primary duty research to a secondary duty teaching I must here point out an essential difference between teaching and studying In secondary schools the teachers must do a great deal of teaching because the pupils are only just learn ing how to study In colleges the teaching by the professors and the studying by the students may about balance each other In properly constituted graduate schools the properly pre pared students should be expected to do most of their study by themselves the duty of the graduate staff of professors is chiefly to set example and pace by doing their own research work and to give occasional guidance to stu dents working with them but not to do set teaching Now the mere announcement that Clark University is going to establish a Graduate School of Geography will attract college grad uates to come here Some such graduates will be properly qualified by their previous studies to enter the Graduate School at once but many of them will come from colleges where the undergraduate teaching of geography is so im perfectly developed that they will not be suffi ciently grounded in the elements to enter upon truly advanced work What shall be done with such students when they arrive here Mani festly they should have more undergraduate instruction but they will not like to be en rolled with undergraduates again Yet if they are immediately admitted to the Graduate School of Geography its standard as a school of research will be injuriously lowered I therefore suggest that the present graduate department of the university be continued with out specification of subjects studied and that graduates of other colleges on coming here should be enrolled in that graduate department until they have completed the requirements for admission to the Graduate School of Geogra phy But even so the introductory teaching that they will need as well as the introductory teaching needed by Clark undergraduates who propose to make geography their life work will demand that a considerable body of under graduate teaching in geography be offered here and for that purpose three professors will be called for at the very least The danger is that the research professors in the Graduate School of Geography will be drawn into this work Naturally enough undergraduate geography will be developed here before the Graduate 130 SCIENCEAUGUST 4 1922 School of Geography is fully established and with such a beginning it may be difficult to establish a Graduate School of the kind I have outlined The college professors of geography will themselves wish to have some time for original studies some of them will wish to give graduate instruction And thus even if one or two research professors are added a half developed Graduate School of Geography may grow up in which research is only incidental and secondary and teaching of an under graduate grade is the larger duty The very respectability of such an arrange ment is ominous It will be so good that a better arrangement a real professional school of geography may be lost sight of and yet a mixed school of that sort will only be an other school of the mixed kind and being attached to a small university instead of to a large one it will have no particular merits it will not stand out with preeminence of its own As I am only a commencement speaker and not a trustee my duty goes no farther than to point out this threatening danger it will be for others to provide safeguards against it I may however note in passing that although a num ber of other universities have already reached the stage of offering geographical instruction in both their undergraduate and graduate de partments none of them thinks it worth while to segregate the graduate part of such instruc tion under so ambitious a name as a Graduate School of Geography and I believe that they are quite right in not doing so because they do not propose for the present at least to pro vide opportunity for advanced work in geogra phy so far in excess of that provided in other subjects as to warrant the announcement of a School of Geography It is here that the op portunity for geography in Clark University is likely to be for a long time unique because in this university geography is if I understand the plans of the trustees correctly to be given as great preeminence over other subjects of graduate study as possible It can not reach great preeminence immediately for as I have already pointed out it is not possible immedi ately to secure a staff of research professors The unique feature of geographical oppor tunity at Clark is therefore the aim in view namely to establish a real Graduate School of Geography as soon as possible The recent ap pointment of a geographer to the presidency of the university is evidence of the seriousness with which this aim is regarded by the trustees They have my heartiest good wishes for their success but it is evident that success can not be reached if the research professors in the Graduate School are distracted from their proper work by the necessity of giving under graduate instruction UNDERGRADUATE PREPARATION FOR GRADUATE WORK There is a second danger about as serious as the first Properly qualified members of a properly constituted Graduate School of Geog raphy ought not only to have already acquired a good understanding of fundamental under graduate courses in geography they should also have acquired a good understanding of some one or two other subjects allied to those systematic divisions of geography in which they propose to specialize The requisite under graduate courses in geography itself should rep resent several of the chief systematic divisions of geographical science for example land and water forms climatology human geography economic geography and also one or two intro ductory courses in regional geography for ex ample North America and some other con tinent These taken together should constitute the equivalent of a whole years undergraduate work at least But in addition thereto a stu dent who proposes to specialize in one or an other division of systematic geography should have made good undergraduate progres in some other subject closely allied to that divi sion Thus one who specializes in human geography should have taken several undergraduate courses in the allied subject of history on one hand or in anthropology and ethnology on the other A student who proposes to specialize in economic geography should be well prepared in the allied subject of economics and one who selects plant geography or animal geog raphy for his special subject of preference should be well grounded in the allied subject of botany or zoology and so on These allied subjects should occupy from half a year to a SCIENCE 131SCIENCE year of undergraduate study Furthermore a real facility in reading French and German and still more important a trained capacity to write good English should be included among the results of undergraduate study No stu dent of whatever college he may be a graduate should be admitted to the Clark Graduate School of Geography if he falls seriously short in any of these undergraduate requirements He may be admitted of course to the graduate department of the university if he holds a bachelors degree from any reputable collegiate institution but so long as he has serious defi ciencies in the undergraduate preparation for the graduate study of geography he ought not to be admitted to the Clark Graduate School of Geography or to any other such graduate school For in just so far as a member of a professional graduate school uses his time there on undergraduate studies he lowers the stand ing of the school and any one who looks on the high standing of his school with pride should be jealous of all influences which tend to lower it The seriousness of this danger of unprepar edness and the importance of establishing safe guards against it ought to be manifest to any one who is familiar with the demoralizing influ ence exerted on a graduate students work for a higher degree by the necessity of making up undergraduate deficiencies at the same time Work for a higher degree should occupy a stu dents whole attention If in his graduate years he is giving part of his time to undergraduate subjects which he ought to have studied earlier he is not only distracted thereby from his proper graduate work but the graduate work which he does will be weakened by reason of not being based on a completed foundation In a word the student members of a professional graduate school ought to be well trained for the work that they have to do there as such they would constitute a select body of which any institution must be proud THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STUDYING AND BEING TAUGHT You may now understand better than be fore what was meant by my earlier insistence that teaching should not be a prime duty of the research professors in a true Graduate School of Geography for the fact that they are not to teach does not imply that they are to have no students Of course they are to have students properly qualified graduate students and the students are to study but the pro fessors are not to teach in the ordinary sense of the word The students having reached that stage of their education when they have learned how to study and when they really wish to study are to study chiefly by themselves on their special subjects The professors are to propose problems for them to advise and to guide them in the study of the problems to hold conferences with them but not to teach them And with the conception of a body of professors devoted chiefly to research in the several departments of a single science and of a body of students devoted chiefly to study in different subdivisions of the same science you may imagine the atmosphere by which a Gradu ate School should be enveloped It is one of the most delightful most inspiring atmos pheres in which human beings can live THE PREPARATION o0 TEACHERS OF GEOGRAPHY A practical question may however rise in your minds If the requirements of a Graduate School of Geography are so high is it likely that any students will wish to enter it I can give several very confident answers to that question In the first place a candidate for the position of teacher in a secondary school ought not to be encouraged to enter it He acquired during his undergraduate college years as much knowledge of the subjects which he is to teach as he will need and moreover inas much as a school teacher should be more inter ested in the boys and girls that he teaches than in the subjects which the boys and girls are to be taught it is not necessary for him to carry preparatory studies to the point of becoming engrossed in research In the second place a candidate for the position of professor of geog raphy in a college should without question be encouraged to enter such a Graduate School of Geography as I have outlined and to stay there long enough to earn a masters degree at least and a doctors degree if possible College pro fessors ought to be learned persons and as a preparatory step toward becoming learned they 132 VOL LVI No 1440AUGUST 4 1922 ought to have breathed an atmosphere of learn ing for a year or two To be sure a candidate for a professorship in a college where the teaching of geography is combined with the teaching of another subject may make the other subject his first interest and may not therefore feel justified in carrying his geographical preparation very far But it is encouraging to see that geography is coming to be recognized in more and more of our colleges as a subject large enough and important enough to occupy the whole of a professors time Young men who have the ambition to be professors of geography in colleges of that grade should be urged to take a doctors degree in geography and to young men of that sort the Clark Grad uate School of Geography should be powerfully attractive if it is organized on the lines I have indicated GEOGRAPHICAL ENGINEERS But there is an altogether different group of positions for which young men will be increas ingly needed as the affairs of the world now so disordered return to a more normal condition and as in consequence of that return interna tional commerce comes to flourish again par ticularly those branches of international com merce which have to do with the less known con tinents of South America Africa and Asia At that time which we may hope will not be too long delayed many of our larger commercial houses will find as some of the most enterprising have already found that they need much more information than is ordinarily available regard ing the more distant parts of the world and they will learn that it is profitable to secure that information from trained experts In my opinion the experts who can best give that sort of information will be high grade geographers who have specialized in economic geography as well as in the regional geography of one or an other continent The Clark Graduate School of Geography ought to make a specialty of training such men their specialty ought to be called geographical engineering and those who become proficient in it ought to receive the degree of geographical engineer Needless to add that training of that kind must be based on a broad and firm foun dation of undergraduate studies in a well equipped college and must be extended by con tinuing those studies in a thoroughgoing pro fessional School of Geography and the train ing will need one other element namely after the professional study is well advanced a year of studious travel in the continent selected for special attention For although the later work of a geographical engineer must be largely of so practical a nature as to satisfy the money making demands of commerce the preparation for that work can not be made by learning definite answers to set questions The problems that the geographical engineer has to answer will be as a rule so novel so individual that his best training for them will be found first in the comprehensive acquisition of all the funda mental knowledge in his specialty and second in the original study of novel and individual problems in the same specialty that is research in economic geography Hence even for this most practical field of geographical science experts will be best made ready by close association with older experts who are carrying on researches in the same field Men who have received highgrade preparation of that kind will be sought for and prized THE CLARK SCHOOL A CENTER OF GEOGRAPH ICAL AcTVITY Can you not imagine the eagerness and earnestness with which the students in a Graduate School of Geography will pursue their studies They will be proud of their association with a staff of research professors they will be devoted to their science and de lighted with the opportunity that the school affords of advancing themselves in it they will be ambitious to become proficient in the science and to apply their proficiency to serious tasks in the actual world Can you not understand also that the presence of such a Graduate School of Geography in Worcester with its corps of expert professors its well developed material equipment its body of enthusiastic students and its exhilarating scholarly atmos phere will attract intending and returning travelers to visit it to stay near it for a timne and to establish more or less formal relations with it An intending traveler may well spend several months under its influence while making preparations for his journey a returning tra 133 SCIENCEVOL LVI No 1440 eler may advisedly remain an entire year in its wholesome atmosphere while writing his ac count of an accomplished journey Can you not see that the school will thus become a nota ble center of geographical activity if its devel opment follow serious professional lines It will inevitably become such a center and it will thereby exert a greatly needed and most benefi cent influence on the cultivation of scientific geography all over our country That the be ginning now made should have some such con summation is my devout wish When that wish is realized then wherever geography is seriously spoken of in America the speaker and his hearers will find themselves thinking sponitane ously of the Graduate School of Geography at Clark University WILLIAM MoRRtI DAVIS HARVARD UNIVERSITY THE RESEARCHES OF ALFRED GOLDSBOROUGH MAYOR ALFRED G MAYOR brought to research an unusual personality He had an extraor dinary artistic sense both for color and form he had a training in physics and engineering in accordance with a parental desire he had the brilliancy in conversation that made him an excellent companion on expeditions or after work hours he had a capacity for meeting peo ples of all kinds and conditionswthter in social events in cities or among the natives of the shore of Torres Straits and he had an industry that outran his strength After graduating from Stevens Institute he went to Clark University as assistant to Pro fessor Michelson and then to the University of Kansas where he taught physics for parts of two years While there he made biophysical studies on leaves and published the results after going to Harvard Mayors artistic sense lured him to study animals He had as a boy made the most beautiful paintings of butter flies of iridescent types which looked as though their wings had been pasted on the page His first research at Harvard was on the development of the wing scales and their pigment in butterflies and moths 1896 and this was quickly followed by a contribution of 87 pages and 10 for the most part colored plates On the color and pattern of moths and butterflies These papers revealed three major interests of the author a a fine artistic sense with a special attraction toward color b a tendency to make crucial experi ments to test mooted points and c a fonld ness for physical experimentation Thus he used in these researches the spectroscope to study the pigments and a pendulum to deter mine the friction of wing scales on the air In the latter experiment on butterflies the wings were studied with their scales on and also removed The later paper stimulated Alfred R Wallace to discuss it in Nature Five years later Mayor published further researches on Lepidoptera and analyzed the elements of their color patterns He returned again to the Lepidoptera in 1906 when he pub lished a paper with Miss Soule on some reac tions of caterpillars and moths He studied not only their reactions to light food and gravity and their feeding habits but continued the studies he had begun six years earlier on mate selection Wings of males were painted with scarlet or green ink and males were variously maimed Color made no difference with matings but the maimed males met more resistance than normals to copulation unless the female was blinded Mayor had not been long at the museum in Cambridge before his artistic work attracted the attention of Alexander Agassiz and led to an invitation to him to accompany Agassiz on his trip to the Bahamas in Mr Forbes yacht Wild Duck in 1893 This was the first of a series of voyages with Agassiz up to 1900 to the Great Barrier Reef of Australia in 1896 to the Fiji Islands in 18978 to the tropical Pacific on the Albatross in 18991900 On these voyages Mayor made drawings and observations on radiatesespecially the Me dusee These fascinated him as they did that other arti tniatnlaliVtf TToeckel The outcome of thee tilii il l lilh of later years ap peared eventually in Mayors Medusae of the World and Ctenophores of the Atlantic published by the Carnegie Institution and illustrated by scores of plates drawn by his own hand and brush To this period

L T R A N S A C T I O N S I AN ACCOUNT OF A MUMMY INSPECTED AT LONDON 1763 IN A LETTER TO WILLIAM HEBERDEN M D F R S FROM JOHN HADLEY M D F R S DEAR SIR O N THE 16TH OF DECEMBER 1763 DR WOLLASTON DR BLANSHARD DR HUNTER DR PETIT THE REV MR EGERTON LEIGH AND MR HUNTER MET AT MY HOUSE THAT WE MIGHT TOGETHER INSPECT A MUMMY WHICH I HAD RECEIVED FROM THE MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY READ JAN 12 1764 OUR INTENTION WAS TO EXAMINE THE MANNER IN WHICH THIS PIECE OF ANTIQUITY HAD BEEN PUT TOGETHER TO COMPARE IT WITH THE ACCOUNTS GIVEN OF THESE PREPA RATIONS BY ANCIENT AUTHORS AND TO SEE WHETHER THERE WERE ANY TRACES LEFT OF THE SOFTER PARTS AND IF SO BY WHAT MEANS THEY HAD BEEN PRESERVED A GREATER V O L LIV B NUMBER2 NUMBER OF AUTHORS HAVE WRITTEN ON THIS SUBJECT THAN I WAS AWARE OF SO THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY WE HAVE NOT MADE ANY NEW DISCOVERIES I ENCLOSE TO YOU THE RE SULT OF OUR ENQUIRY AND THE FEW OBVIOUS REFLEXIONS WHICH OCCURRED IF THEY APPEAR TO CONTAIN ANY THING WORTHY NOTICE YOU WILL PLEASE TO COMMUNICATE THEM TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY I AM DEAR SIR YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND CHARTERHOUSE JAN 10TH 1764 OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT JOHN HADLEY THE3 T H E MUMMY WHICH IS THE SUBJECT OF THE FOL LOWING PAGES IS THE FIRST ARTICLE IN DR GREWS CATALOGUE OF THE RARITIES OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY HE INFORMS US THAT IT WAS A PRESENT FROM HENRY DUKE OF NORFOLK AND WAS AN ENTIRE ONE TAKEN OUT OF THE ROYAL PYRAMIDS HE THEN PROCEEDS TO DESCRIBE THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SEVERAL PARTS WERE WRAPPED UP BUT THIS HE HAS NOT DONE EXACTLY AS MOST OF THESE VERY PARTS HAD EVIDENTLY NEVER BEEN OPENED TILL WE EXAMINED THEM AND WERE THEN FOUND IN A VERY DIF FERENT STATE FROM THAT IN WHICH THEY ARE REPRESENTED BY HIM THIS MUMMY HAD BEEN GREATLY INJURED BEFORE IT CAME INTO OUR HANDS THE HEAD HAD BEEN TAKEN OFF FROM THE BODY AND THE WRAPPERS WITH WHICH THEY HAD BEEN UNITED HAVING BEEN DESTROYED THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX WAS FOUND OPEN TOWARDS THE NECK AND PART OF THE UPPER CRUST WITH THE CLAVICLES HAV ING BEEN ALSO BROKEN AWAY THE HEADS OF THE OSSA HUMERI PRESENTED THEMSELVES COVERED WITH A THIN COAT OF PITCH THE FEET ALSO HAD BEEN BROKEN OFF FROM THE LEGS AND WERE FIXED BY WIRES TO THE END OF THE WOODEN CASE IN WHICH THE MUMMY LAY THE OUTWARD PAINTED COVERING WHICH REACHED FROM THE UPPER PART OF THE CHEST NEARLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LEGS HAD BEEN REMOVED AND FASTENED ON AGAIN BY A GREAT NUMBER OF ORDINARY NAILS DRIVEN UP TO THE HEAD INTO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE MUMMY THIS HAD MOST PRO BABLY BEEN DONE BY THOSE WHO HAD ORDERS SOME YEARS SINCE TO REPAIR IT AND BY THIS AND BY THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAD FASTENED ON THE FEET THEY SEEM TO HAVE DONE THEIR WORK IN A MOST CLUMSY MANNER B 2 THIS4 THIS WHOLE EXTERNAL COVERING OF THE FORE PART OF THE MUMMY CONSISTED OF SEVERAL FOLDS OF BROAD PIECES OF LINNEN CLOTH MADE TO ADHERE TOGETHER BY SOME VISCOUS MATTER WHICH HAD NOT YET LOST ITS PROPERTY AND THE WHOLE HAD RECEIVED AN ADDITIONAL DEGREE OF STRENGTH AND SUBSTANCE FROM THE COAT OF PAINT LAID ON THE FIGURES WHICH WERE NOT ENTIRELY DEFACED WERE SO MUCH OF THE SAME KIND WITH THOSE WHICH THE WRITERS ON THIS SUBJECT HAVE DESCRIBED AS TO MAKE ANY ACCOUNT OF THEM HERE NEEDLESS AND INDEED THEY WERE ALL SO MUCH INJURED AS TO RENDER A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THEM VERY DIFFICULT IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE THERE WERE NOT THE LEST REMAINS OF HAIR OR INTE GUMENTS ON ANY PART OF THE HEAD SOME PARTS OF THE SKULL WERE QUITE BARE PARTICULARLY ABOUT THE TEMPO RAL BONES WHICH HAD THE NATURAL POLISH AND APPEARED IN EVERY RESPECT LIKE THE BONES OF AN ORDINARY SKULL TO OTHER PARTS OF THE SKULL ADHERED SEVERAL FOLDS OF PITCHED LINNEN WHICH TOGETHER WERE NEAR HALF AN INCH IN THICKNESS ON REMOVING THEM THEY WERE FOUND TO HAVE BEEN IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE BONE SO THAT THE INTEGUMENTS MUST HAVE BEEN TAKEN AWAY BEFORE THE WRAPPERS WERE AT FIRST APPLIED THE UNDER JAW WAS LOST AND THE SUPERIOR MAXILLARY SPHENOIDAL AND ETHMOIDAL BONES WERE BROKEN AWAY THE FORAMEN OCCIPITALE WAS STOPPED UP WITH PITCH WITH WHICH ALSO THE INNER PART OF THE SKULL WAS LINED THIS SEEMED TO HAVE BEEN POURED IN AT THE FORAMEN AND MADE TO APPLY TO THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THE INSIDE OF THE SKULL BY TURNING THE HEAD IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS THE WAVE OF THE MELTED PITCH FROM SUCH MOTION APPEAR ING VERY PLAIN THE INSIDE OF THE SKULL WAS IN MANY PLACES COVERED VERY THINLY AND IN SOME FEW WHICH THE5 THE FLUID PITCH HAD MISSED IT WAS QUITE BARE THE PITCH WHICH STOPPED UP THE FORAMEN OCCIPITALE HAD ON IT THE IMPRESSION OF ONE OF THE VERTEBRAE OF THE NECK AND EXTERNALLY ABOUT THE FORAMEN ADHERED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF PITCH THE OUTWARD PAINTED COVERING BEING REMOVED NOTHING BUT LINNEN FILLETS WERE TO BE SEEN WHICH EN CLOSED THE WHOLE MUMMY THESE FILLETS WERE OF DIFFERENT BREADTHS THE GREATER PART ABOUT AN INCH AND A HALF THOSE ABOUT THE FEET MUCH BROADER THEY WERE TORN LONGITUDINALLY THOSE FEW THAT HAD A SELVAGE HAVING IT ON ONE SIDE ONLY THE UPPERMOST FILLETS WERE OF A DEGREE OF FINENESS NEARLY EQUAL TO WHAT IS NOW SOLD IN THE SHOPS FOR 2S 4D PER YARD UNDER THE NAME OF LONG LAWN AND WERE WOVEN SOMETHING AFTER THE MANNER OF RUSSIASHEET ING THE FILLETS WERE OF A BROWN COLOUR AND IN SOME MEASURE ROTTEN THESE OUTWARD FILLETS SEEMED TO OWE THEIR COLOUR TO HAVING BEEN STEEPED IN SOME GUMMY SOLUTION AS THE INNER ONES WERE IN PITCH THE FILLETS IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE PAINTED COVERING LAY IN A TRANSVERSE DIRECTION UNDER THESE WHICH WERE MANY DOUBLE THEY LAY OBLIQUE DIAGONALLY FROM THE SHOULDERS TO THE ILIA UNDER THESE THE FILLETS WERE BROADER SOME NEARLY THREE INCHES AND LAY LONGITU DINALLY FROM THE NECK TO THE FEET AND ALSO FROM THE SHOULDERS DOWN THE SIDES ON WHICH THERE WAS A RE MARKABLE THICKNESS OF THESE LONGITUDINAL FILLETS UN DER THESE THEY WERE AGAIN TRANSVERSE AND UNDER THESE AGAIN OBLIQUE THE FILLETS IN GENERAL EXTERNALLY DID NOT ADHERE TO EACH OTHER BUT THOUGH PIECES OF A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH COULD BE TAKEN OFF INTIRE YET FROM THE GREAT AGE SO6 SO TENDER WAS THE EXTTURE OF THE CLOTH THAT IT WAS IM POSSIBLE REGULARLY TO UNROLL THEM AS THE OUTWARD FILLETS WERE REMOVED THOSE THAT NEXT PRESENTED THEMSELVES HAD BEEN EVIDENTLY STEEPED IN PITCH AND WERE IN GENERAL COARSER IN FOLDS AND MORE IRREGULARLY LAID ON AS THEY WERE MORE DISTANT FROM THE SURFACE THE INNER FILLETING OF ALL WAS SO IMPREG NATED WITH PITCH AS TO FORM WITH IT ONE HARD BLACK BRITTLE MASS AND HAD BEEN BURNED NEARLY TO A COAL ON BREAKING THIS IT APPEARED IN MANY PLACES AS IF FILLED WITH A WHITE EFFLORESCENCE LIKE THAT OB SERVABLE ON THE OUTSIDE OF PYRITES WHICH HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE AIR THIS EFFLORESCENCE HOWEVER HAD NOTHING SALINE TO THE TASTE AND DID NOT DISSOLVE IN WA TER BUT INSTANTLY DISAPPEARED ON BRINGING IT NEAR ENOUGH TO THE FIRE TO BE SLIGHTLY HEATED AND WAS SOLU BLE IN SPIRIT OF WINE IN THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN WE FOUND SEVERAL SMALL PIECES OF BONE WHICH HAD THE APPEARANCE OF DRY OAK MIXED WITH CRUMBLED PITCH UNDER THIS WAS FOUND MORE SOLID PITCH WHICH ADHERED TO THE SPINE AFTER CUTTING AWAY THE MASS OF CLOTH AND PITCH WHICH COVERED THE THORAX WE FOUND THE ARMS HAD BEEN LAID STRAIT DOWN BY THE SIDES OF THE CHEST AND THE ULNA AND RADIUS BENT UPWARDS AND LAID WITH THE HANDS ACROSS UPON THE BREAST THE RIGHT HAND BEING UPPERMOST THE BONES OF THE FINGERS WERE LOST BUT THE ME TACARPAL BONES WERE FOUND BROKEN OFF AND FALLEN INTO THE THORAX THE FILLETING WHICH WENT ROUND THE UPPER PART OF THE BODY INCLUDED THE ARMS ALSO BUT THEY HAD EVI DENTLY7 DENTLY BEEN FIRST WRAPPED SEPARATELY THEN LAID UP IN THE POSITION IN WHICH WE FOUND THEM AND THE HOL LOWS WHICH THEY FORMED FILLED UP WITH PIECES OF PITCHED CLOTH IN THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX THERE WAS ALSO A CONSI DERABLE QUANTITY OF CRUMBLED PITCH AND SPLINTERS OF DRY BONE AND AS IN THE PROGRESS OF THIS EXAMINATION WE CONTINUALLY FOUND THAT SOME OF THE BONES DID AS WE LAID THEM BARE SEPARATE INTO SUCH SPLINTERS IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT THIS APPEARANCE WAS OWING TO THE MUMMYS HAVING BEEN HANDLED IN A ROUGH MAN NER AND MUCH SHAKEN BY THE PERSONS WHO HAD DRI VEN IT FULL OF NAILS WHEN THEY WERE EMPLOYED TO RE PAIR THE OUTSIDE OF IT ON OUR FIRST OPENING A WAY INTO THE THORAX WE IMAGINED THE RIBS WERE DESTROYED BUT UPON A MORE ACCURATE EXAMINATION THEY WERE FOUND ENTIRE BUT SO BEDDED IN THE PITCH AND SO BLACK AND BURNED INTO THE MASS AS TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DISTINGUISH THESE VERY DIFFERENT SUBSTANCES FROM EACH OTHER THE BONES OF THE SPINE AND OF THE PELVIS WERE IN THE SAME STATE WITH THE RIBS ONLY RATHER MORE BURNED THERE WAS A CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS OF HARD SOLID PITCH LINING THE CAVITY OF THE THORAX THIS HAD BEEN EVIDENTLY LIQUIFIED AND POURED IN AND RETAINED THAT GLOSSY APPEARANCE ON ITS SURFACE WHICH IS OBSERVA BLE ON PITCH THAT IS SUFFERED TO COOL WITHOUT BEING DISTURBED ON BREAKING THROUGH THIS HARD CRUST OF PITCH TO EXAMINE THE VERTEBRAE AND THE RIBS THE PITCH WHICH WAS UNDER THIS CRUST AND NEAREST TO THE BONES WAS CRUMBLY AND SOFT AND ON BEING EXPOSED TO THE AIR GREW PERFECTLY MOIST IN A VERY SHORT TIME 4 THE8 THE LOWER EXTREMITIES WERE WRAPPED SEPARATELY IN FILLETS TO NEARLY THEIR NATURAL SIZE AND THEN BOUND TOGETHER THE INTERSTICES BEING RAMMED FULL OF PITCHED RAGS ON CUTTING THROUGH THE FILLETS ON THE THIGHS THE BONES WERE FOUND INVESTED WITH A THIN COAT OF PITCH AND THE FILLETING WAS BOUND IMMEDIATELY ON THIS THE TIBIA AND FIBULA OF EACH LEG WERE FOUND ALSO WRAPPED IN THE SAME MANNER AND THE BONES IN ACTUAL CONTACT WITH THE PITCH EXCEPTING IN ONE OR TWO PLACES WHERE THE PITCH WAS SO VERY THIN THAT THE CLOTH APPEARED TO ADHERE TO THE BONE ITSELF THE FEET WERE FILLETED IN THE SAME MANNER BEING FIRST BOUND SEPARATELY AND THEN WRAPPED TOGETHER THE FILLETING HAD BEEN BY SOME ACCIDENT RUBBED OFF THE TOES OF THE RIGHT FOOT AND THE NAIL OF THE GREAT TOE WAS FOUND PERFECT THE LAST JOINTS OF THE BONES OF THE LESSER TOES HAD BEEN BROKEN AWAY BY WHICH IT AP PEARED THAT THESE BONES HAD BEEN PENETRATED AND THEIR CAVITIES QUITE FILLED WITH PITCH THE FILLETING ABOUT THE HEEL HAD ALSO BEEN BROKEN AWAY AND THE BONES OF THE TARSUS AND SOME OF THE METATARSAL BONES HAD FALLEN OUT AND WERE LOST LEAVING THE REMAINING FILLETING LIKE A KIND OF CASE THE FILLETS ON THE LEFT FOOT WERE PERFECT EXCEPT ON THE HEEL AND WHERE THEY HAD BEEN DIVIDED FROM THOSE OF THE LEG A SMALL PORTION OF THE TENDO ACHILLIS AD HERED TO THE OS CALCIS AND SOME OF THE LIGAMENTS TO THE ASTRAGALUS ON CUTTING INTO THE FILLETS ON THE SOLE OF THIS FOOT THEY WERE FOUND TO ENCLOSE A BULBOUS ROOT THE AP PEARANCE OF THIS WAS VERY FRESH AND PART OF THE THIN SHININGPHILOS TRANS VOL LIV TABI 9 3 1 2 4 5

I THIS DISCOVERY IMMEDIATELY BROUGHT TO MIND A PASSAGE IN PROSPER ALPINUS  AND GAVE SOME AP PEARANCE OF PROBABILITY TO A RELATION WHICH AS HE HIMSELF INSINUATES MIGHT GIVE GREAT REASON TO DOUBT HIS

RETAINING A REDDISH HUE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN PAINTED THE SKIN ALSO AND EVEN THE FINE SPIRAL LINES ON IT WERE STILL VERY VISIBLE ON THE UN DER PART OF THE GREAT TOE AND OF THE THREE NEXT AD JOINING TOES WHERE THE SKIN OF THE TOES WAS DE STROYED THERE APPEARED A PITCHY MASS RESEMBLING IN FORM THE FLESHY SUBSTANCE THOUGH SOMEWHAT SHRUNK FROM ITS ORIGINAL BULK THE NATURAL FORM OF THE FLESH WAS PRESERVED

EXTENSOR TENDONS THE ROOT JUST MENTIONED WAS BOUND TO THE FOOT BY THE FILLETING THAT INVESTED THE METATARSAL BONES NO MORE OF THIS FILLETING WAS CUT AWAY THAN WAS JUST SUFFICIENT TO SHEW WITHOUT REMOVING FROM ITS PLACE A SUBSTANCE WHICH HAD BEEN PRESERVED IN SO EXTRAORDINARY A MANNER ON CUTTING AWAY THE FILLETS WHICH COVERED THE TAR SUS THE BONES ADHERED STRONGLY TOGETHER AND WERE COVERED WITH HARD PITCH WITH WHICH THEY SEEMED THOROUGHLY IMPREGNATED ON CUTTING AWAY THIS OUTWARD PITCH THERE APPEARED VERY DISTINCTLY THE TENDONS OF THE PERONEUS ANTICUS AND POSTICUS THE TENDONS OF THE EXTENSOR DIGITORUM LONGUS AND THE TENDON OF THE TIBIALIS ANTICUS AND BE SIDES THESE A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF THE LIGAMENTS OF THE TARSUS ON EXAMINING THE CASE FORMED BY THE PITCH AND FILLETS WHICH HAD COVERED THE RIGHT FOOT AND OUT OF WHICH THE BONES HAD BEEN TAKEN THERE WAS A VERY PLAIN MOULD LEFT IN WHICH THERE HAD BEEN ENCLOSED ANOTHER ROOT SIMILAR TO THAT WE DISCOVERED IN THE LEFT FOOT AND IN WHICH SOME OF THE EXTERNAL SHINING SKIN OF THE ROOT STILL REMAINED DURING THIS WHOLE EXAMINATION IF WE EXCEPT WHAT WAS DISCOVERED IN THE FEET THERE WERE NOT FOUND THE LEST REMAINS OF ANY OF THE SOFT PARTS ALL THE BONES OF THE TRUNK WERE BEDDED IN A MASS OF PITCH AND THOSE OF THE LIMBS WERE COVERED WITH A THIN COAT OF IT AND THEN SWATHED IN THE FILLETS WHICH AS HAS BEEN MENTIONED IN SOME PLACESWHERE THE PITCH WAS VERY THIN SEEMED TO ADHERE TO THE BONE ITSELF THE11 THE CAVITIES OF MANY OF THE BONES ON BEING BRO KEN WERE FOUND QUITE FULL OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE ME TACARPAL BONES WERE SO AS WERE THE RADII AND MANY OTHERS THE RIBS AS WAS BEFORE MENTIONED WERE IMPREG NATED WITH IT AND SO BURNED AS TO BE WITH DIFFICULTY DISTINGUISHED FROM IT IN WHICH STATE ALSO WERE THE VERTEBRAE AND THE BONES OF THE PELVIS THE PITCH HAD ALSO PENETRATED INTO THE CELLULAR PART OF THE HEAD OF THE THIGH BONE THE SMALL BONES OF THE TOES WERE QUITE FULL BUT IT HAD NOT ENTERED INTO ALL THE METATARSAL BONES FROM EXPERIMENT IT HAS BEEN FOUND THAT BONES AND FLESH BEING BOILED IN COMMON PITCH IT WILL PER VADE THE SUBSTANCE AND FILL THE CAVITIES OF THE FORMER AND THE LATTER WILL BE SO IMPREGNATED WITH IT AS TO BE REDUCED TO AN UNIFORM BLACK BRITTLE MASS NOT IN THE LEST RESEMBLING FLESH THIS TREATMENT HOWEVER WILL NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE STATE IN WHICH THIS MUMMY WAS FOUND FOR IF THE FLESH HAD NOT BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMOVED THOUGH ITS APPEARANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY CHANGED YET THE FILLETING COULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FOUND IN CONTACT WITH THE BONES FROM THIS LAST CIRCUMSTANCE IT IS MOST LIKELY THAT THE BODY EXCEPTING THE FEET HAD BEEN REDUCED TO A SKELETON BEFORE IT WAS LAID UP IT IS ALSO PRETTY CERTAIN THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN KEPT SOME TIME IN BOILING PITCH BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER SOME OF THE LAYERS OF THE INNERMOST FILLETING WERE LAID ON THE FEET SEEM TO HAVE BEEN SWATHED AT LEST IN PART BEFORE THEY WERE COMMITTED TO THE HOT PITCH AND THIS SEEMS TO HAVE PERVADED THE BANDAGES THE FLESH AND THE BONES C 2 IT12 IT HAS BEEN IMAGINED THAT THE PRINCIPAL MATTER USED BY THE AEGYPTIANS FOR EMBALMING WAS THE AS PHALTUS BUT WHAT WE FOUND WAS CERTAINLY A VEGETA BLE PRODUCTION THE SMELL IN BURNING WAS VERY UN LIKE THAT OF ASPHALTUS NOR DID IT RESEMBLE THAT OF THE COMMON PITCH OF THE FIRTREE BEING RATHER AROMATIC IT WAS COMPARED WITH A VARIETY OF RESINS AND GUM  RESINS BUT SEEMED NOT TO RESEMBLE ANY OF THEM EXCEPTING MYRRH AND THAT BUT VERY SLIGHTLY IN ALL PROBABILITY IT WAS NOT A SIMPLE SUBSTANCE BUT MIGHT BE A MIXTURE OF THE RESINOUS PRODUCTIONS OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE PITCH OF THAT TREE WHICH THEY HAD IN GREATEST PLENTY THE    OF HERODOTUS  AND THE  OF DIDORUS SICULUS  WAS MOST PROBABLY THE TAR OF THE CEDAR IT IS THE SUBSTANCE SAID BY THESE AU THORS TO BE USED FOR EMBALMING GALEN  MENTIONS ITS POWER OF PRESERVING BODIES AND  DIOSCORIDES CALLS IT   PLINY SPEAKING OF THE CEDAR SAYS THAT THE TAR WAS FORCED OUT OF IT BY FIRE AND THAT IN SYRIA IT WAS CALLED CEDRIUM CUJUS TANTA VIS EST UT IN

YIELDED A FIXED ALKALI TO THIS MAY BE ATTRIBUTED THE MOISTURE WHICH THE PITCH THAT WAS IN CONTACT WITH THE SPINE AND THOSE OTHER PARTS WHICH WERE MOST BURNED CONTRACTED ON BEING BROKEN AND EXPOSED TO THE AIR FOR THIS PITCH HAD AN ALKALINE TASTE AND HAD BEEN MORE THAN MELTED HAV ING BEEN BURNED TO A CAPUT MORTUUM A GREAT VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE ON THIS PITCHY MATTER THE RESULT OF THEM ALL TENDED TO PROVE THAT IT HAD NOT THE LEST RESEMBLANCE TO ASPHALTUS BUT WAS CERTAINLY A VEGETABLE RESINOUS SUBSTANCE MONS ROUELLE IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE ROYAL ACA DEMY OF SCIENCES FOR 1750 HAS GIVEN US A VERY ELA BORATE AND INGENIOUS TREATISE ON EMBALMING WHEREIN HE HAS CHEMICALLY ANALYSED THE PITCH OF SIX DIFFERENT MUMMIES FROM HIS OBSERVATIONS FROM WHAT PIETRO DELLA VALLE AND JOANNES NARDIUS  AT THE

CAYLUS IN THE 23D VOL OF ACAD DES INSCRIPT ET BELLES LETTRES AND FROM THIS PRESENT EXAMINATION IT APPEARS THAT VARIOUS METHODS OF EM BALMING WERE PRACTISED AMONG THE AEGYPTIANS AND THAT THEY USED DIFFERENT MATERIALS FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THOUGH HERODOTUS AND DIODORUS SICULUS HAVE GIV EN US REASON TO EXPECT TO FIND THE BODIES IN A MUCH MORE PERFECT STATE THAN WE EVER DO MEET WITH THEM YET ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE FOOT OF THIS MUMMY WHICH WE EXAMINED AND FROM THE ACCOUNT MONS ROUELLE AND COUNT CAYLUS HAVE GIVEN US IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED MEMOIRES THAT ALL THE FLESHY PARTS WERE

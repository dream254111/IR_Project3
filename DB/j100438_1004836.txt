Isaac Hays Read July 15 18031 ASTRONOMERS generally admit the existence of a species ot dilatation of the apparent magnitudes of luminous bodies which is called irradiation the amount of which has not been exactly measur ed nor the cause explained on any physical or physiological principle and as it produces an augmentation of the apparent diameter of the suns disc they are compelled to make an approximate allowance for it in the calculation of eclipses whose time of beginning and duration as calculated from the measured apparent diameters of the sun and moon it is thought sensibly to affect I am not aware that this amplifica tion has been suspected to be greater in one direction than another This may be one reason why its influence on particular phenomena has not been more accurately ascertained and why its assumed value has been justly considered so unsatisfactory an element in astronomi cal calculations I shall state some of the laws of this phenomenon which I think I have established and particularly the determinate directions in which the maximum irradiation generally takes place in the human eye I shall also propose an hypothesis respecting the cause of this phenome non or at least its connexion with a certain aniatomical structure I know not whether there is any plausible hypothesis respecting the  It does not however affect the actual timeON IRRADIATION 341 cause of irradiation The subject is rarely mentioned in books and still more rarelv is there found any thing but a bare mention of the fact M Biot in his valuable work on physical astronomy avoiding as usual every expression which might involve any hypothesis not ap parently warranted by known facts has the following incidental notice of this subject with reference to the phases of Venus Ces diminu tions et ces accroissemens ne sont pas sensibles a la vue simple a cause de lirradiation qui dilate un peu les diametres apparens des objets et dautant plus quils sont plus eclaires This expresses the fact of the dilatation and its increase as the objects are more luminous This is probablv the only law of the phenomenon hitherto known I have searched several works on physiology optics and astronomy without finding any thing written expressly on this subject except a single page in Delambres complete work on theoretical and practical as tronomy from which the following extracts have been made  On a suppose que les diametres des objets lumineux etaient amplifies par limpression vive que leur lumiere produit sur lorgane de la vue  quil faut depouiller le soleil de cette couronne lumineuse qui len toure non pas en realite mais dans notre ceil  cest un point qui nest pas encore suffisamment eclairci From the last of these extracts referring apparently to the existence precise amounit and cause of this amplification we learn that it re quires further investigation from the second that it is believed to exist only in the eye and in the first there seems to be an intimation that it depends upon the sentient part of this organ It therefore appears to be an interesting and legitimate object of physiological inquiry I am far from professing to be able at present to supply all the de siderata on this important subject yet I caninot but hope that I may have facilitated the attainment of this object by the discovery of some new laws of irradiation and perhaps the anatomical structure if not the optical principle on which it depends One new law which I think established bya induction from nume rous facts may be enunciated as follows There are determinate directions of maximum irradiation for every individual these in man for ordinary vision are generally three in number and are at equal angular distances which are consequently one hundred and twenty VOL IV4 L3 42 ON IRRADIATION degrees or one third of the circumference of the circle one direction being in the erect position of the head directly upward in a vertical visual plane passing through the centre of the luminous object the two other directions obliquely downward in visual planes which re spectively make angles with the former and with each other of one hundred and twenty degrees Every one has observed a radiated appearance of the stars and of the flame of a distant lamp or candle In examining these objects at tentively I discovered that three of these rays were far nlore conspi cuous than the others and were equidistant fromn each other and that one of them was directed vertically upward Among the heavenly bodies this was more conspicuous in the larger and brighter planets and in the fixed stars of the first magnitude By repeating similar observations on luminous objects at less dis tances as the flames of lamps and candles at distances varying from a few feet to several hundred it was found that the dilatations in those determinate directions were by no means confined to the narrow faint and elongated radiations which constitute the more obvious features of the stellar appearance but that the body of the flame itself assumed a distinctly triangular figure in consequence of a dilatation in precisely the same three directions In order to divest the results of any influence produced by the ac tual figure of the flame as well as to deternmine the effect of different magnitudes a circular metallic plate was mounted on an horizontal axis with liberty of motion in a vertical plane at right angles to the visual ray and pierced with unequial circular holes disposed in a circle con centric with the axis by the occasional rotation of the plate these were stuecessively brought between the eye and the flame very near the latter and their successive projections upon it afforded luminous objects perfectly circular Different wires meeting at the centre of the aperture and stretched in a plane parallel to and near the disk and furnished with movable beads afforded a simple instrument for determining the direction and extent of the irradiation though the  To the well known radiated appearance especially that of the sun the Latin writers applied the term coma Hence sol auricomus the sun with golden radiationsON IRRADIATION 343 determination of the latter has not as yet been attempted with much precision but was found as might be expected to increase with the intensity of the light With this apparatus the preceding results were verified and others obtained At a distance of from five to fifty feet the luminous object actually circular presented the appearance of an equilateral triangle whose outlines were pretty well defined especially when the metallic disk was illuminated oni the side next the eye by another candle in order to render the retina insensible to the extremities of the narrow and especially the irregular radiations At greater distances the aper ture being of the same magnitude the narrow radiations became more conspicuous the regular ones always predominating An increase in the magnitude of the object increases the distance requisite to produce the distinct triangular appearance With an object onetenth of an inich in diameter it is most distinctly seen at the distance of six or eight feet with one of onefifth of an inch at twelve or fifteen feet It is also seen pretty distinctly at double these distances respectively and with large objects at a great and probably indefinite number of miles provided their angular nmagnitude is sufficiently great to prevent the preponderance of the narrow rays and yet not so great as to ren der this change in form imperceptible With an object whose light is originally faint or rendered so by traversing a great extent of at mosphere the effect is less and may become insensible The foregoing experiments were varied and the principal results verified by viewing opaque objects surrounded by luminous ones instead of luminous ones surrounded by an opaque one as before A single example may suffice A circular opaque disk projected on the flame of a candle but extending beyond it laterally appeared deprived of two superior obliquie segments by downward and oblique dilatations of the superior part of the flame in the same directions as in the former ex periments also of a kind of sector at the inferior part by the upward vertical dilatation of the inferior part of the flame In consequence of the encroachment of the flame upon the disk in these three direc tions as the observer receded from it the disk was reduced in magni tude and changed in form and finally by the encroachment of the inferior portion of the flame by upward irradiation was divided into344 ON IRRADIATION two lateral portions This was in exact accordance with preceding results The experiments hitherto related have at my request been since repeated by others and their verification in almost every instance establishes the following general law There are determinate directions of maximum irradiation for every individtual these in man for ordi nary vision are generally three in number and are at equal angular distances and consequently one hundred and twenty degrees or one third of the circumference of the circle one direction being in the erect position of the head directly upward in a vertical visual plane passing through the centre of the luminous object the other two directions ob liquely downward in visual planes wvhich respectively make angles with theformer and with each other of one hundred and twenty degrees the decrements of dilatation in other directions are nearly symmetrical and equal with respect to these three directions and the apparent form of the object approximates more or less to that of an equilateral trian gle according to its brightness distance and magnitude Figures 1 2 and 3 represent the apparent forms of an opaque circu lar body projected upon a luminous one and 4 5 and 6 those of a luminious circular body projected upon or surrounded by a dark one 1 2 3 4 5 6 In these last as well as in the former experiments the dilatation increased with the distance it also increased with the intensity of the light In fact on this last account a straight horizontal rod by the apparent curvature of its lower edge when projected on the flame of a candle becomes a tolerably delicate photoscope for detect ing the less degree of illumination of the interior of the flame at heights above the base where the difference between the interior and exterior brightness is inappreciable by direct and simple observation During the experiments with the circular luminous objects when the head of the observer was inclined to the right or left any number of degrees the vertices of the luminous triangle as also the long radiaON IRRADIATION 345 tions were found to undergo a change of absolute position exactly cor respondent in direction and extent with that of the head wlhilst their relative position remained invariable This proved that the phenome non depended on no cause exterior to the human body When an opaque substance was interposed between either eye separately and the object the triangular appearance was preserved but the inferior ver tex was more obtuse and the oblique radiation shorter on the side of the eye whose vision was obstructed This proved that the effect de pended in part but not chiefly upon the combined action of the two organs Moreover as the appearance was unaffected by the careful removal of the ciliae and eyelids from before the cornea and as I had long since examined the separate effect of the tears it appeared evident that irradiation depended upon none of the tutamina oculi but was to be referred either to the refracting or sentient parts of the proper or gan of vision Several considerations seemed to me to exclude the latter If a vivid impression on any spot of the retina could produce a similar af fection of adjacent parts there is no obvious reason why this sympa thetic affection should be more widely diffused in certain determinate directions which sustain no possible constant relation to the distribu tion of its fibres or to its structure in any respect directions which are constant both in the case of oblique and of direct vision and on what ever part of the retina the image may be situated with respect either to the optic nerve or the centre of its medullary and membranous ex pansion The views which were suggested by considerations of this nature were confirmed by subsequent experiments experiments which proved the phenomenon under consideration to be independent of any peculiarity in the sensation and the retina to have no share in its pro duction in any other sense than as it is essential to vision in general When most of the preceding experiments had been made I for the first time thought of the striking coincidence between this dilatation of luminous bodies in three equidistant directions and the three equi distant sets of fibres and three equidistant radiated lines exhibited in the front view of the crystalline lens of the ox as represented by that eminent philosopher the late lamented Thomas Young MD in his VOL IV4 M346 ON IRRADIATION Observations on Vision He afterwards learned that these three sets had been previously seen though less accuratelv observed by Leeuwenhoek Dr Young describes each coat as consisting  Of six series of fibres intermixed with a gelatinous substance and attached to six lines which have somewhat of a membranous appearance Three of these lines or tendons are anterior three posterior their arrange ment is that of three equal andl equidistant rays meeting in the axis of the crystalline He adds  I have not yet had an opportunity of ex amining the human crystalline but from its readily dividing into three parts we may infer that it is similar to that of the ox Here I con ceived I had found a clue to the cause of the phenomienon in a struc ture which seemed calculated to produce an action symmetrical with respect to three equidistant radii of the crystalline lens a structure to which there appears to be nothing analogous in any other part of the organ of vision The deviations from this arranigement of the fibres which may have been detected by Dr Young and others will not be at present consideredt and wTill not probably affect the proof of a con nection between irradiation and the structure of the crystalline so long as there exists the more obvious division of this bodly into three similar sphenoidalportions In the prosecution of these researches on the subject of irradiationi I have made several other experiments especially with the pupil preter naturally dilated These will not be at present detailed but reserved for a future communication I shall however venture to state some of the inferences which they appear to justify which are the following 1 That irradiation is produced directly and chiefly by the crystal line lens but affected by the iris 2 That the different fasciculi of the fibres of the crystalline exert in some respects a similar though  Youngs Natural Philosophy Vol II p 525 t The greater number of fasciculi which Dr Young subsequently detected and their occa sional diversity and irregularity may perhaps explain the existence of intermediate radiations in all eyes and the absence of one of the more conspicuous and regular ones in some rare instances But I shall not venture to attempt an exact account of the optical and anatomical structure of the lens cornea and iris and their correspondence with the other laws of irradia tion which I may have discovered until I shall have had access to the papers of Dr Brewster and Sir E Home on the former subjects only a brief notice of which has been inserted in the scientific journalsON IRRADIATION 347 unequal action on light 3 That the central and lateral parts of this body conspire in different degrees to produce irradiation the effect increasing with the absolute distance of the incident ray from the axis of the crystalline and consequiently with the magnitude of the pupil 4 That there are two distinct species of irradiation in consequence of which the unequal lulminous border superadded to the perfect image on the retina by this kind of aberration is composed of two distinct though partially superimposed parts of different colours the superim posed portions of which on any one point of the retina are produced by the action of opposite wedges of the crystalline A popular application of the foregoing results is that we never see lumninotus objects of their true shape Of the existence of this species of optical illusion any person may readily convince himself by exam iniing the flame of a candle when near it and then withdrawing to the distance of thirty or forty feet or even across an ordinary room How frequienitly mrust we have been deceived in our estimate of form as well as magnitude It is unnecessary to dwell on the importance of being apprized of an illusion which affects in no small degree the testimony of one of our most interesting and valuable organs of sense We learn also from the results which I have obtained that the ap pearance of luminous objects with respect to position shape and occa sionally colour is materially affected by their brightness and distance and by the position of the head and the magnitude of the pupil or other aperture through which the rays are admitted into the eye and that these effects are constant for the same individual in the natural state of the eye and with few exceptions essentially the same for all Oni these principles we may probably explain the apparent projec tion of a star upon the moons disk at the time of an occultation a phenomenon whichi has occasionally astoniished the ordinary and acci dental observer and been c at all times an interesting and important subject to the astronomer to whom it has been perhaps scarcely less inexplicable It appears to me that irradiation affords a solution and that the laws I have detected may enable us to explain and even to predict the apparent anomalies viz its being more frequent in the  American Almanac for 1831 p 34348 ON IRRADIATION case of particular stars its not always existing in the occultations of the same star nor being seen by all individuals If this theory be correct the existence of this phenomenon and the distance to wvhich the star is thrown upon the moons disk depend upon the position of the head of the observer and the relative direction of the moon and star at the time of immersion or emersion The more frequent ap pearance of this phenomenon in the case of the brighter stars and on the luminous side of the disk seems to depend upon the greater dilata tion of the more luminous bodies whilst the duration will depend upon the magnitude of the star and the direction of the moons mo tion The effect of position will be understood from the following experiment in connection with the foregoing statements A circular opaque disk A was placed between the eye and a luminous circle of which a part projected beyond thed edge of the disk At a b and c the stellar or radia a K 0b ted appearance was most conspicuous on the disk whilst at d near the superior part it appeared more like a real luminous body on the disk of a reddish colour and well defined and almost or entirely projected oni it By inclining the head the places where these phenomena were most per fectly exhibited suffered a corresponding change their relative posi tion remaining invariable The appearance at a b and c is in accord ance with what has been herein stated with respect to the three directions of miaximum irradiation that at d will be explained by experiments which I had previously made on the human eye and which will be hereafter published with a generalization of the facts Among the other astronomical applications of the laws of irradiation the following may be mentioned Durinig a partial solar eclipse a faint light is sometimes seen to be thrown on the moon near the horis of the sun and to be brighter and longer on one side than on the other Moreover I have observed one of the horns of the new mooni though apparently not more luminous than the other to pro ject farther than the other from the dark portion of the disk according as they were situated with respect to the directions of maximum irra diation X Edinburgh Philosophical Journal Vol III p 393ON IRRADIATION 349 The fixed stars appear larger when viewed with the unassisted eye than when we employ a good achromatic telescope For a similar reason the planet Venus being from its vicinity to the sun strongly illuminated may appear larger than Jupiter to the eye whilst Jupiter appears larger than Venus with a telescope of such an aperture and magnifying power as to diminish the brightness and consequently the irradiation If the construction is such as to admit but a small pencil into the eye another cause will be found to conspire which is the less amount of irradiation and probably the different laws of it for the light which is transmitted near the axis of the crystalline lens This follows from the experiments already alluded to on the influence of aperture I shall not however at present anticipate any other results of those experiments on the influence of aperture on irradiation except to sug gest the possibility of applying them to the explanation of the twink ling of the stars a phenomenon hitherto entirely referred to causes purely physical but the true cause of which is admitted to be not fully ascertainedt As the fixed stars are highly brilliant bodies subtending an exceed ingly minute angle their apparent magnitudes depend almost entirely upon irradiation and it is hence easy to conceive that any alternate and transient changes in this affection may occasion oscillations in their images on the retina Is it not therefore possible that this phe nomeinon may be affected if not produced by transient remissions of irradiation If irradiation shall be shown to depend directly or indi rectly on the crystalline and iris it is possible that oscillatory motions in either might produce such remissions With respect to the exis tence of such motions Dr Wollaston has shown that muscular effort when apparently continuous consists in reality of a great number of contractions repeated at extremely short intervals It may be added that there are alternations of contraction and dilatation of the iris which are of sensible duration and extent and visible by direct observation  Or rather aplanatic free from both species of aberration t Youngs Natural Philosophy

Cylinders of a given Content considerd by Francis Blake Esq F R S THE fireengine or to term it more properly the steamengine for draining of mines is a masterpiece of machinery a very capital contrivance in the works of art and me riting our attention for further improvements This is universally allowed as well upon account of the theory it is founded on as its usefulness in practice And is it arrivd then at the last degree of perfection that we appear at a stand I think not The pro digious vessel of water to be kept always boiling when only an inconsiderable part of it is employd in the work savours too little of the frugality of nature which we ought ever to imitate But waving that now what I would inquire into here and endea vour to regulate is the cylinders proportion of the altitude and base which hath not as I know of been hitherto noticed It Read May 23 1751198 It is evident in the first place from a fundamen tal law of mechanics that the content of the cylin der remaining the same the quantity of water dis charged at each lift will in all cases be equal by only changing the distance of the center of the piston from the fulcrum of the balance You will agree like wise for I suppose the principles and workingpart to want no description that the excess of the pillar of atmosphere above that of the water is a weight on the piston driving it to a depth of five feet or there about by the present construction withinthe cavity of the cylinder acceleratedly till friction and an im pediment from the steam which remains in the cy linder even after the jet deau and is increased in elasticity whilst its bounds are diminishd shall equal the accelerative force and that then again the piston is retarded the rest of the way It may be convenient to remark too that if the rarefaction be so complete that the descent would be greater than the construc tion admits of the retardation is augmented by a brachium of the balance pressing upon springs But to say nothing of friction here we can notwith standing this diminution of force by the remainder of steam within the cavity of the cylinder demon strate the ratio of the velocities and the times of descent of the pistons in cylinders of unequal alti tudes to be exactly the same as if the resistance was nothing whence we shall without difficulty ar rive at some conclusion in this matter MN is the workingpart of a steamengine cylin der of the usual height equal in diameter to a shorter one m n and the rarefaction in both of them being supposed the same AQaq RQrq and199 and ARar may represent the excess of the atmo spheres weight above the pillar of water the resist ance to the pistons from the remainder of steam and the effective force respectively e g at the beginning of the descent Take then everywhere ak AK an AN and at all similar positions the resistance b c of m n and force k c on its piston will equal the resistance BC of MN and force KC on its piston and by what Sir Isaac Newton has demonstrated Book 1 Prop 39 of the descent of bodies we have akcr AKCR celerity in k celerity in K But these areas being evidently as the corresponding pa rallelograms kq and KQ and they again as their heights the celerities generated are in the subdupli cate ratio of a k A K as tho the resistance had been nothing and by an obvious enough reasoning from the said proposition the times also appear to be in the abovementiond ratio which ratio is not any way varied tho the resistance prevails from the in tersecting points O Now to apply what has been said to the business in hand if TW be a cylinder of equal content with the cylinder MN the quantity of water delivered by both will as a consequence of the fundamental law of mechanics observed above be the same at each lift but the cylinder TW is no higher than nm and ex hypoth their rarefactions are equal and therefore by what has been proved with regard to the times the time of the pistons descent in TW will be to that of the pistons descent in MN EW AN whence in any given time the broad cylinder TW will perform more than the longer one MN of equal content and that in the ratio of their diameters 4 for200 for   EW  MA2  AN ex hypoth EW AN  MA2 ET2 and consequently EW AN MA ET The friction too is diminished with the slowness of the motion and because the periphery increases in a less ratio than does the area of a circle The result of the whole then is in favour of the broad cylinder and still the broader the better for unless some mechanical considerations should limit the problem tis evident in a geometrical sense that there is no limitation A disadvantage might arise perhaps to the effect of the jet deau from thus in creasing the breadth which however would be re medied I think by a number of these jets but be that as it will tis certain that to augment the dia meters and diminish the lengths of the smaller kind of cylinders now used could have no such incon venience nor fail of being attended with an augmenta tion of force What I think might be further observed for the improvement of this engine is in the boiler and steam but more connected with experiments which should I have an opportunity to make I may resume perhaps the subject if they answer my expectation E T a r q m b c k o W n XXX201 A R Q M B K C O N XXX

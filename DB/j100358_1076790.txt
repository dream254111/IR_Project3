HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME MYRON W RICHARDSON Roxbury High School Boston Mass The importance of a good school programme cannot be overestimated It is to the school what the timetable is to the railroad and upon it largely depends not alone the economical management of the institution but its educational efficiency as well With the growth of the highschool curriculum has of neces sity come increased complexity in the school programme As long as all pupils took the same studies the programme was com paratively simple but as the number of studies multiplied it became impossible for any pupil to take them all and a choice of a part of them became a necessity At first certain courses such as the commercial course the classical course etc were arranged and a pupil selecting one or the other of these courses was expected to follow it without deviation to the end This resulted in the division of the school into a number of groups but the members of each group pursued exactly the same studies This change produced some change in the school programme but it was still comparatively simple It was found that the fixed courses of study did not ade quately meet the varied needs of the pupils needs which developed hand in hand with changes in our social and industrial life Fixed courses of study also made it almost impossible for a pupil to change from one course to another without beginning 449THE SCHOOL REVIEW over again The pupil for instance who had discovered himself after entering the high school and desired to change his work could not readily do so The next step in advance was to offer certain elective studies within the course The pupil still chose a given course of study but in the later years of the course was offered a choice of work from other courses of study A recent examination of courses of study in many high schools seems to show that most of the high schools of this country are now at this stage of develop ment i e they offer a number of courses of study with restricted election in the latter years of the course In I9OI the city of Boston one of whose high schools is used for illustrative purposes in this paper went one step farther threw down all the barriers offered by courses of study and with the exception of a few studies which were required of all pupils put all the rest into one elective group and offered free election to all pupils The accompanying elective sheet shows how great freedom of choice is now allowed in this city It will be noticed that English physical training or military drill choral practice and hygiene are required subjects but all others are elective Certain studies cannot be elected until certain years and there are certain broad requirements for a diploma designed to prevent unwise choice of work by pupils Otherwise pupils are free to choose as they please The pupil desiring a commercial course chooses from the list commercial subjects and the pupil fitting for college or technical school chooses the studies that he needs Should a pupil develop new ambitions he is at liberty at once to choose his work accordingly This change was a most radical one and there were found and still can be found teachers who believe that it was a great mistake that pupils entering the high school are too young to choose for themselves that they choose unwisely and follow as a rule lines of least resistance and that fixed courses of study or courses with limited election yielded better results I have never seen statistical information which confirmed these opinions It would be a fruitful field for investigation to gather 45oMAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME ELECTION OF STUDIESROXBURY HIGH SCHOOL NAME  NEXT YEARS CLASS ROOM COURSE  PRESCRIBED STUDIES ELECTIVE STUDIES u a Stuy Study Study cd4 g0 CS I

by the headmaster must include all the prescribed studies and a sufficient number of elective studies to amount all told to not less than nineteen nor more than twentytwo points each year In the fourth year all the pupils work is elective to a total of not less than seventysix points for the four years B A diploma is awarded to pupils who have won seventysix points which must include i six points in physical training or military drill 2 one point in hygiene 3 three points in choral practice 4 at least thirteen points in English 5 at least seven points in some foreign language or in phonography and typewriting 6 at least four points in mathematics or bookkeeping 7 at least three points in history 8 at least three points in science I approve of my childs selection of the above studies for the school year 9  to 19 Parents Signature 45ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW statistics of this kind from schools of varying degrees of free dom in election We are all of us prone to resist innovations and to value unduly practices with which we have long been familiar Because of these mental attitudes abuses in a new order of things loom large so large as often to hide advantages Personally I have witnessed a steady growth in judgment by pupils in the choice of their work and such abuses as I have seen have been largely due either to transition from the old to the new or to faults of administration a failure properly to inform and direct pupils in their choice of work The introduction of electives at once very greatly increased the difficulty of making the school programme Pupils must no longer be provided for in groups but as individuals and there were almost as many differences in elections as there were pupils The making of school programmes has never received in educational discussions the attention which it merits probably because of its very great complexity In every high school there are a host of considerations purely of a local nature that enter into the making of its programme The requirements of the course of study the personal characteristics of the teacher and his preparation to teach the size situation and number of avail able schoolrooms the coming and going of special teachers etc etc are all considerations which enter into the making of the school programme and yet are not alike in any two high schools There are however certain fundamental considerations that underlie all programme making which can be set forth and which are valuable It is proposed in this paper to bring out some of these considerations by treating in detail the making of the programme of a particular school but the principles involved have been successfully applied in a variety of other high schools in small as well as large schools in schools with restricted and schools with unlimited elections THE PROBLEM The Roxbury High School Roxbury District Boston is a mixed school of about 850 pupils 400 of them in the entering class The girls outnumber the boys about three to one There 452MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME is unrestricted election of studies Pupils can and do reach back and take first second or thirdyear studies in every subsequent year Some studies have recitations but once a week others two three four and five times per week Two hours in the week are devoted to military drill by all the boys one hour to choral practice by the pupils of the entering class another hour by pupils of the three upper classes During one hour known as the office hour the entire school is free Science subjects and drawing require one or more double periods for laboratory work The programme presents unusual difficulties as much so perhaps as will be found in any mixed high school anywhere The problem is to so arrange the programme of studies as to allow every pupil to choose what he wishes NUMBER OF RECITATION PERIODS PER DAY One of the first things to be determined in any school pro gramme is the number of recitations per day The length of the school session in most high schools is five hours Out of this must be taken about 30 minutes for the noon recess and at least 10 minutes for opening exercises This leaves 280 minutes per day for recitations How shall this time be divided It is usually divided either into six periods of from 40 to 45 minutes each or into five of 50 or more minutes each School regula tions usually require that every pupil shall carry work which employs on the average about twenty periods per week and the office hour employs one more With five recitation periods per day twentyone periods per week will then be employed out of a total of twentyfive This does not allow a sufficient margin of unemployed time to avoid conflict in the pupils programme Especially is this so if for any reason the pupil is obliged to carry extra work or needs extra periods for laboratory or shop work Six periods per day thirty per week is the more common divi sion of time and it allows a sufficient number of unemployed periods to give necessary flexibility in the pupils programme In the Roxbury High School the school session is extended fifteen minutes so that each recitation period may be exactly 45 minutes long 453THE SCHOOL REVIEW RECITATION GROUPS How shall these periods be utilized for recitations This is a very important consideration One of two plans is usually followed Recitations are either scheduled any time in the week that will avoid conflict and the programme thus forms what has been aptly called a mosaic or the periods of the week are divided into a number of nonconflicting recitation groups or blocks as they are sometimes called It is possible where there is restricted election and pupils schedules are therefore very much alike to arrange a programme on the mosaic plan without many conflicts but it will generally be found rigid and inflexible if a pupil chooses a course out of the ordinary and many a pupils worthy ambition has been nipped in the bud by the inexorable demands of such a pro gramme Moreover such a programme does not possess the quality of permanence It is so delicately put together that the changes in classes which of necessity come from year to year so derange the mosaic as to call for a new programme each year in the making of which the old programme is of very little help If however the recitation periods of the week are divided into a number of different groups which are of necessity non conflicting because they represent different periods of time reci tations may be assigned to different groups with no possibility of conflict changes from year to year may be provided for by minor changes in the group distribution and such grouping may be improved upon and perfected as time goes on so as to be wellnigh permanent The number of periods in a recitation group will vary accord ing to the requirements of the Course of Study In the Rox bury High School the thirty recitation periods of the week are divided into six groups of four periods each and a seventh group of six periods Four periods constitute a recitation group because more subjects have four recitations per week than any other number To the six recitation groups are assigned all or nearly all recitations The seventh group is used for irregular recita 454MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME tions requiring often special teachers such as military drill or choral practice for the office hour and for laboratory work or extra recitations If a subject requires four or less recitations per week it is assigned to one of the six groups If it requires five recitations per week or double periods for laboratory work these are provided for by combining the group with some period in the seventh group How shall these six recitation groups be chosen This is by no means a simple problem The natural choice would be to have four of the first recitation periods of each day constitute the first group four of the second the second group etc but such a choice means that to some subjects will be assigned all of the first periods of the day and to others all of the last periods It is a wellestablished fact in pedagogy that there is a great difference in the working efficiency of a pupil in the first and last hours of the day and that subjects assigned to the last hours are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with those assigned to the early hours Especially is this noticeable if they happen to be different divisions of the same subject The selection of the seventh group is largely determined by the peculiarities of the group itself the coming and going of special teachers etc It should therefore be the first chosen and around it should be arranged the other six groups in such a way as to provide for an equal distribution of early and late periods and for combina tion with the seventh group for extra recitations and double laboratory periods The accompanying blank shows how these groups have been arranged in the Roxbury High School Other schools would require a different grouping but the principles involved would apply to all schools The number in the lower righthand corner of each space indicates the group to which the period has been assigned The periods themselves are designated as first second third etc period of the day Group I includes the 5th period Monday the 5th Tuesday the 2nd Wednesday and the Ist Friday

combinations can be made by girls only but as our girls outnumber the boys three to one some divisions are made up wholly of girls Other combinations 456MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME between the six groups are possible and are used in the entering class where the number of classes reciting five times per week is large ELECTION OF STUDIES BY PUPILS The success of the elective system depends upon the wise and careful direction of pupils in their choice of work Time should be allowed for the teacher to advise with the pupil and fully inform him about the different subjects offered and parents should be invited to consult with teachers in the matter Obviously this cannot be done if election is deferred until the beginning of the school year when there are so many other things to be attended to Pupils in the three upper classes should elect their work for the ensuing school year not later than June I I know of no reason why if elections are made in May both the school programme and the pupils individual programmes cannot be made out in the summer vacation and the pupil be given his assignment of classes on the opening day of school so that he may be ready for work the second day Because they come from many different grammar schools the entering class had better defer their elections until they enter the high school in September when they will receive uniform instructions and supervision by highschool teachers This need not however interfere with the making of the school programme during the summer vacation The size of the entering class is approxi mately known in June and by means of data from previous entering classes the number of divisions in each subject may be estimated fairly well It will be found that the percentage of pupils in entering classes electing each subject varies very little from year to year The elective blank used in the Roxbury High School and given above see p 451 has been in successful use for two years It designates prescribed and elective studies indicates in the two columns to the left the year when subjects may first be elected and the number of years they may be pursued and leaves two blank columns to the right one for the indication of the year of the subject desired and the other for the number of points that it 457THE SCHOOL REVIEW counts Under the head of General Directions are found the requirements of the course of study as laid down by the school authorities and at the bottom of the page is a place for the parents approval of his childs selection of work The parents approval should always be obtained He is the most interested party and his signature acts to prevent whimsical and unreason able changes in elections by the pupil in the fall of the year TABULATION OF ELECTIVES The pupils elective sheets should next be carefully tabulated to ascertain the number electing each subject and from these tabulations can be computed the number of recitation divisions for the ensuing year If for no other purpose than for this tabulation a printed elective blank is desirable Without it the pupils electives are in his own hand writing and in no definite order With it the electives are printed and appear each at a definite place on the blank where they can instantly be recog nized in the tabulations and retabulations that are necessary before the programme is completed DISTRIBUTION OF DIVISIONS AMONG RECITATION GROUPS After the number of divisions has been determined they must be distributed among the different recitation groups so as to avoid conflict Upon the skill with which this is done more than upon any other one element depends the success of the programme Care must be taken to avoid conflicts both on the part of the teacher by not placing in the same group two divisions taught by the same teacher and on the part of the pupil by not placing in the same group two divisions desired by the same pupil Two directions of general application may be given with reference to this distribution First Avoid as far as possible placing in the same group sub jects with but one division unless the subjects themselves are nonconflicting Different years of the same subject e g Latin I and II or Algebra I and II are of themselves nonconflicting and may appear in the same group Our course of study does not allow pupils in the entering class to elect more than one 458MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME foreign language This makes foreign languages of the same year e g Latin I and French I or German II and French II nonconflicting Some studies are nonconflicting by nature e g the higher courses in Latin or Greek and the higher courses in commercial branches are rarely chosen by the same pupil and may be placed with little probability of conflict in the same recitation group Other requirements of the course of study might be cited which would tend to make other studies non conflicting Second When there is more than one division of a subject give the different divisions the widest possible distribution i e if the number of divisions be less than the number of groups do not allow two divisions to come in the same recitation group if the number be more than the number of groups but not more than twice as many do not allow over two divisions to come in a group etc Such a distribution gives very great flexibility for the assignment of work both to teacher and to pupil It may be desirable before the grouping is finally settled to consult the elective sheets of pupils in the highest class because in the last year of the course there are so many subjects with single divi sions but this will hardly be necessary for the three lower classes ALPHABETICAL DESIGNATION OF DIVISIONS After all of the divisions have been distributed among the recitation groups there should be some comprehensive designation of divisions The method of designation described below is one of the distinctive features of this school programme It is so simple that it can readily be understood by pupil and teacher and it can be used equally well by schools with restricted or schools with free election All studies are classified as first second or thirdyear studies according to the year when they can first be elected Each class in the school is divided into equal alphabetically ar ranged sections In the three upper classes about 35 pupils and in the entering class 25 pupils are assigned to a section These sections are designated by the letters of the alphabet section a 459THE SCHOOL REVIEW being the alphabetically first 35 or 25 pupils section b the alphabetically second etc Thus in the Roxbury High School for the present year Class IV is divided into two such sections called a and b Class III into five sections designated by the letters a to e Class II into six sections designated by letters a to f and Class I into twelve sections designated by letters a to I Class II may be selected for illustrative pur poses It consists of 205 pupils and is divided into six sections five with 34 pupils each and one with 35 designated as Sections a b c d e and f Since English is required of all pupils in Class II each of these alphabetical sections constitutes a recitation division in English known as English II a English II b etc Of the 205 pupils in Class II a little over one hundred elected French II This is about one pupil out of two and it would therefore take two of the equal alphabetical sections to yield a sufficient number of pupils to form one recitation division in French II and such a division is accordingly designated by two letters of the alphabet French II af cd or be the letters indicating the source of its pupils Again only a third of the pupils elected Latin II and therefore three alphabetical sections would be necessary to yield sufficient pupils to form a Latin II division which is called Latin II abc or def In like manner every division is designated by one or more letters of the alpha bet the subjects with the fewer divisions having the larger num ber of letters and the letters in every case indicating the alpha betical sections from which the pupils came It there is but one division in a subject no letters at all are used Three very important things may be accomplished by this method of designating divisions First It tends to make divisions of the same kind equal in size Since the basis of this method is the equal alphabetical section and since each recitation division of a given kind draws its pupils from as nearly as possible the same number of sections it follows that the divisions themselves should be about equal in size Second It directs the pupil in his choice of divisions and enables him if necessary to make out his own programme A 460MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME pupil in alphabetical section a chooses only recitation divisions designated by a pupils in section b only those designated by b etc Third These letters may be used to avoid conflict within recitation groups Since each letter represents an entirely differ ent section of pupils it follows that there can be no conflict within a recitation group unless letters are repeated Such repetition is therefore avoided as far as possible in designating studies of the same year within a group An illustration will make this clear The following divisions of firstyear subjects occur in one recitation group English I g English I h physical train ing I def history I ab French I bc German I abc algebra I jk bookkeeping I i bookkeeping I j The letters have been chosen so as to avoid repetition as far as possible It will be noticed that the letter a is repeated in history I and German I The pupils then of alphabetical section a who happen to take these two subjects would have a conflict They would retain German I because there are fewest divisions of this study and seek another history I division The method of widest distribution has placed one or more history I divisions in every recitation group and no difficulty will be found in finding one Letters b and c are repeated in French I and German I but there is no conflict here because pupils cannot elect both of these languages in their enter ing year The letter j is repeated in algebra I and bookkeep ing I but there is slight chance of conflict here because pupils rarely elect these two subjects in the same year No other letters of the twelve alphabetical sections into which the entering class is divided are repeated and there is therefore no other possibility of conflict This principle of avoiding conflicts by avoiding as far as possible the repetition of letters within a group has been carried throughout the entire programme It is of very great importance in the lowest classes but of decreasing importance as you go upward for two reasons First because of the in creasing number of studies in the higher classes with but one division and second because of the increasing number of pupils who reach back and elect studies of previous years There are then two distinct methods of avoiding conflict 46ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW in this programme one by having six nonconflicting recitation groups which may be called a horizontal variable and the other by avoiding alphabetical repetition within the group which may be called a vertical variable Given these two variables there are many different ways in which every pupils programme may be arranged If one arrangement causes a conflict another can easily be found which avoids it In the entering class 25 instead of 35 is taken as the number in an alphabetical section for two reasons First because it is desirable that recitation divisions in this class be smaller than those in the three upper classes and second because it is always difficult accurately to forecast in June the number of pupils who will enter in September It very often happens that a programme carefully made out during the summer fails to work in Septem ber because of an unexpectedly large entering class and conse quent extra recitation divisions If 25 is taken as a basis each division can increase to 35 without serious harm the more so because in this class it is likely to decrease to 30 or less before January i An increase from 25 to 35 means an allowance for an increase of 40 per cent in the entering class Even this large increase could be accommodated without the formation of a new division because the extra pupils would evenly distribute themselves among the various alphabetical divisions already established As an example in hand the programme for the Roxbury High School was made out last summer on the basis of 300 pupils in the entering class but nearly 400 entered These pupils were accommodated without the formation of an extra division PUPILS INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMES It has already been stated that for the three upper classes time and confusion at the beginning of the school year would be saved if each pupils individual programme could be made out during the summer and given to him when he entered in the fall Under many conditions this would be a tremendous and wellnigh im possible task to accomplish With a programme made upon the plan of this one however it can be done by the expenditure on 462MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME the average of not over a minute to a programme and it is well worth this expenditure of time Two illustrations will make my meaning clear Etta A Gore Class III elects Groups Changed Groups English III 3 6 Physical training II  I 4 Choral practice  7 French I  5 3 German III  5 Household arts and science I i This is a difficult programme to arrange because the pupil has reached back and chosen two studies and in other ways her selection of work is peculiar Every teacher is provided with duplicated sheets showing the group recitation periods and room for every division and the alphabetical sections for each class Reference to these sheets shows that this pupil belongs in alphabetical section b All of her recitation divisions then must be designated by the letter b and against each of her electives is placed the group number of the b division of the same as indicated above It will be seen that two of her recitations French I and German III come in the same recitation group 5 and therefore conflict German III is retained because there is but one division in this subject and another French I division is sought To arrange it the group assignments of two other electives must be changed as indicated above As finally arranged her group numbers read 6 4 7 3 5 i This programme is now ready to be made out on one of the blanks as given above by the pupil himself or better still by the teacher to be handed to the pupil when he enters school In the next example the alphabetical section is found to be e and the group numbers of the e divisions in the different electives to be as indicated Two numbers 7 and 2 are re peated There is no conflict in group 7 because Military Drill and Choral Practice do not come at the same time There is a conflict in group 2 but another Hygiene division is found in group 6 His group numbers as finally arranged read 5 7 7 6 463THE SCHOOL REVIEW 4 I 2 There is no repetition of group numbers other than 7 and therefore no conflict possible As soon as one is familiar with group distributions the placing of these group numbers against each elective and the necessary changes in the same can be done very rapidly Harold Mitchell Class II elects Groups Changed Groups English II 5 M ilitary drill  7 Choral practice  7 Hygiene  2 6 French II  4 Bookkeeping II Phonography I 2 With the entering class this cannot be done until the opening day of school but there are always many divisions of every first year subject and conflicts are very easily avoided It is possible on the opening day for pupils of this class to choose their studies and make out their own programmes and on the second day to bring their parents approval of their choice and be ready for work Before leaving this subject it should be stated that the funda mental assumption of this programme is that all divisions in a given subject should be taught alike It ignores for example such a thing as a college division in algebra and another division in the same subject for pupils who are not going to college or special classes in English for commercial pupils and other classes for other pupils It assumes that algebra or English if taught at all should be taught equally well to all pupils How often you see in high schools small college preparatory divisions to which are assigned the best teachers and the largest number of recitations and which can be carried only at the cost of larger classes and poorer teaching in other divisions of the same sub ject Such a distribution of the teaching force is not only not economical from a financial standpoint but it is unjust to a large number of pupils and it tends to create undesirable class dis 464MAKING A HIGHSCHOOL PROGRAMME tinctions in the school More than that the formation of special classes of this kind greatly decreases the flexibility of the pro gramme and increases the difficulty of programme making The natural the economical and the equable way to meet special demands of this kind is to fit the pupil as far as possible in the regular class and to assign extra periods for whatever extra work may be necessary EQUALIZATION OF DIVISIONS It has already been stated that the plan of this programme tends to keep equal in size recitation divisions of the same kind Some exceptions to this will be found however for two reasons First because in adjusting conflicts divisions sometimes gain or lose unequally and second because it is not always possible to assign the same number of letters to each division In Class II referred to above there were enough pupils elected phonography I to form four divisions There are but six alpha betical sections in Class II and four is not an equal divisor of six For this reason two of the divisions in phonography I were designated by two letters each and twol by one letter each The twoletter divisions would be larger than the one and would have to be equalized To accomplish this equalization after the pupils programmes have been indicated they should be tabulated once more by di visions This is not a difficult task and once accomplished the size of every division in the three upper classes is known and equalization can be made merely by changing group numbers on the pupils elective sheet CONCLUSIONS The present programme has been in use in the Roxbury High School for two years With no restrictions upon elections other than the general ones already spoken of the programme allowed this year 99 per cent of the electives of Class IV the highest class 995 per cent of Class III Ioo per cent of Class II and Ioo per cent of Class I and 997 per cent of the electives of the entire school Almost as good a showing was made the year before 465THE SCHOOL REVIEW During the first year of its trial it also provided instruction for an increased number of pupils with one less teacher than was employed the year before Both years the school began its regular programme the second day of the school year instead of the second or third week a saving of time which if applied to the entire teaching force would be nearly equivalent to a years teaching by one teacher A summary of the fundamental elements in the making of a good school programme should include First The division of the school week into such a number of recitation periods that the pupil with an average programme shall have a sufficient number of unemployed periods to avoid conflicts in his choice of work Thirty periods is better than twentyfive for this purpose Second The division of these recitation periods into a certain number of nonconflicting recitation groups Third The arrangement of these groups so as to equally distribute early and late periods of the day and to provide for necessary extra or double laboratory periods Fourth The election of studies for the ensuing year by pupils of the three upper classes not later than June I Fifth The tabulation of the pupils electives and the esti mation of the number of recitation divisions Sixth The distribution of these recitation divisions among the recitation groups in such a way as to avoid conflict on the part of both the teacher and the pupil Seventh The designation of these recitation divisions in such a way as to guide the pupil in his choice of divisions to insure equality in the size of divisions of like kind and to avoid conflict within the recitation group Eighth The indication of the individual programmes of all pupils in the three upper classes before they enter school in the fall Ninth A tabulation of pupils electives by divisions and an equalization of divisions of like kind Tenth The preparation in duplicate for use by teachers of such copies of the programme as may be necessary to direct new pupils in their choice of work 466

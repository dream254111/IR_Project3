ROTHROCK Member of State Forestry Reservation Commission West Chester Pa Before its settlement by white men Pennsylvania was practically covered by a dense forest growth The few lakes and the river beds were almost the only portions which were unshaded from the direct rays of the sun In this primeval forest the shade was dense enough to keep the soil constantly in a more or less moist condition and the atmosphere during most of the year was at or near the point of saturation Two hundred and eightysix years have completely changed the appearance of the states surface and so reduced the timber supply that Pennsylvania has already long ceased to produce enough for her own wants That so great a change should have taken place in so short a period is surprising though it is easily accounted for In order to encourage settlement of the country land patents were granted by the state for the nominal sum of twentysix and twothirds cents an acre It was not even necessary that the pur chaser should be a settler This condition of affairs continued until MIarch 28 I905 when an act was passed which authorized the State Forestry Commission to decide whether any tract to which the state still held title should be sold or passed over to the Forestry Com mission and become a part of the State Forest Reserve From March 30 I897 the commonwealth has been buying back its lands usually with the timber removed often at a larger price than it received for them whilst the timber was still upon them The act of I905 ended this folly Timber so cheaply purchased was often sold at a slight advance in price The consequence was that lumber ing operations were unduly stimulated Men were content to cut and sell at a price which left but a small margin of profit Anterior even to the development of the lumber industry came the removal of our forests to make room for agriculture and to pro 252Forestry Policy of Pennsylvania vide homes for the farmers The earliest settlements were natu rally in the hardwood regions of the eastern part of the state There were extensive forests of various species of oak and hickory Chest nut yellow poplar black walnut elm white ash basswood and other valuable trees were common and often attained large size I remember when the timber was removed by fire from ground that was to be converted into a farm There was no market for it Farm land was needed above all else for the young couple starting in life No one questioned the motive then No one does now except to say that it would have been a wiser thing to have cleared less ground and to have farmed it better The crop would probably have been as large The richness of the soil the ease with which it could be reached absence of Indian wars in the early history of the colony all hastened the early settlement of the eastern end of the state Shipbuilding interests drew upon the splendid white oaks and also upon the white pines from the mountains Our timber was exported to the West Indies and went also by way of the Ohio River to build homes in states to the west of us Later there were three sawmills in the state that combined required annually the product of seven thousand acres of land averaging thirty thousand feet board measure of lumber per acre that is nearly eleven square miles The prevailing timber west of the Allegheny River was hard wood as in the eastern part of Pennsylvania but the conebearing trees pine and hemlock characterized the central mountain axes Associated with these however especially in the northern counties were beech two kinds of birch black cherry and much valuable hard maple The lands cleared for lumber have as a rule been left in a deplorable conditionfor the most part they have been practically abandoned by the owners and given over to forest fires These are the lands which have been purchased by the commonwealth for for estry purposes but before considering the economic relation of these impoverished lands a word may be offered concerning some of the farm lands At a moderate estimate it would be safe to say that there are in Pennsylvania today a million acres that are classed as farm lands simply because agriculture is attempted upon them but which barely produce the food required by a family and enough to spare for pur 253 37The Annals of the American Academy chase of raiment These lands are becoming poorer each year and must sooner or later go into the list of abandoned farms Remunerative agriculture upon them is hopeless under exist ing conditions and wellnigh hopeless under any conditions that we may reasonably anticipate Living upon them as farms leads to a low form of citizenship As cleared lands they will inevitably become poorer If restored to forest growth the tendency would be for the soil to improve and eventually we might expect that they would be covered with merchantable timber of good quality The class of grounds to which I now allude are the steep hill sides where a sandy or shaly soil is found It is fairly an open ques tion whether it would not be better for the owner and his family to plant his ground out in young timber trees and earn his living by some other mode than farming such land If an industrious man he would almost certainly earn a more comfortable living This leads to the question what can the state do towards assist ing in the restoration of such ground to a productive condition First it could furnish the seedling trees To this it is practically already committed Second it could alter its present system of taxation so as to make it possible for the land owner to attempt the policy of reforestation which can be plainly shown to be as much in the interest of the state as of the land owner So far as we now see it will not be possible for the common wealth to obtain by purchase all the land it should have to ensure its own prosperous perpetuity and to guard against the disastrous conditions which inevitably follow upon excessive deforestation In addition it may be safely stated that there are six million acres of land in Pennsylvania of an absolutely nonagricultural char acter upon which there has been no attempt at farming Most of this land is held by individuals or corporations Some of it may be used for grazing but the time is certainly far distant when farming will be attempted upon it It is essential under any circumstances that all of this six million acres should at once be placed under forest cover To allow it to remain in its present con dition will be ruinous because wash of soil from its surface will induce a desert condition There are already vast areas now in this state which have become so hopelessly barren that it will require the expenditure of enormous sums to restore the ground to a productive 254 38Forestry Policy of Pennsylvania condition Yet these very areas once produced a dense growth of valuable white pine and hemlock The exhaustion of timber in our state has been caused more by excessive taxation than by any real demand for lumber If forest owners could have seen any coming relief from taxation they would have been glad to hold their resources for the future and only enough would have been cut to meet actual needs and for this a fair payment would have been made Regulation of cutting by a trust even would have been helpful There seems to be but one remedy for this condition of affairs Sixteen years ago attention was called to it by the present writer in the statement So long as land remains in the condition known as timber land the owner or owners thereof should pay no taxes upon it except in so far as he or they derive an actual revenue from it If the statement had been modified so as to read should pay no taxes upon the timber except in so far as he or they derive an actual revenue from it there would have been a practical accord with the newborn thesis of the National Conservation Association which demands the separation for purposes of taxation of the timber from the land on which it grows so that the forest crop shall be taxed only when it is harvested while the land shall be taxed every year It may be stated as an indication of the advanced relation of Pennsylvania to the forestry problem that a bill was introduced at the last legislature to create out of lands owned by individuals or cor porations auxiliary forest reserves to be practically under the direc tion of the State Department of Forestry The land of these reserves was to be assessed for taxation at a maximum of one dollar an acre The timber was to remain untaxed until cut when the owner or owners were to pay an income tax of seventyfive cents for each thousand feet of coniferous timber cut and fifty cents for each thou sand feet of other timber cut The bill failed of passage but its reception was such as to indicate passage of it or of a similar bill in the near future Of these lands now owned in Pennsylvania by individuals or by corporations it may be safely said that if they are to be made again productive and useful the state must either purchase them outright or the tax must be removed from the timber whilst it is maturing There seems to be no other solution in sight 255 39The An7nals of the Amnerican Academy As a state Pennsylvania has made a notable start in forestry by the purchase of 916375 acres of nonagricultural land which is set apart as a perpetual forest reserve and which cannot be sold or in any way alienated from the purpose for which it was intended For planting all suitable land within this area three nurseries have been established in which there are now millions of forest tree seedlings growing which will be planted as fast as ready for removing Pennsylvania has had for several years a State Forest Academy located at Mont Alto in which young men are educated at state expense for the public forestry service Admission to this school can be gained only after a rigid competitive examination On the average there are about sixty applicants each year and from this number the ten who have passed the best mental and physical exam ination are accepted after they have given satisfactory bond in the sum of five hundred dollars to remunerate the state for money expended upon them if they are dismissed for misconduct failure to pass examinations or for failure to promptly obey orders In addition to this forest academy there is now a large class engaged in the study of forestry at the State College where a highly satisfactory curriculum has been established On the whole Penn sylvania has made a creditable record in forestry It is a matter of pride that her example has served as a stimulus to some other states All that has been done here however has led to a keener appre ciation of liow much remains undone For example for the state to plant and properly protect less than twenty million forest tree seedlings each year is simply to trifle with a great pressing problem If we were to plant a thousand such seedlings to the acre the number above given would cover but little more than five and onehalf miles square out of an area probably fifty times as great within this state and on which there exists a no less urgent need of immediate forest protection The ground is hilly on a large part of the land owned by the state and the soil is generally of the loose sort which washes away most rapidly when deprived of its forest cover It would not be difficult to point out areas in Pennsylvania which are capable of supporting from five to six hundred families and which have been abandoned after lumbering These areas have been swept by fire so often that no useful growth remains on them to protect the surface against the inevitable wash which is rapidly transforming them into 256 40Forestry Policy of Pennsylvania actual deserts Eventually the reclamation of such areas will become a public necessity but the cost then if stated now would stagger belief The only wise economical thing to do is for the state to purchase such lands and to place them under care at once It is an enormous problem but it must be done sooner or later in order that our increasing population may have occupation food and homes The longer it is delayed the more it will cost Wherever our polit ical system rises to the dignity of statesmanship these facts will be recognized It is for our State Forest Reservation Commission to place the problem fully and urgently before our general assembly and put the responsibility of providing the means unequivocally upon that body The duty of the commission is to buy land and the duty of the state is to provide for its care It is high time that the demands of all less fundamental interests upon the state treasury were relegated to the rear until this preservation of the soil of the commonwealth is attended to for out of it and of it alone our pros perity must come From another point of view forestry merits consideration I presume no one will dispute the proposition that a nation cannot be stronger than the aggregate of its citizens It seems equally indis putable that of our people other things being equal those who live most in the open are the most free from debilitating disease and are least dependent upon the public for charitable support When we consider that a month or two of open air life allowed to those who are confined in badly ventilated apartments whether factory or office often saves a hopeless breakdown and a prolonged or final absence from productive occupation with probably the need of sup port in a charitable institution the conclusion seems inevitable that it is cheaper wiser and more humane to prevent than to cure dis ease Fifty years of observation confirms me in this belief This leads to the inquiry whether it is not worth the attention of our legislators to consider ways and means of leading our ailing citizens into camp life under proper restrictions on the State For est Reserves in the hope that it would diminish the now wise and necessary expenditure for almshouses and sanatoria The idea is not wholly new as it was worked out to a triumphant success at Mont Alto before the camp developed under the wise direction of Dr Dixon into a great sanatorium for the treatment of tuberculosis It may as well be added that a bill looking toward such a plan was 257 4IThe Annals of the American Academy introduced at the last legislature assigned to the committee on appropriations and perished there before being allowed a chance on the floor of the house It needs no prophetic eye to recognize that the trend of events will lead to the adoption of some such plan in a not distant future The following figures received by the courtesy of the State Department of Forestry seem important and should accompany the foregoing discussion FIRE LOSSES IN I908

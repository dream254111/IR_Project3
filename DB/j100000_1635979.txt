at least with out change The European delegates have brought with them from their own labora tories a quantity of apparatus and chemicals in order that they may reproduce work done in their own laboratories at the Bureau of Standards as accurately as possible Stand ard cells will be set up by the representatives of each of the four institutions and accu rately compared and tested In the same way different forms of silver voltameters will be operated in series with one another and the quantity of silver deposited in each determined with very great accuracy The Bureau of Standards has provided every facility for carrying on this work expeditiously and with the highest precision The three European delegates arrived from Europe recently and proceeded to Washing ton after a short stay in New York in time to begin their work at the appointed time April 1 It is not known how long the work will continue but it is hoped to complete it in two months EDWARD B ROSA FEDERAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE CON SERVATION OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH CERTAIN contributors to American Health the official organ of the American Health League published by the Committee of One Hundred have expressed the opinion that while the care and health of animals is a mat ter of extreme importance to the federal gov ernment the health of human beings on the other hand is a matter of indifference At least this is what one would infer from the following quotations taken from Americanr Health John Pease Norton PhD American Health March 1908 page 12 We look with horror on the black plague of the middle ages The black waste was but a passing cloud compared with the white waste visitation Of the people living today over eight millions will die of tuberculosis and the federal govern ment does not raise a hand to help them THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE PROTECTS ANIMALS The Department of Agriculture spends seven million dollars on plant health and animal health every year but with the exception of the splendid work done by Doctors Wiley Atwater and Bene dict Congress does not directly appropriate one cent for promoting the physical wellbeing of babies Thousands have been expended in stamp ing out cholera among swine but not one dollar was ever voted for eradicating pneumonia among human beings Mrs Gibson Arnoldi Bulletin of the Committee of One Hundred on National Health Sep tember 1909 page 8 The national government of the United States spends 7000000 on plant and animal health every year and hundreds of thousands fighting beetles and potato bugs but not one cent to aid the six million babies that will die under two years of age during the next census period while mothers sit by and watch in utter helplessness This number could probably be decreased by as much as one half Why is nothing done    Bulletin No 33 of the Committee of One Hundred on National Health October 1909 At a meeting held in Denver in August an inter esting paper on meat inspection was read by Miss Lakey chairman of the food committee of the National Consumers League Resolutions were adopted recommending that states and cities should provide more sanitary slaughter houses Miss Lakey showed that the federal inspection is inadequate To those who are more familiar with the health work now being carried on by the fed eral government here at Washington and in its branch laboratories these statements while correct as to certain details are objec tionable because of their implications The above quotation from Bulletin 33 for ex ample was so placed as to carry to the writer at least the impression that the federal in spection was being criticized not alone as to the quantity of meat inspected but also as to the quality of the inspection The writer has been corrected by one who attended the Den ver meeting of the Association of State and National Food and Dairy Departments and informed that the federal meat inspection service was held up by Miss Lakey as a good 611N S VOL XXXI No 799 example to be aggressively followed by state and municipal health boards Inefficiency was not implied The object of this article is not to criticize these contributors or the Committee of One Hundred but rather to point out that far from being a matter of indifference the na tional health is a matter of the gravest con cern For what purpose is the health work now being carried on in the following federal de partments  First The Bureau of Chemistry The work of this bureau involving an annual ex penditure of approximately 750000 partic ularly in the enforcement of the food and drugs act is too well known to need descrip tion here Even the babies have not been forgotten the composition and digestibility of baby foods have been studied a more de tailed and thorough study of the subject has been planned and will probably be in progress in the near future Considerable work is be ing done upon soothing syrups manufac tured and sold in violation of the food and drugs act Second The Hygienic Laboratory of the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service This laboratory has made investigations along several lines Certain parasitic diseases in man e g hookworm disease have been studied milk and its relation to the public health has been a subject of both extensive and intensive research Investigations of the dissemination of tuberculosis and typhoid fever through interstate traffic are in progress The Marine Hospital Service maintains the federal quarantine appropriation400000 for the fiscal year ending June 30 1909 For the same year congress appropriated 700000 to be used by the Public Health and Marine Hospital Service in case of threat ened or actual epidemic of cholera typhus fever    in aid of state and local boards  in preventing and suppressing the spread of same    Third The investigations on the food and nutrition of man now being carried on through the Office of Experiment Stations Likewise of undoubted value is the work of the Surgeon General of the United States Army The work done by that office in point ing out the relation between the mosquito and the spread of yellow fever is obviously of vital importance Fourth The Bureau of Animal Industry In this bureau the federal health work is be ing carried on through several of its divisions The Meat Inspection Division for which congress appropriates 3000000 per year in spects the interstate traffic in meat thus assuring the country a clean meat supply Hook worm in man was first suspected through the work that has been done with this parasite in animals To certain criticisms of the federal inspec tion a very interesting reply by the Bureau of Animal Industry is to be found in the Twentythird Annual Report of that bureau for 1906 page 443 et seq The Dairy Division is making every effort to cleanse and purify and improve the milk and dairy products of the country The proper construction care and ventilation of the barn as well as improved methods of ma king cheese are subjects of investigation For the inspection of butterrenovating fac tories 10000 are expended annually For investigations on methods of improving the quality and quantity of dairy products 30 000 are expended annually If the amount of money expended by the federal government through these several bureaus considerably over 4000000 per annum may be taken as a correct measure of the interest taken in their work it follows that the national health is a matter of some thing more than incidental interest to the federal authorities The abovementioned amounts however do not by any means repre sent the total amount expended through chan nels making for the national health If the eating of certain abnormal varieties of corn in certain localities induces seriously dis eased conditions in the people eating it is the expenditure in studying the biology of the corn any less useful than that in studying the disease in man 612 SCIENCEAPRIL 22 1910 SCIENCE The relations of some of the branches of federal activity to the public health are very direct and obvious Some of the investiga tions of the Hygienic Laboratory of the Pub lic Health and Marine Hospital Service for example resulting in the tracing of typhoid fever to contaminated milk are evidently made for the immediate protection of the public The work of the Meat Inspection Division in preventing the sale of the meat of diseased animals is just as immediate in its purpose It is evident that a plentiful supply of whole some food is as essential to the health of a people as any other measure for the preven tion or eradication of disease Wellnour ished bodies may resist disease where impov erished ones succumb But the bearings of other branches of fed eral activity upon the public health may not be so obvious to the superficial or casual ob server To such an observer the study of the proper construction and ventilation of a barn may not be as close to the public health as the study of the properties of an antitoxic serum But in these days of preventive med icine we are willing not alone to be cured of disease but even to prevent it in almost any way whatsoeverfor example by using only clean milk from clean healthy cows and which obviously can only be kept clean and healthy in barns of sanitary construction and ventilation The enemy the pathogenic microorganism in this case will enter through any gate All of them must be closed The figures quoted above have been taken from Document No 1031 House of Repre sentatives Treasury Department Document No 2516 Estimates of Appropriations for the fiscal year ending June 30 1910 also Treasury Department Document No 2533 Statements of Balances Appropriations and Disbursements of the Government for the fiscal year ended June 30 1908 Both of these publications are easily obtainable by those interested at the Library of the U S De partment of Agriculture W N BERG WASHINGTON D C A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH SENATOR OWEN has introduced in the senate a bill establishing a Department of Public Health which has been read twice and re ferred to the Committee on Public Health and National Quarantine The principle of this bill has been approved by the committee of one hundred of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and mem bers of the Association are urged to make efforts to secure the passage of the bill more especially by writing letters to members of congress endorsing the principle of the bill and in favor of a wide extension of the present health work of the national government President Taft in his public addresses as in his first annual message to congress both the great political parties in their platforms the National Grange the American Federa tion of Labor the American Medical Asso ciation the Committee of One Hundred and others have put themselves on record as in favor of a broad reform of the existing situa tion It is important to impress upon con gress that there is a thoughtful and wide spread demand in this country for compre hensive reform at this time THE AMERICAN CHEMICAL SOCIETY THE summer meeting of the American Chemical Society to be held in San Francisco July 1215 1910 promises to be one of the pleasantest outings ever enjoyed by the mem bers of the society A special train made up of the Santa Fes finest equipment will leave Chicago on the evening of July 4 arriving at Colorado Springs on the morning of July 6 About six hours will be allowed for a trip to Manitou the Garden of the Gods or to the top of Pikes Peak Leaving about one oclock the train will reach Adamana on July 7 and a half day will be spent in a visit to the Petrified Forests two of which and possibly three may be exam ined Leaving Adamana that night the party will arrive at the Grand Canyon of the Colo rado on the morning of July 8 where the day will be spent Leaving the Grand Canyon that evening the train will arrive at Redlands 613

j100128,Columbia Law Review,1109753,Effect of Modern Legislation on Tenancy by the Entirety,i246208,whether the debtor intended a preference or not so long as the creditor is innocent In either case it is equally within Sec 6oa Likewise there is no less inequality in the distribution In fact we fail to find any argument showing the innocent creditors higher equity when the debtor undesignedly prefers him Strictly speaking the payment might be much less than the creditor would receive were he to return the money prove his whole claim and take his pro rata share Not until this apportionment is made among the creditors can it be said that the payment gives him a greater percentage of his claim and if that cannot be asserted how is he within the meaning of Sec 6oa a preferred creditor  If he is not such why should he not be allowed at least an equal percentage of his debt for Sec 57g does not then apply to him As he must by the act prove or not prove the remainder of his claim the Courts realizing the inequality in allowing him to prove construe the words in Sec 6oa defining preference as a transfer of property the effect of which will enable any one creditor to obtain a greater percentage of his debt to mean that if the creditor insist on the transfer and then prove the remainder of his claim he would be getting a greater percentage and would become a preferred creditor within Sec 6oa Thus in order to prevent him from becoming a preferred creditor they really treat him as such and apply to him Sec 57g But the creditor to whom money has been paid by a debtor at the time insolvent may return this money and prove his whole claim He consequently has the privilege of judging for himself as to which method would yield him the larger proportion and this cer tainly more nearly approaches an equitable distribution than would result were the creditor to prove the remainder of his claim and also retain that which after such a proof of claim would un doubtedly constitute a preference under Secs 6oa and 57g EFFECT OF MODERN LEGISLATION ON TENANCY BY THE ENTIRETY Such tenancy arises at common law when a conveyance is made to husband and wife during coverture which if made to two strangers would create a joint tenancy Its peculiarities arose from the identity which the common law conceives to exist between husband and wife Littleton Sect 291 In such tenancy a husband cannot bar the wifes right by survivorship in any partDoe v Parret 5 T R 652 at 654 They are accordingly said to hold per tout el non per my Chailis Real Prop p 304 so that partition cannot be made of the estate I Prest Est 135 Lord Coke does not use the phrase by entireties He speaks of joint estates where the husband and wife shall have no moietiesa kind of inseverable joint tenancy The earliest American edition of Blackstone makes no mention of tenancy by the entirety though what is apparently a subsequent insertion Bk II p I82 is often referred to and Chancellor Kent in a note IV Kent Corn 363 says that Mr Ram in his Outline of Tenure and Tenancy pp I70174 differs NO TES 55COLUMiBIA LA W REVIEW from all the great property lawyers in saying this is a species of joint tenancy It would seem natural that a tenancy so nearly related to joint tenancy would have disappeared after the legislation directed against the latter It would surely seem that the Married Womens Acts would so far destroy the fictitious identity of husband and wife as to eliminate tenancy by the entirety Mander v Harrzs 24 Ch Div 222 Thornley v Thorniey I893 2 Ch 229 The American courts however have not generally so held I Wash R Prop Chap XIII The New York cases have been particularly interesting In Meeker v Wright 76 N Y 262 the Court was of opinion that the status of coverture had been so far changed as to destroy tenancy by the entirety On this dictum Feely v Buckley 28 Hun 45I and other cases were decided but were overruled by Bertles v Nunan 92 N Y 152 which held that when husband and wife were grantees of a freehold they took as tenants of the entirety Zorn tlein v Bram Ioo N Y io held that in such case the grantee from the wife had no claim whatever as against a subsequent grantee from the husband and wife jointly In Price v Pestka 54 App Div 59 decided Nov Io I900 the Court said that husband and wife took as tenants of the entirety notwithstanding 56 N Y Real Prop Law which declared that every estate granted or devised to two or more persons in their own right shall be a tenancy in common unless expressly declared to be in joint tenancy The tenancy

TRUSTSIn Taylor v Griswld 2 J S Gr 222 I833 the Court denied the right of a stockholder to vote by proxy unless power to do so had been expressly or impliedly conferred by the Legislature on the ground that each stockholder is expected to exercise his individual judgment In Cone v Russell 48 N J Eq 208 I89I this principle was applied to a proxy irrevocable for five years but great stress was laid on the fact that the object to be attained was against public policy referring to Woodruffv Wentworlh 133 Mass 309 I882 where an ordinary contract between two stockholders for a similar purpose

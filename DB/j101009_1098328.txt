than the judges on the bench This is about the history of this heresy and the length to which it was being stretched shows how grateful we should be to our appellate court for removing the tension There is nothing to be desired in Judge Rielys opinion unless it be that he should have omitted some words that indicate that the court will regard the finding of the commissioner as a stronger presumption than the well settled rule of common sense that in all doubtful cases the presumption must be against him who has to sustain the affirmative The real rule ought to be that no matter what the finding of the com missioner is the court will decide the question according to the weight of the evidence and if that be equally balanced the ordinary pre sumption according to the burden of proof will prevail There is no authority that I know of in law for attaching weight to the finding of any commissioner that is excepted to in time  for the courts and the juries are the only constituted triers of fact The remedy for the ob jection that all mlen are six feet high on paper consists not in delegating the functions of courts and juries to commissioners but in bringing the witness personally before the court in chancery as well as at law when ever the ends of justice demand it R T BARTON WVinchester Va BURDEN OF PROOF IN EJECTMENT So much of the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in Reusens v Lawson 21 S E Rep 347 as overrules Hop kins v Ward 6 Munf 38 has been discussed no little among the land lawyers of the two Virginias It is claimed by many of them that the rule laid down in Hopkins v Ward in 1817 in substance that those who shelter under an exception must show themselves within it was applied to inclusive surveys  and has been acted upon by the Courts of Virginia without exception ever since until the decision in Reusens v Lawson They assert that it was settled by the Court in Hopkins v Ward that in the trial of an ejectment case the plaintiff was entitled to recover all 1895 489VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the lands within his grant although issued upon an inclusive survey without locating the excepted lands that it was sufficient for the plaintiff claiming under that character of grant to locate his exterior bounds and prove that defendants claim laid within them that the defendant could not defeat the plaintiff without showing himself within the lands reserved in and excepted from the operation of the plain tiffs grant in other words that the burden of proof was on the de fendant to locate the reserved lands and show himself within them It is generally admitted that this doctrine is unsound in principle but it is asserted that the trial courts having been controlled by it so long it has become a rule of property and should not now be changed The matter is of no little importance to many of the people living in the southwestern part of the two States The forerunner to Reusens v Lawson was the case of Stockton v Mor riss 39 W Va 432 decided first in 1892 finally in 1894 in which the Supreme Court of West Virginia with trepidation declared for the first time the rule so boldly and unanimously maintained in Reusens v Lawson In Stockton v Morriss Judge Brannon says on page 444  It is warmly pressed in argument for the other view that none of the cases in support of the proposition that the plaintiff not the defendant must locate the land reserved hold that the burden of doing so rests upon the plaintiff Specifically and pointedly I confess they do not but I assert that deductively and logically they do In this latter case the plaintiffs claimed under a grant to John Steel for 18500 acres including 9065 acres of prior claims excepted from the operation of the grant while the defendants claimed 657 acres under a patent issued in 1856 At the trial the plaintiffs failed to locate all the excepted lands and the defendants failed to prove them selves within any specific reservation There was a verdict for the plaintiffs and the defendants appealed The case turned in the Appellate Court on the single question as to the burden of proof whether it was upon the plaintiffs or defendants to locate the excepted lands The plaintiffs in error contended that this onus was on the plaintiffs and to sustain this contention laid down the following propositions as sustained by the authorities 1 That the action of ejectment not being a comparison of titles the plaintiff must recover on the strength of his own title 490 Nov1895 BURDEN OF PROOF IN EJECTMENT 491 2 That he must show a perfect legal title in himself and the right of possession to the land claimed by the defendant 3 That an inclusive grant conveys no title whatever to the ex cepted lands 4 That in order to show that the land claimed by the defendant belongs to the plaintiff in such case the plaintiff must establish his exterior boundaries and locate the excepted lands and show that the land claimed by the defendant is within the exterior bounds of the plaintiffs grant and without the lands excepted therefrom Of course there was no dispute between counsel except as to the last proposition The case was argued in 1891 and in 1892 decided unanimously in favor of the plaintiffs in error The decision was not only a surprise to the counsel for the defend ants in error but was deemed such a revolution in the land law of the State that other attorneys joined in the petition for a rehearing a great outcry went up to the Court and a rehearing was granted In the petition for the rehearing it is alleged That the contrary doctrine has obtained in this State and in Virginia ever since the first case involving the construction of such grants and has been recognized and acted upon universally and without exception both by nisi prius courts and appellate courts and become a rule of property upon which now depends the title to millions of acres of land  That never since inclusive grants were authorized had the doctrine laid down in Hopkins v Ward been questioned in a single instance beyond the bare suggestion in Willard v Bryan 21 W Va 65 And that even the learned counsel the late S A Miller who tried the case below and prepared petition for an appeal considered the contrary doctrine too deeply buried to be worthy of a place among the errors assigned His successor the writer taking courage from the suggestion referred to and expressly excluded from the decision in Willard v Bryan is the first lawyer in Virginia or in West Virginia bold enough to present it as a legal question for the consideration of the Court  That the title to threefourths of the lands in the southern half of the State would be jeopardized and practically destroyed if the rule is now changed as proposed Judge Daniel B Lucas was then on the bench and declined to unite in the order granting a rehearing He was succeeded by Judge Dent Judge Holt having presided in the trial below could not sit in theVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER case in the Appellate Court While on the Circuit Court he held to the doctrine of Hopkins v Ward Before the final decision was rendered the Supreme Court of the United States had decided Maxwell Land Grant Co v Dawson 151 U S 589 by which the new  doctrine was unanimously approved the Court citing about the same authorities relied on by the Supreme Court of West Virginia for their decision rendered in 1892 The decision in the case of the Maxwell Land rant Co v Dawson no doubt went a long way with Judges Brannon and Dent in confirm ing their faith in this doctrine and now that the present able Court of Appeals of Virginia has followed the way blazed by them it must be to them as it is to the writer peculiarly gratifying It may be a very inconvenient rule to plaintiffs in ejectment cases in Virginia and West Virginia claiming under inclusive grants but the logic and principle of the rule seem to me to be unanswerable It is not at all probable that any great evils will flow from it Whatever the plaintiffs lose the defendants will gain and the defendants are usually the citizens of the State who have borne the toil of opening the forest and cultivating the field and instead of unsettling the titles to mil lions of acres in the two Virginias it will in my humble opinion have the opposite effect The principal litigation in land titles in the two States has grown out of these old discredited inclusive grants on many of which no taxes have been paid until recent railroadbuilding has made the land valu able and now that this burden is plainly put upon parties now trying to maintain them they will stop and consider well the chances of recovery before they drag the occupants into distant Federal Courts I regard the rule of practice as a blessing to many of the citizens of the two Statesa public good for which we should be thankful Now that the highest courts of the two States and of the United States have done their part wisely and well it is to be hoped the good work will be supplemented by the legislatures of the two States As the statute law of both States now exists several and distinct persons claiming several and distinct parcels of land by separate and distinct titles may be and usually are joined as defendants in one action of ejectment if their holdings are within the same survey This anomalous condition of the law can hardly be found in any other of the States of the Union but whether it can or not such a state of the law ought not to be allowed to remain Under the laws of the United States the practice of the Federal 492 NovBURDEN OF PROOF IN EJECTMENT Law Courts is controlled by the State laws and under the present system the holders of these large surveys who are usually non residents bring their actions in the Federal Courts against everybody within the survey If suit had to be brought against adverse claim ants separately to recover only what each one claimed it would not often happen that the amount in controversy would be sufficient to give the Federal Courts jurisdiction To the poor man who has a small holding it is about as wise for him to let the judgment of ouster go by default as to undertake to defend the suit far away from his home The landsharks who speculate in wildcat titles know this and consider it in their purchases Any person who has had any knowledge of the hardships inflicted upon the people by these land suits in Federal Courts and who believes that legislation should have for its object the welfare of the people of the State instead of other people must neces sarily favor such legislation as will remove this great inconvenience Governor Wilson of West Virginia in a message to the Legislature called in special session in January 1890 pointed out the evils of our system and suggested the changes in our statutes necessary to cure them but the Legislature which was not in accord with the Executive Depart ment of the State at that time took no action J M

length of time over which it extends is immaterial and it is sufficient if the defendant was able to exercise his judgment and to form a definite purpose State v Brown I889 41 Minn 319 State v Murray 1894 25 Ore 241 The California court does not notice this position but places its affirmance squarely upon the ground that the defendants original crim inal intent in arming himself for the proposed felony carried over after the abandonment of that plan and colored his subsequent independent act As a principle of law this attitude is difficult to support and it would be interesting to know to what extent the learned Court would carry it It would seem to be an extreme construction to hold that because the defendant had determined to kill anyone who might in terfere with him in committing burglary that he therefore intended to kill anyone who might try to arrest him for some other offense e g carrying concealed weapons after he had wholly abandoned his felonious plan THE NEW YORK ELEVATED RAILWAY CASESThe recent case of Muhlker v N   Harlem R R I905 197 U S 544 marks an interesting phase in the history of the Elevated Railway Cases but unfortunately leaves the ultimate fate of those decisions more con jectural than ever When this case was before the State court it was held that the doctrine of the Story case to the effect that a man had a property right to easements in the street for the infringement of which he could recover did not apply where the railroad had been ordered by the legislature to elevate its structure See 2 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW I58 3 Id 347 An appeal was taken to the United States Supreme Court upon the ground that the Act of 1892 compelling the defendant to ele vate its tracks did not provide compensation for the damage to the plaintiffs easements over the street and therefore violated the obliga tion of a contract in two regards first it violated the obligation of the contract made by New York City when it purchased the fee of Park Avenue from the plaintiffs predecessor and covenanted to keep the same open as a street and second it violated the obligation of the contract by which the plaintiff acquired the property since it disre garded the doctrine of the Story case which being law at the time the plaintiff acquired his property became part of his contract of purchase The Supreme Court while expressing its approval of the first ground assigned expressly based its decision upon the second but without citing any authorities The principle is not entirely novel Bronson v Kinzie 1843 i How 31 1 MlcCraken v Hayward 1844 2 How 608 These cases lay down the doctrine that the  obligation  of a con tract includes all the laws in force when the contract is made and applicable thereto Any modification of these laws is therefore uncon stitutional in so far as it affects contracts made under them Re ferring to the merits of the question involved in the Story case the U S Court expressed itself as being entirely satisfied with the prin ciples therein laid down Despite this endorsement the Court of Appeals shortly thereafter held Bennet v L I Ry Co NY 9o5 74 N E 418 that an abutting owner suffered no legal injury from an elevated structure of a surface 542line where the same was built to connect its tracks with an elevated railroad The Lewziand Muhlker cases were held inapplicable on the ground that here the defendant had obtained title to its right of way before the street was laid out and subsequent purchasers of abutting lands took subject to its vested rights The obvious conclusion would seem to be that the principles of the Story case are not regarded by the Court with favor and their application will be closely restricted They were so distinguished and excluded in the Fries case I901 169 N Y 270 and again in Lauer v N Y I904 i8oN Y 87 The doctrine of the Siory case was still further narrowed by declaring the erection by the city of a fiftyfoot viaduct over the street for the pur pose of facilitating traffic to be analogous to the case of changing the grade on a street which in New York gives rise to no cause of action Radclijs Executors v The Mayor 1850 4 N Y I95 See 5 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 250 NATURE OF RIGHTS IN A DEAD BoDYThe question of the right in a dead body has recently been considered by the Supreme Court of Georgia A widow was allowed substantial damages for the mutilation of the dead body of her husband caused by the negligence of the de fendant carrier on the theory of an infringement of a quasiproperty right L  N Ry Co v Wilson 1905 51 S E 24 The discus sion of the nature of this right is of comparatively recent origin In England such questions were formerly under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Ecclesiastical Courts This accounts for the lack of ancient authority Early dicta deny any property right in a corpse at com mon law Hayness Case 1613 12 Coke 113 and this is now the law in England Regina v Sharpe 1857 Dea  Bell C C i60 Williams v Williams 1882 20 Ch Div 659 The American courts also have refused to recognize a purely proprietary right Grfith v C C  A Ry Co I884 28 S C 25 Thus a itan may not dis pose of his own body by will Enos v Snyder 90oo 131 Cal 68 nor bring replevin for anothers body Keyes v Konkel i899 I 9 Mich 550 Yet our courts with a single exception have everywhere recognized the existence of some right in the wife or nearest relative to an undisturbed possession of the body until burial Various theories for this right have been advanced The indefinite and un satisfactory term of a quasiproperty right is suggested Pierce v Cemetery 1872 10 R I 227 Another court disregarding the na ture of the right has given damages as for mental suffering al ne Hale v Bonner 1891 82 Tex 33 A more satisfactory theory  found in a decision of the New York court since burial is a duty re quired by the law it will be protected by the law Foley v Phelps 1896 i App Div 55I The idea of any property right is rejected This recognition of a purely personal right is not anomalous It would belong to that class of rights such as a married womans right to her husbands consortium or the right to ones fair name and repu tation the infringement of which is an injury neither to property nor to the physical person The principal injury consists in outraged feelings and to the Texas court this alone is sufficient ground for awarding damages But ac NOTES 543

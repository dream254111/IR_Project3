J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,102201,A FULL DESCRIPTION WITH THE USE OF THE NEW CONTRIUANCE FOR RAISINGWATER PROPOUNDED IN THE PHIL TRANS N DEGREES 173 BY DR PAPIN FELLOW OF THE R S,I206880,PHILOSOPH TRANSACT NUMB178 E B N1274 A FULL DESCRIPTION WITH THE USE OF THE NEW CONTRI VANCE FOR RAISINGWATER PROPOUNDED IN THE PHIL TRANS NO 173 BY DR PAPIN FELLOW OF THE R S THERE BEING ALREADY SIX MONTHS SINCE I DID FIRST PROPOUND A NEW WAY FOR RAISING WATERPRINTED SINCE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF JULY 1685 AND NO BODY HAVING YET UNRIDDLED IT I BELIEVE IT WOULD BE NEEDLESS TO CONCEAL IT ANY LONGER BUT WILL RATHER AC CORDING TO MY PROMISE GIVE A FULL DESCRIPTION OF THE WHOLE CONTRIVANCE THAT THE R S MAY BE PLEASED TO IMPROVE IT AND THAT IT MAY BE MADE USE OF BY THOSE WHO MAY HAVE OCCASION FOR IT TAB 1 FIG 4 A A IS THE GREAT TUMBLER THAT MUST HAVE SOME LITTLE HOLE IN THE BOTTOM AS I I L L A SLENDER PIPE HIDDEN BY THE CHIMNEYBOARD B B WHEREBY THE TUMBLER A A HATH COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUMP OR BELLOWS M M M M SOME KIND OF PUMP OR BELLOWS WELL SHUT AND HAVING NO OTHER APERTURE BUT THROUGH THE PIPE I L L THESE ARE PUT IN SOME SECRET PLACE WHERE A BODY MAY PLAY THE SAME AND NOT BE SEEN N N A SLENDER PIPE THAT MAKES A COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE GLASS A A AND THE CROWN F F THIS PIPE REACHETH NEAR TO THE COVER OF THE CROWN THAT THE WA TER CONTAIND IN IT MAY NOT RUN DOWN BY THAT APER TURE E E THE FACTITIOUS CORALL HOLLOW WITHIN SHUT AT THE BOTTOM AND OPEN AT THE TOP D D D D TWO CROOKED PIPES SODDERED TO THE SIDES OF THE CORALL E E SO THAT THE WATER RUNNING DOWN THE CORALL MAY SPOUT OUT THROUGH THE HOLES D D O O A PIPE HIDDEN IN THE CORALL E E PASSING THROUGH THE1275 THE BOTTOM OF THE SAME WHERE IT MUST BE WELL SOD DERED AND REACHING NEAR TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ROCK C C P P A PIPE TO CONVEY THE WATER FROM THE GLASS G G INTO THE ROCK C C THIS PIPE IS WELL SODDERED TO THE COVER OF THE SAYD ROCK Q A VALVE WORKING BY A SPRING AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PIPE P P TO KEEP THE WATER THAT GETS IN THAT WAY FROM RETURNING BACK R ANOTHER VALVE AT THE TOP OF THE PIPE O O THAT THE WATER GETTING UP THAT WAY MAY NOT FALL THROUGH THE SAME NOW IT IS PLAIN THAT THE ROCK C C BEING FILLD PART LY WITH WATER AND PARTLY WITH AIR IF WE OPEN THE BEL LOWS M M THE AIR FROM THE CROWN F F MUST RUN THROUGH THE PIPE N N INTO THE TUMBLER A A AND THENCE THROUGH THE PIPE I L L INTO M M TO FILL THE VACUITY MADE THEREIN THE AIR IN THE CROWN F F BE ING THUS RARIFIED GIVES LIBERTY TO THE AIR IN THE ROCK C C TO RARIFY TOO BY DRIVING THE WATER THROUGH THE PIPE O O THE WATER BEING GOT UP INTO THE CROWN F F RUNS DOWN THE CORALL E E AND THROUGH THE CROOKED PIPES D D D SPOUTS OUT AT THEIR UPPER APERTURES AND FROM THE SHELLS H H FALLS UPON THE ROCK C C IF WE COME AFTERWARDS TO SHUTT THE BELLOWS M M THE AIR GOT INTO THEIR VACUITY MUST RUN BACK INTO THE TUMBLERS A A AND PRESS UPON THE WATER AT THE TOP OF THE ROCK C C BUT THE AIR IN THE SAYD ROCK HAVING BEEN RARIFIED ITS SPRING IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO RESIST THIS PRESSURE AND SO THE WATER IS FORCED INTO THE SAYD ROCK THROUGH THE PIPE P P AND BY THUS OPENING AND SHUTTING THE BELLOWS M M THE WATER MUST CONSTANTLY CIRCULATE BY THE WAYS AFORESAYD AS FOR THE USES THIS WAY FOR RAISING WATER MAY BE APPLYD TO THIS I DO CONCEIVE THE GLASSES BEING MEER LY TO CONCEAL THE SECRET MUST BE LEFT OUT AND THERE X X X 3 MAY1276 MAY BE MADE SEVERALL RECEPTACLES ABOVE ONE ANOTHER TO RECEIVE THE RAISD WATER SO AS DOTH THE CROWN F F AND THERE SHOULD BE AS MANY BELLOWS TO COMMUNICATE EVERY ONE WITH ONE RECEPTACLE THESE BELLOWS SHOULD BE MOVED BY AN AXIS SO THAT WHEN THE FIRST IS OPEN THE SECOND SHOULD BE SHUT THE THIRD OPEN THE FOURTH SHUT AND SO FORTH ALTERNATIVELY WHICH MAY BE EASI LY DONE BY THIS MEANS THE FIRST OR LOWEST RECEPTACLE WOULD GIVE THE NECESSARY SUPPLY OF WATER TO THE SECOND THE SECOND TO THE THIRD THE THIRD TO THE FOURTH C TILL THE WATER WOULD BE RAISD TO THE INTENDED HEIGHT SUCH RECEPTACLES MIGHT EASILY BE SET TWELVE OR FIFTEEN FOOT ABOVE ONE ANOTHER AND SO BUT FEW OF THEM MIGHT RAISE WATER TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHTH AS WELL AS ORDINARY PUMPS DO BUT THIS NEW WAY WOULD HAVE THIS ADVANTAGE THAT IN THE ORDINARY PUMPS THE STRENGTH TO BE APPLYED LYETH NEAR THE WATER TO BE RAISED BUT BY THIS CONTRIVANCE THE STREAM OF A RIVER MAY BE AP PLYED TO DRAW WATER OUT OF A MINE FAR DISTANT FROM IT BY THE SAME WAY THE STREAM OF THE THAMES MIGHT KEEP CONSTANT WATER WORKS IN WINDSORCASTLE AS EASIE ALMOST AS IN THE LOWEST FIELDS THE RIVER SEINE MIGHT DO THE SAME AT ST GERMAIN AND PERHAPS AT VERSAILLES TOO NOTWITHSTANDING THE GREAT DISTANCE FOR IT IS TO BE OB SERVED THAT THE PIPES OF COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE BELLOWS AND ENGINE BEING MEERLY FOR THE CONVEY ING OF THE AIR WHICH MOVES VERY SWIFTLY THEY MAY BE SLENDER ENOUGH AND SO CONTAIN BUT A SMALL QUANTITY OF AIR TO BE RARIFIED AND BESIDES THEY WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO BURST OR LEAK SINCE THE PRESSURE THEY BEARBEING ALL EXTER NALL TO THE PIPE WILL RATHER STRENGTHEN THEN BREAK THE SAME FROM WHENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SAYD PIPES NEED NOT BE STRONG BUT MAY BE MADE AT VERY SMALL CHARGES IT IS ALSO TO BE OBSERVED THAT THOSE BELLOWS THAT ARE OPEN HAVE THE AIR IN THEM VERY MUCH RARI FIED SO THAT THE OUTWARD AIR LYETH HEAVY UPON TO SHUT THEM1277 THEM BY WHICH MEANS THE MOTION OF THE ENGINE MUST BE HELPT IN LIFTING UP THE OPPOSITE BELLOWS THAT ARE TO BE OPENED AND THIS OBSERVATION MAY ANSWER THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY THAT MIGHT BE OBJECTED AGAINST THIS CONTRI VANCE SO THAT I DONT QUESTION BUT THIS WAY FOR RAIS ING WATER MAY ON SEVERALL OCCASIONS BE OF A GREAT AD VANTAGE AS A FARTHER EXPLICATION OF THE USE OF THIS CONTRIVANCE SEE TAB 3 FIG 2 A B ABARE SEVERAL RECEPTACLES SET ABOVE ONE ANOTHER WHICH MUST BE WELL SHUTT AND SODDERED EVERY WHERE C D D C D D ARE TWO SLENDER PIPES WHEREBY THE FIRST AND THIRD RECEPTACLES HAVE A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUMP H H E F F E F F TWO OTHER SLENDER PIPES WHEREBY THE SECOND AND FOURTH RECEPTACLES HAVE A COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUMP I I H H I I TWO PUMPS WHOSE PLUGS ARE SO MOVED BY THE AXIS L L THAT WHEN ONE GOETH DOWN THE OTHER GO ETH UP M M A WHEEL FASTENED TO THE AXIS L L THAT IT MAY BE MOVED BY THE STREAM OF A RIVER N O P Q N O P Q ARE BIG PIPES FOR THE WATER TO TO GO UP FROM A LOWER INTO A HIGHER RECEPTACLE O Q O Q ARE VALVES FITTED TO THE TOP OF THE FORE SAID PIPES THAT THE WATER MAY NOT GO DOWN THROUGH THE SAME NOW IT IS PLAIN THAT WHEN THE PLUG IN THE PUMP H H IS GOING UP THE AIR COMES IN THROUGH THE PIPES C D D AND SO IT IS RARIFIED IN THE FIRST AND THIRD RECEP TACLES MARKED A A AND BY THAT MEANS THE WATER MAY BE DRIVEN UP INTO THE SAID RECEPTACLES THROUGH THE PIPES N O BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME THE PLUG IN THE PUMP I I GOING DOWN CAUSETH THE AIR TO RETURN TO ITS ORDI NARY PRESSURE IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH RECEPTACLES THAT IT MAY BE ABLE TO DRIVE UP THE WATER THROUGH THE1278 THE SAID PIPES N O AND THE LOWEST PIPE DRAWS THE WA TER THAT LYES OPEN TO THE AIR BY THE SAME REASON WHEN THE PLUG IN THE PUMP I I GOETH UP THE AIR MUST COME IN THROUGH THE PIPES E F F AND SO IT IS RARIFIED IN THE SECOND AND FOURTH RECEPTACLES MARKED B B AND BY THAT MEANS THE WATER MAY BE DRIVEN UP INTO THE SAID RE CEPTACLES THROUGH THE PIPES P Q P Q BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME THE PLUG IN THE PUMP H H GOING DOWN CAUSES THE AIR TO RETURN TO ITS ORDINARY PRESSURE IN THE FIRST AND THIRD RECEPTACLES SO THAT IT IS ABLE

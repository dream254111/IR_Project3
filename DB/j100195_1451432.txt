Rabbi David Tevele Schiff R ZEVI HIRSCHEL LEWIN left London for Halberstadt in the spring of 1764 and the London community was not long in finding a successor for in 1765 we see R Tevele Schiff already installed as Rabbi of the Great Synagogue in Dukes Place Chiefly instrumental in bringing off his election was Aaron Goldsmith Goldschmidt the founder of the wellknown AngloJewish family to whom his uncle a certain R Johanan had recommended the Rabbi He is styled by Rabbi Tevele as cousin in a letter which he wrote to his brother R Meir on Adar 21 1776 App V Letter I A certain Rabbi Meir Hanover was likewise one of those who helped his cause by writing to friends in London60 We only know of one competitor who tried hard to succeed R Hirschel and that was his cousin R Meshullam Zalman son of Rabbi Jacob Emden of Altona who ultimately was chosen as Rabbi of the Hambro Synagogue and came to London likewise in the year I765 R Jacob Emden in his Auto biography gives us some interesting details with reference to this election6 He says In the month of Nisan of the same year I765 my son Rabbi Meshullam Zalman 60 See letter I in Appendix V 61 DD nFIn ed Kahana Warsaw I896 p 209 ff 445THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW was elected as Rabbi pn n MNx of the Hamburger con gregation in London likewise a result of my activity and endeavours for some time past and after I nearly gave up every hope for it For he had many opponents on the part of the Synagogue in Dukes Place which separated from the community and elected another Rabbi R Tevele Schiff firom FrankfortontheMain It was how ever from God and so all the plotting and obstacles the opposition placed in my sons way could not frustrate his election Even after he had duly been elected they con spired against him and people wrote me letters threatening that if he came to London they would attack and abuse him All this was done at the instigation of that man Laze Vr a pupil of that man who made special efforts and wrote me letters full of perversions and untruths with the intention of frightening me so that I should prevent my son from accepting the position The con gregation of the Hamburg Shool Synagogue however was anxious to have him and they had warned me beforehand to take no notice of that shameful letter He visited us here and remained during the past Shabuot festival and all the most notable men of the three Kehillahs Hamburg Altona and Wandsbeck gave evidence of the respect they felt for him He left us and entered upon his duties in London at the middle of Tammuz and was welcomed with great honours and with joy I have since heard that even his former enemies have now become his friends May God grant that he rise higher and higher and be blessed with children 62 It appears from this note that the London community had originally intended to appoint one Rabbi only for both 62 Apparently Meshullam Zalman had no children 446THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 447 Synagogues in the same way as Rabbi Zevi Hirschel had filled both offices simultaneously Jacob Emden had en deavoured to secure this position for his son but the more important part of the community was opposed to him and they elected R Tevele Schiff for Dukes Place Emdens party afterwards succeeded in appointing him as Rabbi of the HambroShool The man Laze or Lazar mentioned in Emdens note was an adherent of the BaalShem Samuel Falk a cabbalist and mystic who lived in London for about forty years until his death in the year I782 and Emden may refer to Falk when he says that Laze was a pupil of that man 63 We cannot tell whether Falk had a great following in the community but at the end of his days we know that he was well disposed towards R Tevele as he bequeathed him an annuity of Ic64 Also another member of the Beth Din R Abraham of Nancy is benefited by the same Will to the extent of fifty guineas65 The man Laze is often mentioned in MS Adler No 2241 which comprises the most interesting diary of Falks factotum Zevi Hirsch son of R Isaac Isik the Levite Shtadlan of Kalisch written in the years I74751 This Zevi b Isaac styles the man Laze Levi of Hamburg or YTI nrmn the windy Lazar and it appears that this Laze was sent by Falk on secret missions to Germany and Holland but was nevertheless very often in dire poverty 65 The reference may however also mean Eybeschiitz whom Emden often calls Wt

QUARTERLY REVIEW although he had a welltodo relative in London called Selig of Hamburg Whole pages of the MS are devoted to the debts which Laze made by borrowing fiom Falks servant various smaller sums It is not unlikely that Laze opposed the election of the son of R Jacob Emden who was known to be a bitter opponent of every cabbalist and mystic Lazar Hamburgers daughter Sarah married Benjamin Wolf Franklin of Breslau the ancestor of the Franklin family in London on August 28 1765 Mr Arthur Franklin in his  Records of the Franklin family London I915 p II reproduces the tombstone inscription of Lazar Hamburgers father According to Mr Franklin zbid p Io this Eleazar Leiza was known as Lazarus Joseph Although the Halizahletter to which he refers does not call him Leiza but IVP lrtWg ie Lezer there seems little doubt that he was identical with the Laze mentioned in Emdens autobiography who was the follower of the cabbalist Falk The letter of Halizah to which Mr Franklin refers and which he has shown me is dated Breslau 28th of Kislev 5526 I765 and is an undertaking by Asher Antshel and David Franklin brothers of Benjamin Wolf Franklin to give Halizah to the latters wife should he die without leaving issue Neither of these brothers however signed the document the signatories of which are Samuel ben Eliezer scribe of the Breslau community and Asher Lemel ben Isaac the beadle of that congregation They address the document to The great Rabbi who was formerly in Podhaice and is now Rabbi in London namely Rabbi Meshullam Zalman Emden As time went on the opponents of Emdens son seemed to have increased in number contrary to what Emden writes in his diary and Meshullam Zalman was ultimately compelled to leave 448THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 449 London We learn this from a letter of R Tevele to his brother dated Ist Ijjar I78066 in which he writes that R Meshullam had implored his congregation to let him remain in London but they insisted upon his leaving the country and agreed to give him an annuity of 5o and so he is leaving during this week He appears to have gone to StaryConstantinow in Russia67 Rabbi Tevele on the other hand was apparently well

gratitude In a letter to his brother written in the year 1776 when his father was apparently already old and feeble and unable to read he expresses his doubt whether his brother should communicate the contents of the letter to the father lest he should be disappointed in case the election of his brother Meir to the Rabbinate of Copenhagen referred to in the letter would not be realized Writing about the anniversary of his mothers death called Jahrzeit in I787 he says He could not answer his brothers letter of Sivan Ist earlier than the 26th date of the letter as their mothers Jahrzeit inter

while Buzaglo gave him the title in nn  the High Priest R Teveles name soon became well known in the Jewish world The London Jews had business connexions on the Continent and overseas and frequently questions and inquiries reached him from relations of London Jews in those parts especially religious questions relating to marriages and divorce cases He in turn had occasion to address letters of a similar kind to Rabbis residing on the Continent Thus we have a letter he wrote to R Joseph Steinhart of Furth inquiring whether the letter of divorce produced by the woman Frumet daughter of Leb wife of Lebele Roedelsheim dated five years pre viously was a valid document and he asks him for con firmation of the same This letter App V Letter XIII also contains a request to the same Rabbi to intervene in the case of a certain Gedaliah b Leb of Maineck near Burgkundstadt in Bavaria now living in London His wife refuses to follow him to this country and R Tevele asks the Rabbi of Furth to persuade her to accept a letter of divorce which the man intends sending to her through a messenger ne5 Interesting is the story of another woman the wife of Nathan Harris of London recorded in a

of this kind are very rarely accessible to the public although as a rule they are just the most important and most true sources of history R Tevele shows himself in especially favourable light in a letter referring to the sentence of death of a young Jew who had gone wrong by getting into bad company The boys associates were waylayers who having been caught redhanded were condemned to death in accordance with the law of those days R Tevele having persuaded himself that the Jewish youth had not committed any capital sin for which he would have deserved the death penalty moved heaven and earth to obtain pardon for him and although the letter in which this affair is described does not report the final result of the Rabbis endeavours it permits the conclusion that the Jew was pardoned on condition that he should leave the country and return to relatives in Germany who would take proper care of him for such was the undertaking the petitioners gave The letter is addressed to his

negotiating it I would not have done it even if it would only have meant writing so many and long letters as I had to do in this matter 89 Another letter written in the public interest is the one addressed to R Herz of Edelsheim whom R Tevele gives the honouring title of n1n mIw and refers to the legacy of the BaalShem Samuel Falk which formed the basis of a lawsuit dealt with at length in YHSE Transactions vol VIII Misc by Mr H S Q Henriques Cosman Lehman an admirer of Falk claims that the whole of the estate belongs to him and as most of the money was invested in French government

SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 465 will He was sure Herz would not refuse to do all he could especially as many scholars and poor people were waiting for the money If more convenient R Isaac Speyer could act as intermediary between them The Jews of London had not altered much since the days of his predecessor R Hirschel and the Rabbis duties likewise had remained the same consisting chiefly in giving decisions in Rabbinic law The study of Torah had not been advanced for R Tevele complains in nearly the same words as R Hirschel of having no pupils to teach and no friends with whom he could study Torah  I have no pupil and not even any one to whom I could speak on Talmudic subjects 01 and in another letter he says the Shulhan Aruch Orah Hayyim is forgotten here and nearly also the Yoreh Deah91 Communal organization progressed in so far as a proper BethDin seems to have been established one of the Dayyanim being Eleazar Lieberman who lived in London already in R Hirschels time His full name was Eliezer Lieberman Speyer of Halberstadt for thus he signs in the document II of Tishri 28 1772 It is the same R Eliezer who wrote to R Hirschel after his departure from London92 Other Dayyanim were Simon b Meshullam of Prague Abraham Hamburger of Nancy called Abraham Nancy and Jacob b Rabbi Eliezer It is however quite possible that they were not paid Dayyanim but private scholars only whom the Rabbi invited to join him when he wanted to form a BethDin for the purpose of arranging a Get or Halizah ceremony 90a Cp wliat R Hirschel says above part I p 22 and Letter IV of App V 91 Letter V of App V 92 Zevi Laz p 71  cp above p 3ITHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The Rabbis salary was 22oo yearly which very nearly was reduced during the American War In a letter written to his brother on ist Ijjar 1780 Letter III he complains that since the Rabbi of the Hambro Synagogue Meshullam Zalman Emden had left he had to do all the work without getting any remuneration for it Although in all proba bility the Dukes Place people will claim some contribution from the Hambro Synagogue for his services and as they had no intention of electing another Rabbi may succeed in getting 50 yearly from them that would not benefit him Neither had he had any income from weddings at that Syna gogue as the Parnassim gave their members the choice to let either one of their own Hazamin officiate on such occasions or to ask R Tevele to perform the ceremony It was on account of this permission that he had only one wedding at the Hambro Synagogue during a whole year and that was when the daughter of an intimate friend of his R Leb Tosca married His brother R Meir had asked him for pecuniary assistance and R Tevele answers that his income was scarcely sufficient for his own needs especially in war time and had he not in better times invested a little money in Government bonds which brought him a little extra income he could not make both ends meet In spite of that he says there are at every Synagogue meeting proposals to reduce his salary And then you imagine London is a Kehillah he writes far from it I cannot explain it all in a letter it could only be understood if told personally Similar remarks are found in Letter IV written two years later on 2z Adar 1782 at the time of the peace negotiations with America The proposals for a reduction of the Rabbis and other officials salaries continued to be put forward but do not think he says 466THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 467 that this is done on account of my not being in the favour of my congregants far from it I have very many intimate friends here It is simply the way of the land which nobody can fully understand who has not lived here just as little as they can realize in other countries the full meaning of the war with America and even what the papers now print with regards to peace prospects The powers of Parliament the rights of the king and other political affairs are different in England from every other land and in the same way is the Kehillah different from others as well as the proportion of his income and expendi ture which no one else can judge but he himself and he regrets having to refuse his brothers request Two documents in MS 4095 throw a light on the private life of London Jewry at the end of the eighteenth century Mr Zangwill in his Children of the Ghetto when he describes the story of a girl who in jest had a ring put on her finger and found herself married without her wish or even knowledge seems to have taken the story from real life93 According to Jewish law94 if a man gives to a woman anything that is worth a perutah small coin in presence of two Jewish witnesses and says I herewith wed thee as my wife according to the Law of Moses and Israel that is sufficient to make it a valid marriage This was used sometimes by wicked people as a means of extorting money from a rich man by marrying his daughter in this way and then to make payment of a large sum the condition of giving her a Get divorce In Zangwills novel the story is different as the whole thing was meant 93 See Zangwill Children of the Ghetto London Heineman I893 p 51 and the same authors King of Schnorrers p I 94 Talm B Kid 5 b Shulh Ar Eb Haezer c 27 ITHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW as a joke only on the part of the young man and it is interesting to find that in the time of Tevele Schiffs94 such things really happened for two such cases are recorded in the documents which we print as Nos 19 and 2o of Appendix V In one instance Judah b Joseph testifies that he performed the marriage ceremony on the girl Serche daughter of Moses with her consent although she now denies that the ceremony ever took place The other case was that of Simon b Hayyim Levi and the girls name was Mindel d of Samuel The fact that the bridegroom himself came forward as the chief witness in both cases and that the girl denied having given her consent seems to indicate that we have to deal with intentions of black mail against which could be argued that the parties appear to have belonged to the same class and that in case I the young people had been on intimate terms with one another but it would be unwise to draw any conclusion as to the state of morality among the London Jews from these incidents which may have been to the Rabbi some of the most exciting ones in his quiet and smooth career Official functions when he would have been expected to give an English address very seldom occurred and Rabbi Schiff knew probably very little English although his Yiddish was often intermixed with English phrases95 When the need arose he had the assistance of English teachers to help him out of difficulties Although it is stated that at the consecration of the Great Synagogue 94a 4 When Tevele

imaginary honours would fall away Only he who is quite sure of himself to be free from such vanity may do it in his lifetime Letter XII 26 Sivan I787 If Prof D Kaufman emphasizes the importance of

generally as in many instances they give references which are not to be found in any other written document and would therefore otherwise remain unknown In some cases they furnish confirmation of doubtful reports or supplement missing links to the chain of events The reader will find this in the letters written by and addressed to R Tevele which we print in the Appendix Though of later origin than the collection of private letters edited by Drs Alfred Landau and Bernhard Wachstein under the title fiidische Privatbriefe aus dem yahre 1619 Wien Braumiiller I9I1 the same qualities may be attributed to the letters printed in Appendix V as the editors apply to their publication They say in the Preface  Rightly has general attention been given in our times to these human docu ments out of which we can construe not only a picture of external circumstances but also a reflexion of the feelings 472THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 473 and sentiments of the people of past ages Einleitung p xv As far as AngloJewish historical records go I believe this is the first publication of Yiddish and Hebrew private letters There are nineteen letters in all and from the point of view of AngloJewish history those written by R Tevele himself and his son Moses to R Meir Schiff are the most important We hear the story of the Hazan Isaac Polak who had gone bankrupt and was put into prison The community resigned itself to its fate to have to do without its reader but when Atone ment day was approaching many speak well of him and wish to get him returned to office writes R Teveles son Moses Schiff on 14 Elul 1781 postscript to Letter VI They say that whatever wrong he has done was not of his own free will but he did it being misled by that man Hayyim  As is usual in Jewish communities they follow the way of their forefathers what the one loves the other hates and some are quite indifferent do not care one way or the other are neither friend nor foe R Isaac is still imprisoned and being a bankrupt cannot regain his liberty unless the majority of his creditors agree to his liberationsuch is the law of the countryand it will be difficult to get them all under one hat to agree to it It is a dishonour to the community such outcasts as exist here are not to be found in any other town It seemed all in vain the judge had passed sentence and the matter appeared settled but God helps those in trouble and the community advised R Isaac to present a memorial to the judge stating that the congregation had reserved him his post and that he was really punished on account of some one elses fault So far no answer has been received This R Isaac Polak was reader of the Great Synagogue VOL X IiTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW an engraving of him is in the possession of Mr Israel Solomons in London In I776 Parliament brought in a new law regarding passports which made travelling more difficult R Tevele advises a certain Siisskind b Jacob Schloss of Frankfort who had the intention of coming to London to bring a proper passport and health certificate with him or should even postpone his journey in case he had not left on arrival of the letter Letter I We hear also something of the business connexions of London Jews They dealt with Jews in Frankfort Holland and Italy But R Tevele knows nobody who had correspondents in Copenhagen which he says is like a suburb of Hamburg Brisk business was done in East Indian wares R Meir made some suggestions to his brother that his son Moses who a year or two afterwards became his brotherinlaw by marrying R Meirs wifes sister Mindel Zinzheim should try to do some business as commission agent R Tevele answers him on I Ijjar I780 that only East Indian goods are worth while dealing in but to deal in woollen merchandise is not profitable because most of the German merchants order these goods from England direct from the manufacturer To be an agent for export to Germany would necessitate having great credit here securities as the goods are sold on sixmonthly bills Besides there would hardly be any profit attached to it Moses Schiff later became agent for Isaac Speyer of Frankfort whom we have already mentioned On 2o Elul 1782 Letter V Moses Schiff thanks Speyer for what he has done for him and asks for further opportunities to act for him R Teveles adviser in this matter was R Jacob Rotterdam in London 474THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 475 who acted as agent for R Leb Haas 101 and J Schuster102 of Frankfort This Jacob Rotterdam had also business connexions with Jacob Homel  Co103 Letter IV It was R Teveles custom to send charitable gifts to relatives and poor people in his native town to which he remained attached all his life Through his brother he acted as intermediary between people in London and their relatives in Frankfort and even accepted lottery stakes from his friend Moses Munk in Frankfort and adds Falk shall insure it obviously referring to the BaalShem Samuel Falk Letter III Among the regular recipients of gifts from the Rabbi was his brother R Meir himself another brother Moses his sisterinlaw motherinlaw of his brother Meir and of his son Moses a certain Abraham Giessen and the widows of Moses Trumm and Moses Platz A certain Moses b Leb Zunz who lived in London asks the Rabbi to let his stepmother know he was astonished to hear she was not satisfied with the allowance he and his brother living in America sent her If however his other brother who is studying at the Yeshiba in Pressburg has any particular wish he should write to his brothers and send the letter to R Meir Schiff Letter II Reference is made to Abraham Emmerichs bankruptcy which greatly astonished the Rabbi who uses the phrase it is like fire in a cedartree nnn nmt rt aD104

See Kaufm Gluckel v Ham p xxxix 104 In Letter VII to Isaac Speyer R Tevele refers to the bankruptcy of a London firm of bankers named Brown  Collinson which involved a great many people Jews and nonJews See App V I i 2THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW book of the Frankfort BethDin He buys a seat in the Synagogue from Solomon Sinzheim in 1780 ibid p 114 b His brother Meir had some dispute with the iJ the treasurers of the Frankfort congregation and collected signatures in support of his plea R Tevele mentions several members of the Frankfort community who he thinks will sign the memorandum Their names are the children of M Scheyer 105 J Kulpa 106 Lima b Zalman Haas 107 David Cassel soninlaw of Z Cassel 108 Hirsch Haasl09 and his nephew M b S the Levi Madl and R Jacob Kannl10 In connexion with this dispute R Meir Schiff had complained to his brother that things had come to such a pass in Frankfort that many members gave up 5npn nptn their membership in the community to join small kehillas in the neighbourhood and R Tevele says  I am sorry for the place and the graves of my ancestors that such a state of affairs should have arisen It is not unlikely that this refers to the persecution of R Nathan Adler who a year or two previously I779 had been excommunicated and in the year when this letter was written 1782 left Frankfort to take up the Rabbinate in Boskowitz R Tevele remarks at the end of these references However all bad things nnlrn must pass some time or other and he considers it his duty to see to it 105 Moses Scheyer who died I Ijjar I775 Hor FG 3530

familys connexion with the community should be kept up for future generations and for this reason he did not allow his membership of the community to lapse Letter V On one occasion R Meir Schiff asked his brothers help to obtain the post as Rabbi in Copenhagen 1776 Letter I It is then that we hear who were R Teveles patrons at his election in London as he approaches them to do similar service to his brother in this matter and Aaron Goldschmidt writes to his nephew Jacob b Mendele Kik l in Hamburg who has reason to be thankful to his uncle he having assisted him greatly in his business connexions to recom mend his cousin R Meir Schiff to his friends and corre spondents in Copenhagen R Tevele himself composes the letter for Goldschmidt and sends a copy of it to his brother He remarks among other things that the fact of his not having been Rabbi but only Dayyan should not be regarded as a fault For R Tevele himself was only Dayyan in Frankfort when elected as Rabbi to London and thank God we are satisfied with our bargain R Tevele also addresses a letter to R Meir Hanover for the same purpose in which he mentions that he helped him to obtain his present position and was by this a means of his brother succeeding him as Dayyan in Frankfort In London there was only one merchant who had direct correspondence with Copenhagen writes R Tevele and that was a friend of the Rabbi of the Hamburger Hambro Synagogue Meshullam Zalman Emden To approach this man would be harmful to his cause as the family of the Haham Zevi would certainly try to obtain the post for one of their own family He had however approached M1 Probably Kiik cp Grunwald Hamburgs deutsche Juden p 270THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW a certain R Moses Wallich of London to write to his wifes stepmother the widow of R David Hanover who was a native of Copenhagen to write to her friends there The letter bore no result as R Meir Schiff remained Dayyan in Frankfort till the end of his days Before he obtained this post he was Dayyan in Vienna where he signs the Statutes of the HebrahKaddishah in I763 cp Mitt z jiid Volkskunde I91o Heft 33 p I3 R Tevele himself tried at least twice as far as we can ascertain to change his position In 1781 Letter III he aspired for the Rabbinate of Rotterdam and reproaches his brother for not doing anything for him in this matter The Rabbi of Amsterdam had apparently put some ob stacles in his way and who can stand up against this people he says pointing again to the Emden family the Rabbi of Amsterdam being then R Saul brother of R Hirschel Lewin The Rabbi of Halberstadt was elected but seems to have refused to go the postal service being very irregular in those days on account of the war between Holland and England he only received the news of this together with a letter informing him that the Rabbi of Emden had been elected This haste must have been intentional says R Tevele Half a year later Adar 1782 he was anxious to become Rabbi of Wirzburg but the letter he wrote was lost on a boat which was sunk by enemy action and he did not write again but would have no objection if R Meir could arrange it although it rests with God what is good for me and my son for our body and soul R Levi Fanto cp 3 i p 62 Dayyan in Prague had been elected to Wiirzburg but did not go there News did not travel fast in those days and R Tevele did not know of 478THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 479 the refusal until by accident he saw the signature of this R Levi on a letter addressed to him by the Rabbinate of Prague He writes thereupon to a friend of his R Moses Rofe in Wiirzburg inquiring for the reason of R Levis not going whether it was that the income from that Rabbinate had diminished of lateor for some other reason as he can point out to him some one who would be open to entertain an offer if made to him clearly referring to himself Letter IV R Levi Fanto died on 23 Teb 1782 of that however R Tevele was not aware of at the time ibid Of interest is also a reference in the same letter to a Jew who had lived in England somewhere in the country among nonJews and gave up all his property to the man he lived with for an annuity When the Rabbi Gershon Pulitz of Nikolsburgl12 was still alive he wrote to him asking for assistance for the mans sisterinlaw his late brothers R Jekls wife and children and R Tevele was successful in obtaining aid from the man whose name was David Fridland Some time later when his nephew Isaac son of the said brother Jekl came to England the transfer of his property had already taken place and he could not assist this nephew Only after his death this Isaac succeeded in getting some money from the man who had the property by a compromise but now there was no more hope of getting anything out of him This R Tevele writes to R Meir Schiff in answer to an inquiry and request for help for some one of Fridlands family We get a glimpse of the Rabbis homely character in the orders he gives to his brother in Letter II He did not consider it beneath his dignity to order half a dozen white cotton caps not striped but plain white Uotwnu tv3 112 Chief Rabbi of Moravia from I75372THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 11 DIVWE p1 N lnylp mur tuD neither should they be sable caps he adds which was probably meant as a jest We even find an order for half a dozen handkerchiefs but these should not be white on account of the snufftobacco His wife Breinle having been dead for years she died in 1772 see above he had to trouble himself with these domestic trifles The same letter No III contains a postscript by his wifes

titlepage of this work written by R Tevele himself which proves that he intended this name for his book Another manuscript containing answers to questions raised by the Tosafot against the

Zevi Hirschel Lewin and his wife Golde he was not quite three years old when his father left London for Halberstadt in the spring of I764 He was only eleven years old when his father entered into office in Berlin in I772 and there it was that the most important years of his early training were spent The Berlin community was then on a not much higher standard of culture and modern education than most of the Polish congregations of our days Mendelssohn and his circle met with opposition even in Berlin and although R Zevi Hirsch had recommended Mendelssohns German Bible translation he did not give his son Solomon a very extensive schooling in other matters than Rabbinics It is quite certain that R Solomon never possessed the title of Doctor from any University although he was generally styled as such in the later period of his life and often uses the title himself in his letters see later He became a recognized Rabbinical scholar and like his father and his brother Saul a master of Hebrew style He married at the age of seventeen Rebecca Koenigsberg and later became Rabbi of Prenzlau in Prussia The Rabbinate of the Great Synagogue was vacant after the death of Rabbi Tevele Schiff for a number of years There is no reliable record of the exact date of R Solomon Hirschels election While Mr Picciotto mentions I8o3119 119 Sketches p 307 484THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 485

rendered into English by Joshua Van Ovenl21 and this was as is stated there soon after R Solomons accession to office122 All these dates seem however incorrect according to the tombstone inscription of R Saul brother of R Solomon He is described as son of Rabbi Zevi Hirsch 1i Rabbi of Berlin formerly Rabbi of our congregation and brother of our Rabbi Solomon As R Zevi Hirsch died in I8oo and was still alive when the tombstone was set as indicated by the letters IN  may his light continue to shine R Solomon Hirschel must have come to London prior to I8oo cp 7QR NS vol IX p 408 One of his qualifications which made him particularly recommendable for the post was the fact of his having been born in London The Rabbinical duties at the Great Synagogue were in the interval discharged by the Rabbi of the New Synagogue Moses Myers died I804 nevertheless there seem to have been continual differences between the three Ashkenazi Synagogues and not the least reason for these frictions was the practice of enticing members of one Synagogue to another In 1804 an amalgamation of the three Synagogues as far as finances were concerned was contemplated by L de Symons but without success The only result achieved through the influence of the new 120 See The Present reign of the Synagogue of Dukes Place Displayed fc by Solomon Bennett London printed for and published by the author No 475 Strand

was an arrangement as to the contributions of the Synagogues towards the relief and burials of the poor These treaties were renewed every five years until in J838 a somewhat closer union of the three Ashkenazi congrega tions was brought about through the endeavours of Mr N M Rothschild The convention then signed did not constitute them into a United Synagogue as each congregation retained its independence The agreement chiefly referred to a concert of action in charitable matters and was in a way the forerunner of the Board of Guardians UnderRabbi Solomons guidance the community grew from day to day and the Dukes Place Synagogue was rightly called the Great Synagogue its development being the most marked He is reported to have been very tolerant towards the failings of others during the early days of his activity in London He did not repulse those who transgressed the Law but tried to influence them by kind words and often by a little pleasantry The story is told of a prizefighter who became a religious man through one kindly act of the Rabbi On Sabbath R Solomon wore a long white silk robe and was once clad like this on his way to Synagogue attacked by a few hooligans The Jewish prizefighter saw this and dispersed the crowd Thereupon the Rabbi took his rescuers arm and walked with him to Synagogue On being approached for having in this way shown appreciation of one who publicly trans gressed the Law he answered The path of repentance is open to all It is reported that from that day the prizefighter became an observant Jew Yet another tale of a different tendency has remained in circulation showing that where the observance of the Law and orthodox customs were concerned Rabbi Solomon knew no com 486THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 487 promise Asher Goldschmid one of the principal members of Dukes Place once wore his boots instead of slippers as is customary when called up to the Law on Atonement Day The Rabbi ordered him to descend from the reading desk It was Goldschmids custom to send the Rabbi a present of fish for every Succot On the eve of that festival following this YomKippur the Rabbi told his wife to buy fish as he did not think Goldschmid would send any The fish however arrived and with it an ornamental box containing a doctors certificate which stated that it would have been injurious to Goldschmids health had he worn slippers on YomKippur123 Especially strict was R Solomon as regards the religious conduct of the Shohetim MS Adler 2261 gives the names of those authorized by the Rabbi during the years 182242 and contains even some who were authorized by his suc cessor Dr N M Adler the latest date being Ab 1845 Every Shohet had to give the following undertaking I herewith undertake by giving my hand to the Rabbi that I shall not slaughter any animal where there is another Shohet authorized by the Rev Rabbi of London even for my own use I shall not do so At any time should the Rabbi forbid me if only by word of mouth even to slaughter I shall obey him at any place I may be I further promise not to shave my beard and not to drink wine that is not specially prepared for the use of Jews Some of the

in respect This was no more than he deserved His whole life was devoted to the care of his congregants Even their private interests were furthered by him where and whenever he could be of help to them We have fortunately in MS Adler 4160 a number of letters preserved which give us an account of the last 494THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 495 fourteen years of his life and activity This MS contains copies of letters of R Solomon in Hebrew and English dealing with family affairs and official correspondence The MS consists of 269 folios in large 4to of which fols 3995 98a Iooa 160b I65b I87a I89a are entirely blank while others are only half filled The English letters cover most of the written pages The dates extend from 5586 1826 till 5600 I840 He signs mostly S Hirschell not Herschell and the address of his resi dence is given as 5 Bury Court The MS represents a wealth of material not only for AngloJewish history but also for the History of the Jews in America always closely related to the same and to the Jews of Poland and Russia His correspondence with Poland was so large that he had to petition the Government in respect of letters sent to him without the postage having been paid by the sender This document is written on Nov i8 5588 I727 and is addressed to Francis Freely Esq MS Adler 4160 p 163 b and a few passages of the same may be quoted  In the first place I beg leave to acquaint the Honourable Board that having passed the early part of my life in study of several of the Jewish Colleges in Poland as well as having officiated for a time as Chief Rabbi in that country I became generally known throughout the several congre gations therein and having since been called to that office in p I63a this great and important metropolis it is a natural consequence that all those who have no com mercial or natural connexions in London fly to apply to me as a resort to assist their various wants or inquiries besides as the principle organ of Religious or Statistical regulations a considerable correspondence is necessarily imposed on me with respect to marriages divorces c cTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW those combined causes join to overwhelm me with letters which in no way concern me and induce an expense far beyond my means to supply and from my unwillingness to return letters which appear to have the most distant probability of being important to poor persons although unknown I am in possession of a considerable number for which I have paid the postage but which I neither know whom to deliver or expect to be repaid Great as this evil may be I should be content to sacrifice all that I can for the benefit of the many wretchedly poor persons who are concerned but the additional expense of the register renders this impossible and on this point I request more minutely to enter into explanation in order to account for the number that arrive under this increased expense It is greatly to be lamented that the Post Office regulations and certainly a great number of delivery of letters sent by that conveyance are in great number of foreign states far inferior to that of this countrys great commercial emporium but most particularly is it to be deplored throughout Poland and perhaps Russia and no where so much in respect the communications for the smaller towns and villages therein seldom does a letter from a private individual unless a regular commercial established house arrive at its destination whether the money received for postage is unaccounted for and the letter destroyed I will not venture to assert but certain it is that if any person wishes to insure its transit it has uniformly been found expedient to register the same as then the office receipt is brought back to the sender this part will account for the number of letters arriving with such a guarantee in this Country even from poor people to whom such letter is of vital importance so strong indeed 496THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 497 is this truth that I have very frequently lost many impor tant letters sent from my own family whom I have for bidden to register such warnings are found in many of the Hebrew and Yiddish letters of this MS eg pp Iob and 23b and very often receive letters from the cir cumatious  sorrow on that account The forbidding the parties to register is impossible as few come from the same source the number arriving are in great part from new and strange correspondents The evil of which I complain and hope for some arrangement to be made by the Honourable Board for my relief comprehending the levity to be wished for in behalf of the poor distressed correspondence is the charge made by the London Office for Registry which infinitely sur passes the postage I am quite alive to the possible opening this may form for fraud but the cases that come under my observation are in no way connected with mer cantile or commercial concerns The subjects generally consist of enquiries from wives after husbands children after parents subjects alas lately becoming too frequent in consequence of some severe Russian Decrees against our devoted nation or professional letters respecting divorces c c I am aware that in many instances where I have sent the parties themselves to claim their letters that the Registry fee has generally been remitted but I wish it to be understood that I have never purposely sent them with an expectation that such would be necessary consquence The Office must be best judge of its own actions Where a particular request from me should be presented stating the inability of the party to pay    What better proof is required for the saintly nature kind heart and at the same time for the honest business like manner of our Rabbi than this his own letter whichTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW I believe was written by his own hand although most of the English letters were written by others according to his instructions as he himself says in one of these letters That the Post Office authorities handed out letters from abroad to poor people without making them pay the postage was obviously done out of regard for R Solomon Hirschel and proves that he had influence even in nonJewish quarters Of this we have also other indications in this MS The Duke of Sussex was a great friend of the Jews reports were current that he knew Hebrew which he had studied under the Rev Solomon Lyon of Cambridge and that he read daily portions of the Bible in the grand old language in which it was originally written says Mr Picciotto Sketches p 286 Rabbi Solomon seems to have been well acquainted with him as we see from a letter which he sent to the Duke in 1840 after a dinner at the house of one of the Goldsmids The letter reads MS Adler 4160 p 106 a middle May it please Your Royal Highness I respectfully crave Your Royal Highness permission to offer my humblest apologies for having withdrawn from Mr Goldsmids without offering my humble duty to Your

never use nor have ever used human blood in connexion with any of their ceremonies The MS contains a copy of a letter ad dressed to Dr Hirschel by a Mr John Joseph Stockdale of Gloster Gate Regents

gists in the year of the world 21o6or when the Ld Gd Omnipotent constituted Abram and his seed by Isaac Gds peculiar people he appointed circumcision as the seal of such covenant Should no blood be shed in your rite of circumcision your oath is I admit literally correct but if circumcision induce blood I submit it to your consideration Although the writer adds Permit me to add I could not for an

wish were universal Pardon me who I am an unworthy Christian but not less an admirer of Gds peculiar people of whom your ancestors and Self for more than ten generations have been chief spiritual guides   pardon me I repeat the bold but not unholy intrusion pp 1045 We find no answer of the Rabbi recorded The writers bad faith was apparent for if he knew anything about Judaism and Jewish rites he must have known that evenTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW at the ceremony of circumcision the blood itself is not used but is washed off and dried up in the ordinary surgical way The Rabbi therefore probably thought it best not to answer for he did not believe in polemics with people of other faiths Such polemics could only bring about conflicts between the adherents of different religions The Rabbi says so plainly in a letter to Rev T Smith p 135 b which reads Dr Hirschells compts to the Rev Mr T Smith assures him that his occupations have been too multifarious to allow him to peruse the sermon sent and having long made up his mind not to enter into Polemical Correspondence on religious subjects seeing that each Party remain of the same opinion still and that they only produce and augment a bitterness of spirit he must decline replying to the questions proposed on the verses of Daniel which have so long been subjects of dispute and of acknowledged mystery Neither can he consider the tone of the second note enticing nor the threat of publication imperious enough to induce him to alter his resolution of avoiding all conflict between religionists 5 Bury Court Nov 25th 559I 183I The Rev T Smith was probably in league with the London Society for Promoting Christianity among Jews founded in I808 which at the time this letter was written unfolded a feverish activity among the Jews and not always without success The Rabbi although he did not enter into public discussions did his best through activity among his own congregants to frustrate the missionaries efforts

kind assistance in perhaps more than is in your power has thrown herself away with her 2 children But what is past can not be recalled Yet as the children have been so fortunate that their Father arrived from America and in the midst of great sorrow and calamity has tried to rescue the innocent children and has taken them out of the hands of everlasting ruin I feel it my duty knowing you for so many years always acting up to our religion in the strictest manner and never withheld your assistance to the poor where is there greater and important Charity than to save innocent children from the liands of 41D much more your own dear grandchildren which are considered as your own children that you will do what lies in your power to assist their Father to keep them Equally important is another letter addressed to a member of his congregation warning him not to attend meetings of supporters of the London Society p I46b The letter was written on Feb 22 1827 but no name is mentioned Sir Allow me from the nature of my Office as well as from my conscientious feeling to call your attention to the necessity of not only duly practising the duties of our holy religion but also of avoiding in places where contrary doctrines are held forth as it appears you have done by attending at a Meeting held by the supporters of the London Society where much was spoken by one who has abrogated the Jewish religion for reason best known to himself The presence of any Jew at such a meeting is not only improper in itself but gives an apparent sanction or approbation to it and however unTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW founded encourages a false hope in the practice that their preaching has effect Let me therefore caution you not to appear at any of such meetings lest it should appear as if you encouraged the system when you merely went from curiosity Provciv 15 mnnaDn 1r pn n2  1n ln iK 3 and let me direct your attention to the fifth chapter of Proverbs which alludes particularly

Christianity If he publicly atones and in the Synagogue declares that he again wishes to adhere to the Jewish faith and to the tenets of Jewish Religion he should be received in a friendly manner and supported in his efforts to again become a true and faithful member of the Jewish community A Society for the prevention of Juvenile corruption called itself likewise the  London Society and R Hirschel writes with reference to this p 2oi I need not add that your Society has my best wishes and that any assistance in my power will be readily afforded I would recommend that your circular be sent to each of the Synagogues in the Metropolis a list of which I add I must however beg 502THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 503 leave to observe that the designation London Society which you have adopted is rather felicitious unfortunate  as you expose your laudable association to be compounded with and mistaken for another London Society for promoting Christianity among the Jews for the confusion of ideas resulting from this similarity of designation may tempt many to identify you with the other London Society which certainly does not number many friends among us A missionary Mr Wolff by all appearances an apostate Jew receives the following letter in answer to a request for an interview p 144a Copy of an answer to Joseph Wolff a mis sionary for Palestine  Dr Hirschel acknowledges the receipt of Mr Wolffs letter but feels it is inconsistent with his official situation as it is incongrous sic  with his personal feelings that he should admit Mr Wolff to be capable of reporting any conversation between them on his return to Palestine  Dr H has however no objection to receive any obser vation Mr W may think for to communicate to him in writing The position of the Jews in the East and especially in Palestine was a very precarious one at the beginning of last century Cries for help fiom their starving brethren in the Holy Land reached the ears and hearts of the Jews all over the world A society called Pekidim and Amar kulim of the Jewish Congregations of the Holy Land was formed in Amsterdam under the presidency of R Zevi Hirsch Lehren I784I853 and his

understood from Mrs Emanuel that colonel Powell was desirous of personally to communicate with him which was the reason why Dr Hirschell appointed a time for the interview as his advanced age and

Rabbi In this connexion one letter of which my friend Mr E N Adler said it was quite classical is worth quoting in full The letter p 268 a is addressed to Master Elias who I ven ture to suggest was the son of Hazan D Elias of the Great Synagogue who had to resign his position on account of illhealth in I829 Picciotto Sketches p 333 The Rabbi writes That you are obstinate and unruly I have long known but that you would carry these faults to the extent you do I did not expect Recollect yourself and reflect on your situation Your only hope of ever becoming a useful member of society rests on your behaving properly during your apprenticeship and learning your trade as you ought Do this and I will still be your friend as I have been but if you will be disobedient and persist in your ill conduct I must decline assisting you or doing any more for you You know what trouble and anxiety I have had on your account and now I devote money and time for your welfare I have a right to expect that you should prove yourself worthy of my kindness which you can only do by proper behaviour to your Master If you quit him the money paid for you is lost and I shall certainly not do any thing whatever for you I therefore again repeat reflect on your situation your welfare or ruin depends upon your own conduct Be wise and show those who have befriended you for your fathers sake that their kind 508THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 509 ness has not been wasted on you If you do not bestow on my advice you will repent it when it is too late I am your wellwisher as you behave It is like the words of a father to his son that we hear spoken when we read these lines Amongst all his activities his infirmity and in the midst of his continuous study and arduous communal duties the Rabbi finds time to write a letter like this to a young boy whom he befriends And this was not the only boy whom he took under his care On p 206 a of the MS we find the copy of a letter to Messrs B and W Levy at Portsea dated Feb 9 A M 5597 written on behalf of a young boy named Elkin Gollin who was to be placed under the care of Messrs Levy The Rabbi would have liked the youngest brother of the boy to go to Portsea instead but Mrs Gollin not being willing to send her youngest son in answer to yours of the 24th ult concerning Elkin Gollin I beg to say that Mrs Gollin is agreeable to send him to your care and I trust that under your protection he will do as well You are no doubt aware of his being much younger than his brother Elias and I hope therefore that your fostering kindness may be extended watchfully over him were it possible I should be desirous of having a little conversation with you whereby you might explain many points to me   The rest of the letter deals with the question whether a Jew having a nonJew as partner may allow the business to be open on the Sabbath day and the Rabbi replies in the affirmative with the reservation that the contract between the partners must clearly state that the profits made on the Sabbath day belong solely and exclusively to the nonJewish partner Another document p I84 b dated June 6 5596 1836THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW reveals the Rabbi as peacemaker between father and son I should have replied to your letter earlier but waited in hopes being enabled to affect a reconciliation between yourself and your family  I have and am yet willing to do all in my power to make Peace in the mean time you must not forget that it is your duty to open the road and to strive strain every nerve to bring about the required object you are anxious to obtain The letter is addressed to the son and I do not think it is a coincidence that the names of persons are omitted in the copies of private letters He was so anxious to guard the secrets of others that he would not even entrust to his private copybook the names of the people concerned The letter of the Rabbi had the result hoped for if as we may assume the letter following on the next page 185 a dated June 15 5596 refers to the same people This letter is addressed to a brother of some one who had had a dispute with his parents I am happy to find that my letter has produced the desired effect indeed nothing affords me more pleasure than to promote peace and goodwill among my flock and much more between Father and Son and I hope that this will at all events have the happy effect of teaching people to be more cautious before they take an oath which I am inclined to think too frequently occurrs from their acting from the impulse and passion and not attaching that importance to the sacred name which as human beings they ought to do and next to this in the words of the divine Psalmist  How beautiful and pleasant for Brethren to dwell together in harmony  I can assure you that my pleasure will not be a little increased by you and your Brother entering the compact and hence forward feeling towards each other as Brothers and men ought to do 5ioTHE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 511 A similar letter follows very likely relating to the same people bearing no date and no names of this I shall only note the postscript NB This letter will be handed you by Mr Cohen to whom I have instructed to tell you that Immediately after the Post is in you will call on your Parents and ask their forgiveness and also write to your Brother and thank him for his interference I have written to them on that head and trust that after all unfriendly feelings betwixt the families will be done away with Should your parents not be at Portsmouth you will imme diately on receiving this write to them and also to your Brother thanking him for his interference The beginning of the letter reveals the cause of the fathers anger I this day received a letter from your Brother of Southampton by which I was more than happy to find that your respected father is likely to be reconciled to the Marriage which you are about to celebrate I hope to your happiness and prosperity having done all my efforts to produce this desired end I feel it now my duty to call on you religiously to perform your part and as we hope to be forgiven our sins on our nmin day so we must do our part to merit it I have reproduced the last sentence for the purpose of preserving this old and beautiful Jewish tradition which I think is almost forgotten To enable the young couple to enter the sacred state of matrimonial life in perfect purity of heart and purpose God forgives them all their sins on the wedding day That is the reason why both bride and bridegroom fast on the wedding day till after the ceremony an introductory part of which is that both say the afternoon prayer for the eve of Atonement day with the full confessional prayers Among the professional Rabbinical letters we findTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW several addressed to R Akiba Eger of Posen to whom he sent money for distribution to relatives of London Jews living in Poland to R Efraim Zalman Margolies of Brod to the Rabbi of Lemberg whom he calls cousin and to the Rabbi of Paris p 250 Many of these letters refer to the divorce of his daughter Fegele of which we shall hear later He had

forming shareholders that the third call of 30s per share is now made dated Nov 27 1837 discloses that the Rabbi must have had some interest in these shares A great deal of trouble must have caused

lines Already as early as 182I a petition for the shortening of the Misheberach signed by several members of the Synagogue was submitted to the managing committee The petitioners were anxious to improve the decorum of the Synagogue They call the institution of Misheberach a system of finance for which the most solemn prayers are hurried over and which is inconsistent with decorum and public order This was a sign of the times a beginning of the modernization of AngloJewry which ultimately ended in the establishment in I84Iof the Reform Synagogue Although most of the founders of the West London Synagogue were members of the Sephardi congregation threefourths the secession was more keenly felt by the Ashkenazi community R Solomon Hirschel issued a caution on Sept 9 1841 stating that persons calling themselves British Jews pub licly and in their published book of prayers reject the Oral Law and further that any person or persons declaring that he or they reject and do not believe in the authority of the Oral Law cannot be permitted to have any com munion with us Israelites in any religious rite or sacred act Picciotto tells us on unimpeachable authority that the Rev S Hirschel as well as the Rev D Meldola signed the above paper with the greatest reluctance know ing that it would cause much exasperation c and even after the Rev S Hirschel had been induced to affix his signature to the document he wished to recall it The caution was not promulgated for some time On Saturday Jan 22 1842 it was read publicly in the principal Synagogues Sketches p 380 Picciotto apparently knew only of the first caution dated 24 Elul 5602 I841 andTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW issued soon after that date The caution read on Jan 22 was a second one dated 9 Heshvan 5602 Oct 24 I84I133 The Herem was read in all the Synagogues exceptwhich is worth notingin the Western Synagogue Haymarket where the wardens refused to have it read The Reform Synagogue was nevertheless established and the Herem was afterwards confirmed again by the late Dr N M Adler in 1846 The stand taken by R Solomon in connexion with this secession from the orthodox Synagogue was about the only part he took in the public life of the London com munity His whole life was devoted to the study of the Torah and the exercise of the holy Law From early morning till late at night often till long after midnight he was bending over the large folios of the Talmud Of a keen intellect he was more a receptive than a productive scholar and too much absorbed in his studies to find time for writing works No complete work of his remained after him the products of his studies were only notes on the margins of the books he read of which so far nothing has been published He was rather tall and of commanding appearance in his long robe and broad hat but was rarely seen except on his way to and from Synagogue He lived an ascetic life and it is said that for years he did not eat meat from Sabbath to Sabbath and fasted every Monday and Thursday throughout the year134 In I825 Salom J Cohen published the book Elements of Faith in Hebrew with an English translation by Joshua Van Oven The publication was approved of by 183 See W Ayerst The Jews of the Nineteenth Century London 1848 pp 311 ff 134 Voice of Jacob II p 59 514THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 515 Rabbi Solomon Hirschel and Haham Raphael Meldola It is necessary writes R Sol Hirschel in his Hebrew appro bation dated I Kislev 5575  1814 to make the Jewish youth acquainted with the elements of our faith especially in this country I have examined the book carefully and much approve of it This book and Rabbi Solomon Hirschel for recommending it were attacked by a man named Yomtof Bennet in a pamphlet entitled ntnp 3 z  A basket of Criticism London I827135 Yomtof Baneth or as he called himself in English Salomon Bennett was a native of Polotzk in White Russia and after having been to Riga Copenhagen Berlin and Paris came to London in I799 He claimed to possess a patent as Royal Academician of the Berlin Academy in his profession as engraver He had acquired some Hebrew knowledge in his youth but was not an observant Jew As orthodoxy was not a favourite theme of mine he says of himself particularly as a foreigner and a single man who cannot abide by all the strictness of ceremonial laws I was then declared a heretic136 He found friends among the  English Gentlemen who were divested of religious and national prejudices but still he took a lively interest in Jewish com munal affairs apparently to a greater degree than was agreeable to the community itself He says that Rabbi Solomon Hirschel carried hatred against him in his bosom 135 Another controversial pamphlet appeared in I808 under the title The Axe laid to the Root or  Ignorance and superstition evident in the character of the Rev S Hirschell High Priest of the Jews in England in several letters to him on occasion of his having ordered the trees to be felled in the old burialground at Mile End Road The author was Levi Alexander Bibl Angl ludaica p II2 136 See Present Reign c p 4 I am indebted to Rev M Rosenbaum for calling my attention to this rather rare pamphletTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW since his stay in Berlin on account of some dissension between Bennett and his father Rabbi of that metropolis R Hirschel he complains caused him losses of money of above one hundred pounds and imprisonments on account of his portrait I have not been able to discover what portrait this refers to In the pamphlet Tene Bikkurim the English title of which is A Collection of Rabbinical Discussions and Criticisms Bennett accuses the Rabbi of having given his approbation to a book which did not contain the elements of faith but in many instances elements of unbelief p i6 In answer to this pamphlet Mayer Cohen Rintel published a booklet called nlip inmn London 1817 printed by Jechiel Hanau Bassist of the Great Synagogue in which he vindicates the writer of the Elements of Faith and the Rabbi It is quite possible that the whole defence was prepared by Rabbi Solomon Rintel being a Shohet and under his jurisdiction At least Bennett says so in the reply which he published under the title The Present Reign of the Synagogue of Dukes Place displayed Rintel in his Minhat Kenaot speaks of the Rabbi in very respectful terms I know the mind of our revered Rabbi well he says he is a Zaddik who follows in the footsteps of his famous forefathers He is a man Dn rWNv without pride not being pleased with praises but he also does not grieve when he is blamed and does not mind being criticized I cannot however stand by and see our revered and esteemed leaders honour attacked Bennetts account of R Solomon is naturally quite different but his charges are after all not so very serious the principal one being that he cannot speak English and that he had not yet published any literary work His 516THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 517 picture of London Jewry however may be of some interest When he arrived there he tells us he found the doors of Jewish houses barred against him in spite of recom mendations from friends on the Continent It is a theme in their religious sentiments if a Jew be not orthodox in the extreme they proclaim him to be an infidel on the other hand a man may commit all depredations and im moralities if he eontributed to and attended the Synagogue he is then they say  a good Idde Kiend  Would I have been qualified to be a good companion to associate in their convivialities to give an Italian a French or German song would I possess gallant politeness undoubtedly I might obtain their friendship but alas I was never educated to such fineries The causes of these views he explains by a further statement that his brethren entertained an inherent hatred against him and on which score he had never met with any cordiality from them That proud Pontiff R Solomon Hirschell even formed prosecutions and plans with those who cringe under his government to obstruct all intercourse among my nation and all this on account of the small work entitled Tene Bikkurim He Solomon Hirschel became enraged like a tiger and having been unsuccessful among the Chief Rabbis with respect to an anathema he had that poultryslayer Mayer Cohen a member of the Petticoat Lane gentry to compose the book mwnp nmn  Avenge Offer The anathema was refused by the Rabbis the Haham Raphael Meldola and by R Zalman Bahur and Wolf Lissa of the German Jewish Synagogue One wretched

learning but rather an exhibition of rabbinical books constitutes his Rabbiship38 He presented an inventory of his Rabbinical library with no other views than to dazzle the sight of his illiterate adherents as if possessing an extensive stock of learning exclusively of his council to consult on every trivial law namely R Zalman Bahur R Wolf Lissa Z Mousse Croutchick Muday c It is Mr Witherby cp

seeing that the Royal Exchange the Stock Exchange and the Coffee houses adjoining are all filled with Jewmerchants transact ing business on the Sabbaths and holy days quite public The Rabbi is also aware that the most part of the Jewmerchants transact business in their counting and warehouses on the Sabbath days without exception that Jewish shopkeepers many of them keep their shops open on the Sabbath day  I have very often seen myself he says Jewish picture dealers of pretended piety furniture and clothsellers attend public sales on the Sabbath day all without blushing before the Christian community and yet our pious grand Rabbi never rebukes the generality or any individuals 137 See Bennets Present Reign pp I214 138 Ibid p 19 518THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 519 for doing so And why We have sufficient reason to conjecture because it would not answer so well his purpose or because his followers would look upon him with a frown139 Better still than these outbursts are his state ments in the Appendix from which I cannot refrain from quoting a few sentences People at large run away with a notion a man of high station in life when speaking of a modern Jewish Rabbi whom they vulgarly call the High Priest In my country viz White Russia and Poland in general this title of grand Rabbi is quite a legend with the Israelitish public and I do not hesitate to assert that taking on an average one out of two are men of letters sufficiently qualified to direct themselves and their brethren so as to live according to the ritual laws of Israel All the towns of the mentioned countries have chosen their Rabbis and teachers out of their own Israelitish inhabitants But different is the case in this country scarce one out of a hundred of the native Jews who though they understand a smattering of the Hebrew language yet understand not the Hebrew rites and their liturgy in general is quite out of the question The Rabbies c functions all must be far fetched viz from foreign countries Nor is it necessary for a Rabbi in this country to be over stocked with difficult learning as every dispute even between brother and brother comes before the Magistrate and Law courts With vehemence I exclaim Alas That the whole Hebrew literature is at stake with my people 139 Ibid p 56 Sol Bennet published also the following works Constancy of Israel 1812 A Discourse on

speak for or against that which was decreed by the rich people All this is applied to R Solomon Hirschel Now for the happy year 1802 London stood in want of the article Rabbi acordingly some of the Jewish merchants the friends of the Rabbi at Berlin recommended his son the Rabbi of Prentzlow to the Jewish merchants in London Among the eminent literati were such as Abraham Benjamin and Asher Goldschmids Amshell and Lizer Kysers Samuel Joseph c Having been proclaimed by these authorities Pontiff of Dukes Place a stop must have been put to any inquiry whatsoever and whosoever Solomon Bennets attacks did the Rabbi very little harm His charges were all clearly inspired by personal motives and it mattered little whether Bennet considered him a great scholar or not I have quoted the foregoing statements of Bennet in order to preserve the names mentioned therein some of them wellsounding to this day in AngloJewry and in order to depict the state of affairs in the community as they appeared to him part at least of what he says must have been in accordance with the facts R Solomon Hirschels mode of life was very simple and modest and he was able to save  14000 which is the amount of his estate left on his death About two years before he died he accidentally fell and broke his thigh 520THE GREAT SYNAGOGUE LONDONDUSCHINSKY 521 and never quite recovered from the shock Two months before his death he fell again while walking in his room and broke his collarbone The effect of this fall caused his end on Monday the 27th of Heshvan 5603  Oct 31 1842 in his eightyfirst year His wife Rebecca Koenigsberg had predeceased him by ten years She died Wednesday 6th of Tammuz 1832 just while his son Saul who had settled in Sandorhishel province of Posen was in London on a visit to his parents Saul fell ill during the week of mourning and died shortly afterwards in London at the age of thirtythree He was one of the Rabbis youngest children Of his wife the Rabbi always speaks with great respect and affection and his married life seems to have been a very happy one On one occasion he writes to his son David Tevele who was his eldest and most troublesome son that he would not have answered his letter had not his mother said a good word in his favour MS A 4160 p 256 He had four sons and four daughters The sons were David Tevele Saul Ephraim and Zevi Hirsch The daughters were Golde Shendel Fegele and another who apparently remained unmarried and died some twenty years ago at Ramsgate David Tevele married the daughter of Isaac son of Jonah Reich of Gumbinnen A daughter of his marries in I827 and his father sends him 500 florins towards her dowry and 1oo florins for wedding expenses David does not seem to have been reliable in business and his father sends the money to his soninlaw Samuel Zeliker in Warsaw with the order not to hand it over until the weddingday MS A 4I60 pp 25b26a The son belittled this contribution from his father and he writes himself a letter and in addition induces his sister Shendel of Rava to plead on his behalf VOL X MmTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW The fathers answer has some reference to his own position in London w b5n nn n iS y itK ln

the little possessions I have in silver and books I do not deny having them but I wish I could afford to sit quietly live a retired life and should have enough to live on from my income to throw off the yoke of the Rabbinate from my shoulders which I can hardly bear any longer on account of the heavy work and amount of trouble apart from my weak state of health and the aggravation I have on account of the religious laxity and shamelessness which has become frequent in our days on account of our sins Is it not as if we heard the Rabbis father speak seventy years previously MS 4160 p 26 a

province of Posen and died in London in 1827 The third son called himself Ephraim London and lived in TysmeniSa in Galicia The youngest son was Zevi Hirsch For some time he was a winemerchant in Cracow and supplied wine to his father in London MS A 4160 p 13 a afterwards he settled like his eldest brother in Jerusalem Zevi Laz P 177 The eldest daughter Golde was married to Samuel son of Nahum Zelliker in Warsaw and seems to have been in good circumstances They were as mentioned the agents of their father for distributing money from London Jews to relatives in Poland On one occasion the Rabbi received a complaint from the senders that too much commission was deducted in Warsaw for a transmittance and instead of io8 thaler I2 gr only 102 thaler 20 gr were received The Rabbi warns his children not to do it in future and appends some very sound morals as regards behaviour in business They should not try to make too much out of one transaction and in the case of trans mittance of money from him which mostly is done in the interest of poor people they should not charge anything except the actual commission charged to them Who knows how many have sinned in such matters it is better to be economical and to lead a simple life always to spend less than ones earnings so as to be able to save little by little If our sages say that even the most liberal man should not give more than a fifth of his possessions for charity how much less justified is anybody to spend more than MmTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that for outward appearances I was myself also a young man once and had money but I would never do a thing like this It is true I lost money otherwise I never had the idea to become a Rav indeed I intended to become a wine merchant at a time when I had offers of several Rabbinates but I wanted to live on my own earnings although I could at the time already stand up and hold my own among Hebrew scholars and also among people of Dln ancient families we need not be ashamed but God said it should be and so I had to become a Rabbi My opinion has not changed even now and I still hope he will enable me to live a retired life so that I can serve Him for the rest of my days with all my soul and all I have This letter was written on the 27th of Tebet 5587 I827 There are several other letters written to this soninlaw and daughter dealing with remittances of moneys to Poland pp 5 b 14 b I8 b 21 b 22 a 27 b3I a The second daughter was Shendel married to R Michael Rawer of Rawa This soninlaw stood not in great favour with our Rabbi On one occasion he writes he would send her some money to go to a wateringplace for the benefit of her health fl Ioo and if that is not enough her husband and his father should also give her something towards the expenses The third daughter Fegele or Feige caused him anxiety and trouble for many years In 1827 she married in Poland at the same time as her niece the daughter of her brother David Tevele p I3b The name of her husband is not mentioned but we know that he was a grandson of Rabbi Akiba Eger of Posen being the son of R Solomon Eger in Warsaw39 a with whom R Solomon Hirschel stood in frequent correspondence MS

him on the back of a business letter to some one in the provinces He mentions in the letter the towns of Hamburg and Herzburg Hirschberg in Posen but we cannot gather from the same where she lived The father would like to know whether she could send him from her place Hungarian wine as he thinks that his son Hirsch of Cracow takes advantage of him ibid p 34a In 1836 we hear that her husband had become insane The Beth Din of Brod Brody in Galicia was ready to arrange her divorce as it is stated he was sometimes quite sane but they required to be well paid for it as they held the Rabbi of London to be a very rich man Rabbi Solomon Hirschel writes to the Rabbi of Lemberg no name is mentioned on the 22nd of Elul 5596 thanking him for the hospitality he granted to his daughter and asks him to further the matter but in a reasonable way as he was not a rich man and did not feel justified to sacrifice all he had for one child while his other children were also in need of help from him

of Cornhill who also produced a bronze bust a few inches high With R Solomon Herschel passed away the last of the old Rabbinical school After his death the community was of opinion that it required as Chief Rabbi a man who not only possessed deep Jewish learning and was versed in the depths of Talmud and Halakah but who was at the same time a man of classical and general attainments of ability to understand and discretion to use the times and will be able to organize the elements under him142 The choice of the community fell after nearly two years of deliberations on the late Dr N M Adler

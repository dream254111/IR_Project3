Desert of Gobi By C M GRANT FJSq Read Decenlber 8 1862 TOWARDS the close of my stay in China in 1861 I passed several months at Tientsin after the ratification of the Treaty and while awaitint the issue of passports for the interior I made a trip to the Great WVall in the direction of Alanchuria and followed its course br about 40 miles In this quarter it is built of brick having a granite foundation I measured it several times anl found it always to be the same width about 15 feet I passed through numerous large towns and found a warm mineral sprillt at a place called Tangclluen situated at the foot of a hil over which the Great Vall passes This is a resort of persons sufferirlg from cutaneous diseases who bathe here The heat of the water is about 100 Fahrenheit The spring is within the precincts of a Buddhist temple and a set of baths of various dimelasions have been built round it From thence I went to visit the Imperial Buryingground of the present dynasty near a town called Mala boo but on presenting myself at the gates I uTas told that I could not be allowed permission to enter Upon this I vvent to the chief Mandarin to pay my visit and to ask leave to see the country but after a complimentary visit to that dionitary was unable to obtain perlnission My readiness to accept his explanations had hov ever put him in such good humour that he despatched a very handsomely worded letter to Prince Kung respectinO nzy conduct of which a copy was sent me Immediatelv after the receipt of tllis I made application for a passport for Mongolia It was at first reffused on the trollnd that the lMongols were not all thoroughly subdued However I was prepared to take all risks on myself and at the end of three weeksw thanks to the perseverance of Mr Bruce I was provided at Pekin with a Chillese passport bearing the Imperial chop and an English passport for Russia vise by the Russian Alinister lhrough tile kindness of one of the members of Eer Majestys Legation I was enabled to procure two bagtagecarts and two mulechairs  The latter is an oblong vehicle 6 to 7 feet in length and 3 feet high There are windows of cotton on each side anal the door is in frollt After having care fully arranged his bed the traveller enters and places himself in a reclining position  the machine is then raised by means of two strong wooden or bamboo poles which are fastexled orle on each side and which form shafts into which two mules ale yoked one in front and one behind The formrard and backwald move ment causel by the jogging of these animals makes the motion ver disaoreeable  but it must be admitted that the mulechair is much more comfortable than the springless carts It is a great incotlvenience however tilat it is necessary to un yoke one of the mloles before it is possible to descend168 GRANTS Journey fr om Pekin to St Petersburg lklarcAl 26 1862 I started from Pekin at 10 w3X Sllotl after passing the outer fortifications a naost violent duststorln arose which heinhtened in its fury so sllddenly that before I had pro ceeded a mile from the ityWall I found that the baglrage mules were unable to contend with it I therefore soucrht shelter at an inn and after a little perseverance obtained accommodation Here I was detained twenty hours urlable to sleep and sufferirlg intensely from the effects of the sand and the cold which was very severe March 27 At daybreak the storm began to abate and on rising at seven oclock I found the thermometer at 24 Fahr Although the wind continued high it was unaccompaniel by sand so I made a start The ravages of the storm were perceptible ill every direction large trees Bere uprooted hedges thrown down and houses unroofed In some spots the sand hal formed mounds varying from one to sis feet in height and parts of the road were so completely covered over that it was impossible to trace it At 6 PM I reached Hankow 20 miles fiom Pekin where I was lucky enough to find a good inn AIczrch 28At 6 AM the thermometer stood at 30 Fahr at 3 PM 54 HallkowS where I halted this day is situated at the mouth of the Kwankow Pass and was formerly a strongly for tified military station A subbranch of the Great Vall passes throuCh it March 29 The cold having abated we started for the Kwan kow Pass rhe track through this pass is 15 miles in length It is very rugged and tortuous always difficult in some places dangerous It is a rare occurrence for vehicles to cross this pass without some accident happening and my experience would lead me to recommend that any traveller followillffl in my footsieps should avail himself of a cooliechair I rode across but had I known at starting what kind of path was before me I should cer tainly have ordered a chair Great numbers of Chinamen in compallies passed me carrying large cases On inquiry I dis covered that these fbrmed part the rest having beell sent on befbre of ten thousand stand of rifles which the Russian Govern ment had engaged to give to the Chinese in part consideration of the cession to the Russians of the ccllntry lying north of the Alnoor I also learnt with pleasure that these arms should have been delivered two years previously but that the Russians had withheld them so that they might not be used against the Allied armies nf England and France The mountainscenery on each side of the track thouth not grand may be described as bold But the feature I was most pleased with Yas a large frozen waterfall It was the first I had ver seen and the sun shining upon it gave it a most beautiful andacross the Desert of Gobi 169 striking eSect The occasional streams were frozen nearly a foot thick itl some places although the heat had already begun to thaw the surface Several droves of Tartar ponies of from 300 to 400 head each passed ule today on their way to Chinese markets They were very strong wiry little animals and I was given to understand that I might purchase them at three dollars a head or alDout thirteen shillings At a very narrow part where the track was precipitous and uneven I met a Atongol Alandarin of the blue button in charge of about two hundred coolies bearing cases of arms and four ammunitionboxes EIe very angrily orderel my people to stop whilst I told them to go on Our opposition svas alJout to terminate in an encounter when my sersant interfered antl repre sentel me as Tayingko rienfung the great Englishmall of Heavenly abundance Tienfung was the name by whicil I was kllown in China All foreigners are named anew soon after their arrival in the Celestial Empire The path was immediately clearel for us and the AIandarin and I salutel each other with a chinchin Passed throuh a gateway of the main portion branch of the Great AVall The WVall here is in an excellent state of preserva tiOll At 2 PAI arrived at Chetow the first village to the north of the pass boasting a very large inn which presented an appearance of great bustle About two hundred donkeys were being laden to go through the pass Chetow lies in a spacious highly culti vated amphitheatre the hills surroundint which robed irs the softest anl most varied hues were hemlned in by a backgrourjd of distant snowcapped mountains which reflected the rays of the evening sun forming a landscape of singular beauty and grandeur Yuliang which I next passed iS a small fortified town of one street apparently a Illilitalay station On approaching Hulayen is a ternple on the top of an isolated rock having a great resem blance in the distance to Dumbarton Castle Here I stoppel for the night March 30 Fahr 46J to 829 Started from Hulayen pro nounced Whylien at 7 AM Passed ratumah a town which seems to have been of some importance but which is now very dilapidated and almost forsaken Passed successively Sachung a large fortified markettown Tupali and Paotnan a fortified town situated between Sachung and KeeMing which is invariably placed 20 miles to the eastward of its actual position Here is made the Wongchu a

At one point when rounditlg the apparently impassalule corner of a rock we found the patll only just wide enough to allow a passage between high cliSs on the one side and on the other a rapid current Sometimes the road is lery steep and should one of the saddleanimals make a false step its rider would be very apt to be precipitated into the boiling stream beneath In the sprinr when the snow melts this stream attains the dimensions of a large river Iassed several coalpits in operation today The coal is not of a very good description being small and scaley Avril 1 SuenhoFu which I reached

the Yamun for half an hour I was admitted He was a surly old fellow of the pink lutton and I was very much disgusted with him I asked him to render me asbist ance in procurinffl calllels He told me to apply to my hotel keeper that he had nothing to do with it I wished to be furnished with a passport in the lIongol language he told me through his Secretary that it was unnecessary and that I had nothing to fear The Mandarins to the east of Pekin had shown me esery courtesy in their power givint me cavalryescorts and extra servants besides orlering that I should be well received wherever I went This old fellow on the contrary appeared almost disposed to throw obstacles in my way I observed here many tons of tea which were being prepared for transport to Russia It is said that both tlle import alld export trade of Russia is on the decrease but notwithstanding this the Russians have the contl acts for tile superior qualities of teas and I am inclined to think they will continue to keep them as they pay such far highelz prices than other foreigllers and have besiles the advantage of a rery old connexion with the people who grow the best teas Excellent otatoes are grown here and very fine beef and mutton are also to be procured Extensive mines of silver and copper have been worked in Shi wallze but are llOWs I believe discontillued for State reasons In the neighbourhood of

They asked me 170 taels or about 575 blt my serr7ant persuaded them to reduce this demand to 110 taelsabout 351 Both my servants declined to cross the desert with me being afraid of the effects of the

panorama is pre sented to the viesv over the wildest and most majestic mountai scenery rhe Great Wall crosses this desolate spot but the ravages of time have alrllost levellel it with the ground After gazing our fill we gradually descellded to a distance of about 26 miles frorrl Kalgan where lying under the slope of a fertile hil we arrived at a caravan of one hundred sleeping camels In a dirty tattered tent a bright fire illumine the faces of a dozen Mongols who were seated around it on their haunches each bol in hand anxiously expecting the evening meal After tasting their soup I returned

travellers to take these with them as presents Mcty 5 to 8Our track lay through high mountains where we sas nurnerous herds of deer Starting alone to shoot hares whieh are numerous here I observed as

Mongolia is visible in the distance situated in a valley one side of the mountains covered with fir trees the other side perfectly barren On arriving at Ourga I presellted myself at the Russian Consu late where I was very hospitably received The Consul who stveaks French was absent but I made myself tolerably well un derstood to the acting Consul by means of the Mongolian language An elegant phaeton drawn by a splendid Arab which had made the journey fisom India wia China proper and the desert of Gobi was placed at my disposal and what with driving billiards and good living I passed at urga t1vo very pleasant days The Russian establishment numbers about twelve persona There is a colony of Chinese and about 25000 Mongols 10000 of whom are priets Eacll family educates one of its children as a priest he is looked upon as a gentleman and is not sllpposed to do hard work I hired four camels here to take me to Kiachta at which place I arrived irl four days over a road so vvellknown that I need not describe it as the scenery and ordinary incidents of travel upon it have been frequently laid before the general reader From Kiachta I proceeded to Lake Baikal which I crossed in 8 hours in a steamer thence to Irkutsk and by Krasnoyarsk to Tobolsk where during an inunzlation of the great river Obi I took steamer to Tumen in about 62 N Hence I returned to Europe by Ekaterinburg near which I visited the celebrated mines of the Demidof family at Nishni Tagilsk where within a radius of 10 miles iron copper gold platinum and precious stones are found and thence by Kasan and St Petersburg Actual time of travel from Pekin to Kiachta 46 days Distance not stated I had long been convinced that a more rapid communication between China and England could be attained by the adoption of the overland route via Mongolia and Siberia and it was tnainly with a view of carrying out this idea that I gathered on my journey every information bearing on the subject Although the foregoing is a very rude and irllperfect sketch the experiences of that journey have fully corroborated my previous anticipations r egarding the practicability of a courier express being organised across the desert of Gobi similar to that adopted in America between the Mississippi and California But even this improved means of communication will it is anticipated give place ere lont to a perfect system of electric telegraphy between London St Petersburg Moscow Kiachta Pekin and the Taku Forts across tAle Desert of Gobi 177 VOL XXXIII N

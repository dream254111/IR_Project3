j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1008723,Reasonable Railway Rates,i242494,REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES So many and various are the phases from time to time developed by the multitude of individual contributions to current discussion of what is known as the Railroad Problem  that there is grave danger of forgetting at least temporarily that the only adequate cause for the prevailing widespread dissatisfaction with the methods adopted by those officially in charge of railway properties and the relations between railway corporations and their patrons is public discontent resulting from the charges exacted for railway transportation Much is heard from those interested as owners or managers of railway properties in denuncia tion of what are termed legislative attacks upon those properties and many harsh names such as confiscatory legislation are perhaps not always without justification applied to what are in reality honest although often mis taken attempts to secure to the public by legislative action more satisfactory rates While it is undoubtedly true that many attempts at statutory regulation of railways have been unwise and therefore productive of evil rather than good it must be admitted that the popular inspiration of such measures has been consequent upon dissatisfaction with rail way charges and could have arisen from no other cause because in no other respect do the railways affect so large a portion of the people Upon the other hand an important section of the press and many popular leaders are constant and vehement in their attacks upon the socalled evils of overcapitalization stockwatering unnecessary construction improvident and wasteful management consolidations agree ments to maintain rates or divide traffic etc which even if serious evils in themselves can only operate injuriously upon a limited number of individuals unless their effects extend to the charges for transportation 33520 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY There can be no doubt that were the public entirely satis fied with the rates charged for the transportation of persons and property by rail little general interest would be taken in matters of mere railway economy and their discussion would be relegated to meetings of boards of directors rail way associations and those technical journals which are devoted to transportation It is axiomatic that an accurate diagnosis of the disease to be cured is an essential preliminary to the application of a proper remedy and whoever would prescribe adequately for the railway malady will do well to bear constantly in mind that no matter how complicated the symptoms occasionally disclosed the restoration of public content with railway methods can be accomplished only through measures which affect directly the rates and charges for transportation Popular dissatisfaction with railway charges does not arise from the fact that they are universally or even generally excessive Railway rates in the United States are generally lower than anywhere else in the world much lower than they were here five ten or fifteen years ago and quite as low as is consistent with the maintenance in an efficient condition of roadbed and equipment the payment of fair wages and any even approximately adequate return to the capital invested During the six years covered by the reports of the Bureau of Statistics of the Interstate Commerce Commission the average rate per ton per mile charged for the transportation of freight declined from IooI cents to 878 cent and that per passenger per mile from 2349 to 2 IO8 cents Incon siderable as these reductions appear when stated in this form they represent a saving to the public upon the traffic carried during the year ending June 30 I893 of II5II3 377 on freight and 34292 I34 on passenger transportation a total of I4940555 I in one year an amount exceeding by nearly fifty millions the total of all dividends paid on rail way stock and equal to seventythree per cent of the entire 336REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES customs revenue of the United States Government during that year It should be remembered that these reductions were effected within a comparatively short period and one during which sixty per cent of all railway stock capital received no dividends An exhaustive study of changes in railway freight rates since i852 was recently made under the direction of the Committee on Finance of the United States Senate the results of which published as a Senate document consti tute an exceedingly important contribution to the available information regarding railways The importance of this investigation the only one of the kind ever undertaken led to its being placed in charge of Mr C C McCain now auditor of the Interstate Commerce Commission a gentle man of wide experience and thorough knowledge of railway affairs whose name is sufficient testimony to its accuracy Mr McCain briefly summarizes the results of this investiga tion as follows  From all the forms of comparison presented it is clearly demon strated that there has been a constant downward tendency in freight charges in all sections of the country Data contained in this report fairly illustrate the reduc tions that have taken place during the period investigated The references in this paper cover an exceedingly small fraction of the matter included and the report itself should be carefully studied by any one desiring to be fully informed concerning the history of railway freight charges in the United States In many respects the most satisfactory presentation of the downward tendency in railway freight charges is afforded by a comparison of average rates per ton per mile charged during successive periods Aside from the manifest advan tage of clearness this method may be preferred because it excludes no portion of the aggregate traffic and presents the  Wholesale Prices and Wages Report of Finance Committee United States Senate Report No x394 Second session Fiftysecond Congress Part I pp 40I 658 337 2I22 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY actual net result of all changes whether advances or reduc tions A disadvantage perhaps not quite so apparent arises from the fact that with the growth of interstate and foreign commerce and the rapid development of our railway system there has been an immense increase of longdistance traffic which naturally carried at lower rates per ton per mile than shorterdistance traffic effects a reduction in the aver age although rates may not be absolutely lower for similar service The error thus caused cannot however be of much importance That such a comparison will show lower charges at the present than at any former time is generally admitted but the extent of the reductions may not be so widely understood The following instances are selected from Mr McCains report The average rate charged by the Pennsylvania Railroad for transporting one ton of freight one mile during 1852 was 542 cents in 1862 it was 204 cents in 1872 146 cents in I882 87 cent in I892 only 65 cent In other words during I892 sixtyfive cents would pay for as much transportation of freight over the Pennsyl vania Railroad as 542 would thirty years earlier Similar reductions have occurred on all other lines In New Eng land the average charge of the New York New Haven  Hartford Railroad has declined from 623 cents in I870 to 176 cents in I892 From Buffalo to Chicago one of the principal routes is that via the Lake Shore  Michigan Southern Railway The average charge of this company during 1854 was 35I cents during 1864 283 cents during 1874 ii8 cents during I884 65 cent and during I892 60 cent The Chicago Milwaukee  Saint Paul Railway operates a greater mileage than any other company in the same territory It received an average of Io6 cents for each ton carried one mile during I892 being a reduction from 128 cents in 1882 249 cents in I872 and 268 cents in 1863 Beginning with an average of 6 I4 cents during 1872 that of the Denver  Rio Grande Railroad had declined to 186  Pp 615617 338REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES cents in I892 while during the same period the Union Pacific Railway had reduced its charges from an average of 234 cents to io8 cents When it is added that an increase of one mill per ton per mile in the average charges for the traffic carried during one year would produce additional revenue equal to ninety per cent of all dividends now paid the importance of these reductions will be appreciated No single rate is of greater constant importance than that upon grain via the allrail lines from Chicago to New York It is not merely the rate at which grain is carried between the greatest grain market in the world and the principal grain exporting port but is also the basis of rates from all western points to all of the cities and towns located on or adjacent to the Atlantic seaboard Any change in this rate therefore effects a corresponding change in the rate upon nearly every bushel of grain produced in the United States and not consumed at or near the point of production The following statement shows the rate charged for the transportation of grain via allrail lines from Chicago to New York on the dates named RATES IN CENTS PER I00 POUNDS YEAR JANUARY 15 APRIL 15 JULY 15 OCTOBER 15 864   75 So 95 I869  75 53 50 50

during the last twenty years For example while the average rate per ton of 2000 pounds from collieries in the Clearfield region of Pennsylvania to Jersey City was 405 during 1873 a ton of 2240 pounds was transported between the same points in 1892 at an average rate of 225 Cotton compressed in  Corn 20 cents 339 2324 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY bales was carried from Memphis to New York during I893 at a constant rate of 50o1 cents per Ioo pounds which was a reduction from 74 cents which prevailed during 1881 Local rates have declined even more than has in many instances been the case with competitive rates For ex ample common starch as late as I874 was charged 38 cents per Ioo pounds from Boston to North Adams Mass via the Boston  Albany Railroad The same transportation is now performed for 15 cents Examples of reductions equal in extent to the foregoing including all sections of the country and every article of commercial importance commonly offered for shipment by rail might be multiplied almost indefinitely but sufficient have been adduced to illustrate the constant tendency toward lower charges which has been such a prominent character istic of the development of railway transportation in the United States Having established the existence of this tendency the question naturally arises whether it is the result of conces sions grudgingly yielded by reluctant carriers who have succeeded in retaining rates sufficiently high to yield extor tionate and unreasonable returns upon the capital invested or has it so fully kept pace with the institution of more provident methods of administration and the economies per mitted by increased density of traffic that the larger propor tion if not the entire aggregate of the benefits derived therefrom has accrued to the shipping and traveling public instead of to the owners of railway stocks and bonds It may be confidently asserted that except in extremely rare instances it is practically impossible to maintain for any considerable period railway rates which are excessive The interests of the railways and their patrons unite in the creation of conditions against which it is vain for any railway official to contend for extremely high rates From the stand point of the railways it is evident that excessive rates See Fourth Annual Report of Interstate Commerce Commission pp 225229 340REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES constitute a limitation upon the quantity of traffic which if carried far enough may became prohibitive The expenses of railway transportation are roughly divided into those arising from operation and fixed charges in the proportion of about sixtynine per cent and thirtyone per cent respec tively The latter are entirely independent of the volume of traffic while a large portion of the former are so far unaffected thereby that a considerable increase in traffic would result in a relatively much smaller increase in the expense of operation It therefore necessarily follows that a large traffic at low rates is often more profitable than a smaller traffic at higher rates a fact which few railway man agers have failed to appreciate Aside from the mere present increase in net revenue possible on account of reductions from high to more equitable rates it is incontestable that low rates tend to develop the territory contiguous to the line over which they are available and consequently to promote the final and permanent prosperity of such lines An en lightened consciousness of these facts has caused the great majority of railway officials having authority to make rates to concede to their patrons the lowest which could be made without increasing operating expenses faster than gross revenue Shippers are constantly appealing for lower rates and the pressure thus brought has been too great for continued suc cessful resistance The manufacturer or producer sees in a concession of a few cents or even a fraction of a cent from current rates an opportunity to put the commodity he ships into more distant markets or to successfully underbid his competitors in those already reached Commercial condi tions and the importunity of rival shippers as well as the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Law which in this respect is believed to be merely declaratory of the common law require that if any concession is made it shall be open to all shippers of the same or similar commodities between the same localities in the same direction Further than this 34I 2526 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the Interstate Commerce Law requires that the carrier mak ing such a concession shall so adjust all its rates that not only intermediate rates upon similar traffic shall not be in excess of those between more distant points but that the entire body of rates shall be relatively reasonable and just Thus along the line of one carrier an initial concession to a single shipper requires a multitude of similar concessions to other shippers and at other points This however is not all Shippers located on other lines and often at an equal or greater distance in other directions from the common market find themselves at a disadvantage on account of the reduc tions already granted and appeals are at once made for reductions by other lines sufficient to restore the original status These must be made or the inevitable penalties of loss of traffic and depleted revenue fall upon the obstinate carrier Railways are also forced in a large measure to com pete for traffic with carriers upon water routes the Great Lakes navigable rivers and canals as well as among them selves the combat in the latter case often assuming Titanic proportions particularly when one or more of the competing railways is by its own bankruptcy relieved from the necessity of earning interest upon its funded debt Thus the action and interaction of forces as far beyond legislative restraint as they are beyond the control of a single carrier unceas ingly operate to reduce the charges for railway transporta tion while the greater economy in operation and manage ment enforced and made possible by lower rates and increased traffic in turn permits further reductions Viewed from the standpoint of the investor in railway properties who may be supposed for the time being merely selfishly interested to secure the largest possible net return upon his capital it can scarcely be said that the present body of railway rates considered as a whole is satisfactory nor has there ever been a period except perhaps during the unrestrained competition incident to a war of rates when it was less so The interest of the investor in railway 342REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES 27 properties in the rates charged is twofold first that they shall produce sufficient revenue above necessary operating expenses to yield an adequate return upon the capital repre sented by the securities he holds and second that they shall permit and encourage the development of the territory contiguous to the railway in order that the future value of its property and franchises may be assured In order to accomplish the latter result it is obviously necessary that rates should be neither unreasonably high nor unjustly dis criminating between persons localities or classes of traffic The following statement arranged from data contained in the report of the Statistician of the Interstate Commerce Commission shows an income account for all the railways in the United States covering the year endng June 30 I893 and also the same data for each group according to the system of territorial

railway rates as well as upon the familiar charge that railway earn ings are grossly excessive and extortionate It shows that sixty per cent of the aggregate revenue is required to pay the cost of operation which includes wages of employes repairs of roadbed and equipment etc three per cent is 345130 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY paid to the various State and municipal governments for taxes eight per cent for rents two per cent for miscellaneous purposes which includes expenses of associations etc making a total of seventythree per cent of the aggregate revenue that is absolutely required for expenses which must precede the right of the bondholder to require payment of interest or of the stockholder to demand dividends The remaining twentyseven per cent is distributed among those who furnish capital or retained by the corporation in the form of permanent improvements or surplus to provide against future contingencies The proportions devoted to each of these purposes is

included in the slightly more than one quarter of the aggregate which accrues in one form or another to the benefit of invested capital and it is therefore only necessary to assert what will not be denied that the items which constitute the first seventythree per cent of the total are legitimate and unavoidable expenses that must be provided for out of the revenues produced by the charges exacted for transportation Neither will it be seriously con tended that the capital invested in railways is entitled to no 346REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES return but all will agree that the schedules of rates should be so arranged as to provide not only for revenue to meet necessary expenses of operation but also a fair return upon the just value of the property Let us now examine the amounts expended for dividends and interest in order to discover if possible whether the investor now receives an inordinate return upon his capital The table on pages 32 and 33 shows the amount of rail way capital of each class in the United States and in each group on June 30 I893 and the payments thereon during the year ending on that date From this table it appears that the average highest and lowest

funded debt are considerably larger than those actually paid for the reason that the Interstate Commerce Commission has seen fit to base its statements upon the amounts of interest accruing during each year instead of upon that actually paid and as there was prob ably a default upon some portion of the interest due in each group the actual amounts paid and the average rates must have been much lower than those shown The table on pages 34 and 35 shows a classification of stock and funded debt exclusive of equipment trust obligations based upon the rate of dividend or interest paid during the

matter how much such cost may have been enhanced by profligate expenditure or corrupt misappropriation of funds nor how much changed conditions may have caused subsequent depreciation of the property It may indeed be true that the public interest will be well served when the circumstances and conditions of railway transportation shall have become so adjusted that the security of money invested in

be purchased from their present owners If value depends as is frequently declared upon cost of duplication it should be remembered that although in certain sections roads have been constructed at extremely low cost in other sections another extreme has been reached Thus in New York City it is said to have cost 4oooooo to construct four miles of line and 2000000 additional to build a station In other localities there are long sections of road where grading alone has cost more than 300000 per mile while bridges like that across the Mississippi River at St Louis costing 4000oooooo per mile and tunnels like the Hoosac at 3oooooo per mile are as essential portions of the railway system as the single track laid on a level prairie through a semiwilderness at a first cost of I5000 per mile There is certainly no reason for believing that much reduction in the cost of works such as those referred to could be made at the present time Another item which would undoubtedly enhance the average cost per mile of duplicating our present railway facilities would be the dis counts necessary upon securities in order to secure capital for construction This is merely a means by which capital is remunerated for the extra hazardous nature of the enter prise and a return sufficiently large to compensate for the risk encountered secured if the alternative of profitable operation is achieved It is for this reason that stock has been frequently given as a bonus to purchasers of bonds and where the practice is limited by the necessities of the case it must be admitted that it is perfectly legitimate In this view the original cost of railways while not conclusive throws considerable light upon their present real value Much has been written in the effort to prove that present capitalization is largely in excess of the amounts actually expended for construction and equipment a result which it is alleged has been attained through fraudulent issues of bonds and stocks paying excessively for construction or for 354REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES acquired properties selling bonds and stocks at a discount and finally by declaring dividends payable in stock all these practices being included in the general denomination  stock watering Different writers have variously estimated the amounts of water in the present capitalization some placing it as high as threefourths of the aggregate while others have urged that the aggregate thus improperly created is entirely offset by that eliminated by foreclosures and reorganizations Instances of substantial reductions in capitalization resulting from these causes are numerous enough to create considerable confidence in the possibility that they may entirely balance the  water The Cincin nati Washington  Baltimore Railroad was reorganized after foreclosure proceedings and became the Baltimore  Ohio Southwestern Railroad on December 20 I889 The stock and funded debt of the new company on June 30 1890 amounted to 35628 I 6 while those of the old company one year before had amounted to 4II45777 The reor ganization of the Vicksburg  Meridian Railroad which became the Alabama  Vicksburg Railway on May i 1889 resulted in a reduction of the total issue of stock and funded debt from 9919713 to 2816525 A reduction from 3795000 to 2 6oooo was also effected by the reorganiza tion on June 24 1891 of the Ohio  Northwestern Railroad now known as the Cincinnati Portsmouth  Virginia Rail road and many similar instances could be cited It may be that reductions like the foregoing are not the inevitable and uniform result of reorganization and foreclosure but that they occur in a large number of instances will not be controverted The number of foreclosures is sufficiently large to indicate the elimination of a vast amount of capital by this cause During a period of eighteen years from the beginning of I876 to the close of I893 55I railway corpora tions operating 57283 miles of road with stocks and bonds amounting to 3209 I26000 were sold under foreclosure This tremendous insolvency with its resultant sales under 355 3940 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the hammer of the auctioneer may easily have resulted in wiping out an amount of stocks and bonds little if any less than that created by stockwatering Railway rates then have steadily declined for a consider able period and they do not produce an exorbitant return upon present capitalization which is an approximately accu rate measure of the just value of the railway system The definite conclusion is therefore reached that the aggregate railway revenue is at the present time just and proper and that under current conditions any schedule of rates covering the entire country and all classes of traffic which would not produce a revenue equal in the aggregate to that now re ceived would be unreasonable and unjust to the owners of railway property But if it is conceded that railway rates as a whole are not excessive it does not necessarily follow that those fair and equitable conditions exist which should result in perfect sat isfaction upon the part of the public It is quite as impor tant from the standpoint of those who purchase transporta tion that the adjustment of rates shall be made without unjust discrimination against persons places or classes of traffic as that the charges shall not be excessive Even a low rate is of no benefit to a manufacturer if some competi tor producing at approximately equal cost can obtain one a few cents lower and thus dispose of goods at a profit at prices which would result in loss to one paying the higher rate A locality seeking to become a manufacturing or distributing centre can make little headway though granted low rates if a competing trade centre is afforded even slight advantage in rates to common markets Unfortunately alike for the railways and their patrons the methods of management aris ing from competitive strife for traffic have throughout the entire period of railway transportation continuously resulted in unjust discriminations of each of these classes and it is because of the manifest injustice of methods which result in the advantage of one locality individual or kind of traffic 356REASONABIE RAILWAY RATES at the expense of another having equal natural opportunities that the public has become so generally dissatisfied with railway rates and has sought by sometimes harsh and unwise legislation to eradicate the grosser and more apparent evils In solving this problem of the relative adjustment of rates between different localities and classes of traffic so that each shall contribute in exact proportion its just share of the sum necessary to carry on the business of transportation lies the true solution of the real railway problem In determining what aggregate revenue is reasonable and just the cost of the transportation service as a whole which includes wages maintenance of facilities and return to capi tal is properly the basis of the calculation but if we seek to make further use of this method and distribute the charges for transportation among the different articles of commerce and the various points of origin and destination according to the cost of each particular service we are at once involved in inextricable confusion Specific rates for particular service can never be determined by the preliminary discovery of the cost of that service because no such distribution of the items of expenditure incident to the business of transportation in fact exists The vast majority of these items are joint ex penses attributable not to any portion of traffic but to all and would continue if the carriage of any particular traffic were entirely discontinued That this is true of fixed charges is generally recognized but that the same principle applies with almost unabated force to operating expenses has almost entirely escaped attention Take for example the simplest division possiblethat between passenger and freight trafficwho can formulate a rule for ascertaining what proportions of the total expenses of maintaining track and roadbed should be charged to each  Nor is this all the best authorities state that from forty to sixty per cent of operating expenses cannot be classified as arising directly from either branch of the service and so apparent is the insurmountable nature of the difficulties attending what is 357 4142 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY unquestionably the simplest distribution possible as well as the danger of serious and material error if an estimate is attempted that the Interstate Commerce Commission has after several years of discussion decided to eliminate this feature from the annual reports required from carriers Should more minute classification be attempted still greater obstacles appear If freight traffic alone is considered it is perceived that it consists of two principal classes through and local each of which admits of extended subdivision but to neither of these classes nor subclasses can be assigned a definite portion of operating expenses Through traffic is carried between important termini in swiftly moving trains which seldom stop except to avoid interference with passen ger traffic while local traffic is carried in slower trains mak ing more frequent stops yet for each of these classes it is necessary that the roadbed shall be in perfect condition bridges in repair switches guarded and signals operated and the entire discontinuance of either traffic would not very considerably diminish the necessary outlay for any of these purposes The same obstacles to success attend every effort to distribute the cost of service down to the last detail when we find a single car loaded with package freight of different kinds carried between different stations all of which must contribute proportionally to the expenses of operation beginning with the cost of handling each particular package and including the wear upon the car itself the wages of trainmen and track hands maintenance of road etc In passenger traffic too if the entire cost of the traffic were de termined what mathematician would undertake the problem of deciding what proportion of expenses arose on account of the lightning express and what from the local accommodation  Transportation in this respect is similar to the industry of mining where silver and lead each in sufficient quantities to be of commercial value are found together Here it is clear that if either silver or lead were to cease to be com mercially valuable the entire expense of mining would have 358REASONABLE RAILWAY RATES to fall upon the other and its price would be correspondingly enhanced Also any diminution in the demand for one or the other commodity resulting in a lower price would in crease the price of the other or if higher prices could not be obtained the business of mining would ultimately be dis continued The prices that must be obtained for silver and lead respectively in order that the business of mining shall afford a reasonable profit are mutually regulative Similarly the revenues which must be obtained from different classes of railway traffic are interdependent and it cannot justly be predicated of rates upon any one class or commodity or between any particular points that they are excessive or un reasonable without reference to rates upon other articles and between other points This would be perfectly evident were it not for the multitude of items which constitute the total traffic of an ordinary railway If a railway be conceived operating between two points only and carrying only one commodity at rates absolutely fair and reasonable and it is supposed that a second commodity is offered for transporta tion it is evident that unless the extra cost incident to the new traffic bears the same relation to the revenue derived from it that the former cost of operation bore to the former revenue there must be either a reduction in rates upon the former commodity or a considerable increase in the profits of transportation and as the former return to capital was reasonable and a higher one would be excessive the public would have a clear right to demand lower charges So also the discontinuance of either traffic would involve a resultant right to higher charges for the transportation of that which remained Railways are entitled to a certain easily ascertained amount of revenue which should be produced by charges for transportation distributed among the different localities and classes of traffic with absolute fairness and impartiality according to principles akin to those which should regu late the exercise of the taxing power Each individual 359 4344 ANNAILS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY commodity and locality should be treated with equality and should not be subjected to any disadvantage or prejudice except those naturally arising from location or character of traffic Reasonable and proper discriminations based upon the value of the service performed are essential and should continue but unjust discriminations founded upon favoritism and prejudice should disappear Charges between all points and upon all articles should be fixed at the point where observing the reasonable limitation of total revenue each particular rate will produce the greatest possible revenue above the absolute expense of handling Constant endeavor to create new traffic should be made and none should be refused which can afford to pay rates producing the smallest revenue above the cost of handling with a reasonable allow ance for the estimated depreciation of permanent way and equipment directly attributable to that traffic Such a rule would make the carriers revenue the sole criterion of its charges subject to the single limitation that rates must be open to all It would be speedily discovered that traffic is divided into two classes according to whether its volume is limited by the rate charged Upon many articles it would be found that lower rates produce increasing revenue and upon such articles reductions to the point of highest net revenue would at once follow Upon other articles not thus affected in their movement by the rates charged a final re duction would ensue consequent upon the greater contribu tion of articles of the former class to the items of joint expense The ultimate result of the enlightened and consistent exe cution by a large number of important railways or better still by a consolidated railway exclusively operating in a large territory of a policy similar to that outlined would certainly be rates much lower than the legislative maximums now regarded as amounting to the practical confiscation of railway properties Washington D C H T NEWCOMB 360

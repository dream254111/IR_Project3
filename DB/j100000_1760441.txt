their pro ductions and to keep such books as will indicate the destination of their products such products can be followed to the dealers and through the dealers to the customers At the same time by the use of a system of exchanging stamps similar to that now in operation as to distilled spirits the article may be readily identified by the consumer without necessitating the imposition of a second tax THE SKILL DISPLAYED by Mr Edward Burgess in the application of scientific principles to the construction of yachts has again received a mark of appreciation from the Naturalists club of Boston to which he belongs and which last year gave him a dinner to commemorate the victory of the Puritan Last Friday at a dinner given in his honor at which some fifty members were pres ent the club presented him with a pair of silver saltcellars modelled after  natures most graceful designs one of them a miniature Nautilus in scribed  Puritan the other an Argonautshell of similar size marked Mayflower  and both excel lent copies of the originals while the spoons have handles of twisted rope and on the back of the bowls delicately raised pictures of the fa mous yachts No pains were spared in the work manship WOMEN ON THE NEW YORK SCHOOL BOARD As was foreshadowed in a recent number of Science viii No 197 the movement in favor of the appointment of women to the board of educa tion in New York City has been successful On Wednesday of last week Mayor Grace filed his appointments and the list was found to be made up of three new men two of the old commission ers who were reappointed and two women In taking this step the mayor has put himself in line with advanced thought on this subject and has we feel certain contributed in no small degree to the increased efficiency of the publicschool system For years women have sat on the school boards of London Edinburgh and other foreign cities and many of our own towns and school districts choose one or more women among their managers When we consider the character of education in general the peculiar conditions of public instruc tion the fact that a large proportion not in frequently a majority  of publicschool students VOL VIII No 199 are girls and that fully ninetenths of the public school teachers are women the reasons for the presence of women on the boards of education are apparent Then too it is highly probable that the presence of women commissioners will raise the deliberations of a board of education to a higher plane and lift them out of the political entanglements in which they are too often caught All these considerations apply with peculiar force to New York City and moreover these com missioners of education enjoy a position of great influence and honor The board of education has general supervision of the whole school system It appoints the principals of schools but not the teachers these are appointed by the trustees of the various wards who in turn are chosen by the board of education for a term of four years All the money and supplies for the schools are voted by the board and all repairs and new build ings and the purchase of sites are directed by it In making these particular appointments Mayor Grace has avoided what would have been a great mistake He has not appointed any  cranks or any professional agitators for  womans rights At such a time plenty of these persons come for ward as candidates but their appointment would have been turning the whole movement into ridi cule Both of the women chosen by the mayor are of the highest standing morally intellectu ally and socially They are neither agitators nor theorists but women of pure Christian character great ability and what is quite as essential to a commissioner of education some common sense They are both deeply interested in education and close students of its theory and practice Distin guished for years in connection with the promi nent charities and philanthropic institutions of a great city we have every reason to predict that the character and talents which they bring to their new and somewhat trying office will elevate and improve its publicschool system THE CHARLESTON EARTHQUAKE WE are indebted to the Philosophical society of Washington for permission to use the accompany ing map in advance of its regular publication in their Proceedings It was presented by Mr Hay den to illustrate his paper on the Charleston earth quake read before the society on Oct 23 and represents graphically the data which had reached the U S geological survey concerning the dis tribution of the earthwave from the great shock of Aug 31 as to area intensity isoseismals and time coseismals It was compiled mostly from information sent in by private correspond ents and it will be interesting to compare it withNOVEMBER 26 1886J SCIEENGCE 471 results obtained later when much additional data relative intensities as plotted with any facts will be at hand from the signal service lighthouse which have come to their

seismology must be largely based The outer isoseismal where the shock was felt472 SCIENCE by only a few persons encloses a land area of 774000 square miles and adding only half as much more for the ocean and gulf makes the dis turbed area very nearly as large as that given by Reclus for the great Lisbon earthquake of 1755 Indeed the state department has reported one reliable observation showing that it reached Ber muda The irregularities of the isoseismals are of course due to the varying geologic and topo graphic structure of the country and will well repay a more careful study than we have space for here The rapid loss of energy in the sands and alluvial deposits of the northeast coast and lower Mississippi valley is especially noticeable The isolated areas of different intensities too are typical of cases which would be very numerous were it possible to plot intensities in great detail instead of only indicating the general features of their distribution The coseismals were determined by many very reliable and consistent but noninstrumental ob servations the most accurate being from points in that part of the disturbed area north of a line from Jacksonville Fla to St Louis For the most part high velocities of wavetransmission are indicated Where the lines are somewhat crowded it must be owing at least in part to the earlier tremors having failed to reach so far so that a later phase of the wave was successively felt and recorded The general use of standard time has added greatly to the reliability of these observations and on the whole we may perhaps be justified in feeling a certain sense of selfsatis faction in view of Mallets remark that  the ac curate measurement of time is one of the surest indications of advancing civilization At the present age of this young and interesting science probably the most valuable results will be obtained from observations made at numerous points in a selected district with some simple instruments which will accurately record the time number and duration of every shock that occurs TECHNICAL AND MANUAL TRAINING CLASSES OF THE SOCIETY OF DECORA TIVE ART IN the autumn of 1885 the Society of decorative art of New York desiring to extend its educa tional advantages opened an artschool where men and women boys and girls might be trained in the principles of art and in the rudimentary steps of various artindustries The first season was one of much usefulness and encouragement and the second opens with promise The school is centrally located in West 22d Street Nos 37 and 39 An important feature of the school in VOL VIII No 199 addition to classes in drawing painting modelling from life from stilllife and from the antique is a special department in manual training as applied to practical designing modelling in clay wood carving and metalworking In considering the plan of instruction of this new school the fact must be borne in mind that the work of the Society of decorative art has from its inception been distinctively educational The object of the society was to develop artin dustry in America to extend among women the knowledge of artneedlework and its adaptation to household decoration to provide instruction to lend books to give helpful criticism for the guidance of those at a distance and in addition to furnish a salesroom where artistic work might be brought to the notice of purchasers In the brief period of its life less than ten years  the society has faithfully striven to ac complish these purposes A standard of color design workmanship and adaptation has been created through its influence an influence which is felt in every home throughout the country and may be recognized in the wares of the humblest shop where decorative materials are sold Needle work was almost a lost art so entirely had the sewingmachine triumphed it has already taken a place among artindustries Hundreds of women have been trained by the society and have gone forth to earn a living and provide homes for them selves and those dependent upon them The demand of the age is for workers  men or women  who can do The artisan who has command of head and hand alike is the one who is sure of success Human machines can have no chance in competition with those who are intelli gent in their work Headcraft and handcraft combined give to the worker a solid stone on which to stand The societys department for technical and manual training provides just this education Classes have been formed where boys and girls are taught to think and do to use brain eye and hand together that they may become intelligent and disciplined workers The school is fortunate in having secured the services of Mr J Liberty Tadd as director who brings to his work an enthusiasm and confidence born of success The keynote of his teaching is that everybody has capacity in some direction Training will develop the peculiar aptitude The earlier in life this work of training begins the better for the pupil The child restless and im patient is eager to try its hand and welcomes a suggestion to make something This desire is gratified and directed interest is held ambition stirred and thought developed The result is calm quiet growth an appreciation of labor a

of Physic,i206916,275 XXVIII Thoughts on the different Impregna tion of Mineral Waters more particularly concerning the Existence of Sulphur in some of them by John Rutty Doctor of Physic INASMUCH as the existence of sulphur in waters hath been doubted not only by Lister and Hoffman but by another author that has lately appeared to whom the public has been in some measure indebted for exploding sulphur from some waters on which it had been too liberally and without the due evidence of experiment attri buted I have therefore thought it worth while to review collect and sum up the evidences of sulphur in waters in order to shew not only that antiquity hath not altogether rashly attributed sulphur to wa ters but how far the existence of that mineral is de monstrable to sense in several and more especially the cold waters of that denomination Read Nov 15 1759 1 That the fetor of these waters is not owing to mere stagnation and that they possess something more than what common water acquires by putrefac tion appears not only from Dr Shorts observation of some of these having a full and brisk current but because putrid rainwater and many of our chalybeat waters turned putrid by keeping do not discolour metals as these waters do 2 The effects of these waters and their vapours in discolouring metals and their peculiar smell and flavour like that of boiled eggs and in the stronger like that of rotten eggs are perfectly similar to those N n 2 of276 of the artificial solution of sulphur and its va pours 3 Many of these waters both foreign and domes tic are found to contain the native alcaline salt which is the proper menstruum for and has the same effect in dissolving sulphur as the artificial alcali viz not only the hot waters of Aix la Chapelle and Borsel but the cold of Geronsterre and in England those of Chadlington Nottington Bilton Quincamel Sutton bog and Wigglesworth and the following in Ire land viz those of Swadlingbar Derrylester Lis blenk Ashwood Derryherce Anaduff Aghaloo and one lately discovered at Lucan near Dublin 4 Accordingly a milkiness or incipient precipita tion analogous to lac sulphuris is produced in seve ral of these waters by dropping acids into them par ticularly in those of Aix la Chapelle even according to Dr Lucass own testimony of the effects of distilled vinegar on it and in that of Moffat in Scotland of Harrigate in our Swadlingbar water and another of our springs of this sort in the C Fermanagh and to this add the white hairy mucus ordinarily precipi tated on the sticks or grass in the passage of these waters analogous to a magistery of sulphur 5 The sulphur in waters is in a most highly atte nuated subtile and fugitive state insomuch that as Dr Lucas observes of those of Aix la Chapelle there is a great alteration in the colour of the precipitate caused by solution of silver in that which hath been immediately drawn from the source and that which has lain by only twenty seconds even in a bottle filled and close stopt so soon is it lost or dissrpated and moreover it is also blended with other minerals so277 so that it is no wonder it should be difficult to exhibit a palpable sulphur and that the distinguishing appear ances proper to that mineral should often fail parti cularly the abovementioned test by acids and the burning blue 6 That a real sulphur or bituminososulphureous substance is dissolved in these waters and subsists in some of their less volatile or more fixed parts is evi dent from the following appearances in the mud and scum collected from several of them for the mud of several of the cold waters I have called sulphureous as well as that of several hot baths in Germany and Hungary mentioned by Browne in his Travels is variegated with the several colours of yellow green and red as the real sulphur and in some experi ments burnt with a blue flame and a sulphure ous smell and the like evidences may be given of the sulphureous quality of the scum of divers of our cold waters particularly in that of Mechan in the north of Ireland which being dried exhibited on the upper side a whitish yellow or creamcolour but underneath a deep grassgreen a pale beautiful goldcolour and a light reddish pinkcolour inter spersed in a substance of a leaden blackish colour every colour excellent in its kind and as slippery as frogs spawn varieties of colours like these being also found in the preparation of lac sulphuris vari ously exposed to the air But to come to more direct proofs we are assured in Shorts first volume of his History of mineral waters as to the cold waters of Harrigate that both the mud and scum burnt with a blue flame and smelt strong of sulphur and that great quantities of yellow sublimed flowers of sulphur have278 have been found under the basons of that well And Dr Peter Shaw affirms that real brimstone even found to be so by proper trials hath been seen float ing in the water like feathers and separable by bare straining and to all this agrees the observation I have frequently made on several of these cold waters viz certain light purplecoloured pellicles are frequently found floating in them which being dried sparkle flame and stink on the redhot iron But to con clude the operation and effects of several of these our cold waters altogether similar to those of sul phur abundantly confirm their impregnation with that mineral Thus it appears that sulphur is not confined to the hot baths of Aix la Chapelle and a few more abroad but is found also in the cold waters of both England and Ireland and as these have of late years been subjected to a minute examination I shall subjoin a brief comparison between the one and the other from experiment and observation thus 1 Is the smell of the waters of Aix la Chapelle like that of the washings of a foul gun or like that of the solution of sulphur in an alcaline lye So is that of our cold waters called sulphureous 2 Do Aix la Chapelle waters taken from their source turn silver of a goldcolour and blackish and with its solution and that of sugar of lead exhibit a darkcoloured precipitation So do our waters called sulphureous 3 Does Aix la Chapelle water on dropping di stilled vinegar into it exhibit a milkiness analogous to lac sulphuris So divers of the cold waters above mentioned do also exhibit a white cloud with other acids 4 Do279 4 Do the waters of Aix la Chapelle and Borsel contain an alcaline salt So do many of our cold waters above enumerated 5 Is silver borne in the pockets during a course of Aix la Chapelle waters tarnished The like ef fect hath been observed in several of our cold wa ters 6 Do the waters of Aix la Chapelle yield flowers of sulphur and do some of the springs of Borsel pre cipitate a magistery of sulphur The like hath been observed in some of our cold waters above enume rated 7 Are the baths of Aix la Chapelle of known efficacy in the cure of the itch impetigo vitiligo and ulcers So are the cold waters above enumerated as appears from the signal successes which have attended their use even in some of the most inveterate and rebellious disorders of this kind Is there any rashness then in concluding that these our cold waters do also contain sulphur substantially dissolved in them and differ from the hot ones of Aix la Chapelle and Borsel in nothing but heat and the different proportions of impregnating minerals of the same quality Hence appears the great usefulness of examining mineral waters in concert for as various accidental circumstances give occasion to different appearances the examination of a competent number and variety of them helps to supply the defects in the histories of some of them And if this were further prose cuted I doubt not but sulphur in substance might be obtained from several of them as well as from Aix which is therefore recommended to physicians and naturalists So280 So much may suffice concerning such waters wherein sulphur is the predominating ingredient but there are others wherein there are strong indications of its presence in a smaller proportion and mixed with other minerals and indeed perhaps few waters are without an admixture of it for beside several plain waters especially such as contain the native alcali and the purging waters seawater the brine springs and the chalybeate waters all which mani fest a fetor by putrefaction and some of them there upon the like discolourations of metals as the sulphu reous waters the chalybeate waters in particular manifest a sulphureous admixture by the cream which they throw up to the surface the various co lours whereof and its discolouring metals are marks of sulphur There are moreover several other waters even some of those which otherwise make the nearest ap proach to pure element having very little salts or earth which I have mentioned in the beginning of this work which also give strong suspicions of some degree of a sulphureous impregnation by the purple and black sediments precipitated from them by so lution of silver which are eminently confirmed by a late examination of the celebrated Holy wells at Malvern published in the 50th volume of the Trans actions and there extolled for many cures which altho they do not yield quite a grain of solid contents from a pint upon evaporation give three evidences of sulphur 1 The purple powder precipitated from them by solution of silver 2 In exhaling the water slowly in a silver vessel the bottom of the vessel was tinged 8 of281 of a pale yellow colour as if it had been gilded 3 When exhaled almost to a dryness it emitted vapours of the smell of burning brimstone And lastly besides all these I have frequently re marked of several other waters here and there men tioned in this work that their sediments obtained by evaporation did manifest some pittance of this mine ral by the fetor they acquired on being rubbed with salt of Tartar which in the language of our author abovementioned being attracted by the acid the phlogiston is let loose I have above recommended the farther investiga tion of sulphur as a desideratum in the history of mi neral waters and shall now beg leave to conclude this paper with the mention of two or three more articles which greatly want further elucidation The first is alum which although hitherto found but in extremely few waters and chiefly in those of Nevil Holt Ballycastle acid water and perhaps in the Hartfell water in Scotland abovementioned accord ing to some late experiments yet the genuine crys tals of alum have not as yet been satisfactorily de monstrated in any of these The second is the volatile mineral alcali which the nitre of the ancients contained and some of our mineral waters here and there give strong suspicions of by the experiments with a mixture of quicklime and of the solution of mercury sublimate corrosive but this matter greatly merits farther inquiry and several difficulties attending it remain necessary to be explained Thirdly the hint lately given in the 49th Vol Part II of the Transactions of the efficacy of the VOL LI O o Ca282 Carolsbadt water as superior to limewater in dis solving stones out of the body if confirmed by cor respondent events in the internal use would be a dis covery of the greatest moment and highly deserves to be prosecuted I shall only observe here that the principal mine rals impregnating it are a native alcaline salt and a calcarious earth and that the Aix la Chapelle waters are not without such a salt and earth also and which is of more moment they are reported by long tak ing to render the urine alcaline even as do the Ca rolsbadt waters and we are also told that calculi macerated twentyfour hours in the water of Aix la Chapelle have been reduced to a sand or soft con sistence but how far this last the Selters the Bourne waters or our Tilbury water or others alike impreg nated may participate of a like virtue must be de termined by further observation and experience Dublin the 24th 3d mo 1759

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074187,NEW PUBLICATIONS,I244528,EDITORIAL NOTES OF FORCING SCHOOLS TO UNIVERSITY STANDARDS BUT THIS FORCING IS NECESSARILY ARTIFICIAL AND TEMPORARY IF IT RUNS COUNTER TO THE INEVITABLE TENDENCIES WHICH ONE WHO KNOWS RECOG NIZES IN THE AMERICAN SCHOOL SYSTEM THIS SYSTEM IS MORE IMPREGNABLE THAN THE UNI VERSITIES FOR IT IS MORE EXTENSIVE AND BETTER ADAPTED TO THE PECULIAR CONDITIONS OF AMERICAN CIVILIZATION IT IS ONLY A QUESTION OF TIME WHEN EVERY UNIVERSITY WILL RECOG NIZE THE FACT THAT IT MUST ADAPT ITSELF TO THE POSSIBILITIES OF THE SCHOOLS AND THAT ANCIENT OR ARTIFICIAL STANDARDS CAN BE MAINTAINED ONLY SO LONG AS THEY APPROVE THEM SELVES TO THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SCHOOLMASTER THE MOUNTAIN WILL NEVER COME TO MAHOMET TO COMPEL SCHOOLS TO DIFFERENTIATE EARLY A SMALL AND SELECT AND EXPENSIVE CLASS FOR ENTRANCE TO THE UNIVERSITIES IS UNFAIR BOTH TO SCHOOL AND TO THE UNIVERSITY AND SERIOUSLY CHECKS THE DIFFUSION OF HIGHER EDUCATION TO DENY THE PRIVILEGE OF BREATH ING THE UNIVERSITY ATMOSPHERE TO ANY PRODUCT OF A GOOD SECONDARY SCHOOL INVOLVES SUCH A NARROW CONCEPTION OF EDUCATION THAT ONE DISLIKES TO ASSOCIATE IT WITH THE UNIVER SITY IT HAS ALWAYS SEEMED AN ANOMALY THAT UNIVERSITIES ARE INCLINED TO RATE THEM SELVES MORE UPON THE BASIS OF THEIR RAW MATERIAL THAN THEIR FINISHED PRODUCT A FINE MESHED SCREEN IS SET UP AT THE BEGINNING OF THE UNIVERSITY CAREER WHEN IT WOULD SEEM FAR MORE LOGICAL TO SET IT UP AT THE OTHER END THIS MATTER OF ENTRANCE HAS MUCH TO DO WITH THE OPPORTUNITY GIVEN TO SCIENCE TO EXPRESS ITSELF IN EDUCATION IF ITS MOST PROM ISING AND BEST TRAINED MATERIAL IS TURNED BACK OR HANDICAPPED WHEN ATTEMPTING TO ENTER THE UNIVERSITY A CERTAIN KIND OF EDUCATIONAL THEORY MAY COMMAND THE RESULT BUT IT IS A BLOCKADE AGAINST THE GENERAL PROGRESS OF EDUCATION IN SO FAR AS IT CUTS OFF A GREAT AGENCY FROM OPERATING UPON THE LEGITIMATE MATERIAL NEW PUBLICATIONS QUAINT NUGGETS SELECTIONS FROM FULLER HALL SELDEN HERBERT AND

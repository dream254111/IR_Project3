which class of torts a different rule14 is universally admitted as prevailing Though the dissent from the doctrine here maintained is not as great as it would at first appear there are quite a number of very able courts which take the view that tortfeasors not acting in coln cert or by unity of design are not liable jointly and severally for damages although the consequences of the several torts have iunited to produce an injury to the plaintiff15 But this view is lecidedlv in the minority and the one first advanced seems much the better on both reason and authority16 NEGLIGENCE or PARENT IMPUTED TO INFANTSThe doctrine im puting to an infant the negligence of the parents originated in Eng land The principle was first recognized in this country in a New York case where an infant of tender years was denied recovery for injuries by reason of the negligence of its parents in allowing it to be in danger2 It cannot have any application to infants old enough to be guilty of contributory negligence3 Other cases arise where the parent is present and actively negligent No distinction exists which warrants the application of different rules to the two classes of cases Of the first class was the case first es tablishing the rule in this country It is submitted that the reasoning in the case was unsound and it has since been much criticized4 It denies to the infant the protection of the law The parent is in truth the guardian of the infant when the latter is not sui juris but it can not be justly said that the acts of the parent are the acts of the infant and thus allow in effect a waiver by the parent of a tort upon the infant In Vermont the doctrine was first directly repudiated There a rule was adopted which has received sanction in a majority of the 13

case under a statute giving right of action for death by wrongful act an infant of tender years was killed while in the custody of its father The fathers active negligence contributed to the death The father brought suit as administrator for the estate of the child Recovery was denied the fathers contributory neg ligence being imputed to the child and operating as a bar to the action for the benefit of the next of kin Ohnesorge v Chicago City Ry Co Ill 102 N E 819 In the application of the principle in actions under these statutes the authorities differ widely The American acts fail to mention the effect of contributory negligence of the beneficiaries7 The various cases arising under the forms of action permitted by the statutes have been dealt with by judicial leg islation the result being a state of confusion and conflict among the authorities almost impossible to reconcile When the infant is not killed and brings suit for injuries it is set tled that the contributory negligence of the parent is not a bar8 When the action is by the parent in his own right for the death or injury of the child most courts deny any recovery if the parents negligence contributed9 In these cases it seems unnecessary to in voke the doctrine of imputed negligence10 The ruling may be sus tained on the broad ground that no one should be allowed to profit by his own wrong When the action is by the personal representative under the stat ute for the benefit of the estate different rules prevail The author ities are unsettled especially upon cases in which a negligent parent sues as administrator under the statute The administrator is not himself a beneficiary and even though the parents are also not men tioned as such the former is in fact but a nominal party12 and has only the rights of those entitled to the estate for which he sued Therefore the same rule could be applied as to the action by the beneficiary directly Such is the construction in some states13 6Robinson v

In a few jurisdictions a recovery is allowed for the beneficiaries free from negligence and is denied to those who are negligent14 This is the logical solution without taking unwarranted liberties with the statutes which are practically similar The result is that when the parent brings the action as administrator he will be denied any recovery because of his contributory negligence if he is the sole ben eficiaryl5 Also when the administrator sues for the benefit of the estate which goes to several beneficiaries if any of the latter have been contributorily negligent the recovery will be reduced in pro portion to their shares16 Thus the one is prevented from profiting by his own wrong and the other beneficiaries receive their compen sation as intended by the legislature CONTROL BY MANDAMUS OVER JURISDICTIONAL MISTAKE OF LAW Where appellate jurisdiction of a cause arising from a justices or other inferior court is lodged in an intermediate court and such court erroneously declines to take jurisdiction or erroneously dis misses an appeal duly taken the overwhelming weight of modern authority holds that such a mistake of law on the question of juris diction is not final and that the intermediate court may be compelled by mandamus to proceed with the trial of the case whenever there is no other adequate remedy by appeal or writ of error The court has no right to dismiss the case and thus deny the appellant his day in Court it is within the power of the court so to dismiss the appeal but such a mistake of law or matter of practice purely preliminary to the real points at issue will be corrected by mandamus from the highest court Nor is this a violation of the principle that mandamus does not lie to correct or set aside an exercise of the ju dicial discretion The duty to assume jurisdiction is purely minis terial and where there is no other remedy mandamus lies not to direct the decision of the court on matters going to the merits but 14 Horton

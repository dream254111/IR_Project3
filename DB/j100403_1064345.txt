respect Va Code 1919  5134 No case on this point seems to have arisen MARRIAGEINDIANSVALIDITY OF MARRIAGE OF INDIAN WHO HAS GIVEN UP TRIBAL RELATIONS GOVERNED BY LAW OF STATE IN WHICH HE RESIDES The deceased an Indian while still affiliated with his tribe married A in accordance with tribal customs Several years later he applied to the Land Board for an allotment of homestead under a federal statute requiring as a condition precedent to such allotment satisfactory proof of abandonment of tribal relationships The allotment was granted Shortly afterwards A following tribal laws and customs divorced the deceased and married another man Thereupon the decedent entered into a tribal marriage with B with whom he cohabited until his death Upon the decedents death both A and B claimed to share in his estate as his widow Held A was entitled to the widows share In re Wogin ups Estate Utah 192 Pac 267 It is the uniform holding of the courts that so long as Indians main tain their tribal relations the courts will recognize the tribal customs prevailing and administered by such tribes especially respecting their domestic relations James v Adams 56 Okla 450 155 Pac 1121 WVali v Williamson 8 Ala 48 Kobogum v Jackson Iron Co 76 Mich 498 48 N W 602 In every such case the courts in upholding a marriage or di vorce contrary to the laws of the land made the same dependent upon the fact that at the time of such marriage or divorce the parties re tained their tribal relatins Moore v Wamego 72 Kan 169 83 Pac 400 Oklahoma Land Co v Thomas 34 Okla 681 127 Pac 8 Boyer v Dively 58 Mo 510 But where an Indian has abandoned his tribal re lations he ceases to be subject to the laws and customs of his tribe and becomes subject to the laws of the State or Territory in which he resides Moore v Wamego supra In re Nowgezhuck 69 Kan 410 76 Pac 877 Matter of Heff 197 U S 488 The case last cited upholds the power of Congress to change the status of the Indian from that of ward to that of citizen by appropriate legislation Act of Congress March 3 1875 c 131  15 Comp Stat  4611 providing for allotments of land to Indians makes satisfactory proof before the Land Board of abandonment of tribal relations a condition precedent to such allotment The decision of the Land Department as to the existence of facts necessary for or the performance of con ditions precedent to a lawful exercise of their authoirty is conclusive and cannot be collaterally impeached in an action at law Smelting Co v Kemp 104 U S 636 Vance v Burbank 101 U S 514 Bagnell v Brod erick 13 Pet 436 It seems to follow that the allotment of lands to an Indian under this act is conclusive proof that the Indian has severed his tribal relations and so it was held in the instant case MARRIAGEUNCLE AND NIECE OF THE HALF BLOODNOT INCESTUOUSIn an action for divorce brought by the wife it was alleged by the defend ant that the marriage was void being in violation of a statute whichRECENT DECISIONS declared that a marriage between a brother and sister of the whole or half blood or between an uncle and niece was incestuous and void and that since the plaintiff was a daughter of a half brother of the defendant there could have been no valid marriage Held that the parties were validly married and a divorce could be granted Audley v Audley 184 N Y Supp 38 At common law incest was not indictable but it was punished in the ecclesiastical courts as against good morals But in most if not all juris dictions in this country it has been made a crime with appropriate punishment 4 BL COM 65 State v Keesler 78 N C 469 State v Smith 30 La Ann 846 and see note in 111 Am St Rep 19 Since the offense is statutory its exact nature varies in the several states but there is sufficient similarity between the statutes for decisions in one jurisdic tion to be cited as authority in another A long line of authorities have universally interpreted statutes worded similarly if not identically to the one involved in the instant case with a diametrically opposite result In fact no decision has been found supporting the instant case but all hold that such a mar riage between an uncle and niece of the half blood is incestuous and void Williams v McKeene 193 Ill App 615 State v Guiton 51 La Ann 155 24 So 784 State v Wyman 59 Vt 527 8 Atl 900 59 Am Rep 753 The language employed in the statute is to be interpreted according to its common meaning and when the terms uncle and niece are viewed in that light they will include the daughter of a brother of the half blood State v Reedy 44 Kan 190 24 Pac 66 The rule is laid down in some jurisdictions that the relationship of uncle and niece must be of necessity by the half blood and that the fact that the parent of the woman is only a half brother or sister of the husband cannot give validity to the marriage State v Hairris 149 N C 513 62 S E 1090 128 Am St Rep 669 Other authorities justify the doctrine on the grounds that all degrees of kindred are computed according to the rules of the civil law by which those of the half blood are admitted in all respects equally with the whole blood State v Wyman supra The New York court based this decision upon an interpretation of their statute which provided that a marriage is incestuous and void if contracted between a brother and sister of either the whole or the half blood between an uncle and niece or aunt and nephew They stated that if the intention of the legislature was to bar marriages between uncle and niece of the half blood then such a provision would have been in corporated into that clause of the statute forbidding marriages between uncle and niece The only New York case which search disclosed upon the general subject decided that a marriage between an uncle and niece before the passage of a prohibitory statute was not void Weisberg v Weisberg 98 N Y Supp 260 The question seems not to have been before the courts of Virginia SALESCONSTRUCTION O CONTRACTAppoxIMATA QUANTITIESThe

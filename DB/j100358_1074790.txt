YORK BY NICHOLAS MURRAY BUTLER HARPERS WEEKLY MAY 13 1896 THE POLITICIAN AND THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BY SUPERINTENDENT L H JONES ATLANTIC MONTHLY JUNE 1896 MR JONES USES AS THE BASIS OF HIS PAPER INFORMATION RECEIVED FROM OVER I600 TEACHERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS IN ALL PARTS OF THE NATION THIS ARTICLE IS A STRIKING PRESENTATION OF THE EVILS DUE TO POLITICAL INFLUENCES IN PUBLIC SCHOOL MATTERS HE CITES THE SCHOOLS OF INDIANAPOLIS AND CLEVELAND AS EXAMPLES OF THE BENEFITS OF FREEDOM FROM THESE INFLUENCES MR JONES WRITES WITH GREAT EARNESTNESS AND SPEAKING AS HE DOES FROM A LONG AND VARIED EXPERIENCE IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF THIS COUNTRY HIS JUDGMENT SHOULD HAVE GREAT WEIGHT WITH ALL THINKING PEOPLE THE STUDY OF CHILD NATURE IN THE CHURCH BY MARY CHISHOLM FOSTER CHAUTAUQUAN MAY I896 SOMEONE MAY POINT TO THE LONG LIST OF ENROLLED SUNDAYSCHOOL SCHOLARS IN THIS COUNTRY AND SAY THAT MUCH IS BEING DONE NO THE VERY NEXT TO NOTHING IS BEING DONE AND CIVIL AUTHORITIES ARE FAR IN ADVANCE OF THE CHURCH IN THE 479THE SCHOOL REVIEW SCIENTIFIC AND PRACTICAL CARE AND CULTURE OF YOUNG CHILDREN THIS FACT IS BECOMING APPARENT TO SOME EARNEST PRIMARY TEACHERS IN THE CHURCH AND THEY ARE INQUIRING FOR METHODS IT IS NOT MORE METHOD THAT IS NEEDED BUT MORE INTELLIGENT CONSECRATION TO THIS SERIOUS WORK TOGETHER WITH A KNOWLEDGE OF HOW TO USE THE BEST APPLIANCES FOR A DEVELOPMENT OF THE THREEFOLD NATURE OF THE CHILD TEACHERS MUST STUDY THE CHILD MORE CLOSELY AND COME INTO MORE INTIMATE SOULGENIAL CONTACT WITH HIM NATURAL SCIENCE IN A LITERARY EDUCATION BY PROFESSOR A H TOLMAN POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY MAY I896 THE MATHEMATICS AND THE MORE EXACT PHYSICAL SCIENCES HELP AS NO OTHER BRANCHES OF STUDY CAN TO GIVE TO THE MIND HABITS OF ACCURACY AND A SENSE OF PROPORTION IN A CLASS IN LITERATURE MANY QUESTIONS DO NOT ADMIT OF EXACT ANSWERS THE PERSONAL ELEMENT MUST COME IN THE ANSWERS OF THE MOST CARE FUL INSTRUCTOR ARE ONLY AN APPROXIMATION TO THE TRUTH THE ANSWERS OF THE MOST SUPERFICIAL SCHOLAR WILL NOT BE ENTIRELY WRONG INDEED SINCE A LITERARY MASTER PIECE MAKES ITS APPEAL PRIMARILY TO THE EMOTIONS AND THE IMAGINATION THE WHOLE CONCEPTION OF DEFINITE EXACT ANSWERS TO SPECIFIC QUESTIONS HAS BUT A LIMITED APPLICATION TO THE WORK OF THE CLASS IN LITERATURE IN MATHEMATICS AND THE MORE EXACT PHYSICAL SCIENCES EACH PROBLEM IS SPECIFIC AND HAS ONE ANSWER THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT ALL OTHER POSSIBLE ANSWERS ARE EXACTLY AND ENTIRELY WRONG EVERY MAN NEEDS THE DISCIPLINE OF SUCH STUDY A LAST WORD ON THE OLYMPIAN GAMES BY CHARLES WALDSTEIN HARPERS WEEKLY MAY 20 I896 THE OLYMPIAN GAMES WERE A THOROUGH SUCCESS AS AN ATHLETIC PERFORMANCE AS AN INSPIRING SPECTACLE AND AS AN INTERNATIONAL SOCIAL EVENT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THIS TRIUMPH HAS BEEN ACHIEVED OWING CHIEFLY TO THE EFFORTS MADE BY THE ROYAL FAMILY OF GREECE TO THE GRACIOUSNESS AND CORDIALITY OF THEIR MANNERS AND TO THE HOSPITABLE GENEROSITY SHOWN BY THE WHOLE POPULACE TO THEIR FOREIGN GUESTS AND COMPETITORS THE WHOLE ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF SO COMPLEX AN UNDERTAKING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CARRIED OUT IN A MORE PERFECT MANNER AND IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THIS WAS CHIEFLY IN THE HANDS OF THE CROWN PRINCE HE DID NOT LOOK UPON HIMSELF AS A MERE FIGUREHEAD BUT TOOK THE WHOLE WORK INTO HIS OWN HANDS ATTENDING ALL THE MEETINGS GOING TO THE OFFICE EVERY DAY AND CON CERNING HIMSELF WITH EVERY DETAIL IN RE THAT INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC LANGUAGE EDITORIAL UNIVERSITY MEDICAL MAGAZINE FEBRUARY 1896 AS IT SEEMS TO US THE INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE MUST BE DEVELOPED IN OUR SCHOOLS IF NEARLY EVERY EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION OF THE WORLD TEACHES LATIN WHY NOT TEACH IT PROPERLY AND APPLY THE KNOWLEDGE TO SOME PRACTICAL USE THE UTTER FAILURE OF THE AVERAGE PERSON TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE KNOWLEDGE 480CURRENT EDUCA TIONAL LITERA TURE GAINED BY THE LARGE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT UPON LATIN AND GREEK IN THE SCHOOL IS LAMENTABLE OUR INSTITUTIONS SHOULD INSIST ON COLLOQUIAL TEACHING TEACHERS SPEAKING LATIN FLUENTLY SHOULD BE EMPLOYED TO TEACH LATIN COLLOQUIALLY AND NATIVE GREEKS SHOULD BE OBTAINED TO TEACH GREEK COLLOQUIALLY IF THOSE INTERESTED IN SECURING AN INTERNATIONAL LANGUAGE IN REALITY WILL USE THEIR INFLUENCE IN ESTABLISHING THE COLLOQUIAL METHOD OF TEACHING LATIN AND GREEK IN THE SCHOOLS OF THE WORLD EITHER LANGUAGE BOTH WRITTEN AND SPOKEN MAY BE USED UNIVERSALLY BY THE NEXT GENERATION THE REALIZATION OF AN INTER NATIONAL LANGUAGE LIKE OTHER ADVANCES WILL COME BY EDUCATION NOT BY FORCE THE OLYMPIC GAMES AT ATHENS BY CHARLES WALDSTEIN HARPERS WEEKLY APRIL I5 I896 THE ORIGINAL AIM OF THE GAMES OF PRODUCING COMPLETE AND NORMAL HEALTH AMONG THE GREEK MEN AND YOUTHS WAS ENDANGERED BY THE GROWTH OF THE PROFESSIONAL SPIRIT AND THE MEANS WERE CONVERTED INTO THE END THE WHOLE LIFE WAS SUBORDINATED TO THE PURSUIT OF AN ATHLETIC PRACTICE LF WE MERELY FOLLOW UP THE ANCIENT ILLUSTRATIONS OF GREEK ATHLETES IN ANCIENT STATUES VASES ETC WE CAN TRACE THIS PROCESS OF PROFESSIONAL DEGENERATION IN THE FOURTH AND FIFTH CENTURIES BC THE ATHLETE IS A MAN PRESENTING THE FINEST PROPORTIONS OF THE HUMAN FIGURE THE FURTHER WE LEAVE THIS HIGHEST PERIOD OF HELLENIC CIVILIZA TION AND OF THEIR AMATEUR SPORTS AND APPROACH THE DISSOLUTION OF THEIR COM MONWEALTH AND THE INCREASE OF PROFESSIONAL AND PAID ATHLETES THE MORE DO WE FIND BULKY AND FORMLESS TYPES IN WHOM THE MERE MUSCULAR DEVELOPMENT SEEMS TO ABSORB ALL THE VITALITY OF THE WHOLE ORGANISM THE HISTORY OF ONE OF THE CONTESTS ALONE BOXING ILLUSTRATES THE PROCESS OF DEGENERATION IN THE BEST PERIOD MEILICHESTHAT IS SOFTENERS CORRESPONDING TO OUR GLOVES WERE INTRODUCED  THEN FOLLOWS ONE STAGE FURTHER IN SEVERITY THE IMAS OXUS THE LEATHER THONG WOUND AROUND THE HAND AND FINALLY IN THE ROMAN PERIOD THE OVERFED BULKY PAID ATHLETE FOUGHT WITH THE CESTUS STUDDED WITH LEADEN BALLS WHICH BRUTALLY LACERATED AND OFTEN KILLED A CONTESTANT IT IS WELL TO LEARN FROM THIS HISTORY AND TO ADOPT ONLY THE CUSTOMS OF THE HIGHEST PERIOD THE NEW GEOGRAPHY BY ALBERT P BRIGHAM POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY APRIL 1896 IT MAY AS WELL BE FRANKLY ADMITTED THAT GEOGRAPHY AND GEOLOGY OVERLAP ALL SCIENCES TRANSGRESS EACH OTHERS BOUNDARIES AND ALL BOUNDS IN NATURE ARE LARGELY MATTERS OF CONVENIENCE GEOLOGY NEVER TRULY INTERPRETED TERRES TRIAL HISTORY UNTIL WITH HUTTON AND LYELL IT TOOK TO STUDYING GEOGRAPHY NOR WILL THE GEOGRAPHER UNDERSTAND THE EARTH WHICH HE SEES UNTIL HE TAKES ACCOUNT OF GEOLOGY LAND FORMS CAN NOT BE TRULY SEEN OR FAITHFULLY DESCRIBED UNTIL SEEN AND DESCRIBED IN THE LIGHT OF THEIR ORIGIN SUCH FORMS WILL HIDE THEM SELVES FROM THE STUDENT WHO THINKS THEY ARE DEAD FOR HIM THEY MIGHT NEARLY 48ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW AS WELL BE BURIED THE GEOLOGIST WHO SEEKS FOR EXAMPLE THE CAUSES OF VOL CANISM WILL FIND HELP IN HIS STUDY OF THE DISTRIBUTION AND RELATIVE ACTION OF EXISTING VOLCANOESIN OTHER WORDS HE CANNOT KEEP FROM GEOGRAPHY THE GEOGRAPHER IN HIS TURN NEEDS THE PERSPECTIVE OF ANCIENT VOCANIC HISTORY IF HE WOULD APPRECIATE HIS OWN FACTS BECAUSE HE HAS COMMONLY HAD NO SUCH VISTA HE HAS BURDENED GENEIATIONS OF BOYS WITH THE SOLEMN BLUNDER THAT A VOLCANO IS A BURNING MOUNTAIN THUS WE MAY VINDICATE FOR EACH SCIENCE ITS OWN CENTER WHILE GRANTING A GENEROUS MEASURE OF COMMON FACTS THE DIFFER ENCE IS IN THE POINT OF VIEW THE AIM AND METHOD OF TREATMENT THE GEOLOGIST SEEKS LARGELY THAT WHICH HAS BEEN THE GEOGRAPHER THAT WHICH IS AND EACH MUST BE KNOWN IN THE LIGHT OF THE OTHER IT IS PRECISELY THE CASE WITH TWO BIOLOGISTS ONE OF WHOM STUDIES LIVING THE OTHER FOSSIL FORMS THE DAY IS PAST WHEN THEY CAN WORK APART YET NONE WOULD DENY THAT THEIR FIELDS ARE REASONABLY DIFFERENTIATED FOREIGN NOTES CONDUCTED BY F H HOWARD THE NEW EDUCATIONAL BILL THE SCHOOLMASTER LONDON APRIL 4 I896 WE HAVE NO HESITATION IN DESCRIBING THE EDUCATION SCHEME OF THE GOVERN MENT AS EASILY THE MOST DRASTIC AND FARREACHING SERIES OF PROPOSALS FOR THE RECONSTRUCTION OF OUR EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM EVER YET SUBMITTED TO THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT CONJECTURE AS TO ITS ULTIMATE EFFECTS IS OF COURSE MORE OR LESS PROFITLESS IF INTERESTING BUT LOOKING FAR INTO THE YEARS WE SEE UNDER THE SCHEME THE ENTIRE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE EDUCATIONAL AUTHORITY ELECTED AD HOC WE SEE THE DISAPPEARANCE OF THE SCHOOL BOARD AS SUCH WE SEE THE SIMPLI FICATION AND UNIFICATION OF LOCAL ADMINISTRATION WE SEE LHE PARISH COUNCIL ACTING AS THE LOCAL MANAGERS OF A SCHOOL IN LIEU OF THE PRESENT DIRECT AND AUTONOMOUS CONTROL OF THE TOO OFTEN PETTIFOGGING SCHOOL BOARD WE SEE THE LEAVENING OF THE PRIVATE MANAGEMENT OF VOLUNTARY SCHOOLS WITH A MEASURE OF SUPERVISION AT THE HANDS OF THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITY AND WE SEE ALL FORMS OF LOCAL EDUCATION UNDER THE GENERAL DIRECTORSHIP OF A STRONG COUNTY OR COUNTY BOROUGH AUTHORITY NOW THESE THINGS MAY BE IN THE DIM AND DISTANT FUTURE ONLY AND THEY MAY OR MAY NOT QUITE WORK OUT ON THESE LINES BUT IF WE VENTURE AT THIS EARLY STAGE UPON A COMMENT AT ALL IT WOULD BE TO ASK THE TEACHERS OF THE COUNTRY TO TAKE THE WIDER VIEW OF THE PRESENT SITUATION AND TO LOOK AT THE SCHEME IN THE FIRST PLACE IN THE LIGHT OF THESE ULTIMATE POSSIBILITIES THEY SUGGEST MUCH WE VENTURE TO THINK THAT MAY BE UTILIZED IN THE LONG RUN FOR THE BETTERMENT OF ALL FORMS OF EDUCATIONPRIMARY BECAUSE OF ITS ASSOCIATION WITH SECONDARY RURAL BECAUSE OF ITS MORE EFFECTIVE CONTROL VOLUN TARY BECAUSE OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ELEMENT OF REPRESENTATIVE SUPERVISOR SHIP 482

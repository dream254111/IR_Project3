A LETTER OF DR JOHN WALLIS GEOM PROF OXON AND F R S TO MR THOMAS BEVERLY CONCERN ING HIS METHOD FOR INSTRUCTING PER SONS DEAF AND DUMB S I R I HAVE RECIEVED YOUR LETTER OF SEPT 22 WHERIN YOU TELL ME THE CASE OF A FAMILY WHEREIN YOU ARE CONCERNED WHICH IS REALLY VERY SAD OF EIGHT CHILDREN NOW LIVING FIVE ARE DEAF AND DUMB AND I SUPPOSE DUMB BECAUSE DEAF YOU DESIRE MY DIRECTIONS HOW BEST TO SUPPLY THAT DEFECT HAVING HAD SOME ACQUAINTANCE I UNDERSTAND WITH MR ALEXANDER POPHAM WHO I THINK IS YET LIVING WHOM BEING BORN DEAF I TAUGHT ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE AND THIRTY YEARS AGO TO SPEAK DISTINCTLY THOUGH I DOUBT HE MAY NOW HAVE FORGOT MUCH OF IT AND TO UNDERSTAND A LAN GUAGE SO AS TO EXPRESS HIS MIND TOLERABLY WELL BY WRITING AND TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IS WRITTEN TO HIM BY OTHERS AS I HAD BEFORE TAUGHT MR DANIEL WHALEY WHO WAS DEAF ALSO BUT IS LATELY DEAD OTHERS WHO WERE NOT DEAF BUT HAD GREAT IMPEDIMENTS IN THEIR SPEECH WHO STUTTERED EXTREMELY OR WHO HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO PRO NOUNCE SOME LETTERS I HAVE TAUGHT TO SPEAK VERY DISTINCTLY AND TO PRONOUNCE THOSE LETTERS WHICH BEFORE THEY COULD NOT SO AS PERFECTLY TO CON GGG QUER354 QUER THAT DIFFICULTY AT LEAST SO AS THAT IT WAS VERY LITTLE IF AT ALL DIS CERNABLE SOME OTHER DEAF PERSONS I HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED TEACHING THEM TO SPEAK BUT ONELY SO AS IN GOOD MEASURE TO UNDERSTAND A LANGUAGE AND TO EXPRESS THEIR MIND TOLERABLY WELL IN WRITING WHO HAVE THEREBY ATTAINED A MUCH GREATER MEASURE OF KNOWLEDGE IN MANY THINGS THAN WAS THOUGHT ATTAINABLE TO PERSONS IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND BE COME CAPABLE UPON FURTHER IMPROVEMENT OF SUCH FURTHER KNOWLEDGE AS IS ATTAINABLE BY READING THE FORMER PART OF THIS WORK TEACHING TO SPEAK OR TO SPEAK PLAIN IS TO BE DONE BY DIRECTING THEM TO APPLY THEIR TONGUE LIPS AND OTHER ORGANS OF SPEECH TO SUCH POSTURES AND MOTIONS AS ARE PROPER FOR THE FORMATION OF SUCH AND SUCH SOUNDS RESPECTIVELY AS ARE USED IN SPEECH AND THEN THE BREATH EMITTED FROM THE LUNGS WILL FORM THOSE SOUNDS WHETHER THE PERSON SPEAKING DO HEAR HIMSELF OR NOT OF WHICH RESPECTIVE FORMATION OF ALL SOUNDS COMMONLY USED IN SPEECH I HAVE GIVEN A FULL ACCOUNT AND I THINK I AM THE FIRST WHO HAVE DONE IT IN MY TREATISE DE LOQUELA PREFIXED TO MY GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH TONGUE FIRST PUBLISHED IN THE YEAR 1653 IN PURSUANCE OF WHICH I ATTEMPTED THE TEACHING OF DEAF PERSONS TO SPEAK AND THIS IS INDEED THE  WORK OF THE TWO HOWEVER LOOKED UPON AS THE MORE STUPENDOUS BUT THIS WITHOUT THE OTHER WOULD BE OF LITTLE USE FOR TO PRONOUNCE WORDS ONLY AS A PARROT WITHOUT KNOWING WHAT THEY SIGNIFY WOULD DO US BUT LITTLE SERVICE AND IT WOULD BY DEGREES WITHOUT A DIRECTOR TO CORRECT MISTAKES COME TO BE LOST IN PART FOR LIKE AS ONE WHO WRITES A FAIR HAND IF HE BECOME BLIND WOULD SOON FORGET THE EXACT DRAUGHT OF HIS LETTERS FOR WANT OF AN EYE TO DIRECT HIS HAND SO HE WHO DOTH NOT HEAR HIMSELF SPEAK MUST NEEDS BE APT TO FORGET THE NICENESS OF FORMATION WITHOUT A PROMPTER FOR WANT OF AN EAR TO REGULATE HIS TONGUE THE OTHER PART OF THE WORK TO TEACH A LANGUAGE IS WHAT YOU NOW  ABOUT IN ORDER TO THIS IT IS NECESSARY IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE DEAF PERSON BE TAUGHT TO WRITE THAT THERE MAY BE SOMEWHAT TO EXPRESS TO THE EYE WHAT THE SOUND OF LETTERS REPRESENTS TO THE EAR TWILL NEXT BE VERY CONVENIENT BECAUSE PEN AND INK IS NOT ALWAIES AT HAND THAT HE BE TAUGHT HOW TO DESIGN EACH LETTER BY SOME CER TAIN PLACE POSITION OR MOTION OF A FINGER HAND OR OTHER PART OF THE BODY WHICH MAY SERVE INSTEAD OF WRITING AS FOR INSTANCE THE FIVE VOWELS A E I O U BY POINTING TO THE TOP OF THE FIVE FINGERS AND THE OTHER LETTERS B C D C BY SUCH OTHER PLACE OR POSTURE OF A FINGER OR OTHERWISE AS SHALL BE AGREED UPON AFTER THIS A LANGUAGE IS TO BE TAUGHT THIS DEAF PERSON BY LIKE ME THODS AS CHILDREN ARE AT FIRST TAUGHT A LANGUAGE THOUGH THE THING PERHAPS BE NOT HEEDED ONELY WITH THIS DIFFERENCE CHILDREN LEARN SOUNDS BY THE EAR BUT THE DEAF PERSON IS TO LEARN MARKS OF THOSE SOUNDS BY THE EYE BUT BOTH THE ONE AND THE OTHER DO EQUALLY SIGNIFY THE355 THE SAME THINGS OR NOTIONS AND ARE EQUALLY SIGNIFICANTIA AD PLACITUM OF MEER ARBITRARY SIGNIFICATION TIS THEN MOST NATURAL AS CHILDREN LEARN THE NAMES OF THINGS TO FURNISH HIM BY DEGREES WITH A NOMENCLATOR CONTAINING A COMPETENT NUMBER OF NAMES OF THINGS COMMON AND OBVIOUS TO THE EYE THAT YOU MAY SHEW THE THING ANSWERING TO SUCH A NAME AND THESE DI GESTED UNDER CONVENIENT

AND WELL RECRUITED FROM TIME TO TIME AS NEW WORDS OCCUR WILL SERVE HIM IN THE NATURE OF A DICTIONARY AND GRAMMAR AND IN CASE THE DEAF PERSON BE OTHERWISE OF A GOOD NATURAL CA PACITY AND THE TEACHER OF GOOD SAGACITY BY THIS METHOD PRO CEEDING GRADUALLY STEP BY STEP YOU MAY WITH DILIGENCE AND DUE APPLICATION OF TEACHER AND LEARNER IN A YEARS TIME OR THEREABOUTS PERCEIVE A GREATER PROGRESS THAN YOU WOULD EXPECT AND A GOOD FOUN DATION LAYD FOR FURTHER INSTRUCTION IN MATTERS OF RELIGION AND OTHER KNOWLEDGE WHICH MAY BE TAUGHT BY BOOKS IT WILL BE CONVENIENT ALL ALONG TO HAVE PEN INK AND PAPER READY AT HAND TO WRITE DOWN IN WORDS WHAT YOU SIGNIFY TO HIM BY SIGNES AND CAUSE HIM TO WRITE OR SHEW HIM HOW TO WRITE WHAT HE SIGNIFIES BY SIGNES WHICH WAY OF SIGNIFYING THEIR MIND BY SIGNES DEAF PERSONS

PUT INTO WRITING AND PARTICULARLY EX PLAINED WILL TEACH HIM BY DEGREES TO UNDERSTAND  SENTENCES AND LIKE ADVANTAGES A SAGACIOUS TEACHER MAY TAKE AS OCCASION OFFERS IT SELF FROM TIME TO TIME THUS I HAVE IN A LONG LETTER GIVEN YOU A SHORT ACCOUNT OF MY ME THODS USED IN SUCH CASES WITH GOOD SUCCESS WHICH TO DO AT LARGE WOULD REQUIRE A BOOK I HAVE TAKEN THE PAINS TO DRAWUP THIS METHOD WHICH IS WHAT I HAVE PURSUED MY SELF IN THE LIKE CASE AS APPREHENDING IT MAY BE OF USE TO SOME OTHERS WHEN I AM DEAD AND I AM NOT DESIROUS IT SHOULD DY WITH ME AND I HAVE DONE IT AS PLAINLY AS I COULD THAT IT MAY BE THE BET TER UNDERSTOOD I HAVE GIVEN ONELY SOME SHORT SPECIMENS OF SUCH TABLES AS I HAD MADE FOR MY OWN USE AND THE USE OF THOSE WHOM I WAS TO INSTRUCT BUT TO GIVE THEM AT LARGE WOULD BE MORE THAN THE WORK OF A LET TER AND THEY ARE TO BE VARIED AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PERSONS AND360 AND THE PLACES MAY REQUIRE OR THE PRUDENCE OF A TEACHER SHALL FIND EXPEDIENT IT IS ADJUSTED TO THE ENGLISH TONGUE BECAUSE SUCH WERE THE PERSONS I HAD TO DEAL WITH TO THOSE OF ANOTHER LANGUAGE IT MUST BE SO ALTERED AS SUCH LANGUAGE REQUIRES AND PERHAPS WILL NOT BE SO EASILY DONE FOR ANOTHER LANGUAGE AS FOR THE ENGLISH THE FLEXION OF NOUNS THE CONJUGATION OF VERBS THE DIFFERENCE OF GENDERS THE VARIETY OF SYNTAX C DOTH IN OTHER LAN GUAGES GIVE A GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WHICH THE SIMPLICITY OF OUR LANGUAGE DOTH FREE US FROM BUT THIS IS NOT MY PRESENT BUSINESS I AM OXFORD SEPT 30 1698 SIR YOURS TO SERVE YOU J O H N W A L L I S

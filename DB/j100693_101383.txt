j100693,Philosophical Transactions 16651678,101383,Two Other Letters Consonant to the Former One of the Lord VisCount Brouncker the Other of the Said Sir Ch Wren,i206873,Two other Letters to the same purpose with the former The first of the Right Honourable the Lord Viscount Brouncker Chancellor to her Majesty and President of the R Society c SIR IT is very sure that MrWilliam Neil had in the year 1657 found out and demonstrated a Streight line equal to a Paraboloeid and did then communicate and publish the same though not in print to my self and others who used to meet at Gresham Colledge and it was there received with good approbation and the same was presently afterwards otherwise demonstrated by my self and others And therefore ancienter than that of Monsieur Heurat which as it seems is not pretended to have been done before the year 1659 and ancienter too than that of SrChWren finding a Streight line equal to a Cycleil in the year 1658 and by him admitted so to be Nor ought it at all to prejudice Mr Neil that M Heuraets was somewhat sooner abroad in print than that of MNeil though both in the same year 1659 since it is well known to many of us that Mr Neils was done before Otherwise M Hugens by the same reason will grant the precedency to Heuraet of that which he now claims to be his own invention that Rectifying the Parabolical Line and Squaring the Hyperbolical Space do mutually depend on each other for this was published in print by MHeuraet or MSchooten for him in the year 1659 and not by M Hugens till now 1673 And yet M Hugens thinks he may well claim that invention to be his own because he now tells us that he found it out about the end of the year 1657 and did some time after com municate it privately to some friends And whereas he doth suppose that this invention of his might give occasion to that other of Heuraet we may also as well suppose that he might have taken such occasion from hearing of Mr Neil having done the like for this had been then commonly known for a great while Or might have taken occasion as well as MrNeil from that of DrWallis Schol prop38 Arith Infin or from that of SrChWren having found a Streight equal to another Curve the year before Or if it were necessary to know their symbo lization between the Parabolical Line and the Hyperbolical Space he might have had it earlier from DrWallis For when he had demon strated Schol prop 38 Ar Infin that the Particles which compose the X x x x x x 2 Para6150 Parabolical line are in power equal to a Series of Squares increased by a series of Equals suppose A2  b2 And prop3541ConicSect that c the Ordinates to the Conjugate Diameter of an Hyperbola that is the particles of which that Hyperbolical space consisteth are so also viz 14T2TLh2 where ATL are permanent quantities and b h taken successively in Progression Arithmetical It was easie for MHeuraet or MHugens or any other to infer That if we can Rectifie the one we may Square the other  vice versa But from whence soever MHeuraet had it we may as before reasonably con clude that Mr Neil had it before him And M Hugens is a person of that ingenuity that when he shall better consider of it he willI doubt not be of the same mind LondonOct81673 The other Letter is of SrChristopher Wren Kt Surveyor General of his Ma jesties Buildings c SIR THat I did in the year 1658 find a Streight line equal to that of a Cycloid and the parts thereof was then very well known not in England only but in France and Holland And I have not yet heard of any who do pretend to have known it before I discoverd it which was the same year acknowledged in Print by those of France But I do not pretend to have been the first that did ever find a Streight line equal to a Crooked For I very well know that Mr William Neil had the year before found out and demonstrated How to construct a Crooked line so as to be equal to a Streight by a certain series of Numbers after the method of DrWallis And though He did not there in demonstrate the other properties of that Line yet the same were presently after demonstrated by my self and others and the nature of the Line fully discoverd being a certain Paraboloeid And that which M Heurat is said afterwards to have found out in the year 1659 and MFermat in the year 1660 are but the same with that of Mr Neile An Accompt

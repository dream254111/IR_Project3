explained That the sea when this part of the coas tal plain rose above it left numerous in equalities somewhat similar to the ripple made pittings seen in the sand in the bot tom of a gutter after a rain has suggested itself to me If so these basinlike pittings separated from each other by sand ridges highest above the general shore slope on their east sidemight have formed the ba sins for these bays Fuller observation and study is needed before anything but a tentative conclusion may be reached Any additional observa tions or suggestions will be gladly wel comed L C GLENN DARLINGTON S C A NEW METHOD OF DETERMINING THE MO TION OF STARS IN THE LINE OF SIGHT A METHOD of measuring the motions of stars in the line of light which does not require the use of an artificial comparison spectrum and which is therefore adapted to slitless spectroscopes has been proposed by Professor Orbinsky of Odessa A N 3289 It is of unusual interest because the objectglass spectroscope which is so advantageous with respect to simplicity of construction and to the brightness of the spectra which it yields has never yet been successfully applied to this branch of as tronomical research The principles on which the method de pends may be briefly described as follows If a luminous body is moving in the line of sight the distance between any two lines in its spectrum is not what it would be if the body were at rest since the two lines are unequally displaced by the mo tion In a normal spectrum the dis placement of the lower line would be somewhat the greater although the differ 475 ence would scarcely be measureable under ordinary circumstances but on account of the increasing dispersion of a prism toward the violet the effect in a prismatic spectrum is reversed and the upper line is displaced more than the lower one The differential displacement of the HI and H9 lines in an ordinary prismatic spectroscope is in fact somewhat more than half the absolute dis placement of the Htr line By measuring this apparent change of dispersion the mo tion of a star can be determined To avoid the errors attending the meas urement of large distances on a photograph and other errors which need not be spe cially mentioned here the spectrum of a star whose motion in the line of sight is known is photographed on the same plate and the apparent change of dispersion due to the motion of the first star is deduced from measures referred to corresponding lines in the spectrum of the second The stars selected for purposes of comparison would naturally be bright stars with well defined lines and their motions could therefore be accurately determined by the usual methods Only a comparatively small number of such standard stars would be required For slit spectroscopes it would probably be found that Professor Orbinskys method is inferior to the usual one although Pro fessor Vogel finds that it can be applied to some of the photographs taken with the Potsdam spectograph It not only depends upon a differential effect and thus reduces the amount of the available displacement but it requires the measurement of lines which are widely separated and therefore badly defined in consequence of their great distance from the axis of the camera objec tive Even if this lens were constructed with a view to giving a large field the defi nition would be inferior to that in the

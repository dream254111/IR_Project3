Saxony The first group of experimental pedagogical investigations deals with the formlal side of school instruction Ought instruc tion to be given in fullhour lessons or in sholrter ones That is to say should there be an intermission between the recitations In what order are the easier and more difficult studies to be dis tributed over the school day and which studies are after all to be called difficult How much time should be used in daily instruction and is it advisable to extend the work into the free time of the pupil by giving him oral and written tasks for home work  These questions came up at the moment when people learned to look upon the mental activity of the pupil as an expenditure of energy of psychophysical force The latter thought is a new and important idea by means of which modern pedagogy enlarges in a humane way its didactic principles of instruction As is well known the pupil was in former years considered a mere receptacle for all kinds of knowledge Modern instruc tion on the contrary tries to develop in the most intensive way the selfactivity of the pupil The manifold processes of the pupils perception apperception and judgment must support and penetrate each other The teachers question must not only draw upon the memory but it must arouse and set these mental processes free In this sense one teaches today in a way which develops and in this consists the art of the teacher Let us turn now to the pupil It is impossible for him to arouse this logical activity out of nothing Every mind which is mentally active is at work It expends psychical energy 1 The first article in this series appeared in the School Review January 1907 535536 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Psychical energy when concentrated becomes attention Every logical activity presupposes that its object is grasped by means of attention Let us take an example Mental activity with its living organization of perception presentation and thought is like the machinery olf a mill in which many wheels work ingeniously into each other This machinery has to be driven by a brook To be put in motion and to continue in motion it needs only the force olf the water If the activities perception presentation and thought are to work into each other they need also a source of power The brook which drives this mental machinery is the psychical energy of attention Our example shows how important the pedagogical treat ment of attention is This is the psychical reservoir of energy by which the pupil does all his mental work This capital should neither be neglected nor wasted by the teacher It should be used in such a way that instruction may produce the greatest effect while expending as little as possible of that energy Therefore to the demand that instruction shall arouse this mental activity is added the demand for economy With this idea of an instruction which elicits and strengthens mental activity thought out with insight of genius by the great pedagogues of the past century our century combines the ideas of social hygiene and humanity Since stimulating instruction expends the mental strength of the pupil most intensively it must be economical Economical of what of the psychical energy olf the pupil which the teacher arouses in the form of attention Why economical Nowhere in the world can work be done without expending something In our case the nervous force of the pupil is used up To be more exact the nerves are overloaded with wornout particles toxins poisonous materials causing fatigue are created which prevent further activity of the nerves Consequently it becomes a hygienic duty of the teacher to handle the capital of psychical energy as economically as possible I have compared the psychical energy to the force of a brook As the level of every brook changes with the season so the degree of psychical energy is different at different hours The firstEXPERIMENTAL PEDAGOGY IN GERMANY 537 thing which the psychological teacher must know is when that source of strength flows more fully and when more sparingly It is a fact that the quantity of it which the pupil controls and which in given cases he must put into the concentrated form of attention is subject to daily and yearly changes And the teacher must neglect neither the daily nor the yearly fluctuations of psychical energy In order to be able to know the amount of psychical energy at every moment one must be able to measure it at every moment Measuring is the most important business of the experimental psychologist Measure and number make him master of the world of consciousness as measure and number made the physicist master of the material world Now one can never measure without a unit of measurement therefore it is most important to acquire some method of expressing numerically the different psychical activities Upon this task the most ardent efforts the best art of the experimental psychologist is directed Often it has happened that a method of measurement offered itself seductively which on close examination proved insufficient so that the experimentor was forced to renewed consideration and new trials The history of psychological methods of measuring is the history of human patience but also of scientific victories W Stem Privatdozent in Breslau has suggested a very convenient and useful method for measuring the momentary states of physical energy and W A Lay Seminarlehrer in Karlsruhe has employed the method extensively They per ceived that every person seemed to have his own psychical tempo Whoever listens to a lecture sees gymnastic exercises or does them himself plays the piano with somebody else sings or debates notices soon whether the tempo of the impressions is agreeable to him or not Everyone left to himself chooses in speaking walking singing writing etc a tempo which is natural to him In the same manner one person counts adds multiplies reads more quickly the other one more slowly That is to say thinking has with different persons a definite tempo In the laboratory of Professor Kraepelin at Heidelberg this538 THE SCHOOL REVIEW tempo has been studied in such different occupations as count ing writing and adding In doing so it was found that the tempo remained independent of the special kind of activity He who adds slowly counts and writes slowly He who adds quickly keeps this quick tempo in writing and counting Thus it seems to be an expression of the present actual amount of storedup energy2 This conclusion is strengthened if we learn that the psychical tempo changes quite naturally in the course of a day In such a change the changing state of psychic energy shows itself and thereby a very simple method of measuring psychical energy is indicated It is only necessary to count how often the child beats rhythmically threefour time at the rate best suited to him in order to measure by the number of those beats the actual state of psychical energy The more beats in a minute the shorter consequently the duration of the measure the more strongly psychical energy flows in the person The fewer beats the longer the measure the lower the level of psychic energy In short beat ing time measures energy as the thermometer measures tempera ture The abovementioned method of examining is excellent because it measures psychical energy without expending it because it is short because it can take place without preparation at any moment If it is employed at different times of the day the tempo in which an individual beats threefour rhythm from hour to hour will be an exact reflection of the course of his mental energy We can read it from the curve in which the hours of the day are the abscissas and the durations of the measures are the ordinates In the main this curve keeps the same shape always no matter what the mental or physical occupation happens to be which the experiment of timebeating interrupts It is always the same characteristic Mcurve3 no matter whether we deal with school or vacation days According to Lays school experi ments the different subjects of instruction or the intermissions 2 W A Lay Experimentale Didaktik 8 W Stern Psychologie der individueller DifferenzenEXPERIMENTAL PEDAGOGY IN GERMANY 539 between the recitations likewise cannot retard the wavelike motion These influences work more or less upon the rising or falling of the curve of energy but not upon its shape Imme diately after awakening psychic life flows rather slowly and reaches only quite gradually during the hours of the forenoon 1012 the maximum display of energy Toward noon the curve sinks and reaches one or two hours after dinner its minimum of the day which however does not stand so low as the morning or evening minimum The later afternoon 57 brings a second maximum and the evening a third minimum The way in which energy varies should set us to thinking At present we try in the German schools more and more to put all scientific subjects into the forenoon 7I oclock in sum mer 81 oclock in winter while the afternoon remains as free as possible or is only reserved for technical subjects drawing gymnastics singing Here it is presupposed that the customary regular afternoon instruction from 24 oclock is of very little use to the pupils because they are still under the effects of digestion and not ready for special mental efforts It is indeed true that the teaching from 24 oclock in the afternoon is not worth a great deal But if we examine W A Lays statistical tables we find that psychical energy about 9io or 121 oclock in the forenoon does not stand any higher4 Moreover W A Lays tested persons were under specially favorable conditions for the time from 121230 The people investigated by Lay were pedagogical students of the Karls ruher Internat from seventeen to nineteen years of age who had to rise at 5 oclock and were being taught from 812 in the forenoon dinner at 1230 and from 25 in the afternoon They were therefore free from 12 to 1230 and had been under instruc tion only four hours The pupils of schools in which the principle of forenoon instruction is carried out have had by this time already five hours of teaching and they are still being taught at that time Their mental energy between 12 and I might stand still lower than that of Lays people between 2 and 4 It is therefore all the more difficult to understand why the au In Germany people dine at I oclock540 THE SCHOOL REVIEW thorities do not put the later schoolhours into the afternoon from 4 to 6 or 5 to 7hours worth so much more because then psy chical energy reaches its second maximuminstead of working the brains of the already tired pupils from 12 to I oclock But when people planned the continued forenoon teaching they had no thought of measuring psychical energy They considered more the fact that the closing of school at 12 oclock and begin ning at 2 oclock was a hardship to the pupils of larger cities Here time spent in going to school is from 20 to 40 minutes They must go back and forth during the recess from 12 to 2 oclock and besides find time to eat dinner But must this hard ship be replaced by a new one which by piling up schoolhours causes the pupils to be victims again Psychical energy not only shows hourly and daily fluctua tions but peculiar to it are many other smaller and larger oscilla tions The smallest ones are those wellknown rhythmical risings and fallings of attention which occupy only seconds It is impossible for anyone to be always attentive in the same degree At one moment intense at the next moment it yields a little to concentrate again4 immediately afterward If the question of the teacher strikes the pupil at the moment in which his attention is so to speak not fixed the prolmpt answer will easily fail You are asleep says the teacher perhaps and turns to another pupil I wonder if the first pupil would not have known the right answer the next minute Moire striking are the yearly fluctuations of psychical energy They follow the course of a W W A Lay found that the psychical energy of his pupils declines fromr March to July then grows up to September thence to decline again In March the molting season of animals it reaches its highest in July and October its lowest state What according to this is there to be said about the plan of the South German schools that put the decisive promotional examinations as well as the Abiturientenex amen into Julythe time of the lowest state of psychical energy and what as to collegeentrance examinations in June in AmericaEDITOR On July 21 1905 a pupil of Obersekunda from Stuttgart who had to pass his promotional examinations toEXPERIMENTAL PEDAGOGY IN GERMANY 541 Unterprima wrote to me In the afternoon we had to do the hardest work At 24o Reaumur we had to translate an exceed ingly difficult piece of Greek We were all sitting in our shirt sleeves had red faces and between the rustling of the paper we heard the suppressed breathing of hard thinking In the uni versities too is the hint of nature neglected There professors hold their lectures and the students listen to them all during July At the end one feels according to the significant expression semesterkrank The North German schools dispose much more rationally of the time of the lowest state of psychic energy Here students have vacations in July and October This example should be followed by all other educational institutions We know now when the source of psychical energy flows By means of this we do all mental work Let us see now how it works that is to say how that state of intense attention works into which teaching that develops mental activity puts the pupil In this state the pupil thinks logically The working energy spends nervous force The more nervous force used without giving the brain time to replace the poisonous wastematerial the more weariness shows itself The toxin spreads out over the nervous system and the consequence is that it becomes more and more useless in all its functions From this study of the indications of fatigue it follows that not only the sensory but also the motor as well as the vaso motor effects of the nerves are being diminished The decaying products are carried by the blood into all the nervetracts Numerous experiments have confirmed this conclusion Gries bach has shown that intellectual activity diminishes the sensation of difference in the senses Mosso has proved that under the same conditions the power of the musclesthat is to say the functional activity of the motornervesis diminished likewise Meumann found that after one of his pupils had worked at addi tion for two or three hours the pressure of the blood was so greatly reduced that one could almost speak of heart weakness The justnamed statement contradicts a widespread view How frequently are people working with their minds told by people doing manual labor that their activity is not real work542 THE SCHOOL REVIEW because it does not fatigue the body And on the other hand there are still teachers who like to put between a few hours of hard mental labor gymnastics singing drawing as recreation lessons with the idea that during such mainly motor occupa tions the mental freshness of the pupils will be renewed This is entirely wrong Since our nervous system is one complete whole real fatigue will be felt at the same time in all fields of our activity Bodily fatigue diminishes just as much mental force as mental work influences the strength of the muscles and the vasomotor functions Fatigue through mental or bodily work shows itself not a little in the resulting work Quality is poor quantity dimin ishes the time for recognition and association is prolonged memory is weakened capacity for exercise sinks thoughts are turned in undesired directions desire for work is turned into dislike These mental effects must above all interest the psy chological instructor What is the use of prolonging instruc tion if the pupils during the last ten or fifteen minutes have ceased to be able to comnprehend things The question arises at once By what means can we avoid fatigue and how can fatigue be recognized and dealt with Among other things the length and occupation of recess are to be considered We are still considering the sensory motor and vasomotor effect of fatigue Here we find that which above all draws the attention of the social hygienist namely its deleterious influence upon the nervous system It is evident that the health of the pupils must suffer if they do not sufficiently recuperate from that fatigue which cannot be separated from instruction The statistics of schooldiseases have spoken here in such distinct and warning tone that physicians have for some time studied the question of fatigue Kraepelin5 the specialist for nervous dis eases in Heidelberg has treated this subject and has raised it to a special branch of psychophysical study We have to thank him for the proof that the only really effective means for restor ing strength lost by fatigue is a long and full sleep at night Not food not walking and diversions not play or change of work 6 Kraepelin Psychologische ArbeitenEXPERIMENTAL PEDAGOGY IN GERMANY 543 form the factors which actually renew strength but only sleep or at least absolute rest But what happens to school children especially in the higher schools After the mental effort in school a large amount of homework is often assigned This work is imposed upon an already fatigued pupil The next morning the boy is taught again from early morning on he has to get up before sleep the only effective means of recuperation has accomplished its work The boy comes to school still ner vously exhausted and now instruction begins again to whip up his psychical energy and to drain his nervous force This goes on and on so that Kraepelin has been able to assert that the greater number of school children find themselves during a schoolday in a continual narcosis of fatigue No wonder that the health of the pupils so often suffers Anaemia loss of appetite headache and other school diseases appear A reasonable pedagogical hygiene must give the children a full nights sleep In the German Landerziehungsheim at Ilsen burg for instance the younger pupils are given eleven hours of sleep On the whole it seems to work better if we prolong the morning sleep of the pupils instead of having them go to bed early in the evening At least in the case of the pedagogical students in Karlsruhe the state of psychical energy in the morning rose at once when from September on they went to bed an hour later and rose an hour later It is easily seen that it is doubtful whether early morning instruction is wholesome It is certain that 2 oclock is too early for the afternoon In the experiments of Wagner a pupil of Kraepelin most pupils 84 per cent show no recuperation even at 4 oclock three hours after the close of their forenoon instruction So exhausting is forenoon instruction continued up to I oclock We ought to shorten it therefore and instead use the later afternoon between 4 and 6 or 5 and 7 for the purposes of the school Here the state of energy is in itself much more favorable and a prolonged intermission is put between the forenoon and afternoon teaching But what about the time which the pupil needs for his home work The next article will answer this question

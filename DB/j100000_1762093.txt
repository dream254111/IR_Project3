Anchored at Nukualofa at ten AM on the 15th We had lovely weather all the time a nice S E wind and every one seemed highly gratified with what he had seen THE RECENT COLD TAVE THE accompanying minute maps are reduced from daily weathercharts published by the signal service and represent certain features of the weather during the passage of the recent severe cold wave The series of six maps figs 1 and 2 designed to show the changes of temperature from Jan 7 to Jan 12 are crossed by a heavy line that marks the altitude of 0 F as determined by the observations at 7 AM on successive mornings VOL VII No 155 the same time an area of high pressure with very low temperatures stood in the far northwest As is stated by Lieutenant Woodruff in his recent note on coldwaves areas of high pressure extend to the south and east with their low temperatures while the antecedent stormcentres move off to the northeast The wave here considered belongs to the third of Woodruffs classes inasmuch as it first spread southward to Texas and then east and north eastward to the Atlantic coast On Jan 8 when the stormcentre was near Mobile a fine  norther such as would have delighted Redfield swept down the plains to the Gulf and Galveston was only about ten degrees warmer than Duluth The zero isotherm stood just west of the Mississippi run ning nearly north and south for about seven hun dred miles During the next three days while the storm moved off over Labrador the cold wave crept up the Ohio valley where the temperature FIG 1 FIG 2 To the north of it the dotted area extends to th e isotherm of 30 below zero the space shaded with lines farther north being colder still The un shaded part of the maps contains the tempera tures between 0 and 30 above the next belt covers temperatures from 30 to 50 and in a few of the maps temperatures above 50 appear in the extreme south On the morning of Jan 7 a stormcentre of moderate intensity lay in southern Texas having come across northern Mexico from the Pacific at then stood distinctly lower than in Michigan two hundred miles farther north At last on Jan 11 and 12 the zero isotherm turnied well north over the plains as more moderate temperatures re turned The most interesting phase of this spell of weather was doubtless that presented on the morning of Jan 9 when the storm had developed into a true cyclone with nearly circular isobars and remarkably low pressure at its centre in southern New Jersey At this time the barometerJANUARY 22 1886 SCIENCE at Philadelphia read reduced to sealevel 2869 it was 3081 in the anticyclonic centre near Lake Winnipeg a difference of over two inches in only FIG 3 1400 miles This is illustrated in fig 3 which gives the isobars for every even tenth of an inch it shows also the area dotted over which snow was falling at this time and the stormtrack is traced by a heavy broken line with a cross and a date to mark the place of the centre at seven oclock in the morning while it lay within our territory The numerous wrecks along our coast attest the violence of the winds at this time When the monthly weather review for January comes out we shall hope to find a detailed ac count of this storm especially from those stations along the coast that lay close on the path of its centre Fig 4 for the sanme date is designed to illus trate the extraordinarily low temperatures brought by the cold wave in the rear of the cyclone The 4    FIG 4 mean temperatures for January are taken from Lieutenant Greelys monograph 1881 and drawn in broken lines for every ten degrees By com paring these with the six temperature maps above the amount of departure from the normal may be estimated The departure for Jan 9 is given by two shaded areas showing a depression of thirty and forty degrees respectively this depression being calculated from the mean January tempera ture at 7 AM as given in the chief signal officers report for 1884 The temperatures reached in the southern states on this and the following days are in all cases close to the recorded minimum of earlier years and in many cases are lower than any thing known in the signalservice stations there Altogether the storm and the cold wave are perfect examples of their unpleasant kind W M D AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHEOLOGY THE fourth number of the American journal of archeology which has just appeared in Baltimore completes the first volume and fully sustains the high expectations which were entertained of its management Nearly five hundred pages illus trated by eleven plates and sixteen figures have been given to the subscribers but the quality of the articles is more noteworthy than the quantity No other archeological journal of any country affords so comprehensive a view of the progress of investigation and discussion All important reviews and monographs and books are noticed by competent readers and critics whose names are appended as authority for the statements which are presented The proceedings of soci eties are also recorded Although chiefly con cerned with the archeology of civilizednations prehistoric remains are not neglected  but the effort is made to represent in one journal all the varied movements of the science The managing editor A L Frothingham jun PhD by his complete familiarity with the French Italian and German languages and by his long residence in Rome has become acquainted with the leading authorities and has been able to secure their en couragement and to a considerable extent their cooperation in his undertaking A list of those Europeans who have already made or who have promised at an early day to make contributions to the American journal of archeology includes the names of such wellknown persons as Piper of Berlin Reber of Munich Michaelis of Strassburg Schreiber of Leipzig Ramsay of Oxford Babelon Reinach Mfintz and de Marsy of Paris de Rossi Marucchi and Helbig of Rome Hildebrand of Stockholm  Lambros of Athens and many more Many of our countrymen are also enlisted in the enterprise With such an array of names a good series of papers would of course be expected and the re sult has been satisfactory In the latest number the most noteworthy article is perhaps that of Professor Merriam on that remarkable code re cently discovered at Gortynia in Crete So long ago as 1857 an inscribed stone built into the walls of a mill on the banks of the Cretan river 71

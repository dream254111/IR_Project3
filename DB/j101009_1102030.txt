Supreme Court of Arkansas in Peoples Saving Bank v Big Rock Stone  Construction Co 99 Southwestern Reporter 836 takes the position that a bank of which the mayor of a city is a stockholder and president cannot collect on an assigned claim for work done under a contract with the city where the work was not approved when the assignment to the bank was made and the officers of the city are by statute prohibited from being interested in contracts with the city Shipowners Liability for Violating Regulations in Carrying Ref ugeesA case of particular human interest is that of The Charles Nelson 149 Federal Reporter 146 recently decided by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Washington In this case it appeared that a vessel leaving San Francisco at the time of the earthquake had without any fault of the officers thereof taken on board more than the legal number of passengers allowed Libel was filed against the vessel to recover the statutory penalty but the court dismissed the libel using the following language It is the opinion of the court however that the extraordinary conditions ex isting at San Francisco when the voyage was undertaken justify and require the exercise of judicial discretion and that according to prin ciples of equity the libellants are not entitled to prevail    It is painly apparent that the desire of libellants to get away from San Francisco was too strong to admit of any questioning of the sufficiency of the accommodations afforded by the Charles Nelson before going aboard of her and their demands are as ungracious as would be the case if they had been castaways and were suing the rescuing ship which had brought them away from a desolate shore DefamationPrinting Report of Ghost Haunting PremisesThe reckless publication of a report as to premises being haunted by a ghost raises a presumption of malice sufficient to support an action for damages for depreciation in the value of the property loss and rent and expenses incurred in consequence of such publication Bar rett v Associated Newspapers 23 Times L R 666 distinguished in Manitoba Free Press Co v Nagy Validity of Building Ordinance Relating to Gas ReservoirsIn State v Withnell 110 Northwestern Reporter 680 it was contended that an ordinance requiring the written consent of all the property owners within a radius of one thousand feet before a gas reservoir could be erected was unconstitutional because it was or might be come prohibitory on account of the difficulty or impossibility of pro curing unanimous consent of all the property owners in any locality and because it assumed to confer on individual property owners within 738 Janthe prescribed radii absolute and arbitrary powers the exercise of which was dependent solely upon caprice and which had no nec essary connection with public safety health or morals and was of such a nature that the governing body itself could not safely or law fully be entrusted with them The Nebraska Supreme Court in deciding the case adopted the above arguments and held the act un constitutional as an unlawful delegation of power Insurance RebatesThough the giving of rebates by life insurance companies is prohibited by law an insurance contract procured by the giving of such rebates is neither illegal nor invalid so as to authorize the insured to recover the premiums paid on such contract Such is the decision of the Wisconsin Supreme Court in Laun v Pacific Mu tual Life Insurance Company 111 Northwestern Reporter 660 Right to Sell Artesian WaterThe Supreme Court of Colorado in City of La Junta v Heath 88 Pacific Reporter 459 held an ordi nance requiring persons peddling artesian water to obtain a permit and to pay a license tax to be void as interfering with the right to pursue a lawful calling The court said that the business of selling water was a lawful occupation and distinguishable from the business of selling liquor where the character of the person applying for the privilege became a proper subject of inquiry Granting the right to a city to make the proper health regulations relative to its water supply the court held that the ordinance in question was not enacted for that purpose Anomalous Indorsement of NoteIn Kistner v Peters 79 North eastern Reporter 311 the Supreme Court of Illinois passes upon the construction to be put on an anomalous indorsement of a promissory note The payee had placed on the back of the note above her name the following indorsement I hereby acknowledge myself a princi pal maker of this note with E N R and my liability as such princi pal jointly with him But the court held her liability to be that of an indorser and not a maker In the course if its discussion of the case the court said that it was undoubtedly true that it made no dif ference as to the position in which the names appeared on the note but the liability incurred was to be determined by the intent of the parties that a note payable to ones self is void until assigned and it could not be believed that the payee meant to nullify the instrument by her indorsement Duty of Carrier to Maintain Service According to ScheduleThe New York Supreme Court in

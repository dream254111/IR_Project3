FOREIGN TRADE OF THE UNITED STATES BY G G HUEBNER Harrison Fellow in Transportation and Commerce University of Pennsyl vania Philadelphia The present agitation in favor of tariff revision is based pri marily upon the necessity of increasing the foreign market for the American surplus First there is a growing surplus of manufac tured products which is obliged to seek a greater market in South America Oceanica Africa foreign North America and the non manufacturing countries of Europe Second there is a surplus of agricultural produce which has greater difficulty than formerly in finding a foreign market Third the task of the American exporter has become greater because of the increasing foreign competition and the almost universal tendency of foreign nations toward greater stringency in tariff legislation The tariff question today is preeminently a matter of foreign commerce Consequently it is of practical interest to analyse those provisions which were inserted into the tariff laws of the United States for the purpose of promoting foreign commerce and to determine their relative importance An examination of the sec tion relating to foreign commerce in the various tariffs of the United States Table I will show that such provisions may be divided into I those designed to promote the Oriental trade 2 shipping protection 3 shipping reciprocity 4 reciprocity treaties and

II Ten per cent discrimination against foreign vessels except where otherwise provided by law or treaty For application of reciprocity provisions see Table III The Oriental TradeImmediately after the Revolutionary War there began a period of brisk foreign commerce in which the American merchants sought to trade direct with markets formerly reached through Great Britain and Europe In I7841 the direct trade with China commenced and at about the same time American East Indiamen began their first voyages2 In I789 with the first tariff law enacted by the national government began a series of provisions which so stimulated this Oriental trade as to make it an important factor throughout the early commercial life of America3 This law imposed a duty on tea direct from India and China in American vessels ranging from 6 to 20 cents per pound but on tea from Europe the duty ranged from 8 to 26 cents and on tea in foreign vessels from 15 to 45 cents per pound Likewise all other Oriental products imported in foreign vessels were obliged to pay a duty or I25 per cent ad valorem or almost twice the rate levied on imports in American vessels Even as late as 1830 provisions similar to these were reenacted in subsequent tariff laws Largely because of these tariff provisions the Oriental trade rapidly became an important factor in the commerce of Salem Boston New York Providence Philadelphia and Baltimore It resulted in the establishment of various manufacturing industries T7 S Monthly Summary of Commerce and Finance June 1901 2Pitkins Statistics p 185 Marvln American Merchant Marine p 40 501The Atnnals of the American Academy such as silk spinning and finishing and the production of morocco leather4 and laid the foundation of those great fortunes which constitute the origin of the wealth of so many of the older New England families5 The favorable tariffs were taken advantage of especially by the Massachusetts merchants who brought back immense quantities of tea spices sugar coffee silks nankeen and other clothsall of them of great value in proportion to their bulk and therefore yielding heavy profits in the carrying trade and whatever did not find a market at home was reshipped from New England ports and sold at Hamburg or Northern Europe It may be said that the marked commercial feature of the period was the development of this trade6 The intent of these laws was I to increase the trade with the East 2 to confine it to American vessels and both of these aims were successfully effected But the importance of this legislation from the standpoint of modern tariff revision is considerably dimmed by the difference in commercial needs The demand throughout this early trading was for the direct importation of Oriental products while the demand today as regards the Far East is for the development of a vast market for the growing American surplus Protection to ShippingThe second group of tariff provisions which was an appreciable factor during the early growth of Amer ican foreign commerce provided for protection to American ship ping Under the law of I789 imports in American vessels received a discount of Io per cent below the general tariff rates In I794 however this was changed so that imports in foreign vessels were obliged to pay an increase of Io per cent In this form the pro tection to shipping was maintained until 1815 when its outer garments were removed by the introduction of shipping reciprocity in the direct trade with foreign nations and it was still further weakened in 1828 when the President was authorized to suspend it also in the indirect trade with all nations which would reciprocate Thereafter the 10 per cent discrimination against foreign vessels was repeatedly reenacted in practically all subsequent tariff laws of importance and it appears even in the Dingley act but after 1828 4Report of Sec Chase p 35 5Soley Marine Industries of America Ibid 502 62Provisions for Promlotion of Foreign Trade the provision applies only to those foreign vessels which by law or treaty are not entitled to shipping reciprocity In the early tariff laws American shipping was further pro tected by discriminatory tonnage duties The law of I804 levied a light money tax of 50 cents per ton on foreign vessels and in I8I2 this was increased to I5o The identical law of I8I5 how ever which was above mentioned sounded also the death knell of this form of shipping protection in the direct foreign trade Though in exceptional instances discriminating tonnage duties were there after increased reciprocity steadily gained ground In 1817 tonnage duties were further increased in the case of nations barring American vessels and occasionally exorbitant taxes were imposed upon ves sels of particular nations such as the duty of I8 against French vessels in 1820 but their intent was to enforce shipping reciprocity and not to protect American vessels As in the case of discriminat ing tariffs on commodities so provision was made in 1828 for the removal of discriminating tonnage duties in all foreign trade in direct as well as direct Finally in 1832 the President was given definite authority to reciprocate in the matter of hostile tonnage duties The present law passed in 1884 and amended in I886 imposes a duty of three cents per tonbut not exceeding fifteen cents annuallyupon all vessels entering from foreign ports of North America Central and South America the West Indies and the Bahamas and of six cents per tonbut not exceeding thirty cents annuallyupon vessels from the ports of other nations It further provides that the President shall suspend so much of this duty as may be in excess of the duty imposed upon American vessels in any given port The effect of protection to American shipping was decidedly stimulating In 1789 the American merchant marine carried I75 per cent of the imports and 30 per cent of the exports five years later these proportions were 90 and 88 per cent respectively The importance of the American merchant marine increased until the War of I812 when all trade declined but by 1820 it again carried go per cent of the imports and 80 per cent of the exports Though the absolute tonnage of American vessels engaged in the foreign trade reached its climax in I86I with a total of 2496894 tons their relative position began to decline in the later 30s In 1905 the absolute tonnage of the American merchant marine was 954513 503 63The Annals of the American Academy and it carried but I43 per cent of the imports and 75 per cent of the exports7 The remarkable growth of the merchant marine during the period of shipping protection was due partly to the natural advan tages for shipbuilding and its later decline largely to the disap pearance of these advantages with the advance of steam navigation the use of steel in the shipbuilding industry and the rise of more profitable fields for the investment of American capital But the stimulating influence of shipping protection was clearly recognized Shipping ReciprocityAs was noted above the first blow to shipping protection was delivered in I815 when provision was made to remove it in the direct trade with foreign nations and the second in 1828 when similar provision was made for the indirect trade Although the effect of this liberal legislation was disastrous to American shipping its intent was to promote both the shipping industry and foreign commerce The belief was prevalent that the American merchant marine was then so firmly entrenched that if shipping reciprocity were established with foreign nations it would destroy foreign shipping in the American trade8 It was held that as long as American tariffs granted protection to shipping foreign nations would continue to levy hostile tariffs against American vessels and prevent their successful competition In 1828 Senator Levi Woodbury of New Hampshire for example said By this bill we now hold out the olive branch to all If our terms are accepted we may obtain most of the transportation now enjoyed by foreigners in the eight or ten hundredths of our foreign ton nage as they are now enabled to compete with us to that extent chiefly by the discrimination they enjoy at home9 The extension of the provisions for shipping reciprocity with the various foreign nations is indicated in Table II At various times reciprocity was suspended to favor particular nations but only temporarily and for the purpose of further re moving foreign restrictions against American vessels For example in 1872 it was suspended in the case of French vessels in the indirect trade but after France had removed her discriminations it was at once reenacted 7U S Commerce and Navigation Reports Per cents for 1904

Academy The original intent of shipping reciprocity was to benefit Amer ican shipping but its ultimate effect in this respect was detrimental It was the American marine and not those of foreign nations which declined in the subsequent free competition Though there may have been considerable decline even if shipping protection had been retained the force of competition was greatly increased by the introduction of shipping reciprocity Reciprocity Treaties and AgreementsDuring the later period of tariff legislation the most important provisions enacted with the intent of promoting foreign commerce were those providing for commercial reciprocity An examination of Table III will indicate that the first treaty of this character was negotiated with Canada and took effect in I855 It provided for commercial reciprocity on a large number of agricultural and forest products This treaty favored Canada more than the United States It was negotiated at the time when protectionism was almost extinct and was intended as the first step toward free tradell With the exception of rice cotton tar pitch turpentine and tobacco prac tically all the articles included in the treaty were those of which Canada had a surplus The manufacturing products which the American exporter desired to market in the provinces were not included in the treaty provisions and in order to replenish the revenue lost because of the free trade in agricultural products Canada at once increased the tariff on those of the manufacturing industries During the years from 1855 to 1859 the rates on molasses were increased flom I6 to 30 per cent on boots and shoes from 125 to 25 per cent and on cotton woolen silk and iron goods from 125 to 20 per cent12 Imports from Canada increased rapidly but the effect upon the market for the products of the United States was unfavorable When in I866 the renewal of the treaty was under considera tion hostile sentiment had become so strong that it failed The main reasons for this hostility were i Public sentiment had returned to protection 2 there was a strong sentiment against Canada and Great Britain because of their attitude during the Civil War 3 the Southern Party in England was attempting to weaken the relations of the United States with Canada 4 special interests were Stanwood American Tariff Controversies Vol II p 136 Laughlin and Willis Reciprocity p

extended by an agreement now being negotiated xThe Annlals of the American Academy pressed by Canadian competition forcing them to reduce prices to the consumer where otherwise they would have found it easy to maintain them13 and 5 the United States had drawn the short end in the commercial arrangement The treaty was not commercially satisfactory but the political influences mentioned played an important role at the time of its dis continuance Charles F Adams went so far as to say that all these measures for discontinuance were the result rather of a strong political feeling than of any commercial consideration14 The Hawaiian Reciprocity Treaty which became effective in 1876 and which was renewed with but slight changes in 1887 continued until the annexation of the islands and in striking con trast with the Canadian experiment was both politically and com mercially successful It placed practically all the products of the Hawaiian Islands upon the free list and practically all American exports to the islands especially those of the manufacturing indus tries were likewise admitted free of duty Immediately after the treaty became effective the export trade with Hawaii increased from 662164 in 1876 to I272949 in I877 and the import trade from 1376681 to 2550335 Throughout the twentytwo years of the treatys life both the import and export trade increased with but few interruptions But the chief aim of the treaty was political The opinion was commonly expressed at the time of its negotiation that unless the United States secured control of the islands they would fall into the hands of Great Britain They were desirable as a stepping stone to the markets of the Orient and it was hoped that the treaty would finally result in annexation The clause which prevented Hawaii from extending similar privileges to other nations and the free entrance of all her chief products were highly instrumental in confining Hawaiian commerce almost exclusively to the United States and in causing an extensive investment of American capital in Hawaiian sugar plantations and general industries15 When this was accomplished the political annexation was but the climax to the successful termination of the reciprocity treaty These however were but isolated treaties ald no general pro visions for reciprocity were enacted until I890 The movement was 13Laughlin and Willis Reciprocity p 64 4House Ex Doc Thirtyninth Cong 1st Sess Vol I Part I p 111 1Laughlin and Willis pp 8384 508 68Provisions for Promotion of Foreign Trade supported by Secretary Blaine who even at this time when the manufacturing surplus was relatively small said I wish to de clare the opinion that the United States has reached a point where one of its highest duties is to enlarge the area of its foreign trade    I mean the expansion of trade with countries where we can find profitable exchanges These countries he believed were Mexico and the republics of Central and South America His aim was to inaugurate free trade in the Western Hemisphere on a large number of articles Though the reciprocity desired by Secretary Blaine was de feated by the special interests representing wool copper wood and ores16 the sentiment favoring an extension of the foreign markets succeeded in enacting a provision for limited retaliation Section 3 of the McKinley Act provided that if the President believed that any nation exporting sugar molasses coffee hides or any such articles imposed duties upon American products which he consid ered reciprocally unequal he might remove these imports from the free list and impose upon them the duties specified by law As is shown in Table III under this section of the McKinley Act agree ments were formed with Germany AustroHungary and various countries of the West Indies and Central and South America The effect of these agreements was however but slight be cause all were virtually abrogated by the Wilson Act of I894 Ger many removed the restrictions against American meats and levied the conventional German tariff on most of the agricultural imports and AustroHungary extended most favored nation treatment to American products The trade with both of these nations was favorably affected17 but of all the agreements with the West India Islands and Central and South America the Cuban agreement alone resulted in an increased trade The remainder of these markets were as yet so undeveloped and were so lacking in the essential commercial machinery that it would be unreasonable to expect a spontaneous response to tariff arrangements which lived but two or three years The McKinley agreements contained the basis for an expansion of foreign commerce but their existence was terminated by the approaching wave of free trade agitation When four years after the enactment of the Wilson Act the Stanwood II p 280 Speech of Sen Gibson of Louisiana 17U S Commerce and Nay Repts 18921894 509 69The Annals of the American Academy 70 Republican party was overwhelmingly reelected protectionist senti ment had reached its climax Though there was again a demand for increased foreign markets protectionism was so strong that the reciprocity provisions of the Dingley Act were distinctly weaker than those of seven years prior The first part of section 3 which was intended for France and Germany provides that the President may negotiate reciprocity agreements by reducing the tariffs upon argols crude tartar wine lees brandies spirits champagne and sparkling wines still wines vermuth paintings and statuary The second part of this section contains an equally scanty list of articles coffee tea tana beans vanilla beans or any such articlesand was inserted to favor the Central and South American republics Besides these provisions the present tariff law contains a section which upon paper appears farreaching but which in reality was inserted rather for policy than for expected results Section 4 pro vides that the President may negotiate reciprocity treaties with any nationbut he may not go below 20 per cent of the Dingley rates and such treaties must be concluded within two years and must be ratified by Congress Under section 4 of the Dingley Act eleven treaties18 were successfullly negotiated but not one was ever ratified by the Senate But under section 3 in spite of the meagerness of its provisions agreements were made with Germany France Italy Portugal and Switzerland Germany again removed the restrictions from Amer ican meats and granted the full conventional tariff to the great bulk of imports from the United States The agreement with France extended the French minimum tariff to a limited number of Amer ican agricultural products The Italian and Portuguese agreements were based upon a limited number of both agricultural and manu factured products and the Swiss agreement which was abolished was based upon the most favored nation clause of the commercial treaty of I850 The export tradel9 with Germany has increased from I84648094 in 900oo to I91271367 in 1905 and that it is partly due to the agreement which will end on June 30 I907 unless further extended is unquestionable But on the other hand the agreement with France is handicapped by the meagerness of its own sThese treaties known as the Kasson Treaties were with Jamaica Turks and Caicos Islands Barbados Bermuda British Guiana Dutch West Indies Dominican Republic Nicaragua Ecuador Argentina and France U S Commerce and Navigation Reports 1900 and 1905 50oProvisions for Promotion of Foreign Trade provisions and in recent years American exports to Italy and Portu gal have sharply declined The last reciprocal tariff arrangement entered into by the United States is the Cuban treaty of I903 Cuba by her position is commercially bound to the United States yet largely because of Spanish possession aided by prohibitive Spanish tariffs the natural tendencies of trade were for decades so diverted that though Cuban merchants found their chief market in America they bought but few American products Even as late as I904 the United States marketed 836 per cent20 of Cubas exports but furnished only 427 per cent of her imports Political enthusiasm was doubt less an important factor in the negotiations but there was also a permanent desire especially from the standpoint of exports to stimulate the American trade with Cuba To accomplish this it was soon found that the Dingley Act was inadequate and the negotiations resulted not in an Executive agree ment limited to a scanty list of commodities but in a very complete and closely woven treaty The United States agreed to admit all dutiable products of Cuba at a reduction of 20 per cent of the gen eral tariff rates Cuba agreed to admit a long list of enumerated American products at reductions of 25 30 and 40 per cent and all other dutiable goods at a reduction of 20 per cent Both the United States and Cuba moreover mutually agreed that the concessions granted in the treaty should be distinctly preferential and should be extended to no other nation The growth of trade with Cuba in recent years has been almost spectacular21 and was effectively stimulated by the treaty In I9oo the imports from Cuba were valued at 31371704 and in 1905 at 86304259 Similarly in I9oo the exports of American products to Cuba were valued at 252368o8 and in I905 at 36407932 While the Cuban treaty clearly indicates what can be accomplished by framing tariff provisions with the intention of promoting foreign trade it is an isolated and exceptional instance as the trade with Cuba comprises but 47 per cent of the total foreign commerce of the United States22 Miscellaneous ProvisionsAs is shown in Table I numerous miscellaneous tariff provisions designed to promote foreign com U S Commerce and Navigation Report 1905 pp 3435 lIbid 19001905 Ibid 1905 p 44 5II 7IThe Annals of the American Academy merce have been enacted from time to time From the very begin ning reexport drawbacks were granted At first they were limited both as to the number of articles and as to time but in I86I a gen eral reexport drawback of go per cent was established In I890 under the McKinley Act it was provided that if raw products were imported and then manufactured and reexported 99 per cent of the original duty paid shall be refunded and this provision was renewed in all subsequent tariff laws Likewise from time to time regula tions were made for the bonding of goods in transit In 1864 treaty arrangements were made with Japan whereby certain articles were placed upon the Japanese free list and others were given a tariff of five per cent Three years later the commercial treaty with Mada gascar extended the most favored nation treatment to American products In I871 a treaty with Great Britain removed discrimi nating tonnage charges on the Great Lakes and various Canadian canals and rivers and in I892 in order to enforce this treaty retaliatory tolls were levied upon vessels going through the St Marys Falls Canal to Canada Both the Wilson and Dingley Acts permit articles for the building of vessels designed for the foreign trade to enter free of duty but this has never had an appreciable effect because it is at the same time provided that such vessels can engage in the coastwise trade but two months annually Both of these laws further permit articles needed for the repair of vessels engaged in the foreign trade to enter free of duty Finally the Ding ley Act provides that the petroleum binding twine and sulphuric acid of no nation which discriminates against the American product shall be upon the free list yet this again has but a meager effect because the United States imports but an insignificant quantity of such commodities Other provisions enumerated in Table I were at various times enacted but all are distinctly a secondary factor in the general tariff schedules ConclusionFrom an analysis of the tariff schedules it be comes evident that throughout the entire tariff history provisions have been inserted for the purpose of promoting foreign commerce During the first period of tariff legislation the chief provisions of this character were those designed to promote the Oriental trade and to protect American shipping During the later period the reciprocity treaties and agreements were of primary importance as regards foreign commerce It is moreover evident that when considered 512 72Provisions for Promotion of Foreign Trade by themselves provisions of this character were both numerous and not without appreciable effect When however these provisions are regarded as part of the aggregate tariff system both their number and effect are strikingly unimportant The predominating factor has been protection and from the commercial standpoint this has always been framed to promote the domestic rather than the foreign market As early as I79I Alexander IHamilton argued that a foreign market is both small and unstable and that a domestic market is greatly to be preferred23 When after the War of 1812 the infant industries were threatened by a flood of foreign imports and the farmers were complaining of an unstable market for their products the home market argument was actively propounded It reached its first climax in I820 when the demand for a domestic market drew the western and middle agricultural interests in favor of protection24 The intent of tariff legislation as regards foreign commerce during the entire period before the reaction of 1846 is expressed in the words of Henry Clay It is most desirable that there should be both a home and a foreign market But with respect to their rela tive superiority I cannot entertain a doubt The home market is first in order and paramount in importance From I846 to I86I there was a free trade reaction but as soon as the protectionist forces successfully rallied the old preference for the domestic market again appeared with its accustomed vigor Even during the first administration of President Cleveland the home market argument was successfully appealed to The McKinley Act likewise though it contained the most important reciprocity provisions ever enacted by Congress was manifestly protective Professor Rabenno writes The predominating characteristics of the famous McKinley Bills is a spirit of absolute aversion to for eign imports and to international trade25 Finally the present tariff law was enacted when protectionism was at its height its reci procity provisions are decidedly weaker than those of 1890 and its opposition to foreign imports is decidedly greater In one respect protection has indirectly resulted in an increase of exports as fQr twentyfive years an increasing proportion of 2Report on Manufacturers 1791 p 33 24State Papers Finance Volume for 1820 Annals of Congress 1st Sess 1820 Appendix etc 2American Commercial Policy p 206 513 7374 The Annals of the American Academy Americas exports have consisted of manufactured products In I88o this proportion was 125 but by I905 it had increased to 3645 per cent26 Whatever influence therefore protectionism has had upon the growth of this manufacturing surplus has indirectly re sulted in a greater export trade The influence however has been in the creation of the products and not in providing them with a foreign market Though numerous provisions were inserted into the tariff schedules for the purpose of promoting foreign commerce in the aggregate the American tariff policy was not designed to facilitate commercial relations with foreign countries In view of the wide spread adoption of dual tariff systems by foreign nations it is evi dent that in no important nation which recognizes protection do the tariff schedules give so little cognizance to foreign trade as in the United States JU S Commerce and Navigation Report 1905

CONSIDERED IT SATISFACTORILY APPEARS THAT THE BUILDING COULD NOT HAVE BEEN IN THE OCCUPANCY OF ANY OTHER PERSON THAN THE INSURED ANTD THAT THE OMISSION TO ANSWER SPECIFICALLY THE QUESTION WAS MERELY TECHNICAL AND FURTHER IT DOES NOT APPEAR IN ANY STATE OF THE CASE THAT THE OCCU PANCY OF THE BUILDING WAS A MATERIAL MATTER OR WAS RELIED UPON FOR ANY PURPOSE WHATEVER THE PROOF OF LOSS WAS IN OUR OPINION A SUB STANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE POLICY THIS IS ALL THAT CAN BE REASONABLY EXACTED AND IS ALL THAT THE LAW REQUIRES HOME INS CO V COHEN 20 GRATT 312 IT APPEARED IN

SECURE A DEBT OF 390 TO ISAAC R NEWMAN WHICH HAS BEEN ALREADY ADVERTED TO IT WAS CONTENDED THAT THE ANSWER WAS A WARRANTY THAT THE PROP ERTY WAS FREE FROM ENCUMBRANCE AND BEING UNTRUE AVOIDED THE POLICY THE TESTIMONY CONSIDERED UPON THE PRINCIPLES OF A DEMURRER TO THE EVIDENCE PROVES THAT THE LIEN OF THE DEED OF TRUST WAS MADE KNOWN TO ROBERT E HARRIS THE EMPLOYEE OF THOMAS B HARRIS  SON WHO

TATION HE REMARKING THAT THE LIEN WAS TOO SMALL TO BE NOTED AND THE INSURED HAVING BUT LITTLE EXPERIENCE IN INSURANCE MATTERS WERE NOT AWARE THAT A LIEN UPON THE STOCK OF GOODS WOULD AFFECT IN ANY WAY THE ISSUING OF THE POLICY OF INSURANCE UPON THE FORMER APPEAL THE IMPORTANT QUESTION WAS WHETHER ROBERT E HARRIS WHO SOLICITED THE INSURANCE WAS SUCH AN AGENT AS THAT HIS KNOWLEDGE WAS IMPUTABLE TO THE COMPANY THE QUESTION WAS DECIDED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND EVIDENCE OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN THE INSURED AND THE AGENT IN REGARD TO THE LIEN AT THE TIME THAT THE APPLICATION FOR THE INSURANCE WAS FILLED UP AND SIGNED WAS HELD TO BE ADMISSIBLE IT WAS CONTENDED BY THE INSURED THAT THE EXISTENCE OF THE LIEN HAV ING BEEN FULLY MADE KNOWN TO THE SOLICITING AGENT AND HIS KNOWLEDGE BEING IMPUTABLE TO

UPON THE GROUND THAT THE INSURED 100 JUNEGEORGIA HOME INS CO  TGOODE IN HIS APPLICATION HAD AFFIRMED THAT THERE WAS NO ENCUMBRANCE UPON THE PROPERTY BUT THE COURT REFUSED TO DO SO UPON AN APPEAL TO THIS COURT THE RULING WAS AFFIRMED AND THE EVIDENCE HELD TO BE ADMIS SIBLE NOT FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRADICTING THE APPLICATION BUT TO SHOW THAT THE ANSWER AS IT WAS WRITTEN OUGHT NOT TO BE USED

RELY UPON HIM AS THE FULL AND COMPLETE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE COMPANY IN ALL THAT WAS SAID OR DONE IN MAKING THE CONTRACT AND KNOWLEDGE OF FACTS COMMUNICATED TO HIM BY THE INSURED WAS BINDING ON THE

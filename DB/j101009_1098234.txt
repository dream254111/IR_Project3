September 12 1896 in an action of assumpsit wherein the de fendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case Eppa Hunton Jr for the plaintiff in error Jeffries  White for the defendant in error RIELY J delivered the opinion of the court This is the sequel of the case of Goode  Co v Georgia Home Ins Co reported in 92 Va 392 and comes before us upon a writ of error to the judgment of the Circuit Court rendered upon a demurrer to the evidence The policy of insurance was issued to W B Goode  Co and the suit was instituted in the name of W B Goode and A M Wright partners trading under the firm name of W B Goode  Co The objection was made that A M Wright was not proved to be a partner at the time the policy was issued and that there was consequently a variance between the allegations and the proof Whether or not he was a partner was under the circumstances of the case wholly a question of fact The testimony for the plaintiffs was positive that he was a partner at that time and while there was much testimony in behalf of the defendant Company tending to prove that he was not then a partner yet being in conflict with that for the plaintiff it must under the principles of a demurrer to the evidence be disregarded The court did not err in holding that there was no variance between the declaration and proof in that respect The damages laid in the declaration were 2000 The verdict and 1898 97VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER judgment were for 1660 with interest thereon from July 19 1891 making the aggregate amount of the recovery at the time of the judg ment 2174 which was in excess of the damages claimed in the dec laration This was not error Greater damages cannot be recovered than are declared for and laid in the conclusion of the declaration but the restriction is confined to the amount of damagesthe principal of the recovery and does not affect the interest that may be allowed thereon by the jury Cahill v Pintoney 4 Mun 371 It was also objected that satisfactory proofs of loss were not furnished as required by the terms of the policy The fire occurred on the night of April 16 1891 The general agents of the Company were notified on the next day of the loss and in response to the notice the Companys special agent and adjuster R P Spencer came and fully investigated the matter The insured exhibited to him the inventory that had recently been taken of the stock of goods amounting to 352705 their books and all evidences then in their possession They also informed him of a deed of trust on the goods which was given by W B Goode to secure the sum of 390 to Isaac R Newman and told him of the conversation had with the soliciting agent in regard to the lien at the time that he took the application for the insurance Not hearing from the Company after the visit of the adjuster they wrote to the Company on April 28th in regard to the matter and received in reply a letter from its secretary dated May 5th in which he acknowledged the receipt of their letter and stated that he had also received Mr Spencers report of his in vestigation but referred them to the requirements of their policy in case of loss and enclosed a blank form of proof of loss for their use This was promptly filled out and returned to the Company but its receipt was not acknowledged until June 15th when Mr Spencer wrote and informed them that the proof of loss was unsatisfactory be cause 1 it omitted to state the occupancy of the building in which the goods were burned 2 did not give the names of the parties insured under the policy and 3 did not give copy of policy of other insurance He also informed them that the Company demanded the original or properly certified duplicate invoices of the goods destroyed and concluded his letter with the assurance that when these Idefects  were cured the Company would give prompt attention to the alleged claim Where there is any valid objection to a proof of loss it should be communicated to the insured within a reasonable time or the objection 98 JuneGEORGIA HOME INS CO V GOODE will be deemed to have been waived There was much delay in doing so in the present case Nor was the proof of loss justly obnoxious to the objections made to it on the part of the Company In it were stated the names of the parties insured The name of the Company in which they had other insurance the amount thereof the date and term of the policy and rate of premium together with the endorse ments on the policy were also stated More than this could not well have been given in the space set apart for this purpose in the blank form for proof of loss furnished to them by the Company Certainly a copy of the policy with its innumerable stipulations forfeitures and provisions could not have been inserted and moreover the form did not call for it It is true that the specific question as to the occupancy of the building was not expressly answered yet when the whole proof is considered it satisfactorily appears that the building could not have been in the occupancy of any other person than the insured antd that the omission to answer specifically the question was merely technical And further it does not appear in any state of the case that the occu pancy of the building was a material matter or was relied upon for any purpose whatever The proof of loss was in our opinion a sub stantial compliance with the requirements of the policy This is all that can be reasonably exacted and is all that the law requires Home Ins Co v Cohen 20 Gratt 312 It appeared in evidence that the original invoices were destroyed but on demand of the Company the insured went to work and after diligent effort obtained duplicate invoices as far as it was practicable to do so and when they had obtained them they wrote and so in formed the Company It made no reply and took no notice of their letter They then placed their case in the hands of attorneys who in an urgent letter courted a further investigation by the Company of the claim if not satisfied of its validity and courteously asked that they should at least be informed of the intention of the Company as to its payment Their communication also was allowed to go un answered The conduct of the Company was a waiver of any right to require the insured to do more in regard to the invoices than they had done The real defence to the claim of the plaintiffs was founded upon an encumbrance subsisting on the property at the time of the insurance which it was alleged was not disclosed to the company In the application for insurance in reply to the question Is the property mortgaged  the answer No was given There was in 99 1898VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER fact the deed of trust thereon executed by W B Goode to secure a debt of 390 to Isaac R Newman which has been already adverted to It was contended that the answer was a warranty that the prop erty was free from encumbrance and being untrue avoided the policy The testimony considered upon the principles of a demurrer to the evidence proves that the lien of the deed of trust was made known to Robert E Harris the employee of Thomas B Harris  Son who were general agents of the Company at the time he solicited the in surance and the application therefor was made out upon which the policy was issued and that the answer No was written at his dic tation he remarking that the lien was too small to be noted and the insured having but little experience in insurance matters were not aware that a lien upon the stock of goods would affect in any way the issuing of the policy of insurance Upon the former appeal the important question was whether Robert E Harris who solicited the insurance was such an agent as that his knowledge was imputable to the Company The question was decided in the affirmative and evidence of what passed between the insured and the agent in regard to the lien at the time that the application for the insurance was filled up and signed was held to be admissible It was contended by the insured that the existence of the lien hav ing been fully made known to the soliciting agent and his knowledge being imputable to the Company it was estopped to interpose the fact of the encumbrance as a defence against its liability upon the policy Authorities to sustain the proposition are abundant Mlutual Fire Ins Co v Ward

Wtest 76 Va 575 the insured testi fied that he informed the agent who negotiated the insurance that he had no title to the land but only a title bond and had paid no part of the purchase money that the agent told him that as the money was not due it was no encumbrance and that he therefore wrote in the application that the property was not encumbered The defen dant moved to exclude this evidence upon the ground that the insured 100 JuneGEORGIA HOME INS CO  TGOODE in his application had affirmed that there was no encumbrance upon the property but the court refused to do so Upon an appeal to this court the ruling was affirmed and the evidence held to be admis sible not for the purpose of contradicting the application but to show that the answer as it was written ought not to be used against the insured upon the ground of an equitable estoppel In that case the vendors lien for the whole of the purchase money encumbered the title Upon the explanation of the agent that be cause the money was not due it was no encumbrance the applicant wrote in the application that there was no encumbrance This court held that the admission of evidence to show this was proper as tending to prove an equitable estoppel It follows that if the evidence estab lished the fact the Company was estopped from relying on the un truthfulness of the answer as a ground of forfeiture of the policy In this case there was a deed of trust on the stock of goods for 390 The agent when the application was being filled up was in formed of the lien but stated that the amount was too small to be noted and under the influence of his explanation and superior knowl edge and at his dictation it was stated in the application that there was no encumbrance This fact being proved it equally created an estoppel in this case and the Company could not rely on the existence of the deed of trust as a ground of forfeiture The principle contended for by the defendants in error was dis tinctly enunciated by Judge Staples in discussing and approving the instructions given in Southern Mutual Ins Co v Yates supra While it was contended for the plaintiff in error that the agent had no power to waive any condition of the policy or ground of forfeiture it was not pretended that there was any express limitation in the ap plication on the powers of the agent but it was earnestly insisted that the questions propounded in the application were in themselves from their nature notice to the insured of the limited powers of the agent and an ingenious and able argument was made to bring the case within the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in Fletchers case Of that case Keith P in Mutual Fire Ins Co v Ward supra said It has been supposed in some quarters that the case of Insurance Co v Fletcher 117 U S 519 impaired the authority of the case just cited Wilkinsons case but this impression proceeds upon a misapprehension of the latter case It cites with approval the doctrine enunciated in Wilkinsons case but points out that knowledge of the limitations upon the authority of the agent was brought home 1898 101VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER to the insured because those limitations were stated in the application signed by him The case at bar is easily distinguishable from Fletchers case There the assured had only to read the printed lines of the application signed by him to see and learn that it stipulated that the rights of the Com pany could in no respect be affected by his verbal statements or by those of its agents unless the same were reduced to writing and for warded with his application to the home office It was his duty to read the application which he signed and he was chargeable with no tice of what it contained But in this case the printed application contains no limitation upon the powers of the agent The insured in its absence had the right to presume that the powers of the agent were commensurate with the business entrusted to his care and to look to and rely upon him as the full and complete representative of the Company in all that was said or done in making the contract And knowledge of facts communicated to him by the insured was binding on the Company unless special limitations upon his powers were known to the insured or plainly appeared from the nature of his em ployment The record fails to disclose that any limitations upon the powers of the agent were brought home to the insured either in the application or otherwise The defence of forfeiture was waived upon another ground Not only was R P Spencer the special agent and adjuster informed of the lien when investigating the fire just after its occurrence but in the proof of loss the following distinct statement of the lien was made Note There was a mortgage given by W P Goode individually to the amount of three hundred and ninety dollars which fact was made known to the agent when filling up our application and his the agents instructions were not to make any note of it as he said it was too small to make any difference The Company as hereinbefore stated objected to the proof of loss because of certain alleged defects and required new proof of loss to be made It moreover required the original invoices or certified dupli cates to be furnished but made no allusion whatever to the existence of the lien nor claimed that there was any ground of forfeiture of the policy It was only upon the theory that the policy was valid that the Com pany had any right to demand a further proof of loss or to require the invoices to be furnished If it intended to claim that the policy was void because the deed of trust was not disclosed in the applica tion it ought to have so stated or not required the insured to deliver 102 JuneGEORGIA HOME INS CO V GOODE new or additional proofs of loss and to furnish invoices of the goods destroyed It will be presumed from these circumstances that the Company elected to waive the forfeiture A party cannot occupy

knowlege of the lien of the deed of trust both through its adjuster R P Spencer and from the proof of loss when it demanded further proof and required the invoices to be furnished If it was not estopped to declare the policy void by reason of the knowledge of the soliciting agent of the lien when he took the application it had the right after acquiring actual and full knowledge of the lien either to declare the policy to be void in consequence of the lien not being disclosed in the applica tion or to treat it as valid and require the insured to furnish new proof of loss and the original or properly certified duplicate invoices of the goods that were destroyed It chose the latter course and put the insured to the trouble and expense of procuring the duplicate in voices By this decisive act done with full knowledge of the lien and of its rights if not previously estopped to insist on a forfeiture of the policy it thereby waived the right to do so The policy insured the plaintiffs to the amount of 1660 1625 1898 103VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER thereof being on the stock of goods and 35 on store furniture fix tures and safe The verdict and judgment were for 1660 the whole amount of the policy It was further contended that there was no proof in the record of the burning of any store furniture fixtures or safe and that therefore the judgment should not in any event exceed 1625 It was proved that the fire occurred in the night time about half past two oclock and that the storehouse together with the entire stock of goods was destroyed It nowhere appears in the record that there was the least contention on the trial in the court below that the abovementioned property was not destroyed or that anything was saved This point does not appear to have been pressed or relied on in the court below The facts and circumstances shown in evidence justified the jury in rendering a verdict for the whole amount of the policy The judgment of the Circuit Court must be

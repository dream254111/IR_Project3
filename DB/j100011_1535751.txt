j100011,Biological Bulletin,1535751,An Extraordinary New Maritime Fly,i268203,AN EXTRAORDINARY NEW MARITIME FLY VERNON L KELLOGG THERE have been established recently two new families of flies to which I have to add a third In the case of two of these three new families the members show great divergence from the usual dipterous condition The three genera of Wandol lecks new family Stethopathidae are wingless and are without halteres The thorax is greatly reduced and the compound eyes are feebly developed The mouthparts are of the general sort possessed by the Nematocera ie a short liplike labium without pseudotracheae a distinct labrum and a hypopharynx but no mandibles nor maxillar lobes Coquillets new family the Stenoxenidae established for a single female fly presents no such extraordinary characters as the Stethopathidae  The shape and structure of the head body and legs and the unusual development of the first antennal joint appear to indicate its nearest approach to the genus Ceratopogon of the family Chiro nomidae but the venation as well as the general appearance of the insect is very different from anything now located in that family Coquillet There has come into my hands a number of specimens 153 in all of a fly which must prove of unusual interest to zoolo gists and entomologists both because of its peculiar habitat and of its extraordinary structural condition This new fly can cer tainly not be ascribed to any known dipterous family its affini ties can only be determined in the most general way I feel constrained to establish for it a new family which may be called the Eretmopteridae The 153 specimens of the new form I39 males and 13 females and i female pupa were collected on Dec 27 1898 1 Wandolleck Bruno  Die Stethopathidae eine neue DipterenFamilie

my laboratory at Point Lobos a rocky point on the Pacific Coast near Monterey California The flies of which there were many  thousands says Mr Brown were resting or running on the surface of the ocean water of tide pools and had a tendency to gather in large numbers in patches  and in balllike masses  on the water None were seen below the surface nor were any seen flying They moved about on the surface of the water very rapidly In the last week of March 1899 I visited Point Lobos and searched carefully for the fly examining the same tide pools on which FIG IErelmoptera browni male and female Mr Brown found his specimens but no flies were to be found nor were there any dipterous larvae or pupae in these pools Mr Brown also searched again in July and August without finding more specimens So we have as yet no knowledge of the eggs and larvae nor of the course of the life history of the fly The new form may be named and described as follows Eretmoptera browni nov gen et spMale Fig i Length

vein less wings are not specially thin or delicate but on the contrary are rather thickened the costal margin being especially thick ened and perhaps folded The halteres Fig 3 ih or the structures which occupy the usual position of halteres are not of the usual pedicel and knob type common among Diptera but are minute lobe or scalelike processes appearing like rudiments of metathoracic wings like the mesothoracic wings they are rather thickened and are finely spinulose they are widest at base and taper to a rounded tip they average 08 mm in length Abdomen of nine segments tapering gradually posteriorly mottled gray and blackish above lighter below palest laterally a few scattered small wholly inconspicuous hairs the body appearing glabrous external genitalia consist ing of a pair of large conspicuous strong articulated claspers Fig 3 c which are covered with a pubescence Female Fig i Length 25 mm thus being onefourth longer than the male this extra length is all in the abdomen which is markedly larger in every way than the abdomen of the male The head and thorax are narrower than the robust abdomen which is subcylindrical tapering only slightly poste riorly Eyes as in male very small very widely separated and hairy Antennae Fig 3 ant only 4segmented Mouthparts 84 VOL INo 2 EXTRA ORDIVARY NEW MARITIME FLY essentially as in male with however appreciable differences in shape the labrumepipharynx is narrower at base and is more pointed apically the labium with paraglossae separated farther back and slightly narrower The reduced wings and halteres like those of male the wings length 85 mm slightly longer The abdomen consists of nine segments mottled blackish with conspicuous white sutural spaces caused by the distention of the abdomen The external genitalia are inconspicuous There is a short emarginate dorsal plate with rounded tips and a pair of small lateral processes There appears to be no extrusible ovipositor Pupa of Female Among the many specimens collected by Mr Brown I find a single female pupa This specimen throws the only light upon the condition of the immature life of the fly that we yet have The pupa is of that simple unpro tected unmodified type characteristic of those flies like the Cecidomyidae and Mycetophilidae whose pupae are protected by lying enclosed in plant tissue There are no projecting breathing tubes like those of the aquatic pupae and it would seem that the pupa was quite unfit for an aquatic life And yet Mr Brown took this pupa with the imagines from the sur face of a tide pool There is a puzzle here The pupa may be described as follows Length 25 mm as large as adult female Immediately recognizable as pupa of the female from the similarity in size shape and markings Abdomen just as in adult both as regards size shape color and markings The antennae legs and wings are folded on the lateral and ventral aspects of the anterior part of the body and extend backwards only to hardly reaching the posterior margin of the second abdominal segment There are no external tra cheal gills or elongated spiracles breathing tubes There are no bristles nor special clinging organs The pupa is of a very simple unmodified unprotected type The extraordinary features of the external structure of the fly are the condition of the wings and halteres The con dition of the antennae and the empodium is also unusual The reduction of the wings and loss of flight are accompanied by a reduction of the halteres the flightdirecting  organs The 85halteres being not wholly obsolete but existing still in rudimen tary condition are especially suggestive in their likeness to rudimentary wings The general affinities of the fly are shown by the character of the mouthparts and pupa to be with the simpler nematocerous families The habitat is unusual but of course not unique The discovery of the conditions of life of the immature stages may however give the matter of habi h x ant FIG 3  Eretmoptera

Represented by Algebraic Curves,i308006,ON THE DETERMINATION OF SURFACES CAPABLE OF CONFORMAL REPRESENTATION UPON THE PLANE IN SUCH A MANNER THAT GEODETIC LINES ARE REPRESENTED BY ALGEBRAIC CURVES BY HENRY FREEMAN STECKER Introduction BELTRAMI has shown t that surfaces of constant curvature can be built upon the plane in such a manner that the geodetic lines shall go over into straight lines and that this result is true for no other surface He considered this as the simplest case of building one surface upon another in such a manner that the geodetic lines of one surface shall go over into the geodetic lines of the other The general question was later solved by DINI j It is an immediate consequence of BELTRAMIS memoirs that surfaces of constant curvature are the only surfaces that can be built conformally upon the plane in such a manner that the geodetic lines shall go over into straight lines or arcs of circles  This latter fact sug gests a generalization of BELTRAMIS problem different from the one which he had in mind i e to so build a surface conformally upon the plane in such a manner that the geodetic lines shall go over into algebraic curves It is proposed to con sider that question We consider a dotubly infinite system of algebraic curves in the plane 1  F3x Y  AF2x y  BF1x y   where A and B are the parameters of the system We think of the surface as given by

CHIMZEROID EGGCASE ALMOST nothing is known of the structural characteristics of the holocephalous fishes of the Mesozoic period except dental plates or teeth The remains of such however are numerous and about a score of generic names have been proposed for them although A Smith Woodward only fully recognizes five Ganodus Ischyodus Edaphodon Callorhyn chus and Elasmodectes I was therefore much interested in a fossil which Drs Frank H Knowlton and T W Stanton referred to me for identification if possible and which I at once recognized as a chimseroid ovi capsule apparently most nearly resembling that of modern deepsea forms The interest arises from the assumption that where likeness prevails between such products not only the parts which frame them but other structures must correspond The inference is not irrefragable but in the ab sence of contradictory data perfectly legiti mate as a provisional hypothesis at least The fossilized eggcases previously known are few and the indications as to affinities interesting as well as important Three figures have been published of Jurassic egg cases two by Emil Bessels and one by Otto Jaekel All are of the Callorhynchus type and it is significant that a right palatine tooth obtained from the Lower Greensand of New Zealand has been attributed by E T Newton and Woodward to that genus and named Callorhynchus hectori The newly found fossil was obtained by Mr N H Darton of the U S Geological Survey from massive sandstone a few miles west of Laramie Wyoming The contour and general form are well pre served but nbt the details The resemblance 601 to the ovicapsules of Harriotta and Rhino chimcera lies in the absence of differentiation between the anterior and posterior portions of the lateral alse of the capsule and the uniformity of the transverse costal ridges all through It differs from the ovicapsules of both Harriotta and Rhinochimcera by the greater width of the aloe and especially the greater width and extension forward along the sides of the archidome1 The resemblance is greatest to Rhinochimcera The genus Harriotta was set apart as the type of a subfamily Harriottinae by Gill in 1896 and it was associated with Rhinochimcera in a family Rhinochimaeridae by Garman in 1904 It is to this group if a family properly nameable Harriottidse that the Wyoming fossil belongs It can not be corre lated with any one of the many generic names Eumylodus Mylognathus Dipristis Sphage pwea Diphrissa Bryactinus Isotcenia and Leptomylus that have been especially coined for American Cretaceous fossils but the naming of it if such must be done I leave to Dr Dean who is now publishing through the Carnegie Institution an elaborate work on the chimseroids I have had the privilege of looking over the proofsheets of that work and my knowledge of the ovicapsules of the Harriottidse is chiefly derived from it though I had long ago seen those of Harriotta If these determinations prove correct and the groups named families by Garman are accepted as such the curious deduction fol lows that no fossil ovicapsule of a typical chimaerid has been found as yet Although the living harriottids are deep sea forms it does not follow that a deep sea is indicated for the habitat of the extinct harriottid The character of the sandstone as well as of the basin in which the ovicapsule was found is opposed to the hypothesis of a deep sea It must be remembered too that the same genus may have species ranging from shallow water to abyssal depths Chim cera for example has a species C colliei which may be caught from a city wharf and lIn the interest of conciseness of description I would use archidome for the chamber for the head and trunk of the chimseroid and urodorme for that receiving the caudal

of a vertical tube drawn out at the lower end into a fine capillary and filled with mercury Figs 1 and 2 The upper end of the tube is joined to a cylinder in which a piston is FfG 1 FIG 2 moved by a screw thus making pressure on the mercury column The end of the capil lary dips in a reservoir containing 20 per cent sulphuric acid A little mercury is placed in the reservoir Platinum wires lead from this and the mercury in the capillary to convenient binding posts When mercury is placed in the vertical tube it enters the capillary until the weight of the column of mercury is bal anced by the surface tension If the capillary be now dipped in the reservoir containing the sulphuric acid and the piston driven upward by its screw mercury will be forced out of the capillary into the acid and on lowering the pressure the mercury will retreat within the capillary drawing the acid after it As the N S VOL XXII No 567 mercury in the capillary is kept from falling by the surface tension it is obvious that what ever increases or diminishes the surface ten sion for example an electric current will raise or lower in corresponding measure the mercury in the capillary The alteration in surface tension is accompanied by the move ment of ions between the meniscus and the remaining electrode of the electrometer the mercury in the acid reservoir In practise it is found that this movement can be neither very rapid nor long continued without in juring the sensitiveness of the instrument The potential difference from even a single element Daniell or dry cell is far too large to be used safely It is advisable to employ a potential divider or rheochord which shall permit only a fraction of the original poten tial not more than 01 volt to reach the electrometer The electrometer should be kept shortcir cuited except during an observation so that the capillary and the mercury in the reservoir may always be connected through a conductor The shortcircuit key is shown in Fig 1 A strip of spring brass connected with one of the binding posts of the electrometer rests against a second piece of brass connected with the other binding post except when depressed by the finger The point of higher potential when known should always be connected with the capillary When the capillary electrometer is con nected with two points of unlike potential the meniscus is displaced The pressure neces sary to bring it back to its original position is proportional to the electromotive force that displaced the meniscus Thus by connecting the electrometer with known differences of potential it may be experimentally graduated In practise the relation between the pressure and the potential must frequently be rede termined It is usually easier to measure differences of potential such as the demarca tion current of nerve or muscle by compensa tion In this method the electromotive force of the demarcation current is measured in fractions of a Daniell cell or any other con stant element by bringing into the same cir

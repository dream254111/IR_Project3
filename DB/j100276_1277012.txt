Iowa 320 because of the absence of the animus furandi The proposition that such taking of general property to satisfy a debt is not rob bery now seems to be as well established for the instant case overrules the one outstanding authority to the contrary Fannin v State 51 Tex Cr R 4I Neither is such taking to satisfy a debt larceny Johnson v State 73 Ala 523 Corn v Stebbins 8 Gray 492 Of course there must be a bona fide belief in the claim of right Some courts hold it robbery when the loser in a gambling transaction forces the winner to return his money Carrol v State 42 Tex Cr R 30 See Grant v State II5 Ga 205 contra As far as the law is concerned a regime of debt collectors with their courts in theif right hip pockets is discouraged only by the penalties for trespass breach of peace etc In accord with the instant case see Reg v Hemming 4 F  F 50 State v Hollyway 41 Iowa 200 State v Brownv 104 Mo 365 cited therein DAMAGESCONTINUOUS TRESPASS OR REPEATED WRONGDefendant coal company had worked over the boundary between its own claim and that of the plaintiff and removed from the plaintiffs land large quantities of coal It was admitted by the officers of the defendant corporation that they had knowledge of the encroachments upon plaintiffs property as early as January 1913 so that the original trespass must have occurred prior to that date Apparently however the defendants continued to work across the line after that time and to remove coal from the plaintiffs claim Defendants after wards abandoned these workings and allowed the superincumbent soil to cave in Late in I916 the plaintiff and his engineer recognized that these encroach ments had occurred but were denied admission to the defendants mine to ascertain the extent of the encroachments on the plea that they could not get back to the division line because of the cavein Suit was begun March 28 i918 The statute of limitations was pleaded It was held that the statute begins to run only from the time of the actual discovery of the trespass or from the time when discovery was reasonably possible not from the time of the trespass Petrelli v West Virginia Coal Co W Va I920 I04 S E 103 Attention has before been called to the fact that neither courts nor legis latures seem to be satisfied with the conclusions reached in the English case of Clegg v Deardent I848 12 Ad and El N S 575 and in the Michigan case of The National Copper Co v Minnesota Mining Co I885 57 Mich 83 on the subject of socalled continuous trespass Cf I9 MICH L Rsv 375 In the instant case the court of West Virginia has followed the court of Pennsylvania in its solution of the problem coming to a conclusion which satisfies the sense of justice but the legal theory of which is somewhat diffi cult to explain The West Virginia court cites Lewey v H C Fricke Coal Co I895 i66 Pa 536 as a precedent for its decision See also Kingston v Lehigh Valley Coal Co 1913 241 Pa 469 Although this argument gives us a just decision by postponing the time when the statute begins to run it is a little difficult to see on principle how the discovery of a wrong can be 749MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW used to date the inception of a cause of action arising from the wrong and the consequent beginning of the period of limitation If however we admit that each days concealment of the fraud is a new wrong we would have a new cause of action every day so long as the concealment continued In the instant case we have evidence of the concealment of the wrong within the statutory period in the refusal of the defendants to give to the plaintiffs access to the defendants mine The Michigan court has decided in Groendal v Westrate I912 171 Mich 92 that the plaintiffs action for malpractice of her physician was not barred by the statute although the cause of action arising from the initial negligence of the physician was barred because with in the statutory period he had fraudulently and purposely concealed from her the nature of her injury If the fraudulent concealment of the statute Act No i68 Pub Acts I905 being section 9729 3 MICH COMP LAWS as amended were generalized as a repeated wrong which would give rise to a new cause of action arising on the occurrence of such a wrong the bar of the statute of limitations would be removed whether the wrong were an injury to land as in the instant case an injury to the person as in the mal practice case Groendal v Westraie supra or an injury to reputation as in the slander or libel cases Dick v Nortlker Pac Ry Co 1915 86 Wash 211 Cf 18 MICH L REV 679 19 MICH L REV 381 EVIDENCECRIMINAL LAWPROOF OF NOONCSENT BY CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCEIn a prosecution for knowingly and unlawfully taking or killing the cattle of another no direct evidence of the owners nonconsent was of fered though the owner was present at the trial The defendant moved for a directed verdict on the ground of a lack of proof as to the nonconsent of the owner to the killing Held motion denied as there were facts from which the nonconsent could be inferred State v Parry N Mex 1920 194 Pac 864 The crime in the principal case like that of larceny rests on the non consent of the owner to the taking or the killing otherwise the act would be lawful It is the lack of consent that renders the act unlawful This non consent of the owner must be shown in order to obtain a conviction for otherwise no larceny would be established Garcia v State 26 Tex 209 As to what kind of evidence is necessary to establish the nonconsent of the owner there is some conflict An early English case in a prosecution for coursing deer without the consent of the owner held that it was necessary on the part of the prosecution to call the owner of the deer to prove that he did not give his consent to the defendant to course them Rex v Rogers 2 Camp 654 This doctrine has been entirely repudiated and rejected by later English de cisions Rex v Hazy 2 C  P 458 Rex v Allen I Moody C C I54 But that case became the foundation for the doctrine that circumstantial evidence as to the nonconsent may be resorted to only when direct evidence of the owner is not obtainable This doctrine is asserted in PHILIIPS ON EVIDENCE 4th Ed 635 and has been followed by a few states State v Osborne 28 Ia 9 At one time Nebraska and Wisconsin also asserted this doctrine Bub ster v State 33 Neb 663 State v Morey 2 Wis 495 But they have now 750

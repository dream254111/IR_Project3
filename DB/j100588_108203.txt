PHENOMENA OF BINOCULAR VISION BY CHARLES WHEATSTONE FRS PROFESSOR OF EXPERIMENTAL PHILOSOPHY IN KINGS COLLEGE LONDON RECEIVED AND READ JUNE 21 1838 VHEN AN OBJECT IS VIEWED AT SO GREAT A DISTANCE THAT THE OPTIC AXES OF BOTH EYES ARE SENSIBLY PARALLEL WHEN DIRECTED TOWARDS IT THE PERSPECTIVE PROECTIONS OF IT SEEN BY EACH EYE SEPARATELY ARE SIMILAR AND THE APPEARANCE TO THE TWO EYES IS PRECISELY THE SAME AS WHEN THE OBJECT IS SEEN BY ONE EYE ONLY THERE IS IN SUCH CASE NO DIF FERENCE BETWEEN THE VISUAL APPEARANCE OF AN OBJECT IN RELIEF AND ITS PERSPECTIVE PRO JECTION ON A PLANE SURFACE AND HENCE PICTORIAL REPRESENTATIONS OF DISTANT OBJECTS WHEN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH WOULD PREVENT OR DISTURB THE ILLUSION ARE CAREFULLY EXCLUDED MAY BE RENDERED SUCH PERFECT RESEMBLANCES OF THE OBJECTS THEY ARE INTENDED TO REPRESENT AS TO BE MISTAKEN FOR THEMN THE DIORAMA IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS BUT THIS SIMILARITY NO LONGER EXISTS WHEN THE OBJECT IS PLACED SO NEAR THE EYES THAT TO VIEW IT THE OPTIC AXES MUST CONVERGE UNDER THESE CONDITIONS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE PRO JECTION OF IT IS SEEN BY EACH EYE AND THESE PERSPECTIVES ARE MORE DISSIMILAR AS THE CONVERGENCE OF THE OPTIC AXES BECOMES GREATER THIS FACT MAY BE EASILY VERIFIED BY PLACING ANY FIGURE OF THREE DIMENSIONS AN OUTLINE CUBE FOR INSTANCE AT A MODERATE DISTANCE BEFORE THE EYES AND WHILE THE HEAD IS KEPT PERFECTLY STEADY VIEWING IT WITH EACH EYE SUCCESSIVELY WHILE THE OTHER IS CLOSED PLATE XI FIG 13 REPRESENTS THE TWO PERSPECTIVE PROJECTIONS OF A CUBE B IS THAT SEEN BY THE RIGHT EYE AND A THAT PRESENTED TO THE LEFT EVE THE FIGURE BEING SUPPOSED TO BE PLACED ABOUT SEVEN INCHES IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE SPECTATOR THE APPEARANCES WHICH ARE BY THIS SIMPLE EXPERIMENT RENDERED SO OBVIOUS MAY BE EASILY INFERRED FROM THE ESTABLISHED LAWS OF PERSPECTIVE FOR THE SAME OBJECT IN RELIEF IS WHEN VIEWED BY A DIFFERENT EYE SEEN FROM TWO POINTS OF SIGHT AT A DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER EQUAL TO THE LINE JOINING THE TWO EYES YET THEY SEEM TO HAVE ESCAPED THE ATTENTION OF EVERY PHILOSOPHER AND ARTIST WHO HAS TREATED OF THE SUBJECTS OF VISION AND PERSPECTIVE I CAN ASCRIBE THIS INATTENTION TO A PHENOMENON LEADING TO THE IMPORTANT AND CURIOUS CONSEQUENCES WHICH WILL FORM THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION ONLY TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE RESULTS BEING CONTRARY TO A PRIN CIPLE WHICH WAS VERY GENERALLY MAINTAINED BY OPTICAL WRITES VIZ THAT OBJECTS CAN 3 B2372 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION BE SEEN SINGLE ONLY WHEN THEIR IMAGES FALL ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINE AN HYPOTHESIS WHICH WILL BE HEREAFTER DISCUSSED IF THE CONSIDERATION EVER AROSE IN THEIR MINDS IT WAS HASTILY DISCARDED UNDER THE CONVICTION THAT IF THE PICTURES PRE SENTED TO THE TWO EYES ARE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES DISSIMILAR THEIR DIFFERENCES MUST BE SO SMALL THAT THEY NEED NOT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IT WILL NOW BE OBVIOUS WHY IT IS IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE ARTIST TO GIVE A FAITHFUL REPRE SENTATION OF ANY NEAR SOLID OBJECT THAT IS TO PRODUCE A PAINTING WHICH SHALL NOT BE DISTINGUISHED IN THE MIND FROM THE OBJECT ITSELF WHEN THE PAINTING AND THE OBJECT ARE SEEN WITH BOTH EYES IN THE CASE OF THE PAINTING TWO SIMILAR PICTURES ARE PROJECTED ON THE RETINAE IN THE CASE OF THE SOLID OBJECT THE PICTURES ARE DISSIMILAR THERE IS THEREFORE AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE IMPRESSIONS ON THE ORGANS OF SENSATION IN THE TWO CASES AND CONSEQUENTLY BETWEEN THE PERCEPTIONS FORMED IN THE MIND THE PAINTING THEREFORE CANNOT BE CONFOUNDED WITH THE SOLID OBJECT AFTER LOOKING OVER THE WORKS OF MANY AUTHORS WHO MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO HAVE MADE SOME REMARKS RELATING TO THIS SUBJECT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FIND BUT ONE WHICH IS IN THE TRATTATO DELLA PITTURA OF LEONARDO DA VINCI  THIS GREAT ARTIST AND INGENIOUS PHILOSOPHER OBSERVES  THAT A PAINTING THOUGH CONDUCTED WITH THE GREATEST ART AND FINISHED TO THE LAST PERFECTION BOTH WITH REGARD TO ITS CONTOURS ITS LIGHTS ITS SHADOWS AND ITS COLOURS CAN NEVER SHOW A RELIEVO EQUAL TO THAT OF THE NATURAL OBJECTS UNLESS THESE BE VIEWED AT A DISTANCE AND WITH A SINGLE EYE FOR SAYS LHE  IF AN OBJECT C PLATE X FIG 1 BE VIEWED BY A SINGLE EYE AT A ALL OBJECTS IN THE SPACE BEHIND IT IN CLUDED AS IT WERE IN A SHADOW E C F CAST BY A CANDLE AT A ARE INVISIBLE TO THE EYE AT A BUT WHEN THE OTHER EYE AT B IS OPENED PART OF THESE OBJECTS BECOME VISIBLE TO IT THOSE ONLY BEING HID FROM BOTH EYES THAT ARE INCLUDED AS IT WERE IN THE DOUBLE SHADOW C D CAST BY TWO LIGHTS AT A AND B AND TERMINATED IN D THE ANGULAR SPACE E D G BEYOND D BEING ALWAYS VISIBLE TO BOTH EYES AND THE HIDDEN SPACE C D IS SO MUCH THE SHORTER AS THE OBJECT C IS SMALLER AND NEARER TO THE EYES THUS THE OBJECT C SEEN WITH BOTH EYES BECOMES AS IT WERE TRANSPARENT ACCORDING TO THE USUAL DEFINITION OF A TRANSPARENT THING NATMELY THAT WHICH HIDES NOTHING BEYOND IT BUT THIS CANNOT HAPPEN WHEN AN OBJECT WHOSE BREADTH IS BIGGER THAN THAT OF THE PUPIL IS VIEWED BY A SINGLE EYE THE TRUTH OF THIS OBSERVATION IS THEREFORE EVIDENT BECAUSE A PAINTED FIGURE INTERCEPTS ALL THE SPACE BEHIND ITS APPARENT PLACE SO AS TO PRECLUDE THE EYES FROM THE SIGHT OF EVERY PART OF THE IMAGINARY GROUND BEHIND IT WLAD LEONARDO DA VINCI TAKEN INSTEAD OF A SPHERE A LESS SIMPLE FIGURE FOR THE PURPOSE OF HIS ILLUSTRATION A CUBE FOR INSTANCE HE WOULTD NOT ONLY HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE OBJECT OBSCURED FROM EACH EYE A DIFFERENT PART OF THE MORE DISTANT FIELD OF VIEW BUT THE FACT WOULD ALSO PERHAPS HAVE FORCED ITSELF UPON HIS ATTENTION THAT THE OBJECT ITSELF PRESENTED A DIFFERENT APPEARANCE TO EACH EYE HE FAILED TO DO THIS AND NO SUB SEQUENT

PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 373 OBVIOUSLY DISSIMILAR PICTURES ON THE TWO RETINAE WHEN A SINGLE OBJECT IS VIEWED WHILE THE OPTIC AXES CONVERGE MUST THEREFORE BE REGARDED AS A NEW FACT IN THE THEORY OF VISION  2 IT BEING THUS ESTABLISHED THAT THE MIND PERCEIVES AN OBJECT OF THREE DIMENSIONS BY MEANS OF THE TWO DISSIMILAR PICTURES PROJECTED BY IT ON THE TWO RETINAE THE FOLLOWING QUESTION OCCURS WHAT WOULD BE THE VISUAL EFFECT OF SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENTING TO EACH EYE INSTEAD OF THE OBJECT ITSELF ITS PROJECTION ON A PLANE SURFACE AS IT APPEARS TO THAT EYE TO PURSUE THIS INQUIRY IT IS NECESSARY THAT MEANS SHOULD BE CONTRIVED TO MAKE THE TWO PICTURES WHICH MUST NECESSARILY OCCUPY DIFFERENT PLACES FALL ON SIMILAR PARTS OF BOTH RETINAE UNDER THE ORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES OF VISION THE OBJECT IS SEEN AT THE CONCOURSE OF THE OPTIC AXES AND ITS IMAGES CONSEQUENTLY ARE PROJECTED ON SIMILAR PARTS OF THE TWO RETINAE BUT IT IS ALSO EVIDENT THAT TWO EXACTLY SIMILAR OBJECTS MAY BE MADE TO FALL ON SIMILAR PARTS OF THE TWO RETINAE IF THEY ARE PLACED ONE IN THE DIRECTION OF EACH OPTIC AXIS AT EQUAL DISTANCES BEFORE OR BEYOND THEIR INTERSECTION FIG 2 REPRESENTS THE USUAL SITUATION OF AN OBJECT AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES IN FIG 3 THE SIMILAR OBJECTS ARE PLACED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES BEFORE THEIR INTERSECTION AND IN FIG 4 BEYOND IT IN ALL THESE THREE CASES THE MIND PER CEIVES BUT A SINGLE OBJECT AND REFERS IT TO THE PLACE WHERE THE OPTIC AXES MEET IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT WHEN THE EYES CONVERGE BEYOND THE OBJECTS AS IN FIG 3 THE RIGHT HAND OBJECT IS SEEN BY THE RIGHT EYE AND THE LEFT HAND OBJECT BY THE LEFT EYE WHILE WHEN THE AXES CONVERGE NEARER THAN THE OBJECTS THE RIGHT HAND OBJECT IS SEEN BY THE LEFT EYE AND CONVERSELY AS BOTH OF THESE MODES OF VISION ARE FORCED AND UN NATURAL EYES UNACCUSTOMED TO SUCH EXPERIMENTS REQUIRE SOME ARTIFICIAL ASSISTANCE IF THE EYES ARE TO CONVERGE BEYOND THE OBJECTS THIS MAY BE AFFORDED BY A PAIR OF TUBES FIG 5 CAPABLE OF BEING INCLINED TOWARDS EACH OTHER AT VARIOUS ANGLES SO AS TO CORRESPOND WITH THE DIFFERENT CONVERGENCES OF THE OPTIC AXES IF THE EYES ARE TO CONVERGE AT A NEARER DISTANCE THAN THAT AT WHICH THE OBJECTS ARE PLACED A BOX FIG 6 MAY BE CONVENIENTLY EMPLOYED THE OBJECTS A A ARE PLACED DISTANT FROMG EACH OTHER ON A STAND CAPABLE OF BEING MOVED NEARER THE EYES IF REQUIRED AND THE OPTIC AXES BEING DIRECTED TOWARDS THEM WILL CROSS AT C THE APERTURE B V ALLOWING THE VISUAL RAYS FROM THE RIGHT HAND OBJECT TO REACH THE LEFT EYE AND THOSE FROIN THE LEFT HAND OBJECT TO FALL ON THE RIGHT EYE THE COINCIDENCE OF THE IMAGES MAY BE FACILITATED BY PLACING THE POINT OF A NEEDLE AT THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES C AND FIXING THE EYES UPON IT IN BOTH THESE INSTRUMENTS FIGS 5 AND 6 THE LATERAL IMAGES ARE HIDDEN FROM VIEW AND MUCH LESS DIFFICULTY OCCURS IN MAKING THE IMAGES UNITE THAN WHEN THE NAKED EYES ARE EMPLOYED NOW IF INSTEAD OF PLACING TWO EXACTLY SIMILAR OBJECTS TO BE VIEWED BY THE EYES IN EITHER OF THE MODES ABOVE DESCRIBED THE TWO PERSPECTIVE PROJECTIONS OF THE SAME SOLID OBJECT BE SO DISPOSED THE MIND WILL STILL PERCEIVE THE OBJECT TO BE SINGLE BUT INSTEAD OF A REPRESENTATION ON A PLANE SURFACE AS EACH DRAWING APPEARS TO BE WVHENL SEPARATELY374 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION VIEWED BY THAT EYE WHICH IS DIRECTED TOWARDS IT THE OBSERVER WILL PERCEIVE A FIGURE OF THREE DIMENSIONS THE EXACT COUNTERPART OF THE OBJECT FROM WHICH THE DRAWINGS WERE MADE TO NAKE THIS MATTER CLEAR I WILL MENTION ONE OR TWO OF THE MOST SIMPLE CASES IF TWO VERTICAL LINES NEAR EACH OTHER BUT AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE SPECTATOR BE REGARDED FIRST WITH ONE EYE AND THEN WITH THE OTHER THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THEM WHEN REFERRED TO THE SAME PLANE WILL APPEAR DIFFERENT IF THE LEFT HAND LINE BE NEARER TO THE EYES THE DISTANCE AS SEEN BY THE LEFT EYE WILL BE LESS THAN THE DISTANCE AS SEEN BY THE RIGHT EYE FIG 7 WILL RENDER THIS EVIDENT A A ARE VERTICAL SECTIONS OF THE TWO ORIGINAL LINES AND B B THE PLANE TO WHICH THEIR PROJECTIONS ARE REFERRED NOW IF THE TWO LINES BE DRAWN ON TWO PIECES OF CARD AT THE RESPECTIVE DISTANCES AT WHICH THEY APPEAR TO EACH EYE AND THESE CARDS BE AFTERWARDS VIEWED BY EITHER OF THE MEANS ABOVE DIRECTED THE OBSERVER WILL NO LONGER SEE TWO LINES ON A PLANE SURFACE AS EACH CARD SEPARATELY SHOWS BUT TWO LINES WILL APPEAR ONE NEARER TO HIM THAN THE OTHER PRE CISELY AS THE ORIGINAL VERTICAL LINES THEMSELVES AGAIN IF A STRAIGHT WIRE BE HELD BE FORE THE EYES IN SUCH A POSITION THAT ONE OF ITS ENDS SHALL BE NEARER TO THE LOBSERVER THAN THE OTHER IS EACH EYE SEPARATELY REFERRING IT TO A PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE COMMON AXIS WVILL SEE A LINE DIFFERENTLY INCLINED AND THEN IF LINES HAVING THE SAME APPARENT INCLINATIONS BE DRAWN ON TWO PIECES OF CARD AND BE PRESENTED TO THE EYES AS BEFORE DIRECTED THE REAL POSITION OF THE ORIGINAL LINE WILL BE CORRECTLY PERCEIVED BY THE MIND IN THE SAME MANNER THE MOST COMPLEX FIGURES OF THREE DIMENSIONS MAY BE ACCU RATELY REPRESENTED TO THE MIND BY PRESENTING THEIR TWO PERSPECTIVE PROJECTIONS TO THE TWO RETINAS BUT I SHALL DEFER THESE MORE PERFECT EXPERIMENTS UNTIL I DESCRIBE AN IN STRUMENT WHICH WILL ENABLE ANY PERSON TO OBSERVE ALL THE PHENOMENA IN QUESTION WITH THE GREATEST EASE AND CERTAINTY IN THE INSTRUMENTS ABOVE DESCRIBERD THE OPTIC AXES CONVERGE TO SOME POINT IN A PLANE BEFORE OR BEYOND THAT IN WHICH THE OBJECTS TO BE SEEN ARE SITUATED THE ADAPT ATION OF THE EVE WHICH ENABLES US TO SEE DISTINCTLY AT DIFFIERENT DISTANCES AND WHICH HABITUALLY ACCOMPANIES EVERY DIFFERENT DEGREE OF CONVERGENCE OF THE OPTIC AXES DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY ADJUST ITSELF TO THE NEW AND UNUSUAL CONDITION AND TO PERSONS NOT ACCUSTOMED TO EXPERIMENTS OF THIS KIND THE PICTURES WILL EITHER NOT READILY UNITE OR WILL APPEAR DIMN AND CONFUSED BESIDES THIS NO OBJECT CAN BE VIEWED ACCORDING TO EITHER TIODLE WHEN THE DRAWINGS EXCEED IN BREADTH THE DISTANCE OF THE TWO POINTS OF THE OPTIC AXES IN WHICH THEIR CENTRES ARE PLACED T11ESE INCONVENIENCES ARE REMOVED BY THE INSTRUMENT I AM ABOUT TO DESCRIBE THE TWO PICTURES OR RATHER THEIR REFLECTED IMAGES ARE PLACED IN IT AT THE TRUE CONCOURSE OF THE OPTIC AXES THE FOCAL ADAPTATION OF THE EYE PRESERVES ITS USUAL ADJUSTMENT THE APPEARANCE OF LATERAL IMAGES IS ENTIRELY AVOIDED AND A LARGE FIELD OF VIEW FOR EACH EYE IS OBTAINED THE FREQUENT REFERENCE I SHALL HAVE OCCASION TO MAKE TO THIS INSTRUMENT WILL RENDER IT CONVENIENT TO GIVE IT A SPECIFIC NAME I THEREFORE PROPOSE THAT IT BE CALLED A STEREOSCOPE TO INDICATE ITS PROPERTY OF REPRESENTING SOLID FIGURESMR WHEATSTONE ON TUIE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 375  3 THE STEREOSCOPE IS REPRESENTED BY FIGS 8 AND 9 THE FORMER BEING A FRONT VIEW AND THE LATTER A PLAN OF THE INSTRUMENT A A ARE TWO PLANE MIRRORS ABOUT FOUL INCHES SQUARE INSERTED IN FRAMES AND SO ADJUSTED THAT THEIR BACKS FORM AN ANGLE OF 900 WITH EACH OTHER THESE MIRRORS ARE FIXED BY THEIR COMMON EDGE AGAINST AN UP RIGHT B OR WHICH WAS LESS EASY TO REPRESENT IN THE DRAWING AGAINST THE MIDDLE LINE OF A VERTICAL BOARD CUT AWAY IN SUCH MANNER AS TO ALLOW THE EYES TO BE PLACED BEFORE THE TWO MIRRORS C C ARE TWO SLIDING BOARDS TO WHICH ARE ATTACHED THE UPRIGHT BOARDS D D WHICH MAY THUS BE REMOVED TO DIFFERENT DISTANCES FIROM THE MIRRORS IN MOST OF THE EXPERIMENTS HEREAFTER TO BE DETAILED IT IS NECESSARY THAT EACH UPRIGHT BOARD SHALL BE AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE MIRROR WHICH IS OPPOSITE TO IT TO FACI LITATE THIS DOUBLE ADJUSTMENT I EMPLOY A RIGHT AND A LEFTHANDED WOODEN SCREW R 1 THE TWO ENDS OF THIS COMPOUND SCREW PASS THROUGH THE NUTS E E WHICH ARE FIXED TO THE LOWER PARTS OF THE UPRIGHT BOARDS D D SO THAT BY TURNING THE SCREW PIN P ONE RVAY THE TWO BOARDS WILL APPROACH AND BY TURNIDG IT THE OTHER THEY WILL RECEDE FROM EACH OTHER ONE ALWAYS PRESERVING THE SAME DISTANCE AS THE OTHER FROM THE MIDDLE LINEF E E ARE PANNELS TO WHICH THE PICTURES ARE FIXED IN SUCH MANNER THAT THEIR CORRESPONDING HORIZONTAL LINES SHALL BE ON THE SAME LEVEL THESE PANNELS ARE CAPABLE OF SLIDING BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN GROOVES ON THE UPRIGHT BOARDS D D THE AP PARATUS HAVING BEEN DESCRIBED IT NOWV REMAINS TO EXPLAIN THE MANNER OF USING IT THE OBSERVER MUST PLACE HIS EYES AS NEAR AS POSSIBLE TO THE MIRRORS THE RIGHT EYE BEFORE THE RIGHT HAND MIRROR AND THE LEFT EYE BEFORE THE LEFT HAND MIRROR AND HE MUST MOVE THE SLIDING PANNELS E E TO OR FROM HIM UNTIL THE TWO REFLECTED IMAGES COINCIDE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES AND FORM AN IMAGE OF THE SAME APPARENT MAGNITUDE AS EACH OF THE COMPONENT PICTURES THE PICTURES WILL INDEED COINCIDE WHEN THE SLIDING PANNELS ARE IN A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT POSITIONS AND CONSEQUENTLY WHEN VIEWED UNDER DIFFERENT INCLINATIONS OF THE OPTIC AXES BUT THERE IS ONLY ONE POSITION IN WHICH THE BINOCULAR IMAGE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY SEEN SINGLE OF ITS PROPER MAGNITUDE AND WITHOUT FATIGUE TO THE EYES BECAUSE IN THIS POSITION ONLY THE ORDINARY RELATIONS BETWEEN THE MAGNITUDE OF THE PICTURES ON THE RETINA THE INCLINATION OF THE OPTIC AXES AND THE ADAPTATION OF THE EYE TO DISTINCT VISION AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES ARE PRESERVED THE AL TERATION IN THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF THE BINOCULAR IMAGES WHEN THESE USUAL RELATIONS ARE DISTURBED WILL BE DISCUSSED IN ANOTHER PAPER OF THIS SERIES WITH A VARIETY OF RE INARKABLE PHENOMENA DEPENDING THEREON IN ALL THE EXPERIMENTS DETAILED IN THE PRE SENT MEMOIR I SHALL SUPPOSE THESE RELATIONS TO REMAIN UNDISTURBED AND THE OPTIC AXES TO CONVERGE ABOUT SIX OR EIGHT INCHES BEFORE THE EYES IF THE PICTURES ARE ALL DRAWN TO BE SEEN WITH THE SAME INCLINATION OF THE OPTIC AXES THE APPARATUS MAY BE SIMPLIFIED BY OMITTING THE SCREW R I AND FIXING THE UPRIGHT BOARDS D D AT THE PROPER DISTANCES THE SLIDING PANNELS MAY ALSO BE DISPENSED WITH AND THE DRAWINGS THEMSELVES BE MADE TO SLIDE IN THE GROOVES376 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION  4 A FEW PAIRS OF OUTLINE FIGURES CALCULATED TO GIVE RISE TO THE PERCEPTION OF OBJECTS OF THREE DIMENSIONS WHEN PLACED IN THE STEREOSCOPE IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED ARE REPRE SENTED FROM FIGS 10 TO 20 THEY ARE ONE HALF THE LINEAR SIZE OF THE FIGURES ACTUALLY EM PLOYED AS THE DRAWINGS ARE REVERSED BY REFLECTION IN THE MIRRORS I WILL SUPPOSE THESE FIGURES TO BE THE REFLECTED IMAGES TO WHICH THE EYES ARE DIRECTED IN THE APPA RATUS THOSE MARKED B BEING SEEN BY THE RIGHT EYE AND THOSE MARKED A BY THE LEFT EYE THE DRAWINGS IT HAS BEEN ALREADY EXPLAINED ARE TWO DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS OF THE SAME OBJECT SEEN FROM TWO POINTS OF SIGHT THE DISTANCE BETWEEN WHICH IS EQUAL TO THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE EYES OF THE OBSERVER THIS INTERVAL IS GENERALLY ABOUT 22 INCHES A AND B FIG 10 WILL WHEN VIEWED IN THE STEREOSCOPE PRESENT TO THE MIND A LINE IN THE VERTICAL PLANE WITH ITS LOWER END INCLINED TOWARDS THE OBSERVER IF THE TWO COMPONENT LINES BE CAUSED TO TURN ROUND THEIR CENTRES EQUALLY IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS THE RESULTANT LINE WILL WHILE IT APPEARS TO ASSUME EVERY DEGREE OF INCLINATION TO THE REFERENT PLANE STILL SEEM TO REMAIN IN THE SAME VERTICAL PLANE FIG 1 1 A SERIES OF POINTS ALL IN THE SAME HORIZONTAL PLANE BUT EACH TOWARDS THE RIGHT HAND SUCCESSIVELY NEARER THE OBSERVER FIG 12 A CURVED LINE INTERSECTING THE REFERENT PLANE AND HAVING ITS CON VEXITY TOWARDS THE OBSERVER FIG 13 A CUBE FIG 14 A CONE HAVING ITS AXIS PERPENDICULAR TO THE REFERENT PLANE AND ITS VERTEX TOWARDS THE OBSERVER FIG 15 THE FRUSTUM OF A SQUARE PYRAMID ITS AXIS PERPENDICULAR TO THE REFERENT PLANE AN D ITS BASE FURTHEST FROM THE EYE FIG 16 TWO CIRCLES AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FROM THE EYES THEIR CENTRES IN THE SAME PERPENDICULAR FORMING THE OUTLINE OF THE FRUSTUM OF A CONE THE OTHER FIGURES REQUIRE NO OBSERVATION FOR THE PURPOSES OF ILLUSTRATION I HAVE EMPLOYED ONLY OUTLINE FIGURES FOR HAD EITHER SHADING OR COLOURING BEEN INTRODUCED IT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE EFFECT WAS WHOLLY OR IN PART DUE TO THESE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEREAS BY LEAVING THEM OUT OF CONSIDERATION NO ROOM IS LEFT TO DOUBT THAT THE ENTIRE EFFECT OF RELIEF IS OWING TO THE SIMULTANEOUS PERCEPTION OF THE TWO MONOCULAR PROJECTIONS ONE ON EACH RETINA BUT IF IT BE RE QUIRED TO OBTAIN THE MOST FAITHFUL RESEMBLANCES OF REAL OBJECTS SHADOWING AND CO LOURING MAY PROPERLY BE EMPLOYED TO HEIGHTEN THE EFFECTS CAREFUL ATTENTION WOULD ENABLE AN ARTIST TO DRAW AND PAINT THE TWO COMPONENT PICTURES SO AS TO PRESENT TO THE MIND OF THE OBSERVER IN THE RESULTANT PERCEPTION PERFECT IDENTITY WITH THE OBJECT RE PRESENTED FLOWERS CRYSTALS BUSTS VASES INSTRUMENTS OF VARIOUS KINDS C MIGHT THUS BE REPRESENTED SO AS NOT TO BE DISTINGUISHED BY SIGHT FROM THE REAL OBJECTS THEM SELVESMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 377 IT IS WORTHY OF REMIARK THAT THE PROCESS BY WHICH WE THUS BECOME ACQUAINTED WITH THE REAL FORMS OF SOLID OBJECTS IS PRECISELY THAT WHICH IS EMPLOYED IN DESCRIPTIVE GEO METRY AN IMPORTANT SCIENCE WE OWE TO THE GELLIUS OF MONGE BUT WHICH IS LITTLE STUDIED OR KNOWN IN THIS COUNTRY IN THIS SCIENCE THE POSITION OF A POINT A RIGHT LINE OR A CURVE AND CONSEQUENTLY OF ANY FIGURE WHATEVER IS COMPLETELY DETERMINED BY AS SIGNING ITS PROJECTIONS ON TWO FIXED PLANES THE SITUATIONS OF WHICH ARE KNOWN AND WHICH ARE NOT PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER IN THE PROBLEMS OF DESCRIPTIVE GEOMETRY THE TWO REFERENT PLANES ARE GENERALLY ASSUMED TO BE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO EACH OTHER BUT IN BINOCULAR VISION THE INCLINATION OF THESE PLANES IS LESS ACCORDING AS THE ANGLE MADE AT THE CONCOURSE OF THE OPTIC AXES IS LESS THUS THE SAMNE SOLID OBJECT IS REPRESENTED TO THE MIND BY DIFFERENT PAIRS OF TRONOCULAR PICTURES ACCORDING AS THEY ARE PLACED AT A DIFFERENT DISTANCE BEFORE THE EYES AND THE PERCEPTION OF THESE DLIFFERENCES THOUGH WE SEEM TO BE UNCONSCIOUS OF THEM MAY ASSIST IN SUGGESTING TO THE RMIND THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT THE MORE INCLINED TO EACH OTHER THE REFERENT PLANES ARE WITH THE GREATER ACCURACY ARE THE VARIOUS POINTS OF THE PROJECTIONS REFERRED TO THEIR PROPER PLACES AND IT APPEARS TO BE A USEFUL PROVISION THAT THE REAL FORMAS OF THOSE OBJECTS WHICH ARE NEAREST TO U1S ARE THUS MORE DLETELRMINATELY APPREHLENDLED THAN THOSE WHLICH ARE MORE DISTANT 4 5 A VERY SINGULAR EFFECT IS PRODUCED WHEN THE DRAWING ORIGINALLY INTENDED TO BE SEEN BY THE RIGHT EYE IS PLACED AT THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE STEREOSCOPE AND THAT DESIGNED TO BE SEEN BY THE LEFT EYE IS PLACED ON ITS RIGHT HAND SIDE A FIGURE OF THREE DIMEN SIONS AS BOLD IN RELIEF AS BEFORE IS PERCEIVED BUT IT HAS A DIFFERENT FORM FROM THAT WHICH IS SEEN WHEN THE DRAWINGS ARE IN THEIR PROPER PLACES THERE IS A CERTAIN RELA TION BETWEEN THE PROPER FIGURE AND THIS WHICH I SHALL CALL ITS CONVERSE FIGURE THOSE POINTS WHICH ARE NEAREST THE OBSERVER IN THE PROPER FIGURE ARE THE MOST REMOTE FROM HIM IN THE CONVERSE FIGURE AND VICE VERSD SO THAT THE FIGURE IS AS IT WERE INVERTED BUT IT IS NOT AN EXACT INVERSION FOR THE NEAR PARTS OF THE CONVERSE FIGURE APPEAR SMALLER AND THE REMOTE PARTS LARGER THAN THE SAME PARTS BEFORE THE INVERSION HENCE THE DRAWINGS WHICH PROPERLY PLACED OCCASION A CUBE TO BE PERCEIVED WHEN CHANGED IN THE MANNER DESCRIBED REPRESENT THE FRUSTURM OF A SQUARE PYRAMID WITH ITS BASE REINOTE FROM THE EYE THE CAUSE OF THIS IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND THIS CONVERSION OF RELIEF MAY BE SHOWN BY ALL THE PAILS OF DRAWINGS FROM FIG 10 TO 19 IN THE CASE OF SIMPLE FIGURES LIKE THESE THE CONVERSE FIGURE IS AS READILY APPRE HENDED AS THE ORIGINAL ONE BECAUSE IT IS GENERALLY A FIGURE OF AS FREQUENT OCCURRENCE BUT IN THE CASE OF A MORE COINPLICATED FIGURE AN ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN FOR INSTANCE THE MIND UNACCUSTOMED TO PERCEIVE ITS CONVERSE BECAUSE IT NEVER OCCURS IN NATURE CAN FIND NO MEANING IN IT MNCCCXXXVLML 3 C378 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION  6 THE SAME IMAGE IS DEPICTED ON THE RETINA BY AN OBJECT OF THREE DIMENSIONS AS BY ITS PROJECTION ON A PLANE SURFACE PROVIDED THE POINT OF SIGHT REMAIN IN BOTH CASES THE SAME THERE SHOULD BE THEREFORE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE BINOCULAR APPEARANCE OF TWO DRAWINGS ONE PRESENTED TO EACH EYE AND OF TWO REAL OBJECTS SO PRESENTED TO THE TWO EYES THAT THEIR PROJECTIONS ON THE RETINA SHALL BE THE SAME AS THOSE ARISING FROM THE DRAWINGS THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS WILL PROVE THE JUSTNESS OF THIS INFERENCE I PROCURED SEVERAL PAIRS OF SKELETON FIGURES I E OUTLINE FIGURES OF THREE DIMENSIONS FORMED EITHER OF IRON WIRE OR OF EBONY BEADING ABOUT ONE TENTH OF AN INCH IN THICK NESS THE PAIR I MOST FREQUENTLY EMPLOYED CONSISTED OF TWO CUBES WHOSE SIDES WERE THREE INCHES IN LENGTH WHEN I PLACED THESE SKELETON FIGURES ON STANDS BEFORE THE TWO MIRRORS OF THE STEREOSCOPE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS WERE PRODUCED ACCORDING AS THEIR RELATIVE POSITIONS WERE CHANGED 1 ST WHEN THEY WERE SO PLACED THAT THE PICTURES WHICH THEIR REFLECTED IMAGES PROJECTED ON THE TWO RETINU WERE PRECISELY THE SAME AS THOSE WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN PROJECTED BY A CUBE PLACED AT THE CONCOURSE OF THE OPTIC AXES A CUBE IN RELIEF APPEARED BEFORE THE EYES 2NDLY WHEN THEY WERE SO PLACED THAT THEIR REFLECTED IMAGES PROJECTED EXACTLY SIMILAR PICTURES ON THE TWO RETINTE ALL EFFECT OF RELIEF WAS DESTROYED AND THE COMPOUND APPEARANCE WAS THAT OF AN OUT LINE REPRESENTATION ON A PLANE SURFACE 3RDLY WHEN THE CUBES WERE SO PLACED THAT THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF ONE PROJECTED ON THE LEFT RETINA THE SAME PICTURE AS IN THE FIRST CASE WAS PROJECTED ON THE RIGHT RETINA AND CONVERSELY THE CONVERSE FIGURE IN RELIEF APPEARED 7 IF A SYMMETRICAL OBJECT THAT IS ONE WHOSE RIGHT AND LEFT SIDES ARE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER BUT INVERTED BE PLACED SO THAT ANY POINT IN THE PLANE WHICH DIVIDES IT INTO THESE TWO HALVES IS EQUALLY DISTANT FROM THE TWO EYES ITS TWO MONOCULAR PROJECTIONS ARE IT IS EASY TO SEE INVERTED FACSINILES OF EACH OTHER THUS FIG 15 A AND B ARE SYM METRICAL MONOCULAR PROJECTIONS OF THE FRUSTUM OF A FOURSIDED PYRAMID AND FIGS 13 14 16 ARE CORRESPONDING PROJECTIONS OF OTHER SYMMETRICAL OBJECTS THIS BEING KEPT IN VIEW I WILL DESCRIBE AN EXPERIMENT WHICH HAD IT BEEN CASUALLY OBSERVED PREVIOUS TO THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRINCIPLES DEVELOPED IN THIS PAPER WOULD HAVE APPEARED AN INEXPLICABLE OPTICAL ILLUSION M AND M FIG 21 ARE TWO MIRRORS INCLINED SO THAT THEIR FACES FORM AN ANGLE OF 90 WITH EACH OTHER BETWEEN THEM IN THE BISECTING PLANE IS PLACED A PLANE OUTLINE FIGURE SUCH AS FIG 15 A MADE OF CARD ALL PARTS BUT THE LINES BEING CUT AWAY OR OF WIRE A REFLECTED IMAGE OF THIS OUTLINE PLACED AT A WILL APPEAR BEHIND EACH MIRROR AT B AND B AND ONE OF THESE IMAGES WILL BE THE INVERSION OF THE OTHER IF THE EYES BE MADE TO CONVERGE AT C IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THESE TWO REFLECTED IMAGES WILL FALL ON CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE TWO RETINAE AND A FIGURE OF THREE DIMENSIONS WILL BE PER CEIVED  IF THE OUTLINE PLACED IN THE BISECTING PLANE BE REVERSED THE CONVERSE SKELETONMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 379 FORM WVILL APPEAR IN BOTH THESE EXPERIMENTS WE HAVE THE SINGULAR PHENOMENON OF THE CONVERSION OF A SINGLE PLANE OUTLINE INTO A FIGURE OF THREE DIMENSIONS TO RENDER THE BINOCULAR OBJECT MORE DISTINCT CONCAVE LENSES MAY BE APPLIED TO THE EYES AND TO PREVENT THE TWO LATERAL IMAGES FROM BEING SEEN SCREENS MAY BE PLACED AT D AND D  S AN EFFECT OF BINOCULAR PERSPECTIVE MAY BE REMARKED IN A PLATE OF METAL THE SURFACE OF WHICH HAS BEEN MADE SMOOTH BY TURNING IT IN A LATHE WHEN A SINGLE CANDLE IS BROUGHT NEAR SUCH A PLATE A LINE OF LIGHT APPEARS STANDING OUT FROM IT ONE HALF BEING ABOVE AND THE OTHER HALF BELOW THE SURFACE THE POSITION AND INCLINATION OF THIS LINE CHANGES WITH THE SITUATION OF THE LIGHT AND OF THE OBSERVER BUT IT ALWAYS PASSES THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE PLATE ON CLOSING THE LEFT EYE THE RELIEF DISAPPEARS AND THE LUMINOUS LINE COINCIDES WITH ONE OF THE DIAMETERS OF THE PLATE OIL CLOSING THE RIGHT EYE THE LINE APPEARS EQUALLY IN THE PLANE OF THE SURFACE BUT COINCIDES WITH ANOTHER DIAMETER ON OPENING BOTH EYES IT INSTANTLY STARTS INTO RELIEF THE CASE HERE IS EX ACTLY ANALOGOUS TO THE VISION OF TWO INCLINED LINES FIG 10 WHEN EACH IS PRESENTED TO A DIFFERENT EYE IN THE STEREOSCOPE IT IS CURIOUS THAT AN EFFECT LIKE THIS WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN SEEN THOUSANDS OF TIMES SHOULD NEVER HAVE ATTRACTED SUFFICIENT AT TENTION TO HAVE BEEN MADE THE SUBJECT OF PHILOSOPHIC OBSERVATION IT WAS ONE OF THE EARLIEST FACTS WHICH DREW MY ATTENTION TO THE SUBJECT I AM NOW TREATING DR SMITHT WAS VERY MUCH PUZZLED BY AN EFFECT OF BINOCULAR PERSPECTIVE WHICH HIE OBSERVED HUT WAS UNABLE TO EXPLAIN HE OPENED A PAIR OF COMPASSES AND WHILE HE HELD THE JOINT IN HIS HAND AND THE POINTS OUTWARDS AND EQUIDISTANT FROM HIS EYES AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER THAN THE JOINT HE LOOKED AT A MORE DISTANT POINT THE CORN PASSES APPEARED DOUBLE HE THEN COMPRESSED THE LEGS UNTIL THE TWO INNER POINTS CO INCIDED HAVING DONE THIS THE TWO INNER LEGS ALSO ENTIRELY COINCIDED AND BISECTED THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE OUTWARD ONES APPEARING LONGER AND THICKER THAN THEY DID AND REACHING FROM THE HAND TO THE REMOTEST OBJECT IN VIEW THE EXPLANATION OFFERED BY DR SMITH ACCOUNTS ONLY FOR THE COINCIDENCE OF THE POINTS OF THE COMPASSES NOT FOR THAT OF THE ENTIRE LEG THE EFFECT IN QUESTION IS BEST SEEN BY EMPLOYING A PAIR OF STRAIGHT WIRES ABOUT A FOOT IN LENGTH A SIMILAR OBSERVATION MADE WITH TWO FLAT RULERS AND AFTERWARDS WITH SILK THREADS INDUCED DR WELLS TO PROPOSE A NEW THEORY OF VISIBLE DIRECTION IN ORDER TO EXPLAIN IT SO INEXPLICABLE DID IT SEEM TO HIM BY ANY OF THE RECEIVED THEORIES  THE LUMINOUS LINE SEEN BY A SINGLE EYE ARISES FROM THE REFLECTION OF THE LIGHT FROM EACH OF THE CONCENTRIC CIRCLES PRODUCED IN THE OPERATION OF TURNING WHEN THE PLATE IS NOT LARGE THE ARRANGEMENT OF THESE SUCCESSIVE REFLECTIONS DOES NOT DIFFER FROM A STRAIGHT LINE T SYSTEM OF OPTICS VOL II P 388 AND R 526 3 C 2380 AEMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION  9 THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS RENDER IT EVIDENT THAT THERE IS AN ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE IN THE APPEARANCE OF OBJECTS WHEN SEEN WITH TWO EYES AND WHEN ONLY ONE EYE IS EM PLOYED AND THAT THE MOST VIVID BELIEF OF THE SOLIDITY OF AN OBJECT OF THREE DIMENSIONS ARISES FROM TWO DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE PROJECTIONS OF IT BEING SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENTED TO THE MIND ILOW HAPPENS IT THEN IT MAY BE ASKED THAT PERSONS WHO SEE WITH ONLY ONE EYE FORIN CORRECT NOTIONS OF SOLID OBJECTS AND NEVER MISTAKE THEM FOR PICTURES  AND HOW HAPPENS IT ALSO THAT A PERSON HAVING THE PERFECT USE OF BOTH EYES PERCEIVES NO DIFFERENCE IN OBJECTS AROUND HIM WHEN HE SHUTS ONE OF THEM  TO EXPLAIN THESE APPARENT DIFFICULTIES IT MUST LIE KEPT IN MIND THAT ALTHOUGH THE SIMULTANEOUS VISION OF TWO DISSIMILAR PICTURES SUGGESTS THE RELIEF OF OBJECTS IN THE MOST VIVID MRANNER YET THERE ARE OTHER SIGNS WHICH SUGGEST THE SAME IDEAS TO THE MINDU WHICH THOUGH MORE AMBIGUOUS THAN THE FORMER BECOME LESS LIABLE TO LEAD THE JUDGMENT CASTRAY IN PRO PORTION TO THE EXTENT OF OUR PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE TRLE VIVIDNESS OF RELIEF ARISING FIOMY THE PROJECTION OF TWO LISSIMILAR PICTURES ONE ON EACH RETINA BECOMES LESS AND LESS AS THE OBJECT IS SEEN AT A GREATER DISTANCE BEFORE THE EYES AND ENTIRELY CEASES WHEN IT IS SO DISTANT THAT THE OPTIC AXES ARE PARALLEL WHILE REGARDING IT WE SEE WITH BOTH EYES ALL OBJECTS BEYOND THIS DISTANCE PRECISELY AS WE SEE NEAR OBJECTS WITH A SINGLE EYE FOR THE PICTURES ON THE TWO RETINVE ARE THEN EXACTLY SIMILAR AND THE MIND APPRECIATES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER TWO IDENTICAL PICTURES FALL ON CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE TWO RETING OR WHETHER ONE EYE IS IMPRESSED WITH ONLY ONE OF THESE PICTURES A PERSON DEPRIVED OF THE SIGHT OF ONE EYE SEES THEREFORE ALL EXTERNAL OBJECTS NEAR AND REMOTE AS A PERSON WITH BOTH EYES SEES REMOTE OBJECTS ONLY BUT THAT VIVID EFFECT ARISING FROM THE BINOCULAR VISION OF NEAR OBJECTS IS NOT PERCEIVED LY THE FORMER TO SUPPLY THIS DEFICIENCY HE HAS RECOURSE UNCONSCIOUSLY TO OTHER MEANS OF ACQUIRING MORE ACCURATE INFORMATION THE MOTION OF THE HEAD IS THE PRINCIPAL MEANS HE EMPLOYS TRLAT THE REQUIRED KNOWLEDGE MAY BE THUS OBTAINED WILL BE EVIDENT FROM THE FOLLOWING CONSI DERATIONS THE MIND ASSOCIATES WITH THE IDEA OF A SOLID OBJECT EVERY DIFFERENT PROJEC TION OF IT WHICH EXPERIENCE HAS HITHERTO AFFORDED A SINGLE PROJECTION MAY BE AMNBI GUOUS FROM ITS BEING ALSO ONE OF THE PROJECTIONS OF A PICTURE OR OF A DIFFERENT SOLID OBJECT BUT WHEN DIFFERENT PROJECTIONS OF THE SAME OBJECT ARE SUCCESSIVELY PRESENTED THEY CANNOT ALL BELONG TO ANOTHER OBJECT AND THE FORMN TO WHICH THEY BELONG IS COM PLETELY CHARACTERIZED WHILE THE OBJECT REMNAINS FIXED AT EVERY MOVEMENT OF THE HEAD IT IS VIEWED FROM A DIFFERENT POINT OF SIGHT AND THE PICTURE ON THE RETINA CONSE QUENTLY CONTINUALLY CHANGES EVERY ONE MUST BE AWARE HOW GREATLY THE PERSPECTIVE EFFECT OF A PICTURE IS ENHANCED BY LOOKING AT IT WITH ONLY ONE EYE ESPECIALLY WHEN A TUBE IS EMPLOYED TO EXCLUDE THE VISION OF ADJACENT OBJECTS WHOSE PRESENCE MIGHT DISTURB THE ILLUSION SEEN UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES FROMN THE PROPER POINT OF SIGHT THE PICTURE PROJECTS THE SAMNE LINES SHADES AND COLOURS ON THE RETINA AS THE MORE DISTANT SCENE WHICH IT REPRESENTSMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 381 WOULD DO WERE IT SUBSTITUTED FOR IT THE APPEARANCE WHICH WOULD MAKE US CERTAIN THAT IT IS A PICTURE IS EXCLUDED FROM THE SIGHT AND THE IMAGINATION HAS ROOM TO BE ACTIVE SEVERAL OF THE OLDER WRITERS ERRONEOUSLY ATTRIBUTED THIS APPARENT SUPERIORITY OF MONOCULAR VISION TO THE CONCENTRATION OF THE VISUAL POWER IN A SINGLE EYE  THERE IS A WELLKNOWN AND VERY STRIKING ILLUSION OF PERSPECTIVE WHICH DESERVES A PASSING REMARK BECAUSE THE REASON OF THE EFFECT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GENERALLY UN DERSTOOD WHEN A PERSPECTIVE OF A BUILDING IS PROJECTED ON A HORIZONTAL PLANE SO THAT THE POINT OF SIGHT IS IN A LINE GREATLY INCLINE D TOWARDS THE PLANE THE BUILDING AP PEARS TO A SINGLE EYE PLACED AT THE POINT OF SIMHT TO BE IN BOLD RELIEF AND THE ILLUSION IS ALMOST AS PERFECT AS IN THE BINOCULAR EXPERIMENTS DESCRIBED IN T 2 3 4 THIS EFFECT WHOLLY ARISES FROM THE UNUSUAL PROJECTION WHICH SUGGESTS TO THE MIND MORE READILY THE OBJECT ITSELF THAN THE DRAWING OF IT FOR WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SEE REAL OBJECTS IN ALMOST EVERY POINT OF VIEW BUT PERSPECTIVE REPRESENTATIONS BEING GENERALLY NADE IN A VERTICAL PLANE WITH THE POINT OF SIGHT IN A LINE PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANE OF PROJECTION WE ARE LESS FAMILIAR WITH THE APPEARANCE OF OTHER PROJECTIONS ANY OTHER UNUSUAL PROJECTION WILL PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT 10 IF WE LOOK WITH A SINGLE EYE AT THE DRAWING OF A SOLID GEOMETRICAL FIGURE IT MAY BE IMAGINED TO BE THE REPRESENTATION OF EITHER OF TWO DISSIMILAR SOLID FIGURES THE FIGURE INTENDED TO BE REPRESENTED OR ITS CONVERSE FIGURE  5 IF THE FORMER IS A VERY USUAL AND THE LATTER A VERY UNUSUAL FIGURE THE IMAGINATION WILL FIX ITSELF ON THE ORIGINAL WITHOUT WANDERING TO THE CONVERSE FIGURE BUT IF BOTH ARE OF ORDINARY OCCURRENCE WHICH IS GENERALLY THE CASE WITH REGARD TO SIMPLE FORMS A SINGULAR PHENOMENON TAKES PLACE IT IS PERCEIVED AT ONE TIME DISTINCTLY AS ONE OF THESE FIGURES AT ANOTHER TIME AS THE OTHER AND WHILE ONE FIGURE CONTINUES IT IS NOT IN THE POWER OF THE WILL TO CHANGE IT IMMEDIATELY THE SAME PHENOMENON TAKES PLACE THOUGH LESS DECIDEDLY WHEN THE DRAWING IS SEEN WITH BOTH EYES MANY OF MY READERS WILL CALL TO MIND THE PUZZLING EFFECT OF SOME OF THE DIAGRAMS ANNEXED TO THE PROBLEMS OF THE ELEVENTH BOOK OF EUCLID WHICH WHEN THEY WERE ATTENTIVELY LOOKED AT CHANGED IN AN ARBITRARY MANNER FROM ONE SOLID FIGURE TO ANOTHER AND WOULD OBSTINATELY CONTINUE TO PRESENT THE CONVERSE FIGURES WHEN THE REAL FIGURES ALONE WERE WANTED THIS PERPLEXING ILLUSION MUST BE OF COMN MON OCCURRENCE BUT I HAVE ONLY FOUND ONE RECORDED OBSERVATION RELATING TO THE SUB JECT IT IS BY PROFESSOR NECKER OF GENEVA AND I SHALL QUOTE IT IN HIS OWN WORDS FROM THE PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE THIRD SERIES VOL I P 337 THE OBJECT I HAVE NOW TO CALL YOUR ATTENTION TO IS AN OBSERVATION WHICH HAS OFTEN  C WE SEE MORE EXQUISITELY WITH ONE EYE SHUT THAN WITH BOTH BECAUSE THE VITAL SPIRITS THUS UNITE THEM SELVES THE MORE AND BECOME THE STRONGER FOR WE MAY FIND BY LOOKING IN A CLASS WHILST WE SHUT ONE EYE THAT THE PUPIL OF THE OTHER DILATESLORD BACONS WORKS SYLVA SYLVARUMN ART VISION382 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION OCCURRED TO ME WHILE EXAMINING FIGURES AND ENGRAVED PLATES OF CRYSTALLINE FORMS I MEAN A SUDDEN AND INVOLUNTARY CHANGE IN THE APPARENT POSITION OF A CRYSTAL OR SOLID REPRESENTED IN AN ENGRAVED FIGURE WHAT I MEAN WVILL BE MORE EASILY UNDERSTOOD FROM THE FIGURE ANNEXED FIG 22 THE RHOMBOID A X IS DRAWN SO THAT THE SOLID ANGLE A SHOULD BE SEEN THE NEAREST TO THE SPECTATOR AND THE SOLID ANGLE X THE FARTHEST FROM HIM AND THAT THE FACE A C D B SHOULD BE THE FOREMOST WHILE THE FACE X D C IS BE HIND BUT IN LOOKING REPEATEDLY AT THE SAME FIGURE YOU WILL PERCEIVE THAT AT TIMES THE APPARENT POSITION OF THE RHOMBOID IS SO CHANGED THAT THE SOLID ANGLE X WILL AP PEAR THE NEAREST AND THE SOLID ANGLE A THE FARTHEST AND THAT THE FACE A C D B WILL RECEDE BEHIND THE FACE X D C WHICH WILL COME FORWARD WHICH EFFECT GIVES TO THE WHOLE SOLID A QUITE CONTRARY APPARENT INCLINATION PROFESSOR NECKER ATTRIBUTES THIS ALTERATION OF APPEARANCE NOT TO A MENTAL OPERA TION BUT TO AN INVOLUNTARY CHANGE IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF THE EYE FOR OBTAINING DISTINCT VISION IHE SUPPOSED THAT WHENEVER THE POINT OF DISTINCT VISION ON THE RETINA IS DI RECTED ON THE ANGLE A FOR INSTANCE THIS ANGLE SEEN MORE DISTINCTLY THAN THE OTHERS IS NATURALLY SUPPOSED TO BE NEARER AND FOREMOST WHILE THE OTHER ANGLES SEEN INDISTINCTLY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FARTHER AND BEHIND AND THAT THE REVERSE TAKES PLACE WHEN THE POINT OF DISTINCT VISION IS BROUGHT TO BEAR ON THE ANGLE X THAT THIS IS NOT THE TRUE EXPLANATION IS EVIDENT FROM THREE CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE FIRST PLACE THE TWO POINTS A AND X BEING BOTH AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE EYES THE SAME ALTERATION OF ADJUSTMENT WHICH WOULD MAKE ONE OF THEM INDISTINCT WOULD MAKE THE OTHER SO SECONDLY THE FIGURE WILL UNDERGO THE SAME CHANGES WHETHER THE FOCAL DISTANCE OF THE EYE BE ADJUSTED TO A POINT BEFORE OR BEYOND THE PLANE IN WHICH THE FIGURE IS DRAWN AND THIRDLY THE CHANGE OF FIGURE FREQUENTLY OCCURS WHILE THE EYE CONTINUES TO LOOK AT THE SAME ANGLE THE EFFECT SEEMS ENTIRELY TO DEPEND ON OUR MENTAL CON TEMPLATION OF THE FIGURE INTENDED TO BE REPRESENTED OR OF ITS CONVERSE BY FOLLOWING THE LINES WITH THE EYE WITH A CLEAR IDEA OF THE SOLID FIGURE WE ARE DESCRIBING IT MAY BE FIXED FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME BUT IT REQUIRES PRACTICE TO DO THIS OR TO CHANGE THE FIGURE AT WILL AS I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THESE EFFECTS ARE FAR MORE OBVIOUS WHEN THE FIGURES ARE REGARDED WITH ONE EYE ONLY NO ILLUSION OF THIS KIND CAN TAKE PLACE WHEN AN OBJECT OF THREE DIMENSIONS IS SEEN XWITH BOTH EYES WHILE THE OPTIC AXES MAKE A SENSIBLE ANGLE WITH EACH OTHER BECAUSE THE APPEARANCE OF THE TWO DISSIMILAR IMAGES ONE TO EACH EYE PREVENTS THE POSSIBILITY OF MISTAKE BUT IF WE REGARD AN OBJECT AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT ITS TWO PROJECTIONS AARE SENSIBLY IDENTICAL AND IF THIS PROJECTION BE CAPABLE OF A DOUBLE INTERPRETATION THE ILLUSION MAY OCCUR THUS A PLACARD ON A POLE CARRIED IN THE STREETS WITH ONE OF ITS SIDES INCLINED TOWARDS THE OBSERVER WILL WHEN HE IS DISTANT FROM IT FREQUENTLY AP PEAR INCLINED IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION MANY ANALOGOUS INSTANCES MIGHT BE ADDUCED BUT THIS WILL SUFFICE TO CALL OTHERS TO MIND IT MUST HOWEVER BE OBSERVED THAT WHEN SHADOWS OR OTHER MEANS CAPABLE OF DETERMINING THE JUDGEMENT ARE PRESENT THESE FALLACIES DO NOT ARISEMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 383  11 THE SAME INDETERMINATION OF JUDGEMENT WHICH CAUSES A DRAWING TO BE PERCEIVED BY THE MIND AT DIFFERENT TIMES AS TWO DIFFERENT FIGURES FREQUENTLY GIVES RISE TO A FALSE PERCEPTION WHEN OBJECTS IN RELIEF ARE REGARDED WVITH A SINGLE EYE THE APPARENT CON VERSION OF A CAMEO INTO AN INTAGLIO AND OF AN INTAGLIO INTO A CAMEO IS A WELLKNOWN INSTANCE OF THIS FALLACY IN VISION BUT THE FACT DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME TO HAVE BEEN CORRECTLY EXPLAINED NOR THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT OCCURS TO HAVE BEEN PROPERLY STATED THIS CURIOUS ILLUSION WHICH HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF MUNCH ATTENTION WAS FIRST OB SERVED AT ONE OF THE EARLY MEETINGS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY SEVERAL OF THE MEMBERS LOOKING THROUGH A COMPOUND MICROSCOPE OF A NEW CONSTRUCTION AT A GUINEA SOME OF THEM IMAGINED THE IMAGE TO BE DEPRESSED WHILE OTHERS THOUGHT IT TO BE EMBOSSED AS IT REALLY WAS PROFESSOR GMELIN OF WURTEMBURG PUBLISHED A PAPER ON THE SAME SUBJECT IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1745 HIS EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE WITH TELESCOPES AND COMPOUND MICROSCOPES WHICH INVERTED THE IMAGES AND HE OBSERVED THAT THE CONVERSION OF RELIEF APPEARED IN SOME CASES AND NOT IN OTHERS AT SOME TIMES AND NOT AT OTHERS AND TO SOME EYES ALSO AND NOT TO OTHERS HE ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN SOME OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE TWO APPEARANCES  BUT WHY THESE THINGS SHOULD SO HAPPEN SAYS HE S I DO NOT PRETEND TO DETERMINE SIR DAVID BREWSTER ACCOUNTS FOR THE FALLACY IN THE FOLLOWING MNANNERT A HOLLOW SEAL BEING ILLUMINATED BY A WINDOW OR A CANDLE ITS SHADED SIDE IS OF COURSE ON THE SAME SIDE WITH THE LIGHT IF WE NOW INVERT THE SEAL WITH ONE OR MORE LENSES SO THAT IT MAY LOOK IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IT WILL APPEAR TO THE EYE WITH THE SHADED SIDE FURTHEST FROM THE WINDOW BUT AS WE KNOW THAT THE WINDOW IS STILL ON OUR LEFT HAND AND AS EVERY BODY WITH ITS SHADED SIDE FURTHEST FROM THE LIGHT MUST NECESSARILY BE CONVEX OR PROTUBERANT WE IMMEDIATELY BELIEVE THAT THE HOLLOW SEAL IS NOW A CAMEO OR BASRELIEF THE PROOF WHICH THE EYE THUS RECEIVES OF THE SEAL BEING RAISED OVER COMES THE EVIDENCE OF ITS BEING HOLLOW DERIVED FROM OUR ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND FROM THE SENSE OF TOUCH IN THIS EXPERIMENT THE DECEPTION TAKES PLACE FROM OUR KNOWING THE REAL DIRECTION OF THE LIGHT WHICH FALLS ON THE SEAL FOR IF THE PLACE OF THE WINDOW WITH RESPECT TO THE SEAL HAD BEEN INVERTED AS WELL AS THE SEAL ITSELF THE ILLUSION COULD NOT HAVE TAKEN PLACE THE ILLUSION THEREFORE UNDER OUR CONSIDERATION IS THE RESULT OF AN OPERATION OF OUR OWN MINDS WHEREBY WE JUDGE OF THE FORMS OF BODIES BY THE KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE ACQUIRED OF LIGHT AND SHADOW HENCE THE ILLUSION DEPENDS ON THE ACCURACY AND EXTENT OF OUR KNOWLEDGE ON THIS SUBJECT AND WHILE SOME PERSONS ARE UNDER ITS INFLUENCE OTHERS ARE ENTIRELY INSENSIBLE TO IT THESE CONSIDERATIONS DO NOT FULLY EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENON FOR THEY SUPPOSE THAT THE IMAGE MUST BE INVERTED AND THAT THE LIGHT MUST FALL IN A PARTICULAR DIRECTION BUT THE CONVERSION OF RELIEF WILL STILL TAKE PLACE WHEN THE OBJECT IS VIEWED THROUGH AN  BIRCUS HISTORY VOL II P 348 T NATURAL MAGIC P 100384 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION OPEN TUBE WITHOUT ANY LENSES TO INVERT IT AND ALSO WHEN IT IS EQUALLY ILLUMINATED IN ALL PARTS THE TRUE EXPLANATION I BELIEVE TO BE THE FOLLOWING IF WE SUPPOSE A CAMEO AND AN INTAGLIO OF THE SAME OBECT THE ELEVATIONS OF THE ONE CORRESPONDING EXACTLY TO THE DEPRESSIONS OF THE OTHER IT IS EASY TO SHOW THAT THE PROJECTION OF EITHER ON THE RETINA IS SENSIBLY THE SAME WHEN THE CAMEO OR THE INTAGLIO IS SEEN WITH BOTH EVES IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO MISTAKE AN ELEVATION FOR A DEPRESSION FOR REASONS WHICH HAVE BEEN ALREADY AMPLY EXPLAINED BUT WHEN EITHER IS SEEN WITH ONE EYE ONLY THE MOST CERTAIN GUIDE OF OUR JUDGEMENT VIZ THE PRESENTATION OF A DIFFERENT PICTURE TO EACH EYE IS WANTING THE IMAGINATION THEREFORE SUPPLIES THE DEFICIENCY AND WE CONCEIVE THE OB JECT TO BE RAISED OR DEPRESSED ACCORDING TO THE DICTATES OF THIS FACULTY NO DOUBT IN SUCH CASES OUR JUDGEMENT IS IN A GREAT DEGREE INFLUENCED BY ACCESSORY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE INTAGLIO OR THE RELIEF MNLAY SOMETIMES PRESENT ITSELF ACCORDING TO OUR PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE SHADOWS OUGHT TO APPEAR BUT THE REAL CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENON IS TO BE FOUND IN THE INDETERMINATION OF THE JUDGERNENT ARISING FROM OUR MORE PERFECT MEANS OF JUDGING BEING ABSENT OBSERVERS WITH THE MICROSCOPE MUST BE PARTICULARLY ON THEIR GUARD AGAINST ILLUSIONS OF THIS KIND RASPAIL OBSERVES THAT THE HOLLOW PYRAMIDAL ARRANGEMENT OF THE CRYSTALS OF MURIATE OF SODA APPEARS WHEN SEEN THROUGH A MICROSCOPE LIKE A STRIATED PYRAMID IN RELIEF HE RECOMMENDS TWO MODES OF CORRECTING THE ILLUSION THE FIRST IS TO BRING SUCCESSIVELY TO THE FOCUS OF THE INSTRUMENT THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE CRYSTAL IF THE PYRAMID BE IN RELIEF THE POINT WILL ARRIVE AT THE FOCUS SOONER THAN THE BASE WILL  IF THE PYRAMID BE HOLLOW THE CONTRARY WILL TAKE PLACE THE SECOND MODE IS TO PROJECT A STRONG LIGHT ON THE PYRAMID IN THE FIELD OF VIEW OF THE MICROSCOPE AND TO OBSERVE WHICH SIDES OF THE CRYSTAL ARE ILLUMINATED TAKING HOWEVER THE INVERSION OF THE IMAGE INTO CONSIDERATION IF A COMPOUND MICROSCOPE BE EMPLOYED THE INVERSION OF RELIEF IS VERY STRIKING WHEN A SKELETON CUBE IS LOOKED AT WITH ONE EYE AND THE FOLLOWING SINGULAR RESULTS MAY IN THIS CASE BE OBSERVED SO LONG AS THE MIND PERCEIVES THE CUBE HOWEVER THE FIGURE BE TURNED ABOUT ITS VARIOUS APPEAR ANCES WILL BE BUT DIFFERENT REPRESENTATIONS OF THE SAME OBJECT AND THE SAME PRIMNI TIVE FORM WILL BE SUGGESTED TO THE MIND BY ALL OF THEM BUT IT IS NOT SO IF THE CON VERSE FIGURE FIXES THE ATTENTION THE SERIES OF SUCCESSIVE PROJECTIONS CANNOT THEN BE REFERRED TO ANY FIGURE TO WHICH THEY ARE ALL COMMON AND THE SKELETON FIGURE WILL AP PEAR TO BE CONTINUALLY UNDERGOING A CHANGE OF SHAPE  12 I HAVE GIVEN AMPLE PROOF THAT OBJECTS WHOSE PICTURES DO NOT FALL ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINUE MAY STILL APPEAR SINGLE I WILL NOW ADDUCE AN EXPERIMENT WHICH PROVES THAT SIMILAR PICTURES FALLING ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINAE MNAY APPEAR DOUBLE

DRAW ON THE LEFT HAND FIGURE A FAINT VERTICAL LINE EXACTLY CORRESPONDING IN POSITION AND LENGTH TO THAT PRESENTED TO THE RIGHT EYE AND LET THE TWO LINES OF THIS LEFT HAND FIGURE INTERSECT EACH OTHER AT THEIR CENTRES LOOKING NOW AT THESE TWO DRAWINGS IN THE STEREOSCOPE THE TWO STRONG LINES EACH SEEN BY A DIF FERENT EYE WILL COINCIDE AND THE RESULTANT PERSPECTIVE LINE WILL APPEAR TO OCCUPY THE SAME PLACE AS BEFORE BUT THE FAINT LINE WHICH NOW FALLS ON A LINE OF THE LEFT RETINA WHICH CORRESPONDS WITH THE LINE OF THE RIGHT RETINA ON WHICH ONE OF THE COINCIDING STRONG LINES VIZ THE VERTICAL ONE FALLS APPEARS IN A DIFFERENT PLACE THE PLACE THIS FAINT LINE APPARENTLY OCCUPIES IS THE INTERSECTION OF THAT PLANE OF VISUAL DIRECTION OF THE LEFT EYE IN WHICH IT IS SITUATED WITH THE PLANE OF VISUAL DIRECTION OF THE RIGHT EYE WHICH CONTAINS THE STRONG VERTICAL LINE THIS EXPERIMENT AFFORDS ANOTHER PROOF THAT THERE IS NO NECESSARY PHYSIOLOGICAL CON NECTION BETWEEN THE CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINASA DOCTRINE WHICH HAS BEEN MAINTAINED BY SO MANY AUTHORS  13 BINOCULAR VISION OF JMAGES OF DIFFERENT M1AGNITUDES WE WILL NOW INQUIRE WHAT EFFECT RESULTS FRON PRESENTING SIMILAR IMAGES

AND OCCASION A SINGLE RESULTANT PERCEPTION THE LIMIT OF THE DIFFERENCE OF SIZE WITHIN WHICH THE SINGLE AP PEARANCE SUBSISTS MAY BE ASCERTAINED BY EMPLOYING TWO IMAGES OF EQUAL MAGNITUDE AND CAUSING ONE OF THEM TO RECEDE FROM THE EYE WHILE THE OTHER REMAINS AT A CON STANT DISTANCE THIS IS EFFECTED MERELY BY PULLING OUT THE SLIDING BOARD C FIG 8 WHILE THE OTHER C REMAINS FIXED THE SCREW HAVING PREVIOUSLY BEEN REMOVED THOUGH THE SINGLE APPEARANCE OF TWO IMAGES OF DIFFERENT SIZE IS BY THIS EXPERIMENT DEMONSTRATED THE OBSERVER IS UNABLE TO PERCEIVE WHAT DIFFERENCE EXISTS BETWEEN THE APPARENT MAGNITUDE OF THE BINOCULAR IMAGE AND THAT OF THE TWO MONOCULAR IMAGES TO DETERMINE THIS POINT THE STEREOSCOPE MUST BE DISPENSED WITH AND THE EXPERIMENT SO ARRANGED THAT ALL THREE SHALL BE SIMULTANEOUSLY SEEN WHICH MAY BE DONE IN THE FOL LOWING MANNER THE TWO DRAWINGS BEING PLACED SIDE BY SIDE ON A PLANE BEFORE THE EYES THE OPTIC AXES MUST BE MADE TO CONVERGE TO A NEARER POINT AS AT FIG 4 OR TO A MORE DISTANT ONE AS AT FIG 3 UNTIL THE THREE IMAGES ARE SEEN AT THE SAME TIME THE BINOCULAR IMAGE IN THE MIDDLE AND THE MONOCULAR IMAGES AT EACH SIDE IT WILL THUS HGE SEEN THAT THE BINOCULAR IMAGE IS APPARENTLY INTERMEDIATE IN SIZE BETWEEN THE TWO MONOCULAR ONES IF THE PICTURES BE TOO UNEQUAL IN MAGNITUDE THE BINOCULAR COINCIDENCE DOES NOT MDICCCXXXVIII 3 D386 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION TAKE PLACE IT APPEARS THAT IF THE INEQUALITY OF THE PICTURES BE GREATER THAN THE DIF FERENCE WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THE TWO PROJECTIONS OF THE SAME OBJECT WHEN SEEN IN THE MOST OBLIQUE POSITION OF THE EYES I E BOTH TURNED TO THE EXTREME RIGHT OR TO THE EX TRERNE LEFT ORDINARILY EMPLOYED THEY DO NOT COALESCE WERE IT NOT FOR THE BINOCULAR COINCIDENCE OF TWO IMAGES OF DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE OBJECTS WOULD APPEAR SINGLE ONLY WHEN THE OPTIC AXES CONVERGE IMMEDIATELY FORWARDS FOR IT IS ONLY WHEN THE CON VERGING VISUAL LINES FORM EQUAL ANGLES WITH THE VISUAL BASE THE LINE JOINING THE CEN TRES OF THE TWO EYES AS AT FIG 2 THAT THE TWO PICTURES CAN BE OF EQUAL MAGNITUDE BUT WHEN THEY FORM DIFFERENT ANGLES WITH IT AS AT FIG 24 THE DISTANCE FROM THE OBJECT TO EACH EYE IS DIFFERENT AND CONSEQUENTLY THE PICTURE PROJECTED ON EACH RETINA HAS A DIFFERENT MAGNITUDE IF A PIECE OF MONEY BE HELD IN THE POSITION A FIG 24 WHILE THE OPTIC AXES CONVERGE TO A NEARER POINT C IT WILL APPEAR DOUBLE AND THAT SEEN BY THE LEFT EYE WILL BE EVIDENTLY SMALLER THAN THE OTHER  14 PHENOMENA WHICH ARE OBSERVED WHEN OBJECTS OF DJFFERENT FORMS ARE SIMULTANEOUSLY PRESENTED TO CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE TWO RETINCC IF WE REGARD A PICTURE WITH THE RIGHT EYE ALONE FOR A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH OF TIME IT WILL BE CONSTANTLY PERCEIVED IF WE LOOK AT ANOTHER AND DISSIMILAR PICTURE WITH THE LEFT EYE ALONE ITS EFFECT WILL BE EQUALLY PERMANENT IT MIGHT THEREFORE BE EXPECTED THAT IF EACH OF THESE PICTURES WERE PRESENTED TO ITS CORRESPONDING EYE AT THE SAME TIME THE TWO WOULD APPEAR PERMANENTLY SUPERPOSED ON EACH OTHER THIS HOWEVER CON TRARY TO EXPECTATION IS NOT THE CASE IF A AND B FIG 25 ARE EACH PRESENTED AT THE SAME TIME TO A DIFFERENT EYE THE COMMON BORDER WILL REMAIN CONSTANT WHILE THE LETTER WITHIN IT WILL CHANGE ALTERNATELY FROM THAT WHICH WOULD BE PERCEIVED BY THE RIGHT EYE ALONE TO THAT WHICH WOULD BE PERCEIVED BY THE LEFT EYE ALONE AT THE MOMENT OF CHANGE THE LETTER WHICH HAS JUST BEEN SEEN BREAKS INTO FRAGMENTS WHILE FRAGMENTS OF THE LETTER WHICH IS ABOUT TO AP PEAR ININGLE WITH THEM AND ARE IMMEDIATELY AFTER REPLACED BY THE ENTIRE LETTER IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE IN THE POWER OF THE WILL TO DETERMINE THE APPEARANCE OF EITHER OF THE LETTERS BUT THE DURATION OF THE APPEARANCE SEEMS TO DEPEND ON CAUSES WHICH ARE UNDER OUR CONTROL THUS IF THE TWO PICTURES BE EQUALLY ILLUMINATED THE ALTERLNA TIONS APPEAR IN GENERAL OF EQUAL DURATION BUT IF ONE PICTURE BE INORE ILLUMINATED THAN THE OTHER THAT WHICH IS LESS SO WILL BE PERCEIVED DURING A SHORTER TIME I HAVE GENE RALLY MADE THIS EXPERIMENT WITH THE APPARATUS FIG 6 WHEN COMPLEX PICTURES ARE EMPLOYED IN THE STEREOSCOPE VARIOUS PARTS OF THEM ALTERNATE DIFFERENTLY THERE ARE SOME FACTS INTIMATELY CONNECTED WITH THE SUBJECT OF THE PRESENT ARTICLE WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN FREQUENTLY OBSERVED I ALLUDE TO THE EXPERIMENTS FIRST MADE BY DU TOUN IN WHICH TWO DIFFERENT COLOURS ARE PRESENTED TO CORRESPONDING PARTS OF THE TWO RETINUE IF A BLUE DISC BE PRESENTED TO THE RIGHT EYE AND A YELLOW DISC TO THE CORRESPONDING PART OF THE LEFT EYE INSTEAD OF A GREEN DISC WHICH WOULD APPEAR IF THESEMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 387 TWO COLOURS HAD MINGLED BEFORE THEIR ARRIVAL AT A SINGLE EYE THE MIND WILL PERCEIVE THE TWO COLOURS DISTINCTLY ONE OR THE OTHER ALTERNATELY PREDOMINATING EITHER PARTIALLY OR WHOLLY OVER THE DISC IN THE SAME MANNER THE MIND PERCEIVES NO TRACE OF VIOLET WHEN RED IS PRESENTED TO ONE EYE AND BLUE TO THE OTHER NOR ANY VESTIGE OF ORANGE WHEN RED AND YELLOW ARE SEPARATELY PRESENTED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THESE EXPERI MENTS MAY BE CONVENIENTLY REPEATED BY PLACING THE COLOURED DISCS IN THE STEREOSCOPE BUT THEY HAVE BEEN MOST USUALLY MADE BY LOOKING AT A WHITE OBJECT THROUGH DIF FERENTLY COLOURED GLASSES ONE APPLIED TO EACH EYE IN SOME AUTHORS WE FIND IT STATED CONTRARY TO FACT THAT IF SIMILAR OBJECTS OF DIF FERENT COLOUR BE PRESENTED ONE TO EACH EYE THE APPEARANCE WILL BE THAT COMPOUNDED OF THE TWO COLOURS DR REID AND JANIN ARE AMONG THE WRITERS WHO HAVE FALLEN INTO THIS INCONSIDERATE ERROR WHICH AROSE NO DOUBT FROM THEIR DECIDING ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS NOTIONS INSTEAD OF ASCERTAINING BY EXPERIMENT WHAT ACTUALLY DOES HAPPEN  15 NO QUESTION RELATING TO VISION HAS BEEN SO MNUCH DEBATED AS THE CAUSE OF THE SINGLE APPEARANCE OF OBJECTS SEEN BY BOTH EYES I SHALL IN THE PRESENT SECTION GIVE A SLIGHT REVIEW OF THE VARIOUS THEORIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ADVANCED BY PHILOSOPHERS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PHENOMENON IN ORDER THAT THE REMARKS I HAVE TO MAKE IN THE SUCCEEDING SECTION MAY BE PROPERLY UNDERSTOOD THE LAW OF VISIBLE DIRECTION FOR MONOCULAR VISION HAS BEEN VARIOUSLY STATED BY DIF FERENT OPTICAL WRITERS SOME HAVE MAINTAINED WITH DRS REID AND PORTERFIELD THAT EVERY EXTERNAL POINT IS SEEN IN THE DIRECTION OF A LINE PASSING FROM ITS PICTURE ON THE RETINA THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE EYE WHILE OTHERS HAVE SUPPOSED WITH DR SMITH THAT THE VISIBLE DIRECTION OF AN OBJECT COINCIDES WITH THE VISUAL RAY OR THE PRINCIPAL RAY OF THE PENCIL WHICH FLOWS FROM IT TO THE EYE DALEMBERT FURNISHED WITH IM PERFECT DATA RESPECTING THE REFRACTIVE DENSITIES OF THE HUMOURS OF THE EYE CALCULATED THAT THE APPARENT MAGNITUDES OF OBJECTS WOULD DIFFER WIDELY ON THE TWO SUPPOSITIONS AND CONCLUDED THAT THE VISIBLE POINT OF AN OBJECT WAS NOT SEEN IN EITHER OF THESE DI RECTIONS BUT SENSIBLY IN THE DIRECTION OF A LINE JOINING THE POINT ITSELF AND ITS IMAGE ON THE RETINA BUT HE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT HE COULD ASSIGN NO REASON FOR THIS LAW SIR DAVID BREWSTER PROVIDED WITH MORE ACCURATE DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THESE THREE LINES SO NEARLY COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER THAT  AT AN INCLINATION OF 300 A LINE PERPENDICULAR TO THE POINT OF IMPRESSION ON THE RETINA PASSES THROUGH THE COMMON CENTRE AND DOES NOT DEVIATE FROM THE REAL LINE OF VISIBLE DIRECTION MORE THAN HALF A DEGREE A QUANTITY TOO SMALL TO INTERFERE WITH THE PURPOSES OF VISION WE MAY THEREFORE ASSUME IN ALL OUR FUTURE REASONINGS THE TRUTH OF THE FOLLOWING DEFINITION GIVEN BY THIS EMINENT PHI LOSOPHER  AS THE INTERIOR EYEBALL IS AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE A PERFECT SPHERE LINES PERPENDICULAR TO THE SURFACE OF THE RETINA MUST ALL PASS THROUGH ONE SINGLE POINT  ENQUIRY SECT XIII 3 D 2388 MIR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION NAMELY THE CENTRE OF ITS SPHERICAL SURFACE THIS ONE POINT MAY BE CALLED THE CENTRE OF VISIBLE DIRECTION BECAUSE EVERY POINT OF A VISIBLE OBJECT WILL BE SEEN IN THE DIREC TION OF A LINE DRAWN FROM THIS CENTRE TO THE VISIBLE POINT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE RESULT OF ANY ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN THE SINGLE APPEARANCE OF OB JECTS TO BOTH EYES OR IN OTHER WORDS THE LAW OF VISIBLE DIRECTION FOR BINOCULAR VISION OUGHT TO CONTAIN NOTHING INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAW OF VISIBLE DIRECTION FOR MONOCULAR VISION  IT WAS THE OPINION OF AGUILONIUS THAT ALL OBJECTS SEEN AT THE SAME GLANCE WITH BOTH EYES APPEAR TO BE IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER THE HOROPTER HE DEFINES TO BE A LINE DRAWN THROUGH THE POINT OF INTERSECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES AND PARALLEL TO THE LINE JOINING THE CENTRES OF THE TWO EYES THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER TO BE A PLANE PASSING THROUGH THIS LINE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THAT OF THE OPTIC AXES ALL OBJECTS WHICH ARE IN THIS PLANE NUST ACCORDING TO HIM APPEAR SINGLE BECAUSE THE LINES OF DIRECTION IN WHICH ANY POINT OF AN OBJECT IS SEEN COINCIDE ONLY IN THIS PLANE AND NOWHERE ELSE AND AS THESE LINES CAN MEET EACH OTHER ONLY IN ONE POINT IT FOLLOWS FROM THE HYPO THESIS THAT ALL OBJECTS NOT IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER MUST APPEAL DOUBLE BECAUSE THEIR LINES OF DIRECTION INTERSECT EACH OTHER EITHER BEFORE OR AFTER THEY PASS THROUGH IT THIS OPINION WAS ALSO MAINTAINED BY DECHALES AND PORTERFIELD THAT IT IS ERRONEOUS I HAVE GIVEN I THINK SUFFICIENT PROOF IN SHOWING THAT WHEN THE OPTIC AXES CONVERGE TO ANY POINT OBJECTS BEFORE OR BEYOND THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER ARE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES EQUALLY SEEN SINGLE AS THOSE IN THAT PLANE DR WELLSS  NEW THEORY OF VISIBLE DIRECTION WAS A MODIFICATION OF THE PRECEDING HYPOTHESIS THIS ACUTE WRITER HELD WITH AGUILONIUS THAT OBJECTS ARE SEEN SINGLE ONLY WHEN THEY ARE IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT THEY APPEAR DOUBLE WHEN THEY ARE EITHER BEFORE OR BEYOND IT BUT HIE ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THIS SINGLE AP PEARANCE OF OBJECTS ONLY IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER TO DEPEND ON OTHER PRINCIPLES FROM WHICH HE DEDUCED CONTRARY TO AGUILONIUS THAT THE OBJECTS WHICH ARE DOUBLED DO NOT APPEAR IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER BUT IN OTHER PLACES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY THESE PRINCIPLES DR WELLS WAS LED TO HIS NEW THEORY BY A FACT WHICH HE ACCI DENTALLY OBSERVED AND WHICH HE COULD NOT RECONCILE WITH ANY EXISTING THEORY OF VISIBLE DIRECTION THIS FACT HAD THOUGH HE WAS UNAWARE OF IT BEEN PREVIOUSLY NOTICED BY DR SMITH IT IS ALREADY MENTIONED IN  8 AND IS THE ONLY INSTANCE OF BINOCULAR VISION OF RELIEF WHICH I HAVE FOUND RECORDED PREVIOUS TO MY OWN INVESTIGATIONS SO LITTLE DOES DR WELLSS THEORY APPEAL TO HAVE BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT NO SUBSEQUENT WRITER HAS ATTEMPTED EITHER TO CONFIRM OR DISPROVE HIS OPINIONS IT WOULD BE USELESS HERE TO DISCUSS THE PRINCIPLES OF THIS THEORY WHICH WAS FIAMED TO ACCOUNT FOR AN ANO MALOUS INDIVIDUAL FACT SINCE IT IS INCONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL RULES ON WHICH THAT FACT HAS BEEN NOW SHOWN TO DEPEND NOTWITHSTANDING THESE ERRONEOUS VIEWS THE C ESSAY UPON SINGLE VISION WITH TWO EYES CONTAINS MANY VALUABLE EXPERIMENTS AND REMARKS THE TRUTH OF WHICH ARE INDEPENDENT OF THE THEORY THEY WERE INTENDED TO ILLUSTRATEMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 389 THE THEORY WHICH HAS OBTAINED GREATEST CURRENCY IS THAT WHICH ASSUMES THAT AN OBJECT IS SEEN SINGLE BECAUSE ITS PICTURES FALL ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RE TINU THAT IS ON POINTS WHICH ARE SIMILARLY SITUATED WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO CENTRES BOTH IN DISTANCE AND POSITION THIS THEORY SUPPOSES THAT THE PICTURES PROJECTED ON THE RETINAE ARE EXACTLY SIMILAR TO EACH OTHER CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO PICTURES FALLING ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINAE AUTHORS WHO AGREE WITH REGARD TO THIS PROPERTY DIFFER WIDELY IN EXPLAINING WHY OBJECTS ARE SEEN IN THE SAME PLACE OR SINGLE ACCORDING TO THIS LAW DR SMITH MAKES IT TO DEPEND ENTIRELY ON CUSTOM AND EXPLAINS WHY THE EYES ARE HABITUALLY DIRECTED TOWARDS AN OBJECT SO THAT ITS PIC TURES FALL ON CORRESPONDING PARTS IN THE FOLLOWING MANNERA WHEN WE VIEW AN OB JECT STEADILY WE HAVE ACQUIRED A HABIT OF DIRECTING THE OPTIC AXES TO THE POINT IN VIEW BECAUSE ITS PICTURES FALLING UPON THE MIDDLE POINTS OF THE RETINAS ARE THEN DISTINCTER THAN IF THEY FELL UPON ANY OTHER PLACES AND SINCE THE PICTURES OF THE WHOLE OBJECT ARE EQUAL TO ONE ANOTHER AND ARE BOTH INVERTED WITH RESPECT TO THE OPTIC AXES IT FOL LOWS THAT THE PICTURES OF ANY COLLATERAL POINT ARE PAINTED UPON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE RETINAS DR REID AFTER A LONG DISSERTATION ON THE SUBJECT CONCLUDES  THAT BY AN ORIGINAL PROPERTY OF HUMAN EYES OBJECTS PAINTED UPON THE CENTRES OF THE TWO RETINAE OR UPON POINTS SIMILARLY SITUATED WITH REGARD TO THE CENTRES APPEAR IN THE SAME VISIBLE PLACE THAT THE MOST PLAUSIBLE ATTEMPTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS PROPERTY OF THE EYES HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFUL AND THEREFORE THAT IT MUST BE EITHER A PRIMARY LAW OF OUR CONSTITUTION OR THE CONSEQUENCE OF SOME MORE GENERAL LAW WHICH IS NOT YET DISCOVERED OTHER WRITERS WHO HAVE ADMITTED THIS PRINCIPLE HAVE REGARDED IT AS ARISING FROM ANATOMICAL STRUCTURE AND DEPENDENT ON CONNEXION OF NERVOUS FIBRES AMONG THESE STAND THE NAMES OF GALEN DI BRIGGS SIR ISAAC NEWTON ROHAULT DR HARTLEY DR WOLLASTON AND PROFESSOR MITLLER MANY OF THE SUPPORTERS OF THE THEORY OF CORRESPONDING POINTS HAVE THOUGHT OR RATHER HAVE ADMITTED WITHOUT THINKING THAT IT WAS NOT INCONSISTENT WVITH THE LAW OF AGUILONIUS BUT VERY LITTLE REFLECTION WILL SHOW THAT BOTH CANNOT BE MAINTAINED TOGETHER FOR CORRESPONDING LINES OF VISIBLE DIRECTION THAT IS LINES TERMINATING IN CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINUE CANNOT MEET IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER UNLESS THE OPTIC AXES BE PARALLEL AND THE PLANE BE AT AN INFINITE DISTANCE BEFORE THE EYES SOME OF THE MODERN GERMAN WRITERS HAVE INQUIRED WHAT IS THE CURVE IN WHICH OBJECTS APPEAR SINGLE WHILE THE OPTIC AXES ARE DIRECTED TO A GIVEN POINT ON THE HYPO THESIS THAT OBJECTS ARE SEEN SINGLE ONLY WHEN THEY FALL ON CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINUE AN ELEGANT PROPOSITION HAS

REPRESENT ONLY THE CIRCLE OF CURVATURE OF THE BOTTOM OF THE RETINA BUT THE REASONING IS EQUALLY TRUE IN BOTH CASES THE SAME REASONS FOUNDED ON THE EXPERIMENTS IN THIS MEMOIR WHICH DISPROVE THE THEORY OF AGUILONIUS INDUCE ME TO REJECT THE LAW OF CORRESPONDING POINTS AS AN AC CURATE EXPRESSION OF THE PHENOMENA OF SINGLE VISION ACCORDING TO THE FORMER OB JECTS CAN APPEAR SINGLE ONLY IN THE PLANE OF

APPEALING SINGLE THOUGH THEY ARE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES BEFORE THE EYES I HAVE ALREADY PROVED THAT THE ASSUMPTION MADE BY ALL THE MAINTAINERS OF THE THEORY OF CORRESPONDING POINTS NAMELY THAT THE TWO

THAT WE SEE WITH ONLY ONE EYE AT A TIME THOUGH BOTH REMAIN OPEN ONE ACCORDING TO THEM BEING RELAXED AND INAT TENTIVE TO OBJECTS WHILE THE OTHER IS UPON THE STRETCH IT IS A SUFFICIENT REFUTATION OF

SHOULD UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES BE SEEN AGAIN IN MANY CASES WHICH I HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THE SIMULTANEOUS AFFECTION OF THE TWO RE TINAE EXCITES A DIFFERENT IDEA IN THE MIND TO THAT CONSEQUENT ON

THINGS COULD NOT OCCUR DID WE SEE WITH ONLY ONE EYE AT A TIME DU TOUR HELD THAT THOUGH WE MIGHT OCCASIONALLY SEE AT THE SAME TIME WITH BOTH EYES YET THE MIND CANNOT BE AFFECTED SIMULTANEOUSLY BY TWO CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO IMAGES HE WAS LED TO THIS OPINION BY THE CURIOUS FACTS ALLUDED TO IN  14 IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO DISPROVE THIS CONJECTURE BY EXPERIMENT BUT ALL THAT THE EXPE RIMENTS ADDUCED IN ITS FAVOUR AND OTHERS RELATING TO THE DISAPPEARANCE OF OBJECTS TO ONE EYE REALLY PROVES IS THAT THE MIND IS INATTENTIVE TO IMPRESSIONS MADE ON ONE RE TINA WHEN IT CANNOT COMBINE THE IMPRESSIONS ON THE TWO RETINAE TOGETHER SO AS TO RESEMBLE THE PERCEPTION OF SOME EXTERNAL OBJECTS BUT THEY AFFORD NO GROUND WHAT EVER FOR SUPPOSING THAT THE MIND CANNOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES ATTEND

DIMENSIONS WHEN TWO PICTURES OF IT ARE PRE SENTED TO THE EYES ACCORDING TO IT ALSO NO DIFFERENCE SHOULD BE PERCEIVED IN THE RE LIEF OF OBJECTS WHEN SEEN BY ONE OR BOTH EYES WHICH IS CONTRARY TO WHAT REALLY HAP PENS THE PROOFS BESIDES THAT WE PERCEIVE EXTERNAL OBJECTS BY MEANS OF PICTURES ON THE RETINAE ARE SO NUMEROUS AND CONVINCING THAT A CONTRARY CONJECTURE CANNOT BE EN TERTAINED FOR A MOMENT ON THIS ACCOUNT IT WILL SUFFICE MERELY TO MENTION TWO OTHER THEORIES WHICH PLACE THE SEAT OF VISION IN THE VITREOUS HUMOUR VALLET WITHOUT DENYING THE EXISTENCE OF PICTURES ON THE RETINA HAS ADVOCATED THAT WE SEE THE RELIEF OF OBJECTS BY MEANS OF ANTERIOR FOCI ON THE HYALOID MEMBRANE AND RASPAIL HAS DEVELOPED AT CONSIDERABLE LENGTH THE STRANGE HYPOTHESIS THAT IMAGES ARE NEITHER FORMED IN THE VITREOUS HUMOUR NOR PAINTED ON THE RETINA BUT ARE IMMEDIATELY PER CEIVED AT THE FOCUS OF THE LENTICULAR SYSTEM OF WHICH THE EYE IS FORMED  16 IT NOW REMAINS TO EXAMINE WHY TWO DISSIMILAR PICTURES PROJECTED ON THE TWO RE TINWE GIVE RISE TO THE PERCEPTION OF AN OBJECT IN RELIEF I WILL NOT ATTEMPT AT PRESENT TO GIVE THE COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THIS QUESTION WHICH IS FAR FROM BEING SO EASY AS AT A FIRST GLANCE IT MAY APPEAR TO BE AND IS INDEED ONE OF GREAT COMPLEXITY I SHALL IN THIS PLACE MERELY CONSIDER THE MOST OBVIOUS EXPLANATIONS WHICH MIGHT BE OFFERED AND SHOW THEIR INSUFFICIENCY TO EXPLAIN THE WHOLE OF THE PHENOMENA  ACT PAR 1743 M P 334 T NOUVELLE THDORIE DE LA VISION PAR 1823  TRAIT6 DE LA SCIENCE DU DESSEIN PAR 1821 P 270  NOUVEAU SYSTBME DE CHIMIE ORGANIQUE T 2 P 329392 MR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION IT MAY BE SUPPOSED THAT WE SEE BUT ONE POINT OF A FIELD OF VIEW DISTINCTLY AT THE SAME INSTANT THE ONE NAMELY TO WHICH THE OPTIC AXES ARE DIRECTED WHILE ALL OTHER POINTS ARE SEEN SO INDISTINCTLY THAT THE MIND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE THEMN TO BE EITHER SINGLE OR DOUBLE AND THAT THE FIGURE IS APPRECIATED BY SUCCESSIVELY DIRECTING THE POINT OF CON VERGENCE OF THE OPTIC AXES SUCCESSIVELY TO A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF ITS POINTS TO ENABLE US TO JUDGE ACCURATELY OF ITS FORM THAT THERE IS A DEGREE OF INDISTINCTNESS IN THOSE PARTS OF THE FIELD OF VIEW TO WHICH THE EYES ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY DIRECTED AND WHICH INCREASES WITH THE DISTANCE FROM THAT POINT CANNOT BE DOUBTED AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE OBJECTS THUS OBSCURELY SEEN ARE FREQUENTLY DOUBLED IN ORDINARY VISION IT MAY BE SAID THIS INDISTINCTNESS AND DUPLICITY IS NOT ATTENDED TO BECAUSE THE EYES SHIFTING CONTINUALLY FROMN POINT TO POINT EVERY PART OF THE OBJECT IS SUCCESSIVELY RENDERED DISTINCT AND THE PERCEPTION OF THE OBJECT IS NOT THE CONSEQUENCE OF A SINGLE GLANCE DURING WHICH ONLY A SMALL PART OF IT IS SEEN DISTINCTLY BUT IS FORMED FROM A COMPARISON OF ALL THE PICTURES SUCCESSIVELY SEEN WHILE THE EYES WERE CHANGING FROM ONE POINT OF THE OBJECT TO ANOTHER ALL THIS IS IN SOME DEGREE TRUE BUT WERE IT ENTIRELY SO NO APPEARANCE OF RELIEF SHOULD PRESENT ITSELF WHEN THE EYES REMAIN INTENTLY FIXED ON ONE POINT OF A BINOCULAR IMAGE IN THE STEREOSCOPE BUT ON PERFORMING THE EXPERIMENT CAREFULLY IT WILL BE FOUND PROVIDED THE PICTURES DO NOT EXTEND TOO FAR BEYOND THE CENTRES OF DISTINCT VISION THAT THE IMAGE IS STILL SEEN SINGLE AND IN RELIEF WIHEN THIS CONDITION IS FULFILLED WERE THE THEORY OF CORRESPONDING POINTS TRUE THE APPEARANCE SHOULD BE THAT OF THE SUPERPOSITION OF THE TWO DRAWINGS TO WHICH HOWEVER IT HAS NOT THE SLIGHTEST SIMILI TUDE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS ARE EQUALLY DECISIVE AGAINST THIS THEORY EXP 1 DRAW TWO LINES ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG AND INCLINED TOWARDS EACH OTHER AS IN FIG 10 ON A SHEET OF PAPER AND HAVING CAUSED THEM TO COINCIDE BY CONVERGING THE OPTIC AXES TO A POINT NEARER THAN THE PAPER LOOK INTENTLY ON THE UPPER END OF THE RESULTANT LINE WITHOUT ALLOWING THE EYES TO WANDER FROM IT FOR A MOMENT THE EN TIRE LINE WILL APPEAR SINGLE AND IN ITS PROPER RELIEF AND A PIN OR A PIECE OF STRAIGHT WIRE MAY WITHOUT THE LEAST DIFFICULTY BE MADE TO COINCIDE EXACTLY IN POSITION WITH IT O1R IF WHILE THE OPTIC AXES CONTINUE TO BE DIRECTED TO THE UPPER AND NEARER END THE POINT OF A PIN BE MADE TO COINCIDE WITH THE LOWER AND FURTHER END OR WITH ANY INTER MEDIATE POINT OF THE RESULTANT LINE THE COINCIDENCE WILL REMAIN EXACTLY THE SAME WHEN THE OPTIC AXES ARE MOVED AND MEET THERE THE EYES SOMETIMES BECOME FATIGUED WHICH CAUSES THE LINE TO APPEAR DOUBLE AT THOSE PARTS TO WHICH THE OPTIC AXES ARE NOT FIXED BUT IN SUCH CASE ALL APPEARANCE OF RELIEF VANISHES THE SAME EXPERIMENT MAY BE TRIED WITH MORE COMPLEX FIGURES BUT THE PICTURES SHOULD NOT EXTEND TOO FAR BEYOND THE CENTRES OF THE RETINA ANOTHER AND A BEAUTIFUL PROOF THAT THE APPEARANCE OF RELIEF IN BINOCULAR VISION IS AN EFFECT INDEPENDENT OF THE MOTIONS OF THE EYES MAY BE OBTAINED BY IMPRESSING AN THE RETINVE OCULAR SPECTRA OF THE COMPONENT FIGURES FOR THIS PURPOSE THE DRAWINGS SHOULD BE FORMED OF BROAD COLOURED LINES ON A GROUND OF THE COMPLEMENTARY COLOURMR WHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION 393 FOR INSTANCE RED LINES ON A GREEN GROUND AND BE VIEWED EITHER IN THE STEREOSCOPE OR IN THE APPARATUS FIG 6 AS THE ORDINARY FIGURES ARE TAKING CARE HOWEVER TO FIX THE EYES ONLY TO A SINGLE POINT OF THE COMPOUND FIGURE THE DRAWINGS MUST BE STRONGLY ILLU MINATED AND AFTER A SUFFICIENT TIME HAS ELAPSED TO IMPRESS THE SPECTRA ON THE RETINAE THE EYES MUST BE CAREFULLY COVERED TO EXCLUDE ALL EXTERNAL LIGHT A SPECTRUM OF THE OBJECT IN RELIEF WILL THEN APPEAR BEFORE THE CLOSED EYES IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT A SPEC TRUM IMPRESSED ON A SINGLE EYE AND SEEN IN THE DARK FREQUENTLY ALTERNATELY APPEARS AND DISAPPEARS THESE ALTERNATIONS DO NOT CORRESPOND IN THE SPECTRA IMPRESSED ON THE TWO RETINAE AND HENCE A CURIOUS EFFECT ARISES SOMETIMES THE RIGHT EYE SPECTRUM WILL BE SEEN ALONE SOMETIMES THAT OF THE LEFT EYE AND AT THOSE MOMENTS WHEN THE TWO APPEAR TOGETHER THE BINOCULAR SPECTRUM WILL PRESENT ITSELF IN BOLD RELIEF AS IN THIS CASE THE PICTURES CANNOT SHIFT THEIR PLACES ON THE RETINU IN WHATEVER MANNER THE EYES BE MOVED ABOUT THE OPTIC AXES CAN DURING THE EXPERIMENT ONLY CORRESPOND WITH A SINGLE POINT OF EACH WHEN AN OBJECT OR A PART OF AN OBJECT THUS APPEARS IN RELIEF WHILE THE OPTIC AXES ARE DIRECTED TO A SINGLE BINOCULAR POINT IT IS EASY TO SEE THAT EACH POINT OF THE FIGURE THAT APPEARS SINGLE IS SEEN AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE TWO LINES OF VISIBLE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS SEEN BY EACH EYE SEPARATELY WHETHER THESE LINES OF VISIBLE DIRECTION TERMI NATE AT CORRESPONDING POINTS OF THE TWO RETINAE OR NOT BUT IF WE WERE TO INFER THE CONVERSE OF THIS VIZ THAT EVERY POINT OF AN OBJECT IN RELIEF IS SEEN BY A SINGLE GLANCE AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE LINES OF VISIBLE DIRECTION IN WHICH IT IS SEEN BY EACH EYE SINGLY WE SHOULD BE IN ERROR ON THIS SUPPOSITION OB JECTS BEFORE OR BEYOND THE INTERSECTION OF THE OPTIC AXES SHOULD NEVER APPEAR DOUBLE AND WE HAVE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE THAT THEY DO THE DETERMINATION OF THE POINTS WHICH SHALL APPEAR SINGLE SEEMS TO DEPEND IN NO SMALL DEGREE ON PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF THE FORM WE ARE REGARDING NO DOUBT SOME LAW OR RULE OF VISION MAY BE DISCOVERED WHICH SHALL INCLUDE ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH SINGLE VISION BY MEANS OF NONCORRE SPONDING POINTS OCCURS AND IS LIMITED I HAVE MADE NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ATTAINING THIS END AND HAVE ASCERTAINED SOME OF THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH SINGLE AND DOUBLE VISION DEPEND THE CONSIDERATION OF WHICH HOWEVER MUST AT PRESENT BE DEFERRED SUFFICIENT HOWEVER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO PROVE THAT THE LAWS OF BINOCULAR VISIBLE DI RECTION HITHERTO LAID DOWN ARE TOO RESTRICTED TO BE TRUE THE LAW OF AGUILONIUS AS SUMES THAT OBJECTS IN THE PLANE OF THE HOROPTER ARE ALONE SEEN SINGLE AND THE LAW OF CORRESPONDING POINTS CARRIED TO ITS NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES THOUGH THESE CONSE QUENCES WERE UNFORESEEN BY ITS FIRST ADVOCATES MANY OF WHOM THOUGHT THAT IT WAS CONSISTENT WITH THE LAW OF AGUILONIUS LEADS TO THE CONCLUSION THAT NO OBJECT APPEARS SINGLE UNLESS IT IS SEEN IN A CIRCLE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRES OF VISIBLE DIRECTION IN EACH EYE AND THE POINT OF CONVERGENCE OF THE OPTIC AXES BOTH OF THESE ARE INCON SISTENT WITH THE SINGLE VISION OF OBJECTS WHOSE POINTS LIE OUT OF THE PLANE IN ONE CASE AND THE CIRCLE IN THE OTHER AND THAT OBJECTS DO APPEAR SINGLE UINDER CIRCUMSTANCES MDCCCXXXVIII 3 E394 MR WLHEATSTONE ON THE PHYSIOLOGY OF VISION THAT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY THESE LAWS HAS I THINK BEEN PLACED BEYOND DOUBT BY THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE BROUGHT FORWARD SHOULD IT BE HEREAFTER PROVED THAT ALL POINTS IN THE PLANE OR IN THE CIRCLE ABOVE MENTIONED ARE SEEN SINGLE AND FROM THE GREAT IN DISTINCTNESS OF LATERAL IMAGES IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO GIVE THIS PROOF THE LAW MUST BE QUALIFIED BY THE ADMISSION THAT POINTS OUT OF THEM DO NOT ALWAYS APPEAR DOUBLE

dtducedIrom those observations The elenments whiclh have a direct influence are the differ ence of the longitudes of the two stars and the difference of the longitudes of the moon during the interval of the two oc cultations deduced from thie tables I have calculated with all possible care the places of the moon corresponding to the monment of the two immersions observed at Figueras by the new tables and I think I hiave obtained all the accuracy of whichi the tables are susceptible I have calculated also by the tables of the third edition of Lalande making use of the epochs of mean longitude anoma ly and supplement of the node of the new tables and the dif ference of longitudes during the interval of the two immersions differ but one seconid The differences of latitudes agree with the result of the tables of Burg I have compared the right ascensions of the different cata logues and thie Connoisance des temps for the year 1808 and hlave moreover calculated various observations made by Mr Lalande anid the result whichi I have obtained ascertains the difference of the longitudes of the two stars within the limits of 08 and the latitudes witlhin 1GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATIONS 367 The difference of latitudes at conjunction of  in page 215 appears to be within the limits of 1 supposing the error in the difference of the longitudes of the moon 05 of the stars 08 and the influence of an error of 2 in the difference of the latitudes of the stars and the moon the sum of the three errors supposing it on one side would influence the result of the horizontal parallax of the moon only l0 If it should be supposed that the periodical coefficients of La Place represent the nmotion of the lunar parallax better than the coefficients of the tables of Burg the constant equatorial will result from the present observations57 010 and the constant equatorial of the new tables is the same The longitude of PortoRico calculated by these elements is the samle as

which was seen an assemblaCe of houses built in the water and defended with drawbridges According to the relation of Vesptleci this port was 80 leagues south of that where the fleet subsequently arrived anfi which ras placed under the Tropic of Cancer We are inclined to think that this port with its dwellings built in the water was no other than Vera Cruz with the Isle of Sacrifices and that which Erijalva called San Juan de Ulua and of which Herrera gives an idea in no wise contradictino the impression that Vespucci had received in likelaing it to Venice Thence he sailed to another port 80 leagues distant well watered aboullding in fish and in birds amongst which Vespucci mentions parroquets This port was situatel in a country which according to the Italian text by Banlini and Canovai is desiglwated by the name of Lariab This Lariab M Varnhaoen contends is Caric6 or Cariah disfigured by the transcriber and is the port of Tampico From this point he says Vespucci proceeded northwardy  COaStillg along an exterlt estimated at 870 leaaues By a comparison of his narrative with other documents it wotlld appear that he well recoonised the Mississippi and that he pursued his course to Florida the southern extremity of which peninsula he reached tomTards the end of April 1498 From this point he must have passed throuoh the Bahama channel and continued to coast alono the shores of the United States for more than thirty clays until after a navigation of thirteen months conseqvlently in the month of June we find him not far from the port called by Vespucci the best in the world This port could be nowhere except in the Gulf of St Law rence After thirtyseven days it was decided to leave it but the natives havinC a feud with certain others who inhabited an island a hundred leaCues distant the navigators considered themselves obliCed to take part with the former in return for the treatment they had received After a sail of seven days eastnortheast they arrived at al1 island named Iti They took some prisoners there a part of whom sz7ere given over to the natives of the Gulf who returned to their own country Notwithstandint the resemblance of the names we must be careful not to confound as has been done this isle of Iti surrolanded by other islands inhabited or desert with that of Haiti or His paniola This expedition did not return to Cadiz until the month of October 1498 after a voyare of eighteen months The author cites various proofs in fa7our of the authenticity of the first voyaCe of ATespucci he afterwards directs his attention to overthrow objec tions made against it and he qllotes an important document in support of his positions in the shape of a letter dated in 1506 which was discovered by Ranke at Vienna aIld pubished by Bumboldt at p 157 of the fifth volume of his Examex Crittgue In addition he aSords us at the end of his pamphlet facsimiles of three notes attributed to Columbus and bearing closely on the subject The ultimate conclusion to which M Varnhagen arrives is that Vespucci undotlbtedly accomltanied Pinzon and Solis and with a fleet of follr ships between 1497 and August 1498 discovered and explored all the eastern coast of North Amelica from Yucatan and the Gulf of hIexico to the most northern parts of the United States 14 Notes on Ghitan By KEITH E ABBOTT 13sq HM Consul Tehran SHILAN iS a narror strip of

mollrltains holvever offera salubrious reftlge during this periodi but a person is there in conhplete seclusion and cut off from intercoulse with the neiChbourhood by the distance and the badness of the roads Few of the inhabitants of the flat country can take alvantage of these finc retleats in the unhealthy season becallse a11 hands are then occupied with the productioll of silk The natives of

bazaars are extetlsive though not showy the chief dispay in them consists of Russian hardware glassware and earthenware and some Enolish lanufactures The streets are paved with small stones in wet

but I believe that it is not in antr part aTery briny Erlzilli contains 300 to 400 houses and shops and is the only seaport on the coast of Ghilan It is situated on the extreme point of a singularly narrow and long strip of sand which with one of similar shape advancing from the east and nearly joininC it almost separates the lake or backwater of Enzilli from the Caspian leaving a passaCe between

lying close to the shore and people can step from it on board There is aluple accommodation for all the vessels which visit this port but the larger class are obliged to discharte part of their

would have been greater for when I was at Enzilli there were between 20 and 30 vessels of all descriptions in the harbour and lnany may be supposed to make more than one trip in the year to this port

Enzilli  but the same reasons which induce the government to nevlect the repaiIs of the Peeree Eazaar road render it also their policy to impede tlle free navigation of this little stream which from wallt of attention has its course blocked up in various parts by fallen trees and nlulbanks In summer when the water is low on account of tese obstructions boats cannot ascend the stream I believe and in winter the current is so strong that it takes a day to ascenel from the lake to near Resht a distallce of about 10 miles In conclusion I wotlld observe that Ghilan thouh in wretched hands and kept

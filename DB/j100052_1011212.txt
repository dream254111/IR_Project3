J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011212,REASONS FOR ENCOURAGING JAPANESE IMMIGRATION,I242600,REASONS FOR ENCOURAGING JAPANESE IMMIGRATION BY JOHN P IRISH NAVAL OFFICER OF CUSTOMS FOR THE PORT OF SAN FRANCISCO CAL WHETHER THE UNITED STATES SHOULD ANY LONGER ENCOURAGE ANY IMMIGRATION IS DOUBTFUL THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD TREAT ALL IMMIGRATION ALIKE IS FAR LESS DOUBTFUL SINCE IT IMPLIES A POLICY THAT MAKES FOR INTERNATIONAL PEACE AND OUR OWN NATIONAL DIGNITY AGITA TORS THEMSELVES OF ALIEN BIRTH ORIGINATED OPPOSITION TO ASIATICS IN CALIFORNIA PRIOR TO I86O IN THE LEGISLATIVE SESSION OF I86I A COM MITTEE THAT HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY APPOINTED TO THAT DUTY REPORTED UPON AN EXHAUSTIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE EFFECT HERE OF THE PRESENCE OF CHINESE AFTER A STATISTICAL STATEMENT AND AN ARRAY OF ECONOMIC FACTS THE COMMITTEE SAID WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THESE FACTS WILL DEEPLY IMPRESS YOU AND OUR CONSTITUENTS AND IT WILL BE WELL TO PONDER THEM BEFORE ANY ACTION SHALL BE PROPOSED THAT WILL HAVE A TENDENCY TO DISTURB SO IMPORTANT AN INTEREST AND DRIVE FROM OUR STATE A CLASS OF FOREIGNERS SO PEACEFUL INDUSTRIOUS AND USEFUL YOUR COMMITTEE TRUST THAT NO MORE LEGISLATION WILL BE HAD CALCULATED TO DEGRADE THE CHINESE IN OUR STATE THAT REPORT SETTLED THE QUESTION FOR MANY YEARS UNTIL IT BECAME THE SUBJECT OF AGITATION ON THE SAND LOT LATE IN THE SEVENTIES WHEN THAT REPORT WAS MADE THE POPULATION OF CALIFORNIA WAS 379994 OF WHICH 50OOO WERE CHINESE THE ONLY ASIATICS THEN HERE CARRYING OUT THE PROPORTIONS OF OUR PRESENT POPULATION WE SHOULD HAVE 300000 ASIATICS BUT WE HAVE ONLY 55904 CHINESE AND JAPAN ESE COMBINED SINCE THE AGITATORS HAVE DIRECTED THEIR EFFORTS AGAINST THE JAPANESE ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY IT IS NOTED THAT FAVOR FOR THE CHINESE HAS RISEN ALL OF THE ARGUMENTS FORMERLY MADE AGAINST THEM ARE NOW DIRECTED AGAINST THE JAPANESE IT IS OF HISTORICAL INTEREST THAT THESE ARGUMENTS ARE ALL TAKEN BODILY FROM THE CAMPAIGN OF PERSECU TION OF THE JEWS IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE FROM THE MIDDLE AGES DOWN 294REASONS FOR ENCOURAGING JAPANESE IMMIGRATION TO MODERN TIMES WHEN CIVILIZATION AND ENLIGHTENMENT EFFECTED THE EMANCIPATION OF THAT MISTREATED RACE AS FOR IMMIGRATION IN GENERAL WE HAVE ACQUIRED THE HABIT OF SAYING THAT NONE SHOULD BE ADMITTED WITH WHICH WE CANNOT ASSIM ILATE THIS HAS PUT UPON OUR ANGLOSAXON BLOOD THE MIGHTY TASK OF ASSIMILATING THE ALIEN PEOPLES OF SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE AND WE ARE RECENTLY LEARNING THAT ASSIMILATION IS A BILATERAL PROCESS AND THAT THE VAST INFLUX OF THOSE PEOPLES WHO ARE IN SEMI RACIAL ACCORD WITH US IS DILUTING OUR ORIGINAL STOCK AND THAT INSTEAD OF ASSIMILATING WE ARE BEING ASSIMILATED ECONOMIC PRESSURE HAS EXPELLED EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS FROM THEIR NATIVE SOIL AND THEY HAVE RESORTED HERE IN SUCH NUMBERS AS TO OVERCOME OUR PREPOTENCY AND EVEN THREATEN CHANGES IN OUR INSTITUTIONS IN VIEW OF THIS IT IS WELL TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE CHARGE THAT THE JAPANESE ARE NONASSIMILABLE AND THEREFORE SHOULD BE EXCLUDED HAS ANY MERIT THE JAPANESE ARE LIKE US A TEMPERATE ZONE RACE WITH A FORM OF CIVILIZATION HIGH IN ITS ESSENTIALS AND MUCH OLDER THAN OUR OWN IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE TERM COOLIE IN ITS USUAL SENSE APPLIES TO THEM THE COMMON PEOPLE OF JAPAN AS WE KNOW THEM HERE MORE NEARLY RESEMBLE THE IRISH PEASANTRY THAN THE EAST INDIAN COOLIE THEY ARE VERY INDUSTRIOUS FRUGAL TEMPERATE AND ORDERLY WITH QUICK WIT AND INTELLECTUAL ALERTNESS BY THE STANDARDS ESTABLISHED BY OUR IMMIGRATION LAWS AND THE REGULATIONS FOR THEIR ENFORCEMENT THE JAPANESE ARE DESIRABLE IMMIGRANTS JUDGED BY THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THEY BRING WITH THEM THE PERCENTAGE THAT SEEK AID IN PUBLIC HOSPITALS AND ELEEMOSYNARY INSTITUTIONS AND THEIR PER CENTAGE OF ILLITERACY UPON THESE POINTS THE OFFICIAL IMMIGRATION RECORDS GIVE THE FOLLOWING TESTIMONY MONEY PER CAPITA JAPANESE  3109 POLISH  1151 SOUTH ITALIANS  1096 SCANDINAVIAN 2652 IRISH  2642 SLOVAK  I375 HEBREW  I536 MAGYAR

CITIES THE JAPANESE TAKE KINDLY TO RURAL LIFE AND PRODUCTIVE FARM LABOR IN CALIFORNIA THE LATIN RACES ARE NUMEROUS IN THE COAST CITIES THEY SKIP THE GREAT VALLEY WHICH IS THE SEAT OF VARIED AGRI CULTURAL AND HORTICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND REAPPEAR IN THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS AROUND THE MINING TOWNS AND LUMBER CAMPS IN THE DELTA OF THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS AND IN THE GREAT VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA IS THE DEMAND FOR RURAL LABOR WHICH THE CHINESE FORMERLY SUPPLIED AND AS THEIR NUMBER DECREASES UNDER EXCLUSION THE DEMAND IS NOW MET BY THE JAPANESE THE PRODUCTION OF RAISINS SUGAR BEETS ASPARAGUS ONIONS AND OTHER LOW GROWING FIELD CROPS AND THE FRUIT HARVEST CALL FOR RELIABLE LABOR RESISTANT TO CLIMATIC CONDITIONS AND ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE STOOPING POSTURE IN WHICH MUCH OF THIS WORK MUST BE PERFORMED SO FAR AMERICAN LABOR HAS NOT PROVED EFFICIENT OR RELIABLE IN THESE OCCUPATIONS AND EUROPEAN LABOR IS BUT LITTLE MORE SO BUT THE SHORTBACKED SHORTLEGGED ASIATICS HAVE PROVED RELIABLE IN ALL THIS SQUAT WORK WHICH MUST BE PERFORMED IN A TEMPERATURE OF IOO TO IIO DEGREES THEY EXECUTE THE NEEDFUL PRIMARY PROCESSES IN THESE FORMS OF PRODUCTION AND THEREBY FURNISH COMMERCE WITH MERCHANDISE WHICH IN ITS TRANSMUTA TION TRANSPORTATION AND EXCHANGE PROVIDES FOR AMERICAN LABOR OCCU PATION AT ITS OWN HIGH WAGES AND FOR COMMERCE ITS PROFIT THIS FACT IS RECOGNIZED BY THE FRUIT GROWERS OF CALIFORNIA WHO IN THEIR ANNUAL CONVENTION IN I907 BY UNANIMOUS VOTE DEMANDED SUCH MODIFICATION OF THE CHINESE EXCLUSION LAW AND OF THE ANTIJAPANESE POLICY AS WOULD PERMIT A CERTAIN IMMIGRATION OF BOTH RACES A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SUBJECT IN RESPECT TO ITS INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL PHASES SUPPORTS THE LEGISLATIVE REPORT OF I86I THAT THE PRESENCE OF EASTERN ASIATICS HERE IS OF INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL BENEFIT TO THE STATE JAPANESE FARM LABORERS HAVE NOTABLE CHARACTERISTICS OF WHICH THEIR PERSONAL CLEANLINESS IS ESPECIALLY TO BE NOTED THEY REQUIRE FACILITIES FOR A HOT BATH AND AT THE CLOSE OF 296 76REASONS FOR ENCOURAGING JAPANESE INMMNIGRATION A DAYS LABOR THEY BATHE AND CHANGE TO DRY CLOTHING BEFORE EATING DINNER JAPANESE FARM LABOR BY THE MONTH EXACTS I50 PER DAY WAGES THE LARGEST FARMER AND LARGEST EMPLOYER OF FARM LABOR IN CALIFORNIA IS MR GEORGE SHIMA A JAPANESE WHO PAYS AN ANNUAL RENTAL OF 8OOOO FOR LANDS FARMED ON THE LEVEED ISLANDS IN THE DELTA OF THE SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN RIVERS IN HIS VAST OPERATIONS HE EMPLOYS AMERICAN JAPANESE CHINESE AND EUROPEAN LABOR GETTING THE BEST RESULTS BY SUCH COORDINATION OF LABOR HIS AMERICAN AND EUROPEAN LABORERS ARE PAID THE GOING WAGE AND ARE EMPLOYED IN THE WORK THAT PRECEDES AND FOLLOWS THE PRIMARY PROCESSES OF TILLAGE PERFORMED BY JAPANESE HIS JAPANESE LABOR IS PAID BY THE YEAR HIS COMMON LABORERS GET 250 PER ANNUM AND FOUND IN THEIR WORK CLOTHING DIET AND DORMITORY HIS JAPANESE FOREMEN ARE PAID 350 AND FOUND IN GOOD YEARS HE PAYS TO LABORERS AND FOREMEN A BONUS IN THE NATURE OF PROFIT SHARING WHILE HE HAS BROUGHT ABOUT THIS COORDINATION OF LABOR THE SYSTEM HAS NOW BEEN ADOPTED BY AMERICAN EMPLOYERS THE SUGAR BEET FIELDS ARE PLOWED PREPARED AND PLANTED BY AMERICAN LABOR AT HIGH WAGES USING THE BEST IM PROVED AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY WHEN THE BEETS GROW THEY MUST BE THINNED BY HAND AND WEEDED FOR A SPACE ON EACH SIDE OF THE ROW THIS BEING SQUAT LABOR IS PERFORMED BY JAPANESE AND BY CHINESE WHEN THEY CAN BE HAD THE AMERICAN LABOR REAPPEARS IN CULTIVATING THE CROP RIDING SPRING SEATED ON IMPROVED IMPLEMENTS AT THE HARVEST THE JAPANESE REAPPEAR AND FROM THAT TIME ON THE CROP FURNISHES HIGHLY PAID WORK TO AMERICAN LABOR UNTIL IT REACHES THE CONSUMER INVESTORS IN THE BEET SUGAR BUSINESS HERE INSIST THAT AS THE SQUAT PART OF THE WORK IS PERFORMED WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS HIGH IT IS SO REPUGNANT TO AMERICAN LABOR THAT JAPANESE ARE A NECESSITY AND THAT BY THIS COORDINATION OF LABOR ONLY IS IT POSSIBLE TO DEVELOP THIS VALUABLE RESOURCE OF THE STATE THE JAPANESE STANDARD OF LIVING IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY OF COURSE CANNOT ESCAPE THE ECONOMIC LAW BUT IS FIXED BY THE WAGES OF LABOR TO THIS LAW ALL COUNTRIES ARE SUBJECT UP TO THE BEGINNING OF THE IRISH EXODUS TO THE UNITED STATES LABORERS WAGES IN IRELAND WERE SIX CENTS PER DAY SOMETIMES RISING TO EIGHT CENTS BUT T1HE STANDARD OF LIVING LONG FIXED BY LOW WAGES ROSE WHEN THE IRISH CAME IN CONTACT WITH BETTER CONDITIONS HERE THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE JAPAN 297 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ESE THEY LIVE WELL THE LABORERS WHEN AT LEISURE DRESS WELL IN OUR COSTUME WHEN ONE BY TWO OR THREE YEARS WORK HAS ACCU MULATED FROM 500 TO 750 HE IS ENTERPRISING AND USUALLY SEES SOME OVERLOOKED RESOURCE IN WHICH HE INVESTS HIS SAVINGS AND LABOR AND ADVANCES RAPIDLY IN ALL THESE RESPECTS HE DIFFERS NOT AT ALL FROM THE IMMIGRANTS FROM OTHER LOW WAGE COUNTRIES EXCEPT IN HIS SUPERIOR ENTERPRISE AND GREATER ADAPTABILITY AS FARMERS THE JAPANESE EXCEL THE LESSONS LEARNED AT HOME ARE APPLIED HERE AND THE LAND IS MADE TO PRODUCE CROPS NOT WEEDS NO SLIPSHOD METHODS ARE FOLLOWED AND AMERICANS MAY BENEFICIALLY APPLY THE LESSON THEY MAY LEARN OF JAPANESE FARMERS EDUCATION A VERY CONSIDERABLE PERCENTAGE OF JAPANESE LABORERS ARE STU DENTS EAGER TO LEARN WHEN THEY ACQUIRE ENGLISH AND READ IT THEIR LEISURE IS EMPLOYED IN READING OUR WORKS ON HISTORY BIOGRAPHY AND SCIENCE THIS TENDENCY IS NOT OBSERVED IN OTHER IMMIGRANTS THEY LABORIOUSLY WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL GRADES AND UNIVERSITIES BY FARM LABOR OR DOMESTIC SERVICE OF THEIR QUALITIES AS STUDENTS THE FOLLOWING OPINION IS GIVEN BY ONE OF THE OLDEST PUBLIC SCHOOL PRINCIPALS IN SAN FRANCISCO I I HAVE HAD AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES IN OVER TWENTY YEARS EXPERIENCE WITH JAPANESE STUDENTS TO KNOW WHEREOF I SPEAK IN ALL ITS BEARINGS 2 NO CONSIDERABLE PART OF THESE STUDENTS ARE ADULTS HAD THE ADULT PUPILS EVER REACHED AS LARGE A PROPORTION AS TWENTY PER CENT THERE WOULD YEARS AGO HAVE BEEN PROTESTS FROM TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS AND JAPANESE ADULTS COULD AND WOULD HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM ELEMENTARY DAY SCHOOLS JUST AS ARE OTHER ADULTS WITHOUT FRICTION OR OBJECTION 3 JAPANESE STUDENTS DO NOT CROWD WHITE CHILDREN OUT OF THE SCHOOLS THE SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS ARE NOT OVERCROWDED THEY NEVER HAVE BEEN OVERCROWDED DURING THE PAST TWENTY YEARS EXCEPT IN A FEW SPOTS AND THAT FOR CAUSES ENTIRELY OUTSIDE THIS MATTER 4 THE STATEMENT THAT THE INFLUENCE OF THE JAPANESE IN OUR SCHOOLS HAS HAD A TENDENCY TOWARDS IMMORALITY IS FALSE AND ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT FOUNDATION FROM ALL I HAVE EVER HEARD IN CONFERENCE WITH OTHER SCHOOL MEN AS WELL AS FROM MY OWN CONTINUOUS AND CAREFUL OBSERVATION THERE HAS NEVER BEEN THE SLIGHTEST CAUSE FOR A SHADOW OF SUSPICION AFFECTING THE CONDUCT OF ONE OF THESE JAPANESE PUPILS ON THE CONTRARY I HAVE FOUND THAT THEY HAVE FURNISHED EXAMPLES OF INDUSTRY PATIENCE UNOBTRUSIVENESS OBEDIENCE AND HONESTY IN THEIR WORK WHICH HAVE GREATLY HELPED MANY EFFICIENT TEACHERS TO CREATE THE PROPER MORAL ATMOSPHERE IN THEIR CLASS ROOMS 5 JAPANESE AND AMERICAN CHILDREN HAVE BEEN ON GOOD TERMS IN MY CLASS ROOMS AND IN OTHERS CONCERNING WHICH I AM INFORMED THEY WORK 298 78REASONS FOR ENCOURAGING JAPANESE IMMIGRATION SIDE BY SIDE WITHOUT INTERFERENCE OR FRICTION AND OFTEN SOME JAPANESE STUDENT WOULD BE A GREAT FAVORITE AMONG HIS AMERICAN CLASSMATES 6 IN ALL MY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE THERE HAS NEVER COME TO ME ORALLY OR IN WRITING FROM THE PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN HAVE ATTENDED MY SCHOOL ONE HINT OF COMPLAINT OR DISSATISFACTION CONCERNING THE INSTRUCTION OF THEIR CHIL DREN IN THE SAME SCHOOL OR THE SAME ROOMS WITH JAPANESE NOR HAS THERE EVER BEEN COMPLAINT OR PROTEST FROM TEACHERS IN REGARD TO THIS COEDUCATION INTERNATIONAL ETHICS TO INCLUDE JAPANESE IN THE CHINESE EXCLUSION LAWS WILL RAISE GRAVE INTERNATIONAL ISSUES JAPAN HAS ADOPTED WESTERN CIVILIZATION AND HER CIVIL INSTITUTIONS ARE TEMPERED BY THE PARLIAMENTARY SYSTEM HER JURISPRUDENCE IS BASED ON THE COMMON LAW AND CONFORMS TO THE ENGLISH STANDARD WHICH IS THE FOUNDATION OF OURS IN SCIENCE SHE HAS IMPRESSED THE WORLD BY THE RESULTS OF ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION THE WORLD NOW HAS THE MEANS OF ESCAPE FROM BUBONIC PLAGUE BE CAUSE THE JAPANESE BACTERIOLOGIST KITTESATO DISCOVERED THE PLAGUE GERM REVEALED ITS BIOLOGICAL PROGRESS AND THE MEANS OF ITS TRANS MISSION FROM RODENT TO MAN ANOTHER JAPANESE BACTERIOLOGIST ISOLATED THE DYSENTERY MICROBE AND CAUSED A REDUCTION OF FIFTY PER CENT IN THE MORTALITY FROM THAT SCOURGE OF ARMIES THE WORLD CANNOT SET THE SEAL OF INFERIORITY UPON A NATION THAT HAS FURNISHED SUCH MEN NOR CAN IT AFFORD TO JUDGE JAPANESE BY THE CLASSES THAT ARE LOWEST IN THE SCALE JAPANESE FRIENDSHIP FOR AMERICA IS OF UNDOUBTED SINCERITY WHEN SAN FRANCISCO WAS DESTROYED BY EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE AND HER PEOPLE WERE IN EXTREMITY LACKING FOOD AND SHELTER JAPAN SENT FOR THEIR RELIEF 245OOO THE ONLY FOREIGN NATION THAT CAME TO THEIR RESCUE THOUGH FRANCE HAS RECENTLY SENT A MEDAL JAPANESE BUSINESS MEN AND FINANCIERS RESIDENT HERE ARE IN EVERY WAY ACCEPTABLE THEIR HOME LIFE IS CHARACTERIZED BY REFINEMENT AND GOOD TASTE THEIR WIVES ARE LADIES MANY OF THEM COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO UNDERSTAND AND OBSERVE THE SOCIAL CONVENTIONS THE PRESENCE OF THIS COMMERCIAL AND FINANCIAL CLASS IS NECESSARY TO OUR TRADE WITH JAPAN IT IS THE DESTINY OF THAT COUNTRY TO BECOME TO ASIA WHAT ENGLAND IS TO THE WESTERN WORLD AND TO DRAW UPON EXPORTS FROM THE UNITED STATES TO AN EQUAL DEGREE EVERY CONSIDERATION SEEMS TO COUNSEL A POLICY OF PEACE GOOD WILL AND EQUALITY OF TREATMENT TOWARD JAPAN IN THE CASE OF THE JAPANESE THERE IS NO ROOM FOR RACE PREJUDICE BUT EVERY INDUCEMENT TO A POLICY OF JUSTICE AND AMITY 299 79

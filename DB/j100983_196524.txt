enterprise towards the nortlh Encouragement to explore a region invested with nmys tery and romance was found in the fact that great currenits both in in the sea and the air were ready to serve as guides and help them on their way Nature appears partial towards the north as the equator of heat is bv no means coincident with the equatorial line In portions of the Pacific the equator of heat

latitudes imian acts in sympathy with the inightiest forces of nature The magnetic needle pointing steadfastly towards the niorth is the index of his mind This joint tendency of nature and man is prophetic and tells of a triumphanit result When or under what circumstances the Iirst arctic v6yage was made is not now knownl At the dawn of history the northern regions were represented as the realm of perpetual night There upon the border of a vast sea the Cimmerians dwelt in the congenial gloom their habits f orminig the theme of grotesque fables The earliest maps however show the polar regions as occuLpied by a watery waste while there are few statements that come to us from that early period which are more definite than that of Seymnus of Clio who floutrished about 900 years B C and who says in hiis Fragments that at the extremnity of the Celts is a boreal peak  it is very high and sends ouit a cape into a stormy sea Letronne thinks that rAi7 is a poetical expression

de Scymiinus de Clio c By M Letronne p 66160 Arctic Exploration The earliest voyage to the north is that claimed for Pytheus the distinguished Phenician astronomer anid geographer of MIIar seilles who flourished 320 B C His works were extant in the fifth century but are no longer fouind Pliny and Eratosthenes gave full credit to his inarrations though Strabo shows great hostility to Pytheus whose accounits he refused to receive saying that he made use of his acquaintance with astronomy and mathemnaties to fabricate his false narrative Pliny however with more reason thought that he employed his knowledge in practical exploration The latest editor of Strabo does not share in his authors doubt According to Pliny aiid others Pytheus sailed throuigh the Straits of Gibraltar making his way north to the British isles whither it was the custom of his countrymnen to resort and after traveling over England on foot proceeded northward to a place called  Thule six dlays sail from the northern part of Britaint Strabo points out serious errors in his account of England but the errors in the main may be attribuited to transcribers by whom Timeus is miade to call Vectis the Isle of Wight  Mictis and put it at six days sail from Britain In Plinys time those regions were well kniown and he speaks of  writers who make mention of somie other islandsScandia namnely Duinna Bergos and greater than all Neri gos from which persons embark for Thuile At one days sail from  Strabo B VII c 3 1 t Pliny Nat Hist B II c 75 and B IV c 13 30 36 Strabo saYs It is true that Pytheus of Marseilles affirms thiat the farthest countrvy north of the Britislh islands is Thule for which he says the summnner tropic and the arctic circle is all one But he records no other particulars concerning it whether Thule is an island or whether it continues habitable up to the point where the summer tropic becomnes one with the arctic circle B II c v 8 Strabos editor says on this that the summer tropic beinig placed at 24 degrees from the equator by Strabo and most probably by Pytheus the latitude of Thule or Iceland would be fixed at 66 N which corresponds with the north of Iceland where the two tropics would join and becorne ones To the forego ing nmay be alded another criticism on Strabo which has an effect opposite to tllat intended as the  inarine sponge is nothing but the soft ice which forms in the north It is likewise he who describes Thule and other neighboring places where accord ing to him neither earth water nor air exists separately but a sort of concretion of all these resembling marinie sponge in which the earth the sea and all tllings were suspended thus forming as it were a link to unite the whole together It can neither he traveled over nor sailed through Book It c iv  1Arctic Exploration 161 Thule he adds is the frozen ocean which by some is called the Cronian sea There has been a division of opinion respecting the locality of the place forming the point of departure for Thule or Iceland By some Scanidia is identified with Scandinavia Bergos with the modern Bergen and Nerigos as the northern part of Norway though Gos selin is of the opinion that Bergos refers to the Scottish island of Barra and Nerigos to one of the northern promontories called Nery Hlowever this may be it is evident that in the time of Pliny and long before there were those who knew of the island of Iceland whieh was reached either from the Orkneys or from the coast of Norway We incline strongly to the latter opinion as Bergen in Norway fiom time immemorial has been a point of de paituire for Iceland WVhile the classic geographer knew much about the north itis also reasonable to infer that the waters of the sea towards New Found lauid had been freqiiweuted by Europeans engaged in thefisheries and that by legrees they sailed to the coasts of Greenland and America It is true that Iceland appears to have been generally unknown to the Scandinavians until the year 864 but the people of Great Britain were well acquiainted with that lonely isle long before The earliest known movemenit northward from England was that inauiguir atel by Wing Arthuir about the year 505 Theauthority on this subject is Geoffrey of Monmouth who was bishop of Saiint Asapli in 1152 and who wrote the H1istoria6 Britonitm a work which afforded a basis for the fables and romances of the  Knights of the Round Table Nevertheless whoever inclines to turn from all the statements of Geoffrey for the reason that they contain much that is unitrue shlouild ponder the wellconsidered words of Hume who says of the Prince of Silures  This is that Authur so much cele brated in the songs of Thaliessin and the other British bards and whose military achievements have been blended with so many fables as even to give occasion for entertaining a doubt of his real existence But poets he continues  thouigh they disfigure the most certain history of their fictions and use strange liberties with truth where they are the sole historians as among the Britons have commonly  Pliny B IV c 3016 Aretie Eepirav70fttho2 some foundationi for their wildest exaggerations  The Bishop of Saint Asaph who was niot a poet may be credited therefore when he states such simple facts as that abouit the year 505 King Arthur after the conquest of Ireland received the submission of the Orknieys and sailed to Iceland which he also subdued at a subse quent period overcoming his foes in Norwayt The conquiest of Ireland cost much bloodshed but that of Iceland if he went there muist have been made withouit a struggle since at that period there could not have been men enough to make any great resistaneet Hakluyt treating this matter qulotes from Galfridus Monulme tensis who says that after suibduiing Ireland Arthur went to Iceland and  brouight it and the people thereof under his subjec tion The same author mentions  Malniasius as King of Iceland and tells of soldiers that he furnishedl The King however may be redueed to a figure of speech while there could have been no soldiers untiless indeed Arthur as elsewhere stated transported people to the north Hakluyt also quotes Lambord to the effect that Arthuir made his way to Greenland  1 but we can understand how the statement originated since the map of Ptolemy miade Greenland a western extension of Norway the position of the country being misunderstood It was very easy therefore for modern chroniclers to suppose that Arthur took Greenland on his way in his expedition to Norway hence this error Waurin who wrote in the 14th centuiry before the influence of Ptolemys maps was generally felt does not mention Greenland though he says that Arthur carried the war into Iceland and fought with the Icelanders whom he brought into subjection Geoffrey of Monmouth does not allude to Greenland Neverthe less he is our authority for the statement that Arthur went to  Humes England I p 38 Ed 1822 t Geoffreys History B IX c 10 4 In

possible that the Bishop of St Asaph inferred that the northern island visited was Iceland and it is also possible that in such a case he may have been in error  but this treatment of his statement is not required That Arthur could have sailed to Iceland adlmits of no doubt nor is there any reason for holding that there were no inhabitants there in 505 The fact that the Northmen found only a few monks in Iceland in 864 does not prove that the same was true 250 years earlier Bede who died in 725 knew of Icelad   and the Prologue of the Landnamabok speaks of both Irish and English books fouind there when the Northmen arrivedt Dicuil teaches that monks were in Iceland in 795  for writing in 8925 he says that thirty years had passed since sonme clerks clerici who had dwelt in the island told him certain things He also says that those who in their writings had described Iceland as sur rounded by a sea of ice were quite wrong and he proves the truth of his own accouint by the testimony of  clerks who had voyaged to this island He admits however that in voyages to the north of Iceland they lhave fouind the sea frozen t Dicuil also testifies that there are numerous islands two days and two nights to the north of Britain and that a  Religious worthy of faith told him of a visit made by him in a small boat to one of these islands which nearly a hundred years before was inhabited by Eremites from Scotland But Dicuil says that these regions were abandoned on account of the ravages of the northern pirates who were as innumerable as  the birds of the sea Thus it appears that Iceland was well known to the people of the British isles long before it was inhabited by men from Norway and we can readily understand how the population that probably existed in Arthurs time may have been reduced by piratical incursions until in 864 the Norwegians found only a few anchoretes dwelling there The narrative of Geoffrey of Monmouth is ther efore perfectly consistent with known facts and the expedition of Arthur to Iceland may be regarded as historic It is now apparent that in the century before Dicuil dated his  Antiquitates Americanse p 202 t Ibid 205 De menua Orbis Terrae Letronnes Ed p 38 t Ibid164 Arctic kiEplooqwtwovn book the British islands were in communrication and chiefly through the medium of the monks who as is well known were bold and skillful sailors pushing far out to sea in boats of wicker or hide How long this comnmunication was kept up by them cannot now be determined It is probable that it was inever suspended The AngloSaxon map of the tenth century shows that the sailors and geographers of England were acquiainted with the Northern sea TheAnglo Saxon Map Beyond Iceland was the open sea into which Dicuils iniformants the Religious whom he styles  clerks had so boldly sailed until they reached the barrier of ice which bars the course of the explorer today We have already seen that Arthur did not visit Greenland yet that that part of the north was reached about the time of Arthur admits of little doubt It is true that the discovery of Greenland has generally been assigned to the period of Eric the Red who wenit to Greenland in 985 yet a Bull of Pope Gregory IV dated 770 refers to Greenland The genuineness of this Bull cannot be ques tioned nor is there any reason to suppose that the reference to Greenland was interpolated The Bollandists may indeed think that there is some mistake but the explanation is easy and natural  This is a matter of private informiation but the author cannot learn that theA retic Eploratfoqm 1 65 when we take into consideration the known activity of maritime eniterprise prior to Eric the Red Indleed the Irelandic chronicles distinctly say that half a century before the voyage of Eric a great country was known at the west being called  Ireland the Great It would seem that this country was first reached by the Irish whose prior discovery was conceded by the Icelanders The Irish had described it evidentlyv as a land of verdure while the Saga says that Eric applied the name of  Greenland  to the part he visited not from any fitness b1ut from motives of policy saying that  men would be persuaded to go to a land with so good a name It is no where pretended that the name  Greenland  originated with Eric His own account indicates that Europeans had visited Greenland before his time which leads to the conclusion that the Irish had been in the cotintry and that the reference to Greenland in the Bull of 770 is correct In the yeai1 1187 Giraldus Cambrensis wrote his Thpoographiac ZIibernica and in this work he speaks of Iceland which is described as a great island three days sail northward from Ireland The people are represenited as of few words but truithful Giraldus shows that he understood something of the naturi e of their govern ment in saying that their priests were their kingst Approaching the thirteenth century the age appears to be one of maritime activity Necker Abbott of Cirencester who died in 1217 Bollandists have any acquaintance with the general subject which woultl give weight to any opinion they might entertain  On this point see  PreColumbian Discovery of

stane showing that those things were familiar to navigators Here there fore it will be necessary to introduce Nicholas of Lynn who in 1360 made a voyage to the high north But before attempting the particular consideration whch seems to be required it will be neces sary to glance at the condition of northern maritime enterprise dur ing the fourteenth and fifteenth centuiries In the fouirteetnth cen tliry the fisheries were commonly puirsued around Iceland whose people were in regular communication with Greenland he Eng lish also mnust have known of Greenland at the time though in common with the people of Iceland and Norway they did not appre ciate the importance of this knowledge In the fourteenth century proof is fouind both in the Icelandic and English annals of the con nection between the two countries The Icelandic contains indica tions of the arrival of English ships but it is clear that their corning was so well known as to gain only a casuial allusion the interest standing connected with the news brought The entries were made at the time having since been extracted from the numerous writings for the convenience of stuidents and set down in chronological order in the langutage of the original Let us therefore notice these entr ies In 1348 news reached Iceland that in England the mortality was so great that 200000 persons had diedt The next year the death of English sailors at Bergen in Norway opposite Iceland was r eported and recorded in the Sagas1 This is all that we find at present in conniection witlh the foturteenth century in Iceland but the reference ol the Saga to the great mortality in England is confirmed by Stows  Annales which state that the plague reached England in 1348 touching the seaports first Thence no doubt the news was at once carried by fishermen to Iceland If the voyages of the  Bulletin de Geographie 1858 p 177 Are Frode in 1068 speaking of the visit paid to Iceland by Floke Vilgerderson says that in those times seamen had no loadstone in the northern countries The Bible Guyot 1150 speaks of the loadstone as  un pierre laida et brnimiere t Islenzkir Annalar  Hafnia 1847 p 276 The Icelandic is as follows

been some more definite notice in the Sagas We are free however to admit that early in this century the merchant trade may have been small as in 1328 Edward III does not mention Iceland in his Pro Pfereatoribus Extraneis Nor does he mention Denmark or Norway but these are incluided in the geineral language  omniurn aliarcm Yerrarxun et locorum extranorurnt Nevertheless the mandate of Edward III dated March 18th 1354 recognizes the fact that the king maintained a fleet for service in the  parts Boreal John de Haddon being the Admiralt It was probably designed to protect the fishermen and merchants from pirates arouind the north of Britain In the Icelandie annals of the fifteenth century the first entry is that of 1407 when news was received of the death of the Arch bishop of Yorkt In 1412 it was recorded that five English sailors had separated from their ship and wintered in the islandg In 1413  thirty more fislhing vessels came from England Some of them were blown to the northern part of Iceland and possibly to the Greenland coast11 In 1415 six Englislh ships sailed to Iceland and made their port in the Westmann Islands In 1416 six ships anchored in Hafnafiord in the southwest of Iceland In 1419 many English ships were wrecked on the coast of Iceland and a large number of lives were losttt The annals in the present compilation end with the year 1430 and these six entries are all that we find If carefuilly con sidered however it will appear that these mentions really form men orabilia This will be seen by turning to the English annals for the corresponding period The first reference to Iceland in the Facera is that of 1415 when Henry V for the satisfaction of the King of Denmark ordered that during the year none of his sub jects should presume to visit any of  the coasts of the islands be longing to Denmark and Norway and especially to the island of Iceland for the purpose of fishing or trading  otherwise than according to the ancient custom aliter quam

authorities of the various seapoirts of England the mayor and bailiff of Lynn Norfolk being notified with the rest Here tben we learn in connection with 1415 that in the ancient times voyages to Iceland had become fre quenit It is clear from the complaint of the Danish king that the old rules respecting traffic had been broken habitually and that they were now to be observed at least for one year Of the exact natur e of the ancient law we cannot speak but it would appear as though tne prohibition related to the shore fisheries which they were ilot to intruide uipon and hence when the English went to Iceland in 1415 they harbored off the coast at the Westmann Islands The arrival of the shiips under the circumnstances formed a noticeable event and for this reason it was recorded The Icelandic Annals add immediately after mentioning their arrival that  the ships brought letters from the King of England to the people and the chief men of Iceland to the effect that license should be accorded to traiisact b1usiness and especially that relating to the kings own ship The Annals state that the matter was duly arranged It will be noticed too that one of these ships belonged to the King of England It was evidently a cruiser of the royal navy There is then a complete agreement between the English and the Icelaridic Annals both showing that an English fleet visited Iceland in 1415a circumstance which should go very far to establish the general value and credibility of those records of a distant aget In 1416 the Eniglish were again in Iceland but the Fcdera does niot mention voyages until 1436 when Henry VI issued a license to John the Icelandic Bishop of Holem then in London authoiiziing him to engage John May with his ship  Catherine for a voyage to Icelaiid where May evidently an old voyager was to act as his attorney and transact certain business for himn the Bishop himself not wishing to undertake the voyage1 In 1436 Richard Weston of London a stockfishmonger was well known by the Icelanders  Federa ix 322 f This agreement between the English and Icelandic authorities appears to be pointed ouit now for the first time  Fcedera x 645 and 659

that without this aid from England the sacraments even would be omitted there being neither wine nor salt in the country and only nlilk and water laco et aquarm In connection with the year 1445 another voyage is indicated by the Admiralty Black Book action having been taken against Wil liam Byggeman and two men of Lynn who visited Iceland in a  dogger called the  Trinity and kidnapped a boy whomn they brought to Swetesham and held in servitude contrary to law t In 1450 a treaty was made between the Kings of Denimark and England which prohibited trading in Iceland but a special provi sion of Parliament exempted Thomas Canynges Mayor of Bristol froin the prohibition in consideration of his great services to Iceland He was accordingly allowed to send two ships thither to load with fish or other comimodities His trade with Iceland was a matter of general knowledge and throws additional light upon a certain remark by Columbus To avoid interrupting the course of the narrative respecting Ice land alluisioti to the voyage of the Zeno Brothers was omitted in its proper chronological place This voyage was made to Green land and a part of the American coast called Estotiland and Drogeo but it is not desirable to dwell upon such a familiar theme here It suffices to say whatever may be the obscurity of portions of the narrativet hat its authenticity never would have been questioned if it had been understood that at the time the voyage was made the seas at the north and west were well known and frequented of which fact anmple proof has Inow been given The Zeno Map pub

sources among which may be ineentionted the voyages to the west of Ireland so well known to Columbus as his biography proves Yet enough has been said to show the real character of the period in which Nicholas of Lynin flourished Trhe times both before anid after the general date assigned to his voyages were marked by great activity and expeditions to the north were so common that neither the English nor the Icelanders took the trouble to mention them except when they stood connected with circumstances of particular interest The intercourse between Iceland and England was so frequent that sailors like John May who served as the representative of the Bishop of IHolem must have acquired a fair knowledge of the language spoken in that distant isle Indeed at one time under the Normanis the Icelandic tongue gave a person the advantage at the courts of both England and Francet But enough has been said to prove that the voyage of Nicholas of Lynnl in 1360 formed no novelty It was the alleged circulm stances attending his voyage that rescued his name from oblivionj His actions take their place with entire naturalness in the annals of his age there being nothing in the nature of the voyage towards the Pole to challenge belief But it will be proper lhere to speak of Nicholas himself Quaint Andrew Fuller in his WTorthies of England says that ino county  doth carry a top and gallant

hap pened while he was a student and before he had acquired the char acter of a reverent clerke It would appear tbat like Chaucer himself Nicholas was in favor with the famous Duke of Lan caster Heilbronner says that Nicholas flourished about the year 1355 and that he  ended life  a cenobite but what portion of his life was spent at sea does not appear It is possible that he went to the north with the Norfolk fleet and it would seem that he was a practical navigator However long he may have folloWed the sea he at last found grateful repose within the cloisters of his convent devoting his days to science and religion His voyage must have been made from the port of his native town called Lynn Regis The town was one of great antiquity having received its first charter from King John this being followed by no less than eleven others all of which with their seals are still carefully preserved At a very early period Lynn was an important seaport It contained various convents and churches The latter in connec tion with numerous crumbling antiquities render Lynn a place of very great iinteiest The thoughts of the people like the air of the town itself were full of the ocean breeze and even the monk in his cell felt many of those subtle influences which pervade the maritime provinces and invite men to wander abroad In the case of Nich olas duty may have united with natural inclination in alluring him away upon unknown seas At all events he became a sailor and as Cbhaucer writes  With many a tempest hadde his berd be shake Thus he won his place as a mariner in the annals of his time Two works have been attributed to Nicholas of Lynn the Inven tio Fortunata a copy of which he presented to Edward III and an astroinomical Kalendar adapted more or less to practical naviga tion The latter is still preserved and its contents are indicated by Bale It treats of the length of the days the oppositions and con junctions of planets and gives a table of eclipses calculated for 75 years together with a description of astronomical instruments  Kalendariurn indicans rerum locum Solis quantitatem dierum artificialiumn et vulgarium oppositiones et conjunctionis planetarum c cum

be found It is possible that if a copy were discovered it would add little to his fame It may have appeared in print at the end of the fifteenth century though no mention of its publica tion has been pointed out Its disappearance under any circum stances is not a matter of surprise since of many importanit works once well known no copy remains today while of others there are only one or two examples Unfortunately we know almost as little about the voyages made from Lynn by the fellow townsmen of Nicholas as about the book in question Many hardy mariners sailed fromn the port of Lynn but of their enterprise at the north only the most scanty memorials remain It is nevertheless clear that their activity was appreciated by Edward III while their neighbors of Blakeney were several timnes favored by that king on account of their superior merit But while mention has been found of no particular inorthern voyage from Lynn we must not forget the fact already stated that in 1415 the people of that place were ordered to make no voyage to Iceland except in accordance with the rules observed in ancient times Pos sibly therefore one of the five ships reported at the ilorth in 1415 was from Lynn It may also be noticed that in the ancient manuscript records of Lynn there is a reference to armour for the use of the  North Fleett on ptage 59 of the MS says  Hoc Kalendarium fecit Nicholaus

There is one curious thing to be mentioned namely that on certain mnaps of the Orcades and notably on Blacks Atlas some rocks are laid down north of Ronaldsha as  Altars of Lina In an old folio on the Or cades there is the following  The Altars of Linay reach above quarter of a mile from the shore and are visible with low spring tide Thus far however it has been impossible to discover any tradition in connection with these rocks though it may perhaps be admissible to suppose that in voyaging northward Nicholas was accustomed to stop at the Orcades and that in some way his name became connected with these rocks which formerly must have risen high above the sea presenting a marked appearance suggestive of altarst Among the manuscripts of Sir Thomas Hare at Stow Hall is one which under date of March 16th 1337 mentions a ship at Lynn called  The Petre Edmund Ferrers of Wygendale being Lynn writes As to Nicholas of Lynn I beg to inform you that I do not find any mentiorn of him in the Lynn

have used both Hartlepool and New castleuponTyne as naval stations t the latter being not far from Lynn while the former situated on the coast of Durham afforded a most convenient base for operations towards Iceland whither as we have seen one of the kings ships went with a trading fleet in 1415 In the fourteenth century Ranulfus Higden wrote his well known Polychronicon but though a contemporary of Lynn he makes no reference to his voyage Higden died about the year 1363 while the voyage of Nichlolas is set down for 1360 The early part of the Ranilfus Higdens Map AD 1360 work where the reference to Nicholas would belong was probably composed some time before his death and possibly prior to 1360 Hig den therefore may have known of Lynn and his voyage though he fails to mention him

Commission 1872 p 251 f Fcedera v 778178 Arctic Exploration The earliest allusions to the Jnveutio Foitunata of Lynn is found upon the margin of a map by John Ruysch which appeared at Rome in the Ptolemy of 1508 On this map is a legend somewhat to the following effect  It is written in the Book of the For tunate Discovery that under the Arctic Pole there is a high mag netic rock 33 German miles in circulmference This is surrounded by the fluid sugenum sea that as a vase pours out water by four mouths from below Around are islands of which two are inhabited Mountains vast and wide surrouind these islands 24 of which deny habitation to man This would seem to indicate that the book written by Nicholas of Lynn was known to the mapmaker while also it may have been known at Rome It is evident that the polar region was drawn more or less in accor dance witli sorne plan by Nicholas which was combined with later material Around the magnetic rock immedi ately under the pole are four islands  Aronphei  Insvla deserta Hyperborei Evropa and  Insvle Deserta Ouitside of these islands are smaller and mountainous islands arranged in a semicircle while the peninsula of Pilapelanti with

without resemblance to what is found in natuire for what is called the polar basin is fed by several vast streams pouring into it from the warm regions at the south These streams also create counter

all be founded upon what is observed today in connection with the Gulf Stream and the Kuro Ciro and may be connected with the observations of such navigators as Pytheas who went to the north The magnetic rock under the pole on the map of Ruiysch or rather we may perhaps say of Nicholas deserves attention as it has been claimed that the monk had applied his mind to one of the most difficult of problems and that the magnetic mountain stands for the solution thereof The attention of Humboldt does not appear to have been drawn to Nicholas but in treating the history of the magInet the great investigator calls attention to the fact that  on the remarkable chart of America appended to the edition of the Geograplhy of Ptolemy published at Rome in 1508 we find the magnetic pole marked as an insular mountain north of Grventlant In 1545 Martin Cortez placed the magnetic pole further south as did Sanuto in 1588 That Nicholas entertained fanciful notions is not at all strange Sanuto held that if men were ever so fortunate as to reach the magnetic pole they would experience some miraculous effect Columbuis likewise was fuill of curious fancies holding for instance that west of the Azores ships sailed up hill towards the unapproach able Paradiset It would have been a happy thing if the false notions of Nicholas of Lynn had not misled others First however it must be indicated that the magnetic mountain of Lynn was bor rowed from the early philosophers and geographers Galen reports magnetic rocks on the coasts of the Indian ocean and St Ambrose echoes the idea  while the

Ptolemy and accordingly created one It was partially suggested as hypothetical Of the extent of his actual knowledge in connection with polar mag netism it is impossible to speak It will be necessary however to notice the blunder into which the map of Ruysch led Humboldt who contrary to his uisual custom hastily accepted a suggestioni found in Biddles Life of Cabot Mr Biddle in seeking to exalt his hero dwells upon what Cabot ob served in connection with the variation of the compass and says that his earliest transatlantic voyage carried him  to the very quar ter where it is exhibited in a manner so sudden and striking that modern navigators seem to concur in placing there one of the mag netic poles As respects the locality of the voyage in question however there is much doubt the socalled map of Cabot being no authority on the subject Mr Biddle nevertheless continues  There is a curious piece of evidence to show how early the north ern region discovered by Cabot was associated with the alarm which this phenomenon the variation must in the first instance have excited adding On the great map of the world which accom panies the edition of Ptolemy published at Rome in 1508 is the fol lowing inscription which he gives in Latin but which is Englished as follows  Here the ships compass loses its property and no ves sel with iron on board is able to get awayt On this the

matter for this edition of Ptolemy professes to have a knowledge of the discoveries made by Columbus by the Portuguese and by the English He also refers to Fournier who says that Cabot marked exactly in various places the dipping of the needle Humboldt in noticing this says that Biddle observes withl justice that a remark inscribed oln the Mappemonde of Ptolemy  appears founded oii the ideas of Cabot relative to the position and proximity of the magnetic polet Nevertheless a more careful ex amination of the general subject in connection with Nicholas of Lynn would have shown Humboldt that there was no reference whatever in the legend to the discoveries of Cabot but that the reference was to the teaching contained in the monks Irventio Fortunati itself an echo of Ptolemy and the ancients Biddle says that the inscription appears  far beyond terra nrova while Huin boldt loosely says before or near pres New Foundland Both are quite wrong as the legend stands north of Greenland and Ice land at the entrance of the polar sea evidently being placed there for the reason that there was not sufficient room nearer the magnetic mountain Humboldt by the aid of Mr Biddle simply fell into a hlunder confusing a monastic hypothesis with the suipposed record of an actual observation by Cabot This error does not appear to have been noticed hitherto The arrangement of the land and water around the pole on Riiyschs map is conventional and it may be questioned whether the great peninsula called  Grvenlant was a part of Lynns plan At all events he had ample opportunities of

Exploration landers were still well informned respectinig that country Indeed there is good reason for supposing that the map of Ruysch shows less knowledge of Greenland than Nicholas possessed as the

the map of Orontius Fine of the year 153 1 which shows the influence of Nicholas as exerted by Ruysch for there is no evidence at hand proving that Fine had seen the book called In verntio Fortunata

trace of Nicholas the monk of Lynn is found in the work of Las Casas written in 155261 where he speaks of floating islands and refers to those of Northern Italy mentioned by Pliny and where he also

The text runs as follows Juventius Fortunatus relates that there is an account of two islands towards the west and a little southward than the island of Cape Verde which skim along upon the water Now if we are correct the writer here alludes to the Inventio lortunata of Nicholas of Lynn though the editor of the Life of the Admiral whoever he may have been makes the title of the book itself the name of the author It is indeed possible that such a person as  Juventus Fortunatus  wrote on geographical subjects and hence was quoted but the probabilities are against this view At all events no such work now exists in the Colombina Library at Seville where we should expect to finid it for the reason that the library in question is none other than the library of Ferdi nand Columbus the reputed author of the Life of the Admiral Nor does this library contain the Inventio Fortunata of Nicholas which constitutes another argument such as it is to prove that Fer dinand did not write the book attributed to him or at least that he did not compose the work in its present form The catalogue of the Colombina has been searched diligently for some indication of such work but in vaint An

all these accounts there is however nothing to impugn the gen eral statemnent respecting the voyage of Nicholas into the far North If correctly reported he may have fancied that he knew all about the Pole and that he had solved the problem of the magnet by putting one of the old magnetic mountains in the north If he was deceived it may be said that he was not the first navigator who indulged ilnag ination at the expense of truth He is made to say that great tides drew ships into a fatal gulf but if this is used to prove that he never saw the north then the stories of the Norwegian sailors respecting the Maelstrom found until recently on many maps would indicate that after all they also never saw the sea In the early times what havoc could not the cosmographer have made of the statement of Davis who saw the northern sea falling down into the gulf with a mighty overfall 9 What is needed is the narrative of Nicholas which be presented to Edward III This may yet be drawn forth from some musty and forgotten collection In closing we may pause to inquire how far north the ancient navigators penetrated The Icelandic colonists in Greenland may have reached a very high latitude during the three hundred years that they visited there but the highest point indicated is that near Cape York in 720 N Upon an unpublished Spanish globe in the National Library at Paris of the date of about 1540 is an indication which possibly may prove that some navigator had pushed through Srhiths sound and Robeson channel Many unre corded expeditions were doubtless made into the north and this globe may contain the memorial of some French Spanish or Portu giiese voyage not far from the year 1500 In 1500 and in 1501 expeditions went north under Contereal who also went in 1502 never to return On the east coast of Greenland so far as our knowledge goes exploration was not carried high up though190 Arctic Exploration Columbuis in going three hundred miles beyond Iceland must have sailed close to the northern border of Greenland If he had perse vered he would have struck the New World in 1477 IJhe early navigators appear to have pushed northward to the pack ice but there is no indication of their having known either Jan Mayen or Franz Josephs Land though they may have seen both The map of the Zeno Brothers the resuilt of the voyage of 1380 stood un equalled down to 1558 no improvement in the cartology of Green land being made until the voyage of John Davis in 1585 The results of his observations in Greenland were indicated by Molyneux on his globe of 1592 and on his map of 1600 which was engraved by Wright being projected on the plan attributed to Mercator The map of 1600 appears to be the one referred to by Shakespeare in Tweefth Xight as  the new map with the augmentation of the Indies In 1511 the Lenox Globe showed an open sea arouind the pole and in 1529 the Verrazano Map left the sea still open though in the antaratic region a great continent was beginning to appear south of Cape Horn Ilerein was the partial representationi of a classic myth On Mercators map of 1569 the antarctic continent exults in astounding proportions Notwithstanding the great bene fits conferred upon geographical science by Mercator the know ledge of the globe in some respects was retarded in his hands owing to the weight of his reputation The northern region also was in time filled up and ever since geographers have been struggling to recover the original conception of a polar sea Shall we succeed  Of speculation on this point we have had enough and the question remains to be decided by events One thing however has become clear namely that the prospect of sailing to the pole by the way of Smiths Sound is far from enc6uraging Manifestly beyond a cer tain point the route must be pursued by sledging On the other hand the route by Beehring Straits is still to be fully tested The Jeanette under Captain de Long which last year passed within the ice belt sailing for Wrangells Land is yet to be heard from The establishment of the proposed colony at Discovery Bay in latitude 810 44 N also awaits its accomplishment When this is done as pro bably it will be done in the summer of 1881 explorers will be prepared to make fresh advanices north of Smiths Sound and thus enter seriArctic Exploration 191 ously upon the work of reaching the pole Captain Nares predicts that this can niever be done as in his judgment the ice is too rough for rapid sledging while a powerful current is continually carry ing the ice southward The opinion of so brave and skilful an officer is not to be treated lightly yet there is no proof that the current always acts as it did when Captain Markham made his great sledge journey to 830 20 N the highest point yet reached nor that the ice is always in the same rough condition that made his pro gress so slow These are points that remain to be decided by a permanent colony In that sledge journey Captain Markhams party was prostrated by scurvy the scourge of the north though a disease which a proper supply of provisions will obviate Evidently too the season passed in the north by the Nares expedition was one of unusual severity As it remained Captain Markham reached a point where the water had shoaled to 70 fathoms indicating approach ing land They turned back when only 399k miles from the pole It is nlot unreasonable to suppose that land actually exists a short dis tance north of this point If so that land may be gained and used as a base of operations for the regions beyond The question of reaching the pole is now being resolved into one of equipment while in this department something is yet to be learned The first thing to be achieved is the establishment of the permanent colony at Discovery Bay after which must follow the use of every appli ance that science and ingenuity can devise In this respect the Nares expedition was not altogether perfect Indeed no temporary expedition can meet all the conditions Permanence in operation must characterise any successful plan to reach the pole The ex plorer must be made independent of ships he must have adequate means of resisting the cold and antiscorbutics that will insura health These things are certainly possible and when secured the arctic adventurer can bide his time and await the favorable season in the meanwhile spending his time in those general observations that will prove of such incalculable scientific advantage Ilaste will form no part in that great campaign which must conduct the explorer to the pole The work will require time and the highest courage and perseverance The explorer will have no assistance from the natives beyond what he gains from those who live south of Discovery Bay That he will find as he pushes into the far192 Arctic Exploration north any  Arctic Highlander living in seclusion with herds of musk ox aild reindeer is a mere chimera Elismere Land far south of Discovery Bay appears to be the northern limit of the Eskimo Wherever man goes in that high northern region he must carry the bulk of his supplies with him as it will be found impossible to subsist by those means employed by Lieutenant Schwatka in the southward regions while engaged in the Franklin search Every thing depends upon those calculations which will enable the ex plorer to gauge his strength with exactness and maintain his con nection with the base of those supplies whichi annual relief expedi tions independently organized and maintained will furnish in un failinig abundance With a proper equipment the dangers of arctic explorations are reduced to the average of the ordinary seafaring life and experi ence proves that such work in the north can no longer be objected to oIn the ground of its risk Indeed arctic exploration may now be considered as an accepted branch of study and as a wise exten sion of the Signal Service into the realm of perpetual cold This being granted the ultimate results will take care of theinselves for with prudence courage and perseverance the dream of the middle ages will be realized and the American flag will be planted at the Pole  The portion of our paper which covered this point and showing that the Eskino were a litoralpeople driven northward from the Middle Atlantic coast has been expanded and published in the Popular Science Monthly November 1880 under the title of  The Glacial Man in America

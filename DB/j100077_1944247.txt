English con stitutional practice and in recent times has been so generously extended to colonies and dominions that it might seem an anomaly for Home Rule to be ardently desired in Ireland yet bitterly contested and thus far withheld Many favorable generally to the idea of autonomy without special reference to the condition of Ireland have believed this to result from a stubborn obstinacy and blind perverseness perpetuating in tragic fashion a tragedy of olden times But it might be sus pected that such reluctance arose in part from circumstances of a great while ago which continue or have bequeathed conse quences not to be neglected and an examination of the con troversial literature which appeared just before the war reveals many objections which in so far as they were actual and hon estly held were undoubtedly valid and potent Certainly a great many people believed that Home Rule was not only un necessary for the interests of Ireland and really to the detri ment of the Irish people but that whatever might be the results with respect to that country without doubt selfgovernment so far as it tended to separation and the erecting of an independent or hostile government would be fatal to some of the largest interests of England and the British Empire In Great Britain by 1914 there were probably few and they steeped in Toryism and ancient thought who wished Ireland 1 This article designed to exhibit some of the public opinion which character ized the Irish crisis in the years before the war is based largely upon the fleet ing and controversial literature which was so widely circulated in the British Isles then From a multitude of publications I have chosen the better ones and have attempted to expound them with discrimination and fairness Never theless it has been my purpose to display the opinions which were then taught or believed in England and Ireland rather than to give an account of my Qwn 448OPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 449 to be held down or oppressed For the most part people in England and in Scotland confessing the wrongs and errors of the past desired that fullest amends should be made that Irish men be assisted to economic prosperity and entire freedom in the ordering of their lives and that such good will be shown and assistance given that in course of time the bitter memories of the past might vanish and Ireland become a loyal member of the Empire where now she was an unwilling part But others realized that whatever were the mistakes of the past conse quences had also arisen which could not be justly ignoredhere they had reference particularly to Ulsterand that certain fundamental factors of geography and international relations potent in the past continued as important in the present and could never be neglected in the calculations of statesmen and the plans of those who made laws There was opposition to the way the measure was believedto be brought forward and also to principles which it contained Political opponents and some others asserted that the crisis developed largely because of selfish considerations of party The Liberals had attained great power when the English people desired sundry social reforms So far had the tide run and such changes had resulted from the parliament act that Mr Asquith was virtually supreme But his power was not absolute for gradually his majority had dwindled in Great Britain until the support of Irish members was needed to make his position secure His ministry now rested upon a coalition of which the lesser but indispensable part was the Nationalist votes of Ireland marshalled by Mr Redmond who was because of this ultimate dictator in the British Isles It was said that the Nationalist party was financed by supporters in America and led by a group of Irish politicians who dominated Mr Redmond that he in turn was the master of Mr Asquith and that the latter what ever his real wishes was in any event compelled to be champion of Home Rule To a considerable extent the legislation proposed had not been properly considered or debated but was being forced through450 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Of the general election in December 1910 it was said that most of the Liberal candidates never discussed Home Rule that Mr Asquith did not promise to grant it in the ensuing parliament until after twothirds of the members had been elected and that he knew he was in Mr Redmonds power According to Unionists there was No Mandate for Home Rule it was not certain that the majority of British people was willing to grant it the Liberal government was trying to smuggle the bill through without leaving it to the judgment of the people and if civil war was to be avoided there must be referendum or reference to public opinion free and deliberate In 1913 Mr Asquith maintained with reference to a bill to give votes to women that parliament should hesitate to take a step unprecedented in extent without  a full and assured conviction that it has behind it in taking that step the deliberate and considered sanction of the community and he said These are general considerations which are appli cable in greater or in less degree to any constitutional change But had the Home Rule bill any deliberate and considered sanction of the community Did You Give a Mandate Many persons had grave objection to certain principles or particular details in the prospective law especially in regard to parliamentary representation delegated powers the post office the judiciary the constabulary and numerous things about which conservative legislators are wont to entertain fear And it was said insistently that considerations of finance made the scheme objectionable or foredoomed to certain failure With Home Rule according to some financial writers Britains annual contribution to Ireland would be necessarily about 6500000 and most agreed that the yearly contribution for expenditures strictly Irish would be at least 2000000 It was predicted also that the economic effects of Home Rule would drive employers of labor out of Ireland and that to keep themselves from starving laborers would flock over to England Scotland and Wales in tens of thousands with the result that workmen in those coun tries would have lower wages and also less work Some argued that the Irish were not now suffering from the wrongs which had once oppressed them Already Ireland subOPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 451 stantially governed herself She has now precisely the same power to manage her own affairs that England Scotland and Wales enjoy In Ireland urban and rural district councils county councils and boards of guardians were chosen by pop ular election while Irish elementary and technical education fisheries agriculture congested districts and old age pensions were administered by committees manned by Irish With regard to economic amelioration the restoring of prosperity for the mass of the Irish people had been largely accomplished by the just munificence of the British government which had ap propriated huge sums of money for the purchase of the land by Irish peasants to whom money was loaned at low rate for long periods Over onehalf of Ireland said Mr Redmond in 1910 the tillers of the soil are absolute owners    In a few short years the whole of the land of Ireland will be free once and for ever of landlordism A Unionist leaflet declared that now the Irish farmer could borrow money from the state on easy terms to buy his farm paying off the price in instalments lower than his rent that the rent fixed by the state was not to be raised by the landlord that he could not be turned out of his farm so long as the rent was regularly paid that the state gave him help to improve his crops and the breed of his stock that he could now obtain a holding large enough to support his family and that the state would give assistance with stock and new buildings and even a new cottage at low rent It was not the Irish said the writer who needed further assistance but the English people in order that they might have opportunities like these Already the British government had expended 78000 000 and would probably have to expend 100000000 more Was it certain that a Home Rule government elected by debtor peasants could be depended on to pay this money back Opponents of Home Rule alleged grave objections with respect to the interests of the Irish people themselves Some of these objections concerned all the citizens of the country but others had to do particularly with the Unionist minority onethird of the population including the Protestants and especially the inhabitants of Ulster452 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW First they said that it was doubtful whether Ireland needed more selfgovernment and it was not certain that most of her people really wanted it Undoubtedly the majority of large traders and merchants the business and the professional classes the manufacturers and the bankers were opposed to it In 1910 Mr Redmond confessed that the Irish National party would have been bankrupt without contributions from America and the Reverend J OMara complained that Irishmen who en joyed benefits which would have astounded their fathers forty years earlier had not the manliness the gratitude or the patriot ism to subscribe a shilling for membership in the United Irish League Home Rule was most desired and urged most insistently by the politicians who hoped to rule Ireland after the measure was passed There would be no unrest and no agitation in Ireland for Home Rule but for agitators a writer asserted The con dition of some places now under the authority of Home Rule cor porations made it seem doubtful whether the mass of the Irish people were capable yet of giving themselves efficient govern ment The Civil Government of Dublin is a mockery even to its own people said the Daily News in 1913 If the people were mostly incapable then Irish administration no longer supervised from England would inevitably come into the keep ing of the politicians who were now at the head of powerful or ganizations like the Ancient Order of Hibernians and others allied with it It was constantly urged as a primary objection that under the domination of the leaders of these organizations the country would be in much worse condition than under a government managed or restrained by British authority At present the power behind the Irish party was the Ancient Order of Hibern ians or Molly Maguires who controlled the various parts of the United Irish League who were feared and detested by Protestants and Unionists and also by the most respectable Catholics in Ireland A pest a cruel tyranny and an organ ized system of blackguardism Cardinal Logue had called them and according to the Cork Free Press they were an organizaOPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 453 tion steeped in crime and outrage whose domination would make this country a hell A Unionist leaflet warned the British electorate that Home Rule meant really the rule of the Ancient Order In 1913 the Irish Times said During the last two years it has extended its influence into every village and town in Ireland The Order dominates Ire land now and will dominate it still more thoroughly if the Home Rule Bill becomes law and is enforced The methods employed to extend and perpetuate the greatness of these bodies it was said would be using unseen power coer cion by boycotting intimidation and destruction of property Old oppression and misrule in the island had left an evil heritage of disorder and crime It was frequently asserted that crime was decreasing and doubtless this was so but there were still numerous instances of boycotting where friends and employees were driven off by violence or threats of farms ravaged of cat tle injured of machinery and crops destroyed Wide circulation was given to The Boycotting of Richard Kingston to the instance of the aged Mrs Hall and to the story of the prolonged defiance of law in the case of Walshs Fort There were stories of brutal murder and cruel revenge of moonlighting hayburning arson And it was said that such conditions prevailed and such was the character of the Irish magistracy that either criminals were not prosecuted or the trials resulted in gross miscarriage of justice with secret societies intervening and malefactors allowed to escape It need not be thought that improvement would come with Home Rule when the police and part of the judiciary now controlled from London were delivered to the Irish them selves but rather that the situation would then be to the ad vantage of ambitious and reckless political leaders for the control of their supporters and the crushing of those who opposed them Rule of this sort would be bad for Nationalists but was it right that Loyalists should be abandoned to such tender mercy In so far as these changes would result to the detriment of the Unionists they would affect for the worse a third of the entire population of Ireland men and women who claimed as their birthright the privileges of free British citizenship concerning454 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW whom a moralist had been wont to say that he would be ashamed of his country if ever this minority were deserted With respect to most of them concentrated in northeastern Ulster particular grievances might be expected especially economic discrimina tion and the taxing of their industries to support a government founded on an agricultural constituency but in all parts of Ire land the minority might expect gradually to find schools become sectarian and their children without educational facilities courts failing to do them justice the police no longer giving adequate protection and themselves substantially debarred from public office There was finally a thing to be feared by all Unionists who were Protestants and that was the existence of an overwhelm ing majority of Catholic voters who under Home Rule would gradually but surely yield the government in large part into the hands of the church Many a warning was published to show how priests were awaiting their opportunity In 1912 according to the Irish News of Belfast the Reverend Gerald ONolan said We shall have a free hand in the future Let us use it well This is a Catholic country and if we do not govern it on Cath olic lines according to Catholic ideals and to safeguard Cath olic interests it will be all the worse for the country and all the worse for us Here it is that religion and nationality meet and may and should go handinhand Already it was said they controlled a devout and warm hearted people easily stirred to passionate hatred of the Prot estant faith Intolerance and outrage were common The operation of the decree Ne Temere denied the validity of mar riages not performed by Catholic clerics and placed marriage altogether beyond the reach of civil regulation and entirely under that of the church while the decree Motu Proprio tended so far as Catholics were concerned to place ecclesiastics beyond the jurisdiction of lay tribunals If such were the case at pres ent how much greater would be the power of the church when the government was controlled entirely by Roman Catholics Therefore many Protestants asked earnestly that they be not abandoned by EnglandOPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 455 But whatever were the needs of Ireland however successful Home Rule might be and however little the minority might have to fear from its operation there remained nevertheless reasons why it might be inconsistent with the interests of the people of Great Britain and greatly dangerous and detrimental to them Irishmen it was said were not loyal to the British Empire and desired Home Rule now but complete separation afterward whenever that could be achieved In 1911 a leaflet addressed to the Irish people declared Your duty is to teach your chil dren to be loyal to Mother Eire prevent them from participat ing in any celebration connected with the forthcoming Coro nation About the same time in Limerick a mob tore down the Union Jack from a house where it was displayed and after wards burned it When it was feared that the British army might be used against Ulster the story of the conduct of Irish mem bers in 1902 in the house of commons was given wide circulation what Sir Henry Lucy called their merry quarter of an hour and their ghoullike ecstasy as they shouted and laughed while news was read of the defeat of Methuen with the names of those who lay dead on the veldt There was many a colored cartoon of Mr Redmond dancing with glee at the news and many another of a British soldier sternly reminding him how the Nationalist members had rejoiced with the question Shall British troops be used against loyal Ulstermen Some declared that the English army had been referred to as the most immoral and most degraded Force in Europe In 1913 the Tipperary Star published a very slanderous and derisive account of English soldiers This however was condemned and by some thought not to represent Irish feeling generally and the Liberal publi cation department issued a leaflet to the effect that The men who cheered the defeat can be made proud of their connection with Great Britain and the Empire by a gift    of Home Rule But apprehension and disquietude would not down It was thought that disloyalty appeared particularly in the attitude of some Irishmen towards the Germans Should they land in Ireland they will be received with willing hearts and strong hands said the Kilkenny People in 1909 Four456 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW years later the following notice is said to have been sent broad cast through Ireland The mighty British Empire is on the verge of destruction   The English live in daily terror of Germany War between England and Germany is at hand Englands cowardly and degenerate population wont make soldiers    What will England do Shell get Irish Fools to join her Army and Navy send them to fight and die for her Empire    Stand aside and have your revenge Without Irelands help England will go down before Germany    The English know this and they have offered us a bribe and call it Home Rule It is not without interest wrote Bernhardi about the same time to know that if ever it comes to war with England Germany will have allies in the enemys camp There was belief that his feeling arose not merely from hatred and dislike which would disappear when Ireland received the Home Rule which she desired since it was not Home Rule alone which she sought but complete separation and entire inde pendence In 1911 the monument unveiled to Parnell in Dublin contained in its inscription We have never attempted to fix the Ne plus ultra to the progress of Irelands nationhood and we never shall I promise to work for the Independence of Ireland ran the constitution of the Irish National Boy Scouts Let us said a speaker at Kilkenny in 1912 pray for the time when the exigencies of the Pirate Empire will give us a fighting chance to break the last link of the chains that bind us It was said that even Mr Redmond in some of his American speeches looked forward to the goal of national Independence Ireland did not desire to remain part of the British Empire like Canada and other selfgoverning dominions but wished for individuality like Germany or France In 1912 an Irish news paper declared that it had nothing but loathing and contempt for the men who prated about this Home Rule Bill uniting us in bonds of love and loyalty to the British Empire Some believed what John Bright had said long before that if the Irish had their way they would make of the country one of the states of the American UnionOPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 457 These forebodings might be of things not to come but Eng land must take every precaution to avoid their fulfilment Stretching from Shetland to Dover the British Isles occupied the strongest strategical position in Europe They mounted guard over the northern countries and the navy watching the outlets from the North Sea made it impossible for their most dangerous naval competitors to attack the trade routes along which came the necessary supplies of food while the open coast to the west gave free access to all of the highways of theworld But if Ireland were in possession of a foreign power or in time of war acted with it Great Britain would hold the weakest position in Europe because she would lie between enemies in Ireland and others on the continent Then enemy cruisers and submarines issuing from any of the numerous bays between Queenstown and Lough Swilly could cut across the ocean lanes and stop supplies of food and raw materials vitally necessary Admiral Mahan had expressed his opinion It is impossible for a military man or a statesman with appreciation of military conditions to look at the map and not perceive that the ambition of Irish Separatists if realized would be even more threatening to the national life of Great Britain than the secession of the South was to that of the American Union    Ireland by geographical position lies across and controls the communications of Great Britain with the outside world save only    the North Sea and the Baltic    And what had the north not been willing to do for the preser vation of the Union A leaflet published by the National Union of Conservative and Constitutional Associations declared that Home Rule meant really the erection of a hostile state within 60 miles of England a perpetual source of alarm in case of continental complications an enemy in the rear of Great Britain always ready to assist her foes and that it involved a weakening of her defensive force the necessity of maintaining a powerful fleet in St Georges Channel and a large increase in the British army In 1912 Admiral Lord Charles Beresford explained that in the great sea458 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW wars of the past Ireland had always been regarded as a possible base for flank attack upon England In the wars with France in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries this had always been true It was so at the present time And even if Ireland were not hostile but merely afforded shelter and supplies to hostile warships immense damage could be done in a short time and it would be necessary for the admiralty to detach a squadron for the purpose of watching the whole of Ireland At the same time Earl Percy pointed out that no scheme of Home Rule could be judged without considering it in connec tion with the changes which had resulted from the fundamental alteration of the balance of power in Europe seen now in these latter days The future he thought was very dark the nations had set out on the march to Armageddon war could not be long delayed and there was little time for England to put her house in order The strategical value of Ireland would be pro foundly affected by separation from England and this would constitute a grave source of weakness even if a comparatively loyal government were installed  In any attack by an enemy on our commerce Ireland will become of supreme importance    In the second if not in the first stage of European war    the closest cooperation between the governments of Ireland and England will be essential In a military sense the two countries were one area of opera tions and supply and at such a time the dissolution of the union binding together the very heart of the empire would be a strate gic mistake involving disaster which could not be exaggerated It was often said that in recent years it had been the practice of the British Empire to grant selfgovernment to great colonies such as Canada Australia and South Africa always with good results and the same should be done for Ireland where the like happy outcome would follow But it was answered that here the colonial analogy was fallacious since there was a funda mental difference between the position of Ireland and that of any of the twentyeight communities which now had home rule Those colonies were thousands of miles away Ireland was near at hand As yet distance made it impossible for the colOPPOSITION TO HOME RULE 459 onies to be represented in the imperial parliament and they had no representatives there but Ireland had more than her population warranted The colonies had a vast future and hereafter were destined to rival the United Kingdom Ireland had no future apart from Great Britain Irish finance was inseparably bound up with that of England but such was not true of the colo nies There no important minorities desired to continue under the British parliament in Ireland there was Ulster The colo nies were practically independent their loyalty was unques tioned and they could not if they would directly threaten the safety of the British Isles but a hostile Ireland could stop the food of Great Britain and could give to an enemy a base of operations against the most vital parts of the commonwealth These arguments were advanced by one party to the great dispute The writer has given them as he found them It must be that many spoke in narrowness and passion or stirred by blind prejudice or aroused in behalf of their interest but no one unprejudiced can fail to see that others pleaded honestly with highest motive and best good faith Beyond doubt many of the propositions were true and not to be neglected by those who had the interests of their country at heart But one makes this admission sadly If only things could have been different If circumstances could have been what they are not If mis takes in the past had been avoided How well if the wisdom of one people and the good fortune of the other had obviated these difficulties or solved them long ago The interests of the two peoples in world affairs are inseparable and the two should be inseparable in the crisis now before them Those who declared that Irishmen really wished independence and complete separation from England have been justified be yond expectation by the Sinn Fein movement and the Easter rising at Dublin while they who contended for the rights of Ulster merely spoke for what the northern inhabitants seemed sternly resolved to uphold But there must be now a great number of moderate and liberal people both in England and in all parts of Ireland willing to compromise anxious to con460 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW struck and filled with fine faith in the future It would be most rash to make predictions in the midst of this fateful and difficult present but may it not indeed be that hereafter these men and women can bring to fulfilment the just aspirations of Ireland in such manner that old dislike and suspicion may be changed to sincere good faith and good will

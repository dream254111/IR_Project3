KIBITKAS OF TIAN SHAN BY ELLSWORTH HUNTINGTON Since the completion of the Central Asiatic Railroad the interior of Russian Turkestan has become as accessible as the remoter portions of our own Southwest Russian rule is firmly established and the only difficulties are the inevitable ones which beset the traveller who journeys among the mountains or with Oriental ser vants One day for example our capable head man a Sart from Andijan was told to buy some meat to be used tomorrow Oh said he that is unnecessary God will provide meat when we need it  Yes but he wants us to make what provision we can for the future No not at all answered the Oriental this morning when we had no meat did not the Russian officer who is camped close by send us some And when he had no bread did we not give him a supply God will provide The difficulties afforded by the mountains are more formidable than those afforded by the people Snow and ice frequently com pel a change of route among the higher mountains and the passage of rivers is often difficult South of Son Kul Lake for instance the Narin River one of the chief tributaries of the Syr or Jaxartes wanders over a broad gravel floodplain in numerous channels which split and reunite again and again in a braided pattern When we crossed the river during the first week in July an early start was wasted for we had to sit down on the bank and literally let the stream flow by until its level Was lower The water of the river is largely derived from melting snow and naturally the supply is 513The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan greater in the middle of the day than at sunrise after the low tem perature of the night The low water of a given sunrise gets to the Son Kul ford at from ten to twelve oclock the following day At nine oclock the stream was low enough to allow a start Nearly an hour was required to cross all the little channels into which the muddy river is divided In the broad main channel we zigzagged up and down for more than fifteen minutes as the Kirghiz guide skilfully led the way from one gravel bar toanothernow against the cold torrent now with it and sometimes even back a little toward the bank from which we had started In spite of or perhaps because of slight difficulties travelling among the Tian Shan Mountains during the summer is delightful The journey of which some results are given in this article was made as a part of the work of the Pumpelly Expedition of the Car negie Institution of Washington Starting from Andijan at the terminus of the Central Asiatic Railroad in late June I903 Pro fessor William M Davis of Harvard University and myself made our way northwestward across the western end of the Tian Shan Mountains past Son Kul KulLake to Issik Kul where we sepa rated he to go north into Siberia I south into Chinese Turkestan The physiography of the portions of the Tian Shan Mountains which it was our privilege to see has been described in reports published by the Carnegie Institution In the Geographical Journal for December 1904 I have attempted to show the relation between the main physiographic facts and the main ontographic or animate facts In the present paper the same subject will be continued The main physiographic feature of the western Tian Shan region is that the socalled mountain system is in reality peneplain or region of low relief with residual mountains of harder rock rising above it which has been uplifted to an average height of ten or twelve thousand feet forming a great plateau The uplift was accompanied by warping which has divided the plateau into a series of basins and rolling bridges or uplands none of which are as yet extensively dissected by the revived and encroaching rivers Thus a large part of the western Tian Shan region consists of smoothly floored basins and gentlyrolling uplands lying at a height of from ten to twelve thousand feet and therefore subjected to a relatively heavy precipitation The conditions of climate allow an abundant growth of grass but no trees in the parts of the plateau which are free from snow during a few months in summer Thus the first and most important result of the uplifted peneplain upon life is the vast plains of rich grass which the Kirghiz call the Sirt The grassy 514The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan plains in turn influence animal life including man The climate is so cold and snow lasts so long that wild animals cannot inhabit the Sirt in great numbers unless they hibernate like the marmot or migrate like birds and even the latter cannot find food easily be cause of the scarcity of insects and of weeds with large seeds Therefore animals are rare although the conditions are almost ideal for herbivorous species during the summer months Man has taken advantage of the favourable conditions and brings his flocks of domestic animals to the Sirt every summer returning with them to the warmer lowlands in winter Nomadism is the only condition under which the human occupation of most of the Tian Shan plateau is possible It is the main fact in the lives of the people and determines not only their style of food clothing habitations household economy and commerce but also their art and their character as to industry bravery and hospitality and even as to still higher moral qualities The Kirghiz are so primitive their manner of life is so simple and so closely bound up with their physical surroundings and they are so little influenced by outside forces that they furnish an unusually good example for the study of the influence of environment on human life The Migrations of the KirghizIt is easy to see that the migra tions of the Kirghiz are the direct result of their physiographic environment and that their habitations and furniture must be such that all the household property can easily be carried from place to place The effect of environment upon the character and manners of the people is harder to estimate but must be equally real The necessity that all should engage in the same sort of work in the presence of the others whether rich or poor develops the spirit of democracy and equality which is noticeable among the Kirghiz The frequent movement from place to place and the contact with many people develop a spirit of sociability and hospitality A de scription of some of the events of two days in early July when we travelled from the Narin River up to Lake Son Kul will illustrate these points and give an idea of the daily life of the people From the ford of the Narin River an easy ride up a pretty moun tain valley brought us to a group of kibitkas or round felt tents set in a green amphitheatre surrounded by steep walls of gray lime stone An unusually neat kabitka so new as to be still white stood apart from the rest and had evidently been prepared for the foreigners at the suggestion of the Kirghiz who had of his own accord ridden ahead that morning to see that all was ready for our reception The kibitka had been picked up bodily and carried to 515The Mountains ani Kibitkas of Tian Shan a cleaner spot away from the unpleasant neighbourhood of the other kibitkas and of the flocks and herds When a dwelling is to be moved a short distance a dozen men and women go inside pick up the kibitka by the latticework fence which forms the framework of the lower wall and under the direction of a man on the outside who acts as eyes for the rest carry it blindly to the designated spot It looks like an enormous beetle walking across the turf with a dozen pair of human legs The household goods which the kibitka had shelteredthe piles of rugs felts quilts skins boxes bags wooden bowls and leather bucketsare left exposed in a sorry heap which the women goodnaturedly remove to another tent In the evening our Kirghiz village was in perfect order In the centre of the valley ten or fifteen kibitkas were scattered on a fair green slope On one side hundreds of stupid sheep were try ing to push their way into the centre of the flock on the other herds of neighing horses and stolid cattle were interspersed with camelsawkward twohumped beasts strangely out of place among the lofty mountains and ridiculous in felt coats put on to keep them warm In the morning the village was in dire confusion Kibitkas were lying in pieces on the ground with household goods strewn around them A migration was to take place and men women and children were busily making preparations The slow moving flocks of sheep had already been sent away at dawn but the rest of the animals disported themselves among the ruins of the tents waiting to be packed or ridden The men of the community were clad in big topboots black conical hats of heavy felt with brims of Astrakhan and long quilted cotton gowns which had been wet so often as to appear dark and oily Their chief business seemed to be to load the animals or to catch those which were still loose When a horse was to be caught a man seized a pole like a fishingrod with a loop of rope at the end and jumped bareback on a horse which was already bridled Violent kicking and lusty shouting started both horses into a fine gallop and it was sometimes half an hour before the loop was thrown over an animals head The women wore heavy boots and quilted gowns much like those of the men Many however had taken off the outer garment and were dressed in loose gowns of white cotton or in the case of the rich of gorgeous silk red purple and yellow The sleeves of the garments of both sexes extend five or six inches below the hands and take the place of gloves as a protection against cold especially in riding horseback The headdresses of the women often a foot 516The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan high are wonderfully constructed of fold after fold of white cloth wound into a cylinder One fold hangs over the ears and under the chin in such a way that it can be drawn up across the lower part of the face although this is rarely done From below the huge headdress the black hair hangs in braids to the ends of which is attached a cord or piece of leather studded with silver At the end of the cord close to the womans heels dangle one or two silver rubles and the keys to all the family chests When a kibitka had been tied ready for packing a tiny girl of six led up a camel ten feet high and in spite of the creatures hor rible grunts and roars made it kneel meekly as she twitched the rope fastened to a stick in its nose The saddle of the largest finest camel was decked with a long red fringe which reached for ward along the animals curved neck to its head When a load of pots pans boxes felts and parts of a kibitka had been tied securely I saw a silkgowned mother lay her baby in a wooden cradle without rockers After covering it well she tied one rope over its legs and around the cradle and a second over its chest Then in spite of its lusty crying she lifted the cradle unconcern edly to the top of the camels load lashed it on and covered both baby and load with a large rug Camels are not the only baggage animals although horses are esteemed too highly to be often bur dened with loads It was no unusual sight to see a man on one side of a stout ox and a woman on the other each with the right foot braced against the animals side while they drew taut the ropes which bound the load of kibitka poles A monkeyfaced dog slunk behind one such pair while close by a girl of ten in figured red and purple silk waited to be helped on her horse Beside her a tiny imp of three stood motionless his round astonished face long gray dress and funny high boots sinking into insignificance under the immense dome of black sheepskin which served as a hat At last when all was ready we started on a delightful ride up a steep gorge where the road zigzagged among fine spruce trees the first that we had seen A Kirghiz migration is a sight which never grows monotonous First we passed a man on a cow then a heavilyloaded camel with two small boys perched high on top of the load and two ridiculous baby camels too small to carry even a roll of felts running awkwardly in the rear Next two fat cows with wooden rings in their noses walked placidly along with loads of strawmatting and poles In front of them an old graybeard with a black hat and a wadded gray gown rode proudly on a spirited horse His gloved right hand rested in a wooden crotch supported 517The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan by a little stirrup and on his wrist was perched an eagle with a leather hood over its eyes Behind the man stood a fouryearold urchin a miniature of his grandfather his feet planted sturdily on the horse and his hands firmly grasping the old mans shoulders Ahead of this pair a ragged lad mounted bareback on a year ling steer jogged along contentedly behind a herd of horses and colts In spite of his rags he looked happy well fed and warm So too did all the people on that days march and indeed all the pastoral nomads whom I have ever met seemed to be comfort able When their flocks diminish and they grow poor they are obliged to betake themselves to agriculture leaving only the rich to continue the nomadic life When we crossed the pass at the head of the valley and entered the basin of Lake Son Kul 10ooo feet above the sea the scenery sud denly changed From the contracted limits of a young steepsided gorge we suddenly emerged into the mature topography of a gently sloping green country full of marshy places and of brooks which ran half hidden among the grass We had passed from a young valley of the present cycle of erosion into a basin where the ancient topography is largely preserved Although the season was early July bits of fresh snow lay a few hundred feet above the lake and the soft turf was thickly set with the flowers of early spring Rain fell almost daily while we were in the neighbourhood and there were frosts at night The basin of Son Kul is the favourite pastureground for the Kirghiz of a large district When the snow disappears in the middle of June they bring their cattle and sheep to feed on the rich grass and remain in the neighbourhood till snow comes again in September Every two or three weeks each camp is moved a few miles to a fresh spot both for the sake of new grass and for clean liness The summer months are the social season of the Kirghiz The comparatively welltodo people who come to Son Kul migrate to the lake from every direction As each group of relatives pitches its camp where it pleases and as the location of the camps is often changed people from all parts of the country become acquainted with each other The men ihvariably have plenty of time to talk and drink tea the women work more steadily but nevertheless have time for visiting and one occasionally sees parties of them making calls on horseback The Effect of Glaciers and Glaciation on Physiographic Forms Under the present climatic conditions of Turkestan glaciers are of small importance in their effect on life of any kind So far as 518The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan man is concerned their chief importance is that their presence or absence determines the location of roads and certain regions which might furnish good summer pasturage are left untenanted because of the difficulty of driving flocks across the surrounding glaciers The more extended glaciers of the past however and the climatic changes of which the glaciers were the accompaniment have pro duced physiographic features which are of great importance in the life of the Kirghiz of today These features divide themselves into three types First ancient moraines at the heads of the higher valleys second terraces along the middle portions of valleys at the heads of which glaciation may or may not have taken place and third extinct lakes at the lower ends of streams which terminate in closed basins The formation of lakes and of moraines needs no explanation the terraces are not so generally understood The valleys of Turkestan and of other portions of Central Asia are almost invariably terraced The terraces are of three kinds differing in composition but apparently due to the same climatic cause The first type of terrace is cut partly in rock and partly in a cover of streamlaid gravel and is found among steep young mountains where the streams are actively deepening their channels without wandering much from side to side The second type is cut wholly in streamlaid gravel and is found in valleys which are still young but have reached the stage where the streams begin to broaden their channels as well as to cut downward The third type is cut in streamlaid gravel lying unconformably upon fine silt and is found among mature mountains especially in very arid regions It has generally been assumed that such terraces as those of Turkestan are due to warping of the earths crust but this explanation is unsatisfactory The terraces occur with such uni formity of type and number in widelyseparated regions and in valleys which interlock so intricately that if they are due to warp ing of the crust the warping must have been of identically the same rhythmic type over an area extending at least twelve hundred miles east and west and eight hundred north and south Yet the warping must have been so adjusted to the minor features of the earths surface that it caused similar acceleration or retardation of the streams in all the valleys no matter in which direction or to what destination the water flowed Such a warping of the earths crust is contrary to what we know of the nature of earth move ments in other places and is practically impossible Accordingly we are forced to conclude that the terraces are due to the climatic 519The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan   X changes which took place in Cen tral Asia during the Glacial Period   X of as is proved by ancient moraines   ian 0c and extinct lakes CC0  5 I The formation of climatic ter w  co I races seems to be due to the fact p  0  that during glacial epochs the rate M l   IB l of weathering of the rocks was H I8 more rapid than during inter Z ia l l glacial epochs In this way the a  1 i  streams coming from young moun I i1 tains with slopes so steep that 11 I they could not possibly become  y m i I S  graded were heavily loaded and     I 1 1 I  compelled to deposit the coarser V   i I part of their loads The deepen  I m s l  1 ing of the

during the previous 0o epoch are washed away because of   the drying up of the vegetation which held them in place The 520The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan streams are thus heavily loaded and are obliged to deposit part of their load upon the fine floodplain deposits of the preceding epoch Soon however the loose materials upon the mountain sides are washed away entirely and the load of the streams is limited to the relatively small amount of detritus derived from weathering under arid conditions Under such conditions the load is not equal to the capacity of the streams and the latter begin to erode and deepen their channels Thus terraces are formed the upper part consisting of gravel the lower part of the finer deposits of the previous floodplain A repetition of the terracing process during successive pairs of glacial and interglacial epochs causes a series of terraces in each valley The diagram Fig i illustrates how this takes place in the case of a valley where the terraces are composed wholly of gravel At the begin ning of the first terracemaking epoch the stream may be in any part of the valley and the terraces on the two sides may be of very unequal width In some parts of Turkestan the terraces form broad plains elsewhere they are reduced to narrow strips Their number is usually from three to five although sometimes they all disappear while at other times the number reaches six or even seven Occasionally they are connected with moraines at their upper ends or with lake terraces at the lower ends showing that they were in process of formation at the same time as the better known features which characterize the Glacial Period The Efect of the Glacial Period on Human LifeThe effect of the Glacial Period on human life may be divided into two parts namely the results due to physiographic features produced by the climatic changes of the Glacial Period and still directly opera tive and the direct results of the climatic changes upon ancient man now operative only indirectly through heredity Of the lat ter almost nothing is known although a few phenomena to be mentioned later suggest that even during historical times the climate of the Tian Shan Mountains may have been different from now although far from being what is usually understood by the term glacial The physiographic features due to the climatic changes of the Glacial Period have already been classified as mo raines terraces and extinct lakes Their influence upon life is secondary to that of the plateau character and climate of Tian Shan but nevertheless it is one of the factors which have helped to determine the present condition of life both animal and vege table On the whole the Glacial Period has produced results which are 521tThe Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan beneficial to the human inhabitants of Tian Shan today however disagreeable they may have been to the people if any who were obliged to endure its rigours In the first place the roads are bet ter because of the Glacial Period Near the heads of the streams flatfloored glacial valleys form broad easy approaches to the high passes quite different from the narrow inaccessible gorges which would otherwise exist and which do exist in many cases just below the limit of glaciation The moraines too with the exception of the younger ones furnish easy locations for roads in spite of the fact that their topography is irregular Farther down stream the terraces supply ideal locations for roads and one can often travel for miles without any of the hindrances which are met in ordinary mountain valleys and which are abundant in Tian Shan as soon as one reaches a place where the valley is so narrow or the stream has swung so far to one side that the terraces are wholly con sumed In such cases the roads must wind up and down over rugged and precipitous rocks One realizes at once that if the roads were everywhere as difficult as in these places where the effects of the Glacial Period have been obliterated the migrations of the Kirghiz would be much more arduous and therefore it is safe to say less frequent In the next place because of glaciation the valleys are more productive The bottoms of the glaciated troughs in the higher mounains are smooth and broad and rich grass grows where nothing but stones would be found in an unglaciated country The smoothlygraded hills and hollows of the old moraines also furnish the best of summer pasture for the flocks of the nomad Kirghiz So true is this that one acquires the habit of looking for a group of tents as soon as he encounters a wellweathered moraine Lastly the gentlysloping plains of the terraces provide ideal sites for winter villages especially where neighbouring mountains furnish abundant water for irrigation and are easily accessible for the summer migrations Fine examples of all these features are found in the Alai region which lies south of the Tian Shan plateau but is of the same type physiographically and ontographically One of the most attractive yailas or summer camps of the Kirghiz that I have seen was in the hanging valley of Bursundu at the west end of the Alai Valley From the broad glaciated valley of Kok Su with its moraines and cultivated terraces a rough nar row gorge led up to a small moraine above which was the smooth est and greenest of flatfloored valleys Horses sheep camels and cattle grazed peacefully among the darkgray kibitkas which dotted 522The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan the rich sod A brook of the clearest coldest water formed a thin black line as it twisted and wriggled this way and that among the overhanging turf as though loath to leave the pleasant verdure and enter the naked gorge Not far from Bursundu the moraines of the Alai Valley are equally beautiful during the warm season As one rides among them in the fresh mountain air there is a sense of space and freedom and the varied topography furnishes a con tinual incentive to move on From one grassy hilltop a new pond appears from another a herdsman mounted on a yak and following a flock of sheep or a kibitka with a group of women sitting outside it and making the coloured felts which are so prominent an article of Kirghiz housekeeping Farther down the valleys the terraces are scarcely less attractive At the village of Jekendy a broad terrace plain is covered with heavy crops of the hardier grains and of grass Scattered here and there are houses of mud the flat roofs of which are hidden under huge stacks of hay stored against the winter when the glacial valleys and moraines must be aban doned and the flocks must be brought to winter quarters Over looking and encircling the haunts of the Kirghiz the mountains rise grandly into peaks whose beauty is enhanced by the glacial carving to which they have been subjected Their subtler influ ence joins that of the glacial troughs the moraines and the ter races in making the life and character of the Kirghiz distinctly different from what it would be if there had been no Glacial Period in recent geological times The Salt Lake of Shor KulThe terraces which surround the salt lake of Shor Kul eighty miles northeast of Kashgar prove that during the Glacial Period the lake was more extensive than at present Today it is a small body of water about ten or twelve miles east and west by two or three miles north and south Shor Kul means salt lake and the name is eminently deserved I saw it in August 1903 during a time of unusual rains The water was so full of salt that it resembled a New England pond which had been frozen clear to the bottom and was now flooded by a March thaw On the borders black illsmelling muck dipped under the water so gradually that it was impossible to say just where the lake began Out over the lake the dull gray of the lifeless brine was broken only by two or three little green islands a mile or two away and by a salt gathered far from the shore With his great hoe the man scooped up a mass of salt crystals mixed with mud Then with a skilful twist he rinsed the salt clean and poured it into one of the bags on the back of the patient wet donkey which was to carry it to market at Kashgar 5234 The Mountains and Kibilkas of Tian Shan Between the shore of the modern lake and the abandoned ancient shoreline lies a plain mostly swamp which may justly be regarded as a product of the Glacial Period It is composed of yellowish clay silt caked with salt and is merely the dry bed of the lake of glacial times On one side the lake presents a lifeless expanse of brine on the other the country is composed of broad stretches of subangular gravel devoid of vegetation except a few bushes and a low sweet herb Between these two desert regions however the ancient lakebed itself is full of vegetation On the drier edges the vegetation consists chiefly of low bushes with a profusion of insipid berries resembling the huckleberry in appear ance In other places where the plain is smoother and better watered vegetation is luxuriant and the country is what is called a swamp Often the surface is dry for months but it is inundated at certain seasons and there is always water below The most abundant plant is the feathery tamarisk with its spikes of beauti ful pink flowers turning to delicate shades of red and brown as they grow older Between the tamarisk bushes tall reedy grasses with edges which cut like knives sprout abundantly and are inter spersed with weeds bearing yellow and purple flowers Occasional springs form the centres of turfy marshes where the fresh water of the springs washes away the salt and permits the growth of ordi nary grass In many places the swamp is diversified by low hills or flat tables several miles broad rising twenty or thirty feet above the swamp Their greater elevation causes them to be covered with a less dense growth of tamarisks and grass which are in part replaced by berry bushes and knotty poplars resembling the cottonwood The trees stand from twenty to a hundred feet apart with many bushes and dead trees between them The scenery has an open pasture effect which is very pleasing Even in the swamp the views of waving tamarisks and bright flowers are pretty even if limited and unvaried The springs of the Shor Kul swamp have the remarkable habit of frequently appearing upon hills At the village of Jai Tepeh for instance the hospitable Minbashi or headman took me at once to view the wonder of the village the five springs of sweet water which well up on the sides of a little hill about twentyfive feet high For miles around there is a smooth plain with very few springs but here on the hill the water bubbles up with consider able force and the same thing occurs in several other places The hills are composed of gravel or sand the plain of fine clayey silt During an interglacial epoch or before the Glacial Period the coun 524The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan try appears to have been so dry that sand and fine gravel were deposited subaerially forming a plain at the level of the present hilltops Under changed conditions the plain was thoroughly dis sected leaving only hills and low plateaux Next the lake rose during a glacial epoch and the sand and gravel were covered with clayey silt which is impervious to water The hilltops however were not covered with silt or were so thinly covered that the underlying coarser material was soon exposed once more after the retirement of the water Now rainwater and the drainage of the mountains enter the gravel at A Figure 2 and flow easily through A FIG 2CROSS SECTION TO ILLUSTRATE THE SPRINGS OF THE SHOR KUL SWAMP the relatively coarse material of the subaerial deposits but cannot get out through the impervious clay B above or through the rock beneath C Finally the water reaches a little hill such as D where the clay is either absent or dissected and being under pressure bubbles up in a natural artesian well From the foregoing description it appears that the swamp of Shor Kul with its peculiar vegetation and its unusual springs is due to the changes of climate which took place during the Glacial Period An indirect effect of the changes can be seen in the in fluence which the swamp has had upon the human inhabitants of the region The people of Shor Kul are Kirghiz who settled there a few generations ago coming from the north from the plateau of Tian Shan They are of precisely the same stock as their mountain neighbours and so far as I know have been exposed to the same conditions with the exception of those which pertain to the character of the country which they inhabit Accord ingly unless the people of Shor Kul were originally different from those of Tian Shan it is a fair inference that any differences which now exist are due ueto present environment The people of Shor Kul are under Chinese rule and those of Tian Shan under Rus sian but it is not probable that this has as yet produced any marked 525The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan effect Moreover part of the Tian Shan Kirghiz are under Chinese rule but they do not seem to differ greatly from their neighbours although on the whole they appear poorer and possibly somewhat more suspicious and less hospitable The Kirghiz of Shor Kul still consider nomadism the ideal life and some of the richer members of the community go to the moun tains The majority now spend all the year at Shor Kul some of them living always in one place others moving about within a very circumscribed area The round kibitka is still used but houses of mud are more common and are inhabited even in summer which is rarely the case among the true nomads of the mountains even though they have houses for winter use One reason for the greater use of houses at Shor Kul may be the mosquitoes which are innumerable especially near the springs where of necessity the villages must be located There is less life and movement among the people and less travelling from place to place partly perhaps because the roads in the swamp are exceedingly muddy whenever it rains and locomotion for such animals as sheep is almost out of the question With the tendency to a more sedentary life and per haps because of it there come a greater curiosity a greater ten dency to stand and stare at every act or gesture of strangers The Kirghiz of the mountains are interested in seeing strangers but they are polite in their way of manifesting their interest Hospi tality is still a virtue of the people of Shor Kul but it is less spon taneous than among their cousins of the mountains and more restricted to men of influence It is a necessity among people who travel much but becomes a luxury among those who usually stay at home Since the Kirghiz came to Shor Kul it is hard to say whether industry has gained or lost Everywhere the Kirghiz are lazy according to Occidental standards although they work with re markable energy at times At Shor Kul agriculture is more im portant than elsewhere and requires more steady application to work than does the care of flocks The number of animals owned by the sedentary people is naturally less than among the nomads and the kinds are different Donkeys which the nomads despise are freely used at Shor Kul but camels are rare because the mud is often so bad that they are helpless Sheep too are less abun dant and naturally the amount of meat and milk consumed is far less than among the mountains Yet in spite of changes old cus toms persist with great tenacity The nomad in the treelessmoun tains is obliged to resort to dried dung for fuel The people of 526The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan Shor Kul preserve the same habit in spite of the fact that there are hundreds of trees many of them dead and fallen within a few miles of the villages and although dried dung is a very inconvenient form of fuel and produces a most disagreeable smoke Perhaps the most marked result of the partial change from a nomadic to a sedentary life is the lessened freedom of the women Among the nomads one sees them continually engaged in their household tasks They converse freely with the men and make no attempt to keep themselves hidden At Shor Kul on the other hand wherever permanent houses have become the rule they re main for the most part within doors and when obliged to be out of doors take evident pains to avoid the gaze of the men They are beginning to fall into the deplorable condition of women in other Mohammedan countries It is hard to say to just what ex tent the differences between the Kirghiz of Shor Kul and of Tien Shan are due to differences of environment but it is at least worth noticing that where the Glacial Period caused the formation of the extinct lake of Shor Kul and thus produced unusual physiographic conditions the people who have for a few generations been sub jected to the new conditions begin to show changes in their method of life and even in character The Lake of Issik KulThe most important lake of Turkestan is Issik Kul a sheet of water one hundred and ten miles long from east to west and from eight to thirty miles wide It lies at a height of 5 I80 feet above the sea in a region of rainfall so mode rate as not to allow of agriculture without irrigation On either side rise snowcovered mountains to a height of I4000 feet or more The traveller who expects to find a genuine mountain lake how ever will be disappointed at least if he approaches from the west end as we did Issik Kul like most of the lakes of Asia is smaller than formerly and lacks the beauty of a body of water which fills its basin to the brim Leaving the halfburied spurs of the blockfault mountains on the southwestern border of the Issik Kul basin one emerges upon a broad stretch of piedmont gravel much of it rough angular and shining black with  desert varnish Lakeward the gravel passes into silt covered with bushy vegetation and finally two or three miles from the base of the mountains the lake is bordered by a tract of marsh The silt between the gravel and the marsh is util ized by the Kirghiz for their primitive agriculture The system of irrigation is extremely crude and the fields of peas wheat and barley are often so weedy that one is puzzled to know where the 527The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan cultivated land begins In summer part of the Issik Kul Kirghiz migrate to the mountains and part to the marshy lands along the lake shore In each village two or three of the poorest men are left to tend the irrigation canals The villages themselves are merely scattered collections of cattle yards surrounded by walls of mud and brush inside which the kibitkas are pitched in winter The people of Issik Kul are less purely nomadic than some of the Kirghiz but they do not show the tendency to change which we have found at Shor Kul The western portion of Issik Kul is uninteresting and the flat shore forms smooth unbroken curves Toward the middle of the lake however the bands of marsh and of silt described above dis appear the smooth slopes of naked gravel are covered with green fields and trenched by small valleys and the bold shore becomes sinuous with high promontories and pretty bays Farther east the shoreline becomes still more irregular and is characterized by long fingershaped fiords which indicate that the region has been depressed so that the valleys are drowned Instead of the dull scenery of the western end of the lake or the pretty but not un usual views of the central portions the eastern end possesses a unique and unexpected beauty A mile or two from the water one enjoys a pleasant prospect of smooth green plain fertile well tilled and dotted with the villages of latelyarrived Russians or with lines of ancient mounds running nearly north and south Suddenly however the plain is broken by a deep fiord a lane of water between steep green walls from fifty to two hundred feet high The limited but wonderfully beautiful scenery of the fiords is in utter contrast to the broad views of green plain white moun tains and blue lake which lie just above The little bays the bushy shores the long winding pathways of clear water and the water fowl which fly up from lake or marsh entice one onward against his will to see what new beauty lies concealed The cause of the marked difference between the two ends of Issuk Kul is that in re cent geological times the whole region has been tilted up on the west and down on the east so that at the western end the uninter esting lake bottom is left exposed while at the eastern end the valleys have been drowned and beautified Today the monotonous western end is left to the Kirghiz but the attractive eastern end is the seat of several Russian colonies chief among which is the prosperous little town of Przhevalsk Agriculture seems to thrive although the climate is so cool that at the end of July I found strawberries just ripening 528The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan Issik Kul has been subject to changes of level Two changes took place before the lake was tilted and are recorded in two high terraces beside the outlet It is possible that the terraces record a double rise and fall of the lake during two epochs of the Glacial Period but no certain conclusion can be reached because of the peculiar character of the lakes outlet After the tilting the first posi tion of the lake of which we have certain knowledge was about thirty feet higher than today where the water stood long enough to form a welldefined beach and bluff Along the flat shore of the western end the thirtyfoot beach is an insignificant line of sand below which are smaller ridges of sand marking stages of retreat Be hind the ridges are lagoonlike strips of marsh The present beach is a sand ridge of the same sort often with a reedy lagoon behind it Where the lake shore begins to be drowned the old beach is much more prominent It appears like a railroad grade forming a flattopped ridge across the mouths of valleys or a cut along the ends of spurs Mankind probably occupied the eastern shores of Issik Kul pre vious to the rise of the lake to the thirtyfoot level Fourteen miles east of the Russian village of Sazanovka an artificial mound stands directly on the edge of the bluff which marks the old shoreline The mound is of unknown age and like the other prehistoric mounds of the region consists of granite cobblestones from five to twelve inches in diameter piled in a circular wall and covered with loam It is of small size about a dozen feet high and thirty feet in diame ter About a third of the mound on the lake side has been cut away and the boulders lie scattered at the foot of the bluff It is probable that the mound was built during or before the time when the lake stood at a high level and was located so close to the shore that in course of time the waves undermined it There is a possi bility that it was built on the very edge of the bluff after the water had retired and that it has since been worn away by ordinary ero sion This is unlikely however because of the smoothness with which the line of the bluff extends across the middle of the mound and because of the lack of debris at the base of the latter The lake could carry away the debris and preserve the smoothness of its shoreline which would be impossible for ordinary erosion A single case like this leads to no definite conclusion but it suggests an interesting field of investigation in the relation of Issik Kul to early man Son Kul affords another suggestion of the way in which phy siographic conditions may have varied since the advent of man On 529The Mountains and Kibitkas of Tian Shan the mountain sides at a height of from ooo000 to I0500 feet above the sea we found the remains of a number of large irrigation canals They must be hundreds possibly thousands of years old since they are thoroughly graded and are sometimes wholly obliterated for a space They cannot be of extreme age however for many can still be traced throughout their entire length although they lie across slopes of considerable steepness where erosion is so rapid that such small features must soon be eradicated They must be irrigation canals for they contour around the hillsare broad enough to carry most of the water of the streams from which they diverge and come to an end in places suitable for fields The peculiar fea ture is that they lie at a great altitude where there is now no agri culture nor could be it would seem Snow falls at Son Kul so the people say during all but two months of the year On the morn ing of July 8 at the altitude of the upper canals I walked on new snow which was said to have been a foot deep a few days before Next morning near the shore of Son Kul below the level of the fields watered by the canals the ground was stiff with frost and the little pools on the edges of the brooks were skimmed with ice Moreover if agriculture was possible under such conditions irri gation seems unnecessary In July the ground was saturated with moisture and the natives told us that the grass is always as green as when we saw it The simplest hypothesis is that at some time since the human occupation of the country the climate was warmer and therefore drier than now but this cannot be proved In regions such as Transcaspia and Persia there is strong evidence of a greater water supply during antiquity It is hard to reconcile the two sets of facts but it may be that climate is more changeable than has been supposed and that since the dawn of history man has passed through more than one change between colder and warmer or moister and drier conditions If this has been the case the course of history must have been deeply affected by geographic causes as yet uninvestigated

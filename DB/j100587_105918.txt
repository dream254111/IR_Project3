LETTER TO MATHEW MATY M D SEC R S FROM THE REV JOHN SWINTON B D F R S CUSTOS ARCHIVORUM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD MEMBER OF THE ACADEMY DEGLI APATISTI AT FLORENCE AND OF THE ETRUSCAN ACADEMY OF CORTONA IN TUSCANY GOOD SIR T H E PERSON THAT FIRST SAW THE VERY REMARKABLE LUMINOUS APPEARANCES IN THE AIR HERE ON TUESDAY OCTOBER 24 1769 AS FAR AS I HAVE HITHERTO BEEN ABLE TO LEARN WAS THE REV MR CLEAVER STUDENT OF CHRISTCHURCH WHO ON HIS RETURN HOME AT A VILLAGE CALLED HORTON SIX OR SEVEN MILES FROM OXFORD ABOUT 7H 15 P M OBSERVED WITH SOME DEGREE OF ASTONISHMENT A DARK FUSCOUS VAPOUR RESEMBLING A BLACKISH CLOUD CON TIGUOUS TO THE NORTHERN HORIZON OUT OF THIS VAPOUR THERE ISSUED ANOTHER OF A FLAME COLOUR IN THE NNW NOT UNLIKE THE METEOR SEEN BY ME SEPT 9 1769 AND DESCRIBED IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS HIS ACCOUNT OF IT IF I REMEMBER RIGHT WAS THAT  IT LOOKED LIKE AN HOUSE OR BUILD  ING SET ON FIRE THIS AT FIRST WAS CONFINED TO A VERY SMALL SPACE IN THE HEAVENS BUT SOON AFTER EX  PHILOSOPH TRANSACT VOL LIX FOR THE YEAR 1769 P 369 370 371 372 PANDED READ DEC 20 1770533 PANDED ITSELF IN SUCH A MANNER THAT IT COVERED A VERY LARGE AND EXTENSIVE TRACT IN THAT PART OF THE HE MISPHERE WHERE IT FIRST APPEARED IN THIS STATE THE METEOR CONTINUED TILL 7H 45 P M WHEN IT ASSUMED A DEEP BLOODRED COLOUR MOVING A LITTLE TOWARDS THE WEST WHICH GAVE IT A VERY AWFUL ASPECT MR CLEAVER IMPARTED TO ME NO PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO ITS EXTINCTION BUT ONLY SAID THAT HE SAW NOT THE FAINTEST TRACES OF IT AFTER EIGHT OCLOCK SO THAT IT MIGHT PROBABLY ABOUT THAT TIME OR A LITTLE BEFORE HAVE TOTALLY DISAP PEARED THE SAME NIGHT AT 8H 10 P M I SAW IN THE GREAT QUADRANGLE OF CHRISTCHURCH AND THAT PART OF FISHSTREET ADJOINING TO IT SEVERAL LUCID STREAMERS ASCENDING IN THE N AND N W FROM THE HORIZON OR RATHER A DUSKY KIND OF VAPOUR CONTIGUOUS TO IT TO A VERY CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT THESE ALL MOVED TOWARDS THE S AND S E WITH GREAT VELOCITY AND SOON AFTER MANY OTHER SIMILAR STREAMS OF LIGHT SHOT UP FROM THE HORIZON IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEMISPHERE PARTI CULARLY IN THE S AND S E THEY WERE ALL OF A VERY PALE YELLOW COLOUR SUCH AS THOSE THAT FORM THE AURORAE BOREALES OF THE COMMON KIND THEY CON STANTLY MULTIPLIED IN SO AMAZING A MANNER AND WITH SUCH SURPRIZING CELERITY THAT BY 8H 15 P M THEY SEEMED TO HAVE ALMOST INTIRELY COVERED THE GREATEST PART OF THE HEMISPHERE AND THEN CENTERED IN A POINT A LITTLE TO THE S OF THE ZENITH THEY WERE ATTENDED BY AN IN FINITE NUMBER OF FLASHES OR CORUSCATIONS AND UNDU LATIONS OF THE LUCID MATTER AS  IS USUAL IN SUCH PHAE NOMENA IN FINE THE WHOLE ATMOSPHERE OR RATHER  PHILOSOPH TRANSACT UBI SUP P 367 473  ALIB THE534 THE WHOLE COLLECTION OF THE LUMINOUS VAPOUR LODGED IN IT WAS IN A CONTINUAL AGITATION FOR ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN HOUR DURING WHICH TIME THE WHOLE HEMI SPHERE SEEMED TO BE ALL ON A BLAZE THIS MOST GLORIOUS AND EXTRAORDINARY APPEARANCE WAS HOWEVER OF A VERY SHORT AND INCONSIDERABLE DURATION THE EXTINCTION OF THE WHOLE BEING SO COM PLETELY EFFECTED BY 8H 40 P M THAT NO REMAINS OF THE PHAENOMENON IN ANY PART OF THE HEAVENS COULD THEN BE DISCERNED BUT WHAT PRINCIPALLY ENGAGED MY ATTENTION THIS EVENING WAS A LUMINOUS ARCH OR ZONE OF A VERY BEAUTIFUL PURPLE COLOUR SUCH AS I HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE WHICH PRESENTED ITSELF TO MY VIEW ABOUT 8H 40 P M AND EXTENDED FROM E TO W NEARLY AS I APPREHENDED BISECTING THE HEMISPHERE THIS BEGAN TO GROW FAINT A LITTLE BEFORE NINE OCLOCK AND IN LESS THAN TEN MINUTES TIME AS NEAR AS I COULD GUESS TO TALLY DISAPPEARED THE LIGHT CAST BY THE AURORAE BOREALES ABOVE MEN TIONED WAS GREATER THAN ANY I HAD EVER OBSERVED TO ATTEND SUCH PHAENOMENA BEFORE NOR INDEED DID I EVER MEET WITH A DESCRIPTION OF ANY METEORS RE SEMBLING THAT MENTIONED HERE IN EVERY PARTICULAR THE CONVERSION OF THE FLAMECOLOUR IN THE FIRST STAGE OF THE METEOR INTO A DEEP BLOODRED TOGETHER WITH ITS WONDER FUL EXPANSION AND THE BEAUTIFUL PURPLE ZONE OR COLOUR ED ARCH WHICH CLOSED THE WHOLE ARE SINGULARITIES THAT I BELIEVE NEVER OCCURED BEFORE OR AT LEAST SUCH AS HAVE NEVER HITHERTO MET WITH A PROPER AND ADEQUATE DESCRIPTION SOME OF THESE PHAENOMENA SEEM FROM THE PUBLIC PAPERS TO HAVE BEEN SEEN AT LONDON WINDSOR AND OTHER PLACES AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM 6535 FROM OXFORD ABOUT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY AP PEARED THERE WHICH REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE ON SEVERAL ACCOUNTS MERITS A PLACE IN THIS LETTER THE WHOLE CITY FOR A SHORT TIME SEEMED TO BE PERFECTLY ILLUMINATED THE LIGHT CAST BY THE AURORAE SUCCEEDING THE LUMINOUS APPEARANCE OF A DEEP BLOODRED COLOUR BEING AS I APPREHENDED MUCH SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE FULL MOON IN FINE THE WHOLE PHAENOMENON OR RATHER ALL THE PHAENOMENA WAS SO VERY STRIKING AND REMARKA BLE THAT IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON TOPICS OF CON VERSATION AMONGST ALL ORDERS AND DEGREES OF PEOPLE HERE FOR ABOVE A MONTH AFTER IT APPEARED I SHALL ONLY BEG LEAVE TO ADD THAT THE REVEREND AND LEARNED DR SHARP OF CHRISTCHURCH PROFESSOR OF GREEK IN THIS UNIVERSITY ASSURED ME THAT HE SAW SOME OF THE COMMON AURORAE BOREALES BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE OCLOCK THE SAME NIGHT AND THAT I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE GOOD SIR YOUR MUCH OBLIGED AND MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT

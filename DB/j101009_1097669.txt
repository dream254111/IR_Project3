replace the pavement In view of all the facts we should incline to regard this as in the nature of a penalty to secure obedience of the company to the regu lation and in any event in the light of the conduct of the parties in relation to the litigation in the State court we think the railroad com pany has not lost the right to maintain one track in the street in ques tion as it now exists without the adoption of any further ordinance on the subject On the ground wvhich we have stated we think the decree of the Cir cnit Court wrong and for that reason it mnust be reversed and the catise remanded for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion NTEWe hail this decision with positive pleasure The ruling of the lowerl court was criticised by Mr R G H Kean of the Lynchburg bar

making its protection conditional upon com pliance with regulations for the protection of persons and property from destruction and annoyance by them are within the police power 2 A State statute providing that no dog shall be entitled to the protection of the law unless placed upon the assessment rolls and that no recovery for its value can be had for more than the amount fixed by the owner in the last assess ment is a constitutional exercise of the police power In error to the Court of Appeals for the Parish of Orleans in the State of Louisiana to review a julgment of that court reversing the judgment of the Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans in favor of the plaintiff George W Sentell Jr against the New Orleans  Carrollton Railroad Company for the value of a dog negligently killed by defendant the judgment of the Court of Appeals being in favor of defendant Affirned Statement by Mr Justice BROWN This was an action originally instituted by Sentell in the civil district court for the parish of Orleans to recover the value of a Newfoundland  Headnotes from advance sheets of Lawyers Cooperative Publishing Co by per mission July 2001897 SENTELL V N 0  CARROLLTON R R CO bitch known as ICountess Lona alleged to have been negligently killed by the railroad company The company answered denying the allegation of negligence and set up as a separate defense that plaintiff had not complied either with the requirements of the State law or of the city ordinances with respect to the keeping of dogs and was therefore not entitled to recover The law of the State was as follows SEC 1 Be it enacted by the General Assembly of the State of Louisiana That sec 1201 twelve hundred and one of the Revised Statutes of Louisiana be amended and reenacted so as to read as follows From and after the passage of this Act dogs owned by citizens of this State are hereby declared to be pelronal property of such citizens and shall be placed on the same guaranties of law as other personal property provided such dogs are given in by the owner thereof to the assessor SEC 2 Be it further enacted etc That no dog shall be entitled to the protec tion of the law unless the same shall have been placed upon the assessment rolls  SEC 3 Be it further enacted etc That in civil actions for the killing of or for injuries done to dogs the owner cannot recover beyond the amount of the value of such dog or dogs as fixed by himself in the last assessment preceding the killing or injuries complained of SEC 4 Be it further enacted etc That all laws in conflict with this Act be repealed Approved July 5 1882 By the city ordinance adopted July 1 1890 No 4613 no dog shall be permitted to run or be at large upon any street alley high way common or public square within the limits of the city of New Orleans  provided that this section shall not apply to any dog to which a tag obtained from the treasurer is attaclied By sec 8 the treas urer was directed to furnish metal dog tags to all persons applying for the same at the rate of 2 each available only for the year in which they were issued Plaintiff denied the constitutionality of the State Act and the court charged the jury that the fact that the dog was not tagged as required by the city ordinances could not affect the right of the plaintiff to recover that the above Act of the legislature was unconstitutional as destructive of the right of property and that a dog being property a law which requires that property should not be protected unless listed for taxation was in conflict with the Constitution of the United States providing that no person shall be deprived of his life liberty or prop erty without lue process of law The jury returned a verdict in favor of the plaintiff for 250 upon which judgment was entered The case was carried to thle Court of Appeals which reversed the 201VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER judgment of the trial court and entered judgment in favor of the defendant holding that plaintiff should have shown a compliance with the law of the State and the ordinances of the city as a condition pre cedent to recover Whereupon the plaintiff sued out a writ of error from this court Messrs George Denegre and Omer Villere for plaintiff in error Mr Henry P Dart for defendant in error Mr Justice BROWN delivered the opinion of the court The case turns upon the constitutionality of a law of the State of Louisiana requiring dogs to be placed upon the assessment rolls and limiting any recovery by the owner to the value fixed by himself for the purpose of taxation The dog in question was a valuable Newfoundland bitch registered in the American Kennels studbook and was kept by her owner for breeding purposes It seems that while following him in a walk upon the streets she stopped on the track of the railroad company and being otherwise engaged for the moment failed to notice the approach of an electric car which was coming toward her at great speed and being moreover heavy with young and not possessed of her usual agility she was caught by the car and instantly killed The Court of Appeals was evidently of opinion that her owner knowing of her con dition should not have taken her upon a public thoroughfare without exercising the greatest care and vigilance and that the accident was largely due to a want of prudence upon his part The facts however were not properly before the court and the opinion was put upon the ground that the State law was constitutional and valid as a police regu lation to prevent the indiscriminate owning and breeding of worthless dogs The judges also annexed a certificate that the decision was reversed upon the ground that the law was constitutional and that no other point was passed upon By the common law as well as by the law of most if not all the States dogs are so far recognized as property that an action will lie for their conversion or injury 2 Bl Com 393 Cummings v Purham 1 Met 555 Kinsman v

shows that property in dogs is of an imperfect or qualified nature and that they stand as it were between auimals ferce naturce in which until killed or subdued there is no property and domestic animals in which the right of property is perfect and complete They are not con sidered as being upon the same plane with horses cattle sheep and other domesticated animals but rather in the category of cats monkeys parrots singing birds and similar animals kept for pleasure curiosity or caprice They have no intrinsic value by which we understand a value common to all dogs as such and independent of the particular breed or individual Unlike other domestic animals they are useful neither as beasts of burden for draft except to a limited extent nor for food They are peculiar in the fact that they differ among them selves more widely than any other class of animals and can hardly be said to have a characteristic common to the entire race While the higher breeds rank among the noblest representatives of the animal kingdom and are justly esteemed for their intelligence sagacity fidelity watchfulness affection and above all for their natural com panionship with man others are afflicted with such serious infirmities of temper as to be little better than a public nuisance All are more or less subject to attacks of hydrophobic madness As it is practically impossible by statute to distinguish between the different breeds or between the valuable and the worthless such legis lation as has been enacted upon the subject though nominally including the whole canine race is really directed against the latter class and is based upon the theory that the owner of a really valuable dog will feel sufficient interest in him to comply with any reasonable regulation de signed to distinguish him from the common herd Acting upon the principle that there is but a qualified property in them and that while private interests require that the valuable one shall be protected pub lic interests demand that the worthless shall be exterminated they have from time immemorial been considered as holding their lives at 1897 203VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the will of the legislature and properly falling within the police powers of the several States Laws for the protection of domestic animals are regarded as having but a limited application to dogs and cats and regardless of statute a ferocious dog is looked upon as hostis humani generis and as having no right to his life which man is bound to respect Putnam v Payne 13 Johns 312 Hinckley v Emerson 4 Cow 351 15 Am Dec 383 Brown v

question have been enacted in many of the States and their constitutionality though often attacked has been generally if not universally upheld Thus in Tower v Tower 18 Pick 262 an Act which authorized  any person to kill any dog or dogs found and being without a collar was con strued to authorize the killing of a dog out of the inclosure of his owner although he was under his immediate care and this was known to the person killing the dog In Mlorey v Brown 42 N H 373 a statute providing that no per son should be liable for killing a dog found without a collar with the name of the owner engraved thereon was held to justify the killing although the defendant had actual notice of the ownership of the dog found without such collar Plaintiff claimed that the Act was uncon stitutional but the court held that it was not an Act to take private property for public use or to deprive parties of their property in dogs but merely to regulate the use and keeping of such property in a man ner which seemed to the legislature reasonable and expedient  It is a mere police regulation such as we think the Legislature might con stitutionally establish  To the same effect are Carter v Dow 16 AWis 299 Mitchell v Wtilliams 27 Ind 62 Haller v Sheridan 27 Ind 494 The statutes of Massachusetts from the earliest colonial period to the present day are reviewed in an elaborate opinion in Blair v Fore hand 100 Mass 136 1 Am Rep 94 97 Am Dec 82 and laws were shown to have existed sometimes for the killing of  unruly and raven ous dogs sometimes as in Nantucket in 1743 for the killing of  any dog or bitch whatsoever that shall at any time be found there and sometimes for the killing of dogs strolling out of the inclosure or immediate care of the owner or going at large without a collar In the particular case it was held that a statute declaring that any 204 JulySENTELL V N O  CARROLLTON R R CO person might and every police officer and constable should kill or cause to be killed all dogs whenever or wherever found not licensed and collared according to other provisions of the statute was within the constitutional limits of the authority of the legislature Such acts appear to have been very frequent in that State and their constitution ality generally acquiesced in In the more recent case of Morewood v Wakefield 133 Mass 240 the same statute was construed as authorizing any person to kill a dog which was licensed but had no collar on provided that he could do so without committing a trespass although no warrant for the killing of dogs had been issued The constitutional objection against general warrants which was the occasion of so much controversy in that State in its colonial days was held not to apply to dogs and a warrant was sufficient which ordered the killing of all dogs living in a town not duly licensed and collared In Ex parte Cooper 3 Tex App 489 30 Am Rep 152 it was held that dogs were not property within the tax clause of the Constitu tion and that a tax upon dogs was a police regulation and a legitimate exercise of the police power The point was made that dogs being property should under the Constitution be taxed ad valorem as other property was But it was held that the law was not a tax law in its ordinary sense but a police regulation So in Tenney v Lenz 16 Wis 566 it was held that it was a legiti mate exercise of the police power to regulate and license the keep ing of dogs and that the exercise of that power was based upon the idea that the business licensed or kind of property regulated is liable to work mischief and therefore needs restraints which shall operate as a protection to the public In Jenkins v Ballantyne 8 Utah 245 16 L R A 689 the con stitutional question is considered at great length and the provisions of a city charter authorizing the city to tax regulate or prohibit the keeping of dogs and to authorize the destruction of the same when at large contrary to the ordinance and the issuance of a certificate of registration requiring the wearing of a collar by the dog with his registered number thereon and providing that all dogs not so regis tered and collared should be liable to be killed by any personwere valid and were not in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the Consti tution The only case to the contrary to which our attention has been called is that of Washington v Meigs 1 McArth 53 in which a city ordi 205 1897VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER nance of Washington requiring the owner of dogs to obtain a license for the keeping of the same was held to be illegal The substance of the opinion seems to be that if the dog be a species of property which was conceded it was entitled to the protection of other property and the owner should not be required to obtain a license for keeping the same Even if it were assumed that dogs are property in the fullest sense of the word they would still be subject to the police power of the State and might be destroyed or otherwise dealt with as in the judgment of the legislature is necessary for the protection of its citizens That a State in a bona fide exercise of its police power may interfere with private property and even order its destruction is as well settled as any legislative power can be which has for its objects the welfare and comfort of the citizen For instance meats fruits and vegetables do not cease to become private property by their decay but it is clearly within the power of the State to order their destruction in times of epi demic or whenever they are so exposed as to be deleterious to the public health There is also property in rags and clothing but that does not stand in the way of their destruction in case they become in fected and dangerous to the public health No property is more sacred than ones home and yet a house may be pulled down or blown up by the public authorities if necessary to avert or stay a general confla gration and that too without recourse against such authorities for the trespass Bowditch v Boston 101 U S 16 Mouses Case 12 Coke 63 British Cast Plate MIfrs v Meredith 4 T R 794 797 Stone v New York 25 Wend 157 Russell v New York 2 Denio 461 Other instances of this are found in the power to kill diseased cattle to destroy obscene books or pictures or gambling instruments and in Lawton v Steele 152 U S 133 it was held to be within the power of a State to order the summary destruction of fishing nets the use of which was likely to result in the extinction of valuable fisheries within the waters of the State It is true that under the Fourteenth Amendment no State can de prive a person of his life liberty or property without due process of law but in determining what is due process of law we are bound to consider the nature of the property the necessity for its sacrifice and the extent to which it has heretofore been regarded as within the police power So far as property is inoffensive or harmless it can only be condemned or destroyed by legal proceedings with due notice to the owner but so far as it is dangerous to the safety or health of the com 206 JulySENTELL V N O  CARROLLTON R R CO munity due process of law may authorize its summary destruction As was said in Jenkins v Ballantyne 8 Utah 245 247 16 L R A 689 The emergency may be such as not to admit of the delay es sential to judicial inquiry and consideration or the subject of such action and process may be of such a nature or the conditions and cir cumstances in which the act must be performed to effect the protection and give effect to the law may be such as to render judicial inquiry and consideration impracticable Although dogs are ordinarily harmless they preserve some of their hereditary wolfish instincts which occasionally break forth in the destruction of sheep and other helpless animals Others too small to attack these animals are simply vicious noisy and pestilent As their depredations are often committed at night it is usually impossible to identify the dog or to fix the liability upon the owner who moreover is likely to be pecuniarily irresponsible In short the damages are usually such as are beyond the reach of judicial process and legisla tion of a drastic nature is necessary to protect persons and property from destruction and annoyance Such legislation is clearly within the police power of the State It ordinarily takes the form of a license tax and the identification of the dog by a collar and tag upon which the name of the owner is sometimes required to be engraved but other remedies are not uncommon In Louisiana there is only a conditional property in dogs If they are given in by the owner to the assessor and placed upon the assess ment rolls they are entitled to the same legal guaranties as other per sonal property though in actions for their death or injury the owner is limited in the amount of his recovery to the value fixed by himself in the last assessment It is only under these restrictions that dogs are recognized as property In addition to this dogs are required by the municipal ordinance of New Orleans to be provided with a tag obtained from the treasurer for which the owner pays a license tax of 2 While these regulations are more than ordinarily stringent and might be declared to be unconstitutional if applied to domestic ani mals generally there is nothing in them of which the owner of a dog has any legal right to complain It is purely within the discretion of the legislature to say how far dogs shall be recognized as property and under what restrictions they shall be permitted to roam the streets The statute really puts a premium upon valuable dogs by giving them a recognized position and by permitting the owner to put his own esti mate upon them 207 1897208 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July There is nothing in this law that is not within the police power or of which the plaintiff has a right to complain and the judgment of the Court of Appeals is therefore affirmed NOTEIn Virginia sec 3711 of the Code amended by Acts of 18934 p 421 declares that all dogs in the cities of Richmond and Manchester and in the county of Henrico and all dogs listed for taxation in any county or city of the State shall be deemed personal property and may be the subject of petit larceny and malicious or unlawful trespass

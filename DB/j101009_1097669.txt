CONSTITUTIONALITY OF A LAW OF THE STATE OF LOUISIANA REQUIRING DOGS TO BE PLACED UPON THE ASSESSMENT ROLLS AND LIMITING ANY RECOVERY BY THE OWNER TO THE VALUE FIXED BY HIMSELF FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAXATION THE DOG IN QUESTION WAS A VALUABLE NEWFOUNDLAND BITCH REGISTERED IN THE AMERICAN KENNELS STUDBOOK AND WAS KEPT BY HER OWNER FOR BREEDING PURPOSES IT SEEMS THAT WHILE FOLLOWING HIM IN A WALK UPON THE STREETS SHE STOPPED ON THE TRACK OF THE RAILROAD COMPANY AND BEING OTHERWISE ENGAGED FOR THE MOMENT FAILED TO NOTICE THE APPROACH OF AN ELECTRIC CAR WHICH WAS COMING TOWARD HER AT GREAT SPEED AND BEING MOREOVER HEAVY WITH YOUNG AND NOT POSSESSED OF HER USUAL AGILITY SHE WAS CAUGHT BY THE CAR AND INSTANTLY KILLED THE COURT OF APPEALS WAS EVIDENTLY OF OPINION THAT HER OWNER KNOWING OF HER CON DITION SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN HER UPON A PUBLIC THOROUGHFARE WITHOUT EXERCISING THE GREATEST CARE AND VIGILANCE AND THAT THE ACCIDENT WAS LARGELY DUE TO A WANT OF PRUDENCE UPON HIS PART THE FACTS HOWEVER WERE NOT PROPERLY BEFORE THE COURT AND THE OPINION WAS PUT UPON THE GROUND THAT THE STATE LAW WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND VALID AS A POLICE REGU LATION TO PREVENT THE INDISCRIMINATE OWNING AND BREEDING OF WORTHLESS DOGS THE JUDGES ALSO ANNEXED A CERTIFICATE THAT THE DECISION WAS REVERSED UPON THE GROUND THAT THE LAW WAS CONSTITUTIONAL AND THAT NO OTHER POINT WAS PASSED UPON BY THE COMMON

ANIMALS IN WHICH THE RIGHT OF PROPERTY IS PERFECT AND COMPLETE THEY ARE NOT CON SIDERED AS BEING UPON THE SAME PLANE WITH HORSES CATTLE SHEEP AND OTHER DOMESTICATED ANIMALS BUT RATHER IN THE CATEGORY

STITUTIONAL BUT THE COURT HELD THAT IT WAS NOT AN ACT TO TAKE PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC USE OR TO DEPRIVE PARTIES OF THEIR PROPERTY IN DOGS BUT MERELY TO REGULATE THE USE AND KEEPING OF SUCH PROPERTY IN A MAN NER WHICH SEEMED TO THE LEGISLATURE REASONABLE AND EXPEDIENT  IT IS A MERE POLICE REGULATION SUCH AS WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT CON STITUTIONALLY ESTABLISH  TO THE SAME EFFECT

TO BE KILLED ALL DOGS WHENEVER OR WHEREVER FOUND NOT LICENSED AND COLLARED ACCORDING TO OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE WAS WITHIN THE CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITS OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE SUCH ACTS APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN VERY FREQUENT IN THAT STATE AND THEIR CONSTITUTION ALITY GENERALLY ACQUIESCED IN IN THE MORE RECENT CASE OF MOREWOOD V WAKEFIELD 133 MASS 240 THE SAME STATUTE WAS CONSTRUED AS AUTHORIZING ANY PERSON TO KILL A DOG WHICH WAS LICENSED BUT HAD NO COLLAR ON PROVIDED THAT HE COULD DO SO WITHOUT COMMITTING A TRESPASS ALTHOUGH NO WARRANT FOR THE KILLING OF DOGS HAD BEEN ISSUED THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTION AGAINST GENERAL WARRANTS WHICH WAS THE OCCASION OF SO MUCH CONTROVERSY IN THAT STATE IN ITS COLONIAL DAYS WAS HELD NOT TO APPLY TO DOGS AND A WARRANT WAS SUFFICIENT WHICH

CONSTITU TION AND THAT A TAX UPON DOGS WAS A POLICE REGULATION AND A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER THE POINT WAS MADE THAT DOGS BEING PROPERTY SHOULD UNDER THE CONSTITUTION BE TAXED AD VALOREM AS OTHER PROPERTY WAS BUT IT WAS HELD THAT THE LAW WAS NOT A TAX LAW IN ITS ORDINARY SENSE BUT A POLICE REGULATION SO IN TENNEY V LENZ 16 WIS 566 IT WAS HELD THAT IT WAS A LEGITI MATE EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER TO REGULATE AND LICENSE THE KEEP ING OF DOGS AND THAT THE EXERCISE OF THAT POWER WAS BASED UPON THE IDEA THAT THE BUSINESS LICENSED OR KIND OF PROPERTY REGULATED IS LIABLE TO WORK MISCHIEF AND THEREFORE NEEDS RESTRAINTS WHICH SHALL OPERATE AS A PROTECTION TO THE PUBLIC IN JENKINS V BALLANTYNE 8 UTAH 245 16 L R A 689 THE CON STITUTIONAL QUESTION IS CONSIDERED AT GREAT LENGTH AND THE PROVISIONS OF A CITY CHARTER AUTHORIZING THE CITY TO TAX REGULATE OR PROHIBIT THE KEEPING OF DOGS AND TO AUTHORIZE THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SAME WHEN AT LARGE CONTRARY TO THE ORDINANCE AND THE ISSUANCE OF A CERTIFICATE OF REGISTRATION REQUIRING THE WEARING OF A COLLAR BY THE DOG WITH HIS REGISTERED NUMBER THEREON AND PROVIDING THAT ALL DOGS NOT SO REGIS TERED AND COLLARED SHOULD BE LIABLE TO BE KILLED BY ANY PERSONWERE VALID AND WERE NOT IN VIOLATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTI TUTION THE ONLY CASE TO THE CONTRARY TO WHICH OUR ATTENTION HAS BEEN CALLED IS THAT OF WASHINGTON V MEIGS 1 MCARTH 53 IN WHICH A CITY ORDI 205 1897VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER NANCE OF WASHINGTON REQUIRING THE OWNER OF DOGS TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FOR THE KEEPING OF THE SAME WAS HELD TO BE ILLEGAL THE SUBSTANCE OF THE OPINION SEEMS TO BE THAT IF THE DOG BE A SPECIES OF PROPERTY WHICH WAS CONCEDED IT WAS ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF OTHER PROPERTY AND THE OWNER SHOULD NOT BE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN A LICENSE FOR KEEPING THE SAME EVEN IF IT WERE ASSUMED THAT DOGS ARE PROPERTY IN THE FULLEST SENSE OF THE WORD THEY WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO THE POLICE POWER OF THE STATE AND MIGHT BE DESTROYED OR OTHERWISE DEALT WITH AS IN THE JUDGMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS NECESSARY FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITS CITIZENS THAT A STATE IN A BONA FIDE EXERCISE OF ITS POLICE POWER MAY INTERFERE WITH PRIVATE PROPERTY AND EVEN ORDER ITS DESTRUCTION IS AS WELL SETTLED AS ANY LEGISLATIVE POWER CAN BE WHICH HAS FOR ITS OBJECTS THE WELFARE AND COMFORT OF THE CITIZEN FOR INSTANCE MEATS FRUITS AND VEGETABLES DO NOT CEASE TO BECOME PRIVATE PROPERTY BY THEIR DECAY BUT IT IS CLEARLY WITHIN THE POWER OF THE STATE TO ORDER THEIR DESTRUCTION IN TIMES OF EPI DEMIC OR WHENEVER THEY ARE SO EXPOSED AS TO BE DELETERIOUS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH THERE IS ALSO PROPERTY IN RAGS AND CLOTHING BUT THAT DOES NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF THEIR DESTRUCTION IN CASE THEY BECOME IN FECTED AND DANGEROUS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH NO PROPERTY IS MORE SACRED THAN ONES HOME AND YET A HOUSE MAY BE PULLED DOWN OR BLOWN UP BY THE PUBLIC AUTHORITIES IF NECESSARY TO AVERT OR STAY A GENERAL CONFLA GRATION AND THAT TOO WITHOUT RECOURSE AGAINST SUCH

THE NECESSITY FOR ITS SACRIFICE AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH IT HAS HERETOFORE BEEN REGARDED AS WITHIN THE POLICE POWER SO FAR AS PROPERTY IS INOFFENSIVE OR HARMLESS IT CAN ONLY BE CONDEMNED OR DESTROYED

RENDER JUDICIAL INQUIRY AND CONSIDERATION IMPRACTICABLE ALTHOUGH DOGS ARE ORDINARILY HARMLESS THEY PRESERVE SOME OF THEIR HEREDITARY WOLFISH INSTINCTS WHICH OCCASIONALLY BREAK FORTH IN THE DESTRUCTION OF SHEEP AND OTHER HELPLESS ANIMALS OTHERS TOO SMALL TO ATTACK THESE ANIMALS ARE SIMPLY VICIOUS NOISY AND PESTILENT AS THEIR DEPREDATIONS ARE OFTEN COMMITTED AT NIGHT IT IS USUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO IDENTIFY THE DOG OR TO FIX THE LIABILITY UPON THE OWNER WHO MOREOVER IS LIKELY TO BE PECUNIARILY IRRESPONSIBLE IN SHORT THE DAMAGES ARE USUALLY SUCH AS ARE BEYOND THE REACH OF JUDICIAL PROCESS AND LEGISLA TION OF A DRASTIC NATURE IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT PERSONS AND PROPERTY FROM DESTRUCTION AND ANNOYANCE SUCH LEGISLATION IS CLEARLY WITHIN THE POLICE POWER OF THE STATE IT ORDINARILY TAKES THE FORM OF A LICENSE TAX AND THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE DOG BY A COLLAR AND TAG UPON WHICH THE NAME OF THE OWNER IS SOMETIMES REQUIRED TO BE ENGRAVED BUT OTHER REMEDIES ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN LOUISIANA THERE IS ONLY A CONDITIONAL PROPERTY IN DOGS IF THEY ARE GIVEN IN BY THE OWNER TO THE ASSESSOR AND PLACED UPON THE ASSESS MENT ROLLS THEY ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME LEGAL GUARANTIES AS OTHER PER SONAL PROPERTY THOUGH IN ACTIONS FOR THEIR DEATH OR INJURY THE OWNER IS LIMITED IN THE AMOUNT OF HIS RECOVERY TO THE VALUE FIXED BY HIMSELF IN THE LAST ASSESSMENT IT IS ONLY UNDER THESE RESTRICTIONS THAT DOGS ARE RECOGNIZED AS PROPERTY IN ADDITION TO THIS DOGS ARE REQUIRED BY THE MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE OF NEW ORLEANS TO BE PROVIDED WITH A TAG OBTAINED FROM THE TREASURER FOR WHICH THE OWNER PAYS A LICENSE TAX OF 2 WHILE THESE REGULATIONS ARE MORE THAN ORDINARILY STRINGENT AND MIGHT BE DECLARED TO BE UNCONSTITUTIONAL IF APPLIED TO DOMESTIC ANI MALS GENERALLY THERE IS NOTHING IN THEM OF WHICH THE OWNER OF A DOG HAS ANY LEGAL RIGHT TO COMPLAIN IT IS PURELY WITHIN THE DISCRETION OF THE LEGISLATURE TO SAY HOW FAR DOGS SHALL BE RECOGNIZED AS PROPERTY AND UNDER WHAT RESTRICTIONS THEY SHALL BE PERMITTED TO ROAM THE STREETS THE STATUTE REALLY PUTS A PREMIUM UPON VALUABLE DOGS BY GIVING THEM A RECOGNIZED POSITION AND BY PERMITTING THE OWNER TO PUT HIS OWN ESTI MATE UPON THEM 207 1897208 VIRGINIA LAW

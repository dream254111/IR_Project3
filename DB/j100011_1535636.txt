MESODERM OF SERPULORBIS SQUAMIGERUS CARPENTER S J HOLMES THE material upon which the present paper is based was collected at San Pedro Cal in the summer of I895 Work upon it was carried on for a time during the winter of 189596 under Prof C 0 Whitman at the University of Chicago but as the series of stages the material afforded proved incomplete the subject was laid aside in the hope that at some future time when new material could be collected the gaps might be filled Since it is improbable that an opportunity of remedying this defect will soon present itself and as the development of this form shows several interesting points of comparison as regards the formation of the mesoderm with what has recently been found to obtain in other mollusks and certain annelids it was thought best to publish the present account The development of Vermetus a genus from which Serpulorbis is somewhat doubtfully distinct has been studied by Salenskyl in consider able detail According to Salensky mesoblastic pole cells do not appear and the mesoderm in Vermetus arises at a compara tively late period of development by a proliferation from the ectoderm in the region of the blastopore With this conclu sion my own observations do not agree as certain stages that were found afford very clear evidence that the mesoderm arises 1 Archives de Biologie I vi I887 T15 Volume 1 No 3from the posterior macromere D as has been found in so many other cases among mollusks and annelids Serpulorbis squamigerus is a common mollusk on the coast of southern California The shell early loses all traces of its origi nally spiral form and becomes bent and twisted in a very irregu lar way Many individuals are often found tangled together resembling a group of worm tubes and forming masses of con siderable size The eggs are deposited in elongated capsules attached by one end a short distance within the mouth of the shell In addition to the eggs the capsules contain numerous small cells probably follicular which doubtless serve to nour ish the developing embryos A large number of the eggs in each capsule fail to develop normally and sooner or later break up into masses of isolated blastomeres The cleavage of such eggs is irregular sometimes from C the start but often the irregularity appears only after the egg has de veloped for some time in an ap parently normal manner As this departure from the typical path of development occurs at different stages in different eggs it is not always easy to distinguish the nor A   D mal from the abnormal process of FIG IEightcell stage seen from the

yolk At the next cleavage the second quartette of micromeres are given off from the macromeres in a laeotropic direction The spindles appear at one angle of the macromeres but before the next division

direction in preparation for the next ensuing division The appearance of the second quartette is soon fol lowed by a laeotropic division of the cells of the first A dexiotropic cleavage of the second quartette next appears and at about the same time the macromeres bud off the third quar tette in a righthanded spiral completing the separation of the ectoderm from the entoderm The twenty micromeres

half its bulk as their thickness is not nearly so great as that of the large yolkladen entomeres The conclusion drawn by Salensky that in Vermetus there are four quartettes of micromeres produced is doubtless erroneous The cleavage of the first quartette of ectomeres was probably overlooked and the outer products of this division regarded as having had a separate origin from the macromeres A com parison of Salenskys figures with the cleavage of Serpulorbis renders this interpretation probable Besides there are strong reasons for doubting that four generations of ectomeres are ever produced

following divisions have taken place The four upper cells of the second quartette have divided in a laeotropic direction giving rise to the cells 2a11 2bI1 etc which VOL INo 3 SERPULORBIS SQUAMIGERUS CARPENTER I 19 form the tip cells of the arms of the cross The four tip cells are smaller than the others as in Crepidula and Planorbis A cleavage of the four lower cells of the second quartette has taken place likewise in a laeotropic direction The second quartette now contains sixteen cells in four groups of four cells each These cells bear exactly the same relations to each other to the arms of the cross and to the adjacent cells of the other quartettes that they do in Crepidula Planorbis and several other forms at the corresponding stage of development There can be no doubt therefore of their derivation though their actual divisions were not all observed The large ento meres A B and C have divided laeotropically completing the formation of the fourth quartette In place of the mesoblast cell 4 D there is a group of four cells an upper pair containing little yolk and a lower pair of about the same size in which the yolk is abundant The origin of these cells was not followed but there can be little doubt that they all owe their origin to the mesoblastic pole cell They occupy the same area that was occupied by the pole cell The cap of ectodermic cells is radially symmetrical and contains no cells of sufficient size to have given rise to such large cells as the upper pair of the four without altering very materially the symmetrical relations shown in the figure Besides nothing corresponding to such a division is seen in other forms In all probability these cells arose first by a horizontal division of the mesoblast cell such as occurs in a large number of forms and then by a division of the two daughtercells in a plane at right angles to the previous one At this period the egg contains a regular cap of ectodermic cells four entomeres at the vegetal pole three entomeres 4a 4 b and 4 c of the fourth quartette and the group of four cells above described in place of the remaining cell of the fourth quartette 4 d A comparison with the corresponding stage in the egg of Crepidula as shown in Fig 31 of Conklins paper1 shows that the cells of the ectodermic cap correspond point for point and also that the four cells we have derived from 4 d are represented in Crepidula by four cells of subequal size having the same origin andposition The fourth quartette is formed a J ourn Morph Vol xiii 1897little later in Crepidula than the stage shown in Fig 3 I other wise the two eggs are practically identical The four cells in Serpulorbis are all on the surface of the egg and are not over 2d 2 lapped so much by the ectomeres m sj as in Crepidula The

cells lying entirely within the cleavage cavity which probably represent the descendants of the single pair whose origin has just been described The paral  2 M lelism with Crepidula extends also M 2 to this division as the correspond D  ing pair of small cells in that form 4a divides at about the same period  This is as far as the cleavage of  these cells was carried These results were worked out

uncertain what interpreta shown in Fig 5 tion of them should be made It seemed improbable that all of 4 d should form the mesoblast as it was supposed to do in several forms The four large cells showed no signs of passing into the interior of the egg and it is probable that after the mesoderm is separated from the upper pair they enter into the formation of the entoderm as in Crepidula VOL I I 20 HOLMESNo 3 SERPULORBIS SQUAMIGERUS CARPENTER 121 Recent researches render it probable that the cell 4 d is not typically a purely mesoblastic cell As Conklin has pointed out the divisions of 4 d in Umbrella are strikingly like those in Crepidula and strongly indicate as Conklin maintains that this cell contains both mesoderm and entoderm The same cell in Cyclas was held by Stauffacher1 to produce both meso derm and entoderm In Unio Lillie 2 found that the pole cells budded off small cells at the surface before giving rise to the mesoblastic bands and among annelids similar phenomena have been observed by Mead 3 in Amphitrite by Wilson 4 in Nereis and Aricia and by Treadwell5 in Podarke In Planorbis6 I have found that a minute cell is budded off from each of the pole cells before they divide to form the mesoblastic bands It has been suggested by Wilson that these minute cells corre spond to the small entomeres found in Nereis but they are budded off in a different direction and lie in the cleavage cav ity instead of on the surface This does not prove however that they are not homologous with entodermic cells as a slight change in the direction of division of the pole cells would bring them in the wall of the blastula And as they are probably not functional they may represent the last vestige of the ento dermic portion of the mesentomeres 1 Jen Zeit Bd xxviii I893

If the present shortage in the European food supply has reduced the pageantry of dining over there then certainly it is not an unmixed evil The Continental table dhdte system used to be the one best argument for fasting it still is if it still is Three years ago table dhlting on the Continent was a ceremony an intricate and elaborate form of culinary worship that was not only military in its administration but also wellnigh martial in its execution From the anchovies to the creme de menthe vert frappe the diner was kept ever conscious of the system Not for a moment was he allowed to forget the lockstep mastication superimposed by the management of his pension His good digestion what para dox waited not on appetite but on ritual His menu was the beall and the endall of his craving for nourishment Dining for him was become a fetish of formula eating a syncopated symphony as a matter of courseas a matter of many courses His retinue of viands was served d la rag What then was more natural than that syncopated music and syncopated dancing should develop as accompaniments to synco pated feeding  Whatever may be the doubts as to the priority in time of the egg and the chicken there can be no doubt but that the cabaret is the legitimate child of the table dhlte It is but the echo of collec tive gormandizing the consciousness of chewing set en tempo the inevitable tintinnabulation of the music as it wells from the chorus of table dhoters the rhythmic reverberations of gastric gratification in the blissful if blatant consciousness of its bellyhood Such was the distinguished origin of the grabaway cabaret IOI102 THE SCHOOL REVIEW A bell rings A chord is struck In march the stewards to a stately air bearing high the viands of the first despair They may not go they may not come again until the chief rings his bell the musicianeers strike their chord and the stewards mark time in perfect unison Even unto the fifteenth and twentieth genera tions of a single dinner is the ceremony visited in exactly the same manner at exactly the same time per course per day to exactly the same people No mere mortal of a diner dares to be late or the whole domestic machinery may be thrown out of gear and a conference of heads from the scrubberial to the managerial be necessitated The culprit responsible for such a calamity should be made the subject of national scorn For a mere diner to abstain from this viand or that were sufficient cause for exile to Siberia At a certain hour the people throughout an empire must eat fish At a certain time every day the emperor of a kingdom must be able to say to the dining members of his dining council Behold at this moment my subjects are demi tassing Discipline Discipline in matters masticatory as in matters military Discipline in matters intestinal as in matters interna tional Discipline in matters palatable as in matters political Discipline The pompus parade of provender moves apace With many people the table dhote has become more than a habit it has become a state of mind The Teutonic military method is a phase of table dho6te frenzy And this prevalence of the table dhote tendency is not surprising when it is remembered that though efficient as a system it is nevertheless a very lazy a very convenient and therefore a very human way of getting a job done By this system the kitchen force of a establishment tells a man what when where and how he must eat He has to think about nothing whatevernothing that is but a bill at the conclusion of the exercise a tip after that and perhaps probably some equatorial discomfort later on But table dhoting is distinctly an adult process It presup poses a sophistication in digestive operation a tolerance in digestive receptiveness a cosmopolitanism in digestive grasp that the organism of a child could not possibly be possessed ofLITERATURE A LA CARTE 103 Glutton though a child may be he nevertheless objects to having his gluttony librarybureaued The love of selection is a predominant quality of childhood and adolescence Apportion ment that is satisfactory to a young person is a miracle More apportionment made for children by adults that is appropriate and wholesome is as rare as it is miraculous Youth is the d la carte period of life adulthood the table dh6Ite period But the one is always trying to impose his point of view upon the other and the adult being the stronger and the one in authority usually prevails to the greater degree oftentimes to his own embarrassment and undoing Freedom of choice as well as freedom in choice belongs pre eminently to youth and this is so must be so even though the very exercise of freedom may bring pain and cause trouble subsequently If table dh6ting you would go Your appetite must be just so If a la carte you masticate Your appetite may fluctuate Adults are justso people children are fluctuators The regular laidout cutanddried table dh6te perpetuates a monotony of status in the nether physical regions and allows but narrow margins for wholesome contractions and expansions It holds to a monarchical r6gime it assumes assimilation by royal command The free fluctuating catchascatchcan a la carte is as elastic in its possibilities as the digestive organism of youth itself It is accordingly democratic It assumes nothing indeed it often entails anarchy revolution and bombastication of the inards But thento be free A syllabus is an educational table dh6te an adult concoction the ingredients for which are assembled mixed and served for the mental digestion of the young A curriculum is a collection of syllabi in other words a mobi lization of educational table dh6ltes A school is the battlefield of the contending forcesthe place where adult prescription contends with juvenile tactic where table dholte preparedness and a la carte maneuver fight it outIo4 THE SCHOOL REVIEW where strategy in storage and strategy on the spur out do them selves in combat The conceit of adulthood is nowhere more apparent nowhere more assertive than in its formulation of studies for the young It lays out what it thinks pupils ought to study how it thinks youth ought to study and then tries to force the issue It dis regards to an astounding degree the things youth wants It strangely enough forgets its own a la carte period in its table dh6te maturity And thus it renders the educational fare administered both unpalatable and indigestible Color motion animals plants objects pictures contests contrasts freedom yeasit is these youth would order from an d la carte menu in education Compliance exactness abstraction sameness inflexibility nicety books words donts naysit is these adults serve up on their table dh6te menu in education Algebra history grammar and worst of all cutanddried table dhdte readingthese canned products these indigestibles these ptomaines for the adolescent passionists and a la cartists Give them liberty or give them these There is consequently a wholesale foundering and a complete set of hospital schoolsschools for defectives for atypicals for waywards for arrested developments and so on Next in order of establishment must be schools for the haters of reading Reading is a mental and emotional job Reading  la carte is an open job Reading table dho6te is a blindalley job It is with the reading laid out for the young that the syllabists the educational table dhoters do the greatest harm Not liking an edible is the best reason in the world for not eating it Not liking a book is the best reason in the world for not read ing it But certain books must be read for discipline say the table dhoters and so they prescribe adult books and recommend adult methods for their treatment in the classroomLITERATURE A LA CARTE o105 More than thisthey follow out the table dhdte regime to the last measure of its syncopating possibilities Certain books are read and studied at certain specified times and in certain specified ways It is easy to find whole statefuls of children analyzing the same poem at the same time in the same wayand concluding it with the same dislike Not so very long ago a somewhat dis tinguished state superintendent said pointing to a clock in his office Thirtyfive thousand children at this present moment are answering this question He pointed to a question on the examination paper in his hand which read as follows Why did Godfrey Cass desert Molly Ferran  Thus were thirtyfive thousand in the prime of life led to dabble with the crime of life as a result of the educational table dhote by which they had been victimized That theory that extols study primarily as discipline is extremely pluperfect it is held only by the most pronounced table dh6te thinkers To study something just because it will do you good is to take castor oil intellectually or psychologically or both Put into practice in the study of literature such a theory acts as a chronic emetic Pupils in the higher elementary grades and in the high school need the literature that they like need literature d la carte if they are to have any permanent benefit from it or liking for it There are three attitudes among pupils of these grades toward literature and reading The majority do not like the books they are given to read Some are keen to read books other than those used in the classroom A few resign themselves and read thor oughly if not keenly the prescribed books In other words Some hae meat and canna eat And some would eat that want it But we have meat and we can eat And sae the Lord be thankit What is meat for one may be poison for another Literature ai la carte will enable all to have the meat they like and are able to digest and enjoyo106 THE SCHOOL REVIEW Dr Corson of Cornell proved years ago that the one best method of inculcating a genuine love for literature as far as college students and adults are concerned is the a la carte methodthe reading aloud of the best prose and poetry to large groups Professor Copeland of Harvard is today proving the same method to be supremewitness the attendance upon his readings and the afterattack upon the libraries The very same method may be used with highschool pupils is being used with them in certain schools with results that are vastly superior to those under the old table dhdte system Large bodies of pupilssometimes as many as two and three hundred are assembled two or three times a week Literature of their age is read to them along with the high spotsthe youthful spotsin their prescribed books There is no close analysis no highbrow discussion such as the suburban Browning Society indulges when it meets of an evenin to do Brownings The Ring and the Book The aims simply are to inculcate a human attitude toward literature and a natural wholesome sincere appreciation of it The means simply are the auditory appeal the principle of mob psychology and great discernment in the selection and grouping of readings Most of the literature pupils are required to read is too remote from their experience too far removed from their point of view too difficult for their mental digestion The a la carte planmakes it possible for them to start on a simple native fare and to work up gradually to a more complex more ambitious menu Thus Casey at the Bat may be an excellent beginning for a group of readings that deal with the subject of rivalry or contest a subject always near to the heart of youth This may be followed with Fred Emerson Brookss Old Ace this in turn with How They Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix and The Chariot Race from Ben Hur and the series may be fitly con cluded with Pheidippides This last is not always an easy poem for young people it is not always indeed a likable poem But placed at the conclusion of such a series it has been found to work marvels with those very pupils who could not have been reached by it except through someLITERATURE A LA CARTE 1o7 such association They are soon able to see that certain elements in the makeup of Casey were exemplified centuries ago in his Greek ancestor On one definite occasion after reading Pheidippides in this connection they stormed the librarian for more Marathon pomes From some such startingpoint it is an easy matter to get pupils to initiate their own reading groups their squads of stories and poems They are able to construct an a la carte menu in literature that is far better for their emotional enjoyment and intellectual nourishment than much of the stuff served up by their adult benefactors and wellwishers In one large en masse group of pupils it was found that seventeen different nationalities were represented It was suggested that poems or short stories fairly representative of these different nationalities be procured and read The result was most gratify ing and inspiring Mother Goose was present in many dialects and languages Fairies harpies elves trolls kelpies brownies nixies pixies hobgoblins urchins and a host of other invisibles from various lands were likewise on hand It was a promiscuous assembly of literary stars that entertained the group for two or three meetings but the effects were pleasing and instructive beyond all anticipation A few of the other groups that have been worked out with excellent results are here set down Each group was calculated to cover about an hour but as the titles will indicate the work frequently ran over the allotted time A GROUP OF SEA POETRY Kingsleys The Three Fishers Cloughs Where Lies the Land Millers Columbus Proctors The

for en masse treatment The rest of the story is negligible except for purposes of plot connection These salients are served up a la carte as are likewise the best parts of Silas Marner The Sketch Book The House of the Seven Gables The Tale of Two Cities Sir Roger DeCoverley and the rest Poes dictum regarding mere length in a piece of literature bears with particular significance upon the reading aloud of a story or a poem or a play The longer works are all dlacartableLITERATURE A LA CARTE III for purposes of adolescent consumption and are really the better for such cutting The pulsating passages only must be read If less throbbing passages get read too well and good it not also well and good The intensive study of a literature classic never begets an intensive appreciation of that classic It frequently begets an intensive hatred If called upon to parse Miltons Paradise Lost one may get certain satisfactions out of it by way of calling God a mere noun or by pointing out that such a disagreeable thing as a participle may modify the Devil But there are no other satis factions in such a study and certainly there are no benefits to be derived from it But there is a free and wholesome contagion that follows from the ac la carte en masse plan of presenting the gems of literature And the results are vastly more permanent and impressive even though they do sometimes come by the doggerel route The laughs are bigger and grander the weeps are deeper and wetter and all of the emotions between the two are truer and more spon taneous by virtue of the plan and the situation Incidentally the arrangement is economical for one good reader may do the work of four or five teachers This may be why some of them call it literature in mess It is said that literature is a thing of the spirit It may be said then that examinations are a thing of the flesh Who of the flesh shall attempt to examine with success into the things of the spirit therefore  Verily the books that pupils love neither God nor man can fail them in and the books they do not love surely no one wants to pass them in As well examine a Continental diner closely on the food values and constituencies of his table dhlte as to examine a child on the book he has read It is safe to leave digestion to itself if the dinner has been wholesome Children no longer love bad literature if there can be such a paradoxical thing They no longer wallow in the slime of the penny dreadfuls Nick Carter is dead and done withGlory be The better literary fare has been supplied so cheaply and so112 THE SCHOOL REVIEW abundantly that it is almost safe to say that a child may read anything Better than all is the fact that children do not love the seamy sex stuff that even educators serve up to them A teacher who has done the en masse work in literature in a large high school for two years and who has received hundreds of requests to read certain selections has never yet been asked to read a tainted bit has never even been asked about literature of that sort On the other hand he has read to large groups of girls passages of ques tionable delicacy from the prescribed books without any unpleasant reactions whatever and without the slightest tendency toward misinterpretation Queer by the way that the reading recommended by the table dhote adults for the young should have to a book something objectionable in them usually on the sex problem Queer too that in the a la carte treatment of literature in high school this phase does not present itself at all  No The explanation is just exactly the difference between the two systems of dining The table dhote system is narrow and confined and bigoted and artificial it makes the market wait upon its form and formula its variety is limited by tradition its scope by season and locality It seeks out food types and plays them up always in the same dress It thrives upon the storagehouses of the world The a la carte system on the other hand is free and fresh and eclectic widerange in its choice appetizing in its variety waits upon markets and seasons and localities the whole world over and draws from them accordingly It seeks out individual delicacies and plays them up It thrives upon the gardens of the world Now there may be some exaggeration in all this comparison kind reader but it is only the exaggeration of the truth it is not by any means a manufacture from the whole cloth And for cor rective purposes it is as justifiable an exaggeration as is that of the microscope the telescope or the Xray

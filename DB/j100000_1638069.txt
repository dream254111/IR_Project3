orogenic type by them selves novel isostatic youthful appearing The hypothesis of their structure is one of the most brilliant concepts in the history of Amer ican geology at the same time it is one of the most fanciful as the severe testing of a gen eration amply proves Singularly enough the theory had its birth in a district where even its fundamental form seems to be en tirely without representation At this day and distance the extension of the hypothesis to all the socalled faultblock mountains of the arid regions appears to be not only too broad a generalization but quite unfortunate Although I should not wish to be the first to make so sweeping an assertion as lately was done by Dr Spurr that no one has ever seen the faultlines blocking out the desert ranges his statement is almost literally true as all recent critical evidence on the subject fully attests The attractive feature of Gilberts theory of basinrange structure was of course the strong support it was thought to give to the now famous hypothesis of isostasy Concerning some of the fundamental premises I long ago entertained serious doubts It has since been fully shown that there was decided error in determining the degree of completeness of the compensation that invalidated the conclusions With the challenge of the basinrange hy pothesis there has come a demand for citations of concrete examples in support of the theory Thus far after the elapse of a full decade and after frequent repetition of the demand the evidence has not been forthcoming The Cricket Range in Utah recently described in this journal as furnishing a key to the prob lem emphasizes this shortcoming It is not the mere display of profound faulting that is the main desideratum Abundant evidence of this kind is readily found in nearly every one of the desert ranges In the majority of cases such faultings are found to have no relations to the present orogeny Where according to the hypothesis the bordering faults should be they are not but when found they are usually miles out on the intermont plains The pres ent sharp meeting of mountain and plain is now explained by causes other than disloca tion through ordinary streamcorrasion ac cording to Paige or through sheetflood ero sion as urged by McGee Under a title of Locus of Maximum Lateral Deflation in Desert Ranges  I have called attention to its eolative origin By displacement are explained the steep truncations of the transverse ridges of many desert ranges That these bevelments are really faultplanes bounding the mountain blocks will have to be more strongly supported than it is now by direct and unquestionable evidence before the assertion can be accepted These rows of truncated ridges seem rather to mark the lines of battle between the plano rasive advance of eolic degradation from the desert side and the normal streamcorrasion of the more moist mountain areas In the light of the recent advances in our knowledge of the prodigious amount of defla tion which takes place under climatic condi tions of aridity it appears that the generally accepted hypothesis of basinrange structure will have to be abandoned and the origin of the desert mountains ascribed to eolic erosion mainly rather than to local tectonic displace ment CHARLES R KEYES NOTE REGARDING THE RELATION OF AGE TO FECUNDITY 1 IN his valuable book on The Physiology of Reproduction Marshall2 in a section on the relation of age to fecundity says p 590 The fecundity of the average individual woman may be described therefore as forming a wave which starting from sterility rises somewhat rap idly to its highest point and then gradually falls again to sterility There can be no doubt that animals as a general rule tend to follow a similar law

SCIENCESCIENCE A record of the entire breeding history of a rather remarkable ewe of which I made a note some time ago for another purpose illus trates this law in so clear a manner that it seems desirable to publish it with some dis cussion particularly since the place of orig inal appearance of the record is neither readily accessible nor likely to come to the attention of the biologist The record referred to was contributed to the New England Farmed by Mr Chas Mat toon of Lenox Mass The ewe in question was owned by one of his neighbors Colonel Nathan Barrett who at the request of Mat toon drew up the following account I hereby certify that I have owned a native ewe sheep for the space of nineteen years lacking a few days having retained her usual vigor for seventeen years But in the fall of 1822 I ob served for the first time and with no small degree of interest that she slackened her pace and went in the rear instead of front which she continued to do for one year After which having nearly lost use of her eyes and teeth I took her under my immediate care for the last six months until March 1824 when she died with old agehaving given me nineteen fleeces of wool and borne me thirtysix fullgrown lambs viz Lambs April  1806  1 1807  1 1808  2 Apr 3 1809  3 Mar 29 1810  3 Making 6 lambs in 11 months and 26 days 1811  3 1812  3 1813  3 1814  3 Lambs 1815  2 1816  2

possible excluding absolute sterility there is a rather rapid increase to a maximum which is maintained for a time This is followed by a decline in fecundity more gradual than the rise ending finally in absolute sterility Vol III June 3 1825 p 353 227 The case is of especial interest in the present connection because of the fact that it is a completed record carried to the natural end of life of the individual Such completed breeding records are rare for higher animals It is of interest to make certain biometric computations from these data If the age of the ewe is taken as abscissa and the number of lambs born as ordinate one can calculate by the ordinary methods the arithmetic mean point of this animals total fecundity period and certain other constants of interest The only difficulty in making such calculations arises from the fact that no precise statement is made as to the age of the ewe at the time when the published lambing record begins It is altogether reasonable to assume however that a the first lamb recorded is the first one borne by this ewe and b that she was about one year old when this lamb was born These assumptions will be made in the calculating and further it will be assumed that the abscis sal classes throughout center at even years of life Making these assumptions I find a That the arithmetic mean point of this ewes effective breeding life was at 857 years b That the median point in her breeding career was at 817 years That is she pro duced one half of her offspring before that age and one half after it c That the modal breeding point4 i e the point of maximum fecundity per unit of time was at 734 years Taking into account the 17 years in which some young were born I find the following constants regarding the number of lambs per birth Mean number of lambs per birth  212 lambs Standard deviation in number of lambs per birth  76 lambs Coefficient of variation in number of lambs per birth  3578 per cent These are intraindividual constants based on an unusually long and completed breeding 4 Calculated by the approximate relation that the distance from mean to mode is three times the dis tance from mean to median FEBRUARY 7 1913N S VOL

CARBON DIOXIDE IN a previous issue of this periodical I re ported the results of some experiments to de termine the relation of different pressures of carbon dioxide to the rate at which persim mons are rendered nonastringent by means of that gas Two varieties were used in those experiments Taber 129 and Hyakume as these are understood at the Alabama Experi ment Station I had already found that

Persimmons SCIENCE N S 34 924928 December 29 1911 under normal pressure of pure and of approx imately pure carbon dioxide2 these varieties occupied from six to eight days in losing astringency the Hyakume being the slower to respond to treatment Under a pressure of 15 pounds of pure carbon dioxide the period was found to be reduced to less than 46 hours To be more explicit 24 hours was found to be in sufficient for either variety while at the end of 46 hours all astringency had totally disap peared The minimum period required at this pressure was not determined at the time for lack of material It was however quite evi dent that the time necessary to render these varieties nonastringent at normal pressure of carbon dioxide can be reduced to less than one fourth at 15 pounds It then remained until the season just closed to determine these rela tions more accurately and with reference also to still higher pressures It is upon this work that I desire to submit at this time a prelim inary report Meanwhile the results of experiments made by Dr H C Gore3 on the effect of carbon di oxide at normal pressure have appeared The varieties which he studied include Taber 23 and Hyascume so that his results are dis tinctly pertinent in the present connection Gore used a metal receiver especially designed by him to meet practical requirements and as indicated by his controls is doubtless as efficient for exact experimentation as a glass receiver The experiments with Hyakcume were done at Macclenny Fla so that the fruits of this variety were not subject to the exi gencies of transportation As to these condi tions therefore Gores experiments may be regarded as directly comparable to my own which also were done on the ground in metal glass and wooden receivers Gores Taber 23 fruits were processed in Washington As to the numbers of fruits used in Gores experi ments only three of Hyakume were available 2 The protocols of these and the remaining ex periments will be published elsewhere in full 3 Gore H C Large Scale Experiments on the Processing of Japanese Persimmons with notes on The Preparation of Dried Persimmons U S Dept of Agri Bur Chem Bull 155 May 10 1912

S I R A S THE EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS I MEAN TO LAY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY RELATE TO THE SINGING OF BIRDS WHICH IS A SUBJECT THAT HATH NE VER BEFORE BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY TREATED OF  IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO PREFIX AN EXPLANATION OF SOME UNCOMMON TERMS WHICH I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO USE AS WELL AS OTHERS WHICH I HAVE BEEN UNDER A NECESSITY OF COINING TO CHIRP IS THE FIRST SOUND WHICH A YOUNG BIRD UTTERS AS A CRY FOR FOOD AND IS DIFFERENT IN ALL NEST LINGS IF ACCURATELY ATTENDED TO SO THAT THE HEARER MAY DISTINGUISH OF WHAT SPECIES THE BIRDS ARE THOUGH THE NEST MAY HANG OUT OF HIS SIGHT AND REACH  KIRCHER INDEED IN HIS MUSURGIA HATH GIVEN US SOME FEW PASSAGES IN THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE AS WELL AS THE CALL OF A QUAIL AND UCKOW WHICH HE HATH ENGRAVED IN MUSICAL CHARACTERS THESE INSTANCES HOWEVER ONLY PROVE THAT SOME BIRDS HAVE IN THEIR SONG NOTES WHICH CORRESPOND WITH THE INTERVALS OF OUR COM MON SCALE OF THE MUSICAL OCTAVE THIS 7250 THIS CRY IS AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED VERY WEAK AND QUERULOUS IT IS DROPPED ENTIRELY AS THE BIRD GROWS STRONGER NOR IS AFTERWARDS INTERMIXED WITH ITS SONG THE CHIRP OF A NIGHTINGALE FOR EXAMPLE BEING HOARSE AND DISAGREEABLE TO THIS DEFINITION OF THE CHIRP I MUST ADD THAT IT CONSISTS OF A SINGLE SOUND REPEATED AT VERY SHORT INTERVALS AND THAT IT IS COMMON TO NESTLINGS OF BOTH SEXES THE CALL OF A BIRD IS THAT SOUND WHICH IT IS ABLE TO MAKE WHEN ABOUT A MONTH OLD IT IS IN MOST IN STANCES WHICH I HAPPEN TO RECOLLECT A REPETITION OF ONE AND THE SAME NOTE IS RETAINED BY THE BIRD AS LONG AS IT LIVES AND IS COMMON GENERALLY TO BOTH THE COCK AND HEN  THE NEXT STAGE IN THE NOTES OF A BIRD IS TERMED BY THE BIRDCATCHERS RECORDING WHICH WORD IS PRO BABLY DERIVED FROM A MUSICAL INSTRUMENT FORMERLY USED IN ENGLAND CALLED A RECORDER  THIS ATTEMPT IN THE NESTLING TO SING MAY BE COM PARED TO THE IMPERFECT ENDEAVOUR IN A CHILD TO BABBLE I HAVE KNOWN INSTANCES OF BIRDS BEGINNING TO RECORD WHEN THEY WERE NOT A MONTH OLD  FOR WANT OF TERMS TO DISTINGUISH THE NOTES OF BIRDS BELLON APPLIES THE VERB CHANTENT OR SING TO THE GOOSE AND CRANE AS WELL AS THE NIGHTINGALE  PLUSIEURS OISEAUX CHANTENT LA NUIT COMME  EST LOYE LA GRUE  LE ROSSIGNOL BELLONS HIST OF BIRDS P 50  IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A SPECIES OF FLUTE AND WAS PROBABLY USED TO TEACH YOUNG BIRDS TO PIPE TUNES LORD BACON DESCRIBES THIS INSTRUMENT TO HAVE BEEN STRAIT TO HAVE HAD A LESSER AND GREATER BORE BOTH ABOVE AND BELOW TO HAVE REQUIRED VERY LITTLE BREATH FROM THE BLOWER AND TO HAVE HAD WHAT HE CALLS A FIPPLE OR STOPPER SEE HIS SECOND CENTURY OF EXPERIMENTS THIS251 THIS FIRST ESSAY DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE THE LEAST RUDIMENTS OF THE FUTURE SONG BUT AS THE BIRD GROWS OLDER AND STRONGER ONE MAY BEGIN TO PERCEIVE WHAT THE NESTLING IS AIMING AT WHILST THE SCHOLAR IS THUS ENDEAVOURING TO FORM HIS SONG WHEN HE IS ONCE SURE OF A PASSAGE HE COM MONLY RAISES HIS TONE WHICH HE DROPS AGAIN WHEN HE IS NOT EQUAL TO WHAT HE IS ATTEMPTING JUST AS A SINGER RAISES HIS VOICE WHEN HE NOT ONLY RECOLLECTS CERTAIN PARTS OF A TUNE WITH PRECISION BUT KNOWS THAT HE CAN EXECUTE THEM WHAT THE NESTLING IS NOT THUS THOROUGHLY MASTER OF HE HURRIES OVER LOWERING HIS TONE AS IF HE DID NOT WISH TO BE HEARD AND COULD NOT YET SATISFY HIMSELF I HAVE NEVER HAPPENED TO MEET WITH A PASSAGE IN ANY WRITER WHICH SEEMS TO RELATE TO THIS STAGE OF SING ING IN A BIRD EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE FOLLOWING LINES OF STATIUS  NUNC VOLUCRUM NOVI  QUESTUS INEXPERTUMQUE CARMEN  QUOD TACITA STATUERE BRUMA STAT SYLV L IV ECL 5 A YOUNG BIRD COMMONLY CONTINUES TO RECORD FOR TEN OR ELEVEN MONTHS WHEN HE IS ABLE TO EXE CUTE EVERY PART OF HIS SONG WHICH AFTERWARDS CON TINUES FIXED AND IS SCARCELY EVER ALTERED WHEN THE BIRD IS THUS BECOME PERFECT IN HIS LESSON HE IS SAID TO SING HIS SONG ROUND OR IN ALL ITS VARIETIES OF PASSAGES WHICH HE CONNECTS TOGETHER AND EXECUTES WITHOUT A PAUSE V O L LXIII L L I WOULD252 I WOULD THEREFORE DEFINE A BIRDS SONG TO BE A SUC CESSION OF THREE OR MORE DIFFERENT NOTES WHICH ARE CONTINUED WITHOUT INTERRUPTION DURING THE SAME IN TERVAL WITH A MUSICAL BAR OF FOUR CROTCHETS IN AN ADAGIO MOVEMENT OR WHILST A PENDULUM SWINGS FOUR SECONDS BY THE FIRST REQUISITE IN THIS DEFINITION I MEAN TO EXCLUDE THE CALL OF A CUCKOW OR CLUCKING OF A HEN  AS THEY CONSIST OF ONLY TWO NOTES WHILST THE SHORT BURSTS OF SINGING BIRDS CONTENDING WITH EACH OTHER CALLED JERKS BY THE BIRDCATCHERS ARE EQUALLY DI STINGUISHED FROM WHAT I TERM SONG BY THEIR NOT CON TINUING FOR FOUR SECONDS AS THE NOTES OF A CUCKOW AND HEN THEREFORE THOUGH THEY EXCEED WHAT I HAVE DEFINED THE CALL OF A BIRD TO BE DO NOT AMOUNT TO ITS SONG I WILL FOR THIS REASON TAKE THE LIBERTY OF TERMING SUCH A SUC CESSION OF TWO NOTES AS WE HEAR IN THESE BIRDS THE VARIED CALL HAVING THUS SETTLED THE MEANING OF CERTAIN WORDS WHICH I SHALL BE OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO STATE SOME GENERAL PRINCIPLES WITH REGARD TO THE SINGING OF BIRDS WHICH SEEM TO RESULT FROM THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE BEEN MAKING FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND UNDER A GREAT VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES NOTES IN BIRDS ARE NO MORE INNATE THAN LANGUAGE IS IN MAN AND DEPEND ENTIRELY UPON THE MASTER UNDER WHICH THEY ARE BRED AS FAR AS THEIR ORGANS WILL ENABLE THEM TO IMITATE THE SOUNDS WHICH THEY HAVE FREQUENT OPPORTUNITIES OF HEARING  THE COMMON HEN WHEN SHE LAYS REPEATS THE SAME NOTE VERY OFTEN AND CONCLUDES WITH THE SIXTH ABOVE WHICH SHE HOLDS FOR A LONGER TIME 1 MOST253 MOST OF THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE MADE ON THIS SUB JECT HAVE BEEN MADE WITH COCK LINNETS WHICH WERE FLEDGED AND NEARLY ABLE TO LEAVE THEIR NEST ON AC COUNT NOT ONLY OF THIS BIRDS DOCILITY AND GREAT POWERS OF IMITATION BUT BECAUSE THE COCK IS EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM THE HEN AT THAT EARLY PERIOD BY THE SUPERIOR WHITENESS IN THE WING  IN MANY OTHER SORTS OF SINGING BIRDS THE MALE IS NOT AT THE AGE OF THREE WEEKS SO CERTAINLY KNOWN FROM THE FEMALE AND IF THE PUPIL TURNS OUT TO BE A HEN   IBI OMNIS  EFFUSUS LABOR THE GREEK POETS MADE A SONGSTER OF THE  WHATEVER ANIMAL THAT MAY BE AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THEY OBSERVED THE FEMALE WAS INCAPABLE OF SING ING AS WELL AS HEN BIRDS   COMICORUM GRAECORUM SENTENTIAE P 452 ED STEPH I HAVE INDEED KNOWN AN INSTANCE OR TWO OF A HENS MAKING OUT SOMETHING LIKE THE SONG OF HER SPECIES BUT THESE ARE AS RARE AS THE COMMON HENS BEING HEARD TO CROW I RATHER SUSPECT ALSO THAT THOSE PARROTS MAGPIES C WHICH EITHER DO NOT SPEAK AT ALL OR VERY LITTLE ARE HENS OF THOSE SPECIES  THE WHITE REACHES ALMOST TO THE SHAFT OF THE QUILL FEATHERS AND IN THE HEN DOES NOT EXCEED MORE THAN HALF L L 2 I HAVE254 I HAVE EDUCATED NESTLING LINNETS UNDER THE THREE BEST SINGING LARKS THE SKYLARK WOODLARK AND TIT LARK EVERY ONE OF WHICH INSTEAD OF THE LINNETS SONG ADHERED ENTIRELY TO THAT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE IN STRUCTORS WHEN THE NOTE OF THE TITLARKLINNET  WAS THOROUGHLY FIXED I HUNG THE BIRD IN A ROOM WITH TWO COMMON LINNETS FOR A QUARTER OF A YEAR WHICH WERE FULL IN SONG THE TITLARKLINNET HOWEVER DID NOT BORROW ANY PASSAGES FROM THE LINNETS SONG BUT ADHERED STEADFASTLY TO THAT OF THE TITLARK I HAD SOME CURIOSITY TO FIND OUT WHETHER AN EUROPEAN NESTLING WOULD EQUALLY LEARN THE NOTE OF AN AFRICAN BIRD I THEREFORE EDUCATED A YOUNG LINNET UNDER A VENGOLINA  WHICH IMITATED ITS AFRICAN MASTER SO EXACTLY WITHOUT ANY MIXTURE OF THE LINNET SONG THAT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH THE ONE FROM THE OTHER THIS VENGOLINALINNET WAS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT WITH OUT EVER UTTERING A SINGLE NOTE BY WHICH IT COULD HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO BE A LINNET IN SOME OF MY OTHER EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER THE NESTLING LINNET RE TAINED THE CALL OF ITS OWN SPECIES OR WHAT THE BIRD  I THUS CALL A BIRD WHICH SINGS NOTES HE WOULD NOT HAVE LEARNED IN A WILD STATE THUS BY A SKYLARKLINNET I MEAN A LINNET WITH THE SKYLARK SONG A NIGHTINGALE ROBIN A ROBIN WITH THE NIGHTINGALE SONG C  THIS BIRD SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED BY ANY OF THE ORNITHOLOGISTS IT IS OF THE FINCH TRIBE AND ABOUT THE SAME SIZE WITH OUR ABERDAVINE OR SISKIN THE COLOURS ARE GREY AND WHITE AND THE COCK HATH A BRIGHT YELLOW SPOT UPON THE RUMP IT IS A VERY FAMILIAR BIRD AND SINGS BETTER THAN ANY OF THOSE WHICH ARE NOT EUROPEAN EXCEPT THE AMERICAN MOCKING BIRD CATCHERS255 CATCHERS TERM THE LINNETS CHUCKLE FROM SOME RE SEMBLANCE TO THAT WORD WHEN PRONOUNCED I HAVE BEFORE STATED THAT ALL MY NESTLING LINNETS WERE THREE WEEKS OLD WHEN TAKEN FROM THE NEST AND BY THAT TIME THEY FREQUENTLY LEARN THEIR OWN CALL FROM THE PARENT BIRDS WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED TO CONSIST OF ONLY A SINGLE NOTE TO BE CERTAIN THEREFORE THAT A NESTLING WILL NOT HAVE EVEN THE CALL OF ITS SPECIES IT SHOULD BE TAKEN FROM THE NEST WHEN ONLY A DAY OR TWO OLD BECAUSE THOUGH NESTLINGS CANNOT SEE TILL THE SEVENTH DAY YET THEY CAN HEAR FROM THE INSTANT THEY ARE HATCHED AND PROBABLY FROM THAT CIRCUMSTANCE ATTEND TO SOUNDS MORE THAN THEY DO AFTERWARDS ESPECIALLY AS THE CALL OF THE PARENTS ANNOUNCES THE ARRIVAL OF THEIR FOOD I MUST OWN THAT I AM NOT EQUAL MYSELF NOR CAN I PROCURE ANY PERSON TO TAKE THE TROUBLE OF BREED ING UP A BIRD OF THIS AGE AS THE ODDS AGAINST ITS BEING REARED ARE ALMOST INFINITE THE WARMTH INDEED OF INCUBATION MAY BE IN SOME MEASURE SUPPLIED BY COTTON AND FIRES BUT THESE DELICATE ANIMALS REQUIRE IN THIS STATE BEING FED ALMOST PERPETUALLY WHILST THE NOURISHMENT THEY RECEIVE SHOULD NOT ONLY BE PREPARED WITH GREAT ATTENTION BUT GIVEN IN VERY SMALL PORTIONS AT A TIME THOUGH I MUST ADMIT THEREFORE THAT I HAVE NEVER REARED MYSELF A BIRD OF SO TENDER AN AGE YET I HAVE HAPPENED TO SEE BOTH A LINNET AND A GOLDFINCH WHICH WERE TAKEN FROM THEIR NESTS WHEN ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS OLD THE FIRST OF THESE BELONGED TO MR MATTHEWS AN APOTHECARY AT KENSINGTON WHICH FROM A WANT OF OTHER256 OTHER SOUNDS TO IMITATE ALMOST ARTICULATED THE WORDS PRETTY BOY AS WELL AS SOME OTHER SHORT SENTENCES I HEARD THE BIRD MYSELF REPEAT THE WORDS PRETTY BOY AND MR MATTHEWS ASSURED ME THAT HE HAD NEITHER THE NOTE OR CALL OF ANY BIRD WHATSOEVER THIS TALKING LINNET DIED LAST YEAR AND MANY PEOPLE WENT FROM LONDON TO HEAR HIM SPEAK THE GOLDFINCH I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED WAS REARED IN THE TOWN OF KNIGHTON IN RADNORSHIRE WHICH I HAPPENED TO HEAR AS I WAS WALKING BY THE HOUSE WHERE IT WAS KEPT I THOUGHT INDEED THAT A WREN WAS SINGING AND I WENT INTO THE HOUSE TO INQUIRE AFTER IT AS THAT LITTLE BIRD SELDOM LIVES LONG IN A CAGE THE PEOPLE OF THE HOUSE HOWEVER TOLD ME THAT THEY HAD NO BIRD BUT A GOLDFINCH WHICH THEY CON CEIVED TO SING ITS OWN NATURAL NOTE AS THEY CALLED IT UPON WHICH I STAID A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN THE ROOM WHILST ITS NOTES WERE MERELY THOSE OF A WREN WITHOUT THE LEAST MIXTURE OF GOLDFINCH ON FURTHER INQUIRIES I FOUND THAT THE BIRD HAD BEEN TAKEN FROM THE NEST WHEN ONLY TWO OR THREE DAYS OLD THAT IT WAS HUNG IN A WINDOW WHICH WAS OPPOSITE TO A SMALL GARDEN WHENCE THE NESTLING HAD UNDOUBTEDLY ACQUIRED THE NOTES OF THE WREN WITHOUT HAVING HAD ANY OPPORTUNITY OF LEARNING EVEN THE CALL OF THE GOLDFINCH THESE FACTS WHICH I HAVE STATED SEEM TO PROVE VERY DECISIVELY THAT BIRDS HAVE NOT ANY INNATE IDEAS OF THE NOTES WHICH ARE SUPPOSED TO BE PECULIAR TO EACH SPECIES BUT IT WILL POSSIBLY BE ASKED WHY IN A WILD STATE THEY ADHERE SO STEADILY TO THE SAME SONG IN257 IN SO MUCH THAT IT IS IS WELL KNOWN BEFORE THE BIRD IS HEARD WHAT NOTES YOU ARE TO EXPECT FROM HIM THIS HOWEVER ARISES ENTIRELY FROM THE NESTLINGS ATTENDING ONLY TO THE INSTRUCTION OF THE PARENT BIRD WHILST IT DISREGARDS THE NOTES OF ALL OTHERS WHICH MAY PERHAPS BE SINGING ROUND HIM YOUNG CANARYBIRDS ARE FREQUENTLY REARED IN A ROOM WHERE THERE ARE MANY OTHER SORTS AND YET I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT THEY ONLY LEARN THE SONG OF THE PARENT COCK EVERY ONE KNOWS THAT THE COMMON HOUSESPAR ROW WHEN IN A WILD STATE NEVER DOES ANY THING BUT CHIRP THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT ARISE FROM WANT OF POWERS IN THIS BIRD TO IMITATE OTHERS BUT BECAUSE HE ONLY ATTENDS TO THE PARENTAL NOTE BUT TO PROVE THIS DECISIVELY I TOOK A COMMON SPARROW FROM THE NEST WHEN IT WAS FLEDGED AND EDUCATED HIM UNDER A LINNET THE BIRD HOWEVER BY ACCIDENT HEARD A GOLDFINCH ALSO AND HIS SONG WAS THEREFORE A MIXTURE OF THE LINNET AND GOLD FINCH I HAVE TRIED SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO OB SERVE FROM WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES BIRDS FIX UPON ANY PARTICULAR NOTE WHEN TAKEN FROM THE PARENTS BUT CANNOT SETTLE THIS WITH ANY SORT OF PRECISION ANY MORE THAN AT WHAT PERIOD OF THEIR RECORDING THEY DE TERMINE UPON THE SONG TO WHICH THEY WILL ADHERE I EDUCATED A YOUNG ROBIN UNDER A VERY FINE NIGH TINGALE WHICH HOWEVER BEGAN ALREADY TO BE OUT OF SONG AND WAS PERFECTLY MUTE IN LESS THAN A FORT NIGHT THIS ROBIN AFTERWARDS SUNG THREE PARTS IN FOUR NIGHTINGALE AND THE REST OF HIS SONG WAS WHAT THE BIRD258 BIRD  CATCHERS CALL RUBBISH OR NO PARTICULAR NOTE WHATSOEVER I HUNG THIS ROBIN NEARER TO THE NIGHTINGALE THAN TO ANY OTHER BIRD FROM WHICH FIRST EXPERIMENT I CONCEIVED THAT THE SCHOLAR WOULD IMITATE THE MASTER WHICH WAS AT THE LEAST DISTANCE FROM HIM FROM SEVERAL OTHER EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER WHICH I HAVE SINCE TRIED I FIND IT TO BE VERY UNCERTAIN WHAT NOTES THE NESTLING WILL MOST ATTEND TO AND OFTEN THEIR SONG IS A MIXTURE AS IN THE INSTANCE WHICH I BEFORE STATED OF THE SPARROW I MUST OWN ALSO THAT I CONCEIVED FROM THE EX PERIMENT OF EDUCATING THE ROBIN UNDER A NIGHTIN GALE THAT THE SCHOLAR WOULD FIX UPON THE NOTE WHICH IT FIRST HEARD WHEN TAKEN FROM THE NEST I IMAGINED LIKEWISE THAT IF THE NIGHTINGALE HAD BEEN FULLY IN SONG THE INSTRUCTION FOR A FORTNIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT I HAVE HOWEVER SINCE TRIED THE FOLLOWING EX PERIMENT WHICH CONVINCES ME SO MUCH DEPENDS UPON CIRCUMSTANCES AND PERHAPS CAPRICE IN THE SCHO LAR THAT NO GENERAL INFERENCE OR RULE CAN BE LAID DOWN WITH REGARD TO EITHER OF THESE SUPPOSITIONS I EDUCATED A NESTLING ROBIN UNDER A WOODLARKLIN NET WHICH WAS FULL IN SONG AND HUNG VERY NEAR TO HIM FOR A MONTH TOGETHER AFTER WHICH THE ROBIN WAS REMOVED TO ANOTHER HOUSE WHERE HE COULD ONLY HEAR A SKYLARKLINNET THE CONSEQUENCE WAS THAT THE NESTLING DID NOT SING A NOTE OF WOODLARK THOUGH I AFTERWARDS HUNG HIM AGAIN JUST ABOVE THE WOODLARKLINNET BUT ADHERED ENTIRELY TO THE SONG OF THE SKYLARKLINNET HAVING 3259 HAVING THUS STATED THE RESULT OF SEVERAL EXPERI MENTS WHICH WERE CHIEFLY INTENDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER BIRDS HAD ANY INNATE IDEAS OF THE NOTES OR SONG WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE PECULIAR TO EACH SPE CIES I SHALL NOW MAKE SOME GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THEIR SINGING THOUGH PERHAPS THE SUBJECT MAY AP PEAR TO MANY A VERY MINUTE ONE EVERY POET INDEED SPEAKS WITH RAPTURES OF THE HARMONY OF THE GROVES YET THOSE EVEN WHO HAVE GOOD MUSICAL EARS SEEM TO PAY LITTLE ATTENTION TO IT BUT AS A PLEASING NOISE I AM ALSO CONVINCED THOUGH IT MAY SEEM RATHER PARADOXICAL THAT THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON DISTIN GUISH MORE ACCURATELY AND KNOW MORE ON THIS HEAD THAN OF ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THE ISLAND TAKEN TOGETHER THIS SEEMS TO ARISE FROM TWO CAUSES THE FIRST IS THAT WE HAVE NOT MORE MUSICAL IDEAS WHICH ARE INNATE THAN WE HAVE OF LANGUAGE AND THEREFORE THOSE EVEN WHO HAVE THE HAPPINESS TO HAVE ORGANS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF RECEIVING A GRATI FICATION FROM THIS SIXTH SENSE AS IT HATH BEEN CALLED BY SOME REQUIRE HOWEVER THE BEST INSTRUCTION THE ORCHESTRA OF THE OPERA WHICH IS CONFINED TO THE METROPOLIS HATH DIFFUSED A GOOD STILE OF PLAYING OVER THE OTHER BANDS OF THE CAPITAL WHICH IS BY DEGREES COMMUNICATED TO THE FIDLER AND BALLADSINGER IN THE STREETS THE ORGANS IN EVERY CHURCH AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE SAVOYARDS CONTRIBUTE LIKEWISE TO THIS IM PROVEMENT OF MUSICAL FACULTIES IN THE LONDONERS IF THE SINGING OF THE PLOUGHMAN IN THE COUNTRY IS THEREFORE COMPARED WITH THAT OF THE LONDON BLACK V O L LXIII M M GUARD260 GUARD THE FUPERIORITY IS INFINITELY ON THE SIDE OF THE LATTER AND THE SAME MAY BE OBSERVED IN COMPARING THE VOICE OF A COUNTRY GIRL AND LONDON HOUSEMAID AS IT IS VERY UNCOMMON TO HEAR THE FORMER SING TOLE RABLY IN TUNE I DO NOT MEAN BY THIS TO ASSERT THAT THE INHABITANTS OF THE COUNTRY ARE NOT BORN WITH AS GOOD MUSICAL OR GANS BUT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE NOT THE SAME OPPOR TUNITIES OF LEARNING FROM OTHERS WHO PLAY IN TUNE THEMSELVES THE OTHER REASON FOR THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON JUDGING BETTER IN RELATION TO THE SONG OF BIRDS ARISES FROM THEIR HEARING EACH BIRD SING DISTINCTLY EITHER IN THEIR OWN OR THEIR NEIGHBOURS SHOPS AS ALSO FROM A BIRD CONTINUING MUCH LONGER IN SONG WHILST IN A CAGE THAN WHEN AT LIBERTY THE CAUSE OF WHICH I SHALL ENDEAVOUR HEREAFTER TO EXPLAIN THOSE WHO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY ON THE OTHER HAND DO NOT HEAR BIRDS SING IN THEIR WOODS FOR ABOVE TWO MONTHS IN THE YEAR WHEN THE CONFUSION OF NOTES PREVENTS THEIR ATTENDING TO THE SONG OF ANY PARTICULAR BIRD NOR DOES HE CONTINUE LONG ENOUGH IN A PLACE FOR THE HEARER TO RECOLLECT HIS NOTES WITH ACCU RACY BESIDES THIS BIRDS IN THE SPRING SING VERY LOUD IN DEED BUT THEY ONLY GIVE SHORT JERKS AND SCARCELY EVER THE WHOLE COMPASS OF THEIR SONG FOR THESE REASONS I HAVE NEVER HAPPENED TO MEET WITH ANY PERSON WHO HAD NOT RESIDED IN LONDON WHOSE JUDGEMENT OR OPINION ON THIS SUBJECT I COULD THE LEAST RELY UPON AND A STRONGER PROOF OF THIS CAN NOT BE GIVEN THAN THAT MOST PEOPLE WHO KEEP CA NARY261 NARYBIRDS DO NOT KNOW THAT THEY SING CHIEFLY EITHER THE TITLARK OR NIGHTINGALE NOTES  NOTHING HOWEVER CAN BE MORE MARKED THAN THE NOTE OF A NIGHTINGALE CALLED ITS JUG WHICH MOST OF THE CANARYBIRDS BROUGHT FROM THE TYROL COMMONLY HAVE AS WELL AS SEVERAL NIGHTINGALE STROKES OR PAR TICULAR PASSAGES IN THE SONG OF THAT BIRD I MENTION THIS SUPERIOR KNOWLEDGE IN THE INHA BITANTS OF THE CAPITAL BECAUSE I AM CONVINCED THAT IF OTHERS ARE CONSULTED IN RELATION TO THE SINGING OF BIRDS THEY WILL ONLY MISLEAD INSTEAD OF GIVING ANY MATERIAL OR USEFUL INFORMATION  BIRDS IN A WILD STATE DO NOT COMMONLY SING ABOVE TEN WEEKS IN THE YEAR WHICH IS THEN ALSO CONFINED TO THE COCKS OF A FEW SPECIES I CONCEIVE THAT THIS LAST  I ONCE SAW TWO OF THESE BIRDS WHICH CAME FROM THE CANARY ISLANDS NEITHER OF WHICH HAD ANY SONG AT ALL AND I HAVE BEEN INFORMED THAT A SHIP BROUGHT A GREAT MANY OF THEM NOT LONG SINCE WHICH SUNG AS LITTLE MOST OF THOSE CANARYBIRDS WHICH ARE IMPORTED FROM THE TYROL HAVE BEEN EDUCATED BY PARENTS THE PROGENITOR OF WHICH WAS INSTRUCTED BY A NIGHTINGALE OUR ENGLISH CANA RYBIRDS HAVE COMMONLY MORE OF THE TITLARK NOTE THE TRAFFICK IN THESE BIRDS MAKES A SMALL ARTICLE OF COMMERCE AS FOUR TYROLEZE GENERALLY BRING OVER TO ENGLAND SIXTEEN HUN DRED EVERY YEAR AND THOUGH THEY CARRY THEM ON THEIR BACKS ONE THOUSAND MILES AS WELL AS PAY 20 DUTY FOR SUCH A NUMBER YET UPON THE WHOLE IT ANSWERS TO SELL THESE BIRDS AT 5S A PIECE THE CHIEF PLACE FOR BREEDING CANARYBIRDS IS INSPRUCK AND ITS ENVIRONS FROM WHENCE THEY ARE SENT TO CONSTANTINOPLE AS WELL AS EVERY PART OF EUROPE  AS IT WILL NOT ANSWER TO CATCH BIRDS WITH CLAPNETS ANY WHERE BUT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF LONDON MOST OF THE BIRDS WHICH MAY BE HEARD IN A COUNTRY TOWN ARE NESTLINGS AND CONSE QUENTLY CANNOT SING THE SUPPOSED NATURAL SONG IN ANY PERFECTION M M 2 CIRCUMSTANCE262 CIRCUMSTANCE ARISES FROM THE SUPERIOR STRENGTH OF THE MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX I PROCURED A COCK NIGHTINGALE A COCK AND HEN BLACKBIRD A COCK AND HEN ROOK A COCK LINNET AS ALSO A COCK AND HEN CHAFFINCH WHICH THAT VERY EMI NENT ANATOMIST MR HUNTER F R S WAS SO OBLIG ING AS TO DISSECT FOR ME AND BEGGED THAT HE WOULD PARTICULARLY ATTEND TO THE STATE OF THE ORGANS IN THE DIFFERENT BIRDS WHICH MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO CONTRI BUTE TO SINGING MR HUNTER FOUND THE MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX TO BE STRONGER IN THE NIGHTINGALE THAN IN ANY OTHER BIRD OF THE SAME SIZE AND IN ALL THOSE INSTANCES WHERE HE DISSECTED BOTH COCK AND HEN THAT THE SAME MUSCLES WERE STRONGER IN THE COCK I SENT THE COCK AND HEN ROOK IN ORDER TO SEE WHETHER THERE WOULD BE THE SAME DIFFERENCE IN THE COCK AND HEN OF A SPECIES WHICH DID NOT SING AT ALL MR HUNTER HOWEVER TOLD ME THAT HE HAD NOT ATTENDED SO MUCH TO THEIR COMPARATIVE ORGANS OF VOICE AS IN THE OTHER KINDS BUT THAT TO THE BEST OF HIS RECOLLECTION THERE WAS NO DIFFERENCE AT ALL STRENGTH HOWEVER IN THESE MUSCLES SEEMS NOT TO BE THE ONLY REQUISITE THE BIRDS MUST HAVE ALSO GREAT PLENTY OF FOOD WHICH SEEMS TO BE PROVED SUFFICIENTLY BY BIRDS IN A CAGE SINGING THE GREATEST PART OF THE YEAR WHEN THE WILD ONES DO NOT AS I OB SERVED BEFORE CONTINUE IN SONG ABOVE TEN WEEKS THE FOOD OF SINGING BIRDS CONSISTS OF PLANTS IN SECTS OR SEEDS AND OF THE TWO FIRST OF THESE THERE IS INFINITELY THE GREATEST PROFUSION IN THE SPRING AS FOR SEEDS WHICH ARE TO BE MET WITH ONLY IN THE AUTUMN I THINK THEY CANNOT WELL FIND ANY GREAT QUANTITIES263 QUANTITIES OF THEM IN A COUNTRY SO CULTIVATED AS ENG LAND IS FOR THE SEEDS IN MEADOWS ARE DESTROYED BY MOWING IN PASTURES BY THE BITE OF THE CATTLE AND IN ARABLE BY THE PLOUGH WHEN MOST OF THEM ARE BURIED TOO DEEP FOR THE BIRD TO REACH THEM  I KNOW WELL THAT THE SINGING OF THE COCKBIRD IN THE SPRING IS ATTRIBUTED BY MANY  TO THE MOTIVE ONLY OF PLEASING ITS MATE DURING INCUBATION THOSE HOWEVER WHO SUPPOSE THIS SHOULD RE COLLECT THAT MUCH THE GREATER PART OF BIRDS DO NOT SING AT ALL WHY SHOULD THEIR MATE THEREFORE BE DEPRIVED OF THIS SOLACE AND AMUSEMENT THE BIRD IN A CAGE WHICH PERHAPS SINGS NINE OR TEN MONTHS IN A YEAR CANNOT DO SO FROM THIS INDUCE MENT AND ON THE CONTRARY IT ARISES CHIEFLY FROM CONTENDING WITH ANOTHER BIRD OR INDEED AGAINST AL MOST ANY SORT OF CONTINUED NOISE SUPERIORITY IN SONG GIVES TO BIRDS A MOST AMAZING ASCENDENCY OVER EACH OTHER AS IS WELL KNOWN TO THE BIRDCATCHERS BY THE FASCINATING POWER OF THEIR CALL BIRDS WHICH THEY CONTRIVE SHOULD MOULT PREMATURELY FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT TO SHEW DECISIVELY THAT THE SINGING OF A BIRD IN THE SPRING DOES NOT ARISE FROM ANY ATTENTION TO ITS MATE A VERY EXPERIENCED CATCHER OF NIGHTINGALES HATH INFORMED ME THAT SOME OF THESE BIRDS HAVE JERKED THE INSTANT THEY WERE CAUGHT HE HATH ALSO BROUGHT  THE PLOUGH INDEED MAY TURN UP SOME FEW SEEDS WHICH MAY STILL BE IN AN EATABLE STATE  SEE AMONGST OTHERS M DE BUFFON IN HIS LATELYPUBLISHED  TO164 TO ME A NIGHTINGALE WHICH HAD BEEN BUT A FEW HOURS IN A CAGE AND WHICH BURST FORTH IN A ROAR OF SONG AT THE SAME TIME THIS BIRD IS SO SULKY ON ITS FIRST CONFINEMENT THAT HE MUST BE CRAMMED FOR SEVER OR EIGHT DAYS AS HE WILL OTHERWISE NOT FEED HIMSELF IT IS ALSO NECESSARY TO TYE HIS WINGS TO PREVENT HIS KILLING HIMSELF AGAINST THE TOP OR SIDES OF THE CAGE I BELIEVE THERE IS NO INSTANCE OF ANY BIRDS SINGING WHICH EXCEEDS OUR BLACKBIRD IN SIZE AND POSSIBLY THIS MAY ARISE FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF ITS CONCEALING IT SELF IF IT CALLED THE ATTENTION OF ITS ENEMIES NOT ONLY BY BULK BUT BY THE PROPORTIONABLE LOUDNESS OF ITS NOTES  I SHOULD RATHER CONCEIVE IT IS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT NO HENBIRD SINGS BECAUSE THIS TALENT WOULD BE STILL MORE DANGEROUS DURING INCUBATION WHICH MAY POSSIBLY ALSO ACCOUNT FOR THE INFERIORITY IN POINT OF PLUMAGE I SHALL NOW CONSIDER HOW FAR THE SINGING OF BIRDS RESEMBLES OUR KNOWN MUSICAL INTERVALS WHICH ARE NEVER MARKED MORE MINUTELY THAN TO HALF NOTES BE CAUSE THOUGH WE CAN FORM EVERY GRADATION FROM HALFNOTE TO HALFNOTE BY DRAWING THE FINGER GENTLY OVER THE STRING OF A VIOLIN OR COVERING BY DEGREES THE HOLE OF A FLUTE YET WE CANNOT PRODUCE SUCH A MINUTE INTERVAL AT COMMAND WHEN A QUARTERNOTE FOR EX AMPLE MIGHT BE REQUIRED LIGON INDEED IN HIS HISTORY OF BARBADOES HATH THE FOLLOWING PASSAGE  THE NEXT BIRD IS OF THE CO  FOR THE SAME REASON MOST LARGE BIRDS ARE WILDER THAN THE SMALLER ONES  LOUR 6265  LOUR OF THE FIELDFARE BUT THE HEAD IS TOO LARGE  FOR THE BODY AND FOR THAT REASON SHE IS CALLED A  COUNSELLOR SHE PERFORMS THAT WITH HER VOICE  WHICH NO INSTRUMENT CAN PLAY OR VOICE CAN SING  AND THAT IS QUARTERNOTES HER SONG BEING COMPOSED  OF THEM AND EVERY ONE A NOTE HIGHER THAN ANOTHER HIST BARB P 60 LIGON APPEARS FROM OTHER PARTS OF HIS WORK TO HAVE BEEN MUSICAL BUT I SHOULD DOUBT MUCH WHE THER HE WAS QUITE SURE OF THESE QUARTER INTERVALS SO AS TO SPEAK OF THEM WITH PRECISION SOME PASSAGES OF THE SONG IN A FEW KINDS OF BIRDS CORRESPOND WITH THE INTERVALS OF OUR MUSICAL SCALE OF WHICH THE CUCKOW IS A STRIKING AND KNOWN INSTANCE MUCH THE GREATER PART HOWEVER OF SUCH SONG IS NOT CAPABLE OF MUSICAL NOTATIONS THIS ARISES FROM THREE CAUSES THE FIRST IS THAT THE RAPIDITY IS OFTEN SO GREAT AND IT IS ALSO SO UNCERTAIN WHEN THEY MAY STOP THAT WE CANNOT REDUCE THE PASSAGES TO FORM A MUSICAL BAR IN ANY TIME WHATSOEVER THE SECOND IS THAT THE PITCH OF MOST BIRDS IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER  THAN THE MOST SHRILL NOTES OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS WHICH CONTAIN EVEN THE GREATEST COMPASS  DR WALLIS IS MISTAKEN IN PART OF WHAT HE SUPPOSES TO BE THE CAUSE OF SHRILLNESS IN THE VOICE  NAM UT TUBUS SIC TRACHEA  LONGIOR  STRICTIOR SONUM EFFICIT MAGIS ACUTUM GRAMMAR P 3 THE NARROWER THE PIPE IS THE MORE SHARP THE PITCH AS HE RIGHTLY OBSERVES BUT THE LENGTH OF THE TUBE HATH JUST THE CONTRARY EFFECT BECAUSE PLAYERS ON THE FLUTE ALWAYS INSERT A LONGER MID DLEPIECE WHEN THEY WANT TO MAKE THE INSTRUMENT MORE FLAT I HAVE266 I HAVE BEFORE SAID THAT OUR IDEAS OF A VOICE OR INSTRUMENT BEING PERFECTLY IN TUNE OR NOT ARISE FROM COMPARING IT WITH THE MUSICAL INTERVALS TO WHICH WE ARE MOST ACCUSTOMED AS THE UPPER AND LOWER PARTS OF EVERY INSTRUMENT HOWEVER ARE BUT SELDOM USED WE ARE NOT SO WELL ACQUAINTED WITH THE INTERVALS IN THE HIGHEST AND LOWEST OCTAVES AS WE ARE WITH THOSE WHICH ARE MORE CENTRAL AND FOR THIS REASON THE HARPSICHORDTUNERS FIND IT MORE DIFFICULT TO TUNE THESE EXTREME PARTS AS A BIRDS PITCH THEREFORE IS HIGHER THAN THAT OF ANY INSTRUMENT WE ARE CONSEQUENTLY AT A STILL GREATER LOSS WHEN WE ATTEMPT TO MARK THEIR NOTES IN MUSICAL CHARACTERS WHICH WE CAN SO READILY APPLY TO SUCH AS WE CAN DISTINGUISH WITH PRECISION THE THIRD HOWEVER AND UNSURMOUNTABLE DIFFI CULTY IS THAT THE INTERVALS USED BY BIRDS ARE COM MONLY SO MINUTE THAT WE CANNOT JUDGE AT ALL OF THEM FROM THE MORE GROSS INTERVALS INTO WHICH WE DIVIDE OUR MUSICAL OCTAVE IT SHOULD THEREFORE BE RECOLLECTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE CONTENDED THAT THE GREEKS AND ROMANS WERE AC QUAINTED WITH SUCH MORE MINUTE INTERVALS OF THE OCTAVE THAT THEY MUST INSIST THE ANCIENTS HAD ORGANS OF SENSATION WITH WHICH THEIR DEGENERATE POSTERITY ARE TOTALLY UNPROVIDED THOUGH WE CANNOT ATTAIN THE MORE DELICATE AND IMPERCEPTIBLE INTERVALS IN THE SONG OF BIRDS  YET MANY OF THEM ARE CAPABLE OF WHISTLING TUNES WITH OUR MORE GROSS INTERVALS AS IS WELL KNOWN BY THE  THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES INDEED OF PERSONS WHO WOULD WHISTLE THE NOTES OF BIRDS BUT THESE ARE TOO RARE TO BE ARGUED FROM COMMON267 COMMON INSTANCES OF PIPING BULLFINCHES  AND CA NARYBIRDS THIS HOWEVER ARISES FROM MERE IMITATION OF WHAT THEY HEAR WHEN TAKEN EARLY FROM THE NEST FOR IF THE INSTRUMENT FROM WHICH THEY LEARN IS OUT OF TUNE THEY AS READILY PIPE THE FALSE AS THE TRUE NOTES OF THE COMPOSITION THE NEXT POINT OF COMPARISON TO BE MADE BE TWEEN OUR MUSIC AND THAT OF BIRDS IS WHETHER THEY ALWAYS SING IN THE SAME PITCH THIS HOWEVER I WILL NOT PRESUME TO ANSWER WITH ANY PRECISION FOR THE REASON I HAVE BEFORE SUGGESTED I SHALL HOWEVER WITHOUT RESERVE GIVE THE BEST CON JECTURES I CAN FORM ON THIS HEAD IF A DOZEN SINGING BIRDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS ARE HEARD IN THE SAME ROOM THERE IS NOT ANY DISAGREEABLE DISSO NANCE WHICH IS NOT PROPERLY RESOLVED EITHER TO MY OWN EAR OR TO THAT OF OTHERS WHOSE JUDGEMENT ON SUCH A POINT I CAN MORE RELY AT THE SAME TIME AS EACH BIRD IS SINGING A DIFFERENT SONG IT IS EXTRAORDINARY THAT WHAT WE CALL HARMONY SHOULD NOT BE PERPETUALLY VIOLATED AS WE EXPERIENCE IN WHAT IS COMMONLY CALLED A DUTCH CONCERT WHEN SEVERAL TUNES ARE PLAYED TOGETHER THE FIRST REQUISITE TO MAKE SUCH SOUNDS AGREEABLE TO THE EAR IS THAT ALL THE BIRDS SHOULD SING IN THE SAME KEY WHICH I AM INDUCED TO BELIEVE THAT THEY DO FROM THE FOLLOWING REASONS I HAVE LONG ATTENDED TO THE SINGING OF BIRDS BUT IF I CANNOT HAVE RECOURSE TO AN INSTRUMENT VERY SOON  THESE BULLFINCHES ALSO FORM A SMALL ARTICLE OF COMMERCE AND ARE CHIEFLY BROUGHT FROM THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF COLOGNE V O L LXIII N N I CANNOT268 I CANNOT CARRY THE PITCH OF THEIR NOTES IN MY ME MORY EVEN FOR A VERY SHORT TIME I THEREFORE DESIRED A VERY EXPERIENCED HARPSICHORD TUNER WHO TOLD ME HE COULD RECOLLECT ANY PARTICULAR NOTE WHICH HE HAPPENED TO HEAR FOR SEVERAL HOURS TO MARK DOWN WHEN HE RETURNED HOME WHAT HE HAD OBSERVED ON THIS HEAD I HAVE LATELY RECEIVED AN ACCOUNT FROM HIM OF THE FOLLOWING NOTES IN DIFFERENT BIRDS F NATURAL IN WOODLARKS A NATURAL IN COMMON COCKS C NATURAL IN BANTAM COCKS B FLAT IN A VERY LARGE COCK C FALLING TO A COMMONLY IN THE CUCKOW A IN THRUSHES D IN SOME OWLS B FLAT IN SOME OTHERS THESE OBSERVATIONS FURNISH FIVE NOTES VIZ A B FLAT C D AND F TO WHICH I CAN ADD A SIXTH VIZ G FROM MY OWN OBSERVATIONS ON A NIGHTINGALE WHICH LIVED THREE YEARS IN A CAGE I CAN ALSO CONFIRM THESE REMARKS OF THE HARPSICHORDTUNER BY HAVING FREQUENTLY HEARD FROM THE SAME BIRD C AND F AS ONE SHOULD SPEAK OF THE PITCH OF THESE NOTES WITH SOME PRECISION THE B FLAT OF THE SPINNET I TRIED THEM BY WAS PERFECTLY IN TUNE WITH THE GREAT BELL OF ST PAULS THE FOLLOWING NOTES THEREFORE HAVING BEEN OB SERVED IN DIFFERENT BIRDS VIZ A B FLAT C D F AND G THE E IS ONLY WANTING TO COMPLEAT THE SCALE THE SIX OTHER NOTES HOWEVER AFFORD SUFFICIENT DATA FOR MAKING SOME CONJECTURES AT LEAST WITH REGARD TO THE KEY IN WHICH BIRDS MAY BE SUPPOSED TO SING AS269 AS THESE INTERVALS CAN ONLY BE FOUND IN THE KEY OF F WITH A SHARP THIRD OR THAT OF G WITH A FLAT THIRD I MUST OWN I SHOULD RATHER SUPPOSE IT TO BE THE LATTER AND FOR THE FOLLOWING REASONS LUCRETIUS SAYS AND PERHAPS THE CONJECTURE IS NOT ONLY INGENIOUS BUT WELL FOUNDED THAT THE FIRST MU SICAL NOTES WERE LEARNED FROM BIRDS  AT LIQUIDAS AVIUM VOCES IMITARIER ORE  ANTE FUIT MULTO QUAM LAEVIA CARMINA CANTU  CONCELEBRARE HOMINES POSSENT CANTUQUE JUVARE NOW OF ALL THE MUSICAL TONES WHICH CAN BE DI STINGUISHED IN BIRDS THOSE OF THE CUCKOW HAVE BEEN MOST ATTENDED TO WHICH FORM A FLAT THIRD NOT ONLY BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE HARPSICHORD TUNER I HAVE BEFORE MENTIONED BUT LIKEWISE BY THOSE OF KIRCHER IN HIS MUSURGIA I KNOW WELL THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LATE COM POSITIONS WHICH INTRODUCE THE CUCKOW NOTES IN A SHARP THIRD THESE COMPOSERS HOWEVER DID NOT TROUBLE THEMSELVES WITH ACCURACY IN IMITATING THESE NOTES AND IT ANSWERED THEIR PURPOSE SUFFICIENTLY IF THERE WAS A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE ANOTHER PROOF OF OUR MUSICAL INTERVALS BEING ORI GINALLY BORROWED FROM THE SONG OF BIRDS ARISES FROM MOST COMPOSITIONS BEING IN A FLAT THIRD WHERE MUSIC IS SIMPLE AND CONSISTS MERELY OF MELODY THE OLDEST TUNE I HAPPEN TO HAVE HEARD IS A WELSH ONE CALLED MORVAR RHYDLAND  WHICH IS  OR RHYDLAND MARSH WHERE THE WELSH RECEIVED A GREAT DE FEAT RHYDLAND IS IN FLINTSHIRE WE FIND ALSO BY THE ORPHEUS BRITANNICUS THAT EVEN SO LATE AS THE TIME OF PURCEL TWO PARTS IN THE THREE OF HIS COMPOSITIONS ARE IN THE FLAT THIRD N N 2 COMPOSED270 COMPOSED IN A FLAT THIRD AND IF THE MUSIC OF THE TURKS AND CHINESE IS EXAMINED IN DU HALDE AND DR SHAW HALF OF THE AIRS ARE ALSO IN A FLAT THIRD THE MUSIC OF TWO CENTURIES AGO IS LIKEWISE OFTEN IN A FLAT THIRD THOUGH NINETYNINE COMPOSITIONS OUT OF A HUNDRED ARE NOW IN THE SHARP THIRD THE REASON HOWEVER OF THIS ALTERATION SEEMS TO BE VERY CLEAR THE FLAT THIRD IS PLAINTIVE AND CONSE QUENTLY ADAPTED TO SIMPLE MOVEMENTS SUCH AS MAY BE EXPECTED IN COUNTRIES WHERE MUSIC HATH NOT BEEN LONG CULTIVATED THERE IS ON THE OTHER HAND A MOST STRIKING BRIL LIANCY IN THE SHARP THIRD WHICH IS THEREFORE PROPER FOR THE AMAZING IMPROVEMENTS IN EXECUTION WHICH BOTH SINGERS AND PLAYERS HAVE ARRIVED AT WITHIN THE LAST FIFTY YEARS WHEN CORELLIS MUSIC WAS FIRST PUBLISHED OUR ABLEST VIOLINISTS CONCEIVED THAT IT WAS TOO DIFFICULT TO BE PERFORMED IT IS NOW HOWEVER THE FIRST COM POSITION WHICH IS ATTEMPTED BY A SCHOLAR EVERY YEAR ALSO NOW PRODUCES GREATER AND GREATER PRODIGIES UPON OTHER INSTRUMENTS IN POINT OF EXECUTION I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED THAT BY ATTENDING TO A NIGH TINGALE AS WELL AS A ROBIN WHICH WAS EDUCATED UNDER HIM I ALWAYS FOUND THAT THE NOTES REDUCIBLE TO OUR INTERVALS OF THE OCTAVE WERE PRECISELY THE SAME WHICH IS ANOTHER PROOF THAT BIRDS SING ALWAYS IN THE SAME KEY IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THEY DIFFER MUCH FROM THE HUMAN SINGER BECAUSE THOSE WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO SING AT SIGHT OFTEN BEGIN A SONG EITHER ABOVE OR BE LOW THE COMPASS OF THEIR VOICE WHICH THEY ARE NOT THEREFORE ABLE TO GO THROUGH WITH AS BIRDS HOW EVER FORM THE SAME PASSAGES

EXPERIMENTS BEFORE STATED THAT THE UTMOST ENDEA VOURS WILL NOT BE WANTING IN THE BIRD IF HE IS EN DOWED WITH THE PROPER ORGANS IT CAN THEREFORE ONLY BE SETTLED BY EDUCATING A BIRD UNDER PROPER CIRCUMSTANCES WHETHER HE IS THUS QUALIFIED OR NOT FOR IF ONE WAS ONLY TO DE TERMINE THIS POINT BY CONJECTURE ONE SHOULD SUPPOSE IF INDEED M DE BUFFON HAD NOT BEEN THUS INACCURATE THE GRASS AND LEAVES OF WHICH HE SAYS IT IS MADE WOULD PROVE THAT ARISTOTLE SPEAKS OF THE COMMON PARTRIDGE CONTRARY TO WHAT HE HIMSELF SUPPOSES BUT THE STRONGEST PROOF THAT PERDIX SIGNIFIES THE RED LEGGED PARTRIDGE IS THAT THE ITALIANS TO THIS DAY CALL THIS BIRD PERNICE H AND THE COMMON SORT STARNA L THIS ALSO NOW BRINGS ME TO THE PROOFS OF STURNUS IN THIS PAS SAGE OF STATIUS SIGNIFYING THE COMMON PARTRIDGE AND NOT THE STARLING WHICH I MUST ADMIT ARE NOT SO STRONG AS WITH REGARD TO THE IMPORT OF THE WORD PERDIX IF MY ARGUMENTS ARE NOT THERE FORE SO CONVINCING ON THIS HEAD THE NUMBER OF BIRDS TAUGHT TO SPEAK BY THE ROMANS AND NOT BY US MUST BE REDUCED TO THREE AS THE STARLING IS FREQUENTLY LEARNED TO TALK IN THE PRESENT TIMES AS I CANNOT ARGUE FROM THE DESCRIPTION OF THE HABITS OF THE STURNUS OR THE MATERIALS OF ITS NEST AS IN THE FORMER INSTANCE I MUST REST MY CONJECTURE SUCH AS IT IS ON THE TWO BIRDS ALMOST FOLLOWING EACH OTHER IN THESE LINES OF STATIUS ON THE COMMON PARTRIDGE BEING CALLED STARNA TO THIS DAY BY THE ITALIANS AND UPON THE ROMANS HAVING HAD OTHERWISE NO NAME FOR OUR PART RIDGE WHICH IS A VERY COMMON BIRD IN ITALY IF STURNUS IS SUP POSED TO SIGNIFY ONLY A STARLING H I CANNOT THEREFORE BUT THINK THAT PERNIX ACCORDING TO THE READING IN THE PASSAGE OF SILIUS ITALICUS WHICH I HAVE BEFORE CITED IS THE TRUE LATIN NAME FOR THIS BIRD AND THAT IT WAS CALLED PERDIX BY THOSE ONLY WHO UN DERSTOOD GREEK  SEE OLINA VOL LXIII O O THAT276 THAT A SPARROW WOULD NOT IMITATE THE SONG OF THE LINNET NOR THAT A NIGHTINGALE OR PARTRIDGE COULD BE TAUGHT TO SPEAK AND HERE IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER TO EXPLAIN WHAT I MEAN BY BIRDS LEARNING TO IMITATE THE NOTES OF OTHERS OR THE HUMAN SPEECH IF THE BIRDS DIFFER LITTLE IN SHAPE OR SIZE PARTICULARLY OF THE BEAK  THE IMITATION IS COMMONLY SO STRONG THAT  IT SEEMS VERY OBVIOUS WHY THE FORM AND SIZE OF THE BEAK MAY BE MATERIAL BUT I HAVE ALSO OBSERVED THAT THE COLOUR OF A BIRDS BILL CHANGES WHEN IN OR OUT OF SONG AND I AM INFORMED THAT A COCK SELDOM CROWS MUCH BUT WHEN HIS COMB IS RED WHEN MOST OF THE FINCH TRIBE ARE COMING INTO SONG THERE IS SUCH A GRADUAL CHANGE IN THE COLOUR OF THEIR BILL THUS THOSE OF THE CHAFFINCH AND LINNET ARE THEN OF A VERY DEEP BLUE WHICH FADES AWAY AGAIN WHEN THE BIRD CEASES TO BE IN SONG THIS PARTICULAR SHOULD BE ATTENDED TO BY THE ORNITHOLOGIST IN HIS DESCRIPTION BECAUSE OTHERWISE HE SUPPOSES THE COLOUR OF THE BILL TO BE PERMANENT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS SO THIS ALTERATION HOWEVER RATHER SEEMS TO BE THE SYMPTOM THAN THE CAUSE OF A BIRDS COMING INTO SONG OR OTHERWISE AND I HAVE NEVER ATTENDED TO THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE SOFT BILLED BIRDS SUFFICIENTLY TO SAY WHETHER IT HOLDS ALSO WITH REGARD TO THEM A VERY INTELLIGENT BIRDCATCHER HOWEVER WAS ABLE TO PROG NOSTICATE FOR THREE WINTERS TOGETHER WHEN A NIGHTINGALE WHICH I KEPT SO LONG WAS COMING INTO SONG THOUGH THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE COLOUR OF THE BILL BY THE DUNGS BEING INTERMIXED WITH LARGE BLOODY SPOTS WHICH BEFORE WAS ONLY OF A DEAD WHITE THIS SAME BIRDCATCHER WAS ALSO VERY SUCCESSFUL IN HIS PRESCRIP TIONS FOR SICK BIRDS WITH REGARD TO THE INGREDIENTS OF WHICH HE WAS INDEED VERY MYSTERIOUS HE SAID THAT AS HE COULD NOT FEEL THEIR PULSE THE CIRCUM STANCES WHICH HE CHIEFLY ATTENDED TO WERE THEIR WEIGHT AS WELL AS BOTH THE CONSISTENCE AND COLOUR OF THEIR DUNG HE ALWAYS FRANKLY SAID WHAT HE EXPECTED FROM HIS PRESCRIP TIONS AND THAT IF SUCH AND SUCH CHANGES DID NOT SOON TAKE PLACE  MIRE277  MIRE SAGACES FALLERET HOSPITES  DISCRIMEN OBSCURUM HORAT FOR IN SUCH INSTANCES THE PASSAGES ARE NOT ONLY THE SAME BUT THE TONE SUCH WAS THE EVENT OF THE EXPERIMENT I HAVE BE FORE MENTIONED OF THE LINNET EDUCATED UNDER A VEN GOLINA IN MY EXPERIMENT HOWEVER OF TEACHING THE SPAR ROW THE NOTES OF THE LINNET THOUGH THE SCHOLAR IMI TATED THE PASSAGES OF ITS MASTER YET THE TONE OF THE SPARROW HAD BY NO MEANS THE MELLOWNESS OF THE ORI GINAL THE IMITATION MIGHT THEREFORE BE IN SOME MEA SURE COMPARED TO THE SINGING OF AN OPERA SONG BY A BLACKGUARD WHEN THOUGH THE NOTES MAY BE PRE CISELY THE SAME YET THE MANNER AND TONE WOULD DIF FER VERY MUCH THUS ALSO THE LINNET WHICH I HEARD REPEAT THE WORDS PRETTY BOY DID NOT ARTICULATE LIKE A PARROT OR A MINO THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME THE WORDS MIGHT BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED THE EDUCATION I HAVE THEREFORE BEEN SPEAKING OF WILL NOT GIVE NEW ORGANS OF VOICE TO A BIRD AND THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF WILL NOT VARY THOUGH THE NOTES OR PASSAGES MAY BE ALTERED ALMOST AT PLEASURE I TRIED ONCE AN EXPERIMENT WHICH MIGHT INDEED HAVE POSSIBLY MADE SOME ALTERATION IN THE TONE OF A BIRD FROM WHAT IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WHEN THE ANIMAL THE CASE WAS DESPERATE HE FREQUENTLY ALSO REFUSED TO PRESCRIBE IF THE BIRD FELT TOO LIGHT IN THE HAND OR HE THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TIME TO BRING ABOUT AN ALTERATION IN THE DUNG O O 2 WAS278 WAS AT ITS FULL GROWTH BY PROCURING AN OPERATOR WHO CAPONISED A YOUNG BLACKBIRD OF ABOUT SIX WEEKS OLD AS IT DIED HOWEVER SOON AFTERWARDS AND I HAVE NEVER REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT I CAN ONLY CON JECTURE WITH REGARD TO WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN THE CONSEQUENCES OF IT BOTH PLINY  AND THE LONDON POULTERERS AGREE THAT A CAPON DOES NOT CROW WHICH I SHOULD CONCEIVE TO ARISE FROM THE MUSCLES OF THE LARYNX NEVER AC QUIRING THE PROPER DEGREE OF STRENGTH WHICH SEEMS TO BE REQUISITE TO THE SINGING OF A BIRD FROM MR HUNTERS DISSECTIONS BUT IT WILL PERHAPS BE ASKED WHY THIS OPERATION SHOULD NOT IMPROVE THE NOTES OF A NESTLING AS MUCH AS IT IS SUPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE GREATER PERFECTION OF THE HUMAN VOICE TO THIS I ANSWER THAT CASTRATION BY NO MEANS IN SURES ANY SUCH CONSEQUENCE FOR THE VOICES OF MUCH THE GREATER PART OF ITALIAN EUNUCHS ARE SO INDIFFERENT THAT THEY HAVE NO MEANS OF PROCURING A LIVELIHOOD BUT BY COPYING MUSIC AND THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY SO FEW COMPOSITIONS ARE PUBLISHED IN ITALY AS IT WOULD STARVE THIS REFUSE OF SOCIETY BUT IT MAY BE SAID THAT THERE HATH BEEN A FARI NELLI AND A MANZOLI WHOSE VOICES WERE SO DISTIN GUISHEDLY SUPERIOR TO THIS I AGAIN ANSWER THAT THE CATALOGUE OF SUCH NAMES WOULD BE A VERY SHORT ONE AND THAT WE AT TRIBUTE THOSE EFFECTS TO CASTRATION WHICH SHOULD RATHER BE ASCRIBED TO THE EDUCATION OF THESE SINGERS  LIB X C 21 CASTRATION279 CASTRATION COMMONLY LEAVES THE HUMAN VOICE AT THE SAME PITCH AS WHEN THE OPERATION IS PERFORMED BUT THE EUNUCH FROM THAT TIME IS EDUCATED WITH A VIEW ONLY TO HIS FUTURE APPEARANCE ON THE OPERA STAGE HE THEREFORE MANAGES HIS VOICE TO GREATER AD VANTAGE THAN THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SO EARLY AND CON STANT INSTRUCTION CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF MANY SINGING BIRDS IT IS RATHER AMAZING AT WHAT A DISTANCE THEIR NOTES MAY BE HEARD I THINK I MAY VENTURE TO SAY THAT A NIGHTINGALE MAY BE VERY CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED AT MORE THAN HALF A MILE  IF THE EVENING IS CALM I HAVE ALSO OB SERVED THE BREATH OF A ROBIN WHICH EXERTED ITSELF SO CONDENSED IN A FROSTY MORNING AS TO BE VERY VI SIBLE TO MAKE THE COMPARISON HOWEVER WITH AC CURACY BETWEEN THE LOUDNESS OF A BIRDS AND THE HU MAN VOICE A PERSON SHOULD BE SENT TO THE SPOT FROM WHENCE THE BIRD IS HEARD I SHOULD RATHER CONCEIVE THAT UPON SUCH TRIAL THE NIGHTINGALE WOULD BE DI STINGUISHED FURTHER THAN THE MAN IT MUST HAVE STRUCK EVERY ONE THAT IN PASSING UNDER A HOUSE WHERE THE WINDOWS ARE SHUT THE SING ING OF A BIRD IS EASILY HEARD WHEN AT THE SAME TIME A CONVERSATION CANNOT BE SO THOUGH AN ANI MATED ONE MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE NOT ATTENDED TO THE NOTES OF BIRDS SUPPOSE THAT THOSE OF EVERY SPECIES SING  MONS DE BUFFON SAYS THAT THE QUADRUPED WHICH HE TERMS THE HUARINE MAY BE HEARD AT THE DISTANCE OF A LEAGUE ORNITH TOM I EXACTLY280 EXACTLY THE SAME NOTES AND PASSAGES WHICH IS BY NO MEANS TRUE THOUGH IT IS ADMITTED THAT THERE IS A GE NERAL RESEMBLANCE THUS THE LONDON BIRDCATCHERS PREFER THE SONG OF THE KENTISH GOLDFINCHES BUT ESSEX CHAFFINCHES AND WHEN THEY SELL THE BIRD TO THOSE WHO CAN THUS DISTINGUISH INFORM THE BUYER THAT IT HATH SUCH A NOTE WHICH IS VERY WELL UNDERSTOOD BETWEEN THEM  SOME OF THE NIGHTINGALE FANCIERS ALSO PREFER A SURRY BIRD TO THOSE OF MIDDLESEX  THESE DIFFERENCES IN THE SONG OF BIRDS OF THE SAME SPECIES CANNOT PERHAPS BE COMPARED TO ANY THING MORE APPOSITE THAN THE VARIETIES OF PROVINCIAL DIALECTS THE NIGHTINGALE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FIXED UPON ALMOST UNIVERSALLY AS THE MOST CAPITAL OF SINGING BIRDS WHICH SUPERIORITY IT CERTAINLY MAY BOLDLY CHALLENGE ONE REASON HOWEVER OF THIS BIRDS BEING  THESE ARE THE NAMES WHICH THEY GIVE TO SOME OF THE NIGHT INGALES NOTES SWEET SWEET JUG JUG SWEET WATER BUBBLE PIPE RATTLE BELL PIPE SCROTY SKEG SKEG SKEG SWAT SWAT SWATY WHITLOW WHITLOW WHITLOW FROM SOME DISTANT AFFINITY TO SUCH WORDS  MR HENSHAW INFORMS US THAT NIGHTINGALES IN DENMARK ARE NOT HEARD TILL MAY AND THAT THEIR NOTES ARE NOT SO SWEET OR VA RIOUS AS WITH US DR BIRCHS HISTORY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY VOL III P 189 WHILST MR FLETCHER WHO WAS MINISTER FROM Q ELIZABETH TO RUSSIA SAYS THAT THE NIGHTINGALES IN THAT PART OF THE WORLD HAVE A FINER NOTE THAN OURS SEE FLETCHERS LIFE IN THE BIOGRAPHIA BRITANNICA I NEVER COULD BELIEVE WHAT IS COMMONLY ASSERTED THAT THE CZAR PETER WAS AT A CONSIDERABLE EXPENCE TO INTRODUCE SINGING BIRDS NEAR PETERSBURGH BECAUSE IT APPEARS BY THE FAUNA SUECICA THAT THEY HAVE IN THOSE LATITUDES MOST OF THE SAME BIRDS WITH THOSE OF ENGLAND MORE281 MORE ATTENDED TO THAN OTHERS IS THAT IT SINGS IN THE NIGHT  HENCE SHAKESPEARE SAYS  THE NIGHTINGALE IF SHE SHOULD SING BY DAY  WHEN EVERY GOOSE IS CACKLING WOULD BE THOUGHT  NO BETTER A MUSICIAN THAN THE WREN THE SONG OF THIS BIRD HATH BEEN DESCRIBED AND EXPATIATED UPON BY SEVERAL WRITERS PARTICULARLY PLINY AND STRADA AS I MUST OWN HOWEVER THAT I CANNOT AFFIX ANY PRECISE IDEAS TO EITHER OF THESE CELEBRATED DESCRIPTIONS AND AS I ONCE KEPT A VERY FINE BIRD OF THIS SORT FOR THREE YEARS WITH VERY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ITS SONG I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO DO IT THE BEST JUSTICE I AM CA PABLE OF IN THE FIRST PLACE ITS TONE IS INFINITELY MORE MEL LOW THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER BIRD THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME BY A PROPER EXERTION OF ITS MUSICAL POWERS IT CAN BE EXCESSIVELY BRILLIANT WHEN THIS BIRD SANG ITS SONG ROUND IN ITS WHOLE COMPASS I HAVE OBSERVED SIXTEEN DIFFERENT BEGINNINGS AND CLOSES AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE INTERMEDIATE NOTES WERE COMMONLY VARIED IN THEIR SUCCESSION WITH SUCH JUDGMENT AS TO PRODUCE A MOST PLEASING VARIETY THE BIRD WHICH APPROACHES NEAREST TO THE EXCEL LENCE OF THE NIGHTINGALE IN THIS RESPECT IS THE SKY LARK BUT THEN THE TONE IS INFINITELY INFERIOR IN POINT OF MELLOWNESS MOST OTHER SINGING BIRDS HAVE NOT ABOVE FOUR OR FIVE CHANGES  THE WOODLARK AND REEDSPARROW SING LIKEWISE IN THE NIGHT AND FROM HENCE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF SHREWSBURY THE LATTER HATH OBTAINED THE NAME OF THE WILLOWNIGHTINGALE NIGHTINGALES HOWEVER AND THESE TWO OTHER BIRDS SING ALO IN THE DAY BUT ARE NOT THEN DISTINGUISHED IN THE GENERAL CONCERT 7 THE282 THE NEXT POINT OF SUPERIORITY IN A NIGHTINGALE IS ITS CONTINUANCE OF SONG WITHOUT A PAUSE WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED SOMETIMES NOT TO BE LESS THAN TWENTY SECONDS WHENEVER RESPIRATION HOWEVER BECAME NECESSARY IT WAS TAKEN WITH AS MUCH JUDGMENT AS BY AN OPERA SINGER THE SKYLARK AGAIN IN THIS PARTICULAR IS ONLY SE COND TO THE NIGHTINGALE   I SHALL HERE INSERT A TABLE BY WHICH THE COMPARATIVE MERIT OF THE BRITISH SINGING BIRDS MAY BE EXAMINED THE IDEA OF WHICH I HAVE BORROWED FROM MONS DE PILES IN HIS COURS DE PEINTURE PAR PRINCIPES I SHALL NOT BE SURPRIZED HOWEVER IF AS HE SUG GESTS MANY MAY DISAGREE WITH ME ABOUT PARTICULAR BIRDS AS HE SUPPOSES THEY WILL DO WITH HIM CONCERNING THE MERITS OF PAINTERS AS I HAVE FIVE

SHORT AND LOUD JERKS WHICH CONSEQUENTLY CANNOT BE COMPARED TO THE NOTES OF A CAGED BIRD AS THE INSTRUMENT IS OVERSTRAINED I MUST ALSO HERE OBSERVE THAT MY NIGHTINGALE WAS A VERY CAPITAL BIRD FOR SOME OF THEM ARE SO VASTLY INFERIOR THAT THE BIRDFANCIERS WILL NOT KEEP THEM BRANDING THEM WITH THE NAME OF FRENCH MEN  BUT IT IS NOT ONLY IN TONE AND VARIETY THAT THE NIGHTINGALE EXCELLS THE BIRD ALSO SINGS IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF WITH SUPERIOR JUDGEMENT AND TASTE I HAVE THEREFORE COMMONLY OBSERVED THAT MY NIGHTINGALE BEGAN SOFTLY LIKE THE ANCIENT ORATORS I HAVE MADE NO MENTION OF THE BULFINCH IN THIS TABLE WHICH IS COMMONLY CONSIDERED AS A SINGING BIRD BECAUSE ITS WILD NOTE WITHOUT INSTRUCTION IS A MOST JARRING AND DISAGREEABLE NOISE I HAVE LIKEWISE OMITTED  THE REDSTART WHICH IS CALLED BY THE FRENCH LE ROSSIGNOL DE MURAILLE AS I AM NOT SUFFICIENTLY AC QUAINTED WITH ITS SONG THOUGH IT IS ADMIRED BY MANY I SHOULD RATHER CONCEIVE HOWEVER WITH ZINANNI THAT THERE IS NO VERY EXTRAORDINARY MERIT IN THE NOTES THE LONDON BIRDCATCHERS ALSO SELL SOMETIMES THE YELLOW HAMMER TWITE AND BRAMBLING M AS SINGING BIRDS BUT NONE OF THESE WILL COME WITHIN MY DEFINITION OF WHAT MAY BE DEEMED SO  ONE SHOULD SUPPOSE FROM THIS THAT THE NIGHTINGALECATCH ERS HAD HEARD MUCH OF THE FRENCH MUSIC WHICH IS POSSIBLY THE CASE AS SOME OF THEM LIVE IN SPITTALFIELDS  IL CULO RANZO E UN UCELLO PER QUANTO DICONO

ASTONISHING EFFECT AND WHICH ELUDES ALL VERBAL DESCRIPTION I HAVE INDEED TAKEN DOWN CERTAIN PASSAGES WHICH MAY BE REDUCED TO OUR MUSICAL INTERVALS BUT THOUGH BY THESE MEANS ONE MAY FORM AN IDEA OF SOME OF THE NOTES USED YET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE THEIR COMPA RATIVE DURATIONS IN POINT OF MUSICAL TUNE UPON WHICH THE WHOLE EFFECT MUST DEPEND I ONCE PROCURED A VERY CAPITAL PLAYER ON THE FLUTE TO EXECUTE THE NOTES WHICH KIRCHER HATH ENGRAVED IN HIS MUSURGIA AS BEING USED BY THE NIGHTINGALE WHEN FROM WANT OF NOT BEING ABLE TO SETTLE THEIR COMPARATIVE DURATION IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO OBSERVE ANY TRACES ALMOST OF THE NIGHTINGALES SONG IT MAY NOT BE IMPROPER HERE TO CONSIDER WHETHER THE NIGHTINGALE MAY NOT HAVE A VERY FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR IN THE AMERICAN MOCKINGBIRD  THOUGH ALMOST ALL TRAVELLERS AGREE THAT THE CONCERT IN THE EUROPEAN WOODS IS SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE GLOBE  AS BIRDS ARE NOW ANNUALLY IMPORTED IN GREAT NUM BERS FROM ASIA AFRICA AND AMERICA I HAVE FRE QUENTLY ATTENDED TO THEIR NOTES BOTH SINGLY AND IN CONCERT WHICH ARE CERTAINLY NOT TO BE COMPARED TO THOSE OF EUROPE THOMSON THE POET WHOSE OBSERVATIONS IN NA TURAL HISTORY ARE MUCH TO BE DEPENDED

BRILLIANT AND PLEASING SONG A MOST BEAUTIFUL VARIETY OF COLOURS IN ITS FEATHERS  IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT FOREIGN BIRDS WHEN BROUGHT TO EUROPE ARE OFTEN HEARD TO A GREAT DISAD VANTAGE AS MANY OF THEM FROM THEIR GREAT TAME NESS HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN BROUGHT UP BY HAND THE CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH I HAVE ALREADY STATED FROM SE VERAL EXPERIMENTS THE SOFTBILLED BIRDS ALSO CANNOT BE WELL BROUGHT OVER AS THE SUCCEDANEUM FOR INSECTS THEIR COMMON FOOD IS FRESH MEAT AND PARTICULARLY THE HEARTS OF ANIMALS I HAVE HAPPENED HOWEVER TO HEAR THE AMERICAN MOCKINGBIRD IN GREAT PERFECTION AT MESS VOGLES AND SCOTTS IN LOVELANE EASTCHEAP THIS BIRD IS BELIEVED TO BE STILL LIVING AND HATH BEEN IN ENGLAND THESE SIX YEARS DURING THE SPACE OF A MINUTE HE IMITATED THE WOODLARK CHAFFINCH BLACKBIRD THRUSH AND SPARROW I WAS TOLD ALSO THAT HE WOULD BARK LIKE A DOG SO THAT THE BIRD SEEMS TO HAVE NO CHOICE IN HIS IMITATIONS THOUGH HIS PIPE COMES NEAREST TO OUR NIGHTINGALE OF ANY BIRD I HAVE YET MET WITH WITH REGARD TO THE ORIGINAL NOTES HOWEVER OF THIS BIRD WE ARE STILL AT A LOSS AS THIS CAN ONLY BE  I CANNOT BUT THINK THAT THERE WOULD BE A DEMAND FOR THESE BIRDS IN CHINA AS THE INHABITANTS ARE VERY SEDENTARY AND BIRD CAGES ARE COMMONLY REPRESENTED AS HANGING IN THEIR ROOMS HAVE BEEN INFORMED BY A TYROLEZE THAT HIS BEST MARKET FOR CANARY BIRDS WAS CONSTANTINOPLE P P 2 KNOWN286 KNOWN BY THOSE WHO ARE ACCURATELY ACQUAINTED WITH THE SONG OF THE OTHER AMERICAN BIRDS KALM INDEED INFORMS US THAT THE NATURAL SONG IS EXCELLENT  BUT THIS TRAVELLER SEEMS NOT TO HAVE BEEN LONG ENOUGH IN AMERICA TO HAVE DISTINGUISHED WHAT WERE THE GENUINE NOTES WITH US MIMICS DO NOT OFTEN SUCCEED BUT IN IMITATIONS I HAVE LITTLE DOUBT HOWEVER BUT THAT THIS BIRD WOULD BE FULLY EQUAL TO THE SONG OF THE NIGHTINGALE IN ITS WHOLE COMPASS BUT THEN FROM THE ATTENTION WHICH THE MOCKER PAYS TO ANY OTHER SORT OF DISAGREE ABLE NOISES THESE CAPITAL NOTES WOULD BE ALWAYS DE BASED BY A BAD MIXTURE WE HAVE ONE MOCKING BIRD IN ENGLAND WHICH IS THE SKYLARK AS CONTRARY TO A GENERAL OBSERVATION I HAVE BEFORE MADE THIS BIRD WILL CATCH THE NOTE OF ANY OTHER WHICH HANGS NEAR IT EVEN AFTER THE SKY LARK NOTE IS FIXED FOR THIS REASON THE BIRDFANCIERS OFTEN PLACE THE SKYLARK NEXT ONE WHICH HATH NOT BEEN LONG CAUGHT IN ORDER AS THEY TERM IT TO KEEP THE CAGED SKYLARK HONEST THE QUESTION INDEED MAY BE ASKED WHY THE WILD SKYLARK WITH THESE POWERS OF IMITATION EVER ADHERES TO THE PARENTAL NOTE BUT IT MUST BE RECOL LECTED THAT A BIRD WHEN AT LIBERTY IS FOR EVER SHIFTING ITS PLACE AND CONSEQUENTLY DOES NOT HEAR THE SAME NOTES ETERNALLY REPEATED AS WHEN IT HANGS IN A CAGE NEAR ANOTHER IN A WILD STATE THEREFORE THE SKYLARK ADHERES TO THE PARENTAL NOTES AS THE PARENT COCK AT TENDS THE YOUNG ONES AND IS HEARD BY THEM FOR SO CONSIDERABLE A TIME  VOL I P 219 I AM287 I AM AWARE ALSO THAT IT MAY BE ASKED HOW BIRDS ORIGINALLY CAME BY THE NOTES WHICH ARE PECULIAR TO EACH SPECIES MY ANSWER HOWEVER TO THIS IS THAT THE ORIGIN OF THE NOTES OF BIRDS TOGETHER WITH ITS GRA DUAL PROGRESS IS AS DIFFICULT TO BE TRACED AS THAT OF THE DIFFERENT LANGUAGES IN NATIONS THE LOSS OF THE PARENTCOCK AT THE CRITICAL TIME FOR INSTRUCTION HATH UNDOUBTEDLY PRODUCED THOSE VA RIETIES WHICH I HAVE BEFORE OBSERVED ARE IN THE SONG OF EACH SPECIES BECAUSE THEN THE NESTLING HATH EI THER ATTENDED TO THE SONG OF SOME OTHER BIRDS OR PERHAPS INVENTED SOME NEW NOTES OF ITS OWN WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS PERPETUATED FROM GENERATION TO GENE RATION TILL SIMILAR ACCIDENTS PRODUCE OTHER ALTERA TIONS THE ORGANS OF SOME BIRDS ALSO ARE PROBABLY SO DEFECTIVE THAT THEY CANNOT IMITATE PROPERLY THE PARENTAL NOTE AS SOME MEN CAN NEVER ARTICULATE AS THEY SHOULD DO SUCH DEFECTS IN THE PARENT BIRD MUST AGAIN OCCASION VARIETIES BECAUSE THESE DEFECTS WILL BE CONTINUED TO THEIR DESCENDANTS WHO AS I BEFORE HAVE PROVED WILL ONLY ATTEND TO THE PA RENTAL SONG SOME OF THESE DESCENDANTS ALSO MAY HAVE IMPERFECT ORGANS WHICH WILL AGAIN MULTIPLY VARIETIES IN THE SONG THE TRUTH IS AS I BEFORE OBSERVED THAT SCARCELY ANY TWO BIRDS OF THE SAME SPECIES HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME NOTES IF THEY ARE ACCURATELY ATTENDED TO THOUGH THERE IS A GENERAL RESEMBLANCE THUS MOST PEOPLE SEE NO DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ONE SHEEP AND ANOTHER WHEN A LARGE FLOCK IS BEFORE THEM THE SHEPHERD HOWEVER KNOWS EACH OF THEM AND CAN SWEAR TO THEM IF THEY ARE LOST AS CAN THE LINCOLNSHIRE GOSHERD TO EACH GOOE AS288 AS I NOW DRAW TOWARDS A CONCLUSION OF BOTH MY EXPERIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS ON THE SINGING OF BIRDS IT MAY BE POSSIBLY ASKED WHAT USE RESULTS EITHER FROM THE TROUBLE OR EXPENCE WHICH THEY HAVE COST ME BOTH OF WHICH I ADMIT TO HAVE BEEN CONSIDERABLE I WILL READILY OWN THAT NO VERY IMPORTANT AD VANTAGES CAN BE DERIVED FROM THEM AND YET I SHALL NOT DECLINE SUGGESTING WHAT LITTLE PROFIT THEY MAY POSSIBLY BE OF THOUGH AT BEST THEY SHOULD RATHER BE CONSIDERED AS WHAT LORD BACON TERMS EXPERIMENTS OF LIGHT THAN OF FRUIT IN THE FIRST PLACE THERE IS NO BETTER METHOD OF IN VESTIGATING THE HUMAN FACULTIES THAN BY A COMPA RION WITH THOSE OF ANIMALS PROVIDED WE MAKE IT WITHOUT A MOST UNGRATEFUL WISH OF LOWERING OUR SELVES IN THAT DISTINGUISHED SITUATION IN WHICH WE ARE PLACED THUS WE ARE REFERRED TO THE ANT FOR AN EXAMPLE OF INDUSTRY AND FORESIGHT BECAUSE IT PROVIDES A MAGA ZINE OF FOOD FOR THE WINTER WHEN THIS ANIMAL IS IN A STATE OF TORPIDITY DURING THAT SEASON NOR ARE WE LESS WILLING TO SUPPOSE THE SONG OF BIRDS TO BE SUPE RIOR TO OUR OWN MUSICAL POWERS THE NOTES OF MANY BIRDS ARE CERTAINLY VERY PLEA SING BUT CAN BY NO MEANS STAND IN COMPETITION EI THER WITH THE HUMAN VOICE OR OUR WORST MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS NOT ONLY FROM WANT OF THE STRIKING EF FECTS OF HARMONY IN MANY EXCELLENT COMPOSITIONS BUT BECAUSE EVEN WHEN COMPARED TO OUR SIMPLE MELODY EXPRESSION IS WANTING WITHOUT WHICH MUSIC IS SO LANGUID AND INANIMATE  THE NIGHTINGALE INDEED IS PERHAPS AN EXCEPTION TO THIS GENERAL OBSERVATION BUT289 BUT TO RETURN TO THE USES SUCH AS THEY ARE WHICH MAY ARISE FROM ATTENDING TO THE SONG OF BIRDS OR FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST OF THESE IS TOO MUCH NEGLECTED BY THE NATURALIST FOR IF THE BIRD IS NOT CAUGHT THE ONLY MEANS OFTEN BY WHICH EITHER THE SEX OR THE SPECIES CAN BE DETERMINED IS THE SONG FOR EXAMPLE IF MONS ADANSON HAD INFORMED US WHETHER THE EURO PEAN SWALLOWS WHICH HE CONCEIVED WERE TO BE SEEN DURING THE WINTER AT SENEGAL HAD THE SAME NOTES WITH THOSE OF EUROPE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GOING ONE STEP FURTHER IN PROOF OF THE FACTS WHICH HE AND OTHERS SO MUCH RELY UPON THESE EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER MAY BE SAID TO BE USEFUL TO ALL THOSE WHO HAPPEN TO BE PLEASED WITH SING ING BIRDS BECAUSE IT IS CLEAR THAT BY EDUCATING A BIRD UNDER SEVERAL SORTS WE MAY OFTEN MAKE SUCH A MIXTURE AS TO IMPROVE THE NOTES WHICH THEY WOULD HAVE LEARNED IN A WILD STATE IT RESULTS ALSO FROM THE EXPERIMENT OF THE LINNET BEING EDUCATED UNDER THE VENGOLINA THAT WE MAY INTRODUCE THE NOTES OF ASIA AFRICA AND AMERICA INTO OUR OWN WOODS BECAUSE IF THAT LINNET HAD BEEN SET AT LIBERTY  THE NESTLINGS OF THE NEXT SEASON WOULD HAVE ADHERED TO THE VENGOLINA SONG WHO WOULD AGAIN TRANSMIT IT TO THEIR DESCENDANTS  I KNOW WELL THAT IT IS COMMONLY SUPPOSED IF YOU SET A CAGED BIRD AT LIBERTY IT WILL NEITHER BE ABLE TO FEED ITSELF NOR OTHERWISE LIVE LONG ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING PERSECUTED BY THE WILD ONES THERE IS NO FOUNDATION HOWEVER FOR THIS NOTION AND I TAKE IT TO ARISE FROM AN EXCUSE FOR CONTINUING TO KEEP THESE BIRDS IN CONFINEMENT BUT290 BUT WE MAY NOT ONLY IMPROVE THE NOTES OF BIRDS BY A HAPPY MIXTURE OR INTRODCE THOSE WHICH WERE NEVER BEFORE HEARD IN GREATBRITAIN AS WE MAY ALSO IMPROVE THE INSTRUMENT WITH WHICH THE PASSAGES ARE EXECUTED IF FOR EXAMPLE ANY BIRDFANCIER IS PARTICULARLY FOND OF WHAT IS CALLED THE SONG OF THE CANARY BIRD WHICH HOWEVER MUST BE ADMITTED TO BE INFERIOR IN TONE TO THE LINNET IT WOULD ANSWER WELL TO ANY SUCH PERSON IF A NESTLING LINNET WAS BROUGHT UP UNDER A CANARY BIRD BECAUSE THE NOTES WOULD BE THE SAME BUT THE INSTRUMENT WHICH EXECUTES THEM WOULD BE IMPROVED WE LEARN ALSO FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT NOTHING IS TO BE EXPECTED FROM A NESTLING BROUGHT UP BY HAND IF HE DOES NOT RECEIVE THE PROPER INSTRUCTION FROM THE PARENT COCK MUCH TROUBLE AND SOME COST IS THERE FORE THROWN AWAY BY MANY PERSONS IN ENDEAVOUR ING TO REAR NESTLING NIGHTINGALES WHICH WHEN THEY ARE BROUGHT UP AND FED AT A VERY CONSIDERABLE EX PENCE HAVE NO SONG WHICH IS WORTH ATTENDING TO IF A WOODLARK OR SKYLARK WAS EDUCATED HOWEVER UNDER A NIGHTINGALE IT FOLLOWS THAT THIS CHARGE WHICH AMOUNTS TO A SHILLING PER WEEK  MIGHT BE IN A GREAT MEASURE SAVED AS WELL AS THE TROUBLE OF CHOPPING FRESH MEAT EVERY DAY A NIGHTINGALE AGAIN WHEN KEPT IN A CAGE DOES NOT LIVE OFTEN MORE THAN A YEAR OR TWO NOR DOES HE SING MORE THAN THREE OR FOUR MONTHS WHEREAS THE  OLINA SPEAKS OF A PASLE WHICH IS USED IN ITALY FOR NIGHTIN GALES BUT I CANNOT FIND THAT IT EVER ANSWERS WITH US PERHAPS THEY BRING THEIR NIGHTINGALES UP BY HAND AND SO ACCUSLOM THEM FROM THEIR EARLIEST INFANCY TO SUCH FOOD 2 SCHOLAR291 SCHOLAR PITCHED UPON MAY NOT ONLY BE MORE VIVACIOUS BUT WILL CONTINUE IN SONG NINE MONTHS OUT OF THE TWELVE I FEAR HOWEVER THAT I HAVE ALREADY DWELT TOO LONG UPON THESE VERY MINUTE AND TRIFLING ADVANTAGES WHICH MAY RESULT FROM MY EXPERIMENTS AND OBSER VATIONS I SHALL THEREFORE NO LONGER DEFER SUBSCRIBING MYSELF DEAR SIR YOUR

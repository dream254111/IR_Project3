slight squeak if accidentally hurt It appeared to be fully adult when caught but I have no other means of knowing how old it then was It now acts as if feeling the effects of age At first I tried feeding it grain seeds and green food It would eat no green food that I gave it and would not touch water For two years I have given it only dry barley or dry wheat and no water It seems to prefer the wheat It is a mystery to me how such an animal can live and thrive for years on dry grain without water or moisture in any form Once or twice a year I empty its box and put in fresh dry sand and set the box in an angle in the hall where it is perfectly dry I put nothing more in the box but dry grain and a little cotton to make a nest of yet under these con ditions it has lived three years Many birds and animals do not drink water or but rarely but most such eat either green food soft insects or freshlykilled flesh from all of which sources some moisture is obtained From where does my pocketmouse get its moisture Some seems necessary to make blood replace water evaporated from the lungs and skin and other waste F STEPHENS Santa Ysabel Cal Nov 22 Confusion in Weights and Measures THE interesting article in Science Nov 25 on weights and measures in England versus the decimal and metric system re ealls to my mind the difficulties I once experienced in stating the value in grains of a U S gallon of water at 60 F A telegram was handed me one morning requesting the above information and I requested the messenger to wait until I had written a re ply Much to my astonishment there existed the greatest con fusion among the authorities upon this simple point and it took me several months of investigation before I could write a satis factory answer to the above telegram Among the values noted were the following U S Pharmacopoeia 1870 583288862 grains it  1880 583496 Mfillers Chemistry 583173  Am Chemist Vol I p 318 583198  U S Dispensatory last edition 53328886  Oldbergs Weights and Measures 58335218  U S Treasury Department 83312 pounds The report on Weights and Measures by the Secretary of the Treasury Senate Doc 1857 says The gallon is a vessel containing 583722 grains 83389 pounds avoirdupois of the standard pound of distilled water at the temperature of maxi mum density of water the vessel being weighed in air in which the barometer is 30 inches at 62 F In view of all this confusion I thought it best to calculate a value for myself basing my work upon the weight of a cubic inch of water as given in Barnards Metric System My re sult was The U S gallon of distilled water at 60 F weighed in air at 60 F with barometer at 30 inches weighs 5833494640743 grains Referring to this result Dr Rice Chairman of the Committee of Revision of the U S Pharmacopoeia was good enough to say  Until further information is supplied the value reported de serves preference before all others It seems however highly desirable that this whole question of standards and relation of weight to measure be finally settled by law and preliminary to this by a new scientific investigation which might be most suit ably conducted under the auspices of the National Academy of Sciences or some other representative scientific body This U S gallon of which we have been speaking is as is generally known a survival of the old English wine gallon of 231 cubic inches which has become disused in England since the Im perial gallon was introduced in 1826 It is not generally known however that although dignified by an apparently  standard title the U S gallon has no statutory existence whatever In this lack of formal recognition the gallon does not stand alone for not one of our common weights and measures with the sin gle exception of the  Troy  pound has any place upon the na VOL XX No 516 tional statute books In 1873 an act was passed providing that For the purpose of securing a due conformity in weight of the coins of the United States the brass troypound weight procured by the Minister of the United States at London in the year 1827 for the use of the mint and now in the custody of the mint at Philadelphia shall be the standard troy pound of the mint of the United States conformably to which the coinage thereof shall be regulated Thus even the troy pound is seen to have no official recognition for general use but only for the special purposes of the mint It is curious in this connection to note that the metric system as a whole was legalized in this country by act of Congress of July 28 1866 The act reads It shall be lawful throughout the United States of America to employ the weights and meas ures of the metric system and no contract or dealing or plead ing in any court shall be deemed invalid or liable to objection because the weights or measures expressed or referred to therein are weights or measures of the metric system By act of Con gress the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to furnish each State with  one set of the standard weights and measures of the metric system It is true that an act passed June 14 1836 di rected a distribution to be made to the several States of complete sets of all the weights and measures adopted as standards reference being made to the weights and measures then and now in common use but it will be found upon inquiry that the expression adopted as standards refers to an action of the Treasury department made on the recommendation of Mr Hassler in 1832 and not to any action on the part of Congress To quote from the report of the Secretary of the Treasury for 1857 The actual standard of length of the United States is a brass scale of eightytwo inches in length prepared by Troughton of London and deposited in the Office of Weights and Measures The temperature at which this scale is standard is 62 F and the yardmeasure is between the 27th and 63d inches of the scale The gallon is a vesssel containing 583722 grains of the stand ard pound of distilled water at the temperature of maximum density of water the vessel being weighed in air in which the barometer is 30 inches at 62 F The standard of weight is the troy pound copied by Captain Kater in 1827 from the imperial troy pound The avoirdupois pound is derived from this its weight being greater than that of the troy pound in the proportion of 7000 to 5760 This troy pound was as has been said afterwards recognized by act of Congress thus becoming distinguished from the other socalled standards WILLIAM P MASON Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute Troy NY Dec 13 Is There a Sense of Direction  ON the first of May last my camping outfit started from Austin Texas bound for the northwestern part of the State They went through the country taking with them our camp dog Old Rock a common cur Professor Cope of Philadelphia and myself joined the party at Big Springs two hundred and fifty miles from Austin Our des tination was the upper Red River and the Staked Plains We travelled northward along the foot of the plains sometimes with out a road for about one hundred and fifty miles Thence we went west one hundred miles and thence south across the high plateau of the Staked Plains one hundred miles Thence we turned east crossing our former route at Clarendon continuing southeastward to Archer County a distance of one hundred miles We then went southwestward seventyfive miles and then back eastward to Archer and Montague Counties From there we turned southward to near Dallas where I disbanded my party and started my outfit back to Austin the last of October We had been in the field six months Old Rock had faithfully followed the wagon except at one time when his feet getting sore from travelling in the hot sand he had been hauled for a few days After the outfit started for Austin and when at

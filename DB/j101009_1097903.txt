MITTED TO AND DETERMINED BY THE COURT WITHOUT A JURY RESULTING IN A JUDGMENT AGAINST THE DEFENDANT TATE FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE TWO NOTES WITH INTERESTS AND COSTS TO WHICH JUDGMENT A WRIT OF ERROR WAS AWARD ED BY THIS COURT THE FIRST EXCEPTION TAKEN BY THE DEFENDANT IS TO THE REFUSAL OF THE COURT BELOW TO SUSTAIN THE OBJECTION OF THE DEFENDANT TO THE INTRODUC TION AND FURTHER EXAMINATION OF A WITNESS J G HAYTHE AFTER HE HAD BEEN EXAMINED CROSSEXAMINED AND TOLD TO STAND ASIDE AND AFTER HE HAD HELD A WHISPERED CONVERSATION OR CONSULTATION WITH PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL 28 MAYTATE V BANK OF NEW YORK THE PRACTICE HERE COMPLAINED OF IS NOT WITHOUT OBJECTION AND SHOULD NOT BE ENCOURAGED BUT AS WAS SAID BY THIS COURT IN THE CASE OF BURKE V SHAVER 93 VA 352 CITING BROOKS V WILSON 11 GRATT 411 AND LAND V MILLER 17 GRATT 187 THE SUBJECT OF THE EXAMINATION OF WIT NESSES LIES CHIEFLY IN THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT IN WHICH THE CASE IS TRIED AND ITS EXERCISE IS RARELY IF EVER TO BE CONTROLLED BY AN AP PELLATE COURT UNLESS IT IS PALPABLY IMPROPER TO GRANT LEAVE FOR THE SECOND EXAMINATION OF A WITNESS AN APPELLATE COURT WILL NOT FOR THIS CAUSE REVERSE THE DECREE OR JUDGMENT AS THE TRIAL COURT OUGHT TO POSSESS MUCH LATITUDE OF DISCRETION IN THE DECISION OF SUCH QUESTIONS THAT THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS PREJUDICED BY THE RECALL OF THE WIT NESS HAYTHE IS NOT MADE TO APPEAR AND THEREFORE WE CANNOT HOLD THAT IT WAS PALPABLY IMPROPER FOR THE COURT BELOW TO OVERRULE THE OBJECTION TO THE SECOND EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS THE NEXT CONTENTION OF THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR ARISING UNDER HIS SECOND BILL OF EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULING OF THE COURT BELOW IS THAT THE PROCEED INGS AND JUDGMENT IN THE SUIT OF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK OF NEW YORK AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AND OTHERS DISMISSED AT THE MARCH TERM 1897 OF THE CORPORATION COURT OF THE CITY OF LYNCYBURG AF FORDED AN ABSOLUTE AND CONCLUSIVE BAR TO ANY FURTHER RECOVERY AGAINST HIM UPON THE NOTES THEN IN SUIT FIRST BECAUSE THE ORDER DISMISSING THAT SUIT WAS A RETRAXIT BY THE PLAINTIFF OR IT WAS A FINAL AND COMPLETE AD JUDICATION BYTHE COURT OF THE MATTER IN CONTROVERSY VIZ THE TWO NOTES THE SUBJECT OF THIS SUIT AND THAT IN EITHER CASE THE CAUSE OF ACTION IS FOREVER EXTINGUISHED  AND FURTHER THAT PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS DIS CHARGED FROM LIABILITY UPON THE TWO NOTES IN QUESTION BECAUSE THE OBJECT AND EFFECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT ENTERED INTO AND CARRIED OUT BY AND BE TWEEN THE PLAINTIFF IN THE FIRST SUIT THIRD NATIONAL BANK OF NEW YORK AND THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG AND B E HUGHES THE MAKER OF THE NOTES WAS TO EXTEND TIME TO THE MAKER WHEREBY PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS DISCHARGED FROM FURTHER LIABILITY AS ENDORSER OF THE NOTES WAS THE ORDER DISMISSING THE FIRST SUIT A RETRAXIT OR A FINAL AND COM PLETE ADJUDICATION BY THE COURT OF THE MATTER IN CONTROVERSY  THE ORDER DISMISSING THE FIRST SUIT WAS NOT A RETRAXIT AND AS WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE WHEN WE COME TO CONSIDER THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE WAS NOT SO INTENDED BUT THE DISMISSAL WAS BY AGREEMENT BETWEEN THIRD NATIONAL BANK THE PLAINTIFF AND THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG A DEFENDANT KNOWN TO AND ACQUIESCED IN BY PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AND TO WHICH THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR THE BANK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WAS NOT A PARTY 1899 29VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER IF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK COULD HAVE MAINTAINED ITS SUIT AFTER IT HAD BEEN FULLY PAID THE BALANCE OF ITS DEBT TO SECURE WHICH IT HELD THE TWO NOTES THEN IN SUIT IT COULD ONLY HAVE BEEN MAINTAINED FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PARTY WHO WAS ENTITLED TO THE CALLATERAL NOTES AFTER IT THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK HAD BEEN PAID VIZ DEFENDANT IN ERROR THE BANK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR WAS NOT A PARTY TO THE FIRST SUIT HAD NO NO TICE OR KNOWLEDGE OF ITS PENDENCY AND FOR THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK AND THE DEFENDANTS TO ITS SUIT TO HAVE DISMISSED THE SUIT SO AS TO PRE CLUDE THE BANK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK DEFENDANT IN ERROR WOULD HAVE BEEN IN FRAUD OF THE RIGHTS OF THE LATTER A NOMINAL PLAINTIFF SUING FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS ASSIGNEE CANNOT BY A DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT UNDER A COLLUSIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE DE FENDANT CREATE A VALID BAR AGAINST ANY SUBSEQUENT SUIT FOR THE SAME CAUSE OF ACTION 7 ROB NEW PR P 9034 WELCH V MANDEVILLE 1 WHEAT 233 IN ORDER THAT A JUDGMENT MAY CONSTITUTE A BAR TO ANOTHER SUIT IT MUST BE RENDERED IN A PROCEEDING BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES OR THEIR PRIVIES AND THE POINT OF CONTROVERSY MUST BE THE SAME IN BOTH CASES AND MUST BE DETERMINED ON ITS MERITS IF THE FIRST SUIT WAS DISMISSED FOR DEFECT OF PLEADINGS OR PARTIES OR A MISCONCEPTION OF FORM OF PRO CEEDINGS OR WANT OF JURISDICTION OR WAS DISPOSED OF ON ANY GROUND WHICH DID NOT GO TO THE MERITS OF THE ACTION THE JUDGMENT RENDERED WILL PROVE NO BAR TO ANOTHER SUIT HUGHES V UNITED STATES 4 WALL 237 IN THE CASE BEFORE US THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR DOES NOT HOLD THE NOTES IN SUIT THROUGH THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK PLAINTIFF IN THE FIRST SUIT AND THEREFORE IS NOT A PRIVY IT HOLDS THROUGH THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG AND THE PRIOR ENDORSERS OF THE NOTES IN THE CASE OF COFFNAN C V RICHARDSON 4 MUN 207 IT WAS HELD THAT A DISMISSION OF A SUIT BY THE PLAINTIFFS ORDER IS NO BAR TO HIS BRINGING ANOTHER SUIT FOR THE SAME CAUSE OF ACTION EVEN THOUGH THERE WAS A JUDGMENT BY THE COURT FOR THE DEFENDANT AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR COSTS IN MUSE V FARMERS BANK 27 GRATT 257 THE COURT HELD THAT A DISMISSAL OF A CASE OR A DISCONTINUANCE IS NOT A RETRAXIT SAYING  BUT CLEARLY THE ORDER IN QUESTION WAS NOT A RETRAXIT AS THAT CAN ONLY BE ENTERED BY THE PLAINTIFF IN OPEN COURT AND IN DEALING WITH THE QUES TION OF DISCONTINUANCE SAYS THE JUDGMENT IN THE SAME CASE IS NO MORE THAN AN AGREEMENT NOT TO PROCEED FURTHER IN THAT SUIT AGAINST THE 30 MAYTATE V BANK OF NEW YORK PARTICULAR DEFENDANT SUCH JUDGMENT IS NOT A BAR TO ANY FUTURE ACTION AGAINST THE SAME PARTIES A RETRAXIT IS ALL OPEN AND VOLUNTARY RENUNCIATION BY THE PLAINTIFF IN OPEN COURT OF HIS SUIT AND THE CAUSE THEREOF THE USUAL AND PROPER ORDER WHERE THERE IS A RETRAXIT IS AS FOLLOWS THIS DAY CAME THE PLAINTIFF IN HIS PROPER PERSON AND HERE IN OPEN COURT ACKNOWLEDGES THAT HE CANNOT SUPPORT HIS ACTION AND VOLUNTARILY WITHDRAWS THE SAME AND RENOUNCES THE CAUSE THEREOF WHEREFORE ON MOTION OF THE DEFEND ANT BY HIS ATTORNEY IT IS CONSIDERED BY THE COURT THAT THE PLAINTIFF TAKE NOTHING BY HIS BILL BUT FOR HIS FALSE CLAMOR BE IN MERCY ETC AND THAT THE DEFENDANT GO THEREOF WITHOUT DAY AND RECOVER AGAINST THE PLAIN TIFF HIS COSTS BY HIM ABOUT HIS DEFENSE EXPENDED  ROB S FORMS P 96 IT DIFFERS FROM A NONSUIT SAYS THE COURT IN HOBVER V MITCHELL 25 GRATT 39091  IN THAT THE ONE THE LATTER IS NEGATIVE AND THE OTHER THE FORMER IS POSITIVE BUT SURELY IT CANNOT BE SAID THAT A DISMISSAL OF A SUIT BY A PLAINTIFF WHO NO LONGER HAS A RIGHT TO A JUDGMENT UPON THE CAUSE OF ACTION SUED ON BUT THIS RIGHT IS THEN IN ANOTHER WHO IS NOT A PARTY TO THE SUIT OR A PRIVY OF THE PLAINTIFF IS A RETRAXIT WHEREBY THE PARTY HAVING THE RIGHT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THE SUIT IS ABSOLUTELY AND FOREVER BARRED FROM BRINGING ANOTHER ACTION THEREON IT IS WELL SAID BY COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT IN ERROR IF THE JUDGMENT ON THE MOTION OF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK FIRST SUIT PRECLUDES ANY FURTHER RECOVERY ON THESE NOTES THEN THESE NOTES WHICH WERE DUE BE YOND QUESTION TO THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG BY ITS VICEPRESI DENT DIRECTOR AND MEMBER OF ITS FINANCE COMMITTEE B E HUGHES ITS COUNSEL J EMORY HUGHES AND J D TATEITS DIRECTORS AND MEMBERS OF ITS FINANCE COMMITTEEWOULD BE EXTINGUISHED WITHOUT PAY MENT TO THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG OR ITS ASSIGNEE MUCH THAT HAS BEEN SAID GOES TO ANSWER THE CONTENTION OF PLAINTIFF IN ERROR THAT HE WAS DISCHARGED FROM FURTHER LIABILITY UPON THE NOTES IN SUIT BECAUSE THE AGREEMENT BY WHICH THE FIRST SUIT WAS DISMISSED HAD THE EFIECT TO EXTEND TIME TO THE MAKER OF THE NOTES WHICH CONTENTION IS UPON THE GROUND THAT A JUDGMENT AT THAT TIME WOULD HAVE BEEN GOOD AGAINST THE MAKER OF THE NOTES WHEREBY THE ENDORSERS OF THE NOTES WOULD HAVE BEEN PROTECTED AS WE HAVE SEEN WHEN THE FIRST SUIT WAS DISMISSED THE PLAINTIFF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK HAD BEEN PAID THE DEBT DUE IT TO SECURE WHICH THE NOTES IN SUIT WERE HELD IN A COURT OF LAW A DEFENDANT CANNOT BE CHANGED TO A PLAINTIFF AND THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG THE LAST 1899 3132 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY ENDORSER ON THE NOTES COULD NOT BE MADE A PLAINTIFF THE BANK OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK COULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBSTITUTED AS PLAINTIFF EVEN IF IT HAD BEEN NOTIFIED OF THE SITUATION THEREFORE THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN A JUDGMENT UPON THE NOTES WHEN THE FIRST SUIT WAS DISMISSED MOREOVER IT IS ABUNDANTLY SHOWN THAT THE COURT BELOW WAS JUSTIFIED IN TAKING THE VIEW THAT AS PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS ANXIOUS TO AVOID A JUDG MENT AGAINST HIMSELF AND THE TRADERS BANK OF LYNCHBURG IN WHICH HE WAS A DIRECTOR AND MEMBER OF THE FINANCE COMMITTEE ALL THAT WAS DONE OR AGREED ON RESULTING IN A DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT WAS WITH HIS KNOWLEDGE AND ACQUIESCENCE HERE THEN WAS A SUIT TO WHICH ALL THE PARTIES TO THE NOTES WERE PARTIES DEFENDANT AND IN OPEN COURT THE SUIT WAS DISMISSED BY THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAD NO FURTHER INTEREST AND WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE MAKER AND ENDORSERS OF THE NOTES SUED ON UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES THE DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT COULD NOT BE RE GARDED AS A RETRAXIT OR AN ADJUDICATION BY THE COURT OF THE MATTER IN CONTROVERSY NOR WOULD IT FOR ONE MOMENT BE REGARDED AS A DISCHARGE OF THE ENDORSERS BECAUSE THE DISMISSAL EXTENDED TIME TO THE MAKER OF THE NOTES WE HAVE NOT DEEMED IT NECESSARY TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT A DISMISSAL OF A SUIT UPON A PROTESTED NOTE WILL CONSTITUTE A BAR TO ANY FUTURE ACTION AGAINST THE ENDORSER BECAUSE THE DISMISSAL OPERATES TO EXTEND TIME TO THE MAKER IF SUCH BE THE LAW AS TO WHICH WE NEED NOT EXPRESS AN OPINION IT HAS NO APPLICATION TO THE CASE AT BAR AND TO NO CASE IN WHICH THE DISMISSAL WAS BY A PLAINTIFF HAVING NO FURTHER INTEREST IN THE SUIT WITH THE APPROVAL OF THE ENDORSERS OF THE NOTE SUED ON UPON THE EVIDENCE IN THIS CASE VIEWED FROM ANY STANDPOINT BUT CERTAINLY WHEN VIEWED AS WE MUST UPON THIS WRIT OF ERROR AS UPON A DEMURRER TO EVIDENCE IT CLEARLY APPEARS THAT THE DISMISSAL OF THE SUIT OF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK WAS WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NOTES SUED ON WERE TO BE DELIVERED TO THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR THAT THIS UN DERSTANDING WAS CONCURRED IN BY THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR AND THAT HE RECOGNIZED THAT SUCH WAS THE AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AFTER THE NOTES HAD BEEN TURNED OVER TO DEFENDANT IN ERROR THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS PRESENT WHEN THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK OF NEW YORK TURNED THE NOTES OVER TO COUNSEL TO GET JUDGMENT THEREON IF THEY WERE NOT PAID AND THEN SAID THAT HE DID NOT WANT A JUGDMENT TO GO AGAINST HIM AND THAT THE MATTER WOULD BE SETTLED BEFORE THE COURT ADJOURNED THAT HE SEVERAL TIMES CAME TO THE OFFICE OF THE COUNSEL FOR THE PLAINTIFF IN THETATE V BANK OF NEW YORK FIRST SUIT TO SEE WHAT WAS BEING DONE ABOUT THE MATTER AND WAS IN FORMED OF THE SITUATION THAT IN FACT PLAINTIFF IN ERROR WAS FULLY ADVISED OF EVERYTHING BEING DONE AND OF THE RIGHTS OF DEFENDANT IN ERROR TO THE NOTES WHEN THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK WAS PAID THE DEBT FOR WHICH THE NOTES WERE HELD AS COLLATERAL AND ITS SUIT DISMISSED AND THAT HE MADE INQUIRY FROM TIME TO TIME DURING THE COURT AS TO HOW THE TRADERS BANK WAS GETTING ON PAYING THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK HE TESTIFIES IN HIS OWN BEHALF THAT HE THOUGHT B E HUGHES THE MAKER OF THE NOTES WAS PAYING THEM TO THE THIRD NATIONAL BANK AND THAT THE NOTES HAD BEEN PAID OFF UNTIL HE WAS INFORMED BY LETTER FROM COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT IN ERROR THAT THEY HELD THE NOTES FOR COLLECTION BUT ON CROSSEXAMINATION HE ADMITS THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SAID TO COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT IN ERROR THAT HE WOULD PAY THESE NOTES AND THAT THE SUIT HAD BEEN DELAYED DURING THE TERM OF THE COURT AT WHICH THE TRIAL WAS HAD IN ORDER FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ARRANGEMENTS TO DO SO THE POINT MADE BY PLAINTIFF IN ERROR THAT THERE APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN A MATERIAL ALTERATION IN EACH OF THE NOTES IN QUESTION IN THAT THE NOTES ARE WRITTEN ON PRINTED FORMS FOR NOTES PAYABLE AT THE NATIONAL EX CHANGE BANK WHILE IT APPEARS THAT THE PRINTED WORDS NATIONAL EXCHANGE HAVE BEEN ERASED IN EACH NOTE AND THE WORD TRADERS WRITTEN IN INK IN LIEU OF THE WORDS SO ERASED IS WITHOUT MERIT THERE WAS NO ISSUE MADE AS TO THE GENUINENESS OF THE NOTES BEFORE OR AT THE TRIAL ALTHOUGH PLAINTIFF IN ERROR HAD SEEN THE NOTES WHEN PLACED IN THE HANDS OF COUNSEL FOR SUIT IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND BESIDES ADMITS THAT HE HAD ALWAYS SAID TO COUNSEL FOR DEFENDANT IN ERROR THAT HE WOULD PAY THE NOTES AND THAT A TRIAL OF THE CASE WAS DELAYED IN ORDER TO GIVE HIM TIME TO ARRANGE TO DO SO WE ARE OF OPINION THAT THERE IS NO ERROR IN THE JUDGMENT COMPLAINED OF AND THEREFORE IT IS AFFIRMED AFFIRMED DISMISSED AGREED HAD THE ORDER IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE BEEN SIMPLY DISMISSED AGREED IT MIGHT HAVE PRESENTED A MORE SERIOUS QUESTION THAN THAT CONSIDERED BY THE COURT IN HOOVER V MITCHELL 25 GRATT 387 THE ORDER ENTERED IN THE FIRST SUIT WAS ON MOTION IT IS ORDERED THAT THIS SUIT BE DISMISSED AGREED THIS ORDER WAS PLEADED IN BAR OF A SECOND SUIT FOR THE SAME CAUSE OF ACTION JUDGE ANDERSON SPEAKING FOR THE COURT SAYS THIS BEING NEITHER A NONSUIT NOR A DISCONTINUANCE WHAT IS IT IT IS AN OPEN VOLUNTARY RENUNCIATION OF HIS SUIT IN COURT IT HAVING BEEN DONE UPON THE CONSIDERATION THAT THE SUIT HAD BEEN AGREED BETWEEN HIM AND THE DEFENDANT DOES NOT MAKE IT LESS A RETRAXIT BUT FILRNISHES RATHER AN ADDITIONAL REASON FOR THE CONSEQUENCE OF A RETRAXIT TOWIT THAT THE PLAINTIFF BY IT FOREVER LOSES HIS ACTION THE ORDER ENTERED BY THE COURT HOWEVER IN THE CASE CITED DOES NOT GO 1899 3334 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY AS FAR AS THE OPINION IT DECLARES  THAT THE DISMISSION OF A SUIT AGREED WITHOUT ANY EXPLANATION OR QUALIFICATION SHOWING A CONTRARY INTENTION IS AT LEAST A PRIMA FAEIE DETERMINATION OF THE MATTERS CONTROVERTED IN THAT SUIT AND MAY BE PLEADED IN BAR OF A SUBSEQUENT SUIT THIS SEEMS TO BE A CLEAR ADMISSION THAT THE REAL AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES MAY BE SHOWN AND THAT THE PLAINTIFF WILL NOT BE BARRED OF HIS SECOND SUIT UNLESS IT HAD BEEN SO AGREED THIS VIEW SEEMS TO BE S RENGTHENED BY WHAT IS SAID IN SIRON V RULEMAN 32 GRATT ON P 223 THERE THE ORDER IN THE FIRST SUIT WAS  THIS SUIT IS DISMISSED AGREED THE COURT SAYS  THERE IS NOTH ING TO SHOW THE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT BEYOND WHAT THE ORDER IMPORTS IT AT LEAST IMPLIES AN ADJUSTMENT OF SOME SORT BUT THE CAUSE WAS REMANDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENQUIRING INTO THE NATURE EXTENT AND EFFECT OF ANY ADJUSTMENT OF RIGHTS WHICH MAY HAVE BEEN ENTERED INTO BETWEEN THE EXECUTOR AND THE DEVISEES AND LEGATEES IN WOHLFORD V COMPTON 79 VA 333 IT IS STRONGLY INSISTED THAT DISMISSED AGREED IS A RETRAXIT BUT JUDGE LACY IN THE COURSE OF THE OPINION OF THE COURT DELIVERED BY HIM SAYS  IN THIS CASE WE ARE NOT LEFT TO CONJECTURE AS TO WHAT THE NATURE OF THE AGREEMENT WAS IT IS ADMITTED TO BE UPON THE PAYMENT OF THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS BY THE DEFENDANT TO THE PLAINTIFF IN FULL SATISFACTION OF THE CLAIM OF THE PLAINTIFF AND IS AS BINDING ON HIM AS IF THE DECREE HAD BEEN FOR THE PAYMENT OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT CLAIMED AND IT HAD BEEN PAID BY THE DEFENDANT IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT A PLEA OF PAYMENT WAS ALL THAT WAS NEEDED THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAS ADOPTED A DIFFERENT RULE IT IS THERE HELD THAT THE WORDS DISMISSED AGREED ENTERED AS THE JUDGMENT OF A COURT DO NOT OF THEMSELVES IMPORT AN AGREEMENT TO TERMINATE THE CONTROVERSY NOR IMPLY AN INTENTION TO MERGE THE CAUSE OF ACTION IN THE JUDGMENT IT IS FURTHER HELD THAT IF THE AGREEMENT UNDER WHICH THE SUIT WAS DISMISSED SETTLED OR RELEASED THE MATTER IN CONTROVERSY THAT FACT MUST BE SHOWN

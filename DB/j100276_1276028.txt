j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276028,The English Judicature Act of 1873,i254483,THIE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 IT seems to be the general impression that reform in judicial procedure is a new and radical thing in the history of juris prudence This is far from the fact It is as old as juris prudence itself From Solon to Justinian from Justinian to the Magna Charta from the Magna Charta to Bentham from Bentham to Field and in every civilized country radical changes have taken place from time tol time touching both procedure and substantive law Court systems have been codified systematized and rearranged to meet advancing and changing social and industrial conditions From the religious ceremonies constituting the methods of legal procedure of the early Romans tol the wager of battle and of law in early English times from these and other primitive methods to the intricate formalism of the thirteenth to the early part of the nine teenth centuries and from that period until the present constant changes have taken place As we look back through the centuries and follow the struggles of men for liberty according to law we can see clearly that these changes have had in the main a strong if not a controlling influ ence toward the fulfillment of that desire The trouble with most of us when we consider this subject of reform is that we do not look at it from the proper historical perspective When the perfect system of procedure is found and the book of Experience closed I apprehend that the period of social decadence will be entered upon It was so in Rome and other oncegreat na tions and may be so with us It is to be noted that in the great crises of the past and whenever any considerable change has been accomplished in the law such re forms have been brought about by a minority of the lawyers sup ported by laymen It is but natural that this should be so In early manhood lawyers are taught the fundamental principles of both sub stantive law and of procedure in the necessary preparation for the work of their profession To them these principles have a significance that has no parallel in any other study they may undertake They become wedded to them and they become a part of their habitual thought and conduct As they engage in their work from day to day they are concerned only in what is and not in what might be Their plans are formed upon conditions that exist upon principles that have long been established upon precedents on which they can safely rely and without speculation follow These conditions these considerations make the lawyer the most conservative of men ItMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW is well that this conservatism exists for it is one of the strong counteracting forces of civilization holding in check those extreme proposals for reform advanced from time to time which if given full effect might lead to disaster During the early formative period of English jurisprudence con stituting the beginning of our common law repeated but unsuc cessful efforts were made to incorporate the methods of the civil or Roman law into our procedure Bracton who wrote in the thir teenth century was one of the later writers who made this attempt But the judges of that early period sought to establish a distinct system of laws which should be especially adapted to the English people and resisted strenuously all efforts at interference with that purpose It was this resistance that developed our jury system and through the jury system our rules of evidence and methods of trial wherein we differ materially from the methods of Roman procedure even to this day Any one who will take the trouble to enquire into the methods of procedure as now applied by the continental coun tries of Europe will note the wide divergence between that system and our own Such investigation will also be illuminating in this it will indicate the origin of many of our modern day reforms which have either wholly or partially failed because of the utter incon gruity of the two systems Our early system of equity courts and jurisdiction and particu larly the practice in those courts was in large measure an early adaptation of Roman or civil remedies and procedure by a common law country The conflict of jurisdiction between courts of law and of equity and the different methods of taking proof and of hearing have continued through the centuries and not until quite recently in many common law jurisdictions have these distinctions been either modified or entirely abated Where equity courts are still maintained as has been the practice through the years the chancel lor or judge takes all the evidence offered as would be done under the Roman procedure but contrary to that practice applies the common law rules olf evidence and eliminates all incompetent irrel evant and immaterial matters from consideration in reaching his conclusion These matters have all been worked out and thoroughly discussed in the masterworks of Sir Matthew Hale Pollock  Maitland Sir Henry Maine and others who devoted in large part the energies of their lives to the study of the history and philosophical develop ment of our common law 278THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 But it was not until Benthams time the latter part of the eighteenth and the fore part of the nineteenth centuries that the real significance of the distinction between substantive law and proce dure or adjective law was brought out with clear and proper em phasis Blackstone and all the writers before him did not make the distinction as it has been understood since Benthams day These early writers and judges treated the form and ceremony by which substantive rights were established as of equal importance to the right itself The form the kind of writ the rule the absolute letter it was contended must be complied with The one was as much law as the other I apprehend however that at this day we can all agree with Pro fessor Holland when he says We have a law of persons a sub stantive law which explains the rights of those persons and an adjective law which describes the procedure by which redress is to be obtained when those rights are violated And again So far as it defines thereby creating it is substantive law So far as it pro vides a method of aiding and protecting it is adjective law or pro cedurel This distinction first clearly voiced by Bentham was undoubtedly one of his chief contributions to the cause of later procedural re forms in this country and in England for it forms the underlying basis of all subsequent efforts in that direction and is the principle upon which all accomplished reforms are established But Bentham did not live to see his ideals or any of them either accepted or accomplished His lifes work seemed to be fruitless of any results except the fugitive effort of Edward Livingston of Louisiana one of his disciples who framed a new code of procedure for that State in 1805 Livingston later in I820 at the request of the Louisiana legislature accomplished a complete codification of the law both civil and criminal on lines mapped out by Bentham but it failed of adoption It became however the groundwork for much of the codification of many of our States forty to fifty years later and even influenced the work of the various commissions of England appointed from time to time between 1832 and I869 whose united work culminated in the Judicature Act of I873 But the conserva tism of the bench and bar of England denied recognition to Ben thams genius during his life time and his chief work was brought out in France through the efforts of friends there It will not be necessary nor will space permit me to go into much if any detail concerning the various matters relating to com 1 Holland Elements of Jurisprudence 78 348 279MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW mon law pleading and practice It will be presumed that my readers are all more or less familiar with this subject Michigan is still a common law State socalled and although many of the niceties technicalities and formalities of the early com mon law procedure have been either modified or entirely done away with by statute and otherwise we still adhere in the main to that practice A glance over the tables of contents of our practice books both law and chancery will show that in the former we still adhere to many of the forms of action and writs of an earlier period and irn the latter that the methods of a century or more ago in large meas ure still obtain The distinction between law and equity is still up held The fictions that had their origin in the early stages of com mon law development are many of them still retained although they have long since lost their meaning and purpose Until changed by recent rule we adhered to the lost and finding idea in trover and conversion and still adhere to implied promise in assumpsit and to certain feigned situations in ejectment all of which arose out of a desire on the part of the early judges tol establish certain substantive rights for which there wias no convenient formula within the scope of some existing formula Who of us realize when we write at the close of our declarations And therefore he brings suit that or iginally six or seven hundred years ago the suit referred to was not the action about to be commenced but the suite or train of suitors a plaintiff was required to bring personally into court to vouch for the good faith of his cause and in a measure to awe the defendant into submission The larger the train and the more influ ential the suite the more likely was the plaintiff to win his case Such a meaning has become entirely lost to us but wve still use the form with a different meaning The distinction between personal and real actions is still main tained Under the head of personal actions we still find assump sit trover case trespass and replevin Under case there are the various actions for damages covering negligence fraud malicious prosecution false imprisonment and the like The real actions are ejectment summary proceedings to recover possession of lands trespass on lands nuisance waste and foreclosure of mortgage by advertisement Special statutory legal remedies are provided for which are contempt mandamus procedendo quo warranto habeas corpus scire facias proceedings against fraudulent debtors proving execution of deed discharge of mortgage of record and vacating village plats There are also special statutory proceedings against infants corporations certain municipal bodies executors and admin 280THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 istrators and sheriffs as well as proceedings to enforce liens and to recover penalties and forfeitures On the equity side of the court the various grounds for relief and subjects of jurisdiction are almost illimitable and I will not attempt to mention them simply saying in passing that relief in such courts is granted outside and beyond the jurisdiction of a court of law for no court of equity is permitted to grant relief when there is an adequate remedy at law The volumes of our reports are full of cases where the suitor has mistaken his remedy and has in consequence been denied relief The misjoinder of causes of action and the hardandfast rules in relation thereto find exemplification in many of our adjudicated cases The rules as to both parties plaintiff and defendant in actions at law and complainants and defendants in suits in chancery show that we still adhere in the main to the rules of several centuries ago One has only to look through the work of Dicey on Parties to Actions or any similar work on procedure and practice to find verification of this statement An examination of the prevailing forms either at law or in equity will show in many instances the needless prolixity of the pleadings still required Yet we are prone to believe and we hear the sentiment generally expressed that Michigan differs from the other States that she needs no reform in her legal procedure that her procedure already has been so simplified by statute that further simplification would be not only unnecessary but useless This again is the natural expression of conservatism We have become accustomed to our own procedure and are inclined to believe that while other States may need reform in this regard we do not The assumption still obtains it is true that we all understand these rules of pleading and as lawyers can apply them with accu racy and precision in establishing the substantive rights of our clients But is this assumption well founded We have only to look through our digests on any subject relating to pleading and practice to find that it is not that innumerable cases are reversed on account of defects in these particulars Litigants are often carried from one court to the other on the wings of procedure to find at last that instead of kicking the goal they have lost out completely because of some defective practice early in the game and are thereupon set back or penalized to the point of be ginning I recall with what interest and avidity I pored over Stephen on Pleading some thirty years ago It seemed to me thenand I still 28IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW cherish the same feelingthat nowhere had I encountered so pro found so logical and so clear an exposition of a single branch of the law as contained in that volume Personally therefore I do not object to the systemi and with Judge EVANS of the Supreme Court of Alabama can say While as a citizen and a judge I de plore it yet as a lawyer and dialectician I rejoice in it As a means for the administration of justice its efficacy is to be doubted while as an intellectual gymnasiuml its appointments could scarcely be improved upon 2 The first edition of Stephen on Pleading was published in I824 Its close technical rules and formalisms constituted the practice of all Englishspeaking peoples at that time except in the State of Louisiana where the first Livingston Code had been adopted in 1805 as already stated Bentham had radically attacked the conservative though con summate and profound exposition of the law by Blackstone whose pupil he had been from at least three standpoints I As to the distinction which should be drawn between adjective and substan tive law 2 the futility and waste of having two separate and distinct systems of jurisprudence law and equity to administer substantive rights to a single people and 3 the needless prolixity of all existing pleadings in proceedings at both law and in equity For many years Bentham was practically alone But his vigorous attacks finally set men to thinking Sir Henry MAINE who wrote in I874 said I do not know of a single law reform effected since Benthams day which cannot be traced to his influence Beginning with 1828 the English Parliament appointed a series of commissions to enquire into law procedure and other subjects and report such changes as should be enacted Bentham died in I831 It was in that year that the first commission so appointed made its report The opinion was expressed by this commission that the existing rules of common law pleading were founded in strong sense and closest logic and so appear when well understood and explained It was believed by this commission that these rules could be adapted to the demands of modern times without impairing their integrity and that any attempts to establish a new system would cause greater mischief than the retention of the old The possible fusion of the administration of courts of law and equity was scarcely deemed a practical question at this time It was still be lieved that the idea of the administration of legal and equitable 2 7I Cent L Jour 3279 282THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF I873 rights by distinct tribunals was founded upon the principles of eternal justice It was not until thirty years later that this question became a real live issue The conservatism of the report of this first com mission led of course to a no less conservative result The so called Hilary rules of court and some partial changes in chancery practice followed These rules framed by the judges under authority granted by Parliament but hardly touched the vital questions of reform then being agitated Their chief aim was to remedy what were essential but incidental defects and faults of the existing system the vague ness of general pleading the prolixity of special pleading and the necessity of certain formal allegations They were an effort it is said to stave off an immediate pressing difficulty by a patchwork scheme of modification and suspension and operated to delay pro cedural reform at least twenty years But as stated by Sir Fred erick Pollock the flood tide of 1832 had not yet ebbed In letters in science in trade and industry there was on all hands a conscious ness of fresh vigor and an expectation of great results As it must needs fall out mens expectation was in some things beyond the mark in some wide of it in many far short of it3 It was not howTever until the enactment of the New York Code of I848 that the English legislators were again aroused to action The radical and extensive aims of this Code going far beyond the boldest designs of the English reformers had a profound effect Its practical workings were carefully watched and its comparative suc cess stimulated them to new efforts Their movements however were more cautious than ours had been In New York the pre vailing system had been annihilated by a single blow by a single act and an entirely new and different system established in its place comprising so far as possible many of the principal measures of reform advocated by Bentham and his followers England felt its way slowly The enactment of their leading reformatory statutes continued through a period of twenty years from 1852 to 1872 and in the end went even farther than any American code has ever goneunless it be the recent New Jersey Code passed in July 19I2 The first distinct change was marked by a series of statutes relating to both the law courts and the court of chancery The first series known as the common law procedure acts established a reform system of pleading at law and extended 33 Law Quart Rev 344 1887 283MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW through a period of enactment of eight years4 The second series established a reform system of equity pleading and covered a period of ten years5 The first act of the first series contained 236 sections and two schedules of forms Two years later it was followed by an amending and enlarging statute of Ioo sections and six years later by another known as the Common Law Procedure Act of I86o These statutes were not of sudden or ephemeral growth but were based upon reports of distinguished law commissioners led by no less profound lawyers and scholars than Lords Denman and Broug ham They were destined however to be shortlived but they marked a great advance in the direction of reform It was pro vided among other things that causes of action of whatever kind may be joined in the same suit provided they be by and against the same party Forms of action were simplified and many fictions formerly required to be set forth in pleadings were abolished Spe cial demurrers were also abolished But more significant than all the rest many equitable defenses were permitted in actions at law This act was largely followed by many of our American States particularly Iowa in establishing their several codes of procedure But it fell far short of accomplishing the ultimate aim of the re formers in at least two particulars The principle that a pleading whatever the nature of the relief sought should be a plain and con cise statement of the material facts had not yet been established It was still possible to sacrifice substance to form Nor had the wall which separated legal from equitable procedure been shaken mater ially Some inroads had been made however and the general drift was clearly in the direction of ultimate fusion The second series of acts relating to the court of chancery be gan also in 1852 In that year two acts were passed one to amend the practice and proceeding and the other for the relief of suitors in that court These were followed by another act in 1858 and four years later by the Chancery Regulation Act of I862 By the Chancery Act of 1852 witnesses could be orally examined before the court itself By the act of I858 damages might be awarded in certain instances and a jury miight be called to assess such damages or to try questions of fact On such trials the chan cellor was given the powers of a judge sitting at nisi prius The Act of I862 went still farther and provided that the court of chan cery should try out every question of law and fact incident to the 4 15  I6 Vict c 76 17  i8 Vict c 125 23  24 Vict C 126 5  i6 Vict c 86 and 87 2i  22 Vict C 26 25  26 Vict C 42 284THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF I873 relief sought The court was permitted also if more convenient to transfer to the assizes the trial of questions of fact by a jury It is thus seen that these statutes also bore heavily against the barriers that still separated legal and equitable procedure and relief For nearly twenty years both these common law and equity acts flourished but finally under the leadership of Lords Cairns and Selbourne and many others of the English bench and bar the fusion between law and equity was accomplished and the entire pro cedure of England placed upon a uniform basis by the Judicature Act of I873 By this act the entire system of common law pleading was swept away It was followed in 1875 by an amendatory and supplemental act and both went into operation November I I875 For nearly forty years it has been the sole guide of the English practitioner Various amendatory acts have been passed from time to time but these have all been in furtherance of the purposes of the original act and not in antagonism thereto During this period of forty years it has been adopted by all the independent colonies of Great Britain In 1879 Connecticut adopted it so far as practica ble and it has been in satisfactory operation there ever since As already stated in July I912 the Legislature of New Jersey passed a new practice act incorporating all the fundamental principles of the English Judicature Act The various codes of the several States beginning with the New York code of 1848 and there are now about twentyseven so called code States have much in common with the English judica ture act The chief aim of this act was to create and maintain a uniform law of procedure for all of the superior courts of England This aim involved the general and fundamental principle that the whole controversy should be settled according to the substantive rights of the parties completely in one proceeding by short and direct steps To accomplish this aim it was provided I That the great historical courts of the realm that had grown up through the centuries having different and conflicting powers and jurisdiction should be consolidated into one supreme court of judicature This was in effect but bringing together in modern form the original and ancient kings court There were two per manent divisions of this consolidated court the high court of jus tice and the court of appeals For convenience the former was divided into several divisions but each division had all the powers of the others The appellate division possessed all the jurisdiction of the other divisions and for the purpose of finally determining the substantive rights of the parties on appeal the unusual right was given to this division to admit in its discretion new evidence orally 285MICHIGAN LAW REVIEWI or by deposition to the end that the controversy may be finally set tled This discretion it is said has been very seldom exercised Nevertheless upon the theory of the act that no judgment should be set aside or new trial granted for any technical error or for any error in the admission or rejection ouf evidence but only in the interest of justice we can see that where evidence has been im properly excluded at the trial it does not become a very far reach for the appellate tribunal to supply such omission in order to enable it to pass finally upon the merits Under this procedure no civil case can fail or be much delayed for want of power in the court to decide it completely In the provision requiring the court to administer all legal and equitable remedies in one and the same action the English act avoided the mistake of the American codes wherein the latter at tempted to abolish the distinction between actions at law and suits in equity but continued the old and distinctive methods of trial and remedies such as injunction and specific performance This has led to much hostile construction and criticism which was avoided by the provisions of the English act This act brought about an immediate unification of all the sub stantive law and every division of the court was required by a sin gle method of procedure to administer all the remedies that any party might have whether at law or in equity in every cause action or dispute properly before it Where there was any conflict between the rules of equity and the rules of the common law the rules of equity should prevail All old forms and distinct actions were abol ished A statement of claim was substituted for the declaration and bill in equity a defense for plea and answer and a reply for the replication The pleadings ended here except by leave of court 2 It was further provided that the courts themselves should make their own rules of procedure in amplification of and to carry out the spirit and intent of the act This provision is significant Parliament it is true reserved a veto power as to any rules so to be adopted and this was believed to be a sufficient check upon the pos sible usurpation of power by the courts The act itself contains only about one hundred sections while the rules of the court number from twelve to thirteen hundred The practice act of Connecticut has only thirtyfour sections and the rules of court number three hundred and twentysix The New Jer sey Act has only thirtyfour sections It is assumed by this provision of the act relative to rules that the courts from their special training and knowledge in the admin 286THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 istration of justice are better qualified than a legislative body to pre scribe such rules of procedure as will be conducive to a speedy hear ing and determination of causes brought before them In this regard the judicature act differs from all the various American codes This difference is vital It has led to the failure of many of those codes to carry out the purposes originally intended and has been the one thing above all others that has resulted not only in the apparent but the substantial success of the English Act Here in our socalled code States the various legislatures under con stitutional authority have prescribed not only the powers and juris diction of the courts but their practice and procedure as well This has led to a constant increase from year to year of procedural pro visions many of which are antagonistic to the purposes of the initial act many with only a local or temporary application and many to meet some pending or anticipated legal action The result has been that the New York code has grown from four hundred sections in the beginning to the ponderous compass of four thousand sections True the courts here in both code and common law States may and do under authority granted prescribe rules for their own guidance and that of practitioners but a single act of the legislature may nullify any one or more of them In our own State a common law State our Supreme Court is authorized to prescribe rules governing the conduct of our courts and we have a somewhat elaborate sys tem so made But an act of the legislature may abrogate the rule in whole or in part or require a new rule to interpret or supplement the act itself This is illustrated by Chancery Rule 37 supplementing the chancery appeals act of this State of I9o7 A system which permits two jurisdictions one legislative and the other judicial to prescribe rules of court procedure necessarily leads more or less to confusion to uncertainty to apparent antagonism and creates prolixity of practice and prevents uniformity of decis ions In our own State we have only to examine the statutes re lating to the procedure in attachment garnishment and many other statutory proceedings for a verification of the conclusion here stated and a demonstration of the superiority of the English method over our own 3 The English rules are designated as Orders with various subdivisions each order however covering the rules relating to a single topic I will briefly summarize the scope of these Orders or such of them as have a bearing upon our own practice with such brief com ment as may seem pertinent 287MICHIGAN LAW REVIEIW Order I supplements the general purpose of the judicature act to unify the procedure by providing for a single form of action When we compare this methold with our own with its numerous forms of action and of defense at both law and in equity we are led to ask why so many and what sufficient reason aside from their historical character can be advanced in their suppolrt If the vari ous provisions of our own statutes regulating the practice and pro cedure in our courts of record were eliminated I apprehend that their bulk would be reduced very materially Under the English system every step in the cause is under the discretionary control of the court A slip therefore in procedure will neither defeat nor delay the action Orders 64 and 70 prolvide in substance that the court or any judge shall have power to enlarge olr abridge the time appointed by any rule for doing any act upon such terms as justice may require and this although the application therefor be not made until after the expiration of the time appointed or allowed Noncompliance with any rule of practice shall not render any proceeding void un less the judge shall so direct but such proceeding may be set aside in whole or in part or amended or otherwise dealt with in such manner and upon such terms as the judge shall direct No applica tion to set aside any proceeding for irregularity shall be allowed unless made within a reasonable time nor if the party applying has taken any fresh step after knowledge of such irregularity These provisions are significant and most conspicuous Their enlargement of the discretionary power of the common law court cannot be doubted It is however in harmony with the general trend of statutory enactments in both England and this country for the past seventyfive years beginning in the former country with the Hilary rules of I832 Our own statute of amendments and its predecessors illustrate the increasing authority given to the courts in this regard When it is thoroughly understood that adjective laws and adjec tive rights are only incidental to substantive rights and that the lat ter are more likely to be aided and protected by the tribunals espec ially prepared and empowered to administer them the unrestricted discretionary power of these tribunals to direct their own procedure will not be seriously doubted Both the federal and State consti tutions in this country provide certain safeguards to personal liberty and to property rights Under these provisions the jurisdiction of the several courts is defined Neither property rights nor liberty can be taken without due process of law and the right of trial by jury is preserved All courts must proceed within these constitu 288THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 tional limitations They must have jurisdiction over the subject matter parties nmst have a reasonable legal notice with an oppor tunity to be heard and judgment must be confined to the issues pre sented These limitations are fundamental to the rights and liberty of every citizen They are substantive rights Legislatures are equally bound to respect them The question is as to whether this discretion in the matter of procedure only shall be exercised by legislative or by judicial authority alone or by both It seems to me on principle that inasmuch as these constitutional rights must be observed by the courts the means and methods of such observance or the procedure must necessarily come within the exclusive discretionary control of the courts alone and not jointly with any other body Under our present practice as we all know our procedure is fixed by rules or by statute or by both The court is bound by them and either party may invoke these rules or statutes to hinder or defeat the pending action Our statute of amendments touches but feebly and inadequately the outer hem of the garment of procedural difficulties It must not be assumed however that questions of practice do not frequently arise in the English courts They do buit they rarely defeat the pending action save only in cases of lack of jurisdiction or of such neglect as to constitute a forfeiture of a right to be heard on the merits Orders I6 I8 and 19 relate to the joinder of parties in causes of action and to counterclaims Order I6 provides in substance that all persons may be joined in one action as plaintiffs in whom any right arising out of the same transaction or transactions exists whether jointly severally or in the alternative On application however if it is deemed expedient the court may order separate trials without amendment If the cause is commenced in the name of the wrong plaintiff the court may order the right person sub stituted or added upon such terms as may be just The rule as to parties defendant is equally as broad Any one interested in whole or in part or in the alternative may be joined and the judgment will be joint or several according to the respective rights or liabilities of the parties Trustees executors and admin istrators are permitted to sue or be sued in their representative capacity without bringing in the parties beneficially interested who however may be brought in on the order of the court Where sev eral parties are interested in the same way in a cause the court may authorize one to prosecute or defend in behalf of all the others No cause shall be defeated by reason of nonjoinder or misjoinder of the parties These may be either struck out or added on the courts 289MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW own motion at any stage of the proceedings Persons so added shall be duly summoned Whenever contribution is claimed from a third party such party may be brought in on leave of court and due notice Order I8 relates to joinder of causes of action Several causes whatever may be their nature may be united in the same action but if the court deems it more convenient to try them separately he may so order Some limitations are placed upon this right as in actions to recover land only questions growing out of the detention can be joined also actions by trustees in bankruptcy cannot without leave of court be joined with an individual claim of such trustee On the other hand claims by or against husband and wife may be joined with claims by or against either of them and personal claims by or against executors or administrators when sued as such may also be joined whenever they arise with reference to the estate Order 19 relates to defendants counterclaim Such defense may be made which arises out of the same or a different transaction in tort or contract subject to the same limitations of convenience of trial as before stated It also provides that the opposite party may demand particulars or a more definite pleading on short notice De fective statements are either amended or struck out immediately Any abuse of the rights given under these orders is checked by the power of the court to correct such abuse and award commen surate costs The principle that the action shall proceed by short and direct steps is carefully safeguarded There are no fictions Order 2 provides that the summons shall command the defendant to enter his appearance within a stated time and warn him that on his default judgment will be entered against him The summons must be endorsed with a statement of the true nature of the claim and the true amount claimed when known The pleadings must contain only a concise statement of the actual substantive facts not the evidence to be proved Facts cannot be pleaded according to legal effect Proofs are confined to the statements in the pleadings Under Orders 19 and 28 the court has unlimited power to grant amendments Every step is a short and direct step to a given end A defendant may be called upon on the application of a plaintiff to satisfy the court at once that his defense is not a sham If it is suspicious terms may be imposed or the defendant forced to imme diate trial Order I4 Order 25 provides that there shall be no demurrers Points of 290THE ENGLISH JUDICATURE ACT OF 1873 291 law are to be raised in the answer and disposed of either on motion or at a trial The jury is usually required to find the disputed facts special questions being submitted to them in writing for that purpose Judg ment is entered for the party entitled thereto by the trial judge upon such findings This practice naturally lessens the grounds for grant ing new trials Compare it with our own where new trials are fre quently granted on grounds which have no relation to the facts By the English method the court of review is enabled in the proper case to reverse the judgment and enter judgment for the party en titled thereto without a new trial Order 40 provides for motions for judgment which are always made in the appellate court on the findings of facts by either court or jury in the court below Order 58 provides for appeals All appeals are in the nature of a rehearing Procedure by bills of exception do not exist Notice of appeal is given which states the points of appeal As already stated the appellate court may take additional proof for the purpose of determining the substantive rights of the parties and judgment is entered such as should have been entered in the court below Points of procedure are settled summarily Questions on which final judgment depends must be raised at the first opportunity or they are waived On such questions an appeal may be taken imme diately and has preference in the appellate court over appeals from final judgments Orders 50 and 53 provide that orders or judgments of the court shall be used in place of injunctions and writs of mandamus There are many other provisions but enough have been referred to to fairly determine the general purpose and scope as well as the general merits of the English procedure That it has been successful is unquestioned for it still receives the support of the leading members of both bench and bar of Eng land and such of her colonies as have adopted it Cases reversed on points of procedure or without due regard to the merits are rare if not unknown The leading principles of this 4ct were adopted by Connecticut in I879 as I have stated and no member of the bench or bar of that State has been heard to say so far as I am aware that that State should abandon it or go back to the old methods of pro cedure This should be a sufficient demonstration that at least the under lying principles olf the act can be adapted to American conditionsMICHIG4AN LAW REVIEW and life The successful application of the principles of the act to the procedure of the Municipal Court olf Chicago is significant The new Equity Rules of the Federal Court also follow closely the language of the rules of the English Judges framed under the Judicature Act That the system still has its opponents is also true both in this country and in England This is evidenced by a recent article and the conclusions the writer reaches6 These conclusions however are wide of the mark for nothing suggested in the article indicates that England proposes to change the fundamental principles of her pro cedure but only to provide for certain incidental matters as must necessarily arise from time to time in a great growing country con cerning so vital a subject That the system is not yet perfect and probably never will be must be conceded Nor is it probable that a perfect system can ever be devised But in my judgment there are many principles of the English procedure which with proper limitations as to their appli cation we may adopt in our own practice to our advantage We may come to this subject of procedural reform to scoff but as the full light of a century of purposeful effort is throlwn upon us we remain to pray WILLIS B PERKINS GRAND RAPIDS 75 Cent L Jour 402 292

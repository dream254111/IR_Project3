CLASSES On the 25th and 26th of April the first conference of the  Central Bureau for the encouragement of institutions which tend to increase the material wellbeing of the laboring classes  took place at Berlin This Central Bureau Centralstellefiir Arbeiterwohlfahrtseinrichtungen is the result of long en deavors on the part of the men foremost in the move ment of social reform in Germany to create a common centre of action and thus correlate the efforts of those wishing to better the ondition of the laborers in their employ besides aiding employers in every way pecuniary aid excepted in the planning and execution of such pro jects The main stress is to be laid upon the erection of workingmens houses Plans and advice based upon the experience of the past are placed at the disposal of all employers Some months ago ten different associations whose common platform is the amelioration of the condition of the laboring classes founded the Central Bureau the first conference of which was called for the 25th and 26th of April with these eleven other associations joined their efforts as well as a number of the great industrial establishments of Germany such as those of Krupp Stumm and others The Govern ment has shown its interest in this movement by cooperat ing with the executive organ of the Central Bureau in the appointment of two of its members The opening clauses of the Constitution of this body define as exactly as possible the objects of the organization I The collection exposition and cataloguing of descrip tions and reports of institutions for the amelioration of the condition of the laboring classes74 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY II To give all necessary information and to answer all questions of associated as well as of nonassociated societies concerning such institutions III To send accounts of the noteworthy endeavors in this domain of social reform to the organs of the associated societies as well as to other reviews and journals The first day of the conference was devoted to the tene menthouse question Inasmuch as the time was very limited the papers which were to be read were published in extenso before the conference took place These were as follows i The control and care of the employer for the dwellings of his laborers by Herr Kalle Wiesbaden 2 Cooperation of the employer in the solution of the tenementhouse question by Dr Albrecht Lichterfelde 3 General principles in the erection and furnishing of workingmens dwellings by Dr Nussbaum of the Technical High School of Hanover 4 Encouragement of the settlement of laborers in the State mines through the granting of building advances and building premiums by Chief Councillor of Mines Taeglichs beck 5 The workingmens colony at the State torpedo factory at Friedrichsort by Captain Harms 6 The workingmens colony at the State car workshops at Leinhausen by Railway Director Thiele In view of the fact that the Congress was already in possession of the printed articles these gentlemen limited themselves to a few general remarks in which they gave a synopsis of their paper supplementing it with some explanatory facts In an introduction Mr Kalle passes in review the many advantages which an employer derives from the comfortable housing of his laborers He then examines the different methods through which the employer can exert an influence upon the erection of workingmens houses The system employed by the Prussian Mining Administration which is aCONFERENCE OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU 75 system of noninterest bearing loans and building premiums was first considered We shall have occasion to speak of this system more in detail Then came the system employed by Messrs Billroy  Boch in Mettlach Upper Silesia which consists in build ing houses out of the firms funds and then enabling the workingmen to become proprietors through the gradual pay ment of the cost of the same The employee is expected to pay at least 5 per cent of the cost of the house and lot annually of which 3 per cent represents the interest upon the capital invested and 2 per cent the amortization The house remains the property of the firm during the first ten years of such payments after which the workingman may take the property into his own hands upon the condition of continuing the payment of the 5 per cent until the amortiza tion is complete This experiment has been crowned with great success and has served as a model in many parts of Germany The most common system was then examinedthat of building the houses by the employer from whom the laborers rent By far the most extraordinary effort in this line has been made by the firm Friedrich Krupp Working men and their families included 73769 personsare de pendent upon this gigantic undertaking Of these 24193 are tenants of houses built by the company The majority of these houses contain six dwellings or apartments The rents are as follows  Dwelling with two rooms and cellar 90lo8 marks Dwelling with three rooms and cellar 120o62 marks Dwelling with four rooms and cellar 18o200 marks Dwelling with five rooms and cellar 216330 marks annually The rent is deducted from the wages every two weeks Other wellknown efforts in this direction were then discussed as well as the questions of leases of gene ral eating houses and kitchens for the unmarried laborers76 ANNALS OF THEu AMERICAN ACADEMY The second paper that of Dr Albrecht upon The cooperation of the employer in the solution of the tenement house question limits itself mainly to that part of the ques tion which is peculiar to great centres of population The building associations are examined in detail especially the English  Terminable Societies  and the Philadelphia Building and Loan Associations the French  SocidtM immobiliere des ouvriers de Paris and the Scandinavian  Arbeydernes Byggeforening The few efforts made in Germany with such associations are then taken up especially the Berlin Cooperative Building Society which was founded in 1886 with twentyeight mem bers as a nucleus Each member is bound to take stock to the amount of 200 marks fifty dollars which can be paid off in weekly dues of forty pfennige ten cents No mem ber can be the holder of more than ten shares Upon the money paid in a dividend is declared if the piofits are high enough to warrant this A shareholder can become proprie tor of one of the houses built by the society in one of two ways He may on the one hand pay onethird of the price immediately the remainder being placed in the form of a first mortgage upon which he has to pay the interest In this case he passes into immediate possession Should he not however have the necessary sum he can lease the house at the rate of 6 per cent of the price Of the 6 per cent 4 per cent is regarded as rent and 2 per cent as amor tization of the cost of the house As soon as onethird is paid off in this manner the tenant takes possession of the house as proprietor the remaining twothirds of the price being covered by a first mortgage This society has rapidly developed since 1886 so that it includes today 800 share holders who have already paid 1in 95000 marks Over sixty houses have been built in different parts of Berlin with a total value of 730000 marks These houses however can only be rented by the very highestpaid laborers so that the question is by no means solved Dr Albrecht sees the solution however even for the lower class of laborers inCONFERENCUE OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU 77 the cooperative principle but maintains that the employer should come to their aid by putting his business capacity at their disposal in the administration of such cooperative societies and by granting or procuring credit for the society until the first houses are finished With an appeal to the State as well as to the community to do all in their power to further these efforts the report closes The paper of Dr Nussbaum upon the General Principles to be followed in the erection and furnishing of workingmens dwellings is technical in its nature He examines into the circumstances which should determine the selection of build ing lots the principles of proper drainage and sewerage the choice of building material the plan of such houses the necessary size of an apartment their heating airing and cleansing This paper limits itself almost exclusively to the tenement or flat  system The paper of Chief Councillor of Mines Taeglichsbeck was one of the most interesting of those presented He showed what the State Mining Administration had done to improve the condition of the dwellings of its laborers The results obtained show a most admirable activity in this line In the State mines in Upper Silesia the administration presents the miner with a building lot to which is added a nonin terest bearing loan which may reach the sum of 240oomarks He is then bound by the contract to inhabit the house him self for a period of at least ten years Taking all the State mines of Prussia we find that from 1865 to the close of the fiscal years I89091 the administration of mines in order to encourage the permanent settlement of their laborers in the neighborhood of the mines granted 3471815 marks in building premiums and 6050545 marks in noninterest bear ing loans A paper by Captain Harms contained an account of the efforts of the State Torpedo Factory to care for the material welfare of its laborers The factory employs 825 workmen  The miner is of course no longer bound by the contract if he leaves the mine In this case the house is repurchased by the Administration78 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY It encountered especially great difficulties in the solution of the dwelling problem because of the comparatively great number of unmarried laborers which it employs The sys tem adopted was to build houses with two and four apart ments for families to which were attached single rooms for the unmarried element Railway Director Thiele contributed a paper containing a description of the houses built by the Prussian Administra tion of Railroads for the employees in the workshops of Lein hausen near Hanover In the discussion which followed delegates from all parts of Prussia took part Especially interesting were the remarks of Herr Gussmann one of the directors of the Krupp works He sketched as briefly as possible the almost unparalleled efforts of this company to win for itself a trustworthy thrifty and honest army of laborers through a systematic amelioration of their material and mental condition Another very interesting question touched upon was the position of the funds of the State Insurance Association for the aged and incapacitated This is particularly important for Berlin which according to the imperial law forms a district by itself It seemed to be the general opinion that a liberal interpretation of the law would allow onethird of the funds to be invested in such a way as to encourage and promote arrangements for the amelioration of the condition of the laboring classes such for example as the taking of mortages upon workingmens houses the buying of land for the erection of such houses etc As a complement to these papers the Central Bureau had prepared a very complete exposition of models and plans of working mens houses as well as different institutions intended for the mental culture or physical recreation of the laboring classes of which a few words will be said presently The second day of the conference was devoted to the ques tion of the judicious use of Sunday and the other free hours of the laborer The first paper upon the programme was that of Professor B6hmert of Dresden upon the question ofCONFERENCE OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU 79 Recreation of the Workingman Outside of the Home His remarks which were a commentary upon the printed article already in the hands of the members present com menced with a reference to the new Prussian Sunday Labor Law limiting the hours of labor This limitation he would wish to see further extended To him the labor ques tion is more of an educational than a stomach problem That the best recreation and recuperation is to be found in the bosom of the family is not to be denied but unfortun ately so many laborers lack a real home that one must en deavor to find for him recreation outside of the family Furthermore it should be the object of benevolent men not so much to increase the opportunities for amusements as above all to ennoble those already at the disposal of the laborer The speaker then proceeded to give an account of the results of an inquiry made by himself into this question by means of questionsheets sent to fiftyone large industrial establishments The opinions given were widely divergent In his conclusions Professor B6hmert lays special weight upon the independence of the laborer in his recreations and the advisability of the employer taking part in them as much as possible He furthermore advocates fgles in which politics and religion play no part whatever At the close of his address Professor Bohmert expresses the hope that the exposition of the plans and models of social arrangements will remain a permanent one and that an association of employ ers will be founded to do everything in their power to further the interests of their laborers The second speaker of the day was Herr Hitze deputy to the Landtag and Reichstag He limited himself to the question of the recreation of the laborer in the family His main argument was for the ma terial and moral purification of family life as the highest object of every social reform Several reforms are advo cated for which however the conditions sine qua non are a healthful dwelling a thrifty housewife the proper care and education of the children Herr Zander treated  Recreation Outside of the Family80 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY One of the main objects of popular amusement he claimed to consist in a diminution of the contrasts between the dif ferent classes of society through cooperation of the better situated Deputy v Schenckendorff dealt with  Popu lar Games Herr M Eners with  Popular Amusements Pastor Kanzow describes the efforts made by the famous Bolle Dairy in Berlin to provide for the recreation of their em ployees During the course of the proceedings of the second day the Minister of the Interior v Berlepsch defined the position of the Central Bureau as it was regarded by the Government The Prussian Ministry said he looks upon the Central Bureau as a purely private institution but adds that had not private initiative called it into existence the government would undoubtedly have taken this step In no sphere of social reform is private initiative so healthful and efficient as just here as a State institution it would have remained noth ing more than a statistical bureau As a union of different associations however it can become an important factor in social reform That two delegates of the government are members of the executive organ of the Central Bureau is ex plained by the fact that the State is the greatest employer in Germany In the evening an excursion was made by the members of the conference to Bolles Dairy where an entertainment very popular in its nature had been arranged so as to give the visitors an idea of the success which this philanthropic employer has obtained in the education and recreation of his 300 employees and their families Before closing our description of the conference we wish to add a few words concerning the exposition of devices for the promotion of the welfare of the working classes which was arranged in the building where the conference took place The greater part of the exposition was devoted to plans and models of workingmens houses The interesting part of this experiment is that the collection will probably form the nucleus of a permanent exposition This is all theCONFERENCE OF THE CENTRAL BUREAU 81 more important for Prussia since the State itself is a great industrial employer The exposition will be a means of bringing before the public the efforts made by the different administrators to ameliorate the condition of their respective laborers In this way a very healthful influence can be exerted upon the industrial world especially upon German employers Of very great interest are the exhibits of the Navy Department the Department of Public Works and the Department of War Models of dwellings of amuse ment halls of gardens etc show how much has been done by the Prussian State for laborers under its immediate charge The plans and models exhibited by Krupp of Essen also deserve special mention The Central Bureau for the Promotion of Institutions for the Welfare of the Working Classes has commenced the publica tion of a  Correspondence which appears the 15th of each month as the organ of the Bureau It contains descrip tions of experiments and results in this field of work This institution is only one of the symptoms of the extra ordinary activity of the State as well as of certain circles of employers in the study of the social problems and the at tempts to solve some of them If all the expectations of its founders are realized the Central Bureau will undoubtedly become a centre around which all those earnestly interested in social work and reform will group themselves LEo S RowE Berlin May 1892THE ORIGIN AND GROWTH OF TAXATION IN JAPAN The history of taxation in Japan can be traced as far back as two or three centuries before Christ Like all primitive peoples the Japanese lived in earlier ages by hunting and fishing without regular government but with the intro duction of agriculture came the payment 6f a kind of tax Nearly all the people being farmers and believing that all of the land was a possession of the Mikado they were accus tomed to offer him yearly a certain part of their products This voluntary contribution becoming in time customary and then compulsory was the origin of taxation in Japan Soon after the land tax the labor tax came into existence under which the people were compelled to labor a certain time each year in making canals roads and drains for agricultural purposes In the first part of the third century A D when Mikado Nintoku ascended the throne the people were growing poor and wretched from the effects of the very heavy land and labor taxes which had been levied by the pre ceding Mikados He ordered therefore that the people should be exempt from the land and the labor taxes for the period of three years hoping by this means to place them in a prosperous condition Ancient historians praise this act as one of the ablest of his reign Mikado Kotoku in 646 A D first laid the foundation of systematic taxation Until this time it can hardly be said that a regular system of taxation existed The rice fields were accurately measured and their productiveness esti mated It was found that on the average a cho 2Y2 acres would produce 2500 sho t of rice and accordingly I io sho  In spite of its brevity this sketch will suggest to the student of European insti tutions many significant analogies between the Feudal system as it developed in Japan and in Western EuropeTHE EDITORS t A measure either dry or liquid equal to ten  go or 109375 cu in about I qt I pt 3 oz I dr of imperial measureORIGIN AND GROWTH OF TAXATION IN JAPAN 83 was fixed as the amount that should be collected as a tax Two tans the fifth of a cho were assigned to each male and twothirds of the same to each female and an actual enumeration was to be taken every sixth year Ten days labor tax was annually imposed upon every person between the ages of sixteen and sixty This tax might be commuted by a payment of twenty feet of linen two feet being thought equivalent to one days labor Be sides this a tax of ten feet of silk twenty feet of pongee or forty feet of linen according to the productivity of the soil was paid for every cho of rice land Moreover a house tax was imposed in the reign of Mikado Kotoku When the medium of exchange consisted of grain silk or linen a tax of twelve feet of linen for example was paid for every house Soon after this period commercial communication sprang up between China and Japan and grew rapidly bringing Chinese civilization into Japan Chinese ideas influenced law literature religion and industry and no doubt the Japanese government adopted Chinese ideas in their system of taxation The rice fields which belonged to private owners were divided into nine equal parts and the product of the middle part was paid to the government as a land tax the remainder going to the owner This was called the Seiden system and was borrowed from the Chinese without much modification It is said that in 723 A D ample rice fields were created by draining lands through recourse to the labor tax and that although the rate of land tax was then fixed at five per cent of the product this rate was often reduced during civil wars famines and floods One historian says that there is an instance in which the land tax was even suspended for ten years However after a few years government officials began to oppress the people by exacting as heavy a tax as the people could bear At an earlier time it was customary to donate land to the church but this custom was abolished in the eighth century84 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY in order to increase national taxation for church property was exempt from taxation A custom of donating lands to colleges and universities in order to avoid taxes also existed as such lands were of course free from taxes From an early time the Mikados government was accus tomed also to give uncultivated lands to court nobles which lands were not subject to taxation In these ways nearly all of the rich and fertile land came into the possession of feudal clans or churches under the name of Soen As a conse quence the Mikados government could not obtain sufficient revenue and at last became much embarrassed thereby To remedy these evils in IS06 Shogun Yoritomo appointed a representative from each of the sixtysix provinces and also selected one chief in each Soen to collect taxes and arrest conspirators and robbers At first he supported the army by collecting an extra tax of five sho per tan but this was too heavy a tax for his people to bear and the scheme was soon abandoned The Hojo family succeeded to the Shogunate government of the Yoritomo family They modified the system of land tax to some extent and authorized the transfer and sale of all land except the governments possessions In the first decade of the fifteenth century the Ashikaga family succeeded the Hojo in the Shogunate government At the beginning of the reign a land tax of two per cent was levied which was soon raised to five per cent It will be remembered that Hojo and Ashikaga were de facto sover eigns and that the Mikados were de jure sovereigns since the founding of the Shogunate government by Yoritomo The middle period of the Ashikaga reign witnessed bloody civil wars The tax imposed by the government in creased year by year until finally it is said that it became so oppressive that farmers deserted their cultivated lands and left them to become waste territory In addition to this tax expensive and luxurious works were undertaken and heavy loans were exacted from the wealthier merchants This compulsory levy it is said was made twelve times aORIGIN AND GROWTH OF TAXATION IN JAPAN 85 year or even eight or nine times a month in emergencies During this time the most wonderful proclamations of which we have ever heard were issued By these proclama tions all debtors were made free from their obligations and mortgaged lands were returned to their original owners with out compensation This was thought to be the means by which the rich and poor could be equalized Soon after Toiko took control of the Shogunate govern ment in the first decade of the sixteenth century he sent un necessary filibustering expeditions against Corea He built Osaka Castle the largest and most extensive work of its kind in Japan but being unable to find the means to defray these heavy expenditures he modified the system of land tax to meet his wants He diminished the tan from 360 to 300 ho while he exacted the same amount of tax from the new tan as from the old In a word he increased the land tax by onesixth It is said that during his reign the land tax amounted to 60 or 70 per cent of its product It must have been the heaviest tax imposed on any peasantry in the world During the three hundred years of the peaceful era of the Tokugawa line of the Shogunate government the taxes were generally lightened but a feudal system was in full force and extensive feudal estates were owned by the feudal nobility called Daimios These Daimios were scattered throughout Japan and each was supreme within his own limits Each could even issue an unlimited amount of paper currency and cause it to circulate within his king dom and perform other like acts which are strictly sover eign rerogatives Thus the time and manner of payment and the amount to be paid differed astonishingly in the different territories Even in the immediate territories of the Shogunate the system of taxation was not uniform Besides the land included within the territory of each of the Daimios there were lands belonging to the im perial family lands held by the Shogun lands in posses sion of the Hatamoto a small feudal aristocracy forming a86 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY distinct class created by the Tokugama Shoguns and hold ing petty fiefs from them lands in possession of the Shinto and Buddhist religious establishments and lands received by individuals from the government in return for meritorious ser vice The above distinctions existed in the ownership of land and occupants might hold land therefore from a territorial noble from the Mikado from the Shogun government from a Hatamoto from a Shinto or a Buddhist establishment or from any large proprietor who was a grantee of land from the government It may be inferred from a Consideration of this state of things that the people who occupied the lands were simply tenants but while they were tenants in fact they were landlords in name each in respect to his par ticular piece of land Very extensive proprietary rights though falling short of complete ownership were enjoyed by different classes and were distinguished as lands in the town and lands in the country The holdings were again distinguished with reference to the kind of title as  i Holdings occupied by the military class which were ex empt from taxation and held no title deeds 2 Town land as it was called which meant land held by merchants and citizens who paid taxes and held title deeds The country holdings comprised nearly all the land under cultivation occupied by the large class of agriculturists who were on the same footing with merchants and citizens with re gard to taxes and title deeds There was indeed a numerous class of smaller agriculturists who were in no sense of the word proprietors but who were tillers of land rented from a higher class of farmers or from the real owners The land occupied by the military class was held under the peculiar conditions attaching to military service then ex isting in Japan and the position of these agriculturists dif fered in some respects from that of the taxpaying class who occupied town holdings But the proprietary rights in eachORIGIN AND GROWTH OF TAXATION IN JAPAN 87 case were much the same Holdings descended from father to son in accordance with the law of primogeniture the effects of which were sensibly modified by the law of adoption peculiar to the country In case of failure of direct heirs the right of subletting subject to the approval of the real owner was acknowledged and fully exercised Fixity of tenure was virtually assured But though the tenant was practically free from disturbance in his possession and had a tenure good as against all other people he possessed only a modified tenure as against the real owner The latter reserved to himself the rightthough it is believed to have been seldom exercisedof reentering upon the land at will In such cases of disturbance the occupant received some sort of compensation usually in the grant of other land in the vicinity generally that of an inferior quality There were other restrictions The agriculturalist could not combine the profession of merchant with that of farmer Farmers merchants and citizens were alike pre cluded from entering into any transaction in regard to land occupied by the military class and a reciprocal prohibition between the military and industrial classes is due no doubt to the fact that land assigned to the military class was exempt from taxation while land held by the other classes was not It is clear therefore that the holders of land in Japan during the Tokugawa Shogunate possessed very extensive proprietary rights in regard to their holdings limited by the restrictions abovementioned But it must be remembered that under the feudal system the occupants of land belong ing to the territorial nobility were virtually at the mercy of their landlords In 1868 the Shogun was defeated after a short war and the Mikado came into power He was now the de facto as well as the de jure head of the Japanese government The four great Daimios who were most prominent and influ ential in bringing about the revolution and most powerful in supporting the cause of the Mikado proved themselves fully equal to the occasion and when the abolition of the office of88 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Shogun was declared these four Daimios united in surren dering all of their territorial and feudal privileges to the Mikado All powers both civil and military which the Mikado had lost since the twelfth century returned again to his hands The doctrine was established that the title to all of the land embraced within the Empire of Japan was vested in the Mikado and it was admitted that he had been ille gally divested of it An important act published in March 1868 rendered liable to taxation all land held in grant from the government and in the autumn of the same year the restrictions that have been mentioned as to business transactions between certain classes were removed In 1871 every restriction was cleared away Other regulations followed in rapid succes sion each successively being further removed from the prin ciples of feudalism against which they were aimed each also being pervaded by equity and justice Among the most important laws promulgated at this time was one requiring the government to compensate individuals for land whenever taken from them for public purposes and fixing the rate of compensation according to the value en tered in the title deed By the beginning of the year 1872 the government had so legislated that the position of all holding land was clearly defined and there existed no longer any doubt as to the extent of the privileges enjoyed by those in possession of land In 1873 the great reform of the landtax commenced and at the same time more than a thousand kinds of miscellan eous taxes were abolished which had been levied during the feudal period From this time the whole people have been brought under a uniform law of taxation TAKEKUMA OKADA 7okio Japan

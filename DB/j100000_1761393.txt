j100000,Science,1761393,The Cholera Bacillus,i300380,454 SCIE MR R A PROCTOR attempts to explain how earthquakes are caused in the June number of Harpers magazine and attributes their energy to the action of interior heat on percolating water and their opportunity to the time of changing pressures caused by atmos pheric or tidal loading and unloading of the sensitive crust of the earth Formidable num bers represent the tons of air or water brought on or taken off certain parts of the earths surface in the passage of cyclones and anti cyclones and in the rise and fall of tides but it may be strongly questioned whether these changes of pressure are very effective in deter mining the time of earthquake snaps for the changes are gradual and shortlived the press ures are relatively light and the surfaces on which they have effect are so broad that the extremely small deformation needed for ad justment of equilibrium might be produced without any cracking or snapping The omis sion of clear reference to orogenic earthquakes in such an article is very unfortunate for Mr Proctor will have many readers who take him for an authority on such matters and in the present attitude of seismology the orogenic theory is certainly strongly supported by those who give the study the closest attention It is rather remarkable to find no reference to grav itative distortions of the earths crust except in explaining the heat of the interior after Mallets method and no mention of earth Iquakes following the making of cracks that are freely assumed as the passages by which water enters the subterranean regions there to be exploded into steam LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Correspondents are requested to be as brief as possible The writers name is in all cases required as proof of good fa ith Real and imaginary Americanisms Is the verbatim report of Sir William Thomsons famous Baltimore lectures occurs the expression and that is why I cannot get the electromiagnietic theory To this Mr George Forbes in his com mentary in Nature for April 30 appends a footnote These reports are generally quite verbatim but I am sure Sir William Thomson is not responsible for this characteristic Americanism Is it not rat her a Scotticism It is no Americanism at all Although N CE VOL V No 122 an American of long standing and considerable ob servation in such matters I never heard get by itself used in the sense of  comprehend or  under stand To get hold of is a not uncommon collo quial form But in the same paragraph Mr Forbes passes unnoticed a real and most prevalent Ameri canism I do not think I would like to suggest etc And again at the close of the lectures  I would be most happy to look forward to another conference This substitution of would  for shoul  we should charge to the reporter and feel sure that he was born west of New England and New York where the just distinction between  will and  shall  would and should is innate while it is lost farther west and south But the confusion is reaching England as some recent books and newspapers show I do not believe that Sir William Thomson has caught the prevalent epidemic much as he has been in the affected districts A G The cholera bacillus The exact role of the comma bacillus  in the eti ology of cholera Asiatica remains sunsettled Argu ments for and against the conclusions of Koch are perhaps equally strong on both sides as evidenced by the discussions in the conferences on cholera held in Berlin Munich and London Inoculation which completes the chain of evidence required to make good

introduced a new method of operation with out the production of any external lesion and he reports the cases as completely confirming the view of the pathogenic nature of the bacillus Klein and Gibbs have denied the existence of the cholera bacil lus in the intestinal tissue On the other hand since Kochs original proof they have been demonlstrated by Babes and confirmed by Crookshank by staining

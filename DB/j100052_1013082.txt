SHORE OF THIS GULF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT PURPOSES TO ESTAB LISH A NAVAL BASE THE ISLANDS WITHIN THE GULF OF FONSECA BELONG TO SALVADOR AND THAT OF MEANGUERA COMMANDS THE ENTRANCE TO THE GULF THE PRESIDENT OF THE REPUBLIC IS ANXIOUS TO SEE ESTABLISHED ON THIS ISLAND A FREE PORT SIMILAR TO THAT ON THE ISLAND OF CURAGAO OFF THE COAST OF VENEZUELA HIS IDEA IS THAT IF WAREHOUSES DRY DOCKS AND COALING STATIONS FOR SHIPS WERE ERECTED ON THIS ISLAND THE MERCHANTS OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES COULD SHIP THEIR GOODS IN BULK TO THIS PORT WHERE THEY WOULD BE ENTERED FREE OF DUTY BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT WHOLESALE STOCKS COULD BE CARRIED IN THIS CENTRAL PLACE AND THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES SUPPLIED FROM THAT POINT IN ASMUCH AS THREE OF THE REPUBLICS BORDER ON THE GULF OF FONSECA THE TRANSSHIPMENT OF GOODS IN SMALL QUANTITIES TO THE RESPECTIVE COUNTRIES COULD EASILY BE ACCOMPLISHED A CONCESSION FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF SUCH A PORT WAS GRANTED BY THE NATIONAL ASEMBLY IN THE YEAR 1914 THE OPPORTUNITY IS OPEN TO AMERICAN MERCHANTS TO CAPTURE THE ENTIRE PACIFIC TRADE OF CENTRAL AMERICA BY ESTABLISHING THEM SELVES AT THIS TIME IN SALVADOR THE COUNTRY HAS BEEN SINGULARLY FREE FROM REVOLUTIONS THE LAST OUTBREAK OF THIS NATURE HAVING OCCURRED AS FAR BACK AS 1895 THE REPUBLIC HAS A STABLE GOVERN MENT WHICH CHANGES EVERY FOUR YEARS BY THE BALLOT INSTEAD OF THE BULLET THE PEOPLE ARE INDUSTRIOUS AND THE CLIMATE IS SALUBRIOUS THERE IS AN ENTIRE ABSENCE OF THE FEVERS PECULIAR TO THE COUNTRIES IN THE LATITUDE OF SALVADOR ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE THIS IS CHIEFLY BECAUSE THE COUNTRY IS HILLY AND WELL DRAINED ALSO ON ACCOUNT OF AN ABSENCE OF LOWLYING MARSHY LANDS TO CONCLUDE SALVADOR IS WELL WORTHY OF A VISIT AND THE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION OF AMERICAN CAPITALISTS WHO MAY BE CONTEMPLATING INVESTING IN LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES GUATEMALA BY JOHN CLAUSEN MANAGER FOREIGN DEPARTMENT THE CROCKER NATIONAL BANK OF SAN FRANCISCO THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA SITUATED EAST OF MEXICO COVERS AN AREA OF ABOUT 50000 SQUARE MILES WITH AN ESTIMATED POPULATION OF 2120000 INHABITANTSTHE LARGEST OF ANY CENTRAL AMERICAN COUNTRYOF WHICH 125000 RESIDE IN THE CAPITAL GUATEMALA CITY THE NAME GUATEMALA IS PROBABLY OF AZTEC ORIGIN AND IS SAID TO MEAN LAND OF THE EAGLE THE BULK OF ITS PEOPLE ARE LOCATED IN THAT HALF OF THE REPUBLIC BORDERING ON THE PACIFIC WITH FEW SETTLE 181THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MENTS ON THE NORTH OR ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE ITS MOUNTAIN RANGES WITH VERY LITTLE EXCEPTION GIVE THE COUNTRY AN ELEVATION OF FROM 4000 TO 11500 FEET THE PACIFIC SLOPE IS VERY FERTILE AND PRODUCES LARGE CROPS OF COFFEE CORN AND SUGAR WHILE ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE THERE IS FOUND VERY LITTLE AGRICULTURAL WEALTH EXCEPT FROM THE CULTIVATION OF BANANAS IN THE LOWLANDS AND NEAR THE COAST THE PRODUCTION OF COFFEE HOWEVER IS THE PRINCIPAL MONEY CROP OF THE COUNTRYMOVED LARGELY UPON FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN ADVANCED FOR THAT PURPOSEAND TO ITS MARKETING THEREFORE DEPENDS MUCH OF THE PROSPERITY OF THE REPUBLIC ACCORDING TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF FINANCE OF THE GOVERNMENT OF GUATEMALA MADE UNDER DATE OF APRIL 14 1915 ITS DEBT AMOUNTED TO 1330475979 UNITED STATES GOLD MADE UP AS BELOW ENGLISH DEBT  1178531439 INTERNAL DEBT  151944540 THEIR EXTERNAL OBLIGATION CONSISTS OF WHAT IS CALLED THE ENGLISH DEBT OF 4 PER CENT WHICH WAS NOT CONTRACTED BY THE PRESENT ADMIN ISTRATION BUT DATES BACK FROM THE TIME WHEN ALL CENTRAL AMERICA WAS ONE FEDERATION OF REPUBLICS OR IN OTHER WORDS SINCE THE INDE PENDENCE OF GUATEMALA WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE YEAR 1821 UPON THE BREAKING UP OF THE FEDERATION THREEFOURTHS 3 OF THIS OBLIGATION FELL TO GUATEMALA WHILE THE REMAINDER BUT ONE FOURTH 4 WAS ALLOTTED TO THE OTHER FOUR REPUBLICS SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIONS INCREASED THE DEBT BY ADDITIONAL LOANS AND DE LINQUENT INTEREST UNTIL IT REACHED THE AFOREMENTIONED FIGURE NO NEW FOREIGN LOANS HAVE BEEN CONTRACTED BY THE PRESENT GOVERNMENT ALTHOUGH IT IS LEARNED THAT NEGOTIATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN OPENED TOWARDS THE PLACING OF AN ADDITIONAL 3000000 UNITED STATES GOLD FOR MUNICIPAL IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CITY OF GUATEMALA ONLY DURING THE LAST FEW YEARS HAS GUATEMALA EFFECTED A MA TERIAL SETTLEMENT WITH ITS ENGLISH CREDITORS IN RESUMING PAYMENT OF INTEREST THE SERVICES OF THE ENGLISH DEBT REQUIRE ONLY 300 000 UNITED STATES GOLD ANNUALLY FOR INTEREST WHICH ARE CONVENIENTLY CARED FOR AS THE REPUBLIC HAS A FAVORABLE TRADE BALANCE OF APPROXI MATELY 3500000 UNITED STATES GOLD AND A NET INTERNAL REVENUE OF 1000000 TO 2000000 UNITED STATES GOLD IN NAMING THESE FIGURES HOWEVER IT MUST NECESSARILY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THAT THE EUROPEAN WAR TOGETHER WITH PREVAILING INADEQUATE TRANS PORTATION FACILITIES WILL TEND TO DECREASE THE GOVERNMENT REVENUES AS ALSO CUSTOMS TAXES WHICH AS HAS BEEN STATED REPRESENTS THE LARGER PORTION OF THEIR INCOME THE INTERNAL INDEBTEDNESS HAS BEEN FOUND DIFFICULT TO LIQUIDATE WITH THE RESULT OF CONSTANTLY INCREASING THE OBLIGATION BY DELINQUENT INTEREST PAYMENTS THE ENGLISH LOAN HOWEVER IN SPITE OF THE EXPENDITURE OF LARGE SUMS ON PUBLIC WORKS AND CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS OF THE COUNTRY HAS 182NEEDS FOR CAPITAL IN LATIN AMERICA RECEIVED ITS INTEREST IN ADVANCE AND THIS FEATURE IS BEING VERY FAVOR ABLY COMMENTED UPON BY BRITISH CAPITALISTS THESE BONDS HAVE BEEN QUOTED DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE YEAR AT 40 TO 41 NETTING THE HOLDERS NEARLY 10 PER CENT PER ANNUM UNLIKE MANY OTHER LATIN AMERICAN REPUBLICS THE MUNICIPALITIES OF GUATEMALA HAVE NO BONDED INDEBTEDNESS AND THEIR TEMPORARY ADVANCES FROM LOCAL BANKS ARE AUTOMATICALLY REPAID FROM TAXATION AUTHORITIES AFFIRM THAT IT WOULD TAKE APPROXIMATELY 12000 000 IN GOLD TO PLACE AND MAINTAIN THE COUNTRY ON A GOLD BASIS THE YIELD OF THE PUBLIC REVENUE IN 1915 WAS 8500770474 GP PESOS AS AGAINST 8239992455 GP PESOS IN 1914 PUBLIC EXPENDITURES FOR 1915 WERE 6784128364 GP PESOS WHICH EXCEEDED THE AMOUNT ESTIMATED BY 777864365 GP PESOS THE TOTAL VALUE OF TRADE

TRADE BAL ANCE FOR GUATEMALA OF 649410993 GOLD TWO CAUSES ESPECIALLY AFFECT CENTRAL AMERICAN TRADE AND FINANCE THE LOSS OF THE USUAL MARKETS IN EUROPE AND THE INADEQUACY OF TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES THE REPUBLIC OF GUATEMALA IN PARTIC ULAR LOST ITS NORMAL OUTLET FOR COFFEE THE LARGEST OF ITS EXPORT COMMODITIES A VERY CORDIAL FEELING HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN GUATEMALA TO WARDS THE UNITED STATES AND WHILE A GOOD PORTION OF THEIR IMPORTS ORIGINATE IN THIS COUNTRY A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE OF BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS SHOULD BE EXPLOITED AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE OPPOR TUNITIES AT PRESENT TO MAKE OUR APPEALS FORCIBLE IT BECOMES NECESSARY TO INVEST MORE CAPITAL IN THE REPUBLIC TO EXTEND MORE LIBERAL CREDITS TO IMPROVE BANKING FACILITIES FOR EXPORT TRADE AND TO MAKE MORE DIRECT AND PERSONAL EFFORTS IN THEIR MARKETS AT PRESENT THEY NEED FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE AND SHIPPING FACILITIES PER HAPS MORE THAN OTHER LATIN AMERICAN COUNTRIES IT IS ESSENTIAL FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE FOREIGN PURCHASING POWER OF GUATEMALA TO LEND HELP IN DEVELOPING AND MARKETING THEIR PRODUCTS ABROAD THE COMPARATIVE TABLES WHICH FOLLOW SHOW THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR TRADE RELATIONS WITH THAT REPUBLIC EXPORTS FROM GUATEMALA TO

HUNDRED MILES OF RAILWAY IN THE REPUBLIC THE SYSTEM INCLUDES A TRANSCONTINENTAL LINE FROM SAN JOSE ON THE PACIFIC COAST TO PUERTO BARRIOS ON THE ATLANTIC CONSIDERED THE BEST BUILT RAILWAY OF ANY OF THE CENTRAL AMERICAN LINES WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE PANAMA RAILWAY THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE REPUBLIC IS WEBBED WITH 200 MILES OF RAIL 270 ON THE PACIFIC SIDE AND 30 FOR THE INTERIOR THESE ROADS ARE PRACTI CALLY ALL OWNED BY AMERICAN INTERESTS AND REPRESENT IN A MEASURE THE ONLY INVESTMENT IN THAT REPUBLIC OF NORTH AMERICAN CAPITAL GERMAN AND ENGLISH INVESTMENTS PREDOMINATE IN ALL OTHER UNDER TAKINGS PRINCIPALLY THAT OF COFFEEGROWING TO DEVELOP MINING THE GOVERNMENT HAS GRANTED THE PRIVILEGE OF FREE DUTY ON MACHINERY AND OTHER IMPLEMENTS NECESSARY FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF THAT INDUSTRY ORES OF IRON LEAD ZINC SILVER LIGNITE OF VERY GOOD QUALITY SULPHUR AND ROCK SALT ARE FOUND IN ABUNDANCE PROSPECTING FOR PETROLEUM HAS RECENTLY BEEN UNDERTAKEN AND THE OPINION EXISTS THAT THE SEARCH WILL BE SUCCESSFUL THE GREATEST OBSTACLE HOWEVER TO A RAPID PROGRESS OF THESE ENTERPRISES IS CAPITAL TO ADEQUATELY EX PLOIT THE VAST MINERAL DEPOSITS GRAZING HAS ALSO HAD CONSIDERABLE DEVELOPMENT BUT THERE IS LITTLE OUTGO OF MEAT PRODUCTS MOST OF THE CATTLE BEING CONSUMED IN THE COUNTRY WITH ONLY THE HIDES FOR EXPORT THERE IS MUCH TALK AT PRESENT OF DEVELOPMENTS IN CATTLE RAISING AND THE GOVERNMENT SEEMS DISPOSED TO LEND ASSISTANCE TO ANY PROPER VENTURE OF THIS KIND IT SEEMS EASIER FOR THE CENTRAL AMERICAN TO LIVE ON THE PROD UCTS OF HIS OWN COUNTRY THAN FOR MOST OTHER PEOPLE AND THIS PARTICU LARLY IS TRUE OF GUATEMALA WHICH IS PRIMARILY AN AGRICULTURAL COUNTRY WITH COMPARATIVELY LITTLE MANUFACTURING AND SCARCITY OF CAPITAL FOR ITS DEVELOPMENT 184

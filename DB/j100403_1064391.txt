reasoning that the lex loci contractus governed the case It would seem that even though the contract had been made in a state other than Pennsylvania if the action were properly brought there the law of Pennsylvania must have been applied since the law of the forum governs and not necessarily the law of the place where the con tract is made The court in basing its decision upon the ground that the lexi loci contractus governed would seem to negative this conclusion CORPORATIONSEQUITYDISREGARD OF LEGAL FICTIONSThe defendant was a holding corporation owning controlling interests in eight other corporations the chief officers of the holding corporation filling practi cally all of the chief offices in the other corporations The plaintiff a stockholder in the defendant corporation filed a bill to compel the de fendant to produce not only its own but the books of the other com panies for discovery fraud being alleged Held the defendant must pro duce the books for discovery Martin v D B Martin Co Del 88 Atl 612 A corporation ordinarily is a legal entity distinct and separate from its stockholders Button v Hoffman 61 Wis 20 20 N W 667 50 Am Rep131 But to prevent fraud equity will disregard the legal fiction of a separate individual and consider a corporation as an association First Nat Bank v Trebein Co 59 Ohio St 316 52 N E 834 Thus it has been held where two separate corporations are controlled by the same directors their corporate individuality will be disregarded to the extent of annulling contracts between them Bill v Western Union Tel Co 16 Fed 14 And when several corporations transfer their prop erty in exchange for stock in a new company an original stockholder may maintain an action directly against the new company for stock Anthony v American Glucose Co 146 N Y 407 41 N E 23 It is set tled that a stockholder always has the right to examine the books of the corporation upon a reasonable demand Corn v Phoenix etc Co 105 Pa St 111 51 Am Rep 184 And although there seems to be no direct authority for such an order as was granted in the principal case yet by analogy to the above and other authorities it would seem that it was properly granted CORPORATIONSTRANSFER or ASSETSRIGHTS OF CREDITORSA corpora tion pending a suit against it by creditors transferred all of its property to a second corporation which latter assumed payment of some of the formers debts but not those which were the subject of the pending suit In consideration of such transfer the purchasing corporation issued its own stock to the stockholders of the selling corporation The cred itors of the selling corporation brought suit to subject the transferred property in the possession of the purchasing corporation to the pay ment of their debts Held such property is a trust fund and can be fol lowed and subjected to the payment of the debts Jcennins ANeff  Co v Crystal Ice Co Tenn 159 S W 1088 While the ultimate result reached in the principal case is undoubtedly 327328 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW correct on the facts the implication of the trust fund theory is open to criticism The capital stock of a corporation is the basis of its credit and is a substitute for the individual liability of its stockholders Ordinarily no trust relation exists towards creditors and the corporation holds its property in the same respect as does an individual debtor in this re lation a corporation is an entity as much distinct from its stockholders as from its creditors Hollins v Breirfield etc Co 150 U S 371 Hospes v Northwestern etc Co 48 Minn 174 50 N W 1117 Southworth v Morgan 205 N Y 293 98 N E 490 For this reason the transfer by a corporation of all its property for a consideration which inures not to itself but to its stockholders constitutes a fraudulent voluntary convey ance which may be set aside at the suit of its creditors the latter can not be compelled to go against the consideration in the hands of the stockholders but may continue to look to their original securitythe property of their debtor The gist of the action is fraud Wabash St Louis  Pac R v Ham 114 U S 587 But when a corporation becomes insolvent and its assets are being administered by a court of equity then a trust does arise in favor of creditors in the limited sense that their debts must be paid before the stockholders can claim any interest Graham v Railwcay Co 102 U S 148 COOK CORPORATIONS 7 ed  9 CRIMINAL LAWARRAIGNMENT AND PLEANECESSITYThe record in a felony trial failed to disclose the arraignment and plea of the defendant Defendant entered his objection after verdict Held the failure of the record to disclose arraignment and plea is a fatal error Burroughs v State Neb 143 N W 450 There is conflict among the decisions involving the question in the principal case One view is that arraignment and plea is merely a formal requirement which is impliedly waived by the defendants going to trial on the merits without objection People v Ostcrhlout 34 Hun N Y 260 State v Straub 16 Wash 111 47 Pac 227 State v Hayes 67 Iowa 27 24 N W 575 This view however has not been received with much favor and is perhaps dependent upon statutes regulating criminal trials in those states which hold this doctrine A respectable number of cases while not holding that arraignment and plea is a merely formal requirement lay down the rule that ar raignment and plea is waived by the defendants going to trial without objection Hack v State 141 Wis 346 124 N WV 492 People v Weeks 165 Mich 362 130 N W 697 Since an issue is essential to a valid trial and since there can be no issue until a plea is entered it is difficult to see how these decisions can be upheld on principle The weight of authority is in line with the decision in the principal case in holding that arraignment and plea is a matter of substance that omission of arraignment and plea is a denial of due process of law and that the failure of the prisoner to object before verdict is not a waiver This is the doctrine of the United States Supreme Court Crait v U S 162 U S 625 where the objection was first made in the appellate court Bowen v State 108 Ind 411 9 N E 378 This doctrine has been

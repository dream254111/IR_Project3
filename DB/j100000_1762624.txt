graphical Societies have appeared almost simultaneously and con tain interesting details on the travellers experience in Central Africa Junker entered this region in I879 travelling from Suez to Suakim and thence to Berber From Berber a steamer conveyed him to Shartum where he arrived in the beginning of January I880 It was his intention to explore the regions on the Welle and to follow that stream as far as possible to the west His plan the Egyptian BarelGasal Province He had formerly prohibited the passage of the ivorycaravans through his country and would suffer no station to be established in the districts under his sway Adopting a plan followed in all subsequent journeys Jutlker sent messengers forward to Ndoruma to give him particulars about his intentions and to announce that Junker travelled without military escort This plan proved very successful and enabled Junker to live generally on good terms with the rulers of the countries through which he travelled His success shows that in Africa as well as in all other countries the traveller who is willing to adopt the mode of MAP SHOWING JUNKERS EXPLORATIONS IN CENTRAL AFRICA was to start from Lado but this was made impossible by the grass barriers which had closed the Nile for months Therefore he took a steamer going up the BarelGasal and arrived at MeshraerRek in February fIere the landjourney began and in company with Gessi Pacha he travelled by way of Jur Ghattas Wau and Dem Idris to Dem Suleiman the head station of the BarelGasal Province After a short stay at that place he turned south to Dem Bekir where his real work of exploration began His first object was the exploration of Ndorumas territory which is situated on the watershed between the BarelGasal and the Welle Ndoruma a powerful NiamNiam chief had been at war with the troops of life and to accommodate himself to the way of thinking of the natives will accomplish his plans with comparative safety and will glean ample results Subsequently Junker made his headquarters in the village of a chief whose confidence he had gained and made excursions from these stations This makes his routes very trust worthy most of thern leading back to the startingpoint After having seen Ndoruma and gained his confidence Junker started from Dem Bekir in May I880 with two hundred and fifty bearers and in a fortnight reached the huts of Ndoruma On his way he crossed many tributaries of the Mbomo and found in their valleys a luxuriant vegetation which more to the east does not occur tillSCIFNCE 5 far south Ndoruma wished him to reInain some time at his vil lage and therefore Junker resolved to set up a station there for the coming months With the help of Ndorumas people who were despatched to the rork by hundreds he was able to erect good substantial dwellings which were surrounded by a high stockade to keep off the leopalds which abound ln this country He staid here until August when he left his companion Bohndorff in charge of the station while he travelled south with only turenty bearers He crossed the Welle and traversed the land of the Mangbatu where he made friendship svith the chief Mambango and returned in December to Ndoruma l3ut as the best season for travel ling had approached he did not rest but started in January I88I by a new roacl to the southwest the country of the AMadi crossed the Welle there again and obtained though with the greatest difficulty the necessary number of bearers among the ABarambo these hoxvever robbed him of part of his goods and it was only with the help of Sasa a friendly NiamNiam chief that he safely returned to the AMadi coudntry north of the Welle At the end of April he sent Bohndorff with the baggage under the care of Sasa into the latters country south of the Mbomo where he was to establish another permanent station In the mean time war had broken out between the Mangbatu and Emin Bey the governor of the Equatorial Province but by Junkers mediation further hostilities urere prevented This honvever detained him until the end of November I88I Then he made another start and was almost uninterruptedly on the way up to June I882 ex ploring the region south of the Welle and Bomokandi He was lindly received by the NiamNiam chiefs Bakangai and Kana whose villages are situated south of the Bomokandi whence he turned north and reached Semio north of the Mbomo where his station had been meanwhile established in September I882 Here he had the misfortune to lose a great part of his valuable property by fire Bohndorff who had frequently been sick wished to return to iEurope and therefore Junker packed his collections and sent him to the BarelGasal Prosrince where in the mean while Lup ton Bey had become governor But at this time the Dinka tribes revolted against the Egyptian Government and thus BohndorfT being unable to reach MeshraerRek was compelled to return to Semio This was in October I882 the commencement of long and bloody wars in the BarelGasal territory on which finally the in vasion of the Mahdis troops followed Before Bohndorffs return Junker hacl started on an extensive journey west He reached the Welle near the mouth of the Werre and Mbima and traversed the territory of the Bandjia who though speaking a dialect of the NiamNiam language pretend to be of an independent descent The islands of the Welle are inhalzited by the ABasango who speak a distinct language After having reached AliKobo he turned north crossed the Mbomo ascended the Shinko and returned to Semio by way of Mbanga He arrived on May I o I 883 He now regarded his travels as finished and intended to start for the BarelGasal urhere Bohnclorff had gone a short time be fore as Lupton Bey hoped that the route to MeshraerRek would Xbe open But although Lupton called in all the outlying garrisons on the Welle he did not succeed in putting down the Dinka who afterwards were joined by the Nuer Agar and other tribes This war lasted eighteen months and was far more bloody and exhaust ing for both parties than the later engagements against the troops of the Mahdi in Emin Pachas province Finally the Dinka were supported by the Mahdis forces and Lupton betrayed by those about him was compelled to deliver his province without resistance to the emissary of the Mahdi Emir Karm Allah Junker says that the chief cause of this surrender is tv be sought in the fact that Lupton hacl almost exclusively irregular troops at his disposal con sisting of Dongola people and Arabs of all kinds In October I883 the state of Luptons troops was very precarious and he sent a letter to Junker entreating him to persuade the chief Semio to collect about a thousand of his people with spear and shield as well as all those who had guns and come to his help EIe said  I now see no other way of putting down the insurrection than by the help 70f the NiamNiam chiefs Do every thing in your power to per suade Semio tolose no time and send him to 1neet me as soon as possible As Junker saw the routes north closed he resolved to go east to Lado He left Semio in November ISS3 and reached Emin at Lado in January I88A after fiftyfive days march During this time Bohndorff was able to reach Khartum with the steamer returning thither at the end of December but all collections re mained behind Emin Pachas province had been quiet up to the first months of I 884 but the successes of the Dinka were too tempting for the other negro tribes and so in the Equatorial Province the rebellion assumed more formidable proportions Emin was compelled to give up all stations east of the Nile and to concentrate his troops On the 27th of May he and Junker received letters from Lupton Bey and Emir Walm Allah which contained the news that the province had fallen into the hands of the Mahdi and the demand to sur1ender the Equatorial Province Emin answered the Emirs letter saying that he was ready to deliver the province into the hands of the representative of the Mahdi in order to prevent useless bloodshed and till his arrival he would try to hold the province for the Mahdi Meanwhile a defence was organized alld the outlying stations were callecl in But it was not until January I885 that the troops of the Mahdi attacked Emins province After they had taken the station Amadi in April of the same year they re treated for unknown reasons by forced marches to the Barel Gasal region Since that time Emins province has been unmolested by the troops of the Mahdi On Jan 2 I886 Junker left Emin Pacha and Casati going south lIe crossed the Mvutan Nsige to Kibiro and went to Kabrega king of Unyoro Here he learned by letters from Zanzibar of the events in the Sudan of King Mwangas hostility towards the Suropeans and of Dr Fischers unsuccessful expedition sent out by Junkers brother to seek him In the mean time rar had broken out between the Waganda and Wanyoro and it was not until June that he received permission to enter Mwangas capital It took him a month and a half to cross the Victoria Nyanza and at last Tabora ras reached whence he proceeded with one of TippoTips caravans to Zanzibar Thus his eventful wanderings in Central Africa were ended It is hardly necessary to mention the importance of his explorations which cover a large area and of his interesting observations on the tribes with xvhom he lived for so long a time The loss of his large collections will be regretted by naturalists and ethnologists but nevertheless we should be glad that the enterprising traveller suc ceeded in extricating himself from the innumerable dangers and difficulties surrounding him BOOK  REVIEWS Report of the Commsttee ows l9zszgfcstatsts of thve Amerscan PubDc LeaEthv Sssorzatzon Concord NH Republ Pr Assoc S THE report of the committee on clisinfectants of the American Public Health Association presented at the Toronto meeting in October last has justbeen printed It deals with the various ap paratuses now in use in this country and Europe for disinfection by means of heat and is abu1ldantly illustrated The experiments of this committee have demonstrated that the most efficient non destructive disinfectants are I steam under pressure at IIOQ C 230 F for ten rninutes 2 dry heat at I IO C 230C F for two hours in tlle absence of spores 3 boiling in svater for onehalf to one hour It will be seen from this that the apparatus for disin fection by heat may be divided into three classes I that in which dry hot air is employed 2 that in which hot moist air is used and 3 that in which steam is the disinfecting agent In the disinfection of mattresses feather beds etc where great penetrating power is required dry hot alr cannot be relied upon In addition to this there is another objection to the use of this agent that when the temperature is sufficiently high to act as a clisinfectant certain articles are permanently injured by it The committee expresses its conviction that the use of steam and especially when superheated or under pressure is the most eSi cient agent for the destruction of all sorts of infectious material At the Boston quarantine station Dr S H Durgin president of the Boston board of health and a member of the committee has been employing moist heat for disinfecting purposes since the spring of JULY 29 I 887

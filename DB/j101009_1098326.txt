Virginia died at his home at the University on July 29 1895 in the eightythird year of his age He was born in Louisa county Virginia June 2 1813 the son of Launcelot Minor and the youngest of nine children He attended the neighborhood schools until about the age of sixteen when he was sent to Kenyon College Ohio walking the entire distance in company with a young kinsman Those who are familiar with the enormous labors that filled the last fifty years of his life will be surprised to know that this trip to Ohio on foot was taken with a view to improve his delicate health and that previously thereto he had made a trip on horseback through a large part of Virginia for exercise and air acting the while as agent and collector for certain newspapers The return trip from Ohio after a year spent at Kenyon College was also made on foot and embraced a tour of the State of New York by way of Niagara Albany and New York City It was an earnest of that sturdiness of character for which he was conspicuous in after life that determined to see the sights of the great city and his money having run low he secured passage on a vessel to sail at a future day and spent some ten days in New York living on almost nothing In January 1831 he entered the University of Virginia where he remained for three sessions graduating in several of the academic schools and finally in June 1834 receiving the degree of Bachelor of Law His teacher in the school of law in which he himself was des tined to win such imperishable fame was Professor John A G Davis the second occupant of that chair and during his whole course as a student at the University he taught school in the family of Professor DavisVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER After his graduation he began the practice of his profession at Bu chanan in Botetourt county Virginia and here many of the qualities for which he was afterwards so distinguished and which made possible his great success at once began to manifest themselves the boylawyer was father to the man Every lawyer who recalls his first half dozen years at the bar will agree that it required a fine courage and admira ble selfconfidence in the young attorney at a strange and able bar where he found the practice very lax to resolutely determine that he would not follow but lead and that for himself he would not ask nor accept any relaxation of the strictest requirements of good pleading And how exquisite must have been the tact and temper which enabled him to pursue such a course in such manner as not only to give no offense but in time to completely reform the practice at that bar It was more than fortyfive years afterwards that the following incident which illustrates another phase of his character to which we shall presently refer occurred at his own table A young pupil of his a graduate and practitioner of a few years remembering to have heard the story just recited told him that he had begun his own professional life by observing most strictly the best rules of pleading and practice even writing out his demurrers and pleas in the most trivial cases Then I will predict said the host recalling his own early expe rience that it was not long before all the bar were following your example No sir replied the youth it was not long before I was following their example In the laughter and merriment that followed no one joined with more genial and hearty goodnature than the venerable teacher as lhe said Ah you should have persevered they would all have conme to you After about six years at the Botetourt bar he moved to Charlottes ville and formed a partnership with his brother Lucian Minor after wards Professor of Law in the College of William and Mary He was accustomed to say that to this brother he owed almost everything he was his preceptor in academics and in lawhis guide philosopher and friend and between the two there existed the closest and most beautiful affection until the death of Lucian in 1858 This partner ship existed for three years when it was dissolved for a reason unique in the history of the profession and which throws a valuable and in teresting sidelight upon the characters of the two men Each had acquired such confidence in the judgment and attainments of the other that if they agreed on a point under discussion they were reluctant to examine it further this they soon found to be so detrimental to the at 474 Novtainment of the ideal which they seem to have set before their eyes that it was mutually agreed that it would be best that each should be thrown on his own resources and accordingly Lucian removed to Louisa county while John B remained in Charlottesville During his ten years at the bar he seems to have studied the law and the reason thereof with intense eagerness and enthusiasm and with that remarkable clearness of conception firmness of grasp and unyielding rigor of analysis for which he afterwards became so famous The writer remembers to have heard the late Hon Alexander H H Stuart who was a contemporary and often met him at the bar speak of his familiarity with the most difficult rules and forms of practice and the profound and accurate knowledge of legal principles which he displayed at that time and of the delight with which he discussed all subjects pertaining to his profession He seemed even at that early day to breathe the very atmosphere of law and as he said of himself long years afterwards to live by labor In 1845 at the age of thirtytwo he was elected to the professor ship of law in the University of Virginia Standing as we do today at the completion of his career and viewing his great work as a whole it is an interesting commentary on the futility of human foresight to be told that there was strong opposition to his appointment and great surprise throughout the State that a man so young and so little known should have been selected for so important a position His immediate predecessor was Judge Henry St George Tucker resigned who had succeeded Professor Davis on tle death of the latter in 1840 The facts seem to justify the statement that he followed the footsteps of his old teacher rather than those of his predecessor but that he was not a mere copyist of either He not only restored the traditional severity of the standard of graduation but he elevated it During his first ten years he graduated only nine per cent of the matriculatesa much smaller proportion than had received the coveted degree during the four years under Judge Tucker or the ten years of Professor Daviss service thorough and efficient as was the instruction under those teachers The difficulty of the course under him however does not seem to have deterred applicants for its honors on the contrary the numbers steadily and rapidly increased from twentyeight when he be gan to more than one hundred in a few years with an average attendance in recent years of about one hundred and forty From the time of his appointment until 1851 he was the sole teacher of law at the University In the latter year James P Holcombe was 1895 475 JOHN B MINORVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER appointed Adjunct Professor of Law and the classes were increased from two to three three years later Mr Holcombe was made full pro fessor and in 1856 the course was expanded into two departments of two classes each Mr Minor becoming Professor of Common and Statute Law and this form was continued until very recent years when great and important changes were made in the course During the period of the civil war he again maintained the entire burden of the law school but was relieved of the double duty in 1866 by the appoint ment of an additional teacher In 1870 he began his private Summer Course of Law Lectures extending over two months of the University vacation which have be come so popular with beginners and with practitioners of all ages The class of 1874 numbered twenty members and from that time the numbers rapidly increased to an average attendance of about ninety in recent years attaining in 1892 to a maximum of one hundred and twentyone This was the first course of the kind ever offered in this country and was the pioneer of the numerous summer schools which have become a feature of so many of our universities and col leges It is probable that his superior as a teacher of law has never lived It is not the voice of affection or flattery merely that has so declared it is the deliberate judgment of mature minds that have reflected on the subject Certain it is that in the great work of his life he achieved a success unparalleled in any age or country Much of that success was undoubtedly due to his method of instruction the salient feature of which was the analytical system of Hale and Blackstone which was carried by him far beyond anything ever before attempted That method cannot be described in a few words more aptly than was done by Senator Daniel in his recent address at the University on the occa sion of the unveiling of the marble bust of Mr Minor when he said Adopting the system of analysis which was delineated by Hale and amplified by Blackstone he built upon it those expositions of common law principles and statutory alterations which reveal the law to the minds eye as a topographical map of a country cast in bus relief His pupils see the law in looking at his an alysis on a blackboard or on a printed page as you will see on such a cast the out line of boundaries and the courses of streams and realize the relative importance of the main principles with their ramifications and exceptions as they would realize the proportionate elevation of mountains and plains and valleys To this analytical system he added his oral lectures as if a painter were to come along and turn the map into a picture clothing the naked landscape with animation and verdure   He enables the student to grasp principles in detail witll con 476 Novtemporaneous sense of their comparative importance and to take step by step with cleverness firmness and precision It would be impossible to say how much Mr Minor has contributed to the clearness and accuracy of the general legal mind especially in Virginia and the South by the mere use of this logical and scientific arrangement of his matter For many years after the beginning of his career at the University a skeleton analysis of each lecture was written by him on the black board and thence copied by the class for some years prior to 1875 these were lithographed to the great relief of both teacher and pupils In the latter year the first and second volumes of the  Institutes of Common and Statute Law were published Their fourth edition ap peared in 1891 and 1892 In 1878 the first edition of the fourth volume was published and its third edition in 1893 in two parts The third volume was delayed being first issued in instalments in pIamphlet form for the use of his classes but finally in 1895 being completed in two books and issued as a second edition In 1894 he published in one volume an  Exposition of the Law of Crimes and Punishments Of that great work the Institutes it is not necessary to speak more particularly here Undertaken originally with the purpose of presenting in print a mere tabular analysis of his course of instruction intended primarily for tlle use of his own students and put forth so modestly in 1875 it has passed through edition after edition has be come indispensable to the Virginia lawyer and is cited as authority in all the courts including the Federal Supreme Court To quote Senator Daniel again it cannot be surpassed as a vade mnecum of the law It is like a statuesolid compact clean cut Thomas Jefferson lamented that Mathew Bacon adopted the alphabetical or dictionary system in his abridgment How a scientific mind like his would have delighted in a scientific work like this    The Roman forum had an empty place lacking Catos figure and a lawyers library without this book has one also But in every school the teacher is more than his method and Mr Minors success was due first of all and far above all to the man himself  It requires two workmen and no more nor will less suffice  says a modern law author to make a great lawyerthe Almighty and the man himself In what beautiful harmony the two workmen wrought in the example before us God gave him great powers and a great opportunity with humble acknowledgment of their source he 1895 477 JOH B MINORVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER used them with high purpose and to a great end He grasped the full significance of his own great missionto mould the hearts and minds of the men who above all others should in turn influence the lives of their fellowmen He had that high conception of the lawyers calling without which as he believed no worthy success in the profession was possible and the spirit of that conception illumined all his teaching He loved young men and he had a profound sympathy with youtll In his dealings with his pupils there was a frank but dignified cordiality which won at once their confidence and their respect their relations did not end with the formalities of the classroom his study and his home were ever open to them and there they were his welcome guests and his friends In the lectureroom he was supreme His enthusiasm for his sub ject was such as to arouse the most inattentive and stimulate the dullest of his hearers His didactic and expository powers were unsurpassed To a remarkable clearness of statement were added a wealtli and apti tude of illustration and a vivid and luminous commentary that left nothing in doubt or uncertainty Clearness of conception wide reading of the best models and long practice had given him an exquisite dic tion a rich and copious vocabulary a rare capacity for impressive and even eloquent utterance and a mastery of modulated tone and expres sion that embraced every change of thought or shade of meaning His lectures were in the conversational style based on the pupils answers to questions on the text of the lesson previously assigned for study the questions being skilfully framed to test the knowledge of the pupil and usually capable of a categorical answer It is doubtful if any teacher ever received from his classes closer or more respectful attention In deed inattention listlessness or any minor breach of decorum was almost sure to bring one immediately to the stand to be questioned on the lesson while for those rare instances of more serious transgression the quick glance of indignant surprise that flashed from those clear eyes and upon occasion the brief but keen and pointed appeal to the self respect of the offender were amply sufficient His scorn and contempt of everything mean or unmanly were of themselves an impressive les son to the beholder He loved truth and right and justice with an enthusiastic an unquenchable love and when they were violated his righteous indignation scarcely knew bounds But to him truth and right and justice were more than the mere expressions of the ethics of a given timeiore than the measure of mans dealing with manaye more than the bases and the objects and the ends of the law they were 478 Novthe attrbutes of the Divine Creator and Mastertheir seat was the bosom of God and in his view to miss this conception in the pursuit of them was to grasp the shadow for the substance So he believed and lived and so he taught and it seems to the writer that to leave out of view these basal facts of his characterhis firm hold on the Christian faith and his constant effort to live by its teachingsis to fail to catch the informing and animating spirit of his life and work and to miss the true secret of his power This was the masterchord in his life the source of that rare union of sweetness with dignity of gentleness with firmness that helped to make up his charming personalitythe spring of that burning desire manifested without ostentation or display to bring into the ways of righteousness all with whom he came in contact It is no wonder that such a character left an indelible impression upon the minds of his pupils His example sanctioned and verified his pre cepts If he invoked for thenm after the manner of Lord Coke the gladsoime light of jurisprudence the loveliness of temperance the sta bility of fortitude the solidity of justice all these were his own If he urged them as he so often did after the example of a greater than Coke to pure living and noble thinking to reverence their conscience as their king to be not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the Lord here were all these things done before their very eyes He was the embodiment and best illustration of his own theme And how many of the youth of the land have passed under his moulding hand A careful estimate fixes their number at something like six thousand For fifty years to regular session and summer course they came from every city and town and hamlet of his native State and fiom every State of the Union and sat at his feet he set his seal and image upon them and sent them forth into the world proud of their lineage they were John B men They have become legis lators congressmen senators State and Federal judges and cabinet ministers they have carried into every avenue of public and private life the leaven of his example and teaching The belief to which one of his older pupils and olne well worthy to stand as the type of his class has given expression in a recent number of the VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER would seem to be well founded That Prof Minor in the fifty years of his work in the law school of the University has exerted and still indirectly exerts a wider influence for good upon society in the United States than any man who has lived in this generation Mr Minor taught the common law as the historical source and basis of nearly all our jurisprudence His familiarity with its doctrines was 1895 479 JOHN B MINORVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER unequalled he was simply devoted to its ancient forms and principles He opposed vehemently nearly every effort to soften its rigors he seemed to lament almost as a personal loss the most antiquated writ or proceeding that fell under the legislative axe So ardent was his ad miration for the common law procedure pure and undefiled by statu tory relaxations and so stoutly did he refuse his assent to any proposi tion to introduce into it anything of ail equitable breadth or freedom that it is scarcely too much to say of him that had he been on the bench he would have rejoiced like Baron Parke in nonsuiting the plaintiff in an undefended cause He could not even listen with patience to the suggestion of codepractice and it is undoubtedly due in great measure to his influence that the advocates of that system have been unable to make any progress of consequence in this State Indeed if the sug gestion may be permitted it is offered with unfeigned diffidence and with reverent affection but with a firm conviction of its truth and justice his dislike of everything new in the lawthe pertinacity with which he clung to the ancient doctrines and procedure of the common law and the strenuous opposition with which he met every suggestion of change amendment or amelioration even though they were de manded by the changed conditions of society and approved by the inevitable growth and development of the law as evidenced for ex ample by his unrelenting hostility to the statutes known as the Married Womens Acts and to the act abolishing the privy examination of mar ried women and to the act making husband and wife competent as witnesses for or against each other constituted a defectperhaps his only defectas a lawyer an author and a teacher But then what would you have If fifty years in the classroom a full half century of unopposed opinion had left him entirely free from dogmatism to what perfection must he have attained And would his wonderful suc cess as a teacher have been possible otherwise  And then on the other hand who shall justly estimate the value of his conservatism  Among the most striking features of Mr Minors character were his tireless industry and his amazing capacity for work A mere recital of his labors is wearisome For a long time as we have seen he carried the whole burden of the law school Besides the arranging and sys tematising of a course of instruction ever widening in scope and grow ing in illustrative matter for which during so many years a daily analysis for each lecture had to be made and written on the board the preparing of questions for examination and the reading of examination papers the careful and conscientious performance of a great deal of 480 Novgeneral work for the University incident to his position as a member of the Faculty he wrote and indexed his books with his own hands read and corrected the proofs himself and maintained a voluminous correspondence with lawyers and judges seeking his opinion on all manner of legal questions which he would only give after consulting all the authorities within his reach often devoting the labor of several days to a single opinion and for none of which did he ever receive a fee And with all he was most punctilious in the performance of his social duties It must have been a splendid will splendidly trained that sustained such enormous tasks through so many years witiout variance or turning and almost without rest or recreation In fact to the close observer of his life of steady and unchanging purpose and unremitting toil it would seem that his motto might well have been that of the starsohne hast ohne rast No sketch of Mr Minor would be complete that failed to mention his love for the University of Virginia and his devotion to all its interests These were manifested on more than one occasion when almost the very existence of the institution seemed at stake Thus during the war on the occasion of Sheridans march from the Valley it was only after the most persistent personal efforts of Mr Minor and his colleague the late Dr Maupin that a guard of Federal soldiers was secured to prevent the pillage and not improbable burning of the buildings the two pro fessors meanwhile leaving their families unprotected from the arnoy ances and depredations of the stragglers and campfollowers Again in the summer of 1865 when the University treasury was empty the buildings in great dilapidation and reported throughout the country as actually and totally destroyed having been confounded with the Vir ginia Military Institute which had been burned by the Federal soldiery and when the gloom of those troubled times had settled over Faculty and Visitors alike the latter having adjourned in despair Mr Minor and Dr Maupin again came to the rescue and alone in their own names and on their own credit borrowed from a bank in Charlottesville the money necessary for systematic and extensive advertising and to make the needed repairs which they superintended in person and in other ways to prepare for the session of 186566 They were rewarded for their diligence and selfsacrifice by a matriculation list of more than four hundred students and so well did they manage the affairs of the session that they paid back the money they had borrowed paid all the current expenses and handed over a surplus to the Board of Visitors when they met again in June 1866 1895 481 JOHN B MINORVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Mr Minor was thrice married and a widow and four daughters and two sons survive him IHe was peculiarly blessed in his domestic rela tions and was constantly surrounded and ministered to in his own home by the most deferential and devoted tenderness There his will was law but his law was love and answering affection ran to anticipate its com mands He delighted to have his family about him and while ever tender and affectionate interested in the simplest matters that concerned them he was the firmest of men the weakness of parental indulgence found no place in his calm and reasoned life His charity and hospi tality were without stint or limit It is doubtful if any worthy object ever appealed to him without meeting prompt and even generous re sponse His home was ever open to a large family connection to his pupils to friends innumerable and a sincere and cordial welcome awaited them all But the merest mention of his homelife would be inadequate if it omitted to notice an exercise which could not be easily forgotten by one who had participated in itthe family prayers at the close of the morning and evening meals No occasion was too great no guest too high or too low to cause the omission of this simple but beautiful service which must have left an impress for good on the hearts of many During the last fortytwo years of his life he was a member of the Protestant Episcopal Church and for many years was a vestry man of Christ Church in Charlottesville For a long period before the close of the war he was the superintendent of a Sunday school of slaves As has been said already he loved young men he was accustomed to say that the promise and possibilities of a young man about to begin his career stirred his heart as nothing else did he followed the careers of his own pupils with the keenest interest But his solicitude for them did not stop at their material welfare After the close of the war he commenced a Sunday morning Bible class of students which he taugllt until the close of his life teaching during the last session in his study being then unable to walk so far as the lectureroom And it is said of him that he probably never lost an opportunity to press on his pupils in private with gentle and engaging manner but with his own impres sive certainty of conviction the claims of personal religion Indeed his growth in Christian grace and virtue seemed to be steady and unin terrupted to the end as the lengthening years grew and multiplied upon him his spiritual life and thought went deeper and deeper like a wall that runs out into the sea His presence was as noble and impressive as his character Of com manding stature he was full six feet in height erect compact and well 482 Novproportioned frame finely shaped and massive head with high and in tellectual brow snowwhite hair and beard firm and finely chiselled mouth with closely shaven upper lip wide clear grey eyes that seeihed to sweep in everything with their glance of quick and keen intelli gencesuch are mere outlines of the portrait If it were possible to fill in here the details which will be supplied by the affectionate memo ries of hundreds who will look upon it there might be added some touch of the gracious and winning mannerthe kindling enthusiasmthe withering flash of indignation and scorn at some injustice or wrongthe deep and kindly sympathies quickly stirredthe subtle impression of wisdom and dignity and strengththe indefinable sense of purity and nobility and truth The task of loving but faithful portraiture grows more delicate and difficult  I think that it would be better that you should not attempt to review my books he once said to a former pupil your affection for the author would probably unfit you for the office of critic The same spirit of uncompromising honesty would prompt him to bid his biographer extenuate nothing It is not pretended that he had attained to perfectness of life and character Those who know his real excel lence will know how such a claim made for him would have grieved and humbled him In common with most men of deep and sincere and earnest natures his disposition was ardent and impetuous but so warm and sunny a sky could not be long oercast and the quickly passing storm left only the genial atmosphere of an exquisite and gra cious courtesy that was felt as an added charm His clear and strong convictions his almost fierce intolerance of sin and wrongdoing in fact the very depth and ardor of his religious nature may have seemed at times perhaps to give to his judgments something of the hardness of mere human justice but his indignation ever spent its heat on the sina tender compassion ever went out to the sinner These were all and they were growths of the same rich soil from which his virtues sprung He was but a man and only one perfect man has lived on earth But it is simple truth to say that he strove unceasingly to follow his great Exemplar that he lived his long life of supreme usefulness in the holy fear of God and he probably attained to as much of true nobility and moral excellence as is possible to human nature The infirmities of his character such as they may have been like the spots on the face of the sun were swallowed up in its noonday brightness His faculties were wonderfully preserved to the very last A well spent life had brought him its richest rewarda mature old age a per 1895 JOHN B MINOR 483VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER feet ripeness without decay and with all lifes longings and restlessness calmed into peace that was perfect and satisfied He died at his post as he would have desired He taught through the last session of the University and had begun his summer course when the sumnmons came Tlhe most interesting feature of the Finals at the University in June last was the unveiling of a lifesize marble bust of Mr Minor presented to the University library by the law alumni in commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of his incumbency of the chair of law The bust is mounted on a polished pedestal with the following inscription 1845 HE TAUGHT THE LAW AND THE REASON THEREOF 1895 It was presented by Mr James B Green instructor in the law de partment chairman of the bust committee was accepted on behalf of the University by Prof William M Thornton Chairman of the Faculty and the orator of the occasion on bellalf of the alumni was United States Senator John W Daniel a graduate of the law school In the public hall in the presence of a large and distinguished audience these gen tlemen delivered eloquent and glowing eulogies on the life and the work of the man they sought to honor but he did not hear them That innate modesty which characterized him kept him away But after wards at an informal reception at his home the loving multitude thronged about him pressing his hands and giving to their enthusiastic joy tender and tearful expression that brought the responsive tears to his own eyes It was a rare and touching scene an appropriate thougi unpremeditated farewell a beautiful finishing touch to a great and noble career For this was on June 12th and on July 29th  Gods finger touched him and he slept JAMES C LAMB Richmond Va Oct 10 1895

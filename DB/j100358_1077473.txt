j100358,The School Review,1077473,Grade Norms for Standard Tests,i244738,Grade norms for standard testsFrom the experience of teachers and supervisors in attempting to measure the results of instruction by means of educational tests there has developed a feeling of uncertainty concerning the significance and the validity of many of the reputed standards Lacking the facilities and the opportunity for attesting such norms as are announced for the instrument of measurement which he employs the individual attempting an interpretation of the scores of a group he has tested can but wonder whether there is any certainty that the situation indicated by the comparison of class scores with published norms really exists In this situation reports of results obtained by other teachers employing the same tests with other school children are often reassuring especially when large numbers of pupils tested in many different schools are involved Much interest will therefore attach to a recently issued summary of the results of administering several of the commonly used tests in a number of school systems The results presented in the bulletin are such as have been voluntarily reported to the Bureau of Educational Research by teachers and supervisors in the field Since the tests were given to pupils of varying abilities working under widely differing conditions and were administered at different periods of the school year the standards presented should be used only with due allowance for the possible errors of measurement and differences in pupils tested which may exist The method of the report is to present in the case of each test i the median scores by grades together with the 25 and 75 percentiles 2 the number of pupils attaining the indicated scores and 3 for most of the tests considered percentile tables derived from the original distribution With these data as a basis of comparison the teacher employing one of these tests can readily make the types of comparisons which will indicate the relative progress or skill of the group tested when measured by the records of large numbers of pupils in many different schools The tests for which tentative grade norms are presented are Monroes Standardized Reasoning Tests in WALTER S MONROE Report of the Division of Educational Tests for 191920 University of Illinois Bulletin Vol XVIII No 21 Urbana Illinois University of Illinois 1921 Pp 64 025634 THE SCHOOL REVIEW October Arithmetic Buckinghams Scale for Problems in Arithmetic Monroes Diag nostic Tests in Arithmetic Monroes Standardized Silent Reading Tests Charters Diagnostic Language Test and Language and Grammar Test Willings Scale for Measuring Written Composition Harlans Test for Infor mation in American History Sacketts Scale in United States History Hotzs First Year Algebra Scale Minnicks Geometry Tests Holleys Sentence Vocabulary Scale and Holleys Picture Completion Test for Primary Grades In addition the bulletin contains a chapter each devoted to Monroes Standardized Reasoning Tests in Arithmetic and Timed Sentence Spelling Tests

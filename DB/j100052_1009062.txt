J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009062,PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,I242463,PROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE INTRODUCTORY NOTE INTEREST IN SCIENTIFIC WORK OF ALL KINDS HAS INCREASED OF LATE SO RAPIDLY IN THE UNITED STATES AS TO ATTRACT THE ATTENTION OF OBSERVERS IN EVERY COUNTRY IN NO DEPARTMENT HAS THIS INTEREST BEEN MORE ACTIVE OR SCIENTIFIC PROGRESS BEEN MORE REAL THAN IN THE FIELD OF ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL STUDIES WE HAVE NOT IT IS TRUE AS YET MADE CON TRIBUTIONS WHICH WOULD ENTITLE US TO TAKE RANK WITH ENGLAND OR GER MANY OR FRANCE BUT IN NO COUNTRY IS THERE AT PRESENT A MORE HOPEFUL OUTLOOK FOR SCIENTIFIC WORK OF A HIGH CHARACTER ALONG THESE LINES THAN IN AMERICA THE EVIDENCE OF THIS IS CUMULATIVE AND ABUNDANT UNIVERSITY PRO FESSORS IN GERMANY AGREE PRETTY GENERALLY THAT THEY HAVE HAD IN THE LAST FIFTEEN YEARS NO MORE EAGER INDUSTRIOUS AND ABLE STUDENTS THAN THOSE WHO GO FROM THIS SIDE THE WATER UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS IN THIS COUNTRY TESTIFY TO THE STEADILY IMPROVING QUALITY AND CONTINUALLY GROW ING NUMBER OF STUDENTS INTERESTED IN THESE FIELDS THE GROWING FACILI TIES FOR STUDY ALONG THESE LINES IN OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS SPEAK MORE ELOQUENTLY THAN WORDS OF THE NEW ERA THAT HAS DAWNED UPON US IN THE LARGER COLLEGES THE FIELD HAS BEEN SUBDIVIDED SO AS TO PERMIT A DETAILED KIND OF WORK WHICH EVEN TEN YEARS AGO WAS IMPOSSIBLE IN THE SMALLER ONES IT HAS BEEN SEPARATED FROM OTHER AND DISSIMILAR FIELDS AND ENTRUSTED TO WHAT FIFTEEN YEARS AGO WAS ALMOST UNKNOWN OUTSIDE OF A FEW INSTITUTIONSTHE SPECIALIST FITTED BY TASTE AND TRAINING TO DO ORIGINAL WORK AS WELL AS TEACHING THE INSTRUCTION OFFERED AT HARVARD YALE COLUMBIA CORNELL MICHI GAN PENNSYLVANIA AND JOHNS HOPKINS IS NOT ONLY OF HIGH CHARACTER BUT OF A COMPREHENSIVE SCOPE AND SPIRIT WHICH TEN YEARS AGO WOULD HAVE BEEN DEEMED IMPOSSIBLE WHILE THAT GIVEN IN MANY OTHER INSTITU TIONS IS IF NOT SO COMPREHENSIVE AT LEAST AS THOROUGH AND VIGOROUS AS IN THE LARGER CENTRES IT IS A MOST HOPEFUL SIGN THAT MANY OF OUR BEST WORKERS IN THIS FIELD ARE IN SMALLER OR NEWER INSTITUTIONS SCATTERED FROMPROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADETMY 133 MAINE TO CALIFORNIA AND FROM MINNESOTA TO THE GULF WORKING OFTEN TIMES UNDER UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS BUT DOING THEIR SHARE TOWARD CULTI VATING THE COMMON FIELD AND INCREASING OUR STOCK OF SCIENTIFIC CAPITAL THE INCREASE IN PUBLIC INTEREST IS AMPLY EVIDENCED BY THE GROWING ATTENTION GIVEN TO SUCH PROBLEMS BY OUR DAILY OR WEEKLY PAPERS AND BY OUR LEADING MONTHLIES AND REVIEWS THE INTEREST IN THE SCIENTIFIC ASPECT OF THESE PROBLEMS IS ALSO PLAIN FROM THE GROWING STOCK OF TECH NICAL OR PROFESSIONAL LITERATURE WE HAVE ALREADY TWO HIGHCLASS REVIEWSTHE QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS AND THE POLITICAL SCI ENCE QUARTERLYPERIODICALS OF WHICH ANY COUNTRY MIGHT BE PROUD ONE PUBLISHED AT HARVARD AND THE OTHER AT COLUMBIA THE JOHNS HOP KINS SERIES OF STUDIES THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA SERIES ON POLIT ICAL ECONOMY AND PUBLIC LAW THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION SERIES THE AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL THE STATISTICAL ASSOCIA TION SERIESALL SUCCESSFUL PUBLICATIONS OF ESTABLISHED REPUTATIONSHOW HOW STRONG AND DEEP THESE SUBJECTS ARE STRIKING ROOT IN AMERICAN SOIL THE RECENT CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL SCIENCE BY AMER CAN WRITERS ARE NEITHER FEW NOR UNIMPORTANT AND THEY COVER EVERY PART OF THE FIELD WITH MORE OR LESS THOROUGHNESS THE TEXTBOOKS FOR ELE MENTARY INSTRUCTION BY ANDREWS ELY LAUGHLIN MCVANE AND WALKER THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ECONOMIC HISTORY BY TAUSSIG JENKS BOURNE AND OTHERS TOO NUMEROUS TO MENTION THE ESSAYS ON TRANSPORTATION BY HADLEY AND SELIGMAN THE WORK ON THEORETICAL ECONOMICS BY CLARK AND PATTEN THE WORK ON STATISTICS BY DEWEY SMITH AND WRIGHT THAT BY GOODNOW AND WILSON ON POLITICAL SCIENCE ARE SIMPLE SPECIMENS TAKEN AT RANDOM OF AMERICAN WORK WHICH HAVE COMMANDED NOT ONLY LOCAL BUT FOREIGN ATTENTION AS WELL ANOTHER AND NO LESS STRIKING INDICATION OF A GROWING SCIENTIFIC SPIRIT IS TO BE FOUND IN THE EFFORT TO SECURE SUCH CO6PERATION AMONG SCIENTIFIC WORKERS AS CAN ONLY BE OBTAINED BY THE ORGANIZATION OF SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS TO THOSE OF A NATIONAL SCOPE AND SPIRIT WHICH HAVE EXER CISED OR ARE EXERCISING A WIDE INFLUENCE BELONG THE AMERICAN SOCIAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION AND THE AMERICAN STATISTICAL ASSOCIATION THE LATTER HAVING BEEN RECENTLY REVIVED AND MADE EFFICIENT CHIEFLY THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF PROF DEWEY IT IS A SPECIAL SOCIETY WHOSE OBJECT IS SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED BY ITS TITLE THE FIRST TWO COVER A WIDE FIELD ONE OF THEM HAS A LONG AND BOTH OF THEM AN HONORABLE HISTORY IN SPITE OF THE VALUABLE WORK OF THESE ORGANIZATIONS IT WAS WIDELY FELT THAT THE SPIRIT OF SCIENTIFIC COIPERATION HAD NOT FOUND AN ADEQUATE EXPRESSION  THAT THERE WAS STILL ROOM FOR ANOTHER SOCIETY  THAT THERE WAS WORK OF A SPECIFIC KIND WHICH COULD NOT BE DONE BY ANY OF THE EXISTING ASSOCIATIONS AS A RESULT OF THIS FEELING A PRELIMINARY MEETING FOR ORGANIZATION WAS HELD IN PHILADELPHIA DECEMBER 14TH 1889 IN THE134 ANNALS OF THE

DIGEST OF THE PAPER SUBMITTED BY DR BOURINOT NO I ON POLITICS IN CANADA AND THE UNITED STATES IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWED PROFESSOR PATTERSON TOOK THE GROUND THAT THE SYSTEM OF MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY WHICH THE AUTHOR OF THE PAPER SEEMED TO APPROVE WAS UNSUITED TO OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERN MENT AND HAD NOT YET BEEN TRIED LONG ENOUGH IN ANY PURELY DEMOCRATIC COUNTRY TO ENABLE US TO FORM AN ULTIMATE OPINION IN REGARD TO ITS MERITS THERE ARE INDEED SOME INDICATIONS THAT IT IS BECOMING UNSATISFACTORY EVEN IN ENG LAND MR ROSENGARTEN THOUGHT THAT THE TEST OF MODERN GOVERN MENTS WAS COMING TO BE MORE AND MORE THEIR SUCCESS IN LOCAL MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AND HE WAS DESIROUS OF KNOW ING HOW THE CANADIAN SYSTEM WORKED IN THAT RESPECT COL THOMAS J DUDLEY DID NOT KNOW WHETHER THE SYSTEM OF MINISTERIAL RESPONSIBILITY WAS THE CAUSE OR NOT BUT HE WAS CONVINCED FROM A CAREFUL STUDY OF THE FACTSMADE POSSIBLE BY A LONG RESIDENCE ABROAD THAT THE CITIES OFPROCEEDINGS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 137 WESTERN EUROPE ARE VERY MUCH BETTER GOVERNED THAN OURS IN LIVERPOOL WHERE HE RESIDED FOR SEVERAL YEARS MALFEAS ANCE IN OFFICE WAS UNKNOWN MONEY APPROPRIATED FOR A GIVEN PURPOSE WAS EXPENDED FOR THAT PURPOSE AND PUBLIC WANTS WERE FAIRLY WELL LOOKED AFTER MR ROSENGARTEN READ A PAPER ON THE HOUSE OF REFUGE IN PHILADELPHIA PRINTED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO THE ANNALS JULY 1890 PROFESSOR E J JAMES READ A PAPER ON A NEW SYSTEM OF PASSENGER FARES PRINTED IN ABSTRACT AS AN INTRODUCTORY NOTE TO THE ARTICLE ON THE ZONETARIFF IN HUNGARY IN THE FIRST NUMBER OF THE ANNALS IN THE DISCUSSION WHICH FOLLOWED THIS PAPER THE QUESTION WAS RAISED BY MR ROSENGARTEN WHETHER THE OPERATING EX PENSES OF THE ROADS IN HUNGARY HAD INCREASED MORE OR LESS RAPIDLY THAN THE PASSENGER TRAFFIC UNDER THE NEW SYSTEM  THE OFFICIAL REPORT DID NOT SHOW THIS WAS THE ANSWER BUT WHEN ONE CONSIDERS THAT THE WAGONS RAN BEFORE THE INTRO DUCTION OF THE NEW SYSTEM WITH ONLY ABOUT 25 PER CENT OF THE SEATS OCCUPIED IT IS PLAIN THAT AN ENORMOUS INCREASE OF TRAFFIC MIGHT TAKE PLACE WITHOUT NECESSITATING ANY INCREASE OF CARS OR EMPLOYEES MORE PARTICULARLY AS THE NEW SYSTEM OF SELLING TICKETS MADE A SAVING IN TICKET AGENTS POSSIBLE THE QUESTION WAS ALSO RAISED WHETHER THE ROADS WERE STATE OR PRIVATE WORKS  THE ANSWER WAS THAT BOTH STATE AND PRIVATE ROADS ARE IN THE COMBINATION ACCEPTING THE NEW SYSTEM MR E P CHEYNEY SUGGESTED THAT THE TENDENCY TO TRAVEL FOR THE SAKE OF TRAVEL WAS NOT AN UNMITIGATED GOOD AND THAT AN UNDUE DEVELOPMENT OF PASSENGER TRAFFIC WAS NOT ON THE WHOLE DESIRABLE I THE NOTE IN THE ABSTRACT OF PROFESSOR JAMES ARTICLE ON P IO6 OF THE FIRST NUM BER OF THE ANNALS SHOWS THAT AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE WAS NO INCREASE OF OPERATING EXPENSES

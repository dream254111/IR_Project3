J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012797,IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES,I242625,IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES BY ALEXANDER E CANCE PHD DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURAL ECONOMICS MASSACHUSETTS AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE THE PROBLEM OF THE IMMIGRANT IS LARGELY INDUSTRIAL ITS ES SENCE LIES IN THE CONCENTRATION OF INCOMING FOREIGNERS IN URBAN AND INDUSTRIAL CENTERS IN THE COMPETITION FOR LABOR AND IN THE KEEPING DOWN OF THE WAGES OF LIVING AND THE STANDARD OF COMFORT OF THE ESTABLISHED WORKMAN THESE PROBLEMS AND A HOST OF OTHERS SO CIAL POLITICAL AND MORAL GROWING OUT OF THEIR CONGESTION POVERTY AND IGNORANCE OF THINGS AMERICAN HAVE UNTIL RECENTLY HAD LITTLE OR NO APPARENT SIGNIFICANCE IN THE RURAL DISTRICTS WHERE FOREIGNERS HAVE SETTLED NEVERTHELESS THE FOREIGNER HAS PLAYED A VERY PROMINENT PART IN THE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT NOT ONLY OF THE GREAT WEST AND SOUTHWEST BUT OF NEW ENGLAND THE LURE OF FREE LAND UN BROKEN RICH SUITED TO PIONEERS WILLING TO UNDERGO PRIVATIONS AND HARDSHIPS FOR THE SAKE OF LANDED PROPERTY ATTRACTED A STEADY STURDY INFLUX FROM NORTHERN AND WESTERN EUROPE WHICH CONTINUED THROUGH THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES BUT SLACKENED SOMEWHAT BY 1895 WHEN THE SUPPLY OF FREE LAND BEGAN TO BE PRETTY WELL EX HAUSTED IN THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY RURAL GROUPS OR SETTLE MENTS OF FOREIGNBORN ARE SO WIDESPREAD AND FREQUENT THAT A TOWN SHIP OF BOHEMIAN GERMAN OR SCANDINAVIAN FARMERS EXCITES NO COMMENT AND INVITES NO COMPARISONS THEY HAVE IMPROVED THE LAND ORGANIZED THE AGRICULTURE SHAPED THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND INFLUENCED THE POLITICAL SITUATION MOST OF THEM ARE VERY THOROUGHLY AMERICANIZEDAT ANY RATE THEY HAVE BECOME THOROUGHLY IMBUED WITH THE AMERICAN SPIRIT HAVE LOST MOST OF THEIR DISTINCTIVE RACE CHARACTERISTICS AND ARE WELL RECOGNIZED AND PERMANENTLY ESTABLISHED ELEMENTS INWESTERN RURAL LIFE MORE RECENTLY HOWEVER AND PERHAPS MORE ESPECIALLY IN THE EAST SOUTH SOUTHWEST AND PACIFIC COAST CERTAIN SMALL COMPACT COMMUNITIES OF FOREIGNERS HAVE BEEN SETTLING THEY BELONG TO THE NEWER IMMIGRATION ORIGINATING LARGELY IN SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEAST ERN EUROPE AND THEY REPRESENT WHAT MAY BE DENOMINATED THE 69THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AGRICULTURALLY DOUBTFUL RACES RACIALLY THEY ARE SLAVS ITALIANS HEBREWS PORTUGUESE A FEW GREEKS BELGIANS AND SOME ORIENTALS IT IS OF CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE RURAL FOLK THAT THIS PAPER WILL DEAL THE FEDERAL CENSUS OF I9OO REPORTED ABOUT NINE AND ONEHALF MILLION MALE BREADWINNERS ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURAL PURSUITS IN THE UNITED STATES THREEFIFTHS OF THESE WERE NATIVE WHITES BORN OF NATIVE PARENTS ABOUT ONESIXTH WERE NEGROES AND THE REMAINDER SOME 2I00000 WERE OF FOREIGN ORIGIN I E BORN OF FOREIGN PARENTS TAKING NO ACCOUNT OF THE CHINESE JAPANESE INDIANS AND OTHER COLORED PERSONS THE MALES OF FOREIGN LINEAGE CONSTITUTED IN I9OO MORE THAN ONEFOURTH 254 PER CENT OF ALL WHITE MALES IN AGRICULTURECERTAINLY AN ELEMENT TO BE RECKONED WITH VIEWED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF IMMIGRATION SOMETHING LIKE ONEFOURTH OF ALL MALE BREADWINNERS OF FOREIGN PARENTAGE IN THE UNITED STATES WERE ENGAGED IN AGRICULTURE IN I9OO THE OCCUPATIONAL STATISTICS OF THE CENSUS OF I9I0 HAVE NOT YET BEEN PUBLISHED BUT THEY WILL CERTAINLY SHOW AN INCREASING NUMBER OF RECENT IMMIGRAONTS ENTERING RURAL PURSUITS NEITHER THE ABSOLUTE NOR THE RELATIVE NUMBERS AT THE PRESENT TIME CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY THE UNITED STATES IMMIGRATION COMMISSION MADE A PARTIAL INVESTIGATION OF RECENT RURAL IMMIGRANTS FROM SOUTHERN EUROPE AND IN THE COURSE OF THEIR STUDY PERSONALLY VISITED MORE THAN I50 IMMIGRANT SETTLEMENTS REPRESENTING MANY DIFFERENT FORMS OF AGRI CULTURE IN NINETEEN STATES CHIEFLY ALONG THE ATLANTIC AND GULF COASTS WHERE MANY INCIPIENT COMMUNITIES HAVE RECENTLY TAKEN ROOT SEVERAL COLONIES ALSO LARGELY POLISH OR ITALIAN THAT HAVE RECENTLY ESTABLISHED THEMSELVES IN THE MIDDLE WEST WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDIES OF THE COMMISSION IN GENERAL THE GROUPS ARE RACIALLY HOMOGENEOUS MOREOVER AS RACES THEY BEAR CERTAIN COMMON CHARACTERISTICS OF SOME ECONOMIC SIGNIFICANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE ALTHOUGH A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM WERE BORN AND BRED IN RURAL DISTRICTS ABROAD COMPARATIVELY FEW OF THEM HAVE FOUND THEIR WAY TO THE COUNTRYSIDE IN THE UNITED STATES MOST OF THOSE WHO CHOSE AGRICULTURE AS A VOCATION BECAME FARMERS IMMEDIATELY ON THEIR ARRIVAL IN THE UNITED STATES SECOND AS COMPARED WITH THE RACES FROM NORTHERN EUROPE THESE FOREIGN ERS ARE RECENT ARRIVALS AND CONSEQUENTLY HAVE NOT GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE RICH VIRGIN LAND FREE MANY HAVE PURCHASED OLDER 70IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES MORE OR LESS IMPROVED AREAS OR THE LESS DESIRABLE PARCELS REJECTED BY EARLIER HOMESEEKERS THIRD THESE RACES ARE STILL ON TRIAL AS AGRICULTURISTS THEY HAVE NOT YET FULLY PROVED THEIR FITNESS FOR AMERICAN RURAL LIFE THEY ARE DOUBTFUL FINALLY WHILE AT PRESENT THE FARMERS AMONG THEM ARE RELATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER IT IS LIKELY THAT OUR AGRICULTURAL IMMIGRANTS OF THE FUTURE WILL BE LARGELY RE CRUITED FROM THE RANKS OF THESE RACES SEASONAL LABORERS AND PERMANENT FARMERS THE EARLY RURAL IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME FROM NORTHERN EUROPE AND MADE A STRAIGHT TRAIL FOR THE WOODLANDS AND PRAIRIES OF THE GREAT WEST YEARS AGO WERE ALMOST INVARIABLY HOMESEEKERS MOST OF THEM ENTERED UPON VIRGIN LAND AS SOON AS THEY REACHED THEIR DESTINATIONS OTHERS AFTER A VERY SHORT PERIOD AS FARM LABORERS AND LUMBERMEN INVESTED IN WAGONS AND TEAMS MARRIED AND BEGAN LIFE AS LAND OWNERS FROM THE BEGINNING THEY SECURED A FIRM FOOTHOLD ON THE SOIL TO WHICH THEY CLUNG TENACIOUSLY AMONG THE MORE RECENT AGRICULTURAL IMMIGRANTS ONE MAY DISTINGUISH THREE ECONOMIC CLASSES DIFFERENTIATED BY THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE LAND FIRST ARE THE SEASONAL LABORERS THOSE HAVING PLACES OF RESIDENCE AND PER HAPS A PRINCIPAL OCCUPATION IN THE CITY WHO SPEND A FEW WEEKS OF EACH YEAR IN THE AGRICULTURAL DISTRICTS PERFORMING CERTAIN SPECIFIC TASKS SUCH AS HOEING BERRYPICKING VEGETABLE GATHERING OR THE LIKE THE SECOND CLASS ARE THE REGULAR FARM LABORERS AS WE KNOW THEM WHO USUALLY BECOME LAND OWNERS THE THIRD ARE THE LAND BUYING FARM OWNING IMMIGRANTS THE SALT OF OUR FOREIGN FARMING COMMUNITIES WITH THE EXTENSION OF MARKET GARDENING SMALL FRUIT GROWING CRANBERRY BOGS ON A LARGE SCALE VEGETABLE CANNERIES AND SUGARBEET CULTIVATION THE DEMAND FOR SEASONAL LABOR HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE FIELD OF EMPLOYMENT IS FREQUENTLY NEAR CENTERS OF POPULATION SUMMER IS THE SEASON CONGENIAL TO THOSE WHO WOULD LIVE OUTOF DOORS ESPECIALLY FAVORABLE FOR THE EMPLOYMENT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN AND LABORERS OUT OF WORK BECAUSE SHOPS HAVE SHUT DOWN AND SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED IN GENERAL THE ENTIRE FAMILY MAY FIND EMPLOYMENT ON THE SAME FARM OR ENTERPRISE AND GREATLY REDUCE THE COST OF LIVING BY SUBSISTING ON VEGETABLES AND PAYING NO RENTS THOUSANDS OF ITALIANS GREEKS POLES PORTUGUESE AND OTHERS COME IN CONTACT WITH THE LAND AND WITH THE OPEN COUNTRY IN THIS WAY 7ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE SEASONAL LABORER HAS LITTLE OPPORTUNITY TO BECOME AN OWNER HE IS THE COUNTERPART OF THE UNSKILLED TEMPORARY LABORER IN INDUSTRY THE DAY LABORER ON RAILWAY CONSTRUCTION WORK SPECIALIZED CAPI TALISTIC LARGE SCALE AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION DEMANDS EFFICIENT MA CHINES AND OFTEN GREAT GANGS OF COMPARATIVELY CHEAP LABORERS THE CRANBERRY INDUSTRY HIGHLY PROFITABLE WHEN RIGHTLY MANAGED IS ABSO LUTELY DEPENDENT ON AN ARMY OF PICKERS USUALLY ITALIANS PORTU GUESE POLES OR INDIANS WHO CAN BE EMPLOYED FOR A SHORT TIME DURING THE HARVESTING SEASON MANY OF THESE LABORERS ARE ALIENS LABORERS OF THE POOREST SORT WITH LITTLE AMBITION AND FEW AMERICAN IDEALS THEY ARE FREQUENTLY BIRDS OF PASSAGE CARING NAUGHT FOR AGRICULTURE NOR RURAL LIFE NOR AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP THEY SERVE ONLY TO MAKE AGRICULTURE PROFITABLE TO THE ENTERPRISER BETWEEN THEM AND LAND PROPRIETORSHIP THERE IS A GREAT GULF FIXED ACROSS WHICH VERY FEW ARE ABLE TO PASS CAREFUL INQUIRY DISCLOSES THAT VERY FEW SEASONAL FARM LABORERS FIND ENCOURAGEMENT TO BECOME OWNERS OF FARMS THIS CLASS OF RURAL IMMIGRANTS IS THE LEAST SATIS FACTORY FROM ANY POINT OF VIEW ECONOMIC SOCIAL POLITICAL OR MORAL THE IMMIGRANT FARM HAND THE REGULAR FARM LABORER EMPLOYED BY THE YEAR OR THE MONTH GETS SOMEWHAT MORE CLOSELY IN TOUCH WITH THE SOIL AND WITH AMERICAN IDEALS THOUSANDS OF NEWCOMERS FRESH FROM THEIR NATIVE SHORES HAVE ENGAGED IN AND ARE FINDING EMPLOYMENT ON IMMIGRANT AND AMERICAN FARMS LEARNING THE RUDI MENTS OF AMERICAN FARMING ACQUIRING AMERICAN METHODS GETTING A GRIP ON THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE AND SAVING AMERICAN DOLLARS TO PURCHASE AMERICAN LAND THE FARM LABORERS OF NEW YORK AND NEW ENGLAND SEEM TO BE CHIEFLY POLES ITALIANS PORTUGUESE CANA DIAN FRENCH AND A FEW OTHER FOREIGNBORN THEY ARE SELDOM WHOLLY SATISFACTORY FARM LABORERS BUT THERE IS NO OTHER REALLY AVAILA BLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY A SURPRISINGLY LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THEM COME TO LOVE THE SOIL AND IN A FEW YEARS ACQUIRE SOME LAND PURCHASED OUT OF THEIR EARNINGS THIS IS MARKEDLY THE CASE WHERE THE FARM LABORERS ARE NEWCOMERS OF THE SAME RACE AS THEIR EMPLOYERS PERMANENT RURAL GROUPS OF THE SOMEWHAT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY RURAL COM MUNITIES VISITED BY AGENTS OF THE IMMIGRATION COMMISSION MORE THAN FORTY WERE ITALIAN SETTLEMENTS THE LARGEST OLDEST AND MOST IMPORTANT OF THESE IN THE EAST ARE ESTABLISHED ON THE SANDY PINE 72IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES BARRENS OF SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY HERE PERHAPS SEVEN THOUSAND PERSONS OF FOREIGN LINEAGE HAVE FOUND PERMANENT HOMES THE FOR BIDDING NATURE OF THE INFERTILE WASTE OF SAND SWAMP AND WOODLAND WHICH CHARACTERIZES THE NEW JERSEY BARRENS HAS PREVENTED THEIR OCCUPATION AND IMPROVEMENT BY AMERICANS HERE AND THERE A FEW POOR NATIVE FARMERS HAVE CLEARED SMALL AREAS AND CARRY ON AN INFERIOR SORT OF AGRICULTURE EKING OUT THEIR INCOMES BY THE SALE OF WOOD OR LOWGRADE TIMBER THREE DECADES OR MORE AGO IT WAS DIS COVERED THAT SMALL FRUITS AND BERRIES COULD BE PRODUCED PROFITABLY ON NEWLY CLEARED VIRGIN LAND A FEW ITALIANS WERE INDUCED TO SETTLE OTHERS CAME TO PICK BERRIES AND BECAUSE LAND WAS CHEAP REMAINED TO RAISE THEM STILL OTHERS GATHERED ABOUT THE FIRST NUCLEI AT HAM MONTON AND VINELAND PURCHASED SMALL FARMS CLEARED THEM AND RAISED QUANTITIES OF EXCELLENT BERRIES AND GRAPES OVER A LIMITED AREA THEY HAVE LITERALLY TURNED A DESERT INTO A GARDEN THEIR SMALL HOLDINGS OF FIVE TO THIRTYFIVE ACRES ARE WELL CULTIVATED PLANTED TO PEACHES GRAPES STRAWBERRIES RASPBERRIES BLACKBERRIES AND SWEET POTATOES AND PRESENT A LIVELY ILLUSTRATION OF SMALL FARMING WITH A SPECIALIZED MONEY CROP ON THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD ABOUT TWO DECADES AGO BERRYGROWING WAS VERY PROFITABLE IN SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY PROVIDED ONE WAS ABLE TO PROCURE A SUPPLY OF CHEAP LABOR THE ITALIAN WAS ABLE TO COMPETE FOR BERRY LAND BECAUSE OF HIS LARGE FAMILY WILLING AND ABLE TO AID HIM FROM CLEARING TO HAR VEST BECAUSE OF HIS LOW STANDARD OF COMFORT AND HIS CAPACITY FOR INCESSANT MANUAL TOIL MOREOVER SEVERAL SHOPS AND FACTORIES GAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR IMMEDIATE EARNINGS A FACT OF CONSIDERABLE IM PORTANCE WHERE LAND IS UNCLEARED AND NOT IMMEDIATELY PRODUCTIVE WHEN THE LAND WAS NEW AND PROFITS EASY A GOOD MANY AMERICANS RAISED BERRIES IN COMPETITION WITH THE ITALIANS MORE RECENTLY HOWEVER SUCCESSFUL BERRYGROWING HAS DEPENDED LARGELY ON CAREFUL TILLAGE HAND CULTURE AND FERTILIZATION AND MANY OF THE AMERICANS HAVE SOLD OUT TO ITALIANS ALLEGING THEIR INABILITY TO COMPETE WITH THEM SUCCESSFULLY IN THESE COMMUNITIES BOTH NORTH ITALIANS AND SICILIANS ARE REP RESENTED AND BOTH HAVE MADE EFFICIENT FARMERS AND RESPONSIBLE CITIZENS THE COMMUNITY IS STILL IN THE MAKING HERE ARE THE RECENT ARRIVALS FOREIGN IN DRESS SPEECH AND CONDUCT THEY HAVE SETTLED ON SMALL PARCELS OF LAND AND ARE DEEPLY IN DEBT THE MEN WORK IN THE BRICKYARDS THE GLASS WORKS OR AS COMMON DAY LABORERS WHILE 73THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WIFE AND CHILDREN CARE FOR THE BERRY PATCH LIVING IN THE BETTER HOUSES ON THE LARGER HOLDINGS ARE THE OLDER IMMIGRANTS THEY HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE LONG HARD DAYS OF DEBT AND PIONEERING HAVE IMPROVED THEIR HOLDINGS AND PURCHASED MORE LAND HAVE BUILT GOOD HOUSES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS RESPECTED MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY PERHAPS AMERICAN CITIZENS THERE IS STILL ANOTHER CLASS THE AMERICANBORN ITALIAN RAISED ON AMERICAN SOIL FAMILIAR WITH BERRY FARMING FROM CHILDHOOD MANY OF THEM ALERT ACTIVE INTELLIGENT PROGRESSIVE THEY ARE THE CHOICE FRUITS OF AMERICAN IMMIGRANT RURAL LIFE UP TO THE PRESENT THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN MANIFEST AN INCLINATION TO REMAIN FARMERS THEY TAKE AN ACTIVE INTEREST IN COMMUNITY LIFE AND THE BUSINESS OF AGRICULTURE THEY ARE FAIRLY PROSPEROUS THEIR EDUCA TIONAL SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC STANDARDS ARE HIGHER THAN THEIR PARENTS THEY ARE GOOD CITIZENS AND TRUSTWORTHY AND MANY OF THEM ARE PROUD OF THEIR PROFESSION THE BASIS OF A WHOLESOME HAPPY RURAL LIFE IS ECONOMIC PROS PERITY WHERE THE RETURNS FROM AGRICULTURE ARE INADEQUATE IT IS FRUITLESS TO LOOK FOR ADEQUATE SOCIAL RECREATIVE OR EDUCATIONAL IN STITUTIONS AND ENTERPRISES EXCEPT IN RARE INSTANCES THIS TRUTH IS ESPECIALLY DEMONSTRABLE IN SLAVIC OR ITALIAN COMMUNITIES THAT THE NEW JERSEY GROUPS HAVE ESTABLISHED A FAIRLY SATISFACTORY SYS TEM OF PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO WHICH THEY SEND THEIR CHILDREN WITH SOME REGULARITY IS RATHER GOOD EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN PROSPEROUS AND SUCCESSFUL FARMERS THE VINELAND COLONY WITH ITS MILES OF COUNTRY ROADS OR STREETS BEARING ITALIAN NAMES AND THICKLY LINED WITH THE HOMES OF SMALL FARMERS ITS ITALIAN HOLIDAYS AND CELEBRATIONS ITS CHURCHES THRONGED WITH FOREIGN WORSHIPPERS AND ITS SCHOOLS FILLED EXCLUSIVELY WITH PUPILS OF ITALIAN ORIGIN IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF A LARGE ISOLATED RACIALLY HOMOGENEOUS IMMIGRANT RURAL GROUP THE RURAL ISOLATION HAS TENDED TO PERPETUATE OLD COUNTRY TRADITIONS CUSTOMS AND LANGUAGE AMERICANIZATION HAS PROCEEDED SLOWLY AND THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE FUSION OR AMALGAMATION EITHER WITH NATIVES OR OTHER RACE ELEMENTS THE ADULT IMMIGRANTS LEARN ENGLISH MUCH MORE SLOWLY THAN IN CITIES OR IN RURAL PLACES WHERE THERE IS LESS SEGREGA TION BY RACE AND RELIGION THE PARISH PRIESTS USE ITALIAN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY ITALIAN IS SPOKEN IN THE HOME THE FIELDS AT THE SOCIAL GATHERINGS AND TO SOME EXTENT IN THE SCHOOL YARD CONSIDERING 74IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES THESE FACTS THE PROGRESS MADE BY THE NORTH ITALIANS ESPECIALLY IN AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP AND IDEALS IS REMARKABLE WHILE THE SETTLEMENT OF FOREIGNERS IN LARGE COMPACT GROUPS HAS SOME ADVANTAGES CHIEFLY TO FACILITATE THE FOUNDING OF A COLONY IT IS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER THE INCORPORATION OF THESE LARGE UNAS SIMILABLE ALIEN LUMPS INTO THE RURAL BODY POLITIC IS EXPEDIENT IN THE LONG RUN IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT THE PROGRESSIVE INHABITANT COME INTO TOUCH WITH THE CURRENTS OF AMERICAN THOUGHT AMERICAN METHODS AND AMERICAN LIFE AS RAPIDLY AS POSSIBLE IN ONE OR TWO SECTIONS WHERE THE IMMIGRANTS HAVE PURCHASED HOMES IN DISTRICTS SETTLED BY NATIVE FARMERS AND HAVE FOUND THEMSELVES SO TO SPEAK SANDWICHED IN BETWEEN AMERICAN LANDOWNERS PROGRESS IN AMALGAMATION HAS BEEN MUCH MORE RAPID ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL DIFFICULTIES WERE GREATER FOR THE FOREIGNER THE ITALIAN RURAL SETTLERS BOTH IN NEW YORK NEW ENGLAND AND THE SOUTHERN STATES ARE VERY LARGELY SMALL FARMERS ENGAGED IN TRUCK GROWING MARKET GARDENING BERRY CULTURE OR COTTON RAISING IN GENERAL THEY ARE OWNERS OF SMALL HOLDINGS THOUGH THE FORM OF LAND TENURE IS REALLY A MATTER OF THE CUSTOM OF THE LOCALITY FOR EXAMPLE IMMIGRANT COTTON GROWERS ARE CHIEFLY TENANTS WHO OFFER THE HIGHEST COMPETITIVE RENTS FOR THE LAND THEY WISH IN CONTRAST THEIR SICILIAN BLOOD RELATIVES WHO MOVED FROM THE COTTON DISTRICTS TO THE HILLS OF ARKANSAS ARE ALL OWNERS OF THE LAND THEY OPERATE THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF POLISH FARMERS WHO ARE PERHAPS AMONG THE MOST EAGER OF THE HOME BUILDERS THE GREAT MAJORITY OWN THEIR FARMS BUT IN TEXAS AMONG THE COTTON GROWERS IN THE OLD SETTLEMENTS OF ILLINOIS AND WISCONSIN WHERE LAND IS HIGH AND NECES SARY EQUIPMENT EXPENSIVE AND AMONG THE RECENT SLAVIC ONION AND TOBACCO GROWERS OF THE CONNECTICUT VALLEY TENANTS ARE VERY FRE QUENT IMMIGRANTS OF ALL RACES ARE PROFOUNDLY AFFECTED BY THEIR ENVIRONMENT BY THE ECONOMIC EXIGENCIES OF THE SITUATION NOR ARE THE ITALIANS SMALL FARMERS ONLY ALTHOUGH ALL THEIR OLD COUNTRY KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING INCLINES THIEM TO PETITE CULTURE ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL SMALL COLONIES OF ITALIANS IS LOCATED IN WESTERN WISCONSIN WHERE DAIRYING CATTLE RAISING AND CEREAL CROPS ARE THE CHIEF AGRICULTURAL SUBINDUSTRIES LARGE HERDS OF CATTLE NUMEROUS HORSES MODERN HORSEPOWER MACHINERY THEY HANDLE AS EASILY AND EFFECTIVELY AS THEIR NEIGHBORS IMMIGRANTS FROM GER MANY AND SCANDINAVIA IN WHATEVER LINE OF FARMING THE ITALIANS 75THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY EITHER NORTH OR SOUTH HAVE SERIOUSLY ENGAGED THEY HAVE DEMON STRATED THEIR ADAPTABILITY AND EFFICIENCY FREQUENTLY GREATER EFFICIENCY THAN THEIR NEIGHBORS OR PREDECESSORS WHETHER RAISING FRUIT ON THE STONY UPLANDS OF CONNECTICUT OR THE SANDY WASTES OF NEW JERSEY GROWING COTTON ON THE BLACK LAND OF THE BRAZOS BOTTOMS OR VEGETA BLES ON THE BLACK MUCK OF WESTERN NEW YORK CULTIVATING STRAW BERRIES ON THE GULF COASTAL PLAIN OR POTATOES IN THE CUTOVER REGION OF NORTHERN WISCONSIN IRRESPECTIVE OF CLIMATE SOIL TOPOGRAPHY OR PRODUCTS OF AGRICULTURE THE ITALIAN IMMIGRANT ON THE LAND HAS MADE GOOD AS A PRODUCER AND WHERE HE HAS BEEN GIVEN AID AND ENCOURAGEMENT HE HAS PROVED A RESPECTABLE CITIZEN POLISH FARMERS THE POLES ARE A BETTER KNOWN AND PERHAPS A MORE IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN RURAL IMMIGRATION THE FIRST CURRENT OF POLISH IMMI GRANTS SET IN FROM POLAND TO NORTHERN ILLINOIS WISCONSIN AND IOWA DURING THE 6OS AND 70S THE INITIAL POLISH IMMIGRANTS WERE A SUPERIOR SORT MORE OR LESS INDEPENDENT ABROAD THEY CAME TO AMERICA TO TAKE UP THE NEW FREE LAND AND BUILD HOMES FOR THEM SELVES AFTER 1885 WHEN NUMEROUS POLISH COMMUNITIES HAD BEEN PLANTED HERE AND THERE OVER THE LAKE STATES AND THE WESTERN PRAI RIES THE CHARACTER OF THE IMMIGRANTS BEGAN TO CHANGE A SMALLER PERCENTAGE ARE PEASANTS OR INDEPENDENT PROPRIETORS MORE HAVE BEEN DAY LABORERS ABROAD AND IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED IN MINES QUARRIES STEEL MILLS AND OTHER INDUSTRIAL PUR SUITS THEY HAVE BEEN ATTRACTED TO THE LAND BY ADVERTISEMENTS IN POLISH NEWSPAPERS OR THE SOLICITATION OF POLISH LAND AGENTS THEY REPRESENT INDUCED IMMIGRATION THEY SETTLE IN SMALL GROUPS THEIR CHOICE OF LOCATION IS INFLUENCED OR DIRECTED BY OUTSIDE PERSONS HAVING MORE READY MONEY THAN THEIR PREDECESSORS THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PURCHASE MORE OF THE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT ESSENTIAL TO MODERN FARMING THESE POLISH SETTLERS HAVE PROVED PROMISING PIONEERS AND HAVE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF PROSPEROUS COMMUNITIES ON THE CUTOVER TIMBER LANDS OF NORTHERN WISCONSIN THE LESS DESIRA BLE PRAIRIES OF THE DAKOTAS AND THE UNPRODUCTIVE LAND OF ILLINOIS AND INDIANA CHIEFLY BECAUSE THESE LANDS COULD BE BOUGHT CHEAPLY THE SETTLEMENT OF POLES ON THE SOCALLED ABANDONED FARMS OF THE EAST HAS NOT ASSUMED SIGNIFICANT PROPORTIONS NOR IS IT AT ALL PROBABLE THAT THE MORE ISOLATED HILL TOWNS OF NEW ENGLAND FOR 76IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES EXAMPLE WILL BE POPULATED BY DESIRABLE ALIEN FARMERS FOR MANY YEARS TO COME UNTIL SOME MONEY CROP HAS BEEN FOUND PECULIARLY ADAPTED TO THE ROUGH STONY SOILS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE NEWCOMER CAN SUSTAIN HIMSELF UNTIL HIS DEPLETED ACRES BEGIN TO PRODUCE ABUNDANTLY THE AMBITIOUS SLAV IS NOT LIKELY TO TAKE KINDLY TO COLONIZATION ON EXHAUSTED AREAS THE FORMER OCCUPANTS OF THE OLD EASTERN FARMS PRACTICED A FORM OF AGRICULTURE THAT FOR YEARS PROVED UNECONOMIC AND EVENTUALLY GAVE UP THE UNDERTAKING THE NEW ARRIVAL FACES A WORNOUT SOIL AN OBSOLETE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM THE NECESSITY FOR THE REORGANIZATION OF CROPS AND FARM PRACTICE WITH NO RESOURCES SAVE HIS CHARACTERISTIC CAPACITY FOR HARD WORK AND USUALLY A LARGE AND WILLING SUPPLY OF LABOR IN HIS FAMILY HE NEEDS KNOWLEDGE AND CURRENT CAPITAL AND A LONG PERIOD OF WAITING MEAN TIME HE FINDS IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO WIN A SUBSISTENCE AND ACCUMU LATE ANY SAVINGS BUT ON THE MORE FERTILE AREAS WHERE HIGHPRICED LAND DEVOTED TO A SPECIALIZED MONEY CROP LARGELY DEPENDENT ON MANUAL LABOR FOR ITS SUCCESSFUL CULTIVATION IS CHARACTERISTIC POLISH IMMIGRANTS AND PORTUGUESE AND HEBREWS AS WELL HAVE FOUND AGRICULTURE A PROFITA BLE OCCUPATION IN THE CONNECTICUT VALLEY INTO WHICH THEY FIRST ENTERED AS FARM HANDS ABOUT I89O THEY ARE TAKING POSSESSION OF THE FERTILE ONION AND TOBACCO LANDS WITH INCREASING RAPIDITY BOTH AS TENANTS AND AS OWNERS IN CERTAIN TOWNS SOME OF THE VERY CHOICEST OF THE OLD NEW ENGLAND FARM HOMES HAVE PASSED INTO THE OWNERSHIP OF POLES THEIR LARGE FAMILIES AND THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK LONG HOURS ENABLE THEM TO OUT COMPETE THE AMERICAN ONION AND TOBACCO GROWERS THEY ARE ABLE TO OFFER PRICES FOR LAND THAT THE AMERICAN OWNER CANNOT AFFORD TO REFUSE THEIR NATURAL IN CREASE IS STEADILY OVERWHELMING THE DECAYING NATIVE POPULATION THERE IS SCARCELY A SHADOW OF DOUBT THAT THE FOREIGN INFLUX WILL TAKE COMPLETE AND PERMANENT POSSESSION OF MANY RICH RURAL TOWNS WHERE AGRICULTURE IS A PROFITABLE UNDERTAKING WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF THE POLES IN WESTERN MASSACHUSETTS MAY BE SAID OF THE FOREIGNERS ON THE MUCK LANDS IN WEST CENTRAL NEW YORK OF THE PORTUGUESE IN THE TOWN OF PORTSMOUTH RHODE ISLAND OF HEBREWS AND GERMANSWISS IN THE VALLEY OF WESTERN CONNECTICUT AND IN CERTAIN LOCALITIES IN MAINE WHERE FINNS AND SWEDES HAVE FORMED COLONIES THE TALE IS EVER THE SAME GIVEN A PRODUCT THAT WILL RETURN MONEY IN EXCHANGE FOR MANUAL LABOR 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND CHEAP LIVING HARD WORK LARGE FAMILIES LONG HOURS AND LITTLE LEISURE WILL INEVITABLY WIN IN THE COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC CONTEST WITHIN A DECADE WE MAY LOOK TO SEE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF IMMI GRANT GROUPS OCCUPYING THE PICK OF THE SOILS OF NEW YORK AND NEW ENGLAND COOPERATIVE ADAPTABILITY AMONG THE ITALIANS AND TO SOME EXTENT AMONG THE POLES AND PORTUGUESE SPECIALIZATION OF PRODUCTS BY LOCALITIES IS A NOTEWORTHY ECONOMIC FEATURE OF THEIR AGRICULTURE PRACTICALLY EVERY FARMER IN THE COMMUNITY IS ENGAGED IN RAISING THE SAME PRINCIPAL PRODUCT INSTEAD OF COMPETITION THIS RESULTS IN EFFICIENT RIVALRY COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR AND HIGHLY SPECIALIZED PRODUCTION STRAWBERRIES BLACK BERRIES SWEET AND IRISH POTATOES TOBACCO AND CERTAIN TRUCK CROPS AND ORCHARD FRUITS WERE FOUND OCCUPYING THE ENTIRE ATTENTION OF FARMERS IN AS MANY DIFFERENT LOCALITIES IN COOPERATIVE UNDERTAKINGS THE FOREIGNERS HAVE A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE OVER THE NATIVE FARMERS BECAUSE OF THEIR RACIAL HOMO GENEITY IF CLASS CONSCIOUSNESS HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY DEVELOPED THERE IS AT ANY RATE A RACE CONSCIOUSNESS WHICH FORMS A GROUNDWORK FOR COMMUNITY SPIRIT AND COMMERCIAL COOPERATIVE ENDEAVOR AT INDEPENDENCE LOUISIANA FOR EXAMPLE WHERE THE MARKETING SITUA TION DEMANDED A UNITED INTEREST THE SICILIAN STRAWBERRY GROWERS CAME TOGETHER WITH COMMENDABLE FACILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS TO MAR KET THEIR BERRIES AND TO PURCHASE FERTILIZERS AND BERRY BOXES IN SEVERAL OF THE MORE NORTHERN COLONIES THE ITALIANS EXHIBIT APTNESS IN COOPERATING AND UNITE VERY SUCCESSFULLY TO SELL PRODUCE TO PUR CHASE SUPPLIES AND EQUIPMENT AND TO MANUFACTURE THEIR SURPLUS RAW MATERIALS OF AGRICULTURE IN ESTABLISHING LOCAL COOPERATIVE BUSINESS ENTERPRISES THE IMMIGRANTS ARE MUCH MORE UNIFORMLY SUCCESSFUL THAN THEIR NATIVE WHITE NEIGHBORS AMERICANIZATION AND ASSIMILATION IT IS REMARKABLE THAT COMPARATIVELY FEW POLISH FARMERS IN NEW ENGLAND ARE RECRUITED FROM THE INDUSTRIAL CENTERS THE POLE COMES TO THE LAND DIRECTLY FROM HIS HOME ABROAD IF HE HAS NOT MONEY TO RENT OR PURCHASE HE BEGINS AS A FARM HAND AND IN A VERY FEW YEARS GRADUATES AS AN OWNER OF THE FARM COMING FROM ABROAD THE GREATER NUMBER HAVE LITTLE OR NO KNOWLEDGE OF ENGLISH AND NONE OF AMERICAN CIVIC IDEALS OR COMMUNITY LIFE FOR THIS 78IMMIGRANT RURAL COMMUNITIES REASON SOME THOUGHTFUL PEOPLE HAVE GREATLY REGRETTED THE INFLOW OF IMMIGRANTS TO RURAL NEW ENGLAND THIS MOVEMENT IS HOWEVER ECONOMICALLY INEVITABLE UNDER PRESENT CONDITIONS AND WHILE SLAVIC FARMERS ARE LESS SATISFACTORY THAN NEW ENGLANDERS THEY ARE BETTER THAN NO FARMERS AT ALL MOREOVER THE PROSPEROUS CONDITION OF THEIR AGRICULTURE MATERIALLY HASTENS THEIR AMERICANIZATION NEW ENGLAND IS BEGINNING TO RECOG NIZE AND MAKE PROVISION FOR THEIR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS AND NIGHT SCHOOLS LIBRARY FACILITIES AND INSTRUCTION IN CIVICS AND MORALS ARE BEING PLACED AT THE DISPOSAL OF THE RURAL FOREIGNBORN GROUPS IN GENERAL ALL FOREIGN RURAL COMMUNITIES IN THE EAST PARTICU LARLY HEBREW FARM COLONIES WHERE NOT VERY LARGE NOR CLOSELY SEGREGATED MANIFEST A LIVELY DESIRE TO SPEAK AND READ ENGLISH TO ADOPT AMERICAN DRESS CUSTOMS AND METHODS OF FARM PRACTICE AND WHERE ENCOURAGED TO SEEK NATURALIZATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT ASSIMILATION AND AMERICANIZATION TAKE PLACE MORE RAPIDLY AMONG THE LESS SEGREGATED RURAL IMMIGRANTS THAN IN CONGESTED INDUSTRIAL GROUPS IN URBAN LOCALITIES LAND OWNERSHIP CONFERS DIGNITY IMPOSES FINANCIAL AND SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY STIMU LATES ACTIVITY IN CIVIC AFFAIRS AND AWAKENS COMMUNITY INTEREST AND PERSONAL PRIDE IN SHORT SO FAR AS THE IMMIGRANT IS CONCERNED RURAL LIFE IN MOST INSTANCES HAS HAD A MOST SALUTARY EFFECT IT HAS FREQUENTLY TAKEN AN IGNORANT ABJECT UNSKILLED DEPENDENT FOREIGN LABORER AND MADE OF HIM A SHREWD SELFRESPECTING INDEPENDENT FARMER AND CITIZEN HIS RETURNS IN MATERIAL WELFARE ARE NOT GREAT BUT HE LIVES HAPPILY COMFORTABLY AND PEACEABLY AND IN TIME ACCUMU LATES A SMALL PROPERTY THE SECOND GENERATION OF THESE SOUTH EUROPEAN IMMIGRANTS ARE FREQUENTLY NOT LESS PROGRESSIVE THAN THE AMERICANS LEADERSHIP ONE INFLUENTIAL FACTOR IN THE SOCIAL AND CIVIC PROGRESS OF THE RURAL GROUP IS THE QUALITY OF ITS LEADERSHIP IN THE SOUTHERN COLO NIES SITUATED IN STATES WITH INADEQUATE RURAL SCHOOLS AND NON COMPULSORY ATTENDANCE LAWS WHERE THERE IS LITTLE INCENTIVE TO LOCAL POLITICAL ACTIVITY WHERE TENANT NEIGHBORS TAKE LITTLE INTEREST IN CITI ZENSHIP OR COMMUNITY AFFAIRS THE LACK OF STRONG LEADERSHIP IS VERY NOTICEABLE FEW HAVE QUALIFIED AS VOTERS AND THE PERCENTAGE OF ILLITERACY IS RELATIVELY HIGH CERTAIN SOUTHERN COLONIES HOWEVER 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE IN POSSESSING STRONG AND WISE LEADERS AMERICAN OR FOREIGN WHO HAVE INSISTED ON EDUCATIONAL FACILITIES AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS HAVE URGED EARLY NATURALIZATION AND ENCOURAGED PAR TICIPATION IN PUBLIC AFFAIRS AND HAVE MADE PLAIN THE WAY TO AMERI CANIZATION AND HIGHER STANDARDS OF LIVING TO THESE OPPORTUNITIES THE FOREIGNERS RESPOND PROMPTLY AND EAGERLY BETWEEN THE ITALIAN COTTON TENANTS OF THE MISSISSIPPI DELTA REGION AMONG WHOM ARE FEW CITIZENS NUMEROUS ILLITERATES FEW CHILDREN IN SCHOOL VERY MEAGRE COMMUNITY INSTITUTIONS AND NO POLITICAL INTEREST AND THEIR KINSMEN IN UPLAND ARKANSAS WITH A MAJORITY OF NATURALIZED CITIZENS A MOST LIVELY PARTICIPATION IN PUB LIC MATTERS EXCEPTIONALLY FINE EDUCATIONAL AND RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS LITTLE ILLITERACY AND A RAPIDLY RISING STANDARD OF COMFORT THE CONTRAST IS MOST STRIKING THE SOCIAL SUPERIORITY OF THE UPLAND ARKANSAS COLONY IS DUE LARGELY TO EFFICIENT LEADERSHIP AND INDIVIDUAL OWNER SHIP OF LAND OTHER INSTANCES MIGHT BE CITED TO DEMONSTRATE THE VERY SIGNIFICANT TRUTH THAT PROGRESS IS MUCH MORE RAPID AND SATIS FACTORY WHERE THERE IS SOME ONE TO LEND A FRIENDLY HAND FROM THE BEGINNING 80

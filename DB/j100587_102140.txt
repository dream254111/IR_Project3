MISSIONNAIRE RECOLLET C A PARIS 1683 80 THE VOYAGE WHICH IS HERE DESCRIBED WAS BEGUN UNDER THE CONDUCT OF MONSIEUR DE LA SALLE AT THE LATTER END OF THE YEAR 1678 FROM THE FORT OF FRONTENAC IN ABOUT 45 DEGREES NORTH LATITUDE BEING THE MOST WESTERLY PLANTATION OF THE FRENCH IN THE RIVER OF ST LAWRENCE IT WAS CONTINUED BEHIND MOST OF THE TER RITORYS OF THE KING OF ENGLAND UPON THE CONTINENT OF AMERICA FIRST THRO THE LAKE OF FRONTENAC OR ONTORIO BEING 80 LEAGUES LONG AND 25 OR 30 LEAGUES BROAD NEXT THRO THE LAKE OF CONTY OR ERIE THEN THRO THE LAKE OF ORTENEY OR DES HURONS LASTLY THRO THE LAKE DAUPHIN OR ISLINOIS THESE 3 LAST LAKES ARE NEER OF AN EQUALL COM PASS BEING ABOUT 120 OR 130 LEAGUES LONG AND 40 OR 50 LEAGUES BROAD AT THE FURTHER END OF THE LAKE DAU PHIN IN ABOUT 37 OF LATITUDE THE VOYAGERS WENT UP A RIVER SOUTH TILL THEY CAME TO A CERTAIN PASSE OF ABOUT A LEAGUE AND A  OVER LAND LEADING TO THE RIVER ISLINOIS OR SEGNELAY WHICH AFTER ABOUT 200 LEAGUES FALLS INTO THE RIVER MECHACIPY OR COLBERT AND THAT AFTER ABOUT 120 OR 130 LEAGUES MORE RUNS INTO THE BAY OF MEXICO THESE LAST 130 LEAGUES ARE TAKEN FROM THE RELATIONS OF OTHERS AND WERE NOT TRAVELLED BY OUR AUTHOR BUT IN STEAD OF THAT HE MAKES YOU AMENDS WITH 500 LEAGUES ROWED UP THE RIVER MECHACIPYIN A CANOTOR BRARKAGAINST THE STREAM WHAT AUTHORITY THERE IS FOR THESE LAST NUM BERS I CANT WELL SEE FOR IF THE LENGTH OF THE WAY BE IN CREDIBLE YOU ARE LIKE TO FIND NO CIRCUMSTANCES TO HELP YOU TO CORRECT THEM WHETHER THE DESIGN OF THE AUTHOR WERE TO TAKE POSSESSION OF A GREAT CONTINENT OR ONLY TO CONVERT981 THE COUNTRY WHEN HE UNDERSTANDS THE LANGUAGES IS NOT PLAIN FOR HE OUGHT RATHER TO HAVE GON DOWN THE RIVER COLBERT IF HE ONLY SOUGHT A MORE COMMODIOUS PASSAGE FOR SKINS INTO EUROPE THEN THAT THRO THE BAY OF CANADA WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS BEING IN SOME PLACES TOO RAPID IN OTHERS HAVING FALLS OR CATARACTS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OF WHICH CALLED THE SAULT DE NIAGARA IS NEER 500 FOOT PER PENDICULAR THE MOUTH OF THE RIVER SEIGNELAY IS IN ABOUT 36 AND  OF LATITUDE THE RIVER COLBERT THERE ABOUT IS A LEAGUE BROAD AND IN SOME PLACES TWO THE COUNTRYS ISLINOIS AND LUISIANE ARE DESCRIBED TO HAVE LARGE MEADOWS PLENTY OF TREES FOR BUILDING OF SHIPS VINES AND HEMP GROWING NATURALLY AND ALSO TO YIELD PLUMS CHERRYS CITRONS APPLES PEARS VVAL NUTS SMALL NUTS GOOSBERRYS INDIAN AND OTHER WHEAT TURNEPS MELONS PUMPKINS CABBAGE

MINES OF COAL SLATE AND IRON SMALL PIECES OF PURE COPPERA FOUNTAIN OF SALT AND ALLUM AND DOUBTLESS OTHER THINGS NOT DISCOVERABLE BY SO SLIGHT A SURVEY AN ESSAY982 AN ESSAY OF THE GREAT EFFECTS OF EVEN LANGUID AND UN HEEDED MOTIONS LONDON 1685 T H E AUTHOR OF THIS ESSAY TELLS US HIMSELF THAT IT WAS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE THE EXPLICATING OF THE DOCTRINE OF OCCULT QUALITIES AND PREMISES THIS POSTULA TUM IN ORDER TO THE DEMONSTRATIONS THAT FOLLOW VIZ THAT WE ARE NOT TO CONSIDER BODYS AS SO MANY LUMPS OF MATTER THAT DIFFER ONLY IN BULK AND SHAPE BUT RATHER AS BODYS OF PECULIAR INTERNAL TEXTURES ON ACCOUNT OF WHICH THEY MUST BE CONSIDERED AS ENGINES WHOSE OPERATIONS BEING FURTHERED BY THE MECHANISM OF THE BODY WROUGHT ON AND THE RELATION OTHER BODYS HAVE TO IT A GREAT PART OF THE EFFECT IS DUE TO THE ACTION OF ONE PART OF THE BODY IT SELF THAT IS WROUGHT ON UPON ANOTHER ASSISTED BY THE CONCURRENCE OF THE NEIGHBOURING BODYS HENCE HE TAKES NOTICE OF THE CHIEF CAUSES UPON WHOSE ACCOUNT MEN ARE WONT TO OVERLOOK OR UNDER VALUE THE EFFICACY OF LO CAL MOTIONS WHICH ARE EITHER UNHEEDED OR THOUGHT LAN GUID THE FIRST THING OVERLOOKED IS THE EFFICACY OF THE CELERITY OF SMALL BODYS MOVING THROUGH A SMALL SPACE HOW GREAT THIS IS HE ILLUSTRATES BY CONSIDERING THE POWER FULL EFFECTS OF BULLETS THE GREAT INCALESCENCE CAUSED BY THE BRISK MOTION IN TURNING OF METALS AS STEEL AND BRASS THE FRAGMENTS OF WHICH ARE OFTEN SO HEATED AS NOT ONELY TO OFFEND THE EYLIDS BUT EVEN TO BLISTER THE HANDS OF THE WORKMEN VITRIFICATION IT SELF BEING PRODUCED BY THE COMMON STRIKING FIRE BETWEEN A FLINT AND STEEL NEITHER ARE FLUID BODYS UNCAPABLE OF MAKING IMPRESSIONS ON SOLID ONES WITNESS SUNBEAMS IN THE FOCUS OF A BURNINGGLASS THE FLAME OF A LAMP AND EVEN THE AIR IN A GOOD WIND GUN THOUGH WE ARE IN THE SECOND PLACE TOO APT TO THINK THE SOFTNESS OF FLUID BODYS AND THEIR INSENSIBLE MOTION MAY HINDER THEM FROM THOSE EFFECTS BUT TO SHE W983 SHEW THE CONTRARY BESIDES THE OBVIOUS INSTANCES OF DE LUGES AND STORMS HE PRODUCES MANY OF THE STRONG OPE RATIONS OF SOUNDS UPON DISTANT AND SOLID BODYS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE OF WHICH IS THE EFFECT OF AN INSTRU MENT THOUGH SMALL BY WHICH AN ENGINEER COULD SINK SHIPS IN A FEW MINUTES THE EXPLOSION BEING SO GREAT AS TO CAUSE A KIND OF STORM IN THE WATER ROUND ABOUT AND RUDELY SHAKE VESSELS THAT LAY AT NO INCONSIDERABLE DIS TANCE HE OBSERVES AGAIN THAT MEN UNDERVALUE THE MO TIONS OF BODYS TOO SMALL TO BE SENSIBLE THOUGH THE NU MEROUSNESS ENABLES THEM TO ACT IN SWARMS YET HOW LIT TLE REASON THEY HAVE FOR IT HE EVINCES BY THE OPERATION OF THE WIND IN AUTUMN THE DISSOLUTION OF SUGAR IN THAT WATER WHERE AMBER THOUGH LIGHTER SINKS AND REMAINS ENTIRE BY THE ACTIVITY OF THE FLAME OF SPIRIT OF WINE THAT OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS IN LARGE AND BULKY ANIMALS THE FORCIBLE MOTIONS PRODUCED BY GLACIATION IN LIQUORS C TO WHICH EFFECTS OF LOCAL MOTION ITS PROPAGABLE NA TURE EVEN THROUGH DIFFERING MEDIUMS AND SOLID BODYS DOES NOT A LITTLE CONDUCE FOR THOUGH IT BE TRUE THAT FLUID BODYS DO EASILY YIELD TO SOLID ONES THAT IMPEL THEM AND THEREBY OFTENTIMES QUICKLY DEAD THE MOTION OF THOSE SOLIDS YET THE MOTION BEING LOST ONLY IN REGARD OF THE SOLID BODY IS TRANSMITTED AND DISSUSED IN REFERENCE TO THE FLUID THE MODIFICATION OF THE INVISIBLE MOTION OF FLUIDS AS TO WHAT THEY MAY PERFORM ON THE DISPOSED BODYS OF A NIMALS IS AS LITTLE REGARDED THOUGH IT IS NOT SO DESPICA BLE IF WE BELIEVE SCALIGERS STORY OF THE SOUND OF THE BAG PIPE BEING TOO DIURETICAL UPON A KNIGHT OF GASCONY SE VERAL SORTS OF NOISES SET THE TEETH ON EDGE AND A DOMES TICK OF THE AUTHORS ALLWAYS BLED AT HIS GUMS WHEN HE HEARD BROWN PAPER TORE ADD TO THIS THE CURE OF THE TA RANTULA AND TWO VERSES OF LUCAN WHICH SELDOM FAIL TO PUT THE AUTHOR ALMOST INTO THE FIT OF AN AGUE C NEITHER IS EFFICACY CONFINED TO ORGANICAL BODYS BUT EX Z TENDS984 TENDS ALSO TO INORGANICAL ONES AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE SYMPATHY OF STRINGS RINGING OF A GLASS TO SUCH A NOTE AS LIKEWISE SOME ECCHOES ANSWERING ONLY CERTAIN SOUNDS AND THE LIKE THE MISTAKE LIKEWISE IS AS GREAT WHEN MEN LOOK UPON DIVERS BODYS TO HAVE THEIR PARTS IN A STATE OF ABSOLUTE REST WHEN AS THEY ARE IN A STATE OF TENSION OR COMPRESSION INSTANCES OF THIS ARE THE SUDDEN CRACKING OF GLASSES THAT SEEM TO BE WELL NEALD THE SCALING OF WELL HEATED COPPER THE BRITTLENESS OF MIXTURES OF METALLS ALL WHICH AND THE LIKE PROBABLY PROCEED FROM CONTRAC TION THE LAST MAIN CAUSE WHY SUCH MOTIONS ARE OVER LOOKED IS OUR BEING USED TO THE SENSIBLE MOTIONS OF SOLID BODYS WHEN AS MANY EFFECTS PROCEED FROM THE INTESTINE MOTIONS PRODUCED IN AND AMONG THE PARTS OF THE SAME BODY SUCH AS TOOLS BEING OVERHEATED AND BY BEING SO LOOSING THEIR TEMPER THE BREAKING OF OPTICK GLASSES IN GRINDING BODYS BECOMING ELECTRICAL AND ODOROUS BY RUBBING AND THE LIKE FROM ALL WHICH HE CONCLUDES THAT SUCH LOCAL MOTIONS AS ARE WONT TO BE PAST BY UNOBSERVED MAY HAVE A NOTABLE OPERATION UPON SUCH BODYS AS ARE PECULIARLY DISPOSED TO ADMIT IT AND SO HAVE A LARGE SHARE IN NATURAL PRODUCTIONS IN THE DISCOURSE OF SOME UNHEEDED CAUSES OF THE SALU BRITY AND INSALUBRITY OF THE AIR HE CONFINES HIMSELF TO THE IMPRAEGNATION IT RECEIVES FROM SUBTERRANEAL EFFLUVIA OF THESE HE MAKES TWO SORTS SOME CONSTANTLY ARE SENT UP IN TO THE AIR WHICH HE CALLS ORDINARY EMISSIONS OTHERS ASCEND ONELY AT TIMES THESE ARE EXTRAORDINARY EMISSIONS THESE AGAIN ARE PERIODICAL OR FORTUITOUS THIS DOCTRINE HE ENDEAVOURS TO ILLUSTRATE BY ASSERTING FIRST THAT IN DIVERS PLACES THE SALUBRITY OR INSALUBRITY OF THE AIR CONSIDERED IN THE GENERAL MAY IN GOOD PART BE DUE TO SUBTERRANEAL EXPIRATIONS ESPECIALLY TO THOSE HE BEFORE CALLED ORDI NARY EMISSIONS FOR THIS HE APPEALS TO EXPERIENCE WHICH FINDS SOME PLACES MORE HEALTHY THEN THE MANIFEST QUALI TIES WOULD PERMIT ONE TO EXPECT THIS EFFECT HE THEREFORE ASCRIBES985 ASCRIBES TO THE FRIENDLY EFFLUVIA FROM THE EARTH AND AR GUES FROM THE OBSERVATIONS IN HUNGARY AND BOHEMIA WHERE THE AIR IS IMPREGNATED WITH MINERAL EXHALATIONS SUITABLE TO THE OAR THE EARTH CONTAINS UNDER IT HE AF FIRMS IT ALSO PROBABLE THAT IN DIVERS PLACES SOME ENDEMI CAL DISEASES DO AT LEAST IN PART DEPEND UPON SUBTERRANEAL STEAMS ESPECIALLY WHERE THE CAUSE OF THE DISTEMPER CAN NOT OTHERWISE BE ACCOUNTED FOR IF TOGETHER WITH THIS WE CONSIDER THE PERVIOUSNESS OF HUMAN BODYS  THE PENETRAT ING QUALITY OF MINERAL EXPIRATIONS OF WHICH HE GIVES MA NY EXPERIMENTS LASTLY HE DISCOURSES OF PESTILENTIAL FEA VERS AND OF THE PLAGUE IT SELF AS TO WHOSE BEING NATURAL OR SUPERNATURAL HE ASSENTS RATHER TO ITS BEING THE FORMER HIS ENTIRE JUDGMENT ABOUT WHICH CONSISTS OF TWO PARTS ONE THAT IT IS EXCEEDING DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN THE TRUE AND ADAE QUATE CAUSE OF THE ORIGINE OF THE PESTILENCE AND THE O THER THAT WHAT EVER BE THE CAUSE OF ITS FIRST ERUPTION ITS PROPAGATION AND DIVERS OF ITS SYMPTOMES MAY BE PROBA BLY ENOUGH REFERRED TO THE DEPRAVATION OF THE AIR BY SUBTERRANEAL STEAMS AND THEIR EFFECTS C HE DESCRIBES THE EMPLASTRUM ATTRACTIVUM PESTILENTIALE TOGETHER WITH THE MAGNES ARSENICALIS A CHIEF INGREDIENT OF IT AND DISCOVERS HIS OPINION AND EXPERIENCE OF THE GREAT EFFICACY OF GOATSRUE IN MALIGNANT DISTEMPERS BUT WHEN MEDI CINE FAILS THOSE DISEASES GENERALLY APPEARING UNDER NEW SHAPES HE ACCOUNTS FOR THE SUDDEN CEASING OF THE CONTA GION AMONG OTHER WAYS BY THE ASCENSION OF FUMES OF A CONTRARY NATURE WHICH THOUGH PERHAPS IN THEMSELVES UNWHOLESOME MAY NEVERTHELESS COMBINE WITH THE PES TILENTIAL ONES INTO A THIRD KIND ALTOGETHER INNOCENT Z 2 AN AC986 TRICHIASIS ADMODUM RARA C LOND 1684 THIS TRICHIASIS OR FLUX OF HAIR CONTINUED FOR SOME YEARS BOTH AT A FISTULA IN THE ABDOMEN AND LIKEWISE BY THE ANUS THE MANNER IN SHORT THUS THIS WOMAN HAVING BEEN GONE SOME MONTHS WITH HER SECOND CHILD CAME TO DIEP WHERE CARELESLY GOING ON BOARD A VESSEL SHE HURT HER BELLY AGAINST A PLANK THIS BRUIFE WAS FOLLOWED BY A HUMOR WHICH ENDED IN A FISTULA WHENCE ISSUED GREAT QUANTITY OF HAIR ATTENDED WITH MUCH PURULENT MATTER TILL AT LENGTH THE VISCERA WERE CORRUPTED  THE FAECES CAME THAT WAY TOO SO THAT SHE DIED ANATOMY EASILY DISCOVERED THE WONDER OF HER SICKNESS THE CONTIGUOUS VISCERA WERE SPHACELATED THE RIGHT APPENDIX OF THE WOMB NOT DISTIN GUISHABLE INTO ITS KNOWN PARTS BUT CONSISTING OF ONE LONG TUMOR COVERED WITH A THICK SKIN WHICH WAS OPENED IN IT WAS FOUND AN OVAL BONY SUBSTANCE HAIRY ON THE UPPER PART HOLLOW ROUGH ON THE LOWER ONE END OF WHICH HAD SOME LINES OF A FACE THE OTHER SEEMD DESIGNED FOR THE INSER TION OF THE VERTEBRAE OF THE NECK THAT THIS BODY WAS THE SOURCE OF THAT SUCCESSION OF HAIR IS PLAIN FROM THEIR BE ITS AGREEING WITH THAT ON THE BONE AND LIKEWISE FROM THE EXPERIMENT OF THE AUTHORS WHO TELLS US THE HAIR CONTINUED STILL TO GROW THOUGH THE BONE HAD BEEN KEPT A LONG TIME IN SPIRIT OF WINE THIS CONCEPTION WAS IN THE TUBA FOR THE WOMB IT SELF WAS FOUND INTIRE THE SAGACITY OF DR FERD MENDEZ AFFIRMED THIS TO BE THE CASE WHILE THE WOMAN WAS ALIVE AND HIS EPISTLE TO THE AUTHOR ANNEXED TO THIS TRACT ACCOUNTS FOR THE PHAENOMENA OF THE DISTEMPER BOTH BY REASON AND EXAMPLES MR LA VASSEUR HAS LIKEWISE AN EPISTLE TO THE SAME PURPOSE IN WHICH HE VERY SATISFACTORILY DISCOURSES OF THREE THINGS FIRST HOW IT CAME TO PASSE THAT A PART OF AN EMBRYO DEAD SOME YEARS BE FORE REMAINED UNCORRUPTED SECONDLY HOW THE WOMB IT SELF ESCAPT AND LASTLY HOW THAT LONG CROP OF HAIR SHOULD PROCEED FROM SO SMALL AN ORIGINAL

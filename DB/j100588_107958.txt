J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107958,ON THE THEORY OF THE PERTURBATIONS OF THE PLANETS,I206987, 195  VIION THE THEORY OF THE PERTURBATIONS OF THE PLANETS BY JAMES IVORY AMI FRS INSTIT REG SC PARIS CORRESP ET REG SC GOTTIN CORRESP READ JANUARY 19 1832 I HE PERTURBATIONS OF THE PLANETS IS THE SUBJECT OF REITERATED RESEARCHES BY ALL THE GREAT GEOMETERS WHO HAVE RAISED UP PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY TO ITS PRESENT ELEVATION THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN DETERMINING THE VARIATIONS WHICH THE ELEMENTS OF THE ORBIT OF A DISTURBED PLANET UNDERGO AND IN EXPRESSING THESE VARIATIONS ANALYTICALLY IN THE MANNER BEST ADAPTED FOR COMPUTATION BUT THE INQUIRER WHO TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO THIS BRANCH OF STUDY WILL FIND THAT IT IS MADE TO DEPEND UPON A THEORY IN MECHANICS WHICH IS ONE OF CONSIDERABLE ANALYTICAL INTRICACY KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THE VARIATION OF THE ARBITRARY CONSTANTS CONSIDERATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE EMPLOYED IN THIS THEORY WERE FOUND NECESSARY IN PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY FROM ITS ORIGIN BUT THE GENIUS OF LAGRANGE IMAGINED AND COMPLETED THE ANALYTICAL PROCESSES OF GENERAL APPLI CATION IN A DYNAMICAL PROBLEM WHICH IS CAPABLE OF AN EXACT SOLUTION SUCH AS A PLANET REVOLVING BY THE CENTRAL ATTRACTION OF THE SUN THE FORMULAS CON STRUCTED BY LAGRANGE ENABLE US TO ASCERTAIN THE ALTERATIONS THAT WILL BE IN DUCED ON THE ORIGINAL MOTIONS OF THE BODY IF WE SUPPOSE IT URGED BY NEW AND VERY SMALL FORCES SUCH AS THE IRREGULAR ATTRACTIONS OF THE OTHER BODIES OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM GENERAL VIEWS OF THIS NATURE ARE VERY VALUABLE AND CONTRIBUTE GREATLY TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF SCIENCE BUT THEIR APPLICATION IS SOMETIMES ATTENDED WITH INCONVENIENCE IN PARTICULAR CASES THE GENERAL STRUCTURE OF THE FORMULAS MAY REQUIRE A LONG TRAIN OF CALCULATION IN ORDER TO EXTRICATE THE VALUES OF THE QUANTITIES SOUGHT IT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR AT TAINING THIS END TO PASS THROUGH MANY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AND TO SUBMIT TO MUCH SUBORDINATE CALCULATION THE REMEDY FOR THIS INCONVENIENCE SEEMS TO LIE IN SEPARATING THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES FROM THE ANALYTICAL PROCESSES BY WHICH THEY ARE CARRIED INTO EFFECT IN SOME IMPORTANT PROBLEMS A GREAT ADVANTAGE 2C 2MR IVORY ON THE THEORY BOTH IN BREVITY AND CLEARNESS WILL BE OBTAINED BY ADAPTING THE INVESTIGATION TO THE PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF THE CASE AND ATTENDING SOLELY TO THE PRINCI PLES OF THE METHOD IN DEDUCING THE SOLUTION IT MAY THEREFORE BECOME A QUES TION WHETHER IT BE NOT POSSIBLE TO SIMPLIFY PHYSICAL ASTRONOMY BY CALLING IN THE AID ONLY OF THE USUAL PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS AND BY SETTING ASIDE EVERY FORMULA OR EQUATION NOT ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY FOR ARRIVING AT THE FINAL RESULTS THE UTILITY OF SUCH AN ATTEMPT IF SUCCESSFUL CAN HARDLY BE DOUBTED BY REN DERING MORE ACCESSIBLE A SUBJECT OF GREAT INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THE STUDY OF ENGLISH MATHEMATICIANS MAY BE RECALLED TO A THEORY WHICH ALTHOUGH IT ORIGINATED IN ENGLAND HAS NOT RECEIVED THE ATTENTION IT DESERVES AND WHICH IT HAS MET WITH IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES THE PAPER WHICH I HAVE THE HONOUR TO SUBMIT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY CONTAINS A COMPLETE DETERMINATION OF THE VARIABLE ELEMENTS OF THE ELLIPTIC ORBIT OF A DIS TURBED PLANET DEDUCED FROM THREE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS THAT FOLLOW READILY FROM THE MECHANICAL CONDITIONS OF THE PROBLEM IN APPLYING THESE EQUATIONS THE PROCEDURE IS THE SAME WHETHER A PLANET IS URGED BY THE SOLE ACTION OF THE CENTRAL FORCE OF THE SUN OR IS BESIDES DISTURBED BY THE ATTRACTION OF OTHER BODIES REVOLVING ABOUT THAT LUMINARY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE BEING THAT IN THE FIRST CASE THE ELEMENTS OF THE ORBIT ARE ALL CONSTANT WHEREAS IN THE OTHER CASE THEY ARE ALL VARIABLE THE SUCCESS OF THE METHOD HERE FOLLOWED IS DERIVED FROM A NEW DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION BETWEEN THE TIME AND THE AREA DESCRIBED BY THE PLANET IN ITS MOMENTARY PLANE WHICH GREATLY SHORTENS THE INVESTIGATION BY MAKING IT UNNECESSARY TO CONSIDER THE PROJECTION OF THE ORBIT BUT THE SOLUTION IN THIS PAPER ALTHOUGH NO REFERENCE IS MADE TO THE ANALYTICAL FORMULAS OF THE THEORY OF THE VARIATION OF THE ARBITRARY CONSTANTS IS NO LESS AN APPLICATION OF THAT METHOD AND AN EXAMPLE OF ITS UTILITY AND OF THE NECESSITY OF EMPLOYING IT IN VERY COMPLICATED PROBLEMS 1 IF S REPRESENT THE SUN AND P PF TWO PLANETS CIRCULATING ROUND THAT LUMI NARY IT IS PROPOSED TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECT OF THE ATTRACTION OF P TO DISTURB THE MOTION OF P AND TO CHANGE THE ELEMENTS OF ITS ORBIT WE HERE CONFINE OUR ATTENTION TO ONE DISTURBING PLANET FOR THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN EXTENDING TO ANY NUMBER THE CONCLUSIONS THAT SHALL BE ESTABLISHED IN THE CASE OF

THAT ENTER INTO EVERY FORMULA BUT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO KNOW THE FORM OF THE TERMS WE MUST LIKEWISE ATTEND TO THEIR CONVERGENCY IN THE PRESENT STATE OF THE HEAVENS THERE IS NO DIFFICULTY IN THIS RESPECT BECAUSE THE ECCENTRI CITIES OF THE PLANETARY ORBITS AND THEIR INCLINATIONS TO THE ECLIPTIC ARE FOUND TO BE SMALL AND IT IS UPON THE SMALLNESS OF THESE QUANTITIES THAT THE CONVERGENCY OF THE SERIES INTO WHICH R IS DEVELOPED MAINLY DEPENDS IN THE PRESENT CIR CULNSTANCES OF THE PLANETARY SYSTEM THE FORMULAS AFFORD THE UTMOST POSSIBLE FACILITY FOR COMPUTING THE INEQUALITIES OF THE ELLIPTIC ELEMENTS AFTER ALL THE INQUIRY IS DIFFICULT ENOUGH WHEN IT IS CARRIED BEYOND A FIRST APPROXIMATION FOR IN THE SECOND STAGE OF THE PROCESS EVERY ELEMENT THAT ENTERS INTO A FORMULA BEING ITSELF A COLLECTION OF SINES OR COSINES IT IS NOT EASY TO BE ASSURED OF THE NATURE OF THE QUANTITIES ARISING FROM THE COMBINATION OF SO MANY COMPLEX EXPRESSIONS IF WE EXTEND OUR VIEWS AND CONSIDER THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM OF THE WORLD IT IS NECESSARY TO BEGIN WITH ESTABLISHING THE CONVERGENCY OF THE TERMS INTO WHICH R IS EXPANDED THE MATHEMATICAL FORM OF THESE TERMS WILL ALWAYS BE THE SAME BUT UNLESS THEIR TOTAL AMOUNT CAN BE ESTIMATED WITH SUFFICIENT EX ACTNESS BY A LIMITED NUMBER OF THEM THE HUMAN UNDERSTANDING CAN COME TO NO SOLID DECISION NOW THIS WILL DEPEND UPON THE EFFECT OF THE PERTURBATIONS IN CHANGING THE ECCENTRICITIES AND THE INCLINATIONS OF THE ORBITS TO THE ECLIPTIC MDCCCXXXII 2 G 225MR IVORY ON THE THEORY IF IT CAN BE PROVED THAT THESE ELEMENTS AFTER AIN INDEFINITE LAPSE OF TIME WILL REMAIN OF INCONSIDERABLE MAGNITUDE AS THEY ARE AT PRESENT THE CONVERGENCY OF THE SERIES WILL BE ESTABLISHED AND THE FORM OF THE TERMS OF WHICH R CONSISTS WILL ENABLE US TO COMPUTE THE CHANGES IN ALL THE ELLIPTIC ELEMENTS AND TO DE CIDE THE GREAT QUESTION OF THE STABILITY OF THE SYSTEM BUT WE CANNOT ENTER UPON ANY EXTENDED DISCUSSION OF THESE POINTS AND SHALL CONCLUDE THIS PAPER WITH SOME REMARKS IN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PROBLEM WE HAVE SOLVED AND OF THE MANNER IN WHICH WE HAVE SOLVED IT 6 IF WE SUPPOSE THAT THERE IS NO DISTURBING FORCE OR THAT R  0 WE SHALL HAVE BY THE EQUATION 1 1  E DX2  DY2

ELLIPTIC ORBIT DEPENDS ONLY UPON THE RADIUS VECTOR DRAWN TO ANY POINT AND UPON THE VELOCITY AT THAT POINT CONCEIVE THAT THE STRAIGHT LINE R EXTENDS FROM THE SUN IN A GIVEN DIRECTION AND TO A GIVEN LENGTH AND FROM ITS EXTREMITY SUPPOSE THAT A PLANET IS LAUNCHED INTO SPACE WITH THE VELOCITY V THE FOREGOING EQUATION WILL DETER MINE THE MEAN DISTANCE A OF THE IMMOVEABLE ELLIPSE IN WHICH TLLE PLANET WILL REVOLVE THE POINT FROM WHICH THE PLANET IS PROJECTED AND CONSEQUENTLY R REMAINING THE SAME  AND V2 WILL VARY TOGETHER AND IF WE SUPPOSE THAT A BECOMES EQUAL TO A AT THE SAME TIME THAT V2 IS CHANGED INTO V2  D V2 BY FORCES WHICH ACT CONTINUALLY BUT INSENSIBLY WE SHALL HAVE THESE EQUATIONS D DV2 AND AA FV2 A A IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT THE DISTURBING FORCES ACTING IN THE DIRECTIONS OF X Y Z DR DR DR AND TENDING TO INCREASE THESE LINES ARE RESPECTIVELY DR DY DZ AND BY THE PRINCIPLES OF DYNAMICS DOUBLE THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS OF THESE FORCES EACH BEING MULTIPLIED BY THE ELEMENT OF ITS

THESE RESULTS AGREE WITH THE INVESTIGATION IN THE FOURTH SECTION OF THIS PAPER AND THEY COINCIDE WITH THE REMARKABLE EQUATION FIRST DISCOVERED BY LAGRANGE FROM WHICH HE INFERRED THE INVARIABILITY OF THE MEAN DISTANCES AND THE PERIODIC TIMES OF THE PLANETS WHEN THE APPROXIMATION IS EXTENDED TO THE FIRST POWER ONLY OF THE DISTURBING FORCE IT HAS ALREADY BEEN OBSERVED THAT D R   S IS THE DISTURBING FORCE PER PEINDICULAR TO THE PLANE PASSING THROUGH THE SUN AND THE COORDINATE Z THAT IS D R 1 S2 TO THE PLANETS CIRCLE OF LATITUDE AND LIKEWISE THAT D   IS THE DISTURB ING FORCE IN THE SAME PLANE

METHOD IN EQUATION 3 OF THE SECOND SECTION AND FROM WHICH THE VALUE OF H2 THE SEMIPARAMETER OF THE VARIABLE ELLIPTIC ORBIT WAS DEDUCED THAT ELEMENT IS THEREFORE AS MUCH AN IMMEDIATE DEDUCTION FROM THE DISTURBING FORCES AS IS THE MEAN DISTANCE IN THE EQUATION OF LAGRANGE AS THE VARIATION OF A IS THE EFFECT OF THE DISTURBING FORCE IN ALTERING THE VELOCITY IN THE ORBIT SO THE VARIATION OF H2 IS THE EFFECT OF THAT PART OF THE DISTURBING FORCE WHICH ALTERS THE EXACT PROPORTIONALITY TO THE TIMNES OF THE AREAS DESCRIBED ROUND THE SUN THE TWO ELEMENTS ARE TOGETHER SUFFICIENT FOR DETERMINING BOTH THE FORM AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE MOMENTARY ELLIPTIC ORBIT THE PLACING OF THIS ELLIPSE SO AS TO BE IN INTIMATE CONTACT WITH THE REAL PATH OF THE PLANET A PROCEDURE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO FINDING THE RELATION BETWEEN THE ARCS 0 AND V DETERMINES THE MOTION OF THE LINE OF THE APSIDES IF LASTLY WE ATTEND TO THAT PART OF THE DISTURBING FORCE WHICH IS PERPEN DICULAR TO THE CIRCLE OF LATITUDE PASSING THROUGH THE PLANET AND PROCEED AS BEFORE WE SHALL OBTAIN THE DIFFERENTIAL OF THE EQUATION 4 IN THE SECOND SECTION THIS DIFFERENTIAL IS THEREFORE THE EFFECT OF THE DISTURBING FORCE IN ALTERING THE MOMENTARY AREA WHICH IS DESCRIBED IN THE IMMOVEABLE PLANE OF XY AND WHICH WITHOUT THE ACTION OF THIS FORCE WOULD BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE TIME THE ELEMEN TARY AREA IN THE IMMOVEABLE PLANE IS THE PROJECTION OF THE AREA DESCRIBED IN THE SAME TIME IN THE PLANE OF THE ORBIT THE PROPORTION OF THE TWO DETERMINES THE COSINE OF THE INCLINATION OF THE VARIABLE PLANE IN WHICH THE PLANET MOVES AND FROM THIS IT IS EASY TO DETERMINE THE POSITION OF THE LINE OF THE NODES AS HAS BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED WHAT HAS BEEN SAID IS INDEPENDENT OF THE NATURE OF THE FORCES IN ACTION AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE SAME METHOD MAY BE APPLIED TO ESTIMATE THE EFFECT OF ANY EXTRANEOUS FORCE IN DISTURBING THE ELLIPTIC MOTION OF A PLANET IT WOULD APPEAR THAT IN THE VIEW WE HAVE TAKEN OF THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE BEEN MAKING AN APPROACH TO SOME GENERAL HINTS CONTAINED IN THE COROLLARIES OF THE SEVENTEENTH PROPOSITION OF THE FIRST BOOK OF THE PRINCIPIA A CONNEXION BETWEEN THE MOST RECONDITE RESULTS OF MODERN ANALYTICAL SCIENCE AND THE ORIGINAL IDEAS THROWN OUT BY AN AUTHOR WHO ALTHOUGH HE ACCOMPLISHED SO MUCH HAS UNAVOIDABLY LEFT MUCH TO BE SUPPLIED BY HIS SUCCESSORS IS UN DOUBTEDLY WORTHY OF BEING REMARKED AND MAY

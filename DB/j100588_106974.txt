S,i206953,VIII An Account of some Endeavours to ascertain a Standard of Weigbt and Measure By Sir George Shuckburgh Evelyn Bart FRS and AS Read February 22 1799  1 HAVING for some years turned my thoughts to the considera tion of an invariable and imperishable standard of weight and measure as being a thing in a philosophical view highly de sirable and likely to become extremely beneficial to the public I had so early as the year i78o taken up the idea of an uni versal measure from whence all the rest might be derived by means of a pendulum with a moveable centre of suspension capable of such adjustments as to be made to vibrate any num ber of times in a given interval and by comparison of the dfference of the vibrations with the diference of the lengths of the pendulum which difference alone might be the standard measure to determine its positive length if that should be thought preferable under any given circumstances by which means all the difficulties arising in determining the actual centre of motion and of oscillation which have hitherto so much embarrassed these experiments would be gotten over 2  I made several computations of the probable accuracy that might be expected from such an experiment and was sa tisfied with their result But not seeing clearly how such a pendulum could be connected to a piece of mechanism ta13 Sir GEORGE SHUCKnBUnH EVELYNS Endeavours number the vibrations without affecting them I dropped the idea for that time I learnt however some time afterwards that Mr JOHN WHIT9HR4S a very inious person had been in pursuit of the same object with better success andhad con trived a machine fully corresponding to his expectations and my wishes This he afterwards explained to the world in a pamphlet entitled An Attempt to obtain Measures of Length c from the Mensuration of Time or the true Len gth of Pendulums published in 1787 Mr WHITEHURST having therein done all that related to the standard measure of length and suggested that of weight it appeared to me tha it remained only to yerify and complete his experiments  3 For this purpose by the kind assistance of my friend Dr G FoRDYCE who at Mr WHITEHURSTs death had Lur chased his apparatus I was furnished with the very machine with which Mr WHITEIURST had made his observations I also procured to be made by Mr TROUGHTON a very excellent beamcompass or divided scalefurnished with microscopes and micrometer for the most exact observations oflongitudinal mea sure as also a very nice beam or hydrostatic balance sensible with the ri of a grain when loaded with 61b Troy at each end Mr ARNOLD made me one of his admirable timekeepers in order to carry time from my sidereal regulator in my bser vatory with which it was adjusted to the room wherein I had fixed Mr WHITEHURSTs pendulum and who having taken a journey from London into Warwickshire was so good as to assist in the beginning of these experiments Thus equipped I went to work in the latter end of August 1796 when the temperature was about 6o0 first to examine the length of the pendulum when to my great mortification I found that theto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure I thin wire of which the rod consisted was too weak to support the ball in a state of vibration and that after 15 or 2 hours action it repatedly broke The same misfortune attended my trials with three othe different sorts of wires that I had obtained from London Whether this accident happened from any rust in the old wire or from want of due temper in the new or from its being too much pinched between the cheeks I cannot tell I canD only observe that all the wires that I used were con siderably heavier and therefore probably stronger than what Mr WIITEH URST mentions viz grains in weight for8o inches in length nay mine proceeded as far as from to 6 grains  for that length and yet I could never get it to support the ball during the whole period of my experiment This being the caseand being in the country far removed from the manufictory of this line wire I was reluctantly compelledto relinquish this part of the operation to some more favourable opportunity In the mean while however I thought it desirable to measure the dif ference of the lengths of Mr WHITEHURSTs pendulum from his own observations or very fortunately the marks that he had made on the brass vertical ruler of his machine were still visible and this interval which he calls  59892 inches I determined on my divided scale made by TROUGHTON from Mkr BIRDS standard to be  989358 inches from a mean of four different trials in the temperature of 64 that meafrdiffer ing from the extremes only ooo inch  4 By this examination if I have not verified I have at least preserved Mr WHITEURSTS standard and for the present I shall consider this measure of the difference of the length of the two pendulums vibrating 42 and 84 times in a  CC fig i of Plate II in Mr WHITEHURSTINS pamphlet136 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours minute of mean time as correct On this presumption I shall proceed to the examination of weight    From the opinion of different skilful persons with whom I have conferred as well as from the result of my own considerations I am inclined to believe there is hardly any body in nature with which we are familiarly acquainted that is of so simple and homogeneous a quality as pure distilled Water or so fit for the purposes of this inquiry and I have concluded that if the weight of any quantity of Water whose bulk had been previously measured by the abovementioned scale could be obtained under a known pressure and temperature of the at mosphere we should be in possession of a general standard of weight  6 With this view I directed Mr TROUGHTON to make in addition to the very sensible hydrostatic balance before men tioned a solid cube of brass whose sides were 5 inches and also a cylinder of the same metal 4 inches in diameter and 6 high From St Thomass hospital by the favour of Dr FoR DYCE I procured 3 gallons of distilled water With these I made the following observations but before I relate the ex periments I will describe the apparatus Mr WHITEHURSTS machine for measuring the pendulum has been sufficiently explained in his pamphlet mentioned above my divided scale which was a new instrument was as follows v I do not here mean to infer any opinion respecting the compressibility of water but only to say that where water or any thing else is weighed in air the density of that medium as shewnwby the barometer and thermometer must be known in order to make allowances for it if necessaryto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 1i7  7 Descrioption of the Beam Compass or divided Scale of equal Parts a b Tab V fig i is a block or beam of mahogany 6 feet 3 inches long 6 inches deep and  wide upon which are laid two brass rulers c d e and fg each divided into 60 inches and tenths The former of these called the Scale is for a time kept immoveable by the fingerscrews c e d and is furnished with very fine hairline divisions intended to be viewed only by the microscopes h i the latter called the Beam has no motion but by means of the screw g and bears stronger divisions upon it with which the sliding pieces or ins dexes at k and m may readily be compared by the naked eye and is intended only to set the microscopes or rather the wires in their focus to the required distance nearly viz to within I O or L of an inch The microscopes are compound and similar to those described by the late Geheral Roy in his account of his large theodolite See Phil Trans Vol LXXX The one at h contains only cross wires fixed in its focus the other at i has a micrometer also by means of which its cross wires may be moved to the right or left over the image of the divi sions of the scale any given space not exceeding I inch and the quantity so moved may be measured by the divisions on the screw head passing under the index at v The divisions on these rules have been called inches and tenths it was not necessary that they should be more than eqsual parts but they were in fact laid down by Mr TROUGHTON from a scale of the late excellent artist Mr J BIRD who had divided into inches several scales of different lengths one of which 42 inches long belonged to the late General Roy a second of 5 feet was purchased by ALEXANDER AUBERT Esq and a third of MDCCXCvIII T138 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBUR GH EVELYNS Endeavours go inches which is now the property of the Royal Society is kept in their archives and is said to have been used by Mr BIRD in dividing his large mural quadrants Besides these he made two standards of three feet by order of the House of Commons of which I shall speak more hereafter The mode of using this instrument is as follows  8 Let the object to be measured be supposed to be about six inches and let it be desired to compare it with the interval between the 20th and the 26th division on the scale c d move by hand the microscope h with its sliding plate until the division of the index at k coincide with the division of 20 inches on the rulefg then move by hand also the microscope i with its sliding plate and appendage I m n o until the index division near m coincide with 26 inches onfg the axes of the micro scopes or centres of their cross wires will be at the approximate distance of 6 inchles T o correct this examine if the wires of b correspond with a division on c d if not move the rule fg backward or forwvard by the scrw g till they do then will the microscope h be adjusted Now examine if the wires in a cover exactly a division if they do so the true interval of 6 inches between the microscopes is obtained if not move the microscope i a little by means of the screw 1 till they do and both the microscopes will be adjusted  then remove the rule c e d from its place by taking out the screws c e d and place the object to be measured in its room at the same time taking care that it be exactly in the focus of the object glass of the microscope in such manner that one extremity may cor respond with the wires in the microscope b that done if the other extremity coincide with the wires in i the dimension of the object is exactly 6 inches if not restore the coincidences  A farther account of these scales is given in the Appendixto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure I  by turning the micrometer

paratus when not in use and when used serves as a foot to the hollow brass pillar efg h which is fixed into it by the four screws at the bottom e and This pillar contains another within it which is raised up and down about t inch by means of the screw x n o is the beam 27 inches long and 9 inches wide in its greatest diameter each arm of which is made hollow and conical for strength glnd lightness through the centre at m passes the axis of motion the ends of which when used are suffered to fall gently upon two crystal planes which are set horizontally by means of the spirit levels k 1 and the screws underneath the box at c and b The endsof this axis are of hardened steel of a wedgelike shape and reduced to a fine edge viz to an angle of about 40o so as to move upon the planes with very little friction and at the same time so hard as with due care in using to be in no danger of be ing blunted to prevent which the inner pillar has a motion upwards as has been said by the screw x and by means of a semicircular arm at its upper extremity lifts the beam off its bearings when it is not used or is greatly loaded This axis is placed carefully at right angles to the beam and by means of two small brass springs that press gently at the ends is brought always to have the same bearing upon the crystal so that no error need be feared from a small deviation from the rghtangular position of the axis to the beam should any such T 2140 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN s Endeavousrs exist and from its shape and quality it may be considered as in flexible in any ordinary experiments Atp is a small adjusting screw which raises or depresses a weight within and with it in consequence the centre of gravity of the whole beam by this means the motion on its centre may be brought to almost any required degree of sensibility Should the centre of gra vity be raised above the centre of motion the beam would turn over if it be in that centre the beam would stand any where indifferently without any vibration if it be placed much below it the vibration would be too quick and its sensibility not suffi cient it is therefore brought by the screwp a very small quan tity below the centre of motion so as to describe one vibration in 40 or 5o seconds the sensibility is then fully sufficient At each end of the beam are circular boxes n and o through which pass the steel centres from whence are suspended the scalepans q and r these centres resemble in some degree those at m but have their chamfered or angular edges upwards and thereon hang the hooks P to which are affixed the links o and to them the three silken lines of the scale Each of these centres has a motion in its respective box by means of two small adjusting screws that in o laterally and that in n ver tically the former to make the two arms of the beam of an equal length the latter to bring the three points of suspension of the beam and scales into a right line At the extremity of the boxes are fixed two needle points or indexes which play against the ivory scale of divisions at s and t These divisions although they do not indeed they cannot shew any definite weight are nevertheless very

inches which is equal to then exact bulk of the sphere as will be seen hereafterto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 143  X1 It was necessary to measure the exact size and cor rectness of figure of this sphere For this purpose was made a woodengauge orframe abcdeTabV fig 2 in which the sphere was placed upon semicircular pieces within lined with green cloth to prevent bruising it upon this frame was placed a brass square k I m n whose sides were about inch in length more than the diameter of the sphere This square by raising or lowering the screws o r s was easily made to coincide with a plane passing through the centre of the sphere p is a micro meter screw the interior extremity of which is brought just to touch the surface of the sphere while the opposite side bears gently against the interior side of the frame at o and by turns ing the sphere round so as to present different diameters to these points of contact any variety in the diameter may be seen by the index 1 and plate q divided into iooooths inch To render this operation more convenient three great circles were drawn with a pencil upon the sphere at 90o distance from each other the two former were traced by the artist in the lathe while the sphere was making and the third was drawn front them and each was divided into 8 equal parts The im m ediate result of these experiments would only give the diffe rences and not the absolute quantity of the diameter for this purpose a brass ruler r fig 3 was made of such a length as just to go within the brass frame k I m n and being sub stituted in the place of the sphere could easily be compared with any given diameter and afterwards measured with the divided scale fig i With these instruments I made the fol lowing observations August31 1796 the thermometer being at 610144 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours  iz Examination of the Dimensions of the Brass Cube by Means of the divided Scale The microscope and micrometer being both adjusted as well with respect to their focus as to the value of the micrometer scale the cross wires in their focus were removed to a distance from each other of five inches nearly on the beam the former being at 27 and the latter at 32 inches and then correctly ad justed to this interval on the divided scale I must observe indeed that the value of the micrometer scale was not exactly ten revolutions of the screw to  inch as Mr TROUGHTON designed but this measure by the screwt from 6 trials was deficient by 00002 inch viz two tenthousandths of an inch were to be added to each tenth of an inch measured by the micrometer and so in proportion for a less quantity but this correction is hardly worth notice On the scale The interval of the cross wires in the inc1h inch inches microscope and micrometer

mean measures of the side of the cube multiplied into each other will give 12418917 cubic inches for the contents of the brass cube which must be very near the truth for if not let us suppose the error in ta king each of these measurements to be half a thousandth of an inch which is much greater than is probable viz  part of the side of the cube and let us suppose each of these errors to lie the same way which is also very improbable in that casethe error in determining the solid content would be only 9o of the whole in the above instance about 03 cubic inch but more probably the error does not amount to half this quantity  14 Examination of the Cylinder The micrometer and microscope of the divided scale Tab V fig 1 being removed till their cross wires were four inches distant viz

It may proceed from two causes which we will now inquire into But first it may be observed that the accuracy in measuring the dimensions of these two bodies as well as the precision in weighing them has I think been such as to put out of all doubt this part of the experiment From whence then does this difference arise Either of two causes may be suspected viz the pressure of the water against the sides of these two bodies altering their volumes which it may be presumed would have a greater ef fect on the cube from its figure than on the cylinder and in a direction agreeable to this difference that is it would dimi nish the capacity of the cube more than that of the cylinder and thus make the apparent weight of a cubic inch less in the experiment of the cube But also we see that the cylinder was  The weight of a cubic inch of common or rain water has been reckoned about 253 grains sometimes 25333 grains at others 25318 But authors do not seem to have agreed in what they meant by common water rain water pump water spring water and distilledL water for occasionally they are all confounded and made to pass for each other and sufficient notice seems not to have been taken of the temperature to which these weights were assigned See MARTI NS Pbilosobbia Bri lannica L E w I ss Philosophical Commerce of Arts Cii A M F PR ss Dictionary by Drv REES ESC to ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 157 weighed at a greater depth by 12 inch than the cube below the surface of the water Now if it be true that water is com pressible it wvill become denser from its weight at different depths and this circumstance would act in the same way with that just mentioned viz would make the apparent weight of a cubic inch less from the experiment of the cube than the cylin der which we see is the fact 9 2 In order to dissipate these doubts I caused a very accu rate hollow brass sphere to be made of about six inches diameter and of such thickness of metal viz 013 inch as to be very little heavier than water and yet of such strength as together with its form to resist any probable change of bulk by the pressure of water This sphere which has already been mentioned  co was

but when the bar r is placed there it shews  645 the difference is     208 and by so much is the bar shorter than the diameter of the sphere inhe inches These divisions 20 8 are equal to  26  000202 andthe length of thebar has already 25 been found6oo543 therefore the true diameter of the sphere becomes 600745 which quantity I think must be true to within 1 inch  28 The cube of this diameter 600745 inches x 5236 as is well known will give the contents of the sphere in cubic inches viz  1135194 inches which must be very near the truth for if not let it be supposed that the inaccuracy in the measuremnent or the irregularities in the figure of this sphereto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 1Gi should be such as to amount to 5 inch and these so many without balancing each other as to produce a spheroidical form one of whose diameters should exceed the other by l inch in that case the error in the assumed solid would not exceed 3J otpart of the whole and this is a position infinitely too ex travagant to be admitted when we recollect that this diameter has been probably taken to within a tenth part of that error  9  The weight of this sphere in air and in water

contents of this sphere having already  28 been found to be  113519 cubic inches 3867353 252587 grains will be the weight of a cubic inch of dis tilled water under the circumstances above mentioned by Mr TROUGHTONS weights  I think it may now be concluded that the variety in the experiments of the cylinder and the cube  24 does not proceed from the different depths t in the water at which they were made at least that the pressure of 3 inches in perpen dicular height of water does not render that fluid more dense by r partl which may be reckoned an insensible quantity  but that this variety did proceed from a difference in the yield ing of the sides of the cub and the cylinder And lastly I hope it may be trusted that the weight of a bulk of water a But as will appear hereafter  41 these weights are too light when com pared with the standard in the House of Commons by about 1 in 152392 the correction therefore for this difference would be o165 grain to be deducted from 252587 grains  I65 And the weight of aubic inch of distilled water in grains of 25242 2 the parliamentary standard will be   j t By means of an alteration and addition to my apparatus since the experiment abovementioned was made I have been able to repeat it at greater depths below the surface of the water viz when the centre of the sphere was 5 inches 13 inches and2 I inches below without any appearance of water having a sensible difference of density at different depths The vessel I used for this purpose was of wood 32 inches high and 1 2 square containing i6 gallons with two sides of plateglass to admit the light and the wires by which the sphere was suspended were 45 inches long and stronger than before viz ico inches of the single wire weighed 2414 grains and due allowance was made for the different weight of the scale and wires in air and water from actual experimentto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 165 the sphere has been determined to within of the whole and probably to within half that quantity  32 Having then through the means of Mr WrnTE HURSTS observations and of his own instrument ascertained the length of his proposed standard in the latitude of London I I3 feet above the level of the sea under a density of the at mosphere corresponding to go inches of the barometer and 6o0 of the thermometer which is full as satisfactory for all practical purposes as if it had been done in vacuot which I conceive to be nearly impossible and having determined the weight of any given bulk of water compared with this common measure I believe it now only remains to ascertain the proportion of this common measure and weight to the commonly received mea suros and weights of this kingdom X  It is perfectly true that if I chose to indulge in fan ciful speculation I might neglectthese comparisons as an un philosophical condescension to modern convenience or to an cient practice and might adopt some more magnificent integer than the English pound orfathom such as the diameter or cir cumjerence of the world c c and without much skill in the learned languages and with little difficulty I might ape the barbarisms of the present day But in truth with much incoilvenience I see no possible good in changing the quan tities the divisions or the names of things of such constant recurrence in common life I should therefore humbly submit it to the good sense of the people of tbese kingdoms at least to  The height as I have been informed of the room of Mr WHITFnv s rs obser vatior s t It is perfectly true that this supposes the experiment to be made with a pendtsu lum siitilar to Mr WHITEFIURT Si66 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours preserve with the measures the language of their forefathers I would call a yard a yard and a pound a pound without any other alteration than what the precision of our own artists may obtain for us or what the lapse of ages or the teeth of ti me may have required  34 The difference of the length of the two pendu lums from Mr WHITEHURSTS observations appearing to be 5989358 inches oin Mr TROUGHTONs scale and a cubic inch of distilled water in a known state of the atmosphere having been found to weigh 252587 Troy grains according to the weights of the same artist it remains only to determine the proportions of these weights and measures to those that have been usually or may be fitly considered as the standards of this kingdom and herein a small discrepancy between them selves in these authoritative standards will have no influence on the general conclusion I propose to draw which is not so much to say what has been the standard of Great Britain as what it shall be henceforward and may be immutably so and which shall differ but a very small quantity and that an as signable one from those that have been in use for two orthree hundred years past By these means no inconvenience would be produced from change of terms or subdivisions of parts or from sensible deviation from ancient practice all that will be done will be to render that certain and permanent which has hitherto been fluctuating or liable to fluctuation To give effect and energy to these suggestions is the province of another power   The chief standards of longitudinal measure as far as I can learn that carry any authority with them are those preserved in the Exchequer in the House of Commons at theto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 167 Royal Society and in the Tower The first alone indeed bear legal authority and have been in use for more than 200 years the last is considered as a copy of them and is not used for sizing generally The two remaining ones are of modern date and although they do not carry with them at present any statuteable authority yet from the high reputation and acknow ledged care of the artists who made them the celebrated Mr GEORGE GRAHAM and Mr JOHN BIRD are undoubtedly en titled to very great respect and are probably derived from a mean result of the comparisons of the old and discordant ones in the Exchequer I shall begin with that of Mr GRAHAM which contains also the length of the Tower standard laid down upon it will proceed then to Mr BIRDS and finally conclude with those at the Exchequer  36 May i 1797 I went to the apartments of the Royal Society at Somerset House and with the ready assistance of Mr GILPIN at the kind instance of Sir JOSEPH BANKS I made the following observations on Mr GRAHAMS  brass standard yard made in 1742 This scale is about 42 inches long and half an inch wide containing three parallel lines engraven thereon on the exterior and ulterior of which are three divisions expressing feet with the letter E at the last division and by a memoran dum preserved with it in the archives of the Society is said to signify English measure as taken from the standard in the Tower of London That with the letter F denoting the length of the half of the French toise put on here by the authority and under the inspection of the Royal Academy of Sciences then  This rod was not made by Mr GRAHAM but at his instance procured by him from Mr JONATHAN Sisso N a celebrated artist of that time See Phil Trans Vol

for 1768 p 324 As I am now upon the subject of foreign measure it may not be quite out of place to say a word on the length of the ancient Roman foot which I am enabled to do with some precision Some years ago when I was in Italy I had several opportunities of ascertaining the length of this measure by actual examination of the Roman foot rules of which I have met with nine viz two in the Capitol at Rome one in the Vatican five in the Museum at Portici near Naples and lastly one in the British Museum sent from Naples by Sir WI L LI AM HAMILTON They were all of brass except one halffoot of ivory with a joint in the middle resembling our common box or ivory rules and by reference to my journal kept at that time I find the mean result from all the nine rules viz by taking both the whole and the parts of each for they were divided into ia inches and also into i6ths or digits gave for the length of the old Roman foot in English inches correspondent to Mr BIRDS measure ii6063 In confirmation also of this conclusion and agreeably to the idea of Mons DE LA CONDAM 1 NE in the  Journal of his Tour to Italy I took theqdimensions of seve ral ancient buildings viz the interior diameter of the temple of Vesta the width of the arch of Severus the door of the Pantheon and the width of the base of the quadrilateral pyramid of Cestius which it is curious to observe I found exactly ioo old Roman feet and 125 feet high This I do not remember to have seen noticed by any former traveller The mean result of these experiments gave me I617 English inches Ditto as before from the rules    i x6o6 ditto The mean of the two modes of determination is  1 161 2 ditto I may add that in the Capitol is a stone of no very ancient date however let into the wall on which is engraven

GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNs Endeavours  8 From the information in the report of a committee of the House of Commons that sat in the year 1758 1 learnt that Mr BIRDS parliamentary standard had been in the cus tody of some of its officers but of whom nobody knew how ever under the authority of the speaker who was so good as to furnish me with a room in his house to make the compari sons in I at last discovered this valuable original in the very safe keeping of ARTHUR BENSON Esq Clerk of the Journals and Papers and which I believe had never seen the light for fiveandthirty years before It is a brass rod or bar about 3o inches long and i inch square inclosed in a mahogany frame inscribed  Standard  1758 at each extremity of it is Geo 2d a gold pin of about 0 inch in diameter with a central point and these points are distant  36 inches It bears however no divisions but there was found with it in another box a scale divided into 36 inches with brass cocks at the extremities for the purpose of sizing or gauging other scales or rules by Besides these I found another standard in size and in all re spects similar to the last inscribed 1760 having been made for another committee that sat in that year this also was accomm panied with a similar divided scale of 36 inches These bars being too thick to be conveniently placed under the microscopes of my instrument the interval of 36 stan dard inches was laid down on my scale with a beamcompass two fine points made and compared with TROUGHTONS di visions was 36ooo23 inches the thermometer being at 640 I then examined the other standard marked  Standard 1 76oto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 171 and found it to agree exactly with that of 1758 at least it did not differ from it more than 0002 inch  9 I was now to examine the old standards kept in the Exchequer these Mr CHARLES ELLIS Deputy Chamber lain of the Tally Court at the receipt of the Exchequer was so good as to supply me with viz the standard yard of the 3oth of Eliz 1i88 and also the standard ell of the same date These are what have been constantly used and are indeed the only ones now in use for sizing measures of lengtht They are made of brass about o6 inch square and are very rudely divided indeed into halves quarters eighths and sixteenths the lines being two or three hundredths of an inch broad and not all of them drawn square or at right angles to the sides of the bar so that no accuracy could possibly be expected from such measures However the middle point of these transverse lines between the sides of the bar was taken as the intended original division and these divisions such as they were were transferred by a dividing knife to the reverse side of my brass scale made by Mr TROUGHTON the thermometer be ing at 630 and at my leisure afterwards I found as follows The ends of these venerable standards having been bruised a little or rounded in the course of so many years usage I conceived a tangent to be drawn to the most prominent part which was about the centre or axis of the bar and this point  These quantities then being so small I shall consider them as wholly insensible and shall say that Mr BIRDS parliamentary standards of 3 feet exactly correspond with Mr TROUGIATONs scale t There was also a standard yard of Henry VII but of very rude workmanship indeed now quite laid by and at what time last used no

above table that the an cient standards of the realm differ very little from those that hbave been made by Mr BIRD or Mr TROUGHTON and conse quently even in a finance view if one might look so far for ward nothing need be apprehended of loss in the customs or excise duties by the adoption of the latterto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 173  41 I shall now endeavour to shew the proportion of the weights that I have used compared with the standards that were made by Mr HARRIS Assay Master of the Mint under the orders of the House of Commons in the year 1758 They are kept in the same custody with Mr BIRDS scales of length and appear to have been made with great care as a mean re sult from a great number of comparisons of the old weights in the Exchequer which have been detailed at length in that re port Mr HARRIS having been of opinion that the Troy pound was the best integer to adopt as the standard of weight I ven ture to conclude that this was the most accurate and most to be depended upon of all the various weights and duplicates that he made for the use of this committee for he made them of I 2 4 8 16 lb and of 4 1 2 3 6 ounces It will there fore be sufficient for my purpose to compare the 1 and 2 pounds Troy and their duplicates with the weights of Mr TROUGH TON I did this June 2d 1797 the barometer being at 2972 inches and thermometer 67g TROUGHTON S weights The

too light by 76 o65692 grain on ooo grains or i in 152392 grains  42 In conclusion it appears then that the difference of the length of two pendulums such as Mr WHITEHURST used vibrating 42 and 84 times in a minute of mean time in the la titude of London at 113 feet above the level of the sea in the temperature of 6o0 and the barometer at So inches isf989358 inches of the parliamentary standard from whence all the mea sures of superficies and capacity are deducible That agreeably to the same scale of inches a cubic inch of pire distilled water when the barometer is 2974 inches andto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 175 thermometer at 66 weighs 252422 parliamentary grains from whence all the other weights may be derived As a summary of what has been done I hope it may now be said that we have attained these three objects 1st An invariable and at all times communicable measure of Mr BIRDs scale of length now preserved in the House of Commons which is the same or agrees within an insensible quantity with the ancient standards of the realm 2dly A standard weight of the same character with reference to Mr HARRIss Troy pound Sdly Besides the quality of their being invariable without detection and at all times communicable these standards will have the additional property of introducing the least possible deviation from ancient practice or inconvenience in modern use  43 Before I close this Paper after having said so much on the subject of weights and measures it may not be impro per to add a few words upon a topic that although not imme diately connected has some affinity to it I mean the subject of the prices of provisions and of the necessaries of life c at different periods of our history and in consequence the de preciation of money Several authors have touched inciden tally upon this question and some few have written professedly upon it but they do not appear to me to have drawn a distinct conclusion from their own documents It would carry me in finitely too wide to give a detail of all the facts I have collected I shall therefore content myself with a general table of their  The various changes that have taken place by authority in different reigns either in the weight or alloy of our coins are allowed for in the subsequent table176 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours results deduced from taking a mean rate of the price of each article at the particular periods and afterwards combining these means to obtain a general mean for the depreciation at that period and lastly by interpolation reducing the whole

in England from the Year IOOO tO 1765 by Mr COMBRUNE tTs Political Economy  and Dr HENRYS Historyto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 177 APPENDIX  44 Since the writing of the preceding Memoir I have had an opportunity of examining three other scales divided into inches or equal parts of considerable authority in this country having been executed by the late Mr J BIRD I have also compared the old standard in the Exchequer of the time of Hen VII and which is considered to be the most ancient authority of this sort now subsisting these observations I flatter myself the Royal Society will be desirous of possessing  4 The firstd of the abovementioned scales belonged to the late General Roy and was purchased by him at Mr SHORTS sale the celebrated optician it was used by him in his operations of measuring a base line on Hounslow Heath See Phil Trans Vol LXXV It was originally the property of Mr G GRAHAM has the name of JONATHAN SISSON en graven upon it but is known to have been divided by Mr BIRD who then worked with old Mr SISSON It is 42 inches long divided into tenths with a vernier of loo at one end and of Wo at the other giving the subdivisions of tooths and X ocoths of an inch 4 ij The second is in the possession of ALEXANDER AUBERT Esq and formerly belonged to Mr HARRIS of the Tower contains 6o inches divided into ioths with a vernier like that of the preceding It is one inch broad and o2 thick  47 The third was presented by ALEXANDER AUBERT Esq and the late Admiral CAMPBELL Mr BIRDs executors to the Royal Society in whose custody it now remains It con sists of a brass rod 924 inches long 057 inch broad and MDCCXCVIII A a178 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS Endeavours 03 inch thick bearing a scale of go inches or equal parts each subdivided into lo with a vernier at the commencement being a scale of lco divisions to iol tenths This has been called Mr BIRDS own scale viz made for his own use and was the instrument with which he is said to have laid off the divisions of his 8feet mural quadrants It is probable that Mr BIRD made many more of these scales now in the hands of private persons one of which indeed I saw at the Presi dent DE SARONS many years ago at Paris but those have not come to my knowledge  48 In comparing General Roys BIRDS scale with Mr TROUGHTONS I found 42 inches of the former were 4200010 inches on TRoUGHTONS the thermometer 5107 36 inches were consequently  36ooco8 And 12 inches on the ist foot were equal Inches to the 12 inches from 12 to 24 on h0003119997 TROUGHTONS scale   J The 2d foot     oooG 120006 The 3d foot     0004 119996 The last foot    ooo6 120006 The mean foot therefore in General Roys scale taken from four different feet compared with I TROUGHTONS between the 12th and 24th inch 1200012 is as 12 to J That is General Roys scale is longest on 1 foot by so much and longer on 3 feet by   00036 And the greatest probable error from the inequality in the divisions is about    ooo And the mean probable error about   0003  49 Mr AUBERTS scale compared with Mr TROUGH TONS was as follows  58 inches were equal to 579982 inchesto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 179 on TROUGHTONS thermometer at 510O viz Mr BIRDS measure was shortest oo0 S or shortest on 36 inches 0012 And 12 inches or 1st foot on Mr Irlches l on Mr TROUGH AUBERTS   119999 T  P I TONS scale from 2dtoot 12C005 I 6 inches to i8 3d foot 11 9996 inches  the ther 4th foot 120019 mometer being at 5th foot 120006 50 0ngt Therefore the mean foot is  12o0005 o o The greatest error in this scale appears to be about0012 And the mean probable error    ooQ6  so The Royal Societys scale compared was as follows 58 inches on Mr BIRDS were equal to 5799912 inches on Mr  TROUGHTONS thermometer 5s5 viz Mr BIRDS measure was shortest ooo88 Or shorter on 36 inches   00054 32 inches on the same were equal to  3199967 viz Mr BIRDS was shortest by  00033 Or on 36 inches by   o0037 The mean of these two comparisons is 00045 And by so much is Mr BIRDS scale shorter in three feet than TROUGHTONS And 12 inches or ist foot of the Inches 1 Royal Societys scale is  1200013 2d foot of ditto  1199957 on TROUGH 3d foot of ditto  1200027 TONS scale 4th foot of ditto  1199990o the thermo 5th foot of ditto  1200063 meter at 510 6th foot of ditto  11998293 7th foot of ditto  1200000J The mean of these seven feet is  1199982 And the greatest error in these divisions  ooo8 And the mean probable error  ooo0 Aa 21 8o Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN s Endeavours  si Lest however it should be suspected that Mr TROUGHTONS scale with which I have made these comparisons is not sufficiently correct for this apparent preference I will now give the result of my examination of that scale from one end to the other I set the microscopes to an interval of nearly 6 inches correctly speaking it was 66oo13 inches taken from a mean of the whole scale and comparing this interval suc cessively I found as follows Error or differenct Inches Inches Inches from the mean Viz from o to 6  6ooo25  00012 6 to 12   600013  o00000o 12 to 18   600020 o   00007 i8 to 2  6ooooo  ooo1 24 to 30  600007   3So to 36  6ooo33  00020 36

mistake in Mr TROUGHTONS divisions is  00033 inch against which the chance is 9 to 1 and It is not pretended that in this and the foregoing observations the quantity of any interval can be determined to the precision of the one hundred thousandth part of an inch but it is presumed that with the assistance of the microscopes the ten thou sandth part of an inch becomes visible and as a mean is taken from 5 or 4 times reading off the micrometer at each trial it has been deemed not unreasonable to set down the quantities to five places of decimalsto ascertain a Standard of Weight and Measure 18i the mean probable error  oooi 6 and that it is 4 to 1 the error doth not exceed  inch This accuracy is about three times as great as that of Mr BIRDS scales and about equal to that of the divisions of my equatorial instrument made by Mr RAMSDEN in 1791 See Phil Trans for 1793  52 I now proceed to the examination of the standard rod of Henry VII which is an octangular brass bar of about 1 an inch in diameter with one of the sides rudely divided into halves thirds quarters eighths and sixteenths and the first foot into inches Each end is sealed with a crowned old Eng lish H u and from hence is concluded to be of the time of King Henry VII viz about 149o but is now become wholly obsolete since the introduction of the standard of Queen Elizabeth but such as it is I have thought proper to examine it and find as follows Inches On this rod j or the ist foot is equal to 1 1973 on TROUGHTONS the2d foot is  11948 the 3d foot is  12047 Erroror differene Difference on 3 feet The mean foot is

Entire yard or 36 inches  35966 034 034 And the mean yard  35924 Mean o76 And by so much Mr TROUGHTONS measure is longest182 Sir GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNs Endeavours c And the probable error in the divisions of this old standard is about   inch  Sj It may now be desirable to see the comparative lengths of these various standards and scales reduced to one and the same measure viz Mr TROUGHTONS Inches on Diffe Probable error 36 inches on a mean of HenVII standard Troughtons rence in divisions of 1490 are equal to  35924 076 03 of standard yard of Eliz of i 588 36o15  015 04 of standard ell

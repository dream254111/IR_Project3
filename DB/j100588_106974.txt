J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106974,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ENDEAVOURS TO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE BY SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN BART F R S AND A S,I206953,VIII AN ACCOUNT OF SOME ENDEAVOURS TO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGBT AND MEASURE BY SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN BART FRS AND AS READ FEBRUARY 22 1799  1 HAVING FOR SOME YEARS TURNED MY THOUGHTS TO THE CONSIDERA TION OF AN INVARIABLE AND IMPERISHABLE STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE AS BEING A THING IN A PHILOSOPHICAL VIEW HIGHLY DE SIRABLE AND LIKELY TO BECOME EXTREMELY BENEFICIAL TO THE PUBLIC I HAD SO EARLY AS THE YEAR I78O TAKEN UP THE IDEA OF AN UNI VERSAL MEASURE FROM WHENCE ALL THE REST MIGHT BE DERIVED BY MEANS OF A PENDULUM WITH A MOVEABLE CENTRE OF SUSPENSION CAPABLE OF SUCH ADJUSTMENTS AS TO BE MADE TO VIBRATE ANY NUM BER OF TIMES IN A GIVEN INTERVAL AND BY COMPARISON OF THE DFFERENCE OF THE VIBRATIONS WITH THE DIFERENCE OF THE LENGTHS OF THE PENDULUM WHICH DIFFERENCE ALONE MIGHT BE THE STANDARD MEASURE TO DETERMINE ITS POSITIVE LENGTH IF THAT SHOULD BE THOUGHT PREFERABLE UNDER ANY GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCES BY WHICH MEANS ALL THE DIFFICULTIES ARISING IN DETERMINING THE ACTUAL CENTRE OF MOTION AND OF OSCILLATION WHICH HAVE HITHERTO SO MUCH EMBARRASSED THESE EXPERIMENTS WOULD BE GOTTEN OVER 2  I MADE SEVERAL COMPUTATIONS OF THE PROBABLE ACCURACY THAT MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH AN EXPERIMENT AND WAS SA TISFIED WITH THEIR RESULT BUT NOT SEEING CLEARLY HOW SUCH A PENDULUM COULD BE CONNECTED TO A PIECE OF MECHANISM TA13 SIR GEORGE SHUCKNBUNH EVELYNS ENDEAVOURS NUMBER THE VIBRATIONS WITHOUT AFFECTING THEM I DROPPED THE IDEA FOR THAT TIME I LEARNT HOWEVER SOME TIME AFTERWARDS THAT MR JOHN WHIT9HR4S A VERY INIOUS PERSON HAD BEEN IN PURSUIT OF THE SAME OBJECT WITH BETTER SUCCESS ANDHAD CON TRIVED A MACHINE FULLY CORRESPONDING TO HIS EXPECTATIONS AND MY WISHES THIS HE AFTERWARDS EXPLAINED TO THE WORLD IN A PAMPHLET ENTITLED AN ATTEMPT TO OBTAIN MEASURES OF LENGTH C FROM THE MENSURATION OF TIME OR THE TRUE LEN GTH OF PENDULUMS PUBLISHED IN 1787 MR WHITEHURST HAVING THEREIN DONE ALL THAT RELATED TO THE STANDARD MEASURE OF LENGTH AND SUGGESTED THAT OF WEIGHT IT APPEARED TO ME THA IT REMAINED ONLY TO YERIFY AND COMPLETE HIS EXPERIMENTS  3 FOR THIS PURPOSE BY THE KIND ASSISTANCE OF MY FRIEND DR G FORDYCE WHO AT MR WHITEHURSTS DEATH HAD LUR CHASED HIS APPARATUS I WAS FURNISHED WITH THE VERY MACHINE WITH WHICH MR WHITEIURST HAD MADE HIS OBSERVATIONS I ALSO PROCURED TO BE MADE BY MR TROUGHTON A VERY EXCELLENT BEAMCOMPASS OR DIVIDED SCALEFURNISHED WITH MICROSCOPES AND MICROMETER FOR THE MOST EXACT OBSERVATIONS OFLONGITUDINAL MEA SURE AS ALSO A VERY NICE BEAM OR HYDROSTATIC BALANCE SENSIBLE WITH THE RI OF A GRAIN WHEN LOADED WITH 61B TROY AT EACH END MR ARNOLD MADE ME ONE OF HIS ADMIRABLE TIMEKEEPERS IN ORDER TO CARRY TIME FROM MY SIDEREAL REGULATOR IN MY BSER VATORY WITH WHICH IT WAS ADJUSTED TO THE ROOM WHEREIN I HAD FIXED MR WHITEHURSTS PENDULUM AND WHO HAVING TAKEN A JOURNEY FROM LONDON INTO WARWICKSHIRE WAS SO GOOD AS TO ASSIST IN THE BEGINNING OF THESE EXPERIMENTS THUS EQUIPPED I WENT TO WORK IN THE LATTER END OF AUGUST 1796 WHEN THE TEMPERATURE WAS ABOUT 6O0 FIRST TO EXAMINE THE LENGTH OF THE PENDULUM WHEN TO MY GREAT MORTIFICATION I FOUND THAT THETO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE I THIN WIRE OF WHICH THE ROD CONSISTED WAS TOO WEAK TO SUPPORT THE BALL IN A STATE OF VIBRATION AND THAT AFTER 15 OR 2 HOURS ACTION IT REPATEDLY BROKE THE SAME MISFORTUNE ATTENDED MY TRIALS WITH THREE OTHE DIFFERENT SORTS OF WIRES THAT I HAD OBTAINED FROM LONDON WHETHER THIS ACCIDENT HAPPENED FROM ANY RUST IN THE OLD WIRE OR FROM WANT OF DUE TEMPER IN THE NEW OR FROM ITS BEING TOO MUCH PINCHED BETWEEN THE CHEEKS I CANNOT TELL I CAND ONLY OBSERVE THAT ALL THE WIRES THAT I USED WERE CON SIDERABLY HEAVIER AND THEREFORE PROBABLY STRONGER THAN WHAT MR WIITEH URST MENTIONS VIZ GRAINS IN WEIGHT FOR8O INCHES IN LENGTH NAY MINE PROCEEDED AS FAR AS FROM TO 6 GRAINS  FOR THAT LENGTH AND YET I COULD NEVER GET IT TO SUPPORT THE BALL DURING THE WHOLE PERIOD OF MY EXPERIMENT THIS BEING THE CASEAND BEING IN THE COUNTRY FAR REMOVED FROM THE MANUFICTORY OF THIS LINE WIRE I WAS RELUCTANTLY COMPELLEDTO RELINQUISH THIS PART OF THE OPERATION TO SOME MORE FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY IN THE MEAN WHILE HOWEVER I THOUGHT IT DESIRABLE TO MEASURE THE DIF FERENCE OF THE LENGTHS OF MR WHITEHURSTS PENDULUM FROM HIS OWN OBSERVATIONS OR VERY FORTUNATELY THE MARKS THAT HE HAD MADE ON THE BRASS VERTICAL RULER OF HIS MACHINE WERE STILL VISIBLE AND THIS INTERVAL WHICH HE CALLS  59892 INCHES I DETERMINED ON MY DIVIDED SCALE MADE BY TROUGHTON FROM MKR BIRDS STANDARD TO BE  989358 INCHES FROM A MEAN OF FOUR DIFFERENT TRIALS IN THE TEMPERATURE OF 64 THAT MEAFRDIFFER ING FROM THE EXTREMES ONLY OOO INCH  4 BY THIS EXAMINATION IF I HAVE NOT VERIFIED I HAVE AT LEAST PRESERVED MR WHITEURSTS STANDARD AND FOR THE PRESENT I SHALL CONSIDER THIS MEASURE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LENGTH OF THE TWO PENDULUMS VIBRATING 42 AND 84 TIMES IN A  CC FIG I OF PLATE II IN MR WHITEHURSTINS PAMPHLET136 SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYNS ENDEAVOURS MINUTE OF MEAN TIME AS CORRECT ON THIS PRESUMPTION I SHALL PROCEED TO THE EXAMINATION OF WEIGHT    FROM THE OPINION OF DIFFERENT SKILFUL PERSONS WITH WHOM I HAVE CONFERRED AS WELL AS FROM THE RESULT OF MY OWN CONSIDERATIONS I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE THERE IS HARDLY ANY BODY IN NATURE WITH WHICH WE ARE FAMILIARLY ACQUAINTED THAT IS OF SO SIMPLE AND HOMOGENEOUS A QUALITY AS PURE DISTILLED WATER OR SO FIT FOR THE PURPOSES OF THIS INQUIRY AND I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IF THE WEIGHT OF ANY QUANTITY OF WATER WHOSE BULK HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MEASURED BY THE ABOVEMENTIONED SCALE COULD BE OBTAINED UNDER A KNOWN PRESSURE AND TEMPERATURE OF THE AT MOSPHERE WE SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF A GENERAL STANDARD OF WEIGHT  6 WITH THIS VIEW I DIRECTED MR TROUGHTON TO MAKE IN ADDITION TO THE VERY SENSIBLE HYDROSTATIC BALANCE BEFORE MEN TIONED A SOLID CUBE OF BRASS WHOSE SIDES WERE 5 INCHES AND ALSO A CYLINDER OF THE SAME METAL 4 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND 6 HIGH FROM ST THOMASS HOSPITAL BY THE FAVOUR OF DR FOR DYCE I PROCURED 3 GALLONS OF DISTILLED WATER WITH THESE I MADE THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS BUT BEFORE I RELATE THE EX PERIMENTS I WILL DESCRIBE THE APPARATUS MR WHITEHURSTS MACHINE FOR MEASURING THE PENDULUM HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EXPLAINED IN HIS PAMPHLET MENTIONED ABOVE MY DIVIDED SCALE WHICH WAS A NEW INSTRUMENT WAS AS FOLLOWS V I DO NOT HERE MEAN TO INFER ANY OPINION RESPECTING THE COMPRESSIBILITY OF WATER BUT ONLY TO SAY THAT WHERE WATER OR ANY THING ELSE IS WEIGHED IN AIR THE DENSITY OF THAT MEDIUM AS SHEWNWBY THE BAROMETER AND THERMOMETER MUST BE KNOWN IN ORDER TO MAKE ALLOWANCES FOR IT IF NECESSARYTO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE 1I7  7 DESCRIOPTION OF THE BEAM COMPASS OR DIVIDED SCALE OF EQUAL PARTS A B TAB V FIG I IS A BLOCK OR BEAM OF MAHOGANY 6

BY THE FINGERSCREWS C E D AND IS FURNISHED WITH VERY FINE HAIRLINE DIVISIONS INTENDED TO BE VIEWED ONLY BY THE MICROSCOPES H I THE LATTER CALLED THE BEAM HAS NO MOTION BUT BY MEANS OF THE SCREW G AND BEARS STRONGER DIVISIONS UPON IT WITH WHICH THE SLIDING PIECES OR INS DEXES AT K AND M MAY READILY BE COMPARED BY THE NAKED EYE AND IS INTENDED ONLY TO SET THE MICROSCOPES OR RATHER THE WIRES IN THEIR FOCUS TO THE REQUIRED DISTANCE NEARLY VIZ TO WITHIN I O OR L OF AN INCH THE MICROSCOPES ARE COMPOUND AND SIMILAR TO THOSE DESCRIBED BY THE LATE GEHERAL ROY IN HIS ACCOUNT OF HIS LARGE THEODOLITE SEE PHIL TRANS VOL LXXX THE ONE AT H CONTAINS ONLY CROSS WIRES FIXED IN ITS FOCUS THE OTHER AT I HAS A MICROMETER ALSO BY MEANS OF WHICH ITS CROSS WIRES MAY BE MOVED TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT OVER THE IMAGE OF THE DIVI SIONS OF THE SCALE ANY GIVEN SPACE NOT EXCEEDING I INCH AND THE QUANTITY SO MOVED MAY BE MEASURED BY THE DIVISIONS ON THE SCREW HEAD PASSING UNDER THE INDEX AT V THE DIVISIONS ON THESE RULES HAVE BEEN CALLED INCHES AND TENTHS IT WAS NOT NECESSARY THAT THEY SHOULD BE MORE THAN EQSUAL PARTS BUT THEY WERE IN FACT LAID DOWN BY MR TROUGHTON FROM A SCALE OF THE LATE EXCELLENT ARTIST MR J BIRD WHO HAD DIVIDED INTO INCHES SEVERAL SCALES OF DIFFERENT LENGTHS ONE OF WHICH 42 INCHES LONG BELONGED TO THE LATE GENERAL ROY A SECOND OF 5 FEET WAS PURCHASED BY ALEXANDER AUBERT ESQ AND A THIRD OF MDCCXCVIII T138 SIR GEORGE SHUCKBUR GH EVELYNS ENDEAVOURS GO INCHES WHICH IS NOW THE PROPERTY OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY IS KEPT IN THEIR ARCHIVES AND IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN USED BY MR BIRD IN DIVIDING HIS LARGE MURAL QUADRANTS BESIDES THESE HE MADE TWO STANDARDS OF THREE FEET BY ORDER OF THE HOUSE OF COMMONS OF WHICH I SHALL SPEAK MORE HEREAFTER THE MODE OF USING THIS INSTRUMENT IS AS FOLLOWS  8 LET THE OBJECT TO BE MEASURED BE SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT SIX INCHES AND LET IT BE DESIRED TO COMPARE IT WITH THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE 20TH AND THE 26TH DIVISION ON THE SCALE C D MOVE BY HAND THE MICROSCOPE H WITH ITS SLIDING PLATE UNTIL THE DIVISION OF THE INDEX AT K COINCIDE WITH THE DIVISION OF 20 INCHES ON THE RULEFG THEN MOVE BY HAND ALSO THE MICROSCOPE I WITH ITS SLIDING PLATE AND APPENDAGE I M N O UNTIL THE INDEX DIVISION NEAR M COINCIDE WITH 26 INCHES ONFG THE AXES OF THE MICRO SCOPES OR CENTRES OF THEIR CROSS WIRES WILL BE AT THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE OF 6 INCHLES T O CORRECT THIS EXAMINE IF THE WIRES OF B CORRESPOND WITH A DIVISION ON C D IF NOT MOVE THE RULE FG BACKWARD OR FORWVARD BY THE SCRW G TILL THEY DO THEN WILL THE MICROSCOPE H BE ADJUSTED NOW EXAMINE IF THE WIRES IN A COVER EXACTLY A DIVISION IF THEY DO SO THE TRUE INTERVAL OF 6 INCHES BETWEEN THE MICROSCOPES IS OBTAINED IF NOT MOVE THE MICROSCOPE I A LITTLE BY MEANS OF THE SCREW 1 TILL THEY DO AND BOTH THE MICROSCOPES WILL BE ADJUSTED  THEN REMOVE THE RULE C E D FROM ITS PLACE BY TAKING OUT THE SCREWS C E D AND PLACE THE OBJECT TO BE MEASURED IN ITS ROOM AT THE SAME TIME TAKING CARE THAT IT BE EXACTLY IN THE FOCUS OF THE OBJECT GLASS OF THE MICROSCOPE IN SUCH MANNER THAT ONE EXTREMITY MAY COR RESPOND WITH THE WIRES IN THE MICROSCOPE B THAT DONE IF THE OTHER EXTREMITY COINCIDE WITH THE WIRES IN I THE DIMENSION OF THE OBJECT IS EXACTLY 6 INCHES IF NOT RESTORE THE COINCIDENCES  A FARTHER ACCOUNT OF THESE SCALES IS GIVEN IN THE APPENDIXTO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE I  BY TURNING THE MICROMETER

VERY LITTLE FRICTION AND AT THE SAME TIME SO HARD AS WITH DUE CARE IN USING TO BE IN NO DANGER OF BE ING BLUNTED TO PREVENT WHICH THE INNER PILLAR HAS A MOTION UPWARDS AS HAS BEEN SAID BY THE SCREW X AND BY MEANS OF A SEMICIRCULAR ARM AT ITS UPPER EXTREMITY LIFTS THE BEAM OFF ITS BEARINGS WHEN IT IS NOT USED OR IS GREATLY LOADED THIS AXIS IS PLACED CAREFULLY AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE BEAM AND BY MEANS OF TWO SMALL BRASS SPRINGS THAT PRESS GENTLY AT THE ENDS IS BROUGHT ALWAYS TO HAVE THE SAME BEARING UPON THE CRYSTAL SO THAT NO ERROR NEED BE FEARED FROM A SMALL DEVIATION FROM THE RGHTANGULAR POSITION OF THE AXIS TO THE BEAM SHOULD ANY SUCH T 2140 SIR GEORGE SHUCKBURGH EVELYN S ENDEAVOUSRS EXIST AND FROM ITS SHAPE AND QUALITY IT MAY BE CONSIDERED AS IN FLEXIBLE IN ANY ORDINARY EXPERIMENTS ATP IS A SMALL ADJUSTING SCREW WHICH RAISES OR DEPRESSES A WEIGHT WITHIN AND WITH IT IN CONSEQUENCE THE CENTRE OF GRAVITY OF THE WHOLE BEAM BY THIS MEANS THE MOTION ON ITS CENTRE MAY BE BROUGHT TO ALMOST ANY REQUIRED DEGREE OF SENSIBILITY SHOULD THE CENTRE OF GRA VITY BE RAISED ABOVE THE CENTRE OF MOTION THE BEAM WOULD TURN OVER IF IT BE IN THAT CENTRE THE BEAM WOULD STAND ANY WHERE INDIFFERENTLY WITHOUT ANY VIBRATION IF IT BE PLACED MUCH BELOW IT THE VIBRATION WOULD BE TOO QUICK AND ITS SENSIBILITY NOT SUFFI CIENT IT IS THEREFORE BROUGHT BY THE SCREWP A VERY SMALL QUAN TITY BELOW THE CENTRE OF MOTION SO AS TO DESCRIBE ONE VIBRATION IN 40 OR 5O SECONDS THE SENSIBILITY IS THEN FULLY SUFFICIENT AT EACH END OF THE BEAM ARE CIRCULAR BOXES N AND O THROUGH WHICH PASS THE STEEL

PURPOSE OF SIZING OR GAUGING OTHER SCALES OR RULES BY BESIDES THESE I FOUND ANOTHER STANDARD IN SIZE AND IN ALL RE SPECTS SIMILAR TO THE LAST INSCRIBED 1760 HAVING BEEN MADE FOR ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT SAT IN THAT YEAR THIS ALSO WAS ACCOMM PANIED WITH A SIMILAR DIVIDED SCALE OF 36 INCHES THESE BARS BEING TOO THICK TO BE CONVENIENTLY PLACED UNDER THE MICROSCOPES OF MY INSTRUMENT THE INTERVAL OF 36

RIGHT ANGLES TO THE SIDES OF THE BAR SO THAT NO ACCURACY COULD POSSIBLY BE EXPECTED FROM SUCH MEASURES HOWEVER THE MIDDLE POINT OF THESE TRANSVERSE LINES BETWEEN THE SIDES OF THE BAR WAS TAKEN AS THE INTENDED ORIGINAL DIVISION AND THESE DIVISIONS SUCH AS THEY WERE WERE TRANSFERRED BY A DIVIDING KNIFE TO THE REVERSE SIDE OF MY BRASS SCALE MADE BY MR TROUGHTON THE THERMOMETER BE ING AT 630 AND AT MY LEISURE AFTERWARDS I FOUND AS FOLLOWS THE ENDS OF THESE VENERABLE STANDARDS HAVING BEEN BRUISED A LITTLE OR ROUNDED IN THE COURSE OF SO MANY YEARS USAGE I CONCEIVED A TANGENT TO BE DRAWN TO THE MOST

CUSTODY WITH MR BIRDS SCALES OF LENGTH AND APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN MADE WITH GREAT CARE AS A MEAN RE SULT FROM A GREAT NUMBER OF COMPARISONS OF THE OLD WEIGHTS IN THE EXCHEQUER WHICH HAVE BEEN DETAILED AT

MICROSCOPES TO AN INTERVAL OF NEARLY 6 INCHES CORRECTLY SPEAKING IT WAS 66OO13 INCHES TAKEN FROM A MEAN OF THE WHOLE SCALE AND COMPARING THIS INTERVAL SUC CESSIVELY I FOUND AS FOLLOWS ERROR OR DIFFERENCT INCHES INCHES INCHES FROM THE MEAN VIZ FROM O TO 6  6OOO25  00012 6 TO 12   600013  O00000O 12 TO 18   600020 O   00007 I8 TO 2  6OOOOO  OOO1 24 TO 30  600007   3SO TO 36  6OOO33  00020 36

MISTAKE IN MR TROUGHTONS DIVISIONS IS  00033 INCH AGAINST WHICH THE CHANCE IS 9 TO 1 AND IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT IN THIS AND THE FOREGOING OBSERVATIONS THE QUANTITY OF ANY INTERVAL CAN BE DETERMINED TO THE PRECISION OF THE ONE HUNDRED THOUSANDTH PART OF AN INCH BUT IT IS PRESUMED THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE MICROSCOPES THE TEN THOU SANDTH PART OF AN INCH BECOMES VISIBLE AND AS A MEAN IS TAKEN FROM 5 OR 4 TIMES READING OFF THE MICROMETER AT EACH TRIAL IT HAS BEEN DEEMED NOT UNREASONABLE TO SET DOWN THE QUANTITIES TO FIVE PLACES OF DECIMALSTO ASCERTAIN A STANDARD OF WEIGHT AND MEASURE 18I THE MEAN PROBABLE ERROR  OOOI 6 AND THAT IT IS 4 TO 1 THE ERROR DOTH NOT EXCEED  INCH THIS ACCURACY IS ABOUT THREE TIMES AS GREAT AS THAT OF MR BIRDS SCALES AND ABOUT EQUAL TO THAT OF THE DIVISIONS OF MY EQUATORIAL INSTRUMENT MADE BY MR RAMSDEN IN 1791 SEE PHIL TRANS FOR 1793  52 I NOW PROCEED TO THE EXAMINATION OF THE STANDARD ROD OF HENRY VII WHICH IS AN OCTANGULAR BRASS BAR OF ABOUT 1 AN INCH IN DIAMETER WITH ONE OF THE SIDES RUDELY DIVIDED INTO HALVES THIRDS QUARTERS EIGHTHS AND SIXTEENTHS AND THE FIRST FOOT INTO INCHES EACH END IS SEALED WITH A CROWNED OLD ENG LISH H U AND FROM HENCE IS CONCLUDED TO BE OF THE TIME OF KING HENRY VII VIZ ABOUT 149O BUT IS NOW BECOME WHOLLY OBSOLETE SINCE THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STANDARD OF QUEEN ELIZABETH BUT SUCH AS IT IS I HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO EXAMINE IT AND FIND AS FOLLOWS INCHES ON THIS ROD J OR THE IST FOOT IS EQUAL TO 1 1973 ON TROUGHTONS THE2D FOOT IS  11948 THE 3D FOOT IS  12047 ERROROR DIFFERENE DIFFERENCE ON 3 FEET THE MEAN FOOT IS

defendant as a side collision with a vehicle the courts have divided Hooughton v Market Street Ry 1905 1 Cal App 576 for its application contra Chicago City Ry v Rood 1896 163 Ill 477 45 N E 238 An earlier New York case held that the principle did not apply distinguishing a side from a headon collision Alexander v R C  B R R 1891 128 N Y 13 27 N E 950 The carrier is not an insurer of the safety of its passengers Grand Rapids  Indiana R R v Huntley 1878 38 Mich 537 Negligence of the defendant is thus a necessary element in the pIaintiffs case From the facts of the instant case the probability of negligence is not apparent nor is there any knowledge as to the cause of the injury peculiar to the defendant As the reasons for the application of the doc trine are not present therefore it would seem that the maxim should not apply PRINCIPAL AND AGENTUNDISCLOSED PRINCIPALSTATUTE OF FRAUDSThe par ties entered into an oral contract for 6500 bushels of wheat The plaintiff had 2400 bushels of his own and was agent for two undisclosed principals for the re mainder The purchaser paid 100 as part payment on the purchase price and la ter refused to accept the wheat In a suit on the contract held the plaintiff could recover only for 2400 bushels since the part payment only took the contract to sell his own wheat out of the Statute of Frauds King v Farmter Grain Co of Dawson Iowa 1922 188 N W 720 An undisclosed principal can sue on contracts made by his agents for him Planters Gin Co v Pitts Banking Co 1920 24 Ga App 731 102 S E 183 Kelly Block Co v BarberPage  Co 1914 211 N Y 68 105 N E 88 If there are two or more undisclosed principals they cannot maintain separate actions on an entire contract Mridwood Sons Co v Alaska Portland Packing Co 1907 28 R I 303 67 Atl 61 Roosevelt v Doherty 1880 129 Mass 301 This rule is based on a desire to protect third persons from a multiplicity of suits See Roose velt v Doherty supra 35 But where the principals have prosecuted separate ac tions to judgment the defendant cannot object to this for the first time on an appeal St Louis R R v Thatcher 1874 13 Kan 564 An agent for an un disclosed principal may recover for the whole contract B1ff1igton v McNally 1906 192 Mass 198 78 N E 309 though there is more than one principal Tue son Fruit Co v Earl Frtit Co 1898 53 Pac 693 695 or the agent himself shares an interest in the contract with an undisclosed principal Stack v Gutdgel 1916 60 Okla 32 158 Pac 1144 In an action by the plaintiff on a contract made in his own name it is immaterial that he acted for an undisclosed principal See Wright v Seattle Grocery Co 1919 177 Pac 818 822 But for the Statute of Frauds the plaintiff could therefore have recovered for all the wheat The defendant intended to contract with the plaintiff for the full amount of the wheat he knew no one else The part payment was made on the entire transaction regarded as a unit It is difficult therefore to see why the part payment to the plaintiff did not take the whole contract out of the Statute of Frauds REAI  PROPERTYRAILROAD RIGHT OF WAYADVERSE POSSESSIONIn 1890 the defendant granted to the plaintiff a railroad right of way over his farm land to be fifty feet on each side of the centre line of the railroad The defendant built fences twentyfive feet from the centre line on each side and used the fifty feet of land so fenced off for agricultural purposes The plaintiff had no use for the land used by the defendant In 1917 or 1918 the plaintiff was informed that the defendant denied the plaintiffs right of way In 1919 the railroad brought this action of ejectment Held the plaintiffs action was not barred semble had the defendant used the land for the full prescriptive period afterCOLUMBIA LAW REVIEW notice to the plaintiff that he denied its right the action would have been barred Seaboard Air Line Ry v Banks et al Ala 1922 91 So 380 A railroad right of way is more than a mere easement and includes the actual possession or right to actual possession of the entire surface for every proper use and purpose in the construction and operation of the road See Sadler v Alabama Great Soutthern R R 1920 204 Ala 155 157 85 So 380 The railroad has the right to exclusive possession and may exclude the owner of the fee if necessary for the operation of the road See Jackson v Rutland  Burlington R R 1853 25 Vt 150 159 However use of the land by the grantor in a manner which does not interfere with its use as a railroad right of way is not adverse possession since the grantee cannot exclude him from such use except for the purposes of the grant Alabama Great Souctern R R v McWhorter 1919 202 Ala 455 80 So 839 Possession to be adverse must not only be under claim of right but hostile to and inconsistent with the rights of the owner Salt Lake Investment Co v Fox 1907 32 Utah 301 90 Pac 564 A railroad right of way cannot be lost by prescriptive use or adverse pos session except by the erection of a permanent structure accompanied by notice to the railroad company of an intention to claim adversely to its right See Atlanta  Charlotte Air Line Ry v Limestone Globe Land Company et al 1917 109 S C 444 451 96 S E 188 The defendants possession was not in consistent with the plaintiffs possession or right to possession It is difficult to see how a mere assertion that the defendant denied the plaintiffs right could make an otherwise rightful possession adverse REPLEVINMEASURE OE DAMAGES FOR DEENTIONThe plaintiff brought replevin to recover an automobile used by the plaintiff in the taxicab business and unlaw fully detained by the defendants without use for sixteen months On appeal from a judgment declaring the measure of damages to be the reasonable value of the use of the car while wrongfuly detained held judgment reversed The true measure of damages is the net usable value of the car less the depreciation which would have ensued from its use during the period of detention Puckett v Hop kins Mont 1922 206 Pac 422 It is the ordinary rule in replevin that the damages are to be measured by the legal interest on the money value of the article vrongfully withheld this rule is applicable where the plaintiff had no intention to use the property for profitable purposes Smith v Stevens 1900 14 Colo App 491 60 Pac 580 However it may happen as in the principal case that the chattel has a usable value in excess of the legal rate of interest Such usable value will then be denominated the proper measure of damages Los Angeles Furniture Co v Hansen 1920 31 Cal App 391 188 Pac 292 This rule by the weight of authority will not be applied on the basis of an articles usable value to the extent of allowing a recovery for more than the value of the thing itself in addition to its return it is generally felt that no judgment can be sustained where the damages for detention bear an unreasonable proportion to the value of the property Romberg v Hughes 1886 18 Neb 579 26 N W 351 Arnmstrong  Latta v City of Philadelphia 1915 249 Pa 39 94 Atl 455 contra Tucker v Hagerty 1918 37 Cal App 789 174 Pac 908 But where the chattel has not actually been used by the defendant and is of a kind whose value is materially lessened by use the defendant is entitled to have deducted from the usable value damages a reasonable sum for the deterioration which would have been attendant upon such use Ocala Foundry  Machtie Works v Lester  Daniels 1905 49 Fla 199 38 So 51 The instant case is a correct application of this rule which seems to be the fairest approxima 766

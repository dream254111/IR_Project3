domicile of the observer it is necessary to have portable nests The trans portation of either the Lubbock or the Janet nest is made inconvenient by the water used for the isolation of the ants in the former and by the considerable weight of the latter Six colonies can be successfully carried on journeys of several hours or days by the use of a case made of halfinch pine boards and dovetailed at the corners with a door hinged upon its lower side and held shut by two buttons at its upper edge The case measures on the inside I634 inches in length 64 inches in horizontal depth and 434 inches in height Three shelves each onefourth of an inch thick are mortised into the ends of the case making four compartments each one inch high Several holes are bored in the door of the case and in the side opposite the door to admit fresh air The case is car ried by a leather handle fastened lengthwise to its top and it is just filled by the six nests hereinafter described Of the six nests there are two of each pattern A B and C An A and a B nest together fill a shelf while a C nest fills a shelf alone The nests are all built of clear glass and their parts are readily cut by any glazier The joinings are made with Le Pages liquid glue which must thoroughly dry before the nests are used The cost of material and the amount of labor required in making these nests are much less than for either the Lubbock or the Janet pattern The floors are panes of double thick glass under which is laid a thick sheet of white blotting paper of the same size as the glass to give opacity elasticity and a background against which the ants are easily seen The blotting paper should not 8ibe fastened to the glass as the latter must sometimes be raised in order to get a view of the ants from below The walls stand half an inch from the edges of the basepane for the greater security of the superstructure when the nest is being lifted The walls are built of strips of double thick glass half an inch wide two horizontal layers in every wall giving a perfectly level top Apertures threeeighths of an inch wide are left in the walls at points marked a on the plans These apertures admit the end of a threeeighthsinch glass tube which may be used as a safe bridge between nests when ants are to be made to pass from one nest into another When not in use the apertures are closed with plugs of cotton The outside of the walls after thorough drying are painted black to secure within the nest the darkness in which ants like to keep their young The main partitions in the antdwelling take part with the walls in the support of separate roofpanes and they are there fore twice as wide as are the walls Passageways marked im on the plans permit the ants to go from one room to another as is necessary when a room is to be cleaned The admission of strong light will insure the removal of the ant family to the darkened chamber adjoining The passageways may be from onefourth to onehalf inch in width and they should be cov ered with very thin glass well glued on The tops of the walls and main partitions are exactly cov ered with coarse Turkish toweling cut in strips twice as wide as the base on which it lies and doubled so that its raw edges meet in the middle of the glass it doubly covers The under layer of the toweling is glued to the glass and it performs the double office of keeping the ants within the nest and of admit ting sufficient fresh air for their breathing Just over the pas sageways the toweling is left free so that it may there be lifted for observation of what is within After the toweling is laid on the rooms have a uniform depth of less than half an inch and a hand lens can be focused upon any of their inmates The toweling being elastic and level the roofpanes of thin clear glass lie closely upon it They are not fastened down The roofpanes reach the center of the main partitions and 82 FIELDE VOL IIPORTABLE ANT NESTS A 6 x 6 in I6 X I15 C B IO x 6 in 25 x 15 C C I6

dark blotting paper which should be lifted only when actual study of the ants is proceeding In the rooms numbered I the ants have as in the Janet nests a chance to range in the light and to seek food of which it is well to put in the smallest sufficient quantity and several kinds If the ants are made to move into the darkened food room leaving the other rooms free for cleaning the passage ways m may during the cleaning be plugged with cotton In room 3 a soft fine sponge clean and wet and less than one fourth of an inch thick should nearly cover the floor leaving a passage all around it next the walls This furnishes drink to the ants and moisture to the air of their dwelling If the ant young are in the egg or the larval stage or if the temperature is high the floor of room 2 should likewise be covered with wet sponge  but if the young are in cocoons or if the temper ature is very low then room 2 should have a layer of wadding instead of sponge The ants generally choose damp places for the eggs and larvae and dry places for the cocoons or pupae The screens marked b are substitutes for the antruns used in the ground and they gratify the disposition of the ant to keep close to cover in going about in the nest They are made in the same way as are the walls but are only onefourth of an inch thick and are not topped with toweling The A nest with base 62 x 6 inches is designed for a colony of very small ants or for a few large ants The B nest with base io x 6 inches affords a home for a somewhat larger family The C nest I62 x 6 inches can be used for a multiplying and dividing colony or for observing the activi ties of restless species The ants should never be greatly crowded in their habitation The ants in my nests appear sleek and healthy I have found these nests easier than others to keep free from the molds that grow from particles of food that the ants convey from the foodroom to every other part of their nest These nests also lend themselves readily to experimental uses in studying the instincts of their occupants 84 FIELDE VOL IINo 2 PORTABLE ANT NESTS 85 When the nests are to be carried on a journey the roofs are securely fastened down by sewing narrow strips of cheese cloth around the nest in such a way as to prevent the slipping of the roofpane The fastenings must not exclude fresh air Having fastened the roofpanes each in place the nests are put upon the appropriate shelves in the case where they may be further secured by bits of wadding above the roofpanes and at the ends of the shelves The weight of my case with its six enclosed nests packed for travel is less than fifteen pounds The strong local attach ments of the ants are undisturbed by their so journeying and at the end of the journey the study of their life processes may be speedily resumed MARINE BIOLOGICAL LABORATORY WOODS HOLL September 90oo

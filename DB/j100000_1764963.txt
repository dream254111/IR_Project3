on a windowpane which must also be in the line of the axis of the mirrors rotation into the field of view so that the aforesaid dot will appear in the centre if the mirror is directly beneath If all is properly adjusted on moving the mirrorbar to and fro the dot will always appear reflected from the centre of the mirror The angle through which the mirrorbar must be swung so that the image of the dot may be first where the apex of one branch of the hyperbola was and then where the other apex was will be the optical angle in air 2E The angle which may be swung from where the dot disappears on one side to where it disappears on the other will give the angular aperture of the objective used SUBDIVISIONS OF THE AZOIC ARCH2EAN IN NORTHERN MICHIGAN BY M E WADSWORTH STATE GEOLOGIST HOUGHTON MICH THE work of the Michigan Geological Survey in 1890 made it clear that the Azoic system of the Lake Superior district of northern Michigan was composed of at least three unconformable formations This conclusion was published by me early in 1891 in an article entitled A Sketch of the Geology of the Marquette and Keweenawan Districts which was appended to a pamphlet called Lake Superior  Along the South Shore New York 1891 These general conclusions have been confirmed by the work of the two subsequent seasons and two other unconformable forma tions rendered probable although not yet proved conclusively A discussion of these points will subsequently be given in detail in the reports of the State geologist The following are the formations as made out and named from prominent localities by the Michigan Survey commencing with the oldest There are given with this the formations as deter mined by the United States Geological Survey showing their supposed equivalency Michigan Geological

crop The corro sive sublimate treatment recommended in Bulletin No 4 of North Dakota Experiment Station has had another years trial not only at this station but by potatogrowers and it has again proven effective in a degree beyond previous expectation Though the damage done each year by this disease is so great and widespread in its occurrence no plantdisease now success fully combated is so easily prevented and at such a slight cost As indicated in my work of previous seasons it is again demon strated this past season that the damage to the yield of the crop is very much in excess of that usually supposed The disease at tacks not only the tubers but the base of the vines also the result is a shorterlived vine a greater number of potatoes set upon the vines than there would be under normal conditions and third much smaller tubers The secopd of these statements perhaps needs some explanation I have only one to offer which I think to be about the correct one ie the disease early attacks the young tubers as they set upon the vines normal growth is 355 checked and the excess of vigor in the vines which is at its highest stage at this time finds expression in the formation of new tubers to the further detriment of those already set upon the stems The results of this summers work when averaged for all tests show an average gain of onehalf pound per hill in favor of the treated seedtubers and 9933 per cent of total product void of disease while untreated seed in all cases gave a product in which less than one per cent undiseased tubers were found The cost of treatment for a crop of two or three acres of pota toes need not exceed fifty cents aside from that of one or two days extra labor Details of the seasons work will soon appear in bulletin form THE fourteenth edition of Franklin Leonard Popes Modern Practice of the Electric Telegraph has just appeared D Van Nostrand Company 234 p 8 150 This is a technical hand book for electricians managers and operators and contains 185 illustrations As this book has been a standard authority on telegraphy for almost a quarter of a century it is unnecessary to say anything to those already familiar with it except that it has been rewritten enlarged and brought to date To others it is sufficient to repeat that this is the fourteenth edition of a compre hensive and handsomely illustrated work  The Johns Hopkins University has published a large geologi cal map of the vicinity of Baltimore prepared by Professor G H Williams It is an extension of a similar map prepared by Wil liams and Darton and published by the U S Geological Survey some months ago but the coloring on the present issue departs from the color system adopted for the Survey maps as if experi mentally to try another device better applicable to the region here included The experiment is successful but it does not follow from this isolated instance that the color scheme of the Survey should be changed in its uniform application to the great series of maps for which it was prepared The Geological Survey of Missouri Arthur Winslow director has issued an atlas report on the Higginsville mapsheet with two colored maps and several papes of text chiefly concerning the coal measures of the region The large form of the report avoids the difficulty of folding the maps which constitute its chief feature but the size of the atlas is inconveniently large for easy keeping in the library or on the desk As a forerunner however of what we shall have to deal with when the publica tion of similar atlases of maps and texts is begun by the U S Geological Survey the Higginsville atlas gives us useful practice The extension of such a series of reports to include the other map sheets of Missouri will add greatly to our information about that State  Professor F A Forel of Morges Switzerland has long been known as a careful investigator of the natural history of Lake Geneva on whose borders he was born and bred Several years ago he published a small pocket volume on the various features of the lake and now we receive from Rouge of Lausanne the first of three volumes entitled Le Leman Monographie Limnolo gique Judging the whole work by what now appears as well as by the high standard of Forels previous writings it is not too much to say that it will take an eminent place among scientific monographs ranking with Favres  Alps of Savoy and Heims Mechanism of MountainMaking The division of the present vol ume which will excite most general interest is the serious discussion of the origin of the lake from which Forel concludes that of all suggestions the one which ascribes the basin to the warping of a preexistent valley is by far the most probable The winds of the lake are fully described but in the excursions in connection with them into the theory of cyclones and anticyclones the author evidently ventures into a field somewhat unfamiliar to him his suggestions on this subject not being made in view of all that is known about it The second volume will include an account of the seiches or oscillations of which Forel has already written so much the third will discuss the biology of the lake and its human antiquities An excellent map accompanies the first volume DECEMBER 23 1892

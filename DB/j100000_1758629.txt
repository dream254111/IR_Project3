j100000,Science,1758629,Weekly Summary of the Progress of Science,i300266,224 SCIENCE second report of that commission has just ap peared The most important work upon which the commissioners have been engaged is that of mapping the grounds within the state lim its suitable for the cultivation of oysters and assigning the same to those engaged in that industry upon the payment of an almost nomi nal fee Natural beds or those which have been so within ten years are exempted from assignment The immediate result of this pol icy is to give to the oystermen a property in the ground they use protection against en croachment and security in the possession of improvements thereon This in time will largely increase the yield of this valuable food supply and add to the taxable resources of the state At a time when the beds of the Chesapeake are perilously near a destruction which under the present conditions of folly ignorance and greed in those most interested is inevitable theaction of the state of Con necticut assumes a national importance The work of surveying the coast with the cooper ation of the U S coast survey has been ac tively carried on and in its most important features has been carried out for that part of the shore west from the Connecticut river By the commencement of the workingseason of 1883 it is believed that 90000 acres of oystergrounds will be held by cultivators under state jurisdiction A new mode of cultivation or capture of spat for seed on muddy bottoms has been invented at Groton Birchtrees of fifteen or twenty feet in height and three or four inches in diameter at the butt are thrust about three feet into the mud with the tops under the surface of the lowest water and in clined at an angle of some 45 with the current The floating spat attaches itself to the branch es and grows rapidly a single bush affording in a few months five to fifteen bushels of seed oysters none of which would have survived settling on the muddy bottom An absurd VOL I No 8 claim wa made that these submerged bushes produced scarletfever and diphtheria and many were destroyed but the plan has recently received legal recognition and with proper effort can be made to produce millions of bushels of oysters where is now only waste ground The oysterbusiness in all its branches has attained greater perfection in Connecticut waters than in any other part of the country It is usually very profitable but subject to unexpected and sometimes ruinous losses Thousands of bushels of oysters have been destroyed on one patch in a week by starfish A firm is mentioned which in two years off Charles Island has lost oysters valued at one hundred thousand dollars The starfish seem to move in crowds which scatter when they reach a bed and devour all before them One fisherman while searching for them came upon an immense bunch and gathered in sev entyfive bushels of starfish in a short time thus saving his bed The coot Fulica atra it has been discovered feeds upon young star fish and its protection is recommended The drill Urosalpinx cinereus Stimps and peri winkle Sycotypus canaliculatus Gill as well as the drumfish are reported to do but incon siderable damage especially in the deeper waters The pollution of rivers falling into the Sound the dumping of mud dredged out of harbors and oysterthieving are referred to and legislative regulations suggested The propagation of the oyster has been attempted but thus far with little prospect of success on account of the extreme minuteness and deli cacy of the embryos Without radical im provement on present methods this branch of the subject offers no grounds for belief in its practical application to economic purposes The report contains a map of the triangulation executed and an appendix of statutes bearing on the general topic WIEEKLY SUMMARY OF THE PROGRESS OF SCIENCE ASTRONOMY Comet BrooksSwift The spectrum of this comet was examined at Lord Crawfords observatory Dun Echt Scotland on the evening of March 1 and found to be fairly bright and to consist of the usual three bands  Dun Echt circular No 71 D P T 473 The mass of Jupiter In a paper published in the Proceedings of the Royal Swedish academy 1882 Dr Backlund develops the formulae by which the correction to the mass of Jupiter may be derived from heliometric observations of the distances and positionangles of the satellites inter se and not as usual from the planet He is engaged upon a new determination of this character The chief advan tage in this method is that measures of the starlike satellites from each other are much less likely to be affected by constant errors than are measures of the satellites from the planet The number of unknown quantities in his final equations is twelve six obser vations at least being required in order to obtain all the corrections to the elements  Copernicus Feb D P T 474MARCH 30 1883 SCIE MATHEMATICS Complexes of the second degree Herr Stahl gives a synthetic treatment of certain points in con nection with Kummers sixteennodal quartic surface The processes are new but for the most part the results are well known Journ reine angew math xciii T c 475 Rotation of a liquid ellipsoid  In two articles Mr Greenhill has examined the conditions to be satisfied in order that a liquid ellipsoid may rotate about an axis other than a principal axis and have a free surface The axis of rotation as stated by Riemann lies in a principal plane of the ellipsoid The motion is supposed to be set up in the liquid by mechanical processes and the pressure at any point is investigated the liquid being supposed contained in a rigid shell The conditions are then investigated that are requisite for the ellipsoidal shell to be a sur face of equal pressure and that a free surface can exist  Proc Cambr phil soc 1882 T c 476 NonEuclidean geometryDr Story has shown in a previous paper how the formulae of a non Euclidean plane trigonometry could be deduced from those of the Euclidean spherical trigonometry viz by the replacement of each side by a constant multiple of that side and each angle by a constant multiple of that angle In the present paper he makes the cor responding deduction for any nonEuclidean spherical trigonometry and also gives a number of formulae relating to distances areas etc A new and impor tant principle is exhibited viz the distance or angle between any two geometrical elements points planes or straight lines is to a constant factor pres the same in whatever way it is measured For exam ple the formulae show that the distance of a given point from the nearest point in a given plane is pro portional to the angle between the given plane and the nearest plane through the point ie that which makes the least angle with it the least or greatest distance from a point of one of two given straight lines to a point of the other is proportional to the least or greatest angle which a plane through one of the straight lines makes with a plane through the other and if the lines intersect this is proportional to the angle between the lines etc Expressions are given for the circumference and area of any circle the area of any spherical polygon the surface and volume of any sphere it is also shown that the double plane is identical with a sphere of quasiinfinite radius A further abstract will be given on the completion of the paper Amer journ math v T C 477 PHYSICS Acoustics Vibratory movement of bells  Mathieu has recently studied the vibrations of bells with a pre liminary investigation of the vibrations of bent bars considering the case of an ordinary bell in which the thickness in any meridian increases from summit to base Between the vibratory movement of a bell and that of a plane plate the essential difference exists that while in the latter the longitudinal or tangential movement and the transverse movement are given by independent equations in the former the normal and tangential motions are given by three equations which are not independent The pitch of the notes of a bell does not change if the thickness varies in the same relation throughout every part since the terms depending on the square of the thickness may be neglected at least for the graver partials It is impossible to construct a bell so that it shall vibrate only normally and with a hammer the tangential NCE 225 vibrations are of the same order as the normal vi brations A purely tangential motion can be real ized only with a spherical bell of constant thickness  Journ de phys Jan c R c 47S Vibrations of solid bodies in contact with liquids  F Auerbach has investigated the effect of liquid contained in a glass vessel upon the pitch of the sound produced when the latter is set into vibra tion He reaches the following results 1 The geometrical lowering in pitch ratio of number of vi brations produced by a liquid contained in a cylin drical glass completely filled by it is less in proportion as the pitch of the empty glass is higher 2 The arith metical lowering of pitch with a cylindrical glass of mean pitch is approximately proportional to the recip rocal of the square root of the number of vibrations of the empty glass 3 The lowering of pitch when the glass is completely filled is not noticeably de pendent on its height 4 The geometrical lowering of pitch produced in cylindrical glasses of different widths is greater in proportion as the glass is nar rower 5 The arithmetical lowering of pitch with cylinders of different widths is inversely as the square root of the width 6 The arithmetical change of pitch is inversely proportional to the square root of the number of wavelengths of the sound given by the empty glass contained between the walls and axis of the cylinder 7 The lowering of pitch is greater as the density of the liquid is greater 8 It is greater in proportion as the compressibility of the liquid is less  Ann phys chem 1882 xiii c IS c 479 Optics Photometry Solar photometryM A Crova has recently made some comparisons of the relative brilliancy of the sun and of a Carcel lamp He compared the lightingpower of different wavelengths in the two spectra thereby deducing curves for each The areas enclosed by these curves then represented the total amount of light given out by each source He then deduced the factor by which it was necessary to mul tiply the smaller ordinates in order to render the two areas equal The ordinate of intersection of the two curves of the same area then furnished at once the wavelength whose photometric comparison would give the ratio of the total light emitted by the two sources This wavelength 582 is situated in the yellowishgreen and may be isolated by transmitting the light through a mixture of the solutions of per chloride of iron and chloride of nickel The two lights thus obtained were of precisely the same color and their ratio was at once determined by measure ment with a Foucault photometer After making all corrections this method gives about 60000 carcels 600000 candles  Comptes rendus Dec 18 1882 W H P 480 Electricity Electric amalgamation In the process of ob taining gold by amalgamation from ores containing arsenic and certain other impurities the mercury sickens and fails to take up all the gold present Mr Richard Barker has devised a method of amal gamation which has given very satisfactory results The inclined table over which the ore is washed contains hollows filled with mercury over these in the water containing the washings copper wires are introduced and brought so near that a powerful cur rent may be passed to the mercury which seems to gather itself away from the impurities and to act more energetically upon the ore  Iron Feb 9 J T 481226 SCIE Relation between viscosity and galvanic re sistanc  Mr L Grossman applies formulas de duced by him in a former article Ann phys chem 1882 xvi to the analysis of experiments made by Grotrian Kohlrausch and others on the temperature curves of internal friction and galvanic resistance in fluids obtaining what he considers accurate deter minations of twentyfive temperature coefficients for each of these properties in solutions of six different salts hence he concludes that for these solutions the temperature curves of these two properties are equal  Ann phys chem 1883 i J T 482 Molecular theory of magnetization  D E Hughes in a lecture before the Institution of me chanical engineers says that if a coil be placed at right angles with a plane circuit containing a soft iron wire which passes through the centre of the coil torsion of the wire induces currents in the coil which are reversible with the direction of torsion but independent7of its amount A steel core does not respond in this way to torsion hence by analogy of the effects produced by inclining the core to the plane of the coil the lecturer argues a greater molec ular rigidity in steel than in iron Attention was called to the fact that the coercive power of iron is greater than that of steel if the inducing forces are within the range of iron Iron on being twisted or subjected to longitudinal vibration lost its mag netism steel did not The magnetic properties of iron were illustrated by a glass tube containing iron filings which lost its residual magnetism on being shaken or carefully rotated The greater molecular rigidity of iron alloys was compared to the properties of the tube when petroleum was poured in among the iron filings greater coercive power being thus attained These facts go to support the theory that steel is an alloy of iron and carbon  Iron Feb 2 J T 483 ENGINEERING Stability of brick conduits  Mr A Fteley contrasted the theory on which the designing of brick conduits is based with the actual conditions under which such structures are built Sewers and con duits are often built in ground more or less yielding and the action of the earth about them is an im portant element of their stability Under such con ditions such structures must move more or less after being built and the conditions of stability must be very different from what they appear to be from a study of the original drawing A study of the changes of form by means of exact measurements made during construction might point to defects due to the design or mode of construction to the ground in which the sewer or conduit is built or to the want of care or skill in the builder The author presented a diagram of an apparatus showing in full size on a section drawn at a small scale all the deviations of the brickwork from the true line of section The exaggerated distortion of the outline defines very clearly the slightest defects in construction or the movement of the structure Diagrams were exhibited showing distortions in a conduit nine feet in width and seven feet eight inches high and were taken at points where the conduit was built in firm dry ground in yielding ground in wet trenches on platforms in swampy land and on high artificial embankments From these dia grams and the distortions they exhibited the defects in construction and design in different locations and under different loads were explained The tenden cies of the structure to spread under different con ditions was alluded to also the section of excavation on yielding ground best suited to prevent movement NCE VOL I No 8 An instance of the successful underpinning of a brick conduit was described A large quantity of water broke in between the outside of the brickwork and the sheetpiling supporting the trench and washed away the sand forming the foundation for a length of about thirty feet leaving it without support for that distance A very simple and efficient means was de scribed by which this space was filled with a grout of Portland cement  Bost soc civ eng meeting Feb 21 484 Steel castings  M A Pourcel described recent ly before the Iron and steel institute of Vienna a series of experiments upon steel castings He stated that the chief points to which attention is now di rected are increase in the size of the castings and improvements in the methods of annealing and tem pering in order to endue the casting with the highest mechanical qualities corresponding to the chemical composition The last progressive step was the cast ing of cylinders for a Paris firm 204 m in diameter over 2 m long and 55 mm thick These cylinders supported a pressure of fortyfive atmospheres with out showing signs of percolation  Engineering Dec 8 1882 G A Fi 485 Screwpropeller blades  The use of manga nese bronze as a material for screwpropeller blades is rapidly extending The first run of the Alaska from Queenstown to New York in less than seven days was made immediately after her steel blades had been replaced by blades of manganese bronze The great qualities of manganese bronze are its strength and its freedom from corrosion Recent experiments show that it has a transverse strength about double that of gun metal and also up to the elastic limit double that of steel The cost of manganese bronze is about double that of steel but it is claimed that propellerblades made of the bronze will last during the lifetime of the vessel while steel blades require renewal every three years  Engineering Jan 5 G A E 486 CHEMISTRY General physical and inorganic Formation of carbonic oxideDr L P Kin nicutt suggested a modification of Noacks method Berichte deutsch chem gessellsch xvi 75 for the preparation of carbonic oxide He found that this gas was freely evolved when magnesia alba was heated in a retort with zincdust and that it contained a small percentage of carbonic dioxide  Harvard chem club meeting March 13 487 On the probable existence of new acids containing phosphorus  Concerning the replace ment of oxygen by platinous chloride in certain forms of phosphoric acid Prof W Gibbs made the following suggestions  Schuiitzenberger described some years since a remarkable series of compounds in which platinous chloride Pt C12 replaces a molecule of chlorine or an atom of oxygen Thus we have P C3  Pt C12 chemically equivalent to P C15 The corresponding acid is P  PtCl2  OH3 which may be regarded as a derivative of PO OH 3 The same chemist obtained three other analogous acids having respectively the formulas P2  Pt Cl2  OH6 corresponding to the chloride 2PC3  Pt C12 P2  PtCl2  OH5 and P202 PtCl OH3 In all these cases we have the chemical equivalence Pt Cl2  2 C1  O Hence following up the rela tion suggested by the equivalence expressed by P  Pt Cl2  OH3  P 0  OH3 it seems at least probable that there are modifications of phosphoric acid expressed by the structural formulas  iSCIENCE OH 3 OH OH3 OH3 POP  PPtCl2 P The formula P2  PtCl2  OH5 is structurally un symmetric and must be doubled so that we have P4 2PtCl2  OHio or OH2 OH2 OH 3 P   P  P OH3      0 0 OH2 OH2 OH 3  P  P  P OH3     Pt C12 Pt C12 Finally in the acid P202  PtCl OH3 we have Pt Cl  3 C1 and therefore 2PtCl  30 Hence doubling we have P4 04 03  OH6 and struc turally tf X OH OH OH2  POo P OOPO  OH2  OH OH OH2  PO PO PO PO  OH2   r  Pt Cl Pt Cl It is easy to see that in the last four acids we may expect to find a marked influence of position de pending upon the different modes of union of the hydroxyl  Harvard chem club meeting March 13 488 METALLURGY Action of sunlight upon silver amalgamation By the process as usually conducted native sul phide of silver is converted into chloride by treatment with mixed sulphate of copper and common salt The chloride so formed is decomposed and amalga mated by mercury M P Laur of Rodez has inves tigated this matter in the laboratory In a glass vessel he placed a solution of common salt and sulphate of copper a porous vessel filled with mer cury was suspended in it and a platinum electrode dipped into the mercury the second electrode was a leaf of sulphide of silver and was dipped into the copper solution The electrodes were connected with a galvanometer and the needle was found to swing according to the intensity of the light The cupric chloride was changed by the mercury to cuprous chloride and the latter acted upon the silver sulphide only in the presence of sunlight  Iron Dec 22 1882 B H R 489 Petroleum as a blastfurnace fuel E W Shippen of Meadville recently built a small blast furnace for testing petroleum The furnace was 35 ft high 3 ft hearth 5 ft bosh It was fired with dried wood ironore and limestone Hot oil was injected at the tuyeres under 16 lbs pressure in the form of a spray The whitehot charcoal when struck by the hot oil turned as black as if cold water had been thrown upon it Thle experiment does not appear to have been a success Iron Dec 29 1882 R H R 490 Aluminum A recent patent by Mr Morris of Uddington NB claims to have solved a problem which has long baffled the skill of technical chemists By heating an intimate mixture of alumina and charcoal in a current of carbon dioxide Mr Morris says that metallic aluminum is produced The metal is purified from carbon and alumina by a second fusion  Nature Dec 21 1882 R H B 491 227 GEOLOGY Lithology Crystals of serpentine Professor H C Lewis called attention to some interesting crystals of ser pentine which occur in deweylite from Ways felspar quarry Delaware The crystals have a gray color a pearly lustre and an eminent basal cleavage almost micaceous They polarize light and are optically biaxial with a small axial angle being probably or thorhombic The blowpipe examination and analysis proved the mineral to have the composition of serpen tine The deweylite contains rounded masses of fel spar partially altered into deweylite together with sharp cleavage fragments of quartz such as would be produced by throwing a heated crystal of quartz illto cold water The micaceous serpentine was the result of the alteration of mica but being crystallized was not a true pseudomorph The two points to which he desired to call special attention were the occurrence of serpentine in the crystallized state and the direct alteration of graphic granite into magnesian minerals  Acad nat sc Philad meeting

the work of Ley as expressed by him in the eleven pos MARCH 30 1883228 S CII tulates published in The laws of the winds prevail ing in western Europe he claims that three of these have been shown to be incorrect while the others are confirmed For these three he would substitute the following Mountainous regions in spite of the copiousness of their rains are visited by centres of depression more rarely than the surrounding lowlands and seas in general there is not wholly wanting some influence of precipitation upon the depression but this influence is not yet clearly defined and in any case is but indirect Recent meteorological investigations justify the enunciation of four new theorems which the author gives as follows 1 The direction of aircurrents in our latitudes at the distance of from 500 to 3500 metres from the earths surface is on the average nearly parallel to the isobars of that layer in the lowest stratum it deviates from 0 to 8 points towards the side of the lower pressure and in the layer from 3500 to 9000 metres from the earth from 0 to 2 points towards the side of the higher pressure from the isobars of the respective layer 2 Since the press ure decreases with the altitude more slowly in warm than in cold air the gradients independent of their ratio to the pressure are changed as we ascend in such a manner that an excess of pressure exists upon the side of the warmer aircolumns 3 The advance of the depressions takes place approximately in the direction of that aircurrent within it and approaching its path which has a preponderance of accumulated energy 4 Since the conditions of motion at differ ent heights of the vortex are different there is re quired for its onward movement not the state of motion of the lowest layer but that of the sum total of layers As the changes are continuous with the height the state of motion of a certain mean layer whose height is still to be determined can in general be substituted for it In support of these proposi tions the author refers in detail to the works pub lished in recent years by Terrel Hann Guldberg Mohn and others and thus incorporates the results of the leading meteorologists of the present day  Ann hydr und marit meteor 1882 heft xi w u 499 Pressure of the wind  An apparatus for meas uring the pressure of the wind which promises good results is suggested by Dr Sprung of Hamburg It consists essentially of a hollow metallic sphere erected upon the top of a long rod which is suspended at a point just above the centre of gravity of the appara tus Pressure upon the ball is communicated to the rod and may be recorded by a suitable registering cylinder  Repert exp phys xviii heft 12 w u 500 PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY Australia  The physical structure and geology of Australia is well summarized by Rev J E Tenison Woods The southern side is low or bounded by cliffs three hundred to six hundred feet high the west is a tableland about a thousand feet in height the north is a little higher and the east averages two thousand feet elevation and near the southeastern angle bears the Australian Alps with summits from six thousand to seven thousand feet The interior depression is eccentrically placed near these moun tains and from them the slopes are sufficient to form the only large riversystem of the continent Else where whatever rain falls on the interior plains soon collects in shallow marshes which are generally salt Granite occupies most of the bordertablelands but is sometimes replaced by vertical paleozoic or older slates and schists These remain from a very ancient NCE VOL I No 8 disturbance which had no connection with the present outline of Australia and are at places overlaid by mesozoic strata The great depression contains cre taceous strata overlaid along the southern shore by a full series of marine tertiary deposits reaching three or four hundred miles inland and as much as six hundred feet above sealevel About contemporaneous with their rapid uplift a subsidence occurred forming the castellated fiords and diversified scenery of Port Jack son Broken Bay etc Extensive volcanic overflows are common nearly all around the tableland and gen erally determine the direction of modern drainage Their date is mostly miocene but west of Melbourne they are much more recent and ash cones and craters are frequently preserved There are also scattered isolated masses of crossbedded sandstone forming flattopped mountains bordered by precipitous cliffs so characteristic of Australian scenery These are ranked as tertiary or older eolian deposits and are sometimes a thousand feet thick Other landfor mations are the tertiary drifts  often containing gold from the disintegration of the Cambrian and Silurian rocks and sometimes buried under heavy lavaflows  and the recent sands and clays of the level halfdesert regions derived from the weathered granite covering a great part of the country The sand lies in ridges separated by the yellow clay flats which a little rain makes very boggy The narrow strip of land between the plateau and the sea is generally well enough watered by streams to possess fertile alluvial plains occupying most of its area On higher ground the volcanic rocks for tunately of considerable extension yield the best soils The colony of Victoria has the greatest share of these Farther inland the lands are as a rule poor except in rivervalleys and toward the central basin of the continent they are desert like the Sahara There seems to be good probability that artesian wells may be sunk here successfully This is indicated by the occurrence of springs within the central depressed area Their water is warm indicating a deep source and a supply from the slopes of the surrounding tableland They form travertine deposits in which the remains of gigantic marsupials are found The paleontological evidence of the age of the several for mations above named is given with some detail  Proc Linn soc N S

of Herald Island The data were abstracted from the records of the vessel and demonstrated the prevalence of a current set ting through the Bering Strait to the Arctic The observations were specially directed to this point and Capt Hoopers experience of the previous year and his appreciation of the difficulties attending the question add special value to his deductions on this question The

in living vegetable tissue  Mr Thomas Meehan referred to the prevalent opinion that the liquid in vegetable tissues congeals as ordinary liquids do and expanding often causes trees to burst with an explosive sound Experiments on young and vigorous trees varying from one foot to tlhree feet in diameter demonstrated that in no instance was there the slightest tendency to expan sion while in the case of a large maple Acer dasy carpum three feet eleven inches and a half in cir cumference there appeared to be a contraction of an eighth of an inch In dead wood soaked with water there was an evident expansion and the cleavage with explosion noted in the case of foresttrees in high northern regions may result from the freezing of liquid in the centre or less vital parts of the trunks In some hardy succulentshowever instead of expansion under frost there was a marked con traction The joints or sections of stern in Opuntia Rafinesquei and allied species shrink remarkably with the lowering of the temperature so that the whole surface in winter is very much wrinkled Assuming as a fact that the liquids in plants which are known to endure frost without injury did not congeal it

oxidation es pecially the formation of peroxide of hydrogen Prof Reinke gives the following as a sufficient basis on which to build a theory of oxidation in living cells He has himself shown that there exists in certain plants notably in the beet a very easily oxidizable body which he has named rhodogen This substance is one of Traubes autoxidizable bodies and is only one of many which may be reasonably assumed to be present in cells 1 In every active cell autoxidators are formed that is substances which at a low temperature and by the action of molecular oxygen can be oxidized in the presence of water 2 By oxidation of these substances peroxide of hydrogen is produced 3 This peroxide of hydrogen can under the influ ence of diastase and probably of other ferments cause further oxidations just as atomic oxygen can Lastly the seat of this activity is the periphery of the protoplasmic body of the cell and this body pos sesses an alkaline reaction  Bot zeit Feb 2 and 9 1883 G L

Campanularia and Gonothyraea  Zool anz No 130 w K B 512 Observations on Australian hydroids  Dr Lendenfeld writes that he has independently discov ered in Australian Campanularidae the glandular ring which has been described in Eudendrium by Weiss man and Jickeli He has also verified the existence of Jickelis ganglioncells and he finds similar cells in the endodermal lining of the proboscis where they are very numerous The processes which they give off anastomose with each other so as to build up a definite  nervering around the mouth Lendenfeld regards this as the true central nervous system of hydroids If these starshaped corpuscles of hy droids are really nervecells we have in these animals a central nervous system which is endodermal in its origin and which is not homologous with the nerve ring of the hydromedusae In the Campanularidae the endodermal ganglioncells of the proboscis are joined to sensory cells each of which carries a sensory hair projecting into the digestive cavity

gentleman after reviewing the subject as treated by others concluded that it is prob able that some species of Ammonites perhaps those protected by a deepwater habitat were destitute of these appendages while others perhaps littoral in their range and more subject to attacks from preda cious enemies were provided with them He con siders them as opercular attachments to a hood such as exists in Nautilus Both calcareous and horny Aptychi have been found in situ They are generally smooth or slightly striated but in the Free public museum of Liverpool is a very fine example from the lithographic slate of Solenhofen with a dis tinctly granular surface recalling that of the thick granular hood of Nautilus The appearance of the edges of the valves in this specimen beautifully pre served indicates that its margin was not free as in gastropod opercula but that it was partly imbedded in a cartilaginoLs lobe which fitted the margin of the aperture like the wavy margin of the hood in Nauti lus In this view the hypothesis that Ammonites were internal shells like Spirula would seem to be quite untenable as no internal shell is known which has any opercular apparatus  w H D 514

to beat is rendered capable of further pulsation when dilute alkaline solutions are sent through it Martins con firms this but dissents from Gaules view that the alkali nourishes the heart Its administration leads to a certain number of beats but these soon cease and a fresh supply of alkali is then inefficient while other liquids especially blood serum lead to renewed cardiac contractions Martius concludes that the frogs heartmuscle has in itself no store of energy yielding material which it can call upon but works at the expense of foodmatters yielded it constantly by the liquid circulating through it When the heart irrigated with salt solution ceases to beat this is due to the saturation of its tissue with carbon dioxide while still some nutrient matter blood re mains not washed out from the ventricular network The salt solution acting merely as a medium for physical diffusion cannot remove the carbon dioxide as fast as it accumulates and consequently the heart ceases to beat while it still has some available food The alkali on the other hand chemically removes the injurious carbon dioxide and the heart beats for a short time using the foodstuff in the blood still present in its meshes When the heart treated with dilute alkali ceased to beat new pulsations could only be obtained when it was supplied with liquids containing serum albumen Solutions of syntonin glycogen peptone eggalbumen casein or myosin were useless Gaule 231 had found solution of peptone efficacious This Mar tius thinks must have been due to the fact that Gaule used an alkaline solution of that substance and that the alkali was the efficient element in the liquid  Du Bois arch 1882 543 H N M 518 Influence of different bloodconstituents on the beat of the heart Ringer withdraws his pre vious paper Journ of physiol iii on this subject in consequence of his discovery that the sodium chloride solution with which he worked was not pre pared as he had believed with distilled water It was made with water supplied by the New river company of London and containing salts not only of sodium but of calcium magnesium and potas sium When solution of Na Cl in pure distilled water was used the results previously obtained failed to ap pear On the other hand the rounding of the apex of the curve of ventricular contraction the prolon gation of the curve and the slow diastole previously described as due to sodium chloride are all brought about by solutions of minute quantities of calcium salts in distilled water A very minute quantity of potassium chloride prevents this effect of the lime salts A solution of Na Cl K Cl and Ca C12 in distilled water is perfectly neutral yet makes an ex cellent artificial circulating liquid for the frogs heart This shows that alkalinity of the circulating medium is not necessaiy for contractibility A limnsalt the author concludes is necessary for the manifestation of cardiac contractility but in the absence of po tassium calcium so prolongs the diastole as to lead to fusion of the beats and imperfect action of the heart Sodiumn bicarbonate cannot take the place of the limesalts in maintaining the beat of the heart Journ of physiol iv 291

a depth of 2300 met It has a length of 47 met and a height of 2 cm the body tapering backwards like that of a macrurid The cranial part of the head is short 3 cm long but the suspensorium and jaws are excessively elongated the jaws being 95 cm long The mouth is consequently enormous A long slender style constitutes the upper jaw and is supposed to represent the intermaxillary alone or possibly the intermaxillary and maxillary amalga mated The branchial apertures are represented on each side by  a very small orifice forming a sipple rounded cutaneous perforation situated towards the level of the termination of the buccopharyngeal funnel No fins are described But the stralngest features are revealed by dissection The respiratory apparatus presents it is truly said a constitltion which is at present unique in osseous fishes We find six pairs of interior branchial clefts and conse quently five branchiae each of which is provided with a double series of Jree lamellae No hyoidean apparatus is developed Perhaps the hyoidean appa ratus is represented by the anterior pair of branchial arches It is also asserted that there are no opercu lar pieces Further the suspensoriuni is said to be composed of only two pieces a basal piece the analogue of the temporal and an external piece no doubt representing a tympanojugal No pneuma tocele was found The form thus characterized has been named by Vaillant Eurypharynx pelicanoides and is considered as the type of a new family the Eurypharyngidae Not only indeed does it repre sent a new family its affinities are by no means MARCH 30 1883232 SCIENCE obvious By Vaillant it is thought that the fish presents relations with the Anacanthini with certain Physostomi such as the Scopelidae and Stomiatidae and also with the Apodes It has in fact features of resemblance with the forms noted as well as with the Saccopharyngidae but they are wholly superficial Assuming of course the correctness of the charac ters attributed to Eurypharynx we are compelled to regard it as the representative of a primitive type of fishes and perhaps of a peculiar order related to the dipnoan and ganoid series The examination of the brain heart viscera and skeleton especially the skull and scapular apparatus will doubtless defi nitely determine its relationships  Comptes rendus Dec 11 1882 Ann mag nat hist 5 xi 67 T G 520 Reptiles Development of the caudal region in lizards H Strahl publishes a renewed investigation of the development of the neurenteric canal allantois and tail in lizards His researches were made on Lacerta agilis The early embryonic disk consists of an ante rior field in which the medullary groove is subse quently developed and a posterior field containing the mass of cells forming the primitive streak From the ectoderm of the front part of the streak is formed an invagi nation which deepens and lescends ob liquely forwards For some time the cells lining the invagination do not present a distinctly epithelial character which leads Strahl to consider this lining mesodermic The lower wall of the canal thus formed breaks through establislhing a connection with the entodernmic cavity The axial row of cells in the dorsal wall of the canal becomes elongated making a thickened epithelial band whichi is the anlage of the notochord This anlage gradually ex tends itself farther forward The neurenteric canal marks the hind limit of the medullary canal and of the chorda and moves backward during further growth It is entirely surrounded by mesoderm of the primitive streak After the complete closure of the neural tube the neurenteric canal closes also The primitive streak is directly concerned in the for mation of the tail and of the allantois The latter first appears as a solid mass of cells which afterwards grows out into the pleuroperitoneal space and be comes hollowed The chorda becomes separated from and overgrown by the entoderm in tlhe same manner as has been previously observed in other ver tebrates The caudal gut schivanzdarm lasts rela tively long Its communication with the intestine is aborted but the connection with the neurenteric canal continues longer Strahl argues against Kiipf fers view that the neurenteric canal is directly con cerned in the formation of the allantois He also believes the homology drawn by Balfour between the primitive streak and neurenteric canal on the one hand and the blastopore of fishes and amphibia on the other to be erroneous His arguments on the latter point seem very defective nor does he appear to thoroughly grasp the problem  Arch actat

meeting March 13 522 Mammals Tongue of Perameles origin of tastebulbs The tongue of Perameles nasuta a rare marsupial contains numerous and remarkable sensory organs which have been investigated by Edward B Poulton Towards the base of the tongue are three circumival late papillae the tastebulbs numbering 700 or nmore lying in the papillary wall of the valla In the papillae and around them are numerous serous glands The axis of each papilla is formed by large ganglion which contains only a few but very large cells and gives off nonmedullated fibres to the tastebulbs This is an important observation since in the organs of sight and hearing there always intervene ganglion cells between the sensory apparatus and the central nervous system May it not be also the case with all the gustatory organs The tastebulbs are comnpara tively simple aind appear to contain only one kind of cell The fungiform papillae are chiefly arranged on each side in a single irregular line they very rarely contain tastecells but occasionally a few are found wlich may lie close together but are not united into a distinct tastebulb His observations have led Poul ton to formulate the following theory of the origin of taste bulbs the terminial organs in the mouth would be placed like similar organs in the skin namely in papillary ingrowths of the nmucosa hence the cells would lie together and inl assuming the co lumnar form they would converge towards tlhe outer surface of the skin The convergence of tlle cells would soon lead to their union inlto a bulb One more step differentiation of the central and periplheral co lummar cells of the bulb would produce the gustatory organ of the bigher nmammalia This accotunt of the origin of tastebulbs explains one important dif ference between them and thle other structurally related endorgans as those of the olfactory region or sacculi and ampullae ie in the fact that the gustatory cells are massed together in little groups surrounded by protective cells while the auditory cells in the positions above mentioned and tlhe olfac tory cells are isolated each being separately pro tected by columnar cells This difference it appears is simtply due to the latter elongating from a tolerably plane surface while Ihe gustatory cells have elongated from the curved surface of an interpapillary process    and therefore have met and penetrated the sur face in a group At the siles of the tongue are long filiform papillae with an axial nonmnedullated nerve and over the upper surface are very nuimerous peculiar papillae of small size and surrounded on tlie summit by a ring of fine hairlike papillae generally ten in numbe  but towards the back of tlle tongue the hairs disappear on the anterior side and at last on tlle papillae farthest back there are only two hairs left The top of the main papilla is concave TlIe author describes the interesting histology of these organs but for further details we inmust refer to the

cerebral convolutions of man ex plained by the brainchart Broca was nothing if he was not laborious and painstaking He had hundreds of brains cast He examined them all to ascertain the forms that were typical By means of painted casts and charts he taught his pupils the geography of the brain as one might teach children the map of Europe He introduced a system of nomenclature for the hemispheres

Our early economic history  Professor Meit zen of Berlin reviews von Steins  Drei fragen des grundbesitzes and takes occasion to say a great deal that ist interesting upon the landquestion and the past history of landholding One or two points may be noted here Had we space we should note other points The article is significant in many ways Von Stein makes collective possession and owner ship of land the startingpoint of our economic de velopment but Prof Meitzen says what is certainly true that so far back as the time of Tacitus private property in land existed everywhere This property consisted regularly of hides what the Germans call hufen Attached to these hides were shares or rights in the undivided land the almend The hides were divisible in the early time It was during the feudal period that they came to be indivisible With out doubt the land was common open to every body during the period of migrationsthe nomad period but this condition of things did not last long The land in one place supports only a limited number of animals A large number cannot graze together Separate districts were accordingly assigned to sepa rate herds or several small herds together These herds would belong to different families While some of these families grew rich and powerful others grew poor and weak The latter were driven from their lands or reduced to dependence and servitude Then as there were dependents and slaves to do the work agriculture arose Hides were assigned to the cul tivators which were the property of their respective lords It is probable that the undivided common land was at this time subject to appropriation Every man I   JE VOL I No 8 could have therefore as many hides as he wanted It was at a later time probably that the common land became subject to communal regulations This is Prof Meitzens theory as we understand it It is certainly a great advance on the old theory of primi tive equality and communism Prof Meitzen says  Es ist also allgemeine

wherein each kernel as well as the whole spike is surrounded by a husk It is known under various names such as husk corn Paraguay corn Texas corn wild corn Oregon corn etc The variety planted showed a

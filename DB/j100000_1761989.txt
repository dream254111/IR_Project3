sheet over the mudflat that separated the two lakes And as this outflowing water gradu ally cut down into the old riverbeds as the lakes subsided the top of the clay deposit that covered the ancient peninsula appeared above the surface of the water as the earliest portion of what is now known to us as Grand Island and as the outlet into Lake Ontario lowered the island grew larger with the increasing depth and the narrowing of the chan nels on either side But long before the island had attained any dimensions the waters of the eastern branch of the present river had to force an outlet through the clay deposit between Tonawanda and the head of the rapids and this outlet deepening with the subsidence of the waters cut off the area of Grand Island from the mainland  and the proof of this we find in the sudden decrease of the depth of the river from Tonawanda northward Profes sor Kellicott called attention to a modification of the usual pipette The glass tube passed completely

have been investigating a curious psychical or psychopathological experience which is alluded to by many writers upon psychology and is not infrequently met with in general litera ture It is that vague sentiment of familiarity we sometimes have upon entering a new experience best expressed in the words  I have seen or known all this before It has been explained by various writers upon two widely different theories The first is that this double perception double thinking double presentation as it has been variously named arises from the dual structure of the brain resulting in cases of imperfectly correlated action in two images or impressions not absolutely simultaneous the lat ter therefore is a repetition of the former and gives rise to a sentiment that it has passed through the mind at some indefinite previous time This theory it will be observed is a physiological one The other theory is that the phenomenon is a purely psychical one that the false or illusory memory Erinnerungs tauschung Sander has a real basis in some actual past presentation which is identical or closely simi lar with the present one or in some past images of the waking imagination or dreamlife that although these cannot be recalled into consciousness they are sufficient to give us the conviction that the present event is the repetition of a former one  why or how we do not know There are several cases upon record where this sentiment has assumed a pathological char acter and become a continual delusion attending every experience Two years ago in the hope of obtaining more in formation I distributed a question upon the subject among a large number of persons principally college students It may now be given in somewhat ampli fied form as follows Have you come suddenly upon an entirely new scene and while certain of its novelty felt inwardly that you had seen it before with a conviction that you were revisiting a dimly familiar locality  Mention if you can an instance or two in which this has occurred Has any satisfactory explanation of this experience ever suggested itself to you How frequent is the experience in your case W4Zas it more friequent in childhood than at present  How soon do you usually become conscious of the deception  Does it occur more frequently in connection with some kinds of experience than with others  A quantity of material upon this subject has already been collected in this and other ways which I hope to publish in a review article in April In the mean while any information bearing upon this question will be of great assistance and value to me HENRY F OSBORN Princeton NY Feb 23 Ripplemarks in limestone The alternating limestones shales and sandstones of the upper coalmeasures of Kansas are well ex NCE VOL III No 57 posed along the ridges and watercourses near Eureka Some of the limestone is thinbedded apparently due to interlaminated sheets of argillaceous material The layers of limestone however seem to contain little foreign matter certainly not more than the Trenton limestones Buff of Wisconsin and Minne sota The organic remains consist largely of crinoid columns shells of brachiopods and lamellibranchs and a few gastropod shells and cup corals Nearly every layer of limestone shows these remains in great abundance firmly bound together by the highly crys talline matrix I have been thus particular in describing the lime stone that the conditions which made the following feature possible may be understood Some six or eight slabs of this limestone in one of our sidewalks are clearly and distinctly ripplemarked This is the first instance of the kind that has fallen under my observation during ten years of state and private work in nearly as many states of the Union The occurrence of ripplemarks in calcareous mud containing the remains of deepsea clearwater ani mals and interlaminated with argillaceous mud is a combination not quite in accordance with the teach ings of our textbooks in geology L C WOOSTER Eureka Kan Feb 23 A novel magnetic engine It is a wellknown fact that iron when heated to a red heat ceases to be magnetic so that an armature after being heated to redness may be removed from its magnet by the expenditure of only a small fraction of the energy which is developed by the attraction of the same armature when it has cooled Manifestly this fact might be employed in the con struction of a motor which while of no practical value is of theoretical interest in which a perma nent magnet should act as the direct motive force This has been done in the following manner In the figure a b c represents a ring thirteen centimetres in diameter and supported hori zontally upon radial arms and an axis of some nonmagnetic metal This ring is made of one or more ill  a jIN sj 1 turns of iron wire of about a mil limetre diameter NS is either a permanent or an electro mag net The axis is furnished with a drivingpulley cord and weight  as shown in the figure That part of the ring which lies between a and c is heated to bright redness by means of two or three Bunsen burners The magnet then exerts a prepon derating attraction upon the farther or cool side of the ring and the latter revolves as indicated by the 1 I

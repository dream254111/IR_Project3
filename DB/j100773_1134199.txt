combined annual expense of which was approximately 250000 A monetary saving of 850000 per year is tlhus shown for the system besides certain other expenses which are saved but which do not appear such as transportation for prisoners and guards between stations unusual medical treatment etc The marine guard at prisons has been reduced from 23 officers and 849 men in 1913 to 7 officers and 326 men in 1916 If the abovementioned reductions in prisons and expenses had been affected at a sacrifice to the discipline of the service I would most certainly feel that they were not of value However in view of the almost unanimous verdict of the service as well as the data in regard to desertions discharges etc as set forth above that the system of probation under suspended sentence has resulted in improving discipline I point with pride to the above enumerated results accomplished by this reformFrom the Report of the Judge Advocate General of the Navy Year 1916 MISCELLANEOUS Organization of the Public Welfare Department in IllinoisAn almost revolutionary change has been made this year in the administrative machinery of Illinois The readers of tlis Journal are interested in what has taken place in the charitable and penal institutions Eight years ago the General Assembly abolished the local boards of trustees and created a central board to have administrative authority over all the institutions in what was known as the charitable group The State Charities Commission was created at the same time to exercise supervisory and advisory functions in the institutions managed by the Board of Administration This form of administration has been in operation with great benefit to the institutions and to the public ever since The penal institutions three in number remained under the control and management of separate boards of trustees Centralization was one of the keynotes of the last political campaign in Illinois Both parties were pledged to a reorganization of the departments after the lines laid down by the Efficiency and Economy Committee which had devoted four years to an intensive study of the departments of state gov ernment One of the first duties undertaken by Governor Lowden after his election was the drafting of a comprehensive bill to meet the pledges which he had made during the campaign This bill was accepted by the Legislature almost without a dissenting vote It was found advisable to confine the reorganization and consolidation scheme to those departments which were under the jurisdiction of the governor There were some 120 boards and commissions carrying on this work all subject to the control of the governor No effort was made to change or amend the laws which these boards and commissions were charged with carrying out but the idea was to simplify the form of administration These various func tions were therefore grouped into nine departments each with a director in charge These nine directors form a cabinet to the governor How this scheme was worked out in detail is not of concern here except as to the Department of Public Welfare Into this department have been grouped all that were included under the Board of Administration the State Charities Commission the trustees of the 468 PUBLIC WELFARE DEPARTMENTPUBLIC WELFARE DEPARTMENT 469 three penal institutions and the Board of Pardons and Parole All these have been abolished and in their place has been set up a department consisting of the following appointive officials Director of Public Welfare Assistant Director of Public Welfare Superintendent of Charities Superintendent of Prisons Superintendent of Pardons and Paroles Fiscal Supervisor Criminologist Alienist The director is supreme in all matters coming under the jurisdiction of these subordinates He reports direct to the governor There can be no division of authority or responsibility The subordinate officials report to the director He approves or disapproves The Superintendent of Charities will have general management of the 21 institutions in the charitable group the Bureau of Visitation of Children and the Bureau of Instruction of Adult Blind The Superintendent of Prisons will exercise similar jurisdiction over the three penal institutions but in addition will sit as an advisor with the Superin tendent of Pardons and Paroles in carrying out the parole law and in hearing petitions for pardons The Superintendent of Pardons and Paroles will carry out the parole and pardon laws which have not been changed except that this one official takes the place of the three members of the Board of Pardons The Fiscal Supervisor as his title indicates will have charge of the book keeping statistical and accounting systems of all the institutions The Criminologist and the Alienist will be advisory officers the first to the Superintendent of Prisons and the Superintendent of Pardons and Paroles the second to the Superintendent of Charities and through him to the director The law does not fix the qualifications or the duties of any of the officials it creates The director fixes them What qualifications the Criminologist and Alienist shall have were also left to the department to determine and it has been found advisable in view of all the work which it is desirable to do that both of these men shall have the same general qualifications education and experience with this exception that the Criminologist shall have specialized along the lines of crime while the Alienist shall have devoted himself to the insane and feebleminded Consequently the Alienist and Criminologist are doctors of medicine gradu ates of recognized schools specially trained in pcychiatry They are also psychologists and have had experience in institutions for mental diseases both as administrators and as scientific men Dr Edward Singer superin tendent of the State Hospital at Kankakee has been appointed State Alienist and Dr Herman Adler of the Cook County Juvenile Court State Criminologist Governor Lowden informed all the directors that he would appoint none of their subordinates without their full sanction On the contrary he asked the directors to recommend to him the men who would be satisfactory to them in these positions This has been particularly true in the Department of Public Welfare PUBLIC WELFARE DEPARTMENT 469470 PUBLIC WELFARE DEPARTMENT For Director Mr Charles H Thorne of Chicago was chosen by the governor Mr Thorne had been head of Montgomery Ward  Company but had retired from its active affairs For Superintendent of Charities Mr A L Bowen was selected Mr Bowen had been for seven years executive secretary of the State Charities Commission For Fiscal Supervisor Mr Frank D Whipp was named Mr Whipp has been the Fiscal Supervisor of the Board of Administration since its creation and prior to that time was in the fiscal department of the Board of Charities for many years The State Charities Commission is abolished in name only It is now known as the Board of Public Welfare Commissioners and will carry on the same work of supervision and inspection The Department of Public Welfare will not do the buying or the building for the various institutions under its charge The Department of Public Works will build all buildings and purchase all supplies but the Department of Public Welfare will have the right to make the specifications and requisitions and to pass on the supplies and the work before payment is made Many overlapping activities disappear in the new organization It will save thousands of dollars in salaries and wages traveling expenses office supplies and the like and without doubt will perform the work in a more efficient manner This is the first experiment on so large a scale of the oneman power in the administration of public institutions from which politics have been eliminated and into which it has been sought to place men on the sole basis of merit and experience The above account is practically identical with the statement in the Institution Quarterly Vol VIII No 2 470 PUBLIC WELFARE DEPARTMENT

j100000,Science,1633193,Relations of Salary to Title in American Universities,i295956,RELATIONS OF SALARY TO TITLE IN AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES IN this paper is considered the problem of the relation existing between salary and title under the conditions ruling in Amer ican colleges and universities What ad justment of these relations is most favor able to the effectiveness of the institution concerned In general three types of ad justment are possible In the one case a fixed salary may be attached to the profess orship and to eaeh of the lower grades of rank Next each grade may have a fixed minimum salary with a system of auto matic increase with length of service and for no other cause The third relation is the one generally prevalent the salaries in any grade are not definitely fixed and increase of salary may be made at any time and for many reasons other than those connected with length of tenure The first of these systems aims so far as professors are concerned to establish a republic of letters It would develop a condition in which a man once chosen for a chair is responsible to no one but him self and in which he neither expects pro motion nor fears its failure because his character and work are judged by no presi dent no committee and no executive board The men in minor positions are professors in waiting to receive recognition in case of vacancy or of departmental expansion 1A paper read at the Cambridge meeting of the Association of American Universities November 23 1906 The paper was prepared by John Max son Stillman professor of chemistry in Stanford University242 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 These again are held on an equality pend ing the opportunity to rise to greater re sponsibilities and greater remuneration The second system is a modification of the first with the added recognition of the fact that with university men the expenses of living increase with the years The third system considers the problem from the standpoint of the efficiency of the univer sity organism and of the actual value of the professor to his students In it the element of competition appears and the greater pecuniary reward goes with the greater academic service The first and second systems imply a static organism a university with its form and scope fixed once for all and the professors as incum bents of established positions The third system is dynamic It implies the growth of the university organism and the value of personality as a factor in different phases of growth Taking universities as they are the in stitution is not a republic of letters on the one hand as there are students as well as professors to be considered On the other hand it does not find its homo logue in a great business enterprise It is not alone what the members of the faculty do but the ideals they represent which is important In the practical discussion of the first and second of these systems we may as sume that if promotion is impossible or automatic within the grade the promotion from one title to another is not likewise automatic In such cases there would be no possibility of any discrimination be tween men of different value except by the difficult method of dismissal of such as fail to reach the plane of efficiency de sired in the highest positions One of the most obvious arguments in favor of like remuneration for equal grades is that it relieves the university av thorities from the difficulty of attempting to assign different money values to serv ices extremely difficult even impossible equitably to appraise No university president and no board of trustees nor indeed any other body of men can have the intimate knowledge of the values of the services of men in a university faculty adequate for the establishment of just dis criminations in salary on the basis of serv ice rendered Even if we assume such intimate knowledge we are at once con fronted with even greater difficulties of establishing the standards of judgment as to the value of these services The ele ments entering into the value of a univer sity teacher are manye g originality scholarly productivity teaching capacity industry energy personal influence char acter executive capacity Different men place the emphasis very differently on the relative value of these different qualities and agreement as to their relative im portance is impossible Such being the case discriminations in salary between men of approximately equal standing can not be equitably administered When therefore it is attempted to establish such discrimination there results dissatisfaction in the faculty Faculty members criticize the discrimination in the light of their own knowledge of the men and their work and according to the em phasis they place upon their various quali fications This engenders jealousies and gives rise to attempts to influence the presi dent to recognize the claims of individuals and cliques and factions are created Stim ulated by the uncertainties as well as by the possibilities of the shifting basis of salaries political methods personal in fluence and wirepulling become preva lent Discontent lack of harmony among the faculty members and between faculty and president are the natural conse quences The president is charged with favoritism and professors are accused ofIEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 243 exerting undue influence on behalf of their own interests or of the interests of their friends or favored subordinates I have endeavored to present this argument strongly and we must admit that there is justice in the objections to the attempt to estimate closely the values of men by dif ference in salary On the other hand if we admit that harmony would be promoted to a certain extent by the same pay to men of the same title we must consider at what cost this harmony must be secured The above argument depends for its validity upon the assumption that the pay is an important element in the ambition and desires of the university teacher It would be strange if it were not Uni formity in pay if it is to be a satisfactory condition assumes at least approximate equality of value to the university It is very evident that no such condition exists in any university faculty In any faculty there are wide differences in the value of different men to the university whatever criteria of value may be assumed It is neither fair nor just to expect men of ex ceptionalvalue to be satisfied withsalaries paid to men of distinctly inferior academic value There is injustice in not recognizing increasing influence scholarship and gen eral usefulness by commensurate increase in salary Nor should it be necessary to pay men of mediocre value the higher remuneration which is fairly deserved only by the strongest men If it be argued that none but men of approximately the same ability and value should hold the same rank it can be as serted that such a condition is practically unrealizable as may be easily verified by considering any given faculty It is a matter of greater difficulty for a president and trustees infallibly to select the strong est men only for professors than it is to properly appraise their services when in the university service Appointees do not and can not equally fulfill the hopes and expectations under which they were appointed but once appointed they can not be summarily dismissed to make place for greater men so long as with a fair degree of scholarship industry and devo tion they pursue their career but there is no justice in paying such men the same as ought to be paid to those who are of distinctly higher value to the university and to scholarship Furthermore when a man by reason of merit attains a full pro fessorship early in life if Ihe feels that thereafter with moderate attention to duty his salary is assured without hope of in crease on the basis of value rendered an important incentive is lost to him for his future progress and development He is deprived of a stimulus to activity and ambition not without its influence uponn common human nature even in academic circles There is also the moreutilitarian idealo supply and demand which must be taken into account No university has unlimited means at its disposal and the problem of administration is to perform the most effect ive s service or education andthepincrease of knowledge with the means at its dis posal To fulfill its responsibilities to its students and the public it must secure and hold the most efficient men possible If the law of supply and demand sets un usualy high the value of the good men in certain lines or the value of exceptional men in any line it then becomes the duty of the university to pay some men salaries which it can not afford to pay to all It may be claimed on the other hand that universityteachers do not and ought not to enter the career for the commercial value of the position The world offers other opportunities for those who seek large incomes and the university teacher who is fitted for the work looks to enlarged oppor244 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 tunities for study research and to the love for his work as a teacher for the rewards of his success rather than to financial re wards This is unquestionably true to some extent Nevertheless within the limits of salaries at present existing in the universities the fact remains that univer sity teachers are appreciative of and de sirous of such increases in their remunera tion as lie within the range of present possibilities in any university Until the range of university salaries is distinctly higher than at present university teachers will find that the minimum salaries paid in any institution are not so large but that they are compelled to deny themselves and their families many reasonable comforts and luxuries which are greatly desired by all people of similar culture and social status And so long as this is true the university must face the necessity of com peting with the world outside for the serv ices of thoroughly competent and ambi tious men in many lines For the less wealthy universities particularly the com petition for the best teachers would under a fixed salary scheme render it impossible for them to hold their strongest men if to do so they were compelled to pay an equal salary to all holding the same title In consideration of all these factors in the problem is it not probable that the gain of simplicity of administration and some measure of harmony in the faculty by the system of equal pay to equal rank would be made at too great an expense of efficiency  We must not overlook the fact that if equal pay to equal rank were the rule dis criminations would still have to be made in the matter of promotions from one grade to the next In promotions not only the pecuniary consideration is concerned but a public honor is conferred Precisely the same variety of considerations enters into the qualifications for promotion as into salary differences The same lack of agree ment as to what relative weight should be given to teaching power productivity as a scholar personal influence and character etc exists here and the same possibilities of jealousies suspicions of favoritism wirepulling and personal influence The writer is inclined not to lay great emphasis on the dangers of such influences as neces sarily incident to either system under dis cussion Wherever discriminations have to be made into which enter estimates of the relative values of such services whether by differences in pay within the same grade or by promotion there is bound to be some dissatisfaction and discontent A just and wise administration will reduce these evils to a minimum by inspiring the faculty generally with confidence in the fairness and general good judgment with which such discriminations are made Entirely eliminated dissatisfaction and discontent can never be At best they can be con fined to those members who differ with the constituted authorities as to the relative value of their services and perhaps to their particular friends Under either sys tem these administrative difficulties will exist and remain the same in character though differing possibly somewhat in de gree These difficulties will be lessened to a great extent by avoiding the making of small differences in pay between men of the same rank For while the reasons may be readily apparent to the university com munity why a considerably larger salary must be paid to certain individuals it will be much more difficult to justify small dif ferences in salary to men of the same rank For small differences in general usefulness or value to the university it will be admit fed are not possible of fair estimation They are not justified either on theoretical or on economic grounds They tend toward discontent and irritation without materialFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 245 saving to the university treasury and they can not command the general approval of the university public When certain men stand out so prominently as to deserve to be recognized by the authorities by a larger reward than their associates the university community generally recognizes the fact but the reasons for such recognition should be such as to be clearly recognized Where however such is not the case then equal pay to equal rank is the safer and fairer basis The practical working out of the salary problem to my mind should be on some such lines as the following Each grade or title should have a mini mum salary pertaining to it This salary should be large enough to insure comfort able living with due regard for the reason able demands of cultured taste Much discontent arises because the minimum sal ary of the various grades is often so low that men can not live as the requirements of their profession and social status de mand This inadequate minimum compels the authorities to make advances of salary to meet personal necessities which are not always justifiable on the grounds of rela tively greater service rendered Appoint ments to the lower ranks should be proba tionary and the university should be con sidered perfectly free to terminate such positions to continue them or to promote to a higher grade in due time Within each grade certain allowances of increase in pay should be made for length of satisfactory service Above these minimum salaries there should be the power to advance the salary of any man when it is clearly for the interest of the efficiency of university work to do so Generally speaking the maximum salary of one grade should be less than the minimum of the grade above though even here it is imaginable that a departure occasionally from this rule might become a justifiable exception In each grade the authorities should have the op tion of leaving a particular teacher undis turbed at the minimum of his grade and time of service or of advancing him in recognition of extraordinary ability or un usually valuable service They must also have the option of promoting or of passing by any individual according to his deserts or the universitys needs In the lower grades below that of professor while the deserving character of a member must be considered it must also be kept in mind that the scope of the university work and the financial limits of the university may prohibit promotions even when fairly de served Even very good men must often look abroad for their promotions In the higher grades it is assumed that perma nency of position is reasonably assured and this should guarantee the minimum salary of the grade and time of service without any presumption of further in crease unless fairly won by unusual dis tinction and recognition but the univer sity should then be free to recognize such service freely both for the encouragement of scholarly ambition and to be able to re tain its strongest men Briefly summarized we may say that the maximum efficiency of the university work and a minimum of administrative difficulty resulting from inequalities in pay in the same grade will be attained by a minimum or normal Walary for each grade large enough so that men of reasonable desires may live and do their work and maintain their families without worry and discom fort by reasonable increases dependent upon length of efficient service and with freedom to recognize unusual ability or distinguished service as the requirements of the case may demand Such recogni tion however should be made for reasons the reasonableness of which should appeal to the university faculty generally Upon the assignment of this topic to Stanford University President Jordan is246 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 sued a circular letter to many presidents and faculty members asking their opinions upon the question involved At the time of writing some hundred answers have been received The limits of time prevent the writer from obtaining permission to quote over their signatures the many interesting answers I append however quotations from some of them that are typical of cer tain classes of answers and which will sup plement the above brief discussion Of sixteen college or university presidents fourteen are opposed to equal pay for equal rank one in favor and one answer not de cisive Of eightyone faculty members sixty are opposed seventeen in favor four gave no decisive answer Some thirty three emphasize the value of an established minimum for each grade increases above which may be made for good reasons as length of efficient service unusual ability or general usefulness JOHN MAXSON STILLMAN STANFORD UNIVERSITY The following quotations are from presi dents of universities I am firmly of the belief that there should be no rigid salaries payable to all men in the uni versity bearing the same title In other words I believe that the university should pay what it thinks a man is worth If a certain department is in need of a very eminent man it would be wise for it to pay him double the salary ordi narily given I believe that the principle should be variation according to ability and experience and quality of usefulness to the institution at any given time 2 In my judgment while the salaries of profess ors in any institution will naturally gravitate toward some given figure I see no reason why there should not be deviations therefrom due to the greater value to the university of some men over others or the need of larger compensation to retain such men in the service of the uni versity In the case of assistant professors and instructors who are appointed for a fixed period of time I see little if any objection to uni formity of salary 3 Sitting in an easy chair one can argue ones way with perfect satisfaction to ones self up to the conclusion that all men having the same title should have the same salary but I have never been able to manage a university on that prin ciple and I have never been able to acquire such ability Extraordinary things are always com ing in to interrupt in the application of the theory We have here assistants instructors assistant professors professors head professors deans president Some of the instructors get as large salaries as some of the assistant professors some of the assistant professors get as large salaries as some full professors Where action is in our hands we prefer within reasonable limits to increase salaries rather than titles Sometimes however a man insists upon an in crease of his title and to refuse him means to lose him whenever a good offer comes from another institution Sometimes it is possible to increase a title and to promise the increase of salary on and after a certain date when addi tional money is expected Some men insist upon increase of salary more than upon increase of title and vice versa Sometimes you must in crease the salary and title both I need not point out that the case does not occur in which an assistant gets as much salary as an assistant professor nor a case in which an instructor gets as much salary as a full pro fessor but instructors and assistant professors do run together sometimes in respect to salaries and so also assistant professors and professors in some instances 4 I beg leave to say No The reason of the answer seems to me to be summed up compre hensively in the remark that men even college professors differ in character and efficiency Therefore the pecuniary recognition may fittingly vary according to their work and worth The individual and not the institutional method should prevail It is much easier to administer a college on the basis of the same compensation for men of the same professorial grade but I believe that such administration is not wise either for the individual or for the institution itself in large relations or fitted to promote the higher interests of the whole community 5 I know of no solution of this problem which seems to me entirely satisfactoryFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 247 There are those who think that a fixed system or scale of some sort should be adopted and followed That would be the easiest plan for the trustees and the president Perhaps it is the right plan But after the most careful considera tion it does not seem so to me I do not find any institution such as ours where any fixed system has been found practicable though various systems have been given trial A fixed system of promotions and salaries is said to work well in the armyin time of peace In time of war it is in the army as in all other callingsthe system must go to make way for the most efficient service Aside from the differences between men which count in every occupation and must count among teachers as well as others there are circum stances and conditions which vary from depart ment to department and render a fixed system a heavy handicap upon the maximum efficiency of the university The university can not for example make nothing of the fact that it is very much more difficult to get good men in certain departments than in others This fact constitutes part of the reason for one exceptional recommendation made at this time In such cases the university can not afford to restrict itself artificially by a system On the other hand the conditions and circum stances in another department may make it ex tremely difficult to promote every worthy man The commonest example in the universities gen erally is that of the department whose places are already filled by a practically permanent staff of good men If one looks at the case of a single individual relief seems easy But some one must look at all the individuals Some one must look at the budget for the year Some one must con sider what the budget will be next year and in the following years when outgoes are growing and incomes are standing still In a word some one must consider the life of the university as a whole When one does that the problem of advancing all the individuals who deserve it ap pears not simply difficult but impossible No university is rich enough to make places and salaries for all who deserve them No university has a right to make place or salary for any man unless this is justified by the interests of the institution In fine an automatic system is easy and peace ful It relieves the trustees and the president from their most trying responsibility But in my judgment it must again and again pay for this peace and pleasant irresponsibility by the sacrifice of essential university interests I believe that the trustees and the president must choose a harder and more troubled course They must accept the responsibility of doing what they believe to be best and must abide the consequences to themselves and to the university  I do not forget as I write the firstrate im portance of a good spirit within the faculty The maintenance of that spirit requires that the administration of affairs should be reasonable and disinterested But if a reasonable and disin terested administration which must often bring disappointments to individuals and which must sometimes make mistakes does not develop a good spirit within the faculty the whole problem seems to be hopeless 6 While there are diplomatic reasons for giving the same salary to men holding the same title in a college there is no justice in it as it is im possible to secure men of equal effectiveness in their respective positions The question of ad ministration is doubtless easier if professors are placed on equal salary but there seems no suf ficient reason to my mind why the laws of supply and demand should not be applied to college pro fessors as well as in other walks of life 7 There is no reason why the same salary should be paid to men bearing the same academic title in other than the subordinate grades such as assistant tutor and instructor I think that assistant or adjunct professors and more par ticularly professors should be compensated as individuals and not as members of a group the amount of compensation to vary in accordance with particular circumstances affecting the na ture the quality and the amount of their aca demic service The following quotations are from fac ulty members 8 For a categorical answer to the question I should say no The dilemma which the question involves is in some respects similar to that which appears in the question of salaries for public school teachers and is somewhat more remotely analogous to that which appears in the whole problem of ap pointment promotion and salaries in the civil service On the one hand a mechanical uni formity is easy of administration and shuts out248 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 the dangers of favoritism wire pulling and the whole set of evils that are commonly described as political On the other hand such a system makes it impossible to adjust the external re wards of service to differences of experience capacity and lifeneeds among those to whom the schedule of salaries applies It may be taken for granted that there will be an upper limit of salary which will be low enough to prevent the position of instructor from becoming an object of covetous competition and there will be also a lower limit which is not too low to enable a selfrespecting man to live respectably I can well understand that even within these limits there is danger to the scientific and spiritual in terests of a university in a sliding scale which may seem to emphasize purely what may be called the market value of a man but it should be remembered on the other side that a thousand differences of personal and family need of general makeup and disposition not seriously affecting a mans scholastic efficiency and other differences too numerous to mention are present and must be considered and ought to be considered when a man in a given institution is offered a higher salary in another institution or in some other occupation for which his talents may fit him Without entering into any unseemly competition on purely financial grounds an institution may consider and I think ought to consider such differences in adjusting the salaries of instruct ors within such limits as are suggested above There is not much danger that an instructor will work for money chiefly or will get rich even if he does but even in a university a man who renders services of extraordinary value should have a fair opportunity of receiving a larger in come than another instructor of the same scho lastic grade whose services are notably inferior to his The difference in salary will not pay for the difference in service and can not be made to pay for it but it may render the more useful man a little more free to make the most of his useful life by travel by acquisition of the means of culture and research and by the various other ways which are within the purchasing power of money and it may render him better able to help his family and friends and those who have a right to look to him for help 9 1 I do not think that the same salary should be paid to men bearing the same title But this under the following provisos 2 There should be a minimum salary for each rank no less than which each appointee should receive upon his advancement to the rank 3 There should also be a maximum salary for each rank attainable by those members of the rank whose abilities and performance show that they deserve it 4 Promotions within each rank should be upon proved merit judged in the light of the quality of departmental work and without reference to university politics or work in the manipula tion of committeesin short the study or the courting of influence whether with authorities or with students The rate or rapidity of pro motion should correspond to the proved value of research and teaching service 5 Advances in salary as in rank should be made in sole conformity with the advice of the president and this advice should result from con sultation with the departmenthead under whom the candidate serves and should unless there is clear adverse reason follow the heads advice 10 My feeling is decidedly in favor of equal salaries as tending to greater unanimity of feel ing among professors and so to greater loyalty to the university Equal salaries seem to elimi nate so far as possible the whole element of favorthe personal equationand this sets every one free to do his best according to his light for the university Equality too removes the possi bility of bargaining of jewing up or jewing down a salary according to the exigencies of the moment This policy too seems to me to be in the long run the more dignified for the university A man comes to it not because he is bought at a high price but because the university as a whole suits him He takes his place in the equal brotherhood of professors feeling that his for tunes are bound up with theirs and so with the fortunes of the whole university    Of course equality of salaries will occasionally prevent a university from securing an able man who might have been secured by subsidizing himand it will result in some men being paid more and some less than the market will bear    Of course this preference for equality does not preclude an advance for years of service so long as the advance as at Harvard is automatic so to speak and not a thing to be bargained for or begged for I have heard of one interior university where advance of salary must even be toadied for    And yet in the long run I am convinced thatFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 249 equality of salaries tends to contentment to fra ternity of feeling to loyalty and to the mini mizing of the force of the mercantile spirit in a faculty    My argument is intended to apply chiefly to full professors the peers of the realm There is no objection to a money stimulus to the men who are still on probation with their spurs to win 11I 1 It is necessary in my opinion to separate the college of arts and sciences from the tech nical colleges in the discussion 2 If there were sufficient men who were called to teach in the sense that the old apostles were called for their work then I believe that there would be no question of diversity of salary All that would be needed would be barely enough to keep soul and body together 3 While there are plenty who would like the call of a university there are not enough with the call to fill college positions This puts the colleges in the field of competition with the practical world for the allround capable and forceful men who are not satisfied on the one hand with the dead level of communism or on the other with things as they are and have been Progress and experiment to attain that progress is their motto Now to get these men to put their courage and force to the service of a col lege the college must offer them something like the chance they would have in the great world that is a chance to receive the reward to which their force and courage entitle them 4 To obtain the men with the force and courage which shall make the university a real and living part of the civilization of the time the university mustin a measure at leastappre ciate the reward which is offered by the world for the kind of service it desires There is no doubt that money at the present time is taken as the measuring stick of men Money certainly makes it possible for men to attain much which is most desired by them and their families After men have once caught the divine fire which comes to the college teacher money ques tions would not so much affect them what I am contending for is that the university get the forceful characters into its faculty by offering rewards which will attract them It can not afford to be manned by those who can not get a living so easily any other way 5 Technical SchoolsThe same general state ments may be made as with reference to the college of arts but here the university comes into more direct competition with the practical world If the technical school is to be an integral part in directing the progress of the civilization of our time the men who form its faculties must be among the chosenmen with strong character clear heads and the courage and foresight to make the necessary advances Then the schools could hope to be leaders instead of mere trailers Now to get a sprinkling at least of the real leaders there must be provision in both salary and rank And the salary in the technical school must average considerably higher than in the col lege of arts 6 Just the method to pursue to attract into the teaching profession the allround forceful men so much needed in colleges may perhaps be answered by creating special positions with cor responding salarysuch as head professor dean director etc This might leave the rank and file in a group with uniform salary and therefore without one element of discord 7 In closing then I would say that in the modern university there must be diversity of salary and rank in each college and a distinction between the college of arts and the technical schools While it may not be germane I would like to put in a plea for appreciation of the teacher who is really called He after all is as much needed as the one who can do magnificently anything he puts his brain and hand to Money is usually much less prized by him than opportunity for study for investigation in his chosen field 12 Apparently it is not practicable to pay the same salary to all men holding the same rank in a faculty and yet a wide departure from this policy seems to work great injustice in many cases I once believed that a university president should be free to pay whatever salaries he found necessary to secure the men he wanted and that salaries within the faculty should be based en tirely upon efficiency I have now come to regard the other extreme with an absolutely fixed scale as preferable to this method No man is omniscient nor can any man know with a higher degree of approximation the rela tive efficiencies of the men in a moderately large faculty Even the men in the same department or in closely related departments differ widely in their estimates of any particular man One lays the stress on one qualification and one on another Hence while no individual is compe tent to pass upon the salary scale of a whole250 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 faculty no group of men will come to any agree ment upon such a scale Most men are so constituted that their opinion of the qualifications of others depends largely upon their personal likes and dislikes I know that I am personally very strongly influenced by such considerations others are so constituted that they yield to persistent pressure on the part of one who is working for an increase of salary and still others may be influenced by the cliques which are always formed in a faculty for the purpose of boosting their members ITence when ever a man receives a higher salary than others whom the general consensus of opinion would rank in the same class there are apt to be charges of favoritism or pull In this way the influence of the president who has the fixing of salaries is bound to be greatly weakened    Again assuming that a man of absolutely im partial mind and of wide information could be given the authority to fix salaries there is no general agreement as to the grounds upon which distinctions should be based One man is an ex cellent teacher and exerts a great influence upon the lives of his students another is a great in vestigator and does not know the names of his students Which should receive the greater salary Most men are neither great teachers nor great investigators but one excels in some par ticular and another in something else How shall we say which is entitled to the greater salary I am aware that absolute uniformity is im possible even if it were desirable Certain de partments are compelled to pay more for men of equal ability and preparation than other depart ments At any one time there are living in the world only a few firstclass men in any pro fession and a university which is able to afford the luxury of such a man should be compelled to pay for it However the total number of such men in the world is not large enough to make it necessary to take them into consideration in deciding upon the general policy of a univer sity So I believe that university salaries should as far as possible be fixed upon an arbitrary basis taking into consideration the rank and time of service of the men and that departures from this fixed scale should be made only for weighty reasons reasons which would be recog nized by the faculty as a whole 13 I may now say very briefly that I think uni versity teachers of the same title should not re ceive the same remuneration With such a plan I believe we would have too serious an inter ference with the great law of supply and de mand In our academic guild there are already too many impediments to the free working of the law of the struggle for existence and the sur vival of the fittest The principle of the re demption of the unfit which our too pious altruistic brethren are introducing as a counter law to the law of evolution is being overworked in these times Everywhere in life a man should be paid what he is worth I know that many of my colleagues say that this would introduce commercialism into university life It is often said that university men can not do their best work if they have to be continually thinking about their salaries This is in one sense profoundly true but I believe that it is often the argument under which idlers take refuge 14 Fundamentally a sharp distinction must be recognized between the academic and the adminis trative requirements of the institution This underlies the question at issue The university is required to exist in a commercial world and meet financial conditions on a commercial basis while at the same time it must meet its obliga tions to the ideals for which it stands The uni versity thus is forced to maintain its standards at variant costs and direct its progress by pay ing prices that it does not itself control when they are disproportionate to the true academic returns This is because of the outside standards of value which do not accord with the necessary ones within The discrepancy holds true for every item of expenditure and among the other items are included the salaries There then arise two classes of considerations for which salaries are paid One is that for serv ices which perhaps have little or no commercial value rendered by persons who are thoroughly dependent upon college interests and college standards The other is for services purposely attracted away from commercial competition by liberal payment The two classes or purposes are separate and must be regarded separately for they are made necessary by different causes they administer to different needs and they bring about different results One is strictly academic and the other is thoroughly commercial and each is a factor in practically every salary The true academic purpose is steady con tinuous uninfluenced directly by commercial con siderations and ultimately is desirable Such services are easy to grade Salary in that caseIlBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 251 conforms closely to title and acting with title it becomes an expression of university approval and merit Commercial considerations however can not be bounded so The commercial purpose is fluctu ating insincere in the college field and rests upon a commercial basis and outside standards It is always subject to influence acting on the outside and these break into any desirable order of things within Therefore when necessary commercial influ ences should be met according to their demands not restricting or limiting the power of the uni versity to do this but observing its best interests while protecting its standards The salary is the means that makes the fulfilment in that case possible and is the only compensation the college can afford to offer commercialism It could be shown on the whole to be unwise for a university to go far into extreme commercial competition for men and deal in such commercial margins upon men as have accrued from popularity or from success in some one line of commercial activity Thus salary in part must be held under a com mercial standard while title always must be con sidered under an academic one The two stand ards do not conform and no effort could draw them naturally together in defiance of com mercial law and custom A uniform scale of salaries graded according to title or defined by the title is an ideal to be approached as closely as outside conditions will permit Such uni formity however is not sufficiently supple for working purposes and for practical reasons the best results are obtained by a moderate departure from it in different ways limited not by defined bounds but by conservative administration re taining always the ideal in view 15 Let me say in answer to both questions that I think the same salary should not be paid to men bearing the same title There should be an iden tical minimum salary to be paid to all men bear ing the same title with such additions in individ ual cases as the university may deem wise in order to recognize the moderate natural increase up to a certain limit which ought to be given to all members of the faculty who do faithful serv ice and the exceptional increase which ought to be granted to men of exceptional value 16 The question strikes me as scholastic University organization can not be modeled upon the army The best interest of university service prohibits that it should be enterable only at the bottom University professorships high and low should be open to competition Profess ors do not need the shelter of benevolence nor to be entrenched behind the contract esteem of bene factors Universities should be free to get the best men their resources will command Hence no rigid connection between title and salary roll is advisable 17 I beg to offer as my opinion That the same salary should not be paid to men bearing the same title I feel that in the lower grades of the instructing force different sums should be paid according to the character and amount of work In the grades of instruct ors assistant professors and associate professors I think there should be a minimum and a maxi mum limitthat in general advancements or appointments should be made at the minimum figure and there should be a regular automatic increase in those salaries until the maximum limit is reached then it may be desirable to retain the person at that salary either permanently or for some time until he has shown his qualifications to be raised to the next grade When it comes to the full professorships I think again there should be a minimum salary and that the advancement to what might be termed the regular  salary of full professor should be as in the lower grades automatic and regular that above the regular salary there should be exceptions made upon the sole con sideration of the value of the individual to the university That means discrimination and I believe in discriminating between the good the mediocre and the bad 18 It seems to me the fairest method is that a certain minimum salary should be attached to each title and that the appointment to such a place would necessarily carry with it this mini mum salary but there should be possibilities of individual increase over this minimum The factors which should determine this differential are various The success of the professor in his particular field either as a teacher or as an in vestigator or as a leader of public thought or interest in university activities should be fol lowed by some recognition in the way of increased salary I am afraid that if promotion were simply a matter of time or routine there would be a distinct lowering of effectual effort for ad252 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 vance The more highly one prizes an academic grade the greater should be the possibilities of this differentiation While academic life is not strictly comparative with business life they should have certain analogous elements It is easy to get onethou sanddollar men in business much more difficult to get fivethousanddollar men and almost im possible to get tenthousanddollar men but a tenthousanddollar man is worthy of his hire So in the university the tenthousanddollar man should have his corresponding reward Of course the elements which make for success in an academic career are not the same as in a busi ness career The standards are different the aim is different but what I want to bring out is that the value of men is so different that they can not be fairly classified by the ordinary academic grades and while in the university the money reward is not the sole object of the professors work it should form a certain element of it 19 In my opinion professorships within the same university should unquestionably be placed upon a like financial basis I find the most emphatic argument for this in the evils that almost inevitably accompany any other disposition Those evils indeed seem to me a most serious menace to the amelioration so much neededof the professors standing In the absence of such a system or practise the individual professor is likely to spend serious efforts in enforcing his claims to securing such advances in salary as he can effect Most directly and most frequently he encourages offers of affiliation with other institutions He par ticularly suggests when such inquiries come the necessity of additional financial inducements to secure his transfer at other times the university aspiring to secure his services at once holds out the lure of additional income If he accepts such an offer he is likely to find in the new environ ment that he has been engaged at a salary denied to many of his colleagues of longer serv ice of greater adaptation to the needs of that institution of equal reputation and attainments Such a position should be more generally em barrassing than it seems to be If he declines the overture he is likely to yield to the tempta tion to demand of his present authorities that they compensate him for the loss he has incurred by declining the call The commercial standards that thus enter degrade the proper appreciation of academic standards and prevent the emphasis upon the essential factors of academic compensa tion There are today many men of firstrate character and value receiving most inadequate salaries while in the same faculty are a few men with far better incomes whose greater freedom from care is due merely to the fact that they entered the institution at a later period of its history and have not to their credit years of self sacrificing service Such a university actually punishes those who have aided to build it up It may be replied that this difficulty could be avoided by increasing salaries from within as generally as from without I reply that the spirit of this method is against such procedure and that a complete adjustment would amount to nothing less than an equality of salary I shall say little of the feeling of personal in justice of jealousies small and great proper and improper that arise under the system that allows each man to fight for himself alone I mention the fact that struggle against it as we will men will be rated by the salaries they receive Aca demic democracy is hampered in its expression and men are judged by false standards It is but an exaggerated expression of this attitude something that hangs in the air and contaminates that induced more than one graduate student in a certain but nameless institution to look up in the proper report the salaries of the several professors under whom study was contemplated and to choose those with the largest figures to their credit They wanted their majors only under at least 3000 men This is the rating that figures in the Sunday issues of our great and representative dailies The fact that the only practicable mode of avoiding the inevitable difficulties injustices in equalities and pernicious influences of a system that leads each man to struggle for himself is to adopt the system of equality this alone seems to me an adequate reason for the system I advocate Yet it seems to me that equally with the avoid ance of evils is there in the equality system the greatest good alike in principle and in prac tise The very freedom from care and unrest and uncertainty and the consequent emphasis placed upon the incumbents devoting himself to his proper interests is a great step in itself Nor can I see why any president or board should desire to complicate matters by attempting to dif ferentiate among equally or nearly equally worthy men by a financial standard It is some times said that the business of a president or of a board is to translate academic utility into money values a task for which a composite ofFEBRUARY 15 19071 SCIENCE 253 Solomon Job and Socrates would be inadequate The thing is an obvious impossibility and as said before a crude attempt to force the distinc tion places a most undesirable emphasis upon a distinction that fundamentally has no place in the academic life The very fact that a presi dent is willing to prove to his board that Pro feasor A is worth 2600 to the university while Professor B is worth 2700 seems to suggest rather forcibly that the result might better be left to the throw of a die We must also remember that under present circumstances these discriminations may mean all the vital difference between finding a debit or a credit in the years accounting If professors were paid upon an adequate basis the problem would shift in importance though the relative value of principle would be the same A salary should secure a reasonable comfortable living The salary is intended to permit one to live and pay ones bills those bills are largely determined by the standard of living The butcher and the bakerunlike the graduate studentdo not con sult the salary list before making out their bills These come in to the fortunate and the unfortu nate alike Nor can I see any useful purpose that a differ entiation of salary serves I have never heard any defence thereof that at all aims to set forth its utility It is generally set forth as a prac tical necessity A certain man can be had only by offering him a certain salary Trustees are influenced by these superficially businesslike con siderations and so the specious argument with its attendant evils returns and grows in force Yet in the long run the university that strains its maximum efforts to pay adequate salaries will reap the benefits of its worthier policy Indeed that is the case today To anticipate the occa sion of a summons elsewhere to place the em phasis upon academic privileges to make it clear that the best the university can do is already done and is not withheld until a holdup  forces the situation is more likely to attract and re tain the proper kind of man than any shrewd juggling with the translation of academic deserts into dollars and cents I do not address myself to the practical prob lemrelated yet differentof providing a system for the proper advancement of men from subor dinate to the higher positions I believe the issue in such cases is properly that of determin ing by academic standards when and whether the candidate is to be advanced to a higher rank Some should be advanced more rapidly than others Such differentiation is part of the selec tion that is as necessary in the academic as in any other career But once selected the further differentiation of salary should be affected by no other consideration than time of service and such other regularly provided conditions as belong to every mans career 20 As an ideal the payment of uniform salaries to all who may bear the same title would seem highly desirable inasmuch as it would in effect recognize the equal value or importance of one department with another As a matter of practical university administra tion it will always be difficult to realize any such ideal and chiefly for these reasons 1 While all professors should be equally eminent in their respective professions such will not be the case in any actual faculty Certain individuals may tend to stagnate others to draw forward and in various ways differences are sure to exist 2 As a result of these differences either in professional or in collateral qualifications it will result that in a real sense certain individuals may become of more value than others no matter on what basis value may be estimated Such differences may not improperly be made the basis of a difference in salary 3 Due to one cause or another the services of different members of the same grade of the teach ing staff may have different market values Cer tain individuals may be more or less prominently before the public or may receive calls from other institutions and if it is desired to retain their services an advance in salary must be made To summarize if universities could be provided with ideal faculties and administered under ideal conditions doubtless equality of salary in the same grade should and would prevail Under actual conditions and as a practical administra tive problem it does not seem likely that it ever will 21 I am strongly inclined to think that men bear ing the same title in a given institution should receive the same salary or what would be better if practicable that there should be a fixed scale of advancement by years so that new appointees could start in at the bottom of the scale and receive a regular increase of salary until a cer tain maximum is reached It might be necessary to recognize services in other institutions at simi lar grade in adjusting the pay of men changing254 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 from one full professorship to another To give satisfaction such a sliding scale would have to be administered uniformly and the practise of withholding the expected advance in some cases and in making it in others strictly debarred otherwise members of a faculty would feel them selves perpetually under trial and while this might stimulate a certain feverish activity it would not promote the efficiency of the body as a whole I believe that the healthiest system and the one which would lead to the finest esprit de corps to be that of uniformity of pay the salary in the case of each institution to be of public knowledge A sliding scale of annual increase which could be relied upon would be satisfactory to the younger members of the staff and pecul iarly advantageous to those who remain in service for a long period of years Such a system would do away altogether with the present very objectionable practise of trying to obtain offers from other institutions not for the purpose of accepting the same but to force an increase of salary in the position which one already holds At present this is in many in stitutions the only successful way of improving ones condition as regards pay Such a system as that outlined however should be so arranged as not to altogether discourage migration for aside from mere monetary con siderations it is doubtless better for the univer sities and their professors to have a certain reasonable amount of change of personnel on the one hand and of environment on the other It might possibly be found necessary to pay higher salaries in departments which come into touch with practical life such as the chairs in engineering architecture medicine and law than in the case of purely academic positions because of the demand outside of the universities for men fitted to fill these positions but such a distinc tion is unfortunate and should be avoided if pos sible If a man conversant with practical affairs selects a university career he does so necessarily at a pecuniary sacrifice and it is perhaps not too much to ask him to be content with the same pay as his colleagues in other departments 22 As regards instructors in different schools or perhaps even in different departments of the same school some variation seems necessary Experts in law medicine or engineering even though of no greater relative prominence in their special ties than teachers in the socalled academic de partments of the university must ordinarily be paid higher salaries than other teachers simply because a sufficient number of firstclass men can not be gotten away from the competition of active practice in these subjects for salaries that will procure good teachers in the academic de partments otherwise indeed a university pro poses to pay the academic teachers on the basis necessary for the professional ones which is not likely to be the case I assume therefore that the practical question for discussion is whether there should be variations in the salaries paid to men of the same rank in the same school or similar departments Ordinarily I should think it preferable to pay the same salary to men bear ing the same title and doing work similar in amount and general character Where a univer sitys funds are reasonably adequate to the work it is attempting to do this seems the best way of preventing jealousies and dissatisfactions which are very natural where there are marked dis tinctions in salary among men of the same rank At least this is true among professors and asso ciate professors though the reasons for it are not nearly so strong in the case of temporary appointees like instructors and assistant profes sors A variation of salary within certain limits may here often be proper and useful in enabling the university to retain a good man whom it can not immediately promote to the higher ranks In any case however I should think it proper for a university in rare instances to pay special salaries to men of extraordinary abilities The salary of a professor is not large at best and a university teacher with an opportunity to earn a much larger sum outside of the university might occasionally have duties that he felt obliged to discharge which necessitated a larger income If his value to the university were very great I should think it proper for the university to re tain him by special arrangement but such cases would be very few in number Institutions whose income does not enable them to employ the usual number of full professors at salaries paid for good men by the larger univer sities must necessarily choose between having all the men in a department below the first rank or trying to have at least one firstrate man in each department who shall be paid a substantially higher salary than the others I should think it better for an institution to pursue the latter policy but it would be difficult for such an in stitution to retain its better men even of the second grade if it never advanced any of them to the rank of professor except the heads of de partments The title of professor is looked uponFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 255 by a considerable number of excellent men as a substantial promotion even though unaccompanied by much increase in salary and I should think it proper for a university with a moderate income to act upon this known fact of human nature I am pretty sure it would be able to retain better teachers in the long run this way and that is the principal object to be gained by salary rules Perhaps even such a variation as that just sug gested could be made the subject of regulation by constituting heads of departments a higher class than full professors 23 As there are many different degrees of worth or value to the university among the men of its faculty and as but a limited number of these degrees is represented in the usual scale of titles composing the faculty organization I should say decidedly that the same salary should not neces sarily be paid to men bearing the same title The differences in salary should correspond as nearly as possible and expedient to the differences in degree of worth of the men to the university The factors determining this worth are several and various Some of them appeal primarily to our ideal professional qualifications others ap peal more to our recognition of the practical neces sities of university administration Theoretically the ideal qualifications should be the preferred and most rewarded ones actually both categories of qualifications must be taken into account But there is no scale of degrees of worth determined either on the basis of ideal qualifications alone practical necessities alone or as is inevitably the real basis of a combination of these two that does not include in its series more degrees of gradations of importance than are represented by the conventional scale of faculty titles or positions These degrees should be recognized and rewarded by differences in salary even though they can not be by differences in title 24 I believe there should be a minimum standard of salary for a given title but that the maximum should be varied to suit the class of men engaged in such work Many valuable menr deserve an advance in salary before they deserve promotion in rank in fact some exceedingly helpful men may never deserve a high rank as to title but become increasingly useful as members of the teaching faculty It is my feeling that a pro fessorship should not be awarded simply and solely because of scholarly attainments or ability as an investigator the title has a greater content than these qualifications imply Under the present economic condition the sala ries now being offered to college workers are so meager as to offer no incentive to young men of ability to enter the profession Of course many young men of ability are entering it but they are doing so with no hope of any financial reward and many of them are not conscious of the dif ficulties that await them It is easy to say that the best men are willing to make sacrifices but it is not so easy to see that the sacrifices which they are called upon to make are many times serious detriments to their advancement For example comparatively few men in college work relying wholly on their salaries can afford to hire a stenographer or reader to do certain amounts of detailed and more or less mechanical work This is not as it should be Much more time could be given to investigation and they would have more desire to investigate and de vote their energies to essentials if they could be relieved of the purely mechanical work At present as I say relying wholly upon their sala ries for support this is practically impossible In conclusion people of the country are in general of the opinion that college professors are poorly paid hence there would be no serious ob jection on the part of the public to a change for the better 25 The titles do not represent ranks of men in military alignment but a group of runners spaced out yonder on the track Our hope is to space them out more widely still by evoking from each best one his utmost effort and speed A prize of some sortis what human nature demands in all such cases To him that hath shall be given  is never truer nor more just than here Now the title itself is a prize But the title of itself affords no further inducement to him who has already won it and for those of the highest academic rank no further prize of that sort is possible But this last is precisely the group that most needs such stimulus To rely upon the desire of fame alone to fur nish the needed spur seems to me not quite all we may rightly do Fame depends upon too many accidents and generally comes too late to avail the individual for further effort It seems more over not quite fair that the world generally should be left to pay the debts of the university for exceptional service rendered first of all to the university itself The evils which are feared in this connectionbitterness jealousy and the256 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 charge of favoritismare already here and will inevitably attend any attempt to recognize ex cellence The way to deal with them is neither to efface distinctions already established nor to refuse to carry them further as may be needed but rather to make sure that every such recogni tion of excellence shall carry with it the con viction of its essential justice and desert I see therefore no reason why the principle of special reward for special service operative everywhere else should be made inoperative within the charmed field of a certain academic rank To make it so suggests at once the methods of the I union and its resultsloss of incentive towards excellence because mediocrity will answer just as well And I make no question of recognition of a pecuniary sort Added pecuniary resource here is not so much pay as it is a necessary condition of further and continued effort relieving the scholars mind from carking cares and his body from profitless fatigue and setting free his energy to do its proper work Nor should it be neces sary for a man of proved value and ability to work for a position elsewhere in order to come into the enjoyment of what he has deserved at home A graded use of salary during the two or three years of ones novitiate in the professorshipif the man has it in him to rise at allseems almost the only proper thingand works well in practise The associate professorship seems not so distinctly to need an augmentation since it should lead betimes to the next stage But in the last stage the principle of recognition of ex ceptional quality I think should have large sway 26 In order to answer your question two things must first be clear viz 1 The basis on which salaries are fixed 2 what is implied by the same title As to the first I may express the fairly obvious belief that salaries should be the pecuniary com pensation for services rendered In practise however the salary question is frequently com plicated by the introduction of other matter In fixing salaries the only condition should be  value received Assuming this if the same title truly indicates equal usefulness among the men who hold it I believe that equal salary equal compensation is both logical and just But unless men equal in rank are also equal in usefulness I do not see that equal compensation is justified I may therefore state my opinion regarding your question in these terms Ist Salaries should be compensation for serv ices rendered 2d They should be fixed only according to serv ices rendered 3d The salary of an individual should there fore be determined solely by his usefulness 4th Unequal usefulness of men in the same or in any rank should necessarily imply unequal salary 27 Equality of salaries would presuppose at least approximate equality in scholarship but there are very few universities in this country that have reached that stage In other cases a uni form salary scale would seriously hamper the ap pointing power in its efforts to secure good men especially in universities that are at a disad vantage in consequence of their geographical loca tion or for any other reason unless indeed the salaries be placed at the maximum figure obtain ing anywhere and that is obviously imprac ticable 28 In general I think that it is not just to pay the same salary to all bearing the same title It seems to me that there are at least four reason able grounds for such discrimination 1 Relative success in teaching 2 Relative success in research or in otherwise contributing to knowledge 3 Various personal qualities not easily defined but going to make up character and culture and manifested in the teachers influence for good on the student 4 Length of experience If the teacher does not grow he should not remain in the university If he does develop from year to year in such qualities as those referred to above it is right that he should receive better pay I most emphatically do not believe in salary discrimination based on a commercial valuation obtained from the demand for the teacher by other institutionsa condition which already exists to too large an extent When the laws of supply and demand govern the salaries paid our teachers the influence of our universities for good must certainly suffer We should see such re sults within the faculties as now exist on the campusan able teacher of Latin let us say of high character and long training and successful as a teacher getting perhaps 1000 or 1200 while a recent graduate of doubtful characterFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 257 can command 5000 for six weeks work as foot ball coach 29 I am distinctly of the opinion that we are too careful in differentiating officers of the university according to age and title rather than to ability activity and general usefulness Universities are lax in encouraging young men to leave the university when they are not fitted and at the same time American universities seem to be equally lax and shortsighted in disposing of older men who in their prime were a great help and honor to the university The modern trust is much more humane in these matters and it seems to me takes better care of its good men Salaries should not be paid in amounts propor tionate to arbitrary gradations of title When a man has proved his usefulness to the university the university should be willing to pay him any reasonable salary to retain his services 30 A member of a university faculty is likely to put more life into his work if from time to time he should receive some definite recognition of ex cellence to which he may attain whether in teaching research executive work or length of honorable and efficient service This recognition may come to him in a variety of ways one of which is increased remuneration It is desirable that such encouragement should be given him more often than he could be promoted from title to title for a complex system of titles would be unwieldy Therefore a minimum and maximum salary should be established for each title a man being advanced now within his title now from one title to another as he shall merit In reading this President Jordan made the following comment I may add a word of my own to Pro fessor Stillmans discussion of this topic The problem is rendered more complex through the existence of the assistant pro fessor on whom in great part the work of the American college now falls His torically the assistant professor is a re cent development and his position has no analogue in the universities of England or Germany The fact that the American universities are teaching institutions as distinguished from those whose primary function is that of an examining board has had a large influence in shaping our university organ ization In England and Germany in general there is an established standard of excel lence of erudition or of culture to which the student aspires In framing this standard no consideration is paid to the powers or the tastes of the individual standard It is a standard set by society or by academic tradition and only in late years has the number of such ideals or goals of effort been multiplied In Europe generally the professor teaches what he pleases but the student uses what he teaches only as an aid to a predetermined end The teachers of minor grade find their opportunity when the professor fails to make his work useful as a preparation for examinations If a Privatdocent can make his work attract ive and practical the students will pay for it Otherwise he may starve The university has no responsibility for him no interest in his fate Neither does the uni versity feel any obligation that the sub jects demanded in examination shall be well taught to each individual candidate This is especially true of the older uni versities of England and to this day the chief university function which is unques tioned is that of examining for degrees One and all they are primarily examin ing and not teaching universities In an examining institution fees are charged These fees mostly go to the pro fessor and very unequally but that is his own concern If he is interested in them he should choose a remunerative field The professor needs only assistants of an inferior order These he may pay him self and their status does not concern the university If professor and assistants fail to cover the ground the private tutor covers the rest and for him again the university has no responsibility2 58 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 633 In a teaching university every student must be reached The classes taught must fairly represent the subject and the num bers in each class must not be greater than the teachers can properly handle In the small college under the old regime this work was divided among a group of professors The elective system demands many more teachers and better ones so far as classroom work is concerned than the English system It is in fact the element of choice whether between fixed courses or between courses which is re sponsible for the great extension of the American college system which is now at its height Needing many more teachers without the means of making them all professors and with the opportunity of trying them out before promotion has called into being the great army of assistant professors and others of intermediate grade who do most of the actual work with students in the American colleges and universities today It is manifest that no system of auto matic promotion by which each of these can ever be assured of a professorship in his own institution is possible There will never be professorships enough to go around and even the best men must often look for promotion elsewhere Besides this only a small percentage of these men show that combination of personality char acter scholarship productiveness and force which should make them worthy of first class professorships anywhere In the pro motion of these men the interests of the university or college as a teaching body in other words the interests of the students constitute almost the sole consideration It is a matter of wise administration to allow a reasonable minimum in each grade enough to enable a man to live decently It is well to make a small automatic addi tion to this from year to year It is well that this addition should cease when further promotion is not in the univer sity s own interest It is almost as in jurious to overpay a mediocre man as to give a good man too little The only justification for either is found in the limitations of financial ability and in the absence of means for exact valuation of the achievements and the possibilities of the various instructors The rapid promo tion of exceptional men is under our sys tem a necessity Equal pay under equal conditions considers the position not the man as the unit and it is only possible under static conditions Applied to the American university of today it would leave to the institution only the dregs of the faculty unless its equal pay was held level with the maximum in other institu tions Except in two or three of our strongest universities that course is at present impossible Because the university has assumed re sponsibility for all the necessary teaching and this with the exaction of low fees and in some parts of the country none at all the assistant professor is part of the system as much as the professor At the same time the assistant professorship has risen through necessity not through the volun tary choice of university authorities We are not certain what he ought to be paid how rapidly he should grow or what should be his status in academic matters These matters are mostly determined for us by necessity We have not yet reached agreement as to whether he should have an equal voice or any voice in academic mat ters University legislation usually tends to give him a nearly equal voice regard ing the academic executive as merely first among equals University custom tends to hold the executive responsible for his asso ciates after the fashion of business cor porations There is justice in both points of view and it is well for the universities that the two tendencies should continueFEBRUARY 15 1907 SCIENCE 259 to strive with each other But the final outcome will be that the president of the university will be the executive representa tive or spokesman not the ruler of the faculty and the department head will stand in similar relations to his fellows Meanwhile the title is an academic honor the salary a practical means to an end and so long as our universities are in process of formation the two will not bear any automatic or static relation to each other

OBSERVED GO TOGETHER IN THAT WHICH SEEMS THE COMMON TRUNK LIKE A BUNCH OF THREDS WHICH AF TER SEPARATE AND ARE VARIOUSLY DIVARICATED AND THESE NERVS BEING CUT SHRINK UP AS THE VEINS OF PLANTS AS MUCH OR MORE THAN DO THE VEINS OR ARTERIES OF ANIMALS DR WILLIS OBSERVES ALSO THAT THERE ARE TWO SORTS OF NERVES ONE ARISING FROM THE CEREBRUM SUBSERVIENT TO VOLUNTARY MOTI ONS AND OF WHICH WE ARE

FOREGOING INTIMATIONSPARTLY COMMUNICATING SOME ANATOMICAL OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS CONCERNING THE UNALTERABLE CHARACTER OF THE WHITENESS OF THE CHYLE WITHIN THE LACTEOUS VEINS TOGETHER WITH DIVERS PARTICULAR S OBSERVED IN THE GUTSESPECIALLY SEVERAL SORTS OF WORMS FOUND IN THEM I COME TO YOUR LETTER WHERE THE ANALOGY BETWIXT THE VEINS IN PLANTS AND THE NERVES IN ANIMALS HIN TED BY DR WALLIS IS A CONSIDERABLE NOTION AND I SHALL SET MY SELF A TASK ERE LONG TO EXAMINE THEM BOTH AGAIN ON PURPOSE AND TO GIVE YOU MY THOUGHTS IN THE MEAN TIME I WILL EN TERTAIN6061 TERTAIN YOU IF YOU PLEASE WITH SOME ANATOMICAL OBSERVATION AND EXPERIMENTS IT HATH BEEN LONG IN MY THOUGHTS AND DESIRES TO HAVE DISCO VERED THE ACTUAL PASSAGE OF THE CHYLE INTO THE LACTEOUS VEINS OF WHICH YET I NEVER DOUBTED AS I FIND SOME DO AT THIS DAY THE DIFFICULTY LYES IN THE CERTAIN AND UNALTERABLE CHARACTER OF THE CHYLES WHITENESS ESPECIALLY WHEN RECEIVED INTO THOSE VEINS AND YET IT IS AS CERTAIN THAT IN A DIABETES THE URINE RE TAINS ALL THE QUALITIES OF THE LIQUOR DRUNK ALSO IN THAT FAMOUS INSTANCE OF THOSE THAT EAT THE FRUIT CALLD THE PRICKLEPEAR IF I REMEMBER ARIGHT THEIR URINE HATH AFFRIGHTED THE EATER WITH THE COLOUR OF BLOUD THAT IS WITH THE NOTALTERD CO LOR OF THE JUICE OF THE FRUIT IN THESE INSTANCES AT LEAST WE CANNOT DOUBT BUT THE CHYLE EVEN IN THE LACTEOUS VEINS WAS QUALIFIED ACCORDING TO THE FOOD AND DRINK TO EFFECT THEN SOMETHING TO THIS PURPOSE WE HAVE FORMER LYAND THAT VERY OFTEN REPEATED THE EXPERIMENT OF INJECTING HIGHLY TINGED LIQUORS INTO THE GUTS OF A LIVE ANIMAL IT WOULD BE TOO TEDIOUS AND IMPERTINENT TO WRITE DOWN THE CIRCUM STANCES OF MANY DIFFERENT TRYALS WE WILL ONLY IN SHORT TELL YOU THE MANNER OF PERFORMING IT AND THE SUCCESS WE LACED THE SKIN OF THE ABDOMEN OF A DOG LOOSLY FOR A HANDS BREADTH AND THEN OPENING IT UNDERNEATH THE STITCHES WE TOOK OUT EITHER THE DUODENUM OR ANY OTHER PART OF THE TE NUIA INTESTINA THE GUT TOOK OUT WE OPEND WITH A VERY SMALL ORIFICEAND HAVING READY THE TINGED LIQUOR LUKEWARM WE TOOK IT UPWARD AND DOWNWARD CAREFULLY STITCHING UP THE GUTAND THEN DRAWING THE LACE WE UNLOOSED TWO OF THE DOGS FEET LAYING HIM ON HIS SIDE FOR WHAT TIME WE THOUGHT CONVENIENT THE TINGED LIQUORS WE USED WERE GOOD BARBA DOS INDIGO IN FAIR WATER AND FILTRATED ALSO LUMPS OF INDIGO THRUST DOWN HIS THROAT GOOD BROATH AS THEY CALL IT OF A BLEW FAT INDIGO IN MILK SAFFRON IN MILK AGAIN WE TRIED IN SOME DOGS FED BEFORE HAND AND INJECTED THE LIQUORS IN THE VERY HEIGHT OF THE CHYLES DISTRIBUTIONINTO OTHERS YET FASTING AND THAT FOR A LONGER OR SHORTER TIME THE SUCCESS WAS SO CONSTANT THAT WE CANNOT SAY WE EVER DID FIND THE LEAST DISCOLOURING OF THE CHYLE ON THE OTHER SIDE K K K K K K  THE6062 THE GUTS THAT ISTHE WITHIN LACTEOUS VEINSBUT EVER WHITE AND UNIFORM WHENCE WE JUDGE IT NOT VERY FEASABLE TO TINGE THE VE NAL CHYLE IN A WELL AND FOUND ANIMAL AND HE THAT WOULD DEMONSTRATE THE MATTER OF FACT TO THE EYE MUST PROBABLY DO IT BY GIVING HIM SOME SUCH THING IN THE FOOD AS SHALL CAUSE A DIABETES OR SOME DISTEMPER EQUIVALENT TO IT THOUGH WE HAVE OBSERVD MANY ODD THINGS IN THE SEVERAL EXERCISES OF THIS NATURE YET WE SHALL NOT TROUBLE YOU AT PRE SENT WITH ANY OTHER PARTICULARS THAN WHAT WE HAVE FURTHER OBSERVD IN THE GUTS TO WHICH WE SHALL CONFINE OUR PAPER OF THESE WE SHALL PROCEED TO SPEAK THOUGH POSSIBLY THE THINGS MAY BE BETTER KNOWN TO YOU ALREADY AS 1 OF THE GLANDULAE MILIARES OF THE SMALL GUTS WHICH MAY ALSO IN SOME ANIMALS BE WELL CALLD FRAGIFORMES FROM THE FIGURE OF THE ONE HALF OF A STRAWBERRY AND WHICH YET I TAKE TO BE EXCRETIVE GLANDULS BECAUSE CONGLOMERATE 2 THE USE OF THE INTESTINUM CAECUM SUBSERVIENT TO THAT OF THE COLON AND RECTUM MANIFEST IN SUCH ANIMALS WHERE NA TURE INTENDS A CERTAIN AND DETERMINATE FIGURE TO THE EXCRE MENTS 3 OF SOME SORTS OF VER MIN WE FOUND IN THE GUTS AND FIRST OF THE LUMBRICI LATI OR TAPE WORMS OF THESE I SAY WE FOUND IN THE GUTS OF ONE DOG PERHAPS MORE THAN AN HUNDRED IN ALL THE DUOD NUM WAS EXCEEDINGLY STUFFED OUT AND EX TENDED WITH THEM WHICH ALSO WELL AGREES WITH AN OTHER OBSERVATION I MADE IN A MOUSE WHERE I FOUND THE DUODENUM TO BE FAR BIGGER THAN THE STOMACH IT SELF BY REASON OF THE GREAT NUMBERS OF THESE WORMS FOR KIND WHICH WERE CONTAI NED IN IT FOR KIND I SAY FOR THESE TAPEWORMS WERE OF A QUITE DIFFERENT SHAPE FROM THOSE OF THE DOG OR ANY THAT I HAVE EVER YET SEEN TO PROCEED WE FOUND THEM ALSO IN THE DOGS JEJUNUM AND ILEON BUT NOT ANY ONE LOWER THAN THE VALVULA COLI NOR ANY HIGHER THAN THE DUODENUM OR WITHIN THE PILORUS BELOW THE DUODENUM THEY LAY AT CERTAIN DISTANCES ONE FROM ANOTHER THOUGH SOMETIMES BY PAIRS OR MORE OF THEM TWISTED TOGETHER NEAR THEM WAS CONSTANTLY TO BE OBSERVED AN EX CREMENT OF THEIR OWN DISTINCT FOR COLOUR MORE GREY AND CONSISTENCE FROM THE CHYLE THE OBSERVATION BEING MADE IN6063 IN A DOG PLENTIFULLY FED FOR OTHER PURPOSES JUST AS WE FIND IN WORM EATEN TRACKS OF WOOD WHERE THE COSSI LEAVE BEHIND THEM THE WOOD WHICH HATH PASSD THROUGH THEIR BODIES THESE WORMS LAY MOSTLY WITH THE SMALL ENDS UPWARD AS FEEDING UP ON AND EXPECTING THE CHYLE IN ITS DESCENT THESE LUMBRICI LATI WERE NONE OF THEM ABOVE ONE FOOT LONG AND MOST OF THEM OF AN EQUAL LENGTH AND BIGNESS THE ONE END WAS AS BROAD AS MY LITTLE FINGERNAIL AND POINTED LIKE A LANCET THE OTHER END COMING SMALL GRADUALLY FOR THE THIRD PART OF THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE ANIMAL WAS KNOTTD OR ENDED IN A SMALL BUTTON LIKE A PINHEAD THEY WERE EVERYWHERE AND IN ALL PARTS OF THEM ALIKE MILK WHITE OF A FLAT AND THIN SUBSTANCE LIKE FINE TAPE DIVIDED INTO INFINITE RINGS AND INCISURES EACH INCI SURE HAVING SHARP ANGLES ON BOTH SIDES LOOKING TO THE BROADER END STANDING OUT BEYOND EACH OTHER FROM WHICH ALSO I TAKE THE SMALL END TO BE THE HEAD ELSE THE SHARP CORNERS OF THE ANNULI WOULD NECESSARILY HINDER THE ASCENT OF THE ANIMAL WHEREAS IF THE CONTRARY BE TRUE THEY SERVE TO KEEP IT UP EACH RING HATH ALSO ON THE ONE SIDE ONLY AND THAT ALTERNATELY ONE SMALL PROTUBERANCEMUCH LIKE THE MIDLE FEET OF THE BODY OF SOME CATERPILLERS AFTER I HAVE THUS DESCRIBED THEM TO YOU I DESIRE YOU TO VIEW THE CUT OF TULPIUS IN THE LAST YEARS EDITION OF HIS MEDIC OBSERVAT L 2 C 42 WHERE HE RETRACTS THE FIRST FIGURE GIVEN US IN THE EDITION OF THAT BOOK IN THE YEAR 1652 AND YET I CAN NOT SAY THAT ALL IN THIS LAST IS TRUE FOR TO ME THE RICTUS AND EYE IN THE THERE SUPPOSED HEAD OF THE ANIMAL SEEM TO BE THE MEER FANCIES OF THE PAINTER NOT TO SAY THAT PROBABLY THE SMALLER END IS THE HEAD WHICH INDEED IS IN THIS CUT WHOLLY NEGLECTED COMPARING OUR ANIMALS WITH THAT CUT OF TULPI US IT WAS NOT VERY EASY FOR ME TO OBSERVE BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RESEMBLANCE THE SPECIFICK DIFFERENCE OF THE LUMBRICI LA TI OF MEN AND THOSE OF THIS ANIMAL I WAS NOT SO HAPPY AS TO DISCOVER ANY MOTION IN ANY PART OF THEM IN WATER OR OUT OF IT NOR DID THEY SEEM IF PRICKED OR OTHERWISE HURT MUCH IF AT ALL TO CONTRACT THEMSELVES OR SHORTEN THE ANNULI SO THAT THEY THEN APPEARD TO ME AS THINGS WITHOUT MOTION OR SENSE THERE6064 THERE IS AN OTHER SORT OF LUMBRICI LATI TO BE MET WITH VERY FREQUENTLY ALSO IN DOGS CALLED CUCURBITINI FROM THE LIKENESS EACH ANNULUS OR LINK HATH TO A CUCUMBER SEED I HAVE FOUND OF THEM ABOUT HALF A FOOT LONGBUT MORE OFTEN BROKEN INTO SHOR TER PIECES THE FORMER BY US DESCRIBED IS UNDOUBTEILY A COM PLEAT AND ENTIRE ANIMAL BUT THERE IS GREAT REASON OF SUSPITI ON THAT THIS IS A CHAIN OF MANY ANIMALS LINKED TOGETHER THESE ANIMALS FOR KIND HAVE BEEN OBSERVED TO HAVE BEEN VOIDED BY MENAND FOUND ENCLOSED IN A GUT OR MEMBRANE OF A PRO DIGIOUS LENGTH AND WHICH YET IS MORE NOTABLE A PERSON OF GREAT INTEGRITY AND WORTH MRTI AFFIRMED TO METHAT HE ONCE ASSISTED AT THE OPENING OF A DOGIN WHICH ONE OF THE KIDNEYS WAS OBSERVED TO BE QUITE WASTED AND BECOME A PERFECT BLAD DERAND IN THAT BLADDER THEY FOUND SOMETHING LIKE AN ANIMAL OF A MONSTROUS SHAPEWHICH BEING DISSECTED WAS NOTHING ELSE BUT A SKIN FULL OF THESE LUMBRICI CUCURBITINI IT WERE TO BE DESIRED THAT SUCH AS HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OF SUCH NEW PHAENOMENA AS OF SNAKES LIZARDS BEETLESCATTERPILLERS TOADS AND SUCH LIKE THINGS AS WE READ OF IN MEDICINAL HISTORIES TO HAVE BEEN VOI DED OR FOUND IN ANY PART OF THE BODY WOULD CAREFULLY EXA MINE WHETHER THEY ARE NOT THE LIKE DISGUISES OF THIS SORT OF WORMS MUCH ASSISTED BY THE SURPRISED FANCIES OF THE FIRST OBSERVERS AND BECAUSE THESE SORT OF WORMES ARE SOMETIMES SAID TO BE FOUND OUT OF THE GUTS THEIR MOST PROPER PLACE WE SHALL CON CLUDE WITH A VERY RECENT OBSERVATION OF THE LAST MONTH IN THIS CITY A CHIRURGION BROUGHT ME ABOUT 20 WORMS WHICH HE HAD JUST THEN TAKEN OUT OF AN ULCERATED ANCLE OF A GIRLE OF A BOUT EIGHT YEARS OLDI HAD THE CURIOSITY TO GO MY SELF AND SEE IT I FOUND THE LEG SOUND ALL BUT THE ANKLE WHICH WAS VASTLY SWELID AND THE GIRLE OTHERWISE HEARTY AND WELL COLOURED SHE HAD BEEN IN GREAT MISERY FOR SOME MONTHS HAD BEEN SENT UP TO LONDON WHERE SHE WAS TOUCHED AND DRESSED FOR THE E VII SOMETIMES AFTER HER RETURN HER PAIN CONTINUING A YOUNG PUPPY WAS OPENED AND APPLYED TO THE SOARS THE CHIRURGEON WHO TOOK OF THE PUPPY FOUND IT TO HIS GREAT ADMIRATION FULL OF WORMSAT LEAST 60 IN NUMBER WHAT THOSE HE FOUND IN THE BODY OF THE PUPPY AND WHAT HE DREW OUT OF THE SOAR ANKLE INTO6065 INTO WHICH HE SAID THEY CRAWLED DOWN AS WORMS DO INTO THE GROUND THE SAME PUPPY WAS AGAIN APPLYED AND IT WAS THEN AT THE SECOND TAKING OFF OF THE PUPPY THAT I MADE THE VI SIT AND SAW ONLY ONE WORM GOT OUT INTO THE PUPPY BUT A VE RY LIVE AND STIRRING ONE MANY WERE AFTERWARDS KILLD BY IN JECTIONS THESE WORMS I AFFIRMACCORDING TO MY BESTKNOWLEDG AND I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING THEM WERE OF THE VERY SPECIES OF THE LUMBRICI TERETESWHICH CHILDREN FAMILIAR LY VOID FROM THE GUTS THEY WERE BETWIXT THREE AND FOUR INCHES LONG ALL ABOUT THE MATTER OF AN EQUAL BIGNESS AS OF ONE BROOD SOMETHING THICKER THAN A DUCKS QUILL VERY SHARP AT BOTH ENDS STIFF AND EXACTLY ROUND WITHOUT INCISURES VI SIBLE AT LEASTAND YET COULD MOVE AND TWIST THEMSELVES READI LY ENOUGH ALL THE DIFFERENCE WAS IN THE COLOUR THESE BEING MUCH WHITER THAN ANY I HAVE SEEN FROM THE GUTS VID BARTHOL IN HIST 60 CENT5 WHERE NEER TWENTY WORMS AS LONG AS MY FINGER WERE FOUND IN A LADYS ARM PROBABLY OF THIS SPECIES TOO I BEG YOUR PARDON FOR MY C

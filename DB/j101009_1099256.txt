RENDERED OUT OF WHICH THE CONTROVERSY BEFORE US HAS ARISEN FROM THAT DECREE IT APPEARS THAT SALES HAD BEEN MADE WHICH PRODUCED THE SUM OF 3300000 AS OF NOVEMBER 1 1878 IT ALSO APPEARS THAT THE LIENS UPON THAT FUND AS OF THAT DATE PARAMOUNT TO THE MARRIAGE CON TRACT AMOUNTED TO 1765419 THAT THE CLAIM OF MRS HARRIS PRO VIDED FOR IN THE CONTRACT AMOUNTED TO 809121 THAT THE DEBTS OF 1895 591VIRGINIA

IN THE YEAR 1879 LEAVING NO ISSUE OF HER MARRIAGE IT APPEARS THAT J W HARRIS AND MARGARET A HARRIS WERE NEVER MADE PARTIES TO EITHER OF THESE SUITS UNTIL THE NOVEMBER TERM 1880 OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF AUGUSTA COUNTY WHEN THEY WERE ADMITTED AS PARTIES DEFENDANT ON THE 14TH DAY OF DECEMBER 1883 THEY FILED THEIR PETITION ASKING THAT THE DECREE OF DECEMBER 1878 MIGHT FOR REASONS SET OUT AT LARGE IN

WHILE THE REMAINDER OVER TO THEM AS PROVIDED FOR IN THE THIRD CLAUSE OF THE MARRIAGE CONTRACT BEFORE REFERRED TO WAS VOLUN TARY AS TO CREDITORS OF MARSHALL MCCUE MORE THAT FIVE YEARS HAVING ELAPSED SINCE THE RECORDATION OF THE CONTRACT WITHOUT ANY PROCEEDINGS BEING TAKEN TO IMPEACH THE SAME IT COULD NOT THEN BE DONE ON THE PLEADINGS IN THE CAUSE AND DECLARED THE DECREE OF DECEMBER 5 1878 TO BE ERRONEOUS IN SO FAR AS IT GAVE TO THE CREDITORS OF MARTHA J MC CUE THE SUM OF 540434 IT DIRECTED THAT THE INCOME UPON THAT SUM TOGETHER WITH THAT ARISING FROM THE 176387 SHOULD BE PAID TO THE CREDITORS OF J MARSHALL MCCUE DURING HIS LIFETIME AND THE ENTIRE CORPUS THEREOF TO PASS TO JOHN W HARRIS AND MARGARET A HARRIS AT HIS DEATH FROM THAT DECREE AN APPEAL WAS TAKEN TO THIS COURT WHICH ON THE 28TH OF APRIL 1890 ENTERED A DECREE AFFIRMING THE DECREE OF JUNE 13 1888 SO FAR ONLY AS THAT DECREE RELATES TO THE ITEM OF 176387 MENTIONED IN THE PETITION FOR REHEARING OF THE DECREE OF DECEMBER 5 1878 FILED BY J W AND MARGARET A HARRIS LEAVING ALL OTHER DEC 592BUMGARDNER V HARRIS QUESTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE SAID DECREES OPEN FOR SUCH FUTURE ADJUDICA TION OF THE CIRCUIT COURT AS TO THAT COURT MAY SEEM PROPER WHEN THAT DECREE WAS RECEIVED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT IT ENTERED THE DECREE OF MAY 19 1890 REFERRING THE CAUSE TO A COMMLSSIONER TO TAKE CERTAIN ACCOUNTS DIRECTED BY THE DECREES OF DECEMBER 1878 AND JUNE 1888 THE COMMISSIONER MADE A REPORT DATED APRIL 16 1892 IN WHICH HE ASCERTAINED THE SEVERAL DEBTS DUE TO THOSE CLAIMING THIS FUND ADVERSELY TO THE HARRISES AND AFTER DISCUSSING THE QUESTIONS OF LAW AND FACT AT LARGE UPON WHICH THE RIGHTS OF THE CLAIMANTS AND OF THE CREDITORS APPEARED IN HIS JUDGMENT TO REST HE REPORTED AGAINST THE CLAIMS OF THE CREDITORS AND WHOLLY IN FAVOR OF THE PETITIONERS SUBSEQUENTLY COUNSEL REPRESENTING MARGARET A HARRIS AND THE AD MINISTRATOR OF HER BROTHER THEN DECEASED FILED AN AMENDED AND SUP PLEMENTAL PETITION FOR THE REHEARING OF THE INTERLOCUTORY DECREE OF DECEMBER 5 1878 CLAIMING IN TERMS THAT THAT DECREE AS TO THEM SHOULD BE WHOLLY REVIEWED AND REVERSED AND ASKING SPECIFICALLY THAT THE SUM OF 540434 BE DECREED TO THEM IN ADDITION TO THE 176387 A C SNYDER ASSIGNEE OF F J SNYDER AND J W CRAWFORD ALSO FILED A PETITION ATTACKING THE SETTLEMENT OF MAY 26 1867 IN SO FAR AS IT UNDERTOOK TO VEST ANY PART OF THE ESTATE THEREBY CONVEYED IN TH CHILDREN OF ELIZA A HARRIS AS BEING FRAUDULENT IN FACT AND VOID HAVING BEEN MADE WITH INTENT TO HINDER DELAY AND DEFRAUD THE CRED ITORS OF THE GRANTOR THE COMMISSIONER HAVING FILED HIS REPORT CALLED FOR BY THE DECREE OF MAY 19 1890 THE CAUSE CAME ON AGAIN TO BE HEARD BEFORE THE CIRCUIT COURT UPON THE REPORT AND THE PETITION OF THE HARRISES AND THE DE MURRER AND ANSWER OF THE CREDITORS THERETO AND UPON THE PETITION OF THE CREDITORS AND THE DEMURRER AND ANSWER OF MARGARET A HARRIS AND THE ADMINISTRATOR OF JOHN W HARRIS THERETO AND BEING CONSIDERED BY THE COURT THE PETITION OF MARGARET A HARRIS AND THE ADMINISTRATOR OF JOHN W HARRIS WAS DISMISSED AS UNNECESSARY AND THE PETITION OF CRAWFORD AND SNYDER WAS DISMISSED AS IMPROPER AFTER SUCH A LONG LAPSE OF TIME AND DEATH OF PARTIES THE COURT THEN PROCEEDED TO DISPOSE OF THE MATTERS IN CONTROVERSY BY GIVING TO MARGARET A HARRIS AND THE ADMINISTRATOR OF JOHN W HARRIS ALL THE RELIEF ASKED FOR IN THEIR PETITION SO FAR AS THE DEED OF MAY 25 1867 UNDERTAKES TO MAKE A SETTLE MENT UPON MARTHA J MCCUE AND THE CHILDREN OF THE MARRIAGE WHICH SHE WAS THEN ABOUT TO SOLEMNIZE WITH THE GRANTOR J MARSHALL MCCUE IT RESTS UPON A CONSIDERATION DEEMED VALUABLE IN LAW AND ITS VALIDITY 1895 593VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER CANNOT BE SUCCESSFULLY ASSAILED AND IS IN NO WAY QUESTIONED IN THIS RECORD IN SO FAR HOWEVER AS THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT UNDERTOOK TO CONVEY THE PROPERTY OF THE GRANTOR TO HIS SISTER ELIZA A HARRIS AND HER CHILDREN IT WAS WITHOUT VALUABLE CONSIDERATION AND VOID NOT HAVING BEEN ATTACKED HOWEVER AS VOLUNTARY WITHIN THE FIVE YEARS PRE SCRIBED BY THE STATUTE IT CANNOT NOW BE ATTACKED FOR THAT CAUSE ONLY THERE IS HOWEVER NO LIMITATION BY STATUTE UPON THE RIGHT OF A CREDITOR TO INSTITUTE A SUIT TO ATTACK A DEED AS FRAUDULENT IN FACT OF COURSE THE RIGHT TO INSTITUTE SUCH A SUIT CAN BE LOST IN EQUITY BY REMISSNESS AND DELAY IN ITS ASSERTION IT IS TRUE THAT DELAY IN THE ASSERTION OF A RIGHT IS ALWAYS DISCOUNTENANCED IN A COURT OF CHANCERY THAT IT DOES NOT EN COURAGE STALE CLAIMS AND THAT A PARTY MAY LOSE HIS RIGHT TO COMPLAIN OF A FRAUD BY DELAY ESPECIALLY WHERE THE DELAY IS ACCOMPANIED BY THE LOSS OF EVIDENCE OR THE DEATH OF PARTIES ORSUCH CONDITIONS EXIST AS TO RENDER THE COURT UNABLE TO PASS UPON THE QUESTIONS INVOLVED WITHOUT SERIOUS RISK OF DOING INJUSTICE IN THIS CASE AS WE HAVE SEEN THE SETTLEMENTS UPON MRS MCCUE AND HER CHILDREN RESTED UPON A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION WHICH COULD NOT BE SUCCESSFULLY IMPEACHED SHE DIED IN 1879 WITHOUT ISSUE AND THEN THE CREDITORS WHO ARE NOW SEEKING THE FUND UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE COURT WERE IN A POSITION TO ASSERT THEIR DEMANDS BUT AT THAT TIME THE DECREE OF DECEMBER 1878 WAS IN FULL FORCE AND VIGOR AND UNDER IT THEY WERE GIVEN ALL THAT THEY HAD A RIGHT TO DENAND THEIR RIGHTS UNDER THAT DECREE WERE NOT DISTURBED UNTIL IT WAS SET ASIDE IN 1888 UPON A PETITION FILED IN 1883 THE CREDITORS THEREFORE HAD NO MOTIVE UNTIL JUNE 1888 TO ATTACK THE DEED OF 1867 AS BEING FRAUDULENT BECAUSE THE COURT BY THE DECREE OF 1878 HAD GIVEN TO THEM EVERYTHING WHICH THEY COULD WITH PROPRIETY CLAIM HAD THAT DEED BEEN SUCCESSFULLY AS SAILED UPON THE GROUND NOW SET OUT IN THEIR PETITION IT IS TRUE THAT MANY YEARS HAVE ELAPSED BUT WE CANNOT SEE FROM THIS RECORD THAT THE LAPSE OF TIME OR THE DEATH OF PARTIES HAS RENDERED THESE TRANSACTIONS OBSCURE OR THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE AT ALL DOUBTFIL OR DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WE THINK IT SUFFICIENTLY APPEARS FROM THE RECORD IN THIS CAUSE THAT THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT IN RESPECT TO THE PROPERTY CONVEYED TO MRS HARRIS AND HER CHILDREN WAS MADE TO HINDER DELAY AND DEFRAUD CRED ITORS WAS AS TO THEM FRAUDULENT IN FACT AND THEREFORE VOID THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES DISCLOSED THE CREDITORS ARE NOT BARRED FROM ASSERTING THEIR RIGHTS TO THE PROPERTY SO CONVEYED AND THAT THE PETITION OF THE APPELLANTS A C SNYDER AND JAMES W CRAWFORD SHOULD HAVE BEEN ENTERTAINED AND THE RELIEF THEREIN PRAYED SHOULD HAVE BEEN GRANTED DEC 594BUMGARDNER V HARRIS WITH RESPECT TO THE OTHER APPELLANTS WHO DID NOT UNITE IN THAT PETI TION THE DECREE COMPLAINED OF MUST BE AFFIRMED THEY HAVE NOT AS SAILED THE DEED AS FRAUDULENT AND CANNOT THEREFORE RECOVER UPON THE PLEADINGS MADE BY THEM FOR AS TO THEM THIS RECORD STANDS JUST AS IT DID WHEN THE CASE WAS IN THIS COURT UPON THE FORMER APPEAL WHEN THIS COURT HELD JUDGE LEWIS DELIVERING THE OPINION THAT THERE BEING NO CHARGE OF ACTUAL FRAUD THERE WAS NO CASE MADE UPON WHICH THE CRED ITORS COULD RECOVER AS AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF E A HARRIS CLAIMING UNDER THE DEED OF MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT AS WE HAVE SEEN THE DECREE ENTERED IN THIS COURT AT THAT TIME IN THE FIRST INSTANCE WAS A GENERAL AFFIRMANCE OF THE DECREE APPEALED FROM OBVIOUSLY AT THE INSTANCE OF THE SAME CREDITORS WHO ARE THE APPELLANTS BEFORE US NOW THAT DECREE WAS SO MODIFIED AS TO LEAVE THE CONTROVERSY AS TO THE FUND WHICH WE HAVE HAD UNDER INVESTIGATION OPEN TO BE DISPOSED OF AS TO THE CIRCUIT COURT MIGHT SEEM BEST THE OBJECT UNDOUBTEDLY BEING TO GIVE TO THE AP PELLANTS THE OPPORTUNITY OF TAKING THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ASSAIL THE SET TLEMENT OF MAY 1867 AS FRAUDULENT IN FACT OF THE OPPORTUNITY THUS AFFORDED ONLY TWO OF THE CREDITORS HAVE AVAILED THEMSELVES AND THE OTHERS HAVING FAILED TO DO SO MUST SUBMIT TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF THEIR OMISSION THE DECREE APPEALED FROM WAS A FINAL ADJUDICATION OF ALL THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE AND IT CORRECTLY DISPOSED OF THEM ALL EXCEPT IN THE PARTICULAR IN WHICH TO US IT HAS SEEMED TO BE ERRONEOUS WE ARE THEREFORE OF OPINION THAT FOR THIS CAUSE ONLY IT SHOULD BE RE VERSED AND THAT IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS IT SHOULD BE AFFIRMED AND THIS COURT PROCEEDING TO ENTER SUCH DECREE AS THE CIRCUIT COURT OUGHT TO HAVE ENTERED IT IS DECREED THAT J W CRAWFORD RECOVER THE SUM OF 57432 WITH INTEREST THEREON FROM OCTOBER 1 1866 SUBJECT TO A CREDIT FOR WHATEVER SUMS OF MONEY MAY HAVE BEEN PAID THEREON THAT THE APPELLANT A C SNYDER RECOVER 140268 WITH INTEREST FROM MARCH 7 1869 SUBJECT TO CREDITS FOR ANY SUMS PAID SINCE THAT TIME WHICH SAID SEVERAL SUMS ARE TO BE PAID OUT OF THLE FUND UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE CIRCUIT COURT IN THIS CAUSE AND THEIR COSTS AND THAT W D REY NOLDS ADMINISTRATOR OF JOHN W HARRIS AND MARGARET A HARRIS RE COVER OF THE APPELLANTS OTHER THAN A C SNYDER AND J W CRAWFORD THEIR COSTS IN THIS BEHALF EXPENDED REVERSED IN PART AND AFFIRMED IN PART BY THE EDITORTHIS CASE GIVES OCCASION TO NOTE THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAW AS IT EXISTED PRIOR TO MAY 1 1888 WHEN THE PRESENT CODE TOOK EFFECT AND THE LAW AS IT IS NOW AS TO MARRIAGE BEING A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION FOR 1895 595VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER AN ANTENUPTIAL SETTLEMENT AT COMMON LAW A SETTLEMENT IN CONSIDERATION OF A CONTEMPLATED MARRIAGE AFTERWARDS HAD IF BONAFIDE WAS UPHELD AS ON A VALUABLE CONSIDERATION AND THE GRANTEE AND BENEFICIARIES WERE REGARDED AND TREATED AS PURCHASERS FOR VALUE AND WERE PROTECTED AS SUCH PURCHASERS UNDER THE STATUTE OF FRAUDULENT CONVEYANCES HENCE ALTHOUGH THE GRANTOR MIGHT HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF FRAUD IN THE TRANSACTION THE GRANTEE AND THOSE CLAIMING UNDER THE SETTLEMENT WERE NOT AFFECTED BY THE GRANTORS FRAUDULENT INTENT UNLESS KNOWLEDGE OF THAT INTENT WAS BROUGHT HOME TO THEM AT OR BEFORE THE TIME OF THE SETTLEMENT OR AFTER THE SETTLEMENT AND BEFORE THE MARRIAGE THIS RULE OPERATED MOST HARSHLY AND UNJUSTLY AGAINST THE SETTLERS CREDITORS WITHDRAWING FROM THEIR CLAIMS THE PROPERTY UPON WHICH THEY HAD GIVEN CREDIT AND TURNING IT OVER TO OTHERS WHO PAID NOTHING FOR IT THE VIRGINIA COURT OF APPEALS FOLLOWED THE ESTABLISHED RULE SEE COUTTS V GREENHOLZ 2 MUNF 363 HERRING V WICKKHAM 29 GRATT 628 CLAY V WALTEL 79 VA 92 LMOORE V BUTLER 90 VA 683 IN THE ELABORATE AND VERY ABLE OPINION OF JUDGE STAPLES IN HERRING V WICKHAM SPEAKING OF THE RULE HE TOOK OCCASION TO SAY THAT THE WHOLE SUBJECT NEEDS THE ATTENTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT A REMARK EMPHASIZED IN THE SUBSEQUENT CASE OF TRIPLETT V RONMINE 33 GRATT ATOP 659 THE SUBJECT DID RECEIVE THE ATTENTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE DEPARTMENT AT THE LATE REVISION OF OUR STATUTE LAW AND THE COMMON LAW RULE WAS CHANGED BY PUTTING THESE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENTS IN THE CLASS OF VOLUNTARY CONVEYANCES AND DECLARING THEM  VOID AS TO CREDITORS WHOSE DEBTS SHALL HAVE BEEN CONTRACTED AT THE TIME THE SETTLEMENTS WERE MADE CODE SEC 2459 COMPARE WITH CORRESPONDING SEC OF CODE OF 1849 IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THE SETTLEMENT ON MARTHA J MCCUE WAS MADE IN 1867 AND THEREFORE WAS ON A CONSIDERATION THEN DEEMED VALUABLE IN LAW BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE IF THE SETTLEMENT HAD BEEN MADE UNDER THE PRESENT CODE IT IS ADJUDGED IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THAT IN SO FAR AS THE MARRIAGE SETTLEMENT UNDERTOOK TO CONVEY THE PROPERTY OF THE GRANTOR TO HIS SISTER ELIZA A HARRIS AND HER CHILDREN IT WAS WITHOUT VALUABLE CONSIDERATION AND VOID THE COURT EVI DENTLY MEANS THAT IT WAS VOID AS TO THE GRANTORS CREDITORS FOR IT WAS CLEARLY VALID AS BETWEEN THE PARTIES IT HAD ALREADY BEEN DECIDED IN VIRGINIA THAT IN ANTE NUPTIAL SETTLEMENTS BASED ON THP CONSIDERATION OF MARRIAGE CONTEMPLATED AND SUBSEQUENTLY SOLEMNIZED THE CONSIDERATION DOES NOT EXTEND TO STRANGERS IN BLOOD TO THE SETTLER NOR TO HIS COLLATERAL KINDRED BUT AS TO THEM SUCH SETTLEMENT IS WITLR OUT VALUABLE CONSIDERATION AND THEREFORE VOIDABLE AT THE INSTANCE OF THE SETTLERS EXISTING CREDITORS TRIPLETT V ROMINE 33 GRATT AT PP 657659 THERE IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT CHANGE IN THE LAW ON THE SUBJECT MADE AT THE REVISION OF 1887 NOT NOTICED IN THE OPINION OF THE COURT BECAUSE UNNECESSARY TO WHICH IT MAY BE AS WELL TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE PROFESSION UNDER THE CODE OF 1849 CH 149 SEC 13 A SUIT TO SET ASIDE A CONVEYANCE ON THE SOLE GROUND THAT IT WAS VOLUNTARY MUST HAVE BEEN BROUGHT WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE CONVEY ANCE AND IN CONSTRUING THIS SECTION THE COURT IN BICKLE V CHRISMON 76 VA 678 HELD THAT THE FIVE YEARS SHOULD BE COMPUTED FROM SUCH DATE ALTHOUGH THE CREDITORS RIGHT OF ACTION ON HIS CLAIM DID NOT ACCRUE UNTIL AFTER THE FIVE YEARS HAD EXPIRED THIS DECISION WAS BASED ON THE PLAIN LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE FROM WHICH THE COURT DID NOT FEEL ITSELF WARRANTED IN DEPARTING IN SEEKING THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT 596 DEC 1895 STROUTHER V COMMONWEALTH 597 IT WAS HARD TO BE COMPELLED TO SAY THAT A CREDITOR SHOULD BE BARRED BY LAPSE OF TIME OF ALL REMEDY TO ENFORCE HIS CLAIM WHEN DURING THAT TIME THE LAW GAVE HIM NO REMEDY TO ENFORCE IT HENCE BY SECTION 2929 OF THE CODE IT IS PRO VIDED THAT A SUIT TO AVOID A VOLUNTARY CONVEYANCE SHALL BE COMMENCED NOT WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE CONVEYANCE AS BEFORE BUT WITHIN FIVE YEARS FROM THE TIME  THE RIGHT TO AVOID THE SAME HAS ACCRUED THE RIGHT TO AVOID  THE CON VEYANCE WOULD NOT ACCRUE UNTIL THE RIGHT OF ACTIONTHE RIGHT TO RECOVER ON THE CLAIMACCRUED THIS WOULD SEEM TO HAVE REMEDIED THE HARDSHIP OF THE FORMER LAW SUCH WAS THE INTENTION BUT BY THE ACT OF MARCH 2 1894 ACTS 189394 CH 566 PP 614 615 AMENDING AND REENACTING SECTION 2460 OF THE CODE A CREDITOR BEFORE OBTAINING A JUDGMENT OR DECREE FOR HIS CLAIM MAY WHETHER SUCH CLAIM BE DUE AND PAYABLE OR NOT INSTITUTE SUIT TO AVOID THE GIFT CONVEYANCE ETC THE WORDS ITALICIZED MAKE THE CHANGE SO THAT UNDER THE LAW AS IT NOW STANDS INASMUCH AS A CREDITOR MAY INSTITUTE AND PROSECUTE A SUIT TO AVOID A CONVEYANCE AT ANY TIME BEFORE HIS CLAIM HAS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE THE FIVE YEARS PRE SCRIBED BY SECTION 2929 MUST BE COMPUTED FROM THE TIME HIS RIGHT ACCRUED TO AVOID THE CONVEYANCE UNDER SECTION 2460 AS AMENDED BY THE ACT OF 1894 THOUGH HIS CLAIM BE NOT DUE AND PAYABLE

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107533,ON THE FORMATION OF FAT IN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE AND ON THE USE OF THE YELK IN THE FORMATION OF THE EMBRYO IN THE EGG,I206971,L O301 XX ON THE FORMATION OFFAT IN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE AND ON THE USE OF THE YELK IN THE FORMATION OF THE EMBRYO IN THE EGG BY SIR EVERARD H5OME BART V P R S READ MAY 23 XI86 T1HE TADPOLES IN ENGLAND ARE SO SMALL THAT NO PERSON HAS ATTEMPTED TO MAKE AN ACCURATE INVESTIGATION OF THE INTERNAL CHANGES OF STRUCTURE THAT TAKE PLACE IN THEM BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE ANIMAL LEAVING THE EGG AND BECOMING A FROG THE RANA PARADOXA OF SURINAM IN ITS TADPOLE STATE IS LARGER THAN IN ANY OTHER SPECIES OF FROG YET KNOWN AND SO CLOSELY RESEMBLES FISHES THAT IN THAT COUNTRY IT IS SOLD AS SUCH IN THE MARKET FOR THE USE OF THE TABLE UNDER THE NAME OF JACKIE AND AS THE FROG PRODUCED FROM IT IS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AS LARGE AS A COMMON FROG IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT IT BECOMES AN ANIMAL OF CONSIDERABLE SIZE MR IRELAND A SURGEON IN THE ARMY WHO RESIDED SEVERAL YEARS AT SURINAM AND WATCHED THE TADPOLE THROUGH MANY OF ITS CHANGES HAS BROUGHT HOME SPECIMENS IN DIFFERENT STAGES OF ITS METAMOR PHOSIS THESE HE HAS KINDLY SUBMITTED TO MY EXAMINATION AND HAS IN THE MOST LIBERAL MANNER DEPOSITED THE SPECIMENS IN THE MUSEUM OF THE ROYAL COLLEGE OF SURGEONS IN LONDON OF WHICH HE IS A MEMBER AS MR IRELAND HAD NO OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING THE TAD POLE BEFORE THE HIND LEGS BEGIN TO MAKE THEIR APPEARANCE THROUGH THE SKIN WITH A VIEW TO RENDER THE SERIES COMPLETE I HAVE SINCE EXAMINED THE PROGRESS OF THE CHANGES FROM THEO0 SIR EVERARD HOME ON THE FORNMATION OFFAT OVUM IN THE SPAWN OF THE ENGLISH FROG THE JELLY OF WHICH THE OVA ARE COMPOSED I HAVE UPON A FORMER OCCASION GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF TO THE SOCIETY THE OVA THEMSELVES DIFFER FROM THOSE OF SNAKES AND LACERTAE IN GENERAL IN HLAVING NO YELKS WHEN THE TADPOLE IS ONCE FORMED IT APPEARS TO FEED UPON THE JELLY WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY ALBUMEN IS A NEAR APPROACH TO IT IN THIS STAGE EACH OVUM IS PRESSED INTO THE FORM OF AN HEXAGONAL PRISM WITH FLATTENED ENDS SO AS TO FORM THE WHOLE INTO ONE COMPACT MASS THE TADPOLE AFTER IT LEAVES THE OVUM HAS ON EACH SIDE TEN FILAMENTS PROJECTING FROM THE NECK FOR THE PURPOSE OF AERA TION OF THE BLOOD SUCH FILAMENTS MUST BE CONSIDERED AS TEM PORARY GILLS THE LACERTA OF THIS COUNTRY CALLED THE NEWT OR EFT IN ITS LARVA STATE HAS THE SAME PROJECTING FILAMENTS WHICH DROP OFF WHEN THE GILLS ARE FORMED THEY ARE MORE COMPLEX IN THEIR STRUCTURE AND ONLY THREE IN NUMBER ON EACH SIDE THIS CIR CUMSTANCE SHOWS THAT THE LARVA OF AN EFT IS A SPECIES OF TAD POLE AND THAT THE EFT ITSELF DOES NOT BELONG TO THE TRIBE OF LIZARDS BUT IS A NEARER APPROACH TO THAT OF FROGS IN THE TAD POLE AS SOON AS THE ABDOMEN BEGINS TO ENLARGE THESE EXTER NAL FILAMENTS DISAPPEAR TWENTYFOUR SIMILAR FILAMENTS ARE MET WITH IN THE FOETUS OF THE SHARK WHILE CONTAINED IN THE EGG WHICH DROP OFF BEFORE THE FOETUS ESCAPES FROM THE SHELL THE SPAWN OF THE ENGLISH FROG WAS COLLECTED ON THE TST OF APRIL 18I6 ON THE L5TH THE TADPOLE LEFT THE EGG BUT THE FILAMENTS OR EXTERNAL GILLS WERE NOT VISIBLE ONLY A DEEP NOTCH  THE TADPOLES HAVING BECOME FROGS SINCE THIS PAPER WAS READ I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO COMPLETE THE SERIESIN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE ON EACH SIDE NEARLY SEPARATING THE HEAD FROM THE BODY ON THE GD THE TEN FILAMENTS ON EACH SIDE WERE DISTINCT ON THE 27TH THEY DISAPPEARED IN JUNE THE EXTERNAL ORIFICE ON THE LEFT SIDE FOR THE WATER TO PASS OFF FROM THE GILLS WAS VERY DISTINCT BUT NONE WAS SEEN ON THE RIGHT ON JULY THE 8TH THE HIND LEGS BEGAN TO APPEAR BUT THE TOES WERE NOT SEPARATED ON THE I4TH OF JULY THE HIND LEGS WERE SEEN EXTERNALLY COM PLETELY FORMED AND ON OPENING THE SKIN OF THE CHEST THE FORE LEGS WERE EQUALLY SO BUT THERE WAS NO EXTERNAL PROJECTION BY WHICH THIS COULD BE KNOWN THE LUNGS WERE COM PLETELY FORMED ON REMOVING THE INTESTINE THERE WAS NO FAT DEPOSITED ON THE LOINS ON THE 16TH THE CONTENTS OF THE INTESTINE WERE VOIDED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY ON THE 18TH THE ELBOWS OF THE FORE LEGS PROJECTED UNDER THE EXTERNAL SKIN AND SO MUCH OF THE CONTENTS OF THE INTESTINE HAD BEEN VOIDED AS TO GIVE A TAPER FORM TO THE LOWER PART OF THE BODY ON THE IGTH THE FORE LEGS WERE COMPLETELY DISENGAGED AND APPEARED EXTERNALLY THE MOUTH HAD BECOME WIDE LIKE THAT OF A FROG THE TAIL HAD A NOTCH AT THAT PART WHERE IT AFTER WARDS SEPARATES THE INTESTINE WAS REDUCED IN DIAMETER AND TO THE LENGTH OF THAT OF A FROG AN APPEARANCE OF OIL WAS SEEN ON THE LOINS ON THE 23D THE TAIL HAD DROPPED OFF LEAVING THE PROJECTING ROOT THE ANIMAL HAD LEFT THE WATER AND REMAINED AMONG THE GRASS BEHIND THE INTESTINES UPON THE LOINS WERE SEVERAL SMALL MEMBRANOUS APPENDAGES IN AN EMPTY STATE ON THE 28TH THE ROOT OF THE TAIL HAD WHOLLY DISAPPEARED THE APPENDAGES HAD BECOME MORE OPAQUE THE OVA OF THE FROG APPEAR TO BE HATCHED AT VERY DIFFERENT PERIODS SINCE SOME OF THE TADPOLES BECOME COMPLETE FROGS BEFORE OTHERS HAVE THEIR HIND LEGS PROTRUDED THROUGH THE SKIN UPON EXAMINING THE TADPOLE OF THE RANA PARADOXA JUST 303O04 SIR ERVEARLD HOME ON THE FORMATION OFFAT WHEN THE HIND FEET APPEAR EXTERNALLY I FOUND THE MOUTH VERY SMALL AND NEARLY ROUND THE TEETH CUTICULAR THE UPPER ONES OVERLAPPING THE UNDER THE CESOPHAGUS STOMACH AND INTESTINE FORMING ONE UNIFORMLY CONTINUED CANAL WHICH PASSED DOWN TO THE LOWER PART OF THE ABDOMEN IT WAS BENT UPON ITSELF PASSED UP AGAIN AND THEN MADE A GREAT NUMBER OF COILS IN A CIRCULAR FORM ITS COATS WERE VERY FIRM ITS CAPACITY VERY SMALL THERE WERE THREE GILLS COMPLETELY ENCLOSED ON EACH SIDE AND A LITTLE WAY BELOW THE EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE A SMALL ROUND ORIFICE FOR THE WATER BY WHICH THE GILLS ARE SUPPLIED TO PASS OUT BUT NONE ON THE RIGHT WHEN THE TADPOLE IS ARRIVED AT ITS FULL GROWTH AND THE HIND LEGS ARE COMPLETELY FORMED WHICH TAKES PLACE ACCORDING TO MR IRELANDS OBSERVATIONS IN 14 DAYS AFTER THEIR FIRST APPEARANCE THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN HAD BECOME EXCEEDINGLY ENLARGED THE INTESTINE VERY CAPA CIOUS ITS COATS ALMOST AS THIN AS COBWEB IT WAS COMPLETELY DISTENDED THROUGH ITS WHOLE EXTENT WITH A SOFT SUBSTANCE WHICH WHEN BURNT HAD THE SMELL OF HAY BEHIND THE INTES TINE ALL ALONG THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE ABDOMEN A LARGE QUANTITY OF FAT WAS MET WITH OF A YELLOW COLOUR ENCLOSED IN LONG THIN TRANSPARENT MEMBRANOUS BAGS NO PART OF THIS FAT WAS MET WITH IN THE PRIOR STAGES OF THE TADPOLES GROWTH THE LUNGS WERE COMPLETELY FORMED WHEN THE MOUTH OF THE TADPOLE HAS BEEN CHANGED INTO THAT OF THE FROG AND THE FORE LEGS COMPLETELY PROTRUDED BUT THE TAIL REMAINING ENTIRE WHICH HAPPENS 21 DAYS AFTER THE LAST MEN TIONED CHANGE THE LARGE COILS OF INTESTINE WERE FOUND CON TRACTED INTO A CANAL ONE FOURTH OF ITS ORIGINAL LENGTH THE COATS HAD BECOME AS FIRM AS THOSE OF AN ARTERY THE EXTERNAL SURIACE WAS CORRUGATEDAND THE CANAL EMPTY THE STOMACH HAD BE COME A DISTINCT CAVITY AND THERE WAS A CONTRACTION WHERE ITIN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE 305 TERMINATES IN THE INTESTINE ALL THESE PARTS WERE EMBEDDED IN FAT WHICH FILLED EVERY PART OF THE ABDOMEN NOT OCCUPIED BY THE LIVER WHICH HAD ACQUIRED A LARGE SIZE THE LUNGS WERE FILLED WITH AIR AND THE GILLS HAD ENTIRELY DISAPPEARED WHEN THE TAIL HAS DROPPED OFF LEAVING THE PROJECTING ROOT WHICH TAKES PLACE IN SEVEN DAYS MORE THE ONLY INTERNAL CHANGE MET WITH WAS THAT NO FAT WHATEVER WAS FOUND IN THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN THE GREAT LENGTH OF THE INTESTINE WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED HAS NOTHING ANALOGOUS TO IT IN THE CATERPILLAR AND IS PROBABLY CONFINED TO THE FROG TRIBE THE EGG OF A FROG BEARS NO PROPORTION IN SIZE TO THOSE OF THE OTHER ANIMALS OF THE SAME CLASS AND DIFFERS FROM THEM IN HAVING NO YELK THEREFORE ALTHOUGH IT CONTAINS SUFFICIENT MATE RIALS FOR THE FORMATION OF THE TADPOLE SOMETHING IS STILL WANT ING BEFORE IT CAN BE METAMORPHOSED INTO A FROG AND IN THE TADPOLE STATE A STORE OF FAT IS LAID UP BEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED FOR ITS OWN IMMEDIATE SUPPORT AND FUTURE GROWTH TO FURNISH THE NECESSARY MEANS OF SUPPLYING THE DIFFERENT STRUCTURES IN THE FROG NOT ALREADY EXISTING IN THE TADPOLE AND THIS FAT APPEARS TO BE FORMED IN THE INTESTINE THE LENGTH OF INTESTINE IN THE TADPOLE WHEN ITS RELATIVE PRO PORTION TO THE SIZE OF THE ANIMAL IS CONSIDERED EXCEEDS EVERY THING OF THE KIND THAT IS MET WITH IN OTHER ANIMALS IN THE TADPOLE OF THE SURINAM FROG THE INTESTINE AFTER IT HAS ACQUIRED ITS FULL SIZE DOES NOT REMAIN OF THIS ENORMOUS LENGTH BEYOND THE PERIOD OF ITS METAMORPHOSIS INTO THE FROG TAKING PLACE AND WHAT IS DESERVING OF PARTICULAR ATTENTION THE FAT IS DEPOSITED WHEN THE INTESTINE HAS ACQUIRED ITS FULL SIZE AND NO SOONER IS THE IODTESTINE REDUCED IN LENGTH THAN NOT ONLY NO0O6 SIR EVERARD HOME ON THEFORMATION OF FAT MORE FAT IS DEPOSITED BUT ALL THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FORMED IS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN CONSUMED IN PRODUCING THE METAMOR PHOSIS INTO THE FROG WHICH LEADS ME TO CONCLUDE THAT SUCH A DEPOSIT OF FAT IS NECESSARY TO THE METAMORPHOSIS OF A TAD POLE INTO A FROG AND THAT SUCH UNUSUAL LENGTH OF INTESTINE IS REQUIRED TO ADMIT OF SO LARGE A QUANTITY OF FAT BEING FORMED IN SO SHORT A TIME AND THEREFORE THAT THE INTESTINE IS THE LABORATORY IN WHICH THE FAT IS FORMED TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE NECESSITY OF SUCH A SUPPLY OF FAT IS OCCASIONED BY THE SOFT PARTS OF THE TADPOLE NOT BEING CON VERTIBLE INTO BONES AND OTHER PARTS OF THE FROG WHICH DID NOT EXIST IN THE TADPOLE OR SIMPLY FROM A DEFICIENCY OF MATERIALS I HAVE HAD THE ASSISTANCE OF MY FRIEND AND FELLOW LABOURER IN ANIMAL CHEMISTRY MR HATCHETT WHO SOME YEARS AGO ASCER TAINED THAT THE YELK OF AN EGG IS ESSENTIALLY COMPOSED OF CONCRETE OIL COMBINED WITH A SMALL PROPORTION OF ALBUMEN AND HE HAS MADE OUT THE FOLLOWING IMPORTANT FACTS THAT THE SPAWN OF THE FROG HAS NO YELK AND CONTAINS NO OIL WHAT EVER HE ALSO CORROBORATES MR BRANDES STATEMENT THAT IT CONSISTS OF A SUBSTANCE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN ALBUMEN AND GELATINE INCLINING PRINCIPALLY TO THE FORMER THAT THE OVA OF THE SHELL SNAIL BOTH OF THOSE THAT HAVE A SHELL AND THOSE THAT HAVE ONLY A STRONG MEMBRANOUS COVERING HAVE NO YELKS AND CONSIST OF ALBUMEN SINCE THEY COAGULATE IN PROOF SPIRIT OF WINE AND WHEN SO COAGULATED AND EXAMINED SOME TIME AFTERWARDS APPEAR NOT TO CONTAIN ANY OIL THAT THE OVA OF THE LOBSTER HAVE NO YELK AND CONTAIN NO OIL BUT HE REMARKS THAT THE SPAWN OF THE LOBSTER WHEN RECENT IS FILLED WITH ALBUMEN MINGLED WITH A SUBSTANCE OF A DARK OLIVE COLOUR AND WHILST THE FORMER AS USUAL IS COAGULATED BY HEATIN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE 307 THE LATTER BECOMES OF A VIVID RED THIS MR HATCHETT OBSERVES IS THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE SHELL WHICH THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO MR BRANDE FOUND TO BECOME RED BY THE APPLICATION OF ACIDS WITHOUT HEAT FOR DILUTE SULPHURIC NITRIC MURIATIC AND THE STRONG ACETIC ACIDS IMMEDIATELY PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT ON THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE SPAWN BUT THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHEN A WEAK ACID SUCH AS COMMON DISTILLED VINEGAR IS EM PLOYED WHEN THIS BRIGHT RED COLOUR HAS BEEN PRODUCED BY THE ABOVE ACIDS IT APPEARS TO BE PERMANENT EXCEPTING WHEN NITRIC ACID HAS BEEN USED FOR THEN THE RED COLOUR CHANGES TO YELLOW WHICH BY THE AFFUSION OF AMMONIA BECOMES ORANGE COLOUR AS IS USUAL WITH ANIMAL SUBSTANCES SO TREATED DILUTE NITRIC ACID IN WHICH IT HAD BEEN DIGESTED AFFBRDED SLIGHT TRACES OF A PHOSPHATE WHICH WAS NOT PHOSPHATE OF LIME AS THERED COLOUR IS PRODUCED BY ACIDS AS WELL AS BY HEAT THERE WAS SOME REASON TO EXPECT THAT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN DE STROYED OR AT LEAST THAT ITS INTENSITY WOULD HAVE BEEN DIMI NISHED BY A GREAT EXCESS OF THE ALKALIES BUT NOT THE SMALLEST EFFECT WAS PRODUCED BY ANY OF THESE AND INDEED SO FAR FROM IT THAT THE RECENT SPAWN WHEN PUT INTO A SOLUTION OF CAUSTIC POTASH BECAME IN A FEW SECONDS CHANGED TO AS BRIGHT A RED AS WHEN THE MINERAL ACIDS HAD BEEN EMPLOYED THE RED COLOUR IS ALSO PRODUCED BY THE EFFECTS OF AIR LIGHT AND THE EVAPORATION OF MOISTURE FOR PAPER OR LINEN WHICH HAVE BEEN STAINED WITIH THE OLIVE COLOURED SUBSTANCE BECOME RED IN THE COURSE OF A FEW MINUTES SO THAT IN THIS RESPECT IT SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES THE SECRETION OBTAINED FROM THE BUCCI NUM LAPILLUS OR PURPLE WHELK THE PURPLE COLOUR OF THIS LAST DOES NOT HOWEVER SUFFER ANY CHANGE WHILST THE COLOURING MDCCCXVI S SSIR EVERARD HOME ON THE FORMATION OF FAT MATTER OF THE LOBSTER IN THE COURSE OF SOME DAYS BECOMES OF AN OCHRACEOUS COLOUR IN THIS STATE IT SEEMS TO BE PERMANENT FOR IT WAS RETAINED BY LINEN WHICH HAD BEEN MARKED WITH IT AFTER REPEATED BOILING IN WATER AND WASHING WITH SOAP FROM THESE CURSORY EXPERIMENTS MR HATCHETT OBSERVES THAT THIS ANIMAL COLOURING SUBSTANCE IS APPARENTLY OF A PECU LIAR NATURE AND THAT IT IS THE SAME IN THE COMMON CRAY FISH AND THE PRAWN AS WELL AS IN THE SEA CRAY FISH AND THE CRAB BUT IN THE TWO LAST IT HAS ALREADY ASSUMED ITS RED COLOUR THAT THE OVA OF THE SALMON AND PIKE HAVE NO YELK AND CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF ALBUMEN AS THEY COAGULATE BY HEAT BUT CONTAIN ALSO A SMALL PORTION OF OIL WHICH PERHAPS IS A SUB STITUTE FOR YELK THAT THE OVA OF THE CARTILAGINOUS FISHES AS WELL AS THOSE OF THE LIZARD AND SNAKE HAVE A REGULARLY FORMED YELK LIKE THAT OF THE HEN COMPOSED OF THE SAME INGREDIENTS BUT IN BOTH THE VIVIPAROUS AND OVIPAROUS SHARKS THERE IS NO PERFECTLY FORMED ALBUMEN BUT IN ITS PLACE A GELATINOUS SUBSTANCE WHICH MR BRANDE ASCERTAINED TO BE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN GELATIN AND ALBUMEN SIMILAR TO WHAT IS MET WITH IN THE SPAWN OF THE FROG IN ADDITION TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN ABOVE STATED MR HAT CHETT HAS COMMUNICATED TO ME THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS THE YELK OF THE EGGS OF BIRDS IS PRINCIPALLY AND ESSEN TIALLY COMPOSED OF A BUTYRACEOUS OIL COMBINED WITH A SMALL PROPORTION OF ALBUMEN THE AVERAGE OF WHICH IN THE YELK OF THE COMMON FOWL AMOUNTS TO ABOUT ONE FIFTH YELK WHEN TRI TURATED AND DILUTED WITH WATER FORMS AS IS WELL KNOWN AN EMULSION AND YELK MAY BE REGARDED AS AN EMULSION IN A HIGH STATE OF CONCENTRATION 3O8IN THE INTESTINE OF THE TADPOLE 809 IN MILK THE CASEOUS PART OR CURD CORRESPONDS TO THE ALBU MINOUS PART OF YELK AS THE BUTTER IN MILK DOES TO THE OTHER PART OR OIL OF THE YELK THE PRINCIPAL DIFFERENCE THEREFORE BETWEEN MILK AND YELK IS THAT THE FORMER IS IN A DILUTE AND THE LATTER IN A CONCENTRATED STATE HENCE MR HATCHETT OB SERVES IT APPEARS THAT MANY OF THE OVIPAROUS ANIMALS DUR ING THE PERIOD OF INCUBATION ARE NOURISHED BY A PABULUM SIMI LAR IN QUALITY TO THAT BY WHICH YOUNG VIVIPAROUS ANIMALS ARE SUPPORTED WHILST THE GREAT DEGREE OF CONCENTRATION OF THIS PABULUM IN THE FIRST CASE IS ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY IN ORDER THAT THE QUANTITY OF NUTRITIOUS MATTER WHICH IS REQUIRED DURNG INCUBATION AND WHICH IS INCLUDED WITH THE ANIMAL WITHIN THE EGG SHOULD BE CONDENSED INTO THE SMALLEST POSSIBLE BULK YOUNG VIVIPAROUS ANIMALS ARE AT FIRST INCAPABLE OF SUPPORT ING THEMSELVES BY THOSE SUBSTANCES WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS TO BECOME THEIR FOOD AND THEY ARE THEREFORE NOURISHED FOR A CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME BY THE MILK OF THEIR MOTHERS BUT YOUNG OVIPAROUS ANIMALS SUCH AS THE CHICKEN PARTRIDGE AND BIRDS IN GENERAL COME FORTH FROM THE SHELLS COMPLETE IN THEIR BODILY FACULTIES AND IMMEDIATELY PARTAKE OF THE FOOD TO WHICH THE PARENT BIRDS ARE ACCUSTOMED SO THAT IT SEEMS THEY ARE PRE PARED FOR THIS AND ARE NOURISHED DURING INCUBATION BY A SUB STANCE SIMILAR IN ITS NATURE TO THAT BY WHICH YOUNG VIVIPAROUS ANIMALS ARE SUPPORTED OR SUCKLED DURING A CERTAIN TIME AFTER THEIR BIRTH AND THAT THE PROCESS CORRESPONDING TO THAT OF SUCK LING IS WITH REGARD TO BIRDS PERFORMED AND COMPLETED IN THE COURSE OF INCUBATION THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH MR HATCHETT HAS MADE UPON THE OVA OF THESE DIFFERENT TRIBES OF ANIMALS LEAD TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IN ALL OVA THE EMBRYOS OF WHICH HAVE BONES THERE IS A SS1IO SIR EVERARD HOME O0 THEFORMATION OJFFAT C CERTAIN PORTION OF OIL AND IN THOSE OVA WHOSE EMBRYOS CON SIST ENTIRELY OF SOFT PARTS THERE IS NONE THIS CONCLUSION IS MUCH STRENGTHENED BY THE PECULIARITY WHICH IT HAS BEEN MY OBJECT IN THIS PAPER TO POINT OUT OF THE TADPOLE LAYING UP A MAGAZINE OF FAT BEFORE THE METAMOR PHOSIS INTO A FROG TAKES PLACE IT IS THEREFORE RENDERED PROBABLE THAT A CERTAIN PORTION OF OIL IS NECESSARY FOR THE FORMATION OF BONE AND THAT THE PROPORTION IN DIFFERENT OVA CORRESPONDS WITH THE GREATER OR LESS DEGREE OF HARDNESS OF THIE BONES OF THE FOTUS

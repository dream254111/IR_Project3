wealth prosperity happiness and greatness THE PANAMA EXPOSITION PRESIDENT CHARLES C MOORE of the Pan amaPacific International Exposition to open in San Francisco on February 20 1915 has issued the following statement Qne month ago the decision of the PannamaPa cific International Exposition management not to postpone was first published The development of events since then in their relation to the exposi tion all tend to confirm the wisdom of that orig inal decision At the time the decision was made no word had been received from any foreign nation as to the effect on its plans caused by the European war but it was hoped that at least those nations not fighting would go on with their plans Later de velopments have proven that hope well founded in addition we have definite assurances from France from Italy from Turkey and from Japan that their intentions are unchanged Holland has added 300000 to her original appropriation Italy has ordered work on her building and ex hibits rushed Japan has asked for and received an increase of space The Argentine Republic has increased its appropriation from 1250000 to 1750000 We shall undoubtedly lose some of the promised exhibits from Europe but not by any means all of them and not by any means the most important of them Both Germany and Great Britain will be represented by individual exhibitors or by associa tions thereof We shall undoubtedly lose some of the promised entries by European champions in the athletic events but the international character of those events will not be lost We may lose some of the art treasures promised us for the Fine Arts Building but we shall gain others because of the war Of compensating gains we have many There is a very sharp demand for space from the manufac tures of this country of South America and of the European nations not at war The Exposition suddenly becomes an important factor in an extra ordinary economic situation It is seen to be the one great easy efficient way by which American made goods can be brought to the direct attention of the distributors and consumers of South Amer ica and the Orient The latter are coming here in force in 1915 to make new individual gn4 com mercial cqnnections forced by the war As regards attendance every transportation ex pert confirms the opinion that a continued Euro pean war is likely rather to increase travel to Cali fornia in 1915 than to reduce it The Exposition is 92 per cent ready today It will open February 20 as plannedand it will be as planned the most beautiful and most interest ing exposition ever seen There is no reason to believe that the success of the exposition in any phase will be any less than that which was so cer tain before the European war broke out and it is certain to be even more important commercially than was ever dreamed THE FRANKLIN MEDAL SAMUEL INSULL ESQ of Chicago Illinois writing under date of December 23 1913 to the board of managers of the Franklin Insti tute Philadelphia stated that he had been informed it would be a source of gratification to them if the institute had available in addi tion to such medals already in its gift a medal to be known as the Franklin Medal and to be awarded from time to time in recognition of the total contributions of individuals to sci ence or to the applications of physical science to industry rather than in recognition of any single invention or discovery however impor tant He agreed to provide for the founding of this medal under the following general con ditions 1 That an amount not exceeding one thou sand dollars should be furnished by him for procuring appropriate designs and dies for the medal and diploma 2 That the medal should possess distinct artistic merit and have on one side a medal lion of Benjamin Franklin done from the Thomas Sully portrait in the possession of the institute 3 That the medal should be of gold and have an intrinsic value of about seventyfive dollars 4 That the sum of five thousand dollars should be provided by him to be held in trust in perpetuity to be a foundation for this medal and to be known as the Franklin Medal Fund founded January 1 1914 by Samuel Insull Esq 477N S VoL XL No 1031 5 That the interest of this fund should be used from time to time in awarding the Frank lin medal to those workers in physical science or technology without regard to country whose efforts have in the judgment of the institute done most to advance a knowledge of physical science or its applications 6 That any excess of income from this fund beyond such average annual sum as might be deemed necessary by the institute for the number of medals it is considered best to award might be used for premiums to accom pany the medals Mr Insull said he understood that the insti tute would be glad to award on the average two Franklin medals a year Though this would leave little surplus he inserted the sixth condition to prevent an undesirable accumula tion of the fund At the stated meeting of the board of man agers February 11 1914 the above offer was accepted and the medal has been designed by Dr R Tait McKenzie of the University of Pennsylvania SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS AMONG the

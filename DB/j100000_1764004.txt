virtue of the furnace heat is dry and warm a man the soles of whose shoes are thoroughly dry and electrification will probably result from every brisk movement of the man over the carpet These condi tions are most likely to be met with during cold win ter weather and it is then that the phenomena are generally noticed It is not probable that Dr Shu feldts two friends can perform the feat of lighting gas in this way at all times and under all circum stances His statement that the  electrical discharge was considerably greater from the tip of the index finger than from any of the others of the hand and gradually diminished in regular order as we pro ceeded to the little finger is interesting but needs confirmation I am sceptical as to the charging of his entire system  withthis animal electricity and the results which followed such a condition and particu larly so as to the origin of the  sense of the most pro found relief as if it were that all the electricity of my system had been completely withdrawn by the act which he experienced when his hand touched the back of the young mulatto girl Is man one of the extremely small number of animals having spe cialized electrical organs T C M Terre Haute Ind Feb 22 Inertiaforce The importance of clear elementary ideas on the teaching of dynamics justifies me I think in asking space for a further discussion of Dr E H Halls  inertiaforce In his letter published in Science of Feb 18 Dr Hall expresses the opinion that our difference with regard to inertiaforce is based upon a difference of interpretation of theterm  force That I think is not the case With all his statements as to force in general I agree and the passage which he quotes from Maxwell as expressing his view of force with sufficient accuracy expresses also my viewwith com plete accuracy Dr Hall indeed says that this pas sage meets many of the points raised by me and it would thus seem that it must be inconsistent with many of my positions But I am unable to detect the inconsistency and Dr Hall merely asserts it without giving any proof I am in full agreement also with Dr Hall not in opposition to him as he supposes when passing from force in general to a particular case he says that a ball swinging in a circle at the end of a string acts upon the string with a force directed from the centre The ball certainly does exert such a force I think it misleading to call that force centrifugal force as he and many writers do but that the force which he calls centrifugal force is an actual force is undoubted But when Dr Hall proceeds to expound his inertia force we seem to part company perhaps because he has not given a complete specification of this force He has told us its magnitude and its direction but its place of application the body on which it acts he has left us to infer from the context and my infer ence he calls in question It would be useless for me to justify my inference because in Dr Halls letter he modifies the statement of the pamphlet from which it was drawn saying that what he meant was that  the inertiaforce works or acts with the fCE LVOL iX No 213 smaller applied force against the agent which exerts the greater force From this modified statement I could not of course have made the inference re ferred to in fact I could have made no inference at all for it is couched in language which is not the current language of dynamics which is not defined and which I must confess I do not understand Let us however take Dr Halls new illustration and see what light that throws on the place of appli cation of inertiaforce  A train is being started by a locomotive The forces applied to the train are the pull of the locomotive and the smaller opposing force of friction The pull of the locomotive pre vails but in prevailing it must deal not only with the resistance due to friction but with the reaction which also I call resistance due to the inertia of the train in other words the inertiaforce Here again Dr Hall uses terms not current in dynamics and I do not understand what he means by the loco motive  dealing with  both the frictional resistance and the inertiaforce Whatever may be the exact meaning of that phrase however it seems clear that if the inertiaforce acts on the train and if the pull of the locomotive has to deal with this force in mov ing the train it must he expected to have some effect on the motion of the train Yet if F is the pull of the locomotive R the frictional resistance M the mass of the train and a its acceleration we have undoubtedly by Newtons second law of motion a  F R M and hence the inertiaforce is quite without effect on the motion of the train It would seem thereiore that the inertiaforce cannot act on the train Does it then act on the locomotive If so it can only be the force which the train exerts on the locomotive which is of course equal and opposite to the above force F But it cannot be this force for if the brakes be put on the train though the pull of the locomotive on the train and therefore the force exerted by the train on the locomotive  may be kept constant the acceleration of the train will change and according to Dr Hall the inertiaforce must be proportional to this acceleration Thus even this new illustration does not enable us to determine on what body the inertiaforce acts This difficulty in determining the place of applica tion of the inertiaforce would be at once accounted for if it should be found to have no place of appli cation at all and I strongly suspect this to be the true conclusion Dr Hall seems to me in fact to have postulated a hypothetical force to account for the supposed resistance of a body to the action of an applied force and to have thus fallen into the error referred to by Poisson in the following sentences   Concevons quun corps soit pose sur un plan horizontal et quil ny soit retenu par aucun grotte ment Si je veux le faire glisser sur ce plan il faudra neanmoins a cause de

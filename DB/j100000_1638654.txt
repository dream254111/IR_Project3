kind and gen erous friend to the young men and particularly solicitous for their advancement These were the qualities which made Dr Dudley so successful as president of the American Chemical Society In that high office his kindly diplomacy and great tact en abled him to harmonize many conflicting in terests and to so largely help to advance the interests of the society and bring it to that ex cellent condition of harmony and efficiency which now prevails This book will be a valuable addition to all libraries and particularly to those of the younger generation It should be read and pondered by all men WILLIAM MCMURTRIE Taschenbuch fiir Mathematilcer und Physiker By FELIX AUERBACH and RUDOLF ROTHA Leipzig B G Teubner 2 Jahrgang 1911 The second volume of the  Taschenbuch consisting of 580 pages may not correspond to the American idea of a  Taschenbuch but it is an unusually convenient  Hand buch for mathematicians and physicists A part of the table of contents is of value only or chiefly to residents of Germanythe cal ender for Berlin the table of magnetic ele ments for central Europe the Verzeichnis der Hochschullehrer but with these ex ceptions the entire book is of general interest The articles dealing with astronomical facts concerning planets and comets the tables of astronomical and geodetic constants the fourplace logarithm tables of numbers and trigonometric functions the tables of squares and Bessel functions the numerous tables of all the important physical constants call for no review One notes however how admir able is the synopsis of the fundamental defi nition and operations of mathematics A candidate for a doctors degree in physics would do well to master the mathematical portion of this volume Not only is here given the theoretical groundwork of the sub ject there are also given laborsaving appli cations e g the complete Fouriers series are worked out for a number of common forms of the function There is also an appli cation to lifeinsurance mathematics The synopsis of the fundamental principles of physics while lacking the continuity of the mathematical synopsis is none the less com plete There is here condensed what one ordinarily finds spread over several volumes of general physics The article which will be of the greatest interest to readers of the Taschenbuch  is that on the principle of relativity by Willy Wien It is an historical and a critical sum mary complete at least in its physical aspect The contributions to this theory made by Minkowski are briefly set forth not only in this article but also in the review of Minkow skis work with which the book opens That one who has contributed so much to this far reaching theory should be cut off in the very prime of his power is to be greatly deplored Physicists and mathematicians will be pleased to have the portrait of Minkowski which ac companies the article G F HULL SPECIAL ARTICLES CONCERNING A NEW ARRANGEMENT OF THE ELE MENTS ON A HELIX AND THE RELATION SHIPS WHICH MAY BE USEFULLY EXPRESSED THEREON IN this abstract of a paper which under the title Helix Chemica has been published in The American Chemical Journal Vol XLV p 160 1911 the writer wishes to explain briefly the grounds of the proposed arrange ment and to illustrate by a few examples the many uses to which the helix may be put to bring out and compare the complex relation ships of the elements In Fig I the helix is presented from the side in Fig 2 from the end where of course the front curve of each series hides those be hind it In Figs 36 the curves are drawn as if they were on the end of a barrel enabling one to see the groups and series at the same time A great number of harmonic relations are presented on these figures only a few of which can be discussed in this abstract The system uses the series of Mendeleeff but makes one half of each group the antithesis 640 SCIENCENOVEMBR 10 1911 instead of the associate of the other thus separating dissimilar elements like copper and potassium The elements are placed in the order of their atomic weights and with interspaces equal to the average difference of the atomic weights of adjacent elements These differences are found to increase for the different groups of rings in the simplest arithmetical ratio 0 1 2 3 4 where since the atomic weights are rarely whole numbers the ratio numbers will not be exact digits and the first term will be some very small number instead of exactly zero The regularly recurring resem blances of the elements break them up into groups determining the number of circles of a given size and the number of interspaces and of elements upon each kind of circle and all these relations are according to the same simplest geometrical ratio 2 4 8 16 32 The length of each circle is obtained by combining these ratios Starting with the best determined circles the lithium ring covers a range of atomic weights equal to sixteen HNe16 and contains eight elements an octant and so the average interspace is put as two The sodium series is wholly symmetrical with the Li ring and so is put on a second equal coil of a spiral beside it The third ring agrees exactly with the other two from potassium to titanium potassium having valence and sp gr about like sodium and so on to titanium which has valence and sp gr about 4 like silicon Here the resemblance ceases and vanadium instead of agreeing with phosphorus con tinues downward with valence and sp gr 5 and so on to the iron triad group with valence and sp gr equal to 8 and then the curve turns valence and sp gr grow less copper  7 zinc 6 etc until the last half of this band from Ge to Br is exactly homologous with the rearward half in Fig 1 of the preceding circles Thus is established a sec ond larger type of circle containing sixteen elements a double octant and making an advance in atomic weight of about 48 so that the interweight becomes about 3 and the inter space in this circle is made 3 This changes the spiral into a helix Four such circles can be constructed If there are two octant circles with an interspace of 2 and four double octants with interspace 3 there should be 8 quadruple octants with interspace 4 but the curve advances only one quadrant of the first circle of this type and does this with an inter space of 4 but becomes so complex that it falls asunder spontaneously giving up atoms of helium whose combining weight is 4 indica ting that the additions in this last curve have been by fours In the other direction symmetry demands a diminishing of the helix to a single half octant with interspace 1 and hydrogen stands at the beginning and helium 4 at the end of this ring One must search among the nebulhe for elements light enough to fill the two gaps and we find among the simpler spectra in the simplest nebule the lines 4340 tm and 4862 tm belonging to hydrogen the next higher line 4959 tm belonging to nebulium which has probably greater density than hy drogen because it is found more concentrated in the center of the nebulae for which reasons we may assume nebulium to be a dyad and to take the second place in our circle The next higher line 5007 tm I have tentatively as signed to the next element in this halfoctant which from its position must be a halogen and which I have called protofluorine The next higher number 5876 tm belongs to heliumwhich completes the circle The helix must close with the half of a quarteroctanta single element which must have valence 0 a density much less than hydrogen and atomic weight much less than unity Where would one search for such an element better than in the corona Indeed coronium is found to be probably lighter than hydrogen since its lines are found further from the sun than those of hydrogen It occu pies also the position of the second element extrapolated by Mendeleeff for which he ob tained the atomic weight 04 and suggested its identity with coronium I have by a sim ilar method obtained the value 03 and the symmetry of the helix would suggest that it should be still smaller SCIENCE 641N S VOL XXXIV No 880 There remains only the origin of the curve where I have placed the letter E for the ether electron protyle or Urstoff which must have a valence and density equal to zero1 and we may also almost say with an atomic weight of zero since E is the x of Mendeleeff for which he calculated a hypothetical atomic weight equal to onemillionth that of the hydrogen atom The numerical relations of the helix are summarized in the following table The positions and the number of the elements on the different circles may be ob tained by drawing a regularly increasing number of diameters to each succeeding type or circle One vertical diameter is drawn in the quarteroctant giving place at its ends for two elements Two diameters are drawn at right angles in the halfoctant for four elements The angles are bisected by two other diameters giving place for eight ele ments in the octants and then again bisected giving sixteen for the double and a final bi TABLE OF THE SYMMETRIES OF THE HELIX 1 Length of inter space   inter weights in each type of circle Approximate

geometri cal ratio Combina tion of above section gives thirtytwo for the quadruple oc tants The helix is placed horizontally so that the nullivalent elements shall form its axisthey being the lightest elementsfrom which each group is continued downward with sym metrical increase in valence and density on either side to a maximum in the triads at the bottom The alkalis on the one side are the antitheses of the halogens on the other and this maximum of dissimilarity decreases downward symmetrically on either side In the double octants it reaches a valence of 8 and a corresponding specific gravity In the octants the circle closes with a valence of 4 It is interesting that carbon the element of life and silicon the element of the rocks form the center of the figure and are both tri morphic like the triads at the bottom of the double octants If the helix be cut along its axis and the curves opened out on a flat sur face the table of the elements given below re sults This shows that the newcomers inter calated between the homologues of the pre ceding group are three for the octave nine for the doubleoctave and seventeen for the quadruple octave if there be a triad at the bottom of the large curve Symmetry would demand a group of twelve at that place If the helix be cut along the lower line of densest elements and flattened out we have the following table where as the lowest ele ments have an equal right to be placed at either side they are placed on both sides This suggests the possibility that the second element beyond uranium would be the first member of a triad Doubtless a better suggestion would come from the preceding table that there would be a triad or larger group at the bottom of the larger circle I Longitudinal Relations Fig 1 At the bottom of Fig 1

thus empha sizing the more important part of the atomic volume graph the compressibility graph of T W Richards changed to apply only to solids and the graph of the fusion of the halogen compounds of Thomas Carnelley These graphs are changed in size only to match the helix and the exact agreement of the four large curves with the double octaves the two small ones with the octaves and the exact space left for the half octave is a strong confirmation of the naturalness of the helix Further I have been able by a very reasonable extrapolation to prolong backward the atomic volume graph to match exactly the half and quarter octaves and to show that its natural E culminations are in the inert gases and not in the alkalis The law of longitudinal condensation is especially interesting It is only in the middle or K circle the one containing po tassium and iron that density and valence agree from 1 in K to 8 in Fe so that density divided by valence DV equals unity In earlier circles DV is less than 1 so that less matter is condensed into the atom that satis fies a given amount of H and in later cir cles DV is greater than unity and more matter is condensed into the corresponding atom Thus

values given above are extrapolated in accordance with Goldschmidts law Instead of omitting any elements as sug gested above a different and perhaps more useful line of thought may be followed It may be assumed that the true relations would appear only when the specific gravities were taken under common conditions say at 273 since the elements expand unequally and sometimes diversely with change of temperature so that we can obtain only ap proximate results from specific gravities taken at ordinary temperatures We find the law most perfectly realized at the bottom of each circle at the point of greatest condensa tion Thus C as graphite is 5 Si as quartz isNOVEMBER 10 1911 SCIENCE 3 1  2 3 oS Comi 3  i   2  3 Law o 2I  2 IMbraI in size only to match the diagram It will be seen that the

osmium is 28  instead of 3 Moreover all the elements in the lower part of each curve keep close to this average but as we pass up the left side of the curves into the region of lessened density we come upon a sudden sharp divergence from the law in the sulphur and halogen series caused by the polymerization or allotropic states of these ele ments If we divide the numbers of the sul phur and the first half of the halogen series by two and bromium and iodine by three we obtain numbers closely coinciding with the law in every case thus Fl C1 Br I S Se Te Obtained by division 55 65 1 17 5 11 15

different and much steeper lines and drop to the com mon band when divided as suggested above The transverse relations may be diametral or symmetrical to a vertical diameter Fig 3 equatorial or symmetrical to a horizontal diameter Fig 4 and ecliptic or symmetrical to an oblique diameter Fig 5 II Diametral Relations Fig 3 A vertical diameter representing a vertical plane bisecting the helix divides the elements into two groups which are for many relations the counterparts of each other some exactly and some approximately Each of these rela tions is placed on a separate ringan arrow indicating the direction of increase and a cross the points of change It is curious that some of these relations are symmetrical to a line a little to the right of the diameter and passing between C and Si and others to a line passing to the left of the diameter and to the right of C and Si The only complex relations are those of the Mendeleeff series and the magnetic relations which would seem more simple if the two octants were drawn as a single double octant The most inexplicable of all these relations is expressed in the outer circle As we pass down the righthand curves an addition of 1 2 3 and 4 units  H atoms successively produces the same unit increase in valence and density and thus there is great condensation going up on the left with the same increasing addition and thus with still increasing mass there is lessening valence and density and this contrast is repeated seven times III Equatorial Relations Fig 4 The horizontal diameter makes very simple relationships most of which are combined with the diametral relations in quadrantal arrange ment The valence may be a simple dia metral relation or may increase to 4 and then decrease as an equatorial relation The elec tropotential relations are equatorial in so far as they are all strong above the horizontal line and weak below quadrantal as far as thle sign is concerned IV The Ecliptic Relations Fig 5 The most important ecliptic relation is fusi bility On the one side are the high fusing elements reaching a maximum fusing point at the end of an axis at right angles to the ecliptic On the other side are the low fusing or volatile elements reaching the maximum volatility at the end of the vertical axis At one end of the ecliptic is the liquid mercury and at the other the luminous radium while all the elements of the central most volatile quadrant cut out of the volitile semicircle by the equator and meridian are absent from the sun except these at the center oxygen and nitrogen the elements of the air Relations of Partial and Complex Sym metry Fig 6 The gas and rock areas show an antithesis which is only approximately an ecliptic rela tion The gas area points upward and for ward with the motion of the helix like a flame and the rock area points downward and backward toward the center of the earth The way the rocks and meteorites find orderly ar rangement on this area from the light alka line to the heavy ferric groups is very sug gestive The rock area typifies the increasing stability of the downward curves of increas ing valence density and condensation The gas area is its striking antithesis Attention may be called to the quadrilateral of life CHON in the center of the figure surrounded by the elements on which life sub ordinately depends These last are almost the only unsymmetrical relations A remarkable result is reached in figures not reproduced here by placing the elements on the helix in their true positions as deter mined by the real differences between succes sive elements rather than by the average dif ferences for each type of circle It is found that the agreement with the ideal position is much less perfect than might have been ex pected and curious and unexpected sym metries come to light It is further found that 648 SCIENCENOVEMBER 10 1911 the elements can be nearly as well placed on the curve by using the successive differences rTam 0 wTr  0 III

each element is separated from its ideal position taken with opposite sign This brings into clear light the relative im portance of valence atomic weight density and the ideal  position The atomic weights have had a primary value in placing the elements nearly in that natural order FIG 5 Ecliptic Relations Refractivity in detail The large number on the right is the coefficient of refractivity The small one on the left represents the factor to be multiplied into the constant at the border to obtain this refractivity would represent the value of the remaining functions which influence the position of the elements We must perhaps go back to the conditions of formation of the elements to find these values reduced to zero which has brought out their periodic or har monic relations and the suggestion of a position of ideal symmetry It had some thing the value of a scaffolding to the com pleted building 650 SCIENCENNoVEMBE 10 1911 3 Evolution and Devolution The helix is a working model and it sug gests that there is only one enduring stable As the vixgeneratrix passed over each unit space in the first circle the conditions favored the formation of a new element In this cir J  PIG 6

between das Urstoff cle are the simplest forms of matter from and hydrogen with its thousand corpuscles hydrogen to helium They appear abundantly and if that element be coronium it has en in the nebulae existing and perhaps formed dured only under the exceptional conditions near the absolute zero where no heat vibra of the corona tions could yet be predicated and where unex SCIENCE 651 IN S VOL XXXIV No 880 plained electrical activities could cause the light of the nebulae The helix prophesies the discovery of only one new element of low atomic weight proto fluorine and an intensi fied fluorine would naturally be a difficult ele ment to capture On the completion of the first circle a double momentum swelled the curve to a full octave culminating in the unique element carbon the element of life and in a second octave culminating in silicon the basis of the rocks In contrast to the corpuscular tem perature or vibration within the atom in the elements of the nebulae normal molecular vi bration and normal electrical conditions be came prevalent On passing potassium the treble momentum culminated in a double octave with the iron nickelcobalt group of the hot stars the meteorites and the interior of the earth see top of Fig 1 One may surmise that most of the heavy elements beyond this group are unimportant in the mass of the earth as they are in the meteorites A considerable molecu lar radiation may have been a condition precedent for the addition of a group of cor puscles equivalent to three hydrogen atoms and the increasing complexity of the elements is indicated by their high and varying valence Will three new elements be found to fill the gaps below Mn or will the outer triads be robbed for this purpose The almost empty semicircle between Yb and Ta is tantalizing but the helix would rule out the gathering of the elements of the rare earths into a group like the triads The sun carries the evolution a step further and it is conceivable that all the elements of the lowestfusing quadrant have evaporated from it Lead alone of the very heavy ele ments appears in the sun as a sort of calx or caput mortuum suggesting that evaporation into helium has reached its limit there It is remarkable that at the farthest place from this volatile quadrant at the outermost curve of the highfusing semicircle the radium ele ments should be evaporating with explosive heat and lightgiving violence over all the surface of the earth should exist in the outer layers of the earth only and should be brought up by the light and highly acid pegmatite whose quartz grains have been formed below 8004 Beckers suggestion of the genesis of pegmatite with uranium as a potentializer of the energy that must escape in its formation is most interesting When the assemblages had become so com plex that devolution began to prevail over evo lution the size of the added group of cor puscles increased to four and a short advance only was made along the first quadrupleoctave ring If ink is allowed to flow from a dropping tube the point of which is immersed in water in a tall glass the descending stream soon forms vortex rings and as these rings sink and expand they often become scalloped at the edges and the scallops expand in lobes which separate in distinct subordinate vortex rings while the central part closes in as an almost perfect ring again Sometimes several of these lobes will separate symmetrically at the same time like the fluting on the border of a rose leaf This is a model of the radium emanations and of the breaking up of the complex atoms Thus is the limit set to the complexity of the atom and the length of the helix It has a mystical attractiveness that the helix has a shape like the spiral nebula from which all things have been thought to origi nate and toward wlich they again tend and that the tetrahedral element carbon stands in the center of this helix and by its shapes ranging from the tetrahedron which in cludes the smallest amount of matter in unit surface almost to the sphere which contains the largest amount of matter in unit surface typifies the infinite possibilities of life of which it is the vehicle and embodies the tetra hedral form which the earth has repeatedly if imperfectly assumed B K EMERSON 4 Day and Shepard Am Jour Sc Vol XX p 276 1906 6 G F Becker  Radioactivity and Cosmogony

Presidentelect Adjournment THE GRAND RAPIDS CONVENTIONS OCTOBER 2125 1913 The seventh annual convention of the National Society for the Pro motion of Industrial Education and the organization meeting of the National Vocational Guidance Association were held at Grand Rapids Michigan October I9 to 25 698EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT The citizens of Grand Rapids had made unusually thorough prepara tion for the reception of their guests and the programs of both societies gave promise of rich reward to those who might attend them It was to be expected that this would be the largest conference in the history of the National Society and also would bring together a considerable num ber of those interested in the organization of the new Vocational Guidance Association Even more significant than the notable increase in the num ber of delegates was the fact that they represented a much wider terri tory than formerly indicating a spread of interest in vocational education and guidance toward the west and south THE NATIONAL VOCATIONAL GUIDANCE ASSOCIATION As it seems desirable for the purpose of this review to consider as one convention the meetings of both societies a prefatory word is neces sary regarding the organization of the National Vocational Guidance Association This association is the outgrowth of a movement started in Boston in I9Io and brought to the point of organization at New York in I912 when the Second National Conference on Vocational Guidance provided for an organization committee This committee called the present confer ence and consummated the organization This new association has been brought into existence with the full appreciation of the fact that educational associations are multiplying rapidly At the same time it was felt that the term vocational guid ance had taken such a prominent place in the recent discussions of edu cational questions and that so many widely divergent practices were being inaugurated in its name that for a time at least the careful thought and earnest investigation of the men and women especially interested in this phase of social and educational work might be made more effective by purposeful joint action Especially was it felt that the association might serve as an agent for the collection and distribu tion of information as to what is being done in different states in the furtherance of the purposes of vocational guidance GENERAL NATURE OF THE PROGRAM The conference as a whole was marked by the emphasis given to the consideration of methods and to details of management rather than to the discussion of theories However there was due recognition of the fact that the movement is still new and that the majority of teachers school officers and employers throughout the whole country are only 699THE SCHOOL REVIEW slightly interested and are therefore in need of such inspiration and enlightenment as only a great convention can give The addresses which were given for this purpose while relatively few were excellent and effective and the impetus given to the movement in Michigan alone by this means will be one of the important results of the conven tions Papers relating to the larger social economic and educational phases of vocational education and vocational guidance were presented by such speakers as Mr William C Redfield Miss Ida M Tarbell Professor George Herbert Mead Mr Owen R Lovejoy Miss Sophonisba P Breckinridge and Dr Leonard P Ayres To recount the deeply significant lessons of these addresses would be impossible within the limits of this review but all emphasized the great need of developing a higher degree of efficiency in the workers of the rising generation and contended that the recognition of this need was consistent with the highest social and educational ideals Though inspirational in nature these addresses generally based their theories on an accurate statement of accepted facts rather than on visionary ideas of what society ought to be THESES OF VOCATIONAL EDUCATION A few of the specific points of thoroughly practical application which were made in these inspirational addresses are as follows i Vocational guidance and industrial education have already demon strated their ability to retain children in school two or three years beyond the compulsory limit thus extending the influence of our systematic cultural education while training practical efficiency 2 Guidance and training will increase both the income of the employer and the wage of the worker and it is the duty of the educator to see that the benefit to the former does not overshadow the interests of the latter 3 Our schools need the influence which the industries can exert over them quite as much as industry needs the help of the school When this influence is rightly applied the school curriculum will be shot through and through with industrial interpretation 4 While it may be necessary for many children early to become wage workers every effort should be made to save them from long periods of stulti fying labor 5 Traditional education has valuable characteristics which should be carried over into the new types of schoolsstability continuity and balance 6 The recurrent attacks on our schools by employers are futile but the interest and cooperation of the employer provide one of the most important doors through which the community gains admittance to its schools 700EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 7 Without the influence of the outside world the schools unconsciously exercise an unfortunate and negative vocational guidance for the majority of our early adolescent children The forward educational movement is but a part of the great social advance in the midst of which the present generation is living and consequently the social worker who of necessity is a student of conditions as they are wields an influence which is of first importance These workers by scientific methods are gradually establishing a fact basis regarding industrial and social conditions upon which the school authorities can safely rely and the school activities be securely built 8 We should distinguish between the emergency problem with which we are now confronted and the workingout of a rational system of guidance and training for a later generation in the former case we must make the most of the present available jobs and wise use of supplementary educational agencies but choosing positions for people is preferable to choosing people for positions 9 The employer of those whom we call unskilled factory workers has been caught in the maelstrom of fierce competition and needs not so much our criticism as our help not alone for his sake but especially for the sake of his employees io All this points to the supreme need of exercising patience which means moving step by step THE NEW YORK VS THE WISCONSIN PLAN As noted above most of the addresses dealt concretely with ques tions of method but even these were not without their inspirational moments Two such questions were Should Michigan have voca tional education under unit or dual control  and Should Michigan have compulsory parttime education now or work toward it gradually by passing through the stages of voluntary schemes with state aid local option later this to be followed by statewide compulsory law  The discussion of these questions brought forth some of the finest state ments of the fundamental principles which underlie industrial education that were made during the whole convention But the issue was in a very genuine sense a practical one and might have been stated as the names of the speakers would indicate as follows Should Michigan follow the lead of New York state or of Wisconsin in providing for stateaided vocational education  The speakers from Wisconsin were Louis E Reber dean of University Extension Division University of Wisconsin Madison Wisconsin and Warren E Hicks deputy superintendent for industrial education state of Wisconsin and from New York State were John Dewey professor of philosophy Columbia University New 70ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW York City and Arthur D Dean chief of Division of Vocational Schools New York State A large part of the discussion of these questions centered around certain resolutions which were issued in circular form from the office of the state superintendent of public instruction Madison Wisconsin September 22 I913 and upon which we commented editorially in our last issue It may be said the Dr Deweys opinions were in substantial agreement with our editorial and that Mr Deans article will be found in full in the January number of the School Review The representatives of the Wisconsin plan dwelt upon the efficiency of limiting or confining the work in the beginning to the training of selfsupporting wageworkers in continuation schools and of leaving to the future the development of breadth and catholicity THE TRAINING OF GIRLS AND WOMEN The largest meeting of the convention was that held for the discus sion of important questions relating specifically to the training of girls and women The program might have been referred to under any of the classifications used in this review for it was at once inspirational informational and constructive This meeting shared with the meeting on legislation the distinction of presenting the only questions on which there was any actual controversy It would seem that there are rational grounds for genuine differences of opinion as to whether industrial training or homemaking should receive the major emphasis in the education of the girls and women for whose advancement the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education is working That some girls need one kind of training to the exclusion of the other that this question is one which preeminently demands consideration of the individual and that there is danger of losing sight of the real issues in a cloud of uninformed sentiment was shown all too clearly THE PROGRAM IN PART The papers which dealt in most minute detail with present and pressing problems confronting the educational and social worker in both vocational guidance and industrial education were as follows How Can the Evening School Best Meet the Needs of the WageWorker  I The Use of the Short Unit Course in PartTime and Evening Schools Wesley A OLeary director Evening Teachers Training Class for Trade Workers Pratt Institute New York A short unit course is a brief course or limited number of lessons meeting some specific and common need or

that it is expected that the papers read before the National Vocational Guidance Association will be issued as a bulletin of the United States Bureau of Education The proceedings of the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education are issued from the office of the society in New York City In this connection may be mentioned the report of the Committee on the Certification and Training of Teachers This report represents the work of a special committee Mr A Lincoln Filene chairman appointed last year to consider this most important question While revisions are still to be 703THE SCHOOL REVIEW made the tentative report which is now in print will be of great value to those who are organizing industrial schools or classes Meetings of the local womens clubs teachers associations the Association of Commerce the Central Labor Union the official repre sentatives of state departments of vocational education and the Sunday services in the churches all offered opportunities for spreading the information relating to this great movement to improve the opportunities for genuine popular education Eighteen addresses were made at morn ing and evening services in the churches on the Sunday preceding the convention and the last conference was held Saturday afternoon thus filling the week completely with discussions related to vocational guid ance and industrial education While not wholly pedagogical the convention was pronounced by one of the bestknown educators of the Middle West to be an educational convention of high order In one respect it showed a marked contrast to most conventions of teachers where the same or kindred topics are discussed in that it was almost wholly lacking in violent and indiscrimi nate criticism of the publicschool system The whole conference gave one the impression that those present were determined to broaden the scope of the public schools so that these popular institutions will make for vocational efficiency in those who cannot have or who do not desire the extended schooling leading to the professional and directive voca tions and to secure their social advance wherever possible not alone by training but by employment supervision if not by actual guidance into positions and to maintain that such guardianship should be accepted by school authorities not only as a duty but also as a rich opportunity and a consecrated pleasure F M L SEEKING THE RIGHT KIND OF COOPERATION The following letter is suggestive of a new line of endeavor for the public schools MIDDLETOWN CONN September 2 I913 To Prospective Employers of HighSchool Pupils or Graduates Middletown Conn GENTLEMEN OR LADIES There are each year in our high school a number of boys and girls who need to work afternoons and Saturdays in order to pay their expenses while getting an education or who would be greatly benefited by some such work Some pupils would be glad to work in exchange for board and room We have a form which these pupils fill out and which we keep on file for 704EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT reference It includes information concerning the age the amount of educa tion the name and address of former employers and of references the kinds of work previously done the kinds of work that the pupil can do and prefers and the time when and how much he or she can devote to outofschool work Besides this information we learn from a personal acquaintance with the pupils and their progress and behavior in school considerable about the physical and mental fitness and general reliability for different kinds of work Last year the greatest demand was not for boys but for girls and the work was tending children or assisting in light housework While we cannot agree always to secure for a prospective employer just the sort of pupil he may desire for any work still we shall be very glad to assist to the best of our ability in finding the right workman There is another very important part of this letter What employment worth while can you offer any of our graduates boys or girls who on leaving us wish to enter such promising fields of work as their own city can offer them  Our graduates have been instructed in the following courses the general or English the classical and after June 1914 the commercial the industrial and agricultural course for boys and the practical arts course for girls which course covers considerable instruction in drawing home decoration sewing launder ing cooking etc If you wish to employ any of our graduates or if you would care to do so provided they were instructed and trained to do certain things not included in our present courses or to do them better than graduates in the pastif you need or may need the services of any of our graduates or if you have any suggestions to offer concerning the improvement of the education we give in high school kindly feel free to communicate in full your needs and suggestions We ask your cooperation in making our high school fulfill properly and adequately its function Did you ever think that one of the most serious as well as constant losses Middletown suffers is to allow annually the flower of her youth the graduates from her local high school to leave her borders in order to earn a livelihood  Are there practically no openings worth while as a lifework for our graduates here in Middletown  Is there any way the Middletown Business Mens Associa tion or the Twentieth Century Club or anyone else can arrange so that we can save our city this irreparable loss of young blood brains and energy that should be kept here and made to build up a larger better busier and more beautiful Middletown  If you need the services of any of our students for part time or of any of our graduates or other students who may be obliged to leave school before graduation kindly write us explaining fully and definitely the nature of the work and the kind of pupil desired Thanking you for your cooperation I am Very truly yours W A WHEATLEY Superintendent of Schools 705THE SCHOOL REVIEW CREDIT FOR OUTSIDE WORK The Board of Education of St Cloud Minnesota has adopted the most elaborate scheme for giving credit for outside work that has come to the attention of the School Review The purpose according to a bulletin published by the board is to unite the home and the school to connect the work of the school with things going forward outside and to encourage the children to spend a part of their spare time at some use ful occupationin a measure to direct their work along the line of practical everyday homely tasksto give all a chance and to train them for work and service not merely the acquisition of knowledge that they may the better fit into actual conditions about themto pre pare for complete livingto make the watchword industrial social and home efficiency It will be noted below that the better class of students are given more opportunity to engage in outside work the weaker students are allowed only one credit out of sixteen and safeguarding the whole plan is the provision that a very large share of the students time at least 1 is given to the older subjects of the curriculum Following is given the plan as outlined by the Superintendent of the St Cloud schools THE HIGHSCHOOL DIPLOMA For graduation I6 Units are required at least 15 of which shal be regular school

open window I6 Keeping a systematic savingsbank account for one year with regular monthly deposits SUPPLEMENTARY STATEMENT Thus succintly the superintendent summarizes important supple mentary considerations The range of activities offers a wide choice and nearly every student who has been taught to help at home or who works during vacation will be able to make at least one unit The credits are not to be given in lieu of any of the essential subjects now offered in the high school A clear concise backbone of academic work is retained The plan is elective and suggestive and does not interfere in any way with the members of the advanced classes Students are encouraged to work for extra credits and to graduate with credit or honor No student unless very mature is allowed to graduate in three years The aim is not to cut down the highschool course but to enrich it and so modify the curriculum as to shape the education of the boys and make them wage earners whenever they find it necessary to become such either through choice or by compulsion OUTDOOR SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA Superintendent of Public Instruction Hyatt has just issued a small illustrated brochure dealing with the subject of outdoor schoolhouses in California Its illustrations are based upon a Fresno example a building that was constructed for a trifle under 500 and concerning it Superintendent Hyatt says In appearance the building is tasteful and beautiful It has no glass windows yet the light through the canvas panelswhich can be raised entirely around the buildingis more perfect and more agreeable than in any other building It has only one door It is heated by a little airtight stove It is so perfectly ventilated that the teachers and the children very much prefer it to any other  Naturally canvas and screen wire are not as solid and permanent as brick and mortar yet the frame floor and roof being substan tial the canvas tightstretched and the screening well put on the building will give service for a number of years It seems to afford all desirable protection against both wind and rain In our California climate it is much more whole some in every way for the children than the proudest structure in the state The crux of the argument is suggested in the last sentence In our California climate these outdoor schoolhouses are more desirable than they possibly can be in a climate more rigorous In the east such schools may be considered an experiment Here where severe cold is unknown their success cannot be doubted It is as if nature herself invited to the outer air and the effect of such air in revivifying the intellect beyond anything that artificial ventilation can do is understood 708

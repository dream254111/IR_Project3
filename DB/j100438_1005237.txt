J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1005237,EXPANSION OF F X  H,I241966,ARTICLE XI ESPANSION OF F X  H BY PIKE POMERS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA READ APRIL 2 1841 A FUNCTION MAY BE REGARDED AS THE GENERAL EXPRESSION OF A SERIES OF NUM BERS WHICH VARY ACCORDING TO SOME GIVEN LAW TLLE PLACE OR NUMBER OF THE TERM BEING DENOTED BY X AND ITS VALUE BY FX THE SERIES MAY ALWAYS BE REPRESENTED WHOLLY OR IN PART BY A CURVE WHOSE ORDINATES CORRESPOND TO THE DIFFERENT VALUES OF FX AND ITS ABSCISSAS TO THOSE OF X IN ANY FUNCTION CERTAIN VALUES MAY ALWAYS BE ASSIGNED TO X BETWEEN WHICH THE DIFFERENCE OF ANY TWO CONSECUTIVE VALUES OF FX WILL NOT BE INFINITELY GREATER THAN THE DIFFERENCE OF THE CORRESPONDING VALUES OF X THE ONLY FUNCTIONS WHICH THE WRITER CAN CONCEIVE OF AS NOT SUBJECT TO THE PRECEDING REMARK ARE 1 SUCH AS UNDERGO INCESSANTLY ABRUPT CHANGES FROM INCREASE TO DECREASE OR THE REVERSE 2 THOSE WHICH WHILE THEY VARY IN THE SAME SENSE THROUGH A FINITE INTERVAL YET UNDERGO ALWAYS AN INFINITE CHANGE FOR A FINITE CHANGE IN X IT SEEMS OBVIOUS HOWEVER THAT IF SUCH FUNCTIONS CAN BE ANALYTICALLY EXPRESSED THEY CANINOT ADMIT OF TAYLORS THEOREM SEE NOTE SUPPOSING X TO BE CONFINED WITHIN THE LIMITS REFERRED TO ABOVE WE HAVE F X H FX X H 1 H P X H REDUCING TO A FINITE QUANTITY MP X  0 WHEN H  0 IN LIKE MANNER WE MAY WRITE P X HM X O  T X H OR CP X H  P X 0  H P X  H WHERE H V X  H  0 WHEN H  0 NOW IF C Z  H SHOULD BE FINITE WHEN H  0 WE SHOULD HAVE P X  H P X    H   X H156 EXPANSION OF F X  H AND BY CONTINUING THIS PROCESS AND SUBSTITUTING FOR I X  H Q X H Q X  H C THEIR VALUES WE SHOULD GET EASILY THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT OF F X  H BUT LET US SUPPOSE THAT C X  0 IS INFINITE THAT IS THAT AS H APPROACHES 0 Q X  H INCREASES WITHOUT LIMIT ACCORDING TO A LAW DEPENDING UPON THE FORM OF THE FUNCTION WHATEVER THIS LAW MAY BE AS FUNCTIONS VANISHING WITH H ADMIT OF AN INFI NITE DIVERSITY OF FORM IT SEEMS OBVIOUS THAT THERE MUST BE SOME ONE F H SUCH THAT V F I SHALL INCREASE WITH THE SAME RATE AS P X  H I X 0 BEING FH FINITE WE MAY WRITE THEN H P X H H Q X H J H AS FH IS INFERIOR TO H IN DEGREE SINCE H P X  H VANISHES WITH H AND AS THE POWERS OF H ADMIT OF EVERY SHADE OF MAGNITUDE AND DIMINISH TOWARDS 0 WITH EVERY POSSIBLE DEGREE OF RAPIDITY IT APPEARS EVIDENT THAT FOR VERY SMALL VALUES OF H F H MAY BE REPLACED BY HV WHERE V  1 HENCE H CFLXHH 7V QFHA QF WHERE A  1V AND Q IS SO CHOSEN AS TO AGREE WITH QCV X IH FOR VERY SMALL VALUES OF H BY SIMILAR REASONING WE HAVE Q P X  0  H Q PUTTING Q FOR C X  H WE MAY WRITE 1 UNDER THE FORM FXHFXH Q AND IF WE REPLACE P X  0 PI X  0 C BY P P C WE SHALL HAVE FXHFXH Q Q PH Q Q  H Q Q IFN PFIN HO Q Q BEING FINITE WHEN H  0 MULTIPLYING THE 2D EQUATION BY H THE 3D BY H 1 N C ADDING AND PUTTING A FOR 1  A B FOR 1

SIMPLE TRANSFORMATION R TAKING THE PLACE OF H Q X  H AND CONSEQUENTLY VANISHING WITH H IS SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH ALL THE RULES OF DIFFERENTIATION OBSERVING THAT IN THE PRECEDING INVESTIGATION X WAS CONFINED WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS WHILE H REMAINED ARBITRARY WE MAY REPLACE X BY A NUMBER R WITHIN THE LIMITS SUPPOSED AND H BY X  R WHICH DENOTES THE VARIABLE DIFFERENCE BE TWEEN THE GENERAL AND SPECIAL

WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT EACH TERM IN THESE EQUATIONS IS THE ONLY ONE WHICH CON TAINS THE POWER OF X  R PECULIAR TO IT FOR IF THERE WERE SEVERAL TERMS CONTAIN ING THE SAME POWER OF X  R THEY MIGHT BE UNITED INTO ONE OBSERVING NOW THAT THE EXPONENTS A B C C ARE EACH GREATER THAN UNITY AND ARE ARRANGED IN ASCENDING ORDER IF WE MAKE X  R AND SUPPOSE DU D 2U C TO REMAIN FINITE THE FIRST OF EQUATIONS 3 BECOMES DU P A RESULT ALREADY ESTABLISHED AND IMPLIED IN THE PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATING WITH REGARD TO THE 2D EQUATION WE MUST HAVE A  2 OR A  2 OR A  2 IF A  2 EVERY TERM IN THE 2D MEMBER ANTECEDENT TO M WILL VANISH AND IF M DOES NOT VANISH IT MUST EITHER BE FINITE OR INFINITE BUT SINCE D 8 IS FINITE M CANNOT BE INFINITE IF IT REDUCES TO A FINITE QUANTITY A THEN M  SEE MR BONNYCASTLES PAPER PAGES 245 246 VOL VII OF THESE TRANSACTIONS VIII2 P158 EXPANSION OF F X  H MUST CONTAIN A TERM A X  R AND M A TERM A X  R2 AND IT IS ONLY NE CESSARY TO GIVE THIS TERM ITS PROPER PLACE IN THE SERIES IN ORDER TO GET THE SAME RESULT WHICH A  2 WILL FURNISH IF A  2 THE 1ST TERM WILL BE INFINITE AND CANNOT BE CANCELLED BY ANY OF THE TERMS ANTECEDENT TO M SINCE THEY ALL CON TAIN POWERS OF X  R DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST NOR BY ANY TERM IN M SINCE THAT TERM WOULD THEN CONTAIN THE SAME POWER OF X  R WITH THE FIRST WHICH IS CONTRARY TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE SERIES WE MUST HAVE THEN A  2 THEREFORE A A 1  1

VALUE OF X BETWEEN THE SUPPOSED LIMITS THE RESULTS OBTAINED ARE EVIDENTLY GENERAL AND WILL GIVE ALL THE TERMS OF THE SERIES UNTIL WE REACH A CO EFFICIENT WHICH BECOMES INFINITE FOR X  R AND THEN THE REMAINDER OF THE EX PANSION MUST BE SUPPLIED IN SOME OTHER WAY USING THE NOTATION OF LAGRANGE WE HAVE GENERALLY THEREFORE FXFR  FR X R  FR XR2   X RSQ WHICH WHEN R  0 BECOMES X2 FX  F XF0  F 0

COMPLETE THE READER WILL FIND A SUMMARY VIEW OF THIS METHOD IN THE SUBJOINED NOTE FURNISHING ITSELF AN EXACT THOUGH INDIRECT SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEMEXPANSION OF F X  H 159 NOTE THE VALIDITY OF THE REASONING USED IN THE FOREGOING DEMONSTRATION TO SHOW THE EXISTENCE OF F X IN A FINITE FORM IN ALL CASES WHERE X IS CONFINED WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS WILL PERHAPS APPEAR MORE EVIDENT FROM THE FOLLOWING REMARKS POSTULATE 1 THERE ARE NO FUNCTIONS WHICH THROUGHOUT THEIR WHOLE RANGE OF VALUES CHANGE IN CESSANTLY FROM INCREASE TO DECREASE AS X VARIES AND THAT BY QUANTITIES INFINITELY GREATER THAN THE CHANGE IN X IT IS SCARCELY POSSIBLE TO GIVE THE GRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF SUCH FUNCTIONS MUCH LESS THEIR ANALYTICAL EXPRESSION A LINE CONTINUALLY RETURNING UPON ITSELF THUS  OR A SPIRAL WHOSE COILS ARE COMPRESSED INTO ALMOST ABSOLUTE CONTACT WOULD BE AN APPROXIMATIVE EXPRESSION OF THEM WE CONCLUDE THEN THAT IN ANY FUNCTION FX VALUES A AND A  N H MAY BE ASSIGNED TO X DIFFERING BY A FINITE QUANTITY N H AND SUCH THAT FROM FA TO F A  N H FX SHALL CONSTANTLY IN CREASE OR CONSTANTLY DECREASE POSTULATE 2 THERE ARE NO FUNCTIOLIS WHICH WHILE THEY UNDERGO A CONSTANT INCREASE OR DECREASE THROUGH FINITE INTERVALS OF VALUE YET ALWAYS RECEIVE AN INFINITE CHANGE FOR A FINITE CHANGE IN X AND HERE WE AGAIN APPEAL TO OBSERVATION AND THE APPARENT IMPOSSIBILITY OF EXHIBITING SUCH FUNC TIONS IN EITHER A GEOMETRIC OR ALGEBRAIC FORM TLHEOREM 1 NOW SUPPOSE THAT F X  H  FX APPROACHES INFINITY AS H APPROACHES 0 FOR ALL VALUES OF X THEN THE FOLLOWING RATIOS FXHFX FX2HFXH FX3HFX2H FXJNHFXNIH H  H H  H WILL ALL BE INFINITELY GREAT WHEN H IS INFINITELY SMALL LET N BE TAKEN SO GREAT THAT N H SHALL BE FINITE AND LET X BE SUCH THAT FX CONSTANTLY INCREASES OR CONSTANTLY DECREASES FROM FX TO F X  N H THE NUMERATORS OF THE PRECEDING RATIOS WILL BE ALL OF THE SAME SIGN THEIR SUM IS OBVIOUSLY F X  N H  FX AND IF P DENOTE THE LEAST OF THESE NUMERATORS N P F X  N H  FX BUT P N P  HENCE NP X  N HFX H N H NH BUT THIS RESULT IS IMPOSSIBLE BY POSTULATE 2 HENCE IN ANY FUNCTION FX THERE MUST BE SOME VALUES OF X SUCH THAT FX  H FX A FINITE QUANTITY F X WHEN H 0 FROM WHICH WE READILY DERIVE F X  H  FX  H FX  H R R VANISHING WITH H AS TO THE METHOD USED BY LAGRANGE TO DETERMINE THE LIMITS OF THE EXPANSION OF F X  A IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO OBSERVE THAT WHEN THE EXISTENCE OF THE DIFFERENTIAL COEFFICIENTS IN A FINITE FORM IS ADMITTED THIS METHOD FURNISHES IN ALL CASES AN EXACT AND SIMPLE MODE OF EXHIBITING THE TRUE VALUE OF F X  H THIS FACT HAS BEEN MOST SINGULARLY OVERLOOKED160 EXPANSION OF F X  H CAUCHY APPARENTLY AND DE MORGAN CONFESSEDLY HAVE MADE LAGRANGES METHOD THE BASIS OF THEIR DEMONSTRATIONS OF TAYLORS THEOREM WE WILL NOW EXHIBIT THE METHOD OF LAGRANGE AFTER PREMISING THAT THE EQUATION FX  H  FX  H FX  H R WILL READILY ESTABLISH THE FOLLOWING WELL KNOWN THEOREM THIEOREM 2 WHEN FX IS POSITIVE FX AND X VARY IN THE SAME SENSE AND WHEN NEGATIVE IN AN OPPOSITE SENSE CONSEQUENTLY IF F 0  0 AND F 0 BE NOT INFINITE FX WILL BE POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AT THE SAME TIME WITH X WHEN F X IS POSITIVE LET US SUPPOSE THAT FOR X  A AND X  B AND FOR ALL INTERMEDIATE VALUES F X F X   FN X ARE ALL FINITE AND CONTINUOUS AND LET US REPLACE X BY A  H H ADMITTING ALL VALUES FROM 0 TO B  A NOW LET  AND B BE THE GREATEST AND LEAST VALUES OF F A  H THEN  F A  H  0 AND F A  H  B  0 HENCE THE PRIMITIVES OF THESE EXPRESSIONS TAKEN WITH REGARD TO H AND SO AS TO VANISH WITH H WILL LIKEWISE BE POSITIVE THEOREM 2 IH  FA  H  FA  0 AND FA  S  BH  FA  0 NEXT LET D AND B BE THE GREATEST AND LEAST VALUES OF F A  IH THEN D  F A  H  0 AND F A  H B 0 BY TAKING THE PRIMITIVES AS BEFORE WE HAVE DH  F A  H  FA  O AND F A  HBHFA  O AND BY TAKING THEM AGAIN WE HAVE  FAH HFAFAO AND FAHB  2HFAFA 0 OR FA  H  FA  H  FA  1 2

LEAST VALUES OF FN A  H HENCE IF FN A  H BE CONTINUOUS AND H  B A THERE WILL BE SOME VALUE F A  O H INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN I N AND B N SUCH THAT FA HFAHFA 1 FA 1 23 N FNA OH WHERE 0  1 THIS IS PRECISELY THE EXPRESSION OBTAINED BY CAUCHY IT IS GENERAL SINCE A IS ANY VALUE OF X SUBJECT TO THE CONDITIONS STATED AND IT GIVES ALWAYS THE EXACT VALUE OF F X  H WHEN X AND H ARE SUCH THAT FN X  O H SHALL BE FINITE SINCE 1 WILL ALWAYS FINALLY CONVERGEEXPANSION OF F X  H 161 WITH REGARD TO THE NEGATIVE VALUES OF H WE SHALL HAVE BY THEOREM 2 Q F A  H  0 F A  H B  O DHHFAH  FA  0 FAH  BHFA  0 OR FA  H  FA H FA  H  FA  BH AND THE REASONING CONTINUED AS BEFORE WILL LEAD TO A SIMILAR RESULT IT MAY BE OBSERVED IN CONCLUSION THAT THE INTEGRATIONS EFFECTED ABOVE ARE PERFECTLY ALLOWABLE SINCE THE EQUATION FX  H FX  H  FX  H  R IS SUFFICIENT FOR ALL PURPOSES OF DIFFERENTIATION AND INTEGRATION AND IT IS IMMATERIAL WHETHER ANY OTHER PRIMITIVES THAN THOSE OBTAINED EXIST SINCE WE ARE NOT SEEKING THE ONLY

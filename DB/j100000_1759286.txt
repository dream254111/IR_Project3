ate every thing grapevines excepted The swarms were so thick that the sun could not be seen and they went farther to the shores of the Mediterrane an But the eggs and the young ones hatched from them were left behind therefore a process was begun against them The grasshoppers were condemned and excommunicated by the priest of Kaltern The judgment was framed as follows  As grasshoppers are obnoxious to the country and to men be it resolved by the court that the priest shall by candles burning from the pulpit condemn them in the name of God of his Son and of the Holy Ghost A similar process was begun in the year 1516 against caterpillars in Troyes France H A HAGEN THE LOWER FORMS OF LIFE DREDGED BY THE TALISMANl ACTINIAS generally known as seaanemones at tract attention both by the beauty of their forms and by their bfight and varied colors They are represented in the deepest waters and some forms gath ered on bottoms at from four thousand to five thousand metres possess a color as beautiful as that of the shore species Madrepores have a carbonateoflime skeleton They are present sometimes in abundance to a depth of twenty five hundred me tres Madrepore branchus

and especially affect muddy bottoms and they have beautifully varied forms some resein bling a cup others a horn and still others having the form of flowers Various forms of alcyonarians a special

interesting alcyonarian Coralliopsis Perieri which much resembled Danas Corallium secundum of the Fiji Islands Isis and Mopseas see fig 1 with slender rods formed of a series of calcareous cylinders supporting flowerlike polyps with eight bipinnated tentacles were taken at twentyfive hundred metres Other forims with gorgons having a horny axis with metallic reflections like gold people with their graceful forms the abysses of the ocean The sponges form one of the most interesting parts of the Talisman collection One generally thinks of these as always possessing the characteristics of our commercial sponges When one sees their wonderful tissui fsormed of needles interwoven with glistering whiteirockcrystal one is impressed first with sur prise and then with admiration Sponges are dis tributed from the coast to the greatest depths explored five thousand and five metres The littoral or shal lowwater fornms have a horny or calcareous skeleton while those living at great depths have a skeleton formed of siliceous spicules sometimes free some timnes joined into a network The most remarkable siliceous sponges are Holtenia shaped like a birds Ilest having at the circumference or else only at the base a long cheve lure of siliceous threads enabling it to anchor to the bottom Euplectel las having the form of a long trellised horn and Hyalo nema and Chondro chladia see fig 1 which

themselves from the central part and some of them on coming in contact with solid bodies or rocks or corals attach themselves very closely The upper portion of the sponge see fig 1 is closed by an elegantly formed siliceous bas ketwork As the colony increases several of these trellises are formed The last animals to be mentioned the Protozoa172 SOCI are the most degraded in organization and

made very slow movements Within it were calcareous corpuscles of peculiar shape which some naturalists thought to be the prod ucts of the protoplasm itself while others thought it the debris of calcareous algae Huxley called it Bathybius Haeckeli This discovery caused a great sensation and it was questioned whether this living slime did not at certain periods undergo evolu tion and then give rise to new creatures Wyville Thomson could not find Bathybius and it was dis covered that previous observers had been deceived by a chemical reaction The supposed Monera was nothing more than a simple gelatinous precipitate of sulphate of lime as it forms when concentrated alcohol is turned into seawater The mode of pres ervation of the lime had created Bathybius Here the general description of the results of the cruise of the Talisman is brought to a close Yet I have thought it would be interesting to show the result of our researches on temperatures at great depths and I have drawn two curves fig 3 the upper showing the thermometric records the lower the corresponding depths On examination it will be noticed that they do not always agree Thus the lowest temperature we found was at 3432 metres while it was a little higher at 5000 and 6000 metres From this the importance of deep currents and the part they play in the distribution of life in the ocean may be judged Another curve

worn by the Prince Min Yong Ik one at a time and usually on the thumb of the right hand apparently rather more as an object to play with than as an ornament FRANCE One of them supposed by the Rhassiron prince to be jade was found on ex 1000 amination to be serpentine hard 3000 ness 45 and specific gravity 262   X4000 It waswhite in color with an oily u 000 x lustre and had on it a number

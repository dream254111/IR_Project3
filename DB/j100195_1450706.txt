j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450706,Prof Dalman on Christianity and Judaism,i263163,THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW CRITICAL NOTICES PROF DALMAN ON CHRISTIANITY AND JUDAISM Christenthum und Judenthum von Dr GUSTAF DALMAN 1898 I FEEL very guilty that this most remarkable pamphlet should not have been noticed in the JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW at an earlier date To say the truth although Dr Dalmans essay has been in my possession for more than a year I did not read it till a few days ago Having read it I felt it my duty to give an account of it in these columns To call the pamphlet remarkable is smaller praise than it deserves Dr Dalman seems to be a rare exception among the Protestant theologians of Germany To begin with he is a firstclass authority in Rabbinic His scientific work has already been quoted with respect by Dr Schechter as standing quite outside and above the ordinary productions of Christian scholars He himself is perfectly alive to the faults and inadequacies of the much quoted Weberthe one universal authority among Protestant divines for all matters of Rabbinic theology In the first part of his important book Die Worte Jesu he shows his mastery of the Talmudic material He is far from repeating or believing in the ordinary platitudes about the burdensome law the horrors of Nomismus and the miseries of the Rabbinic religion so often assumed and dilated on by one selfcomplacent theologian after another The unanswered castigation so justly inflicted by Mr I Abrahams upon the otherwise monumental work of Schiirer would not in the least apply to him He is an opponent with whom our best and wisest champions might be delighted to cross swords Moreover Dr Dalman is not merely acquainted with Talmud and Midrash but he is also familiar with modern Jewish literature He knows the feelings and opinions of modern Jews both of the orthodox and reform divisions And yet this enlightened unprejudiced and wellinformed man is an earnest evangelical Christian convinced of the superiority and truth of his own creed and while quite fair to the other side an uncompromising exponent of what he believes to be its weakness and deficiencies A truly remarkable combination 736CRITICAL NOTICES 737 Dr Dalmans short pamphlet of twentynine pages contains so much that is fair and true whether absolutely or relatively that I hope he will give some attention to the few corrections which I shall have to make Let me now introduce the reader to the contents of his striking brochure The pamphlet was originally a lecture delivered in Berlin before a Lutheran society It was intended as a contribution to apologetics Dr Dalman says in words which deserve careful consideration Apologieen verdienen nicht den schlechten Ruf in welchem sie heutzutage bei vielen stehen Eine Religion die damit zufrieden ist dass sie existiert und keine Thaitigkeit nach aussen hin entfaltet abwehrend angreifend eroberndwitre wert vom Schauplatz abzutreten In his opening paragraphs the author laments the wonderful ignorance of Judaism which Christians display The religion which is nearest to Christianity is of all religions the most ignored and despised It seems to be thought more worth while to study the fetish faith of the Bantus than the faith of the Jews Dabei ist die Litteratur der jiidischen Religion in ihrem ganzen Umfang Christen ebenso zuganglich wie Juden Keine der nichtchrist lichen Religionen ist leichter zu studieren Wer nur eben wissen wollte was gegenwartig die Religion der deutschen Juden aller Richtungen ist konnte sogar aus deutschgeschriebenen Bilchern sich hinreichend zuver lassig unterrichten Dr Dalman then proceeds to make some valuable and penetrating remarks on Zionism whose measure he has pretty accurately taken and on antiSemitism The Jews will clearly remain in Western Europe they will neither all go to Palestine nor be driven out by force from their homes as the more violent antiSemites would desire Hence Dr Dalman thinks that there ought to be a better mutual understanding between Christian and Jew On his side he desires to show what are the specific differences between the two religions and what are the specific treasures of his own faith For the Jewish reader the occasion and object of Dr Dalmans essay are of no particular moment Its value lies in what he happens to say But it is interesting to note that Dr Dalman asks from the Jews the same candid and open pronouncements which he demands from his own side Das offene und unverhiillte Auftreten welches vom Christenthum zu fordern ist wiinschen wir aber auch vom Judenthum Auf dem Grund gegenseitiger Achtung mit Vermeidung der Hereinziehung alles personlich Verletzenden muss die Auseinandersetzung erfolgen Of course Dr Dalman as a keen Evangelical who holds that no other Church possesses fragments of truth which are wanting to his own  believes in proselytizing But it must be honourably conducted738 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Die biirgerliche Gleichberechtigung beider Parteien erscheint mir als unentbehrliche Voraussetzung fir einen ehrenhaften Kampf Der Kampf der russischen Kirche gegen das Judentum mit der Unterstiitzung einer knechtenden Gesetzgebung ihre Judenmission unter Polizeibedeckung ist in Wirklichkeit eine schmachvolle Niederlage fur das Christentum Our author deplores the fact that the Jews have produced so little literature in which Christians can find profit and enlightenment He alludes to the enormous work on the Old Testament which has been accomplished by Christian scholars during the last sixty or seventy years This work has shown according to our author it has been its Aufgabe or purpose that the history of the Old Testament culmi nates in Christ The Jews he says have produced nothing of importance or value on this subject Man sollte doch auf wissenschaftlichem Wege den Beweis fuihren dass Christus das Ende des Gesetzes nicht ist Wir warden aus solchen Arbeiten ohne Zweifel fruchtbare Belehrung schopfen und niitzliche Anregung gewinnen Wahrheit und Wesen der gSttlichen Offenbarung noch klarer zu erkennen und gegen Zweifel sicher zu stellen Von der im Traditionsglauben befangenen jiidischen Orthodoxie ist vielleicht hier wenig Erspriessliches zu erwarten Aber die jiidische Reform sollte durch derartige Arbeit mehr als bisher erweisen dass sie nicht nur aufzul6sen und niederzureissen vermag sondern auch zu sammeln und 7u bauen Here Dr Dalman is unintentionally a little unfair First of all his contention that the modern Jews have produced nothing of importance upon the Old Testament is far too sweeping Geigers Ursprung und Uebersetzungen Kalischs great Commentary on the Pentateuch and the works of Graetz Castelli Maybaum and others prove incontestably the exaggeration of Dr Dalmans statement Its measure of truth I admit and deplore Yet when our author goes on to mix up with it a complaint that the Jews have furnished no scientific proof that  Christ is not the end of the Law he seems to me to confound together two totally different things It was not the business of Kalischs Commentary on the Pentateuch to show that Christ was not the end of the Law any more than it was Dillmanns business in his commentary to show that he was The matter lies outside scientific exegesis and I must deny that it has been or is the Aufgabe  of Old Testament science to show that the history of the Old Testament does or does not  culminate in Christ in Christum mindet On the other hand a good scientific presentation of modern Judaism is I admit a desideratum Its mere negative defence is less interesting and requires constant revision For in the sense in which to orthodox Christian theologians of a hundred years ago Christ wasCRITICAL NOTICES 739 the end of the Law he is no longer the end to theologians of the modern schools In fact the kind of  end which he is supposed to have been has frequently shifted in what precise sense Dr Dalman supposes that he was the end I am not wholly sure It is at the close of p 14 that Dr Dalman proceeds to put the question on which the rest of his pamphlet depends  What are the points of value which we Christians possess in our religion beyond the Jews the defence of which is therefore our duty Was sind die Gfiter welche wir Christen in unserer Religion vor den Juden voraus haben deren Verteidigung somit uns obliegt  It is in reply to this question that our author proceeds to clear away a number of erroneous conceptions as to the relation of Judaism and Christianity to one another To begin with he discusses the frequent view that Jewish orthodoxy represents faith Jewish reform unbelief and that therefore Christianity is nearer to the former than to the latter Dr Dalmans remarks on this show fairness knowledge and a very surprising degree of accuracy I Die jiidische Reform ist keine Reformation in unserem Sinne aber ein an sich durchaus achtungswerter Versuch dem Judentum durch Befreiung desselben aus seiner gesetzlichen und formalistischen Schale eine Gestalt zu geben welche sich mit unserer von Wirkungen des Christentums durchzogenen Kulturwelt vertragt 2 Orthodoxie und Reform sind wenn auch in verschiedener Richtung von dem was uns als achter Glaube gilt gleich weit entfernt Sie nehmen deshalb zum Christentum soweit sie es kennenwas oft sehr wenig der Fall istim Wesentlichen dieselbe Stellung ein Die Achtungspradikate welche das reformerische Judentum im Einklang mit manchen Namen christen der Person Jesu gelegentlich zuerteilt verhiillen den wirklichen Thatbestand nur dem Unkundigen These quotations are full of insight Not less interesting are the remarks in which it is shown that Christianity and Judaism cannot be differentiated as New Testament and Old Testament respectively Dr Dalman holds that in neither of its two main forms is Judaism the religion of the Old Testament Die Orthodoxie basiert auf der talmudischen Tradition der nachchrist lichen Zeit und ist deshalb in vieler Beziehung jiingeren Ursprungs als das Christentum Die Reform ist oder will sein die fortgeschrittenste Gestalt der jiidischen Religion sie sieht in der mittelalterlichen Religions philosophie weiterhin im Talmudismus fruhere Phasen der Entwicklungs geschichte dieser Religion deren Ende sie ist Wie die Orthodoxie das Alte Testament nach der rabbinischen Tradition beurteilt so macht die Reform im Grunde ihr eigenes jidischreligioses Denken zum Masse des Alten Testaments Somit steht im Christentum das Neue Testament fur VOL XII 3 CTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW die Juden nicht dem Alten wohl aber der talmudischen Tradition und dem modernjiidischen Denken gegeniiber All this is perfectly accurate My only doubt is as to the sense of the word Ende  at the close of the second sentence Jewish reform does not look upon itself as the absolute and final form of Judaism and of religion That is one of the fundamental reasons why we object to the claims of orthodox Christianity There is and there can be no such thing as finality in religion An absolute religion is a human impossibility Perhaps I may just incidentally add here that the real reason why Jews will never become Christians except a few here and there is connected with this very matter From the old orthodox point of view the argument has broken down altogether Every modern commentary admits that the Jews were perfectly right in maintaining that the stock passages in Genesis in Isaiah in the Psalms do not refer to Christ Every modern commentary admits that when the Law speaks of eternal statutes it means what it says If on the other hand the Old Testament is looked at from the modern point of view the case for orthodox Christianity is far worse The Jew will not abandon the accuracy and the miracles of the Old Testament and yet accept the miracles and the accuracy of the New He may become a Unitarian he will never become a Lutheran an Anglican a Roman Catholic or any other of the many opposing exponents of orthodox Christianity But this is a digression and has nothing to do with the value and excellence of Dr Dalmans work Just as the mere contrast of Old Testament and New Testament is misleading so is it also inaccurate to describe Christianity as the religion of the other world Judaism as the religion of this world Dr Dalman points out that by the time of Jesus the doctrine of the Resurrection had become a recognized dogma of official Judaism which it has ever since remained though it is now being largely supplanted by the doctrine of the Immortality of the Soul Our author however is not quite so accurate as usual when he says Doch geht daneben her eine unverkennbare diesseitige Tendenz der religi6sen Anschauung Die Sabbathsfeier der Orthodoxie hat zu einem wesentlichen Teile ihres Inhalts irdischen Genuss Die Feier von Neujahr und Versohnungstag nach der Idee welche das altglaubige Judenthum damit verbindet starkt die Todesfurcht statt sie zu mildern oder aufzu heben Aus Besorgnis in asketische Tendenzen zu geraten vermag auch die Reform oft nicht dem Jenseits die Betonung zu geben welche nach seiner eigenen Theorie ihm zukAme Here the criticism on the observance of the Sabbath rests on a natural misapprehension If Dr Dalman will take the trouble to 740CRITICAL NOTICES 74 read Dr Schechters articles scattered through this RivmIw he will become better informed The Jewish conception of the Sabbath is particularly difficult for an outsider fully to understand The remark as to the effect of the New Year and the Day of Atonement is a great surprise to me It is certainly the very first time I ever heard of such a thing and I cannot but doubt the accuracy of the statement Any member of the faith which has sent such thousands of Jews to death should recognize that Judaism whatever errors it may contain does at least produce among its votaries a readiness for martyrdom and for death But our authors sly hit at Reform teaching is exceedingly ingenious and acute and deserves to be most seriously taken to heart by those whom it may concern Equally inaccurate says our author is the differentiation of Christianity and Judaism as the religion of Love and the religion of Hate Dr Dalmans statements on this point his clear sharp criticism of the Talmudic position his frank avowal of the great advance in universalism made by modern Judaism are all completely accurate In unserem Jahrhundert hat wenigstens unser westeuropaisches Judentum unter dem Eindrucke der humanen Zeitstromungund zwar in alien seinen Parteienden Grundsatz der allgemeinen Menschenliebe ebenso nach innen wie nach aussen proklamiert Das ist als ein bedeut samer Fortschritt anzuerkennen In diesem allgemeinen Prinzip stimmen Judentum und Christentum jetzt in der That iberein On the other hand there is an important difference observable between Judaism and Christianity in their attitude towards the out cast and the sinner To a considerable extent Dr Dalman is right I fear that he has not done me the honour to read any words of mine but if he had he would have found that two years before his lecture was published I had anticipated him on this very point As a German Dr Dalman would rub his eyes in incredulous amazement at a Jew being made honorary president of a Protestant Theological Society yet this was the position which in the year I895 I was appointed to fill in regard to the Theological Society of the University of Glasgow We do these things in Britain In my Presidential Address I ventured to ask which characteristics or qualities of the Higher Theism of today were specifically due to Judaism and which to Christianity I there said The yearning pity for the sinner and the outcast the humility of the true saver of souls who while never ceasing to accentuate the horror of sin bridges over and even annuls the moral chasm between the basest criminal and himself have been delightful characteristics of both the two great branches of Christianity in their highest and purest forms  J Q R vol VIII January I896 p 215 3 CTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Here then I agree with Dr Dalman that we have to learn from Jesus But the lesson can be learnt without believing that Jesus was God or that his body rose out of the tomb in which it had been buried Moreover and here Dr Dalman has really something new to hearthe lesson is being learnt Dr Dalman says Dem Judentum fehlt es nicht an Wohlthltigkeit auch iiber den Kreis der Volksgenossen hinaus Es hat aber nichts was den christlichen Veranstaltungen zur Rettung der Verlorenen was unserer inneren und ausseren Mission entspriche und es kann derartiges nicht haben weil es an Liebe fehlt Whether it squares with our authors theories or not this sentence is already inaccurate The necessity has arisen for these institutions and with the necessity the institutions are being founded For instance in England we have a society which is very well known to and works in harmony with Christian societies of a similar kind In England at any rate this cooperation in humanitarian work seems perfectly natural and obvious But the workers at this society who with their Christian brothers and sisters attempt to rescue the fallen and to save those who may be tottering on the brink are and intend to remain Jews It is Judaism teaching them the love of God and of man which prompts them to deeds of pity and of love and no other religious force whatever And so with similar efforts which are I believe being made in other lands Judaism is quite able to absorb the teaching of Jesus on this matter without believing any more than he himself believed in his cosub stantiality and coeternity with the divine Father It has alas become necessary to absorb it and fair critics like Dr Dalman who remind us of remediable defects are of great value in stimulating us onwards It is quite true that there was a touch of asperity in Talmudic Judaism a lack of sympathy and of love for the fallen and the outcast Our own workers in England have heard it often said We Jewish girls have less chance of retrieving ourselves after one false step because many Jewish parents are so harsh and unforgiv ing This must be changed It must again and again be impressed upon the community that such parents are far more guilty in the eyes of man and of God than their unfortunate daughters The sinner too often more sinned against than sinning must be sharply distinguished from her sin For her sin there must be hate for her a conquering and redeeming love Our author next proceeds to discuss the current descriptions of Judaism and of Christianity as the religion of works and the religion of faith He is quite well acquainted with the vulgar Jewish concep tion of Christianity as a religion the essence of which consists in 742CRITICAL NOTICES 743 a number of irrational dogmas such as the Trinity the Incarnation and Justification by Faith He well points out that the true evan gelical faith can no more remain without works than it is possible for a child who with his whole heart clings and yearns to his father not to show to that father a loyal and active obedience But when Dr Dalman says that this evangelical faith is wanting to the Jews it is really only a question of words The Jewish faith in and love of God are just as vital and just as productive of pure life and holy deeds as the Christian faith in Christ and his Father Dr Dalman would seem to imply that the Jewish attitude towards sin is rather superficial He describes it thus  The Jew knbws of divine forbearance towards human weakness and he hopes for Gods forgiveness of his sins He holds that God who created man as a sensuous being ie liable to sin must obviously selbstverstandlich be indulgent and ready to forgive Cest son metier as Heine said I am not sure that Dr Dalman has not quite correctly expressed the prevailing Jewish attitude And it seems to me quite as consonant with the divine perfection as the cumbrous theory of divine forgive ness invented by orthodox Christianity Neither of us can ever know the ways of God though haply after death we may learn whether the Jewish theory or Dr Dalmans is less remote from reality But it is curious that our usually so accurate and wellinformed author should fall into the blunder of saying that the Jew hopes to be saved  by his own reason and power Die Juden haben von der Giite der menschlichen Natur eine wie sie glauben berechtigte vorteilhaftere Meinung und sind iberzeugt dass der Mensch sich selbst zu helfen verm6ge Aus eigener Vernunft und Kraft wollen sie selig werden If this were true where would be the necessity for Gods forgiveness and indulgence  Nor is this all The Jew believes in Gods gracious help on earth  Create in us a new heart 0 Lord Lead us not into the power of sin  Subdue our inclination that it may submit itself unto thee 0 put it into our hearts to fulfil in love all the words of thy law Are these the prayers of men who hold that by their own power and reason they can be saved  This question of sin leads Dr Dalman to his final assertion that the true difference between Jews and Christians is that the latter believe in the Son of God who died for the sins of man while the former do not Nothing can be fairer than this Equally accurate is our authors incidental remark that to say that the Jews believe in a future Messiah whereas the Christians believe that he has already come obscures an essential feature For not only do many Jews no longer believe in a future Messiah at all but the Messianic age has744 THE J1EWisa QUAIcEKLY REVIEW always been more important to Judaism than the Messiahs person and individuality  The personal Messiah is no necessary element of the Jewish religion Dr Dalman makes the very odd statement that the Jews are not really able to do without a mediator after all For all Jews he says  Moses is a unique einzigartiger mediator between God and his people I cannot understand this at all It is utterly strange to me Would it be so incomprehensible and so novel if there were any truth in it  I can assure Dr Dalman that Moses is in no sense what ever the mediator between God and the Jew What Jew when he prays to his  Father in heaven  ever thinks of Moses  Why should he think of Moses Moses can neither help nor hinder the com munion of man with God I feel confident that this is not only my belief but the belief of every Jew Finally in a few candid and moderate words Dr Dalman discusses the value of Jewish Unitarianism Here I will not follow him as the subject is beyond the limits of a review But I must protest against the following Dem EinzigEinen des Judentums kann man wohl mit scheuer Ehrfurcht und mit Hingebung dienen Aber ein Verhaltniss zu ihm wie das des Kindes zum Vater ist schwer denkbar Well this is just one of those assertions that can neither be proved or disprovedon paper Those who best know Jewish life literature and history will best realize its inaccuracy Christian Unitarians as well as Jews will agree with me that one need not believe in the Incarnation or the Trinity in order to love God in order to feel towards him the relation of child to father These not easily conceivable statements are very dangerous It is not easily con ceivable that any religion which taught eternal punishment could also have taught the love of God and yet we know that the two doctrines apparently so inconsistent have often gone hand in hand Let Dr Dalman then not suppose that because we do not conceive of God as he does that therefore we do not love  our Father who is in Heaven Dr Dalman says that the argument has been used The God to whom man draws nigh without a mediator is surely the nearer and he rebuts this argument by an appeal to facts Among Christians he says those are not the most religious who place Christs position lowest And so in Judaism Jewish religious literature Jewish sermons Jewish worship give him the impression of coldness empti ness desolation That confirms his opinion the nearer to Christ the nearer to God Against a subjective impression of this kind there is nothing to be said But can the outsider accurately gaugeCRITICAL NOTICES 745 the religious feelings of others  Moreover to make religious warmth whether apparent or even real a test of religious truth seems to me a very dangerous argument A decorous congregation at a church might show less warmth than a Salvation Army Corps But does that prove that the doctrine of the Salvation Army is truer  Though I sit still and silent in synagogue I am not prepared to say that I have less religious warmth than a worshipper at an oldfashioned Cheder Or if he has more warmth I perhaps have more truth If some travellers are to be believed the most  religious people are neither Christians nor Jews By  religious  they mean religious to the eye and ear But this again is not a necessarily correct test of religious truth Even if Christianity with its human God did produce greater religious warmth than Judaism in the best sense of the word that is no convincing proof of its greater truth Jewish monotheism may conceivably need a greater religious capacity for all its height and depth to be realized Even if which I must deny it could be proved that the average man is more likely to feel God near with the belief in the Incarnation than without it I cannot see that this would be any rigid proof of the Incarnations truth God brings men and women to him in divers ways and fashions he makes use of half lights and illusions and errors Surely we must all admit that each for our own ends and from a different basis But to pursue this line of thought fascinating though it be would take too long and lead too far Meanwhile a Jewish reviewer cannot be too grateful for Dr Dalmans essay He cannot rate too highly his fairmindedness impartiality and friendly feeling I wish he would come to England and we would show him practically how Jews and Christians respect each other and how they work together in common service for humanity and for God C G

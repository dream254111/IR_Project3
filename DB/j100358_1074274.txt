FUNDAMENTAL PHENOMENA AND LAWS  2 APPLICATION INCLUDING INDUCTION COILS AND PHENOMENA TRANS FORMERS MOTORS AND DYNAMOS TELEPHONES ETC CLASS WORK THE CLASS WORK SHOULD CONSIST OF RECITATIONS FROM THE TEXT BOOK ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE PRINCIPAL PHENOMENA BY THE INSTRUCTOR AND THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS BY THE STUDENT THE LATTER IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS THE STUDENT OFTEN LEARNS DEFINITIONS AND FORMULAE WITHOUT APPRECIATING THEIR MEANING THE CLASS SHOULD OCCASIONALLY BE GIVEN WRITTEN REVIEWS OR EXAMINATIONS THE QUESTIONS USED IN SUCH EXAMINATIONS SHOULD BE CAREFULLY THOUGHT OUT AND EXPRESSED IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY BECOME A TEST OF THE STUDENTS REASONING POWERS RATHER THAN A TEST OF MEMORY THE DISCIPLINE DERIVED FROM THE CLEAR AND CONCISE STATEMENT IN WRITING OF FACTS AND THE LOGICAL DEDUCTIONS THEREFROM IS EXTREMELY VAL UABLE THE WRITTEN REVIEW BRINGS OUT THE RELATIVE PROGRESS OF THE 3THE SCHOOL REVIEW INDIVIDUALS AND OFTEN SHOWS THAT THE CLASS AS A WHOLE HAS FAILED TO GRASP SOME IMPORTANT FACT THE PAPERS ARE TO BE CORRECTED AND RETURNED TO THE STUDENT AND IT IS WELL TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE CLASS TO THE MORE COMMON ERRORS DETECTED IN THE ANSWERS EXPERIMENTAL WORK THE RESULTS SOUGHT IN EXPERIMENTAL WORK MAY BE CLASSED AS FOLLOWS I METHODS OF OBSERVATION AND THE DEDUCTION OF LAWS FROM THE RESULTS OF OBSERVATION 2 EMPHASIZING AND FIXING IMPORTANT LAWS AND FACTS IN THE MIND OF THE STUDENT 3 SKILL IN MANIPULATION OR HANDLING OF APPARATUS 4 THE PROPER TABULATION OF EXPERIMENTAL DATA AND RESULTS THE LABORATORY WORK SHOULD BE CAREFULLY ARRANGED AND THE VALUE OF EACH EXPERIMENT CONSIDERED IN RELATION TO EACH OF THE RESULTS SOUGHT THE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS MAY VARY FROM FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED DEPENDING UPON THE TIME ALLOWED FOR EACH A CONVENIENT METHOD CONSISTS IN ARRANGING EACH EXPERIMENT TO OCCUPY ONE COMPLETE LABORATORY PERIOD THIS SYSTEM PERMITS OF THE MOST ECONOMICAL USE OF THE APPARATUS AND THE STUDENTS TIME THE EXPERIMENTS SHOULD BE QUANTITATIVE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND A DEGREE OF ACCURACY ATTAINABLE SUCH THAT THE STUDENT MAY NOT LOSE FAITH IN EXPERIMENTAL WORK GREAT STRESS SHOULD BE LAID UPON QUALITY RATHER THAN QUANTITY OF WORK AND CAREFUL ACCURATE WORK ENCOURAGED LABORATORY INSTRUCTIONWHILE GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS AND THE DISCUSSION OF RESULTS MAY BE TAKEN UP BY THE CLASS AS A WHOLE THE GREATER PART OF THE LABORATORY INSTRUCTION IS NECESSARILY WITH THE INDIVIDUAL AND NO INSTRUCTOR SHOULD HAVE MORE STUDENTS IN THE LABORATORY AT ONE TIME THAN HE CAN PROPERLY CARE FOR STUDENTS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH A BLANK IN DUPLICATE WHICH CONTAINS A PLACE FOR EACH OBSERVED OR CONSTANT QUANTITY NEEDED IN COMPUTING THE RESULT THESE ARE FILLED OUT AS THE WORK PRO GRESSES AND AT THE END OF THE PERIOD ONE COPY IS HANDED TO THE INSTRUCTOR THE OTHER TOGETHER WITH A SKETCH OF THE APPARATUS AND METHOD FORM THE STUDENTS LABORATORY NOTES 32OUTLINE OF A COURSE IN GENERAL PHYSICS RECORD OF EXPERIMENTSTHE FINAL RECORD OF EACH EXPERIMENT SHOULD BE NEATLY WRITTEN UP FROM THE STUDENTS LABORATORY NOTES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AFTER THE EXPERIMENT IS PERFORMED AND SHOULD STATE CLEARLY A THE PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED B THE METHOD C THE OBSERVED AND COMPUTED RESULTS THE SKETCHES NECESSARY SHOULD BE CONFINED TO SIMPLE DIAGRAMS MADE WITH AN ORDINARY RULING PEN AND COMPASSES SHADED OR PERSPECTIVE DRAWINGS ARE NOT TO BE PERMITTED THE TABULATION OF OBSERVED AND COMPUTED RESULTS SHOULD BE SUCH THAT THEY MAY BE READILY COMPARED WHENEVER POSSIBLE THE RESULTS SHOULD BE PLOTTED IN THE FORM OF CURVES THE PAPER RECOMMENDED IS A MEDIUM WEIGHT LINEN LEDGER PAPER CUT IN SHEETS 8 X IO INCHES CROSSRULED ON BOTH SIDES AND PUNCHED WITH TWO HOLES ONEHALF INCH FROM THE LONGER EDGE THE SHEETS ARE AFTERWARDS BOUND IN COVERS PUNCHED TO CORRESPOND THE RULING SHOULD BE SPACED SIX LINES TO THE INCH WHICH IS CON VENIENT FOR WRITING TABULATION AND CURVE PLOTTING TEN LINES TO THE INCH OR FIVE TO THE CENTIMETER WOULD BE BETTER BUT PAPER WITH LINES CLOSER THAN SIX TO THE INCH IS PRINTED FROM PLATES IS EXPENSIVE AND DOES ROT TAKE INK WELL ON THE PRINTED LINES LABORATORY MANUALMOST OF THE TEXTBOOKS AND LABORATORY MANUALS DESIGNED FOR AN ACADEMIC COURSE IN PHYSICS ARE TOO ELEMENTARY IN CHARACTER THE RECENT TEXTBOOKS HOWEVER ARE SOMEWHAT MORE ADVANCED AND CONTAIN MANY EXPERIMENTS SUITABLE FOR THE LABORATORY WORK IN MANY RESPECTS THE COMBINED TEXT BOOK AND LABORATORY MANUAL IS PREFERABLE HOWEVER THE INSTRUC TOR SHOULD EXERCISE JUDGMENT IN THE SELECTION OF THE EXERCISES TO BE PERFORMED BY THE STUDENT IN THE LABORATORY FOR EXAMPLE THE HEATING OF A WIRE BY AN ELECTRIC CURRENT IS AN EXPERIMENT TO BE PERFORMED BEFORE THE CLASS BY THE INSTRUCTOR AS AN ILLUSTRATION WHILE THE MEASUREMENT OF THE POWER ABSORBED BY AN INCANDES CENT LAMP IS AN EXCELLENT EXPERIMENT FOR THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT NO SCHOOL SHOULD UNDERTAKE TO GIVE INSTRUCTION IN PHYSICS WITHOUT A TEACHER WELL TRAINED IN EXPERIMENTAL METHODS AND A SUITABLY EQUIPPED LABORATORY 33THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE INSTRUCTOR SHOULD ALSO HAVE AT HIS DISPOSAL SOME SIMPLE BUT EFFECTIVE DEVICE FOR ILLUSTRATING IN THE CLASS ROOM EVERY IMPORTANT LAW OR PHENOMENA AS IT IS TAKEN UP A SUCCESSFUL INSTRUCTOR WILL ADAPT MANY COMMON AND INEXPENSIVE ARTICLES OF TRADE IN DEVISING CLASS ROOM ILLUSTRATIONS AND LABORATORY EXPERI MENTS THE LIST OF APPARATUS FOR CLASS DEMONSTRATIONS SHOULD HOWEVER CONTAIN THE FOLLOWING PIECES OF GOOD QUALITY A PROJECTING LANTERN WITH VERTICAL SPECTROSCOPE AND POLAR SCOPE ATTACHMENTS AN ADJUSTABLE WINDOW MIRROR FOR PROJECTING WITH SUNLIGHT AN AIR PUMP INDUCTION COIL LARGE ELECTROMAGNET AND A SOURCE OF CURRENT SIX STORAGE CELLS CHARGED BY A PRIMARY BATTERY OR FROM THE STREET MAIN FORM AN ADMIRABLE SOURCE OF CURRENT FOR ALL CLASS AND LABORATORY WORK THE LABORATORY EQUIPMENT IS ALSO LARGELY COMPOSED OF INEX PENSIVE APPARATUS FOR DEFINITE EXPERIMENTS BUT IN ADDITION IT SHOULD CONTAIN A GOOD BALANCE WITH A SENSIBILITY OF O5 M G AND A CAPACITY OF IOO GRAMS A SET OF STANDARD WEIGHTS A PEN DULUM VIBRATING SECONDS THIS NEED NOT BE A CLOCK A FREE PEN DULUM WITH MERCURY CONTACT WILL ANSWER A STANDARD OF LENGTH MERCURIAL BAROMETER A GOOD THERMOMETER PAIR OF SIMPLE MEAS URING MICROSCOPES PAIR OF TELESCOPES OF ONE INCH APERTURE SPEC TROMETER GALVANOMETER OF HIGH SENSIBILITY AND A SET OF STANDARD RESISTANCES NO EQUIPMENT IS COMPLETE WITHOUT A WORK ROOM FITTED WITH A SMALL SCREWCUTTING LATHE AND LATHE TOOLS VISE ARID BENCH TOOLS A FEW WOODWORKING TOOLS AND A SUPPLY OF MATERIALS SUCH AS SHEET METALS WIRE RODS HARD RUBBER WOOD NAILS SCREWS BINDING POSTS ETC THIS PART OF THE EQUIPMENT IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE INSTRUC TOR IN GETTING UP CLASS ILLUSTRATIONS AND LABORATORY APPARATUS THE CLASS OFTEN CONTAINS A FEW STUDENTS WITH CONSIDERABLE TASTE AND SKILL IN THE USE OF TOOLS AND THE INSTRUCTOR USUALLY FINDS THEM WILLING ASSISTANTS TO SUCH STUDENTS THE CONSTRUCTION OF SIMPLE APPARATUS IS A SOURCE OF GREAT BENEFIT AND DELIGHT 34

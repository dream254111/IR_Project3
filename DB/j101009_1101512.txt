Georgia R B  Banking Co v Maddox Ga 42 S E 315 it was held that the operation of a railroad terminal yard located and operated by legislative authority and conducted in a proper manner cannot be enjoined as a nuisance by neighboring property owners though the operating of the yara seriously intaxteres Niri dlie CGflfoi ai cia iAg rit by reason of the noise vibration smoke and cinders The c 6nt said iI part  From what we have said above it is seen that the terminal yard the opera tion of which the defendants in error seek to enjoin was located and its con struction authorized under statutory powers In such cases the general rule supported practically by an almost unbroken line of authorities is that a work so located and constructed if constructed and operated in a proper manner can not be adjudged a nuisance This applies with special force to works thus authorized to facilitate transportation on railroads which are of a quasi public nature 19 Am  Eng Ene Law lst ed 923 924

may be a nuisance to owners and residents of abutting property like other cases of lawful business not partaking of a public nature and not having legislative sanction See Sawyer v Davis Mass 49 Am Rep 27 Bomer v Railroad Co Minn 77 N W 825 74 Am St Rep 455 To make such rules uncertain is to invite a mass of litigation and clog the wheels of commerce  The contention of the defendants in error that this terminal yard of switches and side tracks is a nuisance at Inman Park because dwellings were erected there before the construction of the yard and it could have been located at an other point where there were no residences without being a nuisance to anyone is without modern legal precedent to sustain it and is unsound for at least two reasons In the first place the terminal yard was located at the terminus of one railroad on an existing right of way of another railroad and under statu tory power We have adverted in paragraph 1 of this opinion to the power of the Atlanta Belt Line Company to locate its eastern terminus on the Georgia Railroad at or near Inman Park and to the defendants in error being remediless to change that location after the work was completed even if they had any right to stop the work at all We also referred to the power of that railroad company to acquire by lease land for its necessary facilities at such eastern terminus It had the power to put in all the side tracks it needed and side tracks cannot be put in without switches A power to build side tracks is essential to the purpose and use of the road A power to build a railroad of a single track without the means of passing the trains or of leaving the track for the shifting of cars and without standing room for the cars not in motion would be clearly wanting in all that is necessary to safety convenience and utility and would be vain and nugatory    A switch is but a mechanical contrivance or movable opening to pass cars from one track to another The spot where the openings in the main track should be placed falls within the absolute discretion of the company and cannot be readjudged by a private citizen who lives along the line of the road Railroad Co v Speer 56 Pa 325 94 Am Dec 84 In the second place it is obvious if the terminal yard is a nuisance because located near dwellings that it would clearly be a nuisance wherever it might be put even in the woods or in a field as soon as the owners of the adjacent land built houses on their land  for the old rule maintained by some authorities that coming to a nuisance will prevent a person so coming from making any complaint has long since been exploded 16 Am  Eng Ene Law lst Ed 934 Railroad Co v Woodruff 86 Ga 94 13 S E 156 3 People v Detroit White Lead Works Mich 46 N W 735 9 L R A 722 2 Wood Nuis see 574  While the rule above stated is undoubtedly correct in view of the authori ties it does not follow that railroad works authorized by statute cannot become nuisances by their improper construction or by their negligent and improper use after a proper construction 2 Wood Nuis 761 19 Am  Eng Ene Law lst ed  925  4 Wait Act  Def p 785 The reason is that such exceptions do not fall within the legislative

please without any consideration for and to the great detriment of the rights and property of others Some of the instances under which it is generally held that a nuisance may arise from the improper conduct of a railroad work authorized by statute and which points are involved in this case are 1 Using defective engines which scatter unnecessary quantities of sparks cinders and smoke Austin v Railway Co 8upra 2 the improper management of proper locomotives by using a greater amount of steam than is reasonably necessary by which an unusually large number of sparks are emitted in attempting to draw tod heavy a load up grade 3 Elliott R R sec 12225 3 the sounding of whistles ringing of bells and blowing off of steam at im proper times and in an unnecessary manner Austin v Railway Co supra 4 the running of trains or cars or using locomotives on Sundays by which churches are rendered less valuable for the purposes to which they are devoted and divine worship therein on such days is

a tunnel underneath it The defendant pleaded damnum absque injuria and that no right of recovery existed unless the power delegated had been illegally or negli gently exercised The court however by Alvey C J overruled the conten tion distinguishing the rights and liabilities of a municipal corporation in the careful exercise of its right and power to grade change and improve its streets from those of a private corporation in no wise connected with the municipal government and asserting the right to use the streets in an extraordinary man ner for its own private purposes and profit Said the court  Notwithstanding authority may have been obtained both from the city and State legislatures to make the extraordinary use of the street yet that authority must be exercised at the peril of the party to whom it is delegated and if any injury accrues to private property in the exercise of the power the party pro ducing it must be held liable See also Garrett v Lake Roland E B Co 79 Md 277 24 L R A 396 Morton v Mayor 140 N Y 207 22 L R A 241 The rights of the abutting owners in such case doubtless depend in large measure on the phraseology of the constitutional provision regulating the taking of private property for public use Where taking or damaging is prohibited without just compensation it would seem that the ruling in the principal case cannot be sustained Section 58 of the new Constitution of Vir ginia provides that the General Assembly  shall not enact any law whereby private property shall be taken or damaged for public uses without just com pensation Quaere Is this equivalent in legal effect to a provision that such property shall not be so taken or damaged

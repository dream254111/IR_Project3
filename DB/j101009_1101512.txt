REP 27 BOMER V RAILROAD CO MINN 77 N W 825 74 AM ST REP 455 TO MAKE SUCH RULES UNCERTAIN IS TO INVITE A MASS OF LITIGATION AND CLOG THE WHEELS OF COMMERCE  THE CONTENTION OF THE DEFENDANTS IN ERROR THAT THIS TERMINAL YARD OF SWITCHES AND SIDE TRACKS IS A NUISANCE AT INMAN PARK BECAUSE DWELLINGS WERE ERECTED THERE BEFORE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE YARD AND IT COULD HAVE BEEN LOCATED AT AN OTHER POINT WHERE THERE WERE NO RESIDENCES WITHOUT BEING A NUISANCE TO ANYONE IS WITHOUT MODERN LEGAL PRECEDENT TO SUSTAIN IT AND IS UNSOUND FOR AT LEAST TWO REASONS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE TERMINAL YARD WAS LOCATED AT THE TERMINUS OF ONE RAILROAD ON AN EXISTING RIGHT OF WAY OF ANOTHER RAILROAD AND UNDER STATU TORY POWER WE HAVE ADVERTED IN PARAGRAPH 1 OF THIS OPINION TO THE POWER OF THE ATLANTA BELT LINE COMPANY TO LOCATE ITS EASTERN TERMINUS ON THE GEORGIA RAILROAD AT OR NEAR INMAN PARK AND TO THE DEFENDANTS IN ERROR BEING REMEDILESS TO CHANGE THAT LOCATION AFTER THE WORK WAS COMPLETED EVEN IF THEY HAD ANY RIGHT TO STOP THE WORK AT ALL WE ALSO REFERRED TO THE POWER OF THAT RAILROAD COMPANY TO ACQUIRE BY LEASE LAND FOR ITS NECESSARY FACILITIES AT SUCH EASTERN TERMINUS IT HAD THE POWER TO PUT IN ALL THE SIDE TRACKS IT NEEDED AND SIDE TRACKS CANNOT BE PUT IN WITHOUT SWITCHES A POWER TO BUILD SIDE TRACKS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE PURPOSE AND USE OF THE ROAD A POWER TO BUILD A RAILROAD OF A SINGLE TRACK WITHOUT THE MEANS OF PASSING THE TRAINS OR OF LEAVING THE TRACK FOR THE SHIFTING OF CARS AND WITHOUT STANDING ROOM FOR THE CARS NOT IN MOTION WOULD BE CLEARLY WANTING IN ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO SAFETY CONVENIENCE AND UTILITY AND WOULD BE VAIN AND NUGATORY    A SWITCH IS BUT A MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCE OR MOVABLE OPENING TO PASS CARS FROM ONE TRACK TO ANOTHER THE SPOT WHERE THE OPENINGS IN THE MAIN TRACK SHOULD BE PLACED FALLS WITHIN THE ABSOLUTE DISCRETION OF THE COMPANY AND CANNOT BE READJUDGED BY A PRIVATE CITIZEN WHO LIVES ALONG THE LINE OF THE ROAD RAILROAD CO V SPEER 56 PA 325 94 AM DEC 84 IN THE SECOND PLACE IT IS OBVIOUS IF THE TERMINAL YARD IS A NUISANCE BECAUSE LOCATED NEAR DWELLINGS THAT IT WOULD CLEARLY BE A NUISANCE WHEREVER IT MIGHT BE PUT EVEN IN THE WOODS OR IN A FIELD

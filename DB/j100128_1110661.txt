involved depends peculiarly upon the law or policy of the domicile of the corporation20 MUTUALITY IN THE SPECIFIC ENFORCEMENT OF CONTRACTS OF OPTION The obscurity which has enveloped the doctrine of mutuality in specific performance though in large part dissipated by the researches of two learned writers1 is still the cause of considerable confusion of thought The classic statement of the rule is The contract must as a general rule be mutual that is such that it might at the time it was entered into have been enforced by either of the parties against the other2 But this imperfect generalization is subject to many ex ceptions Thus the fact that the plaintiff an adult was an infant at the inception of the contract3 or that he failed to sign the memo randum required by the Statute of Frauds4 or that he was unable to make a good title at the date of the contract or the filing of the suit5 constitutes no defense to a bill for specific performance These ex ceptions are referable to the principle that the only mutuality required is that of the remedy at the time of the decree And mutuality has been more accurately defined to mean that equity will not compel specific performance by a defendant if after performance the com mon law remedy of damages would be his sole security for the per formance of the plaintiffs side of the contract6 But the generally discarded idea that mutuality of obligation as well as of remedy is required still persists in some jurisdictions where specific perform ance of contracts of option for the sale of land is refused on the ground that the optionee is under no reciprocal duty to accept the option7 An option contemplates either a bilateral or a unilateral contract From an option of the first class a distinct bilateral contract arises upon the optionees notice of acceptance8 if it be of the second class a tender of the purchase price gives to the optionor the complete quid pro quo for his promise In the latter case the plaintiff has acquired a position identical with that of a party to a bilateral con tract who has fuly performed hence in either event no effective defense can be interposed to the bill A more difficult question arises where the optionor has endeavored to revoke the option during its life If the option is but a contract to hold open an offer its breach See Babcock v Farwell I9Io 245 Ill 14

in holding an option on valuable considera tion to be an irrevocable offer10 and that an acceptance within the life of the option creates a specifically enforcible contract despite the attempted retraction And since in strict theory equity is enforcing a new contract rather than the option it does not inquire into the adequacy of the consideration for the latter12 On the other hand there is a sharp division of authority on the question of the specific enforcement of options under seal depending in part upon the different values accorded the seal in various jurisdictions It is held by some courts that the seal estops the optionor to deny the payment of con sideration13 while in other jurisdictions the seal is either held to be only prima facie evidence of consideration4 or is holly dis regarded5 And it seems that the last view is the only sound one since equity usually denies its remedies to a covenantee who has given no actual considerationl0 Upon the principles above discussed the doctrine of mutuality seems clearly inapplicable to ordinary unilateral contracts Yet in a few jurisdictions a stubborn adherence to the antiquated formula of mutu ality has permitted this defense against a plaintiff who has already supplied the consideration for the defendants promise17 The ques tion was raised in a recent Michigan case Howe v Benedict 1913 142 N W 768 in which a testatrix had offered to devise land to the plaintiff if he would care for her until her death The plaintiff had fulfilled the terms of the offer and although the plaintiff had assumed no obligation to perform specific performance was granted him against the devisee Want of mutuality of obligation more frequently prevails as a defense to a bill for specific performance or injunction if the plaintiffs option is negative that is where he may terminate the contract after notice to the defendant8 This result is more easily reached on the 9Ashley Contracts  13 Page Contracts  35 I California Law Rev 222 Even under this view it would seem that an injunction might lie to restrain the breach of the contract Adams v Peabody Coal Co 1907 230 Ill 469 Bradford v Foster 1888 87 Tenn 4 This legal paradox may be explained upon the ground that an option is practically valueless commercially if the optionee is limited to a suit at law for the withdrawal of the offer Watts v Kellar C C A I893 56 Fed I Guyer v

mutuality of remedy through which this result is sometimes reached Marble Co v Ripley 1870 o1 Wall 339 359 738ground of equitys refusal to decree a vain thing since the plaintiff might render its order nugatory at will19 The trend of the later cases however is towards the acceptance of a more reasonable view that if the contract is equitable the plaintiff should be given the relief de manded on the principle that his appeal to chancery is a guaranty of his willingness to perform0 INSURABLE INTEREST IN FIRE AND LIFE POLICIESThere is no little confusion in the books over the determination of the question as to the extent of the interest which the assured must have in the subject matter of the contract of insurance in order to purge the transaction of the taint of wager and speculation The question has recently arisen in the case of Oatman v B  M Mut Fire Relief Assn Ore 1913 133 Pac 1183 The court held that a husband who had insured his wifes property in which he had no rights could not recover from the insurer when the property was destroyed The decision is consist ent with the better view of the law inasmuch as in cases of ordinary fire and marine policies the engagement of the insurer is merely to indemnify the proof of the loss being a condition precedent to recov ery on the contract1 It does not follow however that since there must be interest at the time of the happening of the event against which the policy insures that in absence of a stipulation to such effect in the policy2 the contract is invalid if the insured has no interest in the property at the time the contract was made3 Some of the authorities refuse to sanction this rule not only on the ground that it would be a wager contract to insure against loss from the destruction of prop erty in which there were no present interest but also because it would present a strong temptation to destroy the res and therefore against public policy4 But these arguments are not sound when it is remem bered that the assured cannot enforce the contract unless he shows that he had acquired an interest in the property before its destruction for otherwise he has suffered no loss The cases are no more harmonious in stating how great the interest at the time of the accident must be to warrant a recovery While the Rust v Conrad I882 47 Mich 449 Ulrey v Keith Ig98 237 III 284 Phila Ball Club v Laioe

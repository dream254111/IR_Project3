j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1449844,Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles,i263145,336 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW but Dr Kraushar does not attach much value to the account of Frank given by this historian He taxes him with ignorance of the Polish sources He frequently commits solecisms in the citation of Polish names Moreover he lacks the proper objective spirit of the historian as shown in the abuse which he continually heaps upon Frank These remarks apply not only to the mention of Frank in the Geschichte der Juden but also to the work of Graetz entitled Frank und die Frankisten  868 W R MORFILL MEDIAEVAL JEWISH CHRONICLES MediaevalJewish Chronicles and Chronological Notes ed by A NEUBAUER Oxford Clarendon Press I887I895 Parts III DR NEUBAUERS unabated zeal in his useful labours in the field of Hebrew Literature which he successfully continues in spite of physical suffering has enabled him to complete the collection of Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles the first instalment of which appeared in 1887 Students of Jewish History and Hebrew Literature must welcome the work as a valuable treasure that contains a rich supply of desirable information It is owing to Dr Neubauers genius and inexhaustible store of knowledge in addition to the opportunities which all have who live in an institution like the Bodleian Library that the collection is as complete and as perfect as possible The numerous various readings from different manuscripts and editions contained in the footnotes and the many supplementary extracts from different works give evidence of the immehse labour bestowed on this work by the editor How conscientiously Dr Neubauer works and what difficulties the deciphering of the MSS frequently illegible involves can best be seen by the Additions and Corrections of pp 252 to 255 Each volume contains a brief literary account of the various treatises it includes and at the end of the second volume a complete Index for the whole work has been added In these two volumes Dr Neubauer includes thirteen different treatises seven of which are edited here for the first time We will consider them seriatim Part II p 3 Megillathtaanith Scroll of Fasting deserves the first place as the oldest of these Chronicles It contains two different elements the original scroll in Aramaic and the Commentary on it in Hebrew of a much later date The title is apparently chosen after the manner of lucus a non lucendo for the scroll enumerates only the days on which fasting may not take place Such a name isCRITICAL NOTICES 337 a strange phenomenon in Hebrew literature only on account of euphemy we meet with the title toharoth Purities instead of  Im purities semahoth Rejoicings instead of Mourning In the title Scroll of Fasting we have just the reverse of euphemy I therefore beg to differ from Dr Neubauer who calls the Appendix containing a list of fastdays  a later addition  it is more probable that this list including perhaps later interpolations formed an essential part in the original plan This theory is confirmed by the following passage  Who wrote the Scroll of Fasting  The school of Rabbi Eliezer son of Hananiah son of Hizkiah son of Gorion Why did they write it   i e why did they commemorate the various events and why do we not do the same  Because they were not accustomed to troubles i e when troubles came it was a memorable event but we are accustomed to them they are an everydays occurrence The troubles tsaroth are the principal subject of the megillah and not the deliverance the cause of not fasting on certain days The reading of the Talmud favours still more this theory  They wrote it because they loved the troubles scil as opportunities for evincing their cheerful submission to the will of God comp Tainm B Berachoth 5b whereupon R Jochanan We also love them but they are too many to be written down To the variae lectiones contained in the notes I should like to add an important one p I2 the word adrachta occurs according to the Amst edition of 171I and the MSS consulted by the editor Adrachta signifies warrant for distress which is entirely out of question here The correct reading is found in the edition Jacob Emden and in the Talmud viz adcharta the name of God Part II p 26 Seder Olam a Chronology from Adam to BenCosiba i e Bar Cochba The book may be divided into two unequal parts the Biblical and Postbiblical Chronology the latter begins with the commencement of the Era of the Greeks minyan Yevanim The transition from the one part to the other is formed by the following sentence Up to here we have the authority of the prophets who were inspired with the holy spirit as regards that which follows incline thine ear and listen to the words of the Sages The Era of the Greeks was according to the Seder Olam common among the Jews in the diaspora in all legal documents shetaroth but in other respects he suggests to count the years from the destruction of the Temple It is remarkable that whilst the author gives full details of the history of the destruction of the first Temple and of the events narrated in the books of Ezekiel Daniel Esther Ezra and Nehemiah he contents himself with giving a bare outline of the chronology of the second Temple and does not mention any details of the history of338 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the Maccabees or of the Roman period The dates and facts which are given of the postbiblical time are those which occur in the Talmud in the name of Rabbi Jose in the very same expressions It is therefore to this Tanna Rabbi Jose that tradition assigns the authorship of the Seder Olam 2 There is nothing in the book that contradicts this tradition Three different dates of a later period are found in the text Iooo Sel era printed ed 782 after the destruc tion of the second Temple MS Opp 317 and I I7 Sel MS Halberstamm As these dates have no reference whatever to the text they are later additions by copyists who wanted to illustrate the text by the date of their own times Succeeding copyists treated these additions as integral parts of the text The book contains thirty chapters divided into three sections the first two are called baba kamma first section baba metsiatha the middle section but the name for the last section which would accordingly be baba bathra is not found in any of the editions or manuscripts collated by Neubauer Of these thirty chapters two are identical namely ch V and ch XXI the variations in the text are insignificant and not one of them essential It is strange that in the ed Neubauer the first of these chapters is introduced as baba tinyana second part The Amsterdam edition has this chap ter only once On the whole we find that the variations registered in the notes or added in the text are not essential they are mostly clerical errors and the reader will easily distinguish the reading which is that of the author from the errors of the copyists Two instances may suffice p 27 According to one text Rebecca was three according to another four and according to a third reading fourteen years old when married to Isaac From the clear statement in the text that Isaac was thirtyseven years old when laid upon the altar that at the same time Sarah died and Rebecca was born it follows that Rebecca was three years old when Isaac forty years old married her The number three is the correct number the numbers fourteen or four may have the authority of a certain tradi tion3 but are out of place here p 42 The Israelites commenced to count the years of shemitah and jubilee fourteen years after their entry into the land of Canaan for 850 years they dwelt in the land that is seventeen complete jubilees and so we read in Ezekiel xl I in the beginning of the year on the tenth of the month in the fourteenth year after the fall of the city how then was it that 1 Comp Babyl T Shabbath p 15 a Abodah Zarah 9 a 2 Comp Tanya de Seder Olam Rabba in the Postscript p 67 s Comp Rashi on Gen xxv 26CRITICAL NOTICES 339 a Jubilee year was fourteen years later Because they commenced to count fourteen years after the entry The number fourteen as in the Amsterdam edition is the only correct number the number which the Neubauer edition has according to MS Opp 317 is decidedly wrong Dr Neubauer describes the printed edition as HispanicoEastern text and traces the text of MS Opp 317 to the FrancoGermanic school But on examining the variations in the two texts I am unable to discover any instance that could be con sidered as characteristic of a particular school Noteworthy is the authors interpretation of Isaiah xix I9 when Sennacheribs army was destroyed before Jerusalem there were left his captives from Egypt and other countries these fell into the hands of Hezekiah and set at liberty by him they returned home as true worshippers of God and built the altar to the Lord in the land of Egypt This Seder Olam as the larger one rabba is followed p 68 by a smaller one Seder Olam Zuta It contains the names and dates of the generations from Adam to king Jehoiakim with the names of the high priests and prophets of each generation from king David to the destruction of the Temple by the Babylonians thirtynine generations are then enumerated from the last king of Judah to Mar Zutra the names given are the heads of the exile and the Sages that guided them It was probably compiled in the eighth century and was intended to establish the Davidic descent of the Heads of the Exiles rashegolah No variae lectiones accompany the text but instead two different texts are added the text of the Yohasin headed The family of the Head of the Exile in Babylon and A Chronicle from Adam to the Gaon Saadia according to the first edition of the Yohasin They contain varied and valuable information concerning the Babylonian schools of Sura and Pum boditha There is one interesting event mentioned briefly in Seder Olam Zuta p 73 namely that Mar Zutra after a successful war against the Persians established in Babylon a Jewish independent State which however again lost its independence after seven years It would have been interesting to find in some of the various texts some more details of the history of the Jewish State during this short period But if Dr Neubauer could not discover anything more about it we may fairly assume that nothing more is extant Two other treatises named Seder Olamn are included in the first part of this Collection pp I6I and 176 One of these written by Yerah meel in the eleventh century contains the history of the Tradition the names of the high priests of both Temples the history of the Jews during the second Temple and an outline of Talmud and Bible The other the full title of which is Seder Olam Zuta veseder TenaimTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW veemnoraim is described by Dr Neubauer I xxi note 4 as epitomized from the Seder Olam Zuta and Rabba and Seder Tenaim veemoraim it was finished on the 15th of Ellul 1044 by the same author Part I p 3 A letter of the Gaon Sherira Iggereth Rabbenu Sherira Gaon Questions were addressed by R Jacob b Nissim of Kairowan concerning the composition of the Mishnah the Talmud the Tcsefta the Sifra and the Sifre and the chronology of the Saburaeans and of the Geonim The author fully discusses all the questions addressed to him Enumerating these problems Part I p viii Dr Neubauer says And chiefly whether the Mishnah was orally transmitted to the doctors of the Talmud or if it was written down by the compiler himself adding in surprise an advanced question for such an early period Our surprise however is gone as soon as we formulate the question more in accordance with the text Did Rabbi compile the Mishnah from written documents or from oral communications  The question whether Rabbi wrote down the Mishnah which he compiled or whether the Mishnah was transmitted orally for some time after Rabbi is likewise discussed in this letter But we must leave the further consideration of this problem and other problems connected with this letter and with the Sefer hakkabbalah of R Abraham b David for another occasion We only add that the valuable notes extracts and fragments added by the editor will be of great help to the historian who will attempt to find his way through the labyrinth of names and dates contained in these historical documents A con tinuation of the Sefer hakkabbalah by R Abraham b Shelomoh is included in the Chronicles of Part I p IOI edited from a MS in the Bodleian Library Part II p 89 An Arabic chronicle from the creation to 1159 edited for the first time from two MSS in the Bodleian Library has especial interest for the rendering of the geographical names in the Bible According to the editor the anonymous author mostly agrees with the Gaon Saadia in his Commentaries and he considers it possible that the author made use of a chronological treatise of the Gaon mentioned in Judah b Bileams Commentary on the first prophets Part II p xi The Chronicle is divided into seven chapters The first five chapters contain the Biblical history of the Israelites according to the Bible with Midrashic interpretation now and then whilst the last two chapters are devoted to the chronology of the Postbiblical history up to 1159 Part I p 85 Another Chronicle from the creation to 1467 edited from a Bodleian MS forms the fiftieth chapter of Zecher Tsaddik a ritual work written by Joseph b Tsaddik of Arevalo in Spain  It is probable that Joseph b Tsaddik and Abraham Zakkuth in his 340CRITICAL NOTICES 34I Yohasin made use of one and the same chronicle which both con tinued up to their time  Part I p xiv Of great importance for the study of the history of the Jews in the Middle Ages especially of the Jews in the East are the extracts from the historical work Dibre Joseph by R Joseph b Yitshak Sambary which was finished in Alexandria The importance of the work may be inferred from the fact that Dr A Berliner had it reprinted in a small edition as the first volume of his Quellenschriften zur jiidischen Geschichte u Literatur It is perhaps to be regretted that Dr Neubauer chose to give only extracts instead of editing the complete work passages not interesting to A may be welcomed by B as important information As a rule however the editor of these chronicles has a sound judg ment on such matters The reader will find in these extracts interesting and amusing tales about the Jews in Egypt about Abraham Ibn Ezra Maimonides David Alroy c The book concludes with the complaint and the hope which are not un common in the present age After them ie the learned men mentioned before the study of the Torah decreased in the present generation may the Lord send Messiah and may be fulfilled the word  and all thy children shall be taught of the Lord Part II p III Sefer Yohasin The Book of Genealogy is a family chronicle written by Ahimaaz with a postscript giving briefly the names and dates of the successive generations by Menahem son of R Benjamin in the year I055 Incidentally it contains also information about the Jews in the South of Italy about the invasion of the Saracens in the year 872 and the like An amusing tale is told about R Silano the interpreter Meturgeman of the Haham of the congregation who had recently come from Palestine to that place There was once a riot in the streets which R Silano described in a few rhymes He then got hold of the lecture prepared by the Haham for next Sabbath erased a line or two and inserted his rhymes The poor lecturer was puzzled and hesitatingly read the rhymes R Silano at once interpreted them as referring to the riot which had taken place the previous day Silano was excommunicated but through the interference of R Ahimaaz the herem was cancelled The book is edited from a unique MS preserved in the Cathedral Library of Madrid I doubt whether the MS is the original copy of the author there are errors that can only come from a thoughtless copyist eg p 1151 1 I9 D i i r nW mvn 1 ri

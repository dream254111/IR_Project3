found that putting the amount of red light perceived by myself as 100 he perceived only 6304 per cent It was also ascertained that his vision was not only defective for red light but to a less extent for green he perceiving only 855 per cent of it A set of control ex periments were then made on Mr T The blue glass was replaced by the green glass and the red glass was put next to the mov able lamp and for the moment it was as sumed that the vision of Mr T for green light was the same as my ownin other words green instead of blue light was made the standard and it was temporarily assumed that both of us were equally af fected by green light The amounts of red perceived by him in two experiments were 713 and 70 per cent as compared with 100 by myself But as he really perceived only 855 per cent of the green light to ob tain the correct value of his perception of red in these two experiments we must take 855 of 706  604 which differs from the value for the red directly obtained by 26 per cent It may be remarked in passing that this case of color blindness was not suspected till revealed by some flicker ex periments with colored discs made by my self in Mr Ts presence A second case which I examined was of a more pronounced character and had pre viously been known to exist Out of 100 rays of red light perceived by myself Mr A was affected only by 1944 per cent violet blue as before being the standard With the same standard only 869 per cent of the green light was perceived Taking green as the standard 229 and 233 per cent of red was perceived and as before s69 of 231  20 instead of 1944 obtained in the direct determination The third case of Mr B was quite similar to the last a wellknown and pronounced instance of red colorblindness Violetblue being taken as the standard 204 per cent of red was perceived and 838 of green light Green being made the standard 255 per cent of red light was perceived and as before 8 8 of 255  2136 instead of 204 as directly obtained when using violetblue light as the standard In these determinations as in all others of a similar kind which I have superin tended the persons experimented on moved the lamp themselves without assistance from me and owing to the presence of screens were in complete ignorance of the results they were obtaining I have been quite surprised to find how quickly persons wholly unused to physical experiments of any kind were able to obtain reliable re sults with the flicker photometer as now arranged They needed a little more time and their probable error was somewhat larger than is the case with an experienced person Each result given above is ob tained from the mean of from ten to fifteen readings registered on the filet of paper con nected with the moving lamp Finally it is to be remembered that in all of these de terminations I have for the time being as sumed my own colorvison to be strictly normal which now that we have this ac curate photometric method is hardly quite a safe proceeding for any man or even woman as some of my unpublished results show OGDEN N ROOD COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY THE OPENING OF THE NEW LABORATORY FOR PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY IN LEIPSIC A SHORT time ago an abstract of the ad dress delivered by Nernst at the opening of the new laboratory for physical chemistry at the University of Gottingen was given in ScIENcE The University in Leipsic has SCIENCESCIENCE recently constructed a physical chemical laboratory which not only equals but ap parently far surpasses the structure in Gottingen As Ostwald points out in the first pages of the pamphlet Das physikalischchem ische Institut der Universitat Leipzig und die Feier seiner Eroffnung Leipsic has taken the lead for a considerable time in physical chemistry It is true that Kopp worked in Heidelberg as early as 1864 but the work of Kopp belongs distinctly to the older school The questions raised by him were such as these What is the relation between the composition of compounds and their physical properties and what is the relation between the constitution of com pounds and their physical properties  Such work of course was and is still of great value but the questions it had to deal with were quite different from those asked by the physical chemist of today who employs also entirely different methods in answer ing his questions Ostwald calls attention to the fact that Kopp was an investigator in his line rather than a teacher also to the very poor equip ment with which he was provided the cal orimeter with which Kopps measurements of specific heat were made being con structed out of a brass matchbox Kopp was invited to Leipsic but declined the call In 1871 Gustav Wiedemann was appointed to the first chair for teaching physical chem istry in Leipsic On the retirement of Hankel in 1887 he gave this up and de voted his entire attention to physics This left the chair which had been occupied by Wiedemann vacant and to this Ostwald was called from Riga He was given the laboratory formerly built for the agricul tural chemist Knop and here all of his work up to the present has been done The entire laboratory was not given up to physical chemistry but a part of it was de voted to general elementary chemistry qual itative and quantitative analysis and phar macology This provision was a wise one since Ostwalds first semester opened with two students and the number was reduced to one at the close of the second The num ber of students increased until at present it has reached about thirty In the old lab oratory only three small poorly lighted and modestly equipped rooms were devoted to students in physical chemistry The difficulties which were being constantly met with are well remembered by everyone who worked with Ostwald during the first ten years of his professorship in Leipsic The water supply was poor the method of heating was bad and as he himself says the rooms were too narrow to permit the use of telescope and scale in physical meas urements When we take into account the condi tions under which Ostwald has done his work and then consider the quantity and quality of the work which has come from his laboratory we are again reminded in a forcible manner of the fact that scientific investigation depends far less upon the equipment than upon the man But the Leipsic school of physical chemistry finally completely outgrew its quarters and a new and elegant laboratory has now been provided This consists in reality of two laboratories a physical and a chemical The first story is devoted to the physical and physical chemical work proper One or two points in connection with the equipment of this part deserve special com ment The large research laboratory is provided with one huge thermostat 370 x 80 x 45 cm This is provided with ther moregulators and stirrers and can be main tained at a constant temperature to a hun dredth of a degree This can be used simultaneously by six or eight students and is particularly convenient in studying JUNE 10 1898 787NS VOL VII NO 180 chemical equilibrium reaction velocity etc This bath is not used for conductivity measurements a separate room being pro vided for that purpose in a quiet part of the building Ostwald lays considerable stress upon a weekly meeting of professors instructors and students which he holds for the pur pose of discussing investigations which are in progress or which have been completed In this way he thinks the professor will gain a more accurate knowledge of what the student has done that his suggestions will be more adequate to the case and that the student will acquire a broader view of the problem in his own hands and a more systematic method of dealing with it One further provision in connection with this part of the laboratory is worthy of note Physical chemistry involves a good deal of theory and Ostwald has observed doubtless as the result of wide experience that it gives rise to considerable discussion especially on the part of beginners Such discussions even when purely scientific naturally interfere also with those who are not taking part in them He has provided a place in which these discussions can be carried on The corridor is fitted up with blackboards crayon and sponges When the controversy becomes warm the con testants can retire to the corridor near the door where it is cool and here settle their differences in the most approved scientific manner The gain to be derived to pure science from this provision may be consid erable especially in that men who are really working will not be disturbed by those who are simply talking The second story is a well equipped gen eral chemical laboratory and scarcely calls for special comment They are prepared in the new as in the old chemical labora tory to give a student a general training in chemistry which is absolutely essential to a subsequent career in physical chemistry The new laboratory was opened on Janu ary 3 1898 There were present all the more prominent physical chemists of Ger many and a number from outside Vant Hoff Arrhenius Landolt Beckmann Waage Nernst Le Blanc Elbs Walden Kiister and others In addition to the physical chemists there were those whose names are household words in other fields of natural science Wislicenus Wiedemann Pfeffer Engelmann Flechsig Zincke Dorn Knorr and a number of the Leipsic faculty in more remote fields Ostwald greeted his guests collectively and a number of them individually and thanked most heartily those who had made the new laboratory possible and his assistants who had aided him in equipping it He expressed the wish that  the spirit of brotherly frankness and the inspiring love of work which accom plished so much in the old laboratory should remain true to the new Without this ethical content our work would be as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal and then gave way to Beckmann During the past year a circular letter was sent to all who had worked with Ostwald in the old laboratory inviting them to con tribute to a fund which would be used to se cure a bust or portrait of their Teacher This was to be presented to him at the opening of the new laboratory as a token of the es teem in which he is held by those who know him best This met with the heartiest re sponse and made it possible not only to secure a bust but also a number of reliefs for the laboratory of such men as Scheele Berthollet Berzelius Faraday Liebig and Bunsen Beckmann made a short address in which he expressed the love and esteem felt for Ostwald by all who have worked under his guidance and presented a sketch of him from the hand of the Leipsic artist Seffners which is to be placed in Ostwalds home This was received with that frank 788 SCIENCEJUNE 10 1898 SCIENCE ness and humility which are so character istic of the master and this now brings us to the most important event of the daythe formal address of Ostwald The speaker did not think it desirable to take up a special topic in physical chemistry because a number of those present were in other fields and would scarcely have fol lowed him He therefore chose a more general subject which touches all branches of science and in which all must be inter estedThe problem of time This problem is discussed at first philosophically and then its direct bearing upon physical chem istry is pointed out Newton regarded time as objective and distinguished in his Prin cipia between absolute and relative time regarding the latter as being contained in the former Kant took the opposite view that time as well as space is subjective But this idea did not exert its influence on the natural sciences until about the middle of this century The experimental develop ment of the physiology of sensation brought out the subjective nature of sense impres sions so clearly that the importance of Kants suggestion began to be felt We must not regard our conception of time as complete but recognize that it is affected by the physiological conditions of our exist ence I regard time as the most general nat ural law Natural laws have this charac teristic They allow the infinite variety of possibility to be reduced to a special case or to special cases of reality and their sig nificance is the greater the more numerous and manifold the phenomena to which the reduction finds application  In this sense time is a natural law The conception of time expresses relations which are repeated in very widely different phenomena Ostwald then proceeds to analyze our conception of time and finds in it the fol lowing four elements  First continuity Time moves on with out interruption During sleep we cannot recognize time and should be led to con clude that it had been interrupted But the consideration of the objective world which has progressed during our sleep shows that the discontinuity of time is only apparent and that it has really progressed without interruption Second the linear nature of time Time is a constant magnitude of such a nature that it is possible to pass from one definite value to another only in one way This is the same as to designate time as having one dimension Third time never returns to a point or value which has been once passed and is thus to be distinguished from a line with which it has much in common since a line can be easily so drawn that it will cut itself Fourth time moves on in one definite order This is absolute and a given suc cession in time cannot be reversed After inquiring into the origin of our conception of these four elements into which time has been analyzed the speaker then considered the bearing of this discus sion upon physical chemistry A very im portant chapter in physical chemistry is that which deals with the velocity of reactions A solution of this problem would not only complete a chapter of the science but would throw light upon the most funda mental questions of psychology and conse quently of philosophy The chemist Wenzel furnished the foun dation more than a hundred years ago for the law which obtains for reaction ve locitythat under the same conditions the velocity is proportional to the concentra tion of the reacting substance More care ful investigation showed that reaction ve locity depends upon the nature of the reacting substances their concentration and temperature and other conditions which influence it entirely out of propor tion to the apparent magnitude of the 789N S VOL VII 180 No cause which is operating A very small amount of a foreign substance which ap parently did not enter into the reaction was found to be capable of increasing the velocity of a reaction to a very great ex tent Examples of such reactions have long been known indeed the transformation of starch into sugar by boiling with acids has been known for more than a century Such action on the part of a foreign sub stance was termed by Mitscherlich and by Berzelius  catalytic Such effects have recently been classed under the general head of changes in the reaction velocity Two experiments were then performed illustrating both acceleration and retarda tion of reaction velocity If to a dilute solution of potassium iodide an equivalent of potassium bromate and acetic acid is added free iodine will separate very slowly and this can be made visible by the pres ence of a little starch If a drop of a so lution of potassium bichromate or ferrous sulphate is added the solution becomes blue in a few moments showing an accel eration in the velocity of the reaction The bichromate does not act as an oxidiz ing agent under these conditions as can be shown ly removing the iodine by means of sodium thiosulphate when the solution will have the yellow color of the unreduced bichromate Further ferrous sulphate which produces the same reaction is a strong reducing agent The retardation of the velocity of reaction was shown as follows When an acid is added to a dilute solution of sodium thio sulphate the solution becomes cloudy after a time The addition of sulphurous acid causes the solution to remain clear for a much longer time This is probably not catalysis in the strict sense but the action of mass Yet there are cases known where the retardation is undoubtedly a catalytic action but these are less suitable for the purpose of demonstration We have then in small amounts of cata lyzers a means of increasing or diminishing the velocity of reactions a thousand or a million times Says Ostwald I should like to express my conviction that it is difficult to overestimate the importance of this for organic life But what may be the technical signifi cance of catalytic action  To increase the velocity of machines a proportionally larger amount of work must be done An express train carrying the same weight as a freight but moving with greater velocity will con sume more coal in traveling the same dis tance A galvanic cell will work more economically the smaller the strength of current Also in the other technical fields velocity is secured at the expense of energy Only in chemcal processes is this avoided The addition of a small amount of a cata lyzer which is not used up in the reaction may enormously increase the velocity of a reaction The significance of this for the industries becomes apparent when we consider how important is the element of time in carry ing out technical processes Could a cata lyzer be found for such processes a factory using the same amount of machinery or apparatus could increase its productivity many fold and thus save interest on capi tal invested or a train could greatly in crease its velocity with the same consump tion of coal As a matter of fact catalyzers have long been used in some of the industries such as the manufacture of sulphuric acid dyeing bleaching etc But up to the present this has been purely empirical and frequently the role played by the catalyzer has not been recognized The intelligent applica tion of catalytic processes to the industries has recently been begun and this is en tirely due to the scientific study of such processes  I regard the field of catalytic phenom 790 SCIENCEJUNE 10 1898 SCIENCE ena as the one in which the next important advances in general chemistry will be made says Ostwald who concluded his address thus the aim of physical chem istry is to discover relations between the different branches of science and instead of increasing the gap between them to be an important factor in effecting their union In the afternoon a banquet was given to those present and in the evening the stu dents held a  Kommers Thus was opened the finest laboratory for physical chemistry now in existence it be ing the fourth in Germany alone That of Landolt in Berlin is the oldest while the laboratories of vaut Hoff in Berlin and Nernst in G6ttingen have scarcely two years of history When we consider these facts and in addition the number of places in which physical chemical investigations are in progress especially in other labora tories in Germany in France Russia Scan dinavia Austria Japan Holland Great Britain and America we recognize that this branch of science has taken its place among the more important natural sci ences And when we consider further that work of the character of that which is described as belonging to the Leipsic school has been in progress for only a little more than a decade of years we are impressed by what has already been accomplished especially in the way of generalization It is to Ostwald that we are in debted for the Zeitschrift in which investi gations could be published for the experi mental verification of the most important theories and for the systematic presenta tion of the facts in his monumental work the Lehrbuch HARRY C JONES CHEMICAL LABORATORY JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY DURING the last few months the Solent has been the scene of some interesting ex periments in wireless telegraphy Under the direction of Signor Marconi two stations have been fitted upone in Bournemouth just opposite the end of the pier and the other at Alum Bay in the Isle of Wight and between these places which are 142 miles apart regular communication has been maintained without the use of any intervening connecting wires On occasion an even greater distance has been traversed for with portable instruments temporarily set up on the cliffs at Swanage it has been found possible to speak with the station at Alum Baynearly 18 miles away But Signor Marconi does not believe that this represents anything like the limits up to which his apparatus can be worked and he is now making the necessary arrangements for exchanging signals with Cherbourg a distance of some 60 miles The instruments employed at Bourne mouth and at Alum Bay are alike in all es sential respects The only outward sign at either place is a tall mast some 120 feet high from which depends a metallic conduc tor Sometimes this is a simple wire at others a narrow strip of ordinary wire net ting has been tried as affording more elec trical capacity but there does not appear to be any great difference in the results In side the stations the first piece of apparatus that catches the eye is an induction coil capable of giving a spark 8 or 10 inches long This with an appropriate battery and a key to control the current constitutes the sending instrument The discharge from the coil passes between two brass balls about 1 inches apart thus giving rise to electromagnetic waves which are radiated in all directions One of the balls is con nected with the external conductor already mentioned the other is put to earth Some  From the London Times 791

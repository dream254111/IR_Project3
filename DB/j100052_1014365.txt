Century Company 1920 This book contrasts American and Euro pean police and the problems of American and European police The author finds that the problem in America is more diffi cult than that in European countries because of the heterogeneity of our popula tion The history and development of Americas police force are discussed One chapter is devoted to the present form of police control another to the special prob lems of police control such as responsible leadership etc and others to removal of police heads effect of commission govern ment on the police force and the result of the city manager plan The author quar rels with the commission plan of govern ment and states that the city manager plan has not been in effect long enough to ap praise its results The major portion of the book is taken up with discussion of the organization of the police department and problems as to the Commissioner or Director of Police the duties of the Chief of Police the problems of the rank and file organization of the de tective force and a chapter on crime pre vention as part of the functions of the Police Department The authors conclusion is that our achievement in the field of police systems is sordid and unworthy Many of his conclu sions are too general to flow from his facts Witness the following Nowhere in the world is there so great an anxiety to place the moral regulation of social affairs in the hands of the police and nowhere are the police so incapable of carrying out such regulation Our concern moreover is for ex ternals for results that are formal and apparent rather than essential We are less anxious about preventing a man from doing wrong to others than in preventing him from doing what we con sider harm to himself CLYDE L KING University of Pennsylvania WOOFTER THOMAS JACKSON Negro Migra tion Pp 195 Price 150 paper 225 cloth New York W D Gray 1920 I am permitted only a few lines in which to call attention to one of the best studies of Negro life in the rural districts of the South that I have seen The author a southern man now field agent of the PhelpsStokes Fund is wellequipped While he has followed statistical methods he has given descriptive interpretations and his work is easy to read After describing the break down of the agricultural regime of slavery and the immediate readjustments made necessary by freedom he considers the present agricultural opportunity Here one finds an excellent account of the tenant system its advantages and dangers He then takes up the movements of population and finds that on the whole there is no cause for pessimism Prior to 1910 the movement was largely from one rural dis trict to another lately industrial centers have been the magnet Sanitation schools protection from violence and injustice in the courts he considers the chief problems to be handled by the state governments He sees certain evils in present practices ie in the fee system to local officials he recognizes the results of neglected child hood he deplores the exclusion by the press of most topics relating to the Negro and the presentation of crime or humorous inci dents as characteristic of the race for he feels that democracy is being tested in the task of working out a program under which two races may live side by side with out conflict A good bibliography is appended CARL KELSEY University of Pennsylvania NOTES KELLOR FRANCES Immigration and the Future Pp xv 276 Price 250 New York George H Doran Co 1920 So much has been published on the ques tion of immigration that it is not easy to 216BOOK DEPARTMENT find a new approach This Miss Kellor has done in an unusual way In calm dispas sionate fashion she surveys the changed attitude of America towards world problems and shows how a new spirit has developed The older immigration is sketched and the administration of the older laws reviewed Then she outlines the racial opinion of the country as shown by the foreign press Part II discusses the varied relations of American business to immigration foreign markets savings and investments of immi grants etc In Part III economic assim ilation is considered and its difficulties indicated Miss Kellor has given us a book which should be read by all who are interested in the questions involved KNOWLES MORRIS Industrial Housing Pp x 393 Price 500 New York McGrawHill Book Company 1920 The author of this book brings to his task the technical knowledge of the successful engineer and the concrete results of his experience as Supervising Engineer in the cantonment construction at Camps Meade and MClellan and as Chief Engineer of the Division of Housing of the Emergency Fleet Corporation In his discussion of the scientific principles underlying successful housing projects he omits no important de tail In fact nine of the thirteen chapters are given over to a consideration of such topics as streets and pavements water supply sewerage and drainage waste dis posal and gas and electric supplies The book however is more than a discussion of those phases of the housing problem of par ticular interest to the expert Throughout Mr Knowles has evidenced his ability to envisage his problem as one concerned with factors other than steel lumber and con crete Cost factors and their relation to wages the preservation of esthetic values the relation between correct housing and labor stability and the interrelation of housing and town planning have all been emphasized although on these points the author might have laid more weight in his initial statement of his problem Not a little of the books value is derived from the interesting array of facts and figures deal ing with such recent wartime projects as Yorkship Sun Village Dundalk and Buck man Village 217

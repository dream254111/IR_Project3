J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107615,ON THE ABERRATIONS OF COMPOUND LENSES AND OBJECTGLASSES,I206976,2 222  XVII ON THE ABERRATIONS OF COMPOUND LENSES AND OBJECTGLASSES BY J F W HERSCHEL ESQ F R S C READ MARCH 22 1821 IT HAS NOT UNFREQUENTLY OF LATE BEEN MADE A SUBJECT OF RE PROACH TO MATHEMATICIANS WHO HAVE OCCUPIED THEMSELVES WITH THE THEORY OF THE REFRACTING TELESCOPE THAT THE PRACTICAL BE NEFIT DERIVED FROM THEIR SPECULATIONS HAS BEEN BY NO MEANS COMMENSURATE TO THE EXPENDITURE OF ANALYTICAL SKILL AND LABOUR THEY HAVE CALLED FOR AND THAT FROM ALL THE ABSTRUSE RESEARCHES OF CLAIRAUT EULER DALEMBERT AND OTHER CELEBRATED GEOMETERS NOTHING HITHERTO HAS RESULTED BEYOND A MASS OF COMPLICATED FORMULAE WHICH THOUGH CONFESSEDLY EXACT IN THEORY HAVE NEVER YET BEEN MADE THE BASIS OF CON STRUCTION FOR A SINGLE GOOD INSTRUMENT AND REMAIN THEREFORE TOTALLY INAPPLICABLE OR AT LEAST UNAPPLIED IN PRACTICE THE SIMPLEST CONSIDERATIONS INDEED SUFFICE FOR THE CORRECTION OF THAT PART OF THE ABERRATION WHICH ARISES FROM THE DIFFERENT REFRANGIBILITY OF THE DIFFERENTLY COLOURED RAYS AND ACCORD INGLY THIS PART OF THE MATHEMATICAL THEORY OF REFRACTING TELESCOPES WAS SOON BROUGHT TO PERFECTION AND HAS RECEIVED NO IMPORTANT ACCESSION SINCE THE ORIGINAL INVENTION OF THE ACHROMATIC OBJECTGLASS INDEED THE THEORETICAL CONSIDERA TIONS ADVANCED ON THIS PART OF THE SUBJECT BY EULER AND DALEMBERT HAVE EVEN HAD A TENDENCY TO RETARD ITS ADVANCE MNENT BY APPEARING TO ESTABLISH RELATIONS AMONG THE RELATIVEMR J F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS C REFRACTIVE POWERS OF MEDIA ON RAYS OF DIFFERENT COLOURS WHICH LATER EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES HAVE EXPLODED IN THE MORE ABSTRUSE AND DIFFICULT PART OF THE THEORY OF OPTICAL INSTRUMENTS WHICH RELATES TO THE CORRECTION OF THE SPHERICAL ABERRATION THE NECESSITY OF AN APPEAL TO THE POWERS OF ALGEBRAIC INVESTIGATION HAS BEEN ALL ALONG ACKTLOWLEDGED AND AS THE SUBJECT IS CONFESSEDLY WITHIN ITS REACH AND PRE SENTS NONE OF THOSE DIFFICULTIES WHICH OBSTRUCT OUR PROGRESS IN THE TRANSCENDENTAL ANALYSIS BUT MERELY SUCH ASARISE FROM THE INVOLVED NATURE OF THE EQUATIONS AND THE NUMBER OF SYMBOLS WHICH ENTER INTO THEM IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THAT THE APPEAL WOULD LONG ERE THIS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THE ARTIST HAVE BOWED TO THE DICTATES HOWEVER ORACULAR OF A THEORY WHICH HE WAS SATISFIED HAD ITS FOUNDATION IN UNERRING TRUTH AND THE RESULT OF THEIR COMBINED LABOURS HAVE BEEN THE ATTAINMENT OF ALL THE PERFECTION THE TELESCOPE IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF UNHAPPILY HOWEVER THIS IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE INVESTIGA TIONS IT IS TRUE HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATED ON EACH OTHER FORMULA HAVE BEEN DEDUCED AND EVEN TABLES COMPUTED FROM THEM  BUT THE INVESTIGATIONS FROM THEIR DRY AND LABORIOUS NATURE AND THE ALMOST TOTAL WANT OF THAT SYMMETRY WHICH IS ESPECIALLY NECESSARY IN SO COMPLICATED A SUBJECT HAVE BEEN STUDIED BY FEW THE FORMULA REQUIRING A MORE EXTENSIVE SHARE OF ALGEBRAICAL KNOWLEDGE THAN CAN BE EXPECTED IN A PRACTICAL OPTICIAN ARE THROWN ASIDE BY HIM IN DESPAIR AND THE TABLES HITHERTO CONSTRUCTED FROM THEORY BEING FOUNDED ON DATA WHICH MAY NEVER AGAIN OCCUR ARE WORSE THAN USELESS SERVING ONLY TO MISLEAD IN CONSEQUENCE THE BEST AND MOST SUCCESS FUL ARTISTS ARE CONTENT TO WORK THEIR GLASSES BY TRIAL OR BY EMPIRICAL RULES EMBODYING THE RESULT OF NUMEROUS PRECEDING 223224 MRJ F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS OF TRIALS AND WHICH THEREFORE HAVE PROBABLY SOME ANALOGY TO WHAT WOULD BE THE FINAL RESULTS OF THEORY IF PRESENTED IN A TANGIBLE SHAPE AND ACCOMMODATED TO THE PECULIARITIES OF THEIR CONSTRULCTIONS THE OBJECT OF THE FOLLOWING INVESTIGATIONS IS TO REMOVE OR LIGHTEN THESE OBJECTIONS BY PRESENTING FIRST OF ALL UNDER A GENERAL AND UNIFORM ANALYSIS THE WHOLE THEORY OF THE ABER RATIONS OF SPHERICAL SURFACES AND IN THE NEXT PLACE BY FUR NISHING PRACTICAL RESULTS OF EASY COMPUTATION TO THE ARTIST DISENTANGLED FROM ALL ALGEBRAICAL COMPLEXITY AND APPLICABLE BY INTERPOLATIONS OF THE SIMPLEST POSSIBLE KIND TO ALL THE ORDI NARY VARIETIES OF THE MATERIALS ON WHICH HE HAS TO WORK IN THE EXECUTION OF THE FORMER PART OF THIS PLAN SYMMETRY AND SIMPLICITY IN THE DISPOSAL OF THE SYMBOLS IS THE OBJECT CHIEFLY CONSULTED TO ATTAIN THIS AND AT THE SAME TIME AVOID CIRCUM LOCUTION IN THE DESCRIPTIVE PART OF THE PROCESSES I HAVE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO ADOPT A LANGUAGE SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM THAT USUALLY EMPLOYED BY OPTICAL WRITERS INSTEAD OF SPEAKING OF THEFOCAL LENGTHS OF LENSES OR THE RADII OF THEIR SURFACES I SPEAK OF THEIR POWERS AND CURVATURES ALWAYS DESIGNATING BY THE FORMER EXPRESSION THE QUOTIENT OF UNITY BY THE NUMBER OF PARTS OF ANY SCALE WHICH THE FOCAL LENGTH IS EQUAL TO AND BY THE LATTER THE QUOTIENT SIMILARLY DERIVED FROM THE RADIUS IN QUESTION THIS MODE OF EXPRESSION DOES NO VIOLENCE TO PRO PRIETY AS THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF A LENS IS REALLY INVERSELY PROPORTIONAL TO ITS FOCAL LENGTH AND THE CURVATURE OF A SURFACE IS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD TO BE RECIPROCALLY AS ITS RADIUS WHILE IT GIVES US TLHEADVANTAGE OF EXPRESSING CONCISELY AND NATURALLY ALL THE MOST USEFUL PROPOSITIONS IN OPTICS IT IS CERTAINLY SIMPLER FOR EXAMPLE TO SAY THAT  THE POWER OF ANY COMCOMPOUND LNSES AND OBJECTGLASSES 2S5 POUND LENS IS THE SUM OF THE POWERS OF ITS SEPARATE CONM PONENT LENSES THAN TOEXPRESS THE SAME THING BY SAYING THAT TO OBTAIN THE FOCAL LENGTH OF A COMPOUND LENS WE MUST DIVIDE THE PRODUCT OF THE FOCAL LENGTHS OF ITS COMPONENT LENSES BY THE SUM OF ALL THE SIMILAR PRODUCTS WHICH CANBE FORMED BY COIBINING THEM OMITTING ONE IN EACH COMBINA TION  OR TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE POWER OF A LENS IS EQUAL TO A CERTAIN COEFFICIENT MULTIPLIED BY THE DIFFERENCE OF THE CURVA TURES OF ITS SURFACES THAN TO ASSERTTHAT THE FOCAL LENGTH IS EQUAL TO A CERTAIN COEFFICIENT MULTIPLIED BY THE PRODUCT OF THE RADII AND DIVIDED BY THEIR DIFFERENCE THIS CONTRACTION IN LANGUAGE IS SO CONVENIENT THAT I HOPE TO SEE IT GENERALLY ADOPTED THE FORMULAE IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES EXTEND NO FARTHER THAN THE SECOND TERM IN THE DEVELOPEMENT OF THE ABERRATION OR THAT DEPENDING ON THE SQUARES OF THE SEMIAPERTURES IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY TO HAVE CARRIED THEM TO THE FOURTH AND EVEN HIGHER POWERS AND SHOULD OBJECTGLASSES OF VERY GREAT APERTURE IN COMPARISON WITH THEIR FOCAL LENGTHS BE EVER CON STRUCTED IT MAY BECOME NECESSARY BUT THE DIMENSIONS OF OUR PRESENT TELESCOPES ARE FAR INDEED FROM CALLING FOR THE IMMENSE COMPLEXITY OF ALGEBRAIC SYMBOLS INTO WHICH THIS ATTEMPT WOULD PLUNGE US NOT TO SPEAK OF THE TEDIOUSNESS OF THE NUMERICAL COMPUTATIONS WHERE EQUATIONS OF THE TENTH AND HIGHER DEGREES ARE TO BE RESOLVED THE GENERAL VALUE OF THE ABERRATION FOR ANY NUMBER OF SPHERICAL SURFACES PLACED AT ANY FINITE DISTANCES FROM EACH OTHER IS ASSIGNED BY MEANS OF AN EQUATION OF FINITE DIFFERENCES OF THE FIRST ORDER THE INTEGRATION OF THIS PRESENTS NO DIFFICULTY BUT I HAVE THOUGHT IT UNNECESSARY IN THE PRESENT PAPER TO PURSUE IT FARTHER IN226 MR J F W HERSCHEL ON THEABERRATIONS OF ITS DEVELOPEMENT THAN WAS REQUIRED FOR ITS APPLICATION TO THE THEORY OF THIN LENSES PLACED IN CONTACT AND ESPECIALLY TO THAT OF DOUBLE OBJECTGLASSES RESERVING THE THEORY OF EYE PIECES MICROSCOPES C AS WELL AS THAT OF THICK LENSES FOR A SECOND COMMUNICATION SHOULD THE SOCIETY HONOUR THIS WITH A PLACE IN THEIR TRANSACTIONS THE PROBLEM OF THE DESTRUCTION OF THE SPHERICAL ABERRATION IN A DOUBLE OR MULTIPLE LENS IS WELL KNOWN TO BE INDETERMI NATE THE ALGEBRAIC CONDITIONS REQUISITE FOR THAT PURPOSE FUR NISHING BUT A SINGLE EQUATION AT LEAST WHEN THE NEAN RAYS ONLY ARE CONSIDERED TO FIX ON THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITION FOR LIMITING THE PROBLEM IS A MATTER OF CONSIDERABLE DELICACY DALEMBERT HAS PROPOSED AMONG OTHERS OPUSC TOM 3 ART 74O TO ANNIHILATE THE SPHERICAL ABERRATION FOR RAYS OF ALLCOLOURS A REFINEMENT WHICH MIGHT ALMOST BE TERMED PUERILE WERE IT NOT FOR THE RESPECT DUE TO SO GREAT A NAME IT HAS BESIDES THE INCONVENIENCE OF LEADING TO EQUATIONS OF THE FOURTH DEGREE A MUCH BETTER CONDITION IN EVERY POINT OF VIEW IS ANOTHER PROPOSED BY THE SAME PROFOUND GEOMETER IN ART 758 VI THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ABERRATION FOR AN OBJECT SITUATED OUT OF THE AXIS OF THE TELESCOPE OR IN OTHER WORDS THE RENDERING THE WHOLE FIELD OF VIEW EQUALLY PERFECT SO FAR AS THE OBJECTGLASS IS CONCERNED BUT EVEN THIS IS PERHAPS CAR RYING REFINEMENT TOO FAR THE DIFFERENCE OF THE ABERRATIONS OF AN OBJECTGLASS IN AND OUT OF THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD IS SO SMALL IN ORDINARY TELESCOPES AS TO HAVE ESCAPED SO FAR AS MY ENQUIRIES HAVE GONE THE NOTICE OF THE BEST PRACTICAL OPTICIANS  I PASS OVER THE CONSTRUCTION PROPOSED BY DALEMBERT IN ART 746 AS HAVING NO RECOMMENDATION BUT THAT OF AVOIDING A BIQUADRATIC EQUATION THOUGH IT IS TRUE THE RADII RESULTING FROM IT MIGHT BE USEDCOMPOUND LENSES AND OBJECTGLASSES AND I HAVE CONSULTED MANY NOR OF COURSE HAS ANY PART OF THEIR ATTENTION BEEN DIRECTED TO OBVIATE EXPERIMENTALLY A SOURCE OF INDISTINCTNESS THEY COULD NOT PERCEIVE TO EXIST CLAIRAUT IN THE MEMOIRS OF THE ACADEMY FOR 1757 HAS COMPUTED THE RADII OF A DOUBLE OBJECTGLASS FROM THE CON DITION OF THEIR TOUCHING THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THEIR INTERIOR SURFACES A VERY DESIRABLE THING IN PRACTICE AND THE CURVATURES WHICH RESULT ARE VERY CONVENIENT CLAIRAUT HOWEVER HAS EMPLOYED IN HIS COMPUTATIONS INDICES OF RE FRACTION 1600 AND 155 HIGHER ESPECIALLY THE LATTER THAN WHAT ARE NOW EASILY MET WITH AND WHEN THE AVERAGE VALUES SUCH AS ARE LIKELY TO OCCUR MOST FREQUENTLY ARE EMPLOYED THE CONSTRUCTION BECOMES IMAGINARY FOR THE MORE DISPERSIVE KINDS OF GLASS AND WITHIN THE LIMITS FOR WHICH IT IS REAL THE RADII CHANGE SO RAPIDLY AS TO RENDER IT DIFFICULT TO INTERPOLATE BETWEEN THEIR CALCULATED VALUES SO THAT TO THE ARTIST WHO IS NO ALGEBRAIST THIS CONSTRUCTION LOSES MUCH OF ITS REAL AD VANTAGE THERE REMAINS A CONDITION UNACCOUNTABLY OVERLOOKED SO FAR AS MY READING HAS EXTENDED AND WHICH THE NATURE OF THE FORMULSE OF ABERRATION AS GIVEN IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES ALMOST FORCES ON OUR ATTENTION I MEAN THE DESTRUCTION OF THE ABERRATION NOT ONLY FOR PARALLEL RAYS OR WHEN THE TELE SCOPE IS DIRECTED TO CELESTIAL OBJECTS BUT ALSO FOR RAYS DI VERGING FROM A POINT AT ANY FINITE DISTANCE THE PERFECTION OF THE TELESCOPE WHEN DIRECTED TO LAND OBJECTS SEEMS TO REQUIRE THIS  AND THOUGH IN ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES IT MAY APPEAR UNCALLED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION POSSESSES OTHER ADVAN TAGES OF SO HIGH AN ORDER AS TO RECOMMEND IT EVEN THERE THESE ARE LST THE VERY MODERATE CURVATURES REQUIRED FOR THE MDCCCXXI G G 97MR J F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS OF SURFACES IN THIS RESPECT IT HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF MOST IF NOT ALL OF THE CONSTRUCTIONS HITHERTO PROPOSED ON THEORETICAL GROUNDS EDLY THAT IN THIS CONSTRUCTION THE CURVATURES OF THE TWO EXTERIOR SURFACES OF THE COMPOUND LENS OF GIVEN FOCAL LENGTH VARY WITHIN EXTREMELY NARROW LIMITS BY ANY VARIATION IN EITHER THE REFRACTIVE OR DISPERSIVE POWERS AT ALL LIKELY TO OCCUR IN PRACTICE THIS REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCE AFFORDS A SIMPLE PRACTICAL RULE APPLICABLE IN ALL ORDINARY CASES FOR CALCULATING THE CURVATURES IN ANY PROPOSED STATE OF THE DATA AND REQUIRING ONLY THE USE OF THEOREMS WITH WHICH EVERY ARTIST MUST BE FAMILIAR AND AT ALL EVENTS RENDERING IT EXTREMELY EASY TO INTERPOLATE BETWEEN CALCULATED VALUES 3DLY THAT THE TWO INTERIOR SURFACES APPROACH IN ALL CASES SO NEARLY TO COINCIDENCE THAT NO CONSIDERABLE PRACTICAL ERROR CAN ARISE FROM NEGLECTING THEIR DIFFERENCE AND FIGURING THEM ON TOOLS OF EQUAL RADII INDEED FOR A RATIO OF THE DISPERSIVE POWERS A LITTLE ABOVE THE AVERAGE THEY ARE RIGOROUSLY COINCI DENT AND THIS CONSTRUCTION COINCIDES WITH THAT OF CLAIRAUT ABOVEMENTIONED AND SO NEARLY IS THIS APPROACH TO EQUALITY OF CURVATURE SUSTAINED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF THE FUNCTION THAT EVEN WHEN THE RATIO OF THE DISPERSIVE POWERS IS SO LOW AS O75 I A CASE ALMOST USELESS TO CONSIDER THE DIFFERENCE AMOUNTS TO LESS THAN A 4OTH PART OF THE CURVATURE OF EACH  I GENERAL FORMULE FOR THE FOCAL DISTANCES AND

SPHERICAL ABERRA TION OF ANY SYSTEM OF SURFACES SUPPOSE THE RAY AFTER PASSING THROUGH THE NTH SURFACE TO BE INCIDENT ON THE N 1T ITS ABERRATION HERE WILL ARISE FROM TWO CAUSES IST THAT AFTER TRAVERSING THE N PRECEDING SURFACES INSTEAD OF CONVERGING TO OR DIVERGING FROM THE FOCUS FOR CENTRAL RAYS ITS DIRECTION WAS REALLY TO OR FROM A POINT IN THE AXIS DISTANT FROM THAT FOCUS BY THE TOTAL ABERRATION OF THOSE N SURFACES AND 2DLY THAT BEING INCIDENT AT A DISTANCE FROM THE VERTEX OF THE NLTH SURFACE A NEW ABERRATION WILL BE PRODUCED HERE WHICH BE ING AS WELL AS TLE OTHER OF SMALL AMOUNT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE DIFFERENTIAL CALCULUS ALLOW US TO REGARD AS INDEPENDENT OF IT AND WHICH BEING COMPUTED SEPARATELY AND ADDED TO IT GIVES THE WHOLE ABERRATION OF THE SYSTEM OF N1 SURFACES S37E38 MR J F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS OF THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SMALL ALTERATIONS IN THE VALUES OFF PRODUCED BY THE ABERRATIONS IF WE DENOTE BY SF THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OFF DUE TO THE ACTION OF THE

TO WHICH THE LENS IS TO BE APPLIED MUST DECIDE IN A BURNING GLASS IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE A SLIGHT CONSIDERATION WILL SUFFICE TO SHOW THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURES PRO DUCED IN THE FOCI OF A DOUBLE CONVEX LENS OF EQUAL RADII AND ONE OF THE SAME FOCAL LENGTH BUT OF THE BEST FORM MUST BE VERY CONSIDERABLE IN ORDER TO TRY WHETHER EVEN THE LATTER MIGHT NOT BE IMPROVED BY THE SHORTENING OF THE FOCUS AND THE SUPERIOR CONCENTRATION OF THE EXTERIOR RAYS BY APPLYING A CORRECTING LENS OF ONE OF THE FORMS ABOVE CALCULATED IN SPITE OF THE LOSS OF HEAT IN PASSING THROUGH A SECOND GLASS I PROCURED TWO LENSES TO BE FIGURED TO THE RADII ASSIGNED IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE FOREGOING TABLE THEY WERE ABOUT THREE INCHES IN APERTURE AND WHEN COMBINED AS ABOVE DIRECTED THE ABERRATION WAS ALMOST TOTALLY DESTROYED AND PROBABLY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO COMPLETELY HAD THE INDEX OF REFRACTION PROPER TO THE GLASS BEEN EMPLOYED INSTEAD OF THAT ADOPTED IN OUR CALCULATION FOR BREVITY THEIR COM BINED EFFECT AS A BURNING LENS APPEARED TO ME DECIDEDLY SUPERIOR TO THAT OF THE FIRST LENS USED ALONE AND THERE IS THERE FORE GOOD REASON TO PRESUME THAT THE EFFECT OF THE OTHER CON STRUCTION WHICH WITH THE SAME LOSS OF HEAT AFFORDS A MUCH GREATER CONTRACTION OF THE FOCUS WOULD BE STILL BETTER AND I REGRET NOT HAVING TRIED IT IN PREFERENCE 14 IN EYEGLASSES AND MAGNIFIERS IF WE WOULD EXAMINE A MINUTE OBJECT WITH MUCH ATTENTION AS A SMALL INSECT OR TWHEN APPLIED TO ASTRONOMICAL PURPOSES IF WE WOULD SCRUTINIZE THE APPEARANCE OF A PLANET A LUNAR MOUNTAIN THE NUCLEUS OF A COMET OR A CLOSE DOUBLE STAR WHERE EXTENT OF FIELD IS OF LESS CONSEQUENCE THAN PERFECT DISTINCTNESS IN THE CENTRAL POINT TOO MUCH PAINS CANNOT BE TAKEN IN DESTROYING THE CENTRAL ABERRA 247248 MR J F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS OF TION THERE IS ANOTHER CASE IN WHICH AN APLANATIC EYEGLASS SHOULD BE EMPLOYED VIZ IN EXAMINING THE PARABOLIC FIGURE OF A SPECULUM OR THE PERFECT ADJUSTMENT OF AN OBJECTGLASS IF THE SURFACE OF THE SPECULUM OR OBJECTGLASS BE DIVIDED INTO CONCENTRIC ANNULI BY DIAPHRAGMS COVERING DIFFERENT PARTS OF IT IN SUCCESSION THE RAYS INCIDENT ON THESE AFTER CROSSING IN THEIR FOCUS WILL BE SPREAD OVER CORRESPONDING ANNULI ON THE SURFACE OF THE EYEGLASS AND IF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MIR ROR AND EYEGLASS WHEN ADJUSTED TO PERFECT VISION CONTINUE THE SAME FOR ALL THE ANNULI WE CONCLUDE THAT THE FIGURE OF THE SPECULUM IS PERFECT IT IS SO HOWEVER ONLY WITH RESPECT TO THAT PARTICULAR EYEGLASS AND IF THE ABERRATIONS OF THIS BE NOT CORRECTED ALL THE PAINS OF THE ARTIST WILL ONLY PRODUCE A MIRROR AFFECTED WITH PROPORTIONAL AND OPPOSITE IMPERFECTIONS IT IS TRUE THE USE OF A VERY HIGH MAGNTIFYING POWER OBVIATES THIS OBJECTION IN GREAT MEASURE BY CONFINING THE ABERRATION OF THE EYEGLASS WITHIN A NARROWER COMPASS BUT IT IS BETTER IN THEORY AND UNDOUBTEDLY MORE CONVENIENT IN PRACTICE TO AN NIHILATE IT ALTOGETHER THE ABERRATION IN THE EYE APPEARS TO ME TO BE ENTIRELY OUT OF THE QUESTION HERE BUT THE CONSIDERA TION OF THAT POINT WOULD LEAD US AWAY FROM THE PRESENT SUB JECT ON THE OTHER HAND WHEN A MODERATELY DISTINCT BUT EXTEN SIVE FIELD OF VIEW IS OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN A PERFECT BUT CONFINED ONE AS IN SPECTACLES READING GLASSES MAGNIFIERS OF MODERATE POWER AND EYEGLASSES FOR CERTAIN ASTRONOMICAL PURPOSES THE CORRECTION OF THE ABERRATION IN THE CENTRE OF THE FIELD MAY BE

IS NECESSARY 25 THIS TABLE AND THE PRECEDING AFFORD ROOM FOR ONE OR TWO REMARKS OF SOME MOTENIT AND FIRST WITH REGARD TO THEMR J F W HERSCHEL ON THE ABERRATIONS OF PUTTING TOGETHER OF THE LENSES IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT FOR THE LOWER VALUES OF  OR THE MORE DISPERSIVE VARIETIES OF FLINT GLASS THE CURVATURE OF THE THIRD SURFACE IS A VERY LITTLE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE SECOND SO THAT THE GLASSES WHEN LAID TOGETHER IN THEIR PROPER POSITION WILL HAVE A MINUTE INTERVAL BETWEEN THEM AT A CERTAIN VALUE OF A BETWEEN 0O55 AND O6GO O58 NEARLY THIS INTERVAL VANISHES AND THE GLASSES ARE IN CONTACT OVER THEIR WHOLE SURFACE FOR HIGHER DISPERSIVE RATIOS IF LAID CLOSE TOGETHER THEY WOULD TOUCH IN THE VERTEX THIS IS REGARDED AS AN OBJECTION IN PRACTICE AND JUSTLY ESPE CIALLY WHEN THE CURVATURES OF THE SURFACES IN CONTACT DIFFER CONSIDERABLY AS THEIR PRESSURE ON EACH OTHER AT THE CENTRE MUST TEND TO DISTORT THEIR FIGURES AND DISTURB THE UNIFORMITY OF THEIR DENSITY NOT TO SPEAK OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE COLOURS OF THIN PLATES WHOSE EFFECT ON VISION IS MORE PROBLEMATIC BUT IN FACT THE DIFFERENCE OF THE CURVATURES IN THIS CONSTRUC TION IS SO VERY TRIFLING AS TO FALL WITHIN THE LIMITS OF PRACTICAL ERRORS AND THEREFORE IF THE SEPARATION OF THE TWO GLASSES BY A RING OF METAL WHICH IN A O1 FEET OBJECTGLASS OF 5 INCHES APERTURE EVEN IN THE VERY UNFAVOURABLE CASE OF SO7O NEED NOT EXCEED I4OOTH OF AN INCH IN THICKNESS BE DEEMED UN ADVISABLE IT MAY BE NEGLECTED AND THE GLASSES GROUND TO THE SAME RADIUS PROVIDED ONLY THE NECESSARY ALTERATIONS ARE MADE IN THE OTHER SURFACES TO PRESERVE THE PROPER PROPORTION OF THEIR FOCAL LENGTHS 26 WITH REGARD TO THE INTERPOLATION OF THE TABLES ABOVE GIVEN FOR INTERMEDIATE VALUES OF AR IF WE CAST OUR EYES DOWN THE SECOND AND 5TH COLUMNS WE CANNOT BUT BE

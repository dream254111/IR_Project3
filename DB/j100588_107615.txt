objectglasses By J F W HERSCHEL Esq F R S c Read March 22 1821 IT has not unfrequently of late been made a subject of re proach to mathematicians who have occupied themselves with the theory of the refracting telescope that the practical be nefit derived from their speculations has been by no means commensurate to the expenditure of analytical skill and labour they have called for and that from all the abstruse researches of CLAIRAUT EULER DALEMBERT and other celebrated geometers nothing hitherto has resulted beyond a mass of complicated formulae which though confessedly exact in theory have never yet been made the basis of con struction for a single good instrument and remain therefore totally inapplicable or at least unapplied in practice The simplest considerations indeed suffice for the correction of that part of the aberration which arises from the different refrangibility of the differently coloured rays and accord ingly this part of the mathematical theory of refracting telescopes was soon brought to perfection and has received no important accession since the original invention of the achromatic objectglass Indeed the theoretical considera tions advanced on this part of the subject by EULER and DALEMBERT have even had a tendency to retard its advance mnent by appearing to establish relations among the relativeMr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations c refractive powers of media on rays of different colours which later experimental researches have exploded In the more abstruse and difficult part of the theory of optical instruments which relates to the correction of the spherical aberration the necessity of an appeal to the powers of algebraic investigation has been all along acktlowledged and as the subject is confessedly within its reach and pre sents none of those difficulties which obstruct our progress in the transcendental analysis but merely such asarise from the involved nature of the equations and the number of symbols which enter into them it might have been expected that the appeal would long ere this have been successful the artist have bowed to the dictates however oracular of a theory which he was satisfied had its foundation in unerring truth and the result of their combined labours have been the attainment of all the perfection the telescope is susceptible of Unhappily however this is far from being the case Investiga tions it is true have been accumulated on each other formula have been deduced and even tables computed from them  but the investigations from their dry and laborious nature and the almost total want of that symmetry which is especially necessary in so complicated a subject have been studied by few the formula requiring a more extensive share of algebraical knowledge than can be expected in a practical optician are thrown aside by him in despair and the tables hitherto constructed from theory being founded on data which may never again occur are worse than useless serving only to mislead In consequence the best and most success ful artists are content to work their glasses by trial or by empirical rules embodying the result of numerous preceding 223224 MrJ F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of trials and which therefore have probably some analogy to what would be the final results of theory if presented in a tangible shape and accommodated to the peculiarities of their construlctions The object of the following investigations is to remove or lighten these objections by presenting first of all under a general and uniform analysis the whole theory of the aber rations of spherical surfaces and in the next place by fur nishing practical results of easy computation to the artist disentangled from all algebraical complexity and applicable by interpolations of the simplest possible kind to all the ordi nary varieties of the materials on which he has to work In the execution of the former part of this plan symmetry and simplicity in the disposal of the symbols is the object chiefly consulted To attain this and at the same time avoid circum locution in the descriptive part of the processes I have found it necessary to adopt a language somewhat different from that usually employed by optical writers Instead of speaking of thefocal lengths of lenses or the radii of their surfaces I speak of their powers and curvatures always designating by the former expression the quotient of unity by the number of parts of any scale which the focal length is equal to and by the latter the quotient similarly derived from the radius in question This mode of expression does no violence to pro priety as the magnifying power of a lens is really inversely proportional to its focal length and the curvature of a surface is always understood to be reciprocally as its radius while it gives us tlheadvantage of expressing concisely and naturally all the most useful propositions in optics It is certainly simpler for example to say that  the power of any comcompound lnses and objectglasses 2s5 pound lens is the sum of the powers of its separate conm ponent lenses than toexpress the same thing by saying that to obtain the focal length of a compound lens we must divide the product of the focal lengths of its component lenses by the sum of all the similar products which canbe formed by coibining them omitting one in each combina tion  or to announce that the power of a lens is equal to a certain coefficient multiplied by the difference of the curva tures of its surfaces than to assertthat the focal length is equal to a certain coefficient multiplied by the product of the radii and divided by their difference This contraction in language is so convenient that I hope to see it generally adopted The formulae in the following pages extend no farther than the second term in the developement of the aberration or that depending on the squares of the semiapertures It would have been easy to have carried them to the fourth and even higher powers and should objectglasses of very great aperture in comparison with their focal lengths be ever con structed it may become necessary but the dimensions of our present telescopes are far indeed from calling for the immense complexity of algebraic symbols into which this attempt would plunge us not to speak of the tediousness of the numerical computations where equations of the tenth and higher degrees are to be resolved The general value of the aberration for any number of spherical surfaces placed at any finite distances from each other is assigned by means of an equation of finite differences of the first order The integration of this presents no difficulty but I have thought it unnecessary in the present paper to pursue it farther in226 Mr J F W HERSCHEL on theaberrations of its developement than was required for its application to the theory of thin lenses placed in contact and especially to that of double objectglasses reserving the theory of eye pieces microscopes c as well as that of thick lenses for a second communication should the Society honour this with a place in their Transactions The problem of the destruction of the spherical aberration in a double or multiple lens is well known to be indetermi nate the algebraic conditions requisite for that purpose fur nishing but a single equation at least when the nean rays only are considered To fix on the best possible condition for limiting the problem is a matter of considerable delicacy DALEMBERT has proposed among others Opusc Tom 3 Art 74o to annihilate the spherical aberration for rays of allcolours a refinement which might almost be termed puerile were it not for the respect due to so great a name It has besides the inconvenience of leading to equations of the fourth degree A much better condition in every point of view is another proposed by the same profound geometer in Art 758 vi the destruction of the aberration for an object situated out of the axis of the telescope or in other words the rendering the whole field of view equally perfect so far as the objectglass is concerned But even this is perhaps car rying refinement too far The difference of the aberrations of an objectglass in and out of the centre of the field is so small in ordinary telescopes as to have escaped so far as my enquiries have gone the notice of the best practical opticians  I pass over the construction proposed by DALEMBERT in Art 746 as having no recommendation but that of avoiding a biquadratic equation though it is true the radii resulting from it might be usedcompound lenses and objectglasses and I have consulted many nor of course has any part of their attention been directed to obviate experimentally a source of indistinctness they could not perceive to exist CLAIRAUT in the Memoirs of the Academy for 1757 has computed the radii of a double objectglass from the con dition of their touching throughout the whole extent of their interior surfaces a very desirable thing in practice and the curvatures which result are very convenient CLAIRAUT however has employed in his computations indices of re fraction 1600 and 155 higher especially the latter than what are now easily met with and when the average values such as are likely to occur most frequently are employed the construction becomes imaginary for the more dispersive kinds of glass and within the limits for which it is real the radii change so rapidly as to render it difficult to interpolate between their calculated values so that to the artist who is no algebraist this construction loses much of its real ad vantage There remains a condition unaccountably overlooked so far as my reading has extended and which the nature of the formulse of aberration as given in the following pages almost forces on our attention I mean the destruction of the aberration not only for parallel rays or when the tele scope is directed to celestial objects but also for rays di verging from a point at any finite distance The perfection of the telescope when directed to land objects seems to require this  and though in astronomical telescopes it may appear uncalled for the construction possesses other advan tages of so high an order as to recommend it even there these are lst the very moderate curvatures required for the MDCCCXXI G g 97Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of surfaces in this respect it has the advantage of most if not all of the constructions hitherto proposed on theoretical grounds edly That in this construction the curvatures of the two exterior surfaces of the compound lens of given focal length vary within extremely narrow limits by any variation in either the refractive or dispersive powers at all likely to occur in practice This remarkable circumstance affords a simple practical rule applicable in all ordinary cases for calculating the curvatures in any proposed state of the data and requiring only the use of theorems with which every artist must be familiar and at all events rendering it extremely easy to interpolate between calculated values 3dly That the two interior surfaces approach in all cases so nearly to coincidence that no considerable practical error can arise from neglecting their difference and figuring them on tools of equal radii Indeed for a ratio of the dispersive powers a little above the average they are rigorously coinci dent and this construction coincides with that of CLAIRAUT abovementioned and so nearly is this approach to equality of curvature sustained throughout the whole extent of the function that even when the ratio of the dispersive powers is so low as o75 i a case almost useless to consider the difference amounts to less than a 4oth part of the curvature of each  I General formule for the focal distances and

for central rays Before proceeding to investigate the more complicated cases of the aberrations of several surfaces we will deduce from the first of these expressions the general equations which determine the place of the focus of central rays after refraction at any number of spherical surfaces equations we shall have occasion to use hereafter Let r  r r3 c be the curvatures of any number of surfaces A1 A A3 c which form the common boundaries of the media o i   c fig s and let the relative index of refraction out of the medium o into i be  out of 1 into 9  and so on also I g let P O t c be the absolute refractive densities or in dices of refraction out of a vacuum into these several media then will o ma I  mIr o m i mm3 and so on Moreover let t t2 t3 c be the respectivecompound lenses and objectglasses intervals between the first and second the second and third surfaces and so on or t A1 A2 t A2A c and letfif2 c be the reciprocal distances of the central focus after the ist 2d c refraction from the respective surfaces or the values of  A  c We here suppose AI ql A2 I2 the positive values of r to correspond to surfaces whose con vexity is turned towards the original radiant Q provided its distance be positive while the positive values off indicate a situation of the focus q on the opposite side of the surface With regard to t its values are necessarily positive in cases of refraction but when m  i which corresponds to those of reflexion which are thus equally included in the present analysis t has a negative value This premised if we make D o or the distance of the radiant point infinite the focus for parallel and central rays will be assigned by the equation flm  r Let c denote this value off and plm r c then will  p  c denote the reciprocals of the principal focal lengths of the several surfaces in situ i e supposing the adjacent media in each case continued to infinity We have then in general the equation f rmD Suppose nowf andf m and m qp and p to represent any two consecutive values off m and q in the seriesf f3 c c Then since the focus after any refraction becomes the radiant point corresponding to the next we have T7 ft  fI f 231Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of and the equationf  m D becomes f y c This is in fact an equation of differences between the con secutive values off and the general value may therefore be obtained by integration or its particular ones deduced in suc cession from each other when the integration is impractica ble from the values assigned to m q and t The greatest simplification it appears to admit is its reduction to an equa tion of the d order and first degree which may be performed by assuming u t when the equation will become after the necessary reductions 0fto ull I i i m  mf OU C  aR t v u  2 U It will not be necessary to examine particularly all the inte grable cases or to discuss at present the form of the general value of u orf in terms of q m and t This latter subject is elegantly treated by LAGRANGE in a Memoir  Sur la Theorie des Lunettes in the collection of the Academy of Berlin Acad Berl 1778 to which we may refer We need only remark that whatever be its integral it must necessarily be of the form MND OPD The original distance of the first radiant entering as the arbi trary constant and being therefore always involved in the same simple algebraic form whatever be the number and position of the surfaces 3 Two cases of the equation however are worthy of a more particular examination The first is when the number of surfaces is infinite and the intervals separating them infinitely 2g3compound lenses and objectglasses 233 diminished In this case the refractive power of the medium varies by insensible gradations and if we suppose both it and the radii of curvature of the layers of equal density to vary according to a given law we shall have both y and r expressed in functions of the depth to which the ray has penetrated at any moment of its course This is the case with the crystalline lens of the eye Dr BREWSTERS ob servations have demonstrated that this humour increases very rapidly in density from the circumference to the centre and to apply our general equation to the evaluation of its focal length we must proceed as follows Taking x to re present the depth of any layer whose thickness in the middle is dx the curvatures r and r of its surfaces will be r and r  dr We have also t  dx tdxd2x taking x for the independent variable Moreover since   m we have hd p and in consequence im d Hence we obtain im r M neglecting the products of the infinitely small quantities so that our equation c becomes sincef f  df f df  4   fdx which developed retaining only terms of the first degree gives f df ff2 dx f d  rdm or simply putting ev  e where e 2e718818

of our equation c which we proceed to examine is that where the surfaces are finite in number and placed close together so as to form a compound lens infinitely thin in the middle In this case we have

now the radiant point to be infinitely distant or Do then willf become the principal reciprocal focal length or power of the system and calling this F we getcompound lenses and objectglasses F k rk r

traversing each separate lens emerges into a va cuum we have p y   c 1  m2 i m3 m1 c and therefore kI k 2 k3 3 i    so that our expression for F becomes FkI trr2  k3 r  r  rc or denoting P 3 c simply by   c F i rr       g In the case of a single lens this reduces itself to its first term and calling L L c the powers of the several lenses we have Ll rr L  i rr4 c h and finally FL  LL c i which expresses that the power of a system of lenses placed close together and infinitely thin is the sum of the powers of its component lenses The powers of concave lenses are here regarded as negative as well as their focal lengths while the equation J shows that the sum of the reciprocal dis tances of the object and its image is equal to the power or reciprocal focal length of the system 6 These propositions are sufficiently well known and comprise the whole theory of the central foci of infinitely MDCCCXXI H h 2s5gS6 Mr J F W HERSCHHt on the aberrations of thin lenses in contact Let us next examine how these re sults will be modified by taking into consideration a small but finite thickness in each of the lenses To this end we may proceed as follows If Uo be any equation of differences involving ff and t where t and its values are so small as to permit their powers and products to be neglected suppose f to be the value off deduced from the equation on the supposition that to then in general we may take ff u where u is a quantity of the same order with t If this be put forf in Uo the equation by developing and rejecting the powers and products of u and t will take the form oVWuX u Y t V W X and Y being functions of f and f and it is evident that V vanishes by reason of the values assigned to these quantities There remains then a linear equation of the first order between u and u which is easily integrated In the case before us we have ufp mf  O which developed becomes J   my mf2t In this writing f u forf and retaining only the terms multiplied by u u and t we get  mu  m f t and integrating Mm M u m3  mn fyt m 3   3m  f22t t    mn f 12tn Hence it is easy to conclude that if we have n lenses placedcompound lenses and objectglasses in contact whose thicknesses are

this equa tion m m m c are the reciprocals of p   c General theory of the aberrations of spherical surfaces for rays incident in the plane of the axis 7 Let us next proceed to investigate the spherical aberra tion of any system of surfaces Suppose the ray after passing through the nth surface to be incident on the n 1t its aberration here will arise from two causes ist that after traversing the n preceding surfaces instead of converging to or diverging from the focus for central rays its direction was really to or from a point in the axis distant from that focus by the total aberration of those n surfaces and 2dly that being incident at a distance from the vertex of the nlth surface a new aberration will be produced here which be ing as well as tle other of small amount the principles of the differential calculus allow us to regard as independent of it and which being computed separately and added to it gives the whole aberration of the system of n1 surfaces s37e38 Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of The same is true of the small alterations in the values off produced by the aberrations If we denote by Sf the change in the value off due to the action of the n preceding surfaces by Yf that due to the action of the n nth and by Af the total change arising from their combined action we shall have Now ist to investigate the partial alteration Yf in the value off arising from the total alteration Af in that off we re sume our equation c and differentiating its first member according to the characteristic  and its second according to A we get f andf being the only variables  ft dly to discover the partial variation Sf of J arising immediately from the action of the n ith surface we have by the equation b writing Sf for Af and m r  Dy re spectively for m r D andy f  m m1  r D  m r im D but in this case neglecting the fourth and higher powers of the semiapertures it is easy to see that yy ft and substituting this fory and  f for D the equation becomes f   m mr rffrtY m r  mf so that uniting the two variations we find Aft l f  2  m lm rffrt m r k If the surfaces be placed close together or to this becomes Antf Y  m r rf2  m r  mf  compound lenses and objectglasses but when this is not the case perhaps it will be found more convenient to use one of the following equations m f  ft  Y lm  f rlm fr m or fitj af  1m  rffrt  rmf m which are derived from it by eliminating t either wholly or partially from the second member by the help of equation c These equations are universally integrable and suffice to assign the aberration in any proposed combination of sphe rical surfaces however placed Theory of the aberrations of infinitely thin lenses placed in contact 8 Confining ourselves at present to this branch of our subject it will easily appear on integrating equation I that where we have Q m  mn r fn mn rn  1  n f in which it will be recollected that the value offo is  D Let us now examine the composition of this function more particularly and first supposing n  the case of a single lens placed in vacuo we have zi m2   and Azf Q Qz If then we write h and m for p and m and make all reduc tions we get Q I m yelm y  mr3   3mr

will be simplified if we recollect that when r  r2 the lens will have no aberration being in this case merely an infinitely thin spherical lamina equally thick in all parts through which all rays pass without deviation Af must consequently vanish when r  r2 and must therefore have r r for a factor so that PQ1Q must be divisible by this without remainder Observing this we get on making the

put Df2 L D and write  for P3 the refractive index of the second lens we must have 3 Q3 4Q Y2 A x L AL B CD C D and similarly for the value of  Qs 6 Q6 adding another accent to the letters in the

If the surfaces of a compound lens be in optical contact i e if the media of which it consists instead of having thin lenses of air or vacuum interposed be contiguous the con vexity of one fitting exactly into the concavity of the other as in the case of two glass lenses inclosing a fluid we may still regard them as separated by infinitely thin nonrefrac tive laminae having equal curvatures on both sides for it is obvious that these will produce no deviation In this case 241x242 Mr J F W ESHEHEL on the aberrations of if the curvatures of the proposed system of surfaces be r r r c those of

aberrations of a compound lens and first of the destruction of the spherical aberration in two lenses of the same medium placed close together with a view to the im provement of magnfiers eyeglasses and burning lenses io The value of Lf in a single lens for parallel rays is represented by I L A If we put for A its value and attempt to make this vanish by assigning a relation between rX and r2 we shall find the roots of the equation imaginary unless the refractive index exceed 4 a case which nature affords no approach to If we would reduce it to its minimum value we find r2 2 m  4 m In

proportion of the curvatures of the surfaces of two thin lenses placed close together it is always possible to adjust their focal lengths so as to produce a combination free from spherical aberration and the same is true if the lenses be formed of different materials To take an example or two suppose the first anid third surfaces on which the light falls to be plane and we have a  a o and consequently h  h o so that the equation X  o becomes 27 X 3 3x213 x 27 7 o whose only real root is x1392 Hence if we take L  i we have L  L  03S So that the power of the compound lens is about  that of the first glass and of an opposite nature which though moderate may not be too low to be of some use If an object be placed in the focus of parallel rays so formed the rays it sends to every part of the surface will emerge rigorously parallel Such an object will therefore be seen by an eye on the other side with as much distinctness as if it were a real object at an infinite distance subtending the same angle and the combination may thus be used as an eye glass or magnifier as well as an objectglass only reversing its position with respect to the eye 1  Let a b b o h  o h I or suppose the first and last surfaces plane and our equation X  o becomes 7 x 163 x13X  27  o which has but one real root x  o08517 or  L 0o8517 L LLx 0 1483 The lenses then must be of opposite characters but the S44compound lenses and objectglasses power of the compound being only about y of that of the first lens is too low to be of service On the same hypothesis as to the plane surfaces if we trace the variation of the function  x we shall find that it admits a minimum for a positive value of x given by the equation 37 x 258 x68  o vIz x 2349 This gives L 235 x L L   335 x L and   o24841 This is the minimum value which the ratio of aberrations ad mits for a positive value of x The combination is repre sented in P1 XIX fig 3 and we see that a very material superiority over the best single lens of the same power is the result of such a disposition the aberration being reduced to less than a fourth part Even if the planoconvex lenses thus laid together be of equal focus the value of  will be only o6co8 indicating still a sensible advantage gained over any single lens 13 Let us however take up the problem more generally and enquire what should be the curvatures of all the four surfaces to destroy the whole aberration in the most advan tageous manner with respect to the power of the resulting combination To this end it is evident that the equation Xo still subsisting we must also have L  L a maxi mum and since we may assume as given the power of the first lens without which the problem is indefinite we have dL  o and dLo whence dxo also diferentiating then the equation Xo on this hypothesis we have 245246 Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of 56h48dh 56h48 49 x2dho the independent parts of which being made to vanish sepa rately we find h  6 ht 6 7 7 7 8x

combinations are represented in P1 XIX figs 4 and 5 Whether we ought or not to aim at the rigorous destruc tion of the aberration of rays parallel to the axis the usecompound lenses and objectglasses to which the lens is to be applied must decide In a burning glass it is of the highest importance A slight consideration will suffice to show that the difference of temperatures pro duced in the foci of a double convex lens of equal radii and one of the same focal length but of the best form must be very considerable In order to try whether even the latter might not be improved by the shortening of the focus and the superior concentration of the exterior rays by applying a correcting lens of one of the forms above calculated in spite of the loss of heat in passing through a second glass I procured two lenses to be figured to the radii assigned in the first column of the foregoing table They were about three inches in aperture and when combined as above directed the aberration was almost totally destroyed and probably would have been so completely had the index of refraction proper to the glass been employed instead of that adopted in our calculation for brevity Their com bined effect as a burning lens appeared to me decidedly superior to that of the first lens used alone and there is there fore good reason to presume that the effect of the other con struction which with the same loss of heat affords a much greater contraction of the focus would be still better and I regret not having tried it in preference 14 In eyeglasses and magnifiers if we would examine a minute object with much attention as a small insect or twhen applied to astronomical purposes if we would scrutinize the appearance of a planet a lunar mountain the nucleus of a comet or a close double star where extent of field is of less consequence than perfect distinctness in the central point too much pains cannot be taken in destroying the central aberra 247248 Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of tion There is another case in which an aplanatic eyeglass should be employed viz in examining the parabolic figure of a speculum or the perfect adjustment of an objectglass If the surface of the speculum or objectglass be divided into concentric annuli by diaphragms covering different parts of it in succession the rays incident on these after crossing in their focus will be spread over corresponding annuli on the surface of the eyeglass and if the distance between the mir ror and eyeglass when adjusted to perfect vision continue the same for all the annuli we conclude that the figure of the speculum is perfect It is so however only with respect to that particular eyeglass and if the aberrations of this be not corrected all the pains of the artist will only produce a mirror affected with proportional and opposite imperfections It is true the use of a very high magntifying power obviates this objection in great measure by confining the aberration of the eyeglass within a narrower compass but it is better in theory and undoubtedly more convenient in practice to an nihilate it altogether The aberration in the eye appears to me to be entirely out of the question here but the considera tion of that point would lead us away from the present sub ject On the other hand when a moderately distinct but exten sive field of view is of more consequence than a perfect but confined one as in spectacles reading glasses magnifiers of moderate power and eyeglasses for certain astronomical purposes the correction of the aberration in the centre of the field may be sacrificed with little inconvenience By far the best periscopic combination I am acquainted with consists of a double convex lens of the best form but placed in its worstcompound lenses and objectglasses position for the lens next the eye and a planoconcave whose focal length is to that of the other as 6  1 or as 135 placed in contact with its flatter surface and having its con cavity towards the object as in P1 XIX fig 6 for the farthest yet for destroying the aberration of rays parallel to the axis nothing can be worse In fact our formula p gives for the aberration in this constructior S2  22309 or about 22 times what the best single lens of equal power would give yet on accidentally combining two such lenses in this manner I was immediately struck with the remarkable extent of oblique vision with the absence of fatigue on read ing some time with a povwer much beyond that of the natural eyeand with the freedom from colour at the edges of the field arising from the opposition of the prismatic refractions of the two solids an advantage which a single meniscus does not possess Theory of objectglasses and first of the destruction of the chro matic aberration or the imperfections arising fromm the different refrangibility of the rays of light 15 The perfection of an objectglass requires that parallel or diverging rays of all colours incident on every point of the glass should converge to one and the same point and con sequently that we should havef invariable and Af zero for all the colours of the spectrum With regard to the latter  The focal length of the compound lens tried was 84 inch the field of tole rably distinct vision extended full 40 from the axis and the forms of objects were distinguishable the letters of a book might be reac with management as far as the 75th degree The lenses used in this combination should be very thin and the eye applied as close as possible 49Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of condition we may content ourselves as already remarked with annihilating A for the most luminous rays but the former must be satisfied as rigorously as possible To fix the colour of a ray we may either fix its position in a spec trum cast by a prism of a standard substance or the length of its fits of easy transmission and reflexion in vacuo The latter method is on all accounts preferable The whole dif ference then between the lengths of the fits of an extreme red and violet ray being taken for unity let c be difference between those of a ray of any assumed colour and those of the most luminous ray in the spectrum c being positive for rays nearer the red end of the spectrum and negative for those nearer the violet Then in different media the refrac tive indices h p c for that colour will be functions of c of a form depending on the nature of the media and which per haps is not the same for any two media in nature What this form is in any one medium is at present altogether unknown but in all we may represent it by    PC   c p being the quantity usually termed the dispersive power of the medium and which even in the most dispersive bodies hitherto observed does not exceed o4 and is generally a very small fraction while q r c are numerical coefficients whose influence was perceived shortly after the discovery of the different dispersive powers of bodies by CLAIRAUT and whose real existence the experiments of BLAIR BREWSTER c seem to have placed beyond a doubt The presumption is that they decrease rapidly in magnitude and are altogether insensible in the higher terms of the series 25ocompound lenses and objectglasses Let this assumed value of the refractive index be put for p in our equation f pA rr  li r4  c D and similar values for p i Cc and we get fJ p r1r  I r3r4  CD  c P

remain the same for rays of all colours it must be verified independent of any particular value assigned to c a condition which gives o I  Lp L  c o Lq L qt Lq  r c  These equations being infinite in number while the number of the quantities LL 8c is limited it is of course impossible to satisfy them all by any adaptation of the latter quantities but as q  8c decrease rapidly we may confine ourselves to satisfy one or two of the first as the others can produce but  It were to be wished that in physical optics the most luminous rays were always employed as the term of comparison The mean or middle ray of the spectrum varies in every different medium and has no distinguishing property which renders it sus ceptible of exact determination while the others by their presence or absence unim formly mark the maxima and minima of optical phanomena MDCCCXXI K k 251Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of an insensible change in the value off especially since the greatest value of c very little exceeds 2 Opticians usually regard only the coefficients pp c which represent the dispersive powers and the first of our equations r which assigns a relation among the powers of the lenses of a very simple nature has in general been the only one resorted to to insure the achromaticity of the sys tem It has long however been a subject of complaint that however perfectly the foci of a double objectglass be adjusted to unite the extreme rays of the spectrum a more or less considerable quantity of uncorrected colour remains which cannot be destroyed by such adjustment This is obviously owing to the nonproportionality of the quantities of p q r in different media which renders it impossible to satisfy more than the first of the equations r or to what is termed the irrationality of the coloured spaces in the spectra and the attention of the optical philosopher has for some tinie past been turned to the discovery of media in which either this defect of proportionality shall be imperceptible or else so considerable as to admit a more perfect correction by the use of three lenses of different media so adjusted as to satisfy two of the equations As the coefficients q r c furnish equations exactly similar to those afforded by p it would not be amiss were they designated in future by the epithet of dispersive powers of the 2d 3d and superior orders and were each medium regarded as having its own peculiar system of dispersive powers of all orders to infinity according to the values of p q r c It is almost superfluous to remark on the very interesting field of experimental enquiry which this view lays open in which however little progress can be ex 523compound lenses and objectglasses 253 pected till more rigorous means have been devised of insula ting the different homogeneous rays so as to secure their absolute identity at all times and under all circumstances a subject to which I have already devoted some attention and not altogether without success 16 In the choice of media then for a double objectglass we must be directed by the condition that their dispersive powers of the first order shall differ considerably The equation o Lp  Lp the only one we can satisfy rigorously in this case gives L P L p indicating that the lenses must be of opposite characters and having their focal lengths in the direct ratio of their disper sions If we call I the power of the compound lens and take z t the ratio of the dispersions we get L  1   Ia1s We have then only one farther guide to direct us in our choice of media viz that the dispersive powers of superior orders shall follow as nearly as possible the same propor tion in both media as those of the first 17 In triple objectglasses we have o Lp Lp L p o  L q  Lq L q and  L  L L whence we obtain

where y is the semiaperture or distance of the point of the first surface on which the ray falls from the axis In order then that this may be rigorously the same for rays incident on every point of the surface this must be independent of y and of course we must have N  O o P o c In ordinary telescopes however y is sufficiently small to ad mit of our neglecting its fourth and higher powers with

where S T U are functions of the curvatures and powers of the lenses Now as the telescope may be directed to objects at all different distances D is arbitrary and independent and in consequence the

determine from other conditions the powers L L c the equation takes a form of great sim plicity Now as we have already seen the destruction of the chromatic aberration depends on relations between the focal lengths only without any regard to the curvatures of the surfaces and therefore furnishes equations tending to this very point It is a singular circumstance and it cannot but be regarded as a very fortunate one that the introduction ofcompound lenses and objectglasses another condition quite independent of the correction of the spherical aberration and which at first sight seems likely greatly to increase the difficulty of the investigation should on the contrary tend so remarkably to simplify it In general when the focal lengths are assumed there will be as many unknown quantities r r c as there are lenses and the aberration for parallel rays may therefore be de stroyed in a great variety of ways some more some less advantageous If for example we limit the figure of one of the lenses in any way as if we assume it planoconvex or concave or assign equal curvatures to both its surfaces c such limitation is equivalent to assigning given values to both its radii and the terms depending on that lens in equa tion w pass into the given part of the equation 20 Let us next consider the equations u and v The latter does not involve the radii of the lenses but only their powers

 Unless such a peculiar adjustment of the media should take place as to render the two conditions identical which would give P P or   zm3  z23 3 2z 3 2 It is a mere matter of curiosity to look for media satisfying this equation Fluor spar combined with rock crystal comes very near it but among bodies adapted for objectglasses there are probably none to be found except such as would result from mixtures of different liquids 257Mr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of of the same order with the powers and curvatures of the glasses it may be a matter of some moment 21 The equation u being

within the most considerable limits If we combine the least dispersive flint with the most dispersive crown or plate glass which have yet been observed by DOLLOND BOSCOVICH ROBISON BREWSTER c and vice versa we shall find o051 and 0782 for the minimum and maximum of this quantity but it is rare to meet with the extremes Mr TULLEY was so good as to communicate to me the highest and lowest dispersions of the two sorts of glass which had occurred to him in the e258compound lenses and objectglasses course of his practice and calculating on these I find o56915 and o65617 for the corresponding values of i so that we may fairly take 0o60 for its average value With regard to I and p their limits are much narrower In crown and plate glass we have 15o4 and 1i544 for the extreme indices while in flint 15735 and 1625 are the lowest and highest I have met with any account of TULLEYS extremes are 15735 and 1599 and it is said to be very rare at present to meet with flint higher than i6oo In one specimen only have I observed a greater refraction We may therefore fix on 1524 and 1585 for the mean or average values of pw and p In order however to embrace a greater range of tile function should we be desirous of interpolating as well as to provide for the possible discovery of a mode of making flint glass of high dispersive power free from veins a thing which it seems very reasonable to hope and which the recent liberality of Government in affording facilities to experiments on a large scale for this express purpose gives us some ground to expect I have computed the coefficients of our

is necessary 25 This table and the preceding afford room for one or two remarks of some motenit And first with regard to theMr J F W HERSCHEL on the aberrations of putting together of the lenses it will be observed that for the lower values of  or the more dispersive varieties of flint glass the curvature of the third surface is a very little greater than that of the second so that the glasses when laid together in their proper position will have a minute interval between them At a certain value of a between 0o55 and o6Go o58 nearly this interval vanishes and the glasses are in contact over their whole surface For higher dispersive ratios if laid close together they would touch in the vertex This is regarded as an objection in practice and justly espe cially when the curvatures of the surfaces in contact differ considerably as their pressure on each other at the centre must tend to distort their figures and disturb the uniformity of their density not to speak of the production of the colours of thin plates whose effect on vision is more problematic But in fact the difference of the curvatures in this construc tion is so very trifling as to fall within the limits of practical errors and therefore if the separation of the two glasses by a ring of metal which in a o1 feet objectglass of 5 inches aperture even in the very unfavourable case of so7o need not exceed i4ooth of an inch in thickness be deemed un advisable it may be neglected and the glasses ground to the same radius provided only the necessary alterations are made in the other surfaces to preserve the proper proportion of their focal lengths 26 With regard to the interpolation of the tables above given for intermediate values of ar if we cast our eyes down the second and 5th columns we cannot but be struck by the very small alteration in the values of r and r4 the curvatures of the first and last surfaces throughout the whole useful 263compound lenses and objectglasses extent of the table i e as far as o7o beyond which it is very unlikely it should ever extend in practice In fact these values have the one a maximum and the other a mini mum between ro55 and aro6o The principal variation takes place on the values of r and r  which change rapidly as ar increases the whole stress of the adjustment by which the aberration is corrected being laid on these surfaces We may take advantage of this fortunate and very remarkable circumstance and assigning to r and r constant values such as to give the least average error employ them to complete the interior curvatures thus we may announce it as a prac tical theorem which in all probability will be found suffi ciently exact for use that a double objectglass will be free from aberration provided the radius of the exterior surface of the crown lens be 672o0 and of the flint 1 420 the focal length of the com bination being l ocoo and the radii f the interior surfaces being computed from these data by the formula given in all elementary works on optics so as to make the focal lengths of the two glasses in the direct ratio of their dispersive pozers 27 It remains to examine the effect of a change of the values of  and 1 on the curvatures Now the variations to which these quantities are subject being very trifling we may neglect their squares and products and we shall have dr drdr dr where ar and d are constant coeflicients which are most readily computed by repeating the preceding calculations for values of t and p a little differing from those before assumed And first with respect to d if we take  1i 5o4 and 4d 26364A Mr J F W

refractive power of the flint lens are much smaller than those produced by an alteration in that of the crown which is another fortunate circumstance the crown and plate glass usually met with being much more uniform in this respect than the flint JOHN F W HERSCHEL Slougb Feb i9 I 8z2 MDCCCXX1 M 1m

demonstrated how it is sought to avoid the mechanical operation of legal rules in our administration of criminal justice by a series of devices introduc ing the element of discretion A judges assertion of discretionary power in a situation which the Deans enumeration does not include raises an interesting problem2 An application was made for leave to file informations under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act The ap plication disclosed a prima facie violation of the regulations Leave to file the informations was denied the court saying that Each and all of them informations are too trivial to warrant setting in motion the elaborate and ponderous machinery of this Federal Court to try them 3 1 See RoscoE POUND CRIMINAL JUSTICE IN THE AMERICAN CITY 10 II These devices include the dispensing power exercised at different stages and in varying degrees by police prosecutingattorneys grandjuries and petit juries There must be added judicial discretion as to sentence or suspension or mitigation of sentence administrative parole or probation and executive pardon 2 Irs re Informations under Migratory Bird Treaty Act 28i Fed 546 548 D Mont I922 For the facts of this case see RECENT CASES infra p 2I9 3 In re Informations under Migratory Bird Treaty Act supra at 549NOTES 205 The proceeding by information in the Kings name in criminal cases is said to be as old as the common law itself4 Informations according to Blackstone were brought either ex officio by the Attorney General in the Kings own suits or were filed by the Master of the CrownOffice in the Court of Kings Bench in cases where the King was the nominal prosecutor on the relation of some informer5 Hawkins 6 says that in fact all misdemeanors but not capital crimes or misprision of treason could be prosecuted by the informa tion either of the Attorney General or the Master of the Crown Office At common law informations were merely the accusation of these officers who were perfectly free in bringing them The law was modified by an early statute 7 which in effect required the Master of the CrownOffice to procure leave of court to file an in formation8 The statute did not attempt to define the courts dis cretion in granting such leave but under it the judges power to deny leave even in face of a prima facie case for prosecution was quite broad9 The statute did not attempt to limit indeed ex pressly excepted from its operation the ex ogicio information As well after the passing of this statute as before the Attorney General had a right to file informations merely on his oath of office and with out court leave0 In our state courts informations were used at an early day They were later resorted to in the federal courts2 although but rarely until recent times And the weight of authority is that it is the ex ogicio information which prevails in our law3 Subject to constitutional and statutory limitations and changes the prerogative of the English Attorney General is vested in our prose cuting attorneys In the courts of the United States the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution clearly prohibits the prosecution by information of capital or infamous crimes4 It is equally clear under the Fourth 4See BLACKSTONE COMMENTARIEs Bk IV 309 5Ibid at 308 6See 2 HAWKINS PLEAS OF THE CROWN C 26  I 3 7See 4  5 WM  MA c i8 I692 8 The practice under this act was to grant leave only

issuance of a warrant of arrest probable cause must be shown to the magis trate and he must pass judgment on its sufficiency5 But it is not easily perceived as it has been contended6 that this Amendment changes the character of the information Unless a warrant is asked it has no application7 A construction of the Fourth Amendment to give the court a discretion in the filing of all informations is there fore impossible However informations in the federal courts proceed in form at least with leave of court although as a matter of practice in some districts it is an assumed rather than an actual leave8 It is doubtless in part this formal application for leave that explains denials of the prosecutors right and assertions of judicial discretion in the matter9 For such statements no support has been found in the Constitution the Acts of Congress nor in the common law precedents The English cases 20 which might seem to support such a view were not cases begun by ex officio information and seem also to have been governed by a special statutory provision2 However there is much to be said for the position taken by the court in the principal case A great volume of new legislation has flooded the district courts with litigation22 Every consideration of policy demands relief from this unparalleled situation As matters stand in a class of cases to which the principal case belongs a bureau official two thousand miles away perhaps has the discretion to prosecute or no It is certainly preferable that the judge should say whether the courts valuable time may be spared to try some petty offender But this situation probably could be remedied more specifically by the creation of federal police courts with jurisdiction by imprisonment at hard labor it seems the crime is infamous Ex parte Wilson II4 U S 4I7 I884 Mackin v United States II7 U S 348 I885 Cf United States v Moreland 42 Sup Ct Rep 368 I922 See i9i6 U S ComP STAT ANN  IO 509 15 6   no Warrants shall

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109619,A THIRD SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ON AN ARTIFICIAL SUBSTANCE WHICH POSSESSES THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN WITH SOME REMARKS ON COAL ABSTRACT,I207043,220 SERVES THAT LUXURIANT SHOOTS WHICH ABOUND IN SAP CONSTANTLY TURN UPWARDS AND ENDEAVOUR TO ACQUIRE A PERPENDICULAR DIRECTION BUT THAT THE FEEBLE AND MORE SLENDER SHOOTS GROW IN ALMOST EVERY DIREC TION PROBABLY FROM THEIR FIBRES BEING MORE DRY AND THEIR VESSELS LESS AMPLY SUPPLIED WITH SAP SO THAT THEY ARE LESS AFFECTED BY GRAVITATION TO THE SECOND OBJECTION MR KNIGHT ANSWERS THAT THE COMPRESSION OF THE RADICLE AS IT PENETRATES THE SOIL OBSTRUCTS THE MOTION OF THE SAP AND OCCASIONS THE GENERATION OF NUMEROUS LATERAL ROOTS AND AS THEIR SUBSTANCE IS LESS SUCCULENT THAN THAT OF THE RADICLE FIRST EMITTED THEY ARE LESS OBEDIENT TO GRAVITATION AND CONSEQUENTLY EXTEND HORI ZONTALLY IN EVERY DIRECTION RESPECTING THE TAPROOT OF THE OAK THE AUTHOR SAYS HE HAS EXAMINED AT LEAST 20000 TREES OF THAT SPECIES AND NEVER FOUND ONE TREE THAT POSSESSED A TAPROOT HE THEREFORE THINKS HE MAY BE ALLOWED TO DOUBT THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A ROOT A THIRD SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ON AN ARTIFICIAL SUBSTANCE WHICH POS SESSES THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN  WITH SOME REMARKS ON COAL BY CHARLES HATCHETT ESQ FRS READ JA NUARY 16 1806 PHIL TRANS 1806 P 109 MR HATCHETT IN HIS FORMER COMMUNICATIONS ON THIS SUBJECT GAVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY SULPHURIC ACID UPON TURPEN TINE RESIN AND CAMPHOR HE NOW STATES THE RESULTS OF A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THAT ACID UPON A GREAT NUMBER OF RESINS BALSAMS GUMRESINS AND GUMS FROM WHICH IT APPEARS THAT SUL PHURIC ACID ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED THE RESINS FORMING TRANSPA RENT BROWN SOLUTIONS WHICH GRADUALLY BECAME BLACK THAT THE SOLU TIONS OF THE BALSAMS AND OF GUAIACUM WERE AT FIRST OF A DEEP CRIMSON COLOUR SLIGHTLY INCLINING TO BROWN AND THAT CAOUTCHOUC AND ELASTIC BITUMEN WERE NOT DISSOLVED BUT AFTER A LONG DIGESTION WERE ONLY SUPERFICIALLY CARBONIZED TURPENTINE COMMON RESIN ELEMI TUCAMAHACA MASTIC COPAIBA COPAL CAMPHOR BENZOIN THE BALSAMS OF TOLU AND OF PERU ASSAFCE TIDA AND AMBER YIELDED A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE SO ALSO DID OIL OF TURPENTINE ASPHALTUM YIELDED ONLY A SMALL PORTION OF THAT SUBSTANCE AND SOME SLIGHT TRACES OF IT WERE OBTAINED FROM GUM ARABIC AND FROM GUM TRAGACANTH BUT NONE WAS PRODUCED FROM GUAIACUM DRAGONS BLOOD MYRRH GUM AMMONIAC OLIBANUM GAMBOGE CAOUTCHOUC ELASTIC BITUMEN LIQUORICE AND MANNA MR HATCHETT THINKS HOW EVER THAT SOME OF THESE WOULD HAVE YIELDED IT HAD NOT THE DIGESTION WITH NITRIC ACID BEEN TOO LONG CONTINUED OLIVE OIL WAS PARTLY CONVERTED INTO THE TANNING SUBSTANCE SO ALSO WERE LINSEED OIL WAX AND ANIMAL FAT IN THE EXPERIMENT WITH LIN SEED OIL A PORTION WAS LEFT UNDISSOLVED THIS PORTION APPEARED TO RETAIN MANY OF THE PROPERTIES OF AN INSPISSATED FAT OIL IN THE EX PERIMENT MADE WITH WAX A WHITE SUBSTANCE WAS OBTAINED WHICH WAS FOUND TO POSSESS THE PROPERTIES OF SPERMACETI IN THAT WITH ANIMAL FAT IN WHICH THE KIDNEYFAT OF VEAL WAS EMPLOYED A GREAT221 PORTION OF A GRAYISHBLACK SUBSTANCE WAS PRODUCED WHICH WAS HIGHLY INFLAMMABLE WAS EASILY MELTED AND WAS READILY DISSOLVED IN COLD ALCOHOL FROM WHICH LIKE THE RESINS IT MIGHT BE PRECIPITATED BY WATER FROM COAGULATED ALBUMEN AND FROM PREPARED MUSCULAR FIBRE NO THING BUT COAL COULD BE OBTAINED IN THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS THERE APPEARED TO BE A CERTAIN PERIOD OF THE PROCESS WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE ARRIVED AT ITS MAXIMUM AFTER WHICH A GRADUAL DIMINUTION AND AT LENGTH A TOTAL DESTRUCTION OF IT TOOK PLACE AND IT BECAME MERE COAL SOME EXPERIMENTS ARE NOW RELATED MADE WITH NITRIC ACID ON THE ELASTIC BITUMEN AND ON SEVERAL KINDS OF COAL THE RESULT WAS THAT FROM ELASTIC BITUMEN COMMON PITCOAL CANNELCOAL AND ASPHALTUM THERE WAS OBTAINED NOT ONLY THE TANNING SUBSTANCE BUT ALSO ANOTHER SUBSTANCE WHICH POSSESSED PROPERTIES INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THOSE OF RESIN AND THOSE OF VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER BUT THIS SUBSTANCE MIGHT BY DIGESTION IN NITRIC ACID BE CONVERTED INTO THE TANNING SUB STANCE FROM KILKENNYCOAL AND FROM TWO OTHER KINDS OF COAL ONE FROM WALES THE OTHER FROM NORTH AMERICA NONE OF THE ABOVEMEN TIONED RESINOUS SUBSTANCES WERE OBTAINED MR HATCHETT NOW PROCEEDS TO MENTION A VARIETY OF EXPERIMENTS MADE ON HORSECHESTNUTS AND ON THEIR PEELS FROM THESE IT APPEARED THAT THE SMALL PORTION OF TANNIN ORIGINALLY CONTAINED IN HORSECHEST NUT PEELS IS DESTROYED BY THE PROCESS OF ROASTING BUT THAT THE BROWN DECOCTIONS OF THE ROASTED HORSECHESTNUTS AND OF THEIR PEELS MIGHT BE MADE TO AFFORD THE TANNIN MATTER BY THE ADDITION OF NITRIC ACID THE ABOVE BROWN DECOCTIONS APPEARED TO CONTAIN CARBON COMBINED WITH OXYGEN SUFFICIENT TO GIVE IT MANY OF THE PROPERTIES OF COAL BUT THE COMPOUND IS NEVERTHELESS CAPABLE OF BEING DISSOLVED BY WATER WITH GREAT FACILITY SOLUTIONS SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE MAY OUR AUTHOR THINKS BE OBTAINED WHENEVER VEGETABLE MATTER UNDERGOES THE PUTREFACTIVE PROCESS AS IN DUNGHILLS C HE EXAMINED THE BROWN LIQUOR THAT RUNS FROM WALNUT PEELS WHEN KEPT IN A HEAP FOR A CERTAIN TIME AND FOUND THAT LIKE THE DECOCTIONS ABOVE MENTIONED IT CONTAINED CARBON IN A STATE AP PROACHING TO COAL AND THAT BY THE ADDITION OF NITRIC ACID A SMALL PORTION OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE MIGHT BE PROCURED FROM IT SOME EXPERIMENTS WERE LIKEWISE MADE UPON GALLS THE RESULTS OF WHICH SHOWED THAT THE NATURAL TANNIN CONTAINED IN THEM IS DESTROYED BY NITRIC ACID THAT IT IS ALSO DIMINISHED AND ULTIMATELY DESTROYED BY ROASTING BUT WHEN THE GALLS HAVE NOT BEEN SO MUCH ROASTED AS TO DESTROY THE WHOLE OF THE TANNIN THE REMAINDER OF THAT SUBSTANCE IS DESTROYED BY THE ADDITION OF NITRIC ACID WHILST AT THE SAME TIME A SMALL PORTION OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNIN IS PRODUCED RESULTS NEARLY SIMILAR WERE OBTAINED FROM EXPERIMENTS UPON OAK BARK AND IT ALSO APPEARED THAT WHEN THAT BARK WAS EXHAUSTED OF ITS NATURAL TANNIN IT MIGHT BY ROASTING AND BEING TREATED WITH NITRIC ACID BE MADE TO YIELD THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE THIS PROCESS WAS SEVERAL TIMES REPEATED UPON THE SAME PORTION OF BARK AND AS IT222 STILL CONTINUED TO YIELD THE TANNING SUBSTANCE OUR AUTHOR THINKS IT PROBABLE THE PROCESS MIGHT BE REPEATED UNTIL THE WHOLE OF THE BARK BECAME CONVERTED INTO THE ABOVE SUBSTANCE FROM THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS AND MANY OTHERS MADE BY HIM MR HATCHETT THINKS THAT THE METHOD OF TREATING ROASTED VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES HERE DESCRIBED IS THE MOST SPEEDY AND ECONOMICAL FOR OBTAINING THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING MATTER AND AS ALL REFUSE VEGETABLES MAY BE THUS CONVERTED INTO THAT MATTER BY SIMPLE AND UNEXPENSIVE MEANS HE HOPES THE DISCOVERY MAY EVENTUALLY BE PRODUCTIVE OF SOME REAL PUBLIC ADVANTAGE IN A FORMER PAPER MR HATCHETT OBSERVED THAT HE SUSPECTED THE TANNIN FOUND IN SOME PEATMOORS WAS PRODUCED DURING THE IMPERFECT CARBONIZATION OF THE ORIGINAL VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES WHETHER THAT IS REALLY THE CASE OR WHETHER IT HAS BEEN AFFORDED BY HEATH OR OTHER VEGETABLES GROWING UPON AND NEAR THE PEAT IS HE SAYS STILL UNCER TAIN AS HE HAS NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DETECT ANY TANNING SUBSTANCE IN PEAT ALTHOUGH HE HAS EXAMINED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF VARIETIES OF IT THE GREAT FACILITY WITH WHICH TANNIN IS DISSOLVED BY WATER CAUSES IT TO BE SPEEDILY EXTRACTED AND DRAINED FROM THE SUBSTANCES WHICH AT FIRST CONTAINED IT AND THAT THIS FACILITY OF EXTRACTION EX TENDS TO THE MOST SOLID VEGETABLE BODIES IS SHOWN BY AN EXPERIMENT MADE BY OUR AUTHOR ON A PIECE OF OAK FROM THE SUBMERGED FOREST AT SUTTON ON THE COAST OF LINCOLNSHIRE DESCRIBED IN THE PHIL TRANS FOR THE YEAR 1799 THIS OAK BY DECOCTION AFFORDED EXTRACTIVE MATTER BUT NO TRACES OF TANNIN COULD BE PERCEIVED YET BY INCINERATION IT EVEN AFFORDED POTASH PEAT HOWEVER ALTHOUGH IT DOES NOT CONTAIN TANNIN IS BY THE IM PERFECT CARBONIZATION IT HAS UNDERGONE RENDERED CAPABLE OF BEING CONVERTED BY TREATMENT WITH NITRIC ACID INTO THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE IN THE MANNER ALREADY MENTIONED WITH RESPECT TO ROASTED LIGNEOUS BODIES IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION OF HIS PAPER MR HATCHETT COMPARES THE EFFECT OF THE ACETIC SULPHURIC AND NITRIC ACIDS UPON RESINOUS SUB STANCES THE FIRST OF THESE HE CONSIDERS AS THE SOLVENT OF SUCH SUB STANCES AS IT DISSOLVES THEM SPEEDILY WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY APPARENT SUBSEQUENT CHANGE IN THEIR NATURAL PROPERTIES SO THAT BY PROPER PRECIPITANTS THEY MAY BE SEPARATED FROM THAT ACID IN AN UNALTERED STATE SULPHURIC ACID IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES RESINOUS SUBSTANCES BUT THE MOMENT THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETE PROGRESSIVE ALTERATIONS AP PEAR TO TAKE PLACE IN THE DISSOLVED SUBSTANCE COAL BEING THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT THE EFFECTS OF NITRIC ACID SEEM TO BE THE REVERSE OF THOSE OF THE SULPHURIC FOR BY NITRIC ACID THE RESINS ARE CONVERTED INTO A BRITTLE POROUS SUBSTANCE THEN INTO A SOLUBLE PRODUCT INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN EXTRACTIVE MATTER AND RESIN WHICH PRODUCT IS CONVERTED INTO THE FIRST VARIETY OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE BEYOND WHICH OUR AUTHOR HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO EFFECT ANY CHANGE A TABLE OF THE QUAN TITY OF COAL REMAINING AFTER THE TREATMENT OF VARIOUS RESINOUS SUB STANCES WITH SULPHURIC ACID IS NOW GIVEN RESPECTING WHICH WE SHALL223 ONLY REMARK THAT A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION OF COAL IS OBTAINED FROMN THOSE SUBSTANCES BY MEANS OF THE ABOVE ACID THAN CAN BE OBTAINED BY DISTILLATION TWO EXPERIMENTS ON THE HUMID FORMATION OF COAL ARE ALSO DE SCRIBED FROM ONE OF THESE IT APPEARS THAT OAKWOOD MAY BY SUL PHURIC ACID BE CONVERTED INTO A COAL WHICH IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM CHARCOAL AND WHICH BY ITS MODE OF BURNING AND BY ITS NOT AFFORDING ANY ALKALI RESEMBLES THOSE MINERAL COALS THAT DO NOT CONTAIN BITU MEN THE OTHER EXPERIMENT SHOWS THAT OAKWOOD MAY ALSO BE CONVERTED INTO A SORT OF COAL BY MURIATIC ACID BUT THIS COAL RETAINS SOME VEGE TABLE CHARACTERS ALTHOUGH NO ALKALI CAN BE OBTAINED FROM ITS ASHES MR HATCHETT NOW PROCEEDS TO MAKE SOME REMARKS ON THE NATURAL FORMATION OF COAL AFTER STATING THE VARIOUS THEORIES THAT HAVE BEEN FORMED ON THAT SUBJECT HE CONSIDERS AS THE MOST PROBABLE THE THEORY WHICH ASCRIBES THE PRINCIPAL ORIGIN OF COAL TO VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES THAT IDEA OF ITS ORIGIN BEING HE SAYS CORROBORATED BY THE GREATER NUMBER OF GEOLOGICAL FACTS THE OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER THAT HAVE BEEN MADE UPON THE SUBMERGED WOOD FOUND AT SUTTON AND OTHER PLACES SHOW OUR AUTHOR THINKS THAT VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES BURIED UNDER THE SEA OR UNDER THE EARTH ARE NOT MERELY BY SUCH MEANS CONVERTED EVEN INTO THE MOST IMPERFECT SORT OF COAL SOME OTHER PROCESS BEING EVIDENTLY NECESSARY TO PRODUCE THIS CHANGE WHICH IN A FORMER PAPER HE ENDEAVOURED TO DEMONSTRATE TO BE PROGRESSIVE  THAT SOME SORTS OF COAL ARE OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN THERE CANNOT MR HATCHETT SAYS BE ANY DOUBT SEVERAL OF THEM AS THE BOVEY COAL THE SUSSEX COAL THE SURTURBRAND C NOT ONLY STILL RETAIN SOME OF THEIR EXTERNAL VEGETABLE CHARACTERS BUT ALSO YIELD RESINA SUBSTANCE ALLOWED TO BELONG EXCLUSIVELY TO ORGANIZED NATURAL BODIES SOME MINERALOGISTS HOWEVER HAVE ATTEMPTED TO DISTINGUISH THE ABOVE MENTIONED COALS FROM OTHERS WHICH THEY DENOMINATE TRUE MINERAL COALS BUT IT HAS IN THE FORMER PART OF THIS PAPER BEEN SHOWN THAT WHEN PITCOAL CANNELCOAL AND ASPHALTUM WHICH ARE CONSIDERED AS OF MINERAL ORIGIN ARE SUBJECTED TO THE ACTION OF NITRIC ACID AND THE PROCESS IS STOPPED AT A PROPER PERIOD THERE REMAINS A SUBSTANCE WHICH IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN RESIN AND VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER IT HAS ALSO BEEN STATED THAT BY SIMILAR MEANS A SUBSTANCE POSSESSING NEARLY THE SAME PROPERTIES MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE KNOWN VEGETABLE RESINS OUR AUTHOR INDEED ADMITS THAT BITUMEN HAS NEVER BEEN FORMED BY ANY ARTIFICIAL PROCESS AND THAT HE HAS HIMSELF ATTEMPTED IT IN VARIOUS WAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS YET WE MAY CONCLUDE FROM WHAT HAS BEEN ALREADY SAID THAT BITUMEN IS A MODIFICATION OF THE RESINOUS AND OILY PARTS OF VEGETABLES PRODUCED BY SOME PROCESS OF NATURE OPERATED BY GRADUAL MEANS ON IMMENSE MASSES AND WE HAVE HE THINKS GREAT REASON TO CONCLUDE THAT THE AGENT EMPLOYED BY NATURE IN THE FORMA TION OF COAL AND BITUMEN IS EITHER THE MURIATIC OR THE SULPHURIC ACID COMMON SALT HOWEVER IS NEVER FOUND IN COALMINES EXCEPT WHEN THEY ARE IN THE VICINITY OF SALTSPRINGS  WHILST ON THE CONTRARY PYRITES SULPHATE OF IRON AND ALUM ARE COMMONLY FOUND IN SUCH MINES  FROM WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES TOGETHER WITH THE SULPHUREOUS ODOUR EMITTED BY MOST OF THE MINERAL COALS WHEN BURNED THE AGENCY OF SULPHURIC ACID IS STRONGLY EVINCED AND AS WE HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED THE COALS FORMED ARTIFICIALLY FROM VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES BY MEANS OF SULPHURIC ACID BEAR A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THE MINERAL COALS NOT ONLY IN THEIR EXTERNAL CHARACTERS BUT ALSO IN THEIR OTHER PROPERTIES MR HATCHETT INTENDS HE SAYS TO RELINQUISH ANY FURTHER PROSECU TION OF THIS SUBJECT FOR THE PRESENT BUT HE ENTERTAINS SUCH SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS OF ITS PROVING ECONOMICALLY USEFIL THAT HE STRONGLY RE COMMENDS THE PROSECUTION OF THE INQUIRY PARTICULARLY OF THAT PART WHICH RELATES TO ROASTED VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES AND TO PEAT THE APPLICATION OF A METHOD OF DIFFERENCES TO THE SPECIES OF SERIES WHOSE SUMS ARE OBTAINED BY MR LANDEN BY THE HELP OF IMPOSSIBLE QUANTITIES BY MR BENJAMIN GOMPERTZ COMMUNICATED BY THE REV NEVIL MASKELYNE DD ASTRONOMER ROYAL FRS READ FEBRUARY 13 1806 PHIL TRANS 1806 P 147 THE NATURE OF THIS PAPER IS SUCH AS RENDERS IT ABSOLUTELY INCAPABLE OF ABRIDGEMENT BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION TO IT THE AUTHOR OBSERVES THAT HAVING SOME YEARS BACK WHEN READING THE LEARNED MR LANDENS FIFTH MEMOIR DISCOVERED THE MANNER OF APPLYING A METHOD OF DIFFER ENCES TO THE SPECIES OF SERIES WHOSE SUMS ARE THERE OBTAINED BY THE HELP OF IMPOSSIBLE QUANTITIES AND HAVING SINCE EXTENDED THAT APPLI CATION HE NOW VENTURES TO OFFER IT TO THE CONSIDERATION OF OTHERS THE PRACTICE OF THIS METHOD IN MOST CASES APPEARS HE SAYS EX TREMELY SIMPLE AND ON THAT ACCOUNT HE IS ALMOST INDUCED TO IMAGINE THAT IT HAS ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERED BY MATHEMATICIANS AND HE AC KNOWLEDGES THAT SINCE THE GREATEST PART OF THE PAPER WAS WRITTEN HE HAS IN EULERS INSTITUTIONES CALCULI INTEGRALIS MET WITH TWO SIMPLE SERIES WHICH ARE IN THAT WORK SUMMED BY MULTIPLICATIONS SIMILAR TO THOSE EMPLOYED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE PRINCIPAL THEO REMS CONTAINED IN THIS PAPER BUT WHETHER THAT LEARNED MATHEMA TICIAN HAS PURSUED THE METHOD ANY FURTHER HE HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO ASCERTAIN MR GOMPERTZ HAS PURPOSELY CONSIDERED SOME OF THE SERIES SUMMED BY MR LANDEN IN ORDER TO PROCURE AN OPPORTUNITY OF COMPARING BOTH THE RESULTS AND METHODS AND AS THE SERIES MAY HAVE PARTICULAR CASES IN WHICH BOTH MR LANDENS MEANS AND THOSE OF OUR AUTHOR FAIL HE HAS ADDED TOWARDS THE END A GENERAL SCHOLIUM CONCERNING THE CAUSES CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH FAILURE AN ACCOUNT OF A SMALL LOBE OF THE HUMAN PROSTATE GLAND WHICH HAS NOT BEFORE BEEN TAKEN NOTICE OF BY ANATOMISTS BY EVERARD HOME ESQ FRS READ FEBRUARY 20 1806 PHIL TRANS 1806 P 195 THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER IS A PORTION OF A GLAND WHICH FROM THE SMALLNESS OF ITS SIZE AND THE OBSCURITY OF ITS SITUATION HAS HITHERTO

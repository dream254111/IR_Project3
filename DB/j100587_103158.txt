Fig 4 NV An Account of Experiments concerning the Pro portion of the Power of the Loadstone at different Distances By Mr Fr Hauksbee F R S WIthout mentioning the many Difficulties that at tend the making of Experiments of this Nature I shall immediately give an Account of their Success and the manner of proceeding which was as follows Itook a Quadrant of 4 Feet Radius and having fixd it to the Floor in the Position of the Needle whose South507 South Point directed itself to no Degrees I then fixd a Board likewise on the Floor in a direct Angle from from the same the Graduations on which Board were 3 Inches distant from each other The Needle was suspended on a Point arising from the Center of the Quadrant from whence were measured the several Sta tions of the Magnet The Magnet was laid on a thin piece of Board under which to one side was naild a narrow slip of Wood to slide it along the side of the forementiond graduated Board whereby the Stone might be always kept in the same Direction to the Needle The Stone that I used weighed about six Pounds was rough and of an irregular Figure yet I could discover no Inconveniency in the Experiment ari sing from the same it being and acting at all Distances in the same Position as it is first placd on the Board And I see no reason to doubt but the Proportions of its Power will be regular and agreeable to the several Distances as more than once I have observd For when the Stone hath been differently posited on the foremen tioned thin board different Angles of the Needle would ensue at the same Stations yet their Proportions one to another would be nearly the same My meaning is this Suppose the Stone was so placd as at 3 Inches from the Needle it would give the Needle an Angle of 90 De grees the Stone being continued in the same Direction at the several Stations the Proportions of its Power one to another would be much the same as if the Angle of the Needle at the first beginning made but 87 or even but 80 Degrees on the Quadrant for upon a small alte ration of the Poles of the Stone such diversity of An gles will arise In these Experiments I made use of two Needles one of a Radius of 6 Inches the other but of one Inch Which last after abundance of tryals I found to be most accurate besides the Advantage it gave in begin 2 Z z z 2 ning508 ning the Experiment 6 Inches nearer the Stone than the other And from two Feet distance from the same it became nearly agreeable to the Angles made by the long Needle to all the farther Distances as you will find by the following Tables which were made with the several Needles in the same direction of the Stone I measured the Angles by a Silk thread strained directly over the Needle to that part of the Quadrant to which it was directed which was the best way I could con trive to come nearest the truth It may be observd from the following Tables that the long Needle at 9 Inches from the Stone made some what a larger Angle than the short Needle at 3 Inches distance from the same that the short Needle at the di stance of 9 Inches made an Angle of 9 Degrees less than the long one at the same place But this odds will easily be accounted for if we consider the disproporti ons of the Needles lengths for the Point of the long Needle at 9 Inches was brought within an Inch as near the Stone as the Point of the short Needle was when but 3 Inches distant from the same The Point of the short Needle at 9 Inches from the Stone was 5 Inches farther from it than the long one at the same Station These disproportions being considerd it is no wonder such difference of Angles should ensue upon the Use of the several Needles near the Stone for at two Feet and the farther distances they become nearly agreeable as I said before When I speak of Distances from the Needle I always mean from the Center of it Farther it is observable that the Stone at 5 Feet di stance from the Needle made an Angle of 2 Degrees with one and with the other of two and a half yet up on the absence of the Stone they would return to no Degrees as at first Which plainly shews that the Influ ence of the Stone extended farther altho Observations at remoter Stations could not easily be determined Ex509 Experiments by the short Needle Distances of the The several The differences Loadstone from Angles of the compared one the Needle in Needle at the with another Inches several at the

and even the more remote in these Tables the Power of the Stone is so weak and the measuring the Angles at all times exactly so difficult that tis well if we come sometimes within 10 or 20 Minutes of

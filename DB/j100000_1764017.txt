Eu ropean states The idea is slowly evolving in con nection with our own government departments The state department has in training a body of con sular clerks The navy details men for special study in Greenwich Paris and Baltimore The war department has also allowed men to study in Baltimore laboratories Mr Trenholm the comp troller of the currency says he is going to select the brightest young men he can find and train them for bankexaminers The idea is in the air at Wash ington and it will sooner or later find a lodgement in every department and bureau You will probably hear of it next week from Col Carroll D Wright commissioner of the bureau of labor in his address on the study of statistics in American colleges be fore the American economic association at its meet ing in Cambridge May 24 1887 Statistical science finance forestry agrarian economy consular duties and diplomacy have never yet been taught to any considerable extent in our American schools and colleges You might as well expect a corps of mili tary engineers to evolve from the state militia as to suppose that the higher arts of administration can be acquired by either school or college training Administration is one of the highest branches of scientific politics and it seems to me that Science ought to recognize the fact As to the diplomatic service a Boston gentleman who has had much experience in this connection writes I have had a good deal to do with some of our diplomatic servants in Europe and have often been put to the blush for their incompetency to perform their duties Why should we not have a diplomatic ser vice like other nations and why should we not have a national institution in which the students should be taught among other things diplomacy   HERBERT B ADAMS Johns Hopkins univ May 16 The occurrence of similar inventions in areas widely apart The leading idea of Otis T Masons writings on ethnology is his attempt to classify human inventions and other ethnological phenomena in the light of biological specimens They may be divided into families genera and species They may be studied in their several ontogenies that is we may watch the unfolding of each individual thing from its raw material to its finished production They may be regarded as the products of specific evolution out of natural objects serving human wants and up to the most delicate machine performing the same func tion They may be modified by their relationship one to another in sets outfits apparatus just as the insect and flower are coordinately transformed They observe the law of change under environment and geographical distribution This method of re search is founded on the hypothesis that a connec tion of some kind exists between ethnological phe nomena of people widely apart Professor Mason is of this opinion and expresses it as follows  An thropologists assign similar inventions observed in different parts of the world to one of the following causes 1 The migration of a certain race of people who made the invention 2 The migration of ideas that is an invention may be made by a certain race or people and taught or loaned to peoples far NCE 485 removed in time and place 3 In human culture as in nature elsewhere like causes produce like effects Under the same stress and resources the same inven tions will arise From this standpoint Professor Mason has arranged the ethnological collections of the national museum according to objects not ac cording to the tribes to whom they belong in order to show the different species of throwingsticks bas ketry bows etc We cannot agree with the leading principles of Professor Masons ethnological researches In his enumeration of causes of similar inventions one is omitted which overthrows the whole system un like causes produce like effects It is of very rare occurrence that the existence of like causes for sim ilar inventions can be proved as the elements affect ing the human mind are so complicated and their influence is so utterly unknown that an attempt to find like causes must fail or will be a vague hy pothesis On the contrary the development of sim ilar ethnological phenomena from unlike causes is far more probable and due to the intricacy of the acting causes As far as inventions are concerned the disposition of men to act suitably is the only general cause but this is so general that it cannot be made the foundation of a system of inventions But from still another point of view we cannot consider Professor Masons method a progress of eth nological researches In regarding the ethnologi cal phenomenon as a biological specimen and trying to classify it he introduces the rigid abstractions species genus and family into ethnology the true meaning of which it took so long to understand It is only since the development of the evolutional theory that it became clear that the object of study is the individual not abstractions from the individ ual under observation We have to study each ethno logical specimen individually in its history and in its medium and this is the important meaning of the geographical province which is so frequently em phasized by A Bastian By regarding a single im plement outside of its surroundings outside of other inventions of the people to whom it belongs and outside of other phenomena affecting that people and its productions we cannot understand its meaning The only fact that a collection of implements used for the same purpose or made of the same material teaches is that man in different parts of the earth has made similar inventions while on the other hand a collection representing the life of one tribe enables us to understand the single specimen far better Our objection to Masons idea is that classi fication is not explanation His method as far as applied to objects which have a close connection with each other is very good The collection of moonshaped Eskimo knives or labrets from Northwest America has given us great pleasure and enables us to trace the distribution of those implements but even they do not fully answer the purpose of ethnological collections Besides these we want a collection arranged according to tribes in order to teach the peculiar style of each group The art and characteristic style of a people can be understood only by studying its productions as a whole In the collections of the national museum the marked character of the Northwest American tribes is almost lost because the objects are scattered in different parts of the building and are exhibited among those from other tribes Another instance will show that the arrangement486 SCIE of similar implements does not serve the purpose of ethnological collections From a collection of string instruments flutes or drums of  savage  tribes and the modern orchestra we cannot derive any conclu sion but that similar means have been applied by all peoples to make music The character of their music the only object worth studying which determines the form of the instruments cannot be understood from the single instrument but requires a complete collection of the single tribe Here however it can be seen that each ethnological collection affords only very fragmentary instruction that its real use is only to illustrate descriptions of the tribes For a study of native art and its development they are in dispensable For this purpose duplicates of which the superficial visitor of ethnological museums fre quently complains are absolutely necessary They are the only means of determining what is character istic of a tribe and what is merely incidental Masons method takes a place in ethnology similar to the former  comparing method in geography A mere comparison of forms cannot lead to useful results though it may be a successful method of finding problems that will further the progress of science The thorough study must refer to the his tory and development of the individual form and hence proceed to more general phenomena DR FRANZ BOAS New York May 13 Explosions in coalmines In Science for May 6 is a review of the report of the Atkinsons on explosions in coalmines One or two statements therein seem to convey an erroneous impression notably At the working faces the dust is not often a serious evil and under remedial measures that watering the roadways    is of little avail as a means of preventing explosions since the upper dust in every instance is left undisturbed The first quotation is manifestly an error as dust explosions can generally be traced to the firing of the dust in the working faces by blownout shots espe cially when such shots react against a tamping of coalslack In the main body of the article the argu ment seems to be in favor of the dust in the gang ways as the proximate cause of explosion while it is but the ultimate cause The dust formed by cutting or breaking down coal has very little to do with the formation of an explosive mixture because it is not impalpable enough As the article states the gang way dust is ground to an impalpable powder and carried away by the air but such dust would do little harm did the return currents through the working places not lose their velocity and deposit this impalpable dust on the walls nearest the face from the fact that the ventilating currents must sweep the faces free from smoke and foul air In the only known American accident due to dust the Pocahontas explosion there was little evidence of initial explosive force along the gangways but in the headings of dusty rooms there occurred a series of explosions that made the fact evident that fine dust in headings is the cause of so many accidents The Prussian commission showed that a certain percentage of volatile matter was necessary for an explosive dust and experiments made at this place show that the temperature at which coals give up their volatile ingredients vary so that a blownout shot from a hole tamped with coal slack projected YN E VOL IX No 224 into a chamber whose x alls are thickly powdered withl fine dust will have its flame prolonged by the dust of the tamping and the gases from that dust and the case will be analogous to those stated by Professor Abel where a small admixture of gas would render inert dusts explosive Finally it has been found that watering dusty roads with brine at intervals of thirty days made the dusts less ready to rise in clouds and stopped the formation of  upper dust But the best way of all is to keep the roads clean by ballasting them at the outset with rock or shale free from carbon and by picking off the coal shaken from cars In the Poca hontas accident the explosive phenomena ceased as soon as the current left the region where the roads were ballasted with coalslack and the action in the parts ballasted with slate was a simple burning of the dust brought there by the current In spite of an explosive coal the parts of that mine last men tioned were comparatively free from dust and the props nearly all standing while in the former por tion there was explosive action in nearly every work ing place so that the tracks were torn to pieces and the props down In mines of this nature black powder should be avoided and the coal should be wedged or if the coal must be shattered the dyna mite cartridge with water casing can be used with impunity EDWARD EH WILLIAMS Jr Lehigh univ May 13 Waterfiltration It may be of interest to notice in connection with your note on the results of Dr Swartss experiments on the relation of waterfiltration to bacterial devel opment that Dr J H M Munro in his experiments on the nitrification of wellwaters discovered and called attention to the fact that a wellwater nitrified more rapidly after filtration through a Lipscombes charcoal filter in common use than did an unfiltered sample of the same water Journ chem soc 1886 p 666 WILLIAM FREAR State college Penn May 16 The fact that an increase of microorganisms would take place in a filter constantly in use had already been demonstrated by Percy Frankland England and by several German investigators The series of experiments conducted by myself differed from theirs merely in using the filters found upon the local market and in imitating as near as possible their use in ordinary family watersupply cleansing in the first use by allowing the supply to pass through the filter to wash away detritus and not by absolute sterilization as in usual laboratory experiments The filters used were variously packed with bone or animal charcoal quartz the two com bined in layers felt and unglazed porcelain Such a result as that spoken of in Science ix p 457 is to be expected when we consider the me chanical work we have to do in filtration for no amount of chemical change is expected except in Clarkes process which is precipitation not filtra tion If the filter is a successful strainer the sus pended matters within the water are held back upon the surface of the strainer and within the interstices of the filtering media whether it be gauze asbestos iron shavings felt or porcelain The great mistake seems to be in believing that by use of a current of water or by removing the media and scrubbing the surface with a brush all the filtrate is removed for I

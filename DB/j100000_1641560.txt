eighthour problem There should not be political aspects in a topic that is so preeminently a problem of science Fur thermore considered as a problem of sci ence the eighthour day is rarely viewed in its proper light In the voluminous liter ature that has been published concerning it economic and social considerations have been too often paramount Yet in an ade quate analysis of it the real basis of the whole matter is physiologicalthe eight hour problem is primarily a problem of physiology if the physiological effects of any kind of labor are bad the conditions of such labor ought to be changed This is fundamental and should precede any consideration of the economic and social effects of a change of conditions This basic fact is continually overlooked The eighthour day is the result of an evolution beginning in human aspiration and fostered largely by humanitarian mo tives That baser considerations the de sire to earn wages at the minimum cost of personal effort impel many advocates of the eighthour principle can not be denied but this need not blind us to the fact that there are higher grounds on which the prob lem can legitimately be discussed In the evolution of the

Public Health Association Cin cinnati October 25 1916N S VOL XLIV No 1143 ditional division of the diurnal twenty four hours into eight hours each of work recreation and sleep It is said that the customary duration of the workingday of the fifteenth century was eight hours Whether this be true or not during the sub sequent three hundred years all the evils of unrestricted labor flourished vigorously At the beginning of the nineteenth century most English artisans were accustomed to work from eleven to fifteen hours in the day No delicate physiological tests were needed to demonstrate what such a sys tem was doing to destroy the vital mechan isms of men women and children The results were sufficiently obvious and the next one hundred years were marked by a series of struggles between workers and humanitarians on the one side and capi talists on the other in which progress toward a physiological workingday was gradually though slowly made After sporadic reductions of the workingperiod to twelve hours or less a tenhour move ment was succeeded in time by a ninehour movement and by the middle of the cen tury the eighthour day had been definitely proposed It was won first not in the mothercountry but by the artisans of Mel bourne Australia in 1856 and this date marks the beginning of achievement of the eighthour movement In the United States agitation in its favor began immediately after the close of the Civil War stimulated no doubt by the great extension of indus trial work which then occurred Thus since the middle of the nineteenth century the eighthour day has been the goal of labor Such a day presupposes one days rest in every seven and thus signifies a fortyeighthour week It is usually coupled however with an extra half holiday which for the majority of per sons would be taken on Saturday after noon In this manner the weeks work would be reduced to fortyfour hours and this represents the present demand of the eighthour movement Partly by law and partly by private agreement between employer and employed the eighthour day has been granted in recent years to one group of workers here and another there usually localized groups and rarely in cluding all the workers in a single industry of a single country At the present time it has become legalized in our own country for public employees and employees on public works in the federal service and in thirty states and territories for miners in the service of fourteen states for em ployees in smelting and reduction works in nine states for railroad telegraphers in six states for employees in rolling rod and stamp mills in five states for em ployees in tunnels and in coke ovens in three states for employees in blast fur naces in cement and plaster mills and those who work under high air pressure in two states for employees in electric light and power plants glass works and irrigation works in one state and for employees in days work unless otherwise stipulated in nine states In 1913 of the 1276048 employees constituting the shop force of the 51118 factories in the state of New York 354641 or 28 per cent worked 51 hours or less in the week The eight hour day will doubtless ultimately be achieved by a very large proportion of the worlds workers in the more highly civilized countries What should determine the duration of daily labor Here I would place as of first importance the physiological effects of the work and as secondary and subordi nate factors its economic and social fea tures The physiological effects of labor are now so well known as to require here only brief mention The expenditure of energy by the bodily organs involves chemical and physical changes in them which if con 728 SCIENCENOVEMBER 24 1916 SCIE tinued leads to the physiological state of fatigue Fatigue is characterized chem ically by the diminution within the acting tissues of chemical substances that have previously been stored within the living cells and either serve as sources of energy or are otherwise essential to tissue activ ity and by the appearance within the liv ing cells of other chemical substances products of katabolic action which are known as fatigue substances and react upon the tissues to decrease their power of responding to stimuli If the same amount of work as before is then to be performed by the organs the nervous system must send to them more powerful impulses and when this becomes no longer possible the amount of work decreases Fatigue sub stances spread from the place of their origin to other organs and react upon them and thus the activity of one physiological mechanism such for example as a neuro muscular mechanism fatigues others In fatigue the senses are less acute attention is less sharply focused the power of dis crimination is lessened the muscles are weakened the quickness and the accuracy of muscular action are decreased glandu lar secretions seem to be decreased the heartbeat may be slowed or in extreme cases possibly quickened and irregular the blood vessels of the skin are dilated and draft an undue quantity of blood away from the brain In fatigue the sense of weariness obtrudes and oppresses but it can not be too strongly emphasized or too often reiterated that the feeling of fatigue is a very uncertain index of the presence of a measurable degree of the fatigue of the tissues The feeling may indeed ap pear just at the time when its warning note is really needed but it may sound an un duly early and a false alarm and again and especially when other potent psychic influences inhibit it its coming may be un duly postponed It is a fitful capricious WNCE 729 thing and this fact is too often overlooked in the consideration of industrial fatigue All these physiological changes may be within normal limits and by rest the irri tability of the tissues can then be readily restored and the ffeshness of sensation and the vigor of mind and muscle can be brought back But if the work has been too strenuous or too longcontinued if the chemical changes in the tissues have gone too far or if rest has been unduly cur tailed fatigue passes over into a patholog ical state which is known as exhaustion and is far less easily recovered from Not only is the power of achievement then further diminished but susceptibility to specific disease is increased There may be a gen eral neurasthenia or other diseases of the nervous system including nervous affec tions of the bodily organs The will may be weakened and resistance to immoral temptations may be lessened Intemper ance is one of the common results of bod ily exhaustion and even crime itself finds here one of its prolific sources Resistance to infectious disease may be diminished ap parently because of a diminution of the protective antibodies Thus excessive fatigue may bring in its train many disas trous sequelae with much physical and moral misery The seeds of this more serious state are often sowed in industrial work when the conditions of labor and liv ing are such that a residuum of the fatigue of one day is carried over to the next and from day to day there is a cumulative even if slight diminution of physiological powers Let us develop a little further this topic of the physiological effects of labor Lab oratory experiments have demonstrated that the degree of fatigue of a muscle in a given time varies in accordance with both the amount of the weight lifted and the rapidity with which stimuli are sent to the tissue Increasing the weight or makingN S VOL XLIV No 1143 the muscle contract more rapidly in creases the degree of fatigue in a given time and if continued brings on earlier exhaustion These facts have their counter part in industrial work for fatigue here too depends on the intensity and the ra pidity of repetition of the individual acts performed by the laborer In general it may be said that the introduction of so called laborsaving machinery has dimin ished the intensity and increased the ra pidity of repetition of the laborers acts Lifeless machines now often lift the heavy weights once raised by human muscles Other lifeless machines intricate and auto matic relieve the laborer of much of his former light muscular work But these same machines need to be tended by hu man agencies and set the pace for human activities and the tendency is ever toward increasing the quickness and the constancy with which senseorgans brain spinal cord and muscles must act The introduction of periods of rest while a laboratory experiment with a muscle is in progress diminishes the fatigue of the moment aids recuperation and delays the oncoming of exhaustion This is demon strated very perfectly in each of us several times in a minute since each beat of the heart is followed immediately by a resting period of sufficient length to enable the cardiac muscle completely to recuperate from the fatiguing effects of the previous contraction The beneficial effects of simi lar resting periods in industrial labor are shown by the custom not uncommon since the striking demonstration of the late Mr Frederick Taylor in the lifting of heavy iron pigs of giving workers occasional brief intervals of freedom from their tasks The defenders of the twelvehour duration of work in blast furnaces attempt to justify their attitude by the contention that the workman actually works but a fraction of the whole time on duty A timely and striking instance of the value of frequent resting periods is reported by the British Health of Munition Workers Committee Two officers at the front recently for a friendly wager competed in making equal lengths of a cer tain trench each with an equal squad of men One let his men work as they pleased but as hard as possible The other divided his men into three sets to work in rotation each set digging their hardest for five minutes and then resting for ten till their spell of labor came again The latter team won easily Fatigue is modified by the external con ditions under which the work is performed Thus it was found by Scott and myself that when an animal had been exposed for six hours to an atmosphere with a tempera ture of 91 F 33 C and 90 per cent relative humidity the fatigue of the ani mals muscles came on more rapidly and their working power was diminished by about one quarter Certain industrial oc cupations too require their work to be per formed in the midst of excessive heat and humidity and thus afford the conditions of an early oncoming of fatigue and exhaus tion Doubtless other environmental con ditions such as excessive or deficient light noise and gross mechanical vibrations in fluence the fatigue process but these have not been adequately and experimentally studied Attention might here be called to the suggestive little book recently published by the Gilbreths which shows by what easy and simple means unnecessary fatigue may often be avoided It is obvious that if under any given con ditions of intensity and rate of labor and of its environmental features the working day is of such a length as to bring about the evil physiological results here men tioned the surest way to avoid them is to shorten it There exist few if any stud ies devoted to the specific physiological ef fects of a reduction of the workinghours and this gap in our knowledge it is desir able to fill but that the general health of 730 SCIENCENOVEMBER 24 1916 laborers has thereby been benefited is testified to by many observers and this is equivalent in other words to an improved physiological status among them The economic argument that industry can thrive only with a long workingday and that any curtailment of it would be de structive is perennial and has often been potent in discussion This argument can be met very effectively by pointing to the effects of shortening the workingperiod on the quantity and quality of output in man ufacture These effects are so uniform that it may be stated as a general law that upon reduction of the daily hours of labor the average quantity of the output of the in dividual worker undergoes a preliminary decrease then a return to the original amount and finally a permanent increase This augmentation of output occurs not only with a reduction to ten but even to eight hours Instances of this are nu merous Thus the very careful study by Professor Abbe of the effects of reducing the workingday in the Zeiss Optical Works in Jena from nine to eight hours shows an average increase of about three per cent in the daily output of the employees A cer tain steel works in England reports that each of its machines turns out in eight hours the same amount of work formerly produced in nine hours In the steelsheet and tinplate trades of South Wales it is stated that after the change from the twelve to the eighthour day the increase of output in the rollingmills amounted to twenty and in the openhearth melting process to twelve and onehalf per cent In the year following the introduction of the eighthour day into some of the coal mines of South Yorkshire it was reported that the production was greatly in excess of what was ever produced by an equal number of men when the men worked twelve or thirteen hours In the mining of bituminous coal in the state of Illinois during the three years previous to a re duction in 1897 of the workingday from ten to eight hours the average amount of coal turned out daily by each individual was 272 tons and during the subsequent three years 316 tons an increase of 16 per cent The president of a granitecutting company which had kept for many years a careful record of each employees work writes in 1912 that the system shows that the same man under identically the same conditions accomplished more of exactly the same kind of work when he was working nine hours than he did when he was working ten hours and again when the hours were reduced to eight hours this same man accomplished still more in an eight hour day than he did in a ninehour day or a con siderable amount more than he did when the day was ten hours long A German proprietor of glassworks re ports that in a very short time after the re duction of the workingday from twelve and eleven to eight hours there was produced without increase of staff as much as before the reduction and a proprietor of glass works in the north of France says I must acknowledge that the men produce just as much if not more in their seven and a half hours actual work than during the tenhour day that preceded it At the Engis Chemical Works near Liege where a very exact study was made of the results of introducing the eighthour day it was reported that In an eighthours day seven and one half hours actual work the same men at the same fur naces with the same tools and raw material have produced as much as before in a twelvehour day ten hours actual work A very significant comparison of the ef fects of long and short hours was made in connection with the building in the same years of two of our battleships the Louisi ana and the Connecticut The Louisiana was built at Newport News by a private company working its men ten hours a day the Connecticut was built at the Brooklyn SCIENCE 731N S VOL XLIV No T143 Navy Yard under the eighthour system In a report on the progress of the work during the first nineteen months it is stated by the compiler No other factor is considered than the produc tive ability of the two bodies of men doing ex actly the same kind of work using the same kind of tools and the same kind of material It is prac tically all hand work as the output of the auto matic machines with their speed limitations in production per hour does not enter into this work The final computation showed that the average production of a man per hour on the Connecticut exceeded by 2428 per cent the average production per man per hour on the Louisiana Thus the statistics reveal the utter fal lacy of the notion that a longer working day means a larger output But the greater product of the short day is I sub mit at first thought a very surprising fact and its cause should be inquired into It undoubtedly rests on a physiological basis but without more accurate data any expla nation of it must be only tentative If man were a mere nonliving automatic ma chine it would not occur But his is a very different mechanism in which that portion which does work the effector machinery is directed by a nervous system which acts now consciously now unconsciously and through its receptor machinery is being continually influenced by external stimuli All employers testify to the increased good will better spirit and improved morale of the workers that result from the shorter day Because of these things the workers arrive more promptly at their places and tend to shirk less as the day proceeds It is not inconceivable that in many cases there is a residuum of fatigue accumulated from the previous longer workingperiod which must first be gotten rid of and that there after the effector mechanism is less clogged It is not improbable that realization of the brevity of the day and the early relief from toil act as a tonic Such tonics exist The spurt that oecirs during the last hour of labor irrespective of its length is a com monly alleged if not an attested fact and is ascribed to anticipation of release Care ful observation has shown too that other psychic influences increase markedly the output of a mans energy All these varied influences acting upon the nervous system doubtless contribute to increase the expenditure of productive energy in the shorter time Their combined influence is largely unconscious and it is reported that the greater output is often a surprise to the workers themselves That it has an origin largely in the action on the nervous system of such external stimuli as have been mentioned is supported by the further facts that with the eighthour day the work man makes fewer mistakes and spoils less material and in general the quality of his work shows a distinct improvement Thus in the light of the facts of experi ence the alleged economic necessity of the longer workingperiod because of the ne cessity of a greater output falls to the ground The long workingperiod defeats its own object But the question may still be raised whether the greater output of the eight hour day does not produce correspondingly greater fatigue and thus in turn defeat its object I do not think so If the days fatigue were measured merely by the amount of energy transformed in producing the product if here again man were a mere automatic machine then surely there would be a direct ratiothe greater the product the greater the fatigue and nothing would be gained But the case is not so simple as this The days fatigue is a sequel not simply of the amount of energy directly transformed in producing the material out put It is derived also from other sources from the continuance of one bodily posi tion perhaps a strained position from the noise and gross vibration of machinery 732 SCIENCENOVEMBER 24 1916 from strained attention from all those minor factors which Abbe has grouped to gether as sources of his wellnamed pas sive fatigue A shorter day eliminates these by so much and at its end leaves the worker so much better off than his longer laboring fellow The argument for shorter hours that is most frequently put forward by labor leaders at least is the social one Thus Mr Samuel Gompers says The shorter workday is something more than an economic demand It is a demand for an oppor tunity for rest recuperation development things which make life more than mechanical drudgery This is undoubtedly a legitimate de mand but it in turn is dependent on the physiological requirements of the labor If a man is worked beyond his physiolog ical limit he is incapacitated for his duties to his family and to society The history of labor has demonstrated this abundantly and the experience of reducing the hours pf labor has almost universally been fol lowed by marked moral and social im provement such as is shown by decrease in intemperance and crime improvement in living conditions greater efforts toward education greater intelligence and greater industrial efficiencyall this in contradic tion not only to the vivid predictions of disaster pronounced by active and unprin cipled opponents of the change but to the fears of those who were wellmeaning but timid As possible factors in determining the duration of labor I might mention the de gree of skill required by the laborer and the degree of responsibility devolving upon him These may rightly be potent in de termining the amount of wage to be paid since they are the accompaniments of greater intelligence and the results of greater training but in their bearing on the length of the workingday they can be considered it seems to me only in the light of their physiological demands on the la borer If the exercise of greater skill and the possession of greater responsibility de plete his physical and mental powers more quickly he has earned a shorter working period If they do not I see no reason why he should be granted time privileges Let me here summarize Of the various agencies that have been considered as legiti mate factors in determining the length of the workingday that which appears to me the most weighty is the physiological one the physiological effects of the labor on the individual laborer In the pursuit of his vocation as the employee of another every human being has a right to the preserva tion of his physiological powers to the avoidance of excessive fatigue to the con tinuance of his health All questions of the percentage of financial profit all questions of social demands or social opportunity are subordinate to this Moreover this is essential to the other considerations men tioned for only by the preservation of his health can the economic demands of his work be satisfied only by this can he ac quire and maintain skill and be worthy of responsibility The whole question of the length of the workingday thus rests pri marily on a physiological basis In decid ing the length of the workingday there fore the first and allimportant query is Is a long day physiologically detrimental to the individual If so it should be short ened If the long day is not physiolog ically detrimental then it is a fair ques tion whether because of his employers in terests or his own relations to society his day should be long or short Is the reduction of the workingperiod to the eighthour day a physiological ne cessity Here two factors are to be con sidered The characteristics of the labor and the capacity of the laborer Different occupations differ greatly in their fatigu ing power Especially productive of fa SCIENCE 733N S VOL XLIV No 1143 tigue are those that are characterized by great muscular effort unusual quickness or complexity of muscular action single acts however simple that are monoton ously repeated over long intervals of time constant strain in attention or bodily posi tion and those in which the work is car ried on in excessively crowded places in excessive heat and humidity in the midst of excessive noise or under other unfavor able environmental conditions While different occupations thus differ in fatiguing power not only in themselves but in accordance with the external condi tions under which the work is performed there exist also great differences among hu man beings in their susceptibility to fatigue from a given occupation This also is par alleled by individual muscles in a familiar laboratory experiment Homologous mus cles from different experimental animals or even from opposite limbs of the same ani mal when stimulated at the same rate and lifting equal loads do not usually perform the same amount of work In industrial work every observant foreman who knows his men recognizes their individual differ ences in working power Neither the fatiguing effects of the mani fold varieties of labor nor the susceptibili ties of different laborers to fatigue have been studied with the degree and the care that the subjects demand and with such paucity of knowledge it seems hardly pos sible at present to attempt to answer the question whether the reduction of the workingperiod to eight hours is a physio logical necessity The universality of the beneficial effects of such a reduction how ever argues strongly in favor of an affirma tive reply There has been no more clear sighted observer and more logically ana lytic thinker on this topic than the late Professor Abbe of Jena in whom the breadth of scholarly culture was combined with a keen sense of efficient business or ganization Ten years ago after carefully analyzing the results of the reduction of the workingday in the Zeiss Optical Works and elsewhere and considering the general condition of German industries with their then prevailing long and English indus tries with their short workingday Abbe came to the conclusion that by far the ma jority of industrial workers do not reach their optimum in nine and do not surpass it in eight hours With him the shorter day represents the physiological ideal and the goal for which industries should strive I am disposed to agree in general with Professor Abbes conclusion for the pres ent day But it is evident I think that such a conclusion offers merely a tempo rary expedient The establishment of a rigid and universal eighthour system would probably prove not to be the best for all industries and for all individuals In order to enable the wisest decision of the question to be made there is needed not mere opinionsnot the opinions of employ ers however broadminded or narrow minded or of laborers however indus trious or indolent or of labor leaders how ever generous or selfish their ambitions or of the laity however philanthropic their motives or of statesmen whether they are impelled by a high idealism or by practical politics but a rigidly scientific study of the question through the medium of labora tory tests of the physiological effects of different occupations and the physiological capacities of different laborers and a re sultant classification on a physiological basis of work and workers Such a study is not impossible and it would afford the only basis for a rational and really intelli gent solution of the problem It would doubtless lead to the establishment of no rigid but an elastic system in which the work would be adapted to the worker and the worker to the work In one industry the duration of labor might be eight hours 734 SCIENCENOVEMBER 24 1916 in another it might be more or less than eight hours So too within a single indus try one worker might labor longer than another Such a solution could be made to satisfy both economic and social demands and lead to the maximum of individual and national efficiency I quite realize the difficulties inherent in putting into practise a system which does not recognize the magic eight hours as the ideal and especially the still greater diffi culties in the establishment of a system in which within a single occupation one per son works longer than another But I be lieve that these difficulties would prove less formidable if we would once get accus tomed to the notion that individual capac ity is the first criterion to be considered in deciding upon labors duration The ad justment of wages according to individual capacity I will leave to the economists In view of all this how fatuous was the action of the state of California in voting in 1914 on the question whether the eight hour day should be adopted The propo sition was defeated by about two to one but the decision was necessarily a matter of sentiment resting on no basis of adequate knowledge  An affair of such serious moment ought not to be decided by unin structed popular feeling The recent ac tion of Congress in imposing after a few hours consideration an eighthour day upon railway employees can hardly be called more sagacious than the action of California The Adamson bill however has little bearing on the general principle of the eighthour day It is obvious that any formal regulation of the duration of daily labor is for those whose daily services are employed by others By so much as a man rises above this stage he becomes free to choose his own workingtime It is a noteworthy fact that with the worlds leaders in industry in finance in professional life the duration of the daily task is wholly secondary to its accomplishment They are limited by no eight or ten or twelve or sixteenhour considerations This indicates why such men become leaders Laborers can learn a valuable lesson from this fact The greedy employer who constantly saps the energies of those who are the medium by which he gains his wealth is to be condemned no more than is the slacker whose only guiding principles are a minimum of effort and a maximum of wage Moreover it is trite to say that the obligation rests upon the laborer that rests upon all men so to use his free hours as to benefit himself his fam ily and society In conclusion I can not refrain from quoting with warm approval of their senti ments and of their application to our own country the recent significant words of Sir George Newman regarding British indus tries Our national experience in modern industry is longer than that of any other people It has shown clearly enough that false ideas of economic gain blind to physiological law must lead as they led through the nineteenth century to vast national loss and suffering It is certain that unless our industrial life is to be guided in the future by the application of physiological science to the details of its management it can not hope to maintain its position hereafter among some of its foreign rivals who already in that respect have gained a present advantage FREDERIC S LEE COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY

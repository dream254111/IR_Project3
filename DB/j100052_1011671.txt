National Conservation Commission Washington D C Current Tendencies This is an age of science and ours a nation of science Obser vation has matured in measurement and passed from the qualitative to the quantitative generalization is a habit and prevision has be come a commonplace in current life More than all else the course of nature has come to be investigated in order that it may be redi rected along lines contributing to human welfare invention has be come a step toward creation and is extending far beyond the merely mechanical and into the realms of the chemical and even the vital Now is the time of conquest over nature in practical sense of pan urgy in philosophic sensethe day of prophecy made perfect in predetermined accomplishment Our country is growing rapidly The rate varies along different lines Our growth in agricultural production is unprecedented in the worlds history our growth in population is so much more rapid that exportation of foodstuffs is declining our growth in mining outruns our increase in population our growth in manufacturing far exceeds that in mining and our growth in application of mechan ical power is much more rapid than our advance in manufacturing Along one line only is our growth more rapid than in the use of poweri e in that knowledge and mental capacity required to guide and develop the material progress Our rate of mental growth is not easily measured in that its manifestations are manifold In I905 it was pointed out that along the single line of university development the rate of advance is geometricthat during the first half of the nineteenth century our university strength measured in endowments or faculties or stu dents or alumni or all combined doubled that during the next quartercentury it doubled again that from I875 to I890 it doubled again that in the next decade it once more doubled and that within 52IThe Annals of the American Academy the first seven years of the present century it would inevitably double again Naturally such whelming growth can not continue indefinitely on any line yet the advance can and does continue largely by the development of new lines or by multiplication of the old so patently that it is safe to characterize our progress in knowledge and mental power as geometric Our growth in knowledge of that definite character called sci ence is notableparticularly in its evermultiplying applications Twentyfive years ago the writer compiled a geologic map of the United States the first based wholly on observation and not at all on inference and although a quarter of the area was left blank it was complete enough for publication1 a year later he compiled the first map showing the distribution of coal in the United States which was fairly complete for twothirds of our area yet so incomplete for the remaining third as not to be deemed worthy of publication The facts that today any geologic map may be made substantially complete and that our coal deposits have been surveyed not only as to area but as to volume strikingly illustrate the rapidity and sureness of our progress in practical knowledge With the growth of science its field has extended and its agencies have multiplied When the Federal Geological Survey was started and the State surveys were reinvigorated only three decades ago they stood almost alone for the development of the natural resources aside from the land reckoned in area merely Now the surveys have grown an entire Federal Department and corresponding State instrumentalities have come up on the basis of resources comprising the land and its products and potentialities a wide range of minerals the forests which protect the streams and of late the water itself It is in harmony with the general development that the quantitative method is now applied not only to soil production in forests and crops and to mine production and minerals in the ground but finally to the rains and rivers which render the land habitable and the ground waters which render it fruitful No more significant advance has been made in our history than that of the last year or two in which our waters have come to be considered as a resourceone definitely limited in quantity yet 1It appeared under the title Map of the United States exhibiting the present status of knowledge of the geological groups Fifth Annual Report of the U S Geological Survey 1885 pages 3638 plate ii 522 38Water as a Resource susceptible of conservation and of increased beneficence through wise utilization The conquest of nature which began with pro gressive control of the soil and its products and passed to the min erals is now extending to the waters on above and beneath the surface The conquest will not be complete until these waters are brought under complete control Units of Measure The quantitative view of water except in smaller measures is so new to thought that familiar units are lacking Municipal water supply is generally expressed in gallons irrigation water in acre feet stream flow in secondfeet or more accurately secondsfeet and water for certain uses in the variable and indefinite minersinch There is urgent need of a unit applicable to the quantities commonly used for water supply irrigation and various other purposes Mod erate familiarity with the metric system would render convenient as such a unit the stere equivalent to the kiloliter or cubit meter the virtual basis of the metric system for volume or tridimensional measure which roughly approximateslike the liter the quartthe cubic yard in quantity and the ton in weight of water while the kilostere approximates IOOO tons and an acrefoot The kilostere is especially convenient in discussing the water supply of the United States in that it permits expression of the leading values in round numbers not too large for ready comprehensionthe mean rainfall totaling six billion 6ooooooooo kilosteres and its main deriva tive fractions being expressible in sixths of this total2 Pending adoption of the metric unit and as a glaring illustra tion of the need it is necessary to employ either the cubic foot or the cubic mile in dealing quantitatively with our water supply preferably the former for the supply of a country the latter for the 2A few of the equivalents involved in the use of the stere follow 1 liter equals 026 gal 6102 cu In 22 lbs 1 stere

using the units interchangeably and coupling both with the metric system OUR STOCK OF WATER The World Supply The water of the world or hydrosphere is about I6oo00 of the globe or some 410000000 cubic miles Nearly threequarters oc cupies depressions in the earthcrust as seas about a quarter or some Ioooooooo cubic miles permeates earth and rocks as ground water the remaining small fraction is gathered in freshwater lakes and channels accumulated in snow and ice or distributed in the atmosphere as aqueous vapor The mean annual precipitation is about 30000 cubic miles 440000oo0000000000 cubic feet I25000000000 kilosteres I1OOOOOO000 acrefeet over the lands of the globe and 90o0oo cubic miles on the oceansin all 20000ooo cubic miles 17600000 ooooooooo cubic feet 500000000000 kilosteres 400000000 ooo acrefeet The vapor in the atmosphere tempers the climate without it the globe would be uninhabitable The average quantity is probably much less than the mean annual precipitation The sole source of the fresh waters of the world is the pre cipitation mainly in rain partly in snow slightly in mist and fog without it the lands would be barren the earth a dead planet The most active part of the worlds water is the small fraction forming streams these with some help from glacier ice have sculptured nearly all of the land surface of the globe collected materials for the geologic formations and shaped the continents running water being by far the most important earthbuilding agency The most effective portion of the water in the organic world is the minute fraction circulating through structures and maintain ing the vital processesfor water is the primal constituent and pri mordial source of living things National Supply The mean annual precipitation on the territory of mainland United States is about 30 inches the quantity falling on the land 524 40Water as a Resource with the included water areas is about two hundred and fifteen trillion 215000oooooooooooo cubic feet  1500 cubic miles 6ooo oooooo kilosteres 4800000000 acre feet It is equivalent to ten Mississippi rivers From this source all our running stand ing and ground waters are derived The yearly rainfall on the more humid twofifths of the country east of the ninetyfifth meridian or what may be called the state divide forming the eastern boundary of the five median states North Dakota South Dakota Nebraska Oklahoma and Texas is nearly 48 inches the quantity about I40000000000000 cubic feet I000 cubic mills 4000oooooo kilosteres On the semiarid fifth of our area in these median states or between the ninety fifth and hundred and third meridians the rainfall averages 30 inches and aggregates some 40000000000000 cubic feet The rain fall on the western twofifths of the country including our arid lands averages about I2 inches or about 35000000000000 cubic feet 250 cubic miles 1000000000 kilosteres Of the total rainfall over half is evaporated about a third flows into the sea the remaining sixth is either consumed or ab sorbed These divisions which may be called respectively the fly off the runoff and the cutoff are partly interchangeable About a third of the runoff or a tenth of the entire rainfall passes through the Mississippi The runoff is increasing with cultivation and de forestation that of the Mississippi has increased from some I9500 ooooooooo cubic feet as measured by Humphreys and Abbott fifty years ago to over 22000000000000 cubic feet as recently gauged by Leighton It is wholly within reach of human control The 110000000000000 cubic feet 300ooooooo kilosteres of flyoff affects agriculture and other industries largely through climate Except in moderate degree through scientific agriculture and forestry it is beyond artificial control The 70000000000000 cubic feet 2000000000 kilosteres of runoff is available for water supply irrigation navigation and power It is controlled in small part and may be wholly controlled by proper means The remainder of the rainfall the 35000000000000 cubic feet or I000000ooo kilosteres of cutoff is either consumed in plant growth and other chemical combinations or else permeates the deeper strata and passes subterraneously into the sea It is 525 4IThe Annals of the American Academy partly controlled chiefly through farming and forestry and the con trol may be much increased OUR USE AND WASTE OF WATER The Flyoff Of the hundred and ten trillion I Iooooooooooooo cubic feet 750 cubic miles 3ooooooooo kilosteres of water annually evap orated in mainland United States incidental use is made through the settlement and industrial development depending on the presence of aqueous vapor in the atmosphere Much of it is reprecipitated generally after an easterly movement perhaps half of the vapor content of the air and the precipitation e g at St Louis is de rived from the Pacific primarily and from original precipitation and evaporation within the arid and semiarid regions secondarily the other moiety coming from the Gulf of Mexico Neither the quain tity nor the relations of the flyoff are known accurately systematic observations and records of evaporation in different regions and under varying conditions have only recently been undertaken by the Weather Bureau Evaporation is rapid from trees and many crop plants by reason of transporation Probably it is less rapid from water surfaces and still less from grass lands or bare earth and rock in which the water is held by molecular attraction and surface tension Recent investigations in the Forest Service and the Hydro graphic Branch of the Geological Survey render it clear that defor estation e g in the Ohio Valley is followed by diminished precipi tation doubtless by reason of reduced sublocal evaporation i e that the aqueous vapor and circulation are interdependent with surface conditions and hence measurably subject to control The flyoff is adapted to largely increased population and industries The Runoff Of the seventy trillion 70ooooo00000ooo cubic feet 5oo cubic miles 2ooooooo000o kilosteres annually flowing into the sea little more than IOOOOOOOOOOO cubic feet 28ooooo kilosteres or oneseventh of one per cent is taken from rivers and lakes and protected catchment areas for municipal and community supply and related purposes less than two per cent or some ten per cent of that in the arid and semiarid regions is used for irrigation per 526 42Water as a Resource haps five per cent may be reckoned as in small use for navigation and less than five per cent is utilized for power It is estimated that eightyfive per cent to ninetyfive per cent of the volume is wasted in freshets or destructive floods It is reckoned by M 0 Leighton Chief of the Hydrographic Branch of the Geological Survey that for municipal and community water supply there are protected catchment areas aggregating over Ioooooo acres and that fully 25ooooooo are invested in water works with nearly as much more in the appurtenant catchment areas and other lands The population so supplied approaches I0000000 the annual consumption is about 37500000000 cubic feet  000oooooo kilosteres or onetwentieth of one per cent of our runoff The better managed systems protect the catchment areas by forests or grass the water is completely controlled the storm product is stored and there is little waste save through overlavish use after the impounded flow enters the mains For irrigation it is estimated by Director Newell of the Re clamation Service that there are 200000000 invested in dams ditches reservoirs and other works for the partial control of the waters in addition to the value of the land which is virtually fixed by the availability of the water and that 1500000000000 cubic feet 42000000 kilosteresi e threequarters of one per cent of our total rainfall or two per cent of that on the western twofifths of our areaare annually diverted to irrigable lands aggregating some i3000000 acres Except in some cases through forestry there is little effort to control the catchment areas and few reser voirs are large enough to hold the storm waters so that the waste in public and private projects exceeds sixty per cent while less than twentyeight per cent of the water actually available for irri gation of the arid lands is restrained and diverted There are in mainland United States 287 streams navigated for an aggregate of 26226 miles3 and about an equal additional mileage might be made navigable by waterway improvement there are also fortyfive canals with a mileage of 2189 besides numerous abandoned canals4 On lake and sound routes there is a large traffic but the navigation of rivers and canals is too small for definite record Several hundred million dollars have been expended on sPreliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission 1909 Herbert Knox Smith on Navigable Streams of the United States page 35 4Ibid Herbert Knox Smith on Canals in the United States page 190 527 43The Annals of the American Academy special projects yet in spite of large appropriations for their im provement our rivers are less serviceable for interstate commerce today than they were half a century ago5 The cost of water carriage averaging about onefourth that of rail carriage and our railway freightage during I906 reaching 217000000000 tonmiles at an average rate of 077 cent the shipping of onefifth of our freight by water would have saved over 250000000 to our pro ducers and consumers Except through forestry in recent years together with a few reservoirs and canal locks and movable dams there has been little effort to control headwaters or catchment areas in the interests of navigation and none of our rivers are navigated to more than a small fraction even of their effective lowwater capa city The theoretical power of the streams is reckoned by Leighton alt 230000000 horse power The amount now used is computed by the Census Office at 5230000 horse power and the amount running over Government dams and not used is estimated by the Chief of Engineers at about 1400000 horse power The amount now available at a cost comparable with that of steam installation is estimated by the Hydrographic Branch of the Geological Survey at 37oooooo horse power and the amount prospectively available at 75000000 to I50000000 horse power The 3700o0000 horse power today available exceeds our entire mechanical power now in use and would operate every mill drive every spindle propel every train and boat and light every city town and village in the country The nominal value is 20 per horsepower year the price ranges up to 100 or I50 While the utilization of water power ranks among our most recent and most rapid industrial developments little effort has been made to control catchment areas or storm waters in any large way for power development though most plants effect local control through reservoirs and structures Nearly all of the freshet and flood water runs to waste and the low waters which limit the efficiency of power plants are increasing in frequency and duration with the increasing flood runoff The practical utility of streams for both navigation and power is measured by the effective lowwater stage the volume carried when the streams rise above this stage seventyfive to ninety per 5Preliminary Report of the Inland Waterways Commission 1909 Message of the President page vi 528 44Water as a Resource cent of the runoff is not only wasted but does serious damage The direct yearly damage by floods since 900oo as computed by Leighton has increased steadily from 45000000 to 238oooooo the indirect loss through depreciation of property is probably greater while the largest loss is that arising in impeded navigation and terminal transfers The freshets are attended by destructive soil erosion The soil matter annually carried into lower rivers and harbors or into the sea has recently been reckoned by Dole and Stabler at 7830ooo ooo tons Its removal seriously reduces the productivity of upland farms and increases channelcutting and barbuilding in the rivers It is estimated that soil erosion reduces farm production ten to twenty per cent that annual loss to farms alone is 500000000 and that large losses follow the fouling of the waters and the dimin ished navigability of the streams Through imperfect control of the running waters lowlands are temporarily or permanently flooded It is estimated that there are in mainland United States 75000ooo to 80oooooo acres of over flow and swamp lands requiring drainage that by systematic opera tions these might be drained and the water made available at mod erate expense and that they would then be worth two or three times the present value and cost of drainage and would furnish homes for 10000000 inhabitants A part of the runoff lodges temporarily in lakes and ponds It is estimated that the quantity of fresh water so stored including the American portion of the Great Lakes is about 600000000000 ooo cubic feet 45ooo cubic miles 28o000000000ooo kilosteres equivalent to three years rainfall or nine years runoff The natural reservoirs yield a water supply ordinarily requiring no control of catchment area Some 6oooooo of our people draw their water supply from lakes All the larger and deeper lakes are navigated they serve the chief part of our inland commerce by water The Cutoff Of the thirtyfive trillion 35oooooo0ooooo cubic feet 250 cubic miles Ioooooooo000 kilosteres of cutoff the chief share is absorbed by soil and earth or consumed by natural processes or through agriculture and related industries yet most of it returns to the original supply by natural circulation 529 45The Annals of the American Academy On an average the plant tissue of annual growths is three fourths and of perennial growths threeeighths water of human and stock food over eighty per cent is water and in animal tissue the ratio is about the same and is the chief vehicle for the trans mission of enteric and many other diseases Since water is the es sential circulatory medium in organic bodies the plants and animals of the country yearly require an amount many times exceeding their aggregate volume the average man of 150 pounds ingests over a ton 9oo liters thirtytwo cubic feet or thirteen times his volume of water each year and an average bushel of corn requires over 700 cubic feet twenty kiloliters or twentytwo tons of water in the makingof which the larger part is evaporated Even in the more humid sections of the country the productivity of the soil and the possible human population would be much larger if the rainfall were greater leaving a wider margin for organic and other chemical uses Except through irrigation little general effort is made to control the natural circulation though some farmers in arid regions claim to double or triple the crop from given soil by supplying water just when needed and withholding it when not required The greater part of the cutoff lodges temporarily in the soil and earth as ground water According to texture firedry rocks contain one to three per cent airdry rocks five to twentyfive per cent and saturated rocks and earths ten to forty per cent of water while the optimum moisture for plant growth in topsoil ranges from four to twenty per cent and it is estimated that the ground water to the depth of ioo00 feet in which it is available for hand pumps and capillarity and deeprooted trees averages five per cent over Ioooooo square miles twenty per cent over another third of the country and twentyfive per cent over the remaining third a mean of I6 23 per cent This ground water may be conceived as a subsurface reservoir 3000000 square miles in area and nearly seventeen feet deep containing over 1400000000000000 cubic feet oo00000oo cubic miles 404oooo000ooo000000o kilosteres equivalent to seven years rainfall or twenty years runoff It is the essential basis of agriculture and most other industries and the chief natural resource of the country it sustains forests and all other crops and supplies the perennial streams and springs and wells used by four fifths of our population and nearly all our domestic animals Its quantity is diminishel by the increased runoff due to deforestation 530 46Water as a Resource and injudicious farming Throughout the upland portions of eastern United States the average watertable has been lowered ten to fortv feet so that fully threefourths of the springs and shallower wells have failed and many brooks have run dry while the risk of crop loss by drought has proportionately increased and the waste through the Mississippi has increased over fifteen per cent Although the available ground water is subject to control by such treatment of soil and plant growth as to prevent freshets little effort has been made to retain it or increase its volume and it is probable that fully ten per cent of rich resource has been allowed to drain away since settlement began The water of the deeper rocks below 100 feet supplies artesian and other deep wells most thermal and min eral waters and many large springs it may be controlled in part through the subsurface reservoir and might be much better utilized In both ground and organisms the water except when frozen is in constant movement In the soil it moves under gravity and capillarity dissolves earthsalts and conveys them into and through the circulatory systems of living plants and then carries the katastates of growth and decay into the air or back into the earth matter to hasten its solution Some of the organic derivatives are excretory and poisonous to the plants yielding them or to others but many of them set up destructive decompositions yielding ele ments of fertility such as nitrogen and potassium and phosphorus compounds serving to sustain later generations of plants some of the earthsalts such as calcium compounds carried by the circula ting waters promote the flocculation of particles and the friability of the soils on which plant growth depends so that the primary law of the soil is one of cumulative enrichments through interac tion of the floras and faunas by means of the aqueous circulation In plants the irregular circulation and in animals the regular circulation are maintained chiefly by transpiration and respiration respectively i e by thepassage of the water from liquid to vapor and there is neither metabolism nor germination nor any other essentially vital action in the absence of water as the fundamental circulatory medium The circulation extends from the organism into the air above and the soil below with a degree of energy meas ured by evaporation condensation latency and affinity and the locus of most effective energizing on the planet is the infinitely complex surface of the soil with its component particles and its extensions 53 47The Annals of the American Academy in living organisms at which water is continually passing from one form to another in endless circulatory progression This surface the chief theater of organic activityis subject to human control partly through management of the soil partly through selection and modification of the organisms chiefly through regulation of the movements of the water derived from the rains and lodged in the subsurface reservoir Through control of this surface our entire water supply may be saved and applied to beneficial uses Our Most Urgent Needs Our stock of water is like other resources in that its quantity is fixed It differs from such mineral resources as coal and iron which once used are gone forever in that the supply is perpetual and it differs from such resources as soils and forests which are capable of renewal or increase provided the supply of water suf fices in that its quantity can not be augmented It differs also in that its relative quantity is too small to permit full development of other resources and of the population and industries depending on them Like all other resources it may be better utilized It must be better utilized in order to derive full benefit from lands and forests and mines Although our rainfall of 215ooo000000000oooooo000 cubic feet is 2500 ooo cubic feet per capita for a population of 86oooooo or 250000 cubic feet allowing for the ninety per cent waste our growth in population and industries is seriously retarded by dearth and misuse of water Fully a third of our territory Ioooooo square miles the area of Great Britain Germany France Spain Portugal Italy Austria and Denmark combined remains practically unoccupied and nearly unproductive by reason of aridity while the public lands sufficiently humid for agricultural settlement are taken the cost of transportation is limiting production and our citizens are emigrating in thousands to other countries With half our land area and the same water our capacity for population and industries would be as great as now with twice our water equally distributed over our present land our capacity would be more than doubled Hitherto water has seldom been regarded as a resource to be exploited and conserved it has been viewed vaguely as a prime necessity yet merely as a natural incident or providential blessing In its assumed plentitude the idea of quantity has seldom arisen 532 48Water as a Resource though the waste is least in those arid regions in which customs are better adjusted to the values and interrelations of water Under the English commonlaw prevailing in eastern United States the water is held appurtenant to the land under the Code Napoleon prevailing in Louisiana it virtually appertains to the community under the SpanishRoman law prevailing in western United States water is subject to prior appropriation and beneficial use and hence appertains primarily to the individual or family while the land is essentially appurtenant to the water traversing it Some States recognize a residuary right of the people in the natural waters or ir the headwaters of streams used for water supply or navigation and this recognition seems to be extending over the country but the usage of the different sections is not uniform the exercise of the right of the people generally varying with the aridity of the land or the density of the population In considering the benefits to be derived from the 215000000 Goo00000ooo cubic feet of water annually received the paramount use should be that of water supply next should follow navigation in humid regions and irrigation in arid regions The utilization of power from the navigable and source streams should be kept sub ordinate to the primary and secondary uses of the waters thouglh other things equal power development should be encouraged not only to reduce the drain on other resources but because properly designed reservoirs and power plants retard the runoff and so aid in the control of the streams for navigation and other uses It has been roughly estimated that the inland waterways of the country could be improved in ten years at a cost of 50oooooo annually in such manner as to promote interstate commerce and at the same time greatly reduce the waste and extend the use of the waters If done at the cost of the people the burden would be 0622 per capita per year or 625 in all for a population of 80000000 It is roughly estimated that the direct benefits would comprise an annual saving in transportation of 250000000 an annual sav ing in flood damage of I50000000 an average annual saving in forest fires of at least 25oooooo an annual benefit through cheapened power of fully 75000000 and an annual saving in soil erosion or corresponding benefit through increased farm produc tion of 500ooooooooa total of Iooooooooo or I250 per 533 49The Annals of the American Academy capita annually i e twenty times the cost In addition large bene fits would result from extended irrigation from the drainage and settlement of swamp and overflow land and from purified and cheapened water supply with consequent diminution of disease and saving of human life It is estimated that the income derived from power developed by works for the improvement of navigation if utilized at current market rates in cooperation with states and citizens would alone compensate the entire cost of maintenance and continued develop ment after the initial expenditure of 5ooooooou as a working capital 534 50

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1011671,WATER AS A RESOURCE,I242597,WATER AS A RESOURCE BY W J MCGEE LL D SECRETARY U S INLAND WATERWAYS COMMISSION MEMBER NATIONAL CONSERVATION COMMISSION WASHINGTON D C CURRENT TENDENCIES THIS IS AN AGE OF SCIENCE AND OURS A NATION OF SCIENCE OBSER VATION HAS MATURED IN MEASUREMENT AND PASSED FROM THE QUALITATIVE TO THE QUANTITATIVE GENERALIZATION IS A HABIT AND PREVISION HAS BE COME A COMMONPLACE IN CURRENT LIFE MORE THAN ALL ELSE THE COURSE OF NATURE HAS COME TO BE INVESTIGATED IN ORDER THAT IT MAY BE REDI RECTED ALONG LINES CONTRIBUTING TO HUMAN WELFARE INVENTION HAS BE COME A STEP TOWARD CREATION AND IS EXTENDING FAR BEYOND THE MERELY MECHANICAL AND INTO THE REALMS OF THE CHEMICAL AND EVEN THE VITAL NOW IS THE TIME OF CONQUEST OVER NATURE IN PRACTICAL SENSE OF PAN URGY IN PHILOSOPHIC SENSETHE DAY OF PROPHECY MADE PERFECT IN PREDETERMINED ACCOMPLISHMENT OUR COUNTRY IS GROWING RAPIDLY THE RATE VARIES ALONG DIFFERENT LINES OUR GROWTH IN AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION IS UNPRECEDENTED IN THE WORLDS HISTORY OUR GROWTH IN POPULATION IS SO MUCH MORE RAPID THAT EXPORTATION OF FOODSTUFFS IS DECLINING OUR GROWTH IN MINING OUTRUNS OUR INCREASE IN POPULATION OUR GROWTH IN MANUFACTURING FAR EXCEEDS THAT IN MINING AND OUR GROWTH IN APPLICATION OF MECHAN ICAL POWER IS MUCH MORE RAPID THAN OUR ADVANCE IN MANUFACTURING ALONG ONE LINE ONLY IS OUR GROWTH MORE RAPID THAN IN THE USE OF POWERI E IN THAT KNOWLEDGE AND MENTAL CAPACITY REQUIRED TO GUIDE AND DEVELOP THE MATERIAL PROGRESS OUR RATE OF MENTAL GROWTH IS NOT EASILY MEASURED IN THAT ITS MANIFESTATIONS ARE MANIFOLD IN I905 IT WAS POINTED OUT THAT ALONG THE SINGLE LINE OF UNIVERSITY DEVELOPMENT THE RATE OF ADVANCE IS GEOMETRICTHAT DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY OUR UNIVERSITY STRENGTH MEASURED IN ENDOWMENTS OR FACULTIES OR STU DENTS OR ALUMNI OR ALL COMBINED DOUBLED THAT DURING THE NEXT QUARTERCENTURY IT DOUBLED AGAIN THAT FROM I875 TO I890 IT DOUBLED AGAIN THAT IN THE NEXT DECADE IT ONCE MORE DOUBLED AND THAT WITHIN 52ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FIRST SEVEN YEARS OF THE PRESENT CENTURY IT WOULD INEVITABLY DOUBLE AGAIN NATURALLY SUCH WHELMING GROWTH CAN NOT CONTINUE INDEFINITELY ON ANY LINE YET THE ADVANCE CAN AND DOES CONTINUE LARGELY BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW LINES OR BY MULTIPLICATION OF THE OLD SO PATENTLY THAT IT IS SAFE TO CHARACTERIZE OUR PROGRESS IN KNOWLEDGE AND MENTAL POWER AS GEOMETRIC OUR GROWTH IN KNOWLEDGE OF THAT DEFINITE CHARACTER CALLED SCI ENCE IS NOTABLEPARTICULARLY IN ITS EVERMULTIPLYING APPLICATIONS TWENTYFIVE YEARS AGO THE WRITER COMPILED A GEOLOGIC MAP OF THE UNITED STATES THE FIRST BASED WHOLLY ON OBSERVATION AND NOT AT ALL ON INFERENCE AND ALTHOUGH A QUARTER OF THE AREA WAS LEFT BLANK IT WAS COMPLETE ENOUGH FOR PUBLICATION1 A YEAR LATER HE COMPILED THE FIRST MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF COAL IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH WAS FAIRLY COMPLETE FOR TWOTHIRDS OF OUR AREA YET SO INCOMPLETE FOR THE REMAINING THIRD AS NOT TO BE DEEMED WORTHY OF PUBLICATION THE FACTS THAT TODAY ANY GEOLOGIC MAP MAY BE MADE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE AND THAT OUR COAL DEPOSITS HAVE BEEN SURVEYED NOT ONLY AS TO AREA BUT AS TO VOLUME STRIKINGLY ILLUSTRATE THE RAPIDITY AND SURENESS OF OUR PROGRESS IN PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE WITH THE GROWTH OF SCIENCE ITS FIELD HAS EXTENDED AND ITS AGENCIES HAVE MULTIPLIED WHEN THE FEDERAL GEOLOGICAL SURVEY WAS STARTED AND THE STATE SURVEYS WERE REINVIGORATED ONLY THREE DECADES AGO THEY STOOD ALMOST ALONE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES ASIDE FROM THE LAND RECKONED IN AREA MERELY NOW THE SURVEYS HAVE GROWN AN ENTIRE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT AND CORRESPONDING STATE INSTRUMENTALITIES HAVE COME UP ON THE BASIS OF RESOURCES COMPRISING THE LAND AND ITS PRODUCTS AND POTENTIALITIES A WIDE RANGE OF MINERALS THE FORESTS WHICH PROTECT THE STREAMS AND OF LATE THE WATER ITSELF IT IS IN HARMONY WITH THE GENERAL DEVELOPMENT THAT THE QUANTITATIVE METHOD IS NOW APPLIED NOT ONLY TO SOIL PRODUCTION IN FORESTS AND CROPS AND TO MINE PRODUCTION AND MINERALS IN THE GROUND BUT FINALLY TO THE RAINS AND RIVERS WHICH RENDER THE LAND HABITABLE AND THE GROUND WATERS WHICH RENDER IT FRUITFUL NO MORE SIGNIFICANT ADVANCE HAS BEEN MADE IN OUR HISTORY THAN THAT OF THE LAST YEAR OR TWO IN WHICH OUR WATERS HAVE COME TO BE CONSIDERED AS A

THE ARID AND SEMIARID REGIONS IS USED FOR IRRIGATION PER 526 42WATER AS A RESOURCE HAPS FIVE PER CENT MAY BE RECKONED AS IN SMALL USE FOR NAVIGATION AND LESS THAN FIVE PER CENT IS UTILIZED FOR POWER IT IS ESTIMATED THAT EIGHTYFIVE PER CENT TO NINETYFIVE PER CENT OF THE VOLUME IS WASTED IN FRESHETS OR DESTRUCTIVE FLOODS IT IS RECKONED BY M 0 LEIGHTON CHIEF OF THE HYDROGRAPHIC BRANCH OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THAT FOR MUNICIPAL AND COMMUNITY WATER SUPPLY THERE ARE PROTECTED CATCHMENT AREAS AGGREGATING OVER IOOOOOO ACRES AND THAT FULLY 25OOOOOOO ARE INVESTED IN WATER WORKS WITH NEARLY AS

I3000000 ACRES EXCEPT IN SOME CASES THROUGH FORESTRY THERE IS LITTLE EFFORT TO CONTROL THE CATCHMENT AREAS AND FEW RESER VOIRS ARE LARGE ENOUGH TO HOLD THE STORM WATERS SO THAT THE WASTE IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PROJECTS EXCEEDS SIXTY PER CENT WHILE LESS THAN TWENTYEIGHT PER CENT OF THE WATER ACTUALLY AVAILABLE FOR IRRI GATION OF THE ARID LANDS IS RESTRAINED AND DIVERTED THERE ARE IN MAINLAND UNITED STATES 287 STREAMS NAVIGATED FOR AN AGGREGATE OF 26226 MILES3 AND ABOUT AN EQUAL ADDITIONAL MILEAGE MIGHT BE MADE NAVIGABLE BY WATERWAY IMPROVEMENT THERE ARE ALSO FORTYFIVE CANALS WITH A MILEAGE OF 2189 BESIDES NUMEROUS ABANDONED CANALS4 ON LAKE AND SOUND ROUTES THERE IS A LARGE TRAFFIC BUT THE NAVIGATION OF RIVERS AND CANALS IS TOO SMALL FOR DEFINITE RECORD SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS HAVE

LOCKS AND MOVABLE DAMS THERE HAS BEEN LITTLE EFFORT TO CONTROL HEADWATERS OR CATCHMENT AREAS IN THE INTERESTS OF NAVIGATION AND NONE OF OUR RIVERS ARE NAVIGATED TO MORE THAN A SMALL FRACTION EVEN OF THEIR EFFECTIVE LOWWATER CAPA CITY THE THEORETICAL POWER OF THE STREAMS IS RECKONED BY LEIGHTON ALT 230000000 HORSE POWER THE AMOUNT NOW USED IS COMPUTED BY THE CENSUS OFFICE AT 5230000 HORSE POWER AND THE AMOUNT RUNNING OVER GOVERNMENT DAMS AND NOT USED IS ESTIMATED BY THE CHIEF OF ENGINEERS AT ABOUT 1400000 HORSE POWER THE AMOUNT NOW AVAILABLE AT A COST COMPARABLE WITH THAT OF STEAM INSTALLATION IS ESTIMATED BY THE HYDROGRAPHIC BRANCH OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY AT 37OOOOOO HORSE POWER AND THE AMOUNT PROSPECTIVELY AVAILABLE AT 75000000 TO I50000000 HORSE POWER THE 3700O0000 HORSE POWER TODAY AVAILABLE EXCEEDS OUR ENTIRE MECHANICAL POWER NOW IN USE AND WOULD OPERATE EVERY MILL DRIVE EVERY SPINDLE PROPEL EVERY TRAIN AND BOAT AND LIGHT EVERY CITY TOWN AND VILLAGE IN THE COUNTRY THE NOMINAL VALUE IS 20 PER HORSEPOWER YEAR THE PRICE RANGES UP TO 100 OR I50 WHILE THE UTILIZATION OF WATER POWER RANKS AMONG OUR MOST RECENT AND MOST RAPID INDUSTRIAL DEVELOPMENTS LITTLE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO CONTROL CATCHMENT AREAS OR STORM WATERS IN ANY LARGE WAY FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT THOUGH MOST PLANTS EFFECT LOCAL CONTROL THROUGH RESERVOIRS AND STRUCTURES NEARLY ALL OF THE FRESHET AND FLOOD WATER RUNS TO WASTE AND THE LOW WATERS WHICH LIMIT THE EFFICIENCY OF POWER PLANTS ARE INCREASING IN FREQUENCY AND DURATION WITH THE INCREASING FLOOD RUNOFF THE PRACTICAL UTILITY OF STREAMS FOR BOTH NAVIGATION AND POWER IS MEASURED BY THE EFFECTIVE LOWWATER STAGE THE VOLUME CARRIED WHEN THE STREAMS RISE ABOVE THIS STAGE SEVENTYFIVE TO NINETY PER 5PRELIMINARY REPORT OF THE INLAND WATERWAYS COMMISSION 1909 MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT PAGE VI 528 44WATER AS A RESOURCE CENT OF THE RUNOFF IS NOT ONLY WASTED BUT DOES SERIOUS DAMAGE THE DIRECT YEARLY DAMAGE BY FLOODS SINCE 900OO AS COMPUTED BY LEIGHTON HAS INCREASED STEADILY FROM 45000000 TO 238OOOOOO THE INDIRECT LOSS THROUGH DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY IS PROBABLY GREATER WHILE THE LARGEST LOSS IS THAT ARISING IN IMPEDED NAVIGATION AND TERMINAL TRANSFERS THE FRESHETS ARE ATTENDED BY DESTRUCTIVE SOIL EROSION THE SOIL MATTER ANNUALLY CARRIED INTO LOWER RIVERS AND HARBORS OR INTO THE SEA HAS RECENTLY BEEN RECKONED BY DOLE AND STABLER AT 7830OOO OOO TONS ITS REMOVAL SERIOUSLY REDUCES THE PRODUCTIVITY OF UPLAND FARMS AND INCREASES CHANNELCUTTING AND BARBUILDING IN THE RIVERS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SOIL EROSION REDUCES FARM PRODUCTION TEN TO TWENTY PER CENT THAT ANNUAL LOSS TO FARMS ALONE IS 500000000 AND THAT LARGE LOSSES FOLLOW THE FOULING OF THE WATERS AND THE DIMIN ISHED NAVIGABILITY OF THE STREAMS THROUGH IMPERFECT CONTROL OF THE RUNNING WATERS LOWLANDS ARE TEMPORARILY OR PERMANENTLY FLOODED IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE IN MAINLAND UNITED STATES 75000OOO TO 80OOOOOO ACRES OF OVER FLOW AND SWAMP LANDS REQUIRING DRAINAGE THAT BY SYSTEMATIC OPERA TIONS THESE MIGHT BE DRAINED AND THE WATER MADE AVAILABLE AT MOD ERATE EXPENSE AND THAT THEY WOULD THEN BE WORTH TWO OR THREE TIMES THE PRESENT VALUE AND COST OF DRAINAGE AND WOULD FURNISH HOMES FOR 10000000 INHABITANTS A PART OF THE RUNOFF LODGES TEMPORARILY IN LAKES AND PONDS IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE QUANTITY OF FRESH WATER SO STORED INCLUDING THE AMERICAN PORTION OF THE GREAT LAKES IS ABOUT 600000000000 OOO CUBIC FEET 45OOO CUBIC MILES 28O000000000OOO KILOSTERES EQUIVALENT TO THREE YEARS RAINFALL OR NINE YEARS RUNOFF THE NATURAL RESERVOIRS YIELD A WATER SUPPLY ORDINARILY REQUIRING NO CONTROL OF CATCHMENT AREA SOME 6OOOOOO OF OUR PEOPLE DRAW THEIR WATER SUPPLY FROM LAKES ALL THE LARGER AND DEEPER LAKES ARE NAVIGATED THEY SERVE THE CHIEF PART OF OUR INLAND COMMERCE BY WATER THE CUTOFF OF THE THIRTYFIVE TRILLION 35OOOOOO0OOOOO CUBIC FEET 250 CUBIC MILES IOOOOOOOO000 KILOSTERES OF CUTOFF THE CHIEF SHARE IS ABSORBED BY SOIL AND EARTH OR CONSUMED BY NATURAL PROCESSES OR THROUGH AGRICULTURE AND RELATED INDUSTRIES YET MOST OF IT RETURNS TO THE ORIGINAL SUPPLY BY NATURAL CIRCULATION 529 45THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ON AN AVERAGE THE PLANT TISSUE OF ANNUAL GROWTHS IS THREE FOURTHS AND OF PERENNIAL GROWTHS THREEEIGHTHS WATER OF HUMAN AND STOCK FOOD OVER EIGHTY PER CENT IS WATER AND IN ANIMAL TISSUE THE RATIO IS ABOUT THE SAME AND IS THE CHIEF VEHICLE FOR THE TRANS MISSION OF ENTERIC AND MANY OTHER DISEASES SINCE WATER IS THE ES SENTIAL CIRCULATORY MEDIUM IN ORGANIC BODIES THE PLANTS AND ANIMALS OF THE COUNTRY YEARLY REQUIRE AN AMOUNT MANY TIMES EXCEEDING THEIR AGGREGATE VOLUME THE AVERAGE MAN OF 150 POUNDS INGESTS OVER A TON 9OO LITERS THIRTYTWO CUBIC FEET OR THIRTEEN TIMES HIS VOLUME OF WATER EACH YEAR AND AN AVERAGE BUSHEL OF CORN REQUIRES OVER 700 CUBIC FEET TWENTY KILOLITERS OR TWENTYTWO TONS OF WATER IN THE MAKINGOF WHICH THE LARGER PART IS EVAPORATED EVEN IN THE MORE HUMID SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY THE PRODUCTIVITY OF THE SOIL AND THE POSSIBLE HUMAN POPULATION WOULD BE MUCH LARGER IF THE RAINFALL WERE GREATER LEAVING A WIDER MARGIN FOR ORGANIC AND OTHER CHEMICAL USES EXCEPT THROUGH IRRIGATION LITTLE GENERAL EFFORT IS MADE TO CONTROL THE NATURAL CIRCULATION THOUGH SOME FARMERS IN ARID REGIONS CLAIM TO DOUBLE OR TRIPLE THE CROP FROM GIVEN SOIL BY SUPPLYING WATER JUST WHEN NEEDED AND WITHHOLDING IT WHEN NOT REQUIRED THE GREATER PART OF THE CUTOFF LODGES TEMPORARILY IN THE SOIL AND EARTH AS GROUND WATER ACCORDING TO TEXTURE FIREDRY ROCKS CONTAIN ONE TO THREE PER CENT AIRDRY ROCKS FIVE TO TWENTYFIVE PER CENT AND SATURATED ROCKS AND EARTHS TEN TO FORTY PER CENT OF WATER WHILE THE OPTIMUM MOISTURE FOR PLANT GROWTH IN TOPSOIL RANGES FROM FOUR TO TWENTY PER CENT AND IT IS ESTIMATED THAT THE GROUND WATER TO THE DEPTH OF IOO00 FEET IN WHICH IT IS AVAILABLE FOR HAND PUMPS AND CAPILLARITY AND DEEPROOTED TREES AVERAGES FIVE PER CENT OVER IOOOOOO SQUARE MILES TWENTY PER CENT OVER ANOTHER THIRD OF THE COUNTRY AND TWENTYFIVE PER CENT OVER THE REMAINING THIRD A MEAN OF I6 23 PER CENT THIS GROUND WATER MAY BE CONCEIVED AS A SUBSURFACE RESERVOIR 3000000 SQUARE MILES IN AREA AND NEARLY SEVENTEEN FEET DEEP

MOST OTHER INDUSTRIES AND THE CHIEF NATURAL RESOURCE OF THE COUNTRY IT SUSTAINS FORESTS AND ALL OTHER CROPS AND SUPPLIES THE PERENNIAL STREAMS AND SPRINGS AND WELLS USED BY FOUR FIFTHS OF OUR POPULATION AND NEARLY ALL OUR DOMESTIC ANIMALS ITS QUANTITY IS DIMINISHEL BY THE INCREASED RUNOFF DUE TO DEFORESTATION 530 46WATER AS A RESOURCE AND INJUDICIOUS FARMING THROUGHOUT THE UPLAND PORTIONS OF EASTERN UNITED STATES THE AVERAGE WATERTABLE HAS BEEN LOWERED TEN TO FORTV FEET SO THAT FULLY THREEFOURTHS OF THE SPRINGS AND SHALLOWER WELLS HAVE FAILED AND MANY BROOKS HAVE RUN DRY WHILE THE RISK OF CROP LOSS BY DROUGHT HAS PROPORTIONATELY INCREASED AND THE WASTE THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI HAS INCREASED OVER FIFTEEN PER CENT ALTHOUGH THE AVAILABLE GROUND WATER IS SUBJECT TO CONTROL BY SUCH TREATMENT OF SOIL AND PLANT GROWTH AS TO PREVENT FRESHETS LITTLE EFFORT HAS BEEN MADE TO RETAIN IT OR INCREASE ITS VOLUME AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT FULLY TEN PER CENT OF RICH RESOURCE HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO DRAIN AWAY SINCE SETTLEMENT BEGAN THE WATER OF THE DEEPER ROCKS BELOW 100 FEET SUPPLIES ARTESIAN AND OTHER DEEP WELLS MOST THERMAL AND MIN ERAL WATERS AND MANY LARGE SPRINGS IT MAY BE CONTROLLED IN PART THROUGH THE SUBSURFACE RESERVOIR AND MIGHT BE MUCH BETTER UTILIZED IN BOTH GROUND AND ORGANISMS THE WATER EXCEPT WHEN FROZEN IS IN CONSTANT MOVEMENT IN THE SOIL IT MOVES UNDER GRAVITY AND CAPILLARITY DISSOLVES EARTHSALTS AND CONVEYS THEM INTO AND THROUGH THE CIRCULATORY SYSTEMS OF LIVING PLANTS AND THEN CARRIES THE KATASTATES OF GROWTH AND DECAY INTO THE AIR OR BACK INTO THE EARTH MATTER TO HASTEN ITS SOLUTION SOME OF THE ORGANIC DERIVATIVES ARE EXCRETORY AND POISONOUS TO THE PLANTS YIELDING THEM OR TO OTHERS BUT MANY OF THEM SET UP DESTRUCTIVE DECOMPOSITIONS YIELDING ELE MENTS OF FERTILITY SUCH AS NITROGEN AND POTASSIUM AND PHOSPHORUS COMPOUNDS SERVING TO SUSTAIN LATER GENERATIONS OF PLANTS SOME OF THE EARTHSALTS SUCH AS CALCIUM COMPOUNDS CARRIED BY THE CIRCULA TING WATERS PROMOTE THE FLOCCULATION OF PARTICLES AND THE FRIABILITY OF THE SOILS ON WHICH PLANT GROWTH DEPENDS SO THAT THE PRIMARY LAW OF THE SOIL IS ONE OF CUMULATIVE ENRICHMENTS THROUGH INTERAC TION OF THE FLORAS AND FAUNAS BY MEANS OF THE AQUEOUS CIRCULATION IN PLANTS THE IRREGULAR CIRCULATION AND IN ANIMALS THE REGULAR CIRCULATION ARE MAINTAINED CHIEFLY BY TRANSPIRATION AND RESPIRATION RESPECTIVELY I

PARTLY THROUGH SELECTION AND MODIFICATION OF THE ORGANISMS CHIEFLY THROUGH REGULATION OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE WATER DERIVED FROM THE RAINS AND LODGED IN THE SUBSURFACE RESERVOIR THROUGH CONTROL OF THIS SURFACE OUR ENTIRE WATER SUPPLY MAY BE SAVED AND APPLIED TO BENEFICIAL USES OUR MOST URGENT NEEDS OUR STOCK OF WATER IS LIKE OTHER RESOURCES IN THAT ITS QUANTITY IS FIXED IT DIFFERS FROM SUCH MINERAL RESOURCES AS COAL AND IRON WHICH ONCE USED ARE GONE FOREVER IN THAT THE SUPPLY IS PERPETUAL AND IT DIFFERS FROM SUCH RESOURCES AS SOILS AND FORESTS WHICH ARE CAPABLE OF RENEWAL OR INCREASE PROVIDED THE SUPPLY OF WATER SUF FICES IN THAT ITS QUANTITY CAN NOT BE AUGMENTED IT DIFFERS ALSO IN THAT ITS RELATIVE QUANTITY IS TOO SMALL TO PERMIT FULL DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER RESOURCES AND OF THE POPULATION AND INDUSTRIES DEPENDING ON THEM LIKE ALL OTHER RESOURCES IT MAY BE BETTER UTILIZED IT MUST BE BETTER UTILIZED IN ORDER TO DERIVE FULL BENEFIT FROM LANDS AND FORESTS AND MINES ALTHOUGH OUR RAINFALL OF 215OOO000000000OOOOOO000 CUBIC FEET IS 2500 OOO CUBIC FEET PER CAPITA FOR A POPULATION OF 86OOOOOO OR 250000 CUBIC FEET ALLOWING FOR THE NINETY PER CENT WASTE OUR GROWTH IN POPULATION AND INDUSTRIES IS SERIOUSLY RETARDED BY DEARTH AND MISUSE OF WATER FULLY A THIRD OF OUR TERRITORY IOOOOOO SQUARE MILES THE AREA OF GREAT BRITAIN GERMANY FRANCE SPAIN PORTUGAL ITALY AUSTRIA AND DENMARK COMBINED REMAINS PRACTICALLY UNOCCUPIED AND NEARLY UNPRODUCTIVE BY REASON OF ARIDITY WHILE THE PUBLIC LANDS SUFFICIENTLY HUMID FOR AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENT ARE TAKEN THE COST OF TRANSPORTATION IS LIMITING PRODUCTION AND OUR CITIZENS ARE EMIGRATING IN THOUSANDS TO OTHER COUNTRIES WITH HALF OUR LAND AREA AND THE SAME WATER OUR CAPACITY FOR POPULATION AND INDUSTRIES WOULD BE AS GREAT AS NOW WITH TWICE OUR WATER EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED OVER OUR PRESENT LAND OUR CAPACITY WOULD BE MORE THAN DOUBLED HITHERTO WATER HAS SELDOM BEEN REGARDED AS A RESOURCE TO BE EXPLOITED AND CONSERVED IT HAS BEEN VIEWED VAGUELY AS A PRIME NECESSITY YET MERELY AS A NATURAL INCIDENT OR PROVIDENTIAL BLESSING IN ITS ASSUMED PLENTITUDE THE IDEA OF QUANTITY HAS SELDOM ARISEN 532 48WATER AS A RESOURCE THOUGH THE WASTE IS LEAST IN THOSE ARID REGIONS IN WHICH CUSTOMS ARE BETTER ADJUSTED TO THE VALUES AND INTERRELATIONS OF WATER UNDER THE ENGLISH COMMONLAW PREVAILING IN EASTERN UNITED STATES THE WATER IS HELD APPURTENANT TO THE LAND UNDER THE CODE NAPOLEON PREVAILING IN LOUISIANA IT VIRTUALLY APPERTAINS TO THE COMMUNITY UNDER THE SPANISHROMAN LAW PREVAILING IN WESTERN UNITED STATES WATER IS SUBJECT TO PRIOR APPROPRIATION AND BENEFICIAL USE AND HENCE APPERTAINS PRIMARILY TO THE INDIVIDUAL OR FAMILY WHILE THE LAND IS ESSENTIALLY APPURTENANT TO THE WATER TRAVERSING IT SOME STATES RECOGNIZE A RESIDUARY RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE IN THE NATURAL WATERS OR IR THE HEADWATERS OF STREAMS USED FOR WATER SUPPLY OR NAVIGATION AND THIS RECOGNITION SEEMS TO BE EXTENDING OVER THE COUNTRY BUT THE USAGE OF THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS IS NOT UNIFORM THE EXERCISE OF THE RIGHT OF THE PEOPLE GENERALLY VARYING WITH THE ARIDITY OF THE LAND OR THE DENSITY OF THE POPULATION IN CONSIDERING THE BENEFITS TO BE DERIVED FROM THE 215000000 GOO00000OOO CUBIC FEET OF WATER ANNUALLY RECEIVED THE PARAMOUNT USE SHOULD BE THAT OF WATER SUPPLY NEXT SHOULD FOLLOW NAVIGATION IN HUMID REGIONS AND IRRIGATION IN ARID REGIONS THE UTILIZATION OF POWER FROM THE NAVIGABLE AND SOURCE STREAMS SHOULD BE KEPT SUB ORDINATE TO THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY USES OF THE WATERS THOUGLH OTHER THINGS EQUAL POWER DEVELOPMENT SHOULD BE ENCOURAGED NOT ONLY TO REDUCE THE DRAIN ON OTHER RESOURCES BUT BECAUSE PROPERLY DESIGNED RESERVOIRS AND POWER PLANTS RETARD THE RUNOFF AND SO AID IN THE CONTROL OF THE STREAMS FOR NAVIGATION AND OTHER USES IT HAS BEEN ROUGHLY ESTIMATED THAT THE INLAND WATERWAYS OF THE COUNTRY COULD BE IMPROVED IN TEN YEARS AT A COST OF 50OOOOOO ANNUALLY IN SUCH MANNER AS TO PROMOTE INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND AT THE SAME TIME GREATLY REDUCE THE WASTE AND EXTEND THE USE OF THE WATERS IF DONE AT THE COST OF THE PEOPLE THE BURDEN WOULD BE 0622 PER CAPITA PER YEAR OR 625 IN ALL FOR A POPULATION OF 80000000 IT IS ROUGHLY

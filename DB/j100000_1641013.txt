latter type is found in Chlamydomonas Daphnia the larve of barnacles and other organisms the former type exists in Euglena Eudendrium the seedlings of oats and others It seems of interest to call attention to the fact that according to the measurements of Trendelenburg the visual purple in the eye of the rabbit is bleached most rapidly by light of the wavelength X 536 j As Kuehne had already shown visual purple is not affected by red light and only feebly by yellow light The relative efficiency of different parts of the spectrum for the heliotropic reactions of Chlamydomonas coincides therefore approxi mately with the relative bleaching power of rays of different wavelengths for visual purple This makes it almost appear as if in the one group of organisms namely those which be have like Daphnia or Chlamydomonas the heliotropic reactions were determined by a sub stance or by substances which behave in regard to photosensitiveness like visual purple and which may possibly be identical with visual purple This assumption allows us to explain the heliotropic reactions of lower organisms with out arbitrarily ascribing to them sensations of brightness the existence of which can in their case not be proved And furthermore when the heliotropic effect of rays of different wavelengths upon lower organisms is found to run parallel to their effect upon the bleach ing of visual purple as it does in Daphnia and Chlamydomonas it seems more rational and promising to conclude that the heliotrop ism in these cases is caused by a substance or substances which behave photochemically like visual purple than that these lower organisms suffer from total colorblindness We have already shown in our first note that the theory of heliotropic orientation is independent of the relative efficiency of different wavelengths We may summarize the results of our experi ments in the following way 1 The validity of the BunsenRoscoe law for the heliotropic reactions of certain and possibly all plants and animals suggests that these reactions are due to a chemical action of the light 2 There seem to exist two types of helio tropic substances one with a maximum of sensitiveness or absorption in the yellowish green near X 534 p8q and the second with a maximum of sensitiveness in the blue near A 47 4 t j Visual purple is a representa tive of the former type 3 The photosensitive substance of the visual purple type occurs in the protozoan Chlamy domonas which is usually stated to be a plant in Daphnia and many other organisms The photosensitive substance with the maximal sensitiveness in the blue is found in Euglena in many plants and in certain animals e g Eudendrium and probably others5 4 It would therefore be wrong to state that the one type of photosensitive substances is found exclusively in plants and the other ex clusively in animals As a matter of fact they are distributed independently of the syste matic boundaries between the two groups of organisms 5 It is immaterial for the theory of helio tropism to which of the two types the photo sensitive substance in any given heliotropic organism belongs JACQUES LOEB HARDOLPH WASTENEYS THE ROCKEFELLER INSTITUTE FOR MEDICAL RESEARCH NEW YORK AMERICAN ASSOCIATION FOR THE AD VANCEMENT OF SCIENCE SECTION M AGRICULTURE THE first meeting of Section M Agriculture of the American Association for the Advancement of Science was held in the Engineering Building of the University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia De cember 30 1914 The inauguration of the new section was par ticularly auspicious and the large attendance was encouraging as indicating wide interest Dr Charles W Eliot president of the Association presided at the opening of the meeting and in a brief address called attention to the great impor tance of the agricultural industry and expressed 5 This seems to be indicated by the work of Parker and his pupils 330 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 26 1915 his gratification at the provision of the section It is high time he said that we began to attend to the building up of American agriculture and to recognize its basis in science Ite expressed his special interest in the teaching of agricul ture on account of the opportunity it offered for furthering the teaching of natural sciences in the schools This he declared is the great reform needed in American education The popular in terest now aroused in agricultural teaching offers an entering wedge in this direction and gives hope for the accomplishment of even greater re forms Countrylife development Dr Eliot pro nounced one of the greatest humanitarian move ments of this age  Our race can not endure urban life and the factory system he said the ill effects of it have already been seen I Hence anything that leads men into the country where they may lead a wholesome existence is contrib uting to a necessarily humanitarian movement7 These remarks furnished an appropriate intro duction to the vicepresidential address of Pro fessor L H Bailey on The Place of Research and of Publicity in the Forthcoming Country Life Development The address was essen tially a plea for the principles of democracy ap proached from the standpoint of the public serv ice institutions for agriculture and especially the new national work for agricultural extension The other feature of the meeting was a syni posium devoted to The Field of Rural Econom ies This was participated in by four speak ers who dealt with several phases of the general subject In opening the subject Hion Carl Vroo man Assistant Secretary of Agriculture discussed l Rural Economies from the Standpoint of the Farmer Ie corrected some of the false impres sions as to the advantages of high acre yields pointing out that the plain business question is not how much the farmer could produce if he had no regard for the cost but how much he can af ford to produce under present American condi tions He showed by statistics that the largest crops do not necessarily mean the largest net in come to the farmer and that in years of relatively small production he often realizes quite as much from his crops as in years of maximum yield Secretary Vrooman laid much emphasis on the importance of the problems of distribution and marketing enforcing his remarks by illustrations from his own experience as a farmer While ad mitting the necessity for middlemen and other in termediaries he protested against any allied in terest taking more than a legitimate profit from the farmer He declared that the average farmer is only making wages he is not making a profit over his wages and the interest on his invest ment Until the problems of agricultural eco nomics are solved there is little encouragement for him in attempting to raise larger crops Eco nomic justice to the farmer and producing classes he said  must be the basis of the higher civilization which we picture In discussing Credit and Agriculture Pro fessor G N LauLman of Cornell University maintained that in this country credit has not been generally available to the farmer except at a considerable premium and that in order to de velop American agriculture and rural life it must be made feasible for a man to be successively a farm laborer a farm renter and a farm owner Shorttime credit was held to be a distinctly local matter The community should rally all its capi tal to develop itself and should organize to furnish the basis for a closer association between itself and existing banking and credit facilities The great social and ethical gains from the small credit unions of Europe was explained especially in help ing the small farmer In ofder to bring outside capital into agriculture it is necessary to meet the demands which such cap ital makes Credit it was declared has no better basis than farm values made fluid Rightly developed bonds based on land mortgages have no superiors in the investment field These it was explained should be of small enough denomina tions to be accessible to all classes and available on all exchanges But the prevalent machinery for this is too expensive a burden on agriculture Professor Lauman did not advocate leaving the problem to either the government or to private capital for solution but urged organization If agriculture organized to make it possible to de mand the lowest rates of interest the market af fords can not live and develop not even state aid will prevent its ultimate decay In a paper on Marketing and Distribution Problems Mr C J Brand of the Department of Agriculture presented the needs of the farmer in the way of assistance in establishing a market system which will return to him the true value of the various crops he produces minus reasonable charges for handling transportation and the legiti mate profits of middlemen He outlined the vari ous lines of study which are being pursued by the Office of Markets and Rural Organization These are concerned in part with a study of conditions

followed through from the producer to the consumer with statistical studies of supply and demand Market grades and stand ards are also being investigated with the object of effecting greater uniformity and transporta tion and storage as to methods the adequacy of facilities and the relation of warehousing refrig eration etc to prices and to stabilizing supplies Market surveys are being made with a view to collecting facts and developing methods for bring ing useful information in regard to prices and supplies promptly to producers and consumers The practise in vogue in marketing and distribu tion in large cities is the subject of a special in quiry to make comparisons and arrive at the most advantageous plans Direct dealing through marketing by parcel post and by express is being studied not only as to practicability and advan tages but as to systems for bringing producers and consumers into contact and establishing their busi ness relationships Cooperative buying and selling naturally attracts considerable attention with in quiry into the methods and success of organiza tions and the supplying of assistance in organiza tion systems of accounting auditing etc The partial enumeration of these lines of effort illustrated some of the problems in marketing Prom a consideration of cotton handling and marketing Mr Brand showed that the acute problems are not confined to perishable crops The cantaloupe trade was cited to show an overde velopment of the industry due to ignorance as to the development of competitive areas which in 1914 resulted in disaster to the producers and to the large distributors As usual the slump in prices was not reflected in the retail trade con sumers paying practically as much as in a year of scarcity while the surplus went to the dump The conclusion is that until we have a more complete system of information and a better adjustment of production to market requirements this problem will continue to be with us Cooperation was not regarded as necessarily the panacea for all marketing troubles Organization was favored but alone it is not sufficient it must be accompanied by skilful and intelligent manage ment To protect shippers from imposition and misrepresentation at large markets and terminals a licensed inspection system was suggested and il lustrations of the use it could serve were cited  The Distinction Between Efficiency in Produc tion and Efficiency in Bargaining was well illus trated by Dr T N Carver of Harvard University He explained that every legitimate business is made up of two parts one of which may be called producing including any handling of the material which renders it more usable or useful and the other bargaining i e buying and selling borrow ing and lending Many of the supposed economies of largescale business turn out upon examination to be advantages in bargaining rather than econ omies in production In most lines of business there is a certain size which gives the maximum efficiency in production and also in bargaining These do not necessarily coincide but as a rule the size which gives the maximum efficiency in bar gaining is larger than that for production In agriculture the most efficient producing unit was said to be the onefamily farm provided with the best teams tools and general equipment This gives the highest average product man for man If the large farmer is able to command some spe cial advantages in securing cheap labor he may beat the small farmer in competition with him but this is advantage in bargaining His profit may be larger in spite of the lower average productiv ity of the persons engaged The foisting upon the lural districts of a large supply of cheap labor is designed to give the large farmer an advantage in purchasing his labor Again it was pointed out that in buying his sup plies and in selling his products especially if they are perishable the large farmer usually has an ad vantage The small farmer of the present day is the only large class which regularly buys its raw material at retail and sells its finished product at wholesale This can be overcome by collective bargaining or cooperation which may give the small farmer the same advantages which the large farmer enjoys and the same is true in borrowing capital Hence for the small farmer who appears to be efficient in production organization into larger units was urged to overcome inefficiency in buying and selling Dean E Davenport of the University of Illinois was elected vicepresident and chairman of the sec tion for the ensuing year Dr A C True of the

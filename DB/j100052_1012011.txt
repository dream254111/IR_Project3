of Pennsylvania Several recent inquiries conducted by private agencies and by public authorities into the cost of a decent or fair living have reached very similar conclusions Accepting for the purpose of discussion a unit family of five members a man wife and three children under fourteen and a normal standard as one providing 22 cents per adult man per day for food three rooms for the family of five 105 per year for the family clothing and laundry and an amount for food and light carfare health recreation and sundries equal to onefifth of the total expenditures Dr R C Chapin concludes his New York study with the statement that An income under 800 is not enough to permit the maintenance of a normal standard  On the other hand an income of 900 or over probably permits the maintenance of a normal standard at least so far as the physical man is concerned  Whether an income between 800 and 900 can be made to suffice is a ques tion to which our data do not warrant a dogmatic answer  Data from other cities are very inadequate but such facts as are available indicate that it costs as much to live in Pittsburgh as it does in New York that in Baltimore the minimum is 750 and that in Philadelphia Boston and Buffalo it is somewhere between 750 and 900 A recent federal study published in 1911 relating to small towns comes to the conclusion that in Fall River The total cost of the fair standard for the English Irish and Canadian French family is 73199 and for the Portuguese Polish or Italian family it is 69095 2 1 R C Chapin The Standard of Living of

Government Printing Office 1911 41THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY In small Georgia and South Carolina mill towns The father must earn 60075 in order to support himself according to a standard which will enable him to furnish them good nourishing food and sufficient plain clothing He can send his children to school Unless a prolonged or serious illness befall the family he can pay for medical attention If a death should occur insurance will meet the expense He can provide some simple recreation for his family the cost not to be over 1560 for the year If this cottonmill father is givenemploy ment 300 days out of the year he must earn 2 per day to maintain this standard As the children grow older and the family increases in size the cost of living will naturally increase The father must either earn more himself or be assisted by his young children3 It is therefore fair to conclude that from 600 to 900 per year 2 to 3 per working dayis the minimum amount necessary to enable a man wife and three children to maintain a normal standard of liv ing in the industrial sections in the eastern part of the United States Statements of the cost of a decent standard of living are mani festly unsatisfactory unless they can be contrasted with some analysis of the incomes which American families receive Aside from a few scattering inquiries no attempt has been made to determine the size of family income but several studies have been made which show pretty conclusively that the great bulk of family income is derived from the earnings of the father alone For example among the New York families which Chapin considered to be living on a fair standard the earnings of the father furnished 85 per cent of the income The remaining 15 per cent was made up from the earnings of other members of the family the receipts from boarders and lodgers and miscellaneous sources of family income4 The conclusion from these and other available facts seems to be that a young familyconsisting of a man wife and three children under fourteenis largely dependent on the earnings of the father What does the father earn Passing without further emphasis the oftrepeated statement that the statistics of average wages are meaningless there remains a limited body of data giving the classified wages of adult males from which certain wage conclusions may be made Twice during the past ten years these facts have been sum Ibid pp 15253 4 R C Chapin The Standard of Living of Workingmens Families in New York City p 63 42WAGES IN THE UNITED STATES marized at the end of rather elaborate studies The latest of these studies dealing with the period about 1904 contains the following paragraph at the end of a brilliant discussion of the Distribution of Wages 5 In view of this consideration and of the general harmony of the statistics presented in this chapter it is reasonable to believe that in 1904 something over 60 per cent of the males at least sixteen years of age employed in manufac turing mining trade transportation and a few other occupations associated with industrial life were earning less than 626 per annum about 30 per cent were receiving 626 but under 1044 and perhaps 10 per cent enjoyed labor incomes of at least 1000 If to these the agriculturists are added 65 per cent fall in the lowearnings group 27 in the medium and 8 in the high Suppose all the men engaged in gainful occupations in 1904 but unaccounted for in this estimate to have been paid 12 per week or more This is manifestly im possible yet even upon such an assumption fully onehalf of the adult males engaged in remunerative labor were rewarded that year with less than 626 These figures made no allowance at all for unemployment The weekly wage is simply multiplied by 52 to derive the annual earnings In the second study to which reference has been made a reduction of 20 per cent is made for unemployment when the annual earnings are computed After a careful analysis of the available data this study concludes  With one exception Bell Telephone Company these statistics are remark ably uniform About onehalf of the adult males included receive less than 12 per week 600 per year while less than onetenth receive wages of more than 1000 per year The Bell Telephone Company a relatively highclass in dustry employing almost no unskilled help reports 20 per cent of its employees as receiving more than 1000 With this one exception all of the reports are on practical agreement Did these statistics emanate from one source or were they based on one investigation or derived through one statistical method they might possibly be open to question but coming as they do from six separate authorities from states as far separated as Massachusetts and Wisconsin from the Interstate Commerce Commission and from the inspection by the Depart ment of Commerce and Labor of the payrolls of the telephone and Bethlehem companies their agreement permits of but one conclusionthat these seven reports give an accurate measure of the wages of adult males in the industries of the United States 5 F H Streightoff The Distribution of Incomes in the United States New

that vital question What are wages For the available sources of statistics and by inference for neighboring localities the annual earnings unemployment of 20 per cent deducted of adult males employed east of the Rockies and north of the Mason and Dixon Line are distributed over the wage scale thus Annual Earnings Adult Males U nder 325   110 U nder 500  1 2 U nder 600 3 4 U nder 800    910 Since the publication of these studies the conclusions of which are remarkably uniform the federal government has published a most elaborate investigation into the wages of the workers in the iron and steel industry of the United States7 Among 172 706 employees 1629 per cent received less than 14 cents per hour 6596 per cent received less than 18 cents per hour 9230 per cent received less than 25 cents per hour Bearing in mind the fact that the equivalent in weekly wage for 14 cents per hour approximately 10 per week 18 cents per hour approximately 15 per week 25 cents per hour approximately 20 per week the reader will observe that the wages in the steel industry conform almost exactly to the conclusions reached in the two wage studies noted above That the conclusions presented in these studies are close to the real facts can no longer be seriously questioned That the wages which they reveal fail in a large proportion of the cases to meet the demand of decent family standards seems equally incontrovertible 7 Chas P Neill Summary of Wages and Hours Senate Doc 301 62 Cong 2 sess 1912 p 19 44

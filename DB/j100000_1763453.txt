interesting article on  The Policeman as an Autocrat and Clubbing and its Effects by Capt Gunner of the New York police Mr Gladstone has an article in the JZneZeenZh CenZury for July entitled  Plain Speaking on the Irish Union In it he says Sir Richard Webster in examining William OBrien before the Parnell Commission implied that a grave charge would be proved against certain Ilishmen if itcould be shown that they regarded English power as alien I should like to have asked Mr OBrien whetherthe Irish so far as he knew regarded the Act of Union as possessed of the same moral authority as the laws against theft and murder or as possessed of moral authority at all I do not doubt that Mr OBrien would have answered that they regarded it as an act of force to which Ireland was under not a moral but only a prudential obligation to conform There may be immorality in miscalculated resistance even to immoral laws it such resistance is not in itself immoral The question is whether worship of the Act of Union is piety or superstition Mr George John Romanes the distinguished author of  Men tal Evolution in Man Origin of Human Faculty will contribute to The Open Coxr of July I I Chicago an article entitled  The Psychic Life of MicroOrganisms The public will recall M Binets able series of essays in Vol II of The Open Cowrt in which the soullife of these tiny and interesting beings was

Combined WaterMotor and Dynamo A COMPACT combination of a watermotor with an electric gen erator now being placed on the market by the Belknap Water Motor Company of Portland Me is shown in the accompanying illustration It is intended for small plants of from ten to fifty or more I6candlepower lamps In the engraving the dynamo and a pressure of twentyfive or thirty pounds may be had at a reason able price these motors ranging in size from seven to twelve inches in diameter are successfully running printingpresses lathes saws jewellers and dental tools organs sewingmacllines and coffee spice and drug mills Graduated Glassware and Bohemian Beakers James W Queen  Co Philadelphia have recently made ar rangements for the manufacture of chemical glassware of fine quality and call particular attention to the accuracy of their gradu ated ware such as burettes pipettes volumetric flasks cylinders etc These goods are made abroad by experienced workmen of the best German glass In order to satisfy themselves still further as well as their cus tomers as to the quality of the apparatus they selected at random a number of each of the articles mentioned above and sent them to William H Greene professor of chemistry in the Philadelphia Central High School asking him to submit them to a compari son with his  standard instruments made by Geissler of Bonn The results of these tesYs as shown in a letter from Professor Greene are highly satisfactory A Rubber Mat for TypeWriters A useful device manufactured by the United Rubber Company of Trenton NJ is shown in the accompanying illustration It is a rubber mat to be placed under a typewriting machine for dead COMBINED WATERMOTOR AND DYNAMO waterwheel are shown detached from the wheelcase and stand or base The gearwheel and pinion seen in the wheelcase operate the devices which control the flow of water to the wheel thus gov erning the speed of the motor and dynamo Water under the req uisite pressure is admitted at the centre of the case in the rear passes through the curved arms shown in the case whence it im pinges upon the curved buckets of the wheel at the inside and escapes at the exterior of the wheel passing away through the base of the motor casing The wheel is an outvqrardflow turbine or vortex wheel mounted on the same shaft as the armature and may be run at a speed ranging from one thousand to three thou sand revolutions a minute according to the head of water avail able Several of these novel electriclight plants are now in opera tion and are said to give great satisfaction Aside from its use in connection with a dynamo this motor the Little Giant as it is caflcd is used for a variety of purposes having been on the market some eight or ten yearsW In many towns and cities of the United States and Canada where water at ening the clicking noise of the type which even in the best of typewriters sometimes becomes annoying The mat reduces the noise to a minimum and is made in various sizes and styles to fit machines of different makes Notes on Electric Railways using ThomsonHouston System The popularity of electric railways is evidenced by the recent purchase of the Des Moines Broad Gauge Railway equipped with the ThomsonHouston system by a wealthy Chicago syndicate the purchasing price being 350ooo some three times the original cost of the road When equipped with horses this road did not pay operating expenses but since its equipment and operation under the ThomsonHouston system its net earnings will pay 3 per cent dividends upon an investment of nearly 400000 The road has never had a repairshop for its electrical apparatus and in a recent conversation its president said that they did not know what electrical repairs meant as they had had none to make In some respects the Des Moines road has been the most wonderfulDAFT ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY Executive Offices 1 1 5 Broadway7 Nx Y  FACTORY JERSEY CITY N J Please Mention Science f r  GEARANTY INVESTMENT

as high as IO per cent without indications of overheating and frequently towcars are used with those equipped with motors On one branch of the system the necessity of speedy equipment compelled the use of a No 2 copper wire with out feeders such wire being the only available material yet with this small conductor the cars are run at a rate of S1X miles per hour up a Iopercent grade three miles distant from the station The Omaha and Council Bluffs Railway and Bridge Company are progressing rapidly with the electrical equipment of the re cently purchased horsecar lines in Council Bluffs For the opera tion of such lines they have purchased ten additional motortrucks and two generators from the ThomsonHouston Electric Company In placing this order for additional apparatus the management of the road state in a letter to the ThomsonHouston Company that they consider their present line equipped with the ThomsonHous ton system the most perfect electric railway in the world The Omaha Motor Railway Company is nearly ready to begin operations with the Thomson Houston electric system The largest powerstation which has yet beerf constructed for electric railway operation is owned by this company and the carequip ment ranks second in quantity among electric railways yet con structed it having twentysix motorcars each of which will be used to tow at least one additional car and many of the motorcars will tow two additional cars The success of the ThomsonHouston system on the Omaha and Council Bluffs line has made the citizens of Omaha jubilant at the immediate prospect of such rapid transit being given them over their entire city In addition to the equip ment ready to be put in the company intends to add twenty ad ditional motorcars upon the extensions to its system within a few

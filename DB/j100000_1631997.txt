j100000,Science,1631997,A New Method by Which Sponges May Be Artificially Reared,i295972,A NEW METHOD BY WHICH SPONGES MAY BE ARTIFICIALLY REARED I HAVE found in the course of an investiga tion carried on for the Bureau of Fisheries that silicious sponges when kept in conflne ment under proper conditions degenerate giv ing rise to small masses of undifferentiated tissue which in their turn are able to grow and differentiate into perfect sponges The investigation has been prosecuted during the past three summers at the Beaufort Labora tory While the degeneration with the forma tion of the indifferent masses has been ob Published with the permission of 13on Geo EL Bowers U S Commissioner of Fisheries served in several species it is only in one species a Stylotella that the process as a whole has been worked out This sponge which is exceedingly abundant in Beaufort Harbor is a fleshy monactinellid commonly reaching a thickness and height of 1012 cm Conical processes with terminal oscula project upwards from the lower body With this species which is a lightloving form I have obtained the best results when outside aquaria either concrete aquaria or tubs were used The method of treatment is briefly this Into a tub about 60 cm by 30 cm and covered with glass a half dozen sponges freed as far as possible from live oysters and crabs are put They are raised from the bottom on bricks The tub is emptied filled and flushed for some minutes three times in every twenty four hours Direct rays of the sun should be avoided Tubs answer as well as concrete aquaria and have the advantage of being movable In a day or two the oscula of the sponge disappear and the surface begins to acquire a peculiar smooth dense and uniform appear ance Microscopic study reveals the fact that not only the oscula but the pores also for the most part close and the canal system be comes interrupted and in some degree sup pressed The mesenchyme is more uniform and is denser than in the normal sponge ow ing in part at least to the disappearance of the extensive collenchymatous very watery mesenchyme tracts of the latter The whole sponge may pass into this state and remain without great change for weeks During this period it shrinks greatly in size in a given case to one quarter the original bulk The arrangement of the skeletal spic ules becomes much simplified With the shrinkage in size the sponge becomes more solid i e more of the canal space is sup pressed Some flagellated chambers persist and there are a few small scattered apertures on the surface The bulk of the chambers dis appear as such the collarcells transforming into simple polyhedral masses which become scattered singly or in groups in the general mesenchyme The mesenchyme is a syncy tium composed of wellmarked cells that areJuNz 7 1907 SCIENCE 913 freely interconnected The sponge in this condition closely resembles Spongilla in its winter phase as described by Weltner Pre sumably water continues to circulate through the body but the current must be an exceed ingly feeble and irregular one As a sponge in this condition continues to shrink it may subdivide and thus a large sponge may eventually be represented by numerous masses in a given case about 1 cm in diameter Now if the sponge in this con dition or if one of the masses into which it has split up be attached to wire gauze and suspended in a live box floating at the sur face of the open water of the harbor the sponge or piece will in a few days grow and redevelop the pores and oscula flagellated chambers tissue differentiation and skeletal arrangement of the normal sponge Whether in this regeneration the transformed and separated collar cells again unite to form the flagellated chambers I can not say I think it very doubtful In the two classes of cases just described the sponge as a whole degenerates and slowly shrinks Cellular death takes place so gradu ally that at no time is there any obvious corpse tissue or skeletal debris Much more common and of far greater interest are the following cases In these a large part of the sponge body dies in the course of two or three weeks leaving the skeletal network still in place and bearing the brown decaying rem nants of the flesh which as maceration con tinues are washed away In places however the sponge body does not die Here masses of living tissue are left conspicuous amidst the dead remains by their bright color and smooth clean surface These living frag ments may be classified into three groups First the upper end of an ascending lobe or a considerable part of the body of the lobe may be left alive in its entirety thus forming a more or less cylindrical mass up to 5 mm diameter with a length sometimes two or three times the thickness The histological condi tion of these masses is not very different from that of the sponges already described Such a mass may be said to consist of anastomosing trabeculsa separated by the remains of the canal system The mesenchyme composing the trabeculse consists of discrete cells inter connected by processes to form a syncytium The flagellated chambers as such have nearly disappeared although remnants may still be recognized In them the collar cells have transformed into simple polyhedral bodies that are widely separated The bulk of the cham bers have broken up into their constituent cells and these are now scattered as ele mentary parts of the general mesenchyme When such masses are attached to wire gauze and hung in a floating livebox they trans forminto perfect sponges A second class of surviving remnants in cludes masses scattered over the general sur face of the sponge These may be spheroidal and small less than one millimeter in di ameter Usually they are flattened and of an irregular shape with lobes suggesting a lobose rhizopod or myxomycete plasmodium Such masses which may be connected by slender strands are commonly from two to five milli meters in the longest direction The third class of remnants are found scattered through the body of the dead and macerated sponge in which they sometimes occupy positions that are obviously favorable for respiration These bodies are more or less spheroidal and small their diameter varying commonly from one half to one and a half millimeters In the most successful cases of treatment the small masses internal and superficial are exceed ingly abundant and the dead and macerated sponge body with its contained nodules of conspicuous living tissue strongly suggests a Spongilla full of gemmules These living remnants of the sponge bodies of the second and third classes execute slow ama3boid changes of shape and position be having thus like plasmodia and they may be designated as plasmodial masses Micro scopic examination shows them to be of an exceedingly simple character without canal spaces or flagellated chambers The mass does not consist of discrete cells but is an aggre gation of syncytial protoplasm studded with nuclei The protoplasm is stored with minute geschongillidenstudien IL Arehiv fir Natur geschichte 1893914 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 649 inclusions and is reticulate in arrangement The nuclei are practically all alike and there are no signs of persisting collarcells Such a mass represents a portion of the original sponge in which the degenerative changes have progressed farther than in the larger rem nants In the latter we find a syncytium made up of discrete cells among which some persisting collarcells are distinguishable But in the plasmodial mass the cells have united so intimately that cell outlines have been wiped out and recognizable collarcells or their nuclei have disappeared The optical evidence points to the conclusion that the lat ter help to form the general syncytium under going regressive changes in their differentia tion which result in their becoming indifferent parts of this unspecialized tissue The plasmodial masses remain alive in the laboratory indefinitely but do not transform They attach to the bottom of the vessel but so feebly as to be easily shaken loose In order to see if they would transform when returned to natural conditions I devised the simple plan of enclosing them in fine bolting cloth bags which were hung in a livebox float ing in the harbor The bags rectangular were divided into compartments about an inch square with the two fiat sides nearly touching In each such space an isolated plasmodial mass was inserted and the bag sewed up It was found that in such bags the masses were held in place long enough for them firmly to attach to the bolting cloth Once attached to the cloth they grow sometimes quite through the wall of the bag to the outer water and trans form into perfect sponges with osculum can als pores and flagellated chambers in such abundance as to be crowded This ability to undergowhen the environ ment is unfavorable but not excessively so regressive changes of differentiation resulting in the production of a simpler more uniform tissue is something that is plainly useful i e adaptive In the simplified state the sponge protoplasm withstands conditions fatal to such parts of the body as do not succeed in passing into this state and on the return of normal conditions again develops the characteristic structure and habits of the species That this power is exercised in nature there can scarcely be a doubt since the conditions that are pres ent in an aquarium must now and then occur in tidepools It is probable that the power thus to degen erate with production of masses of regenera tive tissue is general among sponges I first discovered the phenomenon in Microcionac a very different form from Stylotella and one in which the skeleton includes much horny mat ter And in two other Beaufort species I have succeeded in producing the plasmodial masses There is every reason for believing that the commercial sponge shares in this ability If this is so we have here a means of propagation which with a further develop ment of methods may at some time become economically practicable In any case it is now possible to study the differentiation of a quite unspecialized tissue one that is physi ologically embryonic into a perfect sponge at any time of the year irrespective of the breed ing season We may even exercise some direct control over the size of the plasmodial masses as the following experiment shows Microciona was kept in aquaria until the degenerative process had begun Pieces were then teased with needles in a watch glass of sea water in such a way as to liberate quanti ties of cells and small irregular cellagglomer ates These were gently forced with pipette to the center of the watch glass Fusion of cells and masses with aimeboid phenomena began at once and in half an hour quite large irregular masses existed In the course of a few hours the masses grew enormously through continued fusion From this time on they ad hered firmly to the glass retaining irregular plasmodiumlike shapes and the growth was inconspicuous To bring them together once more and induce further fusion they were on the following day forcibly freedwith pipette and needle and to clean them of cellular debris and bacteria were transferred to a tumbler covered with bolting cloth in which they were kept actively moving under a fine glass faucet for about thirty minutes In the course of this violent agitation a good many masses were lost Those remaining in the tumbler became in the next few hours noticeJUNE 7 1907 SCIENCE 915 ably rounder and smoother at the surface From this experiment eighteen more or less spheroidal masses were obtained some of which measured one half millimeter in di ameter They were similar to the small plas modial masses produced in this species and in Stylotella when the sponges are allowed to remain quietly in aquaria As already stated it is only in Stylotella that I have di rectly proved the regenerative power of these masses Maas has just announced3 that calcareous sponges Sycons when exposed to sea water deprived of its calcium undergo marked de generative changes which may be of such a character that the living tissue quite separates from the skeleton and breaks up into compact cords of cells showing active amceboid phe nomena The cords further constrict into rounded masses the likeness of which to gemn mules is pointed out Maas states that he is not yet in a position to say whether these masses have the power to transform into sponges but adds that some of his observa tions induce him to believe that this is pos sible It is evident that Maas working on very different forms has independently met with the same degenerativeregenerative phenomena as are described in this communication the essential facts of which were presented to gether with an exhibit of gemmulelike de generation masses and young sponges into which such masses had transformed at the recent December meeting of the American Society of Zoologists I may add that more than two years ago at the end of the summer of 1904 in my official report unpublished since the research was still in progress to the Bureau of Fisheries on the investigation under my charge I described the degenerative phenomena in Microciona and StyloteUlla i e the formation under certain conditions of confinement of minute masses presenting a likeness to gemmules and emphasized the probability that these masses were able to re generate the sponge It was not however until the summer of 1906 that I was able to demonstrate the truth of this view H V

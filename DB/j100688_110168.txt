J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,110168,ON CAPTAIN PARRYS AND LIEUTENANT FOSTERS EXPERIMENTS ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND ABSTRACT,I207044,CESSIVE ADDITION OF 10 PER CENT OF GOLD TO THE SILVER THE FUSION OF WHICH WHEN PURE MARKS THE POINT OF ZERO WHILE THAT OF GOLD IS RECKONED AT TEN DEGREES IF MINUTER SUBDIVISIONS WERE REQUIRED FOR PARTICULAR OBJECTS OF RESEARCH THESE MIGHT EASILY BE MADE FOLLOWING ALWAYS THE DECIMAL SERIES FROM THE POINT OF FUSION OF PURE GOLD TO THAT OF PURE PLATINA THE AUTHOR ASSUMES 100 DEGREES ADDING TO THE ALLOY WHICH IS TO MEASURE EACH IN SUCCESSION 1 PER CENT OF PLATINA WHETHER THESE HYPOTHETICAL DEGREES REPRESENT EQUABLE INCREMENTS OF TEMPERATURE IS A QUESTION FOREIGN TO THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER AND MUST BE THE SUBJECT OF FUTURE INVESTIGATION THE AUTHOR THEN ENTERS INTO A DETAILED ACCOUNT OF THE METHOD HE EMPLOYED FOR INSURING AC CURACY IN THE FORMATION OF THE REQUISITE SERIES OF ALLOYS AND OF VARIOUS EXPERIMENTS UNDERTAKEN TO ASCERTAIN THEIR FITNESS AS MEASURES OF HIGH TEMPERATURES THE DETERMINATIONS OF THE HEATS OF THE DIFFERENT FUR NACES ADAPTED TO PARTICULAR OBJECTS ARE GIVEN IN A TABULAR FORM THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE PAPER CONTAINS THE RECITAL OF THE AUTHORS ATTEMPTS TO DETERMINE BY MEANS OF AN APPARATUS CONNECTED WITH AN AIR THERMOMETER THE RELATION WHICH THE FUSING POINT OF PURE SILVER BEARS TO THE ORDINARY THERMOMETRIC SCALE AN EXTENSIVE SERIES OF EX PERIMENTS OF WHICH THE RESULTS ARE GIVEN IN A TABLE WERE MADE WITH THIS APPARATUS FROM THE DATA THUS AFFORDED AFTER MAKING THE NE CESSARY CORRECTIONS THE AUTHOR DEDUCES THE FOLLOWING RESULTS IN DEGREES OF FAHRENHEIT VIZ A FULL RED HEAT 1200 ORANGE HEAT 1650 MELT ING POINT OF SILVER WHICH HAD BEEN ESTIMATED BY WEDGEWOOD AT 4717 AND BY DANIELL AT 2233 1830 OF SILVER ALLOYED WITH ONE TENTH GOLD 1920 THE PAPER IS ACCOMPANIED WITH DRAWINGS OF THE APPARATUS EM PLOYED ON CAPTAIN PARRYS AND LIEUTENANT FOSTERS EXPERIMENTS ON THE VELO CITY OF SOUND BY DR GERARD MOLL PROFESSOR OF NATURAL PHILO SOPHY IN THE UNIVERSITY OF UTRECHT COMMUNICATED BY CAPTAIN HENRY KATER VPRS READ JANUARY 17 1828 PHIL TRANS 1828 P 97 IN THIS PAPER THE AUTHOR INSTITUTES A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE RE SULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND MADE BY CAPTAIN PARRY AND LIEUTENANT FOSTER IN THE ARCTIC REGIONS AND THOSE DEDUCED FROM THE THEORETICAL FORMULA OF LAPLACE AT THE TEMPERATURE OF 17072 OF FAHRENHEIT AND WITH A BAROMETRIC PRESSURE OF 29 936 INCHES THE MEAN RESULT OF ALL THE OBSERVATIONS GAVE A VELOCITY OF 103619 FEET PER SECOND WITH THE SAME DATA THIS VELOCITY BY CALCULATION ACCORDING TO THE FORMULA OF LAPLACE WOULD BE 1017 72 DIFFERING FROM THE OBSERVED VELOCITY BY 1747 FEET ONLY SIMILAR COMPARISONS OF PARTICULAR OBSERVATIONS WHICH ARE SELECTED AS BEING MADE UNDER FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THE DEDUCTIONS FROM THEORY ARE MADE BY THE AUTHOR WITH BUT LITTLE VARIATION IN THE RESULTS FROM THE WHOLE INVESTIGATION HE DRAWS THE CONCLUSION THAT IN VERY HIGH LATITUDES WHERE THE COLD IS VERY INTENSE THE DATA ON WHICH THE333 3 CALCULATIONS ARE FOUNDED ARE MORE UNCERTAIN THAN AT ORDINARY TEMPE RATURES THUS CONFIRMING THE OPINION OF LAPLACE WHO SAYS IN SPEAKING OF THESE DIFFERENCES  QUELLES PARAISSENT ETRE DANS LES LIMITES DES PETITES ERREURS DONT CETTE EXPERIENCE ET LES 6L6MENS DU CALCUL DONT JAI FAIT USAGE SONT ENCORE SUSCEPTIBLES THE AUTHOR SHOWS BY AN ELABORATE CALCULATION THAT THE INFLUENCE OF MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERE ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND MUST AT THESE TWO TEMPERATURES BE QUITE TRIFLING NOT AMOUNTING IN ANY CASE TO MORE THAN A FEW INCHES IN A SECOND AND THAT THIS ELEMENT MAY THEREFORE BE SAFELY NEGLECTED IN THE COMPUTATION HE NEXT PROCEEDS TO COMPARE THE EXPERIMENTS OF THE NORTHERN NAVIGATORS WITH THOSE OF DR VAN BECK AND HIMSELF AND ALSO THOSE OF OTHER OBSERVERS ADVERTING TO THEIR GENERAL AGREEMENT WHICH HE OBSERVES IS SUFFICIENTLY SATISFACTORY TO WARRANT THE CONCLU SION THAT WHATEVER DIFFERENCE MAY STILL BE FOUND TO EXIST BETWEEN COMPUTATION AND OBSERVATION IS RATHER TO BE ASCRIBED TO SOME IMPER FECTION IN THE THEORETICAL FORMULA THAN TO ANY FAULT OR NEGLIGENCE IN THE OBSERVERS HE CONCLUDES BY REMARKING THE STRONG TESTIMONY WHICH CAPTAIN PARRYS OBSERVATIONS AFFORD OF HIS EXEMPLARY ACCURACY AMIDST THE GREAT DIFFICULTIES WITH WHICH FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH HE WAS PLACED HE HAD GENERALLY TO CONTEND AN ACCOUNT OF A SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH A VIEW TO THE CON STRUCTION OF AN ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE WITH A FLUID CONCAVE LENS IN STEAD OF THE USUAL LENS OF FLINT GLASS IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO DA VIES GILBERT ESQ MP PRESIDENT OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BY PETER BARLOW ESQ FRS 8C READ JANUARY 17 1828 PHIL TRANS 1828 P 105 THE IDEA OF CONSTRUCTING ACHROMATIC TELESCOPES WITH FLUID LENSES WAS FIRST SUGGESTED TO THE AUTHOR BY THE ATTEMPT OF MESSRS GILBERT TO APPLY TO PRACTICE THE PRINCIPLES AND RULES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF APLANATIC OBJECTGLASSES LAID DOWN BY MR HERSCHEL IN THE PHILOSO PHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1821 IN FOLLOWING THESE SUGGESTIONS THE AUTHOR BECAME SENSIBLE OF THE DIFFICULTY OF OBTAINING FLINT GLASS OF SUFFICIENT SIZE AND PURITY FOR ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPES AND WAS THENCE LED TO CONSIDER THE POSSIBILITY OF SUBSTITUTING SOME FLUID IN PLACE OF FLINT GLASS DR BLAIR HAD MANY YEARS AGO SUCCEEDED IN MAKING VERY PERFECT TELESCOPES OF THIS DESCRIPTION BUT HE STILL RETAINED THE USE OF FLINT GLASS AMONG THE VARIOUS FLUIDS ADAPTED TO THIS OPTICAL PURPOSE THE AUTHOR GAVE A DECIDED PREFERENCE TO THE SULPHURET OF CARBON WHICH COMBINES PROPERTIES OF PERFECT TRANSPARENCY AND FREEDOM FROM COLOUR WITH A REFRACTIVE INDEX NEARLY EQUAL TO THAT OF FLINT GLASS AND WITH A DISPERSIVE POWER MORE THAN DOUBLE PROPERTIES WHICH IT APPEARS TO RETAIN UNDER ALL THE TEMPERATURES TO WHICH IT IS LIKELY TO BE EX POSED IN AN ASTRONOMICAL TELESCOPE AFTER SEVERAL TRIALS MR BARLOW DETERMINED THE BEST METHOD OF CONFINING THIS FLUID BUT WAS AT FIRST UNSUCCESSFUL IN HIS ATTEMPTS TO CONSTRUCT WITH IT A TELESCOPE OF 6 INCHES APERTURE AND 7 FEET IN LENGTH HE AFTERWARDS UNDERTOOK A SMALLER ONE OF 3 INCHES APERTURE WHICH HE AT LENGTH ACCOMPLISHED AND IN THE VERY FIRST TRIALS WITH IT WAS ABLE TO SEPARATE A GREAT NUM

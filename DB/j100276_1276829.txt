j100276,Michigan Law Review,1276829,Statute of Frauds Inapplicable to Maritime Contracts,i254526,NOTE AND COMMENT STATUTE OF FRAUDS INAPPICABI TO MARITIME CONTRACTSThe recent decision of the Supreme Court in Union Fish Company v Erickson Adv Opinions February I I919 143 may occasion surprise although it is only the logical outcome of the principle announced in Workman v New York 179 U S 552 and Southern Pacific v Jensen 244 U S 205 The Fish Com pany a California corporation had engaged Erickson to serve as master of one of its vessels in Alaska waters for a term of not less than one year commencing at a future date The contract was made in San Francisco and was wholly in parol It was to be performed in Alaska and on the high seas After a months service the master was wrongfully discharged and then brought suit in admiralty for the damages sustained by the breach of contract The shipowner contended that the contract was invalid under the statute of frauds of California as well as of Alaska being a parol agree ment which could not be performed within one year The Supreme Court decides that the contract by reason of its being maritime in its nature is not within the statute and sustains a decree in favor of the master the uni formity of the maritime law must not be impaired by local statutes and the validity of maritime contracts must be determined by that law alone The ordinary rule by which the validity of a contract is tested including the application of the statute of frauds is that of the lex loci contractus STORY ON CONFLICT OF LAWS 262 This of course may yield to the lex loci solutionis if the intention of the parties requires Jacobs v CreditLyonnais 12 Q B D 589 and in maritime transactions both may be displaced in favor of the law of the ships flag CARVER ON CARRIAGE BY SEA  204 In the Erickson case however the contract would have been invalid under either of these three rules It was plainly within the statute of California if the place where it was made determined the rule Seymour v Oelrichs I56 Cal 782 it was likewise within the statute of Alaska if the place of performance were resorted to WOOD ON FRAUDS 490 and the law of the ships flag would still leave it subject to the laws of California since the ship was owned by a California corporation and continued to be a part of that state and subject to its laws even while on the high seas Crapo v Kelly i6 Wall 6o1 The Hamilton 207 U S 398 The decision therefore presents a new and pre dominating rule for testing the validity of maritime contracts namely the maritime law Local statutes may not be invoked it would seem to follow either to impair or to protect maritime contracts because their validity must be tested by the maritime law alone The case may have far reaching effects and necessitate legislation on the subject of maritime contracts The mari time law by itself is quite meager on the subject of the formation of con tract It has no settled doctrines of its own in this respect but has usually followed local law If a contract existed according to the local law and was maritime in its nature the admiralty had jurisdiction Whether or not a contract existed was determined by the doctrines of the local law In countries following English doctrines for example the admiralty would not recognize an agreement void for want of consideration or mutuality not be cause the admiralty has any rules of its own in regard to consideration or mutuality but because there was no contract by local law where these ele 59IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ments were lacking Dennis v Slyfield 117 Fed 474 On the other hand in countries where the English doctrine does not prevail the absence of con sideration would not prevent the admiralty enforcing an agreement otherwise within its jurisdiction In other words the admiralty has not yet evolved any law of contracts of its own except in regard to the secondary matter of testing their maritime nature It has left this matter of formation of con tract the essentials of its validity and the requisite evidentiary conditions to local law common or statutory Doubtless every local law however tends to impair uniformity This can only be avoided by a general code of maritime law Until it is promulgated uniformity will be impossible The logical effect of the decision in the Erickson case will be to emphasize the necessity for a complete revision and codification of our maritime law Its develop ment has been so interwoven with local law that a somewhat chaotic situa tion may develop if the effect of this decision is correctly estimated to be a divorcement from the local law in respect of contracts before anything has been prepared to take its place The principle of the decision would it seems have been equally fatal to the statute of frauds if the action had been at law in a state court A writ of error from the Supreme Court of the United States could have been in voked to review its judgment and the same result would have followed as is accomplished by the decision in the proceeding in admiralty GEORGE L CANFIELD SHOULD A CORRECT VERDICT BE SET ASIDE BECAUSE THE JURY FAILED TO FOLLOW ERRONEOUS INSTRUCTIONSOne of the common grounds of a new trial is that the verdict is contrary to law What law is meantthe law as it really is or the law that was given to the jury by the courts instruction Most cases hold to the latter view It is the duty of the jury to take the law from the court whether the court in so giving it is right or wrong Hence the jury violate their duty if they fail to follow instructions even if the in structions are wrong and a verdict based on a breach of the jurys duty can not be allowed to stand even though intrinsically correct Talley v Whit lock Ala I917 73 So 976 Gartner v Mohan 39 S D 202 Yellow Poplar Lumber Co v Bartley 164 Ky 763 Soderburg v Chicago St P M  O Ry Co 167 Ia 123 Freel v Pietzsch 22 N D 113 Barton v Shull 62 Neb 570 Dent v Bryce 16 S C 14 Murray v Heinze 17 Mont 353 The argument on which this rule is founded is well expressed by the Supreme Court of Montana in Murray v Heinze supra where the court said But counsel for the appellant contend that the instruction being erroneous the court erred in setting aside the verdict because of the fact that the jury wholly disregarded it  This is the first time it has been seriously con tended in this court that the jury have the right to determine the law in an ordinary suit at law and to absolutely disregard the instructions of the court on the ground that in the opinion of the jury the instructions of the court are erroneous If the contention of the appellant is to be upheld what may we not anticipate as the result in the administration of the law in this state If the jury may rightfully invade the province of the court why may not 592

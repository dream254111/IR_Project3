Water by Charles Perry M D made on his Journey through the Holy Land c E X P E R I M E N T S by way of Analysis upon the Water of Asphaltis commonly called the Dead Sea E X P E R I M E N T I U P O N steeping or infusing some Scrapings of Gall in it after stand ing a long time it turnd of a bright purple Colour Read Feb 25 17412 E X P E R I M E N T II Upon the Instillation of Ol Tartari per Deliq it immediately became troubled or muddy and seemd as if Goblets of Fat were fluctuating in it This unctuous Matter upon long standing in Repose came49 came gradually into closer Contact and at last sub sided E X P E R I M E N T III Upon the Instillation of Spirit of Vitriol it de posited a Milkwhite greasy Sediment which after 12 Hours Repose occupied onefifth Part of the Ve hicle or Liquor E X P E R I M E N T IV Being mixd with a Solution of Saccharum Saturni it let fall a small Quantity of a greyish Powder E X P E R I M E N T V Being severally and separately mixd with Solution of Sublimate with Sp Sal Armoniac and with Sugar of Violets it neither fermented deposited any Sedi ment grew turbid nor changed Colour except only from the Sugar of Violets which turnd it of a dark Green O B S E R V A T I O N S This Water is highly saturated with Salt insomuch that any Measure of it preponderates fresh Water under equal Surfaces in the Ratio of Five to Four It has also a wonderful Acrity insomuch that being held in the Mouth for a short time it con stringes it in like manner as Alum does I cannot from the above Experiments and the Appearances which resulted from them conclude that this Water is impregnated with any thing more than mere Salt which is of a very acrid alkaline Na ture and something else which may be of a com pound Nature partly sulphureous and partly bitumi G nous50 nous But to speak negatively it may be presumd I think that it neither partakes of Steel Alum nor Vitriol nor yet of a pure genuine Sulphur And consequently as I take it can afford no other nor better Effects to such as may bathe in it than other Seawater except only that its greater Degree of Salt and superior Weight may somewhat heighten the same Effects E X P E R I M E N T S by way of Analysis upon the hot Spring Water near Tiberiades E X P E R I M E N T I Oil of Tartar per Deliq 3ss being mixd with  iss of the Water it became troubled and muddy and after standing 12 Hours in Repose Threequar ters of the Whole from the Bottom upwards ap peard like white Wooll But this woolly Water be ing separated by Filtration and left to dry seemd no other than a yellowish Oker E X P E R I M E N T II I mixd 3 ss Sp Vitriol with  iss of the Water and after 12 Hours standing still I found a large Sediment of a white unctuous Matter E X P E R I M E N T III Solution of Sublimate 3ss being mixd with  iss of the Water it became turbid and yellowish and yielded an earthy Sediment in small Quantity whence I conclude it contains a Sal murale E X51 E X P E R I M E N T IV One Ounce and half of the Water mixd with 3ss of a Solution of Sacch Saturni deposited a greyish Sediment of a lateritious Matter in small Quantity E X P E R I M E N T V One Ounce and half of the Water mixd with 3ss Sp Sal Armoniac turnd turbid of a Colour betwixt Green andBlue and after 12 Hours Repose yielded a woolly Sediment of four Digits deep E X P E R I M E N T VI One Ounce and half of the Water mixd with 3ss Sacch Violar became troubled and of a darkyel lowish Colour E X P E R I M E N T VII One Ounce and half mixd with 3ss of Scrapings of Gall became of a fine violet Colour but when shook was as deep as Ink O B S E R V A T I O N S This Water as appears to my Judgment con tains a good deal of a gross fixd Vitriol some Alum and a mural Salt of a limy Quality Tis too salt and nauseous for internal Use but by batheing in it must be good for all cutaneous Distempers and especially for the Scurvy and Le prosy For it will powerfully deterge scour and clean the excretory Pores and it may by its Weight and Stimulus restore them to their natural State Strength and Elasticity It may by the same G 2 Means52 Means restore the lost or impaird Tone of the Solids in general In Consequence of which it may thin the Blood help its Circulation and promote the natural Digestions and Secretions and thus finally it may be useful in Rheumatisms Dropsies Jaundices and nephritic Diseases Analysis of the Hammam Pharoan Water near Corromondel on the way to Mount Sinai E X P E R I M E N T I This Water being mixd with the Scrapings of Gall manifested no sensible Change at first but after long standing it grew somewhat greenish E X P E R I M E N T II Upon the Instillation of Sp Sal Armoniac it became turbid and on standing some time in Re pose deposited a darkgreyish Powder in small Quantity E X P E R I M E N T III Four Ounces of the Water being mixd with 3iss Sacc Violar manifested no Change except what would necessarily result from the Tincture of Violets E X P E R I M E N T IV Being mixd with a Solution of Sacch Saturni it became immediately very turbid but on standing some time in Repose it deposited a large dark brown Sediment leaving the Vehicle troubled and whitish E X53 E X P E R I M E N T V I mixd a Solution of Sublimate with it upon which it became immediately yellow but after standing at Rest it deposited a woolly unctuous Matter in small Quantity E X P E R I M E N T VI Being mixd with Ol Tartari per Deliq it be came of a chyly Colour and Substance or of a turbid pearly Colour E X P E R I M E N T VII Being mixd with Spirit of Vitriol it manifested no Change either of Colour or Transparency O B S E R V A T I O N I conclude from the Phaenomena which appeard upon Analysation that this Water is impregnated with a good deal of a gross earthy Sulphur a neutral Salt a small Quantity of Alum but no Proportionof Vitriol This cannot be used inwardly it being nauseous beyond Expression It smells somewhat like rotten Eggs but much worse But used by way of Bath it may cleanse the Skin of all Foulnesses purge and deterge the cutaneous Glands from all foul noxious Humours It may reinforce the natural Heat and Vigour where they are decayed and may restore the impaird Digestions And hence finally it may promote Virility in Men and Fecundity in Wo men It may likewise be useful in the Gout as also in Epilepsies and other Diseases of the ner vous Class XV An

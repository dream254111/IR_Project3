States Bureau of Education hopes to have five million boys and girls in every city town and village cap tained by forty thousand teachers produce as nearly as possible all of the vegetables small fruits and eggs for their home consumption Are the captains in your school appointed  Have the volunteers for the ranks enrolled  President Wilson supporting the movement writes to Secretary Lane MY DEAR MR SECRETARY February 25 1918 I sincerely hope that you may be successful through the Bureau of Educa tion in arousing the interest of teachers and children in the schools of the United States in the cultivation of home gardens Every boy and girl who really sees what the home garden may mean will I am sure enter into the purpose with high spirits because I am sure they would all like to feel that they are in fact fighting in France by joining the homegarden army They know that America has undertaken to send meat and flour and wheat and other foods for the sup port of the soldiers who are doing the fighting for the men and women who are making the munitions and for the boys and girls of Western Europe and that we must also feed ourselves while we are carrying on this war The move ment to establish gardens therefore and to have the children work in them is just as real and patriotic an effort as the building of ships or the firing of cannon I hope that this spring every school will have a regiment in the Volunteer War Garden Army Cordially and sincerely yours Signed WOODRow WILSON HEALTH PROBLEMS Dr Thomas D Wood of Columbia University chairman of the NEA Committee on Health Problems reporting at Atlantic City the results of a nationwide investigation said Our schools are wasting enormous sums in educating or trying to educate children who are handicapped by ill health At least i per cent two hundred thousand of the 22000000 school children in the United States are mentally defective 286EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 287 Over I per cent two hundred and fifty thousand at least of the children are handicapped by organic heart disease At least 5 per cent a million children have now or have had tuberculosis a danger often to others as well as to themselves Five per cent a million of them have defective hearing which unrecog nized gives many the undeserved reputation of being mentally defective Twentyfive per cent five million of these school children have defective eyes All but a small percentage of these can be corrected and yet a majority of them have received no attention Fifteen to twentyfive per cent three to five million of them are suffering from malnutrition and poverty is not the most important cause of this serious barrier to healthy development From 15 to 25 per cent three to five million have adenoids diseased tonsils or other glandular defects From o10 to 20 per cent two to four million have weak foot arches weak spines or other joint defects From 50 to 75 per cent eleven to sixteen million of our school children have defective teeth and all defective teeth are more or less injurious to health Some of these defective teeth are deadly menaces to their owners Seventyfive per cent sixteen million of the school children of the United States have physical defects which are potentially or actually detrimental to health Most of these defects are remediable USEFUL WAR BULLETIN FOR ENGLISH CLASSES Under the

Chapel Hill North Carolina Expense is extremely moderate THE DISTRICT SYSTEM IN NEW YORK Last year New York abolished the time immemorial district system and substituted the township unit of school control The pur pose was to give a larger unit of support and of administration to secure an equality of financial burden over wider areas and to promote educa tional opportunity within that area At present there is a vigorous effort instituted on behalf of reluctant taxpayers who are feeling the288 THE SCHOOL REVIEW pressure to repeal the new law Opposition to the repeal is being led by Dr Finley and Dr Finegan the latter of whom points out There are 15 schools in the state now in each of which there is just i pupil there are 86 in which there are 2 i16 with 3 pupils 357 in which there are but 5 pupils 6oo in which there are less than 7 and 3800 in which there are less than io children in attendance Everybody knows that it is absolutely impossible to maintain in one of these districts a school which comes anywhere near approaching an institution worthy of the name school Dr Finegan is further reported to have said There has been a great change in this state in the last forty years Thirty five or forty years ago there were more people living in the agricultural regions There are one hundred thousand less children in attendance upon the schools maintained in agricultural regions than there were thirtyfive years ago If the farmers of the state are to avail themselves of the great opportunity to serve the country by increasing production rural life must be made more comfortable and attractive The schools are the great agencies which must achieve this result  CONTINUOUS COLLEGES  From Pennsylvania and Dartmouth comes word that these univer sities are inaugurating the plan of continuous sessions Of course the yearround college is as yet in its incipiency in these two institutions however both have admitted Freshmen at midyears The Boston Transcript points out that concessions of this nature are demanded by the times  With all our young men at the threshold of national service and with the task of getting an education in the brief time allotted having become much more difficult any and all steps that make the task more possible must be commended no matter how much red tape of academic tradition they may tear down The Transcript predicts that alumni opposition to the foursession plan will vanish Thus gradually are colleges like Dartmouth and publicopinionmaking agencies like the Transcript coming to realize the value of all means making for economy of time for dignity of effort in education At any rate the long summer vacation originally necessary to allow boys to work on the farms has today degenerated into an undignified loafing period for many college students PLAIN FOOLISHNESS Fortunately the spectacle is unusual of schools and school men lead ing their pupils into spectacular but silly war activities Fortunately we have hundreds yes thousands of courses for women instituted inEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 289 colleges and high schools courses in conservation of fuel and of food office management chemistry for nurses surgical dressing first aid and the like Perhaps it is only to make us realize how sensibly in general we are trying to fit our young women for war services that they might conceivably be called upon to perform perhaps it is for the purpose of furnishing us a suitable contrast that certain schools in Chicago are preparing to teach girls the manual of the rifle The officer in charge of the cadet corps ought to know better than to make the ridiculous statement attributed to him I know they the instructors will teach all school girls so thoroughly that if they were needed America could have its Battalion of Death Plain and unadulterated foolishness and waste LAX MILITARY TRAINING FOR BOYS Possibly Chicago officials have been led to form battalions of death because the attendance of boys who enrolled in military courses last spring has dwindled as woefully as it has in New York Last year from three hundred to four hundred boys in each of many high schools in that city began military drill today a scant thirty or forty comprise the various squads The rapid decrease is laid to the failure of school authorities and of the law to prescribe any penalty for nonattendance The record of Chicago boys is not so unfortunate but observation of the size of some of the squads points in that direction This Journal has repeatedly pointed out the absurdity of attempting anything like military drill which is not built solidly around the central virtue of military life discipline Indeed the very failure of military drill if it is a failure points directly to what was and is the chief argument in its favor namely teaching American youth to persevere in tasks after the newness and the spectacular has worn off UNIFORM HIGHSCHOOL ADMINISTRATION Mr J G Masters principal of Central High School Omaha was chairman of a committee which reported at the Department of Superin tendence a tentative plan for uniform highschool administration The committee was appointed by the National Association of Secondary School Principals Mr Masters writes It is only fair to say that I should take almost full responsibility for the report   no two of the principals with whom I talked would ever suggest the same item as a matter subject to uniformity290 THE SCHOOL REVIEW The Committee begs leave to report and to recommend i That a uniform record blank for the certification of grades be used by all high schools 2 That we recommend to all high schools a uniform system of marks as follows A 93 per cent to Ioo per cent B 86 per cent to 92 per cent C 78 per cent to 85 per cent D 70 per cent to 77 per cent E failure 3 That credit values be assigned and granted to the foregoing marks as follows A gives I2 credits B gives i i credits C gives i o credit D gives 08 credit E gives no credit or A gives I i credits B gives Io credit C gives o9 credit D gives no credit 4 That a credit or point be defined as onehalf of a unit That a unit represents a years study in any subject in a secondary school consisting of a quarter of a full years work which year shall be not less than the equivalent of 130 sixtyminute hours of classroom work Two hours of manual training mechanical drawing and laboratory work shall be considered the equivalent of one hour of classroom work Not more than onehalf of a unit shall be allowed upon a years work each in music art gymnasium military drill penmanship typewriting and other drill subjects 5 That not fewer than thirtytwo credits or sixteen units be accepted for graduation 6 That at least six units must be taken in each of the four years of the highschool course 7 That a student must make not fewer than seven credits in a high school to be graduated from that high school 8 That students must have made a passing grade in at least three full subjects the preceding semester and must be passing in the work enrolled in at the time to be eligible to class offices athletic events school offices offices in military places on the school paper and offices in other school activities g That in order to encourage scholarship in the high schools of the country an honor society be formed and that the basis of such society shall be high scholarship coupled with either leadership in the schools activities or a manifestation of unusual originality and constructive ability We suggest that about 5 or io per cent each of the boys and the girls be elected to this society from the senior class io In the selection of new teachers we recommend that preference be given those who have had recent training in the field of education i1 We recommend a number of debate clubs literary societies dramatic clubs department clubs athletic organizations etc under the careful guidance of school sponsors We decry secret societies as being unAmerican and undemocratic 12 We commend the application of the principles of scientific management to the solution of highschool problems to be carried out by statistical and experimental studies 13 We commend the sixandsix plan of highschool organization 14 We recommend the junior college of two years as an excellent plan of extending the opportunity of college work to

North eastern High School Detroit for the following description of the system by which pupils are grouped together in cooperating organizations called houses Mr McConnel is himself a house principal The average sized high school has six houses each containing from two hundred to two hundred and seventyfive pupils The boys and the girls are in separate houses In each house are pupils from all the grades in the high school thus in the sixyear high schools the new seventhgrade pupil finds himself in a house of two hundred pupils ranging from twelveyearold seventhgraders to eighteenyearold twelfthgraders The pupil remains a member of this house during his entire highschool life Buildings are constructed on the house system plan The average building has six large rooms planned to serve as houses The largest of these rooms in the Detroit schools have three thousand square feet of floor space providing easily for three hundred single seats and desks Each house has its house principal In general there are women as house principals for the girls and men for the boys The tenure of the house prin cipal is relatively permanent The position has been definitely created by the board of education and a special salary schedule provided Ordinarily the house principal does no teaching he may teach one class if the number of pupils in his house is below the average He is a sort of subprincipal for his group Attendance discipline and reports he must look after There are conferences every day with teachers parents pupils letters must be written visits to homes made truancy reports sent in The house principal should make it his business to know what each pupil of his house is doing in school and out of school Life in the school centers about the houses There are interhouse athletic contests Liberty Loan drives or ThriftStamp selling campaigns are made by houses house parties are held Each house has various organizations athletic social and literary Occasionally the pupils of the Webster House may be invited to a party in the House of Jane Addams The advantages of such a system are obvious During his entire high school career the pupil has the same house principal whose business it is to learn about his pupilstheir home life their special abilities their weaknesses their ambitions He advises them restrains them encourages them The system may be objected to as expensive It is expensive the expense is first felt in constructing the building and afterward felt in operating it Six house principalshigher salaried than teachers and doing no teaching doubtless add to the per capita cost of instruction But surely the result ought to justify this extra cost In individual cases however it is to be feared that the results do not justify the extra cost The activities of the house principalEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 293 are too largely intramural attendance discipline and reports are his chief concerns This should be charged up to the inefficient house principal how ever and not to the house system MILITARY FAILURES FOOD FOR TEACHERS THOUGHT The following is an extract from a statement of Inspector Blayney of Camp Funston giving reasons why many candidates failed to secure commissions It should be possible for highschool teachers to improve some of these specific difficulties referred to with great advantage to the pupils and to the general tone of school work Perhaps the most glaring fault noted in aspirants to the Officers Reserve Corps and the one which might be corrected by proper attention in our high schools preparatory schools and colleges might be characterized by the general word slouchiness I refer to what might be termed a mental and physical indifference I have observed at Camp Funston many otherwise excellent men who have failed because in our school system sufficient emphasis is not placed upon the avoidance of this physical and mental handicap At Camp Funston and other military camps mental alertness accuracy in thinking and acting clearness in enunciation sureness and ease of carriage and bearing must be insisted upon for two reasons that success may be assured as nearly as human effort can guarantee it with the material and means at hand and that priceless human lives may not be criminally sacrificed Only by the possession of the qualities referred to does one become a natural leader At Camp Funston we must train leaders A great number of men have failed at Camp Funston because of inability to articulate clearly A man who cannot impart his ideas to his command in clear distinct language and with sufficient volume of voice to be heard reason ably far is not qualified to give commands upon which human life will depend Many men disqualified by this handicap might have become officers under their countrys flag had they been properly trained in school and college It is to be hoped therefore that more emphasis will be placed upon the basic principles of elocution in the training of our youth Even without prescribed training in elocution a great improvement could be wrought by the instructors in our schools and colleges regardless of the subject insisting that all answers be given in a loud clear wellrounded voice which of course necessitates the opening of the mouth and the free movement of the lips It is remarkable how many excellent men suffer from this handicap and how difficult and almost impossible it is to correct this after the formative years of life In addition to this physical disability and slouchiness is what might be termed the slouchiness of mental attitude Many men fail to measure up to the requirements set for our Officers Reserve because they have not been trained to appreciate the importance of accuracy in thinking Too many294 THE SCHOOL REVIEW schools are satisfied with an approximate answer to a question Little or no incentive is given to increased mental effort to coordinate ones ideas and present them clearly and unequivocally Insistence upon decision in thought and expression must never be lost sight of It is next to impossible for military instructors to do much to counteract the negligence of schools in this regard This again has cost many men their commissions at Camp Funston As a last important element that seems to me has been lacking in the moral and mental makeup of some of our students there is the characteristic of grit Not that they would have proved cowardly in battle necessarily but some have exhibited a tendency to throw up the sponge upon the administration of a severe rebuke or criticism Their feelings have been hurt and they resign They have never been taught the true spirit of subordination They are not ready for the rough edges of life The true training schools should endeavor to inculcate that indomitable spirit that enables one to get out of self to keep ones eyes fixed upon the goal rather than upon the roughness of the path to realize that one unable to rise above the first hard knocks of discipline cannot hope to face with equanimity the tremendous responsibilities of the officer under modern conditions of warfare This idea of grit belongs in the schoolroom as well as upon the campus A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A determined effort is on foot to secure the passage of a law now before Congress establishing a federal department of education At the request of the chairman of the Senate Committee on Education the Association of College Presidents submitted a statement setting forth the need Since education is universally recognized as the first corollary of democracy it seems incongruous that it should not be recognized as of equal rank in the councils of the nation with that accorded Commerce Labor and Agriculture all of which have representatives in the Presidents cabinet The burden of the committees statement as elaborated by Presidents Judson McCracken and Campbell is that the educational agencies of the nation both during the war and after the war will have unprece dented opportunities and responsibilities in safeguarding democratic institutions Under the new conditions which the war has produced the supreme impor tance of education to the country stands out more clearly than ever before The great ideals which have always been in the minds of the people more or less in solution become the welldefined directing motives in the national con sciousness In the absence of a state religion the educational organization of the country must be the means of placing emphasis on the great moral andEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 295 spiritual values which are ultimately the determining factors in a nations history By the enlightenment which it spreads and the emphasis which it places on the great moral laws it can prove a large measure of salvation in a shifting social and economic order which we are inevitably facing at the close of the war What use will be made of the new measure of leisure which seems to be coming to the workman and what application he will make of the enlarged power which is already his will largely be determined by the place which is accorded education in the national life The enlargement of the suffrage also brings weighty additional responsibilities to the schools The nations ideals consciously expressed in the lives of its people deter mine its destiny As Humboldt has said What we desire in the government we must first put into the minds of the people through the schools This agitation of the colleges was heartily supported by the great majority of the school men recently gathered in Atlantic City and by a score of other associations embracing practically all of the more promi nent educational organizations of the country All see the imperative need of a great coordinating educational agency in Washington The Emergency Council on Education President J W Crabtree chairman sets forth the following types of educational problems arising out of war conditions I The group of problems relating to the immediately increased efficiency of the schools toward winning the war i Coordination of work of schools and of various independent organiza tions and agencies 2 Increased scientific research for war purposes 3 Training of students for all types of war service 4 Extension of educational work in military encampments 5 Educational propagandalectures pamphlets etcto make clear purposes of the war and maintain morale of people II The group of problems relating to the maintenance of the schools and schooling in all grades and stages as essential to the national defense i Furlough of students making special preparation for war service 2 Rearrangement of schedules to provide for temporary release of students for industrial purposes 3 Special equipment of schools for war training 4 Broadly organized utilization of schools by governmental departments for purposes of special training 5 Reeducation of the maimed III The group of problems relating to international educational relations i International educational commissions 2 Exchanges of faculty296 THE SCHOOL REVIEW 3 International scholarships 4 Courses of study and degrees IV The group of problems relating to the educational system after the war i Recasting of courses of study in light of lessons of the war 2 Shortening period of education 3 Appropriations and expenses of maintenance 4 Relationship of schools to federal government 5 Collection and preservation of war data Other problems of the future not mentioned in the list above are i Increased federal appropriations for vocational education together with the necessity of adjusting the new type of schools in harmony with the older type of institutions 2 The problem of making English truly our national tongue There are sections of the United States in which the majority of children are instructed in a foreign tongue receiving instruction in English if any at all but very incidentally Certainly this represents a condition inimical to our national spirit a condition imperatively demanding federal authority 3 The standardization of higher degrees professional and academic is beyond the scope of state action 4 The standardization of qualifications for teachers and national plans for the certification and employment At present distribution and employment of teachers are rendered difficult in the extreme by con flicting requirements of the various states Two major objections appear to be urged against the federal depart ment The first is the familiar argument of states rights and local con trol The reply is that education needs equalizing and standardizing In this field need is certainly as great as it was in the case of weights and measures certainly as great as it is in the case of marriage and divorce Separate state action is bound to result in a hodgepodge The second objection is perhaps somewhat more valid viz that the present is not opportune for pressing the question because almost all of the federal war services have already undertaken independent educational activities and therefore an attempt to nationalize them would result in difficulty and confusion To this the reply is again the imperative need of coordination and supervision of all in order that each endeavor may be managed in the light of the total good to be accomplished England Germany France have national departments of education Why should education in the greatest democracy of them all be left stranded in one subbureau of the Department of the Interior

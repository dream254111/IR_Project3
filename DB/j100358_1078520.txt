NORTH EASTERN HIGH SCHOOL DETROIT FOR THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM BY WHICH PUPILS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN COOPERATING ORGANIZATIONS CALLED HOUSES MR MCCONNEL IS HIMSELF A HOUSE PRINCIPAL THE AVERAGE SIZED HIGH SCHOOL HAS SIX HOUSES EACH CONTAINING FROM TWO HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE PUPILS THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS ARE IN SEPARATE HOUSES IN EACH HOUSE ARE PUPILS FROM ALL THE GRADES IN THE HIGH SCHOOL THUS IN THE SIXYEAR HIGH SCHOOLS THE NEW SEVENTHGRADE PUPIL FINDS HIMSELF IN A HOUSE OF TWO HUNDRED PUPILS RANGING FROM TWELVEYEAROLD SEVENTHGRADERS TO EIGHTEENYEAROLD TWELFTHGRADERS THE PUPIL REMAINS A MEMBER OF THIS HOUSE DURING HIS ENTIRE HIGHSCHOOL LIFE BUILDINGS ARE CONSTRUCTED ON THE HOUSE SYSTEM PLAN THE AVERAGE BUILDING HAS SIX LARGE ROOMS PLANNED TO SERVE AS HOUSES THE LARGEST OF THESE ROOMS IN THE DETROIT SCHOOLS HAVE THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OF FLOOR SPACE PROVIDING EASILY FOR THREE HUNDRED SINGLE SEATS AND DESKS EACH HOUSE HAS ITS HOUSE PRINCIPAL IN GENERAL THERE ARE WOMEN AS HOUSE PRINCIPALS FOR THE GIRLS AND MEN FOR THE BOYS THE TENURE OF THE HOUSE PRIN CIPAL IS RELATIVELY PERMANENT THE POSITION HAS BEEN DEFINITELY CREATED BY THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND A SPECIAL SALARY SCHEDULE PROVIDED ORDINARILY THE HOUSE PRINCIPAL DOES NO TEACHING HE MAY TEACH ONE CLASS IF THE NUMBER OF PUPILS IN HIS HOUSE IS BELOW THE AVERAGE HE IS A SORT OF SUBPRINCIPAL FOR HIS GROUP ATTENDANCE DISCIPLINE AND REPORTS HE MUST LOOK AFTER THERE ARE CONFERENCES EVERY DAY WITH TEACHERS PARENTS PUPILS LETTERS MUST BE WRITTEN VISITS TO HOMES MADE TRUANCY REPORTS SENT IN THE HOUSE PRINCIPAL SHOULD MAKE IT HIS BUSINESS TO KNOW WHAT EACH PUPIL OF HIS HOUSE IS DOING IN SCHOOL AND OUT OF SCHOOL LIFE IN THE SCHOOL CENTERS ABOUT THE HOUSES THERE ARE INTERHOUSE ATHLETIC CONTESTS LIBERTY LOAN DRIVES OR THRIFTSTAMP SELLING CAMPAIGNS ARE MADE BY HOUSES HOUSE PARTIES ARE HELD EACH HOUSE HAS VARIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ATHLETIC SOCIAL AND LITERARY OCCASIONALLY THE PUPILS OF THE WEBSTER HOUSE MAY BE INVITED TO A PARTY IN THE HOUSE OF JANE ADDAMS THE ADVANTAGES OF SUCH A SYSTEM ARE OBVIOUS DURING HIS ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL CAREER THE PUPIL HAS THE SAME HOUSE PRINCIPAL WHOSE BUSINESS IT IS TO LEARN ABOUT HIS PUPILSTHEIR HOME LIFE THEIR SPECIAL ABILITIES THEIR WEAKNESSES THEIR AMBITIONS HE ADVISES THEM RESTRAINS THEM ENCOURAGES THEM THE SYSTEM MAY BE OBJECTED TO AS EXPENSIVE IT IS EXPENSIVE THE EXPENSE IS FIRST FELT IN CONSTRUCTING THE BUILDING AND AFTERWARD FELT IN OPERATING IT SIX HOUSE PRINCIPALSHIGHER SALARIED THAN TEACHERS AND DOING NO TEACHING DOUBTLESS ADD TO THE PER CAPITA COST OF INSTRUCTION BUT SURELY THE RESULT OUGHT TO JUSTIFY THIS EXTRA COST IN INDIVIDUAL CASES HOWEVER IT IS TO BE FEARED THAT THE RESULTS DO NOT JUSTIFY THE EXTRA COST THE ACTIVITIES OF THE HOUSE PRINCIPALEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 293 ARE TOO LARGELY INTRAMURAL ATTENDANCE DISCIPLINE AND REPORTS ARE HIS CHIEF CONCERNS THIS SHOULD BE CHARGED UP TO THE INEFFICIENT HOUSE PRINCIPAL HOW EVER AND NOT TO THE HOUSE SYSTEM MILITARY FAILURES FOOD FOR TEACHERS THOUGHT THE FOLLOWING IS AN EXTRACT FROM A STATEMENT OF INSPECTOR BLAYNEY OF CAMP FUNSTON GIVING REASONS WHY MANY CANDIDATES FAILED TO SECURE COMMISSIONS IT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE FOR HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS TO IMPROVE SOME OF THESE SPECIFIC DIFFICULTIES REFERRED TO WITH GREAT ADVANTAGE TO THE PUPILS AND TO THE GENERAL TONE OF SCHOOL WORK PERHAPS THE MOST GLARING FAULT NOTED IN ASPIRANTS TO THE OFFICERS RESERVE CORPS AND THE ONE WHICH MIGHT BE CORRECTED BY PROPER ATTENTION IN OUR HIGH SCHOOLS PREPARATORY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES MIGHT BE CHARACTERIZED BY THE GENERAL WORD SLOUCHINESS I REFER TO WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED A MENTAL AND PHYSICAL INDIFFERENCE I HAVE OBSERVED AT CAMP FUNSTON MANY OTHERWISE EXCELLENT MEN WHO HAVE FAILED BECAUSE IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM SUFFICIENT EMPHASIS IS NOT PLACED UPON THE AVOIDANCE OF THIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HANDICAP AT CAMP FUNSTON AND OTHER MILITARY CAMPS MENTAL ALERTNESS ACCURACY IN THINKING AND ACTING CLEARNESS IN ENUNCIATION SURENESS AND EASE OF CARRIAGE AND BEARING MUST BE INSISTED UPON FOR TWO REASONS THAT SUCCESS MAY BE ASSURED AS NEARLY AS HUMAN EFFORT CAN GUARANTEE IT WITH THE MATERIAL AND MEANS AT HAND AND THAT PRICELESS HUMAN LIVES MAY NOT BE CRIMINALLY SACRIFICED ONLY BY THE POSSESSION OF THE QUALITIES REFERRED TO DOES ONE BECOME A NATURAL LEADER AT CAMP FUNSTON WE MUST TRAIN LEADERS A GREAT NUMBER OF MEN HAVE FAILED AT CAMP FUNSTON BECAUSE OF INABILITY TO ARTICULATE CLEARLY A MAN WHO CANNOT IMPART HIS IDEAS TO HIS COMMAND IN CLEAR DISTINCT LANGUAGE AND WITH SUFFICIENT VOLUME OF VOICE TO BE HEARD REASON ABLY FAR IS NOT QUALIFIED TO GIVE COMMANDS UPON WHICH HUMAN LIFE WILL DEPEND MANY MEN DISQUALIFIED BY THIS HANDICAP MIGHT HAVE BECOME OFFICERS UNDER THEIR COUNTRYS FLAG HAD THEY BEEN PROPERLY TRAINED IN SCHOOL AND COLLEGE IT IS TO BE HOPED THEREFORE THAT MORE EMPHASIS WILL BE PLACED UPON THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF ELOCUTION IN THE TRAINING OF OUR YOUTH EVEN WITHOUT PRESCRIBED TRAINING IN ELOCUTION A GREAT IMPROVEMENT COULD BE WROUGHT BY THE INSTRUCTORS IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES REGARDLESS OF THE SUBJECT INSISTING THAT ALL ANSWERS BE GIVEN IN A LOUD CLEAR WELLROUNDED VOICE WHICH OF COURSE NECESSITATES THE OPENING OF THE MOUTH AND THE FREE MOVEMENT OF THE LIPS IT IS REMARKABLE HOW MANY EXCELLENT MEN SUFFER FROM THIS HANDICAP AND HOW DIFFICULT AND ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE IT IS TO CORRECT THIS AFTER THE FORMATIVE YEARS OF LIFE IN ADDITION TO THIS PHYSICAL DISABILITY AND SLOUCHINESS IS WHAT MIGHT BE TERMED THE SLOUCHINESS OF MENTAL ATTITUDE MANY MEN FAIL TO MEASURE UP TO THE REQUIREMENTS SET FOR OUR OFFICERS RESERVE BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOT BEEN TRAINED TO APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF ACCURACY IN THINKING TOO MANY294 THE SCHOOL REVIEW SCHOOLS ARE SATISFIED WITH AN APPROXIMATE ANSWER TO A QUESTION LITTLE OR NO INCENTIVE IS GIVEN TO INCREASED MENTAL EFFORT TO COORDINATE ONES IDEAS AND PRESENT THEM CLEARLY AND UNEQUIVOCALLY INSISTENCE UPON DECISION IN THOUGHT AND EXPRESSION MUST NEVER BE LOST SIGHT OF IT IS NEXT TO IMPOSSIBLE FOR MILITARY INSTRUCTORS TO DO MUCH TO COUNTERACT THE NEGLIGENCE OF SCHOOLS IN THIS REGARD THIS AGAIN HAS COST MANY MEN THEIR COMMISSIONS AT CAMP FUNSTON AS A LAST IMPORTANT ELEMENT THAT SEEMS TO ME HAS BEEN LACKING IN THE MORAL AND MENTAL MAKEUP OF SOME OF OUR STUDENTS THERE IS THE CHARACTERISTIC OF GRIT NOT THAT THEY WOULD HAVE PROVED COWARDLY IN BATTLE NECESSARILY BUT SOME HAVE EXHIBITED A TENDENCY TO THROW UP THE SPONGE UPON THE ADMINISTRATION OF A SEVERE REBUKE OR CRITICISM THEIR FEELINGS HAVE BEEN HURT AND THEY RESIGN THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN TAUGHT THE TRUE SPIRIT OF SUBORDINATION THEY ARE NOT READY FOR THE ROUGH EDGES OF LIFE THE TRUE TRAINING SCHOOLS SHOULD ENDEAVOR TO INCULCATE THAT INDOMITABLE SPIRIT THAT ENABLES ONE TO GET OUT OF SELF TO KEEP ONES EYES FIXED UPON THE GOAL RATHER THAN UPON THE ROUGHNESS OF THE PATH TO REALIZE THAT ONE UNABLE TO RISE ABOVE THE FIRST HARD KNOCKS OF DISCIPLINE CANNOT HOPE TO FACE WITH EQUANIMITY THE TREMENDOUS RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OFFICER UNDER MODERN CONDITIONS OF WARFARE THIS IDEA OF GRIT BELONGS IN THE SCHOOLROOM AS WELL AS UPON THE CAMPUS A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION A DETERMINED EFFORT IS ON FOOT TO SECURE THE PASSAGE OF A LAW NOW BEFORE CONGRESS ESTABLISHING A FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AT THE REQUEST OF THE CHAIRMAN OF THE SENATE COMMITTEE ON EDUCATION THE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGE PRESIDENTS SUBMITTED A STATEMENT SETTING FORTH THE NEED SINCE EDUCATION IS UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AS THE FIRST COROLLARY OF DEMOCRACY IT SEEMS INCONGRUOUS THAT IT SHOULD NOT BE RECOGNIZED AS OF EQUAL RANK IN THE COUNCILS OF THE NATION WITH THAT ACCORDED COMMERCE LABOR AND AGRICULTURE ALL OF WHICH HAVE REPRESENTATIVES IN THE PRESIDENTS CABINET THE BURDEN OF THE COMMITTEES STATEMENT AS ELABORATED BY PRESIDENTS JUDSON MCCRACKEN AND CAMPBELL IS THAT THE EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES OF THE NATION BOTH DURING THE WAR AND AFTER THE WAR WILL HAVE UNPRECE DENTED OPPORTUNITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES IN SAFEGUARDING DEMOCRATIC INSTITUTIONS UNDER THE NEW CONDITIONS WHICH THE WAR HAS PRODUCED THE SUPREME IMPOR TANCE OF EDUCATION TO THE COUNTRY STANDS OUT MORE CLEARLY THAN EVER BEFORE THE GREAT IDEALS WHICH HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE MORE OR LESS IN SOLUTION BECOME THE WELLDEFINED DIRECTING MOTIVES IN THE NATIONAL CON SCIOUSNESS IN THE ABSENCE OF A STATE RELIGION THE EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATION OF THE COUNTRY MUST BE THE MEANS OF PLACING EMPHASIS ON THE GREAT MORAL ANDEDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 295 SPIRITUAL VALUES WHICH ARE ULTIMATELY THE DETERMINING FACTORS IN A NATIONS HISTORY BY THE ENLIGHTENMENT WHICH IT SPREADS AND THE EMPHASIS WHICH IT PLACES ON THE GREAT MORAL LAWS IT CAN PROVE A LARGE MEASURE OF SALVATION IN A SHIFTING SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ORDER WHICH WE ARE INEVITABLY FACING AT THE CLOSE OF THE WAR WHAT USE WILL BE MADE OF THE NEW MEASURE OF LEISURE WHICH SEEMS TO BE COMING TO THE WORKMAN AND WHAT APPLICATION HE WILL MAKE OF THE ENLARGED POWER WHICH IS ALREADY HIS WILL LARGELY BE DETERMINED BY THE PLACE WHICH IS ACCORDED EDUCATION IN THE NATIONAL LIFE THE ENLARGEMENT OF THE SUFFRAGE ALSO BRINGS WEIGHTY ADDITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE SCHOOLS THE NATIONS IDEALS CONSCIOUSLY EXPRESSED IN THE LIVES OF ITS PEOPLE DETER MINE ITS DESTINY AS HUMBOLDT HAS SAID WHAT WE DESIRE IN THE GOVERNMENT WE MUST FIRST PUT INTO THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE THROUGH THE SCHOOLS THIS AGITATION OF THE COLLEGES WAS HEARTILY SUPPORTED BY THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE SCHOOL MEN RECENTLY GATHERED IN ATLANTIC CITY AND BY A SCORE OF OTHER ASSOCIATIONS EMBRACING PRACTICALLY ALL OF THE MORE PROMI NENT EDUCATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF THE COUNTRY ALL SEE THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF A GREAT COORDINATING EDUCATIONAL AGENCY IN WASHINGTON THE EMERGENCY COUNCIL ON EDUCATION PRESIDENT J W CRABTREE CHAIRMAN SETS FORTH THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS ARISING OUT OF WAR CONDITIONS I THE GROUP OF PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE IMMEDIATELY INCREASED EFFICIENCY OF THE SCHOOLS TOWARD WINNING THE WAR I COORDINATION OF WORK OF SCHOOLS AND OF VARIOUS INDEPENDENT ORGANIZA TIONS AND AGENCIES 2 INCREASED SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH FOR WAR PURPOSES 3 TRAINING OF STUDENTS FOR ALL TYPES OF WAR SERVICE 4 EXTENSION OF EDUCATIONAL WORK IN MILITARY ENCAMPMENTS 5 EDUCATIONAL PROPAGANDALECTURES PAMPHLETS

PROBLEMS RELATING TO THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AFTER THE WAR I RECASTING OF COURSES OF STUDY IN LIGHT OF LESSONS OF THE WAR 2 SHORTENING PERIOD OF EDUCATION 3 APPROPRIATIONS AND EXPENSES OF MAINTENANCE 4 RELATIONSHIP OF SCHOOLS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 5 COLLECTION AND PRESERVATION OF WAR DATA OTHER PROBLEMS OF THE FUTURE NOT MENTIONED IN THE LIST ABOVE ARE I INCREASED FEDERAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR VOCATIONAL EDUCATION TOGETHER WITH THE NECESSITY OF ADJUSTING THE NEW TYPE OF SCHOOLS IN HARMONY WITH THE OLDER TYPE OF INSTITUTIONS 2 THE PROBLEM OF MAKING ENGLISH TRULY OUR NATIONAL TONGUE THERE ARE SECTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES IN WHICH THE MAJORITY OF CHILDREN ARE INSTRUCTED IN A FOREIGN TONGUE RECEIVING INSTRUCTION IN ENGLISH IF ANY AT ALL BUT VERY INCIDENTALLY CERTAINLY THIS REPRESENTS A CONDITION INIMICAL TO OUR NATIONAL SPIRIT A CONDITION IMPERATIVELY DEMANDING FEDERAL AUTHORITY 3 THE STANDARDIZATION OF HIGHER DEGREES PROFESSIONAL AND ACADEMIC IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF STATE ACTION 4 THE STANDARDIZATION OF QUALIFICATIONS FOR TEACHERS AND NATIONAL PLANS FOR THE CERTIFICATION AND EMPLOYMENT AT PRESENT DISTRIBUTION AND EMPLOYMENT OF TEACHERS ARE RENDERED DIFFICULT IN THE EXTREME BY CON FLICTING REQUIREMENTS OF THE VARIOUS STATES TWO MAJOR OBJECTIONS APPEAR TO BE URGED AGAINST THE FEDERAL DEPART MENT THE FIRST IS THE FAMILIAR ARGUMENT OF STATES RIGHTS AND LOCAL CON TROL THE REPLY IS THAT EDUCATION NEEDS EQUALIZING AND STANDARDIZING IN THIS FIELD NEED IS CERTAINLY AS GREAT AS IT WAS IN THE CASE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES CERTAINLY AS GREAT AS IT IS IN THE CASE OF MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE SEPARATE STATE ACTION IS BOUND TO RESULT IN A HODGEPODGE THE SECOND OBJECTION IS PERHAPS SOMEWHAT MORE VALID VIZ THAT THE PRESENT IS NOT OPPORTUNE FOR PRESSING THE QUESTION BECAUSE ALMOST ALL OF THE FEDERAL WAR SERVICES HAVE ALREADY UNDERTAKEN INDEPENDENT EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES AND THEREFORE AN ATTEMPT TO NATIONALIZE THEM WOULD RESULT IN DIFFICULTY AND CONFUSION TO THIS THE REPLY IS AGAIN THE IMPERATIVE NEED OF COORDINATION AND SUPERVISION OF ALL IN ORDER THAT EACH ENDEAVOR MAY BE MANAGED IN THE LIGHT OF THE TOTAL GOOD TO BE ACCOMPLISHED ENGLAND GERMANY FRANCE HAVE NATIONAL DEPARTMENTS OF EDUCATION WHY SHOULD EDUCATION IN THE GREATEST DEMOCRACY OF THEM ALL BE LEFT STRANDED IN ONE SUBBUREAU OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR

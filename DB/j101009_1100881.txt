J P BELL COMPANY THE MODIFICATION OF THE SUPPLYLIEN ACT AS AGAINST MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANIES ON THE 10TH DAY OF DECEMBER 1903 THE GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AP PROVED HOUSE BILL NO 189 AMENDING SECTION 2485 OF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA SO AS TO CAUSE IT TO READ AS FOLLOWS SEC 2485 LIEN OF EMPLOYEES AND SO FORTH OF TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES AND SO FORTH ON FRANCHISES AND PROPERTY OF COMPANY ALL CONDUCTORS BRAKEMEN ENGINE DRIVERS FIREMEN CAPTAINS STEWARDS PILOTS CLERKS DEPOT OR OFFICE AGENTS STOREKEEPERS MECHANICS TRAVELING REPRESENTATIVES OR LABORERS AND ALL PERSONS FURNISHING RAILROAD IRON

THEIR SERVICES OR LABOR TO ANY MINING OR MANUFACTURING COMPANY WHETHER SUCH RAILWAY CANAL OR OTHER TRANSPORTATION OR MINING OR MANUFACTURING COMPANY BE CHARTERED UNDER OR BY THE LAWS OF THIS STATE OR BE CHARTERED ELSEWHERE AND BE DOING BUSINESS WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THIS STATE SHALL HAVE A PRIOR LIEN ON THE FRANCHISES GROSS EARNINGS AND ON ALL THE REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SAID COMPANY WHICH IS USED IN OPERATING THE SAME TO THE EXTENT OF THE MONEYS DUE THEM BY SAID COM PANY FOR SUCH WAGES OR SUPPLIES AND NO MORTGAGE DEED OF TRUST SALE HYPOTHE CATION OR CONVEYANCE EXECUTED SINCE THE TWENTYFIRST DAY OF MARCH EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTYSEVEN SHALL DEFEAT OR TAKE PRECEDENCE OVER SAID LIEN PRO VIDED HOWEVER THAT THE LIEN SECURED BY THIS PROVISION TO PARTIES FURNISHING SUPPLIES SHALL BE SUBSEQUENT TO THAT DUE TO CLERKS MECHANICS AND LABORERS FOR SERVICES FURNISHED AS AFORESAID AND PROVIDED THAT IF ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO A LIEN AS WELL UNDER SECTION TWENTYFOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTYFIVE AS UNDER THIS SECTION SHALL PERFECT HIS LIEN GIVEN BY EITHER SECTION HE SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE OTHER AND PROVIDED ALSO THAT NQ RIGHT TO OR REMEDY UPON A LIEN WHICH HAS ALREADY ACCRUED TO ANY PERSON SHALL BE EXTENDED ABRIDGED OR OTHERWISE AFFECTED HEREBY 2 THIS ACT SHALL BE IN FORCE FROM ITS PASSAGE A COMPARISON OF THIS ACT WITH THE FORMER LAW AS GIVEN IN POLLARDS SUPPLEMENT IN LOC WILL SHOW THAT THE SINGLE MATERIAL 1 AND 2 NEW9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE OMISSION FROM THE FORMER LAW OF THE FOLLOWING WORDS AND ALL PERSONS FURNISHING SUPPLIES TO A MINING OR MANUFACTURING COMPANY NECESSARY TO THE OPERATION OF THE SAME SHALL HAVE A PRIOR LIEN UPON THE PERSONAL PROPERTY OF SUCH COMPANY OTHER THAN THAT FORMING PART OF ITS PLANT TO THE EXTENT OF THE MONEYS DUE THEM FOR SUCH SUPPLIES AND ALSO A LIEN UPON ALL THE ESTATE REAL AND PERSONAL OF SUCH COMPANY WHICH SAID LAST LIEN HOWEVER UPON ALL SUCH REAL AND PERSONAL ESTATE SHALL BE SUBJECT AND INFERIOR TO ANY LIEN BY DEED OF TRUST MORTGAGE HYPOTHECATION SALE OR CONVEYANCE MADE OR EXECUTED AND DULY ADMITTED TO RECORD PRIOR TO THE DATE AT WHICH SAID SUPPLIES ARE FURNISHED THIS ADDITION WAS MADE TO SECTION 2485 OF THE CODE OF 1887 BY THE ACT OF FEBRUARY 15 1892 ACTS 18912 P 362 THE ENACTMENT OF 1892 WAS OBNOXIOUS FROM THE STANDPOINT OF WISE LEGISLATION TO SEVERAL OBJECTIONS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THOSE NOW TO BE CONSIDERED ARE OF THEMSELVES SUFFICIENT TO CONDEMN IT ITS CHIEF VICE LAY IN THE PRIORITY WHICH IT GAVE TO THE SUPPLYMAN UPON PROPERTY NOT FORMING PART OF THE PLANT OVER ANY LIEN BY MORT GAGE OR OTHER HYPOTHECATION NOT RECORDED THIS WAS WHETHER INTEN TIONALLY OR NOT INGENIOUSLY EXPRESSED SO AS TO SUGGESTANOPPOSITECON STRUCTIONNAMELY THAT THE SUPPLY LIEN SHOULD BE SUBJECT AND INFE RIOR TO ANY OTHER LIEN WHICH HOWEVER NOTE ESPECIALLY MUST HAVE BEEN RECORDED BEFORE THE SUPPLIES WERE FURNISHED NOW AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS USAGE IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY TO RECORD HYPOTHECATIONS OF PERSONAL PROPERTY AND THE LEGAL RESULT IT WAS CLAIMED AT ONCE AT TACHED THAT PROVIDED ONLY THE FIRST ITEM OF A RUNNING ACCOUNT FOR SUPPLIES ANTEDATED THE PLEDGING BY A MANUFACTURING COMPANY OF A BOND PIECE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OR PERSONAL ASSET OF WHATEVER NATURE NOT FORMING PART OF ITS PLANT AS COLLATERAL SECURITY FOR THE LOAN OF MONEY THE HYPOTHECATION UNLESS RECORDED WOULD BE POST PONED TO THE SUPPLYLIEN ALTHOUGH THE GREATER PART OF IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN FOR ITEMS FURNISHED LONG AFTER THE HYPOTHECATION THIS WAS THE CONSTRUCTION PLACED UPON THE ACT BY THE LOWER COURT IN THE CASE OF MILLHISER MFG CO V GALLEGO MILLS CO ANTE P 144 BUT ONE WHICH THE COURT OF APPEALS PRONOUNCED IN EFFECT TO BE INTOLERABLE AND NOT TO BE THOUGHT OF IT DOES NOT REQUIRE THE LEADING OF A COURT TO CAUSE ANY MAN OF BUSINESS EXPERIENCE TO REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION THE MILLHISER CASE WAS AN EMININTLY EQUITABLE DECISION AS FAR AS IT WENT BUT IT DID NOT REACH THE EVIL PERMITTED BY THE ACT IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE ASSETS OF AN INSOLVENT CORPORATION THE LAW DEC 686MODIFICATION OF THE SUPPLYLIEN ACT UNDER THAT ACT ALLOWED SUCH A CONDITION AS THIS A MINING OR MAN UFACTURING COMPANY FAILS WITH 10000 ASSETS AND 20000 LIABILITIES DIVIDED AS FOLLOWS 10000 TO A PERSON WHO HAD FURNISHED SUP PLIES 9000 TO A PERSON WHO HAD LOANED IT MONEY 1000 TO AN INSURANCE COMPANY FOR PREMIUMS ON ITS PLANT RESULT THE SUPPLY MAN WOULD BE PAID IN FULL THE OTHERS WOULD GET NOTHING NOT THE LEAST BAD FEATURE OF THE LAW WAS THAT AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE THE PREFERRED CREDITORS WERE FOUND TO BE LARGELY NONRESI DENTS OF THE STATE WHILE THE HOMECREDITORS WHO HAD LOANED MONEY TO HELP THE COMPANY THROUGH ITS DIFFICULTIESPERHAPS TO PAY THESE VERY SUPPLYBILLSWERE POSTPONED IN THE CITY OF RICHMOND TWO YEARS AGO A SUIT WAS BROUGHT BY AN INSURANCE COMPANY A CREDITOR FOR PREMIUMS LONG OVERDUE TO WIND UP AN INSOLVENT MANUFACTUR ING COMPANY THE RESULT WAS THAT THE SUPPLYCREDITORS WERE PAID IN FULL WHILE THE CREDITOR WHO HAD FURNISHED SO INCONSIDERABLE A SUPPLY AS INSURANCE RECEIVED NOT A CENT THE TRUTH IS THAT THE ACT OF 1892 PASSED AS IT WAS IN EFFECT AT LEAST IN THE INTEREST OF THE SUPPLYCREDITORS OVERSHOT THE MARK IT GAVE THEM MORE THAN ANY STATE IN THE UNION SO FAR AS IS KNOWN TO THE WRITER GIVES THEM THEY ASKED AND OBTAINED TOO MUCH THE WONDER IS THAT THAT ACT WAS NOT REPEALED LONG AGO HAD THEY BEEN MODERATE IN THEIR DEMANDS BY CONFINING SUPPLIES TO ACTUAL RAW MA TERIAL HAD THEY BEEN GIVEN A SIMPLE LIEN AND HAD THEY PROVIDED REASONABLE LIMITATIONS FOR ITS BEGINNING AND END HAD THEY PRE SCRIBED A PERIOD AS IN THE MECHANICS LIEN ACTS WITHIN WHICH SUIT MUST BE BROUGHT TO ENFORCE THE LIENHADTHEYINAWORD PAID PROPEL REGARD TO VESTED RIGHTS WHETHER RECORDED OR NOT IT IS PROBABLE THAT NO VERY SERIOUS PROTEST WOULD HAVE BEEN MADE BUT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THE PRACTICAL DEMONSTRATIONS OF ITS DANGERS WHEN PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY WERE OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO SHOCK THE ORDINARY SENSE OF JUSTICE AND TO CAUSE THE QUESTION TO BE ASKED IS SUCH REALLY THE LAW  AND WHEN THIS WAS ANSWERED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE THE AMENDING ACT WENT THROUGH BOTH BRANCHES OF ITS OWN WEIGHT AND MERIT AS THE LARGE MAJORITIES FOR IT IN BOTH HOUSES INDICATED BEHIND WHAT OPPOSITION THERE WAS TO IT COULD BE PLAINLY DISTINGUISHED THE VOICE OF THE SUPPLYMANTHE PREFERRED CREDITORAND NO ONE WILL WONDER IF THE MANUFACTURER HIMSELF WHO WAS THE ALLEGED OBJECT OF THE TENDER SOLICITUDE OF THE MEASURE OF 1892 PROTESTED AGAINST THE NEW LAW HIS VOICE WAS NOT 1903 6879 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER HEARD STRANGELY ENOUGH THE PARTY WHO HUNG AROUND THE HALLS OF THE LEGISLATURE WHENEVER THE MEASURE WAS UNDER CONSIDERATION WAS A MANUFACTURER PLEADING FOR ITS PASSAGE FOR THE VERY LIFE OF HIS ENTERPRISE BECAUSE HE SAID UNDER THE OLD LAW HE COULD RAISE ABSO LUTELY NO MONEY TO PAY HIS EMPLOYEES OR CARRY ON HIS BUSINESS THOUGH UPON ITS REPEAL HE WAS PROMISED ANY REASONABLE CREDIT THE CHARGE HAS BEEN MADE THAT THE NEW LAW WAS ENACTED IN THE INTEREST OF THE BANKS AND OCCASION WAS TAKEN TO THROW THIS POPU LISTIC ODIUM UPON IT BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THE BANKS HAD AS A RULE CEASED LENDING MONEY TO THIS CLASS OF CORPORATIONS AT THE RISK OF HAVING THEIR CLAIMS POSTPONED TO A POCKETLIEN FILED MONTHS AND IT MIGHT AS EASILY BE YEARS AFTER THE LOAN IF AT ALL THEY WERE INTERESTED ONLY IN REMOVING THIS BAN FROM THE CREDIT OF AN OTHER WISE DESIRABLE LINE OF BORROWERS AND THUS EXTENDING THEIR BUSINESS WITHOUT MORE THAN THE USUAL RISK OF SACRIFICING THE ENTIRE DEBT WE SUBMIT IN CONCLUSION THAT A LIFE OF TEN YEARS HAVING PROVED ABUNDANTLY THE INEQUITY AND HARDSHIPS OF THE FORMER LAW HAVING DEMONSTRATED THAT IT WAS REALLY PASSED IN THE INTEREST OF THE PRE FERRED CREDITORS RECOGNIZED BY IT THAT ITS CHIEF EQUITY WAS INEQUAL ITY THAT ITS SPIRIT AND EFFECT HAVE BEEN REBUKED BY OUR COURT OF LAST RESORT AND THAT ITS REPEAL WAS URGED BY ITS ALLEGED BENEFICIARIES THE LEGISLATURE HAS ACTED WISELY IN CORRECTING THE MISTAKE OF ITS PREDE CESSOR AND IN UNDOING THIS CERTAINLY ONE OF THE MOST OBJECTIONABLE OF ALL THE FORMS OF CLASS LEGISLATION ANY LEGISLATION THAT INTRODUCES INTO COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS FAC TORS AND ELEMENTS WHOSE ESSENCE IS SECRECY AND UNCERTAINTY IS BOUND TO DISTURB THE SMOOTH COURSE OF BUSINESS WITH DOUBTS AND APPREHEN SIONS WHICH MUST RESULT IN A RESTRICTION OR DENIAL OF CREDITTHE LIFE OF COMMERCE THIS IS WHAT THE COURT OF APPEALS REFERRED TO IN THE MILLHISER CASE WHEN IT SAID SUCH A CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE DIS ASTROUS TO THE LABORER THE SUPPLYMAN THE MANUFACTURER AND OTHERS CONDUCTING INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES    IT IS OF THE HIGHEST IMPORTANCE AS HAS OFTEN BEEN REPEATED BY LAW WRITERS AND THE HIGH EST COURTS OF BOTH ENGLAND AND AMERICA TO PROTECT COMMERCIAL CREDIT AND THIS CAN ONLY BE DONE WHERE COMMERCIAL PAPER IS HELD INVIOLABLE IN THE HANDS OF BONA FIDE HOLDERS IT HAS ALSO OFTEN BEEN REPEATED THAT COURTS SHOULD BE ESPECIALLY CAREFUL NOT TO THROW DOUBT UPON MERCANTILE USAGES AND THE CUSTOMS OF BUSINESS MEN 688 DEC

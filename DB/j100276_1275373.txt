would descend to their respective heirs Wright et al v Knapp Mich 1915 I50 N W 315 As a general proposition a conveyance to a husband and wife as such creates an estate of entirety and does not make them joint tenants or ten ants in common Fisher v Provin 25 Mich 347 Aetna Ins Co v Resh 40 Mich 241 Jacobs v Miller 50 Mich II9 15 N W 42 The principal case is taken out of the general rule because a grantor cannot convey directly to himself The minority assuming this to be true still find a valid con veyance to the wife on the ground that where one of several grantees for any reason is incapable of taking one or others capable of taking shall take the whole Dozsett v Sweet I Ambler 175 Humphrey v Tayleur Id 136 Ball v Deas 2 Strob Eq S C 24 49 Am Dec 651 Cameron v Steves 9 N Brunsw 141 McCord v Bright 44 Ind App 275 87 N E 654 The majority treats the conveyance as reserving an equal interest to the grantor making him and his wife tenants in common and allowing their shares to descend to their respective heirs The minority seems to follow the spirit of the deed more closely than the remainder of the court inasmuch as the clear intention as expressed in the words the survivor to have full ownership of the same was to create a joint tenancy and where such is the case and one is unable to participate the survivor takes the entire estate Buffor v Bradford 2 Atk 220 Gardner v Printup 2 Barb 83 HUSBAND AND WIFEEXTINGUISHMENT OF ANTENUPTIAL DEBTSPlain tiff and defendant are wife and husband At the time of the execution by the plaintiff of the mortgage involved in this case they were not married Plaintiff instituted this action against defendant her husband to cancel the mortgage on the ground that it had been extinguished by the intermarriage of the parties Under the statute the wife has control over her property and can sue and be sued in respect thereto Held two judges dissenting that the common law doctrine as to the unity of husband and wife has been abrogated to the extent that the obligations incurred before the mar riage relation was entered into are not extinguished by the marriage McKie v McKie Ark I915 172 S W 891 The rule at common law was that the intermarriage of debtor and creditor extinguished the obligation Abbot v Winchester I05 Mass II5 Power v Lester 23 N Y 527 The reason for the rule was that the legal identity of the wife was merged in that of the husband and he became entitled to her personal property and the rents and profits of her real estate Butler v Ives I39 Mass 202 The question involved in the instant case whether modern statutes giving a wife control of her separate estate and the right to sue and be sued in respect thereto has abrogated the rule as to extinguishment of antenuptial debts by marriagehas been passed upon in several states Some courts have construed these statutes strictly and held that unless the rules at common law have been expressly changed they are still in full force and that therefore antenuptial debts are extinguished by marriage Long v Kinney 49 Ind 235 Shilling v Dormody o12 Tenn 518RECENT IMPORTANT DECISIONS 439 Smiley v Smiley 18 Oh St 543 Other courts have favored a more liberal construction of these statutes and held that antenuptial debts are not extinguished by marriage of debtor and creditor Wilson v Wilson 36 Cal 447 Clark v Clark 49 Ill App I63 This construction has even been adopted in states where husband and wife cannot sue each other Carlton v Carlton 72 Me 115 Butler v Ives 139 Mass 202 HUSBAND AND WIFEDOWERPlaintiffs husband conveyed a tract of land to defendant the chief value of which lay in gas and oil The husband is still living but he has deserted the plaintiff The plaintiff did not join in the conveyance Injunction was brought to enjoin the defendant from drilling for oil and gas and to prevent him from impairing her inchoate dower right Held one judge dissenting that the action was an unusual one that no case had been found in which waste had been enjoined during lifetime of the husband upon suit of wife for protection of her dower right that plaintiffs dower right was inchoate and subject to changes and depreciation which may occur during husbands lifetime Rumsey v Sullivan 1914 150 N Y Supp 287 Dower is said to be a favorite of the law Greene v Huntington 73 Conn io6 There are three things highly favored in lawlife

valuable consideration for a conveyance to the wife Bullard v Briggs 7 Pick 533 Smart v Haring I4 Hun 276 In proceeding for condemnation of real property under eminent domain the inchoate right of dower of the wife is recognized and protected in the proceeds as against the husband In re Brooklyn Bridge 143 N Y 640 A wife may maintain in the lifetime of the husband an action to cancel as forged arecorded deed purporting to have been executed by her to gether with her husband Clifford v Kampfe 147 N Y 383 The inchoate dower right has been recognized as such a right as to entitle the wife during the lifetime of the husband to redeem mortgaged land of husband sold under foreclosure McKenna v Fichlity Trust Co 183 N Y 411 Davis v Witherell 13 Allen 60 Patton v Stewart 19 Ind 233 Although the in choate dower right is not an estate in lands nor a vested interest therein it appears from the above citations to be a substantial right possessing in contemplation of law the attributes of property and to be estimated and valued as such 2 SCRIBNER DOWIR 8 and whenever the right has been threatened by destruction or impairment the courts have protected it Matter of Brooklyn Bridge I43 N

and a series of Notices of more than usual interest Three of the latter are by the late Professor Tisserand They are entitled 1 On the proper motion of the Solar System 2 On the fourth meeting of the Interna tional Committee for the photographic chart of the heavens 3 On the meeting of the International Committee for fundamental stars These notices by Tisserand have a sad as well as scientific interest for they are fol lowed by the orations delivered at his grave by Poincare Janssen and Loewy There is also a notice by Poincare on the Rontgen rays and one by Janssen on Epochs in the Astronomical History of the Planets These notices are not technical in character and all are very interesting The volume can be obtained for 30 cents and should be in the hands of all persons inter ested in any department of astronomy WE note the appearance of the British Nautical Almanac for the year 1900 It is in all respects similar to the volume for the preceding year In glancing over the preface of the work one cannot help no ticing how small has been the use made of the theoretical researches of British as tronomers Probably not one formula or constant of importance is taken from a published research of English origin And where results depend on observational series made in England these results are generally taken from discussions of the English obser vations by foreign astronomers It is a truism that science is international but truisms do not always penetrate govern ment offices The course of the British authorities must be highly commended for they have used what they thought was best for science without regard to the nationality of its origin H J SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS PROFESSOR SIMON NEWCOMB and Lord Kel vin have been elected honorary members of the St Petersburg Academy of Science Lord Ray leigh and M Callandreau have been elected corresponding members DR ARTHUR AUWERS the Berlin astronomer has been awarded a gold medal by the German Emperor

Le Conte Stevens he celebrated on January 14th his golden wedding Professor Le Conte has now returned to the University of California Al though seventyfour years of age Professor Le Conte retains all the energy and originality in research publication and teaching which during the past fifty years have accomplished so much for the advancement of science HEINRICH GXTKE the veteran ornithologist of Heligoland died on January 1st at the ripe age of 83 He is best known from his great work on Bird Migration which contains the results of more than half a century of close ob servation at a single pointthe rocky islet of Heligoland in the North Sea This small island is situated at a point where two great lines of migration meet and is the most favorable spot known in the world for studying the periodic movements of a very large number of birds Gatkes work is chiefly valuable as a record of facts of observation his deductions are not ac cepted by most American students of migration THE

speaking recently before the MedicoLegal Society called attention to the very unsatisfactory condition of expert testimony before courts ofjustice He had observed that juries were universally sceptical in regard to such testimony He said that he would favor the establishment of a board which would select men who would be qualified to serve as experts A NEW quarterly journal Archives danatomie microscopique is announced by Masson et Cie It will be under the direction of MM Balbiani and Ranvier and M Henneguy will act as managing editor WE have already announced the new journal Monatschriftfiir Psychiatrie und Neurologie edited by Professors Wernicke and Ziehen The first number has now been published at Berlin La Nature the French weekly journal of pop ular science will

by Ginn  Co for Cornell University REUTERS agency states that two Danish offi cers MM Oloufsen and Philipsen have just ar rived in St Petersburg on their return from a journey of exploration to the Pamir country where they reached places hitherto untrodden by Europeans They have brought back with them over 300 photographs of places they have visited and types they have met During their travels they met among others tribes who are still fireworshippers and totally uncivilized in their mode of life The men of these tribes and even their animals are of very small size the bulls and cows being no larger than a Euro pean foal the donkeys about the size of a large dog and the sheep about as large as a small poodle The use of money is unknown to them and their only trade consists in the bartering of furs Women are bought at the rate of five or six cows or fifteen sheep apiece These natives 183 are very timid and on the approach of strangers take to flight MM Philipsen and Oloufsen have secured numerous scientific collections which they intend presenting to the Natural History Museum in Copenhagen and have also made interesting meteorological observations In the course of their voyage they occasionally reached a height of 14000 ft above the level of the sea ACCORDING to the London Times an electric omnibus belonging to the London Electric Omnibus Company and propelled by electricity on the Radcliffe Ward system has made a suc cessful trial trip Starting from Northumber land Avenue it was able to ascend the com paratively steep slope of St Martins lane with out any difficulty although it was loaded with all but the full number of passengers it is con structed to carry and the streets were far from being in a good condition In the crowded traffic of Oxford street it showed itself to be per fectly under the control of the driver as regards both steering and speed It easily threaded its way among other vehicles and its pace could be regulated at will to pass almost everything else on the road or to crawl along with the slowest while its powerful brakes enabled it to be pulled up dead within a yard or two The pneumatic cushions interposed between the frame and the car do much to diminish vibra tion and the smoothness and easiness of the running are in marked contrast to the uneasy rumble which usually accompanies London omnibuses THE results of the quinquennial census of France taken on March 29 1896 show a population of 38518975 an increase of 125 027 during the five years The towns hav ing more than 30000 inhabitants show an in crease of 320000 Most of the agricultural dis tricts with the exception of Brittany show a decrease THE London Times reports that the Council of the Royal Colonial Institute for themselves and on behalf of about 4000 Fellows of the In stitute residing in all parts of her Majestys dominions have forwarded to the Prime Minister a memorial urging on the government the ad visability of taking early steps for the unification JANUARY 29 1897184 SCIENCE of time at sea a question which has been brought under the consideration of the Council by the Royal Society of Canada The memorial ists say that the various points connected with civil nautical and astronomical time at sea appear to have been fully gone into during the past twelve years by various societies and au thorities in different countries and to have been eventually resolved into the simple ques tion of the desirability of advancing astronomi cal time by twelve hours so as to harmonize it with civil time for nautical time has in general practice long been assimilated to civil time and is no longer a matter giving rise to difficulty or discussion It is believed by the memorialists that the proposed change can be easily intro duced with decided advantage to observers and that the general principle of the unification of time at sea has now an almost universal con sensus of opinion in its favor The advance ment of astronomical time by twelve hours so as to assimilate it to civil time in order that both may be in agreement and begin every where at midnight would require the adapta tion of the  Nautical Almanack to the change and as the  Nautical Almanack  is of necessity prepared some years in advance it is submitted that a decision should be arrived at by her Majestys government with as little delay as possible in order that the change may take effect at the date indicated by astronomers viz the first day of the new century THE general report on the operations of the survey of India during the year ending with September 1895 according to Nature shows that in this period the aggregate area surveyed on all scales amounts to 125384 miles exclusive of 5018 square miles embraced by traverse op erations in the central provinces and the north western provinces and Oude In the trigono metrical surveys the Upper Burma principal triangulation was carried northwards as well as westwards through Manipur and Assam In ad dition to the topographical work accomplished during the year a detachment with the Pamir commission surveyed 250 square miles and one with the Chitral relief force surveyed in detail 450 square miles on the 1inch scale 215 square miles on the iinch scale and approximately 1900 square miles on the inch scale The re N S VOL V No 109 sults of the operations of the latter surveyors is that considerable knowledge of the topography has been gained of an area of 3600 square miles of a country previously practically unknown and much credit is due to Captain Bythell and the men who served under him for such a satis factory record of work Two views represent ing the Malakand Pass and the Chitral bridge and fort have been reproduced by heliogravure to illustrate Captain Bythells report A mass of information on the forest survey operations cadastral surveys traverse surveys longitude observations geographical surveys and recon naissances carried out by the survey depart ment under the direction of Colonel C Strahan RE SurveyorGeneral of India is included in the general report MR GEORGE F KTUNZ in his report to the United States Geological Survey on the produc tions of precious stones in 1895 states that among the more interesting occurrences and changes in precious stones for the year 1895 may be mentioned 1 the finding of a 6carat diamond at a new locality Saukville Ozaukee County Wis 2 the diligent search made for monazite in North Carolina and Georgia re sulting in the finding of a number of interesting gems 3 continued finding of rubies near Franklin Macon County N C 4 the discov ery of true blue sapphires near Utica Fergus County Mont 5 the discovery of some re markable gem tourmaline of extraordinary size and wonderful perfection at the historic Paris Hill locality Oxford County Me 6 the find ing of a large quantity of fine chrysoprase in Tulare County Cal 7 the discovery of an enormous crystal of tourmaline on New York Island 8 the interesting exhibition of South ern gems at the Cotton States and International Exposition at Atlanta Ga and the presenta tion of this collection to the Lea collection at the United States National Museum and 9 the opening of the Golden Gate Park Museum at San Francisco with an interesting collection of gems Among foreign occurrences may be noted 1 the increased yield of the South African diamond fields and the absorption of the entire yield by the gem markets of the world 2 the occurrence of rubies of good color and in some abundance in various fieldsSCIENCE in Siam these are very rarely equal to the Burmese yet they are fine stones and although generally much lower in price a single stone sold for more than 1000 3 the great profu sion and beauty of the opal and the large de mand for these stones which were produced in greater quantity finer quality and at a some what lower cost than ever before from the fields at Fermoy Queensland and in the new locality at White Cliff in New South Wales THE article by Dr Dabney in the issue of this JOURNAL for January 15th pointing out the ad vantages of a National Department of Science was prepared at the suggestion of Hon Gardi ner G Hubbard who wrote to Dr Dabney as follows 1328 CONNECTICUT AVE WASHINGTON D C January 3 1897 DR CHARLES A DABNEY JR Washington D C DEAR SIR My attention has been called at differ ent times during the past year to the great number of scientists employed by the government and the large amount of appropriations I have also observed that the same subject seemed to be treated often un der two and sometimes under three departments thus leading to needless duplication of labor I know that your attention has been somewhat called to this subject I therefore venture to ask you if your time will permit to prepare an article for publication which shall bring out fully all these facts and also suggest a remedy which would seem to be the placiflg all this scientific work under one department I know of no one better fitted than yourself to perform this work and am sure that it will be carefully and correctly done Very truly yours GARDINER G HUBBARD HON CHARLES W DABNEY JR

of professors of the University of Berlin have asked permission from the Senate to inaugurate a system of university extension lectures It appears however that there is considerable opposition to the plan in Germany in part because it is supposed that many univer sity professors might favor the views of social democracy ACCORDING to the new Prussian Budget pro fessors in the University at Berlin

Willstitter of Karlsruhe has qualified as docent in chemistry in the Univer sity at Berlin DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE SIMPLIFIED SPELLING TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In a book no tice sent to you today you will observe two in stances of the innovation in spelling proposed by Funk  Wagnalls Instead of  grouped and  addressed I have written groupt and  addrest Unless special instructions are given your compositor and proofreader will ignore my attempt at reform and print these words according to the prevalent fashion Of this I cannot complain for it is certainly the privilege of a journal to unify its pages in the matter of spelling Neither am I disposed to criticize SCIENCE for not joining in the spelling reform movement for it would be unwise for a journal with its own battles to fight to incur the odium which attaches to rational spelling The prejudices in favor of irrational spelling are so strong and prevalent that they cannot be op posed without a certain measure of sacrifice on the part of the opponent Nevertheless it seems to me that SCIENCE may without harm to itself allow such of its contributors as have JANUARY 29 1897

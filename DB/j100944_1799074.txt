j100944,Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society of London,1799074,Route from Erzerum to Diarbekr,i303981,The following Papers were read  1Boute from Erzerum to Diarbekr By John G Taylor Esq HM Consul Diarbekr An abstract of this lengthy and important paper communicated by the author to Mr J K Lynch frgs was read to the meeting Mr Taylor stated that from Erzerum as far as Erzengan his route lay over an oftentravelled country and being well known did not require any further description  but from Erzengan he traversed a country as far as Mazgerd and Kharput hitherto quite unknown to Europeans even to that old Asiatic traveller Barbaro though he must have been very near the line of road which he Mr Taylor found so well repaid his trouble By reference to the map it would be seen that only two practic able routes are known from the north through the Deyrsim Moun tains to the plain of Kharput Theyboth concentrate at Mazgerd and had already been described by Mr Taylor in a paper trans mitted to the Eoyal Geographical Society The object of the pre sent journey was to trace a third route through the mountains also to Mazgerd the debouching point as shown in the paper above mentioned of all communications between Kharput and the north and to search for ancient inscriptions whichMazgerd having occupied as the author had pointed out a prominent place in that periodhe hoped would be found in its vicinity both objects he was glad to report had been realised In his previous memoir he had given a full account of Mazgerd its old Pyre appertaining to the Parsee worship and some facts relative to its ancient historya recapitulation of which would here be useless but it was necessary to bear that description in mind as adding much interest to the present route which leaving ErzenganJune 22 1868 ROUTE FROM ERZERUM TO DIARBEKR 303 follows the south side of the plain on which that town is situated and enters the low mountains of the Koozichan district in which the plain is lost These mountains further on rise higher and higher culminating in the snowcapped heights of the Deyrsim which as seen from this point seem to bar all further progress before reaching which the party came to a village called Pilameer which was from Erzengan the first stage on the road The name Pilameer may easily be derived from or be an abbre viation of Pul El Ameer the Ameers Bridge On his arrival he was very hospitably received by the Kizzelbash chief Shah Hoosein Beg whom he induced ultimately to conduct him through the new route From Pilameer Mr Taylor was surprised to find a good road though hilly in parts leading through the Koozichan district as far as the Deyrsim range through which though popular error repre sented it as inaccessible a remarkably easy route exists all the way to Mazgerd never he believed since the days of the Seleu cidae traversed by civilised beings and which the jealousy of the Kurds has hitherto concealed from foreigners for the obvious reason that the former do not wish it known that so easy a route exists through their formidable mountains It passes through undulating valleys studdcd with thriving villages and the country on either side is beautifully wooded with oak pine and poplar and opens here and there into fine level wellwatered plains Two con siderable affluents of the Muzoor Su that great tributary of the Murad Su or Upper Euphrates rise in these valleys called by natives the Dor Boghaz Su and the Hidor Kighi or Pirzi Su the former joins the Muzoor Su near Pakh and the latter at Pirzi Neither of these great affluents appears on any map and the course of the main stream of the Muzoor Su as laid down by Kiepert is altogether erroneous as would be hereafter pointed out The ruins which exist in and about the villages are principally the remains of old churches mediaeval Armenian some of them being not more than five or six hundred years old These valleys are inhabited by a numerous population of Kurds though a few members sparsely scattered of the Armenian nation still exist on mere suiFerance and of course are comparatively indigent The Kurds appear well off and the seclusion which they enjoy protects them from the impositions and taxes laid on their less fortunate brethren Two hours before reaching Mazgerd a place is reached where volcanic action has thrown up a large mass of needlepointed rock which has at one time been scarped and formed into an im pregnable castle Where it could not be scarped and round its weak points are traces of Pelasgic walls No real building is to 2 A 2304 ROUTE FROM ERZERUM TO DIARBEKR June 22 1868 be seen on the rock which has been hollowed out and chambers and galleries formed which are ornamented with some taste by a waving scroll having been sculptured round the roofs and door ways On the very top of this mass of rock are the remains of a room or probably an old temple from which an extensive view of the mountains and plains about as far as Kharput is obtained Before each gate is a vaulted entrance or portico furnished with seats all of which are cut out of the rock On the walls of one of these porticos Mr Taylor had the good fortune to find his anticipa tions crowned by the discovery of a cuneiform inscription of sixteen lines which from the character he hoped would turn out Assyrian and probably one of Tiglath Pilesers The position of this inscription in the old gate is very interesting as determining in some measure its great age and as corroborating the authors opinion communicated in a former memoir that Mazgerd was the gate of the Deyrsim and commanded the easiest shortest and most practicable route through the mountains to the north and the Black Sea He set to work and took a east of the inscriptions which he transmitted by a Tartar messenger to Erzerum to be thence sent to Sir Henry Eawlinson Opposite this cuneiform inscription was an elaboratelyformed cross which shows that this castle occupied a prominent position in two widely distant periods of history Mr Taylor added that he had also made many observations and col lected materials for a new map which with the one previously forwarded would he hoped give a good and true idea of this country The original Paper will be printed in extenso in the Journal vol xxxviii The President said this was but a very brief abstract of one of the most elaborate and valuable communications on comparative geography that had ever been made to the Eoyal Geographical Society By the courtesy of Lord Stanley the original documents which were communicated to the Foreign Oflice had been upon the representation of their President transferred to the possession of the Royal Greographical Society Therefore in the first place they had to return their best thanks to Lord Stanley and the Foreign Office He regretted the absence of Sir Henry Eawlinson who was best able to do justice to Mr Taylors researches into the historical sites and antiquarian remains of Kurdistan He saw present however one gentlemenMr Lynch who knew a great deal of that region and he should be glad to hear from him any observations he might wish to make Mr Lynch thought the paper was one of great interest as it opened up a  Note by Sir Henry Rawlinson This inscription although written in the Assyrian character is in the old Armenian language and belongs to Ruza son of Arghisu who was king of the mountains of Nairi Arghisti was contemporary with Sargon and Sennacherib Ruza with Esar Haddon and Asshurbanipal Sar danapalus It probably dates from about bc 660 and is the latest Armenian inscription yet foundJune 22 1868 DISCUSSION ON MR TAYLORS PAPER 305 country of which we really knew scarcely anything We had hitherto been entirely ignorant of this line of communication rediscovered hy Mr Taylor between the valley of the Euphrates Babylon Assyria and indeed all those seats of the earliest civiiisation and Europe He Mr Lynch had himself travelled over that country from Constantinople hy two routes into Southern Asia one by Tabreez and Persia and the other by Aleppo and Syria the more southern route He had also travelled by a third route the direct one from Constantinople to Baghdad over the Mehrab Dagh the highest and most inaccessible of the Taurus ranges which was a most difficult passage par ticularly in the winter An expedition under Colonel now Sir Fenwick Williams sent out to determine the Persian and Turkish boundary was shut up for months by the snow in this region and it was supposed there was no possible way of getting into Southern Asia except over this Mehrab Dagh The value of Mr Taylors paper consisted in this that he had discovered a route the whole way from Erzerum to Kharput so easy that a railway could be laid down along it In addition to this Mr Taylor had found very in teresting inscriptions in the cuneiform character illustrating the history of that country in a remarkable degree One discovery was a small gold vase which was now in his Mr Lynchs possession and a lithographic drawing now lay on the table for the inspection of the meeting  it had been dug out of a mound near Nisibin and had been pronounced by connoisseurs to be of the true Assyrian type Lord Houghton said the paper related to countries of so much historical importance that he regretted it had not been delivered to us in further detail He thought it was a curious illustration of the value of the Royal Geographical Society in awakening an interest in what he might call the bypaths of known countries The great caravanroutes round this district were as wellknown to ordinary geographers as the railroads of England But there was this feature that in the middle of Kurdistan there existed a perfectly easy mountainroad unknown to the travellers who passed through the country It was kept almost from the knowledge of the Government of the country itself and yet it was full of beauty and interest He thought we might be proud that the Geographical Society did help towards these discoveries by exciting the attention and endeavours of travellers We knew all the great aspects of the world we knew all the great routes of the world we knew by inference and analogy the nature and peculiarities of most districts of the world which had not yet been visited It remained for this Society and other similar societies to do what was most important and most useful namely to complete the work of investigating these little interior spheres of unknown countries such as the present which had been visited by Mr Taylor He could only recommend that other travellers should undertake a similar work in other regions and present their reports to this Society

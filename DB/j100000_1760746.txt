already been noticed Science vol v p 157 and it only remains for us to direct attention to the larger part of the complete volume part ii devoted to physiology The present volume is especially welcome from the fact that it is the finest work of the kind published in this country The nearest approach to it is the textbook by Dr Bessey Until now we have been obliged to depend upon reprints from the German for all textbooks upon this very important department of botanical science but it is to be hoped that the issue of the work before us is indicative of a permanent change in this direction and that for the future we may have standard textbooks capable of bringing the stu dent into intimate acquaintance with the most recent acquisitions In its general makeup the book is very credit able and a decided improvement upon the usual appearance of textbooks The paper and letter press are good while the figures of which the publishers have granted the author a fairly liberal allowance are fresh  an evident effort having been made to avoid stereotyped illustrationsand in most cases admirably well executed The refer ences to the literature of the various subjects treated are quite full and will be found a most valuable aid to the student as also will the large amount of additional matter embodied in the footnotes The student is also provided at the end of the volume with a large number of suggestions as to the apparatus and materials required in both histological and physiological studies Also as of special advantage to those wishing to follow an independent course of study there are many valuable suggestions as to the subjects which may be most profitably considered Valuable as such suggestions are however they can only serve as a basis and the student must of necessity outline his own course to a very large extent since he would otherwise find it physically impossible to accomplish all that might seem desirable The author has endeavored to leave no im portant physiological fact without discussion while his entire treatment of the subject as a whole will commend itself to teachers generally as clear and logical although in many instances there appears to be a lack in fulness of treatment which would be highly desirable but which would hardly be practicable in the limits of a book de signed for an ordinary course of instruction In some instances however this becomes a fault since the abbreviations are sometimes car ried to such an extent as to give the student an TOCE VOL VI No 147 imperfect conception of the subject discussed Such however are minor faults and are almost inseparable from necessary curtailment of dis cussion They all readily disappear under the guidance of a competent teacher and the author is certainly to be congratulated upon having re duced errors of all kinds to a minimum While giving the most recent views obtained the author wisely errs on the side of prudence in not allowing himself to give too great weight to opinions which are not fully justified Our knowledge of both histology and physiology is now advancing at such a rapid rate that many errors of omission and possibly in some cases of fact also are almost inseparable from a work of this kind The time which elapses between the reception of the manuscript by the publisher and of the book by the public is sufficient to make many statements old and often to upset previous views Bearing this in mind the book is fully up to the times and we can commend it as destined to meet in a most acceptable manner a longfelt want HORNADAYS TRAVELS IN BORNEO ALL things considered this is one of the most satisfactory books of its kind that we have seen for many a day Its author possesses to a marked degree the happy but rare faculty of knowing just how much science the general reader likes to have mixed with his narrative and also how to give it to him without missing either the science or the narrative Mr Hornadays style is none of the best but there is such a freshness such a genuine ring and such a realness to his narration that one is willing to overlook his many deficiencies in the art of expression his numerous inelegancies and even his incessant use of slang words and phrases In fact the most serious objection we have to the book lies in another direction and is something for which the publisher is more to blame than the author We refer to its weight  a little less than three pounds avoirdupois Now there is no ob jection to printing dictionaries and other works of reference in large heavy tomes Such books are designed merely for reference and can be used when lying open on a table or bookrest But when it comes to asking ones readers to sit solemnly down to a narrative of sport and adventure as to a Websters unabridged or a consular report it is ask ing too much Mr Hornadays journey to the jungle  which simply means woods  was undertaken for the purpose of procuring specimens for Mr Wards Two years in the jungle By WILLIAM T HORNADAY New York Charles Scribners sons 1885 T1 jNOVEMBER 27 18851 SCIE wellknown establishment at Rochester From a commercial point of view the venture must have been very successful although our author was compelled while in Ceylon to bottle his snakes and fishes in methylated spirits upon which the Ceylon authorities had collected a duty of four hundred per cent He protested in vain for the money had been paid by his bankers before his arrival on the scene and the customs authorities refused to refund even when he offered  to take the unlucky case of spirits through the custom house and bury it in a quiet corner of the back yard where it would not smell bad The offi cers only replied  Couldnt do it couldnt do it  They had those rupees our author declares  and meant to keep them Naturally in the course of two years in the jungles of Ceylon India Selangore and Borneo one has many hairbreadth escapes But the ad venture which he asserts was ten times more dangerous than any I experienced with the head hunters of Borneo was experienced much nearer home It was while engaged in skeletonizing some jackasses in the Emerald Isle that he was set upon by  a mob of wild Irishmen who assailed him with longhandled hoes on the ground that the donkeys had been murdered He was finally allowed to depart by stealth after having been boycotted for a few days with his own bones intact but without his asinine skeletons These quotations will serve to show not merely the authors unhappy lack of skill in expression but also the pleasant and truly American way he had of looking on mishaps which would have driven the average British sportsman to the Times or an insaneasylum One of the quaint features of the work and one which we should have been very sorry to miss is the way in which he loses the sportsman and nar rator in the collector and naively tells us where this or that stuffed effigy can be found Thus after describing an elephant hunt and the subse quent skinning at a time when the elephant was several days older than when he died he adds t The old tusker who fell under such romantic circumstances on the Animallai slope now stands still  the monarch of all he surveys in the Museum of comparative zoology of Harvard university Cambridge Mass The whole volume is entertaining though the most interesting portion perhaps is that wherein Borneo with its headhunting Dyaks its tree jumping gibbons and its unpleasantly human orangoutangs is described Without disparaging the work of Wallace Bock and others this is the best description of Borneo so far as it goes to be found in the books Our author views the Dyak YCE 473 in the innermost recesses of his house and tells us how he eats drinks sleeps dresses and earns his living It is worth noting that Mr Hornaday takes issue with Wallace as to the maximum height of the orangoutang which Wallace gives as four feet and two inches Our author and his hunters killed or captured fortythree no less than seven of which measured more than four feet two inches one a Simia Wurmbii meas uring when fresh four feet and a half from the top of his head to the sole of his foot We wish that there was space to describe the man ner in which Mr Hornaday captured crocodiles with hook and line and many other curious feats but it is impossible The book is finely illustrated with sketches photographs and a few other pic tures It further contains two moderately good maps and but for its bulk would be a most wel come addition to the library ASTRONOMICAL NOTES First observation of Nova Andromedae  The earliest observation of the new star thus far re ported was by M Gully director of the public observatory at Rouen on Aug 17 and as M Tempel director of the observatory at Florence affirms that it was not visible on the 15th and 16th we are not likely to get much nearer the time of its first appearance In lAstronomie for November which gives the above facts M Trouvelot also states that a 13 mag star which precedes the nova about 20S and is a little south of it and which is now visible with an 8inch is not put down upon a drawing of the nebula which he made in 1874 with the 15inch of the Harvard college observatory and that he does not think it could have escaped him if as bright then as now It would seem as if this nebula were an object that should be watched pretty constantly and of which a series of comparable photographs at stated intervals would be especially valuable Wiregauze screens as photometers  Of late years the use of wiregauze screens one or more in number over objectives has come into use for several purposes Over one of the halves of a heliometerobjective they are used to reduce the image of a bright star to approximate equality with that of a fainter star from the other half an essential condition for the most accurate super position of the two images With a meridian circle they are used to reduce the brighter stars to an approximate equality with the faintest that can be observed with satisfactory precision or to investigate the difference of personalequation for different magnitudes by taking different tallies of transitwires with screen off and on at the same

BY THE LATE MR JOSHUA HASKINS AND IMPROVD BY J T DESAGU LIERS LL D R S S M R HASKINS FINDING THAT ALL HYDRAULIC ENGINES WORKING WITH PUMPS LOSE A GREAT DEAL OF WATER ALWAYS GIVING LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF STROKES OUGHT TO GIVE ACCORDING TO THE CONTENTS OF THE BAR RELS AND THAT WHEN THE PISTONS ARE NEW LEATHERD TO PREVENT THAT LOSS THE FRICTION IS MUCH INCREASD AND THE ENGINES ARE SUBJECT TO JERKS WHICH IN GREAT WORKS DO OFTEN DISORDER AN ENGINE FOR A GREAT WHILE BY BREAKING SOME OF THE PARTS CONTRIVD A NEW WAY OF RAISING WATER WITHOUT ANY FRICTION OF SOLIDS MAKING USE OF QUICKSILVER INSTEAD OF LEATHER TO KEEP THE AIR OR WATER FROM SLIPPING BY THE SIDES OF THE PI STONS IN THE BARRELS WHERE THEY WORK HOPING THERE BY TO PREVENT ALL THE ABOVESAID INCONVENIENCES AND ALSO TO HAVE WATER ENGINES LESS LIABLE TO BE OUT OF ORDER THAN ANY YET MADE THE FIRST EXPERIMENT HE MADE WITH AN ENGINE THAT HE SET UP AT MY HOUSE ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO WHICH I REPEATED BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN A MODEL AND THO BY THE ILL CONTRIVANCE OF THE PARTS IT DID NOT RAISE NEAR THE QUANTITY OF WATER THAT THE INVENTION IS CAPABLE OF YET I SHALL DESCRIBE THE MACHINE HERE BECAUSE IT WILL SERVE FOR THE BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF OUR PRESENT ENGINE B F I G6 F I G I DDDD REPRESENTS A LIGNUM VITAE PLUG OR PISTON WHICH MR HASKINS CALLD A PLUNGER ABOUT 6 FOOT LONG MADE HEAVY ENOUGH WITH LEAD AT TOP TO SINK INTO MERCU RY WHICH IS BEFOREHAND POURD INTO THE BARREL D 1 D 2 UP TO M M THE CHAIN E 1 E 2 JOYND TO THE PISTON AND THE POWER THAT MOVES IT BEING LET DOWN TILL THE PISTON COMES TO D 2 THE MERCURY RISES TO THE SAME HEIGHT IN THE BARREL AND IN THE RECEIVER R WHICH IT FILLS NAMELY TO N N AS APPEARS IN THE FI GURE THEN DRAWING UP THE PISTON TILL ITS BOTTOM IS COME TO M M THE MERCURY COMING OUT OF THE RE CEIVER DOWN TO O O MAKES A VACUUM AND THE WEIGHT OF THE ATMOSPHERE CAUSES THE WATER TO RISE UP THRO THE SUCKING PIPE A 1 A 2 AND VALVE V INTO THE RECEIVER WHERE THE MERCURY WAS BEFORE UPON LET TING DOWN THE PISTON AGAIN THE MERCURY RISES INTO THE RECEIVER AND DRIVES UP THE WATER THRO THE ELBOW B THE FORCING VALVE U AND SO UP THE FORCING PIPE A 2 A  BUT WHEN ONCE THE FORCING PIPE WHICH HERE WAS 46 FOOT HIGH IS FULL BEFORE ANY MERCURY CAN EN TER INTO THE RECEIVER AND FORCE ANY WATER OUT AT THE TOP OF THE PIPE A 1 THE MERCURY BETWEEN THE PISTON AND BARREL MUST RISE UP TO Q Q NEAR 3  FEET ABOVE THE BOTTOM OF THE RECEIVER AND AS IT CONTINUES TO RISE UP TO P P THE WATER IS THROWN OUT WITH A VELOCITY PROPORTIONABLE TO THE HEIGHT THAT THE MERCURY IS RAISD ABOVE THE 14TH PART OF THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER NOW THO THE FRICTION OF SOLIDS IS HERE AVOIDED IT IS PLAIN THAT THE MERCURY MUST MOVE FROM M M TO Q Q WITHOUT RAISING ANY WATER AND THAT IT CAN ONLY FORCE IN GOING FROM Q Q TO P P AND ONLY SUCK IN FALLING FROM O O TO M M AND UNLESS THE PISTON IS STOPPD A LITTLE7 LITTLE WHILE WHEN AT LOWEST THE WATER WONT HAVE TIME TO RUN OUT SO LIKEWISE THE PISTON MUST BE STOPPD WHEN AT HIGHEST THAT THE RECEIVER MAY HAVE TIME TO FILL MR HASKINS LIKEWISE PROPOSED ANOTHER WAY REPRE SENTED IN FIG 2 WHERE THE SAME LETTERS REPRESENT THE SAME PARTS ONLY HERE THE BARREL IS MOVEABLE BY THE TWO CHAINS E 1 E 2 AND INSTEAD OF A SOLID PISTON THE HOLLOW CYLINDER C 1 C C IS FIXD AND THE MERCURY MOVING UP AND DOWN IN THE LOWER PART OF IT SUCKS AND FORCES THE WATER THRO THE ELBOW THE FIGURE REPRESENTS THE ENGINE SUCKING BY MEANS OF THE MER CURY HANGING FROM O O TO M M IN ORDER TO FORCE BE FORE ANY WATER CAN BE DRIVEN OUT THE MERCURY IN THE INNER CYLINDER MUST DESCEND FROM O O TO M M AND RISE UP TO P P BETWEEN THAT CYLINDER AND THE BARREL SO THAT HERE ALSO A GREAT DEAL OF TIME IS LOST BESIDES THE GREAT QUANTITY OF MERCURY USD WHICH IS VERY EX PENSIVE BECAUSE AS MUCH MERCURY IS MOVD EVERY STROKE AS THE WATER RAISD THESE DIFFICULTIES VERY MUCH PUZZLED MR HASKINS AND QUITE DISCOURAGD SOME OTHER PERSONS THAT HAD GOT THE SECRET OF THE INVENTION AND WERE SETTING UP AGAINST HIM BUT WHEN I HAD CONSIDERD THE MATTER A LITTLE THO I HAD NOT TIME TO CONTRIVE A MACHINE FOR IT I TOLD HIM THAT A LITTLE MERCURY MIGHT BE MADE TO RAISE A GREAT QUANTITY OF WATER AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE SUCH A LOSS OF TIME AS IN HIS ENGINES BUT THAT I WOULD HAVE HIM FIND IT OUT BEFORE I ASSISTED HIM FARTHER IN A LITTLE TIME HE FOUND OUT THE CON TRIVANCE REPRESENTED IN FIG 4 AND AFTERWARDS THAT OF FIG 3 WHICH LAST WAS WHAT I HAD THOUGHT OF AND BOTH THESE WERE ALSO FOUND OUT BY THE LATE MR WILLIAM UREEM WHO WAS AN EXCELLENT MECHANICK B 2 F I G8 F I G III HERE THE BARREL IS MOVD AS IN FIG 2 BUT THE PLUG D D D TAKING UP A GREAT DEAL OF SPACE THERE IS OC CASION FOR NO MORE MERCURY THAN WHAT WILL MAKE A CONCAVE CYLINDER OR SHELL UP TO P P BETWEEN THE BAR REL D 1 D 2 AND THE HANGING CYLINDER C 1 C 2 C C WHEN THE STROKE IS MADE FOR FORCING AND A CONCAVE CYLINDER BETWEEN THE PLUG AND C 1 C 2 C C WHEN THE SUCTION IS MADE I GAVE MR HASKINS THE PROPORTIONS FOR AN ENGINE THIS WAY OF WHICH HE MADE A DRAUGHT AND SHEWD IT TO THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE LORD CHAN CELLOUR ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO THIS I MENTION HERE THAT NO BODY MAY ENDEAVOUR TO GET A PATENT FOR THIS INVENTION TO THE PREJUDICE OF MR HASKINSS ASSIGNESS WHO SINCE HIS DEATH HAVE DESIRD ME TO ASSIST THEM IN PERFECTING THE ENGINE F I G IV HERE THE BARREL WITH A THIRD CYLINDER DDDD IN STEAD OF THE PLUG OF FIG 3 IS LIFTED UP AND DOWN EVERY STROKE AND THE WATER PASSES THRO DDDD THE MER CURY MAKING A SHELL SOMETIMES BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND INNER CYLINDER AS IN THE SUCTION AND SOMETIMES BE TWEEN THE BARREL AND THE MIDDLE CYLINDER AS IN THE FORCING STROKE MR HA KINS HAD CONTRIVD SUCH A MACHINE AS IS RE PRESENTED BY THIS 4TH FIGURE AND BESPOKE THE SEVERAL PARTS BEFORE HE DYD AND THEREFORE WHEN I WAS DE SIRD BY HIS ASSIGNEES TO DIRECT THE SETTING UP THE MA CHINE I WAS OBLIGD TO MAKE USE OF THE PIECES ALREA DY MADE IN ORDER TO SAVE THE EXPENCE OF A NEW ENGINE AND NOW THE WHOLE PUT TOGETHER WITH SOME AL9 ALTERATIONS MAKE THE ENGINE REPRESENTED BY FIG 5 AS IT IS SET UP AT MY HOUSE IN WESTMINSTER AND BY THE FORCE OF ONE MAN RAISES A HOGSHEAD OF WATER IN LITTLE MORE THAN A MINUTE AND A HALF TO THE HEIGHT OF 27 FEET ALL THE FAULT OF THE MACHINE OF FIG 5 IS THAT THE PENDULUM HANDLE F F IS TOO LONG AND THE BOTTOM OF THE MIDDLE CYLINDER C OUGHT TO BE JUST IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HEIGHT TO WHICH THE WATER IS TO BE RAISD SUPPOSING THREE COPPER CYLINDERS TO BE AS THEY ARE HERE IF LIKEWISE THE BARREL D 1 D 2 WORKD UNDER THE FORCING PIPE THE LIFT WOULD BE EASIER THEREFORE I DESCRIBE THE MACHINE WITH THE SMALL ALTERATION REPRESENTED IN FIG 6 THE SUCKING AND FORCING PIPE AND VALVES ARE MARKD WITH THE SAME LETTERS AS IN THE OTHER FIGURES AND THE CHAINS E 1 E 2 MUST BE SUPPOSD TO HANG FROM SUCH PULLIES AND TO BE MOVD BY SUCH A PENDULUM AS IS IN FIG 5 THE BARREL D 1 D 2 CALLD OTHERWISE THE OUTER CYLINDER AND REPRESENTED BY THE SAME LET TERS IN FIG 7 HAS WITHIN IT ANOTHER CYLINDER CALLD THE INNER CYLINDER OR PLUG AS DDDD FIG 7 BETWEEN WHICH TWO CYLINDERS A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF MERCURY IS POURD IN AND THE HANGING CYLINDER C COMING DOWN INTO THE MERCURY A STROKE OF 13 INCHES MAY BE MADE BY THE MOTION OF THE BARREL WHICH IN GO ING DOWN SUCKS BY MAKING A VACUUM IN C AND IN GOING UP FORCES THE WATER OUT OF THE TOP OF THE FORCING PIPE PERFORMING THE OFFICE OF A COMMON PI STON ONLY THAT INSTEAD OF LEATHER TO MAKE IT TIGHT TO THE CYLINDER C THERE IS ALWAYS A THIN SHELL OF QUICKSILVER EITHER BETWEEN THE MIDDLE CYLINDER C AND THE INNER ONE DDDD FIG 7 AS HAPPENS WHEN THE SUCTION IS MADE OR BETWEEN THE MIDDLE AND OUTER CYLINDER AS HAPPENS IN LIFTING UP THE BARREL TO FORCE IN THE SUCTION THE MERCURY IS HIGHER IN THE INNER10 INNER SHELL THAN IN THE OUTER SHELL BY AN HEIGHT E QUAL TO A LITTLE MORE THAN 114 PART OF THE HEIGHT OF THE BARREL ABOVE THE WATER TO BE RAISD AND IN FORCING IT IS HIGHER IN THE OUTER SHELL THAN IN THE INNER BY A LITTLE MORE THAN 114 OF THE HEIGHT OF THE PILLAR OF WATER TO BE FORCD AND THEREFORE IF THE WATER IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE RAISD ABOVE 64 FEET THE BARREL SHOULD MOVE SO AS TO MAKE THE MIDDLE OF ITS STROKE AT THE HEIGHT OF 30 FEET OR AT THE MIDDLE OF THE WAY FROM THE WATER TO BE RAISD TO THE DELIVERY AT TOP THE 7TH FIGURE DRAWN BY A LARGER SCALE REPRESENTS THE THREE CYLINDERS WHICH ARE HERE MADE OF COPPER IN THEIR JUST PROPORTIONS AND FOR THE SAKE OF THOSE THAT WOULD CONSIDER THIS MATTER FULLY I HAVE HERE GI VEN THEIR LENGTHS DIAMETERS WITHIN AND WITHOUT AND THICKNESS OUTER CYLINDER MIDDLE OR HANG INNER CYLINDER OR OR BARREL D1 D2 ING CYLINDER IN PLUG CLOSED AT TOP WHICH THE STROKE BY A CAP AND MO IS MADE C1 C2 CC VING UP AND DOWN WITH THE BARREL TO WHICH IT IS JOYND AT BOTTOM DDDD INCHES INCHES INCHES LENGTH 30 290 312 DIAMETER  674  635  603 WITHIN THICKNESS  010  008  013 DIAMETER  694  651  629 WITHOUT HERE B B REPRESENTS PART OF THE ELBOW OF FIG 5 OR OF THE FORCING PIPE OF FIG 6 BUT AS THE SPACES BETWEEN THE CYLINDERS ARE SO SMALL AS NOT TO BE VI SIBLE EVEN IN A LARGE DRAUGHT MADE BY A SCALE I HAVE HERE GIVEN THREE MORE DRAUGHTS OF THE THREE CY11 CYLINDERS WHERE THE HEIGHT IS AGREEABLE TO THE SCALE OF THE 7TH FIGURE BUT THE DIAMETERS OF THE MIDDLE AND INNER CYLINDERS ARE MADE LESS THAN THEY ARE IN THE ENGINE TO MAKE THE SPACE BETWEEN WHERE THE MERCURY RISES AND FALLS VISIBLE AND THE CYLINDERS THEMSELVES ARE REPRESENTED BY SINGLE LINES THE QUANTITY OF MERCURY USD IN THIS ENGINE IS 36 12 POUNDS WHICH BEING POURD IN BETWEEN THE OUTER AND INNER CYLINDER RISES UP TO THE HEIGHT OF 16 INCHES WHEN THE BARREL IS PULLD UP AS IN FIG 9 SO AS TO HAVE THE MIDDLE CYLINDER WITHIN AN INCH OF THE BOT TOM OF THE BARREL THE MERCURY ON BOTH SIDES THE MID DLE CYLINDER WILL RISE UP TO THE HEIGHT OF 231 INCHES THAT IS ABOUT TWO INCHES BELOW THE CUP D1 TO THE LINE Q Q WHEN THE BARREL IS GOING DOWN TO FILL THE SUCKING PIPE AND MIDDLE CYLINDER C THE MERCURY IN THE INNER SHELL WILL BE 25 INCHES HIGH AND ONLY 13 IN THE OUTER SHELL FIG 9 WHERE THE SHADED PART REPRESENTS THE  AT THE END OF THE SUCKING STROKE THE MERCURY IS UP TO THE TOP OF THE INNER CYLINDER AND SCARCE AN INCH IN THE OUTER SHELL FIG 8 IN RAISING THE PISTON FROM FORCING TO SUCKING THE FIRST 1 14 INCH DRIVES THE MERCURY OUT OF THE INNER SHELL AND RAISES IT IN THE OUTER SHELL 1328 INCHES THE DEPTH OF AN INCH OF WATER IN THE MIDDLE CY LINDER ABOVE THE INNER ONE OR PLUG IS EQUAL TO A SPACE IN THE OUTER SHELL OF 1328 INCHES AND 14 OF AN INCH IS EQUAL TO THE SAME HEIGHT IN THE INNER SHELL THEREFORE WHEN THE MERCURY IS EQUALLY HIGH IN BOTH SHELLS A MOTION OF 14 OF AN INCH OF THE BAR REL WILL CHARGE FOR SUCTION THAT IS UPON LETTING DOWN THE BARREL ONLY 14 OF AN INCH THE PRESSURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE OUTER SHELL WILL RAISE THE MERCURY IN THE INNER ONE 1328 INCHES AT THE SAME TIME12 TIME THAT IT PUSHES UP THE WATER FROM THE WELL 13 FOOT AND A HALF HIGH INTO THE SUCKING PIPE AND WHEN ALL THE PIPES ARE FULL IF THE MERCURY BE EQUAL LY HIGH IN BOTH SHELLS UPON RAISING THE BARREL ONE INCH THE MERCURY WILL RISE 1328 INCHES IN THE OUTER SHELL WHICH I CALL CHARGING FOR FORCING BECAUSE IN CONTINUING TO RAISE THE BARREL THE FORCING VALVE IM MEDIATELY RISES AND THE WATER COMES OUT AT TOP DURING THE REST OF THE STROKE WHICH IS 12 INCHES AND DELIVERS 16 GALLON OF WATER WINE MEASURE FIG 10 REPRESENTS THE FORCING STROKE HALF WAY UP WITH THE  17 INCHES IN THE OUTER SHELL 4 INCHES IN THE INNER AND THE WHOLE SPACE AT BOTTOM UNDER THE MIDDLE CYLINDER 7 INCHES FROM THIS IT APPEARS THAT IN THE WHOLE STROKE OF 13 INCHES IN LENGTH THERE IS ONLY 14 OF AN INCH LOST TO CHARGE FOR SUCTION AND IN THE NEXT STROKE WHICH IS LIKEWISE OF 13 INCHES THERE IS ONLY ONE INCH LOST TO CHARGE FOR FORCING SO THAT IN A MOTION OF 26 INCHES THERE IS BUT 1 14 INCH OR ABOUT INFERRED120INFERRED PART INEF FECTUAL BUT THIS IS OWING TO THE TOO LARGE SPACE OF THE OUTER SHELL WHICH CONTAINS 4 TIMES MORE THAN THE INNER ONE BECAUSE THE CYLINDERS WERE ONLY HAMMERD AND NOT TURND FOR IF THE OUTER SPACE HAD BEEN NO BIGGER THAN THE INNER THEN 14 OF AN INCH OF THE STROKE WOULD HAVE CHARGD FOR FORCING SO THAT ONLY 13 AN INCH IN 26 OR INFERRED152INFERRED PART OF THE WHOLE STROKE WOULD HAVE BEEN INEFFECTUAL AND IN THAT CASE 25 OF THE QUANTI TY OF MERCURY OR A LITTLE MORE THAN 12 POUNDS WOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT THERE MAY STILL LESS MERCURY BE USD IF THE MID DLE CYLINDER BE MADE OF PLATE IRON TURND ON THE OUTSIDE AND BORD WITHIN THE OUTER CYLINDER BORD AND THE INNER ONE TURND SO THAT IF THE WORK BE WELL PERFORMD EIGHT OR TEN POUNDS OF MERCURY WILL BE13 BE SUFFICIENT IN THIS ENGINE THO THE BORE OF THE MIDDLE CYLINDER OR DIAMETER OF THE PILLAR OF WA TER WHICH IS RAISD BE OF 635 INCHES IF THE BORE OF THE SAID CYLINDER WAS BUT 3 INCHES LESS THAN 3 POUNDS OF MERCURY WOULD SUFFICE AND LESS THAN SIX IF THERE WERE TWO BARRELS IN ORDER TO KEEP A CONSTANT STREAM THRO A PIPE OF ALMOST THE SAME DIAMETER THIS WILL VERY MUCH LESSEN THE EXPENCE OF MERCU RY WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE AN OBJECTION AGAINST THIS ENGINE AND BY MAKING THE INNER AND OUTER CYLINDER OF HARD WOOD AS BOX OR LIGNUM VITAE THE COST OF THE ENGINE MAY STILL BE REDUCD BUT IF THE ENGINE BE VERY LARGE CAST IRON BORD WILL BE PROPER FOR THE OUTER CYLINDER AND CAST IRON TURND ON THE OUT SIDE FOR THE INNER CYLINDER OR PLUG AND HAMMERD IRON BORD AND TURND FOR THE MIDDLE CYLINDER THERE IS AN OBJECTION WHICH SEEMS AT FIRST TO TAKE OFF THE INTENDED ADVANTAGE OF THIS ENGINE WHICH IS THIS VIZ THAT INSTEAD OF THE FRICTION OF THE LEATHER OF A PISTON WHEN WE LIFT UP OUR BARREL TO FORCE THE RESISTANCE THAT THE MERCURY FINDS TO RISE IN THE OUTER SHELL IS AT LEAST AS GREAT AS THE FRICTION THAT WE AVOID NOW THAT RESISTANCE IS NEVER GREATER THAN THE WEIGHT OF A CONCAVE CYLINDER OF MERCURY WHOSE HEIGHT IS THE GREATEST TO WHICH THE MERCURY RISES IN THE SAID SHELL AND THE BASE IS THE AREA OF THE SHELL IT SELF THIS WEIGHT IN OUR ENGINE IS EQUAL TO 575 POUNDS AND THEREFORE ONE WOULD THINK IT GREATER THAN THE RE SISTANCE MADE BY THE FRICTION OF A PISTON BUT IF IT BE CONSIDERD THAT IN THE DESCENT OF THE BARREL FOR SUCKING THE MERCURY SHIFTS IMMEDIATELY INTO THE INNER SHELL RISING TO THE SAME HEIGHT AND STILL KEEPING THE SAME BASE THE AFORESAID WEIGHT OF 575 POUNDS HELPS DOWN THE BARREL AND FACILITATES THE OVERCOMING OF THE FORCE OF THE ATMOSPHERE CONSEQUENTLY THE C WEIGHT14 WEIGHT OF THE MERCURY BEING BALANCD IS NO HINDRANCE WHETHER YOU WORK WITH A SINGLE OR A DOUBLE BARREL THERE REMAINS ONLY THEN THE HINDRANCE BY LOSS OF TIME IN THE BEGINNING OF ANY STROKE BUT I HAVE SHEWD THAT TO BE BUT 152 PART OF THE STROKE I HAVE FOUND THAT THE BEST ENGINES NOW IN USE GENERALLY LOSE NEAR 15 OF THE WATER THAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE ACCORDING TO THEIR NUMBER OF STROKES AND MR HENRY BEIGHTON AN INGENIOUS MEMBER OF THIS SOCIC TY HAVING A GREAT MANY TIMES MEASURD THE WATER THAT IS RAISD BY ENGINES IN MINES FOUND THAT SOME ENGINES LOST 14 AND NONE EVER LOST LESS THAN 15 OF WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF THE STROKES IN THEIR PUMPS WHATEVER AUXILIARY POWERS THEY WERE MOVD WITH THERE IS INDEED ANOTHER OBJECTION BUT SCARCE WORTH NOTICE WHICH IS THAT SOME PARTICLES OF MERCURY WILL MIX WITH THE WATER THAT IS RAISD AND MAKE IT UN WHOLESOME BUT NO BODY THAT CONSIDERS SPECIFICK GRAVITY WILL IMAGINE ANY SUCH THING HOWEVER TO SATISFIE THOSE THAT MIGHT STILL APPREHEND IT IT IS TO BE OBSERVD THAT NONE OF THE WATER THAT IS RAISD COMES NEAR THE MERCURY FOR IN THE CYLINDER C AND PART OF THE ELBOW B FIG 5 THERE IS ALWAYS ABOVE THE MERCURY A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF WATER THAT RISES AND FALLS WITH THE BARREL AND NEVER GOES INTO THE FORCING PIPE THE SAME HAPPENS ALSO IN THE MACHINE OF FIG 6 FOR THE WATER HAVING ONCE RUN INTO THE CY LINDER C ALL THAT IS RAISD AFTERWARDS COMES THRO THE FORCING VALVE WITHOUT COMING DOWN TO THE MER CURY PROVIDED CARE BE TAKEN TO MAKE THE BARREL WITH ITS PLUG TIGHT I DONT SEE THAT THIS MACHINE WILL WANT REPAIR IN A LONG TIME EXCEPT SOME OF THE AUX ILIARY POWERS BE OUT OF ORDER WHICH DO NOT RELATE TO THIS15 THIS INVENTION THE NUMBERS GIVEN WILL SERVE TO EXAMINE THE TRUTH OF WHAT I HAVE ASSERTED CONCERN ING THE MOTION OF THE MERCURY AND FROM THEM ONE MAY MAKE TABLES TO SERVE TO PROPORTION THESE ENGINES FOR RAISING ANY QUANTITY OF WATER TO ANY HEIGHT ACCORDING TO THE POWER ONE HAS TO APPLY III

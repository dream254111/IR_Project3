J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109837,A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS OF THE SATELLITES OF THE GEORGIAN PLANET INCLUDING A PASSAGE THROUGH THE NODE OF THEIR ORBITS WITH AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE TELESCOPIC APPARATUS THAT HAS BEEN USED ON THIS OCCASION AND A FINAL EXPOSITION OF SOME CALCULATED PARTICULARS DEDUCED FROM THE OBSERVATIONS ABSTRACT,I207044,25 ON THE MLLULTIPLICATION OF IMAGES AND THE COLOURS WHICH ACCOMPANY THEM IN SOME SPECIMENS OF CALCAREOUS SPAR BY DAVID BREWSTER LLD F RS LOND AND EDIN IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART GCB PRS READ JUNE 8 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 270 THE PHENOMENA WHICH THE AUTHOR HERE ENDEAVOURS TO EXPLAIN HE SAYS WERE FIRST NOTICED BY PROF ROBINSON OF EDINBURGH AND PUB LISHED BY MR BENJAMIN MARTIN IN HIS TREATISE ON ICELAND CRYSTAL IT WOULD NOT BE EASY TO DESCRIBE THE APPEARANCES WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE FIGURES THAT ACCOMPANY THE PAPER THE PECULIAR SPECIMENS OF CALCAREOUS SPAR IN WHICH THEY OCCUR HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE FISSURES WITH A DISPOSITION TO SPLIT IN THE DIRECTION OF THE LONGER DIA GONAL OF THE RHOMBOID BUT THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS IT AS AN INTERRUPTING STRATUM SINCE IT APPEARS TO HIM NOT TO BEAR THE MOST REMOTE RESEM BLANCE TO A FISSURE BUT RESEMBLES A VEIN OR FILM UNITING THE TWO PRIS MATIC PORTIONS OF A RHOMBOID NEITHER ARE THE PHENOMENA PRODUCED WHEN TWO SURFACES ARTIFICIALLY POLISHED IN THE DIRECTION OF THE SUP POSED PLANE ARE APPLIED TO EACH OTHER BUT THEY ARE PRODUCED WHEN A THIN FILM OF SULPHATE OF LIME IS INTERPOSED AS A VEIN BETWEEN TWO SUCH PORTIONS OF ICELAND SPAR AND THE SURFACES ARE CLOSELY UNITED BY A CEMENT OF STRONG REFRACTIVE POWER THE SUPPOSITION OF SUCH A CRYSTALLIZED VEIN SERVES ALSO TO EXPLAIN THE VARIETIES OBSERVABLE IN THE CHARACTERS OF THE PHENOMENA IN DIF FERENT INSTANCES WHICH MUST VARY ACCORDING TO THE THICKNESS OF THE VEIN AND ACCORDING TO THE POSITION OF ITS POLARIZING AXIS THE AUTHOR ALSO DESCRIBES CERTAIN NEW INSTRUMENTS FOR EXHIBITING COMPLEMENTARY COLOURS PRODUCED BY POLARIZED LIGHT BUT THE DESCRIP TIONS REQUIRE THE AID OF HIS FIGURES TO RENDER THEM INTELLIGIBLE A SERIES OF OBSERVATIONS OF THE SATELLITES OF THE GEORGIAN PLANET IN CLUDING A PASSAGE THROUGH THE NODE OF THEIR ORBITS WITH AN INTRO DUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE TELESCOPIC APPARATUS THAT HAS BEEN USED ON THIS OCCASION AND A FINAL EXPOSITION OF SOME CALCULATED PARTICULARS DEDUCEDFROM THE OBSERVATIONS BYWILLIAM HERSCHEL LLD FRS READ JUNE 8 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 293 SINCE IN THE EXAMINATION OF OBJECTS SO MINUTE AND SO DISTANT AS THESE SATELLITES IT IS NECESSARY NOT ONLY TO MAGNIFY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REMOVING THEM FROM THE BODY OF THE PLANET ITSELF BUT ALSO TO COLLECT AS MUCH OF THEIR LIGHT AS MAY BE IN ORDER TO RENDER THE IMPRESSION THEY MAKE ON THE EYE SENSIBLE NO INSTRUMENT LESS THAN A 20FEET TE LESCOPE IS SUFFICIENT FOR DISCERNING THEM AND EVEN WITH AN INSTRUMENT OF THIS DESCRIPTION IT IS BUT WITH A FAVOURABLE ATMROSPHERE AND THROUGH A SMALL PART OF THEIR ORBIT ROUND THE PRIMARY THAT DR HERSCHEL HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE HIS OBSERVATIONS AND HE HAS ALSO OCCASIONALLY AVAILED HIMSELF OF THE GREATER LIGHT THAT IS TO BE OBTAINED BY CONCAVE EYEGLASSES NOTWITHSTANDING THE SMALLNESS OF THE FIELD OF VIEW AND OTHER OBJECTIONS TO THEIR USE THE MAGNIFYING POWERS EMPLOYED ON26 THESE OCCASIONS HAVE BEEN FROM 300 TO 800 TIMES SOMETIMES ONE AND SOMETIMES ANOTHER BEING USED ACCORDING TO THE STATES OF THE AIR OR MOON OR OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THE OBSERVATIONS HERE RECORDED WERE MADE PRINCIPALLY FROM THE YEAR 1787 TO 1798 INCLUSIVE AND THEY ARE GIVEN IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY OCCURRED WITH ALL THE PHENOMENA NOTICED EACH TIME AND NOTES OF CORRECTION ADDED FROM SUBSEQUENT OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING STARS MISTAKEN FOR SATELLITES OR SATELLITES WRONGLY NUMBERED FOR DR HER SCHEL ALWAYS ADDED A CONFIGURATION TO HIS DESCRIPTIONS IN ORDER TO AVOID MISTAKES AND IN GENERAL MADE BY PREVIOUS ESTIMATE A SKETCH OF THE PLACES WHERE KNOWN SATELLITES MIGHT BE EXPECTED SOME MISCONCEP TIONS WERE UNAVOIDABLE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE INTERRUPTIONS TO HIS OBSERVATIONS FROM CLOUDY OR MOONLIGHT NIGHTS AS WELL AS FROM SMALL STARS THAT UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERED FROM ALL THE OBSERVATIONS THUS MADE AND FROM ACCURATE MEASURES TAKEN BY DIFFERENT MICROMETERS THE AUTHOR INFERS THE NODES OF THE TWO FIRST SATELLITES TO HAVE NEARLY THE SAME LONGITUDE OF 1651 THAT THEIR INCLINATION IS ALSO THE SAME 78 58 AND THE MOTION OF BOTH FROM THEIR ASCENDING NODE TO THE GREATEST ELONGATION RETROGRADE THE PERIODIC TIME OF THE FIRST IS FOUND TO BE 81 161 56 55 AND THAT OF THE SECOND 13D ILH 81 19S THEIR DISTANCES AT GREATEST ELONGATION 36 AND 48 RESPECTIVELY TO THESE DETERMINATIONS RESPECTING THE ORBITS OF THE SATELLITES DR HERSCHEL ADDS HIS ESTIMATE OF THE DISTANCES TO WHICH THEY MUST MOVE FROM THE BODY OF THE PLANET BEFORE THEY BECOME VISIBLE BY HIS 20FEET TELESCOPE THE FIRST REQUIRES TO BE AT MORE THAN HALF ITS GREATEST ELONGATION THE SECOND ALSO BECOMES INVISIBLE WHEN IT IS WITHIN HALF ITS GREATEST ELONGATION IF THERE BE AN INTERIOR SATELLITE AS LARGE AS THE FIRST HE IMAGINES IT WOULD BE VISIBLE THROUGH SO SMALL A PART OF ITS ORBIT AS NOT TO BE SEEN FOR TWO NIGHTS TOGETHER NOTWITHSTANDING THIS DIFFICULTY THE AUTHOR THINKS LIE HAS SEEN AN INTERIOR SATELLITE AND WITH REGARD TO EXTERIOR SATELLITES THOUGH NOTHING HAS BEEN CORRECTLY ASCERTAINED THE NUMBER AND POSITIONS OF DIFFERENT OBJECTS RECORDED IS SUCH THAT THE AUTHOR ENUMERATES AS FAR AS A SUPPOSED SIXTH SATELLITE AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS WITH A LARGE VOLTAIC BATTERY BY J G CHILDREN ESQ FRS READ JUNE 15 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 363 THE BATTERY WITH WHICH THESE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE HAS 21 CELLS EACH CONTAINING ABOUT 40 GALLONS OF WATER TO WHICH WAS ADDED A MIXTURE OF NITRIC AND SULPHURIC ACIDS AT VARIOUS INTERVALS BEGINNING WITH TH AND ENDING WITH I TH PART OF THE WATER INTO EACH CELL WAS IMMERSED A ZINC PLATE WITH A PAIR OF COPPER PLATES ONE ON EACH SIDE BUT CONNECTED TOGETHER AT THE BOTTOM AND ALSO DULY CONNECTED TO THE ZINC IN THE CELL ADJACENT EACH PLATE HAD 16 SQUARE FEET OF SURFACE THE FIRST SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS WERE ON THE COMPARATIVE LIABILITY OF

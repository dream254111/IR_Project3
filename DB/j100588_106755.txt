J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106755,ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL ESQ F R S,I206942,213 XII ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL ESQ F R S READ FEBRUARY 3 1785 THE SUBJECT OF THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS ON WHICH I HAVE SO LATELY VENTURED TO DELIVER MY THOUGHTS TO THIS SOCIETY IS OF SO EXTENSIVE AND IMPORTANT A NATURE THAT WE CANNOT EXERT TOO MUCH ATTENTION IN OUR ENDEAVOURS TO THROW ALL POSSIBLE LIGHT UPON IT I SHALL THEREFORE NOW ATTEMPT TO PURSUE THE DELINEATIONS OF WHICH A FAINT OUTLINE WAS BEGUN IN MY FORMER PAPER BY CONTINUING TO OBSERVE THE HEAVENS WITH MY LAST CON STRUCTED AND SINCE THAT TIME MUCH IMPROVED INSTRUMENT I AM NOW ENABLED TO BRING MORE CONFIRMATION TO SEVERAL PARTS THAT WERE BEFORE BUT WEAKLY SUPPORTED AND ALSO TO OFFER A FEW STILL FURTHER EXTENDED HINTS SUCH AS THEY PRESENT THEMSELVES TO MY PRESENT VIEW BUT FIRST LET ME MENTION THAT IF WE WOULD HOPE TO MAKE ANY PROGRESS IN AN INVESTIGATION OF THIS DELICATE NATURE WE OUGHT TO AVOID TWO OPPOSITE EXTREMES OF WHICH I CAN HARDLY SAY WHICH IS THE MOST DANGEROUS IF WE INDULGE A FANCIFUL IMAGINATION AND BUILD WORLDS OF OUR OWN WE MUST NOT WONDER AT OUR GOING WIDE FROM THE PATH OF TRUTH AND NATURE BUT THESE WILL VANISH LIKE THE CARTESIAN VORTICES THAT SOON GAVE WAY WHEN BETTER THEORIES WERE OFFERED ON THE OTHER HAND IF WE ADD OBSERVATION TO OBSERVATION WITHOUT ATTEMPT ING TO DRAW NOT ONLY CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS BUT ALSO CONJECTURAL VIEWS214 MR HERSCHEL ON THE VIEWS FROM THEM WE OFFEND AGAINST THE VERY END FOR WHICH ONLY OBSERVATIONS OUGHT TO BE MADE I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO KEEP A PROPER MEDIUM BUT IF I SHOULD DEVIATE FROM THAT I COULD WISH NOT TO FALL INTO THE LATTER ERROR THAT THE MILKY WAY IS A MOST EXTENSIVE STRATUM OF STARS OF VARIOUS SIZES ADMITS NO LONGER OF THE LEAST DOUBT AND THAT OUR SUN IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES BELONGING TO IT IS AS EVIDENT I HAVE NOW VIEWED AND GAGED THIS SHINING ZONE IN ALMOST EVERY DIRECTION AND FIND IT COMPOSED OF STARS WHOSE NUMBER BY THE ACCOUNT OF THESE GAGES CONSTANTLY INCREASES AND DECREASES IN PROPORTION TO ITS APPARENT BRIGHTNESS TO THE NAKED EYE BUT IN ORDER TO DEVELOP THE IDEAS OF THE UNIVERSE THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED BY MY LATE OBSERVATIONS IT WILL BE BEST TO TAKE THE SUBJECT FROM A POINT OF VIEW AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE BOTH OF SPACE AND OF TIME THEORETICAL VIEW LET US THEN SUPPOSE NUMBERLESS STARS OF VARIOUS SIZES SCAT TERED OVER AN INDEFINITE PORTION OF SPACE IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE ALMOST EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE THE LAWS OF ATTRACTION WHICH NO DOUBT EXTEND TO THE REMOTEST REGIONS OF THE FIXED STARS WILL OPERATE IN SUCH A MANNER AS MOST PROBABLY TO PRODUCE THE FOLLOWING REMARKABLE EFFECTS FORMATION OF NEBULAE FROM I IN THE FIRST PLACE SINCE WE HAVE SUPPOSED THE STARS TO BE OF VARIOUS SIZES IT WILL FREQUENTLY HAPPEN THAT A STAR BEING CONSIDERABLY LARGER THAN ITS NEIGHBOURING ONES WILL ATTRACT THEM MORE THAN THEY WILL BE ATTRACTED BY OTHERS THAT ARE IMMEDIATELYCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 215 IMMEDIATELY AROUND THEM BY WHICH MEANS THEY WILL BE IN TIME AS IT WERE CONDENSED ABOUT A CENTER OR IN OTHER WORDS FORM THEMSELVES INTO A CLUSTER OF STARS OF ALMOST A GLOBULAR FIGURE MORE OR LESS REGULARLY SO ACCORDING TO THE SIZE AND ORIGINAL DISTANCE OF THE SURROUNDING STARS THE PERTURBATIONS OF THESE MUTUAL ATTRACTIONS MUST UNDOUBTEDLY BE VERY INTRICATE AS WE MAY EASILY COMPREHEND BY CONSIDERING WHAT SIR ISAAC NEWTON SAYS IN THE FIRST BOOK OF HIS PRINCIPIA IN THE 38TH AND FOLLOWING PROBLEMS BUT IN ORDER TO APPLY THIS GREAT AUTHORS REASONING OF BODIES MOVING IN ELLIPSES TO SUCH AS ARE HERE FOR A WHILE SUPPOSED TO HAVE NO OTHER MOTION THAN WHAT THEIR MUTUAL GRAVITY HAS IMPARTED TO THEM WE MUST SUPPOSE THE CONJUGATE AXES OF THESE ELLIPSES INDEFINITELY DIMINISHED WHEREBY THE ELLIPSES WILL BECOME STRAIGHT LINES FORM II THE NEXT CASE WHICH WILL ALSO HAPPEN ALMOST AS FREQUENTLY AS THE FORMER IS WHERE A FEW STARS THOUGH NOT SUPERIOR IN SIZE TO THE REST MAY CHANCE TO BE RATHER NEARER EACH OTHER THAN THE SURROUNDING ONES FOR HERE ALSO WILL BE FORMED A PREVAILING ATTRACTION IN THE COMBINED CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THEM ALL WHICH WILL OCCASION THE NEIGHBOURING STARS TO DRAW TOGE THER NOT INDEED SO AS TO FORM A REGULAR OR GLOBULAR FIGURE BUT HOWEVER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO BE CONDENSED TOWARDS THE COMMON CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE WHOLE IRREGULAR CLUSTER AND THIS CONSTRUCTION ADMITS OF THE UTMOST VARIETY OF SHAPES AC CORDING TO THE NUMBER AND SITUATION OF THE STARS WHICH FIRST GAVE RISE TO THE CONDENSATION OF THE REST FORM III FROM THE COMPOSITION AND REPEATED CONJUNCTION OF BOTH THE FOREGOING FORMS A THIRD MAY BE DERIVED WHEN MANY LARGE STARS OR COMBINED SMALL ONES ARE SITUATED IN LONG EX TENDED REGULAR OR CROOKED ROWS HOOKS OR BRANCHES FOR THEY WILL ALSO DRAW THE SURROUNDING ONES SO AS TO PRODUCE FIGURES OF216 MR HERSCHEL ON THE OF CONDENSED STARS COARSELY SIMILAR TO THE FORMER WHICH GAVE RISE TO THESE CONDENSATIONS FORM IV WE MAY LIKEWISE ADMIT OF STILL MORE EXTENSIVE COMBINATIONS WHEN AT THE SAME TIME THAT A CLUSTER OF STARS IS FORMING IN ONE PART OF SPACE THERE MAY BE ANOTHER COLLECT ING IN A DIFFERENT BUT PERHAPS NOT FAR DISTANT QUARTER WHICH MAY OCCASION A MUTUAL APPROACH TOWARDS THEIR COMMON CENTER OF GRAVITY V IN THE LAST PLACE AS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMER CASES THERE WILL BE FORMED GREAT CAVITIES OR VACANCIES BY THE RETREAT OF THE STARS TOWARDS THE VARIOUS CENTERS WHICH ATTRACT THEM SO THAT UPON THE WHOLE THERE IS EVIDENTLY A FIELD OF THE GREATEST VARIETY FOR THE MUTUAL AND COMBINED ATTRACTIONS OF THE HEAVENLY BODIES TO EXERT THEMSELVES IN I SHALL THERE FORE WITHOUT EXTENDING MYSELF FARTHER UPON THIS SUBJECT PRO CEED TO A FEW CONSIDERATIONS THAT WILL NATURALLY OCCUR TO EVERY ONE WHO MAY VIEW THIS SUBJECT IN THE LIGHT I HAVE HERE DONE OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED AT FIRST SIGHT THEN IT WILL SEEM AS IF A SYSTEM SUCH AS IT HAS BEEN DISPLAYED IN THE FOREGOING PARAGRAPHS WOULD EVIDENTLY TEND TO A GENERAL DESTRUCTION BY THE SHOCK OF ONE STARS FALLING UPON ANOTHER IT WOULD HERE BE A SUFFICIENT ANSWER TO SAY THAT IF OBSERVATION SHOULD PROVE THIS REALLY TO BE THE SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSE THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT THE GREAT AUTHOR OF IT HAS AMPLY PROVIDED FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THE WHOLE THOUGH IT SHOULD NOT APPEAR TO US IN WHAT MANNER THIS IS EFFECTED BUT I SHALL MOREOVER POINT OUT SEVERAL CIRCUM STANCES THAT DO MANIFESTLY TEND TO A GENERAL PRESERVATION AS IN THE FIRST PLACE THE INDEFINITE EXTENT OF THE SIDEREAL HEAVENS 6 WHICHCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 217 WHICH MUST PRODUCE A BALANCE THAT WILL EFFECTUALLY SECURE ALL THE GREAT PARTS OF THE WHOLE FROM APPROACHING TO EACH OTHER THERE REMAINS THEN ONLY TO SEE HOW THE PARTICULAR STARS BE LONGING TO SEPARATE CLUSTERS WILL BE PRESERVED FROM RUSHING ON TO THEIR CENTERS OF ATTRACTION AND HERE I MUST OBSERVE THAT THOUGH I HAVE BEFORE BY WAY OF RENDERING THE CASE MORE SIM PLE CONSIDERED THE STARS AS BEING ORIGINALLY AT REST I INTENDED NOT TO EXCLUDE PROJECTILE FORCES AND THE ADMISSION OF THEM WILL PROVE SUCH A BARRIER AGAINST THE SEEMING DESTRUCTIVE POWER OF ATTRACTION AS TO SECURE FROM IT ALL THE STARS BELONGING TO A CLUSTER IF NOT FOR EVER AT LEAST FOR MILLIONS OF AGES BESIDES WE OUGHT PERHAPS TO LOOK UPON SUCH CLUSTERS AND THE DESTRUC TION OF NOW AND THEN A STAR IN SOME THOUSANDS OF AGES AS PERHAPS THE VERY MEANS BY WHICH THE WHOLE IS PRESERVED AND RENEWED THESE CLUSTERS MAY BE THE LABORATORIES OF THE UNIVERSE IF I MAY SO EXPRESS MYSELF WHEREIN THE MOST SALUTARY REMEDIES FOR THE DECAY OF THE WHOLE ARE PREPARED OPTICAL APPEARANCES FROM THIS THEORETICAL VIEW OF THE HEAVENS WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN AS WE OBSERVED FROM A POINT NOT LESS DISTANT IN TIME THAN IN SPACE WE WILL NOW RETREAT TO OUR OWN RETIRED STATION IN ONE OF THE PLANETS ATTENDING A STAR IN ITS GREAT COMBINATION WITH NUMBERLESS OTHERS AND IN ORDER TO INVESTIGATE WHAT WILL BE THE APPEARANCES FROM THIS CONTRACTED SITUATION LET US BEGIN WITH THE NAKED EYE THE STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE BEING IN ALL PROBABILITY THE NEAREST WILL FURNISH US WITH A STEP TO BEGIN OUR SCALE SETTING OFF THEREFORE WITH THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS OR ARCTURUS FOR INSTANCE AS UNITY WE WILL AT PRESENT SUPPOSE THAT THOSE OF THE SECOND MAGNITUDE ARE AT DOUBLE AND VOL LXXV F F THOSE218 MR HERSCHEL ON THE THOSE OF THE THIRD AT TREBLE THE DISTANCE AND SO FORTH IT IS NOT NECESSARY CRITICALLY TO EXAMINE WHAT QUANTITY OF LIGHT OR MAG NITUDE OF A STAR INTITLES IT TO BE ESTIMATED OF SUCH OR SUCH A PRO PORTIONAL DISTANCE AS THE COMMON COARSE ESTIMATION WILL ANSWER OUR PRESENT PURPOSE AS WELL TAKING IT THEN FOR GRANTED THAT A STAR OF THE SEVENTH MAGNITUDE IS ABOUT SEVEN TIMES AS FAR AS ONE OF THE FIRST IT FOLLOWS THAT AN OBSERVER WHO IS INCLOSED IN A GLOBULAR CLUSTER OF STARS AND NOT FAR FROM THE CENTER WILL NEVER BE ABLE WITH THE NAKED EYE TO SEE TO THE END OF IT FOR SINCE ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE ESTIMATIONS HE CAN ONLY EXTEND HIS VIEW TO ABOUT SEVEN TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT HIS EYES SHOULD REACH THE BORDERS OF A CLUSTER WHICH HAS PERHAPS NOT LESS THAN FIFTY STARS IN DEPTH EVERY WHERE AROUND HIM THE WHOLE UNIVERSE THEREFORE TO HIM WILL BE COMPRISED IN A SET OF CONSTELLATIONS RICHLY ORNAMENTED WITH SCATTERED STARS OF ALL SIZES OR IF THE UNITED BRIGHTNESS OF A NEIGHBOURING CLUSTER OF STARS SHOULD IN A REMARKABLE CLEAR NIGHT REACH HIS SIGHT IT WILL PUT ON THE APPEARANCE OF A SMALL FAINT WHITISH NEBULOUS CLOUD NOT TO BE PERCEIVED WITHOUT THE GREATEST ATTENTION TO PASS BY OTHER SITUATIONS LET HIM BE PLACED IN A MUCH EXTENDED STRATUM OR BRANCHING CLUSTER OF MILLIONS OF STARS SUCH AS MAY FALL UNDER THE IIID FORM OF NE BULAE CONSIDERED IN A FOREGOING PARAGRAPH HERE ALSO THE HEA VENS WILL NOT ONLY BE RICHLY SCATTERED OVER WITH BRILLIANT CON STELLATIONS BUT A SHINING ZONE OR MILKY WAY WILL BE PERCEIVED TO SURROUND THE WHOLE SPHERE OF THE HEAVENS OWING TO THE COMBINED LIGHT OF THOSE STARS WHICH ARE TOO SMALL THAT IS TOO REMOTE TO BE SEEN OUR OBSERVERS SIGHT WILL BE SO CONFINED THAT HE WILL IMAGINE THIS SINGLE COLLECTION OF STARS OF WHICH HE DOES NOT EVEN PERCEIVE THE THOUSANDTH PART TO BE THE WHOLE CONTENTS OF THE HEAVENS ALLOWING HIM NOW THE USE OF A 4 COMMONCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 219 COMMON TELESCOPE HE BEGINS TO SUSPECT THAT ALL THE MILKINESS OF THE BRIGHT PATH WHICH SURROUNDS THE SPHERE MAY BE OWING TO STARS HE PERCEIVES A FEW CLUSTERS OF THEM IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE HEAVENS AND FINDS ALSO THAT THERE ARE A KIND OF NEBU LOUS PATCHES BUT STILL HIS VIEWS ARE NOT EXTENDED SO FAR AS TO REACH TO THE END OF THE STRATUM IN WHICH HE IS SITUATED SO THAT HE LOOKS UPON THESE PATCHES AS BELONGING TO THAT SYSTEM WHICH TO HIM SEEMS TO COMPREHEND EVERY CELESTIAL OBJECT HE NOW INCREASES HIS POWER OF VISION AND APPLYING HIMSELF TO A CLOSE OBSERVATION FINDS THAT THE MILKY WAY IS INDEED NO OTHER THAN A COLLECTION OF VERY SMALL STARS HE PERCEIVES THAT THOSE OBJECTS WHICH HAD BEEN CALLED NEBULAE ARE EVIDENTLY NOTHING BUT CLUSTERS OF STARS HE FINDS THEIR NUMBER INCREASE UPON HIM AND WHEN HE RESOLVES ONE NEBULA INTO STARS HE DISCOVERS TEN NEW ONES WHICH HE CANNOT RESOLVE HE THEN FORMS THE IDEA OF IMMENSE STRATA OF FIXED STARS OF CLUSTERS OF STARS AND OF NEBULAE A TILL GOING ON WITH SUCH INTERESTING OBSERVATIONS HE NOW PERCEIVES THAT ALL THESE APPEARANCES MUST NATURALLY ARISE FROM THE CON FINED SITUATION IN WHICH WE ARE PLACED CONFINED IT MAY JUSTLY BE CALLED THOUGH IN NO LESS A SPACE THAN WHAT BEFORE APPEARED TO BE THE WHOLE REGION OF THE FIXED STARS BUT WHICH NOW HAS ASSUMED THE SHAPE OF A CROOKEDLY BRANCHING NEBULA NOT IN DEED ONE OF THE LEAST BUT PERHAPS VERY FAR FROM BEING THE MOST CONSIDERABLE OF THOSE NUMBERLESS CLUSTERS THAT ENTER INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS RESULT OF OBSERVATIONS I SHALL NOW ENDEAVOUR TO SHEW THAT THE THEORETICAL VIEW OF THE SYSTEM OF THE UNIVERSE WHICH HAS BEEN EXPOSED IN THE A SEE A FORMER PAPER ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS F F 2 FORE220 MR HERSCHEL ON THE FOREGOING PART OF THIS PAPER IS PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH FACTS AND SEEMS TO BE CONFIRMED AND ESTABLISHED BY A SERIES OF OBSER VATIONS IT WILL APPEAR THAT MANY HUNDREDS OF NEBULAE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND FORMS ARE ACTUALLY TO BE SEEN IN THE HEAVENS AND THEIR PLACES WILL HEREAFTER BE POINTED OUT MANY OF THE THIRD FORM WILL BE DESCRIBED AND INSTANCES OF THE FOURTH RE LATED A FEW OF THE CAVITIES MENTIONED IN THE FIFTH WILL BE PARTICULARISED THOUGH MANY MORE HAVE ALREADY BEEN OBSERVED SO THAT UPON THE WHOLE I BELIEVE IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE FOREGOING THEORETICAL VIEW WITH ALL ITS CONSEQUENTIAL APPEAR ANCES AS SEEN BY AN EYE INCLOSED IN ONE OF THE NEBULAE IS NO OTHER THAN A DRAWING FROM NATURE WHEREIN THE FEATURES OF THE ORIGINAL HAVE BEEN CLOSELY COPIED AND I HOPE THE RESEMBLANCE WILL NOT BE CALLED A BAD ONE WHEN IT SHALL BE CONSIDERED HOW VERY LIMITED MUST BE THE PENCIL OF AN INHABITANT OF SO SMALL AND RETIRED A PORTION OF AN INDEFINITE SYSTEM IN ATTEMPTING THE PICTURE OF SO UNBOUNDED AN EXTENT BUT TO PROCEED TO PARTICULARS I SHALL BEGIN BY GIVING THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF GAGES THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN THE FIRST COLUMN IS THE RIGHT ASCENSION AND IN THE SECOND THE NORTH POLAR DISTANCE BOTH REDUCED TO THE TIME OF FLAMSTEEDS CATALOGUE IN THE THIRD ARE THE CONTENTS OF THE HEAVENS BEING THE RESULT OF THE GAGES THE FOURTH SHEWS FROM HOW MANY FIELDS OF VIEW THE GAGES WERE DEDUCED WHICH HAVE BEEN TEN OR MORE WHERE THE NUMBER OF THE STARS WAS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE BUT AS IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN TOO MUCH TIME IN HIGH NUMBERS TO COUNT SO MANY FIELDS THE GAGES ARE GENERALLY SINGLE WHERE THE STARS HAPPENED TO BE UNCOMMONLY CROUDED NO MORE THAN HALF A FIELD WAS COUNTED AND EVEN SOMETIMES ONLY A QUADRANT BUT THEN IT WAS ALWAYS DONE WITH THE PRECAUTION OF FIXING ON SOME ROW OF STARS THAT WOULD POINT OUT THE DIVISION OF THE FIELD SOCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 221 SO AS TO PREVENT ANY CONSIDERABLE MISTAKE WHEN FIVE TEN OR MORE FIELDS ARE GAGED THE POLAR DISTANCE IN THE SECOND COLUMN OF THE TABLE IS THAT OF THE MIDDLE OF THE SWEEP WHICH WAS GENERALLY FROM 2 TO 212 DEGREES IN BREADTH AND IN GAGING A REGULAR DISTRIBUTION OF

BETWEEN THE STARS CONTAINED IN THE SMALL AND THE GREAT CONE AND THAT CONSEQUENTLY THE SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM WHERE WE SUPPOSE THE STARS OF ONE CONE TO BE TO THOSE OF THE OTHER IN THE RATIO OF THE SOLIDITY ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING EQUALLY SCATTERED WILL NOT BE STRICTLY TRUE BUT IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT IN SMALL NUMBERS WHERE THE DIFFERENT TERMINATIONS OF THE FIELDS WOULD MOST AFFECT THIS SOLUTION THE STARS IN VIEW HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ASCERTAINED FROM GAGES THAT WERE OFTEN REPEATED AND EACH OF WHICH CONSISTED OF NO LESS THAN TEN FIELDS SUCCESSIVELY TAKEN SO THAT THE DIFFERENT DEVIATIONS AT THE PERIPHERY AND BASE OF THE CONE WOULD CERTAINLY COMPENSATE EACH OTHER SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CALCULATION AND THAT ON THE OTHER HAND IN HIGH GAGES WHICH COULD NOT HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF BEING SO OFTEN REPEATED THESE DEVIATIONS WOULD BEAR A MUCH SMALLER PROPORTION TO THE GREAT NUMBER OF STARS IN A FIELD OF VIEW AND THEREFORE ON THIS ACCOUNT SUCH GAGES MAY VERY JUSTLY BE ADMITTED IN A SOLUTION WHERE PRACTICAL TRUTH RATHER THAN MATHEMATICAL PRECISION IS THE END WE HAVE IN VIEW IT IS MOREOVER NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT WE IMAGINE THE STARS TO BE ACTUALLY ARRANGED IN THIS REGULAR MANNER AND RETURNING THEREFORE TO OUR GENERAL HYPOTHESIS OF THEIR BEING EQUALLY SCATTERED ANY ONE FIELD OF VIEW PROMISCUOUSLY TAKEN MAY IN THIS GENERAL SENSE BE SUPPOSED TO CONTAIN A DUE PROPORTION OF

COLLECTIVELY THERE WILL BE A MEAN DISTANCE WHICH MAY BE ASSUMED AS THE GENERAL ONE AND AN ARGUMENT FOUNDED ON SUCH A SUPPOSITION WILL HAVE IN ITS FAVOUR THE GREATEST PROBABILITY OF NOT BEING FAR SHORT OF TRUTH WHAT WILL RENDER THE SUPPOSITION OF AN EQUAL DISTRIBU TION OF THE STARS WITH REGARD TO THE GAGES STILL LESS EXPOSED TO OBJECTIONS IS THAT WHENEVER THE STARS HAPPENED EITHER TO BE UNCOMMONLY CROWDED OR DEFICIENT IN NUMBER SO AS VERY SUD E THE BREADTH OF MY SWEEP WAS 2 26 TO WHICH MUST BE ADDED 15 FOR TWO SEMIDIAMETERS OF THE FIELD THEN PUTTING 161  A THE NUMBER OF FIELDS IN 15 MINUTES OF

TERMS AND THE USE OF SUCH GAGES I SHALL HEREAFTER FIND AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXPLAINING AND NONE OF THOSE KINDS OF GAGES HAVE BEEN ADMITTED IN THIS TABLE WHICH CONSISTS ONLY OF SUCH AS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IN PLACES WHERE THE STARS APPARENTLY SEEMED TO BE IN GENERAL PRETTY EVENLY SCAT TERED AND TO INCREASE AND DECREASE IN NUMBER BY A CERTAIN GRA DUAL PROGRESSION NOR HAS ANY PART OF THE HEAVENS CONTAINING A CLUSTER OF STARS BEEN PUT IN THE GAGES AND HERE I MUST OB SERVE THAT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A CROWDED PLACE AND A CLUSTER MAY EASILY BE PERCEIVED BY THE ARRANGEMENT AS WELL AS THE SIZE AND MUTUAL DISTANCE OF THE STARS FOR IN A CLUSTER THEY ARE GENERALLY NOT ONLY RESEMBLING EACH OTHER PRETTY NEARLY IN SIZE BUT A CERTAIN UNIFORMITY OF DISTANCE ALSO TAKES PLACE THEY ARE MORE AND MORE ACCUMULATED TOWARDS THE CENTER AND PUT ON ALL THE APPEARANCES WHICH WE SHOULD NATURALLY EXPECT FROM A NUM BER OF THEM COLLECTED INTO A GROUP AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM US ON THE OTHER HAND THE RICH PARTS OF THE MILKY WAY AS WELL AS THOSE IN THE DISTANT BROAD PART OF THE STRATUM CONSIST OF A MIXTURE OF STARS OF ALL POSSIBLE SIZES THAT ARE SEEMINGLY PLACED WITHOUT ANY PARTICULAR APPARENT ORDER PERHAPS WE MIGHT RECOLLECT THAT A GREATER CONDENSATION TOWARDS THE CENTER OF OUR SYSTEM THAN TOWARDS THE BORDERS OF IT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CON SIDERATION BUT WITH A NEBULA OF THE THIRD FORM CONTAINING SUCH VARIOUS AND EXTENSIVE COMBINATIONS AS I HAVE FOUND TO TAKE PLACE IN OURS THIS CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IN ONE OF THE FIRST FORM WOULD BE OF CONSIDERABLE MOMENT MAY I THINK BE SAFELY NEGLECTED HOWEVER I WOULD NOT BE UNDERSTOOD TO LAY A GREATER STRESS ON THESE AND THE FOLLOWING CALCULATIONS THAN THE PRINCIPLES ON WHICH THEY ARE FOUNDED WILL PERMIT AND IF HERE AFTERCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 247 AFTER WE SHALL FIND REASON FROM EXPERIENCE AND OBSERVATION TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR SYSTEM WHERE THE STARS ARE NOT SCATTERED IN THE MANNER HERE SUPPOSED WE OUGHT THEN TO MAKE PROPER EXCEPTIONS BUT TO RETURN IF SOME OTHER HIGH GAGE BE SELECTED FROM THE TABLE SUCH AS 472 OR 344 THE LENGTH OF THE VISUAL RAY WILL BE FOUND 461 AND 415 AND ALTHOUGH IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHAT HAS BEEN SAID A CERTAIN DEGREE OF DOUBT MAY BE LEFT ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT AND SCATTERING OF THE STARS YET WHEN I RECOLLECT THAT IN THOSE PARTS OF THE MILKY WAY WHERE THESE HIGH GAGES WERE TAKEN THE STARS WERE NEITHER SO SMALL NOR SO CROWDED AS THEY MUST HAVE BEEN ON A SUPPOSITION OF A MUCH FAR THER CONTINUANCE OF THEM WHEN CERTAINLY A MILKY OR NE BULOUS APPEARANCE MUST HAVE COME ON I NEED NOT FEAR TO HAVE OVERRATED THE EXTENT OF MY VISUAL RAY AND INDEED EVERY THING THAT CAN BE SAID TO SHORTEN IT WILL ONLY CONTRACT THE LIMITS OF OUR NEBULA AS IT HAS IN MOST PLACES BEEN OF SUFFICIENT LENGTH TO GO FAR BEYOND THE BOUNDS OF IT THUS IN THE SIDES OF THE STRATUM OPPOSITE TO OUR SITUATION IN IT WHERE THE GAGES OFTEN RUN BELOW 5 OUR NEBULA CANNOT EXTEND TO 100 TIMES THE DIS TANCE OF SIRIUS AND THE SAME TELESCOPE WHICH COULD SHEW 588 STARS IN A FIELD OF VIEW OF 15 MINUTES MUST CERTAINLY HAVE PRE SENTED ME ALSO WITH THE STARS IN THESE SITUATIONS AS WELL AS THE FORMER HAD THEY BEEN THERE IF WE SHOULD ANSWER THIS BY OB SERVING THAT THEY MIGHT BE AT TOO GREAT A DISTANCE TO BE PER CEIVED IT WILL BE ALLOWING THAT THERE MUST AT LEAST BE A VACANCY AMOUNTING TO THE LENGTH OF A VISUAL RAY NOT SHORT OF 400 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS AND THIS IS AMPLY SUFFICIENT TO MAKE OUR NEBULA A DETACHED ONE IT IS TRUE THAT IT WOULD NOT BE CON SISTENT CONFIDENTLY TO AFFIRM THAT WE WERE ON AN ISLAND UNLESS WE HAD ACTUALLY FOUND OURSELVES EVERY WHERE BOUNDED BY THE OCEAN 5248 MR HERSCHEL ON THE OCEAN AND THEREFORE I SHALL GO NO FARTHER THAN THE GAGES WILL AUTHORISE BUT CONSIDERING THE LITTLE DEPTH OF THE STRATUM IN ALL THOSE PLACES WHICH HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY GAGED TO WHICH MUST BE ADDED ALL THE INTERMEDIATE PARTS THAT HAVE BEEN VIEWED AND FOUND TO BE MUCH LIKE THE REST THERE IS BUT LITTLE ROOM TO EXPECT A CONNECTION BETWEEN OUR NEBULA AND ANY OF THE NEIGHBOURING ONES I OUGHT ALSO TO ADD THAT A TELESCOPE WITH A MUCH LARGER APERTURE THAN MY PRESENT ONE GRASPING TOGETHER A GREATER QUAN TITY OF LIGHT AND THEREBY ENABLING US TO SEE FARTHER INTO SPACE WILL BE THE SUREST MEANS OF COMPLEATING AND ESTABLISHING THE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED FOR IF OUR NEBULA IS NOT ABSO LUTELY A DETACHED ONE I AM FIRMLY PERSUADED THAT AN INSTRU MENT MAY BE MADE LARGE ENOUGH TO DISCOVER THE PLACES WHERE THE STARS CONTINUE ONWARDS A VERY BRIGHT MILKY NEBULOSITY MUST THERE UNDOUBTEDLY COME ON SINCE THE STARS IN A FIELD OF VIEW WILL INCREASE IN THE RATIO OF N3 GREATER THAN THAT OF THE CUBE OF THE VISUAL RAY THUS IF 588 STARS IN A GIVEN FIELD OF VIEW ARE TO BE SEEN BY A RAY OF 497 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS WHEN THIS IS LENGTHENED TO 1000 WHICH IS BUT LITTLE MORE THAN DOUBLE THE FORMER THE NUMBER OF STARS IN THE SAME FIELD OF VIEW WILL BE NO LESS THAN 4774 FOR WHEN THE VISUAL RAY R IS GIVEN THE NUMBER S OF STARS WILL BE  N3B2 WHERE N  R  1 AND A TELESCOPE WITH A THREEFOLD POWER OF EXTENDING INTO SPACE OR WITH A RAY OF 1500 WHICH I THINK MAY EASILY BE CON STRUCTED WILL GIVE US 16096 STARS NOW THESE WOULD NOT BE SO CLOSE BUT THAT A GOOD POWER APPLIED TO SUCH AN INSTRUMENT MIGHT EASILY DISTINGUISH THEM FOR THEY NEED NOT IF ARRANGED IN REGULAR SQUARES APPROACH NEARER TO EACH OTHER THAN 6 27 BUT WHAT WOULD PRODUCE THE MILKY NEBULOSITY WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED IS THE NUMBERLESS STARS BEYOND THEM WHICH IN ONE RESPECTCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 249 RESPECT THE VISUAL RAY MIGHT ALSO BE SAID TO REACH TO MAKE THIS APPEAR WE MUST RETURN TO THE NAKED EYE WHICH AS WE HAVE BEFORE ESTIMATED CAN ONLY SEE THE STARS OF THE SEVENTH MAGNITUDE SO AS TO DISTINGUISH THEM BUT IT IS NEVERTHELESS VERY EVIDENT THAT THE UNITED LUSTRE OF MILLIONS OF STARS SUCH AS I SUPPOSE THE NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA TO BE WILL REACH OUR SIGHT IN THE SHAPE OF A VERY SMALL FAINT NEBULOSITY SINCE THE NEBULA OF WHICH I SPEAK MAY EASILY BE SEEN IN A FINE EVENING IN THE SAME MANNER MY PRESENT TELESCOPE AS I HAVE ARGUED HAS NOT ONLY A VISUAL RAY THAT WILL REACH THE STARS AT 497 TIMES THE DIS TANCE OF SIRIUS SO AS TO DISTINGUISH THEM AND PROBABLY MUCH FARTHER BUT ALSO A POWER OF SHEWING THE UNITED LUSTRE OF THE ACCUMULATED STARS THAT COMPOSE A MILKY NEBULOSITY AT A DISTANCE FAR EXCEEDING THE FORMER LIMITS SO THAT FROM THESE CONSIDERA TIONS IT APPEARS AGAIN HIGHLY PROBABLE THAT MY PRESENT TELESCOPE NOT SHEWING SUCH A NEBULOSITY IN THE MILKY WAY GOES ALREADY FAR BEYOND ITS EXTENT AND CONSEQUENTLY MUCH MORE WOULD AN INSTRUMENT SUCH AS I HAVE MENTIONED REMOVE ALL DOUBT ON THE SUBJECT BOTH BY SHEWING THE STARS IN THE CONTINUATION OF THE STRATUM AND BY EXPOSING A VERY STRONG MILKY NEBULOSITY BEYOND THEM THAT COULD NO LONGER BE MISTAKEN FOR THE DARK GROUND OF THE HEAVENS TO THESE ARGUMENTS WHICH REST ON THE FIRM BASIS OF A SERIES OF OBSERVATION WE MAY ADD THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS DRAWN FROM ANALOGY AMONG THE GREAT NUMBER OF NEBULAE WHICH I HAVE NOW ALREADY SEEN AMOUNTING TO MORE THAN 900 THERE ARE MANY WHICH IN ALL PROBABILITY ARE EQUALLY EXTENSIVE WITH THAT WHICH WE INHABIT AND YET THEY ARE ALL SEPARATED FROM EACH OTHER BY VERY CONSIDERABLE INTERVALS SOME INDEED THERE ARE THAT SEEM TO BE DOUBLE AND TREBLE AND THOUGH WITH MOST OF THESE IT MAY BE THAT THEY ARE AT A VERY GREAT DISTANCE FROM EACH VOL LXXV K K OTHER250 MR HERSCHEL ON THE OTHER YET WE ALLOW THAT SOME SUCH CONJUNCTIONS REALLY ARE TO BE FOUND NOR IS THIS WHAT WE MEAN TO EXCLUDE BUT THEN THESE COMPOUND OR DOUBLE NEBULAE WHICH ARE THOSE OF THE THIRD AND FOURTH FORMS STILL MAKE A DETACHED LINK IN THE GREAT CHAIN IT IS ALSO TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THERE MAY STILL BE SOME THINLY SCATTERED SOLITARY STARS BETWEEN THE LARGE INTERSTICES OF NEBULAE WHICH BEING SITUATED SO AS TO BE NEARLY EQUALLY ATTRACTED BY THE SEVERAL CLUSTERS WHEN THEY WERE FORMING REMAIN UNASSOCIATED AND THOUGH WE CANNOT EXPECT TO SEE THESE STARS ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR VAST DISTANCE YET WE MAY WELL PRESUME THAT THEIR NUM BER CANNOT BE VERY CONSIDERABLE IN COMPARISON TO THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY DRAWN INTO SYSTEMS WHICH CONJECTURE IS ALSO ABUN DANTLY CONFIRMED IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE NEBULAE ARE NEAR ENOUGH TO HAVE THEIR STARS VISIBLE FOR THEY ARE ALL INSULATED AND GENE RALLY TO BE SEEN UPON A VERY CLEAR AND PURE GROUND WITHOUT ANY STAR NEAR THEM THAT MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO THEM AND THOUGH I HAVE OFTEN SEEN THEM IN BEDS OF STARS YET FROM THE SIZE OF THESE LATTER WE MAY BE CERTAIN THAT THEY WERE MUCH NEARER TO US THAN THOSE NEBULAE AND BELONGED UNDOUBTEDLY TO OUR OWN

CROWDED AS TO HAVE ONLY A SQUARE SECOND OF SPACE ALLOWED THEM THE NEXT ASSIGNING THEM ONLY HALF A SECOND SQUARE HOWEVER WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT IN ALL PROBABILITY A VERY DIFFERENT ACCUMULATION OF STARS MAY TAKE PLACE IN DIFFERENT NEBULAE BY WHICH MEANS SOME OF THEM MAY ASSUME THE MILKY APPEARANCE THOUGH NOT NEAR SO FAR REMOVED FROM US WHILE CLUSTERS OF STARS ALSO MAY BECOME RESOLVABLE NEBULAE FROM THE SAME CAUSE THE DISTINCTNESS OF THE INSTRUMENT IS HERE ALSO CONCERNED AND AS TELESCOPES WITH LARGE APERTURES ARE NOT EASILY BROUGHT TO A GOOD FIGURE NEBULOUS APPEARANCES OF BOTH SORTS MAY

GIVE US SO MANY POINTS IN ITS SUR FACE I SHALL HOWEVER CONTENT MYSELF AT PRESENT WITH A SEC TION ONLY I HAVE TAKEN ONE WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE POLES OF OUR SYSTEM AND IS AT RECTANGLES TO THE CONJUNCTION OF THE BRANCHES WHICH I HAVE CALLED ITS LENGTH THE NAME OF POLES SEEMED TO ME NOT IMPROPERLY APPLIED TO THOSE POINTS WHICH ARE 90 DEGREES DISTANT FROM A CIRCLE PASSING ALONG THE MILKY WAY AND THE NORTH POLE IS HERE ASSUMED TO BE SITUATED IN RA 186 AND PD 58 THE SECTION REPRESENTED IN FIG 4 IS ONE WHICH MAKES AN ANGLE OF 35 DEGREES WITH OUR EQUATOR CROSSING IT IN 12412 AND 30412 DEGREES A CELESTIAL GLOBE ADJUSTED TO THE LATI TUDE OF 55 NORTH AND HAVING  CETI NEAR THE MERIDIAN WILL HAVE THE PLANE OF THIS SECTION POINTED OUT BY THE HORIZON AND THE GAGES WHICH HAVE BEEN USED IN THIS DELINEATION ARE THOSE WHICH IN TABLE 1 ARE MARKED BY ASTERISKS WHEN THE VISUAL RAYS ANSWERING TO THEM ARE TAKEN OUT OF THE SECOND TABLE THEY MUST BE PROJECTED ON THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON OF THE LATITUDE WHICH HAS BEEN POINTED OUT AND THIS MAY BE DONE ACCURATELY ENOUGH FOR THE PRESENT PURPOSE BY A GLOBE ADJUSTED AS ABOVE DI RECTED FOR AS GAGES EXACTLY IN THE PLANE OF THE SECTION WERE OFTEN WANTING I HAVE USED MANY AT SOME SMALL DISTANCE ABOVE AND BELOW THE SAME FOR THE SAKE OF OBTAINING MORE DELINEATING POINTS AND IN THE FIGURE THE STARS AT THE BORDERS WHICH ARE LARGER THAN THE REST ARE THOSE POINTED OUT BY THE GAGES THE  INTER254 MR HERSCHEL ON THE INTERMEDIATE PARTS ARE FILLED UP BY SMALLER STARS ARRANGED IN STRAIGHT LINES BETWEEN THE GAGED ONES THE DELINEATING POINTS THOUGH PRETTY NUMEROUS ARE NOT SO CLOSE AS WE MIGHT WISH IT IS HOWEVER TO BE HOPED THAT IN SOME FUTURE TIME THIS BRANCH OF ASTRONOMY WILL BECOME MORE CULTIVATED SO THAT WE MAY HAVE GAGES FOR EVERY QUARTER OF A DEGREE OF THE HEAVENS AT LEAST AND THESE OFTEN REPEATED IN THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUM STANCES AND WHENEVER THAT SHALL BE THE CASE THE DELINEATIONS MAY THEN BE REPEATED WITH ALL THE ACCURACY THAT LONG EXPERIENCE MAY ENABLE US TO INTRODUCE FOR THIS SUBJECT BEING SO NEW I LOOK UPON WHAT IS HERE GIVEN PARTLY AS ONLY AN EXAMPLE TO ILLUSTRATE THE SPIRIT OF THE METHOD FROM THIS FIGURE HOW EVER WHICH I HOPE IS NOT A VERY INACCURATE ONE WE MAY SEE THAT OUR NEBULA AS WE OBSERVED BEFORE IS OF THE THIRD FORM THAT IS A VERY EXTENSIVE BRANCHING COMPOUND CONGERIES OF MANY MILLIONS OF STARS WHICH MOST PROBABLY OWES ITS ORIGIN TO MANY REMARKABLY LARGE AS WELL AS PRETTY CLOSELY SCATTERED SMALL STARS THAT MAY HAVE DRAWN TOGETHER THE REST NOW TO HAVE SOME IDEA OF THE WONDERFUL EXTENT OF THIS SYSTEM I MUST OB SERVE THAT THIS SECTION OF IT IS DRAWN UPON A SCALE WHERE THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS IS NO MORE THAN THE 80TH PART OF AN INCH SO THAT PROBABLY ALL THE STARS WHICH IN THE FINEST NIGHTS WE ARE ABLE TO DISTINGUISH WITH THE NAKED EYE MAY BE COMPREHENDED WITHIN A SPHERE DRAWN ROUND THE LARGE STAR NEAR THE MIDDLE REPRESENTING OUR SITUATION IN THE NEBULA OF LESS THAN HALF A QUARTER OF AN INCH RADIUS THE ORIGIN OF NEBULOUS SIRATA IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE PARTS OF AN INDEFINITELY EXTENDED WHOLE THE NEBULA WE INHABIT MIGHT BE SAIDCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 255 SAID TO BE ONE THAT HAS FEWER MARKS OF PROFOUND ANTIQUITY UPON IT THAN THE REST TO EXPLAIN THIS IDEA PERHAPS MORE CLEARLY WE SHOULD RECOLLECT THAT THE CONDENSATION OF CLUSTERS OF STARS HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO A GRADUAL APPROACH AND WHOEVER REFLECTS ON THE NUMBERS OF AGES THAT MUST HAVE PAST BEFORE SOME OF THE CLUSTERS THAT WILL BE FOUND IN MY INTENDED CATALOGUE OF THEM COULD BE SO FAR CONDENSED AS WE FIND THEM AT PRESENT WILL NOT WONDER IF I ASCRIBE A CERTAIN AIR OF YOUTH AND VIGOUR TO MANY VERY REGULARLY SCATTERED REGIONS OF OUR SIDEREAL STRATUM THERE ARE MOREOVER MANY PLACES IN IT WHERE THERE IS THE GREATEST REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE STARS IF WE MAY JUDGE FROM AP PEARANCES ARE NOW DRAWING TOWARDS VARIOUS SECONDARY CENTERS AND WILL IN TIME SEPARATE INTO DIFFERENT CLUSTERS SO AS TO OCCA SION MANY SUBDIVISIONS HENCE WE MAY SURMISE THAT WHEN A NEBULOUS STRATUM CONSISTS CHIEFLY OF NEBULAE OF THE FIRST AND SE COND FORM IT PROBABLY OWES ITS ORIGIN TO WHAT MAY BE CALLED THE DECAY OF A GREAT COMPOUND NEBULA OF THE THIRD FORM AND THAT THE SUBDIVISIONS WHICH HAPPENED TO IT IN LENGTH OF TIME OCCASIONED ALL THE SMALL NEBULAE WHICH SPRUNG FROM IT TO LIE IN A CERTAIN RANGE ACCORDING AS THEY WERE DETACHED FROM THE PRI MARY ONE IN LIKE MANNER OUR SYSTEM AFTER NUMBERS OF AGES MAY VERY POSSIBLY BECOME DIVIDED SO AS TO GIVE RISE TO A STRATUM OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED NEBULAE FOR IT WOULD NOT BE DIFFICULT TO POINT OUT SO MANY BEGINNING OR GATHERING CLUSTERS IN IT F THIS VIEW OF THE PRESENT SUBJECT THROWS A CONSIDERABLE LIGHT UPON THE APPEARANCE OF THAT REMARKABLE COLLECTION OF MANY F MR MICHELL HAS ALSO CONSIDERED THE STARS AS GATHERED TOGETHER INTO GROUPS PHIL TRANS VOL LVII P 249 WHICH IDEA AGREES WITH THE SUBDIVISION OF OUR GREAT SYSTEM HERE POINTED OUT HE FOUNDS AN ELEGANT PROOF OF THIS ON THE COMPUTATION OF PROBABILITIES AND MENTIONS THE PLEIADES THE PRAESEPE CANCRI AND THE NEBULA OR CLUSTER OF STARS IN THE HILT OF PERSEUSS SWORD AS INSTANCES HUNDREDS256 MR HERSCHEL ON THE HUNDREDS OF NEBULAE WHICH ARE TO BE SEEN IN WHAT I HAVE CALLED THE NEBULOUS STRATUM OF COMA BERENICES IT APPEARS FROM THE EXTENDED AND BRANCHING FIGURE OF OUR NEBULA THAT THERE IS ROOM FOR THE DECOMPOSED SMALL NEBULAE OF A LARGE REDUCED FORMER GREAT ONE TO APPROACH NEARER TO US IN THE SIDES THAN IN OTHER PARTS NAY POSSIBLY THERE MIGHT ORIGINALLY BE ANOTHER VERY LARGE JOINING BRANCH WHICH IN TIME BECAME SEPARATED BY THE CONDENSATION OF THE STARS AND THIS MAY BE THE REASON OF THE LITTLE REMAINING BREADTH OF OUR SYSTEM IN THAT VERY PLACE FOR THE NEBULAE OF THE STRATUM OF THE COMA ARE BRIGHTEST AND MOST CROWDED JUST OPPOSITE OUR SITUATION OR IN THE POLE OF OUR SYSTEM AS SOON AS THIS IDEA WAS SUGGESTED I TRIED ALSO THE OPPOSITE POLE WHERE ACCORDINGLY I HAVE MET WITH A GREAT NUMBER OF NEBULAE THOUGH UNDER A MUCH MORE SCATTERED FORM AN OPENING IN THE HEAVENS SOME PARTS OF OUR SYSTEM INDEED SEEM ALREADY TO HAVE SUS TAINED GREATER RAVAGES OF TIME THAN OTHERS IF THIS WAY OF EX PRESSING MYSELF MAY BE ALLOWED FOR INSTANCE IN THE BODY OF THE SCORPION IS AN OPENING OR HOLE WHICH IS PROBABLY OWING TO THIS CAUSE I FOUND IT WHILE I WAS GAGING IN THE PARALLEL FROM 112 TO 114 DEGREES OF NORTH POLAR DISTANCE AS I APPROACHED THE MILKY WAY THE GAGES HAD BEEN GRADUALLY RUNNING UP FROM 97 TO 171 WHEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY FELL DOWN TO NOTHING A VERY FEW PRETTY LARGE STARS EXCEPTED WHICH MADE THEM SHEW 05 07 11 14 18 AFTER WHICH THEY AGAIN ROSE TO 47 135 203 AND SOON AFTER TO 411 THIS OPENING IS AT LEAST 4 DEGREES BROAD BUT ITS HEIGHT I HAVE NOT YET ASCERTAINED IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE 80 NEBULEUSE SANS ETOILES OF THE CON NOISSANCE DES TEMPS WHICH IS ONE OF THE RICHEST AND MOST COM PRESSEDCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 257 PRESSED CLUSTERS OF SMALL STARS I REMEMBER TO HAVE SEEN IS SITUATED JUST ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF IT AND WOULD ALMOST AU THORISE A SUSPICION THAT THE STARS OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED WERE COLLECTED FROM THAT PLACE AND HAD LEFT THE VACANCY WHAT ADDS NOT A LITTLE TO THIS SURMISE IS THAT THE SAME PHAENOMENON IS ONCE MORE REPEATED WITH THE FOURTH CLUSTER OF STARS OF THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS WHICH IS ALSO ON THE WESTERN BORDER OF ANOTHER VACANCY AND HAS MOREOVER A SMALL MINIATURE CLUSTER OR EASILY RESOLVABLE NEBULA OF ABOUT 212 MINUTES IN DIAMETER NORTH FOLLOWING IT AT NO VERY GREAT DISTANCE PHAENOMENA AT THE POLES OF OUR NEBULA I OUGHT TO OBSERVE THAT THERE IS A REMARKABLE PURITY OR CLEAR NESS IN THE HEAVENS WHEN WE LOOK OUT OF OUR STRATUM AT THE SIDES THAT IS TOWARDS LEO VIRGO AND COMA BERENICES ON ONE HAND AND TOWARDS CETUS ON THE OTHER WHEREAS THE GROUND OF THE HEAVENS BECOMES TROUBLED AS WE APPROACH TOWARDS THE LENGTH OR HEIGHT OF IT IT WAS A GOOD WHILE BEFORE I COULD TRACE THE CAUSE OF THESE PHAENOMENA BUT SINCE I HAVE BEEN ACQUAINTED WITH THE SHAPE OF OUR SYSTEM IT IS PLAIN THAT THESE TROUBLED APPEARANCES WHEN WE APPROACH TO THE SIDES ARE EASILY TO BE EXPLAINED BY ASCRIBING THEM TO SOME OF THE DISTANT STRAG GLING STARS THAT YIELD HARDLY LIGHT ENOUGH TO BE DISTINGUISHED AND I HAVE INDEED OFTEN EXPERIENCED THIS TO BE ACTUALLY THE CAUSE BY EXAMINING THESE TROUBLED SPOTS FOR A LONG WHILE TOGE THER WHEN AT LAST I GENERALLY PERCEIVED THE STARS WHICH OCCA SIONED THEM BUT WHEN WE LOOK TOWARDS THE POLES OF OUR SYSTEM WHERE THE VISUAL RAY DOES NOT GRAZE ALONG THE SIDE THE VOL LXXV L L STRAGGLING258 MR HERSCHEL ON THE STRAGGLING STARS OF COURSE WILL BE VERY FEW IN NUMBER AND THEREFORE THE GROUND OF THE HEAVENS WILL ASSUME THAT PURITY WHICH I HAVE ALWAYS OBSERVED TO TAKE PLACE IN THOSE REGIONS ENUMERATION OF VERY COMPOUND NEBULAE OR MILKYWAYS AS WE ARE USED TO CALL THE APPEARANCE OF THE HEAVENS WHERE IT IS SURROUNDED WITH A BRIGHT ZONE THE MILKYWAY IT MAY NOT BE AMISS TO POINT OUT SOME OTHER VERY REMARKABLE NEBULAE WHICH CANNOT WELL BE LESS BUT ARE PROBABLY MUCH LARGER THAN OUR OWN SYSTEM AND BEING ALSO EXTENDED THE INHABITANTS OF THE PLANETS THAT ATTEND THE STARS WHICH COMPOSE THEM MUST LIKEWISE PERCEIVE THE SAME PHAENOMENA FOR WHICH REASON THEY MAY ALSO BE CALLED MILKYWAYS BY WAY OF DISTINCTION MY OPINION OF THEIR SIZE IS GROUNDED ON THE FOLLOWING OB SERVATIONS THERE ARE MANY ROUND NEBULAE OF THE FIRST FORM OF ABOUT FIVE OR SIX MINUTES IN DIAMETER THE STARS OF WHICH I CAN SEE VERY DISTINCTLY AND ON COMPARING THEM WITH THE VISUAL RAY CALCULATED FROM SOME OF MY LONG GAGES I SUPPOSE BY THE AP PEARANCE OF THE SMALL STARS IN THOSE GAGES THAT THE CENTERS OF THESE ROUND NEBULAE MAY BE 600 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS FROM US IN ESTIMATING THE DISTANCE OF SUCH CLUSTERS I CONSULTED RATHER THE COMPARATIVELY APPARENT SIZE OF THE STARS THAN THEIR MUTUAL DISTANCE FOR THE CONDENSATION IN THESE CLUSTERS BEING PROBABLY MUCH GREATER THAN IN OUR OWN SYSTEM IF WE WERE TO OVERLOOK THIS CIRCUMSTANCE AND CALCULATE BY THEIR APPA RENT COMPRESSION WHERE IN ABOUT SIX MINUTES DIAMETER THERE ARE PERHAPS TEN OR MORE STARS IN THE LINE OF MEASURES WE SHOULD FIND THAT ON THE SUPPOSITION OF AN EQUAL SCATTERING OF THE STARS THROUGHOUT ALL NEBULAE THE DISTANCE OF THE CENTER OF SUCH A CLUSTER FROM US COULD NOT BE LESS THAN 6000 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF 7CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 259 OF SIRIUS AND PERHAPS IN PUTTING IT BY THE APPARENT SIZE OF THE STARS AT 600 ONLY I MAY HAVE CONSIDERABLY UNDERRATED IT BUT MY ARGUMENT IF THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE WILL BE SO MUCH THE STRONGER NOW TO PROCEED SOME OF THESE ROUND NEBULAE HAVE OTHERS NEAR THEM PERFECTLY SIMILAR IN FORM COLOUR AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF STARS BUT OF ONLY HALF THE DIAMETER AND THE STARS IN THEM SEEM TO BE DOUBLY CROWDED AND ONLY AT ABOUT HALF THE DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE INDEED SO SMALL AS NOT TO BE VISIBLE WITHOUT THE UTMOST ATTENTION I SUPPOSE THESE MINIATURE NEBULAE TO BE AT DOUBLE THE DISTANCE OF THE FIRST AN INSTANCE EQUALLY REMARKABLE AND INSTRUCTIVE IS A CASE WHERE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF TWO SUCH NEBULAE AS HAVE BEEN MENTIONED I MET WITH A THIRD SIMILAR RESOLVABLE BUT MUCH SMALLER AND FAINTER NEBULA THE STARS OF IT ARE NO LONGER TO BE PERCEIVED BUT A RESEMBLANCE OF COLOUR WITH THE FORMER TWO AND ITS DIMINISHED SIZE AND LIGHT MAY WELL PER MIT US TO PLACE IT AT FULL TWICE THE DISTANCE OF THE SECOND OR ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE TIMES THAT OF THE FIRST AND YET THE NEBU LOSITY IS NOT OF THE MILKY KIND NOR IS IT SO MUCH AS DIFFICULTLY RESOLVABLE OR COLOURLESS NOW IN A FEW OF THE EXTENDED NE BULAE THE LIGHT CHANGES GRADUALLY SO AS FROM THE RESOLVABLE TO APPROACH TO THE MILKY KIND WHICH APPEARS TO ME AN INDICA TION THAT THE MILKY LIGHT OF NEBULAE IS OWING TO THEIR MUCH GREATER DISTANCE A NEBULA THEREFORE WHOSE LIGHT IS PERFECTLY MILKY CANNOT WELL BE SUPPOSED TO BE AT LESS THAN SIX OR EIGHT THOUSAND TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS AND THOUGH THE NUMBERS HERE ASSUMED ARE NOT TO BE TAKEN OTHERWISE THAN AS VERY COARSE ESTIMATES YET AN EXTENDED NEBULA WHICH IN AN OBLIQUE SITUA TION WHERE IT IS POSSIBLY FORESHORTENED BY ONEHALF TWOTHIRDS OR THREEFOURTHS OF ITS LENGTH SUBTENDS A DEGREE OR MORE IN L L 2 DIAMETER260 MR HERSCHEL ON THE DIAMETER CANNOT BE OTHERWISE THAN OF A WONDERFUL MAGNITUDE AND MAY WELL OUTVIE OUR MILKYWAY IN GRANDEUR THE FIRST I SHALL MENTION IS A MILKY RAY OF MORE THAN A DE GREE IN LENGTH IT TAKES K FL 52 CYGNI INTO ITS EXTENT TO THE NORTH OF WHICH IT IS CROOKEDLY BENT SO AS TO BE CONVEX TOWARDS THE FOLLOWING SIDE AND THE LIGHT OF IT IS PRETTY INTENSE TO THE SOUTH OF K IT IS MORE DIFFUSED LESS BRIGHT AND LOSES ITSELF WITH SOME EXTENSION IN TWO BRANCHES I BELIEVE BUT FOR WANT OF LIGHT I COULD NOT DETERMINE THIS CIRCUMSTANCE THE NORTHERN HALF IS NEAR TWO MINUTES BROAD BUT THE SOUTHERN IS NOT SUFFICIENTLY DEFINED TO ASCERTAIN ITS BREADTH THE NEXT IS AN EXTREMELY FAINT MILKY RAY ABOVE 34 DEGREE LONG AND 8 OR 10 BROAD EXTENDED FROM NORTH PRECEDING TO SOUTH FOLLOWING IT MAKES AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 30 OR 40 DEGREES WITH THE MERIDIAN AND CONTAINS THREE OR FOUR PLACES THAT ARE BRIGHTER THAN THE REST THE STARS OF THE GALAXY ARE SCATTERED OVER IT IN THE SAME MANNER AS OVER THE REST OF THE HEAVENS IT FOLLOWS  CYGNI 115 MINUTES IN TIME AND IS 2 19 MORE SOUTH THE THIRD IS A BRANCHING NEBULOSITY OF ABOUT A DEGREE AND A HALF IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND ABOUT 48 EXTENT IN POLAR DISTANCE THE FOLLOWING PART OF IT IS DIVIDED INTO SEVERAL STREAMS AND WINDINGS WHICH AFTER SEPARATING MEET EACH OTHER AGAIN TOWARDS THE SOUTH IT PRECEDES  CYGNI 16 IN TIME AND IS 1 16 MORE NORTH I SUPPOSE THIS TO BE JOINED TO THE PRECEDING ONE BUT HAVING OBSERVED THEM IN DIFFERENT SWEEPS THERE WAS NO OPPORTUNITY OF TRACING THEIR CONNECTION THE FOURTH IS A FAINT EXTENDED MILKY RAY OF ABOUT 17 IN LENGTH AND 12 IN BREADTH IT IS BRIGHTEST AND BROADEST IN THE MIDDLE AND THE ENDS LOSE THEMSELVES IT HAS A SMALL ROUND VERY FAINT NEBULA JUST NORTH OF IT AND ALSO IN ANOTHER PLACE A SPOT BRIGHTER THAN THE REST ALMOST DETACHED ENOUGH TO FORM A DIFFERENTCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 261 A DIFFERENT NEBULA BUT PROBABLY BELONGING TO THE GREAT ONE THE RAY PRECEDES  TRIANGULI 188 IN TIME AND IS 55 MORE NORTH ANOTHER OBSERVATION OF THE SAME IN A FINER EVENING MENTIONS ITS EXTENDING MUCH FARTHER TOWARDS THE SOUTH AND THAT THE BREADTH OF IT PROBABLY IS NOT LESS THAN HALF A DEGREE BUT BEING SHADED AWAY BY IMPERCEPTIBLE GRADATIONS IT IS DIFFI CULT EXACTLY TO ASSIGN ITS LIMITS THE FIFTH IS A STREAK OF LIGHT ABOUT 27 LONG AND IN THE BRIGHTEST PART 3 OR 4 BROAD THE EXTENT IS NEARLY IN THE MERI DIAN OR A LITTLE FROM SOUTH PRECEDING TO NORTH FOLLOWING IT FOLLOWS  CETI 59 IN TIME AND IS 2 43 MORE SOUTH THE SITUATION IS SO LOW THAT IT WOULD PROBABLY APPEAR OF A MUCH GREATER EXTENT IN A HIGHER ALTITUDE THE SIXTH IS AN EXTENSIVE MILKY NEBULOSITY DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS THE MOST NORTH BEING THE STRONGEST ITS EXTENT EXCEEDS 15 THE SOUTHERN PART IS FOLLOWED BY A PARCEL OF STARS WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE THE 8TH OF THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS THE SEVENTH IS A WONDERFUL EXTENSIVE NEBULOSITY OF THE MILKY KIND THERE ARE SEVERAL STARS VISIBLE IN IT BUT THEY CAN HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THAT NEBULOSITY AND ARE DOUBTLESS BELONG ING TO OUR OWN SYSTEM SCATTERED BEFORE IT IT IS THE 17TH OF THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS IN THE LIST OF THESE MUST ALSO BE RECKONED THE BEAUTIFUL NE BULA OF ORION ITS EXTENT IS MUCH ABOVE ONE DEGREE THE EASTERN BRANCH PASSES BETWEEN TWO VERY SMALL STARS AND RUNS ON TILL IT MEETS A VERY BRIGHT ONE CLOSE TO THE FOUR SMALL STARS WHICH CAN HAVE NO CONNECTION WITH THE NEBULA IS A TOTAL BLACK NESS AND WITHIN THE OPEN PART TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST IS A DISTINCT SMALL FAINT NEBULA OF AN EXTENDED SHAPE AT A DISTANCE FROM THE BORDER OF THE GREAT ONE TO WHICH IT RUNS IN A PARALLEL 4 DIRECTION262 MR HERSCHEL ON THE DIRECTION RESEMBLING THE SHOALS THAT ARE SEEN NEAR THE COASTS OF SOME ISLANDS THE NINTH IS THAT IN THE GIRDLE OF ANDROMEDA WHICH IS UN DOUBTEDLY THE NEAREST OF ALL THE GREAT NEBULAE ITS EXTENT IS ABOVE A DEGREE AND A HALF IN LENGTH AND IN EVEN ONE OF THE NARROWEST PLACES NOT LESS THAN 16 IN BREADTH THE BRIGHTEST PART OF IT APPROACHES TO THE RESOLVABLE NEBULOSITY AND BEGINS TO SHEW A FAINT RED COLOUR WHICH FROM MANY OBSERVATIONS ON THE COLOUR AND MAGNITUDE OF NEBULAE I BELIEVE TO BE AN INDICA TION THAT ITS DISTANCE IN THIS COLOURED PART DOES NOT EXCEED 2000 TIMES THE DISTANCE OF SIRIUS THERE IS A VERY CONSIDERABLE BROAD PRETTY FAINT SMALL NEBULA NEAR IT MY SISTER DISCOVERED IT AUGUST 27 1783 WITH A NEWTONIAN 2FEET SWEEPER IT SHEWS THE SAME FAINT COLOUR WITH THE GREAT ONE AND IS NO DOUBT IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF IT IT IS NOT THE 32D OF THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS WHICH IS A PRETTY LARGE ROUND NEBULA MUCH CON DENSED IN THE MIDDLE AND SOUTH FOLLOWING THE GREAT ONE BUT THIS IS ABOUT TWOTHIRDS OF A DEGREE NORTH PRECEDING IT IN A LINE PARALLEL TO  AND  ANDROMEDAE TO THESE MAY BE ADDED THE NEBULA IN VULPECULA FOR THOUGH ITS APPEARANCE IS NOT LARGE IT IS PROBABLY A DOUBLE STRATUM OF STARS OF A VERY GREAT EXTENT ONE END WHEREOF IS TURNED TOWARDS US THAT IT IS THUS SITUATED MAY BE SURMISED FROM ITS CONTAIN ING IN DIFFERENT PARTS NEARLY ALL THE THREE NEBULOSITIES VIZ THE RESOLVABLE THE COLOURED BUT IRRESOLVABLE AND A TINCTURE OF THE MILKY KIND NOW WHAT GREAT LENGTH MUST BE REQUIRED TO PRODUCE THESE EFFECTS MAY EASILY BE CONCEIVED WHEN IN ALL PRO BABILITY OUR WHOLE SYSTEM OF ABOUT 800 STARS IN DIAMETER IF IT WERE SEEN AT SUCH A DISTANCE THAT ONE END OF IT MIGHT ASSUME THE RESOLVABLE NEBULOSITY WOULD NOT AT THE OTHER END PRESENT USCONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS 263 US WITH THE IRRESOLVABLE MUCH LESS WITH THE COLOURLESS AND MILKY SORT OF NEBULOSITIES A PERFORATED NEBULA OR RING OF STARS AMONG THE CURIOSITIES OF THE HEAVENS SHOULD BE PLACED A NEBULA THAT HAS A REGULAR CONCENTRIC DARK SPOT IN THE MIDDLE AND IS PROBABLY A RING OF STARS IT IS OF AN OVAL SHAPE THE SHORTER AXIS BEING TO THE LONGER AS ABOUT 83 TO 100 SO THAT IF THE STARS FORM A CIRCLE ITS INCLINATION TO A LINE DRAWN FROM THE SUN TO THE CENTER OF THIS NEBULA MUST BE ABOUT 56 DEGREES THE LIGHT IS OF THE RESOLVABLE KIND AND IN THE NORTHERN SIDE THREE VERY FAINT STARS MAY BE SEEN AS ALSO ONE OR TWO IN THE SOUTHERN PART THE VERTICES OF THE LONGER AXIS SEEM LESS BRIGHT AND NOT SO WELL DEFINED AS THE REST THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALL STARS VERY NEAR BUT NONE THAT SEEM TO BELONG TO IT IT IS THE 57TH OF THE CONNOISSANCE DES TEMPS FIG 5 IS A REPRESENTATION OF IT PLANETARY NEBULAE I SHALL CONCLUDE THIS PAPER WITH AN ACCOUNT OF A FEW HEA VENLY BODIES THAT FROM

ADMIT THAT THE INTRINSIC LIGHT OF SOME STARS MAY BE VERY MUCH INFERIOR TO THAT OF THE GENERALITY WHICH HOWEVER CAN HARDLY BE IMAGINED TO EXTEND TO SUCH A DEGREE WE MIGHT SUSPECT THEM TO BE COMETS ABOUT THEIR APHELION IF THE BRIGHT NESS AS WELL AS MAGNITUDE OF THE DIAMETERS DID NOT OPPOSE THIS IDEA SO THAT AFTER ALL WE CAN HARDLY FIND ANY HYPOTHESIS SO PROBABLE AS THAT OF THEIR BEING NEBULAE BUT THEN THEY MUST CONSIST OF STARS THAT ARE COMPRESSED AND ACCUMULATED IN THE HIGHEST DEGREE IF IT WERE NOT PERHAPS TOO HAZARDOUS TO PURSUE A FORMER SURMISE OF A RENEWAL IN WHAT I FIGURATIVELY CALLED THE LABORATORIES OF THE UNIVERSE THE STARS FORMING THESE EXTRAORDI NARY NEBULAEBY SOME DECAY OR WASTE OF NATURE BEING NO LONGER VOL LXXV M M FIT266 MR HERSCHEL ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE HEAVENS FIT FOR THEIR FORMER PURPOSES AND HAVING THEIR PROJECTILE FORCES IF ANY SUCH THEY HAD RETARDED IN EACH OTHERS ATMOSPHERE MAY RUSH AT LAST TOGETHER AND EITHER IN SUCCESSION OR BY ONE GENERAL TREMENDOUS SHOCK UNITE INTO A NEW BODY PERHAPS THE EX TRAORDINARY AND SUDDEN BLAZE OF A NEW STAR IN CASSIOPEAS CHAIR IN 1572 MIGHT POSSIBLY BE OF SUCH A NATURE BUT LEST I SHOULD BE LED TOO FAR FROM THE PATH OF OBSERVATION TO WHICH I AM RESOLVED TO LIMIT MYSELF I SHALL ONLY POINT OUT A CONSIDERABLE USE THAT MAY BE MADE OF THESE CURIOUS BODIES IF A LITTLE ATTEN TION TO THEM SHOULD PROVE THAT HAVING NO ANNUAL PARALLAX THEY BELONG MOST PROBABLY TO THE CLASS OF NEBULAE THEY MAY THEN BE EXPECTED TO KEEP THEIR SITUATION BETTER THAN ANY ONE OF THE STARS BELONGING TO OUR SYSTEM ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR BEING PRO BABLY AT A VERY GREAT DISTANCE NOW TO HAVE A FIXED POINT SOMEWHERE IN THE HEAVENS TO WHICH THE MOTIONS OF THE REST MAY BE REFERRED IS CERTAINLY OF CONSIDERABLE CONSEQUENCE IN ASTRONOMY AND BOTH THESE BODIES ARE BRIGHT AND SMALL ENOUGH TO ANSWER THAT END H DATCHET NEAR WINDSOR W HERSCHEL JANUARY 1 1785 H HAVING FOUND TWO MORE OF THESE CURIOUS OBJECTS I ADD THE PLACE OF THEM HERE IN HOPES THAT THOSE WHO HAVE FIXED INSTRUMENTS MAY BE INDUCED TO TAKE AN EARLY OPPORTUNITY OF OBSERVING THEM CAREFULLY FEB 1 1785 A VERY BRIGHT PLANETARY NEBULA ABOUT HALF A MINUTE IN DIAME TER BUT THE EDGES ARE NOT VERY WELL DEFINED IT IS PERFECTLY ROUND OR PERHAPS A VERY LITTLE ELLIPTICAL AND ALL OVER OF AN UNIFORM BRIGHTNESS WITH HIGHER POWERS IT BECOMES PROPORTIONALLY MAGNIFIED IT FOLLOWS  ERIDANI 16 16 IN TIME AND IS 49 MORE NORTH THAN THAT STAR FEB 7 1785 A BEAUTIFUL VERY BRILLIANT GLOBE OF LIGHT A LITTLE HAZY ON THE EDGES BUT THE HAZINESS GOES OFF VERY SUDDENLY SO AS NOT TO EXCEED THE 20TH PART OF THE DIAMETER WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE FROM 30 TO 40 IT IS ROUND OR PERHAPS A VERY LITTLE ELLIPTICAL AND ALL OVER OF AN UNIFORM BRIGHTNESS I SUPPOSE THE INTENSITY OF ITS LIGHT TO BE EQUAL TO THAT OF A STAR OF THE NINTH MAGNITUDE IT PRECEDES THE THIRD B FL 6 CRATERIS 28 36 IN TIME AND IS 1 25 MORE NORTH THAN THAT STARFIG 1 FIG 2 V N H L XPHILOS V P FIG4 M FIG5PHILOSTRANSVOLLXXVTABVIIIP266 V FIG3 S N

FOSTERS EXPERIINEIDT ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND BY DR GERARD MOLL PROFESSOR OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY IN THE UNI VERSITY OF UTRECHT COMMUNICATED BY CAPTAIN HENRY KATER VPRS READ JANUARY 17 1828 IDURING CAPTAIN PARRYSWINTER RESIDENCE AT PORT BOWEN IN 18241825 EXPERIMENTS WERE INSTITUTED ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND AS PROBABLY INVES TIGATIONS OF THAT SORT WILL NOT FREQUENTLY BE MADE AT SUCH LOW TEMPERATURES IT APPEARS NOT UNINTERESTING TO COMPARE THE RESULTS OBTAINED WITH THE THEORETICAL FORMULA OF THE LATE LAMENTED LAPLACE AND ALSO WITH OTHER EXPERIMENTS MADE UNDER DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES WITH THIS VIEW I CAUSED MY ASSISTANT M SIMONS TO MAKE THE CALCULATIONS OF WHICH I AM ABOUT TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT CAPTAIN PARRYS AND LIEUT FOSTEILS EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE AT PORT BOWEII IN 730 13 39 N

THUS THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CAPTAIN PARRYS EXPERIMENTS AND OURS WHEN BOTH ARE REDUCED TO THE SAME TEMPERATURE OF 00 IS 1OLL LM7 AND 0M8 THESE DIFFERENCES WILL BE DEEMED VERY SMALL IF WE CONSIDER THAT BETWEEN OUR OWN EXPERIMENTS THE DIFFERENCE WAS 066 METR AND THAT BETWEEN THOSE OF THE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH BOARD OF LONGITUDE THERE WERE STILL MORE CON SIDERABLE DIFFERENCES THESE RESULTS ON THE WHOLE APPEAR VERY SATISFACTORY AND THE NEAR AGREE INENT OF EXPERIMENTS MADE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES SO WIDELY DIFFERENT MUST LEAD US TO SUSPECT THAT WHATEVER DIFFERENCE STILL REMAINS BETWEEN THE RESULTS OF COMPUTATION AND OBSERVATION MUST BE ASCRIBED IN A GREAT MEASURE TO SOME IMPERFECTION OF THE THEORETICAL FORMULA AND NOT TO ANY FAULT OR NEGLECT OF THE OBSERVERS ANOTHER CONCLUSION MAY BE FAIRLY DRAWN FROM THE COINCIDENCE OF THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY CAPTAIN PARRY AND HIS FRIEND WITH THOSE OF MANY OTHER OBSERVERS I MEAN THE GREAT ACCURACY WITH WHICH CAPTAIN PARRYS PROCEEDINGS WERE CON DUCTED OUR OWN EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE UNDER EVERY FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCE  IN THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER IN A PLACE WHERE NOTHING WAS WANTED WHICH COULD GIVE EASE AND COMFORT TO THE OBSERVERS CAPTAIN PARRY AND LIEUT FOSTER OPERATED IN A DREARY CLIMATE PARTLY IN A POLAR WINTER FAR FROM EVERY THING WHICH COULD MAKE THEIR TASK EASY AND ABOVE ALL AT A TEMPERATURE OF WHICH IT IS FRIGHTFUL TO THINK BESIDES THIS CAPTAIN PARRY HAD MANY OTHER IMPORTANT MATTERS AT THE TIME COMMITTED TO HIS CARE OUR OBSERVATIONS AND THOSE OF MANY OTHER OBSERVERS WERE A PARTY OF PLEASURE THEIRS A PAINFUL DRUDGERY AND STILL WITH EVERY THING THUS IN OUR FAVOUR PROVIDED WITH ALL THE MEANS WHICH WE COULD THINK OF WE COULD DO NO BETTER THAN HE DID IN THE MOST INHOS PITABLE CLIMATE OF THE GLOBE IT APPEARS THAT CAPTAIN PARRYS EXPERIMENTS ARE AS ACCURATE AS THOSE OF ANY OTHER OBSERVER THIS EQUALITY I SHOULD CONSIDER AS A PROOF OF SUPERIORITY CONSIDERING THE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE EXPERIMENTS AT PORT BOWEN WERE MADE

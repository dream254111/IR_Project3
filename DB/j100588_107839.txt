FosTERs experiineidt on the velocity of sound By Dr GERARD MOLL Professor of Natural Philosophy in the Uni versity of Utrecht Communicated by Captain HENRY KATER VPRS Read January 17 1828 IDURING Captain PARRYSwinter residence at Port Bowen in 18241825 experiments were instituted on the velocity of sound As probably inves tigations of that sort will not frequently be made at such low temperatures it appears not uninteresting to compare the results obtained with the theoretical formula of the late lamented LAPLACE and also with other experiments made under different circumstances With this view I caused my assistant M SimoNs to make the calculations of which I am about to render an account Captain PARRYs and Lieut FosTEILs experiments were made at Port Boweii in 730 13 39 N ands880 54 55 W of Greenwich The distance of the brass sixpounder from the station of the observers was trigonometrically determined by Captain PARRY to be 1289296 English feet and by Lieut FOSTER 1289282 feet  the mean being 1289289 feet Time was measured by pocket chro nometers held close to the observers ears The direction of the gun was S 710 48 E The table of the experiments is repeated to

suggested by the observers themselves that the experiment of the 4th of June was influenced by a strong wind blowing in the direction of the base I shall not take the result of that day into the account From the mean of all the other observations we have the velocity of sound in one second equal to 103519 English feet at a barometric pressure of 29936 English inches the temperature being 17072 FAHR LAPLACES theoretical formula for the computation of the velocity of sound is V  vKP Xv V being that velocity p the barometric pressure D the density of the air  the ratio between the specific heat of air at a constant pressure and at C a constant volume Taking the French metre equal to 3938255 English inches t as results from English and French comparisons we have 103519 feet 3154597826 metres 29936 inches  076013 metres 1772 FAHR 27o1 Centig According to Biors and ARAGos experiments and taking the dilatation of mercury by heat as determined by DULONG and PETIT we have the weight of a cube centimetre of mercury at 0 Centig 13596152 grammes The same philosophers found the weight of a cube centimetre of dry atmospheric air under a pressure of 760 millimetres and at a temperature of 00 Centig at Paris in latitude 48 50 14 equal to 0001299541 grammes To compute from these data the weight of a cube centimetre of atmospheric air at Port Bowen at the temperature of 0 Centig and the pressure of 760 millimetres we must multiply the number 0001299541 by the ratio of the intensity of gra vity at Paris and at Port Bowen Let the intensity of gravity at Port Bowen be g

February 1825   Again comparing the experiments of the 22nd March and 3d June with theory we may hope to have some compensation for the effect of wind On the 22nd March the wind was westerly and on the 3d June easterly Both experiments were made at a temperature comparatively high The velocity of sound was by the mean of the experiments of these two days 106248 English feet or 323741284 metr The barometric pressure was 30188 inches or 076653 metr The temperature was 60 FAHR or l 44 Centig Calculating with these data we have the velocity of sound on the 22nd March and 3d June by theory

which are re corded in the Phil Trans for 1824 we had the following differences between calculation and experiment By the experiments of 27th June 1823 difference 492 metr  16147 feet By the experiments of 28th June 1823 difference 424 metr  13916 feet The final inference to be drawn appears that in those high latitudes the un certainty of the data on which the calculations are founded is somewhat greater than at higher temperatures LAPLACE himself says of these differences  qu elles paraissent etre dans les limites des petites erreurs dont cette experience et les elemens de calcul dont jai fait usage sont encore susceptibles Perhaps it might occur to some that Captain PARRY and Lieut FOSTER ought to have observed the hygrometer but I think the objection unfounded I believe it may be shown that even supposing the air saturated with aqueous vapour it could at those low temperatures have no influence on the velocity of sound Let the tension of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere be T According to M GAYLussAcs experiments the density of aqueous vapour is 1 of the density of dry air Thus we have D   t f 104 o155 x 076  1  000375 t which being substituted in the theoretical formula it becomes g  p 104155 x 076 1 000375 t Cf v pI T XVC We calculated Captain PARRYS and Lieut FOSTERS experiments by the formula V O411s55 g 076l1O00075 t X thus we have V V I P  Now supposing

was as moist as possible the difference in the velocity of sound at such low temperatures could be only 00623921 metr or about 2 inches  Calculating on the same supposition the experiments of the 17th and 21st February and of the 22nd March and the 3d of June 1825 and supposing the air as moist as can be we have for the 17th and 21st of February 1825 V  30643213 metr and thus the velocity altered by 004141 metr or about 1 X inch in 1 For the experiments of the 22nd March and the 3d June 1825 the difference is somewhat greater For we have then V  31864481 metr and the velocity is altered by 0156801 metr or 6 inches  BIOT Traite de Physique T I p 277EXPERIMENTS ON THE VELOCITY OF SOUND 103 At all events the effect produced by moisture under the circumstances in which the experiments at Port Bowen were made is so trifling that it may safely be neglected altogether I shall now proceed to compare the experiments of the northern navigators with those of Dr VAN BrEK and myself and shall reduce for that purpose the Port Bowen experiments to what they would have been at the temperature of 00 C or 320 F Taking V as the velocity of sound at 00 C and D the density of air at that temperature we have Let V be the velocity at a temperature t we have again V do O300375 t X  C wherefore  V  1000375 t The mean of Captain PARRYs and Lieut FOSTERS experiments excepting those of the

And for those of the 22nd of March and 3d of June 33285 Dr VAN BEEKS and my experiments give   33205 Messrs STAMPFER and VON MYRBACH in 1822 in Germany 33325 Messrs ARAGO MATHIEU and BjOT in France

Thus the differences between Captain PARRYS experiments and ours when both are reduced to the same temperature of 00 is 1oll lm7 and 0m8 These differences will be deemed very small if we consider that between our own experiments the difference was 066 metr and that between those of the members of the French Board of Longitude there were still more con siderable differences These results on the whole appear very satisfactory and the near agree inent of experiments made under circumstances so widely different must lead us to suspect that whatever difference still remains between the results of computation and observation must be ascribed in a great measure to some imperfection of the theoretical formula and not to any fault or neglect of the observers Another conclusion may be fairly drawn from the coincidence of the results obtained by Captain PARRY and his friend with those of many other observers I mean the great accuracy with which Captain PARRYS proceedings were con ducted Our own experiments were made under every favourable circumstance  in the middle of summer in a place where nothing was wanted which could give ease and comfort to the observers Captain PARRY and Lieut FOSTER operated in a dreary climate partly in a polar winter far from every thing which could make their task easy and above all at a temperature of which it is frightful to think Besides this Captain PARRY had many other important matters at the time committed to his care Our observations and those of many other observers were a party of pleasure theirs a painful drudgery And still with every thing thus in our favour provided with all the means which we could think of we could do no better than he did in the most inhos pitable climate of the globe It appears that Captain PARRYS experiments are as accurate as those of any other observer This equality I should consider as a proof of superiority considering the peculiar circumstances under which the experiments at Port Bowen were made

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009148,American Banking and the Money Supply of the Future,i242481,AMERICAN BANKING AND THE MONEY SUPPLY OF THE FUTURE It seems to me that the subject of banking and its kindred topic the currency is often treated by those who are presumed to know most about both in a manner altogether too complicated too confusing and therefore dis couraging to the reader or listener The necessity for this I never could fathom for each is quite as simple in its nature as the problems children solve at thirteen and far less diffi cult to comprehend than the questions often put to Civil Service candidates If the air of mystery and the element of obscurity indulged in so often is supposed to carry with it the semisanctity of unusual profundity which the teacher or speaker possesses I think the effect is miscalculated and that this obtuse elaborate and muddy way of furnishing in formation is rather likely to cause the suspicion that the learned authority is rather deficient than that he is overly equipped in the science and practice of that which he essays to enlighten others upon It will make itself clear from start to finish that the writer of this small contribution to the common stock of familiar information prefers the simple and direct rather than the complex and roundabout way of presenting his views upon an everyday and naturally simple and easily understood question FOUR PERIODS IN AMERICAN BANKING HISTORY Banking in the United States may be said to have gone through four epochs beginning earlier than the Union itself and ending with the adoption of a more complete and efficient system than our present has come to be Prior to the year 1781 we can scarcely say we had much if any banking as we now understand it for with the Bank of North America founded December 31 178r and 559132 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY still in existence at Philadelphia the idea of banks uniting the functions of circulation deposit exchange and discount may fairly be said to begin The earliest socalled banks were in reality not banks but a series of issues of colonial notes by the separate Colonies The history of the disasters accompanying and following such issues would of itself make a fair sizedpamphlet OUR FIRST BANKING PERIOD The first epoch then may start with the conception of the Colman Bank which really never got farther than that and which carries us back to the year 1715 The Land Bank organized in 1739 had back of it no capital but did business upon mortgages given upon their estates by the stockholders Its failure need hardly be told and the suffering it entailed upon the stockholders and the public was a matter of notoriety down to the time of the Revolution The Specie Bank while its name was a good one proved largely because it never had but a trifle of specie a failure and wound up its affairs so quickly that it has not left much of an impression upon the early financial history of the colonies OUR SECOND BANKING PERIOD The second epoch begins then with the Bank of North America and properly ends it seems to me in 1838 when the State of New York established the idea for the first time in any systematic way in the history of the world of securing circulating notes by the deposit of collateral The Massa chusetts Bank was the next great bank historically speaking and it was chartered in 1784 and following this a bank was chartered in New York and another in Maryland In 1791 the first bank of the United States was chartered by Congress and its capital of i0ooooooo was partly made up of cash and partly in fact mainly of bonds of the United States It is likely that by the year 1812 there were as many as 125 banks in the United States in more or less active operation though no perfectly accurate statement in this matter can be now made The cardinal weakness in the banking of this 560AMErRICAN BANKING 33 second epoch was the lack of security for the noteholder and the total want of ordinary business prudence in maintaining proper specie reserves for the redemption of circulating notes so that the general suspension of specie payments in 1814 which however did not include the New England banks was in no way surprising The charter of the first bank of the United States expired in i81 i In i8i6 the second bank of the United States was chartered and it began business with the opening of the year 1817 and had a capital of 35000000 the Government taking 7ooo000 of its stock On starting it had less than 2000000 of specie the balance consisting of bonds stocks and the notes given to it by its stockholders in payment for their subscriptions to its capital This bank had a checkered existence was part of the time insolvent but ran along until its charter expired in 1836 in a kind of hap hazard reckless manner and those who read its history now can scarcely decide whether its capital was oftener employed in business or in politics It never actually failed as it was merged into The Bank of the United States chartered by the State of Pennsylvania This last bank failed most disas trously and when it suspended in October 1839 a large share of its stock was found to be owned in England while its management was wholly American and savored more of speculation than business When it finally and forever closed its doors in February 1841 it left behind it an odor of rascality and incompetence which lasted for a generation The history of banking in the several States during this second epoch reads like a romance and no portion of the polit ical history of the country is more interesting as it covers the entire period of the struggle between the Bank of the United States and the Whigs on one side and President Jackson and the Democratic party on the other During this epoch the gold dollar of the United States was established while Mr Jackson was in office at twentythree and onefifth grains 2320 grains of fine gold The great Democratic battle for honest money was won during this same period and it is back to the history of this great fight we turn when as Democrats 56134 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY we contend for an honest dollar It is well to remember that since 1873 nothing in the United States can be called an honest dollar which is not promptly convertible into a gold dollar of 2320 fine or its equivalent THE THIRD PERIOD IN AMERICAN BANKING The third epoch in American banking begins with the passage by the New York Legislature in 1838 of a bill requiring the securing of bank notes by the deposit of stock This marks the greatest change in our banking history It revolutionized the theory and practice of banking not only in America but in England for in 1844 the English Bank Act practically established the same idea and to this day Great Britain has shown no disposition to depart from it From 1838 on New York has had an admirable banking system and while her banks have been carried down into temporary suspension by the recklessness of methods West and South noteholders have in the end realized full value for notes regularly issued in New York after the year 1838 If other States had followed the example of the State of New York the wild and furious periods of speculation which culminated in the suspension of 1857 and which we so quickly overcame would have been avoided and our finan cial history in the fifties would not be clouded with the  wildcat reddog stumptail coonbox  bills which few remember much about in any accurate way but which exist in a kind of indefinite cobweb of recollections only to produce frequent spasms of financial nightmare during political campaigns THE FOURTH CHAPTER IN AMERICAN BANKING The national banking system which begins the fourth epoch in our banking history began in 1863 but properly speaking it should date from 1865 when the ten per cent tax upon State bank circulation forced all banks of issue into the national system Just here we must not fail to remember that at this time 1865 there was practically no such thing as wildcat money and the State bank notes and State 562AMERICAN BANKING 35 banks themselves were so popular and had such a strong hold upon the business public and were in such high favor with the people that it required the most enormous rate of taxation ever known in history and the most arbitrary com mercial law ever passed by Congress to force the notes of State banks out of circulation In this connection too it is a most significant fact that out of the great sum of 150 oooooo of State bank notes in circulation practically all of it was redeemed in full and without entailing loss upon the holders A still more striking commentary upon the excel lence of State banknote circulation is the fact that for years after the passage of the National Bank Act the notes of a number of State banks were worth far more than those of any national bank You could buy with one dollar of State bank money as high as two dollars and even two dollars and eighty cents in national bank notes in 1864 In fact from 1861 on until they entirely disappeared from circulation the notes of a number of State banks were always very much more valuable than the legaltender notes of the United States This is espe cially worthy of mention when the ignorant the hasty and the prejudiced cry out against all bank notes issued under State authority The national banking system had little that was novel in it practically nothing which was not fully known to every one familiar with the banking systems of New York Ohio and Indiana It consisted of the issue of notes by banks incor porated by the United States all of which bore the guaranty of the United States government bonds being lodged with the United States as collateral security This system of banking has been eminently satisfactory and extremely useful to the public and was of great advantage in raising and maintaining the public credit between 1863 and i866 The chances are that if Government bonds were in abund ant supply now that the most trifling changes in the system would be needed to render it continuously satisfactory to the nation As it is however the rapidly decreasing supply of United States bonds their high price and the low interest 563136 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY return they give the banks all point to the extinction of banknote circulation in 1907 and its gradual and yet rapid reduction meanwhile We are therefore close to the end of the fourth epoch in American banking and may properly consider what should be and what is likely to be the fifth OUR BANKING FUTURE In entering upon this subject it is necessary I think to lay down some general principles controlling the currency and the relation of our National Government to it before present ing a plan which will provide for the establishment of these principles and upon them erect a banking system which will enable us to forecast what the money supply of the future is likely to be I accept it as a fixed principle that we can only have at any one time a single standard of value and need not stop to argue the matter with such an audience as this is addressed to We must choose between gold the standard of enlight ened nations like England Germany and France or silver the standard of Mexico South America China Africa and for the present India I assume that we shall decide per manently in favor of the Democratic gold dollar 2320 grains fine as the ultimate standard of the United States We are justified in this by the action of Congress last winter on the free coinage of silver and its present attitude in connection with the crazy speculation in bar silver which has gone on since 1878 under the Bland bill of 1878 and the Act of 1890 so often called the Sherman bill but unjustly so as it never at any time reflected the views of Mr Sherman except as a compromise measure Considering it settled then that gold and gold alone is to be the permanent as it has been since 1873 the sole legal standard of value in the United States it follows that all other forms of money whether of paper or coin must always be kept at par with gold and be promptly redeemable in it The next principle to be recognized is that the issuing of promises to pay by the United States intended to circulate 5641AMERICAN BANKING 37 as money is improper never should have been adopted has cost us directly and indirectly half as much as the war of the rebellion and is today the cause of our having in the treasury over 416oooooo ounces of silver which has cost the nation over 8ooooooo more than its present market value and probably over 2oooooooo more than we shall ever realize for it Just how the present legal tender paper circulation of the United States shall be recalled and paid off and the Govern ment got back to where its financial functions will be limited to the collection of money by taxation and its disbursement for legitimate national expenses this is not the place to speculate upon nor this the time to make recommendations Suffice it to say the Governments sole relation to business and its only connection with the money market and the sup ply of currency should consist in controlling wisely and honestly the coinage and its functions here should be limited to the easy task of coining without limit gold which is our standard of value and in limiting the coinage of silver to the sum which experience shows we can use and which will not vary much from one standard silver dollar for each soul in the country The great curse to business as well as the principal draw back to enterprise during the last thirty yearsexcept of course the war from i861 to 1865 and our ignorant and selfish tariff systemhas been the control of Congress over the volume and the value of the money supply of the country A COMMONPLACE BUT MOST EFFICIENT BANKING SYSTEM Accepting the few cardinal strikingly simple and mani festly wholesome principles just stated the bill quoted below and known as  H R No 9770 presents a solution for the financial questions which will then remain to be settled and if once made the law of the United States will require little change or alteration afterward Under the operation of a law like this business would be independent of Congress and the supply of money in the United States would at all times 56538 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY be ample and also automatic and it would therefore be marked by an elasticity and flexibility in volume which it has been a stranger to ever since the Government began to interfere with and control our money market as it did on the outbreaking of the Civil War in 1861 Little explanation of the provisions in the bill will be needed by even the least professional or practical reader and it is submitted without further comment except that which follows it and which is confined to answering the objections made to it in some quarters It may be proper to remark that with the Government confining itself to its legitimate duties it is quite clear that under this law the currency of the United States would consist of gold and of national and State bank notes all promptly redeemable in gold and of silver nickel and copper coins for making change 52D CONGRMsS H R 9770 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES DECEMBER 7 1892 Referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency and ordered to be printed A BILL To provide for the issue of circulating notes of National and State banking associations upon securities other than United States bonds for the taxation of the circulating notes of National banks and for other purposes Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled That the United States shall not hereafter guarantee the payment of circulating notes issued by any bank banking association or private banker SEC 2 That there shall be no limit to the amount of circulating notes which any national banking association may issue except that such notes shall at no time exceed ninety per centum of the par value of the bonds deposited to secure the same by such association SEC 3 That every national banking association after the same has been fully organized may at all times have on hand in the custody of the Comptroller of the Currency such amount of its circulating notes ready for issue upon the deposit of the securities as hereinafter 566AMERICAN BANKING 39 provided with the Treasurer of the United States as shall not at any time exceed the par value of its paidup capital stock SIc 4 That State banks State banking associations and bankers expressly authorized under State statute to issue circulating notes shall pay no Federal or United States tax upon such notes Provided That all such notes are secured in the same manner and to the same extent as the notes of national banks that is by bonds of the precise char acter described in this bill which bonds must be duly deposited with a properly designated State officer in the State in which the issuing bank banking association or banker is domiciled  and every national banking association shall pay a tax upon the circulating notes issued by it and in circulation at the rate of onefifth of one per centum per annum upon the average amount of the same not exceeding ninety per centum of the capital stock actually paid up in cash one per centum per annum upon the average amount of such notes in excess of ninety per centum and not exceeding one hundred and eighty per centum of the said capital and ten per centum upon the average amount of such notes in excess of one hundred aud eighty per centum of said capital Such taxes shall be payable semiannually and shall be collected by the internal revenue collectors of the United States SEc 5 That in addition to the United States bonds now required by law to be deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to secure the circulating notes of national banking associations the Comptroller of the Currency is hereby authorized and required to accept registered bonds issued by any railroad corporation or city in the United States and deposit the same with the Treasurer of the United States in behalf of any such association as security for its cir culating notes subject to the following restrictions  FirstThe principal and interest of all such bonds shall in ex pressed terms be payable in gold coin of the United States SecondAll such bonds must have been continuously listed upon some regular stock exchange located in a city of the United States having a population of not less than five hundred thousand for at least five years ThirdNo bond shall be accepted upon which payment of interest has at any time been in default or which at any time within three years prior to the date of its offer for acceptance has sold publicly upon any stock exchange where it was listed for less than one hundred and five cents on the dollar of its face value FourthNo bond shall be accepted if the total tax levy of the city issuing it exceeds two per centum per annum FifthNo railroad bond not regularly secured by mortgage upon the roadbed and track shall be accepted 56740 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SixthNo association shall be permitted to have more than twenty per centum of its bonds on deposit of the issue of any one railroad corporation or city Sevenlh Whenever any class of bonds on deposit has been pub licly sold below par for a period of thirty days upon any stock exchange where listed the Comptroller shall require a bond to be substituted which will in all respects meet the requirements of this act EighthWhenever any railroad corporation which was paying dividends upon its stock when its bonds were accepted by the Comp troller ceases to pay dividends the substitution of other and proper bonds shall be required SEc 6 That the Comptroller with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury shall have the right to reject any class of bonds he sees fit and to require proper substitution for any already on deposit con sidered undesirable SEc 7 That no association shall hereafter be required to keep on deposit with the Treasurer of the United States any further security or fund for the payment of its circulating notes than those provided for and required by this act SEc 8 That any president vicepresident manager secretary treasurer or other officer of any interstate railroad who shall know ingly issue or permit to be issued any false statement of the earnings expenses or condition of the road he is officially connected with shall be subject to indictment and trial in any court of the United States and if found guilty shall be imprisoned at hard labor for not less than ten years nor more than twenty years and be subject to a fine in addition of not more than one hundred thousand dollars SEc 9 That for the further protection of the holders of circulating notes the United States shall have a first lien upon the assets of each national banking association for the payment of its notes in addition to the bonds deposited with the Treasurer of the United States as security SEC Io That a fund of one million dollars shall be created out of the taxes collected under this act from national banking associations and shall be maintained from the same source and if the proceeds of the bonds deposited to secure the circulating notes of an association and the first lien upon its assets together are insufficient to redeem the outstanding notes of the association then the deficiency shall be made good from this fund SEc II That the notes of no national banking association shall be a legal tender in payment of any claim due to the United States and when a national banking association has been placed in the hands of a receiver its circulating notes shall cease to be received in payment of any obligation due and payable to the United States 568AMERICAN BANKING 41 SUc 12 That all parts of existing laws which are in conflict or inconsistent with the provisions of this act shall be and hereby are repealed OBJECTIONS CONSIDERED The first objection made to the bill is that the notes would be open to the cry of  wildcat  due to insufficient security This falls to the ground when it is found that no notes of any bank in the world except possibly those of our national banks whose present security must disappear with the pay ment of the debt of the United States are as amply secured The notes of the Canadian banks so justly esteemed have no such security behind them those of the Bank of France have no special security  those of the Reichsbank of Ger many and the other thirteen banks of issue have none until their volume exceeds 385000000 marks 9163oooo The security provided by this bill for all notes State and national would be on an average measured at all times by gold twenty per cent greater than that pledged for the notes of the Bank of England The market value in gold of the security proposed and which would be behind the notes of even the most remote or inaccessible bank would be about double the average gold value of the security which was behind our national bank notesin the shape of United States bondsfrom 1863 to 1865 It hardly seems necessary to say more in this connection except to remark that you will notice it does away with the improper use of the Govern ment guaranty upon circulating notes which is as useless on a properly secured bill as it has always been improper One thing more however If the notes of all banks in the United States had been so secured ever since railroading and modern business methods made it possible no holder of a note State or national in all this period would ever have lost a farthing  If this had been the law in I86o it is hardly necessary to say the war might have been carried on upon a gold basis not a dollar of legaltender paper need have been issued and the direct cost of the struggle would have been cut almost in two and if this had been the 56942 ANNAIS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY law we would have avoided that constant interference of the Congress of the United States with the volume of the currency which has kept the business of the country at sixes and sevens most of the time since 1866 Again if this had been the law the United States would not be the unhappy owner of silver costing over 429oooooo for all of which it owes its notes all practically payable in gold while not except by a miracle could it get 200000000 for this load of pig metal We should have been saved a loss of say 225oooooo yet to be made up by taxing the people for all of this would have been avoided had this simple safe equitable and efficient bill been the law of the United States The next criticism is that it would provoke counterfeiting and give us too great a variety of paper money To this I answer that counterfeiting in 1865 had dwindled to a point where it was an unimportant feature notwithstanding the great variety of bills in circulation Since 1865 we have wonderfully improved our bank note engraving and we are so superior in this direction to Europe where they suffer little from counterfeiting even with their poorly executed notes that we need borrow no trouble on this score Again learning from the practice of the United States it is likely that each State would have one form of note and every State and all of its banks would be constantly on the lookout for and quick in the punishment of counterfeiting While the law provides as it should and as any fair just measure must for State bank circulation in the end it is prob able that our paper circulation under this law would be mainly perhdps exclusively that of national banks because with the rate of tax placed on circulation by the bill capital would find it more profitable to organize under the national than under any State bank system  for few if any States could meet the expenses attending a local system without taxing the circulation of their own banks more than the United States need that of the national banks Add the undoubted fact that national banks would enjoy a higher general credit than State banks and we see that the passage 570AMERICAN BANKING 43 of this law after the United States had retired its paper promises to pay would result in the simplification of our paper currency and still further remove it from the dangers of counterfeiting And speaking of counterfeiting the real present and future great danger of counterfeiting is found in our silver dollar for any fairly expert mechanic can make a silver dollar in all respects in weight fineness and appearance equal to the United States standard dollar for not over sixtysix cents today If we go on cheapening the cost of turning out silver he will be able to make a dollar very much cheaper Today it is probable that the actual cost of a spurious silver dollar to some of the Creede Colo rado miners would not be over eighteen to twenty cents while some Colorado miners could produce silver dollars as heavy of as pure material and quite as perfect otherwise as the United States standard dollar at not over eleven cents each The charge made that notes issued under this bill would prove objectionable on account of inconvenience in their not being current everywhere or that domestic exchange would rise in consequence becomes so very baseless when we remember that to have even local or if you will a purely home circulation would require them to be kept there at par with other money that I dismiss it rather than take your time to answer it A PREDICTION Finally I make the prediction with confidence that within fifteen years after this bill becomes the law of the United States its leading features will be adopted by a number of other nations and that inside of a half century it will practically be the banking law of the commercial world and that long before that if we continue to keep gold as our sole standard of value the world will discard the clumsy pound sterling as its measure of value in international trade and that the2320 grains fine gold dollar of the United States of America will be the basis upon which the trade of the world at large will be conducted 57144 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY I crave for the evident lack of care in the preparation of this article the indulgence of those who read it and enter the plea of justification inasmuch as it was written when crowded day and night with public duties which I could not put aside MICHAEL D HARTUR House of Representatives

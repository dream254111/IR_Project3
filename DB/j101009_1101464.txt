LIENS DISCUSSED IN THIS PAPER WERE UNKNOWN EITHER AT COM MON LAW OR IN EQUITY AND ARE MERE CREATURES OF STATUTE THEY ARE OF COMPARATIVELY RECENT ORIGIN AND OWE THEIR CREATION AS DO ALL STATUTORY ENACTMENTS TO THE NECESSITY FOR LAWS THAT WILL BETTER MEET NEW AND CHANGING CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY IS THIS TRUE IN A COMPARATIVELY NEW COUNTRY SUCH AS OURS WHERE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE VAST NATURAL RESOURCES REQUIRES THE ASSISTANCE OF FRIENDLY LEGISLATION AS WELL AS THE EFFORTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SO WE FIND IN MINING STATES LIENS GIVEN TO MINERS AND OTHERS UPON THE MINES AND THEIR PRODUCTS IN STATES WHERE LUMBERING IS A LARGE AND IMPORTANT INDUSTRY LUMBERMEN ARE PROTECTED BY LIENS AND THE TENDENCY OF MODERN LEGISLATION WE ARE TOLD BY THE AUTHOR OF JONES ON LIENS IS TO EXTEND STILL FURTHER THIS REMEDY FOR THE PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO FURNISH LABOR AND SUPPLY MATERIALS FOR OTHERS PROBABLY THE MOST CHARACTERISTIC FEATURE OF THESE STATUTES IS THAT THE LIEN GIVEN IS PARAMOUNT TO ALL OTHER LIENS ON THE GROUND DOUBT LESS THAT THE LABOR EXPENDED IN MINING COAL OR IN CUTTING TIMBER INCREASES THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCT FOR THE BENEFIT OF ALL PARTIES WHO MAY HAVE AN INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY WHETHER SUCH PERSONS BE LIENORS SECURED BY DEEDS OF TRUST EXECUTED PRIOR OR SUBSEQUENT TO THE PERFORMALNCE OF THE LABOR OR CLAIMANTS UNDER OTHER LIENS CERTAINLY LEGISLATION OF THIS CHARACTER WILL IN SOME CASES WORK A HARDSHIP TO THE CORPORATIONS AFFECTED BUT IT IS ALSO A SOURCE OF BENEFIT TO THEM FOR IT INSURES EASY CREDIT WITH THOSE HAVING SUP PLIES FOR SALE AND A STEADY FORCE OF EMPLOYEES WHO ARE WILLING TO FURNISH THEIR LABOR KNOWING THAT THEY ARE PROTECTED AND WILL BE PAID THE REWARD FOR THEIR LABOR THE VIEW OF THE SUPREME COURT178 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JULY OF OUR STATE OF THESE LIENS HAS BEEN STATED IN THE CASE OF MILLHISER MFG CO V GALLEGO MILLS CO AS FOLLOWS  WHILE IT IS DOUBTLESS TRUE AS CLAIMED IN THE ARGUMENT OF THE CASE FOR APPEL LANTS THAT IN THE ENACTMENT OF THE LABOR AND SUPPLY LIEN STATUTE UNDER CONSIDERA TION THE LEGISLATURE HAD IN VIEW THE TWOFOLD PURPOSE FIRST TO  INCREASE THE INDUSTRIES OF THE STATE DEVELOP ITS RESOURCES AND ADD TO ITS WEALTH AND PROS PERITY BY FOSTERING AND ENCOURAGING CORPORATE ENTERPRISES AND AFFORDING PRO DUAING COMPANIES A SOURCE OF CREDIT WHEREBY THEY MIGHT OBTAIN THE LABOR AND RAW MIATERIAL NECESSARY TO THE OPERATION OF THEIR PLANTS WITLHOUT WHICH LABOR AND SUPPLIES SUCLH COMPANIES WOUILD BE UNABLE TO COMMENCE THEIR OPERATIONS AND SECOND TO GUARD PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS WHLO SHOULD BE WILLING TO FURNISH THEIR SUPPLIES ON CREDIT  TLE COURT HOWEVER PRO CEEDING IMMEDIATELY TO SAY THAT A CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATUTE WOULD BE DISASTROUS AT ONCE TO THE LABORER THE SUPPLY MAN THE MANUFACTURER AND OTHERS CONDUCTING INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISES IN THIS STATE ALIKE WHICH WOULD ALLOW A SUPPLY MAN TO FILE HIS CLAIM AFTER THE TITLE TO THE PROPERTY HAS PASSED TO A PURCHASER OR A LENDER OF MONEY TO A

THE BUSINESS TO BE TRANSACTED ETC IF THE CORPORA TION CAN DEFEAT ONE OF TH SE PROVISIONS WHY NOT ALL IF IT CAN CHANGE ITS CHIEF OFFICE WHY NOT THE NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS AND THE AMOUNT OF ITS STOCK IN

EXISTENCE OF A CORPORATION THAT THE PLACE OF ITS PRIN CIPAL OFFICE SHOULD BE FIXED OR EVEN THAT IT SHOULD HAVE ANY SUCLH OFFICE WE CAN HOWEVER SEE OBVIOUS REASONS WHY IT IS EXPEDIELNT THAT CORPORATIONS SHOULD BE DEEMED TO HAVE A LOCATION FOR CERTAIN PURPOSES AMONG WHICH IS THAT OF TAXATION AND THAT THIS SHOULD BE DEFINITE AND CERTAIN AND NOT SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION OR DOUBT WHEN THE

THE KIND DESCRIBED IN THE STATUTE IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE FAILURE OF THE GREATEST MANUFACTURING COMPANY IN THIS STATE WAS HASTENED IF NOT CAUSED BY THIS STATUTE THE BANKS BEING ADVISED BY COUNSEL THAT THEY COULD NOT SAFELY LEND IT MONEY TO TIDE OVER A CRISIS IN ITS AFFAIRS IT IS ALSO WELL KNOWN THAT OTHER INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS ARE TODAY KNOCKING AT THE DOORS OF THE BANKS FOR MONEY WHICH WOULD BE PROMPTLY LENT THEM BUT FOR THIS ACT BUT ARE TOLD THAT THEY MUST SEEK THEIR CREDIT WITH THE FOREIGN SUPPLY IIIAN WHOM OUR LAWS PROTECT RATHER THAN FROM A HOME BANK WHICH CAN OBTAIN AT BEST ONLY A SECOND LIEN IT WILL BE SEEN AT ONCE THAT IT IS NOT THE BANKS BUT THE INDUSTRIAL CORPORATIONS WHICH ARE MORE INTERESTED THAN ANY OTHERS IN THE AMENDMENT OF THIS SINGLE FEATURE OF THE LAWA

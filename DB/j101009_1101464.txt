liens discussed in this paper were unknown either at com mon law or in equity and are mere creatures of statute They are of comparatively recent origin and owe their creation as do all statutory enactments to the necessity for laws that will better meet new and changing conditions Particularly is this true in a comparatively new country such as ours where the development of the vast natural resources requires the assistance of friendly legislation as well as the efforts of the individual So we find in mining states liens given to miners and others upon the mines and their products in states where lumbering is a large and important industry lumbermen are protected by liens and the tendency of modern legislation we are told by the author of Jones on Liens is to extend still further this remedy for the protection of those who furnish labor and supply materials for others Probably the most characteristic feature of these statutes is that the lien given is paramount to all other liens on the ground doubt less that the labor expended in mining coal or in cutting timber increases the value of the product for the benefit of all parties who may have an interest in the property whether such persons be lienors secured by deeds of trust executed prior or subsequent to the performalnce of the labor or claimants under other liens Certainly legislation of this character will in some cases work a hardship to the corporations affected but it is also a source of benefit to them for it insures easy credit with those having sup plies for sale and a steady force of employees who are willing to furnish their labor knowing that they are protected and will be paid the reward for their labor The view of the Supreme Court178 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July of our State of these liens has been stated in the case of Millhiser Mfg Co v Gallego Mills Co as follows  While it is doubtless true as claimed in the argument of the case for appel lants that in the enactment of the labor and supply lien statute under considera tion the legislature had in view the twofold purpose First to  increase the industries of the State develop its resources and add to its wealth and pros perity by fostering and encouraging corporate enterprises and affording pro duAing companies a source of credit whereby they might obtain the labor and raw miaterial necessary to the operation of their plants witlhout which labor and supplies suclh companies wouild be unable to commence their operations and second to guard property rights of other individuals and corporations whlo should be willing to furnish their supplies on credit  tle court however pro ceeding immediately to say that a construction of the statute would be disastrous at once to the laborer the supply man the manufacturer and others conducting industrial enterprises in this state alike which would allow a supply man to file his claim after the title to the property has passed to a purchaser or a lender of money to a manufacturing company and permit the claim thus filed to reach back and take from the purchaser or lender of money property that has already become hiis IIISTORY OF THE LIEN IN THIS STATE The first statute of the cbaracter treated of in this article had its origin in the act of March 21 1877 Acts 18767 p 188 and was entitled An act to secure the payment of wages or salaries to certain employees of railway canal steamboat and other trans portation companies The act itself provided for the protection of employees of transportation companies and for those who fur niished supplies to such companies by giving them a prior lien on the franchise gross earnings and the real and personal property of such companies The act being broader than its title and there fore in conflict with Art V section 15 of the Constitution the Supreme Court of Virginia in the case of Fidelity etc Co v Shenandoah Valley R R Co held the statute to be unconstitu tional in so far as it attempted to give a lien to those furnishing supplies to such companies On April 2 1879 this original act was amended Acts 18789 pp 3523 the purpose of the amend ment being to enlarge the class of supplies for which the lien was to he given and to extend the lien to those furnishing supplies and labor to mining and manufacturing companies and the lien was to take priority over any deed of trust mortgage etc thereafter ex ecuted The title to the amendment remaining as in the original act the act of April 1879 suffered the same fate as the act it 19V L R 161 2S6Va 11903 STATUTORY SUPPLY AND LABOR LIENS 179 amended In the case of Crowther v Fidelity etc Co U S Cir Ct App3 a suit in which the Shenandoah Iron Companys assets were distributed the court held the amendment to be unconstitu tional so far as it undertook to protect those furnishing supplies or labor to mining and manufacturing companies the title not embracing such lienors and further that uinder the doctrine of ejusdem generis such corporations were not within the title of the act Neither of these cases having been decided prior to 1888 and the legislature not doubting their constitutionality no changes were made until the Revisors of the Code made some slight alterations and in this altered form they were put into the Code of 1887 sees 24857 The law at present is to be found in sections 2485 and 2486 of Pollards Supplement to the Code section 2485 having been amended by Acts 18912 p 000 and section 2486 by Acts 18956 p 340 and are as follows Sec 2485 Liens of employees and so forth on transportation companies and so forth on franchises and property of companyAll conductors brakesmen enginedrivers firemen captains stewards pilots clerks depot or office agents storekeepers mechanics or laborers and all persons furnishing railroad iron engines cars fuel and all other supplies necessary to the operation of any rail way canal or other transportation company and all clerks mechanics and laborers who furnish their services or labor to any mining or manufacturing company whether such railway canal or other transportation or mining or manufacturing company be chartered under or by the laws of this State or be chartered elsewhere and be doing business within the limits of this State shall have a prior lien on tlle franchises gross earnings and on all the real and per sonal property of said company which is used in operating the same to the extent of the monevs due them by said company for such wages or supplies and no mortgage deed of trust sale hypothecation or conveyance executed since the twentyfirst day of March eighteen hundred and seventyseven shall defeat or take precedence over said lien and all persons furnishing supplies to a mining or manufacturlng company necessary to the operation of the same shall have a prior lien upon the personal pr operty of such company other than that forming part of its plant to the extent of the money due them for such supplies and also a lien upon all the estate real and personal of such company which said last lien however upon all such real and personal estate shall be subject and inferior to any lien by deed of trust mortgage hypothecation sale or convey ance made or executed and duly admitted to record prior to the date at which said supplies are furnished provided however that the lien secured by this provision to parties furnishing supplies shall be subsequent to that due to clerks mechanics and laborers for services furnished as aforesaid and provided that 3V L R 867180 9 VIRG1INIA LAW REGISTER July if any person entitled to a lien as well under section twentyfour hundred and seventyfive as under this section shall perfect his lien given by either section he shall not be entitled to the benefit of the other and provided also that no right to or remedy upon a lien which has already accrued to any person shall be extended abridged or otherwise affected hereby Sec 2486 No person shall be entitled to the lien given by the preceding section unless he shall within ninety days after the last item of his bill becomes due and payable for which such supplies are furnished or service rendered file in the clerks office of the court of the county or corporation in which is located the chief office in this State of the company against which the claim is or in the clerks office of the chancery court of the city of Richmond when such office is in said city a memorandum of the amount and consideration of his claim verified by affidavit which memorandum the said clerk shall forthwith record in the deed book and index the same in the name of the said claimant and also in the name of the company against which the claim is Any such lien may be enforced in a court of equity Code of 1887 sec 2487 Assignees rights Any assignee of such claim may file the memorandum and make the oath required by the preceding section and shall have the same rights as his assignor These statutes have also been assailed as unconstitutional the attack being made upon the grounds that this character of legis lation is unequal and partial that it is special and class legis lation and in conflict with the 14th Amendment In Va Dev Co v Crozier Iron Co4 in which these questions were presented the court upheld the constitutionality of the statutes and the law ma y now be considered as settled beyond criticism Any discussion of these statutes would naturally lead to the arrangement of the subject under the following lheads 1 Against whom and byr whom may the lien be claimed 2 The property bound ly the lien 3 How perfected 4 When and where the memorandum is to be filel 5 What are labor and supplies 1 Against whom anid by whon may the lient be clatinedThe lien may be asserted only against railway canal or other transpor tation companies and mining and manufacturing companies Those who may take advantage of this lien for latbor arc a Conductors brakemiien engine drivers firemen captains stewards pilots clerks lepot or office agents storekeepers me chanics or laborers in the employ of a railway or other transporta tion comnDanv 4 90 Va 1261903 STATUTORY SUPPLY AND LABOR LIENS 181 b Clerks mechanics and laborers who furnish their services to any mining and manufacturing company doing business in this state whether chartered here or elsewhere Those who may claim the lien for supplies c All persons furnishing railroad iron engines cars fuel and all other supplies necessary to the operation of any railway or other transportation company d All persons furnishing supplies necessary to the operation of any mining or manufacturing company e Any assignee of any of these may file his claim and have the same rights as his assignor 2 The property bound by the lienThe lienors a b and c have a prior lien upon the franchises gross earnings and on all the real and personal property of the debtor company used in the operation of the said company and superior to any deed of trust sale mortgage etc executed since Mlarch 21 1877 However under the decision in Crowther v Fidelity etc Co supra a deed of trust executed prior to Mlay 1 1888 would take priority over any claim except for labor furnished a transportation company neither of the two acts in force before that time being constitutional except in the particular mentioned The lienors d are entitled to a prior lien upon the personal property of such mining or manufacturing company other than that forming part of its plant but subsequent to the lien of any clerk mechanic or laborer and a further lien such as is given lienors a b and c which last lien however is inferior to any deed of trust mortgage etc executed and admitted to record prior to the date at which supplies are furnished It may be well to point out just here that in the latter case the supply lienor can claim priority up to the time of the recordation of the deed of trust etc so if the supplies are furnished on a run ning account from June 1st to January 1st and the deed of trust is recorded December 1st the supply lienor can claim priority only for supplies furnished to December 1st 3 How perfectedHaving seen who is protected by these stat utes and what is bound by these liens let us see what are the essen tial averments of the memorandum and how the memorandum is filed The highest court of our state has held that the statutes are182 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July remedial and therefore should be liberally construed5 and in Over hoit v Old Dominiont Co6 adopting in its opinion a note to the case of Liberty P B  L Co v Furbush prepared by the late Mr Kean held that the statute had been complied with when the memorancdum showed the following 1 The amiount of the claim 2 The consideration i e whether for labor or supplies 3 The verification of the account by affidavit The account may be sworn to by anyone who is familiar with the facts Beumit v Hfatcher8a case of attachment of real estate This liberal construction of these statutes by the Supreme Court of our State in the Overholt case is opposed bv the ruling of the U S Circuit Court of Appeals in the case of Liberty etc Co v Furbush supra decided about three years before the Overholt case In the Furbush case the court held that the memorandum filed should show the existence of all the facts contemplated by the statute that these facts must be set forth in the memorandum 1 The amount 2 The consideration 3 That the services were rendered or the supplies furnished within 90 days after the filing of the rmemorandum and 4 That the memorandum be verified by affidavit And the court goes on to say that the better practice would be for the memorandum to show further a That the company against which the lien is claimed is a transportation company or mining or manufacturing company b That the laborers clerks etc were employed as laborers clerks etc by that company and c A brief description of the property real and personal of the said company This difference of construction between the state and federal courts should be borne in mind in filing memorandums against foreign corporations doing business in this state for while as a general proposition the federal courts are supposed to adopt the in terpretation a state court has put upon a local statute the note of AIr Bryan in 8 V L R 443 shows plainly the danger of one rely ing too much upon this rule In such cases it would be decidedly safer to follow the Furbush case 5 Va Dev Co v Crozier Iron Co 90 Va 126 7 3 V L R 95 6 98 Va 654 8 81 Va 351903 STATUTORY SUPPLY AND LABOR LIENS 183 In the case of In Re lVest Norfolk Lunber Co Bankrupt 7 V L R 836 the question wvas raised the Furbush case being relied upon for the position taken that the memorandum failed to show on its face that it was filed within the time prescribed by statute The court held that as the affidavit contained the statement that such time had not elapsed the affidavit could be referred to for the purpose of giving the information required by the statute 4 When and where the memorandumn to be filed It must be filed within ninety days after the last item of the account became due and payable and an order of reference for the ascertainment of the debts due by an insolvent corporation will suspend the run ning of the statute Fidelity etc Co v Roanoke 1 Co 9 Seventh Natl Bank v Shenandoah I Co09 When the claim is filed the lien secured relates back to the time the labor or supplies were fur nished subject to be defeated bv prior or intervening liens In re West Norfolk L Co This case is also authority for the proposi tion that the memorandum need not show what part of the debt asserted is actually and what part is to become due It must be filed in the clerks office of the county or corporation in which is located the chief office of the corporation debtor and the liens take priority in the order of recordation Va Dev Co v Crozier supra In a case recently decided by one of the nisi prius courts the question of wlhere the memorandum should be filed arose in this way the charter required the chief office to be in Lynch burg but this provision had never been complied with the office being somewhere else The court held that the situs of the chief office was a question of fact to be ascertained by proof and not to be settled conclusively by an inspeetion of the charter But section 1145 of the Code as well as the act concerning corporations re cently passed requires the petition for incorporation to set forth the location of the principal office the amount of the capital stock the character of the business to be transacted etc If the corpora tion can defeat one of th se provisions why not all If it can change its chief office why not the nature of its business and the amount of its stock In a New York case in which a somewhat similar question came before the court it was said Unless the legislature intended that the certificate should be conclusive as to the location of the principal office it is difficult to see any adequate 9 81 Fed 453 11 7 V L R 836 10 35 Fed 443184 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July motive for requiring the statement to be miiade It is in no manner essential to the existence of a corporation that the place of its prin cipal office should be fixed or even that it should have any suclh office We can however see obvious reasons why it is expedielnt that corporations should be deemed to have a location for certain purposes among which is that of taxation and that this should be definite and certain and not subject to fluctuation or doubt When the question is left open to parol proof serious difficulties and embarrassments must often arise W4estern Transportation Co v Scheut12 The lien may be enforced in a court of equity but there is no time limit after the filing of the memorandum within which the suit nmust be instituted The lien may no doubt be lost just as a mechanics lien is i e by estoppel or by waiver If the party has already taken advantage of sections 2575 et seq he cannot have the benefit of sections 24856 and 2487 5 ll hat are labor and suppliesIn Farinholt v Luckland3 the term laboring man as used in the homestead exemption laws was defined when used in its ordinary and usual acceptation to carry with it the idea of physical and manual exertion or toil and is used to denote that class of persons who literallv earn their bread by the sweat of their brows and who perform with their own lhanlds at the cost of considerable physical labor the contracts made with their employers And in Fidelity etc Co v Roanokce Iron Co4 it was held that the manager and the secretary and treasurer of an iron company were neither entitled to a lien for services these being officers and not laborers within the statute As to what constitutes supplies the decisions in this state are few It has been held however that they are niecessaries collected and held for distribution and use a very broad definition In the same case Boston Blower Co v Carmnani L Co an apparatus for kiln dryingr lumber was held not to be supplies within the meaning of thle statute So a transportation company could not claim a statutory lien for freight on supplies shipped to a manufacturing company Fidelity etc Co v Roanoke etc Co supra Pigr iron ore and coal lhave been held to be supplies necessary to the operation of an 12 19 N Y 410 14 81 Fed 453 190 Va 936 1594 Va 991903 STATUTORY SUPPLY AND LABOR LIENS 185 iron manufacturing company Va Dev Co v Crozier supra but goods furnished an iron company and used in conducting a com missary not to be sulch supplies as were necessary to the operation of the same and the lien was denied Fidelity etc Co v Roanoke ctc Co sup ra Where supplies are furnished and they are necessary to the con duct of the manufacturing company it is not necessary to show that they were actually so used In the matter of The lWest Nor folk L Co supra A general manager was held in Seventth Nat Bank v Shenandoah Co supra not to be entitled to the lien During the last session of the General Assembly a bill was intro duced in the House of Delegates and passed by that body which had for its object the elimination of the supply man as a preferred creditor of mining and manufacturing companies Those who favor this measure maintain that when this bill is passed by the Senate banking credit at home will be more easily obtained This will no doubt be the result but just to the same extent that bank ing credit is facilitated credit with the supply men will be re stricted WVhether our law remains as it is or whether it is changed to conform with the House bill above referred to it is not believed that solvent corporations will have any difficulty either in securing supplies or in obtaining credit with the banks Lynchburg Va LEON GOODMAN EDITORIAL NOTEWe publish this article with the belief that it will prove useful to the profession as a summary of the congeries of carelessly drawn and in one particular unprecedented statutes on the one hand and on the other of certain hastily considered judgmentsnotably that of Virginia Electri cal Company v Crozier 90 Va 126 We cannot however endorse in any degree the principal statement in the last paragraph The position of the REGISTER upon the general subject is too well known see Volume VIII page 205 to necessitate a repetition of its views while upon the point in question a casual reading of the opinion of the Court of Appeals in Millhi8er Manufacturing Company v The Gallego Mills Company supra will show that its views of the present statute as a matter of legislative or state policy are not in harmony with those of Mr Goodman His closing statement is at the most only an opinion it is not believed From the standpoint of experience with the actual operation of the statute since its last amendment all who are acquainted with the subject know that the fact is distinctly opposed to this belief namelv that solvent mining and manufacturing corporations have had now have and will continue to have until the passage of the House Bill referred to or a similar measure the greatest difficulty in obtaining credit with the banks As another matter of fact the banks of this186 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER July state have been officially warned by the executive officers of their association against loaning any money whatever to corporations of the kind described in the statute It is well known that the failure of the greatest manufacturing company in this state was hastened if not caused by this statute the banks being advised by counsel that they could not safely lend it money to tide over a crisis in its affairs It is also well known that other industrial corporations are today knocking at the doors of the banks for money which would be promptly lent them but for this Act but are told that they must seek their credit with the foreign supply iiian whom our laws protect rather than from a home bank which can obtain at best only a second lien It will be seen at once that it is not the banks but the industrial corporations which are more interested than any others in the amendment of this single feature of the lawa statute to use a familiar word of Carlyle and Ruskin of the damnablest kind begotten of lulst for unjust preferences and secret liens enacted after insufficient consideration and working from the day of its birth only surprise dismay confusion and the destruction of equities that should obtain among parties equally entitled to share and share alike in the res or its proceeds

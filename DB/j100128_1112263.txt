blanks so as to make the instrument available for the purpose for which it was entrusted but has the additional right inasmuch as the filling in is of no effect until delivery to change what he has already inserted so that the instrument may conform to that purpose Douglass v Scott  Fry 1837 35 Va 43 In the principal case the insertion of the words or bearer was certainly made in order to secure the sale of the note which was the purpose contemplated by the defendants The fact that the instrument contained the words or order can hardly be considered inconsistent with an authority to make the instrument payable to bearer cf Neg Inst Law  9 3 and the circumstances on the whole seem to justify the inference that the maker was actually authorized to complete the note as he did CONSTITUTIONAL LAWAPPROPRIATIONS TO SECTARIAN SCHOOLSThe plaintiffs brought a bill to enjoin the payment of county funds to certain Catholic institutions for the maintenance of dependent children committed thereto by statutory provision Children of various faiths were sent to these institutions The Catholic catechism was taught to all but only Catholic children were required to attend the Catholic chapel Held since the proposed payment was less than the actual cost of maintaining the children it would not be a violation of a constitutional prohibition against payments of public funds in aid of any church or sectarian purpose Trost v Ketteler Manual Train ing School Ill 1918 118 N E 743 Most state constitutions provide in substance that no public funds shall be appropriated in aid of any sectarian

Gallitzin Borough 1894 164 Pa 652 30 Atl 480 As to what constitutes sectarian instruction there is a diversity of opinion By the great weight of authority reading the Bible in a public school without comment is not sectarian instruction Stevenson v Hanyon 1898 7 Pa Distr R 585 Church v Bullock Tex Sup Ct 1908 109 S W 115 contra State ex rel Weiss v District Board supra People ex rel Ring v Board

question arises whether an appropriation of less than the actual cost of maintaining the inmates constitutes aid or support within the meaning of the constitutional prohibition It has been held that any appropriation regardless of the amount or the rendition of services therefor is an aid to such a school County of Cook v Chicago Industrial School supra State ex rel Nevada Orphan Asylum v Hallock supra and a literal inter pretation would seem to sustain such a result But the Illinois courts influenced doubtless by the fact that these institutions are performing a duty which the state would otherwise have to perform at a greater 607COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW expense have held that appropriations to such schools of less than the actual cost of maintaining the children are not prohibited even though the school is controlled by a church Dunn v Addison Manual Training School 1907 281 Ill 352 117 N E 993 and sectarian instruction is given therein Dunn v Chicago Industrial School 1917 280 Ill 613 117 N E 735 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWINVALID CLAIMS AGAINST COUNTIESCURATIVE LEGISLATIONA Pennsylvania statute provided that whenever any county had heretofore entered into a contract for the construction of a public highway bridge or tunnel and was unable to pay for the work done because of the unconstitutionality of the legislative act purporting to authorize it the court should be valid and binding upon the county to the extent to which such work had been completed prior to the date on which the act was declared unconstitutional The statute was attacked as authorizing a loan or donation of the countrys money to a corporation or individual and as a legislative assumption of judicial powers Held it was constitutional Kennedy v Meyer Pa 1918 103 Atl 44 It is well settled that when a county or municipality has received benefits under a contract unenforceable against it because made in excess of its authority or in noncompliance with the provisions of a controlling statute the legislature if it could originally have authorized the transaction may by curative legislation validate the claim arising therefrom Mayor v Tenth Natl Bank 1888 111 N Y 446 18 N E 618 4 McQuillin Mun Corp  1894 Such legislation is not an invasion of the judicial prerogative for it concedes the unenforceability of the obligation declared invalid by the courts as contracted without legislative authorization and merely supplies the sanction necessary to validate it Steele County v Erskine C C A 1899 98 Fed 215 It does not contemplate a gratuitous dis position of the public funds and hence is not violative of a constitutional provision prohibiting the legislature from authorizing the gift or loan of money by a county to an individual or corporation The satisfaction of the moral obligation resting upon the county or municipality because of the benefit it has received under the contract cannot be called a gratuity for that would presuppose the absence of any claim legal or moral Steele County v Erskine supra contra Conlin v Board of Supervisors 1893 99 Cal 17 33 Pac 753 The curative act need not correct the errors of the prior act New Orleans v Clark 1877 95 U S 644 see Marion Water Co v City of Marion 1903 121 Iowa 306 96 N W 883 nor need the other party to the contract proceed further to perform under a new and valid authoriza tion WroughtIron Bridge Co v Town of Attica 1890 119 N Y 204 23 N E 542 The principal case is distinguishable from those cited in that the original claim was unenforceable not because it was ultra vires on the part of the county but because the statute purporting to authorize it was unconstitutional its title having failed to express the legislative purpose The principle involved is however identical if the legislature had power originally to authorize the transaction out of which the claim arose its ratification is sufficient to render enforceable an obligation that was imperfect only because incurred without such sanction Cf Donley v City of Pittsburgh 1892 147 Pa 348 23 Atl 394 608

Clark and John T Harris Jr for the appellees SIMONTON J delivered the opinion of the court This case comes up on appeal from the Circuit Court of the United States for the Western District of Virginia The Shenandoah Iron Company a manufacturing corporation of the State of Virginia became insolvent The trustee of a first mortgage on the property of the company filed a bill for the foreclosure thereof under which receivers were appointed and on a full hearing obtained its decree for sale Creditors were called in who submitted proofs of their claims to a special master appointed by the court The master made his report The mortgage bears date April 1 1881 and secures bonds bearing the same date to the amount of 500 000 In his report the master stated the claims in classes according to his views of their priority Among these were certain claims for labor and supplies which ex isted against the defendant company prior to the appointment of the receivers but subsequent in date to the mortgage The claimants insisted that these claims had priority over the mort gage debts and that the proceeds of sale should be applied to their ex tinction before any part of the mortgage debt could be paid They rest their position on the Acts of the General Assembly of the State of Virginia passed in 1877 and 1879 and on sec 2485 of the Code of Virginia The Circuit Court overruled this claim of priority holding that the statutes of Virginia were unconstitutional and void and that sec 2485 of the Code of Virginia as to these claims under the circumstances of this case was also void Exceptions were taken and assignments of error made The ques tion now to be decided is this As the law of Virginia stood at the date of the passage of the Code of 1887 had claims for labor or supplies against manufacturing com panies a lien prior to the lien of an antecedent recorded mortgage  On 21st March 1877 the General Assembly of Virginia passed an Act entitledCROWTHER V FIDELITY ETC CO  An Act to secure the payment of wages or salaries to certain employees of railway canal steamboat and other corporations The words of the Act are  Be it enacted by the General Assembly That hereafter all conductors brakes men enginedrivers firemen captains stewards pilots clerks depot or office agents store keepers mechanics or laborers and all persons furnishing railroad iron fuel and all other supplies necessary for the operation of trains and engines employed in the service of any railroad canal or other transportation company chartered under or by the laws of this State or doing business within its limits shall have a prior lien on the franchises the gross earnings and all the real and personal property of said company which is used in operating the same for and to the extent of the wages or salaries contracted to be paid them by said com pany It will be noted that the title of this Act speaks of railway canal steamboat and other corporations The Act itself the en actment which is the law confines its operation to railroad canal or other transportation companies  The constitution of Virginia article 5 section 15 provides that no law shall embrace more than one object and that shall be ex pressed in the title The object of this act clearly is to protect employees of railroad canal and other transportation companies And if we give the title the broad signification claimed for it by the appel lants and make the words  other corporations mean corporations of every class as well as corporations for transportation purposes the title of the act would not express its object and the act would be obnox ious to the constitutional requirement But the construction should be adopted  ut res magis valeat quam pereat and to save this act we must conclude as the court below did that the words  other corporations  in this title must be construed by the maxim noscitur a sociis and hold that it means corporations ejusdem generis And this manifestly is the legislative construction of the act by the General Assembly of Virginia On 2d April 1879 an act was passed entitled An act to amend and reenact the first and second sections of an act approved March 21 1877 entitled an act to secure the payment of the wages or salaries to certain employees of railway canal steamboat and other transportation compan ies The body of the act is as follows  Be it enacted by the General Assembly that hereafter all conductors brakes men enginedrivers firemen captains stewards pilots clerks depot or office agents storekeepers mechanics or laborers and all persons furnishing railroad 869 1898VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER iron engines cars fuel and all other supplies necessary for the operation of any railway canal or other transportation company or of any mining or mahufactur ing company chartered under or by the laws of this State or doing business within its limits shall have a prior lien on the franchises the gross earnings and on all the real and personal property of said company which is used in operating the same to the extent of the moneys due them by said company for such wages or supplies and no mortgage deed of trust sale conveyance or hypthecation hereafter executed of said property shall defeat or take precedence over said lien but it is expressly provided that the liens of the employees and officials aforesaid shall be prior to that of all other liens whatsoever and shall be the first dis charged  Section 2 provides the mode of securing the lien provided for in the first section It will be noted that whilst the title of this act declares that it is designed to amend and reenact the first and second sections of the former act the body of the act itself goes much farther than this and includes in addition to the transportation corporations mining and manufacturing corporations Is this a compliance with the constitu tional provision  It is not unless it be held that the words  to amend and reenact meet the requisite of the constitution But in Fidelity Insurance Com pany v Shenandoah Valley R Co 9 S E 759 86 Va 1 the Court of Appeals of Virginia construing these same acts does not hold the words quoted sufficient for this purpose The title of the first act stated that its purpose was to secure the payment of wages or sal aries to employees The body of the act included supplies necessary for the operation of the corporations mentioned The second act as we have seen in the title declares its purpose to amend and reenact this section The court however hold that as the word supplies  was not mentioned in the title of the first act the omission was not cured by the second act and that as to the lien for supplies both of the acts were unconstitutional and void The language of the decision of the court clearly shows that both acts must be controlled by the title of the first act The title is misleading and deceptive It gave not the remotest intimation of the provisions of the act relied on here which are foreign to the subject ex pressed in the title and to sustain the act in its entirety would be in effect by judical construction to eliminate from the constitution one of its most important provisions or at all events to seriously impair its usefulness The conclusion of the court after an able and elaborate discus sion is In the light of these principles there can be no reasonable doubt we think 870 AprilCROWTHER V FIDELITY ETC CO that so much of the act and the act amendatory thereof as is relied on in the pres ent case is repugnant to the constitution and therefore void This decision of the court of last resort of the State of Virginia construing its own statutes and constitution is of the highest author ity in this court Whether statutes of a State have been duly enacted in accordance with the requirement of the constitution of such State is not a Federal question and the decision of State courts as to what are the laws of a State is binding on the courts of the United States Leiper v Texas 139 U S 462 The decision of the Supreme Court of a State as to the comformity of a statute to the State constitution is binding on the Supreme Court of the United States on writ of error Pittsburg C C  St L R R Co v Backus 154 U S 421 The appellant also relies upon section 2485 of the Code of Virginia adopted in 1887 in these words Section 2485 Lien of Employees c of Transportation Companies c on Franchises and Property of CompanyAll conductors brakemen engine drivers firemen captains stewards pilots clerks depot or office agents storekeep ers mechanics or laborers and all persons furnishing railroad iron engines cars fuel and all other supplies necessary to the operation of any railway canal or other transportation company or of any mining or manufacturing company chartered under or by the laws of this State or doing business within its limits shall have a prior lien on the franchise gross earnings and on all the real and personal property of said company which is used in operating the same to the extent of the moneys due them by said company for such wages or supplies and no mortgage deed of trust sale hypothecation or conveyance executed since the twentyfirst day of March eighteen hundred and seventyseven shall defeat or take precedence over said lien provided that if any person entitled to a lien as well under section twentyfour hundred and seventyfive as under this section shall perfect his lien given by either section he shall not be entitled to the benefit of the other When these bonds were issued 1881 the mortgage securing them had by contract a vested first lien Can this lien be divested by any Act of the State of Virginia subsequent to the execution of the mortgage  In Toledo c R R Co v Hamilton 134 U S at page 299 the Supreme Court is emphatic in its declaration that the obligation of the mortgage contract cannot be impaired by any act of the mort gagor And in Barnitz v Beverly 163 U S 118 the same doctrine is applied to the operation of a State statute The cases of Ewell v Daggs 108 U S 143 and Gross v United States Mortgage Co 108 U S 488 relied on by the appellant nei ther overrule nor are in conflict with the law as laid down in 163 U 1898 871VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER S 118 supra These cases deal with a privilege belonging to the remedy forming no element in the rights that adhere in the contract In the first of these cases Ewall v Daggs the subsequent statute took away the right to avoid the contract given by the first statute  This right  says the court  is given by statute for purposes of its own and not because it affects the merits of the obligation and that whatever the statute gives under such circumstances as long as it remains in fieri and not realized by having passed into a completed transaction may by a subsequent statute be taken away Judge Cooley sums it up tersely The right which the curative or repeal ing act takes away in such a case is the right of the party to avoid his contract a naked legal right which it is usually unjust to insist upon and which no constitutional provision was ever designed to protect Cooley Const Lim 378 In the case of Gross v United States M1ortgage Co above cited the case last quoted was affirmed In the Gross case a loan made by a foreign corporation could not be secured by a mortgage in Illinois The United States Mortgage Company held such a mortgage After its execution the law of Illinois was changed and such mortgages were validated The court sustained this act But no vested liens were interfered with no contract obligation impaired No rights infringed A contract lien binding on the conscience of all parties was enforced Inasmuch as to displace the vested lien of the mortgage of the Shenandoah Iron Company of 1881 by the retroactive language of sec 2485 of the Code of Virginia would bP to impair the obligation of that contract it is void The decree of the Circuit Court is Affirmed 872 April

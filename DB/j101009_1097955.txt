OTHERSDecided at Richmond January 20 1898Harrison J Absent Cardwell J 1 CONTRACTS TO PAY MONEYlime not of essence of contractReliefLease Right of renewalConditions precedent Mere default in the payment of money at a stipulated time generally admits of compensation and hence the time of pay ment is rarely of the essence of the contract and when time is not of the essence of the contract and compensation can be made courts of equity can grant relief even against the failure to perform punctually conditions precedent But such relief will not be granted at the instance of a party who has been guilty of gross negligence In the case of a lease for ninetynine years renewable for ever upon payment of an annual ground rent on a given day each year and taxes and on the payment of one years rent extraordinary and the costs of preparing contract at the end of the first period with right of the landlord to reenter at any time during term for default in payment of rent for six months and hold the premises until the rent and taxes are paid the mere failure at the end of the first period to pay the one years rent extraordinary and costs through ignorance of the fact that the term had expired and under the circumstances of this case does not entitle the landlord to reenter and take possession of the premises and a court of equity will compel the lessors to perform their covenant to renew CHESAPEAKE  OHIO RAILWAY CO V CHAMBERSDecided at Richmond January 20 1898Keith P Absent Riely and Cardwell JJ 1 CONDEMNATION FOR DAM AND GUARDBANKFailure to repairResulting damages Although

TALIAFERRODecided at Richmond January 20 1898Buchanan J Absent Cardwell J 1 EVIDENCEObjections toIntroducing the same evidence If a party objects to the introduction of evidence which is admitted and afterwards introduces the same evidence himself it is no ground for reversing the judgment although the evi dence objected to was incompetent 2 INSTRUCTIONS BASED ON ONLY PART OF THE EVIDENCE It is not error to refuse an instruction based upon only a part of the evidence which tends to prove the fact at issue and omits altogether other evidence tending to prove the same fact 43VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 3 VERDICTConfliting evidenceBenefits and burdens of a contract This court will not set aside the verdict of a jury and award a new trial on the ground that the verdict was contrary to the law and evidence where the evidence is conflict ing and it appears that there was evidence sufficient to justify the verdict In the case at bar the defendant refused the request of the plaintiff to rescind the contract out of which the plaintiffs claim grew and insisted on retaining the benefit of it and it must therefore bear its burdens also SMELTZ BROS V RIX  BENTLEYDecided at Richmond January 20 1898Keith P Absent Cardwell J 1 APPEALS AND ERRORAmount in Controversy The amount in controversy on an appeal from a decree which perpetually enjoins a sale under a deed of trust given to secure notes amounting to 500 is the whole sum secured 2 NEGOTIABLE PAPERChange sAlterations The maker of a negotiable note who consents to a change of the date of the note cannot thereafter complain of such change as an alteration 3 DEED OF TRUSTSecurity for endorsers or suretiesSecurity for notes Where a deed of trust is given to secure sureties or endorsers and they have incurred no loss or damage the security does not enure to the benefit of the creditor but the evidence in the case at bar shows that the deed of trust was made by the makers of two notes to secure the payment of the notes themselves and not merely as security for the endorsers thereof TOWNSEND AND OTHERS V OUTTEN AND OTHERSDecided at Rich mond January 20 1898Buchanan J Absent Cardwell J 1 DEEDRelease of interestSubsequent assertion of title A grantee in a deed who has released all interest in the property conveyed in consideration of the conveyance to her of other property by the grantor which last mentioned convey ance was made on condition that she should execute such release cannot there after assert any title or interest under the first mentioned deed 2 DEEDSPartitionCovenantfor quiet enjoyment A deed which contains no clause of conveyance but recites that the parties thereto have made partition and division between them of the lands therein mentioned of which they were seised in fee and declares what part each is to have and covenants that neither of them nor any person claiming under either shall disturb the other in the possession and enjoyment of the part allotted to him is a mere deed of partition 3 DEEDSTitle subsequently acquiredEstoppelCase in judgment A grantor is estopped to claim a title subsequently acquired not only where he has conveyed with a warranty but also where the deed of conveyance recites or affirms ex pressly or impliedly that the grantor is seised of a particular estate which the deed purports to convey and upon the faith of which the bargain is made But this rule has no application to the case in judgment as the appellees are not claiming any portion of the land allotted to the grantor of appellants in the deed of partition between him and the grantor of the appellees 44 May

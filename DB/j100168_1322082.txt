provides that assignments preferring certain creditors shall be void Such an assignment was executed in N Y by a citizen of N Y conveying personal property in S C Held that as such assignment was contrary to the public policy of the State it was void in S C though by the law of N Y such preference is not only permitted but required and though none of the creditors attaching it reside in S C Sheldon v Blanvelt 7 S E Rep 593 S C CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  INTERSTATE COMMERCE  Transportation by con tinuous carriage from a point in one State over connecting lines which pass through another State

 Y V Ry Co 7 S E Rep 836 S C CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  TONNAGE DUTY  OYSTER DREDGING  A Mary land statute imposed a tax of three dollars per ton upon all vessels employed in dredging for oysters in the State waters Held that this was not a tonnage duty but a lawful compensation demanded by the State as the proprietor of the oyster beds for the privilege of taking oysters and that it was but reasonable that this compensation should be rated according to the size of the vessel used Dize v Lloyd et al 36 Fed Rep 651 Md CRIMINAL LAW  ASSAULT  IUSBAND AND WIFE  VENEREAL DISEASE A husband who being aware that he has a venereal disease has con nection with his wife who is ignorant of his condition and communicates the disease to her cannot be convicted under a statute of an assault occasion ing actual bodily harm Reg v Clarence Cr Cas Res 5g L T Rep N S 780 Eng Eight judges for one reason or another agreed in the decision four judges dissented Seven opinions were delivered The principal propositions advanced by various of the majority were as follows First that there can be no assault by means of infection second that the concealment by the husband of his condition was not such fraud as vitiated the wifes consent and third that if fraud in question could vitiate the consent to the contamination it would also vitiate the consent as to the intercourse these not being separable HZegarty v Shine 14 Cox C C 124 at 145 and the result would be that the husband would be guiltyRECENT CASES 387 of a rape upon his wife which is impossible on account of the fundamental idea of the marriage relation Hales P1 Cr 628 The minority on the contrary expressed the following various opinions First that there can be an assault by infection second that the husbands fraud vitiated the wifes consent in toto and third that even if his fraud did not vitiate her consent as to the act of intercourse still it did vitiate her consent as to the contaminiation by disease these being separable Reg v Benlett 4 F  F I105 Reg v Sinclair 13 COx C C 28 and that therefore although the husband could not be convicted of a rape upon his wife still he could be coni victed of an assault by way of infection Mr Justice Stephen who was of the majority in discussing the application of the maxim that fraud vitiates consent in the similar cases of Reg v Flattery 2 Q B D 410 and Reg v Dee 14 Ir L C L 468 said that the only sorts of fraud which so far destroy the effect of a womans consent as to convert a con nection consented to in fact into a rape are frauds as to the nature of the act itself or as to the identity of the person who does the act CRIMINAL LAW  HIOMICIDE  IRRESISTIBLE IMPULSE  Mere irresistible impulse though arising from mental derangement is not a defence to an indictment for murder provided the accused knew that the act which he was committing was a crime morally and punishable by the laws State v Alex ander 8 S E Rep 440 S C This case seems to indicate a disposition on the part of our courts to do away entirely with this defence EVIDENCE  JUDTCIAL NOTICE  RAILROAD LINES  The court has judicial knowledge of the fact that certain railroads touch the same points and are prac tically parallel and necessarily competing lines Gulf C  St F R R Co v State IO S W Rep 8i Tex EVIDENCE  PROMISSORY NOTE  CONDITION SUBSEQUENT BY PAROL AGREE MENT  Evidence is admissible that a promissory note delivered to the payee was executed in contemplation of a proposed transaction and with a collateral oral agreement that it should become of no effect if the makers attorney should disapprove of the transaction and such note is rendered void upon expression of the attorneys disapproval Ware v Allen 9 Sup Ct Rep 174 This is it is to be noticed the case of a

v Newberry digested in 2 IIARV L REV 289 FEDERAL COURTS  JURISDICTION  DOMICILE OF CORPORATIONS  U S Act March 3 1887 provides that an action shall be brought in no other district than that of which defendant is an inhabitant Held that a railway corporation is an inhabitant only of the State which created it and federal courts elsewhere will not take jurisdiction of an action against it Filli v Delaware L  W R Co 37 Fed Rep 65 N Y FEDERAL COURTS  PRECEDENTS  FOLLOWING STATE DECISIONS  When the construction of a State constitution or statute involves no federal question and has been settled by the decision of the highest tribunal of the State it is a general rule of decisions in the federal courts to follow and adopt such decision and this rule is to be followed even where the U S Supreme Court has given a different construction to the State law There are however exceptions to this rule first when rights of property have been acquired under former decisions secondly when on the same transactions the federal court has first passed and the decisions of the State court relied upon do not meet the independent judgment of the U S Supreme Court and thirdly when general questions of commercial law are involved Perhaps there is also an exception in cases involving con troversies between citizens of different States New Orleans Water Works v Brewing Co 36 Fed Rep 833 La The above rule it would seem is discretionary and will not be followed so strictly as to violate the demands of truth and justice See Geljcke v City of Dubuque I Wall 175 HUSBAND AND WIFE  IUSBAND MAY

particulars Held that a husband could recover on an express con388 HAR VARD LA W RE VIE W tract made by his wife to repay money loaned to her by him for a proper use in her separate business But the husband must show not only an express con tract but also that in equity and good conscience he is entitled to enforce his claim The contract is not valid in the sense that it can be enforced strictly as contract This is so because in strict law the    theory of the unity of person still exists Harrell v Harrell I9 N E Rep 621 Ind As to partnerships between husband and wife see Toof v Brewer 3 So

contract and an injunction was granted to prevent him from breaking its negative stipulations  There can be no doubt that an infant may enter into a contract which is beneficial to himself and is bound by it Leslie v Fitzpatrick 3 Q B D 229 an action against an infant for damages arising for breach of contract gives the correct test of the contract Whether the pro visions are inequitable or not depends on considerations outside the contract If such provisions were at the time common to labor contracts or were in the then condition of trade such as the master was reasonably justified in imposing as a just mneasure of protection to himself and if the wages were a fair compensation for the services of the youth the contract is binding inasmuch as it was bene ficial to himself by securing to him permanent employment and the means of maintaining himself Fellows v Wood 59 L T Rep N S 5I3 Q B D S C 39 Alb L J 76 Eng JUDICIAL SALE  FAILURE OF PURCHASER TO COMPLY WITH BID Where at a sale of property under order of the court for the benefit of creditors a purchaser after his bid has been accepted and the sale reported refuses to comply with the terms of his bid the court may without confirming the sale to him order a resale of the property and after such resale enter a decree against him for the deficiency between his bid and the proceeds of the resale with costs Camden v Mayhew 9 Sup Ct Rep 246 JURY METHOD OF ESTIMATING DAMAGES  It is proper for a jury in an action for unliquidated damages to add together the amounts named by the several jurors and divide the sum by twelve and then to adopc the result as their verdict but such method must not be made use of pursuant to an agreement to be bound by the result City of Kinsley v Morse 20 Pac Rep 222 Kan Yunt v Elliott 20 Pac Rep 132 Cal lThe propriety of recommending such a proceeding to the jury is briefly dis cussed in 7homas v Dickinson I2 N Y 364 372 LIEN  CONSTRUCTIVE TRUST  MINGLING OF FUNDS  Defendant having innocently received money paid him by the plaintiffs through mistake and mingled it with his own spent a part of the whole amount and bought land with the remainder IHeld that a constructive trust would arise upon the land had the transaction been between citizens of the United States but that the plaintiffs being aliens could not under the laws of Texas claim a resulting or constructive trust in the land but were entitled to a lien on the land for the amount furnished Zuidell et al v Gess 9 S W Rep 879 Tex It wolild seem notwithstanding the dictum of the court that under the cir cumstances of the case if the plaintiffs had been citizens they would have been entitled to no more for it does not appear that there was any wrongful dealing with the plaintiffs property from which the law could raise a trust in the strict sense of the word NEGLIGENCE  DECEIT  MISREPRESENTATION  CARELESS STATEMENTS  The solicitors of the plaintiff the intending mortgagee of property required the owner to obtain a valuation of the property The owner employed the defend ants a firm of valuers who knowing the purpose for which the valuation was to be used carelessly fixed a value which they had no reasonable ground to believe to be correct and informed the plaintiffs solicitors of their valuation The plaintiff acting on the advice of his solicitors and induced by the repre sentations of the defendants advanced money upon the security of a mortgage of the property The mortgagor having defaulted in payment and the property proving to have been greatly overvalued and insufficient to answer the mortgage it was held that the plaintiff could recover from the defendants for the damage sustained by him The decision was put on two grounds entirely independentRECENT CASES 389 of a contract relation first that under the authority of Heaven v Pender Ir Q B D 503 and George v Skivington L R 5 Ex i the defendants having knowingly put themselves in the position of furnishing the plaintiff a document called a valuation upon the basis of which he was to act incurred in point of law a duty towards him to use reasonable care in its preparation and were liable to him for negligence in the performance of this duty and secondly that on the authority of Peek v Derry 37 Ch D 54I digested 2 HARV L REv 189 when a man makes an untrue statement to another with an

39 Ch D 39 s c 59 L T Rep N S 723 Eng For discussion of this case see note supra in present number of the REVIEW NovATION  The assent of the creditor is a necessary element in the substitu tion of a new for an old debtor To constitute such a novation there must be a mutual agreement between all three parties whereby at the same time the old debt is extinguished and the new debt is created Cornwell v Megins 40 N W Rep 6io Minn PARTNERSHIP  INFANT PARTNER  Firm property may be held for the debts of a firm although one of the partners is an infant but the infant may repudiate all personal liability on the firm debts Pelletier v Conture I9 N E Rep 400 Mass This decision seems to recognize that so far as responsibility for debts is con cerned the firm is an entity distinct from the individual partners who may or may not have the capacity to incur personal liability PATENTS FOR INVENTIONS  DURATION  PRIOR FOREIGN PATENTS  U S Rev St  4887 provides that every patent for an invention previously patented in a foreign country shall expire at the same time with the foreign patent and shall not remain in force more than seventeen years Act Canada I872 permits the holder of a fiveyear patent to obtain as a matter of right on pay ment of a fee two subsequent extensions of five years each A Canadian patent for five years having been granted on an invention a United States patent was granted on the same invention for seventeen years The Canadian patent was suhsequently renewed for the two additional terms of five years ileId the fifteenyears term of the Canadian patent having been continuous that the United States letterspatent continued valid during its entire duration and expired at the end of the fifteen years Blatchford J Although the United States patent may on its face run for seventeen years from its date it is to be so limited by the courts as a matter to be adjudicated on evidence in pais as to expire at the same time with the foreign patent not running in any case more than seventeen years but subject to the latter limitation it is to be in force as long as the foreign patent is in force Bate Refrigerating Co v Hammond Co 9 Sup Ct Rep 225 This

of Ohio in I879 made an assignment in his individual capacity of all his property for the payment of his debts expressly excepting all property held by him in trust for others Certain property was vested in him to hold according to the laws and canons of the Roman Catholic Church for the use of priests and their congregations schools and their teachers for sisters of charity and orphans in their charge together with certain land for use as burial places None of the beneficiaries were incorporated societies and they were constantly changing moreover the Archbishop without opposition from any one concerned had frequently exercised acts of dominion over property so coming to him both selling and substituting other property HelZd that thereREVIEWS 39I was a valid trust for proper purposes The unincorporated bodies mentioned although their membership was constantly changing were sufficiently identified as cestuis and they were properly represented by prominent members suing in behalf of themselves and others The nature of the Archbishops interest was permitted to be shown by the laws and canons of the church although some of them ran back for fifteen centuries Mannix v

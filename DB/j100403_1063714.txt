LEACH Asst Bus Mgr THE ADMISSIBILITY IN EVIDENCE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICA TIONS BETWEEN HUSBAND AND WIFE IN THE POSSESSION OF THIRD PERSONSThe privilege accorded communications between husband and wife originated in the public policy which seeks to preserve in violate the peace good order and limitless confidence which should characterize marital relations in wellordered society1 This priv ilege in time of origin was among the first of such privileges to be recognized at common law The first instaince of its application is found to be about the year 16852 yet the explicit statement of the privilege as such did not appear until the English Common Law Procedure Act about the year 18523 The explanation for this seeming paradox is that until that time the present privilege of com munlications between husband and wife had been confused with the rule of the common law disqualifying the husband or wife from testifying for or against each other In other words the true policy of the present privilege was perceived but not enforced as a rule within itself separate and distinct This was largely due to the fact that few cases of privileged communications arose at Mercer v State

v Crafts 18 Q B 367 374 believed that As no protection was given to conjugal confidence in respect to the wives of the witnesses not parties the rule must be re garded as Not yet establishedNOTES that time which did not fall within the category of marital dis qualifications Upon the abolition by modern statutes of these dis qualifications it became necessary to establish as an independent rule the privilege of communications between husband and wife The reason for excluding as evidence communications between husband and wife seems to be based upon sound public policy The communication arises out of confidence and confidence is essential to the marital relation the relation is a proper object for the en couragement of the law and the mischief and injury that would ensue from compelling disclosures of confidential communications between husband and wife would be greater than the benefits to be derived from their aid in judicial investigations4 And though it may tend to suppress the truth in isolated cases at the same time it affords to society as a whole a benefit which the law should not disturb Failure to protect it would tend to destroy the bond of mutual confidence and unquestioned trust which is essential to do mestic peace The law therefore should protect with zealous care any violation of confidence arising out of the marriage status6 Where on the other hand no confidence or secrecy was intended the reason for the protection is lacking and the privilege does not apply6 For this reason oral communications between husband and wife knowingly made in the presence of third parties are not priv ileged because no secrecy between husband and wife could be in tended7 and the public policy underlying this privilege seeks only to preserve inviolate the secret communications between husband and wife The question then naturally arises should the privilege protect oral communications between the husband and wife intended in con fidence and secrecy which unknown to the parties are overheard by eavesdroppers The answer to this question should be ascer tained from the reasons for the privilege and the objects sought in allowing it As seen above the true reason for the existence of the privilege is not because the communication fails to fall into the con trol of the third party but because public policy forbids that mar ital confidences be subjected to publicity If public policy makes the communication privileged where not heard by a third party can the intervention of eavesdroppers lessen or eliminate the lemands of public policy to preserve inviolate the marital secret It would seem that the demands of public policy which make the communica tion privileged in those cases where not heard by eavesdroppers would operate with equal force in those cases where the commlunica tion unknown to the husband and wife is overheard by eaves droppers While this view seems clearly sound on principle the courts have failed to recognize it and the great majority of decided cases hold contra8 See 4 WIGMORE Ev  2285 Mercer v State supra Lingo v State 29 Ga 470 See Hester v Hester 4 Dev 228 230 Reynolds v State 147 Ind 3 46 N E 31 Commonwealth v Griffin 110 Mass 181 Commonwealth v Everson 123 Ky 330 96 S W 460 124 Am St Rep 365 307VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Where the subjectmatter of the communication is in writing and in the possession of either spouse the authorities agree that the privilege prevents its admission as evidence except by consent9 A conflict arises where such written communications have fallen into the hands of third parties Probably the weight of authority holds that the privilege is lost under such circumstances1 and this even though the written communication was obtained by a third party through fraud or force11 It would seem however that such a holding contravenes the spirit of the policy which gave rise to the privilege and that such written communications should be in admissible save by consent notwithstanding the fact that they may have fallen into the hands of third persons12 Consonant with this principle it was held in the recent case of McCormick v State Tenn 186 S W 95 that written communications between the defendant and his wife which had fallen into the hands of third persons were inadmissible as evidence against the husband It is believed that the privilege should attach to the communica tion itself The policy of law that forms the foundation of the rule is best subserved by those authorities which declare that the privilege results from the inherent character of the communication itself13 As said above the communication is privileged where privileged at all not because it fails to fall into the hands of a third party but because it arises out of absolute confidence between husband and wife and because public policy demands that marital confidences shall not be subject to publicity Therefore the very raison drtre of the privilege indicates that the immunity attaches to the comnunication itself and any recognition of the privilege whatsoever if based on the true ground would seem to admit this fact Ilence to recognize the privilege in those instances where the subjectmatter of the communication remains in the custody of the spouse alddressed but to refuse to recognize it in those cases where the commlunication comes into the possession of a third party would seem to utterly lose sight of the demands of public policy and to make a distinction which is incapable of justification on principle If the demnanlds of public policy are sufficiently strong to cause the communication when first written or uttered to be privileged then the comntunication should be none the less privileged after it falls into the hands of thirld parties since the same reasons continue to exist and the demands of public policy affect the communication with a perpetual contemporaneousness14 There seems to be a tendency among some authorities which rec

parties to hold that the privilege is lost where the communicating spouse voluntarily entrusts a written communication into the hands of a third person for delivery to the other spouse15 It would seem upon principle that this act should constitute nothing more than evidence to rebut the presumption of the documents containing a privileged communication As has been indicated where no confi dence was intended on the part of the addressing spouse the priv ilege has no application to the case16 It seems proper to hold all marital communications prima facie confidential and that a con trary intention should be made to appear from the circumstances in order to rebut the presumption17 Looking at the habits of mar ried persons and the infrequency of expressed injunctions of se crecy the implication of secrecy and confidence seems more con sonant with the habits of married life If therefore the circum stances show that secrecy was intended in spite of the voluntary delivery to the third party the communication should be privileged and protected On the other hand if the circumstances of the de livery to the third party show that no secrecy was intended then the privilege has no application18 Supposing that the husband should write a letter to his wife intending secrecy and confidence but before the letter is posted the husband is arrested and the let ter taken from his person Should the letter to the wife which contains evidence of the crime alleged to have been committed by the husband be privileged The answer to this question lies in the principle contended for that the privilege should protect the subjectmatter of the communication even though in the hands of third larties9 In England a doctrine seems to prevail among some courts that while the original document or written instrument is privileged sec ondary evidence of its contents may be admitted20 It is difficult to understand the basis of such a distinction This is in effect en forcing the privilege only as to the physical instrument on which the communication is written and not as to the subjectmatter of the communication which is entirely aside from the purpose for which the privilege is designed It is held by some authorities that since the privilege is intended to secure freedom from apprehension of disclosure in the minds of the one desiring to communicate2 it follows that the privilege be longs to the communicating spouse only and the other spousethe addressee of the communicationis not entitled to claim the priv ilege22 This is not the case however where the spouse addressed People v Hayes

said that since the privilege is a personal one it may be waived24 A few courts however seem to have lost sight of this doctrine and hold otherwise This holding is probably due to the confusion of disqualification with privilege of communica tion25 The latter of course may be waived since the term priv ilege itself implies the right of the recipient to decide whether to take advantage of it or not The privilege is not terminated by a severance of the marital re lation The objects sought to be obtained in granting the privilege can only be obtained by continuing the protection in spite of a ter mination of the marital relation And in this respect the privilege differs from the common law marital disqualification The same considerations do not apply however to the acts or conduct of the married parties To extend the privilege to embrace such cases would be going beyond the purpose for which the immunity was designed26 Again the privilege has no application to communica tions made between husband and wife then living in separation or to communications between persons living in unlawful cohabita tion because to such cases the policy of the privilege does not ap ply since such relations are not those in which the law seeks to foster confidence27 SETOFF OF BANKS CLAIM AGAINST DEPOSITORS ACCOUNT AS CONSTITUTING A PREFERENCE UNDER  60 OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACTThe question of the exercise of the right of setoff by a bank against a bankrupts deposit is of unusual importance in its prac tical application to conditions arising in the present commercial world The Bankruptcy Act in preserving the right of setoff has not made provision for all of the many cases that may arise in the exercise of the right and much controversy has arisen in the application of the Act to some of the cases not specially provided for However the question as presented above seems to have been worked out by the courts with more or less definite precision by interpreting each section in the light of the purpose it is to ac complish and by giving an harmonious construction to the whole act  68a of the Bankruptcy Act specifically provides for the right of setoff In all cases of mutual debts or mutual credits between the estate of a bankrupt and a creditor the account shall be stated and one debt shall be set off against the other and the balance only shall be allowed or paid The application of this subdivi sion is settled  68b limits the scope of  68a A setoff or counterclaim shall not be allowed in favor of any debtor of the See 4 WIGMORe Ev  2340  Driver v Driver Ind 52 N E 401

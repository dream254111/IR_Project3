j100133,The Condor,1362514,The Speed of Flight in Certain Birds,i259183,THE SPEED OF FLIGHT IN CERTAIN BIRDS By ALEXANDER WETMORE DURING early November 1914 while carrying on field work around Tulare and Buena Vista lakes California in company with Mr Tipton Matthews Deputy Game Warden of Kern County I had excellent oppor tunity for observing the speed of flight of certain birds We had our head quarters at Lemoore while in the northern part of the area and daily made trips back and forth to the shore line of Tulare Lake in Mr Matthews auto Work around Buena Vista Lake was carried on with Bakersfield as a base In the open valley birds of various species were abundant and in traveling about I had leisure to watch them Often Horned Larks or other birds flew up close at hand and maintained a course parallel to that of the car On such occa sions Mr Matthews increased our speed gradually until we were travelling at a rate equal to that of the bird At the same time I kept close watch of the bird and the speedometer In this way we were able to gauge the speed of flight of these individuals with a fair amount of accuracy Following is a summary of the observations made Unless otherwise stated the notes refer to a single individual Species Locality Date Rate of flight in miles per hour Ardea herodias Tulare Lake Calif November 7 1914 28 t it it      28 Buteo b calurus Bakersfield   10  22 Cerchneis s phalaena      22         25 Colaptes c collaris Tulare Lake   8  25 Otocoris a actia     6  23 t it i     7  28    several       26    2     8  22    3      24    several Bakersfield   10  27 Corvus c sinuatus Foot of Tejon Pass     24 Lanius 1 gambeli Tulare Lake   6  28May 1916 THE SPEED OF FLIGHT IN CERTAIN BIRDS 113 Horned Larks were more abundant than other species along the roads which accounts for the number of tests made with them It is assumed that they were all Otocoris a actia as specimens collected belong to that form Their speed of flight as shown in the table varied from 22 to 28 miles per hour In some instances observations were made on two or three birds at the same time or on two occasions on small flocks In one test a Horned Lark travelling parallel to the car was easily outdistanced with a speed of 30 miles per hour Two Great Blue Herons observed separately travelled at exactly the same speed The rate of flight of a Western Redtail was found to be 22 miles per hour One Sparrow Hawk that flew parallel with us for nearly a quarter of a mile also maintained an even rate of 22 miles In these observations the birds that were timed were all near at hand The two Great Blue Herons were about seventy yards away the individuals of the other species much nearer As the distance of the bird from the car in creased there was an increase in liability to error but in the case of these two herons which were gauged separately the speed registered the same and all of the readings may be considered fairly accurate With the Horned Larks the observations were made often at a distance of only 30 or 40 feet With all of these birds only those pursuing a direct flight were recorded When the course was erratic from side to side the birds were disregarded In examining the results a surprising agreement is found in the rate of flight of birds entirely unrelated and in species varying greatly in size There is no doubt that if frightened any of those observed might have made a more rapid course but I believe that the figures show approximately normal flight in all That these speeds fall far below those attributed to birds in general will I think be appreciated at a glance Washington D C March 31 1916

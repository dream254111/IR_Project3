follows Finally there are certain normal changes that occur in animals and plants that are not the result of injury to the organism and these have many points in common with the processes of re generation They are generally spoken of as processes of physiological regeneration The an nual moulting of the feathers of birds the periodic loss and growth of the horns of stags the break ing down of cells in the different parts of the body after they have been active for a time and their replacement by new cells the loss of the peristome in the protozoon Stentor and its re newal by a new peristomne are examples of physio logical regeneration This group of phenomena must also be included under the term regenera tion since it is not so sharply separated from that including those cases of regeneration after injury or loss of a part and both processes appear to involve the same factors Again on p 25 ibid Morgan says that he will use the term physiological regeneration to include such changes  as the moulting and replacement of the feathers of birds the re placement of teeth etcchanges that are a part of the lifecycle of the individual In some cases it can be shown that these processes are clearly related to ordinary regeneration as when a feather pulled out is formed aiiew withoutiPvAItingIT the next moultTng period and formed presumably out of the same rudi mdnt that would have made the new feather in the ordinary moulting process  Finally on pp 128131 ibid Morgan refers to the general f act that in the same animal certain organs may be continually worn away and as slowly replaced and other organs replaced only at regular intervals and he lists a number of familiar instances of regularly recurring physiological regenera tion as the moulting of snakes the throwing off of deer antlers and their renewing and also the moulting of insects As this is the only instance of physiological regeneration in insects mentioned by the author and as it seems to be desirable to know especially as a basis for any discussion of the relation be tween physiological regeneration and the more familiar restorative phenomenon called simply regeneration of any other instances of physiological regeneration occurring among the lower animalsalmost all the cited cases of physiological regeneration are among the vertebratesI wish to point out briefly cer tain important and widespread phenomena in insect biology which should be included in the category of physiological regeneration proc esses Indeed Morgan specifically refers to the need of such further knowledge How far he says physiological regeneration takes place in the tissues of the lower animals we do not know at present except in a few cases but far from supposing it to be absent it may be as well developed as in higher forms First may be mentioned theradical regen eration of the digestive epithelium of the ventriculus common to all  insects a phenomenon long known albeit in a rather hazy way perhaps to students of insect mor phology but in the last ten years carefully studied and satisfactorily worked out for a number of insect forms representing several widely separated orders See the papers of Mobusz Rengel Van Gehuchten Needham and others This process consists of the con stant senescence and complete degeneration of the nuclei and cytoplasm of thelarge epithelial cells of the

increase in size growth and migration toward the lumen with an accompanying new formation of surrounding cytoplasm The vigor of nucleus and cytoplasm seems to be exhausted after the secretion and discharge of a certain amount of digestive fluid and rapid and perfectly obvious senescence and histolysis take place Inspection of crosssections of the ventriculus of any feeding caterpillar will show this normal physiological regeneration phenomenon in most illuminating manner While this regenerative process was when first noted considered to be a part of that extensive general histolysis and histogenesis which regu larly accompanies the postembryonic develop ment of insects with complete metamor phosis it is now knownthanks especially to Needhams discriminating workto be a phe nomenon also accompanying or incident to digestion occurring all through the feeding life of the insect and not limited to that period in late larval life prepupal life when the radical histolysis of the larval organs occurs preparatory to or coincident with the newbuilding histogenesis of the imaginal adult organs There is however probably always a marked and unusual degree of re generation of alimentary epithelium during the prepupal and early pupal stages i e at the time of the radical transformation phe nomena This has been recently well shown in the case of the waterbeetle Cybister by Degeener A more striking phenomenon or group of phenomena of physiological regeneration in insects is that extraordinary double process of degeneration and moulting on the one hand and regeneration and complete newbuilding on the other which characterizes the ontogeny in postembryonic life of the insects with socalled  complete metamorphosis i e those insects which come from the egg in a form larva radically different from that of the definitive adult condition From the butter flys egg there hatches a caterpillar without wings without compound eyes with eight pairs of legs with minute short two or three segmented antennae with biting and chewing mouthparts composed of heavy mandibles jawlike maxillae and flaplike labium with musculature for wormlike and creeping loco motion and with simple straight alimentary canal for the manipulation and digestion of bits of solid food leaves etc But the but terfly into which the caterpillar develops has wings compound eyes long manysegmented antennae only three pairs of legs sucking mouthparts composed of a curious long flex ible tube made up of the maxillae alone with mandibles wholly wanting and labium reduced to a small fixed sclerite complex musculature for flight and a long twisted alimentary canal with conspicuous saclike diverticula for hold ing and digesting flower nectar In even greater degree do the larva and adult of the Diptera and Hymenoptera differ and in only slightly less degree those of the Neuroptera and Coleoptera Now in all these specialized insects the development from larva to adult usually achieved in a few days or weeks is not accomplished by a slow gradual transfor mation of the parts of the larva into those of the adult but is distinguished by the curious fact that many if not most of the larval organs are either wholly cast aside by moult ing at the time of pupation or undergo a radical histolysis resulting in complete dis integration The larval mouth parts and an tennae are completely discarded at pupation last larval moulting and have their places taken by wholly new and usually markedly different mouth parts and antennae the larval musculation parts or the whole of the ali mentary canal the salivary glands and iMal pighian tubules and parts or the whole of the tracheal system degenerate and have their places taken by radically new muscles ali mentary canal salivary glands Malpighian tubules and trachea produced regenerated from elementary cell groups called histoblasts or imaginal buds This phenomenon of whole sale histolysis and histogenesis characteristic of all the members of all the orders of insects with complete metamorphosis with some Coleoptera and some Neuroptera the break down and newbuilding is slight is to be looked on as a wholesale and extreme case of I Zool Jahrb v 20 pp 499676 1904JANUARY 26 1906 SCIENCE 151 physiological regeneration It is a normal part of the ontogeny of these specialized in sects but it is an interpolated a coenogenetic condition That is although now a regularly recurring phenomenon in the life of these in sects it is distinguished only by the inevitable ness and regularity of its occurrence from any occasional processes involving profound regen eration It seems to me quite analogous with such cases of regularly recurring physiological regeneration as the moulting and newgrowth of the plumage of birds the casting off and newbuilding of the antlers of stags the loss of the peristome and the formation of a new one in Stentor etc in other words with all those cases mentioned by Morgan in illustra tion of his definition of physiological regen eration In the two special cases of physiological re generation in insects here called attention to we may distinguish between regeneration of the ventricular epithelium from tissue cells of its same kind and the regeneration of wings legs mouth parts and antenna from cells not belonging to similar organs but simply forming part of the continuous larval derm In this latter case of regeneration too the regenerated parts are in all cases differ ent from preexisting parts and in some cases wings for example are wholly new parts One might say that this is not regeneration at all but simply development ontogeny But in numerous cases of true restorative regeneration the new parts do not agree exactly with the replaced ones often they are mark edly smaller they lack segments they lack many details they are cases of teratogenesis For example the cockroaches Blattidse have the capacity of regenerating lost legs or rather parts of legs but whereas the normal leg has always five tarsal segments the regenerated one has always four All regeneration may of course be looked on as a phenomenon of ontogeny a regulation In practically all animals which can regenerate at all the ca pacity for regeneration is much greater in immature life than in adult life in many indeed it exists only in the immature stages in connection with this brief rweferende to the occurrence of physiological regeneration in insects it may not be amiss to refer even more briefly to our present knowledge of ordinary or what is called for the sake of a provisional distinction between the two cate gories restorative or accidental regeneration among insects It has long been known that certain insects of incomplete metamorphosis notably many Orthoptera have the power of regenerating lost parts of legs antennae and certain other externally produced organs as tracheal gills Associated with this regen erative capacity occurs in some insects at least selfmutilation or autotomy In addi tion it has also long been known that if the legs or antenna be cut off from the larva of certain insects with complete metamorphosis moths beetles and others the adult will ap pear with  regenerated  legs or antennae some times perfectly normal in size and form some times normal in form but reduced in size and other times abnormal usually lacking distal parts in form But as I have already pointed out in a paper on the regeneration of the larval legs of silkworms2 this latter kind of regeneration may not be restora tive regeneration at all but a phenomenon of physiological regeneration incident to the regular process of development of the im aginal legs antennae etc of insects of complete metamorphosis in the course of which the larval organs disintegrate and the imaginal ones get formed from histoblasts which lie in such position at least in early larval life as to be uninjured by any cutting of the larval legs Finally as I have shown in the paper just referred to the larvae of at least one species of moth Bombyx Morit have the capacity of regenerating during larval life both thoracic jointed legs and abdominal prop legs Tornier3 also states that the larvae of the meal worm Tenebrio molitor can also regenerate before pupation cut off legs or parts of legs4 2Jour of Exper Zook Vol I pp 593599 1904

Certain Char152 SCIENCE N S Vot XXIII No 578 Because of the importance that regenerative phenomena have in the consideration of cer tain fundamental biologic problems one might be tempted to try to find some significance in whatever special examples of regeneration happen to come under ones own observation The relation between physiological regenera tion and restorative regeneration is a subject very near at hand if one were to look for something to speculate about in connection with what I have noted in this paper on re generation in insects But with Morgan it seems to me that  we do not gain any insight into either of the processes so far as I can see by deriving one from the other for the process of restorative regeneration may be in point of time as old as that of physiological regeneration Indeed among the insects we have good grounds for believing restorative regeneration older than the particular proc esses of physiological regeneration which regularly accompany the postembryonic devel opment of insects with complete metamor phosis For these insects are admittedly the recent the postTertiary ones while the Or thoptera among which especially restorative regeneration is widespread and unusually well developed are among the oldest of living in sect orders They make up the bulk of insects known from preTertiary times The most extensive and radical of physiological regen eration processes occur precisely among the most specialized the most recent insects Finally as concerns the large question of whether regeneration is to be looked on as a certain primary primitive attribute of organ isms whose manifestation becomes weaker as complexity in structure and function is at tained in course of descent or whether as is held by the NeoDarwihians it is to be looked on as an adaptation which has been transmitted through a long and manybranched course of descent gradually weakening during this transmission until in the more complex organisms it is largely lost although in con sonance with need often retained even among higher forms this is a question I shall refer to only in so far as to say that the evidence presented by all that we know of regeneration in insects taken together certainly does not warrant any such definite conclusion as Tornier expresses on the basis of his experi ments with certain dragonfly and Mayfly larvae viz that regeneration in insects is an adaptation produced by natural selection VERNON L KELLOGG STANFORD UNIVERSITY CAL acters of Reproduced Appendages in Arthropoda Particularly in the Blattide Proc Zool Soc

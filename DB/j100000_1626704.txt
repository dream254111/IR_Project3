ornithologist died at Johns Hopkins Hospital Baltimore Md December 25 1899 at the compara tively early age of 57 years Dr Coues was born in Portsmouth N H September 9 1842 In 1853 his father Samuel El liott Coues removed with his family to Washington I C where Dr Coues was educated He was fitted for college at the Jesuit Seminary now known as Gonzaga College and in 1857 entered what is now the Columbian University taking his de gree of A B in 1861 and his medical de gree in 1863 and receiving later from the same institution the honorary degrees of M A and PhD While yet a medical stu dent he was enlisted as a medical cadet and soon after graduation was appointed assist ant surgeon in the United States Army his first station being Fort Whipple Ari zona Later he was assigned to Fort Macon North Carolina and afterwards to Fort McHenry Baltimore In 1873 he was or dered to Fort Randall Dakota and thence assigned as surgeon and naturalist to the United States Northern Boundary Commis sion which surveyed the line of the forty ninth parallel from the Lake of the Woods westward to the Rocky Mountains The following six years were spent in Washing ton the first two in the preparation of the scientific report of the Northern Boundary Survey on the conclusion of which he wasN S VOL XI No 266 detailed as secretary and naturalist of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of the Territories under the late Dr F V Hayden In 1880 he was again ordered to Arizona but the duties of a post surgeon on the frontier were so incompatible with the prosecution of the scientific work he had then in hand that failing to receive a more favorable assignment he resigned his army commission in order to devote his whole attention to scientific pursuits From 1881 till his death he resided in Washington making however in recent years several long journeys to the West and Southwest to aid his editorial re searches in connection with the early ex ploration of our transMississippi territory For ten years beginning with 1877 he filled the chair of Anatomy at the National Med ical College in Washington Dr Coues doubtless inherited from his father who wrote several notable specula tive works on physical science his strong love for scientific research His residence in Washington during his early years brought him into close contact with the late Professor Baird of whom he was a pupil and ardent admirer and who directed Couess early ornithological efforts His very first papers published while he was still a youth of eighteen took the form of technical monographs and would have been creditable to a far more experienced hand His  Monograph of the Tringece of North America and his Monograph of the Genus iEgiothus with Descriptions of New Species both appeared in 1861 and in thoroughness of research and in method of presentation foreshadow the authors sub sequent eminence in the ornithological field These were quickly followed by his  Synopsis of the North American Forms of Colymbidwe and Podicipidce  1862  Re vision of the Gulls and Terns of North America 1862  Critical Review of the Procellariidce 18641866 and his  Mon ograph of the Alcidt  1868 In the sum mer of 1860 he made a trip to Labrador which served as the basis of his notes on the Ornithology of Labrador 1861 and later his residence at various army posts both in the East and in the West gave him a wide field experience which he did not fail to utilize to the utmost During the twenty years from 1861 to 1881 he published 300 works and papers mostly ornithological and probably as many more between this latter date and the time of his death Although his orni thological writings relate mainly to North American birds they also include the science in its broadest sense He also published a number of special monographs on various families of North American mammals His contributions to the  Cen tury Dictionary representing about seven years of his best work include some 40000 entries which he either edited or contrib uted he having editorial charge of the sub jects General Zoology Biology and Com parative Anatomy Another important literary undertaking that absorbed the en ergies of his later years also outside of ornithology was the editing of the original Lewis and Clark Journals Pikes Ac count of his journey to the Rocky Moun tains Fowlers  Journal and Larpenteurs  Personal Narrative These works are of the highest interest relating as they do to the early exploration of western North America and have been edited and anno tated by Coues from the original documents with a thoroughness and minuteness of de tail that adds greatly to their value and interest Among Dr Couess more important spe cial works may be mentioned the following  Key to North American Birds 1872 en tirely rewritten and republished in 1884  Field Ornithology 1874  Birds of the Northwest 1874 Furbearing Animals 1877  Monographs of North American 162 SCIENCEFFBRTARY 2 1900 Rodentia with J A Allen 1877  Birds of the Colorado Valley 1878 Bibliography of Ornithology various installments 1878 1880 New England Bird Life with W A Stearns 1882 Dictionary and Check List of North American Birds 1882 For four years he edited the publications of the Hayden Survey Unfortunately only a small portion of his invaluable Bibliography of Ornithology was ever published but the published part has been of the greatest service to all workers on American birds to which these portions mainly relate No work doubtless has had such a benefi cent influence upon the progress of Amer ican ornithology as Couess Key origi nally published in 1872 and republished in 1884 as a practically new work During the last two years it has again been re written and again transformed and brought down to date we understand the manu scripts were left in such condition that the work will soon go to press and will doubt less prove a lasting monument to the in dustry and skill of its gifted author Dr Coues was not lacking in scientific honors In 1877 he was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences he was also a member of all the more prom inent American scientific societies and of many foreign academies and societies He was one of the founders of the Amer ican Ornithologists Union at one time its president and always a member of its council and more important committees He took a most earnest interest in its wel fare and fame and always viewed with sat isfaction and pride his share in its organ ization and achievements and his death will be held as a personal loss to his fellow members As I have said elsewhere Auk January 1900 p 91 Dr Coues as an allaround Ornithologist occupied a position of first rank among the cultivators of this science His influence upon the progress of technical ornithology in America is only second to that of Baird as a popular writer on birds he was without a peer His rare literary gifts rendered him a fluent and impressive speaker and a writer of exceptional read ability and originality of expression His activity was prodigious and his capacity for work phenomenal Though impulsive and at times somewhat erratic he had many admirable traits which none can so well appreciate as those who knew him most intimately J A ALLEN THE NEW DEPARTMEN7 OF VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY OF THE CARNEGIE MUSEUMI THE organization of this department in the Carnegie Museum during the past year has marked an important advance in the history of this young and growing institu tion The unequaled facilities which the western portions of our country afford for the pursuit of this important branch of sci ence have now come to be fully appreciated and have within the past few years resulted in giving to this study an impetus which a few years ago was totally unknown The remarkable consecutiveness of this life record together with its richness in vertebrate remains especially in the Meso zoic and the Tertiary rocks has permitted the gathering of collections of inestimable value when we consider what they con tribute to the solution of some of the great problems in biology It has always seemed to me that our leading institutions have been unusually slow to recognize the value and importance of these collections more especially when it is remembered that the greatest develop ment of the science has taken place in this country and has formed such a conspicuous feature of American achievement in scien tific investigation The addition of a new member to the comparatively limited circle SCIENCRE 163

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104176,A SHORT ACCOUNT OF A BOOK,I206907,264 IX A SHORT ACCOUNT BY JAMES PARSONS M D F R S OF A BOOK INTITULED TRAITE DES SENS C BY M LE CAT M D F R S PRINTED AT ROUEN 1740 8VO T H I S TREATISE APPEARS BY THE AD VERTISEMENT PRESIXED TO IT TO BE A PART OF A PHYSIOLOGICAL WORK WHICH THE AUTHOR SAYS IS NOT LIKELY TO BE SOON PUBLISHED AND THAT HE HAS THEREFORE EXHIBITED THIS PART FOR THE USE OF THE CU RIOUS AND LOVERS OF PHILOSOPHY WHO MIGHT NOT BE SO AGREEABLY ENTERTAINED BY THE REST OF THE WORK AS TREATING CHIEFLY OF THE HUMAN BODY AND THEREFORE CALCULATED RATHER FOR THOSE OF THE FACULTY OF ME DICINE READ DEC 16 1742 HE BEGINS THE BOOK WITH PAGE 201 AND SAYS HE HAS BEFORE ESTABLISHED CERTAIN GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF SENSATION AND THAT NOW HE PROCEEDS TO RECOUNT THE PARTICULAR PARTS WITH WHICH NATURE HAS FURNISHED THE ANIMAL OCCONOMY SERVING TO OUR DIFFERENT SENSES AND THEN EXPATIATES A LITTLE UPON THE GENERAL UTILITY OF THEM HIS FIRST CHAPTER TREATS OF THE SENSE OF FEELING WHEREIN HE HAS COMPILED ALL THE DIFFERENT PHAENO MENA THAT REGARD THIS SENSE AS THOSE OF HEAT COLD AND OTHER OBJECTS OF FEELING WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE SKIN TO WHICH HE THINKS FIT TO SUBJOIN TWO KNOWN HISTORIES ONE OF A BLIND ORGANIST IN HOL LAND WHO DISTINGUISHED ALL KINDS OF COINS AND PLAYED AT CARDS BY FEELING AND THE OTHER OF THE FAMOUS STATUARY GANIBASIUS WHO THOUGH STOUEBLIND COULD BY265 BY FEELING MAKE A STATUE IN CLAY PERFECTLY LIKE WHAT HE FELT OUR AUTHOR ADDS SOMETHING OF TICKLING AND ENDEAVOURS TO PROVE THAT IMAGINATION HAS A GREAT SHARE IN THE CAUSE OF THIS SENSATION AS WELL AS THE OTHERS AND THENCE HE FALLS UPON AN ACCOUNT OF ANOTHER SENSE WHICH HE BRINGS UNDER THIS HEAD WHICH HE CALLS LA CHATOUILMENT DE LAMOUR OF WHICH HE GIVES A FLORID DESINITION TASTING IS HIS NEXT SUBJECT WHEREIN AS IN THE FOREGOING CHAPTER HE HAS DRAWN TOGETHER THE SEVERAL SECTIONS RELATING TO IT AS AN ACCOUNT OF THE OR GANS OF TASTE THE MECHANISM OF SAVOURS AND THE MANNER OF THEIR BEING VARIED INTO COMPOUND TASTES HIS COMPARISON HERE IS NEW HE SAYS SINCE THE PRIN CIPLES OF SAVOURS ARE SALTS BOTH FIXED AND VOLATILE THAT WATER EARTH AND SULPHUR SERVE TO MAKE THE GREAT VARIETY AND DIFFERENT KINDS THAT ARE IN TASTE JUST AS SHADOWS VARIOUSLY MINGLED WITH LIGHT FORM DIFFERENT APPEARANCES NOT THAT THE SHADOW IS CAPABLE OF MAKING AN IMPRESSION UPON OUR ORGANS OF SIGHT BUT THE LIGHT ALONE AS THE SALTS ALONE ARE UPON OUR ORGANS OF TASTE HE HAS ALSO SOME REASONING UPON THE DIFFERENCE THAT IS IN MENS APPETITES TO SOME EAT ABLES WHICH WERE BEFORE DISAGREEABLE HIS REASON IS NOT THAT THE ORGANS DIFFER AT ANY TIME FROM WHAT THEY ALWAYS WERE BUT BECAUSE THE SOUL SOMETIMES CHANGES HER IDEAS EVEN FROM THE SAME IMPRESSIONS AND THAT THEREFORE THERE CAN BE NO IDEAS ESSENTIAL TO ANY IMPRESSIONS OR AT LEAST THAT THERE ARE NONE WHICH THE SOUL CANNOT CHANGE HE ALSO SAYS THAT IMAGINATION IS MUCH CONCERNED IN THE VARIATION OF TASTES THE266 THE SENSE OF SMELLING IS DISCUSSED IN HIS THIRD CHAPTER WHEREIN HE OBSERVES THE SAME METHOD AS IN THE TWO FORMER IN DESCRIBING THE MECHANISM OF THE ORGANS SERVING TO THAT SENSE AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE CONVEYANCE OF ODOURS TO THOSE ORGANS AND FOR THE STIMULUS OF SOME ODORIFEROUS PARTICLES CAUSING TEARS TO FLOW AS WELL AS SNEEZING CAUSED BY A GLARING LIGHT AND AFTER MAKING SOME REFLECTIONS ON THE MANY EFFECTS OF SMELLS UPON THE HUMAN BODY AND THE EXQUISITE SENSE OF SMELLING IN SOME ANIMALS HE RECITES THE STORY TOLD BY SIR K DIGBY OF THE BOY BROUGHT UP IN A FOREST WHOSE SMELL WAS SO EXQUISITE AS TO PERCEIVE THE APPROACH OF ENEMIES AND WARN HIS PARENTS OF THEM OUR AUTHOR FOUND THIS STORY CLE GANTLY TOLD AND REASONED UPON IN MONSIEUR VERDUCS BOOK CALLED USAGE DES PARTIES HE ALSO MENTIONS THE PERFECTION OF SMELLING IN THE INHABITANTS OF THE ANTIBES WHO CAN RUN A MAN UPON THE NOSE LIKE AN HOUND AND CONCLUDES THIS SECTION WITH A RELATION OF A FRIER OF PRAGUE FROM THE JOURNALS DES SCAVANS WHO COULD NOT ONLY DISTINGUISH DIFFERENT PERSONS FROM EACH OTHER BY SMELLING BUT ALSO AN INCONTINENT WO MAN FROM A CHASTE ONE AND ADDS IN A JOKING STRAIN THAT THIS MAN HAD BEGUN A TREARISE OF ODOURS BEFORE HE DIED WHICH THE JOURNALISTS MUCH REGRETTED THE LOSS OF BUT SAYS MONSIEUR LE CAT FOR MY PART I DO NOT KNOW BUT A PERSON SO EXQUISITE IN THIS KIND OF KNOWLEDGE WOULD BE DANGEROUS IN SOCIETY HE PROCEEDS NEXT TO TREAT OF HEARING AND BRINGS UNDER THAT HEAD THE WHOLE MECHANISM AND DOCTRINE OF SOUNDS THE VIBRATIONS OF ALL SOUNDING BODIES AND FROM THE EXPERIMENT OF HOLDING A CANDLE NEAR ANY VIBRATING OR SOUNDING BODY WITHOUT THE FLAMES BEING267 BEING MOVED OR OTHERWAYS AFFECTED HE ARGUES THAT THE COMMON AIR DOCS NOT PRODUCE THE SOUND BUT A MORE SUBTIL FLUID BETTER PROPORTIONED TO THE OR GANS OF HEARING HERE HE RUNS INTO A DETAIL OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHORDS AND TONES OF MUSIC AND MAKES A NEW AND CURIOUS COMPARISON BETWEEN THE PRINCIPAL COLOURS IN THE RAYS OF LIGHT AND THE FORE SAID FLUID WHICH IS MORE OR LESS SUBTIL IN THE AIR SOME PARTICLES OF WHICH ARE ONLY CAPABLE OF BEING MOVED TO EXPRESS LOW TONES OTHER HIGHER AND SO ON SUCCESSIVELY AS FAR AS THE COMPASS OF MUSIC REACHES JUST AS THE LIGHT IS COMPOSED OF CERTAIN KINDS OF RAYS SOME OF WHICH PRODUCE RED SOME GREEN C THIS BEING SUPPOSED SAYS HE IT MAY BE CONCEIVED THAT EVERY TONE WILL MOVE THE FLUID THAT IS PROPER TO ITSELF AND BY THAT MEANS THE EAR MAY RECEIVE AT ONCE THE IMPRESSIONS OF EVERY FLUID AS THE EYE RECEIVES THE IMPULSIONS OF SEVERAL COLOURED RAYS AT THE SAME INSTANT HE ADDS TO THIS BY WAY OF REASONING THAT WHEN A SINGLE INFERREDSTRINGINFERRED OF AN INSTRU MENT IS TOUCHED THOUGH THE GENERALITY OF MANKIND CAN DISTINGUISH BUT ONE TONE WHICH HE CALLS THE FUNDAMENTAL SOUND YET PEOPLE ACCUSTOMED TO HAR MONY CAN DISTINGUISH BESIDES AN OCTAVE A FIFTH AND A THIRD COVERED BY THIS FUNDAMENTAL TONE FOR THE OCTAVE IS HALF THAT SOUND OR THE PRODUCE OF HALF THE STRING THE FIFTH IS THE PRODUCE OF TWOTHIRDS AND THE THIRD IS THE PRODUCE OF FOURFIFTHS OF THE SAME STRING HE PROCEEDS TO REASON UPON THIS IN AN AGREEABLE MANNER AND CONCLUDES HIS ABOVEMENTIONED COM PARISON TO THIS PURPOSE THUS THERE ARE IN THE VI BRATED STRING ALL THE HARMONIES OR CHORDS AT ONCE WHICH268 WHICH COMPOSE THE FUNDAMENTAL SOUND BY VIBRATING EACH ITS PARTICULAR PROPER FLUID AT THE SAME TIME JUST AS THE ASSEMBLAGE OF ALL THE DIFFERENT PRIMITIVE CO LOURED RAYS MEETING TOGETHER MAKES THE WHITE CO LOUR OR LIGHT AND SO THE EAR OF A GOOD MUSICIAN IS A KIND OF PRISM WHICH CAN SEPARATE AND DISTINGUISH THE SOUNDS OR TONES FROM EACH OTHER IN THE FUNDA MENTAL SOUND HE GIVES AN ANATOMICAL DESCRIPTION OF THE ORGANS OF HEARING AND HAS ADDED SOME GOOD FIGURES OF THE EXTERNAL AND INTERNAL PARTS OF THE EAR WITH THE EUSTACHIAN TUBE MUCH AFTER THE MANNER OF DU VERNEY HE HAS ALSO THE FIGURE OF AN INSTRUMENT PAGE 292 TO HELP THOSE THAT ARE HARD OF HEARING WHICH HE CLAIMS THE INVENTION OF THE PARTICULAR FORM OF THIS INSTRUMENT MAY BE NEW TO THE AUTHOR YET WE HAVE HAD OF THIS KIND IN USE MANY YEARS IN ENGLAND FOR THE SAME PURPOSE HE FINISHES THIS SECTION WITH SOME REFLECTIONS UPON A YOUNG MAN OF A TOWN CALLED CHARTRES WHO WAS BORN DEAF AND DUMB AND WHOSE HEARING SUDDENLY CAME TO HIM AND WHO SPOKE SOME MONTHS AFTER IN THIS PLACE HE HAS A VERY GOOD FIGURE OF THE BASIS CEREBRI BY A TRANSVERSE SECTION THROUGH THE FRONTAL SINUSES A LITTLE ABOVE THE EYES AND CONTINUED THROUGH THE TEMPORAL BONES DEMON STRATING THE ORIGINATIONS AND EXIT OF THE NERVES WITH THE CONJUNCTION OF THE VERTEBRAL AND CAROTID ARTERIES ACCORDING TO THE DISSECTION OF THE FAMOUS WILLIS AND THEN PROCEEDS TO HIS LAST SECTION WHICH TREATS OF SEEING THIS SECTION IN A WORD IS ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE AND ALL THE PHAENOMENA OF VISION HE BEGINS IT WITH THE DOCTRINE OF LIGHTS AND COLOURS MAKING USE269 USE OF MANY EXPERIMENTS AND EXPLANATIONS OF THE GREAT SIR ISAAC NEWTON HAVING ALSO ADDED SEVERAL OF HIS OWN BESIDES SOME LITTLE CAVILS A MERE JEU DES MOTS AGAINST THAT GREAT MANS DOCTRINE OF ATTRACTION TO WHICH HE PREFERS THE IMPULSION OF CARTESIUS HE QUOTES AGAINST SIR ISAAC M DE FONTAINE M BANNIER AND M VOLTAIRE AND AS OUR YOUNG AUTHOR HAD A MIND TO OPPOSE THE OPINIONS OF ONE OF THE GREATEST ABILITIES IN THE SCIENCES COMMON PRUDENCE SHOULD HAVE INFORMED HIM THAT THE NAME NEWTON BESPEAKS THE GREATEST MODESTY AND DIFFIDENCE IN THE ATTEMPT OUR AUTHOR AMUSES HIMSELF THUS AGAINST THAT PRINCE OF PHILOSOPHERS WHICH IS THE MORE STRANGE SINCE IF HE HAD WROTE NOTHING ON THE SUBJECT MONSIEUR LE CAT WOULD HAVE WANTED A GREAT PART OF HIS FURNITURE FOR THIS SECTION THE PRINCIPAL AUTHORS BESIDES REGARDING ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY WHICH OUR AUTHOR SEEMS TO HAVE HAD IN HIS VIEW ARE DU VERNEY WILLIS SYNAC UPON HEISTER AND VERDUCS EXCELLENT BOOK LUSAGE DES PARTIES HOWEVER THIS TREATISE OF THE SENSES IS JUDICIOUSLY COMPILED NOR DOES IT WANT SEVERAL IN GENIOUS EMBELLISHMENTS FROM THE AUTHOR BESIDES THE OPINIONS OF SEVERAL OTHERS WE MAY THEREFORE CON CLUDE IT TO BE A VERY USEFUL BOOK O O X OB

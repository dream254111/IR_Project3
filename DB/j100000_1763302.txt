The results obtained were entirely confirmatory of the socalled num berhabit and it is clear that this varying pre dilection for different numbers materially vitiates all reasoning based on the assumption that we shall indifferently choose any number Not only are particular numbers favored but there are decided tendencies to select numbers on certain principles here again the results first reached by Dr Minot are corroborated For ex ample in 1120 trials in which multiple6 of ten would have been selected 109 times by the action of chance they were actually selected 307 times When persons were asked to choose a number no limits being set it was found that in 172 trials 84 chose numbers under 20 and 59 of these num bers under 10 Yet if you set 1000 as the limit unconsciously implied by each person numbers under 20 would occur only 326 and under 10 only 154 times Again when limits were set to the numbers to be thought of there was a strong dis position to avoid early numbers and select those near the farthest limits The table recording the result of the numbers persons are most likely to choose is very suggestive and should be com pared with the tables given in Dr Minots report In short as was recognized long ago by some psychologists and writers on probabilities the human mind is not calculated to act like a diebox or a rafflingwheel and to have numbers chosen is a different thing from having them drawn In fact it is possible to suggest a certain kind of numberpreference by the framing of the question When the question read  Choose a number con taining three figures the digit 3 occurred more than twice as often as it should have done by the action of chance Of course this phenomenon is not confined to numbers guessing letters of the alphabet names of people and towns and the like would be very apt to be unusually successful by reason of independent similar brainfunction ing In choosing letters three tendencies are ob served 1 to choose A B and C of 172 people 37 chose A 31 B and 14 C 2O to choose ones own initial this was done 27 times in 172 cases 3 to choose Z 12 times in 172 cases The arguments in favor of supersensory thought transferrence would apply as well to the common simultaneous discovery of new points in science by widely separated observers or even to the similarity in customs of unrelated savage tribes which Mr Tylor so interestingly describes and so rationally explains as to the numbercoincidences of the usual telepathic experiments The same causes that led to the development of the decimal VOL IX No 209 system or to the selection of certain numbers as sacred or illomened are still active in creating the preference for certain numbers which is so easily overlooked Experiments taking this factor into account can be devised and when the results still leave a residue of unexplained phenomena it is time enough to begin to consider the remote possibility of real telepathy J J IS BOTANY A SUITABLE STUDY FOR YOUNG MEN 1 AN idea seems to exist in the minds of some young men that botany is not a manly study that it is merely one of the ornamental branches suitable enough for young ladies and effeminate youths but not adapted for ablebodied and vigor ousbrained young men who wish to make the best use of their powers I wish to show that this idea is wholly unfounded but that on the contrary botany ought to be ranked as one of the most useful and most manly of studies and an important if not an indispensable part of a wellrounded education In support of this view these four good and cogent reasons can be ad duced  1 The study of botany is an admirable mental discipline Any education is defective which in cludes no training in the scientific method of study that is in developing the powers of care ful minute observation and comparison in some departmlent of nature By this means is acquired the habit of investigation or the seekingout of natures mysteries by the use of ones own senses instead of trusting wholly to the observations of others This method of study may be learned through any branch of science but botany pre sents this advantage that it can be pursued with less inconvenience and less expense than any other The mental training which botany affords is very thorough The details of plantstructure are infinite and essential peculiarities are often so hidden as to be recognized only by the most mi nute investigation This involves the use of the microscope which every educated man ought to understand since it reveals to the eye a newly discovered and wonderful world  a world of which our grandfathers had but the faintest glimpses but which is scarcely inferior in interest to that larger world which the unaided eye can see After this training of the powers of per ception and comparison comes the process of generalization whereby the laws of vegetable life are determined from the study of plant forms and modes of growth Thus is acquired the habit of 1 From the first number of The Swiss CrossFEBRUARY 4 1887 SCIEi inductive reasoning or the supporting of every general proposition upon a solid foundation of positive indisputable fact Learning the names of plants is but the begin ning of the study of botany It is like learning the names of our companions or schoolmates be fore we become really acquainted with them After we have learned to tell plants apart and to call them by name we have presented for study such problems as the laws governing their dis tribution the relation between the florae of dif ferent continents and the relation of variety to species which introduces the subject of Darwin ism The study of botany also includes the fossil plants and by enabling us to trace the vegetable kingdom from its first appearance upon the earth through all the varying conditions of the geologic ages opens those tremendous scientific questions as to the birth and infancy of this world of ours which we now see in its maturity and as to what it will become in its old age These researches afford not only the amplest mental training but abundant occupation for the longest life 2 The study of botany promotes physical devel opment The botanical student must be a walker and his frequent tramps harden his muscles and strengthen his frame He must strike off across the fields penetrate the woods to their secret depths scramble through swamps and climb the hills The fact that he walks with an earnest purpose gives a zest to these rambles and he comes home proud and happy from his successful search for botanical treasures with a keen appetite and an invigorated body and mind He has en joyed himself more thoroughly and gained more substantial benefit than those who have devoted the same time to the bat the racket or the bi cycle In his vacations the young botanist can toughen himself by making long and delightful excursions living all summer in the open air and may even have opportunities for joining govern ment exploring parties and enjoying the active outofdoor life full of adventure and useful ex perience 3 The study of botany is of great practical utility It is an essential preparation for several important pursuits The physician and pharma cist need to have a practical knowledge of those plants which are used as medicines and if this knowledge is not acquired in early life the oppor tunity never afterward presents itself For the protection of our rapidly dwindling forests the services of many skilled foresters will soon be required and the forester must be a practical botanist So must also the horticulturist whether professional or amateur For the most accom plished botanists who desire to make this their NCE 117 lifework there will always be places as instruct ors in our many colleges 4 The study of botany is a source of lifelong happiness Whatever may be ones station or pursuit in life it is a great thing to have an in tellectual hobby which will afford agreeable and elevating occupation in all leisure hours Botany is one of the best of hobbies It can be studied out of doors from early spring till the snow falls and even in winter there is plenty to be done in the analysis of dried specimens and the care of the herbarium The botanist lives in the fresh air and sunshine and when he leaves the world behind and seeks amid the solitudes of Nature to penetrate her wondrous mysteries he feels the quickenings of a higher life A taste for botany wonderfully enhances the pleasures of travel and also gives happiness and content to him who stays at home It is equally efficacious in preventing the ennui of wealth and the anxieties of poverty If ones surroundings are uncongenial and life proves full of cares and disappointments it is a great solace to be able to say with Aurora Leigh  I was not therefore sad My soul was singing at a work apart For these reasons it is obvious that the study of botany is peculiarly rich in those elements which conduce to a vigorous mind and body and a robust character It is therefore preeminently a manly study and an invaluable part of a young mans education The student may rest assured that the time and effort devoted to it are well spent for the result will be to make him a wiser stronger more useful and happier man J F A ADAMS MD THE TENDENCY OF CONTEMPORARY GERMAN THOUGHT ROBERT ZIMMERMANN writing of contemporary German literature in the Athenaeum expresses the following opinion as to the philosophic tendency in Germany   Scientific men particularly physiologists and anthropologists whose problems involuntarily touch on the domain of philosophy and in par ticular of psychology are yielding to a spiritual istic impulse that attracts them beyond the limits of the material The science of man according to the opinion prevalent among naturalists is a chapter in zoology The  Entwicklungsgeschichte des menschlichen Geistes by Gustav Hauffe of which the first part previously published contains Anthropology traces back the essence of mans nature to an absolute and indissoluble union of the corporeal with the psychic element the spiritual soul with the material body  a method that re

nomics in that portion of it which deals with farmlabor and its wages Curiously enough the result of the May I888 investiga tion of wages of farmlabor is almost identical with that of three years ago The changes are very slight though local differences occur the averages of the geographical sections or groups of States being changed very little The average rate per month where the laborer boards himself is a few cents lower in the Middle and Western States and in California and a very little higher in the South and in New England The highest rates obtained in I866 in the Northern and Western States In California and in the South there was a positive advance between that date and I869 The investigation of 1875 a year or two after the monetary crisis ap peared showed decline in each section which continued for several years culminating in I879 the date of lowest prices of all Ameri can farmproducts The decline from I866 to I879 amounted to 39 per cent in the Eastern States 35 in the Middle 30 in the West ern States and I7 in the Southern States In California the rate of averages was well sustained rising at first but standing in I879 higher than in i866 By a carefully constructed diagram Mr Dodge shows the course of prices for more than twenty years and the diagram is a forcible picture of the fearful depression caused by the six years of panic from which a slow recovery began in I879 The sharp decline from I886 except in California where the highest point after the war is noted in I869 is a fall from an era of inflation in which speculative values were all the higher from being stated in a depre ciated currency The present values appear to be on a more nat ural and stable basis The rise was coincident with the return to specie payments and the natural level was reached by a bound as soon as the pressure which depressed was removed It is curious to note further that at the lowest ebb of wages rates were higher in the West than in the Middle States and slightly above the lowest point reached in the Eastern States because the soil was still cultivated and crops were grown in their usual quantity while much of the manufacturing industry was suspended This West ern line of wages would not have dipped so low but for the immi gration to the West of Eastern operatives and artisans out of work seeking employment and future homes There is a sufficiency of farmlabor in this country as a whole with a comparatively even balance between the geographical divis ions There are localities in perhaps every State where scarcity exists and others having a superabundance There is in some places a scarcity of agricultural labor caused by demand at higher wages for labor in some specific local industry There is reported now as always heretofore a tendency to exercise distinctive pref erences and encourage peculiar aptitudes for professions and avocations outside of agriculture generally leading away from the country to the town or city A temporary disturbance of the re lation between demand and supply is found in some localities as a result of a somewhat rapid change in the character of the rural in dustries pursued Where general farming has been partly replaced by an extension of pastoral industry the effect has been to reduce the demand for labor but in other cases there is a notable increase in gardening and fruitgrowing which occasion a large increase in the labor required for the cultivation of a given area The con tinued development of truckfarming near many of the navigable waters and some of the railroadlines of the South affords a con spicuous example of the latter class of changes A considerable number of reports from the more Atlantic coast States and from some farther West mention the migration of laborers as a cause of a noticeable reduction in the supply of labor Usually the movement is simply a part of the general westward drift of population but there are some movements of a more limited and special character In Mississippi for example the reports from certain counties mention the departure of many colored laborers to the richer lands of the Mississippi bottoms or of the Yazoo delta and a similar movement from a thin upland soil to riverbottom lands is also mentioned by some correspondents in Louisiana and Arkansas Some reports from Virginia and North Carolina mention the departure of many colored people for the North Others from the same and other States refer to a move ment southward Some Alabama reports mention a movement of colored laborers to settle on public land in that State as home steaders One North Carolina report that from Cabarrus County states that forty colored men had left for California but the labor supply in the neighborhood from which they had gone was still sufficient In some localities however a considerable deficiency is reported as a result of such migrations THE CONTEST in the New York City Board of Education has resulted in the reelection of Mr Jasper as superintendent by a vote of twelve to nine and the political ring whose servant he is is ju bilant It is safe to say however that the triumph is but a tem porary one for public opinion is arousing and a public education society has been formed for the purpose of carrying on the agita tion The leading educators of the city representative clergymen and lawyers and not a few of the wouldbe progressive public school teachers met on Saturday last and laid the foundations for the new society It will if we understand aright take up the task of educating public opinion and possibly will demand the appoint ment of a commission to investigate the schools and report a plan or plans for their improvement This would be an excellent step more especially as the present mayor enjoys the fullest confidence of the community and could be safely trusted to appoint a commis sion that would do its work thoroughly and well An attempt should also be made to displace the ringsters whose terms expire this year with better men Four of the seven whose terms expire in December should on no account be reappointed The importance of this is well understood and already representative citizens like Dr Mary Putnam Jacobi and Col R T Auchmuty are suggested for the vacancies The Springfield Mass Repztblican in commenting on the condi tion of affairs says that  the reelection of John Jasper as superin tendent of the public schools of New York was a foregone conclu sion The Board of Education was as much on trial as the super intendent himself The board exercises many of the prerogatives which in other cities belong to the superintendent and it could not     280 SCIENCE be expected that it would pass a vote morally condemning its own acts In the next place the opposition or more properly speaking the true friends of education in New York began their attack by first selecting a candidate whose reputation experience and force of character were not equal to the tremendous work of reforming the present vicious system of instruction The large results of the investigation of Mr Jaspers records will appear next year when he will be confronted by a rival candidate as well as his own record The public has now been informed of the sad situation and will be prepared for serious work when the next two years close and another election of superintendent takes place When Mr Kiddle withdrew and Mr Jasper took the New York schools in hand the change was noticed at once The teachers were all put in the po sition of wheels contributing to a nicety to the general movement and the product was a machinemade pupil The perfect exami nation was very much on a par with Showman Forepaughs trick elephant If one teacher undertook to feed the starved minds of the little ones then there was trouble with the machine and the teacher was subdued Every word of this is true and is in full accord with the position that Sczence has taken in this important matter If the Public Education Society does its full duty the sit uation will be materially altered before another election takes place THE LONDON PUBLISHERS and printers are getting more and more excited over the provision of the Chace international copy right bill which requires a foreign book copyrighted in this country to be printed from types set up in the United States The print ing and allied trades section of the London Chamber of Commerce has sent a resolution to the Chamber of Commerce asking the government to obtain by diplomatic means the withdrawal of the objectionable provision and if this is not done demanding that a similar law be passed in England What the English publishers and printers desire is an opportunity to make all books written or compiled in Great Britain and sold in the American markets That is something that the Congress of the United States will never agree to if the passage of an international copyright act is post poned a quarter of a century England may prevent books printed in America from being sold in Great Britain but will never suc ceed in dictating in what shape a law shall be passed by the Con gress of the United States until the former raises a generation of abler diplomatists than she has lately sent abroad AN ITEM PUBLISHED in the Washington papers last Satur day entitled  The Army Ahead in which it is represented that competitive tests of the  indications  work of the Signal Office to determine the relative merits of military and civilian officers in the performance of this work had been made is likely to mislead any one who has not read the description of the present condition of affairs in the Signal Office published in the last issue of Science The predictions for February were made by Lieutenant Dunwoody and those for March by Prof Cleveland Abbe The percentages of verifications for each month have been computed by Professor Marvin who found the record as follows Professor Abbe indica tions 7542 per cent stormsignals 6250 per cent coldwave sig nals 5399 per cent Lieutenant Dunwoody indications 8055 per cent stormsignals 8929 per cent coldwave signals 86i i per cent It should be remembered that years ago when the weather reports became most popular and there were nothing but compliments for its predictions Professor Abbe then in thorough practice prepared the indications for a long time Of late he has been engaged in an entirely different line of scientific work and it was not to be ex pected that he would be as successful in preparing indications as an officer who had lately been engaged in that service General Greelys purpose in putting Professor Abbe upon this duty at all was to train civilians for it in case Congress as seemed more than probable should transfer the weather bureau to a civil department VOL XI No 280 THE CRENITIC HYPOTHESIS AND MOUNTAIN BUILDING THE facts derived from the study of metamorphic rocks and vol canic phenomena make it evident that there are two types of mo tion which take place in the deeperburied materials of the earths crust One of these classes of movements occurs when volcanic ejecta creep horizontally towards the vent or when the materials which afford the support of mountainarches undergo massive movements towards the base of such folds in the rocks In these cases of horizontal movements we have translations of extensive bodies of matter for considerable distances The other class of movements taking place in the crust are in a vertical direction They are brought up in part by the action of water and in part by the action of igneous forces The operation of these agents leads to a very extensive transfer of material in a vertical path from the deeperburied to the more superficial strata I propose in the fol lowing pages to consider the general effect of this upward move ment of matter upon mountainbuilding The simple inspection of most mountainbuilt districts will show the observer that there has been a very extensive movement of ma terials from lower to higher levels in the crust in such areas Tak ing a considerable surface of mountainous country where by chance the bedrocks are exposed to view we almost always find in such regions numerous veins and dikes Thus in the anticlinal districts of New England especially where those portions of the surface are exposed along the seashore we are often able to ascer tain that on the path traversed by a straight line a mile in length the addition to the material in the more superficial rocks has been sufficient to produce a considerable extension of their area In some sections having this length I have been able to prove that the increase in the horizontal section due to the introduction of the materials derived from below amounts to as much as from ten to twenty per cent of the original area or in other words on a line a mile in length the dikes and veins occupy from onetenth to one fifth of the distance Besides the distinct intrusions of matter in the form of dikes and veins there have in many instances been large contributions to the more elevated parts of the crust through the interstitial contributions of crystalline material Thus in some of our highly metamorphosed rocks where the materials have as sumed the crystalline structure a progressive growth of the horn blendic and other aggregations has been observed  so that besides the contributions of matter which we may reckon from a study of dikes and veins there is often a large but incomputable element of crystalline growth serving to extend the rocks which is not readily to be taken into account The immediate causes of this transfer of material from the deeperlying to the more superficial parts of the earths crust are now tolerably well known In large measure it is due to the pe culiar effect of temperature upon the water which was enclosed in the sedimentary rocks at the time of their formation or which may have penetrated into them from the surface The process of burial be neath sedimentary formed accumulations acts in all cases to lift the temperature of all the rocks which are subjected to such cover ing Where these rocks contain the waters of deposition they are likely in time to be brought to a high degree of heat The tem perature to which they attain and the pressure to which they are subjected enable them to dissolve a large share of the materials with which they come in contact Moving upward in the chan nels which may be opened by chance riftings of the superimposed strata these waters deprived of their power to retain the materials in solution by the loss of temperature in their upward journey and the relinquishment of pressure which comes about at the same time lay down deposits in the upper portions of the crust In a similar manner the descending pluvial waters obtain in the deeper parts of the crust a store of dissolved materials which on their re ascent is likewise deposited in the higher rocks Thus the move ments of water below the drainagelevel of the country inevitably operate to bring from below and deposit in the upper parts of the crust large amounts of mineral matter The nature of the forces which urge dikestones from the deeper to the more elevated parts of the crust are not so clear as those in volved in the formation of veins It seems not unlikely that it is to

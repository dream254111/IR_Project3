Members of the Eighteenth Educational Conference of Acade mies and High Schools in Relations with the University of Chicago The Commission of Twentyone appointed two years ago to con sider the propositions specified on p 2 of the program presented to the Seventeenth Educational Conference three independent reports from the point of view of the elementary school the high school and the college respectively By your action taken one year ago you referred these several reports to the commission as a whole adding to the twentyone persons already appointed the President of the University as chairman and requested the commission to unify these several statements and to report to your body definite recom mendations along the line of these propositions The report of the special committee representing the elementary school made one year ago advocated in substance a sevenyear elementaryschool course The special committee representing the high school indicated in its report the work that should be done in a sixyear highschool course in order to prepare students to enter the junior year of college The report of the special committee repre senting the college made no direct recommendation It was understood by your commission that you expected a careful consideration of these reports and if possible certain definite con clusions in the form of recommendations But we desire to state that in the progress of our work we have found that the questions involved are of a most difficult and fundamental character and that the data on the basis of which conclusions may be reached are few 23THE SCHOOL REVIEW and indefinite It is the opinion of your commission that these ques tions are of a kind which may not be settled on a priori considerations that in this field as in others the inductive method must be employed and many experiments undertaken and still further that only after a considerable period of time will it be possible to reach results that may be regarded as welltested and satisfactory Your attention is invited to the fact that not a few experiments have already been initiated some of which have been presented to you in the addresses of the morning Your commission find as a result of their study of the subject connected with these propositions that among other questions the following require to be investigated namely I Is the present policy of differentiation between the elementary and secondary schools desirable or should an effort be made toward greater unification in method and organization 2 Should the elementary school correspond to the period of childhood and therefore should it provide for six years of school work from the ages of six to twelve years instead of eight years as at present  3 Should the secondary school correspond to the period of youth and should it therefore provide for six years of school work from the ages of thirteen to eighteen instead of four years as at present  4 What revision of the curricula of the elementary and secondary schools and what changes in methods of teaching can be made that will contribute to economy of time and efficiency of work  5 In order to secure a wellbalanced development and at the same time to contribute to the economy of time can the school year be lengthened advantageously and minor vacations be more equally distributed  6 Under what limitations should high schools undertake to do the work of the first two college years  Your commission recommend that you appoint for the investiga tion of these questions during the coming year a new commission of fifteen persons representing the different interests concerned and that this new commission be directed to report the results of their work in printed form to the individual members of this conference not later than June i with the understanding that these different answers 24EIGHTEENTH EDUCATIONAL CONFERENCE shall constitute the basis of the Saturday morning discussion of the Nineteenth Educational Conference of

better index to the increasing popular interest in trees than the appearance of numerous books and aids to their identification Since I900 about twenty such books have appeared While nearly all of them describe other characters more or less fully the chief distinguishing characters in all but one of the books are the leaves This restricts the study of trees to five months in the year The opportunity for teachers is still more restricted for when the leaves I Read at the conference of the Departments of Botany and Zoology 25

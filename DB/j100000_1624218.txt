PHYSIOGRAPHY ANNUAL RANGE OF TEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN SURFACE THE annual range of temperature in the lower atmosphere first clearly charted by Supan Zeitschr fir wissensch Geogr 1880 and more recently by Conolly see my Elementary Meteorology fig 18 is recognized as an important climatic factor and the distribution of its larger and smaller values brings forward several in teresting physiographical generalizations Dr G Schott now presents a similar chart for the annualrange of temperature of the ocean surface Pet Mitt July 1895 from which it appears that the maximum range 15 to 20 C occurs on latitude 40 N next east of the continents Belts of large range 5 to 7 in the southern hemisphere 8 to 12 in the northern hemisphere run around the oceanic world about 38 north and south that is under the belt of high atmosphere pressure and prevailingly clear skies and small ranges are generally found around the equator 1 to 3 and in high latitudes 2 in the far southern ocean 4 to 6 in the far north Dr Schott ascribes the maxi mum ranges to the oscillation of cold and warm currents and to this the contrast be tween the offshore winds of summer and winter by Nova Scotia and Corea may fairly be added Locally increased ranges on the equator up to 5 or 6 west of Africa and South America are explained by the weaker and stronger flow of the 127 South Atlantic and South Pacific eddies in the southern summer and winter WINDS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN THE mean strength of the winds over the Pacific Ocean is discussed by K6ppen in the Annalen der Hydrographie July and Au gust 1895 in preparation for the publica tion of a Segelhandbuch The velocities without regard to directions are presented in tabular form and in charts for the oppo site seasons of JanuaryFebruary and July August Apart from the practical value of these results to navigation they present interesting features characteristic of the planetary and terrestrial schemes of atmos pheric circulation Where the material is most plentiful one may easily recognize the weak winds and calms of the planetary sys tem around the equator between the steady trades on either side the frequency of calms again but also of stronger winds in the horse latitudes about 30 north and south and the rapid increase of strong winds in the higher latitudes of the pre vailing westerlies Terrestrial features ap pear in the annual migration of these wind belts not however symmetrically about the equator but about a medial line in perhaps 5 north latitude and also in the seasonal variation of the strength of the westerlies from over 4 Beaufort scale in summer to over 5 in winter in the northern temperate zone from over 5 to over 6 in the far southern zone The irregularities of the planetary belts and of the terrestrial migra tions may in great part be plausibly refer red to cyclonic disturbances but need much further investigation The light equatorial winds shift south of the equator only near Australia where monsoon winds and a sea sonal counter current may be searched for ABNORMAL AND SOLITARY WAVES REPORTS are not infrequently made of waves or  seas  of exceptional size erro JANUARY 24 1896N S VOL III No 56 neously called tidal waves by which vessels are overwhelmed on the open ocean C E Stromeyer gives brief account of some examples in Nature li 1895 437 describ ing them as strong enough to carry masts and funnels by the board and to smash bulwarks lifeboats and deck houses He suggests that the waves may be due to vol canic action in the submarine bank known as the Faraday reef northeast of New foundland for in a number of cases the course of the waves is away from the reef The same subject is continued by W Al lingham in the London Nautical Magazine Ixiv 1895 539545 many examples be ing given The Vancouver of the Dominion line was badly mauled by a solitary sea while crossing the North Atlantic in 1890 The Holyrood in June 1892 20N 35W encountered a solitary sea which looked like a wall of water as it approached it flooded the decks but before and after this sea broke the water was comparatively smooth under a light northeast trade wind The St Denis New York to Yokohama in September 1893 28 S 8 E was boarded by a solitary sea which swept her decks and carried away three seamen The Nor mannia 750 miles out from New York Jan uary 1894 suddenly encountered a sea running masthead high submerging the vessel up to her bridge and doing great damage Similar phenomena of smaller dimensions are reported on our great lakes So little is known of them that no satisfactory ex planation of their occurrence can be at present adopted W M DAVIs HARVARD UNIVERSITY TYPES OF LOWLAND COASTS As the opening paper to the Richthofen Jubilee volume Festschrift Ferdinand Freiherrn von Richthofen von seinen Schiilern Berlin 1893 Dr Alfred Philipp son of Bonn contributed a discussion of type forms of coasts particularly of alluvial coasts Uber die Typen der Kiistenformen insbesondere der Schwemmlandkiisten Under  die ciiste he includes a zone on either side of the shoreline He describes as  Isohypsenkiisten  those coastal forms which have been produced by the various constructional processes such as deform ation depression of land uplift of sea bot tom volcanic and glacial aggradation These forms vary so greatly that one can make of them as many types as one pleases The present writer prefers to call this class of shore forms  Constructional for in cases of tilted or warped crustal movement the new shoreline does not coincide with a former contour Isophypse Philippson recognizes that development must follow the constructional stage and coastal irreg ularity from differential marine erosion is therefore explained and the tminute forms of beach profile are illustrated with five diagrams He amplifies with illustrations his terms potamogenous or rivermade and thalassogenous or seamade coasts first in troduced in connection with his work on Greece Though he introduces the idea of systematic change in the geographic form of coasts as in incompletely potamogen ous  and completely potamogenous  al luvial coasts he does not fully carry out this idea and make a systematic account of all successive stages of development It would make the comprehension of the vari ous forms of coasts much easier to intro duce the terms already applied to land forms and speak of a coast as young adolescent or mature F P G CURRENT NOTES ON ANTHROPOLOGY SKIN PAINTING IN SOUTH AMERICA AT the last session of the Italian Geo graphical Congress an

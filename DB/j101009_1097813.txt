which we call attention in connection with the principal case LONG V PENCES COMMITTEE Supreme Court of Appeals At Staunton September 24 1896 1 MOTIONS TO RECOVER MONEYAssignee against remote assignor Under the provisions of sec 2861 of the Code an action may be maintained by an assignee of a chose in action against a remote assignor thereof to recover money upon the contract implied by the assignment that lie will repay the consideration received by him for the chose if by the use of due diligence it cannot be made out of the obligor or maker Hence under the very terms of sec 3211 of the Code an assignee may proceed by motion against a remote assignor for a like recovery 2 ASSIGNOR AND ASSIGNEESuit on assignmentEvidence of assignmentJudg ment In a proceeding by an assignee of a note against a remote assignor to recover on the contract implied by the assignment the note is a necessary piece of evidence for the plaintiff in order to prove the assignment and also to show the measure of the plaintiffs recovery for in the absence of proof to the contrary the law presumes that the assignor received for the note a sum equal to that specified in it The fact that the note was seen and inspected by the court need not be expressed in the entry of the judgment but the expres sion of it does not vitiate the judgment nor show that the judgment was rendered on the note and not on the contract implied from the assignment Reported by M P Burlks State Reporter 1896 607VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER 3 HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION Waiver  Assignment  Judgment  Harmless error The waiver of the homestead exemption in the body of a nonnegotiable note is only a waiver as to the particular obligation expressed in the body of the note and not as to the implied obligation growing out of an assignment of the note and as against the liability of the assignor to the assignee the former may claim the benefit of the exemption although the note declares that  the drawer and endorsers each hereby waive the benefit of our homestead ex emptions And in an action on the assignment by the assignee against the assignor the statement in the entry of the judgment that the homestead is waived does not vitiate the judgment The judgment in this respect will be amended and affirmed Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Rockingham county rendered October 16 1895 on a motion wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Amended and affirmed This was a proceeding by motion by an assignee against a remote assignor of a note which was conceded to be not negotiable because it did not appear on its face to be payable at a bank in this State The following is a copy of the note 123400 HARRISONBURG VA March 8th 1892 Two years after date we promise to pay to Daniel S Long or order one thous and two hundred and thirtyfour dollars with interest from date the interest to be paid annually at the end of each year for value received negotiable and paya ble at the First National Bank of Harrisonburg without offset and we the drawers and endorsers each hereby waive the benefit of our homestead exemption and all other exemptions as to this debt J W CARPENTER MARY E CARPENTER Endorsement on back of note Pay to the order of J W Click March 21 1892 I S LONG J W CLICK No evidence is certified in the record and no bill of exceptions

appears that notice of this motion has been duly executed being solemnly called came not Whereupon the notice and writing sued on being seen and inspected by the court it is therefore considered by the court that the plaintiff recover against the defendant twelve hundred and thirtyfour dollars with interest thereon 608 DecLONG V PENCES COMMITTE1 from the 8th day of March 1892 until paid and costs on an instrument waived the homestead Sipe  Harris for the plaintiff in error Wm L Yancey for the defendant in error RIELY J delivered the opinion of the court This case is before us upon a writ of error to a judgment rendered on a motion by the assignee of a promissory note against a remote assignor It was contended that the law does not authorize the proceeding by motion in a case of this kind Sec 3211 of the Code provides that any person entitled to recover money by action on any contract may on motion before any court which would have jurisdiction in an action otherwise than under section thirty two hundred and fifteen obtain judgment for such money    The statute thus authorizes the proceeding by motion whenever a per son is entitled to recover money in action on any contract The only restriction imposed by the statute as to the nature of the contract upon which the recovery may be by motion is the right to recover money upon it by action If the contract is such that the person mak ing the motion is entitled to recover money upon it by action he is entitled to proceed to do so by motion whether his right is based upon an expressed or implied contract The remedy exten s to all cases in which a person is entitled to recover money by action on contract Report of Revisors of Code of 1849 Vol 2 p 832 note and Hale v Chamberlain 13 Gratt 658 and 4 Minors Insts 3d ed p 633 Prior to the statute authorizing a recovery from an assignor an as signee had the right upon the principles of the common law to recover from his immediate assignor under the contract implied from the assign ment that the assignor would repay the consideration he had received for the chose in action assigned if payment thereof by the use of due diligence could not be obtained from the obligor or maker This im plied promise was not considered however to extend at law to any other than the immediate assignee and consequently no assignee could recover at law from a remote assignor Mackies Exor v Davis 2 Wash 219 Caton  Veale v Lenox 5 Rand 31 42 Mandeville  Jameson v Riddle  Co 1 Cranch 290 and Yeaton v Bank of Alex andria 5 Cranch 49 But although not assignable at law the implied contract was deemed transferable in equity and a court of equity would 1896 609VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER enforce it Riddle  Co v Mandeville  Jameson 5 Cranch 322 and Bank of U S v Weisiger 2 Peters 331 The statute sec 2861 of the Code provides that any assignee may recover from any assignor of such writing as is described in sec 2860 but that a remote assignor shall have thebenefit of the same defence as if the suit had been instituted by his immediate assignee The effect of the statute sec 2861 is to extend to a remote assignee the benefit of the promise implied by law from an assignor to his immediate as signee and to give to the remote assignee as well as to the immediate assignee the right to recover upon such implied promise The right which he previously had in equity the statute gives to him at law 2 Robinson new Pr 283 Drane v Scholfield 6 Leigh 395 The right of recovery is founded in every case upon the implied contract created by the assignment and the remedy for the enforcement of the right is the action of assumpsit 3 Robinsons New Prac 396 3 Minors Insts 2 ed 436 Arnold v Hickman 6 Munf 15 and Drane v Scholfield 6 Leigh 386 The proceeding by motion in the case at bar is on a contract upon which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover money by action and therefore comes within the very terms of the statute authorizing a re covery by motion It was also assigned as error that even if the court had the right to give judgment on the motion it did not have the right to give such a judgment as was entered The alleged ground of this objection is that the judgment does not conform to the cause of action set out in the notice and that the entry of the judgment shows that the court considered the note as the ground of the motion and not the implied liability created by the assignment This objection is more apparent than real The note was a necessary piece of evidence in support of the motion in order to prove the as signment It was also necessary to enable the court to fix the measure of the recovery for in the absence of proof to the contrary the law presumes that the assignor received for the note a sum equal to that specified in it 2 Rob New Prac 274 457 and 3 Minors Institutes 372 and 437 The motion being heard by the court it was necessary for it to inspect the note for these purposes and the statement of the fact of such inspection in the entry of the judgment which was wholly unnecessary is doubtless what gave rise to this objection But if tile court had entered the judgment in the formal manner contended for it would have been for the very same amount for which it was entered 610 DecLONG V PENCE S COMMITTEE It is right in substance if not technically right in form The infor mality is a harmless error and can work no possible injury to the plaintiff in error The informal entry of a judgment is not a ground for reversing it Code of Va sec 3449 A further objection was made to the judgment in that it declared in obedience to the requirement of the statute Acts 188990 p 117 that the homestead exemption was waived Waiver of the exemption prescribed by the Constitution and by Chap 178 of the Code is provided for in sec 3647 It reads so far as it is necessary to notice it as follows  If any person shall declare in a bond bill note or other instrument by which he is or may be come liable for the payment of money to another or by a writing thereon or annexed thereto that he waives as to such obligation the exemption from liability of the property or estate which he may be entitled to claim and hold exempt under the provisions of this chap ter the said property or estate whether previously set apart or not shall be liable to be subjected for said obligation under legal process in like manner and to the same extent as other property or estate of such person    It thus appears that the waiver is required to be in writing and must be expressed in the bond bill note or other writing itself which is the evidence of the obligation or by a writing thereon or annexed thereto and where it is so done the exemption is declared to be waived as to the said obligation There was such waiver in the body of the note referred to and it was expressed to be a waiver as to the endorsers as well as to the drawers makers of the note Strictly speaking the assignors were not endorsers but the waiver would perhaps be construed to include them according to the intention of the parties Yet if so the waiver was only as to the particular obligation expressed in the body of the note and not as to the implied obligation growing out of the assign ment which is the ground of the motion in this case The latter is a wholly different obligation The motion was not based upon the note Neither the note nor the obligation of which it is the evidence was the ground of the motion but it was as we have seen the implied obligation created by the assignment As to this implied obligation there was no waiver of the exemption and the court erred in so ad judging Such error is however not a ground for reversing the judgment but it may be amended in this respect And being so amended it must be affirmed Amended and affirmed 1896 611612 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec BY THE EDITORThe motion in this case which as shown by the court was clearly within the scope and meaning of sec 3211 of the Code was not on the note but on the assignment The Reporter in his statement gives a copy of the note which see It was conceded by counsel and considered by the court that the note was not negotiable according to our statute sec 2849 of the Code because on its face not payable in this State at a particular bank c This construction of the statute was anticipated by the REGISTER See 1 Va Law Reg note prepared by Associate IEditor Prof W M Lile at pp 155157 As to the right or privilege of waiver of exemption As we understand the de cision if the note had been negotiable the waiver in the body of it by the endorsers as well as the makers would have been effectual as to both for every endorser in such case accepts and adopts by his endorsement the waiver contained in the body of the note By the endorsement he undertakes to pay the note if the maker does not at its maturity provided there be due presentment and demand of pay ment at the proper time and place and on default by the maker due notice of such default be given to the endorser The conditions complied with the endorser be comes as much bound to pay the note as the maker is and the waiver as to the note extends to the endorser as well as the maker Hence the incorporation in negotiable notes of a waiver of exemption by the endorsers as is the custom is effectual as to them Not so however as to assignments of nonnegotiable notes The assignor is not bound by the note or by his assignment of it in the absence of a special agree ment to that effect to pay it as in the case of an endorser of a negotiable note His undertaking is to refund or repay the value of the consideration he has re ceived for the assignment if the assignee by the exercise of due diligence cannot recover the debt assigned The implied contract between the assignor and assignee of a nonnegotiable note is different and quite distinct from the contract between the maker and payee of such note and hence the waiver of exemption as to the obligation of the note does not embrace the obligation arising out of the assignment This was decided by the court The same rule would apply to the assignment of a bond or any other nonnegotiable instrument The distinction pointed out is of much importance in business transactions If an assignee as distinguished from an endorser desires to secure from his assignor a waiver of exemption he must provide for it in the assignment or by some writing thereon or annexed thereto as the statute requires The contract relations between assignor and assignee of a chose in action are discussed by W B Kegley Esq of the Wytheville Va bar ante p 559 et seq

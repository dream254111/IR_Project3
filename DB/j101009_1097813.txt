OF ERROR TO A JUDGMENT RENDERED ON A MOTION BY THE ASSIGNEE OF A PROMISSORY NOTE AGAINST A REMOTE ASSIGNOR IT WAS CONTENDED THAT THE LAW DOES NOT AUTHORIZE THE PROCEEDING BY MOTION IN A CASE OF THIS KIND SEC 3211 OF THE CODE PROVIDES THAT ANY PERSON ENTITLED TO RECOVER MONEY BY ACTION ON ANY CONTRACT MAY ON MOTION BEFORE ANY COURT WHICH WOULD HAVE JURISDICTION IN AN ACTION OTHERWISE THAN UNDER SECTION THIRTY TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN OBTAIN JUDGMENT FOR SUCH MONEY    THE STATUTE THUS AUTHORIZES THE PROCEEDING BY MOTION WHENEVER A PER SON IS ENTITLED TO RECOVER MONEY IN ACTION ON ANY CONTRACT THE ONLY RESTRICTION IMPOSED BY THE STATUTE AS TO THE NATURE OF THE CONTRACT UPON WHICH THE RECOVERY MAY BE BY MOTION IS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER MONEY UPON IT BY ACTION IF THE CONTRACT IS SUCH THAT THE

THE ASSIGN MENT THAT THE ASSIGNOR WOULD REPAY THE CONSIDERATION HE HAD RECEIVED FOR THE CHOSE IN ACTION ASSIGNED IF PAYMENT THEREOF BY THE USE OF DUE DILIGENCE COULD NOT BE OBTAINED FROM THE OBLIGOR

THE STATUTE SEC 2861 OF THE CODE PROVIDES THAT ANY ASSIGNEE MAY RECOVER FROM ANY ASSIGNOR OF SUCH WRITING AS IS DESCRIBED IN SEC 2860 BUT THAT A REMOTE ASSIGNOR SHALL HAVE THEBENEFIT OF THE SAME DEFENCE AS IF THE SUIT HAD BEEN INSTITUTED BY HIS IMMEDIATE ASSIGNEE THE EFFECT OF THE STATUTE SEC 2861 IS TO EXTEND TO A REMOTE ASSIGNEE THE BENEFIT OF THE PROMISE IMPLIED BY LAW FROM AN ASSIGNOR TO HIS IMMEDIATE AS SIGNEE AND TO GIVE TO THE REMOTE ASSIGNEE AS WELL AS TO THE IMMEDIATE ASSIGNEE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER UPON SUCH IMPLIED PROMISE THE RIGHT WHICH HE PREVIOUSLY HAD IN EQUITY THE STATUTE

AT BAR IS ON A CONTRACT UPON WHICH THE PLAINTIFF WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER MONEY BY ACTION AND THEREFORE COMES WITHIN THE VERY TERMS OF THE STATUTE AUTHORIZING A RE COVERY BY MOTION IT WAS ALSO ASSIGNED AS ERROR THAT EVEN IF THE COURT HAD THE RIGHT TO GIVE JUDGMENT ON THE MOTION IT DID NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO GIVE SUCH A JUDGMENT AS WAS ENTERED THE ALLEGED GROUND OF THIS OBJECTION IS THAT THE JUDGMENT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE CAUSE OF ACTION SET OUT IN THE NOTICE AND THAT THE ENTRY OF THE JUDGMENT SHOWS THAT THE COURT CONSIDERED THE NOTE AS THE GROUND OF THE MOTION AND NOT THE IMPLIED LIABILITY CREATED BY THE ASSIGNMENT THIS OBJECTION IS MORE APPARENT THAN REAL THE NOTE WAS A NECESSARY PIECE OF EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF THE MOTION IN ORDER TO PROVE THE AS SIGNMENT IT WAS ALSO NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE COURT TO FIX THE MEASURE OF THE RECOVERY FOR IN THE ABSENCE OF PROOF TO THE CONTRARY THE LAW PRESUMES THAT THE ASSIGNOR RECEIVED FOR THE NOTE A SUM EQUAL TO THAT SPECIFIED IN

WOULD HAVE BEEN FOR THE VERY SAME AMOUNT FOR WHICH IT WAS ENTERED 610 DECLONG V PENCE S COMMITTEE IT IS RIGHT IN SUBSTANCE IF NOT TECHNICALLY RIGHT IN FORM THE INFOR MALITY IS A HARMLESS ERROR AND CAN WORK NO POSSIBLE INJURY TO THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR THE INFORMAL ENTRY OF A JUDGMENT IS NOT A GROUND FOR REVERSING IT CODE OF VA SEC 3449 A FURTHER OBJECTION WAS MADE TO THE JUDGMENT IN THAT IT DECLARED IN OBEDIENCE TO THE REQUIREMENT OF THE STATUTE ACTS 188990 P 117 THAT THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WAS WAIVED WAIVER OF THE EXEMPTION PRESCRIBED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND BY CHAP 178 OF THE CODE IS PROVIDED FOR IN SEC 3647 IT READS SO FAR AS IT IS NECESSARY TO NOTICE IT AS FOLLOWS  IF ANY PERSON SHALL DECLARE IN A BOND BILL NOTE OR OTHER INSTRUMENT BY WHICH HE IS OR MAY BE COME LIABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY TO ANOTHER OR BY A WRITING THEREON OR ANNEXED THERETO THAT HE WAIVES AS TO SUCH OBLIGATION THE EXEMPTION FROM LIABILITY OF THE PROPERTY OR ESTATE WHICH HE MAY BE ENTITLED TO CLAIM AND HOLD EXEMPT UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CHAP TER THE SAID PROPERTY OR ESTATE WHETHER PREVIOUSLY SET APART OR NOT SHALL BE LIABLE TO BE SUBJECTED FOR SAID OBLIGATION UNDER LEGAL PROCESS IN LIKE MANNER AND TO THE SAME EXTENT AS OTHER PROPERTY OR ESTATE OF SUCH PERSON    IT THUS APPEARS THAT THE WAIVER IS REQUIRED TO BE IN WRITING AND MUST BE EXPRESSED IN THE BOND BILL NOTE OR OTHER WRITING ITSELF WHICH IS THE EVIDENCE OF THE OBLIGATION OR BY A WRITING THEREON OR ANNEXED THERETO AND WHERE IT IS SO DONE THE EXEMPTION IS DECLARED TO BE WAIVED AS TO THE SAID OBLIGATION THERE WAS SUCH WAIVER IN THE BODY OF THE NOTE REFERRED TO AND IT WAS EXPRESSED TO BE A WAIVER AS TO THE ENDORSERS AS WELL AS TO THE DRAWERS MAKERS OF THE NOTE STRICTLY SPEAKING THE ASSIGNORS WERE NOT ENDORSERS BUT THE WAIVER WOULD PERHAPS BE CONSTRUED TO INCLUDE THEM ACCORDING TO THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES YET IF SO THE WAIVER WAS ONLY AS TO THE PARTICULAR OBLIGATION EXPRESSED IN THE BODY OF THE NOTE AND NOT AS TO THE IMPLIED OBLIGATION GROWING OUT OF THE ASSIGN MENT WHICH IS THE GROUND OF THE MOTION IN THIS CASE THE LATTER IS A WHOLLY DIFFERENT OBLIGATION THE MOTION WAS NOT BASED UPON THE NOTE NEITHER THE NOTE NOR THE OBLIGATION OF WHICH IT IS THE EVIDENCE WAS THE GROUND OF THE MOTION BUT IT WAS AS WE HAVE SEEN THE IMPLIED OBLIGATION CREATED BY THE ASSIGNMENT AS TO THIS IMPLIED OBLIGATION THERE WAS NO WAIVER OF THE EXEMPTION AND THE COURT ERRED IN SO AD JUDGING SUCH ERROR IS HOWEVER NOT A GROUND FOR REVERSING THE JUDGMENT BUT IT MAY BE AMENDED IN THIS RESPECT AND BEING SO AMENDED IT MUST BE AFFIRMED AMENDED AND

MAKER HENCE THE INCORPORATION IN NEGOTIABLE NOTES OF A WAIVER OF EXEMPTION BY THE ENDORSERS AS IS THE CUSTOM IS EFFECTUAL AS TO THEM NOT SO HOWEVER AS TO ASSIGNMENTS OF NONNEGOTIABLE NOTES THE ASSIGNOR IS NOT BOUND BY THE NOTE OR BY HIS ASSIGNMENT OF IT IN THE ABSENCE OF A SPECIAL AGREE MENT TO THAT EFFECT TO PAY IT AS IN THE CASE OF AN ENDORSER OF A NEGOTIABLE NOTE HIS UNDERTAKING IS TO REFUND OR REPAY THE VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION HE HAS RE CEIVED FOR THE ASSIGNMENT IF THE ASSIGNEE BY THE EXERCISE OF DUE DILIGENCE CANNOT RECOVER THE DEBT ASSIGNED THE IMPLIED CONTRACT BETWEEN THE ASSIGNOR AND ASSIGNEE OF A NONNEGOTIABLE NOTE IS DIFFERENT AND QUITE DISTINCT FROM THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE MAKER AND PAYEE OF SUCH NOTE AND HENCE THE WAIVER OF EXEMPTION AS TO THE OBLIGATION OF THE NOTE DOES NOT EMBRACE THE OBLIGATION ARISING OUT OF THE ASSIGNMENT THIS WAS DECIDED BY THE COURT THE SAME RULE WOULD APPLY TO THE ASSIGNMENT OF A BOND OR ANY OTHER NONNEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENT THE DISTINCTION POINTED OUT IS OF MUCH IMPORTANCE IN BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS IF AN ASSIGNEE AS DISTINGUISHED FROM AN ENDORSER DESIRES TO SECURE FROM HIS ASSIGNOR A WAIVER OF EXEMPTION HE MUST PROVIDE FOR IT

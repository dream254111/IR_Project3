condition is the gist of the action for without a breach there is no cause of action But the breach assigned must be of the condition set forth in the bond and if the condition of the bond is to do one thing and the breach assigned is a failure to do another as in the case at bar the declaration is bad on demurrer 2 STATUTORY BONDSUnauthorized conditionsOmissions A bond taken by a court or officer in pursuance of a statute is not vitiated because by mistake an unauthorized condition is inserted in it or some condition prescribed is omitted unless the statute by express words or necessary implication makes it wholly void and the bond may be sued on so far as the conditions are good as a statutory bond LANCASTER AND OTHERS V BARTON  LAMB AND OTHERSDe cided at Richmond February 20 1896Harrison J 1 SALE OF INFANTS LANDSAffidavit to bill An affidavit annexed to a bill filed under section 2616 of the Code sworn to before me in my county aforesaid is sufficient evidence that the bill was sworn to and as the section does not require that the bill shall show that it was verified by the affidavit of the plaintiff the facts may be shown by evidence aliunde though the better practice is for the affidavit to show the fact 2 SALE OF INFANTS LANDSParties Where a father and mother hold lands in trust for their infant children a bill filed in the names of the father and mother in their own right and as trustees for such infants against the infants is a sufficient compliance with the statute sec 2616 of the Code as to parties as it makes parties those who would be the heirs of each one of the infants if he or she were dead 3 COMMISSIONERS REPORTHearing on If a case is referred to a commis sioner merely to take evidence and report upon the propriety of a sale of infants

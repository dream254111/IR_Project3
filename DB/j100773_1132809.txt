CRIMINAL STATISTICS OF THE AMERICAN PRISON ASSOCIATION1 EUGENE SMITH At the International Prison Congress held at Washington last year tlhe foreign delegates while they seemed favorably impressed by most of our institutions were outspoken in condemnation of our county jails and our criminal statistics They could not repress their amazement at the dearth of official statistics regarding crime in the United States Possibly it may be doubted whether any of the novelties they observed here produced on their minds so lasting and injurious an impression of this country regarded from the point of view of scientific penology as that caused by the meagerness and practical inutility of our criminal statistics It must be freely admitted that the English and some of the continental statistics of crime are far in advance of our own in com prehensiveness in method and in scientific value But the inadequacy of the criminal statistics of the United States is largely owing to a condition which does not exist in England or hardly on the Continent We are confronted with difficulties that are practically unknown on the other side of the Atlantic difficulties inherent in the dual system of government existing in this country In the division of sovereignty between the Federal Government and the States the treat ment of crime falls within the jurisdiction of the States Congress it is true acting within the limits closely defined in the Constitution has the power to declare certain acts which are injurious to the nation to be crimes Thus there is a Federal Criminal Code violations of which are within the exclusive jurisdiction of the Federal Courts But these crimes are only those that bear relation to the central government they are comparatively few in number The vast volume of crime in this country comes under the exclusive jurisdiction of the separate States The establishment of police and constabulary forces the detection and arrest of offenders the trial and sentencing of criminals the administration of prisons all are included within the functions of the States The rules and regulations governing the police the courts the prisons all the details of their administration and of their records are thus matters of State jurisdiction And in Read at the convention of the American Prison Association at Omaha October 9I r 877EUGENE SMITH those matters that fall within the jurisdiction of the States the States have absolute sovereignty the Federal Government is as powerless to di rect or in any manner to interfere with the action of the State in the lawful exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction as the State is powerless to obstruct the Federal Government in the exercise of its exclusive juris diction It is only when the action of the State infringes upon the Fed eral Constitution that it becomes subject to any coercion by the central government All that the Federal Census Bureau attempted in the direction of criminal statistics prior to the year 1904 related simply to prisoners in actual confinement in prisons The Federal agents were able to count these prisoners and to distinguish between the male and the female and the white and the colored without any aid from the States but as to every other item regarding the prisoners the United States Census was necessarily nothing but a transcript from the prison records In 1904 the Census for the first time enlarged its scope by gathering statistics relating to persons committed for crime during that calendar year In this new departure the Census Bureau was entirely limited to an examination of the books and records kept in the prisons The extent and the value of any criminal statistics that have been or that can pos sibly be collected by the Federal Government are necessarily measured by the completeness and accuracy of the books and records maintained by State institutions but since these books and records are under the exclusive jurisdiction of the States the Federal authorities have no power to direct or to supervise in any manner the system by which the records shall be kept they have simply the power of inspection and transcription The Constitution empowers the Federal Government to make only a decennial enumeration of the persons within the United States This gives the implied power to restrain the States from preventing or inter fering with such enumeration but it extends no further it certainly confers no power on the central government to direct or compel the States to keep records of their own affairs in any prescribed form or to keep any records at all The contrast therefore between the authority of our Federal Gov ernment and the authority of European nations in compiling criminal statistics is most marked In Europe the sovereign power in each nation can prescribe the uniform system upon which all public records shall be kept the data which they shall embody and the manner in which these data shall be collected and verified and can enforce obedience to its requirements by every official and every institution within the na tional boundaries In the United States on the contrary the central 878REPORT ON CRIMINAL STATISTICS government can gather only data over the collection and verification of which it has no control State records so far as they contain matter available for the com pilation of criminal statistics are now woefully imperfectimperfect in two main particulars First imperfect because they are kept in a care less and perfunctory manner and without pains to verify the accuracy of entries made in them secondly imperfect especially for purposes of comparison between records of different States because they are not constructed upon any comprehensive and uniform plan Furthermore every court every prison the police of every city in every State is a separate institution maintaining its records upon its own individual plan without much serious effort to assimilate its plan to that of other like institutions even within its own State Certain entries are made re garding each person convicted of crime based mainly upon the answer given by the convict himself to questions put to him Is he a native of this country or of foreign birth Doubtless many an immigrant in fear of deportation or under the impression that natives may receive more element treatment falsely declares that he was born in the United States and so he is numbered statistically among the native born What is his age It is of advantage to an offender to be under twentyone years of age that he may enjoy the benefit of that tenderness of spirit which the law exhibits toward minors it is of ad vantage to be under the age of thirty years in the States that have a re formatory to which only those under thirty years of age can be sen tenced unless indeed the offender prefers confinement in a State prison to the strenuous life of the reformatory The inducement is strong to state the age falsely Is he married or single If the offender is living in circumstances that are scandalous because he is unmarried he is apt to find no difficulty in stating that he is married Has he ever been divorced If he has been the temptation is great to avoid embarrassing explanation In these cases and all similar ones statements made by the offender himself have very slight statistical value they come from an interested and untrustworthy witness Every reasonable effort should be made either before the trial or after conviction to gain from sources outside the offender himself all available information regarding his previous career his environment his habits of life and associations and especially to verify all such items as enter into the statistical record Until this is done the classifications of prisoners contained in our crim inal statistics stating how many are adults and how many are minors stating how many are natives and how many foreignborn stating how 879EUGENE SMITH many are married and how many single cannot be received with confi dence in their accuracy Why is it thatthe existing State records relating to crime are kept in a manner so imperfect and perfunctory Perhaps it is a sufficient answer to saybecause they are not subjected to supervision or control by any central authority A few of the States have passed laws requir ing annual returns to be made to the AttorneyGeneral or to the Secretary of State by criminal courts county clerks or prosecuting attorneys show ing the number of convictions for crime during the year together with varying personal details In most of the States no laws even of this inadequate kind have been enacted But these laws have proved so far as they have any statistical value to be practically a dead letter The records of the criminal courts are committed to the clerks of the court now to gain the essential statistical facts regarding persons brought to trial and to transcribe them faithfully in the records demands of the clerks laborious and conscientious work the work actually done will always be performed in a lax and slovenly manner so long as it is not reviewed or supervised by any superior authority It now receives in fact practically no supervision whatever The AttorneyGeneral or Secretary of State simply receives the returns in whatever form they may come to him If any court fails to send in returns or if any court fails to keep any statistical records at all no one is greatly disturbed and no coercive measures are thought of In this deplorable chaotic condition of the very sources from which all statistical matter must be drawn it is hopeless to lookl for any improvement in our Census statistics unless a radical change can be effected in State administration The records of the police the courts the prisons can be made of statistical value only by the action of the state itself and there is apparent but one method by which the State can act to this end There should be estab lished in each State a permanent Board or Bureau of Criminal Statistics whether as an independent body or as a department of the office of the AttorneyGeneral or of the Secretary of State This Bureau should be charged with the duty of prescribing the forms in which the records of all criminal courts police boards and prisons shall be kept and of specifying the items regarding which entries shall be made The law creating the Bureau should direct that the forms prescribed by it should be uniform as to all institutions of the same class to which they respec tively apply and be binding upon all institutions within the State The Bureau should issue general instructions governing the collection and verification of the facts to be stated in the record it should also be its 880REPORT ON CRIMINAL STATISTICS duty and it should be vested with power to inspect and supervise the records and to enforce compliance with its requirements Such a Bureau might secure a collection of reliable statistical matter uniform in qual ity throughout the State Indiana is now I believe the only State in the Union where such a Bureau exists But even this result is not enough Supposing all the criminal rec ords within each separate State were made uniform throughout the State still they would not be available for comparison or for the purposes of a National Census unless all the States could be brought to adopt the same form and method so that all criminal records throughout the Union could be kept upon one uniform plan Here we encounter a serious obstacle The diversity and conflict of State laws are crying evils of our time universally recognized and denounced and yet the most strenuous efforts to bring about harmonious action between the legislatures of sep arate States have always failed No single statute however skilfully drawn proposed for universal acceptance has ever yet been adopted by all the States of the Union Still the States must act in unison upon this matter of uniform criminal records or else our statistics of crime must continue to be a national failure and a national reproach Not the slightest reflection can be cast upon the Federal Census Bureau on the contrary when consideration is taken of the fragmentary and chaotic State records with which the Census Bureau had to deal the systematic and orderly results and the general deductions embraced in the Census Report of 1904 must be regarded as a signal scientific triumph Uniformity in criminal records throughout the Union we have seen to be an imperative need is it a visionary ideal impossible of attain ment If there is any means through which the ideal can be realized it is through the agency of State Bureaus of Criminal Statistics such as have just been suggested Each of these State Bureaus in preparing uniform plans and forms for its own State would naturally place itself in touch with the National Census Bureau while the National Bureau would not be legally vested with the slightest power to dictate to the State Bureau or to direct its action practically its wide experience and grasp of the entire situation would enable the Federal Bureau to wield commanding influence in shaping the action of every State Bureau If the creation of efficient State Bureaus of the kind indicated in the sev eral States could only be secured it is not chimerical to believe that through the dominating influence of the Federal Census Bureau tact fully exerted a uniform system of statistical records relating to crime could ultimately be established throughout the United States It is the first step that costs If a few of the leading States in the Union could 88iEUGENE SMITH be induced to establish such a Bureauif to Indiana could be added New York Illinois Nebraska and in the South Virginiathe force of example would be potent in the sister States Professor MayoSmith in his work on the Science of Statistics states that criminal statistics present the most complicated and difficult problems within the scope of the science Some of the difficulties and elements of uncertainty attending such statistics have been adverted to there are so many unknown and unascertainable factors affecting the prob lems of crime that conclusions drawn from criminal statistics must be received with the utmost caution Statistical variations that seem on their face to point in a certain direction may be really caused by facts pointing in exactly the opposite direction One exceedingly common and popular error needs special mention a marked increase in the number of convictions for crime indicates to the public mind an increase necessarily in the volume of crime commit ted In fact it may be owing to increased activity and efficiency on the part of the police and detective officers to greater severity and thorough ness in the administration of the courts to a change in the economic conditions of the community to diminished care and skill on the part of offenders in escaping detection indeed there are many possible fac tors that may have combined to produce an unusual statistical result A slight change in the laws or methods of procedure may cause start ling statistical fluctuations For example in the year 1890 the number of convictions for drunkenness in Massachusetts was 25582 two years later the number had fallen to 8634 An amazing diminution of drunk enness in Massachusettsnearly 70 per cent Not at all it was owing to a new statute passed in 1891 the effect of which was that only those arrested for the third time within a year were subject to conviction The congestion of population in cities and the progress of invention necessitates every year the enactment of numerous statutes and munici pal ordinances making certain acts that are harmful to the public mis demeanors that is legally crimes but these acts committed in large part through ignorance or negligence are not essentially of a criminal nature Statistically they swell the number of crimes committed but most of them are not crimes in the meaning popular usage attaches to that word These considerations suggest that all attempts to draw conclusions from and to explain the significance of the rise or fall of the statistical barometer must be conducted with extreme caution An error into which speakers and writers upon crime are prone to fall is that of regarding the statistics of crime as a measure of the total 882REPORT ON CRIMINAL STATISTICS volume of crime committed in the country affording an answer to the vital questionIs crime increasing There are two fundamental facts relating to crime that must never be forgotten First that criminal sta tistics are and must necessarily always be confined to those crimes that are known and are officially acted upon by the police or the courts Sec ondly that there is a large number of crimes that are committed secretly and are never divulged the perpetrators of which are never detected and crimes that never result in the apprehension of the offender The crimes of this second class cannot possibly enter into any criminal sta tistics and yet they form a very large part of the total volume of crime committed It does not seem to be commonly appreciated that these un published unpunished crimes which can never be included in any crim inal statistics probably far exceed in number those that are followed by conviction and punishment A striking example of this class of unpublished crimes comes to the memory of the writer of this report connected with a gentle man who was his personal friend At the time of the occurrence to be related this gentleman who may be called James Simpson had retired from business in his old age He was not wealthy but from a long and industrious life had saved sufficient means to enable him to pass his closing years in comfort He received a call one day from the cashier of a bank who stated that he had come to see Mr Simpson about the payment of these notes of his exhibiting a number of promis sory notes signed James Simpson and aggregating in amount some 25000 Mr Simpson who had not before heard of any such notes perceived at a glance that his signature to them had been forged but he was shocked to recognize by the same glance that the notes throughout were in the handwriting of his own sonthe son had forged his fathers signature He was doubtless unable to conceal his agitation for the cashier in alarm asked The signatures are yours arent they The father was immediately confronted with a tragical dilemma If he should adopt the notes as if they were genuine he was at a loss to know how he could pay them he would have to mortgage his property it would subject him to great difficulty and privation perhaps he would have to try to get into business again On the other hand if he should repudiate the notes as forgeries there flashed before his mind visions of a public trial before a criminal court his son the prisoner at the bar the inevitable sentence his only son a State prisoner in prison garb doomed to end his life in disgrace and ruin There was no time for delibera tion the crucial question The signatures are yours arent they  must be met without hesitation or wavering The father promptly answered 883EUGENE SMITH and the same answer would be given probably in ninetyfive cases out of a hundredhe said quietlyYes they are my notes This example recalls another relating to another friend of the writer the narration of which may be excused as the circumstances attending it were peculiarly interesting and strange A merchant in the city of New York had in his employment a bookkeeper who had served him for twenty years and was trusted without limit By sheer accident the employer happened to notice a misentry in the books relating to a trans action of the previous day this false entry made by the bookkeeper meant a loss to the employer of 200 His suspicion aroused the employer made a closer examination of the books and discovered another false entry of the same kind made some two weeks before involving loss to him of another sum of about 200 He then summoned the bookkeeper to his private office and charged him with the theft of these two items amount ing together to some 400 The bookkeeper indignantly protested his innocence but on being confronted with the proofs which were con vincing he broke down completely and confessed that he had been pilfer ing from his employer for a series of years past When asked how much he had taken he replied I can tell you exactly and he drew from hia pocket a neatly written memorandum giving dates and amounts stolen aggregating about 15000 The merchant appalled at this unexpected disclosure exclaimed John what have you done with all this money  John replied With the first 3500 taken I bought a little house and lot in New Jersey where I am living all the rest of the money I put into savings banks in this city where it now is intact and I am ready to make restitution of all of it to you and as soon as the deed can be prepared I will convey to you the house in New Jersey which is worth all I gave for it In verification of his statements he produced the savings banks books showing the deposits in his name and he said I am ready to go with you now to these banks and draw out these moneys and repay them to you Events were moving rapidly but the merchant summoned a carriage and the two men started out to make the round of the savings banks As they entered the carriage the bookkeeper drew from his pocket a roll of bank bills containing several hundred dollars which he handed to his employer saying Here this is part of your moneytake it They visited the savings banks drew out the deposits and when they re turned to the office the merchant had recovered all that had been stolen from him except the New Jersey house and that was duly conveyed to him afterward Now who can tell how many occurrences similar to this are daily happening except as to the feature of restitution in the last case cited 884REPORT ON CRIMINAL STATISTICS that feature was surely unique Crimes of burglary of robbery of black mail of rape of larceny of assault are being constantly committed that never come to the public ear The victims of these crimes endure them in silence impelled by multitudinous motives A merchant may have apprehension that if it becomes known that he has sustained loss through robbery or embezzlement his commercial credit may be seriously im paired other victims shrink from the annoyance and publicity of ap pearing as prosecutors at a criminal trial and reason that even the con viction of the offender cannot in any degree repair the loss or damage they have already suffered others are restrained by distrust of the police or by fear of revenge by the offender or his allies the situation or con duct of the victim himself at the time the crime was committed may have been such as to cast discredit or ridicule upon him if publicly disclosed pity for the guilty person professing penitence or for his innocent fam ily or the fact that the offender was his relative may restrain the victim from conducting a prosecution that would bring disgrace and suffering without any compensating benefit These and countless other like in ducements not to prosecute control the action of the victim in possibly a majority of all the cases where crimes are committed It often re quires public spirit and a strong sense of justice and of public duty to sustain a complainant in pressing a criminal prosecution to final convic tion In addition to these unpublished crimes there are numerous cases where crime is committed and reported to the police but proceed no further In these instances the offender may be known but has escaped or the offender is unknown and eludes detection in either case there is no conviction and the crime remains unpunished All these crimes both those that are unpublished and those that are unpunished cut no figure in the statistics of crime What proportion they bear in number and in mag nitude to those included in statistics cannot possibly be known and yet they constitute a very large part of the total volume of crime Do these unpublished and unpunished offenses bear a constant relation to the crimes of the statistics both increasing or decreasing in like ratio The prosecution and punishment of crime is designed to check its commis sion that is to reduce the number of crimes committed Is it not prob able then that as the number of crimes that are detected and punished increases the number of those crimes that are unpublished and unpun ished will tend to decrease instead of increase That the ratio between the two classes will be not a direct but an inverse ratio There is no possible means of arriving at a positive and confident answer to these questions All that is certain is that any criminal statistics that can 885EUGENE SMITH possibly be gathered must relate to a part only and doubtless a minor part of the whole volume of crime and that there is no possible means of learning whether the magnitude of that known part varies in a direct or in an inverse ratio to that of the rest of the volume Is crime in creasing This is a question vastly interesting and important whether the question relates to the number of crimes committed or the number of criminals it embraces the whole body of crime actually committed in the country To this question criminal statistics cannot be made to yield any answer This conclusion however dispiriting does not impugn the value of statistics of crime There are many problems where such statistics are not only useful but indispensable Statistics are our chief source of knowledge concerning the elements of population that enter into the criminal classes the essential condition of these elements the proportion of prisoners convicted for the different kinds of offenses Annual Re port of 1907 of American Prison Association p 208 Perhaps the highest value of criminal statistics consists in the light they may throw upon the practical effects produced by penal legislation by judicial pro cedure and by the administration of police and detective officers For example within the past decade radical clianges in the administration of justice have been established in this country by laws relating to juve nile offenders and by the extended use of the suspended sentence and probation A question has arisen in many minds whether the severity of the penal law has not thus been unduly relaxed It is a matter of su preme importance to know whether and how far the tenderness of the modern law toward children serves to rescue them from a life of crime to know whether the clemency of the law toward adults by suspension of sentence and probation promotes their rehabilitation and to know to what class of offenders this clemency may properly be extendedto know whether these milder methods of treatment are affording adequate protection to the public or whether sterner measures of restraint and dis cipline may be made more effective in repressing crime These vital questions can receive final answer only by following the subsequent career of tile offenders to whom these methods are applied and thus gaining data for statistical tabulation In the same way the virtue of the inde terminate sentence ought to be substantiated by the statistical test Sta tistics can be made to show what class of crimes comes most frequently be fore thle courts in a given community and whether an increase in the severity of punishment tends to increase or diminish the number of convictions A movement is now in progress which may greatly widen the scope 886REPORT ON CRIMINAL STATISTICS of criminal statistics It has long been realized that many persons sen tenced for crime are feebleminded and seriously defective mentally and physically but within the past few years the conviction has been grow ing that our penal system is radically imperfect in that it provides no adequate means for deciding whether or not a person on trial for crime is really responsible criminally Some two years ago the writer of this report had his attention and interest directed to a convict confined in the State Prison of one of the western States The man was subject to seizures which were diagnosed possibly correctly as of an epileptic nature They were attacks of acute mania when he became violent and was apparently unconscious of his acts as he retained no memory of what had occurred during the attack In one of these seizures he committed a violent assault upon and killed the foreman of the factory where he was a workman He was convicted of murder and sent to the State prison There he was subjected to close medical observation and treatment and last year underwent a surgical operation which resulted in the discovery of a needle in or upon the surface of the brain with a thickening of the adjacent part of the skull The removal of the needle was followed by a quick recovery the general health of the man which had been reduced rapidly improved and there has since been no recurrence of the spas modic seizures Last April he was discharged from the prison upon parole or conditional pardon and his future career will be watched with interest for the appearance of any criminal tendency It cannot be doubt ed that many of the convicts now confined in prison are constitutionally abnormal on the border line between sanity and insanity or mentally defective to such a degree that they are not fit subjects for penal treat ment The protection of the public requires that they should be confined not in prison but in an institution where they can receive medical and psychopathic treatment The stern discipline of the prison may often serve positively to aggravate the infirmities from which they suffer and render them more dangerous to the community on their discharge To meet this necessity it is now demanded that every person tried for crime shall be subjected to a psychological and medical examination by experts to ascertain and report whether his mental or physical condition is so far impaired or so far abnormal as to render him irresponsible criminally Such report would be an invaluable aid to the court in determining whether the offender should be committed to prison for a limited term or to a custodial institution for an indefinite period to be released only when his release will be consistent with safety to the public Examinations of this kind have lately been conducted with re sults interesting and notable in the New Jersey State Reformatory in the 887EUGENE SMITH Reformatory for Women at Bedford New York in the Tombs Prison in New York City and elsewhere they have shown that a large fraction of the number of prisoners examined are mentally defective and below the line of criminal responsibility for their acts The Prison Associa tion of New York has recently organized an active committee compris ing eminent specialists in mental disease to promote the legislative adop tion of a system requiring the medicopsychological examination of all persons placed on trial or imprisoned for crime If the movement in this direction should prove successful the contemplated examinations might furnish a mass of data for the establishment of a new department in the science of criminal statistics There are numberless legal sociological and economic problems bear ing upon the efficiency of the police force and of the administration of justice by the courts on immigration education marriage and divorce commercial prosperity or depression drunkenness and vagrancy lunacy and idiocy unemployment and poverty all in their relation to crime upon which criminal statistics may be made to throw needed light To sum up it is but a truism to say that statistics to be useful for any purpose must be comprehensive accurate and uniform What sta tistics we now have are deficient in all these qualities To secure the ultimate introduction of these lacking qualities into our criminal statis tics must be made the aim of present endeavor The institution in each State of the Union of a Bureau of Criminal Statistics all these Bureaus brought into harmonious and united activity through the cobperation and under the guidance of the Federal Census Bureau is urged as the most effective means to this end To stimulate interest and effort toward the establishment of such State Bureaus is presented as the chief burden of this report 888

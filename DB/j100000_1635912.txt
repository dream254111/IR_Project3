from Nature that the Duke of Connaught on November 5 laid the founda tionstone of the new university hall of the Cape University The council of the univer sity presented an address in which the hope was expressed that the union now accom plished in South Africa would lead to the con version of the present Cape University into a teaching university for the whole of South Africa by incorporating existing institutions of higher education as constituent colleges and by creating chairs for those subjects for which no single college could provide In re plying the Duke of Connaught said he trusted that the funds necessary to convert the Cape University into a great teaching university would be forthcoming At a university luncheon held on the same day Mr Malan minister of education announced that Mr Otto Beit had agreed to divert the sum of 200000 bequeathed by the late Mr Alfred Belit for the foundation of a university at Johannesburg to the creation of a great teach ing university at

Rodman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has been appointed adjunct professor of electrical engineering DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE THE REFORM OF THE CALENDAR TO THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE The several sug gestions for the simplification of the current calendar made in your columns by Reining haus July 29 Slocum embracing those of Cotsworth September 2 Patterson October 14 and Dabney October 21 awaken the hope that a calendar can be contrived which will be much superior to the present one and which at the same time will not encounter so much prejudice and human inertia as to be fatal to its adoption at an early date It is however of the first importance that the new calendar be so well matured before its adoption is seri ously urged that it will not itself need to be laid aside for something better by the time it has fairly come into use To this end sugges tions from various points of view followed by a period of deliberate study and tentative combination may well be regarded as indis pensable to the best ultimate results As a possible contribution to this preliminary work I venture to suggest a calendar that embodies many of the excellent suggestions already made but instead of introducing a 13th month makes use of only 12 months of 4 weeks 28 days each bunching these into four groups and placing the remaining four weeks between these groups so as to set out the four seasonal quarters of the year distinctly The purpose is to facilitate the use of the quarters of the year as convenient time divi sions of an order intermediate between the month and the year The quarters of the year already have a large place in the accountings of the industrial and financial world and are likely to grow into very important time divi sions The integers of the proposed scheme are these a Quarters Corresponding measurably to the four seasons SCIENOE 757

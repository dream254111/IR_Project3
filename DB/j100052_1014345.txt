HARRY R TOSDAL Harvard University Graduate School of Business Administration AMONG significant influences of the war is an increased respect for organization as a means of accom plishing desired ends in civil life as well as in military operation It was recognized in a conflict in which there was call for the entire energy and re sources of nations that economic coop eration was as necessary as military organization and continuous co6pera tion was only to be assured by more or less formal organization In some cases the necessary organization of industry was accomplished by direct government control in other cases by private organizations directed in vary ing measure by public authority It was logical that as thoughts of a post war period began to assume impor tance in the minds occupied by war activity organization should be re garded as the first step for the recovery and development of national as well as international production and distribu tion Although action was sporadic in the early years of the war and in form the organization varied in differ ent industrial countries the end of the war saw a much greater similarity in organization methods and in ideas and opinions of nations concerning indus trial combination than had existed before 1914 The greatest change in opinion appears in England and in the United States which were the most prominent industrial countries characterized by the English common law attitude of opposition to certain types of combina tions which involved restraint of trade English government committees and authorities adopted a position of encouragement of trade and industrial organizations as a means of rehabili tating commerce and industry The United States departed from its tra ditional attitude in passing the Webb Law legalizing export combinations The prewar contrasts with Germany in this respect have largely disappeared The development of trade and in dustrial organization during and fol lowing the war in so far as it affects foreign trade may be broadly classified into government organizations on the one hand and private and semipublic organizations on the other Govern ment organization for foreign trade shows the greatest development in England where the Board of Trade and the Foreign Office jointly formed the Department of Overseas Trade which combined a variety of promo tional activities formerly decentralized The general divisionsEmpire Trades and Economic Division Foreign Divi sion Exhibitions and Fairs Division Export Credits Departmentindicate roughly the broad scope of its work Chiefly through the collection and dis semination of commercial intelligence concerning trade conditions and oppor tunities the Department aims to develop British foreign trade GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION FOR FOREIGN TRADE In Germany foreign trade matters were before the war handled in part by the Ministry of the Interior and in part by the Foreign Affairs Office Efforts to bring about the establish ment of a ministry dealing specifically with foreign trade were unsuccessful 100FOREIGN TRADE ORGANIZATION The government recognized however that the Ministry of the Interior com bined too many functions conse quently there was formed a new de partment called the Imperial Economic Office The jurisdiction of this de partment in matters of commerce embraces questions of commercial pol icy and commercial treaties war economic measures including retal iation economic aspects of tariff and taxation insurance corporations banks stock exchanges exhibitions and matters concerning conditions of production at home and abroad gen eral statistics as well as statistics of trade with foreign countries In France the change in govern mental organization has been one in activity rather than in form The French Office National du Commerce Exterieur was intended to aid French exporters and importers by means of commercial intelligence service and otherwise but prior to the war little could be done because of inadequate support Renewed interest in exports is responsible for increased appropria tions and the correspondingly increased scope of its activities Steps have been taken likewise by the Italian Ministry of Commerce to strengthen the central organization in order to establish contact between the Depart mlent of Commercial Intelligence and industrial concerns A Committee of Conmmercial Intelligence has been formed the purpose being to coordinate commercial intelligence and the activ ities of the government with those institutes of similar purpose the com mercial attaches and the chambers of commerce abroad Supplementing these organizations are the semiofficial commercial organ izations of the chamber of commerce type Great Britain has encouraged the establishment of chambers of com merce in foreign countries and since the war has brought it about that most of these are purely British and working for British interests In France reorganization of the domestic chambers of commerce according to the regional system has been carried out in the interests of greater efficiency Individual chambers such as the Paris and the Lyon organizations have been active in promoting foreign trade The presidents of the various cham bers with representatives chosen on the basis of one to each ten thousand members form a central organization Various chambers of commerce in Germany have taken an active interest in foreign trade In all these countries federations of chambers of commerce provide the means for greater uni formity of policy Fairs and perma nent exhibitions of national products in foreign markets are maintained by German French and English bodies PRIVATE AND SEMIPUBLIC ORGANIZATIONS The private and semipublic organ izations dealing directly or indirectly with foreign trade present a multi plicity of forms Some of them are organized upon a territorial basis for others purpose is the organization basis Many combinations deal with the interests of members of the particu lar industry or branch of industry Distinction may be made between associations of the federation type embracing numerous industries and associations embracing individual in dustries or branches of an industry A third group includes associations formed to promote commercial rela tions with individual foreign countries Another class includes export trade associations and the fifth group associations formed for general pur poses which have a bearing upon foreign trade The last but not least important group comprises the various 101THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY industrial combinations consolida tions trade associations cartells syn dicates and the like Federations having large member ship of firms and associations in various industries were created in England Germany France and other European countries during and after the war The Federation of British Industries a trade organization comprising some twenty thousand British manufactur ing and producing firms has taken an active part in the development of foreign trade interests of Great Britain both by constructive criticism of governmental action and by establish ing on its own initiative representa tion through trade commissions in various parts of the world by con ducting an information and advisory service for those engaged in export and import and by taking an active part in the establishment of fairs and exhibi tions GERMAN ASSOCIATIONS The German federation called the Reichsverband der Deutschen Industrie is a consolidation of the two most powerful German industrial associa tions namely the Zentral Verband der Deutschen Industriellen and the Bund der Industriellen Together these rep resented nearly three hundred asso ciations the latter alone represented thirtyfive thousand firms through either its own membership or that of affiliated associations For two decades after its formation in 1876 the Zentralverband was spokes man of German manufacturing indus tries and has at all times been dis tinctly more protectionistic than the Bund der Industriellen it has issued directories of export manufacturers and has encouraged participation in foreign expositions War conditions brought the two associations into much closer contact than had existed pre viously Nevertheless it was impos sible to bring about complete con solidation until after the Armistice Meetings were held in the spring of 1919 and organization was agreed upon As finally formed the Reichsverband was to be governed ultimately by the members but the chief work was to be done by the executive committee for which the claim was made that it included a just uniform and carefully considered representation of individual industrial interests and of individual industrial sections of Germany Upon this committee one hundred and forty members represent the various indus trial associations thirty members rep resent territorial associations There are ten representatives of the individual enterprises ten more chosen by the other members of the committee The business management of the Imperial Association consists of not less than thirty nor more than sixty persons Among the special committees ap pointed are several which indicate the scope of its activity namely the committee on carrying out the eco nomic provisions of the peace treaty the committee on taxation and the committee on economic policy The Imperial Association is working hand in hand with the newly created Impe rial Economic Office and with the Department of Foreign Affairs in the development of foreign trade relations FRENCH ASSOCIATIONS There are two French federations The most important is LAssociation National dExpansion Economique formed December 15 1915 under the auspices of the Paris Chamber of Com merce and comprising the important manufacturers trade associations in surance banking shipping and railway interests According to official state ment 102FOREIGN TRADE ORGANIZATION LAssociation National dExpansion Economique is an organization for inquiry and action which will gather together with out prejudice to their autonomy those persons and associations belonging to or interested in commerce industry and agriculture to unite their efforts and coordinate their work   It will assure common action in the national interest To this end it will on the one hand make inquiries in France and abroad and on the other it will stimulate either directly or by encouragement the creation of all institutions organizations or en tentes tending to facilitate the fabrication transport or sale of French products It will call forth the establishment of new industries in France and the opening of new foreign markets Plans have been made to publish yearly an index of French production which is intended to give a survey of the industries of France and of particu lar firms Another association of the federation type formed in the fall of 1919 is La Federation Genrale de la Production Frangaise The purpose of the latter syndicate is to increase French production and consequently export power Among other countries in which the general federation idea has been adopted are Sweden which has the Swedish Export Industries Central Council and Finland with the Finnish Export Association The important European countries furnish numerous examples of general associations intended to promote the interests of the members of a particu lar industry or trade The chemical industries of France Germany and England furnish examples others are Verein der Eisen und Stahl Industriellen in Germany the associations of ma chinery manufacturers and the associa tions in textile and leather trades in Germany and England Of slightly different character are the associations of manufacturers in particular prov inces and districts Such bodies do not attempt to influence terms of sale or selling methods Many of them are keenly interested in foreign trade de velopment but they differ widely in scope and effectiveness their work frequently includes representation of membership in tariff and commercial treaty matters collection of statistics and publications in convenient form Before the war Germany possessed a number of bodies created to promote commercial relations between Ger many and individual foreign countries The GermanFrench Society German Russian Society and the German Argentinian Central Association are examples In the main these associa tions have continued to exist either in their original form or modified by consolidation for more effective effort such as the union of the Argentine and Brazilian societies into a general Ger manSouth American Group The federation of these societies formed early in 1919 under the leadership of the chairman of the GermanArgen tinian Association aims to keep these bodies in touch with each other how ever it will act only when the matter is of general interest and goes beyond the scope of an individual society For somewhat different purposes was formed the GermanBritish Economic Union for protecting Germans in business relations with Great Britain the Colonies Dominions and Protec torates For the trade and industry of Ger many its associations for maintaining and increasing the German spirit among German subjects residing abroad are also of great importance There exist several associations of this sort some of them of an educational character for the study of foreign lands others for the maintenance of the connections between German subjects in different parts of the world The place of these associations in Great 103THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Britain is occupied chiefly by the Brit ish chambers of commerce in foreign countries and their affiliation with the domestic chamber of commerce system Nevertheless the AngloDanubian Association formed recently for the purpose of promoting trade between the newer AustroHungarian secession states and Great Britain indicates that need for such organization has been felt Associations dealing mainly with foreign trade interests show little change since the prewar period first those formed to handle particular aspects of commercial relations with foreign countries or to undertake general propaganda have continued their existence Germany furnishes the best examples of this type in the Deutsch Weltwirtschaftlichegesellschaft the Association of German Import Trade and the Commercial Treaty Association Associations of German exporters such as the Vereinigung der Exportfirmen Berlin including the prominent export merchants of Berlin similar Hamburg and other groups have recently been federated in the Union of German Exporters British exporters are attempting to secure relationship with various parts of the Empire by the development of such associations as the Canadian Association of British Manufacturers and Their Representatives Member ship in these associations is confined to British subjects such as British man ufacturers and wholesale exporters from the United Kingdom and their representatives French export merchants and repre sentatives have also organized in the Syndical Chamber of Agents for Ex port Trade The National Privy Council for Export Trade the Cham ber of Commerce for Export Trade the Norman Committee of Encourage ment for the Formation of French Agents Abroad may be mentioned in passing PROMOTION OF FOREIGN TRADE BY INDUSTRIAL COMBINATIONS Industrial combinations along famil iar linespools cartells trusts comp toirs consolidationsare usually or ganized primarily for domestic trade but in the majority of cases they have a keen interest in export trade while in some cases they have been organized exclusively for development of foreign business The general lines of development are much the same as in the prewar period but as a result of the war there has been a distinct increase in the number and impor tance of such combinations and their activities in foreign trade matters The English Committee on Trusts which reported in 1919 regarded the group of associations in which a larger part of the manufacturers or operators of a certain branch combined for pur poses of regulating sales as much more significant than the numerous loose agreements Associations regulating output are differentiated from pools both of these are in turn to be distin guished from the more advanced organizations or consolidations called combines in England and syndicates or cartells in Germany and France As in America the merger or con solidation in England has proceeded more rapidly because of the doubtful legal status of looser arrangements The comparative freedom of German business men in the prewar period to combine as they wished postponed to some extent the resort to merger or consolidation types but even prior to the war the tendency in direction of consolidation is to be clearly perceived In all of these countries there is a dis tinct movement toward integration of industry The selling syndicate in which a 104FOREIGN TRADE ORGANIZATION group of manufacturers contract to sell their output exclusively through the central sales office of the organiza tion presents the highest development of the combination short of merger or consolidation These syndicates es tablish agencies in various countries to get foreign business for instance the French Comptoir for Exportation of Metallurgical Products has branches in Brazil Argentina and China The German coal iron and steel syndicates of the prewar period likewise main tained foreign branches for the sale of their products They also gave export bounties to those domestic manufactur ing consumers of their products who were engaged in export At the present time the raw mate rial situation in France and Germany compels the attention of industrial or ganizations generally In both coun tries efforts have been made with government assistance to centralize the purchases of essential materials either through syndicates or otherwise to prevent losses which might be suffered through competitive purchase Sell ing organizations have generally had to accord a great deal of consideration to prices due to depreciated currency and adverse exchanges The Wire Export Company Ltd in Germany the Shoe and Leather Export Associa tion in England are typical of the com binations formed to handle exclusively the foreign business of members The RhenishWestphalian Coal Syn dicate the most powerful of the Ger man prewar syndicates expired by limitation during the war and was extended only by pressure of govern ment authority Prices and deliveries of coal under present conditions in Germany are more than ever a matter of intense national interest undoubt edly the reason for the compulsory organization of the Coal Economic Union formed after the war for facil itating governmental regulation of the coal industry in the transition period This of course detracts from the power and influence of the coal syndicate In the iron and steel industry the most powerful syndicate was the Steel Works Union formed originally in 1904 and renewed from time to time At the last renewal in 1912 consid erable difficulty was experienced be cause of the conflict of interests be tween integrated and nonintegrated member firms and the organization emerged with considerably less power than before During the war the syndicate was extended from time to time under pressure of the government and its scope was extended to include sales of bar iron for which syndication had long been attempted The syndi cate was renewed provisionally on several occasions after the war but was finally dissolved in May 1920 Its place was taken in part by the Iron Economic Association the nature of which was similar to that of the Coal Economic Association and in part by a general organization of the steel trade called the Stahlbund In France there has been formed since the war the Comptoir Siderur gique which includes all the French steel works and takes an active part in iron and steel exportation In many directions its powers are less limited than those of its German counterpart According to its articles it need not confine itself to purchase and sales of various kinds of iron articles It is also empowered to undertake exploita tion of the industry and purchase of coal iron ore and raw materials The new combination embraces older com binations which individually dealt with halffinished products rails beams and sheets One of the mem bers of the de Wendel concern was a member of the German combination at the time when AlsaceLorraine was 105THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY considered German territory Bel gium has likewise recently formed a Steel Works Union of the German type Limitation of space forbids more than mention of the combinations in textile machinery ceramic leather and other trades The war seems to have given the development of merger and consolida tion a marked impetus although no new types have developed Resistance to amalgamation because it involved loss of autonomy and frequently loss of identity has apparently been much decreased The control of metal mar kets formerly in German possession through the MetallGesellschaft is to be contested by the Societ des Metaux in France and the British Metals Corporation The Amalgamated In dustrials organized in the United Kingdom in 1919 is a prominent ex ample of the holding corporation form of organization controlling shipping iron and coal and cotton companies Chemical manufacturers of France have amalgamated The British have formed the British Dyestuffs Corpora tion in order to meet the competition of the highly organized German dye stuffs industry The explosives branch is controlled by powerful mergers both in England and in Germany Merger and consolidation frequently with intent to increase degree of integration have shown unremitting progress in the coal iron metal finishing and engineering trades in important pro ducing countries Under the leader ship of powerful German industrial leaders notably Hugo Stinnes August Thyssen and the Stumms the vertical combination based on longterm con tracts mergers and fusions has be come the most significant type in the German heavy industries Glass tools textiles are other lines in which we find prominent fusions in two or more of the industrially important European countries International cartells have generally succumbed to the war The proposal to revive the international rail agree ment between England Germany France and the United States for division of foreign trade has not been received with favor in Germany and France The international plate glass cartell one of the most closely organ ized international cartells has likewise fallen to pieces with no immediate prospect of renewal CONCLUSION It is as yet too early to judge as to the effectiveness of the various types of organization in reestablishing foreign trade and a fair appraisal can not be made without consideration of the progress of banking and shipping organization There can be no doubt that organizations of merchants and traders are much more active and are receiving much more support in all progressive countries than before the war To the student of industrial combination it seems that the war brought changes in emphasis looser organizations being displaced by stricter and more comprehensive forms No distinctly new form has been developed but in the future the sim ilarity of development in different countries should render it possible to make broad and thorough comparisons of all types 106

explanation of Amslers instrument in kinemaical language According to my experience kinematical intuitions should be freely used in elementary courses on Calculus  I o Flu 1 OA AB fig I are rods of lengths a and b They are hinged at A and O is fixed We suppose that B describes a circuit and that the rods osoil late back to their old position And we assume that the area X is known to be I pv dt where pv is the moment of the velocity about 0 The velocity of B is made up of a0 perpendicular to OA b4  OB The moments about 0 of these are aeab cos  and b6a cos k b The sum of these is the resultant moment Hence J  a26  b20  abO  bcos o Henice the area is x 2 6a 2624 ab6  4cos  dt 2122 MORLEY or since the change of e and of 4 is 0 1 F  Xj abj Ocos  dt or since 0b  jabJ 20cos  dt  abj cos  dt Now a wheel placed on AB at a distance c from A has perpendicular to AB a velocity aO cos  and therefore the record of the wheel is Jad cos k  c dt or ae os  dt Hence the area described is b x record of the wheel 2 The Ourves In a second mode of explanation indicated in Wil liamsons Integral Calculus and suggested by Sir Robert Ball use is made of the curves for which the wheel slides without rolling On exam ing these curves I find some fiaets which appear worth mentioning I suppose the wheel now to be at the point B and the curves are those described when the velocity of B across AB is zero or ad cos   b4b  0 These curves are the  orthogonal trajectories of the curves for which B moves at right angles to AB that is of the ring of circles of radius b whose centres lie on a circle of radius a Thus as a geometric definition our curves are the orthogonal curves of a ring of circles Or in analogy with the orthogonal trajectory of a rowv of equal circles we can call such a curve the tractrix of a circle If we invert the ring of circles as to its centre 0 we have again a ring ofTHE XOROLLING  CURVES OF AMSLERS PLANIMETER 23 circles and the old orthogonal curves pass into the new orthogonal curves Thus the inverse of a tractrix as to 0 is again a tractrix In the case when b  a the ring of circles inverts into the tangents of a circle and the orthogonal curve of the tangents is the involute of the circle Thus this special tractrix is the inverse of the involute of a circle a8 to the centre of the circle 3 Stereographic projection of the curves To generalize the last remark consider the two concentric circles which touch till the circles of the ring Their radii are rX a  b r  I ab I  Invert the plane into a sphere of diameter Virrl touching the plane at the origin 0 The two con centric circles thus become equal and parallel circles of the sphere of radius V i r Call these latitude circles The ring becomes a system of circles on r  r1 the sphere touching the latitude circles When b  a this system is a ring of small circles whose planes all touch a right cylinder through the latitude cir cles and no ground is gained But when b a the system is a ring of great circles whose planes all touch a right cone through the latitude circles   0 4a W  ab FIG 2 Take then the case b  a The tractrix in the plane maps into the orthogonal curve of the tangent planes of a right cone that is into the spherical involute24 MORLEY qf a latitude circle or curve traced by a point of a circle whose centre is fixed which rolls on a plane I  a Fxo 8 Since each point of the rolling circle is moving at light angles to its plane the curve on the sphere is a curve of conetant dlope that is the tangent makes always a constant angle with a given line 4 byway   b a FIG 4 4 The form of the tractrix of a circle The three cases b  a 1  a b  a are illustrated in the figures In 2 there is an asymptotic circle ofTHE  NOROLLING CURVES OF AMSLER5 PLANIMETER 25 radius V a2  6 In 3 the asymptotic circle reduces to a point In 4 the case of most interest we have equidistant cusps arranged along the circles b  a The angular distance from cusp to cusp is determined at once from the stereo graphic projection 3 For the great circle whose perimeter is 7r Vb2  a2  rolls on the latitude circles whose radius is b2  a22b Hence from one cusp to the next the angle is 7rbIV 2 b a2 and the curve is closed when bV b6  as is a rational number 5 The evolute The instantaneous centre of the motion is I the intersection with OA of the perpendicular to AB through B The centrode in the moving plane is the line BI The motion is the rolling of this line on the fixed centrode which is therefore the evolute of our curve For the evo lute or locus of I we have fig 1  radius vector r  OI c  b see perpendicular on tangent p b  a cos  and therefore r  a p b  ab or ar  bp  1 Also arc s  BI b tan Or If now this evolute rolls on the line IB which is fixed the curve itself will always pass through B the point A will be fixed and 0 will describe a circle whose centre is A That is the problem of finding a curve which when rolled on a line has as roulette a circle is solved by taking for the curve the evolute of the tractrix of a circle and for the tracing point the centre of that circle That this is in fact the only solution is seen at once from the formula curvature of roulette  Dp pr  6 The Newtonian Catenary As the evolute of the ordinary or right tractrix is the catenary it is natural to ask under what force tending to o or from 0 will a string assume the form of the evolute of the tractrix of a circle From the equations tension Tx 1p force F x DrT we have in our case Fit oDf t  arvrs 1squar Thus the requisite law is that of the inverse square26 MORLEY Naturally for attraction that part of the evolute must be taken which is convex to 0 for repulsion the concave part and there can be no inflexions at a finite distance The determination of the particular catenary when the length of the string and the terminals are given requires a closer study of the curve We have 5 r ab sece 1 p b  a cos  2 8b tan  3 and rD8 9 cos  in any curve so that here dO b6 6d b a cos 2b 020 tan

the point B is at its maximum distance from 0 for thecase when in the initial position the rods are doubled up we change the sign of a Whether the curves so obtained are to be re garded as distinct or as parts of one and the same curve is to some extent a matter of taste but I take the latter view which avoids distinguishing the cases when X is rational irrational and imaginaryTHE  NOROLLING  CURVES Of AMSLERS PLANIMETER 27 The equations 4 and 5 serve to determine the position of the apse line and the values of a and b when the terminals the length of string and in the case of repulsion the number of times the curve is to enclose the centre are given For given terminals and length of string we have in general two solutions one for repulsion and one for attraction The relation of these is one of con siderable intricacy But in the special case when the terminals are equidistant from the centre the apse line is the same in both curves Hence from 5 where s r 6 are given and s is less than r the two values of X are the same Hence we may put a pa blub But from 1 and 3  2arb2 a2  82 and r22alr  b1  a12  82 or 72 2Mar 2 a2  Therefore A  1 r2s2a  2 b a2 or r2 s ba Iba  product of

curve of the form 2 and give a fair idea of the whole class Fig 7 is the curve a circular quartic28 MORLEY 1 for which X  2 the general case can be grasped from this by adding more loops round the centre and by rotating the whole about the centre through FIG 6 FIG 7THE tt NOROLLING  CURVES OF AMBLER5 PLANIMETER 29 equal angles Fig 6 is an interesting special case for which a  b X  0 The equations of  6 take the form 2ar 1 A   tan 2 s r19 Thus the length of a symmetric arc of the curve is equal to that of the inter cepted arc of a concentric circle as shown in the figure The parallel with the ordinary catenary may be developed for instance if we ask what is the least length which can rest over two pins equidis tant from 0 with free ends under an attraction it will appear that the curve must be of the form 6 and the least length is 2r1  929 where r is the distance of a pin from the centre and 28 is the angle supposed  2 which the pins subtend at the centre This we may leave as an exercise The equation 2ar 16 is obtainable from the theorem at the end of  6 for if the curve of repulsion be a circle of radius r thenr c  r   whence the theorem gives crr sr0 or r1 62c 8 Kinematies of the bicycle The figures of this paper have been in part drawn by students of the college and one of them Mr Redfield made the interesting remark that the tractrix gives a good idea of the track of the rear wheel of a bicycle when the track of the front wheel is a circle fig 2 For small deviations of the rear wheel from the vertical the variation of the wheel base is in fact very small however great the inclination of the wheels in the usual type of machine in which the steering post points in the normal position near the point of contact of the front wheel with the ground To examine the relative curve of the bicycle tracks when the rear wheel is held vertical call p and p the distances from the axles to the steering head q the distance between p and Pl Let 6 be the inclination of p to the hori zontal 0 the angle turned through by pi a the radius of either wheel the wheels are supposed equal as in the American type of machine Then the coordinates of the point of contact of the front wheel referred to axes through that of the rear wheel such that z is vertical and x the line of symmetry are30 MORLEY X Jv Cos 9  q sin 9 pl Cos Cos 0  a Sill 9 COS 9 sin2 4 V 1

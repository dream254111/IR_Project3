size and strength to which the general name of  storms is given Their most constant features are a more or less pronounced inward spiral whirling of the air near the ground feeding an updraught at the centre and an outflow above  and a progressive motion from place to place along a tolerably welldefined track Clouds and generally rain as well accompany the larger storms It is our object to explain how these disturb ances arise to examine the causes and methods of their peculiar action and to study their dis tribution in time and place With this end in view the small dustwhirlwinds that commonly arise in the hot dry air of deserts will be first considered Next will come the great hurri canes and typhoons of the tropical seas and the less violent rotary storms of our own lati tudes all of which may be grouped together as cyclones The tornadoes and waterspouts showing a peculiar concentration of power over a very limited area will be discussed last The dry whirlwinds in flat desert regions suddenly interrupt the calmness of the air and begin turning catching up dust and sand and carrying them upwards through the spiral vortex to a height of many hundred feet They are therefore not at all like those whirls formed about our streetcorners at the meeting of opposing currents of blustering wind or the eddies of greater strength seen in windy moun tain regions for they arise in a time of quiet and begin their motion without apparent cause Hence we must at the outset inquire into the 1 Based on a series of lectures delivered at the Lowell insti tute Boston in January 1883 NOVEMBER 2 1883590 SCIENCE condition of the atmosphere when it lies at rest examining it especially with regard to the kind of equilibrium that then exists and the changes necessary to produce a tendency to motion When the air is at rest it is normally densest and warmest next to the earths surface and becomes thinner and cooler at successive alti tudes above it It is denser below because the earths attraction pulls it down and com presses the lower layers by the weight of the upper ones It is warmer below mainly be cause the air gets nearly all of its heat by contact with or radiation from the warm earth and not directly from the suns rays which pass through it with but little obstruction The average rate of upward cooling determined by many observations on mountains and in bal loons is about one degree F for every three hundred feet of ascent In this restful con dition let us take a block of the dry air the effect of the presence of watervapor will be considered with the storms at sea from the earths surface where the temperature is say 60 fig 1 and lift it up three hundred feet to where the temperature is   one degree less or 59 The 5Q 59jjj block of lower air expands as it rises because it is pressed  on by less atmospheric 500 FEET weight less at least by the weight of three hundred feet of air and in thus ex Ii panding it is cooled mechan 60 ically It has been shown FIG 1 that this mechanical cooling of an ascending mass of dry air amounts to one degree F in a hundred and eightythree feet of ascent whatever its initial temperature so that in this special case the block is cooled by 16 and its tem perature is reduced to 584 Now let us compare it when thus expanded and cooled with an equalsized block of air beside it whose temperature is 59 Evidently of these two blocks of the same volume and at the same pressure the cooler will be the heavier The block brought up from the surface and now at a temperature of 584 will weigh more than the air at 59 beside it and hence it will tend to sink and it must sink all the way down to its original level before it finds any air as heavy as itself In this imaginary experiment we have disturbed the arrangement of the nor mal quiet atmosphere and the disturbed mass returns to its original position as soon as freed from the constraining force Such an atmos phere is therefore in a condition of stable equi librium like a rod hung by its upper end which VOL 1 No 39 is opposed to any change in its position and when displaced tends to return to its original attitule Evidently when a whirlwind springs up in the calm air of a desert as is so often the case the atmosphere cannot possess this normal sta bility for then there would be no temptation to any such disturbance the air would prefer to stand as it is Before the whirlwind can arise there must have been a change to a condition of unstable equilibrium in which the air like a rod balanced on its lower end is ready to move on small provocation and we have now to look for the cause of this change To be guided properly in the search the conditions necessary and antecedent to the formation of the whirls must be examined They are that the whirls occur generally in level barren warm regions in quiet air and only in the day time after the sun has risen high enough to warm the sandy ground and the air next to it to a rather high temperature As the first and second of these conditions may be present at night as well as by day it must without doubt be the heat from the sun that disturbs the quiet equilibrium into which the air tends to settle and by warming the lower layers causes a departure from the ordinary stable condition of rest Let a case be supposed the sun has warmed the lower air of the first example to a tempera ture of 90 fig 2 while the air three hundred feet above the desert sands  has in virtue of its diather mance risen only to 70 so J884 70 that there is now a difference 1  I of twenty degrees between these two layers If we here 3oo rEr repeat the experiment of car rying a block of surfaceair to a height of three hundred feet it is again mechanically 90 cooled 16 so that its tem Fio 2 perature is reduced to 884 and now comparing it with an equal volume of adjoining air at 70 the latter is evidently the heavier and therefore the block of air brought up from the surface instead of tending to sink as in the first case tends strongly to rise farther and continue the motion given to it In other words the air is now in a condition of unstable equi librium it is ready to upset and rearrange itself The lower layer may be compared to a film of oil balanced beneath a quiet sheet of water a little disturbance would cause the two liquids to change places and the oil would rise through the water draining itself upwardsNOVE MBER 2 1883 SCIE In such a condition as this the desertwhirls may begin It is clearly not necessary in order to produce this resuht that the vertical decrease of temperature should be as much as twenty degrees in three hundred feet as in the case just assumed In order to pass from the stable equilibrium through the indifferent to the unstable equilibrium it is sufficient in dry air that the vertical decrease should be greater than 16 in three hundred feet or greater than one degree in one hundred and eightythree feet Moreover it is important to notice that ac cording to this theoretical explanation the condition of indifferent equilibrium is passed before the surfaceair is as Franklin 1753 and Belt 1859 have said specifically lighter than that above it This would require a tem perature difference of at least 56 F in three hundred feet It is sufficient that the surface air shall be potentially lighter though ab solutely before any motion takes place heavier than the higher layers as Reye first showed 1864 or in other words stable equilibrium is lost and indifferent equilibrium reached when the surfaceair is just enough warmer than any layer above it to make up for the change of temperatures produced in equal izing their densities Any further excess of surfacewarmth brings about theoretic unstable equilibrium On the other hand whirlwinds of decided activity will not be formed until the difference of temperature is much in excess of the narrow limits just given the strength of the upcurrent increasing with its excess of warmth Motion of the atmosphere caused by small dif ferences of temperature would be very gentle and would be perceived only in the boiling of the air often seen in summertime over the brow of a hill It must be then the suns heat as was sup posed that destroys the normal stable equilibri um of our atmosphere and to a disturbance of this kind we can refer more or less directly all storms and indeed all winds that blow about the earth Without the heat that is constantly showered down on us we should soon gravi tate into a lifeless condition of stable equilib rium chemical organic and physical and there remain in endless death But the sun allows no such inactivity on its attendant planets it keeps them alive and at work To be continued THE FRENCH ECLIPSE EXPEDITION P J JANSSEN the leader of the French expedition which visited Caroline Island to observe the solar eclipse of May 6 has made a report to the French NCE 591 academy of sciences which is published in full in the Bulletin hebdomadaire de lAssociation scientifique no 181 It contains first an interesting account of the voyage to Caroline Island and a brief descrip tion of the island with the difficulties encountered in landing the instruments then follows a statement of the instrumental outfit and the plan of observations The search for intramercurial planets was assigned to Messrs Palisa and Trouvelot The former used an equatorial of 016 m aperture having a short focus and large field the latter was provided with an equa torial of the same size which had a finder of 008 m aperture thus giving the observer two telescopes The finder had a field of 45 and was used in exam ining the region in the vicinity of the sun while the larger instrument was intended to give the position of any strange object that might be noted by means of its positioncircles In order to avoid the neces sity of reading the circles an attachment was made to both right ascension and declination circles by which fine marks could be made upon the circles and verniers by the observers assistants and the corre sponding readings determined at leisure The finder was also furnished with a reticule containing cross threads and a positioncircle for use in noting the appearance of the corona to the drawing of which Mr Trouvelot gave a portion of the time of the total phase The search for intramercurial planets was also con ducted by the aid of photographic apparatus which Mr Janssen thus describes   At my order Mr Gautier had prepared an equa torial mounting with an houraxis two metres long carrying a strong and large platform upon which were fastened the following photographic apparatus a large camera having a lens of eight inches 021 m made by Darlot giving a field of 20 to 25 plate of 040 m by 050 m and designed for photographing the corona and the region about the sun with refer ence to the stars there found a second camera with a Darlot lens of six inches 016m giving a field of 26 to 35 plate of 030 m by 040m for the same purpose and a very fine apparatus by Steinheil for studying the corona A second mounting carried several cameras with lenses of four inches 010 m giving a great amount of light and designed to deter mine by very sensitive plates what are the limits of the corona an apparatus of great lightpower the exposure lasting during the whole of totality For spectrum analysis the following apparatus was employed a reflecting telescope of 050 m aper ture having a very short focus 160 m and supplied with a directvision spectroscope of ten prisms the slit of the spectroscope could be placed at different positionangles and rapidly opened or closed at the pleasure of the observer An excellent finder sup plied with a reticule was placed near the spectroscope and distant from it by such an amount that when one eye had fixed upon some point of the corona in the finder the other could obtain the spectroscopic analysis of this point There was also attached to this telescope a biquartz polariscope by Prazmowski and a spectroscope for showing Respighis rings A

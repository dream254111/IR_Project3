region by radia tion and contact with the snowy peaks cannot be determined It is of course much greater in winter than in summer and depends also on the speed with which the current of air travels Owing to the width of the mountainbarrier the main result is complicated by local details regions of considerable precipitation occurring on the west ern slopes of each important mountainrange with subsidiary drier regions in the lea The last of these regions of precipitation is that of the Rocky Moun tain range properly so called in descending from which a further addition of heat is made to the air which then flows down as a dry and warm current to the east GEORGE M DAWSON Ottawa Canada Dec 31 The Taconic controversy in a nutshell The New York geologists encountered a great group of metamorphic apparently successive and conform able strata extending from the Hudson River east ward into New England 183642 Emimons claimed they were all older than the Pots dam and named them all Taconic His colleagues of the New York survey and their friends of the Cana dian survey regarded them all later than the Pots dam and applied to them the terms of the New York system up to the Medina 1842 Fossils were discovered in some of the eastern belts of this metamorphic series and announced by Hall and others in 1842 rather indicating the whole series was postPotsdam Emmons reexamined the whole and called atten tion to an unconformable overlying of the Hudson River and calciferous upon the older slates of the true Taconic and distinctly reasserted the pre Potsdam age of the Taconic system from which he figured primordial fossils 1844 He was supported by Billings and Barrande and by Colonel Jewett of Albany but as time passed he was ostracized from geological circles The authority of Barrande however was sufficient to convince the opponents of Emmons on the New York and Canadian surveys and they expressed a willingness to abandon the use of the conflicting term  Hudson River group 1862 The Canadian geologists however fertile in the invention of devices of stratigraphic nomenclature renewed the contest by two flank movements one the Huronian phalanx aimed at the lower strata and the other the Quebec coffin aimed at the overlying strata thus rallying the whole discomfited cohort 185561 Emmons died in the midst of this movement As time passed the term  Hudson River group besmirched and hesitating was rehabilitated by being shifted to new ground  that of the Lorraine shales 1877 In Wales Barrande had discovered the primordial zone in Sedgwicks Cambrian but as the Sedg wickian term was then under as strong a ban in England as Taconic was in America Barrandes term was adopted in England and also transferred to the equivalent strata in America Gradually in other places outside the Hudson val ley the primordial fauna came to light the strata taking other Canadian names  St Johns and T1 XNCE VOL VII No 158 Acadian these terms becoming current in the United States Finally the existence and fossiliferous character of a great series of strata occupying exactly the posi tion claimed by Emmons and mapped by him under the term Taconic lying below the Potsdam sand stone has been demonstrated and is admitted by all geologists The term Quebec not being approved and Huronian seeming to collide the later English term Cambrian is applied in America to this very horizon to which Emmons had given the name  Taconic Some of the opponents of Emmons reenforced lately by active younger men revive the fossilif erous character of some of the eastern belts as new matter adding many interesting and valuable details and begin again to fire at the old fort long ago abandoned by Emmons insisting that Emmons is still intrenched there 187285 It seems to me that any fair minded geologist find ing primordial fossils in the strata mapped by Em mons as Taconic lying below the Potsdam would at once admit the strata to be Taconic  just the same as if he found nonTaconic fossils in an area not claimed as Taconic except by a mistake in a preliminary definition corrected by its author he would at once admit those strata were not in the Taconic and were not intended to be so described The same mistake was made by Emmons at first as by his opponents None of them imagined they had to deal with two different and unconformable formations The strata were all either Taconic or Hudson River Emmons approached them from one side the primordial and his opponents from the op posite direction Each had evidence to support his claim and viewed from his own standpoint each was right It is unfair to Emmons and to American geology to insist that this preliminary mistake should consign to oblivion the great fact that in America and by an American geologist was first discovered the primordial zone of geology If the Taconic is to lose its identity because a portion of the original described strata prove to be postPotsdam what shall become of the Hudson River by the same reasoning if it be treated with honesty when nearly all the strata covered originally by it prove to be prePotsdam  If the strata can fairly be divided between the conflicting claims as the structural geology of the region seems to require it would be for the honor of American geology to so divide them It seems however that the extreme antiEmmons partisans will not grant such a division but insist on the utter destruction of every thing that smacks of Taconic N HI WINCHELL Relics from an Indian grave On the Conejo plateau in Ventura county Cal and about fifteen miles from the coast a conical hill rises to the height of a hundred feet with a base of several hundred feet On the south side of this elevation and stretching more than half around it is the re mains of an old Indian town At the top of the hill is a circular depression indicating the spot where once stood the sweat or councilhouse of the tribe that occupied this site Near the centre of the crescentshaped village is the place where the dead were buried Early last month the writer examined this burial place which yielded about a hundred andSCIENCE fifty skeletons deposited from one to five feet below the surface The usual method of sepulture prac tised by the Santa Barbara stock of Indians prevailed here namely the knees were drawn up against the breast and the corpse was buried face downward With the skeletons were found three ollas carved from crystallized talc which were used for cooking purposes two large sandstone mortars finely fin ished used for triturating grain and acorns a sand stone bowl about one inch deep and six inches in diameter two conical pipes and several large beads of serpentine several sheets of mica with hole drilled at the side  a broken tortilla stone several balls of paint and thousands of shell and glass beads wampum ornaments etc In a Haliotis shell H splendens I found eight old fashioned flat brass buttons with numerous specimens of wampum manufactured from Olivella biplicata The remains of a metal knife were discovered which with glass beads buttons and a portion of an oldfashioned waterbottle shows that this place was inhabited since the advent of the white man or within the past three hundred and fortythree years Probably the most interesting relic discovered was a metal fishhook It has a shank about four and a half centimetres in length with a point about three and a half centimetres long which from its shape I should judge was of Indian manufacture An Olivella shell was scalloped or notched leaving it somewhat in the shape of a crown The base was perforated and the shank of the hook pushed through it This was doubtless intended as an attraction to the fish The species is Olivella biplicata some of which are very white and at the end of a line would be nearly or quite equal in brilliancy to the pearl oystershell used by the SouthSea Islanders for the same purpose By the kindness of the publisher of Science an engraving of the fishhook is presented It is in a somewhat restored form the original being corroded to some extent by rust San Buenaventura Dec 8 STEPHEN BOWERS New find of fossil diatoms Seeing a reference to diatoms occurring in clay strata in a railroadcutting near Philadelphia in two of the recent issues of Science I wrote to Dr Koenig the discoverer for a sample of the diatom bearing clay I received the clay promptly and am delighted to be able to say that after a fiveminutes preparation I had the pleasure of noting a very rich slide containing at least thirty species of diatoms 35 the forms corresponding chiefly to the recent fresh water forms but characteristically different as relates to the association of the species when com pared with the forms occurring in the subpeat deposits of the eastern United States My reason for making this communication is that the value interest and importance of this new find of diatomaceous material has not been sufficiently emphasized in the two articles in Science and might be overlooked by diatomists and all who are on the constant lookout for new localities of fossil diatoms K M CUNNINGHAM Amoeboid movement of the cellnucleus The study of the cellnucleus has become a subject of such absorbing interest in biology that we feel justified in asking a little of your space to make known what seems to us a promising field for inves tigation During the last year in studying the blood of Necturus after its removal from the body and in the bloodvessels we were struck with the great size and distinctness of the nucleus of the white corpus cles But what seems especially interesting and important is the fact that the nucleus of the white bloodcorpuscles exhibits a very marked amoeboid movement both in the vessels of a curarized animal and on the microscopic slide These movements are as vigorous and easily followed as are those of the cellbody and often both the cellbody and nucleus are undergoing amoeboid movement at the same time the movements of the cellbody and nucleus seeming to be entirely independent of each other From the ease with which the white corpuscles are obtained and observed from the size and activity of the nucleus and its distinctness in the living condi tion it is confidently expected that the study of the white bloodcorpuscle of Necturus will greatly assist in making more definite our knowledge of the nu cleus its socalled membrane and the processes of its division S H and S P GAGE Anat lab Cornell univ Dec 25 English sparrows In Science Dec 18 appeared some remarks on the English sparrows that do not at all agree with our experience here We have many orchards and groves in and around our village Many of us have provided boxes for wrens martins bluebirds etc Robins cardinals crimsonbreasted grossbeaks cat birds etc are innumerable around us A few years ago some of our people accustomed to watch the many kinds of birds that frequent our court house grove asked me about a little bird that had just newly appeared in the grove They said that it was  driving all the other birds away Not content with merely fighting and mastery it drove the others clear out of the town The people had been watch ing them for some days and reported that half a dozen birds had actually made themselves the sole possessors of our melodious grove heretofore so delightfully noisy with the songs of the many native birds I suspected the cause and as soon as I saw the strange little birds pronounced them to be those winged rats the English sparrows For twenty years I had kept several boxes for martins at my own place About thirty pairs were making their homes at my doors Suddenly I missed them but the screech of a pair of English sparrows took JANUARY 8

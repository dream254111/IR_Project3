growing under arid con ditions in the Tucson region shows that there are two sorts of rootlets which to a degree have similar functions but which usually have an unlike fate Whether analogous plants of the more moist regions have similar rootlets is unknown to the writer A characterization of the rootlets in question can be made by describing those of a typical shrub such as Franseria deltoidea and by referring to anal ogous rootlets of some of the annuals In Franseria the tips of the main roots end in a brush of slender rootlets which bear root hairs Most of these terminal rootlets are formed during the moist seasons generally summer and die during the following dry season but some survive to extend the root system Such rootlets are found on the most deeply penetrating as well as the most shal lowly placed roots But on the more super ficial roots only there is in addition an other type of rootlet These are filamentous 2 cm more or less in length in groups of about one half dozen which occur from 2 to 4 cm apart They arise from older roots only and hence are adventitious Since these rootlets are formed during the moister seasons each year and die during the succeeding dry season and never or almost never persist to form permanent roots I have referred to them as deciduous1 The deciduous rootlets as before suggested are found on roots which are placed near the surface of the soil From this fact and from the known variation in water content of the superficial soil horizon it is assumed that the deciduous rootlets are perhaps the first absorb ing organs after the beginning of the rainy season to function Also owing to the fact that the superficial soil layers are the first to become desiccated it is assumed that the deciduous rootlets cease activities before the The Root Habits of Desert Plants W A Cannon Carnegie Institution of Washington Pub lication No 131 1911 N S VOL XXXV No 903 other type referred to It is probable there fore that the deciduous rootlets are of great importance in providing water absorption sur face during the time of maximum or opti mum water supply and that the second type of rootlets in deeper soil lingering longer serve to provide the plant with water during a longer period probably until the next season of precipitation Undoubtedly an important factor in the physiology of water absorption and in the water relation generally speaking is that of the distance of water transport Where the distance from the point of absorption to the place of evaporation is great it is probable that a given amount of water is less efficient in a longer than in a shorter transport We have in the formation of the deciduous root lets the interesting condition that the water absorption surface is enormously increased without at the same time increasing the dis tance of water transport The importance of this in the physiology of the plant will appear at a glance Nearly all perennials which have been ex amined are provided with deciduous rootlets It is not supposed however that these root lets are essentially different from the other type although they have a different origin and although they appear to have a somewhat dif ferent function From a few instances it has been seen that permanent roots may be derived from groups of rootlets which probably were indistinguishable from the deciduous rootlets but which were so fortunately placed that survival was possible An analogous condition but naturally dif fering in many ways is to be found in the rootsystems of several desert annuals In such forms in addition to the usual and of course ephemeral absorbing roots there are at the base of many laterals rudimentary rootlets These may remain rudimentary never developing or if the moisture condi tions favor they may develop Where such rootlets are not found it seems from certain experiments that they can not easily be in duced Probably the greatest advantage to an annual bearing rudimental rootlet is thatSCIENCE should there be a return of rains following a rainy season so soon after the rainy season that the annuals are still living the rudimen tary roots quickly develop enabling the plant to complete its growth or to renew it The matter of distance of water transport in the annuals would hardly come into the problem W A CANNON DESERT LABORATORY THE EFFECT OF NARCOTICS UPON THE DEVELOP MENT OF THE HENS EGG ONE of the evident difficulties experienced in experimentation with the eggs of birds is that due to their large size which makes it impossible to use the large numbers of eggs that may be handled in the case of fishes or amphibians Also while it is usually possible to obtain eggs at any season of the year if one be willing to pay the price the percentage of infertile eggs is usually so high except during the spring that the time for profitable experi mentation is quite limited The experiments here described are of a purely preliminary nature It is the purpose of the writer to continue the experiments until the number of eggs used will justify some general conclusions The reagents used were alcohol ether chloroform chlorotone and magnesium chlo ride One or two of these proved so almost universally fatal in their effects that they will probably not be employed in further experi mentation AlcoholThis reagent was employed as follows the eggs were placed in the incubator and left for a number of hours five to seven teen in different experiments they were then placed in a glass specimen jar having a glass cover with raw cotton wet with from 1 to 5 cc of 95 per cent alcohol the jar was covered and replaced in the incubator where it was left for from three to twelve hours after which the eggs were removed from the atmosphere of alcohol thoroughly aired and replaced in the incubator which had also been aired for about fortyeight hours before being opened The glass jar was of about 1200 cc capacity and not more than eight 633 eggs were placed in it at once so that there was a considerable volume of air for each egg When the lid was removed to take the eggs from the jar there was always a strong smell of alcohol Of the eggs treated in this way only about 25 per cent contained living embryos when opened About half of the embryos obtained from these eggs were abnormal to a greater or less extent The character of the abnormali ties will be described when further experi ments have furnished more material EtherThe experiments with ether were conducted in the same general manner as those with alcohol except that as a rule only 1 or 2 cc of ether were used The effect of ether seemed to be much less severe than that of alcohol only about 35 per cent of the embryos being killed Of the embryos removed from the eggs less than half were abnormal ChloroformChloroform was employed in the same manner as was ether and while fewer experiments were tried not a single egg opened after being submitted to this reagent contained a living embryo showing that it is much more toxic in effect under these condi tions than either alcohol or ether ChlorotoneThis reagent was employed as a 1 per cent solution in distilled water In one experiment the eggs were kept in the incubator for ten hours before introducing the chlorotone in the other experiments the chlorotone was introduced into the fresh egg The method employed was to carefully re move about a square centimeter of shell from the side of the egg and with a clean glass tube blow out about 5 to 10 cc of the albu men without touching the yolk the space thus made was filled with the reagent the opening was then sealed with a piece of fresh shell with strips of shell membrane stuck around the edge with some of the albumen that had been blown out of the egg This is the method of closing an incubating egg used by Miss Peebles This treatment proved fatal to more than 90 per cent of the embryos but a few control experiments where the eggs were opened and APRIL 19

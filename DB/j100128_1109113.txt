through fees An article of the State constitution prohibited the increase of an officers compensation after his election and during his term of office By statute the compensation of justices of the peace was changed from tees to a monthly salary Under this statute the petitioner sues for his salary Held since the facts do not show that there was an actual increase of salary the act is constitutional for it changes the mode and not the amount of compensation McCauley v Culbert Cal 1904 77 Pac 923 In the absence of constitutional prohibition the legislature has full power to change the salary or compensation attached to an office People ex rel Muraphy v LzRpincott 1873 67 Ill 333 It is however very general for the constitution to prohibit either increase or decrease of compensation during the term of office Gross v Kenfield I881 57 Cal 626 Cox v Burlington 1876 43 Ia 612 And then any attempt by the legislature to alter the compensation will be unconstitutional See Rooney v Supervisors I876 40 Wis x The principal case presents a situation where all the Constitution prohibited was an increase of salary and since the facts did not show that the change from fees to a monthly salary was an increase no case of unconstitutionality was established AGENCYREVOCATION BY DEATH OF PRINCIPAL The plaintiff sought to foreclose a mortgage given to secure a note The mortgaged premises were conveyed by the maker of the note to the defendant After the death of the payee of the note the defendant in ignorance of the death made a payment to the agent of the payee The agent became insolvent and never paid this sum to the representatives of the principal Held that the death of the principal did not invalidate this payment so as to entitle the plaintiff to foreclose the mortgage Meinhardt v Newman Neb I904 99 N W 261 The case follows the rule of the civil law that death ipso facto with out notice does not terminate the agency Such a rule has much in its favor in point of justice It is followed in some jurisdictions Cassiday v McKenzie Pa 1842 4 W  S 282 Though it is well settled that a power coupled with an interest survives the death of the principal Hunt v Rousmanier 1823 8 Wheat 174 yet a mere naked power is ter minated by the death of the principal Mechem on Agency 245 The reason underlying the rule is convincing As a dead man can do no act so his heirs and representatives should not be bound by the act of a per son whom possibly they do not know and would nor trust Clayton v Alerrit I876 52 Miss 353 BAILMENTSWAREHOUSEMANLIMITATION OF LIABILITY The plaintiff stored apples in the defendants warehouse During the winter through the negligence of the defendant the apples were damaged by freezing The defendant endeavored to relieve himself from liability by proving that he gave a receipt containing the words  At owners risk Held that the giving of such a receipt did not relieve the defendant from lia bility for negligence Denver Public Warehouse Co v Munger Col 1904 77 Pac 5 A bailee for hire may limit his liability by a special contract and in the absence of fraud according to the weight of authority may contract away his

See Notes p 596 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWHABEAS CORPUSPOWER OF FEDERAL COURTS A prisoner was in prison pending an appeal to a state court from a convic tion of murder He applied to a federal court for release upon a writ of habeas corpus alleging that he had been denied his constitutional rights Held the writ would not issue since petitioners remedy was by appeal to the State court and by writ of error to the United States Supreme Court Ex parte Powers D C W D Ky 129 Fed 985 The powers of federal courts by writ of habeas corpus are limited to cases where the custody is in violation of the federal constitution or laws U S Comp St 1901 p 592 The sole inquiry in such case is whether the judgment is a nullity having been rendered by a court not having constitutional power or authority In re Friederich 1893 149 U S 70 The petition in the principal case raises no question of jurisdiction but addresses itself merely to irregularities of procedure and erroneous rulings of the court Upon a writ of habeas corpus the judgment and pro ceedings of a State court should not be reviewed by a federal court even though it be claimed that the petitioner was denied some constitutional 598RECENT DECISIONS 599 right Marhuson v Boucher 1899 175 U S I84 Such matters are properly cognizable only upon writ of error In re Schneider I893 148 U S I62 Since the petitioner has open to him an appeal to

his constitu tional rights denied him he may have a writ of error to the U S Su preme Court CONSTITUTIONAL LAWOBLIGATION OF CONTRACTIMPAIRtMENT BY STATE LAWS The plaintiff had a contract with the defendant for installing a heating plant in a State public school When the contract was made with the school board the laws of the State had made the board a cor porate body with power to sue and be sued After the contract was made the State deprived the board of the power to sue and be sued Held the power to sue and be sued which the State gave the board was no part of the contract and can be revoked by the State without im pairing any contract obligation Wheeler v Board of Control of State Public Schools Mich I904 Ioo N W 394 Since the school board was a creature of the State and in a sense its agent the suit against it was in effect regarded as a suit against the State The general doctrine is that a State cannot be sued against its consent Railroad Co v Tennessee 1879 xoI U S 337 but that it may waive this immunity Clark v Barnard 882 IO8 U S 436 447 As over against the right of the State stands the prohibition of the United States Constitution against laws impairing contract obligations It would seem as if the act of the State in the principal case did impair plaintiffs contract right This would be a logical view to take but the courts have not followed it  The notion that the State could not be sued against its consent or unless it waived the privilege of sovereignty was too strong to be overcome See Beers v Arkansas 1857 20 How 527 Cooleys Cons Lim p 388 CONSTITUTIONAL LAwPOLICE POWERORDINANCESDUTY TO REPAIR SIDEWALKS A city ordinance required owners or occupants of real prop erty to keep the sidewalks in front of their premises in repair The plaintiff having been injured by a defect in the sidewalk in front of the premises of which he was tenant brought suit against the city The city set up the defense of contributory negligence Held the statute in so far as it appliedto mere tenants of property was unconstitutional and the plaintiff not being under a duty to repair was not chargeable with contributory negligence Ford v Kansas City Mo I904 79 S W 923 The courts have usually upheld ordinances imposing upon property owners the duty of constructing and keeping in repair the sidewalks adjoining their premises or of removing snow and ice therefrom as a just exercise of the police power on the ground that owners are peculiarly interested in the improvement and are peculiarly fitted by their situation to perform the work promptly Cooleys Cons Lim 7th ed p 860 Pax son v Sweet 1832 13 N J L I96 Bonsall v Mayor 1850 I9 Ohio 418 The duty of removing snow and ice has been extended to the case of tenant or occupants Dillons Mun Corp  394 In re Goddard Mass 1835 i6 Pick 504 Inhabitants of Clinton v Welch I896 i66 Mass 133 No authority can be found as to the right to impose upon a mere oc cupant the duty to repair the sidewalk This duty would seem as great as that of constructing them in the first instance Indeed some courts repudiate ordinances requiring owners to repair the sidewalk or remove snow and ice Gridley v Bloomnngton 1878 88 Ill 554 State v Jack man 1898 69 N H 318 The principal case seems correct in not impos ing the duty of repairing upon the tenant CONSTITUTIONAL LAWPOLICE POWERSREGULATION OF EMPLOYMENT AGENCY

up the uncon stitutionality of the act Held the act creates an unjust discrimination is opposed to the constitutional guaranty of protection in possession of property and is not within the police power of the State Ex parte Dickey Cal 1904 77 Pac 924 It is well recognized that the State may in its exercise of the police power disturb property and contractual rights Corn v Alger I851 7 Cush 53 See Lawzon v Steele I893 152 U S I33 The extent to which it may go is the question It has been said that the test to be ap plied is whether the act has reference  to the comfort safety or welfare of society Cooleys Const Lim 837 What trades or occupations con cern the public safety comfort and welfare must always be a question of fact to be determined by a cautious exercise of judicial discretion The courts of the State where the principal case is decided have already recognized the difficulty and delicacy of the task in this respect Ex parteJentzsch I896 112 Col 468 See Laws of New York x9o4

engaged in an  interstate  business His sole business was to load and store grain from outside the State then to reload it for points within the State Held the relators business was of an interstate character and as such not sub ject to the tax People ex rel Connecting Terminal R Co 1904 I78 N Y 194 It has been repeatedly held that elevators though efficient means of promoting interstate commerce are not within the protection of the com merce clause of the federal Constitution Munn v Illinois i876 94 U S 113 Buddv New York 1892 143 U S 5I7 Unlike the principal case these cases did not show that the service of the elevators was a part of a continuous interstate carriage on through bills of lading From the principal case it would seem that the existence of a single contract cover mg the

provided that any controversy under the agreement should be sub mitted to the Circuit Court and that its decision should be final On an appeal from the decision of the Circuit Court it was held the agree ment was binding and that no appeal could be taken even though the result was to oust the Supreme Court of jurisdiction Hoste v Dalton Mich 1904 xoo N W 750 An agreement to arbitrate which in effect ousts all courts of jurisdic tion is held to be against public policy White v Middlesex R R 1883 135 Mass 216 Sanford v Accident Assn 1895 147 N Y 326 But agreements to submit to arbitration questions of daTmage or loss as a condition precedent to bringing suit are generally upheld since the effect of such agreements is to facilitate the work of the court and to arrive at a more accurate

Canal Co v Coal Co supra and indeed the tendency seems to be to give effect to the intention of the parties Daley v Loan Assn 1901 178 Mass 13 The result in theRECENT DECISIONS 601 rincipal case

directed the jury to return a verdict of acquittal The direction was given immediately after the opening statement of the prosecuting attorney before any evidence given and over the States exception

NOTES p 590 CRIMINAL LAWCONSTRUCTION OF STATUTE CHANGING PUNISIHMENT A statute changed the punishment of imprisonment from determinate to indeterminate periods Held statutes changing punishment for

duplicate one to each party The copy pro duced by the lessor showed the erasure of an important clause in the contract as originally drawn which clause was not erased in the copy produced by the defendant the lessee Held the burden of proof was on the lessor to show that the erasure was made before sign ing or with the consent of the lessee Witeadon v Turregano La 1904 36 So Rep 808 The civil

Gray 439 Kennedy v Moore 1882 I7 S C 464 Other American courts presume that the change was made with author ity Hagan v Ins Co t89o SI Iowa 32X Since it is hard to say that there is such a uniform experience in such cases as to give rise to a pre sumption the better rule seems to be that the time of such alteration should be found by the jury as are ordinary facts in the absence of pre sumption Robinson v Myers I870 67 Pa St 9 In the principal case the suspicious circumstances were such evidence that the alterations were made subsequently as to justify the result in any event HABEAS CORPUSJURISDICTION OF COURTS OVER DESERTER FROM ARMY A deserter was arrested more than two years after the expiration of the term of his enlistment A statute prescribed that there should be no punishment after two years Held although the statute of limitations would probably be a good defense before the court martial yet a civil court could not grant a writ of habeas corpus since the deserter had never been discharged from the army and was therefore still subject to the jurisdiction of a military tribunal In re Cadwallader C C Mo 1904 I27 Fed 88I By the early English statutes desertion was a felony punishable in the civil courts King v Beal I687 3 Mod 124 see also Tyler v Pomeroy Mass 1864 8 Allen 480 But after the Revolution of I688 the602 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW old statutes were superseded by the Mutiny Act St i W  M ch 5  2 which made desertion a purely military crime punishable even in time of peace by a court martial In the United States the line between civil and military jurisdiction has always been maintained Kurtz v Moffitt 1885 Ix5 U S 487 The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States expressly excepts  cases arising in the land and naval

jured by the derailing of his engine caused by the failure of a brakeman in the defendants employ and on the same train to set a switch properly Held the proper setting of switches is an element of providing a safe track and the responsibility therefor can not be assigned by the master to his servant Rzichey v Southern Ry Co S C 1904 48 S E 285 The operation of a switch is not a personal nonassignable duty of a master rendering the person operating it his representative instead of a fellow servant of one injured through its misuse Daves v So Pac Co 1893 98 Cal 19 St Lozis R R Co v

WARRANTSISSUANCE After a claim against a county had been allowed the auditor drew a warrant payable to the claimant in payment thereof and himself acquired the money from the treasury by a forged indorsement Held the warrant had not been issued to satisfy a statute requiring that the auditor should  issue a warrant and not having been  issued his successor might be com pelled to do it by mandamus American Bridge Co v Wheelock Wash 1904 76 Pac 534 This case suggests the novel question as to when a warrant is issued There is authority for the idea that a warrant is issued when it has actually been delivered or put into circulation irrespective of whether the person to whom it comes be the one entitled to enforce it State v Pierce 1893 52 Kas 521 The principal case is for the proposition that it must come into the hands of an authorized person before it is  issued Nevertheless the original county auditor had been convicted of embezzlement of the funds on the theory of agency for the person to whom it was drawn State v Raby 1903 31 Wash iII Principle and justice seem to be subserved in holding the transaction no issuance until the warrant has come into authorized hands PLEADING AND PRACTICEAiMOUNTS DETERMINING JURISDrCTION COUNTERCLAIM Upon suitin a magistrates court the defendant attempted to set up a counterclaim for a sum exceeding the statutory jurisdiction of the court Held that as the counterclaim was anew action the court could not entertain it since it was not within its jurisdiction Corley v Evans 1904 48 S E 459 Many courts of limited jurisdiction follow the principal case in hold ing that they have no jurisdiction over a counterclaim larger than their jurisdictional amount on the theory that the counterclaim is a new action Alemeida v Siegerson 1855 20 Mo 497 Guswold v Pieratt 1895 Ixo Cal 259 The better rule however seems to regard the counterclaim as part of the same action and the amount demanded by the plaintiff once having given the court jurisdiction over the original action the courts jurisdiction holds over the counterclaim provided there is no statutory prohibition The NY Code of Civil Procedure 2945 as to justices courts admits the counterclaim even though it exceeds the sum for which the court could take jurisdiction in a new and distinct action Howard Iron Works v Buffalo El Co 1903 176 N Y I 4

court does in the principal case that the judge could have been challenged on the ground of interest there is a conflict of authority as to whether the defendants plea would operate as a waiver604 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW or not Holmes v Eason Tenn I882 8 Lea 754 People v Connor 1894 142 N Y 130 At common law the right to object to a judge on the ground of interest was considered a personal

of judges the courts of some of the States follow the common law rule Floyd Co v Cheney 188I 57 Ia I6o Holmes v Eason supra But the weight of authority is that the judge does not have jurisdiction

persuaded toputup 50oo of his own with the stakeholder  to make a showing as he was informed in the event a count of the stake money was demanded As a matter of fact all the money on both sides belonged to the defendants who had thus conspired to swindle the plaintiff Held although the plaintiff was in delicto he was not in pari delicto with the conspirators and where plaintiff demanded back

condition of the sidewalk does not show as a matter of law the existence of contributory negligence where the party forgets such state of facts it being only evidence for the jury city of Maysville v Guilfoyle 1901 IIo Ky 670 Virgin v City of Saginaw I901 125 Mich 499 The courts however draw a dis tinction between forgetfulness and heedlessness King v Coloz 1901 125 Mich 5 I Where such knowledge is shown to be present at the time of injury an assumption of the risk can be made out and where such knowledge existed before its presence might be presumed as a matter of law in the absence of extraordinary facts as excitement fright etc The use of the word  forget  must lead to confusion The question is ulti mately whether the plaintiff acted as an ordinarily prudent man wouldbe expected to act under the circumstances Beach Contributory Negli gence  9COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW TORTSTROVERCORRELATIVE DUTIES The plaintiff was evicted from a house occupied by her as a boarding house under a dispossessory writ secured by the defendant who took possession of her furniture therein From certain rooms she had removed defendants furniture and had sub stituted her own Held that she could not maintain trover for any part of her own furniture until she had returned or offered to return that owned by defendant Hojfman v Wilson C C A 3rd Circ 1904 130 Fed 694 As to the plaintiffs property specifically substituted for that of defend ant the court in the principal case seems to be justified in implying that the plaintiff agreed to allow the defendant to use such property until she should return that of the defendant 7ackson v Ap5oleton I888 2 N Y Supp 787 As to the remainder of the plaintiffs property no such agreement could be implied Although the plaintiff is under a moral duty to return the defendants furniture before making claim for this part of her own her right to such property is complete and her correlative duty to return the defendants property not being a precedent legal duty cannot destroy her right to immediate possession The principal case seems to be allowing counterclaim in tort TRUSTSRES DETERMINABLE BY TRUSTEES DISCRETION Property was devised to a widow upon trust that so much of it as to her may seem proper be allotted to the assistance of certain persons In an action brought to enforce the trust upon her refusal to perform it the court held that even though she refused to exercise the discretion conferred upon her the trust was not defeated Prince v Barrow Ga 1904 48 S E 412 On the theory that a thing subject to reasonably accurate ascertain ment by computation is sufficiently definite for the trust res a trust for the support or maintenance of a person is allowed as equity can determine to a reasonable degree the amount of the res Hunter v Slenbridge 1852 12 Ga I92 Colton v Colton I888 127 U S 300 Perry on Trusts 5th ed Ix6 To carry this doctrine to the principal case where the amount lies wholly within the discretion of the trustee as the mere word assistance  would make it seems to enter the realm of uncertainty as to the trust subject matter Lines v Darden I853 5 Fla 51 Perry on Trusts  II9 and the better rule is to consider that word as creating merely a moral obligation Benson v Whittan Eng 183I 5 Sim 22 606

perhaps the size of a goose egg 2 in elongated cylindrical forms sometimes incompletely perfor ated longitudinally and 3 as rounded grains forming one of the constituents of a loosely coherent silicious sandstone The ma terial is of a grayish color on the outer surface indicating oxida tion but interiorly it has all the characteristics of genuine bees wax both as regards physical conditions color smell fusing point and conduct towards chemical reagents In the letter accompanying the wax is said to be found in masses of all sizes up to 250 pounds weight that it occurs imbed ded in the sand being found while digging clams at low tide and at a depth of 20 feet below the surface when digging wells The material has been traced for a distance of 30 miles up the river Tradition has it that many hundred years ago a foreign vessel some say a Chinese junk laden with wax was wrecked off this coast This at first thought seems plausible but aside from the difficulty of accounting for the presence in these waters and at that date of a vessel loaded with wax it seems scarcely credible that the material could have been brought in a single cargo in such quantities nor buried so deeply over so large an area In a fragment of the sandstone above alluded to the wax occurs in disseminated grains less than half the size of a pins head and in such abundance that when ignited the stone falls away to a loose gray silicious sand My correspondent states that the material has been mined by the whites for ever 20 years but not to any great extent excepting the last 8 or 10 years during which time many hundred tons have been shipped to San Francisco and Port land and sold at the rate of 18 cents per pound Concerning the accuracy of the account as above given the present writer knows nothing It is here given in the hope of gaining more information on the subject GEORGE P MERRILL U S National Museum Washington DC June 9 Books for Children WILL some specialists in natural history recommend some really satisfactory cheap books suitable for the guidance of children ten years of age in their rambles through the fields and woods Most of the cheap books that I have seen do not give the necessary de tails for identifying specimens and yet the naming of what is seen or collected is necessary for arousing enthusiasm in studying the forms of life Some of the topics which I am inquiring about are as follows The naming of free birds from their size plumage song and habits and the place and manner of constructing nests and habits of nesting The naming of trees and shrubs from their bark and leaves The naming of weeds and flowers found growing wild in the eastcentral part of the United States The naming of land snails beetles butterflies and moths and their habits Perhaps the Agassiz associations have made out lists of the specimens to be found in the various regions of the United States If this has been done I have not happened to see any notice of it In this connection I wish to mention the work done by my own teacher in a suburban school at Cincinnati more than twenty years ago The superintendent of the school Mr A G Weatherby afterwards a professor in the Cincinnati University was an inde fatigable collector in various departments of natural history and his enthusiasm was communicated to his pupils so strongly that there was hardly a boy in his schoolroom who had not a collec tion of local moths landsnail shells and freshwater clamshells We had them all properly prepared and Mr Weatherby named them for us but we learned the localities in which different species were to be found through the broad experience of our teacher and not from books In fact although many of our class of boys had almost complete sets of local snailshells and all named yet I doubt if any of us ever looked into a work on corep chology I do not know whether any of Mr Weatherbys early pupils have since become professional naturalists as a resuPl of his teachings but I do know that the collecting excursions made VOL XXI No 54I under his direction were most beneficial as a means of sharpening our powers of observation and added immensely to the happiness of boyhood I am sure that many readers of Science will be glad to get infor mation such as I have asked for as very few parents are able to help their children in classifying and naming the finds that they are continually bringing in from the fields FRANK WALDO Princeton NJ June 5 Worms in the Brain of a Bird IN your issue of June 2 is a communication Relative to Worms in the Brain of a Bird Your

P1 VI I find a short paper by Mr H Herzer on A New Tree from the Carboniferous Rocks of Monroe County Ohio in which he describes under the name of Winchellina fascina a new genus and species The discovery of a new genus of plants in the Carboniferous a formation of which the flora is now so very well known is of itself of considerable interest but when we learn that it was an endogenous tree the interest deepens and the discovery if true would be the most important addition to our knowledge of the ancestors of this great group of plants that has been made in many years The Carboniferous has been called the age of ferns from the great abundance and high state of development enjoyed by thi class of plants in this part of the Paleozoic system Several sup posed endogens have been reported from the Paleozoic but they have sooner or later been shown to belong to other vegetable classes and at the present time there is not a single form accepted by paleobotanists as belonging to this age In fact it is not until well up into the Mesozoic that undoubted endogens made their appearance This is of course negative evidence but it is so strong that it requires the most positive and convincing evidence to prove their earlier ancestry The literature relating to the internal structure of plants of the Paleozoic is now very extensive and from a careful study of this it appears almost beyond question that the supposed new endo genous tree is a fernstem of a wellknown type I have not seen the original trunk or sections cut from it but judging from the somewhat imperfect description and figures it is impossible to see any differences of importance between Winchellina fascina and Psaronius cottce corda1 from the Permian of Saxony It also approaches very closely to Tubiculites Psaronius relaxato maximus2 GrandEury a fernstem from the Carboniferous of central France The cellbundles described by Mr Herzer are quite unlike those of any monocotyledon with which I am fa miliar but agree well with those described for fernstems from the older rocks The reference of this plant to the ferns is also quite in accord with facts that have long been known for Dr Newberry recorded the genus Psaronius as occurring  in great abundance in the Carboniferous rocks of Ohio more than forty years ago The genus Psaronius is a somewhat comprehensive one and a number of more or less satisfactory genera have recently been separated out of it by Williamson Renault Zeiller and others and it is possible that when the fossil under discussion is more 1 Stenzel Ueber die

article  SunHeat and Orbital Eccentricity Science Apr 28 gives occasion to say a work in regard to mean values Since the mean value of n quantities is the arithmetic mean of their sum it would appear at first glance as if the term were a perfectly definite one but if the quantities to be averaged are successive values of a function of some variable then clearly their magnitudes depend not only on the nature of the function but also on the law of variation of the fundamental Thus suppose we have the isotherm p v  c and wish to know the average pressure between the volumes v  v and v  v2 It is necessary to make some assumption in regard to the variation of v If its increments are supposed equal we understand by the  mean value of the pressure the average of the pressures corresponding to the values of v If the volume is assumed to depend in turn on some other variable in such a manner that the abscissaincrements are not equal the mean value will now be the average of the new series of pressureordinates corresponding to the series of values of v arising under the second assumption Evidently these two means will in general be unequal but one is just as properly the 4 real average  as the other The formula for mean value may be derived by a method even simpler than the usual analytical one as given by Williamson and Todhunter Let it be required to find the mean value of y where y  f x and x is an equicrescent variable If y f x be treated as a curve referred to rectangular b axes  x dx is the expression for the area A bounded by a the Xaxis two ordinates and the portion of the curve intercepted between the bounding ordinates Let A A where A is a rectangle whose base equals the base of A Then the altitude of A is the average of the ordinates in A For let Yt  Y2   Y  Yn o 71 the average of the series of ordinates Then Y1  2        Yo  Y o   on to n terms Multiplying by A x and summing 2 4Yr  Y2    A X   yo  YO    A Ax or making n indefinitely large b b y dx yo dx yo ba a b y dx A hence yo b a  A But and since b  a is the base of the rectangle A yo is it salti tude For example let it be required to find the mean pressure be tween the volumes v1 and V2 If the isotherm is p vc the area A in this case becomes V2 J cLdv clogV2 Vt its base is v2  v1 hence the mean pressure is c log  v V2V1 VI This conception of mean values may be readily g  ed when a curve is expressed in polar coordinates If r f 0 let x be written for 0 and y for r The Cartesian equation thus arising furnishes a curve which sustains peculiar relations to the original polar curve The ra iiivectores are taken out of their fanshaped arrangement and platied equidistant and parallel with their ex tremities on the comon line the Xaxis The pole may be viewed 333 as having developed into this axis whilst a circle of unit radius with pole as centre has developed into a straight line parallel to the axis the radiivectores keeping their normal position with respect to the circle In finding the mean value of the radius vector of an ellipse d 0 being constant the figure A has three rec tilinear sides x  0 x  7r and the Xaxis Its fourth side is the curve y a 1  e2 1  e cos x The base of the figure is 7r hence the mean value is 7r 1 aje2 dxa V1 le2 7r  1  e cosx It will be seen that the areamethod serves only when the ordi nates are equally distributed throughout the area A In the dynamical problem of the earths mean distance from the sun it is not 0 or x which is the equicrescent variable but t the time A must therefore be taken equal to t2 tl r dt for which r ft must be given but as is well known the equation expressing the relation between r and t is transcendental and cannot be written in the form r f t Recourse must therefore be had to other devices for finding the mean distance when the problem is rendered kinematical by taking Keplers second law into account ELLEN HAYES Wellesley Mass Iron and Aluminium in Bone Black WILL you kindly in your next issue print the

G WIECHMANN New York June 7 Estimated Distance of Phantoms IN Science of May 19 p 269 Mr Bostwick mentions the fa miliar experiment of binocular combination of regular patterns such as a tessellated pavement or figured wallpaper by means of ocular convergence and states that in his case although the figures of the phantom thus formed appear smaller yet contrary to the statements of all other writers they do not appear nearer but farther off than the real object This seems to me inexplica ble if the phantom is really distinct As I have very unusual facility in making such binocular com binations I will very briefly describe an experiment of this kind I stand now looking down on the tesselated oilcloth covering the floor of the library By ocular convergence I slide the two images of the floor over one another in such wise as to combine contiguous figures After perhaps a brief interval of indistinct ness the pattern appears with perfect clearness at half the dis tance of the floor and the figures of the pattern of half the real size The sense of reality is just as perfect as in the case of a real floor at that distance It seems to me as if I could rap it with my knuckle Taking now this phantom as a real object by greater convergence the plane can be brought up higher and higher until by extreme convergence it is brought within three inches of the root of the nose and seen there with the greatest distinctness in exquisite miniature the figures being only one quarter inch in diameter By relaxing the convergence a little the phantomplane may be dropped and caught on lower

CONSULAR JURISDICTION THE domicil of persons living under consular jurisdiction in foreign countries presents a problem of unique importance not only because of the concern which a large number of peo ple have in its proper solution but also because of its relation to the conception of domicil and to the requisites by which the existence of domicil is to be determined This problem may be concisely stated in the form of a question as follows Is it possible for a person residing abroad under consular protection to acquire a dom icil of choice in the country of residence There are no apparent obstacles to the acquisition of such a domicil and on superficial consideration it would seem that the question might be readily answered in the affirmative The question has been answered in the affirmative after careful consideration in the only Am erican cases in which the precise point has been raised The English courts on the other hand seem to be fully committed to the contrary view The Court of Appeal has decided in the recent case of Casdagli v Casdagli2 that a British subject cannot acquire a domicil of choice under such circumstances The conflict of judi cial opinion thus presented may be approached most advantageously through a preliminary consideration of the antecedents of the English rule There are several factors of which account must be taken if one is to understand the difficulty which the English courts have ex perienced in arriving at a solution of the problem In the first place there has always been a rather deeply rooted judicial pre judice against the notion of Christian domicil in heathen lands 1 In re Allens Will United States Court for China Term at Shanghai August 1907 in I American Journal of International Law 1029 Mather v Cunningham 105 Me 326 1909  87 L J P 73 I917MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Lord Stowells famous dictum in The Indian Chief with regard to the immiscible character of European settlements in the Orient3 has been quoted many times Dr Lushington declared in Maltass v Maltass that every presumption is against the intention of British Christian subjects voluntarily becoming domiciled in the dominions of the Porte4 More recently in the case of The Derfflinger No I it has been asserted that the waters of Alpheus still flow un defiled and where European Powers enjoy the privilege of exter ritorial jurisdiction their subjects never lose their native charac ter5 The importance of this factor cannot be measured with ex actness but it is quite clear that it has had an appreciable influence upon the course of judicial decisions Another source of difficulty has been the disposition to seek an analogy in the rule of the prize courts as to commercial domicil un der exterritorial jurisdiction The British prize courts have held consistently that the neutral or enemy character of persons engaged in trade in foreign countries under exterritorial protection is to be determined by the character of the state which exercises such pro tection The leading authority on the point is Lord Stowells fa mous judgment in The Indian Chief6 where it was held that the neutral or enemy character of a person engaged in trade in the Orient under the protection of a European association or factory is to be determined by the character of the association or factory Lord Stowell remarked that in the East from the oldest time an immiscible character has been kept up foreigners are not admitted into the general body and mass of the society of the nation they continue strangers and sojourners as all their fathers wereDoris amara suam non intermiscuit undam not acquiring any na tional character under the general sovereignty of the country and not trading under any recognized authority of their own original country they have been held to derive their present character from that of the association or factory under whose protection they live and carry on their trade7 The modern application of Lord Stowells principle has been made during the recent war by the British prize courts for Egypt In the 3 C Rob I2 29 i Rob Eccl 67 80 6 Br  Col P C 386 388 63 C Rob 12 22 i8oo 73 C Rob I2 22 29 See

German subject residing in China under German consular jurisdiction but it was held that an enemy subject cannot acquire a commercial domicil outside the country of his allegiance by residing abroad under the jurisdiction of his countrys consular courts President Cator quoted thelanguage of Lord Stowell with approval and continued In those days factories as they were called still flourished in the Orient   Since that time the grouping has under gone a change Communities which in those days were not trading under any recognized authority of their own original country have now sorted themselves out into communities of different nations definitely controlled by their home Gov ernments which legislate for them in virtue of rights acquired by custom or definitely conceded by native potentates The trading bond has given way to one of nationality But al lowing for this difference the words of Lord Stowell are just as applicable in these days as they were more than a hundred years ago The waters of Alpheus still flow unde filed and where European Powers enjoy the privilege of exterritorial jurisdiction their subjects never lose their na tive character Each community continues its distinctive ex istence governed by its own consuls and subject to the laws of its mother country9 President Cator was not inclined to assimilate commercial domicil as a test of neutral or enemy character to civil domicil generally10 A somewhat different attitude was taken in the later case of The Liitzow and The Koerberl It was claimed that goods shipped 8 i Br  Col P C 386 I915 9 i Br  Col P C 386 388 10 That he regarded the question of commercial domicil as essentially different from that of civil domicil is shown by the following passage from his opinion From time to time questions as to the status of British subjects in China and the Ottoman Dominions have come before our Courts and it has been settled that no British subject can change his legal domicile by residence in any place where the Crown has exterritorial authority That as we know to our cost owing to the great inconvenience which it has entailed upon the British community is I think the effect of In re Tootals Trusts    approved of by the Privy Council in AbdulMessih v Farra    These decisions it is true relate only to the subtle and artificial doctrine of personal domicile which has been evolved by our civil Courts for the purpose of determining questions relating principally to probate and administration and a legal domicile for the purpose of a Court of Probate is I need hard ly say a very different thing from a commercial domicile for the purpose of a Prize Court i Br  Col P C 386 389 The two cases cited by President Cator are dis cussed infra 11 Br  Col P C 528 I915 439MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW by German merchants in China should be regarded as neutral prop erty because the owners had acquired a neutral commercial domicil Counsel conceded that it might be impossible to acquire a civil domi cil under similar circumstances but contended that the arguments against civil domicil were not applicable because civil and conmmer cial domicil are fundamentally different The Court held that com mercial domicil cannot be established under consular jurisdiction and expressed the opinion that to a considerable extent at least the arguments against civil domicil may be applied to defeat a claim of commercial domicil Judge Grain concluded Although I have been much impressed by the judgment in Mather v Cunningham12    and the review of the British cases in that judgment nevertheless I am of opinion that at the present time the British law is that neither a civil nor a commercial domicil can be established by an individual who is resident or carrying on business in a foreign land when his country has been granted the privileges of extraterritorial ityl3 It is not necessary to consider here the usefulness in prize cases of an analogy between civil and commercial domicil under exter ritorial jurisdiction On the other hand it seems clear enough that the rules of commercial domicil by which prize courts determine neutral or enemy character do not furnish a helpful analogy in solving the more difficult problem of civil domicil Commercial and civil domicil are fundamentally different14 Indeed the point would be almost too obvious for comment if the prize cases had not been invoked so persistently in arguing the question of civil domicil The anomalous notion of AngloIndian domicil has been the source of much more serious confusion This notion grew up dur ing the rule of the East India Company in India British sub jects in the service of the Company in India were held to acquire 13 Discussed infra 13 I Br  Col P C 528 532 It is clear from the cases Maltass v Maltass    TootaPs Trusts In re    and AbdulMessih v Farra    that in British law a civil domicile cannot be established in countries where extraterritoriality runs Ibid 530 14 See Dicey Conflict of Laws app notes 3 and 4 But such factories are not re garded as colonies or foreign countries for the purpose of domicil There may be commer cial domicil there in times of war with reference to the law of capture but that is al together a different matter Per Justice Chitty in In re Tootals Trusts 23 Ch D 532 540  Commercial domicil differs in so many respects from civil domicil that I do not think these cases useful in dealing with the present question Per Lord Justice Scrutton in Casdagli v Casdagli 87 L J P 79 89 440DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION what was called an AngloIndian domicill5 The doctrine is sum marized in The Laws of England as follows An exception to the ordinary rules governing the acquisi tion of a domicil of choice formerly existed in the case of British subjects in the service of the East India Company re siding in India for a period of service that was not fixed The government of the Company was regarded as a foreign government and entry into its service as imposing a duty which was incompatible with the retention of an existing domicil and a presumption which was not allowed to be rebutted was raised in favour of an intention consistent with this duty An Indian domicil was therefore acquired by mere residence in India under these conditions without regard to the actual state of mind accompanying it and in spite of the fact that the majority of the Companys servants definitely looked forward to their return This anomalous domicil has never been acquired by the servants of the Crown in India and since 1858 the mode in which an Indian domicil is ac quired has ceased to be exceptionall6 The domicil of British subjects not in the service of the East India Company who settled in India for the purpose of trade was not in frequently referred to as AngloIndianl7 and the distinction be tween the two kinds of cases was not always carefully observed The doctrine of AngloIndian domicil was admittedly anomalous It lost its practical importance after the establishment of direct British rule in India Curiously enough it has been invoked as a precedent in every case involving the question of domicil under consular juris diction Antipathy to the idea of Christian domicil in heathen countries and appeals to false analogies particularly to analogies with the rule as to commercial domicil and with the doctrine of AngloIndian domicil contributed to produce a somewhat unusual confusion The conception of domicil was distorted and the accumulated dicta of distinguished judges became the foundation for the anomalous rule laid down by the Court of Appeal in the Casdagli case The 15 See Bruce v Bruce 2 B  P 229 1790 Craigie v Lewin 3 Curt 435 1843 Forbes v Forbes 23 L J Ch 724 1854 Hepburn v Skirving 9 W R 764 i86i Jopp v Wood 34 L J Ch 212 I865

Ch 434 I864 441MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW first case in which the acquisition of a domicil of choice under con sular jurisdiction was considered was Maltass v Maltassl18  he testator was born and settled all his life at Smyrna His father had been domiciled at a remote period in England The will was valid under English law but it was contended that the testator had been domiciled in Turkey and that by Turkish law he could not dispose of his property by will Dr Lushington remarked at the outset that an inquiry as to domicil would be unnecessary if it should appear that with respect to this particular succession the law of England and the law of Turkey were the same and in concluding his opinion he said I wish to observe that I am desirous not to be supposed to have given an opinion upon any question not necessary to be decided in this case My judgment therefore does not affect the question of domicil If the deceased was in the legal sense domiciled in Turkey and if the law of domicil does prevail the law of Turkey in conformity with the treaty says that in such case the succession to personal estate shall be governed by the British law if he was not domiciled in Tur key but in England then the law of England prevails proprio zigore19 I give no opinion therefore whether a British subject can or cannot acquire a Turkish domicil but this I must say I think every presumption is against the intention of British Christian subjects voluntarily becoming domiciled in the do minions of the Porte As to British subjects originally Mus sulmen as in the East Indies or becoming Mussulmen the same reasoning does not apply to them as Lord Stowell has said does apply in cases of a total and entire difference of religion customs and habits20 8 Rob Eccl 67 1844 19 Westlakes punctuation of this paragraph has been followed in preference to the obviously defective punctuation of the report Westlake Private International Law 4 ed 318 20 Rob Eccl 67 80 In this enlightened age the doctrine of immiscibility cannot be accorded such weight as to establish a legal presumption against all other evidence tend ing to prove animus In American jurisprudence at least it should be allowed to slumber with Quaker persecution Salem witchcraft and other kindred dogmas Since the dictum of immiscibility was first declared the world has experienced a revolution touching the national commercial and trade relations between the nations of the East and those of the West Our conclusion therefore upon the first proposition is that no sound reason can be adduced against the practical application of the American law of domicil to Americans residing in China when the animus et factum are found to concur Per Justice Spear in Mather v Cunningham I05 Me 326 341 442DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION It is evident that Dr Lushingtons remark on the subject of domicil was dictum The question of domicil under consular jurisdiction was expressly left undecided The question might have been decided had it been properly sub mitted in the famous case of In re Tootals Trusts21 The testator was a British subject who had resided for a long period at Shanghai and had manifested an undisputed animus manendi The liability of his personal estate to the English legacy duty depended upon his domicil at death On the one hand an argument that the testator had acquired a Chinese domicil would encounter Dr Lushingtons dictum as to the presumption against an intention to acquire such a domicil22 On the other hand an argument that the testator had acquired an AngloChinese domicil could be supported by an analogy with the doctrine of AngloIndian domicil It is perhaps not sur prising although none the less unfortunate that counsel elected the latter alternative Counsel admitted that the testators domicil was not Chinese apparently meaning that he had not intended toi subject himself to the law applicable to Chinamen and contended that his domicil was AngloChinese apparently meaning that he was sub ject to the law which applied to Englishmen in China2s With regard to the admission of counsel Mr Justice Chitty said This admission was rightly made The difference between the religion laws manners and customs of the Chinese and of Englishmen is so great as to raise every presumption against such a domicil and brings the case within the prin ciples laid down by Lord Stowell in his celebrated judg ment in The Indian Chief and by Dr Lushington in Mal tass v Maltass24 It was held that the doctrine of AngloIndian domicil was inapplica ble2 that there was no such thing known to the law as AngloChi 2123 Ch D 532 1883 See Westlake Domicile at a Chinese Treaty Port in 9 Law Magazine and Review 4th series 363382 22 It would seem that the existence of exterritorial jurisdiction ought to make it eas ier to find the necessary animus for in selecting a new domicil of choice the fact that his affairs would be governed by the law of his own country would tend naturally to influence a person in favor of the new domicil See 58 Univ of Penn Law Review 543 548 8 The argument was summarized by Justice Chitty in the opinion as follows Upon these facts it is contended for the Petitioners that there exists at the foreign port of Shanghai an organised community of British subjects independent of Chinese law and exempt from Chinese jurisdiction and not amenable to the ordinary tribunals of this country but bound together by law which is English law no doubt but English law with this difference that the English revenue laws do not form part of it and that by residence and choice the testator became a member of this community and as such acquired an AngloChinese domicil 23 Ch D 532 536 a4 23 Ch D 532 534 25 At Shanghai there is a British consul residing there by virtue of the treaties but 443MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW nese domicil and that the testator must have retained his English domicil of origin In the course of his opinion Mr Justice Chitty said There is no authority that I am aware of in English law that an individual can become domiciled as a member of a community which is not the community possessing the su preme or sovereign territorial power26 When taken out of its context this remark has been the source of considerable embarrassment but considered in relation to the pre cise point which Mr Justice CIIITTY had to decide it seems to be free from difficulty In any event the question of the acquisition of domicil in China by a person enjoying consular protection was not squarely submitted to the court The most important question was eliminated by the admission of counsel and the court was asked and refused to find not a Chinese but an anomalous AngloChinese don icil analogous to AngloIndian domicil Tootals Trusts is at best a frail support for the decision of the Court of Appeal in Casdagli v Casdagli The authority of AbdulMessih v Chlukri Farra27 in which Mr Justice Chittys dictum was approved by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is still more dubious The testator in this case was born at Bagdad an Ottoman subject In early life he went to India where he remained for a considerable period Later he went to Jeddah and afterwards to Cairo where he lived for twentyseven years under the protection of the British Government On his death the question arose as to the law which should determine his power of testacy and the distribution of his effects It was argued that by making his permanent home in Cairo under British protection the testator had acquired an AngloEgyptian domicil or at least an Egyptian as distinguished from a Turkish domicil The latter point was not argued in the consular court however and was dismissed very briefly by the Judicial Committee on appeal The Judicial Committee found Tootals Trusts an authority directly in point and held that an Ottoman subject could not acquire an Anglo Egyptian domicil of choice by residing in Egypt then Ottoman ter ritory under British protection because domicil depends on locality and not on membership in a protected community Lord Watson there is no government by British authority existing there and there is nothing which can be regarded as a separate or independent Government and the analogy which the Pe titioners seek to establish with an AngloIndian domicil is not made out 23 Ch D 532 538 2 23 Ch D 532 538 See Westlake Private International Law 4 ed 318319 27 13 App Cas 431 I888 444DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION remarked that residence in a foreign country without subjection to its municipal laws and customs is therefore ineffectual to create a new domicil and also that residence in a foreign State as a privileged member of an ex territorial community although it may be effectual to destroy a residential domicil acquired elsewhere is ineffectual to cre ate a new domicil or choice28 The authority of Tootals Trusts on the point at issue in Abdul Messih v Chukri Farra has never been satisfactorily explained The two cases apparently had little in common The passages quoted from Lord Watsons opinion seem to have gone somewhat beyond the point to be decided The suggestion that residence under consular jurisdiction should be ineffectual to create a new domicil of choice was not favorably received among the jurists William Edward Hall regarded the law as settled by Tootals Trusts and AbdulMessih v Chukri Far ra but regretted that a change in the law had not been made by Order in Council It is perhaps to be regretted that a change in the law is not made which a short Order in Council could easily effect AngloOriental domicil has its reasonable it may almost be said its natural place Conflicts between the differing laws of England of Scotland of the various selfgoverning col onies are inevitable within British jurisdiction in the East but it is unnecessary to multiply the points of collision So long as persons have not identified themselves with the life of a new community they must each keep his own law but as soon as they have shown their wish and intention to cut themselves adrift from the association of birth they prove their indifference to the personal law attendant on their dom icil of origin there is therefore no reason why simplicity and unity of law should not be gained for British subjects by attributing community in the laws of England to all of European blood29 The late Professor Westlake regarded the whole question as un settled and thought that it called for further examination by the Iouse of Lords or the Privy Council30 Sir Francis Piggott whose 28 13 App Cas 431 439 445 The case was cited with approval although the point under consideration was not involved in Abdallah v Rickards 4 T L R 622 i888 29 Foreign Jurisdiction of the British Crown I80I86 I84  Private International Law 4 ed 311322 321 See also g Law Magazine and Review 4th series 363382 445MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW opinion is especially valuable because of his experience as Chief Justice of Hong Kong did not think that Tootals Trusts had pro moted a final solution of the problem and he expressed the opinion that when the question was again raised it would be found that the principles established by the most recent cases necessitate a recon sideration of the law laid down on this subject by Mr Justice Chitty31 A more recent study of the subject by Mr Charles H Huberich leads its author to the following conclusion The acquisition of a domicile in a country granting exter ritorial privileges is governed by the same principles of law as the acquisition of a domicile in other countries Where the requisite factumn and animus are shown to exist there is no valid reason why an Englishman or an American should not be held to acquire a domicile in China In respect of all matters which private international law refers to the law of the domicile he would be governed by the Chinese law the law of the territorial sovereign The law to which he would be subject would be none the less the law of China because it provides that persons of British and American nationality shall be governed by such laws as their respective countries may enact to goven their nationals in China32 The suggestion that a domicil of choice cannot be acquired under consular jurisdiction has been repudiated in the only American jurisdictions where the question has been raised In the case of In re Allens Will33 before the United States Court for China the tes tator was born in Georgia moved to China when twentyfour years of age and lived there for twentyseven years until his death en gaged in his labors as a missionary His family was reared in China and his estate consisting solely of personal property was accumu lated there He expressed an intention on several occasions to make China his permanent home but never abandoned his American citizenship It was held that the testator had acquired an extrater ritorial domicil34 in China and that the administration

August I907 printed in i American Journal of International Law 1029 34 The term extraterritorial domicil was unfortunate and has been criticized in the later American case We wish to say however that we do not agree with Judge Wilfley in employing the name extraterritorial domicil It appears to be inconsistent with the fundamental idea of domicil which as we have endeavored to show is a relation between an individual and a particular locality or country The fact that the law governing the 446DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION tate should be determined by the common law which Congress had authorized the United States Court for China to apply Judge Wil fley said We can see no good reason for holding that a citizen of the United States cannot be domiciled in China Mr Justice Chittys decision destroys in their application to China all the definitions of domicil contained in the books It ignores both of the essential elements of residence and intention    It requires a greater stretch of the imagination and the adop tion of a greater fiction of law to hold that a person can be domiciled in a country where he does not reside and has no intention of residing at any future time than to hold that a citizen of a foreign State can acquire an exterritorial domicil in a community which is not the community possessing the sovereign territorial power Every consideration of reason and convenience demands that the American law of domicil be applied by American Courts in China35 The same question was submitted to the Maine Supreme Court in Mather v Cunningham36 The testator was born in Waldo County Maine but lived most of his life at Shanghai His will was proved before the United States Consul at Shanghai Two brothers filed a petition in the Probate Court of Waldo County Maine for ad ministration of the estate as intestate property contending that the decedent could not acquire a domicil at Shanghai that he retained his domicil of origin and that by the law of Maine the will was in valid It was held that domicil under consular protection is to be determined by the same rules of law which control the acquisition of domicil elsewhere that the testator had acquired a Chinese domicil and that his will was properly sustained under the common law as administered by the American Consular Court In this state of the English and American authorities the precise question under consideration was squarely submitted to an English court for the first time it may be noted in the case of Casdagli v Casdagli37 Demetrius Casdagli was born in England in I872 of naturalized British parents Most of his life has been spent in Egypt where he has resided continuously since I895 and where he was married to a woman of Greek nationality in 90o5 In his will particular locality is extraterritorial does not make the domicil extraterritorial since it is immaterial upon the question of domicil from what source the law is proclaimed as before shown Mather v

subject having a domicil in Egypt Throughout his residence in Egypt Casdagli has been registered at the British consulate as a Britishborn subject The British Consular Court in Egypt has no jurisdiction to dissolve marriages In I916 Mrs Casdagli petitioned the English High Court for a divorce The Courts jurisdiction was denied on the ground that the respondent was not domiciled in Eng land and had never had a matrimonial domicil there It was answer ed that the respondent had never lost his English domicil of origin Casdaglis actual residence in Egypt and his aninmus man endi were established to the courts satisfaction Justice Horridge said In this case I think it is abundantly proved that the respondent has apart from extraterritorial rights voluntarily fixed his sole or chief residence in Egypt with the intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time38 The real issue of the case therefore was whether the possession by Casdagli as a British subject of ex territorial rights rendered him incapable of acquiring an Egyptian domicil Justice Horridge came somewhat reluctantly to the con clusion that he was bound by Tootals Trusts andAbdulMessih v Chukri Farra39 and held that Casdaglis residence and anialmus man endi in Egypt as a member of the exterritorial community were in effectual to create a new Egyptian domicil of choice This decision was affirmed by Swinfen Eady L J and Warrington L J in the Court of Appeal Scrutton L J dissenting40 The decision of the Court of Appeal in Casdagli v Casdagli appar ently rests upon the principle that domicil requires not only the fact of residence and the animus manendi but also what may be describ ed as a normal relation to the laws of the country of residence Of the case of Mather v Cunningham Swinfen Eady L J says This case is not consistent with the view of domicil adopted and acted upon by English Courts A person settling in a country where exterritorial 38 87 L J P 73 76 9 Justice Horridge said It may be that if this case had been presented to the Court free from authority I should have felt there was great force in the views expressed by certain jurists and in the American case on the matters dealt with in Tootals Trusts    and I might have come to a conclusion which having regard to Tootals Trusts   and AbdulMessih v Chukri Farra    would have been a wrong decision It may indeed be desirable at the present time that Britons retaining their position as British subjects should nevertheless be entitled to settle down in foreign territory and enter into the life and take part in the institutions of other countries and to subject themselves to the local laws of those countries which laws include regulations for their special protection I think however as the decision of Mr Justice Chitty which affects personal status is a decision given in 1883 and as it is supported by the great authority of the judgment of Lord Watson in the Privy Council I am bound to follow these cases and hold that the act on petition fails upon the third objection raised by the petitioner 87 L J P 73 78 4 87 L J P 79 448DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION privileges are granted and who is governed by the law of his domicil of origin cannot be said to have attracted to himself the local muni cipal law when the local law is by treaty expressly excluded from applying to him41 And Warrington L J declares that domicil in its legal meaning is clearly something more than the mere fact of physical residence coupled with the animus manendi It connotes also a legal relation to the laws of the country of residence by which questions relating to the personal status of the individual are de terlmined42 The notion that domicil requires actual residence the animus manendi and a normal relation to the laws of the country of resi dence involves in the opinion of the present writer an unnecessary confusion of domicil with lex domicilii Domicil is a legal relation ship between person and place43 Domicil of choice said Lord Westbury in Udny v Udny is a conclusion or inference which the law derives from the fact of a man fixing voluntarily his sole or chief residence in a particular place with an intention of continuing to reside there for an unlimited time44 The requisites for a dom icil of choice are i the fact of residence and 2 the animrts man endi The factum required is a change of residence voluntarily as sumed and permanent in character the animus required is an in tention to settle in a new country as a permanent residence45 It is plain said Justice Spear in Mather v Cunningham that it is the place not the local laws that becomes of paramount importance in determining the question of domicil Where not under what laws do the animus et factum concur46 The lex domicilii on the other hand is the law which is applied in the place of domicil Normally it is administered by the local authority but there is no reason why it may not come from a dual source and be administered partly by local and partly by exterritorial authority The conception of domicil and the lex domicilii ought never to be confused The distinction between them becomes especially im portant when dealing with a subject like domicil under consular jurisdiction where the character of the lex domicilii is somewhat ano malous The importance of the distinction is

of Lord Scrutton in the Casdagli case The first stage of the question seems to be Is there a domicil or permanent home which depends on the fact of residence and the intention to continue to reside The law of England generally determines the status of a person who may be contended to be subject to various laws which conflictas the lex domicilii the law of this national character the lex l ci actus or solutionisby the lex domicilii The second stage of the enquiry is Is there a lex domicilii which the English Courts will recognise   The law of the domicil would appear to be the law which the Sovereign of the domi cil would administer in the case of the domiciled person If so can it make any difference whether the Sovereign of the domicil administers the law directly or allows another Sov ereign by grant to exercise part of his sovereignty by admin istering such law as he pleases in Courts which the Sovereign of the domicil allows to exist in his territory The law ap pears still to be the law of the domicil allowed to be admin inistered in the country of the domicil by the sovereign power of that country whose consent is necessary for its adminis tration   As a matter of principle apart from authority I am unable to see why the fact that the Sovereign of a country has granted to another country the privilege of exercising jurisdiction over its subjects within his dominions according to its own law should prevent a subject of the latter country who resides and intends permanently to reside in the former country from acquiring a domicil there He will have a lex domziciliinamelv the law which the Sovereign of the coun try allows to be applied to him by the Courts which that Sov ereign allows to exist    Where the territory of residence belongs to a Sovereign who grants or allows a certain law to exist in it for certain persons I can see no reason in principle why there should not be a domicil and a lex domiicili47 If the confusion of domicil and lex domicilii is objectionable as it seems clearly enough to be then hyphenated descriptions of domicil under consular jurisdiction ought to be abandoned at once and for all The terms AngloChinese AngloTurkish etc have had their distinguished proponents Now it would seem convenient said 47 87 L J P 79 87 It is impossible to do justice to the dissenting opinion in the Casdagli case by quoting extracts It deserves to be read in extenso 450DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION the late Professor Westlake that the domicile in such a case should be denoted by a compound name of which one element should indi cate the territory and the other the community48 William Edward Hall defended the same nomenclature49 Compound names are practically inseparable however from a distorted conception of dom icil50 While they may be useful in describing the lex domicilii under consular jurisdiction it is submitted with all deference to the dis tinguished authority of Hall and Westlake that as applied to domicil they are at least misleading and superfluous The multiplication of technical terms is an evil only to be justified by necessity and dom icil is domicil from however many sources the lex donticilii may be derived The idea of a hyphenated domicil compounded of relation to locality and membership in a community was repudiated in Tootals Trusts51 Mr Justice Chittys dictum suggested another query how ever as to whether domicil can be acquired under what may be des cribed as a hyphenated lex domicilii Does the partition of jurisdic tion between the territorial and the exterritorial authorities in case of consular jurisdiction constitute an insuperable obstacle to the ac quisition of domicil It was intimated in Tootals Trusts and Abd ulMessih v Chukri Farra that such an obstacle inheres in the na ture of consular jurisdiction Mr Charles H Huberich has sug gested that the difficulty arose out of an erroneous conception of ex territoriality He believes that it is possible to regard the state which concedes exterritorial privileges as supreme over all persons and things within its territorial limits and to explain exterritorial jurisdiction as a mere delegation of authority He concludes The legislative power of China extends to all persons and things within the territorial limits of the Empire the British 489 Law Magazine and Review 4th series 363 372 See also his Private Interna tional Law 4 ed 3II322 4 Foreign Jurisdiction of the British Crown 184186 60 This is well illustrated by Halls defence of the notion of AngloOriental domicil He says Theoretically the conception of such a domicil is unobjectionable if once the mind is cleared of the notion at present dominant that domicil is the creature of place and intention alone In Europe it is so because residence in a place implies subjection to the common territorial law and to no other in the East it is not necessarily so be cause residence there implies subjection to the law of one or other of several different communities the personal laws of which receive equal recognition from the territorial sovereign power Association with place is necessary to domicil but it is not always the sole determinant factor In any case even if the conception of domicil here suggested be anomalous the convenience of giving effect to it is large enough to excuse a certain sacrifice of logical principle Op cit i86 61 Strictly speaking that was all that Tootals Trusts decided and on that point it is submitted that the decision was correct 451MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW Parliament in legislating for British nationals in China acts merely under a delegation of authority Such laws are op erative within the territory of China only because China rec ognizes them as part of the law of the land The Chinese law subjects certain persons owing allegiance to a foreign govern ment to rules of law which may differ from those that are applied to persons of Chinese nationality just as the common law subjects certain transactions having their origin in for eign countries to rules of law which may differ from those that are applied to transactions taking place in the forum Nor is the principle affected by the circumstance that this law is administered by officials appointed by a foreign gov ernment52 In other words the partition of jurisdiction which seems to have troubled the English courts does not really exist This explanation appears to have been approved in Mather v Cunningham where it was said The ownership of the soil therefore controls the estab lishment of all local laws Without consent of the owner no extraterritorial law can be enacted within an independent jurisdiction or extended to it China is independent It never released its ownership to the soil of Shanghai Its sovereignty over its territory was retained    whatever laws may have been extended by Congress to the Province of Shanghai are operative not upon American soil but upon the territory of the Chinese Empire How do these laws reach there By treaty permission of the Emperor  Although the Emperor had suspended some of the Chinese laws and permitted the extension of American law to the territory yet the source of the law was the Emperor who had never released his sovereignty over the soil53 The above explanation was in no way essential to the decision in Mather v Cunningham however for the decision was based upon the principle that domicil is independent of any distinction with respect to the source of the lex domicilii Consular jurisdiction was not explained as a mere delegation of authority in the American case of Allens Will54 The English 3 24 Law Quarterly Review 440 448 Compare Westlake 9 Law Magazine and Review 4th series 368 63 05 Me 326 337 338 The opinion is not as clear on this point however as the extracts quoted above might seem to indicate Judge Wilfley said while the Emperor of China exercises nominal sovereignty over 452DOMICIL UNDER CONSULAR JURISDICTION cases have insisted throughout that the concession of exterritorial privileges involves a real partition of jurisdiction55 The most recent expression on this point is found in the Casdagli case where it was said It is not by reason of any local law that a British protected person in Egypt is to be immune from local law and that his own law is to be applied to him by His Britannic Majes tys Courts sitting in Egypt on Egyptian soil but deriving their authority from His Majesty such jurisdiction is indeed in derogation of the power of the Sovereign of the country conferring such rights    and the law administered in Egypt by His Britannic Majestys Courts is English law and not Egyptian local law56    With all respect to the American judges who in Mather v Cuznni gham    expressed a con trary view I am of opinion that the Consular Court in Egypt is one of the Kings Courts that its jurisdiction is de rived from the King and not from the Ruler of Egypt and that the law administered therein is strictly the law of Eng land and is not to be regarded as a branch of the law of Egypt57 It would seem that the English courts are abundantly justified itn insisting that the law stick to realities The theory of delegated au thority is false to the facts Moreover it is superfluous The diffi culty has not arisen out of an erroneous conception of consular juris diction It has arisen out of a distorted idea of domicil which it has been suggested seems to have had its inception in a confusion of domicil with lex domicilii Let the importance of preserving a clear distinction between domicil and the lex domicilii be fully understood all Chinese territory including that occupied by the nationals of the United States and Great Britain yet the jurisdiction of these two countries over their own citizens who reside in China is for all practical purposes as full and complete as if China were in fact territory belonging to these nations I American Journal of International Law 1029 I034 55 In Tootals Trusts Justice Chitty said The sovereignty over the soil at Shanghai remains vested in the Emperor of China with this exception that he has by treaty bound himself to permit British subjects to reside at the place for purposes of commerce only without interference on his part and to permit the British Crown to exercise jurisdiction there over its own subjects but over no other persons 23 Ch D 532 539 See also Papayanni v The Russian Steam Navigation and Trading Company 2 Moore P C N S x6I 1863 Imperial Japanese Government v The Peninsular and

admitting the possibility of domi cil under consular protection The lex domicili will have a dual source but that is a phenomenon by no means entirely unknown to the law Something of the sort exists in case of federations con federations and loosely constituted empires In international re lationships phenomena that are similar in some respects at least result from military occupation prolonged intervention protection financial supervision of debtor states the administration of terri tory the leasing of territory and divers limitations of the nature of servitudes There is no reason why a partition of jurisdiction which involves a lex domicilii derived from a dual source should be re garded as an insuperable obstacle to the acquisition of domicil The English conception of consular jurisdiction is sound enough but the English rule which denies the possibility of acquiring a domicil of choice under consular jurisdiction is at once illogical and impractical Its consequences have never been sufficiently consider ed A British subject cannot acquire a domicil of choice abroad un der consular protection He cannot have a matrimonial domicil un der consular protection A fortiori his children born under ex territorial jurisdiction can have no domicil of origin at their place of birth And so on for as many generations as one chooses to postu late This is not mere idle speculation for there are many British families which have been settled for several generations under British consular jurisdiction Domicil in such cases must be domi cil of some ancestor The manifold inconveniences necessarily in cident to the application of the doctrine of ancestral domicil are too obvious for comment58 Although residence and the animus manen di in an exterritorial community cannot destroy a domicil of origin they must from the very circumstances of the case destroy a pre vious domicil of choice since the conditions under which that domi cil arose have been terminated Having destroyed a previous domi cil of choice they operate to revive a preexisting domicil of origin although there is ex hypothesi no animus revertendi to that domicil In other words we have what Sir Francis Piggott has aptly described as a mechanical contrivance for supplying a want of definite in tention applied to a case where there are definite intention and every ingredient and every idea involved in the assumption of a new domicil59 It has been suggested that there may be other jurisdictional anom alies in which the lex domicilii is derived from a dual source If the 8s See Hall

merits and with more or less disregard for the an cient doctrine of immiscibility the analogies with commercial and AngloIndian domicil and the accumulated dicta of distinguished judges A generation

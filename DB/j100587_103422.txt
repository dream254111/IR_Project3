SAME TRANSLATED BY JOHN CHAMBERLAYNE ESQ DELFT IN HOLLAND 27 JUNE 1721 I HAVE OFTEN TURND MY THOUGHTS TO THE OBSER VING THE SO CALLED MEMBRANES IN WHICH THE SUB STANCE OF MEAL OR FLOWER IS INCLOSED LIKE LITTLE PACK ETS IN CELLS OR BOXES WHICH IS ALSO THE CASE OF ALL KINDS OF BEANS PEASE WHEAT BARLEY AND OTHER GRAIN I AT LENGTH WITH ASTONISHMENT DISCOVERD VERY PLAINLY THAT WHAT I CALL THE MEMBRANES WERE ENDU ED WITH AN UNSPEAKABLE NUMBER OF LITTLE HOLES THRO WHICH IN MANY PLACES ONE MIGHT PERCEIVE THE LIGHT WHICH HOLES WE MUST SUPPOSE TO BE NOTHING ELSE BUT LITTLE VESSELS WHICH HAD BEEN TORN OR CUT OFF AND WHICH DO PARTLY COMPOSE THE MEMBRANES WHICH I CALL LITTLE CELLS AND WHICH PARTLY SERVE FOR THE PRO DUCTION OF THE FARINA OF WHICH THERE ARE AN INFINITE NUMBER OF PARTICLES IN A PEA OR BEAN WHICH AS SMALL AS THEY ARE I IMAGINE THAT EACH OF THOSE MEA LY PARTICLES RECEIVES ITS INCREASE FROM A LITTLE VESSEL WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE FORESAID CELL AND THAT THOSE VESSELS ARE IMPERCEPTIBLE THROUGH THEIR SMALL NESS THESE VESSELS OF WHICH THE LITTLE CELLS OR CASES DO MOSTLY CONSIST ARE MORE EASY TO BE DISCOVERD IN BEANS AND PEASE THAN IN ANY SORT OF LEGUMENS OR GRAINS BUT IN WHEAT THE VESSELS ARE DIFFICULTLY TRA CED201 CED IN THE CELLS AND I HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE VERY MANY OBSERVATIONS AND EXPERIMENTS BEFORE I COULD FULLY SATISFY MY SELF THAT I SAW THE TORN OR BROKEN VESSELS THE REASON OF WHICH IS THAT THE LIT TLE VESSELS OF WHICH THE CELLS OR SKINS OF THE GRAINS OF WHEAT ARE COMPOSED ARE EXCEEDING THIN AND BRITTLE MOREOVER I HAVE FOUND UPON OBSERVING THE VES SELS OF WHICH THE CELLS ARE COMPOSED THAT SEVERAL OF THE GLOBULES IN WHEAT WERE BROKEN IN PIECES IN THE OPERATION AND THAT IN ONE OF THOSE SINGLE GLOBU LES THERE WERE OTHER SMALL GLOBULES ENCLOSED I HAVE LIKEWISE OBSERVED THAT THE MEMBRANES OR LITTLE CELLS IN BARLEY IN WHICH THE GLOBULES OR PARCELS OF THE MEAL ARE SHUT UP AND RECEIVE THEIR INCREASE ARE THICKER AND STRONGER THAN THOSE OF WHEAT ALTHOUGH I CONCLUDE THAT ALMOST ALL SEEDS AND GRAINS AS WELL AS THEIR MEMBRANES OR SKINS ARE OF ONE AND THE SAME TEXTURE AND CONFIGURATION YET FOR EXPERIMENT SAKE I TOOK A LARGE ALMOND AND CUT OFF SEVERAL THIN SLICES FROM IT AND DUG OUT OF THOSE SLI CES AS WELL AS I COULD THE SUBSTANCE THAT LAY IN THE LITTLE CELLS AND VIEWING THEM AS NICELY AS POSSIBLE WITH A MICROSCOPE I OBSERVED THAT THOSE CELLS IN WHICH THE OYL OF THE SAID ALMOND WAS FOR THE MOST PART CONTAIND CONSISTED ALSO OF NOTHING BUT LITTLE VESSELS MY INTENTIONS WERE INDEED IF IT HAD BEEN PRACTI CABLE TO VIEW THE SMALLER SORTS OF SEEDS IN ORDER TO FIND OUT WHETHER THE LITTLE CELLS IN WHICH THE FA RINACEOUS MATTER MIGHT LIE WERE LIKEWISE COMPOSED OF SMALL VESSELS BUT I CHANGED MY MIND BELIEVING F F THAT202 THAT MY ENDEAVOURS THEREIN WOULD BE INEFFECTUAL BY REASON OF THE SMALLNESS OF THOSE LITTLE CELLS AND CON SEQUENTLY OF THE VESSELS OF WHICH THOSE CELLS WERE MADE UP THOUGH I DO NOT QUESTION BUT WHAT WE DIS COVER IN THE GREATER SEEDS IS ANALOGOUS TO THE STRUC TURE OF THE SMALL ONES NOW WHEN I PERCEIVD THAT THE BEFOREMENTIOND LITTLE CELLS PROCEEDED FROM THE BARK OR SKIN WHICH SURROUNDS THE KERNEL OF THE SEED OR GRAIN I WAS THINKING THAT AS THE MEALY SUBSTANCE RECEIVES ITS IN CREASE FROM THE VESSELS WHICH ARE IN THE LITTLE CELLS AND AS THE PLANT IS FORMED BETWEEN THE CELLS DU RING THE TIME THAT THE SEED LIES IN THE EARTH AND AS THE LITTLE ORIFICES IN THE SKIN OF ANIMALS AND FRUITS ARE FORMED IN ORDER TO DISCHARGE THEREBY THE SUPER FLUITY OF THEIR MOISTURE AND DO SHUT IN SUCH A MAN NER THAT NO MOISTURE NOR COMMON AIR CAN GET INTO THE SAME AS I HAVE FORMERLY ADVANCED SO ON THE CONTRARY THE ORIFICES OF SEEDS ARE SO FORMD THAT MANY OF THEIR LITTLE VESSELS DO ADMIT MOISTURE TO PASS INWARDS AND ACCORDINGLY WATER IS DRIVEN INTO THEM BY THE PRESSURE OF THE AIR AND CAUSES THE SEED TO SWELL UPON WHICH A WARMTH AND FERMENTATION SUC CEEDING IN THE SEED IT REQUIRES A GREATER SPACE AND BY THE PARTICULAR FORMATION OF THE PARTICLES WHICH LIE IN THE CELLS AND WHICH HAVE DERIVED THEIR EN CREASE FROM THE CELLS THE MEALY SUBSTANCE OF WHICH THEY CONSIST IS PARTLY DRIVEN OUT OF THEM INTO THE BODY OF THE YOUNG PLANT WHICH BY THIS MEANS EN CREASES SO MUCH IN BULK THAT THE ROOT IS NOW ABLE TO SUPPLY IT WITH NOURISHMENT FROM THE EARTH AT WHICH TIME THE SEED IS FOUND TO BE DIMINISHED IN ITS BIG NESS AS203 AS OFTEN AS I HAVE VIEWD SEEDS FOR SEVERAL YEARS PAST WITH THE MICROSCOPE YET I NEVER IMAGIND THAT THE LITTLE CELLS WERE ENDUED WITH SO MANY VESSELS THO I HAVE OFTEN BEEN CONSIDERING HOW THE INTRUSION OF THE PARTICLES OF THE MEALOR FLOWERINTO THE MEM BRANES WAS EFFECTED NOR SHOULD I EVER HAVE ATTAINED THERETO BUT BY CONTINUAL LABOUR IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THINGS WHICH ARE CONCEALED FROM OUR NAKED EYES AND TOWARDS WHICH I HAVE A MUCH GREATER INCLINATION THAN WHAT I OBSERVE IN MOST OTHER MEN F F 2 IX EXTRACT

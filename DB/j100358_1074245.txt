J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074245,THE EDUCATION OF A NATURALIST,I244473,THE SCHOOL REVIEW MAN MAY SUCCEED IN THE UNITED STATES IF HE DOES BEGIN HIS PROFESSIONAL WORK AS LATE AS TWENTYFIVE YEARS OF AGE C H THURBER THE EDUCATION OF A NATURALIST IN THE EARLY DAYS OF SCIENCE WHEN THERE WAS A GOOD DEAL OF UNCLAIMED AND UNCULTIVATED GROUND LYING ABOUT MEN SOME TIMES DROPPED INTO SCIENCE BY THE MEREST CHANCE SOME OF THEM WITH BUT LITTLE PREPARAEION FOR THE WORK AND MANY OF THEM WITH LESS NOWADAYS WE HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT AND YET AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED THERE ARE STILL PLENTY OF PERSONS OF INTELLI GENCE WHO HAVE NO CONCEPTION WHATEVER OF THE DUTIES OF A SCIENTIFIC MAN THOSE WHO IMAGINE THAT SCIENCE AS A PROFESSION CAN BE PICKED UP JUST AS THE DUTIES OF CERTAIN CIVIL OFFICES OR OF CLERICAL POSITIONS MAY BE READILY LEARNED AND PERFORMED BY ANY MAN OF ORDINARY INTELLIGENCE AMONG THE APPLICATIONS 1 HAVE RECEIVED FOR EMPLOYMENT UPON GEOLOGICAL SURVEYS UNDER MY DIRECTION ONE MAN GAVE AS A REASON WHY HE SHOULD BE EMPLOYED THAT HE WAS A GRADUATE OF WEST POINT ANOTHER WAS INTERESTED IN GEOLOGY AND HAD READ MANY BOOKS UPON THE SUB JECT AMONG WHICH HE CITED SOME OF THE VAPORINGS OF IGNATIUS DONNELLY ANOTHER USED TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH PROFESSOR WINCHELL AND ANOTHER WAS IN POOR HEALTH AND THOUGHT FIELD WORK WOULD BE GOOD FOR HIM  AND STILL ANOTHER WAS A CONSISTENT MEMBER OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH AT LEAST HALF OF THE AP PLICANTS HAVE ASKED FOR EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD ORDINARY LAND SURVEYING AND ONE OF THEM ADMITTED THAT HE HAD NO OTHER QUALIFICATION THAN THAT HE WAS A GOOD HAND TO CAMP OUT BUT THIS DROPPING INTO SCIENCE OF SUCH MEN IS NO LONGER POSSIBLE AND WE NOW REALIZE THAT THOSE WHO ARE TO DO THE SCIENTIFIC WORK OF TODAY AND OF THE FUTURE MUST BE THOROUGHLY GROUNDED IN THEIR COLLEGE TRAINING OR ITS EQUIVALENT AND THEY MUST BRING TO THEIR WORK THE BEST AND BROADEST SCHOLARSHIP AND THE MOST THOROUGH SPECIAL TRAINING COMMENCEMENT ADDRESS LELAND STANFORD TUNIOR UNIVERSITY I347H EDUCATION OF A NATURALIST OF CERTAIN SUBJECTS THAT THE NATURALIST MUST STUDY IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO MAKE MENTION FOR HE WHO EXPECTS TO BE A BOTANIST WILL OF COURSE STUDY THE BIOLOGICAL BRANCHES THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO A THOROUGH COMPREHENSION OF BOTANY THOSE THINGS HOWEVER WILL ALWAYS TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THE MORE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS THAT ARISE IN THE MINDS OF STUDENTS RELATE CHIEFLY TO STUDIES AND OTHER MATTERS THAT LIE WITHOUT HIS SPECIAL LINE OF WORK THE GENERAL TRAINING OF A SCIENTIFIC MAN DURING THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF HIS COLLEGE COURSE IS NOT OR SHOULD NOT BE ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF ANY MAN OF CULTURE IN THE BALANCING OF THE ESSENTIALS AND NONESSENTIALS CERTAIN ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS HAVE ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION TO BE FACED AT THE VERY OUTSET THOSE OF US WHO DEVOTE OURSELVES TO PURE SCIENCE ARE CONSTANTLY BEING WEARIED WITH THAT MOST TIRE SOME OF ALL PHILISTINE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF WHAT A MAN READS ABOUT THINKS ABOUT OR DOES HOW THIS AND THAT STUDY THIS AND THAT BIT OF TRAINING ARE GOING TO BE OF ANY USETHE WHOLE INTELLECTUAL AND CULTURAL BEARING OF AN EDUCATION BEING COMPLETELY IGNORED AS MEN WHO LOVE SCIENCE FOR ITS OWN SAKE WE GET WEARY OF SUCH QUESTIONS AND SOME OF US FEEL DRIVEN IN ORDER TO EMPHASIZE OUR WARNINGS TO AVOID THE USEFUL ALTOGETHER THUS WE OCCASIONALLY HAVE ON THE ONE HAND MEN WHO HAVE A HORROR OF DOING ANYTHING OF PRACTICAL VALUE AND ON THE OTHER MEN WHO HAVE NO PATIENCE WITH AN INVESTIGATION WHICH DOES NOT PROMISE SOME MATERIAL REWARD MY OPINION IS IS THAT THERE IS LITTLE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN IN THESE TWO TYPES ONE OF THEM IS JUST AS FAR WRONG AS THE OTHER PURE SCIENCE HAS ITS PLACE AND ITS WORK SO HAS APPLIED SCIENCE AND EACH IN ITS PLACE IS IMPORTANT AND INDISPENSABLE WHETHER ONE DEVOTES HIMSELF TO PURE OR APPLIED SCIENCE SHOULD BE DECIDED BY ONES TASTE AND FITNESS AS FAR AS POSSIBLE OF ONE THING HOWEVER BE ASSURED WITHOUT PURE SCIENCE THERE CAN BE NO APPLIED SCIENCE AND IF ANYONE HOPES TO BE COME EMINENT IN EITHER BRANCH HE MUST FIRST LAY HOLD ON SCIENCE ITSELF 135THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE GREAT ADVANCEMENT THE PHYSICAL COMFORTS AND CONVEN IENCESWHAT IS GENERALLY COMPREHENDED UNDER THE WORD PROG RESSOF TODAY HAS NOT SPRUNG FULL GROWN FROM THE BRAIN OF APPLIED SCIENCE AS SO MANY PEOPLE SEEM TO THINK SUCH PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE POSSIBLE ONLY BY THE ABSTRUSE AND AP PARENTLY AIMLESS AND USELESS GENERALIZATIONS OF PURE SCIENCE SPEAKING OF MEN WHO DEVOTE THEMSELVES TO SUCH WORK MR HOLLY SAYS THESE MEN DO NOT INDEED CREATE THE LAWS OF NATURE AS THEY SOMETIMES ALMOST SEEM TO BUT THEY GO UP INTO THE TREMBLING MOUNTAIN AND THE THICK DARKNESS AND BRING DOWN THE TABLES UPON WHICH THEY ARE WRITTEN BUT WHATEVER WE STUDY AND WHATEVER WE DO IN SCIENCE THERE IS TO BE DONE IN IT AN IMMENSE AMOUNT OF WHAT ENGINEERS KNOW AS I DEAD WORK THAT IS WORK THAT IS QUITE INDISPENSA BLE WORK THAT DOESNT SHOW TO ADVANTAGE SO FAR AS MERE DIS PLAY IS CONCERNED BUT WITHOUT WHICH THE WHOLE SUPERSTRUCTURE WOULD BE LIABLE TO GO TO PIECES ALL SCIENTIFIC EDUCATION AND ALL SCIENTIFIC WORK IS BASED OR SHOULD BE BASED ON A SINGLE DOGMATHE ONLY DOGMA THAT SCIENCE RECOGNIZESAND THAT IS THAT TRUTH IS BETTER THAN FALSE HOOD IN ITS PROFESSIONAL BEARING THE MOST ESSENTIAL PART OF THE TRAINING OF A MAN OF SCIENCE SHOULD BE TO THE END THAT HE OB SERVE WELL AND THAT IN HIS DEDUCTIONS HE PROPERLY SUBORDINATE HIS FACTS HIS PRELIMINARY TECHNICAL TRAINING SHOULD THEREFORE BE FOR THE PURPOSE OF TEACHING HIM ACCURACY AND DETAIL  AND THE NECESSITY OF ACCURACY SHOULD BE SO DEEPLY IMPRESSED UPON HIS MIND THAT ACCURACY WILL BECOME A PART OF HIS NATURE AS THE WHOLE PROFESSIONAL TRAINING OF THE NATURALIST IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENABLING HIM TO REACH CORRECT CONCLUSIONS HE SHOULD BE TRAINED IN THE USE OF EVERY METHOD OF INVESTIGATION THAT WILL AID HIM AND AMONG THESE METHODS I COUNT AS OF GREAT IMPORT ANCE THAT OF MULTIPLE WORKING HYPOTHESES IN MY OWN EXPERI ENCE I HAVE FOUND IT OF THE GREATEST VALUE AND I KNOW OF NO BETTER WAY OF DEVELOPING THE REASONING POWERS OROF ANTICIPAT ING DIFFICULTIES OR OF REACHING RIGHT CONCLUSIONS THAN BY THE 136THE EDDUCATION OF A NATURALIST PROPER USE OF HYPOTHESES I LAY SOME STRESS UPON THIS POINT BECAUSE I FIND THAT THERE ARE THOSE WHO THINK THAT A MAN OF SCIENCE CAN HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH HYPOTHESES THAT HE MUST CONFINE HIMSELF TO FACTS THEORY IS JUST AS IMPORTANT IN SCIENCE AS FACT THOUGH PERFORMING VERY DIFFERENT FUNCTIONS THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THE YOUNG NATURALIST MUST LEARN AND IT IS WELL FOR HIM AND FOR THE WORLD IF HE LEARN THEM JUST AS EARLY IN HIS CAREER AS POSSIBLE TO SOME OF THESE I WOULD CALL HIS ATTENTION IN HIS METHODS HE MUST ALWAYS BE WILLING TO PROFIT BY THE EXPERIENCES OF OTHERS METHODS AND APPLIANCES OF RESEARCH ARE CONSTANTLY BEING IMPROVED BUT THE IMPROVEMENTS ARE MADE NOT BY DISREGARDING THE EXPERIENCE OF OTHERS BUT BY MAKING EVERY POSSIBLE USE OF IT THE NEWLY FLEDGED SOMETIMES BEGIN WITH THE IDEA THAT THE WORLD WAS NOT DISCOVERED UNTIL THEY DISCOVERED IT AND THEY THINK IT PERFECTLY SAFE TO DISCARD ALL HUMAN EXPERIENCE THIS IS ONE OF THE SIGNS OF A MORAL DISEASE VULGARLY KNOWN AS THE  BIGHEAD WHEN A SCIENTIFIC MAN GETS IT HE NEVER RECOVERS IN TIME TO BE OF ANY SERVICE TO MANKIND I WOULD NOT HAVE A YOUNG MAN DOUBT HIS OWN ABILITY CONFI DENCE IN ONES SELF IF IT BE WELL PLACED IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN SUCCESS BUT IT DOESNT FOLLOW THAT WHEN ONE TRUSTS HIMSELF HE SHOULD MISTRUST ALL THE REST OF THE WORLD WE HOPE AND BE LIEVE THAT THE YOUNG MAN OF TODAY IS WISER AND BETTER EQUIPPED THAN THE YOUNG MAN OF ANY PAST GENERATION  BUT THE DIFFERENCE IS AFTER ALL NOT GREAT AND IT IS QUITE SAFE TO PRESUME THAT ONES ANCESTORS DID KNOW A FEW THINGS WORTH KNOWING THE NECESSITY OF CAUTION ON THE PART OF THE YOUNG MAN IN SCIENCE IN PUBLISHING CONCLUSIONS THAT ONE FEELS TO BE OPEN TO CRITICISM OR WHEN HE SEES THAT IMPORTANT FACTS MAY HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKED CANNOT BE TOO STRONGLY EMPHASIZED THE PUBLICA TION OF FACTS IS GENERALLY USEFUL BUT DEDUCTIONS CAN AFFORD TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE PROPERLY MATURED A MOST VALUABLE PIECE OF ADVICE ONCE GIVEN ME WAS TO THE EFFECT THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WOULD BETTER NOT BEGIN PUMPING OUT OF THEIR INTELLECTUAL RESER I37LHE SCHOOL REVIEW VOIRS BEFORE SOMETHING HAS BEEN PUMPED INTO THEM LIFE IS TOO SHORT AND PROGRESS IS TOO SLOW FOR US TO CUMBER THE MARCH OF SCIENCE WITH VERBOSE DISCUSSIONS WHICH HELP TOWARD STRIFE AND CONTENTION INSTEAD OF TOWARD TRUTH AND UNION THE LONGER ANYONE STUDIES A VAST SUBJECT THE MORE CAUTIOUS IN INFERENCE DOES HE BECOME TO BE SURE IGNORANCE IS NO REASON WITH A FOOL FOR HOLDING HIS TONGUE BUT MY ADVICE IS NOT IN TENDED FOR FOOLS WHO WILL BE FOOLS IN SPITE OF EVERYBODY AND EVERYTHING BUT FOR THOSE WHO HAVING SOUND SENSE DESIRE NOT TO BRING DISCREDIT UPON THEMSELVES OR UPON THE SCIENCE TO WHICH THEY ARE DEVOTED SCIENCE IS NOT INFREQUENTLY CHARGED WITH VACILLATION AP PROPOS OF THIS SOME ONE REMARKS SCIENCE SAYSBUT NO MAT TER WHAT SCIENCE SAYS FOR THE NEXT TIME SHE SAYS ANYTHING SHELL SAY JUST THE OPPOSITE WE CANNOT DENY THE JUSTNESS OF THE IMPLIED CRITICISM BUT THAT IT IS JUST MUST BE ATTRIBUTED ENTIRE LY TO PREMATURE UTTERANCES WE HAVE SOME SAD EXAMPLES OF SCIENTIFIC MEN WHOSE PREMATURE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM TOO HASTY OR INCOMPLETE WORK HAVE KEPT HALF A DOZEN GOOD MEN BUSY FOR YEARS IN CORRECTING THEIR MISTAKES AND IN PUTTING THE TRUTH BEFORE THE WORLD THEY ARE USUALLY MEN OF GOOD ENOUGH INTENTIONS BUT  WE HAVE A RIGHT TO EXPECT SOMETHING MORE THAN GOOD INTENTIONS OF MEN ALL PEOPLE MEAN WELL IT IS OUR BUSI NESS TO DO WELL SENSATIONALISM IS ANOTHER THING THAT HAS DONE AND WILL PROBA BLY CONTINUE TO DO GREAT INJURY TO ALL BRANCHES OF SCIENCE THERE ARE CERTAIN FEATURES ABOUT EVERY SCIENCE THAT IMPRESS THE UNIN FORMED WITH THEIR NOVELTY AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PERSONS WHO ARE ALWAYS READY TO MAKE CAPITAL OUT OF THEM THIS GIVES RISE TO A SORT OF O MY   CLASS OF MEN AND TO AN O MY  KIND OF SCIENCE SUCH PEOPLE DELIGHT IN THE STARTLING NONE OF THE MORE RADICAL THEORIES OF SCIENCE THEORIES PUT FORTH BY THE RIGHT THINKING WITH GREAT CAUTION STAGGER THEM IN THE SCIENTIFIC MANS TRAINING THE LESS WE HAVE OF THE SENSATIONAL THE BETTER IT WILL BE FOR SCIENCE AND FOR THE MAN THOSE WHO ARE AT ONCE WORKERS IN SCIENCE AND TEACHERS OF 138THF EDUCATION OF A NATURALIST SCIENCE KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT SOMETIMES IS TO DRAW A SHARP LINE BETWEEN WHAT WE KNOW AND WHAT WE SIMPLY BELIEVE  BUT SO FAR AS POSSIBLE THIS DISTINCTION SHOULD ALWAYS BE KEPT BEFORE THE MINDS OF STUDENTS AND NO EFFORT SHOULD BE SPARED TO PRE VENT THAT DAZING OF THEIR MINDS WHICH PREVENTS THEM FROM WEIGHING EVIDENCE AND FROM DISTINGUIGHING BETWEEN SIMPLE TRUTH LEGITIMATE HYPOTHESES AND SIMPLE FIGMENTS OF THE IMAGINATION AND NOW JUST A WORD ABOUT OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO OUR OWN INTELLECTS INTELLECT IS THE TOOL WITH WHICH THE MAN OF SCI ENCE HAS TO DO HIS WORK IF THAT TOOL IS BENT OUT OF SHAPE OR DULLED BY IMPROPER USE IT CANNOT PERFORM ITS FUNCTIONS PROP ERLY IT IS HIGHLY ESSENTIAL THEREFORE THAT HE KEEP HIS INTEL LECT UNIMPAIRED HE SHOULD STRIVE TO KEEP HIS MIND FREE FROM THOSE TRICKS OF LOGIC RHETORIC AND SENTIMENT BY WHICH SO MANY OF US ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE IMPOSED UPON WE ARE BOUND BY EVERY SENTIMENT OF HONESTY TO GO WHERE OUR EVIDENCE LEADS US WHETHER IT TAKES US TO A PLEASANT PLACE OR NOT TRUTH MUST BE OUR COMPANION WHETHER SHE BE AN AGREEABLE OR A DIS AGREEABLE ONEA HANDSOME OR AN UGLY ONE WE CAN NOT HON ESTLY SAY TO REASON ITHUS FAR SHALT THOU GO BUT NO FARTHER  WE CANT REASONABLY FOLLOW SCIENCE TO CERTAIN POINT AND THEN ABANDON IT FOR THE DIVINING ROD OR SPIRITUALISTIC SEANCES OR CLAP TRAP APPLIANCES OF ANY KIND THE MAN WHO HAS NO NOTION OF ACCEPTING THE RESULTS OF HIS REASONING WOULD JUST AS WELL NOT REASON AT ALL WHILE HE WHO UNDERTAKES TO REASON WITHIN CER TAIN LIMITS INSULTS HIS INTELLIGENCE ABOVE ALL LET ME CAUTION YOUNG NATURALISTS AGAINST WHAT I MAY CALL THE DEBATING SOCIETY STYLE OF REASONING THE DE BATING SOCIETY IS CALCULATED TO INCREASE ONES INTELLECTUAL AGILITY NO DOUBT BUT AS ITS OBJECT IS THE TRAINING OF ADVOCATES ITS IN FLUENCE ON A MAN OF SCIENCE IS HARMFUL TO THE LAST DEGREE FOR A SCIENTIFIC MAN MUST BE A JUDGENOT AN ADVOCATE I TAKE IT THAT IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY TO SPEAK HERE OF THE NECES SITY OF ONES INTERESTING HIMSELF IN A SPECIALTY IF HE WISHES TO ACCOMPLISH MUCH IN THE WAY OF ORIGINAL WORK NOWADAYS IN I39THE SCHOOL REVIEW SAYING A WORD FOR SPECIALTIES I AM FULLY AWARE OF ALL THAT HAS BEEN URGED AGAINST THIS KIND OF SCHOLARSHIP THE PRESIDENT OF ONE OF OUR GREATEST EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SAID TO ME A FEW YEARS AGO THAT HE HAD HIS DOUBTS AND FEARS ABOUT THE OUTCOME OF THIS MODERN TENDENCY AMONG SCIENTIFIC MEN TO SPECIALIZATION SAID HE IF THIS THING GOES ON WE SHALL HAVE AFTER A WHILE A MAN WHO WILL KNOW ALL ABOUT THE STRIPES ON A TRILOBITES TAIL BUT HE WONT KNOW ANYTHING ELSE IT IS VERY EASY TO RIDICULE A SPECIALIST IF THE AIMS OF HIS STUDIES ARE NOT COMPREHENDED GALVANI STUDYING THE TWITCHING OF A FROGS LEGS DARWIN BREED ING PIGEONS AND AGASSIZ PLANTING STICKS ON A GLACIER ARE IN SPIRING OR RIDICULOUS IN PROPORTION AS WE COMPREHEND THE BEAR ING OR END OF THEIR STUDIES WHETHER STUDYING THE TWITCHING OF A FROGS LEGS OR THE STRIPES ON A TRILOBITES TAIL IS AN UNWORTHY AND CONTEMPTIBLE OCCUPATION FOR AN INTELLIGENT MAN DEPENDS THEREFORE UPON THE MOTIVE AND THE ULTIMATE OBJECTS OF THE STUDY AND IN REGARD TO SPECIAL WORK BY THOSE WHO ASPIRE TO BROAD CULTURE IN SCIENCE I CAN ONLY SAY THAT A MAN WHO IS IN CAPABLE OF DOING AND HAS NOT DONE SPECIAL INVESTIGATION IS NOT CAPABLE OF TAKING A BROAD VIEW OF SCIENCE IN ANY OF ITS RELATIONS MR DARWIN HAS DONE SOME OF THE BEST GENERALIZING OF OUR AGE BUT BEFORE HE DID IT HE HAD DONE SOME OF THE BEST OF SPECIALIZ ING AND THAT TOO ON SUCH UNPRACTICAL UNINTERESTING AND USE LESS ANIMALS AS THE BARNACLES THE NECESSITY OF SPECIALTIES HAS SPRUNG FROM A NECESSITY OF A DIVISION OF LABOR IN SCIENCE JUST AS MANUAL SKILL COMES FROM A DIVISION OF LABOR IN THE ARTS PROGRESS DEPENDS ON SUCH DIVIS ION BUT WHILE WE MUST CONFINE OURSELVES TO SPECIALTIES CARE SHOULD BE TAKEN NOT UNNECESSARILY TO DIMINISH THE FIELD OF OUR OBSERVATIONS THERE IS A TENDENCY ON THE PART OF A CERTAIN CLASS OF SPECIALISTS TO PUT EVERYTHING UNDER THE MICROSCOPE THIS IS AN EXCELLENT WAY OF SEEING SOME THINGS BUT IT IS AS DIFFICULT TO EXAMINE A LANDSCAPE WITH A MICROSCOPE AS IT IS TO EXAMINE BACTERIA WITHOUT ONE MANY QUESTIONS IN SCIENCE CAN BE STUDIED SATISFACTORILY ONLY WHEN WE TAKE A BROAD VIEW OF 140THE EDUCATION OF A NVATURALIST THEM AND SOME DISCRETION MUST BE USED IN THE APPLICATION OF METHODS INQUIRIES ARE OFTEN ADDRESSED TO COLLEGE PROFESSORS AS TO WHAT A STUDENT SHOULD TAKE UP AS A SPECIALTY THIS IS A MATTER ABOUT WHICH ONE WHO IS NOT FLIPPANT IS SLOW TO GIVE ADVICE THERE ARE SOME GENERAL TRUTHS HOWEVER THAT ARE APPLICABLE TO ALL CASES FIRST YOU SHOULD NOT MISTAKE YOUR AMBITION FOR YOUR NAT URAL CALLING IT DOESNT FOLLOW BECAUSE YOU WOULD LIKE TO BE A DARWIN THAT YOU ARE CUT OUT FOR ONE SECOND YOU MUST NOT IMAGINE BECAUSE YOU LOVE NATURE THAT YOU WERE BORN FOR A NATURALIST THIS KIND OF A MISTAKE IS OFTEN MADE BY YOUNG PEOPLE IT IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE MAN WHO STUDIES PLANTS IS NECESSARILY IN LOVE WITH PLANTS OR THAT THE ENTOMOLOGIST IS NEC ESSARILY IN LOVE WITH INSECTS THE LOVER OF NATURE IS A POET WHOSE FANCY ENDOWS NATURES BARE FACTS WITH ATTRIBUTES THAT THE NATURALIST AS SUCH KNOWS NOTHING ABOUT ONE SOMETIMES HEARS IT SAID THAT WORDSWORTH AND LOWELL WOULD HAVE MADE GOOD NATURALISTS I DOUBT IT WHAT THEY SAY OF BIRDS AND TREES AND FLOWERS AND SUNSHINE AND SNOW ARE CERTAINLY NO EVIDENCE OF IT THE METHODS OF THE MAN OF SCIENCE DEAL NOT WITH THE BEAUTIES OF NATURE AS BEAUTIES BUT WITH THE FACTS AND LAWS DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT OUR GREAT ICHTHYOLOGIST IS IN LOVE WITH FISHES NOT AT ALL HIS INTEREST IN FISHES IS AN INTEREST IN NATURAL LAW THE NATURALIST IS A CLASSI FIER AND ONE MUST BE GUIDED IN CHOOSING NATURAL HISTORY AS A PROFESSION BY THE TASTE AND FITNESS FOR CLASSIFICATION AND FOR NATURES PROBLEMS RATHER THAN BY ONES ADMIRATION FOR THE BEAUTIES OF THE FLOWERS OR THE SONGS OF THE BIRDS BESIDES TO BE A SUCCESSFUL MAN OF SCIENCE ONE MUST GO INTO SCIENCE VERY LARGELY BECAUSE HE CANT HELP ITBECAUSE HE CANT KEEP OUT OF IT I MEAN OF COURSE THAT THE PARTICULAR BRANCH OF SCIENCE HE ENTERS MUST SO FILL THE DEMANDS OF HIS MIND HIS TEMPERAMENT AND HIS TASTES THAT IN ANY OTHER OCCUPATION HE 14I142 7HE SCHOOL REVIEZE FEELS THAT HE IS NOT WHERE HE CAN MAKE THE MOST OF HIMSELF AND OF HIS ENERGIES SUCH MEN WILL HAVE THAT PROFESSIONAL PRIDE ZEAL AND AMBITION WITHOUT WHICH EVERYONE IS DOOMED TO A FATAL MEDIOCRITY THIS POINT WAS WELL ILLUSTRATED IN THE EX PERIENCE OF ONE OF THE PROMINENT GEOLOGISTS OF THIS COUNTRY THE STORY OF HOW HE FOUND HIS REAL CALLING WAS THUS TOLD ME A SHORT TIME AGO BY HIS FATHER SAID HE EDWARD STUDIED CIVIL ENGINEERING AND DID MORE OR LESS WORK AT IT AND WE HAD SETTLED IT IN OUR MINDS THAT HE WAS TO BE AN ENGINEER BUT I NOTICED THAT ALTHOUGH HE DID GOOD WORK AND RATHER ENJOYED IT HE DIDNT GO OUT WITH THE ENGINEERS EVERY TIME HE HAD A CHANCE AND IF HE HAPPENED TO WANT TO GO WITH THEM IT DIDNT TAKE MUCH TO DIVERT HIS ATTENTION FROM THEIR WORK HE NEVER OFFERED TO CARRY STAKES OR A CHAIN JUST FOR THE SAKE OF BEING WHERE ENGINEERING WAS GOING ON THEN HE TOOK A FANCY FOR MECHANICS AND STUDIED THAT DILIGENTLY FOR TWO OR THREE YEARS AND WORKED IN THE SHOPS UNTIL HE BECAME PRETTY SKILLFUL AND THEN WE SETTLED IT IN OUR MINDS THAT EDWARD WAS GOING TO BE A MECHANICAL ENGINEER BUT SAID THE FATHER AFTER ALL I HAD MY DOUBTS ABOUT IT  I NOTICED THAT WHILE HE WAS AGOOD MECHANIC WE NEVER HAD TO DRAG HIM AWAY FROM HIS WORK HE WAS ALWAYS ON TIME AT HIS MEALS AND HE WENT TO AND CAME FROM HIS WORK AS IF IT WERE ALL A MERE MATTER OF DUTY FINALLY HE TOOK TO GEOLOGY AND THEN HE LOST HIS WHOLE HEART DAYS WERE TOO SHORT AND NIGHTS TOO LONG HOLIDAYS HE NO LONGER KNEW  EATING AND SLEEPING BECAME DISAGREEABLE NE CESSITIES SOCIAL DUTIES AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAN HIS BELOVED SCIENCE WERE PUT OFF TILL A MORE CONVENIENT SEASON IT IS HARDLY NECESSARY FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THAT YOUNG MAN MADE A GEOLO GIST OF WHOM WE ARE ALL PROUD AND THIS CASE IS NO EXCEPTION INDEED IT IS QUITE A TYPICAL ONE THERE IS THUS GOING ON A PROCESS OF NATURAL SELECTION THAT PUTS EVERY MAN IN HIS PLACETHAT IS WHERE HE CAN BEST SERVE THE WORLD AND SUCH A PROCESS MAKES IT THE MORE NECESSARY THAT YOUNG PEOPLE SHOULD MAKE NO MISTAKES IN THE CHOICE OF A CALL ING OR IN THE PREPARATION FOR ITROMAN EDUCATIOI AND NOW I WANT TO SAY A WORD ABOUT A PART OF THE NATURAL ISTS EDUCATION THAT IS NOT COMPREHENDEDIN HIS DIRECTLY PREPAR ATORY STUDIES  AT LEAST NOT AS PREPARATORY STUDIES NOW GO IN THIS COUNTRY OR IN THE ETHICAL RELATIONS OF HIS PROFESSIONAL WORK THOUGH I BELIEVE IN SPECIALTIES I AM NOT DISPOSED TO SIDE WITH THOSE WHO THINK THAT IF A MAN IS TO BE A SPECIALIST THE SOONER HE BEGINS HIS SPECIALTY THE BETTER IN A GENERAL WAY THIS PROPOSITION IS CORRECT BUT IN MAKING SUCH AN ADMISSION IT MUST BE DISTINCTLY UNDERSTOOD THAT ALL THINGS WHICH TEND TO BROADEN A MANS SCHOLARSHIP FORM ESSENTIAL PARTS OF HIS SPECIAL TY FOR WHILE I BELIEVE MOST HEARTILY IN SPECIALIZATION I BE LIEVE NONE THE LESS HEARTILY IN A GENERAL EDUCATION FOR THE MAN OF SCIENCE THERE HAS BEEN A DISPOSITION OF LATE TO RUSH TO THE OTHER EXTREME LARGELY BECAUSE THE OLDFASHIONED CLASSICAL EDU CATION HAS ON THE WHOLE BEEN SO UNSATISFACTORY ONE SHOULD CERTAINLY HAVE MORE THAN A SINGLE WINDOW IN THE INTELLECTUAL HOUSE IN WHICH HE MUST PASS HIS LIFE SPECIALIZE YES BY ALL MEANS SPECIALIZE BUT APART FROM YOUR SPECIALTY SEE THAT YOUR INTELLIGENCE IS PROPERLY CULTIVATED ON AS MANY SIDES AS POSSIBLE GROW UPNOT LIKE A TELEGRAPH POLE USEFUL BUT BARE AND UGLYBUT LIKE A WELL PROPORTIONED TREE WITH BRANCHES ON ALL SIDES TO GATHER INTO YOUR LIFE THE FRESH AIR AND THE SUNSHINE

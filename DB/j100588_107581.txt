J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107581,OBSERVATIONS ON THE ANALOGY WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS,I206972,C 197 J XIV OBSERVATIONS ON THE ANALOGY WHICH SUBSISTS BETWEEN THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS BY CHARLES BABBAGE ESQ M A F R S READ APRIL 17 187 IT IS MY INTENTION IN THE FOLLOWING PAPER TO OFFER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY SOME REMARKS ON THE UTILITY OF ANALOGICAL REA SONING IN MATHEMATICAL SUBJECTS AND TO ILLUSTRATE THEM BY SOME STRIKING FACTS WHICH HAVE OCCURRED TO ME WHEN COM PARING THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS WITH OTHER MODES OF CALCULA TION WITH WHICH MATHEMATICIANS HAVE BEEN LONG ACQUAINTED THE EMPLOYMENT OF SUCH AN INSTRUMENT MAY PERHAPS CREATE SURPRISE IN THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO VIEW THIS SCI ENCE AS ONE WHICH IS FOUNDED ON THE MOST PERFECT DEMONSTRA TION AND IT MAY BE IMAGINED THAT THE VAGUENESS AND ERRORS WHICH ANALOGY WHEN UNSKILFULLY EMPLOYED HAS SOMETIMES INTRODUCED INTO OTHER SCIENCES WOULD BE TRANSFERRED TO THIS IT IS HOWEVER ONLY AS A GUIDE TO POINT OUT THE ROAD TO DISCOVERY THAT ANALOGY SHOULD BE USED AND FOR THIS PURPOSE IT IS ADMIRABLY ADAPTED IT IS USUALLY MORE DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER THAN TO DEMONSTRATE ANY PROPOSITION FOR THE LATTER PROCESS WE MAY HAVE RULES BUT FOR THE FORMER WE HAVE NONE THE TRACES OF THOSE IDEAS WHICH IN THE MIND OF THE DISCOVERER OF ANY NEW TRUTH CON NECT THE UNKNOWN WITH THE KNOWN ARE SO FAINT AND HIS ATTEN TION IS SO MUCH MORE INTENSELY DIRECTED TO THE OBJECT THAN TO198 MR BABBAGE ON THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE THE MEANS BY WHICH HE ATTAINS IT THAT IT NOT UNFREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT WHILE WRE ADMIRE THE HAPPINESS OF A DISCOVERY WE ARE TOTALLY AT A LOSS TO CONCEIVE THE STEPS BY WHICH ITS AUTHOR ASCENDED TO IT FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS I THINK IT WILL APPEAR THAT ANY SUCCESSFUL ATTEMPT TO EMBODY INTO LANGUAGE THOSE FLEETING LAWS BY WHICH THE GENIUS OF THE INVENTOR IS INSENSIBLY GUIDED IN THE EXERCISE OF THE MOST SPLENDID PRIVILEGE OF INTELLECT WOULD CONTRIBUTE MORE TO THE FUTURE PROGRESS OF MATHEMA TICAL SCIENCE THAN ANY THING WHICH HAS HITHERTO BEEN ACCOM PLISHED AMIDST THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF ALL ATTEMPTS OF THIS KIND THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATIONS OF ONE OF THE MOST OBVIOUS ASSISTANTS OF THE INVENTIVE FACULTY WILL NOT I HOPE BE CONSI DERED USELESS EVEN THOUGH IT SHOULD HAVE NO OTHER EFFECT THAN THAT OF DIRECTING THE ATTENTION OF THOSE WHO ARE ENGAGED IN MATHEMATICAL ENQUIRIES TO THIS MOST INTERESTING AND IMPOR TANT SUBJECT AT OUR FIRST ENTRANCE INTO ALGEBRA ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH PRESENTS ITSELF IS THAT SOME FRACTIONS WHICH IN CERTAIN CASES APPARENTLY VANISH HAVE IN FACT A FINITE VALUE SUCH IS THE FRACTION ABX WHICH WHEN X O BECOMES I IAND YET ITS REAL VALUE IS WELL KNOWN TO BE LOG BIL HERE THEN BY ASSIGNING A CERTAIN VALUE TO A VARIABLE QUAN TITY WHICH IS CAPABLE OF ALL DEGREES OF MAGNITUDE THE EXPRES SION APPARENTLY BECOMES ILLUSORY LET US NOW EXAMINE A PARALLEL CASE IN THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS TAKE THE EXPRES SN 4X SION AND LETUS SUPPOSE L TO BE AN ARBITRARY CHARACCALCULUS OFFUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS 199 TERISTIC CAPABLE OF ASSUMING

CIRCUMSTANCE OF THIS SPECIES OF VANISHING FRACTIONS HAVING AN ARBITRARY FUNCTION CONTAINED IN THEIR TRUE CALUE IS OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE IN THE CALCULUS OF FUNC TIONS AS I SHALL NOW SHORTLY ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE THE ROYAL SOCIETY DID ME THE HIONOUR TO INSERT IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS A PAPER OF MINE IN WHICH I GAVE A NEW METHOD OF SOLVING ALL FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS OF THE FIRST ORDER AND OF A CERTAIN CLASS BY MEANS OF ELIMINATION AND I THERE STATED THAT ALL SOLUTIONS SO OBTAINED WERE ONLY PAR TICULAR CASES OF THE GENERAL SOLUTIONS AND THAT THEY DID NOT CONTAIN ANY ARBITRARY FUNCTION NOW IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN FORMS WHICH MAY BE ASSIGNED TO THE COEFFICIENTS WHICH RENDER THOSE SOLU TIONS APPARENTLY INFINITE YET THAT ON FARTHER CONSIDERATION IT APPEARS THAT THE SOLUTION IS IN FACT A VANISHING FRACTION IN ALL SUCH CASES THE PROCESS I HAVE JUST POINTED OUT WILL GIVE THE REAL SOLUTION V HICH WILL CONTAIN AN ARBITRARY FUNCTION SO THAT IT IS IN FACT A GENERAL SOLUTION THUS IN THE EQUATION 4 ID JVE20Q MR BABBAGE ON THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE FCFX FX AX FR WHOSE SOLUTION IS X  IF IFF FAX  I IT APPARENTLY BECOMES INFINITE BUT BY SUBTRACTING THE EQUATION

APPARENTLY FAILS THE REAL VAIUE OF THE VANISHING FRACTION WILL GIVE THE GENERAL SOLUTION OF THE EQUA TION THIS PRINCIPLE PUTS US IN POSSESSION OF THE GENERAL SOLUTIONS OF SEVERAL CLASSES OF EQUATIONS FOR BESIDES THE CASESCALCULUS OFFUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS 203 IN WHICH THE SOLUTIONS VANISH FROM SOME PARTICULAR VALUES OF THE COEFFICIENTS ALL EQUATIONS WHICH ARE HOMOGENEOUS RELATIVE TO THE DIFERENTFORMS OF THE UNKNOWN FINCTION ARE COMPREHENDED IN IT AS ARE ALSO ALL EQUATIONS WHICH ARE SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO THE SAME QUANTITIES THERE EXISTS ANOTHER CLASS OF EQUATIONS NEARLY ALLIED TO THOSE WHICH ARE SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE UNKNOWN FUNCTIONS WHOSE SOLUTION I SHALL NOW POINT OUT CHIEFLY WITH THE VIEW OF GIVING ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF A METHOD OF REASONING WHICH MAY FREQUENTLY BE EMPLOYED WITH ADVAN TAGE IN THESE INQUIRIES AND ALSO FOR THE PURPOSE OF MENTION ING A REMARK RESPECTING THE ELIMINATION OF VARIABLES IN A CER TAIN CLASS OF ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS WHICH I DO NOT RECOLLECT TO HAVE SEEN NOTICED THE CLASS OF FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS TO WHICH I ALLUDE ARE CONTAINED IN THE EXPRESSION F A AX   AD ID IDAX   A T  O WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF

SUBSTITUTION OF AX 6X  A XN X FOR X AND SINCE THE FORM OF THE UNKNOWN FUNCTION DEPENDS ON THAT OF THOSE WHICH ARE KNOWN IT FOLLOWS THAT THE FORM OF THE UNKNOWN FUNCTION WILL NOT BE CHANGED BY THE SUBSTITUTION OF AX 2   EX FOR X OR IN OTHER WORDS WE MAY SUPPOSE 4AX   X C 4 IANAS AND CONSEQUENTLY AX WILL BE DE TERMINED BY THE EQUATION F TJGX A  TXFVXFXJ C O24 Q MR BABBAGE ON HE ANLOGY BETWEEN THE OR FROK FAK AX X  AD MVF ABXY AI   IF THERE SHOULD EXIST ANY DOUBT RESPECTING THE ACCURACY OF THIS REASONLING IT MAY BE CONFIRMED BY ARRIVING AT THE SAME CONCLUSION IN RATHER A DIFFERENT MANNER IF IN THE GIVEN EQUATION WE SUBSTITUTE SUCCESSIVELY X MY X ANIX FOR X WE SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING EQUATIONS FEM  R 4 AH A  FL J N  F X OXA CF C FA IWLX   XZ X M O  NXZ TO ELIMINATE AP D C FROM THESE N EQUATIONS WOULD IN MOST CASES BE EXCESSIVELY TROUBLESOME IT MAY HOWEVER BE OBSERVED THAT 4IX OCCURS IN THE SECOND EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER THAT AX OCCURS IN THE FIRST ALSO 4OZ IS CON TAINED IN THE THIRD IN THE SAME MANNER AS 4XC IS CONTAINED IN THE FIRST AND SIMILARLY WITH THE REST FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT THOUGH NO ONE OF THE EQUATIONS IS SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO 4A A  4AN  YET WHEN ALL THE EQUATIONS ARE CONSI DERED TOGETHER THEY ARE SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO 4 4X X JWLYIX FROM THIS IT FOLLOWS THAT WHETHER WE FIND BY ELIMI 1ATION 4 X 4A  OR AFLX THE RESULT WRILL BE THE SAME THEREFORE 4 X C  A IX AND WE MAY DETERMINE T FROM THE EQUATION IT DOES NOT FOLLOW FROM HENCE THAT THIS EQUATION CONTAINS ALL THE VALUES OF 4 ON THE CONTRARY IF THE ELIMINATION BE TWEEN THE N EQUATIONS ABOVE WRITTEN WERE ACTUALLY PERFORMED IT WOULD BE FOUND THAT THE EQUATION A WOULD ENTER INTO THE FINAL RESULT AS ONE OF ITS FACTORSCALCULUS OFFUNCTIONS AND OTHER B RANCHES OF ANALYSIS IF WE APPLY THIS REASONING TO ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS CONTAINING SEVERAL VARIABLES AS FOR INSTANCE TO THE TWO EQUATIONS FXYABO FY ABO WE SHALL FIND THAT ONE SET OF THE VALUE OF X IS ALWAYS CON TAINED IN THE EQUATION F X X A B  O AS AN EXAMPLE LET US TAKE THE TWO EQUATIONS Y XA AND Z2YA ONE SET OF THE VALUES OF X ARE CONTAINED IN THE EQUATION X4 XA  O AND THIS ENTERS AS A FACTOR IN THE RESULT OF ELIMINATION WHICH GIVES ANOTHER CURIOUS ANALOGY EXISTS BETWEEN THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND COMMON ALGEBRA IN THE SIMILARITY OF THE RELA TIONS OF THE ROOTS OF UNITY TO THE SOLUTIONS OF THE FUNCTIONAL EQUATION 41AXX IN THE EQUATION REM  IT IS KNOWN THAT IF R BE ONE OF THE ROOTS THEN ANY POVWER OF R WILL ALSO BE A ROOT AND IF N IS A PRIME NUMBER AND R ANY ROOT EXCEPT UNITY THEN RAR R3  RNT WILL BE ALL THE DIFFERENT ROOTS SIMILARLY IN THE FUNCTIONAL EQUATION ADZX  IF AX BE ONE FORM WHICH SATISFIES IT CAMX WILL ALSO FULFILL IT AND IF N IS A PRIME NUMBER THEN AX X WILL ALL BE DIFFERENT FORMS WHICH SATISFY THE EQUATION THIS MAY BE READILY SHOWXN AS FOLLOWS IF AX IS A SOLUTION THEN  OF N A A SUPPOSE M  X THEN M X N XMNXAD XEXX CONSEQUENTLY ADX IS ALSO A SOLUTION OF 4L  X2O6 MR BABBAGE ON THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE AAIN AMM N X AN XN  AN AN M X AN A2HN   M1  Z C  SXZT SENG CONSEQUENTLY WHENEVER M IS A WHOLE NUMBER ATMX IS A SOLU TION OF 4IX  X IF WE TAKE THE PARTICULAR CASE OF N  3 WE HAVE 4X  X AND A  IS ONE OF ITS SOLUTIONS THEREFORE OTHER SOLUTIONS WILL BE AX I AX X1 A3X THESE EXPRESSIONS WHEN GENERALISED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ARBITRARY FUNCTION DO NOT GIVE SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE IRRE DUCIBLE TO EACH OTHER NOR DO THEY EVEN THEN IN MY OPINION CONTAIN ALL POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS BY INTRODUCING AN ARBITRARY FUNCTION THEY BECOME 9 9 1G AND P V THE LATTER OF WHICH GIVES I IF WE MAKE PX IF WE CONSIDER THE EQUATION 4X  O ONE OF ITS VALUES IS AX 3X THIS GIVES FOR THE OTHERS 3X3 2  2ZX3 3 6 4 X3 I3 6 A J  3 A   A X X X2X3 ALL THESE FORMS WILL SATISFY THE EQUATION 4X  X AND THEY MAY ALL BE GENERALISED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF AN ARBITRARY FUNCTION SIMILAR TO THAT EMPLOYED FOR THE EQUATION T1X  BUT I DO NOT SUPPOSE THESE SOLUTIONS WHEN THUS GENERALISED WOULD CONTAIN ALL POSSIBLE ONES PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS MAY THROW SOME LIGHT ON THE GENERALITY OF THE SOLUTIONS OF SUCH EQUATIONS AS THOSE WE ARE NOW CONSIDERING IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS OBVIOUS THAT EVERY SOLUTION OF 4AXXCALCUBIS OFFUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS 207 HWI1 ALSO BE A SOLUTION OF 4PX  X SUCH LIKEWISE WILL BE ALL THE SOLUTIONS OF 49 R  X THE COMPLETE SOLUTION OF PX  SHOULD THEREFORE CONTAIN ALL FORMS OF X WHICH SATISFY THE EQUATIONS 43X X AND GX  AGAIN IF A FUNCTION AS AX SATISFIES THE EQUATION A4JX AX IT WILL ALSO SATISFY XX FOR SINCE A3X  X BY PUTTING AX3X FOR X IT BECOMES A0X 3  3X X X SO ALSO ANY FUNCTION WHICH SATISFIES THE EQUATION 43X A WILL FULFIL THE EQUATION 1XX WHICH MAY X BE PROVED IN THE SAME MANNER I SHALL HOWEVER TAKE THE MORE GENERAL CASE AND SHOW THAT IF ANY FUNCTION SATISFIES THE EQUATION 4AXAX WHERE N IS ANY FUNCTION SATISFYING THE EQUA TION 2XX IT WILL ALSO SATISFY THE EQUATION AA FOR SINCE A3GX PUTTING OAS FOR X WE HAVE 3 3 13X IN THE SAME WAY IT MIGHT BE DEMONSTRATED THAT

METHOD OF TREATING THE SAME WHEN THEY ARE VARIABLE  BOTH THE PROCESSES ALLUDED TO DEPEND IN THE FIRST INSTANCE ON REDUCING THE EQUATION TO THE SOLUTION OF THE SAME EQUATION WANTING THE LAST TERM AND THIS IS EFFECTED BY MEANS OF A PARTICULAR INTEGRAL OF THE GIVEN EQUATION THE SOLUTION OF THE FUNCTIONAL EQUATION IS PRECISELY SIMILAR IT IS FIRST REDUCED TO THE SOLUTION OF O  X  A4 BYXC N4ANMX X XX X

RELATES TO PARTIAL DIFERENTIALS IS TOO APPARENT TO REQUIRE ILLUSTRATION I SHALL THEREFORE PROCEED TO SHOW THAT A FUNCTIONAL EQUATION ADMITS OF THREE SPECIES OF SOLUTIONS IST THE COMPLETE SOLUTION THIS CONTAINS AS MANY ARBITRARY FINCTIONS AS THE NATURE OF THE GIVEN EQUATION WILL ADMNIT 2DL THE PARTICULAR CASE THIS CONTAINS ALL SOLUTIOR1S WHICH ARE LESS GENERAL THAN THE COMPLETE SOLUTION AND WHICH ARE OULY PARTICULAR CASES OF IT IF THEY CONTAIN ARBITRARY FUNCTIONS I HAVE CALLED THEM FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE GENERAL SOLUTIONS ACID THE PARTICULAR SOLU TION THIS IS A SOLUTION WHICH SATI FES THE EQUATION AND MAY OR MAY NOT CONTAIN ARBITRARY FUNCTIONS  ITS PECULIARPROPERTY IS THAT IT IS FOUNDFROM ONE PART ONLY OF THE EQUATION AND INDEPENDEAT OF THE REST THUS IF WE HLAVE THE EQUATION  SY FFY

CONTAINED IN THE GIVEN FUNCTION F AND F PROVIDED ONLY THAT IT DOES NOT MAKE EITHER OF THEMI INFINITE WHETHER IT IS CONTAINED IN THE COMPLETE SOLUTION I HAVE NOT YET ASCERTAINED  BUT I AM RATHER OF OPINION THAT IT WILL BE FOUND NOT TO BE IN CLUDED IN IT IN BOTH PARTS OF MY ESSAY TOWARDS THE CALCU LUS OF FUNCTIONS I HAVE USED THE EXPRESSION PARTICULAR SOLU TION INSTEAD OF PARTICULAR CASE THIS AROSE FROM NOT HAVING TAKEN A SUFFICIENTLV EXTENSIVE VIEW OF THE CALCULUS IT WOULDCALCULUS OFFINCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS 211 PERHAPS BE DESIRABLE TO CONFINE THE MEANING OF PARTICULAR SOLU TION TO THE DEFINITION WHICH HAS JUST BEEN GIVEN IT IS NEED LESS TO ADD THAT THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF SOLUTIONS JUST ENUME RATED BEAR A STRONG RESEMBLANCE TO THOSE OF DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS AMONGST DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS CONTAINING MORE THAN TWO INDEPENDENT VARIABLES A LARGE PROPORTION DO NOT ADMIT OF ANY INTEGRALS THESE CAN ONLY BE INTEGRATED BY ASSIGNING SOME RELATION BETWEEN THE VARIABLES AN ANALOGOUS CASE OCCURS WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS A LARGE NUMBER OF THOSE WHICH CONTAIN TWO OR MORE VARIABLES ADMIT OF NO SOLUTION UNLESS WE ASSIGN SOME RELATION BETWEEN THE VARIABLE QUANTITIES EXAMPLES OF SUCH EQUATIONS MAY BE FOUND IN THE SECOND PART OF THE ESSAY TOWARDS THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS AND HERE PERHAPS IT MAY NOT BE MISPLACED TO STATE A DIFFICULTY OF A PECULIAR NATURE WITH RESPECT TO FUNCTIONAL EQUATIONS WHICH ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SAKE OF PERSPICUITY I SHALL CONSIDER A VERY SIMPLE CASE FOR X SUBSTITUTE I 44 C X AND BY MULTIPLICATION AX X J CG 4 X X OR I C0 FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWS THAT C   1 OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE EQUATION X  C4  IS CONTRADICTORY UNLESS C   I NOW THE FUNCTIONAL EQUATION F X X AX O HAS BEEN RE DUCED BY LAPLACE BY MEANS OF A VERY ELEGANT ARTIFICE TO AN EQUATION OF FINITE DIFFERENCES NOR AM I AWARE THAT THIS PROFOUND ANALYST HAS POINTED OUT ANY RESTRICTION OR ANY212 1 MR BABBAGE ON THE ANALOGY BETWEEN THE IMPOSSIBLE CASE IF WE TREAT

I  LOGE X WE HAVE OX C LOGN FOR THE SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION AX  CA I WHATEVER MAY BE THE VALUE OF C AND WE HAVE BEFORE SHOWN THAT IT CANNOT HAVE A SOLUTION UNLESS C   I THE ONLY EXPLANATION I AM AT PRE SENT ABLE TO OFFER CONCERNING THIS CONTRADICTION IS ONE WHICH I HINTED AT ON A FORMER OCCASION VIZ THAT IF WE SUPPOSE 4 TO REPRESENT ANY INVERSE OPERATION WHICH ADMITS OF SEVERAL VALUES THEN IF THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE EQUATION WE ALWAYS TAKE THE SAME ROOT OR THE SAME INDIVIDUAL VALUE OF 4 IT IS IM POSSIBLE TO SATISFY THE EQUATION BUT IF WE TAKE ONE VALUE OF A IN ONE PART AND ANOTHER OF THE VALUES OF 4 IN OTHER PARTS OF THE EQUATION IT IS POSSIBLE TO FULFIL IT BY SUCH MEANS THIS SOLUTION MAY PERHAPS APPEAR UNSATISFACTORY IT IS HOWEVER ONLY PROPOSED AS ONE WHICH DESERVES EXAMINATION AND I SHALL BE HAPPY IF ITS INSUFFICIENCY SHALL INDUCE ANY OTHER PERSON TO EXPLAIN MORE CLEARLY A VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT ONE OF THE MOST EXTENSIVE METHODS OF INTEGRATING DIFFEREN TIAL EQUATIONS CONSISTS IN MULTIPLYING BY SUCH A FACTOR ASWILL RENDER THE WHOLE EQUATION A COMPLETE DIFFERENTIAL THE DETER MINATION OF THIS FACTOR IS HOWEVER GENERALLY A MATTER OF AT LEAST EQUAL DIFFICULTY WITH THAT OF SOLVING THE ORIGINAL EQUA TION ANALOGY WOULD LEAD US TO SUSPECT THAT SOME SIMILAR MODE MIGHT BE ADOPTED FOR THE SOLUTION OF FUNCTIONAL EQUACALCULUS OFFUNCTIONS AND OTHER BRANCHES OF ANALYSIS 2X8 TIONS VARYING OF COURSE IN A CERTAIN DEGREE FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF THE OBJECTS TO BE OBTAINED  THE THEORY WHICH I AM NOW TO EXPLAIN WILL SHOW THAT THIS SUSPICION IS NOT WITHOUT FOUNDA TION AND WVILL AT THE SAME TIME UNFOLD ONE OF THE MOST BEAU TIFUL PARALLELS BETWEEN THE INTEGRAL AND FUNCTIONAL CALCULUS WHICH I HAVE YET OBSERVED IT HAS BEEN ALREADY SHOWN THAT WHEN AN EQUATION IS SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE UNKNOWN FUNCTION AS F X 4X A Z   THE METHOD OF SOLUTION BY ELIMINATION APPARENTLY BECOMES ILLUSORY BUT THAT THE GENERAL SOLUTION OF THE EQUATION MAY BE DEDUCED FROM THE VANISHING FRACTION TO WHICH THIS METHOD THEN LEADS IF THEREFORE WE CAN MAKE ANY FUNCTIONAL EQUA TION SYMMETRICAL RELATIVE TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF THE UNKNOWN FUNCTIONS WE CAN THEN OBTAIN ITS GENERAL SOLU TION NOWX THIS MAY BE EFFECTED BY MULTIPLYING THE EQUATION BY SOME FACTOR AND DETERMINING THIS FACTOR SO THAT THE RESULT SHALL BE SYMMETRICAL THE DISCOVERY OF THIS FACTOR AS IN THE CASE OF A DIFFERENTIAL EQUATION REQUIRES THE SOLUTION OF A FUNCTIONAL EQUATION OF SEVERAL VARIABLES BUT FORTUNATELY THE CLASS OF EQUATIONS TO WHICH THEY BELONG ARE NOT OF VERY GREAT DIFFICULTY TO BEGIN WITH A VERY SIMPLE CASE LET US CONSIDER THE EQUAL TION AX  FX  FX WHERE MZX I MULTIPLYING BY PX WE HAVE QX A  AT A FX A P X NOW THE FIRST SIDE OF THIS EQUATION WILL BE SYMMETRICAL RELA TIVE TO 4 AND 4ZX IF

SYMMETRICAL AND ITS GENERAL SOLUTION MAY THEREFORE BE FOUND IT MUST HOWEVER BE OBSERVED THAT ALL THE SOLUTIONS OF THIS LATTER EQUATION ARE NOT NECESSARILY SOLUTIONS OF THE FORMER ONE AND IT MAY BE A

MORE PROMINENT POINTS IN WHICH THE CALCULUS OF FUNCTIONS RESEMBLES COMMON ALGEBRA OR THE INTEGRAL CALCULUS IT OUGHT HOWEVER TO BE OBSERVED THAT SEVERAL OF THE RMETHODS WHICH I HAVE APPLIED TO THE

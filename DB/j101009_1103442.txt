and happiness is brought out in the case of Heisler v Heisler 127 Northwestern Reporter 823 The action is brought by the wife against her husbands parents for alienating her husbands love and affectiols Plaintiff was a telephone operator and a citybred girl when she met her future husband who was a Dutch farmer boy named Willie In the course of time after the necessary preliminaries they were married and the young wife was brought home to live with the old folks Unhappily however the folks were unpleased with their boys choice andl the fight began Father would have liked it better if Willie had married a big Dutch girl who could have worked in the fields and husked corn and worst of all she couldnt make gcod sauerkratt MAother didnt like her cook ing found fault with the new arrangement of the furniture with her raising too many chickens and with her foolish counsel to Villie in the operaticn of the farm Neither of the folks exended any sympathy or encouragemlent to their daughterinlaw but on the contriry were always inclined to criticise The result of all this was that Willie gradually began to think that he had mnade a poor pick in choosing a mate He began to dislike her soon hated her and his heart so hardened that on one occasion he cruelly beat her where upor she left them all presumably to go home to mother She brought an action for divorce which was granted and then brought this action against the parents of her divorced husband to recover dani ages for alienating her Willies love The Supreme Court of Iowa holds that parents by reason of their natural obligation to their child may counsel him as to his welfare and that of his wife providing that they do not act maliciously As to the charge against the father in condemning the sauerkraut the court said The kraut may have been indigestible but we never heard that discussions of the quality of kraut necessarily have a bearing on the state of the affections The court decided that no liability could be attached to him but as to the mother the evidence showed she had deliberately undermined Willies affections for his wife The lower court allowed 7000 dam ages but the Supreme Court held the verdict excessive reducing it to 2000 As to damages in concluding the court said It does not712 16 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan appear that plaintiffs health has been permanently impaired by the loss nor can the loss oi Willie as a husband be deemed very great when weighed in the scales of justice A man who instead of resent ing unfounded insinuations against his wife even when made by his mother will hie himself to the haymow to weep and then abuse her whom he has promised to protect is hardly worth quarrelling over But plaintiff liked him and is entitled to the damages suffered be cause of the alienation of such affection as he was capable of enter taining Right to Maintain ActionWhatever may have been the right of the wife to bring an action for alienation cf affections at common law there

Huling z Huling 32 Ill App Ct Rep 519 522 When a father or mother is charged with the alienation of a hus bands or wifes affections the quo animo is an important considera tion The reason for this is the right of the parents to advise their children when acting in good faith must be carefully protected as well as the rights of a husband or wife Rice v Rice 104 Mich 371 citing Hutcheson v Peck 5 Johns N Y 196 Accordingly it is no error to instruct the jury that a parent has a right in a moderate intelligent and careful manner to advise a son as to his domestic affairs and even as to living with his wife and that if such counsel and advice be given in good faith and from worthy mo tives the wife has no cause of complaint even though such advice may contribute in some degree to the result of causing a separation tluling z Huling 32 Ill App Ct Rep 519 522 A parent has a right to object to a sons marrying a woman of a certain faith and he has a right to advisehis son that it would be un wise for him to live with his wife if she again joined such church Rice v Rice 104 Mich 371 Moreover advice given by the defendant to his son after the sepa ration will not afford a cause of action Rice z Rice 104 Mich 371 But it is not the duty of a parent to advise the son not to separate from his wife and if he has made lup his mind to do so the defend ant cannot be held liable simply because he commended such action on the part of the son Rice  Rice 04 Mich 371 What Plaintiff Must ShowTnan action by a wife against a stran ger to recover damanes for the alienation of her husbands affections the plaintiff must show by a preponderance of evidence that the alien ation of affection and abandonment was caused by the defendant knowingly and by a irect and active interference Valdron

affections see Waldron v Wal dron 45 Fed Rep 315 The measure of damages in such action is based on the actual in jury to plaintiff by the loss of her husbands affection and support and on the pecuniary circumstances of defendant Waldron v Wal dron 45 Fed Rep 315 But it is error to allow the jury to award damages for loss of sup port where there was no evidence of the value of the same Rice

position of herself and husband as bearing upon the value of her hus bands consortium the wealth rank social position or condition of the defendant cannot be considered in assessing damages Bailey v Bailey 94 Iowa 598 63 N W 341 Hearsay Evidencelt is improper in an action by a wife against the parents of her husband for the recovery of damages alleged to have arisen through the alienation of his

plaintiffs husband a place to live on may be admitted to show that the defendant did as a matter of fact try to induce his son to do the very thing plaintiff was insist ing upon and to show the

plaintiff Bailey v Bailey 94 Iowa 598 63 N W 341 Weight and Sufficiency of EvidenceSuch a charge however is one easily made and as it affects the person the property and the character of the person charged with the wrong it should be proved by testimony convincing and satisfactory to the minds and con16 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER sciences of the jury The burden of proof is always upon the person makng such a charge and the charge should not be assumed to be true without evidence or without a preponderance of evidence to support it The evidence adduced may be circumstantial in charac ter and usually is in such cases but it slould be sufficient and satis factory to induce the jury to believe the charges to be true Waldron v Waldron 45 Fed Rep 315 317 Latitude of CrossExaminationThe ultimate question in cases of this kind is did defendant alienate from the plaintiff her husbands affections The state of her mind and the ardor of her love are not material except upon the question of damages The law indulges a presumption no doubt that the husband had affection for his wife and it rests with the defense to prove that he did not have Bailey v Bailey 94 Iowa 598 63 N W 341 Accordingly it cannot be shown on crossexamination that the plaintiff had her husband arrested before their marriage for the crime of seduction over an objection that such a question is beyond the latitude of crossexamination upon the mere ground that the plain tiff by offering herself as a witness by that act affirmed that he had affection for lier Bailey v Bailey 94 Iowa 598 63 N W 341 This

Appeals in Leach v Lynch 128 Southwestern Reporter 795 Judge Cox in deciding the case said that defendant had a right to remove the goat from his premises but ih doing so he had no right to injure it

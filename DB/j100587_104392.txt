SO MUCH MORTAR BETWIXT THAT THE TWO SEMICIRCLES RATHER FORM AN OVAL AND SO THE PILLARS LOOK AT FIRST SIGHT AS IF THEY WERE WREATHED THE SQUARE PILLARS ARE COMPOSED OF 13 COURSES OF BRICKS AS AT FIG 4

REACHING TO THE CENTRES OF FOUR ADJOINING PILLARS AS AT FIG 5 WHERE ONLY ONE OF THESE LARGER BRICKS IS REPRESENTED AS IT BEARS UPON FOUR OF THE SMALLER BRICKS WITH THEIR PILLARS UNDER THEM ON THIS COURSE OF BRICKS IS A COVERING OF CEMENT 6 INCHES THICK AND UPON THAT IS SET A TESSELLATED PAVEMENT THE TESSELLAE OF THE COR NER UNCOVERED K IN FIG 1 AND 2 ARE OF A WHITISH COLOUR L858 L AND M IN FIG 1 AND 2 ARE TWO TUBULI OR FLUES 12 INCHES WIDE AND 14 DEEP FOR CARRYING OFF THE SMOKE THE BOTTOMS OF THEM ARE EVEN WITH THE BOTTOM OF THE ALVEUS AND THEY ARE CARRIED UPON THE LEVEL ABOUT 15 FEET UNDER ANOTHER ROOM BY THE SIDE OF THE HYPOCAUSTUM AND THEN IT IS PRESUMED THEY TURN UPWARDS THE WALLS OF THIS ROOM WERE PLAISTERED AND THE PLAISTER PAINTED RED BLUE AND OTHER COLOURS AND ITS FLOOR TESSELLATED WHITE NO FIGURES DISCERNIBLE IN EITHER PAINTING OR PAVEMENT THIS PAVEMENT WHICH IS ON A LEVEL WITH THE TESTUDO OF THE HYPOCAUSTUM IS ABOUT 13 FEET BELOW THE PRE SENT SURFACE OF THE GROUND SO DEEP IS OLD LINDUM BURIED IN ITS RUINS THE WORKMEN IN DIGGING UP THIS PAVEMENT STRUCK INTO THE FLUE M 3 FEET FROM THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE HYPOCAUSTUM AND OPENED IT TO THE VERY CORNER K WHICH SHEWED ONE OF THE ROUND PILLARS AND SO THE WHOLE WAS DISCOVERED IN SINKING THE HOLE N K AT 5 OR 6 FEET DEPTH THEY CAME TO THE WALL WHICH WAS DUG UP BY PIECES WITH THE RUBBISH BEFORE THEY CAME TO THE PAVEMENT THIS HAD BEEN THE WALL OF A ROOM UNDER WHICH THE TU BULI RAN BY THE SIDE OF AND NOT OVER THE ALVEUS BUT ON THE EAST SIDE OF IT MR SYMPSON GOT A YOUTH TO CREEP IN AT THE OPEN ING MADE AT K AND TAKE THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SEVERAL PARTS WHO THE ALVEUS BEING QUITE BLACK WITH SMOKE RETURNED LIKE A CHIMNEYSWEEPER BUT COULD NOT TAKE THE EXACT MEASURES OF THE FORNAX AND PRAEFURNIUM ON ACCOUNT OF RUBBISH HE FOUND IN THEM WHERE FORE MR SYMPSON BEING DESIROUS TO INFORM HIMSELF THOROUGHLY OF ALL THE PARTS OF THIS CURIOUS PIECE OF ANTIQUITY WITH THE LEAVE AND AT THE EXPENCE OF THE PRO 7859 PROPRIETOR CAUSED ANOTHER HOLE TO BE SUNK 16 FEET DEEP AND BY DRIVING A LEVEL O P SEE FIG 1 AND 2 HE BROKE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE FORNAX AND HAVING CLEARED IT OF RUBBISH FOUND ITS DIMENSIONS AS ABOVE AND THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE NARROWEST PART BETWEEN F AND G WAS RAISED 18 INCHES HIGHER THAN THE BOTTOM OF THE  BETWEEN E AND F THE PRAEFURNIUM WAS COVERED OVER AT TOP WITH A LARGE FLAT STONE THE FORNAX AND THE TWO SQUARE PILLARS IN THE ALVEUS FRONTING THE OPENING OF THE FORNAX WERE GREATLY IMPAIRED BY THE FIRE WHICH MUST HAVE BEEN VERY VIOLENT SOME SMALL FRAGMENTS OF WOODCOAL WERE THROWN OUT AMONG THE RUBBISH IN THE BOTTOM OF THE FORNAX WHENCE PROBABLY IT WAS HEATED WITH WOOD AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE ACCOUNT MR SYMPSON SENT TO MR WILLIS HE GIVES US THE FOLLOWING RE MARK UPON A PASSAGE IN THE SECOND LETTER FROM MR BAXTER TO DR HARWOOD CONCERNING THE HYPOCAUSTA OF THE ANTIENTS PRINTED IN THESE TRANSACTIONS NO 306  MR BAXTER SAYS THE HYPOCAUSIS WAS CALLED AL  VEUS AND FORNAX BUT WITH DUE DEFERENCE TO THAT  LEARNED GENTLEMAN SAYS MR SYMPSON I HUMBLY  APPREHEND THEM TO HAVE BEEN DISTINCT PARTS OF THE  WHOLE WHICH WAS CALLED HYPOCAUSIS THE GROUND  OF MY CONJECTURE IS THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE IT  WOULD HARDLY BE POSSIBLE TO MAKE A FIRE IN THAT  PART OF THIS HYPOCAUST WHICH I CALL THE ALVEUS  MUCH LESS TO COME AT IT TO MANAGE IT BEING SO  LOW AND SO CROWDED WITH PILLARS AS TO ADMIT ONLY  A SLENDER PERSON TO CRAWL AMONGST THEM AND THAT 5 T  NOT860  NOT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY IN THE NEXT PLACE THE  FLOOR DOES NOT SEEM DESIGNED FOR IT NOR ARE  THERE ANY APPEARANCES OF ASHES ON IT AND  FURTHER THAT THE FORNAX WAS WHERE I HAVE  PLACED IT IN THIS APPEARS NOT ONLY FROM THE STRU  CTURE OF THAT PART BUT FROM THE BRICKS BEING MUCH  BURNT AND PIECES OF WOODCOAL BEING FOUND IN  IT WHEREAS IN THE ALVEUS THE BRICKS ARE ONLY  BLACK WITH THE STEAM AND SMOAK BEING DRAWN  THROUGH IT BY THE TUBULI BUT I SUBMIT MY OPI  NION TO YOUR BETTER JUDGMENT  HE MIGHT HAVE ADDED THAT ONLY THOSE PILLARS IN THE ALVEUS WHICH FACED THE MOUTH OF THE FORNAX HAD SUFFERED MUCH BY THE FIRE THE OTHERS NOT THAT HYPOCAUST DESCRIBED IN NO 306 ABOVEMEN TIONED MUST HAVE BEEN A MUCH HOTTER ROOM THAN THIS FOR INSTEAD OF THE FLUES BEING CARRIED UNDER ANOTHER ROOM THE WALLS OF THE SWEATINGROOM ITSELF WERE HOLLOW OR DOUBLE AND A GREAT NUMBER OF FLUES CARRIED UP BETWEEN THEM ALL ROUND THE ROOM A CURIOUS MODEL OF THIS IS STILL TO BE SEEN IN THE MU SEUM OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY XXX AC

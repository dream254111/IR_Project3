J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106680,ON THE METHOD OF DETERMINING FROM THE REAL PROBABILITIES OF LIFE THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT REVERSION IN WHICH THREE LIVES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SURVIVORSHIP BY MR WILLIAM MORGAN COMMUNICATED BY THE REV RICHARD PRICE D D F R S,I206941,40 V ON THE METHOD OF DETERMINING FROM THE REAL PROBABILITIES OF LIFE THE VALUE OF A CONTINGENT REVERSION IN WHICH THREE LIVES ARE INVOLVED IN THE SURVIVORSHIP BY MR WILLIAM MORGAN COMMUNICATED BY THE REV RICHARD PRICE D D F R S READ JANUARY 29 1789 IN A PAPER WHICH I HAD LATELY THE HONOUR OF COMMUNICATING TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY RESPECTING THE METHOD OF DETER MINING THE VALUES OF REVERSIONS DEPENDING ON SURVIVORSHIPS BETWEEN TWO PERSONS FROM THE REAL PROBABILITIES OF LIFE I OB SERVED THAT THE INVESTIGATION OF THOSE CASES IN WHICH THREE LIVES WERE INVOLVED IN THE SURVIVORSHIP THOUGH ATTENDED WITH MUCH MORE DIFFICULTY MIGHT HOWEVER BE EFFECTED IN A SIMILAR MANNER THE FURTHER PURSUIT OF THIS SUBJECT HAS NOW CON VINCED ME THAT AS IT IS NEVER SAFE SO LIKEWISE IT CAN NEVER BE NE CESSARY TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE EXPECTATIONS OF LIFE IN ANY CASE AND THAT THE SOLUTION EVEN OF THOSE PROBLEMS WHICH INCLUDE THREE LIVES IS FAR FROM BEING SO FORMIDABLE AS AT FIRST SIGHT IT APPEARS TO BE I AM SENSIBLE OF THE IMPROPRIETY OF ENTERING MINUTELY IN THIS PLACE INTO THE VAST VARIETY OF PROPOSITIONS WHICH REFER TO THE DIFFERENT ORDERS OF SURVIVORSHIP BETWEEN THREE LIVES BUT AS THE FOLLOWING PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE OF CONSIDERABLE IMPORTANCE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS BEING APPLIED TO THE SOLUTION

EXACT SOLUTION OF THIS PROBLEM IN ALL CASES BUT AS SUCH TABLES COMPUTED FOR EVERY AGE WOULD BE A WORK OF IMMENSE DIFFICULTY ESPECIALLY IN REGARD TO THE VALUES OF THREE JOINT LIVES MR SIMPSONS RULE FOR APPROXIMATING TO THESE FROM THE GIVEN VALUES OF THE TWO JOINT LIVES HAS HITHERTO BEEN ADOPTED AND IT SEEMS UPON THE WHOLE TO ANSWER THE PURPOSE VERY WELL IN THE PRESENT PROBLEM IT IS ATTENDED WITH NO OTHER INCONVENIENCE THAN INCREASING THE LABOUR OF THE COMPUTATIONS FOR THE VALUES OF THE REVERSIONS DERIVED FROM IT APPEAR IN GENE RAL TO BE PERFECTLY CORRECT THIS IS MORE FULLY ASCERTAINED BY A TABLE

AFFORD A CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE VERY SMALL DEVIATION FROM THE TRUTH IN THESE LATTER VALUES PROCEEDS NOT FROM ANY INACCURACY IN THE RULES THEMSELVES BUT SOLELY FROM HAVING USED THE APPROXIMATED INSTEAD OF THE REAL VALUES OF THE THREE JOINT LIVES AND THIS ALSO WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENCE IN THE VALUES BY THE FIRST AND SECOND RULES WERE THOSE VALUES COMPUTED FROM TABLES WHICH GIVE THE CORRECT VALUES OF TWO AND THREE JOINT LIVES AT ALL AGES THEY WOULD COME OUT EXACTLY THE SAME IN THE TWO FIRST EXAMPLES WHERE THE VALUES BY ONE RULE ARE TRUE IT APPEARS THAT THE VALUES BY THE OTHER RULE ARE EQUALLY SO IN THE TWO LAST EXAMPLES WHERE THE VALUES ARE NOT QUITE SO ACCURATE IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THEY DIFFER AS MUCH IN EXCESS BY ONE RULE AS THEY DO IN DEFECT BY THE OTHER WHICH MUST IN GENERAL BE THE CASE FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THOSE RULES FOR IF L OR THE VALUE BY THE FIRST RULE BE GREATER THAN THE TRUTH THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN R  1 V  CC2R AND 2L OR THE VALUE BY THE SECOND RULE

j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,106680,On the Method of Determining from the Real Probabilities of Life the Value of a Contingent Reversion in Which Three Lives are Involved in the Survivorship By Mr William Morgan Communicated by the Rev Richard Price D D F R S,i206941,40 V On the Method of determining from the real Probabilities of Life the Value of a contingent Reversion in which Three Lives are involved in the Survivorship By Mr William Morgan communicated by the Rev Richard Price D D F R S Read January 29 1789 IN a Paper which I had lately the honour of communicating to the Royal Society respecting the method of deter mining the values of reversions depending on survivorships between two persons from the real probabilities of life I ob served that the investigation of those cases in which three lives were involved in the survivorship though attended with much more difficulty might however be effected in a similar manner The further pursuit of this subject has now con vinced me that as it is never safe so likewise it can never be ne cessary to have recourse to the expectations of life in any case and that the solution even of those problems which include three lives is far from being so formidable as at first sight it appears to be I am sensible of the impropriety of entering minutely in this place into the vast variety of propositions which refer to the different orders of survivorship between three lives but as the following problem seems to be of considerable importance on account of its being applied to the solution of many other pro blems the demonstration of it perhaps may not be thought an improper addition to my former Paper PROBLEMMr MORGAN on Survivorships 41 P R O B L E M Supposing the ages of A B and C to

the number of persons living in the table at the age of A Let a a a a c represent the decrements of life at the end of the 1st 2d 3d 4th c years from the age of A Let b represent the number of persons living at the age of B and m n o p c the number of persons living at the end of the 1st 2d 3d 4th c years from the age of B In like manner let c represent the number of persons living at the age of C and d e f g c the number of persons living at the end of the 1st 2d 3d 4th c years from the age of C Let r also denote the value of   increased by its interest for a year In order to receive the sum S in the first year it is necessary either that all the three lives shall have died in that year A having died first B next and C last or that only the two lives A and B shall have died A having died first and that C shall have lived to the end of that year The proba bility that the three lives shall die in the first year is a bm cdabc The probability that they shall die in the order above

fraction a mn eabc The probability of the third by the fraction a mn e2 abc And the probability of the fourth contingency by the fraction a mn de2abc These seve ral fractions therefore multiplied into

the number of years purchase expressing the value of an estate or perpetual annuity to be entered upon at the failure of two out of any three equal lives is  the difference  between three times the values of two equal joint lives and  twice the values of three equal joint lives subtracted from  the perpetuity or V  3CC  2CCC The value there fore of such a reversion supposing it to depend on the failure of the three equal lives in any one particular order is since 2 thereMr MORGAN on Survivorships there are six such orders equally probable 16 X V  3CC  2CCC But it appears from the correction explained in Dr PRICES Treatise on Reversionary Payments Vol I p 34 that the value of a reversionary sum is always less than the value of an equivalent reversionary estate in the proportion of I to r The sum being S the equivalent estate or perpetual annuity is always S x r  1 and consequently the value of the sum S depending on the ceasing of three equal lives in any one particular order and thus determined is the same with that determined by the foregoing investigation that is S6 x r1r x V  3CC  2CC The investigation therefore is right and the correction and investigation demonstrate one another But the foregoing expression for determining the value of the reversion in this particular case is not only obtained imme diately from the series but also from the two different rules which have been given for determining the value when the lives are unequal and hence a proof arises of the truth of these rules as well as of the reasoning upon which they are founded Thus the first rule supposing the lives all equal becomes x2c2 x KKCKK6  ddcc r x TTCTT6  r1r x CCCCC3  xc x CKCCK6  dcr x CTCCT6 and the second rule becomes V  CC   12r  x2c x KK  CKK3  ddcc r x TT  CTT3  r1r x CC  CCC3

r  1 V CC  2 r 1 CC  CCC2r and L  r16r x V  3CC  2CCC Q E D Were we possessed of complete tables of the values of annui ties on two and three joint lives the preceding rules would give an easy and exact solution of this problem in all cases But as such tables computed for every age would be a work of immense difficulty especially in regard to the values of three joint lives Mr SIMPSONS rule for approximating to these from the given values of the two joint lives has hitherto been adopted and it seems upon the whole to answer the purpose very well In the present problem it is attended with no other inconvenience than increasing the labour of the computations for the values of the reversions derived from it appear in gene ral to be perfectly correct This is more fully ascertained by a table which Dr PRICE has given in his Treatise on Rever sionary Payments Vol II Table 37 of the values of three equal joint lives computed at 4 per cent from the probabilities of life at NORTHAMPTON By the assistance of this table when the lives are of the same age it is evident from what has been already observed that the exact value of the reversion may be easily obtained The few following specimens com puted from it and compared with the values of the reversions deduced from the first and second of the preceding rules de monstrate the accuracy of those rules for notwithstanding the approximated values of the three joints lives have been used in every instance in which the rules have been employed yet the results approach so near the truth even in the last stages of life when the decrements are most irregular that though derived from these approximations there can be little doubt of their correctness in almost every other period of life 6 CommonMr MORGAN on Survivorships 51 Common age

former by deducing his rules immediately from a wrong hypothesis having rendered  That is onesixth part of the whole reversion  The several reversions in this column when computed from SIMPSONS approximation to the values of the three joint lives are 12012 12933 13847 and 14803 respectively which upon the whole differing nearly as much from the real values as those in the two other columns afford a convincing proof that the very small deviation from the truth in these latter values proceeds not from any inaccuracy in the rules themselves but solely from having used the approximated instead of the real values of the three joint lives And this also will account for the difference in the values by the first and second rules Were those values computed from tables which give the correct values of two and three joint lives at all ages they would come out exactly the same In the two first examples where the values by one rule are true it appears that the values by the other rule are equally so In the two last examples where the values are not quite so accurate it may be observed that they differ as much in excess by one rule as they do in defect by the other which must in general be the case from the very nature of those rules for if L or the value by the first rule be greater than the truth the difference between r  1 V  CC2r and 2L or the value by the second rule must be less than truth and on the contrary if L be less this difference will be greater than the truth  See DODSONS Mathematical Repository Vol III Questions 4243c  See SIMPSONS Select Exercises Prob 38 H 2 most52 Mr MORGAN on Survivorships most of them especially those in which three lives are con cerned of no use it will be unnecessary to take notice of what he has done on the subject With regard to the latter whose rule is not only the sole guide for determining the value of this reversion but also the source from which a great va riety of other problems are solved perhaps it may not be improper to examine how far his solution is to be depended upon and the following examples have therefore been com puted for this purpose T A B L E I Value by SIMPSONS rule of True value of the

tables Mr SIMP SONS rule appears in almost every instance to be exceedingly incorrect Even when the lives are equal in which case it might have been expected to be sufficiently accurate it seems to deviate in old age at least so widely from the truth as to be unfit for use When C or B are eldest which however is a case that does not often occur the results sometimes exceed the truth onehalf and generally by more than one third of the real value When A is the oldest of the three lives which is the most common case these results are erro neous in nearly an equal degree Nay in some cases Mr SIMPSONS rule is not only wrong but absurd Thus in the last example in the second table the value of  100 payable on the contingency of C aged 18 surviving B aged 78 after A aged 78 is by this rule   37554 The value therefore of the same sum on the contingency of Cs surviv ing A after B is also  37554 Hence the value of  100 on the contingency of Cs surviving A and B without the restriction of one dying before the other is 2 X 37554   75108  By another rule of Mr SIMPSON  the value  See SIMPSONS Select Exercises Prob 39  Ibid Prob 32 of54 Mr MORGAN on Survivorships of  100 on the contingency of Cs surviving B only is no more than  74  Now it is selfevident that this latter value instead of being less ought to have been greater than the former inasmuch as the probability of Cs surviving only one life must be greater than that of his surviving two lives Many additional instances might be produced in which this rule being made the basis upon which the solutions of other problems are founded leads to conclusions equally erroneous But these enquiries would be improper here and I shall only observe that had the foregoing examples been computed from the SWEDEN or LONDON instead of the NORTHAMP TON Table this rule would have appeared to be still more in correct than it does from those computations When Mr SIMPSON wrote his Select Exercises he was in a great measure obliged to have recourse to DE MOIVRES hypo thesis for want of those excellent tables of the real probabi lities of life and also of the values of single and joint lives which have been since published Had he been possessed of these it is most likely that this superior abilities would have directed him to a more accurate method of investigation At present there can be no just reason for ever recurring to this wretched hypothesis The solutions of all cases of two and even of three lives may be effected without much difficulty from principles strictly true But I must here take my leave of this subject hoping that its importance may engage other mathematicians to the further prosecution of it  The true values are  66038 and  74884 respectively

uphold parataloid in the terrible searchlight of the Virchow and Chiari necropsies and it is questioned whether the reported imiprovement of Kaposis cases of lupus promises permanent cure in that form of ttiberculous disease Experience with Kochs fluiid in this country has afforded results no more favorable Koch nevertbeless hopes I to extract from the tubercle bacillus its curative substance alone and there remains on all sides enduring hope that true curative power can be liberated from the parata loid 2 Is it generally known tht the homceopathic school has for many years made use serviceably not poisonously of Kochs material in the treatmenlt of c nsumiption and other tuberculous disease For twenty years this most misunderstood and maligned body of observers bas recognized the indispensable curative ser vice of the products of disease and in addition the necessity I for their extreme attenuation before they mnight be safely adminis tered in sickness  Tuberculinum 1anthracin and sycotin belong witlh such drugs as arsenic wlhich develops dangerous lesions if given to persotis in health but is curative in certain dis turlbed conditions The testimony given by these physicians ap pears singularly fitting and their experience would he of vital inmportance at this time of wliolesale experiment threatened by the followers of Koch I will now attempt to describe the cultus and professiona1 training of these men who are accused by the dominant school of failure to accomplish any thing for medical science of bigotry of narrowness and of  having a fixed be lief  4 The college requirements for students of homocopathy do not differ materially trom those of the older school Many of these students are already graduates of Harvard or of foreign medical schools who afterward finish their studies at a homceopathic college  By their fruits ye shall know them Among thenoteworthy results of a professional education in the methods of this school has been thle tdiscovery of unexpected renmedial agents far in ad vance of other medical in vestigators The homceopaths have long recognized the life resulting from leath innaturalgrowths and hiave not hesitated to explore filth decay and disease for nuorbific products or nosodes Diseased maiterial from animals and plants and the poisonous secretions Qf reptiles fishes and insects are found to be indispensably curative in desperate or obscure dis eases biht are only thus helpful when the poowers of each have been clearly differentiated by a thorough proving Is it generally known wbat is meant by a proving or study of a remedial agent Let me then briefly show you the labor the research and the professional skill required to make a proving A proving is made by administering to several healthy persons a substance or extract and recording its effects with the ultimate object of using the proven material in disease Each agent must be studied 1 with regard to its chetnical functional and the whole pathological effects in the body Study the pulse actions of the heart lungs brain kidneys liver systems of nerves bloodves sels ly mphaties glands digestive organs machinery of the senses each anatomical part and tissue Study the connection of the proven material with eruptions parasites contagions climates influenees inherited or acquired Note the resemblance of this to other drugs and its antidotes Above all there must be pereep tions of mental states tact to avoid deceit artistic insight and quick siglt for all these matters sought out by stethoscope opbthalnioscope sphygmograph microscope analyses of the urine blood etc and the whole armentarium of a modern physician enter into the preparation of a proving and must be brought to gether with laborious painstaking care before the proving is offered Professor Constantine Hering prepared in the year 1850 for his colleagues of the medical college at Allentown Penn a scheme of twenty closely written pages simply directions for epitomizing and recQrding their provings The systematic habit of German university training which has given their prestige to Germansci entists was thus early brought to bear upon students in this matter A proving is accepted and enters materia medica and textbook only after its characteristics have been confirmed by scores often by hundreds of independent observers At last the proving stands full of interest a new discovery an elaborate sometimes a learned analysis entirely unknown to old school methods and one more weapon is ready for use The authorized works of homoeopathic materia medica are very numerous fully elev en hundred remedies are available2 Many practising physicians carry in memory the chief characteristies of the greater proportion of these Provings and the repertories founded upon them naturally differ in value yet a curious observer tnust I think find in the general result the evidence of such persistent industry and scien tific researeh that all statements which assume a lack in either respect obviously proceed from uninformed persons Regarding attainments in literature and the liberal sciences per se a welcome addition no doubt to the real service of nedical men and the supposed lack of whicb on the part of these pracili tioners has been made the subject of gra ve comment3 t four bright spirits only in all these two thousand years of physicians have seats been assigned among the itnmorta3 Hippocrates Galen Sir Thomas Browne finally Dr Holmes have severally gained a place in letters Each of these is a rebel and an innova tor for withouit rebellion and innovation was never yet wrought any good thing But fifty years have passed since the death of Hahnemlann himilself a man whose vast learning was fully recog nized in his time4 Meanhile neither poet nor sage has yet chanced to be  an ornament to his profession The fact is its founders have been at work so hard that they have had no time to hold up their heads to sing 1

provings of the homceopaths for the raison dl gtre of a proving has not been explicitly given in the preceding pages Hippocrates Hahnemann and Sydenham hy pothecated and finally taught that the proving or testing of medicines upon the healthy would show the exact curative power of each remedy in disease This doctrine was formulated by Hippocrates in the aphorism or axiom similia similibus curentur I cure by similars  Jenner by vaccination and Pasteur and Koch by their inoculations have more recently illustrated the effects under this hvpothesis of a limited class of remedies but to Hahnemann and his successors alone with their elaborate sys tem of full descriptive provings of nearly every known medicinal agent is due the gradual establishment of a law educed from the original working hypothesis of Hippocrates That the law of sitnilars cannot be explained a priori ie upon any material or mechanical grounds is to my mind at once to be admitted before we can accept it as a fundamental principle or startingpoint exactly like that of electricity or chem ical force The law is that disease is cured by an influence simi lar to that which produces it However daring the first asstump tion of this law of similars it has now passed through the stages recorded in the history of every established science ie it has been submitted to induction deduction and verification Mere observation of instances is not inductive and does not lead to science until through the study of instances we rise to fixed law With such a law prophecy or deduction must be pos sible and the accuracy of this prophecy or verification will be a fresh test of the original law The homceopathic law being tested in reference both to norrnal and the diseased conditions of the human body has the logical advantage of a double verification and may thus be said to be rediscovered every day in the practice and provings of each homceopathic physician It is then law not luck which has enabled the homceopaths to reach their very conisistent results Their remedies in common use are an emphatic delmonstration of the practical value of the law of similars such as mercurius which causes eruptions sali vation and diarrhcea and is undeniably curative in these forms of disease quinine which causing ague symptoms relieves them nitroglycerine which removes the form of congestive headache inevitably produced by it in a healthy person And if the imperfected discovery of Koch be indeed a conspicuous and brilliant blossom of medical science it is the startling fact that this law of similars plucked the flower long ago and aided by its accessory of safe dilution or attenuation has made intelligent use of its discovery To confine our attention to testimony bearing directly on the treatment of tuberculous disease The proving of tuberculinum shows as its primary effect evidence of a deposit of tubercle at the base of the brain Severe and unbearable headaches are a prominent symptom with local congestion delirium and insanity more remotely and as later manifestations cough purulent sputa and diarrhcea The remedy tuberculinum has been for years helpfully given in meningitis hereditary and inveterate head aches hectic fever niaht sweats cough with tuberculous expec toration and all early stages of phthisical disease It would thus appear that in those first stages of consumption which alone are claimed to be curable by the injection of Kochs fluid the homceopaths have made safe yet effective use of the same materia morbi as Kochs2 Instead of protection by boiling cultivation etc a high attenuation has been efficient This attenuation made ehiefly by means of dilute alcohol is claimed to accomplish somethino beyond the mere subdivision of material 1 Science presents itself as exact and verifled knowledge   if observa tion and verification cannot demonstrate the real existence of the genus phi losophy itself in any sane sense of the word is annihilated  Dr F B Abbot The New Ideal May 1889 2 See New Organon July 189 pp 142 439 449 Dr Swans Morbific Prod ucts 1886 Burnetts New Cures 1885 to 1890 J A Bieglers Report C Herings Guiding Symptoms vol x now in press 8 Attenuations thus far made by the French experimenters have been un satisfactory both on account of the uncertain strength of the dilutions and also by reason of changes of quality wrought by cultivation of the original material The writer is aware of Kochs statement that the albuminoid principle of parataloid is insoluble in alcohol The simple dilution of the latter avoids this difficulty chiefly by checking its coagulative effect The irritant particles are mechanically detached while the curative principle is separated and developed  The degree of attenuation used always ranged as high as a socalled thirtieth potency After Darwins statement of the minuteness of the spores of drosera capable of producing their characteristic action the efficiency of a potency or attenuation does not to many per sons seem improbable and we will leave for the present the mathematics so frequently discussed It will readily be seen however that treatment by nosodes might soon degenerate into an enthusiastic thoughtless and emn pirical use of these remedies to the exclusion of others if the inference were drawn that each microbic disease could be annihi lated by its own potentized product and it has naturally been found impossible to remove by theadministration of its nosode alone the whole ultimate disturbance in the form of secondary symptoms sequences and diseases of distant parts of the body Indeed other remedies might even from the beginning of treat ment be more serviceable than these Thus in faithful treat ment it is sought to accomplish an end far more subtle than the mechanical removal of bacilli Holding them to be merely para sites amnong which may exist manv forms not inimical to health but even fulfilling protective service in the body the homceopath does not consider it essential that its bacillus be seen in the atom of diseased inaterial which he prepares for medicinal use the bacillus would almost necessarily be there for each characteristic parasite is the carrier of the disease in which it dwells but it is the deadly materialI in which the microbeparasite feeds which alone is desired for proving finally for prophylaxis and therapeu tic use2 The ancient school attacks the new having known but little of its large work but tbetime has gone by for dismissing without a hearing suich claims as led Wilson the anatomist to employ homceopathy for himself and Sir Sidney Ringer to incorporate verbatim large sections of its materia medica in his authoritative work These are the stars in the firmament of homueopathy  men of affairs men of business

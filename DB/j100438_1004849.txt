J100438,TRANSACTIONS OF THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY,1004849,EXPLANATION OF A SINGULAR PHENOMENON FIRST OBSERVED BY DR FRANKLIN AND NOT HITHERTO SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR IN A LETTER FROM MR R PATTERSON TO DR B RUSH,I241955,NO V EXPLANATION OF AFIIGUKLR PHENOMENON FIRFI OBFERVED BY DR FRA NKLIN AND NOT HITHERTO FATISFA6ORILY ACCOUNTED1 FOR IN A LETTERFROMN MR R PATTERSON TO DR B RU S I S I R R EAD O 1 RPEMEMBER FEVERAL YEARS AGO TO HAVE READ S 1787 IN ONE OF DR FRANKLINS PHILOFOPHICAL TRAAS AN ACCOUNT OF A FINGUILAR PHENOMENON OBFERVED WHEN A VEFLEL CONTAINING OIL AND WATER IS PTUT IN MOTIONTHUS IF A GLAFS TUMBLER FOR INFTANCE ABOUT TWO THIIRDS FILLED WITLH EQUAL PARTS OF WATER AND OIL BE MOVED GENTLY BACK WARDS ANID FORWARDS IN THE HAND OR FUFPENDED BY A CORD BE MADE TO FWING LIKE THE PENDULUM OF A CLOCK THE FUR FACE OFTHE WATER IN CONTAA WITH THE OIL WHICH FLOATS UP ON IT WILL BE TTHROWN INTO A VIOLENT WAVELIKE COMIMOTION WHILE THE UPPER FURFACE OT THE OIL WILL BE COMPARATIVELY PLACID AND EVEN RFHE DOAOR OBFERVES THAT HAVING FHEWN THIS EXPERI MEAT TO A NUMBR OF INGENIOUS PERFONS  THOFE WHO ARE BUT14 P HEN O MEN ON BUT FLIGHTLY ACQUAINTEDWITH THE PRINCIPLES OF HYDROFLATICS C ARE APT TO FANCY IMMEDIATELY THAT THEY UNDERILAND IT AND READILY ATTEMPT TO EXPLAIN IT BUT THEIR EXPLANATIONS HAVE BEEN DEFFICIENT AND TO ME NOT VERY INTELLIGIBLE OTHERS MORE DEEPLY FKILLED IN THOFE PRINCIPLES FEEM TO WONDER AT IT ANDPROMIFE TO CONFIDER IT AND I THINK ADDS THE DODTOR IT IS WORTH CONFIDERING FOR A NEW AP PEARANCE IF IT CANNOT BE EXPLAINED BY OUR OLD PRINCIPLES MAY AFFORD US NEW ONES OF UFE PERHAPS IN EXPLAINING FOME OTHER OBFCURE PARTS OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE WHEN I READ THIS ACCOUNT I FORMED IN MY OWN MIND A FOLUTION OF THE PHENOMENON WHICH PERHAPS FROM THE CAUFE MENTIONED ABOVE FATISFIED MYFELF AND HAVE NOT FINCE CONFIDERED THE FUBJEAT NIOR FEEN ANIY THING WRITTEN UPON IT TILL THE OTHER DAY WHEN LOOKING OVER THE 2D VOL OF THE MANCHEJIER SOCIETYS MIEMOIRS I FOUND THE MATTER MENTIONED THERE ANCD TWO DIFFERENT FOLUTIONS ATTEMPTED ONE BY DR THOMAS PERCIVAL OF MANCHEFLER AND THE O TLHER BY DR WALL OF OXFORD DR PERCIVAL FUPPOFES  THAT THE FAD IN QUEFTIONMAY ARIFE FROM A REPULFIVE POWER FUB FIFLING BETWEEN THE PARTICLES OF OIL AND WATER AND DEPEND ING POFFIBLY UPON THE VIBRATIONS OF THAT FUBTILE ETHER WHICH SIR IFAAC NEWTON FUPPOFES TO PERVADE ALL BODIES FOR WHEN THIS ETLHER IS EXCITED INTO MOTION BY PERCUFFION OR AGITATI ON ITS ELAFTIC FORCE IS AUGMENTED BECAUFE IT BECOMES DEN FER IN THE PULFES OF ITS VIBRATIONS THAN IN A QUIEFCENT FLATE DR WALL THINKS  THAT THE COFNMOTION WHICLI THE WATER UNDERGOES WHILE THE OIL REMAINS TRANQUIL DEPENDS UPONI THE DIFFERENT FPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE TWO FLUIDS WHLEREBY THEY RECEIVE THE FORCE OF THE IMPULFE IN UNEQUAL PROPORTI ONS AND UPON THE DIFPOFITION OF THE OIL FROM ITS FUPERIOR LEVITY TO PREFERVE ITS PLACE UPON THE TOP OF THE WATER WWHATEVER AGITATION TLHE WATER BENEATH MAY BE FUBJEDED TO THAT IS AS I UNLERFTAND IT THE WATER BEING FPECI FICALLY LHEAVIER THAN THE OIL WILL FROM THE AAION OF A GIV EAA S IN GU LAR EN IMPULFE ACQUIRE A GREATER MOTION THAN THE OIL AND THAT THEREFORE THE WAVES EXCITED ON THE FURFACE OF THE ONE WILL BE GREATER THAN THOFE ON THE FURFACE OF THE OTHERUP ON THIS PRINCIPLE THEN IF QUICKFILVER BE FUBIFITUTED IN PLACE OF THE WATER THE COMMOTION EXCITED IN IT WOULD BE FLILL GREATER THAN THAT IN THE WATER AS IT WOULD  RECEIVE THE FORCE OF THE IMPULFE FORM ITS FUPERIOR FPECIFIC GRAVITY IN A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION BUT INFA271 THE DIREA CON TRARY WILL BE FOUND TO BE THE CAFE MOREOVER IF TWVO FLU IDS OF UNEQUAL FPECIFIC GRAVITIES BE PUT FEPARATELY INTO TWO DIFFERENT GLAFFES AND MOVED WITH EQUAL VELOCITIES THE COMMOTION EXCITED IN THE HEAVIER FLUID WILL BE APPARENTLY LEFS THAN THAT IN THE LIGHTER THE FORMER FROM ITS GREATER FPECIFIC GRAVITY PREFERVING ITS LEVEL FURFACE WITH MORE OB FIINACY THAN THE LATTER WHICH IS CONTRARY TO WHAT OUGHT TO TAKE PLACE UPON THE ABOVE PRINCIPLES BUT WITHOUT ENTERING FURTHER INTO A REFUTATION OF THE ABOVE FOLUTION I FHALL FLBMIT TO YOUR CONFIDERATION ONE WLHICH TO ME AT LEAFT APPEARS BETTER TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS FINGULAR PHENOMENON I WHEN THE TENDENCY OF A BODY UPWARDS IS JUJ EQUAL TO ITS TENDENCY DOWNWARTTS IT WVILL THEN UPON THE LEAJF INMPULFIVE FORCE MOVE INDIFFERENTLY IN EITHER DIRESLIONI RFHIS IS THE CAFE OF A BODY IMMERFED IN A FLUID OF THE FAME FPECIFIC GRAVITY WHERE THE BUOYANCY OF THE FLUID TO RAIFE THE BODY UPWARDS IS JUFT EQUAL TO THE POWER OF GRAV ITY TO DRAW IT DOWNWARDS 2 WHEN THE TENDENCY OF A BODY UPWARDS IS NEARLY EQUAL TO ITS TENDENCY DOWNWARDS TLHEN A FINALL IMPULFIVE FORCE UPWARDS WILL MOVE IT IN THAT DIREAJION THIS IS THE CAFE OF A BODY IMMERFED IN A FLTIID OF NEARLY EQUAL FPECIFIC GRAVITY FOR THEN THE RELATIVE GRAVITY OR TENDENCY OF THE BODY DOANIWARDS WILL BE ONLY THE EXCEFS OF ITS FPECIFIC GRAVITY ABOVE THAT OF THE FLUID IN WHICH IT IS IMMERFEDBUT WATER IINMIERFED IN COMMION OIL IS JULT IAP H EN OMENON IN THE CIRCUMFIANCES LAFF MENTIONED AND THEREFORE A FMALL IMULFIVE FORCE FUCH AS THAT COMMUNICATED BY FWINGING THE VEFFEL BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS WILL BE FUFFICIENT TO RAIFE THE WATER INTO WAVES AND PRODUCE THAT COMMOTION WHICH IS DEFCRIBED BY DR FRANKLIN IN THE EXPERIMENT AL LUDED TO IF THIS REAFONING BE JUFI THEN THE LEFS DIFFERENCE THERE IS BETWEEN THE FPECIFIC GRAVITIES OF THE TWO FLUIDS THE GREATER WILL THE AGITATIONI EXCITED IN THE LOWER FLUIDL BE AND VICE VEIFL AND ACCORDINGLY YOU WILL CONFLANTLY FIND THIS TO BE THE CAFE FOR IF QUICKFILVERL BE ONE OF THE FLUIDS THE WAVES EXCITED IN IT WILL BE BUT VERY FINALL IF WATER AND OIL LE UFED THE WAVES OIN THE FWATER WILL BE MUCH GREATER BUT IF FPIRITS AND OIL OF NEARLY EQUAL FPECIFIC GRAVITIES BE MADE UFE OF THE COMMOTION EXCITED IN THE LOWER FLUID WILL BE VERY CONFIDERABLE INDEED HENCE WE FEE THE REAFON WHY THE MOTION GIVEN TO A MUG OF CYDER OR BEER AFTER LHAVING FLOOD BEFORE THE FIRE TO WARM BY FWINGING IT BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN THE HIAND AS THLE COMMION CUFLOM IS IN THE WINTER BEFORE ONE DRINKS WILL LO EFFEDTUALLY MIX THE COLD AND WARM PARTS OF THE LI QUOR TOGETHER WHICH BEFORE OCCULPIED DIFFERENT PLACES IN THE MUG THE ILACID APPEARANCE OF THE UPPER FURFACE OF THE OIL IN TLHEABOVE EXPERIMENT IS NO DOUBT TO BE ATTRIBUTED IN PART TO THE TENACITY OR GLUTINOUS CONFIFLANCE OF THAT FLULID BUT THE CHIEF CAUFE UNDOUBTEDLY IS THE GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ITS FPECIFIC GRCAVITY AND THAT OF TBE AIR THE FLUID IN WHICIH IT IS IMINERFED FOR IF OIL BE INADE THE LOWER FLUID BY UFING WITH IT ANY OTHER FLUID OF LEFS FPECIFIC GRA VITY IT WILL NOT WITHFLANDING THE TENACITY OF ITS PARTICLES V IHILE ANY CONFIDERABLE DEGREE OF FLUIDITY REMAINS BE AF FEDTED IN THE FAME MANNER AS ANY OTHER FLUID IN LIKE CIR CUMF1ANCEST AN

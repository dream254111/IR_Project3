abundance of water The only locality where the watersupply problem attains great impor tance is at the summit level between the Mohawk River and Oneida Lake This is provided for for the larger canal by utilizing the existing sources of supply and developing additional ones by water storage in West Canada Creek the Mohawk River and Oriskany Creek If in the future more water is needed due to increased use of the canal or for any other reason this can be supplied by addi tional storage in the Adirondacks at a comparatively small expense It is believed that these new and enlarged canals will be of benefit to New York in enabling her to retain and increase her commercial supremacy largely through their controlling influence on freight rates and the prevention of differential discrimination against the port of New York which is now and has for years been the rule They will also benefit the entire region of the Great Lakes and this benefit will extend far into the interior of the Great North west and influence transportation rates throughout the country Upon the Great Lakes many millions of tons of freight are transported every year at exceedingly low ratesfar lower than are possible by any other than water transportation The canals that New York has undertaken to build will practically extend this cheap system of water transportation to the seaport of New York and other ports in the vicinity and bind the East and West closer together THE NEW STIELERS HANDATLAS Gotha was the undisputed centre of geographic science for a considerable period of the igth century beginning with the year 1854 when August Petermann became connected with the firm of Justus Perthes Thus the new issue of Stielers Handatlas which approaches completion may be regarded as a jubilee celebration This idea leads Dr Hermann Wagner in the January number of Petermanns Mitteilungen to discuss the history of that atlas and incidentally to sketch the development of cartography as applied to atlasmaking during the i9th century  An Abstract of Dr H Wagners paper in Petermanns Mitteilungen Band 50 Heft iThe New Stielers Handatlas Stielers atlas first appeared in 1816 and is thus 88 years old Atlases are generally longlived owing to the great investment of capital which they involve The plates are handed down from father to son and grandson giving rise to veritable dynasties of geographic editors and publishers Stielers atlas was surpassed by many of its predecessors in size and in rapidity of publication Among them may be mentioned Ortelius Theatrum orbis ter rarum  since I570 Mercators Atlas since 1595 which soon thereafter was vastly enlarged by Hondius sen and jun and Joh Janssonius I65t in 6 volumes with 450 maps the giant collec tions of Willem and Joan Blaeu I63I1673 those of the Sansons in France since 1648  the atlases of Delisle afterward published by his soninlaw Buache and Homanns atlases since 1707 which were the standard in Germany in the i8th century But these cannot compare to Stieler either in length of life or in organic development They consisted mostly of republications of earlier maps while the various editions of Stieler represent not only the latest record of data but also the latest achievements in cartography Dr Wagner is thus led to discuss the requirements which a modern atlas must satisfy The oldest edition of Stieler looks primitive enough nowadays yet it contained the leading features to which its popularity has ever since been duehandy size the greatest practicable uniformity in projections uniformity or simple proportions of scale systematic lettering avoidance of overloading etc The temptation to increase the size of map sheets is great because the number of sheets is thus lessened the number of scales reduced and duplication in marginal work largely avoided How ever the convenience in handling proves in the long run a greater advantage The good judgment shown by Stieler in selecting the size of 35 by 29 cm and by his successors in increasing it to no more than 41 by 35 cm has been demonstrated by experience The average buyer looks for an atlas which he can put on an ordinary library shelf lift with one hand lay flat on the ordinary writing desk and inspect without either rising or craning his neck Out of Ioo sheets only io lie crosswisean important consideration to the user The problem of scales is a knotty one for the editor of an atlas Having a given number of areas of different sizes to represent he naturally wishes to fit them with the least possible waste of space into his map sheets which are all of the same size This would involve the use of as many scales as there are maps The user on 265The New Stielers Handatlas the other hand would prefer to have all the maps on the same scale since this would enable him at a glance to estimate any dis tance or area A compromise between these two requirements is found in using as few scales as possible and in making the larger scales simple multiples of the smaller Adolf Stieler attempted this as early as i816 His normal scale was i Paris foot to x60 geographic miles or about I 3 million for the special sheets of European states he chose the double of that scalefor Europe one fifth for the other continents onetenth etc This still leaves large areas which cannot be made to fit into such simple propor tions and this fact increases the number of scales greatly beyond that of the great majority of the maps While in recent times the tendency has been to choose round numbers such as 1500000 I2000000 13000000 the old scale of i 3z million has been retained for 20 maps of the new Stieler because it enabled large countries like Russia and the United States to be shown on the same scale The selection of I7500000 for the special maps of countries outside of Europe in the new Stieler is regarded by Dr Wagner as one of its greatest merits since it enables no less than 25 maps to be drawn on the same scale The original number of some 20 different scales for 83 maps 842 has in the latest edition of Stieler been reduced to 14 Dr Wagner adds a word of caution against the tendency to represent certain areas in sectional sheets susceptible of being joined into a single sheet While for certain objects this method has manifest advantages it is apt to shock the reader who expects each map to represent a complete geographic unit framed as it were in a fringe of adjoining countries In high latitudes moreover it causes the central meridian to run obliquely across the sheet to the perpetual irritation of cartographic nerves As regards projections Lamberts azimuthal projection meets with special recommendation from Dr Wagner as more true to nature than the Bonne or the SansonFlamsteed projections In this respect the new Stieler is surpassed by some of the more recent atlases However the Lambert projection is to be used for Africa and will no doubt be increasingly used in future editions The original plan to limit the number of sheets to 50 had soon to be given up Before Stielers death in 1836 the number had been increased to 75 The latest number Ioo is probably the limit of convenience in handling Im mapping this or that area in greater or less detail each atlas has of course to consult the requirements of the public for which it is mainly intended Stielers atlas being intended for the 266The New Stielers Handatlas public of central Europe offers instructive evidence of the widen ing sphere of interests of that public as appears from the following table CENTRAL REST OF OUTSIDE

continued with but a brief interruption was that of indicating on each map the name of the cartographer and in many cases also that of the engraver Adolf Stieler produced more than half the original maps Those outside of Europe were mostly drawn by C G Reichard A few were furnished by 0 Hubbe F von Stulpnagel began to contribute in 1824 and after Stielers death the work fell more and more to his share so that in the edition of i860 he furnished not less than 53 out of the 83 maps In the early days some of the dozen engravers lived elsewherein Berlin Wei mar etc so that complete uniformity was out of the question The representation of the configuration suffered especially but yet the clearness and legibility of the maps attracted the layman while the care and accuracy with which the data were used won the praise of experts The fifth decade of its existence marked the period when the atlas became the pioneer in cartographic achievement It is asso ciated with the names Hermann Berghaus Carl Vogel and espe cially August Petermann Berghaus merit lay in the care which he devoted to the configuration Vogels in the uniform treatment of topographic material Petermann developed a new school of engravers He reformed the lettering and introduced the stencil method of colouring The work of such engravers as Jungmann Hase Stichartand W Weiler about i860 constitutes a revolu tion in the representation of topographic forms After I86i begins the work of such cartographers as E Debes AWelcker L Friede richsen H Habenicht Br Hassenstein Fr Hanemann and 0 Koffmahn Petermanns own cartographic work was mostly confined to countries outside of Europe as might be expected of the chronicler of the great discoveries of that time The topo graphic material of European states was mostly worked up by Carl 267The New Stielers Handatlas Vogel whose unexcelled sheets have been very justly included in the latest edition It was the great merit of the Perthes firm that it allowed every original mind to develop itself in its own way to spend ample time on its work and to make the most extensive cor rections when necessary In this way Stielers atlas in the seven ties attained an undisputed position as the master work of the cartographic art After i880 cartography till then mainly centred in Gotha be came decentralized Richard Andrees Allgemeiner Handatlas appeared in i88i and owing to its unprecedentedly low price sat isfied a widespread demand It represented the most extensive attempt at colour printing up to date The firm of Velhagen  Klasing published its atlas which under Scobels direction grew to such proportions as to represent at this day the most extensive cartographic volume in Germany In I895 followed Debes Neuer Handatlas in excellent lithography and neatest colour print Spamers Handatlas brought French map work in German dress Petermann having died in 1878 Stielers atlas was for some time published in the old style but a remodelling became imperative if it was to maintain its lead in cartography Resisting the increas ing tendency to use lithography or other processes of reproduction the publishers decided to adhere to copper engraving but to bring it up to the perfection of modern cartography in colour printing The 52 maps thus far published bring Dr Wagner to the conclusion that the atlas has once more gained the lead in its class of publica tions In its present dress the atlas represents the everincreasing ten dency toward specialization Until not very long ago there was only one kind of atlas just as geology included palaeontology mineralogy and petrography Now we have school atlases physi cal political ethnologic geologic atlases Among these the  Handatlas  occupies approximately the same position that the  general practitioner  does among medical specialists The vari ous branches of mapmaking have become so extensive that no sin gle publication can embody them The general atlas assumes the coexistence of special atlases It thus dispenses more and more with detailed representations of physical geography geology anthropology etc Thus Stielers atlas has what may be called companion publications in Berghaus Physical Atlas and in Vogels map of the German Empire in 27 sheets on the scale of i 500000 The existence of these necessarily restricts the space devoted to those subjects in Stieler itself 268The New Stielers Handatlas The exclusive use of the Greenwich meridian and of the metre for altitudes and depths in the new edition bears witness to the increasing unification of standards the world over Dr Wagner expresses his regret that altitudes have not been indicated more extensively As pointed out by Petermann in I86  when he first introduced their use altitude is as necessary to the true representation of geographic position as its companion ele ments latitude and longitude and should be indicated with the same degree of accuracy when possible Hence not only summits but also valleys and plains should bear altitude indications since altitude is almost meaninglessexcept by comparison with a datum point near by The artistic appearance of the published sheets is a triumph of copper engraving The clearness variety and delicacy of the re presentation of groundforms exhibit a degree of truthfulness and afford an esthetic enjoyment such as was unattainable with the black prints of former days and has not been equalled by the best products of lithography S ABORIGINAL POTTERY OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES W Hf Hvlines itn Lt 23h Annrzl Repjrt of the Bureau of Ethiowogy Pages 1237 z77 plates and 79 figures This is an archaeological study But before discussing the work itself it may be well to look into the status of archaeological research within the United States Owing to the fact that the area east of the Mississippi River has been thickly populated for many years and to a widespread and laudable interest in the subject specimens have accumulated to such a degree that there is sufficient accessible material for a general survey of the whole area The region west of the Mississippi lowlands north of Texas and east of the Rocky Mountains is scarcely represented in our collection The recent settlement of this area and the sparse population may be the cause but whether there are archaeological remains or not no one really knows West of the Rocky Mountains and in the Southwest exploration is constantly fruitful but is far behind the Eastern area Consequently a resume of the results attained in the bestknown area will be timely and stimulating To such a resum6 the present study of ceramic specimens is an important contribution The method of the author is to take up specimens of pottery 269

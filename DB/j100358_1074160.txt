J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074160,LITERARY STUDY AND CHARACTER FORMATION,I244525,LITERARY STUDY AND CHARACTER FORMATION THE METHOD BY WHICH TEACHERS OF LITERATURE MOST COMMONLY AND MOST NATURALLY GO TO WORK TO FORM CHARACTER IS THE EXTREMELY PRIMITIVE SCHEME OF DIRECT PREACHING TOO MANY OF US ARE NEVER HAPPY UNLESS WE ARE POINTING A MORAL WE DIN A SORT OF HOT HOUSE GOODNESS INTO THE EARS OF THE BOYS AND GIRLS UNTIL THEY LONG THOUGH PERHAPS THEY ARE NOT AWARE OF IT AND WOULD INDIG NANTLY AND SINCERELY DENY IT TO EXCHANGE THE LILIES AND LANGUORS OF VIRTUE FOR THE ROSES AND RAPTURES OF VICE SOME OF US IF I MAY SO SPEAK WOULD TRY TO GET ETHICAL BLOOD OUT OF A MORAL TURNIP WE FIND IN A PIECE OF BLASPHEMOUS IMPIETY LIKE BYRONS VISION OF JUDGMENT A NEW APOCALYPSE AND IN A SIMPLE LITTLE STORY LIKE THE GREAT STONE FACE A SYSTEM OF CONDUCT SO BEAUTIFUL AND SO COMPLETE THAT WE CANNOT SPEAK OF IT WITHOUT TEARS TO SAY NOTHING OF THOSE WHICH WE CAUSE OTHER PEOPLE TO SHED ALL THIS I AM FREE TO ADMIT IS CALCULATED TO PRODUCE A POWERFUL EFFECT UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER IT DOES NOT ALWAYS RESULT AS IS INTENDED OR DESIRED IF THE TEACHER IS OPERATING ON WHAT IS VULGARLY KNOWN AS THE GOODYGOODY BOY OR A SEDATE AND PIOUS MISS THE ETHICAL DAINTY IS RECEIVED AND CONSUMED WITH GRATEFUL DECORUM BUT IF THE SUBJECT IS UNREGENERATE OR IS EVEN FULL OF HIGH SPIRITS AND INCLINED AS ALL HEALTHYMINDED YOUNG PEOPLE ARE TO THINK HABITUALLY ABOUT FAR OTHER THINGS THAN MORAL PRINCIPLES SPIRITUAL NAUSEA IS PRETTY SURE TO FOLLOW THE PROVER BIAL WILDNESS AND FRIVOLITY OF THE MINISTERS CHILDREN ARE FAMILIAR ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE TRUTH OF THESE STATEMENTS IN OTHER WORDS FORMAL ETHICAL INSTRUCTION WHERE MORAL IMPROVEMENT IS NOT NEEDED IS MILDLY INNOCUOUS WHERE MORAL IMPROVEMENT IS DESIRABLE IN NINE CASES OUT OF TEN IT IS POSITIVELY DETRI MENTAL SOMETHING VERY MUCH LIKE THIS IS OBSERVABLE IN ALL THOSE CASES IN WHICH MEN TRY TO INFLUENCE OTHER MEN SHAKSPERE KNEW 285THE SCHOOL REVIEW IT WHEN HE MADE BRUTUS SPEECH FAIL AND ANTONYS SUCCEED POPE KNEW IT WHEN HE WROTE MEN MUST BE TAUGHT AS IF YOU TAUGHT THEM NOT THE OPERATION OF THE PRINCIPLE IN FACT IS NOT CONFINED TO THE SUB JECTIVE WORLD THE OCULIST IN SEEKING TO LEAD A RECALCITRANT MUSCLE BACK INTO THE PATHS OF VIRTUE DOES NOT RESTRAIN ITS VAGAR IES HE HUMORS THEM THE REASONS FOR THESE THINGS ARE TO BE SOUGHT AND FOUND DEEP IN THE STRUCTURE OF THE HUMAN MIND THERE ARE TWO SETS OF MEN TAL PHENOMENA TO WHICH THEY ARE DIRECTLY TRACEABLE FIRST THE INTERRELATION OF THE CONSCIOUS MIND AND THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND SECOND THE CONSEQUENT RELATION AS REGARDS CAUSE AND EFFECT OF THE MENTAL AND MORAL ACTIVITIES THE CONSCIOUS MIND IS THE INSTRUMENT WHICH PERFORMS ALL PURELY INTELLECTUAL OPERATIONS IT PERCEIVES IT WILLS IT REASONS THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND POSSESSES NONE OF THESE FACULTIES ITS ONE CHANNEL OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE OUTER WORLD IS THE CON SCIOUS MIND AS REGARDS THE PRESENT IT IS IN A SENSE IN BOND AGE AS REGARDS THE PAST HOWEVER IT IS FREE IT NEVER FORGETS THAT IS TO SAY THE IMPRESSIONS THAT IT RECEIVES ARE INEFFACEABLE ITS MAKEUP DEPENDS UPON THE WHOLE PAST HISTORY OF THE INDIVID UAL TO THIS MAKEUP OBVIOUSLY ARE DUE ALL WHIMS PREJUDICES AND TASTES WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO REFER TO THESE CONVENTIONALLY AS EMOTIONS BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT THEY ARE NOTHING MORE OR LESS THAN CRYSTALLIZED PERCEPTIONS JUDGMENTS AND DECISIONS THE SUM TOTAL OF THESE COMPONENTS OF THE SUBCONSCIOUS MIND CON STITUTE WHAT WE CALL CHARACTER THE OLD STATEMENT THAT CHARACTER IS WHAT A MAN IS IS NOT THEREFORE STRICTLY TRUE CHARACTER RATHER IS ALL THAT A MAN HAS THOUGHT WILLED AND SEEN IF THIS REASONING BE SOUND IT FOLLOWS THAT FINENESS OF FEELING AND HENCE FINENESS OF MORALS DEPEND ON FINENESS OF INTELLECT COM MON EXPERIENCE ATTESTS THE TRUTH OF THIS CONCLUSION IT IS IMPOS SIBLE TO CONCEIVE OF AN ALLWISE BEING WHO IS NOT ALSO ALLGOOD IN SO FAR AS ANY MAN IS A CRIMINAL JUST IN SO FAR IS HE A FOOL STUPIDITY LEADS TO OTHER CONSEQUENCES THAN IMMORALITY BUT ALL IMMORALITY IS THE RESULT OF STUPIDITY THE WAY TO ERADICATE SIN THEREFORE IS TO ERADICATE STUPIDITY IN OTHER WORDS THE 286LITERARY STUDY AND CHARACTER FORMATION SCIENTIFIC METHOD OF FORMING CHARACTER IS TO INCREASE THE SIZE AND THE QUALITY OF THE BRAIN THIS IDEA SHOULD PERMEATE AND SATURATE EVERY RECITATION IN LITERATURE FROM THE FIRST TO THE LAST IT OUGHT TO BE IN THE TEACH ERS MIND THERE IS NO PORTION OF THE WORK WHICH CANNOT BE MADE TO ASSIST IN THE CUMULATIVE RESULT THE STUDENT SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO SEE THINGS ACCURATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY TO SPEAK AND WRITE ACCURATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY AND TO JUDGE BOOKS ACCUR ATELY AND INDEPENDENTLY ACCURACY AND INDEPENDENCE THESE ARE THE GREAT WORDS NO MAN WHO ACTS HABITUALLY IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE PRINCIPLES FOR WHICH THEY STAND CAN BE WEAK HIS TASTES CANNOT GO ASTRAY HE MUST HATE THE FALSE AND LOVE THE TRUE HE WILL SEE LIFE STEADILY AND SEE IT WHOLE AS I HAVE ALREADY SAID THIS WORK MUST BEGIN WITH THE FOUN DATION THE MORAL IMPORTANCE OF INSISTING ON ABSOLUTE ACCURACY IN THE MECHANICAL DETAILS OF COMPOSITION WHICH IS AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THE STUDY OF LITERATURE AND OUGHT NEVER TO BE SEPARATED FROM IT CANNOT BE OVERESTIMATED THERE IS A SCHOOL OF PEDA GOGUES I AM AWARE AND IT IS NOT WITHOUT DISCIPLES WHO WOULD REVERSE THE GOOD AND SAFE OLD RULE TAKE CARE OF THE PENCE AND THE POUNDS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES I HAVE HEARD A MAN WHO STANDS HIGH IN EDUCATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY GRAVELY MAINTAIN THAT IF A STUDENT PUT IN A DASH WHENEVER THERE WAS A BREAK IN HIS THOUGHT THE REASONABLE REQUIREMENTS OF PUNCTUATION WOULD BE SATISFIED I TOLD HIM THAT IF SOME OF MY STUDENTS PUT IN A DASH WHEREVER THERE WAS A BREAK IN THEIR THOUGHTS THEIR COMPOSITIONS WOULD BE NOTHING BUT A SUCCESSION OF DASHES IF A MAN IS A SLIP SHOD SPELLER IT IS BECAUSE HE IS A SLIPSHOD THINKER AND IF HE IS A SLIPSHOD THINKER HE IS SURE TO ACT FROM HALF UNDERSTOOD AND HENCE INADEQUATE MORAL IDEALS BY CONSCIOUS AND PERSISTENT EFFORT THERE CAN BE CREATED IN THE STUDENT A STATE OF MIND SUCH THAT IF HE MISSPELLS A WORD OR MISPLACES A COMMA HE WILL BE AS UNHAPPY AS A FULL BACK WHO MISSES A TACKLE OR A CENTER FIELDER WHO MUFFS A FLY HE SHOULD BE TAUGHT THAT DERELICTION IN THESE RESPECTS IS TO THE INTELLECTUAL WHAT SOILED LINEN IS TO THE SOCIAL STATUS IF HE IS NOT SO TAUGHT THERE WILL BE NO FOUNDATION FOR THE FUTURE UPBUILDING OF HIS CHARACTER THROUGH THE MEDIUM OF LITERARY STUDY 287THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE FIRST THING THAT I SHOULD TRY TO TEACH AFTER REASONABLE PROGRESS HAD BEEN MADE IN THESE MECHANICAL MATTERS WOULD BE ACCURACY OF OBSERVATION IN REGARD TO NATURE MEN AND BOOKS I WOULD HAVE THE BOYS AND GIRLS AT AN EARLY POINT IN THE HIGH SCHOOL COURSE READ SOME COMPOSITION LIKE JOHN BURROUGHS SHARP EYES THE CHIEF PURPOSE OF THAT WORK BEING TO OPEN THEIR SENSES TO THE GREAT MASS OF COMMON THINGS ABOUT THEM WHICH THEY AND WE AND ALL PEOPLE ARE TOO APT TO LOOK AT WITHOUT SEEING FROM THE OBSERVATION OF THINGS I WOULD PASS TO THE OBSERVATION OF MEN TAKING AS A STARTING POINT SOME SUCH BOOK AS SILAS MARNER IN WHICH CHARACTER AND MOTIVES ARE CLEARLY AND KEENLY ANALYZED I WOULD END THESE EXERCISES IN OBSERVATION WITH A CRITICAL EXAMI NATION OF SOME MASTERPIECE PROBABLY THE MERCHANT OF VENICE ENDEAVORING TO GIVE MY PUPILS A SOUND AND DEFINITE STANDARD BY WHICH TO WEIGH ITS MERIT AND SO ESTABLISHING IN THEM THE HABIT OF JUDGING A BOOK NOT BY WHAT IS WRITTEN ABOUT IT BUT BY WHAT IS WRITTEN IN IT SOMETIMES I THINK THAT IF I WERE A LITERARY CZAR I WOULD ISSUE AN UKASE COMMANDING ALL BOOKS ABOUT BOOKS TO BE BURNED WITH A COROLLARY PROVIDING THAT ANYONE WHO SHOULD IN THE FUTURE WRITE A WORK OF LITERARY CRITICISM SHOULD BE HANGED IN SHORT I WOULD TRY TO CLEAR THE MINDS OF MY PUPILS OF CANT CANT ABOUT NATURE CANT ABOUT PEOPLE CANT ABOUT BOOKS I WOULD PLACE THEM UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SPLENDID SIMPLICITY AND STRAIGHT FORWARDNESS OF BURNS MACAULAYS GLORIOUS CANDOR AND THE PIERCING EAST WIND OF CARLYLES STERN MORAL VIGOR IN SUCH ATMOSPHERES SPIRITUAL MALARIA CANNOT EXIST MACAULAY TOO IS USEFUL FOR ANOTHER REASON IF THERE IS ONE VICE FROM WHICH HE IS FREE AND TO WHICH HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS ARE ADDICTED IT IS THE VICE OF SAYING ONE THING AND MEANING ANOTHER I HAVE HERE A COLLECTION OF STATEMENTS TAKEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES FROM THEIR COMPOSITIONS EACH PARTICULAR HAIR DID STAND ON END LIKE A FRETFUL PORCUPINE EACH KNOTTED AND COMBINED LOCK DID PART HORATIO HAD BEEN TO COLLEGE FROM WHICH WE MAY BELIEVE HE HAD AN INCOME WHILE AT COLLEGE HIS FATHER DIED HE BEGAN LIFE WHEN TWENTYTWO YEARS OLD CORIOLANUS OPENS ON A WELFARE IN ROME 288LITERARY STUDY AND CHARACTER FORMATION HE WAS BURIED IN THOUGHT ON THE BANKS OF THE RIVER BOSWELLS JOHNSON INCLUDES MANY ANTIDOTES OF HIS LIFE WHENEVER WORSTED IN ARGUMENT HE RESORTED TO LOGIC A QUEEN WOULD NOT HANG HER TWO HUSBANDS IN THE SAME ROOM TWELFTH NIGHT WAS WRITTEN BETWEEN 1599 AND I6OO THERE WERE NO CANNON IN HAMLETS DAY SHAKSPERE IS THERE FORE GUILTY OF AN ANACHRONISM WHEN HE MAKES HAMLET EXCLAIM O THAT THE EVERLASTING HAD NOT FIXD HIS CANON GAINST SELF SLAUGHTER A PERSON WHO IS CAPABLE OF MAKING MISTAKES OF THIS SORT CAN NOT IN ANY LARGE SENSE OF THE WORD BE CALLED MORAL HE CAN SEE NEITHER THE HUMOR NOR THE EQUITY OF THINGS YOU MAY PREACH TO HIM TILL DOOMSDAY YOU MAY WEEP AND ABUSE YOU MAY TELL HIM IN A HUNDRED THOUSAND WAYS TO SAY WHAT HE MEANS AND MEAN WHAT HE SAYS THE PROBABILITY IS THAT AFTER ALL THIS HE WILL WRITE AS BADLY AS BEFORE A THOROUGH STUDY OF ONE OF MACAU LAYS ESSAYS WILL DO MORE TO MAKE HIM DESPISE LOOSENESS OF LAN GUAGE AND OF LOGIC THAN ALL THE PRECEPTS IN THE RHETORICS HIS PRECISION HAS SUCH A FACE AND SUCH A MIEN AS TO BE LOVD NEEDS ONLY TO BE SEEN HE IS THE GREATEST OF ALL AWAKENERS OF AN ENTHUSIASM FOR CLEAR EXACT POLISHED MANLY UTTERANCE THE SALUTARY INFLUENCE OF GOOD EXAMPLES INDEED CAN SCARCELY BE OVERESTIMATED MAN IS ESSENTIALLY AN IMITATIVE ANIMAL WE ALL TRY TO BE WHAT WE ADMIRE FOR THESE REASONS GOOD BIOGRAPHY IS CALCULATED OFTENTIMES TO PERFORM FOR THE YOUNG STUDENT A SERV ICE WHICH IT WOULD BE VAIN TO EXPECT FROM ANY OTHER KIND OF LITERATURE MANY A WRITER HAS CONCEIVED A NOBLE IDEAL CHERISHED THROUGHOUT YEARS OF EARNEST AND SUCCESSFUL TOIL FROM A PERUSAL OF BOSWELLS JOHNSON MANY A SELFMADE MAN HAS CAUGHT HIS FIRST IMPULSE FROM THE PAGES OF FRANKLINS AUTOBIOGRAPHY MANY A SOLDIER WHO HAS RISEN HIGH ABOVE HIS FELLOWS CAN TRACE THE INCEPTION OF THE RESOLVE THAT LED HIM ONWARD AND UPWARD TO THE INSPIRATION THAT HE DRANK IN FROM THE OLD PLUTARCH WITH THE BAT TERED COVER THE GOVERNMENT AT WASHINGTON USED TO FURNISH EVERY OFFICER AND EVERY MAN IN THE AMERICAN NAVY WITH A COPY OF SOUTHEYS LIFE OF NELSON EXAMPLE IS GREATER THAN PRECEPT 289THE SCHOOL RR VITEW LIVES OF GREAT MEN ALL REMIND US WE CAN MAKE OUR LIVES SUBLIME IF WE SOW IN THE MIND OF A YOUNG MAN OR A YOUNG WOMAN THE SEED OF A NOBLE EXAMPLE AND DO NOT WATER THE GROUND TOO MUCH THE SUMMER WE MAY REST ASSURED WILL BRING FORTH FLOWERS AND THE AUTUMN FRUIT AND GRAIN I HAVE RESERVED UNTIL THE LAST THE DISCUSSION OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FAR REACHING CONSIDERATION OF ALLTHE FORMATION OF TASTE GOOD TASTE IS THE HIGHEST OF ALL MORAL QUALITIES AND FOR THIS REASON THE CULTIVATION OF IT SHOULD CONSTITUTE THE ULTIMATE AIM OF EDUCATION THE MAN WHO IS GOOD BECAUSE HE LIKES TO BE GOOD IS BETTER THAN THE MAN WHO IS GOOD BECAUSE HE THINKS HE OUGHT TO BE GOOD IF WILLIE ABSTAINS FROM SUNDAY BASEBALL BECAUSE IT GRIEVES MOTHER WHEN HE INDULGES IN IT HE IS APT WHEN MOTHER IS OUT OF TOWN TO FALL FROM GRACE BUT IF HE ABSTAINS BECAUSE THE EVIL SMELLS AND THE BAD LANGUAGE MAKE HIM SICK HE WILL TNEVER BACKSLIDE IF OUR PUPILS READ SHAKSPERE INSTEAD OF ARCHIBALD CLAVERING GUNTER BECAUSE WE TELL THEM THAT HAMLET IS BETTER THAN MR BARNES OF NEW YORK WE HAVE DOUBTLESS SCORED A POINT IF THEY STICK TO SHAKSPERE LONG ENOUGH THEY WILL BE CONVINCED THAT WE TELL THE TRUTH THE IF HOWEVER IS TOO LARGE THE IMPELLING FORCE MUST COME FROM WITHIN HOW CAN WE CREATE IN OUR PUPILS SUCH A FRAME OF MIND THAT THEY WOULD RATHER READ MILTON AND BURKE THAN JOSH BILLINGS AND ARTEMUS WARD  THE ACHIEVEMENT IS NO EASY ONE THERE ARE SEVERAL POPULAR WAYS OF NOT ACCOMPLISHING IT THE TEACHER WHO ADOPTS THE METHOD OF MINUTE LINGUISTIC STUDY AND THE TEACHER WHO ADOPTS THE DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSITE METHOD OF SENTIMENTAL GUSHING ARE GENERALLY UNSUCCESSFUL BOTH FAIL FOR THE SAME REASON NEITHER MAKES THE STUDENT UNDERSTAND HERE WE HAVE A PRECIOUS TRUTH DISLIKE IS MERELY A FORM OF IGNORANCE PEOPLE CANNOT HELP WORSHIPING MERIT WHEN THEY ACTUALLY REALIRE THAT IT IS MERIT IF YOU CAN LEAD YOUR PUPILS TO SEE EVEN IMPERFECTLY WHAT GOOD LITERATURE IS IF YOU CAN OPEN THEIR EYES TO ONE TENTH OF THE BEAUTY THE POWER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF IT ALL YOU NEED NOT WORRY MUCH ABOUT THEIR LIKING IT AND IN PROPORTION AS THEY LIKE IT THEIR MORALS WILL BE SAFE THEY WILL BE SO BUSY HELPING DAVID COPPERFIELD RUN AWAY FROM MR MURDSTONES BOTTLING WORKS THAT 290LITERARY STUDY AND CHARACTER FORMATION THEY WILL HAVE LESS TIME TO SMOKE CIGARETTES WITH TOM THE FASCINATION OF THE GREAT GAME THAT JULIUS CAESAR PLAYED IN GAUL WILL DIM THE JOY OF SURREPTITIOUS POKER WITH DICK EVEN THOSE SEDUCTIVE COON SONGS THAT HARRY SINGS SO WELL WILL LOSE SOME OF THEIR CHARM WHEN THE MOAN OF DOVES IN IMMEMORIAL ELMS AND MURMUR OF INNUMERABLE BEES HAVE CAUSED SUBTLER FIBERS IN THEIR SOULS TO VIBRATE THE CONCLUSION FROM ALL OF THESE FACTS IS SIMPLE AND IRRESIST IBLE THERE MUST BE NO SUCH THING AS MORAL INSTRUCTION AS SUCH WHATEVER ENLARGES REFINES AND STRENGTHENS THE BRAIN IS POWER FUL AND SALUTARY IN THE FORMATION OF CHARACTER THE ONLY SCIEN TIFIC WAY TO TEACH ETHICS IS TO TURN THE WHITE LIGHT OF TRUTH ON THE RELATIONS OF THINGS THE IDEA THAT BAD MEN ARE USUALLY SHARPER THAN GOOD MEN IS WORSE THAN ABSURDIT IS WICKED WE HAVE TOO MANY WORDS THEIR MULTIPLICITY FREQUENTLY MAKES US SEE THINGS DOUBLE AND TRIPLE SIN IS NOTHING BUT A FORM OF INSANITY THE CRIMINAL IS JUST A KIND OF FOOL STUPIDITY AND IMMORALITY ARE ONE THE HIGHEST WISDOM LIES IN BEING GOOD IF THESE IDEAS EVER COME TO PREVAIL IN EDUCATION I DO NOT PREDICT THAT THE WORLD WILL BE REGENERATED IN A DECADE BUT I HONESTLY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE SOUND USEFUL AND SUSCEPTIBLE OF APPLICATION IN ACTUAL PEDAGOGICAL WORK INDEED AS FAR AS I CAN SEE THEY MUST LIE AT THE BASE OF ALL THOROUGH AND TRULY SCIENTIFIC EFFORT TOWARD CHARACTER FORMATION EDWIN L MILLER ENGLEWOOD HIGH SCHOOL CHICAGO 29I

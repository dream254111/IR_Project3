read entitled  On the Reduction of the Thermo metrical Observations made at the Apartments of the Royal Society from the year 1774 to 1781 and from the year 1787 to 1843 By James Glaisher Esq of the Royal Observatory Greenwich Com municated by John Lee Esq LLD FRS c In this paper the author states that he has examined all the ther mometrical observations which have been made at the Apartments of the Royal Society with the view of ascertaining whether the diurnal variations at different epochs were in accordance with those which he had determined from the Greenwich observations and which are contained in his paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1848 The result of this investigation was that the corrections contained in the tables in his former paper were applicable to the observations of all the years since 1774 The author is led from these examinations to the conclusion 1st that the instruments used have been uniformly good 2ndly that the observations have been faithfully recorded as read from the instruments 3rdly that the readings have been taken with great care with respect to the times stated and lastly that the observations were wellworth the necessary labour of reduction He finds how ever that some of the more recent observations of the selfregister ing instruments are liable to some uncertaintyo Having satisfied himself that the observations were wellworth any amount of labour that might be bestowed on them the author was anxious to reduce them to a useful form but in consequence of the great amount of work that would be required for the reduction of so extensive a series he for some time hesitated to enter upon this labour Finding however that there was a demand for the re sults of trustworthy observations extending backwards many years and having besides the hope of connecting the Greenwich series of observations with these he determined to perform the work He states that the mean temperature of every month was determined in the first instance from the observations which had been made during the day and secondly from the observations of the selfregistering821 instruments Tables are appended to the paper showing the monthly quarterly and yearly mean temperatures with those of groups of years and other tables exhibiting the departure of every individual result from the mean of all The author concludes by stating that hitherto the mean tempera ture at Somerset House has been estimated a great deal too high lie does not here enter into the investigation as to whiether the tern perature as now determined is too high for the geographical position and elevation of Somerset House but proposes to do so in a paper he is preparing with the view of connecting the Somerset House with the Greenwich series and of bringing up all the results to the present time He hopes also at some future time to present results from the barometrical observations arranged in a similar manner May 10 1849 The EARL OF ROSSE President in the Chair The following communication was read Remarks on M De la Rives Theory for the Physical Explanation of the Causes which produce the Diurnal Variation of the Magnetic Declination in a letter to S Hunter Christie Esq Sec RS from LieutCol Sabine For SecRS Communicated by S Hunter Christie Esq MY DEAR SIR Woolwich April 16 1849 The Annales de Chmie et de Phlysique for March last contains a letter from M De la Rive to M Arago in which a theory is pro posed professing to explain on physical principles the general phenomena of the diurnal variation of the magnetic declination and in particular the phenomena observed at St Helena and at the Cape of Good Hope described in a paper communicated by me to the Royal Society in 1847 and whichl has been honoured with a place in the Philosophical Transactions Although I doubt not that the inadequacy of the theory proposed by M De la Rive for the solution of this interesting problem will be at once recognised by those who have carefully studied the facts which have become known to us by means of the exact methods of investigation adopted in the magnetic observatories of recent esta blishment yet there is danger that the names of De la Rive and Arago held in high and deserved estimation as authorities on such subjects attached to a theory which moreover claims reception on the ground of its accordance with wellascertained facts and with principles of physics positively established may operate prejudicially in checking the inquiries which may be in progress in other quarters into the causes which really occasion the phenomena in question I have thought it desirable therefore to point out in a very brief communication some of the important particulars in which M De la Rives theory fails to represent correctly the facts which it 2

MayJune 1902 ioo a Year Among the Sea Birds of the Oregon Coast BY WILLIAM L FINLEY BOUT forty miles south of the mouth of the Columbia River and two miles out from the entrance of Netarts Bay are three large rocks These are the homes of countless num bers of seabirds and as the bird life there had never been disturbed to any Netarts was one of interest to a bird crank because in the coast mountains we found breeding such birds as the varied thrush pileolated warbler Or egon jay Vaux swift pileated wood pecker western evening grosbeak and in the dwarfed shrubbery down by the PHOTO BY H T BOHLMAN THE BIRD ROCKS AT A DISTANCE extent we determined if possible to make a trip to the rocks and ascertain what species were breeding There were four in the party including Mr Herman T Bohlman who did the pho tographic work and myself The trip overland last year from Portland to seashore we found the wrentit We also saw a flock of crossbills but no sign of their nesting We reached the coast the last of May and spent the first two weeks of June at the seashore The weather was very unsettled at that time and it was rather 0 UMAY 1902 I THE CONDOR 55 a difficult problem to reach the rocks at all Our only method was by launch ing a boat in the surf and rowing out then the equal difficulty of landing and getting to the top of the rocks After waiting for about a week we were en abled to make two trips to the rocks Most of our observations were made on the rock furthest out at sea known as Shag Rock as it was the most accessible and larger than the others We as cended one of the other rocks but found the same species breeding there A couple of days at such a bird metropolis is a novel experience for a sented itself looking down the rocky slope up which we had come we counted hundreds of nests of Brandt cormorant scattered over the entire length every few feet apart To the north was a large slope of about 150 yards covered wita a rich growth of yellowflowered weeds among which many gulls had placed their nests The whole distance was perforated with the burrows of petrels and puffins The south side was a sheer precipice and hundreds of feet below the waves dashed against the granite foundation But their sound was lost in the ceaseless Aft Ft AIL PHOTO BY BOHLMAN BRANDT CORMORANTS NESTS FROM TOP OF ROCKS person one who has not been among the seabirds cannot imagine the sight that presents itself Our time was too short to make many observations of value or to secure a good series of pho tographs At every turn scenes of bird life that would have made interest ing pictures presented themselves but the difficulties in the way of success were almost as numerous When we reached the topmost point of Shag Rock an interesting sight pre cries of great numbers of seafowl that we had aroused by our presence They crowded about in the air circling over and darting past out heads watching every move we made It gave us a wierd feeling and we felt like getting out of the disputed territory Of the three species of cormorants we found on the rocks Brandt Phalacro corax penicillatus was by far the com monest The nests of the great colony on Shag Rock showed that they had56 THE CONDOR I Vol IV been there for along time They were built of grass on a foundation of guano and often over a foot high The re mains of fish were scattered about in all directions Baird cormorant Phala crocorax p resplendens was also found breeding along the more inaccessible places in the face of the cliff Its smaller size and the white flank patches easily served as a distinguish ing mark The third variety was the tail petrel Oceanodroma furcata com paratively common We sometimes found the two species breeding in the same burrows the latter were more in clined to live in small colonies and where one or two nests were found others were generally found near by This petrel is larger than the Leach petrel and easily distinguished by its light slatishgray plumage Some of these birds were found with fresh eggs 1 r  i t  Ij  1 1  ii            c i1   PHOTO BY BOHLMAN TUFTED PUFFIN AND NEST doublecrested cormorant Phalacro corax dilophus they were found on both the rocks we visited and were even more numerous than Baird cor morant In the burrows we found a great many tufted puffins Lunda cirrhala and Leach petrels Oceanodroma leucor hoa We managed to secure a good pic ture of an adult female of the former species on her nest by carefully un covering her burrow Besides the Leach petrel we found the forked others with young Sometimes the males were incubating and sometimes the females The California murre Uria troile cali fornica and the western gull Larus occi dentalis were both very common about the rocks The murres occupied every available place The two peaks of the second rock we climbed were occupied entirely by two great murre rookeries A good picture was secured of a colony of murres looking down from the top of Shag Rock The gulls were floatingMAY 1902 I THE CONDOR 57 about overhead continually ever ready to pounce down on some unprotected cormorants nest We observed one Baird cormorant that was scared from its nest No sooner had she gone than two gulls pounced down upon the va cated eggs and while one of the rob bers pierced two and devoured the con tents the other gull picked up the re maining egg in its bill and flew off to the adjacent rock There were a few pigeon guillemots Ceppihus columba about the rocks but not very many were found breeding there We noticed a number of pairs of black oystercatchers about the rocks but were only able to locate one nest The birds were flying back and forth continually uttering their whistling call The nest of this species that was found was on the south side of the rock on a little slope where the fine pieces of rock had fallen down from above The three eggs were placed without the least sign of a nest two of theni were near together while the other was about eight or ten inches be low All of the eggs were pipped and just about ready to hatch in the warm sun The parent birds were flying about the rock but did not come near the eggs Berkeley Cal

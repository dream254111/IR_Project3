FIRST TAK R May v Joynes 20 Gratt 692 Robertson v Hardy 23 S E 766 I SCOPE OF ARTICLE The purpose of this article is to enquire to what extent in Vir ginia a power of disposition may be given to a tenant for life or years so that it will not defeat a gift over in fee and further to notice some apparently contradictory rulings on the subject by the Supreme Court of Virginia I MAY V JOYNES 20 GRATT 692 The doctrine of this case is that where there is given a life estate but with full power to dispose of the fee by deed or will without limitation or restriction as to the time mode or purpose of its exercise the devisee will be held to take a feesimple by implication The clause of the will construed in this case was as follows  I give to my beloved and excellent wife subject to the provisions hereafter declared my whole estate real and personal and especially all real estate which I may hereafter acquire to her during her life but with full power to make sale of any part of the said estate and to convey absolute titles tc the purchasers and use the purchase money for investment or any purpose that she pleases with only this restriction that whatever remains at her death shall after paying any debts she may owe or any legacies that she may leave be divided as follows among his children and grandchildren J It will be seen by giving attention to this case that it was a case in which the power of disposition of the fee was conferred in the broadest and most unrestricted terms possible There were no limitations no restrictions of any kind but it was provided that if she should not sell or give it all away then what was so undis posed of should go as directed It is important to note this in the outset for as we shall presently see if limitations or conditions or contingencies are mentioned wholly different principles Qught ta apply706 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb Professor Graves of the University of Virginia says the doc trine that when a life estate is given to the devisee with power of disposition the devisee is held to take a feesimple if otherwise the manifest intention of the will would be defeated is by way of ex ception to the general rule the general rule being that when an express estate for life is given and a power of disposition is an nexed the devisee for life will not take an estate in fee notwith standing the power to dispose of the inheritance An illustration of this doctrine is found in Rubey v Barnett2 where the clause of the will was First my will is that my beloved wife Polly Horn have all my estate both real and personal so long as she may live Secondly my will is that my wife dispose of all said estate as she may think most advisable at her death Here it will be seen that the particularity of time is all that keeps this case from measuring up to the standard of May v Joynes But May v Joynes has a much narrower application than is sometimes supposedand even the Supreme Court of Virginia seems to have gone astray in the cases hereafter mentioned Things merely alike are not the same and accurate discrimination is here needed It may be remarked that there was probably no good reason why the court should have reached the conclusion it did in May v Joynes In Smnith v Bell3 the will read Also I give to my wife Elizabeth Goodwin all my personal estate what soever and wheresoever and of what nature kind and quality soever after payment of my debts legacies and funeral expenses which personal estate I give and bequeath unto my said wife Elizabeth Goodwin to and for her own use and benefit and disposal absolutely the rnemainder of the said estate after her decease to be for the use of the said Jesse Goodwin This case was decided by Chief Justice Marshall and it was held that the wife took only a life estate in the property and that Jesse took a vested remainder If the same judge had decided Mlay v Joynes we may with some degree of certainty say that the decision of the case would have been different from what it was Be that as it may the Virginia court has after this long lapse of time without questioning May v Joynes estopped itself from questioning the correctness of the decision We have seen that the decision in May v Joynes according to Professor Graves is an exception to the 13 Va Law Reg 65 66 212 Mo 3 49 Am Dec 112 and note 3 6 Peters 681903 GIFT OVER AFTER POWER OF DISPOSITION 707 general rulewe have seen that it is decided contrary to what Chief Justice Marshall would have decided itit therefore seems that there might be some reason for confining the doctrine strictly with in its original limits There are quite a number of cases in Vir ginia following and reaffirming the doctrine of May v Joynes4 It is apparent then that under May v Joynes properly under stood the gift over will be sustained unless coupled with the life estate there is an unlimited power of disposition An unlimited power of disposition being defined to be a power to give as one pieases for what one pleases at any time one pleases without refer ence to anyones intention or wish in the premises III MILLER V POTTERFIELD 86 VA 876 The case of Miller v Potterfield establishes the exception above contended for to the doctrine of May v Joynes The clause of the will was as follows  I give and bequeath to my beloved wife Elizabeth Miller all my property both real and personal to have and to hold the same for her own use and benefit and also to make such disposition of the same that she in her judgment may deem best should it become necessary that a part or all should become necessary for the support of herself and William Garrett who I desire should remain with her during her lifetime and have such care and attention given him as he may need After the death of the said Elizabeth Miller I will and desire that any and all property remaining unuwed shall be given to the said William Garrett to have and to use for his own benefit or to make such disposition of as may be deemed best for his interest This case does not measure up to the standard of May v Joynes for the disposition of th6 property was only to be made on a con dition or contingency namely the requirement of it for the support of testators wife and William Garrett This case has never been overruled in Virginia and is authority for the proposition that if all of the property may be disposed of but only on the occurrence of a certain event it is not an unlimited power of disposition such as is required to defeat the gift over This case is at one extreme and May v Joynes at the other The former is the case where the disposition of the whole is allowed and upon no designated contingency but the latter is the case where the whole may be disposed of but only upon one named contingency Now there may be intermediate casescases where the disposi 4Some of them are Cole v Cole 79 Va 251 Carr v Effinger 78 Va 197 Hall v Palmer 87 Va S54 Bowen v Bowen 87 Va 438 Farish v Wayman 91 Va 430 Rob ertson v Hardy 23 S E 766708 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb tion of the whole is allowed on more than one contingency or upon several concurrent or cumulative conditions What shall be done with this class of cases Since they apparently come strictly under neither the doctrine of May v Joynes nor Miller v Potter field shall one or the other doctrine be extended so as to include these cases or shall a new class be made A moments reflection will show that the cases belong strictly to one or the other class above named There is no middle ground Either the socalled life tenant takes a feesimple or an absolute estate as the case may be or else he is in strictness what he is calleda life tenant merely Since May v Joynes is an exception to the general ruleand re quires an unlimited power of disposition in order to bring a case within its scopewe conclude that all cases in which the power of disposition is to be exercised upon conditions or contingenciesit matters not how many so they be not so numerous as to really make the power absolute or unlimitedthe estate in remainder is good if the subject matter is not disposed of upon the occurrence of the condition or conditions IV THE RULINGS ON THE SUBJECT IN VIRGINIA Beginning with Madden v Madden5 we shall examine some of the Virginia cases on the subject In this case the testator provided that All my movaeble property    after the death of my wife shall be sold and the proceeds thereof equally divided among my five daugh ters    after all my just debts age paid my desire is that all my movaeble property shall be at the entire dsposal of my uife on her decease the same to be disposed as above mentioned It was held that the wife took only a life estate in such of the mzoveables as were capable of being used and returned in kind In Burwell v Anderson the will read  I desire that my wife Elizabeth Pasteur may have and possess during her life all the rest and residue of my estate whether real or personal And after her death my will and desire is that all my estate both real and personal shall be turned into money by the most advantageous sale which my executors can make of it and the amount thereof distributed in manner following viz I de sire my wife by her will or otherwise as she pleases may have the absolute dis posal of 500 thereof I give my nephew William Pasteur to be paid him when he attains to the age of twentyone years the sum of 200 sterling other part 5 2 Leigh 377 The preceding cases are Shermer v Shermer 1 Wash 266 and Rid dick v Cohoon 4 Rand 547 6 3 Leigh 3481903 GIFT OVER AFTER POWER OF DISPOSITION 709 thereof And it is my will and desire after deducting the two last mnentioned sums that two thirds of the residue be paid to my niece Anne Smith for her own use and the remaining third to my friend Nathaniel Burwell for the use and benefit of my sister Ann Craig to be always at her disposal in such manner that her husband Thomas Craig and his creditors may have no power over it I give to my wife the absolute property in my chariot It is my will and desire that if the estate hereby before directed to be sold for the payment of my debts should not prove sufficient for that purpose whatever sum my other estate shall be called upon to make up shall be deducted in equal proportions according to the sums devised in money to my wife to my nephew to my niece and to iny sister as aforesaid It was held that the wife took by the will the absolute property in the 500 bequeathed to her and not a mere power to dispose of the sum In Melson v Cooper7 the devise was  I give to my son William Cooper the plantation I live on to him and hit heirs forever In case he should die without a son and not sell the land I give the land to my son George and if he should die under age then the land to be sold by John Herbert and divide the money among all my children then alive or their children that may be alive at that time It was held that the devise gave William absolute power to sell the feesimple and therefore whether he sold it or notl he took a fee simple and the devise over to George was void In Dunbar v Woodcock8 the devise and bequest were as follows I leave the use of all the rest residue and remainder of my estate real per sonal or mixed to my well beloved wife Frances Woodcock during her natural life and after her death I give and bequeath the same of every description as well the land I bought of John Acre as all the other property remaining at her deease to my friend Robert Dunbar and Hannah his wife and their joint heirs forever It was held that the will gave the legatee for life no absolute power of disposal of any part of the personal property and as to all of it the limitation over in remainder was good and effectual In Brown v George9 the will read To my daughter Anne B George for her sole and separate use the said interest or parts of the said estate to pass and go on the terms and in the manner following viz The portion of the said estate hereby appointed to my daughter to go to herfor life to her sole and separate use free from all caims or demands of her husband and the said estate or so much thereof as may be in ezi8tence at ker death to go to her children or their descendants if any there be It was held that the wife was entitled to use both principal and interest of the estate at her discretion 7 4 Leigh 408 810 Leigh 60 9 6 Gratt 424710 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb In Sprinkcle v Hayworth0 the testator entered into an agreement with his wife by which their property was to go at the death of either party to the survivor and at the death of the survivor it should be equally divided between his and her heirs and next of kin The testator made a will by which he gave all his property real and personal to his wife absolutely He died in her lifetime and she the next day died The court proceeded to say that if it appeared from the evidence in the case that the testator intended that his wife should have entire control of the whole property dur ing her life and use as much of it as she chose to use and that only what remained of it at her death was to be divided between his and her heirs and next of kin the trust would not be enforced etc In Missionary Society v Calvert the testator among other things said I wish the Proceeds of the Sales of My Real and Personal Estate and the Debts due to Me after paying My Debts to be Put at Interest By My Executors and My Wife to Receive the Interest But so Long as she remains My Widow she is to Be at Liberty to Receive From My Executors or From My Estate 8uh Part of it as she May chose and to appropriate it as 8he Believes to Be Just and Rite But such Part of it as She May not thus appropriate is to Pass as Directed By My Will at the Death of My Wife all the Remainder of My Estate Real and Per sonal shall Be Given and paid over to the Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal church Incorporated by an act of the Legislature of the State of New York passes April 9 1839 and the receipt of the treasurer of the society shall Be a sufficient Discharge therefor to My Executors etc It was held that as the testators wife was at liberty to receive from his executors such part of the estate as she might choose and appropriate it as she believed to be just and right all the estate directed to be sold and invested by his executors passed absolutely to his wife In Carr v Effinger2 the testator gave an annuity of 100 to his mother to be paid out of the money arising from the bonds due me He then provided as follows  What money or bonds I have in possession or judgment due me I leave unto my beloved wife to be collected should she think it best and vested in Confederate bonds or loaned out at interest out of the interest thus arising my wife is to pay my mother the 100 annually so long as my mother shall live and the remainder of the interest thus arising is to be used by my wife for her own 1026 Gratt 384 1132 Gratt 357 12 78 Va 1971903 GIFT OVER AFTER POWER OF DISPOSITION 711 benefit I also leave to my wife five shares of stock in the 0 A R R which she is to sell at such time as she may think proper and invest the proceeds in Confederate bonds or loan it out at interest for her benefit At the death of my wife what bonds she may not have used I give to my two sisters C T and L E and the children of their bodies It was held that the wife took an absolute estate charged with the annuity to the mother In Cole v Colel3 the testator said I give to my wife all my estate during her lifetime and at her death her half of the real estate and half of the personal property that may be on hand to do with as she may see proper and the other half of my real estate and personal property to go to the heirs of my brother Held that the words that may be on hand fairly construed impliedly give to the wife the absolute disposal of the personalty at least and the limitation over to the heirs of the brother is re pugnant and void In Randolph v Wright14 the testatrix gave all of her property to her two sons P and E By a codicil she said  Should either son die without a will or lawful issue the surviving son must heir all the property given by me to him E died without lawful issue and without a will It was con tended that E took a feesimple but it was held that E took a defeasible fee coupled with a power of appointment by will with remainder over to P and that the defeasible fee estate having been defeated by death without issue and without appointment by will the remainder to P is good In Johns v Johns the testator said I will and desire that my wife Rebecca shall have and hold all my estate during her natural life for the benefit of herself and children to be used as she May think proper It was held that the wife took only a life estate and that the power given was only over the life estate In Miller v Potterfiedld the clause of the will and the construc tion adopted have already been noted7 In Hall v Palmer8 the testator said I bequeath to my five daughters    two thirds of my estate to be equally divided between them and afterwards that the interest of two of 18 79 Va 251 14 81 Va 608 15 86 Va 333 16 86 Va

if any to their children Held that the two daughters took an estate in feesimple abso lute and the limitation over was void for repugnancy In Bowen v Bowen19 the clause of the will was as follows After the payment of all my just debts I give devise and bequeath to my wife Adeline Bowen all my estate real personal and mixed for and during her life and it is my wish and desire that my said wife may sell and convey my real estate and receive the purchase money therefor sell and use all my personal property and buy and sell with the proceeds such property for her own use and convenience as she may choose uithout accountability to any person whatsoever In fact during the life of my said wife I wish her to possess and enjoy the said property as if she enjoyed a feesimple and absolute estate therein If however at the death of my wife any of the said prcperty 811A remain I wish the same to be divided equally between all my nephews and nieces who may be living etc Here it was held that the wife took a feesimple in the realty and an absolute estate in the personalty In Smythe v Smythe20 the testator bequeathed his estate to his two sisters for their lives with power to sell if they deemed it de sirable but desired them to reinvest or loan the proceeds in some safe manner and avoid consuming the principal and at the death or marriage of both any property remaining to go to his adopted son Held the bequest gave the sisters no absolute feesimple but only a life estate with a valid limitation over to the adopted son In Farish v Wayman 21 the will read  I give to my brother William Redd and my brotherinlaw James A Gol bert one share of my real estate to be held by them in trust and for the benefit of my niece Agnes Priscilla Redd daughter of my brother James A Redd during the natural life of said Agnes Priscilla Redd and should the said Agnes Priscilla Redd die and leave no children in that case the property devised above or what may remain of the same I give to

as to the personal property only It was held that in this the wife took an absolute estate V COMMENT For practical purposes it may be said that the cases thus noticed comprise the law of our subject in Virginia But what do these cases show Examine for a moment and it will be seen that some of them are like May v Joynes and some of them are not The most of the cases we have examined above we are frank to admit are properly ruled by May v Joynes Johns v Johns23 was a case where no power was given except over the life estate In Mlfiller v Potterfield2 May v Joynes was not followed or rather the case was distinguished on the ground that the power of disposition was not absolute in the first taker for her sole benefit but of a named beneficiary25 In Smythe v Smythe28 this idea prevailed and the case was construed to be different from May v Joynes Then came the case of Farish v Wayman in which the court applied the doc trine of May v Joynes and citing most of the Virginia cases on the subject held that the limitation over was void With this de cision we are not disposed to disagree though Judge Burks finds fault with it2 The language certainly seems to be very broad But then in the next caseRobertson v IHardy29the court seems in our humble opinion to have gone completely beyond the mark In this case where the personal property was given to the wife for the benefit of her and my three youngest children for their support and education etc and if remainder gift over The court held that the wife took the whole absolutely And what is worse without mentioning Miller v Potterfield30 which could scarcely be more exactly like the case under consideration than it is and in which an opposite conclusion was reached But Robert son v Hardy3 was decided so the opinion stated upon the author ity of Farish v Wayman32 and that in turn upon May v Joynes So that the real situation is that Robertson v Hardy was decided 23 86 Va 333 24 86 Va 876 25 Bowen v Bowen supra Opinion by Lacy J 26 90 Va 638 27 91 Va 430 28 1 Va Law Reg 214 and note 9 23 S E 766 3 86 Va 876 31 f9pra 32 upra714 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb upon the authority of May v Joynes But in May v Joynes as is conceded there was an absolute power of disposition But in Rob ertson v Hardy the property was given to the wife for her bene fit conjointly with that of the children and to be disposed of on only one conditionnamely that it should become necessary for their support and education How far the court missed its mark will thus be apparent for it cannot be supposed that the power of disposition thus hedged about is the absolute power of disposition spoken of in May v Joynes And thus the matter stands in Virginia today Apparently if the first taker can on any contingency dispose of the property the remainder over is void But such cannot be the law And it may with confidence be predicted that when the case of Robertson v Hardy arises again it will be decided the other way and Robertson v Hardy will be overruled33 Wilburn Va LANDON C BELL 33 The fact that this case has neverbeen offlcially reported would seem to indicate some doubt in the minds of the court as to the correctness of the decision

FIRST TAK R MAY V JOYNES 20 GRATT 692 ROBERTSON V HARDY 23 S E 766 I SCOPE OF ARTICLE THE PURPOSE OF THIS ARTICLE IS TO ENQUIRE TO WHAT EXTENT IN VIR GINIA A POWER OF DISPOSITION MAY BE GIVEN TO A TENANT FOR LIFE OR YEARS SO THAT IT WILL NOT DEFEAT A GIFT OVER IN FEE AND FURTHER TO NOTICE SOME APPARENTLY CONTRADICTORY RULINGS ON THE SUBJECT BY THE SUPREME COURT OF VIRGINIA I MAY V JOYNES 20 GRATT 692 THE DOCTRINE OF THIS CASE IS THAT WHERE THERE IS GIVEN A LIFE ESTATE BUT WITH FULL POWER TO DISPOSE OF THE FEE BY DEED OR WILL WITHOUT LIMITATION OR RESTRICTION AS TO THE TIME MODE OR PURPOSE OF ITS EXERCISE THE DEVISEE WILL BE HELD TO TAKE A FEESIMPLE BY IMPLICATION THE CLAUSE OF THE WILL CONSTRUED IN THIS CASE WAS AS FOLLOWS  I GIVE TO MY BELOVED AND EXCELLENT WIFE SUBJECT TO THE

SHALL AFTER PAYING ANY DEBTS SHE MAY OWE OR ANY LEGACIES THAT SHE MAY LEAVE BE DIVIDED AS FOLLOWS AMONG HIS CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN J IT WILL BE SEEN BY GIVING ATTENTION TO THIS CASE THAT IT WAS A CASE IN WHICH THE POWER OF DISPOSITION OF THE FEE WAS CONFERRED IN THE BROADEST AND MOST UNRESTRICTED TERMS POSSIBLE THERE WERE NO LIMITATIONS NO RESTRICTIONS OF ANY KIND BUT IT WAS PROVIDED THAT IF SHE SHOULD NOT SELL OR GIVE IT ALL AWAY THEN WHAT WAS SO UNDIS POSED OF SHOULD GO AS DIRECTED IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THIS IN THE OUTSET FOR AS WE SHALL PRESENTLY SEE IF LIMITATIONS OR CONDITIONS OR CONTINGENCIES ARE MENTIONED WHOLLY DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES QUGHT TA APPLY706 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER FEB PROFESSOR GRAVES OF THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SAYS THE DOC TRINE THAT WHEN A LIFE ESTATE IS GIVEN TO THE DEVISEE WITH POWER OF DISPOSITION THE DEVISEE IS HELD TO TAKE A FEESIMPLE IF OTHERWISE THE MANIFEST INTENTION OF THE WILL WOULD BE DEFEATED IS BY WAY OF EX CEPTION TO THE GENERAL RULE THE GENERAL RULE BEING THAT WHEN AN EXPRESS ESTATE FOR LIFE IS GIVEN AND A POWER OF DISPOSITION IS AN NEXED THE DEVISEE FOR LIFE WILL NOT TAKE AN ESTATE IN FEE NOTWITH STANDING THE POWER TO DISPOSE OF THE INHERITANCE AN ILLUSTRATION OF THIS DOCTRINE IS FOUND IN RUBEY V BARNETT2 WHERE THE CLAUSE OF THE WILL WAS FIRST MY WILL IS THAT MY BELOVED WIFE POLLY HORN HAVE ALL MY ESTATE BOTH REAL AND PERSONAL SO LONG AS SHE MAY LIVE SECONDLY MY WILL IS THAT MY WIFE DISPOSE OF ALL SAID ESTATE AS SHE MAY THINK MOST ADVISABLE AT HER DEATH HERE IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE PARTICULARITY OF TIME IS ALL THAT KEEPS THIS

LIFE ESTATE IN THE PROPERTY AND THAT JESSE TOOK A VESTED REMAINDER IF THE SAME JUDGE HAD DECIDED MLAY V JOYNES WE MAY WITH SOME DEGREE OF CERTAINTY SAY THAT THE DECISION OF THE CASE WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT WAS BE THAT AS IT MAY THE VIRGINIA COURT HAS AFTER THIS LONG LAPSE OF TIME WITHOUT QUESTIONING MAY V JOYNES ESTOPPED ITSELF FROM QUESTIONING THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DECISION WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE DECISION IN MAY V JOYNES ACCORDING TO PROFESSOR GRAVES IS AN EXCEPTION TO THE 13 VA LAW REG 65 66 212 MO 3 49 AM DEC 112 AND NOTE 3 6 PETERS 681903 GIFT OVER AFTER POWER OF

FRANK TO ADMIT ARE PROPERLY RULED BY MAY V JOYNES JOHNS V JOHNS23 WAS A CASE WHERE NO POWER WAS GIVEN EXCEPT OVER THE LIFE ESTATE IN MLFILLER V POTTERFIELD2 MAY V JOYNES WAS NOT FOLLOWED OR RATHER THE

ONLY ONE CONDITIONNAMELY THAT IT SHOULD BECOME NECESSARY FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND EDUCATION HOW FAR THE COURT MISSED ITS MARK WILL THUS BE APPARENT FOR IT CANNOT BE SUPPOSED THAT THE POWER OF DISPOSITION THUS HEDGED ABOUT IS THE ABSOLUTE POWER OF DISPOSITION SPOKEN OF IN MAY V JOYNES AND THUS THE MATTER STANDS IN VIRGINIA TODAY APPARENTLY IF THE FIRST TAKER CAN ON ANY CONTINGENCY DISPOSE OF THE PROPERTY THE REMAINDER OVER IS VOID BUT SUCH CANNOT BE THE LAW AND IT MAY WITH CONFIDENCE BE PREDICTED THAT WHEN THE CASE OF ROBERTSON V HARDY ARISES AGAIN IT WILL BE DECIDED THE OTHER WAY AND ROBERTSON V HARDY WILL BE OVERRULED33 WILBURN VA LANDON C BELL 33 THE FACT THAT THIS CASE HAS NEVERBEEN OFFLCIALLY REPORTED WOULD SEEM TO INDICATE SOME DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF THE COURT AS TO THE CORRECTNESS OF THE DECISION

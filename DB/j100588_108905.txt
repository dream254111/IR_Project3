BY HENRY E ROSCOE BA FRS RECEIVED NOVEMBER 20READ DECEMBER 19 1867 I INTRODUCTION AMONGST THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES WHICH POINT OUT THE GENERAL RELATIONSHIP AND CLASSIFICA TION OF CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES NONE HAS SO DESERVEDLY OBTAINED THE CONFIDENCE OF CHEMISTS AS ISOMORPHISM THE VANADIUM COMPOUNDS HAVE HOWEVER PROVED A REMARKABLE AND UNEXPLAINED EXCEPTION TO THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH GENERALLY FOLLOW FROM WELLASCERTAINED IDENTITY OF CRYSTALLINE FORM RAMMEILSBERG AND AFTERWARDS MORE COMPLETELY SCHABUST POINTED OUT THE FACT THAT THE MINERAL VANADINITE FROM SEVERAL LOCALITIES A COMPOUND OF LEAD VANADATE AND LEAD CHLORIDE IS ISOMORPHOUS WITH APATITE PYROMORPHITE AND MIMETESITE MINERALS CONSISTING OF CALCIUM PHOSPHATOFLUORIDE LEAD PHOSPHATOCHLORIDE AND LEAD ARSENATOCHLORIDE HAVING THE FORMULAE 3CA3 P2 08 CA F12 3PB3 P2 08  PB C12 AND 3PB3 AS2 08  PB C12 THE CRYSTALLINE FORM OF ALL THESE MINERALS IS AN HEXAGONAL PRISM TERMINATED BY 6SIDED PYRAMIDS THE ANGLE P P TERMINAL FOUND BY RAMMELSBERG FOR VANADINITE AND BY DIFFERENT OBSERVERS FOR THE OTHER MINERALS IS AS FOLLOWS 1 VANLADINITE  142 30 3 PYROMORPHITE  142 15 2 APATITE   1420 20 4 MIMETESITE   142 7 AND THE RELATION OF THE AXES 1 1

BRITISH MINERALOGY PP 409410 1858 MDCCCLXVIII B2 PROFESSOR ROSCOES RESEARCHES ON VANADIUM WE ARE INDEBTED TO THE RESEARCHES OF BERZELIUS FOR ALMOST ALL WE KNOW CONCERNING THE CHEMICAL RELATIONS AND COMPOSITION OF VANADIUM AND ITS COMPOUNDS FROM HIS CELEBRATED INVESTIGATION ON VANADIUM 1831 THE RESULTS OF WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY CONFIRMED BY SCHAFARIKT AND CZUDNOWICZ IT APPEARS THAT THE FORMULA OF VANADIC ACID IS V 03 HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT WE HAVE HERE TO DO WITH EITHER A CASE OF DISSIMILARLY CONSTITUTED SUBSTANCES ACTING AS ISOMORPHOUS BODIES AND CRYSTALLIZING TOGETHER OR ELSE THE CONCLUSIONS OF BERZELIUS ARE ERRONEOUS AND THE TRUE FORMULA OF VANADIC ACID IS V2 05 CORRESPONDING TO THE PENTOXIDES OF PHOSPHORUS AND ARSENIC THE FIRST OF THESE ALTERNATIVES HAS BEEN PROPERLY ACCEPTED BY MOST CHEMISTS AS THE ONLY PRESENT SOLUTION OF THE DIFFICULTY INASMUCH AS THE DEFINITE EXPERIMENTAL DATA GIVEN BY BERZELIUS RENDER THE ASSUMPTION OF ANY OTHER FORMULA BUT V 03 FOR VANADIC ACID PERFECTLY GRATUI TOUS IN THE ABSENCE OF EXPERIMENTS PROVING THESE DATA TO BE ERRONEOUS BERZELIUS BASED HIS CONCLUSIONS ON THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS VIZ 1 THE CONSTANT LOSS OF WEIGHT WHICH VANADIC ACID UNDERGOES ON REDUCTION IN HYDROGEN AT A RED HEAT 2 THE ACTION OF CHLORINE ON THIS REDUCED OXIDE WHEN A VOLATILE CHLORIDE IS FORMED AND A RESIDUE OF VANADIC ACID REMAINS WHICH IS FOUND TO BE EXACTLY ONETHIRD OF THE QUANTITY ORIGINALLY TAKEN FOR REDUCTION IN HYDROGEN HENCE BERZELIUS CONCLUDES THAT THE NUMBER OF ATOMS OF OXYGEN IN THE OXIDE IS TO THAT IN THE ACID IN THE PROPORTION OF 1 TO 3 SO THAT ASSUMING THE LOWEST OXIDE TO CONTAIN ONE ATOM OF OXYGEN THE ACID CONTAINS THREE ATOMS A RESULT WHICH BERZELIUS FINDS BORNE OUT BY ITS CAPACITY OF SATURA TION THE QUESTION WHETHER THE ACID CONTAINS ONE OR TWO ATOMS OF METAL BERZELIUS DECIDES IN FAVOUR OF THE FORMER VIEW BY FINDING THAT NO COMPOUND CORRESPONDING TO THE ALUMS IS FORMED WHEN VANADIC ACID IS BROUGHT TOGETHER WITH SULPHURIC ACID AND POTASH THE ANALYSES OF THE VOLATILE CHLORIDE MADE BOTH BY BERZELJUS AND SCHAFARIK CONFIRM THIS CONCLUSION AND PLACE BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE FACT THAT IF THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANA DIUM BE TAKEN TO BE 68 5 AND 0 8 THE FORMULA OF VANADIC ACID IS V 03 THAT OF THE OXIDE PREPARED BY REDUCTION V 0 AND THAT OF THE CHLORIDE V C13 IN THE PRESENT COMMUNICATION I SHALL SHOW THAT WHILST CONFIRMING THESE FUNDAMENTAL RESULTS IN EVERY PARTICULAR I STILL ARRIVE AT A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CONCLUSION FROM BERZELIUS RESPECTING THE CONSTITUTION OF VANADIC ACID AND ALL THE OTHER VANADIUM COMPOUNDS FOR I SHALL PROVE THAT THE TRUE FORMULA OF VANADIC ACID IS V2 05 WHEN 0 16 AND THE TRUE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM 513 INASMUCH AS THE SUBSTANCE SUPPOSED BY BERZELIUS TO BE VANADIUM IS NOT THE METAL BUT AN OXIDE WITH AN ATOMIC WEIGHT OF 673 NEARLY THAT OF BERZELIUSS METAL WHILST THE SUPPOSED TERCHLORIDE IS AN OXYCHLORIDE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH I BASE MY CONCLUSIONS THE EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS ARE CONTAINED IN THE SEQUEL 1 AN OXIDE OF VANADIUM EXISTS WHICH UNITES WITH THREE ATOMS OF OXYGEN TO FORM VANADIC ACID HENCE THIS LATTER SUBSTANCE MUST CONTAIN MORE THAN THREE

CL3 II OCC1RJENCE AND PREPARATION OF THE VANADIUM COMPOUNDS 1 THE SOURCES OF VANADIUM ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS HAVE UP TO THE PRESENT TIME YIELDED THE COMPOUNDS OF THIS METAL IN SUCH EXTREMELY SMALL QUANTITIES THAT VANADIUM SALTS MAY STILL BE COUNTED AMONGST THE GREATEST OF CHEMICAL RARITIES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SATIS FACTORY INVESTIGATION OF THEIR PROPERTIES HAS PROVED SO DIFFICULT THAT CONTRADICTORY STATE MENTS CONCERNING EVEN FUNDAMENTAL POINTS ARE MADE BY RECENT EXPERIMENTERS MY ATTENTION WAS DIRECTED SOME TIME AGO TO THE OCCURRENCE OF VANADIUM IN SOME OF THE COPPERBEARING BEDS OF THE LOWER KEUPER SANDSTONE OF THE TRIAS WORKED AT ALDERLEY EDGE AND MOTTRAM ST ANDREWS IN CHESHIRE AND I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO SECURE A PLENTIFUL SUPPLY OF THIS RARE METAL BY THE PURCHASE OF A LIME PRECIPITATE CONTAINING VANADIUM WHICH HAD BEEN OBTAINED AS A RESIDUE IN THE EXTRACTION OF COBALT FROM THE COBALTBED SANDSTONE AT MOTTRAM BY THE ALDERLEY EDGE COPPER MINING COMPANY THE GEOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE REMARKABLE DEPOSIT OF METALLIC SALTS WHICH OCCURS IN THIS KEUPER SANDSTONE HAVE BEEN WELL DESCRIBED BY MR HULL THE HORIZONTAL BEDS OF SANDSTONE CONTAIN COPPER AS BLUE AND GREEN CARBONATES LEAD BOTH AS CARBONATE AND AS GALENA COBALT AS BLACK COBALTOCHRE AND IRON OXIDES ALL IN WORKABLE QUANTITIES TOGETHER WITH ARSENIC SILVER MANGANESE AS DIOXIDE AND BARIUM AS HEAVY SPAR THE SANDSTONE IS OF A SOFT AND UNIFORM TEXTURE AND IS METALLIFEROUS TO A DEPTH OF AT LEAST 60 FEET IT IS COLOURED VARIOUSLY FROM GREEN AND BROWN TO BLACK ACCORDING TO THE NATURE OF THE COVERING OF METALLIC ORE WHICH SURROUNDS THE GRAINS OF SAND THE FOLLOWING ARRANGE MENT OF THE BEDS IS GIVEN BY MR HULL FT IN 1 YELLOWISH SANDSTONE 4 0 2 SHALY CLAY WITH A BAND OF COPPERSAND AT THE BOTTOM 2 6 3

RESEARCHES ON VANADIUM 5 MORE THAN FROM 0 5 TO 2 5 PER CENT  IT IS DISSOLVED OUT BY HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND THE METAL PRECIPITATED FROM THE SOLUTION BY SCRAP IRON THE LEAD IS CONTAINED IN SMALL CRYSTALS THROUGHOUT THE MASS AND IS SEPARATED FROM THE SAND BY MACERATION AND WASHING SOME OF THE ROCK CONTAINS AS MUCH AS FROM 30 TO 40 PER CENT OF THE ORE THE SANDSTONE FROM WHICH THE VANADIUM PRECIPITATE WAS PREPARED POSSESSES A LIGHT COLOUR AND CONTAINS FROM 01 TO 0 3 PER CENT OF THE OXIDES OF COBALT NICKEL AND COPPER DISSEMINATED AS SMALL BLACK GREEN AND RED SPECKS THROUGHOUT THE MASS AFTER CRUSHING THE METALS WERE DISSOLVED OUT BY HYDROCHLORIC ACID BLEACHING LIQUOR AND MILK OF LIME WERE THEN ADDED TO ALKALINE REACTION A PORTION OF THE COPPER TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE OF THE NICKEL AND COBALT REMAINED IN SOLUTION WHILST THE LEAD IRON ARSENIC PARTLY DERIVED FROM THE ACID USED A LITTLE COPPER AND THE VANADIUM WERE PRECIPITATED AS THE MOTTRAM MINE IS NOW CLOSED I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO OBTAIN A SAMPLE OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED SAND STONE FOR EXAMINATION AND THEREFORE I CANNOT STATE POSITIVELY WHETHER THE VANADIUM OCCURS AS VANADINITE ALTHOUGH FOR OTHER REASONS I AM INCLINED TO THINK THAT IT DOES THE ABOVEMENTIONED LIME PRECIPITATE WAS BELIEVED BY THE MANAGER OF THE MINES TO CONTAIN ABOUT 10 PER CENT OF COPPER BUT WHEN IT WAS DISSOLVED IN ACID AND THE COPPER THROWN DOWN BY ZINC THE SOLUTION STILL RETAINED A BRIGHT BLUE COLOUR WHICH I SOON RECOG NIZED AS BEING DUE TO VANADIUM A ROUGH ANALYSIS OF THE CRUDE LIME PRECIPITATE SHOWS THAT IT CONTAINS ABOUT 2 PER CENT OF VANADIUM TOGETHER WITH LEAD ARSENIC IRON LIME AND SULPHURIC AND PHOSPHORIC ACIDS IN ORDER TO PREPARE PURE VANADIUM COMPOUNDS IN QUANTITY FROM THIS MATERIAL I WAS GLAD TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE KINDNESS OF MY FRIENDS MESSRS ROBERTS DALE AND CO WHO WERE GOOD ENOUGH TO PLACE THEIR WORKS AT MY DISPOSAL FOR THIS PURPOSE THREE CWT OF THE CRUDE MATERIAL WAS DRIED AND THEN FINELY GROUND WITH FOUR TIMES ITS WEIGHT OF COAL AND THE MIXTURE WELL FURNACED WITH CLOSED DOORS FOR SEVERAL DAYS UNTIL THE GREATEST PART OF THE ARSENIC HAD BEEN DRIVEN OFF THE COAL HAVING BEEN THUS BURNT OFF THE MASS WAS THEN GROUND UP WITH ONE QUARTER OF ITS WEIGHT OF SODAASH AND WELL ROASTED IN A REVER BERATORY FURNACE WITH OPEN DOORS FOR TWO DAYS TO OXIDIZE THE VANADIUM TO A SOLUBLE VANADATE THE MASS WAS NEXT LIXIVIATED AND THE SOLUTION DRAWN OFF FROM INSOLUBLE MAT TERS THE LIQUID WAS ACIDIFIED WITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID AND SULPHUROUS ACID WAS THEN PASSED INTO THE SOLUTION TO REDUCE THE ARSENATES WHEN THE REMAINING ARSENIC WAS PRECI PITATED BY SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN THE DEEPBLUE SOLUTION THUS OBTAINED WAS CAREFULLY NEUTRALIZED BY AMMONIA AN EXCESS CAUSES MUCH OF THE VANADIUM TO PASS INTO SOLUTION THE PRECIPITATED VANADIUM OXIDE WASHED ON CLOTH FILTERS OXIDIZED BY NITRIC ACID AND EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS THE WELLDRIED CRUDE VANADIC ACID WAS THEN BOILED OUT WITH A SATURATED SOLUTION OF AMMONIUM CARBONATE WHICH LEFT IRON OXIDE AND CALCIUM SULPHATE ALUMINA C INSOLUBLE AND THE FILTRATE EVA PORATED UNTIL THE INSOLUBLE AMMONIUM VANADATE SEPARATED OUT THIS CRUDE VANADATE WAS THEN WASHED WITH SALAMMONIAC SOLUTION TO FREE IT FROM SODASALT AND RECRYSTALLIZED IN ORDER TO PREPARE FROM THIS SALT PURE VANADIC ACID IT WAS ROASTED IN THE AIR AND THE POWDERY ACID OBTAINED WAS SUSPENDED IN WATER INTO WHICH AMMONIA GAS WAS PASSED THE DISSOLVED6 PROFESSOR ROSCOES RESEARCHES ON VANADIUM AMMONIUM VANADATE WAS SEPARATED BY FILTRATION FROM A RESIDUE CONTAINING SILICA PHOS PHATES C AND WAS CRYSTALLIZED BY EVAPORATION IN PLATINUM THE PENTOXIDE OBTAINED FROM THIS SALT WAS FREE FROM PHOSPHORUS ANOTHER MODE WHICH WAS ADOPTED IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PERFECTLY PURE VANADIUM PENTOXIDE WAS TO PREPARE THE PURE OXYCHLORIDE AND THIS ON BEING DECOMPOSED BY WATER YIELDED THE ACID AS A FINE ORANGECOLOURED POWDER IN ORDER TO FREE THIS POWDER FROM ANY TRACE OF OBSTINATELY ADHERING SILICA IT WAS MOIS TENED WITH SULPHURIC ACID AND EXPOSED IN A PLATINUM VESSEL FOR SOME DAYS TO HYDROFLUORIC ACID GAS AFTER EXPELLING THE SULPHURIC ACID AND ON FUSION A MASS OF LARGE TRANSPARENT CRYSTALS OF CHEMICALLY PURE VANADIC ACID WAS OBTAINED THE VANADIUM MINERALS APPEAR INVARIABLY TO CONTAIN MORE OR LESS PHOSPHORUS AND THIS FACT IN ITSELF SERVES TO ESTABLISH THE CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN THESE TWO ELEMENTS THE COMPLETE SEPARATION OF THIS SUBSTANCE FROM VANADIUM IS ATTENDED WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY IF MUCH PHOSPHORUS IS CONTAINED WITH THE VANADIUM THE METHOD WHICH HAS PROVED MOST EFFECTUAL FOR ITS REMOVAL IS TO DEFLAGRATE THE FINELY DIVIDED IMPURE ACID WITH ITS OWN WEIGHT OF SODIUM IN A WELLCOVERED WROUGHTIRON CRUCIBLE AND WASH THE RESULTING MIXTURE OF VANADIUM OXIDES BY DECANTATION UNTIL THE WASHWATER CEASES TO GIVE AN ALKALINE REACTION FREQUENTLY THIS OPERATION HAD TO BE REPEATED THREE TIMES BE FORE THE MOLYBDENUM TEST CEASED TO INDICATE PHOSPHORUS IN OTHER PREPARATIONS IN WHICH THE PHOSPHORUS HAD BEEN MORE COMPLETELY REMOVED BY PREVIOUS OPERATIONS THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE OF REPEATED CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE AMMONIUM SALT WAS FOUND CAPABLE OF FURNISHING A PRODUCT IN WHICH NO TRACE OF YELLOW PRECIPITATE WAS PRODUCED BY MOLYBDENUM THE ACTION OF EVEN TRACES OF PHOSPHORIC ACID ON VANADIC ACID IS MOST REMARKABLE IF PRESENT IN QUANTITIES EXCEEDING 1 PER CENT OF THE WEIGHT OF THE VANADIUM PHOSPHORIC ACID ALTOGETHER PREVENTS THE CRYSTALLIZATION OF THE VANADIC ACID AND THE FUSED MASS POS SESSES A GLASSY FRACTURE AND A BLACK VITREOUS LUSTRE THIS EFFECT IS NOT PRODUCED BY THE PRESENCE OF EITHER SILICA ARSENIC OR THE LOWER OXIDES OF VANADIUM STILL MORE SINGULAR IS THE PROTECTIVE INFLUENCE WHICH EVEN TRACES OF PHOSPHORIC ACID EXERT UPON THE REDUCING ACTION OF HYDROGEN ON VANADIC ACID AT A RED HEAT THUS A MIXTURE OF PURE VANADIC ACID WITH 1 PER CENT OF PHOSPHORUS PENTOXIDE WEIGHING 15888 GRM ON IGNITION IN A CURRENT OF HYDROGEN LOST ONLY 0 0007 GRM IF NO PHOSPHORUS HAD BEEN PRESENT IT MUST HAVE LOST 02784 GEM III ATOMIC WEIGHT DETERMINATION OF VANADIUM BY REDUCTION OF VANADIUM PENTOXIDE IN HYDROGEN THE METHOD ORIGINALLY ADOPTED BY BERZELIUS FOR THE DETERMINATION OF THE ATOMIC WEIGHT OF VANADIUM VIZ THE REDUCTION OF VANADIC ACID IN A CURRENT OF HYDROGEN IS PER FECTLY RELIABLE INASMUCH AS THE REDUCED TRIOXIDE THE SUBOXIDE OF BERZELIUS DOES NOT UNDERGO ANY FURTHER CHANGE WHEN THE TEMPERATURE IS RAISED TO A BRIGHTRED HEAT AND THE REDUCTION OF THE PENTOXIDE TO TRIOXIDE AT TEMPERATURES MUCH BELOW THIS IS PERFECTLY DEFI NITE THLE NUMBER OBTAINED BY BERZELIUS ACCORDING TO THIS METHOD WAS V 685 THEPROFESSOR ROSCOES RESEARCHES ON VANADIUM 7 EXACT NUMBER WHICH THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS YIELD WHEN CALCULATED ON BERZELIUSS HYPOTHESIS IS 673 IN THE FOLLOWING DETERMINATIONS OF ATOMIC WEIGHTS THE QUANTITY OF POWDERED PENTOXIDE EMPLOYED WAS ALWAYS MORE THAN 5 GRINS  IT WAS PLACED EITHER IN A BENT TUBE OF HARD GLASS WHICH WHEN HEATED IN A MAGNESIA BATH WAS FOUND NOT TO LOSE MORE THAN 00001 GRM AFTER REPEATED IGNITION AND COOLING OR IN A PLATINUM BOAT PLACED IN A GLASS TUBE BEFORE REDUCTION THE POWDERED VANADIUM PENTOXIDE WAS GENTLY HEATED IN A CURRENT OF DRY AIR UNTIL THE WEIGHINGS AFTER TWO SUCCESSIVE OPERATIONS WERE FOUND TO BE CONSTANT AFTER THE REDUCTION THE TUBE WAS ALLOWED TO COOL COMPLETELY IN A CURRENT OF HYDROGEN AND THIS GAS WAS THEN DISPLACED BY A STREAM OF DRY AIR IF THE REDUCED OXIDE BE EVEN SLIGHTLY WARM WHEN IT IS EXPOSED TO THE AIR IT ABSORBS OXYGEN SUDDENLY GLOWS AND IS SUPERFICIALLY CONVERTED INTO A BLUE OXIDE IF HOWEVER THE OXIDE BE COLD IT MAY BE EX POSED TO DRY AIR FOR SOME TIME WITHOUT CHANGE OF WEIGHT AN EXPERIMENT IN WHICH NITRO GEN WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR AIR GIVING RESULTS IDENTICAL WITH THOSE IN WHICH AIR WAS USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE OXIDE WAS CONTAINED IN THE GLASS TUBE THE LATTER WAS CAREFULLY STOPPERED AND ALLOWED TO REMAIN FOR HALF AN HOUR IN THE BALANCECASE BEFORE WEIGHING WHEN THE PLATINUM BOAT WAS USED IT WAS CAREFULLY WITHDRAWN WITH THE RE DUCED OXIDE FROM THE COMBUSTIONTUBE AND PLACED IN A STOPPERED TESTTUBE FOR WEIGHING THESE PRECAUTIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY IN ORDER TO ENSURE ACCURACY OWING TO THE HYGROSCOPIC NATURE OF THE TRIOXIDE THE HYDROGEN EMPLOYED WAS MOST CAREFULLY PURIFIED AND DRIED ALLJOINTS AND STOPPERS IN THE APPARATUS WERE WELL SECURED BY COPPER WIRE AND PARAFFIN THE GAS PASSED THROUGH SOLUTIONS OF SILVER NITRATE SODIUM PYROGALLATE CAUSTIC SODA AND SULPHURIC ACID AND A TUBE FILLED WITH METALLIC COPPER KEPT REDHOT DURING THE EXPERIMENT WAS PLACED BEFORE THE FINAL DRYINGTUBE TO ENSURE ABSENCE OF OXYGEN IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER ATMOSPHERIC OXYGEN DIFFUSED INTO THE APPARATUS A WEIGHED TUBE CONTAINING PHOSPHORUS PENTOXIDE WAS ATTACHED TO THE FURTHER END OF THE COMBUSTIONTUBE DURING AN EXPERI MENT AND ALLOWED TO REMAIN FOR FOUR HOURS WHILST HYDROGEN WAS PASSING THROUGH THE HEATED TUBE AT THE END OF THE OPERATION THE DRYINGTUBE HAD GAINED ONLY 00002 GRM PROVING THE ABSENCE OF DIFFUSED OXYGEN FOR THE PURPOSE OF DRYING THE HYDROGEN BOILED SULPHURIC ACID ALONE CAN BE USED IN MANY OF THE PRELIMINARY EXPERIMENTS PHOSPHORUS PENTOXIDE WAS USED IN THE LAST DRYINGTUBE AND IN ALL THESE CASES THE REDUCING ACTION OF THE HYDROGEN WAS NOT COMPLETE THE NUMBERS THUS OBTAINED FOR THE ATOMIC WEIGHT BEING ALL TOO HIGH AFTER MUCH LABOUR THIS WAS FOUND TO BE ENTIRELY CAUSED BY SMALL TRACES OF THE LIGHT PARTICLES OF THE PHOSPHORUS PENTOXIDE WHICH WERE INVARIABLY CARRIED OVER IN SPITE OF STOPPERS OF COTTONWOOL WITH THE AIR AND HYDROGEN INTO THE VANADIC ACID  IN ORDER TO ENSURE ACCURACY IT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO EMPLOY A LARGER QUANTITY OF MATERIAL THAN WAS TAKEN BY BERZELIUS THE LARGEST AMOUNT WHICH HE USED WAS 22585 GRMS VANADIC ACID AND THE SMALLEST 06499 GRM AN ERROR OF ONE MILLIGRAMME ON THE FIRST WEIGHT WILL PRODUCE A VARIATION OF  02 IN THE ATOMIC WEIGHT WHILST A SIMILAR ERROR ON THE SMALLER QUANTITY WOULD THROW OUT THE RESULT BY  07 IF 5 GRMS OF SUB  STANCE

YIELDED 35649 GRMS TRIOXIDE OR V554 ON TESTING THE RESIDUAL OXIDE FOR PHOSPHORUS THE TOP LAYER OF TRIOXIDE IN THE BOAT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN PHOSPHORUS PENTOXIDE WHEREAS THE LOWER LAYERS WERE FREE FROM IT IN ORDER TO SHOW THAT THE REDUCTION IN THESE CASES WAS INCOMPLETE 34886 GRMS OF THE REDUCED OXIDE FROM AN EXPERIMENT OF THE KIND WAS TREATED IN A TUBE WITH DRY CHLORINE WHEN ALL THE CHLORIDE HAD VOLATILIZED THE RESIDUAL VANADIC ACID WAS FUSED AND FOUND TO WEIGH 2165 GRMS IF THE OXIDE HAD BEEN COMPLETELY REDUCED THE RESIDUAL VANADIC ACID WOULD HAVE WEIGHED 1407 GRM NO LESS THAN NINE DETERMINATIONS OF ATOMIC WEIGHT WERE MADE WITH EVERY POSSIBLE PRE CAUTION IN WHICH THE RESULTS VARIED FROM 522 TO 654 OWING SOLELY TO THE EMPLOYMENT OF DRYINGTUBES CONTAINING PHOSPHORIC ANHYDRIDE AS

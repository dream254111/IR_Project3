LEGISLATION AS AF FECTING OWNERS OF RAILROAD SECURITIES S DAVIES WARFIELD President National Association of Owners of Railroad Securities President The Continental Trust Company Baltimore ON November 12th a statement appeared in the press signed by the chief executives of organizations of railroad workers including three of the four principal brother hoods This statement in denouncing the labor clauses of the Esch Bill characterized it as a conscienceless betrayal of the public interest that it validates twenty billion dollars of rail road securities at least eight billions of which is water that it caters to Big Business and that generally the measure is vicious The statement continued This travesty on legislation re veals the fundamental weakness of all schemes to return the roads to their former owners The fact is that private owner ship of the means of transportation has broken down   That apparently our statesmanship is as bankrupt as our rail roads    That the railroads should be held under fed eral control for at least two years and in respect to government ownership it said that labor is willing to accept the sober judg ment of the American voters as expressed at a general election Esch Bill Stripped of Revenue Provision Since this statement was made the Esch Bill has passed the House stripped of the provision which the Committee of the House that framed the bill thought would enable rates to be made which would ensure sufficient revenue properly to operate the railroads The defeated section read thus In reaching its conclusions as to the justness and reasonable ness of any rate fare charge classification regulation or prac tice the Commission shall take into consideration the interest of the public and the shippers the reasonable cost of maintenance and operation including the wages of labor depreciation and taxes and a fair return upon the value of the property used or held for the service of transportation Under the bill as amended and passed the inefficient rate laws 632PENDING CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION stand as at present constituted with the wage dispute adjustment provision incorporated therein demanded by the chief executives of the brotherhoods The failure of a ratemaking formula to pass the House sub stantiates our contention that the Act should definitely interpret what a reasonable rate means by naming the minimum and provide for a maximum return from such rates as the only prac tical legislative solution of the railroad problem Definite di rections in the act in respect to these essentials are as necessary to satisfy the demands of the public the apprehensions of the shippers and the caution of Congress as it is to be certain that the railroads will be enabled to give adequate service as a whole and finance themselves To state that rates shall be made that will produce reasonable return adds nothing to the bill or to the present law that has not been considered by the Commission in the past in making rates as pointed out by Commissioner Clark at a hearing before the House Committee The specific charge in respect to railroad securities made in the statement by the organization of railroad workers referred to requires answer The charge is that the Esch Bill before amendment clearly meaning any legislation giving financial protection validates approximately twenty billion dollars of railroad securities at least eight billions of which is water and directs the Interstate Commerce Commission to tax the Ameri can people through an increase in freight and passenger rates to pay dividends on those shadow dollars Any such characterization of railway value is untrue and is but one of many evidences of a deliberate determination by violent terms and action to attempt to coerce and demoralize Congress so that no constructive railroad legislation shall pass By these irresponsible representations as to values and denounce ment of the Congress where they say statesmanship is as bank rupt as our railroads and by abusive criticism of proposed leg islation inconsistent with their own those issuing the statement have apparently succeeded in defeating the meagre financial pro visions in the Esch Bill and hope to destroy the enterprise which employ the men they purport to represent in order that they may gain its possession The reckless charges in respect to the value of the securities of the railroads are but a repetition of similar misstatements in connection with railroad legislation which for months has been 633 No 4 121RAILROAD LEGISLATION before committees of both the Senate and the House of Represen sentatives Property Accounts Represent Less Than Aggregate Value The property investment accounts of the railroads have been under the close supervision of the Interstate Commerce Commis sion only since 1907 yet within the short intervening period of twelve years the records show that more than six billion dollars of cash expenditure has been made on the properties of Class I railroads over onethird of the seventeen and a half billion dol lars total property book value of these roads exclusive of inter company securities as of the test period 19151617 I am speaking of property value not security values or issues No wellinformed person will contest the statement that in the ag gregate the properties and equipment devoted to the public use of Class I railroads 89 per cent of the total mileage are worth more in the aggregate than the seventeen and a half billion dol lars as shown by the books of the railroads But whether this be true or not true the billions of alleged water and shadow dollars are effectually provided against in Section 6 of the Cummins Bill now awaiting action by the Senate The importance of the provisions of this section of the Cum mins Bill as the minimum essential to the continuance of the de velopment and prosperity of the country cannot be too strongly urged upon Congress upon the shipping interests and the public It now stands alone between a successful transportation system privately owned and operated and a government system how operated you cannot know Fair Value of Railroads Taken as Basis for Return The effect of Section 6 of the Cummins Bill is to provide that pending actual physical valuations of all railroad properties the Interstate Commerce Commission taking into consideration all the elements that should properly be considered shall deter mine the fair value of the property and equipment of the rail roads in the aggregate in each rate group For the purpose of determining and adjusting rates so that they will yield a living and fair return the Commission shall group the roads as they have done in the past for a similar purpose into as many groups as they may decide Upon the aggregate amount of the invest ment in or fair value of all the railroads of each group a 634 122 VOL vInPENDING CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION level of rates shall be established that will yield as nearly as may be 512 per cent on this aggregate value plus onehalf of 1 per cent at the discretion of the Commission for unproductive improvements which in the case of those roads earning over 6 per cent on value determined as statednot on securitiesshall not be capitalized for future rate making Earnings that may be made by any railroad in excess of the 6 per cent on value and up to 7 per cent are divided onehalf to the railroad earning them as incentive the other half to be used as a national fund administered by a government au thority in the interest of transportation as a whole for joint ter minals and other joint facilities or for cars and equipment to be leased to roads to relieve congestion but not to be capitalized in future rate making Thus there is a division of excess earnings beyond the given reasonable return on fair value between those who use the railroads and those who own them The onehalf of the excess which goes to the road earning it is credited to a reserve account to be used under specific conditions to en able it to meet financial obligations and in lean years to provide against deficiencies which might impair its obligations to the public After 7 per cent is earned by any road the ratio of divis ion becomes onethird to the railroad earning it and twothirds to the transportation fund Section 6 Cummins Bill Provides Against Socalled Watered Securities Under Section 6 of the Cummins Bill the aggregate value of the roads of the respective groups is taken Rates are based on such value without respect to the amount of securities which may have been issued by any railroad Since the public and shipper would pay only a reasonable return on the value of each group of railroads as determined by public authority and get back part of what they pay to maintain transportation as a whole in the use of the facilities purchased from the general transporta tion fund created from excess earnings the misrepresentations that have been made and the clamor of the past that the public pays returns on false investment would end If this section of the Cummins Bill becomes the law the idle talk about paying or earning dividends or a return on watered securities and shadow dollars will cease and private ownership and operation will be permanently established 635 No 4 123RAILROAD LEGISLATION Many railroads will not earn as much as the 52 or 6 per cent on their individual property and equipment which would go to make up part of the aggregate of the railroad property in their respective groups Rates being made on the aggregate value of all the property of a group each railroad earns on its own value as much as it can secure through efficiency in operation and man agement So a railroad that is overcapitalized in securities suf fers in the percentage return it would receive on such securities because the return is based on the fair value of its property and equipment No greater incentive could be given to each railroad than to require that its earnings from rates made on the aggregate value of all shall depend entirely upon its own ef ficiency and not upon a guaranteed amount to each or a govern ment guarantee security Those roads that earn over 6 per cent on the value of their property have the incentive to make the earnings in excess thereof as great as possible because they re tain onehalf of such excess between 6 and 7 per cent and one third after 7 per cent So there is no guarantee of any descrip tion directly or indirectly given Rates are made that would yield the stated return on the value of the transportation system as a whole and no two roads will necessarily receive the same percentage return because each earns on its own value what it can from rates made for all the leveling is accomplished through the regulation of earnings in excess of the percentage return DirectorGeneral Hines Prediction The Esch Bill now passed by the House does not contain nor did the unamended bill contain any permanent financial provision for the railroads It does not nor did the original bill provide for the regulation of excess earnings essential to produce a uni formly efficient service throughout our transportation system Such regulation becomes necessary because railroads that serve dense traffic territory can earn more from a rate than those serv ing sparsely settled territory and the latter constitute the ma jority of the railroads Class I You cannot make rates that will suit all the railroads alike A rate level that will enable the great majority of railroads to live must necessarily produce more earnings to roads serving dense traffic territory than such roads are entitled to have and more than they would receive but for the necessities of the majority The Commission in the past has hesitated to allow rates that will give to a few favorably situated 636 VOL VIII 124PENDING CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION roads inordinate earnings which the shippers and public served by these roads have repeatedly declared they will not stand for Yet such a result is unavoidable under present laws if regard is to be had for the life of the majority which constitute those roads not so favorably situated as the few The result has been that the Commission could not make rates that were necessary to the majority so the railroads and the public have both suffered the consequences Should this continue If it does Director General Hines prediction will come true when he said that The plan of private management necessarily involves the idea that if one or many railroad companies happen to be exceptionally prosperous the entire exceptional profits remain with the railroad company This condition continues Mr Hines will make the public always fear or suspect that it is being exploited through the transportation service for the benefit of private capital and will lead to continual insistence upon the railroads being operated exclusively for the public benefit through government ownership and operation Mr Hines recognized the necessity of excess earnings regu lation Crurx of Railroad Problem Solved by Section 6 Cummins Bill At a hearing before the House Committee which framed the Esch Bill in reply to a member of the Committee who after re peating substantially the provision relating to rates then in the proposed bill whether such provision would change the past methods of the Commission for making rates Commissioner Clark a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission and Chairman of their Legislative Committee stated that it would not change it in substance because all of those things are now considered In like manner Commissioner Clark when ques tioned upon the advisability of providing in the act a fixed per centage return on value ascertained by public authority which as we have shown carries with it regulation of excess earnings stated it would avoid endless controversies and it would put an end to interminable discussion and argument There is no higher type of man than the men who occupy re sponsible positions in the service of the railroads From the locomotive engineer to the man who walks the track I do not be lieve one of them if fully informed would look for fairer protec tion to themselves and the public than is provided by Section 6 of the Cummins Bill Shippers and the public are vitally con cerned in this section for unless adequate revenue is provided 6371 No 4 125RAILROAD LEGISLATION for the railroads now only to be had through definite require ments of a fixed return with a division and regulation of earn ings in excess thereof substantially as Section 6 provides their railroad service will break down for another opportunity will not be afforded them for securing constructive legislation and Government ownership will be forced upon them Whether all the existing railroads shall be ultimately forced to consolidate into twentyfive or thirtyfive or two or three larger companies or whether consolidations are made permissive which we favor it will require years of valuation bargaining and litigation in the case of the former and considerable time in the case of the latter so this is not the immediate issue The crux of this problem lies in whether the principles laid down in Section 6 of the Cummins Bill are to be enacted into law as the only means to save the railroads on the termination of the pro posed six months extension of the standard return or whether they shall be turned back to their owners loaded with debt many of them their traffic disrupted as the consequence of the neces sary unification plans of the government incident to the war with nothing to rely upon but the same regulating laws and pro cedure of the past nothing definite upon which they can depend Any legislation embodying substantially what is now on the statute books though it may contain added verbiage will fail unless it empowers the Commission to adjust rates through the regulation of excess earnings of a comparatively few rail roads and to a fair and reasonably fixed initial return to all Section 6 of the Cummins Bill is a constructive step in recog nizing that the impossible conditions which existed in the past between the shipper and the carrier must be stopped that the business of transportation may be carried on in a business fash ion The mandate by Congress to the Commission comes as near producing an automatic adjustment of rates as possible and will avoid the endless controversies and interminable dis cussion as characterized by Commissioner Clark Securities Association Largest Organized Group of Owners in Existence The National Association of Owners of Railroad Securities represents the largest single organized group of railroad securi ties in existence They come nearer as an active force being the owners of the railroads than any other single organization It 638 126 VOL VIIIPENDING CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION is not unreasonable for some of them at least to think that they should be listened to in respect to legislation by the operating heads of railroads that have sold them the securities they own particularly when such legislation is financial They find them selves opposed by a few executives who in the name of their Executives Association beginning with opposition to our efforts in securing adequate protective clauses in the standard form of government contract when the roads were taken over are now in open hostility to the one thing the Securities Association chiefly stands for namely the principles involved in Section 6 of the Cummins Bill The owners of the great majority of the out standing securities of all the railroads find themselves in the un fortunate position of being called upon through this Association to defend their securities from attacks when they had at least the right to expect that the presidents of the railroads that issued such securities should cooperate to secure the legislation the owners believe to be necessary But these few executives in the name of and exerting the influence of their Association of Rail way Executives though many executives of the member roads are not in sympathy with such action are attempting to defeat the purposes of Section 6 of the Cummins Bill the only con structive railroad legislation offered in years and thereby find themselves unable to offer assistance Their campaign in some instances is as misleading as that of the framers of the state ment attacking the Esch Bill and they are lending them assistance in establishing conditions which will not only work injury to those they are supposed to represent but will eventually lead to government ownership Their attitude is illustrated in a letter among others received from one of the prominent railroad presidents of the country He asserts that the Executives As sociation is dominated by certain interests who are largely re sponsible for the past and present difficulities of the railroads In the present instance the Bourbons are running to form The Association believed the time had come when all that could be expected is a fair initial return with sufficient in ad dition above that return to preserve the incentive essential to efficient service Inherent traffic and territorial difficulties de manded that the regulation of these properties must extend to the earnings in excess of this fair return In the light of the ex perience of the past we wish to see an end put to the intermin able discussions as to rates that have occurred in the past before 639 No 4 127RAILROAD LEGISLATION the Commission and the owners of the railroads should be will ing to make sacrifices to secure it Dangers in the Situation Millions of citizens depositors in mutual savings banks and owners of policies in the great mutual life insurance companies are represented through their companies as members as are also those represented by investing institutions generally all owning vast amounts of railroad securities and are vitally con cerned in the pending legislation The propaganda being spread throughout the country aimed at the defeat of all railroad legislation unless a partnership is created by Act between the brotherhoods and the government under government ownership means that all the political force they can muster will be used against members of Congress who decline to accede to their demands Representatives in legislative bodies should be brought to feel that they are not to be left to be beaten because without fear or favor they fulfill their obligations of office Unless these con ditions are recognized our institutions will be seriously impaired There is every indication that the public expects to see the rail road problem solved and settled permanently Anything less than the requirements of Section 6 of the Cummins Bill will not meet their expectations The rank and file of the employees of the railroads when made conversant with actual conditions cannot sanction the methods being used to defeat constructive legislation which will solve the railroad problem with due regard for all interests and classes The rank and file should know that in the division of excess earn ings our original proposal was that any excess over the fixed initial return should be divided onethird to the railroad earning such excess onethird to a fund in the interest of railroad em ployees and onethird to the national fund created to be spent in the interest of transportation The Brotherhood chiefs op posed this they did not favor the employees having a participa tion in earnings under private ownership So this was abandoned The time has arrived when the trustees of those representing the great mutual investing institutions should have their depen dents know the extent to which this propaganda and these pur poses have reached and what it means to the thirtythree million holders of life insurance policies to the millions of depositors in 640 VOL VIII 128PENDING CONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION savings banks to individual investors and others We live under a partisan political government and unless those who represent these millions of owners meet the situation by giving support to those public servants who strive to do their duty a small minority of the electorate through the propaganda now being spread throughout the country will bring about the destruction not alone of the rights of property but the very foundation of our Govern ment 641 No 41 129

Sunshiny day takes a Plate or Trencher with a little Sugar Ho ney or Molosses spread on it and when got into the Woods sets it down on a Rock or Stump in the Woods this the Bees soon scent and find out for tis generally supposed a Bee will scent Ho ney or Wax above a Miles distance The Hunter secures in a Box or other Conveniency one or more of the Bees as they fill themselves and after a little time lets one of them go observing very carefully the Course the Bee steers for after he rises in the Air he flies directly or upon a streight Course to the Tree where the Hive is In order to this the Hunter carries with him his Pocket Compass his Rule and other Implements with a Sheet of Paper and sets down the Course suppose it be West by this he is sure the Tree must be somewhere in a West Line from where he is but wants to know the exact Distance from his Sta tion149 tion in order to determine that he makes an off set either South or North well suppose North an hundred Perch or Rod if it be more it will still be more exact because the Angle will not be so acute then he takes out another Bee and lets him go observing his Course also very carefully for he being loaded will as the first after he is mounted a convenient height fly directly to the Hive this second Course as I must call it the Hunter finds to be South 54 Degrees West then there remains nothing but to find out where the two Courses in tersect or which is the same thing the Distance from B to A or from C to A as in the Figure Tab 3d for there the HoneyTree is For which Reason if the Course of the second Bee from C had been Southwest and by South viz to D then the HiveTree must have been there for there the Lines are found to intersect The Foundation of all this is the streight or di rect motion of Bees when bound home with their Honey and this is found to be certain by the Ob servation and Experience of our Hunters every Year and especially of late Years since this Mathe matical way of finding Honey in the Woods has been used with such Success An ingenious Man of my Acquaintance the last Year took two or three of his Neighbours that knew nothing of the matter and after he had taken his Bees set the Courses the first and second Bee steered made the offset and taken the Distance from the two Stations to the Interfectionhe gave orders to cut down such a Tree pointing to it the Labourers smiled and were confident there was no Honey there for they could not perceive the Tree to be hollow or to have150 have any hole for the Bees to enter by and would have disswaded the Gentleman from felling the Tree but he insisted on it and offered to lay them any Wager that the Hive was there and so it proved to the great surprize of the Countrymen I cannot dismiss this Subject without acquainting you that all the Bees we have in our Gardens or in our Woods and which now are in great numbers are the produce of such as were brought in Hives from England near a hundred Years ago and not the natural produce of this part of America for the first Planters of New England never observed a Bee in the Woods until many Years after the Country was settled but that which proves it beyond question is that the Aborigines the Indians have no word in their Language for a Bee as they have for all Ani mals whatsoever proper to or aboriginally of the Country and therefore for many Years called a Bee by the name of English Mans Fly Our People formerly used to find out Honey in the Woods by surprizing and following one Bee after another by the Eye till at length they found out where the Bees hived I will mention another thing with respect to Bees tho I dont know but it may have been commonly observed and that is when they Swarm they never go to the Northward but move Southward or in clining that way I should have taken notice in the proper place that when one Bee goes home from the Sugarplate he returns with a considerable number from the Hive VIII

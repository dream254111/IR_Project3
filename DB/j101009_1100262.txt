COURTS OF PLACING WIT NESSES UNDER THE RULE IS OF VERY ANCIENT ORIGIN THOUGH STILL A MATTER OF DAILY OCCURRENCE THE WISDOM OF THE PRACTICE WAS PERHAPS NEVER MORE DRAMATICALLY DEM ONSTRATED THAN IN THE FIRST INSTANCE OF ITS USAGE THE HISTORICAL ACCOUNT OF WHICH IS A BIT OF LEGAL LORE THAT SHOULD BE FOUND IN THE MENTAL GREEN BAG OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE PROFESSIONPRINCIPALLY BECAUSE IT SMACKS FAINTLY OF THE WATERS OF THE PIERIAN SPRING AND HAS A TENDENCY WHEN TOLD IN AN IMPRESSIVE MANNER TO CONVINCE THE LISTENER THAT THE TELLER HAS PAR TAKEN RATHER LIBERALLY OF ITS BLESSINGS INCIDENTALLY IT MAY BE NOTED THAT THE CASE FROM WHICH THE PRACTICE AROSE WAS THE FIRST INSTANCE OF THE DIRECT EXAMINATION OF THE WITNESS TO THE ORIGINALITY AND WISDOM OF DANIEL WHO WAS THEN A YOUNG YOUTH OR YOUNGSTER THE PROFESSION IS INDEBTED FOR THE PRACTICE THE CIRCUM STANCES LEADING TO THE APPLICATION BRIEFLY TOLD RUN IN THIS WISE IN THE CITY OF BABYLON LIVED JOACIM A VERY WEALTHY MAN WHO ON AC COUNT OF HIS INTEGRITY AND UPRIGHTNESS WAS HELD IN HIGH ESTEEM BY ALL HIS FELLOWMEN HIS HOME WAS A CASTLE OF DELIGHT AND ITS FURNISHINGS WERE SUMPTUOUS AND LUXURIOUS ADJOINING HIS HOUSE WAS A VERY BEAUTIFUL GARDEN MOST PLEASING TO THE EYE TO JOACIMS HOUSE THE SAGES AND TEACHERS RESORTED AS A PLACE OF GATH ERING AND CONSULTATION FOR HIS LIBERALITY AND HOSPITALITY WERE NOTORIOUS JOACIM MARRIED SUSANNA A VERY FAIR WOMAN AND BEAUTIFUL TO LOOK UPON IT WAS HER CUSTOM ATTENDED BY HER MAIDS TO WALK IN THE GARDEN TWO ELDERS OR JUDGES WERE AT THIS TIME APPOINTED TO GOVERN THE PEOPLE AND TO DETERMINE THEIR DISPUTES AND ON ACCOUNT OF JOACIMS PROMINENCE AND LIBERALITY THEY ESTABLISHED THEIR COURTS IN HIS HOUSE AND ALL WHO HAD SUITS IN LAW CAME TO THEM THERE AT NOON WHEN THE SUITORS HAD DEPARTED SU SANIIA WOULD WALK IN HER GARDEN AND THE JUDGES SEEING HER UPON HER WALKS WERE 4WOUNDED FOR LOVE OF HER THOUGH NEITHER WOULD DECLARE TO THE OTHER HIS LUST AND SO IT HAPPENED WHEN THE SUITORS HAD DEPARTED AND THE JUDGES HAD GONE EACH TO HIS SEPARATE PLACE OF ABODE THAT BOTH OF THEM SECRETLY RE TURNED AND BY ACCIDENT ENCOUNTERED ONE ANOTHER WHEREUPON EACH CON FESSED TO THE OTHER HIS LUST TOGETHER THEY THEN PLOTTED TO BRING SUSANNA TO THEIR DESIRES SO THEY HID THEMSELVES IN HER GARDEN AND WHEN SUSANNACAME TO THE GARDEN TO BATHE HERSELF ATTENDED BY HER MAIDS AND WHEN SHE HAD DISPATCH ED HER MAIDS TO FETCH HER OINTMENTS AND TO BAR THE DOORS OF THE GARDEN THE TWO JUDGES CAME TO HER AND SAID BEHOLD THE GARDEN DOORS ARE SHUT THAT NO MAN CAN SEE US AND WE ARE IN LOVE WITH THEE THEREFORE CONSENT UNTO US AND LIE WITH 11S SAYING THAT IF SHE REFUSED THEM THEIR DESIRES THEY464 10 VIRGIINLA LAW REGISTER SEPT WOULD BEAR WITNESS THAT THEY HAD FOUND A YOUNG MAN WITH HER BUT SU SANNA BEING A WOMAN OF PIETY AND CHASTITY DISREGARDED THEIR THREATS AND CALLED LOUDLY FOR HER ATTENDANTS THE JUDGES THREW OPEN THE DOORS OF THE GARDEN AND WHEN THE SERVANTS ENTERED THEY RAISED THEIR ACCUSATIONS AGAINST HER UPON THE DAY FOLLOWING WHEN THE PEOPLE HAD GATHERED THE JUDGES OR DERED THAT SUSANNA SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE THEM AND WHEN SHE WAS BEFORE THEM    THE TWO ELDERS STOOD UP IN THE MIDST OF THE PEOPLE AND LAID THEIR HANDS UPON HER HEAD AND SAID AS WE WALKED IN THE GARDEN ALONE THIS WOMAN CAME WITH HER TWO MAIDS AND SHUT THE GARDEN DOORS AND SENT THE MAIDS AWAY THEN A YOUNG MAN WHO WAS THERE HID CAME UNTO HER AND LAY WITH HER WE THAT STOOD IN THE CORNER OF THE GARDEN SEEING THIS WICKEDNESS RAN UNTO THEM AND THE MAN WE COULD NOT HOLD FOR HE WAS STRONGER THAN WE AND OPENED THE GARDEN DOOR AND LEAPED OUT BUT WE HAVE TAKEN THIS WOMAN AND WE ASKED HER WHO THE YOUNG MAN WAS BUT SHE WOULD NOT TELL US THESE THINGS DO WE TESTIFY THE PEOPLE WHO HEARD THIS BELIEVED FOR THE JUDGES THEMSELVES HAD TESTI FIED SUSANNA BEING FOUND GUILTY OF ADULTERY UNDER THE MOSAIC LAW WAS CON DEMNED TO DIE WHEN SHE WAS LED OUT TO THE PLACE OF EXECUTION A YOUNG MAN WHOSE NAME WAS DANIEL STOOD BY AND HE CALLED IN A LOUD VOICE THAT HE WAS GUILTLESS FROM THE BLOOD OF THIS WOMAN AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE ABOUT HIM ASKED HIM THE MEANING OF HIS WORDS AND THEN HE SPOKE TO THEM TELLING THEM THAT THEY WERE FOOLS FOR CONDEMNING A DAUGHTER OF ISRAEL WITHOUT EXAMINATION OR KNOWTLEDGE OF TRUTH BIDDING THEM TO RETURN AGAIN TO THE PLACE OF JUDGMENT THE PEOPLE RETURNED AND HE FURTHER BADE THEM TO PUT THE TWO JUDGES AESIDE ONE FAR FROM THE OTHER AND WHEN THEY WERE SEPARATED HE ORDERED THAT ONE BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND WHEN HE WAS BROUGHT DAN IEL ASKED NOW THENI IF THOU HAST SEEN HER TELL ME UNDER WHAT TREE SAWEST THOU THEM COMPANYING TOGETHER  AND THE JUDGE ANSWERED HIM AND SAID UNDER A MASTIC TREE AND DANIEL THEN ORDERED THAT THE OTHER JUDGE SHOULD BE BROUGHT BEFORE HIM AND QUESTIONED UNDER WHAT TREE DIDST THOU TAKE THEM COMPANYING TOGETHER AND THE JUDGE ANSWERED UNDER A HOLNI TREE THEN THE PEOPLE ROSE UP AGAINST THE JUDGES FOR DANIEL HAD CONVICTED THEM OF FALSE WITNESS BY THEIR OWN MOUTH AND FOLLOWING THE MOSAIC LAW THE PEOPLE DID UNTO THE JUDGES IN SUCH SORT AS THEY HAD MALICIOUSLY INTEND ED TO DO UNTO SUSANNA THE COMPLETE TEXT MAY BE FOUND IN THE APOCRYPHA OF THE BIBLE IN THE HISTERY OF SUSANNA A KYLED

BY AN INDIVIDUAL 1 MORAWETZ ON PR CORS SEC 338 WHEN SEA R MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENTA GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN IN VIRGINIA ON THE QUESTION WHETHER OR NOT A SEAL MUST BE RECOGNIZED AS SUCH IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT WHICH IS MOST COMMONLY DONE BY THE USE OF THE WORDS WITNESS MY HAND AND SEAL FROM THE LANGUAGE USED IN AT LEAST ONE NOTE 5 VA L R 333 IT SEEMS THAT THE WRITER IS OF OPINION THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT BUT THAT THE SEAL MUST NOW BE RECOGNIZED IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT IN ALL CASES WE SUBMIT THAT THIS IS NOT THE LAW AS TO WHETHER THE SEAL MUST BE RECOGNIZED IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT DEPENDS UPON WHETHER OR NOT THE WRITING TO WHICH THE SEAL IS AFFIXED WOULD BE A VALID AND BINDING CONTRACT IF NOT UNDER SEAL IF THE SEAL BE REQUISITE TO GIVE VALIDITY TO THE INSTRUMENT AS FOR EX AMPLE IN THE CASE OF A DEED THE CASES ARE UNANIMOUS IN HOLDING THAT THE SEAL ALONE WITHOUT ANY RECOGNITION IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT IS SUF FICIENT PARKS V

R 279 BRADLEY SALT CO V NORFOLK ETC CO 95 VA 461 3 VA L R 722 THE REASONS FOR REQUIRING A RECOGNITION OF THE SEAL IN THIS CLASS OF CASES ARE VERY FULLY GIVEN BY JUDGE BUCHANAN IN BRADLEY SALT CO V NORFOLK ETC CO 95 VA 461 3 VA L R 722 HLE SAYS THE FACILITY WITH WHICH A SEAL OF WAX OR A SCROLL MAY BE FRAUDULENTLY AFFIX ED TO THE NAME OF THE PARTY AND THE CHARACTER OF THE INSTRUMENT THEREBY ENTIRELY CHANGED AFFORDS AN UNANSWERABLE ARGUMENT IN FAVOR OF REQUIRING THE RECOGNITION IN THE BODY OF THE INSTRUMENT AS THE ADDITION OF THE SEAL MAY CREATE A LIEN ON THE REALTY AS IT OPERATES AN ESTOPPEL AND CONCLUDES THE PARTY FROM DENYING THE CONSIDERATION OF QUESTIONING THE FACTS SET FORTH IN THE INSTRUMENT AS IT ELEVATES THE CONTRACT TO THE DIGNITY OF A SPECIALTY IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF ASSETS AS IT EXCLUDES THE PROTECTION OF THE ACT OF LIMITATIONS AS IT IS SO EASY TO ADD A SEAL FRAUDULENTLY WITHOUT RISQUE OF DE TECTION AND AS THE PROOF OF HANDWRITING IN THE ABSENCE OF SUBSCRIBING WITNESSES IS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT PROOF OF SEALING AND DELIVERY I THINK IT WISE TO REQUIRE A RECOGNITION OF THE SEAL BY THE INSTRUMENT ITSELF INSTEAD OF TRUSTING THE PROOF OF SO IMPORTANT A FACT TO THE SLIPPERY MEMORY OF WITNESSES466 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER SEPT WVILL A SCROLL SERVE AS A SEALWHETHER A SCROLL MAY SERVE AS A CORPORATE SEAL IN VIRGINIA HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED SECTION 2841 OF THE CODE PROVIDES ANY WRITING TO WHICH A NATURAL PERSON MAKING IT SHALL AFFIX A SCROLL BY WAY OF SEAL SHALL BE OF THE SAME FORCE AS IF IT WERE ACTUALLY SEALED THE INMPRESSION OF A CORPORATE OR AN OFFICIAL SEAL ON PAPER OR PARCHMENT ALONE SHALL BE AS VALID AS IF MADE ON WAX OR OTHER ADHESIVE SUBSTANCE COMMENTING ON THIS SECTION PROF LILE SAYS BY STRONG INFERENCE THIS STATUTE EXCLUDES THE USE OF A SCROLL AS A CORPORATE SEAL THE INFERENCE IS WEAKENED HOWEVER BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT AT THE TIME THIS STATUTE WAS ORIGINALLY DRAWN IT WAS THE ACCEPTED DOCTRINE THAT WAX OR SOME OTHER TENACIOUS SUBSTANCE WAS A SINIE QUA NON OF A CORPORATE SEAL AND THE EVIDENT PURPOSE WAS TO RELAX RATHER THAN TO PRESERVE THE COMMON LAW TECHNICALI TIES OF THE SEAL 5 VA L R 333 IN A NOTE TO THIS SECTION BY THE REVISERS OF THE CODE IT IS SAID IT IS IN CIDENT TO EVERY CORPORATION TO HAVE A COMMON OR CORPORATE SEAL IT MAY MAKE OR USE WHAT SEAL IT WILL ANGELL AND AMES ON CORPORATIONS 151 REPORT OF REVISERS P 74 PROF M P BURKS SAYS IT IS WORTHY OF OBSERVATION   THAT NOWHERE DOES THE STATUTE DECLARE THAT THE SCROLL OF A CORPORATION AFFIXED BY WAY OF SEAL SHALL HAVE THE EFFECT OF A SEAL THIS IS DECLARED AS TO NATURAL PERSONS BUT NOT AS TO CORPORATIONS    IT IS SIMPLY DECLARED THAT THE IMPRESSION MAY BE MADE ON PAPER INSTEAD OF WAX BUT IT SEEMS TO ASSUME THAT THERE MUST BE AN IMPRESSIONNOT A MERE STAMP OR SCROLL 3 VA L R

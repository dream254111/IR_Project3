j100077,The American Political Science Review,1946066,Legislative Reference for Congress,i333491,Legislative Reference for Congress During the past fiscal year the Library of Congress has had available an appropriation for legislative reference service Such a service is familiar in the several States in connection with the work of the state legislatures Experiment of it in connection with a national legislature is novel The appropriation read to enable the librarian of Congress to em ploy competent persons to prepare such indexes digests andcompila tions of law as may be required for Congress or other official use and the sum granted was a lump sum25000 The description however of the service as the preparation of indexes digests and compilations of law was merely by way of coupling the undertaking with one main tained previously for a half dozen years 19061911 under this phrase ology and thus to avoid a point of order against the item as new legis lation The result of the earlier work done under a much smaller grant was the preparation merely of an index to the general and per manent law in the federal statutes down through 1907 In reviving the phraseology the proposers of the new undertaking had no thought of limiting the field to law nor the product to indexes digests and com pilations though the last term is broad enough to include almost every kind of a statement that would be prepared by a Legislative Reference Bureau They had in mind a situation that confronts every legisla tive body the need of data sought out digested and brought to bear upon a particular subject The amount of such data to be considered in the adequate determination of legislation for a State is no small one IThe data furnished by a legislative reference bureau are of course only such as may be yielded by material in print ie secondary sources They are not sought in the field or laboratory as are the data sought by an inves tigating commission such as that on industrial relations A legislative ref erence bureau undertaking original investigations of this latter sorteg by taking testimony or canvassing for mere opinionruns the peril of two criti cisms 1 of embarking in projects for which it is not equipped and 2 of promoting mere partisanshipLEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 543 for in addition to the history and theory of the subject it includes neces sarily the experience of other States and optionally in certain subjects the experience of foreign countries The amount to be considered by our federal legislature includes all of this and more in that the experi ence of foreign countries must necessarily be considered and the sub jects themselves are both broader in range and more intricate In large degree the data exist in printed sources They exist in large part in the collections of the Library of Congress But they are scattered there through over two million volumes in numerous languages They are expressed in various ways intelligible only to an expert And to search them out to compare them to  reduce them requires not merely ordi nary familiarity with the use of books and an adequate linguistic train ing but a special technique To identify them promptly requires also a special apparatus in the way of guides and indexes Accessible this mass of material has always been but without these aids it has not been for the legislator fully available The committees of Congress have competent clerks each senator and representative also a competent secretary But neither the time nor the ability of these suffices for the search of these foreign sources Nor does the time even if the ability of the senator or representative himself His need is indicated in the complaint of a senator last fall he had asked for certain informa tion and we had only sent him some books The information was to be sure in the books sent The specific passages were even marked But he hadnt time to draw them off digest and compare them He wanted this done for him and he thought he had a right to ask it The passages were all in English Had they been in a foreign tongue there would be the further need of a translation If they included a table of statistics he would want this reproduced so as to avoid the encumbrance of a heavy volume and substitute for it a single sheet to be inserted in his manuscript To supply these conveniences is not the ordinary function of a library A library undertakes merely to supply the books with such suggestion as to the sources appropriate to the inquiry as may be within its abilities The information thus furnished is bibliographic information Hav ing furnished it the library leaves the actual research and utilization of it to the inquirer himself The one step furtherto make the search to assemble the data and to digest compare and apply these to the sub ject of the inquiryis the service expected of a legislative reference bureau Our appropriation was available with the beginning of the fiscal544 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW yearJuly 1 As however the demand would be slight until the be ginning of the regular session in December the full organization of the staff was postponed until then Certain preliminaries were however desirable in particular a consideration of questions pending which were likely to receive attention during the session These might be indi cated 1 in the program outlined by or in behalf of the administration 2 by the announced programs of certain major committees 3 by bills actually pending in one House which had passed the other and 4 by other bills pending which were likely to be passed even in a short session Among the subjects of legislation thus clearly in prospect were 1 the conservation bills socalled 2 the merchant marine 3 the gov ernment of the Philippines 4 immigration On some of these one House had already acted There were also in the same category bills relating to convictmade goods to railroad securities to federal aid in roadmaking to a bureau of labor safety and to publicity in campaign contributions Among the subjects in which the administration had expressed interest was that of a national budget system To anticipate the demand for data on these subjects and to iden tify and so far as practicable actually assemble the source material in advance was the natural course and it was adopted In only one subject however was an attempt made to draw off and digest the data This was in relation to the budget The demand here was likely to be for a description of budget systems in foreign countries A descriptive account of these was therefore undertaken beginning with Great Britain As to other subjects the response awaited the demand the character and angle of which could not well be anticipated One other preliminary was obvious that is to consider the field of each of the major committees of Congress and to assign each field or the several contiguous fields to some one of the staff who should give it special study and be specially responsible for the treatment of it If not a specialist in the subject matter such an employee would at least become one in his knowledge of the sources and his familiarity with the apparatus for the ready use of them He would inform him self as to what exists in print recommend material to be acquired and acquaint himself with guides indexes and the other aids to quick and certain reference All of such material and aids in the various executive and scientific departments and bureaus were of course to be noted and if available in printed form to be assembled as part of the apparatus of the divisionLEGISLATIVE NOTES AN REVIEWS 545 Demands certain to be expected would involve our own federal statutes A complete detailed and scientific index to these would there fore be essential Now such an index did not exist One compiled was issued in 1906 but it consisted merely of a consolidation of the indexes to the biennial volumes The index prepared by our previous corps and issued in 1908 did attempt to be both scientific and detailed It was based on a set of schedulessubject headingsprepared in ad vance and submitted for criticism The two volumes issued covered however only the period to 1908 and merely the permanent and gen eral law It needed to be brought to date and to be complemented by an index to the private and local acts many of which contain pro visions of general import beyond the occasion or the locality A group of indexers applied specifically to this work was accordingly organized and has pursued steadily the construction of these indexes as part of the necessary permanent apparatus of the division With the session the particular demands began to come in Their interest is in their character and range but also in relation to the appre hensions expressed by opponents of the service itself For from the time such a service here was suggested there have been such opponents Some protested that its effect would be to turn the library into a bill factory Their objection was met by the entire elimination from the project of bill drafting which is a feature of state legislative service and which was urged here Others foresaw in the services a mass of material of trifling public import which would be fed into the Record in the form of speeches either wholly partisan or at most conducing rather to the personal vanity of the legislator than to the efficiency of legislation Others anticipated demands purely private local or per sonal which would exhaust its energies without in the least advancing the business of legislation The actual demands during the three months of the session may be grouped as follows for digests or compilations of federal or state statute or constitutional law on various subjects for comparative studies compilations abstracts or translations of foreign law or decrees on various subjects for compilations on certain questions of legislative proceduredomestic and foreign for translations and compilations on certain subjects in international law for digests and compilations on powers of the executivein Canada France and Germanyover the tariff for statistical information on some nineteen subjects foreign and domestic for extracts furnished in the form of photostat reproductions of various articles in newspapers or periodicals for lists of bills intro546 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW duced on certain subjects for memoranda on bills pending eg the construction of certain words or phrases the history of previous legis lation on the same subject precedents from other jurisdictions or the record of subjects within the field of two or more committees for bib liographic memoranda on certain subjects and for reports or memo randa involving miscellaneous reference work in cooperation with other divisions of the library There were some seventeen of the last de scribed Practically all were pertinent to questions before or likely to come before Congress even if not involved in legislation actually pend ing This summary indicates the range of the work but not its dimensions for while some of the inquiries could be answered in an hour and a single typewritten page others required several weeks of research and a state ment covering fifty pages A detailed list of the subjects dealt with is not feasible here An examination of it would be suggestive as indicating how far the actual demands upon the service have justified the apprehensions expressed Of demands purely personal to the legislator the number has been sur prisingly small at most three or four All of the others if not related to legislation actually pending or in prospect did relate to matters of proper concern to a legislator the analysis or interpretation of particular statutes or of statutes dealing with certain subject matter in which a member of Congress might have a justifiable interest Of this descrip tion were for instance the various demands for the State laws on vari ous subjects Of major importance in themselves and most distinctive in the service required were the questions involving foreign or inter national law These alone would have required a service such as this The number of them small during a single short session must of course increase with the increased participation of the United States in the af fairs of the world and the inevitable participation of Congress and of individual members of Congress in the discussion and determination of the attitude of the United States upon these affairs This latter par ticipation creates a situation here not paralleled in any country with a responsible ministry In such a country it may be sufficient that the ministry shall be informed in ours the minority as well as the majority and each member of both minority and majority is entitled to be Where there is a responsible ministry the information is supplied by experts who are part of the permanent executive establishment In our case the initiative in legislation may be taken by a single member of Congress the legislation may even be carried through in opposition toLEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 547 the administration And the data required even if in the possession of the executive may not be seasonably available It is important that they should be in the hands of the member before he takes the initia tive or in any way announce his purpose An understanding of them may enable him to shape his proposal to better advantage It may induce him to abandon it wholly In either case he should have it The situation at Washington differs therefore from that at a capital where all the initiative is taken by a responsible ministry and the data required by the minority are employed only for the purpose of criticism Prominent during the past session were questions arising out of the war Exportation of munitions the military and naval expenditures of various countries including the United States during the past quarter century transfer of flag contraband exportation and destination of copper protest suppression of liquor traffic the London conference neutrality The discussion of the seamens bill called for compilations upon the wages of seamen in foreign countries and that on the ship purchase bill for the legislation of foreign countries in aid or govern mental control of a merchant marine The legislation of Russia on this latter subject seeming especially apposite this section of the com pilation was printed as a committee document It played little if any part in the discussion In a question so large as the one involved however the value of data is not always to be tested by the immediate affirmative use to which they are put That much of the data actually quoted in debate went merely to swell the pages of the Record must be admitted that much was desired and employed for purposes merely partisan goes without saying Both are true of the books called for from the library itself The compensation is that the data sought for and supplied in this way will be apt to be more accurate than that fed into the record without the aid of such a service The personnel of the staff includes men trained in law and research its spirit and methods are scientific its object is to state the facts and so far as conclusions are ventured the truth If the legislator uses only that portion of the facts which will support his argument that is his affair as the argument itself is his affair His opponent has an equal opportunity to secure the opposing facts upon which to base an opposing argument The omission from the services as legalised of any provision for bill drafting did not prevent some requests for aid in this In two or three cases the aid was given but informally and merely as the personal suggestion of someone of the staff brought into personal relation with548 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the legislator I refer of course to the actual final shaping of the bill expert control of which is so earnestly urged by publicists considering the machinery of legislation Preliminary aid of various sorts is within the regular scope of the service It may for instance report what is the existing law on a given subject and how this has been construed by the courts and what rules regulations and decisions have been made under it by an executive department In reading through the federal statutes and in the course of their work they will have read through every one of them from the beginning to date its corps of indexers note the usual form for any bill clause or paragraph of common occurrence also the particular word or phrase employed to effect a cer tain purpose These notes are at the disposal of any member And the material the reference bureau accumulates as part of its apparatus may prove serviceable to him in other ways for instance in determining whether the administrative features of his bill conform to existing de partmental machinery whether the references to existing statutes are exact and what existing statutes if any should be specifically mentioned in the repealing clause Such service would be merely auxiliary The member still deter mines what is to be carried by the bill and he draws the bill The proposal to provide Congress with a corps of expert bill drafters con tinues to arouse opposition and some resentment the extreme of which was expressed by one senator who declared that a senator who couldnt draw a bill ought to give up his seat On the other hand our legisla tive service was criticised on the floor of the House on the very ground that instead of drafting bills it merely made compilations The opponents admit that bill drafters may be useful to the state legislators but the members of Congress are they point out men of larger caliber more mature and more experienced Most of them are lawyers Nor is it important they say that the bills introduced be properly drawn as ninetynine onehundredths of them fail on their merits and never get beyond a committee while those of them which are actually reported have been threshed out in committee and will later be threshed out further on the floor by skilled parliamentarians eager to take advantage of every error in form as well as of substance On the whole the situation as to bill drafting at Washington seems to be this that a certain number of members of each House experts in legislation do not need the service others might profit by it but do not desire it and the rest desire it very keenly The last group include many men of experience and legal training They would not admitLEGISLATIVE NOTES AND REVIEWS 549 themselves incompetent to draft a bill if that were their only busi ness but they recognize that in their absorption in the substance of a measure they may very possibly overlook some defect in the form which might appear to a critic considering merely the form and they would not imperil the substance by a defect in the mere form They would take no chances Obviously federal statutemaking could not lose and it might gain by the service to Congress of a corps of experts who would at some stage consider the structure and phraseology of bills in the same way as do the parliamentary counsel in England But the stage at which their aid might profitably be invoked would be when the bill is otherwise ready to come out of a committee and again before its final adoption by either House Such a corps would utilize the resources of the legis lative reference bureau but it need not form part of it The library itself has recommended that if established it be attached directly to Congress as part of the legislative establishment Meantime the appropriation for legislative reference work proper has been continued for another year under a phraseology amplified and made general as follows Legislative reference To enable the librarian of Congress to employ competent persons to gather classify and make available in transla tions indexes digests compilations and bulletins and otherwise data for or bearing upon legislation and to render such data serviceable to Congress and committees and members thereof 25000

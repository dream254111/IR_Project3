j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099366,Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Co v Jennings Decided at Richmond February 8 1900,i245870,1900 DIGEST OF OTHER RECENT VIRGINIA DECISIONS securities of a foreign insurance company doing business in this State cannot be garnished by a foreign creditor of the company He holds such bonds or securities first for the people of Virginia designated by law and then for the company When its liabilities to citizens of this State have been satisfied or terminated the securi ties deposited must be delivered to the company The fact that the company has made an assignment or that a suit has been brought pursuant to section 1274 of the Code to enforce the rights of creditors does not in any wise alter the rule Nor can such garnishment be supported merely by uniting the obligors in the bonds deposited with the treasurer HENDERSON V COMMONWEALTHDecided at Richmond January 25 1900Harrison J 1 BURGLARY HousebreakingPossession of goods recently stolenPresumption The presumption of burglary or housebreaking does not arise from the mere pos session of goods recently theretofore stolen from a house that was broken and en tered for that purpose Such possession however is a most material circumstance to be considered in connection with other inculpatory circumstances 2 IIoUSEBREAKINGIndictmentOwnership of houseEvidence Upon an in dictment charging the prisoner with breaking and entering the storehouse of A and B composing the firm of A B proof of the breaking and entering the store house of A B is sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty without showing the names of the individuals who composed the firm or other particulars as to the ownership of the storehouse 3 CRIMINAL PROCEDUREVerdictCertainty A verdict in a criminal case is always to be read in connection with the indictment and if upon such reading the meaning of the verdict is certain that is sufficient RIVERSIDE COTTON MILLS V GREENDecided at Richmond Feb ruary 1

JAMES RIVER AND KANAWHA CANALAct author izing sameSubsequent tort by purchaserJurisdiction Sections 3 and 4 of the Act 855856 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April approved February 27 1879 Acts 18789 p 119 relating to the sale of the property of the James River  Kanawha Canal Company to the Richmond  Alleghany Railroad Company were intended to cover actions to enforce the con tract authorized by said act for the transfer of the property of the former com pany to the latter brought by parties to the contract or persons directly interested in its enforcement and has no relation to torts thereafter inflicted by the pur chaser of the property or its successors There is nothing in said act to deprive local courts of jurisdiction over suits for sueh torts committed within their terri torial limits 2 BRIDGEObligation to maintainCase at bar The obligation to maintain and keep in repair the bridge mentioned in the declaration in this cause arises out of the interference by the James River  Kanawha Canal Company with the highway and not as a condition on which the franchises were granted that comn pany and hence is a continuing obligation on the successors of that company so long as such interference continues 3 BRIDGE IN HIGHWAYPrivate benefitObligation to maintain Where a bridge in a public highway is rendered necessary by the private use of the high way and it is built for private benefit no presumption of acceptance of it by the public to be maintained at public expense arises from its free and open use by the public 4 NEGLIGENCEFast riding over bridge Riding over a bridge faster than a walk though unlawful is not negligence per se Whether or not the gait or speed was in the particular case negligence and if so whether it contributed to the injury received on the bridge are questions for the jury 5 NEGLIGENCEStatutes against fast riding on bridgeStatutes for public safety The statute prohibiting persons from riding over a bridge faster than a walk was enacted for the preservation of bridges and on questions of negligence stands on a different footing from the statutes enacted for the public safety 6 NEGLIGENCEViolation oJ lawEffect on act It is not contributory negli gence per se for the injured party at the time of the injury to be engaged in a violation of the law Such violation does not put him out of the protection of the law nor at the mercy of others But if such violation contributed to his in jury he cannot recover therefor 7 NEGLIGENCEProximate cause Negligence no matter of what it consists cannot create a cause of action unless it is the proximate cause of the injury com plained of The two must concur PAINTER AND OTHERS V ST CLAIR AND OTHERSDecided at Rich mond February 8 1900Keith P 1 APPEAL AND ERROR Roads Injunction Condemnation

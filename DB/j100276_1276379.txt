plaintiff for a writ of mandamus to compel the defendant dis trict judge to reinstate and proceed with the case stated below The plain tiff had commenced suit by attachment in a justice court against a nonresi dent defendant The only service was by publication of summons Judg ment was rendered against the defendant by default and his property seized under the attachment was sold Subsequently the defendant appeared spec ially and moved to have the judgment vacated for want of jurisdiction of the person The defendants motion was denied and he took a general appeal to the district court The district court having erroneously discharged the at tachment dismissed the case for want of jurisdiction of the defendants person The statute provided that all cases appealed to the district court shall be heard anew in said court Held the appeal constituted a general ap pearance and mandamus should issue H L Griffin Co v Howell Judge I911  Utah  113 Pac 326 The decision in the principal case follows the general rule on this sub ject McCubrey v Lankis 74 Minn 302 When as in the principal case a general appeal is taken from a justice court judgment the cause will ordinar ily be tried anew upon its merits Gant v Chi etc R R Co 79 Mo 502 Thus it becomes immaterial whether the court appealed from had jurisdic tion of the person or not Foster v Borne et al 63 Ohio St I69 Also an appeal to a court of review from a judgment void for want of jurisdiction over the person constitutes a general appearance Chesapeake etc R R Co v Heath 87 Ky 651 Io Ky L Rep 646 9 S W 832 The appellant will be conclusively presumed to have notice of and therefore must follow all sub sequent proceedings had in the cause or suffer for his default Louisville  N R Co v Chestnut  Bro II5 Ky 43 But it has been held that such a general appeal does not constitute a waiver of any defect of jurisdiction over the person existing at the time the judgment was rendered and that such want or defect is ground for a reversal by the reviewing court Zim merman v Gerdes o06 Wis 608 BANKRUPTCYSUIT BY TRUSTEERIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURYSuit was brought by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover the value of certain goods al leged to have been fraudulently transferred by the bankrupt the defendant in the case as executor to himself and his wife individually The case was noticed for trial upon the calendar for jury trials in the Supreme Court of New York but was transferred to the Special Term and tried without a jury The trustee in bankruptcy made demand for a jury but it was denied on the ground that the action was one in equity Upon appeal on this ground to the New York Court of Appeals held that the plaintiff was entitled to a trial by jury Allen v Gray I9II  N Y  25 Am B R 423 Under the Bankruptcy Act of I898

cY  406 The constitutional right to jury trial extends only to actions at law and not to suits in equity In re Christensen IOI Fed 243 4 Am B R 99 In re Rude IOI Fed 805 4 Am B R 319 As to whether a suit by a trustee in bankruptcy to recover property fraudulently conveyed or its value must be brought in equity or may be either in law or equity there has been some difference of opinion among the courts The question in the principal case arose under  70e of the Bankruptcy Act of I898 which provides that trustees may recover property fraudulently conveyed or its value in certain cases A similar question has arisen under  60 b of the Act relating to pre ferences On the one hand a number of courts adhere to the view that suits in such cases have always been in equity and a suit in equity is the only proper remedy Wall v Cox IOI Fed 403 4 Am B R 659 Pond v N Y Ex Bk 124 Fed 992 Io Am B R 343 Parker v Black 143 Fed 560 i6 Am B R 202 On the other hand the view seems to be that the trustee

sidering that the remedy of the trustee in such cases may be either at law or in equity the decision of the New York Court of Appeals would appear to be correct provided the action in the case can be said to be one at law Evidently the court so considered it In Cohen v Smiall I20 App Div 211 I8 Am B R 817 the court said that when the action by the trustee was to recover a money judgment the action was one at law In Merritt v Halli day 107 App Div 596 95 N Y Supp 331 it was said that where no public record is to be reformed no deed of conveyance to be set aside and all that is desired is the recovery of a sum of money which constructively belongs to the trustee the action is in form and substance an action at law It would seem to follow from the application of these tests that the action in the principal case was one at law and being at law the plaintiff was entitled as a matter of right to a trial by jury BILLS AND NOTESDRAFT BY AGENT ON PRINCIPALNECESSITY OF ACCEPT ANCEThis was a suit on a draft drawn by an agent of the Insurance Com pany on his principal and indorsed to the Bank Plaintiff alleged that the draft had been presented to the defendant drawee that a demand for pay ment had been made and that payment had been refused No acceptance by the drawee was alleged Defendant demurred on the ground that the com plaint did not state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action Held that the rule previously obtaining has not been changed by the Neg Ins Law to the effect that a draft drawn by an agent on his principal by author ity of the principal is equivalent to a draft drawn by the principal on itself and need not be accepted by the drawee in order to bind it First Nat Bank of Artesia v Home Ins Co New York 1911  N Mex  113 Pac 8I5 This case is at least one

WILLIAM DRAPER LEWIS PHD Dean of the Law School University of Pennsylvania Philadelphia The Court of Appeals in New York has just rendered a deci sion declaring unconstitutional the Workmens Compensation Act in that state the ground of the decision being that the act deprives employers of their property without due process of law The action of the highest court of the first state in the Union shows the serious nature of the constitutional problem involved in any attempt to meet present conditions by a compensation act or in other words by an act which throws in whole or in part on the owners of the business the financial loss resulting from all accidents to employees occurring in the course of the business and incident thereto The constitutional limitation that a person cannot be deprived of his life liberty or property without due process of law is not only in the Federal Constitution as a limitation on federal and state action but in one form or another is found in practically all our state constitutions On the other hand the decision of one court on a particular act even though as in this case the language of the court is sweeping enough to condemn all similar legislation is very far from being conclusive of the question of constitutionality If a decision on a new and important question of constitutional law is fundamentally sound it lasts if unsound while it may not be formally overruled it comes in time to be practically disre garded Indeed if this were not true our written constitutions would rapidly become intolerable fetters upon the expression of the reasonable desires of the people The famous decision of the New York Court of Appeals in 1885 that an act which prohibited the manufacture of tobacco in tenement houses was unconstitutional because it had no relation to the promotion of public health and therefore arbitrarily deprived the owners of such houses of a reasonable use of their property would probably not now be fol lowed by any court except possibly the court which decided it be cause today courts would recognize that the legislature of New I 9120 The Annals of the American Academy York was right and the Court of Appeals wrong not on a matter of law but on a matter of factthe use of tenement houses for the manufacture of tobacco being as a matter of fact peculiarly deleterious to health The matter of Jacobs 98 New York 98 In the BakeShop Casea decision of the Supreme Court of the United States Lochner vs New York I98 U S 45 an act of the State of New York limiting the hours of the laborers in bakeries to sixty per week was declared unconstitu tional as arbitrarily depriving the workmen of their right to con tract This case was supposed to threaten all legislation designed to limit the hours of labor except peculiarly exhausting employments But today since the decision of the same court in the Oregon case Muller vs Oregon 208 U S 412 the BakeShop Case is be lieved to stand merely for the proposition that legislation limiting the hours of labor must be shown to be reasonably designed to protect the health of the laborer There are grounds for believing that the constitutional prohibi tion against depriving persons of life liberty or property without due process of law as originally used in the fifth amendment of the Federal Constitution limited merely arbitrary executive action and perhaps legislation establishing arbitrary modes of legal pro cedure but as used in the fourteenth amendment and in the state constitutions as a prohibition on state legislation it has been definitely decided to extend far beyond this and to limit arbitrary legislation of any kind whether affecting procedure or substantive right In short as a result of this provision in our constitutions the sys tem of law under which we live is practically this The legislature has a wide discretion to change the law and enact new law but the sphere of this discretion has limits legislation that affects private rights and which shocks existing conceptions of what is funda mentally fair and right is not within the power of a legislature to enact such legislation deprives persons of their liberty and prop erty without due process of law and the courts are when a case is presented to them the sole and only judges of what is or is not contrary to fundamental conceptions of fairness and right This system is peculiar to the United States There is much to be said for and much to be said against it I do not wish to discuss that broad question For us it is only presently important to recognize clearly that as a result of the system the task of the lawyer calledConstitutional Problem of Workmens Compensation 121 upon to defend any novel legislation is to convince the court that the legislature has not so far exceeded an admittedly wide discre tion as to produce an arbitrary interference with current funda mental conceptions of right It follows therefore that the task of supporting such a sweeping innovation of the law as a workmens compensation act becomes impossible unless the lawyers in charge of the defense of the legislation can show that the act is consistent throughout with a theory which is not as a theory necessarily revolting to men accustomed to mix as our judges are to some extent with all classes but more especially with the educated welltodo The result of the recent litigation in New York shows the dif ficulty of supporting a workmens compensation act unless those especially interested have in their own minds carefully worked out a theory justifying the legislation The principal innovation in the law created by any such act is that it imposes liability on the em ployer where he is without fault and where he exercises every pos sible degree of care When such legislation is proposed or de fended those who advocate it must be prepared to answer the ob jection that the legislation is merely a scheme for arbitrarily trans ferring money from the pockets of the most convenient rich man the employerto the pockets of the injured employee and that it is therefore grossly arbitrary unfair and unconstitutional It was I think most unfortunate that the New York act was limited to workmen engaged in dangerous employments because this limita tion suggested a reply to the objection just stated that is wholly inadequate It was argued that the act was merely an ordinary exer cise of the police power over dangerous occupations the argument being that if an occupation was dangerous under the police power it could be stopped entirely and therefore any regulation however arbitrary was within the power of the legislation to enact The premise on which this argument is based is more than doubtful For instance the act was made to apply to work on scaffolds more than twenty feet from the ground yet an act which prohibited the erection of such scaffolds would without doubt be held to be un constitutional as an arbitrary limitation on the use of property Again if the act was designed to lessen accidents or improve the conditions under which dangerous work could be carried on why was the employer made liable for all accidents occurring in theThe Annals of the American Academy course of the business whether due to its dangerous character or not Lastly if the dangerous character of the employment and the reduction of accident is the justification for the legislation what is the justification for making the employer liable when he is doing everything anyone could do to make the conditions safe and the workman himself is negligent The report of the Wainwright Commission which drafted the New York act while containing much valuable information and an excellent indictment of the present system cannot be said to con tain a complete justification for the particular remedy embodied in the act After reciting the evils of the present system the com mission in its report to the legislature states that the evils of the present system can be best avoided by compelling the employer to share the accident burden in intrinsically dangerous trades since by fixing the price of his product the shock of the accident may be borne by the community By the community is here evidently meant the consumers of the product But while the ability of the owners of the business to transfer the share of the burden of indus trial accidents placed upon them on the consumer is indicated there is no explanation of why the burden should be ultimately borne by the consumer of a product and therefore no adequate reason for selecting the employer even though he is the only medium for distributing the shock Is there then any adequate answer to the objection that the New York act and all similar legislation are grossly arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional In order to answer this question it is first necessary to under stand exactly what a workmens compensation act does It provides that one of the costs of the business the loss resulting from injury to employees should hereafter to a certain extent be borne by the owner and controller of the business The law is not a police regu lation of dangerous occupations It is a law regulating business asso ciation contracts between employer and employee A law which merely said that anyone who employed another in his business should unless he stipulated to the contrary be presumed to have contracted to pay that other for all injuries resulting from the operation of the business would be constitutional but the ability to contract out would make it largely useless The real question then in a workmens compensation act is this What is the justi 122Constitutional Problem of Workmens Compensation I23 fication for saying to an employer and employee if you contract you must contract on the basis of the employer being liable in whole or in part as the act may designate for injuries occurring to the employee in the prosecution of the business Any act dealing with a class of transactions which merely changes the presumptions of fact in regard to obligations assumed where the obligation is not touched on by express contract is constitutional but any act which goes further and interferes with the complete freedom of contract must have a reasonable theory to justify the interference or the courts will say and rightly that it interferes with the fundamental right to freedom of contract of the persons affected The prob lem of finding this reason is not a legal problem but an economic one The judges are not economists It is not for them to invent economic reasons to justify legislation The economic justification of a workmens compensation act will be found on investigation to be the same as the economic justification for laws against monopoly Laws against monopoly interfere with the freedom of contract where that freedom is exer cised to produce monopoly yet their constitutionality has always been sustained We have come to recognize that the monopoly by one set of men of any product or service is a bad thing for the com munity When a monopoly exists the producers that is the per sons who have the monopoly have the practical power to exact from the consumers more than a reasonable cost of production and a fair return on the investment The holder of a monopoly is able to get part of the product of the labor of somebody else for noth ing The reason why laws against monopoly though they invari ably interfere with the freedom of contract have never been de clared unconstitutional is the general recognition of the funda mental economic law that it is disastrous to the state to have the consumers of a particular product pay more than the cost of pro duction and a fair profit and that contracts tending to produce this result can be prohibited In this justification for statutes interfering with the freedom of the contract where the contract produces monopoly we have I be lieve as stated the justification for a workmens compensation act The accidents which occur from time to time to the machinery used in business have long been regarded as one of the elements which enter into the cost of production We have only recently awakThe Annals of the American Academy ened to the fact that another cost of production is the loss of earn ing power entailed by accidents to persons engaged in the business due to the operation of the business This cost at present is borne largely by the workmen It is not a part of the employers cost except in the case of his negligence It is therefore not part of the cost of production which is transferred in the price of the finished article to the consumer The injustice of the present system is not that the employer does not pay for the result of injuries to his workmen Competition among employers cuts down the employers profit to a business return on his investment The injustice lies in the fact that the consumer of the finished product or the user of the service which the business supplies is not paying for all the elements which make up the cost of that which he is getting The consumer is here in a position analogous to the position of the monopolist He is reaping an unfair advantage He is getting some part of the product of anothers labor without paying the full cost If it is sound that the consumer of any article should not bear more than the cost of production and a profit it is equally sound that to have the consumer pay only a part of the cost of the fin ished product the rest of the cost being borne by one or all of the classes who have joined in its production is an equally bad con dition Whether we should throw the burden of an accident in a particular business on the business in which it occurs or dis tribute the burden by an insurance system supported by all those engaged in a similar business is a matter of detail provided we recognize the fact that any industrial system which does not in effect throw every element of cost on the consumer of the finished product is a system that is as radically defective as one which in effect by permitting monopoly of production to exist throws on the consumer more than the cost of production Monopoly raises a class above its deserts taking a little from each of the many to support the few Our present system of dealing with industrial accidents is a system by which the many take from the dependent classes more than they give in return Monopoly inflates those already economically strong our present industrial accident law and its administration depresses those already economically weak The fundamental vice is the same in bothan unfair price paid by the consumer unfair because too high or unfair because too low Having thus justified from an economic point of view placing I24Constitutional Problem of Workmens Compensation I25 the burden of industrial accidents on the consumer it merely re mains to refer again to the obvious fact pointed out by the Wain wright Commission in its report that the owner and controller of the business is the only medium through which the burden of the cost of these accidents can be placed on the consumer The owner of the business owns the completed product and all elements of cost to him he may transfer to the consumer in the price of the product The justification for saying to an employer and employee if you contract you must contract on the basis of the employers assuming the burden of industrial accident is thus seen to be as stated economically the same as the justification of legislation which pro hibits a contract creating a monopoly There is however this difference between a contract of an employer and employee in which the employer does not assume the financial burden of accidents incident to the operation of his business and a contract creating a monopoly The latter contract creates a condition which renders the oppressed parties the consumers helpless They must have the article and to have it they must pay an exorbitant price The oppressed party where the contract is between the employer and employee is the employeeone of the parties to the contract To uphold the constitutionality of any legislation which prohibits the employer making a certain contract with his employee on the ground that the result of the contract is an unfair oppression of the em ployee from an economic point of view it must not only be shown that economically the contract is unfair but it should also be shown that the employees are so dependent that they are not in a position to refuse to enter into the contract That a contract is unfair to one party from an economic and social standpoint is probably not sufficient to enable the legislature to interfere where the unfair ness is to one of the parties to the contract and not to third persons As indicated in such a case it must also be shown that the parties on whom it bears unfairly are in a position where they practically have to accept the unfair contract As an illustration The pay ments of miners wages in store orders is regarded by many persons as a condition tending to depress the miner and therefore econom ically unfair to him A law prohibiting such a contract was in I886 declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania as an undue interference with the freedom of contract GodcharlesThe Annals of the Americanl Academy vs Wigeman I13 Pa 431 the laborer being regarded by the court as able to take care of himself An opposite conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of the Knoxville Iron Company vs Harbison I83 U S 13 a case decided in I9OI Though the language of the two courts indicates apparently a wide divergence in attitude towards such legislation fundamentally the difference would appear to be in the apprehen sion of what were the true facts rather than a difference in the principle the Supreme Court realized what the court of Pennsyl vania as then constituted failed to realize that the laborers were not economically strong enough to insist on payment in money If therefore workmen engaged in manual labor are not as a matter of fact usually strong enoughand I think this can be shown to refuse work unless the employer assumes the risk of accidents in the business and it is fundamentally fair for the reasons given that the employer should assume this risk then a workmens com pensation act with a clause against contracting out applicable to the more dependent classes of workmen that is to those engaged in manual pursuits is constitutional It is constitutional even though it interferes with the freedom of contract for the same fundamental reason that laws prohibiting monopolies are constitu tional though they also interfere with the same freedom In this paper I have tried to show that the constitutional prob lem in a workmens compensation act is the problem of showing that such an act is not fundamentally unfair to the employer ac cording to current conceptions of fundamental right and that therefore the first thing to do is to find out whether there is a correct economic basis for the legislation If this basis cannot be found then the legislation will be and should be declared unconsti tutional I have also tried to point out what I believe to be the economic reason which justifies such legislation But in spite of confidence in the correctness of the economic position taken I would not be fair to myself if I left you with the impression that the proof of the reasonableness of the legislation from an economic point of view removed all difficulty It usually does in such cases where the court is convinced of the facts on which the economic argument is based and on the soundness of the argument But in the path of a workmens compensation act where liability is imposed on the owner of the particular business in which the 126Constitutional Problem of Workmens Compensation I27 accident occurred another objection is to be met and overcome There is more or less prevalent among the members of the legal profession and therefore of course among our judges an idea that the common law never imposes liability without fault and that consequently any legislation which imposes liability where there is no fault is arbitrary unfair and therefore unconstitu tional The decision of the Court of Appeals of New York was as a whole based on this thesis Of course the conclusion does not of necessity follow the premise But it is not unnatural that the conclusion should follow in the mind of one who believes in the premise and is imbued with a just admiration of the principles of the common law Personally with respect to those who have an opposite opinion I do not believe that merely because a principle has not been recognized by the common law it is necessarily to be regarded as opposed to fundamental ideas of right And further more I believe it can be shown that the law as developed by our courts without the aid of statutory enactments has recognized the principle that liability may be imposed without fault These however are large legal questions worthy of separate treatment

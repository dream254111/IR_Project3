J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1101692,CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE,I245985,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL XV OCTOBER 1909 NO 6 CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE BY JESSE 1 ORTON A M LL B THE DOCTRINE THAT CORPORATE CHARTERS AND FRANCHISES ARE CON TRACTS AND NOT SUBJECT TO REPEAL HAS BEEN IN SOME MEASURE EVADED IN MANY OF THE STATES BY RESERVATION OF THE POWER OF REPEAL OR AMENDMENT YET THE STATEMENT OF MR COTTON IS STILL TRUE THAT THE DOCTRINE OF THE SACREDNESS OF CHARTERS AND FRANCHISES GROW ING OUT OF THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE DECISION HAS WOVEN ITSELF INTO THE TISSUE OF OUR LAW AS HAS PERHAPS NO OTHER PAPER MADE DOCTRINE OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW ONE OF MARSHALLS EULOGISTS HAS SAID THAT THE EFFECT OF THIS DECISION WAS TO WITHDRAW THE OBLIGATIONS OF CONTRACTS FROM THE POWER OF THE STATE LEGISLATURES TO IMPAIR THEIR VALIDITY AND TO PLACE THEM ALSO BENEATH THE PROTECTING EGIS OF THE CONSTITUTION IN TRUTH IT DID NOTHING OF THE SORT THE PROTECTION OF ORDINARY CONTRACTS FROM IMPAIRMENT BY THE STATES WAS EFFECTIVELY SECURED BY THE WORDS OF THE CONSTITUTION WHAT MARSHALL AND HIS ASSO CIATES DID WAS BY A FORCED AND UNHEARDOF CONSTRUCTION TO IN CLUDE UNDER THE TERM CONTRACTS CERTAIN ACTS OF LEGISLATION WHICH OUGHT TO BE AT ALL TIMES OPEN TO REPEAL OR AMENDMENT THE ROYAL CHARTER GIVEN TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN 1769 PROVIDING THAT THE COLLEGE SHOULD ALWAYS BE GOVERNED BY A SELFPERPETUATING BOARD OF TWELVE TRUSTEES WAS DECLARED TO BE FOREVER BINDING ON THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE UNDER THE CLAUSE IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTIDN FORBIDDING ANY STATE TO PASS LAWS IMPAIRING THE OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTS IT WAS HELD THAT THE LEGISLATURE COULD NOT INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRUSTEES TO TWENTYONE AND PROVIDE TEMPORARILY FOR THE APPOINTMENT OF NEW TRUSTEES BY THE GOV ERNOR AND COUNCIL THE CHIEF QUESTION IN THE CASE WAS THOUGHT TO BE WHETHER THIS INSTITUTION WAS PUBLIC OR PRIVATE THE HIGHEST COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HAD PRONOUNCED IT PUBLIC CHIEF JUSTICE MARSHALL15 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER ADMITTED THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE INSTITUTION WAS PUBLIC THAT EDUCATION IS AN OBJECT OF NATIONAL CONCERN AND THAT THERE MAY BE AN INSTITUTION FOUNDED BY GOVERNMENT AND PLACED ENTIRELY UNDER ITS IMMEDIATE CONTROLTHE OFFICERS OF WHICH WOULD BE PUBLIC OFFICERS AMENABLE EXCLUSIVELY TO GOVERNMENT HIS DECISION WAS BASED ON THE CONCLUSION THAT THIS INSTITUTION WAS FOUNDED BY PRIVATE PARTIES WITH PRIVATE FUNDS AND THAT THE INCORPORATION DID NOT CHANGE ITS CHARACTER EXCEPT TO MAKE IT IMMORTAL AND ITS MANAGEMENT MORE CONVENIENT HE TOOK NO ACCOUNT OF THE PRIN CIPLE DECLARED BY ONE OF HIS SUCCESSORS IN 1876 THAT CERTAIN INSTITUTIONS OR ENTERPRISES CONDUCTED EXCLUSIVELY WITH PRIVATE FUNDS BUT HAVING A PURPOSE AFFECTED WITH A PUBLIC INTEREST ARE PROPER SUBJECTS FOR STATE REGULATION AND CONTROL AMONG THE MISTAKES OF LAW AND FACT CONTAINED IN THE REASON ING OF THE COURT THERE ARE TWO VERY SERIOUS ONES WHICH RELATE TO THE PARTICULAR FACTS OF THIS CASE FIRST DARTMOUTH COLLEGE WAS IN FACT PUBLIC IN ITS FOUNDATION AND ENDOWMENT AS WELL AS IN ITS PURPOSE AND SECOND THE COLLEGE CHARTER CONTAINED NO SUCH CONTRACT AS THE COURT ASSUMED TO FIND AND ENFORCE 1 UNFORTUNATELY COUNSEL FOR THE STATE WERE OUTGENERALED AND DID NOT GET ALL IMPORTANT FACTS INTO THE RECORD SENT TO WASH INGTON BUT MANY ADDITIONAL FACTS WERE BROUGHT TO THE ATTEN TION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN CONNECTION WITH THE THREE ADDITIONAL CASES BEGUN IN THE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT COURT AND CERTAIN MOTIONS MADE BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT IN THE COLLEGE CASE PROPER MR SHIRLEY CONCLUDES THAT MARSHALL KNEW THE ESSENTIAL FACTS THIS AUTHOR SHOWS THAT THE LARGE SUMS OF MONEY COL LECTED IN GREAT BRITAIN AND AMERICA BY ELEAZER WHEELOCK WHICH MARSHALL SAYS WERE PAID TO THE CORPORATION ON THE FAITH OF THE CONTRACT BETWEEN THE DONORS THE TRUSTEES AND THE CROWN WERE NEVER CONTRIBUTED OR PAID TO DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AT ALL BUT TO MOORS INDIAN CHARITY SCHOOL THIS SCHOOL FOUNDED BY WHEELOCK AND ALREADY ENDOWED BY JOSIAH MOOR ALTHOUGH CARRIED ON BY WHEELOCKON THE SAME GROUNDS AS THOSE OCCUPIED BY THE COLLEGE WAS KEPT ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM DARTMOUTH COLLEGE IN MANAGEMENT AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT IT APPEARS ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THE FIRST ENDOWMENT OF THE COLLEGE WAS THE GIFT OF PUBLIC LAND PRESENTED ON BEHALF OF NEW HAMPSHIRE BY JOHN WENTWORTH 418 OCT1909 CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE COLONIAL GOVERNOR SOON AFTER HE ISSUED THE CHARTER OTHER PUB LIC DONATIONS BY THE STATE FOLLOWED AS WELL AS CERTAIN PRIVATE DONATIONS THE MASSIVE STRUCTURE OF CONCLUSIONS BASED BY THE COURT ON THE ALLEGED PRIVATE FOUNDATION FALLS TO THE GROUND THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH AND THE OTHER TRUSTEES IN ENGLAND WHOM MARSHALL NAMES AS PROBABLY THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTORS ON APRIL 25 1771 WROTE TO DR WHEELOCK WE SHALL EXPECT THAT YOU KEEP A REGULAR AND DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF ALL MONEYS LAID OUT IN ERECTING THE SCHOOL EDUCATING INDIAN YOUTHS AND EQUIPPING AND MAINTAINING MISSIONARIES AGREEABLE TO THE DESIGN OF OUR INSTITUTION AND THAT YOU DO NOT BLEND THEM WITH YOUR COLLEGE AND OTHER MATTERS FOREIGN TO AND SEPARATE FROM OUR UNDERTAKING ON NOVEMBER 9 1770 DR WHEELOCK HAD WRITTEN TO ONE OF THESE ENGLISH TRUSTEES THE CHARTER WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO CONVEY THE LEAST POWER OR CONTROL OF ANY FUNDS COLLECTED IN EUROPE NOR DOES IT CONVEY ANY JURISDICTION OVER THE SCHOOL TO THE TRUSTEES OF THE COLLEGE   IF I RESIGN MY OFFICE AS PRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE I YET RETAIN THE SAME RELATION TO THE SCHOOL AND CONTROL OF IT AS EVER IT ISSUPPOSED THAT THE COLLEGE WAS NAMED AFTER THE EARL OF DARTMOUTH INSTEAD OF AFTER GOVERNOR WENTWORTH ITS REAL BEN EFACTOR IN ORDER TO MOLLIFY THE DISPLEASURE FELT BY THE NOBLE EARL AND HIS COTRUSTEES AT WHEELOCKS FAILURE TO STICK TO THE ORIGINAL PLAN AND CONFINE HIS ATTENTION TO THE INDIAN CHARITY SCHOOL A PURELY MISSIONARY ENTERPRISE 2 THE CHIEF JUSTICE SAID IT CAN REQUIRE NO ARGUMENT TO PROVE THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THIS CASE CONSTITUTE A CONTRACT THE CONTRACT WHICH MARSHALL ENFORCED AGAINST THE STATE OF NEW IAMPSHIRE WAS A SUPPOSED AGREEMENT BY THE ENGLISH KING THAT THE CHARTER SHOULD NOT BE REPEALED OR AMENDED IN ESSENTIAL PARTICULARS BY ANY FUTURE LEGISLATIVE ACT BUT THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE CHARLES DOE DELIVERING THE OPINION OF THE NEW HAMP SHIRE SUPREME COURT IN 1886 IN THE CASE OF DOW V RAILROAD COMPANY HAS SHOWN THAT IF GEORGE III HAD ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE CONTRACT WITH MARSHALL ENFORCED HE WOULD PROBABLY HAVE LOST HIS CROWN AND THE AGREEMENT WOULD HAVE BEEN PLAINLY ILLEGAL AND VOID UNDER THE ENGLISH BILL OF RIGHTS OF 1639 AND THE ACT 41915 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER OF SETTLEMENT OF 1701 JAMES II HAD BEEN DEPOSED IN 1688 FOR MAKING CONTRACTS OF THIS SORT THAT IS FOR ASSUMING TO SUSPEND OR NULLIFY THELEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY OF PARLIAMENT WHILE THE COL LEGE CHARTER CONTAINS SUITABLE LANGUAGE TO INDICATE THAT THE GRANT SO FAR AS THE KING WAS CONCERNED WAS TO BE PERMANENT RATHER THAN FOR A TERM OF YEARS AND WOULD NOT BE REVOKED OR CHANGED BY HIM IT CONTAINS NO WORD SUGGESTING THAT THE KING OR HIS AGENT GOVERNOR WENTWORTH HAD ANY INTENTION OF PROMISING EXEMP TION FROM LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY AND CONTROL THE ENGLISH PAR LIAMENT HAS ALWAYS HAD AND ON OCCASION HAS EXERCISED THE POWER TO REPEAL AND AMEND CORPORATE CKARTERS EVEN THOUGH THE SUPREME COURT ERRED IN TREATING DARTMOUTH COLLEGE AS A PRIVATE SCHOOL AND IN ENFORCING A SOCALLED CON TRDCT WHICH NO ONE EVER DREAMED OF MAKING THE QUESTION OF CHIEF IMPORTANCE REMAINS IF A CORPORATION IS PRIVATE IN THE SENSE IN WHICH MARSHALL USED THE TERM AND IF A STATE LEGIS LATURE HAS UNEQUIVOCALLY ATTEMPTED TO MAKE ITS CHARTER AND PRIVILEGES IRREPEALABLE IS SUCH AN ACT A CONTRACT PROTECTED BY THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION FROM CHANGE BY ANY FUTURE LEGISLATURE THE PROHIBITION AGAINST LAWS IMPAIRING THE OBLIGATION OF CON TRACTS HAD ITS ORIGIN IN THE PROVISION OF THE ORDINANCE OF 1787 FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE NORTHWEST TERRITORY TO THE EFFECT THAT NO LAW SHOULD BE MADE INTERFERING WITH OR AFFECTING PRIVATE CONTRACTS OR ENGAGEMENTS PREVIOUSLY FORMED THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION INDICATE THAT THE PURPOSE OF MODIFYING THIS LANGUAGE WAS TO RESTRICT RATHER THAN TO ENLARGE ITS SCOPE VERY IMPORTANT EVIDENCE AS TO THE INTENDED MEANING OF THIS PROVISION IS FOUND IN A REPORT MADE TO THE MARYLAND LEGISLA TURE BY LUTHER MARTIN A DISTINGUISHED MEMBER OF THE CONVENTION FROM THAT STATE HE SAID HE HAD OPPOSED THIS CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE CONSTITUTION BECAUSE HE THOUGHT THE STATES SHOULD HAVE THE POWER IN TIMES OF PUBLIC CALAMITY OR DISTRESS TO PASS LAWS TOTALLY OR PARTIALLY STOPPING THE COURTS OF JUSTICE OR AUTHORIZING THE DEBTOR TO PAY BY INSTALMENTS OR BY DELIVERING UP HIS PROPERTY TO HIS CREDITORS AT A REASONABLE AND HONEST VALUATION THESE WERE THE PRACTICES THERETOFORE COMMON IN THE STATES WHICH THE CLAUSE WAS DESIGNED TO PROHIBIT IF LUTHER MARTIN HAD 420 OCT1909 CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE KNOWN OF ANY CLAIM THAT ITS SCOPE WAS WIDER THAN PRIVATE CON TRACTS AND THAT IT WOULD FORBID THE REPEAL OR ALTERATION OF NUM EROUS LEGISLATIVE ACTS IT IS NOT CONCEIVABLE THAT HE WOULD HAVE NEGLECTED TO STATE THE FACT TO HIS STATE LEGISLATURE IT IS NO MORE CONCEIVABLE THAT SUCH AN INTENDED INVASION OF THE RIGHTS OF THE STATES COULD HAVE CREPT INTO THE CONSTITUTION WITHOUT THE STRONG EST OPPOSITION THAT THE TERM CONTRACTS WAS DESIGNED TO INCLUDE ONLY AGREE MENTS BETWEEN PRIVATE PARTIES IS MOST PROBABLE IF ANY AGREE MENTS BY STATES WERE HELD TO BE CONTRACTS IN THE CONSTITUTIONAL SENSE NONE COULD REASONABLY BE SO INCLUDED EXCEPT AGREEMENTS MADE BY THE STATE IN ITS PRIVATE CAPACITY AS WHEN FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULD BORROW MONEY EMPLOY WORKMEN OR CONTRACT FOR THE ERECTION OF A PUBLIC BUILDING ACTS OF LEGISLATION DONE IN THE PUBLIC CAPACITY OF THE STATE WERE EXCLUDED BY REASON SOUND POLICY AND THE GENERAL UNDERSTANDING OF MEN IF THE POWER OF INDIVIDUALS TO ORGANIZE THEMSELVES INTO A COR PORATION IS NOT TO BE CONSIDERED A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE CONFERRED BY THE STATE BUT IS A COMMON RIGHT REGULATED BY GENERAL LAWS NO LEGISLATIVE ACT RELATING TO INCORPORATION CAN BE CONSIDERED A CONTRACT IT IS ONLY WITH REFERENCE TO SPECIAL POWERS NOT POSSESSED BY ALL CITIZENS IN COMMON THAT THE CONTRACT CLAIM IS MADE BUT IF WE CONCLUDE THAT THE MERE RIGHT TO EXIST AS A CORPORATION IS A FRANCHISE OR SPECIAL PRIVILEGE AND IF WE ADMIT THAT SOVEREIGN STATES HAVE AUTHORITY TO GRANT SPECIAL PRIVILEGES TO INDIVIDUALS SUCH A GRANT MUST OF NECESSITY BE ONLY TEMPORARY THAT A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE ONCE GRANTED CANNOT BE WITHDRAWN IS A CONTRADICTION OF THE ORIGINAL POWERS OF SOVEREIGNTY AND IS ABHORRENT TO THE INTELLECTUAL PERCEPTIONS AS WELL AS TO MORAL PRIN CIPLE IF A STATE IS TO GRANT PRIVILEGES TO SOME IT MUST HAVE THE POWER TO DO SO BY WITHDRAWING PRIVILEGES FROM OTHERS THE RESULT OF ANY CONTRACT THEREFORE WHICH MAKES A SPECIAL PRIV ILEGE IRREVOCABLE IS TO SUBTRACT A PORTION OF SOVEREIGNTY FROM THE STATE AND CONFER IT UPON INDIVIDUALS BUT SOVEREIGNTY IN ITS VERY NATURE IS CONTINUOUS AND INDESTRUCTIBLE IF A PART OF IT MAY BE LOST THE WHOLE MAY BE LOST BY SUCCESSIVE LOSSES OF DIF FERENT PARTS A RESULT ABSURD AND UNTHINKABLE THIS PRINCIPLE IS WELL STATED BY CHIEF JUSTICE DOE THE AGENTS AUTHORITY 42115 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER TO MAKE LAW DOES NOT ENABLE THEM TO SUSPEND THEIR OWN DUTY AND BIND THEIR PRINCIPALS BY AGREEING WITH A THIRD PARTY THAT LAW SHALL NOT BE MADE THE PROHIBITION IN THE FEDERAL CON STITUTION AGAINST IMPAIRING THE OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTS WAS NEVER INTENDED COULD NOT IN LOGIC OR REASON HAVE BEEN INTENDED TO PREVENT A STATE FROM PRESERVING ITS OWN INTEGRITY FROM RE TAINING THE POWER TO LEGISLATE AS FULLY AND COMPLETELY NEXT YEAR AS IT CAN LEGISLATE THIS YEAR FROM WITHDRAWING ANY SPECIAL PRIV ILEGE WHICH IT HAS GRANTED IF THE MERE RIGHT TO BE A CORPORATION IS A SPECIAL PRIVILEGE WHICH A PRESENT LEGISLATURE CANNOT GUARANTEE AGAINST REPEAL OR CHANGE BY A FUTURE LEGISLATURE MUCH MORE IS THIS TRUE OF THOSE IMMENSELY VALUABLE PRIVILEGES SO OFTEN GRANTED IN CORPORATE CHARTERS OR ELSEWHERE BY WHICH THE MOST IMPORTANT POWERS OF SOVEREIGNTY ARE CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN CONTRACTED AWAY TO PRIVATE PARTIES THESE POWERS VARY FROM THE MOST TRIFLING UP TO SOME OF THE VERY HIGHEST AND MOST ESSENTIAL AMONG WHICH ARE THE POWER OF MAINTAINING THE EXISTENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT BY TAX ATION AND THE POWER OF PROTECTING CITIZENS FROM THE EXTORTIONS OF MONOPOLY THE CHIEF PRECEDENTS FOR THE DECISION IN THE DARTMOUTH COL LEGE CASE WERE TWO CASES IN WHICH MARSHALL HAD DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN ONE OF THEM FLETCHER V PECK 1810 THE COURT EXTENDED THE CONTRACT CLAUSE OF THE FEDERAL CON STITUTION TO PREVENT AN ACT OF ALLEGED CONFISCATION BY THE LEGIS LATURE OF VIRGINIA THERE ARE FEW LAWYERS WHO WILL NOT ADMIT THAT THIS WAS A JUDICIAL AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION BY MEANS OF A CLEVER LEGAL FICTION THIS CASE IS GENERALLY REGARDED AS HAV ING BEEN COLLUSIVE A MERE SHAM BATTLE IN WHICH BOTH PARTIES DESIRED TO OBTAIN THE SAME DECISION THEEVIDENCES OF COLLUSION WERE SO PLAIN UPON THE FACE OF THE RECORD THAT THEY WERE RE MARKED BY JUSTICE JOHNSON IN HIS OPINION IN NEW JERSEY V WILSON 1812 MARSHALL HAD HELD THAT THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY HAD CONTRACTED AWAY FOREVER THE RIGHT TO TAX CERTAIN PRIVATE LANDS AND THAT THIS CONTRACT WAS PROTECTED BY THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION THIS CASE ALSO IS OPEN TO GRAVE SUSPICION OF COL LUSION AND PRACTICALLY NO LAWYER NOW DEFENDS THE DECISION ON ANY GROUND 422 OCT1909 CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE THE PRINCIPLE ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE DART MOUTH COLLEGE CASE HAS BEEN REFUTED AND REPUDIATED MANY TIMES BY THE FEDERAL SUPREME COURT THE CASE STILL HAS THE FORCE OF LAW WITHIN A NARROW SCOPE AND IT IS OFTEN REFERRED TO IN TERMS OF GREAT POLITENESS BUT WHEN THE COURT MUSTERS UP THE COURAGE TO OVERRULE IT FEW ARGUMENTS WILL BE NEEDED IN ADDITION TO ITS OWN OPINIONS CERTAIN OF THE STATE SUPREME COURTS NOTABLY THAT OF OHIO LONG AND PERSISTENTLY STOOD OUT AGAINST A RECOGNI TION OF THE DOCTRINE OF THIS CASE BEFORE MARSHALLS DEATH IN 1835 HE AND STORY WERE SHARPLY OVERRULED BY A MAJORITY OF THE COURT IN OGDEN V SAUNDERS IN WHICH IT WAS DECIDED THAT THE PROHIBITION AGAINST LAWS IMPAIR ING THE OBLIGATION OF CONTRACTS DOES NOT APPLY TO CONTRACTS MADE SUBSEQUENT TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE LAW IN QUESTION MR COTTON REFERRING TO MARSHALLS DISSENTING OPINION IN THIS CASE SAYS IT IS HARD TO SEE THAT IT IS ANYTHING MORE THAN INGENIOUS AND FAN TASTIC IN THE CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE CASE 1837 THE COURT UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF CHIEF JUSTICE TANEY DECIDED THAT THOUGH LEGISLATIVE CONTRACTS MAY BE PROTECTED BY THE CONSTITUTION SUCH ALLEGED CONTRACTS MUST BE CONSTRUED ACCORDING TO A RULE DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO THE RULE APPLICABLE TO PRIVATE CONTRACTS IN OTHER WORDS GRANTS OF PRIVILEGES BY THE STATE ARE TO BE CONSTRUED STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE GRANTING PARTY WHILE PRIVATE GRANTS ARE CONSTRUED STRONGLY IN FAVOR OF THE GRANTEE THIS DOCTRINE THAT NOTHING CAN BE TAKEN FROM THE STATE UNLESS IT IS EXPRESSLY GRANTED LED THE COURT TO HOLD THAT NO EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE HAD BEEN GRANTED TO THE BRIDGE COMPANY JUSTICE STORY DISSENTED EARNESTLY AND LOGICALLY IF THE DOCTRINE OF THE COLLEGE CASE WAS SOUND IN WEST RIVER BRIDGE COMPANY V DIX 1848 IT WAS SETTLED THAT A STATE MAY BY THE POWER OF EMINENT DOMAIN TAKE BACK ANY PROPERTY OR PRIVILEGES WHICH IT HAS BARGAINED AWAY IN A COR PORATE CHARTER OR OTHERWISE MAKING COMPENSATION FOR THE VALUE OF WHAT IT TAKES THIS DOCTRINE IS DIRECTLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE COLLEGE CASE DECISION AS JUSTICE MCLEAN FORCIBLY POINTED OUT IN HIS OPINION IN THE CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE CASE A VIOLATION OF CONTRACT DOES NOT BECOME LESS A VIOLATION BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT THE PROTESTING PRIVILEGEHOLDER IS GIVEN MONEY ON BEING DE PRIVED OF WHAT HE CONTRACTED FOR 42315 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER IN THE GRANGER CASES 1876 IT WAS DECIDED THAT THOUGH A RAILWAY CORPORATION IS AUTHORIZED BY ITS CHARTER TO MAKE REASON ABLE CHARGES THE STATE MAY BY LAW SAY WHAT CHARGES ARE REASON ABLE AND THAT WHEN PROPERTY CORPORATE OR OTHERWISE IS DEVOTED TO A USE WHICH AFFECTS THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE SUCH AS TRANS PORTATION OR STORING GRAIN THE CONDUCT OF THE ENTERPRISE AND THE CHARGES TO BE PAID BY THE PUBLIC ARE MATTERS FOR LEGISLATIVE REGULATION THE SACREDNESS OF CORPORATE CHARTERS WAS QUIETLY IGNORED BY REJECTING THE LOGIC OF THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DE CISION CHIEF JUSTICE WAITE MADE IT POSSIBLE TO CONTROL PUBLIC UTILITY MONOPOLIES SUCH AS TRANSPORTATION TELEGRAPHS TELEPHONES ELECTRIC AND GAS LIGHTING ETC IN CASES WHERE THE CHARTER DOES NOT DEFINITELY FIX THE RATES THAT MAY BE CHARGED IN REPEATED DECISIONS THE SUPREME COURT HAS HELD THAT THE PO LICE POWER OF THE STATE IS HELD IN TRUST BY THE LEGISLATURE AND CANNOT BE CONTRACTED AWAY EVEN BY THE MOST SOLEMN AND FORMAL AGREEMENT EVER PUT IN A CORPORATE CHARTER THE POLICE POWER EXTENDS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE LIVES HEALTH AND PROPERTY OF THE CITIZENS AND TO THE PRESERVATION OF GOOD ORDER AND THE PUB LIC MORALS UNDER THIS DOCTRINE THE LEGISLATURE MAY PROHIBIT LOTTERIES THE MANUFACTURE AND SALE OF LIQUOR THE CARRYING ON OF NOXIOUS TRADES IN POPULOUS CENTERS ETC IN SPITE OF CHARTERS WHICH EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZE THE DOING OF THE THINGS PROHIBITED YET JUS TICE STRONG SPOKE TRULY WHEN IN HIS DISSENTING OPINION IN THE CASE OF THE NORTHWESTERN FERTILIZING COMPANY HE SAID THE POLICE POWER OF THE STATE IS NO MORE SACRED THAN ITS TAXING POWER HE MIGHT SAFELY HAVE SAID THAN ANY OTHER LEGISLATIVE POWER THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT OVERRULED THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE CASE IN PRINCIPLE THOUGH NOT IN NAME MARSHALLS DOCTRINE THAT THE TAXING POWER CAN BE BATTERED AWAY BY SPECIAL CONTRACTS OR PRIVATE PARTIES WITH THE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT ESCAPED VIOLENT ASSAULT IN THE SUPREME COURT THOUGH ITS UNDOING HAS BEEN THUS FAR DELAYED BY THE FACT THAT IT RESTS ON A DEFINITE PRECEDENT WHICH CANNOT BE DODGED BUT MUST BE FOL LOWED OR OVERRULED IN STATE BANK OF OHIO V KNOPP 1853 JUSTICE CATRON DISSENTING SAID THE SOVEREIGN POLITICAL POWER IS NOT THE SUBJECT OF CONTRACT SO AS TO BE VESTED IN AN IRREPEAL ABLE CHARTER OF INCORPORATION AND TAKEN AWAY FROM AND PLACED OCT 4241909 CONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE BEYOND THE REACH OF FUTURE LEGISLATURES  THE TAXING POWER IS A POLITICAL POWER OF THE HIGHEST CLASS AND EACH SUC CEEDING LEGISLATURE HAVING VESTED IN IT UNIMPAIRED ALL THE PO LITICAL POWERS PREVIOUS LEGISLATURES HAD IS AUTHORIZED TO IMPOSE TAXES ON ALL PROPERTY IN THE STATE THAT ITS CONSTITUTION DOES NOT EXEMPT IN WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY V ROUSE 1869 CHIEF JUSTICE CHASE AND JUSTICES MILLER AND FIELD DISSENTING SAID THROUGH JUSTICE MILLER THAT TO HOLD THAT A LEGISLATURE CAN BY CONTRACT DEPRIVE THE STATE FOREVER OF THE POWER OF TAXATION IS TO HOLD THAT THEY CAN DESTROY THE GOVERNMENT WHICH THEY ARE APPOINTED TO SERVE IN THE WORDS OF JUSTICE MILLER THE DOC TRINE OF IRREPEALABLE TAX EXEMPTIONS MUST FINALLY BE ABANDONED BUT NO MORE CERTAINLY THAN THE ENTIRE DOCTRINE OF IRREPEALABLE SPE CIAL PRIVILEGES TO INDIVIDUALS OR CORPORATIONS MUST BE ABANDONED IN THE CHICAGO LAKE FRONT CASE 1892 IT APPEARED THAT IN 1869 THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED TO THE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD COMPANY A TRACT OF MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND ACRES UNDER LAKE MICHIGAN THE PRINCIPAL PART OF CHICAGOS HARBOR EXTENDING A MILE INTO THE LAKE THE GRANT HAVING BEEN REPEALED IN 1873 THIS SUIT WAS BROUGHT TO SEE IF THE REPEALING LAW WAS VOID AS IM PAIRING THE OBLIGATION OF THE ORIGINAL GRANT IT WAS DECIDED FOUR AGAINST THREE THAT THE REPEALING LAW WAS VALID ON THE GROUND THAT THE LEGISLATURE HELD THE TITLE TO SUBMERGED LAND UNDER NAVI GABLE WATERS IN TRUST FOR THE PEOPLE AND COULD NOT ALIENATE IT EXCEPT IN SUCH SMALL PARCELS OR IN SUCH REASONABLE AND LIMITED WAYS AS MIGHT SERVE THE PUBLIC PURPOSES OF NAVIGATION COM MERCE ETC JUSTICE FIELD GIVING THE OPINION OF THE COURT SAID THE POWER TO RESUME THE TRUST WHENEVER THE STATE JUDGES BEST IS WE THINK INCONTROVERTIBLE THE POSITION ADVANCED BY THE RAILROAD COMPANY    WOULD PLACE EVERY HARBOR IN THE COUNTRY AT THE MERCY OF A MAJORITY OF THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE TRUE AS THIS IS IT IS NO LESS TRUE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOLDS IN TRUST FOR THE PEOPLE OTHER PUBLIC PROPERTY AND PRIVILEGES AND THAT THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DECISION IN UTTER DISREGARD OF THIS PRINCIPLE HAS PLACED FOR EXAMPLE THE STREETS OF EVERY CITY AT THE MERCY OF A MAJORITY OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE OR OF THE MUNICIPAL BODY TO WHICH LEGISLATIVE POWER HAS BEEN DELEGATED BY ACTS PASSED IN 1856 AND 1865 THE MINNESOTA LEGISLATURE 42515 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER INCORPORATED A RAILROAD WHICH LATER BECAME THE GREAT NORTHERN AND GAVE IT ALMOST UNLIMITED AUTHORITY TO CONSOLIDATE WITH OTHER RAILROADS BUT IT WAS PROVIDED THAT THE CHARTER COULD BE AMENDED IN ANY MANNER NOT DESTROYING OR IMPAIRING VESTED RIGHTS IN 1874 A LAW WAS PASSED PROHIBITING THE CONSOLIDATION OF PARALLEL AND COMPETING RAILROADS IN 1895 THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT COURT IN MINNESOTA WAS CALLED ON TO DECIDE WHETHER THE ACT OF 1874 IM PAIRECD THE CONTRACT CONTAINED IN THE CHARTER THE GREAT NORTHERN HAVING ATTEMPTED AFTER 1874 A CONSOLIDATION DID NOT BECOME VESTED UNTIL IT WAS EXERCISED AND THEREFORE THE ACT DID NOT DESTROY OR IMPAIR ANY VESTED RIGHT THE CIRCUIT JUDGE HELD THAT THERE IS NO DISTINCTION IN REASON OR IN THE AUTHORITIES BETWEEN THE RIGHT TO A FRANCHISE THAT HAS BEEN AND THE RIGHT TO ONE THAT HAS NOT BEEN USED UNLESS THERE HAS BEEN A FORFEITURE FOR NONUSER AND THAT THE FRANCHISE TO CONSOLIDATE WITH ANOTHER RAILROAD CORPORATION WAS A VESTED RIGHT OF THIS DEFENDANT FROM THE TIME OF THE ACCEPTANCE OF ITS GRANT THE CIRCUIT JUDGE WAS RIGHTIF THERE IS ANY VIRTUE IN THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DECISION BUT THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ONLY TWO DISSENTING DECIDED THAT HE WAS WRONG THAT THE RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE DID NOT BECOME VESTED UNTIL USED THAT THEY DID NOT DO THE LOGICAL THING AND OVERRULE THE COLLEGE CASE DECISION IS TO BE REGRETTED BUT THAT THEY REFUSED TO APPLY IT EVEN THOUGH USING A DISTINCTION THAT DOES NOT DISTINGUISH IS CAUSE FOR SATISFACTION AND HOPE JUSTICE BROWN GIVING THE OPINION OF THE COURT SAID WE THINK IT WAS COMPETENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE OUT OF DUE REGARD FOR THE PUBLIC WELFARE TO DECLARE THAT ITS CHARTER SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF STIFLING COMPETITION AND BUILDING UP MONOPOLIES IN SHORT WE CANNOT RECOGNIZE A VESTED RIGHT TO DO A MANIFEST WRONG THESE ARE BRAVE AND JUST WORDS WHEN COURAGEOUSLY AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED TO THE WHOLE FIELD OF CONSTITUTIONAL LAW THEY WILL DESTROY THE LAST VESTIGE OF THE DOCTRINE RESTING ON THE DARTMOUTH COLLEGE DECISION AND WILL RESTORE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATES THAT COM PLETE AND CONTINUOUS CONTROL OF LEGISLATION WHICH THE CONSTITU TION GAVE THEM IN HIS DISSENTING OPINION IN THE CHARLES RIVER BRIDGE CASE JUSTICE STORY EXPRESSED THE OPINION THAT AN EXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE TO 426 OCTCONFUSION OF PROPERTY WITH PRIVILEGE BUILD AND MAINTAIN A BRIDGE ACROSS A RIVER BETWEEN TWO CITIES DID NOT CONSTITUTE A MONOPOLY HIS DEFINITION OF MONOPOLY WAS AN EXCLUSIVE RIGHT GRANTED TO A FEW OF SOMETHING WHICH WAS BEFORE A COMMON RIGHT SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE AN EXCLUSIVE RIGHT TO NAVIGATE A RIVER BECAUSE SPECIAL LEGISLATIVE AUTHORITY WAS NECESSARY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD BUILD A BRIDGE AN EX CLUSIVE FRANCHISE TO BUILD ONE WOULD NOT DEPRIVE ANY CITIZEN OF AN ALREADY EXISTING RIGHT BY THE SAME TEST AN EXCLUSIVE FRAN CHISE TO RUN A STREET RAILWAY OR LAY GAS PIPES OR STRING ELECTRIC WIRES WOULD NOT ESTABLISH A MONOPOLY FROM JUDGES SO UTTERLY INCAPABLE OF ECONOMIC REASONING OR OF TAKING A LONG LOOK AHEAD WE SHOULD NOT EXPECT VERY GOOD LAW ON ECONOMIC SUBJECTS WE SHOULD NOT JUDGE THEM TOO HARSHLY FOR THEY WERE TRAINED AND LIVED IN A DIFFERENT AGE BTIT THAT WE SHOULD ALLOW THEIR MISTAKES OF FACT THEIR LEGAL MISCONCEPTIONS THEIR ECONOMIC OBTUSENESS THEIR PARTISAN PASSIONS AND PREJUDICES TO REACH DOWN THROUGH THE DEC ADES AND MAKE LAW FOR US IN REGARD TO SOME OF OUR MOST VITAL INTERESTSTHIS IS HARD TO EXPLAIN ON THE THEORY THAT WE ARE AN INTELLIGENT SELFGOVERNING PEOPLE THE INDEPENDENT 1909 427

j100335,The Quarterly Journal of Economics,1882318,An International Survey of the Cotton Industry,i305256,AN INTERNATIONAL SURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY AMONG the larger industrial changes of the last thirty years few exceed in importance and interest the marvellous growth of the manufacture of cotton by machinery Not only in its original seats but also in regions where its introduction came much later the industry has expanded wonderfully The progress in the several countries has however been far from uniform in regard either to its magnitude or to the description and quality of the fabrics produced Nor are the circum stances under which it has been realized at all alike nor of similar significance when they are brought to bear upon the problem of the present and future international position Each case must be separately examined and we must deter mine the precise causes of the progress and whether these have exhausted their force or are likely to continue or to be aided or checked by new influences But a preliminary question arises The establishment on a large scale in recent years of cotton mills near to the source of the principal raw material in the American Southern States and in India and its commencement in China and Egypt have encouraged the assumption that the industry must tend to gravitate more and more to the cotton field Thus in his address delivered on 22d October last as Rector of the University of St Andrews Mr Carnegie said  Capital man agement and skilled labor have become mobile in the ex treme The seat of manufacturing is now and will continue to be more and more simply a question where the requisite raw materials are found under suitable conditions Capital and skilled labor have lost the power they once had to attract raw materials these now attract labor and capital The con ditions are reversed The cotton industry for instance was attracted from Old to New England and is now attracted from it to the Southern States alongside the raw material There is much no doubt in a merely extrinsic view of Southern and Indian progress to give a certain strong appear418 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS ance of probability to the theory laid down by Mr Carnegie The facts are before our eyes Capital and skilled labor have been applied on a vast scale to manufacture at the sources of the raw material But many other things have to be consid ered before we can conclude that this new phenomenon is to be attributed to the greater mobility in recent years of capital and labor Raw material too has become much more mobile If the cost of transporting raw cotton to the older seats of manufacture were alone to be taken into account it would appear that there is today far more reason for the supremacy of the industry in districts remote from the cotton fields than there was half a century ago The cost of transport and mar keting has been reduced to less than oneeighth of what it was then To this extent at least the raw material has become very much more mobile but this is not the only consideration and other factors entering into the problem will receive atten tion presently It is commonly supposed that in the earlier years of the mechanical spinning and weaving of cotton Great Britain had for a long time the start before other nations This belief is not strictly accurate Machinery was used in both branches almost if not quite as soon in the United States as in Eng land From priority of establishment therefore the English industry gained little Indeed during the Napoleonic wars at the end of the eighteenth and in the earlier part of the nineteenth century when cotton spinning by steam and water power began to be important the advantage was with the Americans since they were then and for a long time after wards free from the heavy customs duties on raw cotton and most of the other materials of production coal of course excepted besides the excise duty on printed cotton goods which oppressed the spinners and manufacturers of the United Kingdom Moreover the brief war of 181215 between the States and the old country gave a strong impetus to the American industry The prices of cotton goods on the western side of the Atlantic rose to four times their previous amount and cottonspinning mills there were multiplied so excessively that after the restoration of peace in 1815 many of them were closed and became for a time almost worthless In the folSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 419 lowing year protective duties were imposed mainly by the influence of the Southern representatives in Congress for the purpose of reviving and encouraging home manufactures the cotton industry of the North being mostly opposed to them Before 1813 steam and water power had been applied only to the spinning branch in both countries but in that year the first mechanical looms were erected in the United States Comparatively few were then in existence in Europe and in 1816 there were but 2000 power looms in Lancashire In Switzerland France Germany and even in Austria Italy and Belgium also the factory system of spinning was developed almost as early as in Great Britain but weaving by power looms was hardly established in the Continental coun tries on an important scale by 1830 except in a few particular districts such as Alsace the Vosges Rouen Elberfeldt and two or three Swiss cantons This tardier development of mechanical weaving on the Continent continued long after 1830 and it has had important consequences as we shall presently see Bearing in mind the fact that regarded as a completely mechanical industry cotton spinning and weaving had not become thoroughly rooted in Great Britain until towards the close of the first quarter of the last century one is drawn to the conclusion that at that period it had not gained an appreciable priority in time of its American rival Its position in 1831 35 in relation to the cotton industries of the Continent and the United States is approximately indicated by a few figures In those five years the average annual consumption of cotton was Milhons of Lbs Per Cent United Kingdom             2952 100 Continent of Europe

written in 1836 in the Introduc tion of Dr Ures Cotton manufacture of Great Britain   The encroachment of foreign competition upon the cotton trade of the United Kingdom has become so rapid of late as420 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS to excite alarm for its supremacy under our heavy taxation in any mind not besotted by national pride The continent of Europe and the United States of America for some time after the peace of 1815 possessed factories upon so small a scale that they could not be regarded as our rivals in the business of the world But now they work up nearly 750000 bales of cotton wool which is about threefourths of our consumption and have become formidable competitors to us in many markets exclusively our own This was written in 1836 Another instance of alarm at the supposed relative decline of the English cotton industry occurred in that year when the Board of Trade the official Department of Commerce forwarded to the Manchester Chamber of Commerce a number of samples of various descrip tions of cotton piece goods including prints produced in Germany and Switzerland These were examined by a com mittee of which Richard Cobden then a director of the Chamber was a leading member The report shows that he and his colleagues were deeply impressed by the excellence and cheapness of these productions and there is conclusive evidence in a memorial to Parliament which he drafted two years later upon British Customs and Excise Policy at that time that he had begun almost to despair of the English cotton industry as a competitor with the corresponding indus tries of the Continent unless the oppressive fiscal burdens then laid upon it were removed But even since the advent of Free Trade fears of approaching decline have on a few occa sions been expressed more or less loudly What is the relative position of the industry in the United Kingdom the Continent and the United States today measured by the quantity of raw cotton consumed in each In the last cotton season  the year ended on September 30 1902  the consumption in these three great divisions was  Millions of Lbs Per Cent United Kingdom               16265 100 Continent of Europe

the Continent following second and the United States third as before though much more closely in both cases The apparent paradox that whilst still possessing very much more spinning machinery than the Continent or the United States Great Britain spins very much less cotton than either of them is easily explained The yarn produced in English mills is by many degrees finer and of higher value than that spun in the mills of the other two regions English cotton yarn has long been growing finer and finer This change has been brought about by two or three causes but mainly it is a consequence of the increase of machinery in countries to which the coarser British yarns and piece goods were formerly sent Another cause is that the progress of mankind in wealth and refinement has encouraged the demand for superior more varied and more tasteful cotton fabrics requiring for their production finer yarns For the spinning of these and in a great degree for the weaving of the superior fabrics the climate and the training and skill of the managers and workpeople as well as the indus trial and commercial organization of the English cotton trade have proved themselves admirably adapted The rapid progress of cotton spinning on the Continent dur ing the last fifty years is to be accounted for in part by the great industrial and commercial awakening which followed the settlement of the FrancoGerman conflict The new spirit was of course most powerful and most effective in Germany But it pervaded the rest of the nations and one of its fruits was a larger demand for labor a rise of wages and a great up lifting of the material condition of the people To this were422 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS added increase of population and vast improvements in the means of transport aided by the important easing of the cus toms tariff restrictions which before 1860 had impeded in ternational commercial intercourse between the European countries It is true that after the FrancoGerman War a powerful Protectionist reaction set in which became still stronger in 1878 when Prince Bismarck gave it the counte nance of his powerful authority Thirteen years later how ever a more liberal commercial policy supervened which under the impulse of German initiation and guidance resulted in the series of European treaties of 1891 On the whole not withstanding some serious backsliding the customs arrange ments of the European States during the last forty years have not entirely lost the impress of the AngloFrench treaty of 1860 negotiated by Richard Cobden When contrasted with the highly restrictive and in some respects prohibitory system previously existing the regime which has since prevailed has reactions notwithstanding been exceedingly favorable to inter national commerce in Europe All these considerations bear with special force upon the question of the great progress of the Continental cotton indus try because its productions are almost entirely consumed within the boundaries of Europe Of a very few special kinds of cotton goods moderate quantities are sent to other parts of the world but in relation to the whole they are of trifling account Regarded in its entirety the Continental cotton in dustry must be considered a hometrade industry and its great expansion within the last halfcentury must be attrib uted mainly to the enlargement of the home market But there is another contributory cause which is of great significance in estimating the present position and the pros pects of the Continental cotton industry Before 1870 the process of substituting powerloom weaving for the handloom method had made relatively very moderate progress in Europe outside the United Kingdom In the latter the cotton hand loom had quite disappeared and in the United States it sur vived as a remnant only in the mountains of Kentucky and Tennessee and in isolated spots in the Southern States But among the Continental nations the handicraft weaving of cotSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 423 ton was widely prevalent not only as a domestic but also as a semifactory system Within the last thirty years it has been steadily giving way to the power loom yet it is even now very far from being extinguished In Russia the number of hand looms weaving cotton goods is still enormous in Austria there are 40000 of them and in Germany France Italy Spain and the Balkan countries many thousands are at work Now the effect of the substitution of the mechanical for the hand loom since 1870 on the Continent has been the same as that of the like change in Great Britain which was completed before that year It reduced greatly the prices of woven goods and their cheapness together with the other economic developments already referred to stimulated the demand for them enor mously and the satisfaction of this enlarged requirement involved the necessity of a much greater supply of yarn Hence the very rapid addition to the number of spindles and the consumption of raw cotton Before the FrancoGerman War of 187072 the quantity used by the Continental mills had never reached 800000000 pounds Since then the progress has been almost continuous at all events until the season 189899 when it was suddenly arrested The successive upward steps and the movement since 189899 are sufficiently indicated by the annexed table CONTINENTAL CONSUMPTION OF COTTON Seasons Lbs

at the rate of 88400000 pounds per annum and last season the increase was 104000000 pounds Thus the highest level was reached three years ago In considering these figures it is424 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS interesting to note that English textile engineers who have supplied the bulk of the spinning machinery for the Continen tal mills have received exceedingly few orders since 1899 and those chiefly from France for the equipment of new spinning establishments in foreign Europe It is further to be observed that at the end of last season the stocks of yarn held in nearly every spinningdistrict of the Continent were very heavy a fact which proves that the enlarged consumption of 190102 was excessive Even the foregoing remarkable figures do not tell the whole story of the extraordinary growth in the consumption of cotton fabrics in Continental Europe during the last thirty years So great was the pressure of the demand for yarn to supply the steadily increasing number of power looms that much larger quantities of it were imported from England For the following figures I am indebted to Mr Thomas Ellison of Liverpool  EXPORTS OF BRITISH COTTON YARN TO EUROPE EUROPEAN

since 1872 They afford of course no means of discovering how much of the increase is to be attributed to each of the several stimulat ing influences previously mentioned The halt which occurred after 189899 excites inquiry as to its causes In part no doubt it is explained by the German and Russian financialSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 425 troubles and the consequent depression of trade throughout the greater portion of the Continent during the last two years I am inclined to think however that the arrest of the progress three years ago is largely due to the diminished force of the special stimulus springing from the substitution of power for hand looms If this be a correct opinion it warrants the ex pectation that in the absence of any new impulse the increase of cotton spinning on the European Continent will be very much slower in future than it has been during the last thirty years But a further question confronts us May not the check to the increase in the weight of cotton and yarn consumed be due very much to the same cause as that to which the same feature in the British consumption is to be ascribed namely the spinning and weaving of finer counts of yarn Un doubtedly more fine yarn is being spun in Germany and France at least than in 1880 but in spite of the customs tariffs of these countries in respect of cotton yarn being especially designed to encourage the production of the finer numbers climatic and other difficulties have so far prevented any ex tension of this branch of the industry at all comparable to that which has been accomplished in the spinning of the lower and medium counts It is certainly true that the average fineness of the yarn shipped from England to the Continent is very much higher than it was twentyfive years ago Indeed it is a common expression amongst Manchester merchants engaged in this trade  The Continental demand for low counts is gone Within the last two years the erection of new cotton spin ning machinery on the Continent has greatly diminished During 1902 the total number of spindles remained unaltered or was but slightly augmented in every country except France and even there the increase was only about 200000 In part no doubt and perhaps greatly the arrest of progress thus indicated must be traced to the German financial crisis of 1900 and the consequent depression of trade there and in surrounding States as well as to the contemporaneous finan cial and industrial troubles in Russia But since the rapid expansion of spinning capacity between the years 1880 and 1900 was undoubtedly due very much to the substitution of426 Q UAR TERL Y JO URNAL OF ECONOMICS power looms for hand looms it is a reasonable inference that even after the effects of the financial disturbances have passed away the rate of progress will diminish Assuming that the force of this special and incidental impetus to the Continental cottonspinning industry is now becoming spent a further question arises Is it not probable that the production of the spindles and looms of some at least if not all of the Continental nations will begin to compete seriously in the extraEuropean markets All that can be said on this subject at present is that there is no obvious reason why it should do so apart from some kind of State aid or the pressure of temporarily overstocked home markets To one or other of these adventitious forms of assistance the export of an appreciable proportion of the Continental cotton goods now finding their way into neutral markets must be ascribed This fact is of itself highly significant for it shows that although there are a few special descriptions which can be exported in open competition and under natural conditions to such markets the prevailing circumstances are not at all extensively favorable to the creation of an important export of cotton manufactures from the European countries in com petition with England not to speak of the United States to which attention must now be directed Writing upon the United States cotton industry mainly for American readers I am conscious of approaching the subject with some diffidence Yet having gathered much information about this and other American economic questions by long observation by strong sympathy with the American people and by conversation and correspondence with wellinformed citizens I hope I may be found reasonably free from important error The chief interest of the progress of the American cotton mill industry in recent years lies in its amazingly rapid growth in the Southern States Before the Civil War of 186164 there were very few mills in that section of the country For wellknown social and economic reasons organized manufacture could not flourish in the midst of slavery Yet in the year 184748 their consumption of cotton was 75000 bales against 532000 bales in the North and in 186061 it was 193000SURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 427 bales against 650000 bales Now comes a remarkable fact In the latter year just before the war broke out onehalf of the population of the Southern States that is to say about 5000000 people were clothed in handwoven cotton goods In 1870 five years after the war not less than 3500000 were thus clothed These are the estimates of my friend Mr Ed ward Atkinson of Boston than whom I believe there is no higher authorityfounded upon extensive correspondence and conversation with many old planters merchants and other wellinformed persons in the South and confirmed by his own abundant knowledge In 1880 there was still a considerable remnant of this domestic manufacture in the mountains of Kentucky and North Carolina where it had long been exten sively carried on It was the last survival of a handicraft industry once prevailing throughout the States and from that region the labor force of the Southern cottonmills was drawn for many years after the war The people all whites having acquired the deftness necessary in the handling of threads supplied a suitable class of operatives for the mills These however did not increase very rapidly until 1879 Since then their progress presents one of the most remarkable incidents in the history of the worlds cotton trade during the last twenty years This marvellous development may be traced to a concur rence of forces Until 1875 the spinning mills were largely engaged in producing yarn partly for the hand looms of the South then gradually disappearing and partly for the power looms which were superseding them and were requiring more and more liberal supplies According to the census of 187980 there were 12360 power looms in the Southern mills But in 190001 the number was 122902 and it is considerably greater now Within the same interval of twentytwo years the num ber of spindles in the South increased from 561360 to 5819 835 The rate of expansion was thus almost equal in the two departments But the substitution of machine for handloom goods was probably all but completed between 1885 and 1890 This operation brought with it as a consequence just as it did in Europe reduced prices of cloth and an enlarged consump tion which was further promoted by the great growth of428 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONO1MICS population owing partly to natural increase and partly to im migration from the North But within the last fifteen or twenty years another and a very important new field of dis tribution for Southern cotton goods has been opened out in Eastern Asia and elsewhere abroad Still further the cloths made in the South which are of coarse texture have competed increasingly in recent years with the production of the New England manufacturers compelling them to devote their at tention more and more to the finer and more highly finished descriptions which are not yet made in the South The deliberate opinion of Lancashire manufacturers who within the last twelve months have visited the United States for the purpose of investigating the cotton industry is that they have nothing to fear from the competition of the North In the South however one item in the cost of production that of labor threatens they think rather seriously not only their own the Lancashire position but also that of the manufacturers of the Northern States The rates of wages in relation to the quantity produced are not more comparing the same classes of goods than from onethird to onefourth of those prevailing in Lancashire and in New England which are approximately the same although often the North Ameri can piecerates of wages are slightly lower than the English How is it that in one part of the same country a sufficient supply of labor can be obtained at piecework rates so greatly below those paid in another part The answer is highly in teresting Some of the workers have come as already stated from the mountain districts of Kentucky and North Carolina where they formerly made a scanty living by handloom weav ing eked out perhaps by the cultivation of the soil on a small scale Others are drawn from the families of poor farmers who have settled in the South since the war In both cases the remuneration offered in the mills was so much better than their previous scanty earnings as to induce them to adopt the more remunerative calling There is good reason to believe however that this disparity of labor cost cannot be very long maintained The scarcity of adult workpeople has become so urgent that the working force of many mills consists to an astonishing extent of little children of eight to ten years oldSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 429 Immature labor of this kind cannot be very long continued Nor is it likely that rates of wages so greatly below those pre vailing in the North can remain unaltered for any considerable time I am told moreover by visitors to the States who have returned to England within the last month that the cotton manufacturers of the Northern States entertain no serious apprehensions with regard to the permanence or at any rate the increase of Southern competition But there is apparently another contributory cause of the extraordinary spread of cottonmills in the South Far more extensively than in the North the employment of the new automatic loom prevails there Calling for less labor at tention and skill on the part of the operative the American type is very well suited to the kind of weaving characteristic of the South These machines employed upon such work go far towards justifying their descriptive name and a single weaver is able to look after three times as many of them as of the ordinary loom Hence the labor cost of each piece of cloth is enormously reduced Upon one important difference between American and Eng lish methods of weaving some discussion is just now going on in Lancashire In this country cotton looms are run at a speed averaging from 15 to 20 per cent higher than in the United States yielding therefore a larger production at the expense however of greater strain upon the yarn more frequent break ages of threads and stoppages of the machine The question is whether or not it would be better to reduce the speed so as to enable the weaver to take care of more looms The less ened product per loom would of course involve increased cost of production for fixed charges but this might be more than compensated by lowering the piecerate of wages without any loss of earnings to the weaver who would increase his individ ual output by being able to tend a larger number of looms without additional exertion The main interest of the subject of American competition with British cotton manufactures centres in foreign and colon ial markets There can be no doubt that to some of them certain descriptions of American goods are going in increased quantity We know moreover that in one market that of430 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS China sheetings drills and jeans from the United States have within the last ten years taken a larger place than British makes of these classes One cause of this change has recently been practically re moved the very much higher freights charged for the car riage of goods to Shanghai from British ports than from New  Editors Note The following figures are

cost of production in the American Southern States It is the pro duction of these very classes of manufactures so extensively produced there which has gone to swell greatly in recent years the exports from America to China The cure for this partic ular inequality is simply a matter of time for it can only come about by the play of economic forces which though slow are sure Before attempting to summarize salient points in the British position it is desirable to refer to the machine cotton industry of the East of India Japan and China where the conditions are widely different from those of the European and American industries The manufacture of cotton began in Asia whence it was brought to Europe in its handicraft state Within the last halfcentury Europe has given it back to Asia as a machine industry The first Asiatic cottonmill was established in the island of Bombay in 1851 It contained 26000 spindles and no looms In 1871 the number of spindles in all India was about 430000 and there were 5575 power looms Twenty years later in 1891 the number of spindles had reached 3250000 and of looms 23000 and now there are about 5000000 spindles and 41000 looms In the United Kingdom the number of cotton spindles is approximately 47000000 and of looms 750000 that is to say one loom for every 626 spindles In India the proportion is one loom to 122 spindles The difference is significant because it shows that machine spinning has made much more rapid progress in India than machine weaving The old spinningwheel has not quite dis appeared but it is very nearly extinguished and yet there are countless numbers of wooden hand looms still at work in nearly all parts of the country resisting alike the competition of the coarse productions of the native mills and of the finer goods imported from England The records of the Indian govern ment may be searched in vain for definite statistics of the handicraft weaving industry but the census returns of the occupations of the people and the famine reports supply infor mation enough to show that handloom weaving is still carried on to a vast extent in every province In a statement issued by the India Office in 1885 it was estimated that not less than432 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 84 per cent of the 1011815 pounds of raw cotton grown in the Punjab was spun and woven there in the homes of the people But undoubtedly the Indian mills were for many years after their inception engaged mainly in displacing the old indigenous handicraft industry and the process is still going on though now very slowly But within the last twentyfive years the product of the Indian spinning mills has found a very large outlet in other parts of Asia especially in China In the year ended March 31 1880 the total export of Indian yarn was 25862474 lbs of which 22567297 lbs went to China In 18991900 the total amount was 240693027 lbs of which the proportion taken by China was 231570757 lbs Within twenty years the outside demand for Indian cotton yarn was multiplied more than 91 times and the China demand more than 11 times The political disturbances in the Far Eastern Empire have so greatly interrupted its foreign trade during the last two years that the statistics of this trade since 1890 are not instructive for the present purpose It is quite clear however that the Indian cottonspinning industry owes its remarkable progress quite as much to say the least and probably more to the great opening for its product in China than to the enlargement of the market in India The yarn was wanted there of course because it was very much cheaper and better than the old handspun yarn made from Chinese cotton which is weak and short in staple and can be spun by hand only at great cost India has never sent to Japan any considerable quantity of yarn In 187980 the amount was 1814090 lbs and in 18991900 only 180000 lbs But in Japan a very extensive cottonspinning industry has arisen which is also largely en gaged in supplying the China market The number of spin dles in the Japanese mills is now about 1250000 onefourth of the capacity of the Indian establishments and Japanese com petition has arisen in spite of the fact that the greater part of the raw material which they use is imported from India itself To a large extent Japanese yarn is used to supply the native hand looms of Japan for there are few power looms yet in Japan but much of it is sent to China where it is welcomedSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 433 as a rival to the Indian product But in China itself an attempt has been made within the last eight years to estab lish a cottonspinning mill industry mainly by Europeans who argued that if India and Japan could find so large a market for their yarn in China there must be room for a spinning industry there The result of this new departure has not been at all encouraging Chinese cotton is of poor quality and it is by no means certain that even if it could be improved native labor would be found anything like so efficient as is that of India or Japan The total capacity of the cottonmills of China is probably not more than 700000 spindles and the capital invested in them has on the whole proved so unprofit ably employed that no extension is now going on and none is contemplated Reverting to the Indian cotton industry it must be observed that the consequences of its creation have been very important from an international point of view One of its earliest results was to substitute machinemade yarn and cloth for the handi craft product within the country itself In this respect it followed precisely the course observable in all countries where cottonmills have taken root But it would be a great mistake to suppose that the ancient domestic cotton weaving of India or even the employment of the hand spinningwheel has disappeared On the contrary there is abundant evidence as already stated that handloom weaving is still carried on very extensively indeed in certain provinces The next result was the supply on a very extensive scale to other parts of Asia and particularly to China of cheap and good Indian yarn for the consumption of the native hand looms The current in this lastnamed direction has been seriously disturbed within the last two years by political events in China and the pro prietors of the Indian mills have had to pass through very trying times Their illfortune has been greatly aggravated by deficient rainfall in India and a serious reduction in the supply of cotton For these reasons many of the Indian spin ning companies have had to face serious losses and a few of them have been forced into liquidation prominently some of the Bombay companies whose production has hitherto gone chiefly to China434 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Briefly stated the conclusions to which I have been brought by a careful study of the machine cotton industry in Asia are 1 that although wonderfully rapid during the last thirty or forty years it has not only been extensively engaged in substi tuting machine for handicraft production but also in displacing English imports of coarse yarn 2 that the progress has not gone very far at the expense of the handloom weaving branch which is still able to hold its ground very successfully not withstanding the establishment of about 43000 power looms in India and China whilst Spain one of the most backward countries in Europe industrially possesses nearly 70000 3 that there is no present prospect of either India Japan or China being able to compete successfully with the European and American cotton industry in the production of the finer yarns and the higher qualities of piece goods and 4 that the main hope of India and China in this field lies in the gradual disap pearance of handicraft manufacture in which however there are great possibilities of expansion but always within the lim its of the coarser and cheaper qualities Perhaps some excep tion to this last statement should be made in the case of Japan whence some excellent specimens of woven goods have already made their way into the markets of the Far East In Japan however the power loom has as yet made very little progress most of the piece goods produced there being made in hand looms There remains the question how far the extraordinarily rapid development of the machine cotton industry has affected and is likely to affect the demand for European and American particularly English cotton goods and yarns in Asia It is quite certain that the imports into India and also into China and Japan of the coarser counts of English yarn have greatly fallen off within the last twenty years The supply of the finer English spinnings to all these countries is however fairly well maintained and the following figures show that the im ports into India of all kinds of cotton yarn are still on the whole considerable and that the decrease within the last ten years though great has not been alarming in view of the per sistence of plague and

evident that in spite of the disastrous experience of India during the last three years and of the efforts of the Indian mills to find outlets in the Dependency itself for the surplus production enforced by the partial loss of the China market English cotton goods have not ceased to make their way in greater quantity to India where also certain kinds of American goods are used though not in large quantity436 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Occasional reference to the progress and condition of the British cotton industry has already been made at some length in the preceding portion of this survey It remains to state the writers view of it more fully in a general summary of the international position The spinning and weaving of cotton in Great Britain by modern machinery began under very adverse circumstances Prolonged and devastating war pro fuse national expenditure and all its consequences heavy taxation and other exhausting sacrifices prohibitions and fiscal barriers to international trade in other countries poverty amongst the English people and scanty capital in the hands of manufacturers were the attendants of its birth and its years of youth All these obstacles it survived although the raw material of the industry was entirely brought from distant lands In spite of all these seeming obstacles the industry rapidly rose to the foremost position The later progress of the industry in other countries has practically extinguished most of the branches of business upon which its earlier success was founded Nevertheless it has continued to increase and is still increasing Foreign competition resulting from nat ural development or from artificial protection has impeded but it has not stopped its progress and there is no evidence of its decay or decadence It has the advantage of a highly favorable climate in Lancashire a welltrained and industrious body of workpeople directed by experienced management and supported by an admirable commercial organization which embraces every market in the world Added to these favor able factors it has a fiscal system which enables it to obtain all the materials and accessories required in the industry at the lowest possible prices lower indeed on the whole than its competitors in other countries can command Its principal raw material has to be brought from sources thousands of miles away and yet this important disadvantage has been enormously lessened since it was established Free competi tion is its accustomed atmosphere and in spite of hostile foreign customs duties upon its productions it still survives and grows Whatever future changes may occur therefore to help or hinder its course there is no reason to doubt still less to despair of its future so long as it is allowed to enjoy the benefits of Free TradeSURVEY OF THE COTTON INDUSTRY 437 The obstacles to the prompt adoption of improvements in machinery and methods which arise in a few British industries from labor organizations are not likely to seriously impede their introduction into the British cotton manufacture For the most part wages are paid on a piecework basis and there is no restriction upon output other than that imposed by the Factory Acts There are of course always questions of ad justment of the piecework rates whenever new machines are brought in which increase the amount of production whilst lessening the call upon the labor or attention of the work people These are settled usually on the principle of divid ing the pecuniary advantage of the improvement between em ployer and employee At the present moment a question of this kind has arisen in connection with  automatic looms the use of which is only now becoming a practical consideration in Lancashire cottonmills The weavers tradeunions have fully recognized the necessity of adopting one or more of the various inventions connoted by the term automatic loom and they are aware that the economy resulting from their em ployment must be shared by the proprietors of the mills The proper apportionment of the advantage will no doubt give rise to serious discussion and it may be to some conflict but there is nothing in the disposition of the two sides to justify the least fear that this will impede the introduction of this or any other improvement in the processes of the industry ELIJAH HE LM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE MANCHESTEE ENGLAND

had been possible to some geologist twenty years ago how different might be the literature of our drift IMPROVEMENT OF THE NATIVE PAS TURELANDS OF THE FAR WEST IT is a wellknown fact that the greater part of the United States west of the meridian of Omaha is unfit for tillage Here and there there are strips of land which have a larger rainfall that may be brought under the plough and along the rivers there are narrow belts of land that may be made tillable by irrigation A portion of this region is utterly barren but a large part of it  probably not far from one million square miles of the whole area or an area nearly one hundred times the surface of Massachusetts bears a scanty crop of grasses The natural use of this region is already recog nized its sole worth is for the pasturage of cattle and sheep Already a great herding industry has been created in this region  one that has an important bearing on the foodsup ply of this country and of Europe The only limitation on the great extension of this industry is found in the scantiness of the herbage and the inadequacy of the watersupply The lat ter evil is probably remediable in most cases at least by wells or by storagereservoirs which shall retain the abundant waterfall of the rainy season I propose to offer some suggestions concerning the possibility of bettering the herbage of forageplants All the grasses that now grow in that region make but a scanty herbage I am informed by stockraisers that the best  ranges  require from fifteen to twenty acres to a head of horned cattle and that from this unusual goodness the  ranges decline in value until in many districts a hundred acres is required to supply a beast The wide extent of the ranges neces sary to afford pasturage to herds of profitable numbers makes the supply of water more diffi cult than it otherwise would be It seems to me possible that the pasturage of this region might be materially improved bv the introduction of grasses and other forage plants indigenous to regions having something lik3 the same conditions of climate My rea sons for hope in this matter are substantially as follows the experience of settlement in this Country shows that the grasses are more easilyferalized than any other of our do mes aicated plants several of them show a VOL I No 7 willingness to escape to the wilderness so that there is hope that a careful selection in various lands might afford some other species that would run wild on our dry plains and mountains European experiments in natural izing grasses have been fairly successful as in the case of grasses to protect dunes from the action of the wind There are many regions in the world where grasses have developed to suit just such con ditions as we have on our plains and in some of those regions the period for the process of development to go on has been far longer than in North America In North America it has been but a single geological period since the vegetation of the plains and Rocky Moun tains was well watered while in Australia it seems likely that the dryness of the climate has been in existence from a rather remote past The same is probably the case in the northern parts of Asia and in South Africa Good effects from the introduction of foreign forageplants may be hoped for if the only result were an increase in the variety of the herbage on the plains With the poorest grasses there are generally wide interspaces between the tussocks of highgrowing species If these intervals could be filled with other forageplants the consequence would be a greater amount of food to the acre In the effort to naturalize foreign species of forageplants attention should be paid to all forms of plants that can afford pasturage or browsing There are many forms that would be likely to do well along the streams that might not succeed so well in the open country The regions that are likely to furnish plants calculated to flourish in a region of low rain fall include a large part of the earths surface Those that would succeed in Dakota are not likely to do well in Texas or Arizona For the northern region the uplands of northern Asia or of Patagonia are the most promising fields of search while for the middle and southern fields the valley of the La Plata southern Africa Atustralia and the Algerian district may be looked to for suitable species The experiment is naturally one for the fed eral government to undertake but it need not be costly Three experimental stations  one in the northern part of Nebraska one in Texas and one in Arizona  would serve the needs of a thorough trial Ten thousand dollars per annum at each station should meet all the expenses of a sufficient trial at least until it was proven that the experiment would be successful If we add the expenses of a trav elling student of wild forageplants perhapsanother five thousand dollars we would have  eacth of them is led a copper conductor the a sufficient basis for practical work i If the foot of the machine thence along the masonry result should be to increase by only onetenth foundation it follows the ground as shown in the beastmaintaining power of our wild lands Figs 9 and 10 and arrives at a commutator the effort would be worth many millions per annum to the nation When we consider that the introduction of the species of Poa which receive the name of bluegrass has manifolded m the pasturagevalue of the regions where it flourishes it is evident that the project is worth consideratioh N S SHALER HISTORY OF THE APPLI ELECTRIC LIGHT TO COASTS OF

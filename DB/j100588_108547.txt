ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS BY THE REV JAMES BOOTH LLD FRS JC RECEIVED NOVEMBER 17 1851READ JANUARY 22 1852 SECTION LS I IN PLACING BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE FOLLOWING RESEARCHES ON THE GEOMETRICAL TYPES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS WHICH NEARLY COMPLETE MY INVESTIGATIONS ON THIS INTERESTING SUBJECT I MAY BE PERMITTED BRIEFLY TO ADVERT TO WHAT HAD ALREADY BEEN EFFECTED IN THIS DEPARTMENT OF GEOMETRICAL RESEARCH LEGENDRE TO WHOM THIS IMPORTANT BRANCH OF MATHEMATICAL SCIENCE OWES SO MUCH DEVISED A PLANE CURVE WHOSE RECTIFICATION MIGHT BE EFFECTED BY AN ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE FIRST ORDER SINCE THAT TIME MANY OTHER GEOMETERS HAVE FOLLOWED HIS EXAMPLE IN CONTRIVING SIMILAR CURVES TO REPRESENT EITHER BY THEIR QUADRATURE OR RECTIFICATION ELLIPTIC FUNCTIONS OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN MOST SUCCESSFUL IN DEVISING CURVES WHICH SHOULD POSSESS THE REQUIRED PROPERTIES MAY BE MENTIONED M GUDERMANN M VERHULST OF BRUSSELS AND M SERRET OF PARIS THESE GEOMETERS HOWEVER HAVE SUCCEEDED IN DERIVING FROM THOSE CURVES SCARCELY ANY OF THE PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS EVEN THE MOST ELEMENTARY THIS BARRENNESS IN RESULTS WAS DOUBTLESS OWING TO THE VERY ARTIFICIAL CHARACTER OF THE GENESIS OF THOSE CURVES DEVISED AS THEY WERE SOLELY TO SATISFY ONE CONDITION ONLY OF THE GENERAL PRO BLEM  IN 1841 A STEP WAS TAKEN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION MM CATALAN AND GUDERMANN IN THE JOURNALS OF LIOUVILLE AND CRELLE SHOWED HOW THE ARCS OF SPHERICAL CONIC SEC TIONS MIGHT BE REPRESENTED BY ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS OF THE THIRD ORDER AND CIRCULAR FORM THEY DID NOT HOWEVER EXTEND THEIR INVESTIGATIONS TO THE CASE OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS OF THE THIRD ORDER AND LOGARITHMIC FORM NOR EVEN TO THAT OF THE FIRST ORDER THESE CASES STILL REMAINED WITHOUT ANY ANALOGOUS GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATIVE A BLEMISH TO THE THEORY SOME YEARS AGO WHEN ENGAGED IN THE DISCUSSION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE ROTATION OF A RIGID BODY ROUND A FIXED POINT BY THEHELP OF AN AUXILIARY ELLIPSOID I HAD CONTINU ALLY BROUGHT UNDER MY NOTICE IN THE COURSE OF MY INVESTIGATIONS

SECTIONS IT ACCORDINGLY BECAME NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD GIVE ESPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE NATURE OF THOSE CURVES I SUCCEEDED IN SHOWING THAT THE ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE FIRST ORDER WHICH IS MERELY A PARTICULAR CASE OF THE CIRCULAR FORM OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS OF THE THIRD ORDER REPRESENTS A SPHERICAL CONIC SECTION WHOSE PRINCIPAL ARCS HAVE A CER TAIN RELATION TO EACH OTHER BESIDES I WAS SO FORTUNATE AS TO HIT UPON THE TRUE GEO METRICAL REPRESENTATIVE OF AN ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE THIRD ORDER AND LOGARITHMIC FORM I DISCOVERED IT TO BE THE CURVE OF INTERSECTION OF A RIGHT ELLIPTIC CYLINDER BY A PARA BOLOID OF REVOLUTION HAVING ITS AXIS COINCIDENT WITH THAT OF THE CYLINDER THESE RE SEARCHES WERE PUBLISHED IN THE EARLY PART OF THE PRESENT YEAR THERE STILL REMAINED WITHOUT INVESTIGATION THE CASE WHEN THE PARAMETER IS NEGATIVE AND GREATER THAN L THE GEOMETRICAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THIS PECULIAR FORM I ANNOUNCED TO BE A CURVE WHICH I CALLED THE LOGARITHMIC HYPERBOLA IN THE THEORY OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS P 159 I HAVE SAID  IF A RIGHT CYLINDER STANDING ON A PLANE HYPERBOLA AS A BASE BE SUBSTI TUTED FOR THE ELLIPTIC CYLINDER THE CURVE OF INTERSECTION MAY BE NAMED THE LOGARITHMIC HYPERBOLA IT WILL HAVE FOUR INFINITE BRANCHES WHOSE ASYMPTOTE WILL BE THE INFINITE ARCS OF TWO EQUAL PLANE PARABOLAS THIS CURVE AND NOT THE SPHERICAL ELLIPSE IS THE TRUE ANALOGUE OF THE CONMMON HYPERBOLA NO DEMONSTRATION HOWEVER OF THESE PRO PERTIES WAS GIVEN IN THAT TREATISE THE MAIN OBJECT OF THE FOLLOWING PAPER IS TO PROVE THAT ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS OF EVERY ORDER THE PARAMETER TAKING ANY VALUE WHATEVER BETWEEN POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE INFINITY REPRESENT THE INTERSECTIONS OF SURFACES OF THE SECOND ORDER TO THESE CURVES MAY BE GIVEN THE APPROPRIATE NAME OF HYPERCONIC SECTIONS THESE SURFACES DIVIDE THEMSELVES INTO TWO CLASSES OF WHICH THE SPHERE AND THE PARABOLOID OF REVOLUTION ARE THE RESPECTIVE TYPES FROM THE ONE ARISE THE CIRCULAR FUNCTIONS FROM THE OTHER THE LOGARITHMIC AND EXPONENTIAL THE CIRCULAR INTEGRAL OF THE THIRD ORDER IS DERIVED FROM THE SPHERE WHILE THE LOGARITHMIC FUNCTION OF THE SAME ORDER IS FOUNDED ON THE PARABOLOID OF REVOLUTION ALTHOUGH IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES I HAVE FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLICITY DERIVED THE PROPERTIES OF THOSE CURVES OR OF THE INTEGRALS WHICH REPRESENT THEM FROM THE INTER SECTIONS OF THESE NORMAL SURFACES  THE SPHERE AND THE PARABOLOIDWITH CERTAIN CYLIN DRICAL SURFACES YET THE INTERSECTIONS SO PRODUCED MAY BE CONSIDERED AS THE INTER SECTIONS OF THESE NORMAL SURFACES WITH VARIOUS OTHER SURFACES OF THE SECOND ORDER LET UNDO

MAKE THE EQUATION UFJVO REPRESENT A NONCENTRAL SUR FACE INSTEAD OF A CENTRAL ONE OR VICE VERSD ALTHOUGH A REMARKABLE RELATION EXISTS BETWEEN THE AREAS AND LENGTHS OF SOME OF THESE HYPERCONICS SUCH AS THE CIRCLE AND THE SPHERICAL ELLIPSE YET MORE DISTINCTLY TO SHOW THE ANALOGY WHICH PERVADES ALL THOSE CURVES I HAVE NOT HAD RECOURSE IN ANY CASE TO THE METHOD OF  ELLIPTIC QUADRATURES AS IT IS TERMED WE CANNOT ADMIT SUCH A VIOLATION OF THE LAW OF GEOMETRICAL CONTINUITY AS TO SUPPOSE THAT WHILE A FUNCTION IN ONE STATE REPRESENTS A CURVE LINE IN ANOTHER IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING IT MUST EXPRESS AN AREA SUCH CAN ONLY BE TAKEN AS A CONVENTIONAL EXPLANATION UNTIL THE REAL ONE CHARACTERIZED BY THE SIMPLICITY OF TRUTH SHALL PRESENT ITSELF IN THE COURSE OF THESE INVESTIGATIONS IT WILL BE SHOWN THAT THE FORMULK FOR THE COMPARISON OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS WHICH ARE GIVEN BY LEGENDRE AND OTHER WRITERS ON THIS SUBJECT FOLLOW SIMPLY AS GEOMETRICAL INFERENCES FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPERTIES OF THOSE CURVES AND THAT THE ORDINARY CONIC SECTIONS ARE MERELY PARTICULAR CASES OF THOSE MORE GENERAL CURVES ABOVE REFERRED TO UNDER THE NAME OF HYPERCONIC SECTIONS IT WILL DOUBTLESS APPEAR NOT A LITTLE SINGULAR THAT THE PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES OF THOSE FUNCTIONS THEIR CLASSIFICATION THEIR TRANSFORMATIONS THE COMPARISON OF INTEGRALS OF THE THIRD ORDER WITH CONJUGATE OR RECIPROCAL PARAMETERS WERE ALL INVESTIGATED AND DEVELOPED BEFORE GEOMETERS HAD ANY IDEA OF THE TRUE GEOMETRICAL ORIGIN OF THOSE FUNC TIONS IT IS AS IF THE FORMULE OF TRIGONOMETRY HAD BEEN DERIVED FROM AN ALGEBRAICAL DEFINITION BEFORE THE GEOMETRICAL CONCEPTION OF THE CIRCLE HAD BEEN ADMITTED AS TRIGONOMETRY MAY BE DEFINED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROPERTIES OF CIRCULAR ARCS WHETHER DESCRIBED ON A PLANE OR ON THE SURFACE OF A SPHERE SO THIS HIGHER TRIGONO METRY OR THE THEORY OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS MAY BEST BE INTERPRETED AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RELATIONS WHICH EXIST BETWEEN THE ARCS OF HYPERCONIC SECTIONS INDEED IT MAY WITH TRUTH BE ASSERTED THAT NEARLY ALL THE PRINCIPAL FUNCTIONS ON WHICH THE RESOURCES OF ANALYSIS HAVE CHIEFLY BEEN EXHAUSTED WHETHER THEY BE CIRCULAR LOGARITHMIC EXPONENTIAL OR ELLIPTIC ARISE OUT OF THE SOLUTION OF THIS ONE GENERAL PRO BLEM TO DETERMINE THE LENGTH OF AN ARC OF A HYPERCONIC SECTION IT MAY BE SAID WE CANNOT BY THIS METHOD DERIVE ANY PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTE GRALS WHICH MAY NOT ALGEBRAICALLY BE DEDUCED FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL EXPRESSIONS APPROPRIATELY ASSUMED BUT SURELY NO ONE WILL ASSERT THAT THE PROPERTIES OF CURVE LINES SHOULD BE ALGEBRAICALLY DEVELOPED WITHOUT ANY REFERENCE

GEOMETRICAL BASIS OF THIS THEORY WOULD DOUBTLESS LONG SINCE HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED HAD NOT GEOMETERS SOUGHT TO DISCOVER THE TYPES OF THOSE FUNCTIONS AMONG PLANE CURVES THEY WERE BEGUILED INTO THIS COURSE BY OBSERVING THAT IN ONE CASE THAT OF THE SECOND ORDERTHE REPRESENTATIVE CURVE IS OBVIOUSLY A PLANE ELLIPSE HENCE THEY WERE LED BY A SEEMING ANALOGY TO SEARCH FOR THE TYPES OF THE OTHER INTEGRALS AMONG PLANE CURVES ALSO THE AUTHOR HOPES IN A FUTURE COMMUNICATION TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY THE PRESENT HAVING GROWN UNDER HIS HANDS BEYOND THE LIMITS HE ANTICIPATED TO EXTEND HIS RE SEARCHES TO ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS WITH IMAGINARY PARAMETERS AND TO SHOW THE TRUE GEOMETRICAL MEANING OF SUCH EXPRESSIONS IT HAS LONG BEEN KNOWN THAT BY THE AID OF THE IMAGINARY TRANSFORMATION SIN PV7I TANG4 WE MAY PASS FROM THE LOGA RITHMIC TO THE CIRCULAR TYPE AND CONVERSELY BUT IT HAS NOT HOWEVER BEEN OBSERVED THAT THIS TRANSFORMATION ENABLES US TO EFFECT THIS TRANSITION BECAUSE IT CHANGES THE ALGEBRAIC EXPRESSION FOR THE ARC OF A PARABOLA INTO THAT FOR A CIRCULAR ARC OR AREA AND CONVERSELY THE STRIKING ANALOGIES DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE FORMULAE OF THE TRIGONOMETRY OF THE CIRCLE AND THAT OF THE PARABOLA WILL BE FOUND VERY CURIOUS AND INSTRUCTIVE I HAVE ATTEMPTED THUS TO PLACE ON ITS TRUE GEOMETRICAL BASIS A SOMEWHAT ABSTRUSE DEPARTMENT OF ANALYSIS AND TO CLEAR UP THE ELEMENTARY NOTIONS FROM WHICH IT MAY WITH THE UTMOST SIMPLICITY BE DEVELOPED IT IS ONLY IN THE MATURITY OF A SCIENCE THAT THE RELATIONS WHICH BIND TOGETHER ITS CARDINAL IDEAS BECOME SIMPLIFIED AN AUTHOR WHOT HAS HIMSELF CONTRIBUTED MUCH TO THE

PARAMETER P IN THE EXPRESSION K   THE MODULUS WE SHALL ASSUME P MN A V 1P SON TO BE INVARIABLE AND LESS THAN 1 IN THIS PROGRESS FROM SO TO  OO THE PARAMETER PASSES THROUGH THIRTEEN DISTINCT VALUES EACH OF WHICH WILL CAUSE A VARIATION IN THE SPECIES OR PROPERTIES OF THE HYPERCONIC SECTION THE REPRESENTATIVE CURVE OF THE GIVEN ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE WE MAY OBSERVE THAT THE GENERATING SURFACE IN PASSING FROM A SPHERE TO A PARABOLOID IN ITS STATE OF TRANSITION BECOMES A PLANE IT IS SOMEWHAT REMARKABLE THAT THE COMMON FORM OF THE ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE FIRST ORDER DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPLICITLY CONTAINED IN CASES II AND VIII FOR IN THE CIRCULAR FORM OF THE THIRD ORDER WHEN THE PARAMETER IS EQUAL TO THE MODULUS I WE CAN REDUCE THE THIRD ORDER TO THE FIRST THE REASON WHY THE FIRST FORM OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL DOES NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE IS THIS IN THE THIRTEEN CASES GIVEN THE ORIGIN IS PLACED AT THE CENTRE OR SYMMETRICALLY WITH RESPECT TO THE REPRESENTED CURVE WHEN THE ELLIPTIC INTEGRAL OF THE FIRST ORDER IS GIVEN IN THE USUAL FORM WITHOUT A PARAMETER IT REPRESENTS A SPHERICAL PARABOLA BUT THE ORIGIN IS NON SYMMETRICAL THAT IS THE ORIGIN

CERTAIN DECREMENT THE SAME REASONING WILL HOLD AS WELL WHEN WE TAKE ANY OTHER LIMITS BESIDES 0 AND 2 2 THESE CONSIDERATIONS NATURALLY LEAD TO THE PROCESS OF DIFFERENTIATION UNDER THE SIGN OF

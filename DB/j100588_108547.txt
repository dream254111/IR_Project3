Elliptic Integrals By the Rev JAMES BOOTH LLD FRS Jc Received November 17 1851Read January 22 1852 SECTION Ls I IN placing before the Royal Society the following researches on the geometrical types of elliptic integrals which nearly complete my investigations on this interesting subject I may be permitted briefly to advert to what had already been effected in this department of geometrical research LEGENDRE to whom this important branch of mathematical science owes so much devised a plane curve whose rectification might be effected by an elliptic integral of the first order Since that time many other geometers have followed his example in contriving similar curves to represent either by their quadrature or rectification elliptic functions Of those who have been most successful in devising curves which should possess the required properties may be mentioned M GUDERMANN M VERHULST of Brussels and M SERRET of Paris These geometers however have succeeded in deriving from those curves scarcely any of the properties of elliptic integrals even the most elementary This barrenness in results was doubtless owing to the very artificial character of the genesis of those curves devised as they were solely to satisfy one condition only of the general pro blem  In 1841 a step was taken in the right direction MM CATALAN and GUDERMANN in the journals of Liouville and Crelle showed how the arcs of spherical conic sec tions might be represented by elliptic integrals of the third order and circular form They did not however extend their investigations to the case of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form nor even to that of the first order These cases still remained without any analogous geometrical representative a blemish to the theory Some years ago when engaged in the discussion of the problem of the rotation of a rigid body round a fixed point by thehelp of an auxiliary ellipsoid I had continu ally brought under my notice in the course of my investigations the sections of a sphere by a concentric cone or as they now are generally named spherical conic  LEGENDRE a cherche a reprdsenter en general la fonction dig c p par un are de courbe mais Ses ten

sections It accordingly became necessary that I should give especial attention to the nature of those curves I succeeded in showing that the elliptic integral of the first order which is merely a particular case of the circular form of elliptic integrals of the third order represents a spherical conic section whose principal arcs have a cer tain relation to each other Besides I was so fortunate as to hit upon the true geo metrical representative of an elliptic integral of the third order and logarithmic form I discovered it to be the curve of intersection of a right elliptic cylinder by a para boloid of revolution having its axis coincident with that of the cylinder These re searches were published in the early part of the present year There still remained without investigation the case when the parameter is negative and greater than l The geometrical representative of this peculiar form I announced to be a curve which I called the Logarithmic hyperbola In the Theory of Elliptic Integrals p 159 I have said  If a right cylinder standing on a plane hyperbola as a base be substi tuted for the elliptic cylinder the curve of intersection may be named the logarithmic hyperbola It will have four infinite branches whose asymptote will be the infinite arcs of two equal plane parabolas This curve and not the spherical ellipse is the true analogue of the conmmon hyperbola No demonstration however of these pro perties was given in that treatise The main object of the following paper is to prove that Elliptic Integrals of every order the parameter taking any value whatever between positive and negative infinity represent the intersections of surfaces of the second order To these curves may be given the appropriate name of Hyperconic sections These surfaces divide themselves into two classes of which the sphere and the paraboloid of revolution are the respective types from the one arise the circular functions from the other the logarithmic and exponential The circular integral of the third order is derived from the sphere while the logarithmic function of the same order is founded on the paraboloid of revolution Although in the following pages I have for the sake of simplicity derived the properties of those curves or of the integrals which represent them from the inter sections of these normal surfaces  the sphere and the paraboloidwith certain cylin drical surfaces yet the intersections so produced may be considered as the inter sections of these normal surfaces with various other surfaces of the second order Let UNDO be the equation of the sphere or paraboloid and VO the equation of the cylinder The simultaneous equations U0 VO give the equations of the curve of intersection Let f be any abstract number whatever then Uf Vo is the equation of another surface of the second order passing through the curve of in tersection Let UO be the equation of a sphere for example Accordingly as we assign suitable values to the numberf we may make the equation UfVO repre sent any central surface of the second order But we cannot by any substitution or  The Theory of Elliptic Integrals and the Properties of Surfaces of

make the equation UfJVO represent a noncentral sur face instead of a central one or vice versd Although a remarkable relation exists between the areas and lengths of some of these hyperconics such as the circle and the spherical ellipse yet more distinctly to show the analogy which pervades all those curves I have not had recourse in any case to the method of  elliptic quadratures as it is termed We cannot admit such a violation of the law of geometrical continuity as to suppose that while a function in one state represents a curve line in another immediately succeeding it must express an area Such can only be taken as a conventional explanation until the real one characterized by the simplicity of truth shall present itself In the course of these investigations it will be shown that the formulk for the comparison of elliptic integrals which are given by LEGENDRE and other writers on this subject follow simply as geometrical inferences from the fundamental properties of those curves and that the ordinary conic sections are merely particular cases of those more general curves above referred to under the name of hyperconic sections It will doubtless appear not a little singular that the principal properties of those functions their classification their transformations the comparison of integrals of the third order with conjugate or reciprocal parameters were all investigated and developed before geometers had any idea of the true geometrical origin of those func tions It is as if the formule of trigonometry had been derived from an algebraical definition before the geometrical conception of the circle had been admitted As trigonometry may be defined the development of the properties of circular arcs whether described on a plane or on the surface of a sphere so this higher trigono metry or the theory of elliptic integrals may best be interpreted as the development of the relations which exist between the arcs of hyperconic sections Indeed it may with truth be asserted that nearly all the principal functions on which the resources of analysis have chiefly been exhausted whether they be circular logarithmic exponential or elliptic arise out of the solution of this one general pro blem to determine the length of an arc of a hyperconic section It may be said we cannot by this method derive any properties of elliptic inte grals which may not algebraically be deduced from the fundamental expressions appropriately assumed But surely no one will assert that the properties of curve lines should be algebraically developed without any reference to their geometrical types We might from algebraical expressions suitably chosen derive every known property of curve lines without having in any instance a conception of the geometrical types  En

developed by a method the inverse of that pursued in establishing the formulae of common trigonometry In the latter case the geometrical type was giventhe circleto determine the alge braical relations of its arcs In the theory of elliptic integrals the relations of the arcs of unknown curves are given to determine the curves themselves This is briefly the object of the present paper The true geometrical basis of this theory would doubtless long since have been developed had not geometers sought to discover the types of those functions among plane curves They were beguiled into this course by observing that in one case that of the second orderthe representative curve is obviously a plane ellipse Hence they were led by a seeming analogy to search for the types of the other integrals among plane curves also The author hopes in a future communication to the Royal Society the present having grown under his hands beyond the limits he anticipated to extend his re searches to elliptic integrals with imaginary parameters and to show the true geometrical meaning of such expressions It has long been known that by the aid of the imaginary transformation sin pv7I tang4 we may pass from the loga rithmic to the circular type and conversely but it has not however been observed that this transformation enables us to effect this transition because it changes the algebraic expression for the arc of a parabola into that for a circular arc or area and conversely The striking analogies developed between the formulae of the trigonometry of the circle and that of the parabola will be found very curious and instructive I have attempted thus to place on its true geometrical basis a somewhat abstruse department of analysis and to clear up the elementary notions from which it may with the utmost simplicity be developed It is only in the maturity of a science that the relations which bind together its cardinal ideas become simplified An author whot has himself contributed much to the progress of mathematical science well observes qui il est bien rare quune th6orie sorte sous sa forme la plus simple des mains de son premier auteur Nous pensons quon sert peutetre plus encore la

of b so that i2j2 1 The symbol c used by writers on this subject to designate the modulus was adopted by analogy from the formula for the rectification of a plane elliptic arc by an integral of the second order Although in the circular forms of the third order it still signifies a certain ellipticity yet it has no longer the same signification in the usual formn of the first order or in the logarithmic form of the thirdDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 315 Instead of the usual symbol A01 c2 sin2pV1 i2 sinkp s has been substi tuted when i is the mlodulus Should it become necessary to designate the ampli tude the expression may be written VIN or VL For the elliptic integrals of the first and second orders which are usually written Fp and Ejp I have substituted  and fdvJ The surface of revolution may be named the generating surface while the intersecting surface is always a cylin drical surface The parameter of which p is the general symbol we shall suppose to vary from positive to negative infinity and to pass through all intermediate states of magnitude The nature of the representative curve will depend on the value assigned to the parameter p in the expression K   The modulus we shall assume P mn A V 1P son to be invariable and less than 1 In this progress from so to  oo the parameter passes through thirteen distinct values each of which will cause a variation in the species or properties of the hyperconic section the representative curve of the given elliptic integral In the following Table we may observe that the generating surface in passing from a sphere to a paraboloid in its state of transition becomes a plane It is somewhat remarkable that the common form of the elliptic integral of the first order does not appear in the Table although it is implicitly contained in cases II and VIII for in the circular form of the third order when the parameter is equal to the modulus i we can reduce the third order to the first The reason why the first form of elliptic integral does not appear in the Table is this in the thirteen cases given the origin is placed at the centre or symmetrically with respect to the represented curve When the elliptic integral of the first order is given in the usual form without a parameter it represents a spherical parabola but the origin is non symmetrical that is the origin is placed at a focus See Theory of Elliptical In tegrals p 33 Instead of p the general symbol for the parameter we may substitute for it parti cular values such as 1 m or n as the case may require The

SECTION IOn the Spherical Ellipse III A spherical ellipse inay be defined as the curve of intersection of a cone of the second degree with a concentric sphere In the spherical ellipse there are two points analogous to the foci of the plane ellipse such that the sum of the arcs of the great circles drawn from those points to any point on the curve is constant Let rz and 03 be the principal semiangles of the cone 2V and 23 are therefore the principal arcs of the spherical ellipse Let two right lines be drawn from the vertex of the cone in the plane of the angle 2a making with the in ternal axe of the cone equal angles a such that COS   COS 2 These lines are usually called focals or thefocal lines of the cone The points inDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 317 which they meet the surface of the sphere are termed the foci of the spherical ellipse IV Every umbilical surface of the second order has two concentric circular sections whose planes in the case of cones pass through the greater of the external axes Per pendiculars drawn to the planes of those sections passing through the vertex they may be called the CYCLIC AXES of the conemake with

the vertex and perpendicular to the suc cessive sides of the cone This series of planes will envelope a second cone which usually is called the supplemental cone to the former The cones are so related that the planes of the circular sections of the one are perpendicular to the focals of the other and conversely V The equation of the spherical ellipse may be found as follows from simple geometrical considerations Let 2a and 2 be the greatest and least vertical angles of the cone the origin of coordinates being placed at the common centre of the sphere and cone Let the in ternal axis of the cone meet the surface of the sphere in the point Z which may be taken as the pole Let p be an arc of a great circle drawn from the point Z to any point Q on the curve 4 being the angle which the plane of this circle makes with the plane of 2ac we shall have for the polar equation of the spherical ellipse 1 cos2 sin24 tankp tank  tanki3 Tro show this through the point Z let a tangent plane be drawn to

spherical base of the cone The plane of the great circle passing through Z and Q will cut the plane base of the cone in the radius vector R and if we write A and B for the semniaxes of this ellipse

the elliptic integrals are of the third order and circular form with negative parameters We shahl now proceed to show that the same arc may be ex pressed by an elliptic integral of the third order and circular form having a positive parameter It is shown in most elementary treatises on the integral calculus in its applica tion to the rectification of plane curves that if p the perpendicular let

the rectification of a spherical curve the intersection of a cone of any order with a concentric sphere Let a point Z be assumed on the surface of the sphere Fig 3 as pole and through this point a tangent plane ZAQB or 0 to the sphere being drawn the cone whose ver tex is at 0 the centre of the sphere and which passes through the given spherical curve will cut this tangent plane 0 in a plane curve AQB whose rectification may be effected when possible by 31 Now a tangent plane OQP or T may be conceived as drawn touching  the cone and cutting the tangent plane 0 in a right a line QP or t which will be a tangent to the plane curve A    in 0 It will also cut the sphere in an are of a great 2 circle zzm which will touch the spherical curve in x Let Q the distance QO of the point of

But this integral is we know the expression for an arc of a common parabola whose semiparameter is k measured from the vertex of the curve to a point on it where its tangent makes the angle l with the ordinate Thus the difference between two elliptic arcs measured from the vertices of the curve which in the plane ellipse may as we know be expressed by a right line and in the spherical ellipse by an arc of a circle as shown in Art XV will in the logarithmic ellipse be expressed by an arc of a parabola As a parabolic arc can be rectified only by a logarithm we may hence see the propriety of the term logarithmic by which this function is designated XXXIX If from the vertex A of a paraboloid an arc of a parabola be drawn at right angles to a parabolic section of the paraboloid it will meet this parabolic sec tion at its vertex Let the arc AQ be drawn at right angles Fig 15 to the parabolic section Qv of the paraboloid the point Q is the vertex of the parabola Qv A Draw QT and Qt tangents to the arcs QA and Qv Then QT and Qt are at right angles As QT is a tangent to a principal section passing through the axis of the paraboloid it will meet this axis in a point T and as Qt is a tangent to the surface of the paraboloid it will be perpendicular to the  normal to the surface QN Now as Qt is perpendicular to QT and to QN it is perpendicular to the plane QTN which passes through them and therefore to every line in this 7 plane and therefore to the axis AN or to any line parallel to it as the diameter Qn Hence as the tangent Qt to the parabola Qv is perpendicular to the diameter Qn Q is the vertex of the parabola Hence in the logarithmic ellipse one extremity of the protangent arc is always the vertex of the parabola which touches the logarithmic ellipse at its other extremityDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 353 This is a very important theorem as the protangents are arcs of equal parabolas all measured from the vertices of the parabolas Hence also the length of the protan gent arc depends solelv on its normal angle As an arc of a circle may be expressed by the notation ssin  y being the ordi nate and k the radius so in like manner an arc of a parabola may be designated by the form stan Q y being the ordinate and k the semiparameter To distinguish the parabolic arc from the circular arc the former may be written srml Again as we say in the case of the circle the angle w and the arc kw w being the angle con tained between the normals to the curve at the extremities of the arc so in the para bola we may write o for the angle between the normals and ko for the corre sponding parabolic arc In the case of the parabola the are is always supposed to be measured from the vertex in the circle the arc may be measured from any point as every point is a vertex XL Resuming the equation 157 O d7VPlsiRsin4k2 We shall now proceed to develope the first integral of the second side of this equation As the integral is

circular with a paraboloid whose semiparameter k0  therefore the dimensions of the paraboloid being indefinitely diminished in magni tude this intersection of a finite circular cylinder by a paraboloid indefinitely atte nuated must take place at an infinite altitude We naturally should suppose that the section of a cylinder which indefinitely approaches in its limit to a circular cylinder by a paraboloid of revolution would be a circle yet the fact is not so The inter section of these surfaces instead of being a circle is a logarithmic ellipse whose rectification may be effected by an elliptic integral of the second order as we shall now proceed to show In the first place let us conceive the paraboloid as of definite magnitude and the cylinder to be elliptical its semiaxes as before being a and b Then as a and b are the ordinates of a parabola at the points where the elliptic cylinder meets the para boloid at its greatest and least distances from the axis of the surfaces

that quadrants of the spherical or logarithmic ellipse may be expressed by the help of integrals of the first and second orders XLIV It is not difficult to show that this particular case of the

case of the formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order and logarithmic form We perceive that this formula results from the comparison of two expressions for the same are of a common hyperbola We may also see that it is the limiting case of the general formula for the comparison of elliptic integrals of the third order having reciprocal parameters a formula which in like manner has been deduced from the comparison of two expressions for the same are of the logarithmic hyperbola It is also evident that j2 tan being the difference between tan qI and s it is the difference between tangents one drawn to the hyperbola the other to the plane ellipse for tanpVI denotes the portion of a tangent to a hyperbola between the point of contact and the perpendicular on it from the centre and CiO2 f denotes a similar quantity in an ellipse this differ ence is precisely analogous to the expression which occurs in 284 cos3u djcosT which denotes the difference between two parabolic arcs one drawn a tangent to the logarithmic hyperbola the other a tangent to the logarithmic ellipse SECTION VILOn the Values of complete Elliptic Integrals of the third order LIII We have hitherto investigated the properties and lengths of elliptic curves on the supposition that the generating surface whether sphere or paraboloid was inva riable and that the lengths of the curves were made up by the summation of the elements produced by the successive values given to the amplitude p between certain limits 0 and 2 suppose if the arcs are to be quadrants Thus the length of the quadrant is obtained by adding together the successive increments which result from the successive additions indefinitely small which are made to the amplitude We may however proceed on another principle to effect the rectification of those curves If to fix our ideas we want to determine the length of a quadrant of the spherical ellipse we may imagine the vertical cylinder which we shall suppose invariable to be successively intersected by a series of all possible concentric spheres Every quadrant will differ in length from the one immediately preceding it in the series by an infinitesimal quantity and if we take the least of these quadrants and add to it the successive elements by which one quadrant differs from the next immediately preceding we shall thus obtain the length of a quadrant of the required spherical ellipse equal to the least quadrant which can be described on the elliptic cylinder plus the sum of all the elements between the least quadrant and the required one Thus for example the least quadrant which can be drawn on an elliptic vertical cylinder is its section by an horizontal plane or a quadrant of the plane ellipseDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 375 whose semiaxes are a and b In this case the radius of the sphere is infinite The least sphere is that whose radius is a and which cuts the cylinder in its circular sections Hence the greatest spherical elliptic quadrant is the quadrant of the circle whose radius is a All the spherical elliptic quadrants will therefore be comprised between the quadrants of an ellipse and of a circle whose radius is a Any quadrant therefore of a given spherical ellipse is equal to a quadrant of a plane ellipse plus a certain increment or to a quadrant of a circle minus a certain decrement The same reasoning will hold as well when we take any other limits besides 0 and 2 2 These considerations naturally lead to the process of differentiation under the sign of integration because we cannot express under a finite known form the arc of a spherical or logarithmic ellipse and then differentiate the expression so found with respect to a quantity which hitherto has been taken as a constant We may conceive the generation of successive curves of this kind to take place in another manner Let us imagine an invariable sphere to be cut by a succession of concentric cylinders indefinitely near to each other and generated after a given law These cylinders will cut the sphere in a series of spherical ellipses any one of which will differ from the one immediately preceding by an indefinitely small quantity If we sum all these indefinitely small quantities or in other words integrate the ex pression so found we shall discover the finite difference between any two curves of the series separated by a finite interval One of the limits being a known curve the other may thus be determined To apply this reasoning In the following investigations we shall assume the generating sphere to be invarii able and the modulus i with theamplitude p to be constant The intersecting cylinder we shall suppose to vary from curve to curve on the surface of the sphere a2 bA But i is constant and i2   see 27 Now a and b being the semiaxes of the base of the cylinder it follows that the bases of all the varying cylinders are con centric and similar ellipses

theorem388 DR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS will enable us to express an arc of a parabola taken anywhere along the curve as the sum or difference of an apsidal arc and a

When the arcs AC AB together constitute a focal arc or an arc whose cord passes through the focus plX and h is the ordinate of the conjugate arc AD Hence we derive this theorem Anyfocal arc of a parabola is equal to the dif ference between the conjugate apsidal arc and its ordinate The relation between the amplitudes p and w in this case is sin2p1 Thus when the focal cord makes an angle of

by the distance between the vertex and its focus or as the protangent is 0 in the circle and the focus is the centre the question may be changed into what is the trigonometrical tangent of the are of a circle equal to the radius This question is answered by putting I for a in a and reverting the series 1  tan  3 al tan51 tan7 l  we should get in functions of the numbers of BERNOUILLI the value of tanl as is shown in most treatises on trigonometry Let us now make a like inquiry in the case of the parabola and ask what is the value of the amplitude which will give the difference between the arc of the parabola and its protangent equal to the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola Now if 0 be this angle we must have k  0g see 0 tan 0g But in general k 0 g sec 0 tan 0gyC

above equations we may derive el e1 elel sece 2 tanse 2 346 or tane1V175203015 whence e8657606 or e490 36 15 The corresponding arc of the parabola will be k0k1  j 45 c 347390 DR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS If we assume the theory of logarithms as known we may at once arrive at this value for in general  log sec0 tan 0 and as this is to be 1 we mnust have sec0 tan0e as before LXII If we now extend this inquiry and ask what is the magnitude of the amplitude of the arc of the parabola which shall render the difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent equal to n times the distance between the focus and the vertex we shall have as before by the terms of the question k 0g secO tanOng 348 But in general k 0 g secO tanogJ dO hence we must have n J0oiogsec0tanG or sec0 tanOe 349 Now we may solve this equation in two ways either by mAking n a given number and then determine the value of sec0tan0 which may be called the base Or we may assign an arbitrary value to sec0tanO and then derive the value of n Taking the latter course let for example sec0tan0 10 Then nloglO orI is the modulus of the second system of logarithms Hence if we assume any number of systems of logarithms on the same parabola and take their bases gsec0 tanG gsec0  tanl gsecG tan0  c the moduli of these successive systems will be the ratios of hayf the semiparameter to the successive differences between the base parabolic arcs and their protangents In the Napierian system g the distance from the focus to the vertex of the para bola is taken as 1 The difference between the parabolic arc and its protangent when equal to g gives gsec0tanOeg In the decimal system gsec0tan0 log and the difference between the corresponding parabolic arc and its protangent being ng if we make this difference ng equal to the arithmetical unit we shall have ng 1 or gmodulus of the system Hence in every system of logarithms whatever g the distance between the focus and the vertex of the parabola is the modulus of the system Every system of logarithms may be derived from the same parabola but the Napierian system in which the focal distance of the vertex is itself taken as the unit may justly be taken as the natural system In the same way we may consider that to be the natural system of circular trigonometry in which the radius is taken as the unit The modulus in the trigonometry of the parabola corresponds with the radius in the trigonometry of the circle But while in the trigonometry of the parabola the base is real in the circle it is imaginary In the parabola the angle of the base is given by the equation sec0tan0e In1 tie circle coAsVI sin LV1 andDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 391 making Y1 we get cos1V1 sin1eV1 Hence while el is the para bolic base e is the circular base Or as sece tane is the Napierian base coslI l sinl is the circular or imaginary base Thus Cosl N Sincos5N I sin5 Hence speaking more precisely imaginary numbers have real logarithms but an imaginary base We may always pass from the real logarithms of the parabola to the imaginary logarithms of the circle by changing tanO into 1 sini secO into cosa and el into ewl As in the parabola the angle 0 is nonperiodic its limit being while in the circle a has no limit it follows that while a number can have only one real or parabolic logarithm it may have innumerable imaginary or circular logarithms In the parabola we thus can shiow the geometrical origin of the magnitudes known as the base and the modulus We might too form systems of circular trigonometry analogous to different systems of logarithms We might refer the arc of a circle not to the radius but to some other arbitrary fixed line the diameter or any other sup pose Let the circumference be referred to the diameter then X will signify a whole circumference instead of a semicircle and 4 will represent a right angle Having on this system or any similar one found the lengths of the arcs which correspond to certain functions such as given sines or tangents we should multiply the results by some fixed number which we might call a modulus 2 in this example to reduce them to the standard system but such systems would obviously be useless If e be the angle which gives the difference between the parabolic arc and its pro tangent equal to g k ewe is the angle which will give this difference equal to 2g eL  is the angle which will give this difference equal to 3g and so on to any number of angles Hence in the circle if 5 be the angle which gives the circular arc equal to the radius 25 is the angle which will give an arc equal to twice the radius and so on for any number of angles This is of course selfevident in the case of the circle but it is instructive to point out the complete analogy which holds in the trigonometries of the circle and of the parabola LXIII The geometrical origin of the exponential theorem may thus be shown Assume two known logarithmic bases secovtano and sec3tanf3 and let us investigate the ratio of the differences of the corresponding parabolic arcs and their protangents Let sece tane be the Napierian base and let one difference be xvg and the other yg The ratio of these differences is therefore z if we make yAs Hence secztansecetanextex and seci3tanf3eY Therefore seco tanYeYsecftanf Or as yxz secoctansz

xl and Ae Hence Be LXIV Given the number to find its logarithm may be exhibited by the following geometrical construction Let OAP be a parabola Through the focus Odraw Fig 23 the perpendicular OQ to the axis AO Through A let a tangent of indefinite length be drawn On this tangent Q take the line AN to represent the given number Join NO and make the angle NOT always equal to the angle T  NOQ Draw TP at right angles to TO This line will touch the parabola in the point P and the arc of the A parabola APPT will be the logarithm of AN AO When ANAOthe unit g the angle NOQ is equal T to half a right angle Hence the point T in this case will coincide with A The parabolic arc therefore vanishes or the logarithm of 1 is 0 When sec0 tan0l 00 When the number is less than 1 the point N will fall below N in the position n Hence nOQ is greater than half a right angle There fore T will fall below the axis in the point TI and if we draw through T a tangent rT it will give the negative arc of the parabola Tp corresponding to the number An Fractional numbers or numbers between 1 and 0 must therefore be represented by the expression gsec0 tan 0 since tanG changes its sign When the number is 0 n coincides with A and the angle NOQ in this case is a right angle Therefore the point T will be the intersection of AT and OQ Hence Tr is at an infinite distance below the axis and therefore the logarithm of 0 is o Hence negative numbers have no logarithms at least no real ones and imaginary ones can only be educed by the transformation so often referred to and this leads us to seek them among the properties of the circle For as 0 always lies between 0 and a right angle or between 0 and the half of  sec0tan0 is altwlays positive hence negative numbers can have no real or parabolic logarithms but they may have ima ginary or circular logarithms for in the expression log cosV1 sina V1  we may maake a 2n I   and we shall get log  1  2n 1 zvT  1 hence also as the length of the parabolic arc TP without reference to the sign depends solely on the amplitude 0 it follows that the logarithm of sec0 tanO is equal to the logarithm of sec0 tan 0 As sec 0 tan0sec0 tan0 1 we may hence infer that the logarithm of any number is equal to the logarithm of its reciprocal with the sign changed When 0 is very large sec0tan02 tang nearly Hence if we represent a large number by an ordinate of a parabola whose focal distance to the vertex is 1 the differ ence between the corresponding arc and its protangents will represent its logarithm Aloneg the tangent to the vertex of the

in the parabola the protangent which is involved in the differential is evolved by the process of integration As in the parabola the perpendicular from the focus on the tangent bisects the angle between the radius vector and the axis of the curve so in the circle the radius vector OB drawn from the extremity of the diameter bisects the angle between the perpendicular OP and the diameter OA There are somne curious analogies between the parabola and the circle considered under this point of view In the parabola the points T T T which divide the lines g secO tan0 g sec0L0tan04L0 c into

perpendiculars from the focus is a right line or in other words while one end of a protangent rests on the parabola the other end rests on a right line So in the circle while one end of the protangent rests on the circle the other end rests on a cardioide whose diameter is equal to that of the circle and whose cusp is at 0 OPPA is the cardioide The length of the tangent AT to any point T is g tanO The length of the cardioide is 2G sins It is singular that the imaginary formulae in trigonometry have long been disco vered while the corresponding real expressions have escaped notice Indeed it was long ago observed by LAMBERT and by other geometersthe remark has been repeated in almost every treatise on the subject sincethat the ordinates of an equi lateral hyperbola might be expressed by real exponentials whose exponents are sectors of the hyperbola but the analogv being illusory never led to any useful results And the analogy was illusory from this that it so happens the length and area of a circle are expressed by the same function while the area of an equilateral hyperbola is a function of an are of a parabola The true analogue of the circle is the parabola LXV1 Let W be the

of angular magnitude has always been referred to the circle as its type so the calculus of logarithms may in precisely the same way be referred to the parabola as its type The obscurities which hitherto have hung over the geometrical theory of loga rithms have it is hoped been now removed It is possible to represent logarithms as elliptic integrals usually have been represented by curves devised to exhibit some special property only and accordingly such curves while they place before us the properties they have been constructed to represent fail generally to carry us any further The close analogies which connect the theory of logarithms with the pro perties of the circle will no longer appear inexplicable  The views above developed on the trigonometry of the parabola throw much light on a controversy long carried on between LEIBNlTz and J BERNOULLI on the subject of the logarithms of negative numbers LEIB NITZ insisted they were imaginary while BERNOULLI argued they were real and the same as the logarithms of equal positive numbers EULER espoused the side of the former while DALEMBERT coincided with the views of BERNOULLI Indeed if we derive the theory of logarithms from the properties of the hyperbola as geo meters always have done it will not be easy satisfactorily to answer the argument of BERNOULLIthat as an hyperbolic area represents the logarithm of a positive number denoted by the positive abscissa  x so a negative number according to conventional usage being represented by the negative abscissa x the corresponding hyperbolic area should denote its logarithm also All this obscurity is cleared up by the theory developed in the text which completely establishes the correctness of the views of LEXBNITZ and EULER396 DR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL

determine the inclination to the horizontal plane of the tangent drawn to any point of the spherical ellipse The spherical ellipse being taken as the curve of intersection of a cylinder by a sphere as in X through a side Rr of the cylinder let a plane be drawn it will cut the sphere in a small circle which will touch the spherical ellipse in the point r and will cut the base of the hemisphere in the right line RP which touches the base of the cylinder at the Fig 26 point R Let 0 be the centre of the sphere and Z the Z centre of the spherical hyperconic Through the line OZ let a plane be drawn at right angles to the plane of theA small circle RrrP it will cut the sphere in the arc of a great circle Zsr at right angles to the arc rr and as the three planes namely the horizontal plane the plane of the small circle and the plane of the great circle Z0Pr are mutually at right angles the right lines in which they intersect PR Px PO are mutually at right angles therefore P is the foot of the perpendicular drawn from the centre 0 of the base of the cylinder to the tangent RP which touches the curve P is also the centre of the small circle Armr since AB is a cord of the sphere Hence AT is a quadrant and therefore rx or v is the inclination of the element of the spherical ellipse at r to the base of the hemisphere Now ZO is the radius of the sphere and Pr that of the small circle RPO

value of tan p in 390 we shall get ta2ttano tanytan Q3 or va3 391 Hence the maximijum inclination to the plane of ay of the tangent to the spherical ellipse is equal to the difference between the principal semiarcs It is remarkable that the point of the curve which gives the maximum difference between the arcs which together constitute the quadrant of the spherical ellipse is not the point of greatest inclination For this point is found by making tan2tan  while the point of maxillmum difference is obtained by putting tan2psi This is the more worthy 9f notice as we shall find the two pointsthe point of maximum division and the point of greatest inclinationto coincide in the logarithmic ellipse If we take the two plane ellipses which are the projections of the spherical ellipse one being the perspective and the other the orthogonal projection and seek on these plane ellipses their points of maximum division we shall find that the angles which the perpendiculars on the tangents through these points of maximum division of those plane curves make with the principal are are the values which must be assigned to the amplitude p to determine the point where the tangent to the curve has the greatest inclination to the plane of xy and the point which divides the quadrant into two parts such that their difference shall be a maximum This is plain for the semniaxes of one

expression for the tangent of the maximum parabolic are ana logous to 385 and 391 We have only to take in the parabola whose semi parameter is k an arc whose ordinate is ab to determine the maximum

C l tanlx hence tangs 1m If we now make tan2P 1 tanX V1n a as we may infer from 171 Now substituting this value of tanX in 155 we shall get ab tanr Again if we differentiate the values of x y z given

tangent of the inclination of any curve to the plane of xy namely dz VL d 9 and make SX we shall get as before putting for tan2Xtan2S the value a dz ab 1Vd 2dy2 k  Hence the arcs have a common extremity since they have the same inclination to the plane of xy As tan2X is the value of tan2X which gives the maximum protangent ab in the plane ellipse the base of the cylinder it follows that the point of maximum division on the logarithmic ellipse is orthogonally projected into the point of maximum division on the plane ellipse and the corre sponding protangent in the latter ab is the ordinate of the parabolic arc which expresses the difference between the corresponding arcs of the former Thus while the arcs which together constitute the quadrant on the plane ellipse differ by the difference of the semiaxes ab the corresponding arcs of the logarithmic ellipse will differ by an arc of a parabola whose ordinate is ab LXXVI When the amplitude p is given by the equation tanp  or when the protangent is a maximum the corresponding arc of the spherical ellipse or of the logarithmic ellipse may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only This may be shown as follows When tanp the arcs a and a of the spherical ellipse or the arcs z and S of the logarithmic ellipse together make up the quadrant C Hence ocrC or SC But we have also a  6a7 as in 52 and S r as

first and second orders onlv while r is an arc either of a circle or of a parabola Hence an elliptic integral of the third order whose amplitude p tan may be expressed by functions of the first and second orders only SECTION XOn Derivative H yperconic Sections LXXVII We shall now proceed to show that when a hyperconic section is given whether it be spherical or paraboloidal we may frorn it derive a series of curves whose moduli and parameters shall decrease or increase according to a certain law so that ultimately the rectification of these curves may be reduced to the calculation of circular or parabolic arcs or in other words to circular functions or logarithms We shall also show that all these derived curves together with the original curve may be traced on the same generating surface i e on the same sphere or paran boloidDR BOOTH ON THE GEOMETRICAL PROPERTIES OF ELLIPTIC INTEGRALS 407 In 186 we have shown that the rectification of a plane ellipse whose semiaxes are a and b

parameter of the original function we start from be positive or negative the parameter of the first derived integral will always be positive Indeed it is necessary that this should be the case because the parameters of the derived functions increasing or diminishing as they do must at length pass from between the limits 1 and i2 Should they do so the integral would be no longer of the circular form but of the logarithmic Now we cannot pass from one of these forms to the other by any but an imaginary transformation This objection does not hold when the parameter is positive because the limits of the positive para meter are 0 and xo It is too worthy of remark that the first derived parameter is always the same whether we transform from positive or negative parameters Write mu nI  j 396 n is

Macmillan Company 1912 Jane Addams essays are always full of grace and dignity Few persons could take the great mass of evidence revealed by investigations of the social evil in Chicago eliminate the gruesome details and still give so clear an insight into its horrors and leave such a feeling of sympathy for its victims as Miss Addams No one can take exception to the treatment or fail to be roused by her arguments Just as slavery though strongly entrenched as a vested interest was finally destroyed so may prostitution This involves not merely a frontal attack on the evil and those who profit therefrom but more attention to the education of children the supervision of amusements and the raising of wages of working girls The elimination of disease must be sought In this new exercise of social control women must take active partanother reason in the authors opinion for the suffrage Alden Percy Democratic England Pp xii 271 Price 150 New York Macmillan Company 1912 Compared with several of the continental countries England began late to develop a program of social legislation But under the present liberal ministry the late beginning has been more than neutralized by a progress that bids fair soon to put England in the van of industrial nations that are striving to raise the weak to the level of the strong No more sympathetic nor telling picture of this movement could be outlined than this timely book affords The problem of the child of sweating and of the unemployed are portrayed from the standpoint of the legislation of the past decade sickness and old age are set forth as sources of ills both mitigable and removable by legislation and social action and housing municipal utilities and the uses of land likewise are treated as objects of govern mental concern The old laissezfaire attitude has indeed disappeared and in its stead has come the determination seconded by action that the bodies and spirits of men and women who have sacrificed themselves for the race shall no longer be trodden down by the hungry generations Antin Mary The Promised Land Pp xv 373 Price 175 Boston Hough ton Mifflin Company 1912 A remarkable story written in simple and fascinating fashion It is the auto biography of a woman who was born in Russia a Jewess whose family lost its possessions and sank into abject poverty The author came with her family to America early in her teens The gradual translation as it were into an American with most intense pride in our country and hopefulness as to its future is most encouraging in these days when the air is full of problems The volume deserves wide reading In quality it compares favorably with the best of such immigrant interpreters as Riis and Steiner 327328 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Bolton R P Building for Profit 2d Edition Pp 124 New York The DeVinne Press 1911 The second edition of Mr Boltons work which has just appeared while retaining the valuable portion of the first edition is more valuable through the intro duction of new matter Real estate owners and operators have come to regard the question of the suitability of buildings for different locations as a scientific matter upon the correct solution of which the profitableness of the investment directly depends Mr Bolton has pointed the way by which the ordinary indi vidual can work out this problem for himself Besides a great wealth of material upon the cost of buildings and the depre ciation and operating expenses of various types of building Mr Bolton lays down formulas by which the expediency of different building plans may be decided and a suitable type of building determined This volume should be in the library of every one interested in central business real estate and of every real estate broker dealing in

Houghton Mifflin Company 1912 A book much needed and one which will be of distinct value to lawyers publishers and laymen generally is found in the work on Copyright presented by Mr Bowker It shows an intimate acquaintance on the part of the author with what might be called copyright atmosphere which is at once useful and interesting Being intended for lay as well as law readers its methods are quite unlike Scrutton and Macgillivray and it is also quite dissimilar to Mr Drones work which however had a somewhat similar purpose The growth of the law in exactness both by reason of judicial interpretation and the Code of 1909 is well exhibited by a perusal of this and the last named work Mr Drone discussed with great learning questions then quite indeterminate and Mr Bowker is able to state the law definitely As a whole the work discloses infinite industry and brings together a mass of valuable information concerning the law of literary property much of which is not to be found in

addresses in which are given the usual statements made by those who radically oppose the initiative referendum and recall President Butler says that the referendum would degrade our legislative bodies and reduce them to intellectual moral and political impotence The initiative he avers to be the most preposterous and the most vicious of allBOOK DEPARTMENT 329 the proposals that have been brought forward in the name of direct democracy All that can possibly be accomplished by the initiative is to strike the heaviest possible blow at representative institutions and to remove the last inducement to bring able reflective and intelligent men to accept service in a legislative body He thinks that the recall will assist the initiative and referendum in diminishing the consistency the intelligence and the disinterestedness of govern ment because it will help to keep highminded and independent men from accept ing nomination and election to public office He believes that the proper pro cedure is to perfect our form of government but not to change it though he points out no particulars in which our present plan even needs perfecting Our fathers were endowed with rare insight by which they could lay well the noble founda tions of our government but to their children so far as one can glean from the monograph is not given sufficient insight to change even the details of the struc ture to be erected on the foundations the fathers so nobly laid The closing chapter is entitled The Revolt of the Unfit a revolt that primarily takes the form of attempts to lessen and to limit competition which is instinctively felt and with reason to be part of the struggle for existence and for success Carlile W W Monetary Economics Pp xii 307 Price 300 New York Longmans Green  Co 1912 This volume is made up partly of previously published articles and partly of new material It is in large part a criticism of current economic theory both from the standpoint of method and of foundation material Only the last three chapters deal with matters of a concretely practical nature As a fact however the whole book is an argument for the practicalizing of theory Words and phrases in economic usage are condemned unless they coincide with usage in the practical business of life Marginal terminology is flouted on this ground The reason ing of the marginalists is likewise condemned on several grounds In the first place a monetary society such as ours cannot be interpreted in terms of a Crusoe economy and in the second place the simplified psychology of mathematically inclined reasoning on value cannot supply an explanation of social value The gap between artificially simplified reasoning of this description and the realities of life is too wide to be bridged by the casual efforts of those who translate the law of diminishing utility into terms of price What such a casual attempt seems to bridge is in reality untold millenia of life and progress The Catholic Encyclopedia Volume XIII Pp

Court Pub lishing Company 1911 The interest that social thinkers have in the doctrine of acquired characters makes Dr Rignanos book important It is however of little use except to those who have already a fair knowledge of biology It shows that the defeat of the followers of Lamarck is not so decisive as it seemed a few years ago Of more importance than the book is an appendix on the mnemonic origin of the effective tendencies This chapter has no technical difficulties and is a fresh and invaluable statement of the newer memory doctrines No social thinker can afford to be ignorant of the ideas there presented Hemmeon J C The History of the British Post Office Pp xi 261 Price 200 Cambridge Harvard University Press 1912 Henderson Charles R Industrial Insurance in the United States Pp x 454 Price 200 Chicago University of Chicago Press 1911 This second edition of Hendersons Industrial Insurance contains few changes from the text of the first edition Statistics have in some cases but not all been brought down to date In the summary of European laws this change has been made In the chapters on The Insurance of Fraternal Societies and The Em ployers Liability Law there was an opportunity to note changes of consider able importance The new fraternal law passed by some fifteen or more states up to the present time might have been included but was not Likewise the enormous amount of legislation dealing with changes in the law of liability and substitution of plans of compensation was noted to the extent only of inserting in the appendix two new sections giving the text of the New York laws of 1910 providing 1 amendments to existing laws coupled with an elective compensa tion plan and 2 a compulsory compensation act for certain hazardous indus tries The latter has already been declared unconstitutional by the New York Court of Appeals These omissions may have been deliberate but one can hardly help wishing they had been included The changes of most importance made in this reprint were 1 the revision of the statistics of private industrial insurance companies bringing them down to date 2 the enlarging of the bibliography by the addition of several excellent books and government reports which have come out since the first publication of the volume and 3 the changes made in the Employers Benefit Association Plan of the International Harvester Company by the addition of an industrial accident department Hollingsworth C M From Freedom to Despotism Pp xiii 238 Price 100 Washington The Author This book has at least the distinction of creating and supporting a unique thesis The authors thesis is that the future course and ultimate outcome of the great modern movement toward universal democracy is to result ultimately in the virtual disappearance of free government and the substitution of despotism for freedom The word despotism the author uses not in an opprobrious sense but as a general term to denote any form of accepted and necessary absolutismBOOK DEPARTMENT 331 or autocracy with little or no constitutional limitations on the arbitrary powers of the individual ruler The author finds his chief arguments in support of his thesis in the dependent relation between economic conditions and the form and spirit of political institutions His conclusion that our republic will not last longer than 1950 he says is one arrived at as a strictly reasoned induction from the indisputable facts of the general economic social and political history of nations from the earliest times down to and including the conditions and tendencies of the present moment He discusses the dangers of democracy and economic concentration and finds that the inevitable consequences of the con centration of wealth is social degradation poverty and pauperism The transition from freedom to despotism to a modernized Cmesarism will take place through the declining power and prestige of American legislative bodies accompanied by gradual increase in the power of American executives Des potism is a consequence of economic fixity freedom the consequence of economic development When the great modern movement of economic develop mentworldembracing in its scope and converting to mans uses the highest forces of naturehas been completed an era will be reached in which despotic government will be practically universal Inglis A J The Rise of the High School in Massachusetts Pp vi 166 New York Columbia University Teachers College 1911 Dr Inglis traces in detail the origin and development of the high school in Massachusetts from 1821 when the English Classical High School of Boston was begun to 1860 when public secondary education seemed to have been com pletely established Being an historical survey the author makes no attempt to connect the conditions studied with the present status of secondary schooling in the state While the first public high school was established in 1821 it was not until after the enactment of the school law of 1827 that the growth of the modern high school began Then as now Massachusetts was the leader in popular education providing higher schools with the design of furnishing young men of the city Boston who are not intended for a collegiate course of study and who have enjoyed the usual advantages of the other public schools grades with a means of completing a good English education to fit them for active life It is interest ing to note that some of the problems of today such as making the high school the poor mans college and the danger of college domination were vital issues then The study provides in its outlines of the development of the different sub jects of the curriculum and the tables of studies with the number of students in each at different epochs a valuable means of comparison with the conditions and problems of today If the study of history aims to give the student a basis of comparison between the present and the past then this study is a good piece of historical research James J A and Sanford A H Government in State and Nation Pp xiv 341 Price 100 New York Charles Scribners Sons 1912 This well known text appears in a revised edition in which the references and political developments are brought down to 1912 As in the first edition the object332 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY is to give a short account of governmental activities for use in secondary schools The chapters are in language which the beginner can easily understand and show an excellent sense of proportion Kenngott George F The Record of a CityA Social Survey of Lowell Massa chusetts Pp xiv 257 Price 300 New York Macmillan Company 1912 If this survey succeeds in doing for Lowell what the Pittsburgh survey did for Pittsburgh Lowell will be indeed a city coming to itself The authors treatment covering history housing health living standards industrial conditions and recreation is broad and yet sufficiently based on fact to make it worth the care ful attention of the student As a typical New England textile town Lowell furnishes an interesting example of what has been produced by a century of American industrialism Most of the houses are good some are extraordinarily bad city health has been constantly improving recreational facilities are in creasing in number the city is in the grip of an absentee landlordism The real proprietors of the mills the stockholders live elsewhere and have little thought of Lowell save to draw dividends They have builded their tower of Babel on the banks of the Merrimac and the pride of life the thirst for gold the demand for cheap labor have brought hither a confusion of tongues that no Pentecost of love has yet transformed into a harmony of single devotion and united effort The outlook for Lowell is not gloomy the author is even optimistic The people he writes are for the most part well fed yet the city lacks a spirit of civic solidarity without which long permanent improvement in city conditions seems impossible While the author has failed to make the best use of his statistical material and while many of his facts are stated in questionable English the study is on the whole effective and valuable Lowry E B False Modesty Pp 110 Price 50 cents Chicago Forbes  Co 1912 Among the many recent attempts to state the problem of sex education and the necessity for sex hygiene none is more clearly and popularly put than that which Dr Lowry makes in his little book While the material is directed primarily against the white slave traffic the emphasis is laid on remedies rather than on conditions and the remedies suggested lie wholly within the realm of education Lutes Della T The Child Home and School Pp 307 Price 125 Cooper town N Y The Arthur H Crist Company 1911 We are a nation of extremes writes the author on the first page of her foreword and she comes close to proving her assertion by the extreme character of many of her statements Her book dealing with the child from the individual personal standpoint takes up the various phases of home and school discipline and educa tion The style is popular and rather unconvincing The book will constitute one drop in the great tidalwave of educational literature which is sweeping over the country at the present time Magruder F A Recent Administration in Virginia Pp 204 Baltimore Johns Hopkins Press 1912 This monograph described the expansion of administrative functions in the govern ment of Virginia since the adoption of its present constitution in 1902 In a fewBOOK DEPARTMENT 333 cases the administration is traced from antebellum days and the existing admin istration is frequently contrasted with that based upon the previous constitution of 1869 The main topics dealt with are The Electorate and Elections Education Charities and Corrections Public Health Agriculture Public Service Corpora tions and Finances The chapter on Education is most comprehensive and seems to have been of chief interest to the author The most striking feature of govern ment in Virginia is its conservatism The suffrage is limited by a series of tests that exclude many and there is a total absence of the newer devices of govern mentinitiative referendum recall and the likewhich find favor in some quarters The author in general is in thorough sympathy with the Virginia ideals of government as applied to the conditions in that state In the final chapter the author points out the common fault of decentraliza tion and urges further coordination among the departments and more extensive authority for the governor In addition it is suggested that heads of departments should have the right to speak before the general assembly and that the assembly should have the corresponding right of compelling heads of departments to appear before it and answer questions New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children Thirtyseventh Annual Report Pp 117 New York By the Society 1912 The Princess Travellers Tales Pp xii 296 Price

City Planning 1911 The papers presented at the Third National Conference on City Planning held in Philadelphia in May 1911 together with the discussions of the various topics which occurred have been published in book form This volume constitutes a most important addition to the fund of information upon this question The result of the first conference was published as a government document while the second conference was published through private enterprise Judged from the standpoint of the quality of the discussions their usefulness to those interested in the subject and the scope of the topics considered the third conference con tributed far more of value than either of its two predecessors Among the subjects considered in the volume are the Municipal Real Estate Policies of German and English Cities The Designing and Location of Public Buildings The Relation of Buildings to Street Widths The Water Terminal Problem Condemnation Assessments and Taxation in relation to City Planning and Problems of Street Widths Street Surface and Street Location Scott William A Money and Banking Revised Edition Pp ix 377 Price 200 New York Henry Holt  Co The changes made in this last edition which is the fourth are such as to commend themselves to the reader The description of the leading banking systems of the world has been expanded from a scant thirty pages to four times the space a distinct advantage in view of present tendencies to find in foreign countries334 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY suggestions for the improvement of our own system The addition of chapters on Credit and The Money Market are important because of the glimpse they give of the modus operandi of modem business It is to be regretted that the statistical tables in the appendices were not brought down to date Squier Lee W Old Age Dependency in the United States Pp xii 361 Price 150 New York Macmillan Company 1912 The principle of old age pensions the author maintains has been accredited universal testimony of approval in every country of its adoption hence the advocates of the old age pension principle in this country are confident that the time is opportune for pressing the campaign for its inauguration here p 338 Insurance experts believe that annuities would be of a much more effective form of insuring against old age than old age pensions and practical insurance men are constantly asking why working people do not purchase annuities The answer is not far to seek for income is in general so near a subsistence level that the average wageearner finds it practically impossible to lay by any considerable sum for a rainy day The statistics of average income do not afford much ground for hope that working people will take a general advantage of the oppor tunities available for purchasing annuities for old age Despite the pension features of labor organizations industrial establishments and transportation companies the author finds a large amount of old age dependence for which the superannuated man or woman is not responsible but which must nevertheless be borne by society or by the relatives of old people Hence some form of old age insurance seems necessary The author therefore concludes his statement with bills to provide old age pensions and to organize an old age homeguard in the United States army introduced into congress by Mr Berger of Wisconsin and Mr Wilson of Pennsylvania Although no general interest has ever been aroused in old age pensions in the United States the author has done a piece of work which should bring the matter prominently before the public since both his facts and his arguments abundantly prove his case for old age pensions Sterne S Railways in the United States Pp xiii 209 Price 135 New York G P Putnams

affairs have been awaiting the publication of a book of this character The problem with which Dr WhittenBOOK DEPARTMENT 335 deals is fundamental to the question of control over public service corporations From whatever point of view we approach the problem we are confronted with the difficult question of agreeing upon some guiding principles for the valuation of the property of the public service corporations Dr Whitten has made a pioneer effort in this field and the broad grasp that he has shown has enabled him to render a service of the first magnitude not only to students of political science but also to legislators and to all those interested in the work of the public service commissions that have been established during recent years The work takes up every phase of the question of valuation discussing very fully the problem of market values actual cost and cost of reproduction as standards of value for rate purposes The valuation of real estate and franchises is also taken up with great detail and also the manifold problems connected with depreciation In every case the author deals not only with the legal decisions but also with the economic principles involved and his work therefore repre sents something of far greater and more permanent interest than a mere survey of judicial opinions Wright W Arter The Moral Conditions and Development of the Child Pp 210 Price 75 cents New York George H Doran  Co 1911 A book for thoughtful people seeking the principles upon which moral develop ment depends The discussion of the heredity of sin in which the author places himself upon the side of modern science is a most valuable contribution He refutes the old Christian doctrine that the child is the product of sinful passion No child ever comes into the world handicapped by original sin but he admits the evident fact of physical degeneracy Sinfulness is an individual condition and a resultant of environmental forces particularly training The struggle against sin is just as strenuous and fateful now as ever The fruit of the spirit is selfcontrol now as in the time of Paul The emphasis placed upon the value of personal responsibility is gratifying in these days when we seem to have lost sight of the once eminent doctrine of the freedom of the will It is to be hoped that some of the ardent adenoid removing type of regenerators of society will read and ponder the arguments and proofs of this little book It is well to recog nize the determining influences of physical irritation malassimilation and the suggestion of unfavorable social conditions upon the immature but we should never lose sight of the fundamental principles of selfcontrol and responsibility The thought of the book is essentially theological In addition to the ex tended discussion of the heredity of sin the writer discusses the birth of the spiritual and the moral sense at what age and under what conditions the periods of spiritual development the scientific era of religious instruction the baptism of children and how can a child be saved Parents preachers and others who are looking for a scheme of moral and religious training which attempts to harmonize modern liberal religion and science will find much to satisfy them in Dr Wrights views

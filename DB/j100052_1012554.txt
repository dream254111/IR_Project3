SUPPORTING A UNIQUE THESIS THE AUTHORS THESIS IS THAT THE FUTURE COURSE AND ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE GREAT MODERN MOVEMENT TOWARD UNIVERSAL DEMOCRACY IS TO RESULT ULTIMATELY IN THE VIRTUAL DISAPPEARANCE OF FREE GOVERNMENT AND THE SUBSTITUTION OF DESPOTISM FOR FREEDOM THE WORD DESPOTISM THE AUTHOR USES NOT IN AN OPPROBRIOUS SENSE BUT AS A GENERAL TERM TO DENOTE ANY FORM OF ACCEPTED AND NECESSARY ABSOLUTISMBOOK DEPARTMENT 331 OR AUTOCRACY WITH LITTLE OR NO CONSTITUTIONAL LIMITATIONS ON THE ARBITRARY POWERS OF THE INDIVIDUAL RULER THE AUTHOR FINDS HIS CHIEF ARGUMENTS IN SUPPORT OF HIS THESIS IN THE DEPENDENT RELATION BETWEEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE FORM AND SPIRIT OF POLITICAL INSTITUTIONS HIS CONCLUSION THAT OUR REPUBLIC WILL NOT LAST LONGER THAN 1950 HE SAYS IS ONE ARRIVED AT AS A STRICTLY REASONED INDUCTION FROM THE INDISPUTABLE FACTS OF THE GENERAL ECONOMIC SOCIAL AND POLITICAL HISTORY OF NATIONS FROM THE EARLIEST TIMES DOWN TO AND INCLUDING THE CONDITIONS AND TENDENCIES OF THE PRESENT MOMENT HE DISCUSSES THE DANGERS OF DEMOCRACY AND ECONOMIC CONCENTRATION AND FINDS THAT THE INEVITABLE CONSEQUENCES OF THE CON CENTRATION OF WEALTH IS SOCIAL DEGRADATION POVERTY AND PAUPERISM THE TRANSITION FROM FREEDOM TO DESPOTISM TO A MODERNIZED CMESARISM WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGH THE DECLINING POWER AND PRESTIGE OF AMERICAN LEGISLATIVE BODIES ACCOMPANIED BY GRADUAL INCREASE IN

THE CONDITIONS STUDIED WITH THE PRESENT STATUS OF SECONDARY SCHOOLING IN THE STATE WHILE THE FIRST PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOL WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1821 IT WAS NOT UNTIL AFTER THE ENACTMENT OF THE SCHOOL LAW OF

ACTIVE LIFE IT IS INTEREST ING TO NOTE THAT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY SUCH AS MAKING THE HIGH SCHOOL THE POOR MANS COLLEGE AND THE DANGER OF COLLEGE DOMINATION WERE VITAL ISSUES THEN THE STUDY PROVIDES IN ITS OUTLINES OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DIFFERENT SUB JECTS OF THE CURRICULUM AND THE TABLES OF STUDIES WITH THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN EACH AT DIFFERENT EPOCHS A VALUABLE MEANS OF

SERVICE CORPORATIONS DR WHITTEN HAS MADE A PIONEER EFFORT IN THIS FIELD AND THE BROAD GRASP THAT HE HAS SHOWN HAS ENABLED HIM TO RENDER A SERVICE OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE NOT ONLY TO STUDENTS OF

THE AUTHOR PLACES HIMSELF UPON THE SIDE OF MODERN SCIENCE IS A MOST VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION HE REFUTES THE OLD CHRISTIAN DOCTRINE THAT THE CHILD IS THE PRODUCT OF SINFUL PASSION NO CHILD EVER COMES INTO THE WORLD HANDICAPPED BY ORIGINAL SIN BUT HE ADMITS THE EVIDENT FACT OF PHYSICAL DEGENERACY SINFULNESS IS AN INDIVIDUAL CONDITION AND A RESULTANT OF ENVIRONMENTAL FORCES PARTICULARLY TRAINING THE STRUGGLE AGAINST SIN IS JUST AS STRENUOUS AND FATEFUL NOW AS EVER THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT IS SELFCONTROL NOW AS IN THE TIME OF PAUL THE EMPHASIS PLACED UPON THE VALUE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IS GRATIFYING IN THESE DAYS WHEN WE SEEM TO HAVE LOST SIGHT OF THE ONCE EMINENT DOCTRINE OF THE FREEDOM OF THE WILL IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT SOME OF THE ARDENT ADENOID REMOVING TYPE OF REGENERATORS OF SOCIETY WILL READ AND PONDER THE ARGUMENTS AND PROOFS OF THIS LITTLE BOOK IT IS WELL TO RECOG NIZE THE DETERMINING INFLUENCES OF PHYSICAL IRRITATION MALASSIMILATION AND THE SUGGESTION OF UNFAVORABLE SOCIAL CONDITIONS UPON THE IMMATURE BUT WE SHOULD NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF SELFCONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITY THE THOUGHT OF THE BOOK IS ESSENTIALLY THEOLOGICAL IN ADDITION TO THE EX TENDED DISCUSSION OF THE HEREDITY OF SIN THE WRITER DISCUSSES THE BIRTH OF THE SPIRITUAL AND THE MORAL SENSE AT WHAT AGE AND UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS THE PERIODS OF SPIRITUAL DEVELOPMENT THE SCIENTIFIC ERA OF RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION THE BAPTISM OF CHILDREN AND HOW CAN A CHILD BE SAVED PARENTS PREACHERS AND OTHERS WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A SCHEME OF MORAL AND RELIGIOUS TRAINING WHICH ATTEMPTS TO

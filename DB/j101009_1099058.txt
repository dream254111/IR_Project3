J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1099058,DAMAGES FOR VIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCE,I245857,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER WHERE THE POSSESSION OF THE PROPERTY IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN WITH THE VENDOR VOID AS TO CREDITORS AND SUBSEQUENT PURCHASERS UNLESS 1 AS TO SUCH CONTRACTSTHEY BE IN WRITING SIGNED BY THE VENDOR AND DULY RECORDED 2 AS TO BILLS OF SALETHEY BE SIGNED BY THE VENDOR AND DULY RECORDED AS WILL BE READILY SEEN IROM THE ORIGINAL BILL IT WAS INTENDED TO REQUIRE ALL SALES AND CONTRACTS FOR SALE WHERE THE PROPERTY IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN WITH THE VENDOR FOR A GREATER PERIOD THAN TEN DAYS TO BE IN WRITING BUT THE LEGISLATURE DROPPED THE TEN DAY PROVISION AND PROVIDED THAT ANY SUCH BILL OF SALE OR CONTRACT SHALL BE IN WRITING AND SIGNED BY THE VENDOR ETC IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS PROVISION THAT EVERY BILL OF SALE SHALL BE IN WRITING WAS INTENDED TO MEAN THAT EVERY SALE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY WHERE THE POSSESSION IS ALLOWED TO REMAIN WITH THE VENDOR SHALL BE EVIDENCED BY A WRITING BUT THE COURTS WOULD SCARCELY BE JUSTIFIED IN HOLDING THAT SUCH IS ITS EFFECT IT IS TRUE THAT TO REQUIRE A BILL OF SALE TO BE IN UWRITING IS AN ABSURDITY AS A BILL OF SALE EX VI TERMINI IS IN WRITING AND THE COURTS ARE BOUND WHERE THE LANGUAGE EMPLOYED WILL ADMIT OF IT TO ESCHEW CONSTRUCTIONS WHICH LEAD TO ABSURDITY BUT THIS RULE DOES NOT GIVE THE COURTS THE RIGHT TO ALTER THE MEANING OF PLAIN WORDS IT WOULD SEEM THEREFORE THAT THE ONLY STIPULATIONS OF THE STATUTE RELATIVE TO SALES EXECUTED ARE THAT IF EVIDENCED BY BILL OF SALE SUCH BILL OF SALE SHALL BE SIGNED BY THE VENDOR AND DULY RECORDED AS TO EXECUTORY CONTRACTS I THINK AS ABOVE INDICATED THAT THE LANGUAGE EM PLOYED IS MORE FORTUNATE AND CARRIES OUT THE LEGISLATIVE INTENT IT IS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED IN MANDATORY TERMS THAT SUCH CONTRACTS SHALL BE IN WRITING AND THEY ARE DECLARED VOID AS TO CREDITORS AND SUBSEQUENT PURCHASERS UNLESS DULY RECORDED HOWELL C FEATHERSTON LYNCHBURG VA DAMAGES FOR VIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCE EDITOR VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER IN YOUR FEBRUARY NUMBER 4 VA LAW REG 702 IN A NOTE ON  DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF STATUTESVIOLATION OF CITY ORDINANCES IT IS SAID THAT IT IS AN UN SETTLED QUESTION WHETHER THE RULE THAT THE BREACH OF A STATUTE IS ACTIONABLE BY ANY PERSON INJURED THEREBY IS APPLICABLE TO THE BREACH OF A CITY ORDINANCE AND THE OPPOSING AUTHORITIES CITED IN THE NOTE FULLY SUSTAIN THIS VIEW BUT HOW IS IT IN VIRGINIA THE CASE OF DANGERFIELD V THOMPSON 33 GRATTAN 151 EVIDENTLY ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF THE ANNOTATOR THERE THE PLAINTIFF IN ERROR DANGERFIELD AND ONE HAR RISON WERE TRYING TO ENTER THE SALOON OF THE DEFENDANT IN ERROR THOMPSON IN THE CITY OF ALEXANDRIA AFTER THE LATTER HAD RETIRED D SAID TO H AS THEY STOOD AT THE FRONT DOOR FIRE A SALUTE WHEREUPON H FIRED THROUGH THE GLASS DOOR THE BALL STRIKING T WHO WAS ENTERING THE ROOM FROM THE REAR ONE OF THE COUNTS OF THOMPSONS DECLARATION SETS OUT AN ORDINANCE OF THE CITY OF A AGAINST SHOOTING WITHIN THE CORPORATE LIMITS AND ALLEGES ITS VIOLATION AS CAUSE OF ACTION AND THIS ORDINANCE IS PUT IN EVIDENCE THE COURT IN ITS OPINION AFTER STATING THE CONTENTION OF COUNSEL THAT D WAS NOT LIABLE BECAUSE HE SIMPLY ADVISED A HARMLESS ACT PROCEEDS  NOW THE FATAL DEFECT IN THIS ARGUMENT IS THAT THE FIRING OF A PISTOL IN THE STREETS OF A CITY IS NOT A HARMLESS ACT BUT ON THE CON 788 MARCH1899 CORRESPONDENCE 789 TRARY IS AN UNLAWFUL AND DANGEROUS ACT PROHIBITED AND MADE UNLAWFUL BY EXPRESS ORDINANCE IT MAY BE SUGGESTED IN EXPLANATION OF THE COURTS OPINION IN THIS CASE THAT SHOOTING IN THE STREETS OF A CITY IS PROHIBITED BY STATUTE VA CODE SEC 3361 AND IS ON THAT ACCOUNT UNLAWFUL AND ACTIONABLE THEREFORE UNDER THE GENERALLY ACCEPTED RULE AS TO BREACH OF A STATUTE ALSO UNDER SECTION 2900 OF THE CODE THE ANSWER IS THAT THE UNLAWFUL CHARACTER OF THE ACT IS REFERRED BY THE COURT EXPRESSLY TO THE ORDINANCE WHICH WAS BOTH PLEADED AND PUT IN EVIDENCE AND NOT TO THE STATUTE WHICH IT WOULD SEEM WAS IN NO WAY ADVERTED TO IT IS TRUE THE DECISION OF THE COURT IS MADE TO REST NOT ALONE ON THE VIOLATION OF THE ORDINANCE IT BEING HELD THAT D AND H WERE TRESPASSERS AND THEREFORE ENGAGED IN AN UNLAWFUL ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THE ORDINANCE IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT THE PRECISE QUESTION NOW UNDER EXAMINATION AS TO THE EFFECT OF THE BREACH OF THE ORDINANCE WAS NOT RAISED BY THE INSTRUCTIONS OF THE LOWER COURT AND SO FAR AS APPEARS WAS NOT ARGUED BY COUNSEL IN THE COURT ABOVE AND THE OPINION OF THE COURT TOUCHING THE QUESTION CAN HARDLY BE TERMED A WELLCONSIDERED ONE BUT THE EFFECT OF THE DECISION I RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT IS TO PLACE VIRGINIA WITH THOSE STATES WHICH HOLD THE VIOLATION OF A PENAL CITY ORDINANCE TO BE ACTIONABLE PER SE FOR PROXIMATE INJURY 0 D BATCHELOR NEWPORT NEWS VA WIFES CONTRACTUAL POWERS EDITOR VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER PERMIT ME TO CALL THE ATTENTION OF THE PROFESSION TO A CASE DECIDED IN THE LAW AND EQUITY COURT OF THIS CITY DURING THE PAST TERM IN WHICH THE QUESTION OF A WIFES CONTRACTUAL POWERS WAS AT ISSUEA QUESTION WHICH IS PERHAPS OPEN TO THE ATTENTION OF ALL LAWYERS AND ONE IN WHICH THE REGISTER HAS SHOWN MUCH INTEREST THE FACTS OF THE CASE BRIEFLY STATED ARE AS FOLLOWS MY CLIENT THE PLAINTIFF BROUGHT AN ACTION OF DEBT AGAINST A HUSBAND AND WIFE ON A NEGOTIABLE NOTE FOR 500 OF WHICH THE WIFE WAS THE MAKER AND THE HUSBAND THE INDORSER THE NOTE BEARING DATE IN 1894 THE HUSBAND WAS TOTALLY INSOLVENT THE WIFE HAD NO APPRECIABLE STATUTORY SEPARATE ESTATE BUT OWNED CONSIDERABLE EQUITABLE SEPARATE ESTATE THE DECLARATION WAS AN ORDINARY DECLARATION IN DEBT ALLEGING THAT THE WIFE WAS POSSESSED OF SEPARATE ESTATE AT THE TIME THE NOTE WAS MADE AND WAS DEMURRED TO ON TWO GROUNDS FIRST THAT IT OMITTED TO ALLEGE THAT THE WIFE WAS POSSESSED OF STATUTORY SEPARATE ESTATE AND SECOND THAT AS THE WIFE DID NOT OWN SUCH ESTATE THIS SUIT COULD NOT BE MAINTAINED AT LAW THE CASE WAS OBSTINATELY FOUGHT AND BRIEFS BEING FILED BY COUNSEL ON BOTH SIDES THE MATURE OPINION OF THE COURT IS WORTHY OF CONSIDERATION ON THE FIRST POINT IT WAS ARGUED THAT DUVAL V CHELF 92 VA HAD NO BEARING INASMUCH AS IT WAS A DECISION UNDER THE SMITH ACT AND NOT UNDER THE CODE 1887 THAT UNDER THE SMITH ACT A WIFE COULD CONTRACT ONLY TO THE AMOUNT OF HER SEPARATE ESTATE WHILE UNDER THE CODE OF 1887 SHE CAN CONTRACT TO ANY AMOUNT ON THIS POINT IT WAS FURTHER ARGUED THAT SEC 3245 PROVIDES THAT ALLEGATIONS WHICH ARE NOT TRAVERSABLE NEED NOT BE ALLEGED AND INASMUCH AS THE WIFE COULD NOT DENY THE OWNERSHIP OF SEPARATE ESTATE THIS ALLEGATION IS NOT TRAVERSABLE AND NEED NOT BE ALLEGED AND THE COURT SO HELD

with the lagellanic Gold Medal by an award of the Society in Decemnber 1790 IT is an acknowledged fad that when the fhrouds of a veffel are braced very tight fo as to prevent the mails from having any play or fpring he will not fail as faft as when her mafls are permitted to bend a lit tle to the impulfes of the wind The reafon is that the wind is feldom uniform in its force for any length of time and it is impoffible that a fudden encreafe of impulfe Ihould injiantaneouJfy communicate a proportionable velocity to fo heavy a body placed in a refifting medium of fo great denfity In fuch cafe the veffel is forcibly preffed into or againif the water and is obliged to heel from the blaft until a progreffive motion adequate to the force impreffed can be communicated to the whole mafs But thefe fudden preffures againft the water and this heeling of the veffel are great obflacles to fafl failing in as much as they oc Tt 2 cafion332 DESCRIPTION OF A SPRINGBLOCK cafion an unprofitable

with more fecurity The mafts yards and rigging of a thip receive the firft impulfes of the wind All thefe are in forne degree elaflic Every twifled rope is a fpiral fpring and every 1zar capa ble of

the wind in heeling and flipping to leeward If this is true her failing muft be confiderably afliffed by any means that fhall encreafe the afaive fpring of hler rig ging For this purpofe 1 have contrived what I call a SPRINGBLOCK to be applied to all fuch parts of the rig ging as will admit of it with fafety and convenienice and wh2re its operation will be moft advantageous but par ticularly to the Iheetropes and if praaicable to the dead eyes in lieu of what are called the chains Defc iption A fig I Is a block made in the ufual manner having a ring or eye 13 at one end C is a fpiral fpring linkecd at one end to the hiook D E and at the other to the ring F which is to be annexcd by a flaple to the timberhead or by fone other means to the place where it is to be applied The fpring C muff be of well tempered Reel and proportioned in ftrength to the fervice it is to per form WVitlhin the cavity or pipe formed by the fpiral fpring there muft be a chain of a fuitable flrength called a checkchain reprefented feperate at C conneaed by lirksk to the rings D and F When the fpiing is not in aaion this chain is flack but when the fpiral fpring is extended by the force of the wind as far as it can be without danger of injury the cheekchaini muft then begin to bear to prevent its further extenfion and if flrong enough will be an effeatual fecurity againti failure Fig 2 reprefents part of the gunwale of a foop with the fpringblocks in aafion one ofthem hooked to a flaple in the timberhead and the other to the corner of the jib My expefaation is thata vetTel thus furnifhed will be lefs liable to heel that fhe will receive the impulfes of the wind to better advantage and fail with a more lively and equ4ble motion than if rigged in the common way Yires acquiret

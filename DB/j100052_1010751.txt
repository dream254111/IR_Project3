J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1010751,TARIFF REVISION AND PROTECTION FOR AMERICAN LABOR,I242593,TARIFF REVISION AND PROTECTION FOR AMERICAN LABOR BY JOHN R COMMONS AM PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN MADISON WIS FOR NEARLY SEVENTY YEARS THE EFFECTIVE ARGUMENTS THAT HAVE SUSTAINED THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF HAVE BEEN THE HOME MARKET FOR FARMERS AND A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING FOR WAGE EARNERS THE FIRST DEPENDS ON THE SECOND FOR WITHOUT A PURCHASING POWER OF AMERI CAN LABOR GREATER THAN THAT OF FOREIGN LABOR THE HOME MARKET IS NOT MUCH BETTER THAN THE FOREIGN MARKET THE STANDARD OF LIVING IS THE REALLY ENDURING JUSTIFICATION OF THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF THE TARIFF PREVENTS THE COMPETITION OF FOREIGN LOWSTANDARD LABOR AND DRAWS A CHARMED CIRCLE WITHIN WHICH AMERICAN LABOR MAY GRADUALLY WORK OUT ITS OWN HIGHER STANDARDS NOW IT IS AN IMPORTANT FACT THAT THE PRINCIPAL LEADERS AND ADVOCATES WHO FRAMED THE PAUPER LABOR ARGUMENT TWO OR THREE GENERATIONS AGO AND WHO WON ITS ACCEPTANCE BY THE COUNTRY DID NOT BELIEVE THAT THE TARIFF ALONE WOULD BRING ABOUT A HIGH STANDARD OF LIVING THEY LOOKED UPON THE TARIFF MERELY AS DEFENSIVE IT NEEDED TO BE SUPPLEMENTED BY POSITIVE EFFORTS BY VOLUNTARY ORGANIZATIONS BY LEGISLATION WITHIN THIS COUNTRY IN FACT THE TARIFF WAS TO THEM SIMPLY THE MEANS BY WHICH THESE DOMESTIC EFFORTS COULD BE GUARAN TEED A FREE FIELD FOR SUCCESSFUL EXPERIMENT AND ADOPTION MATTHEW CAREY FROM I820 TO I840 DID MORE THAN ANY OTHER AMERICAN TO ESTABLISH THE TARIFF ON A PROTECTIVE BASIS IN THE INTERESTS OF LABOR HIS INDEFATIGABLE INVESTIGATIONS FURNISHED THE ARGUMENTS FOR PETI TIONS WHICH MANUFACTURERS SENT TO CONGRESS FOR REPORTS OF CON GRESSIONAL COMMITTEES FOR SPEECHES OF CONGRESSMEN AND HE MORE THAN ANY ONE ELSE CHANGED THE TARIFF ARGUMENT FROM PROTECTION TO CAPITAL TO PROTECTION TO LABOR YET MATTHEW CAREY ALTHOUGH AN EMPLOYER WAS PROMINENT IN THE LABOR AGITATION OF THE THIRTIES AND IN HIS SUPPORT OF THE LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OF THAT PERIOD HE AIDED AND DEFENDED THEIR STRIKES AND BROUGHT DOWN UPON HIMSELF THE BLOWS OF THE FREETRADE ORGANS WHICH RIGHTLY IDENTIFIED HIS PROTECTIONISM WITH HIS TRADEUNIONISM 315THE ANNALS OF THE ALMERICAN ACADEMY FOLLOWING HIM CAME HORACE GREELEY WHO DID FOR THE PEOPLE WHAT CAREY HAD DONE FOR THE POLITICIANS HE CONVERTED THEM TO PROTECTION BY THE HOMEMARKET AND THE STANDARDOFLIVING ARGUMENTS YET THERE WAS NO MAN OF NATIONAL FAME IN HIS DAY WHO DID AS MUCH EFFECTIVE WORK FOR TRADEUNIONISM AND EVEN SOCIALISM AS HORACE GREELEY HE PRESIDED OVER INDUSTRIAL CONGRESSES TO WHICH DELE GATES CAME FROM THE LABOR UNIONS THE LAND REFORMERS FROM THE FOURIERITE AND OTHER SOCIALISTIC SOCIETIES HE OPENED THE TRIBUNE TO THESE RADICALS AND AVOWED HIMSELF FOR SOCIALISM AT THE TIME WHEN HE WAS ALSO POWERFULLY SUPPORTING PROTECTION INDEED HE CLAIMED THAT PROTECTION WAS NECESSARY TO ENABLE SOCIALISM TO WORK ITSELF OUT TO A SUCCESSFUL ISSUE FREE FROM THE DESTRUCTIVE COMPETITION OF PAUPER LABOR WHEN WE COME TO THE PERIOD AFTER THE WAR CONGRESSMAN KELLEY OF PENNSYLVANIA SO PERSISTENT AND ABLE A CHAMPION OF PROTECTION AS TO BE KNOWN TO THE NATION AS PIGIRON KELLEY OFTEN ASSERTED AS I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY HIS DAUGHTER MRS FLORENCE KELLEY THAT THE WORK OF HIS GENERATION MUST BE TO ESTABLISH AMERICAN INDUS TRY THE WORK OF THE NEXT GENERATION WOULD BE TO DIFFUSE ITS BENEFITS IT IS THIS HOPE OF CONGRESSMAN KELLEY WHICH I BELIEVE POINTS TOWARD THE DUTY OF THE PRESENT DAY IN THE REVISION OF THE TARIFF THE SOCIALISM OF HORACE GREELEY HAS LONG SINCE BEEN PROVED VISION ARY THE TRADEUNIONISM OF CAREY AND GREELEY HAS BEEN PROVED INEFFECTIVE IN THE VERY INDUSTRIES WHERE THE TARIFF IS MOST PROTECTIVE IN GREELEY AND KELLEYS TIME THE IRON AND STEEL INDUSTRY SEEMED TO BE FIRMLY ESTABLISHED ON A SYSTEM OF JOINT TRADE AGREEMENTS OF CAPITAL AND LABOR BUT SINCE THE HOMESTEAD STRIKE THE ONCE POWER FUL TRADE UNION OF THAT INDUSTRY HAS DWINDLED TO A REMNANT THE HOURS OF LABOR FOR MEN ON SHIFTS HAVE BEEN INCREASED ALMOST UNI FORMLY TO TWELVE PER DAY NIGHT WORK AND SUNDAY WORK HAVE BEEN EXTENDED WHEREVER POSSIBLE TWENTYFOUR HOURS CONSECUTIVE WORK ON ALTERNATE SUNDAYS IN ORDER TO CHANGE THE NIGHT AND DAY SHIFTS HAS BECOME NECESSARY FOR MANY EMPLOYEES WHILE SPEEDING UP TO THE LIMIT OF ENDURANCE AND CUTTING PIECE RATES WITH INCREASE OF SPEED HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO A SCIENCE THE GLASS INDUSTRY TOO IS MARKED BY THE DECLINE OF UNIONISM IN CERTAIN BRANCHES AND EVEN WITH UNIONISM IT IS NOTORIOUS FOR THE EXPLOITATION OF CHILD LABOR IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY CHILD AND WOMAN LABOR LONG HOURS AND INTERSTATE COMPE TITION HAVE DEFIED THE LOUDEST AGITATION AND HAVE KEPT THE WAGES 3I6 52TARIFF REVISION AND PROTECTION FOR LABOR AND CONDITIONS AT A POINT ACTUALLY INFERIOR IN PLACES TO THOSE OF ITS FREETRADE COMPETITOR ENGLAND IN OTHER PROTECTED INDUSTRIES UNIONISM IS MAKING A RETREATING FIGHT AND I DO NOT SEE HOW IT IS POSSIBLE IN THOSE WHICH HAVE REACHED THE STAGE OF A TRUST FOR UNION ISM TO RECOVER ITS GROUND LABOR CANNOT CONCENTRATE AS CAPITAL DOES IT IS AMONG THE INDUSTRIES AND LABORERS NOT DIRECTLY PROTECTED BY THE TARIFF LIKE THE BUILDING TRADES THE RAILROADS THE LONGSHOREMEN OF THE LAKES THAT UNIONISM HAS ITS PRINCIPAL STRENGTH IN ALL INDUSTRIES ITS INFLUENCE IS PARTIAL AND THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THE WORKERS ARE OUTSIDE ITS RANKS IF THEIR STANDARDS OF LIVING ARE TO IMPROVE UNDER THE PROTECTING SHIELD OF THE TARIFF THE IMPROVEMENT MUST COME THROUGH THE AID OF LEGISLATION WE NEED SCARCELY STOP TO MAINTAIN THE FUTILITY OF STATE LEGISLA TION IN PROTECTING LABOR IN THE TARIFFPROTECTED INDUSTRIES IF THE INDUSTRY IS COMPETITIVE THE MORE ADVANCED STATES LIKE MASSACHU SETTS CANNOT AFFORD TO HANDICAP TOO GREATLY THEIR OWN MANUFACTURERS IF THE INDUSTRY IS TRUSTIFIED THE TRUST CAN SHUT DOWN ITS FACTORIES IN AN ADVANCED STATE AND THROW ITS ORDERS TO ITS FACTORIES IN A BACK WARD STATE LIKE PENNSYLVANIA THE TACTICS THAT DEFEAT UNIONISM ARE THOSE THAT DEFEAT STATE LEGISLATION AS REGARDS FEDERAL LEGISLATION THERE ARE SERIOUS QUESTIONS OF CONSTITUTIONALITY AND INTERFERENCE WITH STATE PREROGATIVES THESE HAVE COME TO THE FRONT IN THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWED THE BEVERIDGE CHILD LABOR BILL AND IN THE DECISION OF THE NATIONAL CHILD LABOR COMMITTEE TO WITHDRAW FROM THAT LINE OF ATTACK IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER SUCH LEGISLATION CAN BE BROUGHT IN UNDER THE SUBTERFUGE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE OR EVEN UNDER THE GENERAL WELFARE CLAUSE BUT MORE TO THE POINT IS THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT BASED ON THE REAL CONSIDERATION WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OFFERS TO EMPLOYERS OF LABOR AS COMPENSATION FOR THE EXPENSE WHICH LABOR LEGISLATION IM POSES THIS IS THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF IN THIS FIELD QUESTIONS OF CON STITUTIONALITY HAVE ALREADY BEEN SETTLED CONGRESS MAY IMPOSE A TARIFF FOR PROTECTION AS WELL AS REVENUE IT MAY SELECT THE INDUSTRIES AND ARTICLES TO BE TAXED AND DETERMINE THE RATE OF IMPORT DUTY CONGRESS IS ALSO SUPREME IN THE MATTER OF INTERNAL REVENUE TAXES IT MAY IMPOSE SUCH TAXES FOR REGULATION AS WELL AS REVENUE IT COUPLED THE NATIONAL BANK ACT WITH A PROHIBITIVE TAX OF IO PER CENT ON STATE BANK NOTES IT HAS PLACED A HEAVY TAX ON COLORED OLEO MARGARINE IN COMPETITION WITH DAIRY BUTTER IN THE FIELD OF CUSTOMS 317 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY AND INTERNAL REVENUE TAXATION CONGRESS IS SUPREME IN ITS ACTION NO POWER OF SUPERVISION OR CONTROL IS LODGED IN EITHER OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS OF THE GOVERNMENT WITH THIS UNQUESTIONED CONTROL OF THE TAXING POWER THE TARIFF CAN BE MADE TO PASS OVER A SHARE OF ITS BENEFITS TO THE WAGE EARNERS FOR WHOM IT IS INTENDED THE METHOD IS MERELY A QUESTION OF THE TECHNICAL DRAFTING OF THE LAW AND NOT ANY INNOVATION ON THE PRINCIPLES OF LEGISLATION NOR INFRING MENT ON CONSTITUTIONAL BOUNDARIES A FEASIBLE METHOD HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY THE NEW COMMON WEALTH OF AUSTRALIA IN THE TAXATION OF AGRICULTURAL MACHINERY THE SOCALLED EXCISE TARIFF OF I9O6 WAS ADOPTED ON THE SAME DAY AS THE CUSTOMS TARIFF THE CUSTOMS TARIFF ACT IMPOSES A SCHEDULE OF DUTIES ON IMPORTED GOODS AND THE EXCISE LAW I E INTERNAL REV ENUE IMPOSES A SCHEDULE OF ONEHALF THOSE RATES ON THE SAME GOODS WHEN MANUFACTURED AT HOME BUT IT IS PROVIDED THAT IN CERTAIN CASES THE EXCISE DUTY SHALL NOT APPLY THESE ARE ESTABLISHMENTS WHERE THE CONDITIONS AS TO THE REMUNERATION OF LABOR IN THE MANU FACTURE OF THE HOME PRODUCT A ARE DECLARED BY RESOLUTION BY BOTH HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT TO BE FAIR AND REASONABLE B ARE IN ACCORD ANCE WITH AN ARBITRATION AWARD OR C A TRADE AGREEMENT OF EMPLOY ERS AND TRADE UNION AS PROVIDED IN THE CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ACT OF 1904 OR D ARE DECLARED FAIR AND REASONABLE AFTER A HEARING BY A JUDGE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF A STATE OR HIS REFEREE THE ADMINISTRATIVE DETAILS ARE OF COURSE UNESSENTIAL THE ESSENTIAL FEATURE OF THE AUSTRALIAN ARRANGEMENT IS AN INTERNAL REVENUE DUTY AT A LOWER RATE THAN THE CUSTOMS DUTY ON THE COMPETING ARTICLE AND THE REMISSION OF THAT DUTY IF THE HOME MANUFACTURER ON WHOM IS THE BURDEN OF PROOF CAN SHOW THAT HIS EMPLOYEES ACTUALLY RECEIVE THE BENEFITS INTENDED BY THE PROTECTIVE TARIFF I DO NOT OVERLOOK THE FACT THAT A POLICY OF THIS KIND REQUIRES ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY AND SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION BUT THIS SHOULD BE REQUIRED UNDER ANY KIND OF TARIFF REVISION SURELY THE TARIFF SHOULD NOT BE REVISED OR REDUCED EXCEPT ON THE BASIS OF COST OF PRODUCTION IN THIS COUNTRY AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES THIS SHOULD INCLUDE FIRST OF ALL THE COMPARATIVE COST OF LABOR I BELIEVE ALL TARIFF REVISIONISTS AGREE TO THIS IN ORDER THAT THE TARIFF MAY BE RETAINED AMPLE ENOUGH TO COVER THE HIGHER COSTS OF LABOR IN THIS COUNTRY BUT THERE IS A MENACE IMMINENT EVEN IN SUCH AN INVESTIGA 17 WALL 433 195 U 8 57 318 54TARIFF REVISION AND PROTECTION FOR LABOR TION AT THE PRESENT TIME BECAUSE IT ASSUMES THAT REVISION WILL BE MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE EXISTING LONG HOURS LOW WAGES AND CHILD AND WOMAN LABOR OF MANY PROTECTED INDUSTRIES THE ACTUAL COST OF LABOR IS LOWER THAN IT WOULD BE IF THE HOURS WAGES AND CONDI TIONS WERE FAIR AND REASONABLE THE PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY WILL GLADLY SUPPORT A TARIFF HIGH ENOUGH TO PAY NOT MERELY THE EXISTING WAGES BUT BETTER AND EVEN IDEAL WAGES THEY DO NOT ASK THAT THE TARIFF BE REDUCED TO THE PRESENT LABOR COST IN SOME CASES LIKE PIG IRON THAT COST IS PROBABLY LESS THAN IT IS IN ENGLAND BUT IN ENG LAND THE BLAST FURNACE WORKERS ARE ON THE EIGHTHOUR DAY WHILE HERE THEIR DAY IS TWELVE HOURS SEVEN DAYS A WEEK THE PEOPLE WILLINGLY PROTECT LABOR BUT THEY WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE TARIFF ACTUALLY PASSED ALONG TO THE WAGE EARNER IF THEREFORE A TARIFF COMMISSION INVES TIGATES THE COMPARATIVE COST OF LABOR IN THIS AND COMPETING COUNTRIES IT SHOULD INQUIRE WHETHER THE WAGES AND HOURS ARE ACTUALLY REASON ABLE AND WHAT WOULD BE THE COST IF THEY WERE MADE REASONABLE IT IS ON THIS IDEAL BASIS AND NOT THE ACTUAL BASIS THAT THE TARIFF SHOULD BE REVISED IF THIS IS DONE THEN THE ONLY SERIOUS DIFFICULTY OF THE PLAN THAT OF INVESTIGATION IS ALREADY PROVIDED FOR SUCH A TARIFF COMMISSION WOULD NECESSARILY BE A PERMANENT ONE AND NATURALLY IT WOULD BE A BUREAU OF THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE AND LABOR A PERMANENT BUREAU OF THIS KIND WOULD RECEIVE GENERAL INSTRUC TIONS FROM CONGRESS AS TO WHAT FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A REASONABLE AMERICAN STANDARD OF LIFE SHOULD BE THE CONDITION OF LABOR THIS MIGHT PROVIDE FOR ALL WORKERS AT LEAST FIFTYTWO FULL DAYS OF REST EACH YEAR IT MIGHT PROVIDE THAT ALL CONTINUOUS OPERATIONS SHOULD BE DIVIDED INTO THREE SHIFTS OF EIGHT HOURS INSTEAD OF TWO SHIFTS OF TWELVE HOURS IT MIGHT PROVIDE THE EIGHTHOUR DAY IN NONCONTINU OUS OPERATIONS FOR WOMEN WORKERS AND POSSIBLY FOR MEN IT MIGHT SET THE MINIMUM AGE OF CHILD LABOR AT FOURTEEN OTHER PRO VISIONS SUCH AS MINIMUM RATE OF PAY MIGHT BE MORE GENERAL AND BE LEFT TO THE COMMISSION UNDER GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IS REASONABLE UNDER THE CONDITIONS IF UPON INVESTIGATION AND INSPECTION THE BUREAU OR COMMISSION FINDS THAT A GIVEN MANU FACTURER IS GRANTING TO HIS EMPLOYEES THESE REASONABLE CONDITIONS A CERTIFICATE TO THAT EFFECT WOULD BE THE WARRANT OF THE INTERNAL REVE NUE COMMISSIONER TO REMIT THE INTERNAL REVENUE TAX ALL THE MACHINERY FOR IMPOSING SUCH A DISCRIMINATING TAX IS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE OLEOMARGARINE TAX WHICH 319 55THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IMPOSES A TAX OF TEN CENTS PER POUND ON ARTIFICIALLY COLORED OLEO MARGARINE AND ONEFOURTH OF ONE CENT PER POUND ON UNCOLORED OLEOMARGARINE THIS TAX AND ITS ADMINISTRATIVE MACHINERY HAVE BEEN SUSTAINED BY THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES AS BEING NOT IN CONTRAVENTION OF THE CONSTITUTION2 THE ONLY ADDITIONAL MACHINERY REQUIRED IS THAT WHICH IS ALREADY WIDELY PROPOSED IN THE FORM OF A PERMANENT TARIFF COMMISSION SUCH A COMMISSION I BELIEVE IS FAVORED BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS AND THEIR BILL ONLY NEEDS THE ADDITION OF A CLAUSE GIVING THE COM MISSION POWER TO ISSUE AND REVOKE THESE CERTIFICATES OF CHARACTER IN ORDER TO MAKE IT AN EFFECTIVE INSTRUMENT OF LABOR PROTECTION THIS WOULD OF COURSE REQUIRE A FORCE OF INSPECTORS OR AGENTS AND CON SIDERABLE EXPENSE BUT THE EXPENSE WOULD BE MET BY THE ADDED REVENUE 2MCCRAY V U S 195 U S 27 320 56

THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF PRIORITY IN ZOOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE THE keystone of all nomenclature of species and genera is the rigid and exceptionless ap plication of the law of priority without it no uniformity could be attained There is practically complete agreement on this point among all who have had considerable experi ence in the definition of genera and species that is among those who best understand the difficulties of reaching ultimate agreement Now the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature has adopted the following Art 25 The valid name of a genus or species can be only that name under which it was first designated on the condition a Thati this name was published and accom panied by an indication or a definition or a description and b That the author has applied the principles of binary nomenclature It is clear that the ruling of clause a allows too much laxity and is too indefinite The amendment that has probably occurred to others and that I would urge as most necessary is the change of clause a to read as follows That this name was published accompanied by a published recognizable description or by a pub lished recognizable drawing Publication is to be understood as meaning expression in print and  recognizable a de seription or drawing sufficiently accurate and detailed for distinguishing the species or genus named from any other species or genus known at the time when fhe name was ap plied A few considerations among many may be mentioned to justify this amendment In the first place as the code rules at present it is only necessary for a systematist to publish a name in accordance with the other rules of binary nomenclature and to give an  indication indicating e g a par ticular type specimen in a particular collec tion he is really not obliged to give any de scription whatsoever or he may give an in different or even an inaccurate description provided he makes this indication In time this loophole will lead to the utmost con fusion it would be impossible to get any idea of a newly named species without resource to the type specimen This is the main reason for eliminating from the clause in question the vague and meaningless word  indication  vague and meaningless unless it signifies the indication of a particular specimen Surely it is not the spirit of scientific nomen clature to point to a specimen as an idea In the second place it is becoming more and more necessary that the name should be accompanied by a recognizable description or drawing There are many of the most modern systematists as well as large numbers of the earlier ones whose diagnoses are worthless for purposes of positive identification These diagnoses either do not mention the important characteristics or do not describe them fully or accurately enough or else do not draw comparisons with the closely allied forms If there is one thing we want to get out of the description of a new species it is the item of how it differs from the known forms of the same group Such descriptions are a posi tive hindrance to systematic progress they may even arrest it entirely They are scien tifically valueless they vilify the journals con taining them Under the present code one must have resource to the type specimen Suppose then I am monographing a particular group and find in the literature some papers in which the descriptions are practically meaningless then I must ask for the loan of the specimens but they may be in a museum the rules of which forbid the loaning of types then I must in person visit that museum to find perhaps that the specimens have been mutilated beyond recall or have even been lost Or should I wish to undertake the re vision of the species of a comprehensive genus say Epeira or BuTimulus then I should have to undertake a Weltreise for which my finances would probably be inadequate and visit practically every museum in the world Then everyone knows how type specimens suf fer from handling how perishable the average dried or alcoholic specimen is The mere statement that a type specimen exists in such a collection is not the spread of a scientific20 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 6G53 knowledge Suppose a man should undertake a review of the present status of the problems of evolution would we not expect that he would at least describe the various theories Would it not be ridiculous for the reviewer to give simply a list of books and papers and indicate in what libraries these are to be found Science can make no advance when nothing but names are given or only un recognizable descriptions with the indication where specimens are to be found The reten tion of a type specimen is always desirable for future reference butthe publication of a good description is the sine qua non of scientific advance Those who take the pains to furnish ade quate descriptions and who draw comparisons with the previously known species will always be regarded as the original describers whether the rules of nomenclature give them credit or not The suggestion of demanding a recognizable description is of course open to the objection that it is difficult to decide what constitutes a recognizable diagnosis The decision must be made separately for each particular case All would concur in the fairness of the prin ciple to consider the adequateness of the de scription at the time when it was made A description would be recognizable if at the time it was published it served to demarcate the species from all the other then known species of the genus or the genus from all the other then known genera of the family Questions of this kind can generally be de cided by any monographic reviser of a group As the case stands at present there is all incentive for hasty and insufficient diagnoses at least our codes do not prevent them We have either to hunt up the type specimen to spend fruitless hours to try to read some meaning into a description or to try by the unsafe method of elimination to deter mine what species an author intended As the A 0 U Code of 1886 put it  Zoological nomenclature is a means not an end of zoological science it ought to make the path clear and not maintain obstacles Too much of a premium is placed upon age there is too strong a tendency to resurrect the oldest name and try to fit to some particular species whether it was accompanied by a good diagnosis or not So long as this continues so long will the names in use be unstable Personally I never have and never will re gard a name as tenable unless it is based on a recognizable description or drawing and that whether type specimens are preserved or not There are many who share this view and in this connection attention may be drawn to the very cogent recent arguments of Looss1 We are all in sympathy with the endeavors of the International Committee most of us realize the difficulty of the ques tions it has to decide and we are ready to relinquish personal views in order to reach uniformity But there will never be uni formity of opinion in regard to the matter of allowing a name to be based simply upon an indication New names are multiply ing in a geometrical ratio some of then newly coined and others raked out of the ash heap of describers who deserve oblivion few genera have been thoroughly revised if maere  indications  and inadequate descriptions continue to be permitted the task of revision will before long be hopeless Then there will be need for far more radical reform than the one here suggested Now while our rules are still plastic let us insist on the absolute neces sity of adequate diagnoses of genera and species Thus insecurity may be abolished each describer be given his just due and no more and science as well as nomenclature be benefited One recommendation the committee might embody in the code to clarify future system atic work though of course it could not be applied to the work of the past That is that when structural characteristics enter into a diagnosis they should be represented so far as possible by drawings rather than by words A drawing is immediately clear few descrip tions are Above all it is often very difficult to build a conception of a structure from a brief Latin description since the Latin is too poor in adjectives for our present needs De scribers are too intent upon their own conveni ence give too little attention to tbe con I Zoologischer Anzeiger 1907 Nr 19JULY 5 1907 SCIENCE 21 venience of those who have to read their descriptions This recommendation will be of great aid in identifying species and genera and will help towards that end when men will see there is honor in furnishing good diag noses but no honor in simply naming species THOS II MONTGOMERY JR THE

15 1900 Harrison J 1 STATUTESLocalGeneralRepeal of one by another The passage of a local statute expressly applicable to only one county of the State in no way repeals supersedes or affects an existing general law in the same words as the local law except that it is applicable to all the counties of the State 2 FENCESCommon law rule Virginia rule No fence law The rule of the common law which requires the owner of animals to keep them on his own land or within enclosures is not in force in this State except in those counties where the board of supervisors have adopted the no fence law as provided by sec 2048 of the Code The owner of animals is under no obligation to restrain them and is not liable for damage done by them in consequence of straying on the un enclosed lands of another Without a lawful fence the land owner can maintain no action for such damages The common law rule is contrary to the public policy of this state as manifested by legislation from the earliest period until the present time 3 CONSTITUTIONAL LAwFences A fence law which requires a land owner to enclose his land by a lawful fence as a prerequisite to the right to recover for damages done by trespassing animals violates no right of the land owner granted to him by the Constitution of the State or of the United States 4 FENCE LAWWilful trespassDamages Although the fence law of this State does not require the owner of cattle to restrain them from passing of their own accord upon the unenclosed lands of another it gives such owner no authority to drive them there and if he does he is

fraud of a grantor or transferer of property is not sufficient of itself to avoid an assignment or transfer thereof where value has been paid but it must also be proved that the grantee or transferee had notice of the fraud or evil design of his vendor or of facts and circumstances naturally calculated to excite suspicion in the mind of a person of ordinary care and prudence and which would naturally prompt him to enquire before consummating the purchase and that such enquiry if diligently pursued would have led to the knowledge or notice sought to be im puted 2 PLEDGESFraudNotice to pledgee Pledges for value without notice are entitled to the same protection as other bona fide purchasers and though notice may be inferred from circumstances as well as proved by direct evidence yet the proof must be such as to affect the conscience of the pledgee and must be so strong and clear as to fix upon him the imputation of bad faith 3 PLEDGESFraudNotice to pledgee Usurious interest The mere fact that the apparent owner of property is willing to borrow money on it at a usurious rate of interest even if it were evidence of the insolvency of the borrower does not charge the lender with the duty of enquiring whether the borrower had paid for 341342 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept the property It only imposes upon the lender such enquiry as is suggested by the facts which are known or disclosed in the transaction There must be such con nection between the facts known or disclosed and those to be discovered upon en quiry that the former may be said to furnish a clue to the latter The lender is not required to enquire into the motives and purposes of the borrower in procuring the loan without the knowledge of other facts to put him upon such enquiry In the absence of any lien or notice of defective title the usurious lender is not required to enquire into the source of the borrowers title 4 TRUSTEEsBona fide purchaserFraudBurden of proof The trustees in a deed of trust to secure money are purchasers for value and the burden of proving knowledge of fraud on the part of the grantor in the deed is on the party alleging it 5 CHANCERY PLEADING AND PRACTICEBill charging fraudFailure to answer If a bill contains definite specific and express charges of facts constituting fraud on the part of the grantee in a deed of trust and he fails to answer it the bill should be taken for confessed and the deed be set aside 6 TRUSTS AND TRUSTEESDescription of property A deed of trust which con veys certain designated pianos and also  all pianos organs and all other merchan

BREEDING HABITS OF THE SPECIES C H TURNER Even casual observers visiting the suburbs of Augusta Ga are sure to notice this ant not merely because of its large size but on account of its conspicuous mounds which are scattered in open places on all the vacant highlands A somewhat dry sandy soil seems best suited for its development for although the mounds are numerous on the divide both along the road side and in open patches in the woods yet they are practically absent from the low damp floodplain The conspicuousness of each mound is not due to its height for each is only a few inches high but to its large barren surface Some of the mounds are as much as five feet in diameter and many have a major axis of three feet The area of the mound seems to be a function of the size of the colony I say size rather than age of the colony because an old but weak colony will often have a smaller mound than a much younger colony that has a large population This condition of affairs is due to the habit of occa sionally abandoning its old mound and excavating a new one If the migration occurs when the colony is small even though it is old the area of the mound will be small In small mounds the shape is often subcircular but in larger mounds the shape departs much from that of a circle Figs I8 This mound is composed partly of materials excavated in forming and enlarging the burrows and partly of small pebbles and other coarse ma terials collected from the surrounding surface of the ground All sizes of workers participate in making the mound The number of openings into the nest varies from one to sev eral This is true not only of different nests but of the same nest at different times If an opening to a nest is closed with small particles by some agency foreign to the nest the ants that may be on the outside at the time act for a time as though theyC H TURNER were confused then they begin to remove the obstruction In the meanwhile the ants in the nest have been tunneling from within Usually the ants from within are the first to penetrate the obstruction Occasionally the ants on the outside are the first to make a breach In one case observed by me the ants on the outside took no part whatever in removing the obstruc tion until the ants in the nest had made an opening When the nest opening is closed with anything which is not too large for several ants acting conjointly to remove several will cooperate in removing it otherwise a new opening is made I have seen as many as five ants acting conjointly in removing an obstruction x ya b FIG I FIG 2 FIG I

outside of the nest I fill the opening with sand and small pebbles Immediatly the workers on the outside of the nest examine the obstruction and then rush about as though they are searching for an opening 502 P M Several workers try to force an opening through the obstruction 510 P M  One of the workers confined to the nest succeeds in forcing a passageway to the outside Im mediately three workers begin to remove the pebbles Up until now no particle has been removed from the outside of the nest 5I 5 P M  Another worker emerges from within 520 P M  The opening has been cleared and the ants are busy bringing I62THE MOUND OF POGONOMYRMEX BADIUS LATRL from the nest the pebbles that the ants working from within the nest had carried inward from the obstruction Whether a nest contains several openings or only one early in the morning and at night the openings are found to be closed In the spring and early summer I have often found all of the nest openings closed as late as 750 A M Careful observations extending over a period of five months demonstrated that the nest opening or openings are regularly closed by the ants at the close of day The time required to complete the closing and the number of ants employed varies in different nests and in the same nest at different times but the method in all cases is so similar that the following description of the behavior of the ants on one occasion will serve as a type of all It was eighteen minutes to seven July 20 I908 and darkness was fast approaching Four workers were busy covering the nest opening with plant debris sand and pebbles Part of the time they would stand balanced upon the two posterior pairs of legs with their heads turned away from the nest and kick the sand backwards with their fore feet and part of the time they would carry coarser materials and place them upon the nest By twentythree minutes after seven the opening was almost closed and the ants passed inside In a few minutes two workers returned to the outside and continued the closing of the opening Soon they were joined by a third worker By forty minutes after seven the opening was closed then the three workers wedged themselves inward through the closed entrance Soon a worker returned to the outside and added more material to the pile over the nest opening Then it forced its way into the nest This behavior was repeated several times The nest was finally closed from within By eight oclock everything was quiet On one occasion I noticed this ant make use of this hole closing instinct to rid itself of the encroachments of another ant A species of Atta had constructed a burrow within the confines of a mound of a colony of Pogonomyrmex badius When I first discovered these conditions a single worker of the latter species was busy covering the opening of the burrow of Atta with sand The sand was driven into the opening by the ant standing on its four hind legs and kicking the sand backward with its fore feet I63C H TURNER The larger particles were carried in the mouth and deposited therein Every few moments the ant would enter the burrow and compact the sand with its head Frequently it would leave the hole and wander about for a few moments It always soon returned to the covering After the hole had been filled to the level of the ground the ant continued to pile on sand When I left at Ioo3 A M the ant was still piling on sand At no time was it assisted by any other ant although numerous ants passed by it With few exceptions on each mound there is one or more trash piles In over two hundred mounds examined I noticed only one FIG 3 FIG 4 FIG 3 Mound of P badius a entrances The mound is covered with peb bles and dead stalks of grass and weeds are scattered over it Greatest length 32 in

but in most cases it does not seem to bear any definite relation to that opening Figs 2 4 6 It seems selfevident that a mound as conspicuous as this must play some important role in either the present or the past behavior of the species It is possible that it serves more than one pur I64THE MOUND OF POGONOMYRMEX BADIUS LATRL pose however several months careful study has convinced me that one of the most important functions of this mound is to serve as a device to promote sexual union The following description of the behavior of this species during the process of mating will make this point clear Mating takes place at intervals during the warm weather How often this occurs and whether the intervals are regular or irregular I am not prepared to say I observed the inmates of one set of nests mate on June 8 and again on June I6 and on several other occasions I saw what looked like signs of recent mating Practically all the nests of the same locality mate at the same time On one mating occasion out of eleven nests occurring within a radius of a few yards the inmates of eight were going through the mating behavior The three colonies that were not mating were small and weak During the daylight hours a few workers usually promenade on top of the mound just before a mating is to occur this number is increased many fold To a casual observer it looks as though the majority of the inmates of the nest were out for a sun bath All move about in a nervous manner A few males and a few unfertilized winged females repeatedly emerge from the nest move about for a few moments and then retire After this has continued for a time the males fly away and the females promenade among the restless workers When the males arrive at another mound they alight and move about in a jerky nervous manner among the restless workers and females on the mound If in its zigzag rushing the male comes in contact with one or more workers these neuters attack it at once Some times a male attempts to enter the nest It is at once opposed by the workers I have never seen a male succeed in entering the nest but I think they do sometimes for on more than one occasion I have seen workers dragging males out of the nest When a male comes in contact with a winged female he mounts her back and attaches his reproductive organs to the tip of her abdomen She either remains quiet or else gently nibbles the abdomen of the male with her jaws After a few minutes of intimate contact the ants separate each to repeat the act with some other ant This coition always occurs either on the ground or on a blade of grass or a low weed never in the air I65C H TURNER That the same female accepts the attentions of several males and that the same male serves several females I have established by experiments conducted as follows A number of males captured as soon as they alighted on the mound were confined by means of cotton plugs in a small testtube In a second testtube was placed a single female Into this second tube a single male was introduced As soon as the pair had separated after coition that male was removed and a fresh male introduced This was repeated until the female refused to mate A dozen experiments of this sort were conducted The greatest number of males a FIG 5 FIG 6 FIG 5 Mound of P badizs surface view a entrances b debris mostly plant matter from the nest There is a

34 in accepted by the same female was four the least number was two After the last successful coition the introduced male always tried to copulate but in vain On the mound on several dif ferent occasions I have seen the same female copulate with two different males In another series of a dozen experiments several females were removed from the top of the mound and confined in a cotton stoppered testtube In another tube was confined a male that had just arrived at the mound One of the females was intro r66THE MOUND OF POGONOMYRMEX BADIUS LATRL duced into the tube with the male They copulated immediately As soon as coition was over the female was removed and a fresh female introduced This was repeated until the male would no longer mate The greatest number of females served by the same male was five the least four After the last successful coition when a fresh female was added the male would attempt to copulate but in vain These experiments show conclusively that the same female may mate with several different males and that the same male may serve several females As to the number of services that either may give or accept these experiments do not give a final a FIc 7

39 in answer for there was no way of being sure that the female cap tured on the nest had not previously been served nor could I be absolutely certain that the male had not visited some other mound and copulated before arriving at the nest From the above description it seems evident that the mound of this species is a device for promoting crossfertilization The large conspicuous expanse of barren land in the midst of vege tation serves as a stimulus to attract the flying male Whether this is to be regarded as a tropism or an ordinary reflex is more than the experiments answer That it is an instinctive response is selfevident i67C H TURNER There is a widespread belief that the male ant always dies within a few hours after copulation The following two experi ments show that in this species the male may live for several days after mating June 8 1908  Five males captured just after copulation are confined to a Janet nest June 10 All are alive June I  Two are dead and three living

June i6 I908  Fifteen males captured just after copulation are confined in a Janet nest June 17 All are alive June 18 All are alive June I9 One is dead one is dying and thirteen are alive This series was interrupted by a forced ab sence from the laboratory In each of the above cases no male died until at least two days had elapsed after copulation and in each case some of the males lived for several days Females captured immediately after copulation and confined in a Janet nest often did not shed their wings until at least two days had elapsed This is not in harmony with the belief that all female ants shed their wings on the evening of the day on which copulation occurs I68THE MOUND OF POGONOMYRMEX BADIUS LATRL CONCLUSIONS I At the mating time the females of Pogonomynrmex badius and the numerous workers roam about on their home mound but the males fly away 2 The broad barren mound situated in the midst of vegeta tion arrests the males in their flight and thus promotes cross fertilization 3 Mating occurs on the ground or on a blade of grass or on a small low weed but never on the wing This usually happens on the mound but sometimes it occurs in the adjacent grass 4 The same female may be impregnated by several males and the same male may serve several females 5 The male does not die until several days after mating 6 The nest openings are closed by the ants at the close of every day SUMMER HIGH SCHOOL ST LOUIS MO April 9 1909 I69

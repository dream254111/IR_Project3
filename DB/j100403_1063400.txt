pended from practice by the court until the sum be paid it was held that this was a remedy for the creditor and did not prevent proceeding for the disbarment of the attorney Commonwealth v Roe 129 Ky 650 112 S W 683 Again where a statute provided that no fine or forfei ture should be enforced after six months from the time of incurring it and an attorney guilty of misconduct sought to interpose this statute in bar of disbarment proceedings it was held that the statute had no application to disbarment proceedings State v Walker 141 La 464 75 South 207 The present case is undoubtedly correct on reason and principle and is supported by authority for though the payment by the attorney of the money wrongfully retained releases him from civil liability it does not free him from blame for having committed the offense nor does it rehabilitate him as a proper person to practice law In re Da vies supra BANKRUPTCYFRAUDULENT TRANSFER OF PROPERTYSUMMARY PROCEED INGSAn insolvent formed a corporation with near relatives as in corporators and nominal stockholders for the purpose of withdrawing his property from the reach of his creditors In the bankruptcy pro ceedings which followed the trustee by summary order from the ref eree seized the property and it was sought to bar the discharge of the bankrupt for his fraud The right of the referee to enter such an order was denied on the ground that the corporation was an adverse claim ant Held such a corporation is only a colorable holder for the in solvent and summary proceedings will lie but discharge will not be barred because there was no actual transfer of property Liller Bldg Co v Reynolds C C A 247 Fed 90 It is settled that one who claims the right to the possession of prop erty received from the bankrupt prior to his adjudication whose claim is not merely fictitious or colorable is an adverse claimant in posses sion and his right to possession cannot be tried in a summary pro ceeding In re N Y Car Wheel Works 13M Fed 203 In re Kane 131 Fed 386 In re Teschmacher 127 Fed 728 But where the goods are held by a person who is in reality the bankrupt in disguise the bank ruptcy court may take them into its custody by summary proceedings In re Franklin Suit and Skirt Co 197 Fed 591 28 Am B R 278 And the bankruptcy court has power to decide whether the claim is in fact well founded or whether it is fictitious In re Norris 177 Fed 598 24 Am B R 444 In re Rathman C C A 183 Fed 913 25 Am B R 246 But it is impossible to declare a general rule which will determine in every case whether a person claiming a right or interest against the trustee is an adverse claimant COLLIER BANKRUPTCY 10 ed p 477 That a corporation is a legal entity apart from the natural persons who compose it is a mere fiction of law but like every other fiction it may be disregarded when urged to an extent and purpose not within its reason and policy State v Standard Oil Co 49 Ohio St 137 30 N E 279 15 L R A 145 34 Am St Rep 541 Bank v Trebein Co 59 Ohio St 316 52 N E 834 In re Rieger 157 Fed 609 Thus where it 536RECENT DECISIONS is shown that a bankrupt while insolvent has organized a corporation with his relatives to which he has conveyed all of his property and which is conducted solely for his benefit for the purpose of placing such property beyond the reach of creditors his trustee may be prop erly ordered to seize such property summarily In re Berkowitz 173 Fed 1013 In re Rieger supra The principal case seems clearly sound on this point But the conclusion drawn by the court that since the transaction was not effective to transfer the property beyond the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court to seize by summary proceedings the bankrupt could not be denied a discharge under  14 b clause 4 of the Bank ruptcy Act seems unsound The above section seems to be broad enough to bar a discharge not only where there is a successful trans fer but also where the fraudulent transfer fails And this is the view taken by the better authority In re Bullwinkle 111 Fed 364 In re Hogy C C A 220 Fed 665 Thus where an insolvent debtor who owned a number of stores organized a corporation in which he held practi cally all the stock and transferred to the corporation the more profita ble stores in order to break the leases on the unprofitable stores he was denied a discharge in bankruptcy since the conveyance would hinder delay and defraud his creditors in obtaining the property In re Braus 237 Fed 139 CARRIERSINJURIES TO PASSENGERSFREIGHT ELVATORSThe plaintiff while delivering packages to tenants in an office building used the freight elevator the defective operation of which by the defendants servant caused the plaintiff to be thrown down and his leg crushed be tween elevator platform and ceiling The plaintiff brought this action for the injury sustained Held the plaintiff cannot recover ORourke v Woodward Ala 77 South 679 A proprietor of a passenger elevator is a carrier of passengers and is subject to the same responsibility as to care and diligence as are carriers of passengers Treadwell v Whittier 80 Cal 574 22 Pac 266 5 L R A 498 13 Am St Rep 175 But as to the responsibility of the owner of a freight elevator to passengers rightly thereon the cases are not so clear although many of the more recent decisions regard the situation as analogous to that of a stockman or other passenger riding on a freight train This analogy is expressly stated to exist in Orcutt v Century Bldg Co 201 Mo 424 8 L R A N S 929 But the owner of a freight elevator by inviting another to ride thereon does not make it a passenger elevator nor owe him the same degree of care owed by owners of passenger elevators Hall v Murdock 114 Mich 233 72 N W 150 Where it is a custom of tenants to accompany freight on elevators operated in a building an injury resulting from the break ing of the elevator makes the owner liable Springer v Ford 189 Ill 430 59 N E 953 52 L R A 930 82 Am St Rep 464 But it is a question for the jury whether due care has been exercised where the person accompanying freight was killed by falling into an opening be tween the elevator and the wall Gray v Seigel Cooper Co 187 N Y 376 80 N E 201 And the same is true where the freight had already 537

attenuated form requiring the minimum heat to produce the maximum of light The principle of the invention will be understood when it is described as a hood or mantle of finely divided but perfectly coherent refractory oxides of lanthanum zirconium and yttrium round the flame of a Bunsen burner The lamp has given satisfactory results so far  We learn from the Engineering and Mining Journal that the Alliance Aluminium Company has been formed in London England with a capital of 500000 for the purpose of manufac turing aluminium sodium and potassium The company owns the English German French and Belgian patents of Professor Netto for the reduction of aluminium from its compounds and for the manufacture of sodium and potassium the processes of Mr Cunningham for the reduction of the above metals a process for the manufacture of artificial cryolite by the regeneration of its slags provisionally protected by the inventor Mr Forster Lonesome Chemical Works Streatham a process invented by Professor Netto and Dr Saloman of Essen Germany by which this metal can be raised to the highest standards of purity on a commercial scale Exhaustive experiments have been made at the works of Krupp at Essen to test the practical value of the processes and it is stated that he has the means of making the metal in tons In stead of beads or marbles solid chunks of the purest aluminium known weighing from five pounds to one hundred pounds accord ing to the size of the converter are deposited at every fusion of the ingredients chief among which are sodium and cryolite The company has a contract with the owners of the cryolitemines in Greenland to supply it with practically the entire output It is stated that the patents of the company enable it to manufacture it at considerably less than one shilling per pound An interesting fact in the history of the movement for indus trial training in the public schools of Washington is its connection with Cooper Union that unique institution of which New York is so justly proud As already stated in Sczience industrial drawing including moulding in clay and construction in cardboard etc has long been a feature of the Washington schools The supervisor of drawing Mrs S E W Fuller who for fifteen years has guided the work was trained in the Cooper Union in those early days when with an enthusiasm and thoroughness not excelled by later institu tions and a wise prevision of coming demands it brought art and industry into their proper relation as means and purposes of educa tion LETTERS TO THE EDITOR  Corresfiondents are requested to

describing a peculiar form of northern lights particularly so as it was my fortune to witness a similar phenom enon in I881 On July 2 of that year the day on which President Garfield was shot at about 920 in the evening faint streaks of light were observed on the northern horizon I then observed a streak of cloudlike light ascending at about the eastsoutheast horizon Looking around I saw a similar streak at an opposite point In a short time these streaks blended into one in the zenith forming an arch overhead There was a bend or crook in this arch just at what point I do not remember as I made no note of it but I think at or near the middle Presently the streak began to grow narrower then it changed and broadened again until it be dcame wider than it was at first then the southern edge resolved itself into parallel bars at right angles with the arch shortly after the northern edge resolved itself into similar bars which moved rapidly towards the west presently the bars at the southern edge of the arch either vanished or blended with the others and they all glided swiftly by towards the west the bars gradually became fewer and fewer until they could be seen only here and there VOL XI No 281 gliding along and at last the whole arch faded entirely away During all this time the lights in the north had been shining and when I retired for the night they were still to be seen I have copied this description from notes which I took at the time I have seen other interesting auroras but never have seen the arch overhead since FRANCIS H ALLEN West Roxbury Mass  June 13 Concerning the Montville Serpentine THE statement made by your correspondent in your issue of June I5 regarding work done by me on the Montville NJ serpentine induces me to add a few additional particulars on the subject This I am the more inclined to do since the paper giving the full results of my work is as yet unpublished but is awaiting its turn in the Government PrintingOffice The origin of serpentinous rocks by a process of metasomatosis from the various members of the pyroxene group is a matter by no means new to petrographers in general and has been noted by Dana in the limestonebeds of Westchester County NY as well as by Emmons and Cross in those of the Leadville region None of the cases however can compare in point of beauty with that at Montville Here in a coarsely crystalline highly magnesian limestone were originally embedded numerous large and small spheroidal and lenticular masses of a gray or pure white mono clinic pyroxene approaching diopside in composition These through a process of metasomatosis commencing on the outer surface have become converted wholly or in part into a very pure though highly hydrated translucent green and light amberyellow serpentine In the process of quarrying the limestone for flux these nodules are thrown out and from the quarry dump have been gathered samples showing most beautifully every stage of the change from that in which the serpentine exists as merely a thin coating to that in which all traces of the diopside have disappeared and a solid block of compact serpentine alone remains The nodules vary in size from the fraction of an inch to two or more feet in diameter I have as yet however never seen blocks of the serpentine more than six or eight inches in greatest diameter The process of change must have been exceedingly slow and gradual as the line of demarcation is very sharp so sharp indeed that at first glance such an origin as I have attributed appears impossible On ex posure to the weather the serpentinous coating undergoes a shrinkage and breaks away from the unchanged nodule almost as clean as the burr from a chestnut Nodules in the museum col lections which have been freed from their serpentinous coating have the appearance of some easily soluble substance like lime stone that has been suspended freely in a dilute acid until all its angles and irregularities of surface have disappeared In my paper which is shortly to appear in the Proceedings of the United States National Museum are plates showing the nodules and the transition stages from diopside to serpentine as shown in thin sections under the microscope I have gone into consider able detail in my description not merely on account of the beauty of the resultant serpentine but because this is an unusually fine illustration of the process of metasomatosis The beautifully slickensided surfaces and other indications of the expansive force generated during the process are also very suggestive The readiness with which samples can be procured which show in a single small specimen all stages from perfectly fresh and un changed diopside to beautiful compact serpentine makes the material particularly valuable to teachers The small size of the serpentine blocks obtainable together with the invariably fractured condition of the mineral renders it of practically no importance as an ornamental stone GEORGE P MERRILL US Nat Mus Washington June I6 Queries 33 DIPHTHERIA CARRIED BY TURKEYS  Referring to the paragraph  Diphtheria carried by Turkeys in Science for May I i I beg to

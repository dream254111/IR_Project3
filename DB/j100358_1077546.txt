amnuwent CHANGE IN SUBSCRIPTION PRICE The School Review has maintained its original subscription price of 150 from the beginning of its history This price is now to be changed to 250 Renewals and new subscriptions received from this date will be at the new rate Elaborate explanation of the change in price is hardly necessary One item will illustrate the situation Less than two years ago the business manager called attention to the fact that the blank paper in a single copy of the School Review cost five cents For the last issues this figure has been very nearly eight cents The School Review is published monthly from September to June by the University of Chicago It is edited and managed by the Department of Education as one of a series of educational publica tions The series including also the Elementary School Journal and the Supplementary Educational Monographs is under a joint editorial committee and covers the entire field of educational interests JOINT EDITORIAL

that the change in price will not diminish the cir culation of the School Review During the last year the circulation increased 30 per cent It is the purpose of the editors to maintain the quality of the School Review and to show a like increase during the year to come THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION The March 1920 meeting of the North Central Association has been reported in part to readers of the School Review in two articles one by Professor Davis in the April issue and one by President Hughes in this issue One matter of business which came before the association is worth adding because it indicates the steady progress of the move ment toward cooperative standardization for which this associa tion has stood from the date of its organization A request was received from the Northwest Association of Secondary and Higher Schools for recognition of the lists of ap proved institutions prepared at the meetings of this new association which are to be held annually at Spokane in conjunction with the Inland Empire Teachers Association The new association includes at the present time Oregon Washington Idaho and Montana It has been adopting standards and preparing lists of approved high schools during the last four years This year it is to take up the problem of an approved list of colleges The standards adopted are like those of the North Central Association The older association voted to send a delegate to the Spokane meeting and there will doubtless follow a mutual acceptance of approved lists The advantages which arise from the development of such a separate organization are those which come with intimate dis cussion by relatively small groups of inspectors of the problems which belong to their special territory Such intimate conferences can be held from year to year with the confident expectation that there will be a full representation of the states involved The territory of the North Central Association has become so great that it is not easy for the states remote from the place of meeting to send delegates regularly The relation thus established between the North Central Association and the new association in the west parallels in purpose1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 323 and form the relation which has existed for some years past between the North Central Association and the Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools of the Southern States Here again common standards and an interchange of delegates have made it possible to unify methods of approval and of standardization It remains for the southwestern states a number of which are now in the North Central Association to complete the organization with California and Nevada and the whole territory west of the Alleghany Mountains will be on a basis of accrediting high schools and colleges which is nearly uniform There is some indication also that the New England Associa tion will be reconstructed along lines similar to those followed by the western and central associations It may be possible in the not distant future to organize by representation from these regional associations a central body which will represent as no other body has higher education for the whole country REORGANIZED MATHEMATICS It is a source of great satisfaction to those of our colleagues who have been teaching combination mathematics in the Univer sity High School of the University of Chicago to note the progress which is being made toward the general adoption of what has been done in this institution for some time The frank imitation of Mr Breslichs books by recent publications is the highest possible compliment to the work which he has patiently carried on for years Indeed one is led to offer the comment that the imitation exhibited in certain recent texts would have been in somewhat better form if it had been even franker The latest indication that there will be a general landslide very shortly toward this type of mathematics appears in the report of the National Committee on Mathematical Requirements This report does not refer the reader explicitly to Mr Breslichs articles written when he encountered the bitterest opposition of the con servatives in the early days of his publication But then the committee is not especially concerned with history and it is no part of its present problem to recanvass Professor Moores presi dential address before the Mathematical Association of America and Professor Myers subsequent discussions which inaugurated this movement The committee is very properly concerned solely324 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May with the remaking of the antiquated and outworn highschool course in mathematics In this effort it ought to have the heartiest cooperation of all progressive workers in the highschool field In the spirit of unqualified approval of the recommendations now made we devote space to a few quotations and are glad also to say to highschool teachers that if they want to find these recommenda tions in full operation after a number of years of antecedent trial they should consult Mr Breslich and his publications or visit the classes in his department The report from which the following quotations are extracted is published by the Bureau of Education as Secondary School Cir cular No 5 It is recognized that in the earlier periods of instruction the strictly logical organization of subjectmatter is of less importance than the acquisition on the part of the pupil of experience as to facts and methods of attack on significant problems of the power to see relations and of training in accurate thinking in terms of such relations Care must be taken however through the dominance of the course by certain general ideas that it does not become a collection of isolated and unrelated details Continued emphasis throughout the course must be placed on the develop ment of power in applying ideas processes and principles to concrete problems rather than to the acquisition of mere facility or skill in manipulation The excessive emphasis now commonly placed on manipulation is one of the main obstacles to intelligent progress On the side of algebra the ability to understand its language and to use it intelligently the ability to analyze a problem to formu late it mathematically and to interpret the result must be dominant aims Drill in algebraic manipulation should be limited to those processes and to the degree of complexity required for a thorough understanding of principles and for probable applications either in common life or in subsequent mathematics It must be con ceived throughout as a means to an end not as an end in itself Within these limits skill in algebraic manipulation is important and drill in this subject should be extended far enough to enable students to carry out the fundamentally essential processes accurately and expeditiously On the side of geometry it is felt that the work in formal demonstrative geometry must be preceded by a reasonable amount of informal work of an intui tive experimental and constructive character Such work is of great value in itself it is needed also to provide the necessary familiarity with geometric ideas forms and relations on the basis of which alone intelligent appreciation of formal demonstrative work is feasible Most if not all of the material suggested in this report is of sufficient impor tance for every educated person to warrant making it a requirement for all pupils In view of the fact that large numbers of students either because they leave school or because the further study in mathematics is not required in the1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 325 school they are attending do not study mathematics beyond the ninth grade it is felt that the first years work should make the student acquainted with as broad a foundation of mathematical training as is consistent with sound scholar ship In particular the course should contain both algebra and geometry with at least an indication of the nature of a geometric demonstration It is therefore suggested that in the first year ninth grade about twothirds of the time be devoted to the most useful parts of algebra the numerical topics of intuitional geometry and the beginnings of trigonometry and about onethird of the time to geometry including both the necessary informal introduction if this has not been provided for in earlier grades and the first part of demonstrative geometry The second years program would then cover further work in algebra demon strative geometry and trigonometry If the student has had a satisfactory course in intuitional geometry before the ninth grade he may find it possible to cover a minimum course in demonstrative geometry giving the great basal theorems and constructions together with exercises fairly well in the ninety periods constituting a half years work If he had not had such earlier instruction a full year should probably be devoted to geometry both informal and demon strative which may however as indicated be divided between the ninth and tenth grades Additional courses should be offered in the third and fourth years of the secondary school to enable students who so desire to continue their study of mathematics AMERICAN COUNCIL ON EDUCATION There is a new educational organization which promises to be of importance in unifying the educational interests of the country It grew out of the emergency council which was called together by the institutions of higher education when the United States went into the war The purpose and general character of the American Council on Education are set forth by Mr Capen its director in an editorial which he publishes in the first issue of the Educational Record The Educational Record devotes twentysix pages to a summary of the educational bills now before Congress and gives the remainder of the issue to a description of the council The editorial is in part as follows The American Council on Education is the central organization in which the great national educational associations are represented Its general object is to promote and carry out cooperative action in matters of common interest to the associations and to the institutions composing them It has three classes of members constituent associate and institutional The constituent members are sixteen national educational associations Each is represented by three delegates who vote as a unit at meetings of the council through a designated person Associate members are educational or scientific organizations having interests related to the work of the council Associate members may send one326 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May representative each to the meetings of the council without right to vote Institu tional members are colleges universities professional and technical schools contributing not less than 100 a year to the treasury of the council Each may be represented by one delegate at meetings of the council without right to vote The officers of the council are elected annually Its headquarters are in Washington at 818 Connecticut Avenue They are in charge of a director with assistants Each of the councils major projects is in charge of a standing committee The following are the undertakings in which progress has already been made or which have been authorized by the Executive Committee 1 Federal legislationIt is of the first importance that the educational interests of the country should be instructed as to the existence and purport of proposed federal legislation affecting education The councils office has digested the seventy odd educational bills now before Congress A classified summary of the more important of them appears in this issue of the Educational Record It will be followed in later issues by critical analyses and discussion of the principles involved in the more farreaching legislative measures This undertaking is in charge of a standing Committee on Federal Legislation 2 International educational relationsDuring the past eighteen months some eight or nine different agencies have entered the field of international edu cation to the confusion both of foreign educational officers and of the educational interests of the United States The council has succeeded in bringing about a working agreement between a number of these bodies so that duplication may be avoided and the situation made clear to foreigners It hopes to effect a still greater consolidation of these activities in the near future Probably in view of the large number of bodies now operating in this field the council will not itself take a very prominent part in the promotion of international exchanges of pro fessors and students It has agreed however to be responsible for an effort to bring about a uniform treatment by American universities of foreign degree holders It has also agreed to interpret to foreign educational officials existing lists of approved institutions It will of course participate in the entertainment of any official foreign delegation of scholars These matters are in charge of a standing Committee on International Educational Relations 3 Education for citizenshipThe council has a standing Committee on Education for Citizenship including military training The committee proposes to study and report on education for citizenship in higher institutions and teacher training agencies with particular reference to questions of military training It expects also to review the work of various committees on education for citizenship which have been appointed by other educational associations and to make a final report which will combine the basic principles and recommendations upon which all agree 4 Training of women for public serviceA standing Committee on the Training of Women for Public Service is the successor of a committee which functioned effectively during the war Its plans are not yet completed Its purpose is however to study the possible openings for highlytrained women in the public service the qualifications required and the kind of academic training best adapted to meet the various needs1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 327 5 The college of liberal artsThe executive committee has authorized the appointment of a standing Committee on the Status and Problems of the College of Arts and Sciences The committee has not yet been appointed but it is assumed that it will make a comprehensive study of the present relations of the college of arts and sciences to the university and professional schools to the vocational schools on the same academic level such as schools of commerce journalism and engineering to the junior college etc It will also undoubtedly consider the fundamental aims of colleges of liberal arts with a view to formulating a definition of this type of institution appropriate to the present time 6 StandardizationThe council also proposes to bring about a greater uniformity of procedure among the principal agencies now engaged in defining college standards To this end the executive committee of the council has authorized the appointment of a committee which shall be composed of repre sentatives of the principal standardizing bodies The council also has a standing Committee on Cooperating Societies and a Finance Committee The sixteen institutional members of the council are as follows 1 Association of American Universities 2 National Association of State Universities 3 Association of American Colleges 4 Association of Urban Universities 5 Catholic Educational Association 6 Association of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations 7 Society for the Promotion of Engineering Education 8 Association of American Law Schools 9 Association of American Medical Colleges 10 National Research Council 11 American Association of University Professors 12 Association of Collegiate Alumnae 13 National Education Association 14 NEADepartment of Superintendence 15 National Council of Normal School Presidents and Principals 16 Council on Medical Education of the American Medical Association CURRENT SCIENCE MATERIAL The Popular Science Monthly issues each month service sheets for teachers of science and manual arts in which a brief summary is given of the articles in this journal which can be employed as cur rent science material for highschool classes We are very glad to call attention to these service sheets and to indicate the usefulness of this kind of summary of magazine material for the schools The statement made by the editor of the service sheets with regard to the purpose and methods of employing this material is as follows328 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May The purpose of these service sheets is to arouse new interest in the classroom work by showing the pupils how closely the facts they learn from the textbook and laboratory are connected with the practical things of life Even the teacher will keep his enthusiasm at topnotch by being abreast of the times in his knowledge of the new and improved ideas in electricity wireless automobiles airplanes manual training machinery biology and in fact every thing that is happening in the world of science The heavyface headings should first be examined for articles applying to topics to be studied during the current month A schedule should be prepared of the timely articles so that assignments of topics may be made to different pupils for reading and report It is suggested that a halfhour or more be used each week to discuss the new ideas on some one subject such as electricity or automobiles that appears in the current issue of the Popular Science Monthly Encourage the pupils to keep a notebook with their writeup of the various ideas found in the Popular Science Monthly illustrated by the pictures cut from the magazine After assignments for the current month have been selected the items on the service sheets should be cut apart and pasted on library cards After the month has passed articles that may be used in reviews or with later classes should be filed topically They are already indexed for filing Very short articles may be themselves pasted on cards As the file grows it will be found a valuable storehouse of practical applications ANNUAL MEETING OF THE N E A The following statement regarding the summer meeting of the National Education Association is issued by the secretary The next annual meeting of the National Education Association will be held at Salt Lake City Utah July 410 inclusive The program is nearing comple tion and will be printed in the next issue of the N E A Bulletin A feature of the program will be the Congress of Boards of Education on Thursday July 8 forenoon afternoon and evening Theme Financing and Managing the Public Schools Members of school boards state city and county superintendents and educational experts will take part in the discussions The congress will meet in two sections on Thursday forenoon one section to consider ruralschool problems and the other to consider the financial problems of the city school It will meet in one body Thursday afternoon and Thursday evening Several eminent men and women have accepted places on the program The following are among the subjects of addresses and symposiums on the general program The Survival of the Professional Spirit Despite Economic Pressure and Social Unrest The Recognition of Education as Related to Our National Life The Necessity of the Unity of the Profession in Obtaining Needed Legislation The Proper Relation of the Superintendent and Board of Education to the Teaching Body with Respect to Administration1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 329 The Proper Relation of the Classroom Teacher to the Superintendent and Board of Education with Respect to Administration The Relation of Teacher Shortage to Educational Standards Legal Status of the City Superintendents of Schools Fiscal Independence of City Boards of Education Shortage of Teachers in Rural Communities a National Calamity The Extension of Education in Country Life The Council of State Superintendents will hold an important two days conference preceding the general sessions The National Council will hold its sessions on Monday July 5 Sunday July 4 will be designated on the program as Musical Sunday The program of patriotic music under the auspices of the teachers and musical associa tions of Salt Lake City and the State of Utah means that Musical Sunday will be one of the great days of the convention All general sessions will be held in the worldrenowned Tabernacle of the Mormon Church The preparation of the program for this great meeting is in the hands of the president of the association Mrs Josephine Corliss Preston who not only takes into account in the program the actual needs of the hour but looks ahead to shape readjustments and tendencies for the future welfare of our schools SUMMER SCHOOLS The output of the Institute for Public Service is sent to the School Review and is read along with the other items that go to make up the editors task of keeping abreast of all sorts and kinds of opinion Most of this output passes without exciting any desire to print it The following picture of a royal road to learning can hardly be omitted however without injustice to the great throng of teachers and other school officers who summer after summer submit themselves to the operations of academic treadmills The author of this diatribe seems to have been unfortunate in his acquaintances judging from the remarks to which he listens A new kind of summer school for teachers is suggested by the Institute for Public Service in a recent bulletin At this school there will be no recitations no lectures no textbooks no library assignments no class texts In place of the regular routine are substituted hikes swimming tennis golf dancing round table conferences private talks about individual problems and opportunities for frank discussion with educators of proven ability Are teacherstudents satisfied with the present type of summer schools To what extent is school work improved by attendance or do teachers attend in order to secure by attendance an increased salary better position another degree or certificate Those in charge of summer schools have no right to sacri fice education for academic credit Too many teachers are being passed through the same mill irrespective of ability training or physical condition Teachers below par physically ought to be excluded from book work Others who think330 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May only shop should be refused shop courses Able teachers should not spend six weeks learning the XYZ method written by someone who has never put the method in use under actual working conditions The aims and methods of summer schools need revision get away from the academic treadmill more discussion less lectures more individual development less textbooks more specific problems less generalization When a principal or teacher after a summerschool attendance says as many do I cant think of one thing that I have done that will specifically benefit my school work next year then it is time for directors to remove the dud courses The objection of course to a summer school whose final test is color added weight gained or lost vitality developed independent thinking fostered is that it wont work unless academic credit is given However if teachers will tell frankly their needs superintendents boards of education higher institutions will soon begin to recognize growth from selfdevelopment and courses in outing conferencehealth schools RELIGIOUS EDUCATION Religious education is developing rapidly for good or ill through unceasing propaganda In view of this condition the Council of the Religious Education Association at its annual meeting in Pittsburgh March 1921 adopted as the general theme for the meeting The Formation of Public Opinion The subject was discussed from the point of view of Sources and Objects of Propa ganda the Technique of Propaganda and the Psychology of Opinion Forming Reports were submitted on the Press and Advertising Publicity Men Public Speaking Campaigns and Drives Motion Pictures Higher Education and other phases Other sessions were devoted to the discussion of related themes considered from the point of view of special fields The section of Bible Teachers in Colleges discussed The Best Methods of Teaching Biblical Subjects How Shall We Relate Biblical Teaching to Other Subjects in the College Professional Stand ards in Biblical Teaching Organization and Administration of Courses in Religious Education The Curriculum and the College Department of Religious Education and Religious Educational Values of NonCurricula Courses Important papers among them one on Sex Education in the Seminary Course were discussed before the department of Theo logical Seminaries As usual the department of Christian Associations presented an afternoons program discussing Community Agencies Working with Girls and Women and Community Agencies Working with Boys and Men1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 331 Perhaps the subject which chiefly interested those who are studying the problem of the religious education of children was the discussion of plans for initiating and conducting systems of week day instruction in religion To those who are engaged in secular education this is a very important matter for it must necessarily involve a certain amount of cooperation on the part of public and private secondary schools Reports of outstanding experiments are not as yet such as to satisfy fully the ideals of religious education for which the best leaders in this field stand nor are any plans which have been proposed for carrying out the work wholly satisfactory to the day schools It is clear that something is coming in the way of the correlation of religious education with general education and that a program must be prepared which will satisfy the neces sity for the exclusion from the public schools of anything which can be termed sectarian even by those who disapprove of it The tendency seems to be to place upon the churches a heavy educa tional responsibility for which they are not well prepared The indications are however that they are becoming aware of this and that through many instrumentalities they are seeking counsel in relation to methods and material and that the contributions of thinking men and women in the field of education are earnestly desired Not the least important of the sessions of the convention was that of the Department of Educational Directors in Local Churches membership in which requires technical preparation of a high degree Papers were presented on Training in Citizenship The InterChurch Survey of Religious Education Next Steps in a National Program of Religious Education and Possibilities of CityWide Religious Education The Religious Education Association numbers three or four thousand in its membership and publishes all papers given at its convention in its official organ Religious Education GEORGIA L CHAMBERLIN UNMVERSrrY OF CHICAGO ETHICS IN HUGHES TEXTBOOK ON CIVICS I have read with very great interest the April number of the School Review especially the reports presented at the Cleveland meeting Anything concerning the subjects of these reports can not fail to command my interest and I must confess an added332 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May stimulus to such interest because of the mention in one report and analysis in the other of my Community Civics Without wishing to say anything that will in the least degree be considered a complaint against the statements made in the report read by Dr Judd and based upon an analysis of certain textbooks made by Mr Brooks I should be glad to have the privilege of stating a question raised in my mind by this analysis as far as it concerns Community Civics Mr Brooks says All discussions that develop standards of conduct have been classed as Ethics regardless of the source of such discussions Then when he analyzes Community Civics he finds every one of his categories represented except ethics Now I should be greatly disappointed if anyone from this analysis or any other source should get the impression that the book is entirely a collection of facts and statistics It is true that no chapter is given a title that directly suggests ethics but several sections at least seem to me to be more ethics than anything else and to come distinctly within Mr Brooks definition of the term I realize however that there may be room for an honest difference of opinion on this point and am not disposed to quarrel over it I do wish to make clear lest anyone should get an impression to the contrary that I strongly believe that the study of the social sciences should by all means result in the setting up of sound and strong ethical standards I hoped that sound ethical principles might be inculcated all the way through Community Civics It is often better I think to get the ethics in incidentally than to do a great deal of dogmatic preaching but I surely intended that the ethics should be in the book even though it may be camouflaged A prominent Pittsburgh teacher recently expressed to me a sense of surprise that two books intended distinctly for the study of vocational guidance should have been included in the report for comparison with textbooks of a more general character I pass on this criticism like that expressed above not in any spirit of faultfinding but simply for what it is worth The committees whose reports were presented at Cleveland have done a work of great value and I should be pleased to cooperate with them in every way possiblenot in the least to be unduly critical of the careful studies which they have made PEABODY HIGH SCHOOL R O HUGHES PITTSBURGH PENNSYLVANIA1920 EDUCATIONAL NEWS AND EDITORIAL COMMENT 333 NEWS ITEMS FROM SECONDARY SCHOOLS GRADING ENGLISH Faribault High School Faribault MinnesotaA system of credits is used in evaluating composition work of junior and senior highschool pupils The graph shows the six classes of the two schools each class being separated into C B and A groups accord ing to individual differences in ability It shows that excellence in expression is considered dependent upon correct mechanics clear ness and subjectmatter English is graded by every instructor in every classroom In fact some of the best English work is accomplished by the head of the chemistry department The C pupils B pupils and A pupils are marked according to the way in which they can assimilate material and we find that definiteness and clearness of expression is the best means of judging the intelligence of the child that is credit for English and credit for subjectmatter go hand in hand All teachers of all departments are supervisors of expression because expression is the test of their pupils intelligence in the subjectmatter they teach The school seems to be approach ing English oral and written from the correct point of view Mechanics is awarded 20 per cent credit throughout the 18 sections of the six grades Be it understood that the two schools in Faribault have a carefully worked out system of minimum essen tials in English elements of increasing difficulty being added for each year of school life Moreover pupils of C standing are not held to requirements as difficult as their classmates of B or A standing Carrying out further the principle of individual instruc tion we cause pupils to fail who score 90 per cent when they should be making 95 per cent whereas we pass pupils who are scoring but 70 per cent when they are capable of producing but 70 per cent The scale of minimal essentials increasing in difficulty grade by grade is justification for according as much credit to a twelfth grade pupil as to a seventhgrade pupil By clearness is meant the relation of thought to subjectmatter including important rhetorical considerations which are also scaled according to difficulty for the advancing types and grades Very suggestive is the chart in showing that the relative value of clear ness increases 5 per cent with successive types in the same grade and 5 per cent with the same type in successive grades On the334 THE SCHOOL REVIEW contrary credits for mastery of subjectmatter gradually

Company and others From a decree in favor of complainants defendants appeal Mod ified VWm W Old  Son John B Jenkins and W L Williams for appellants las E Heath R C Marshall and W H Sargeant Jr for appellees BUCHANAN J In the year 1867 D C Barraud Sr died in the city of Norfolk leaving a will by which among other things he gave to his grandson D C Barraud jr a life estate in a farm containing 100 acres known as Barrons with remainder to his lawful issue if he should die leaving any and if he should die without such issue then the remainder was tcr pass under the residuary clause of the will to the persons named therein Upon the death of the testator the life tenant took possession of the Barrons farm and subsequently incumbered his estate by deeds of trust and judgments In the year 1874 D C Barraud Jr and others united as com plainants in a chancery suit against R C Marshall and others The object of the suit as stated in the bill was to construe the said will to fix and determine the rights and interests of the various parties interested therein to protect and provide for the annuities and to make partition in kind of the real estate so de vised by the said D C Barraud deceased to and among the par ties entitledthereto according to their respective shares and inSUBURBAN CO V TURNER terests so that the part or share of your orator the said D C Barraud therein may be set apart in kind if practicable and so far as practicable and sold for the benefit of the creditors under the said deeds of trust and judgment creditors aforesaid In the year 1875 a decree was entered directing the sale of the Barrons farm remainder as well as the life estate In the vear 1878 a consent decree was entered confirming a private sale of the farm to William H Turner This decree also ascertained the remainder interest in the proceeds of that sale to be 115010 and directed it to be deposited in the Citizens Bank of Norfolk bearing compound interest to await the death of the life tenant and at the same term of the court a final decree was entered striking the case from the docket In the year 1885 William H Turner the purchaser at the sale mentioned died leaving a will by which he devised the Barrons farm to his son Henry L Turner during his life and the re mainder in fee to his grandson William H Ti ner Jr In the year 1891 the said Henry L Turner and William H Turner Jr conveyed to the North East Norfolk Land Company the whole of the Barrons farm with covenants of general warranty but in the year 1894 the said land company reconveyed to Henry L Turner for life and the remainder in fee to William H Turner Jr about 30 acres of the said farm The residue of the Bar rons farm about 70 acres is now owned by or is subject to the liens of the appellants except the Citizens Bank of Norfolk In the year 1901 Henry L Turner the life tenant of the 30 acres of the Barrons farm and the heirs of the remainderman William H Turner Jr deceased instituted a suit against the children of D C Barraud Jr to remove a cloud upon the title to the said 30 acres of land growing out of the claim of the children of the said D C Barraud Jr that they were not parties to nor bound by the decrees entered in the cause of Barraud et al 7v Marshall et al heretofore referred to Upon a hearing of the said cause of Turner et al v Barraud et al the circuit court of the city of Norfolk held that the action of the court in selling the remainder interest of the children of D C Barraud in the Bar rons farm was not binding upon them and that the decrees and other proceedings in the cause of Barraud et al v Marshall et al so far as they affect the rights of the said children in and to the land in controversy were null and void Upon appeal that ac tion of the circuit court was affirmed The history of the case and the reasons for this courts decision are fully set out in the opinion of the court in the report of the case which is found in 102 Va 324338 46 S E 318 After the affirmance of the decree appealed from in that case the personal representative of William H Turner deceased the purchaser of the Barrons farm in the case of Barraud et al v 1906 46312 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Marshall et al instituted his suit in the circuit court against the Citizens Banfc of the City of Norfolk and others to compel that bank to pay or turn over to him the said sum of 115010 and its interest deposited with that bank under decree of the court in the case of Barraud et al v Marshall et al as above stated The ground upon which the complainant bases his right to maintain his suit to recover the said sum is as stated in his bill that inasmuch as the said William H Turner under the decrees in the said case of Barraud et al v Marshall et al acquired only an estate for and during the life of D C Barraud Jr in the Barrons farm a trust immediately arose to pay back to him the said sum of 115010 and that in equity the same continued tc be and was at his death the property of William H Turner and that the complainant as his personal representative is en titled to recover the same from the said Citizens Bank of Nor folk which is trustee for whoever might be entitled thereto and that inasmuch as the suit of Barraud et al v Marshall et al had been removed from the docket it had become necessary for him to institute a new suit in order to recover the said sum At the instance of the Citizens Bank the stakeholder all per sons in interest were made parties to the suit and upon a hear ing of the cause the circuit court granted the relief prayed for in the bill From that decree the Citizens Bank and the parties who claim title to or liens upon the 70 acres of the Barrons farm under Henry L Turner and William H Turner Jr dev isees of Wm H Turner Sr obtained this appeal As above stated D C Barraud Sr devised a life estate in the Barrons farm to D C Barraud Jr and the remainder to his lawful issue and in the event he died without lawful issue to the testators heirs and the money representing the proceeds of that remainder interest was deposited in the Citizens Bank of Norfolk carrying compound interest for the benefit of such per son or persons as may be entitled to the same under the will of D C Barraud Sr at the death of D C Barraud Jr It was held in the case of Turner v Barraud 102 Va 324 46 S E 318 that the sale of the remainder so far as it affected the rights of the issue of D C Barraud Jr was null and void as to the 30 acres of the Barrauds farm involved in that case But the heirs of D C Barraud Sr were not parties to that suit Neither were the alienees of Henry L Turner and William H Turner Jr the devisees of William H Turner Sr the claim ants of the 70 acres residue of the Barrons farm parties to it The decree in that case cannot affect the rights of the parties to this suit who were not parties to that suit But as the facts in this case are substantially the same as in that case as to the validity of the sale of the remainder so far as it affected the rights of the issue of D C Barraud Jr a like conclusion ought 464 OctSUBURBAN CO V TURNER to be reached in this case Treating however the sale of the re mainder in the Barrons farm in the case of Barraud et al v Marshall et al as a nullity so far as it affected the rights of the issue of D C Barraud Jr it does not follow that it was a nullity as to the heirs of D C Barraud Sr They were parties to that suit and consented to the decree which confirmed the sale of the Barrons farm which included the remainder as well as the life estate This being so they would not be heard to object that the sale as to them was not valid and binding and upon the death of D C Barraud Jr without issue as it is possible the heirs of D C Barraud Sr would be entitled to the fund deposited in the Citizens Bank and the title to the remainder interest in the Bar rons farm would be perfected in those who have acquired the rights of William H Turner Sr the purchaser in the case of Barraud et al v Turner et al In that event the estate of Wil liam H Turner Sr will not be entitled to the fund in bank nor will the parties who claim under him If it were paid to the personal representative of said Turner now or to those who claim under him he would be getting what he may not be en titled to and the heirs of D C Barraud Sr might be deprived of what they might be entitled to In either event injustice might be done But if the money qn deposit in bank is held until the death of D C Barraud Jr then and not till then will it be known with certainty to whom it should be paid This seems to us the only safe and proper course to pursue and the circuit court should have so held and dismissed the bill of the personal representative of William H Turner Sr de ceased without prejudice Note The ruling of the court in this case is clearly supported by the weight of authority Equity will interpose to protect the interest of the remaindermen and where that remainder is lost to the remainder man by sale or removal it will order the owner of the life estate or a stranger to restore the value of the remainder A purchaser from the particular tenant in possession of a chattel takes subject to the rights of the remainderman though the deed of gift creating the estates be not recorded unless he bought without notice or unless the tenant has been in possession during three years Rev Code p 358 art 2 Gibson v Jayne 37 Miss 164 Where A the tenant for the life of another of certain slaves re moved the slaves to another state and sold nothing more than his own interest in them it was held that B the remainderman could not maintain a suit in equity against A therefor unless the removal and sale were effected fraudulently for the purpose of injuring B and an injury actually resulted Lee v McBride 41 N C 533 Where one has a remainder in personal property which is sold by the life tenant equity will require the purchaser to give security to protect the remainderman Gill v Tittle 14 Ala 528 A remainderman cannot complain of a trespass upon the tenant for 1906 46512 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER life unless such trespass in some way endangers his remaider

defendant who had knowledge of the sisters contingent interest and who in the lifetime of the brother removed them from the state and sold them for a higher price than they would have brought in the state Held that the sisters were entitled to a decree in equity for the actual value of the slaves before they were removed from the state Sanderford v Moore 54 N C 206 Where chattels were left to a

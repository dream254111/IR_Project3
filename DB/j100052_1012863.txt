j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1012863,Annual Reassessment versus the Unearned Increment Tax,i242643,ANNUAL REASSESSMENT VERSUS THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX BY ALFRED D BERNARD LLB Attorney at Law Baltimore Md The basic reasons for the taxation of real estate for local purposes are that the local government especially safeguards the local property its expenditures are largely beneficial to real estate and in its expen ditures more or less attracts a community which becomes prosperous under good government and wise expenditures that the community grows thus creating a demand for land that the real estate assumes a value which is given to it by the community that the growth of the community creates constantly new and changing values shifting utilities for land and in many instances increases the values that the land being a tangible expression of the power of the community to utilize land may be said to have a community value which it has received from the local government and therefore should be taxed On this basic proposition the average intelligent subjects of the United States are apparently unanimous But there is a great diversity of opinion as to whether real estate should bear the burden of local taxation or whether the tax should be confined to the land with a scaling valuation for improvements or whether the improve ments should be eliminated altogether Moreover there are advo cates of taxing what is termed the unearned increment which if the writer correctly understands is intended to exact from the landowner a portion of the difference between the market values of his land at intervals on the theory that the increment attaching to the land is through no effort of the owner but through the growth of the com munity Assuming that there is such a thing as an unearned increment attaching to land is it fairly a subject of taxation And if it is a subject of taxation is it fair to tax this so called unearned increment and also tax the land at the various periods of reassessment at the then market value of the land And if this proposition shocks the spirit of fairness will an annual reassessment be a fair substitute for the unearned increment tax 202THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX The fundamental of all taxation is equality Quoting from the constitution of Maryland Article 15 of the Declaration of Rights following the proposition laid down by Adam Smith in his Wealth of Nations published originally in 1776   every person in the state or person holding property therein ought to contribute his portion of public taxes for the support of the government according to his actual worth in real and personal property Before attempting to tax the unearned increment we should make a practical effort to see if we can ascertain what it is and a few illustrations based on fact may be timely In 1898 Smith bought 1000 shares of Atchison common at 13 per share and locked it up in a safe deposit box For a few months after his purchase it fluctuated around buying price but it never got below 13 and when he sold out at one hundred per share the con tribution of the public and the very excellent management of the road by way of unearned increment amounted to 87000 less commis sions The same day Brown bought a small lot on H Street improved by an old dwelling for 10000 It was hard to rent at 500 and Brown studied the situation and concluded that the conversion of this property into a moder shop would be a wise move He accord ingly spent 3000 in introducing modern heating plumbing lighting a swell store front and creditable decorations When he finished his repairs he had 13000 invested in the property By the exercise of patience and tact he finally succeeded in getting a tenant who took a long lease at a scaling rent starting at 600 and advancing 100 a year so that in 1909 the property was producing 1600 per annum the pioneer tenant in the block was doing a splendid business and other shops had followed him the utility of the block had completely changed in ten years and the tenant feeling that his business was growing rapidly bought the property from Brown for 30000 the tenant and Brown both agreeing that the property was actually worth 20000 at the time of the purchase but Brown thought that it would ultimately go to 40000 the seller discounting and the buyer purchasing the future increment In this instance the daring Brown in risking his capital the energy of the tenant in pulling business another block the contribu tion of the ever increasing public by way of the so called unearned increment produced 17000 203THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY The day Smith sold out he met a friend who had a perfectly sure thing in beer selling around 80 but going to 120 before spring and Smith bought 1000 shares In three years that concern went into the hands of a receiver and Smith lost 70000 One more incident The day Brown sold out he felt pretty chesty and took his wife out in a demonstrator They passed a very swell looking suburban plot beautifully shaded with a large compelling house on which was a bargain sign The property was being shown to a prospect so they went in The wife raved over the shade trees thought the outlook a dream and the perfume of the hay field opposite the one thing necessary to complete her happiness Twenty thousand dollars would buy it with five acres of ground and the house cost over 20000 to build It was a bargain how could the owner be so foolish as to part with it Brown bought the property spent 2000 renovating the house and installed Mrs Brown in her new paradise opposite the hayfield view The next spring the owner of the hayfield sold it and before the summer was over a row of two story houses of exasperating monotony was shutting out the beautiful view and the perfume of the hayfield was punctuated by an odor of fresh plaster and burning pitch Mrs Brown had hysterics and her physician ordered her out of the house with dire penalties for disobedience Brown sold out for 7900 the value of the lot the mansion house was torn down and two story houses erected The contribution to this unearned increment was minus Incidents like these are the practical premises from which the thoughtful student of economics must draw his deductions Smiths friends called him a master of finance until he bought beer common then his friends said   Brown was regarded likewise by his friends before and after Now if the city exacted a part of Smiths profit on the Atchison deal and Browns profit on the real estate deal ought it not fairly return Smith a share of his loss in beer common or Browns loss because he could not see that the suburban property he had purchased was obsolete Such an argument brings the blush of shame to the most ardent student of social economics yet it is the fundamental principle of taxation that a man should pay taxes on his worth in real and personal property But again the unearned increment taxer is willing to let Smith go free on the theory perhaps that his profit being a gamblers 204THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX profit he is liable under the law of averages to lose out on his next deal or perhaps he is not able to fix the community value attaching to a stock jobbing transaction Can he fix it on the realty deal Let us analyze this transaction Browns paper profit was 17000 Against this should be charged the taxes repairs and inter est on his original capital and the fund should be credited with the rent so that the actual profit was approximately 15000 of which 5000 was increment and 10000 a tax the tenant paid to the land lord for the privilege of being owner of the good will of the place If this increment were solely the contribution of the community why does one merchant succeed and another fail If this increment is solely the contribution of the community why do values shift with shifting utilities And why in the average large city have the incre ments attaching to suburban property been largely if not totally offset by the shrinkages in the inside residence districts We believe there is an increment attaching to land in certain locations due to the natural growth of the community which affects its selling value but the community rarely localizes it The best corner lot in a given city is seldom the geographical centre or even the centre of population but is largely due to the enterprise of indi viduals the power of advertising and the consent of the community to be drawn to a given point for a purpose and that purpose is usually a belief that an advantage may be gained at the particular point If ten merchants would open as many large department stores at spaced distances on Fifth Avenue in New York between Union Square and Central Park with ample capital and make generous advertising expenditures the chances are the five to the south would fail but if the ten would agree to locate at or near Broadway and Fortyfourth Street it is more than likely that the whole retail business district of New York would be shifted twelve blocks north land values in the new district would be quadrupled and the present district would be cut in half The community would contribute to the increment of the new section by seeking it to buy goods but the moving factors in the enterprise would be the persons who risked vast sums of money to create the new district The owner of a farm on Long Island sees the city grow steadily towards his property So long as it is a farm its highest market value is expressed in its capacity to produce hence its utility fixes its highest market value As the city approaches it it assumesa 205THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY potential or speculative value in that it will soon be ready for a sub division and its value increases beyond its farming utility value Yet it is not ready for the market and the chances are that a sub division would be a complete failure But with the growth of the city it becomes ready for suburban development and the owner sells out to a promoter who interests capital and capital takes a business risk and is successful The increment undoubtedly attached to the farm with the growth of the city but until it was developed it was a farm and the development required individual effort capital and management to make it successful The owner may or may not have made a profit notwithstanding the apparent paper profit the sale showed on the original cost as it is a well known fact that many a rural tract held for development has been held so long that the paper profit did not equal the interest the owner would have realized if the cost of the property had been invested in government bonds at 2 per cent One more illustration before passing to the main subject The owners of the respective corners of the block on Main Street erect imposing sky scrapers thus increasing the traffic on Main Street and the inside lots double in value This must surely be an increment due wholly to the community But after the office buildings are twenty years old the owners find that they will not pay their fixed charges and they have erected monuments to their own asininity The owners of the lots improved by the old shacks are offering expres sions of sympathy but no rent The gains in the middle of the block are largely offset by the losses on the corners This brings us to the main argument If there is any increment attaching to land which may be said to be unearned it does not attach over night but is a growth which is the expression of the growth and buying power of the community No one would advance the theory that a successful merchant should give up a share of his annual profit to support the local community but all will agree that he should contribute an equal percentage of his worth whether it be expressed in real or personal property and while no one would advance the theory seriously that a professional man should yield up a portion of his annual income to support the local government yet all will agree that if he invests a part of his earnings it becomes capital to him and the investment should be taxed 206THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX So with real estate It is the tangible expression of invested cap ital and because it is tangible a word which has the same root as touch and tax it has become the target of the community collector It represents the whole or a portion of the owners worth and should bear its proportion of the cost of government Under annual re assessment if it increases in value the community gets the taxable percentage of the increment plus the capital invested if on the other hand it depreciates in value the owner is correspondingly worth less and the shrinkage is evidenced by the amount of the assessment But he is still paying his fair portion of the burden of government This argument is sound and has its basic thought in equality which is equity The inequality does not lie in the amount of the increment but in the lack of the necessary machinery to properly appraise it and the machinery to review the appraisement from time to time so that the owner is paying on its present market value and not on a value fixed at a remote period Now assuming the constitutional provision is sound that the individual must pay on his worth and not on his earning power or the earning power of his capital directed by his energy the practical question foI the municipality is What is the individual worth To ascertain this that which he owns must be competently appraised and to competently appraise and review the appraisement the taxing power must provide the means and when this means is found and furnished if it is competent and sufficiently active the fair market value of the wealth of the subject whether expressed in unimproved land or real estate or certain forms of personalty may be annually ascertained and uniformly and equitably taxed thus yielding to the support of the local community a percentage of the original capital plus the annual increment less the annual shrinkage In the judgment of the writer this is all the community has a right to demand And if the demand is fairly met the community will be more prosperous and the burden of taxation more evenly distributed and less onerous than by special taxation of the brains and energy of certain individuals who happen to be successful money makers Will annual reassessment be a fair substitute for the increment tax In the larger cities values are constantly changing due in part to the growth of the city the shifting of utilities and the caprices of the citizens Real estate has cycles of prosperity and adversity and 207THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY values rise and fall with the market If values were solely the ex pression of the number and buying power of the community they should gradually rise as the community grows But those of us who have real estate holdings are sadly aware of the fact that need desire and caprice constantly change values These changes are most rapid in the commercial centres and in the suburbs and are generally downward in the intermediate points To properly appraise values so that an equitable basis of assessment including the increment may be had it is in the writers judgment necessary that the real property in all large cities and such personal property as may be locally the subject of taxation by law should be annually appraised While the average thinking man will generally approve annual reassessment in any community where the annual increment is more than the cost of ascertaining its value there are a number of ques tions arising as to how unimproved land should be appraised for local taxation Any number of plausible and ingenious arguments have been advanced whereby land which produces no return in rent should be appraised at a different value or taxed at a different rate from improved property A number of cities have urban suburban and rural rates of taxation with tests of classification others with a uniform rate have special or partial exemption features for vacant land All these features are in the judgment of the writer wrong in spirit The object of the taxing power is to secure revenue its desire should be to secure it by taxing value and not earnings While the rent an improved property will produce is if properly capitalized a safe guide as to the value of the whole and where the improvements are adequate to the site the difference between the cost of the improve ment less deterioration and the value of the whole will fairly repre sent the land value still if the value is in unimproved real estate it is because it has a potential earning power if improved and present realization value if sold If the citizen owns 10000 worth of real estate it does not make any difference whether it is in a downtown warehouse or an undeveloped suburb the rate and assessment should be the same The argument that the owner of unimproved land gets no revenue and therefore should have a special rate creates the single taxer and increment taxer If the unimproved real estate is worth 208THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX its appraised value it is because the seller may in normal times under normal conditions realize on it And if he does not realize it is be cause he believes that it is going higher than interest on his present realization value which is an increment Another subtle argument which the owner of unimproved land advances is that if land is taxed at its full value it brings about an overimprovement of site creating ruinous competition in improved properties causing vast wastes in capital and the withdrawal of capital from real estate investment unusual vacancies with attendant demoralization This is undoubtedly true where the community undertakes to penalize land out of useby making it the sole object of taxation Thus it is now becoming apparent in so called single tax communi ties that the penalization of land and the exemption of improvements have created an overproduction of improved properties not only forcing values downward but causing the withdrawal of capital from real estate And here let us state parenthetically without any at tempt to be academic that there is no such thing as the survival of the fittest in real estate When values are depressed by reason of overproduction in warehouses all warehouse property is affected When there is an overproduction of shops all shop property is affected and on through the list Too many properties to choose from makes a choice uncertain and the purchaser withdraws from the market But the practical answer to this argument lies in being able to distinguish the real value Where a vacant lot in the heart of the city is held out of use it cannot be because of overproduction but because the owner is unwilling to improve it unable to satisfy his mind as to how to improve it or because the increment is in his judg ment more than the increment would be plus the interest on the invested capital to improve Such an owner should pay on real value Where there is a doubt as to whether the location of the land is such that its highest utility is apparent this will be reflected in its true value and should be treated accordingly Thus in a semi residence district in a transition state if the improvements have anything like a construction value the land has a residence value only and if the land has a business value the improvements are obsolete In either case the whole will fairly balance and should be so considered But to force a business value on the lot and at the 209THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY same time carry a construction value on the improvement is mani festly unfair Hence we see in all the large cities this particular class of property bearing more than its share of the taxable burden requir ing skill and judgment in the assessor to differentiate There is a section however in every large city where the question of local taxation is acute and conditions are hard to meet So long as a tract of rural land remains undeveloped it should not be appraised for taxation for more money than it is reasonably worth as undeveloped property notwithstanding that the adjoining tract may be developed To make this clear if Blackacre farm sold three years ago at 1000 per acre and the owner laid it out into building lots and sold out at the rate of 5000 per acre to one hundred cus tomers after three years of hard work and the expenditure of large sums in development Longacre the adjoining tract is not worth over 1000 per acre plus the increment which attaches by the devel opment of Blackacre which may not be an increment but indicates that the demand for lots was not up to the supply notwithstanding that single acres might be marketed for 3000 In many cities the student of taxation problems will find on one side of the road assessments at 1000 per acre on undeveloped land and on the opposite side assessments around 4000 per acre on build ing lots which would apparently be entirely out of harmony But the average suburban development must be marketed in lots at 500 per cent profit over original cost to provide for loss of area in streets and alleys cost of introducing the various services provid ing streets drainage advertising and selling cost interest on the investment and a hundred little things which creep into the cost of marketing a suburb A still more difficult problem than the above confronts the as sessor and that is the appraisement of land in bulk in the developer and the individual lot owner in the same subdivision So long as Blackacre is a farm it has an acreage value As soon as streets are laid out and the lots staked off it becomes a subdivision a pioneer price is placed on each lot and a number of the choice lots marked sold whether they have been sold or not The assessor has no difficulty in getting the asking price and institutes comparisons with adjacent developments He may reach a conclusion that the lots are priced too high and will not bring the asking price and will turn them in at say 70 per cent The lots are figured at 500 per 210THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX cent profit and the owner has concluded that he will be ten years working out He promptly appeals and makes this argument It is true I paid 1000 ner acre for this farm and that I have sold five lots out of two hundred at 5000 per acre Notwithstanding this profit I will lose money unless I sell out all my holding in ten years But if I sell out now I will make money at 3000 an acre notwithstanding my expenditures And while I want a thousand dollars for one fifth of an acre of land I will sell you all I have at 3000 per acre or 300 per cent on my original investment which would cut down this assessment to 60 per cent of the sale price of the lots Now how are you going to meet it You cannot If the land is worth 1000 per acre undeveloped and the owner after spending 1500 per acre on it is willing to sell out at 3000 it is because as a wholesale proposition that is its value Therefore the assessor will start in at say 3000 and each year advance the assessment as the lots are sold Such a treatment is in the writers judgment the only equitable appraisement It rarely happens that suburban land is advanta geously marketed without large expenditures in buildings to establish the atmosphere These establishments are frequently sold to people who are desirable socially at large monetary losses which losses are capitalized up against the remaining lots While a number of developers think a low assessment a desirable asset in marketing the land it often presents to the enquiring mind of the prospective purchaser the question that either the assessor does not know what he is doing or the purchaser is getting trimmed unmercifully and when he reaches the latter conclusion he is no longer a prospective purchaser While these values are equalizing themselves the individual assessments on the lots bought and improved should not be materially changed until the whole subdivision may be said to be fairly estab lished and then increase them uniformly at intervals until the full value of the individual lots has been reached which will be usually around or less than the original selling value The equality expert goes through the books and points the finger of scorn at the supposed under assessments But are they under assessments The individual lot buyer is to a certain extent the tool of the promoter and if there are not enough of them to establish the par ticular suburb in a reasonable time the values recede and the developer cuts his prices to quicken the market Thus the pioneer 211THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY purchaser must either help the developer or the developer will under sell and thus cheapen the pioneers purchase And if he takes this risk in becoming a pioneer can his holding be said to have a market value equal to its purchase price until approximately all the lots are sold and the property developed beyond the experimental stage The last feature of the subject we can touch on in this article is the question of land contours soil formations grades etc If the expression of value is fixed by the sale of one or more lots in a suburb the character of the land is important and the assessor in seeking to value the lots uniformly must take these features into consideration A gentle terrace a few feet high may be considered desirable If the land has to be filled up the fair cost of filling the same should be deducted plus the cost of the extra foundation of a building reason ably adapted to the lot if it be found that the fill was below founda tion depth If on the other hand there is a hill with an outcropping of rock which cannot be treated the question of moving the rock must be considered Where the lots run to a swamp they must be separately treated and it frequently happens that such lots are practically valueless in low priced subdivisions We have seen adjoining lots of the same shape and size with vastly different values per foot because of these minor factors So that uniformity in assessment expressed by the foot or acre must be the expression of value and not the answer to a sum in arithmetic In conclusion most real estate owners are community grouches and a happy taxpayer as rare as a genuine Rembrandt He feels the burden which is ever increasing and the tendency of moder govern ment to exempt all forms of personalty and thus double the burden of real estate No one would think of buying a piece of real estate which is not a subject of larceny without properly recording the deed But be cause of lax laws valuable personal securities which could be stolen are unregistered and their owners often unknown Against this the argument goes to heaven that business is the life of the government and taxation at the source is taxing business But here comes the inexorable law of supply and demand The cotton lies unpicked on the fields because there is an overproduction of cotton From the homes of the poor comes the wail we cannot afford to buy meat Why Because the land is too high to be utilized for cattle production The farmers have found new utilities for the 212THE UNEARNED INCREMENT TAX land the country is being divided into building lots and truck farms arid plains are being irrigated into orchards apples are worth a fifth of a cent to the producer and 3 to 5 cents to the consumer the consumer and the producer are both groaning under the weight of taxation and the railroads carrying so much water that they have no room for apples and three or four middlemen untaxed making a profit out of that innocent apple before it gets to the 3 cent buyer Let the taxation theorist who sees one side boil it down to its final analysis looking at it from every angle and he will find that the ultimate security of the bulk of the wealth of the country is in real estate that the fictitious or paper wealth of the country is the capital ization of the individual effort to utilize either the forces of nature or the real estate expressed in franchises as well as actual ownership of land and its appurtenances that the fictitious wealth is more than the actual that generally it is untaxed but generally carries control that this control is not only a holding force but an influencing force not infrequently a corrupting force that the taxing power requires other sources of revenue than real estate that the socalled unearned increment is a mere cipher in the unthinkable figures which express the wealth of this country that as real estate is the only tangible expression of wealth its value must be stablized or the country will go the way of ancient Rome that land values may only be kept up by the lure at least of an increment more than the average interest yields that before you attempt to tax the increment you must first determine that it is unearned which is a very difficult thing to do and that to tax it is to advertise it to advertise it is to encourage a gambling scheme for viewed from its rosiest aspect it is a gamble and lastly that real estate speculation does not increase values but tends to make them uncertain and a national depression in real estate will have as disastrous an effect on the body politic as a wholo as an overproduction of cotton or a scarcity of beef 213

J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,104948,AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT BENEFIT OF VENTILATORS IN MANY INSTANCES IN PRESERVING THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF PEOPLE IN SLAVE AND OTHER TRANSPORT SHIPS BY STEPHEN HALES D D F R S,I206914,LV AN ACCOUNT OF THE GREAT BENEFIT OF VEN TILATORS IN MANY INSTANCES IN PRESERVING THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF PEOPLE IN SLAVE AND OTHER TRANSPORT SHIPS BY STEPHEN HALES D D F R S IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE SEVERAL MEANS HERE PROPOSED FOR HAVING FRESH AND SWEET WATER AT SEA WILL BE GREAT BENEFIT IN PRE SERVING THE HEALTH AND LIVES OF MULTITUDES OF THAT VALU ABLE READ DEC 18 43 1755333 ABLE AND USEFUL PART OF MANKINDTHOSE WHO OCCUPY THEIR BUHNESS IN GREAT WATERS WHOSE WELFARE I HAVE LONG HAD AT HEART AND ENDEAVOURED TO PROMOTE BY VARIOUS WAYS ESPECIALLY BY FINDING MEANS TO PROCURE THEM FRESH SALUTARY AIR INSTEAD OF THE NOXIOUS PUTRID CLOSE CONFINED PESTILENTIAL AIR WHICH HAS DESTROYED MILLIONS OF MANKIND IN SHIPS AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT BY DILIGENT RESEARCHES FARTHER AND FARTHER USE FUL DISCOVERIES WILL HEREAFTER BE MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF NAVIGATION 44 THE FOLLOWING AS THEY ARE STRONG PROFFS OF THE GREAT BENEFIT AND USEFULNESS OF VENTILATORS IN SHIPS SO THEY ALSO FULLY PROVE THAT THEY CAN MOST COMMO DIOUSLY BE FIXED AND WORKED IN THEM IN CONTRADICTION TO THE VULGAR FALSE AND GROUNDLESS NOTION THAT THEY TAKE UP TOO MUCH ROOM AND ARE INCOMMODIOUS AND IN A MANNER IMPRACTICABLE TO BE WORKED WHEREAS THE MEN ARE EAGER TO WORK THEM AND MANY MORE PER SONS CAN BE WITH SAFETY TO THEIR HEALTH AND LIVES IN A VENTILATED THAN IN AN UNVENTILATED SHIP WHICH FULLY OBVIATES THE OBJECTION AS TO THE ROOM THEY TAKE UP IN NEW AND IMPORTANT RESEARCHES THE LIKELIEST WAY TO SUCCEED IS TO PURSUE A THOUGHT NOT ONLY BY IMPER FECT AND FALLACIOUS REASONINGS BUT WHEN THE NATURE OF THE THING REQUIRES IT WITH A PROPER SERIES OF TRIALS AND EXPERIMENTS THUS IN THE PRESENT CASE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE SICKNESS IN SHIPS IS THE NOXIOUS PUTRID AIR THE OBVIOUS REMEDY IS THE EXCHANGING THAT FOUL AIR FOR FRESH BY EFFECTUAL MEANS WHICH ARE SELDOM DISCOVERED BY DWELLING ONLY ON OBJECT ONS BUT ARE USUALLY THE REWARD OF REPEATED DILIGENT EX PERIMENTAL RESEARCHES NEITHER ARE WE TO BE DIS COURAGED IN THESE OUR PURSUITS BY SOME DISAPPOINT MENTS334 MENTS FOR I HAVE FREQUENTLY FOUND THAT THEY LEAD TO THE THING SOUGHT FOR AND BY THE LIKE CLUE OF REASONING AND EXPERIMENTING THERE IS THE GREATEST PROBABILITY THAT WE SHALL SUCCEED IN ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT RESEARCH VIZ THE PRESERVING MUCH LONGER FROM DECAY THE TIMBERS OF SHIPS LAID UP IN ORDINARY IN HARBOUR FOR AS WE ARE ASSURED BY DAILY EXPERI ENCE THAT THE DECAY IS WHOLLY OWING TO DAMP CLOSE CONFINED PUTRID CORRODING AIR SO THE ONLY REMEDY FOR THIS EVIL IS THE FREQUENTLY CHANGING THE AIR AMONG THE TIMBERS BY PLENTIFUL VENTILATIONS WHICH WE FIND BY HAPPY EXPERIENCE CAN BE EFFECTED TO SUCH A DEGREE AS GIVES REASONABLE HOPES ENOUGH TO ENCOU RAGE OUR FARTHER TRIALS AND RESEARCHES 45 CAPTAIN THOMSON OF THE SUCCESS FRIGATE IN HIS LETTER TO ME DATED LONDON SEPT 25 1749 SAYS  THAT DURING THE VENTILATION THE LOWERDECK  HATCHES WERE COMMONLY KEPT CLOSE SHUT BY  WHICH MEANS THE AIR WAS DRAWN DOWN INTO THE  HOLD FROM BETWEEN THE DECKS THROUGH THE SEAMS  OF THE CEILING ALONG THE TIMBERS OF THE SHIP BY  WHICH MEANS WE FOUND THE FOUL AIR SOON DRAWN  OFF FROM BETWEEN DECKS OUR RULE FOR VENTILAT  ING WAS FOR HALF AN HOUR EVERY FOUR HOURS BUT  WHEN THE VENTILATING WAS SOMETIMES NEGLECTED FOR  EIGHT HOURS TOGETHER THEN WE COULD PERCEIVE ESPE  CIALLY IN HOT WEATHER A VERY SENSIBLE DIFFERENCE BY  THAT SHORT NEGLECT OF IT FOR IT WOULD THEN TAKE A  LONGER TIME TO DRAW OFF THE FOUL AIR OUR GENERAL  RULE WAS TO WORK THE VENTILATORS TILL WE FOUND THE  AIR FROM THEM SWEET WE ALL AGREED THAT THEY  WERE OF GREAT SERVICE THE MEN BEING SO SENSIBLE  OF THE BENEFIT OF THEM THAT THEY REQUIRED NO  DRIVING335  DRIVING TO WORK THAT WHICH THEY RECEIVED SO MUCH  BENEFIT BY WE FOUND THIS GOOD EFFECT FROM VEN  TILATION THAT THOUGH THERE WERE NEAR 200 MEN ON  BOARD FOR ALMOST A YEAR YET I LANDED THEM ALL  WELL IN GEORGIA NOTWITHSTANDING THEY WERE PRESSED  MEN AND DELIVERED ME OUT OF GAOLS WITH DI  STEMPERS UPON THEM THIS IS WHAT I BELIEVE BUT  FEW TRANSPORTS OR ANY OTHER SHIPS CAN BRAG OF  NOT DID I EVER MEET THE LIKE GOODLUCK BEFORE  WHICH NEXT TO PROVIDENCE I IMPUTE TO THE BENE  FIT RECEIVED BY THE VENTILATORS IT IS TO BE RE  MARKED THAT WE WHO LAY WINDBOUND FOR FOUR  MONTHS WITH OUR EXPEDITION FLEET WHICH SOON  AFTER INVADED FRANCE WERE VERY HEALTHY ALL THE  TIME WHEN THEY WERE VERY SICKLY IN ALL THE SHIPS  OF THAT EXPEDITION 46  THIS CERTAINLY OCCASIONED ALL KIND OF GRAIN  PROVISIONS TO KEEP BETTER AND LONGER FROM WEE  VELS THAN OTHERWISE THEY WOULD HAVE DONE AND  OTHER KINDS OF PROVISIONS RECEIVED BENEFIT FROM THE  COOLNESS AND FRESHNESS IN THE AIR OF THE SHIP WHICH  WAS CAUSED BY VENTILATION 47 MR CRAMOND ALSO INFORMS ME THAT HE FOUND THE GOOD EFFECT OF VENTILATORS ON BOARD A SLAVESHIP OF HIS WITH 392 SLAVES TWELVE OF WHICH WERE TAKEN ON BOARD JUST BEFORE THEY SAILED FROM GUINEA ILL OF A FLUX WHICH TWELVE ALL DIED BUT THE REST WITH ALL THE EUROPEANS IN THE SHIP ARRIVED WELL AT BUENOS AYRES THE336 THE FOLLOWING IS A LETTER TO ME FROM CAPTAIN ELLIS VIZ S I R 48  C O U L D ANY THING INCREASE THE PLEASURE I  HAVE IN A LITERARY INTERCOURSE WITH YOU IT  WOULD BE TO FIND THAT IT ANSWERED YOUR END IN PRO  MOTING THE PUBLIC GOOD THE VIS INERTIAE OF  MANKIND IS NOT THE ONLY DIFFICULTY YOU HAVE HAD  TO ENCOUNTER BUT THEIR IGNORANCE AND PREJUDICES  WHICH ARE ALMOST INSUPERABLE IT IS TO YOUR PER  SEVERANCE AND RESOLUTION THAT THE LITTLE PROGRESS  YOU HAVE MADE IS DUE INDEED I OUGHT NOT TO SAY  LITTLE FOR IT IS A GREAT STEP TO HAVE FOUND THE FEW  THAT HAVE HEARTS GOOD ENOUGH TO RELISH YOUR PLAN  AND HEADS SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO DISCERN THE MOST  EFFECTUAL METHOD OF ADVANCING IT IT DOES HONOUR  TO THOSE NOBLE AND OTHER WORTHY PERSONAGES THAT  JOIN YOU IN ACTS OF SUCH EXTENSIVE HUMANITY AS  THE INTRODUCTION OF VENTILATORS TO HOSPITALS PRISONS  SHIPS OF WAR AND TRANSPORT C AS THEY MUST NE  CESSARILY RENDER THE MISERIES OF THE FIRST MORE SUP  PORTABLE AND THE CLOSE AND CONSTANT CONFINEMENT  OF THE OTHERS LESS PREJUDICIAL AND FATAL TO THEIR HEALTH  AND LIFE IT IS TO BE LAMENTED THAT THEY ARE NOT  MORE GENERALLY MADE USE OF FOR NOTWITHSTANDING  THEIR ADVANTAGE IS APPARENT AND INCONTESTABLE IT  IS SCARCE CREDIBLE HOW FEW ARE TO BE FOUND AMONG  THE VAST NUMBER OF SHIPS DAILY EMPLOYED IN CAR  RYING PASSENGERS SLAVES CATTLE AND OTHER PERISH  ABLE COMMODITIES THOSE OF YOUR INVENTION  WHICH I HAD WERE OF SINGULAR SERVICE TO US THEY KEPT337  KEPT THE INSIDE OF THE SHIP COOL SWEET DRY AND  HEALTHY THE NUMBER OF SLAVES I BURIED WAS ONLY  FIX AND NOT ONE WHITE MAN OF OUR CREW WHICH  WAS THIRTYFOUR DURING A VOYAGE OF 15 MONTHS  AN INSTANCE VERY UNCOMMON THE 340 NEGROES  WERE VERY SENSIBLE OF THE BENEFITS OF A CONSTANT  VENTILATION AND WERE ALWAYS DISPLEASED WHEN IT  WAS OMITTED EVEN THE EXERCISE HAD ADVANTAGES  NOT TO BE DESPISED AMONG PEOPLE SO MUCH CONFINED  I MUST NOT HOWEVER FORGET THAT VENTILATION ALONE  IS INSUFFICIENT TO KEEP DISORDERS OUT OF SHIPS FOR  OFTEN INFECTIONS ARE BROUGHT ABOARD BY THE SLAVES  OR OTHERS AND FREQUENTLY DISEASES ARE PRODUCED  BY FEEDING ON BAD OR DECAYED FOOD BUT OFTENER  STILL BY INSOBRIETY FOR I HAVE EVER REMARKED THAT  THE IMMODERATE USE OF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS IN WARM  CLIMATES IS MORE PERNICIOUS AND FATAL EVEN THAN  THE MALIGNANCY OF THE AIR ITSELF IN COLD COUN  TRIES TOO WHERE I HAVE HAD EXPERIENCE THOSE FAIL  ORS OR OTHERS WHO ACCUSTOMED THEMSELVES TO HARD  DRINKING ESPECIALLY OF DRAMS HAD THE SCURVY IN  A TERRIBLE DEGREE WHEREAS THOSE WHO WERE TEM  PERATE OR SOBER EITHER ESCAPED IT INTIRELY OR HAD  IT BUT MODERATELY THE EFFECTS OF DRUNKENNESS  WERE STILL MORE DISCERNABLE AMONG THE INDIANS AD  JOINING OUR SETTLEMENTS IN HUDSONSBAY WHO ARE  A FEEBLE DIMINUTIVE CHILLY INDOLENT SET OF PEOPLE  ON THE CONTRARY THOSE WHO COME FROM THE INLAND  PARTS WHO ARE UNUSED TO DRINK BRANDY ARE BRAVE  ACTIVE ROBUST AND INDUSTRIOUS THE SAME DIF  FERENCE IS OBSERVABLE IN THE AFRICANS AND PERHAPS  AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF MOST OTHER NATIONS  DID WE ATTEND TO IT IT WAS TO THE UNUSUAL SO VOL 49 X X BRIETY338  BRIETY OF MY CREW THAT I ASCRIBED IN SOME MEA  SURE THEIR UNCOMMON HEALTHINESS FOR SAILORS  BREATHE A PURER AIR AND ENJOY MORE EXERCISE AND  LIBERTY THAN PASSENGERS OR SLAVES WHEREFORE THEIR  AILMENTS ARE OWING TO BAD OR DISORDERLY LIVING AS  WELL AS TO UNWHOLSOME AIR  COULD I BUT SEE THE IMMODERATE USE OF SPIRITUOUS  LIQUORS LESS GENERAL AND THE BENEFITS OF VENTILA  TORS MORE KNOWN AND EXPERIENCED I MIGHT THEN  HOPE TO SEE MANKIND BETTER AND HAPPIER I AM  S I R  YOUR MOST OBEDIENT SERVANT BRISTOL DEC 26 1753  HENRY ELLIS 49 AND BY THE LIKE GOOD CONDUCT IN HIS NEXT VOYAGE IN THE YEAR 1755 NOT ONE OF 312 SLAVES DIED AND ALL HIS 36 SAILORS ARRIVED ALIVE AND WELL AT BRISTOL 50 AND THE EARL OF HALIFAX HAS OFTEN INFORMED ME OF THE GREAT BENEFIT THEY FOUND BY THE USE OF VENTILATORS IN SEVERAL NOVA SCOTIA TRANSPORTSHIPS TWELVE TO ONE MORE HAVE BEEN FOUND TO DIE IN UN VENTILATED THAN IN VENTILATED SHIPS IT IS INDEED A SELFEVIDENT THING THAT THE CHANGING THE FOUL AIR FRE QUENTLY IN SHIPS IN WHICH THERE ARE MANY PERSONS WILL BE A MEANS OF KEEPING THEM IN BETTER HEALTH THAN NOT DOING IT WHICH MAKES IT THE MORE ASTONISH ING THAT EFFECTUAL PROPOSALS TO REMEDY SO GREAT AN EVIL SHOULD BE RECEIVED WITH SO MUCH COLDNESS AND INDIFFERENCE BY MANKIND THEY LITTLE CONSIDER THAT 5 IT339 IT IS THE HIGH DEGREE OF PUTREFACTION THAT MOST SUBTILE DISSOLVENT IN NATURE WHICH A FOUL AIR ACQUIRES IN LONG STAGNATING WHICH GIVES IT THAT PESTILENTIAL QUA LITY WHICH CAUSES WHAT IS CALLED THE GAOLDISTEMPER AND A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OR EVEN VAPOUR OF THIS HIGHLY ATTENUATED VENOM LIKE THE INFECTION OR INOCU LATION FOR THE SMALLPOX SOON SPREADS ITS DEADLY IN FECTION OUGHT NOT MEN THEREFORE FROM THE COM MON NATURAL PRINCIPLE OF SELFPRESERVATION TO USE THEIR UTMOST ENDEAVOURS TO SHUN THIS PESTILENT DE STROYER BY WHICH MILLIONS OF MANKIND HAVE PERISHED IN SHIPS LVI

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1102120,Bugg v Seay Jan 16 1908 60 S E 89,i245969,14 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER unanimous court says We are of opinion that the statute in tended to exempt all property which came to the wife by any other mode than through the husband from liability to seizure for his debts without regard to the nature of the interest which the husband may have in it or the time when it accrued and that in regard to such debts created after the passage of the law no principle of law or morals is violated by the enactment On the contrary if we concede as in the present case that the hus band had acquired a tenancy by curtesy in her property before such enactment it is eminently wise and just that no other per son should afterwards acquire such an interest in it as to dis turb the joint possession of it and turn the family resulting from the marriage out that it may go to pay his debts Hitz v Na tional Metropolitan Bank 111 U S 722 4 Sup Ct 613 28 L Ed 577 For these reasons we are of opinion that with respect to the judgments here asserted the act of March 1900 is valid and therefore they cannot be enforced against the property sought to he subjected in this proceeding The decree complained of must therefore be reversed and this court proceeding to enter such decree as the circuit court should have entered it is ordered that the bill be dismissed Reversed BUGG v

against George P Seay to recover 40 acres of land embraced within the boundaries given in a deed under which plaintiff claimed title From a judgment for defend ant plaintiff brings error Affirmed W BR Pettit  Sons for plaintiff in error J O Shepherd for defendant in error BUCHANAN J The plaintiff in error instituted his action of ejectment to recover a tract of 40 acres of land Upon the trial of the cause there was a verdict and judgment for the defendant To that judgment this writ of error was awarded One of the errors assigned is that the trial court ought to have set aside the verdict of the jury because contrary to the law and the evidence The defendant did not offer any evidence to sustain his plea of not guilty The plaintiff in his declaration referred to and de scribed the land which he sought to recover as being the same land mentioned and described in a deed from R B Seay the plaintiffs grantor to George P Seay the defendant dated the 30th day of December 1901 and of record in the clerks office of Fluvanna county court in Deed Book 30 page 227 1908 BUGG V SEAY 12114 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER That deed was not offered in evidence but seems to have been treated in the trial court as a part of the record and before the jury because referred to in the declaration The deed is copied into the record and in the briefs of counsel on both sides here is treated as part of the record but in oral argument the plaintiffs counsel insiste that it was no part of the record because not made so by bill of exceptions In the view we take of the case the same result will follow whether it was or was not before the jury If it be considered a part of the record then it appears that both parties claim under R B Seay that his conveyance to the defendant was executed on the 30th day of December 1901 and admitted to record on the 5th lay of December 1903 and that his Seays conveyance to the plaintiff was executed and admitted to record on the 22d lay of September 1902 The failure of the defendant to re corl his leeI until after the plaintiff had purchased the same land anid recortled his deed it is insisted by the plaintiff rendered the lefenlants leed voitl as to him uniler the provisions of section 2465 of the Code of 1887 Va Code 1904 p 1223 That section provides among other things that a deed con veying lanl shall be voil as to subsequent purchasers for valu able consileration without notice   until and except from the time it is atdmitted to record in the proper coiunty or corpora tion If a party claiming to be a purchaser of land for a valuable consideration without notice of a prior unrecorded conveyance can maintain an action of ejectment against the grantee therein he can only do so by showing that he received his conveyance andl actually paid the purchase money before he had notice of the prior unrecorded deed Such proof is necessary in a court of equity where the protection of a bona fide purchaser for value without notice is usually set up as a defense Lamars Exr z Hale 79 Va 147 and cases cited Wasserman z Metzger 105 Va 744 54 S E 893 7 L R A N S 1019 and cases cited 2 Min Inst 4th Ed 767 et seq 1 Perry on Trusts 5th Ed  219  and a fortiori less proof would not be required of the plaintiff in an action of ejectment seeking to recover the land in the possession of the grantee in the prior unrecorded conveyance The plaintiff introlduced in evidence his deed from R B Seay which recited tihat it was imade in consileration of the sum of 1050 the receipt of which is hereby acknowledgeld Viiile the recital in the leel was evidence of payment against the grantor in the leed it is not evidence on a question of this kinI to affect the rights of the grantee in the prior deed but the paymelnt must be shown independently of the recital in the leed As to such grantee the recital is hearsay June 122and none the less so because in writing and there is no reason why it should be evidence against a party who has no con nectionl with the deed Lloyd v Lynch 28 Pa 419 70 Ani Dec 137 140 1 Perry on Trusts 5th Ed  219 cited in Lamars Exr v Hale supra Henry v Raiman 1 Casey Pa at page 360 64 Am Dec 703 Snelgrove z Snelgrove 4 Desaus S C 287 note in Basset v Nosworthy 2 White  Tudors Lead Cas in Eq pt 1 p 100 Neither the evidence introduced by the plaintiff nor that offered by him which the court rejected tended to prove that he had paid a valuable consideration for the land If the deed referred to in the declaration be not considered as a part of the record then it does not appear that the plaintiff and defendant traced title to a common source and the burden was upon the plaintiff to trace his title to the commonwealth or in some other manner show that he was entitled to the possession of tlhe land sought to be recovered as against the defendant See Leftwich zv City of Richmond 100 Va 164 40 S E 651 Suttle v R F etc R Co 76 Va 284 Rhule z Seaboard etc Ry 102 Va 343 346 46 S E 331 Tapscott v Cobb 11 Gratt 172 The evidence offered by the plaintiff to sustain the issue on his part if the court had permitted it all to go to the jury would not have shown that he had title to the land in controversy nor would it have shown that he had any riglit to the possession thereof as against the defendant The verdict was therefore plainly right upon the evidence before the jury and no other ver dict could have been properly found upon the evidence offered by the plaintiff if the court hadpermitted it all to go to the jury This being so it is wholly unnecessary to consider the question whether or not the court erred as to the admissibility of the re jected evidence Neither is it necessary to consider the question whether the court erred in giving the instruction set out in the plaintiffs third bill of exception because as we have already seen the plaintiff in no view of the case which he made or offered to make was entitled to recover and therefore could not have been prejudiced by the instruction Wright v Bank 96 Va 728 32 S E 459 70 Am St Rep 889 and cases cited During the trial of the case and before the jury had retired to consider of their verdict in reply to the direct question of the plaintiffs counsel as to what the court would do if the jury found a verdict for the plaintiff after the parol eveidence had been ex cluded the judge replied from the bench that he would set aside the verdict This action of the court is assigned as error If this was error it was invited by the plaintiff and he will not I9081 BUGG V SEAY 12314 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER be permitted to complain of it here especially as it did him no in jury N  W Ry Co v Mann 99 Va 180 37 S E 849 We are of opinion that the judgment complained of should be affirmed Affirmed Note Our prediction in the annotation to Wasserman v Metzger 12 Va Law Reg 825 that the dissent in that case would detract somewhat from its binding effect is not being realized as the court cites and approves it in the principal case and again decides that in order to constitute one a purchaser for value and without notice he must have paid the purchase money before notice ROCHESTER GERMAN INS Co V

booty for the law leaves parties to an illegal transaction in the situation it finds theml The robber is thrown out of court not because he is a professional lawbreaker2 but because he is attempting to enforce an unlawful agreement To justify withholding legal redress then from an applicant  trust it must not only appear that the plaintiff is or represents a combination created and usually acting in illegal restraint of trade but the particular right sued on must have arisen from be incidental to or directly further the illegal scheme8 Thus that the plaintiff is a  trust is no defense to suits for infringement of a patent4 to foreclose a mortgage5 to enforce a surety liability6 to recover possession of property once acquired under an unlawful contract7 to reach the proceeds of sales in the hands of an agent8 and to recover for services rendered9 and for goods sold0 Apparently it is not sufficient that the con 1 Everet v Williams 9 L Quar Rev 105 197 2 Taylor v Bell Soap Co 45 N Y Supp

discussion to contracts was made in the course of the trusts usual business however unlawful the trust or the business the contract requires more direct contact with illegality to be tainted1l Some light on this necessarily vague topic is thrown by a recent holding of the Supreme Court The plaintiff trust had contracted with the defend ant jobber to sell and the jobbing company had agreed to buy all the wall paper required by it in its business for a year subject to prices and terms specified The defendant gave several orders which were filled but when sued for the price pleaded illegality and was sustained by a majority of the court Continental Wall Paper Co v Voight  Sons Co U S Sup Ct Feb I I909 A previous holding 3 is distinguished on the ground that there the purchaser was under no general contract to buy and hence the specific sales sued on had no direct connection with an illegal contract or scheme This distinction suggests two tests that a contract will not be enforced when the plaintiffs case must disclose an unlawful transactionl2 or when the contract is an inseparable part of such a transaction The former has been justly criticized as too narrow 1 thus it is immaterial in the principal case that the plaintiff must refer to the previous unlawful contract for terms and prices as is pointed out by the minority But the minority opinion goes on broadly to state that a purchase may be lawful though it is the fulfilment of an unlawful contract in other words that the sales in question were not bad  from the outside This is not the way the Supreme Court treats separate sales when the question is whether they constitute interstate commerce then the single act is said to derive its flavor from the nature of the whole congeriesl4 Perhaps a sale may constitute an element of actionable damage as a tortious act and yet be in itself a valid contract5 Nevertheless when as in the principal case the specific contracts were contemplated by are the fulfilment of and are connected as parts of an entire scheme to the previous unlawful agreement it is hard to agree with the minority The test of separability is indeed vague but it seems certain enough to invalidate the contracts in question On this ground that the court could not help the plaintiff without furthering an illegal scheme16 a trust was not allowed to sue for infringement of a patent17 to replevy propertyl8 or to recover the price of goods sold19 Nor should the court in deciding the legality of such contracts of sale consider the irrelevant facts that the plaintiff will have no quasicontractual alternative20 that the defendant has received the benefits21 or that an innocent defendant might recover against the trust in the converse case22 11 Walds Pollcck Contracts 3d

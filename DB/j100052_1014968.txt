J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1014968,THE PROGRAM AND ACTIVITIES OF THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC WELFARE COUNCIL,I242694,THE PROGRAM AND ACTIVITIES OF THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC WELFARE COUNCIL BY REV R A MCGOWAN ASSISTANT DIRECTOR SOCIAL ACTION DEPARTMENT NATIONAL CATHOLIC WELFARE COUNCIL T HE LABOR PROGRAM OF THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC WELFARE COUNCIL IS BASED UPON THE PROGRAM OF SOCIAL RECONSTRUC TION WHICH WAS ISSUED BY THE BISHOPS WHO ADMINISTERED THE NATIONAL CATHO LIC WAR COUNCIL AND UPON THE SECTION ENTITLED INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS IN THE PASTORAL LETTER OF THE AMERICAN HIER ARCHY THE FIRST OF THESE IS THE MORE FAMOUS AND HAS COME TO BE KNOWN AS THE BISHOPS PROGRAM THE PASTORAL LETTER CONTAINS FEWER DETAILS THAN THE BISHOPS PROGRAM BUT THE SALIENT PRINCIPLES OF BOTH ARE THE SAME WAGES BOTH INSIST UPON THE FAMILY LIVING WAGE WHICH INCLUDES ACCORDING TO THE PASTORAL LETTER NOT MERELY DECENT MAINTENANCE FOR THE PRESENT BUT ALSO A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR SUCH FUTURE NEEDS AS SICKNESS INVALIDITY AND OLD AGE THE BISHOPS PROGRAM SAYS THAT THE LABORERS RIGHT TO A LIVING WAGE IS THE FIRST MORAL CHARGE UPON INDUSTRY AND THAT WHILE THE EMPLOYER HAS A RIGHT TO GET A REASONABLE LIVING OUT OF HIS BUSINESS HE HAS NO RIGHT TO IN TEREST UNTIL HIS EMPLOYEES HAVE OB TAINED AT LEAST LIVING WAGES THE BISHOPS PROGRAM EMPHASIZES THATTHIS IS ONLY THE MINIMUM OF JUSTICE IT URGES THAT THE GENERAL LEVEL OF WAGES REACHED AT THE END OF THE WAR SHOULD NOT BE LOWERED FIRST BECAUSE BEFORE THE WAR A CONSIDERABLE MAJORITY WERE NOT MAKING LIVING WAGES SECOND BECAUSE WAGES DID NOT INCREASE FASTER THAN THE COST OF LIVING THIRD BECAUSE A LIVING WAGE IS NOT THE FULL MEASURE OF JUSTICE AND FOURTH BECAUSE IT IS ECONOMICALLY SOUNDER AND HUMANLY FAIRER TO PAY BETTER THAN LIVING WAGES IN A COUNTRY AS RICH AS OURS AS REGARDS WOMEN WORKERS THE BISHOPS PROGRAM SAYS THAT THOSE WOMEN WHO ARE ENGAGED AT THE SAME TASKS AS MEN SHOULD RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL AMOUNTS AND QUALITIES OF WORK IT ADDS THAT THE PROPORTION OF WOMEN IN INDUSTRY SHOULD BE REDUCED TO THE SMALLEST PRACTICABLE LIMITS UNIONS THE PASTORAL LETTER REAFFIRMS THE RIGHT OF THE WORKERS TO FORM AND MAIN TAIN THE KIND OF ORGANIZATION THAT IS NECESSARY AND THAT WILL BE MOST EFFEC TUAL IN SERVING THEIR WELFARE THE SLIGHTLY BUT NOT MATERIALLY CHANGED FORM FOUND IN THE SUMMARY OF THE BISHOPS PROGRAM EXPRESSES THE HOPE THAT THE RIGHT OF LABOR TO ORGANIZE AND DEAL WITH EMPLOYERS THROUGH CHOSEN REPRESENTATIVES WILL NEVER AGAIN BE CALLED INTO QUESTION BY ANY CONSIDER ABLE NUMBER OF EMPLOYERS LABOR UNIONS ACCORDING TO THE PASTORAL LET TER HAVE BEEN AND STILL ARE NECESSARY IN THE STRUGGLE OF THE WORKERS FOR FAIR WAGES AND FAIR CONDITIONS OF EMPLOY MENT CONCILIATION AND ARBITRATION ISSUED SHORTLY AFTER THE ARMISTICE THE BISHOPS PROGRAM URGED THAT THE WAR LABOR BOARD BE RETAINED AS AN INSTRUMENT FOR SECURING A MEASURE OF INDUSTRIAL PEACE ITS PRINCIPLES METH ODS AND RESULTS CONSTITUTED IT WAS DE CLARED A DEFINITE AND FARREACHING GAIN FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE THE PASTORAL LETTER INSISTS ESPECIALLY UPON INDUSTRIAL ARBITRATION A DISPUTE IT READS 130THE NATIONAL CATHOLIC WELFARE COUNCIL THAT CANNOT BE ADJUSTED BY DIRECT NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES CON CERNED SHOULD ALWAYS BE SUBMITTED TO ARBITRATION WORKS COUNCILS AS A MEANS OF ESTABLISHING GREATER PEACE BETWEEN EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES THE PASTORAL LETTER RECOMMENDS THAT LABOR UNIONS SHOULD BE SUPPLEMENTED BY ASSOCIATIONS OR CONFERENCES COM POSED JOINTLY OF EMPLOYERS AND EM PLOYEES WHICH WILL PLACE EMPHASIS UPON THE COMMON INTERESTS RATHER THAN THE DIVERGENT AIMS OF THE TWO PARTIES UPON COIPERATION RATHER THAN CONFLICT THE COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH THEY CAN UNITE IS DECLARED TO BE THOSE MATTERS OF INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT WHICH DI RECTLY CONCERN THE EMPLOYEE AND ABOUT WHICH HE POSSESSES HELPFUL KNOWLEDGE THE BISHOPS PROGRAM BRINGS FORWARD THE SAME RECOMMENDATION IT SAYS THAT LABOR OUGHT GRADUALLY TO RECEIVE A GREATER REPRESENTATION IN THE INDUS TRIAL PART OF BUSINESS MANAGEMENT THE CONTROL OF PROCESSES AND MACHINERY NATURE OF PRODUCT ENGAGEMENT AND DIS MISSAL OF EMPLOYEES HOURS OF WORK RATES OF PAY BONUSES ETC WELFARE WORK SHOP DISCIPLINE RELATIONS WITH TRADE UNIONS IN EFFECT BOTH THE PASTORAL LETTER AND THE BISHOPS PRO GRAM ADVOCATE THAT IN ADDITION TO THE INFLUENCE WHICH WORKING PEOPLE POSSESS THROUGH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING THEY SHOULD SHARE IN THE INDUSTRIAL MANAGE MENT THE PASTORAL LETTER SAYS THAT THIS WOULD BENEFIT THE WORKERS THE EMPLOYERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC SOCIAL LEGISLATION WHILE THE PASTORAL LETTER INCLUDES LEGISLATION AS ONE OF THE METHODS OF RIGHTING SOCIAL WRONGS IT DOES NOT AD VOCATE ANY PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLA TION THE BISHOPS PROGRAM ON THE OTHER HAND RECOMMENDS A FARREACHING PROGRAM OF SOCIAL LEGISLATION INCLUDING MINIMUMWAGE LAWS SOCIAL INSURANCE FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT BUREAUS MUNICIPAL HOUSING ETC ON THE LIVINGWAGE LAW IT SAYS THAT THE SEVERAL STATES SHOULD ENACT LAWS PROVIDING FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF WAGE RATES THAT WILL BE AT LEAST SUFFICIENT FOR THE DECENT MAINTENANCE OF A FAMILY IN THE CASE OF ALL MALE ADULTS AND ADE QUATE TO THE DECENT INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT OF FEMALE WORKERS ULTIMATELY THE LEGAL WAGE RATE SHOULD BE A SAVING WAGE AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR FUTURE CONTINGENCIES MEAN WHILE SOCIAL INSURANCE SHOULD PROVIDE FOR ILLNESS INVALIDITY UNEMPLOYMENT AND OLD AGE TO SUCH AN INSURANCE FUND THE STATE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE VERY LITTLE AND THAT MUCH ONLY TEMPORARILY AND WORKINGMEN SHOULD CONTRIBUTE NOTHING UNLESS THEY ARE MAKING ENOUGH ALREADY TO MEET THE PRESENT NEEDS OF A FAMILY THE FUND SHOULD BE RAISED BY A LEVY ON INDUSTRY FOR THE INDUSTRY IN WHICH A MAN IS EMPLOYED SHOULD PRO VIDE HIM WITH ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO MEET ALL THE NEEDS OF HIS ENTIRE LIFE THE GUILD SYSTEM THE PASTORAL LETTER IN ITS SECTION ON INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS DOES NOT MENTION EXCEPT BY IMPLICATION SOCIALISM OR COMMON OWNERSHIP A SHORT PASSAGE IS ALL THAT IS GIVEN TO IT IN THE BISHOPS PROGRAM WHERE IT SAYS THAT SOCIALISM WILL PROBABLY NEVER COME AND IF IT DOES IT WILL MEAN BUREAUCRACY POLITI CAL TYRANNY ETC INSTEAD BOTH THE PASTORAL LETTER AND THE BISHOPS PRO GRAM INSIST UPON A SOUND AND DEEP RE FORM OF PRIVATE OWNERSHIP ALONG THE LINES OF THE GUILD SYSTEM OF THE MIDDLE AGES THE HEART OF THE RECOMMENDATION IN THE WORDS OF THE BISHOPS PROGRAM IS THIS THE MAJORITY MUST SOMEHOW BE COME OWNERS OR AT LEAST IN PART OF THE INSTRUMENTS OF PRODUCTION THE MA 131THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY JORITY OF THE WORKERS ARE NOT TO REMAIN MERE WAGEEARNERS TO A GREAT EXTENT THE ABOLITION OF THE WAGE SYS TEM IS INVOLVED AND UNTIL THIS SITUA TION IS REACHED WE CANNOT HAVE A THOROUGHLY EFFICIENT SYSTEM OF PRODUC TION OR AN INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL ORDER THAT WILL BE SECURE FROM THE DANGER OF REVOLUTION THE PASTORAL LETTER APPROACHES THE QUESTION FROM ANOTHER ANGLE TO REACH THE SAME CONCLUSION IT IS SEEKING A REMEDY FOR THE DIVISION OF SOCIETY INTO TWO WIDELY DIFFERING CASTES OF WHICH ONE HOLDS POWER BECAUSE IT HOLDS WEALTH WHILE THE OTHER IS THE NEEDY AND POWERLESS MULTITUDE FOLLOWING POPE LEOS RECOMMENDATION AND THE SPIRIT OF THE CHURCH IN BUILDING UP THE GUILDS OF THE MIDDLE AGES THE PASTORAL LETTER SAYS THAT THE UNDERLYING PRINCI PLE OF THE ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES IS OF PERMANENT AP PLICATION AND IS THE ONLY ONE THAT WILL GIVE STABILITY TO INDUSTRIAL SOCIETY IT SAYS FURTHER THAT THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLE OF THE ECONOMIC ARRANGEMENTS OF THE MIDDLE AGES WAS THAT THE PERSONS WHO WORKED OWNED THE LANDS AND THE TOOLS WITH WHICH THEY WORKED THE BISHOPS PROGRAM POINTS OUT THAT THE WORKING PEOPLE CAN BE ENABLED TO REACH THE STAGE OF OWNERSHIP THROUGH COOPERATIVE PRODUCTIVE SOCIETIES AND COPARTNERSHIP ARRANGEMENTS THE PAS TORAL LETTER DOES NOT INDICATE ANY SPE CIFIC METHOD IT CONTENTS ITSELF WITH URGING THAT THE DESIRED CHANGES BE REALIZED AS RAPIDLY AS CONDITIONS WILL PERMIT ACTIVITIES LABOR MATTERS ARE ENTRUSTED BY THE

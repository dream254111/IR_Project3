j100077,The American Political Science Review,1946853,Legislatures and Foreign Relations,i333508,LEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS DENYS P MYERS In a previous paper foreign relations as a phase of govern mental activity were considered chiefly as an international phenomenon Such relations were there discussed largely in their political bearing and some attempt was made to deduce from practice the considerations which affect foreign offices and the conditions encountered by diplomatic personnel The problems of secrecy in negotiations and of secret treaties were examined and an effort made to indicate how much knowledge of both may be justifiably concealed The present paper is a study of legislative control over foreign relations Systems of legislative handling of foreign relations may be distinguished as of three types which we may designate as the continental the executive and the American The American type is characterized by an imposed agreement between the executive and legislative departments of government before treaties can become binding upon the state The continental type is characterized by a less complete dependence of the execu tive upon the legislative department in respect to treaty ratifi cation The executive type is characterized by an almost com plete independence of the executive respecting treaty ratification All systems recognize definitely that the conduct of foreign relations is an executive function None denies the patent facts that it is the place of the executive to speak and act for the state and that in all matters not definable as legislation the minister can definitely bind the state Innumerable decisions under all systems are reached by the department of foreign affairs without any but the executive branch of the government knowing anything of them until they are recorded facts Even where diplomatic correspondence is regularly and ex tensively published it is fairly innocent in appearance What 643644 THE AMERICAN POLITXCAL SCIENCE REVIEW is not said is usually more important than what is and the real actuating motives of policy in a given case are seldom officially set down in type anywhere If what lies behind must be known the secret session of a legislature or of its committee or a verbal conversation is resorted to everywhere Such methodsbeing universalmust have reason behind them for they are prac ticed by the most radical democracies even more than under the autocratic procedure which is being widely criticized There is little similarity in practice respecting the elements of foreign relations which come before legislatures The British parliament probably exerts much influence on policy In several European countries foreign policy sometimes becomes a factor in the political defeat of ministries under the cabinet system In PanAmerica including the United States legis lative influence on foreign policy is very slight On the other hand it will be found that legislative connec tions with foreign relations are somewhat associated in most systems with warmaking The connection is closer or more remote as the system is based upon European historical founda tions which formerly considered the conduct of foreign relations as subordinate to warmaking The conspectus appearing at the end of this paper indicates in an imperfect way the conditions existing as a result of consti tutional provisions and of executive or legislative practice Such a tabulation cannot be entirely scientific because in dif ferent states identical practices are modified in action and at different periods Moreover in one state a stipulated method may be extensively employed while in another the same method though stipulated may be seldom used Ministerial discretion in relation to parliamentary intervention is also a widely vary ing circumstance The Swedish system for instance is at first sight much less responsible to the Riksdag than is the American one to congress Yet in Sweden at the remiss debate any member may ask that the conduct of any minister be referred for consideration to the constitution committee which is a joint committee of twenty members elected by the proportional method from both houses The committee cannot suppress aLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 645 motion on foreign affairs though this must be referred to the committee before a vote Then if the house decides in the affirmative the minister must answer the interpellation on which debate may occur but without a vote Thus any ques tion relating to foreign affairs can be forced into discussion by purely legislative decisions In the United States the congress can call upon the President only for information which is fur nished by the secretary of state for transmission if not incom patible with the public interest Behind the use of this phrase and the frequent refusal of information as a result many legiti mate reasons may lie None but executive discretion controls the publication of documents in the annual Foreign Relations volume which was issued as a house of representatives docu ment up to 19051 and only executive discretion determines when the volume shall be issued its appearance at present being delayed six years after the twelvemonth with which it deals Thus variations in detail of national systems render bald de scriptive terms inaccurate as a basis of conclusions It is consequently necessary as well as desirable for the clear understanding of the actualities dealt with to sketch in succes sion what have been indicated to be the three distinct types of conduct of foreign relations Since the practice of foreign rela tions as a generic element in government began in Europe and because international politics has always been dominated by the great powers a historic logic will be obvious in the experiences of the European states THE CONTINENTAL TYPE The continental is the most complicated system and can be best appreciated by keeping constantly in mind that foreign affairs were originally the sole prerogative of the ruler and that the modifications of that prerogative were brought about by the assertion of popular rights through legislative channels The French system is chosen to illustrate the type because of the extraordinary constitutional history of the country I Since 1905 it has borne the seal of the department of state646 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Democracy burst forth in Europe as a system of government rather than a condition in the French Revolution of 1789 Even before then the Ptatsgfeneraux held an exceptional position on the continent of Europe After that date until the constitu tional laws of 1875 France alternately monarchy and republic had fourteen different constitutions Nowhere else in Europe has there been a better laboratory of political science The fact that the constitutional laws of 1875 have lasted for forty two years indicates the attainment of stability The law of July 16 1875 sur les rapports des pouvoirs publicsthe pro vision adopted after a unique constitutional experienceindi cates what was deemed safe and workable It provides Article 8 The president of the Republic negotiates and ratifies treaties He gives the chambers information concern ing them as soon as the interest and safety of the state permit Treaties of peace of commerce treaties which engage the finances of the state those which are relative to the status of persons and to the right of property of Frenchmen abroad are definitive only after having been voted by the two chambers No cession no exchange no annexation of territory may take place except by virtue of a law Article 9 The president of the Republic may not declare war without the previous assent of the two chambers2 The constitutional law of February 25 1875 relative a lorganisation des pouvoirs publics contains the following Article 6 The ministers are conjointly responsible before the chambers for the general policy of the government and individually for their personal acts 2 The French text reads Article 8 Le president de la 116publique negocie et ratifie les traits II en donne connaissance aux Chambres aussitt que 1intrt et la saret6 de lEtat le permettent Les traits de paix de commerce les traits qui engagent les finances de Mutat ceux qui sont relatifs A Itat des personnel et au droit de proprit6

president de la lt6publique ne peut declarer la guerre sans las sentiment pr6alable des deux ChambresLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 647 The president of the Republic is responsible only in the case of high treason3 A mere glance at these provisions shows that the constitu tional system for the conduct of foreign relations in France takes no cognizance of policy and does not attempt to interfere with diplomatic action The following are details of parlia mentary control over treatymaking 4 1 The chambers may specifically authorize the executive to conclude treaties thus waiving their right to pass upon a docu ment which otherwise would come before them In this case the legislative department fixes a policy within its constitutional control 2 On the other hand executive freedom of action cannot be restrained by legislation regulating matters to be made the sub ject of future treaties In this case is recognized the impotence of the legislative department to dictate to the executive in matters which the latter must freely agree upon with a third party a foreign government 3 The chambers do not presume to revise the text of a treaty Where they act they pass a law approving the treaty text in tegrally annexed thereto The apparent reason is that the legislative department does not assume to dictate specifically what must be negotiated but confines itself to stating definitely what it does accept or in a converse case what it does not accept 4 Treaties involving a modification of territory must be approved by the chambers The soundness of the provision is evident when one recalls that changes in territory involve changes in population and therefore in the status of citizens Approval 3The French text reads Article 6 Les ministres sont solidairement responsables devant les Chambres de la politique g6n6rale du gouvernement et individuellement de leurs actes personnels  Le president de la R6publique nest responsable que dans le cas de haute

Barisien Le Parlement  les trait ttude sur le fonctionnement pratique de la loi du 18 juillet 1875 Art 8 Paris Arthur Rousseau 1913648 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW must be had both for acquisition and for relinquishment of territory but in practice the constitutional law is not construed to include pseudoprotectorates which in the words of Frantz Despagnet are only disguised occupations as they are equiva lent to an extension of sovereignty Such treaties have been chiefly negotiated with African and other tribes Barisien found fortyfive such treaties not submitted to the chambers and but one which was In the latter case action by the cham bers seems to have been a method of making engagements taken in the name of France by a French explorer governmentally regular On the other hand treaties of delimitation which are usually negotiated with European metropoles are submitted to the chambers with rare exceptions Barisien lists sixteen so submitted 5 Treaties of peace must be approved by the chambers This provision is apparently based objectively on the supposi tion that the state being a victor there would be acquisition of territory and the state being defeated there would be relin quishment of territory or an indemnity Cf No 7 6 Treaties of commerce including their most frequent form of treaties of friendship commerce and navigation must be approved by the chambers Treaties of an accessory character are subject to the same condition The apparent reason is that commercial matters are primarily a legislative consideration and that the executive in negotiating treaties of commerce essentially acts as direct agent of another department of government 7 Treaties engaging the finances of the state must be ap proved by the chambers This provision is interpreted as relating to treaties which can be executed only by engaging the finances of the state Its scope in practice has been held to include loan telegraphic postal postal moneyorder parcels post and monetary conventions The evident reason is that control of the public moneys rests with the legislative branch of the government 8 Treaties relative to the status of French persons abroad must be approved by the chambers This provision apparently found its way into the constitutional law on account of the casualLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 649 circumstance that at the time 1875 certain treaties of the category were pending The opinion of French publicists shows a trend against considering extradition treaties as sub ject to approval 9 Treaties relative to the property rights of Frenchmen abroad must be approved by the chambers Municipal legis lation respecting foreigners is an essential attribute of the cham bers and this provision seems to have contemplated that the chambers by approving treaties defining property rights of Frenchmen abroad would thereby become obligated to recipro cate legislatively for foreigners in France 10 Treaties of arbitration and arbitral compromis are as similated to treaties requiring approval by the chambers if the powers of the arbitrators exceed those of a judge or if they relate to the previous categories of subjects 11 Articles of treaties not as a whole falling within the above categories must be approved by the chambers These are usually treaties engaging the state to international adminis trative regulations or tending to secure uniform practice Munic ipal laws must be changed to conform or new laws passed and it obviously makes for harmony to have both the international and national phases of the problem acted upon by the legisla tive branch of the government Treaties which do not require approval by the chambers are 1 Extradition treaties on which there is dispute but on which opinion tends to this conclusion 2 Administrative treaties by which term is understood those relating particularly to the fixation of various documentary forms and those relating to the manner or method of conducting affairs which originate in one country and are completed in another 3 Political treaties of all kinds unless they fall in whole or in part within the categories enumerated above 4 Treaties of alliance 5 All treaties until both the interest and the safety of the state permit their transmission to the chambers This sub stantive constitutional provision leaves it to executive discretion650 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW when any treaty shall be brought to the knowledge of the cham bers For treaties not requiring approval by the chambers it therefore legalizes and regularizes socalled secret treaties Substantially this system obtains in all the states of Europe except AustriaHungary Great Britain Russia Portugal and Switzerland In so far as this continental system relates to treaties it is probably the most fluid system It leaves political treaties within the control of the executive which however is dependent upon a parliamentary majority for its tenure of power Politi cal treaties and policies not embodied in treaties are therefore subject to popular control for no cabinet will deliberately adopt policies or political alignments that would result in its own de feat Questions of policy are things of delicate nuance and it is the cabineta small body of men closely in touch with con ditionsrather than the legislaturea large body of men in capable of reaching careful conclusions on subjects of pure reasonwhich is intrusted with appreciating what political theory is best at a given moment for the state to adopt in its foreign relations5 Most nonpolitical treaties on the other hand and those engagements affecting attributes of the sover eignty for which the legislature is primarily responsible depend upon its approval Such treaties invariably affect the citizen or depend upon legislation for their effectiveness Political treaties are engagements of the state as a collective entity and as such are logically concluded by an organ representing the collectivity Nonpolitical treaties on the other hand are en gagements on behalf of the individuals who make up the state and as such logically require for their conclusion and internal force the assistance and consent of an organ representing the individuals This seems to be the explanation of the distinction customary in what we are terming the continental system which 6 A legislature it is true often reaches decisions involving very delicate dis tinctions but these are not in the domain of pure reasoning They are possible because of the representation of numerous physical interests all of which being heard equally a delicate resultant of forces emerges in the decisionsLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 651 respecting treaties according to Ebreu5 is the most satisfactory system This continental system viewed as a system of diplomacy employs a more or less hereditary body of diplomats and throughout their activities historical habits color public business European archivesand this applies aU over the continent are too full of dead precedents imperfectly sloughed off One instance will suffice The ambassador began life in Europe as a cross between a plenipotentiary and a privileged spy He wrote home interminable letters of gossip and business and fearridden speculation and he served to support thereby the now obsolete system of enmity All European diplomatic business was con ducted with a precision of detail and a slavish following of forms that can be equalled only by the rarefication of idiocy which too often characterizes American municipal court procedure Great improvements in this respect have taken place in European diplomacy but it is not many years since a European publicist commented to an American that the annual volume of Foreign Relations interested and instructed him more than any other such publication because of the freedom and originality with which questions were treated7 European policy has been similarly trammeled by historical considerations and the machinery for handling the conduct of foreign relations described here as the continental system has not radically affected the condition The general tendency of the last few decades toward objectivity and the emergence of new political problems of a purely modern character in foreign relations have been the principal levers effecting change This process had caused many improvements before the war and the new political conditions after it will certainly accelerate funda mental betterments 6 Henri Ebreu Le Droit de trailer dans ses rapports avec la forme de 19tat et avec la forme du gouvernernent Valence 1900 T Cited by John Bassett Moore in A Brief Sketch of the Life of Francis WVhalrton prefixed to Whartons Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence 1 xv652 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW THE EXECUTIVE TYPE The executive type of the conduct of foreign relations has been less affected by parliamentary institutions than any other Yet the differences are at first sight not connected with foreign affairs Systems of handling treaties of taking cabinet decisions training and appointing diplomats publishing documents etc may be almost identical and yet the systems as a whole will fall into different categories If one should attempt to lay down a rule that would serve to test the systems indicated it would probably be found in answering the question where the sover eignty8 of the state centers The practical answer to this ques tion is a matter capable of much technical disputation and there is no single criterion for determining it WXhere there is a con stitutional legislature a tendency will be found to make it sov ereigntys residing place and this is a normal trend because it is the people from whom sovereignty emanates and who decide what agent of government shall exercise its attributes A sovereign people is strongly tempted to make all delegation of sovereign power as direct as possible but it must be borne in mind that power is not necessarily better exercised for being employed at its source In fact every constitution complicates the problem of determining in detail the distribution of sov ereign powers The executive system of government will therefore be found to be the simplest of all but it exists in its pure form in no con siderable modern state Abyssinia Afghanistan Persia and Siam are current instances Japan represents a transitional stage in which legislation is popular but in which most 8 Sovereignty is in this case internal sovereignty not the external sovereignty of international law For our purpose the theoretical origin of sovereignty in the people is not so important as what organ of the government actually and effectively represents the people as their sovereign agent Very useful discus sions

RELATIONS 653 other functions are left to the chief of the state9 Germany represents a slightly further development complicated by local and historical considerations Great Britain represents a stage in the transference 6f sovereignty to the people that is really complete as to theory but is in many respects not evident as to form Thoroughly to appreciate the executive type of foreign relations therefore it will be convenient to examine the methods of Russia Germany and Great Britain as typical of various stages of the executive type As legislation the first function of government is the first to be affected by direct popular action so foreign relations is the last and the least capable of useful popular control Russia before the March 1917 revolution presented the executive type in a fairly pure form By sections 12 and 13 of the Russian fundamental laws the tsar was supreme respecting all relations of the empire with foreign powers To him wag reserved the management of foreign policy he declared war concluded peace and concluded treaties with foreign powers These prerogatives were jealously guarded and were excluded from the competence of the duma Interpellation according to the manifesto of August 19 1905 was subject to the follow ing provisions Section 6 57 Notices of interpellationS regarding an alleged infringement of the law by ministers chiefs of departments or subordinate officials must be signed by at least thirty members of the duma and handed to the president who shall submit them to a plenary session 58 If the majority approve the interpellation it shall be communicated to the minister or chief of department concerned 60 Ministers or chiefs of departments shall reply within one month of the receipt of interpellations either giving explana tions or intimating why it would be impossible to do so10 I Turkey cannot be called exactly in a transitional stage for it is not certain that popular government will develop normally in that state Nor can the sultan be considered as entirely sovereign since he is subordinate both to the Koran and the Sheri or sacred law which fetwas can only interpret not alter 10 London Times weekly edition 1905 page 533654 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW It will be noticed that the minister must reply to an inter pellation concerning an alleged infringement of law Foreign relations were however customarily discussed in the duma only when the budget of the ministry of foreign affairs was presented by the budget commission The duma possessed the power of refusing to vote a budget credit for the ministry Sir George W Buchanan stated that the foreign minister can make a statement on foreign policy only by special command of the emperor It would seem then that the tsar had complete control of foreign relations with the exceptions of depending upon the legislative body for the necessary funds and of the necessity of satisfying the same body that laws had not been infringed Much more complicated is the German system This is partly due to the circumstance that the empire was built around Prussia including the Prussian constitution and partly due to the political theories of Bismarck which included the idea of divine right It is a system designed to attain results rather than to obey any logical tenet of political science The real responsibility or lack thereof is to be found in the constitution Article 11 The presidency of the federation is vested in the king of Prussia who bears the name of German Emperor The Emperor shall represent the Empire among nations declare war and conclude peace in the name of the same enter into alliances and other conventions with foreign countries accredit and receive ambassadors For a declaration of war in the name of the Empire the consent of the Federal Council shall be required except in case of an attack upon the territory of the Confederation or its coasts Article 15 The Chancellor of the Empire who shall be appointed by the Emperor shall be chairman of the Federal Council and shall conduct its business 11 Treatment of International Questions by Parliaments etc British Parlia mentary Papers Miscellaneous No 5 1912 page 21 Evidences of radical changes in the Russian constitutional system soon to take place are furnished by the recent crises and revolutionary overturnLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 655 Article 17 The commands and demands of the Emperor shall be issued in the name of the Empire and require for their validity the signature of the Chancellor who thereby assumes the responsibility It takes no imagination to picture the situation opened up by these provisions and actually in operation Germany has not a representative system for the conduct of foreign relations On the other hand the system is not of a purely executive type for this implies strictly a ministers sole responsibility to the ruler As a matter of fact political scientists have never agreed where the internal exercise of sovereignty resides in the German empire Many constitutional peculiarities render that prob lem extremely debatable but it is certain that the conduct of foreign relations is an attribute of the chancellor and that re sponsibility respecting such relations is found wherever his authority originates Now the chancellor is at once the agent of the Bundesrath which represents states of the empire and the appointed subordinate of the emperor The minister for foreign affairs is in turn subordinate to the chancellor and is simply his representative The chancellor is also customarily prime minister of Prussia and Prussian minister for foreign affairs the emperor is constitutionally king of Prussia the dominant and principal state of the empire and the imperial secretary of state for foreign affairs is ex officio a Prussian minis ter of state Pursuing the analysis further it appears that this Prussian body of ministers lacks cohesion as a cabinet and is responsible as individuals only to the king3 who is by virtue of office German emperor Going in another direction we find that foreign relations are decentralized in respect to intervention in them by the Bundes rath It was due to Bismarck that the only federal minister is 12 A theory not yet put forward so far as I know and worthy of consideration is that the sovereignty of the German Empire resides in the praesidium which forms the subject of Part IV Articles 1119 of the constitution This theory would place the sovereignty jointly in the president of the confederation and the chancellor 13 A Lawrence Lowell Government and Parties in Continental Europe I 288 292656 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the chancellor who has subordinates but no colleagues His plan was to give the Bundesrath general control of imperial affairs except military and foreign Though Bismarck did not succeed in having this plan adopted in form it really indicates the substantial practice The Bundesrath constitutionally organizes seven permanent committees from its own members and an additional one of which Article 8 of the constitution speaks as follows Besides there shall be appointed in the Federal Council a committee on foreign affairs over which Bavaria shall preside to be composed of the plenipotentiaries of the Kingdoms of Bavaria Saxony and Wurtemburg and of two plenipotentiaries of other States of the Empire who shall be elected annually by the Federal Council It will be observed that Prussia does not possess any definite position in this committee although it is that state in which the actual conduct of foreign relations is vested Some idea of the importance of the committee can be gained from the fact that for thirtyfive years the committee was never convened and that from 1871 to 1908 only two meetings were held Since the domestic crisis of 1908 Bavaria has established the practice of convening the committee in connection with any question of great magnitude and lasting public interest It has met regu larly during the period of the European war The proceedings are confidential and unanimity seems to prevail Parliamentary procedure scarcely affects the executives con trol of foreign relations in practice Questions may be referred to the budget committee of the Reichstag which consists of twentyeight members appointed by leaders of the various par ties Neither this committee nor its subcommittees can send for persons papers or records but must ask the president of the Reichstag to do this but ministers can always make statements to the committee and regularly do The committees reporter makes a verbal report to the Reichstag Proceedings are secret but reports of the sittings are issued Interpellations in the Reichstag are not mandatory on the chancellor and his subordi nates An interpellation must be signed by at least thirty memLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 657 bers and when it is reached on the order of the day the president of the Reichstag asks the chancellor whether and when he will answer If the reply is affirmative the interpellator delivers a speech and a reply is given with a debate following if fifty members so desire No motion on the subject of the interpel lation was permissible until 1913 Motions on any subject can however be tabled if signed by fifteen members and votes thereon are taken after debate Knowledge of the fact that a motion carried has value only as an academic expression of opinion and that neither the chancellor nor his representative will attend or take part in critical debates invariably checks criticism 14 It may be ventured that the constitution of the German Empire was not struck off for itself but rather was drawn up to conform to the constitution of Prussia and to leave Prussias power intact5 Many idiosyncrasies in it become logical when that fact is kept in mind Only two changes affecting the con luct of foreign relations have taken place One is the occasional functioning of the committee for foreign affairs of the Bundes rath within the last ten or dozen years Another is an amend inent of December 5 1911 to the colonial law Schiitzgebietgesetz of July 25 1900 The Bundesgebiet or federal territory is defined by Article 1 of the constitution which can be altered only by legislation The colonies do not form part of the Bundesgebiet and it was consequently found that the Franco 14

to declare war and make peace and to conclude other treaties with foreign governments The latter require for their validity the assent of the chambers in so far as they are commercial treaties or imnose burdens on the state or obligations on its individual subjects658 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW German conventions of November 4 1911 which both ceded and added territory did not require acceptance by the Reichstag Dissatisfaction resulted and the government assented to an amendment to the colonial law worded as follows An imperial law is required for the acquisition and cession of a protectorate or part of such This provision does not apply to the question of the adjustment of frontiers In practical effect this pro vision makes an addition to the list of treaty subjects requiring legislation listed in Article 4 of the constitution16 The treaties subject to approval by the Reichstag are more numerous than those in almost any other European state The provision in this respect is Article 4 of the constitution concern ing which Article 11 stipulates  So far as treaties with foreign countries refer to matters which according to Article 4 belong to the domain of imperial legisla tion the consent of the Federal Council shall be required for the ratification and the approval of the Reichstag shall be neces sary to their validity Article 4 of the constitution therefore furnishes evidence of legislative control over treaties similar to that already adduced in the case of France Its provisions however will be found to differ considerably from the French stipulation They read Article 4 The following matters shall be subject to the supervision of the empire and to the legislation thereof 1 Regulations respecting freedom of migration domicile and the settlement of natives of one state in the territory of another the rights of citizenship the issuing and examination of passports and surveillance of foreigners industrial affairs including insurance business so far as these matters are not already provided for by Article 3 of this constitution in Bavaria however exclusive of laws relating to domicile and the settle ments of natives of one state in the territory of another and 16The colonial law amendment is of particular interest at present because the Reichstag would have to assent to any cession of colonial territory as a result of war It is interesting to note that AlsaceLorraine and Heligoland are neither included in the constitutional Bundesgebiet nor within the definition of protectorateLEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 659

commer cial law and the law relating to bills of exchange likewise judicial proceedings660 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW  16 Provisions regarding the press and societies The emperor has been somewhat restricted since 1908 as a prime factor in matters of foreign policy On October 28 of that year a former diplomat published in the London Daily Telegraph an authorized conversation with the kaiser It was a very frank protestation of friendliness toward Great Britain backed up with what were evidently considered justificatory revelations and an elaborate assertion of Germanys foreign policy It emphasized the kaisers goodwill despite an adverse opinion among some of his subjects As a calculated indiscretion it created a furore and at home a peremptory demand that the emperor should recognize that it was his business to be seen rather than heard Subsequent occurrences were interesting and significant The North German Gazette19 published an official statement that the emperor had permitted the publication of the interview without the knowledge of those responsible for the policy of the empire The manuscript was sent to the chancellor who re ferred it to the foreign office with instructions to submit it to the most careful examination As no objections were raised in the report of the foreign office the article was published When the chancellor became acquainted with the article he informed the emperor that he had not himself read the draft He con sidered himself responsible for its publication and tendered his resignation which was refused To Reuters news agency it was stated that the foreign office had assumed that publication had already been decided on and that all that was required was to confirm the historical accuracy of the facts The Reichstag convened on November 4 Interpellations were introduced at the opening session by representatives of the National Liberal the German Freethinking Peoples the Social Democratic the Conservative and the Imperial parties20 19 London Times weekly edition November 20 1908 p 739 20 The texts of the interpellations are published in Verhandlungen des Reichs tags XII Legislaturperiode 1 Session Band 248 Anlagen zu

occupied the session The chancellor made a critical defense of the emperors published statement and an nounced that thereafter the kaiser would not speak without consultation He used this language The

pressure of the enemy At any rate the Reichstag is a vociferous factor in German politics And it seems to be making headway in affecting the mechanism of de termining policy for Chancellor Michaelis speaking in the main committee of the Reichstag late in August 1917 described the functions of a new Reichstag committee whose first duties seem to have been discussion with the government of the German reply to the Popes peace note of August 17 1917 The chancellor is quoted as saying In order to bring about closer cooperation between the lead ers of the empire and the parties he had also other measures in contemplation He had discussed these questions with the leaders of the Reichstag parties and with members of the Bundes rath who were entitled to vote and he could confidently rely upon the approval of the allied governments What was in tended was the convening of a free committee to deal with defined single questions such as the reply to the papal peace note In this committee seven members were to be delegated from the five large parties in the Reichstagthat is to say two each from the Center and Socialist parties and one each from the Conserva tive National Liberal and the Progressive Peoples parties The Bundesrath was also to send seven delegates to the committee and the imperial chancellor would preside over them The committee was intended to be completely free and would there fore not be subjected to any order of business as in the Reichs tag It was not to be considered as representative of the Bun desrath or the government or of the parties from which its members were sent as delegates but as a free general body of persons experts in their respective capacities who had been called together in order to carry out certain political objects and enjoying political confidence23 It will be noted that this committee is consultative extra parliamentary and divided equally between the Bundesrath 23 London Times weekly edition August 31 1917 page 710 See also article German and Prussian Constitutional Reform by George Saunders The Net Europe Vol III 205664 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW and Reichstag The Bundesrath is controlled by Prussia and the vote of the chancellor would give a majority to that state It is not surprising therefore that the deliberations of the com mittee apparently failed to affect the text of the German reply of September 22 1917 to the Pope But the formation of the committee of itself is a forecast of changes that are impending In Great Britain the conduct of foreign relations is vested in the crown a term which certainly is not synonymous with the king regnant who nevertheless is the individual exercising the authority inherent in the crown The crown acting as the dele gate or representative of the nation enjoys the sole right of making treaties of declaring peace and war and generally of conducting all foreign relations but in those respects acts through the recognized constitutional channels upon the advice of the cabinet or the secretary of state for foreign affairs Mem bers of the cabinet act in the name of the crown constitutionally considered rather than as the agent of the king as a person This distinction brings into operation the rather elaborate system of checks and balances of the British constitution24 Thus though the king is theoretically capable of concluding treaties himself no treaty is valid without the imprint of the great seal which is in the custody of the lord chancellor When William III was determined to conclude the first partition treaty personally and in secret he could not proceed until Lord Somers placed the great seal to blank powers All treaties since 1700 with that exception have been negotiated by plenipotentiaries of the foreign office and so have been as responsibly concluded as any acts of the executive cabinet Maitland25 citing the decision in Walker v Baird 1892 L R A C 491 is of the opinion that a treaty made by the king has in general no legal effect whatever In dealing with a monarchical country however it is well to bear in mind that the personality of the monarch and the social prerogativesas distinguished from the

disposal may play a part in the conduct of gov ernmental affairs Either if deftly employed will give royalty a great influence and may even serve to accomplish purposes not in strict accord with the text of formal laws Something of this kind may come about from the personal influence of a mon arch on the members of a cabinet who will ordinarily be sus ceptible to the ideas or the rewards of the sovereign Not all monarchs are disposed to wield such influence which in these days is likely to aim at realizing popular aspiratons or at least what royalty conceives to be the countrys good26 The cabinet since the reign of William III has been a respon sible executive body depending for its tenure upon maintaining a majority in parliament Its control over treaties is therefore responsible in form and its practice regarding the negotiation of such instruments has been more and more careful As an illustration of the practice I quote the words of a lord high chancellor of a period before parliament was firmly fixed as the sovereign power in the state Speaking of the conclusion of the treaty of Breda the Earl of Clarendon said in his trial for treason Every dispatch from the ambassadors was read and debated at the council board and when such difficulties did arise that the ambassadors would not take upon them to make any conclusion     one of themselves     gave his majesty a full account before the council board of all that had passed in the treaty    Every particular article was at large debated at the board which took up many days  To conclude after a long debate for so many days upon every particular the king resolved with the concurrence of the whole board one or two persons only excepted to consent to the peace27 Turning to parliamentary action upon treaties there is in the United Kingdom a practical system that is analogous to that which constitutionally has developed in France Says an au thoritative work28 26 Compare Lowells summary in The Government of England I 4052 27 T B Howell A Complete Collection of State Trials VI 502503 28 Earl of Halsbury The Laws of England VI sec 679666 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW  Treaties thus concluded are in general binding upon the subject without express parliamentary sanction but the previous consent of or subsequent ratification by the legislature is legally necessary to their validity in certain cases Thus though treaties relating to war and peace the cession of territory or concluding alliances with foreign powers are generally conceded to be binding upon the nation without express parliamentary sanction it is deemed safer to obtain such sanc tion in the case of an important cession of territory And where taxation is imposed or a grant from the public funds rendered necessary or where the existing laws of trade and navigation are affected or where the private rights of the subject are inter fered with by a treaty concluded in time of peace it is appre hended that the previous or subsequent consent of parliament is in all cases required to render the treaty binding upon the subject and enforceable by officers of the crown But where the treaty is made to put an end to war or possibly to prevent war on public grounds and for the public safety it is doubtful whether the sanction of parliament would be always required In all cases however the courts are competent to inquire into matters involving the construction of treaties and other acts of state and the plea of an act of state or that the matter in volves the construction of treaties affords no valid defense to an action against officers of the crown for interference with the private rights of a British subject Respecting the conduct of foreign relations in general and particularly in determining policy and reaching diplomatic decisions the crown is likely to intervene The foreign secre tary is primarily responsible to the crown and to parliament for formulating and conducting the foreign policy of the coun try29 However the law may be respecting parliament and policy the crown is substantially supreme regarding the conduct of foreign relations In the Earl of

the rest of his majestys council against the express declaration of his majesty and his parliament30 Queen Victoria and in his lifetime her prince consort took a keen interest in external relations frequently for the best Edward VII himself par ticipated in diplomatic affairs In 1850 the queens desires respecting diplomatic decisions were definitely stated in the following note to her prime minister Lord John Russell The Queen requires first that Lord Palmerston will dis tinctly state what he proposes in a given case in order that the queen may know as distinctly to what she is giving her royal sanction Secondly having once given her sanction to a meas ure that it be not arbitrarily altered or modified by the minister Such an act she must consider as failing in sincerity toward the crown and justly to be visited by the exercise of her consti tutional right of dismissing that minister She expects to be kept informed of what passes between him and the foreign ministers before important decisions are taken based upon that intercourse to receive the foreign dispatches in good time and to have the drafts for her approval sent to her in sufficient time to make herself acquainted with their contents before they must be sent off31 The very next year the point came to trial After the coup detat of December 2 1851 by which Louis Napoleon seized the reigns of government at Paris the British cabinet decided that nothing should be done by her ambassador at Paris which could wear the appearance of an interference of any kind in the inter nal affairs of France Lord Palmerston the foreign secretary however expressed to M Walewski the French ambassador his entire approbation of the act of the president and that he could not have done otherwise than he had done Lord John Russell as prime minister asked for explanations The question at issue was whether the secretary of state was 30 Howell op cit XI 621624 31 liansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CXIX 90668 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW entitled on his own authority to write a dispatch as the organ of the queens government in which his colleagues of the cabinet had never concurred and to which the queen had never given her royal sanction It was decided in the negative by requiring Lord Palmerston to give up the seals of the foreign office after a lengthy review of the facts in parliament by Lord John Russell the premier on February 3 185232 The incident reveals the solidarity of the cabinet as the execu tive of the government in the name of the crown The usual practice was stated by Lord John Russell speaking in parliament on June 21 1871 According to the uniform practice of the foreign office the dispatches which I wrote were submitted to him Lord Palmerston as prime minister frequently he would write the whole dispatch over again and I was always ready to accept his draft33 That this is the current practice is shown by a remark of Sir Edward Grey in a speech at North Sunder land January 20 1912 A considerable amount of fault has been found with what some people think is and what they call my foreign policy but which of course ought not to be called my foreign policy be cause it is quite impossible for any individual foreign minister to carry out a policy which is not also in its main lines the policy of the cabinet of which he is a member24 Parliamentary intervention in foreign affairs occurs on the occasion of the foreign office vote and through interpellations which during Sir Edward Greys tenure of office were answered personally by him two days a week and at other times by an under secretary The foreign office vote has usually not resulted in a very keen or statesmanlike debate Sir Edward Grey speaking in parliament apparently assigned the reason when he said35 32 Hansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CXIX 92103 3 Hansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CCVI 1833 cf Vol CXIX 105 34 London Times weekly

The real reason for lack of control whether with regard to foreign policy or general policy or any great imperial matter is the congestion of business in the house of commons    As long as the house of commons remains without some great measure of devolution its business will be so con gested that with the best will in the world they would never be able to acquire that control of imperial policy which it can only acquire by frequent debates on important subjects It may be mentioned in proof that in the period 180110 foreign relations occupied 2675 per cent of the commons debates whereas in the period 188190 they occupied but 1175 per cent of the time36 Clearly any reform must be accomplished in parliament Recent criticism has harped on the same strings and has reverted to Henry Richards motion of March 19 1886 which was then lost by four votes and which read That in the opinion of this house it is not just or expedient to embark in war contract engagements involving grave re sponsibilities for the nation and add territories to the empire without the knowledge and consent of parliament37 Of this motion it may be said that it progresses in a circle No cabinet can embark in war without a vote of funds from parliament and it is therefore certain that no cabinet will fail ence between the secretary of state and her majestys representatives abroad it is of opinion that all facts of international importance ought to be made mat ter of official correspondence and as such to remain on record for the use not only of the government of the day but of their successors in office to be pro duced to or withheld from parliament by the ministers of the crown on their own responsibility That the absence of any such record more especially if such private cor respondence is referred to in public dispatches is injurious to the public service unjust alike to the foreign minister who made the communication and to official colleagues at home and calculated to withhold

tending toward war In the debate on the motion Mr Gladstone as prime minister asserted I am not sure that any instance could be quoted in which the queen has engaged in war in any technical sense without the consent of parliament8 The statement is probably extravagant in the unqualified terms which the prime minister chose to use but to one sort of war a kind obsolete in these days of national conflicts it certainly does apply because Section III of the Act of Settle ment adds a definite constitutional restriction That in case the crown and imperial dignity of this realm shall hereafter come to any person not being a native of this kingdom of England this nation be not obliged to engage in any war for the defence of any dominions or territories which do not belong to the crown of England without the consent of parliament39 As to contracting engagements without the knowledge and consent of parliament there is no lightheartedness concerning them as is commonly charged If as a minister of the crown he should forget his responsibilitiy the chief of the foreign office should turn back to the articles of impeachment in 1667 against Edward Earl of Clarendon which state 40 XVI That he hath deluded his majesty and the nation in all foreign treaties and negotiations relating to the late war Lord Derby then Lord Stanley and foreign minister speaking in 1867 in reply to a complaint that parliament could only discuss a treaty while the country was pledged by its obligations said All I can say is that is the constitution under which we live the power of making treaties is vested in the executive upon their responsibility If I may judge from my own feelings so far from trying to strain that responsibility a minister will always desire to be supported by the knowledge that the opinion of the house is in his favor41 38 Hansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CCCIII 1404 39 12  13 Will III c 2 1701 40 T B Howell A Complete Collection of State Trials VI 397 1 Hansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CLXXXVII 1916LEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 671 The addition of territories to the empire42 without the knowl edge or consent of parliament raises an exceedingly complicated question as to the relations of the crown and the numerous types of nonsovereign portions of the empire As a general rule says Sir Henry Jenkyns43 the British dominions cannot be added to or diminished without the consent of the crown As in most other constitutional questions the modern tendency is to consider that the crown could not do so important an act as surrendering British territory without the consent of parlia ment44 Where an imperial parliamentary act has expressly defined the boundaries of a colony or has bestowed a constitu tion on a colony within certain boundaries territory cannot be annexed to that colony so as to be completely fused with it  without statutory authority because a any such annexation would be altering an act of parliament and b colonial legislation cannot operate beyond the colony and there fore cannot extend to the new territory until it is by some means made part of the colony But the king unless restrained by an imperial act can give to any such colony     the ad ministration and government of any territory  The same law appears to apply where the boundaries     of a colony are altered by diminution    Irregular annexa tions have been validated by parliament45 In 1895 a general act 58  59 Vict c 34 was passed enabling the crown by order in council or letters patent to alter the boundaries of any colony but this power was limited in the case of the selfgoverning colonies by requiring the consent of the colony It is therefore true that the foreign office in negotiating altera tions of territory acts usually on the initiative and as the agent of the nonsovereign entity concerned This is a power said Mr 42 The question of foreign office alteration of the territory of the British Isles proper has never arisen 43 British Rule and Jurisdiction Beyond the Seas 24 44 Sir Henry who as Parliamentary counsel from 1869 to 1899 was the official lraftsmain of legislation here cites the debates on the cession of Heligoland and the AngloGerman Agreement Act 1890 53  54 Vict c 20 as a precedent 45 See Jenkyns note for citations of acts respecting New South WVales Vic toria and Canada672 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Gladstone which in the abstract is greater than it is in prac tice    The difficulty arises in consequence of the politi cal considerations which have grown not out of the mere act of annexation     but on account of the liberty which has been assumed by the executive government in political and warlike proceedings antecedent to the annexation46 It can be seen from what has been said that Great Britain while possessing ostensibly an executive form of the conduct of foreign relations in reality has a form of such conduct that is responsible indirectly but actually to the legislative body The difficulty encountered in examining the British method of gov ernment lies in the fact that it has grown from practical condi tions and has never been made as a whole to conform to politi cal scientific theory of any kind The process is seen for our purpose in the development of the cabinet now in practice depending as respects tenure upon a parliamentary majority from the privy council which was and in theory still is a body of executive councillors chosen at will by the crown In Great Britain as elsewhere it is quite as likely that trained foreignoffice workers will act according to the real sentiment and interests of the country as would legislators untrained as a class in foreign relations Mr Gladstone as prime minister at the time of the Richard motion cited an instance The case of the lorch Arrow in connection with the difficulty in China in 1857     was a case in which it would have been perfectly possible for the executive government if they had been so minded to communicate the proceedings to the House but they did not think it necessary to do so They might have disowned it but they did not The late Lord Derby had the strongest feeling upon the subject He raised the question in the house of lords and moved a vote of censure but the house of lords supported the government The question was raised here and I took a strong part with per sons of various political shades of opinion and we beat the gov ernment But what happened When we went to our con 46 Hansards Parliamentary Debates Third Series Vol CCCIII 1402LEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 673 stituents a good many of us lost our seats and the country determined to support the government47 At present no policy of farreaching consequence is likely to be adopted without the knowledge and implied consent of the house of commons Responding to President Tafts proposal of unlimited arbitration Sir Edward Grey in a speech before the house on March 13 1911 said When agreement of that kind so sweeping as it is is pro posed to us we shall be delighted to have such a proposal But I should feel it was something so momentous and farreaching in its possible consequence that it would require not only the signature of both governments but the deliberate and decided sanction of parliament and that I believe would be obtained The treaty project when prepared was laid before parliament but it was not in terms a proposal for unlimited arbitration It was a combination of technical devices for the pacific settlement of all disputes That parliament accepted the proposal in prin ciple need not be doubted in view of the numerous questions and speeches concerning it though no vote was taken The question of ratification never arose because owing to restric tions put upon the treaty text by the United States senate the President did not push his policy to completion The declaration of war in 1914 was another instance of a similar character Statements by both the secretary of state for foreign affairs and the prime minister were made to parliament before the act and these were notably accurate as a textual 4 Hansards

gov ernment would not push toward war and would find a way to maintain peace but these members all seemed to agree with one of their number Ramsay Macdonald who referred to a house which in a great majority is with him Sir Edward Grey And the essence of parliamentary government is that a majority takes decisions and gives mandates The next day August 4 the prime minister announced the circumstances and the fact of the ultimatum again without oppositionA8 It is interesting to recall that the prime minister had forecasted such an attitude On March 24 1913 in reply to questions by Sir William Byles and Joseph King in parliament Mr Asquith said There are no unpublished agreements which will restrict or hamper the freedom of the government or of parliament to de cide whether or not Great Britain should participate in a war The use that would be made of the naval and military forces if the government and parliament decided to take part in a war is for obvious reasons not a matter about which public state ments can be made beforehand49 Evidence to the same general purport as that here adduced might be cited ad libitum The fact is that Great Britain has 48 Parliamentary Debates

centers about the house of commons Whoever should today study legal texts only says James Bryce5 might conclude that the crown and the house of lords are just as important members of the composite sovereign as is the house of commons It is fair to conclude that by the ordinary processes of legislation the house of commons can at present make any changes in the conduct of foreign relations that it desires THE AMERICAN TYPE The American type of handling foreign relations may be illustrated by the practice of the United States which at least has been the inspiration of the type throughout the majority of the states of the world It is that type which fundamentally makes the legislative branch of the government part of the treatymaking power and recognizes a right on its part to be informed and even to direct action on foreign relations So far as I am aware this type first came into use in the United States where it was an outgrowth of conditions rather than of a definitely thoughtout plan When the Declaration of Independence of July 4 1776 cancelled the control of British officials in the colonies they were confronted by the problem of setting up a government to fight the war that was already upon them The immediate thing was to cooperate in war and the continental congress proceeded to act It began work under almost the same conditions that a modern diplomatic conference would sit if its members had a right to vote always with repre sentative authority It was both the executive and legislative power in the state The continental congress as the only body with power soon found it necessary to handle foreign affairs for the American Revolution like all wars was won quite as much by diplomacy as by the sword The first continental congress had met at Philadelphia on September 5 1774 adopting soon after a loyal address to the 60 Studies in History and Jurisprudence 553676 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW king of England asking him to recall oppressive measures This address was sent to certain friends of American liberty in England who were instructed to act for the United Colonies Three out of the seven addressed did so and thus the first diplo matic act of the democracy was one initiated by legislative repre sentatives The effort failed and events headed toward rebel lion On November 29 1775 a committee of secret corre spondence was appointed by the second continental congress for the sole purpose of corresponding with our friends in Great Brit ain Ireland and other parts of the world and that they lay their correspondence before Congress when directed5 Ben jamin Franklin was its chairman After the Declaration of Independence its secret character was less necessary and on April 17 1777 it was succeeded by the committee for foreign affairs created by the congress The Articles of Confederation continued the arrangement which proved unsatisfactory A plan for a department of foreign affairs was reported to the congress in January 1781 and on August 10 1781 such a de partment was organized without the right of taking independent action Robert R Livingston the first head of the department was not an executive officer but rather a clerk for congress He was not intrusted with the initiation of diplomatic matters did not send papers of importance before submitting them to congress submitted to it all correspondence from abroad and simply executed resolutions of the congress directing the foreign policy The congress even held frequent interviews with the minister of France and more or less committed the confederation The system was apparently a legislative but really an execu tive control of foreign relations52 It is therefore significant that it failed It was never perfect for the mission in France was invested with almost unlimited power by the congress53 In 61 Francis Wharton Revolutionary Diplomatic Correspondence of the United States II 61 62 Similar organization has frequently appeared when a nascent state has developed only its sovereign assembly 63 See additional instructions to Benjamin Franklin Silas Deane and Arthur Lee commissioners from the United States of America to the king of France Wharton op cit II 172LEGISLATURES AND FOREIGN RELATIONS 677 fact it might be said that the congress as a legislature made of its executive secretary for foreign affairs a mere clerk and placed few limits on the power of its diplomatic officers54 There was throughout the period a rivalry of ideas between those who held for observance of the rules of international law and those who desired to disregard them Yet no matter how much congress might arrogate to itself supreme power executive authority grew up as coordinate with legislative The first form in which this executive authority asserted itself was in that of our legation at Paris Nor did this growth of executive coordinateness exhibit itself exclusively in foreign relations It was so in finance over which after the incapacity of committees for financial work had been demonstrated by many disasters Morris was granted a control which each day became more and more closely assimi lated to that exercised by the executive department of the gov ernment at the present day It was so in military affairs in which Washington gradually assumed the position which the executive now exercises in such affairs Thus it was that even congress itself which had at first been the sole organ of govern ment accepted under force of circumstances the establish ment in response to Washingtons appeal of January 29 1781 of executives or ministers in the departments of finances war the marine and foreign affairs The Constitution of the United States did not make this distribution of power It would be more proper to say that this distribution of power made the Constitution of the United States56 The Constitution which inaugurated a federal system took form under the influence of this preceding practice and of the philosophical arguments for the separation of powers of Mont tesquieu and Blackstone Legislative intervention in the con clusion of treaties resulted from the detailed character of the government that is its federal character By Article 6 of the 51 On the whole subject of government of foreign affairs by committees of congress see Wharton op cit Introduction secs 15 103 104 180 209 66 Wharton op

prince or state or between themselves without the consent of the congress while by Article 9 paragraph 1 foreign relations were placed within the sole and exclusive right of congress subject to the assent of nine of the thirteen states The funda mental problem was to combine a number of sovereign states into a workable system and to accomplish this result in the face of a pronounced particularism in the states The tenth amendment declared in force December 15 1791 states the principle which presided over the birth of the Constitution The powers not delegated to the United States by the Consti tution nor prohibited to it by the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people No consideration seems to have been given to foreign relations other than treaties in

cluded correspondence with and instructions to diplomatic and consular agents abroad and negotiations with the agents of foreign nations in the United States or to such other matters respecting foreign affairs as the President of the United States shall assign to the said department60 The American type of the conduct of foreign relations there fore centers the business in the executive with the exception of all treaties The explanation is that treaties are by the Con stitution laws and that the state itself isa federation The President and twothirds of the senators present therefore exer cise a legislative power in passing a treaty to be the law of the land while the senate alone is selected to perform this function because they thus make treaties binding upon the several states whose representatives are their two senators each A suspicion that the executive might be capable of acquiring undue power lay behind the division of the treatymaking power61 It is somewhat remarkable that the suspicion did not extend to the elaboration of foreign policy but calling for papers the power of impeachment and the reservation to congress of the right to declare war seemed and were safeguards in that respect The American system owing to the success of the United States has been widely copied It is logical only in a federal 60 The law shows internal evidence of being largely based on a persistent proj ect in the constitutional convention to provide for a cabinet in the fundamental document The project as given in the journal of August 20 1787 reads To assist the President in conducting the Public affairs there shall be a Council of State composed of the following Officers 4 The Secretary of foreign affairs who shall be appointed by the President during pleasure It shall be his duty to correspond with all foreign ministers prepare plans of Treaties and consider such as may be transmitted from abroad and generally to attend to the Interests of the United States in their connec tions with foreign Powers Farrand op cit II 3356 r The attitude of the constitutional convention toward the executive is illus trated by the definition of Mfr Wilson Farrand op cit I 70

Mexico Venezuela Colombia Brazil and Argentina Elsewhere its adoption has been due either to imitation or to the developing idea of legisla tive as the sole democratic control In Latin America and necessarily in the case of unicameral legislatures approval of treaties is usually by the congress as a whole This American type of the conduct of foreign relations operates with no more perfection than the others but it has several dis tinctive features not present in the others For instance it abolishes secret treaties62 but it encourages hairsplitting on the technical definition of a treaty within the meaning of the constitution and results in executive engagements through exchanges of notes and other subterfuges States possessing it publish their annual diplomatic correspondence as a whole bar ring those parts affecting or reflecting on the interests of third states not parties to the negotiations In the legislative depart ment of the government there is usually a restricted committee the members of which are more fully informed than their col leagues and the legislative department as a whole comes to depend on their judgment voting their recommendations as a rule The function of the legislature tends to become perfunc tory and the attitude of the committee tends to coincide with that of the executive 62 True only if the executive and legislative departments do not themselves agree to preserve secrecyC  I   I M go M b 0 0 0 W 14 as W   C 0 0 0 z 0 0  0 0 QD 0 0 O 0 z 0 I 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0  Cd cd Cd cd cd cd 03 C3 0 ce cd ad cd 03 Go 0 0 OD 4Dcd 03 0 GO

Presents received was a Thermometer presented by Mr Augustus De Morgan which had beet made in Florence in the seventeenlth century It was one of a collection discovered in the Mllusco Fisico of VOL

inferred from observed Terrestrial Galvanic Currents anid Discussion of the Magnetic Effects in ferred fronm Galvanic Currents oni days of tranquil magnetism By GEORGE B1DDELL AiRy Astronomer Royal Received De cember 22 1869 Abstract The author after referring to his paper in the Philosophical Transac tions for 1868 on the comparison of Magnetic Disturbances inferred from Galvanic Currents recorded by the Selfregistering Galvanometers of the Royal Observatory of Greenwich with the Magnetic Disturbances regis tered by the Magnetometers on 17 days states that he had now under taken the examination of the whole of the Galvanic Currents recorded during the establishment of the Croydon and Dartford wires from 1865 April 1 to 1867 October 24 The days of observation were divided into three groupsNo I containing days of considerable magnetic dis turbance and therein including not only the 17 days above mentioned but also 36 additional days No 2 containing days of moderate dis turbance of which no further use was made and No 3 containing the days of tranquil magnetism The comparisons of the additional 36 disturbed days were made in the same mannier as those of the preceding 17 days and the inferences were the same The results were shown in the same manner by comparison of curves which were exhibited to the Society The points mnost worthy of notice are that the general agreement of the strong irregularities Gal vanic arid Magnetic is very close that the galvanic irregularities usually precede the magnetic in time and that the northerly magnetic force appears to be increased The author remarks that no records appeared open to doubt as regards instrumental error except those of western de clination and to remove this he had compared the Greenwich Curves with the Kew Curves and had found them absolutely identical The author then proceeds with the discussion of the Galvanic Current Curves on days of tranquil magnetism not by wray of comparison with the magnetic curves but for independent examination of the galvanic laws The method was explained of measuring the ordinates and colinecting the measures into expressions for magnetic action at every hour and group1870 Coimbra Monthly Magnetic Determinations 185 ing the measures at the same nominal hour by months and taking their monthly means for each hour As these exhibited sensible discordance they were smoothed by taking the means of adjacent numbers taking the means of the adjacent numbers of the new series and so on repeating the operation six times The author explains the theory of this process and the way in which it tends to degrade the periodical terms of higher orders He then explains an easy method of resolving the numbers so smoothed into periodical terms recurring once in the day twice in the day thrice in the day c and applies the method to the numbers for every month When these quantities which from month to month are perfectly inde pendent are brought together in tables they present such an agreement with gradual change accompanving the change of seasons as leaves nlo doubt on their representationi of a real law of the diurnal changes of the galvanic currents They also show the existence of a constant turn towards the north which explains the apparent increase of force to the north observed in the results for days of great disturbance and a still larger force towards the west which also is well marked on the days of great disturbance No liglht is obtained on the origin of these terms but they appear to be probably pure galvanic accidents depending on the nature of the earthconnexions The author then exhibits in curves the diurnal iniequalities of mag netism which the galvanic currents must produce The form generally consists of two parallel lobes making with the magnetic meridian an angle of nearly 600 from the north towards the west The greatest eastand west differeince of ordinates in the month of April is 000044 of Total Horizontal Magnetic Force it corresponds in the hours to which those ordinates relate nearly with the Ordinary Diurnal Inequality But it is much smaller than the ordinary diurnal inequality aild the daily law of the galvanomagnetic inequality differs greatly from that of diurnal in equality For the greater part therefore of diurnal inequiality the cause is yet to be found

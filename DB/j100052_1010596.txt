AND PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS THE RECORD OF A YEARS ADVANCE A SYMPOSIUM CHICAGO BY HUGO S GROSSER ESQ CITY STATISTICIAN CHICAGO ILL ALTHOUGH THE PARK SYSTEM OF CHICAGO IS ALMOST AS OLD AS THE CITY ITSELF ITS GROWTH HAS IN NO WAY KEPT PACE WITH THE GROWTH OF THE CITY AND TODAY THE GREAT CITY OF CHICAGO WITH ITS AREA OF I90 SQUARE MILES HAS A TOTAL PARK AREA OF ONLY 2463 ACRES A SMALLER AREA PER CAPITA OF THE POPULATION THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE LARGER CITIES IN THIS COUNTRY CHICAGOS FIRST PARK WAS ESTABLISHED IN I839 TWO YEARS AFTER THE INCOR PORATION OF THE CITY AND CONSISTED OF ONEHALF A SQUARE ON THE LAKE FRONT EXTENDING TO MICHIGAN AVENUE DURING THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS ADDITIONS WERE MADE TO THE PARK SYSTEM BY THE GIFT OF SMALL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND THERE WERE ULTIMATELY SOME FORTYFOUR PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PARKS IN EXISTENCE WHEN THE FIRST SYSTEMATIC PLAN WAS INAUGURATED FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF CHICAGOS PARK SYSTEM CHICAGOS PARKS ARE NOT UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE CITY GOVERNMENT BUT ARE GOVERNED BY THREE DIFFERENT PARK BOARDS CREATED THROUGH ACTS OF THE STATE LEGISLATURE FROM I869 TO I87I THE LINCOLN PARK COMMISSIONERS ARE IN CHARGE OF LINCOLN PARKWHICH HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE ABOLITION OF A CEMETERY AS EARLY AS I860 WHILE THE REST OF THAT PARK WAS MADE FROM SAND WASTES AND SWAMPSAND THE BOULEVARD SYSTEM AND SMALLER PARKS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE CITY THE WEST CHICAGO PARK COM MISSIONERS RULE OVER THE PARKS ON THE WEST SIDE NAMELY DOUGLAS HUMBOLDT AND GARFIELD PARKS WHILE THE SOUTH PARK COMMISSIONERS ARE IN CHARGE OF THE PARK AREA ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE CITY THE LARGEST PARKS OF WHICH ARE WASHINGTON AND JACKSON PARKS THE FIRST TWO COMMISSIONS ARE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE WHILE THE SOUTH PARK COMMISSIONERS ARE ELECTE BY THE JUDGES OF COOK COUNTY THESE PARK BOARDS ARE ABSOLUTELY INDEPENDEN OF ANY OTHER GOVERNING BODY AND LEVY THEIR OWN TAXES FOR MANY YEARS IT HAS BEEN SOUGHT TO DO AWAY WITH THIS MULTIPLICITY OF TAXING BODIES AND IN A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE IN I904 PROVISION WAS MADE FOR A CONSOLIDATION BUT AS YET THE STATE LEGISLATURE HAS NOT PASSED ANY LAW TO CARRY INTO EFFECT THIS PROVISION BESIDES THE PARKS CONTROLLED BY THESE THREE PARK BOARDS THE CITY OF CHICAGO THROUGH ITS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS HAS JURISDICTION OVER SOME THIRTYSIX SMALL PARK SPACES AND TRIANGULAR PLOTS AT STREET INTERSECTIONS SOME 764PARKS AND PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS OF THESE HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE CONTROL OF THE PARK BOARDS THE EXPENSE FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THE SOCALLED CITY PARKS IS MET BY ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF THE CITY COUNCIL THE BOULEVARD SYSTEM IN CON NECTION WITH THE CHAIN OF PARKS WHICH IS BEING EXTENDED FROM YEAR TO YEAR IS ALSO IN CHARGE OF THE VARIOUS PARK BOARDS THE ORIGINAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION BEING DEFRAYED BY SPECIAL ASSESSMENT ON THE ABUTTING PROPERTY WHILE THE COST OF THEIR MAINTENANCE COMES OUT OF THE GENERAL PARK AND BOULEVARD TAXES A FEW YEARS AGO CHICAGO EXPERIENCED AN AWAKENING TO ITS PARK DEFICIENCIES DUE TO THE EFFORTS OF THE SPECIAL PARK COMMISSION TO OBTAIN SMALL PARKS AND PLAYGROUNDS IN THE CONGESTED DISTRICTS OF THE CITY THIS COMMISSION IS AP

THE MUCH NEEDED SMALL PARKS AFTER A VOTE IS TAKEN ON THE BOND ISSUE AT THE NOVEMBER ELECTION THE MOST INTERESTING SIDE OF THIS PARK EXTENSION ON THE SOUTH SIDE IS ITS SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL ASPECT

CONTEMPLATED CHANGES IN THE WATER SUPPLY SYSTEM HOW EVER INCLUDE PLANS FOR AN OUTDOOR SWIMMING POOL SIMILAR TO THAT NOW IN USE AT ERIE PA BUT IT IS PROBABLE THAT THIS WILL NOT BE CONSTRUCTED FOR SEVERAL YEARS WASHINGTON D C BY GEORGE S WILSON ESQ SECRETARY BOARD OF CHARITIES OF THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA THERE IS NO MATERIAL CHANGE IN THE PARK SYSTEM PROPER IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SINCE MY NOTES OF LAST YEAR CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE HOWEVER IN THE EFFORT TO DEVELOP PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS IN THE SMALL PARKS AND IN THE YARDS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BUILDINGS FOR THREE YEARS THE EFFORT TO CONDUCT PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS WAS CARRIED ON BY A VOLUNTEER COMMITTEE WITHOUT AID FROM THE PUBLIC TREASURY LAST YEAR OFFICIAL ENDORSE MENT WAS GIVEN TO THE MOVEMENT TO THE EXTENT OF AN APPROPRIATION OF 3500 I5OO FOR THE EQUIPMENT OF PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS IN SCHOOL YARDS AND 2OOO FOR PLAYGROUNDS NOT CONNECTED WITH PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE MAJOR PORTION OF THE BURDEN HOWEVER WAS STILL BORNE BY PRIVATE CONTRIBUTIONS THE PLAYGROUND MOVEMENT WAS FIRST STARTED IN WASHINGTON IN THE SUM MER OF I903 AND DURING THAT SUMMER SIX PLAYGROUNDS WERE MAINTAINED IN 1904 ELEVEN WERE IN OPERATION AND IN I905 NINETEEN WERE MAINTAINED OF THE NINETEEN MAINTAINED DURING THE PAST YEAR ELEVEN WERE IN PUBLIC SCHOOL YARDS AND EIGHT ON PUBLIC RESERVATIONS AND VACANT LOTS A TRAINED SUPERVISOR DR HENRY S CURTIS OF NEW YORK CITY WAS EMPLOYED FOR SIX MONTHS TO DIRECT THE WORK HIS TIME WAS OCCUPIED LARGELY IN SELECTING AND TRAINING KINDER GARTNERS AND ATHLETIC DIRECTORS WHOM THE COMMITTEE FOUND IT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROPER SUPERVISION OF THE WORK THE COMMITTEE SEEMS NOW TO BE CONVINCED THAT PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS CANNOT BE MADE SUCCESSFUL WITHOUT COMPETENT DIRECTORS THEY LOOK UPON A PLAYGROUND WITHOUT A DIRECTOR AS BEING ALMOST AS BAD AS A SCHOOL WITHOUT A TEACHER MUCH GREATER INTEREST WAS SHOWN IN THE MOVEMENT DURING THE PAST SUMMER THAN DURING THE PRECEDING YEARS ATHLETIC CONTESTS WERE HELD THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER AT THE VARIOUS GROUNDS AND BETWEEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DIFFERENT GROUNDS AND AT THE END OF THE SEASON ON SEPTEMBER 8 AND 9 FIELD DAYS WERE HELD THE SUCCESSFUL CONTESTANTS IN THESE FINAL EVENTS RECEIVED MEDALSGOLD MEDALS FOR FIRST PRIZES SILVER MEDALS FOR SECOND AND BRONZE MEDALS FOR THIRD A BANNER WAS GIVEN TO EACH WINNING TEAM AND A SPECIAL PRIZE BANNER THE GIFT OF ONE OF THE LOCAL NEWSPAPERS WAS PRESENTED TO THE TEAM WINNING THE LARGEST TOTAL NUMBER OF POINTS SEPARATE PLAY GROUNDS WERE CONDUCTED FOR WHITE AND FOR COLORED CHILDREN AND SEPARATE FIELD DAYS WERE HELD THE LOCAL COMMITTEE NOW FEELS THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PLAY GROUND NMOVEMENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DEMONSTRATED TO WARRANT GENEROUS APPRO 771 I59LTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PRIATION OF PUBLIC FUNDS FOR ITS MAINTENANCE AND AN EFFORT WILL BE MADE THIS WINTER TO SECURE FROM CONGRESS A LARGER APPROPRIATION FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF THE WORK AN EFFORT WILL ALSO BE MADE TO SECURE FUNDS TO PURCHASE AND EQUIP ONE SMALL PARK PLAYGROUND IT IS THE POLICY OF THE COMMITTEE TO URGE UPON THE CITY THE ACQUISITION OF SMALL PARKS TO BE USED AS PLAYGROUNDS IN THE VARIOUS CROWDED SECTIONS AND THEY ARE URGING AN APPROPRIATION THIS WINTER FOR THE FIRST OF SUCH PLAYGROUNDS WHICH THEY HOPE TO MAKE A MODEL AND USE AS AN ARGUMENT FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF OTHERS SEATTLE BY PROF J ALLEN SMITH UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SEATTLE THE FIRST STEP LOOKING TOWARD THE ACQUISITION OF LAND FOR PARK PURPOSES WAS TAKEN BY THE MUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES OF SEATTLE IN 1884 LITTLE WAS DONE HOWEVER DURING THE FOLLOWING DECADE AND NOT UNTIL ABOUT I897 DID THE NEED FOR PUBLIC PARKS BEGIN TO RECEIVE SERIOUS CONSIDERATION SINCE THIS DATE THE CITY HAS PURCHASED THREE TRACTS OF LANDWOODLAND PARK CONTAINING I96 ACRES WASHINGTON PARK WITH AN AREA OF 128 ACRES AND CITY PARK OF 125 ACRES WOODLAND PARK SITUATED IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CITY IS A BEAUTIFUL PIECE OF PROPERTY HAVING A FRONTAGE OF OVER HALF A MILE ON GREEN LAKE WASHINGTON PARK WHICH IS SITUATED IN THE EAST CENTRAL PART OF THE CITY EXTENDS FOR MORE THAN A MILE ALONG THE SHORE OF LAKE WASHINGTON CITY PARK IS JUST OUTSIDE OF THE CITY LIMITS AND IS AT PRESENT UNIMIPROVED THE NUNICIPAL AUTHORITIES HAVE ALSO ACQUIRED THROUGH GIFT OR PURCHASE SEVERAL SMALLER PIECES OF PROPERTY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE CITY A PLAN FOR THE IMPROVEMENT AND EXTENSION OF THE PRESENT PARK SYSTEM PREPARED BY A WELLKNOWN LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT OF MASSACHUSETTS IS NOW BEING CARRIED OUT UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE MUNICIPAL BOARD OF PARK COMMISSIONERS THE PLAN ADOPTED CONTEMPLATES THE PRESERVATION OF SOME REMNANTS OF THE ORIGINAL FOREST WHICH FORTUNATELY HAVE NOT BEEN DESTROYED IT WILL ALSO UTILIZE THE UNUSUAL ADVANTAGES WHICH SEATTLE POSSESSES IN THE ABUNDANCE VARIETY AND MAGNIFICENCE OF ITS VIEWS OF LAKE SOUND AND SNOWCAPPED MOUNTAINS THE CAMPUS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON SHOULD ALSO BE MENTIONED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SEATTLE PARK SYSTEM IT CONTAINS 355 ACRES A LARGE PORTION OF WHICH IS IN THE ORIGINAL FOREST STATE IT LIES BETWEEN LAKE WASH INGTON AND LAKE UNION HAVING A WATER FRONTAGE OF MORE THAN A MILE ON THE FORMER AND ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE ON THE LATTER IT IS WITHIN THE CITY LIMITS AND THOUGH BELONGING TO THE STATE IS VIRTUALLY A PART OF THE MUNICIPAL PARK SYSTEM DURING THE LAST TWO OR THREE YEARS THERE HAS BEEN A MARKED GROWTH OF SENTIMENT IN FAVOR OF PROVIDING SUITABLE MEANS OF RECREATION FOR THE PUPILS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SEVERAL OF THE SCHOOLS NOW HAVE TEETERS SWINGS HORI ZONTAL BARS BASKET BALL AND TENNIS COURTS ETC THE SCHEME OF RECREATION AND AMUSEMENT ALSO INCLUDES A GARDEN ON OR NEAR THE SCHOOL GROUNDS WHICH IS CARED FOR BY THE CHILDREN 772 I6OPARKS AND PUBLIC PLAYGROUNDS DULUTH BY W G JOERNS ESQ DULUTH MINN IN THE EARLIER DAYS DULUTH WAS PROVIDED WITH ONLY SUCH PUBLIC PARKS AS HAD BEEN RESERVED AND DEDICATED TO PUBLIC USE IN THE SEVERAL PLATS OF THE CITYS SUBDIVISIONS THESE WERE MOSTLY IN THE NATURE OF PUBLIC SQUARES EXCEPT A FEW LARGER DEDICATIONS IN SUBURBAN PLATS AND HAD REMAINED ALMOST WHOLLY UNIMPROVED IT WAS IN THE LATTER EIGHTIES THAT A BROADER SCOPE AND SYSTEMATIC DEVELOPMENT OF DULUTHS PARK SYSTEM WAS AGITATED AND INAUGU RATED THE PRIME FIGURE IN THIS MOVEMENT WAS MR W I ROGERS WHO WAS BETTER KNOWN TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AS THE ONETIME PRIVATE SECRETARY OF PRESI DENT HAYES MR ROGERS HAD COME TO DULUTH AND TOOK A DEEP INTEREST IN ITS DEVELOPMENT HE RECOGNIZED ITS WONDERFUL NATURAL BEAUTIES AND THE UNUSUAL POSSIBILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A SUBSTANTIAL AND BEAUTIFUL PARK SYSTEM HE WAS THE LEADER AND THE HARDEST WORKER IN THE MOVEMENT FOR THE CREATION OF THIS PARK SYSTEM AND TO HIS ENTHUSIASM AND GREAT EFFORT WAS LARGELY DUE THE FACT THAT THE SYSTEM AS IT EXISTS TODAY WAS FINALLY ESTABLISHED MR ROGERS BECAME THE FIRST PRESIDENT OF THE FIRST PARK BOARD OF DULUTH SIX HUNDRED FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF LAKE SUPERIOR ALONG THE BROW OF THE HILLS SURROUNDING DULUTH THE REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT BEACH FORM A NATURAL ROADWAY WHICH CONNECTS NUMEROUS SMALL WATER COURSES AND DEEP GORGES AND RAVINES AND ALL EXTENDING OVER A DISTANCE OF SOME SEVEN MILES OR MORE HAVE BEEN ACQUIRED BY THE CITY AND ARE NOW A PART OF THE PARK SYSTEM OF DULUTH AND FORM ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL NATURAL DRIVES IN THE WORLD THE CITY EXPENDED IN THE PURCHASE AND IMPROVEMENT OF THIS PARTICULAR PART OF ITS PARK SYSTEM APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THIS SUM FORMS A PART OF ITS PRESENT BONDED INDEBTEDNESS THE CONTROL OF THE PARKS AND PARKWAYS OF THE CITY IS VESTED IN A BOARD OF PARK COMMISSIONERS OF FIVE MEMBERS WHO ARE APPOINTED BY THE MAYOR SUBJECT TO CONFIRMATION BY THE DISTRICT COURT THE PRESIDENT OF THE PARK BOARD IS EXOFFICIO A MEMBER OF THE CITY CONFERENCE COMMITTEE THE MEM BERS SERVE WITHOUT PAY THE PARK FUND IS PROVIDED BY ANNUAL TAX LEVY AND HAS BEEN RUNNING AT ABOUT IOOOO A YEAR AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 5OOO WAS MADE FOR THE COMING YEAR TO PROVIDE MEANS FOR THE ACQUIREMENT OF ADDITIONAL PARK PROPERTY THE PUBLIC PARKS OF DULUTH ARE WELL DISTRIBUTED THROUGHOUT THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS OF THE CITY ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OF AND ARE EXTENSIVELY USED BY THE PUBLIC IN THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE SAME THE AIM HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO RETAIN AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THE NATURAL SCENIC BEAUTIES SOME OF THE SMALLER SQUARES HAVE BEEN MADE INTO BEAUTIFUL FLOWER GARDENS THE PARK BOARD HAS ALSO TAKEN CHARGE OF THE PLANTING OF TREES IN PUBLIC STREETS UNDER DIRECTION OF THE COMMON COUNCIL AND IN THE COURSE OF THE PAST TEN YEARS THE GENERAL BEAUTY OF THE CITY HAS BEEN THEREBY MUCH IMPROVED SOME OF THE PUBLIC SQUARES HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO RECREATION PURPOSES AS PLAYGROUNDS AND IN WINTER AS SKATING RINKS BUT DULUTH HAS AS YET NEITHER PUBLIC BATHS NOR GYMNASIA 773 I6I

D S R S T H E three first Volumes of this Work having been taken notice of in the Philosophical Trans actions N 155 from pag 100 to pag 109 I shall continue the Account of the rest in which the Heer Van Rheede lately the Worthy Governour of Malabar now chief Intendant of all the Dutch Colonies in India gives a most illustrious Specimen of his Industry and Generosity as also a noble Example to other Residents in Foreign Countries having at leisure Hours Collected Designd Painted Describd and learnt the Natural Pro ducts together with their Uses in Trade Diet and Me dicine and all in order to communicate his Discoveries to the World amidst his many great Employments in the Commonwealth both at Home and Abroad This Fourth Tome contains Sixty One Trees Shrubs and Arborescent Herbs together with their Sculps and Descriptions from the Life particularly of their Flow ers Fruits Seeds and their Vessels the Symbolical and Essential Marks of Plants neglected or else unob served by the Ancients whose Genius and Spirit pene trated very deep in most things except Natural History in683 in which they are very obscure confusd and unintel ligible even to the nicest Criticks and all for want of describing things with their proper Characteristic Notes which clearly distinguish them one from another In the last Age this was first started by the laborious and learn ed Gesner afterwards prosecuted by those two Italian Wits Andreas Caesalpinus and Fabius Columna but late ly most improvd by our own deservedly famous Coun tryman Mr John Ray in his excellent Histories of Plants and Animals The Exactness and Accuracy of the Moderns far above the Ancients in this part of Knowledge is so plain to any Man of common Observation or Reading that I cannot but wonder some should speak so contemptu ously of the last Ages as tho they only copied or com mented those that went before No useful Inventions No Improvements amongst us This may pass amongst some Smatterers in Philosophy or Ancient Bigots but never with Men of Science or free Thought nor in deed with any Body tolerably versd in the History of Nature or Arts So little need is there of Transcribing as some fancy the Old Books that if we join both all the Ancient and New together they will scarce make above an Essay towards the Discovery and Knowledge of almost Infinite and Inexhaustible Nature Veniet tem pus quo ista quae nunc latent in lucem dies extrahet  longioris aevi diligentia was the Opinion of the Ancients themselves But to the present Work before us of which some particulars are to be touchd upon Amongst the many rare Vegetables we have a com pleat History of that Pruniferous Tree called Mango by the English Mao or Mau by the Indians Ambo by the Brachmans which grows above 40 foot in height and 18 in thickness sweating out an odoriferous gum my Substance its Leaves and Root are of an Aroma R 2 tick684 tick Quality the Flowers grow in Clusters like those of the Vine are

Punctums then yellowish and afterwards of a Golden Colour with a thin downy Skin the Stone is oblong flattish and lanuginose the Kernel whereof resembles that of an Almond of these there are as many varieties in India as Peaches and Plums in Europe The Wood is in use amongst the Gentiles in burning their Dead Bodies to which tis consecrated and for making their Coffins or Urns The Brachmans adorn their Habitati ons with the Boughs on Festival days they rub their Teeth with the Leaves and use them as they do the Betel and Faufel the first of the Pepper the latter of the Palm kind the Gum is given in all sorts of Fluxes The Fruit is either eaten out of Wine or Pickle or in Conserve sometimes stuft with fresh Ginger Garlick Mustard c and sprinkled with Salt Oyl and Vinegar and so eaten

Shrubs the greatest part whereof are Si liquose as the TsettiMandarum calld by Breynius Fru tex Pavonius sive Crista Pavonis and by the Portu gueses Flos Pavonius from the Pride and Figure of its Flower Its Seed is not unlike that of Aldinus his Acacia in the Farnesian Garden yet it seems akin to the Senna kind Tsiapangam calld by the Dutch Rasphout not unlike the Red Wood of Brasil in all its parts and in the dying Trade for which tis sold up and down The Lobe or Pod is figurd by Clusius in his Exhot l 3 c 16 But here we have the full History of it Mouricou commonly calld the Coral Tree of

Acacias and Coluteas Many of the rest may be referd to Clusius his Exotick Lobes and Fruits which this Volume doth much illustrate the latter part whereof exhibits some Indian Jasmines and large Ca pers belonging rather to the Bacciferous Tome A Treatise of the Roman Ports and Forts in Kent By William Somner c To which is prefixt the Life of Mr Somner Printed at Oxford at the Theatre in 8 1693 THIS Book treating more of Antiquities than Na tural Philosophy will upon that account claim less room in these Tracts wherefore our Account there of shall be accordingly succinct The Life of the Author taking up the greater part of the Book is wrote by an ingenious Gentleman who therein commemorates several great Patrons of Learn ing689 ing next he shews the Pains our Author took to ac quire the Saxon Language then almost lost of the gra dual Decay of which Language he gives a short History Then he gives an Account of our Authors other Stu dies and Works whence it appears he intended a com pleat Treatise of the Antiquities of Kent this of the Roman Ports and Forts being a part thereof Speaking of the Difficulties of compiling Treatises of this Nature he gives a short View of several Antiquaries and their Designs and Labours most whereof are unpublishd and many lost He gives an Account of our Authors Trea tise of Gavelkind publishd in the year 1660 in 4to His Saxon Dictionary and concludes with a List of his Posthumous Manuscripts In the Treatise it self the Author begins with Rutu pium and rejecting other Opinions places it at Sand wich making Richborough Castle a Pharus to guide the Seamen into the Harbour and makes Gessoriacum more anciently Portus Iccius to be Bolen which Rutupium he says was then and sometime after called Lundenwich at which place he affirms Caesar first landed tho the Author of the Life allows of Mr Halleys Account thereof publishd in a late Transaction As to the Good wyn Sands he denies them ever to have been firm Land they are more soft fluid and porous and yet tenaci ous and consequently more voracious than other Sands which are harder solider and rockier Since they are not mentioned by any Writers of great Antiquity he believes they may be of late Emergency and possibly caused by the great Inundation in Flanders about Willi am the Seconds or Henry the Firsts Time the recess of which Water from these places probably left the Good win Sands shallower than formerly Next our Author speaks of Dubris now Dover To omit his Derivation of the Name he observes it was a Roman Port and has all along so continued Bolen on the French Coast and Rutupium on the British being in S time690 time supplanted the one first by Witsand and at last by Calis the other by Dover at which place our Author makes Caesar to have first attempted to land The For tification of the place in those days was more from Na ture than Art The Rock being cut into such Indenturesas resembled and were instead of Walls with Battlements which Time hath now worn away Proceeding to the Port of Lemanis which he makes new Romney so called from being the Romans Port and which altho for some Hundreds of years it has lain dry yet had formerly a fair and commodious River running by it and empty ing it self into the Sea much nearer the Town than now where he endeavours to shew that there was formerly a River of the name of Rother Romney and Limeneand that it had its mouth at or by Romney and whenand upon what occasion it forsook its wonted Channel The two first he proves by old Records where he observes that its Mouth was wide enough to receive a Fleet of 250 Sail of Danish Pirats An 893 which towed up their Vessels Four Miles within the Land which place it hath now so for saken that there is neither Harbour nor Channel which was turned another way by a great Inundation of the Sea about the year 1287 and so the Haven lost for want of the River to scour and keep it open Next he gives the Derivation of Romney Apledore Gilford and Winchelsey And so much for the Ports As to the Forts he begins with Regulbium now Recul ver where are still the Remains of Roman Tile here he observes by the way from Mr Burton that all places ending in Chester arise from the Ruines of the Old Ro man Castra this place being once called Raculfcester All the Roman Colonies c being upon Hills he be lieves this might be placed on the Ascent where the Church now stands or in the Church yard of which place and its Antiquities he enlarges 2 The next Fort is Rutupiumor Richborough of which before amongst the Ports The Remains of the Walls An Additional Note to Page 670 of

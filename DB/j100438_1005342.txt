ETHNOGRAPHY DERIVED FROM ANATOMY HISTORY AND THE MONU MENTS BY SAMUEL GEORGE MORTON M D READ DECEMBER 16 1842 JANUARY 6 AND APRIL 6 1843 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS EGYPT IS JUSTLY REGARDED AS THE PARENT OF CIVILIZATION THE CRADLE OF THE ARTS THE LAND OF MYSTERY HER MONUMENTS EXCITE OUR WONDER AND HER HISTORY CONFOUNDS CHRONOLOGY AND THE VERY PEOPLE WHO THRONGED HER CITIES WOULD BE UNKNOWNI TO US WERE IT NOT FOR THOSE VAST SEPULCHRES WHENCE THE DEAD HAVE ARISEN AS IT WERE TO BEAR WITNESS FOR THEM SELVES AND THEIR COUNTRY YET EVEN NOW THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ANCIENT EGYPTIANS ARE REGARDED WITH SINGULAR DIVERSITY OF OPINION BY THE LEARNED WHO VARIOUSLY REFER THEM TO THE JEWS ARABS HINDOOS NUBIANS AND NEGROES EVEN THE DETAILS OF ORGANIC STRUCTURE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE SAME UNCERTAINTYTHE CONFIGURATION OF THE HEAD THE POSITION OF THE EAR THE FORM OF THE TEETH THE COLOUR OF THE SKIN AND THE TEXTURE OF THE HAIR WHILE THE GREAT QUESTION IS ITSELF UNDETERMINEDWHETHER CIVILIZATION ASCENDED OR DESCENDED THE NILEWHETHER IT HAD ITS ORIGIN IN EGYPT OR IN ETHIOPIA THESE CONFLICTING OPINIONS LONG SINCE MADE ME DESIROUS TO INVESTIGATE THE SUBJECT FOR MYSELF BUT THE MANY DIFFICULTIES IN THE WAY OF OBTAINING ADEQUATE MATERIALS COMPELLED ME TO SUSPEND THE INQUIRY AND IT IS ONLY WITHIN A RECENT PERIOD THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE EFFECTIVELY TO RESUME IT IT GIVES ME GREAT PLEASURE TO STATE THAT MY PRESENT FACILITIES HAVE BEEN ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY DERIVED DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE SCIENTIFIC ZEAL AND PERSONAL FRIENDSHIP OF GEORGE R GLIDDON ESQ LATE UNITED STATES CONSUL FOR THE CITY OF CAIRO DURING A FORMER VISIT TO THE UNITED STATES THIS GENTLEMAN ENTERED WARMLY INTO MY VIEWS AND WISHES AND ON HIS RETURN TO THE EAST IN 1838 HE COMMENCED HIS RESEARCHES ON MY BEHALF AND IN THE COURSE OF HIS VARIOUS TRAVELS IN EGYPT AND IN NUBIA AS FAR AS THE SECOND CATARACT HE PROCURED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTYSEVEN HUMAN CRANIA OF WHICH ONE HUNDRED PERTAIN TO THE ANCIENT INHABITANTS OF EGYPT OF THESE LAST SEVENTEEN WERE MOST OBLIGINGLY SENT ME AT THE INSTANCE OF MR GLIDDON BY M CLOT BEY THE DISTINGUISHED SURGEON IN CHIEF TO THE VICEROY OF EGYPT THEY ARE ARRANGED BY THE LATTER GENTLEMAN INTO TWO SERIES THE PHARAONIC AND THE PTOLEMAIC BUT WITHOUT AVAILING MYSELF OF THIS CLASSIFICATION I HAVE MERELY REGARDED THEM IN REFERENCE TO THEIR NATIONAL CHARACTERS MR GLIDDONS RESIDENCE FOR THE GREATER PART OF TWENTYTHREE YEARS IN EGYPT AND HIS VOL IX2794 OBSERVATIONS ON EGYPTIAN ETHNOGRAPHY VARIED OFFICIAL AND OTHER AVOCATIONS TOGETHER WITH HIS ACQUAINTANCE WITH THE PEOPLE AND THEIR LANGUAGES HAVE GIVEN HIM UNUSUAL FACILITIES FOR COLLECTING THE REQUISITE MATERIALS WHILE THEIR AUTHENTICITY IS AMPLY VOUCHED FOR BY ONE WHO BLENDS THE CHARACTER OF A GEN TLEMAN WITH THE ATTAINMIENTS OF A SCHOLAR THE OBJECT OF THIS MEMOIR THEREFORE WILL BE TO THROW SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT ON THE QUESTIONS TO WHICH I HAVE ADVERTED AND TO ASCERTAIN IF POSSIBLE THE ETHNOGRAPHIC CHA RACTERS OF THE PRIMITIVE EGYPTIANS OR IN OTHER WORDS TO POINT OUT THEIR RELATIVE POSITION AMONG THE RACES OF MEN IT IS NECESSARY HOWEVER TO PREMISE THAT THE MATERIALS IN MY POSSESSION WERE COL LECTED WITHOUT THE SLIGHTEST BIAS OF OPINION ON THE PART OF MR GLIDDON WHO AT THE PERIOD IN QUESTION HAD PAID NO PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO ETHNOGRAPHY AND INDEED VERY MANY OF THESE CRANIA WERE RECEIVED BY ME IN THEIR ORIGINAL WRAPPINGS WHICH WERE FIRST REMOVED AFTER THE LAPSE OF AGES BY MY OWN HANDS IT IS FARTHER REQUISITE TO BEAR IN MIND THAT WITH A FEW EXCEPTIONS I HAVE NO CLEW WHATEVER WHEREBY TO ASCERTAIN OR EVEN TO CONJECTURE THE EPOCH TO WHICH THESE RENMAINS HAVE BELONGED THE EGYPTIAN CATACOMBS DO NOT ALWAYS CONTAIN THEIR ORIGINAL OCCUPANTS FOR THESE WERE OFTEN DISPLACED AND THE TOMBS RESOLD FOR MERCENARY PURPOSES WHENCE IT HAPPENS THAT MUMMIES OF THE GREEK AND ROMAN EPOCHS HAVE BEEN FOUND IN THOSE MORE ANCIENT RECEPTACLES WHICH HAD RECEIVED THE BODIES OF EGYPTIAN CITIZENS OF A FAR EARLIER DATE THE BODIES THUS DISPLACED HOWEVER WERE NOT DESTROYED AND THE EGYPTIANS OF AT LEAST TWENTYFIVE CENTURIES BEFORE OUR ERA THOUGH FOR THE MOST PART MINGLED WITHOUT REGARD TO RANK OR EPOCH ARE STILL PRESERVED IN THEIR INTERMINABLE CERNETERIES I DISCLAIM ALL KNOWLEDGE OF HIEROGLYPHIC LITERATURE BUT I MAY EXPRESS MY CONVICTION THAT THE PAST DISCOVERIES AND PENDING RESEARCHES OF YOUNG CHAMPOLLION ROSELLINI WILKINSON LEPSIUS AND SOME OTHER ILLUSTRIOUS MEN ARE DESTINED TO UNRAVEL ALL THAT HAS HITHERTO BEEN REGARDED AS MYSTICAL IN EGYPTIAN HISTORY WHILE THE INVALUABLE DISCLOSURES WHICH THEY HAVE ALREADY MADE ENTITLE THEM TO THE LASTING GRATITUDE OF THE STUDENT OF ARCHAEOLOGY A FEW WORDS IN REFERENCE TO CHRONOLOGY ROSELLINI PLACES THE ACCESSION OF THE XVI DYNASTY OF EGYPTIAN KINGS AT 2272 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST CHAMPOLLION ADOPTS A NEARLY SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT THE LEARNED DR WISEMAN ADMITS THIAT THERE ARE MONUMENTS IN EGYPT AS OLD AS 2200 YEARS BEFORE OUR ERA AND DR PRICHARD DATES THE ACCESSION OF MENES TWO CENTURIES EARLIER IN TIME THE VENERATION WITH WHICH ALL THESE AUTHORS REGARD THE SACRED WRITINGS HAS GIVEN ME THE GREATER CONFIDENCE IN THEIR OPINIONS WHICH I THEREFORE ADOPT IN GENERAL FOR THE DISTANT LANDMNARKS OF TIME AND IN RESPECT TO LATER AND SUBORDINATE DATES I HAVE BEEN GOVERNED EXCLUSIVELY BY THE PUBLISHED SYSTEM OF PROFES SOR ROSELLINI WHICH IS REGARDED BY COMPETENT JUDGES AS MORE COMPLETE THAN ANY OTHER I HAVE GREAT PLEASURE IN STATING THAT FOR THE UNRESTRICTED USE OF THE FIRST COPY OF ROSELLINIS SPLENDID WORK WHICH WAS BROUGHT TO THE UNITED STATES I AM INDEBTED TO AN ACCOMPLISHED TRAVELLER RICHARD K HAIGHT ESQ OF NEW YORK A GENTLEMAN WHO DE VOTES HIS LEISURE HOURS AND OPULENT INCOME TO THE PROMOTION OF ARCHBEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE TO JOHN GLIDDON ESQ UNITED STATES CONSUL AT ALEXANDRIA TO THE REV GEORGE W BRIDGES AND TO M E PRISSE NOW IN EGYPT I ALSO TAKE THIS OCCASION TO EXPRESS MY SIN CERE ACKNOWLEDGMENTS FOR THE PRACTICAL ZEAL WITH WHICH THEY HAVE AIDED MY RESEARCHESDERIVED FROM ANATOMY HISTORY AND THE MONUMENTS 95 I HAVE BEEN ENABLED TO MAKE EXTENSIVE ARID SATISFACTORY COMPARISONS BY MEANS OF NEARLY SIX HUNDRED HUMAN CRANIA WHICH FORM A PART OF MY PRIVATE ANATOMICAL COLLECTION THE NUMBERS IN BRACKETS REFER TO CORRESPONDING NUMBERS ON THE SKULLS THEMSELVES AND IN MY PRINTED CATALOGUE AND WILL SERVE AS A FUTURE TEST OF THE ACCURACY OF MY OBSERVATIONS WHICH EMBRACING AS THEY DO SUCH A MULTITUDE OF DETAILS MAY REQUIRE SOME REVISION AND CORRECTION HOW FAR THE FOLLOWING OBSERVATIONS MAY ASSIST IN SOLVING A PROBLEM WHICH UNTIL LATELY HAS BEEN CLOTHED IN EQUAL OBSCURITY AND INTEREST IS NOT FOR ME TO DETERMINE BUT I TRUST THEY WILL AT LEAST HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCITING OTHERS TO RESEARCHES OF A SIMILAR NATURE

IT WAS REMARKED FIFTY YEARS AGO BY THE LEARNED PROFESSOR BLUMENBACH THAT A PRINCIPAL REQUISITE FOR AN INQUIRY SUCH AS WE NOW PROPOSE WOULD BE A VERY CAREFUL TECHNICAL EXAMINATION OF THE SKULLS OF MUMMIES HITHERTO MET WITH TOGETHER WITH AN ACCURATE COMPARISON OF THESE SKULLS WITH THE MONUMENTS THIS IS PRECISELY THE DESIGN I HAVE IN VIEW IN THE FOLLOWING MEMOIR WHICH I THEREFORE COMMENCE BY AN ANALYSIS OF THE CHA RACTERS OF ALL THE CRANIA NOW IN MY POSSESSION THESE MAY BE REFERRED TO TWO OF THE GREAT RACES OF MEN THE CAUCASIAN AND THE NEGRO ALTHOUGH THERE IS A REMARKABLE DISPARITY IN THE NUMBER OF EACH THE CAUCASIAN HEADS ALSO VARY SO MUCH AMONG THEM SELVES AS TO PRESENT SEVERAL DIFFERENT TYPES OF THIS RACE WHICH MAY PERHAPS BE APPRO PRIATELY GROUPED UNDER THE FOLLOWING DESIGNATIONS  CAUCASLAN RACE 1 THE PELASGIC TYPE IN THIS DIVISION I PLACE THOSE HEADS WHICH PRESENT THE FINEST CONFORMATION AS SEEN IN THE CAUCASIAN NATIONS OF WESTERN ASIA AND MIDDLE AND SOUTHERN EUROPE THE PELASGIC LINEAMENTS ARE FAMILIAR TO US IN THE BEAUTIFUL MODELS OF GRECIALN ART WHICH ARE REMARKABLE FOR THE VOLUME OF THE HEAD IN COMPARISON WITH THAT OF THE FACE THE LARGE FACIAL ANGLE AND THE SYMMETRY AND DELICACY OF THE WHOLE OSTEOLOGICAL STRUCTURE PLATE III FIG 6 AND PLATE X FIG 8 ARE AMONG THE MANY EXAMPLES OF THIS CONFOR MATION 2 THE SEMITIC TYPE AS SEEN IN THE HEBREW COMMUNITIES IS MARKED BY A COMPARA TIVELY RECEDING FOREHEAD LONG ARCHED AND VERY PROMINENT NOSE A MARKED DISTANCE BETWEEN THE EYES A LOW HEAVY BROAD AND STRONG AND OFTEN HARSH DEVELOPMENT OF THE WHOLE FACIAL STRUCTURE PLATE XI FIG 2  I DO NOT USE THIS TERM WITH ETHNOGRAPHIC PRECISION BUT MERELY TO INDICATE THE MOST PERFECT TYPE OF CRANIOFACIAL OUTLINE96 OBSERVATIONS ON EGYPTIAN ETHNOGRAPHY 3 THE EGYPTIAN FORM DIFFERS FROM THE PELASGIC IN HAVING A NARROWER AND MORE RECEDING FOREHEAD WHILE THE FACE BEING MORE PROMINENT THE FACIAL ANALE IS CONSEQUENTLY LESS THE NOSE IS STRAIGHT OR AQUILINE THE FACE ANGULAR THE FEATURES OFTEN SHARP AND THE HAIR UNIFORMLY LONG SOFT AND CURLING IN THIS SERIES OF CRANIA I INCLUDE MANY OF WHICH THE CONFORMATION IS NOT APPRECIABLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE ARAB AND HINDOO BUT I HAVE NOT AS A RULE ATTEMPTED TO NOTE THESE DISTINCTIONS ALTHOUGH THEY ARE SO MARKED AS TO HAVE INDUCED ME IN THE EARLY STAGE OF THE INVESTIGATION AND FOR REASONS WHICH WILL APPEAR IN THE SEQUEL TO GROUP THEM TOGETHER WITH THE PROPER EGYPTIAN FORM UNDER THE PROVISIONAL NAME OF AUSTRALEGYPTIAN CRANIA I NOW HOWEVER PROPOSE TO RESTRICT THE LATTER TERM TO THOSE CAUCASIAN COMMUNITIES WHICH INHABITED THE NILOTIC VALLEY ABOVE EGYPT AMONG THE CAUCASIAN CRANIA ARE SOME WHICH APPEAR TO BLEND THE EGYPTIAN AND PELASGIC CHARACTERS THESE MIGHT BE CALLED EGYPTOPELASGIC HEADS BUT WITHOUT MAKING USE OF THIS TERM EXCEPT IN A VERY FEW INSTANCES BY WAY OF ILLUSTRATION I HAVE THOUGHT BEST TO TRANSFER THESE EXAMPLES FROM THE PELASGIC GROUP TO THE EGYPTIAN INAS MUCH AS THEY SO FAR CONFORM TO THE LATTER SERIES AS TO BE IDENTIFIED WITHOUT DIFFICULTY FOR EXAMPLES OF THIS MIXED FORM I REFER ESPECIALLY TO PLATE XI FIG 1 AND PLATE III FIG 7 NEGRO RACE THE TRUE NEGRO CONFORMATION REQUIRES NO COMMENT BUT IT IS NECESSARY TO OBSERVE THAT A PRACTISED EYE READILY DETECTS A FEW HEADS WITH DECIDEDLY MIXED CHARACTERS IN WHICH THOSE OF THE NEGRO PREDOMINATE FOR THESE I PROPOSE THE NAME OF NEGROID CRANIA FOR WHILE THE OSTEOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT IS MORE OR LESS THAT OF THE NEGRO THE HAIR IS LONG BUT SOMETIMES HARSH THUS INDICATING THAT COMBINATION OF FEATURES WHICH IS FAMILIAR IN THE MULATTO GRADES OF THE PRESENT DAY IT IS PROPER HOWEVER TO REMARK IN RELATION TO THE WHOLE SERIES OF CRANIA THAT WHILE THE GREATER PART IS READILY REFERRIBLE TO SOME ONE OF THE ABOVE SUBDIVISIONS THERE REMAIN OTHER EXAMPLES IN WHICH THE CAUCASIAN TRAITS PRE DOMINATE BUT ARE PARTIALLY BLENDED WITH THOSE OF THE NEGRO WHICH LAST INODIFY BOTH THE STRUCTURE AND EXPRESSION OF THE HEAD AND FACE WE PROCEED IN THE NEXT PLACE TO ANALYZE THESE CRANIA INDIVIDUALLY ARRANGING THEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONVENIENCE INITO SEVEN SERIES ACCORDING TO THEIR SEPULCHRAL LOCALITIES BEGINNING WITH THE NECROPOLIS OF MEMPHIS IN THE

SOUTHERN LIMIT OF SACCARA A DISTANCE OF ABOUT FIFTEEN MILES THE TOMBS ARE CUT IN THE SOLID ROCK AND FREQUENTLY COMMUNICATE WITH ONE ANOTHER FORMING A VAST SUBTERRANEAN LABYRINTH MEM PHIS IS WELL KNOWN TO BE ONE OF THE OLDEST IF NOT INDEED THE OLDEST OF THE EGYPTIAN CITIES AND AMONG THE TOMBS NOW EXTANT PROFESSOR ROSELLINI HAS FOUND SOME WHICH BEAR INSCRIP TIONS OF A DATE NEARLY 2300 YEARS BEFORE CHRIST AT WHICH PERIOD MEMPHIS MUST HAVE BEEN A LARGE AND FLOURISHING CITY THE SIMPLER CATACOMBS WERE PROBABLY CONSTRUCTED BEFORE THE PYRAMIDS FOR THESE LAST COULD ONLY RESULT FROM CENTURIES OF CIVILIZATION AND NEXT TO THE CATACOMBS ARE THE OLDEST EXISTING MONUMENTS OF THE HUMAN RACE AFROM THE PYRAMID OF FIVE STEPS IN THE MONITH OF AUGUST 1839 MR J S PERRING THE DISTINGUISHED ENGINEER DISCOVERED A FOZURTH ENTRANCE TO THIS PYRAMID WHICH WAS FOUND TO COMMUNICATE WITH A RECESS AT THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER OF A LARGE APARTMENT DESCRIBED IN HIS NARRATIVE THIS COMMUNICA TION IS A HORIZONTAL GALLERY ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTYSIX FEET LONG AND THE RECESS IS SEVENTY FEET ABOVE THE FLOOR  THE SOUTHERN END OF THE GALLERY OBSERVES COLONEL VYSE  WAS STOPPED UP WITH SAND BUT FOR THE LENGTH OF ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY FEET FROM THE INTERIOR IT WAS OPEN AND DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY VISITED AS NEARLY THIRTY MURNMIES WERE FOUND IN IT APPARENTLY UNDISTURBED THEY HAD NEITHER COFFINS NOR SARCOPHAGI NOR WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THREE OR FOUR ANY PAINTED DECORATIONS THEY CRUMBLED TO PIECES ON BEING TOUCHED AND COULD NOT BE REMOVED MR PERRING THEREFORE PROCEEDED TO EXA MINE THEM HE FOUND THEM ENCLOSED IN WRAPPERS WITH PITCH AND BITUMEN BUT HE DID NOT MEET WITH ANY OF THE OBJECTS USUALLY DEPOSITED WITH MUMMIES EXCEPTING SOME OF THE COMMON STONE IDOLS UPON THE BODY OF THE FEMALE HE THEREFORE CONCLUDED THAT THEY WERE THE BODIES OF PERSONS EMPLOYED IN THE BUILDING FORTUNATELY FOR MY INQUIRIES MR GLIDDON WAS AT HAND WHEN THESE RELICS WERE BROUGHT TO LIGHT AND OBTAINED THEM OF MR PERRING AS A CONTRIBUTION TO MY RESEARCHES WITH THE UTMOST CARE ON MR GLIDDONS PART TWO OF THREE REACHED ME IN SAFETY BUT THE THIRD WAS BROKEN INTO NUMBERLESS FRAGMENTS IN FACT THE CONSISTENCE OF THESE BONES IS BUT LITTLE FIRMER THAN UNBAKED CLAY AND THE ANIMAL MATTER IS NEARLY OBLITERATED IF MR PERRINGS OPINION BE CORRECT THAT THE PERSONS TO WHOM THESE BODIES BELONGED WERE COEVAL WITH THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PYRAMID WE MAY WITH SAFETY REGARD THEM AS THE MOST ANCIENT HUMAN REMAINS AT PRESENT KNOWN TO US WHETHER AS THAT GENTLEMAN SUGGESTS THEY PERTAINED TO WORKMEN EMPLOYED IN BUILDING THE PYRAMNID I WILL NOT PRE TEND TO DECIDE BUT ALTHOUGH THEY PRESENT INDIFFERENT INTELLECTUAL DEVELOPMENTS THEIR CONFORMATION IS THAT OF THE CAUCASIAN RACE PLATE I FIG 1 CAT 838 AN OVAL HEAD WITH A

DELICATEI C 89 CUBIC INCHES F A 790 PELASGIC FORM REMARKS ON THE PRECEDING SERIES OF CRANIAA MERE GLANCE AT THIS GROUP OF SKULLS WILL SATISFY ANY ONE ACCUSTOMED TO COMPARISONS OF THIS KIND THAT MOST OF THEM POSSESS THE CAU CASIAN TRAITS IN A MOST STRIKING AND UNEQUIVOCAL MANNER WHETHER WE REGARD THEIR FORM SIZE OR FACIAL ANGLE IT IS IN FACT QUESTIONABLE WHETHER A GREATER PROPORTION OF BEAUTIFULLY MOULDED HEADS WOULD BE FOUND AMONG AN EQUAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS TAKEN AT RANDOM FROM ANY EXISTING EUROPEAN NATION THE ENTIRE SERIES CONSISTS OF SIXTEEN EXAMPLES OF THE PELASGIC AND SEVEN OF THE EGYPTIAN FORM A SINGLE SEMITIC HEAD ONE OF THE NEGROID VARIETY AND ONE OF MIXED CONFORMATION OF THE ANTIQUITY OF THESE REMAINS THERE CAN BE NO QUESTION AND WITH RESPECT TO A PART OF THEM THOSE FROM THE PYRAMID OF FIVE STEPS WE HAVE EVIDENCE OF A MORE PRECISE CHARACTER THESE MOST ANCIENT MUMMIES APPEAR TO HAVE BEEN PREPARED WITH BUT LITTLE BITUMEN AND TO HAVE UNDERGONE DESICCATION BY SOME PRIMITIVE AND SIMPLE PROCESS OF EMBALMING SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS FIRST SATURATING THE BODY IN NATRON AND THEN SUBJECTING IT TO HEAT IN AN OVEN IT IS ALSO TO BE REMARKED THAT IN THESE TWO HEADS THE BRAIN HAS NOT BEEN RE MOVED THROUGH THE NOSTRILS ACCORDING TO THE GENERAL CUSTOM FOR THE ETHMOID BONE IS UNBROKEN AND THE CRANIAL CONTENTS COULD THEREFORE ONLY HAVE BEEN WITHDRAWN THROUGH THE FORAMEN MAGNUM AT THE BASE OF THE SKULL THIS LAST REMARK ALSO APPLIES TO SIXTEEN OTHER HEADS OF THIS SERIES WHENCE I WAS AT FIRST LED TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY COULD NOT PERTAIN TO A VERY REMOTE EPOCH BUT WHEN WE FIND THAT THE OLDEST RENMAINS ARE SIMILARLY CHARACTERIZED AND BEAR IN MIND THAT THE REMOVAL OF THE BRAIN THROUGH THE NOSE WAS A CONVENTIONAL PART OF THE MORE PERFECT ART OF EMBALM ING MAY WE NOT SUPPOSE THAT THIS IMPERFORATE STATE OF THE CRANIUM POINTS TO AN EARLY EPOCH OF EGYPTIAN HISTORY BEFORE MANKIND LHAD RESORTED TO THOSE ELABORATE METHODS OF PRESERVING THE DEAD BODY WHICH ARE SO REMARKABLE IN THE THEBAN CATACOMBS IT HAS BEEN CONJECTURED THAT THE PROXIMITY OF THE NATRON LAKES TO THE CITY OF MEMPHIS GAVE RISE TO THE CUSTOM OF EMBALMING AND IT IS NOT AN IMPROBABLE SUPPOSITION THAT THE PROFUSE EMPLOYMENT OF BITUMEN WAS A SUBSEQUENT REFINEMENT OF THE ART THIS SUGGESTION DERIVES SOME SUPPORT FROM ANOTHER FACT NAMELY THAT IN EVERY INSTANCE IN WHICH I HAVE OBSERVED THE BRAIN TO HAVE BEEN REMOVED THROUGH THE NOSE THE BONES AND INTEGUMENTS ARE MUCH MORE CHARGED WITH BITUMEN THAN IN THE IMPERFORATE CRANIA IT MAY PERHAPS BE CONJECTURED BY SOME THAT THE PELASGIC HEADS OF THIS SERIES BELONG TO THE PTOLEMAIC EPOCH AND HENCE PERTAIN TO THE GREEK INHABITANTS OF THAT AGE BUT IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT THE RULE OF THE PTOLEMIES LASTED BUT ABOUT THREE HUNDRED YEARS WHEREAS THE EGYPTIANS WERE

PONDEROUS SKULL IS OF UNFREQUENT OCCURRENCE I MAKE THIS REMARK WITH THE MORE SATIS FACTION BECAUSE IT ENABLES ME TO CONTEST ONE OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF HERODOTUS WHO TELLS US THAT ON VISITING THE FIELD OF BATTLE WHEREON THE EGYPTIANS HAD FOUGHT WITH THE PER SIANS HE SAW THE BONES OF THE LATTER LYING ON ONE SIDE AND THOSE OF THEIR ENEMIES ON THE OTHER HE THEN ADDS THAT  THE SKULLS OF THE FORMER WERE SO EXTREMELY SOFT AS TO YIELD TO THE SLIGHTEST IMPRESSION EVEN OF A PEBBLE THOSE OF THE EGYPTIANS ON THE CONTRARY WERE SO FIRM THAT THE BLOW OF A LARGE STONE WOULD HARDLY BREAK THEM THE HISTORIAN THEN EXPLAINS THE REASON OF THIS DIFFERENCE BY STATING THAT THE EGYPTIANS HAVE THICKER SKULLS BECAUSE THEIR HEADS ARE FREQUENTLY SHAVED AND MORE EXPOSED TO THE WEATHER WHILE THE PERSIANS HAVE SOFT SKULLS OWING TO THE HABITUAL USE OF CAPS WHICH PROTECT THEIR HEADS FROM THE SUN THESE REVERIES ARE WHOLLY UNTENABLE IN A PHYSIOLOGICAL POINT OF VIEW AND DERIVE NOT THE SMALLEST SUPPORT FROM ANATOMY ITSELF

PEASANTS WHO HABITUALLY SHAVE THE HEAD AND WEAR A THIN CAP AND YET THEIR SKULLS WHICH ARE OF VARIOUIS AGES FROM EARLY YOUTH TO SENILITY ARE WITHOUT EXCEPTION THIN AND DELICATE SOME MODERN AUTHORS HAVE

ALLOWED TO GROW IT IS REMARKABLE FOR A PROFUSION OF SHORT CURLS OF EXTREME FINENESSA CHARACTER WHICH IS PRESERVED IN SEVERAL OF THE ACCOMPANYING DELI NEATIONS HERODOTUS FARTHER TELLS US THAT THE EGYPTIANS KEPT THEIR HEADS SHAVED OR PERHAPS HE MIGHT HAVE SAID WITH MORE PRECISION CLOSELY CUT BUT WHILE THE PRIESTS CONFORMED TO THIS RULE WE ARE CERTAIN FROM THE FOREGOING FACTS THAT THERE WAS A DIVERSITY OF USAGE AMONG THE OTHER CLASSES WHICH IS ALSO PROVED BY ANOTHER PASSAGE IN THE SAME HISTORIAN FOR HE ASSURES US THAT  YOU SEE FEWER BALD IN EGYPT THAN IN ANY OTHER COUNTRY NOW IF THE EGYPTIANS OF ALL CLASSES KEPT THEIR HEADS SHAVED IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN AND YET MORE DIFFICULT TO SEE WHIETHER THEY WERE SUBJECT TO NATURAL BALDNESS OR NOT AGAIN IF HERODOTUS HAD NOT BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO OBSERVE THE EGYPTIANS WVEARING THEIR HAIR HOW COULD HE HAVE COMPARED THEM IN THIS RESPECT TO THE PEOPLE OF COLCHIS THE SAME AUTHOR INFORMS US THAT THE INHABITANTS OF EGYPT PERMITTED THEIR HAIR TO GROW AS A BADGE OF MOURNING AN OBSERVATION WHICH IS EVERY WHERE CORROBORATED IN MONUMEN TAL FUNEREAL SCENES IHIS OBSERVATION HOWEVER WAS PROBABLY FOR A COMPARATIVELY SHORT PERIOD AND

IN SUPPORT OF THIS VIEW WE FIND THAT THE MOTHER OF AMUNOPH III AND WIFE OF THOTMES IV WHO WAS A MEROITE PRINCESS IS PAINTED BLACK ON THE MONUMENTS THUS THE DIFFERENT COMPLEXION OF THE GREAT DIVI SIONS OF THE EGYPTIAN NATION MUST SOMETIMES HAVE BEEN BLENDED LIKE THEIR PHYSIOGNOMI CAL TRAITS EVEN IN THE MEMBERS OF THE ROYAL FAMILY IT IS NOT HOWEVER TO BE SUPPOSED THAT THE EGYPTIANS WERE REALLY RED

A PECULIAR INTEREST FOR THEY SHOW THAT AMONG SIX INDIVIDUALS OF THREE DIFFERENIT FAMILIES ONE ONLY HAD A DARK COMPLEXION AND THAT ALL THE REST WERE SALLOW FROM THE PRECEDING FACTS AND MANY OTHERS WHICH MIGHT BE ADDUCED I THINK WE MAY SAFELY CONCLUDE THAT THE COMPLEXION OF THE EGYPTIANS DID NOT DIFFER FROM THAT OF THE OTHER CAUCASIAN NATIONS IN THE SAME LATITUDES THAT WHILE THE HIGHER CLASSES WHO WERE SCREENED FROM THE ACTION OF A BURNING SUN WERE FAIR IN THE COMPARATIVE SENSE THE MIDDLE AND LOWER CLASSES LIKE THE MODERN BERBERS ARABS AND MOORS PRESENTED VARIOUS SHADES OF COMPLEXION EVEN

ADJACENT NATIONS AMONG WHICH THE SABLE NEGRO STOOD FORTH IN BOLD AND CONTRASTED CHARACTERS DR WISEMAAN AFTER A CRITICAL EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE IN REFERENCE TO THIS MOOTED QUESTION HAS ARRIVED AT THE FOLLOWING PHILOSOPHICAL CONCLUSION IT IS NOT EASY TO RECON CILE THE CONFLICTING RESULTS THUS OBTAINED FROM WRITERS AND FROM MONUMENTS AND IT IS NO WONDER THAT LEARNED MEN SHOULD HAVE DIFFERED WIDELY IN OPINION ON THE SUBJECT I SHOULD THINK THE BEST SOLUTION IS THAT EGYPT WAS THE COUNTRY WHERE THE GREEKS MIOST EASILY SAW THE INHABITANTS OF INTERIOR AFRICA THE NEGROES MANY OF WHOM DOUBTLESS FLOCKED THITHER AND WERE SETTLED THERE OR SERVED IN THE ARMY AS TRIBUTARIES OR PROVINCIALS AS THEY HAVE DONE IN LATER TINMES AND THUS THEY CAME TO BE CONFOUNDED BY WRITERS WITH THE COUNTRY WHERE ALONE

A TOMB AT THEBES WHICH DATES IN ROSELLINIS CHRONOLOGY SEVENTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTYSEVEN YEARS BEFORE OUR ERA IN THESE EFFIGIES ALL THE FEATURES ARE STRICTLY EGYPTIAN AND HOW STRIKINGLY DO THEY

THE PELASGIC AND SEMITIC FORMS WE MAY ADD THAT THIS CONFORMATION IS THE SAME WHICH PROF BLUMENBACH REFERS TO THE HINDOO VARIETY IN HIS TRIPLE CLASSIFICATION OF THE EGYPTIAN PEOPLE AND THIS LEADS US BRIEFLY TO INQUIRE WHO WERE THE EGYPTIANS IT IS IN THE SACRED WRITINGS ONLY THAT WE FIND ANY AUTHENTIC RECORDS OF THE PRIMEVAL MIGRATIONS OF OUR SPECIES IN THE GENERAL ALLOTMENT OF TERRITORIES TO THE OFFSPRING OF NOAH OBSERVES MR GLIDDON  EGYPT BY THE CONCURRENT TESTIMONY OF ALL BIBLICAL COM MENTATORS WAS ASSIGNED TO MIZRAIM THE SON OF HAM AS A DOMAIN AND FOR AN INHERITANCE WHENCE EGYPT HAS FROM THE REMOTEST TIMES BEEN CALLED BY THE NAMES OF MIZRAIM AND HAM OR KHEME MR GLIDDON ADDS THAT ALTHOUGH THE NAME OF MIZRAIM HAS NOT YET BEEN FOUND IN HIEROGLYPHIC LEGENDS THERE IS ABUNDANT SCRIPTURAL EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THE COUNTRY WAS CALLED MIZRAIM AND MITZAR BY THE JEWS WHILE AT THE PRESENT DAY THROUGHOUT THE EAST EGYPT AND CAIRO ARE UNIVERSALLY KNOWN BY THE COGNATE APPELLATION OF M1USSRT ENTERING AFRICA BY THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ4 THE CHILDREN OF HAM WERE USHERED INTO THE FERTILE VALLEY OF THE NILE A REGION PREPARED BY NATURE FOR SETTLED COMMUNITIES AND A PRIMEVAL CIVILIZATION IN A COUNTRY BOUNDED BY THE RED SEA ON THE ONE SIDE AND BY A WILDERNESS ON THE OTHER AND PRESENTING BUT A NARROW STRIP OF LAND FOR ITS INHABITANTS LAWS WOULD AT ONCE BECOME NECESSARY FOR MUTUAL PROTECTION

THE NORTH OF AFRICA BECAME THOSE NOMADIC TRIBES TO WHICH THE EARLIEST ANNALS GIVE THE IAME OF LIBYANS IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS VIEW OF THE QUESTION THAT WE SUPPOSE THE EGYPTIANS AND LIBYANS TO HAVE BEEN COGNATE PEOPLE THAT THE FORMER WERE THE ABORI GINALLL INHABITANTS OF THE VALLEY OF THE NILE AND THAT THEIR INSTITUTIONS HOWEVER NMODIFIED BY INTRUSIVE IIATIONS IN AFTER TIMES WERE THE OFFSPRING OF THEIR OWN MINDS IT WILL HOWEVER BE VERY NATURALLY OBJECTED THAT AMONG THE EGYPTIANS NO GRADATIONS ARE APPARENT BETWEEN BARBARISM AND REFINEMENT IT IS A REMARKABLE FACT7 SAYS SIR G WILKINSON THAT THE

OFFER NO OPINION WE MAY MERELY REMARK THAT THE BERBER THEORY IS FARTHER COUNTENANCED BY VARIOUS MYTHOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS AMONG THE MOST REMARKABLE OF WHICH IS THE SUPPOSED LIBYAN ORIGIN OF SEVERAL EGYPTIAN DIVINITIES PARTICULAR COMMUNITIES OF THE LIBYANS ARE FAMILIAR IN HISTORY BY THE NAMES OF MAURI TANIANS NUMIDIANS AND GETULI RESPECTING THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THESE PEOPLE HISTORY IS NEARLY SILENT YET THERE IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO PROVE THAT THEY POSSESSED THOSE FEATURES WHICH ARE NOW CALLED CAUCASIAN INDEPENDENTLY OF ANY NMODIFICATIONS THAT MAY HAVE RESULTED FROM THEIR LONG INTERCOURSE WITH PHENICIAN COLONIES AND THE ROMANS ARABS AND VANDALS IN LATER PERIODS OF TIME THE LIBYANS WERE A NOMADIC AND WARLIKE PEOPLE THEY WERE HABITUALLY EMPLOYED IN THE CARTHAGENIAN ARMIES AND

THESE SOURCEST THE PORTRAITS OF THESE INTRUSIVE KINGS AS RECENTLY DISCOVERED IN VARIOUS PARTS OF EGYPT NOT ONILY PRESENT A PHYSIOGNOMY ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE LEGITIMATE MONARCHS BUT THE

THIRTYFIVE CENTURIES IT WILL FOLLOW THAT UPWARDS OF TEN MILLIONS OF NEGROES HAVE BEENI BROUGHT AS BONDSMEN INTO EGYPT DURING THAT PE RIOD THIS I REGARD A REASONABLE CALCULATION FOR IN THE PRESENT WASTED AND DEPOPULATED CONDITION OF THE COUNTRY THE DEMAND FOR SERVANTS AND SLAVES MUST BE FAR BELOW WHAT IT WAS IN THE FLOURISHING EPOCH OF THE PHARAOHS THIS VAST INFLUX OF NEGROES INTO THE VALLEY OF THE NILE MUST NECESSARILY HAVE LEFT ITS IMPRESSION ON THE PHYSICAL TRAITS OF THE EGYPTIANS THIEMSELVES IN MODERN TIMIES AS SEEN IN THE COPTS AND IN MORE DISTANT PERIODS AS PROVED BY THE NEGROID HEADS

CONSTITUTED A MENIAL OR SLAVECASTE IN EGYPT IN REPLY IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT PERSONS OF THIS RACE HAVE BEEN CAPABLE IN ALL AGES OF ELEVATING THEMSELVES TO POSTS OF DISTINCTION IN THE EAST AND ESPECIALLY AND PROVERBIALLY THOSE WHO HAVE BELONGED TO THE CLASS OF EUNUCHST IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OBSERVE THAT SO TENACIOUS WERE THE EGYPTIANS OF THE RIGHTS OF THEIR OFFSPRING THAT THEY ADMITTED

THE SEMITIC FORM THIS OBSERVATION SUSTAINS THE OPINION OF PROFESSOR BLUMENBACH WHO IN COM PARING THE EGYPTIANS WITH THE SEVERAL RACES OF MEN ASSERTS THAT  THEY DIFFER FROM NONE MORE THAN FROM THE

NILOTIC POPULATION AS DERIVED FROM HISTORY AND THE MONUMENTS COINCIDE IN A REMARKABLE MANNER WITH THE FACTS DERIVED FROM ANATOMICAL COMPARISON IT BECOMES IN THE NEXT PLACE NECESSARY TO OFFER SOME EXPLANATION OF THESE RESULTS OR TO SHOW AT WHAT PERIODS AND UNDER WHAT CIRCUM STANCES SEVERAL DIFFERENT BRANCHES OF THE CAUCASIAN RACE WERE BLENDED INTO A SINGLE NATION POSSESSING MORE OR LESS THE CHARACTERISTICS OF EACH AND THIS AGAIN MODIFIED IN DEGREE BY ANOTHER RACE WHOLLY DIFFERENT FROM EITHER IT IS IN THE FIRST PLACE NECESSARY TO RECUR TO THE FACT OF THE VERY LONG OCCUPATION OF EGYPT BY SUCCESSIVE DYNASTIES OF HYKSHOS OR SHEPHERD KINGS AND THAT THESE WERE NOT OF ONE BUT OF SEVERAL NATIONSPHENICIANS PELASGI AND SCYTHIANS WHILE TO THESE FOLLOWED AT A LONG INTERVAL AN ETHIOPIAN OR AUSTRALEGYPTIAN DYNASTY EACH OF THESE GREAT REVOLUTIONS MUST HAVE TENDED IN TURN TO THE AMALGAMATION OF THE EGYPTIANS WITH OTHER NATIONS AND THIS RESULT MAY BE REFERRED TO THREE PRINCIPAL EPOCHS INDEPENDENTLY OF SEVERAL SUBORDINATE ONES THE FIRST EPOCH EMBRACES THE DYNASTY OF THE HYKSHOS OR SHEPHERD KINGS COMMENCING BEFORE CHRIST TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTY AND HAVING A DURATION OF TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY YEARS IT IS IMPORTANT HOWEVER TO OBSERVE THAT JOSEPHUS QUOTING MANETHO MAKES THE HYK SHOS DYNASTY LAST FIVE HUNDRED AND ELEVEN YEARS AND THE LEARNED BARON BUNSEN WHOSE WORK HAS NOT YET

WHICH IN THE LISTS OF MANETHO PRECEDE THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY WHICH LAST HEADED BY AMUNOPH THE FIRST DROVE OUT THE INTRU SIVE KINGS DURING THIS LONG PERIOD THE LEGITIMATE SOVEREIGNS WERE EXILED INTO ETHIOPIA AND IT IS EVIDENT THAT HAD MEROE BEEN ANY OTHER THAN A PROVINCE OR DEPENDENCY OF EGYPT IT IS HARDLY PROBABLE THAT THE EGYPTIANSKINGS PRIESTS AND PEOPLECOULD HAVE FOUND A SAFE ASYLUM IN THAT COUINTRY DURING THE LONG PERIOD OF THEIR EXILE IT IS EXPRESSLY STATED BY JOSEPHUS THAT THE SHEPHERD KINGS LIVED AT MEMPHIS AND MADE BOTH THE UPPER AND LOWER COUNTRY PAY TRIBUTE IT WOULD APPEAR HOWEVER THAT DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE HYKSHOS DYNASTY THE EGYPTIANS RETAINED POSSESSION OF THE THEBAID NEVERTHELESS THE OCCUPATION OF LOWER EGYPT BY THEIR ENEMIES MUST HAVE EFFECTUALLY PRE CLUDED ALL COMMUNICATION WITH OTHER COUNTRIES EXCEPTING ETHIOPIA SOUTHERN ARABIA AND INDIA WHICH FACT WILL ACCOUNT FOR A VAST INFLUX OF POPULATION FROM THOSE COUNTRIES AND CONSEQUENTLY FROM THE SLAVEREGIONS OF AFRICA INTO THE UPPER NILOTIC PROVINCES IT IS MOREOVER REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT EVEN AFTER THE EXPULSION OF THE HYKSHOS MUL TITUDES OF EGYPTIANS WOULD REMAIN IN ETHIOPIATHAT COUNTRY WHEREIN WHOLE GENERATIONS OF THEIR ANCESTORS HAD LIVED AND DIED AT THE SAME TIME THAT GREAT NUMBERS OF MEROITES INFLUENCED BY A VARIETY OF MOTIVES AND ESPECIALLY BY SOCIAL ALLIANCES WOULD DESCEND THE NILE INTO EGYPT IT IS MOREOVER EVIDENT THAT WHILE THE EGYPTIANS BECAME THUS FRATERNIZED WITH THE NA TIONS OF SOUTHERN ASIA AND THE MOTLEY RACES OF THE UPPER NILE THE PROVINCES OF LOWER EGYPT WOULD BE OVERRUN WITH THE CAUCASIAN TRIBES OF EUROPE AND WESTERN ASIA FOR THESE EITHER AS COGNATE WITH THE HYKSHOS OR AS ALLIES IN THEIR SERVICE MUST HAVE BEEN IN IMMENSE NUMBER TO HAVE CONQUERED SO POPULOUS A COUNTRY AND ESPECIALLY TO HAVE KEPT POSSESSION DURING SO LONG A PERIOD IT IS TO THESE EVENTS THEN THAT WE ATTRIBUTE THAT BLENDING OF NATIONS WHICH APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN COEVAL WITH THE EARLY AGES OF THE

LUBIMS AND SUKKIIMS ARE BY MOST COMMENTATORS REGARDED AS LIBYANS AND MEROITES WHILE AS THE ETHIOPIANS ARE PLACED LAST ON THE LIST AND ARE DESIG NATED IN THE HEBREW ORICINAL BY THE NAME OF CUSH IT IS NOT UNREASONABLE TO SUPPOSE THAT THEY WERE NEGROES THIS VIEW IS SUSTAINED BY A PASSAGE IN HERODOTUS WHO STATES THAT  IN MY CRANIA AMERICANA NOTE P 29 I HAVE EMPLOYED THIS PASSAGE TO SHOW THAT THOSE

NUMBER OF EMBALMED HEADS TO ENABLE HIM TO COMPARE THESE WITH THE MONUMENTAL EFFIGIES WITH THESE LIGHTS HE WOULD AT ONCE HAVE DETECTED AN ALLPERVADING PHYSIOGNOMY WHICH IS PECULIARLY AND ESSENTIALLY

MEMORY HOW INVALUABLE TO ETHNOGRAPHY ARE THE TWO STATUES OF THE FIRST OSORTASEN NOW IN THE ROYAL CABINET OF BERLIN THESE I HAVE NOT SEEN NOR THE MEMOIR IN WHICH DR LEPSIUS HAS DESCRIBED THEM I HAVE FOR THE MOST PART OMITTED ANY REMARKS ON THE INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL CHARACTER OF THE EGYPTIANS BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE EXTENDED MY WORK BEYOND THE LIMITS PRESCRIBED BY THE PRESENT MODE OF PUBLICATION I HAVE ALSO AVOIDED AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THOSE PHILOLOGICAL DISQUISITIONS WHICH HAVE OF LATE YEARS COMBINED SO MUCH INTEREST AND DISCREPANCY BUT WHICH ARE ALLIMPORTANT TO EGYPTIAN ETHNOGRAPHY AND ARE DAILY BECOMING BETTER UNDERSTOOD AND THEREFORE OF MORE PRACTICAL VALUE FOR AN INSTRUCTIVE VIEW OF THIS QUESTION AND MANY COLLATERAL FACTS AND OPINIONS THE READER IS REFERRED TO THE THIRD VOLUME OF DR

AND SENSITIVENESS OF LIQUIDS BY J H GLADSTONE PHD FRS AND THE REV T P DALE MA FRAS RECEIVED FEBRUARY 5READ MARCH 5 1863 IN A PREVIOUS PAPER  ON THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE REFRACTION OF LIGHT  WE STARTED SOME INQUIRIES WHICH HAVE BEEN SINCE PURSUED AND WE NLOW LAY BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY SOME OF THE LATER RESULTS THE SAME APPARATUS HAS BEEN EMPLOYED WITH A HOLLOW PRISM OF 610 0 ANGLE AND THE METHOD OF OBSERVATION HAS BEEN ESSENTIALLY THE SAME BUT EXPERIENCE HAS LED TO SOME MODIFICATIONS THE MOST IMPORTANT OF WHICH IS THIS INSTEAD OF ATTEMPTING TO TAKE THE ANGULAR MEASUREMENTS AT CERTAIN FOREDETERMINED TEMPERATURES AS 10 C 200C THEY WERE TAKEN FIRST AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM WHATEVER THAT MIGHT BE AND THEN AT SUCH OTHER TEMPERATURES AS SEEMED TO OFFER THE MOST TRUSTWORTHY RESULTS THIS INVOLVED MORE CALCULATION BUT IT STILL SAVED TIME AND SECURED GREATER ACCURACY THE PLAN OF MEASURING TO 10 WAS ABANDONED AS A USELESS NICETY BUT AS A RULE TWO OR MORE OBSERVATIONS OF EACH FIXED LINE AT EACH TEMPERATURE WERE TAKEN AND IF THEY DIFFERED SLIGHTLY THE MEAN WAS ADOPTED BUT IF THE DISCREPANCY AMOUNTED TO 2 OR 3 THE OBSERVATION WAS REPEATED THE AVERAGE OF THESE OBSERVATIONS OF THE LINES A D AND H AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES GAVE THE REFRACTIVE INDICES WHICH ARE PLACED TOGETHER IN THE TABLE THAT CONSTITUTES APPENDIX I AND THEY AFFORD THE DATA FOR NEARLY ALL THE COMPARISONS ABOUT TO BE INSTITUTED APPENDIX II CONTAINS THE MEAN DETERMINATIONS MADE OF THE REFRACTIVE INDICES OF SOME OF THESE LIQUIDS FOR A LARGER NUMBER OF THE LINES AT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ROOM TO IT HAVE BEEN ADDED SOME OBSERVATIONS ON OTHER LIQUIDS AND DETER MINATIONS PUBLISHED IN OUR FORMER PAPERS SO AS TO RENDER IT AS COMPLETE AS POSSIBLE FOR ANY WHO MAY DESIRE TO INVESTIGATE THE IRRATIONALITY OF THE SPECTRUM OR THE TRUTH OF THE FORMULAE OF CAUCHY AN ATTEMPT HAS BEEN MADE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE ERROR NOT SO MUCH ABSOLUTELY AS WITH REFERENCE TO THE DIFFERENT PURPOSES FOR WHICH THE OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE THE CONCLUSIONS ARRIVED AT ARE AS FOLLOWS WHERE THE REFRACTION OF DIFFERENT FIXED LINES AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE IS COMPARED THE PROBABLE ERROR IS VERY SMALL THE MEASUREMENTS MAY BE EASILY OBTAINED ACCURATE TO 1 CORRESPONDING TO ABOUT 00002 IN THE REFRACTIVE INDEX AND THUS THE RELATIVE REFRACTION OF A D AND H IN APPENDIX I OR OF ALL THE LINES IN APPENDIX II FOR ANY ONE SUBSTANCE WILL RARELY DIFFER FROM THE TRUTH BY MORE THAN THAT AMOUNT WHEN THE REFRACTION OF A SUBSTANCE AT ONE TEMPERATURE IS COMPARED WITH ITS REFRACTION  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1858 P 887 MDCCCLXIII 2 X318 DR J H GLADSTONE AND TEE REV T P DALE ON THE REFRACTION AT ANOTHER TEMPERATURE THERE EXISTS A SOURCE OF ERROR IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE PRECISE TEMPERATURE OF THAT PART OF THE LIQUID THROUGH WHICH THE SOLAR BEAM IS PASSING AT THE TIME WHEN THE MEASUREMENT IS TAKEN IT IS DIFFICULT TO AVOID THIS ERROR OR TO ESTIMATE ITS AMOUNT IT IS AS MAY BE SUPPOSED GENERALLY GREATEST AT THE TEMPERATURES FURTHEST REMOVED FROM THAT OF THE SURROUNDING OBJECTS AND IN THESE CASES THERE IS REASON TO FEAR THAT IT NOT UNFREQUENTLY AMOUNTS TO 1 OR 2 DEGREES CENTIGRADE EVEN AT THE ORDINARY TEMPERATURE AN ERROR MAY ARISE FROM THE HEATING POWER OF THE SUNBEAM THAT PASSES THROUGH THE LIQUID AND WHICH MAY NOT AFFECT THE THERMOMETER EQUALLY WITH THE SUBSTANCE WHOSE REFRACTION IS MEASURED IN SOME OF OUR MORE EXACT AND OUR LATER DETERMINATIONS A STRONG SOLUTION OF ALUM IN A FLATSIDED GLASS WAS INTERPOSED IN THE PATH OF THE RAY TO REDUCE ITS HEATING POWER WHERE THE REFRACTION OF ONE SUBSTANCE IS COMPARED WITH THAT OF ANOTHER ERROR MAY ALSO ARISE FROM INACCURACY IN OBTAINING THE MINIMUM DEVIATION THOUGH SEVERAL ADJUST MENTS HAVE TO BE MADE THE ERROR FROM THIS SOURCE IS PRACTICALLY CONFINED WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS AND RARELY IF EVER PASSES BEYOND THE FOURTH PLACE OF DECIMALS EVEN WITH VERY DISPERSIVE SUBSTANCES THIS ERROR WAS NOT SO WELL GUARDED AGAINST IN THE OBSERVA TIONS RECORDED IN OUR PREVIOUS PAPER AND IT MAY ALSO AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF THE SENSITIVENESS OF A FEW SUBSTANCES NAMELY THOSE WHERE A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT OF THE PRISM WAS MADE AT DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES BUT THESE ARE EASILY KNOWN AS THAT WAS ONLY DONE FOR LOW TEMPERATURES SUCH AS 8 C AND THEY ARE ALL MARKED IN APPENDIX I WITH AN ASTERISK IN ORDER TO BE RIGIDLY CORRECT THE HOLLOW PRISM OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED AFRESH FOR MINIMUM DEVIATION IN THE CASE OF EACH LINE AND AT EACH TEMPERATURE BUT THE MOVEMENT OF THE APPARATUS NECESSITATED BY THIS WOULD PRACTICALLY HAVE INTRODUCED GREATER ERRORS THAN RESULTED FROM THE NEGLECT OF IT YET THIS HAS AN APPRECIABLE EFFECT ON THE LENGTH OF THE SPECTRUM IN HIGHLY DISPERSIVE SUBSTANCES AND IN ORDER TO OBVIATE THE ERROR AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IN THE LATER MEASUREMENTS OF SUCH SUBSTANCES CARE WAS TAKEN TO FIX THE MINIMUM DEVIATION NOT FOR EITHER OF THE EXTREMITIES BUT FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE SPECTRUM IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO MAKE A CORRECTION BY THE USUAL FORMULA FOR A SMALL DEVIATION FROM THE MINIMUM ANGLE BUT WE DOUBTED WHETHER PRACTICALLY ANY THING WOULD BE GAINED CONSIDERING THE GREATER COMPLEXITY OF THE CALCULATION IF THE INDICES OF REFRACTION WERE TO BE CONSIDERED NOT RELATIVELY BUT ABSOLUTELY OTHER SOURCES OF ERROR WOULD HAVE TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR INSTANCE INACCURACY IN THE DETER MINATION OF THE PRISMANGLE FAULTS OF WORKMANSHIP IN THE APPARATUS FOR THESE IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO ASSIGN A LIMIT THEY MAY EVEN AFFECT THE THIRD PLACE OF DECIMALS WHEREAS THE COMBINED ERRORS FROM ALL THE OTHER SOURCES ARE PROBABLY CONFINED TO THE FOURTH PLACE BUT THE ABSOLUTE ACCURACY OF AN INDEX IS OF MINOR IMPORTANCE IN THE PRESENT RESEARCH THE PURITY OF THE LIQUIDS EXPERIMENTED ON IS OF COURSE A MATTER OF THE UTMOST CON SEQUENCE WHEN COMMERCIAL SPECIMENS WERE EMPLOYED THEY WERE ALWAYS PURIFIED OR THEIR PURITY ASCERTAINED MANY OF THE LIQUIDS WERE PREPARED IN DR GLADSTONES LABO RATORY WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO THIS INQUIRY AND MANY OTHERS WERE KINDLY PLACED AT OUR DISPOSAL BY THOSE CHEMISTS WHO HAD PAID SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THEM AND WE HAVEDISPERSION AND SENSITIVENESS OF LIQUIDS GENERALLY TAKEN

HAVE UNIFORMLY FOUND THAT THE REFRACTION DIMINISHES AS THE TEMPERATURE INCREASES THIS PROPERTY WE HAVE ALREADY NAMED  SENSITIVENESS WE HAVE UNIFORMLY FOUND ALSO THAT THE SPECTRUM DIMINISHES IN LENGTH AS THE TEMPE RATURE INCREASES IN A VERY FEW INSTANCES THIS DIMINUTION IS LOST WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ERRORS OF OBSERVATION BUT WE BELIEVE IT ALWAYS OCCURS THIS DIMINUTION IN LENGTH IS PROGRESSIVE THE

THERE IS SOME INTIMATE CONNEXION BETWEEN THE SENSITIVENESS OF A LIQUID AND ITS CHANGE OF VOLUME BY HEAT WAS POINTED OUT IN OUR FORMER PAPER AND OUR SUBSEQUENT EXPERIMENTS ONLY CONFIRMED THIS OPINION

ACETONE ACETIC ACID FORMIC ACETIC AND BUTYRIC ETHERS AND THE IODIDES OF METHYL AND ETHYL AFFORDED AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING THE MATTER SINCE THE ALTERATION OF THEIR VOLUME BY HEAT HAS BEEN VERY

REFRACTION IN THE CASE OF EVERY ONE OF THESE LIQUIDS THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF ANY RAY ALTERS LESS RAPIDLY THAN THE VOLUME BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT THE REFRACTIVE INDEX MINUS UNITY MULTI PLIED BY THE VOLUME GIVES NEARLY A CONSTANT IT IS OTHERWISE WITH THE CONTRACTION OF THE SPECTRUM ITSELF IN SOME CASES AS BISUL PHIDE OF CARBON IT CONTRACTS MUCH MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE VOLUME INCREASES AND IN OTHER CASES AS ETHER MUCH LESS RAPIDLY HERE IT MUST BE BORNE IN MIND THAT EVERY REFRACTIVE INDEX CONTAINS AT LEAST TWO COEFFICIENTS WHATEVER MAY BE THE PHYSICAL REASON AND TO WHATEVER EXTENT WE MAY ACCEPT

MULTIPLIED BY THE VOLUME OR EHA VOL WE CALL  SPECIFIC DISPERSION BUT AS ALREADY STATED THERE IS NO SIMPLE RELATION HOLDING GOOD FOR DIFFERENT LIQUIDS BETWEEN THE INCREASE OF VOLUME AND THE DECREASE OF DISPERSION BY HEAT THE PHENOMENA SEEM INDEPENDENT WE THEREFORE ARRIVE AT THE EMPIRICAL LAW THAT THE REFRACTIVE ENERGY OF A LIQUID VARIES DIRECTLY WITH ITS DENSITY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CHANGE OF TEMPERATURE OR IN OTHER WORDS THAT THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY OF A LIQUID IS A CONSTANT NOT AFFECTED BY TEMPERATURE BUT IN CONCLUDING THUS WE WISH IT TO BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THERE IS SOME INFLUENCE ARISING WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY FROM DISPERSION WHICH WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT BUT WHICH GIVES RISE TO THE SLIGHT PROGRESSION OF MOST OF THE CALCULATED PRODUCTS AND PERHAPS TO THE NONINVERSION OF THE SENSITIVENESS OF WATER AT 40 C REMARKED ON ALREADY BY JAMIN AND OURSELVES SECTION IITHE REFRACTION AND DISPERSION OF MIXTURES OF LIQUIDS THIS SUBJECT ENGAGED THE ATTENTION OF M DEVILLE AS FAR BACK AS 1842  AND OF LATE YEARS MESSRS HANDL AND A AND E WEISST HAVE PUBLISHED ELABORATE PAPERS ON IT BUT WITHOUT ARRIVING AT A SOLUTION OF THE QUESTION M HOEK HOWEVER PROCEEDING ON THE ASSUMPTION OF FRESNEL THAT THE DENSITY OF THE ETHER ENCLOSED IN A MEDIUM IS P21 IF THE DENSITY OF THE ETHER IN SPACE IS 1 FOUND THAT THE FORMULA DEDUCED FROM IT GAVE NUMBERS CLOSELY AGREEING WITH THOSE FOUND EXPERIMENTALLY BY DEVILLE FOR MIXTURES OF ALCOHOL AND WATER OR WOODSPIRIT AND WATER YET IT HAPPENS THAT THESE RESULTS CAN EQUALLY WELL BE EXPLAINED ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE POWER OF A MIX TURE IS THE MEAN OF THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE POWER OF ITS COMPONENTS AND THIS SUPPOSI TION SEEMED ALSO WARRANTED BY MOST OF THE RESULTS OF MESSRS WEISS AND BY SEVERAL THAT WE OURSELVES OBTAINED IT WAS CLEARLY DESIRABLE TO TEST THESE TWO OR ANY OTHER SUPPOSITIONS IN A CASE WHERE THE REFRACTIVE INDICES OF THE LIQUIDS MIXED WERE VERY WIDE APART FORTUNATELY BISUL PHIDE OF CARBON AND ETHER SUBSTANCES ALMOST AT THE OPPOSITE LIMITS OF THE SCALE WERE FOUND TO MIX AND THAT WITHOUT PERCEPTIBLE CONDENSATION NOT INDEED IN EQUAL VOLUMES BUT IN THE PROPORTION OF THREE VOLUMES OF ETHER TO ONE OF THE BISULPHIDE AT LOW TEMPE RATURES AND IN THE PROPORTION OF TWO TO ONE AT 200 C TWO EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE AT DIFFERENT SEASONS ON MIXTURES OF COMMERCIALLY PURE SPECIMENS OF THESE SUBSTANCES THE GREATEST CARE WAS TAKEN TO PREVENT EVAPORATION AS FAR AS POSSIBLE DURING THE PROGRESS OF THE EXPERIMENTS IT WILL BE SEEN THAT IN A CASE SUCH AS THIS WHERE THERE IS NO CONDENSATION ON

DISPERSION MORE RAPIDLY STILL WHILE THE SENSITIVENESS REMAINS NEARLY THE SAME IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT ON ACCOUNT OF THE SMALL NUMBERS BY WHICH THE SENSITIVENESS IS EXPRESSED AND THE SERIOUS SOURCE OF ERROR ARISING FROM THE DIFFICULTY OF DETERMINING THE TEMPERATURE WITH ACCURACY COMPARISONS OF THE SENSITIVENESS OF DIFFERENT LIQUIDS CANNOT BE SO SATISFACTORY AS COMPARISONS OF THEIR REFRACTIVE INDICES OR THE LENGTH OF THE SPECTRUM AS ALL THE DEGREES OF SENSITIVENESS AT 200 C KNOWN TO US LIE BETWEEN 00007 AND 0 0074 WE PROPOSE IN FUTURE OMITTING THE ZEROS AND SIMPLY STATING THAT THE SENSITIVENESS OF METHYLIC ALCOHOL FOR INSTANCE IS 36 WE SHALL OMIT THE ZEROS ALSO IN THE LAST THREE COLUMNS AS WE HAVE ALREADY LEARNT THE IMPORTANCE OF COMPARISONS OF SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY WE

BIBROMIDE OF BROMETHYLENE C4 H BR BR 15809 430 50 2220 164 19 HERE IN EACH CASE THE BROMINE HAS GREATLY INCREASED THE REFRACTION BUT THAT THIS IS OWING TO ITS GREAT WEIGHT IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY IS MUCH DIMINISHED THE DISPERSION IS INCREASED BUT THIS IS VERY NEARLY COUNTERBALANCED BY THE INCREASE OF WEIGHT THE SENSITIVENESS IS DIMINISHED AT LEAST IN THE ETHYLENE GROUP IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT IN EACH OF THE FIVE CASES MENTIONED IN THIS SECTION WHERE THERE ARE TWO SUBSTITUTION PRODUCTS THE LOWER ONE IS INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL SUBSTANCE AND THE HIGHER PRODUCT THESE OBSERVATIONS PUT US IN A POSITION TO CONSIDER THE QUESTION DOES AN ELEMENT RETAIN ITS SPECIAL INFLUENCE ON THE RAYS OF LIGHT WITH WHATEVER OTHER ELEMENTS IT MAY BE COMBINED AS THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY OF A MIXTURE OR A FEEBLE COMBINATION SUCH AS ALCOHOL AND WATER IS APPROXIMATELY THE MEAN OF THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGIES OF ITS CONSTITUENTS WE ARE PREPARED TO FIND THE RULE HOLDING GOOD IN MORE DISTINCT CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN THE ONLY CASE IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRY IT AMONG LIQUID ELEMENTS NAMELY TERBROMIDE OF PHOSPHORUS THE RESULT WAS PRETTY NEAR BUT THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT CHEMICAL COMBINATION OFTEN GREATLY CHANGES THE OPTICAL AS IT DOES THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF ELEMENTARY BODIES YET IT IS QUITE CONCEIVABLE THAT AN ELEMENT MAY RETAIN A SPECIFIC INFLUENCE ON THE RAYS OF LIGHT THROUGH MANY IF NOT ALL ITS COMPOUNDS AND THIS VIEW CERTAINLY FINDS SOME SUPPORT IN OUR EXPERIMENTS WITNESS THE FACT OF THE GREAT INCREASE BOTH OF REFRACTION AND DISPERSION CAUSED BY THE ADDITION OF NITROGEN WHETHER COMBINED WITH OXYGEN OR NOT TO COMPOUNDS OF CARBON AND HYDROGEN SEE APPENDIX I NOS 32 5255 5762 75 76 BUT WHEN WE LOOK MORE NARROWLY AT THE NUMBERS WE FIND THIS GENERAL PERMA NENCE OF SPECIAL OPTICAL PROPERTIES SUBJECT TO MUCH MODIFICATION THUS THE DIFFERENCE IN THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF SOME ISOMERIC BODIES SHOWS THAT SUCH A GENERALIZATIEN CANNOT BE STRICTLY TRUE AGAIN WE MAY EXAMINE THE DIFFERENT CASES OF REPLACEMENT OF HYDROGEN BY OXYGEN MENTIONED ABOVE AND AS IN EACH CASE THE ATOMIC VOLUME OF THE SUBSTITUTIONDISPERSION AND SENSITIVENESS OF LIQUIDS 337 PRODUCT IS THE SAME OR NEARLY SO AS THE ATOMIC VOLUME OF THE PRIMARY COMPOUND THE COMPARISON IS PECULIARLY LEGITIMATE WE INFER AT ONCE THAT OXYGEN IN COMBINATION IS ACTUALLY MORE REFRACTIVE AND DISPERSIVE THAN HYDROGEN BUT THAT IF WE TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ITS MUCH HIGHER DENSITY ITS SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY IS LESS BUT WHEN WE COME TO COM PARE THE DIFFERENT CASES QUANTITATIVELY WE SEE THAT A GOOD DEAL DEPENDS ON THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE COMPOUND IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE EFFECT OF THE REPLACEMENT OF TWO EQUIVALENTS OF HYDROGEN BY TWO OF OXYGEN IS GIVEN BOTH WITH RESPECT TO REFRACTION AND DISPERSION THE SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY OF V IS TAKEN AS THE BEST EXPONENT OF THE INFLUENCE OF REFRACTION AND ZPA DIVIDED BY DENSITY IS ASSUMED AS BEFORE FOR THE

SPECIFIC REFRACTIVE ENERGY IN THE CASE OF ALCOHOL THAN IN THAT OF THE ESSENTIAL OIL WHILE IN SPECIFIC DISPERSION IT HAS PRODUCED A REDUCTION IN THE ONE CASE AND AN AUGMENTATION IN THE OTHER AS THE

AND SENSITIVENESS OF LIQUIDS PS RECEIVED MALY 28IT WAS NOT TILL AFTER THIS PAPER WAS READ THAT WE BECAME AWARE OF THE EXISTENCE OF AN ELABORATE TREATISE BY DR SCHRAUF  ON THE DEPENDENCE OF THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT ON THE DENSITY OF BODIES IN POGGENDORFFS ANNALEN CXVI 193 IN WHICH HE INVESTIGATES THE QUESTION MATHEMATICALLY TAKING AS THE BASIS OF HIS CALCULA TIONS OUR FORMER EXPERIMENTS AND THOSE OF DEVILLE WEISS AND OTHERS OUR OWN LINE OF THOUGHT HAS MANY POINTS OF ANALOGY WITH THAT PURSUED BY HIM BUT THERE IS THIS DIFFER A2  1 B  V2  1 X ENCE IN THE CONCLUSION HE BELIEVES THAT D AND JD OR IN OUR NOTATION D AND D BEING THE DENSITY ARE THE CONSTANTS AT ALL TEMPERATURES AND ARE THE FUNCTIONS ON WHICH DEPEND THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF MIXTURES WHILE WE ARE LED BY OUR NEW EXPERI MENTS TO ACCORD THAT QUALITY RATHER TO D AND TO DOUBT ANY SUCH SIMPLE FORMULA AS DX FOR THE CHANGES OF DISPERSION TO THIS POINT WE PROPOSE TO RECUR AT SOME FUTURE PERIOD IF WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY THERE IS ONE POINT IN REFERENCE TO OUR METHOD OF OBSERVATION WHICH SEEMS TO CALL FOR A REMARK SCHRAUF THINKS THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE REFRINGENT ANGLE OF OUR PRISM ON ITS BEING HEATED NOW OUR HOLLOW PRISM HAS GLASS ENDS AS WELL AS GLASS SIDES BUT SUPPOSING SUCH A CHANGE ACTUALLY OCCURS IT IS EVIDENT IT WILL PRODUCE A UNIFORM ERROR RUNNING THROUGH ALL OUR OBSERVATIONS IN SECTION I THIS MAY BE THE REASON WHY AT HIGH TEMPERATURES THE OBSERVED IS ALMOST ALWAYS LESS THAN THE CALCULATED INDEX BUT AS BISULPHIDE OF CARBON AND WATER AGREE SO CLOSELY WITH EITHER HIS OR OUR THEORY THIS SOURCE OF ERROR MUST BE EXTREMELY MINUTE WE AWAIT WITH CURIOSITY THE PUBLICATION OF THE EXPERIMENTS REFERRED TO IN DR SCHRAUFS SHORT NOTE  ON THE VELOCITY OF LIGHT AND CHEMICAL COMPOSITION IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF POGGENDORFFS ANNALEN 343

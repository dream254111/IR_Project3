V JACKMAN 41 ATL 347 THE SUPREME COURT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HOLDS THAT A MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE REQUIRING ABUTTING LOT OWNERS TO REMOVE SNOW FROM THE SIDEWALK ADJOINING THEIR PREMISES THOUGH EXPRESSLY AU THORIZED BY THE CITY CHARTER IS UNCONSTITUTIONAL AS LAYING AN UNEQUAL BURDEN ON LOT OWNERS AS TAKING PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC USE WITHOUT COMPENSATION AND AS A DENIAL OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS THE OPINION BY BLODGETT J IS A STRONG ONE AND THE CASE WILL PROBABLY BECOME A LEADING ONE ON THAT SIDE OF THE QUESTION SAYS THE COURT THE ABUTTING LOT OWNER  HAVING CONTRIBUTED HIS PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF THE PUBLIC EXPENSE OF KEEPING THE HIGHWAY IN A SUITABLE CONDITION FOR THE PUBLIC TRAVEL WE ARE NOT AWARE OF ANY CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH MOREVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER CAN BE LAWFULLY EXACIED OF HIM NOR SHOULD THERE BE A PROPERTY OWNER HAS NO OTHER OR GREATER RIGHT IN OR TO OR CONTROL OVER THAT PART OF THE PUBLIC STREET IN FRONT OF HIS PROPERTY THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE HIGHWAYS OF THE TOWN ALL THE STREETS OF A MUNICIPALITY ARE EQUALLY FREE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC WHO AT ALL TIMES ARE EN TITLED TO THE FREE AND UNOBSTRUCTED USE OF EVERY FOOT OF THEM 2 DILL MUN CORP 3D ED SECS 659 683 IT IS TRUE THAT THE FEE OF THE STREET MAY BE AND GENER ALLY IS IN THE ADJOINING LOT OWNER BUT THIS CAN BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE THE EASEMENT OVER IT IS IN THE PUBLIC THIS BEING SO IT IS PLAIN THAT THE LOT OWNER HAS NO OTHER INTEREST IN THE STREET AS SUCH THAN ANY OTHER CITIZEN OF THE MUNICIPALITY THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SIDEWALK IT IS A PART OF THE STREET SET APART FOR THE EX CUSIVE USE OF PERSONS TRAVELLING ON FOOT AND IS AS MUCH UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT AS THE STREET ITSELF THE OWNER OF THE ADJACENT LOT IS UNDER NO MORE OBLIGATION TO KEEP THE SIDEWALK FREE FROM OBSTRUCTIONS THAN HE IS THE STREET IN FRONT OF HIS PREMISES HE MAY NOT HIMSELF OBSTRUCT EITHER SO AS TO IMPEDE TRAVEL ON FOOT OR IN CARRIAGES IT WILL BE CONCEDED THE CITIZEN IS NOT BOUND TO KEEP THE STREET IN FRONT OF HIS PREMISES FREE FROM SNOW OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT MIGHT IM PEDE TRAVEL THEN UPON WHAT PRINCIPLE CAN HE BE FINED FOR NOT REMOVING SNOW OR OTHER OBSTRUCTION FROM THE SIDEWALK IN WHICH HE HAS NO INTEREST OTHER THAN WHAT HE HAS IN COMMON WITH ALL OTHER PERSONS RESIDENT IN THE CITY IT IS CERTAINLY NOT UPON THE PRINCIPLE UNDER WHICH ASSESSMENTS ARE MADE AGAINST THE OWNER FOR BUILD ING SIDEWALKS IN FRONT OF HIS PROPERTY THE CASES ARE NOT ANALOGOUS SUCH ASSESS MENTS ARE MAINTAINED ON THE GROUND THE SIDEWALK ENHANCES THE VALUE OF THE PROP ERTY AND TO THE EXTENT OF THE

TAXATION WHICH OBTAINS IN THIS JURISDICTION FOR THE UNCONSTITUTIONALITY OF UNEQUAL TAXA TION IS TOO PLAINLY DECLARED BY OUR CONSTITUTION AND TOO WELL SETTLED BY REPORTED DECISIONS MADE DURING THE LAST FIFTYTHREE YEARS TO BE DEBATABLE BOSTON C  M RR V STATE 60 N H 87 94 AND UNDER THE CONSTITUTION    THERE IS NO WARRANT FOR THE IMPOSITION OF ANY OTHER TAX THAN ONE ASSESSED UPON A PRO PORTIONAL AND

EXPENSE FOR THE UNCONSTITU TIONALITY OF AN UNEQUAL DIVISION OF PUBLIC EXPENSE AMONG NEW HAMPSHIRE TAX PAYERS HAS BEEN SETTLED TOO LONG AND BY TOO MANY DECISIONS TO BE A SUBJECT OF DE BATE OR DOUBT ID 246 PER DOE C J TRUE THE ORDINANCE IS NOT STRICTLY A LAW LEVYING A TAX THE DIRECT OR PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF WHICH IS THE RAISING OF REVENUE IN RE GODDARD PETITIONER 16 PICK 504 BUT IT IS SUCH A LAW PRACTICALLY BOTH IN SUBSTANCE AND IN EFFECT AND SHOULD FAIRLY BE SO REGARDED THE AMOUNT OF EXPENSE FROM WHICH THE CITY IS RELIEVED BY THE OPERATION OF THE ORDINANCE IS EQUIVALENT TO SO MUCH REVENUE DERIVED FROM TAXA TION THE ADDITIONAL BURDEN TO WHICH THE LOT OWNERS ARE SUBJECTED IS NONE THE LESS A TAX BECAUSE IT IS EXACTED IN LABOR AND NOT IN MONEY PUB ST CH 73 SEC 8 BEFORE CITED COOLEY TAXN 12 AND THE FINE IMPOSED FOR ITS NONPERFORMANCE IS AS USEFUL TO THE CITY AS A TAX OF EQUAL AMOUNT COURTS ARE NOT BOULND BY MERE FORMS NOR ARE THEY TO BE MISLED BY MERE PRETENSES THEY ARE AT LIBERTYINDEED

M3UGLER V KANSAS 123 U S 623 8 SUP CT 273  BUT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE SO FAR AS THE DECISION OF THIS CASE IS CONCERNED WHETHER THE ORDINANCE IS OR IS NOT REGARDED AS A LAW LEVYING A TAX IT UNDENIABLY IMPOSES A DUTY AND OPERATES AS A LAW CREATING A BURDEN WHICH DOES NOT BEAR UPON ALL CITIZENS ALIKE AND WHICH MAKES AN UNEQUAL DIVISION OF PUBLIC EXPENSE AMONG TAXPAYERS IN DIRECT VIOLATION OF THE PRINCIPLE OF EQUALITY WHICH PERVADES THE EN TIRE CONSTITUTION AND TO WHICH ALL OTHER PURPOSES ARE INCIDENTAL AND SUBORDINATE STATE V PENNOYER 65 N H 113 114 18 ATL 878 AND NOT ONLY IS THE ORDINANCE A PALPABLE VIOLATION OF THE EQUALITY OF PRIVILEGE AND OF BURDEN GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION BUT IT IS THE TAKING OF PRIVATE PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC USE WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION AND A DENIAL TO THE PERSONS UPON WHOM IT OPERATES OF THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE FOURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION PROVIDING THAT NO STATE SHALL DEPRIVE ANY PERSON OF PROPERTY WITHOUT DUE PROCESS OF LAW NOR DENY TO ANY PERSON WITHIN ITS JURISDICTION THE EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE LAWS SEE SMYTH V AMES 18 SUP CT 418 424 425   IT WOULD SEEM UNNECESSARY TO GO FURTHER BUT THE ORDINANCE STANDS NO BETTER ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS AN EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER INHERENT IN ALL MUNICIPAL AND STATE GOVERNMENTS AND WHICH IT MAY BE CONCEDED PROPERLY EXTENDS TO THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC MORALS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE PUBLIC SAFETY BOSTON BEER CO V MASSACHUSETTS 97 U S 25 33 1MUGLER V KANSAS SUPRA NOBODY DOUBTS THAT WHEN AN OCCASION FOR ITS EXERCISE EXISTS THE POLICE POWER MAY BE INVOKED IN BEHALF OF THESE OBJECTS BUT IT IS ENTIRELY PLAIB THAT THE ORDINANCE HAS NO REAL OR SUBSTANTIAL RELATION TO ANY OF THEM IT IS NOT AN EXERCISE OF RESTRAINING OR PRO TECTIVE POWER LIKE THE DOG LAW SO CALLED OR THE STATUTE EMPOWERING TOWNS TO REQUIRE BUILDINGS TO BE PROVIDED WITH SUCH LADDERS AND BUCKETS AS MAY BE NECES SARY FOR USE IN CASE OF FIRE UNDER A PENALTY OF SIX DOLLARS FOR EVERY THREE MONTHS NEGLECT AND OTHER ENACTMENTS OF LIKE CHARACTER CITED BY THE STATE IT IS SIMPLY AN UNEQUAL DIVISION FOR ECONOMY AND CONVENIENCE ONLY OF PUBLIC EXPENSE AND PUBLIC BURDEN AMONG A CLASS OF TAXPAYERS WHO HAVE NOT ONLY ONCE CONTRIBUTED AND BORNE TLIEIR FULL SHARE AGREEABLY TO THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY BUT WHO ARE AGAIN RE QUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTION NOT PROPORTIONATELY AND ACCORDING TO THE VALUATION OF THEIR PROPERTY OR THE BENEFITS THEY RECEIVE BUT DISPROPORTIONATELY AND SOLELY AC CORDING TO THE LENGTH OF THE STREET LINES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE LOTS THIS IS EXTORTION AND INEQUALITY PURE AND SIMPLE AND IT IS NOTHING ELSE SEE CURRY V SPENCER 61 N H 624 631 632   A PURELY PUBLIC BURDEN CANNOT BE LAID UPON A FEW INDIVIDUALS AS HERE AT TEMPTED BY AN ORDINANCE OR BY ANY OTHER ENACTMENT NOR CAN PUBLIC EXPENSE BE APPORTIONED AMONG THEM ARBITRARILY DISPROPORTIONABLY AND WITHOUT REGARD TO THE VALUE OF THEIR PROPERTY NOR CAN THEY BE SUBJECTED TO DOUBLE TAXATION IN WHATEVER FORM IT MAY BE DISGUISED OR BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR THE ACTION OF THE ELEMENTS WHICH THEY COULD NOT CONTROL AND TO THE PRODUCTION OF WHICH THEY DID NOT EVEN THEORETICALLY CONTRIBUTE IT IS TRUE NEVERTHELESS THAT IN SEVERAL OF THE STATES ALL THESE THINGS ARE HELD TO BE RIGHT AND PROPER AS A LEGITIMATE EXERCISE OF THE POLICE POWER IN RE GODDARD PETITIONER 16 PICK 504 VILLAGE OF CARTHAGE V FREDERICK 122 N Y 268 25 N E 480 OR THE POWER TO REMOVE NUISANCES MAYOR ETC V MAYBERRY 6 HUMPH 368 BUT EVEN THE POLICE POWER COMPREHENSIVE AS IT AD MITTEDLY IS HAS ITS LIMITATIONS AND IN THIS STATE AT LEAST IT IS SUBORDINATE TO THE550 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER DEC EQUALITY OF PRIVILEGE AND OF BURDEN SECURED BY THE BILL OF RIGHTS AND GUARANTEED BY THE CONSTITUTION IN CLEARLYEXPRESSED PROVISIONS WHICH MEAN JUST WHAT THEY DECLARE AND IN THE PROPOSITION THAT IN THE EXERCISE OF A POWER TO REMOVE NUI SANCES A PRIVATE INDIVIDUAL MAY BE COMPELLED TO REMOVE AN OBSTRUCTION TO TRAVEL WHICH HE DID NOT CREATE FROM PREMISES OVER WHICH HE HAS NO CONTROL AND WHICH IT IS THE STATUTORY DUTY OF THE MUNICIPALITY TO KEEP FREE FROM OBSTRUCTION WE FAIL TO DISCOVER ANY MERIT EXCEPT THAT OF NOVELTY    IF ONE PUBLIC BURDEN MAY BE SHIFTED FROM THE PUBLIC AND CAST UPON A CERTAIN CLASS OF PROPERTY OWNERS UPON CONSIDERATIONS OF ECONOMY OR CONVENIENCE OR PE CULIAR INTEREST ACTUAL OR SUPPOSED OTHERS MAY AND DOUBTLESS WILL BEFOR IT IS A FAMILIAR FACT THAT THE CORPORATE CONSCIENCE IS EVER INFERIOR TO THE INDIVIDUAL CON SCIENCE THAT A BODY OF MEN WILL COMMIT AS A JOINT ACT THAT WHICH EVERY INDI VIDUAL OF THEM WOULD SHRINK FROM DID HE FEEL PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE BUT IT CAN NOT BE DONE IN THIS JURISDICTION UNTIL THE CONSTITUTIONAL RESERVATIONS AND GUARANTIES INTENDED AS A PROTECTION OF THE SUBJECT AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND OF THE WEAK SUBJECT AGAINST THE POWERFUL SUBJECT ARE REGARDED AS GLITTERING GENERALITIES MERELY AND THE REPORTED DECISIONS OF THREE GENERATIONS OF COURTS ARE REVERSED THAT TIME MAY COME BUT IT HAS NOT YET ARRIVED

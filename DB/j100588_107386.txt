J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107386,OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE TO THE NEAR AND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIFFERENT PERSONS,I206968,C 31 IV OBSERVATIONS RELATIVE TO THE NEAR AND DISTANT SISGHT OF DFFERENT PERSONS BY JAMES WARE ESQ F R S READ NOVEMBER 19 18I2 TH E FACT THAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS MOST COMMONLY COMMENCES AT AN EARLY PERIOD OF LIFE AND DISTANT SIGHTEDNESS GENERALLY AT AN ADVANCED AGE IS UNIVERSALLY ADMITTED EXCEPTIONS HOW EVER TO THESE RULES SO FREQUENTLY OCCUR THAT I FLATTER MYSELF A BRIEF STATEMENT OF SOME OF THE COINCIDENT CIRCUMSTANCES AT TENDANT ON THESE DIFFERENT IMPERFECTIONS IN VISION MAY NOT BE FOUND WHOLLY UNDESERVING THE ATTENTION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY NEAR SIGHTEDNESS USUALLY COMES ON BETWEEN THE AGES OF TEN AND EIGHTEEN THE DISCOVERY OF IT MOST COMMONLY ARISES FROM ACCIDENT AND AT FIRST THE INCONVENIENCE IT OCCASIONS IS SO LITTLE THAT IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THE IMPERFECTION WOULD REMAIN ALTOGETHER UNNOTICED IF A COMPARISON WERE NOT INSTITUTED WITLI THE SIGHT OF OTHERS OR IF THE EXPERIMENT WERE NOT MADE OF LOOKING THROUGH A CONCAVE GLASS AMONG PERSONS IN THE IN FERIOR STATIONS OF SOCIETY MEANS ARE RARELY RESORTED TO FOR CORRECTING SLIGHT DEFECTS OF THIS NATURE AND INDEED I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THE IMPERFECTION IN SUCH PEOPLE IS NOT UNFRE QUENTLY OVERCOME BY THE INCREASED EXERTIONS THAT ARE MADE BY THE EYE TO DISTINGUISH DISTANT OBJECTS THIS HOWEVER IS NOT THE CASE IN THE PRESENT DAY WITH PERSONS IN THE HIGHER RANKS OF LIFE WHEN THESE DISCOVER THAT THEIR DISCERNMENT OF DISTANT OBJECTS IS LESS QUICK OR LESS CORRECT THAN THAT OF OTHERSIMR WARES OBSERTATIONS OTZ THE NEAR THOTUGH THE DIFFERENCE MAY BE VERY SLIGHT INFLUENCED PERILAPS BY FASHION MORE THAN BY NECESSITY THEY IMMEDIATELY HAVE RECOURSE TO A CONCAVE GLASS THE NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF WHICLI IS THAT THEIR EYES IN A SHORT TIME BECOME SO FIXED IN THE STATE REQUIRING ITS ASSISTANCE THAT THE RECOVERY OF DISTANT VISION IS RENDERED AFTERWARDS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF NOT QUITE IMPOS SIBLE WITH REGARD TO THE PROPORTION BETWEEN THE NUMBER OF NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS IN THE DIFFIERENT RANKS OF SOCIETY I HAVE TAKEN PAINS TO OBTAIN SATISFACTORY INFORMATION BY MAKING IN QUIRY IN THOSE PLACES WHERE A LARGE NUMBER IN THESE SEVERAL CLASSES ARE ASSOCIATED TOETHER I HAVE INQUIRED FOR INSTANCE OF THE SURGEONS OF THE THREE REGIMENTS OF FOOT GUARDS WHICH CONSIST OF NEARLY TEN THOUSAND INEN AND THE RESULT HAS BEEN THAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AMONG THE PRIVATES IS ALMOST UTTERLY UNKNOWN NOT HALF A DOZEN MEN HAVE BEEN DISCHARGED NOR HALF A DOZEN RECRUITS REJECTED ON ACCOUNT OF THIS IMPERFECTION IN THE SPCE OF NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND YET MANY PARTS OF A SOLDIERS DUTY REQUIRE HIM TO HAVE A TOLERABLY CORRECT VIEW OF DISTANT OBJECTS AS OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE FUGLEMAN IN EXERCISE AND OF THE BULLS EYE WHEN SHOOTING AT THE TARGET THE WANT OF WHICH MIGHT TFURNISH A PLAUSIBLE APOLOGY FOR A SKULKER TO SKREEN HIMSELF FROM DUTY OR TO GET HIS DISCHARGE FROM THE SERVICE I PURSUED MY INQUIRIES AT THE MILITARY SCHOOL AT CHELSEA WHERE THERE ARE THIRTEEN HUNDRED CHILDREN AND I FOUNDTHAT THE COMPLAINT OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS HAD NEVER BEEN MADE AMONG THEM UNTIL I MENTIONED IT AND THERE WERE THEN ONLY THREE WHO EXPERIENCED THE LEAST INCONVENIENCE FROM IT AFTER THIS I INQUIRED AT SEVERAL OF THE COLLEGES IN OXFORD AND CAMBRIDGE AND THOUGH THERE IS A GREAT DIVERSITY IN THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO MAKE USE OF GLASSES IN THE VARIOUS TG AND DISTANT SIGHT OF DFFERENT PERSONS COLLEGES THEY ARE USED BY A CONSIDERABLE PROPORTION OF THE WHOLE NUMBER IN BOTH UNIVERSITIES AND IN ONE COLLEGE IN OXFORD I HAVE A LIST OF THE NAMES OF NOT LESS THAN THIRTYTWO OUT OF ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTYSEVENWHO WORE EITHER A HAND GLASS OR SPECTACLES BETWEEN THE YEARS 1803 AND 1807 IT IS NOT IMNPRO BABLE THAT SOME OF THESE WERE INDUCED TO DO IT SOLELY BECAUSE THE PRACTICE WAS FASHIONABLE BUT I BELIEVE THE NUMBER OF SUCH IS INCONSIDERABLE WHEN COMPARED WITH THAT OF THOSE WHOSE SIGHT RECEIVED SOME SMALL ASSISTANCE FROM THEM THOUGH THIS ASSISTANCE COULD HAVE BEEN DISPENSED WITH WITHOUT INCONVE NIENCE IF THE PRACTICE HAD NOT BEEN INTRODUCED THE MISFOR TUNE RESULTING FROM THE USE OF CONCAVE GLASSES IS THIS THAT THE NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS NOT ONLY FIXED BY IT BUT A HABIT OF INQUIRY IS INDUCED WITH REGARD TO THE EXTREME PERFECTION OF VISION AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS FREQUENT CHANGES ARE MADE FOR GLASSES THAT ARE MORE AND MORE CONCAVE UNTIL AT LENGTH THE NEAR SIGHTEDNESS BECOMES SO CONSIDERABLE AS TO BE RENDERED SERI OUSLY INCONVENIENT AND AFFLICTING IT SHOULD BE REMEMBERED THAT FOR COMMON PURPOSES EVERY NEAR SIGHTED EYE CAN SEE WITH NEARLY EQUAL ACCURACY THROUGH TWO GLASSES ONE OF WHICH IS ONE NUMBER DEEPER THAN THE OTHER AND THOUGH THE SIGHLT BE IN A SLIGHT DEGREE MORE ASSISTED BY THE DEEPEST OF THESE THAN BY THE OTHER YET ON ITS BEING FIRST USED THE DEEPEST NUMBER ALWAYS OCCASIONS AN UNEASY SENSATION AS IF THE EYE WAS STRAINED IF THEREFORE THE GLASS THAT IS MOST CONCAVE BE AT FIRST EMPLOYED THE EYE IN A LITTLE TIME WILL BE ACCOMMO DATED TO IT AND THEN A GLASS ONE NUMBER DEEPER MAY BE USED WITH SIMILAR ADVANTAGE TO THE SIGHT AND IF THE WISH FOR EN JOYING THE MOST PERFECT VISION BE INDULGED THIS GLASS MAY SOON BE CHANGED FOR ONE THAT IS A NUMBER STILL DEEPER AND SO MDCCCXIII F 33MR WAREUS OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR IN SUCCESSION UNTIL AT LENGTH IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN A GLAS SUFFICIENTLY CONCAVE TO AFFORD THE ASSISTANCE THAT THE EYE REQUIRES ALTHOUGH NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS IN GENERAL GRADUAL IN ITS PRO GRESS INSTANCES OCCASIONALLY OCCUR OF ITS EXISTENCE IN A CON SIDERABLE DEGREE EVEN IN CHILDREN IN WHOM IT IS SOMETIMES DISCOVERED ALMOST AS SOON AS THEY BEGIN TO TAKE NOTICE OF THE OBJECTS AROUND THEM THIS MAY BE OCCASIONED BY SOME DE GREE OF OPACITY IN THE TRANSPARENT PARTS OF THE EYE BUT SUCH A CAUSE OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS EASILY DISCOVERED BY AN EXAMI NATION AND IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THAT STATE OF THE EYE TO WHICH THE TERM MYOPIA OR NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS USUALLY APPLIED BY WHICH IS SIMPLY MEANT TOO GREAT A CONVEXITY EITHER IN THE CORNEA OR IN THE CRYSTALLINE IN PROPORTION TO THE DISTANCE OF THESE PARTS FROM THE RETINA IN SUCH CASES OF EXTREME NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IN CHILDREN IT IS SOMETIMES NECESSARY TO DEVIATE FROM A RULE WHICH IN SLIGHTER CASES I ALWAYS FOLLOW OF DIS COURAGING THE USE OF SPECTACLES  SINCE WITHOUT THEIR ASSISTANCE IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO PROSECUTE THEIR LEARNING WITH EASE OR CONVENIENCE EXTREME NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS SOMETIMES OCCASIONED BY AN EVIDENT CHANGE IN THE SPHERICAL FIGURE OF THE CORNEA AND ITS ASSUMPTION OF A CONICAL SHAPE THIS MORBID STATE OF THE COR NEA IS NOT ONLY PRODUCTIVE OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS BUT WHEN THE X I HAVE OBSERVED THAT MOST OF THE NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS WITH WHOM I HAVE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF CONVERSING HAVE HAD THE RIGHT EYE MORE NEAR SIGHTED THAN THE LEFT AND I THINK IT NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO EYES HAS BEEN OC CASIONED BY THE HABIT OF USING A SINGLE CONCAVE HANDGLASS WHICH BEING MOST COM MONLY APPLIED TO THE RIGHT EYE CONTRIBUTES AGREEABLY TO THE REMARK ABOVEMENTIONED TO RENDER THIS EYE MORE NEAR SIGHTED THAN THE OTHER 24AND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIFERENT PERSONS PROJECTION IS CONSIDERABLE VISION IS S MUCH CONFUSED THAT IT AFFORDS LITTLE OR NO SERVICE AND CANNOT BE AMENDED BY ANY GLASS THE CORNEA IN MOST OF THESE CASES IS PRETERNATURALLY THIN AND NOT UNFREQUENTLY IT IS ACCOMPANIED WITH SYMPTOMS OF GENERAL DEBILITY UNDER WHICH LAST CIRCUMSTANCE CHALYBEATE MEDICINES AND BRACING APPLICATIONS TO THE EYE HAVE BEEN FOUND TO AFFORD CONSIDERABLE BENEFIT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS TO AN ALARMING DEGREE HAS SOMETIMES ATTACKED YOUNG PERSONS SUDDENLY A REMARKABLE CASE OF THIS KIND CAME UNDER MY NOTICE A FEW YEARS AGO IN A YOUNG GENTLEMAN AT WESTMINSTER SCHOOL WHO HAD BEEN ATTENDED BY SIR GEORGE BAKER AND MR SUTHERLAND ON ACCOUNT OF A VARIETY OF ANOMALOUS NERVOUS SYMPTOMS THESE HAD WHOLLY LEFT HIM BEFORE I WAS CONSULTED AND THE CONSULTATION WITH ME WAS SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER HE MIGHT BE PERMITTED TO MAKE USE OF CONCAVE GLASSES AND TO RETURN TO THE BUSINESS OF THE SCHOOL THE PATIENTS HEALTH AT THAT TIME NOT BEING PERFECTLY RESTORED IT WAS THOUGHT AD VISEABLE TO SEND HIMN FOR A FEW WEEKS INTO THE COUNTRY AND TO POSTPONE THE USE OF GLASSES THIS ADVICE WAS FOLLOWED BUT IN TEN DAYS THE AFFLICTED YOUTH DIED SUDDENLY NO ANATOMICAL EXAMINATION OF THE HEAD WAS PERMITTED BY THE RELATIVES IT SEEMS HOWEVER PROBABLE THAT THE NEAR SIGHTEDNESS AS WELL AS THE PREVIOUS INDISPOSITION NO LESS THAN THE DEATH OF THE PATIENT WERE OCCASIONED BY THE PRESSURE OF A MORBID SUB STANCE OF SONME KIND OR OTHER ON THE SOURCE OF THE NERVES IN THE BRAIN NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS SELDOM ALIKE IN THE TWO EYES AND A FEW CASES HAVE COME UNDER MY OBSERVATION IN WHICH ONE EYE OF F2 35MR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR THE SAME PERSON HAS HAD A NEAR AND THE OTHER A DISTAT SIGHT IT HAS BEEN SAID BY DR PORTERFIELD THAT THE PUPILS OF NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS ARE MORE DILATED THAN THOSE OF OTHERS THIS HOWEVER DOES NOT ACCORD WITH THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE IN SUCH CASES IT HAS ALSO BEEN COMMONLY BELIEVED THAT THE SIZE OF THE PUPIL IS INFLUENCED BY THE DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT TO WHICH THE ATTENTION IS DIRECTED THIS APERTURE BEING ENLARGED WHEN THE OBJECT IS FAR OFF AND BECOMING MORE AND MORE CONTRACTED AS IT IS BROUGHT NEAR BUT THOUGH THE ACTIVITY OF THE FIBRES OF THE IRIS IS SOMETIMES SUFFICIENT TO BE VISIBLY INFLUENCED BY THIS CIRCUM STANCE YET IN THE GREATER NUMBER EVEN OF THOSE CASES WHERE THE DILATATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE PUPIL ARE POWERFULLY IN FLUENCED BY A DIFFERENCE IN THE STRENGTH OF THE LIGHT THE DIS TANCE OF THE OBJECT CONSIDERED ALONE PRODUCES SO LITTLE EFFECT UPON IT AS TO BE SCARCELY PERCEIVED THAT IT HAS HOWEVER IN GENERAL SOME DEGREE OF POWER ON THE PUPIL IS HIGHLY PRO BABLE AND AN EXTRAORDINARY INSTANCE OF THIS KIND EXISTS AT THE PRESENT TIME IN A LADY BETWEEN THIRTY AND FORTY YEARS OF AGE THE PUPIL OF WHOSE RIGHT EYE WHEN SHE IS NOT ENGAGED IL READING OR IN WORKING WITH HER NEEDLE IS ALWAYS DILATED VERY NEARLY TO THE RIM OF THE CORNEA BUT WHENEVER SHE LOOKS AT A SMALL OBJECT NINE INCHES FROM THE EYE IT CONTRACTS WITHIN LESS THAN A MINUTE TO A SIZE NEARLY AS SMALL AS THE HEAD OF A PIN HER LEFT PUPIL IS NOT AFFECTED LIKE THE RIGHT BUT IN EVERY DEGREE OF LIGHT AND DISTANCE IT IS CONTRACTED RATHER MORE THAN IS USUAL IN OTHER PERSONS THE VISION IS NOT PRECISELY ALIKE IN THE TWO EYES THE RIGHT EYE BEING IN A SMALL DEGREE NEAR  TREATISE ON THE EYE AND THE MANNER OF VISION VOL II P 38 006AID DISTANT SIGHT OF DFFERENT PERSONS SIGHTED AND RECEIVING ASSISTANCE FROM THE FIRST NUMBER OF A CONCAVE GLASS WHEREAS THE LEFT EYE DERIVES NO BENEFIT FROM IT THIS REMARKABLE DILATATION OF THE PUPIL OF THE RIGHT EYE WAS FIRST NOTICED ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AGO AND A VARIETY OF REMEDIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED AT DIFFERENT TIMES WITH A VIEW TO CORRECT IT BUT NONE OF THEM HAVE MADE ANY ALTERATION IT SHOULD BE MENTIONED THAT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE THE CONTRACTION OF THE PUPIL THE OB JECT LOOKED AT MUST BE PLACED EXACTLY NINE INCHES FROM THE EYE AND IF IT BE BROUGHT NEARER IT HAS NO MORE POWER TO PRO DUCE THE CONTRACTION THAN IF IT WERE PLACED AT A REMOTER DIS TANCE IT SHOULD ALSO BE MENTIONED THAT THE CONTINUANCE OF THE CONTRACTION OF THE PUPIL DEPENDS IN SOME DEGREE ON THE STATE OF THE LADYS HEALTH SINCE THOUGH ITS CONTRACTION NEVER REMAINS LONG AFTER THE ATTENTION IS WITHDRAWN FROM A NEAR OB JECT YET WHENEVER SHE IS DEBILITATED BY A TEMPORARY AILMENT THE CONTRACTION IS OF MUCH SHORTER DURATION THAN WHEN HER HEALTH IS ENTIRE DR WELLS IN HIS INGENIOUS PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE SECOND PART OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR THE YEAR  SEVERAL INSTANCES HAVE COME UNDER MY NOTICE IN WHICH THE PUPIL OF ONE EYE HAS BECOME DILATED TO A GREAT DEGREE AND HAS BEEN INCAPABLE OF CONTRACTING ON AN INCREASE OF LIGHT WHILST THE PUPIL OF THE OTHER EYE HAS REMAINED OF ITS NATURAL SIZE IN SOME OF THESE THE EYE WITH THE DILATED PUPIL HAS BEEN TOTALLY DEPRIVED OF SIGHT THE DISORDER ANSWERING TO THAT OF A PERFECT AMANROSIS BUT IN OTHERS THE DILATATION OF THE PUPIL HAS ONLY OCCASIONED AN INABILITY TO DISTINGUISH MINUTE OBJECTS READING HAS BEEN ACCOMU PLISHED WITH DIFFICULTY AND CONVEX GLASSES HAVE AFFORDED VERY LITTLE ASSISTANCE THOUGH OBJECTS AT A DISTANCE WERE SEEN WITH LESS INCONVENIENCE THAN THOSE THAT WERE NEAR THESE ALSO APPEARED TO THE AFFECTED EYE MUCH LESS DISTINCT THAN TO THE OTHER MOST OF THE PERSONS TO WHOM I ALLUDE BAD BEEN DEBILITATED BY FATIGUE OR ANXIETY BEFORE THE IMPERFECTION WAS DISCOVERED IN THE SIGHT AND IN SOME IT HAD BEEN PRECEDED BY AFFTEC TIONS OF THE STOMACH ALND ALIMENTARY CANAL 57MR WARES OBSELVATIONS ON THE NEAR I81  HAS TAKEN PAINS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE POWER BY WHICH THE EYE IS ADJUSTED TO SEE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES DEPENDS IN ANY DEGREE ON THE FACULTY IN THE PUPIL OF DILATING AND CON TRACTING AND WHETHER ITS FIXED DILATATION HAS ANY INFLUENCE IN PREVENTING AN ACCURATE VIEW OF NEAR OBJECTS THIS LAST MEN TIONED EFFECT DR WELLS RELATES TO HAVE TAKEN PLACE REMARK ABLY IN THE CASE OF DR CUTTING WHOSE PUPIL BEING FIXED IN A DILATED STATE BY THE ACTION OF THE EXTRACT OF BELLADONNA PERFECT VISION OF A NEAR OBJECT WAS REMOVED AS THE DILATATION ADVANCED FROM SIX INCHES WHICH WAS THE NEAREST DISTANCE AT WHICH DR CUTTING COULD DISTINCTLY SEE THE IMAGE OF THE FLAME OF A CANDLE REFLECTED FROM THE BULB OF A SMALL THERMOMETER TO SEVEN INCHES IN THIRTY MINUTES AND TO THREE FEET AND A HALF IN THREE QUARTERS OF AN HOUR MY ELDEST SON WHO HAS A VERY EXTENSIVE RANGE OF VISION HAS MADE A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT ON HIS RIGHT EYE WITH A SIMILAR RESULT PREVIOUS TO THE APPLICA TION OF THE BELLADONNA HE COULD BRING THE APPARENT LINES ON AN OPTOMETER LIKE THAT IMPROVED BY DR YOUNG FROM THE INVENTION OF DR PORTERFIELD AND DESCRIBED IN THE PHI LOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR 18OO TO MEET AT FOUR INCHES FROM THE EYE AND BY DIRECTING HIS ATTENTION TO A MORE DISTANT POINT HE COULD PREVENT THEM FROM MEETING TILL THEY WERE SEVEN INCHES FROM THE EYE AFTER WHICH THEY CONTINUED APPARENTLY UNITED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE OPTOMETER WHICH WAS TWELVE INCHES HE COULD SEE THE IMAGE OF A CANDLE  THE TWO LINES THAT ARE PERCEIVED ON LOOKING THROUGH THE SLITS OF AN OPTOMETER CROSS EACH OTHER PRECISELY IN THE POINT FROM WHENCE THE RAYS OF LIGHT DIVERGE IN ORDER TO BE BROUGHT TO A FOCUS ON THE RETINA AND THEIR APPARENT UNION BEFORE AND AFTER THIS POINT IS OCCASIONED BY THE UNAVOIDABLE THICKNESS OF THE LINE DRAWN ON THE OPTOMETER 38AID DISTANT SIGHT OF DFFERENT PERSONS G9 REFLECTED FROM THE BULB OF A SMALL THERMOMETER FIVESIXTEENTHS OF AN INCH IN DIAMETER AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE INCHES AND THREE QUARTERS FROM THE EYE AND HE COULD ALSO SEE THE SAME IMAGE AT THE DISTANCE OF TWO FEET SEVEN INCHES THE BELLADONNA PRODUCED A CONSPICUOUS DILATATION OF THE PUPIL IN LESS THAN AN HOUR AFTER WHICH ON VIEWING THE APPARENT LINES ON THE OP TOMETER HE WAS UNABLE TO MAKE THEM MEET AT A NEARER DIS TANCE THAN SEVEN INCHES OR TO GAIN A DISTINCT IMAGE OF THE CANDLE REFLECTED BY THE BULB OF THE THERMOMETER NEARER THAN THLLIS DISTANCE BUT HE COULD DISCERN IT AT TWO FEET TEN INCHES FROM THE EYE WHICH WAS THREE INCHES FURTHER THAN HE WAS ABLE TO SEE IT BEFORE THE BELLADONNA WAS APPLIED DURING THE TIME OF THE EXPERIMENT ON THE RIGHT EYE THE LEFT EYE POSSESSED ITS USUAL RANGE OF VISION BUT THE SIGHT WHEN BOTH EYES WERE OPEN WAS RATHER CONFUSED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE UNEQUAL FOCI OF THE TWO EYES AND IT DID NOT BECOME CLEAR UNTIL THE PUPIL OF THE RIGHT EYE RECOVERED ITS USUAL POWER OF CONTRACTING WHICH POWER WAS NOT ACQUIRED TILL THE THIRD DAY AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLADONNA IT IS REMARKABLE THAT A DIFFERENT EFFECT IS SOMETIMES PRODUCED ON A NEAR SIGHTED EYE BY THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLADONNA FROM THAT WHICH IT HAS ON AN EYE THAT ENJOYS A DISTANT SIGHT DR WELLS MADE AN EXPERIMENT OF THIS KIND ON A FRIEND OF HIS WHO WAS NEAR SIGHTED AND HE INFORMS US IN THE PAPER ABOVE REFERRED TO THAT IN THIS INSTANCE THE NEAREST POINT OF PERFECT VISION WAS MOVED FORWARDS DURING THE DILATATION OF THE PUPIL WHILST ITS REMOTE POINT REMAINED UNALTERED I HAVE MADE A SIMILAR EXPERIMENT ON THE EYES OF SEVERAL SUCH PER SONS AND THOUGH IN TWO OF THESE THE RESULT APPEARED TO BE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY DR WELLS YETBMR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR IN THE GREATER NUMBER THEIR SIGHT LIKE THAT OF THOSE WHO WERE NOT MYOPIC HAS BECOME MORE DISTANT AS THE PUPIL BECAME MORE DILATEDIN ONE GENTLEMAN IN WHOM THE LINES OF THE OPTOMETER APPEARED TO MEET AT FOUR INCHES AND A QUARTER FROM THE EYE THE PUPIL IN HALF AN HOUR AFTER THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLADONNA BECAME COMPLETELY DILATED AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THE SIGHT AT FIRST WAS CONFUSED BUT BOTH ON THAT DAY AND FOR TWO DAYS AFTERWARDS IT WAS EVIDENTLY MORE DISTANT AND THE APPARENT LINES ON THE OPTOMETER COULD NOT BE MADE TO MEET NEARER THAN SEVEN INCHES FROM THE EYEIN A YOUNG LADY SEVENTEEN YEARS OF AGE WHOSE RIGHT EYE WAS SO NEAR SIGHTED THAT THE APPARENT LINES ON THE OPTOMETER MET AT TWO INCHES AND THREE QUARTERS FROM THE EYE THESE LINES WHEN THE PUPIL WAS DILATED WHICH TOOK PLACE IN A SMALL DEGREE IN LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR COULD NOT BE MADE TO MEET IN LESS THAN THREE INCHES AND A QUARTER AND ON THE FOLLOW ING DAY THE PUPIL BEING MORE DILATED THE LINES DID NOT MEET TILL THEY WERE AT THE DISTANCE OF NEARLY FOUR INCHESIN A THIRD INSTANCE VIZ THAT OF A LADY FORTYFIVE YEARS OF AGE WHO HAD BEEN REMARKABLY NEAR SIGHTED FROM HER IN FANCY AND FOR MANY YEARS HAD USED CONCAVE GLASSES OF THE FIFTEENTH NUMBER WHICH NUMBER IS GROUND ON EACH SIDE UPON A TOOL THE RADIUS OF WHICH IS ONLY THREE INCHES THE SIGHT WAS BECOME SO CONFUSED IN BOTH EYES THAT SHE SAW NOTHING DISTINCTLY AND WAS UNABLE TO READ LETTERS OF THE SIZE THAT ARE USED IN THE PRINTED TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY EITHER WITH OR WITHOUT A GLASS IN THIS CASE AFTER THE PUPILS HAD BEEN DILATED BY THE APPLICATION OF THE BELLA DONNA THE SIGHT WAS SO MUCH IMPROVED THAT SHE WAS ABLE TO READ A PRINT OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED SIZE AT THE DISTANCE 4AND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIFERENT PERSONS 41 OF TWO INCHES WITH EITHER EYE I DO NOT INSIST HOWEVER ON THE PRESENT CASE BECAUSE THOUGH THERE WAS NOT ANY VISIBLE OPACITY IN THE CRYSTALLINE THIS SOMETIMES EXISTS IN A SMALL DE GREE WITHOUT BEING PERCEPTIBLE EVEN TO AN ATTENTIVE OBSERVER AND IT MAY BE DOUBTED WHETHER THE AMENDMENT IN THE LADYS VISION WERE NOT OCCASIONED SOLELY BY THE RETRACTION OF THE IRIS FROM BEFORE A PART OF THE CRYSTALLINE THAT WAS NOT YET BECOME OPAQUE IT BEING WELL KNOWN THAT THE OUTER PART OF THIS LENS NOT UNFREQUENTLY RETAINS ITS TRANSPARENCY FOR SOME TIME AFTER AN OPACITY HAS COMMENCED IN THE PART THAT SURROUNDS ITS CENTRE IT IS EVIDENT THAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS HAS NO DEPENDENCE ON THE GREATER OR SMALLER DEGREE OF CONVEXITY POSSESSED BY THE COR NEA WHEN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE IS CONSIDERED ALONE SINCE THE LENGTH OF THE AXIS OF THE EYE FROM THE CORNEA TO THE RETINA AND THE GREATER OR SMALLER DEGREE OF CONVEXITY IN THE CRYSTAL LINE HUMOUR MUST BE ALSO REGARDED BEFORE THE DISTANCE OF ACCURATE VISION CAN BE DETERMINED IT IS NO LESS EVIDENT THAT NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS NOT NECESSARILY OCCASIONED BY A MORBID PROTRUSION OF THE WHOLE EYE SINCE SOME PERSONS ARE BORN WITLL EYES OF THIS DESCRIPTION AND OTHERS ACQUIRE THE PECULIARITY WHEN FURTHER ADVANCED IN LIFE IN CON SEQUENCE OF A MORBID ACCUMULATION OF ADES AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORBIT WITHOUT EITHER OF THEM BEING MORE NEAR SIGHTED THAN THOSE WHO ARE FREE FROM THIS IMPERFECTION I HAVE SEEN MANY INSTANCES IN WHICH OLD PERSONS WHO HAVE BEEN LONG ACCUSTOMED TO USE CONVEX GLASSES OF CONSIDERABLE POWER HAVE RECOVERED THEIR FORMER SIGHT AT THE ADVANCED AGE OF EIGHTY OR NINETY YEARS AND HAVE THEN HAD NO FURTHER NEED OF THEM DR PORTERFIELD WAS OF OPINION THAT IN SUCH CASES MDCCCXII G4IS MR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR THE AMENDMENT IS OCCASIONED BY A DECAY OF ADEPS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORBIT IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE EYE FROM A WANT OF THE USUAL SUPPORT BEHIND IS BROUGHT BY THE PRESSURE OF THE MUSCLES ON ITS SIDES INTO A KIND OF OVAL FIGURE IN WHICH STATE THE RETINA IS REMOVED TO ITS DUE FOCAL DISTANCE FROM THE FLAT TENED CORNEA BUT IF A MORBID ABSORPTION OF ADEPS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE ORBIT WERE SUFFICIENT TO RESTORE THE PRESBYOPIC TO A GOOD SIGHT IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED THAT A MORBID ACCUMULATION OF ADEPS IN THIS PART WOULD PRODUCE A PRESBYOPIC OR DISTANT SIGHT THIS HOWEVER HAS NOT HAPPENED IN ANY OF THE CASES THAT HAVE COME UNDER MY NOTICE ON THE CONTRARY IN SOME SUCH PERSONS A DEGREE OF NEAR SIGHTEDNESS HAS BEEN IN DUCED BY THE ACCUMULATION AND IN OTHERS THE SIGHT WITH REGARD TO DISTANCE HAS NOT BEEN AFFECTED BY IT IT APPEARS TO ME MORE PROBABLE THAT THIS REMARKABLE REVOLUTION IN THE SIGHT OF OLD PERSONS IS OCCASIONED BY AN ABSORPTION OF PART OF THE VITREOUS HUMOUR IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE SIDES OF THE SCLEROTICA ARE PRESSED INWARD AND THE AXIS OF THE EYE BY THIS LATERAL PRESSURE IS PROPORTIONABLY LENGTHENED AN ALTERA TION OF THIS KIND IS ALSO SUFFICIENT TO EXPLAIN THE REASON WHY SUCH AGED PERSONS RETAIN THE POWER OF DISTINGUISHING OB JECTS AT A DISTANCE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THEY RECOVER THE FACULTY OF SEEING THOSE THAT ARE NEAR SINCE THE LENGTHENED AXIS OF THE EYE LEAVES THE POWER BY WHICH IT IS ADJUSTED TO SEE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES PRECISELY IN THE SAME STATE IN WHICH IT WAS BEFORE THE LENGTHENING OF THE AXIS TOOK PLACE  DR YOUNG IN THE PAPER TO WHICH I ALLUDED IN PAGE 38 HAS DESCRIBED A GREAT NUMBER OF INGENIOUS EXPERIMENTS DEVISED BY HIM TO SHEW THAT THE FACULTY OF SEEING AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES IS PRODUCED BY A POWER IN THE CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR TO BECOME MORE OR LESS CONVEX ACCORDING AS THE OBJECT IS MORE OR LESS DISTANT FROM THE EYEAND DISTANT SIGHT OF DFERENT PERSONS 45 ALTHOUGH OLD PERSONS LOSE THE POWER OF DISTINGUISHING COR RECTLY NEAR OBJECTS AND REQUIRE FOR THIS PURPOSE THE AID OF CONVEX GLASSES THEY USUALLY RETAIN THE SIGHT OF THOSE THAT ARE DISTANT AS WELL AS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG INSTANCES HOWEVER ARE NOT WANTING OF PERSONS ADVANCED IN LIFE WHO REQUIRE THE AID OF CONVEX GLASSES TO ENABLE THEM TO SEE NEAR AS WELL AS DIS TANT OBJECTS DR WELLS IS ONE OF THESE HE INFORMS US IN THE PAPER TO WHICH I HAVE MORE THAN ONCE ADVERTED THAT WHEN TWENTY YEARS YOUNGER HE WAS ABLE WITH HIS LEFT EYE TO BRING TO A FOCUS ON THE RETINA PENCILS OF RAYS WHICH FLOWED FROM EVERY DISTANCE GREATER THAN SEVEN INCHES FROM THE COR NEA BUT AT THE AGE OF FIFTYFIVE HE REQUIRED NOT ONLY A CONVEX GLASS OF SIX INCHES FOCUS TO ENABLE HIM TO BRING TO A POINT ON THE RETINA RAYS PROCEEDING FROM AN OBJECT SEVEN INCHES FROM THE EYE BUT LIKEWISE A CONVEX GLASS OF THIRTYSIX INCHES FOCUS TO ENABLE HIM TO BRING TO A POINT PARALLEL RAYSTHERE ARE ALSO INSTANCES OF YOUNG PERSONS WHO HAVE SO DISPROPORTIONATE A CONVEXITY OF THE CORNEA OR CRYSTALLINE OR OF BOTH TO THE DISTANCE OF THESE PARTS FROM THE RETINA THAT A GLASS OF CONSI DERABLE CONVEXITY IS REQUIRED TO ENABLE THEM TO SEE DISTINCTLY NOT ONLY NEAR OBJECTS BUT ALSO THOSE THAT ARE DISTANT AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THE SAME GLASS WILL ENABLE MANY SUCH PER SONS TO SEE BOTH NEAR AND DISTANT OBJECTS THUS PROVING THAT THE DEFECT IN THEIR SIGHT IS OCCASIONED SOLELY BY TOO SMALL A CONVEXITY IN ONE OF THE PARTS ABOVEMENTIONED AND THAT IT DOES NOT INFLUENCE THE POWER BY WHICH THEIR EYES ARE ADAPTED TO SEE AT DISTANCES VARIOUSLY REMOTE IN THIS RESPECT SUCH PERSONS DIFFER FROM THOSE WHO HAVE HAD THE CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR REMOVED BY AN OPERATION SINCE THE LATTER ALWAYS REQUIRE A GLASS TO ENABLE THEM TO DISCERN DISTANT OBJECTS DIFFERENT FROM GSMR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR THAT WHICH THEY USE TO SEE THOSE THAT ARE NEAR THIS CIRCUM STANCE IN MY APPREHENSION AFFORDS A CONVINCING PROOF THAT THE CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR IS INDISPENSABLY NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE EYE TO SEE AT DIFFERENT DISTANCESIT IS ALSO WORTHY OF REMARK THAT PERSONS WHO HAVE HAD THE CRYSTALLINE HUMOUR REMOVED HAVE LESS POWER TO ASCERTAIN THE DISTANCE OF AN OBJECT WHEN THEY LOOK THROUGH A CONVEX GLASS THAN WHEN THEY VIEW IT WITHOUT THIS ASSISTANCE IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH SUCH PERSONS SELDOM MAKE USE OF GLASSES WHEN THEY ARE WALKING AND THE INCONVENIENCE OF GLASSES IS PARTICULARLY EXPERIENCED WHEN THEY DESCEND A FLIGHT OF STEPS OR PASS OVER UNEVEN GROUND NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS DO NOT APPEAR TO POSSESS THE SAME EXTENT OF VISION THAT IS ENJOYED BY THOSE WHO HAVE A DISTANT SIGHT BEING NEAR SIGHTED I HAVE REPEATEDLY ENDEAVOURED TO ASCERTAIN MY OWN RANGE OF VISION AND I FIND BY EXAMINING THE FOCUS OF MY RIGHT EYE THROUGH THE ABOVEMENTIONED OPTO METER THAT I SEE TWO CONVERGING LINES WHICH APPEAR TO MEET WITH VERY SLIGHT VARIATIONS AT THE DISTANCE OF THREE INCHES FROM THE EYE AND NO EFFORT I AM ABLE TO MAKE CAN KEEP THESE LINES UNITED FURTHER THAN THE DISTANCE OF FOUR INCHES AND A QUARTER THEY THEN SEPARATE AND CONTINUE TO DIVERGE WITH MY LEFT EYE THE LINES DO NOT APPEAR TO MEET NEARER THAN FOUR INCHES AND THEY CONTINUE UNITED AS FAR AS FIVE INCHES AND A QUARTER AFTER WHICH THEY ALSO SEPARATE AND DIVERGE SO THAT THE RANGE OF DISTINCT VISION IN ME DOES NOT EXTEND FURTHER THAN AN INCH AND A QUARTER IN EITHER EYE AND WITHIN THESE DIS TANCES I ALWAYS HOLD A BOOK WHEN I READI FIND ALSO THE FOLLOWING RULE FOR DETERMINING THE CONCAVITY OF THE GLASS THAT IS BEST ADAPTED FOR NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS TO BE PERFECTLY CORRECT WITH RESPECT TO MYSELF AND I BELIEVE IT MAY BE SAFELY 44AND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIERENT PERSONS 45 ADOPTED BY THOSE WHO FROM DISTANCE OR ANY OTHER CAUSE ARE UNABLE TO SUIT THEMSELVES AT THE SHOP OF AN EXPERT OPTICIAN THE RULE IS THIS MULTIPLY THE DISTANCE AT WHICH THE PERSON READS WITH EASE WHICH WITH MY LEFT OR BEST EYE IS FIVE IN CHES BY THAT AT WHICH HE WISHES TO READ WHICH MAY BE SAID TO BE TWELVE INCHES DIVIDE THE PRODUCT SIXTY BY SEVEN THE DIFFER ENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND IT LEAVES NEARLY NINE INCHES FOR THE FOCUS OF THE CONCAVE GLASS THAT SHALL PRODUCE THE DESIRED EFFECT THIS IS THE EXACT CONCAVITY OF THE GLASS THAT I AM OBLIGED TO USE TO ENABLE ME TO READ WITH EASE AND IT ANSWERS TO THAT SOLD UNDER THE NAME OF NO 6 WHICH I AM INFORMED BY MR BLUNT THE OPTICIAN IS A DOUBLE CONCAVE GLASS GROUND ON A TOOL OF EIGHT INCHES RADIUS ON ONE SIDE AND ELEVEN INCHES ON THE OTHER THE MEAN BETWEEN WHICH IS VERY NEARLY NINE INCHES WITH A GLASS OF THIS DESCRIPTION I CAN READ THE SMALLEST PRINT BUT TO DISTINGUISH DISTANT OBJECTS I AM OBLIGED TO LOOK THROUGH THAT DENOMINATED NO 9 BY OPTICIANS WHICH IS GROUND ON A TOOL OF NINE INCHES RADIUS ON BOTH SIDES IN THIS RESPECT MY EYE HAS VARIED FROM WHAT IT WAS A FEW YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS ABLE TO DISTINGUISH BOTH NEAR AND DISTANT OBJECTS CORRECTLY THROUGH NO 8 THIS IS GROUND TO A RADIUS OF EIGHT INCHES ON ONE SIDE AND SIX INCHES ON THE OTHER AND WITH IT I CAN STILL READ A TYPE LIKE THAT IN WHICH THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY ARE PRINTED BUT AM UNABLE TO DISTINGUISH THROUGH IT MANY DISTANT OBJECTS WHICH I FORMERLY USED TO SEE DISTINCTLY HENCE IT APPEARS THAT MY EYES HAVE A CONFINED RANGE OF DISTINCT VISION EXTENDING ONLY TO AN INCH OR AN INCH AND A QUARTER AND THAT THEY REMAIN NEARLY IN THE SAME STATE IN WHICH THEY WERE MANY YEARS AGO WITH REGARD TO NEAR OB JECTS BUT HAVE LOST A PART OF THE POWER WHICH THEY FORMERLYMR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR POSSESSED OF ADJUSTING THEMSELVES TO DISTANT ONES IN THIS LAST RESPECT THEY DIFFER FROM THE EYES OF THOSE WHO HAVE NATURALLY A DISTANT SIGHT SINCE AS SUCH PERSONS ADVANCE IN LIFE THEY USUALLY RETAIN THE POWER OF DISTINGUISHING DISTANT OBJECTS BUT LOSE THAT OF SEEING THOSE THAT ARE NEAR IT APPEARS TO MILI TATE ALSO AGAINST THE COMMON OBSERVATION THAT AS NEAR SIGHTED PERSONS GROW OLDER THEY BECOME LESS NEAR SIGHTED SINCE MY EYES ON THE CONTRARY ARE MORE NEAR SIGHTED AT THE AGE OF FIFTYFIVE THAN THEY WERE AT TWENTYFIVE AND I AM NOW OBLIGED TO EMPLOY DEEPER CONCAVE GLASSES THAN I THEN USED TO SEE DISTANT OBJECTS THOUGH I AM NOT ABLE TO SEE DISTINCTLY THROUGH THEM THINGS THAT ARE NEAR THE ALTERATION WHICH HAS TAKEN PLACE IN MY RANGE OF VISION I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE IS NOT UNUSUAL DR WELLS IN HIS PAPER ON THIS SUBJECT MENTIONS THE CASE OF A GENTLEMAN WHO LIKE ME WAS NEAR SIGHTED AND WHOSE SIGHT AS HE AD VANCED IN LIFE HAD UNDERGONE A SIMILAR CHANGETHE FOL LOWING IS ALSO AN INSTANCE OF THIS KIND THAT IS STILL MORE REMARKABLE MR L SIXTYSIX YEARS OF AGE WHO HAS SPENT A GREAT PART OF HIS LIFE IN THE WEST INDIES AND WHOSE SIGHT WHEN HE WAS YOUNG ENABLED HIM TO SEE BOTH NEAR AND DISTANT OBJECTS WITH GREAT PRECISION BEGAN AT THE AGE OF FORTY TO EXPERIENCE A DIFFICULTY IN READING AND WRITING HIE IMMEDI ATELY PROCURED CONVEX SPECTACLES OF THE FIRST NUMBER SOLD BY OPTICIANS WHICH GLASSES ARE USUALLY GROUND TO A FOCUS OF FORTYSIX OR FORTYEIGHT INCHES AND BY THE AID OF THESE HE CONTINUED TO READ AND WRITE WITH EASE DISTINGUISHING PER FECTLY IN THE USUAL WAY ALL DISTANT OBJECTS WITHOUT THEM UNTIL HE WAS FIFTY AT THIS TIME HE FIRST BEGAN TO PERCEIVE AN IN DISTINCTNESS IN THE APPEARANCE OF THINGS AT A DISTANCE AND ONAND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIFERENT PERSONS TRYING WITH DIFFERENT GLASSES HE DISCOVERED THAT BY LOOKING THROUGH A DOUBLE CONCAVE GLASS OF THE SIXTH NUMBER WHICH IS GROUND TO A RADIUS OF EIGHT INCHES ON ONE SIDE AND ELEVEN INCHES ON THE OTHER HE WAS ENABLED TO SEE DISTANT OBJECTS DISTINCTLY HE HAS CONTINUED TO USE GLASSES OF THIS DESCRIPTION FOR THE PURPOSE OF SEEING DISTANT OBJECTS FROM THAT TIME TO THE PRESENT BUT IS OBLIGED TO REMOVE THEM WHENEVER HE READS AND STILL TO EMPLOY THE FIRST NUMBER OF A CONVEX GLASSIN THIS INSTANCE A PRESBYOPIC WAS CHANGED TO A MYOPIC SIGHT WITHOUT ANY KNOWN EFFICIENT CIRCUMSTANCE TO PRODUCE ITIN THE TWO FOLLOWING CASES A SIMILAR CHANGE TOOK PLACE AND IN THEM IT WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO KNOWN CAUSES A WOMAN ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE OF A FULL HABIT WHO FOR SEVERAL YEARS HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO MAKE USE OF CONVEX GLASSES IN ORDER TO READ A SMALL PRINT WAS SEIZED WITH A DIMNESS IN THE SIGHT OF THE RIGHT EYE AC COMPANIED WITH A SMALL DEGREE OF INFLAMMATION THE SIGHT OF THE LEFT EYE HAVING BEEN LONG IMPERFECT THIS AFFECTION OF THE RIGHT EYE OCCASIONED A GREAT DEPRESSION OF SPIRITS RECOURSE WAS NECESSARILY HAD TO COPIOUS EVACUATIONS BY MEANS OF WHICH THE INFLAMMATION AND DIMNESS OF SIGHT WERE SOON REMOVED BUT AFTERWARDS THE PATIENT WAS MUCH ALARMED ON FINDING THAT THE SPECTACLES SHE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO WEAR INSTEAD OF AFFORDING THEIR USUAL ASSISTANCE CONFUSED HER SIGHT UPON THIS DISCOVERY SHE WAS INDUCED TO LOOK THROUGH HER HUSBANDS GLASSES WHICH IN CONSEQUENCE OF HIS BEING NEAR SIGHTED WERE DOUBLE CONCAVES OF THE FIFTH NUMBER AND GROUND TO A RADIUS OF ELEVEN INCHES ON EACH SIDE THESE DID NOT AS SIST HER IN LOOKING AT NEAR OBJECTS BUT BY THEIR AID SHE SAW MUCH MORE DISTINCTLY THOSE THAT WERE DISTANT AND ON ATTEMPT ING TO READ NOTHING MORE WAS NOW NECESSARY THAN TO BRING48 MR WARES OBSERVATIONS ON THE NEAR THE BOOK A LITTLE NEARER TO HER THAN SHE HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ACCUSTOMED TO PLACE ITTHE SECOND CASE OCCURRED IN A PATIENT ABOUT THE SAME AGE WHO IN THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR WAS AT TACKED WITH AN INFLAMMATION IN BOTH EYES BY THE USE OF LEACHES AND COOLING MEDICINES IT WAS SPEEDILY REMOVED AND AFTER WARDS SHE WAS MUCH GRATIFIED BY FINDING THAT THE NECESSITY FOR USING GLASSES WHEN SHE READ WHICH HAD EXISTED MANY YEARS WAS REMOVED AND THAT SHE COULD SEE BOTH NEAR AND DISTANT OBJECTS CORRECTLY WITHOUT ANY EXTRANEOUS HELP THE AMENDMENT IN THIS LADYS SIGHT CONTINUED HOWEVER ONLY A FEW WEEKS AFTER WHICH SHE WAS AGAIN OBLIGED TO USE THE SAME CONVEX GLASSES IN LOOKING AT SMALL NEAR OBJECTS WHICH SHE HAD USED BEFORE HER EYES BECAME INFLAMEDIN ADDITION TO THESE CASES I BEG LEAVE TO ADD THE INFORMATION I HAVE RE CEIVED FROM AN EMINENT MATHEMATICAL INSTRUMENT MAKER ABOUT FIFTY YEARS OF AGE WHO HAS LONG MADE USE OF CONVEX GLASSES TO ASSIST HIS SIGHT IN READING HE TELLS ME THAT WHEN HE HAS BEEN EMPLOYED MANY HOURS TOGETHER FOR SEVERAL SUC CESSIVE DAYS IN LOOKING THROUGH A DOUBLE MICROSCOPE THAT MAGNIFIES TWENTYEIGHT TIMES IN ORDER TO ENABLE HIM TO MARK THE DEGREES ON A SMALL BRASS PLATE HE HAS AFTERWARDS BEEN ABLE REPEATEDLY FOR A FEW WEEKS TO READ WITHOUT HIS GLASSES BUT THEN THE AMENENDMENT GRADUALLY CEASES AND HE IS SOON OBLIGED TO RETURN TO THE USE OF THE SAME GLASSES THAT HE HAD WORN BEFORE IN THE INSTANCES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED THE DISTANT SIGHT EDNESS AFFECTED PERSONS WHO WERE CONSIDERABLY ADVANCED IN LIFE BUT IN THE THREE THAT FOLLOW A SIMILAR AFFECTION OF THE SIGHT OCCURRED IN THOSE THAT WERE YOUNG AND A LIKE GOOD EFFECT WAS PRODUCED BY THE USE OF EVACUATING REMEDIES ONEAND DISTANT SIGHT OF DIFFERENT PERSONS 49 OF THESE WAS A BOY EIGHT YEARS OLD WHO SUDDENLY BECAME PRESBYOPIC AND HAD REPEATEDLY BEEN PUNISHED AT SCHOOL ON ACCOUNT OF HIS INCORRECT AND DEFACED WRITING THE REAL CAUSE OF IT AT THAT TIME BEING UNKNOWN TO HIS MASTER AFTER THE PRESBYOPIA HAD CONTINUED A FORTNIGHT AND DIFFERENT LOCAL AP PLICATIONS HAD BEEN USED WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY SENSIBLY GOOD EFFECTS THE LAD WAS CURED BY THE APPLICATION OF LEACHES TO THE TEMPLES AND THE ADMINISTRATION OF A FEW PURGATIVE MEDICINES THE OTHER INSTANCES OCCURRED IN TWO DAUGHTERS OF THE SAME FAMILY THE ELDEST TWENTY YEARS OF AGE HAD NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DO FINE WORK AND FOR THREE YEARS HAD BEEN GREATLY ASSISTED BY CONVEX SPECTACLES THE YOUNGEST A GIRL OF FIFTEEN HAD BE COME PRESBYOPIC ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND SINCE THAT TIME HAD BEEN OBLIGED TO USE SPECTACLES WHENEVER SHE READ OR WORKED WITH HER NEEDLE THE YOUNG PERSON LAST MENTIONED IN THE COURSE OF SIX WEEKS DURING WHICH TIME SHE TOTALLY ABSTAINED FROM THE USE OF GLASSES WAS COMPLETELY RELIEVED FROM THE NECESSITY OF USING THEM BY THE APPLICATION OF TWO LEACHES TO EACH TEMPLE TWICE IN A WEEK THE FORMER IN THE SAME SPACE OF TIME EXPERI ENCED MUCH RELIEF FROM A SIMILAR TREATMENT BUT WAS STILL UN ABLE TO DO FINE WORK WITHOUT GLASSES PARTLY IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE LONG CONTINUANCE OF THE INFIRMITY AND PARTLY ON ACCOUNT OF HER NOT HAVING ABSTAINED WITH EQUAL STEADINESS FROM THE OCCASIONAL USE OF THEM FROM THE PRECEDING STATEMENT THE FOLLOWING INFERENCES MAY BE DEDUCED FIRST NEAR SIGHTEDNESS IS RARELY OBSERVED IN INFANTS OR EVEN IN CHILDREN UNDER TEN YEARS OF AGE IT AFFECTS THE HIGHER CLASSES OF SOCIETY MORE THAN THE LOWER AND THE INSTANCES ARE FEW IF ANY IN WHICH IF THE USE OF CONCAVE GLASSES HAS BEEN MDCCCXIIIO HMR WARES OBSERVATIONS C ADOPTED INCREASING YEARS HAVE EITHER REMOVED OR LESSENED THIS IMPERFECTION SECONDLY THOUGH THE USUAL EFFECT OF TIME ON PERFECT EYES BE THAT OF INDUCING A NECESSITY TO MAKE USE OF CONCAVE GLASSES IN ORDER TO SEE NEAR OBJECTS DISTINCTLY YET SOMETIMES EVEN AFTER THE AGE OF FIFTY AND AFTER CONVEX GLASSES HAVE BEEN USED MANY YEARS FOR THIS PURPOSE THE EYES HAVE NOT ONLY CEASED TO DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THEM WHEN LOOKING AT NEAR OBJECTS BUT THEY HAVE REQUIRED CONCAVE GLASSES TO ENABLE THEM TO DIS TINGUISH WITH PRECISION OBJECTS AT A DISTANCE THIRDLY THOUGH THE CAUSE OF THIS CHANGE BE NOT ALWAYS KNOWN YET SOMETIMES IT HAS BEEN INDUCED BY THE USE OF EVA CUATING REMEDIES PARTICULARLY OF LEACHES APPLIED TO THE TEMPLES AND SOMETIMES BY LOOKING THROUGH A MICROSCOPE FOR A CON TINUED LENGTH OF TIME IN SEVERAL SUCCESSIVE DAYS FOURTHLY INSTANCES ARE NOT UNCOMMON IN WHICH PERSONS FAR ADVANCED IN LIFE VIZ BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY WHOSE EYES HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED FOR A LONG TIME TO THE USE OF DEEPLY CONVEX GLASSES WHEN THEY HAVE READ OR WRITTEN HAVE CEASED TO DERIVE BENEFIT FROM THESE GLASSES AND THEY HAVE BECOME ABLE WITHOUT ANY ASSISTANCE TO SEE BOTH NEAR AND DISTANT OBJECTS ALMOST AS WELL AS WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG ALTHOUGH IT BE NOT EASY TO ASCERTAIN THE CAUSE OF THIS AMENDED VISION IT SEEMS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT IT IS OCCASIONED BY AN ABSORPTION OF PART OF THE VITREOUS HUMOUR IN CONSEQUENCE OF WHICH THE SIDES OF THE EYE COLLAPSE AND ITS AXIS FROM THE CORNEA TO THE RETINA IS LENGTHENED BY WHICH ALTERATION THE LENGTH OF THIS AXIS IS BROUGHT INTO THE SAME PROPORTION TO THE FLATTENED STATE OF THE CORNEA OR CRYSTALLINE OR BOTH WHICH IT HAD TO THESE PARTS BEFORE THE ALTERATIOTL TOOK PLACE S

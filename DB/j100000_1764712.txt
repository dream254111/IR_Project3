logical Survey replied briefly Professor N S Shaler of Harvard spoke on  The Tertiary Deposits of Eastern Massachusetts In his paper Mr Shaler endeavored to show that in that district there had been since the miocene age a large amount of true mountain building action at Gay Head on Marthas Vineyard The evi dence of this had been distinguishable for a long time but about a year ago it was uncovered so that it could be better seen than at any previous time by a most violent rainstorm somewhat in the nature of a cloudburst In two hours time five and one half inches of water had fallen and the cliffs at Gay Head had been washed so much that opportunities for investigation were better than ever be fore A remarkable instance of dislocations had been exposed and the formation of the cliffs made plainly visible The evidences of mountainbuilding were plain and it was of a comparatively late period The same thing could be seen on Block Island Its limit to the north was sharply defined for the greensands of Marshfield Mass had been examined by Mr Shaler and they were perfectly horizontal and not disturbed To the south and west investigations had not been pushed so the extent of the mountainbuilding in that direction was unknown Mr Shaler said further that the evidences of glacial action were plain and that it must have taken place after the upheaval or mountainbuild ing age The second days session was opened with an address by the present president Professor James Hall geologist of the State of New York Professor Halls address was a sketch of the earlier geologists and was directed chiefly to the younger members of the society present He paid tributes among others to Agassiz Sir Charles Lyell Professor Logan the royal geologist of Canada and William Smith and closed with a reference to his colleague Professor Dana Professor Edward Orton State geologist of Ohio considered the Origin of the RockPressure of Natural Gas in the Trenton Limestone of Ohio and Indiana The gas is the product of ages which has been accumulated in the porous limestone of Ohio and Indiana It has been produced so slowly that when once ex hausted it will take many thousands of years for it to again accu mulate in sufficient quantities to be used even if the elements necessary for its production were present which he thought was not at all probable The pressure which forces the gas out with such tremendous power that it sometimes reaches Iooo pounds pressure per square inch is not due to the pressure of the gas it self but to the hydrostatic pressure brought to bear by the col umn of salt water that enters the porous stratum of rock contain ing the gas at the sealevel and which by its weight tends to force the gas out To the explanation and elucidation of this phenome non Professor Ortons paper was more especially devoted The men who are engaged in the practical development of gas and oil fields said he made great account of rockpressure It is the first fact they inquire after in a new gasfield They appreciate its im portance knowing that the distance of the markets they care to reach and the size of the pipes they can employ are entirely de pendent upon this element After discussing the theories of its origin he expressed the opinion that the gassupply could not be of very long duration This fact he regarded as of the greater im portance on account of the vast extent to which natural gas had become a factor in Western manufacture and development He said that 400000 people in northwestern Ohio and central Indiana alone depended upon it for fuel and illumination and that a large proportion of their manufactures depended upon it The supplies were being wasted in a vandal fashion and he thought that nine years at most would mark its duration in this region Artificial gas he believed preferable The next paper was by Professor William B Clark of Johns Hopkins University his subject being  The Tertiary Deposits of the Cape Fear River Region Professor Andrew C Lawson of Ottawa Canada next read a paper entitled  Note on the PrePalaeozoic Surface of the Archaean Terranes of Canada Professor William M Davis of Cambridge Mass presented the fourth paper on  The Structure and Origin

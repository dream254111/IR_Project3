Jou2N os PsYazoLoGs Vol III No 3 Sept 1890 I have described some of the macro scopic features of the brain in question I there stated the results of the measurements of the estent of the cortes 10G cit p 336 as follows Estent of cortes right hemisphere  989465 0 mm Estent of cortes left hemisphere  1012560 C1 mm Total estent of cortes 2002026 O mm It has been recognized by all those who have studied the e2atent of the the cortes that unless supplemented by ob servations on the thickness and character of the same the figures for extent did rlot give a good grourld for further infer ence Jensen45 is howerar the only investigator who has up to this time made his studies thus complete It is therefore my purpose to report the results of the es amination of the cortes of Laura Bridgman together with such conclusions as may be drawn from the results IThe thtckness of the cerebral cortex in general By way of preface I made a little e2rcursion into the literature of the corte2r to determine what was considered to be the normal thickness of that layer It is highly probable that some of thevork on this subjecthas escaped my notice but what was found is tabulated Table I  with the purpose of showing how fully the various authors have stated the manner in which they obtained their results and what correc tions had to be made in certain cases in orderto have the results fairly

cortes of normal persons aZnd the second the fig ures that apply to defectives In this latter group I have only the measurements that apply to individuals with an ac quired defect as contrasted with those congenitally defective The literature bearing on the cortes in these last has been brought together by Marchand66 and though the facts are very interestillg they do not bear on our present problem and are therefore excluded The headings of the columns in Table I will explain them selves I trust and the Table maZy be examined now without further explanation Cmitting my own results there are but sis authors whose figures are of interest to us now The manner in which the final figures in these cases have been obtained requires some explanation We desire to know the thickness of the cortes in its natural state but the hardening reagents used for preserving the brain alter the thickness In another place I expect to make some general statements with regard to the weight and volume of nervous tissues as influenced by hardening rea gents Therefore I may state here only the results obtainedt viz that alcohol of 80 causes a decrease of 2fa in thef thickness of the corx while the bichromate and alcohot treatment potassium bichromate 20 plus W its volume of 9596 alcohol for 6 to 8 weeks washing in water for 24 hours alcohol 95 fO for 2 days and final preservation in 80 o alcohol causes an increase of 2fo as will be seen theseZ corrections have been applied in Table I Further the man ner of making the measurements has a very decided influence on the results Direct experiment showed that the same localities measured with the compasses gave a thickness 4Ne less than when measured with a micrometer eyepiece under the microscope There is no doubt in my mind that the microscopic method is the more accurate hence I have cor rected all the measurements made with compasses by the percentage above found There still remains the important question of the handlingON

was multiplied by 2 added to the larger figure and the sum divided by 3 As a consequence of this treatment I believe that my final average for the cor tes of any particular gyrus is nearer the truth than it would be if half the sum of the thickest and thinnest points had alone been taken The figures which will be most useful to us can now be taken from Table I and presented in Table II with the pur pose of showing whether there is any diiierence in cortical thickness between males and females or between the two hemispheres of the same brain whether defectives corres pond with normal persons and what may be regarded as the normal thickness of the cortes Since the figures given in the Table SI do not occur in their present form in the original tables of the authorities there quoted I should perhaps add a word of explanation on the method by which they have been obtained252 DONALDSON Jensen46 gives a condensed statement for the normal brains asld in Table II his figures are simply corrected for the effect of alcohol and the use of compasses in measuring His tables for the defectives are fuller and permit us to deter mine the averages for the two hemispheres These are cor rected in the manner above mentioned In no case did he measure the cortes of the insula A mong the defectives one case which he gives is not entered in the table because it is that of a microcephalic Bucknill and Tuke57 give without detail the thickness of the normal cortes as 08 in In a table of 63 pathological cases entered with great care and fullness one column is devoted to the thickness of the cortes also given without detail in hundredths of an inch This unit approsimately equal to 25 mm is rather large when employed in so deli cate a measurement No statement as to the number locality or method of their measurements is made The cases were a11 adults Conti59 gives full tables IIe claims twenty brains in his series The measurements on two brainsfemales are however so incomplete that they are not used here hence he is credited with but eighteen brains in the table Both hemi spheres were not always examined The total number of hemispheres represented in the table is only twentynine 16 right and 13 left His cases principally adults range in age from sisteen months to eighty years but there is no evidence that the youngest cases should be excluded Twentysis lo calities in each hemisphere were measured but the cortes for the insula if measured is not specially recorded In the pre rolandic and postrolandic regions only the summits of the gyri and the depths of the sulci were measured In the ro landic region intermediate measurements on each wall of the gyri were taken The averages were obtained by summing and dividing the figures as they stand in his tables and then correcting the final results for the use of compasses The original measurements were made in tenths of a millimeter Franceschin gives full and very complete tables He es amined the cortes at 35 localities on both hemispheres of twenty brains principally from adults of advanced age 10253 ON TEE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN males and 10 females The measurements taken in tenths of a millimeter and were made at the summits of the gyri and the depths of sulci The cortes of the insula was included The figures in Table II are obtained directly from those of his tables save that they have been corrected for use of compasses Major64 tested the thickness of the cortes at thirty locali ties on both hemispheres of the brains of four adult insane patients the ses not given For each locality he gives only the mean depth using onefifth of an inch as his unit of measure This unit is of course too large IIe measured the insular cortes His figures for the cortical thickness give the mean depth without detail as to the method of obtaining the mean The instrument used the tephrylometer consisted of a thin walled graduated glass tube This was pressed into the brain substance at any desired point then the upper end being closed by the finger withdrawn when a plug of brain substance remained within the tube and on this plug the thickness of the cortes is read off by the aid of the scale etched in the tube The figures in Table II are the simple averages of those in his tables without any corrections Con cerning the accuracy of this method of measuring the cortes there are no observations Cionini65 presents his reslllts from the examination of fif teen adult brains ten males five females all cases of general paralysis The number of localities was 31 but in other re spects the details are similar to those in the case of Conti It occurs however that in five cases three males and two fe males the tables are so incomplete that they cannot be used for averages and hence only ten cases are represented The figures in Table II are obtained as in the case of Conti A glance at Table II shows that in both normals and defec tives the average thickness is very slightly  01 to 04mm greater in the males in five out of the si2 cases larger number underlined There is a slightly greater difference between the two hemispheres which is in favor of the left hemis phere as the figures stand eight out of thirteen cases In discussing the absolute thickness of the cortes as reported we have of course to throw out the defectives who are ipso facto expected to have a thinner

moment I have no explanation to offer of the various figures given for the absolute thickness in normal persons and will simply point out that my figures agree most closely with those of Jensen It appears therefore that the average thickness for the two seses is nearly alike mhat difference there is being in favor of the males that the left hemisphere more often has the thicker cortes that in defectives not congenital it is thinner than in normal persons and that the figures given for the absolute thickness in normal persons are at present irreconcilable With this I conclude the introductory study of the subject II Comparison of the cortex of Laura Bridgman with Xhat of nine normal brains six males three females The normal brains were obtained in New York about a year ago and I am indebted to the courtesy of several medi cal gentlemen of the city for them There is no reason to think that any of these specimens were from persons of more than average intelligence hence on that score they are com parable with the Bridgman brain They were hardened in the same manner that the latter was vtde p 9 Samples dof cortes were taken in all cases from 14 localitiesoneach hemisphere each locality being designated by an arbitrary number Plate III shows the localities with the numbers used and is intended to take the place of a written description In Table III I give the cortical areas in which the localities are situated All the samples from the several localities were treated in the same manner viz imbedded in celloidin cut in sections about Ol mm thick and measured

Donaldson normals and in Table IV a fllrther analysis is given The figures for males and females being separated in Table IV those for the right and left hemispheres are given in each group and the

generally low with a special depression at 10 and from 12 to the end they run at different levels It will be sen at a glance that these two curves are fairly accordant until locality 11 is reached IIere they are widely divergent approach somewhat at 8 again to diverge at 14 Taking up the peculiarities of the Bridgman cortes then in the order in which they occur we find the insula 3 thinner on the left side Both sides very thin at 6 the auditory area Locality 2 the area for motor speech is welldeveloped on both sides From 4 to 13 the development is poor specially so at 10 area for taste and smell At 12 the area for dermal sensations the curve is zigh again and from that point on commences the remarkable divergence in the curves of the two hemispheres that for the left side being much higher at 11 8 and 14 all of which are within the visual area Referring now to the description which I have previously given op cit of the macroscopic features of this brain I may brieily attempt to collate them with the measurements of tine corte2r259 ON THE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN The insula 3 on the left side was found less well devel oped It has the thinner cortes Vtde Waldschmidt67 At the auditory area 6 I could not decide on anymacroscop ic defect but have since determmined that the first temporal gyrus at its caudal end especially on the right side was abnor mally slender The cortes is decidedly thin on both sides most markedly so on the right A t the area for motor speech theleft side showed a clear lack of development depression but the cortes was not particularly thin for this brain At 10 the area for taste and smell there was a general lack of development eshibited by the entire temporal lobe This is easily explained by the slow growth of this portion of the brain a growth which was quite incomplete at the period when Laura was taken ill 2 years The glossopharyngeal nerves appeared normal but the olfactory bulbs and tracts were small though not so small as in the case of some normal per sons The thinness of the cortes at this point 10 appears therefore as a part of the general arrest in growth Passing now to the visual area it was noticed macroscopi cally that both occipital lobes were blunted but the right side turned out in every way to be much the more defective and anomalous Concordantly the cortes of this right side at 11 8 and 14 is much thinner than that of the left It must be recalled here that although at the age of two years Laura became completely blind in her left eye yet she retained some remnant of vision with her right eye up to her eighth year This has left its mark on the entire central ap paratus for vision The right optic nerve is larger than the left Area of crosssection of R optic nerve500 a mm      L    338   The relation in the tracts is of course reversed Area of crosssection of R optic tract313 a mnl i     L   469   On the one hand then we have loss of vision in left eye at 2 years of age associated with the smaller optic nerve and traca defectively developed right oceipital lobe and a thin cortes in the right visual area On the other hand we have some vision in the right eye up to the eighth year of age as sociated with the larger optic nerve and tract the more nor mal occipital lobe and the thicker cortes260 DONALDSON The gener31 thinning of the motor cortex I would e2rplain in part by the absence of the fibres through which the motor areas are normally associated writh the sensory areashere defective andin part by the smaller size of some of the cell elements and nondevelopment of others resulting from lack of stimuli The defects in tlhe visual and auditory area follow directly from the loss of the corresponding sense organs and conse quent arrest of growth When the loss is not at first com plete a good deal of subsequent development is possiblev Why the speechcentre has not a thinner corte2 I cannot at the moment explain In considering the fact that the sensory centers are much more aflected than the motor it should be rexnembered that aside from the special loss due to arrest and possibly degen eration falling less on the motor than on the sensory centres there is the physiological difference that each motor centres can be excited by way of any sensory centre and hence so long as any senses are left the motor centres must be stimu lated to some degree while the destruction of the special sense organ throws a given sensory centre quite out of function The physiological conditions in the two cases are therefore quite different and in favor of the development of the motor side For reference I introduce here several tables containing the details of the figures just given Table VII gives the masimum and minimum thickness of the corte2 as observed at eacn locality on LauraB Bridgman aBnd the nine controls The masimtlm waBs taken at the sum mit of the gyrus and the minimum at the side not at the bottom of the sulcus The averaBge of the masimum and minimum is obtained by

was not wel enough preserved to ad mit of a very fine microscopical examination Some points can be made ollt however on sections 02 mm thick stained with haematoxylin and eosin or hematoxylin and carminic acid or with WeigertPal hematoxylin Whatever general statements are made are always in comparison with the nine controls from which sectiotls were also cut and similarly stained The cells generally in the Bridgman cortet have abundant pigmenthe nuclei often somewhat irregular and the nucleoli sometimes single and clear often multiple and unclear and at times wanting Where the cortical granules form layers they appear abundant as a rule and immature i e without265 ON TEE BRAIN OF LAU1zA BRIDGMAN Sangles as though they had been arrested in their growth The general impression one gets is that the large nerve cells are neither so large nor so numerous as in the normal brains Of cell processes and abundance of fibres one can only say that there appear less of both in all localities and hasten to add that the poor condition of the material makes itself painfully felt at this point It seemed worth while however to select sections from several localities especially those in which the cortes of the Bridgman brain appeared thin and attempt to get some no tion of the development of the cell elements at these points To arrive at this result I counted the number of cells above a given diameter in a strip of the cortes comparing the num ber found in the Bridgman cortes with that in two controls For results see Table L TABLE X To show the average number of cells 12  in

It was examined with a Zeiss apochromatic objective 4 mm focus combined with the compensating eyepiece 6 tube 160 mm thus giving an enlargement of 375 diameters The eyepiece carried the micrometer with 50 divisions With the objective usedX each division had a value of 4 z1 The whole scale covered therefore 50 times 004 mm 2 mm Placing the micrometer scale so that it was at right angles to the direction of motion for the specimen and passing the specimen in review by means of the mechanical stage a strip of cortes 2 mm wide could be brought throughout its entire estent under the scale In this manner the nerve cells were sifted so to speak through the micrometer scale and each one that was 12 a or more in diameter was picked OU2G and counted In selecting the point on the section at which to make this test I always took the spot where the cells were apparently to a low power most abundant and in a11 cases everything in the field that could be counted was counted The depth of the cortex where the count was made wis multiplied by the constant width 2 mm and the total num ber of cells divided by this product using 01 sq mm as the unit The thickness of the section was always 02 mm which being a constant factor may be neglected By this treatment it comes out that about one cell 12 u or more in basal diameter normally occurs in each 01 sq mm of a sec tion 02 mm thick For comparison with the Bridgman sections I took those from Control III Brain weight 1393 gr male average thick sless of cortes R E 277 m L I 286 m and Control NI Brain weight I196 gr female average thickness of cortex R H 274 m L lI 274m see Table IV thus happen ing to get both the male and female with the thinnest cortes Table X shows that taking the average of both sides at no locality in the Bridgman brain are the large nerve cells as abun dant as in the controls The number in both the controls is nearly the sameON TEE BR A IN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN 267 Taking the matter more in detail the motor areas in Laura do not show as great a poverty of large cells as the sensory areas In three instances marked c in Table N the abundance of cells accords with the thickness of the cortes i e the thicker cortes has the larger number of cells These in stances include the ones in which the Bridgman corte2i most clearly deviates from the normals As in the measurements of cortical thickness so in the abundance of cells the Bridgman brain is clearly deficient at 6 the allditory area and in the right hemisphere at 11 and 14 visual area while in the left hemisphere some deficiency is to be noted only at 14 thus again bringing out the contrast be tween the occipital regions on the two sides Locality 10 has fewer cells than the controls but the difference is not so marked as in the thickness of the cortes In general it may be added that where the number of cells above 12  in basal diameter was small that there the abso lute number of large cells appeared smaller and the very largest cells not so large as in the controls In other words small number and small size of large cells appeared to be associated though I have no figures to present on the point If however my impression is correct then Table N only in part represents the difference in the developmentCof the cor tical cells of Laura as compared with the controls SUMM A RY I Generat 1 No figures can be given for the average thickness of the fresh normal cortes The various investigators differ widely in their results My own results agree most closely with those of Jensen 2 Persons with an acqllired defect of the central nervous system have a thinner corte2r than normal persons 3 Females have a slightly thinner corte2r than malesv Difference less than 1 4 The right hemisphere normally has a corte2r a few per cent less thick than the left Masimum difference 7  268 DON A LDSON II Speciat 1 The corte2r of Iaura Bridgman was abnormally thin having but 89 of the thickness of the controls If we sup pose that in its other dimensions the corte2r was similarly reduced in development i e by 11 in each linear meas urement then its normal e2rtent would have been 246808 sq mm instead of 2002025 sq mm as found This estimate is similar to some of those by the Italian observers Calori 48 and De PGegibus 17p 276 2 The right hemisphere had on the average the thinner corte2r specially to be associated with the defective

C GETCHELL M D Wol cester Description of the Specimen The specimen submitted for examination was a portion of the ethmoid bone esterlding from the anterior hase of the crta galli to the sphenoid bone a small part of the sphenoid being included in it It contained nearly all the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid At the sphenoidal end the lateral sur faces were devoid of mucous membrane towards the frontal end the surfaces were quite covered with the remains of mem brane in a ragged condition The right superior turbinated bone presented a smooth surface marked with grooves Be tween it and the perpendicular plate was mucous membrane Little of the left superior turbinated bone remained and that which did was rough and without grooves The entire speci men measured from the e2rtreme frontal to the sphenoidal end 3 cm from the ape2r of the crista to the farthest point on the perpendicular plate 22 cm laterally its greatest measurement was through the horizontal plate of the ethmoid S cm This line represented the base of two triangles the ape2r of one being the tip of the crista that of the other the farthest point on the perpendicular plate of the ethmoid The specimen had been hardened in BIullers fluid and de calcifiedin a saturated solution of picric acid the process being completed in a t solution of hydrochloric acid It was im bedded in celloidin and most of the sections were stained with Delafields hemato2rylin and eosine Four additional stains were used for nerves viz Upsons carminic acid Schsefers Iligrosine hematoxylin und carminic acid and Pals hmatosylin Pesutts of the Microscoptc Ezaminatzon For the purpose of comparison I obtained a specimen270 GETCHELL similar to the one under consideration This was a portion of the ethmoid bone taken from an elderly man who had been a patient at the Worcester Insane Asylum and had died there The presumption would be that this specimen could not be taken as a type of the normal for it is difflcult to suppose that one could pass the greater part of a long life in this climate without having had more or less nasal catarrh The specimen was however healthy in its gross appearance that is it was symmetrical both superior turbinated bones were present their stlrfaces were shiny and grooved the mucous membrane was generally and uniformly distributed between the perpendicular plate and the superior turbinated bones The next point to consider was its microscopic appearance and here arose the question What is our standard for the normalt The work in this region has been done mainly upon the lower animals and while the results obtained are in the main applicable to the olfactory region of the higher animals including man obviously it would be of great assistance to have wellconducted studies upon the oliactory region of man In an investigation upon the olfactory region of a case of leuksemia Hertnann Suchannek84 has touched upon this topic He has figured a microscopic section of the olfactory region of a man 40 years old with a normal sense of smell The picture agrees with the usual description of this region It represents a section consisting of a regular row of epithelial cells resting upon a basement membrane beneath which are many Bowmans glands a few blood vessels and nerves with little intertubular connective tissue Unfortunately no meas urements are given either of the entire mucous membrane or the epithelium My specimen presented a different appear ance The epithelial layer preserved for the most part its normal characteristics of a regular row of columnar cells rest ing upon a row of round cells the epithelial cells being well formed and distinct In many places however the surface was not so well defined but was breaking into crowded irregular masses of granular matter while the subjacent layer of round cells had disappeared and its place was taken by a mass of round cells which penetrated deeply the underlying tissue In these localities the surface layer of cells was thrown271 ON THE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN into folds which projected above the surface and also rami fied into the mucous membrane like glands Therewasagen eral increase of connective tissue The thickness of the entire mucous membrane varied from 16 mm to 88 mm Those localities that measured 16 mm taking as a standard the usual description and the figure of Suchannek were fairly normal The epithelium of these regions was particularly healthy The epithelial layer varied from 30si to 988 in thick ness Eolliker quoted by Schwalbe86 gives 408 to 98u as the normal thickness It wasthinnest at theextremevault of the elfactory fissure In the Bridgman sections the thickness of the mucous mem brane entirevariedfrom 16 mm to 64mm and the thickness of the epithelial layer from 488 to 908 Taking 16 mm as the thickness of the normal mucous membrane I fourld those areas of the mucous membrane that were of this thickness far from normal The surface of the epithelial layer was covered with thin granular matter arld the surface line was very irregular The cells took the stain poorly showing that they were degenerating into mucus In many places the cell bodies had entirely disappeared leaving a mere outline of their tormer structures The row of round cells had disappeared and its place was taken by a mass of cells now pushing up into the epithelial layer now invading the membrana limitans In the subepithelial tissue there was a dense deposit of corl nective tisslle In no part of the specimen was the epithelium healthy At some points the mucous membrane was en tirely devoid of epithelial cells at others there was the row of round cells now single now two or three deep In some placesthese cells were becoming polygonal in shape again over them was a crowded confused mass of irregular cells breaking away In some places there were breaks of continuity in the line of epithelial cells otherwise fairly regular in their size and distriblltion There were also places where the sur face of the mucous membrane was thrown into elevations There was generally a large increase of connective tissue which in some areas had replaced everything else In other areas was abundant infiltration of small round cells Bowmans glands were very irregularly distributed and varied272 GETCH1gTT much in their character They presented all gradations from a ring of fairly healthy polygonal cells to a confused mass of granular matter The mucous membrane on the right of the septum was much healthier than that on the left Its thickness was uniform though in some places there was an increased deposit of con nective tissue The curve irlto the vault of the olfactory fis sure was uninterrupted and regular throughout this side of the specimen The epithelial cells though individually under going degeneration were fairly regular in outline Bowmans glands were numerous in the frontal part of the specimen but toward the sphenoidal end they had disappeared Through out this area were nerves and bloodvessels with greatly thickened walls The left side of the specimen presented a very different picture In the frontal fifth of the olfactory fis sure was crowded a mass of connective tissuet in which were nerves bloodvessels glands covered ventrad with de generated epithelium Still ventrad to this the perpendicular plate was devoid of mucous membrane as was also that part of the superior turbinated bone which remained the greaterv part of this bone was either in small fragments or had entirely disappeared The remaining fourfifths of this side of the specimerl was occupied by a fibrous tumor which wasX as it were in a closed cavity the mucous membrane of the septum having firmly united with that of the superior turbinated bone giving in the sections the appearance of a ring lined with epithelium enclosing the tumor The tumor sprang from the septum and projected into the superior meatus Its length from its frontal to its sphenoidal end estimated by the num ber offsections in which it was found was upwards of 15 cm It was irregularly polygonal in shape and measured at its frontal end 112 mm in height that is from the septum to theJ apex of the tumor and 105 mm in breadth while at its sphenoidal end the corresponding measurements were 250 mm and 144 mm Its character changed from the frontal to the sphenoidal end In the frontal region it was made up of a central column of dense connective tissue which supported nerves blood vessels Bowmans glands the whole being cov ered with a layer of epithelium as healthy as that in any part273 ON TIIE BR A IN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN of ttle specimen At the sphenoidal end the central column was divided by a fissure Bowmans glands had disappeared and the whole tumor was filled with spaces of irregular shape many of them full of blood corpuscles Blood vessels remained but there were few nerves and the greater part of the tumor was devoid of epithelium The Xerves There were two varieties of nerves in the specimen a branch of the ophthalmic division of the fifth which passes into the nose through the fissure at the base of the crista galli and the olfactory nerves The branch of the fifth a medullated nerve was in the main normal The asis cylin ders stood out sharply throughout the greater part of the sections In some areas however they had lost this dis tinctness and showed signs of beginning degeneration But the change was no greater than might be expected in a woman of Lauras age Before entering upon the description of the olfactory nerves of this specimen it will be well to discuss briefly the normal and pathological anatomy of the olfactory nerve in general Thegenerally accepted view of the nonmedullated nerve of which the olfactory is a type is that it is made up of the socalled Remaks fibres Each of these consists of an asis cylinder a neurilemma and between the two a nucleated nerve corpuscle from place to place This fibre has a striated appearance due according to Max Schultze to the fibrillse of the nerve which are distinguished from the asis cylinders of a medullated nerve in that they individually have no medul lary sheath Boveri86 on the other hand has made a care ful study of this subject and concludes that the fibrillae of Mas Schultze are really nerve fibres each having a medulw lated sheath This sheath does not however belong exclu sively to each nerve It sustains the same relation to the contiguous nerve fibres that the cell wall of a honeycombW does to the cells A number of these nerves are surroundedk by an envelope of connective tissue in which are here and there stellate connective tissue corpuscles There are also within the investing sheath among the nerves connective 7274 GETaRErjr tissue aorpuscles with stellate rays which can be traced very far even to the enclosing sheath The olfactory nerves are subject to certain definite patho logical conditions In the first place they may be congen itally absent Injury to the head may cause rupture to the nerves as they pass through the cribriform plate Excessive stimulation may temporarily or permanently destroy their escitability Tumors in the brain or cerebral hemorrhage may by pressure cause disease of the olfactory nerves There may be atrophy of the bulb or nerves or they may be affected by the degenerative changes of old age Simple neuritis is a very rare affection Althaus 87 Chronic neuritis due to syphilis however is not uncommon The nerve may become involved in local inflammatory changes in connection with sneningitis Bosworth88 is of the opinion that a very frmuent cause of anosmia from diseases of the olfactory nerves is due to the influence of local inflammatory changes FThus in acute rhinitis anosmia persists many days after the inflammatory process undergoes resolution In severer disSe of the nose where the local inflammatory action per sts longer or i8 of a severer type the anosmia lasts much longer long after the inflammatory action has subsided To return to our specimen The nerves were numerous and were easily distinguished by moderate powers of the microscope 320 diameters To get some definite ides of the distribution of the nerves in the different parts of the specimen I selected five slides and counted the nerves on them Oneof these sections was from the frontal end one Eroi the sphe noidal the other three at regular intervals between them I also made a count of the nerves of the control specimen under similar conditions with the following results The slide pumbered one in each eae was from the frontal end Bridgman Control lst slide 1 nerve 1st slide 4 nerves 2nd  7  2nd  20  3rd  28  3rd  10  4th  32  4th  8  5th  18  Ith  16  Total 86 Total 57275 ON TEE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN This enumeration is of interest in that it shows the dis tribution of the nerves in the different parts of the specimens but it gives no reliable information as to the relative number of nerves in the two specimens It is a difficult matter even under favorable conditions to stain the olfactory nerves so as to show the nerve fibres In neither of these specimens was I able to show the olfactory nerves with the special stains for nerve tissue The only stain that brought them out at all was the heematoxylin and eosine which did it by virtue of its differentiating the connective tissue We shall see that this latter was greatly increased in the Bridgman specimen and it is evident that because of this many more nerves would be deteeted than in the healthier specimen In the Bridgman slides the nerves were surrounded by a ring of connective tissue which was very thick Within this ring was a uniformly granular field broken up into smaller areas and more or less studded with deeply stained dots With a 1lf oil immersion objective these dots were seen to be stellate connective tissue corpuscles The areas alluded to above corresponded to the portions of the nerve bounded by the connective tissue envelope in Boveris sections Here as with his sections the connective tissue corpuscles were upon and within the sheaths Rather the connective tissue cor puscles of the sheath were where the sheath should be that place being represented in our sections by a vacant space bs this apparent shrinking was quite general throughout the specimen I attributed it to the action of reagents With this power the nerve presented a regularly mottled appear ance very similar to a section of a frogs olfactory nerve as figured by Boveri and representing according to his views the cut ends of the nerve fibres The nerve in its essential elements therefore was normal The connective tissue elements however were largely increased Generat Constderatzons It will be interesting now to gather together the available facts relating to Lauras sense of smell and the general con dition of her nasal mucous membrane during life and to find if we aan in the condition of this membrane an explanation of her symptoms276 GETCHELL As an infant she was delicate being subject to severe con vulsions But later her health improved and when two years old she is described as being more active and intelligent than ordinary children At two she had scarlet fever with such severity that for seven weeks she was unable to swallow solid food Both eyes and ears were aSected suppurating freely lp2 When seven years old she was seen by Dr R D Mussey Professor of Anatomy and Surgery at Dartmouth College and in a letter dated April 14 1837 he thus alludes to her sense of smell IIer sense of smell is thought by her mother to be less acute than other children as she very sel dom applies any odorous substance to her nose it is not improbable that this sense may have been impaired by the feverlIIl In this year 1837 she entered the Perkins Institution and we find in Dr IIowes report this note 21 For all purposes of use she is without smell and takes no notice of the odor of a rose or the smell of cologne water when held quite near her though acrid and pungent odors seem to affect the olfactory nerve April 6 1842 Miss Swift Lauras teacher made this note1P l07 Dr EIowe came into the room while she was having a lesson peeling an orange She stopped in the midst of a sentence to say I smell an orange We can see a decided improvement in her sense of smell since last year but she has never noticed any perfume so quickly or at so great a distance before June 19 1844 we find this notelP 257 This is the first season she has ever perceived the smell of a rose or pink and she now puts all flowers to her nose and is disappointed if they have no perfume In a letter to WIrs IIowe dated June 25 1844 Laura herself saysP 258 aI can smell roses much better than I did two years ago and it gives me much pleasure in smelling roses I find but few observations upon the general condition of her nose Dec 14 1843 ZIiss Swift made this noteIP 2l5 She has always been a sllfferer from a severe catarrhal affec tion and as this shows signs of improvement we hope for a corresponding one in both smell and taste In 1878 Dr G Stauley lIall in the course of a series of observations upon her several faculties e2aamined her nose with this result6277 ON THE BR A IN OF L A UR A BRIDGM A N There is no deformity or scarification observable without or from a cursory examination within the nose and the yellow pigment of the Schneiderian membrane can be seen by a very simple apparatus Dr lIall made further this very inter esting observation EIe described her sleeping with long regular breathing the teeth slightly apart and the tongue pressed against them and almost between them I have received the following leSter from Miss Della Ben nett who has been a teacher in the Perkins Institution since 1876 Laura Bridgman lived for several years in the same family with myself and I have conferred with the matron of the cot tage and can answer most of your questions definitely There was copious discharge from her nose so much so that she was wont to say My poor nose   EIer handkerchief was in frequent demand and she used many EIer breath was never offensive She always breathed through her nose a habit which she formed when quite young and her breathing was often accompanied with a gentle whistling sound I have seen her asleep in the daytime and her mouth was closed but I cannot tell about the night She did remove mucus from her throat and occasionally had a sore throat From these notes one gathers that at the age of two Laura suffered from a severe inflammation of the nasopharyns which doubtless estended to her nose that after her illness she was quite destitute of the sense of smell entirely so when at the age of eight she entered the Perkins Institution that at the age of fifteen she could detect with certainty and pleasure moderately pronouncedodors that she had a severe nasal aatarrh which lasted her entire life although it decreased somewhat in severity furthermore that there was no deform ity without or within the nose that could be seen by one not accustomed to examine these parts We now come to the consideration of the cause of Lauras anosmia and her partial recovery from it We have seen that the olfactory nerves were capable of performing their function and according to Dr Donaldson vide ante there was no central lesion that would cause anosmia We must therefore seek for the cause in the periphery of the nervous278 GETCHELL apparatus The two chief peripheral causes of anosmia are obstruction to the inspired air lue to deformity of the nose hypertrophy of the turbinated bodies nasal polypi or tumors and atrophic disease That there was not atrophic disease is shown by the absence of bad odor by the partial return of the sense of smell and by the result of our e2ramination of the specimen Furthermore according to Bosworth catarrhal affections caused by febrile diseases and prominently scarlet fever are characterized by hypertrophic changes 88 lb7 It is quite improbable that Laura had any deformity of the nose or hypertrophic disease in the respiratory part of the nose which would interfere very materially with the access of the inspired air to the olfactory region and it is in this lat ter region therefore that we must look for the cause of her anosmia We have found in the left superior meatus an adequate cause for a complete absence of the sense of smell for that area in the extensive disease there which resulted in a thorough disorganization of the mucous membrane in a part of the olfactory fissure while the rest was excluded from all con tact with the inspired air by the firm union of the mucous mem brane of the septum with that of the left superior turbinated body In the right superior meatus on the other hand con ditions were more favorable for the proper performance of function It is here that Laura must have smelled and the questions now to be settled are how could this area have been rendered incapable of performing its function and how could this function have been resumed Catarrhal inflammation of the nasal mucous membraneis the usual accorapaniment of scarlet fever except in the mildest cases and is associated with an irritating discharge from the nose Smith 89  The inammatory process in these cases does not involve more than the epithelial layers But in severe disease the deeper tissues of the mucous membrane are af fected There is a copious proliferation of cells in the deeper layers with fibrinous infiltration even to the e2atent of com pressing the vessels and making portions of the tissue gan grenous Henock9 There may even result necrosis of the bones Thomas91 There may be recoveryeven though the disease be severe or it may result in chronic disease with279 ON TEE BRAIN OF LAUR A BRIDGM A N more or less profuse discharge and e2rtensive inflammatory in filtration or there may be an osteitis of all the bones which enter into the composition of the nasal cavities  Allen92 That Lauras nasal mucous membrane was profoundly affect ed by the fever there seems no doubt andit is easyto conceive how the active cell proliferation and swelling of the mucous membrane caused by the catarrhal process would have so af fected the delicate termination of the olfactory nerves that they would be entirely incapable of functioning But as timewent on we know her catarrh grew better and we rightfully infer that the inflammatory processes in the mucous membrane subsided to an estent though they never entirely ceased We have seen that the structures of the nose were a good deal damaged yet they were not entirely useless In the right superior meatus especially there were spots of membrane in a fairly healthy condition A question of interest here presents itself would the olfactory nerves after so long a period of inactivity preserve their power of responding to stimulie The following case reported by Allen 92 proves that this is pos sible The patient was a married woman She had never breathed through her nose and had never experienced the perception of an odor There was found to be a complete bony occlusion of the posterior nares This was broken through and on the sisth day after the operation she began to smell and in a short time became familiar with the common odors and flavors The odoriferous air was not kept from Lauras olfactory nerves hy bony obstruction but it was kept from them by what acted as efficiently for a long time namely masses of rapidly proliferating cells and the mucus and debris of a diseased mucous membrane When this process subsided it again became possible in those areas where the ephithelium still remained sufficiently healthy as it did in places for the terminal filaments of the nerves to receive and convey their proper stimuli There may have been a further cause for the anosmia When discussing the pathology of the olfactory nerve we alluded to Bosworths view that anos mia was due in some cases to the local action of the surround ing inammation upon the nerve itself A s I understand the matter he bases this view solely upon clinical experience and attempts no explanation of the tardy return of the sense of280 GETCSTTZTjT smell after the subsidence of the inflammation We have in our sections apossible explanation of this peculiarity The connective tissue of the nerve was increased in amount while the nerve tissue proper was apparently normal Interesting questions suggest themselves in this connection Does the development of this tissue impair the functioning power of the nerve and does a nerve so affected resume its normal activity more slowly than the surrounding tissuet A t present so far as I know there is not sufficient anatomical data upon wvhich one could even discuss these topics Summary I The ethmoid bone and the mucous membrane covering it had suffered from inflammatory disease which particularly affected the left side 2 This disease resulted in an excessive production of connective tissue and in one area the left su perior meatus there had been formed a fibrous tumor The epithelium was generally and considerably diseased The nerves contained an excess of connective tissue but were otherwise normal 3 When two years old Laura had scarlet fever which left her anosmic and with severe nasal catarrh She partially recovered from both these conditions 4 The anosmia was due to the occlusion of the left olfactory area by the union of the mucous membraLke of the septum with that of the superior turbinated body and also to the action of the inflamed mucous membrane upon the nerves of the right olfactory region Partial recovery resulted from subsidence of this inflammation II The Visual Apparatus When Laurs recovered from her illness it appeared that she was totally blind in her left eye but could see somewhat with the right The remasat of vision in her right eye con tinued up to the eigthth year of her life From that time on she was absolutely blind in both eyes In 1878 Dr O F Wadsworth of Boston tested her for vision and found her totally blind 6 and at the same time reported on the appearance of the eyes as follows 0n both sides the lids are sunken partly on account of lack of the normal amount of orbital fatty tissue partly on account of the small size of the eyeballs They remain con stantly closed The right conjunctival sac is much smaller281 01f THE B1tAIN OF LAURX BRIDGMAN than normal somewhat irregular and presents an appearance such as is seen after severe and longcontinued inSlammation The right eye appears about one half the normal size It is wholly enclosed by the sclerotic except over a space at the acentre some two millimetres in diameter where a less opaque tissue on which a few bloodvessels are visible represents the altered remnant of the cornea The left conjuctival sac is somewhat larger than the right and more regular though still small The left globe also is a little larger than the right and its opaque altered cornea is some four millimetres in horizontal and two millimetres in vertical diameter There was constant irregular oscillation of the globes nystagmus whenever they were exposed to view by raising the lids and the oscillation evidently continued even after the lids were Yclosed  At the autopsy the eyes were removed with the surround ing tissue and put 1lnopened into the Mullers fluid and alcohol The hardening was completed in alcohol Both bulbs were enclosed by orbital fat All the muscles the of bulbs were present though small and the external ap pearance of the bulbs corresponded with Dr Wadsworths description given in 1878 After hardening the right eye had a transverse diameter of 15 mm and an anteroposterior diameter of 105 mm Similar measurements of the left eye gave 175 and 11 mm showing the left to be decidedly the larger The condition of phthisis bulbi existed for both eyes There was a faint indication of the anterior chamber The locality of lens and vitreous contained abllndant calcareous deposits in small masses and the choroidal pigment was rery abundant Sections through the point of entrance of the optic nerve showed no trace of the retina or normal nervous elements at this point Both eyes were similar in the appearance just mentioned A s has been stated the optic nerves were small Right optic nerve area of crosssection near chiasms I00 sq mm Left       338   The connective tissue was vastly increased in both nerves but one also saw the characteristic cross sections of asis qcylinders with their medullary sheaths 1he fibres were both282 DONALDSON large and small It is worth noting that these fibres were abundant in the left nerve but much less so in the right although the right was the larger nerve The chiasma was much flattened dorsoventrally The optic tracts were small and flattened Their area was taken about 10 mm behind the chiasma The relations of size were of course reversed at this point and the left tract was the larger Right optic tract near chiasma 313 sq mm Left     469   From these measurements the only conclusion that can be drawn is that a large part of the fibres decussated In the tracts which were not very well hardened the fibres visible ih crosssection of the corresponding optic nerves were also to be found Throughout the nerves and tracts but more abandant in the latter there were numerous droplets or spherical homogeneous masses as a ruJe about 12 M in diameter and staining with fuchsin alld carmine Iying at the periphery of both nerves and tracts these bodies would appear to cor respond with corpora amylacea with some of the descriptions of which however they do not exactly agree Further than the tracts it was not practicable to carry the histological examination of the optic pathway The corpora geniculata e2rterna were too imperfect for description The pulvinar and the anterior pair of the corpora quadrigemina were both slightly less prominent than in the normal brains The corte2r was the ne2rt locality studied and the results there obtained have already been given The first point calling for remark is that the eye in which vision was longest retained ultimately had the smaller bulb and at the same time it was associated with the larger optic nerve and tract The nerve and tract however though larger showed fewer nerve fibres that were clearly marked It should perhaps be noticed in this connection that this smaller bulb had also the smaller right oculomotor nerve in connection with it From these facts it would appear that although in general the right eye was more seriously affected yet some portion of the retiIla remained undamaged for a long timeup to theON THE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN 283 eighth year During this period the optic nerve the tract and the corte2r underwent considerable development so that the subsequent degeneration of the right nerve was accompa nied by far less atrophy than that of the left side On the left side the disturbance in the eyeball was in general less severe and though vision was abolished very early there was left some condition which favored the better preservation of those nerve fibres which did not at an early period undergo degen eration and absorption I had expected to find complete degeneration of both optic nerves such as had been described by Purtscher 80 On the bases of these specimens I should hardly like to enter into the forms of degeneration possible to the optic nerves but if a double set of fibres in the opticthe two sets developing and conductingin opposite directions be accepted then these nerves found intact in this case ulight be con sidered as belonging to that set the centre for which was central and which conducted peripherally v Monakow 81 82 In this instance then the disturbance in the cortex is prob ably to be looked upon much more as due to an 3rrest of growth following the removal of the normal stimuli than to a continuation of the degeneration into the hemispheres III The Auditory Apparatus From the time of her illness to her death there is good evidence that Iaura was entirely deaf A t the same time she had a good sense of direction and of equilibrium and was sensitive to rotation Hall 6 The equilibrium and auditory functions of the eighth nerve are therefore to be separated in this case An examination of the ears was made in 1878 by Dr Clarence J Blake who reported as follows 6  Both esternal ears normal The right e2aternal auditory canal normal in size and contour and the skin lining the passage healthy and showing no marks of previous inflam mationprocesses The right membrana bympani was entirely destroyed with the exception of a narrow rim the remains of the inferior and posterior portions of the membrane from which a thin cicatrical tissue extended inward to the promont orium over the stapes and fenestra rotunda The malleus284 DONALDSON and incus had disappeared The mucous membrane of the tympanic cavity presented a normal appearance with the exception of one spot on the promontorium covered with a thin crust of dried secretion about two millimetres in diameter A band of thin cicatrical tissue also e2rtended across the anterior portion of the tympanic cavity The left e2rternal auditory canal was filled with dark brownish cerumen on removal of which the passage was found to terminate at a depth of two centimetres in a diaphragm of secondary granulationtissue concave very firm and resisting gentle pressure with a probe except at the central or thinner portions where it could be slightly depressed Its outer covering was continuous with the dermoid lining of the canal After death the petrous bones were put in Dr Blakes hands and the report on them made by Dr W S Bryant of Boston is the following The Examination of Laura Bridgeszans Petrous Bones The Right Petrous Bone A deep groove for the superior petrosal sinus is seen The esternal auditory canal is terminated by a concave curtain of fibrous tissue resting on the promontory There is no evidence left of the former position of membrana tympani except at the floor of the canal where there is a slight indica tion of the sulcus tympanicus The tympanic cavity is con siderably constricted by hyperostoses The oval and round windows are ossified across and the promontory is very rough leaving only a small space inferiorly and posteriorly The inferior anterior wall of the tympanum is very thin and there are two pinhole perforations into the carotid canal The Eustachian tube is impervious its tympanic end being closed by bone and just beyond this there is an accu mulation of cheesy matter also enclosed by bone There are no air spaces within the tympanum for all the bone cells are filled with tissue although in the highest part of the petrous bone there is a cell which connects with the tympanum There is no evidence of mastoid cells or antrum I did not see the mastoid process The chorda tympani muscle is very much atrophied and its tendon is attached to cicatricial tissue The stapediusON TEE BRAIN OF L A URA BRIDGMAN 285 was very much atrophied and its canal narrowed The tendon still protrudes from the tubercle Anteriorly and esternally the osseous wall of the aqueduct of Fallopius is wanting No trace of the ossicles could be found The inner ear appears normal Dr E F Sears kindly examined the terminations of the auditory nerve and organ of Corti and found the terminal ganglion cells intact The Left Petross Bone The groove for the superior petrosal sinus is unusually deep A diaphragm of dense fibrous tissue especially thick and firm on the surface and concave outwards forms the end of the conical esternal auditory meatus 8 mm esternal to the base of the styloid process The floor of the osseous meatus is defective esternally and is pierced internally and anteriorly by a foramen 1 mm in diameter in the fissure of Glacier Esternal to the fibrous diaphragm there is a diaphragm formed by hyperostosis of the walls of the canal which ob structs the passasge except near the centre and slightly es ternal to the normal position of the membrana tympani where there is an opening 2 X 4 mm The hyperostosis estends into the tympanum filling the greater part of it but leaving a space esternal to the fenestr and below the promontory also a considerable space in the esternal anterior and superior part of the petrous bone There are no air spaces between the place of closure of the meatus and the pharyngeal end of the osseous Eustachian tube All the bone cells are filled with soft tissue and the osseous Eustachian tube is not seen No remains of the membranas tympani could be found Before I saw the specimen the tympanum had been opened and some of its contents taken out a11 of this was lost except the head and neck of the malleus with the base of the long process all enclosed in fibrous tissue The relations of the fenestra ovalis and the attachment of the tensor tympani muscle had also been destroyed The chorda tympani nerve was found intact The tendon of the stapedius muscle was protruding from its tubercle286 DONALDSON The aqlleduct of Fallopius and its contents are intact The round window is closed by dense fibrous tissue Both the round and oval windows are small less than onehalf of normal size Dr lI F Sears kindly e2ramined the nerves and muscles and found the tensor tympani considerably and the stapedius slightly atrophied IIe also found numerous ganglion cells in the cochlea The original report of Dr Bryant ends here In answer to a further question honvever he states that nothing patholog ical could be definitely made out in either the cochleas or semicircular canals As the original preservation of the specimens had been in Mullers fluid onlzy they were not in the best condition for a fine histological examination As the case stands the inflammation of the middle ear is the occasion of the deafness The authorities on the subject state that absolute deafness does not follow disease of the middle ear alone So that there is something here to be es plained I consider that the cochlea must have been thronvn out of function on both sides since the tuning fork placed on the skull gave no auditory sensations and this to my mind outbalances the negative result of the histological examina tion The auditory nerves were studied only by means of the stumps attached to the medulla the right auditory had an area of 426 sq mm in cross section The left of 317 sq mm Both samples were taken within about 3 mm of their attach ment to the medulla For the method see the article in this same number on  The size of several cranial nerves in man as indicated bytheir crosssection Roughlytheirarea was about two thirds of that of the similar nerves from the brain of a normal male in whom the cranial nerves were all very large There is no reason then to think that in Laura the nerves nvere remarkably small The figure for the area of the larger right nerve is somewhat too high owing to the obliquity of section and some distortion so that they were really more nearly equal than these figures would indicate The connective tissue in the nerve trunks is normal TheON THE BRAIN OF LAU1tA BRIDGMAN 287 nerve fibre shonv well marked sheaths and asis cylinders If degeneration has occurred in these nerves the indications of it have long since disappeared The nerve fibres found would be designated as normal The bundles of larger fibres presumptively connected with the semicircular canals contain particularly well preserved fibres In the medulla both roots and all three nuclei can be clearly identified on both sides The fibres in the medulla stainby Weigerts method and the cells with carmine as well as could be expected from the con dition of the specimen If there is any abnormality it is that the auditory fibres do not take the Weigerts stain particularly well and that the cells of the accessory nucleus in the medulla are few and poorly developed The striae acusticae were well developed and on gross examination when the floor of the fourth ventricle was viewed from above there were visible two bundles on the right side and three on the left which could be counted as belonging to the striaeX while just cephalad to these was a well marked bundle on each side of the middle line corresponding with the structure described as the conducto sonorus Elangstab and supposed to form part of the centripetal pathway for the auditory impulses On comparison with a number of normal specimens the caudal pair of the quadrigemina exhibited no marked pecul iarity They were small but no smaller than in the case of some normals The corpora geniculata interna did not appear small in Laura upon gross examination but this appearance I am inclined to attribute to the failure of the surrounding regions to fully develop thus causing the corp gen int to stand out with unusual clearness The nest point e2ramined in the auditory pathway was the cerebral cortes and the results there found have already been stated I wish to add in this place that in the description of the surface of the brain previously given Iwas not willing to admit any superficial abnormality in the region of the first temporal gyrus at its caudal end Since writingthat description I have made further comparisons with normal brains and have ob tained evidence of lack of development in the cortes of this288 DONALDSON region in the case of IJaura At present then I look on the slenderness of this gyrus especially on the right side where the cortes is most affected as an expression of the in complete development of the region Mills 42 68 Starr 41 Manouvrier 88 At first sight the small disturbanceto the naked eye at leasl existing between the middle ear and the cortes is striking Eistological investigaJSion up to the centres in the medulla yields a silnilar negative result Between the me dullaJ and cortes the condition of the specimen did not warrant a histological study In the scattered literature relating to the examination of the ear and braln in deafmutesX a condition where there is little or no apparent abnormality of the inner ear the auditory nerve or the medulla associated with disease of the middle ear deafness and sometimes atrophy of the cortical auditory centres is oceasionally described Bremer 69 Larsen i Mygind 70 MOOS n Mygind w Obersteiner 78 Moos and Steinbrugge 74t75t76 I believe that in future cases like that of Laura a more dekailed examination than it was possible to make in her case will show disease of the menlbraneous cochlea or the nerves between it and the spiral ganglion of the cochlea Such a case has been reported by Moos and Stein brugge 79 As long of course as the cells of the spiral ganglion are intact 3ust so long will the auditory fibres associated with them and this must represent a very large portion of the cochlear division of the auditory remain morphologically in tact Following the pathway to thecortes we find no point at which marked changes occur until we reach the cortex it self The disturbance here is most probably due to the early and long continued lack of normal excitation for the cortical cells in the sensory areas are peculiarly dependent for their proper development on the special sense with which they are associated The evidence from stimulation of the cortex and from the histology of the medulla goes to show that the association be tween the auditory nerve and the cortical centre for hearing is to some e2ttent at least a crossed one If this were so thenON THE BB A IN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN 289 the smaller left nerve wollld associate itself with the thinner right cortex This relation exists 1n the case of Laura but it remains for further investigation to show its significance Strumpell 78 A s regards the semicircular canals it may be added that they were not found diseased Their nerve was in good con dition and sensibility to rotation sense of direction etc were present Of course the relation of this part of the inner ear to the middle ear is less intimate than that of the cochlea and this in part may account for the normal preservation of the canals That both portions of the labyrinth need not be conjointly affected is shown by James 79 in his study of the sense of dizziness in deafmutes where this sense was found totally lacking in only 186 out of the 519 cases esamined  IVThe Craniat Nerves It is desirable to bring together the various facts regarding the cranial nerves in Lauras case After what has been said in the foregoing pages and the discussion of their ares by Mr Bolton and myself de P 4 this can be briefly done Table XI gives the various points in a condensed form TABLE XI AREA IN NERVE SQ hh CONDITION SIZE I Olfactory bulb right 634 Somewhat atrophiad Small   tract right 146    II Optic nerve right 500 Greatly atrophied Very small    left 338       tract right 313         left 469     IIt Oculomotor right 317 Normal Larg  i left 351   VIII Auditory

strands were lost and hence do not give the figures for the area The only nerve in the Table which has not been discussed is the olfactory The bulb was flattened and the glomeruli could not be identified The ganglion cell layer was there and contained some well formed cells The other layers were poorly preserved The vessel walls were thickened There was some excess of connective tissue and an abundance of290 DONALDSON hyaline bodies corpora amylacea t Distinctly degener ated fibres could not be made out in the tract but the vessels connective tissue corpora amylacea were found as in the bulb Grossly the left tract and bulbs were like the right but by accident the former was lost before it had been esam ined histologically Whether there was anything peculiar in the glossopharyngeal fibres I am unable to say The portion within the medulla was normal The medulla which was examined from the level of the pyramid to the middle of the pons by means of sections showed no abnormality save in the neighborhood of the acces sory nucleus of the auditory nerve where the cells appeared small reduced in numbers and highly pigmented The pia of the hemispheres had a normal abundance of nu clei in it even over the occipital region and the blood vessels were normal in size and thickness of their walls The cere bellum was also normal V Concluston From these fragmentary observations which leave so many points connected with this special case still undecided it will be advantageous to construct some sort of general picture The anatomical condition was that of a normal brain in which the olfactory bulbs and nerves the optic nerves the auditory nerves and possibly the glossopharyngeal had all been more orless destroyed at their peripheral ends This destruction caused a degenerationmost marked in the optic nerves which estended towards the centres and involved them indirectly This condition has left its mark more or less plainly on the whole hrain as indicated by the estent and thickness of the cerebral cortes and specially by the cortes connected with these deficient sensory nerves The physiological eiiect of the peripheral lesions as I conceive it was to retard growth in the centres cortical and subcortical which were thus involved and also to interfere with if not entirely prevent the formation of the association tracts To be sure this case represents a masimum loss in these de fective senses with a minimum amount of central disturbance thus offering the very best sort of opportunity for education by way of the surviving senses At the same time we mustON THE BRAIN OF LAURA BRIDGMAN 291 imagine the hemispheres to have been traversed in every di rection by partly or completely closed pathways The brain was simpler than that of a normal person and Laura was shut off from those crossreferences between her several senses which tIsually so facilitate the acquisition of informa tion atld the process of thought Mental association was for her linlited to various phases of the dermal sensations and the minor and imperfect senses of taste and smell Yet from their fundamental and protean character the dermal senses are perhaps the only ones on which alone the intellect could have lived We are thus brought back to Sanford7s 7 CO2 clusion as derived from the study of her writings  She was eccentric not defective She lacked certain data of thought but not in a very marked way the power to use what data she had  2 One word more upon the cortes The deficiency in the motor speech centre is mainly macroscopic as far as the third frontal gyrus is concerned The motor centre there whad lost some but not all its associative corlnections Eistologically it was slightly deficient The lesion there was so diiferentfrom that of the sensory centres that a histological diiference ought not perhaps to be surprising The cortes of the sen sory centres was not sunken below the surrounding levelJ thollgh the gyri were slender and flatterled Possibly in this sinking in a motor area and the absence of the saine in the sensory areas we have a suggestive diiierence in the reactions of the several portions of the cortes Finally the deficiency was not so very great even in those areas where it was most marked and the question arises as to what sort of occupation the cells in those areas had which would thus justify their prolonged existence If they were thrown entirely out of function it is not easy to see how they could last so well for nearly sisty years In some way then they may have taken a slight part in the cerebral activity but it was so slight that their specific reactions did nof rise into consciousness for though Laura had some light perception up to her eighth year she apparently had no visual memories whereas those who have retaned full vision up to four and a half or five years of age and then become blind do usually remember in terms of sight 8292 DONALDSON BIBLIOGRAPEY TITLC RSFERENCE NUMBER DATE  54 1840 BAILLARGER

generale Parisz 1885 in his Anthropology p a18 shows the relations between brain weight and age It is based on 1913 cases of Boyd and according to it the maximum encephalic weight for females falls be

weights stands under the head ing i Weight of cerebral hemispheres fresh The question arises whether  cerebral hemisphere  should not be replaced by encephala I have not seen any account of how much of the encephalon was used in determining the fresh weights in this series but since these brains were directly compared with those of other observers in which the entire encephalon had been weighed it is ouly fair to suppose that they had been treated in the same way This was my opinion until I found a table in R Wagners3l Vorstudien 2te Abhandlung 1862 P 91 in which the weights ot the two  hemispheres of at least three of these brains in the table are corupared with one another The specimens had been in alcohol the strengtll of which is not given Now the sum of che weights of the two  hemispheres  is nearly equal to or more than the weight of the brains given by H TVagner 44 1864 I therefore used the word  hemisphere  in the above heading as equivalent to hemi erebrum It would appear that both the Wagners used it as equal to hemiencephalon In the above mentioned table then the weights given are these for the entire encephalon and not for the cerebrum only Page 328 Table I

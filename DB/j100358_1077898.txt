WETZEL Trenton High School Trenton New Jersey The normal curve of distribution is a graphical representation of a series of scientific measurements The distribution of maple leaves according to their width is a familiar illustration The conditions of a scientific curve are that the group be sufficiently large the units not selected and the characteristic capable of scientific measurement A necessary feature of such a curve is a base line graduated on the basis of the unit of measure used This last fact seems to be disregarded at times by educators in the use of this curve What does the normal curve of distribution show  That the same forces applied to the same situation tend to produce the same result Applied to a school system it shows from the teachers point of view to what extent her efforts have been evenly distributed throughout her instructional groups From the pupils point of view it shows the relative position of the pupil with reference to his group From the point of view of neither does the curve in the absence of a unit of measure indicate either quantitatively or qualitatively the character of the work done The assumption is sometimes made by educators that curves which are similar in form are identical in value It is conceivable that the curves showing the relative heights in inches of 10000ooo Filipinos and Ioooo Americans would be similar in form but no one would say that they portrayed identical situations What ever the extremes in height in each group it is a foregone conclusion that the shortest man in the Filipino group would be considerably shorter than the shortest man in the American group Similarly the tallest man in the Filipino group would not be equal in height to the tallest man in the American group Nor if a and a 373374 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May represented two individuals in the same relative position of each of the two groups would any military officer undertake to form a human equation between the two Curves are identical when they occupy the same position not only vertically but also hori zontally with reference to the base line Bearing in mind the difference between similar and identical curves we may make comparisons between any two curves con structed on a common base line with a common unit But in the absence of a common unit of measure the curve of distribution does not furnish a basis of comparison either a between general situations in two groups or b between two individuals in the same relative position in two groups Applied to the work of the classroom this means that in the absence of a common unit of measure the curve of distribution does not furnish a basis of comparison either of the work of one teacher with that of another or of the work of one pupil with the work of another pupil in the same relative position in another group Why this very commonplace statement  Because teachers are asked to make such curves in the absence of a common unit of meas ure to make comparisons of work done by means of these curves and to rate pupils on the basis of such comparisons Teachers are instructed to classify their pupils in any working group as follows to give a rating of E to the lowest group which shall contain a maximum of 12 per cent of the entire group to give a rating of D to the next group which shall contain a maximum of 22 per cent a rating of C to the next group which shall contain a maximum of 50 per cent a rating of B to the next which shall contain a maximum of 22 per cent a rating of A to the highest group which shall contain a maximum of 12 per cent of the entire group All but the lowest group shall pass Such a relative distribution can certainly be made But the question concerns the wisdom of making this relativity the basis of the pupils ratings What is the meaning of the word pass in a system of schools  Is it a relative term only Does it raise the question only of the relative position of a pupil in his own group or of his position relative to pupils in another group X921 THE NORMAL CURVE OF DISTRIBUTION 375 Consider a spelling situation as follows In class A there are 200 pupils No of Pupils No of Words Misspelled 6             97 9

on the basis of a normal curve of distribution and gives a rating of E to the lowest 3 per cent a rating of D to the next 22 per cent a rating of C to the next 50 per cent a rating of B  to the next 22 per cent and a rating of A to the highest 3 per cent A pupil would receive a rating of E on the basis of 97 misspellings if he happened to belong to group A but 90 misspellings would give him E in group B Similarly a range of 80 to 95 misspellings would give him D in the one group while 6o misspellings would give him the same rating in the other group A range of 25 to 75 misspellings would rate him C in one while 50 misspellings would give him the same rating in the other group To receive B in the one he might have from 5 to 20 misspellings while B in the other means 40 mis spellings Two misspellings in the first would rate him A376 THE SCHOOL REVIEW May while he would be allowed five misspellings for the same rating in the second But group A and group B may represent a sixth grade in one part of the city and a sixth grade in another part of the city or a slow and a fast division in any highschool subject Certainly no teacher would justify the relative ratings growing out of such a situation When one remembers that in the average school there can be no scientific gradation of the base line upon which graphs are constructed the uselessness of a normal distri bution curve to determine pupils ratings becomes very evident An illustration of a scientific grouping of individuals would be a curve or a series of curves showing the distribution of pupils taking an intelligence test Even here the significant fact is not the pupils relative position in the group Position in the group is the effect of which the cause is the score upon which that position is based Similarly the proper basis of rating pupils is achievement measured in terms of an objective score Inasmuch as the curve is based on the score the curve loses its significance for the purpose of rating pupils In any community where pupils ratings are determined on the principle of relativity in a group two effects may soon be traced  Curing  retardation becomes a simple process of manipu lating graphs and teachers will be sure to show a low percentage of failures regardless of the quality of the work done The statement that pupils ratings should be given in terms of achievement measured by an objective score in values involves a course of study definitely organized in units having specific aims and provided with objective tests to measure the extent to which these aims have been attained Pass now means moving over a definite path in the course of study Everybody will pass but some will pass faster and farther than others What is the significance of the normal curve in the work of the public schools So far as the schoolforeverybody theory prevails the curve is useful in determining the proper relation between the course of study and standards of attainment Mani festly so far as the community compels attendance in school  everybody has a right to pass at a normal rate of speed But1921 THE NORMAL CURVE OF DISTRIBUTION 377 the rating of any pupil will depend on his score scientifically determined and not on his relative position in a group All of one group may pass a given point in a given time whereas it might be entirely within reason to suppose that none of another group would pass that point in the same time Somewhere after sixteen years of age the  schoolforeverybody theory breaks down Certainly no one would argue that the stand ards in a medical school should be adjusted to the capacity of everybody found among pupils of compulsory school age That is the time comes somewhere in our course of education when standards are determined by conditions external to the group If we grant that this is true in the professional schools we must also grant that it is true in at least part of the work of preparation for admission to these professional schools There can be only one result in the application of the school foreverybody standard to all highschool subjectsthe lowering of scholarship in the high school In the judgment of the writer failure to note the limitations of the schoolforeverybody theory has done much to lower scholarship standards in our high schools and has exerted a noticeable influence on scholarship stand ards in our colleges It seems to the writer that the following conclusions are war ranted by an analysis of the facts i Pupils ratings should be stated in terms of achievement measured by objective standards and not in terms of relative standing in a group 2 So far as the  schoolforeverybody theory prevails the curve of distri bution is significant in working out the proper relation between the course of study and satisfactory standards of achievement 3 The curve has absolutely no value for comparing teachers or pupils except so far as the base line is divided by scientific units objective in character 4 Highschool standards are deter mined partly by conditions external to the group The purpose of this discussion is not to try to prove that all of the work of the teacher is in the realm of science but rather to emphasize the importance of assuming a scientific attitude on the part of the teacher When scientific methods are applied to education we may safely expect the following results I There378 THE SCHOOL REVIEW will be the advantage which always comes from clarity of purpose and definiteness of program 2 The proper basis will have been laid for school organization 3 We shall have effective tools to measure the progress of the pupil 4 The program will be more flexible It will be easier to treat individual differences The danger lies not in promoting a child who is short but in pro moting him and not knowing in what respects he is short 5 Pupils will have a tremendous incentive to work because they can be shown what they must do to be saved 6 Such a program will recognize the fact that much of the finest work of the schools cannot at present be measured and therefore no attempt at rating such work should be made The present method of rating English in our high schools is an illustration of the inconsistencies that grow out of present custom The writer finds it utterly impossible as the principal of a high school to interpret to his son as a pupil or to himself as a father any rating in English which the son may receive The application of the principles advocated in this paper would at once cause a differentiation between spelling development of vocabulary range thought interpretation written composition oral expression and literature There would be a definite course in each department marked off by graded units except probably in literature These gradations would not necessarily coincide with the present division into Freshman Sophomore Junior and Senior English Each pupil would be able to determine for him self just how far he had advanced in the course and each rating could be interpreted in terms of a score obtained in a scientific way

Roger Bacon Commemoration Essays edited by A G Little Oxford 1914 Colonel Hime tries to prove Roger Bacon the inventor of gunpowder by the method employed to prove Francis Bacon the author of Shakesperes playsa cipher Since other contributors to the same volume refer favorably to this effort Mr A G Little p 395 calls it an ingenious explanation and Mr Patterson Muir p 301 says that Colonel Hime establishes a large probability in its favor it may be well to note some points against it quite apart from the merits of the cipher itself In the first place the cipher is based upon chapters of the Epistola de secretis operibus naturae et de nullitate magie not found in the early manuscript of that work and con sidered doubtful by Charles in his work on Roger Bacon Indeed the opening phrases of two chapters  Transactis annis Arabum sex centis et duobus and  Annis Arabum 630 transactis suggest their source Secondly Roger Bacon openly alludes to gunpowder in 1267 in his  Opus Tertium  as already in common use in childrens toy ex plosives Therefore Colonel Hime has to date the De secretis at 1248 and to hold that Bacon was at that time driven to employ cryptic methods by fear of the Inquisition p 334 but that by 1267 circumstances had totally changed in the lapse of years the composition of gunpowder    had been divulged and the first use made of the deadly mixture was for the amusement of chil dren p 321 But is there any good reason for dating the De secretis in 1248 Much of it sounds like a brief popular compilation from Bacons three works of 12678 concocted by some one else later compare for instance the first paragraph of the sixth chapter of the De secretis with Duhem Un fragment inedit de lOpus Tertium pp 1534 and Little Part of the Opus Tertium 5051 The dedication of the De secretis to William Bishop of Paris who died in 1249 occurs first in the late edition of 1618 and has not been found by Little in any manuscript Then the inquisition bugaboo is negligible Has any one ever shown that the inquisition punished a practical invention It was not for having invented the telescope that Galileo was persecuted Moreover Galileos was an exceptional case and it can not be shown that in the thirteenth century the church persecuted men of science Rather popes and prelates were their patrons SCIENCE 799N S VOL XLII No 1092 But even if we admit that Bacon wrote the  De secretis  as we have it in 1248 and was at that time afraid of the Inquisition the ques tion remains why in 12678 when mentioning the explosive in those works in which he made such desperate efforts to secure the pope as his patron and boasted repeatedly of his own superiority to his contemporaries did he not claim the credit of the invention which he had set forth in cipher twenty years before The simple answer is it was not his invention One instance must be added to show how Colonel Hime misinterprets the text of the  De secretis  in his eagerness to smell powder everywhere He writes p 324 Now towards the end of Chap X Bacon speaks without disguise of charcoal under the name of the wood from which it is made and mentions the two trees hazel and willow which give the best He significantly adds that when charcoal is added to proper proportions of cer tain other substances something noteworthy happens Since then charcoal is one of the sub jects of these two chapters it becomes all the more probable that saltpeter forms another In a note Hime adds the Latin of the pas sage in question Si vero partes virgulti coryli aut salicis mul tarum justa rerum serie apte ordinaveris unionem naturalem servabunt et hoc non tradas oblivioni quia valet ad multa Let us note first that these last words do not mean something noteworthy happens but dont forget this because its valuable Thus the true wording does not in the least suggest an explosion as Colonel Himes trans lation does Secondly the words partes virgulti coryli aut salicis probably do not denote char coal but twigs or rods of hazel or willow as they do in Bacons account of the experiment performed by magicians with a split hazel rod It occurs both in the  Opus Maius  Bridges II 219 and Opus Tertium Little 4950 Duhem 153 I quote the latter Unde magici accipiunt virgas coruli et salicum et dividunt eas secundum longitudinem et faciunt eas distare secundum quantitatem palmae et ad dunt carmina sua et coniungunt partes divise sed non propter carmina sed ex naturali pro prietate Wherefore magicians take rods of hazel and willow and divide them lengthwise and hold them the breadth of a palm apart and add their charms and the divided parts come together but not on account of the charms but from their very natures Thirdly it is probably precisely this hazel rod experiment to which the writer of the pas sage quoted by Hime refers Multarum justa rerum serie ordinaveris seems a hurried equiv alent for the more specific directions in the passages in the Opus Maius and Opus Tertium and this bears out what I have already sug gested that the De secretis may be in part at least a brief popular compilation from Bacons other works Finally the phrase unionem naturalem servabunt applies better to the bending together in the middle of two halves of a split hazel rod held apart at the ends than it does to a mixture of saltpeter char coal and sulphur And now what becomes of Colonel Himes assertion Since therefore charcoal is one of the subjects of these two chapters it becomes all the more probable that saltpeter forms an other  We may alter it to read thus since charcoal is not a subject of either of these chapters it becomes all the more improbable that a method of refining saltpeter is dis closed in them in cipher LYNN THORNDIKE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY SCIENTIFIC BOOKS

that a large number of perjured defenses would be eliminated and honest defenses or pleas of guilty substituted which would not only be conducive to good public morals but would save much time and labor in the Courts and would reduce the calendar While the Voluntary Defenders Committee will doubtless minimize cer tain abuses with respect to assigned counsel and may be regarded as a forward step it will not solve the real problem Accused persons presumed to be innocent are entitled to be properly defended Philanthropythough well intentionedis not a substitute for a fundamental right The state should shield those who need its protection That duty should not devolve upon private citizens or be dependent upon voluntary subscriptions Justice not charity is the urgent need MAYER C GOLDMAN New

counsel for needy defendants in criminal cases in New York 1 PurposeTo employ a staff of attorneys and investigators who will offer their services to the criminal courts in cases where the law provides for the assignment of counsel to the defendant who will undertake the voluntary defense of needy and deserving persons accused of crime and who will assist others engaged in like efforts 2 The FieldIn theory the law provides for the defense of every man accused of crime If when he comes up to plead to an indictment he has no lawyer and desires one the court is required to assign counsel to defend him without pay except in cases where the charge is murder in the first degree If he pleads guilty a probation officer is delegated to ascertain facts which will assist the court in determining the proper punishment So far as the statutes are concerned the poor man and the rich are equal in the eyes of the law In practice the theory does inot work out The law can provide for the assignment of counsel but can not provide counsel to be assigned The pro bation officer may do his best but he is an investigator not an advocate The prisoner having admitted his guilt overawed perhaps and disheartened as often as not foreign born and speaking no English can seldom adequately present his own cause to an officer of the law He needs some one to urge it for him In the daily grind of cases through the criminal courts it is seldom that the poor man gets a thoroughgoing defense 3 Why the Courts Find it 14ard to Assign Competent CounselMost lawyers in civil practice have neither the experience nor the equipment to handle properly a criminal case There is required both knowledge of the types of human nature involved and judgment as what the criminal courts and juries will do as to whether for example it is best to defend to plead guilty and trust to mercy or to go to the district attorney present the defendants case and ask for his discharge The essential facts both as to the crime charged and the life and surroundings of the man accused have to be dug out with great difficultyoften from most unpleasant soil This requires trained investigators who know the town and the underworld Few lawyers have such assistants at their command few are willing or able themselves to rummage the unpleasant places for facts and witnesses Not only because he is very loath to undertake the task but because he cannot properly cope with it the civil lawyer is practically exempt from such assignment Practitioners at the criminal bar of the type that a court likes to trust are unfortunately few in proportion to the number of cases to be assigned In 1915 in New York County counsel were assigned to 1495 persons charged with felony The defense of a criminal is a laborious and expensive task Naturally the courts hesitate to impose too much voluntary service on the few VOLUNTARY DEFENDERS COMMITTEE 278

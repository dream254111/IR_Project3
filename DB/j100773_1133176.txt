famiglia a tempo indeterminato a subject chosen by Ferri for the Scuola dapplicazione guiridicocriminali of Rome on the indeterminate sentence is applied to an article by Rodolfo Antonelli of that school in the JulyAugust number of II Progresso del Diritto Criminale Als might be ex pected from the school of the author and the name of the chooser of the sub ject the article is marked by most positivistic tendencies The Scuola positiva and Sociologia criminali are the most often cited authorities The essay takes up the question of the indeterminate sentence from a positivistic standpoint and finds it in every way to be recommended He lauds it in its individual family and social phases and states that it best fulfills the curative function of punish ment from the juridical moral and economic standpoints Under the two later phases the author deals with prisonfarms and prison labor both of which he believes to be necessary reforms He further believes in an absolutely inde terminate sentence that is in the abolition of the minimum and maximum Without a translation it would be impossible to take up his reasons and the details of his plan His last section however in the short span of a review may well be given in full Substitute for the vagueness of moral responsibility the natural responsi bility of the physicopsychic constitution of the delinquent for the concept of punishment that of cure Enlarge the scope of social responsibility for prevention cure and possible extirpation of the disease of crime by the system of indeterminate sentence Give the prisoner in place of useless days spent in solitary confinement with its hypothetical cure through introspection the open air sun and toil Apply to those whom the ancient Romans called furiosi segregational and curative methods Give the family more direct means of communication with the prisoner by means of frequent letters less censored by the prison authoritiesletters of the greatest importance for psychology which are of great weight in avoiding the pests of prison life prostitution and adultery Give the prison authorities a right to act as a pardon board Make every prisoner work according to his age and physical power Have medical specialists Let the prisoners work support him and his family and repair the damage of his crime 926LYNCHINGS DURING 1913 Make provision for the exconvict Such means will afford sufficient protection for the individual his family and society under a system of absolutely indeterminate sentenceat least in the present economic condition of society J L Prison Baseball at the Massachusetts ReformatoryPrison baseball has been in vogue in Massachusetts prisons for more than a generation It is encouraging to see those upon whom the law has placed its seal of degradation enjoy themselves in the pursuit of our national pastime Here we have no um pire baiting We have an ideal baseball game without any unnecessary kicking and fighting The umpire is a prisoner and so are the scorers and all the players And playing is really first class when we consider the lack of practice due to confinement The base running is somewhat below the average of a good team in the outside world The battery work I consider good the out fielding is all that can be desired and the only radical defect in the playing is a little weak infield playing The scoring of the games would do credit to Fos ter 0 P Gaylor and other great baseball scribes to whom our national game is a scientific study The applause is hearty from the prison audience Credit for good playing is freely given along with criticism for bonehead plays The players enter heartily into the spirit of the game and in this manner the game is a great help to enforce prison discipline The ball playing is better in reformatories than in state penitentiaries because in the reformatories youth ful offenders are confined The inmates there average in age from 15 to 35 years whereas in the state prisons the inmates are of more mature years and consequently much slower in an athletic way and the ball played by old of fenders is neither as fast nor as good as that delivered by the youthful in mate JOSEPH MATTHEW SULLIVAN Boston Mass STATISTICS Lynchings During 1913In the year that has just passed fiftyone persons all colored save one were put to death by mobs The number of per sons lynched in 1913 was thirteen less than the number sixtyfour for the year 1912 In fact this is the smallest number of lynchings for any one year since a record of lynchings has been kept This is gratifying and indicates the possi bility of a time when throughout the length and breadth of this land of ours no individual will be put to death without due process of law If all the people white and black will work together in a courageous manner I feel quite sure that this time can soon be brought to pass In spite of the small number of lynchings for the year I feel that in sev eral instances innocent persons were put to death At Greenville Ga a black man was lynched for murder A few days later another person confessed to the crime Two apparently innocent colored persons were put to death at Ger mantown Ky The Memphis Commercial Appeal in commenting on this lynch ing said These negroes had furnished no possible motive for the deed At Houston Miss a colored man accused of murder was lynched It was later discovered that the wrong man had been put to death At Spartanburg S C through the bravery of the sheriff a mob was prevented from lynching a 927

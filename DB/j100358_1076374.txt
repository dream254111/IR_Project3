CHARLOTTE J CIPRIANI Chicago Illinois With the insistent demand that is beginning to make itself felt in America for greater efficiency and less waste of time and of effort in educational processes it may perhaps not be too sanguine to hope that the near future will develop the type of school in which the problem of education will be faced in its entirety and the child will be taught the right subjects in the right way and at the right time irrespective of artificial divisions into primary secondary or college work Only thus shall eventually waste be avoided and efficiency increased In this school of the future the problem of the teaching of modern languages will present itself under a very different aspect from the one it has in American schools today It is an established fact that young children possess a faculty for the acquisition of languages which is weakened in adolescence even in those children in whom the study of other languages besides their own has tended to main tain it this faculty may have completely disappeared in adolescents who have never learned any language besides their mothertongue The presentday scheme of education in America takes no account of these wellknown facts and regularly postpones the study of modern languages to an age when the languageacquiring faculty is greatly weakened or even completely atrophied in the majority of pupils and when the gifted minority can learn to master the language only with an undue expenditure of work and a great waste of time While we are waiting for the opportunity to achieve the abso lute best in the teaching of modern languages under improved conditions it may not be without value to try to attain to the best that is possible under existing conditions A desire to work toward this end prompted the experiments of which I now 516PHONETICS AND PHONOGRAPH IN TEACHING FRENCH 517 submit an account to those who like myself are concerned in raising the status of the study of modern languages in our schools I do this in the hope that those who have experimented along the same lines will contribute to the work the benefit of their own experience and that others may perhaps be interested enough to undertake and forward this work of experimentation The problem as it appeared to me when I took charge of the French and German department at Ottawa University in the fall of I905 may be stated something like this What can be done under existing conditions i to present the French language to the students as it really is 2 to utilize in the process of learning to its fullest extent the students mental equipment as their previous academic training has made it 3 to efficiently stimulate and develop all latent languageacquiring ability French is a living language and the student who devotes his time to its study is entitled to its knowledge as such But a living language is primarily a thing of sounds not of signs Moreover in no other language perhaps are morphology and syntax so completely under the sway of phonetical law as is the case in French With some knowledge of French phonetics we can account for all the chief irregularities of inflection by three at the utmost four simple statements which by repetition and continual application become as familiar to the student as the multiplication table and quite as serviceable And if the students are expected to bring to the French recitationroom and utilize there the best training they receive for example in their sciencework it is imperative to allow them to keep the attitude of mind that in sciencework is most fruitful of results This implies presenting to the students the essential truths concerning the French language not mere expedient superficialities rules of thumb framed prin cipally to relieve teachers and students from the distasteful task of thinking It is not only necessary to present these truths to the students but it is also necessary gradually to train them to ob serve and verify these truths for themselves The peculiar relation between spoken and written French is such that the rules that apply to written French do not state the truth about spoken French the student who has carefully learned the rule that the feminineTHE SCHOOL REVIEW of certain words is formed by adding silent e to the masculine can certainly not observe and verify the truth of this rule when left utterly unprepared for the discrepancy he hears in speech verte and heureuse used as the feminines of vert and heureux The inevitable result is confusion but in sane education to confuse is a crime And we may add How many crimes oh grammar are committed in thy name Consequently it seems inevitable to present the French language first as a thing of sounds It might be objected here that the situation could be met exactly by resorting if not to the socalled natural method at least to some one of the different varieties of the reformmethod which is giving a good account of itself in German schools But the conditions that make the reform method successful in German schools do not obtain here chief among these being the relative importance and time assgned to classroom work and to preparation and the careful training of German pupils in learning by word of mouth and in indefinitely retaining what they have thus learned In America the burden of learning in high school and college is borne by the preparation period not by the classroom period as is the case in Germany highschool pupils have on the whole lost the happy faculty of learning by word of mouth and the great majority consider it a hardship to be held responsible for anything but the days assign ment It stands to reason that it is futile to expect in schools good and lasting results from methods that presuppose for their success certain conditions so long as these conditions themselves are not realizable Under existing conditions the problem then is to leave the burden of learning as much as possible where the general American system of instruction has placed it in the time allotted to prepara tion and still during this time bring the student into contact with the living spoken language not merely with the dead letter Fortunately the progress of science and the genius of an Edison have made this very thing possible the phonograph seems exactly invented to fill the need The phonograph however to remain a valuable instrument de travail and not to degenerate into a mere plaything has to be judiciously and systematically used The 518PHONETICS AND PHONOGRAPH IN TEACHING FRENCH 519 mere juxtaposition of an American preparatory or college class with a phonograph or phonographs can be expected to result in some profitable entertainment but it does not left to itself give promise of resulting in serious work Even the desired phonographs were not at hand when the ele mentary French class at Ottawa University began its work in the fall of I905 nor at first blush did the environment look promising for any enterprising innovations The average preparation of the students for the work was not of the best since no modern language had been begun until the last year of the threeyear preparatory course or the Freshman year in college Moreover the students were allowed to carry exceedingly heavy schedules and were over burdened with student activities lectures and church and other entertainments which they were urged to attend To this must be added the fact that the great majority of the students were working to help themselves through school a condition of things apt to enlist the sympathy of an instructor but not conducive to good preparation It proved no uncommon thing at the beginning of the year for a third of the class to come to the recitation unpre pared and what was infinitely worse much of the work that was apparently done was really worthless because it was not honest Widespread as the evil of cheating seemed it really proved to be but skindeep and yielded to an earnest appeal to the honesty and commonsense of the students With the problem of dishonesty there also disappeared from the department any trace of what might be termed a problem of discipline and the spirit certainly proved to be all that the most exacting teacher could desire The books placed into the hands of the class were Whitneys Introductory French Reader and Larousses Lexicographie cours moyen but no books at all were used for the first weeks the black board and the students notebooks being the chief reliance The first lessons consisted of a few minutes of the ordinary object lesson conversation Voici un livre un crayon etc Questce que ceci  etc intended just as an entering wedge to show that French could really be spoken The real work of the class consisted of a rapid and simplified survey of the elements of phonetics and a study of French sounds Being particularly familiar with theTHE SCHOOL REVIEW work of Mr Paul Passy I took as a basis of this survey Les sons du franqais with occasional reference to other standard works such as Vietors Elemente der Phonetik always striving to keep in mind that every statement given to the class was a means to an end not an end in itself and that anything that would not be of practical service in the work of the year had to be eliminated The vowelsounds were presented on the board in a slightly modified form of the customary triangle When the class could give with sufficient certainty the required sound either when the number was named or the position of the sound pointed out on the diagram I explained to them the great utility of a phonetical alphabet one sign for one sound and one sound for one sign and told them that while French was not written so ordinarily we should begin to write it so using the symbols of the International Phonetical Association The symbols for the oral vowels were then placed beside the numbers With later classes I have found it a help to use colored chalk exclusively for the phonetical symbols during the first year This avoids any possible confusion between soundrepresentation and traditional spelling Then the nasal vowels were taken up but on a triangle of their own By letting the students first give the oral vowelsound then nasalize it the production of nasal sounds was mastered with an ease and correctness I had never been able to obtain with classes who had to struggle against the obsession of the sight of conven tional spelling At this stage of advancement which can be reached with some classes in the third week the work with the phonograph can be begun with great profit I actually did that the following year with a beginning class whose work cannot however be quoted as typical on account of its small size No phonographs being available for the French class in I905 we had to do the best we could with the phonetical script After all the French sounds and their symbols had been gone over began the formal study of the writing of French No grammar in common use in this country brings out the important fact that a careful consideration of French spellings practically covers the field of French inflection and furnishes a most excellent foundation for the rational study of all inflected words This mode of pro 520PHONETICS AND PHONOGRAPH IN TEACHING FRENCH 521 cedure not only relieves the tedium of mechanical memorizing of grammatical rules it also seems to quicken the students interest in language in general even in those boys whose greatest interest lies in other directions If there is a reason for things in French is there not one also in English  This curiosity could of course not always be satisfied but it certainly enhanced the value of the work to have awakened it While it was necessary to present this work to the class in a perfectly  digested form stripped of all unnecessary technicalities I used as the basis for the consideration of the  spellings of French sounds Vietors Elemente der Phonetik and generally for the rela tion of written to spoken French and the reason why of such relation Nyrops Grammaire historique de la langue franqaise Darmstetters Cours historique de la langue franqaise and Le seizieme siecle en France Cle6dats Grammaire raisonnee de la langue franqaise Koschwitz Neufranzosische Formenlehre nach ihrem Lautstande and Didots Observations sur lorthographe As soon as the study of the spelling of vowelsounds had been finished we began to use the reader Part of the first story had indeed already been given the class in phonetical script The sight of written French reacted immediately unfavorably on the pronunciation the nasal vowels being perhaps the worst sufferers Experience with later classes has taught me that the longer the reading of French can be delayed the better results can be obtained with the pronunciation Even a third of the first year might not be too much time to devote to the thorough establishment of a good pronunciation The order of procedure in the readinglesson was the following I read and translated the advancelesson myself till the students were able to translate alone without loss of time Any student was allowed to get the mere translation of the text from any other student if he failed to get it in class as long as he felt he needed this help After the irregular verbs had been firnished few students in the class were willing to admit that they found translation hard and the assignment of a translationlesson for the first day after vacations or when something was going on was esteemed a treat The usual assignment consisted of turning aTHE SCHOOL REVIEW part of the assigned text into phonetical script which in class was placed on the board by the students read corrected and com mented upon and of learning the whole assigned text so that French questions based upon it could be answered in French In this latter part of the work the girls in the class invariably outshone the boys whose inferiority seemed to me to be caused by selfconsciousness rather than by lack of ability Their interest in the work was encouraging however especially when they proved it by declaring themselves willing to contribute their share toward paying for the phonographs if I could make arrangements for their use These arrangements were successfully made and the modest outfit was installed soon after Christmas It consisted of two small machines a larger one on which records could be made two sets of records the advanced course of the International School of Lan guages a number of blank records and the necessary attachments so that several students could use the same machine at one time The whole expense was sixtysix dollars and a few cents Next to the recitationroom there was happily a long narrow room previously used as an office This we converted ambitiously into the laboratory of the French department One table for the large phonograph two small ones for the small phonographs placed as far apart as possible an old bookcase for the records a bottle of gasoline experience proved kerosene to be better a bowl and a roll of cotton to wash the records and the equipment was complete The work could begin A schedule was made out which assigned to every student a twentyminute practiceperiod five times a week though only four of these periods were obligatory The work of the class now consisted of grammar twice a week the exercises in Larousse supplemented by the students notebooks reading twice a week  phonographrecitation once a week The first record we used contained some fables by La Fontaine La cigale et la fourmi Le corbeau et le renard etc The first difficulty was to get the students to run the phonographs with ease the second to get them to work profitably with them The ideal way would be to assign not more than two students to a phonograph at one 522PHONETICS AND PHONOGRAPH IN TEACHING FRENCH 523 time and supervise the practiceperiods just as is done for labora tory periods in sciencework Two students work together very profitably sometimes while some students do not get much good from their practice unless they are working alone We had to assign four and even five students to one phonograph for the same period and it was very rarely possible for me to be present during their practice In spite of the fact that the students enjoyed absolute and unre strained liberty the work proceeded in an orderly manner and phonographs and records were carefully handled Beyond the accidental breaking of one record no damages occurred to the end of the year and this is certainly noteworthy considering that over forty students came and went in the laboratory at will When the first difficulties in handling the phonographs had been overcome and the students had learned first to listen and then to repeat with the records no inconsiderable achievement since it involves the difficulty of the French stressgroup different points were taken up for special attention The placing and ten sion of sounds the voicing of final consonants length of vowels or perhaps linking or accent might be the object of special attention for the week The same special attention might be given again to the same point on a new record or the individual student might be paying special attention to some point in dependently of the class Sometimes the phonographrecitation consisted merely of a supervised practiceperiod during which I sat down at the phonograph with the different groups by turns or with individual students and worked with them correcting and suggesting as the case might be When a complete record or a definite part of a record had been duly practiced and memorized the students were allowed to test their progress by making a record themselves For this purpose the students were divided into groups and a portion of the text to be recorded was assigned each member of the group who when his turn came spoke it into the tube When the record had been made we listened to it and commented upon it and instructed by its shortcomings the group withdrew to work some more and do better at their next turn while another group took their place Sometimes the same groupTHE SCHOOL REVIEW made the record three or four times during one hour and the im provement between the first and last record was often very striking Each group was also expected to place on the board in the adjoining recitationroom the phonetical transcription of the recorded text just exactly as they had heard it irrespective of rules for pronunciation This exercise sometimes gave rise to very fruitful discussions The variant of any group of students or individual student who insisted that that was what they had heard was left to stand unless the authors after discussion and careful listening were ready to admit that their first observation had been erroneous Experience soon taught to avoid fruitless discussion for example concerning length of vowels and even quality of e and osounds in unstressed syllables etc Some of the students became sensitive to fine points of pronunciation whose existence is scarcely suspected by students who learn French chiefly from books Good records were generally kept awhile poor ones were washed just as soon as they had been sufficiently criticized The criticism of a record has a very different effect however from the correction of pronunciation in class its impersonality seems to take all the sting out of it The selfconsciousness and even bashfulness of the boys which had interfered with their progress in the school room disappeared altogether in the laboratory The boy who in class would have been too illatease to repeat with profit the same sentence three times in French would cheerfully repeat it for me a dozen times if necessary in the laboratory I obtained the best results indeed toward the end of the year and the next year when I arranged to make records with only three or four students at one time With supervised practiceperiods this would be an easy thing to do The phonographs had not been in use three weeks before their effect became apparent in the classroom The improvement both in understanding my questions and answering them was very marked The facility of understanding was extended to unpre pared texts short unseen stories like Le cheval vole were readily understood easily repeated and reproduced in writing by the class 524PHONETICS AND PHONOGRAPH IN TEACHING FRENCH 525 The responsiveness of the students proved so encouraging that in the spring I made a bolder venture I made a record of a few short easy stories taken from books to which the students could not possibly have had access I picked out a select group of students two boys and one girl and asked them to work out the record and bring the stories to me in writing It was the first time they had been asked to listen without having at the same time anything to look at and the records given them were far from being so good as those they were accustomed to use With the slightest possible help which consisted in my pronouncing distinctly a few passages which gave them trouble the students made out the stories and wrote them out This type of work does demand on the part of the student earnestness patience and a certain maturity and undoubtedly other members of the class would not have been able to do it at all Those who did do it however considered it exceedingly profitable Just this elasticity this possibility of taking individuality into account and without working a hardship on the lessgifted mem bers of the class providing for the needs of the abovetheaverage student who is so completely slighted in the usual plan of work would certainly prove a most valuable feature if this method of work were further perfected for these few experiments tried under all kinds of material difficulties are far from having exhausted its possibilities The laboratorymethod of studying modern languages has already found eager advocates and phonographs have already become part of the equipment of many schools even with other purposes besides the study of language But their use has not yet become so common and familiar that these practical suggestions as to the way they can be handled in connection with classroom work may not save time and trouble for those desirous of trying them and perhaps even furnish the decisive momentum for their introduction into some French classrooms Aside from actual results which will certainly not fail if the experience of other instructors at all resembles mine the very responsiveness and appreciation of the students will well repay all the time and trouble expended

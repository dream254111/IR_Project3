AParis 1675 in 12 T H E Royal Parisian Academy resolving to search into the Qualities of the most considerable Mineral waters of France did not it seemsproceed to this proceed to this examen without great deliberati on the reasons of the Usefulness of these waters for the recovery of the Health of many sick persons being balanced by those of the difficulty of knowing the Causes of the proprieties of the said waters depending particularly upon the mixtures of certain bo dies they meet with in their passages through the Earthand in the cavities or interstices of Rocks and which are divers and very numerous such as VaporsJuycesSaltsEarthsc They were aware that the greatest part of those matters with which Mineral waters may be impregnated are not discernd in themand that the different mixture which is made of many of them together may constitute so many kinds of Mineral waterssalubri ous or perniciousthat it seems impossible to know them all and to determine them The Waters of the same Springs maysay theyat different times receive notable alterations by new mixtures or by the cessation of those that were made before They think it not likely that the Waters called Mineral are produced of the sole Mineral Vapors condensed and that in the Earth there are Mines in that abundance as  to furnish Vapors capablewhen condensedto entertain and feed the perpe tual course of those waters in Springs that dry not up But they Judge that some Mineral Vapors or Exhalations mix themselves with the Common waters that traverse the Earth where they are and are condensedand that these waters remain impregnated with their qualitiesand with some volatil Salts not concreted elevated in those dry Exhalationsor in those moist Vapors They find that the discerning of the Qualities of those Exhala tions and Vapors is not easie that the diversity of their matter is very great that the occursion of their mixtures is casual that the conditions of the places where they pass and where they are de tainedare not manifest and that the alterations which they pro duce in the waters into which they insinuate themselvesare not al ways well known They613 They consider also that there is no less difficulty in knowing and discerning the Juyces that may be mingled with the Mineral watersand particularly those that receive no Concretionand that do not communicate to these waters any sensible quality Forthose liquid and totally volatil Juyces do pass away in the distillation with the matter of the waterand do not manifest themselves but by such effects as simple water cannot produce They note further that those Juyces which are called Concrete because they are condensable and resoluble leave sediments that render them visible and palpable after the distillation or evapora tion of the water wherewith they are mixed but that tis difficult to discern the species and proprieties of them if they have not some resemblance with those that are known or if there be many of them together As to Salts and Earthsthey look upon them as the most sensible and the most common matters of those that are mixed in the wa ters of Fountains and Wellsso that there is almost no Earth which is not participant of some Salt dissoluble in the waters that pass through and the current of those waters doth also carry always with it some fine and snbtil Earth But though these are the sub stances that are most manifest in these watersyet they findthat the knowledge of these Salts and Earths mixed in the waters is not al ways so distinct as to enable us to determine the species and to give a certain Judgement of their proprieties They observe further that there are few Concrete Salts that are known to usand that there may be many that have nothing like to Common SaltNitreAllom and Vitriol which are the four most vul gar of the concrete Mineral Salts Those whose disposition to con cretion is not finisht and which are yet embrionated and as twere in their feminality or first Being are less knowable in that state and those that are more formed and already concreted or capable of concretion have not simple and homogeneous sub stances in each species That Salt that is called CommonSalt is observd to have two different portions mixed togetherthe one is condensed and crystal lised by cold and in moisture after the evaporation of a part of the water wherein this Salt hath been dissolvedthe other will not be crystallised nor condensed but by a total evaporation of the rest of the water The portion thats crystallised by cold and in moisture is the most sulphureous and by its sulphureity it will mix614 mixe it self with the sulphureous salt of calcined Tartar resolved in the moist Airor in common water without turbidnes and with out coagulation But that portion of this common salt which is not condensed but by the total evaporation of the water that had dissolved it hath an acidity that instantly coagulates the salt of Tartar resolved and all other fixed Salts that are sulphureous and nitrous The Vitriol which in a moist Air yields an efflorescence upon sulphureous marcasites hath likewise a juicy portioncondensable only by the total evaporation of its aqueous humidityand being of a very acrimonious tasteand of an unctuous consistenceand quick ly resoluble in a moist Air which juicy portion is very different from that which it condenseth first  crystalliseth by cold in the water where this vitriol hath been dissolved These crystals are pure vitriolacidaustereof which much mineral earthprecipitates by the mixture of sulphureous and nitrous salts with which the other portion will mixe it self without turbidness not havinglike the former that acidity upon which the sulphureous salts can work Which is otherwise in common salt of which the first por tion is the most sulphureous and the second the most acid True Nitre is likewise composed of two different saline por tions the one more sulphureous which crystalliseth by coldand in moisture and the other which remains dissolved after this cry stallisation and is not condensed but by a heat strong enough to ex pel all dissolutive humidity is less sulphureousand hath some aci dity which the other hath not The first Beings or Embrions of mineral salts are nothing but vapours or juices not concretedtotally vaporableof which some may be condensed and in part fixed by the action of fire or disin gaged from their matrixes and made capable of concretion by means of the Airwhich is observd in certain NitrousAluminous  Vitriolique salts The sulphureous salt  is found in the lime of certain hard stones burnt in the fire and which is a species of true Nitre had its Seminal Being in those crude stones and in that state of its first Beingit is very different from that which it acquires by the fire which from Cold and Coagulative changes it into Cau stique and Resolutive This cold and coagulative quality of this stony salt in its first Being manifests it self enough in the waters of certain Rockspringswhich are very limpid and cold and breed cold and scirrhous tumors under their throats that ordinarily drink615 drink of them TheSeminal substance of stonySalt is made nitrous sulphureouscaustique and resolutive by the fire which was able to exalt it but not able to produce it in calcining these stones no more than that of burnt shels of Oysters of which also a lime is made which hath not less of sulphureous salt in it This embrio nated salt in limestones is a stony juicewhich may mix it self with the waters that pass between the beds  interstices of those stones in the rocks but which is not easily discerned in waters that are impregnated therewith The Seminal Being of Allum and that of Vitriol must also be in the matters from whence these species of Salts are extracted by the means of water after their calcination in the Fire and their ma ceration in the Air The Fire and Air that have exalted themcould not produce them Neither the seminal substance of Allum in A luminous stones nor that of Vitriol in sulphureous marcasites are in that state manifest to our senses and often they come not to be known in Mineral waters but by some effects and that without certainty because those may be equivocal All these varieties of Mineral salts embrionate formd cry stallin juicysulphureousnon sulphureous of the first and second concretion those of their genuss speciess mixtures properti ons alterations c render difficult and uncertain the judgment concerning the proprieties of the waters that partake of them Again concerning those Subtile Earths which do also mixe themselves in Mineral waters they may also be of different sorts difficult to discern Some of them are found of different colours whitegrayyellowish reddish brownand of different qualities some being dissoluble in distilled Vinegar others indissoluble some fusible others not fusible by the fire where they take seve ral colours some are marly others argillaceous others creta ceous some bolarsome sandysome talkysome limy others there are that are produced by the concretion of certain juices saline or sulphureous others not some are simply mineral others me tallique Most of these sorts not being easie to be discerned sepa rately they will be less so when they are mixt with one another The simple infusions of certain sulphureous mineral Earths may notably alter the waters of Wells and Fountains without having any thing of thoseEarths remaining in their sediments after distil lation in like manner as nothing is seen in certain liquours ren dred vomitif by the sole infusion of Antimony L l l l The616 The hot Mineral waters may contract some alteration from the sulphureous and bituminous matterswhich they meet with in their course for these matters partake of certain subtil salts which those waters may resolve and carry away with them Some Cold or Tepid mineral waters have a sharpish or vinous taste which is not observed in any of those that are considerably hot But this taste is so easie lost upon the least heat and even in the free Air that tis hard to know what it is that produces it It is not only found in waters that are esteemd to be Aluminous and Vitriolate but also in those that are manifestly Nitrous and which abound in Sulphureous Salt opposit to Acids The Causes of the Heat of some Mineral waters are little known There is reason to doubtwhether there be Subterraneous fires ca pable to heat them or whether they have received this heat by the exhalations of some Mineral juyces that are fermentableor in which some effervescence is made by the mixture of other juyces All these difficulties have retarded the publication of these Observations whichit seems this Royal Academy hath been these four Years a making upon the waters that have been sent them from divers Provinces of France and that have undergone their examen as occasion hath servd for it Having premised these particulars to manifest the Difficulty and nicety of this kind of researchthey subjoyn the Method em ployd in this examination which indeed is made with that consi deration that becomes the wisdom and care of that Illustrious Bo dy and is adapted to lead them into a greater knowledg of those watersthan those Authors had that have hitherto written of them and that very often have not judgd of them but by the effects which might be referrd to divers causes Now according to this Examen made upon a great number of waters from different Springs both hot and cold they have parti cularly observd Salts and Earths of divers qualities and in dif ferent quantities The Salts which condensed after distillation or a slow evapo ration of the waters were brought before them are here reduced to two sorts viz The one is the Nitre of the Antients wch they describe to be a sulphureous mineral Salt like to the Alcali of Plants the other the Common Salt considerd in either of its dif ferent portions or according to the commixture of both toge ther Andtis remarkableme thinksthat in none of those waters there617 there appeard any Allum or true Vitriol except the water of Vahls in Dauphine which yielded a salt that had some resemblance to white Vitriol They take notice that they did not much apply themselves to observe the Forms and Figures of each of thoseSalts they met with in their condensations because they found them vary in the same Salts according to the manner and degree of the evaporation of the water wherein they were dissolved for refinement As to the Earths that were found in different quantities in the waters here examind they acknowledg likewise that the parti cular discernment of their speciess was yet less easie than that of the species of Salts Some of those Earths were white some gray some redish and in the evaporation of all those waters their terre strial parts formd themselves diversly some into floting filmes some into flocks some into mucilages others into little clods o thers into small grains of sands others into fine brown powder Againsome dissolved almost wholly in distilled vinegar with some effervescence some dissolved but in part some not at all others only gave to the distilled vinegar a high tincture of hyacinth wch was lost in few daies Again the fire made some of these Earths change colour others not and some of them it calcined and vi trified others These observations of the qualities quantities differences and agreements of the Salts and Earths of so many waters examind by these Philosophers of which a particular History and account is here givenmay be very useful  serviceable to those Physitians that advise the use of them the better to make choice of those which by reason of the mixture of those more sensible mineral matters may sute with their intentions for the restoring of many Patients to their former health For a conclusion of this History they give us some Advertise ments and Corollaries worthy indeed to be taken notice of as 1 That the great quantity of mineral waterswhich Physicians make those to drink to whom they prescribe them for the cure of certain contumacious diseases that will not yield to ordinary re medies gives us occasion to judg that the chief effect which they make us expect from themis the cleansing of the viscera by this in ternal ablution And that this effect is considerable because most of Chronical diseases come from the obstruction of the viscera which this great quantitie of mineral drink may remove Mean Llll 2 time618 timetis to be feardthat few Physicians take pains to search into the parti cular qualities of these waterswhich yet are very differingand considerable enough to induce them to an endeavour to know them well that so they may make a better use of themaccording to the differences of Diseases and the different constitution of the Diseased Now these Mineral waters may have different particular qualities upon this account alsothat some of them come from places less distant from the surface of the Earth others from deeper ones The formertraversing Earths less compact do resolve the Salts they there meet withand charge themselves with some of the subtile terrestrial particles found in them by making them evaporate The later being rarified in the depths of the Earth whence they are elevateddo easily receive the mixtures of Mineral exhalations and vapours which are fre quent in those inner recesses but those mixtures often not being discerned in waters carried away from their Sources neither by the scent nor by the tastecannot be known but by the effects which to refer to their causes is not alwaies so easie nor so certain 2 That the knowledg here given of the Salts and Earths of many Mi neral waters will not fully satisfie the curiosity of those that would like wise be informd of the other causes of the proprieties of those watersfor asmuch as that besides the mixture of the concrete matters found therein there may also be found in them matters not concreted so subtile and vola tilthat there remains nothing in the sedimentsthat may come to be known to differ from the Salts and Earths and which is not found any more in what passes by distillation That sharp and vinous tasteabove mentioned which is lost in the Air and by heatmust have for its subject a spirituous  very volatil matter which were worth the being known Again the heat which some waters have in their Sources and at their issuing out of the Earth may be ascribed to some hot vapours that have mixed themselves with them in their course within the subterrancous depths where the cold of the Air hath no free access And certain particular effects of those wa ters upon divers subjects give occasion to judg that they are not pure and uncompounded And into these things this Royal Assembly are resolved to make further inquiries both for the satisfaction of the Curious and the benefit of the Publick 3 Mean time the Observations of the Salts and Earths of these waters may in their opinion serve both in Physick and in mechanical Arts to make us capable to judg of the agreeableness of some of these waters for certain uses and emploiments The two kinds of Salts to which they have reduced those of the Mineral waters of France may have differences which may divide each of those kinds into many species as they have observd in the Salts that are extracted out of the Ashes of divers Plants which they have noted to be like some to true Nitre o thers to Common Salt and to retain the participation of the specifique pro pricties of their subjects Againsome of the Earths found with the Salts in the sediments of Mineral waters evaporated or distilledmay also have par ticular uses according to their differences Some German Physicians have observd that the white Earth of the Mineral waters of Swalbach is pur gativeSome bottles of it were brought to the Parisian Academy of a vinous and619 and strong taste The Salt of its sediment was nitrous and made Sublimate dissolved in common water to precipitate in a Mother of pearl colouras the Alcalies of Plants do The Earth separated from this sediment was white like Creta but there was not enough to try its purging virtue The true Nitre of the Antients being sulphureous and resembling the Plants of ve getables hath as they have this faculty of moving the  And that white Earthwhich is found with the Nitrous Salts of the Mineral waters may participate of the same quality even as the calx of Salt of Tartar co agulated by the second Salt of Seawater retains some proprieties of its Salt though it be insipid and not dissoluble in water but only in acid li quours as is distilled vinegar which dissolves it with an effervescence which hath likewise been observd in many white Earths of Nitrous Mi neral waters 4 As to the Tastes of these waters transported they could only judg of them by what they found when they received them Those that are at the Springhead may discern them betterespecially those that are sharp and vi nous and whose taste decayes or is lost when they are kept or exposed to the Air They may also better come to know the degrees of their Colorati on by the powder of Gallsby Oakleavesand the like and judg more ex actly of their consistence and weight Which particulars could not be so well observd at such a distance at which great changes may have befaln the waters in several respects 5 Concerning that Vaporous matter of the sharp and vinous Mineral waters that seems to be the first Being of the Mineral sulphur and of the concretions thence resulting There are found Earths impregnated with this acid matterbeing vaporosulphureousof the concretion whereof som times are made sulphureous and vitriolique Minerals And often there is not any Mineral concret made that is known in those Earths where no Mineral sulphur nor Vitriol nor Metal is found This vaporous and indi gested Mineral matter may very well be the principle of Vitriol but in its first state it cant be a vitriolique productionif it be found in Earths where there is as yet no vitriol It is more easy to observe it in its productswhen it hath received some mineral concretion The moist Air penetrating into the Minestones that are insipid but impregnated with a Mineral sulphur which makes it self sufficiently perceived when it is disingagd by fire ma nifests to the sense a sulphureous acidity which was not perceivd in it And of the concret sulphur of those Minestones or Marcasites penetrated by the moist Airthere is formd a vitriolique concretwhich is the product of this Mineral sulphur the principle of which was an acid and very vaporous matter This subtile vaporous acid matter doth not alwaies produce vitriolique concrets it hapning in many soils that for want of necessary dispositions it remains in its first state We have observed in many waters impregnated with this acid vapourthat for all this there was not any true vitriol in itnor any thing that had any resemblance to Allum and that the Salt which remaind in their sediment was such Nitre as is de scribed by the Antientsand which differs as much from Vitriol and Allum as do the Alcalies or sulphureous fixed Salts of Plants The620 The SaltsVitriols and Alumsand other concrets resoluble in watermay be so mingled in the Mineral watersas not to be well perceived there but in their sediments but the sulphurs and Bitums are alwaies obvious to be discerned in the waters wherein they are because they reside in them or swim on them not being capable to be mixed with them as Salts are Of these we have perceived none in the waters that were sent us Those that were very hot in their sources did not appear to us more sulphureous or more bituminous than the otherAnd if you meet with Sulphur or Bitumen in their Basons against the walls of their inclosures or in their mud possi bly there are not such matters inflamed within the Earth that have heated those waters it being more probablethat such waters contract their heat by the mixture of some hot waters they meet with in the deep places where they passand experience proving that no combustible matter takes fire or any considerable time keeps it without Air and thatto extinguish the fire of sulphurs and bitums inflamed there needs no more than to ex clude the Air from them And if any matter as Gunpowder in mines takes fire strong enough not to be chokd under ground it bursts what covers it thereby to be enlarged and to take Air If there be no constant subterraneal Fires the heat of some Mineral wa terswhich continue to be hot in their sources cannot be ascribed to them Tis more likely that in many places of the Earth there are hot vapors the heat of which conservd in deep and close places where the Air hath no access to cool them and where those rarified matters have not room enough to be more rarified and so to become less hot or more dissipated And that such hot vapors are the cause of hot Springs and natural Baths may be confirmed hence1Because these hotMineral waters do not burn the mouth of those that drink of them at the issue of their sources as common water would do heated by fire to the same degree Which seems to proceed from the thinness of the matter that causes this heat in the water And the flame of spirit of wine doth not so strongly burn the hand as a live coal would do 2 Because the heat of Mineral waters works not upon certain tender substances as doth that of common water which is contracted by fire in the same intenseness For whereas the leaves of Sorrel eg are softnd and quickly boyled in common water moderately heated by fire they did not so in the Mineral waters of Nery in the Country of Bourbon which are the hottest in all France but they only changed colour and be came yellowish 3Because the Mineral waters have no greater disposition to boyl upon the firethan common cold waters there being as much time requisite for the one as the other to make them boyl upon the firec Mean time tis not so obvious to know the Qualities of these vapors thus heating the Mineral waters It seems not necessary they should all be Bituminous or Sulphureousthough some be so There are many other sub stances that grow hot without taking fire and the vapors of which mix themselves in hot Mineral waters but the qualities of which are not dis cernd but by the effects which they produce As for the different Effects of the Mineral waters both hot tepid and cold in reference to Health the Parisian Academy left the observations thereof621 thereof to Physicians But as to their Uses in Mechanical Arts they take notice of what some or other of them perform eg in the maceration of Hempin the whitening of Linnen in the tincture of Wool and Silk in the dressing of Leatherin the tempering of Ironin the boyling of Legums in the watering of Plantsin the drinking of Catteland the like Touching the observations of their different Weights and Consistences they intimate that they can be better made at the springheadwhere they have not been alterd in their compositionnor consistence However they describe the particular Instruments by them employed for observations of this nature III COCHLEARIA Curiosa or the Curiosities of

Interpreter of this piece have represented unto us therein the Nature Origine Causes DifferencesSigns and Prognosticks of this Distemper and given us divers considerable Observations on the Means to cure the same when it is but Particular that isfixt to some parts as also on the Natural and Cri tical Motions when it turns to be Universal and hath infected the whole body and likewise on the Means serving to raise the Artificial Crisis of it together with an explication of the true Method of artificially raising the Crises of the Universal Pox That which seems most peculiar to this Book is that the Author pre tends to have established the Cause of the Pox upon Principles wholly newvizthe Mixture and Confusion of the semen of many different persons which at length exert their activities in this heterogeneous fermentation degenerating into such a high malignancy as this Disease carries with it But though the Author renders a New Cause of this Malady yet hath he the testimony of the Medical Faculty of Paris that they have not found any thing in his Method of Curing that is not conformable to ancient re ceived Maxims they judging withalthat the New Observationswhich it doth contain will serve to increase an emulation for the future towards a more diligent search of the truth of things less known

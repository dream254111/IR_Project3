J100587,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16831775,103012,AN EXPLANATION OF THE RULE FOR THE FINDING OF EASTER IN A LETTER FROM THE REVEREND MR J JACKMAN TO DR HANS SLOANE S R S,I206889,2123 III AN EXPLANATION OF THE RULE FOR THE FINDING OF EASTER IN A LETTER FROM THE REVEREND MR J JACK MAN TO DR HANS SLOANE S R S HAVING MET WITH SEVERAL EXPLANATIONS OF THE RULE FOR EASTER IN OUR COMMONPRAYERBOOK AND TWO PUBLISHD AMONG THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY BUT NONE RIGHT AND SUFFICIENT AND HAVING UNDOUBTEDLY COLLECTED THE TRUE SENSE OF THE SAME BY COMPARING THE SAID RULE AND THE TA BLE FOR EASTER IN THE COMMON PRAYERBOOK TOGETHER I HAVE BEEN PERSWADED TO COMMUNICATE IT TO YOU IN ORDER TO BE INSERTED IF YOU THINK FIT IN THE NEXT PHILOSOPHICAL TRANS ACTIONS AS HERE FOLLOWS THE RULE IS THUS WORDED VIZ EASTERDAY IS ALWAYS THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE FIRST FULL MOON WHICH HAPPENS NEXT AFTER THE ONE AND TWENTIETH DAY OF MARCH AND IF THE FULL MOON HAPPENS UPON A SUNDAY EASTERDAY IS THE SUNDAY AFTER FOR THE RIGHT UNDERSTANDING OF WHICH IT IS SUFFICIENT TO OBSERVE 1 THAT THE FULL MOON MEANT IS THE 14TH DAY OF THE MOON ACCORDING TO THE KALENDAR IN THE COMMON PRAYERBOOK WHICH MAY BE CALLD THE CHURCHKALEN DAR COUNTING THAT DAY OF THE MONTH FOR THE FIRST OF THE MOON WHICH HATH THE GOLDEN NUMBER OF THE YEAR COLLATERAL TO IT IN THE FIRST COLUMN OF THE SAID KALENDAR AND 2 THAT THESE WORDS NEXT AFTER MAR 21 ARE MEANT INCLUSIVELY AS IF IT HAD BEEN SAID NEXT AFTER THE COM MENCEMENT OF MAR 21 SO THAT IF THE FULL MOON HAPPENS ON MAR 21 THE SAME MUST B E THE PASCHAL FULL MOON NOW2124 NOW IN ORDER TO PROVE THESE OBSERVATIONS ARE BOTH RIGHT AND SUFFICIENT FOR THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE RULE I SHALL ONLY SUPPOSE WHAT ALL MEN OF SENSE AND CANDOUR WILL AND ALL MAINTAINERS OF RULE MUST ALLOW THAT IF THEY ARE NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT TO RECONCILE THE RULE WITH THE AU THENTICK TABLE TO FIND EASTER FROM WHICH PRACTICE NEVER VARIES THEN ARE THEY RIGHT AND SUFFICIENT WHICH BEING PREMISED 1 I PROVE THAT THE FIRST OBSERVATION IS NECESSARY TO THAT END BECAUSE IF THE PASCAL FULL MOON BE ANY DAY BEFORE OR AFTER THE 14TH OF THE MOON BY THE CHURCHKALENDAR THEN THE RULE AND THE TABLE WILL CLASH FOR 1 IF IT BE ANY DAY BEFORE THEN AS OFTEN AS THE SAID 14TH OF THE PASCHAL MOON IS A SUNDAY THAT VERY DAY AT LATEST MUST BE EASTERDAY BY THE RULE AS BEING A SUNDAY AFTER THE FULL MOON THEREIN MEANT WHEREAS BY THE TABLE AND PRACTICE IT IS NOT TILL THE SUNDAY AFTER THAT THUS SUNDAY APR 1 THIS YEAR 1705 WAS THE 14TH DAY OF THE MOON BY THE CHURCHKA LENDAR AND THEREFORE MUST HAVE BEEN EASTERDAY OR AFTER BY THE RULE IF THE FULL MOON THEREIN MEANT HAD BEEN ANY DAY BEFORE THE SAID 14TH OF THE MOON WHEREAS EASTERDAY WAS APRIL 8 BY THE TABLE AND ACCORDINGLY OBSERVD AND THIS OBLIGES US NOT TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE FULL MOON BY THE FULL MOON IN THE RULE BECAUSE THAT HAPPENS ABOUT FOUR DAYS BE FORE THE 14TH OF THE MOON BY THE CHURCHKALENDAR  IF THE FULL MOON MEANT IN THE RULE BE ANY DAY AFTER THE 14TH OF THE PASCHAL MOON BY THE CHURCHKALENDAR THEN AS OF TEN AS THE SAID 14TH HAPPENS TO BE SATURDAY AND CONSEQUENT LY THE FULL MOON MEANT IN THE RULE TO BE THE SUNDAY FOL LOWING AT SOONEST THAT BEING THE VERY NEXT DAY THAT SUNDAY CANNOT BE EASTERDAY BY THE RULE WHEREAS BY THE TABLE AND PRACTICE IT IS THUS SATURDAY APRIL 4 1702 WAS THE 14TH DAY OF THE MOON BY THE CHURCHKHALENDAR AND THEREFORE IF THE FULL MOON MEANT IN THE RULE WERE ANY DAY AFTER THAT IT MUST HAVE BEEN ON SUNDAY APRIL 5 AT  CONSEQUENTLY INFERREDAPRILINFERRED 12 AT SOONEST MUST HAVE BEEN EASTERDAY BY2125 BY THE RULE WHEREAS APRIL 5 WAS EASTERDAY BY THE TABLE AND PRACTICK AND THIS EVINCES THE MISTAKE OF THOSE WHO MAKE THE 15TH DAY OF THE MOON TO BE THE FULL IN THE SENSE OF THE RULE AS DR WALLIS PHILOS TRANS 240 MR WRIGHT IN HIS POSTSCRIPT TO HIS SHORT VIEW OF MR WHISTONS CHRONOLOGY C AND THE INTRODUCTIO AD CHRONOLOGIAM REPRINTED AT OX FORD A D 1704 P 37 2 I PROVE THE SECOND OBSERVATION NECESSARY TO THE SAME END BECAUSE A FULL MOON IN THE SENSE OF THE RULE VIZ THE 14TH DAY OF A MOON BY THE CHURCHKALENDAR OFTEN HAPPENS ON MARCH 21 AND IN THAT CASE THE SUNDAY FOLLOWING IS ALWAYS EASTER DAY BY THE TABLE AND PRACTICE WHEREAS IT MUST BE A MONTH AFTER BY THE RULE UNLESS WE UNDERSTAND THESE WORDS NEXT AFTER MARCH 21 AS I EXPLAIN THEM AND THIS WILL BE THE CASE NEXT YEAR 1706 NOR DOTH THE PROOF OF THIS POINT NEED THE SUPPOSITION OF THE FOREGOING THO THAT MAY NOW BE FAIRLY SUPPOSED AS BEING ALREADY PROVD FORCOUNT YOU THE FULL MOON HOW YOU WILL MARCH 22 CAN NEVER BE EASTERDAY BY THE RULE UNLESS MARCH 21 MAY BE THE PASCHAL FULL MOON BY THE SAME AND YET MARCH 22 IS EASTERDAY BY THE TABLE AND PRACTICE AS OFTEN AS THE GOLDEN NUMBER IS 16 AND THE DOMINICAL LETTER D I AM AWARE THAT THIS 2D OBSERVATION MAY SEEM TO MANY FORCD AND UNNATURAL AND THAT PERHAPS MIGHT INDUCE SOME TO COUNT THE 15TH DAY OF THE MOON FOR THE FULL IN THE RULE AND MR THORNTON PHILOS TRANS 297 TO SUBSTITUTE MARCH 20 IN LEAPYEARS FOR MARCH 21 NEITHER OF WHICH HYPOTHESES HOWEVER DO ANY SERVICE ALL THINGS CONSIDERD THE FOR MER INDEED WOULD VACATE MY SECOND OBSERVATIONMARCH 21 NEVER BEING THE 15TH DAY OF THE MOON BY THE CHURCHKA LENDAR BUT THEN IT WOULD MAKE THE RULE NOTORIOUSLY IRRE CONCILABLE WITH THE TABLE AND PRACTICE AS HATH BEEN ALREADY SEEN AND AS TO MR THORNTONS HYPOTHESIS 1 THE ONLY COLOUR FOR IT VIZ THAT AT THE TIME OF THE COUNCIL OF NICE THE VERNAL EQUINOX WAS MARCH 20 IN LEAPYEARS AND NOT MARCH 21 AS IN COMMON YEARS IS FOR ANY THING THAT I KNOW MORE LIKELY TO BE FALSE THAN TRUE AND DOTH BY NO B B B B B B B B B B B B B MEANS2126 MEANS FOLLOW FROM THE INTERCALATION 2 IF THIS COLOUR WERE TRUE IT WERE TOO GREAT A NICETY TO HAVE BEEN PROBABLY REGARDED BY THE CHURCH 3 THIS HYPOTHESIS PUTS MORE FORCE UPON THE WORDS OF THE RULE THAN MINE AND LASTLY IF IT WERE ADMITTEDIT WOULD SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY ONLY IN LEAP YEARS AND MY SECOND OBSERVATION WOULD STILL REMAIN NE  BECAUSE THE CASE HAPPENS AS WELL IN COMMON AS IN LEAPYEARS WHEREOF WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE IN THE NEXT YEAR 1706 NOR WILL MY SECOND OBSERVATION BE MUCH BOG GLED AT BY THOSE THAT KNOW AND CONSIDER THE INCLUSIVE WAY OF RECKONING USED BY THE ROMANS AND FROM THEM DERIVD TO ALL THE LATIN CHURCHES AND PARTICULARLY THAT OF ENGLAND  TIS AS PROPER TO SAY NEXT AFTER MARCH 21 WITH THE MEANING I CONTEND FOR AS TO SAY TERTIO ANTE CALENDAS NONAS VEL IDUS IN THE SENSE OF THE ROMAN KALENDAR OR AS TO SAY AS OUR CHURCH DOTH A LITTLE AFTER THIS RULE FOR EASTER THAT ASCENSIONDAY IS FORTY DAYS AFTER EASTER INTENDING EASTER DAY ITSELF TO BE ONE OF THOSE FORTY AND TIS OBSERVABLE IN THIS VERY RULE THAT AFTER IT HAD BEEN SAID THAT EASTER DAY IS ALWAYS THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE FULL MOON C TIS ADDED THAT IF THE FULL MOON HAPPENS ON A SUNDAY EASTERDAY IS THE SUNDAY AFTER WHICH HAD BEEN A GROSS TAUTOLOGY IF BY THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE FULL MOON MIGHT NOT BE UNDERSTOOD THE DAY OF THE FULL MOON ITSELF WHEN HAPPENING TO BESUNDAYAND IF THE SUNDAY OF THE FULL MOON MAY BE SIGNIFIED BY THE FIRST SUNDAY AFTER THE FULL MOON THEN THE FULL MOON OF MARCH 21 MAY BE SIGNIFIED BY THE FULL MOON NEXT AFTER MARCH 21 3 I PROVE THAT MY TWO OBSERVATIONS ARE SUFFICIENT TO RECON CILE THE RULE AND THE TABLE BECAUSE I MY SELF HAVE DRAWN UP A TABLE TO FIND EASTER FOR EVER BY THE RULE UNDERSTOOD ACCORDING TO THOSE OBSERVATIONS AND IN THE PLAIN AND OB VIOUS SENCE IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS AND UPON COMPARING HAVE FOUND IT TO AGREE IN EVERY PARTICULAR WITH THE TABLE FOR THE SAME PURPOSE IN THE COMMON PRAYER BOOK AND ANY BODY ELSE MAY MAKE THE SAME TRYAL WHICH METHOD IF OTHERS HAD TAKEN TO EXAMINE THEIR EXPLICATIONS OF THE RULE BYTHEY MUST HAVE DISCOVERED THEIR MISTAKES STONEL EIGHHOUSE OCT 13 1705 III PART

arranged and it is hoped that members at a distance who have hereto fore for various reasons been unable to attend a session of the Club will make a special effort to be present at one or more meetings during the winter With a membership ex tending from Siskiyou to San Diego and east to the Sierras and with but two recognized places of meeting in the State the Club has worked under certain disadvantages which less energetic societies might never have overcome but which may in the future be largely remedied by the chapter arrangement out lined by Mr Daggett in our last issue The business of the Club during the course of the year is transacted in both Divisions by perhaps onethird of the total membership the remaining members being too far removed to take an active part This same minority of the membership supervises the Clubs affairs and directs its destiny while the remaining membership must perforce keep in touch with the Clubs progress solely through the medium of THE CONDOR It is to the credit of these distant members that many excellent sugges tions and papers reach the Club through their energy and direct efforts It is therefore hoped that many of the outside members will make an especial effort to attend at least the Annual Meeting of their Divisions and listen to the reports of the progress made during the year It is apparent that at no distant date the Cooper Ornithological Club will find itself ar ranging for a State Meeting By no other means can the Club as a whole become cog nizant of its strength or comprehend the extent of its membership Out of its active membership of 16o it may safely be assumed that upward of onethird of the members of the Club would attend a general meeting offering a special programme and those fa miliar with the interest taken at the regular meetings can imagine the enthusiasm attend ant upon bringing together 50 or 75 ornitho logistsall from a comparatively small area We daresay that such a session would rival an A O U Congress in point of enthusiasm The Cooper Ornithological Club celebrated its eighth year of existence in June last and the summer of 1903 will mark the tenth anni versary of the Club To the older members it will have been ten years of cooperative orni thological study to the more recent members a shorter enjoyment of the same accruing benefits and to all it will bring the memory of many a pleasant meeting There are those whose names have rightfully found a place on Americas ornithological roll of honor who will recount some of the earlier meetings of the Cooper Club with more feeling than they would perhaps today accord more notable gatherings of ornithologists Wherefore we propose a rousing Cooper Club reunion for 1903 Have we suffered a decadence in popular ornithological writings during the past decade This query sounds a little incongruous in view of the present activity in ornithology for there never was a time when specialists and systematists were as numerous as now and the wave styled  popular ornithology  has swept the Union from shore to shore  yet to the field workers of ten fifteen or twenty years ago there must appear a dirth of that undercurrent of true enthusiasm such as guided their pens to produce some of the most earnest and soulstirring appeals to the hearts of ornithologists that we have known The old Ornithologist  Oologist has not yet ceased to be the rule by which more re cent publishers have measured the merits of their magazines Barring technical work and fads how many latterday bird magazines have approached this splendid ideal  We do not care to venture the answer Where are the pens that turn out such ringing narratives as those of long ago Where are the Hoxies the Taylors the Cahoons the Clarks the Rawsons of the 8os Many of them are still living and doubtless find birdstudy as delight ful as it ever was but their pens have ceased to pass along the cogent thoughts and the en thusiasm which are theirs Ornithology has progressed immeasurably there is need for the great mass of technical work now in progress and the extreme type of popular ornithology is probaly doing some good but between these two is a great and growing class of ornithologists who look to the field and woodland for their inspiration Next to their direct field work they rely uponSep 1901 I THE CONDOR 135 the bird magazines to stimulate their interest by the interchange of thoughts and experi ences And again we ask Have we suffered a decadence in our popular ornithological lit erature  The editors request of contributors who may in the future send in lists for publication that when possible they send them in type written form This reduces the work of editing the manuscript to the minimum and insures the saving of much time in proofreading Scientific names at the best a bugbear to com positors become subject to all sorts of con structions when handed in in the form of hastily prepared manuscript such as results from the tedium of preparing a lengthy list In the past it has usually been found preferable to typewrite lists rather than turn in the written copy with the risk of having to make copious alterations in the proof The editors ask that they be spared this work and that the type writer be resorted to by correspondents in the preparation of future lists From remarks made by members at a recent meeting of the Northern Division it is appar ent that the work of bringing into the Club those ornithologists who are not affiliated with any organized movement for the study of birds has but begun There are conscientious and competent workers far removed from the influences of cooperative bird study who have in their note books reliable records which should have long ago been published A num ber of occurrences each a record were men tioned and it rests with the Club members who are possessed of the location of this buried knowledge to become instrumental in bring ing it to light It was also stated that not a single recorded instance of the Snowy Owl in California could be found save for one or two stray notes which are not citable owing to the exclusive use of the vernacular name There have been a number of Snowy Owls taken in the state and it now remains for the collectors to properly record them The new constitution and bylaws of the Club have now been considered by both Divis ions and will be adopted and in effect by Jan uary I and they will be printed and distributed to members The present constitution has been carefully prepared with a view to meeting all requirements incident upon the increased growth of the Club and the provision for forming chapters where a number of mem bers are conveniently grouped will doubtless be taken advantage of by members far re moved from the places of meeting Beginning with 1902 the annual dues of active members will be 2 this action having been taken at the urgent request of various members who desire to see the Club increase its scope of work as will be possible with its increased revenue It is always a matter of felicitation to note improvement in our contemporary magazines In this connection we congratulate Editor Swain of the Journal of the Maine Ornitholog ical Society for the excellent table of contents and appearance of the July number of this journal Notable articles are Notes on the Pileated Woodpecker by C H Morrell being a record of the domestic life of a pair of these biids which frequented a beech grove and Some Prehistoric Cave and Cliff Dwellers and Their Descendants by Ora W Knight de scribing the evolution in nesting sites and manner of nestbuilding of the various swal lows Other interesting notes and articles round out a distinctly valuable issue With the passing of the summer months most of our fieldworkers have returned from their outings and now comes the season of compiling notes and recording such occur rences as may be of particular interest to their coworkers In California much of the state has been covered by Club members and we may therefore look for some good things in the line of collecting experiences Let each mem ber do his share of writing and we shall be surprised at the volume of material produced As heretofore illustrated articles are always desirable especially when the photographs portray birds or some of their characteristics Photographs of mere nests and eggs without detail and of no especial value should be avoided With a State List promised at an early date and with so competent and energetic an ornith ologist as Mr Grinnell in charge it becomes the duty of every Club member to go through his notes and sift out all records which are likely to be of value and to assist in mapping the distribution of each species with which he is familiar The September number of American Or nilhology contains an interesting article on the California Condor together with some of the best photographs of its nests and nestingsites which have yet appeared The zeal which Mr Reed is displaying is certain to draw to his magazine many valuable bird photographs With the November issue of THE CONDOR will be published a complete list of active Club members It is desirable that the ad dresses of members be brought down to date and to this end we request the attention of each member to the matter Dr R W Shufeldt announces to his friends his removal from Washington to 502 West 142nd street New York City N Y

WEST VIRGINIA T HE Eleventh Amendment to the Federal Constitution post poned for over a century the settlement of the question whether a state of the United States can be coerced to pay a money judgment rendered against it in the Supreme Court of the United States This it did by postponing the rendition of money judgments against a state In 1793 it will be remembered Chis holm v Georgia had held that the provisions of Article III of the Constitution extending the federal judicial power to controver sies    between a state and citizens of another state and giving the Supreme Court original jurisdiction in all cases in which a state shall be a party authorized the Supreme Court to enter tain an action in assumpsit brought against a state by a citizen of another state The decision evoked such objections that the Eleventh Amendment speedily followed2 The amendment by its terms excluded from judicial cognizance only those suits against a state brought by citizens of another state Nothing was said about suits brought against a state by one of its own citizens But the federal jurisdiction based on the character of the parties did not include such suits The only ground on which they might be entertained would be that the nature of the controversy gave rise to federal jurisdiction independently of the character of the par ties Strangely enough it was not until I890 that the Supreme Court was called upon to pass judgment on such an assertion of jurisdic tion Hans v Louisiana3 decided in that year held that the spirit 1 2 Dall 419 I793 2That decision was made in the case of Chisholm v Georgia 2 Dall 419 and created such a shock of surprise throughout the country that at the first meeting of Congress thereafter the eleventh amendment to the Constitution was almost unanimously proposed and was in due course adopted by the legislatures of the states Mr Justice Bradley in Hans v Louisiana 134 U S i iI I89o 3 a34 U S I I890MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW of the Eleventh Amendment and the general principles of public law forbade a suit against a state by one of its own citizens even though a federal question was involved There is abundant evidence that if the states had remained sub ject to suit by individuals it would long ago have been settled whether a money judgment against a state could be enforced Be fore Chisholm v Georgia4 the Supreme Court had threatened the state of New York with judgment by default if it did not appear and show cause to the contrary in a suit brought by one Ostwald The second case to come before the Supreme Court was Vanstop herst v Maryland6 and bills in equity against a state appear in two cases7 after Chisholm v Georgia8 and before Hollingsworth v Vir ginia9 in which it was held that the Eleventh Amendment deprived the court of jurisdiction over suits pending before its enactment The fledgling states as is well known were in the financial pre dicament of Mr Micawber and an important something that turned up to relieve them of embarrassing engagements was the Eleventh Amendment that shielded them from the toils of the law10 In later times too various states have had occasion to seek the protection of the same shield In view of the fact that it is now Virginia who through counsel is expressing righteous indignation in charges of repudiation hurled against another state made from her rib it is interesting to note that Virginia has not infrequently adduced the Eleventh Amendment in resisting the fulfillment of her obligations Louisiana2 GeorgiaI3 and North Carolina4 are also to be numbered among the states that have sought to evade or postpone the payment of their debts by pleading the Eleventh Amendment Wherever shelter has been found for state funds or 4 Supra note I Ostwald v New York 2 Dall 414 1793 This

is a part of our history that at the adoption of the Constitution all the states were greatly indebted and the apprehension that these debts might be prosecuted in the Federal courts formed a very serious objection to that instrument Suits were instituted and the court maintained its jurisdiction The alarm was general and to quiet the apprehensions that were so extensively entertained this

B R Co 109 U S 446 i883 2COERCING A STATE the lack of them the reason has been that the state was not sub ject to suit and that the suits in question were substantially if not formally suits against the state Manifestly therefore the deci sions and the doctrines of these cases have no bearing upon the question whether a state when it is subject to suit can be made to pay if judgment is rendered against it I It is this latter issue which Virginia and West Virginia have been contesting since Virginia obtained a judgment against West Vir ginia for what the Supreme Court determined to be West Virginias equitable share of the debt of the Commonwealth of Virginia exist ing at the time when certain counties seceded and formed them selves into the new state of West Virginia With proceedings an terior to that judgment we are no longer concerned except as cer tain of the provisions of the West Virginia constitution which fur nished grounds for her liability may also be regarded as indicating the duty of her legislature to find a way of paying the sum adjudged to be due The judgment is now of record15 It was rendered in a controversy between states to which the Constitution explicitly extends federal judicial jurisdiction Virginia is now seeking to secure its payment in mandamus proceedings against the members of the West Virginia legislature Whatever may be the difficulties in forcing them to take action to raise funds to pay the obliga tion they do not include any objections that a suit against mem bers of the West Virginia legislature is a suit against a state Such a contention may be fully conceded It is however entirely irrele vant for it is pertinent only when the state itself is not subject to suit which is not the case in suits brought by one state against an other We may then dismiss from consideration the cases in which the Supreme Court has declined to coerce a state through action against its officers In like fashion we may set to one side the actual ad judications in which the Supreme Court has coerced municipali ties through action against their officers6 These cases have it is true an element in common with the issue under consideration They are cases in which the municipality was subject to suit and judgment But the theory on which municipal officers were coerced 14 Christian v Atlantic  N C R Co 133 U S 233 1890 18 Virginia v West Virginia 238 U S 202 I915 1Supervisors v United States 4 Wall 435 1867 Von Hoffman v Quincy 4 Wall 535 1867 Riggs v Johnson 6 Wall i66 i868 Labette County Commissioners v Moulton 112 U S 217 1884 34 MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW by mandamus to exercise the municipal taxing power at the be hest of judgment creditors was that under the existing law of the state they were under a ministerial duty to do the act commanded by the court The state itself was not coerced by compelling mu nicipal officials to do what the legislature of the state had made it their duty to do In positing the existence of this duty imposed by the legislature the Supreme Court has often disregarded later state statutes in favor of earlier ones finding the attempted alteration or repeal of the prior law invalid as an impairment of the obligation of contracts It has overridden the desires of the state as embod ied in the latest expression of its legislature But this is but an or dinary instance of declaring a state statute not the law of the state because it was beyond the power of the legislature With the in valid statute thrown into the discard in accordance with elemen tary notions of constitutional law and procedure there remained only the prior state statute expressly or impliedly commanding the municipal officers to do the very things which the court directed In enforcing compliance with this state law the court did some thing quite different from compelling the state to make a law And it is the making of a law which is sought to be coerced by the man damus proceedings brought by Virginia against the members of the West Virginia legislature Equally inapposite to the present controversy between Virginia and West Virginia are the cases in which the Supreme Court has held that the judiciary cannot levy a tax17 or collect a tax already levied18 Virginia does not ask the Supreme Court to levy a tax in West Virginia It asks the court to order the West Virginia leg islature to do so in default of making other provision for the dis charge of the judgment debt It desires the court to compel a leg islature to raise the money as it has often compelled municipal off icers This desire is in no way discountenanced by cases which hold that it is not the function of a court or its officers to do the actual work of tax gathering Thus we may approach the problem whether the legislature of a state may be compelled to raise the funds to pay a judgment in favor of another state quite unembarrassed by decisions declining to co erce state officials or to levy or collect a tax through officers of the court or by decisions compelling municipal officers to levy or col lect a tax In the opinions in these several groups of cases there are expressions which abstracted from their context lend aid to I Rees v City of Watertown I9 Wall 107 i873 Meriweather v Garrett o02 U S 472 I88o 18 Thompson v Allen County II5 U S 550 i885COERCING A STATE the contentions now of Virginia now of West Virginia in the pres ent controversy In the absence of direct authority on the issue before the court it is not unnatural that both parties should rely on the judicial declarations which seem on their face to support their respective positions Manifestly however such expressions ut tered withoutthought of the particular issue with which the court now has to deal cannot be of controlling or of very great impor tance in solving the instant problem No such light dismissal however can be made of some of the declarations of Mr Justice BREWER in South Dakota v North Caro lina That was a bill brought by one state against another to com pel payment of some bonds issued by the latter and acquired by the former through assignment and in default of payment to fore close the interest of the defendant state in some railroad stock ac quired by the state in return for its bonds and pledged as security for their payment The issue before the court was whether the controversy in question was in substance one between states The minority consisting of Mr Justice now Chief Justice WHITE who wrote the dissenting opinion and Chief Justice FULLER and Jus tices MCKENNA and DAY thought that it subverted the purpose of the Eleventh Amendment to regard transactions between a state and private individuals or corporations as capable of giving rise to a controversy between states The majority however took the posi tion that since the plaintiff state was the real party in interest the litigation was a controversy between states notwithstanding the na ture of the original transaction out of which it arose The statements of Mr Justice BREWER of which notice must be taken were made in the course of discussing the contention that the court had no jurisdiction to entertain a demand for a money judgment against a state for the reason that it had no power to compel the payment of such a judgment Mr Justice BREWER ob served that the premise if granted did not lead to the conclusion but in discussing the pros and contras of the premise he referred to the absolute inability of a court to compel a levy of taxes by a legislature20 Earlier he had said that a levy of taxes is not with in the scope of the judicial power except as it commands an inferior municipality to execute the power granted by the legislature21 These observations were made with direct reference to the pos sibility of compelling a state to pay a money judgment They are however put forward arguendo only and no conclusion is drawn 19 192 U S 286 1904 M 192 U S 286 321 2 I92 U S 286 319 SMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW from them They are not explicitly referred to any precedents for support But a quotation from Rees v Watertown22 indicates that Mr Justice BREWER had that case in mind when he confined the power of the court with respect to a levy of taxes to commands is sued to an inferior municipality The quotation is to the effect that this court has not the power to direct a tax to be levied for the payment of these judgments23 But it is evident that the state ment in its original context means only that the court will not di rect the marshal to subject the private property of individuals to the payment of the debt of the municipality as it was asked to do by the complainant in the case For the decision is that the com plainant can have no remedy in equity since his remedy at law by writ of mandamus to compel the municipal officers to exercise its taxing power must be deemed adequate even though it turns out to be practically fruitless Three such writs of mandamus had al ready been granted and the court calls it the regular remedy in a case like the present24 The case which Mr Justice BREWER appears to have had in mind therefore decided merely that a chancellor would not order a marshal to act as assessor and collector It did not distinguish between coercing municipal officials and coercing members of the state legislature but between coercing municipal officials and substi tuting for them a marshal Yet Mr Justice BREWER infers from it or from some other source the absolute inability of a court to compel a levy of taxes by the legislature If he assumed that he was merely repeating wellestablished law his dictum may be dis missed as unfounded But if it was an expression of his opin ion of what the law ought to be it cannot be rejected because di rected to some other issue than that involved in the controversy between Virginia and West Virginia For it was uttered with ex plicit reference to the question whether the legislature of a state which was a judgment debtor to another state could be compelled to exercise its legislative powers to raise money to pay the judg ment However unsupported by previous authority it is a clear dictum in favor of West Virginias motion to discharge the rule in mandamus Aside from this dictum however there is no authority on the issue raised by the states now contending We have therefore one of the not infrequent instances in which a court must make some new law It must declare for the first time either that a state can 22 9i Wall 107 i873 23 9 Wall o07 ii6 quoted in 192 U S 286 319 19 Wall I07 I24 6COERCING A STATE not be coerced to pay a judgment rendered against it or that it can In making this new law the court will undoubtedly be influ enced by old law on analogous situations But in so far as it ex ercises a choice in rejecting or accepting competing analogies pressed upon it in finding the previous situations too remote from or sufficiently close to the situation now before it it is making up its own mind on the significance of the points of difference and resemblance between the past and the present And on the prob lem of what weight to attach to those points of difference or re semblance separately and collectively the previous authorities are not precedents They decide the questions then in issue not other questions confessedly different How different the new question is and what difference the difference makes are new questions with every new question Though the Supreme Court is now called upon to solve a prob lem hitherto unsolved customary technique places the new wine in old bottles The decision is apt to be brought within some fa miliar aphoristic formulation which men and lawyers are wont to call a general principle And counsel for Virginia and for West Virginia bring forward formulations and annexed corollaries on which they respectively rely West Virginia resists the motion for the mandamus by assert ing that the writ has never been granted to compel the exercise of a discretionary act and that it rests with the discretion of the West Virginia legislature to determine to what use it shall put its distinct ly legislative powers of taxation The use of this discretionary power has not been granted to any federal authority and is therefore one of the powers reserved to West Virginia by the Tenth Amendment It is conceded that jurisdiction to render judgment includes juris diction to issue proper process to collect the judgment It would be proper process to issue an execution against any property of a pri vate nature which West Virginia might chance to own But the fact that she happens to be execution proof does not authorize the issue of an essentially improper process such as mandamus to com pel the performance of a function not ministerial Failure to com pel satisfaction of a judgment because the only proper process does not bring desired results involves no substitution of judicial in competence for judicial power as Virginia contends because judicial power means power according to the forms of law and that means according to the usages and principles of jurisdiction as fixed by the history of our jurisprudence25 Mandamus if 25 Reply Brief of Defendants page 6 7MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW granted might be unavailing in case the legislators either resigned or refused to obey as has happened in the case of municipal offi cials And if in compliance with a writ the legislature voted to levy a tax no member would be acting as a legislator26 He would not be a lawmaker for the law would have been already made by the court which ordered his action and thus had usurped the powers of the state in violation of the Tenth Amendment Virginias opposing contentions may be summarized as follows The duty of West Virginia to pay the judgment is established by the rendition thereof in a cause in which the Supreme Court had jurisdiction The jurisdiction of a court to render judgment nec essarily includes power to coerce the payment thereof A state with no reserved power to resist the rendition of a judgment has no re served power to resist ancilliary proceedings to compel its satis faction The duty of the West Virginia legislature to provide funds to pay the judgment is mandatory and not discretionary The mandamus proceedings do not seek to dictate how the legislature shall raise the funds but leaves it a choice and asks for the levy and collection of a tax only in case other means are not adopted West Virginia has no discretion whether it shall pay or not pay It has only a choice of means of finding the wherewithall to pay It must choose some means Virginia asks the West Virginia legis lature to adopt a particular means only in case it neglects to em ploy any or all of the alternative means and thereby declines to exercise its discretion and fails to perform its mandatory obliga tion to use some means II Such in substance are the positions of the parties as disclosed in their briefs From them we turn to the opinion of the Supreme Court rendered on April 22 Ig1827 This opinion written by the Chief Justice discusses but does not determine the question whether the writ of mandamus will be granted It affirms the duty of West Virginia to pay the judgment and the power of the court to com pel such payment but it leaves open and orders a reargument on the question of ways and means It not only invites West Vir ginia to pay but warns her in unmistakable terms that if necessary she will be coerced to pay In discussing possible ways of exer cising coercion it goes beyond the prayer of Virginia and suggests for argument further expedients which may be adopted in case 26 Ibid page 5 27 Virginia v West Virginia 246 U S 565 i9I8 8COERCING A S TATE technical difficulties prove insuperable to granting the writ of man damus As an indication of what the ultimate result will be the opin ion is dehnltlve Law as iMr Justice HoLMEs reminds us is a proph ecy of what courts will do in fact28 So the opinion of Chief Jus tice VVI1TirE is a prophecy that the Supreme Court in fact will com pel VIest Virginia to pay It therefore declares the law that a state can be coerced to pay a judgment rendered against it in favor of another state But the opinion reserves for the future the deter mination of the method by which this will be accomplished if coer cion continues to be necessary It expresses the hope if not the con viction that such necessity will not continue Its monition and its invitation are both conveyed in the statement that we are fain to believe that if we refrain now from passing on the questions stated we may be spared in the future the necessity of exerting compulsory power against one of the states of the Union to compel it to dis charge a plain duty resting upon it under the Constitution29 The opinion starts with an affirmation of the proposition relied on by Virginia to the effect that judicial power essentially in volves the right to enforce the results of its exercise30 Three cases are cited in support of the principle Wayman v Southard31 and Bank of United States v Halstead32 held that the jurisdiction of the federal courts did not end with the rendition of judgment but in cluded the issue of execution in conformity to federal practice un controlled by any statute of a state Gordon v United States33 de cided that the power to grant an execution was an essential part of judicial power and that Congress could not give the Supreme Court an appellate jurisdiction over the Court of Claims where that court was by statute forbidden to issue executions on its judgments None of these three cases touches the question of compelling a state to pay a judgment but the Chief Justice follows their citation with the sentence And that this applies to the exertion of such power in controversies between states as a result of the exercise of the jur isdiction conferred upon this court by the Constitution is therefore 28 The prophecies of what courts will do in fact and nothing more pretentious are what I mean by the law The Path of the Law io Harvard Law Review 457 461 29 246 U S 565 604605 a0 246 U S 565 591 1 ro Wheat i I823 32 io Wheat 51 1823 33 This case was decided in 1864 and an opinion prepared by Chief Justice Taney shortly before his death The opinion was lost and a brief opinion was later rendered by Chief Justice Chase and reported in 2 Wall 56I I865 Later the opinion of Chief Justice Taney was discovered and is printed in the appendix of volume 117 of the official edition of the Supreme Court reports at page 697 9MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW certain4 He regards the point as established by the many cases in which the court has exercised jurisdiction in controversies between states He adds that the fact that in all cases the judgments of the court were voluntarily respected and given effect to cannot be re garded as establishing the contrary unless it can be said that be cause a doctrine has been universally recognized as being beyond dispute and has hence hitherto in every case from the foundation of the government been accepted and applied it has by that fact alone become a fit subject for dispute35 But West Virginia does not dispute the proposition that power to render a judgment against a state includes power to issue pro cess to enforce the judgment It simply insists that the process must be proper process and that mandamus against the members of the legislature is not of that description It concedes that execu tion would be proper process if confined to property owned by the state in a nongovernmental capacity The primary position of the Chief Justice is not conclusive of the question raised by West Vir ginia unless power to render judgment against a state necessarily includes power to take any and all further steps that may be prac tically necessary to enforce the judgment Plainly the Supreme Court avoids going to this extent at present It invites further argu ment on the propriety of any specific procedure Its initial para graph therefore merely refutes a straw contention that the power of the court is exhausted with the rendition of the judgment But this is a contention not advanced by the defendant state The ensuing paragraph of the opinion discusses the bearing of South Dakota v North Carolina36 upon the issues before the court No reference is made to the statement of Mr Justice Brewer which seemingly conceded the absolute inability of a court to compel a levy of taxes by a legislature37 or to any consideration in the opin ion in the Dakota case of the problem of coercing a state to pay a judgment duly rendered against it The Chief Justice refers only to the fact that in the opinion in the Dakota case it was remarked that doubt had been expressed by individual judges as to whether the original jurisdiction conferred on the court by the Constitution embraced the right of one state to recover a judgment in a mere action of debt against another38 This is dismissed by pointing out that the doubt was not solved in the Dakota case since the 84 246 U S 565 59I 5 246 U S 565 592 se Supra note I9 37 Supra page 5 38 246 U S 565 592 IoCOERCING A STATE question was not involved39 and that any question on the point need not now be considered because the power to render the judg ment as between the two states whose enforcement is now under consideration is as to them foreclosed by the fact of its rendition40 Inasmuch as West Virginia no longer contests the power of the court to render the judgment it has rendered the discussion of the question seems surplusage It does not touch the effect or validity of Mr Justice BREWERS dictum in the Dakota case on which West Virginia relies and which if accepted and approved seems to sus tain its contention Equally unnecessary too seems the further reason given for not considering whether the court can entertain an action of debt brought by one state against another This reason is stated as follows And second because while the controversy between the states culminated in a decree for money and that subject was within the issues nevertheless the generating cause of the controversy was the carving out of the dominion of one of the states the area composing the other and the resulting and expressly assumed obligation of the newly created state to pay the just proportion of the preexisting debt an obli gation which as we have seen rested in contract between the two states consented to by Congress and expressed in sub stance as a condition in the Constitution by which the new state was admitted into the Union41 If one were required to venture a surmise for this part of the Chief Justices opinion a clue might be found in the fact that three of the justices who dissented in South Dakota v North Carolina42 are still on the bench It may be that the Chief Justice wished to make it clear that West Virginia could derive no comfort from that fact since he and the other dissentients in the Dakota case sharply differentiated that dispute from the issue between Virginia and 39 The decree in the case ordered North Carolina to pay said amount with costs of suit to the state of South Dakota    and    in default of such payment ordered the sale of the railroad stock owned by North Carolina and pledged for the payment of its bonds But the opinion treated the order to pay the money merely as a foundation for the order of sale Mr Justice Brewer saying There is in this case a mortgage of property and the sale of that property under a foreclosure may satisfy the plaintiffs claim If that should be the result there would be no necessity for a personal judgment against the state  Equity is satisfied by a decree for a foreclosure and sale of the mortgaged property leaving the question of a judgment over for any deficiency to be determined when if ever it arises 192 U S 286 32I 40 246 U S 565 592 41246 U S 565 592593 42 Supra note I9 IIMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW West Virginia Viewed from this angle the comment in the Da kota case though surplusage adds to the force of the plain admoni tion that West Virginia must pay voluntarily or involuntarily That admonition is unmistakably clear in the discussion of the first of the two subjects with which the remainder of the opinion deals This subject is stated as the limitations on the right to enforce inhering in the fact that the judgment is against a state and its enforcement against such governmental being43 And the treat ment of it is introduced by the question May a judgment rendered against a state as a state be enforced against it as such including the right to the extent necessary for so doing of exerting authority over the governmental powers and agencies possessed by the state44 This question goes to the root of West Virginias conten tion in so far as it is based on the Tenth Amendment And the clear and definite answer is given that she acquires no protected position by reason of the fact that she is a state After summarizing the contentions of Virginia45 whose signifi cance and scope are said to be aptly illustrated by the refer ence in the argument to the cases sustaining the power of the courts to enforce the levy of a tax by a municipality the Chief Justice states and analyzes the reply of West Virginia West Virginia in sists that the defendant as a state may not as to its powers of gov ernment reserved to it by the Constitution be controlled or limited by process for the purpose of enforcing the payment of the judg ment46 It argues that the recognition of the power to issue exe cution against state property not used for governmental purposes affords no ground for upholding the power by compelled exercise of the taxing authority of the state to create a fund which may be used when collected for paying the judgment47 The contention that judicial power to adjudicate the controversy between the states does 43 246 U S 565 593 44 246 U S 565 593594 45 On this subject Virginia contends that as the Constitution subjected the state of West Virginia to judicial authority at the suit of the state of Virginia the judgment which was rendered in such a suit binds and operates upon the state of West Virginia that is upon that state in a governmental capacity including all instrumentalities and agencies of state power and indirectly binding the whole body of the citizenship of that state and the property which by the exertion of powers possessed by the state are subject to be reached for the purpose of meeting and discharging the state obligation As then the contention proceeds the Legislature of West Virginia possesses the power to tax and that body and its powers are all operated upon by the judgment the inability to enforce by means of ordinary process of execution gives the right and sanctions the exertion of the authority to enforce the judgment by compelling the Legislature to exercise its power of taxation 246 U S 565 594 4 246 U S 565 594595 47246 U S 565 595 ISCOERCING A STATE not warrant interference with rights reserved by the Constitution is treated as based on the argument that since although the au thority to enforce the adjudication may not be denied execution to give effect to that authority is restrained by the provisions of the Constitution which recognize state governmental power4 This seeming inference that counsel for West Virginia concede that authority to enforce the adjudication may not be denied re quires examination The Chief Justice seems to think that they start with the same premise as do their opponents for he says Mark in words a common premisea judgment against a state and the authority to enforce itis the predicate upon which is rested on the one hand the contention as to a com plete and effective and the assertion on the other of limited and inefficacious power But what may be in words a common premise is not a common pre mise in substance When Virginia thinks of authority to enforce the adjudication she has in mind authority to take whatever steps may be practically necessary to compel its satisfaction Her premise con tains already her conclusion of a complete and effective power In so far as West Virginia on the other hand concedes the existence of authority to enforce the adjudication she means only author itv to take steps towards enforcing it by issuing an execution against nongovernmental property if such there be What may be in words a common premise can be made common in substance only by un warrantably enlarging West Virginias concessory recognition of authority to enforce the judgment in one particular way into author ity to enforce it in some general or universal sense And this con cession is not the premise on which she predicates her contention of a limited and under certain circumstances an inefficacious power Her premise is that a state cannot be coerced to exercise its govern mental powers This premise like that of her opponent is made in the image of the conclusion drawn therefrom Virginia and West Virginia part company not by taking different lanes from a common premise but by selecting at the outset different premises each of which leads unerringly to the desired goal Plainly enough therefore the court must choose between the competing premises which the contending parties respectively urge upon it West Virginias concession that authority to enforce the adjudication may not be denied is limited to a specific method of 48 246 U S 565 595 49 246 U S 565 595 I3IMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW enforcement and the existence of that method is not in logic neces sarily inconsistent with the nonexistence of some other method No action on the part of state authorities is necessary when the court issues an execution against state property This method of enforcing a judgment does not involve the coerced exercise of state powers by state authorities The confession therefore that a state is not immune from one form of coercion does not inexorably force the abandonment of any claim to immunity under the Tenth Amend ment to any other form of coercion Nevertheless the considerations that permit the use of one meth od of compulsion may well furnish sufficient grounds for the refusal to countenance certain objections to other methods of enforcement This does not follow syllogistically but much that is wise and desir able can be securely built on something less mechanical than the syl logism The argument of the Chief Justice amounts to saying that the conception of a state which insists that because it is a state its legislature is immune from compulsion is in common sense incom patible with the conception which concedes that it may be forcibly de prived of its property The court in passing title to state property on an execution is achieving what might be accomplished by the state itself through an exercise of its governmental powers It is substituting the judicial power of the nation for the legislative power of the state It is acting inconsistently with the conception of a state as an independent member of the body of states in the inter national sense It is affirming that a state of the United States is not what we know as a sovereign or completely sovereign state and is thereby laying a sufficient basis for the dismissal of claims to im munities which are based on a premise of sovereigntyo The Chief Justice makes this clear in a later sentence As it is certain that governmental powers reserved to the states by the Constitutiontheir sovereigntywere the effi 50 In a passage which does not make its meaning wholly clear and which the writer may misinterpret the Chief Justice seems to indulge in the paradoxical position that it is the argument of West Virginia rather than that of Virginia that minimizes the reserved powers of the states After saying that the common premise of a judgment against a state and the authority to enforce it is the predicate on which is rested on the one hand the contention as to the existence of complete and effective and the assertion on the other of limited and inefficacious power he continues But it is obvious that the latter referring as the writer interprets it to the contention of West Virginia that the power of the Supreme Court to enforce a judgmen against a state is a limited and inefficacious power can only rest upon either treating the word state as used in the premise as em bracing only a misshapen or dead entity that is a state stripped for the purpose of judicial power of all its governmental authority or if not by destroying or dwarfing the significance of the world state as describing the entity subject to enforcement or both 246 U S 565 595 I4COERCING A STATE cient cause of the general rule by which they were not subject to judicial power that is to be impleaded it must follow that when the Constitution gave original jurisdiction to this court to entertain at the instance of one state a suit against another it must have been intended to modify the general rule that is to bring the states and their governmental authority with in the exceptional judicial power which was created51 He goes on to say that no other rational explanation can be given for the provision And then he adds And the context of the Constitution that is the express prohibition which it contains as to the power of the states to contract with each other except with the consent of Congress the limitations as to war and armies obviously intended to prevent any of the states from resorting to force for the re dress of any grievance real or imaginary all harmonize with and give force to this conception of the operation and effect of the right to exert at the prayer of one state judicial authority over another52 A state of the United States then is stripped of all attributes of sovereignty so far as concerns any claimed immunity from the coercive power of the Supreme Court to compel payment of a judg ment rendered against it in favor of another state Whatever ob jections it may still urge against any particular form of procedure these do not include reliance on any characteristic or quality of its statehood or on any inference therefrom When subject to suit and judgment a state has no more legal or political majesty behind which to shelter itself from coercion than has a municipality West Virginias claims under the Tenth Amendment are based on a premise of sovereignty which the Supreme Court unequivocally rejects These claims of reserved powers or immunities are said to conflict with the claims of all the states to sue and obtain satisfaction and the latter are regarded as superior As the Chief Justice puts it it is difficult to understand upon what ground of reason the preser vation of the rights of all the states can be predicated upon the as sumption that any one state may destroy the rights of any other without any power to redress or cure the resulting grievance53 The conclusions based on analysis and choice of competing prem  246 U S 565 595596 62 246 U S 565 596 6 246 U S 565 596 I5MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ises are fortified by the history of the institutions from which the provisions of the Constitution under review were derived54 His tory of course has the same possibilities of diverse uses as have fig ures The Chief Justice relies mainly on the position that the im potence of Congress under the Articles of Confederation to enforce its adjudications created an evil that cried aloud for cure and that the dangers of the past and the unalterable purpose to prevent their recurrence in the future was the motivating cause of the provisions in the Constitution which combined to unite the authority of the Supreme Court to decide controversies between states with the power to enforce its decisions55 It may be doubted whether the appeal to history adds much to the conclusion of the court reached on independent grounds56 That at any rate is a matter which may now be left to the historians Certain it is that in many respects a state of the United States is shorn of attributes of sovereignty which it possessed before the federal Constitution If it was formerly de batable whether there survived some remnant of sovereignty which saved a state from coercion to pay a judgment rendered against it the debate is now closed by the opinion of the court under review The body duly vested with authority to decide the question has decided it There is no mistaking the implications of the courts utterance In inviting further argument on the question whether mandamus is the appropriate remedy for compelling the state to discharge what was later called a plain duty resting upon it under the Constitution57 the scope of the invitation was significantly limited by the statement that in so far as the duty to award that remedy is disputed merely because authority to enforce a judgment against a state may not affect state power the contention is adverse V4246 U S 565

conclusions of that body being the entire power of the realm whether exerted through the medium of a royal decree or legislation by Parliament 246 U S 565 597 But as Dean Bates points out in the Michigan Law Review volume i6 pages 617621 this is not persuasive for our entire governmental machinery under English rule was totally different from that existing after the Declaration of Independence An editorial writer in the Harvard Law Review volume 31 pages 1158II6I goes further and says that it would not seem unreasonable then to believe that neither the framers of the Constitution nor subsequent judicial expounders considered that the court had this enforcing power over the states in the absence of a direction by Congress The writer infers from the fact that prior to the Constitution the judicial function in con troversies between states had been performed by a court which admittedly had no power to enforce its decrees that no greater power was included in the grant in the Constitution to the Supreme Court The Chief Justice as we have seen infers the opposite 7 246 U S 565 604COERCING A STATE ly disposed of by what we have said58 And that part of the opin ion heretofore under consideration is summed up as follows The state then as a governmental entity having been subjected by the Constitution to the judicial power under the conditions stated and the duty to enforce the judgment by appropriate remedies being certain even though their exertion may operate upon the governmental powers of the State we are brought to consider the second question   59 III This second question is What are the appropriate remedies for such enforcement60 Of its own motion the court asks whether Congress has power to legislate for the enforcement of the obliga tion of West Virginia61 and determines that it has Since the obligation arose from a contract between the states consented to by Congress the power of Congress to refuse or to consent necessarily carries with it the right to ensure the enforcement of the agreement to which its consent was necessary This power is plenary and complete limited of course as we have just said by the general rule that the acts done for its exertion must be relevant and appropriate to the power62 But i is added that the lawful exertion of its authority by Congress    is not circumscribed by the powers re served to the states63 Care is taken also to point out that the exist ence of this power in Congress to legislate is not incompatible with the grant of original jurisdiction to this court to entertain a suit between the states on the same subject64 One is legislative power to create new remedies in addition to those now available under the Judicial Code The judicial power is distinct from this The two grants in no way conflict but cooperate and coordinate to a common end that is the obedience of a state to the Constitution by perform ing the duty which that instrument exacts65 The plain implication of this is that the power of Congress to create new remedies in no way negatives the existence of adequate remedies already available to thecourt by implication from its power to hear and to determine

might do the opinion turns to the topic which it heads the appropriate remedies under existing legislation6 It makes clear that mandamus is not inap propriate because it compels the exercise of governmental authority by a state But it leaves undecided and asks for further argument on the question whether it is inappropriate because precluded by the existence of a discretion in the West Virginia legislature or whether as contended by Virginia the duty to give effect to the judgment against the state operating on all state powers excludes the legis lative discretion asserted and gives the resulting right to compel67 On this question it would seem the court should have little diffi culty It has already been determined that West Virginia is under a duty to pay the judgment and that performance cannot be resisted because it is exacted of a state as a governmental entity There is no dispute that the legislature is the body duly vested with authority to ensure the performance of this duty The duty to make payment is mandatory and not discretionary The only discretion possessed by the legislature is with respect to ways and means by which the mandatory duty to pay shall be performed This discretion is not interfered with by the mandamus For the prayer is that the legislature shall assess and levy a tax upon the property within the State of West Virginia sufficient to provide for the payment of said judgment    unless the Legislature shall    make provision for the payment of said judgment by a duly authorized issue of bonds the proceeds of which shall be sufficient to pay said judgment in full in cash68 The writ if granted in accordance with the prayer leaves open to the legislature the choice between the only two meth ods by which the duty may be performed The argument of West Virginia to the contrary presents no seri ous issue This insists that the legislature under the state constitu tion has a discretion as to the methods both of taxation and of issu ing bonds It may raise a tax all at once or distribute it over a period of years69 If it issues bonds it may do so under section 8 of the constitution of I863 which requires provision for a sinking fund sufficient to pay the accruing interest and redeem the principal within thirtyfour years70 or under section 4 of article Io of the present constitution which provides that the payment of anly liabil ity other than that for the ordinary expenses of the State shall be 246 U S 565 603 67 246 U S 565 604 68 West Virginias Brief in Support of her Motion to Discharge the Rule in Man damus page 20 69 Ibid page 2I 70 Ibid pages I7I8 I8COERCING A STATE equally distributed over a period of at least twenty years71 That here is discretion must be conceded But the mandamus need not interfere with its exercise The writ is satisfied if bonds are issued under either provision and the money raised and paid to Virginia And the court may easily leave to the legislature the choice of raising a sufficient tax in a single year or of distributing it over a period of years The further difficulty suggested by West Virginia that one house of the legislature may choose one method and the other house choose another72 is also superable They are under a duty to agree on some satisfactory expedient They have discretion only as to the choice of the particular expedient on which they shall agree If they fail to agree on any they exhaust their discretion and are left with only the mandatory duty to provide for payment The writ compels them to do a particular thing only in case they fail to exercise the other choices open to them Having chosen not to adopt any of these alternatives they have brought themselves to the position where no choice remains and where the mandatory duty can be per formed in only one way The argument of Virginia on this question of discretion is couched in general terms and is unsupported by authority Its substance is contained in the following three brief paragraphs There is a vast difference between a discretion to do or not do a particular act with no compulsion to do one thing or the other and a discretion to do one of two things with a duty to select Should the Legislature of West Virginia see fit to raise the money by creating a bonded indebtedness and with the pro ceeds paying the debt it may thus save the necessity of a large immediate levy Its primary duty however is to pay the debt and the only discretion conferred upon it is to determine whether it will pay it by exercising one power or another Its duty is to exercise a power which will force payment73 Reliance was also placed on Marshalls statement in Marbury v Madison74 that it is not by the office of the person to whom the writ is directed but the nature of the thing to be done that the propriety or impropriety of issuing a mandamus is to be deter n Ibid page 2I This part of West Virginias argument is given on page 587 of volume 246 of the official edition of the United States Supreme Court Reports 72 246 U S 565 587 73 Virginias Brief in Support of the Petition page 30 19MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW mined75 But any objections which West Virginia might have to the application of this principle to the present controversy are fore closed by the opinion of the court Possibly the courts postponement of a decision on the question whether mandamus is an appropriate remedy is due in part to the desire for a more adequate and complete presentation of Virginias contention It seems more likely however that the chief reason for the postponement is to be found in the statement previously quoted from the opinion that we are fain to believe that if we refrain now from passing upon the questions stated we may be spared in the future the necessity of exerting compulsory power against one of the states of the Union to compel it to discharge a plain duty resting upon it under the Constitution76 This is to say that the court assumes that having made clear to West Virginia that its duty to pay the judgment is obligatory and that it cannot be re sisted by reliance on any objections based on the premise that the governmental powers of a state cannot be coerced no further steps will be necessary It is not to be supposed that once the matter of duty is finally determined a state will seek to evade or avoid its obligation The tone and tenor of the whole opinion of the court indicates that the postponement of compulsion is due rather to mo tives of consideration and respect for West Virginia than to any doubts of the power of the court to exert it Though Virginia does not support her argument by authority the principles on which she relies are elementary As Dillon puts it The general rule is this If the inferior tribunal corporate body or public agent or officer has a discretion and acts and exercises it this discretion cannot be controlled by mandamus But if the inferior tribunal body officers or agents refuse to act in cases where the law requires them to act and the party has no other legal remedy and where in justice there ought to be one a mandamus will lie to set them in motion to com pel action and in proper cases the court will settle the legal principles which should govern but without controlling the discretion of the subordinate jurisdiction body or officer77 In a footnote the learned author after citing many cases proceeds The principle in the text is well illustrated by the case of King v Bristol Dock Co 6 B  C ISI in which the dock 74 Cranch I37 I803 75 Virginias Brief in Support of the Petition pages 2627 76 246 U S 565 604 77 Municipal Corporations 5th ed section 1489 page 2657 20COERCING A STATE company was authorized by Parliament to make a floating harbor in the city and required to make such alterations and amendments in the sewers of said city as might or should be necessary in consequence of the floating of said harbor and it was decided that the directors might by mandamus be com manded in the words of the act to make such alterations etc but the nature of the alterations could not be specified as this was a matter committed by Parliament to the judg ment and discretion of the directors of the company78 Spelling states the same point as follows But the fact that an officer has discretion as to the man ner in which he shall perform an official duty does not jus tify a refusal to act at all Thus it was held that county commissioners would not be controlled by mandamus in the exercise of any discretion as to the character or style of the courthouse or jail they should erect or of the offices they should provide yet the duty of erecting these buildings being imposed by law if these or other officers refused to act a writ of mandamus would issue to compel them to exercise the duties imposed upon them79 Similar illustrations appear in cases where the writ has issued to compel the giving of an examination to determine whether relator is qualified to practice law80 and to compel a Civil Service Board to admit relator to an examination for an appointment to a position in the classified service81 In these cases the court left to the exam ining bodies the exercise of their own judgment as to the qualifica tions of the applicant but it required them to exercise that judgment This is what another court had in mind in saying that courts on suitable occasions will apply the spur of mandamus to put the dis cretion of inferior courts and officers in motion82 The text writers and cases thus support the principle that mran damus may be used to tell officers what they shall do even though they must be left free to determine how they shall do it They can not fail to perform a duty merely because they have a choice as to how they shall perform it The distinction rests on the difference 78 Ibid page 2658 9 Injunctions and Other Extraordinary Remedies 2nd ed volume 2 pages II95 1196 citing State v County Commissioners 22 Fla 29 and Reddick v

between means and ends It may be mandatory to achieve a given end but discretionary to choose between alternative means Ob viously the mandatory duty would fail of enforcement if those charged with its performance were entitled to say that since each particular means rested in discretion when considered separately they all rested in discretion when considered collectively The dis tinction is plain and clearly established even though it easily invites verbal quibbles The only escape from the application of these wellestablished principles to the case at bar lies in the fact that they have previously been applied only to what are commonly called inferior officers The duty in question has usually been imposed by the legislature and officers have been coerced to do only what the legislature made it their duty to do Or as suggested in our discussion of the cases in which municipal officers have been compelled to levy a tax83 the court there did something quite different from compelling the state to make a law whereas what Virginia now asks is that the Supreme Court compel West Virginia to make a law But the difficulty here is chiefly verbal In both cases the levy of the tax is the making of a law Ordinances as well as statutes are laws The difference that the distinction seeks to point out is that the ordinance of the municipality which is coerced is passed in pur suance of a duty imposed by the legislature while in most instances the legislature is itself under no duty to call into play its legislative power But the difference has no bearing on the case in hand in which the legislature is under such a duty This duty arose from the contract between Virginia and West Virginia duly consented to by Congress It was recognized and sanctioned by the constittuion of West Virginia in a provision which the Supreme Court in one of the earlier ctages of the present litigation called an exhortation and command from supreme to subordinate authority to perform the promise as soon as may be and an indication of the way84 So the duty which the legislature of West Virginia is now asked to per form is enjoined upon it by the law of West Virginia as embodied in its constitution The legislature is subject to thelaw of the con stitution as the municipality is subject to the law of the legislature The legislature is in the present situation an inferior authority in the same sense in which the cases and the textwriters have used that term in referring to the persons subject to mandamus The duty is imposed upon it by the superior authority of the state constitution 83 Supra pages 3 and 4 84 Virginia v West Virginia 220 U S I 30 I9II 22COERCING A STATE It is recognized sanctioned and defined by the Supreme Court of the United States With the dismissal of the contention that the state legislature because it is the legislature of a state is not subject to coercion that body is for present purposes placed on the same level as the officers of a municipality and is therefore subject to the canons applied to them in distinguishing between their obligatory and their discretionary functions It seems clear then that the courts denial of the existence of any discretion in the West Virginia legislature as to whether it shall or shall not make provision for paying the judgment and its denial of the existence of any immunity from coercion on account of the in volved interference with legislative and governmental functions of a state foreshadow the exercise of coercion if it shall continue to be necessary The existence of discretion as to the means that the leg islature may adopt to perform its duty will necessarily influence the manner and extent of the coercion to be applied The compulsion will go no further than is necessary to ensure the performance of the duty But that far it will undoubtedly go The only serious question in this respect is whether the court will force the legislature to make provision for immediate payment or will be satisfied if it makes progress in that direction It is open to grave doubt whether the Supreme Court will respect the contention of West Virginia to the effect that the discretion of the legislature to raise the necessary amount by taxation in a single year or to distribute the burden over a number of years is a discre tion that cannot be interfered with The duty to be enforced is the duty to pay now This is not performed by paying in installments Such exercise of the particular discretion adduced by West Virginia necessarily involves recreancy to its fixed and determined duty The court may therefore well hold that this particular discretion is sub merged in the duty The discretion which exists in general does not exist ad hoc This decision will be the easier to reach because of the fact that it will not compel the levy of a tax in a single year sufficient to pay the judgment The state will still have open to it the issue of bonds which is the normal and sensible way of acquir ing funds to meet exceptional obligations Such bonds may be paid from taxes distributed over such a period as the legislature may deem best within the limits set by the state constitution Only for the purpose of embarrassing the judgment creditor without result ing advantage to the debtor state could the legislature of West Vir ginia choose slow taxation to pay the judgment rather than slow taxation to pay bonds issued to provide funds for immediate pay ment of the judgment And any such use of discretion can with 23MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW good reason be brought within the rule that in extraordinary and exceptional instances of gross abuse even discretionary powers are subject to judicial control85 There remains for consideration only the contingency that man damus even if granted might not secure satisfaction to Virginia This is suggested by counsel for West Virginia in their reply brief If such a writ should be proper it would necessarily oper ate upon the individual members of the two Houses of the legislative department of the State and if they should dis obey its mandate however unsatisfactory the reason they might lie in jail for contempt during their terms of office and this would not bring the tax or pay the debt   86 Counsel hasten to add that one could scarcely conceive of such a result and certainly would not anticipate it87 Nevertheless muni cipal officers have acted in this refractory and inconsiderate fash ion88 and the contingency has interesting theoretical if not prac tical aspects It is not unlikely that it is the suggestion of this possibility by counsel for the defendant state that caused the Supreme Court of its own motion to ask for argument on the question whether there is power to direct the levy of a tax adequate to pay the judgment and provide for its enforcement irrespective of state agencies89 and to announce that in case it determined that any of the suggested processes were available it reserved the right to appoint a master for the purpose of examining and reporting concerning the amount and method of taxation essential to be put into effect whether by way of order to the state Legislature or direct action to secure the full execution of the judgment as well as concerning the means otherwise existing in the state of West Virginia if any which by the equitable powers in discharge of the duty to enforce payment may be available for that purpose90 The courts request for argu ment on this question has added interest because of the concession by counsel for Virginia that it may well be that this Court has no power itself to levy a tax9l To this concession is added the state ment that this power rests in the Legislatures of the different 8 Dillon op cit sec 1489 volume 4 page 2656 See also

which this Court has held that of itself and by itself it has no such power of tax assessment93 The cases referred to are the ones in which the court declined to serve as substitute for the taxing authorities of a municipality94 They did not involve attempts to collect money due from a state And the Supreme Court by now setting for argu ment a point conceded by the plaintiff against itself indicates plain ly enough that it is open to conviction that a state against which a money judgment has been entered in favor of a sister state may be subject to methods of coercion not applicable to a municipality Limits of space forbid an extended examination of the cases hold ing that a court will not itself exercise the taxing powers of a muni cipality or county Such an examination is rendered unnecessary by the recent opinion of the Supreme Court in Yost v Dallas Coun ty95 which places the earlier decisions on a ground which cannot avail West Virginia in the instant controversy In view of the fact that this opinion was rendered on January I8 I915 over two years prior to the argument before the Supreme Court on Virginias motion for a mandamus it is a little surprising that counsel for Virginia should have made the broad concession that the Supreme Court could not itself exercise the taxing powers of West Virginia And since the fundamental issues in the VirginiaWest Virginia controversy were decided in I9II96 it is not unnatural to infer that the expressions of the court in the Yost case97 in I915 were uttered with direct reference to the problem of collecting a judgment against a state In the Yost case98 the court was asked to appoint a commissioner to levy collect and pay over a tax to a judgment creditor of a coun ty It declined to do so rejecting the contention that the statutes in existence when the bonds were issued authorized such an exertion of judicial power and therefore brought the case within the prin ciple of Supervisors v Rogers99 But it prefaced its consideration 9 Ibid 8 Ibid Among them are the cases cited supra notes I7 and I8 and infra note o06 95 236 U S 50 x915 For a discussion of this case see a note in 28 Harvard Law Review 617 6

dissented but without opin ion There is no way of knowing whether they based their dissent on a different inter pretation of the state statute or on disapproval of the general doctrine which has re strained the court from collecting taxes through its own officers 25MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW of the question of statutory construction by a discussion quite un necessary to the case in hand but most pertinent to the problem now raised for argument In the words of Mr Justice HOIMES The fundamental consideration for answering these ques tions is that the obligation upon which the judgment was re covered was an obligation under not paramount to the au thority of the state It is true that the district court of the United States had jurisdiction of the suit upon the contract but the extent of the obligations imposed was determined by the statutes of Missouri not by the Constitution of the Uni ted States or any extraneous source the Constitution only requiring that the obligation of the contract should not be impaired by subsequent state law The plaintiff by bringing suit in the United States court acquired no greater rights than were given to him by the local statutes The right so given was to have a tax levied and collected it is true but a tax ordained by and depending on the sovereignty of the state and therefore limited in whatever way the state saw fit to limit it when so to speak it contracted to give the remedy100 This writing on the wall has little need of an interpreter West Virginias obligation to Virginia cannot conceivably come within the description of the obligations incurred by counties and municipali ties It easily comes within the description of the obligations ex cluded from the doctrine of the cases in which the court declines to act as tax gatherer Its extent was determined not by the statutes of the state but by some source extraneous to those statutes It is declared to be an obligation under the Constitution of the United States The right of Virginia was not subject in its inception to limitations imposed by statutes of West Virginia for it arose be fore the West Virginia legislature came into existence as the legis lature of a state The remedies for its enforcement are in no way limited by provisions emanating from the sovereign power of West Virginia at the time the right arose for there were none They are limited if at all only by some inherent weakness in the judicial power of the Supreme Court of the United States And such weakness if it exist is entirely independent of anything in the con stitution or laws of any state Mr Justice HOLMES plainly means to make it clear that the court is now of opinion that it was not from any defect of judicial power 10 236 U S 50 56 26COERCING A STATE 27 that federal courts have refrained from the administrative work of laying and collecting taxes to satisfy judgments rendered by them It was because the judgment creditors before the courts were in no position to ask for such an exercise of judicial power That there are intimations to the contrary in the cases in which the court has refused the requests of judgment creditors it would be futile to deny101 Mr Justice HOLMESI does not seek to deny it On the con trary he seems to be aware of such intimations and to disapprove of them and limit them For he says of the language of his prede cessors that some of it may go farther than was necessary or than we should be prepared to go in a different case102 And his earlier discussion makes it clear enough that the different case which he has in mind is a case against some other governmental entity than a city or county Such a case is one against a state Thus before the writing of the opinion in the present matter in dispute between Virginia and West Virginia the court had nega tived any application of the cases against municipalities to cases against a state in so far as they seemed to stand in the way of the levy and collection of taxes by an officer of the court But this does not necessarily lend support to the venture which the court now asks the contending parties to support and resist by argument Some independent foundation must be laid But where there is a will it is not difficult to find a theoryl03 The Supreme Courts unequiv 1t One of the strongest statements is by Mr Justice Miller in Heine v Board of Levee Commissioners I9 Wall 655 66o66i 1874 There does not appear to be any authority founded on the recognized principles of a court of equity on which this bill can be sustained If sustained at all it must be on the very broad ground that because a plaintiff finds himself unable to collect his debts by proceedings at law it is the duty of a court of equity to devise some mode by which it can be done It is however the experience of every day and of all men that debts are created which are never paid though the creditor has exhausted all the resources of the law It is a misfortune which in the imperfection of human nature often admits of no redress  The power we are here asked to exercise is the very delicate one of taxation This power belongs in this country to the legislative sovereignty state or national  The power must be derived from the Legislature of the State It certainly is not vested as in the exercise of an original jurisdiction in any Federal Court  It is not only not one of the inherent powers of the court to levy and collect taxes but it is an invasion by the judiciary of the Federal Government of the legislative functions of the state government While not all of Mr Justice Millers reasoning is applicable to the present case of West Virginia his statement that it is not one of the inherent powers of a court of equity to levy taxes is broad enough to cover the present issue Nevertheless the Supreme Court might hold that it is not confined to the ordinary powers of a court of equity in acting in a capacity which may be characterized as that of authoritative arbitrator in a quasiinternational controversy 102 236 U S 50 57 1a Compare Peckham J in Bohm v Metropolitan Elevated Ry Co I29 N Y 576 587 I892 Hence when under legislative and municipal authority the railroad structure was built it was supposed by many there was no liability to abutting owners because noMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW ocal assertion of its power and duty to enforce the judgment against West Virginia if enforcement shall be necessary seems sufficient evidence of the will And for the theory it need only go to the dis senting opinion of Mr Justice CLIFFORD in Rees v Watertown104 the leading case in which the court declined to subject the taxable property of a city to the payment of a judgment rendered against it This was as follows I dissent from the opinion of the court in this case upon the ground that equity will never suffer a trust to be defeated by the refusal of a trustee to administer the fund or on ac count of the misconduct of the trustee and also because the effect of the decree in the court below if affirmed by this court will be to give judicial sanction to a fraudulent repudi ation of an honest debt For which reasons as it seems to me the decree of the subordinate court should be reversed105 With Mr Justice CLIFFORD dissented also Mr Justice SWAYNE and their dissent was continued in the later case of Heine v The Board of Levee Commissioners06 Now that the decision of the majority in those cases is regarded as dependent on a defect in the right of the creditor the theory of the minority can be accepted and applied to a case where the plaintiff is not burdened with any such defect It must of course be recognized that this trust theory is a loose one and is applicable to the present situation only by somewhat tenuous analogy But the court throughout the litigation has treated it as something quite different from an ordinary lawsuit In an opinion rendered in I9IO it said The case is to be considered in the untechnical spirit prop er for dealing with a quasiinternational controversy remem bering that there is no municipal code governing the matter and that this court may be called upon to adjust differences that cannot be dealt with by Congress or disposed of by the legislature of either state alone07 land of theirs was taken and any damage they sustained was indirect only and damnum absque injuria When the courts acquired possession of the question and it was seen that abutting land which before the erection of the road was worth for instance 0oooo might be reduced to a half or a quarter of that sum in value or even rendered practically worthless by reason of the building of the road it became necessary to ascertain if there were not some principle of law which could be resorted to in order to render those who wrought the damage liable for their work It has now been decided that  By this mode of reasoning the difficulty    was overcome Italics are writers 104 I9 Wall 107 I874 10 I9 Wall I07 125 106 I9 Wall 655 I874 a10 Virginia v West Virginia 220 U S I 27 28COERCING A STATE In this spirit the court has allowed West Virginia latitude and delay that would hardly have been accorded to an individual defendant And by the same token it may be expected when it has finally deter mined the matter of right and duty to avail itself of commonlaw analogies that reach the substance even though they may be less close in respect to form But aside from Mr Justice CLIFFORDfS trust theory there is other support for collecting a judgment against a public corporation by judicial levy on the taxable property within its borders A refer ence to this appears in Supervisors v Rogers108 in which the Su preme Court sanctioned the judgment of the circuit court below in ordering that the marshal be appointed a commissioner to levy a tax in satisfaction of a judgment against a county The decision was based on the fact that a statute of the state in existence when the debt was created provided that where the defendant refuses to perform a duty enjoined by mandamus the court may direct that the required act be done by the plaintiff or by some other person ap pointed by the court It was held that this practice prescribed for the state courts could be adopted by the federal court in the par ticular case even though not adopted prior to the bringing of the suit In referring to the requirement of the statute Mr Justice NELSON said This section is but a modification of the law of England and of the New England States which provides for the exe cution of a judgment recovered against a county city or town against the private property of any individual inhabi tant giving him the right to claim contribution from the rest of the peoplel09 The doctrine is stated by DILLON as follows In the New England States judgments against municipali ties are not enforced by mandamus but in a mode peculiar to those States By the common law of the New England States derived from immemorial usage the estate of any in habitant of a county town terirtorial parish or school dis trict is liable to be taken on execution on a judgment against the corporationll 108 7 Wall 175 1869 1097 Wall I75 I8x 10 Op cit sec I5o6

REVIEW This is not the common law of many of the jurisdictions which compose the United States But the reasons which have induced its creation or acceptance by some of the states may easily be suffi cient to secure its adoption by the Supreme Court of the United States in a situation where other precedents are held not apposite and where some capsule of theory is desired to carry the medicine of substantial remedial justice The court could hardly have asked for argument on a form of remedy which the moving party refrained from urging and even disclaimed unless it had been somewhat predisposed to consider it favorably Such a predisposition has no obstacle to encounter in the precedents for the situation is novel and precedents against it are therefore lacking The levy of a tax through officers of the court can without stretch of logic or of sense be rested on the de clared principle of the authority and the duty of the court to com pel the payment of the judgment especially if it should appear that such a levy is the only remaining mode of compelling that payment When to this is added the direct support of the commonlaw prac tice obtaining in some of the states with perhaps the additional flying buttress of the theory that the taxing power is held in trust and that the court can appoint a substitute for a recusant trustee it can readily be appreciated that all that stands in the way of the Supreme Courts appointment of a tax gatherer to subject West Virginia property to the payment of West Virginias debts is the lack of will to do so IV That the Supreme Court is reluctant to impose coercion upon West Virginia in any form is apparent But that this reluctance as some have thought is due in any degree to a doubt as to the duty or authority to impose that coercion if it shall ultimately be necessary is with great difficulty to be believed As unbiased a reading of the courts latest utterance as one aloof from the inter ests of the contending parties can give leads only to the inference that the reluctance is due wholly to the belief as expressed by the Chief Justice that if we refrain now from passing on the questions stated we may be spared in the future the necessity of exerting compulsory power against one of the states of the Union to dis 111See the note in 3I Harvard Law Review 1I581I6I In criticism of the treatment of the problem contained

duty to enforce it viewed in that aspect Chief Justice White in 246 U S 565 605 and therefore makes use of premises which the court in its opinion discountenances 30COERCING A STATE charge a plain duty resting upon it under the Constitutionl2 This inference is fortified by the later insistence that the judgment against the state operating upon it in all its governmental powers and the duty to enforce it viewed in that aspect are things which are irrevocably foreclosed3 All that is left open for further argument and determination is the force of the technical objections to the particular remedies avail able to the court in the discharge of its duty to enforce the judg mentwhether any of the processes stated are susceptible of being lawfully applied Such questions the court is careful to say that it does not now decide But one of them hardly admits of debate Accepting the decision that the legislature in the instant case is as subject to coercion as any inferior governmental agent would be its only remaining shield is the contention that its duties with re spect to raising money are discretionary and so cannot be enforced by mandamus But the cases are clear that its discretion is not over ridden when it fails to exercise it and is then compelled to do so The other question which the court asks of its own motion is more disputable Wellrecognized objections to the judicial levy of taxes do not necessarily lose their weight because carried over to novel situations Yet against these objections must be balanced the con siderations in favor of not permitting what are essentially technicali ties to deprive the Supreme Court of power to perform what it finds and declares to be its duty The problem under consideration affords interesting opportunity for various ways of looking at the law The treatment here given has been dominated by the attitude which regards the law after the thought of Mr Justice HOLMES as a prophecy of what courts will do in fact That is the law that clients wish to know about and the law that governs our affairs It may lack the enthralling spell of the law that ought to be but never is on sea or land the law that is right reason and the universal principles of justice the law that ac cords with our desires Right reason and the principles of justice are undoubtedly made manifest to us not exclusively through the decisions and the opinions of courts But it is that part which courts discover or make and then apply that determines what is legal and what illegal in the mundane practical life of man And so on the qlestion whether a state can be coerced by the Supreme Court of the United States it is of prime importance to know what the Supreme a 246 U S 565 604 3 246 U S 565 605 The exact order of the language of the Chief

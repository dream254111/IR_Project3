TODAY THE FUTURE AND THE CHURCH AS ORIGINALLY PLANNED THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE INCLUDED ALSO THE TOPICS EDUCATION THE PROBLEM OF THE CITY CON SERVATION OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND DEMOCRACY AND INTER NATIONALISM AS THE COURSE PROCEEDED CIRCUMSTANCES PECULIAR TO THE ORGANIZATION OF THIS PARTICULAR HIGH SCHOOL MADE IT IMPRACTICAL TO ATTEMPT TO COVER ALL OF THE TOPICS CONTEMPLATED THE FOREGOING SYLLABUS WILL GIVE THE READER AN INCORRECT IMPRES SION OF THE COURSE UNLESS HE INTERPRETS IT IN THE LIGHT OF THE FOLLOWING FACTS CONCERNING METHODS OF PRESENTATION AND THE REACTIONS OF THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES TECHNIQUE OF PRESENTATION IT WAS THOUGHT NECESSARY THAT THE PUPIL SECURE AT THE BEGINNING AS FAR AS POSSIBLE THE GROUP COOPERATIVE VIEWPOINT TWO DEVICES WERE UTILIZED IN ACCOMPLISHING THIS AN APPEAL TO THE STUDENTS OWN EXPERIENCE WITH GROUP LIFE SUCH AS FAMILY SCHOOL TEAMS CLUBS ETC AND THE READING OF A HISTORICAL NARRATIVE OF THE ORIGIN AND STEPBYSTEP DEVELOPMENT OF A WESTERN COMMUNITY IT IS DIFFICULT FOR A PUPIL TO VIEW HIS OWN COMMUNITY IN A MORE OR LESS IMPERSONAL AND OBJECTIVE MANNER ESPECIALLY IF IT BE A LARGE CITY IN ORDER TO ASSIST IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE COMMUNITY MIMEOGRAPHED SHEETS WITH SUGGESTIONS FOR POINTS TO BE OBSERVED6I8 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OCTOBER WERE PROVIDED NOT AS AN ASSIGNMENT TO SECURE A PARTICULAR NUMBER OF FACTS WHICH WHEN ARRAYED IN THE PROPER FORM COULD BE EXCHANGED FOR A SCHOOL GRADE BUT SIMPLY AS A GUIDE TO THE PUPILS OBSERVATION THE PURPOSE HERE WAS TO DEVELOP A VIEWPOINT NOT TO SECURE A DEFINITE AMOUNT OF WORK EACH GROUP REPORTED TO THE CLASS ON ITS OBSERVATIONS OF THE COMMUNITY VISITED AND IN MOST CASES PRESENTED A SKETCH MAP TO THE OTHER STUDENTS IN DESCRIBING THE LIFE OF THE COMMUNITY THE FOLLOWING IS THE OUTLINE GIVEN TO THE PUPILS AND DISCUSSED IN THE CLASSROOM PREVIOUS TO THE VISITATIONS OBSERVATION OF THE LIFE OF A COMMUNITY I NATURAL CONDITIONS I EXPLAINING THE LOCATION OF THE TOWN 2 NATURAL RESOURCES OF REGION TRIBUTARY TO THE TOWN 3 OTHER PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS II THE PEOPLE I POPULATION 2 RACES PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION 3 PECULIARITIES OF THE COMPOSITION OF THE POPULATION III INSTITUTIONS I

IX SKETCH MAP OF COMMUNITY I STREETS 2 INSTITUTIONS 3 TRANSPORTATION LINES 4 PHYSICAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHARACTERISTICS 5 OTHERS IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING TYPE OF WORK FIELD TRIPS WERE MADE DURING THE SCHOOL YEAR BY THE CLASS AND TEACHER BY GROUPS OR BY INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS TO THE FOLLOWING PLACES LYON  HEALYS PIANO FACTORY CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE CHICAGO STOCK EXCHANGE COOK COUNTY COURTHOUSE ELECTION POLLS SESSION OF CHICAGO CITY COUNCIL FIREDEPARTMENT STATIONS WATERPUMPING STATIONS HULL HOUSE AND THE STATE PENITENTIARY AT JOLIET THE PUPILS VOLUN TARILY GAVE THEIR SATURDAY MORNINGS AND AFTERSCHOOL HOURS FOR THESE TRIPS ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE EXERCISES OF THE YEAR WAS THE TRIP OF EACH STUDENT WITH HIS PARENT TO THE ELECTION POLLS AND THE EXPERIENCE MEETING DURING THE CLASS PERIOD ON THE FOLLOWING DAY A NUMBER OF FORMAL DEBATES DURING THE YEAR ON QUESTIONS CLOSELY RELATED TO THE WORK IN HAND PROVED INTERESTING AND STIMULATING STUDENTS ALSO TOOK THEIR WEEKLY TURN IN SURVEYING THE DAILY PAPERS FOR ARTICLES AND CARTOONS PERTINENT TO THE PROBLEM BEING STUDIED CARTOONS ARE OFTEN PARTICULARLY EFFECTIVE TEACHING DEVICES THE CLIPPINGS WERE POSTED ON THE CLASSROOM BULLETIN BOARD OTHER DEVICES WERE SPECIAL REPORTS AND OPEN CLASSROOM DISCUSSIONS NOTE BOOKS WERE REQUIRED THE STUDENTS REACTIONS NEAR THE CLOSE OF THE YEARS WORK THE STUDENTS WERE ASKED TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTIONS I THERE IS A MOVEMENT TO REQUIRE A COURSE OF THIS KIND OF ALL HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS WOULD YOU FAVOR OR OPPOSE  GIVE REASONS FOR YOUR ANSWER 2 IN WHICH OF THE PROBLEMS INCLUDED IN THIS COURSE WERE YOU MOST INTER ESTED  INDICATE YOUR PREFERENCE BY PLACING A I BEFORE YOUR FIRST PREFERENCE A 2 BEFORE YOUR SECOND PREFERENCE AND SO ON 3 WHICH OF THE MOST COMMONLY USED BOOKS DO YOU CONSIDER BEST FOR USE IN THIS COURSE RANK WITH NUMERALS AS YOU DID ABOVE GIVE BRIEFLY YOUR REASONS FOR YOUR FIRST PREFERENCE620 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OCTOBER 4 HOW DOES THE TIME REQUIRED FOR PREPARATIOR IN THIS COURSE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM COMPARE WITH THAT REQUIRED BY OTHER COURSES  5 ARE THE FIELD TRIPS TO INSTITUTIONS ETC WORTH WHILE GIVE YOUR REASONS 6 WHAT DO YOU CONSIDER THE WEAK POINTS OF THIS COURSE  THE STRONG POINTS  7 HOW IN YOUR OPINION MAY THE COURSE BE IMPROVED  BELOW ARE GIVEN THE RESULTS SO FAR AS THEY CAN BE SUMMARIZED AND REDUCED TO TABULATION I ON THE MATTER OF REQUIRING A COURSE IN MODERN SOCIAL PROB LEMS OF ALL HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS ONE WAS OPPOSED AND TWENTYSIX WERE IN FAVOR THE FOLLOWING ARE SEVEN TYPICAL COMMENTS MADE BY THOSE FAVORING I FAVOR MAKING IT REQUIRED BECAUSE IT TEACHES PUPILS TO THINK AS MUCH AS MATHEMATICS OR LATIN NOT ONLY DOES IT TEACH ONE TO THINK BUT ALSO HOW TO ORGANIZE BESIDES THESE THINGS IT IS OF SOME USE IT GIVES ONE A BROADER VIEW OF SOCIETY IN GENERAL I THINK THIS COURSE IS DIFFERENT FROM ALL THE REST WHICH MAKES IT ESPECIALLY DESIRABLE IT IS MORE PRACTICAL AS IT IS WHAT WE MEET EVERY DAY IF PEOPLE ARE TAUGHT THESE THINGS WHEN THEY ARE YOUNG THEY WILL BE AN INFLUENCE PERHAPS ON THEIR OWN LIVES OR THEY MAY BE ABLE TO INFLUENCE OTHERS THUS IT FORMS A BASIS FOR THE FUTURE IF PEOPLE ARE INTERESTED IN THIS SUBJECT EARLY THEY MAY BECOME A HELP TO SOCIETY WHEN THEY ARE OLDER MAKES THE STUDENT REALIZE THE PROBLEMS OF SOCIETY AND THE SERIOUS SIDE OF LIFE PROBLEMS LIKE LABOR AND INDUSTRY AND SOCIAL CONTROL BY GOVERN MENT WOULD BE OF ACTUAL VALUE TO ANY INDIVIDUAL IN MAKING A LIVING OR BEING A GOOD CITIZEN FAVOR MANY DONT GO TO COLLEGE AND WILL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE TO STUDY THESE PROBLEMS I FAVOR MAKING IT REQUIRED RIGHT ALONG WE HAVE BEEN GIVING AS REMEDIES FOR OUR SOCIAL DIFFICULTIES EDUCATION MAKING PEOPLE REALIZE THE IMPORTANCE OR THE DANGER OF SO AND SO CERTAINLY THERE IS NO BETTER WAY OF CARRYING OUT A PART OF THAT THAN RIGHT HERE AN APPRECIATION OF OUR SOCIAL PROBLEMS IS A GREAT ASSET TO ONES USEFULNESS IN ANY CAPACITY ONE OF THE THINGS OF GREAT VALUE WHICH I HAVE GOTTEN FROM THIS CLASS IS THE FACT THAT A GREAT FIELD OF NEW MATERIAL AND THOUGHT HAS BEEN OPENED FOR ME I PROBABLY WILL NOT REMEMBER ALL THE FACTS THAT I HAVE LEARNED HERE BUT I DO KNOW AND I SHALL NOT FORGET WHERE TO GET THEMZ9201 A COURSE IN MODERN SOCIAL PROBLEMS 621 I FAVOR IT GIVES A GRASP OF MANY PROBLEMS WITH WHICH WE DAILY COME IN CONTACT BESIDES ACQUAINTING US WITH PRESENTDAY PROBLEMS IT GIVES US VALUABLE TRAINING IN I USE OF TEXTBOOKS AND RESEARCH WORK TO OBTAIN MATERIAL 2 OBSERVATION OF ESSENTIAL TOPICS OF LITERATURE 3 ABILITY TO THINK 4 ABILITY TO COPE WITH LARGE QUESTIONS THAT ARE NOT LIMITED IN SCOPE AND 5 PRESENTING ARGUMENTS EFFECTIVELY THE OPPOSER SAID I OPPOSE I BELIEVE THAT ONLY MATHEMATICS AND ENGLISH SHOULD BE REQUIRED HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECTS WHILE THIS COURSE IS USEFUL AND WORTH WHILE IT IS NOT ESSENTIAL ENOUGH THAT IT SHOULD BE REQUIRED OF THE HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT 2 TABLE I SUMMARIZES THE PUPILS STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE RELATIVE INTEREST IN THE TOPICS STUDIED TABLE I POPULARITY OF TOPICS AMONG PUPILS PROPORTION OF

INTRODUCTORY NATURE AND THE LATTER  THE CHURCH AS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION WAS NOT ENTIRELY COMPLETED AT THE TIME OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE FROM THE TABLE ON POPULARITY OF TOPICS THAT IMMIGRATION AND ASSIMILATION WAS THE MOST POPULAR TOPIC WHILE SOCIAL PATHOLOGY WHICH AS PRESENTED WAS PRINCI PALLY A STUDY OF CRIME AND POVERTY CAME NEXT IN INTEREST TO THESE HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS LABOR AND INDUSTRY RANKED THIRD IN POPULARITY WHILE IT DOES NOT SEEM ADVISABLE TO USE SPACE TO PRESENT THE DETAILED TABULATION OF ALL THE RANKINGS YET THERE ARE SOME SIGNIFICANT FACTS TO BE POINTED OUT VARIATION IN THE PUPILS622 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OCTOBER INTERESTS IS INDICATED BY THE FACT THAT EACH ONE OF THE SIX TOPICS WAS RANKED AS BEING THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL BY ONE OR MORE PUPILS A COMPARISON OF THE PREFERENCES OF THE BOYS AND THE GIRLS SHOWS THAT THE BOYS CONSIDERED LABOR AND INDUSTRY THE MOST INTERESTING OF ALL WHILE THE GIRLS PLACED IT THIRD IN RANKING CON NECTED WITH THE FACT THAT THE GIRLS PREFERRED IMMIGRATION AND ASSIMILATION THE INFERENCE MIGHT BE MADE THAT GIRLS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN PEOPLE AND POPULATION AND BOYS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING A LIVING ANOTHER COMPARISON SHOULD BE NOTED IN THE CASE OF THE TOPIC SOCIAL CONTROL BY GOVERNMENT  NO GIRL PLACED IT FIRST OR SECOND AND ONLY ONE GIRL CONSIDERED IT OF SUFFICIENT INTEREST TO RANK IT AS THIRD AT THE SAME TIME 78 PER CENT OF THE GIRLS AS CONTRASTED TO 15 PER CENT OF THE BOYS CONSIDERED GOVERNMENT ONE OF THE TWO LEAST INTERESTING TOPICS THE ATTITUDE OF THE BOYS AS CONTRASTED TO THAT OF THE GIRLS TOWARD THE FAMILY AS A TOPIC FOR STUDY IS INTERESTING WE HAVE HERE ALMOST THE REVERSE OF THE SITUATION IN THE CASE OF  GOVERN MENT NO BOY RANKED THE FAMILY AS HIS FIRST OR SECOND PREF ERENCE AND ONLY ONE BOY CONSIDERED IT OF SUFFICIENT INTEREST TO RANK IT THIRD OVER 36 PER CENT OF THE BOYS RANKED IT SIXTH INDICATING THAT IT WAS THE LEAST INTERESTING OF ALL TO THEM AS A WHOLE THE BOYS RANKED THE FAMILY LAST AND GOVERNMENT FOURTH ON THE OTHER HAND THE GIRLS RANKED  GOVERNMENT LAST AND THE FAMILY FOURTH 3 THE RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION AS TO WHICH OF THE VARIOUS BOOKS ON SOCIAL SCIENCE FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS USED DURING THE YEAR WAS BEST SHOWED THAT ELLWOODS SOCIOLOGY AND MODERN PROBLEMS TOWNES SOCIAL PROBLEMS AND BURCH AND PATTERSONS AMERICAN SOCIAL PROB LEMS WERE THE MOST POPULAR WHILE IT DOES NOT SEEM ADVISABLE TO GIVE THE COMPLETE DATA THAT IS LISTING ALL THE BOOKS AND THEIR RANKINGS THE TABULATION BELOW WILL INDICATE THE RELATIVE POPULARITY OF THESE THREE NUMBER OF PUPILS RANKING FIRST SECOND THIRD BURCH AND PATTERSON  I 13 12 TOWNE 3 II 13 ELLWOOD22 3 I1920 A COURSE IN MODERN SOCIAL PROBLEMS 623 TWENTYTWO OUT OF TWENTYSEVEN PUPILS SAID THAT ELLWOODS SOCIOLOGY AND MODERN SOCIAL PROBLEMS WAS THE MOST DESIRABLE TEXT FOR A COURSE IN MODEM SOCIAL PROBLEMS A FEW QUOTATIONS WILL INDICATE WHAT THE HIGHSCHOOL STUDENT CONSIDERS THE PREREQUISITES OF A GOOD TEXTBOOK ELLWOOD VERY THOROUGH AND SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER INSIGHT INTO THE PROBLEMS THAN OTHER BOOKS WHEN I READ ELLWOOD I FEEL THAT I AM GETTING THE MAIN POINTS AND AM NOT BOTHERED WITH UNIMPORTANT DETAILS BURCH AND PATTERSON AN OUTLINE IS PRINTED AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH TOPIC SO THAT A BRIEF SUMMARY MIGHT BE SEEN AT ONCE AND A SLIGHE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TOPIC SECURED FEW STATISTICS AND EACH PARAGRAPH HAS ITS OUTSTANDING POINT IN HEAVY PRINT TOWNE ORGANIZATION IS ESPECIALLY GOOD IN REVIEWING YOU CAN FIND THE MAIN POINTS OF THE SUBJECT IN A SENTENCE OR TWO COVERS THE WHOLE FIELD AND BRINGS OUT THE IMPORTANT POINTS ELLWOOD IN MY OPINION THE STRONGEST FEATURE IN ITS FAVOR IS THAT IT POINTS OUT SO WELL THE UNDERLYING PRINCIPLES WHICH GOVERN THE FACTS IN GIVING REMEDIES OR CRITICIZING OTHERS THE AUTHOR ALWAYS GOES MUCH FURTHER BELOW THE SUPERFICIAL ASPECTS OF A SITUATION THAN THE OTHER WRITERS ELLWOOD MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE AUTHOR MORE ADVANCED MATERIAL STYLE MORE SCHOLARLY TERMINOLOGY MORE TECHNICAL CLEAR ORGANIZATION AND AN ADMIR ABLE LACK OF UNIMPORTANT STATISTICS ALTHOUGH NO TWO OF THE BOOKS USED COVER EXACTLY THE SAME FIELD YET A SURVEY OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY STUDENTS SEEMS TO INDICATE THAT THEY DO NOT CARE FOR STATISTICS AND AN ARRAY OF FACTS WHEN THE AUTHOR FAILS TO INTERPRET THEM FULLY STUDENTS ALSO SEEM TO APPRE CIATE VERY DEFINITELY A GOOD ORGANIZATION OF THE MATERIAL IT IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED THAT HIGHSCHOOL STUDENTS WILL INTERPRET COLD FACTS AND STATISTICS WITHOUT MUCH ASSISTANCE FROM AUTHOR OR TEACHER 4 THE FOURTH QUESTION WAS HOW DOES TIME REQUIRED FOR PREPARATION IN THIS COURSE OUTSIDE OF THE CLASSROOM COMPARE WITH THAT REQUIRED BY YOUR OTHER COURSES  A TABULATION OF THE REPLIES GIVES THE FOLLOWING RESULT MORE TIME 14 SAME AMOUNT OF TIME II LESS TIME 2 5 ARE THE FIELD TRIPS TO INSTITUTIONS ETC WORTH WHILE  NO 3 YES 24 THE PUPILS SEEM CONVINCED ON THIS POINT AND WERE624 THE SCHOOL REVIEW OCTOBER QUITE OUTSPOKEN IN THEIR REASONS THE FOLLOWING ARE SOME OF THE TYPICAL COMMENTS YOU CAN LEARN MORE BY VISITING A FACTORY WHEN YOU ARE STUDYING LABOR AND INDUSTRY THAN BY ALL THE READING PUT TOGETHER SOME LEARN MORE THIS WAY THAN IN CLASS AND UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEMS BETTER GIVES ONE A FEELING IN THE SUBJECT THAT IS IT ISNT LIKE A MATHEMATICS PROBLEM SEEING IS MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN READING IT IS EASIER TO GRASP THE CONCRETE THAN THE ABSTRACT I SOMETIMES LEARN MORE FROM A TRIP THAN FROM THREE OR FOUR DAYS OF STUDY BECAUSE WE CAN SEE THE ACTUAL FUNCTIONING OF THE INSTITUTIONS MAKES YOU SEE THE PROBLEMS MORE CLEARLY 6 THE PUPILS WERE ASKED TO STATE WHAT IN THEIR OPINIONS WERE THE WEAK AND STRONG POINTS OF THE COURSE THESE POINTS COVER BOTH THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE AND THE METHOD OF PRESENTATION THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE MOST REPEATED COMMENTS STRONG POINTS WEAK POINTS GIVES A REALIZATION AND APPRECIATION LACK OF SATISFACTORY TEXT MATERIAL OF SOCIAL PROBLEMS OBJECTIONS TO CERTAIN PROBLEMS ITS PRACTICAL VALUE NEED OF MORE CLASS DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY INTERESTING INSUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FIELD TRIPS PROMOTES BETTER CITIZENSHIP LENGTH OF TIME GIVEN TO PARTICULAR TRAINING IN THINKING TOPICS TRAINING IN ORGANIZATION TOO MUCH WRITTEN WORK THE POINT ON WHICH MOST AGREE IS THE LACK OF SATISFACTORY TEXT MATERIAL FOR THE COURSE AS A WHOLE CERTAINLY ALL TEACHERS OF SUCH COURSES AS THIS WILL AGREE IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT ONE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE ABSENCE OF A TEXTBOOK WAS A FAVORABLE FEATURE OF THE COURSE TWO PUPILS MENTIONED TRAINING IN HOW TO USE BOOKS AS A FAVORABLE POINT ONE OBJECTED TO TOO MUCH THEORY AND OTHERS SPOKE OF CLASS DISCUSSIONS AND TRIPS TO INSTITUTIONS AS STRONG POINTS ONE OF THE MOST FREQUENTLY REPEATED COMMENTS WAS THE PRACTICAL VALUE OF A COURSE OF THIS KIND ONE PUPIL WAS SO OUTSPOKEN ON THIS POINT THAT SHE STATED  THERE IS A TENDENCY TOWARD ACADEMIC IMPRACTICAL SUBJECTS IN HIGH SCHOOLS AND THERE IS A DEFINITE NEED FOR KNOWLEDGE OF PERTINENT SUBJECTS920O A COURSE IN MODERN SOCIAL PROBLEMS 625 7 WHILE THIS LAST QUESTION FROM ONE VIEWPOINT WAS A REPETITION OF THE PRECEDING ONE YET IT CALLED FOR CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVING THE COURSE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE SUGGESTIONS ON WHICH FOUR OR MORE PUPILS AGREED MORE FIELD TRIPS SECURING OF SATISFACTORY TEXT AND COLLATERAL MATERIAL INTRODUCTION OF MORE DAILY CURRENT EVENTS SELECTION OF A GREATER NUMBER OF MORE CONCRETE AND LESS EXTENSIVE PROBLEMS MORE CLASS DISCUSSION CONCLUSIONS I IF THIS GROUP OF PUPILS CAN BE ASSUMED TO BE TYPICAL THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT AS TO THE PREFERENCE OF HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS CONCERN ING THE DESIRABILITY OF INTRODUCING COURSES IN SOCIAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS ALTHOUGH IT DID NOT SEEM ADVISABLE TO INCLUDE THE QUESTION IN THE FOREGOING QUESTIONNAIRE YET AS AN ENTIRELY SEPARATE EXERCISE THE PUPILS WERE ASKED TO COMPARE THE COURSES THEY WERE TAKING AND WITHOUT GIVING THEIR NAMES OR MEANS OF IDENTIFICATION TO RANK THE SUBJECTS ACCORDING TO THEIR VALUE TO THEM WHILE AN EFFORT WAS MADE TO SECURE ONLY SINCERE NON PREJUDICED ANSWERS NEVERTHELESS THE REPLIES MUST BE TAKEN WITH RESERVATIONS THE TABULATION OF RANKINGS SHOWS THAT OF 27 PUPILS 17 CONSIDERED THE COURSE IN MODERN PROBLEMS THE MOST VALUABLE ONE BEING TAKEN NINE RANKED IT SECOND AND ONE RANKED IT THIRD PRACTICALLY EVERY HIGHSCHOOL SUBJECT WAS REPRESENTED IN THE RANKINGS A GOODLY NUMBER WERE TAKING MATHEMATICS FRENCH ENGLISH AND PHYSICS 2 IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT WHEN THESE NEW SOCIALSCIENCE COURSES ARE INTRODUCED FORMALISTIC METHODS OF PRESENTATION WILL BE AVOIDED THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES WITHOUT LABORATORY WORK AND FIELD TRIPS WOULD BE OF CONSIDERABLY LESS VALUE THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE SOCIAL SCIENCES FOR THE HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS IT IS TRUE THAT THE COURSE AS DESCRIBED REQUIRES PREPARATION TIME AND ENERGY ON THE PART OF THE TEACHER IT IS RECOMMENDED THAT WHERE PRACTICAL THE TIME SCHEDULE PROVIDE FOR A LABORATORY OR A FIELD TRIP PERIOD FOR THIS AND SIMILAR COURSES 3 MORE MATERIAL ADAPTED TO HIGHSCHOOL PUPILS IS NEEDED THE CONTENT OF THE COURSE SHOULD BE OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST AND OF PRACTICAL VALUE TO THE GIRLS AS WELL AS TO THE BOYS THE MATERIAL626 THE SCHOOL REVIEW MUST BE SOMETHING MORE THAN AN ARRAY OF FACTS AND STATISTICS THESE FACTS MUST BE GIVEN A LIVING MEANING AND THE PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING THEM MUST BE MADE EVIDENT 4 A COURSE OF THIS KIND REQUIRES CONSIDERABLE READING THE WRITERS EXPERIENCE LEADS HIM TO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS DANGER THAT TOO EXTENSIVE NOTETAKING WILL DETRACT FROM THE VALUE AND INTEREST OF THE COURSE DISCRETION SHOULD BE USED AND FOR SOME KINDS OF MATERIALS FEW OR NO NOTES SHOULD BE REQUIRED 5 BECAUSE OF THE ABSTRACTNESS OF SOCIAL SCIENCE MUCH OPEN CLASS DISCUSSION IS NECESSARY AS WAS SO FREQUENTLY AND INSISTENTLY EXPRESSED BY THE STUDENTS IN THEIR COMMENTS HOWEVER THIS SHOULD NOT LEAD TO MERE FORENSIC EXCHANGE OF IGNORANT OPINION THE TEACHER IS RESPONSIBLE IN THIS MATTER IF HE IS SPECIALLY PRE PARED FOR THIS WORK HE CAN AND WILL GUIDE THE DISCUSSION ALONG PROFITABLE LINES ADEQUATE PREPARATION IS JUST AS NECESSARY FOR THE SOCIALSCIENCE TEACHER AS IT IS FOR THE CHEMISTRY TEACHER IT IS HOPED THAT THESE NEW COURSES WILL NOT EXPERIENCE THE FATE OF MANY HISTORY COURSES WHEN FIRST INTRODUCED NAMELY THAT OF BEING DOLED OUT TO TEACHERS OF MATHEMATICS LATIN ENGLISH AGRICULTURE DOMESTIC SCIENCE AND MANUAL TRAINING

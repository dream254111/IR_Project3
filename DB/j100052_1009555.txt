J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009555,THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA A STUDY IN IRRESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT,I242503,BRIEFER COMMUNICATIONS THZ RAILROAD COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA A STUDY IN IRRI SPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT THE REASON WHY POLITICAL SCIENCE IS LESS RIGOROUSLY EXACT THAN THE NATURAL SCIENCES IS FOUND IN THE DIFFICULTY OF ISOLATING ITS PHENOMENA DIRECT EXPERIMENT BEING IMPOSSIBLE WE MUST DRAW OUR CONCLUSIONS FROM OBSERVING WHAT GOES ON AROUND US AND THERE IS USUALLY SUCH A MIXTURE OF CAUSES AND EFFECTS TO OBSERVE THAT WE CAN FIND PLAUSIBLE GROUNDS FOR ALMOST ANY SORT OF CONCLUSION WE PLEASE TO EXTRACT HENCE THE SCIENTIFIC VALUE OF THOSE RARE CASES IN WHICH ALL COMPLICATING ELEMENTS ARE REMOVED AND WE ARE ALLOWED THE PRIVILEGE OF STUDYING REACTIONS AS SIMPLE AND DETERMINATE AS THOSE THE CHEMIST PRODUCES IN THE LABORATORY THE QUESTION WHETHER OUR PRESENT SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS REALLY DEMOCRATIC OR NOT IS ONE THAT MUST BE ANSWERED BY EXPERIENCE THE THEORY IS THAT WE ELECT TO OFFICE MEN WHO HOLD CERTAIN IDEAS ABOUT PUBLIC POLICIES ALLOW THEM TO SERVE FOR FIXED TERMS AND THEN IF THEY HAVE NOT GIVEN SATISFACTION ELECT OTHERS IN THEIR PLACES THIS PLAN IS SAID TO BE DEMOCRATIC BECAUSE IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE WISHES OF THE PEOPLE WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE ACTION OF THE MEN THEY ELECT IF NOT AFTER THE FIRST ELECTION CERTAINLY AFTER THE SECOND WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE A GOOD MANY UNSETTLED OR UNSATISFACTORILY SETTLED QUESTIONS BEFORE CONGRESS SUCH AS THE SUBJECTS OF SILVER AND THE TARIFF NOTWITH STANDING THE FREQUENT RECURRENCE OF ELECTIONS IN WHICH THE PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CHANCE TO EXPRESS THEIR DESIRES BUT IT MAY BE SAID THAT THESE HAVE BEEN SO CONFUSED BY THE NUMBER OF OTHER ISSUES WITH WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN MINGLED THAT THESE HAS BEEN NO CHANCE TO SECURE AN UNMISTAKABLE POPULAR MANDATE AND TELL WHETHER OR NOT IT HAS BEEN CARRIED OUT HERE IS THE VALUE OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSION OF CALIFORNIA AS AN OBJECT LESSON THERE ARE NO COMPLICATIONS WHATEVER HERE WE HAVE A BODY CREATED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO FOR ONE DEFINITE PURPOSE AND FREQUENTLY RENEWED WITH ITS MANDATE UNCHANGED IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO IMAGINE A BETTER TEST OF THE QUESTION WHETHER WITH OUR POLITICAL MACHINERY THE PEOPLE REALLY GOVERN IN TRACING THE HISTORY OF THIS EXPERIMENT I SHALL CAREFULLY REFRAIN FROM DISCUSSING THE MERITS OF THE RAILROAD QUESTION IN CALIFORNIA I SHALL EXPRESS NO OPINIONS ABOUT THE MOTIVES OR THE WISDOM OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS MY PURPOSE IS SIMPLY TO THROW SOME LIGHT UPON THE QUESTION HOW FAR THE POLITICAL 469I I ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY MACHINERY IN USE IN EVERY STATE OF THE UNION PERMITS THE MATURED WISHES OF THE PEOPLE TO BE CARRIED INTO EFFECT ONE OF THE CHIEF CONSIDERATIONS THAT LED TO THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW CONSTITUTION OF CALIFORNIA IN I879 WAS THE POPULAR DESIRE TO REDUCE AND REGULATE THE CHARGES OF THE CENTRAL PACIFIC RAILROAD AND ITS AFFILIATED LINES NOW ALL CONTROLLED BY THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY THERE HAD BEEN DISCONTENT AND AGITATION FROM THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE OPERATION OF THE ROAD EACH SUCCESSIVE LEGISLATURE HAD BEEN EXPECTED TO DO SOMETHING BUT THE LEGISLATIVE MACHINERY HAD SHOWN ITS USUAL INCAPACITY TO DEAL WITH SUCH MATTERS AND EACH SESSION HAD CLOSED WITH NOTHING ACCOMPLISHED AT ONE TIME THREE COMMISSIONERS OF TRANS PORTATION WERE APPOINTED UNDER AN ACT AFTERWARD DECLARED UNCONSTITU TIONAL AND ALTHOUGH THEY COULD DO NOTHING BUT GIVE ADVICE WHICH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD NOT FOLLOW THEIR ADVICE SEEMED SO GOOD THAT THE PEOPLE THOUGHT THAT THE RELEGATION OF THE WHOLE RAILROAD QUESTION TO SUCH A COMMISSION WOULD PROVE A PANACEA FOR ALL THE ILLS FROM WHICH THEY BELIEVED THEMSELVES TO BE SUFFERING ACCORDINGLY WHEN THE NEW CONSTITUTION WAS FRAMED A RAILROAD COMMISSION WAS CREATED WITH AUTOCRATIC POWERS IT WAS TO CONSIST OF THREE MEMBERS ELECTED BY DISTRICTS FOR FOUR YEARS AFTER THE FIRST TERM WHICH WAS TO END IN THREE YEARS  SAID COMMISSIONERS SAID THE CONSTITUTION  SHALL HAVE THE POWER AND IT SHALL BE THEIR DUTY TO ESTABLISH RATES OF CHARGES FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF PASSENGERS AND FREIGHT BY RAILROAD OR OTHER TRANS PORTATION COMPANIES AND PUBLISH THE SAME FROM TIME TO TIME WITH SUCH CHANGES AS THEY MAY MAKE THEY WERE ALSO TO HEAR AND DETERMINE COMPLAINTS AGAINST TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES AND WERE INVESTED WITH POWER TO ADMINISTER OATHS TAKE TESTIMONY COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE AND PUNISH FOR CONTEMPT IN THE SAME MAN NER AND TO THE SAME EXTENT AS COURTS OF RECORD HEAVY PENALTIES WERE TO BE IMPOSED FOR ANY VIOLATION OF THE ORDERS OF THE COMMISSION AND IT WAS PROVIDED THAT IN ALL CONTROVERSIES CIVIL AND CRIMINAL THE RATES OF FARES AND FREIGHTS ESTABLISHED BY THIS BODY SHOULD BE DEEMED CONCLUSIVELY JUST AND REASONABLE AND THAT IN ANY ACTION AGAINST A CORPORATION FOR DAMAGES SUSTAINED BY CHARGING EXCESSIVE RATES THE PLAINTIFF IN ADDITION TO THE ACTUAL DAMAGES MIGHT IN THE DISCRETION OF THE JUDGE OR JURY RECOVER EXEMPLARY DAMAGES THE COMPENSATION OF THE COMMISSIONERS WAS FIXED BY LAW AT 4OOO A YEAR THE FIRST ELECTION WAS HELD IN 1879 AND THE COMMISSIONERS ELECT WERE DIVIDED AMONG THREE PARTIES THE FIRST DISTRICT ELECTED JOSEPH H CONE A REPUBLICAN THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM UPON WHICH MR CONE WAS NOMINATED HAD THIS TO SAY OF THE RAILROAD QUESTION  THAT IN THE OPINION OF THIS CONVENTION JUSTICE DEMANDS THE PRESENT RATE OF FARES AND FREIGHTS ON ALL LINES IN THE STATE WHICH HAVE 470CAIIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION RECEIVED STATE OR NATIONAL AID OUGHT TO BE REDUCED AT LEAST 25 PER CENT  IN THE SECOND DISTRICT THE SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATE WAS C J BEERSTECHER OF THE WORKINGMENS PARTY WHEN MR BEERSTECHER HAD BEEN NOMI NATED HE HAD IMMEDIATELY TAKEN THE STRINGENT PLEDGES REQUIRED BY THE CONVENTION THAT PLACED HIM IN THE FIELD THE PLATFORM UPON WHICH HE STOOD DECLARED THAT  CHARGES FOR FREIGHTS AND FARES ON RAILROADS AND FOR THE USE OF WATER GAS AND ALL OTHER NECESSITIES OF CIVILIZED LIFE THAT ARE MONOPOLIZED MUST BE SO REGULATED THAT THERE SHALL BE NO DISCRIMINATION BETWEEN PERSONS AND PLACES AND THAT CAPITAL ACTUALLY IN RAILROAD WATER AND GAS RIGHTS SHOULD YIELD NO GREATER INCOME THAN CAPITAL INVESTED IN FARMING AND OTHER PRODUCTIVE INDUSTRIES THE PLATFORM ALSO ANNOUNCED THE PRINCIPLE THAT  ANY OFFICIAL WHO SHALL VIOLATE THE PLEDGES GIVEN TO SECURE HIS ELECTION SHOULD BE PUNISHED AS A FELON THE CANDIDATES WERE FURTHERMORE REQUIRED TO TAKE A PLEDGE  THAT OFFICERS SHALL RESIGN WHEN CALLED UPON TO DO SO BY A CONVENTION CALLED FOR THAT PURPOSE IN THE JURISDICTION IN WHICH THEY WERE ELECTED THE THIRD DISTRICT HAD ELECTED GENERAL GEORGE STONEMAN WHO HAD MADE A POPULAR RECORD AS A COMMISSIONER OF TRANSPORTATION UNDER THE OLD LAW GENERAL STONEMAN WAS A DEMOCRAT AND ALSO HAD THE WORK INGMENS NOMINATION THE DEMOCRATIC POSITION ON THE RAILROAD QUES TION AS EXPRESSED IN THE PARTY PLATFORM WAS THIS THAT THE RAILROAD AND OTHER TRANSPORTATION CORPORATIONS IN CALIFOR NIA SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO STATE REGULATION OF RATES FOR PASSAGE AND FREIGHT IN ORDER THAT A MATERIAL REDUCTION SHALL BE MADE THAT UNJUST AND DISCRIMINATING RATES SHALL NOT BE IMPOSED OR EXTORTED AND THAT THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE REDUCTION SHOULD PARTICULARLY APPLY TO THE RAILROAD WHICH HAD BEEN SUBSIDIZED THUS THE MEMBERS OF THE FIRST RAILROAD COMMISSION WERE UNANI MOUSLY COMMITTED APPARENTLY WITH A SOLID POPULAR BACKING TO A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN RATES THE ONLY ONE HOWEVER WHO SERIOUSLY ATTEMPTED TO CARRY OUT THIS POLICY WAS GENERAL STONEMAN THE REPORTS OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COMMISSION WERE FILLED WITH APOLOGIES FOR THE EXISTING RATES COMPARISONS BETWEEN CALIFORNIAN AND EASTERN CONDITIONS SHOWING THAT THE CENTRAL PACIFIC WAS TREATING THE PUBLIC QUITE AS WELL AS COULD BE EXPECTED UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND DISSERTATIONS UPON THE COMPLEXITY OF THE RAILROAD PROBLEM THE NEED FOR PATIENT INVESTIGATION AND STUDY THE DUTY OF PRESERVING A CALM AND JUDICIAL ATTITUDE OF MIND AND THE INIQUITY OF YIELDING TO POPULAR CLAMOR NO REDUCTIONS WERE ORDERED WHICH THE COMPANY WAS NOT PREPARED AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS POLICY TO GRANT WITHOUT THE INTER FERENCE OF THE COMMISSION 471 IIIANNALS OF THE AMIRICAN ACADEMY I REPEAT THAT IT IS NOT MY PURPOSE TO EXPRESS ANY OPINION REGARDING THE MERITS OF THIS COURSE I AM MERELY DISCUSSING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR USUAL GOVERNMENTAL MACHINERY AS A MEANS OF GETTING POPULAR DESIRES TRANSLATED INTO ACTION IN I882 A NEW ELECTION WAS HELD COMMISSIONERS CONE AND BEER STECHER DISAPPEARED FROM POLITICS AND WERE NEVER HEARD OF AGAIN THE WORKINGMENS PARTY PASSED OUT OF EXISTENCE COMMISSIONER STONEMAN WHO HAD ATTEMPTED TO MEET THE PUBLIC EXPECTATIONS WAS PROMOTED TO THE GOVERNORSHIP THE DEMOCRATS ELECTED ALL THREE OF THE NEW COMMISSIONERS AS WELL AS ALL THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AND ALL THE STATE OFFICERS THUS FAR THE AMERICAN THEORY OF GOVERNMENT HAD WORKED ACCORDING TO THE ACCEPTED RULES THREE PARTIES HAD BEEN TESTED TWO OF THEM HAD DISAPPOINTED THE PUBLIC AND HAD BEEN TURNED OUT THE THIRD HAD BEEN REWARDED FOR ITS OBSERVANCE OF ITS PLEDGES BY A COMPLETE GRANT OF POWER OFFICIALS WHO HAD FAILED TO KEEP THEIR PROMISES HAD BEEN RETIRED TO PRIVATE LIFE AND THE ONE WHO HAD RETAINED THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE HAD BEEN ADVANCED TO A HIGHER PLACE THE EFFECT OF THIS CONSISTENT APPLICATION OF REWARDS AND PUNISHMENTS ACCORDING TO THE THEORY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE PROMPT EXECUTION OF THE POPULAR WILL BY THE NEWLY ELECTED OFFICIALS THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM UPON WHICH THE NEW RAILROAD COMMIS SIONERS WERE ELECTED CONTAINED THE FOLLOWING TRANLPORTATION PLANK RESOLVED THAT THE RAILROAD FARES AND FREIGHTS SHOULD BE MATERIALLY REDUCED DISCRIMINATIONS IN FAVOR OF LOCALITIES OR PERSONS SHOULD BE PROHIBITED AND WE CON DEMN THE MAJORITY OFTHE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS OF THIS STATE FOR THEIR FAITHLESSNESS IN THE DISCHARGE OF THEIR OFFICIAL DUTIES THE NOMINEES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY WILL IF ELECTED CARRY OUT IN LETTER AND SPIRIT THE DECLARATIONS OF THIS RESOLUTION AND RELIEVE THE PEOPLE TO THE EXTENT OF THEIR JURISDICTION FROM THE EXACTIONS AND INJUSTICE NOW PRACTICED WITH IMPUNITY BY THE RAILROAD CORPORATIONS THE THREE COMMISSIONERS ELECTED ON THIS PLATFORM WERE G J CAR PENTER W P HUMPHREYS AND W W FOOTE SOON AFTER THEIR NOMI NATION THEY AVAILED THEMSELVES OF A RATIFICATION MEETING IN SAN FRANCISCO TO EXPRESS THEIR PERSONAL CONCURRENCE IN THE VIEWS OF THE CONVENTION IN A LETTER FROM PLACERVILLE MR CARPENTER WROTE AT THE TIME OF MY NOMINATION I PERSONALLY APPROVED AND ENDORSED THE PLATFORM AND RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE DEMOCRATIC STATE CONVENTION HAVING READ THEM CAREFULLY I HAVE REGARDED AND NOW REGARD THEM AS THE LATEST AND BEST DECLARATION OF DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES IN THEIR PRACTICAL APPLICATION TO THE LIVING QUESTIONS AND IMPERATIVE DEMANDS OF THE TIME THUS REGARDED FOR ME WHETHER IN PRIVATE LIFE OR OFFICIAL STATION THEY WILL BE GOVERNING RULES OF ACTION JEFFERSOUIAN PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT MADE EFFECTIVE BY JACKSONIAN FIRMNESS AND FEARLESSNESS IN THEIR APPLICATION CONSTITUTE THE MODE AND MEASURE OF REFORM WHICH THE PEOPLE AT LARGE ARE RIGHTFULLY DEMANDING 472 II2CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION WHEN THEY SHALL HAVE GIVEN EFFECT TO THEIR DEMANDS BY A POPULAR VERDICT AT THE BALLOT BOX THE PLEDGE OF THE CANDIDATE WILL BE VERIFIED BY THE OATH OF THE OFFICERFOR MYSELF I AGAIN REITERATE MY PLEDGE OF ADHERENCE TO THE PLATFORM AND RESOLUTIONS ESPECIALLY THOSE RELATING TO THE IMPORTANT AND RESPONSIBLE POSITION FOR WHICH I AM A CANDIDATE IF ELECTED IT WILL BECOME AND BE MY DUTY TO JUSTIFY THE CONFIDENCE REPOSED IN ME BY MAKING MY OFFICE TO THE EXTENT OF MY ABILITY SUB SERVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTS OF ITS CREATION IN MY OFFICE AS A MEMBER AND SPEAKER OF A CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY I WAS BROUGHT FACE TO FACE WITH SOME OF THE QUESTIONS AT ISSUE BETWEEN THE PEOPLE AND THE TRANSPORTATION COMPANIES IN THE APPOINTMENT OF COMMITTEES IN THE VOTES AS RECORDED TOUCHING THESE QUESTIONS MY ATTITUDE CAN BE CLEARLY TRACED THEY WERE IN HARMONY WITH THE POPULAR SENTIMENTS OF THE TIMES THEY PROVOKED THE BITTER HOSTILITY OF THE RAILROAD COMPANIES AND I HAVE NOT DONE ANYTHING SINCE TO RECONCILE DIFFERENCES WITH THE CORPORATIONS OR TO FORFEIT THE CONFIDENCE OR GOOD OPINION OF THE PUBLIC AT THE SAME TIME MR HUMPHREYS SENT A LETTER IN WHICH HE SAID AMONG OTHER THINGS IF I WERE TO BE GUIDED BY PRECEDENT I WOULD LIMIT MYSELF TO A DECLARATION THAT I FAVOR THE LETTER AND SPIRIT OF THE PLATFORM HOW EVER I REITERATE THE ENDORSEMENT AS EXPRESSED IN MY LETTER OF JUNE 27 TO THE STATE CENTRAL COMMITTEE IF I AM ELECTED I SHALL ENDEAVOR TO ENFORCE THE CENTRAL IDEA EMBODIED IN THE PLATFORM SO FAR AS THE RAILROAD COMMISSION IS CONCERNED I SHALL ATTEMPT TO REDRESS GRIEVANCES TO PREVENT EXTORTION AND DISCRIMINATION IN THE DEALINGS BETWEEN TRANS PORTATION COMPANIES AND THEIR PATRONS WHETHER AS TO PERSONS OR PLACES AND TO OBTAIN SUCH A MODIFICATION AND REDUCTION OF FREIGHT AND PASSENGER RATES OVER THE RAILWAYS OF THE STATE AS SHALL BE JUST AND EQUITABLE AND AS SHALL MEET THE PUBLIC EXPECTATION AND APPROVAL THE CONVENTION AT SAN JOSE REJECTED RESOLUTIONS LOOKING TO A GENERAL REDUCTION OF A SPECIFIC PERCENTAGE OF FREIGHTS AND FARES AND FAILED TO ACT ON ANOTHER RESOLUTION BROUGHT FORWARD BY SOME MEMBER HAVING FOR ITS OBJECT THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THE COSTS OF ROADS AND THE ADJUST MENT OF TRANSPORTATION CHARGES SO AS TO ALLOW THE OWNERS OF THE ROADS THEIR OPERATING EXPENSES AND A FAIR RETURN FOR THE USE OF THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED NOT EXCEEDING 6 PER CENT THEREON IT SEEMS TO ME THAT SOME SUCH PRINCIPLE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROPERLY ENGRAFTED ON THE PLAT FORM HAD IT BEEN IT WOULD HAVE MET MY CORDIAL APPROVAL IT SUG GESTS ITSELF FURTHER THAT THIS IDEA FURNISHES A BASIS FOR A SOLUTION OF A COMPLICATED PROBLEM OR RATHER THAT UPON THAT PRINCIPLE A RAILROAD COMMISSIONER MAY REACH A SCALE OF TARIFFS THAT WILL BE JUST AND RELIEVE THE PUBLIC FROM THE BURDENS AND OPPRESSIONS OF WHICH THEY NOW 473 I 13I 4 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COMPLAIN IF I AM ELECTED MY FIRST OFFICIAL EFFORTS WILL PROCEED UPON THE THEORY HERE INDICATED WHICH I TAKE TO BE IN STRICT HARMONY WITH THE ANTIMONOPLY PLANK OF THE PLATFORM MR FOOTE EXPRESSED HIMSELF STRONGLY TO A SIMILAR EFFECT BUT AS HE DID NOT SUBSEQUENTLY CHANGE HIS VIEWS IT IS UNNECESSARY TO QUOTE HIS EXPRESSIONS THE REPUBLICAN DECLARATIONS ON THE RAILROAD QUESTION WERE AS DECIDED AS THE DEMOCRATIC THUS THE SECOND RAILROAD COMMISSION LIKE THE FIRST TOOK OFFICE BACKED BY AN APPARENTLY UNANIMOUS POPULAR DEMAND FOR THE REDUCTION OF FARES AND FREIGHTS AND THE ABOLITION OF DISCRIMINATIONS BUT ITS CAREER WAS A REPETITION OF THAT OF ITS PREDE CESSOR A MINORITY OF ONEMR FOOTEATTEMPTED TO CARRY OUT THE PROMISES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM THE MAJORITYMR CARPENTER AND MR HUMPHREYSFOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE SET BY MESSRS CONE AND BEERSTECHER NOMINAL REDUCTIONS IN RATES OF A NATURE SATISFACTORY TO TO THE COMPANY WERE ORDERED AND THE REPORTS OF THE COMMISSION WERE TURNED INTO BRIEFS IN DEFENCE OF THE RAILROAD AND IN DENUNCIATION OF ITS OPPONENTS PUBLIC FEELING WAS SO AROUSED THAT IN I884 GOV ERNOR STONEMAN CALLED AN EXTRA SESSION OF THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE PUR POSE AMONG OTHER THINGS OF SUBMITTING TO THE PEOPLE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CHANGING THE METHOD OF ELECTING THE RAILROAD COMMISSION AS USUAL THE CORPORATION FOUND NO DIFFICULTY IN CONTROLLING THE LEGIS LATURE ALTHOUGH IT HAD BEEN ELECTED AS A DISTINCTLY ANTIMONOPOLY BODY AND NOTHING WAS DONE THE DEMOCRATS HAD ENTIRE POSSESSION OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT AND WHEN THEIR STATE CONVENTION MET IN THE SAME YEAR IT FORMALLY READ OUT OF THE PARTY THE VARIOUS STATE OFFICIALS AND LEGISLATORS WHO HAD AIDED THE RAILROAD WITH REGARD TO THE MAJORITY OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSION IT SAID  RESOLVED THAT WE ARE NOT UNMINDFUL OF THE CONDUCT OF CERTAIN DEMOCRATIC OFFICERS AND LEGISLATORS WHO COOPERATED WITH THE REPUBLICANS AT THE LATE EXTRA SESSION IN FRUSTRATING THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE AND ANTAGONIZING THE TRUE INTERESTS OF THE STATE THAT WHILE NO AMOUNT OF CARE CAN AT ALL TIMES PREVENT THE INTRUSION INTO POLITICS OF FAITHLESS MEN WHO ENTER WITH A FALSE PLEDGE UPON THEIR LIPS MERELY TO RUIN AND BETRAYYET THE PARTY BECOMES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONDUCT OF SUCH RECREANT MEMBERS ONLY WHEN HAVING DISCOVERED THEM IT FAILS TO CONDEMN THEIR COURSE THAT IT IS THE DUTY OF A PARTY IF IT BE TRUE TO ITSELF AND THE PEOPLE TO EXPEL FROM ITS RANKS AND DENOUNCE AS UNWORTHY OF PUBLIC TRUST AND LOST TO ALL SENSE OF HONOR TRAITORS AND PLEDGEBREAKERS THEREFORE WE DO NOW DENOUNCE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS CARPENTER AND HUMPHREYS WHO HAVE BROKEN THEIR PLEDGES WITH REFERENCE TO FREIGHT AND FARE REDUCTIONS THE NAMES OF OTHER CONDEMNED OFFICIALS FOLLOWED AND THE CONVEN TION RECOMMENDED THE ADOPTION OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT VACAT ING THE PLACES OF THE RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS AUTHORIZING TEMPORARY APPOINTMENTS BY THE GOVERNOR TO FILL THE VACANCIES AND PROVIDING FOR A NEW MODE OF ELECTION THEREAFTER 474CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION ALL THIS PROVED A WASTE OF BREATH THE  READOUT  OFFICERS SHOWED NO SIGNS OF CONTRITION AND THE SUBSEQUENT REPORTS OF COMMISSIONERS CARPENTER AND HUMPHREYS WERE BLASTS OF DEFIANCE AGAINST THE  DEMA GOGUES WHO CONTINUED TO HOLD THE SAME VIEWS ON THE RAILROAD QUES TION WHICH THEY HAD EXPRESSED BEFORE THEIR ELECTION THEY RETAINED THEIR PLACES UNTIL THE END OF THEIR TERMS WHEN THEY DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW AND WERE NEVER HEARD OF IN POLITICS AGAIN BY THIS TIME THE PEOPLE HAD BECOME WEARY OF A FUTILE AGITATION WHICH HAD BEEN PROLONGED WITH LITTLE INTERMISSION FOR NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AND SETTLED INTO AN APATHY WHICH LASTED DURING THE GREATER PART OF THE NEXT TWO TERMS THE REPUBLICANS CONTROLLED THE RAILROAD COMMISSION DURING THIS PERIOD AND THE ATTEMPT TO MAKE IT FULFILL THE PURPOSE OF ITS CREATION WAS FRANKLY ABANDONED BUT IN 1894 THE ANTI MONOPOLY SPIRIT REVIVED AGAIN STIMULATED BY THE APPROACHING MATUR ITY OF THE PACIFIC RAILROAD DEBTS TO THE GOVERNMENT AND BY THE TIME THE DEMOCRATIC STATE CONVENTION MET IT WAS BLAZING AS HOTLY AS EVER THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM WAS DEVOTED ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY TO THE RAILROAD QUESTION UPON THE SUBJECT OF LOCAL RATES IT SAID  WHEREAS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PAYS EIGHTY PER CENT OF THE GROSS EARNINGS OF THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAILROAD SYSTEM SAID GROSS EARNINGS AGGREGATING 48OOO OOO ANNUALLY THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT THE CHARGES FOR THE TRANSPORTATION OF FREIGHTS IN CALIFORNIA BY THE SOUTHERN PACIFIC COMPANY OF KENTUCKY AND ITS LEASED LINES IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE SUBJECTED TO AN AVERAGE REDUCTION OF NOT LESS THAN TWENTYFIVE PER CENT AND WE PLEDGE OUR NOMINEES FOR RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS TO MAKE THIS REDUCTION SO JUSTLY DEMANDED BY THE PEOPLE  WE PLEDGE OUR CANDIDATES FOR THE RAILROAD COMMISSION TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF FREIGHT CLASSIFICATIONS ONEHALF AND THAT DURING THEIR TERM OF OFFICE THEY SHALL PURSUE THEIR OFFICIAL LABOR UNHAMPERED BY THE DEMAND OF ANY OTHER BUSINESS OR AVOCATION AND WE FURTHER PLEDGE THEM TO INITIATE NEEDED REFORMS IN THE FREIGHT SCHEDULES AND CLASSIFICATION WITHOUT A FORMAL COMPLAINT BEING FILED ON THIS PLATFORM THE DEMOCRATS ELECTED TWO OUT OF THE THREE NEW RAILROAD COMMISSIONERS ONE OF THEM MR H M LA RUE HAD BEEN KNOWN AS A CONSISTENT AND AGGRESSIVE ANTIMONOPOLIST SINCE THE FIRST INTRUSION OF THE RAILROAD QUESTION INTO THE POLITICS OF CALIFORNIA IN ADDITION TO THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION HE HAD RECEIVED THAT OF THE TRAFFIC ASSOCIATION AN ORGANIZATION OF MERCHANTS ESTABLISHED EXPRESSLY TO SECURE BETTER TERMS FOR SHIPPERS HE WAS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE WHICH FRAMED THE RAILROAD PLANK OF THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM AND EXPRESSED HIS DESIRE AT THE TIME FOR EVEN GREATER REDUCTIONS IN RATES THAN THOSE WHICH WERE PROMISED THE OTHER DR J I STANTON BOUND HIMSELF IN THE MOST EXPLICIT MANNER TO CARRY OUT THE PROMISES OF THE PLATFORM AND THE FRIEND WHO PLACED HIM IN NOMINATION DECLARED THAT IT WAS HIS DESIRE TO GIVE HIS LIFE IF NECESSARY TO DOWN THE CORPORATION 475 II516 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY FOR OVER SEVEN MONTHS AFTER TAKING OFFICE THE NEW COMMISSIONERS REMAINED QUIESCENT THEN MR LA RUE INTRODUCED A RESOLUTION REDUCING RATES ON GRAIN DR STANTON JOINED THE REPUBLICAN COM MISSIONER IN OPPOSING IT URGING DELAY AND INVESTIGATION AND EMPLOY ING PRECISELY THE SAME ARGUMENTS THAT HAD BEEN ADVANCED BY CONE AND BEERSTECHER FIFTEEN YEARS BEFORE IT SEEMED EVIDENT THAT FOR THE REST OF ITS TERM THE PRESENT COMMISSION WOULD CONSIST OF A MINORITY OF ONE IN FAVOR OF REDUCTIONS AND A MAJORITY OF TWO AGAINST THEM JUST AS IN THE CASE OF ITS EARLIEST PREDECESSORS THE PRESSURE WAS SO GREAT HOWEVER THAT COMMISSIONERS STANTON AND CLARK SURPRISED THE PUBLIC BY SUDDENLY CONSENTING TO A REDUCTION OF 8 PER CENT IN GRAIN RATES WHICH WITH THE PREVIOUS REDUCTION VOLUNTARILY MADE BY THE COMPANY MADE A TOTAL CUT OF I8 OR I9 PER CENT SINCE LAST YEARS ELECTION MR STANTON ALSO PROPOSED A RESOLUTION WHICH WAS ADOPTED BY HIS VOTE AND THAT OF MR LA RUE ANNOUNCING THE INTENTION OF THE BOARD TO REDUCE THE RATES ON COMMODITIES IN GENERAL 25 PER CENT AND WORK ON SUCH A REVISED SCHEDULE HAS BEEN BEGUN OPINIONS DIFFER AS TO THE MEANING OF THIS CHANGE OF ATTITUDE AS THE RAILROAD HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE WORDING OF THE STANTON RESOLUTION TO DECLARE ITS DETERMINATION TO CONTEST THE PROPOSED REDUCTIONS IN THE COURTS SOME ASSERT THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN ANY INTENTION OF MAKING REDUCTIONS THAT COULD BE ENFORCED WHILE OTHERS HOLD THAT THE COMMISSION HAS ACTED IN GOOD FAITH HOWEVER THIS MAY BE THE CURIOUS FACT REMAINS THAT A BODY CREATED SIXTEEN YEARS AGO FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF CURBING A SINGLE RAILROAD COR PORATION WITH A STRONG HAND WAS FOUND TO BE UNIFORMLY WITHOUT A BREAK DURING ALL THAT PERIOD ITS APOLOGIST AND DEFENDER NOT A SINGLE MAJORITY REPORT HAS EVER ISSUED FROM THE OFFICE OF THE RAILROAD COM MISSION OF A NATURE UNSATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY THE COMMISSION WAS ESTABLISHED TO CONTROL UNTIL SEPTEMBER OF THE PRESENT YEAR THE NET RESULT OF THE POPULAR AGITATION FOR THE NEW CONSTITUTION IN I879 AND OF THE VARIOUS ANTIMONOPOLY AGITATIONS SINCE HAD BEEN THE CREATION OF A NEW SOUTHERN PACIFIC LITERARY BUREAU MAINTAINED AT PUBLIC EXPENSE AND NOBODY EXPECTS THE FUTURE HISTORY OF THE COMMISSION TO DIFFER FROM ITS PAST THE MOST SANGUINE BELIEVERS IN THE SINCERITY OF THE PRESENT COMMISSIONERS DO NOT REGARD THE POSITION THEY HAVE JUST ASSUMED AS ANYTHING BUT AN EXCEPTIONAL ABERRATION IF IT SHALL TURN OUT THAT THE COMPANY HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE MAJORITY OF THE PRESENT BOARD IT IS UNIVERSALLY BELIEVED THAT IT WILL MAKE NO SUCH SLIPS WITH REGARD TO THEIR SUCCESSORS IT MAY BE THAT IN THIS DIVERGENCE BETWEEN OFFICIAL CONDUCT AND POPULAR EXPECTATIONS THE COMMISSIONERS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE RIGHT ALL I AM CONCERNED TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT A SYSTEM OF 476CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION GOVERNMENT UNDER WHICH THE PEOPLE FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO SECURE THE EXECUTION OF THEIR WISHES WHETHER RIGHT OR WRONG EXCEPT AT RARE INTERVALS CANNOT WITH STRICT ACCURACY BE CALLED DEMOCRATIC THE VALUE OF THIS ILLUSTRATION LIES IN THE FACT THAT IT IS OF GENERAL APPLICA TION IN EVERY STATE AND CITY AS WELL AS IN THE NATION OFFICERS ARE ELECTED FOR FIXED TERMS AND THE VOTERS HAVE NO FURTHER CONTROL OF THEM OR THEIR ACTIONS THE THEORY IS THAT RESPONSIBILITY IS SECURED BY THE FACT THAT THE OFFICIALS MUST COME BEFORE THE PEOPLE FOR REELECTION AT THE ENDS OF THEIR TERMS BUT IT WOULD BE EASY TO MULTIPLY INSTANCES OF THE IMPOTENCE OF THIS FORM OF REGULATION TO RECUR TO THE ILLUSTRATION CHOSEN AS THE SUBJECT OF THIS PAPER ONLY ONE RAILROAD COMMISSIONER IN CALIFORNIA HAS EVER BEEN REELECTED AND HIS SECOND ELECTION OCCURRED IN THE MIDDLE OF A PERIOD OF PROFOUND DISCOURAGEMENT AND APATHY AND IN A DISTRICT IN WHICH HIS PARTY HAD NORMALLY AN IMMENSE MAJORITY WHICH WAS STILL FURTHER STRENGTHENED BY A TIDAL WAVE IN THE STATE YET THE CERTAINTY OF POLITICAL EXTINCTION AT THE END OF FOUR YEARS HAS HAD NO DETERRENT EFFECT UPON OFFICIALS WITH VIEWS OPPOSED TO THOSE OF THE PUBLIC THE ONLY THING THAT CAN INSURE THE RULE OF THE MAJORITY IS CONTINU OUS RESPONSIBILITY THE PRESIDENT CAN DEPEND UPON HAVING HIS FINANCIAL POLICY CARRIED OUT BY THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY BECAUSE IF THE SECRETARY SHOULD ATTEMPT TO SET UP HIS OWN VIEWS AGAINST THOSE OF HIS CHIEF HE COULD BE INSTANTLY REMOVED IF THE RAILROAD COM MISSIONERS OF CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF BEING ELECTED FOR FOUR YEARS HAD BEEN APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO HOLD OFFICE DURING THE PLEASURE OF THE APPOINTING POWER THEIR POLICY COULD HAVE BEEN KEPT IN HARMONY WITH THAT OF THE GOVERNOR IF THE GOVERNOR HAD BEEN SUBJECT TO REMOVAL BY THE LEGISLATURE HE AND ALL HIS SUBORDINATES WOULD HAVE HAD TO BE PREPARED AT ANY TIME TO MEET LEGISLATIVE CRITICISM IF FINALLY EVERY MEMBER OF THE LEGISLATURE HAD HELD HIS SEAT AT THE PLEASURE OF HIS CONSTITUENTS BEFORE WHOM HE WOULD HAVE TO JUSTIFY HIS ACTIONS ON DEMAND UPON PAIN OF IMMEDIATE RECALL THE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE EXERCISED A CONTINUOUS AND EFFECTIVE CONTROL OVER EVERY BRANCH OF THE GOVERNMENT IF MISTAKES HAD BEEN COMMITTED THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN THE PEOPLES MISTAKES AND WOULD HAVE HAD AN EDUCATING VALUE WHICH COULD NOT ATTACH TO THE FAULTS OF IRRESPONSIBLE OFFICIALS DEMOCRACY HAS MANY FAULTS OF ITS OWN TO ANSWER FOR BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED WITH THE MISCONDUCT OF OFFICIALS IN AMERICA IT IS PRE CISELY BECAUSE OUR SYSTEM OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT DEMOCRATIC THAT THE PARTICULAR EVILS THAT ARE THE FAVORITE SUBJECTS FOR CRITICISM HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXIST S E MOTIWRL SAN FRANCISCO 477 II7

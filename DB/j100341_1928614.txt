slope or annual decrease of this line is I5I points the monthly decrease is O I26 points INDICES OF SEASONAL VARIATION An examination of the chart of the actual data se6 the op posite page led to the conclusion that there was no systematic movement within the year Hence indices of seasonal variation were not computed SOURCE AND NATURE OF DATA i Preliminary Study of Annual Prices of Railroad Common Stocks Our study of railroad stock prices was limited to securities traded in on the New York Stock Exchange for the reason that the volume of sales on the other exchanges of the United States during this period was comparatively small and the stocks then listed were on the whole of minor importance Moreover the monthly prices of securities sold on the New York Stock Ex change may be found summarized in tables published annually by the Commercial and Financial Chronicle and reprinted in the Financial Review while quotations for other exchanges are nowhere conveniently gathered together An examination of the tables given in the Financial Review showed that for the period i8668o there were nineteen sets of substantially complete monthly high and low quotations for railroad common stocks It was necessary however to reject two stocks for the reason that large stock dinvdends caused sud den and decided breaks in their quotations These two securities were Chicago  Alton and Chicago Burlington  Quincy It is true that many of these nineteen railroads declared stock dividends during the period i8668o Had the stocks of all such roads been rejected the list remaining would have been so small as to make the construction of an index impracticable Except for the two stocks excluded however stock dividends did not cause sudden breaks in quotations2 1 Chicago  Alton declared a 33 per cent stock dividend in February I870 causing a fall in quotations from 143 in January of that year to io08 in February Chicago Burlington  Quincy paid numerous large stock dividends during I86669 and a 20 per cent stock dividend in May i88o Prices fell from I50 in August I867 to 124 in September I867 and from I494 in April i88o to II32 in May i88o 2 One exception to this statement must be noted The Chicago Rock Island  Pacific reorganized in June i88o and in that reorganization doubled its capital stock In anticipation of this stock dividend prices rose from I47 in Decenmber I879 to 204 in June i88o Immediately after the re organization took place prices fell to iooy However it was decided that since the list of stocks available for the index was not large and since quo tations were homogeneous for fourteen out of the fifteen years of the period 33 JThe omission of the two roads just named reduced our list from nineteen to seventeen In eleven of these seventeen cases prices were comparable throughout in six cases reorganizations took place and it was necessary to multiply by a factor which would make the earlier prices comparable with those of the later period As the first step in this study there were secured for each of the seventeen continuous series just mentioned i the highest quotation for each year 2 the lowest quotation for each year and 3 the mean between these two extremes Then these three sets of figures were reduced to relatives using for each stock the average of its annual means i8668o as the base2 These relatives are presented in Chart N The medians of the relative prices of the seventeen stocks were employed to construct a first approximation to an index Medians were used rather than arithmetic or geometric means in order that stocks having unusually high or unusually low prices might not distort the index Three sets of annual index numbers were constructed based upon i the medians of the annual highs 2 the medians of the annual lows and 3 the medians of the means between the annual highs and lows It is scarcely necessary to point out that an index such as this based simply upon the extreme quotations for each year is open to a considerable margin of error and cannot be expected to show the movements of the series in question in anything more than a general way It is hard to say for example whether there was a fall or a rise in I870 as compared with I869 the medians of the highs show a drop from 125 to II4 while the medians of the lows show a rise from 96 to I00 On the other hand the preliminary index does give a good general picture of the course of railroad common stock prices during the period The increase from i866 to i868 the gradual decline during I86973 the sharp fall in the panic year I873 the continued recession during I87477 and the rapid rise of I87880 are all clearly shown Chart M3 The price movements of the individual stocks were then com pared with this preliminary index in order to discover which series were most nearly representative of the general movements in railroad common stock prices and which series displayed covered Chicago Rock Island  Pacific should be included for the period I86679 and that suitable adjustments should be made in the year i88o The method by which these adjustments were made will later be described These factors were obtained as follows New York Central with New York Cenztral s Hudson River The quota tions overlapped for November I869 and were i8o8 and 9I5 respectively Hence the quotations for New York Central were multiplied by 915  506 i8o8 per cent Pittsburg Fort Wayne  Chicago with Pittsbutrg Fort Wayne  Chicago guaranteed The quotations overlapped for August I869 and were I529 and 868 respectively Hence the quotations for Pittsburg Fort Wayne  868 Chicago were multiplied by  567 per cent I529 Michigan Southern  Northern Indiana with Lake Shore  Michigan Southern Here the figures did not overlap The last quotation for the former stock was II3I for June I869 and the first quotation for the latter was 1072 for August I869 For the other sixteen stocks prices in August 1869 averaged 993 per cent of prices in June 1869 this figure was secured by expressing the price of each stock in August 1869 as a percentage of its price in June 1869 and then averaging the sixteen percentages It was therefore assumed that had Michigan Southern a Nforthsern Indianal been quoted in August 1869 its price would have been 993 per cent of its price in June 1869 or 993 per cent of 1131  1123 The quotations for Michigan Southern aNorthern Indiana were multiplied by 1072  955 per cent Cleveland Columbus e 6incinznati with Cleveland Columbus Cinqcinnati e Indiana This adjustment was similar to that just described The last quotation for the former stock was Io5o in April I868 and the first quota tion for the latter was 9I2 in June I868 For the other sixteen stocks prices in June I868 averaged I067 per cent of prices in April I868 It was there fore assumed that had Cleveland Colusmbus e Cincinnati been quoted in June I868 its price would have been 1067 per cent of its price in April 1868 or 1067 per cent of Io5o  I120 Hence the quotations for Cleveland Columbus a Cincinnati were multiplied by 9 814 per cent  34 peculiar movements of their own Two tests were applied as follows i A graphical test The preliminary index and each

were I45  147 in Sep tember I872 The mean price for the month was in each case I46 There fore no adjustment was considered necessary 2 The annual high and low quotations were obtained from the convenient summary of the American Almanaac 1882 pp 98 99 and from the tables of the Financial Review For Chicago Rock Island  Pacific quotations subsequent to the reorganization of June I880 were not used in determining the extreme prices for I88o In determining the high figure for Chicago r Northwestern in the year 1872 the exceptionally high prices reached during the corner of November 2026 have been disregarded During that week quotations reached 230 The high for the rest of the year is 90 3Compare the following from American Railways as Investments pp 49 5o by Carl Snyder From 1870 to I873 there was a general fall in stock prices culminating in the famous panic This was followed by four years of general depression Actually stocks touched a much lower level in I877 than in I873   From 1878 to T88I prices rose rapidly 4In the actual process of ranking the high and low annual prices were considered as well as the mean prices To avoid confusion in presentation however the mean prices

Chicago Milwaukee  St Paul io Ohio  Mississippi io Chicago  Northwestern P represents the preliminary index of railroad common stock prices based upon the medians of the annual relative prices 3 of the stocks numbered i to I7 above prices were grouped about the medians The description of this test will be divided into three parts as follows a determina tion of average position of annual relative high prices as com pared with their medians b determination of average position of annual relative low prices as compared with their medians c ranking of the stocks on the basis of the results of the two preceding steps a In each year the stock having the central or median relative price was given a grade of o the two stocks whose rela tive pri ces were immediately adjacent to the median were given a grade of I the two stocks whose relative prices fell second from the median on either side were given a grade of 2 This process was continued until the two stocks having the extreme prices for the year were reached these were given a grade of 8 Finally an average grade was secured for each of the seventeen stocks by summing its annual grades i8668o and dividing by fifteen b The method applied to the relative low prices was exactly the same as that used for the relative high prices which is de scribed in the preceding paragraph c For each stock two average scores had been obtained a one based upon the annual relative high prices and b the other upon the annual relative low prices The means of these two average scores were taken and served as a basis for our statistical ranking It was evident that those stocks whose price movements were most nearly like the general price movement and whose relative prices tended for that reason to lie near the medians would have comparatively low average scores while those stocks whose price movements were erratic or were de cidedly different from the general movement and whose rela tive prices therefore did not tend to lie near the medians would have comparatively high average scores Hence the stock hav ing the lowest average score was ranked i the stock with the next lowest average score was ranked 2 and so on The results of the two tests are presented in the table on page 22 It will be noted that the conclusions reached by the two independent methods show a remarkably close agreement On the basis of the results presented in this table two groups of stocks were formed designated as Group I and Group II respectively Group I is composed of ten stocks whose graphs show a reasonably close correspondence with that of the prelimi nary index Chart N and whose relative prices on the whole tend to lie near the medians for Group I the average deviation of the relative prices from the medians ranged from 20 to 4I Group II is composed of seven 4 stocks which displayed erratic 1 For Union Pacific average for i87080  I00 for Ohio  Mississippi average for I86780  I00 2 For a description of the adjustments made for this

data with chart of preliminary index movements quite dissimilar to the general tendency For Group II the average deviation of the relative prices from the medians ranged from 47 to 63 It was desirable that the final index should give a clearcut picture of the general tendencies in railroad common stock quotations during the period under consideration It seemed best therefore to discard the stocks of Group II for the fluctua tions in the prices of each of these securities were due primarily to special circumstances connected with the particular railroad in question and not to those influences which brought about the general movements in railroad stocks Pittsburg Fort Wayne  Chicago and Cleveland  Pittsburg were guaranteed by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company in I872 thereafter these securi ties ceased to be speculative in character The earnings of Panama decreased decidedly after the completion of the Union clear however from an examination of the graphs that the movement of the quotations of these two stocks were altogether different from the general tendency 1 In computing the price for Chicago  Northwestern for November I872 the exceptionally high prices reached during the corner of November 2026 were disregarded During this week quotations reached 230 the range for the rest of the month was 774 to 864 2 In this connection the conclusions stated by Wesley C Mitchell in his article A Critique of Index Numbers of the Prices of Stocks Journal of Political Economy July I9I6 pp 69I 692 are pertinent The choice of methods in making an index number of stocks should be guided by the specific purpose in view It follows that the index number that is best for any purpose depends upon the specific phase of price fluctuations which that purpose requires to be measured   But by way of conclusion we may point out what fluctuations in the prices of stocks can be measured with the narrowest margin of error and argue that the index number which best represents these most measurable fluctuations is the best generalpurpose  series the index number to be recommended for use by the general reader and by the specialist also when his particular aim does not definitely de mand some differently constructed series in spite of its inferior accuracy Along this line a confident opinion can be given Geometric means of the ratios of change in quotations within brief periods such as from one year to the next have been shown to be the most accurate measures of fluctuations in the prices of stocks   For measuring fluctuations covering longer periods of time geometric means are again the most representative averages i36 J Pacific and the taking off of steamships on the Pacific lines correspondingly there was an enormous drop in the quoted prices of Panama Central of New Jersey and Hannibal  St Joseph experienced financial difficulties during the later years of the period the former road in fact passed into the hands of a receiver The series of manipulations to which Erie was sub jected are so well known as scarcely to require narration 2 Construction of Monthly Index of the Prices of Railroad Common Stocks Monthly prices were secured for each of the ten stocks of Group I by taking the means between the monthly high and low quotations printed in the Financial Review It was then neces sary to decide whether the median the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean should be employed to combine these monthly mean prices into an index For three reasons it was decided not to employ the median i While it is true that this form of average has the distinct property of not being liable to distortion as are the geometric and arithmetic means by exceptionally large or exceptionally small items advantage had already been taken of this virtue in the preliminary study just described and stocks whose annual relative prices showed wide variations from the medians had been rejected 2 Where index numbers are based upon medians an error is introduced when the base is shifted 3 The number of items to be averaged is small and hence the medians are erratic in their behavior The choice was consequently narrowed to the geometric vs the arithmetic mean Geometric means had two advantages over arithmetic means i Arithmetic means of relative prices cannot be shifted readily from one base period to another in the case of geometric means this may be accomplished by simple division 2 While the geometric mean is inferior to the arith metic as a measure of changes in the amount of money that stocks or commodities cost the former average is a perfect measure of the average percentage of change between any two given dates In the present case we were primarily interested in the relative changes in prices Hence the geometric mean was considered the better for our purpose2 There remains to be described only the final step in the com putation of the index Geometric means were taken of the monthly prices3 of the ten stocks of Group I Then those geo metric means were reduced to relatives with their arithmetic average i8668o as Ioo The resulting series constituted our final monthly index numbers of railroad common stock prices These index numbers are presented graphically in Chart 4A at the top of p 32 and the actual data are printed in the first table on p 33 Throughout the period there are occasional missing quotations The method of interpolation was uniform and a single example will serve to illustrate it In January i867 and February I867 there were no figures for Morris  Essex The geometric averages of prices of the other nine stocks for those two months and for the preceding month were Dec I866 Jan I867 Feb I867 907 827 8I0 For the geometric means of the nine stocks then prices in January I867 were 7or 912 per cent of prices in December I 866 and prices in February were 907or 892 per cent of prices of December I866 The mean price of Morris r Essex in December I866 was 8oo its interpolated prices for January I867 and February I867 were secured by assuming that had Morris r Essex been traded in during those months its quotations would have decreased in the same ratio as did the geometric means of the prices of the other nine stocks its interpolated figure for January I867 then was 912 per cent of 8oo or 730 for February I867 892 per cent of 80o or 7I4 It has previously been pointed oult that a stock dividend of Ioo per cent declared by the Chicago Rock Island e Pacific in June I880 greatly dis turbed its quotations during that year Prices rose from I47 in December I879 to 204 in June I88o and immediately after the dividend fell to Iooa This stock was therefore dropped from the index during I88o the final year of the period and interpolated values were secured for those twelve months in the manner explained aboveIt will be observed that the index was computed by first taking geometric means of the prices and then reducing these means to relative numbers If instead the monthly prices had first been reduced to relatives and geometric means had then been taken our resulting index numbers would have shown precisely the same relative fluctuations as did those obtained by the process actually employed 3 The Prices of Railroad Preferred Stocks It is possible to secure fairly complete monthly quotations i8668o for the preferred stocks of six railroads These are Chicago  Alton Erie Chicago  Northwestern Hannibal  St Joseph Chicago Milwaukee  St Paul Ohio  Mississippi For the common and preferred stocks of each of these roads yearly prices were computed by taking the means of the highest and the lowest annual quotations From these yearly prices annual relatives were computed with i8668o as the base period for Ohio  Mississippi I86780 Chart P shows that for the six railroads having preferred stocks quoted on the New York Stock Exchange for all or nearly all of the period I8668o the prices of each preferred stock fluctuated in remarkably close agreement with those of I For Ohio

OF ADMINISTRATION GARNISHMENT AND TAXATION WHILE physical power is recognized as the foundation of jurisdiction and many important rules of law are based on this principle as for example the rules that service by publication does not warrant a personal judgment against a nonresident2 and power of control over the res constitutes sufficient basis for jurisdiction in rem3 and without such control of the res a judg ment in rem is not valid4 still this fundamental principle has not always been kept clearly in mind and the failure to do so has produced a complex and confused state of the law where simplicity only need exist This is especially true of the law as respects jurisdiction over debts Control over the res will give jurisdiction in rem though its owner is an absent nonresident and not served personally with process Thus jurisdiction in rem is exercised 1 In McDonald v Mabee 243 U S 90 9I I9I7 where it is held a personal judg ment rendered upon service by publication is void Holmes J says The founda tion of jurisdiction is physical power although in civilized times it is not necessary to maintain that power throughout proceedings properly begun and although submission to the jurisdiction by appearance may take the place of service upon the person No doubt there may be some extension of the means of acquiring jurisdiction beyond service or appearance but the foundation should be borne in mind 2 Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 714 i877 McDonald v Mabee 243 U S 90 I9I7 3 27 HARv L REv I07 4 The Belgenland II4 U S 355 i885 27 HARV L REV I07 Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 714 i877 Union Refrigerator Transit Co v KentuckyIgg U S I94 I905906 HARVARD LAW REVIEW by admiralty courts over vessels5 and by equity courts through the aid of statutes over land situated within the boundary of their sovereign without regard to jurisdiction over the persons having interests therein In other words where the state has power of control over the res it has not only the power which every state unrestricted by constitutional inhibitions has to destroy the rights powers and immunities as respects that res of an owner over whose person it has no jurisdiction but such power when exercised in accordance with the accepted principles of jurisdiction in rem is respected in other states on commonlaw principles and is not objectionable as violating any constitutional guaranty of the owner7 While power of control is the foundation upon which juris diction rests it is not incumbent upon courts to take jurisdiction in every instance where such power exists Policy or restrictions of the federal constitution may stand in the way Thus for prac tical reasons ancillary administration would not be granted in a state where property of the decedent was merely in transit through that state though such state would have power to grant such administration Or it may be that due process of law requires the courts of a state where property is located to refuse jurisdic tion unless there has been notice by publication to the absent non resident owner8 Or it may be that the requirement of due process of law would not be met by a state levying a tax upon property merely in transit through the state though the state would have power to levy such tax except for the constitutional prohibition9 Jurisdiction over tangible property is dependent upon the phys ical presence of the property for it is at such place that the power of control exists But the important thing to observe is that it is the power of control that is the basis of jurisdiction and not location and it is this power of control which gives whatever significance there is to the legal concept  situs 10 5 The Belgenland II4 U S 355 i885 6 Arndt v Griggs I34 U S 316 i890 7 Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 7I4 i877 Arndt v Griggs

actual loca tion as for example the place where the property will be considered as having itsJURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 907 It is evident that the law for purposes of jurisdiction is not inter ested in the spatial quality of property that is the fact that the property has extension or occupies space except in so far as that quality affords the state the power of control over it If the loca tion or situs of tangible property gave no power of control or if control could be exercised independently of situs then we should never have situs  mentioned in connection with jurisdiction over property Where the property is tangible in form power of control and location coincide1 Even here it is evident that it is power of control and not loca tion that is the basis of jurisdiction For the mere fact that the property is within the territory during the litigation is not enough control must be taken at the time litigation is begun12 Where the property is intangible however this element of loca tion is absent but power of control may still exist and constitute the basis of jurisdiction The failure to observe that it is this element of control and not the quality of occupying space that gives situss its significance has led to the greatest confusion in the decisions relating to jurisdiction over intangible property in the form of debts A variety of views mostly untenable has developed as a result of the attempt to use situs in the sense of location as applicable to debts One view locates it by means of the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam at the creditors domicil13 another at the debtors domicil14 a third considering it a light and nimble thing finds that it may be located by legislative fiat at the debtors domicil 15 a fourth considers a debt since it is intan gible as being without situs 6 a fifth as having its situs deter mined in each case by the purpose involved7 a sixth that it has situs for legal purposes when such place differs from its actual location is to intro duce fiction without any justifiable excuse This only serves to conceal truth and lead to confusion Hays v Pacific Mail Steamship Co I7 How U S 596 i854 is an example of a case where situs is used in a fictional sense and there is ex hibited an insufficient grasp of the principles of jurisdiction 11 Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 7I4 i877 12 Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 7I4 i877 13 State Tax on ForeignHeld

a debt is wherever the debtor can be found20 Bearing in mind this elemental fact that physical power is essen tial to jurisdiction over property and considering situs as the place where power of control can be exercised let us in the light of the jurisdiction that is exercised over tangible property consider the problems of jurisdiction over debts for the purpose of administra tion garnishment and taxation I JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS FOR PURPOSES OF ADMINISTRATION A debtor may be sued wherever process may be served upon him This fact justifies the decisions which allow an administra tor to sue a foreign debtor who comes within the jurisdiction in which the administrator is permitted to sue Power to collect the debt exists there as there is power of control over the debtor If an administrator wishes to recover property or debts outside the state he must be granted ancillary administrative power2 Ancillary administration will be granted by the courts of a state where the tangible property of a nonresident decedent is located Power of control over the property both demands and justifies this procedure In like manner ancillary administration will be granted by the courts of a state where a debtor of a nonresident decedent is domi ciled Power of control over the debtor is required to give the necessary power of control over the debt As no administration would be granted by the courts of a state through which a chattel is in transit so no administration will be granted where a debtor is present within the state only temporarily The reason for the refusal to take jurisdiction in such cases is not that there is a lack of power to exercise jurisdiction but for the 18 MINOR CONFLICT OF LAWS  I2I 19 Bacon v Hooker I77 Mass 335 337 58 N E I078 i0oi

42JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 909 practical reason that the administrator cannot be sure of reducing his claim to possession in that state22 Where the property is permanently located or where the debtor has his domicil there the court has jurisdiction all the time and if administration is granted the administrator can be practically certain of making use of the powers granted him II JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS FOR PURPOSES OF GARNISHM NT We have seen that power of control over the debtor is the founda tion of jurisdiction over debts for purposes of administration As tangible property must have a more or less permanent situs for purposes of administration so in case of a debt sufficiently per manent situs is found where the debtor is domiciled It is at such place that power of control of a necessary duration exists Tangible property may be attached in any state where it lies23 So the possessor of a chattel may be garnisheed in any state where he holds the chattel This is true though the goods happen to be merely in transit through the state24 If the goods have not come into the state or have passed through the possessor is not subject to garnishment25 The temporary physical presence of the tangi ble chattel affords the state power of control over it of a duration sufficient for the purpose of garnishment and as jurisdiction over the debtor affords the state a similar power of control over the debt on principle we should expect to find in that case also tempor ary jurisdiction over the debtor sufficient for garnishment proceed ings And so we do actually find it It has been so held in a series of comparatively recent cases by the United States Supreme Court26 Jurisdiction in these cases has been placed upon the ground that 22 27 HARV L REV II4 II5 Saunders vWeston 74 Me

over the person of the garnishee confers jurisdiction on the courts of the State where the writ issues27 While these decisions of the United States Supreme Court hold ing that a judgment obtained in a court having jurisdiction over the person of the garnishee only are good against the defendant a nonresident debtorcreditor upon whom service was not obtained and are entitled to full faith and credit in the other states of the Union these holdings do not require the courts of the state in which garnishment proceedings against a nonresident defendant are originally brought to take jurisdiction They have neverthe less settled the law in favor of taking jurisdiction in such cases Where statutes authorize such proceedings there is no reason for the courts adopting a hostile attitude and interpreting them as not intending such operation or refusing to take jurisdiction in such case28 Though the law is settled in harmony with the doctrine of Harris v Balk strong objections have been urged against it by Professor Joseph H Beale one of Americas ablest writers on the Conflict of Laws29 These objections must now be examined There are several of them One that it is a departure from the custom of London as to Foreign Attachment upon which our statutory process of foreign attachment or garnishment is based another that it loses sight of the original conception of garnishment as a proceeding in rem and substitutes for it the conception of garnishment as a transitory personal action against the garnishee another that a debtor can not be discharged of his debts to foreign creditors in a garnishment proceeding since he cannot in an insolvency proceeding and other objections are that it is unjust both to the garnishee and to the principal defendants Undoubtedly our practice in garnishment proceedings has gone beyond the custom of London as to Foreign Attachment in that our law does not require the garnishee to be a resident of or the debt payable in the jurisdiction where the proceeding is begun as does the custom of London The custom does however have this 27 Harris v Balk i98 U S 2I5 222 I905 28 See cases collected in i9 L R A 577 67 L R A 209 3 L

defendant to be appropriated to the payment of debts due the plaintiff without personal service upon the defendant But surely it is not seriously contended that our practice as to garnishment is unwarranted because our legislatures have had the temerity to depart from the custom of London as it existed perhaps three centuries ago and it cannot be concluded that these statutes have departed from the custom without observing the end such departure sought to accomplish  the application of valuable assets of the debtor which could not otherwise be reached to the payment of his debts It is very likely these statutes were framed with the deliberate purpose of covering debts wherever payable and of catching the garnishee whether a resident or not Professor Beale nowhere urges that the custom of London goes too far In fact he urges that the fault in our practice lies in its departure from the custom but his contention stated later herein that the court of the debtors domicil has no power to reach the debt due the foreign debtorcreditor without jurisdiction over his person would had it been heeded have prevented the custom from ever arising There never could have been garnishment of debts in such case without personal service upon the defendant the foreign debtorcreditor Furthermore Professor Beales assertion that to allow an action against the garnishee wherever found involves an abandonment of the idea of the action as one in rem and a treatment of it as a transitory personal action against the garnishee is based upon the assumption that the debt cannot have a situs with the debtor If the situs of the debt is wherever you can get service upon the debtor garnishee because that is where you can exercise control over the debt then there exists in that place the basis for jurisdic tion in rem Professor Beale admits as every thoughtful lawyer must admit that power of control over the debt gives jurisdiction and jurisdiction in rem too but he would say you get no power 31 Under these proceedings custom of London without personal service upon the defendant debts due the defendant which were not subjects that could be reached by a fi fa at law were subject to his plaintiffs claim Haber v Nassits I2 Fla 589 609 i869 Our proceedings by attachment against absent and absconding debtors are borrowed from what is called a foreign attachment under the custom of London Welsh v Blackwell I4 N J L 2 Green 344 346 i8349I2 HARVARD LAW REVIEW of control over the debt by having jurisdiction over the debtor alone He says The true doctrine would seem to be that a debt has in fact no situs anywhere not merely because it is intangible but because as a mere forced relation between the parties it has no real existence anywhere Like other such relations it may of course be controlled by the law or by the courts as instruments of the law but the control must be obtained by making use of the relation In order to control the relation the court must have the power to control both parties to it Any court which has both debtor and creditor may compel a release from the credi tor and an assignment of the action of the creditor In other words if a debt is to be legally assigned or discharged it requires the action of both parties and especially the creditor and the court which has to apply such a process must do so through its control over both parties  32 We agree in part with Professor Beale in this statement we admit that a debt has no existence anywhere that it consists of a relation between debtor and creditor and that this relation is sub ject to control by the courts But we take issue with him as to the place where the courts may exercise that control for purposes of garnishment Ownership of tangible property consists of a rela tionship33 perhaps somewhat different from the relationship between creditor and debtor because of the difference in the elements related In the case of tangible property the direct relationship between the owner and the thing is without significance because the res has no rights powers privileges or immunities which it may exercise against the owner or any will to assert them The relationship is of importance only as it affects some third person or persons In the case of a debt the relationship between the creditor and debtor has two aspects of significance for the law one the direct rela tionship between the creditor and the debtor i e the right in per sonam which the creditor has against the debtor and the correla tive duty of the debtor to the creditor and the other its relation ship to third persons i e to the world In this latter aspect the law has come to treat this right of the creditor as it relates to third persons as a property right The debt is an asset of the creditor in the same way in which any tangible property he owns is an asset In garnishment proceedings we are dealing with the rights of 32 27 HARV L REV I07 II5i6 33 AMES LECTURE ON LEGAL HISTORY 2I2JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 9I3 a third person to treat the debt due a creditor as assets and to apply it as he would assets of a tangible sort to the payment of debts due him In garnishment proceedings it is submitted that the doctrine of our courts is sound in considering jurisdiction over the debtor garnishee alone as sufficient basis of jurisdiction in rem over the debt The analogy of the attachment and garnishment of chattels warrants this conclusion We have seen that tangible property may be attached in any state where it lies and that the possessor of a chattel may be gar nisheed in any state regardless of the fact that the owner resides outside the state and is not served with process Here is a basis for jurisdiction in rem or rather quasi in rem and the courts have found no difficulty in severing the relationship of the owner to the property without having the owner before it and such decisions have been held not to violate any constitutional guaranty34 Jurisdiction over the debtor gives as complete control over the debt as the physical presence of a piece of tangible property gives the court power of control over it The court having exclusive jurisdiction over the debtor has power to appropriate the debt in the same way that a court having jurisdiction over tangible chattels may appropriate them to the payment of the debtors debts In either case the restrictions on the courts power to do as it pleases with the chattel or debt do not arise from a lack of control but are imposed by the constitution or out of considerations of policy Professor Beale contends that since a debtor cannot be dis charged of debts which he owes to foreign creditors in an insolvency proceeding had at his domicil a debtor cannot have a debt which he owes to a foreign creditor made the subject matter of a garnish ment proceeding But this is a non sequitur for two reasons First the two proceedings are not alike in all particulars and secondly if they were it does not necessarily follow that garnishment should be treated as insolvency is treated rather than the reverse While the power of control over the debtor is the same in each proceeding they differ so far in other particulars that it may be argued they should be treated differently In the case of a dis charge in insolvency we deal directly with the contract right between 34 Cooper v Reynolds io Wall U S 308 i870 approved in Pennoyer v Neff supra Statutes authorizing attachment of the goods of a foreign owner on notice by publication exist in most of the states and their validity has not been questioned9I4 HARVARD LAW REVIEW the debtor and creditor and not as a piece of property or assets of the creditor which a third person comes against while in attachment or garnishment of a debt we are treating the creditors right as a piece of property the same as tangible property and are seeking to apply it to the payment of the debtors debts to a third person There may be warrant for establishing a rule of law as is done in attachment and garnishment cases which seeks to prevent debtors with property from escaping the payment of just debts that could not be urged for a rule of law as is the case in insolvency proceed ings that aided a debtor in embarrassed circumstances to escape the payment of his debt to a creditor A state insolvency law dis charging debts owing to foreign creditors might be regarded as unconstitutional on the ground of an implied restriction on the power to pass insolvent laws reserved to the States Denny v Bennett i28 U S 489 498 possibly on the ground that the dis charge would impair the obligation of contracts with persons not within the jurisdiction Cook v Moffat 5 How U S 295 308 possibly by reason of the Fourteenth Amendment Pennoyer v Neff 95 U S 714 possibly upon some vaguer ground35 But to take the view of the earlier United States Supreme Court cases that a contract made and to be performed in the state of the debtors domicil could not be discharged in an insolvency proceeding by the courts of that state as against a foreign creditor on the ground that when  the States pass beyond their own limits and the rights of their own citizens and act upon the rights of citizens of other States there arises a conflict of sovereign power and a collision with the judicial powers granted to the United States which renders the exercise of such a power incompatible with the rights of other States and with the Constitution of the United States36 would make all jurisdiction in rem unconstitutional It would make statutes authorizing attachment or garnishment of chattels within a state for the purpose of applying them to the payment of a foreign debtors debt as well as the doctrine of Harris v Balk unconsti tutional For in jurisdiction in rem and quasi in rem states pass beyond their own limits and determine the rights of citizens of other states 5 Quoted from Phoenix National Bank v Batcheller I5I Mass 589 592 24 N E 9I7 9i8 i890 36 This was the ground of decision in Ogden v Saunders I2 Wheat U S 213 218 i827 as sanctioned and stated in Baldwin v Hale i Wall U S 223 23I i863JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 9I5 Furthermore even if it were admitted that insolvency and garnishment proceedings are wholly analogous there would seem to be at least as much basis for urging that insolvency proceedings should affect the rights of the absent nonresident creditor as pro ceedings in garnishment do as for urging the reverse Considera tion of the relative antiquity of the two doctrines37 and of power of control over the debtor as giving control over the debt as the determining factors sanction this view It will be observed too in this connection that under the English law a discharge of a debt in insolvency or bankruptcy proceedings had at the debtors domicil where that is the place of contracting and performing will operate as a discharge everywhere and that this English rule was early followed in this country38 and departed from out of deference to the opinion of the United States Supreme Court upon the ground that a judgment by a state court holding that a discharge of a debt in insolvency proceedings within the state would bar an action by a foreign creditor would be reviewable by the United States Supreme Court on the ground that it violated some constitutional guaranty of the creditor39 Westlake suggests that a discharge in bankruptcy in the bankrupts state would if we had a perfect cosmopolitan system of bankruptcy bar suits in other states40 It would seem to be proper and even desirable that a discharge in insolvency in the state of the debtors domicil should operate as a discharge of all his debts including those owing to foreign creditors where the creditors were properly safeguarded and given ample opportunity to file their claims and to secure their allowance and pro rata payment Professor Beales argument that it is unjust to the garnishee debtor because he cannot be protected from suit by the defendant in a foreign jurisdiction applies with equal force to the case of a garnishee in possession of a chattel in which case Professor Beale says there is no difficulty whatever and no difference of opinion 37 As we have seen our practice as to foreign attachment is based upon the custom of London which dates back perhaps three centuries whereas the leading case holding in accord with our present doctrine as to insolvency was not decided until less than a century ago That is the case of Ogden v Saunders I2 Wheat U S I32 2i8 decided in i827 38 Scribner v Fisher 2 Gray Mass 43 i854 Felch v Bugbee 48 Me 9 i859 39 Phoenix National Bank v Batcheller I5I Mass 589 24 N E 9I7 i890 40 PRIVATE INTERNATIONAL LAW 2 ed  224 i88o9i6 HARVARD LAW REVIEW in the cases41 Of course the argument can have no weight in the United States where the garnishee is protected by the full faithandcredit clause of the federal constitution The interesting case of Ward v Boyce42 which Professor Beale cites to show that even the United States Supreme Court could not protect the garnishee against the obligation to pay the debt again is not peculiar to the garnishment of debts A comparison of the facts of that case with a parallel situation in the case of the gar nishment of chattels will make it evident that there is no injustice in that decision peculiar to our practice of garnishment of debts In Ward v Boyce the defendant garnishee by trustee process was made to pay to the plaintiff in Vermont a debt which a Ver mont court found he owed to an absent husband and he was not protected against a suit by the wife of the absent husband who proved to the satisfaction of a New York court that the defendant owed her instead of her husband If instead of owing a debt to the wife the defendant had held possession of a chattel of hers in Ver mont and had allowed it to be taken and applied in payment of the husbands debts upon the supposition that it was the husbands property will it be contended that he will be protected by reason of the Vermont proceeding from a suit by the wife in New York Frankly it is impossible to see how the doctrine of Harris v Balk will cause greater injustice to the debtor who is garnisheed than the admittedly proper doctrine of the garnishment of chattels will cause to the garnished possessor of chattels Professor Beale presents forcibly the argument that the garnish ment process subjects the nonresident principal defendant to fraudulent and doubtful claims without redress He says An owner of property may determine the situs of the property he owns and may justly be subjected to the action of the courts within whose territory his property is found The creditor however has no power to fix the personal presence of his debtor at one place or another For all the creditor can do the debtor may travel where he will It is therefore unjust to submit the creditors claim to the accident of the debtors presence in one state or another Yet according to the current doctrine if the debtor is traveling a thousand miles away from the credi tor s domicil he may there be garnished and be compelled to pay a claim 4e HARV L REV I07 II3 42 I52 N Y i9i i897 cited in 27 HARV L REV I07 I2IJURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 9I7 which is alleged to be a legal claim against the creditor To be sure if the creditor happens to have notice of the suit which can usually be obtained only by careful reading of the newspaper published where the suit is brought he has a right to defend himself but unless the claim as made in the garnishment proceeding is a very large one it will hardly pay him to travel across the country in order to meet the charge taking with him his evidence Without doing so his effort to disprove the claim however groundless it may be is practically hopeless the absen tee is always wrong just as surely in court as in the outside world He may send on his deposition but a deposition is of very little force against the actual living testimony of the plaintiff He may employ counsel but counsel is helpless without witness Garnishment therefore is practised at the present day as a safe and easy instrument of fraud It must be borne in mind that Professor Beale admits that the practice of attachment and garnishment of tangible chattels wher ever found though the owner is absent and a nonresident is sound and proper44 The only difference between attachment and gar nishment of a tangible chattel and of a debt as respects any injus tice that may be done the owner or creditor is that in the case of a tangible chattel the owner has more power to fix its situs than the creditor has to fix the personal presence of the debtor So far as the defendants chances of getting notice of suit being brought are concerned they are even greater in the case of the garnishment of a debt than in the case of the attachment of a tangible chattel for the doctrine of Harris v Balk requires the garnishee to give his creditor notice if he is to avail himself of the judgment and payment thereunder whereas no such requirement is made in a case of the attachment of tangible property Professor Beales statement that the creditor can usually get notice of the suit only by careful reading of the newspaper published where the suit is brought is therefore inaccurate So far as the hopelessness of disproving a wholly fraudulent claim the case of attachment and garnishment of tangible chattels and of debts are on a par And so far as the writer has been able to ascertain the actual instances of fraud and trumped up claims that have crept into garnishment proceedings because of the fact that the debtor may move about 43 27 HARV L REV I07 I2I22 44 In 27 HARV L REV I07 II3 he says In the case of a tangible chattel there is no difficulty whatever and no difference of opinion in the cases9i8 HARVARD LAW REVIEW freely without the creditors being able to fix his presence are rare It is believed that Professor Beales statement though skilful is exaggerated Further his statement does not touch the sound ness of the principle that the court which gets jurisdiction over the debtor has jurisdiction to apply the debt the garnishee owes the absent defendant in satisfaction of the plaintiff s claim Whether it is advisable to have statutes authorizing the proceed ing is purely a matter of policy Whether it is better policy to permit absent and absconding debtors to escape the payment of just debts than to subject the debtors to the possibility which ex perience has shown to be slight of trumped up and fraudulent claims is entirely a question of legislative policy The fact that the proceeding of garnishment against foreign debtors has been so generally established in this country would indicate which is con sidered the better policy III JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF TAXATION As power of control over tangible property and over the debtor was seen to be the foundation of jurisdiction over such property and debts for purpose of administration so power of control over tangible property and over the debtor is seen to be the foundation of jurisdiction over such property and debts for the purpose of attachment and garnishment As a more or less permanent situs of tangible property is required for purpose of administration over the property so domicil of the debtor a thing of a more than tem porary character is required for purpose of administration over the debt But as a temporary situs is sufficient for attachment and garnishment of tangible property so the temporary presence of the debtor is sufficient for the garnishment of debts For the purpose of taxation in respect to tangible property we find power of control is likewise essential to give jurisdiction be cause in the American states the theory prevails that the right of the state to exact a tax rests upon the existence of a protection service or benefit rendered as an equivalent for the tax exacted and though the state where the owner resides has control over his person yet protection service or benefit to him in respect to his property can only be rendered by the state which has that power of control over the property Where such power of controlJURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 9I9 is absent and therefore where the state has not given such protec tion the exaction of a tax is unconstitutional on the ground that it is taking property without due process of law45 Since power of control over the property is what makes pos sible protection to the property and since protection potentially at least is rendered wherever such power of control exists we should expect on principle to find the courts supporting any tax imposed by a state having power of control over the property unless the property was in the state so short a time that the pro tection rendered would make the taking of a tax arbitrary or con fiscatory under our Constitution Temporary presence is not enough46 mere transit through the state will not warrant the im position of a tax We find that a property tax may be levied upon real property both tangible and intangible and upon tangible personal property by the state where it is permanently located That is the state that has power of control over the property47 and such state is the only one that can tax it A tax imposed by the state of the owners domicil in which the property is not located is taking property without due process of law48 Protection or benefit given is also the principle that is sought to be applied in the succession tax A succession tax by the state where the property is located is universally upheld This is true 45 Union Refrigerator Transit Co v Kentucky i99 U S I94 202 I905 In that case it was said The power of taxation indispensable to the existence of every civilized government is exercised upon the assumption of an equivalent rendered to the taxpayer in the protection of his person and property or in the creation and main tenance of public convenience in which he shares such for instance as roads bridges sidewalks pavements and schools for the education of his children If the taxing power be in no position to render these services or otherwise to benefit the person or property taxed and such property be wholly within the taxing power of another State to which it may be said to

whether we consider it a tax upon the property itself or upon the privilege of transmitting it or of acquiring it or upon the transfer of it seems sound It accords with the principle of a protection benefit or privilege given as an equivalent for the tax For the state where the property is located in its ultimate analysis is the state which has the power of control over and gives force to the privilege to transmit or acquire and makes effective the transfer Of course if the tax were levied upon the privilege of receiving possession and of enjoying the property of its equivalent or receiv ing and enjoying the income thereof the state of the distributees domicil would be the one having power of control and the one mak ing effective the privilege and should therefore be the one to levy such tax50 But it is also held that a succession tax may be levied at the domicil of the decedent as respects personal property located out side the state5 And such tax has been based too upon the theory that it is for a benefit or privilege extended by the state exacting the tax It is asserted that the res taxed is the privilege of trans mitting property and for that reason the state of the domicil of the decedent which grants the privilege of transmitting the property should have jurisdiction to tax But is it not the state of the situs of the property that makes the privilege effective rather than that of the domicil of the decedent and should it not be the state to levy the tax Suppose A dies domiciled in New York State own ing land and chattels in Ohio and his heirs are domiciled in New Jersey and the sovereign states of New York and New Jersey say that this property shall or shall not go to B C and D but the state of Ohio says the exact contrary that it shall not or it shall

an effective claim to the property in Ohio except as the state of Ohio sanctions it and a claim sanctioned by the state of Ohio will be effective no matter what New York or New Jersey may have to say about it Again it is said in explanation of the practice which sustains a succession tax imposed by the state of the domicil of the decedent on foreign personal property but not on real property that it results from the fact that the law of the owners domicil is the one that is applied to regulate the devolution of personal property but not that of real property52 The fact that the law of a particular state is applied to deter mine the rights of parties ought never to be confused with the ques tion of jurisdiction That the law of the decedents domicil is applied to determine devolution to personality seems to furnish no basis of jurisdiction for that state to impose a tax There is no protection privilege or benefit extended or conferred by such state In its ultimate analysis it is the state where the property is located that controls and makes effective its devolution53 though for con venience that state may apply the rules of law existing in the state of the decedents domicil in so doing It has also been urged that by reason of the fiction mobilia sequuntur personal personal prop erty has its situs at the domicil of the owner But this is admit tedly a fiction and certainly gives no actual power of control over the property to the state of the owners domicil It is a fiction too that has been rejected in the case of a property tax upon chattels outside the state imposing the tax on the ground that such tax constitutes the taking of property without due process of law and is therefore unconstitutionalr4 It seems difficult if not impossible to find any sufficient ground

REVIEW to permit and to regulate the succession to property upon its owners decease rests upon the fact of an actual dominion over that prop erty states the true ground upon which jurisdiction to impose a succession tax must rest While in the succession tax cases there is disagreement as to which state furnished the protection or privilege there is complete agreement in both the property and succession tax cases on the more fundamental proposition that jurisdiction to tax rests in the state which furnished such protection or privilege And as we have seen that state is necessarily the one which has power of control over the property Let us now pass from the consideration of taxation upon tan gible property to a consideration of the question of which states should tax debts It is submitted that following the analogy of taxation upon tangible property and the principle that a tax is taken as an equiv alent for protection service or benefit given by the taxing power the state of the debtors domicil is the one and the only one which should exact the tax on debts Where the debts are in the form of a specialty which is held in another state and the convenient theory or fiction is adopted that an obligation represented in a mer cantile specialty shall be treated as wholly merged in that specialty then the tax should be levied only where the specialty is located In spite of principle and weighty authority in support of the taxing of debts at the debtors domicil it still seems to be generally conceded that the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam is properly applicable to intangible personal property in the form of debts and that they are taxable at the creditors or owners domicil56 56 Darnell v Indiana 226 U S 390 I9I2 Selliger v Kentucky 2I3 U S 200 I909 Southern

not taxableJURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 923 A tax at both the debtors and creditors domicil is considered constitutional The tax upon debts at the domicil of the creditor has been based upon several grounds By the fiction mobilia sequuntur personal the debt has been regarded as having a situs at the creditors domicil But this fiction can hardly be urged as a ground or justification for the tax It is rather a form of stating a result reached and an admission of the nonexistence of a reason The fiction has been repudiated in the case of a property tax levied at the owners domicil upon tangible chattels outside the state58 and the maxim is no less a fiction when applied to debts than when applied to tangible chattels and gave way even when applied to debts both in Blackstone v Miller where Justice Holmes pointed out When logic and the policy of a State conflict with a fiction due to historical tradition the fiction must give way59 and in Liverpool Insurance Co v Orleans Assessors60 where Justice Hughes said The legal fiction expressed in the maxim mobilia sequuntur personal yields to the fact of actual control elsewhere And in the case of credits though intangible arising as did those in the present instance the control adequate to confer jurisdiction may be found in the sovereignty of the debtors domicil The maxim is wholly inadequate as a principle upon which to rest the tax This has been felt by more thoughtful lawyers and they have sought to state more substantial grounds in support of the practice of imposing the tax at the creditors domicil It has been said6  It

included are those of the present writer924 HARVARD LAW REVIEW where the debtor lives for his obligation to pay is quite the reverse of being valuable to him and for similar reasons the obligation does seem to be property where the creditor lives This common sense view of the matter has been accepted by the courts and it is generally held that a debt pure and simple is not taxable as property at the residence of the debtor On the other hand generally speaking debts are taxable as property at the residence of the creditor While this view seems plausible it assumes that because the debt is valuable to the creditor it is taxable at the creditors domi cil But if debts are property at the domicil of the creditor because they are valuable to him then why are not real estate and chat tels property at the owners domicil and taxable at that place Are they less valuable to the owner at his domicil because they have corporeality elsewhere Yet we have seen that a tax upon foreign chattels levied at the owners domicil is unconstitutional as taking property without due process of law and logically is this not as applicable to a tax upon debts levied at the creditors domi cil as it is to a tax on foreign chattels A third explanation of the power of taxing it the debt at the domicil of the creditor is that as it adds to the creditors wealth the power that may tax the creditor personally may exact the tax from him based on the ability which this power over the debtor gives him to pay the tax 3 As an original proposition this expla nation would perhaps be invulnerable but our Supreme Court has taken the view that a tax upon foreign tangible property levied at the owners domicil is unconstitutional because it is taking property without due process of law It is only the state of the situs that protects and benefits the property and therefore the only one that has furnished the quid pro quo for the tax64 The situation is parallel to that of debts Tangible property no matter where located adds to the owners wealth and ability to pay in the same way that a creditors power over his debtor does As the state of the situs of tangible property protects and makes valuable the property to an owner so in the case of debts the state of the debtors domicil in the same way protects and makes the debts valuable to a 27 HARV L REV 107 114  Union Transit Co v Kentucky i99 U S

exact the tax There is considerable65 and high authority in support of a tax at the debtors domicil on the ground that power of control over the debtor furnishes the basis of jurisdiction for levying the tax In Blackstone v Miller66 the United States Supreme Court held that the state of New York could levy a succession tax upon a debt in the form of a deposit due an Illinois testator from a New York debtor In that case Justice Holmes who gave the opinion of the Court said If the transfer of the deposit necessarily depends upon and involves the law of New York for its exercise or in other words if the transfer is subject to the power of the State of New York then New York may subject the transfer to a tax United States v Perkins i63 U S 625 628 629 McCUllock v Maryland 4 Wheat 316 429 But it is plain that the transfer does depend upon the law of New York not because of any theoretical speculation concerning the whereabouts of the debt but because of the practical fact of its power over the person of the debtor The principle has been recognized by this court with regard to garnishments of a domestic debtor of an absent defendant Chicago Rock Island  Pacific Ry Co v Sturm I74 U S

again what enables any other than the very creditor in proper person to collect the debt The law of the same place To test it suppose that New York should turn back the current of legis lation and extend to debts the rule still applied to slander that action personals moritur cum persona and should provide that all debts here after contracted in New York and payable there should be extinguished by the death of either party Leaving constitutional consideration on one side it is plain that the right of the foreign creditor would be gone Power over the person of the debtor confers jurisdiction we repeat And this being so we perceive no better reason for denying the right of New York to impose a succession tax on debts owed by its citizens than upon tangible chattels found within the State at the time of the death The maxim mobilia sequuntur personal has no more truth in the one case than in the other When logic and the policy of a State conflict with a fiction due to historical tradition the fiction must give way It is now well established that the state of the debtors domicil may levy a succession tax upon debts due a nonresident decedent creditor Power of control over the debtor is admitted to furnish the basis of taxation in other cases besides those involving the succes sion tax Privilege taxes as well as other forms of taxation rest on this principle of power of control and the furnishing of a quid pro quo by the state imposing the tax68 Where a privilege tax is imposed by the state of the debtors domicil and is measured by the amount of the debts owed to a

premiums of life insurance received from business done in that state and not be taxing property beyond its jurisdiction it was observed that though the premiums were paid directly to the insurance company outside the state and though the state had no constitutional power to prevent the insurance company making the contracts and could not therefore be said to permit them of her own will still the tax was upon a privilege actually used and the state furnished the quid pro quo by protecting the lives insuredJURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 927 is the situation in numerous cases69 jurisdiction to levy such tax rests upon the fact that the state has power of control over the debtor and through that means extends protection or benefit to the foreign creditor Thus in Liverpool Insurance Co v Orleans70 a tax levied by the state of Louisiana upon amounts due a New York corporation by its policyholders in the state for premiums upon which a credit had been extended was sustained upon the ground that control adequate to confer jurisdiction may be found in the sovereignty of the debtors domicil because of the power over the debtor In that case Hughes J who gave the opinion of the court said  The legal fiction expressed in the maxim mobilia sequuntur personal yields to the fact of actual control elsewhere And in the case of credits though intangible arising as did those in the present instance the control adequate to confer jurisdiction may be found in the sover eignty of the debtors domicil The debt of course is not property in the hands of the debtor but it is an obligation of the debtor and is of value to the creditor because he may be compelled to pay and power over the debtor at his domicil is control of the ordinary means of enforce ment Blackstone v Miller i88 U S 205 206 Tested by the criteria afforded by the authorities we have cited Louisiana must be deemed to have had jurisdiction to impose the tax The credits would have had no existence save for the permission of Louisiana they issued from the business transacted under her sanction within her borders the sums were payable by persons domiciled within the State and there the rights of the creditor were to be enforced If locality in the sense of subjec tion to sovereign power could be attributed to these credits they could be localized there If as property they could be deemed to be taxable at all they could be taxed there Of course it is not sought to convey the impression that a privilege tax may be sustained as a property tax levied upon debts For example if an insurance corporation is taxed for the privilege of doing business in a state and the amount of the tax is determined by the amount of the debts due the corporation from residents of the state imposing the tax an attempt to collect a

result in inequality and unfairness as all creditors would not be taxed uni formly To sustain a tax for the privilege of doing business in a state business must be done in that state7 On the basis of a power of control analogous to that exercised over the debtor the stock of national banks and of corporations may be taxed at the place where the bank is located or the corporation incorporated without regard to the residence of the owner72 The registered bonds of a state kept by a nonresident at his domicil may be taxed by the state for the state cannot be sued on the bonds in the federal courts it can be impleaded only in its own courts and the bond can be transferred only by bringing it to the proper registration officer of the state and there complying with the law of the state respecting transfer of registration73 It would seem that ordinary bonds on this principle of power of control over the debtor should be held taxable at the domicil of the debtor though the owner holds the bonds elsewhere for it is that state through its control over the debtor that makes the obligation of the debtor of value to the creditor but it was held by the United States Supreme Court in State Tax on ForeignHeld Bonds74 that the state of Pennsylvania could not tax an Irish bondholder on the bonds of a Pennsylvania railway secured by a mortgage on its property The court accepted the fiction mobilia sequuntur personam75 which was later repudiated by the United States Supreme Court when applied to tangible chattels in Union Refrigerator Transit Co v Kentucky76 The court in State

misconceived the Pennsylvania statute there was no attempt to tax debts as assets of the debtor It is difficult to understand how anyone would so conceive of debts The mere fact that the tax was levied at the debtors domicil cer tainly does not justify that conclusion The tax was a tax upon the creditor but levied at the debtors domicil Not only was the reasoning of the court wholly unsound but the case has been practically overruled by the United States Supreme Court in Savings Society v Multnomah County and similar cases 7 and in Blackstone v Miller78 In Savings Society v Multnomah County the court held that notes given by Oregon debtors secured by mortgage upon Oregon land though held by citizens of Cali fornia were taxable by the state of Oregon The attempt the court made in the latter case to distinguish State Tax on Foreign Held Bonds on the ground that there the tax was upon the interest due to the bondholders and not upon their interest in the mortgage is not warranted by the facts of the case It was as much the interest in the mortgage that was taxed in the one case as in the other Taxes like that sustained in Savings Society v Multnomah County are not uncommon and have always been upheld79 Holmes J attempted to distinguish Blackstone v Miller where it was held that power of control over the debtor conferred jurisdiction to tax the debt against a foreign creditor at the debtors domicil from State Tax on ForeignHeld Bonds upon the ground that bonds and negotiable instruments are more than mere evidences of debt but by a tradition from archaic times constitute the debt It may be desirable that courts adopt the theory that debts in the form of specialties shall be taxable at the place where the instrument is located and if that theory is adopted consistency would require that the debts should not be taxed at the domicil of the debtor also for the theory is that the debt is merged in the specialty Of course even if that view of specialties is taken it In i69 U S 421 i898 Bristol v Washington County 177 U S 133 1900 78 i88 U S i89 1903 79 Finch vYork Co i9 Neb 50 26 N W 589 i886 In re Rogers Estate 149 Mich 305 112 N W 931 1907930 HARVARD LAW REVIEW must be recognized that it is only a theory and that the ultimate power of control which rests in the state having jurisdiction over the debtor and which is a sufficient basis for jurisdiction over the debt can never by any fiction or theory be taken from a state without its consent The decisions however will not justify the distinction taken by Justice Holmes in Blackstone v Miller While it may be that Buck v Beach80 which held that mortgage notes made by a debtor in Ohio payable in Ohio and secured by a mort gage in Ohio the owner of which resided in New York were not taxable in Indiana where they had been sent for safekeeping is reconcilable with Wheeler v New York State8 which upheld a succession tax by New York upon promissory notes belonging to a nonresident where they were found in the state of New York on the ground that in Buck v Beach the notes held not taxable in Indiana were moved backward and forward between Ohio and Indiana with the intent to avoid taxation in either state and were really not in Indiana hands for business purposes Still that does not go to the length to which Justice Holmes goes in Blackstone v Miller in order not to overrule State Tax on ForeignHeld Bonds in saying the debt has been so completely merged in the specialty that an attempt to tax it at the debtors domicil is unconstitu tional Courts never have gone and on correct principle never can go that far in their actual decisions toward recognizing the theory of a merger of the debt into the specialty The situation is now ripe for a decision by the United States Supreme Court squarely overruling State Tax on ForeignHeld Bonds Finally there seems to be no reason that can be urged in support of a property or succession tax upon debts at the creditors domicil that cannot be equally urged to support such a tax against an owner at his domicil on foreignheld real and tangible personal property The owners title to foreign property is for the state where he resides an intangible thing similar tohis right to have payment of a debt For purposes of jurisdiction foreign real property and tangible personalty are choses in action as much as debts are82 80 206 U S 392 1907 81 233 U S 434 1914 82 Ames in his lecture The Nature of Ownership speaking of the interest of the disseisee says For as we have seen this interest being a chose in action was not transferable at common law either by conveyance inter vivos or by will nor even as a rule by operation of law AMES LECTURES ON LEGAL HISTORY 192JURISDICTION OVER DEBTS 93 I If the property or debtor is outside the jurisdiction there seems to be no essential difference in the power of control over the property from that over the debt or in the protection afforded to the owner of the property from that afforded the owner of the debt by the sovereign of his domicil If therefore a tax at the owners domicil cannot be supported in case of foreignowned real estate and chattels it is difficult to see how it can be supported on other than historical grounds against a creditor at his domicil on debts owed by a foreign debtor On the other hand every reason which goes to support the taxa tion of real and tangible personal property at its situs can be urged in support of a tax upon debts against the creditor at the debtors domicil The real reason why tangible property is taxable at its situs is not that it occupies space there but that the sovereign where it is located can exercise control over it there and thus afford it the protection for which the tax is exacted In like manner the sovereign of the debtors domicil has control over the obligation by having jurisdiction over the debtor and protects it and the debtor and makes the debt valuable to the creditor It profits the foreign creditor as respects the debt in the same way it does the foreign owner of tangible property within its jurisdiction And in like manner such state and such state alone should be the one to levy the tax83 Charles E Carpenter UNIVERSITY OF ILLINOIS URBANA ILLINOIS 83 While from an economic standpoint debts should not be taxed as they do not represent wealth still a tax at the domicil of the debtor has several economic advan tages over the present method It will prevent duplication in taxation  a very desir able result  and the present notorious method of tax evasion practiced by conceal ment of the identity of the creditor in debts secured by trust deeds on real estate will be avoided and there will be no greater likelihood of concealment of debts in general under a system of taxing debts at the domicil of the debtor than at the domicil of the creditor So far as shifting the burden of taxation from creditor to debtor is concerned a tax collected at the creditors domicil will be as objectionable in that respect as one collected at the debtors domicil The interest rate will be affected in either instance if the tax upon debts is made effective

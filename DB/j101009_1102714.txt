PortugalOne of the first Acts of the new Republican Govern ment was to pass to a drastic reform of the Divorce Law By the new law which is issued by the Provisional Republican Government in the form of a simple decree divorce can be demanded by either husband or wife on the same terms or by both spouses together Besides adultery cruelty insulting conduct three years desertion in curable insanity and inveterate gambling propensities are recog nised as good grounds for divorce The last provision is a novel feature in the European laws of divorce The divorced wife will be entitled to marry again one year after the pronouncement of the de cree while the husband may marry again six months from that date London Law Journal The Increase in CrimeMr Simpsons introduction to the newly published volume of criminal statistics is an admirable piece of work which fully deserves the wide attention it has received It is cer tainly not a pleasing tale he has to tell During last century the pro portion of crime to population tended to fall he writes during this century it has risen It is a disquieting fact During the five years ending 1899 there was an annual average of 163 persons tried for indictable offences for every 100000 of the population in the succeeding quenquennial period the number rose to 172 during the five years ending 1909the year with which the new volume of statistics dealsthe number increased to 181 Mr Simpson does not take too pessimistic a view of these figures but some of the more sensational journals have perceived in them a significance cal culated to unnecessarily disturb their lawabiding readers The in crease recorded in the latest volume of criminal statistics does not justify the alarming view expressed in some quarters that England is more criminal than it used to be Forty years ago 277 persons were 1911 875 MISCELLANY16 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER tried for indictable crimes out of every 100000 of the population Notwithstanding then the regrettable increase of the past ten years it remains true that in proportion to the population the amount of serious crime is onethird less than it wasbefore the Education Act was passed It is true that during the same period the proportion of nonindictable offences to the population has grown During the five years ending 1869 the average number of persons tried for non indictable offences was 1969 for every 100000 of the population while during the five years ending 1909 the average number of such per sons was 1982 Even here however there it no real occasion for despondency In 18751879 the annual average was 2385 in 1885 1899 it was 2152 in 18851899 it was 2248 So that while the pro portion of indictable crimes has increased during the past ten years the proportion of nonindictable offences has decreased during the same period And it is always to be remembered in connection with the nonindictable offences that many of them are breaches of new municipal laws For instance there were 38951 offences against the Education Acts in 1909 while there were of course none in 1869 The vast growth of vehicular traffic has a considerable influ ence upon the volume of nonindictable crime Offences against the Highway Acts which numbered but 15066 forty years ago have now increased to 61556 and breaches of police regulations have risen from 44494 to 103628 There is on the whole no substantial ground for the belief that the world as reflected in these statistics of crime is growing worseLondon Law Journal Sentimentality and CriminalityWhat are the reasons for the in crease in criminality which has taken place during the past ten years What to put the question more correctly is the explanation of the continuous decrease in the last century having been arrested Mr Simpson has some interesting theories on the matter some of which deserve to be carefully considered by those desirous of re forming our penal system The growth of an unwise compassion for officialism among sentimental persons the glorification of the more daring and ingenious criminal in certain quarters of the Press the romantic touch lent to dishonesty by the creation of such popular heroes of fiction as Raffles and Arsene Lupin the loss in prison life of some of its terror for the evildoerthese are the suggestions put forward by Mr Simpson by way of explanation of the recent in crease in criminality The first and last of these suggestions which are not unconnected demand the most attention It is a remarkable fact that the proportion of persons who go to prison in default of payment of fines has grown rapidly during the past ten years In 1899 when 563378 persons were sentenced to pay fines 83855 were imprisoned in default in 1909 when 460015 were sentenced to pay fines 92699 went to prison In other words the percentage of per 876 March1911 MISCELLANY 877 sons imprisoned to persons fined grew from 15 to 20 These figures would certainly seem to indicate that imprisonment as Mr Simpson puts it is coming to be regarded more as a misfortune than a dis grace It will obviously be a disastrous thing for the community if by reason of a sentimental feeling towards criminality or by unwise changes in our penal system the terror of prison life is diminished and it behoves both sentimentalists and reformers to bear in mind the lesson of the figures we have referred to Not of course that the scientific and more humane treatment of crime is to be dep recated On the contrary the sociological and psychological study of crime is to be encouraged and the more humane methods of pun ishment such as those instituted by the Probation of Offenders Act and the Borstal system cannot fail in the long run to have a bene ficial effect But the good which will be done in this direction will certainly be impaired if mere sentimentality is allowed to play a prominent part in the punishment of crimeLondon Law Journal

undertaken by one whofe abilities are fo far inferior as mine little fuccefs can be expeated This re mark announces the difficulty of the fubjeCt I am about to inveftigate neverthelefs I am flimulated by the indufiry of my predeceffors and if I cannot promife much new matter I hope to be at leatt able to verify fome obfervations and perhaps difprove others for in proportion as we remove errors we approach nearer to truth When we are fully perfuaded that to live and to breathe are fynonimous terms and that the abfolute neceffity of air to the maintenance of animal life has been fully eftablifhed by repeated and well concerted experiments we need not be furprifed to find many perfons engaged in an examina tion of the chemical qualities of our atmofphere  the names of Scheele Priefily Lavoifier Fontana c will for ever make this branch of fcience refpeCtable From the earlieR ages it has been fuppofed that the at mofphere has great influLence on the human body in produc ing difeafe as well as in reftoring health hence the ac counts of Hippocrates Sydenham and Huxham Phyfi cians ought always to notice the ftate of the atimofplhere during the prevalence of epidemic difeafes Before faUts were colleCted and experiments well per formed the atmofphere was fufpetted to differ materially in almofi every fituation but latter experiments have prov ed that our notions have been erroneous to a great degree In4i6 EXPERIMENTS ox In a former memoir which I had the honour to read be fore this fociety I paid particular attention to the atmof phere over the ocean rivers and neighbouring land and hope that my experitnents have been of fome fervice to wards the eflablifihment of truth in the prefent effiay I in tend giving an account of fome experiments which 1 per formed at different times on the air over marfhes A few general remarks refpeaing the common ifate of our atmofphere perhaps become neceffary for the fake of future comparifons We no longer believe for experiments have taught us the contrary that our atmofphere is an homogeneous ele merit the prefent ingenious doatrines of heat have thrown much light upon the fubjeLt and with much reafon fome philofophers are induced to believe  that the aeriform ftate is a modification of bodies dependent on the degree of temperature and on the preffure which thefe bodies under go  This opinion has been extended fo far as to induce fome to fay  Perhaps alfo metals are contained in the at inofpleret Thefe fentiment do not appear to be merely conjeatural for Cliaptal has precipitated mercury from ox ygen gas whiclh was obtained from red precipitate by means of ice and the family of Achard fuffered ptyalifm from breathing in an atmofphere where mercury had been expofed for fome time in a faucer The above opinions if true and I think them highly pro bable prepare us to meet many difficulties in the analyfis ofthe atmofphere But all I exped to do is to open the paffage and I fhall leave others to render it more certain for nume rous experiments and thofe often repeated are the only means whereby we can afcertain truth and I fear the la bours of one man are infufficient to perform this tafk

more efpeci ally fince we find that our principal cities are alinofl year ly affli6led with a terrible epidemic which has been by fome attributed to tlle flate of the air Future difcoveries it is hoped will multiply the number of tefis for airs and thus render the fubjeat more eafy Refpe6table chemifts have determined the component parts of ouir commoil atmofphere to be Oxygen gas 27 Azotic gas 72 Carbonic acid gas oI Any deviation from this flatement muff be attributed to local circumfiances I fhall firft endeavour to determine whether or not the air of marflhes differs from that of other fituations  2 What are the caufes of the differences which are found to exiIf  and 3 Make a few obfervations and remarks I March 3 1 1t I 793 Air was obtained by agitating ftagnant water over marihy grounds the following ex periments were then performed a It burned when a candle was applied to it the flame was blue it did not explode when mixed with atmof pheric air b Agitated with lime water a copious white precipi tate was formed c Its bulk was confiderably diminilhed by agitating it with lime water d Equal bulks of it and nitrous gas were introduced in to my eudiometer tube and a diminution of T1 of their bulk was perceptible Thefe experiments were frequently repeated and the re fults were fimilar to the abovementioned  they warrant the following inferences 3 a That4I8 EXPERIMENTS o N a That carbonic acid gas enters largely into the compo fition of the air examined b That hydrogen gas is an ingredient in it c T hat no oxygen gas was prefent for the finall ab forption which took place I attribute to the aaion of the water with which the airs were agitated The above experiments were performed on the air wlhich was obtained immediately as it was difengaged from the marflhy foil it became neceffary to examine the air fituat ed at fome diftance above the marfh At different times during the fummer of 1798 I collea ed air from above marfhy grounds the following experi ments were performed on it 11 When agitated with lime water it afforded a precipi tate which was not fo abundant as in the former expe riments b Mixed with nitrous air its bulk was diminifhed to almoft as great a degree as the air in the yard of my lodg ings c Either pure or mixed with atmofpheric air it did not burn or explode when a candle was applied to it Hence it appears that the air obtained at the height of feveral feet above marfhes i Contains little or no hydrogen gas 2 That the proportion of carbonic acid gas is pretty con fiderable and 3 What is of great confequence to be obferved a large quantity of oxygen gas enters into its compofition The lafi mentioned faacs induce us to believe that the air above marfhes is not confiderably different in its properties from the common atmofphere in other fituations where animals refpire with eafe and enjoy perfeat health except the proportion of carbonic acid gas being greater and this I am induced to believe diminifhes in quantity as we afcend for faats related by travellers who have vifited the Grotto dclMARSH AIR 419 del Cane and other fimilar places prove that the gravity of this elaflic fluid permits it to rife but to an inconfiderable heiglht After having proved that certain qualities do exift in the air over marflhes which are different from thofe poffeffedby the atmofphere in other fituations we muff next attend to our Second objeO viz to afeertain what are the circum flances about marfhes which produce fuch effeas Before we proceed any furtlher it is of the greateft im portance to be fatisfied refpeating the changes wvhich may be produced on common atmofpheric air when fubjeaed to the aation of the foil of marflhes At differernt times in the months of September and the commencement of October I 796 1 expofed atmofpheric air to the aaion of mud which I obtained from marflhes below the city The fame was done at different times in the months of April and July 1798 The experiments were expofed to the temperature of the atmofphere The refults from the different experirnents were fimilar The air was expofed to the adaion of the mud which was con tained in a tumbler by means of an inverted glafs jar in a bafon containing a fmall quantity of water The follow ing changes were noticed I rhe air contained in the jar became much diminifh ed in bulk as was proved by the water rifring into the jar 2 The air tlhus aded upon when agitated with lime wvater affordecd a copious white precipitate and became di nmiinifhed in bulk 3 In fome of the jars were fufpended papers flained blue with litmus and yellow with turmeric the blue rc ceived a reddifh tinge and the yellow remained unaltered the red was again clhanged to a bltue by expofure to the va pour iffuing from a bottle containing ammoniac 4 The air thus altered by the mud when mixed with nitrous gas in the eudiometer tube was in every inflance 3 I 2 found420 EXPERIMENTS o N found to have lofI in point of purity fometimes no dimi nution of bulk whatever took place The following circumftances feemed to influence the laft mentioned experiments ift TemperatuLre 2d The lengtlh of time during wvhich they were continued And 3d The proportion which the mud and air bore to each other the furface of the mud being more or lefs extenfive feemed alfo to have its effeds The air thus affeaed by the aaion of the mud would in no inflance burn or explode when a candle was applied to it hence it contained but a fmall quantity of hydrogen gas This laft mentioned fad induced me to engage in an ef fay to determine the origin of the hydrogen gas which abounds in the air obtained by agitating Jlagnant waters It is neceffary to be obferved that in the above experi ments with mud but a fmall proportion of water was ad ded to it in the tumbler the quiantity was juft fufficient to promote putrefadion I am of opinion that the hydrogen gas is afforded by a decompofition of the flagnant water effeaed by the putrefaation of the dead animal and vegeta ble fubftances which enter largely into the compofition of the foil of marfhes I was induced to form this opinion becaufe firft plire water is a compound of but two elemeiits confequently the affinity cannot be broken but by the ac tion of a third fubftance And fecondly we have no ex periments which prove that pure water has undergone fpon taneous decompofition My ideas are confirmed by a fat well known to all feamen viz when a candle is applied to the bung hole of a caik containing river water wlhich had been for fome time clofely ftopped an elaftic fluid efcapes which will inflame and appears in all refpedas fimilar to hy drogen gas obtained by other means After forming the above conjeures I determined to perform a few experiments which might tend to confirm or difprove my opinion With this view mud and water withMARSH AIR 421 with a very fmall portion of atmofpheric air were at dif ferent times confined in bottles clofely ftopped and invert ed over water in fome inflances the experirmient was con tinued during 20 and 30 days They were fubjeafled to the temperature of the atmofphere During the progrefs of the experiments 1 perceived that an elaitic fluid was difengaged from the materials contained in the bottles and that the water was evidently diminithed in bulk the elaflic fluid generated during thefe experiments i f inflantly formed a copious white precipitate when agitated with lime water 2dly it burned wrhen the flame of a candle was applied to it and poffeffed the other properties which are common to air obtained by agitating flagnant waters over marfhes Thefe faSts are decifive to me on the fubjed and con firm the above conjed6ures refpedfing the origin of the hy drogen gas difengaged from marfhy grounds It is necef fary to remark that fome danger attends thefe laft experi ments for a large bottle which was clofed by a ground flop per was broken on the 25th day of the experiment by an expanfion of the contained edaftic fluid the pieces which were large were thrown to the diftance of 2o feet and a report was heard louder than that from the firing of a mufket In general the bottles had corks faftened by means of firings bound round them as foon as I cut the firings the corks were forced from the tnecks of the bot tles with confiderable violence The above experiments teach us that mud vitiates the at mofphere in a very powerful manner They alfo enable us to account for the prefence of the elaftic fluid forming the atmofphere of marfhes It appears that the carbone of the mud unites with the oxygen of the decompofed waZ ter and forms tlle carbonic acid gas whilfi the hydrogen gas is fet at liberty Thefe are truths not to be invalidated by gratuitous affertions fince their bafis is experiment It422 EXPERIMENTS oN It may be afked if mud feizes oxygen gas witlh the avi dity iflated how comes it that euldiometrical experinments prove the air over marfhes to be nearly if not quite of thie lame degree of purity as that of other fituations  At firfi an anfwer to this important queftion may fecin difficult but fome examination of the circuinftances at tending the fituation of marfhes enables uis to account for it in a very fatisfaaory manner It is to be remarked that in my trials xwith mud the air was confined tunder glafs vef fels over water confequently no circumftances from with out could have any influence on the experiments The air over marfhy fituations is very different it poffeffes all the advantages of ventilation c in common with the at mofphere Befides thefe circumfIances a large quantitr of oxygen gas is afforded by the living vegetables which furround them in abundance We may alfo obferve that frequently large ponds of wirater are found in their neighbourhood and that often rivers are at no great diftance from them  may not therefore a quantity of oxygen gas be difengaged from thefe waters by the adtion of the fun  Ex periments are related by reputable authors whlerein wNa ter has been decompofed by the adtion of the funs rays of this more hereafter That the atmofphere of marfhes therefore differs in certain circumflances from that of other fituations and that the foil has confiderable effed in altering the air of the at mofphere I think cannot be doubted Let us therefore endeavour to difcover the particular local caufes which give rife to thefe variations I have before hinted that the putrefadion of the animal and vegetable matters upon the foil of iarihes was the great caufe of the changes obferved to exift for

new combinations All chemiffs acknowledge the analyfis of animal and ve gretable fubftances to be imperfede Lavoifier has paid par ticular attention to the fubjed He performed numerous and accurate experiments to determine their compofition and notices in a particuilar manner the refults they afford during their putrefadion According to him they con filt chiefly of hydrogen and oxygen combined with car bone thefe fubftances he fays are found in all vegetables and none exifi without them Animal fubftances contain more hydrogen and azote than vegetables do they alfo have carbone as a conftituent part of their compofition fome of both claffes contain fulphur and phofphorus The above are the principles which I fuppofe are liable to be aded upon and thus produce the effedts we are about to confider Before we can underftand the changes to which the above fubifances are liable we muff take into confideration that our atmofphere is compofed of the azotic and oxygen gafes and a fmall portion of carbonic acid gas many view this laft as adventitious and by no means neceffary Heat moifture the contad of atmofpheric air and reft wve know are circumftances attendant on marlhy fituations during the unhealthy feafons A priori we might be induced to believe that the fol lowing phenomena would take place under the above circumifances 1 ThatMARSH AIR 425 Y That hydrogen gas would be difengaged C That the oxygen combining with the carbone would form the carbonic acid gas 3 That azote would unite with a por tion of hydrogen and thus produce ammoniac whilft an other portion of it would during its combination with ox ygen form the nitric acid And 4th That when fulphur or phofphorus were prefent they with hydrogen would form the fulphurated and phofphorated hydrogen gafes We fhall now endeavour to difcover whether or not thefe elaflic fluids enter into the compofition of the atmof phere of marfhes I flydrogen gas DoCtor Franklin has long fince de monfirated the prodution of this elaftic fluid in marfhy fi tuations Ingenhoufz and otlhers have confirmed the trutl of his experiments and obfervations My experiments convince me that it is produced in a confiderable quantity and that it may be eafily procured by agitating flagnant waters over marfhes It is alfo evi lent that this gas is in a ftate of mixture with the carbonic acid gas Althouglh we are certain that a large quantity of hydro gen gas is difengaged from marfhy grounds we muff ne verthelefs conclude that it bears but an inconfiderable pro portion to the atmofphere at large for we find that the air immediately above marihes will not explode upon the ap proach of a candle indeed from its levity we might fup pofe that it occupies the inferior firata of the atmofphere blut for a fhort time 2 Carbonic acid gas That this elaftic fluid enters large ly into the compofition of the atmolphere of marffhes is eafily proved by agitating it with lime water 3 Ammoniacal gas The produ6tion of this gas dur ing putrefaCtion is proved beyond doubt therefore that it fhould exift in the atmofphere of marfhes feems at leaft probable indeed many have inferred confiderable effeCts 3 K from426 E XPERIMENTS oN from its prefence but as they did not detet it by any teLt with which we are acquainted their opinion is entirely lhypothetical The following are the refults of the means I employed to difcover wlhether ammoniacal gas is prefent in the at mofphere of marthes i No white clouds appeared when mnuriatic acid gas was mixed with air obtained by agitating flagnant waters 2 Slips of paper flained yellow by turme ric were fufpended in a bottle containing mud and atmof pheric air it remained unchanged whereas thofe ftained with litmuts received a reddifh tinge 3 1 never could per ceive the odour peculiar to this alkali when I vifited marfhes The above experiments caufed me to doubt the prefence of this elaflic fluid in the atmofphere of marfhes I was confirmned in this opinion by the following circumfiances ifi Ammoniac combines readily with water it is impoffi lle to procure ammoniacal gas over water therefore we are to fuppofe that if this fluid is produced it is inimediately abforbed by the water of the marfh 2dly Carbonic acid gas is abundant in the atmofphere of marihes By experi ment I afcertained that this acid and ammoniacal gas were very prone to unite and form the carbonate of amrnoniac The experiment was performed in a glafs tube over mercu ry as foon as the two elaftic fluids came in conta an ab forption took place and the builk of them was

I affert that the atmofphere of marflT es is equally pure with that of other fituations I mean that it contains as large a proportion of oxygen gas as fuch other atmofplheres do I do not by any means intelnd to be underftood that it is free from foreign mixtures I have acknowledged that putrefadtion is going on in marfhy places and likewife admit that this procefs de flroys the purity of the atmofphere by abforbing its oxy gen therefore it may feem difficult to admit the abfolue purity of the air being equal here to that of other places IPeople being able to breathe with eafe over marfliy grounds is fufficient proof that the oxygen gas there is adequate to Iipport life I fliall now attempt to account for the purity of the air of marfhes as follows Sennebier has proved by numerous experitnents that living vegetables placed in an atmofphere of carbonic acid gas or in water faturated with this air expofed to the aation of the fun thrive and grow very rapidly during the experiments the carbonic acid is deftroyed and oxygen gas is difengaged In addition to thefe experiments Ingenhoufz has taught us that the aqua tic plants particularly fuch as grow in the

made when fpeaking of the effedts of mud on the atmofphere I think are fufficient to account for the phenomenon which at firfi feemed at leaft doubtful The above view of this difficult fubjea will

atmnofphere in a roper degrce of purity for it is not only the irnpure atmofphiere whiich kills animials but the too ptire alfo and an ingeniouis pliilofopher has wvell oblferved that animals live too

poffefs of purifying the atrnofpherc fo that the oxygen may exift in a proper proportion fit to fupport animal life and combuftion I amn of opinion that ere long marihes will be looked upon by mankind as gifts frotn Heaven to prolong the life and happinefs of the greatefi portion of the animal kingdom Perhaps it was originally intended that they fhould remain uniinhabited and that their only tife

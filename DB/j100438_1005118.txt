UNDERTAKEN BY ONE WHOFE ABILITIES ARE FO FAR INFERIOR AS MINE LITTLE FUCCEFS CAN BE EXPEATED THIS RE MARK ANNOUNCES THE DIFFICULTY OF THE FUBJECT I AM ABOUT TO INVEFTIGATE NEVERTHELEFS I AM FLIMULATED BY THE INDUFIRY OF MY PREDECEFFORS AND IF I CANNOT PROMIFE MUCH NEW MATTER I HOPE TO BE AT LEATT ABLE TO VERIFY FOME OBFERVATIONS AND PERHAPS DIFPROVE OTHERS FOR IN PROPORTION AS WE REMOVE ERRORS WE APPROACH NEARER TO TRUTH WHEN WE ARE FULLY PERFUADED THAT TO LIVE AND TO BREATHE ARE FYNONIMOUS TERMS AND THAT THE ABFOLUTE NECEFFITY OF AIR TO THE MAINTENANCE OF ANIMAL LIFE HAS BEEN FULLY EFTABLIFHED BY REPEATED AND WELL CONCERTED EXPERIMENTS WE NEED NOT BE FURPRIFED TO FIND MANY PERFONS ENGAGED IN AN EXAMINA TION OF THE CHEMICAL QUALITIES OF OUR ATMOFPHERE  THE NAMES OF SCHEELE PRIEFILY LAVOIFIER FONTANA C WILL FOR EVER MAKE THIS BRANCH OF FCIENCE REFPECTABLE FROM THE EARLIER AGES IT HAS BEEN FUPPOFED THAT THE AT MOFPHERE HAS GREAT INFLULENCE ON THE HUMAN BODY IN PRODUC ING DIFEAFE AS WELL AS IN REFTORING HEALTH HENCE THE AC COUNTS OF HIPPOCRATES SYDENHAM AND HUXHAM PHYFI CIANS OUGHT ALWAYS TO NOTICE THE FTATE OF THE ATIMOFPLHERE DURING THE PREVALENCE OF EPIDEMIC DIFEAFES BEFORE FAUTS WERE COLLECTED AND EXPERIMENTS WELL PER FORMED THE ATMOFPHERE WAS FUFPETTED TO DIFFER MATERIALLY IN ALMOFI EVERY FITUATION BUT LATTER EXPERIMENTS HAVE PROV ED THAT OUR NOTIONS HAVE BEEN ERRONEOUS TO A GREAT DEGREE IN4I6 EXPERIMENTS OX IN A FORMER MEMOIR WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR TO READ BE FORE THIS FOCIETY I PAID PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THE ATMOF PHERE OVER THE OCEAN RIVERS AND NEIGHBOURING LAND AND HOPE THAT MY EXPERITNENTS HAVE BEEN OF FOME FERVICE TO WARDS THE EFLABLIFIHMENT OF TRUTH IN THE PREFENT EFFIAY I IN TEND GIVING AN ACCOUNT OF FOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH 1 PER FORMED AT DIFFERENT TIMES ON THE AIR OVER MARFHES A FEW GENERAL REMARKS REFPEAING THE COMMON IFATE OF OUR ATMOFPHERE PERHAPS BECOME NECEFFARY FOR THE FAKE OF FUTURE COMPARIFONS WE NO LONGER BELIEVE FOR EXPERIMENTS HAVE TAUGHT US THE CONTRARY THAT OUR ATMOFPHERE IS AN HOMOGENEOUS ELE MERIT THE PREFENT INGENIOUS DOATRINES OF HEAT HAVE THROWN MUCH LIGHT UPON THE FUBJELT AND WITH MUCH REAFON FOME PHILOFOPHERS ARE INDUCED TO BELIEVE  THAT THE AERIFORM FTATE IS A MODIFICATION OF BODIES DEPENDENT ON THE DEGREE OF TEMPERATURE AND ON THE PREFFURE WHICH THEFE BODIES UNDER GO  THIS OPINION HAS BEEN EXTENDED FO FAR AS TO INDUCE FOME TO FAY  PERHAPS ALFO METALS ARE CONTAINED IN THE AT INOFPLERET THEFE FENTIMENT DO NOT APPEAR TO BE MERELY CONJEATURAL FOR CLIAPTAL HAS PRECIPITATED MERCURY FROM OX YGEN GAS WHICLH WAS OBTAINED FROM RED PRECIPITATE BY MEANS OF ICE AND THE FAMILY OF ACHARD FUFFERED PTYALIFM FROM BREATHING IN AN ATMOFPHERE WHERE MERCURY HAD BEEN EXPOFED FOR FOME TIME IN A FAUCER THE ABOVE OPINIONS IF TRUE AND I THINK THEM HIGHLY PRO BABLE PREPARE US TO MEET MANY DIFFICULTIES IN THE ANALYFIS OFTHE ATMOFPHERE BUT ALL I EXPED TO DO IS TO OPEN THE PAFFAGE AND I FHALL LEAVE OTHERS TO RENDER IT MORE CERTAIN FOR NUME ROUS EXPERIMENTS AND THOFE OFTEN REPEATED ARE THE ONLY MEANS WHEREBY WE CAN AFCERTAIN TRUTH AND I FEAR THE LA BOURS OF ONE MAN ARE INFUFFICIENT TO PERFORM THIS TAFK

FROM THE MARFLHY FOIL IT BECAME NECEFFARY TO EXAMINE THE AIR FITUAT ED AT FOME DIFTANCE ABOVE THE MARFH AT DIFFERENT TIMES DURING THE FUMMER OF 1798 I COLLEA ED AIR FROM ABOVE MARFHY GROUNDS THE FOLLOWING EXPERI MENTS WERE PERFORMED ON IT 11 WHEN AGITATED WITH LIME WATER IT AFFORDED A PRECIPI TATE WHICH WAS NOT FO ABUNDANT AS IN THE FORMER EXPE RIMENTS B MIXED WITH NITROUS AIR ITS BULK WAS DIMINIFHED TO ALMOFT AS GREAT A DEGREE AS THE AIR IN THE YARD OF MY LODG INGS C EITHER PURE OR MIXED WITH ATMOFPHERIC AIR IT DID NOT BURN OR EXPLODE WHEN A CANDLE WAS APPLIED TO IT HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE AIR OBTAINED AT THE HEIGHT OF FEVERAL FEET ABOVE MARFHES I CONTAINS LITTLE OR NO HYDROGEN GAS 2 THAT THE PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID GAS IS PRETTY CON FIDERABLE AND 3 WHAT IS OF GREAT CONFEQUENCE TO BE OBFERVED A LARGE QUANTITY OF OXYGEN GAS ENTERS INTO ITS COMPOFITION THE LAFI MENTIONED FAACS INDUCE US TO BELIEVE THAT THE AIR ABOVE MARFHES IS NOT CONFIDERABLY DIFFERENT IN ITS PROPERTIES FROM THE COMMON ATMOFPHERE IN OTHER FITUATIONS WHERE ANIMALS REFPIRE WITH EAFE AND ENJOY PERFEAT HEALTH EXCEPT THE PROPORTION OF CARBONIC ACID GAS BEING GREATER AND THIS I AM INDUCED TO BELIEVE DIMINIFHES IN QUANTITY AS WE AFCEND FOR FAATS RELATED BY TRAVELLERS WHO HAVE VIFITED THE GROTTO DCLMARSH AIR 419 DEL CANE AND OTHER FIMILAR PLACES PROVE THAT THE GRAVITY OF THIS ELAFLIC FLUID PERMITS IT TO RIFE BUT TO AN INCONFIDERABLE HEIGLHT AFTER HAVING PROVED THAT CERTAIN QUALITIES DO EXIFT IN THE AIR OVER MARFLHES WHICH ARE DIFFERENT FROM THOFE POFFEFFEDBY THE ATMOFPHERE IN OTHER FITUATIONS WE MUFF NEXT ATTEND TO OUR SECOND OBJEO VIZ TO AFEERTAIN WHAT ARE THE CIRCUM FLANCES ABOUT MARFHES WHICH PRODUCE FUCH EFFEAS BEFORE WE PROCEED ANY FURTLHER IT IS OF THE GREATEFT IM PORTANCE TO BE FATISFIED REFPEATING THE CHANGES WVHICH MAY BE PRODUCED ON COMMON ATMOFPHERIC AIR WHEN FUBJEAED TO THE AATION OF THE FOIL OF MARFLHES AT DIFFERERNT TIMES IN THE MONTHS OF SEPTEMBER AND THE COMMENCEMENT OF OCTOBER I 796 1 EXPOFED ATMOFPHERIC AIR TO THE AAION OF MUD WHICH I OBTAINED FROM MARFLHES BELOW THE CITY THE FAME WAS DONE AT DIFFERENT TIMES IN THE MONTHS OF APRIL AND JULY 1798 THE EXPERIMENTS WERE EXPOFED TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOFPHERE THE REFULTS FROM THE DIFFERENT EXPERIRNENTS WERE FIMILAR THE AIR WAS EXPOFED TO THE ADAION OF THE MUD WHICH WAS CON TAINED IN A TUMBLER BY MEANS OF AN INVERTED GLAFS JAR IN A BAFON CONTAINING A FMALL QUANTITY OF WATER THE FOLLOW ING CHANGES WERE NOTICED I RHE AIR CONTAINED IN THE JAR BECAME MUCH DIMINIFH ED IN BULK AS WAS PROVED BY THE

WERE CONTINUED AND 3D THE PROPORTION WHICH THE MUD AND AIR BORE TO EACH OTHER THE FURFACE OF THE MUD BEING MORE OR LEFS EXTENFIVE FEEMED ALFO TO HAVE ITS EFFEDS THE AIR THUS AFFEAED BY THE AAION OF THE MUD WOULD IN NO INFLANCE BURN OR EXPLODE WHEN A CANDLE WAS APPLIED TO IT HENCE IT CONTAINED BUT A FMALL QUANTITY OF HYDROGEN GAS THIS LAFT MENTIONED FAD INDUCED ME TO ENGAGE IN AN EF FAY TO DETERMINE THE ORIGIN OF THE HYDROGEN GAS WHICH ABOUNDS IN THE AIR OBTAINED BY AGITATING JLAGNANT WATERS IT IS NECEFFARY TO BE OBFERVED THAT IN THE ABOVE EXPERI MENTS WITH MUD BUT A FMALL PROPORTION OF WATER WAS AD DED TO IT IN THE TUMBLER THE QUIANTITY WAS JUFT FUFFICIENT TO PROMOTE PUTREFADION I AM OF OPINION THAT THE HYDROGEN GAS IS AFFORDED BY A DECOMPOFITION OF THE FLAGNANT WATER EFFEAED BY THE PUTREFAATION OF THE DEAD ANIMAL AND VEGETA BLE FUBFTANCES WHICH ENTER LARGELY INTO THE COMPOFITION OF THE FOIL OF MARFHES I WAS INDUCED TO FORM THIS OPINION BECAUFE FIRFT PLIRE WATER IS A COMPOUND OF BUT TWO ELEMEIITS CONFEQUENTLY THE AFFINITY CANNOT BE BROKEN BUT BY THE AC TION OF A THIRD FUBFTANCE AND FECONDLY WE HAVE NO EX PERIMENTS WHICH PROVE THAT PURE WATER HAS UNDERGONE FPON TANEOUS DECOMPOFITION MY IDEAS ARE CONFIRMED BY A FAT WELL KNOWN TO ALL FEAMEN VIZ WHEN A CANDLE IS APPLIED TO THE BUNG HOLE OF A CAIK CONTAINING RIVER WATER WLHICH HAD BEEN FOR FOME TIME CLOFELY FTOPPED AN ELAFTIC FLUID EFCAPES WHICH WILL INFLAME AND APPEARS IN ALL REFPEDAS FIMILAR TO HY DROGEN GAS OBTAINED BY OTHER MEANS AFTER FORMING THE ABOVE CONJEURES I DETERMINED TO PERFORM A FEW EXPERIMENTS WHICH MIGHT TEND TO CONFIRM OR DIFPROVE MY OPINION WITH THIS VIEW MUD AND WATER WITHMARSH AIR 421 WITH A VERY FMALL PORTION OF ATMOFPHERIC AIR WERE AT DIF FERENT TIMES CONFINED IN BOTTLES CLOFELY FTOPPED AND INVERT ED OVER WATER IN FOME INFLANCES THE EXPERIRMIENT WAS CON TINUED DURING 20 AND 30 DAYS THEY WERE FUBJEAFLED TO THE TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOFPHERE DURING THE PROGREFS OF THE EXPERIMENTS 1 PERCEIVED THAT AN ELAITIC FLUID WAS DIFENGAGED FROM THE MATERIALS CONTAINED IN THE BOTTLES AND THAT THE WATER WAS EVIDENTLY DIMINITHED IN BULK THE ELAFLIC FLUID GENERATED DURING THEFE EXPERIMENTS I F INFLANTLY FORMED A COPIOUS WHITE PRECIPITATE WHEN AGITATED WITH LIME WATER 2DLY IT BURNED WRHEN THE FLAME OF A CANDLE WAS APPLIED TO IT AND POFFEFFED THE OTHER PROPERTIES WHICH ARE COMMON TO AIR OBTAINED BY AGITATING FLAGNANT WATERS OVER MARFHES THEFE FASTS ARE DECIFIVE TO ME ON THE FUBJED AND CON FIRM THE ABOVE CONJED6URES REFPEDFING THE ORIGIN OF THE HY DROGEN GAS DIFENGAGED FROM MARFHY GROUNDS IT IS NECEF FARY TO REMARK THAT FOME DANGER ATTENDS THEFE LAFT EXPERI MENTS FOR A LARGE BOTTLE WHICH WAS CLOFED BY A GROUND FLOP PER WAS BROKEN ON THE 25TH DAY OF THE EXPERIMENT BY AN EXPANFION OF THE CONTAINED EDAFTIC FLUID THE PIECES WHICH WERE LARGE WERE THROWN TO THE DIFTANCE OF 2O FEET AND A REPORT WAS HEARD LOUDER THAN THAT FROM THE FIRING OF A MUFKET IN GENERAL THE BOTTLES HAD CORKS FAFTENED BY MEANS OF FIRINGS BOUND ROUND THEM AS FOON AS I CUT THE FIRINGS THE CORKS WERE FORCED FROM THE TNECKS OF THE BOT TLES WITH CONFIDERABLE VIOLENCE THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS TEACH US THAT MUD VITIATES THE AT MOFPHERE IN A VERY POWERFUL MANNER THEY ALFO ENABLE US TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PREFENCE OF THE ELAFTIC FLUID FORMING THE ATMOFPHERE OF MARFHES IT APPEARS THAT THE CARBONE OF THE MUD UNITES WITH THE OXYGEN OF THE DECOMPOFED WAZ TER AND FORMS TLLE CARBONIC ACID GAS WHILFI THE HYDROGEN GAS IS FET AT LIBERTY THEFE ARE TRUTHS NOT TO BE INVALIDATED BY GRATUITOUS AFFERTIONS FINCE THEIR BAFIS IS EXPERIMENT IT422 EXPERIMENTS ON IT MAY BE AFKED IF MUD FEIZES OXYGEN GAS WITLH THE AVI DITY IFLATED HOW COMES IT THAT EULDIOMETRICAL EXPERINMENTS PROVE THE AIR OVER MARFHES TO BE NEARLY IF NOT QUITE OF THIE LAME DEGREE OF PURITY AS THAT OF OTHER FITUATIONS  AT FIRFI AN ANFWER TO THIS IMPORTANT QUEFTION MAY FECIN DIFFICULT BUT FOME EXAMINATION OF THE CIRCUINFTANCES AT TENDING THE FITUATION OF MARFHES ENABLES UIS TO ACCOUNT FOR IT IN A VERY FATISFAAORY MANNER IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT IN MY TRIALS XWITH MUD THE AIR WAS CONFINED TUNDER GLAFS VEF FELS OVER WATER CONFEQUENTLY NO CIRCUMFTANCES FROM WITH OUT COULD HAVE ANY INFLUENCE ON THE EXPERIMENTS THE AIR OVER MARFHY FITUATIONS IS VERY DIFFERENT IT POFFEFFES ALL THE ADVANTAGES OF VENTILATION C IN COMMON WITH THE AT MOFPHERE BEFIDES THEFE CIRCUMFIANCES A LARGE QUANTITR OF OXYGEN GAS IS AFFORDED BY THE LIVING VEGETABLES WHICH FURROUND THEM IN ABUNDANCE WE MAY ALFO OBFERVE THAT FREQUENTLY LARGE PONDS OF WIRATER ARE FOUND IN

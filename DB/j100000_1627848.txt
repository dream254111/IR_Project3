and Car yle in Britain of Emerson and his group in this country the English mind remained in long isolation from the transitive speculation of Europe originated by Kant and Herder cast abroad by Goethe and systematized by Hegel At length in the sixties of the nine teenth century thanks to Dr Stirling Wal lace the brothers Caird Mr W T Harris and the St Louis circle Hegel burst upon the AngloSaxon world and threatened to carry all before him by the seventies During the same years the hypothesis of evolution to gether with certain discoveriesin physiology and physics brought scientific men into con tact with metaphysical problems which had been stilled awhile Huxleys speculations significant in their changes Cliffords mind stuff and similar socalled monistic theories were the resulta belated product being Haeckels recent Riddle of the Uni verse While the immanent tendencies and animating problems happened to be much the same in both cases it may be declared that the Hegelian and the CliffordHuxley expla nations could not be true together As a matter of fact each emphasized elements incident to the problem which the other minimized A few of the younger men trained like Mr Royce in the idealistic school have come to clear consciousness of this situation and re taining the essential principle for which Hegel stands have striven to rid themselves of his formalistic baggage so affording opportunity for a fuller recognition ofthe scientific stand point andmore importantof the scientific conscience On the whole then these lectures are essentially mediating This constitutes their strength now and will prove their weak ness twenty years hence They cleave to the idealistic as opposed to the monistic solu tion On this ground I have no fault to find with them At the same time I am by no means satis fied that the implications of monism have been threshed out thoroughly even if the dis cussion differ widely as it does from such cavalier treatment as that accorded say by N S VOL XV No 374 Professor Pringle Pattison in the new Dic tionary of Philosophy Moreover I have very serious misgivings about the evident reversion to Fichte manifested by Mr Royce Never theless his lectures constitute a thoroughly characteristic contributionone that cannot be overlookedto the very meaningful de velopment within the English subHegelian school And if Mr Royce appear to look back more than Mr F H Bradley or Mr Ellis McTaggart one must perhaps hold the lectureform of his work partly responsible I am still haunted by the idea to which I have given expression more than once that it is a real misfortune that Mr Royce should have produced so extended a series of books domin ated by this method For as he himself says In the public lectureroom the hearer has no time to meditate and the speaker too little opportunity to be either concise or exhaustive We await the system therefore Like little girls we believe in the man in the moon but like older girls we would believe more in the man in the honeymoon R M WENLEY UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES Popular Science Monthly for February is of more than usual interest for the general read er The first article on Stellar Evolution in the Light of Recent Research by George E Hale shows how much knowledge has been gained by the use of the camera and spectro scope In Winged Reptiles S W Williston tells of the pterodactyls and particularly of the great American toothless species of the genus Ornithostema which includes the larg est flying animals Appropriately following this is The Journeyings of Birds by F H Knowlton which gives an excellent resume of the subject of bird migration and Otis T Mason discusses Environment in Relation to Sex in Human Culture and R H Thurston in The College Man as Leader in the Worlds Work expresses his belief that the educated man will in the future be even more in the front than now Charles B Dyke treats of Theology versus Thrift in the Black Belt believingthat the religious teaching receivedSCIENCE by the average negro is apt to make him care little for the things of this world and is thus a drawback to him while Lindley M Keasbey intimates in The Descent of Man that his physical inferiority to beasts of prey acted as a stimulus to his brain The Osprey for January begins a new series in a new garb with new type It contains The California Jay by D A Cohen Ran dom and Reminiscent Maine Bird Notes by W C Kendall August Birds of Stony Man Mountain Virginia by William Palmer and a review of the Life and Ornithological La bors of Sir John Richardson by Theodore Gill A review of Animals of the Past in cludes reproductions of the restorations of Phorochacos Archceopteryx and Hesperornis Also in the form of a supplement we have the first part of a General History of Birds starting with an interesting history of the etymology of bird The Museums Journal of Great Britain for January under the title The Man as Mu seumCurator has an appreciative notice of Dr G Brown Goode in a review by F A Bather of the memorial volume published by the Smithsonian Institution There is also a good article On the Arrangement of Miner alogical Collections by J G Goodchild and notes on New Zealand Museums and Oxford Museums besides a long list of General Notes which as a rule constitute a most if not the most interesting portion of scientific period icals SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE CHICAGO SECTION OF THE AMERICAN MATHEMATICAL SOCIETY THE tenth regular meeting of the Section was held at Northwestern University Evans ton Illinois on January 2 and 3 1902 Four sessions were devoted to the reading and dis cussion of the following papers 1 Professor M W HASKELL A fundamental theorem in the geometry of the tetrahedron 2 Professor M W HASKELL A theorem for the twisted cubic analogous to Pascals theorem 3 Professor M W HASKELL A special cubic transformation in space 349 4 Professor H S WHITE Note on a twisted curve connected with an involution of pairs of points in a plane 5 Dr J W GLOVER On the derivation of the asymptotes of an algebraic curve from the definition preliminary communication 6 Professor ARNOLD EMCH Algebraic trans formations of a complex variable realized by link ages 7 Professor L W DOWLING On the con formal representation of the isosceles triangle con taining an angle of 120 degrees 8 Professor E H MOORE On Hilberts plane desarguesian geometry 9 Dr F R MOULTON A simple nondesar guesian geometry 10 Dr JACOB WESTLUND  Note on multiply ing perfect numbers 11 Dr JACOB WESTLUND On the class num ber of a particular cyclotomic numberfield 12 Dr CHARLES L BOUTTON The equiva lence of linear differential equations for a trans formation of the independent variable 13 Dr T P HALL An algebra of space 14 Professor J B SHAW Commutivity of matrices and application to the theory of linear associative algebra 15 Dr H G KEPPEL A cubic threeway locus in fourfold space 16 Dr J C FIELDS An equivalent of Pliickers formulae 17 Professor H B NEWSON On the product of linear substitutions 18 Professor G A MILLER On the groups of order pm which contain operators of order pm2 19 Professor L E DICKSON Some sim plifications in the theory of linear groups A topic of a more distinctly pedagogical character was introduced by Professor Town send namely the question of uniformity in the requirements for the Masters degree where mathematics is the major subject and the al lied question of equivalent credits for students migrating from one institution to another After some discussion the matter was referred to a committee for report at the next meeting of the Section An enjoyable feature of the meeting was the dinner served in one of the UTniversity buildings to the members present and followed by an exhibition by Dr Keppel of about fifty portraits of eminent mathema ticians FEBRUARY 28 1902

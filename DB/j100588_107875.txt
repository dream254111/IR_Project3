objectglasses submitted to the test of experiment By PETER BARLOW Esq F R S Mem Imp Ac Petrop c Read May 3 1827 i IT is very remarkable since the achromatic telescope is altogether of English origin that in no one of our separate optical treatises are to be found specific rules for its con struction fitted for the use of practical opticians Some essays of this kind have indeed been attempted the first of which is found in MARTINS  New Elements of Optics published in 1751 but the principle there adopted is erro neous and of course the deductions although possessing a great appearance of simplicity are wholly useless Under the article Telescope in the Encyclopaedia Britannica is another essay of this kind which is correct in principle but far from possessing the degree of simplicity which is desira ble for practical purposes Under the like article in Reess Cyclopaedia is a treatise on the same subject which may be considered wholly prac tical it is founded however upon MARTINS method but corrected by an empyrical multiplier which answers remark ably well in many instances but is erroneous in all extraor dinary cases Lastly an elaborate and highly scientific investigation re lative to these constructions was published by Mr HERSCHEL232 Mr BARLOW on the rules andprinciplesfor in the Phil Trans for 1821 to which I shall refer more at length in a subsequent page These I believe constitute every attempt that has been made in this country to bring the strict laws of optics applicable to these cases within the reach of numerical calculation More numerous attempts have been made by foreign mathematicians but as far as my knowledge of them extends they have in no instance been attended with the success that might have been expected from the deservedly high reputa tion of their authors I have spoken above principally of the methods of deter mining the radii of curvature of the lenses but in order to enter upon this calculation certain data are necessary which require previous experiments and tedious numerical compu tations so that upon the whole to take two specimens of glass of unknown indices and dispersions to form an object glass of them free from colour and spherical aberration requires very formidable calculations involving in them according to the best methods yet employed certain princi ples and operations which we ought hardly to expect practical opticians to be masters of At all events every simplifica tion that can be thrown into experiments and calculations of this kind must be desirable and I am greatly in hopes it will be found that I have in the following pages contributed  Since this Paper was written Mr HESCHEL has also published in the Ency clopedia Metropolitana under the article LIGHT a still more extended investiga tion relative to this and other optical subjects to which article it will likewise be necessary for me to refer as we proceed and if after all any reference should be omitted which ought to be made it must be attributed to this Paper having been written before the publication of the formerdetermining the dispersive ratio of glass c a little towards this object Probably also the immediate comparison of the computed results with experiments on a large scale will add a value to this Paper which it might not otherwise have been thought to possess and for which I am indebted to Messrs W and T GILBERT who very libe rally engaged to submit to the test of experiments any theoretical deductions I might be led to in an investigation of these subjects On the determination of the index of refraction 2 The following method of determining the index of refraction by means of a lens is not given as new it has on the contrary been long practised but as it forms the foundation of the method for determining the dispersive ratio and will occupy but a few lines I shall be excused for introducing it into this Paper It is simply this since by knowing the radii of curvature of a lens and its index of refraction we may compute the focal length so conversely by knowing the radii and measur ing the focal length we may compute the indexof refraction The method which we employed for measuring the focal length of a lens was as follows a tube about 22 inches in diameter and which exactly measured io inches from the back of the lens to its other extremity was fitted with a draw tube of the same length graduated to inches and tenths and which by means of a vernier might be read to the hundredth of an inch This was fitted with a positive eyepiece which was adjustable to bring the cross wires exactly into its focus and the graduations abovenamed commenced from this MDCCCXXVII H h 23SMr BARLOW on the rules andprinciples for point or stop A board about two feet square covered with black crape and having a clean circular piece of card paper with fine cross lines upon it was placed at a convenient measured distance from the lens and then the draw tube was adjusted till we had the focus exactly coincident with the cross wires This is easily ascertained by moving the eye a very little upwards and downwards Then when the image does not fall exactly on the wires this motion of the eye will produce an apparent motion between the cross wires on the telescope and those on the card but when they are coinci dent then however the eye may be moved the image and the cross wires will be at rest This being determined the focal length for this distance of the object is read off as above described Let this focal length bef the distance d radii r r and index 1  a then by a simple inversion of the well known formula for the focal length of a lens we have rr I I I a r  r f  d But as for these experimental purposes we made the radii equal or r  r this formula became simply in this case a     I The only possible source of error this method involves is in the measurement of the tools but this from repeated experiments we found might always be determined to within less than a five hundredth part of the radius which can only affect the result to the amount of about o1th part of the index 234determining the dispersive ratio of glass c Method of determining the dispersive ratio 3 The instrument employed for this purpose is similar to that used for determining the index except that the tube instead of being only ten inches in length consists of three joints one 20 inches and two others io inches each the draw tube being about 14 inches long graduated as before so that the length may be conveniently varied between 20 and o5 inches The cell which carries one of the lenses at the extremity of this tube screws inside flush with the tube itself and will thus admit another tube about o2 inches long to slide over it at the extremity of the latter is another cell for carrying the plate lens This exterior tube is moved over the other by means of a tangent screw and handle with HooKs universal joint as in the adjustment of transit and other instruments Moreover the exterior tube being opened for the space of two inches and the interior tube graduated the distance of the two lenses from each other may always be read off to the hun dredth of an inch The instrument being thus described the method of using it and the principle on which the determination rests will be readily understood It is well known that in order to produce  I am not aware that this very simple method of determining dispersive ratios has been before practically employed but it is suggested by Mr HERSCHEL in his recent article refered to in a former page He deduces it from considerations relative to the achromaticity when the two lenses of an objectglass are placed at a distance from each other his primary object being to complete any trifling want of correction by a change of distance My views were not very dissimilar and our resulting equations although differently expressed are of course equivalent 235Mr BARLOW on the rules and principles for achromatism in an object glass it is requisite that the focal lengths of the two lenses be to each other in the ratio of their dispersive powers that is the ratio of the dispersive power of the flint being to that of the plate as  d the focal length of the flint must be to that of the plate also as  d the two lenses being in contact If therefore we have two lenses viz a concave flint and a convex plate in which the focal length of the latter bears a greater ratio to that of the former than i to d we must open the two lenses from each other till the required ratio is ob tained when the object will be colourless and therefore conversely when the image is colourless we shall be sure that the ratio of the focal lengths will be that also of the dispersive powers To illustrate this a little more particularly let f f be the focal lengths of the plate and flint lens and let a be the distance of the lenses when the image is colourless Then first it is obvious that the effect will be the same as if we had a plate lens in contact with the flint which had for its focal length f d but the actual quantity of its dispersion that due to the whole focal lengthf that is the same as a plate lens of focal lengthf   and whose dispersive power fd  And since in this state the image is colourless it follows that ff  x  f f And therefore d which is the quantity sought is found from the equation th    2 The lenses we employed were about 2g inches in diameter 36determining the dispersive ratio of glass c equally convex in the plate and plano concave in the flint their focal lengths varying in the plate and crown from 92 to lo inches according to their respective refractive indices and in the flint from about lo to I 1 inches 4 The flint lens as will have been observed from the pre ceding description is placed in the interior tube and the plate in the exterior and if when the two interior faces of the lenses are in contact the index does not read zero its actual reading is recorded and ultimately the index reading when the image is colourless is corrected by this quantity This preliminary being attended to the manner of con ducting the experiments is as follows Fix up the black board with the circular white spot as already described at a convenient distance and in a good light directly opposite the tube properly mounted on its stand Let the two lenses be placed nearly in contact and suppose the length of the tube reduced to about 20 inches Now move the plate lens gently forward by means of the handle and screw the eye being placed at the eyeglass and the image of the circular spot will after a time begin to appear in the field of the telescope having a bright and strong violet spot in the middle at this time a very little farther motion in the plate lens will give a distinct image of the object but encircled by a strong violet shade If now the tube be lengthened to about 25 inches and the experiment repeated by closing the glasses the violet spot in the middle and the circular ring when the focus is obtained will have changed to a fine blue If again we lengthen the  The different thicknesses of the lenses render the correction necessary 27ss8 Mr BARLOW on the rules and principles for tube considerably that is to nearly 50 inches we shall find by repeating the experiment that is by closing still more the two glasses that the circular spot before the image is formed and the surrounding atmosphere when the focus is obtained will be red orange or yellow and between these extremes a focal length will be found where the circular spot in the middle will lose all distinguishing colour showing itself a bright white and when in the focus the image will be colourless although surrounded by a visible atmosphere principally proceeding from a want of spherical correction At this time the glasses are corrected for dispersion and the compound focal length measured from the back of the flint and the distance of the glasses must be accurately read off and with these data the dispersion may be obtained by the formulae already given viz d f  2 In this expressionf is the focal length of the plate lens for the given object andf the focal length of the flint for parallel rays The former may be found by direct observation with the index instrument as already described but the latter is best determined by means of the compound focus that is calling the compound focus f we shall have 1 1 I and f being thus determined is to be employed in the pre ceding formula As an example suppose the compound focus measured from the flint to be 3489 inches the

85sxi3  91 the dispersive ratio sought On the computation of the radiifor correcting spherical aberration and colour 5 We have seen that to render an objectglass achromatic it is only necessary to have the focal lengths in the direct ratio of the dispersive power of the two glasses Let this ratio be i  d then representing the compound focal length by f we shall have f  f   d  focal length of plate f  fi d   focal length of flint And these focal lengths without any other condition will give a compound focal length f and produce achromatic correction Let i 4 a  index of plate 1  a index of flint r r the radii of curvature in the plate r r those of the flint The order of the radii reckoned from the object side being r r r r the two former being convex and the latter concave unless the contrary be stated Then by a known formula we shall have I I I r r a 1 I r fI N  r fa 239240 Mr BARROW on the rules and principles for Here then are four quantities to be determined and only two equations so that if the condition of being achromatic was the only one we might have any variety of answers at pleasure but it is also required that the objectglass shall be free from spherical aberration which is still only a third condition and therefore even with this the question may still be considered as admitting of various solutions But a fourth condition may be that the two interior surfaces shall be either actually equal or very nearly so And this last con dition serves to bring the solution within very narrow limits although it is still not strictly limited unless we insist upon perfect contact surfaces or some other specific condition Mr HERSCHEL in his very elaborate and valuable Paper on this subject in the Phil Trans Part II 1821 instead of this last condition has taken another viz  the destruction of aberration not only for parallel rays but also for rays diverg ing from a point at any finite distance The resulting equations by the introduction of this condi tion make the radii of the two interior surfaces nearly equal but in several cases the convex side is the deeper and the two surfaces therefore ride in the middle unless separated at the edges by paper or some other substance interposed between them which by many practical opticians is considered objectionable The contact surfaces are also in this construc tion deeper and the actual quantity of aberration in either lens to be corrected is greater than would otherwise be ne cessary Moreover by insisting upon any fourth condition  Mr HERSCHEL suggests that the best way would be in all cases to frame each lens into a separate cell and to adjust them to each other by screws In this case of course it would be indifferent which of the two were the deeper surfacedetermining the dispersive ratio of glass c equally rigid with the other three the workman is restricted to a very exact accordance in the measure of all his four tools and it leaves him no opportunity of matching a good flint lens with a plate or a plate with a flint which is in many cases a desirable convenience I have not therefore insisted rigidly upon a fourth condition but have made this subservient to the above convenience by only requiring that the contact surfaces shall be either exactly or nearly equal and the concave the deeper when there is any difference between them The optician is thus enabled to make a choice within certain limits of the radii of one of his lenses and has only to match the other to it By this means the intricate equation arising out of the fourth condition is avoided I am quite aware that in this way a great sacrifice is made of ana lytical elegance but as my object has been to bring the calculation fully within the reach of such practical opticians as have no pretensions to a knowledge of analysis I have prefered a simple although somewhat indirect method of computation to one more direct and refined but at the same time more intricate and laborious The principle here pro posed will be illustrated in the following paragraphs The investigation of the aberration produced at one spheri cal surface is found in most of our optical treatises and need not therefore be repeated in this place of these ex pressions that which is given in WOODS Optics art 397 is perhaps one of the most simple I shall therefore adopt this and refer the reader to the work itself for the investigation Let d be the distance of a radiant point from a spherical convex surface of a denser medium whose radius is r and semidiameter y let also the sine of incidence to the sine of MDcccxxVI I i 241242 Mr BARLOW on the rules and principles for refraction be as i to i  a that is let the refractive index be i  a then it is shown in the work above quoted that the aberration in this medium will be adr d a  r y P adr a I d X 2r  4 This expression is for the case of diverging rays on a con vex surface of a denser medium but it will apply to the case of a concave surface by merely changing all the signs of r For parallel rays d must be considered infinite and for con verging rays d must be taken negative so that this expres sion is general in all cases where the rays enter a denser medium When the rays pass from a dense to a rare medium the ratio is i  a  but this to be rendered symmetrical must be reduced to 11 b where b    substituting there fore in the above every where  b for a we obtain for the case of diverging rays on a convex spherical surface bd rX d  2 br Y1 P bdrz X Ibd x 2r And the expression for converging rays on a concave surface is precisely the same except in the sign of the last factor because both d and r changing from positive to negative leave the expression precisely the same with the above ex ception it becomes therefore in this case bdr1 d z brd y Pr bdrX ibd x b  5 merely writing d and r for d and r for the sake of distin guishing between the two formule 7 Now in order to find the aberration of a lens as caused by the refraction at the second surface which is equivalent to the rays falling upon the spherical surface of a rarerdetermining the dispersive ratio ofglass c e4 medium the latter expression must be employed in which therefore d is not in efinite as in the former case but is dependent upon the refraction at the first surface of the lens being the distance to which the rays converge in con sequence of that refraction d therefore in this case by a well known expression for the focus of the rays at one surface is d adr  6 d  adr 6 Where d must be taken positive or negative accordingly as the rays first diverge or converge and r must be positive or negative as the first surface is convex or concave and this value of d substituted in equation 5 will give that part of the aberration which depends upon the rays impinging on the second surface But there is also another part depending upon the aberration of the first surface for as the rays in consequence of the first aberration do not all converge to the distance d whereas we have computed the second case as if they did there will be an aberration on that account Let the aberration produced at the first surface be x then the consequent aberration at the second surface will be WooDs Optics Art 405 X X bdt r And hence the entire aberration produced with diverging rays by a convex lens from a distance d the radii being r r

tion of a lens receiving parallel rays the indirect method by which an equal and contrary aberration in the two lenses is produced may be thus described 34454G6 Mr BARLOW on the rules and principles for Since when the aberration in the flint lens is so propor tioned as to counteract that of the plate all the rays converge to the mean focal point so conversely if we suppose rays emanating from that focal point they will have precisely the reverse route after their refraction at the flint lens to that which they have when they are converging towards it in an opposite direction from the plate lens consequently the aber ration of the flint lens for rays emanating from the mean or compound focus must be equal to the aberration from the plate lens for parallel rays in the opposite direction And in the former case when the amount of aberration has been ascertained this will be also that due to the latter whence the ratio of the surfaces which will produce this aberration or the value of q may be computed by means of the general quadratic equation 8 or the particular equation belonging to the given plate index Hence we may proceed as follows 1 First to compute the aberration of the flint lens for rays assumed to emanatefrom the compoundfocalpoint Here the distance f index i  a dispersion  d and let the radii of the surfaces for distinction sake be r r and the ratio of r  r  1  q

concave or convex accordingly as q is positive or negative It is to be observed however that if in these results r should be less than r or if it should exceed it too much so as to leave the contact surfaces too wide a new supposition of the value of q must be made till the required approxima tion stated in our fourth condition art 6 is obtained 12 It fortunately happens that the most laborious part of the above operation viz the solution of the equation from which the value of q in the plate lens is obtained is readily reduced to a tabulated form whereby this calculation is alto gether avoided This is done in the following short table in which all the more practicable values of q are given for the several indices a 500 a 510 a 520 and a  530 and it will be seen that so little change takes place in the value of q for these changes of indices that the number answering to any value of a between these limits may be readily found by simple proportion In this Table p represents the amount of aberration as determined by equation 14 and in the adjacent column is given the corresponding value of q as to the method of using the table it will be readily comprehended from an example

Mr TULLY 1t According to the description we lhave under the article Telescope in REEss Cyclopedia of the principle of computa tion adopted by this ingenious optician it appears that instead of computing the aberration of the flint lens from the focal point it is calculated for parallel rays and always for the index 15oo the formula made use of being 27  6q7 as first given by HUYGENS This must necessarily give an erroneous result and to correct it a comparison of various experiments has led to the formation of an empirical multi plier which is said to compensate for the erroneous supposi tion and to have formed the ground work of the practice of this able artistMr BARLOW on the rules and principles for Thus for example having first computed the focal lengths of the two lenses we must according to these directions assume any ratio at least within practicable limits for the radii of the surfaces of the plate viz q  7 then by the above formula find the value of p Call now p the aber ration of the flint lens computed by the same formula then independent of the correction above alluded to we should have P P p a a Jf  fa or fa P X da But the value of p thus found as might be expected does not produce a good objectglass and from experiment it was ascertained that the best effect was obtained when the multiplier instead of a was made equal to aVa p therefore is found by this formula a a ca13 X daVa3 Then substituting this value of p in the equation   27 q  6 q  7 P 6 q  I2 the value of q is obtained and hence of course the radii sought Now although this may furnish a very good approximation in some cases it seems likely that it must in others deviate very considerably from the truth I was desirous therefore of comparing the results obtained by this empirical formula with those of the correct numbers as above determined and also to ascertain experimentally within what limits we might be in error without producing a sensible change in the cor rection of the objectglass and through the assistance of 52Bdetermining the dispersive ratio of glass c 253 Messrs W and T GILBERT I have been enabled to make various experiments some of the most useful of which I will endeavour to describe First however let us ascertain what multiplier we should require according to the practice we are speaking of in the particular example computed in a preceding page i6 Assuming our plate lens such as we have found it viz having r  io66  q this gives 27 qo  6 q  7 P 6 q i  1725 and the multiplier  a ad  218 Now the aberration of our flint which theoretically cor rects the aberration of this plate computed by this formula viz by taking q  10 is 27 q2  6 q  8 7 p 6  1 3811  whence p  72  2209 I 7z5 The empirical rule therefore approaches extremely near in its result in this case to that obtained on strict optical principles and in several other comparisons I have made the agreement has been found equally close although in others it differs too widely to be depended upon and as the rule which I have given is strictly correct and involves no greater difficulty of calculation than that we have been ex amining there can I think be no doubt to which the pre ference should be given in any practical case of this kindMr BARLOW on the rules and principles for Experimental examination of the limits within which an error in spherical aberration and dispersion may have place without producing a sensible defect in the objectglass 17 Although I feel convinced that the method we em ployed for measuring a tool would give us a true result within Toth part of the radius yet it by no means follows that a new tool can be made within the same limits to meet any computed radius In fact if all the accuracy of radii were requisite which the strict theory requires it would be almost impossible to construct an objectglass that would bear a practical examination fortunately however this is not the case some scope may be allowed without any very sensible change in the performance of the telescope and to ascertain within what limits it was necessary to confine the error was the object of the following experiments Experiment 1 18 According to the preceding computation art 14 we ought to have for an 80 inch focus the following curves  the index of the flint being 1600o of the plate ix5i5 and dis persion 66 viz r  28 91  Y plate  27 jpaecompound focus 80

these instead of 2719 and 271 9 the first surface to be renderel proportional ought to have been 28o05 and the focus 777 inches instealt of 80 inches A new tool was made for the first surface but on measurement it turned out to be 84 viz 35 of an inch tco long We determined however to proceed with these radii viz 28 4 264 1  plate 6  flint Focus 779 inches 64J 2 64 J The glass being accurately ground to these numbers and well centred the result was satisfactory the spherical aber ration appeared to be very perfectly balanced although the actual amount of the aberration of the plate lens in conse quence of the excess of the first surface was 1 738 instead of 1730 The focal lengths now also answered to a dis persion d 664 instead of 660 and yet the correction for colour appeared perfect It is clear therefore that an error to the amount here stated may exist between the computed and the practical radii without producing any sensible detri ment to the effect of the instrument The plate was now reversed carefully adjusted and the observation repeated The achromatic correction of course was still perfect and the spherical aberration seemed also tolerably well balanced although the actual amount of the aberration of the plate was now only 1r6 instead of 173 The preference however appeared obviously to belong to the first arrangement Experiment 2 19 In order to ascertain the e fect of a known want of achromatic correction a plate was employed which had beenMr BARLoW on the rules and principles for ground to 26A4 and so inches so that the arrangement was now r s30o 1 r  2641

spherical aberration The plate was reversed but the focus and colour of course remained the same as did also the general appearance As far as spherical aberration was concerned that of the flint was obviously overcorrected in one case and undercorrected in the other but the defect was too much buried in the colour to enable us to distinguish the difference Exper4mnent s wo Messrs GILBERT having by them a concave flint lens of the same glass to the radii 284 and 264 this was matched with the last plate the curves were therefore now r esr as  84q r s0 plate r 64 flint which proportions answer to a dispersion 638 about as much in defect as the preceding one was in excess And it was found to have the same general defect but the colour was now of course yellow Whatever the limits of error may be therefore that can be admitted with impunity they must be far less than those in the last two experiments s56determining the dispersive ratio of glass c Experiment 4 el Here our flint lens was one

no doubt I believe could be entertained relative to either principle of computa tion yet it was highly pleasing to me to see so close an agreement in the results of two numerical processes founded on such widely different bases 24 In these numbers however we have an example of the inconvenience to which I have referred p 24o of rigidly enforcing a fourth condition for the concave of the flint being less deep than the corresponding plate convex radius it was thought necessary to alter these numbers this was done by changing r  666 to r  658 and r  650 to r  661 which was the least alteration we could make in the contact surfaces to have the concave the deeper of the two the other radii were necessarily altered to r l9o and r  325 so that our actual experimental radii were r19o l r 658 r 661 r 325 the focal length and dispersive ratio that is the ratio of the eSI9Mr BARLOW on the rules and principlesfor focal lengths being thus very exactly the same as required by the conditions of the problem The lenses ground to these numbers turned out very fine the surface centering c was also very perfect and the result notwithstanding the discrepances between the com puted and actual radii employed was very satisfactory The scale of the experiment was however too small the diameter of the lens being only 2 inches so that the defect of correction for aberration was not very sensible but in several other subsequent experiments with very nearly the same proportional numbers for focal lengths of 5 6 and 7 feet with proportional apertures the want of correct balance in the spherical correction was very manifest It seems therefore that we may in some cases deviate from the radii given by theory much more than in others without producing the same defect in the instrument and it will be seen that this ought a priori to be expected We know that the amount of aberration the focal length aperture c being given varies with the ratio of the surfaces and is least in the plate lens for all the usual indices for parallel rays when r  r 1  6 and is very little increased with the ratio of 1   all those results therefore which require a ratio comprised within or near these limits will have but a small quantity of aberration in the plate lens to be corrected by the flint lens but when we employ such numbers as require a ratio of 3 to i or 4 to 1 in the plate then the aber ration to be corrected by the flint is very considerable and a small discrepance between the computed and practical radii will produce a much greater error than the same discrepances would in the former instance and to this circumstance I attri 260determining the dispersive ratio of glass c bute the difficulty which we certainly found in submitting Mr HERSCHELS numbers to practice Nothing can be desired more accurate nor more elegant than the principles and the analysis on which it is founded nor any thing more simple than the ultimate result but it happens that except the most rigid agreement has place between the computed radii and the radii employed the discrepance has a very considerable effect upon the correction of the objectglass The rule which I have endeavoured to explain in the pre ceding pages is I believe equally correct but it possesses none of the elegance of investigation which distinguishes the other To compensate for this however it has an extensive range of application and will enable us in all cases to select those particular radii which will produce the required cor rection with the least liability to error and with the closest contact surfaces We may also by rejecting the latter con dition match any flint whatsoever with its proper plate which is I believe a great practical convenience The above are only a few out of a great number of expe riments but I have selected them so that they embrace all the varieties which can ever occur viz with the flint double concave when q is positive with the flint planoconcave when q is infinite and with it concavoconvex when q is negative So that I hope no one who has any knowledge of the meaning of an algebraical formula can be at any loss in submitting the rules I have endeavoured to illustrate to a practical application 26lMr BARLOW on the rules and principles for Approximate method of computing the curves for an achromatic objectglass 25 On refering to the formula  4 for finding the value of p it will be seen that the first term which expresses the aberration due to the aberration at the first surface is very inconsiderable with respect to the other term and that the former may be omitted in all common cases without produc ing any sensible error This omission serves to contract the operation very considerably while by a simple inspection of the table art 13 it will be seen that its several columns are so nearly the same that any mean one may be adopted instead of the whole availing ourselves of this circumstance every rule and principle for constructing an objectglass may be comprised in the following short synopsis and the result may be used with every degree of confidence in all ordinary cases although in large telescopes and in cases where the index and dispersions are very extraordinary it will be necessary to employ the exact formula already illustrated According to the approximation here alluded to the rules for the computation may be stated

refraction and the curvature of the surfaces of any given convex or concave lens 26 It is frequently convenient for a practical optician to be enabled to determine the radii of curvature of a given lens and I am not aware of any rule being given for this purpose the following therefore may be acceptable The method of measuring the radii of a given concave lens is very well known it is simply to measure the reflected solar focus of each of the two surfaces then double these numbers will be the radii sought The same simplicity of calculation does not present itself in the convex lens still however the following method of deducing the radii will be found by no means difficult Obtain as in the case of the concave lens the focus by reflection from the back surface of the convex lens exposing first one surface and then the other to the solar rays mea sure also accurately the solar focal length of the lens by refraction and then by means of these three quantities equations may be formed which will give the radii of curva ture and index of refraction Let r r be the radii of curvature of the two surfaces and i 4 x the index of refraction let the lens be exposed to the suns rays so that the latter are first received upon the surface r Then by known optical principles the refracted focus at the first surface will be e may now therefore disregarding the thickness of the We may now therefore disregarding the thickness of the 264determining the dispersive ratio of glass c lens consider these rays as converging towards the back surface to a focus f and from this surface a part of them will be reflected to a focus J which will be expressed by fr  2r  This by substituting for f its preceding value and making y xL becomes t  r r  r I  X   v e 2 r  y rr r zrr These rays will be

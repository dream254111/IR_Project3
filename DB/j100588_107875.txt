OBJECTGLASSES SUBMITTED TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT,I206982,L 231 J XV RULES AND PRINCZPLES FOR DETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS AND FOR COMPUTING THE RADII OF CURVATURE FOR ACHROMATIC OBJECTGLASSES SUBMITTED TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT BY PETER BARLOW ESQ F R S MEM IMP AC PETROP C READ MAY 3 1827 I IT IS VERY REMARKABLE SINCE THE ACHROMATIC TELESCOPE IS ALTOGETHER OF ENGLISH ORIGIN THAT IN NO ONE OF OUR SEPARATE OPTICAL TREATISES ARE TO BE FOUND SPECIFIC RULES FOR ITS CON STRUCTION FITTED FOR THE USE OF PRACTICAL OPTICIANS SOME ESSAYS OF THIS KIND HAVE INDEED BEEN ATTEMPTED THE FIRST OF WHICH IS FOUND IN MARTINS  NEW ELEMENTS OF OPTICS PUBLISHED IN 1751 BUT THE PRINCIPLE THERE ADOPTED IS ERRO NEOUS AND OF COURSE THE DEDUCTIONS ALTHOUGH POSSESSING A GREAT APPEARANCE OF SIMPLICITY ARE WHOLLY USELESS UNDER THE ARTICLE TELESCOPE IN THE ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA IS ANOTHER ESSAY OF THIS KIND WHICH IS CORRECT IN PRINCIPLE BUT FAR FROM POSSESSING THE DEGREE OF SIMPLICITY WHICH IS DESIRA BLE FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES UNDER THE LIKE ARTICLE IN REESS CYCLOPAEDIA IS A TREATISE ON THE SAME SUBJECT WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED WHOLLY PRAC TICAL IT IS FOUNDED HOWEVER UPON MARTINS METHOD BUT CORRECTED BY AN EMPYRICAL MULTIPLIER WHICH ANSWERS REMARK ABLY WELL IN MANY INSTANCES BUT IS ERRONEOUS IN ALL EXTRAOR DINARY CASES LASTLY AN ELABORATE AND HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC INVESTIGATION RE LATIVE TO THESE CONSTRUCTIONS WAS PUBLISHED BY MR HERSCHEL232 MR BARLOW ON THE RULES ANDPRINCIPLESFOR IN THE PHIL TRANS FOR 1821 TO WHICH I SHALL REFER MORE AT LENGTH IN A SUBSEQUENT PAGE THESE I BELIEVE CONSTITUTE EVERY ATTEMPT THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THIS COUNTRY TO BRING THE STRICT LAWS OF OPTICS APPLICABLE TO THESE CASES WITHIN THE REACH OF NUMERICAL CALCULATION MORE NUMEROUS ATTEMPTS HAVE BEEN MADE BY FOREIGN MATHEMATICIANS BUT AS FAR AS MY KNOWLEDGE OF THEM EXTENDS THEY HAVE IN NO INSTANCE BEEN ATTENDED WITH THE SUCCESS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED FROM THE DESERVEDLY HIGH REPUTA TION OF THEIR AUTHORS I HAVE SPOKEN ABOVE PRINCIPALLY OF THE METHODS OF DETER MINING THE RADII OF CURVATURE OF THE LENSES BUT IN ORDER TO ENTER UPON THIS CALCULATION CERTAIN DATA ARE NECESSARY WHICH REQUIRE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS AND TEDIOUS NUMERICAL COMPU TATIONS SO THAT UPON THE WHOLE TO TAKE TWO SPECIMENS OF GLASS OF UNKNOWN INDICES AND DISPERSIONS TO FORM AN OBJECT GLASS OF THEM FREE FROM COLOUR AND SPHERICAL ABERRATION REQUIRES VERY FORMIDABLE CALCULATIONS INVOLVING IN THEM ACCORDING TO THE BEST METHODS YET EMPLOYED CERTAIN PRINCI PLES AND OPERATIONS WHICH WE OUGHT HARDLY TO EXPECT PRACTICAL OPTICIANS TO BE MASTERS OF AT ALL EVENTS EVERY SIMPLIFICA TION THAT CAN BE THROWN INTO EXPERIMENTS AND CALCULATIONS OF THIS KIND MUST BE DESIRABLE AND I AM GREATLY IN HOPES IT WILL BE FOUND THAT I HAVE IN THE FOLLOWING PAGES CONTRIBUTED  SINCE THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN MR HESCHEL HAS ALSO PUBLISHED IN THE ENCY CLOPEDIA METROPOLITANA UNDER THE ARTICLE LIGHT A STILL MORE EXTENDED INVESTIGA TION RELATIVE TO THIS AND OTHER OPTICAL SUBJECTS TO WHICH ARTICLE IT WILL LIKEWISE BE NECESSARY FOR ME TO REFER AS WE PROCEED AND IF AFTER ALL ANY REFERENCE SHOULD BE OMITTED WHICH OUGHT TO BE MADE IT MUST BE ATTRIBUTED TO THIS PAPER HAVING BEEN WRITTEN BEFORE THE PUBLICATION OF THE FORMERDETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS C A LITTLE TOWARDS THIS OBJECT PROBABLY ALSO THE IMMEDIATE COMPARISON OF THE COMPUTED RESULTS WITH EXPERIMENTS ON A LARGE SCALE WILL ADD A VALUE TO THIS PAPER WHICH IT MIGHT NOT OTHERWISE HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO POSSESS AND FOR WHICH I AM INDEBTED TO MESSRS W AND T GILBERT WHO VERY LIBE RALLY ENGAGED TO SUBMIT TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENTS ANY THEORETICAL DEDUCTIONS I MIGHT BE LED TO IN AN INVESTIGATION OF THESE SUBJECTS ON THE DETERMINATION OF THE INDEX OF REFRACTION 2 THE FOLLOWING METHOD OF DETERMINING THE INDEX OF REFRACTION BY MEANS OF A LENS IS NOT GIVEN AS NEW IT HAS ON THE CONTRARY BEEN LONG PRACTISED BUT AS IT FORMS THE FOUNDATION OF THE METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO AND WILL OCCUPY BUT A FEW LINES I SHALL BE EXCUSED FOR INTRODUCING IT INTO THIS PAPER IT IS SIMPLY THIS SINCE BY KNOWING THE RADII OF CURVATURE OF A LENS AND ITS INDEX OF REFRACTION WE MAY COMPUTE THE FOCAL LENGTH SO CONVERSELY BY KNOWING THE RADII AND MEASUR ING THE FOCAL LENGTH WE MAY COMPUTE THE INDEXOF REFRACTION THE METHOD WHICH WE EMPLOYED FOR MEASURING THE FOCAL LENGTH OF A LENS WAS AS FOLLOWS A TUBE ABOUT 22 INCHES IN DIAMETER AND WHICH EXACTLY MEASURED IO INCHES FROM THE BACK OF THE LENS TO ITS OTHER EXTREMITY WAS FITTED WITH A DRAW TUBE OF THE SAME LENGTH GRADUATED TO INCHES AND TENTHS AND WHICH BY MEANS OF A VERNIER MIGHT BE READ TO THE HUNDREDTH OF AN INCH THIS WAS FITTED WITH A POSITIVE EYEPIECE WHICH WAS ADJUSTABLE TO BRING THE CROSS WIRES EXACTLY INTO ITS FOCUS AND THE GRADUATIONS ABOVENAMED COMMENCED FROM THIS MDCCCXXVII H H 23SMR BARLOW ON THE RULES ANDPRINCIPLES FOR POINT OR STOP A BOARD ABOUT TWO FEET SQUARE COVERED WITH BLACK CRAPE AND HAVING A CLEAN CIRCULAR PIECE OF CARD PAPER WITH FINE CROSS LINES UPON IT WAS PLACED AT A CONVENIENT MEASURED DISTANCE FROM THE LENS AND THEN THE DRAW TUBE WAS ADJUSTED TILL WE HAD THE FOCUS EXACTLY COINCIDENT WITH THE CROSS WIRES THIS IS EASILY ASCERTAINED BY MOVING THE EYE A VERY LITTLE UPWARDS AND DOWNWARDS THEN WHEN THE IMAGE DOES NOT FALL EXACTLY ON THE WIRES THIS MOTION OF THE EYE WILL PRODUCE AN APPARENT MOTION BETWEEN THE CROSS WIRES ON THE TELESCOPE AND THOSE ON THE CARD BUT WHEN THEY ARE COINCI DENT THEN HOWEVER THE EYE MAY BE MOVED THE IMAGE AND THE CROSS WIRES WILL BE AT REST THIS BEING DETERMINED THE FOCAL LENGTH FOR THIS DISTANCE OF THE OBJECT IS READ OFF AS ABOVE DESCRIBED LET THIS FOCAL LENGTH BEF THE DISTANCE D RADII R R AND INDEX 1  A THEN BY A SIMPLE INVERSION OF THE WELL KNOWN FORMULA FOR THE FOCAL LENGTH OF A LENS WE HAVE RR I I I A R  R F  D BUT AS FOR THESE EXPERIMENTAL PURPOSES WE MADE THE RADII EQUAL OR R  R THIS FORMULA BECAME SIMPLY IN THIS CASE A     I THE ONLY POSSIBLE SOURCE OF ERROR THIS METHOD INVOLVES IS IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE TOOLS BUT THIS FROM REPEATED EXPERIMENTS WE FOUND MIGHT ALWAYS BE DETERMINED TO WITHIN LESS THAN A FIVE HUNDREDTH PART OF THE RADIUS WHICH CAN ONLY AFFECT THE RESULT TO THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT O1TH PART OF THE INDEX 234DETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS C METHOD OF DETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO 3 THE INSTRUMENT EMPLOYED FOR THIS PURPOSE IS SIMILAR TO THAT USED FOR DETERMINING THE INDEX EXCEPT THAT THE TUBE INSTEAD OF BEING ONLY TEN INCHES IN LENGTH CONSISTS OF THREE JOINTS ONE 20 INCHES AND TWO OTHERS IO INCHES EACH THE DRAW TUBE BEING ABOUT 14 INCHES LONG GRADUATED AS BEFORE SO THAT THE LENGTH MAY BE CONVENIENTLY VARIED BETWEEN 20 AND O5 INCHES THE CELL WHICH CARRIES ONE OF THE LENSES AT THE EXTREMITY OF THIS TUBE SCREWS INSIDE FLUSH WITH THE TUBE ITSELF AND WILL THUS ADMIT ANOTHER TUBE ABOUT O2 INCHES LONG TO SLIDE OVER IT AT THE EXTREMITY OF THE LATTER IS ANOTHER CELL FOR CARRYING THE PLATE LENS THIS EXTERIOR TUBE IS MOVED OVER THE OTHER BY MEANS OF A TANGENT SCREW AND HANDLE WITH HOOKS UNIVERSAL JOINT AS IN THE ADJUSTMENT OF TRANSIT AND OTHER INSTRUMENTS MOREOVER THE EXTERIOR TUBE BEING OPENED FOR THE SPACE OF TWO INCHES AND THE INTERIOR TUBE GRADUATED THE DISTANCE OF THE TWO LENSES FROM EACH OTHER MAY ALWAYS BE READ OFF TO THE HUN DREDTH OF AN INCH THE INSTRUMENT BEING THUS DESCRIBED THE METHOD OF USING IT AND THE PRINCIPLE ON WHICH THE DETERMINATION RESTS WILL BE READILY UNDERSTOOD IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT IN ORDER TO PRODUCE  I AM NOT AWARE THAT THIS VERY SIMPLE METHOD OF DETERMINING DISPERSIVE RATIOS HAS BEEN BEFORE PRACTICALLY EMPLOYED BUT IT IS SUGGESTED BY MR HERSCHEL IN HIS RECENT ARTICLE REFERED TO IN A FORMER PAGE HE DEDUCES IT FROM CONSIDERATIONS RELATIVE TO THE ACHROMATICITY WHEN THE TWO LENSES OF AN OBJECTGLASS ARE PLACED AT A DISTANCE FROM EACH OTHER HIS PRIMARY OBJECT BEING TO COMPLETE ANY TRIFLING WANT OF CORRECTION BY A CHANGE OF DISTANCE MY VIEWS WERE NOT VERY DISSIMILAR AND OUR RESULTING EQUATIONS ALTHOUGH DIFFERENTLY EXPRESSED ARE OF COURSE EQUIVALENT 235MR BARLOW ON THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES FOR ACHROMATISM IN AN OBJECT GLASS IT IS REQUISITE THAT THE FOCAL LENGTHS OF THE TWO LENSES BE TO EACH OTHER IN THE RATIO OF THEIR DISPERSIVE POWERS THAT IS THE RATIO OF THE DISPERSIVE POWER OF THE FLINT BEING TO THAT OF THE PLATE AS  D THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE FLINT MUST BE TO THAT OF THE PLATE ALSO AS  D THE TWO LENSES BEING IN CONTACT IF THEREFORE WE HAVE TWO LENSES VIZ A CONCAVE FLINT AND A CONVEX PLATE IN WHICH THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE LATTER BEARS A GREATER RATIO TO THAT OF THE FORMER THAN I TO D WE MUST OPEN THE TWO LENSES FROM EACH OTHER TILL THE REQUIRED RATIO IS OB TAINED WHEN THE OBJECT WILL BE COLOURLESS AND THEREFORE CONVERSELY WHEN THE IMAGE IS COLOURLESS WE SHALL BE SURE THAT THE RATIO OF THE FOCAL LENGTHS WILL BE THAT ALSO OF THE DISPERSIVE POWERS TO ILLUSTRATE THIS A LITTLE MORE PARTICULARLY LET F F BE THE FOCAL LENGTHS OF THE PLATE AND FLINT LENS AND LET A BE THE DISTANCE OF THE LENSES WHEN THE IMAGE IS COLOURLESS THEN FIRST IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE EFFECT WILL BE THE SAME AS IF WE HAD A PLATE LENS IN CONTACT WITH THE FLINT WHICH HAD FOR ITS FOCAL LENGTH F D BUT THE ACTUAL QUANTITY OF ITS DISPERSION THAT DUE TO THE WHOLE FOCAL LENGTHF THAT IS THE SAME AS A PLATE LENS OF FOCAL LENGTHF   AND WHOSE DISPERSIVE POWER FD  AND SINCE IN THIS STATE THE IMAGE IS COLOURLESS IT FOLLOWS THAT FF  X  F F AND THEREFORE D WHICH IS THE QUANTITY SOUGHT IS FOUND FROM THE EQUATION TH    2 THE LENSES WE EMPLOYED WERE ABOUT 2G INCHES IN DIAMETER 36DETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS C EQUALLY CONVEX IN THE PLATE AND PLANO CONCAVE IN THE FLINT THEIR FOCAL LENGTHS VARYING IN THE PLATE AND CROWN FROM 92 TO LO INCHES ACCORDING TO THEIR RESPECTIVE REFRACTIVE INDICES AND IN THE FLINT FROM ABOUT LO TO I 1 INCHES 4 THE FLINT LENS AS WILL HAVE BEEN OBSERVED FROM THE PRE CEDING DESCRIPTION IS PLACED IN THE INTERIOR TUBE AND THE PLATE IN THE EXTERIOR AND IF WHEN THE TWO INTERIOR FACES OF THE LENSES ARE IN CONTACT THE INDEX DOES NOT READ ZERO ITS ACTUAL READING IS RECORDED AND ULTIMATELY THE INDEX READING WHEN THE IMAGE IS COLOURLESS IS CORRECTED BY THIS QUANTITY THIS PRELIMINARY BEING ATTENDED TO THE MANNER OF CON DUCTING THE EXPERIMENTS IS AS FOLLOWS FIX UP THE BLACK BOARD WITH THE CIRCULAR WHITE SPOT AS ALREADY DESCRIBED AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE AND IN A GOOD LIGHT DIRECTLY OPPOSITE THE TUBE PROPERLY MOUNTED ON ITS STAND LET THE TWO LENSES BE PLACED NEARLY IN CONTACT AND SUPPOSE THE LENGTH OF THE TUBE REDUCED TO ABOUT 20 INCHES NOW MOVE THE PLATE LENS GENTLY FORWARD BY MEANS OF THE HANDLE AND SCREW THE EYE BEING PLACED AT THE EYEGLASS AND THE IMAGE OF THE CIRCULAR SPOT WILL AFTER A TIME BEGIN TO APPEAR IN THE FIELD OF THE TELESCOPE HAVING A BRIGHT AND STRONG VIOLET SPOT IN THE MIDDLE AT THIS TIME A VERY LITTLE FARTHER MOTION IN THE PLATE LENS WILL GIVE A DISTINCT IMAGE OF THE OBJECT BUT ENCIRCLED BY A STRONG VIOLET SHADE IF NOW THE TUBE BE LENGTHENED TO ABOUT 25 INCHES AND THE EXPERIMENT REPEATED BY CLOSING THE GLASSES THE VIOLET SPOT IN THE MIDDLE AND THE CIRCULAR RING WHEN THE FOCUS IS OBTAINED WILL HAVE CHANGED TO A FINE BLUE IF AGAIN WE LENGTHEN THE  THE DIFFERENT THICKNESSES OF THE LENSES RENDER THE CORRECTION NECESSARY 27SS8 MR BARLOW ON THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES FOR TUBE CONSIDERABLY THAT IS TO NEARLY 50 INCHES WE SHALL FIND BY REPEATING THE EXPERIMENT THAT IS BY CLOSING STILL MORE THE TWO GLASSES THAT THE CIRCULAR SPOT BEFORE THE IMAGE IS FORMED AND THE SURROUNDING ATMOSPHERE WHEN THE FOCUS IS OBTAINED WILL BE RED ORANGE OR YELLOW AND BETWEEN THESE EXTREMES A FOCAL LENGTH WILL BE FOUND WHERE THE CIRCULAR SPOT IN THE MIDDLE WILL LOSE ALL DISTINGUISHING COLOUR SHOWING ITSELF A BRIGHT WHITE AND WHEN IN THE FOCUS THE IMAGE WILL BE COLOURLESS ALTHOUGH SURROUNDED BY A VISIBLE ATMOSPHERE PRINCIPALLY PROCEEDING FROM A WANT OF SPHERICAL CORRECTION AT THIS TIME THE GLASSES ARE CORRECTED FOR DISPERSION AND THE COMPOUND FOCAL LENGTH MEASURED FROM THE BACK OF THE FLINT AND THE DISTANCE OF THE GLASSES MUST BE ACCURATELY READ OFF AND WITH THESE DATA THE DISPERSION MAY BE OBTAINED BY THE FORMULAE ALREADY GIVEN VIZ D F  2 IN THIS EXPRESSIONF IS THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE PLATE LENS FOR THE GIVEN OBJECT ANDF THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE FLINT FOR PARALLEL RAYS THE FORMER MAY BE FOUND BY DIRECT OBSERVATION WITH THE INDEX INSTRUMENT AS ALREADY DESCRIBED BUT THE LATTER IS BEST DETERMINED BY MEANS OF THE COMPOUND FOCUS THAT IS CALLING THE COMPOUND FOCUS F WE SHALL HAVE 1 1 I AND F BEING THUS DETERMINED IS TO BE EMPLOYED IN THE PRE CEDING FORMULA AS AN EXAMPLE SUPPOSE THE COMPOUND FOCUS MEASURED FROM THE FLINT TO BE 3489 INCHES THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE CROWN LENS 985 INCHES AND THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE LENSES 141 INCHESDETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS C FIRST I I FL 3889 844 WHENCEF 1 ILS INCHES THEN D  F 844 649 FF 9 85SXI3  91 THE DISPERSIVE RATIO SOUGHT ON THE COMPUTATION OF THE RADIIFOR CORRECTING SPHERICAL ABERRATION AND COLOUR 5 WE HAVE SEEN THAT TO RENDER AN OBJECTGLASS ACHROMATIC IT IS ONLY NECESSARY TO HAVE THE FOCAL LENGTHS IN THE DIRECT RATIO OF THE DISPERSIVE POWER OF THE TWO GLASSES LET THIS RATIO BE I  D THEN REPRESENTING THE COMPOUND FOCAL LENGTH BY F WE SHALL HAVE F  F   D  FOCAL LENGTH OF PLATE F  FI D   FOCAL LENGTH OF FLINT AND THESE FOCAL LENGTHS WITHOUT ANY OTHER CONDITION WILL GIVE A COMPOUND FOCAL LENGTH F AND PRODUCE ACHROMATIC CORRECTION LET I 4 A  INDEX OF PLATE 1  A INDEX OF FLINT R R THE RADII OF CURVATURE IN THE PLATE R R THOSE OF THE FLINT THE ORDER OF THE RADII RECKONED FROM THE OBJECT SIDE BEING R R R R THE TWO FORMER BEING CONVEX AND THE LATTER CONCAVE UNLESS THE CONTRARY BE STATED THEN BY A KNOWN FORMULA WE SHALL HAVE I I I R R A 1 I R FI N  R FA 239240 MR BARROW ON THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES FOR HERE THEN ARE FOUR QUANTITIES TO BE DETERMINED AND ONLY TWO EQUATIONS SO THAT IF THE CONDITION OF BEING ACHROMATIC WAS THE ONLY ONE WE MIGHT HAVE ANY VARIETY OF ANSWERS AT PLEASURE BUT IT IS ALSO REQUIRED THAT THE OBJECTGLASS SHALL BE FREE FROM SPHERICAL ABERRATION WHICH IS STILL ONLY A THIRD CONDITION AND THEREFORE EVEN WITH THIS THE QUESTION MAY STILL BE CONSIDERED AS ADMITTING OF VARIOUS SOLUTIONS BUT A FOURTH CONDITION MAY BE THAT THE TWO INTERIOR SURFACES SHALL BE EITHER ACTUALLY EQUAL OR VERY NEARLY SO AND THIS LAST CON DITION SERVES TO BRING THE SOLUTION WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS ALTHOUGH IT IS STILL NOT STRICTLY LIMITED UNLESS WE INSIST UPON PERFECT CONTACT SURFACES OR SOME OTHER SPECIFIC CONDITION MR HERSCHEL IN HIS VERY ELABORATE AND VALUABLE PAPER ON THIS SUBJECT IN THE PHIL TRANS PART II 1821 INSTEAD OF THIS LAST CONDITION HAS TAKEN ANOTHER VIZ  THE DESTRUCTION OF ABERRATION NOT ONLY FOR PARALLEL RAYS BUT ALSO FOR RAYS DIVERG ING FROM A POINT AT ANY FINITE DISTANCE THE RESULTING EQUATIONS BY THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS CONDI TION MAKE THE RADII OF THE TWO INTERIOR SURFACES NEARLY EQUAL BUT IN SEVERAL CASES THE CONVEX SIDE IS THE DEEPER AND THE TWO SURFACES THEREFORE RIDE IN THE MIDDLE UNLESS SEPARATED AT THE EDGES BY PAPER OR SOME OTHER SUBSTANCE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THEM WHICH BY MANY PRACTICAL OPTICIANS IS CONSIDERED OBJECTIONABLE THE CONTACT SURFACES ARE ALSO IN THIS CONSTRUC TION DEEPER AND THE ACTUAL QUANTITY OF ABERRATION IN EITHER LENS TO BE CORRECTED IS GREATER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE NE CESSARY MOREOVER BY INSISTING UPON ANY FOURTH CONDITION  MR HERSCHEL SUGGESTS THAT THE BEST WAY WOULD BE IN ALL CASES TO FRAME EACH LENS INTO A SEPARATE CELL AND TO ADJUST THEM TO EACH OTHER BY SCREWS IN THIS CASE OF COURSE IT WOULD BE INDIFFERENT WHICH OF THE TWO WERE THE DEEPER SURFACEDETERMINING THE DISPERSIVE RATIO OF GLASS C EQUALLY RIGID WITH THE OTHER THREE THE WORKMAN IS RESTRICTED TO A VERY EXACT ACCORDANCE IN THE MEASURE OF ALL HIS FOUR TOOLS AND IT LEAVES HIM NO OPPORTUNITY OF MATCHING A GOOD FLINT LENS WITH A PLATE OR A PLATE WITH A FLINT WHICH IS IN MANY CASES A DESIRABLE CONVENIENCE I HAVE NOT THEREFORE INSISTED RIGIDLY UPON A FOURTH CONDITION BUT HAVE MADE THIS SUBSERVIENT TO THE ABOVE CONVENIENCE BY ONLY REQUIRING THAT THE CONTACT SURFACES SHALL BE EITHER EXACTLY OR NEARLY EQUAL AND THE CONCAVE THE DEEPER WHEN THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM THE OPTICIAN IS THUS ENABLED TO MAKE A CHOICE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS OF THE RADII OF ONE OF HIS LENSES AND HAS ONLY TO MATCH THE OTHER TO IT BY THIS MEANS THE INTRICATE EQUATION ARISING OUT OF THE FOURTH CONDITION IS AVOIDED I AM QUITE AWARE THAT IN THIS WAY A GREAT SACRIFICE IS MADE OF ANA LYTICAL ELEGANCE BUT AS MY OBJECT HAS BEEN TO BRING THE CALCULATION FULLY WITHIN THE REACH OF SUCH PRACTICAL OPTICIANS AS HAVE NO PRETENSIONS TO A KNOWLEDGE OF ANALYSIS I HAVE PREFERED A SIMPLE ALTHOUGH SOMEWHAT INDIRECT METHOD OF COMPUTATION TO ONE MORE DIRECT AND REFINED BUT AT THE SAME TIME MORE INTRICATE AND LABORIOUS THE PRINCIPLE HERE PRO POSED WILL BE ILLUSTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS THE INVESTIGATION OF THE ABERRATION PRODUCED AT ONE SPHERI CAL SURFACE IS FOUND IN MOST OF OUR OPTICAL TREATISES AND NEED NOT THEREFORE BE REPEATED IN THIS PLACE OF THESE EX PRESSIONS THAT WHICH IS GIVEN IN WOODS OPTICS ART 397 IS PERHAPS ONE OF THE MOST SIMPLE I SHALL THEREFORE ADOPT THIS AND REFER THE READER TO THE WORK

THIS MEDIUM WILL BE ADR D A  R Y P ADR A I D X 2R  4 THIS EXPRESSION IS FOR THE CASE OF DIVERGING RAYS ON A CON VEX SURFACE OF A DENSER MEDIUM BUT IT WILL APPLY TO THE CASE OF A CONCAVE SURFACE BY MERELY CHANGING ALL THE SIGNS OF R FOR PARALLEL RAYS D MUST BE CONSIDERED INFINITE AND FOR CON VERGING RAYS D MUST BE TAKEN NEGATIVE SO THAT THIS EXPRES SION IS GENERAL IN ALL CASES WHERE THE RAYS ENTER A DENSER MEDIUM WHEN THE RAYS PASS FROM A DENSE TO A RARE MEDIUM THE RATIO IS I  A  BUT THIS TO BE RENDERED SYMMETRICAL MUST BE REDUCED TO 11 B WHERE B    SUBSTITUTING THERE FORE IN THE ABOVE

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

NEAR THESE LIMITS WILL HAVE BUT A SMALL QUANTITY OF ABERRATION IN THE PLATE LENS TO BE CORRECTED BY THE FLINT LENS BUT WHEN WE EMPLOY SUCH NUMBERS AS REQUIRE A RATIO OF 3 TO I OR 4 TO 1 IN THE PLATE THEN THE ABER RATION TO BE CORRECTED BY THE FLINT IS VERY CONSIDERABLE AND A SMALL DISCREPANCE BETWEEN THE COMPUTED AND PRACTICAL RADII WILL PRODUCE A MUCH GREATER ERROR THAN THE SAME DISCREPANCES

RIGID AGREEMENT HAS PLACE BETWEEN THE COMPUTED RADII AND THE RADII EMPLOYED THE DISCREPANCE HAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE EFFECT UPON THE CORRECTION OF THE OBJECTGLASS THE RULE WHICH I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN IN THE PRE CEDING PAGES IS I BELIEVE EQUALLY CORRECT BUT IT POSSESSES NONE OF THE ELEGANCE OF INVESTIGATION WHICH DISTINGUISHES THE OTHER TO COMPENSATE FOR THIS HOWEVER IT HAS AN EXTENSIVE RANGE OF APPLICATION AND WILL ENABLE US IN ALL CASES TO SELECT THOSE PARTICULAR RADII WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE REQUIRED COR RECTION WITH THE LEAST LIABILITY TO ERROR AND WITH THE CLOSEST CONTACT SURFACES WE MAY ALSO BY REJECTING THE LATTER CON DITION MATCH ANY FLINT WHATSOEVER WITH ITS PROPER PLATE WHICH IS I BELIEVE A GREAT PRACTICAL CONVENIENCE THE ABOVE ARE ONLY A FEW OUT OF A GREAT NUMBER

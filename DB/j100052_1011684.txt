RESOURCES AND THEIR BEARING ON CONSERVATION BY J A HOLMES Chief Technologic Branch U S Geological Survey member of National Conservation Commission Washington D C The study of the problem of conservation with reference to mineral wealth is easily separable into two divisions considering under one the mineral resources as they exist today and under the other a study of the production consumption and waste of these resources and the prevention of this waste The former of these is discussed in another paper in this volume by the Director of the Geological Survey In discussing the latter in the following pages but brief consideration can be given to each phase of the subject The mineral products in the United States for the year 1907 ex ceeded 2ooooooooo in value It is estimated that the waste in the mining and use of these materials is equivalent to more than onefourth of this amount exceeding I500000 per day1 The Larger Contributors to Our Mineral WealthThe follow ing are a dozen of the largest individual contributions to this 2000 oooooo addition to the nations wealth during I907 in the form of crude mineral products the values given being those at the mines or works Coal 480000000 tons with a value of  615000000 Iron ore 52000000 long tons valued at  132000000 Pig iron 26ooo000 long tons valued at  530000000 Copper 869oooooo pounds valued at  I174000000 Clay products valued at  I59000000 Petroleum I66oooooo barrels valued at  120000000 Gold 4375000 ounces valued at  90000000 Stone valued at  7I000000 Cement 52000000 barrels valued at  56000000 Natural gas valued at  53000000 Lead 365000 tons valued at  38700000 Zinc nearly 224000 tons valued at  26400000 Phosphate rock 2265000 tons valued at  Io650000 The statistics of mineral production given in this paper are taken mainly from the reports of The Mineral Resources Division of the U S Geological Survey 686Production and Waste of Mineral Resources The total value of our nonmetallic products during I907 was more than II66ooo000000ooo Of this the fuels coal petroleum and natural gas approximated 788oooooo structural materials clay products stone cement lime slate etc nearly

precious stones talc tungsten feldspar bauxite mica fullers earth etc about 30387ooo The total value of the metallic products iron copper gold lead silver zinc aluminum quicksilver tin and platinum for the same year was 903000000 Of this total mineral production in the United States we exported during I907 mineral products to the value of 347 oooooo This was in part offset by the importation of mineral products to the value of 225000000 The value of mineral products consumed in the United States during I907 was therefore 219I000000 or I22000000 in excess of the production American Contributions to the Worlds Mineral Production The value of mineral production in the United States as compared to that in other countries is indicated by the fact that during i907 the United States produced 63 per cent of the worlds petroleum nearly 55 per cent of its copper 52 per cent of its phosphate rock 46 per cent of its steel 43 per cent of its cement 40 per cent of its iron ore 40 per cent of its coal supply 33 per cent of its lead 30 per cent of its silver more than 27 per cent of its zinc and 22 per cent of its gold Rapid Growth of Our Mineral ProductionThere are few better illustrations of the rapid development of this country than the growth of this mineral production Thus in I88o the value of the mineral products in the United States approximated 365ooo ooo in 1890 6o6oooooo in 1900 II07000000 in 1907 2o69 oooooo The total value of the mineral products for the ten years I886 to I889 inclusive was 4478oooooo that for the ten years I890 to I899 inclusive was approximately 6594000000 whereas that for the eight years from I900 to I907 inclusive was 12025 687 203The Annals of the American Academy oooooo If the mineral production for 1908 and 1909 approaches 2000000000 for each year we shall have for the thirty years be ginning with I88o a total mineral production of approximately 27000000000 The following table indicates by years the rapid increase in

indicated by the figures given above the estimated value of mineral products for the current decade is nearly two and onehalf times that for the preceding decade and the coal production alone for I907 exceeded in value the total mineral production for any year prior to I892 Still more striking are the figures indicating our per capita value of the mineral products which in I88o were 725 in I890 968 in I900 I455 and in 1907 2419 Production Waste and Duration of Fuel ResourcesUnlike the supply of water which goes and comes perennially or of farm crops which annually succeed one another or even of the forests which may come in succession with longer intervening periods the supplies of mineral resources are limited and they can neither be increased nor reproduced Our mineral fuels deserve special con sideration in this connection for the further reason that their use involves their immediate and complete destruction and the in crease in the manufacture and use of other materials also increases the consumption of fuels for heat light and power and for metal lurgical purposes Considerations such as these warrant special at tention being given to the fuel problem in any discussion of con servation 2Estimated 688 204Production and Waste of Mineral Resources From the beginning of our records of coal mining in the United States about I814 to the close of I907 there were mined nearly 7000000000 tons of coal During this time the waste in mining probably exceeded 3500000000 tons The average rate of increase in production from I846 to the close of 1907 was 736 per cent per annum The rate of production however has been a slightly decreasing one Taking this and other factors into con sideration the experts of the Geological Survey have estimated that if this growing rate of consumption continues the easily acces sible and available coal supplies aggregating 1400000000000 tons will be exhausted before the middle of the next century As to whether or how long this increasing rate of production and con sumption will continue there may be reasonable differences of opinion The estimates are based on the experience and development of the nation during the past threequarters of a century including its tendency toward an increasing per capita consumption of fuel3 However the time of this exhaustion will be naturally post poned by virtue of the fact that long before exhaustion would be reached the increasing scarcity and the higher price of fuel would cause a lessening in its rate of consumption Furthermore the adoption of more efficient methods in connection with the mining and use of coal and the larger use of water power and other possi ble substitutes for coal may serve to diminish the present increasing rate of consumption and thereby extend the life of the supplies On the other hand manufacturing in this country will doubtless long continue togrow more rapidly than the population and the tendency will be to increase the demand for coal The waste of coal both in mining operations and in use is far greater than it should be From the beginning of our mining opera tions down to the present time the average loss in the mining of bituminous coal has probably exceeded 50 per cent of the total production During the last few years however both in the anthra cite and highgrade bituminous coals in a number of our Eastern coal fields the loss in mining has beenreduced to smaller percen tages In portions of the central and Western coal regions the per centage of loss still exceeds 50 per cent The losses in the use of coal for different purposes cannot be estimated with accuracy but that these losses are serious is indi 3See also page 210 689 205The Annals of the American Academy cated by the fact that in the power plants of the country less than 10 per cent of the heat value of the coal is converted into actual work and lighting plants convert less than I per cent of the heat value of the coal into electric light Large amounts of gas from our blast furnaces are lost by being turned into the atmosphere To a small but increasing extent however these gases are being trans formed into power through the use of gas engines In connection with the coking industry gases and other byproducts to the value of more than 55000000 were wasted in I907 Of petroleum the total production during the last half century has exceeded i8ooo000ooo barrels The rapidly increasing rate at which this production has been obtained and a careful study of the existing known petroleum supplies indicate the probable ex haustion of these known supplies before the middle of the present century It is probable however that the life of the petroleum industry will be largely extended through the discovery of other supplies as well as through a more efficient use and therefore a lessening in the rate of increase in the demand for existing petro leum products The loss or waste of petroleum is proportionately far less than that ofmost other mineral products It is unfortunate however that so large a proportion of this material which is invaluable for illuminating and lubricating and other specific purposes should be so extensively used as fuel in locomotives steamships and other power plants The consumption of petroleum for fuel purposes during I907 exceeded 35000000 barrels Concerning the production of natural gas existing records are incomplete For the twenty years from I888 to I907 inclusive the value of the natural gas recorded was a little more than 493000000 The waste of this material has been enormous The gas wasted has greatly exceeded that which has been used More care is exercised now than was formerly the case to prevent the waste and provide for the efficient use of natural gas but it is estimated that even at the present time the daily loss of gas is not less than 1000000000 cubic feet or equivalent to I43ooo barrels of petroleum and in one field the Caddo field of Louisiana the daily loss of gas is now not less than 70000000 cubic feet enough to light ten cities the size of Washington and equivalent to a waste of Ioooo barrels of petroleum per day 690 206Production and Waste of Mineral Resources 207 Production and Waste of Metallic ResourcesIn a brief paper a discussion of this character may be limited to iron and steel and a few major metals such as copper gold silver lead and zinc The production of iron ore in the United States has increased with a rapidity as striking as that in the case of coal The produc tion for ten years from I870 to I879 inclusive was more than 40000000 tons For the ten years I880 to I889 inclusive it was nearly I02000000 tons from I890 to I899 inclusive nearly I84 oooooo tons and from I900oo to I9094 inclusive more than 445 oooooo tons This is an average increase by decades of more than Ioo00 per cent Even with the enormous supplies of iron ore known to be available for future use at this increasing rate of consumption these supplies cannot be expected to meet the demands of the nation for an indefinite period Indeed it is probable that the supplies of highgrade iron ores will be exhausted and large inroads made on the supplies of lower grade ores before the end of the present century The fact that iron and steel unlike our fuels are not fully de stroyed in use but accumulate in a measure as one of our national assets will doubtless in the course of a few generations reduce the present increasing per capita rate of production and consumption of these materials Fortunately there is in the present methods of mining and treatment but little waste in the handling and treatment of the iron ores Notably in the Lake Superior districts not only are the high grade ores gathered with care but also the ores of lower grade are segregated in such manner as will permit of their easy recovery at such time as their use may become practicable In some of the other fields the ore waste is greater but not comparable with pre vailing fuel waste and the losses of iron in modern furnace prac tice are insignificant The most serious sources of waste in the supplies of iron and steel are in the losses of the finished metal in use through wear and through rust and other destructive agencies These losses are permanent are increasing and are believed to be largely preventable The production of gold increased rapidly from the middle of the last century but dropped from 60000000ooo in I852 and I854 to 30000000 in I883 and subsequently increased to its maximum of 4Production for 1908 and 1909 being estimated 69IThe Annals of the A4merican Academy more than 940oo000 in I906 The production of gold5 in the United States from I792 to I847 was 24537000 from I848 to I872 I20475oooo and from I873 to 1907 I741784ooo The total production of gold in the United States from I792 to and in cluding I907 was 143725839 ounces valued at 297I07I000 The important production of silver beginning about I86o reached its maximum of 6350000o ounces in I892 since which time the average annual production has been about 55000000 ounces The total recorded production of silver5 in the United States is as follows From I792 to I847 404500 from I848 to I872 I57749900 and from I873 to and including I907 I35I 841600 atotal of 1730708200oo ounces valued at I509996ooo The production of copper has for many years been steadily increasing It reached its maximum in I906 when the output was nearly 918000000 pounds Its production may be expected to increase largely in future years as the uses of copper are increasing both in quantity and variety The total production from I86o to and including I907 was about I2075000000 pounds Its produc tion by decades illustrates the rapid development of the industry as follows For ten years I86I1870 about 2I8504000 pounds For ten years I87II880 about 421I20000 pounds For ten years I88II890 about I639231OOO pounds For ten years I891I900 about 4348713000 pounds For seven years I901I907 about 54480000oo pounds The production of lead and zinc during the past thirty years has increased rapidly reaching a maximum in I907 The produc tion of lead recorded for I825 was 1500 short tons The total pro duction from I830 to I907 inclusive was 682969I short tons The production by decades since I830 illustrates the progress of the industry as follows For ten years from I830 to I839 inclusive 122500 short tons For ten years from I840 to I849 inclusive 247000 short tons For ten years from I850 to I859 inclusive I688oo short tons For ten years from I86o to I869 inclusive 153900 short tons For ten years from 1870 to 1879 inclusive 547780 short tons For ten years from I88o to I889 inclusive 1345711II short tons For ten years from I89o to I899 inclusive 1824657 short tons For the 8 years from I900 to 1907 inclusive 2417843 short tons 5These figures should be credited to R W Raymond for 1792 to 1873 and to the U S Geological Survey for subsequent years 692 208Production and Waste of Mineral Resources The production of zinc spelter in I873 was 7343 short tons By I875 it had reached I5883 short tons For the ten years from I88o to I889 inclusive the spelter production was 380852 short tons from I890 to I899 inclusive it was 901I59I short tons and for the eight years from I900 to I907 inclusive it was 1446035 short tons Thisgives a total production from I88o to I907 inclu sive of 2751654 short tons The waste in the mining and treatment of gold silver lead and zinc has diminished as modern practice has grown in efficiency but in many cases it is still large in some cases amounting to nearly 50 per cent of the total possible product The waste in the treatment of copper is generally less than that for the other of these metals though the loss in the treatment of certain of the ores of copper exceeds 25 per cent this being additional to losses in mining Much of this waste in the mining and treatment of these metals is a tem porary waste the neglected and often buried lowgrade ores as well as the tailings becoming available for treatment by later and more efficient processes Use and Waste of Structural MaterialsThe supplies of many of the materials used in building and engineering construction such as stone sand gravel slate clays cement lime etc are practically inexhaustible and for that reason need not be extensively discussed The use of these materials has been restricted heretofore espe cially in town and rural building because of the greater cheapness of timber construction but owing to improved methods the cost of buildings of concrete and other fireresisting materials has been diminished while that of wood products has advanced Within the last decade the value of cement manufactures increased from 9900000 to 55900000 for the year or nearly sixfold and the value of clay products from 74500000 to 159oooooo or more than dotible In the same period the value of building stone in creased from 28600000 to 7II00000 or nearly threefold A still larger relative increase in the use of these more durable build ing materials may be looked for during the next several decades since the Government is determining the strength durability and fireresistant properties of these materials and is thus gaining and disseminating information which will serve as a basis of cheaper and more permanent structures The waste of minerals used in building and engineering con 693 209The Annals of the American Academy struction comprises I that due to improper and wasteful methods of mining or quarrying and preparing for market 2 that due to the use of excessive quantities of material because of a lack of knowledge concerning strength and durability and 3 that due to destruction by fire The losses from the last cause alone during I907 due to the direct burning of buildings and their contents were 215000000 Other Mineral SubstancesThe scope of the present article does not permit any extended discussion of the production and waste of other lessimportant mineral substances of which as men tioned above under the several classes some 50 or 60 are produced and used in our industries However attention may be called to the fact that of certain of these such as bauxite corundum mica the ores of manganese chromium tin platinum antimony tungsten etc the production in the United States is already inade quate for our industrial needs and the domestic supplies of these materials even though mined and used with the greatest efficiency will probably always need to be supplemented or replaced by substi tutes or by importations from other countries Other materials such as asphalt sulphur magnesite ochre borax talc and arsenic are found in such quantities that even at the present increasing rates of production the supplies of these mate rials may be expected to meet the needs of the nation beyond the limits of the present century There are still other mineral sub stances such as clays fullers earth grindstones and other abrasive substances feldspar salt gypsum etc of which notwithstanding their importance and the increasing rate of their production the domestic supplies may be expected to meet all future demands Will the Increase in Mineral Production ContinueAttention has been called above to the continued increase both in the total mineral production and in the per capita mineral production of the country It is interesting to note in this connection that there has been a correspondingly marked increase in the per capita consump tion of mineral products The consumption of such products has increased far more rapidly than the population Thus in I88O we used of coal 14 tons per capita in I890 23 tons in 1900 32 tons and in I907 47 tons6 Of pig iron we used in I88o 200 pounds per capita in I890 320 pounds in 1900 391 pounds and in I907 686 6Figures for fiscal years taken from Reports of the U S Bureau of Statistics for both coal and iron 694 210Production and Waste of Mineral Resources pounds Of copper in I890 we used 3 pounds per capita in I900 46 pounds and in I907 64 pounds Of cement we used in I890 70 pounds per capita in I900 92 pounds per capita and in I907 228 pounds per capita The population of this country has increased from 5308000 in 800oo to 75569ooo in I900 After a careful study of the details in connection with this increase and the conditions under which this has come about and a careful comparison of these conditions with those in the more densely populated countries of Europe where similar resources and climatic conditions maintain Mr Henry Gan nett of the United States Geological Survey has estimated that the population of this country will be in I9I0 9o0000ooooo in I950 about 150000000 and in the year 2000 approximately 250000000 In a further study of this question it should be borne in mind that during the past century the energies of the American nation were concerned largely with the conquest of the surface and other agricultural pursuits Though the mining industry grew rapidly after the middle of the century for years gold mining was the domi nant feature It was not until within the past quarter century that general mining and the use of mine products in manufacturing in dustries began to be a serious part of our national life and plans Thus for example as late as I88o the value of our coal product for that year was a little more than 95000000 as compared to gold and silver production of about 7I000000 whereas in I907 with a gold and silver production of I28000000 our coal production had reached 6I5000000 If therefore in connection with the rapid realized and pros pective increases in our population and the still more rapid increase in our per capita production and consumption of mineral products we bear in mind the enormous resources of this country in fuels iron and other essential mineral materials the genius of our people for industry and the extent to which climatic and other conditions favor manufacturing developments one cannot fail to realize that this nation is to become more and more a great mining and manufac turing nation that it must and will develop its varied domestic in dustries to supply not only its own growing needs but also the de mands of a large and steadily increasing export trade thus extend ing and enlarging for generations to come the varied industries in which mineral products are used and therefore that the per capita 695 2II212 The Annals of the American Academy production and consumption of our mineral products will continue to increase for generations to come even more rapidly than our population Already the products of the mine make up 65 per cent of the total freight traffic of the country In order that we may be able to supply the raw materials for these increasing industries it will be necessary that we handle wisely our mineral supplies not only preventing all unnecessary waste but also practicing the highest possible efficiency in the use of these materials Extending the Life of Our SuppliesThe most important phase of the conservation problem is that concerned with the possi bility of preventing unnecessary waste and of bringing about the most efficient use of our resources We need to know how we can extend the life of these resources to meet the future as well as the present needs of the country Investigation is undoubtedly the most important agency for the accomplishment of this purpose Much has already been accomplished through this agency The improvements brought about through the engineering profession during the past half a century in the manufacture of steel and other metallurgical operations and through increased efficiency in the de velopment and operation of power plants are already saving to the nation more than oo100000000ooo tons of fuel per annum Through the work of the chemist and metallurgist in the improvement of tech nologic processes used in other metallurgical and manufacturing industries new and more efficient processes have made enormous savings in the resources of the country as well as in the capital re quired Three lines of investigation will prove useful in the continued development of these economies a a great number and variety of individual investigations of specific problems by the engineers and chemists in private practice b investigations of a more general but also somewhat local character by each of the several states in which are located extensive mining and metallurgical industries c investigations by the general government of those problems which on account of their general character may be of service to the min ing metallurgical and manufacturing industries throughout the country A number of such investigations by the federal government are already well under way and are yielding important general results 696Production and Waste of Mineral Resources Investigations by the states are for the most part limited to the exploration and mapping of local mineral resources The private or individual investigations relate for the most part to specific indi vidual problems connected with the development of specific local industries and are intended for individual or private gain alone The common purpose of all these investigations must be to indi cate a how we can prevent waste b how the mineral products may be mined treated and used with greatest efficiency c how more abundant materials may be substituted for the rarer and more costly materials Through careful educational work much also can be accom plished In this work the federal and the state governments are co6perating as are also in an effective manner the engineering and other allied organizations and the educational institutions throughout the country Through wise legislation also much can be accom plished but unless legislation is wisely planned and administered its influence may be more harmful than beneficial as it may act in restraint of industry rather than by being helpful to its develop ment Conservation and LegislationSelfinterest will naturally con tinue to dominate the policies and activities of corporations and these policies and activities relating primarily to the question of temporary gain may not always be in accord with the best interests of the community the state or the nation To the state and the nation alone can therefore be intrusted the ultimate guardianship of their own futures and to this extent at least the conservation of re sources becomes a state and in a broader sense a national duty and right The United States Supreme Court in a recent decision says The state as the guardian of the public welfare possesses the con stitutional right to insist that its natural advantages shall remain unimpaired by its citizens And the federal constitution gives to Congress the right to provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States Any legislation in behalf of the wiser use of our resources should however be planned and drafted with care so as to guar antee for its provisions a remedial and beneficial rather than a harmful influence The lack of uniformity in our state mining laws even in the case of adjoining states where conditions are sim ilar is one of the unfortunate developments of our system The 697 213The Annals of the American Academy differences have been based probably upon the mistaken idea that local mining conditions in different states require different local legislative treatment As a matter of fact under modern commer cial conditions these differences between state laws may seriously hamper the mining industry in one or another of the states It would be helpful to the mining industry in all the states and helpful to the conservation movement if mining legislation in the different states could be made measurably uniform in its provi sions leaving for special separate treatment the few really local problems The benefits which have often resulted from conferences and wise cooperation between individuals or states and even be tween nations would become manifest in legislative as they have in other matters pertaining to the public welfare Both in legislation and in public opinion we must maintain as essential a rational basis for the conservation movement which recognizes I the rights of the individual to property and to reason able profits on his investments or on his labor and 2 the para mount rights respectively of the community of the state and of the nation to safeguard the future as well as the present welfare of its citizens 698 214

Latin and Mathematics if Eng lish be put first of all then the difficulty of finding a proper place for Science and French or German will be reduced to a minimum if it does not altogether disappear and a psychologically sound and practically workable programme wilt have been secured EDITOR COLLEGE REQUIREMENTS IN GREEK The recent movement of the National Council of Education toward the establishment of a standard curriculum for the second ary schools is not unlikely to prove of considerable importance it may prove of the highest importance for our whole system of higher education It is certainly an attempt worth making If it is to be made at all certainly this is the time The settlement which the next few decades make of the relation between the college and the university is likely to be in its chief outlines final The problem about which all questions centre concerns the position of the college in the scheme Are we to reach the German solution with its dualism of gymnasium and university  Is the old college course to be divided out between the secondary school and the university  Or shall we settle upon the threefold division  the secondary course the college course the university course The settlement of the question will depend essentially upon the location of the frontier between the secondary school and the college It is largely a question of the students age At present in the East this frontier is near the average age nine teen As this frontier has advanced into the oldtime territory of the college course the university course has correspondingly in trudeditself at the other side Annihilation by partition threat ens the college The larger institutions equipped for university courses may regard this with unconcern The interests of edu cation in the large will not however tolerate a disregard of the existing fact that there are in this country at least two hundred and fifty institutions equipped and endowed for the maintenance of the college course proper A solution of our problem that is to claim general respect and liberate us from our present con fusion must evidently take full cognizance of the vested interests 7374 The School Review of the colleges The movement toward the establishment of a standard curriculum for the secondary schools is a movement toward common understanding between all the colleges of the country quite as much as between the secondary schools and col leges of any part of the country It is not a movement toward the advance of standard nor even toward the extension of the highest requirements now existing in some colleges to all col leges For the problem we have in hand highest is not necessa rily synonymous with best We may indeed with reason inquire whether the current tendency to identify the highest with best may not be merely a relic of that earlier ideal which saw no hope of an American university except in the elevation and transmu tation of the American college An investigation of the existing requirements in Greek made by the writer in preparation for the Greek conference of December 28 was therefore extended beyond the limits of the colleges of highest standard and made to include 172 wellestablished institutions representing every section of the country and distributed according to sections of the country as follows New England I7 Middle States including Maryland and District of Columbia 38 Southern States 33 cisMissis sippian West 46 transMississippian West 38 and according to states as follows Maine  3 Nortli Carolina  3

Columbia 3 Indiana  6 Washington   Virginia  7 Illinois I2 Oregon 3 West Virginia  I Michigan    5 California  5 The limitation of the inquiry to Greek sets limits upon the value of the results but the test of advancement i e of college standard furnished by the Greek requirements will nevertheless be found particularly satisfactory for a number of reasons I there is a general agreement upon the order and material of the introductory study so that comparison is possible 2 the timeCollege Requirements in Greek assigned is narrow and more generally than in any other study restricted to the correspondingly same period in the education of the student 3 the various levels of requirements class them selves more nearly by complete periods as years thus one year or two years or three In regard to the amount of reading required almost all the col leges set definite assignments But two have been found Har vard and the University of Chicago which name no other test in reading than the exercise at sight The following exact a test in reading easy Attic prose at sight as additional to the test in required reading Adelbert Cornell Univ Leland Stanford Amherst Des Moines Coll Vanderbilt

Canadian colleges stand quite by themselves in at least the externals of requirement The honor examinations which are maintained by most of them represent a very much higher standard than the ordinary or minimum examinations Thus the University of Toronto makes for these examinations the addi tional requirement of one book of the Odyssey and two dialogues of Plato and additional prose composition the Victoria Univer sity one book of the Odyssey two orations of Demosthenes or two dialogues of Plato and additional prose composition Sim ilar are the honor examinations of University College

Canadian requirements represent considerably more than they at first sight appear to when compared with those of the States The amount read is less in proportion to the thorough ness of grammatical drill They possess at least the merit of a tolerable uniformity Both in the honor standards and the ordi nary all the Canadian colleges are so far as the externals of re quirement are concerned essentially upon the same level in enviable contrast to the wilderness of disorder that surrounds us here In the case of the requirements in the States it is undoubt edly extremely difficult to determine how far the apparent dis crepancies of publicly announced standards are real Several colleges included in our list of highest requirement are open to the suspicion of having published the highest figures merely as reclame Some think it is well to hitch ones  wagon to a star We wish too we might be in possession of some mechanism some sort of enkrateiometer to measure and record for us the willpower of colleges in adhering to their published requirements We suspect that in the competition for students the academic con science too often drugs itself with the easy recipe of  conditions It must furthermore be recognized that the number of pages of Greek text which a pupil has ambled through or been dragged through is a most uncertain test of the amount of Greek he knows The test of translation from required work may prove little more than a test of the pupils memory of the sense Re peated drill may have made him so familiar with the words of the English translation that the Greek text plays but little more part in the exercise than to furnish stepping stones for a hop and a skip The test of reading at sight sets a check upon this but we are inclined to doubt whether this test can be depended on when taken by itself The experience of five years in the Cor nell University scholarship examinations shows that the rank of competitors based on sighttranslation does not correspond closely to that based on grammatical work and composition Ready sighttranslation often involves a special form of cleverness that does not adapt itself to the accuracies of grammar and composi tion It seems to us that the four different tests may be wisely combined Either of the three however the sight test the grammar test or the composition test gives a better assurance of quality than the test from prepared translation The surest test 80College Requirements in Greek which can be made from the test required for translation is to use it as the basis of exercises in composition Exercises from com position books are largely a delusion at least as tests The best assurance of uniformity in admission requirements will after all be found in the standards of good work existing in the scholarly sense of the teachers themselves Both colleges and preparatory schools run great risk of isolation of standard through exclusive use of their own graduates as teachersthe breeding in and in principle The greatest benefit may be expected from any organization of schools that will favor a com mon understanding between large numbers of institutions Thus the plan of the University of Chicago with its affiliated schools and colleges is a most hopeful and timely movement in higher education The recent calendar of Des Moines College Ia 189293 brings ample evidence of the stimulating influence of this association In reviewing the whole mass of the Greek requirements which we have classified and still more in going behind the externals of these requirements and examining the courses of study laid down in the preparatory schools upon which the respective col leges largely base their courses we find that in reality there are three main groups of requirements to one of which almost all the different ones can be readily referred These groups are de termined by time rather than quantity They consist of those which require a preparation of three years of two years of one year respectively or to state it in terms of number of recitations of 540600 recitations of 360380 of I80200 To the first group belong of the 153 colleges requiring Greek which have been examined about I8 per cent to the second about 49 per cent to the third about 33 per cent The last figure would have been considerably increased and the two first decreased if a larger number of colleges had been examined In regard to the requirement of Homer it is to be noticed that there is no college in the Southern states proper which makes any requirement  also that 53 per cent of those requiring Greek omit Homer It is certainly a fortunate thing that the colleges of the third group 33 per cent omit Homer but it will we believe be regarded by most competent authorities a great misfortune that those of the second group 49 per cent make any attempt to in trude the study upon their slender allowance of 360 recitations 8IThe School Review for Greek and yet it is almost certain that a majority of them do this After 240 recitations have been given to instruction in the grammar reading and writing of Attic prose and before any ex cept the most brilliant scholars can have secured any firm grasp of the forms and principles of the language a class is carried over into another idiom almost another language as distinct from Attic prose as the language of Chaucer from that of Irving and introduced to a  mixing up of things which leaves noth ing as certain and favors the conviction that the Greek is a lan guage in which all things are possible If Homer is to be read in the preparatory course it must cer tainly be a threeyears course and even then the Attic prose Greek must be jealously kept as the basis of all grammatical study and the practice of writing Attic prose continued during the study of Homer In the short time available for the prepara tory work in Greek we cannot expect two languages to be ac quired To the prevailing usage of treating Greek as a twolan guage study must be attributed much of that uncertainty about essentials which characterizes the knowledgefund of the average Freshman especially when coming from the twoyear prepara tory course The diversity in the pronunciation of Greek is also a great barrier to successful use of the time allotted to the study Happy the student who goes through his entire course in Greek with only one pronunciation But in passing from school to college from school to school from teacher to teacher he is now almost certain to encounter at least two We must reach some agree ment There are but two selfconsistent systems upon which we can unite Either we must pronounce as the best evidence shows that the Athenians of the fifth and fourth centuries B C pro nounced or we must accept the standards of modern Greek The latter has the practical advantage of introduction to an important and increasingly important living language but the great disad vantage of almost entirely obscuring the vowelsystem The former involves some changes in the system still in use in most of our West ern and of our Eastern colleges  thus e epsiloniota must be pro nounced as ei in neigh v eta as open Italic e o omicron as close Italic o w omega as open Italic o ev epsilonupsilon with the separate sounds in close succession v upsilon as French u In any case we must recognize that in this as in most of the matters 82The High School and its Enemies discussed agreement and a common understanding are more im portant than any one mans scheme May the gods give us the mind and show us the way  to be in the unity Benj Ide Wheeler Cornell University THE HIGH SCHOOL AND ITS ENEMIES One of the effects of a good education is that people are taught to be tolerant of diversities of opinion There is no surer sign of true culture in man or woman than the desire and the ability to understand and to appreciate the discordant opinions that pre vail among men on all the subjects of deepest interest to man kind People are born with different endowments into different envi ronments are subject to widely different kinds oftraining grow up amid different circumstances and pass their lives in intimate associations that have little in commonis it strange that they do not all think alike  Would it not be a miracle if they did Men differ in religion in politics in their estimates of all the af fairs of life as naturally as they differ in stature form and com plexion And when one is ready to admit that another may radically differ with him in opinion on vital questions without being either a scoundrel or an idiot or even a crank he is not far from that kingdom where men strive after truth and right eousness withott hypocrisy and without partiality seeking neither emolument nor applause but only the priceless possession of a mind unwarped by prejudice a soul unstained by sin and a heart with sympathies as wide and deep as human weal and woe Now there is no subject that interests more people than edu cation and on none except religion have men differed more widely Whether you regard the extent to which all men should be made participants as far as possible in a common culture or the things considered to be of chief importance in that culture or the wisest most salutary and most successful method of accom plishing itof drawing out the latent capacities of the mind and making them capable of vigorous and useful employment in the various walks of lifeyou find among men who have devoted 83

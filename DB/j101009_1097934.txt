I have read with great interest the able and interesting articles of Mr H C McDowell Jr in the March number and of Mr Raleigh C Minor in the April number of the REGISTER on Adversary Pos session and I desire to contribute the following to the discussion As stated in Stull v Rich Patch Co 92 Va 2812 the open ques tion in Virginia on adversary possession is this Does the adverse possession of a claimant under a junior title extend to his whole tract or only to the extent of his enclosures where there are conflicting grants or deeds of land causing an interlock the claimant under the elder title being in actual possession of a part of his land outside of the interlock when the claimant under the junior title entered upon and took actual possession of a part of the interlock claiming title to the whole extent of his boundary  We will for the present assume it to be settled that at common law the answer to this question would be The adverse possession of the claimant under the junior title extends only to the extent of his enclosures But Mr Minor suggests  It seems by no means certain that the Virginia statute does not reverse the rule He then proceeds to demonstrate that the statute should be construed as if it read In controversies afifcting real estate possession of part of the land in dispute shall not be construed as possession of the whole of such land where actual ad verse possession thereof can be proved  and that the corollary to be drawn therefrom should read Possession of part of the land in dispute shall be construed as possession of the whole of such land where no actual adverse possession is proved If it is meant by this that the senior title holder must have a pedis positio of the land in dispute before he can be considered in possessionVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER thereof it is believed that this construction of the statute is erroneous as will hereinafter more particularly appear But aside from this Mr Minor makes the following deduction Applying the corollary in this form it is at once seen that the juniors posses sion of part of the interlock must be construed as possession of the whole where no actual adverse possession thereof is proved It is submitted that this conclusion does not follow It cannot fol low unless the words of the statute possession of a part can be read as applying to the junior as well as to the senior claimant Merely to confine the application of the statute to the land in dispute is not sufficient to warrant the above deduction Mr McDowell in the extract from his article quoted by Mr Minor pp 8434 Va Law Register takes the position that the words possession of a part apply only to the possession of the senior title holder I do not understand that Mr Minor assails this position but as the determination of whether it be well or ill taken is most important in arriving at a correct conclusion of the matter in hand it may be worth while to consider it briefly but as critically and carefully as we can In the first place it is supposed to be a matter beyond question that the words  possession of a part in the statute sec 2740 Code Va 1887 do apply to the possession of the senior title holder or rightful owner The only matter which seems to be open for discussion is whether these words may not also apply to the junior title holder or disseisor of the rightful owner If we ascertain the meaning of the words  adverse possession used in the closing part of the statute we shall have therein sufficient data to determine with certainty whether the junior title holder may also be referred to in the preceding part of the statute The words adverse possession have a well settled and definite meaning in the law In the light of this meaning the statute must be read By an adverse possession is to be understood one dependent upon an adverse and conflicting title grounded upon an ouster or dispossession of the rightful owner which in case of a freehold is known as a disseisin Littleton defines a disseisin 3 Th Co Lit 5 to be where a man entereth into any lands or tene ments when his entry is not con geable lawful and oitsteth him that hth the freehold 2 Minors Inst 3d ed 573 Littleton in sec 279 says Every entry is no disseisin unless there be an ouster of the freehold 2 MayADVERSARY POSSESSION Co Lit 153 b also says Disseisin is putting a man out of the seisin and ever implies a wrong Hence only the possession of a wrongdoera disseisor of the right ful ownercan be regarded as an  adverse possession The possession of the senior title holder or rightful owner can never be regarded as adverse possession Therefore the words adverse possession in the statute can and do at all times refer only to the possession of the junior title holder or disseisor Hence it follows as an inevitable conclusion that the words pos session of a part in the statute can and do at all times refer only to the possession of the senior title holder or rightful owner This must be so for it would be a reductio ad absurdurn to say that the statute in any case could be construed as if it read In controversies affecting real estate possession of part of the land in dispute by the junior  title holder or disseisor shall not be construed as possession of the whole of such land where an actual adverse possession thereof by the junior title holder or disseisor can be proved Leaving out of consideration for the present then the question of whether the statute should be construed as if the words suggested by Mr Minor land in dispute were inserted we reach this conclu sion namely the statute should be construed as if it read  In controversies affecting real estate possession of part    by the senior title holder or rightful owner shall not be construed as possession of the whole of such land where an actual adverse possession thereof by the junior title holder or disseisor can be proved Such is the conclusion reached from a mere analysis of the language of the statute Let us see what conclusion may be reached from a consideration of the law as it was aforetime  and the necessity of the statute which may be taken to have been the reason for its enactment But before going into the consideration of these matters it may be well to define the meaning with which certain words will be used Seisin signifies in its common law meaning the same thing as possession when applied to a freehold 3 Tho Co Lit 274 There are two kinds of seisin or possession of a freehold known to the common law and two only Seisin or possession in law which is a mere right to the possession seisin or possession in fact or deed which is an actual seisin or actual possession 1 Tho Co Lit 558 574 2 Id 334 and n C 335 to 338 1898 3VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER What is characterized in modern times as  constructive possession  was in no way distinguished by the common law from seisin in fact or in deed or actual seisin or actual possession With these definitions we will now proceed with the consideration of the matter in hand At common law if a man by one title owned lands of whatever quantity or in howsoever many parcels separated and had pedis positio of any part or of any part of any parcbl thereof he was seised in facthad actual seisin actual possessionof the whole of such land and every parcel thereof within the county of his pedis positio If a man will mpake feoffment by deed or without deed of lands or tene ments which he hath in divers towns in one county the livery of seisin made in one parcel of the tenements in one town in the name of all the rest is sufficient for all the lands and tenements comprehended within the same feoffment in all the other towns in the same county 2 Tho Co Lit 337 quoting Littleton sec 61 50 a The holder of such a title had actual possession of the whole of the land or none If he had pedis positio upon only a small part he was yet in actual possession of the whole Again  If a man have cause of entry into any lands or tenements in divers towns in one same county if he enter into one parcel of the lands or tenements which are in one town in the name of all the lands or tenements into which he hath right to enter within all the towns of the same county by such entry he shall have as good a possession and seisin of all the lands or tenements whereof he hath title of entry as if he hath entered in deed into every parcel 2 Tho Co Lit 16 quoting Littleton sec 417 252 a Such was the actual seisin or possession given by the common law to the senior title holder or rightful owner And this actual possession extended to the whole of the land when the latter had pedis positio of only a part thereof although a wrongful claimant might afterwards enter upon some other part of such land and acquire pedis positio of such part Unless the senior title holder was dispossessed of every part of the land covered by his title his seisin in deed or in fact or actual possession was not disturbed even by the pedis positio of the wrongful claimant If A of B be seised of a mese and F of G that no right hath to enter into the same mese claiming the said mese to hold to him and his heirs entereth into the said mese but the same A of B is then continually abiding in the same mese in this case the possession of the freehold shall always be adjudged in A of B and not in F of G because in such case when two be in one house or other tene ments and one claimeth by one title and the other by another title the law shall 4 May1ADVERSARY POSSESSION adjudge him in possession that hath right to have possession of the same tene ments 2 Tho Co Lit 299 quoting Littleton sec 701 368 a In other words the common law gave to the senior title holder who had pedis positio upon his land however limited in extent exclusive actual possession of the whole and so considered such possession for all purposes whatsoever In modern times the latter is denominated constructive possession but the common law gave to it the same effect in all respects as to the pedis positio That is to say this con structive possession of the senior title holder was the same possession that he would have had if he had had pedis positio of the whole land 3 Tho Co Lit 5 and n 4 Kents Com 482 2 Bl Com 312 3 Id 170 174 175 4 Cruises Dig ch IV sec 9 Littleton sec 417 252 a 1 Rob old Pr 449 Green v Liter 8 Cranch 250 Disseisin was an ouster and dispossession of the senior title holder from all actual seisin i e from every part of the land cov ered by his title and an usurpation of the feudal tenure If the senior title holder was left with any pedis positio on any part of the land he was not disseised even as to any other part of the land on which the junior title holder might himself have acquired a pedis positio 4 Kents Corn 482 3 Tho Co Lit 5 and n E see also the celebrated opinion of Lord Mansfield in Taylor v Horde 2 Smiths Lead Cas 4th Am ed Hare  Wallace 414 to 464 A further common law reason for this rule seems patent Mere dispossession was not sufficient to work a disseisin There could be no divided investiture of the feudal tenure and anciently the consent of the lord was necessary to the admission of a tenant into the feud This was never given to the junior title holder so long as the senior title holder had pedis positio of any part of the land covered by his title 3 Tho Co Lit 5 6 and n E 3 Bl Com 171 It may be also noted that in the correct and accurate use of the term disseisin it could never occur in any case unless the senior title holder had seisin in fact of his land at the time of the disseisin Disseisin always imported and required a seisin in fact by the senior title holder which was necessarily also a prior seisin A dis seisin is a wrongful putting out of him that is actually seised of a free hold 3 Tho Co Lit 2 If the senior title holder had a mere legal seisinthe land being vacanthe could not be disseised A junior title holder who should enter upon such land was anciently and accurately no dis seisor The ouster accomplished by such an entry was at common 1898 5VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER law an abatement or intrusion 3 Tho Co Lit 1 2 3 Bl Cor 168 But in time this distinction between  disseisin and  abatement or  intrusion  was lost sight ofas was indeed to be expected in asmuch as the distinction was not important so long as the likeness of each in their beginning was remembered In both the acquisition of title consisted in the wrongful holding of the possession for the pre scriptive period and not in the different manner of the beginning of such possession It is important therefore to remember that the beginning of  disseisin   abatement  and intrusion  was alike in this None of them could begin at common law so long as the senior title holder had pedis positio of any part of his land In the first the rightful owner had to be put out of his actual seisin so that he no longer had any pedis positio upon his land in the other two the land had to be found vacantwith no pedis positio of the right ful owner thereonbefore the wrongful holding could begin Aside from this difference in the beginning of a disseisin from those of an abatement or intrusion they differ not at all iilr the character of holding of possession thereafter necessary to ripen title In this they are all alike and they are also in this precisely alike the case where the beginning of the wrongful seisin is by deforcement In the latter case the tenant is in in the beginning lawfully but the reten tion of the possession is unlawful  Deforcement in its most extensive sense is nomen generalissimum it then signifying the holding of any lands or tenements to which another person has the right So that it includes as well an abate ment an intrusion or disseisin    as any other species of wrong whatsoever whereby he that hath right to the freehold is kept out of the possession 3 Black Cor 172 The holding under a deforcement must have been of such an exclu sive character and extent that  either the entry of the rightful owner is taken away or the deforceor holdeth it so fast as the right owner is driven to his real praecipe wherein it is said unde A eum injuste deforceat or the deforceor so disturbeth the right owner as he cannot enjoy his own 3 Tho Co Lit 3 citing Bract lib 4 fol 238 and Fleta lib 5 cap ii The same character and extent of actual adverse holding is there fore necessary to acquire title by adverse possession begun by dis seisin of the true owner It is therefore manifest that at common law the senior title holder 6 fMayADVERSARY POSSESSION who had pedis positio on any part of the land covered by his title had actual possession of the whole just as if he had the whole en closed any subsequent pedis positio by another notwithstanding Hence it is immaterial where this pedis positio of the senior title holder is so it be on the land covered by his title in question Wher ever it is on such land he was at common law in actual possession of all of his land although some other part of it might be in dispute The mere fact that some one disputed the title to part of his land did not change the character of his possession of the whole We have seen that even a hostile pedis positio with claim of title could not do this a fortiori a mere claim of title or dispute could not Thus and so firmly established was the rule at common law that possession by the senior or rightful owner of any part of the land covered by his title in question was construed to be possession of the whole of such landthat in dispute as well as that not in dispute We may readily apprehend that such a rule was adverse to the true policy of a new and unsettled country In such a country every couragement should be given to actual settlers and its true policy would be opposed to any constructive possession which discouraged actual clearing cultivation and settlement The reason therefore for the enactment of our statute 1 Rev Code 1819 p 510 sec 89 Code Va 1887 sec 2740 is evident The statute was enacted to restrict the operation of the constructive possession given by the common law to the senior title holder It was not meant as we have seen to give any constructive possession to any one The policy of our State in its then condition was opposed to constructive possession in one as much as in another The statute therefore restricted the operation of said constructive possession of the senior title holder in so far as it might have otherwise overridden the pedis positio of the actual settler but no further It is therefore submitted for the consideration of the profession that our statute should be construed as if it read  In controversies affecting real estate possession of part of the land covered by his title in question by the senior title holder or rightful owner shall not be con strued as possession of the whole of such land when actual adverse possession of another part thereof by a junior title holder or disseisor of the rightful owner can be proved And the corollary to be drawn from it Possession of part of the land covered by his title in question by the  senio title holder or rightful owner shall be construed as possession of the whole of such and when no actual adverse possession of any other part thereof by a junior title holder or disseisor of the rightful owner is proved 1898 7VIRGTNIA LAW REGISTER That is to say the true owners constructive possession stands as at common law when there is no actual adverse possession in the case This we know to be true Mr Minors corollary would require the true owner to have a pedis positio on the land in dispute before he could be construed as having possession thereof although there be no actual adverse possession of any part of the land in dispute This we know cannot be law Koiner v Rankin 11 Grat 426 to 428 It would seem therefore both from a consideration of the Virginia statute and of the common law that the answer to the open ques tion in Virginia will be The junior title holder is confined to his pedis positio At another time the writer may still further trespass upon the in dulgence of the profession and of the editor of THE REGISTER with a consideration of the common law origin of constructive posses sion of the reason for its never being given to a  disseisor  and of the decisions in Virginia and elsewhere giving constructive possession in certain cases all of which so far from being founded upon prin ciples antagonistic to the solution ventured above of the  open ques tion in Virginia are it is believed when rightly considered con clusive in its support F W SIMS Louisa Va ADVERSARY POSSESSION A REJOINDER The reply of Mr Raleigh C Minor 3 Va Law Reg 843 to the article in the March number Ibid 763 is interesting and extremely ingenious In attempting a rejoinder the writer will suggest but not elaborate some possible objections to the construction of the statute on adversary possession proposed by Mr Minor This statute Code sec 2740 Mr Minor would read paraphrased as follows Possession of part of the interlock shall be construed as possession of all thereof when no actual adverse possession of any part of the interlock can be proved  And he would apply the words  possession of part to either the senior or the junior grantee The statute thus construed is capable of two readings

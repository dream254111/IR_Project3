J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1097934,ADVERSARY POSSESSION OR THE OPEN QUESTION IN VIRGINIA,I245847,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL IV MAY 1898 NO 1 ADVERSARY POSSESSION OR THE OPEN QUESTION IN VIRGINIA I HAVE READ WITH GREAT INTEREST THE ABLE AND INTERESTING ARTICLES OF MR H C MCDOWELL JR IN THE MARCH NUMBER AND OF MR RALEIGH C MINOR IN THE APRIL NUMBER OF THE REGISTER ON ADVERSARY POS SESSION AND I DESIRE TO CONTRIBUTE THE FOLLOWING TO THE DISCUSSION AS STATED IN STULL V RICH PATCH CO 92 VA 2812 THE OPEN QUES TION IN VIRGINIA ON ADVERSARY POSSESSION IS THIS DOES THE ADVERSE POSSESSION OF A CLAIMANT UNDER A JUNIOR TITLE EXTEND TO HIS WHOLE TRACT OR ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF HIS ENCLOSURES WHERE THERE ARE CONFLICTING GRANTS OR DEEDS OF LAND CAUSING AN INTERLOCK THE CLAIMANT UNDER THE ELDER TITLE BEING IN ACTUAL POSSESSION OF A PART OF HIS LAND OUTSIDE OF THE INTERLOCK WHEN THE CLAIMANT UNDER THE JUNIOR TITLE ENTERED UPON AND TOOK ACTUAL POSSESSION OF A PART OF THE INTERLOCK CLAIMING TITLE TO THE WHOLE EXTENT OF HIS BOUNDARY  WE WILL FOR THE PRESENT ASSUME IT TO BE SETTLED THAT AT COMMON LAW THE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION WOULD BE THE ADVERSE POSSESSION OF THE CLAIMANT UNDER THE JUNIOR TITLE EXTENDS ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF HIS ENCLOSURES BUT MR MINOR SUGGESTS  IT SEEMS BY NO MEANS CERTAIN THAT THE VIRGINIA STATUTE DOES NOT REVERSE THE RULE HE THEN PROCEEDS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE STATUTE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT READ IN CONTROVERSIES AFIFCTING REAL ESTATE POSSESSION OF PART OF THE LAND IN DISPUTE SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF SUCH LAND WHERE ACTUAL AD VERSE POSSESSION THEREOF CAN BE PROVED  AND THAT THE COROLLARY TO BE DRAWN THEREFROM SHOULD READ POSSESSION OF PART OF THE LAND IN DISPUTE SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF SUCH LAND WHERE NO ACTUAL ADVERSE POSSESSION IS PROVED IF IT IS MEANT BY THIS THAT THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER MUST HAVE A PEDIS POSITIO OF THE LAND IN DISPUTE BEFORE HE CAN BE CONSIDERED IN POSSESSIONVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER THEREOF IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS CONSTRUCTION OF THE STATUTE IS ERRONEOUS AS WILL HEREINAFTER MORE PARTICULARLY APPEAR BUT ASIDE FROM THIS MR MINOR MAKES THE FOLLOWING DEDUCTION APPLYING THE COROLLARY IN THIS FORM IT IS AT ONCE SEEN THAT THE JUNIORS POSSES SION OF PART OF THE INTERLOCK MUST BE CONSTRUED AS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE WHERE NO ACTUAL ADVERSE POSSESSION THEREOF IS PROVED IT IS SUBMITTED THAT THIS CONCLUSION DOES NOT FOLLOW IT CANNOT FOL LOW UNLESS THE WORDS OF THE STATUTE POSSESSION OF A PART CAN BE READ AS APPLYING TO THE JUNIOR AS WELL AS TO THE SENIOR CLAIMANT MERELY TO CONFINE THE APPLICATION OF THE STATUTE TO THE LAND IN DISPUTE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO WARRANT THE ABOVE DEDUCTION MR MCDOWELL IN THE EXTRACT FROM HIS ARTICLE QUOTED BY MR MINOR PP 8434 VA LAW REGISTER TAKES THE POSITION THAT THE WORDS POSSESSION OF A PART APPLY ONLY TO THE POSSESSION OF THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER I DO NOT UNDERSTAND THAT MR MINOR ASSAILS THIS POSITION BUT AS THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER IT BE WELL OR ILL TAKEN IS MOST IMPORTANT IN ARRIVING AT A CORRECT CONCLUSION OF THE MATTER IN HAND IT MAY BE WORTH WHILE TO CONSIDER IT BRIEFLY BUT AS CRITICALLY AND CAREFULLY AS WE CAN IN THE FIRST PLACE IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A MATTER BEYOND QUESTION THAT THE WORDS  POSSESSION OF A PART IN THE STATUTE SEC 2740 CODE VA 1887 DO APPLY TO THE POSSESSION OF THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER OR RIGHTFUL OWNER THE ONLY MATTER WHICH SEEMS TO BE OPEN FOR DISCUSSION IS WHETHER THESE WORDS MAY NOT ALSO APPLY TO THE JUNIOR TITLE HOLDER OR DISSEISOR OF THE RIGHTFUL OWNER IF WE ASCERTAIN THE MEANING OF THE WORDS  ADVERSE POSSESSION USED IN THE CLOSING PART OF THE STATUTE WE SHALL HAVE THEREIN SUFFICIENT DATA TO DETERMINE WITH CERTAINTY WHETHER THE JUNIOR TITLE HOLDER MAY ALSO BE REFERRED TO IN THE PRECEDING PART OF THE STATUTE THE WORDS ADVERSE POSSESSION HAVE A WELL SETTLED AND DEFINITE MEANING IN THE LAW IN THE LIGHT OF THIS MEANING THE STATUTE MUST BE READ BY AN ADVERSE POSSESSION IS TO BE UNDERSTOOD ONE DEPENDENT UPON AN ADVERSE AND CONFLICTING TITLE GROUNDED UPON AN OUSTER OR DISPOSSESSION OF THE RIGHTFUL OWNER WHICH IN CASE OF A FREEHOLD IS KNOWN AS A DISSEISIN LITTLETON DEFINES A DISSEISIN 3 TH CO LIT 5 TO BE WHERE A MAN ENTERETH INTO ANY LANDS OR TENE MENTS WHEN HIS ENTRY IS NOT CON GEABLE LAWFUL AND OITSTETH HIM THAT HTH THE FREEHOLD 2 MINORS INST 3D ED 573 LITTLETON IN SEC 279 SAYS EVERY ENTRY IS NO DISSEISIN UNLESS THERE BE AN OUSTER OF THE FREEHOLD 2 MAYADVERSARY POSSESSION CO LIT 153 B ALSO SAYS DISSEISIN IS PUTTING A MAN OUT OF THE SEISIN AND EVER IMPLIES A WRONG HENCE ONLY THE POSSESSION OF A WRONGDOERA DISSEISOR OF THE RIGHT FUL OWNERCAN BE REGARDED AS AN  ADVERSE POSSESSION THE POSSESSION OF THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER OR RIGHTFUL OWNER CAN NEVER BE REGARDED AS ADVERSE POSSESSION THEREFORE THE WORDS ADVERSE POSSESSION IN THE STATUTE CAN AND DO AT ALL TIMES REFER ONLY TO THE POSSESSION OF THE JUNIOR TITLE HOLDER OR DISSEISOR HENCE IT FOLLOWS AS AN INEVITABLE CONCLUSION THAT THE WORDS POS SESSION OF A PART IN THE STATUTE CAN AND DO AT ALL TIMES REFER ONLY TO THE POSSESSION OF THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER OR RIGHTFUL OWNER THIS MUST BE SO FOR IT WOULD BE A REDUCTIO AD ABSURDURN TO SAY THAT THE STATUTE IN ANY CASE COULD BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT READ IN CONTROVERSIES AFFECTING REAL ESTATE POSSESSION OF PART OF THE LAND IN DISPUTE BY THE JUNIOR  TITLE HOLDER OR DISSEISOR SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF SUCH LAND WHERE AN ACTUAL ADVERSE POSSESSION THEREOF BY THE JUNIOR TITLE HOLDER OR DISSEISOR CAN BE PROVED LEAVING OUT OF CONSIDERATION FOR THE PRESENT THEN THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THE STATUTE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS IF THE WORDS SUGGESTED BY MR MINOR LAND IN DISPUTE WERE INSERTED WE REACH THIS CONCLU SION NAMELY THE STATUTE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT READ  IN CONTROVERSIES AFFECTING REAL ESTATE POSSESSION OF PART    BY THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER OR RIGHTFUL OWNER SHALL NOT BE CONSTRUED AS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF SUCH LAND WHERE AN ACTUAL ADVERSE POSSESSION THEREOF BY THE JUNIOR TITLE HOLDER OR DISSEISOR CAN BE PROVED SUCH IS THE CONCLUSION REACHED FROM A MERE ANALYSIS OF THE LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE LET US SEE WHAT CONCLUSION MAY BE REACHED FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE LAW AS IT WAS AFORETIME  AND THE NECESSITY OF THE STATUTE WHICH MAY BE TAKEN TO HAVE BEEN THE REASON FOR ITS ENACTMENT BUT BEFORE GOING INTO THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE MATTERS IT MAY BE WELL TO DEFINE THE MEANING WITH WHICH CERTAIN WORDS WILL BE USED SEISIN SIGNIFIES IN ITS COMMON LAW MEANING THE SAME THING AS POSSESSION WHEN APPLIED TO A FREEHOLD 3 THO CO LIT 274 THERE ARE TWO KINDS OF SEISIN OR POSSESSION OF A FREEHOLD KNOWN TO THE COMMON LAW AND TWO ONLY SEISIN OR POSSESSION IN LAW WHICH IS A

CHARACTERIZED IN MODERN TIMES AS  CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION  WAS IN NO WAY DISTINGUISHED BY THE COMMON LAW FROM SEISIN IN FACT OR IN DEED OR ACTUAL SEISIN OR ACTUAL POSSESSION WITH THESE DEFINITIONS WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH THE CONSIDERATION OF THE MATTER IN HAND AT COMMON LAW IF A MAN BY ONE TITLE OWNED LANDS OF WHATEVER QUANTITY OR IN HOWSOEVER MANY PARCELS SEPARATED AND HAD PEDIS POSITIO OF ANY

PEDIS POSITIO OF SUCH PART UNLESS THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER WAS DISPOSSESSED OF EVERY PART OF THE LAND COVERED BY HIS TITLE HIS SEISIN IN DEED OR IN FACT OR ACTUAL POSSESSION WAS NOT DISTURBED EVEN BY

BEGINNING WAS REMEMBERED IN BOTH THE ACQUISITION OF TITLE CONSISTED IN THE WRONGFUL HOLDING OF THE POSSESSION FOR THE PRE SCRIPTIVE PERIOD AND NOT IN THE DIFFERENT MANNER OF THE BEGINNING OF SUCH POSSESSION IT IS IMPORTANT THEREFORE TO REMEMBER THAT THE BEGINNING OF  DISSEISIN   ABATEMENT  AND INTRUSION  WAS ALIKE IN THIS NONE OF THEM COULD BEGIN AT COMMON LAW SO LONG AS THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER HAD PEDIS POSITIO OF ANY PART OF HIS LAND IN THE FIRST THE RIGHTFUL OWNER HAD TO BE PUT OUT OF HIS ACTUAL SEISIN SO THAT HE NO LONGER HAD ANY PEDIS POSITIO UPON HIS LAND IN THE OTHER TWO THE LAND HAD TO BE FOUND VACANTWITH NO PEDIS POSITIO OF THE RIGHT FUL OWNER THEREONBEFORE THE WRONGFUL HOLDING COULD BEGIN ASIDE FROM THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE BEGINNING OF A DISSEISIN FROM THOSE OF AN ABATEMENT OR INTRUSION THEY DIFFER NOT AT ALL IILR THE CHARACTER OF HOLDING OF POSSESSION THEREAFTER NECESSARY TO RIPEN TITLE IN THIS THEY ARE ALL ALIKE AND THEY ARE ALSO IN THIS PRECISELY ALIKE THE CASE WHERE THE BEGINNING OF THE WRONGFUL SEISIN IS BY DEFORCEMENT IN THE LATTER CASE THE TENANT IS IN IN THE BEGINNING LAWFULLY BUT THE RETEN TION OF THE POSSESSION IS UNLAWFUL  DEFORCEMENT IN ITS MOST EXTENSIVE SENSE IS NOMEN GENERALISSIMUM IT THEN SIGNIFYING THE HOLDING OF ANY LANDS OR TENEMENTS TO WHICH ANOTHER PERSON HAS THE RIGHT SO THAT IT INCLUDES AS WELL AN ABATE MENT AN INTRUSION OR

COMMON LAW IN ACTUAL POSSESSION OF ALL OF HIS LAND ALTHOUGH SOME OTHER PART OF IT MIGHT BE IN DISPUTE THE MERE FACT THAT SOME ONE DISPUTED THE TITLE TO PART OF HIS LAND DID NOT CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF HIS POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE WE HAVE SEEN THAT EVEN A HOSTILE PEDIS POSITIO WITH CLAIM OF TITLE COULD NOT DO THIS A FORTIORI A MERE CLAIM OF TITLE OR DISPUTE COULD NOT THUS AND SO FIRMLY ESTABLISHED WAS THE RULE AT COMMON LAW THAT POSSESSION BY THE SENIOR OR RIGHTFUL OWNER OF ANY PART OF THE LAND COVERED BY HIS TITLE IN QUESTION WAS CONSTRUED TO BE POSSESSION OF THE WHOLE OF SUCH LANDTHAT IN DISPUTE AS WELL AS THAT NOT IN DISPUTE WE MAY READILY APPREHEND THAT SUCH A RULE WAS ADVERSE TO THE TRUE POLICY OF A NEW AND UNSETTLED COUNTRY IN SUCH A COUNTRY EVERY COURAGEMENT SHOULD BE GIVEN TO ACTUAL SETTLERS AND ITS TRUE POLICY WOULD BE OPPOSED TO ANY CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION WHICH DISCOURAGED ACTUAL CLEARING CULTIVATION AND SETTLEMENT THE REASON THEREFORE FOR THE ENACTMENT OF OUR STATUTE 1

THEREFORE RESTRICTED THE OPERATION OF SAID CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION OF THE SENIOR TITLE HOLDER IN SO FAR AS IT MIGHT HAVE OTHERWISE OVERRIDDEN THE PEDIS POSITIO OF THE ACTUAL SETTLER BUT NO FURTHER IT IS THEREFORE SUBMITTED FOR THE CONSIDERATION OF THE PROFESSION THAT OUR STATUTE SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS IF IT READ  IN CONTROVERSIES AFFECTING REAL ESTATE POSSESSION OF PART OF THE LAND COVERED BY HIS

SUCH AS OUGHT TO FIND A WARM WELCOME IN AMERICA IN THE STRUGGLE FOR INDUSTRIAL SUPREMACY TECHNICAL EDUCATION SEEMS DESTINED TO PLAY AN INCREASING PART IT IS THE POPULAR BELIEF THAT TO ITS EXCELLENT TECHNICAL SCHOOLS GERMANY OWES A LARGE PART OF ITS MANUFACTURING PRESTIGE WHILE THAT GREAT BRITAIN SECURE IN ITS POSI TION HAS NEGLECTED THIS FACTOR OF INDUSTRIAL GROWTH BUT WHAT WAS TRUE TEN YEARS

UNQUESTIONABLY OUR GREATEST COMMERCIAL PROGRESS IN THE FUTURE WILL BE IN SECURING A LARGER SHARE IN THE GROWING TRADE OF ASIA AND SOUTH AMERICA AND FOR THIS REASON ANY BOOK THAT HELPS US TO UNDERSTAND THE TRADE CONDITIONS OF EITHER OF THESE REGIONS WILL BE OF SERVICE IN THE  FUTURE TRADE IN THE FAR EAST  THE LEADING COMMERCIAL CITIES OF JAPAN CHINA SIAM THE BRITISH EAST INDIES AND INDIA ARE BRIEFLY DISCUSSED FROM THE STANDPOINT OF THEIR PRESENT AND PROBABLE TRADE WITH ENGLAND THE AUTHORS ATTEMPT WAS A MODEST ONE AND HE HAS ESSAYED TO PRESENT ONLY A FEW FACTS REGARDING EACH CITY AND COUN TRY MENTIONED WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS SAID IS WELL CHOSEN AND THE CHIEF FAULT OF THE BOOK IS ITS BREVITY THE FOREIGN TRADE OF JAPAN AND CHINA IS CERTAIN TO INCREASE AS THE RESULTS OF THE TREATY OF SHIMO NOSEKI AND THE COMMERCIAL TREATIES WHICH JAPAN IS MAKING WITH ENG LAND THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER NATIONS AND IF MR WAKEFIELDS CONCLUSIONS ARE CORRECT THIS TRADE IS TO BE A DIRECT ONE BETWEEN PRO DUCER AND CONSUMER THE TENDENCY HE SAYS  IS IN EVERY INSTANCE TO THROW OFF THE YOKE OF THE INTERMEDIARY TRADER AND TO DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE PRODUCER AND THIS TENDENCY IS ESPECIALLY PRESENT IN THE MINDS OF BOTH NATIVE AND FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS WHOSE INTERESTS LIE IN CHINA AND JAPAN ALTHOUGH THE AUTHOR FINDS EVIDENCES OF SOMETHING AKIN TO COMMERCIAL REVOLUTION  IN JAPAN AND ELSEWHERE HE BELIEVES  THERE IS STILL A VAST SCOPE FOR THE PROFITABLE EMPLOYMENT OF FOREIGN MONEY AND ENTERPRISE  SHORT STUDIES IN PARTY POIRTICS T IS MADE UP OF A SERIES OF ARTICLES ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED IN SCRIBNERS

IT IN ENGLAND OF RECENT GROWTH IT HAD NOT HARDENED INTO AN INSTITUTION WHEN SOME TWENTY YEARS AGO THE LABOR QUESTION ASSUMED SO MARKED A PLACE IN THE POLITICAL AND SOCIAL LIFE OF THE EMPIRE VAGUELY UNDERSTOOD AND OFTEN SUSPECTED AS AN IMPORTATION AND NOT AN ORGANIC GROWTH THE UNIONS HAD TO CONTEND WITH MANY DIFFICULTIES ON THE ONE HAND SOCIALISM ENTICED THE LABOR ERS WITH THE PROMISE OF AN EASIER WAY TO HAPPINESS WHILE THE STATE WITH ITS PATRIARCHAL TENDENCIES HEMMED IN RATHER THAN ENCOURAGED THESE OUTGROWTHS OF PRIVATE INITIATIVE BETWEEN THE TWO OPPOSING FORCES THE UNIONS HAVE GROWN SLOWLY AND HAVE BROUGHT FORTH FEW FRUITS DR HIRSCH DEPICTS THE VICISSITUDES OF THIS GROWTH AND SEEKS TO DEMON STRATE THAT THOUGH THESE FRUITS MAY BE FAR INFERIOR IN QUANTITY THEY ARE SIMILAR IN KIND TO THOSE PRODUCED IN ENGLAND THIS LINE OF ARGUMENT AFFORDS AN ADMIRABLE OPPORTUNITY TO EXHIBIT THE STRENGTH OF UNIONISM A TASK WHICH THE AUTHOR ACCOMPLISHES WITH A MASTER HAND DR CARI ALFRED SCHMID

UNIVERSITY DURING THE YEARS 188586 THOUGH A PROFESSOR OF HISTORY SEELEY REGARDED HIMSELF AS IN THE FIELD OF AN HISTORIAN WHEN HE DISCUSSED POLITICAL SCIENCE AS WELL AS WHEN HE PRE SENTED SOME PERIOD OF HISTORY IT IS HIS DOCTRINE THAT  HISTORY WITH OUT POLITICAL SCIENCE HAS NO FRUIT POLITICAL SCIENCE WITHOUT HISTORY HAS NO ROOT TAKING THE STATES WHICH HAVE APPEARED IN THE WORLD AS HISTORY SHOWS THEM TO US HE ATTEMPTS TO TREAT THEM AS A BOTANIST WOULD TREAT THE PLANTS WHICH NATURE GIVES HIM STATES ARE TO BE CONSIDERED AS NATURAL GROWTHS THEY ARE ORGANISMS THE DUTY OF POLITICAL SCIENCE IS TO EXPLAIN THEM NOT TO START WITH A TPRIORI CONCEP TION OF WHAT A STATE OUGHT TO BE IN OTHER WORDS TRUE PROGRESS IN POLITICAL SCIENCE IS TO BE MADE BY THE INDUCTIVE METHOD THE FIRST TASK OF THE SCIENCE IS CLASSIFICATION AND IT IS TO THIS THAT SEELEY EN TIRELY DEVOTES HIS ATTENTION HE FINDS THREE STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT THE TRIBAL STATE THE THEOCRATIC STATE AND THE STATE PROPER DEPENDING RESPECTIVELY ON THE THREE STATE MOTIVES KINSHIP RELIGION AND IN TEREST BESIDES THE STATES WHICH MAY BE SO CLASSIFIED THERE EXISTS CERTAIN QUASISTATES OR INORGANIC STATES WHICH ARE HELD TOGETHER BY FORCE AND ARE USUALLY THE RESULT OF CONQUEST THE AUTHOR CONSIDERS THE VARIOUS TERMS WHICH WERE INTRODUCED BY ARISTOTLE AS ENTIRELY INADEQUATE AND MISLEADING WHEN APPLIED TO MOST OF THE FORMS OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAVE APPEARED AND MAKES THE FOLLOWING CLASSIFICATIONS CITY STATES AND COUNTRY STATES ATHENS BEING A TYPE OF THE FORMER AND ANY GREAT EUROPEAN NATION OF THE LATTER CENTRALIZED AND DECENTRALIZED STATES

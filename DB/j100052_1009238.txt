j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1009238,Notes,i242510,BOOK DEPARTMENT NOTES PROF JOHANNES CONRAD Of the University of Halle Germany has just published a new and enlarged edition of Part I of his  Grundriss zumn Studium der Nationalikonomie  which was pre pared originally for distribution among his students as a substitute for the dictation previously given at each lecture In its present shape it is intended to meet the needs of a larger public as well Part I contains the outlines of lectures on theoretical political economy the other parts which are to follow will deal with practical economic problems and statistics The book is quite readable throughout and a thoughtful person will find in it more than an ordinary syllabus The definitions are prepared with great care and the bibliographical references are wellselected up to date and very complete It is not difficult from these outlines to get at Professor Conrads point of view on the fundamental questions of value price population and money His vigorous hold on the best German and foreign literature of his subject combined with a calm moderate eclectic temperament make his views such as ought to find a warm welcome in America IN THE STRUGGLE for industrial supremacy technical education seems destined to play an increasing part It is the popular belief that to its excellent technical schools Germany owes a large part of its manufacturing prestige while that Great Britain secure in its posi tion has neglected this factor of industrial growth But what was true ten years ago is no longer the fact A recent report of the Bel gian Ministry of Industry and Labor t furnishes conclusive evidence of the enormous progress made in this regard in Great Britain in recent years Dr Oscar Pyfferoen of the University of Ghent was commissioned by the Ministry to study technical education in Eng land and this comprehensive and careful report is the result of his labors The body of the book is devoted to the legislative and administrative basis of the system and to a description of a large number of institutions As the facts are accessible to our readers in the Report Eighth Annual of the United States Bureau of Labor on  Grundriss zum Studium der folitischen Oekonomie I Teil National5konomie Von Prof Dr J CONRAD PP 79 Jena Gustav Fischer 1896 t Rappert sur lenseignement

excellent introduction Dr Pyfferoen happily characterizes the function of the technical school as twofoldto remedy the evils brought about by the decline of apprenticeship and to acquaint the workingman with the general notions of his trade in order that he may labor plore intelligently and be competent to perform all the operations of this or cognate industries With a laboring population so trained many of the difficulties which the uncertainty of modern industry brings with it would be overcome Belgium he tells us in conclusion cannot neglect to profit by the experience of her neigh bors and that she may not retrograde in the competitive struggle he suggests an organization of technical education not unlike the Eng lish though adapted to local conditions THE DATA of economic geography are in large part derived from geology and physical geography It is rare that information of this kind is presented in a form so fascinating as that in which Major Powell has described the Colorado River basin in his book on the Canyons of the Colorado  The explorations of this region made by Major Powell from 186972 and the reports published by the Smithsonian Institution are known to all students of geology but are not familiar to many others The present volume gives a nontech nical account of the Colorado country by publishing the diary kept by Major Powell in the summer of 1869 The diary is printed as it was written in the present tense and in it geography often takes the form of thrilling tales of adventure The diary comprises chapters VXIV of the book the first four chapters and the last being devoted to a geieral description of the physical features of the Colo rado basin Throughout the narrative frequent references are made to the Indian tribes inhabiting the region and thus the book contains an account of the present condition and past civilization of these interesting pueblobuilding aborigines Every reader of Major Powells writings knows the charm of his style but in the present volume his descriptions are rendered more than usually vivid by a wealth of excellent illustrations The book is an artistic volume as readable and instructive as it is beautiful THE WAR between Japan and China came at a time when the United States because of industrial conditions at home was giving more than usual attention to the development of foreign trade

Unquestionably our greatest commercial progress in the future will be in securing a larger share in the growing trade of Asia and South America and for this reason any book that helps us to understand the trade conditions of either of these regions will be of service In the  Future Trade in the Far East  the leading commercial cities of Japan China Siam the British East Indies and India are briefly discussed from the standpoint of their present and probable trade with England The authors attempt was a modest one and he has essayed to present only a few facts regarding each city and coun try mentioned What the author has said is well chosen and the chief fault of the book is its brevity The foreign trade of Japan and China is certain to increase as the results of the treaty of Shimo noseki and the commercial treaties which Japan is making with Eng land the United States and other nations and if Mr Wakefields conclusions are correct this trade is to be a direct one between pro ducer and consumer The tendency he says  is in every instance to throw off the yoke of the intermediary trader and to deal directly with the producer and this tendency is especially present in the minds of both native and foreign manufacturers whose interests lie in China and Japan Although the author finds evidences of something akin to commercial revolution  in Japan and elsewhere he believes  there is still a vast scope for the profitable employment of foreign money and enterprise  SHORT STUDIES IN PARTY PoIrTICS t is made up of a series of articles originally published in Scribners Mlagazine These papers present in a most readable manner an analysis of the principles and tendencies of political parties rather than a study of party machinery Throughout the work are to be found interesting allusions to men prominent at different times in the history of the nation The value of the studies is enhanced because of the personal acquaintance of the author with the men and measures of a great part of the period The twentyseven portraits of presidents and statesmen copied from highly prized photographs and paintings form a unique feature of the book DR MAX HIRSCH the enthusiastic

Trade Unions in England and Germany which originally appeared in the Jahrbuch fiir vergleichende Rechtswissen schafl The movement is far from having attained in Germany the importance which belongs to it in England Of recent growth it had not hardened into an institution when some twenty years ago the labor question assumed so marked a place in the political and social life of the empire Vaguely understood and often suspected as an importation and not an organic growth the unions had to contend with many difficulties On the one hand Socialism enticed the labor ers with the promise of an easier way to happiness while the state with its patriarchal tendencies hemmed in rather than encouraged these outgrowths of private initiative Between the two opposing forces the unions have grown slowly and have brought forth few fruits Dr Hirsch depicts the vicissitudes of this growth and seeks to demon strate that though these fruits may be far inferior in quantity they are similar in kind to those produced in England This line of argument affords an admirable opportunity to exhibit the strength of unionism a task which the author accomplishes with a master hand DR CARI ALFRED SCHMID has had the courage to prepare for Ger man readers a Digest of the Report of the Royal Commission as a contri bution to the history of labor  With infinite patience he has delved through the voluminous report and presented here its main features His work has been chiefly that of selecting and condensing the evidence from the great mass of material He does indeed at the close of each topic give a brief r6sum6 and some ten pages toward the close of the book summarize the authors conclusions but he has effaced himself and allowed others to speak through his words A complete system of references indicates precisely the source of all facts and opinions cited The main portion of the book treats of wages hours of labor and the general standard of life of the laborer while an appendix summarizes the testimony in regard to the actual condi tion of cooperative enterprises The book might have been entitled a  Guide to the Report of the Labor Commission and as such will prove of permanent usefulness to students THE PUBLICATIONS of the Musde Social give promise of consider able value notably to students of the labor question in all its phases Thus a recent circular No I Series

on important topics An ample bibliography gives for the various countries a list of laws and of parliamentary and official docu ments as well as other works which relate to labor accidents Another

digest of the debates on the eighthour day womens labor over hours and kindred topics It closes with a biographical sketch of Thomas Burt M P who presided over the Congress and who has long been known as a leader in labor matters in England  INTRODUCTION TO POLITICAL SCIENCE  is the somewhat mislead ing title of a volume of sixteen lectures delivered by the late Professor Seeley of Cambridge University during the years 188586 Though a professor of history Seeley regarded himself as in the field of an historian when he discussed political science as well as when he pre sented some period of history It is his doctrine that  History with out Political Science has no fruit Political Science without History has no root Taking the states which have appeared in the world as history shows them to us he attempts to treat them as a botanist would treat the plants which nature gives him States are to be considered as natural growths They are organisms The duty of political science is to explain them not to start with a tpriori concep tion of what a state ought to be In other words true progress in political science is to be made by the inductive method The first task of the science is classification and it is to this that Seeley en tirely devotes his attention He finds three stages of development the tribal state the theocratic state and the state proper depending respectively on the three state motives kinship religion and in terest Besides the states which may be so classified there exists certain quasistates or inorganic states which are held together by force and are usually the result of conquest The author considers the various terms which were introduced by Aristotle as entirely inadequate and misleading when applied to most of the forms of government which have appeared and makes the following classifications city states and country states Athens being a type of the former and any great European nation of the latter centralized and decentralized states states having a large province and states having a small province states having a government making organ and those which have not states where power is in one hand  Introduction to Political Science

democracy are treated and it is said that there is no opposition between the principles there is only a practical opposition of tenden cies  which may however be reconciled Though somewhat paradox ical the lectures like all of Seeleys works are interesting They contain much acute and valuable discussion of terms and a vast number of historical illustrations As might be expected much use is made of English history To one already familiar with general history this volume forms a very suggestive commentary on the forms of government which have grown up in different ages and under diverse conditions

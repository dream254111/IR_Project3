J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013017,HOW AMERICA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERMANENT PEACE OF THE WORLD,I242646,HOW AMERICA MAY CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERMANENT PEACE OF THE WORLD BY GEORGE W KIRCHWEY PHD PROFESSOR OF LAW COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HOW CAN AMERICAHOW CAN THE UNITED STATESCONTRIBUTE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THIS WAR IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE MAY HOPE FOR AN EXTENDED REIGN OF PEACE IF NOT FOR PERMANENT PEACE I WILL CONFESS TO YOU THAT I WOULD NOT HAVE COME BEFORE YOU IF I HADNT BELIEVED THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE COULD DO SOME THING THAT WE COULD PROPOSE SOME CONCRETE AIM THAT MIGHT BE PRO MOTED BY OUR ASSEMBLING HERE TONIGHT AND TALKING THIS MATTER OVER WHAT IS IT THAT WE CAN DO IN THE FIRST PLACE LET ME SAY THAT I BELIEVE IT TO BE AS TRUE TODAY AS IT WAS YESTERDAY AS TRUE IN INTERNATIONAL CONCERNS AS IT IS IN ALL OUR OTHER AFFAIRS THAT THE KINGDOM OF HEAVEN CANNOT BE TAKEN BY STORM WE SHALL NOT BY ANY TRICK OR DEVICE OF STATESMANSHIP ACHIEVE A PERMANENT AND ENDURING PEACE AT THE END OF THIS WAR IF WE SHALL HAVE ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF PERMANENT PEACE BY A SINGLE STAGE ON THE LONG JOURNEY THAT LIES BETWEEN US AND UTOPIA WE SHALL HAVE DONE WELL I HAVE SPENT MUCH TIME DURING THE LAST FEW MONTHS WITH SOME ARDENT SPIRITSLOVERS OF PEACE MEN AND WOMEN OF GOOD WILLIN THE HOPE OF DETERMINING HOW BEST WE CAN BRING THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE UNITED STATES TO BEAR WITH A VIEW TO THE TERMINATION OF THE WAR WHEN THE PROPER TIME FOR THAT SHALL SEEM TO HAVE ARRIVED AND WITH A VIEW TO AIDING IN THE CREATION OF A PUBLIC SENTIMENT IN EUROPE WHICH WILL RESULT IN A DECENT MAGNANIMOUS AND NOT A PRED ATORY AND DEFECTIVE PEACE A PEACE WHICH WILL NOT SOW DRAGONS TEETH OF FUTURE WARS AND WHICH SHALL ALSO PICTURE TO THE BANKRUPT STATESMANSHIP OF EUROPE THE DESIRABILITY OF NATIONS LIVING TOGETHER IN CONCORD PERHAPS EVEN OF MODELING THEIR INSTITUTIONS MORE UPON THOSE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED ON THIS SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC LOOKING FORWARD TOWARD THAT FEDERATION OF THE WORLD TO WHICH THE POET HAS POINTED THE WAY BUT THE MORE I WORK WITH THESE GROUPS OF INCUR ABLE OPTIMISTS THE MORE CONVINCED I BECOME THAT SALVATION DOES NOT LIE IN ANY ATTEMPT TO REALIZE SUCH LARGE AIMS AS THAT IN SUCH A DIRECT 230PERMANENT PEACE OF THE WORLD AND IMMEDIATE WAY I FEEL MORE AND MORE THAT THE PROBLEM IS ONE OF CIVILIZATION THE PROCESS THAT WILL LEAD US TO PEACE AND CIVILIZATION IS A LONG PROCESS ONE IN THE EDUCATION OF EXPERIENCE BUT IN THE MEANTIME WHAT CAN WE DO TO FORWARD IT LET ME MENTION ONE THING THAT I THINK WE SHOULD NOT DO I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES SHOULD JOIN WITH ANY POWER OR GROUP OF POWERS IN EUROPE WITH A VIEW TO MAIN TAINING THE PEACE OF THE WORLD BY THE SWORD IN THE FIRST PLACE I BELIEVE PROFOUNDLY IN THE TRUTH OF THE SAYING THAT HE WHO TAKES THE SWORD SHALL PERISH BY THE SWORD I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT ANY GOOD THING IS EVER ACCOMPLISHED BY VIOLENCE IN THE SECOND PLACE IF IT IS A GOOD THING FOR EUROPE TO MAINTAIN PEACE BY MILITARY FORCE IT IS A GOOD THING FOR US TO KEEP OUT OF IT HAS BEEN WELL SAID THAT THE GOVERNMENTS OF THE WORLD ARE IN A WAY SUPERFLUOUS IF NOT ARTIFICIAL SURVIVALS FROMWAS IT THE STONE AGE SOME PREHISTORIC PERIOD ANYWAY THAT THE REAL GOVERNMENT OF THE WORLD IS AN INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT MADE UP OF THE GREAT INDUS TRIAL AND INTELLECTUAL AND MORAL FORCES WHICH ACTUALLY CONTROL THE ACTIONS OF MEN SUPERIMPOSED UPON THIS INVISIBLE GOVERNMENT WE HAVE THESE RELICS OF MEDIAEVALISM OUR POLITICAL AND MILITARY GOVERN MENTS WHICH HAVE VERY LITTLE FUNCTION LEFT EXCEPTING TO PLUNGE INTO CHAOS THIS MODERN WORLD WHICH THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE WORLDTHE MODERN WORLDHAS BECOME A GREAT INDUSTRIAL COMMON WEALTH ONE SINGLE WEB WOVEN OF A THOUSAND MILLION STRANDS OF MUTUAL INTERESTS AND MUTUAL SYMPATHIES AND THE QUESTION FOR US IS WHAT CAN WE THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES DO TO PRESERVE THE INTEGRITY OF THAT WEB I BELIEVE IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT WE CAN BEST DO IT BY KEEPING OUR OWN PART OF THE WEB FROM DISINTEGRATION I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BEST DO IT BY MAINTAINING OUR TRADITION OF PEACE AND OUR HABIT OF PEACEFUL LIVING BY SETTING OUR FACES RESOLUTELY AGAINST EVERY INCITE MENT TO MILITARISM FROM WHATEVER SOURCE IT MAY COME BY REFUSING TO BE STIRRED BY PANIC CRIES OF DANGER WHEN THERE IS NO DANGER BY REMEMBERING THAT FROM OUR GEOGRAPHICAL POSITION FROM OUR RELATIONS OF AMITY WITH THE WHOLE WORLD WE ARE AS SAFE FROM ATTACK AS ANY NA TION EVER HAS BEEN IN HUMAN HISTORY THE POINT THAT I WISH TO INSIST UPON IS THIS THAT WE MUST NOT BE DRIVEN BY PANIC INTO ADOPTING AN ATTITUDE OF MILITARISM TOWARDS THE REST OF THE WORLD AS THE NATIONS OF EUROPE WERE DRIVEN BY PANIE INTO THE MILITARISM WHICH FINALLY 231THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY RESULTED IN THIS WAR IN THAT WAY DESTRUCTION LIES AND NOTHING BUT DESTRUCTION WE ARE THEN TO MAINTAIN OUR POSITION AS A PACIFIC PEACELOVING PEOPLE AND IN THE SECOND PLACE WE ARE BY VIRTUE OF OUR POSITION IN THE WORLD THE GREAT NEUTRAL AS WELL AS THE GREAT PACIFIC POWER AS SUCH WE OWE TO ALL OTHER NEUTRAL PEOPLES A DUTYTHE DUTY OF LEADING THEM IN THE WAYS OF PEACEOF COOPERATING WITH THEM IN THE GREAT WORK OF MAKING THE WORLD A WORLD IN WHICH A NATION SHALL BE FREE TO LEAD A PEACEFUL LIFE WITHOUT UNDUE INTERFERENCE FROM NATIONS THAT ARE STILL DOMINATED BY THE WAR SPIRIT AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THIS DUTY CANNOT BE PROPERLY DISCHARGED BY US IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK ALONE AND FOR THE PROTECTION SOLELY OF OUR OWN NATIONAL INTER ESTS IT REQUIRES US TO GET INTO CLOSE WORKING RELATIONS WITH ALL OTHER NEUTRAL PEOPLES TO ENTER INTO CONFERENCE WITH THEM WITH A VIEW TO COMMON CONCERTED ACTION FOR THE PROTECTION OF NEUTRAL RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN THE THIRD PLACE WE ARE IN A PECULIAR SENSE TRUSTEES OF ONE OF THE CHIEF GOODS OF CIVILIZATION THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE WORLD THAT BODY OF RULES AND PRINCIPLES WHICH REPRESENTS WHAT GLADSTONE CALLED THE PUBLIC RIGHT OF EUROPE AND THE CIVILIZED WORLDPERHAPS THE GREATEST ACHIEVEMENT OF THE INTERNATIONAL MIND DURING THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS THIS PUBLIC RIGHT HAS NO SANCTION IN THE STRICT LEGAL SENSE NO MILITARY FORCE NO INTERNATIONAL POLICE STANDS BEHIND IT TO GIVE IT POWER IT RESTS SOLELY UPON THE PUBLIC OPINION OF THE CIVILIZED WORLDAND THE PUBLIC OPINION OF HALF THE WORLD IS PARALYZED BY WAR AND THAT OF THE OTHER HALF IS BENUMBED BY FEAR OR BY INDIF FERENCE IT IS FOR US I BELIEVE TO COME OUT INTO THE DAYLIGHT TO TAKE OUR PLACE IN THE SUN AND TO STAND FOR THESE VIOLATED PRINCIPLES OF INTERNATIONAL LAW TO THE END THAT PUBLIC RIGHT SHALL NOT PERISH FROM THE EARTH THEN LASTLY THERE IS ANOTHER FUNCTION WHICH THE UNITED STATES MAY WELL PERFORM WE ARE ON TERMS OF GROWING INTIMACY ARISING OUT OF A GROWING UNDERSTANDING WITH THE OTHER REPUBLICS OF THIS WESTERN WORLD IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHALL DO MORE FOR THE CAUSE OF DURABLE PEACE IF WE BEGIN BY CREATING AN INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY IN THE AMERICAS WHICH SHALL BE HELD TOGETHER BY THE BINDING TIES OF PEACE AMITY MUTUAL INTEREST AND GOODWILL IN OTHER WORDS I DO BELIEVE IN A LEAGUE OF PEACE PROVIDED IT IS A LEAGUE OF PEACE IN WHICH IT IS PROPOSED TO LIVE BY PEACE AND NOT BY WAR AND IT SEEMS 232PERMANENT PEACE OF THE WORLD TO ME THAT WE ARE IN A POSITION TO CREATE SUCH A LEAGUE PERHAPS FIRST AMONG THE REPUBLICS OF THIS WESTERN HEMISPHERE THE LATIN AMERICAN STATES WITH OURSELVES AND THEN NEXT WITH ALL OTHER NEUTRAL POWERS OR RATHER SHALL I SAY ALL OTHER PACIFIC POWERS THOSE THAT HAVE LAID ASIDE IF THEY EVER CHERISHED THE FATAL AMBITIONS OF NATIONAL GREAT NESS TO BE PROMOTED BY VIOLENCE AND FORCE WHICH HAVE BROUGHT THE GREATER PART OF EUROPE TO ITS PRESENT PASS THEREFORE I PROPOSE AS THE METHODS BY WHICH WE MAY HOPE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE PERMANENT PEACE OF THE WORLD FIRST THAT WE SHALL AT ALL HAZARDS AND IN THE FACE OF ALL DOMINIONS AND POWERS STEADFASTLY MAINTAIN OUR HONORABLE POSITION AS A PACIFIC NATION A NATION THAT SEEKS HER ENDS BY THE RIGHTEOUS WAYS OF PERSUASION AND GOODWILL AND NOT BY FORCE OF ARMS SECOND THAT WE SHALL AS SOON AS POSSIBLE ENTER INTO CLOSE RELATIONS OF AMITY AND IF POSSIBLE INTO A DURABLE LEAGUE OF PEACE WITH THE OTHER STATES OF THE WESTERN WORLD THIRD THAT WE SHALL WITHOUT DELAY ENTER INTO CONFERENCE WITH A VIEW TO SOME SUCH PERMANENT RELATION WITH EVERY OTHER NEUTRAL AND PACIFIC POWER AND LASTLY THAT WE SHALL DO EVERYTHING THAT LIES IN OUR POWER TO BUILD A NEW INTERNATIONAL LAW REMEMBERING THAT THE WORLDTHE REAL WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE AND MOVE AND HAVE OUR BEINGHAS BECOME INDUSTRIAL AND THEREFORE PEACEFUL AND THAT WARONCE THE NORMAL CONDITION OF MANHAS BECOME ABNORMAL AN ANACHRONISM TO BE OUTLAWED AND THEREFORE THAT THIS NEW INTERNA TIONAL LAW SHALL NOT BE WRITTEN AS INTERNATIONAL LAW HAS HERETOFORE BEEN WRITTEN BY BELLIGERENTS FOR BELLIGERENTS BUT THAT IT SHALL BE WRITTEN FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE NEUTRAL POWERS AND IN THE INTERESTS OF NEUTRALITY AND PEACE WHAT THAT MAY MEAN IN THE WAY OF ENLARGING THE ISLES OF SAFETY IN THE WORLD THE AREAS OF LAND AND WATER PERMANENTLY DEDICATED TO PEACE WHAT IN THE WAY OF FREEING NEUTRAL COMMERCE NO ONE CAN YET SAY NOR CAN WE HAVE ANY ASSUR ANCE THAT WE SHALL BE PERMITTED TO PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE CONFERENCE WHICH WILL SETTLE THE TERMS OF PEACE AT THE CLOSE OF THIS WAR BUT THIS AT LEAST IS CERTAIN THAT WE CANNOT BE EXCLUDED FROM ANY CONFERENCE WHICH SHALL SETTLE THE INTERNATIONAL LAW OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD AND IT WILL BE THERE THAT WE SHALL MAKE OUR IMPRESS AND EXERT A REAL INFLUENCE IN THE DIRECTION OF AN ENDURING PEACE YOU WILL OBSERVE THAT THIS IS A MODEST PROGRAM THAT IT DOES NOT BRING US VERY CLOSE TO THE MILLENNIUM IT WILL TAKE US ONLY A STEP OR TWO IN THAT DIRECTION I CONCEIVE THAT THERE WILL STILL BE WARS AND 233234 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY RUMORS OF WAR IN THE YEARS TO COME BUT I HOPE AND BELIEVE THAT THE EUROPE THAT WILL EMERGE FROM THIS CATASTROPHE WILL BE A CHASTENED EUROPE AND THAT THE BELLIGERENT NATIONS WILL MAKE A SERIOUS EFFORT TO LIVE TOGETHER AND LITTLE BY LITTLE FORM THE HABIT OF LIVING TOGETHER IN PEACE AND AMITY BUT WHETHER THAT COMES ABOUT OR NOT AND WHETHER WE CAN BY OUR EXAMPLE AND PRECEPT CONTRIBUTE TO THAT END OR NOT THE FACT REMAINS THAT IT RESTS WHOLLY WITH US TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE SHALL BE A PACIFIC NATION IN THE FUTURE AS WE HAVE BEEN MAINLY IN THE PAST AND WHETHER WE SHALL OR SHALL NOT EXTEND THE AREA OF PEACE BY DRAWING WITHIN THE CIRCLE OF OUR AMITY AND CONCORD THE SOUTH AND CENTRAL AMERICAN STATES AND THE OTHER NATIONS OF THE WORLD THAT CHOOSE TO WALK HAND IN HAND WITH US IN THE WAYS OF PEACE

j100000,Science,1638793,The Napier Tercentenary Celebration,i296332,SCIENCE interest as that of signals So far as is yet known the natural electric waves reaching wireless telegraph stations in latitudes higher than 50 appear to travel mostly from the south Thus the greatest changes produced in strays by the eclipse will probably be experi enced at stations in Scandinavia and Russia to reach which the waves must cross the path of the umbra At the same time changes of some kind are to be expected in other districts than these and it is therefore desirable that statistical observations of natural electric waves be made all over the world and espe cially at places within an earth quadrant of southern Russia It is also desirable that meteorological observations including those of atmospheric ionization and potential gra dient should be at the disposal of the com mittee when considering the records of strays and signals The committee proposes to prepare and cir culate special forms for the collection of sta tistics of signals and strays especially within the hemisphere likely to be affected by the eclipse they will endeavor to make provision for the transmission of special signals at times to be indicated on the forms and they will offer for the consideration of the authorities controlling stations near the central line a simple program of work The discussion of the observations and the comparison with meteorological data will be carried out by the committee and digests of the statistics to gether with the conclusions drawn from the analysis will be published in due course The committee would be greatly aided in the organization of this investigation if those possessing the necessary facilities and willing to make observations during the eclipse would communicate with the honorable secretary Dr W Eccles University College London W C at the earliest possible date THE NAPIE TERCENTENARY CELEBRA TION JOHN NAPIERS Logarithmorum Canonis Mirifici Descriptio was published in 1614 and it is proposed to celebrate the tercentenary of this great event in the history of mathe matics by a congress to be held in Edinburgh on Friday July 24 1914 and following days The celebration is being held under the aus pices of the Royal Society of Edinburgh on whose invitation a general committee has been formed representing the Royal Society of London the Royal Astronomical Society the town council of Edinburgh the faculty of actuaries the Royal Philosophical Society of Glasgow the universities of St Andrews Glasgow Aberdeen and Edinburgh the Uni versity College of Dundee and many other bodies and institutions of educational impor tance Through the favor of the editor of SCIENm the president and council of the Royal Society of Edinburgh have now the honor of giving a general invitation to mathematicians and others interested in this coming celebration The celebration will be opened on the Friday with an inaugural address by Lord of Appeal Sir J Fletcher Moulton FRS LLD Edin followed by a reception given by the Right Honorable the lord provost magistrates and council of the city of Edinburgh On the Saturday and Monday the historical and present practise of computation and other developments closely connected with Napiers discoveries and inventions will be discussed A memorial service will be held in St Giles Cathedral on the Sunday Among many who have expressed a warm interest in the celebration and who hope to take part in the congress may be mentioned Professor Andoyer Paris Professor J Bauschinger Strassburg Professor IHume

the wellknown public school which draws pupils from all parts of the British empire The governors of 639 MAY 1 1914N S VOL XXXIX No 1009 the school have kindly invited the members of the congress to visit the castle and grounds on the Saturday afternoon Relics of Napier collected by Lord Napier and Ettrick and other representatives of the family will also be on view and it is intended to bring together for exhibition books of tables and forms of calculating machines which may reasonably be regarded as natural devel opments of the great advance made by Napier Individuals societies universities public libraries etc may become founder members on payment of a minimum subscription of 2 and each founder mnber will receive a copy of the memorial volume which will contain addresses and papers read before the congress and other material of historic and scientific value It is important to secure as many founder members as possible so that a volume may be brought out worthy of the memory of Napier Ordinary subscribers attending the celebra tion may receive copies of the memorial volume at a reduced price Subscriptions and donations should be sent to the honorary treasurer Mr Adam Tail Royal Bank of Scotland St Andrew Square Edinburgh All who are interested in this proposed cele bration are respectfully invited to communi cate with the general secretary of the Royal

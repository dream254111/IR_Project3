in Dauphin County Pennsylvania,i241968,ARTICLE VIII Notice of Fossil Arborescent Ferns of the Family of Sigillaria and other Coal Plants exhibited in the Roof and Floor of a Coal Seam in Dauphin County Pennsylvania by Richard C Taylor F G S tc Read May 30th 1843 I AM desirous of placing on record a description of certain remarkably developed specimens of vegetable fossils of great magnitude which have come under my observa tion in the most southern of our Pennsylvania Coal Fields It is not often that pre sentations on such a scale can be studied so advantageously as in the present instance I willingly admit that they merit description from a much more accomplished naturalist than myself Those now about to be described are or were displayed during the progress of work ing a Gallery or Drift several hundred feet in length in a Coal bed to which the name of  Perseverance Vein  has been given Its position is towards the western extremity of the Schuylkill Coal Field thirteen miles east from the Susquehanna River I should have felt less disposition to enter upon this task had detailed descriptions of interesting exposures of coal vegetation on an enlarged scaleacquired during the pro gress of practical operations in our mninesbeen more frequently furnished to science For illustrations of this instructive character we in vain search among authorities which are recognised as of the very highest scientific reputation Their specimens selected for illustration generally represent but a minute section a mere fragment of these gigantic plants and are limited to the exhibition of the characters of their bark or of their leaves But these samples transmit to us no conceptions of the actual scale the true magnitude to which this magnificent flora attains any more than a single brick conveys an adequate idea of the architecture of a building M A Brougniart himself the author of a standard treatise on fossil vegetables became fully aware of the necessity for calling the geologists to his aid ere he could perfect the splendid work which he has communicated to the scientific worldt  No one knows better than myself he exclaims the difficulties inherent to such a subject anid the imperfections impossible to avoid which may be found in the work which I publish This work will present only the first rough sketch of the vegetation of the ancient world  Length of excavation five hundred and fiftyeight feet f Histoire des egetatix Fossiles par M Adolphe Brougniart220 FOSSIL COAL PLANTS and it will be still many years before we can trace a more perfect picture To achieve such a result it is necessary that the geologists and the botanists should unite their efforts in order that nione of the objects requisite to enlighten a subject so difficult should be neglected It rarely happens that the persons who are practically employed in coal mines regard the fossil flora by which they are surrounded as in a museum with sufficient interest to take adequate note of the natural objects which from time to time present themselves In fact they are from obvious circumstances unfitted for observation or rather for noting with that degree of precision that commends itself to our confidence Upon the geologists but more especially upon those among them who direct the ex plorations of our mines the charge mainly devolves of observing and recording the phe nomiena of fossil vegetation as they are brought to view from the depths and darkness of the earth Upon these instructed observers rests the interesting duty of communicating intelligence respecting those long buried productions of nature which they have assisted in developingr on a magnificent scale within the galleries and the recesses of the mine However elaborately these specimens may at first be displayed upon thie walls of our coal veins those who are practically engaged there well know how soon those relics are defaced or despoiled of their freshness and beauty by the operations which are there incessantly carried on by the miner and his assistants Sensible of this and with a view to the preservation upon paper at least of the magnificent memorials which I am about to describe I have made it a special object during upwards of a year to trace out on the most extended scale that the works permitted to make admeasurements to preserve specimens and to take drawings from day to day as the excavations proceeded and the fossils were laid bare of whatever details might afford instruction relative to the character of this ancient flora The result of this labour is now before the present meeting The coal of the bed in question is in the transition state often denominated semi bituminous that is to say it contains upwards of sixteen per cent of volatile matter Its position is highly inclined dipping not less than seventy degrees to the north Se veral other smaller coal seams occur in this locality the Third or Sharp Mountain alternating with a countless series of conglomerates grits sandstones argillaceous shales and fire clay all inclining northward at from seventy to seventynine degrees Nearly every one of the numerous coal seams we have explored in this quarteroften very small and consequently unprofitable for workinghas a floor of soft slate or fire clay and a roof of coarse siliceous conglomerate This fact is distinctly exhibited in the two sections and in the ground plan which accompany this memorialt The conglomerate or puddingstone spoken of is compact and dense it is extremely difficult to blast and  Proportions

to their cost who have had to pass through it by drifts or shafts The direction or level course of this vein in the gangway is from 190 to 250 to the northward of east that is to say commencing in a course north 64I east it sweeps round to north 710 east It will be sufficient for our purpose when speaking of bearings to limit our description simply to the cardinal points Between the north and south walls the interval is eight or nine feet of which space five and a half feet consist of coal divided in the midst by a seam two or three feet thick of fire clay Along the course therefore of this coal seam and bounded by its walls the exploratory gallery hias been pursued With so high an inclination as seventy degrees these walls are not unsuitably disposed for the purposes of the mine and are especially adapted to the display of the vegetable fossils which appear like pictures sus pended from a wall on either hand I have said thus much in explanation of local details because without them our posi tion could not be utnderstood It has been stated that all the principal coal seams known to me in this vicinity have floors of argillaceous matter called the bottom slate and roofs of conglomerate rock In the present instance these lower slates comprising two thin seams of coal and some thin beds of argillaceous sandstone are seventeen feet thick before reaching the next conglomerate on that side Turning to the north the bare wall of conglomerate formns the hanging side of the coal seam without any separatingn matter between it and the coal except from two to four inches of shale called by the miners the top slate This is commonly stripped down in the process of excavating the coal as the slate here parts rnore readily from the rock than the coal separates from the slate moreover the solid rock forms a safer wall than does the loose shale Occasionally as in other veins we lhave traced the conglomerate even comes in contact with the coal itself exhibiting the form of the coal vegetation upon its under surface and notwithstanding the coarseness of the materials of this rock may be often seen moulded into the configuration of the larger plants which even retain their carbonized bark The irregular space between the actual serviceable coal and its overlying pudding stone is almost entirely occupied with casts of trunks of trees lying hlorizontally that is to say parallel with the coal These preliminary explanations will I think render the losition of an observer in this gallery sufficiently intelligible As he advances forward towards the east he has the clay floor of the coal seam on his right hand sloping at a high angle towards the north while on his left facing the north the conglomerate roof or hanging wall approaches within twenty degrees of the perpendicular As in every case withiin my knowledge the upper surface of the coal and the inferior surface of the overlying rock are somewhat rough and irregular forming a remarkable contrast to the lower surface of the same coal and to the smooth and almost polished face of the subjacent slate When the circum stances which attended the slow and tranquil accunmulation of the one and the turbulent and disturbed condition of all things at the commencement of the other are taken into consideration we shall obtain a ready explanation of the irregular surfaces of all col seams which have conglomerate roofs VOL IX59222 FOSSIL COAL PLANTS TIlE SOUTH OR BOTTOM WALL After removal of the coal the slate floor presents a perfectly beautiful picture of plants and compressed trunks of large trees mostly in a well preserved state Until the face of this southern wall hias become obscure by the coal mud and lirt which rapidly accu mnulates in these thoroughfares under the operations of the miners this exhibition is sin aularly interesting and furnishes abundant opportunities for the study of fossil botany The coal vegetation thus favouirably presented belongs in a great measure to the class Sigillaria which plants are allied to the family of arborescent ferns Of these Sigillaria or tree ferns we think we can with sorne degree of probability distinguish five or six dlistinct species One other species also apparently a Sigillaria is particularly abundanit Its bark now carbonized is at least one third of an inch in thickness This being rernoved the inner surface resembles somewhat the Syringodendron organurn of Sternberg Tab xiii although this is not an uncommon character among the thick barked varieties Its longitudinal grrooves or stria are rather irregular but average half an inch irn breadth The outer bark is roughly mnarked with an obscure and coarse tissue and exhibits no distinct cicatrices Of the family of Syringodendron which also has been classed with the Sigillaires we hiave apparently one species of the Lepidodendroln of Sternbera two species of Stig mnaria otie species Fromn the shales of the outcrop of the vein we derive two or three species of Neuropteris three of Pecopteris two of Sphenopteiis and one of Calamites This list is evidently incomplete and it forms no part of my present undertakiing to prepare more than a sketchl of the subordinate class of fossil plants Among all tlhese as we have already intimated the family of Sigillaria is the most conspicuous and occupies by far the largest space These gigantic plants are all placed horizontally that is to say Iparallel to the stratification They seem to have suistainedl no injury except suchl as might accrue from being flattened under great pressure while the soft clay or argillaceous matter in which they were immersed has evidently tendecl to their preservation These stems are of very large size as is shown by the accom panying drawing Ihey cross each other in every direction and form no inconsiderable part of the mass of clay or mnud on and in which they repose Among the most re markable and beautiful of these fossils is a bifurcated species whose stemns and brarnches are uniformly bent or curved We think we recognise in this species the Sigillaria elegans of Al Brongniart These are somewhat abunidant here and we have met withl still more splendid specimens of the same species in the imperfect coal and coal shales below the upper red shale On account of the obscurity of the cicatrices in those before us baffling specific discrimination it may possibly be Sigillaria Knorrii Tab 156 whichl so nearly resembles it but the probabilities seem to favour the Sigillaria elegans the scaly markings of which are smaller and more closely approaching to our specimens A further reason for this preference is that the elegans is dichotomous and we have no evidence that the Knorrii is I r speak here from memory as these fine specimens were subsequently destroyed by fIreFOSSIL COAL PLANTS 223 The oblique position in which for thie most part these enormous stems of Sigillaria are disposed in the floor or south wall of the coal seam is unfavourable for determining their longitudinal extent nor shall we ever ascertain it until a much larger area is uncovered During the length of several hundred feet in this gallery not a single case is presented either of the commencement or the termination of a stem of Sigillaria With the exception of the one flexuous dichotomous species mentioned above the whole are singularly straight and present no apparent diminution of their breadthl towards their superior extremities Five or six of these Sigillaires have thirty feet of their length laid bare and one other has forty or fifty feet long exposed without any perceptible change in width during that space We regret the necessity of leaving so much unde termined The actual lengths of these noble trunks can only be ascertained Nwlienever in the future operations of the mitne the coal shall be more extensively removed MIore than one lhundred of these straight Sigillaria are slhown inl our drawing These are only the best defined among them selected for illustration At least double that number exist in that space but there would have been no advantage gained by intro duicing them into our sketch As to their thickness it tmay be stated that few sterns are so small as two feet wide many are three feet diameter four or five of them are four feet one or two others are four and a half feet and two are five feet broad each differ ing little probably from the original thickniess of the living trunks All these may be verified by consulting our diagram wlhich was drawn to a scale fromn the actual admea surements of the stems at the time of discovery The exterior or epidermal and the cortical coverinig are in these specimens converted into coal This carbonizing process during the imperfect crystallization of the coal tends greatly to ambiguity for by this circumstance we are deprived of the only certain mode to which we can resort for determining slecies The obscurity occasioned by this modification of surface has added to our embarrassments in examnining these fossils and has occasioned no slight hesitation in establishling their specific identity Where the thickness of bark is considerable as in Sigillaria pachydermnata of Brongniart and the Lepidodendron rimosuqm of Sternberc the characteristic marking of the cicatrices when converted to coal is nearly obliterated In the case of the species before alluded to Sigillaria elegans thle carbonized bark appears to be only one twentyfifth part of an inch thick and when removed shows that the inferior surface still bears a modified resem blance to the outer covering It seems highly probable that a large proportion of the bulki of the coal itself was lerived from the stems and leaves of Sigillaria for by the appearances which yet remain they must have stood as thickly crowded as any of our most densely wooded forests M Brongniart has stated that the great number of leaves which the Sigillaires bore extending along their entire length and which had evidently been disarticulated and had fallen before the stem was buried in the strata announce a life of no ordinary luration and a growth which has required a considerable lapse of time Notwithstand ing this we observe that the inferior extremity of the trunk presents flutings and cica trices which agree as to size with those near the top of the same stems and which are nearly as strongly marked The trunk has undergone then no considerable change or increase in its diameter nor any remarkable alteration in the state of its surface towsards224 FOSSIL COAL PLANTS tlhe base These views confirm the remarli which has been here already made respect ing the singular maintenance in size of the diameter of the Sigillaires of our own coal fields Respecting tlle class of plants to which these enormous trunks appertained we have good authority for placina them among the nujmerous families of the group of ferns It is impossible M Brongniart contends to admit that these stems had belonged to vegetables of the class of dicotyledons No wood of dicotyledonous or monocotyledonous plants properly speaking have been found in the coal fields nor is there any dicotyle donous plant actually existing which shows stems regularly grooved and bearing the organs which after their fall leave cicatrices at all analogous to those of the Sigillaires The ancient surface therefore during the growth of our Pennsylvania coal strata was overshadowed by groves of gigantic ferns rivalling in magnitude the trees of our present forests THE NORTH WALL OR ROOF We turn now to the examination of the north wall or rock roof of our coal seam Here an entirely different aspect presents itself well worth the recital Instead of an interlaced mass composed of innumerable thinly comipressed and flattened stems dis played upon a comparatively smootlh surface of black clay shale we have a series of long bifurcating columns whose dark forms are relieved against the lighiter coloured concrlo merate We are struck with the fact that unlilie tlhose on the opposite wall excepting in one species none of these stems are straight they all possess remarkable cur7atures Their bark originally very thin and since converted into coaly laminw readily falls away under the operations of the miner Much was probably destroyed at a vastlv older period amidst the turbuleince which attended their prostration Of tllis we have some evidence in the occasional marks of rubbing which some of these stems appear to have received Both circumstances contribute to the difficulty of identifying the species All these trees appear to belong not only to one genus but to a single species Less numerousinasmuch as they indicate such only as lived at that remarkable epoch when the diluvial waters heaving along enormous rnasses of sand and gravel and pebbles swept over the surfaceless numerous I say than that earlier vegetation which slowlv and quietly accumulated at the base of the coal in the position we have Just been consi dering themthese prostrated overlying trunks present even a more interesting specta cle Seldom has it occurred to witness an exhibition of antediluvian vegetation like tllis of which we have given but an imperfect sketch Facilitated by the gradual advance of the work under his immediate direction the writer had abundant leisure for observinig these remains and opportunities were not lost to prepare a faithful picture of the most interesting Ample as apparenitly were thle  The clay floor of the coal bearing these magnificent traces of tropical vegetation exhibits when broken in its interior the grasslike leaves of Lycopodiolite and Stigmaria One of the family of Sigillaria also S Lepidendri folia bears leaves which are not greatly dissimilar to those of the former Leaves of the other and smaller ferns are not very frequent here Stigmaria is less abundant than usual in other seams and has contributed but little towards the composition of the mass Qf coalFOSSIL COAL PLANTS 225 means of observation afforded by the excavations yet such is the magnitude of each individtual specimen that we have againi to regret the want of additional space to enable the examination to be followed up satisfactorily Fortunately in one or twvo instances we are enabled to approximate to the probable length of the stems although in neither case arc we sure of the exact character of their terminations Believing that the absence of more complete data is an insufficient reason for withholdingf so much as we really do know I have not scrupled to prepare this memoir One of the instances adverted to a dichotomous specimen has a remarkable flexuous stem It would be hazarding too rmiuch to guess at its probable length for both extre mities are concealed Not less than sixtyfive feet however in extent is clearly visible For aught that can be inferred from its present appearance this tree rnay have extended thirty or forty feet still longer The other specimen the most interestingf in fact of the group shows its lower extremnity near what mighlt have been the root For the first forty feet there is but little diminution or tapering perhaps about six inches so that our admeasurements give in that distance an average thickness of two feet Lilie the others with whiclh it is associated this trunk is flexuous but is least so towards its superior part for the last forty feet Seventy feet of this fine stem are exposed within the limits of our drawingwe followedl it several feet in the coal shale below the level surface without discovering any sign of termnination The specimens exhibited on the societys table were taken from that concealed portion We may venture to assign a height of tllis tree of from eighty to one hundred feet During the greatest portion of its entire length a central longitudinal groove or depression appears somewhat after the manner of some Stigmarias and Lepidodendrons Like the other cases previously alluded to such portions of the carbonized bark as remiained on the trunk or mould were extremely thin readily scaling off when dry This bark was not mnore than from A to L of an incll in thickness No traces of any other or second bark externally has been observed inl any specimen A third trunk appears near the entrance to tlle gallery this specimen exhibits more than fifty feet now uncovered by coal or slate we might judge from its appearance that it extended thirty or forty feet farther It is necessary to mention that none of these trunks were in the extremely compressed state suclh as is exhibited in those on the bottom slate They occur as casts filled with indurated clay When fractured they break in rhomboids whose acute angle is forty three degrees Longitudinal flutings are visible throughout the length of these stems and obscure marks of cicatrices of the smallest class are of general occurrence There now remains only the important inquiry under what class and family shlould these magnificent trunks be arranged In the midst of certain obvious difficulties we have not scrupled to class these dichotomous stems with the Sigillaires and in that divi sion which is now admitted among the tree ferns We have even ventured to refer them to Sigillaires elegans or hexagona With respect to the Sigillarie which have bifurca tions M Brongniart admits that they are confined to a single species which species is the Sigillaria elegans In this he is corroborated by M Graeser director of mines who asserts that this character is frequent in that species With regard to the general form of thle trunks of Sigillaria their height and their mode of termination there is still very inicornplete data We have rarely had occasion VOL IX6O226 FOSSIL COAL PLANTS to follow these stems to a great extent However int the mine of Kunzwerk M Brong niart was able to measure one stem of Sigillaria which laid parallel to the gallery of extraction which stem was more than forty feet long This stem diminished insensi bly from the base where it was one foot tlhick to near the summit where it was only six inches and there divided into two equal branches I am not aware that anly fossil trees from the coal measures have ever been described which at all approached to the dimensions of our Pennsylvania Sioillaria Respecting the admission of the Sigillaires into the family of the ferns we have seen that Messrs Lindley and Hutton entertain sornewhat different views from M Brongniart WYe have stated with great brevity the reasons which induce the last named naturalist to adhere to his classification at the sarme tirme to include therein one section under the name of Caulopteris containing four species of unrdoubted arborescent ferns and they are strikingly analogous to those which still actually exist Of these four fossil arborescent ferns one species the Sigillaire Cistii exists in the Coal Strata of Wilkesbarre in this State Fiftyfive species of Sigillaria besidles thie four of Caulopteris occupy the coal forrnation Many of these perhaps all are comrnon both to Europe and to Arnerica That investigation has still to be followed uJ On one point all are agreedthat all the fossil plants of whatever class attained a miagnitude vastly more considerable than the largest existing analogous species From the rocky covering of this and one or two adjacent coal seams I have obtained specirnens of Lycopodiurm elegans one or two uncertain casts of Sigillaria Knorria im bricata Stigmaria fcoides Lepidodendron two species besides carbonized leaves and impressions of Lyeoqpodiolites in the grits and sandstones Calamnites are rare in this vicin ity The discovery not long ago announced by lr Logan that the plant Stigmaria cha racterized and almost universally prevailed in the under clay of argillaceous floors of the coal searyms of Europe seems to hold good on this continent On examination any one can perceive that our lower shales on which coal beds rest are crowded with the stems and leaves of this sinogular plant It was however further maintained that the floors alone and not the roofs contain the vestiges of these vegretables I have not had much subsequernt opportunity of satisfying myself on the latter point since its announcement but I think it is extremely probable and that in a great measure the phenomena here agree with those developed by the European naturalist The drawing which accompanies this aper and all the notes respecting the fossil plants which were exhibited on seven or eight thousand square feet having been com pleted prior to that announcement I was desirous to see how far they were in conformity with Mr Logans system On examining this drawing we shall perceive that only two specimens of Stigmaria occur in the entire length of the gallery One of them is above the coal on the north wall the other is below the coal on the south wall This is certainly not a very satis factory corroboration but the plant overlying the coal may be a solitary individual con nected originally with the thin slaty covering of the coal as however it appears by the sketch to have some of its leaves in close proximity if not in direct contact with the stem it has evidently not been removed from a dIstance into the position in which weFOSSIL COAL PLANTS 227 observe it It probably had been rooted in the thin slate seam between the coal and the rock A siliceous cast of a second stigmaria apparently of another species was obtained from the sandstone above As similar sandstone casts of Stigmaria are among the com monest fossils found among the superficial debris of this carboniferous region it can scarcely be maintained with strict propriety that these plants are limited to the soft argillaceous beds upon which the coal seams repose Time and extended observation will determine the value of the rule It will then perhaps be found that every bed of clay embraced within the true limits of coal fields contains a greater or less amount of these exuvi8a such clay being the natural position in which they grew and were sus tained The following are the principal fossil plants referred to in the

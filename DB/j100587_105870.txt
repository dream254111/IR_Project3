TO MATHEW MATY M D SEC R S S I R NAPLES OCT 17 1769 ENCOURAGED BY THE ASSURANCES YOU GIVE ME IN YOUR LAST OBLIGING LETTER OF THE 15TH OF JUNE THAT ANY NEW COMMU NICATION UPON THE SUBJECT OF VOLCANOS WOULD BE RECEIVED WITH SATISFACTION BY THE ROYAL SOCIETY I VENTURE TO SEND YOU THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNT OF MY LATE OBSERVATIONS UPON MOUNT ETNA WHICH YOU ARE AT LIBERTY TO LAY BEFORE OUR RESPECTABLE SOCIETY SHOULD YOU THINK IT WORTH ITS NOTICE VOL LX B AFTER READ JAN 18 17702 AFTER HAVING EXAMINED WITH MUCH ATTENTION THE OPERATIONS OF MOUNT VESUVIUS DURING THE FIVE YEARS THAT I HAVE HAD THE HONOUR OF RESIDING AS HIS MA JESTYS MINISTER AT THIS COURT AND AFTER HAVING CARE FULLY REMARKED THE NATURE OF THE SOIL FOR FIFTEEN MILES ROUND THIS CAPITAL I AM IN MY OWN MIND WELL CON VINCED THAT THE WHOLE OF IT HAS BEEN FORMED BY EXPLOSION MANY OF THE CRATERS FROM WHENCE THIS MATTER HAS ISSUED ARE STILL VISIBLE SUCH AS THE SALFATERRA NEAR PUZZOLE THE LAKE OF AGNANO AND NEAR THIS LAKE A MOUNTAIN COMPOSED OF BURNT MATTER THAT HAS A VERY LARGE CRATER SURROUNDED WITH A WALL TO INCLOSE THE WILD BOARS AND DEER THAT ARE KEPT THERE FOR THE DIVERSION OF HIS SICILIAN MAJESTY IT IS CALLED ASTRUNI THE MONTE NUOVO THROWN UP FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE LUCRINE LAKE IN THE YEAR 1538 WHICH HAS LIKEWISE ITS CRATER AND THE LAKE OF AVERNO THE ISLANDS OF NISIDA AND PROCIDA ARE ENTIRELY COM POSED OF BURNT MATTER THE ISLAND OF ISCHIA IS LIKE WISE COMPOSED OF LAVA PUMICE AND BURNT MATTER AND THERE ARE IN THAT ISLAND SEVERAL VISIBLE CRATERS FROM ONE OF WHICH NO LONGER AGO THAN THE YEAR 1303 THERE ISSUED A LAVA WHICH RAN INTO THE SEA AND IS STILL IN THE SAME BARREN STATE AS THE MODERN LAVAS OF VE SUVIUS AFTER HAVING I SAY BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO THESE OBSERVATIONS I WAS WELL PREPARED TO VISIT THE MOST ANCIENT AND PERHAPS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE VOLCANO THAT EXISTS AND I HAD THE SATISFACTION OF BEING THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THERE OF THE FORMATION OF VERY CONSIDERABLE MOUNTAINS BY MEER EXPLOSION HAVING SEEN MANY SUCH ON THE SIDES OF ETNA AS WILL BE RELATED HEREAFTER ON3 ON THE 24TH OF JUNE LAST IN THE AFTERNOON I LEFT CATANIA A TOWN SITUATED AT THE FOOT OF MOUNT ETNA OR AS IT IS NOW CALLED MON GIBELLO IN COMPANY WITH LORD FORTROSE AND THE CANONICO RECUPERO AN INGE NIOUS PRIEST OF CATANIA WHO IS THE ONLY PERSON THERE THAT IS ACQUAINTED WITH THE MOUNTAIN HE IS ACTUALLY EMPLOYED IN WRITING ITS NATURAL HISTORY BUT I FEAR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO COMPASS SO GREAT AND USEFUL AN UNDERTAKING FOR WANT OF PROPER ENCOURAGEMENT WE PASSED THROUGH THE INFERIOR DISTRICT OF THE MOUNTAIN CALLED BY ITS INHABITANTS LA REGIONE PIE MONTESE IT IS WELL WATERED EXCEEDINGLY FERTILE AND ABOUNDING WITH VINES AND OTHER FRUIT TREES WHERE THE LAVA OR AS IT IS CALLED THERE THE SCIARA HAS HAD TIME TO SOFTEN AND GATHER SOIL SUFFICIENT FOR VEGETATION WHICH I AM CONVINCED FROM MANY OBSERVATIONS UNLESS ASSISTED BY ART DOES NOT COME TO PASS FOR MANY AGES PERHAPS A THOUSAND YEARS OR MORE THE CIRCUIT OF THIS LOWER REGION FORMING THE BASIS OF THE GREAT VOLCANO IS UPWARDS OF ONE HUNDRED ITALIAN MILES THE VINES OF ETNA ARE KEPT LOW QUITE THE REVERSE OF THOSE ON THE BORDERS OF VESUVIUS AND THEY PRODUCE A STRONGER WINE BUT NOT IN SO GREAT ABUNDANCE THE PIEMONTESE DISTRICT IS COVERED WITH TOWNS VILLAGES MONASTERIES C AND IS WELL PEOPLED NOTWITHSTAND ING THE DANGER OF SUCH A SITUATION CATANIA SO OFTEN DESTROYED BY ERUPTIONS OF ETNA AND TOTALLY OVER THROWN BY AN EARTHQUAKE TOWARDS THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY HAS BEEN REBUILT WITHIN THESE FIFTY YEARS AND IS NOW A CONSIDERABLE TOWN WITH AT LEAST THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND INHABITANTS I DO NOT WONDER AT THE SEEMING SECURITY WITH WHICH THESE PARTS ARE INHABITED HAVING BEEN SO LONG WITNESS TO THE SAME NEAR MOUNT B 2 VESUVIUS4 VESUVIUS THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE ARE SLOW GREAT ERUPTIONS DO NOT FREQUENTLY HAPPEN EACH FLATTERS HIMSELF IT WILL NOT HAPPEN IN HIS TIME OR IF IT SHOULD THAT HIS TUTELAR SAINT WILL TURN AWAY THE DESTRUCTIVE LAVA FROM HIS GROUNDS THEN INDEED THE GREAT FER TILITY IN THE NEIGHBOURHOODS OF VOLCANOS TEMPTS PEOPLE TO INHABIT THEM IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF GRADUAL ASCENT WE ARRIVED AT A LITTLE CONVENT OF BENEDICTINE MONKS CALLED ST NICOLO DELL ARENA ABOUT THIRTEEN MILES FROM CA TANIA AND WITHIN A MILE OF THE VOLCANO FROM WHENCE ISSUED THE LAST VERY GREAT ERUPTION IN THE YEAR 1669 A CIRCUMSTANTIAL ACCOUNT OF WHICH WAS SENT TO OUR COURT BY A LORD WINCHELSEA WHO HAPPENED TO BE THEN AT CATANIA IN HIS WAY HOME FROM HIS EMBASSY AT CONSTANTINOPLE HIS LORDSHIPS ACCOUNT IS CURIOUS AND WAS PRINTED IN LONDON SOON AFTER I SAW A COPY OF IT AT PALERMO IN THE LIBRARY OF THE PRINCE TORRE MUZZO  WE SLEPT IN THE BENEDICTINES CONVENT  IT IS INTITULED A TRUE AND EXACT RELATION OF THE LATE PRODI GIOUS EARTHQUAKE AND ERUPTION OF MOUNT AETNA OR MONTE GIBELLO AS IT CAME IN A LETTER WRITTEN TO HIS MAJESTY FROM NAPLES BY THE RIGHT HONOURABLE THE EARL OF WINCHELSEA HIS MAJESTYS LATE AMBASSADOR AT CONSTANTINOPLE WHO IN HIS RETURN FROM THENCE VISITING CATANIA IN THE ISLAND OF SICILY WAS AN EYE WITNESS OF THAT DREADFUL SPECTACLE TOGETHER WITH A MORE PAR TICULAR NARRATIVE OF THE SAME AS IT IS COLLECTED OUT OF THE SEVERAL RELATIONS SENT FROM CATANIA PUBLISHED BY AUTHORITY PRINTED BY T NEWCOMB IN THE SAVOY 1669 P 38  I ACCEPTED SAYS THE AUTHOR THE INVITATION OF THE BISHOP OF  CATANIA TO STAY A DAY WITH HIM THAT SO I MIGHT BE THE BETTER  ABLE TO INFORM YOUR MAJESTY OF THAT EXTRAORDINARY FIRE WHICH  COMES FROM MOUNT GIBEL 15 MILES DISTANT FROM THAT CITY  WHICH FOR ITS HORRIDNESS IN THE ASPECT FOR THE VAST QUANTITY  THEREOF FOR IT IS 15 MILES IN LENGTH AND 7 IN BREADTH FOR ITS THE5 THE NIGHT OF THE 24TH AND PASSED THE NEXT MORNING IN OBSERVING THE RAVAGE MADE BY THE ABOVEMENTIONED TERRIBLE ERUPTION OVER THE RICH COUNTRY OF THE PIE MONTESE THE LAVA BURST OUT OF A VINEYARD WITHIN  MONSTROUS DEVASTATION AND QUICK PROGRESS MAY BE TERMED AN  INUNDATION OF FIRE A FLOOD OF FIRE CINDERS AND BURNING STONES  BURNING WITH THAT RAGE AS TO ADVANCE INTO THE SEA 600 YARDS  AND THAT TO A MILE IN BREADTH WHICH I SAW AND THAT WHICH  DID AUGMENT MY ADMIRATION WAS TO SEE IN THE SEA THIS MATTER  LIKE RAGGED ROCKS BURNING IN FOUR FATHOM WATER TWO FATHOM  HIGHER THAN THE SEA ITSELF SOME PARTS LIQUID AND THROWING OFF  NOT WITH GREAT VIOLENCE THE STONES ABOUT IT WHICH LIKE A CRUST  OF A VAST BIGNESS AND RED HOT FELL INTO THE SEA EVERY MOMENT  IN SOME PLACE OR OTHER CAUSING A GREAT AND HORRIBLE NOISE  SMOAK AND HISSING IN THE SEA AND THAT MORE AND MORE COMING  AFTER IT MAKING A FIRM FOUNDATION IN THE SEA ITSELF I STAYED  THERE FROM 9 A CLOCK ON SATURDAY MORNING TO SEVEN NEXT  MORNING THIS MUST HAVE BEEN TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OR LATTER END OF APRIL  AND THIS MOUNTAIN OF FIRE AND STONES WITH  CINDERS HAD ADVANCED INTO THE SEA 20 YARDS AT LEAST IN SEVERAL  PLACES IN THE MIDDLE OF THIS FIRE WHICH BURNT IN THE SEA  IT HATH FORMED LIKE TO A RIVER WITH ITS BANKS ON EACH SIDE VERY  STEEP AND CRAGGY AND IN THIS CHANNEL MOVES THE GREATEST  QUANTITY OF THIS FIRE WHICH IS THE MOST LIQUID WITH STONES  OF THE SAME COMPOSITION AND CINDERS ALL RED HOT SWIMMING  UPON THE FIRE OF A GREAT MAGNITUDE FROM THIS RIVER OF FIRE  DOTH PROCEED UNDER THE GREAT MASSE OF THE STONES WHICH ARE  GENERALLY THREE FATHOMS HIGH ALL OVER THE COUNTRY WHERE IT  BURNS AND IN OTHER PLACES MUCH MORE THERE ARE SECRET CON  DUITS OR RIVULETS OF THIS LIQUID MATTER WHICH COMMUNICATES  FIRE AND HEAT INTO ALL PARTS MORE OR LESS AND MELTS THE STONES  AND CINDERS BY FITS IN THOSE PLACES WHERE IT TOUCHETH THEM  OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHERE IT MEETS WITH ROCKS OR HOUSES  OF THE SAME MATTER AS MANY ARE THEY MELT AND GO AWAY  WITH THE FIRE WHERE THEY FIND OTHER COMPOSITIONS THEY TURN  THEM TO LIME OR ASHES AS I AM INFORMED THE COMPOSITION  OF THIS FIRE STONES AND CINDERS ARE SULPHUR NITRE QUICK  SILVER SAL AMMONIAC LEAD IRON BRASS AND ALL OTHER METALS  IT MOVES NOT REGULARLY NOR CONSTANTLY DOWN HILL IN A MILE6 A MILE OF ST NICOLO AND BY FREQUENT EXPLOSIONS OF STONES AND ASHES RAISED THERE A MOUNTAIN WHICH AS NEAR AS I CAN JUDGE HAVING ASCENDED IT IS NOT LESS THAN HALF A MILE PERPENDICULAR IN HEIGHT AND IS CERTAINLY AT LEAST THREE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE AT ITS  SOME PLACES IT HATH MADE THE VALLEYS HILLS AND THE HILLS  THAT ARE NOT HIGH ARE NOW VALLEYS WHEN IT WAS NIGHT I  WENT UPON TWO TOWERS IN DIVERS PLACES AND COULD PLAINLY SEE  AT TEN MILES DISTANCE AS WE JUDGED THE FIRE TO BEGIN TO RUN  FROM THE MOUNTAIN IN A DIRECT LINE THE FLAME TO ASCEND AS  HIGH AND AS BIG AS ONE OF THE GREATEST STEEPLES IN YOUR MA  JESTYS KINGDOMS AND TO THROW UP GREAT STONES INTO THE AIR I  COULD DISCERN THE RIVER OF FIRE TO DESCEND THE MOUNTAIN OF A  TERRIBLE FIERY OR RED COLOUR AND STONES OF A PALER RED TO SWIM  THEREON AND TO BE SOME AS BIG AS AN ORDINARY TABLE WE COULD  SEE THIS FIRE TO MOVE IN SEVERAL OTHER PLACES AND ALL THE COUN  TRY COVERED WITH FIRE ASCENDING WITH GREAT FLAMES IN MANY  PLACES SMOAKING LIKE TO A VIOLENT FURNACE OF IRON MELTED  MAKING A NOISE WITH THE GREAT PIECES THAT FELL ESPECIALLY THOSE  WHICH FELL INTO THE SEA A CAVALIER OF MALTA WHO LIVES THERE  AND ATTENDED ME TOLD ME THAT THE RIVER WAS AS LIQUID WHERE  IT ISSUES OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN AS WATER AND CAME OUT LIKE A  TORRENT WITH GREAT VIOLENCE AND IS FIVE OR SIX FATHOM DEEP  AND AS BROAD AND THAT NO STONES SINK THEREIN I ASSURE YOUR  MAJESTY NO PEN CAN EXPRESS HOW TERRIBLE IT IS NOR CAN ALL  THE ART AND INDUSTRY OF THE WORLD QUENCH OR DIVERT THAT WHICH  IS BURNING IN THE COUNTRY IN 40 DAYS TIME IT HATH DESTROYED  THE HABITATIONS OF 27000 PERSONS MADE TWO HILLS OF ONE  1000 PACES HIGH APIECE AND ONE IS FOUR MILES IN COMPASS  OF 20000 PERSONS WHICH INHABIT CATANIA 3000 DID ONLY RE  MAIN ALL THEIR GOODS ARE CARRIED AWAY THE CANNONS OF BRASS  ARE REMOVED OUT OF THE CASTLE SOME GREAT BELLS TAKEN DOWN  THE CITYGATES WALLED UP NEXT THE FIRE AND PREPARATIONS MADE  TO ABANDON THE CITY  THAT NIGHT WHICH I LAY THERE IT RAINED ASHES ALL OVER THE  CITY AND TEN MILES AT SEA IT TROUBLED MY EYES THIS FIRE IN  ITS PROGRESS MET WITH A LAKE OF FOUR MILES IN COMPASS AND IT  WAS NOT ONLY SATISFIED TO FILL IT UP THOUGH IT WAS FOUR FATHOM  DEEP BUT HATH MADE OF IT A MOUNTAIN BASIS7 BASIS THE LAVA THAT RAN FROM IT AND ON WHICH THERE ARE AS YET NO SIGNS OF VEGETATION IS FOURTEEN MILES IN LENGTH AND IN MANY PARTS SIX IN BREADTH IT REACHED CATANIA AND DESTROYED PART OF ITS WALLS BURIED AN AMPHITHEATRE AN AQUEDUCT AND MANY OTHER MONUMENTS OF ITS ANCIENT GRANDEUR WHICH TILL THEN HAD RESISTED THE HAND OF TIME AND RAN A CONSIDERABLE LENGTH INTO THE SEA SO AS TO HAVE ONCE FORMED A BEAUTIFUL AND SAFE HARBOUR BUT IT WAS SOON AFTER FILLED UP BY A FRESH TORRENT OF THE SAME INFLAMED MATTER A CIRCUMSTANCE THE CATANIANS LAMENT TO THIS DAY AS THEY ARE WITHOUT A PORT THERE HAS BEEN NO FUCH ERUPTION SINCE THOUGH THERE ARE SIGNS OF MANY MORE TERRIBLE THAT HAVE PRECEDED IT FOR TWO OR THREE MILES ROUND THE MOUNTAIN RAISED BY THIS ERUPTION ALL IS BARREN AND COVERED WITH ASHES THIS GROUND AS WELL AS THE MOUNTAIN ITSELF WILL IN TIME CERTAINLY BE AS FERTILE AS MANY OTHER MOUNTAINS IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD THAT HAVE BEEN LIKE WISE FORMED BY EXPLOSION IF THE DATES OF THESE EX PLOSIONS COULD BE ASCERTAINED IT WOULD BE VERY CU RIOUS AND MARK THE PROGRESS OF TIME WITH RESPECT TO THE RETURN OF VEGETATION AS THE MOUNTAINS RAISED BY THEM ARE IN DIFFERENT STATES THOSE WHICH I IMAGINE TO BE THE MOST MODERN ARE COVERED WITH ASHES ONLY OTHERS OF AN OLDER DATE WITH SMALL PLANTS AND HERBS AND THE MOST ANTIENT WITH THE LARGEST TIMBER TREES I EVER SAW BUT I BELIEVE THE LATTER ARE SO VERY ANCIENT AS TO BE FAR OUT OF THE REACH OF HISTORY AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN RAISED BY THE ERUPTION OF THE YEAR 1669 THERE IS A HOLE THROUGH WHICH BY MEANS OF A ROPE WE DESCENDED INTO SEVERAL SUBTERRANEOUS CAVERNS BRANCHING OUT AND EXTENDING MUCH FARTHER AND8 AND DEEPER THAN WE CHOSE TO VENTURE THE COLD THERE BEING EXCESSIVE AND A VIOLENT WIND FREQUENTLY EX TINGUISHING SOME OF OUR TORCHES THESE CAVERNS UNDOUBTEDLY CONTAINED THE LAVA THAT ISSUED FORTH AND EXTENDED AS I SAID BEFORE QUITE TO CATANIA THERE ARE MANY OF THESE SUBTERRANEOUS CAVITIES KNOWN ON OTHER PARTS OF ETNA SUCH AS THAT CALLED BY THE PEASANTS LA BARACCA VECCHIA ANOTHER LA SPELONCA DELLA PA LOMBA FROM THE WILD PIDGEONS BUILDING THEIR NESTS THEREIN AND THE CAVERN THALIA MENTIONED BY BOC CACCIO SOME OF THEM ARE MADE USE OF AS MAGAZINES FOR SNOW THE WHOLE ISLAND OF SICILY AND MALTA BE ING SUPPLIED WITH THIS ESSENTIAL ARTICLE IN A HOT CLIMATE FROM MOUNT ETNA MANY MORE WOULD BE FOUND I DARE SAY IF SEARCHED FOR PARTICULARLY NEAR AND UNDER THE CRATERS FROM WHENCE GREAT LAVAS HAVE ISLUED AS THE IMMENSE QUANTITIES OF SUCH MATTER WE SEE ABOVE GROUND MUST NECESSARILY SUPPOSE VERY GREAT HOLLOWS UNDERNEATH AFTER HAVING PASSED THE MORNING OF THE 25TH IN THESE OBSERVATIONS WE PROCEEDED THROUGH THE SECOND OR MIDDLE REGION OF ETNA CALLED LA SELVOSA THE WOODY THAN WHICH NOTHING CAN BE MORE BEAUTI FUL ON EVERY SIDE ARE MOUNTAINS OR FRAGMENTS OF MOUNTAINS THAT HAVE BEEN THROWN UP BY VARIOUS ANCIENT EXPLOSIONS THERE ARE SOME NEAR AS HIGH AS MOUNT VESUVIUS ONE IN PARTICULAR AS THE CANON OUR GUIDE ASSURED ME HAVING MEASURED IT IS LITTLE LESS THAN ONE MILE IN PERPENDICULAR HEIGHTH AND FIVE IN CIRCUMFERENCE AT ITS BASIS THEY ARE ALL MORE OR LESS COVERED EVEN WITHIN THEIR CRATERS AS WELL AS THE RICH VALLEYS BETWEEN THEM WITH THE LARGEST OAK CHESNUT AND FIRR TREES I EVERY SAW ANY WHERE AND INDEED IT9 IT IS FROM HENCE CHIEFLY THAT HIS SICILIAN MAJESTYS DOCKYARDS ARE SUPPLIED WITH TIMBER AS THIS PART OF ETNA WAS FAMOUS FOR ITS TIMBER IN THE TIME OF THE TYRANTS OF SYRACUSA AND AS IT REQUIRES THE GREAT LENGTH OF TIME I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED BEFORE THE MATTER IS FIT FOR VEGETATION WE MAY CONCEIVE THE GREAT AGE OF THIS RESPECTABLE VOLCANO THE CHESNUTTREES PREDOMINATED IN THE PARTS THROUGH WHICH WE PASSED AND THOUGH OF A VERY GREAT SIZE ARE NOT TO BE COMPARED TO SOME ON ANOTHER PART OF THE REGIONE SELVOSA CALLED CARPINETTO I HAVE BEEN TOLD BY MANY AND PARTICULARLY BY OUR GUIDE WHO HAD MEASURED THE LARGEST THERE CALLED LA CASTAGNA DI CENTO CAVALLI THAT IT IS UPWARDS OF TWENTYEIGHT NEAPOLITAN CANES IN CIRCUMFERENCE NOW AS A NEA POLITAN CANE IS TWO YARDS AND HALF A QUARTER ENGLISH MEASURE YOU MAY JUDGE SIR OF THE IMMENSE SIZE OF THIS FAMOUS TREE IT IS HOLLOW FROM AGE BUT THERE IS ANOTHER NEAR IT ALMOST AS LARGE AND SOUND AS IT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED A JOURNEY OF TWO DAYS TO HAVE VISITED THIS EXTRAORDINARY TREE AND THE WEATHER BE ING ALREADY VERY HOT I DID NOT SEE IT IT IS AMAZING TO ME THAT TREES SHOULD FLOURISH IN SO SHALLOW A SOIL FOR THEY CANNOT PENETRATE DEEP WITHOUT MEETING WITH A ROCK OF LAVA AND INDEED GREAT PART OF THE ROOTS OF THE LARGE TREES WE PASSED BY ARE ABOVE GROUND AND HAVE ACQUIRED BY THE IMPRESSION OF THE AIR A BARK LIKE THAT OF THEIR BRANCHES IN THIS PART OF THE MOUNTAIN ARE THE FINEST HORNED CATTLE IN SICILY WE REMARKED IN GENERAL THAT THE HORNS OF THE SICILIAN CATTLE ARE NEAR TWICE THE SIZE OF ANY WE HAD EVER SEEN THE CATTLE THEMSELVES ARE OF THE COMMON SIZE WE PASSED BY THE LAVA OF THE LAST ERUPTION IN THE YEAR VOL LX C 176610 1766 WHICH HAS DESTROYED ABOVE FOUR MILES SQUARE OF THE BEAUTIFUL WOOD ABOVEMENTIONED THE MOUN TAIN RAISED BY THIS ERUPTION ABOUNDS WITH SULPHUR AND SALTS EXACTLY RESEMBLING THOSE OF VESUVIUS SPECIMENS OF WHICH I SENT SOME TIME AGO TO THE LATE LORD MORTON IN ABOUT FIVE HOURS FROM THE TIME WE HAD LEFT THE CONVENT OF ST NICOLO DELL ARENA WE ARRIVED AT THE BORDERS OF THE THIRD REGION CALLED LA NETTA OR SCO PERTA CLEAN OR UNCOVERED WHERE WE FOUND A VERY SHARP AIR INDEED SO THAT IN THE SAME DAY THE FOUR SEASONS OF THE YEAR WERE SENSIBLY FELT BY US ON THIS MOUNTAIN EXCESSIVE SUMMER HEATS IN THE PIEMONTESE SPRING AND AUTUMN TEMPERATURE IN THE MIDDLE AND EXTREME COLD OF WINTER IN THE UPPER REGION I COULD PERCEIVE AS WE APPROACHED THE LATTER A GRADUAL DECREASE OF VEGETATION AND FROM LARGE TIMBER TREES WE CAME TO THE SMALLER SHRUBS AND PLANTS OF THE NORTHERN CLIMATES I OBSERVED QUANTITIES OF JUNIPER AND TANZEY OUR GUIDE TOLD US THAT LATER IN THE SEASON THERE ARE NUMBERLESS CURIOUS PLANTS HERE AND THAT IN SOME PARTS THERE ARE RHUBARB AND SAFFRON IN PLENTY IN CARRERAS HISTORY OF CATANIA THERE IS A LIST OF ALL THE PLANTS AND HERBS OF ETNA IN ALPHABETICAL ORDER NIGHT COMING ON WE HERE PITCHED A TENT AND MADE A GOOD FIRE WHICH WAS VERY NECESSARY FOR WITHOUT IT AND VERY WARM CLOATHING WE SHOULD SURELY HAVE PERISHED WITH COLD AND AT ONE OF THE CLOCK IN THE MORNING OF THE 26TH WE PURSUED OUR JOURNEY TOWARDS THE GREAT CRATER WE PASSED OVER VALLEYS OF SNOW THAT NEVER MELTS EXCEPT THERE IS AN ERUPTION OF LAVA FROM THE UPPER CRATER WHICH SCARCELY EVER HAPPENS THE GREAT ERUPTIONS ARE USUALLY FROM11 FROM THE MIDDLE REGION THE INFLAMED MATTER FINDING AS I SUPPOSE ITS PASSAGE THROUGH SOME WEAK PART LONG BEFORE IT CAN RISE TO THE EXCESSIVE HEIGHT OF THE UPPER REGION THE GREAT MOUTH ON THE SUMMIT ONLY SERVING AS A COMMON CHIMNEY TO THE VOLCANO IN MANY PLACES THE SNOW IS COVERED WITH A BED OF ASHES THROWN OUT OF THE CRATER AND THE SUN MELTING IT IN SOME PARTS MAKES THIS GROUND TREACHEROUS BUT AS WE HAD WITH US BESIDES OUR GUIDE A PEASANT WELL ACCUSTOMED TO THESE VALLEYS WE ARRIVED SAFE AT THE FOOT OF THE LITTLE MOUNTAIN OF ASHES THAT CROWNS ETNA ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE RISING OF THE SUN THIS MOUNTAIN IS SITUATED IN A GENTLY INCLINING PLAIN OF ABOUT NINE MILES IN CIRCUMFERENCE IT IS ABOUT A QUARTER OF A MILE PERPENDICULAR IN HEIGHT VERY STEEP BUT NOT QUITE SO STEEP AS VESUVIUS IT HAS BEEN THROWN UP WITHIN THESE TWENTYFIVE OR THIRTY YEARS AS MANY PEOPLE AT CATANIA HAVE TOLD ME THEY RE MEMBERED WHEN THERE WAS ONLY A LARGE CHASM OR CRATER IN THE MIDST OF THE ABOVEMENTIONED PLAIN TILL NOW THE ASCENT HAD BEEN SO GRADUAL FOR THE TOP OF ETNA IS NOT LESS THAN THIRTY MILES FROM CATANIA FROM WHENCE THE ASCENT BEGINS AS NOT TO HAVE BEEN THE LEAST FATIGUING AND IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR THE SNOW WE MIGHT HAVE RODE UPON OUR MULES TO THE VERY FOOT OF THE LITTLE MOUNTAIN HIGHER THAN WHICH THE CANON OUR GUIDE HAD NEVER BEEN BUT AS I SAW THAT THIS LITTLE MOUNTAIN WAS COMPOSED IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE TOP OF VESUVIUS WHICH NOTWITHSTAND ING THE SMOAK ISSUING FROM EVERY PORE IS SOLID AND FIRM I MADE NO SCRUPLE OF GOING UP TO THE EDGE OF THE CRATER AND MY COMPANIONS FOLLOWED THE STEEP ASCENT THE KEENNESS OF THE AIR THE VAPOURS OF THE C 2 SULPHUR12 SULPHUR AND THE VIOLENCE OF THE WIND WHICH OBLIGED US SEVERAL TIMES TO THROW OURSELVES FLAT UPON OUR FACES TO AVOID BEING OVERTURNED BY IT MADE THIS LATTER PART OF OUR EXPEDITION RATHER INCONVENIENT AND DIS AGREEABLE OUR GUIDE BY WAY OF COMFORT ASSURED US THAT THERE WAS GENERALLY MUCH MORE WIND IN THE UPPER REGION AT THIS TIME SOON AFTER WE HAD SEATED OURSELVES ON THE HIGHEST POINT OF ETNA THE SUN AROSE AND DISPLAYED A SCENE THAT INDEED PASSES ALL DESCRIPTION THE HORIZON LIGHTING UP BY DEGREES WE DISCOVERED THE GREATEST PART OF CALABRIA AND THE SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THE PHARE OF MES SINA THE LIPARI ISLANDS STROMBOLI WITH ITS SMOAKING TOP THOUGH AT ABOVE SEVENTY MILES DISTANCE SEEMED TO BE JUST UNDER OUR FEET WE SAW THE WHOLE ISLAND OF SICILY ITS RIVERS TOWNS HARBOURS C AS IF WE HAD BEEN LOOKING ON A MAP THE ISLAND OF MALTA IS LOW GROUND AND THERE WAS A HAZINESS IN THAT PART OF THE HORIZON SO THAT WE COULD NOT DISCERN IT OUR GUIDE ASSURED US HE HAD SEEN IT DISTINCTLY AT OTHER TIMES WHICH I CAN BELIEVE AS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE HORIZON THAT WERE NOT HAZY WE SAW TO A MUCH GREATER DIS TANCE BESIDES WE HAD A CLEAR VIEW OF ETNAS TOP FROM OUR SHIP AS WE WERE GOING INTO THE MOUTH OF THE HARBOUR OF MALTA SOME WEEKS BEFORE IN SHORT AS I HAVE SINCE MEASURED ON A GOOD CHART WE TOOK IN AT ONE VIEW A CIRCLE OF ABOVE NINE HUNDRED ENGLISH MILES THE PYRAMIDAL SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAIN REACHED ACROSS THE WHOLE ISLAND AND FAR INTO THE SEA ON THE OTHER SIDE I COUNTED FROM HENCE FORTYFOUR LITTLE MOUNTAINS LITTLE I CALL THEM IN COMPARISON OF THEIR MOTHER ETNA THOUGH THEY WOULD APPEAR GREAT ANY WHERE ELSE IN THE MIDDLE REGION ON THE CA TANIA13 TANIA SIDE AND MANY OTHERS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN ALL OF A CONICAL FORM AND EACH HAVING ITS CRATER MANY WITH TIMBER TREES FLOURISHING BOTH WITHIN AND WITHOUT THEIR CRATERS THE POINTS OF THOSE MOUNTAINS THAT I IMAGINE TO BE THE MOST ANCIENT ARE BLUNTED AND THE CRATERS OF COURSE MORE EXTENSIVE AND LESS DEEP THAN THOSE OF THE MOUNTAINS FORMED BY EXPLOSIONS OF A LATER DATE AND WHICH PRESERVE THEIR PYRAMIDAL FORM ENTIRE SOME HAVE BEEN SO FAR MOULDERED DOWN BY TIME AS TO HAVE NO OTHER AP PEARANCE OF A CRATER THAN A SORT OF DIMPLE OR HOLLOW ON THEIR ROUNDED TOPS OTHERS WITH ONLY HALF OR A THIRD PART OF THEIR CONE STANDING THE PARTS THAT ARE WANTING HAVING MOULDERED DOWN OR PERHAPS BEEN DETACHED FROM THEM BY EARTHQUAKES WHICH ARE HERE VERY FREQUENT ALL HOWEVER HAVE BEEN EVIDENTLY RAISED BY EXPLOSION AND I BELIEVE UPON EXAMINATION MANY OF THE WHIMFICAL SHAPES OF MOUNTAINS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WOULD PROVE TO HAVE BEEN OCCA SIONED BY THE SAME NATURAL OPERATIONS I OBSERVED THAT THESE MOUNTAINS WERE GENERALLY IN LINES OR RIDGES THEY HAVE MOSTLY A FRACTURE ON ONE SIDE THE SAME AS IN THE LITTLE MOUNTAINS RAISED BY EXPLOSION ON THE SIDES OF VESUVIUS OF WHICH THERE ARE EIGHT OR NINE THIS FRAC TURE IS OCCASIONED BY THE LAVAS FORCING ITS WAY OUT WHICH OPERATION I HAVE DESCRIBED IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE LAST ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS WHENEVER I SHALL MEET WITH A MOUNTAIN IN ANY PART OF THE WORLD WHOSE FORM IS REGULARLY CONICAL WITH A HOLLOW CRATER ON ITS TOP AND ONE SIDE BROKEN I SHALL BE APT TO DECIDE SUCH A MOUNTAINS HAVING BEEN FORMED BY AN ERUPTION AS BOTH ON ETNA AND VESUVIUS THE MOUNTAINS FORMED BY EXPLOSION14 EXPLOSION ARE WITHOUT EXCEPTION ACCORDING TO THIS DE SCRIPTION BUT TO RETURN TO MY NARRATIVE AFTER HAVING FEASTED OUR EYES WITH THE GLORIOUS PROSPECT ABOVEMENTIONED FOR WHICH AS SPARTIAN TELLS US THE EMPEROR ADRIAN WAS AT THE TROUBLE OF ASCENDING ETNA WE LOOKED INTO THE GREAT CRATER WHICH AS NEAR AS WE COULD JUDGE IS ABOUT TWO MILES AND A HALF IN CIRCUMFERENCE WE DID NOT THINK IT SAFE TO GO ROUND AND MEASURE IT AS SOME PARTS SEEMED TO BE VERY TENDER GROUND THE INSIDE OF THE CRATER WHICH IS INCRUSTED WITH SALTS AND SULPHURS LIKE THAT OF VESUVIUS IS IN THE FORM OF AN INVERTED HOLLOW CONE AND ITS DEPTH NEARLY ANSWERS TO THE HEIGHT OF THE LITTLE MOUNTAIN THAT CROWNS THE GREAT VOLCANO THE SMOAK ISSUING ABUNDANTLY FROM THE SIDES AND BOTTOM PREVENTED OUR SEEING QUITE DOWN BUT THE WIND CLEARING AWAY THE SMOAK FROM TIME TO TIME I SAW THIS INVERTED CONE CONTRACTED ALMOST TO A POINT AND FROM REPEATED OBSERVATIONS I DARE SAY THAT IN ALL VOLCANOS THE DEPTH OF THE CRATERS WILL BE FOUND TO CORRESPOND NEARLY TO THE HEIGHT OF THE CONICAL MOUNTAINS OF CINDERS WHICH USUALLY CROWN THEM IN SHORT I LOOK UPON THE CRATERSAS A SORT OF SUSPENDED FUNNELS UNDER WHICH ARE VAST CAVERNS AND ABYSSES THE FORMATION OF SUCH CONICAL MOUNTAINS WITH THEIR CRATERS ARE EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE FALL OF THE STONES CINDERS AND ASHES EMITTED AT THE TIME OF AN ERUPTION THE SMOAK OF ETNA THOUGH VERY SULPHUREOUS DID NOT APPEAR TO ME SO FETID AND DISAGREEABLE AS THAT OF VESUVIUS BUT OUR GUIDE TOLD ME THAT ITS QUALITY VARIES AS I KNOW THAT OF VESUVIUS DOES ACCORDING TO15 TO THE QUALITY OF THE MATTER THEN IN MOTION WITHIN THE AIR WAS SO VERY PURE AND KEEN IN THE WHOLE UPPER REGION OF ETNA AND PARTICULARLY IN THE MOST ELEVATED PARTS OF IT THAT WE HAD A DIFFICULTY IN RE SPIRATION AND THAT INDEPENDENT OF THE SULPHUREOUS VAPOUR I BROUGHT TWO BAROMETERS AND A THERMO METER WITH ME FROM NAPLES INTENDING TO HAVE LEFT ONE WITH A PERSON AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WHILST WE MADE OUR OBSERVATIONS WITH THE OTHER AT SUN RISING ON THE SUMMIT BUT ONE BAROMETER WAS UN LUCKILY SPOILT AT SEA AND I COULD FIND NO ONE EXPERT ENOUGH AT CATANIA TO REPAIR IT WHAT IS EXTRAORDINARY I DO NOT RECOLLECT HAVING SEEN A BAROMETER IN ANY PART OF SICILY AT THE FOOT OF ETNA THE 24TH WHEN WE MADE OUR FIRST OBSERVATION THE QUICKSILVER STOOD AT 27 DEGREES 4 LINES AND THE 26TH AT THE MOST ELEVATED POINT OF THE VOLCANO IT WAS AT 18 DEGREES 10 LINES THE THERMOMETER ON THE FIRST OBSERVATION AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN WAS AT 84 DEGREES AND ON THE SECOND AT THE CRATER AT 56 THE WEATHER HAD NOT CHANGED IN ANY RESPECT AND WAS EQUALLY FINE AND CLEAR THE 24TH AND 26TH WE FOUND IT DIFFICULT TO MANAGE OUR BAROMETER IN THE EXTREME COLD AND HIGH WIND ON THE TOP OF ETNA BUT FROM THE MOST EXACT OBSERVATIONS WE COULD MAKE IN OUR CIRCUMSTANCES THE RESULT WAS AS ABOVEMENTIONED THE CANON ASSURED ME THAT THE PERPENDICULAR HEIGHT OF MOUNT ETNA IS SOMETHING MORE THAN THREE ITALIAN MILES AND I VERILY BELIEVE IT IS SO AFTER HAVING PASSED AT LEAST THREE HOURS ON THE CRATER WE DESCENDED AND WENT TO A RISING GROUND ABOUT A MILE DISTANT FROM THE UPPER MOUNTAIN WE HAD JUST LEFT AND SAW THERE SOME REMAINS OF THE FOUN DATION16 DATION OF AN ANCIENT BUILDING IT IS OF BRICK AND SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ORNAMENTED WITH WHITE MARBLE MANY FRAGMENTS OF WHICH ARE SCATTERED ABOUT IT IS CALLED THE PHILOSOPHERS TOWER AND IS SAID TO HAVE BEEN INHABITED BY EMPEDOCLES AS THE ANCIENTS USED TO SACRIFICE TO THE CELESTIAL GODS ON THE TOP OF ETNA IT MAY VERY WELL BE THE RUIN OF A TEMPLE THAT SERVED FOR THAT PURPOSE FROM HENCE WE WENT A LITTLE FURTHER OVER THE INCLINED PLAIN ABOVEMEN TIONED AND SAW THE EVIDENT MARKS OF A DREADFUL TORRENT OF HOT WATER THAT CAME OUT OF THE GREAT CRATER AT THE TIME OF AN ERUPTION OF LAVA IN THE YEAR 1755 AND UPON WHICH PHAENOMENON THE CANONICO RECUPERO OUR GUIDE HAS PUBLISHED A DISSERTATION LUCKILY THIS TORRENT DID NOT TAKE ITS COURSE OVER THE INHABITED PARTS OF THE MOUNTAIN AS A LIKE ACCIDENT ON MOUNT VESUVIUS IN 1631 SWEPT AWAY SOME TOWNS AND VILLAGES IN ITS NEIGHBOURHOOD WITH THOU SANDS OF THEIR INHABITANTS THE COMMON RECEIVED OPINION IS THAT THESE ERUPTIONS OF WATER PROCEED FROM THE VOLCANOS HAVING A COMMUNICATION WITH THE SEA BUT I RATHER BELIEVE THEM TO PROCEED MERELY FROM DEPOSITIONS OF RAIN WATER IN SOME OF THE INWARD CAVITIES OF THEM WE LIKEWISE SAW FROM HENCE THE WHOLE COURSE OF AN ANCIENT LAVA THE MOST CONSIDERABLE AS TO ITS EXTENT OF ANY KNOWN HERE IT RAN INTO THE SEA NEAR TAORMINA WHICH IS NOT LESS THAN THIRTY MILES FROM THE CRATER WHENCE IT ISSUED AND IS IN MANY PARTS FIFTEEN MILES IN BREADTH AS THE LAVAS OF ETNA ARE VERY COMMONLY FIFTEEN AND TWENTY MILES IN LENGTH SIX OR SEVEN IN BREADTH AND FIFTY FEET OR MORE IN DEPTH YOU MAY JUDGE SIR OF THE PRO DIGIOUS QUANTITIES OF MATTER EMITTED IN A GREAT ERUPTION17 ERUPTION OF THIS MOUNTAIN AND OF THE VAST CAVITIES THERE MUST NECESSARILY BE WITHIN ITS BOWELS THE MOST EX TENSIVE LAVAS OF VESUVIUS DO NOT EXCEED SEVEN MILES IN LENGTH THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE ON THE ONE MOUN TAIN AND THE OTHER ARE CERTAINLY THE SAME BUT ON MOUNT ETNA ALL ARE UPON A GREAT SCALE AS TO THE NATURE AND QUALITY OF THEIR LAVAS THEY ARE MUCH THE SAME BUT I THINK THOSE OF ETNA RATHER BLACKER AND IN GENERAL MORE POROUS THAN THOSE OF VESUVIUS IN THE PARTS OF ETNA THAT WE WENT OVER I SAW NO STRATAS OF PUMICE STONES WHICH ARE FREQUENT NEAR VESUVIUS AND COVER THE ANCIENT CITY OF POMPEIA BUT OUR GUIDE TOLD US THAT THERE ARE SUCH IN OTHER PARTS OF THE MOUNTAIN I SAW SOME STRATAS OF WHAT IS CALLED HERE TUFFA IT IS THE SAME THAT COVERS HERCULANEUM AND THAT COMPOSES MOST OF THE HIGH GROUNDS ABOUT NAPLES IT IS UPON EXAMINATION A MIXTURE OF SMALL PUMICE STONES ASHES AND FRAGMENTS OF LAVA WHICH IS BY TIME HARDENED INTO A SORT OF STONE IN SHORT I FOUND WITH RESPECT TO THE MATTER ERUPTED NOTHING ON MOUNT ETNA THAT VESUVIUS DOES NOT PRODUCE AND THERE CER TAINLY IS A MUCH GREATER VARIETY IN THE ERUPTED MATTER AND LAVAS OF THE LATTER THAN OF THE FORMER BOTH ABOUND WITH PYRITES AND CRYSTALLIZATIONS OR RATHER VITRIFICATIONS THE SEA SHORE AT THE FOOT OF ETNA IN DEED ABOUNDS WITH AMBER OF WHICH THERE IS NONE FOUND AT THE FOOT OF VESUVIUS AT PRESENT THERE IS A MUCH GREATER QUANTITY OF SULPHUR AND SALTS ON THE TOP OF VESUVIUS THAN ON THAT OF ETNA BUT THIS CIR CUMSTANCE VARIES ACCORDING TO THE DEGREE OF FER MENTATION WITHIN AND OUR GUIDE ASSURED ME HE HAD SEEN GREATER QUANTITIES ON ETNA AT OTHER TIMES IN OUR WAY BACK TO CATANIA THE CANON SHEWED ME A V OL LX D LITTLE18 LITTLE HILL COVERED WITH VINES WHICH BELONGED TO THE JESUITS AND AS IS WELL ATTESTED WAS UNDERMINED BY THE LAVA IN THE YEAR 1669 AND TRANSPORTED HALF A MILE FROM THE PLACE WHERE IT STOOD WITHOUT HAVING DAMAGED THE VINES IN GREAT ERUPTIONS OF ETNA THE SAME SORT OF LIGHTEN ING AS DESCRIBED IN MY ACCOUNT OF THE LAST ERUPTION OF VESUVIUS HAS BEEN FREQUENTLY SEEN TO ISSUE FROM THE SMOAK OF ITS GREAT CRATER THE ANCIENTS TOOK NOTICE OF THE SAME PHAENOMENON FOR SENECA LIB II QUAEST NAT SAYS AETNA ALIQUANDO MULTO IGNE  ABUNDAVIT INGENTEM VIM ARENAE URENTIS EFFUDIT  INVOLUTUS EST DIES PULVERE POPULOSQUE SUBITA NOX  TERRUIT ILLO TEMPORE AIUNT PLURIMA FUISSE TONITRUA ET  FULMINA TILL THE YEAR 252 OF CHRIST THE CHRONOLOGICAL AC COUNTS OF THE ERUPTIONS OF ETNA ARE VERY IMPERFECT BUT AS THE VEIL OF ST AGATHA WAS IN THAT YEAR FIRST OPPOSED TO CHECK THE VIOLENCE OF THE TORRENTS OF LAVA AND HAS EVER SINCE BEEN PRODUCED AT THE TIME OF GREAT ERUPTIONS THE MIRACLES ATTRIBUTED TO ITS IN FLUENCE HAVING BEEN CAREFULLY RECORDED BY THE PRIESTS HAVE AT LEAST PRESERVED THE DATES OF SUCH ERUPTIONS THE RELICKS OF ST JANUARIUS HAVE RENDERED THE SAME SER VICE TO THE LOVERS OF NATURAL HISTORY BY RECORDING THE GREAT ERUPTIONS OF VESUVIUS I FIND BY THE DATES OF THE ERUPTIONS OF ETNA THAT IT IS AS IRREGULAR AND UN CERTAIN IN ITS OPERATIONS AS VESUVIUS THE LAST ERUPTION WAS IN 1766 ON OUR RETURN FROM MESSINA TO NAPLES WE WERE BECALMED THREE DAYS IN THE MIDST OF THE LIPARI ISLANDS BY WHICH WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF SEEING THAT THEY HAVE ALL BEEN EVIDENTLY FORMED BY EXPLOSION ONE OF THEM19 THEM CALLED VULCANO IS IN THE SAME STATE AS THE SOL FATERRA STROMBOLI IS A VOLCANO EXISTING IN ALL ITS FORCE AND IN ITS FORM OF COURSE IS THE MOST PYRA MIDAL OF ALL THE LIPARI ISLANDS WE SAW IT THROW UP RED HOT STONES FROM ITS CRATER FREQUENTLY AND SOME SMALL STREAMS OF LAVA ISSUED FROM ITS SIDE AND

j100000,Science,1637883,The New Catalogue of Chiroptera in the British Museum,i296252,OCTOBER 18 1912 there are several lantern slides illustrating the laboratory buildings of the world The system of classification is thus made elastic JOHN W HARSHBERGER THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE NEW CATALOGUE OF CHIROPTERA IN THE BRITISH MUSEUM DURING the past twentyfive years the study of recent mammals has been pursued with an activity unprecedented in the history of other groups of vertebrates Collections aggregating hundreds of thousands of specimens have been brought together mostly by three or four museums and the number of known forms whose existence was previously unsus pected has increased so rapidly that only a few specialists are fully aware of what has been taking place1 The trustees of the Brit ish Museum have recently issued the first vol ume of a second edition of the Catalogue of Chiroptera2 This is the first monographic treatment of a large group of mammals in which the systematic activities just alluded to are adequately summarized Its interest is therefore twofold to systematists an account of the technical matter which it contains and to general zoologists as the first definite indi cation of the extent to which currently ac cepted ideas regarding the worlds mammal fauna must be revised The volume now issued containing more than 900 pages is by Mr Knud Andersen who has spent nearly seven years in its prepa ration It deals with the Megachiroptera the old world fruitbats only No group of mam mals has ever been treated in such detail and it is doubtful whether any work of similar size on any group of vertebrates contains so large and so well arranged a mass of original 1 The field work which has led to this result was made possible by the invention of several types of small traps not originally intended for scientific purposes 2 Catalogue of the Chiroptera in the Collection of the British Museum second edition by Knud Andersen Vol I Megachiroptera London printed by order of the trustees etc 1912 Actual date of publication March 23 1912 observations The number of forms recog nized is 228 distributed among 38 genera and subgenera These are represented in the British Museum by 1470 specimens and all but 21 of the species and subspecies8 In the first edition of the catalogue Dobson 1878 the Megachiroptera occupy 98 pages with 78 forms and 13 genera and subgenera repre sented by 425 specimens This increase of nearly 300 per cent is probably less than may be expected among the insectivorous bats Microchiroptera Mr Andersens studies of the Microchiropterine genus Rhinolophus re sulted in an increase of from 21 to 105 or more while his Monograph of the Chirop teran Genera Uroderma Enchisthenes and Artibeus shows the old genus Artibeus with its six forms as understood by Dobson to consist of 32 forms representing three distinct genera The number of bats known to Dob son was about 440 it is to be expected that the number recorded in the new edition of the catalogue will exceed 2000 The significance of this increase will be understood when it is recalled that the entire number of living mammals is generally supposed to be about 5000 a total in which the bats form about one tenth In general plan the present volume agrees with the original edition and with the well known form of the British Museum  Cata logues With the increase of fineness in dis crimination however greater detail of treat ment has become necessary To take an ex ample at random in the original edition the account of Pteropus medius occupies two pages in Mr Andersens volume it covers seven and a half without counting two de voted to a race not recognized by Dobson This increase is due chiefly to the more elab orate description of characters but it is partly the result of greater detail in the bibliographic citations for the period covered by three lines under the name medius by Dobson 25 lines are here required Perhaps the most striking About 1000 specimens in other museums were also examined All of this outside material is care fully designated in the text or in footnotes SCIENCE 525N S VOL XXXVI No 929 special feature of the purely technical part of this work as compared with its predecessor is the different degree of importance accorded to cranial characters For Dobson the skull scarcely existed Thirty years ago there were separate skulls of only half the number of species of Megachiroptera then in the col lection whereas now every species and sub species in the museum with one exception Pteropus aruensis is represented by at least one and often by a series of skulls The orig inal edition contains figures of the skulls of 17 species of which only one is a fruitbat In the present volume the skulls of 47 species are figured and detailed cranial and dental measurements are given of practically every recognized form5 Another aspect in which AMr Andersens work differs from Dobsons is the relatively greater space allotted to speculation on such general subjects as distribution interrelation ships the relative primitiveness or specializa tion of species and the meaning of structures The interest of the volume is thus much in creased particularly because it is here that the greatest individual differences of opinion are likely to be encountered It is easy for instance to follow the author in his generic specific and subspecific splitting of the Cynopterus group but when he remarks of Sphcerias p 673 that It must use its in cisors in a way different from that of its rela tives as clearly shown by their remarkably proclivous position and peculiarly modified shape he appears to offer a greater unknown quantity to explain a less That is until some member of this group is known to feed on other substances than fruit pulp there is no reason to believe that the exact form of the small and mechanically unimportant incisor 4With two exceptions the 85 illustrations are original pen drawings by Mr A J Engel Terzi Their quality leaves nothing to be desired 5 The fact that the tables of measurements con tain maxima and minima only is one of the few details of plan open to adverse criticism The main object of making a series of measurements of the same part in a number of individuals is to discover what is normal we are here given the two records which are most unusual teeth is of consequence to the animals Such teeth in any mammal appear to assume any form readily developed from a generalized type and that special modes of use enter into the problem has not yet been shown however currently it may be assumed From the point of view of the general reader the discussion of geographic distribution pp lxxvxcii is of unusual interest Mr Ander sen here shows the fallacy of the popular idea that bats having wings roam where they will and of the more pernicious notion that philo sophizing is profitable without exact and de tailed knowledge of facts6 He says pp lxxvilxxviii The evidence afforded by the geographical dis tribution of bats has generally been considered of doubtful value    This unwillingness or hesita tion to place bats on an equal zoogeographical footing with nonflying mammalia would seem to be due partly to the preconceived idea that owing to their power of flight bats must evidently have been able easily to spread across barriers which in ordinary circumstances are insuperable for wingless mammalia partly to the fact that hith erto very often whole series of distinct forms have been concealed under one technical name So long as to mention only three cases among many Macroglossus minimus was believed to range un changed from the Himalayas to New Guinea Aus tralia and the Solomon Islands now two distinct genera thirteen recognizable forms or Cynop terus marginatus over India Ceylon IndoChina and IndoMalaya now six species fourteen forms or  hinolophus ferrumequinum  uniformly over Europe Asia and Africa now numerous distinct forms they were undoubtedly of questionable value as zoogeographical material But these and similar anomalies invariably disappear as soon as modern methods of discrimination applied on vastly increased material render it possible to draw the lines of separation between the species and their local modifications somewhat more closely in accordance with the lines drawn by nature The second argument referred to above that the spreading of bats from one locality to 6 One of the most persistent of modern zoological mythsthe belief that the rabbit of Porto Santo has developed recognizable characters within his toric timesarose from the failure to discriminate between the Mediterranean and central European races of a common mammal 526 SCIENCEOCTOBER 18 1912 another must obviously have been greatly facili tated by their possession of wings may in theory appear plausible enough but when tested on the actual distribution of the species and subspecies it proves to be of much less importance than com monly supposed it rests in reality on the con fusion of two different things the power of flight no doubt would enable a bat to spread over a much larger area than nonflying mammalia but as a matter of fact only in a very few cases is there any reason to believe that it has caused it to do soT  A few of the more striking examples may be mentioned here a species of Pteropus inhabits the island of Pemba south of Zanzibar but although the island is separated from Africa by a channel only 3540 miles wide not this par ticular species only but the whole genus is un known from any part of the adjacent continent8 although absent from Africa the genus Pteropus is distributed all over the Malagasy region9 and each group of islands    has its own peculiar species intermigration between the groups of islands is unknown the Epomophorine section of fruitbats is distributed over the whole of the Ethiopian region eight genera nineteen forms but not a single form has spread to any island of the Malagasy region the Pteropus melanotus group of five species is distributed over the Andamans Nicobars Nias Engano and Christmas Island south of Java and the whole group is confined to this chain of islands no form having spread to the neighboring Malay Peninsula or Sumatra The fruitbat faunas of the Malay Peninsula Sumatra and Borneo are closely interrelated like their mammalian faunas in general but each has 7 The preponderance of bats over the character istic IndoMalayan nonvolant types in the fauna of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands appears to be an instance in which wings have played a part in distribution Miller Proc U S Nat Mus XXIV pp 790791 May 28 1902 the presence of a slightly modified species of Nyeteris a char acteristic American type of bat as the only in digenous mammal of the IHawaiian Islands is prob ably another case of the same kind 8 Conversely six species of European bats Myotis myotis M dasycneme M emarginatus Pipistrellus natusii Eptesicus nilssonii and Ves pertilio murinus although occurring on or near the west coast from Brittany northward are not known to have become established in England 9 It ranges eastward through the    Oriental and Australian regions to the Samoa Islands some distinct autochthonous forms of fruitbats Borneo even two autochthonous 10 genera as it has of other Mammalia the Javan mammalian fauna in general is more peculiar both by the absence of some of the forms found in Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula and by the greater per centage of autochthonous forms and this is again borne out by the Megachiropterine fauna of the island    the Pteropus rayneri group is repre sented probably all over the Solomon Islands but it has differentiated into five distinct species one in the Bougainville group a second on Villa Lavella a third in the New Georgia group a fourth on Guadaleanar and a fifth on San Cristobal This    tends to show that the present distribu tion of the Megachiroptera has not been influenced to any great and as a rule not even to any appre ciable extent by their power of flight if it had the fruitbat fauna of one group of islands could not so commonly as is actually the case differ from that of a neighboring group or continent and the tendency to differentiation of insular species or forms would have been neutralized by the free intercourse between neighboring faunas GERRIT S MILLER SPECIAL ARTICLES THE PRODUCTION OF SPERM ISOAGGLUTININS BY OVA I If one allows unfertilized eggs of Ar bacia to stand in a quantity of seawater that does not exceed about ten times the volume of the eggs the seawater soon becomes per ceptibly tinged with the red coloring matter of the eggs If now a few drops of such super natant seawater be added to 2 or 3 cc of a milky suspension of active sperm of the same species a strong agglutination of the sperms immediately ensues producing spermmasses easily visible to the naked eye In the course of three to five minutes reversal takes place the masses become converted into their con stituent cells and considerable activity may be observed after the reversal on microscopical examination The substance which produces this phenomenon may be called a sperm ag glutinin and since it is produced by the same species an isoagglutinin This basic phenomenon was studied in three 1o Further exploration will probably show that both occur on the peninsula or in Sumatra SCIENCE 527

was a judgment for plaintiff and defendant brings error Reversed and remanded for new trial John M JohnsolA and Leo P Harloz for plaintiff in error Crandall Mackay and Win B Rielly for defendant in error KEITH P This suit was brought by Mary A Burroughs as beneficiary of William J Burroughs deceased in the corporation court of the city of Alexandria against the Knights of Columbus a corporation incorporated under the laws of the state of Con necticut and doing business in the state of Virginia The de fendant appeared and pleaded non assumpsit and two special pleas The plaintiff took issue upon the first plea and filed special replication to the second and third pleas Issue was joined thereon The jury gave a verdict for the plaintiff for the sum of 1000 The court rendered judgment upon that verdict and the case is now before us upon a writ of error The plaintiff in error here defendant in the court below assigns as error the ruling of the court in granting three in structions asked for by the defendant in error as shown by bill of exceptions No 1 Upon referring however to that bill it appears that only one instruction is mentioned which is in the following words May 40KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS The jury are instructed that the local lodge had the power to advance assessments for its delinquent members unless there was something in the constitution and bylaws of the national or subordinate council prohibiting such advances If other instructions were given at the instance of the plaintiff they are not properly part of the record and cannot be considered by this court At the conclusion of the printed transcript of the record it does appear that three instructions were granted at the instance of the plaintiff We have quoted instruction No 1 and instructions Nos 2 and 3 not having been embraced in the bill of the exceptions cannot be considered by us From bill of exceptions No 2 it appears that the court was asked to grant plaintiff in error three instructions which the court refused to do and its refusal is assigned as error These instructions are as follows The court instructs the jury that if they believe from the evidence that William J Burroughs failed neglected or refused to pay his assessment for the months of April May June July August and September 1904 in the time prescribed by the by laws that being the regular monthly assessment due by him and after he had been requested to pay same by Richard L Came Jr the financial secretary of Fitzgerald Council No 459 Knights of Columbus then he forfeited his membership in the Knights of Columbus and the plaintiff cannot recover in this action The jury are futher instructed that as a matter of law the receipt of said money by the said Came financial secretary of Fitzgerald Council No 459 Knights of Columbus on behalf of said William J Burroughs was without right or authority on his part and that the acceptance by him of said money was not a waiver of the conditions by the said defendant under which said benefit certificate was issued To the contrary each and every benefit certificate is issued only upon the conditions stated in and subject to the constitution and bylaws of the order of said Knights of Columbus The jury are further instructed that the said Richard L Came Jr as financial secretary of the said Fitzgerald Council No 459 Knights of Columbus and said Fitzgerald Council No 459 Knights of Columbus in administering the powers and duties provided under the laws of said defendant were not the agents of the said order but the agents of the members thereof and that the acceptance of said money by said Carne after said forfeiture of membership of said William J Burroughs did not create or cannot be construed to create any liability on the part of said de fendant to said plaintiff Therefore the verdict should be for the defendant The evidence before the jury in the light of which these in 1908 4114 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER structions are to be considered was as follows The Knights of Columbus is a corporation organized under the laws of the state of Connecticut for the purpose of carrying on a system of fra ternal insurance by means of subordinate lodges located through out the various states of the Union Of these subordinate lodges one was known as Fitzgerald Council No 459 located in Alex andria Va One of the members of this council was William J Burroughs who made application for membership on April 14 1902 and to whom a benefit certificate was issued on the 25th day of June 1902 By the terms of this certificate Burroughs agreed to comply with all the requirements and conditions therein set out and also those contained in the original application made by him for membership in the organization He agreed to comply with the constitution laws rules and regulations governing the defendant order and the defendant agreed to pay to the bene ficiary plaintiff in this action Mary A Burroughs the sum of 1000 provided that the said William J Burroughs was at the time of his death a member of said order in good standing all of which conditions and provisions were accepted and subscribed to by Burroughs in his benefit certificate Burroughs during the time of his membership agreed to pay certain assessments as provided for in defendants laws sections 85 and 89 There was due from Burroughs an assessment for the month of April 1904 for the sum of 80 cents which was not paid nor were the assessments paid for the months of May June July August and September 1904 Section 167 of plaintiff in errors bylaws provides Any member of this order shall ipso facto forfeit his membership in the order who fails neglects or refuses to pay his proportionate part of any assessment for thirty days from the date of mailing or transmitting the notice for assessment by the secretary of his council or of the regular monthly assessment within thirty days from the first day of the month in which levied By section 217 it is provided A member of the order sus pended for nonpayment of assessments dues or fines wishing to be reinstated must within one year from the date of suspension make writtten application to and at a meeting of the council from which he was suspended upon a blank issued by the order Said application shall be balloted upon and forwarded by the financial secretary to the national secretary with the ap proval or disapproval of the council recorded thereon and with the certificate of the financial secretary that all arrearages of assessments and dues have been paid If an in surance member the committee on reinstatement shall then act upon said application and the applicant can only be reinstated upon such conditions as said committee may direct and determine provided if such application is made within three months from 42 MayKNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS date of forfeiture of membership the provisions of this section relative to ballot and approval by the council shall not apply If an associate member no action of the committee on reinstate ment is necessary Upon approval of the council and otherwise complying with this section he is reinstated By section 125 of the bylaws it is provided No money shall be paid or transferred from the treasury of any council except such moneys as the council is called upon to regularly pay for its current expenses and as provided by the laws of the order or for purposes approved by the national council or board of direct ors unless by a twothirds vote of the members present and vot ing at a regular meeting held subsequent to a regular meeting at which notice in writing of a resolution or intention to pay or transfer such money and the purposes and amount to be paid or transferred shall have been given and regularly read The benefit certificate copied in the record appears to have been issued on the express condition that the statements made by the applicanf in his application for nlembership are warranted as true and made a part of the contract and upon the further condi tion that said mclmber complies in the future with the constitu tion laws and regulations now governing said order or that may hereafter be enacted to govern said order And in section 12 of his application he covenants that he will conform to and abide by the constitution bylaws rules and regulations of said order and of any council thereof of which I may at any time be a mem ber which may now be in force or which may at any time here after be adopted by the proper authorities or submit to the pen alty now or hereafter provided for the breach or violation of such constitution bylaws rules of regulations William J Burroughs died on October 15 1904 He had failed to pay his assessments for the months of April May June July August and September 104 It was shown by the evidence of the financial secretary of Fitzgerald Council that it was the cus tom of that council to keep at the dues of members who were in arrearsto use his own language The council ordered me to carry every man That was passed at every meeting for every assessment It was always paid within 30 days Before I would have a chance to read the delinquent list a motion would be made that we carry the delinquents That this action was taken by the local board knowing that some of the members were de linquent and before a list of the delinquents could be read a motion would be made to carry them all These payments for Burroughs and other delinquents were made by warrant drawn on the treasurer against the insurance fund It appears from the evidence of the financial secretary that he called upon Burroughs frequently for his assessments and he 1908 4314 VIRGINIA LAW RtGISTER would do so upon an average of twice a month at his home at his place of employment and elsewhere The defendant in error proved by another witness that it was the custom for the secretary of the national council to forward to the Fitzgerald Council a statement of the amount due for in surance members and the secretary of the local council would then forward the amount by check that the local lodge kept alive the membership of all its members by paying their dues that up to the time of the death of Burroughs the local council had car ried members from month to month and paid the assessments out of the general fund and that Burroughs had been asked to meet the assessments due by him and he always replied that he would do so at the next meeting He never in terms refused to pay It further appears that the secretary of the national council had no knowledge of the custom of the local council and when he received checks was not aware that they were in part for money advanced to meet the assessments of delinquent members of the subordinate lodge Some time after Burroughs the insured became ill and four days before his death to wit on October 11 1904 the sum of 1040 was paid to the financial secretary of the Fitzgerald Coun cil in settlement of the amount that lodge had theretofore ad vanced to the national council on account of assessments against William J Burroughs The Knights of Columbus is a beneficial association organized for the purpose of carrying on a system of fraternal insurance and not for the purpose of gain and profit The nonpayment of dues and assessments in such an organization is subversive of the fundamental object of the society tends to its destruction and is a violation of the members duty as a corporator Not only has such a society an inherent right to expel members for nonpayment of dues and assessments but from its nature and necessities it has a right to provide in its laws that such non payment within a stipulated time after notice shall without per sonal or other notice to the delinquent member ipso facto work a forfeiture of all the members rights of membership Niblack on Ben Soc  Accident Ins 2d Ed  39 In Klein v Insurance Co 104 U S 88 26 L Ed 662 it is said A condition in a policy of life insurance that if the stip ulated premium shall not be paid on or before a certain day the policy shall cease and determine is of the very essence and sub stance of the contract Against a forfeiture caused by failure to pay a court of equity cannot relieve And in Thompson v Insurance Co 104 U S 252 26 L Ed 765 is is said Where the policy provides that it shall be for feited upon the failure of the assured to pay the annual premium May 44KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS ad diem or to pay at maturity his promissory note therefor the acceptance by the company of the note although a waiver of such payment of the premium brings into operation so much of the condition as relates to the note Prompt payment said the court and regular interest constitutes the life and soul of the life insurance business and the sentiment long prevailed that it could not be carried on without the ability to impose stringent conditions for delinquency More liberal views have obtained on this subject in recent years and a wiser policy now often pro vides express modes of avoiding the odious result of forfeiture The law however has not been changed and if a forfeiture is provided for in case of nonpayment at the day the courts cannot grant relief against it The insurer may waive it or may by his conduct lose his right to enforce it but that is all In Metropolitan Life Ins Co v Hall 104 Va 572 52 S E 345 it is said An insured should look at his policy and con form to it and limitations of the agents authority should be ef fective unless the insurance company by a course of business or otherwise has waived the limitation on the agents power of waiver An agent to collect premiums has no authority to ex tendl the time of payment of an overdue premium and where the policy declares a forfeiture for failure to pay at maturity and forbids waiver by agents their agreements to extend time of pay ment do not as a rule bind the company See also United Moderns v Rathbun 104 Va 736 52 S E 552 In Mut F Ins Co v Miller Lodge I O O F 58 Md 463 it was held that when a party takes out a policy in a mutual in surance company and the contract is complete he at once be comes a member and is bound by the rules and provisions of the charter and bylaws of the company and he is presumed to have knowledge of them all   Although there may be a habit or usage of the company to give notice to the members of the amount of the annual interest and the time of payment yet if no obligation to give such notice is created by the charter or bylaws of the company there is nothing in such habit or usage that could impose such a duty upon the company witl the conse quence of making the notice a condition precedent to the right of tle company to receive the interest on the premium note accord ing to the contract of insurance The company is under no obli gation to give such notice and assumes no responsibility in giving it The duty of the assured to pay at the day is the same whether notice be given or not Applying the principles of that case to the one before us there can be no doubt that the insured was bound by the rules and provisions of the charter and bylaws of the order of which he was a member and that he was conclusively presumed to have knowledge of them all with this difference between the two 1908 4514 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER cases that in that under consideration there is no evidence of any habit or usage of the national council to grant indulgence to its members or to give them notice of delinquency or that there was any obligation upon its part to do so or any knowledge that any such usage or habit had grown up in and was practiced by the local lodge In Rood v Ben Assn C C 31 Fed 62 it is held that where the laws of a benefit society provide that if a member neglects or refuses to pay any assessment for a specified period he shall cease to be a member and the secretary shall strike his name from the roll such laws are selfexecuting and the member so omitting to pay loses his rights as a member although the secretary does not strike his name from the roll In McDonald v RossLewin 29 Hun N Y 87 section 1 art 10 of the bylaws of the association provided that if any member should neglect to pay any dues or assessments required by the bylaws then and in such case such membership shall cease and determine at once without notice and all claims be for feited to the association It was held that the neglect to pay an assessment for 30 days after notice thereof ipso facto determined the membership of the clelinquent In Illinois Masons Benevolent Society v Baldwin 86 Ill 479 it was held Where a certificate of membership in a society which provides for paying a certain sum of money on the death of the member also requires the party to pay all assessments against him within 10 days after notice thereof or the certificate shall be null and void and the bylaws of the society provide that a party failing to pay his assessments within 10 days after notice shall forfeit his membership and all benefits therefrom and the party in his application for membership agreed to be bound by the rules and regulations of the society a failure or neglect to pay an assessment within 10 days after notice of the same will prevent any recovery upon the certificate upon his death unless there is shown a waiver of the forfeiture or facts estopping the society from insisting upon the same that when a party in de fault in the payment of assessments against him as a member of a benevolent society has not been induced by the society or its agents to do or to omit to do any act which he would not other wise have done or omitted the society will not be estopped from insisting upon a forfeiture of his rights for his neglect to pay Proof of a custonl is never admitted to overcome or change the express terms of a contract Proof by a witness that in certain instances known to him a forfeiture was not exacted without showing this to be uniform and its duration is not sufficient to show a custom While the authorities concur in conceding the right of bene ficial societies in their constitutions and bylaws and in their con 46 MayKNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS tracts of insurance to impose conditions a failure to comply with which is vested with a forfeiture of all rights in the society there is some apparent diversity of opinion among the cases as to whether or not it is necessary for the society to give notice or take any formal action in order to make the forfeiture effectual But it will be found we think upon a careful examination of the authorities that the difference really grows out of the construc tion of the constitution and bylaws of the particular society If for instance the laws of the society provide that the nonpayment of an assessment continuing for a special time shall operate ipso facto to determine the connection between the society and the delinquent member and to forfeit his rights as such member we know of no case in which the power of such a society to make and enforce such a rule has been denied but where in accord ance with the terms of the constitution and bylaws of the so ciety anything is to be done on the part of the society itself to make the expulsion of the member complete to terminate his rights and interests in the society the courts require a strict compliance with the course of procedure prescribed and are astute to discover any departure which will enable them to interfere and prevent a forfeiture For example in Maderia v Merchants Exchange Mut Ben Soc C C 16 Fed 749 where a certificate of membership in the nature of a life policy issued by the mutual society provided that the amount of insurance therein specified should be paid in case of the members death to his beneficiary on condition that he had complied with the bylaws of the society and the bylaws provided that members should forfeit their membership if they failed to pay their dues within 30 days after publication of an as sessment and it appeared from the evidence that the assured had failed to pay an assessment within the time specified and that it remained unpaid at the time of his death it was held that he had forfeited his membership and that there could be no recovery under his certificate So in Borgraefe v Supreme Lodge Knights and Ladies of Honor 22 Mo App 127 it was held that under a law of a benevolent society which makes the nonpayment of assessments for a given period after notice operate as a suspension ipso facto of the delinquent member it is not necessary that the suspension should be judicially determined by any judicatory of the order In Baconon Ben Soc  L Ins vol 2  385 after a full con sideration of the subject and the citation of numerous authori ties upon the one part and the other the conclusion is reached that if by the laws of the society nonpayment of an assessment operates as a forfeiture time is of the essence of the contract and the member must elect every time he is called upon to pay an assessment either to pay within the stipulated time or suffer 1908 4714 VIRGINIA ILAW REGISTER the penalty of loss of membership and its benefits by neglecting or refusing to pay within that time    The question is one of construction and we give in a note the cases not hereto fore cited holding that ipso facto suspension resulted from non payment and also those holding to the contrary An examina tion of these diverse authorities will show that in every case in which it was held that the failure to pay did not operate a sus pension ipso facto there was something in a just construction of the constitution and bylaws which showed that affirmative ac tion on the part of the society was necessary in other words that in all such cases the nonpayment of the dues and assess ments did not under the particular constitution or bylaws oper ate ipso facto and by its own force to terminate membership in the society In concluding the discussion of this branch of the case we shall refer to section 289 of Niblack on Ben Soc 2d Ed The whole of the section is pertinent but too long for quotation It is in part as follows However abhorrent it may be to all reason to permit the expulsion of a member witliout notice and hearing or opportunity to be heard for an alleged violation of his duty as a citizen or a corporator and notwithstanding the fact that a bylaw providing that on such charges a member may be expelled by the vote of the society in his absence and without notice is illegal and invalid it may be laid down as certain that from the very nature of the plan of mutual assessment insurance it is proper for mutual benefit societies to provide that nonpay ment of an assessment withina specified time after notice shall ipso facto work a forfeiture of the insurance and an expulsion of the defaulting member It is true that where such stringent clauses of forfeiture are male a part of the contract they are usually accompanied by provisions for the reinstatement of the delinquent member upon equitable terms but such provisions are not necessary to the validity of the terms of forfeiture These societies depend exclusively upon the payment of assessments to meet their losses and expenses and only by the prompt payment of assessments by their members can they maintain their sol vency aind responsihility The only practical way which they have of enforcifg payment of their assessments is by forfeiting in surance contracts and expelling the delinquent members for non payment and this power is necessary for the existence of such societies To hold that specific notice to the member must be given of the time and place at which he will be called upon to answer the charge of having failed to pay his assesment within the stipulated time and that a judicial act of the society ex pelling the delinquent member is necessary in order to terminate his rights under the contract and to hold further that such pro ceedings may not be waived by express contract of the parties May 48KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS would be to extend unduly the period of insurance beyond the time for which a consideration had been paid would offer en couragement to careless members and greatly impair the ability of the societies to carry on the work for which they are or ganized In Knights of Honor v Oeters 95 Va 610 29 S E 322 Judge Riely speaking for this court said The forfeiture of a cer tificate in a benefit society is not waived by the fact that the finan cial reporter of a subordinate lodge is in the habit of receiving payment of assessments after the end of the month for which they are levied and within which they are payable under the penalty of suspension and a forfeiture of the benefit certificate when there is no evidence that the supreme lodge which is sued on the certificate is aware of such habit In Supreme Council Royal Arcanum v Taylor 121 Fed 66 57 C C A 406 the court says A fraternal benefit association cannot be deemed to have waived a condition of its contract with a member requiring the payment of an assessment on or before the last day of each calendar month without notice and which provided that in default of such payment the member should stand suspended and prohibited the collector of the local council from receiving an assessment after the day it became due nor was it estopped to insist upon such suspension which occurred some days before the members death because on some previous occasion he had paid after the close of the month where that fact was not reported to the local council nor known to the su preme council but where iti fact the assessment had in each case been advanced for him by the collector under an arrangement between them In Modern Woodmen of America z Tevis 117 Fed 369 54 C C A 293 the court says Stipulations to insure the prompt payment of benefit assessments constitute the substance and the essence of insurance contracts of beneficial associations and that the insured and the beneficiaries under contracts with insurance companies and beneficial associations are charged with knowledge of the limitations upon the powers of the agents of the companies which are found in the policies or certificates or in the bylaws or applications which are a part of their contracts and they are bound by these limitations In that case the bylaws of the Modern Woodmen of America which constituted a part of the contract with its members and beneficiaries provided that a member who fails to pay a benefit assessment at the time specified for its payment is ipso facto suspended and his benefit certificate is thenceforth void that he may be reinstated within a certain time if in good health by furnishing a warranty of that fact and paying his

head camp suspended mem bers that he is the agent of the local camp and not of the head camp and that no act or omission by him shall create any liability or waive any immunity or right of the society It was held that the clerk of the local camp is the agent of the head camp to col lect and remit the benefit assessments in accordance with the terms of the bylaws that his authority is limited by the bylaws and the members and beneficiaries are charged with knowl edge of these limitations because they are a part of their con tracts and that the clerk of the local camp has no authority by contract estoppel or waiver to bind the society to its members or beneficiaries either by extending the time of payment of a benefit assessment or by waiving default in its payment or by rein stating a suspending member without a warranty of good health in the absence of notice or knowledge of such acts and acqui escence therein by some of the principal officers of the head camp There is much in that case which resembles the one under con sideration In Jelly v Muscatine City and County Mut Aid Society 120 Iowa 689 95 N W 197 98 Am St Rep 378 it was held that a provision in the constitution of a mutual benefit society that a member failing to pay his assessment within 15 days after being notified by the secretary shall be suspended is not a selfexecuting provision and a member who has failed to pay within the time is still in good standing no action having been taken to suspend him Construing this provision of the constitution the court says The expression shall be suspended as the same appears in said article is declaratory merely of the right of the association to suspend for nonpayment of assessments and it cannot be said that membership or standing has been lost or forfeited as long as the society does not see fit to exercise such right A mere delinquency of a member of a mutual benefit association to pay dues or assessments does not defeat his good standing as long as he has a right to pay and the association forbears to take action cited among other cases Petherick zv Order 114 Mich 420 72 N W 262 In Warwick v Supreme Conclave Knights of Damon 107 Ga 115 32 S E 951 it was held that the nonpayment of an as sessment made upon the member for the common benefit fund which has become due and payable under the laws of the associa tion will not ipso facto amount to a forfeiture of the benefit of life insurance provided for in the certificate it appearing that there is no law or rule of the association expressly providing that such nonpayment will of itself work a forfeiture In Puhr v Grand Lodge German Order of Harugari 77 Mo May 50KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS App 47 it was held that under the constitution and bylaws of the defendant society a mere delinquency in the payment of dues does not defeat the good standing of a member So long as the member has a right to pay and the lodge forbears to take action he remains in good standing The provision of the bylaws in that case was that members who owe three months dues and assessments shall in the first meeting of the fourth month be stricken from the membership roll The court was of the opin ion that under that section the delinquency of the member would not ipso facto result in a forfeiture of membership until the first meeting of the local lodge in the fourth month after the default and that a construction which summarily deprives the member of his rights is not favored and it will not be adopted if any other is possible In American Council O U A M v National Council O U A M of the U S of America 63 N J Law 52 43 Atl 2 a bylaw provided that if a member should fail to have his assess ments in the hands of the secretary within 30 davs from the date of the call he should forfeit his right to receive benefits until all arrearages were paid and that if 30 days should elapse before all arrearages were paid the member should be suspended from the department It was held that a failure to pay assessments within 30 days after they became due did not of itself operate to suspend the defaulting member but that affirmative action on the part of the society was required to produce that result The court in its opinion laid stress upon the expression shall be suspended contending that action is to be taken by the national council for the accomplishment of that result after the default has continued for the specified time and until such proceedings are taken and completed the local council still retains its membership in the de partment All of which goes to show that as we before remarked courts are astute and we may add properly so to discover modes of escape from declaring a forfeiture To the same effect see Order of United Commercial Travelers v McAdam 125 Fed 358 61 C C A 22 La Marsh v Society 68 N I 229 38 Atl 1045 It will be sufficient to recur to section 167 of the bylaws of the Knights of Columbus to show that there is no room for discus sion or doubt as to the effect of a failure to pay an assessment for the stipulated period Any member of this order shall ipso facto forfeit his membership in the order who fails neglects or refuses to pay his proportionate part of any assessment for thirty days from the date of mailing or transmitting the notice for as sessment by the secretary of his council or of the regular monthly assessment within thirty days from the first day of the month in which levied This brings us to a proposition much relied upon by defendant 1908 5114 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER in error As we uderstand her position she did not rely and under the evidence in this case could not have relied upon any waiver or estoppel upon the part of plaintiff in error The de fendant in error stands squarely upon the proposition that the Fitzgerald Council had the right to pay and did pay the dues and assessments of its members that the payment of all the dues of all its members by the local council to the national council satisfied all legal demands of the national council and that as the amount which the local council had advanced on behalf of Burroughs was during his lifetime paid to and received by it he died a member in good standing In OGrady v Knights of Columbus 62 Conn 223 25 Atl 111 the construction of the constitution and bylaws of this society as they then existed that case having been decided in 1892 became necessary One of the regulations of the society at that time provided that the endowment should be paid upon the death of any member    in good standing at the time of his demise and that a member should be deemed in good standing for the purpose of claiming endowment who at the time of his death was not indebted to his council Another article provided that members four months in arrears for dues shall be ipso facto suspended and that members legally suspended shall not be entitled to any of the privileges of membership whatever until reinstated according to law It was held that the right of the beneficiary of a deceased member to recover the endowment depended on the question whether the member at the time of his death was indebted to his council and not upon the question whether he had been suspended and not reinstated In that case the member at the time of his death was indebted to his council for several assessments and had been suspended and not rein stated A few hours before his death his beneficiary paid the amount due to the financial secretary of his council and took a receipt for it It was held that this payment did not effect a reinstatement of the member but that it did extinguish his in debtedness to his council so that at the time of his death he was not indebted and his beneficiary was entitled to the endowment Since that case was decided the laws of the order have been amended and as amended again came under the consideration of the Supreme Court of Connecticut in the case of Coughlin v Knights of Columbus 79 Conn 218 64 Atl 223 where it was held that the terms of a contract between a member of a benefit society and the society stipulating that the member agrees to subject himself to the constitution and bylaws of the order are determined by the constitution and bylaws of the order as exist ing when the member became a member and as amended from time to time It appeared in that case that notwithstanding the May 52KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS constitution and laws of the society it had been the practice for a long time of the members of subordinate councils not to pay their monthly assessments until required to do so by a collecting officer appointed by the council and it had been the practice of its financial secretary to receive the money so paid after the ex piration of 30 days from the first day of the month and not to state in his monthly report to the national secretary the fact that certain members had paid their assessments after the time pre scribed by law for payment had expired The national secretary with knowledge of this practice continued to issue each regu lar monthly assessment against the subordinate council based upon the number of insurance members of the council as thus reported to him by the financial secretary and to receive and ac cept from the treasurer of that council the full amount of each such monthly assessment This practice continued with the knowledge of the other officers of the order charged with duties in connection with issuing and receiving assessments for the death benefit fund against the subordinate council A similar practice had for a long time prevailed in the other councils of the order in respect to the payment by their members of their regular monthly assessments and a similar practice with respect to the issue and collection of assessments against the other coun cils of the order had in like manner prevailed Coughlin know ing of this practice in fact believed that he was not required to pay his monthly assessment within 30 days from the first day of the month and that he might lawfully pay the same after the ex piration of that time so long as he paid when requested so to do by the proper officer of his council and acting on this belief he did not pay the assessments mentioned in the answer within 30 days from the first day of the month but did pay the same after the expiration of that time to the financial secretary of his coun cil The court in its opinion says The foregoing facts are alleged in the reply and for the purpose of testing its legal suf ficiency are admitted by the demurrer and held that the laws of a fraternal benefit society providing for a monthly assessment against each subordinate council on the number of its members as reported monthly payable immediately after the first day of the month and that each member of a council should pay his reg ular monthly assessments within 30 days from the first day of each month under penalty of ipso facto suspension for failure to so pay the payment by the treasurer of a subordinate council of the monthly assessment immediately after the first day of each month was not a payment by any member of the council of his individual monthly assessment and that the fact that a member believed that a violation of the laws of the society was justified did not save him from the penalty of suspension that a subordinate 1908 5314 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTIR council could not waive the conditions on which a members benefit certificate was issued or change the provisions of the laws of the order with respect to the time of payment of monthly assessments and that the officers of the society in dealing with the members thereof were acting as special agents under a special authority the limits of which were known to the members and their acts in allowing members to pay assessments after the time fixed did not operate either by way of waiver or estoppel to pre vent the society from maintaining a defense to an action on a benefit certificate based on the failure of the member to pay a monthly assessment within the time fixed that the fact that a subordi nate council adopted a practice of not requiring its members to pay their monthly assessments until required to do so by a col lecting officer appointed by the council and the financial secre tary received the money so paid after the expiration of 30 days after the first day of the month did not effect a change in the laws of the society which under its terms could only be changed by the national council It needs no comment to show that the case just cited is im measurably stronger on behalf of the beneficiary than the case under consideration See Grand Lodge Ancient Order United Workmen v Cressey 47 Il App 616 In Borgraefe v Supreme Lodge etc supre it was held that the beneficiaries of a member of a benevolent society who stands suspended for nonpayment of assessments by operation of the laws of the society at the time of his death cannot recover on the benefit certificate on the ground that the subordinate lodge of which he was a member had continued to treat him as a member and to treat his unpaid dues to the supreme lodge as dues payable to the subordinate lodge for which it had extended him credit In Grand Lodge Ancient Order United Workmen v Jesse 50 Ill App 101 a member of a subordinate lodge failed to pay an assessment and his certificate by operation of the rules be came suspended These rules provided that it might be renewed within a period of three months from the date of suspension upon the condition that all assessments made during the time of suspension should be paid and if not done within 30 days from such date a certificate of good health should be furnished After the expiration of 30 days his delinquent assessments were paid by his wife to the financier of the subordinate lodge but no cer tificate of health was furnished A minute of the payment and reinstatement was made on the books of the subordinate lodge and the money forwarded to the proper officer of the general lodge who refused to receive it because no certificate of health accompanied it and returned the same to the subordinate lodge 54 MayKNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS V BURROUGHS It was returned to the wife of the member who paid it The minute upon the books of the reinstatement etc was stricken out and an entry made that because of the mental illness of the member and his inability to produce a certificate of health as re quired by the rules of the grand lodge his suspension was upheld The court held that as the rules of the grand lodge provided the only method of reinstating a beneficiary certificate after it had been suspended for 30 days the officer of the subordinate lodge could not waive the requirements that a subordinate lodge and its officers have no authority to waive any rules of the grand lodge which relate to the substance of a contract between an in dividual member and the grand lodge Modern Woodmen of America v Tevis supra is authority upon this point also It appears from the testimony of the financial secretary in this case that in making payments to the national council he drew his warrant on the treasurer of the local council against the in surance fund Section 125 of the bylaws provides that no money shall be paid or transferred from the treasury of any coun cil except such moneys as the council is called upon to regularly pay for its current expenses and as provided by the laws of the order or for purposes approved by the National Council or board of directors unless by a twothirds vote of the members present and voting at a regular meeting held subsequent to a regular meeting at which notice in writing of a resolution or intention to pay or transfer such money and the purposes and amount to be paid or transferred shall have been given and regularly read which would seem to be a sufficiently expressed inhibition upon the local council to do the very thing which it did do in this case We are of the opinion that by his failure to pay his assess ments as provided by the constitution and bylaws William J Burroughs ipso facto forfeited his membership in the order of Knights of Columbus that the subordinate local council in un dertaking to make good the delinquencies of its members by its warrants drawn by its financial secretary against the insurance fund without complying with section 125 of the bylaws acted without authority tlrat in so acting it was the agent of its mem bers and not of the national council and that the national coun cil having received the money in ignorance of the facts has not waived the forfeiture and is not by it conduct estopped to set it up in defense to this action For these reasons we are of the opinion that the instructions set out in bill of exceptions No 1 asked for by defendant in error considered in the light of the facts of this case is erroneous and should have been refused and that the instructions asked for by plaintiff in error set out in bill of exceptions No 2 should have been granted The judgment of the corporation court is 19081 5514 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER therefore reversed and the cause remanded for a new trial in accordance with the views presented in this opinion Reversed Note The rulings of the court in this case are clearly right as is abund antly shown by the references to cases and text books in the opinion but as many of the points decided have previously been passed on in an unreported case in Virginia it may be interesting to note its hold ings here Right to ReinstatementA member of a benevolent association can not maintain an action to compel the reinstatement of a benefit certificate which has been forfeited by nonpayment of an assessment after the expiration of the time fixed by the bylaws of the association within which such action may be brought Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 Limitation of Time for PaymentA limitation of six months in the bylaws of a benevolent association within which an assessment may be questioned is valid Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 Assessment Levied in Violation of Charter and ByLawsA benev olent association can not declare a benefit certificate forfeited for the nonpayment of an assessment levied in violation of the charter and bylaws of the society Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 Where Notice of Assessment Is Sent but Not ReceivedWhere the bylaws of a benefit association provide that failure to pay assess ments within thirty days from date of mailing notice of same to the address of the holder of a benefit certificate forfeits all rights under the benefit certificate such a failure to pay is fatal where a notice is sent but never received by the assured Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 Manner of Giving Notice of AssessmentsParties have the right to agree what notice shall be given of assessments and if their agreement be that notice may be given by mail it is sufficient to prove the mailing and its failure to reach the assured by reason of its miscarriage in the mail will not excuse the nonpayment of the assessment within the time prescribed Bac Ben Soc  381 2 May Ins  562 Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 256 Proof as to Giving of NoticeUnder the decision in Survick v Valley Mut Life Assn 2 Va Dec 254 it would seem that where the nonpayment of an assessment is relied upon by a benevolent associa tion to defeat an action to compel the reinstatement of or a recovery upon a benefit certificate the fact of the giving of notice in accord ance with the bylaws of the association must be alleged and proved affirmatively May 56

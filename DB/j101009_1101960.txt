BURROUGHS TRACTS OF INSURANCE TO IMPOSE CONDITIONS A FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH WHICH IS VESTED WITH A FORFEITURE OF ALL RIGHTS IN THE SOCIETY THERE IS SOME APPARENT DIVERSITY OF OPINION AMONG THE CASES AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT IS NECESSARY FOR THE SOCIETY TO GIVE NOTICE OR TAKE ANY FORMAL ACTION IN ORDER TO MAKE THE FORFEITURE EFFECTUAL BUT IT WILL BE FOUND WE THINK UPON A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE AUTHORITIES THAT THE DIFFERENCE REALLY GROWS OUT OF THE CONSTRUC TION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS OF THE PARTICULAR SOCIETY IF FOR INSTANCE THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY PROVIDE THAT THE NONPAYMENT OF AN ASSESSMENT CONTINUING FOR A SPECIAL TIME SHALL OPERATE IPSO FACTO TO DETERMINE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SOCIETY AND THE DELINQUENT MEMBER AND TO FORFEIT HIS RIGHTS AS SUCH MEMBER WE KNOW OF NO CASE IN WHICH THE POWER OF SUCH A SOCIETY TO MAKE AND ENFORCE SUCH A RULE HAS BEEN DENIED BUT WHERE IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS OF THE SO CIETY ANYTHING IS TO BE DONE ON THE PART OF THE SOCIETY ITSELF TO MAKE THE EXPULSION OF THE MEMBER COMPLETE TO TERMINATE HIS RIGHTS AND INTERESTS IN THE SOCIETY THE COURTS REQUIRE A STRICT COMPLIANCE WITH THE COURSE OF PROCEDURE

THE ONE PART AND THE OTHER THE CONCLUSION IS REACHED THAT IF BY THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY NONPAYMENT OF AN ASSESSMENT OPERATES AS A FORFEITURE TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE OF THE CONTRACT AND THE MEMBER MUST ELECT EVERY TIME HE IS CALLED UPON TO PAY AN ASSESSMENT EITHER TO PAY WITHIN THE STIPULATED TIME OR SUFFER 1908 4714 VIRGINIA ILAW REGISTER THE PENALTY OF LOSS OF MEMBERSHIP AND ITS BENEFITS BY NEGLECTING OR REFUSING TO PAY WITHIN THAT TIME    THE QUESTION IS ONE OF CONSTRUCTION AND WE GIVE IN A NOTE THE CASES NOT HERETO FORE CITED HOLDING THAT IPSO FACTO SUSPENSION RESULTED FROM NON PAYMENT AND ALSO THOSE HOLDING TO THE CONTRARY AN EXAMINA TION OF THESE DIVERSE AUTHORITIES WILL SHOW THAT IN EVERY CASE IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THAT THE FAILURE TO PAY DID NOT OPERATE A SUS PENSION IPSO FACTO THERE WAS SOMETHING IN A JUST CONSTRUCTION OF THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS WHICH SHOWED THAT AFFIRMATIVE AC TION ON THE PART OF THE SOCIETY WAS NECESSARY IN OTHER WORDS THAT IN ALL SUCH CASES THE NONPAYMENT OF THE DUES AND ASSESS MENTS DID NOT UNDER THE PARTICULAR CONSTITUTION OR BYLAWS OPER ATE IPSO FACTO AND BY ITS OWN FORCE TO TERMINATE MEMBERSHIP IN THE SOCIETY IN CONCLUDING THE DISCUSSION OF THIS BRANCH OF THE CASE WE SHALL REFER TO SECTION 289 OF NIBLACK ON BEN SOC 2D ED THE WHOLE OF THE SECTION IS PERTINENT BUT TOO LONG FOR QUOTATION IT IS IN PART AS FOLLOWS HOWEVER ABHORRENT IT MAY BE TO ALL REASON TO PERMIT THE EXPULSION OF A MEMBER WITLIOUT NOTICE AND HEARING OR OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD FOR AN ALLEGED VIOLATION OF HIS DUTY AS A CITIZEN OR A CORPORATOR AND NOTWITHSTANDING THE FACT THAT A BYLAW PROVIDING THAT ON SUCH CHARGES A MEMBER MAY BE EXPELLED BY THE VOTE OF THE SOCIETY IN HIS ABSENCE AND WITHOUT NOTICE IS ILLEGAL AND INVALID IT MAY BE LAID DOWN AS CERTAIN THAT FROM THE VERY NATURE OF THE PLAN OF MUTUAL ASSESSMENT INSURANCE IT IS PROPER FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT SOCIETIES TO PROVIDE THAT NONPAY MENT OF AN ASSESSMENT WITHINA SPECIFIED TIME AFTER NOTICE SHALL IPSO FACTO WORK A FORFEITURE OF THE INSURANCE AND AN EXPULSION OF THE DEFAULTING MEMBER IT IS TRUE THAT WHERE SUCH STRINGENT CLAUSES OF FORFEITURE ARE MALE A PART OF THE CONTRACT THEY ARE USUALLY ACCOMPANIED BY PROVISIONS FOR THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE DELINQUENT MEMBER UPON EQUITABLE TERMS BUT SUCH PROVISIONS ARE NOT NECESSARY TO THE VALIDITY OF THE TERMS OF FORFEITURE THESE SOCIETIES DEPEND EXCLUSIVELY UPON THE PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS TO MEET THEIR LOSSES AND EXPENSES AND ONLY BY THE PROMPT PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS BY THEIR MEMBERS CAN THEY MAINTAIN THEIR SOL VENCY AIND RESPONSIHILITY THE ONLY PRACTICAL WAY WHICH THEY HAVE OF ENFORCIFG PAYMENT OF THEIR ASSESSMENTS IS BY FORFEITING IN SURANCE CONTRACTS AND EXPELLING THE DELINQUENT MEMBERS FOR NON PAYMENT AND THIS POWER IS NECESSARY FOR THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH SOCIETIES TO HOLD THAT SPECIFIC NOTICE TO THE MEMBER MUST BE GIVEN OF THE TIME AND PLACE AT WHICH HE WILL BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER THE CHARGE OF HAVING FAILED TO PAY HIS ASSESMENT WITHIN THE

RIELY SPEAKING FOR THIS COURT SAID THE FORFEITURE OF A CER TIFICATE IN A BENEFIT SOCIETY IS NOT WAIVED BY THE FACT THAT THE FINAN CIAL REPORTER OF A SUBORDINATE LODGE IS IN THE HABIT OF RECEIVING PAYMENT OF ASSESSMENTS AFTER THE END OF THE MONTH FOR WHICH THEY ARE LEVIED AND WITHIN WHICH THEY ARE PAYABLE UNDER THE PENALTY OF SUSPENSION AND A FORFEITURE OF THE BENEFIT CERTIFICATE WHEN THERE IS

PROVIDED THAT IN DEFAULT OF SUCH PAYMENT THE MEMBER SHOULD STAND SUSPENDED AND PROHIBITED THE COLLECTOR OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL FROM RECEIVING AN ASSESSMENT AFTER THE DAY IT BECAME DUE NOR WAS IT ESTOPPED TO INSIST UPON SUCH SUSPENSION WHICH OCCURRED SOME DAYS BEFORE THE MEMBERS DEATH BECAUSE ON SOME PREVIOUS OCCASION HE HAD PAID AFTER THE CLOSE OF THE MONTH WHERE THAT FACT WAS NOT REPORTED TO

BURROUGHS CONSTITUTION AND LAWS OF THE SOCIETY IT HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE FOR A LONG TIME OF THE MEMBERS OF SUBORDINATE COUNCILS NOT TO PAY THEIR MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS UNTIL REQUIRED TO DO SO BY A COLLECTING OFFICER APPOINTED BY THE COUNCIL AND IT HAD BEEN THE PRACTICE OF ITS FINANCIAL SECRETARY TO RECEIVE THE MONEY SO PAID AFTER THE EX PIRATION OF 30 DAYS FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH AND NOT TO STATE IN HIS MONTHLY REPORT TO THE NATIONAL SECRETARY THE FACT THAT CERTAIN MEMBERS HAD PAID THEIR ASSESSMENTS AFTER THE TIME PRE SCRIBED BY LAW FOR PAYMENT HAD EXPIRED THE NATIONAL SECRETARY WITH KNOWLEDGE OF THIS PRACTICE CONTINUED TO ISSUE EACH REGU LAR MONTHLY ASSESSMENT AGAINST THE SUBORDINATE COUNCIL BASED UPON THE NUMBER OF INSURANCE MEMBERS OF THE COUNCIL AS THUS REPORTED TO HIM BY

OF THE MONTH AND THAT HE MIGHT LAWFULLY PAY THE SAME AFTER THE EX PIRATION OF THAT TIME SO LONG AS HE PAID WHEN REQUESTED SO TO DO BY THE PROPER OFFICER OF HIS COUNCIL AND ACTING ON THIS BELIEF HE DID NOT PAY THE ASSESSMENTS MENTIONED IN THE ANSWER WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH BUT DID PAY THE SAME AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF THAT TIME TO THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY OF HIS COUN CIL THE COURT IN ITS OPINION SAYS THE FOREGOING FACTS ARE ALLEGED IN THE REPLY AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF TESTING ITS LEGAL SUF FICIENCY ARE ADMITTED BY THE DEMURRER AND HELD THAT THE LAWS OF A FRATERNAL BENEFIT SOCIETY PROVIDING FOR A MONTHLY ASSESSMENT AGAINST EACH SUBORDINATE COUNCIL ON THE NUMBER OF ITS MEMBERS AS REPORTED MONTHLY PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH AND THAT EACH MEMBER OF A COUNCIL SHOULD PAY HIS REG ULAR MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE FIRST DAY OF EACH MONTH UNDER PENALTY OF IPSO FACTO SUSPENSION FOR FAILURE TO SO PAY THE PAYMENT BY THE TREASURER OF A SUBORDINATE COUNCIL OF THE MONTHLY ASSESSMENT IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF EACH MONTH WAS NOT A PAYMENT BY ANY MEMBER OF THE COUNCIL OF HIS INDIVIDUAL MONTHLY ASSESSMENT AND THAT THE FACT THAT A MEMBER BELIEVED THAT A VIOLATION OF THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY WAS JUSTIFIED DID NOT SAVE HIM FROM THE PENALTY OF SUSPENSION THAT A SUBORDINATE 1908 5314 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTIR COUNCIL COULD NOT WAIVE THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH A MEMBERS BENEFIT CERTIFICATE WAS ISSUED OR CHANGE THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS OF THE ORDER WITH RESPECT TO THE TIME OF PAYMENT OF MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS AND THAT THE OFFICERS OF THE SOCIETY IN DEALING WITH THE MEMBERS THEREOF WERE ACTING AS SPECIAL AGENTS UNDER A SPECIAL AUTHORITY THE LIMITS OF WHICH WERE KNOWN TO THE MEMBERS AND THEIR ACTS IN ALLOWING MEMBERS TO PAY ASSESSMENTS AFTER THE TIME FIXED DID NOT OPERATE EITHER BY WAY OF WAIVER OR ESTOPPEL TO PRE VENT THE SOCIETY FROM MAINTAINING A DEFENSE TO AN ACTION ON A BENEFIT CERTIFICATE BASED ON THE FAILURE OF THE MEMBER TO PAY A MONTHLY ASSESSMENT WITHIN THE TIME FIXED THAT THE FACT THAT A SUBORDI NATE COUNCIL ADOPTED A PRACTICE OF NOT REQUIRING ITS MEMBERS TO PAY THEIR MONTHLY ASSESSMENTS UNTIL REQUIRED TO DO SO BY A COL LECTING OFFICER APPOINTED BY THE COUNCIL AND THE FINANCIAL SECRE TARY RECEIVED THE MONEY SO PAID AFTER THE EXPIRATION OF 30 DAYS AFTER THE FIRST DAY OF THE MONTH DID NOT EFFECT A CHANGE IN THE LAWS OF THE SOCIETY WHICH UNDER ITS TERMS COULD ONLY BE CHANGED BY THE NATIONAL COUNCIL IT NEEDS NO COMMENT TO SHOW THAT THE CASE JUST CITED IS IM MEASURABLY STRONGER ON BEHALF OF THE BENEFICIARY THAN THE CASE UNDER CONSIDERATION SEE GRAND LODGE ANCIENT ORDER UNITED WORKMEN V CRESSEY 47 IL APP 616 IN BORGRAEFE V SUPREME LODGE ETC SUPRE IT WAS HELD THAT THE BENEFICIARIES OF A MEMBER OF A BENEVOLENT

AFTER IT HAD BEEN SUSPENDED FOR 30 DAYS THE OFFICER OF THE SUBORDINATE LODGE COULD NOT WAIVE THE REQUIREMENTS THAT A SUBORDINATE LODGE AND ITS OFFICERS HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO WAIVE ANY RULES OF THE GRAND LODGE WHICH RELATE TO THE SUBSTANCE OF A CONTRACT BETWEEN AN IN DIVIDUAL MEMBER AND THE GRAND LODGE MODERN WOODMEN OF AMERICA V TEVIS SUPRA IS AUTHORITY UPON THIS POINT ALSO IT APPEARS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF THE FINANCIAL SECRETARY IN THIS CASE THAT IN MAKING PAYMENTS TO THE NATIONAL COUNCIL HE DREW HIS WARRANT ON THE TREASURER OF THE LOCAL COUNCIL AGAINST THE IN SURANCE FUND SECTION 125 OF THE BYLAWS PROVIDES THAT NO MONEY SHALL BE PAID OR TRANSFERRED FROM THE TREASURY OF ANY COUN CIL EXCEPT SUCH MONEYS AS THE COUNCIL IS CALLED UPON TO REGULARLY PAY FOR ITS CURRENT EXPENSES AND AS

SUBSEQUENT TO A REGULAR MEETING AT WHICH NOTICE IN WRITING OF A RESOLUTION OR INTENTION TO PAY OR TRANSFER SUCH MONEY AND THE PURPOSES AND AMOUNT TO BE PAID OR TRANSFERRED SHALL HAVE BEEN GIVEN AND REGULARLY READ WHICH WOULD SEEM TO BE A SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESSED INHIBITION UPON THE LOCAL COUNCIL TO DO THE VERY THING WHICH IT DID DO IN THIS CASE WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT BY HIS FAILURE TO PAY HIS ASSESS MENTS AS PROVIDED BY THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS WILLIAM J BURROUGHS IPSO FACTO FORFEITED HIS MEMBERSHIP IN THE ORDER OF KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS THAT THE SUBORDINATE LOCAL COUNCIL IN UN DERTAKING TO MAKE GOOD THE DELINQUENCIES OF ITS MEMBERS BY ITS WARRANTS DRAWN BY ITS FINANCIAL SECRETARY AGAINST THE INSURANCE FUND WITHOUT COMPLYING WITH SECTION 125 OF THE BYLAWS ACTED WITHOUT AUTHORITY TLRAT

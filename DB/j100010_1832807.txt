powers not accompanied the territorial grants which have already been described those grants would have lain wholly within the domain of private law They would have been estates of land unusually large no doubt but nothiing more In cases where the governmental rights of proprietors were suspended or resigned into the hands of the crown they remained thereafter only private landlords But the fact that rights of government were bestowed with the land gives to the regulations concerning the latter a significance in constitutional history The proprietor was made thereby the political head of his province In fact the territory became a province by virtue of the rights and institutions of government existing in and connected therewith The existence and exercise of these rights made the income from the land of the province public revenue When that revenue was expended it was a public expenditure The bestowment of grants of land by the proprietor not only carried with it the obligation to pay quitrent but to take to him the oath of fidelity Had it been possible for a territorial nobility to develop in the American provinces its creation would have shown lhere as in Europe how the granting of land could have been utilized as a means of strengthening the gov ernment and checking the growth of democracy In the discussion of the corporation as a form of colonial govern ment it was necessary to dwell first and chiefly on the legislature The general court was the central feature of that organism for in that the freemen who were the grantees of power found their embodiment But with the proprietary province the case is different The king established that by delegating to the proprietor the right to exercise certain functions of the prerogative within the province It is true that the proprietary charters contained more hints con cerning the form of government which should obtain in the province IThe governmental rights of Baltimore were suspended in I690 and so remained till 1715 Those of Penn were in suspension during the years I693 and I694 The New Jersey proprietors seem never to have been in undisputed possession of rights of government After such rights as they claimed were in I702 surrendered to the crown they remained formally as well as really private landlords  3I 32 H L Osgood than did the charters of corporations but they were only hinits The existence of anl assembly alnd hence the enjoymenit of political rights by the colonlists was not in any of the charters guaranteed in specific and mandatory terms in one that of New York it wsas not mentioned The powers whiclh were definitely bestowed were executive in character the ordinanice power the power to appoint all officers to establish courts to puniish and pardoni to organiize a military force and defend the province to bestow titles of honior to found churclhes and present to livinigs These made the pro prietor the executive of the province and for the most part left it to him to determine howv and in what forms the governnmental powers which hie had received should be exercised That he did this alone without advice or apart from the social and political conditions of the problem is not claimed That in none of the provinces save New York was there or could there havc beeln mtuch delay in call ing an assembly is true l3ut in all cases the assembly was called by the proprietor and withoout such action of his it could not legally meet What control he had over its organization and work wlhen once in existence wVill appear in the sequel The fact here insisted uponl is that the bestownment of power Uponl an inldividual instead of a corporationi assembled in geneiral court and its trans missioni throughl him to the colonists made the executive instead of the legislature the centre from and around which development in the province chiefly occurred It gave to the proprietor an im portance especially at the outset which was analogous to that enjoyed by the general court in the corporate colony It made him in a derived and inferior sense the source within the province of office and honor the fountain of justice the commanider of the military the recipient of the provinicial reveniue the constituent part of the legislature These were the jila rcMralia of the pro prietor wvlhich made his positionl that of a count palatinie They

obtained permanent form and development Marylanid was founided prior to the Restorationl wlhile all the rest were established subsequcnit to that event The Calverts and the Duke of York were the only proprietors whlo did not issue elaborate concessions as to govcrniment As we have seen they all publislhed the terms on wvlich they wvould grant land the Carolina and New Jersey proprietors and Pennl made similar announcement of the conditionis unldler whliclh government should be administered With one exceptionthe Fundanmelntal ConstitutionisThe Proprietary Province 33 of Shaftesbury and Lockethese documents have a decidedly modern form and purport They were apparently issued for the purpose of attracting settlers and may have contained features which were suggested by those who expected to live as colonists under them They approach as near formal compacts as is possi ble in the case of documents within the domain of public law One cannot imagine a medieval count palatine issuing to his vassals such grants as these In them the organs of the government which it was proposed to establish and their powers were described in some cases very minutely while provisions for amendment were included They were in fact octroi constitutions and were issued as an expression of the will of the proprietor but also with a view to the interests and demands of those who under new and strange conditions were to inhabit the provinces In these constitutions then we note the first significant innovation in matters of govern ment which occurred when the palatinates were reproduced in the American colonies The Calverts and the Duke of York by re fraining from their issue kept more strictly in the line of precedent and on that account for a time at least they were able better to control the dispensing and the exercise of political power They conceded less at the outset than did the proprietors of Carolina New Jersey and Pennsylvania As the proprietors themselves were the most important agents in these initial transactions their views and habits must be taken into account in judging the events themselves A study of the documents reveals the fact that the affairs particularly of Mary land and New York were guided by men whose minds were trained in the law and traditions of English administration The proprie tors of these provinces were men of this class Hence with them there was an adherence to legal forms a steadiness and precision in the conduct of business which the records of the other proprie tary provinces do not reveal The Baltimore family while in con trol seems to have devoted its attention more carefully and con tinuously to the administration of its province than did any of the other proprietary grantees The attention of the leading Carolina proprietors was diverted from their colonial interests by cares of state while especially after the death of Shaftesbury the fact that there were eight of them instead of one detracted greatly from their efficiency But they had no ideals which were inconsistent with the traditional monarchical system as reproduced in the province The same cannot be said of Penn and of the members of the pro prietary boards of East and West Jersey Penn was not a lawyer neither was he a specially able administrator The proprietors of VOL III334 H L Osgood the Jerseys particularly of West Jersey became very numerous and many of them settled in their provinces There as in Penn sylvania Quakerism and various other forms of religious dissent entered as elements which strengthened democratic tendencies among the people Dissenters were also numerous in the Caro linas and at one time Puritans made considerable trouble for Balti more But in Pennsylvania the first proprietor was himself a Quaker the entire board of West Jersey was of that persuasion while the sect was strongly represented among the grantees of East Jersey The social position the training the spirit the religious beliefs of the Quaker did not conspicuously fit him for maintaining the traditional forms of provincial government When he became a proprietor there was likelihood that the provincial system would be modified at its very source that institutions would be thrown as it were into solution and seem more ready than elsewhere to assume the democratic form In the Quaker provinces proprietors and people more nearly agreed in their ideals than they did else where Penn to his cost relied more on personal influence than he did on institutions as a means of retaining control over his province In the Jerseys moreover the difficulties of maintaining the proprietary system were vastly increased by the number of proprietors and by the doubt which hung over their claim to gov ernmental power Their history shows how it was possible by weakening and obscuring the executive to change this form of gov ernment into that of the commonwealth Thus it appears that in the domain of government the proprietary provinces had each its individuality and that this was in part due to the character and position of the proprietor It is believed that Maryland approaches the nearest of all to the model and so its history may chiefly be relied upon to illustrate the features of the system The effective exercise of governmental power by the proprietor began with the appointment of the governor It was mainly through this official that the powers of the proprietor were exercised in the province He was the proprietors commissioner or to use a term of private law his agent for all purposes of government Power was transmitted to him by a commission and he was guided in the use of it by instructions Instructions might be given him at the time of his appointment or also at any later period The letters written by the proprietor to his governor were of the nature though not in the form of instructions The governor in return was ex pected to report his doings to his superior and keep him informed concerning affairs in the province The governor like all other officials held office at the proprietors pleasure and was in no reThe Proprietary Province 35 spect legally independent of him There was no department or phase of his activity wherein he was not legally subject to the con trol of the proprietor though at the same time it is true that such control was often loosely exercised In order then to the existence of proprietary government it was not necessary that the proprietor should reside in the province Wherever the governor was there was the proprietor The governor brought the proprietor into the province for every public act of the governor if legally performed was done in the name and by the authority of his superior Any thing which the proprietor could lawfully do he could require his governor to do and at the outset the proprietor was limited only by the very general though in the sphere of private rights the comprehensive terms of his charter In the provincial system then provision was made for instructions before it was made for legislation and it was only through instructions that legislation could legally begin and be continued Instructions were as normal and regular a part of the system as was lawmaking Not only were they sent to the governor but when necessary to all other officials appointed by the proprietor Any official in the province might send them to his subordinate That this is a true account of the legal relations existing be tween the governor and the proprietor might be proved by citations at great length from the records of all the provinces The first governors of Maryland and Pennsylvania were appointed before any of the colonists left England2 and Lord Baltimore then gave to his appointee full instructions concerning the voyage and the making of the first settlement We know that in i 6643 a commission and instructions were sent to William Drummond the first governor of Albemarle County in Carolina though the documents have been lost The commission of Sir John Yeamans the first governor of Clarendon county is extant4 It is accompanied by instructions concerning the granting of land in which it is specified that the powers should be exercised in the name of the proprietor and ac cording to conditions and instructions proceeding from him The instructions sent to the governors of the proprietary provinces are not so voluminous as those sent by the crown to its governors they are also less comprehensive and much less exact in form The usage of no two provinces was the same and in the same province it varied from time to time The instructions issued by the Caro lina proprietors were usually brief but those sent in i69 i to Philip l Md Arch Council I636 to I667 pp 14I 149 i6I 2 Cavert Papers I 13I Hazard Annals of Pennsylvania 503 3 N C

proprietors or at least if they did so the documents have not been preserved But as members of the proprietors family often acted as governors it may be believed that directions were given by letter when elsewhere they would assume formal shape But examples of early instructionis in Maryland his tory lhave been preserved2 and after i66o the number wlhich appear in the records increases Though in Maryland as in other propri etary provinces more attention was paid in the instructions to terri torial than to governmental affairs there was no sphere of gov ernment whiclh they did not or might not touch They dealt in particular with the calling of assemblies and witlh the right of botlh governor and proprietor to assent to laws The history of this feature of Pennsylvania government reveals

April 15 I637 we finid them stated at length2 The military element in the office was placed first The governor vas made lieutenantgeneral This is the title by which in early times he wvas most often desig inated in the official documenits both of Marylanid and Carolina H4e was also adimiral and by virtue of these powers was organizer and commander of the forces of the province both by land and sea for purposes of defense Among the civil powers of the governor that of clhancellor raniked first 13y virtue of this he was keeper of the seal anid issued all grants both of land and office licenses writs of election judicial writs proclamations As chancellor also he was provincial judge in equity and in this capacity sat with the council The appointing power was closely connected with the office of chaincellor The governor was also chief justice and chief magis trate The first of these titles slhows that he was the commonlaw judge in the province exercising the combined powers of the Kings Benclh Commoni Pleas and Exclhequer He was expressly em powered to hear pronounce judgment anid award execution upon all causes criminal and civil and to do it as authoritatively as if the proprietor were present When life member or freehold were involved the councillors should sit as judges with him The title of chief magistrate referred apparently to the functions of the gov erinor as conservator of the peace and general executive of the province From him acting in these capacities proceeded the power of arresting detainiing and binding over offenders whiclh in the 1A4gchdvs Council I667 to i688 p 39 2 Arhives Council I636 to i667 p 49 This was really an ordinance of govern nment for it contained commissions for governor council and secretary as well as direc tions for

execute ordinances pardon criminals establish ports harbors markets and fairs to care for the initerests of the province and control its admiinistration in gen eral supplementing in all needful ways the work done under the otlher functions so as to make a rounded whole By virtue of his power as chief magistrate the governor also became the constituelnt part of the legislature It follows from this that within the province the governor was the centre from which proceeded all military judicial and administrative functions and also to a large extent legislative activity From no measure of importance even in the ecclesiastical sphere was his hand or influence absent All this the governor did as the commissioner and representative of the pro prietor in the province His official statuts was derived not from the province but from the proprietor He was lhead of the province by virtue of hiis being interinediary betweeni it anid the proprietor Wlhat the documents show to lhave been his position in Maryland they also show though somewlhat less elaborately to have beeln his place in the other proprietary provinces But at the same time that the office of governor was created provision was made in the proprietary commissions and conicessions for a council which should stand toward the executive in a relation analogous to that occupied by the privy council toward the king in England By the commission of I637 the governor of Mlaryland wvas commanded to advise with it  as lhe Slhall See cause upon all occations concernincr the good of our Said Province anid of the people tlhere That it was associated with the governor in the discharge of the highest judicial functiolns we have seen The councillors oath like that of the governor bound him to bear true faith to the proprietor and defend his rights maintain the peace and welfare of the people assist in the admiinistration of justice give good advice to the proprietor and his governor and keep secret the affairs of state According to this oath then the council was a branch of the executive and as such was under obligation to uplhold the rights of the proprietor In I 642 the council received for the first time a commission distinct from that of the governor2 In this it was called  Or privie Councell within Or said Province of Maryland and its members were empowered to meet with the governor when anid where he should direct  to treate consult deliberate and ad vise of all matters courses and things wch shall be discovered unto 1 Arcives Assembly I637 to I664 p 44 Council I636 to I667 p 85 2Arciives Council

regulating the people there as for the good and safety of Or said Province of Maryland The peculiar function of the council then was to advise the governor and through him the proprietor and in the provinces it was generally true that without that advice the executive should not act The judicial powers of the council were also discharged in connection with the governor and were provided for in his commission One would thus infer that as the council could not perform an executive act apart from the governor or an official representing him so the councillors possessed of themselves no judicial status above that of justices of the peace in their locali ties And yet the council very greatly increased the strength of the executive because of the political and social influence which it contributed while its utilization as a part of the legislature was of still greater advantage Through it the influence of the appointing power was made much more effective than it could have been if the governor had been left unsupported The Carolina proprietors and Berkeley and Carteret in New Jersey availed themselves of this support but Penn until I70I neglected it and made express pro vision instead for an elective council2 His experience with this will appear in the sequel but it was apparently of such a nature as to convince even the Quaker proprietor that an appointive council was a necessary part of the provincial system However when he se cured it in permanent form it was shorn of its direct legislative power The governor and council constituted the most important part of the official system of the province The custom of accumula ting offices in the hands of councillors or to state it otherwise of admitting officials to the council tended greatly to concentrate power in their hands The other officials whom the proprietor di rectly appointed were usually the secretary surveyorgeneral and receivergeneral3 In Carolina after the attempt to procure the ac ceptance of the Fundamental Constitutions began each proprietor was expected to appoint a deputy to reside in the province and rep resent him there These became a part of the council In that I Archives Council I636

blank commissions2 seem to have been sent over to be used in the appointment of sheriffs justices of the peace commanders of Kent Island or of the counties constables coroners and in the early time for military officers These were issued and countersigned by the governor In later times military officers seem to have been commissioned directly by the governor3 The governor however was authorized when occasion demanded to appoint any civil or military officer and also to suspend officials and appoint their suc cessors4 Over the selection of all officials he had great influence for the proprietor had to rely largely upon him to suggest the names of suitable candidates In I663 the Carolina proprietors influenced it would seem by the arguments of the New Englanders and of adventurers from the Barbadoes who were petitioning for a grant at Cape Fear proposed that the settlers should present a list of double the number of names required from which the governor and councillors should be se lected also that the governors term of office should be three years5 But this did not become a permanent feature of the Caro lina system The concessions of i665 provided for the appoint ment of the lieutenantgeneral by the proprietors Both governor and councillors moreover held during the pleasure of the pro prietors while the latter expressly reserved the appointment of the secretary and

certain specified offices but to appoint all other officials deemed necessary for the administration of the governimelt but for wlhom no provision had been made by the proprietors or commissions already issued That the tenure of office in North Carolina remained unchlanged till the close of the proprietary can be shown from published documents2 and if the manuscript records of South Carolina are ever printed mnuch more abundant evidenlce to the same effect may be expected That in New York during the proprietary period the officials were wlholly appointive and were exclusively controlled by the pro prietor and those who exercised the appointing power under him is susceptible not only of documentary proof but it follows from the fact that no assembly existed in that province till near the close of its proprietary period and the few measures which it passed affected the official system in no important respect But we find in Pennsylvania especially during the earlier period of its existence the system in vogue of filling offices by that combi nationi of election and appointment which the Carolina proprietors seem at the outset to have beenl tempted to adopt In his first Frame of Government whliich was issued in I682 Penn declared that as the affairs of the province must be quickly ordered and settled lhe wsould appoinlt judges treasurers masters of the rolls sheriffs justices of the peace and coroners to hold during good be lhavior But the method of filling these offices for wlhiclh provision Nwas made both in the first Frame and in the one issued the next year was this that the council should present double the number necessary to fill the higher offices and the assembly in the same proportioln for the lower offices and from these lists the governor should appoint the proper number in each case3 Offices seem to have been filled in this way save during the in terruption occasioned by Fletchers governorship till I700 and I70I Then judges and justices of the peace became by law directly appointive and if ve are to trust the implication of the Charter of Privileges only sheriffs coroners and county clerks continued to be chosen according to the old method and that for short terms4 In West Jersey the provincial system was in regard 1iNC Cz ss I 376 21bid 705 II 9 33 I29 I75 2I7 249 264 489 497 503 5I5 569 6o6 607 3P7 Co Recs I 35 45 This method

Concessions of I677 not only was the legislature given the power to choose the council men who should administer the affairs of government when the assembly was not in session but also the commissioners of public seals treasurers chief justices and collectors1 Justices of the peace and constables wvere to be chosen by the people presumably in the localities In November I68I it wvas enacted as a funda mental  by the legislature of West Jersey that all officers of state or trust in the province should be nominated and elected by the general assembly or under its regulations and that these officers should be accountable to the assembly or to such as it should ap point2 The acceptanice of this and of several other fundamentals was made the condition of the recognition by the assembly of Samuel Jennlings the appointee of the proprietor Edward Byllinge as deputygovernor ln I683 Jennings was actually elected gov ernor3 though in the Concessions there was no provision that he should either be recognized or elected The records show that as long as proprietary government lasted in West Jersey the general assembly continued to elect nearly all of the officials of the prov

sheriffs constables for the respective tenthst In I683 after the East Jersey proprietors had reached the number of twentyfour a  fundamenltal constitution  was issued for that province which provided that manly of the officials both of the province and of the localities should be elected But this  constitution  never went into effect6 and therefore in East Jersey the system of appointment which had been established by the first proprietors remained sub stantially unchanged In that province unlike West Jersey the resident proprietors never became so numerous as to constitute even approximately a majority of the voters and hence even had it been desired the democratizing of the province wvas a task of much greater difficulty By showinlg thus that the proprietor was the

toward an explanation of the nature of the provin cial system of government But it may be still further illustrated by considering that the proprietor was potentially the immediate source of honor as well as of office If its feudal nature were to be preserved intact the existence within the province of a nobility would be a matter of great importance In all the charters granted by the crowin to proprietors except that of Pennsylvania authority was given to bestow titles of nobility Neither Gorges nor Balti more attempted to exercise this power thoughl there are indications that the latter for a time contemplated something of the sort The Carolina proprietors in order the better to secure their official and aristocratic interests vith equality and without confusion gave the plan for a nobility a permanent place in their Fundamental Con stitutions The character and fate of this plan are too well known to demand extended notice here It failed by Reason of the want of Landgcraves and Cassiques and that was due to the fact that these titles were wortlhless in Europe and that in the colonies at that time there was neitlher population nor wealth sufficient to form the basis of a nobility Just lhere there appears witlh great clearnless the process of levelling to wlvich the palatinate was even at the outset subjected wlhen it was reproduced on this continent In some respects the governmental maclhinery of the province was far superior to that of the palatinate and more higihly developed but it was in those features whiclh fitted it for modern and semi popular uses The monarchical features of the palatinate or of the kingdom could be reproduced in the province because they are con sistenlt witlh society of a democratic type But an aristocracy both as a form of society and as a system of government is inconsistent with modern colonial conditions But though the proprietors found it impossible to create a no bility and the Quaker proprietors would have repelled the sugges tion that they desired such a thing the governmenital institutions of the province were established by them and that mainly tlhrough the exercise of the ordinance power This was done in accordanlce with their charter rights and was closely connected with the exer cise of the appointing power It remains nlow to be seen how on the basis of an official system which in the normal province was the creation of the proprietor the judicial military and legislative institutions in a colony of this type originated As we have seen the highest court in the proprietary province in the early stages of its history was created by the appointment of the governor and council This is true both of Maryland and44 H L Osovod of Carolina The Provincial Court of Maryland apparently con sisted of the governor and council until I692 Then it seems that the two bodies became distinct though leading men of the prov ilnce frequenltly sat as members of both In North Carolina the earliest extanlt records show that the general court consisted of the deputygoverlor the deputies of the proprietors and at least one assistant or associate This was in I694 The court appears in this form in i6952 But in October 1702 it apparenltly begins to act under a commission distinct from that of the council or the proprietors deputies Then its commission was published and the oath of office was taken by three judges3 In Marclh 1703 two other judges took the oath We have no furtlher records of the court till March l7I3 and thenl the bench consisted of a chief justice anld associate justices The chief justice was appointed by the proprietors and at least durinlg and after Governor Edens ad mniniistrationl he appointed the associate judges4 In Pennsylvania the provinlcial court became differentiated from the council almost imnmediately In 1684 an act was passed whiclh provided that five judges should be appointed by the governor any three of whom should constitute this court Twice yearly they

as a distinct body because the council was elective or whether the proprietor and early settlers of Pennsylvania were seeking in this case a closer imi tation of English usage than usually obtained in the colonies at the outset the province never abandoned the principle of the act of i684 Tlhere was much subsequent legislation and no little con troversy over the establishlmenlt of courts both with the home gov ernment and between the governor and assembly as in the other provinces also the governor and council in early times continued occasionally to discharge judicial functions but Pennsylvania ad hered from the outset to a judiciary which should be as distinict as possible both from the legislature and from the executive Of the lower courts in the proprietary province those of the man ors may be disregarded because they played a part of no impor tance in the American judicial system So far hoxvever as they ex isted they were the creations of the executive and not of the

Proprieary Provinice 45 for governmental purposestowns hundreds and countiesthe last were by far the most important and may here be taken to illustrate the point in view1 For the establishment of a county two acts were essential and decisive the fixing of its bounlds and the creation of the county court In the early history of the proprietary prov ince the fixingT of the bounds of counties was the work of the pro prietor and was done through his governor the council and the officers connected with the territorial administration With that side of proprietary activity it was closely allied In Maryland St Marys County at first comprised all the settled part of the province Its bounds were generally defined by the formation of outlying counties Of the order of i650 fixing the bounds of Charles County and that of I654 repealing the above ordinance and erect ing and bounding Calvert County the record has been preserved2 The orders for the erection of Somerset County and for the at tempted erection of Worcester County on Delaware Bay are ex ceptionally detailed3 The records of the origin of the other Mary lalnd counties whiclh were created by prerogative in the seventeenth century do not appear But the more importanit act was the creation of the county courts In most cases the proprietor began the establishment of these by the appointmeint of their officers In January i638 Jolhn Lewger was appointed conservator or justice of the peace within St Marys County4 James Baldridge was at the same time appointed sheriff and coroner Thus the officials whose presence was neces sary to the existence of a county court wvere in being but for some years at the outset the governor and council seem to have acted as the court of St Marys County December 30 1637 Capt George Evelyin was appointed by the governor as commander of Kent Is laind with the criminal and police jurisdiction of a justice of the peace and civil jurisdiction in cases involving 10 or less5 Prob ably on account of the remoteness of Kent Island and the difficul ties with Clayborne the commander was authorized to appoint all officers inecessary for the preservation of the peace and administra tion

fit till the Fundamental Constitutions could be put into operation Ludwell in I69I was instructed with the consent of three of the proprietors deputies to appoint a judge and four justices to try cases in any of the counties which had fifty freeholders qualified to serve on juries2 In I692 the assembly of South Carolina admitted that the power to erect courts belonged to the proprietors though the claim was made that it should be regulated by law3 The extant records of the court of Perquimanis Precinct apparently the earliest records of a counity court whiclh have preserved in North Carolina begin in 1693 4 11 I733 Governor Burrington had a controversy with two members of the council about the right to erect precincts and was able to show that save in the case of one precinct formed in 1722 all had been erected without the cooperation of the legislature By an act of I 71 5 the legislature recognized as legal units of representa tion the precincts which down to that time had been established by ordinance5 The records indicate that in botlh the Jerseys the proprietors in establishincg counties and courts acted mainly througlh the legisla ture but in New York Yorkshire

transferred to him the Delaware region At the same time in addition to Chester Philadelphia and Bucks counties wxere established in Peninsylvania This all was done before the first assembly of

gave the privilege already referred to of nominating double the number of candidates for justices and other court officers from which lists the governor made appointments In this way the earliest county courts in Pennsylvania were brought into existence by the exercise of the ordinance power and in harmony with Eng lish custom But legislation regulating the jurisdiction of these and the otlher

his governor commander of the forces by land and sea All officers military and civil whose duties might contribute toward the work of defence were commanded to obey him In the commis sions particularly those of Carolina the military powers of the gov ernor stood in the forefront and he was empowered to resort to all measures which were necessary for defence As Pennsylvania however developed no militia system till compelled to do so by the ravages of the enemy during the last intercolonial war she can in this connection safely be left out of account Of provisions for de fence in the Jerseys while under the proprietors traces are very faint Their protected position combined with other causes to di vert attention from such measures and cause them to seem unnec essary But Maryland Carolina and New York provided for de fence according to characteristic proprietary methods In them all military officers were appointed and commissioned by the governor The system of training was under his direction and when expedi tions were fitted out he gave orders directions and instructions both before and after the troops had set out upon the march In Mary land he occasionally commanded in person The enforcement of the assize of arms was ultimately a duty of his as was the procur ing of supplies of all kinds and the keeping of a magazine The work of building repairing and garrisoning forts also devolved upon him The subordinate officers in Maryland through whom the gov ernor acted were in early times the captain of the band of St Marys the captain of the band of Kent Island the commanders of the counties From time to time commanders were appointed for special expeditions against either the Indians or the various enemies of the province internal and external Thomas Cornwallis was re peatedly summoned2 to such a duty as this When after i66o the raids of the Five Nations against the southern tribes became fre quent expeditions had several times to be organized to restore quiet in the northern part of the province The soldiers for these were raised by draft upon those liable to military service in the counties3 In I658 by order of the governor and council captains were ap pointed to command and train the militia in various specified sec tions of the province4 We presently find that the trained bands of St Marys County were already formed into a regiment under a colonel5 This probably was the beginning of the organization of the entire militia system with the county as a unit The office of I Md Archives Council I636 to I667 pp 75 86 88

prevail before the institution of royal government in Maryland the authorities do not clearly reveal That it had not done so in New York at the close of the proprietary period is shown by the statement of Andros in I678 that the militia then consisted of companies for the most part with less than one hundred men each2 The system of training and service by companies for which provision was made in the Dukes Laws was not materially changed till after the permanent establishment of counties in New York Of the militia system in Carolina during the proprietary period save the general fact of the extent of the governors legal control we get no satisfactory information in the extant records In the development of government war and finance are always closely connected and largely through this connection has the leg islature been able to win its position of leadership The history of Maryland furnishes an illustration of this The heaviest expenses of its government were incurred in its military expeditions The right to raise all revenue which did not accrue in the form of rents alienation fines and fees belonged to the general assembly It early made use of this right as a means of limiting and regulating the exercise of the proprietors powers in the domain of military af fairs In I650 a law was passed3 providing that freemen should not be compelled to serve outside the province and that martial law should be enforced only within a camp or garrison In i66i an act was passed prescribing the quota which should be raised from each county for a prospective expedition against the Indians and the wages of the officers and soldiers4 The governor and council were empowered to raise the amount which was necessary by a polltax according to the custom of the province If it was deemed necessary they might also during the recess of the assem bly raise additional forces In I6765 a very comprehensive act was passed which prescnrbed the settled policy of the province in reference to training the raising of supplies for war the amount of wages which should be paid the providing of pensions for the dis abled and the impressing of provisions The act explicitly de fined the mode of raising the revenue which should be required and provided that certain members of the assembly should see that it was expended for the purpose designated Regularly from the lIbid 2I5 409

revenue had been appropriated for the proprietors use but this act shows perhaps better than any other which was passed during the early period how the taxgranting body by availing it self of financial needs created by war could effectively limit tlle ex ercise of the prerogative It has now been shown so far as space and published records will allow that the proprietor was in the full legal sense the official and administrative head of the province In the Fundamental Con stitutions of Carolina his executive powers were distributed among a board of eight so that each should hold one of the great offices of state and a court should result which should be a reflection of the English court as it was in the later Middle Age or during the period of the Tudors The powers which in the case of Carolina were analyzed and distributed in this way were in the other pro prietary provinces with the exception of New Jersey centered in the hands of an individual The proprietor of Maryland for ex ample was his own admiral constable chancellor chamberlain chief justice high steward and treasurer and exercised these powers either in person or by delegation An obligation to obey the proprietor as the one in whom these powers met rested then upon the inhabitants of the province and it was briefly and authori tatively stated in the oath of fidelity As we have seen the taking of this oath was one of the conditions of the socage tenure It was required in the corporate colony though the rent which was the other condition of the tenurc was not mentioned in the landgrants The influence of tenure in the colony of that type may be said to have vanished and the oath as there taken to have implied a purely political obligation Pro vision for it was made by an act of the general court and in Massachusetts for example the oath bound the freeman to obey and support the government of the commonwealth not to plot any evil against it but instead to reveal to the proper authorities plans of this nature as soon as their existence should be known In giving his vote the freeman promised to seek conscientiously the public weal without respect of persons or fear of any man The only difference between the oath of the resident and that of the free man2 consisted in the omission from the former of this last provision But in the oath of fidelity as imposed in the proprietary province appears the element of personal fealty which was so characteristic of the feudal relation Moreover it was due to the proprietor as of I The statement of Sir Ferdinando Gorges in the Briefe Narration concerning his planis for the government of his province furnishes another illustration in point Baxter Gores and the Province of Mai me II 66 2 7ss Recs I I15 II7Thze Proprielary

the absolute lords and proprietors and to defend and maintain their royal juris diction and dominion over the land and people of the province as granted in the charter His territorial rights were also recognized by the engagement not to receive or purchase any lands in the province from thoseeven Indianswho did not derive their title to them from the proprietor and to hold them only  to the use of the said Lord or Proprietor The personal element in the oath appears very clearly in the form prescribed in I648  I do Swrear that I will bear true faith unto his Lordship and to his heirs as the true

law was actually passed which affixed the penalty of death forfeiture of goods and corruption of blood to the crimes which were menltioned in the bill of I639 but they were no longer expressly termed treason As soon as the influence of the Puritans who settled at Anniapolis appears in the affairs of the province we find them protesting against the words  absolute lord and  royal jurisdiction  in the oath as  far too high for a subject to exact and too much unsuitable to the present liberty which God had given the English subjects from arbitrary and popish govern ment Therefore from the oath which was prescribed in I650 by a legislature in wlhich the Puritan element was strong the objection able phlrases were omitted and the words  just and lawful intro duced to signify the kind of

counicillors assemblymen all officials of the province and all who would receive grants of land or enjoy political rights should take not onily the oath of allegiance to the king but that of fidelity to themselves2 The latter required that they should be faithful to the proprietors promote the peace and welfare of the province and discharge witlh fidelity the trusts imposed upon them Those who could not swear should subscribe and the subscription should be as binidinig as the oatlh But the proprietors of Carolina never wenit to the extreme of claiming or countenancing the idea that the crime of treason could be committed against them Conspiracy anid rebellioni against their government they interpreted to be trea son against the king3 This was tlhe attitude assumed by all pro prietors subsequent to the Restoration The requirements of the Carolina proprietors were reproduced in New Jersey and in a procla mation issued in i668 to the inhabitants of Middletown and Shrews bury tlhey were forbidden to vote or hold office witlhout takinig the oaths4 That a similar oath was administered in New York there is abundant evidence5 In Pennsylvania again the situationi was pecu liar because of the number and influence of the Quakers But even there it was enacted by the assembly at Chester in December I682 that all officeholders in the province and all who had the right to choose or be chosen members of the assembly should subscribe a declaration of fidelity to the proprietor his heirs and assigns and should not  consent to nor conceal any person or tling whatsoever to the breach of this solemn engagement This was afterwards placed among the  fundamental laws which like the Frames of Government could be amended or repealed onily bythe consent of the proprietor and of

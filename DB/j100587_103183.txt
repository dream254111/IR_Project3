C CHEPSTOW IN MONMOUTHSHIRE MAY 13 1697 SINCE MY COMING FROM OXFORD I SPENT 3 OR 4 DAYS IN THE COALPITS OF THE FOREST OF DEAN WHERE I FOUND I THINK ALL YOUR CAPILLARIES BESIDES SOME OTHER NEW PLANTS THREE OR FOUR WHEREOF ARE HERE FIGURED TOGETHER WITH TWO SPECIES OF ASTROPODIUM GATHERD ON THE SEVERN SHOAR THE ONLY RARITIES OF THE KIND I SUP POSE THAT HAVE BEEN DISCOVERD I DOUBT NOT BUT AS YOU SAY THE COAL PLANTS HAVE BEEN OBSERVED BY THE WORKMEN LONG SINCE THO THEY ESCAPED THE NOTICE OF NATURALISTS WHO TILL THIS LAST CENTNRY CONTENTED THEM SELVES WITH BARE READING AND SCRIBLING PAPER I FIND IT WELL KNOWN TO ALL OUR COUNTRY COLLIERS BY THE NAME OF CARREG REDYNOG I E THE FERNY STONE AND ONE MR WIL LIAMS ARCHDEACON OF CARDIGAN WHO IS A PERSON VERY CURIOUS AND INGENIOUS TOLD ME HE HAD OBSERVED MUCH FINER PATTERNS 25 YEARS SINCE IN THE COAL PITS OF GLAMOR GANSHIRE THAN SOME THAT I SHEWED HIM THE WHOLE BRAKEN THAT KIRKMAN MENTIONED WAS A NOBLE CURIOSITY WE SAW NONE SUCH IN THE FOREST THO WE FOUND THEM MUCH LARGER THAN THOSE YOU SENT THE STALKS OF FERN AND HARTSTONGUE I THINK WE OFTEN MET WITH BUT CANNOT SAY WE SAW ANY ROOTS INDEED I KNOW NOT WELL WHE THERTAB 1 PHILOSOPH TRANSACT NO 337

LYCOPODIJ CUJUSDAM RAMULUS NARBERTH PEMBROKSHIRE JUNE 19 1698 I HAVE BEEN VERY INQUISITIVE ABOUT COYNS OF THE PRINCES OF WALES SINCE I BEGAN THIS UNDERTAKING BUT COULD NEVER SEE ONE OF THEM THO THE BISHOP OF BANGER WHO IS VERY WELL SKILLD IN BRITISH ANTIQUITIES TOLD ME A RE LATION OF HIS KEPT ONE OF LHYWELYN AB IORWERTH WHO WAS COTEMPORARY WITH RICHARD I AND K JOHN IN HIS POCKET SEVERAL YEARS AND SHEWED IT MANY OF THE BISHOPS AC QUAINTANCE STILL LIVING WHO CONFIRM IT BY THE PRINCES OF WALES I UNDERSTAND THE BRITISH PRINCES FROM K KAD WALADR ABOUT THE YEAR 600 TO THE LAST PRINCE LHEWELYN AP GRUFFYDH ABOUT THE YEAR 1280 I HAVE FOUND SEVERAL OF THE MORE ANCIENT BRITISH COYNS WHEREOF YOU SEE DI VERS FIGURES IN CAMDEN MY FRIEND MR NICHOLSON QUOTES CAESAR FOR THE BRITONS HAVING NO COYNS WHEREAS ON THE CONTRARY CAESARS WORDSARE NUMMO UTUNTUR PARVO ET AENEO NOR CAN I SEE ANY REASON TO DOUBT OF BRITISH COYNS OF ALL SORTS OF METAL TILL HE OR SOME OTHER INFORM WHOSE COYNS THOSE ARE WHICH MR CAMDEN AND OTHER WRITERS TAKE TO BE BRITISH THE96 THE DRUID BEADS ARE GENERALLY GLASS SINCE THE LAST EDITION OF CAMDEN I HAVE MEET WITH 2 OR 3 OF THEM THAT HAD A SNAKE MANIFESTLY PAINTED ROUND THEM SO THAT I TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THE OVA ANGUINA OF THE BRITISH DRUIDS WERE THESE GLASS BEADS THO THOSE OF THE GAULISH WERE THE SHELLS OF THE ECHINI ORBICULATI LATICLAVIJ HAY IN BRECON SEPT 19 1698 WE SEARCHED THIS SUMMER THE HIGH MOUNTAIN BY BRECNOCK CALLED Y VANN UWCH DENI BUT FOUND NOTHING IN IT NEW NOR ANY GREAT VARIETY OF RARE PLANTS THE MOST CHOICE WERE SEDUM ALPINUM ERICOIDES IN ABUN DANCE ARGEMONE LUTEA RHODIA RADIX MUSCUS CUPRES SIFORMIS AND ABOUT HALF A DOZEN MORE OF THE COMMON SNOWDON PLANTS LYSIMACHIA CHAMAENERION DICTA IS A COM MON PLANT BY THE NAME OF LHYSIER MILWR I E HERBA MILITARIS IN THE MEADOWS THROUGH ALL THE UPPER PARTS OF THIS COUNTY WE ALSO MET WITH SORBUS LEGITIMA AND SORBUS TORMINALIS GROWN TO AS GREAT A HEIGHT AS THE OR NUS NEITHER OF WHICH HAD EVER OCCURD BEFORE IN WALES BUT OF ALL THESE TOPICAL PLANTS I WAS SURPRISED AT NONE SO MUCH AS THE CAPILLUS VENERIS VERUS GROWING VERY PLEN TIFULLY OUT OF A MARLY INCRUSTATION BOTH AT BARRY ISLAND AND PORTH KIRIG IN GLAMORGANSHIRE AND OUT OF NO OTHER MATTER AND ALSO THAT GNAPHALIUM MAJUS AMERICANUM SHOULD GROW ON THE BANKS OF RYMNY RIVER WHICH RUNS ALTOGETHER OVER IRON STONE FOR THE SPACE OF AT LEAST 12 MILES BEGINNING NEAR THE FOUNTAINHEAD IN A MOUNTAIN OF THIS COUNTY AND YET NOT A PLANT OF IT TO BE SEEN ALTOGETHER THROUGHOUT WALES IN A GREAT LAKE CALLED LHYN SAVADHAN I FOUND A PELLUCID PLANT I HAD NEVER MET WITH BEFORE THE LEAVES ARE EXTRAORDINARY THIN AND TRANSPARENT IN FORM NOT UNLIKE SMALL DOCK LEAVES BUT THE MIDDLE RIB IS CONTINUED BEYOND THE EXTREMITY SO THAT97 THAT EACH LEAF HAS A SOFT PRICKLE AT THE END BY WHICH NOTE I HOPE YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT IT IS WE FOUND THERE ALSO THE HIPPURIS SAXEA AND TWO ELEGANT SORTS OF SMALL LEECHES WHICH I SUPPOSE NOT DESCRIBD THE LIMESTONE OF THIS COUNTY AFFORDS SMALL GLOSSOPETRAE AND SILIQUASTRA BUT THEY ARE BUT VERY SCARCE IN COMPA RISON OF THE QUANTITY FOUND IN OXFORDSHIRE NORTHAMPTON SHIRE BERKS C THE MOST CONSIDERABLE RARITIES IT AFFORDS ARE FAYRIE CAUSWAYS WHICH I CALL SO IN IMITATION OF THEIR GIANTS CAUSWAY IN IRELAND SI LICEAT MAGNIS COMPONERE PARVA FOR WHEREAS THEIR MAY BE HALF A MILE LONG OURS SELDOM EXCEED 3 FOOT OUR LIME QUARRIES YIELD TWO OR THREE BODIES CONGENEROUS WITH IT THO OF A VERY DIFFERENT FORM AND PERHAPS ALL MAY BE REFERABLE TO THE CORAL LINE CLASSE WHICH IS THE SECOND IN MY CATALOGUE T A B I FIG 7 A GREEN ADDERS BEAD ADORND WITH SNAKES SKELETONS OF A CITRINE COLOUR FIG 8 A BLACK ADDERS BEAD ADORND WITH 9 SMALL SNAKES OR CORNUA AMMONIS OF A WHITISH BLEW FIG 9 AN ADDERS BEAD RESEMBLING CHERRYTREE GUM ADORND WITH A SNAKE CHEQUERD OF BLEW AND WHITE LINLITHGOW IN SCOTLAND DECEMB 17 1699 IN THIS KINGDOM OUR TRAVELS IN THE HIGHLANDS WERE THROUGH CANTIRE ARGYLE AND LORN BESIDE THE ISLES OF MAC Y CHORMIE MUL AND Y COLUMB KIL AND IN THE LOWLANDS THROUGH GLASGOW STERLING AND EDENBROUGH IN THE HIGHLANDS WE FOUND THE PEOPLE EVERY WHERE CIVIL ENOUGH AND HAD DOUBTLESS SPED BETTER AS TO OUR ENQUIRIES HAD WE HAD THE LANGUAGE MORE PERFECT WE MET INFERREDWITHINFERRED SEVERAL INSCRIPTIONS BUT NONE OF THEM ROMAN NOR INDEED ANCIENT HOWEVER WE COPIED ALL WE MET OF TWO HUNDRED YEARS STANDING C FOR THE O SAKE98 SAKE OF THE ORTHOGRAPHY OF THE IRISH NAMES WHICH ARE WRIT DIFFERENTLY FROM WHAT IS NOW USUAL WE ALSO TOOK FIGURES OF SOME VARIETY OF THEIR BROACHES OR SILVER AND BRASS FIBULAE USED BY THE WOMEN TO CLASP THEIR KOLERIV A GARMENT ANSWERING OUR NIGHTRAILS BUT WHAT WE WERE MOST DIVERTED WITH WAS THEIR VARIETY OF AMULETS MANY OF WHICH IF NOT ALL WERE CERTAINLY USED BY THE DRUIDS AND SO HAVE BEEN HAND ED DOWN FROM PARENTS TO CHILDREN EVER SINCE SOME OF THESE MAY BE RENDERD IN ENGLISH 1 SNAKEBUTTON 2 COCK KNEE STONE 3 TOADSTONE 4 SNAILSTONE 5 MOLE STONE 6 SHOWERSTONE AND 7 ELFARROW 1 THE SNAKEBUTTON IS THE SAME DESCRIBED IN THE NOTES ON DENBIGHSHIRE IN CAMDEN BY THE NAME OF ADDERBEADS BUT THERE ARE OF THESE GREAT VARIETY AS TO COLOUR AND ORNAMENT INSOMUCH THAT BETWIXT WALES AND THE HIGH LANDS I HAVE SEEN AT LEAST FIFTY DIFFERENCES OF THEM IN IRELAND THOUGH THEY ARE TENACIOUS ENOUGH OF ALL OLD CUSTOMS I COULD HEAR NOTHING OF THEM SO I CONCLUDE THAT EITHER THE IRISH HAD NO DRUIDS OR THAT THEIR WANT OF SNAKES FRUSTRATED THEIR ADVANCING THAT IMPOSTURE A MONGST THE PEOPLE BUT THERE WERE BUT A FEW PLACES WHERE WE INQUIRED AND PERHAPS WE MAY HEREAFTER HEAR OF THEM IN OTHER PARTS OF THAT KINGDOM NOT ONLY THE VULGAR BUT EVEN GENTLEMEN OF GOOD EDUCATION THROUGHOUT ALL SCOTLAND ARE FULLY PERSWADED THE SNAKES MAKE THEM THOUGH THEY ARE AS PLAIN GLASS AS ANY IN A BOTTLE 2 THE COCKKNEE STONE IS AN ECHINITES PILEATUS MINOR OF FLINT WHICH THEY FIRMLY BELIEVE TO BE SOMETIMES FOUND IN THE KNEES OF OLD COCK AND A FELLOW IN MUL PROTESTED TO ME THOUGH I WAS NEVER THE NEARER BELIEV ING HIM THAT HE HAD WITH HIS OWN HANDS TAKEN ONE OF THEM OUT OF A COCKS KNEE AND NAMED TWO OR THREE OTHERS WHO HAD DONE THE LIKE 3 THE99 3 THE TOADSTONE IS SOME PEBLE REMARKABLE FOR ITS SHAPE AND SOMETIMES VARIETY OF COLOURS THIS IS PRE SUMED TO PREVENT THE BURNING OF A HOUSE AND THE SINK ING OF A BOAT AND IF A COMMANDER IN THE FIELD HAS ONE OF THEM ABOUT HIM HE WILL EITHER BE SURE TO WIN THE DAY OR ALL HIS MEN SHALL FAIRLY DYE ON THE SPOT 4 THE SNAILSTONE IS A SMALL HOLLOW CILINDER OF BLUE GLASS COMPOSED OF FOUR OR FIVE ANNULETS SO THAT AS TO FORM AND SIZE IT RESEMBLES A MIDLING ENTROCHUS THIS AMONGST OTHERS OF ITS MYSTERIOUS VIRTUES CURES SORE EYES 5 THE MOLESTONES ARE RINGS OF BLUE GLASS ANNULATED AS THE AFORESAID SNAIL STONES 6 THEY HAVE THE OMBRIAE PELLUCIDAE WHICH ARE CRYSTAL BALLS OR HEMISPHERES OR DEPRESSED OVALS IN GREAT E STEEM FOR CURING OF CATTLE AND SOME ON MAY DAY PUT THEM INTO A TUB OF WATER AND BESPRINKLE ALL THEIR CATTLE WITH THAT WATER TO PREVENT BEING ELFSTRUCK BEWITCHD C AND 7 AS TO THIS ELFSTRICKING THEIR OPINION IS THAT THE FAIRIES HAVING NOT MUCH POWER THEMSELVES TO HURT A NIMAL BODIES DO SOMETIMES CARRY AWAY MEN IN THE AIR AND FURNISHING THEM WITH BOWS AND ARROWS EMPLOY THEM TO SHOOT MEN CATTLE C I DOUBT NOT BUT YOU HAVE OFTEN SEEN OF THOSE ARROWHEADS THEY ASCRIBE TO ELFS OR FAIRIES THEY ARE JUST THE SAME CHIPD FLINTS THE NATIVES OF NEW ENGLAND HEAD THEIR ARROWS WITH AT THIS DAY AND THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL STONE HATCHETS FOUND IN THIS KINGDOM NOT UNLIKE THOSE OF THE AMERICANS I NEVER HEARD OF THESE ARROWHEADS NOR HATCHETS IN WALES AND THEREFORE WOULD INFERREDGLIDLYINFERRED BE INFORMED WHETHER YOU HAVE EVER HEARD OF THEIR BEING FOUND IN ENGLAND THESE ELF ARROWHEADS HAVE NOT BEEN USED AS AMULETS ABOVE THIRTY OR FORTY YEARS BUT THE USE OF THE REST IS IMME MORIAL WHENCE I GATHER THEY WERE NOT INVENTED FOR O  CHARMS100 CHARMS BUT WERE ONCE USED IN SHOOTING HERE AS THEY ARE STILL IN AMERICA THE MOST CURIOUS AS WELL AS THE VULGAR THROUGHOUT THIS COUNTRY ARE SATISFIED THEY OFTEN DROP OUT OF THE AIR BEING SHOT BY FAIRIES AND RELATE MANY INSTANCES OF IT BUT FOR MY PART I MUST CRAVE LEAVE TO SUSPEND MY FAITH UNTILL I SEE ONE OF THEM DESCEND NEAR GLASCOW WE FOUND TWO FOSSILS TOTO GENERE NEW ONE RESEMBLING SMALL JOYNTS OF A LOBSTERS ARM BUT MUCH LONGER THE OTHER SOMEWHAT LIKE LARGE GLOSSOPETRAE OR PERHAPS LIKE THE MUCRO OF A PINNA MARINA THESE FIGURD STONES ARE FOUND THERE IN AN IRON STONE THOUGH I NEVER SAW THEM IN THAT KIND OF MATTER IN WALES WE FOUND BOTH SHELLS AND ENTROCHI GONE OFF TO THAT SUB STANCE HAVING CHANGED THEIR MATTER AND MUCH OF THEIR SHAPE NEAR THE SAME TOWN SEARCHING FOR THESE FOSSILS I FOUND IN THE MIDST OF THE LIMESTONE SOME COCHLITAE COM POSD OF FLINT BUT CONCHITAE OF SPAR GONE OFF SO FAR FROM THE SHAPE OF SHELLS AS HARDLY TO BE KNOWN WERE IT NOT FROM OTHERS IN THE SAME PLACE RETAINING THEIR SHAPE MORE ENTIRELY THE PRINCIPAL OF THE COLLEGE SHEWD US STONES HE HAD LATELY PROCURED FOR THE LIBRARY HAVING ROMAN INSCRIP TIONS THESE WE COPIED AND SEVERAL OTHERS ELSEWHERE OF THE SAME DATE WHEREOF SOME ARE PRINTED IN CAMDEN THO NOT VERY CORRECTLY AND OTHERS NOT YET PUBLISHD THEY KEEP THESE STONES AT GLASCOW VERY CAREFULLY IN THE LIBRARY AND THE PRINCIPAL WAS DAILY EXPECTING TWO OR THREE MORE THAT HAD BEEN PROMISED HIM MR SOUTHERLAND GAVE ME SPECIMENS OF THE CHAMAEPERI CLYMENUM ADIANTHUM ACROSTICON AND PYROLA ALSINES FLORE EUROPAEA I HAD NOTHING FOR HIM IN EXCHANGE BUT SAM PLES OF THE VITIS IDAEA INFERREDFOLIJSINFERRED MYRTINIS CRISPIS MERETTI TO GETHER WITH SOME OF THE BERRIES THIS I FOUND PLENTI FULLY FOR SOME MILES TOGETHER IN THAT  AND OF MUL NEXT101 NEXT TO EY COLUMB KIL TIS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON VITIS IDAEA SEMPERVIRENS FRUCTU RUBRO BEING A LAR GER PLANT MUCH MORE BRANCHED THE LEAVES OF A CRIPSD SURFACE AND THE BERRIES WHICH AS THEY TOLD ME IT RETAINS ALL THE YEAR LIKER UNTO THOSE OF HOLLY GOING UP ONE OF THE HIGH HILLS OF MUL WE FOUND RHODIA RADIX PES CATI COTYLEDON HIRSUT VACCINIA RUBRA SEDUM ALP TRIFIDO FOLIO AND WHICH I HAD NEVER SEEN GROW SPONTANEOUSLY AL CHIMILLA ALPINA QUINQUEFOLIA WE FOUND IN THIS ISLAND A CURIOUS FUCUS ARBOREUS WITH A RUFFLD STALK WHEREOF WE TOOK A FIGURE

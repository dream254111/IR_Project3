onions the latter part of May and the writer collected two specimens about a month later In each of the above instances asparagus was growing near winter onions The great similarity of the asparagus rust Puccinid asparagi and the onion rust P porri together with the results obtained by inocula tion and the secidia recently collected on the onion is very suggestive of the identity of the two rusts But Klebahn has been able to inoculate several species of Allium including A cepa with Melampsora producing a Cceoma in each case so that it appears that the Alliums are very susceptible to the attack of the rusts when inoculated The writer is conducting experiments along the same line with other liliaceous plants but as yet results are not ready for publication Inoculations of a number of species of Dianthus and Gypsophila with the uredospores of the carnation rust Uromyces caryophylli nus Sch Schroet have given the same gen eral results so far as the effect of temperature sunlight and susceptibility is concerned as was obtained for the asparagus It has been demonstrated that the carnation rust is local instead of being distributed through the plant and that certain varieties are practically immune There is often associated with both the asparagus and carnation rusts another fungus Darluca filum Cast thought to be parasitic on the rust Some observations have led the writer to conclude that it is not parasitic on the rust and that it is not so beneficial as is generally supposed Its saprophytic tenden cies have been demonstrated by growing it on various culture media both animal and vegetable including bouillongelatine and bouillonagar asparagusagar potato canned asparagus stems etc On some media it pro duced pycnidia in three to five days Spores from pure cultures when inoculated on rusted asparagus gave the characteristic pycnidia with the curled masses of spores issuing from  Klebahn Zeitschrift fiir Pflanzenkrank heiten 12 1 17 1902 237 them Only negative results have as yet been obtained on the stems of living asparagus although it flourishes on the cooked stems and there are strong indications that it may be parasitic on asparagus A complete account of the work will be published later JOHN L SHELDON THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA LINCOLN CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN GERMANY IN 1901 RECENTLY published statistics of the chem ical industry in Germany for the year 1901 show that it has shared in the general busi ness depression of the Empire though the results are less unsatisfactory than in other branches of manufacture Among the reasons assigned for the depres sion are a tendency toward overproduction the increased cost of raw materials the high price of coal and of labor and proposed changes in the tariffs on many articles which enter into chemical manufacture It is also pointed out that in the United States in Russia and in several other countries there is a growing in terest in this branch The following figures show the imports and exports for the years 1900 and 1901 The articles included are the more important drugs pharmaceutical supplies and dyestuffi or materials entering into the manufacture of the same Imports Ex ports Year Quantity

exports for the year 1901 over the preceding year the cost of raw materials and of labor has left manufacturers but small returns for their in vestments Statistics of dividends paid by concerns en gaged in this branch of manufacture during the year 1901 are not yet fully announced but  Consular Report from H W Harris Mann heim AUGUST 8 1902238 SCIENCE it is claimed that they will not differ greatly from those of the preceding year when they showed a falling off One hundred and twenty one stock companies having a combined capi tal of about 83000000 paid in 1900 an average dividend of 1233 per cent as against 1332 per cent in 1899 Nineteen companies paid no dividends in 1900 20 paid less than 5 per cent As will appear from the following figures the gain in imports in 1901 was marked in

The German manufacturer of chemicals is dependent upon foreign countries for most of his raw product and for an outlet for his goods he is also hampered by the high price of fuel and freights and he realizes that his main reliance is the supply of trained chem ists in Germany A summary of the statistics of this industry in the United States taken from the recently published census returns has been published somewhat widely in Ger many and the certainty of vigorous and in N S VOL XVI No 397 creasing competition on the part of the United States in this important branch is admitted SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS WE have noted that four men of science Lord Kelvin Lord Lister Lord Rayleigh and Sir William Hugginshave been included in the new order of merit founded by King Ed ward at the time of his expected coronation Attention should further be called to the fact that in addition to these four men of science there are in the order three generals two ad mirals two men of letters and one artist Science consequently appears to be in advance of any other department in the number of those selected as especially noteworthy and to represent one third of the most eminent men excluding statesmen in Great Britain IT is said that Captain Willard Herbert Brownson now commanding the battleship Alabama has been selected as superintendent of the Naval Academy at Annapolis to assume his duties in October Captain C H Davis superintendent of the Naval Observatory will it is understood succeed Captain Brownson in command of the Alabama DESPATCHES from Germany report that Pro fessor Virchow has had another fall and is very seriously ill A TITLE of nobility has been conferred on the Asiatic explorer Dr Sven Hedin MR GIFFORD PINOHOT chief of the Bureau of Forestry is at present in Minnesota con ducting experiments on reforestation He will later go to the Philippine Islands to pre pare a report on the forest conditions DR WHITMAN CROSS of the U S Geological Survey will spend

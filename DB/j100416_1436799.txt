however the dentition does not conform closely to that indicated in the typedescription a single tooth is de veloped at the tip of the tongue as in attenuatus the teeth of the jaws are not stronger than in the other Californian species the vomerine and palatine teeth form a subcontinuous series as in 0 thaleichthys In its distinctive features starksi appears to be rather in variably intermediate between thaleichthys and attenu atus All these facts suggest the possibility that starksi may be a nominal species based on hybrids CARL L HUBBS University of Michigan A PREOCCUPIED NAME IN Hyla In 1912 I described a Hyla monticola Mem M C Z 40 1912 p 127 pl 1 fig 2 from Washan in Szechuan a mountain near the Tibetan frontier I notice now that Cope Jour Acad Nat Sci Phila N S 8 1875 1876p 106 made use of the name monticola for a socalled subspecies of Hyla punctari ola Peters from Costa Rica As this name may in time be forced into use as a full specific designation it is necessary to rename the Chinese form It may therefore be called Hyla bambusicola T BARBOUR Cambridge Mass AN EARLY RECORD FOR THE OVIPOSI TION AND HATCHING OF THE MILK SNAKE During the night of July first a milk snake Lampro peltis triangulum triangulum Lacepede donated to the American Museum by Mr R Blaschke laid eleven eggs The snake which had been recently se cured at Cold SpringonHudson was confined during the day in an ordinary wooden cage and on the morn COPEIA 98ing of July second it was found resting upon but not encircling the freshly laid eggs These eleven eggs were closely adherent all orientated in the same direc tion with their long axis perpendicular to the wooden floor They measured 32 34 34 34 35 35 35 36 37 38 and 38 millimeters respectively along their great est length After preserving the embryo from one of the eggs the remaining ten eggs were transferred to a filter pa per lined hollow in a small terrarium The earth in the terrarium was kept slightly moist during the fol lowing weeks and no direct sunlight was allowed to fall upon it On July eleventh another embryo was preserved On August eighteenth the first sign of hatching occurred in the appearance of a longitudinal slit about a centimeter long near the upper end of one of the eggs Examination of an adjacent egg disclosed a fully formed embryo but still possessing a yolk sack measuring roughly 22 x 15 x 12 millimeters No further sign of hatching was noted during the days immediately following On the morning of Septem ber second it was discovered that all the snakes had escaped from the eggs and had already shed their skins The terrarium had not been closely watched from August thirtieth to September first inclusive and it is very probable that the hatching occurred during this interval I know of no other record for the hatch ing of the milk snake in August No decided increase in the size of the eggs was noticed as development proceeded The empty shells of the eight eggs remaining September second measured along their long axis 31 33 33 335 34 34 35 and 35 mm respectively The embryos developed rapidly The specimen pre served on July second measured 8 mm in greatest length as it lay coiled upon the yolk Its head was 35 mm long The specimen preserved July eleventh had a length when in its embryonic coiled position of 115 mm while its head measured 55 mm The em COPBIA 99bryo killed August eighteenth was practically fully developed It measured 231 mm when extended The eight specimens preserved on September second measured 241 mm minimum to 254 maximum 2492 mm average in total length The adult fe male measured 1010 mm The series of nine young including the embryo pre served August eighteenth does no show much varia tion in scutellation They all possess as their parent 21 dorsal rows of scales in the middle of the body The gastrosteges and urosteges of the parent number 19843 Only two of the young are females Their formulae for the ventral scales are 20150 and 20248 respectively The seven young males have the follow ing formulae 18751 19850 19552 19451 19450 20052 and 19850 average 1951511 G K NOBLE New York N Y A PARTLY SPOTTED KING SNAKE Lampropeltis getulus On October 13 1920 while we were on a tramp to Neuse River near Raleigh N C my friend Mr Franklin Sherman picked up a small King Snake about two feet long and handed it to me As it was rather unusual in its markings from the ordinary run of the species which is common here I give below a brief description Black above with narrow crossbands or roundish spots of white as followsa white cross bar across the nape behind this an oblique white cross bar run ning back from right to left then eight roundish white spots on the right and seven on the left side these rep resenting the bases of the lacking crossbands and al ternating not opposite one another then four diago nal crossbars from left to right followed by two spots 100 COPEIA

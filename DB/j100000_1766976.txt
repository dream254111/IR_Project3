selected from a flock of thiltyfive At the same tirne ten chickens hatched from the same hens mated with a Plymcuth Rock cock wer3 sirnilarly chosen The chickens were about six sveeks old healthy ar3d vigorous and of nearly the same size Up to the time of pur chase both hens and chickens had full run of the farm The hens foraged for themselves and were given no food The chickens had been fed cornrneal dough sour rnilk and table scraps A preliminarv feedingtrial was continlLed for tswentyfive days 1uring svhich time both hens and chickems were contineS all to gether in a fairly well lighted and ventilated roorn and fed a areat variety of food in order that all should go into the feeding trial as nearly as possible in tle same condition During this prelirninary feeding leoth hens and chickens increased in live weightthe ten hens frolYl a total of 44 pounds 12 ounces to 47 pounds t 5 ounces or 375 ounces each laying 93 eggs the chick ens from a total of 9 pounds 15 ounces to 18 pounds or 129 ounces each Food shells and water were kept constantly betore the fowls Basins xYhich contained the foocl and water were kept within a bow constructed of lath so arranged thal the fowls could reach between the slats and procure food and drink without wasting or   solllng July 26 the hens and chickens were each separated into two ots of five each as follows hens nitrogenous ration weighed 23 pounds 85 ounces hens carbonaceous ration weighed 28 pounds 9 ounces chickens nitrogenous ration E eighed 8 pounds 15 ounces chickens carbonaceolls ration weighed 9 pounds t ounce The four lots were placed in separate pens where they re tnained during the entire e2iperiment w7hich lasted one hundred and twentyfive days They were fed cmd watered once daly and al1 account kept of the food eaten and water drank At each feeding the food and xTater remaining was weighed back and deducted from tbe amount charged t the previous feeding The hens and chickens fed a nitrogenous ration were given flaily all they would eat of the following mixtureonethird part wheatbran one third part wheatshorts onethird part cot tonseedmeal two parts skimmed milk and will be designated tos 1 The hens and chiokens fed a carbonaceous ration svere given daily all they would eat cf a ration of cracked maize and maize dough and will be designated Lot II Both groups were gis en a small arnoullt of green clover as long as it lasted and afterward cabbage For conxenience the experiment was divided into five periods of twentfive days Dliring the first period all the fowls seemed in good health ex cept the carbonaeeous fed chicks They during this as in all ucceeding periods X7ere restiess arld peevish always UlOping or bunting for sorllething to eat though their trough was filled Wllen fed they would greedily take a few Inouthfuls and then with their hunger still unappeased szould leave the dish They always ate ravenously the green food which was given them as did the hens and chickens of Lot I The hens of Lot II on the contrary seemetl quite willing to squat about the pen and subsist on the maize diet and strangely enough cared little for green food The clear maize diet was aceompanied by sueh ill effects that the chickens of each lot after the first period were gisen daily each onefourth ounce of wheat and the hens each one ounce The wheat was increased during the foulth and fifth pe riods in the case of the chickens to one ounce each During the second period one of the chickens fed nitrogenous food and during the third period another of the same lot were taken ill and removed from the experiment Both seemed to be suffering from impacted crops as the stomach and gi7zard in each ease were found to be empty 1 Condensed from a thesis prepared for the clegree of baohelor of science in agriculture ly James Edward Rice a graduato of the cass of 1890 of the Col lege of Agrioulture of Cornell University The fact that the sick cbicliens disliked the nitrogenous ratlon and that since the filst period the amount of food eaten by the hens and chickens of Lot I had continually decreased led to the belief that their food might te too nitrogenous and as during the last davs of the third period one of the hens in Lot I was also ill it was decided to discontinue the use of cottonseedmealt and to use linseedmeal instead The hen recovered soon after the change in food The supsly of skimmilk ruDning short in the last two periods water was used instead in mising the ration of the lots fed nitro genous food At the beginning cf the fifth period onehalf of the linseed meal in the ration of Lot 1 was removed and cottonseedmeal substituted This colubination seemed a happy orle for on this ration both hens and chickens made large gains At the end of the experiment little differellce cculd be seen in thehens of the tvPo groups but the two lots of chickens were in striking contrast hile the chickens fed on nitrogenous food were large plump healthy active and well feathered the chickens fd on a carbonaceous ration were in general uluch smaller sickly and in ses eral cases almost destitute cuf feathers Two of them had perfectly bare backs and so ravenous were they for flesh and blood that they began eating one another The inability of the chickens fed on a carbonaceous diet to throw out nes feathels and the ability of the chickens fed on a nitrogenous diet to grow an enormous coat of teathers is a splen did illustration of the effect of the composition of the food in supplying certain requirernents of animal growth It was plain to see that maize even when assisted by a small amount of wheat and green clover could not supply sllfficient nitrogen for the grovfth of feathers While both lots of hens lost sveight during the experiment the loss szas slihtly greater with those fed nitrogenous food but these produced by far the most eggs The chickens fed on nitrogenous food juet about doubled in weight wllile those fed on carbonaceous food only added about onethird to their weight During the first week the carbonaceous fed hens laid three eggs while the others laid two The two groups were tterefore practically evenly divided at the stalt as to the condition of the laying stage At the end of the first period the nitrogenous fed hens had laid fortythree eggs and the carbonaceous fed hens had laid twenty During tha next twentyfive days the fortner laid thirty and the latter si2i During the third period the for mer laid six and the latter not any From this time on no eggs were received from either group The decline in eggproduction was probably due in large part to the fact that the hens began to moult durirxg the second period and continued to do so dllring the rest of the esperiment The eggs laid by the nitrogenous fed hens were of small size having a disagreeable flavor and slnell watery albumen an espe cially small darkcolored yolk with a tender vitelline membralle which turned black after beingkept several weeks while the eggs of the carbonaceous fed hens stere large of fine flavor of natural smell large normal albumen an especially large rich yello yolk with strong vitelline mernbrane which vvas nerfectly preserved after being kept for weeke in the saxne brine with the other eggs Saxnples Of the eggs from each lot of fowls svere privately marked and sold to a boardinghouse where the cook did not know that the eggs were undergoing a test On meeting the cook seseral days later the following words were heard  Do you expect me to cook such eggs as these  About every other one is spoiled  On examination of the ovaries after slaughtering it was found that in the case of one of the carbonaceous fed hens the osules were in a more advanced stagse but on the whole the nitrogenous fed hens were much nearer the laying period With this single exception the cluster of ovules in the carbonaceous fed hens were uniformly small Neither group would have laid under any probahility for several weeks It would seem from these factsS together with the fact that during the experiment the nitroge206 nous fed hens laid rnore than thtee times as many eggs that a nitrogenous ration stimulates eggproduction On Nov 27 the fowls were slaughtered Each fowl was 7eighed wrapped in a bag to prevent floundering and killed by severing an artery in the roof of the lnouth The blood was caugbt in a glass jar The fowls were then picked and the feathers weighed after which the body was laid open longitudi nally by cutting alongside the sternum and through the back bone When all had been thus prepared they were hung up in groups to be photographed but the photographs were quite un satisfactory so far as shoring the relative proportions of fat and lean One half of each fowl was tested by cooking for fla Jor succu lence and tenderness the other half was carefully prepared for ehemical analysis by separating the tneat frorn the bones The flesh Bas thoroughly mixed and run through a sausagecutter mixed again and the process repeated three times From differ ent parts of this misture a large sample sas taltent from which the ehemist took his sampes for analysis The right tibia of each fowl was tested for strength by placing it across two parallel bars and suspending a wire on its eentre on which sz ere placed sulall weights until the bone gave way 0 Dressed Weqght

DIFFERENT BREEDS IN Bulletin No 69 of the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station Mr Eugene Davenport agriculturist of the station re marks that it has long been known that other influences than food caperated decidedly to aSect the gains of a feeding anizmal Ihe individual valiation is great often if not always easy to foresee but impossible to estimate hence tbe benefit of selection and every feeder knows that as much depends upon the selection of the bunch of feeders as upon their aftercare The question has arisen in the minds of men whether or notS by the various standards of selection employed in the establish ment of breeds anv importanl differences have resulted and whethel or not7 properly speakirg there are such things as brQed diSerences aside from form color etc and if so lt are their character atld extent  Are they sufficient to distinguish one breed above another  This question was made thc basis of two extended feeding ex periments by the Miehigan Station with steers of diSerent breeds The first is reported in full in Blllletin No 44 and the cecond forms the subject of Bulletin No 69 Though primarily conductecl as an experi ment lbetween the breedsv Mr Davenport prefers to present the records and data in dependent of that questlonto discuss it in other bearings as well and discover if possible what other circumstances may has7e exerted influences upon the gainss retaining till the lose of the discussin the question of the breeds The itlfluence of different kinds of feedstuffs has not entered into this experiment The idea has been to feed them alike using a Inixed grain diet and giving some Yariety both in grain and coarse fodder and to adjust the amount of botb at all times to the appetite of the individllal animal The rations of all the steers have been at all times precisely alike except as to amount ancl soule slight sZariations which they established tivemselves between grain and coarse fodder Every opportunity possible has been afforded regardless cf ex peclse for individual differences and breed peculiarities to ap pear Neither this nor any similar experiment is absoutely jllst to alll tbe breeds Thew conditions have been made alike for all except as to the amount of food each chose to take But like conditiolls cannot lbe taken as being equally favorable to all The framing of an experitnent vrhich sllould afford each its best conditions would include those so dissimilar as to make the restllts not capable of comparison Likely this is as Iwell as could be done though it certainly affords conditions xnore nearly natural to sone than tcy others Ihere is no doubt that if they had been kept in open yards9 with a higher proportion of coarse fodder the results wouldL have been greatly different both absolute3y and relatively The whole experiment may be taken as one ernIloying a heavy grain ration for tlle bunch consumed as many pounds of grain as of coatse sodder if the latter had been equally dry The plan was to secule as nearly typical specinlens of the breeds as possible Ibere srere originallv two each of the five breeds Gallovvay Hlstein Herefordl ShortHorn and Devon but acci dents deprived tlle station of one of the Short Horns axjd one of the Devons It is not thought that either breed suffered in the loss Jt is to be regretted but it is not always possible to carry ten animals for two years anel a half and all remain in every svay normal This is mentioned lest the experiment be criticised for furnishing only one specimen of these two breeds This loss is to be regretted for es7en the two is too small a number to estimate thesr personal equation and not till after that is done can anf7 diSerence in breeds be fully established Thegrain ration sas made up of corn and oats either whole or Live weight

of the fowls fed a nitirogenous ration svas darker colored more succulent more tender and better flavored though on this last there was some diSerence of opinion So far as it is warrantable to dram7 any conclusions from a sin gle experiment of this kind it would seem that chickens fed on an exclusive corn diet will not rnake a satisfactory developrllent particularly of feathers that the bones of chickens fed upon a nitrogenous ration are fifty per cent stronger than those fed upon a carbonaceous ration that hens fed on a nitrogenous ration lay many more eggs but of smaller size and psorer

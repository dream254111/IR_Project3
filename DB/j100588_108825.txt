Member of the Literary and Philosophical Societies of Manchester and Liverpool Received January 3Read January 23 1862 THE following memoir contains a complete solution of the problem of the classification and enumeration of the Pedra Qacra The actual construction of the solids is a task impracticable from its magnitude but it is here shown tlhat we can enumerate them with an accurate account of their symmetry to any values of P and Q Section first discusses fully the symmetry of polyedra and gives a sketch of the Tables which it is required to form for the solution of our problem viz Tables of the classified Pedra Qacra and Qedra Pacra and of their faces summits and edges symmetrical and unsymmetrical Section second proves that all these Tables are given if certain data are first obtained The rest of the memoir is occupied by the investigation and construction of these assigned data Section third contains the analysis of a polar or nmonozone summnit of a Pedron Qacron the deltotomous effaceables of the summit are defined and restored the reticulation which is laid bare by the removal of the rays of the summit is analysed and reduced Section fourth is devoted to the construction of polar and monozone retictulations and to their registration with their signatures of form and symmetry in groups which suffice for our problem Section fifth gives formulEe for the zoned and zoneless coronation of a polar or mono zone perfect reticulation whereby it becomes a polyedron and Tables of the perfect summits thus obtained are sketched out Section sixth enumerates and registers the results of deltotomous effacements about perfect summits that is summits about which all deltotomous effaceables have been restored or which have no effaced effaceables whereby the summit analysed in section third is obtained and registered Section seventh analyses the polar summits of a janal axis the rhombotomous efface ables of the opposite summits are defined and as well as their deltotomous ones restored about either pole the jancal reticulation laid bare by the removal of the summits is analysed and reduced Section eighth constructs ennmerates and registers with their signatures of symmetry the fundamental and primitive janal reticulations Section ninth contains the construction enumeration and registration of janal sbnub cleus reticulations Section tenth gives the like concerning janal nucleus reticulations MDCCCLXII R122 REV T P KIRKMAN ON THEE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA  I Section eleventh gives a similar account of perfect janal mixed reticulations Sections twelfth and thirteenth are devoted to the janal coronation of janal reticulations and to the enumeration and registration of perfect janal summits Sections fourteenth and fifteenth enumerate and register the results of deltotomous and rhombotomous effacements about perfect janal summits Section sixteenth analyses a polyarchipolar summit effaceables are restored about all like archipoles the polyarchaxine reticulation laid bare by the removal of these polar summits is reduced and afterwards constructed with enumeration and registration of results the formulhe for polyarchaxine coronation are given and the results of efface ment about the principal axes are enumerated and registered Section seventeenth gives the analysis construction and enumeration of contrajanal anaxie pairs of edges which have neither polar nor zoned symmetry but of which one edge is the reflected image of the other and diametrically opposed to it The rest of the memoir is devoted to the enumeration of plane reticulations i e par titioned polygons the knowvledge of which is taken for granted in all that precedes Section eighteenth enumerates and registers the symmetrical and asymmetric plane penesolids i e plane reticulations laid bare by the removal of an edge of a polyedron Sectioz nineteenth enumerates and registers the primary lane reticulations symmetric and asymmetric with their signatures of symmetry Section twentieth constructs enumerates and registers with their signatures the zoned plane reticzlations Section twentyfirst gives the like account of the zoneless plane reticulations It is unfortunate that my previous labours on the partitions of the Rgon that is on plane reticulations are of little utility for this problem of the polyedra by reason of their too great generality and of their not giving the nuImber of maryinal triangles in each partition Yet the fundamental theorem on the kdivisions of the Rgon has been the key to the greatest difficulty in this theory which is to find the number of the asymmetric plane reticulations which have a given marginal signature Of the two sections here presented to the public the first arts I XXXV is ilin itself a complete treatise on the symmetry and classification of Polyedra and the second together with the preceding introduction puts the reader clearly in possession of the main outline of the argument Much remains of the entire work which is however completely written and in the possession of the Royal Society as well as extensive applications of the method to the enumeration of polyedra These will be intelligible only when the general methods and formule of this memoir have been investigated and exhibited SECTION 1On the Symmetry of Polyedra I The symmetry of polyedra is 1 Zoned symmetry 2 Zoneless axial symmetry  Philosophical Transactions 1857 p 2251 IT REV T P IREMlrAN ON THE THEORY OP THE POLYEDRA 3 Mixed symmetry both zoned and zoneless axial 4 Neuter symmetry neither zoned nor zoneless axial 5 No symmetry The greater part of the polyedra are entirely asymmetric In considering this symmetry we have no regard to mere lengths or inclinations of edges The symmetry is descritive not metrical For example if the cutting edge of a wedge be removed by any quadrilateral section the solid acquires for our purposes all the symmetry of the cube and this remains however the figure may be distorted 1 Zoned Symmetry II The polyedra which have a zoned symmetry and only such are a Monozone polyedra b rmzoned monaxine heteroids c Zoned triaxines d mzoned monarchaxines having one principal and m secondary axes e Zoned polyarchaxines having the axial systems of the regular polyedra The terms will be explained below Def A zone is any closed line drazwn or drawable on a polyedron which divides it into halves either of which is the reflected image of the other no regard being had to mere lengths of edges The closed line may or may not be all in one plane and the halves may or may not be metrically equal We have a right to conceive when it is convenient that the solid is constructed with the greatest possible symmetry in which case the halves will be exactly equal and the zone will be a plane having to them the geometrical relation which a mirror has to an object touching it and to its image This relation we shall assume as always existing however the polyedron may be dis torted that is we assume that any zoneless edge will meet on any zonal plane if it be produced the edge which is its reflected image in respect of that zonal plane For example any section of a cube which passes through two opposite faces and con tains either two edges or none of the solid is a zone Every zone has a zonal signature Z which describes it by the numnber of its zoned features i e its zonal faces and its zonal summits through which it passes and its zonal and epizonal edges but gives no account of the number of edges in the zoned faces or summits nor of the order of the zoned features Any edge contained by the zone Z is a zonal edge of Z Any edge cut by the zone is an epizonal edge of Z It will create no confusion if we denote both the zone and its signature by the same name Z We represent zonal and epizonal edges by the symbols 0 and 0 zero faces and we write the number of such edges as an index over the proper symbol All such indices in a zonal signature are coecffients R 2 123REV T P KRIRMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA  1 IIIvr III a Monozone polyedraA monozone polyedron has no symmetry but that of a single zone It has the zonal signature Zg G a0 0 which records that Z has g zoned summits G zoned faces a zonal edges and b epizonal edges No two AA of the zoned features of a monozone polyedron have the same configuration or are one the reflected image of the other For if A were identical in configuration with A there would be a symmetry of repe tition not essential to the zone Z And if A were the reflected image of A there would be a zone different from Z passing between A and A Every zonleless feature B is twice read on a monozone polyedron viz B and its reflected image The undravwn lines of Z are the zonal traces of the zoned faces and summits The trace of a zone is agonal diagonal or monogonal according as it passes through one angle two angles or one angle only of the face or summit M2ionogonal traces are seen only in oddangled faces or summits A monozone 8edron 12acron is  whose zonal signature is Z220 01 0 IV Zoned axisAny number of zonal planes may have a common line or axis which is a zoned axis Def An axis is janal whether it be zoned or zoneless if the configuration C or if the reflected image of C which is read at one extremity of the axis can be read by an opposite eye at the other extremity by turning the axis through any angle In particular a janal zoned axis is said to be objanal when the configuration C read at onepole or extremity is the configuration C read at the other pole by an opposite eye in the axis turned through two right angles C being C inverted Also a janal zoneless axis is said to be contrajanal if the configuration C read at one pole is the reflected image of the configuration C which can be read by an opposite eye at the other Def An axis whether zoned or zoneless is heteroid if the configuration C read at one pole cannot be read at the other nor read inverted nor reflected V According to the character of the polar features terminating an axis zoned or zoneless the axis is amphiedral amjphigonal amphigrammic gonogrammic edrogrammic or gonoedral terms which explain themselves An axis is mzoned when it is the intersection of m zones A zoned amphigrammic edrogrammic or gonogrammic axis is of necessity twozoned for a polar edge may be zonal in one zone and epizonal in another but cannot belong to a third VI Theorem There are two different hemizonal sequences of configuration and only tzuo read alternately upon the hemizones about a zoned axis 124 1 VIIX REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA For 1 there cannot be fewer than two because if two contiguous hemizones had exactly the same configuration they would be each the reflected image of the other and therefore not contiguous but on opposite sides of a different zone And 2 there cannot be more than two for every hemizone A has on either hand by definition of a zone the same hemizone B and B has on either hand the same hemi zone A The propositions of the following article are easy deductions fiom the above theorem We use the term perpendicular in a wide sense in consideration of art II that is under the assumption of the greatest possible symmetry VII When there is an even number of zones about a zoned axis each is perpen dicular to another and has two identical hemizones If a 2mzoned axis is the only one of the solid there are two different entire zonal configurations about the axis viz m zones Z alternating with the m zones Z The signatures of Z and Z may or may not be different the configurations cannot be the same When there are 4m zones each is perpendicular to one of the same configuration When the number of zones is 4m2 each is perpendicular to one of a different con figuration When the number of zones is odd none is perpendicular to another When the axis is 2mnzoned there are in each polar feature mn traces t alternating with m traces t When the axis is 2mlzoned the polar face or summit has 2m1 identical traces About a 2mlzoned axis there is but one entire zonal configuration and conse quently but one signature for all the zones These zones have not each two identical hemizones Whether the r zones be odd or even the 2r semitraces present alternate configura tions in the circuit of the pole Each trace has two like terminations if r be even and two different terminations if r be odd VIII Theorem If a zoned axis is the only axis of the polyedron that axis is heteroid For if not the opposite poles will be either identical or one the reflected image of the other If they are identical there is an axis of even repetition perpendicular to the zoned axis i e an axis about which in revolution of the solid the same configuration is 2m times repeated to the eye which is contrary to hypothesis If they are one the reflected image of the other there is at right angles to the zoned axis a zone whoseintersections with those of the zoned axis are other axes of the solid which is contrary to hypothesis Wherefore the theorem is proved IX b Zoned monaxine heteroidsA polyedron whose only axis is an rnzoned axis is an mzoned monaxine heteroid polyedron 125REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA When m is odd the zonal signature is z g fpG Oa O where f2 shows the number p of polar summits andfp of polar faces beside g different nonpolar zonal summits G different nonpolar zonal faces a different nonpolar zonal edges and b different nonpolar epizonal edges The axis may be amphiedral amphigonal or gonoedral When m is even the two zonal signatures are Z 2g  fp2G O 0O2a 02b Zao2g f2G 0 O0 O2 02  where apG2 cG0 if m2 art V describes the poles which may give six different characters to the axis V one for every solution of the equation aofJ a 2 where a 2 differs not from 32 in form We consider two zoned features of which one is the reflected image of the other to be the same in configuration and enumerate the two as one in our Tables of zoned features The above signatures show g G a b and g G  b for the number of their different zoned nonpolar features For each zone has two identical hemizones when m is even but not when m is odd VII The polar edge which aP 0 is zonal or epizonal in Z is epizonal or zonal in Z There is nothing to prevent the two zones Z Z from having the same signature but they cannot have the same configuration And we always consider two zonal signatures which differ only in p subscribed and in the ways of writing the factors of the same number of features as numerically the same zonal signature This is important to be remembered when we inspect our Tables in considering the zone Z WVhether m be odd or even every different nonpolar feature is read 2m times on the solid namely once in each of 2m interzonal regions A 2zoned monaxine heteroid 6edron 8acron is    The zonal signatures are Z 21 21 OP 0  0 g  l 1 G  a0b Z 21 22 op0   O0 gl GI2 31 a0b The axis is amphigrammic A 3zoned

hexagon has three agonal traces X Principal zoned axis Secondary axesA principal axis has more zones or not fewer zones than any other The zones which intersect in it are principal zones Theorem If there be but one principal zoned axis A it is janal the solid has one and but one zone besides those of the axis and this zone is perpendicular to the axis A For Z a zone not containing the principal axis cannot divide the solid into halves of which one is the reflected image of the other unless the axis is janal and at right angles to Z As the axis can be perpendicular to but one zone the truth of the theo rem is evident This Z is called when m 2 the secondary zone of the polyedron and its intersec tions with the zones of the principal axis are the secondary zoned axes of the polyedron XI Theorem A 2mzoned princial axis has 2m 2zoned secondary axes all janal the 4m secondary poles ofthese aes are in the secondary zone of two alternate cofigtra tions and the alternate secondary axes are diferent The 2m axes are 2zoned being each the intersection of the secondary with a prin cipal zone The rest is evident if we make a section of the solid in its secondary zone  for the 2m traces of this section are the 2m aees VII Theorem A 2m1zoned princ ial axis has 2m1 secondary axes Their 4m2 secondary poles are in the secodary zone n the circ it of which they present two alter nate configurations The secondary axes are all 2zoned all alike and all heteroid XII d Zoned monarchaxinesA polyedron having only one principal mzoned axil is an mzoned monarchaexin janal polyedron which is also sufficiently described as an mzoned monarchaxine X where the number m does not include the secondary zone When nm2 no axis is principal and there are three 2zoned axes any one of which is perpendicular to the other two These three axes are of three different configura tions for if two semiaxes at right angles to each other were identical they would reflect each other and a zone would pass between them whence it would follow that the third axis were no 2zoned axis c The solid in this case is called a zoned triaxine polyedron It has three zones of different configurations The zonal signatures of a 2rzoned monarchaxine r  1 are thus written ZZ being principal zones and Z being secondary Z  2ap2g 2fJp2G P O 0 0 4b Z 2rp2g 2fQp2GO 04  0 3 0db Z7 2r 5p sp  2g   2 r Op a 0 2d where

r of either configuration XI The numbers gGab gGab record all the different zoned nonpolar features of Z and Z as gGcd record those of Z The secondary polar edges are zonal in one zone and epizonal in another Every nonpolar zoned feature of the r zones Z or f the r zones Z occurs four times in each zone Z or Z Every nonpolar zoned feature of Z occurs in it 4r times Thus all such features are read 4r times Every zonzeless feature of tthe solid is read in it 8r timnes in as many interzonal regions The principal axis is either amphiedral or amphigonal The characters of the secon dary axes all janal vary with the solutions of the equations enumerating their poles When r1 the solid is a zoned triaxine whose three signatures have one form and may or may not be identical signatures But the three configurations of the zones are always different The zonal signatures of a 2rlzoned monarchaxine are Z 2a5p2g 2fpp 2G O 02 02 0o6 Z2r1p2g p2G 0 O 02 0 2d0 where a f1 describes the principal pole and Sppap2 describes the secondary poles of different configurations Thus p2 gives an amphi gonal ccl1 gives a gonogrammic axis c Every nonpolar feature in the principal zone Z is read twice in the solid in each of the 2r1 zones Every nonpolar feature in tlhe secondary Z is read 4r2 times in Z Every zoneless feature of tlhe solid is read 8r4 times once in each of 8r4 interzonal regions A 2r4zoined monolarchaxine janall 22edron 36acron is here figured of which the zonal signatures are Z   2  04j 04117 5pgO bfppl GaaO Z21p41 21p 041 o efla  G  bo Z4 i21 1p 21 l gp c We see on inspection of these signatures that the principal axis is amphiedral because Z has four polar faces of which only two can be secondary poles We see that Z has four polar summits in the two zones Z and four polar faces in the two zones Z Hence the secondary axes are alternately amphigonal and amphiedral The two zones Z have each four nonpolar epizonal and no zonal edges The two zones Z have each four nonpolar zonal edges and no epizonals  1 XII1 XII XIII REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA The secondary zone has eight nonpolar zonal edges and no epizonals and it has eight nonpolar summits Hence we can subtract on inspection of the signatures all the zoned faces summits and edges from the entire number in the solid and thus determine the number of diferent zoneless features in each of the eight interzonal spaces A 3zoned monarchaxine 17edron 27acron is   of which the signatures are Z 121 211 021 021 Z31P21 l 02 We read in these signatures that the principal axis is amphiedral because Z has four polar features of which two faces must be principal poles because the principal axis is janal Either zone shows that the secondary axis is gozoedral A zoned triaxine 30edron 26acron is   of which the signatures are Z 2141 21 04  Z  21p41 02 041 Z2143     O O4 3  Z and  have each two polar faces wherefore their common axis is amphiedral ZZ have each two polar summits and have an amphigonal axis ZZ have an amphi grammic axis The nonpolar zoned features are four summits all alike in Z and four zonal edges all alike four epizonal edges alike and four faces alike in Z twelve summits as also twelve zonal edges of three configurations in Z There is nothing to prevent the three axes of a zoned triaxine having all one signa ture and axes of any janal character In every case the zonal signatures record accu rately the configurations XIII System of principal poles Zoned polyarchaxinesLet AA2A3  be a system of poles zoned or zoneless of one configuration not all in one plane in a poly edron P If each pole be joined to those nearest it by lines drawn if necessary beneath the surface of P it is evident that these lines will form a polyedron Q having edges all of one configuration i e each being the intersection of an Fgon and an Fgon If FF the polyedron Q is regular If F  F let lines be drawn from the centresf of all the Fgons to all their angles These lines produced will all pass through centres f of other faces F This is all inevitable by reason of our hypothesis that the poles AA2A3  have the same configuration Wherefore the system of lines ff will form a regular polyedron having as many edges as there are poles A1A2A3 Hence we have the Theorem The number of like poles zoned or zoneless of any polyedron which are not all in one plane is equal to that either of the summits or of the edges of a regular polyedron MDCCCLXII 129130 REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA  1 XIVXVL XIV If there be a system of collateral polar summits AlAA3  of the same con figuration in any polyedron P it can be reduced by sections passing only through edges A1A2 AA A3A4  to a regular polyedron having only the edges AA AA A3A4  If a system of principal polar summits be not collateral sections of the solid can be made removing all the edges of those summits and laying bare a system of as many principal faces of a solid having fewer edges The reciprocal of this has a system of principal polar summits which can be treated like the preceding one and thus we shall inevitably arrive finally at a solid having collateral principal summits vlich reduces by a set of simple sections as above shown to a regular polyedron It is thus proved that the only systems of principal summits zoned or zoneless are those of the regular polyedra The following description of zoned polyarchaxines is easily verified by considering the regular solids XV A zoned triarrcchaine polyedron has three 4zoned janal principal axes four 3zoned objanal secondary axes and six janal 2zoned tertiary axes The axes may have various characters V The zonal signatures of the zoned triarchaxine are Z 4sp 4S 8g4fp 4f  8GOr4 o0Pp 8a0 Z 2s  4 2  4g2f  4f2f 4G 0 2iOP2P04a04abb There are six zones Z and three zones Z The principal poles are 6sf61 The secondary poles are 8sf 81 The tertiary poles are 12s ft3121 The secondary poles as well as the tertiary are of one name only The numbers g G c b g G a b g c enumerate the nonpolar zoned features which have all different configurations The sum of these numbers  0 Every nonpolar zoned feature is read 24 times on the solid Every zoneless feature is read 48 times on the solid in as many interzonal regions XVI Def A janal zoned axis is homozonal when the axis being horizontal two opposite eyes can see in the poles at the same time one the trace t vertical between tt and the other t vertical between tt When there are but two traces in the pole one eye will see the trace t vertical and t horizontal while the opposite eye sees t vertical and t horizontal and this is the configuration seen by opposite eyes in the secondary axis of a zoned tetrarchaxine A zoned tetrarhatzne polyedron has four heteroid principal 3zoned axes and three secondary homozonal 2zoned axes It has six identical zones whose signature is Z2ssg 2ffG o 0 0 026 The principal poles are 4s f  42 1 XVI XVII REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF

tertiary 2zoned axes which may have any terminations There are fifteen identical zones whose signature is Z 2ss2g 2fpff2G  Op O44 The principal poles of the solid are 62s2f62 sPf1 the secondary poles

many interzonal spaces Observe that two zoned signatures are numerically identical if they differ only in p subscribed and in the mode of exhibiting the factors of a number There is nothing to prevent any two of the signatures having the same number of summits face and edges of art II XVII from being spoken of as the same signature Z but the polarity and repetition of the features differ with the symmetry For example the two solids have the former the zones Z   41 OP 1 z 41 21 O0P21 and the latter the zones Z 2p21 022 Z22 2p 021 We see that neglecting p subscribed Z and Z are the same signature as are Z and Z The second solid is a 4zoned monaxine heteroid having only two polar zoned features In the former every feature is polar The following will suffice for examples of zoned

poles are quadrilaterals None of the solids drawn have zoneless faces but they may have any number if we load each of the fortyeight interzonal regions with the same polyedron R 2oned or zone less If R is zoneless we shall impose R twentyfour times and its reflected image twenty four times so that the traces may be all preserved The polyedron R may be polar or not and symmetrical or not What precedes is sufficient to show that our signatures accurately record the zonal configuration What more is required for placing the polyedron upon record we shall see when we treat of registration

axial system of the regular polyedra An axis zoned or zoneless is said to be of mple repetition if the same feature presents itself m times in the same posture in a revolution of the solid about that axis Every rzoned axis is an axis of rple repetition for though it has 2r like interzonal spaces about it reflecting each other no zoneless feature presents itself more than r times in the same

of P remains unmoved that image together with P so turned forms an rple monaxine contrajanal polyedron If for example 2rm4r there will be in the mirror a repeated sequence of four edges ABCD and the configurations read by opposite eyes in the axis supposed parallel to thle page and perpendicular to the lines will be m2 ABCDABCDAB CDABCDABCD One eye sees A beyond C and to the right of that B beyond D the opposite eye sees A beyond C and to the left of that B beyond D The configurations are contrajanal IV We may take the lastdrawn solid for the polyedron P and conceive it laid by its square polar face in a mirror and then turned through ml summit while the image remains unmoved The solid with the image will form a 2ple monaxine contrajanal But it will be found impossible to produce this contrajanal configuration unless by employing a 2rmrgonal polar face and by turning the solid through m summits r being the index of repetition The monaxine heteroids which have each a repeated sequence ABC will give by this process attempted no zone less figures but monaxine heteroids This could be easily demonstrated but such demon stration would be of no future use to us in our problem And our object here is simply to prove the existence of this class of solids Further the configurations so obtained are not only contrajanal but monaxine For there is no zoneless axis in the plane of the mirror because P and its image in our con struction do not form a repeated sequence in revolution about such an axis and no point of P out of the mirror except the given pole of P can be a pole of repetition And as there is evidently still about either of the poles of P and its image an rple repetition the indicated construction is an rple monaxine contrajanal polyedron But it is not to be supposed that all these solids have like the one constructed a closed circle of zonoid edges viz the edges in the mirror But it is evident that such a circle is either drawn or drawable in any janal polyedron which shall present in the faces above and below it the same repeated sequence of faces either janal or contra janal to the two poles Our object here is not to discuss the form but to establish the existence of these polyedra XX One principal zoneless axis Zoneless rple monarchaxinesA principal axis of repetition zoned or zoneless has a higher repetition than another 1 xx REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA Let the rple heteroid monaxine P be placed by its polar mrgonal face A in any way on A the same face of P identical with P so that the summits of A and A may coincide As the two opposite poles aa of the solid PP are identical there is an axis 3 of double repetition zoned or zoneless at right angles to the axis ac and as this axis aac is rple there must be r axes 3 having r identical poles p and r identical poles p one of each kind in each repeated sequence about a Let r2 and let aa be the only principal zoneless axis of PP Then 3 is not zoned for if it were it would have at least two zones neither of which would contain the zoneless poles ao There would then be at least four poles a one between each pair of hemizones about 3 and acc would not be the only principal axis Wherefore 3 is zoneless and there are r zoneless axes 3 Let pp be two like poles of axes  most nearly contiguous They form with the prin cipal poles acr a repeated sequence wherefore there is a zoneless pole p of double repetition between p and p of a different configuration from p and there must be r zoneless poles p alternate with r zoneless poles p around the axis a The solid PP r 2 is an rple monarchaxine polyedron It has r secondary axes of dotuble repetition which are according as r is even or odd all jatnal and alternately different or all heteroid and alike and in either case the 2r poles present alternate configurations In our construction there is a sequence of zonoid edges in the faces A in general effaceable but we shall find that there are rple monarchaxines which have no such edges effaced or effaceable by effacements which shall preserve all summits Zonoid signatureEvery rple monarchaxine has a zonoid signature which gives an exact enumeration of the secondary poles whether they be faces poles or edges but no account of the number of edges in polar faces or summits This signature has the form rOP fP  OPo where rfac2 and where every solution of the latter equation gives a different system of secondary poles The distinction between the symbols 0 0 II in the account of zoneless polar edges vanishes The poles in  may be of two names or of one name only When r2 there is no principal axis the demonstration that  is zoneless fails and 3 may be a zoned axis In such case there are as many axes Oaa as there are zones about  perpendicular to aa and there cannot be more because aa being an axis of repeti tion must be central in the interzonal space in which it appears and the limiting zones of that space must evidently be both of the same configuration for otherwise ocd would be no axis of repetition In this case the symmetry is mixed and will presently be discussed When r2 and  is a zoneless axis it follows that 3 is janal otherwise aa would be no axis of repetition and as the poles of oca and 3 form a repetition there must be a third janal axis y of even repetition at right angles to acr and to X 135REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA One of these two axes P3y may be an mple zoneless principal axis of which the other two axes are secondaries Zoneless triaxinesWhen m2 the three zoneless axes vw 3 and y are all double janal axes and the solid is a zoneless triaxine polyedron The zonoid signature of a zoneless triaxine when it is recorded has the form 2oPfpO 4fpa 3 showing six poles of three of two names or of one only But we shall see that the registration of these signatures in zoneless triaxines is of no use for our purpose Every nonpolar feature of an rple monarchaxine or r 2 triaxine

that every system of principal axes is that of a regular polyedron We give an account in the zonoid signature of a polyarchaxine of its secondary and tertiary poles A zoneless triarchaxine has three

nonpolar feature is read sixty times on the solid viz five times about each extremity of every principal axis Zoneless polyarchaxines are easily constructed on zoned ones by drawing lines in every principal or secondary or tertiary face by which the zones are destroyed and the repetition preserved or by crowning like polar faces with polyedra which have a zoneless repetition of equal rank We shall see by our processes of construction that we always know the name of the pole opposite to any zoned or zoneless pole that we may be handling for we always know the character V of the axis but the number of edges in that opposite pole is not thereby given We know of course the edges of every pole that we construct but when the axis is heteroid we do not always know the exact edges of the pole opposed Hence it may happen in high values of P and Q that we do not always know the exact feature opposite to a given principal pole of a tetrarchaxine But this is not of the least consequence in our problem and if we should wish to know what is the exact feature so opposite a question that never arises in our argument we can easily determine the point by other considerations 3 Mixed

the solid MM The sequence PpPp is a repetition there is therefore a pole of even repetition between p and p which is a zoneless pole because no zone by hypothesis intervenes between p and p 1 XXII REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA and there will be 2r of these zoneless poles one central between every two hemizones about the rzoned axis And as the same sequence PpPp is read about them all the 2rzoneless poles have all one configuration or configurations of which one is the reflected image of another Let PP be the only principal axis of the solid then as the pole P can recur only twice in a revolution about the zoneless poles they are all of double repetition Where fore there are rjanal and similar axes of zoneless double repetition in a plane perpendi cular to the rzoned axis PP 1 Let r be odd then every zone of the axis PP is perpendicular to one of the r zoneless axes r symmetry would be impossible and it is consequently a repeating zone of which every nonpolar feature is an objanal monozone featture i e a feature f diame trically opposite to another which is to an opposite eye the inverted image off art IV Further when r is odd the poles cac of any one of the r zoneless axes are contrajanal poles for if not the axis as will be strictly janal such that two opposite eyes iu the axis will read exactly the same configuratonras from left to right therefore the axis PP perpendicular to tcW1 will be an axis of even repetition since the same pole a recurs exactly in half a revolution about PP which is absurd because r being odd PP is an axis of odd repetition XVIII Therefore oao is when r is odd a contrajanal axis 2 Let r be even then because the axis PP is of even repetition the configurations read by two opposite eyes in the axis aa are strictly identical and aa is a zoneless 2ple strictly janal axis When r is even either zone of M conspires to form the zone of the solid MM as is evident from the position of the trace t upon the trace t For this reason the solid is called homozone the two zones of M being confounded together And this name is con veniently used to designate the solid MM whether r be odd or even The axis PP is an rzoned homozone axis When r 2 the axis PP is a principal axis and the solid is a homozone monarchaxine polyedron When r2 there is no principal axis XX as the zoned axis has like the two zoneless ones but a

REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA 141 Homozones may be easily constructed by drawing janal reticulations like the following 3P 2 The interior marginal triangles are supposed to present in the inferior face of the reti culation precisely the configuration formed by the exterior ones in the upper polar face The first is a 4zoned homozone reticulation which becomes a 4zoned homozone polyedron if crowned in both the upper and lower faces by octaces whose rays pass to the eight marginal triangles The second is a 4zoned monarchaxine reticulation and becomes a 2zoned homozone polyedron if crowned in the upper face by an octace upon the four upper marginal triangles and upon the four summits 1 2 3 4 and if crowned below by an octace upon the four lower triangles and upon

faces of G configurations c Every zoneless feature except the two zoneless poles is read 2r times on the rple monozone monaxine The designation of monaxine contrajanal belongs to these solids in strictness as well as to those of art XIX But there can never be any confusion in our terms if the zoneless polyedra of XIX be called by that name which is to be understood as zoneless if the term monozone be wanting A 2ple monaxine monozone is   l whose zonal signature Z21 2 O1 a0 The zoneless axis is amphigrammic 2ple and contrajanal Monaxine mjonozones are readily constructed on simple

and below by octaces through the same four points 12 3 4 and through the marginal triangles By such coronation the principal zones of the reticulation are destroyed but the 4ple repetition is preserved and the secondary zone of the reticulation in the plane of the page is preserved also XXIV Theorem There cannot be more than one principal axis in a mixed sym metry For we have proved XIII XIV that the only systems of principal axes are those of the regular polyedra In a zoned polyarchaxine there can be no zoneless poles for if there were one there would be one at least in every interzonal region i e there would be 24 48 or 120 and such a number of similar poles has been proved impossible in XIII For a like reason there can be no zoned pole about any of the zoneless poles of a polyarchaxine and consequently no zone for if there were one zone there would be many and therefore zoned axes and poles IHence the theorem is proved From this theorem it follows that there cannot be in the solid PP of the preceding article any other axis than aod For if there were another either 1 ao would be a prin cipal axis or 2 there would be one principal axis of more than 3rple repetition or 3 there would be no principal axis 1 If Ca be a principal axis every secondary axis j3 will be at right angles to ac otherwise there would be more than one axis a in the sequence repeated about 3 which is impossible by the preceding theorem and 3 will be a 2mple axis because the pole a occurs in half a revolution about j3 but there is no axis of even repetition at right angles to cc by the reasoning of XXII because aa is contrajanal Therefore ao is no principal axis 2 If there be a principal axis A different from ac since it is not at right angles to the zone FF there will be by the definition of a zone II more than one such axis A which is impossible by the preceding theorem 3 If there be no principal axis there will be at least about the pole of aa 3r1 XXIV XXv REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA 143 identical poles of 3rple repetition and these will form by the reasoning of XIII a polyarchipolar system which is absurd if there be no principal axis It is therefore impossible that there can be any axis in PP except aJc unless r2 3 r in the preceding article If we had taken a a double axis we might or might not have completed in that article a monaxine monozone Nothing prevents the existence of other double axes a each perpendicular to a different zone F The solid PP constructed might thus have been a2mlzoned homozone having 2m1 contrajanal double axes XXII 4 Neuter Symmetry XXV The polyedra which have a neuter symmetry are of one species only viz Contrajanal anaxine polyedraLet F be any 2mgonal zoneless nonpolar face of a polyedron P and let P be placed on a mirror by the face F and turned through two right angles while the image P remains unmoved The solid PP constructed by P so turned and by the image P may be a contrajanal anaxine polyedron It will be such if it has neither pole nor zone It is evident that to any edge ab on one side of the mirror there corresponds another diametrically opposite edge ab on the other side in the image such that the configura tion seen along ab to the right is that read along ab to the left The edges of the solid PP in all cases form janal anaxine pairs ab ab of edges diametrically opposite unless P be such that by our construction we have completed a zoned or polar symmetry in which case certain of the pairs will be zoned or polar Every feature f is twice read on a contrajanal anaxine

the axis are destroyed144 EEV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA  1 XXVXXIX Observe that the term janal along with anaxine always means contrajanal XXVI Def Ajanal anaxine pair on any polyedron are any two edges ab ab diametri cally opposite nonpolar antd zoneless such that the configuration read along ab to the right is exactly that read by an opposite eye along ab to the left Ajanal anaxine Agon or Aace is any zoneless nonpolar face or summit whose A edges form with those of an opposite Agon or Aace A janal anaxine pairs For example A and A are janal anaxine triaces in the lastdrawn polyedron Thus we see that there are janal anaxine edges in solids which are not janal anaxine polyedra XXVII It is important that we should here determine what kinds of polyedra have janal anaxine pairs 1 Let P be a polyedron of zoned or mixed symmetry which has janal anaxine pairs The janal anaxine pair ab ab will either meet on a zone Z or ab will meet ab and a6 will meet ab on a zone Z II The pair ab a6b being diametrically opposite may be supposed parallels Then the zoneless ab meets its reflected image ab and a b1 meets abl on Z and the angle ab ab has exactly the configuration of ab ab and is dia metrically opposite thereto Hence Z must be a repeating zone to which an axis of even repetition is perpendicular for the same configuration recurs about that axis in half a revolution It is then requisite and sufficient in order that a zoned polyedron have janal anaxine pairs that it have a zone perpendicular to an axis zoned or zoneless of even repetition XXVIII The 2mlzoned monarchaxine XII has none of its 2ml secondary axes perpendicular to a zone for each of these axes is in one of the 2m1 zones The 2m1zoned monarchaxine has nojanal anaxine edge The 2mzoned monarchaxine polyedron has every secondary axis in one zone and perpendicular to another XI VII The 2mzoned monarchaxine has janal anaxine pairs The 2mlple monaxine monozone has them not the axis being of odd repetition The 2mple monaxine monozone has such edges The 2m1zoned homozone has them XXII The 2mzoned homozone has them not The zoned triarchaxine polyedron has each of its six tertiary axes in two of its nine zones and perpendicular to one of them otherwise symmetry would be impossible The zoned triarchaxine has janal anaxine edges No secondary axis of a zoned tetrarchaxine is perpendicular to any of its six zones for this axis is in two of them The zoned tetrarchaxine has no janal anaxine edges Each of the fifteen tertiary axes of a zoned hexarchaxine is in two of the fifteen zones wherefore it is perpendicular to one of them or symmetry would be impossible The zoned hexarchaxine has janal anaxine edges XXIX 2 Let P be a polyedron of zoneless symmetry which has janal anaxine edges 1 XXIX XX REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA 145 The edge ab makes with the zoneless pole a of P a configuration which is the reflected image of that made by the opposite edge ab with the opposite pole a of a janal axis The only zoneless polyedron whose opposite janal poles can have such a configuration is the rple monaxine contrajanal polyedron XIX And we see by considering the repeated sequence of faces above and below any closed line drawn or drawable on the polyedron equidistant from both poles as for example XIX ABCDABCD CDABCDAB for r even 2 and ABCDABCDABCD CDABCDABCDAB for r odd  3 A A C that the edge C diametrically opposite to C in the former does not but that the edge A A diametrically opposite to C in the latter does present to two eyes either in the plane of the sequence or at the poles a contrajanal configuration as compared with the first edge A The same thing is easily proved by taking any sequence of 2m faces and comparing the cases of r odd and r even The same thing is also proved thus If ab ab are a janal anaxine pair about a zone less axis of rple repetition the line bisecting the two edges is a diameter XXV and the plane containing it and the axis is a diametral plane There are about the axis r1 other similar janal anaxine diameters symmetrically disposed and such symmetry is evidently impossible unless r1 be even that is unless r be odd The rple monaxine contrajanalpolyedron has janal anaxine pairs if r be odd but not if r be even In all other zoneless polyedra the opposite poles of a janal axis have configurations which are exact repetitions of each other to opposite eyes wherefore the configuration read by one eye along an edge ab which configuration includes the pole canlot be the reflected image of that read along ab by an opposite eye No polyedron of zoneless synmmetry except the monaxine contrajanal has janal cnaxine edges XXX We have proved that janal anaxine edges are found in the

numbers we shall consider in the order following EFTTUKMNNNSSDWLBCJASO in Table A XXXI and e f h i in Tables C XXXIV One difficulty of our problem lies in the danger incurred of enumerating the same

and we cannot be certain without consideration when we con struct a 5ple 4ple 3ple or 2ple axis zoned or zoneless that we do not thereby com plete a polyarchaxine For example if weload all the principal faces but two opposite ones of a regular 12edron with 5gonal pyramids pentaces dxr we have in the two void faces an amphi edral axis of a 5zoned homozone polyedron If in our processes we were to charge this 2 xxXVII REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA 157 on its two pentagon poles with pentaces we should certainly thereby construct an amphi gonal 5zoned homozone axis But it would be an error to enumerate the construction among the homozones for we have evidently here only completed a hexarchaxine In like manner in constructing a 2zoned janal axis we cannot be sure that we have not been completing by secondary or tertiary poles a monarchaxine or a polyarchaxine E F E 2rzoned monarchaxines XXXIWhen r2 every 2rzoned heterozone polar face of Table B XXXII gives a

of P we obtain the solid here figured where 1 2 3 5 are the summits of P and 52 and 13 are the effaced edges This is a homozone triaxine in which the edges 32 21 15 53 of P have  become zoneless polar edges This homozone will be registered in our Table and if as will 6 inevitably happen in our processes we draw the polar edges 52 13 we construct a homozone amphigrammic axis to which two 4 3 2ple

which can be made to appear by p subscribed in the zonal signature We have simply completed a zoned tetrarchaxine And this ambiguity may occur in far more complex constructions in which the secondary poles may be faces or summits If however when we have completed a 2zoned homozone by coronation either with lines as above or with a pair of summits we find that we have completed a zonal signa ture

the seven classes of XXX are all entered under the number k XXXIII for r2nl Inspection of the signatures of repetition in all these polar Agons zoned or zoneless gives us the number of different zoneless nonpolar edges that is of janal anaxine edges in them all Let this number be Aa The zoned nonpolar Agons are all given by e XXXVI under the numbers j k 1 XXXIV whence that of their different zoneless edges is given also Let this be Aa Then all the remaining Aja Aa Aa janal anaxine edges of Agons must be found in janal anaxine Agons XXVI and if we consider as we may without confusion the 2AAjaa above written as double edges we can say that all these remaining edges are found in no Agons which are not janal ahaxine Each Agon has A of them wherefore AA h XXXIV A 2 XLIX L REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLTEDRA is the number of the janal anaxine Agons on all the Pedra Qacra or of janal anaxine Aaces in the Qedra Pacra i Asymmetric Agons of Pedra Qacra XXXIV L We know by g XXXVI the number of asymmetric edges of Agons of Pedra Qacra which are all entered under the numberf XXXV We have 2AAasAB aACa A for this entire number By inspection of our Table C XXXIV we see that there are in all the polar and zoned Agons entered under a b c d e f d e f XXXIV which comprise all the symmetric Agons of Table C the number A of different zoneless nonpolar edges in these Agons The remaining AaA must be all edges in asymmetric Agons wherefore AasAas AA i XXXIV is the number of asymmetric Agons of the Pedra Qacra If we would know the number i of these which are not janal anaxine Agons we have i A AaAj7  ASa  Aa A As the Tables A B C D are supposed to contain the same account of the features both of Pedra Qacra and of Qedra Pacra we can obtain all the results of XXXVII L alike for both Pedra Qacra and for Qedra Pacra and with every face enumerated we have also its reciprocal summit Thus we have demonstrated in this second section that the data of art XXXVI are sufficient for the entire completion of the Tables A B C D XXXI XXXV for faces and for summits All that remains for the complete solution of our problem of classification and enumeration of the Pedra Qacra and Qedra Pacra is that we show how these data XXXVI can be obtained and registered without ambiguity or repetition We shall consider first the reciprocals of the faces d f XXXVI and the edges g XXXVI NOTE ON ARTICLES XLIX AND LThe number Aas in art L is intended to comprise all edges of zoneless nonpolar Agons and should have been defined as including the numbers b and d of XXXV for these although symmetric edges are often edges of asymmetric Agons The reader will therefore con ceive that the numbers AAapob and AAod for every zonal signature are included in the third line of L And by the firstnamed edges in the seventh line of L are meant edges not epizonal in those Agons In like manner the number Aja in XLIX is intended to comprise all zoneless polar edges and all zonal edges in all zones of Agons on the solids of XXX for these are often edges of janal anaxine Agons The polars are in our signatures the zonals ought to have been registered in a separate table in XXXV as objanal zonal edges i e edges AAobxo of Agons in a repeating zone XXVII These are either diagonal traces drawn in objanal monozone 2A2gons or crowning edges of 2A2gonal objanal monozone penesolids of which we shall obtain in the sequel an accurate account This will be all made clear in our applications 165

MEMBER OF THE LITERARY AND PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETIES OF MANCHESTER AND LIVERPOOL RECEIVED JANUARY 3READ JANUARY 23 1862 THE FOLLOWING MEMOIR CONTAINS A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM OF THE CLASSIFICATION AND ENUMERATION OF THE PEDRA QACRA THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION OF THE SOLIDS IS A TASK IMPRACTICABLE FROM ITS MAGNITUDE BUT IT IS HERE SHOWN TLHAT WE CAN ENUMERATE THEM WITH AN ACCURATE ACCOUNT OF THEIR SYMMETRY TO ANY VALUES OF P AND Q SECTION FIRST DISCUSSES FULLY THE SYMMETRY OF POLYEDRA AND GIVES A SKETCH OF THE TABLES WHICH IT IS REQUIRED TO FORM FOR THE SOLUTION OF OUR PROBLEM

CONSTRUCTION OF POLAR AND MONOZONE RETICTULATIONS AND TO THEIR REGISTRATION WITH THEIR SIGNATURES OF FORM AND SYMMETRY IN GROUPS WHICH SUFFICE FOR OUR PROBLEM SECTION FIFTH GIVES FORMULEE FOR THE ZONED AND ZONELESS CORONATION OF A POLAR OR MONO ZONE PERFECT RETICULATION WHEREBY IT BECOMES A POLYEDRON AND TABLES OF THE PERFECT SUMMITS THUS OBTAINED ARE SKETCHED OUT SECTION SIXTH ENUMERATES AND REGISTERS THE RESULTS OF DELTOTOMOUS EFFACEMENTS ABOUT PERFECT SUMMITS THAT IS SUMMITS ABOUT WHICH ALL DELTOTOMOUS EFFACEABLES HAVE BEEN RESTORED OR WHICH HAVE NO EFFACED EFFACEABLES WHEREBY THE SUMMIT ANALYSED IN SECTION THIRD IS OBTAINED AND REGISTERED SECTION SEVENTH ANALYSES THE POLAR SUMMITS OF A JANAL AXIS THE RHOMBOTOMOUS EFFACE ABLES OF THE OPPOSITE SUMMITS ARE DEFINED AND AS WELL AS THEIR DELTOTOMOUS ONES RESTORED ABOUT EITHER POLE THE JANCAL RETICULATION LAID BARE BY THE REMOVAL OF THE SUMMITS IS ANALYSED AND REDUCED SECTION EIGHTH CONSTRUCTS ENNMERATES AND REGISTERS WITH THEIR

POLYARCHAXINE RETICULATION LAID BARE BY THE REMOVAL OF THESE POLAR SUMMITS IS REDUCED AND AFTERWARDS CONSTRUCTED WITH ENUMERATION AND REGISTRATION OF RESULTS THE FORMULHE FOR POLYARCHAXINE CORONATION ARE GIVEN AND THE RESULTS OF EFFACE MENT ABOUT THE PRINCIPAL AXES ARE ENUMERATED AND REGISTERED SECTION SEVENTEENTH GIVES THE ANALYSIS CONSTRUCTION AND ENUMERATION OF CONTRAJANAL ANAXIE PAIRS OF EDGES WHICH HAVE NEITHER POLAR NOR ZONED SYMMETRY BUT OF WHICH ONE EDGE IS THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE OTHER AND DIAMETRICALLY OPPOSED TO IT THE REST OF THE MEMOIR IS DEVOTED TO THE ENUMERATION OF PLANE

SYMMETRY SECTION TWENTIETH CONSTRUCTS ENUMERATES AND REGISTERS WITH THEIR SIGNATURES THE ZONED PLANE RETICZLATIONS SECTION TWENTYFIRST GIVES THE LIKE ACCOUNT OF THE ZONELESS PLANE RETICULATIONS IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT MY PREVIOUS LABOURS ON THE PARTITIONS OF THE RGON THAT IS ON PLANE RETICULATIONS ARE OF LITTLE UTILITY FOR THIS PROBLEM OF THE POLYEDRA BY REASON OF THEIR TOO GREAT GENERALITY AND OF THEIR NOT GIVING THE NUIMBER OF MARYINAL TRIANGLES IN EACH PARTITION YET THE FUNDAMENTAL THEOREM ON THE KDIVISIONS OF THE RGON HAS BEEN THE KEY TO THE GREATEST DIFFICULTY IN THIS THEORY WHICH IS TO FIND THE NUMBER OF THE ASYMMETRIC PLANE RETICULATIONS WHICH HAVE A GIVEN MARGINAL SIGNATURE OF THE TWO SECTIONS HERE PRESENTED TO THE PUBLIC THE FIRST ARTS I XXXV IS ILIN ITSELF A COMPLETE TREATISE ON THE SYMMETRY AND CLASSIFICATION OF POLYEDRA AND THE SECOND TOGETHER WITH THE PRECEDING INTRODUCTION PUTS THE READER CLEARLY IN POSSESSION OF THE MAIN OUTLINE OF THE ARGUMENT MUCH REMAINS OF THE ENTIRE WORK WHICH IS HOWEVER COMPLETELY WRITTEN AND IN THE POSSESSION OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY AS WELL AS EXTENSIVE APPLICATIONS OF THE METHOD TO THE ENUMERATION OF POLYEDRA THESE WILL BE INTELLIGIBLE ONLY WHEN

THE GREATER PART OF THE POLYEDRA ARE ENTIRELY ASYMMETRIC IN CONSIDERING THIS SYMMETRY WE HAVE NO REGARD TO MERE LENGTHS OR INCLINATIONS OF EDGES THE SYMMETRY IS DESCRITIVE NOT METRICAL FOR EXAMPLE IF THE CUTTING EDGE OF A WEDGE BE REMOVED BY ANY QUADRILATERAL SECTION THE SOLID ACQUIRES FOR OUR PURPOSES ALL THE SYMMETRY OF THE CUBE AND THIS REMAINS HOWEVER THE FIGURE MAY BE DISTORTED 1 ZONED

AXES E ZONED POLYARCHAXINES HAVING THE AXIAL SYSTEMS OF THE REGULAR POLYEDRA THE TERMS WILL BE EXPLAINED BELOW DEF A ZONE IS ANY CLOSED LINE DRAZWN OR DRAWABLE ON A POLYEDRON WHICH DIVIDES IT INTO HALVES EITHER OF WHICH IS THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE OTHER NO REGARD BEING HAD TO MERE LENGTHS OF EDGES THE CLOSED LINE MAY OR MAY NOT BE ALL IN ONE PLANE AND THE HALVES MAY OR MAY NOT BE METRICALLY EQUAL WE HAVE A RIGHT TO CONCEIVE WHEN IT IS CONVENIENT THAT THE SOLID IS CONSTRUCTED WITH THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SYMMETRY IN WHICH CASE THE HALVES WILL BE EXACTLY EQUAL AND THE ZONE WILL BE A PLANE HAVING TO THEM THE GEOMETRICAL RELATION WHICH A MIRROR HAS TO AN OBJECT TOUCHING IT AND TO ITS IMAGE THIS RELATION WE SHALL ASSUME AS ALWAYS EXISTING HOWEVER THE POLYEDRON MAY BE DIS TORTED THAT IS WE ASSUME THAT ANY ZONELESS EDGE WILL MEET ON ANY ZONAL PLANE IF IT BE PRODUCED THE EDGE WHICH IS ITS REFLECTED IMAGE IN RESPECT OF THAT ZONAL PLANE FOR EXAMPLE ANY SECTION OF A CUBE WHICH PASSES THROUGH TWO OPPOSITE FACES AND CON TAINS EITHER TWO EDGES OR NONE OF THE SOLID IS A ZONE EVERY ZONE HAS A ZONAL SIGNATURE Z WHICH DESCRIBES IT BY THE NUMNBER OF ITS ZONED FEATURES I E ITS ZONAL FACES AND ITS ZONAL SUMMITS THROUGH WHICH IT PASSES AND ITS ZONAL AND EPIZONAL EDGES BUT GIVES NO ACCOUNT OF THE NUMBER OF EDGES IN THE ZONED FACES OR SUMMITS NOR OF THE ORDER OF THE ZONED FEATURES ANY EDGE CONTAINED BY THE ZONE Z IS A ZONAL EDGE OF Z ANY EDGE CUT BY THE ZONE IS AN EPIZONAL EDGE OF Z IT WILL CREATE NO CONFUSION IF WE DENOTE BOTH THE ZONE AND ITS SIGNATURE BY THE SAME NAME Z WE REPRESENT ZONAL AND EPIZONAL EDGES BY THE SYMBOLS 0 AND 0 ZERO FACES AND WE WRITE THE NUMBER OF SUCH EDGES AS AN INDEX OVER THE PROPER SYMBOL ALL SUCH INDICES IN A ZONAL SIGNATURE ARE COECFFIENTS R 2 123REV T P

ZONELESS IF THE CONFIGURATION C OR IF THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF C WHICH IS READ AT ONE EXTREMITY OF THE AXIS CAN BE READ BY AN OPPOSITE EYE AT THE OTHER EXTREMITY BY TURNING THE AXIS THROUGH ANY ANGLE IN PARTICULAR A JANAL ZONED AXIS IS SAID TO BE OBJANAL WHEN THE CONFIGURATION C READ AT ONEPOLE OR EXTREMITY IS THE CONFIGURATION C READ AT THE OTHER POLE BY AN OPPOSITE EYE IN THE AXIS TURNED THROUGH TWO RIGHT ANGLES C BEING C INVERTED ALSO A JANAL ZONELESS AXIS IS SAID TO BE CONTRAJANAL IF THE CONFIGURATION C READ AT ONE POLE IS THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE CONFIGURATION C WHICH CAN BE READ BY AN OPPOSITE EYE AT THE OTHER DEF AN AXIS WHETHER ZONED OR ZONELESS IS HETEROID IF THE CONFIGURATION C READ AT ONE POLE CANNOT BE READ AT THE OTHER NOR READ INVERTED NOR REFLECTED V ACCORDING TO THE CHARACTER OF THE POLAR FEATURES TERMINATING AN AXIS ZONED OR ZONELESS THE AXIS IS AMPHIEDRAL AMJPHIGONAL AMPHIGRAMMIC GONOGRAMMIC EDROGRAMMIC OR GONOEDRAL TERMS WHICH EXPLAIN THEMSELVES AN AXIS IS

BELONG TO A THIRD VI THEOREM THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT HEMIZONAL SEQUENCES OF CONFIGURATION AND ONLY TZUO READ ALTERNATELY UPON THE HEMIZONES ABOUT A ZONED AXIS 124 1 VIIX REV T P KIRKMAN ON THE THEORY OF THE POLYEDRA FOR 1 THERE CANNOT BE FEWER THAN TWO BECAUSE IF TWO CONTIGUOUS HEMIZONES HAD EXACTLY THE SAME CONFIGURATION THEY WOULD BE EACH THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE OTHER AND THEREFORE NOT CONTIGUOUS BUT ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF A DIFFERENT ZONE AND 2 THERE CANNOT BE MORE THAN TWO FOR EVERY HEMIZONE A HAS ON EITHER HAND BY DEFINITION OF A ZONE THE SAME HEMIZONE B AND B HAS ON EITHER HAND THE SAME HEMI ZONE A THE PROPOSITIONS OF THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE ARE EASY DEDUCTIONS FIOM THE ABOVE THEOREM WE USE THE TERM PERPENDICULAR IN A WIDE SENSE IN CONSIDERATION OF ART II THAT IS UNDER THE ASSUMPTION OF THE GREATEST POSSIBLE SYMMETRY VII WHEN THERE IS AN EVEN NUMBER OF ZONES ABOUT A ZONED AXIS EACH IS PERPEN DICULAR TO ANOTHER AND HAS TWO IDENTICAL HEMIZONES IF A 2MZONED AXIS IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE SOLID THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT ENTIRE ZONAL CONFIGURATIONS ABOUT THE AXIS VIZ M ZONES Z ALTERNATING WITH THE M ZONES Z THE SIGNATURES OF Z AND Z MAY OR MAY NOT BE DIFFERENT THE CONFIGURATIONS CANNOT BE THE SAME WHEN THERE ARE 4M ZONES EACH IS PERPENDICULAR TO ONE OF THE SAME CONFIGURATION WHEN THE NUMBER OF ZONES IS 4M2 EACH IS PERPENDICULAR TO ONE OF A DIFFERENT CON FIGURATION WHEN THE NUMBER OF ZONES IS ODD NONE IS PERPENDICULAR TO ANOTHER WHEN THE AXIS IS 2MNZONED THERE ARE IN EACH POLAR FEATURE MN TRACES T ALTERNATING WITH M TRACES T WHEN THE AXIS IS 2MLZONED THE POLAR FACE OR SUMMIT HAS 2M1 IDENTICAL TRACES ABOUT A 2MLZONED AXIS THERE IS BUT ONE ENTIRE ZONAL CONFIGURATION AND CONSE QUENTLY BUT ONE SIGNATURE FOR ALL THE ZONES THESE ZONES HAVE NOT EACH TWO IDENTICAL HEMIZONES WHETHER THE R ZONES BE ODD OR EVEN THE 2R SEMITRACES PRESENT ALTERNATE CONFIGURA TIONS IN THE CIRCUIT OF THE POLE EACH TRACE HAS TWO LIKE TERMINATIONS IF R BE EVEN AND TWO DIFFERENT TERMINATIONS IF R BE ODD VIII THEOREM IF A ZONED AXIS IS THE ONLY AXIS OF THE POLYEDRON THAT AXIS IS HETEROID FOR IF NOT THE OPPOSITE POLES WILL BE EITHER IDENTICAL OR ONE THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE OTHER IF THEY ARE IDENTICAL THERE IS AN AXIS OF EVEN REPETITION PERPENDICULAR TO THE ZONED AXIS I E AN AXIS ABOUT WHICH IN REVOLUTION OF THE SOLID THE SAME CONFIGURATION IS 2M TIMES

EQUATION AOFJ A 2 WHERE A 2 DIFFERS NOT FROM 32 IN FORM WE CONSIDER TWO ZONED FEATURES OF WHICH ONE IS THE REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE OTHER TO BE THE SAME IN CONFIGURATION AND ENUMERATE THE TWO AS ONE IN OUR TABLES OF ZONED FEATURES THE ABOVE SIGNATURES SHOW G G A B AND G G  B FOR THE NUMBER OF THEIR DIFFERENT ZONED NONPOLAR FEATURES FOR EACH ZONE HAS TWO IDENTICAL HEMIZONES WHEN M IS EVEN BUT NOT

wonder as they scan A living thinking breathing man Confirmedanother test to plead And this man is no inexperienced girl but a woman who has wrestled with the college requirements in English for fifteen years and more In bygone days she has led fainting troops across the unpronounceable deserts of Siberia in the rear of a fleeing Tartar tribe She has listened to the thrilling periods of Websters Bunker Hill oration as rendered by a girl who couldnt read three consecutive words correctly even when her mind was on them and whose mind was more than ninetenths occupied in wondering whether or not the boy across the aisle would ask her to dance with him that evening at the Sophomore reception Then on the other hand this teacher remembers some rare and wonderful moments in her classes when for instance a girl has read Home they brought her warrior slain with such feeling and expression that schoolroom surroundings were forgotten and class and teacher alike felt the hush of the chamber of death and the relief that came when the mothers tears flowed over the dead mans child or when some boy with a deep voice and a manly intelligence has read the peroration of Burkes speech on Conciliation grandly bringing out all the nobility of thought and language till we saw the vision as it came to the mind of the great statesman of a mighty and generous people abandoning petty questions of interest and of policy and elevating their minds to the greatness of that trust to which the order of Provi dence called them Such reading is worth forty pages of notes and a hundred examination questions Have you guessed the additional requirement for which I plead It is a test in reading aloud We teachers can get up I90AN ADDITIONAL COLLEGE REQUIREMENT IN ENGLISH 191 little enthusiasm over the subject as matters stand now and sorely against our consciences are often obliged to neglect this important branch of education But if there were a test to be passed or if certificate rank of 80 must be attained in reading as in other subjects there would be a renewal of interest in the oral interpretation of the masterpieces we are called upon to teach which would be of incalculable value to our students whatever calling in life they follow Then too we might thus gain time and opportunity to train the American voice whose strident tones are so severely criti cized by foreigners A few years ago in Paris in a crowded room of the Musee de Cluny I heard the piercing tones of a feminine voice saying Wheres the old Roman swinging bath I cant find it anywhere All turned to look at the speaker a very pretty young American girl who tore across the room well pleased to be the object of attention and quite unconscious that her compatriots were ashamed both of her ignorance and her bad manners She had misread swinging for swimming it appeared This girl or her prototype appears at every corner in Europe On behalf of her teachers I plead for a better chance to train her in reading and speakingeven at the expense of sparing her a few halfdigested facts This brings me to the practical question which stands like a lion in the path Where shall we get the time But you remem ber that when Christian reached the lions he found that they were securely chained Whether from lack of faith on our part or some other cause our lions are not often thus fastened but ramp about ready to devour the neglectful so I would cannily lasso them beforehand I would remove from the present requirements in English to a very large extent the study of the lives of the authors In most cases these are none of our busi ness anyhow To be sure our students must know something of the authors place in and influence upon literature but I am con vinced that we could cut out with great advantage much of the study of their private lives If we could put the question to the authors themselves who can doubt what their answer would be THE SCHOOL REVIEW Even the pure and greatsouled Milton might well quail before the vision of a generation of school girls criticizing his treatment of his daughters while as for the rest is there one among them who would not gladly choose oblivion in regard to some points at least of his career Have you never heard Macbeths speeches so murdered that Duncan was half avenged Have you not heard the Passing of Arthur given with such halting and stumbling that your soul cried out within you for time to teach that boy to read or authority to condition him because he couldnt read I believe we are failing in our duty to the rank and file of our pupils in not demanding of them the ability to read aloud intelli gently what they have studied as well as to write the answers to questions upon it There is a tradition that when Daniel Webster presented himself for admission to Phillips Exeter Academy a New Testa ment was given him with the request that he read aloud a passage He read it in his grandest manner with Godgifted organ voice and was at once admitted to the school without further examination I am not quite so radical as to advocate admitting a student to collegenot even an embryo Daniel Websterin Algebra and Plane Geometry because he can read his mother tongue with correctness and intelligence but I do believe that the ability to read thus would be more useful to our girls and boys and a more reasonable thing to demand of their immature youth than to expect them to write an account of the psychological development of the character of Godfrey Cass or the history of Sir Walter Scotts financial difficulties I92

Zoological Society writes to the London Times The recent death of the Polar bear a popular favorite at the Zoological Gardens since 1895 has caused some interest and has been the occasion of many published comments based on inaccurate information Perhaps you will allow me space to state the facts The bear was in good health and spirits and fed well until the afternoon of Sunday November 1 when soon after taking food it fell backwards and died almost in stantaneously The postmortem changes were unusually rapid and next day an examination was made in the presence of Mr Beddard the societys prosector and myself and a prelim inary diagnosis was arrived at Subsequently Dr Salaman pathologist to the London Hos pital a fellow of the society who has very kindly placed his services at the disposal of the society until the return from abroad of 39 the special pathologist recently appointed by the council made a careful examination of the material that we had reserved and established the correctness of the preliminary diagnosis that the cause of death was an aortic aneurism The case was of great scientific interest and Dr Salaman will communicate to a future scientific meeting of the society a detailed ac count of it I may say now however that except for the local lesion the organs and tissues were healthy and it is extremely im probable that the creature suffered It would have been impossible to make the diagnosis during life or had we known of the existence of the disease to have taken any steps for its treatment I may add that while in the past very considerable additions to anatomical knowledge have been made at the prosectorium attached to the gardens the council of the society by increasing the accommodation for pathological work and by appointing a special pathologist hope that additions to knowledge of the treatment of animals will be made BARON EDMUND DE ROTHSCHILD has placed in the hands of M Albert Gaudry president of the Paris Academy of Sciences

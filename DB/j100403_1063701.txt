of action is established Magee v Holland supra And in Howell v Howell 162 N C 283 78 S E 222 45 L R A N S 867 Ann Cas 1914A 893 it was held that the jury had a right to award compensatory damages for the wrong and for the mental anguish and might also award punitive damages SPECIFIC PERFORMANCECONTRACT TO CONVEY LANDTIME AS OF THE EssENcEAppellant and appellee signed a memorandum of sale in which appellant agreed to convey land to appellee the agreement providing that unless the sale should be concluded within thirty days appellees deposit receipt of which was therein acknowledged should be forfeited Ten days after the time fixed in the contract for its performance had expired appellants attorney accepted from appellees attorney the bal ance of purchase money due The appellant however refused to con vey the property and appellee brought suit for specific performance Held appellee not entitled to specific performance Stern v Shapiro Md 114 Atl 587 In actions at law it is well settled that time is of the essence of con tracts to convey land and a strict compliance within the time stipulated is required Hill v Fisher 34 Me 143 Shinn v Roberts 20 N J L 435 43 Am Dec 636 But in equity time is prima facie not essential unless expressly declared to be essential or unless it clearly appears to be so from the nature of the contract and since equity treats pro visions as to time of performance as formal rather than essential it will not hesitate to compel specific performance after the time has ex pired Vance v Newman 72 Ark 359 80 S W 574 105 Am St Rep 42 Jones v Robbins 29 Me 351 50 Am Dec 593 In any case however the awarding of specific performance is not mandatory upon the chancellor but is a matter of sound discretion since the plaintiff was delinquent in not performing his part of the contract by the appointed time Young v Daniels 2 Iowa 126 63 Am Dec 477 Boldt v Early 33 Ind App 434 70 N E 271 104 Am St Rep 255 Unless it clearly appears that time was regarded by the parties as essential courts of equity will grant specific performance requiring the defendant to make a deed to plaintiff and compensating the former by allowing him interest on the deferred payments because compensation not forfeiture is a favorite maxim in a court of equity Frink v Thomas 20 Or 265 26 Pac 717 12 L R A 239 Clauses which make time an essential element in contracts to con vey land are construed strictly Thus a mere naming of the days when payments will fall due does not render the contract void if payments are not made promptly Vance v Newman supra And if it would be unreasonable to allow it time will not be held essential even where the contract to convey land declares it to be essential Richmond v Robinson 12 Mich 193 Again where the contract expressly called for a forfeiture of the payments already made in case any subsequent in stallment should be omitted at the time due the court found that time was not of the essence and compelled the vendor to give specificRECENT DECISIONS 65 performance Edgerton v Peckham 11 Paige N Y 352 It has even been held that the vendor cannot rescind a contract for delinquency in the payment of an installment where it was agreed after the original contract was made that upon the vendees failure to pay promptly all prior payments should be forfeited De Camp v Feay 5 Serg  R Pa 323 9 Am Dec 372 It is doubtful whether these last two de cisions are sound The more reasonable rule of the United States Su preme Court is that in such cases of late payments by the vendee specific performance will be given only if his failure to pay promptly was excusable as where the vendors conduct encouraged the purchaser to defer payment and the latter with but little delay tendered payment in lawful money Cheney v Libby 134 U S 68 On principle and by the weight of authority the better rule is that announced in the instant case viz that wherever the parties to a contract to convey land have deliberately stipulated that time shall be of the essence or used words to that effect a court of equity will so construe the contract and leave the vendee without a remedy if he does not comply in time Waterman v Banks 144 U S 394 Garretson v Vanloon 3 G Greene Iowa 128 54 Am Dec 492 Wilcoxson v Stitt 65 Cal 596 4 Pac 629 52 Am Rep 310 TELEGRAPHS AND TELEPHONESINJURY BY FAILURE TO FURNISH TULE PHONE SERVICE ACTIONABLEPlaintiff who was a regular subscriber of defendant company discovered that two of his horses had been ac cidentally poisoned and sought to reach a veterinary over defendants telephone line Plaintiff lived ten miles from the nearest town and the horses were so sick that he could not leave them and although he advised the operator of the urgency of his call and tried repeatedly it was twelve hours before he could obtain medical aid and the horses died It was shown that one of the veterinarians was in his office for four hours during the time plaintiff was calling and would have answered the call at once if he had received it Plaintiff brought an action for the loss of the horses alleging that in all reasonable probability the horses could have been saved with prompt medical attention The defendant demurred generally Held averment is not so uncertain and conjectural as to be demurrable but the question is one of fact for the jury Peterson v Monroe Independent Telephone Co Neb 182 N W 1017 Telegraph and telephone companies are not held to the strict lia bility of common carriers and are consequently not insurers of the safety of transmission of messages Primrose v Western Union Tel Co 154 U S 1 But they are liable for such damages and only such as naturally and proximately result from their negligent performance of their duty as to the transmission and delivery of messages Western Union Tel Co v Schriver 141 Fed 538 4 L R A N Sl 678 Hall v Western Union Tel Co 59 Fla 275 51 So 819 27 L R A N S 639 It is very often on account of the failure to show that the loss or damage is the natural and proximate result of the telegraph or telephone companys negligence that the courts refuse to hold the

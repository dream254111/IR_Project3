his life and to quote the language of the of ficial dispatch to use every endeavor to have them treated as out laws by the Governments of all civilized nations and that no place of refuge shall be

communities before law and order were fully established In the absence of any international Court with power at its disposal to hale offending members of foreign Governments before it and administer punishment the last resort is outlawry just as outlawry was the last weapon of ancient law As has been well said it was the sentence of death pronounced by a community which had no police constables

happiness is the chief end of human existence It is the will of God as indicated by the mental moral and physical con stitution of man and his position in the scale of creation and as we are plainly taught in His revealed word it is the great object of all political and social organizations In all the various stations of social life there is not one that does not profess to be promotive to this great end Among them all the marriage relations occupies by the common consent of mankind and by the human and Divine law the post of honor as being more promotive than any other of the highest happiness of the individual Man then was not made that he might marry but made that he might be happy Happiness is the great end and marriage only the means Listening to some of the modern rhodomontades upon the indissolubility of the mar riage relation one would suppose that the Bible and the common 1919  791 MISCELLANY792 4 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb sense of mankind had been all along wrong and that mans chief end is to marry and that all other things are to be sacrificed in order that this relation may be maintained indissoluble The individual is under the highest possible moral obligation to pursue his substantial happiness He has no moral right to wantonly mar that happiness whilst he cannot promote it at the sacrifice of the right or happiness of others yet he is bound to pursue it in de spite of all hindrances when those hindrances are neither the result of his own culpability nor of such a character as to render obedience to them of higher moral obligation From these principles that as the marriage relation is only the means to attain the end individ ual happiness whenever it ceases to be promotive of that end and en tails misery and that without the fault of the suffering party it should in pure morality be dissolved I admit the obligations to society and am willing to give them due force but society becomes a tyrant whose exacting behests transcend the rules of all sound morality and the laws and instincts of nature itself when it de mands of the innocent the sacrifice of the great end of existence all that makes existence desirablefor the contemptible purpose of preserving inviolate one of the hundred means for the accomplish ment of that end or for the yet more ignoble purpose of minister ing to the prejudices of a mistaken zeal

slight grounds The abuse of this privilege disgusted the early Christians who as was natural fell into the opposite error The Catholic Church which prevailed throughout Europe during the middle and dark ages forbid divorce but the Reformation originated a more sound philosophy on this subject which has gradually enlarged the grounds for divorce in general in exact ratio with the spread of a liberalized Christianity and a more thorough understanding of human rights This old time Texas lawyer referred to the ancient tyrant who as a refinement in cruelty was accustomed to attach to the person of every malefactor a dead human body that he might ever have beneath his vision its gradual and loathsome decay and have its1919  MISCELLANY 793 fetid stench forever in his nostrils And then by way of com parison he said that more refined in cruelty than the ancients is the power that would tie a loathsome moral carcass to the body of an innocent and feeble woman where she may forever

600 59 So 438 an action against a carrier for the wrongful death of a passenger it appeared in evidence that the intestate an aged man between 65 and 75 years old lame ini one arm or shoulder from a Civil War wound also lame in one leg and in an enfeebled condition while encumbered with bundles or packages consisting of two quarts of whiskey bananas etc which he carried in a sack or sacks stepped off of a moving train against the protest of defend ants flagman who offered to stop the train The Supreme Court of Alabama held that it was reversible error to refuse an instruction that the plaintiff could not recover if the jury believed such evi dence The requested instruction told the jury that in such case the intestate assumed all risk of injury This seems inaccurate The doctrine really invoked was that of contributory negligence which is the failure to exercise that degree of care which a man of ordinary prudence would exercise under like circumstances It may be safely asserted that the average citizen in this Commonwealth would not be reckless enough to alight from a moving train with even one quart in his possession in the absence of pursuit or cir cumstances creating an emergency not to mention the intestates physical handicap The Faithful and Eccentric MuleIn Stewart v Smith 78 So 724 725 the Court of Appeals of Alabama per Bricken J said The characteristics and propensities of the faithful but eccentric mule are sufficiently well known for us to say that a body and mind at have become overwhelmed by the effects of alcohol are in no condition to foil such animals fancies or to curb its sometimes dis astrous ambitions Mouse as an Article of DietIn these days of food conservation we naturally attach considerable importance to any decision of our courts which tends to establish or to clarify the law as to what is or is not a proper article of diet We have therefore read with con siderable interest a recent decision of the Appellate Division of the First Department which establishes as the law of this State that mouse can not be regarded as proper food for a human being Bar rington v Hotel Astor Company Inc N Y Law Journal July 23794 4 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb 1918 The distressing circumstances out of which the litigation arose are stated by Justice Dowling delivering the opinion in which all of the justices concurred as follows On August 3 1916 the plaintiff registered as a guest at the Ho tel Astor in the city of New York at about 4 oclock in the after noon and at about 8 oclock in the evening went into the restau rant of the said hotel and gave an order for liquor and for food which included kidney saute After the lapse of some time the food ordered was brought to him and after he had eaten part of the saute and was about to transfer some more from the casserole in which it was contained to his plate he found half a mouse included in the part so transferred and the other half still in the casserole The mouse gave evidence of having been chopped in two and as soon as the plaintiff discovered the unexpected addition to his order he became violently sick and remained so for some weeks and suf fered illness and other discomforts as the result thereof including a pronounced loss of appetite The defense was ingenious The defendant did not deny the pres ence of the mouse in the saute but devoted its efforts to showing that the only possible explanation was that plaintiff who was an actor and who was at the time seeking employment in the moving picture business had really placed the mouse in the dish himself or hae so acted after having brought the mouse in with him as to cause it to appear that he had taken it from the dish Difficulty was encoun tered in determining whether or not the mouse when found in the dish was cooked or in its natural state mainly for the reason that one of the defendants waiters ate the remainder of the saute before his attention was drawn to the additional ingredient therein and the waiter was unable to testify whether or not he ate any remaining part of the mouse It did not appear that the waiter suffered any ill results from his feast The jury found upon the conflicting evidence that the mouse was in the dish when it was placed before the plain tiff and had been in some way introduced therein during the progress of the food in the defendants kitchen The trial judge however dis regarded the verdict of the jury and dismissed the complaint for the reason that in his opinion there was no implied warranty that the food served to plaintiff was wholesome and contained no substance unsuitable for food or that it was the food ordered The Appellate Division was of different opinion nor did it ap parently consider the abstract question of the wholesomeness of the mouse as important but disposed of this aspect of the case very briefly as follows While neither of the medical experts produced testified that the flesh of a mouse is dangerous to health when eaten yet the preju dice which still exists against that form of food sufficiently explains1919  MISCELLANY 795 the consequences which ensued to plaintiff from his consumption of it The view of the higher court was that Race v Krum 222 N Y 410 which has been recently discussed in Bench and Bar 12 Bench and Bar New Series 506 April 1918 was a controlling authority After reviewing that case the Appellate Division said The hotel itself prepared this dish and has sole control thereof from the selection of the uncooked ingredients to the final placing of the prepared food before the plaintiff for consumption A guest at a hotel who orders a portion of kidney saute has the right to ex pect and the hotelkeeper impliedly warrants that such dish will con tain no ingredients beyond those ordinarily placed therein The ho telkeeper also impliedly warrants that the dish is wholesome and fit for human consumption and contains nothing rendering it un suitable for use as human food The defendant does not seek to justify the inclusion of the mouse in this dish as any proper part of its menu Considerable significance must be attached to this further thought of the Appellate Division In a reputable hotel the guest has a right to assume that the food which is placed before him is fit for him to eat That is why he pays the charges which are prevalent in restaurants of any stand ing We confess to a considerable degree of satisfaction with this de cision for our sympathies incline most strongly to the unfortunate plaintiff Wre have heard tales of the stranded actor being reduced to severe straits but we do not believe that his misfortunes should be aggravated by having to pay firstclass hotel prices for a mouse saute We shall follow the future progress of this case with considerable interest for it presents some unusual questions Is a mouse a proper article of food While we are told that the Chinese eat them the Court of Appeals of Georgia has called atten tion to that mental aversion which the Aryan race instinctively en tertains to ratty nourishment Martin v Waycross CocaCola Bot tling Co 18 Ga App 226 228 and our Appellate Division has re ferred in the Barrington case to the prejudice against that form of food In this aspect of the case it seems to us that the doctrine of freewill clearly entitles one to determine for himself whether or not he will partake of mouse We are also interested in the elements of damages The court states that the plaintiff in this case suffered a pronounced loss of appetite Is this a proper element of damages or could the de fendant in view of the fact that the plaintiff was an actor out of em ployment base a counterclaim thereon as for a benefit conferred The question of mental anguish is involved Would one suffer4 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S mental anguish as the result of eating a mouse or something which was flavored with dead mouse And would such mental anguish be a proper element of damages On this we have direct authority In Martin v Waycross CocaCola Bottling Co 18 Ga App 226 the court delivered itself of the following While under the rule announced in the Georgia case of Chap man v Western Union Telegraph Co 88 Ga 763 15 S E 901 30 Am St R 183 17 L R A 430 one could not recover for mental anguish due merely to extreme delicacy of taste or to wounded feel ing caused by the consciousness of having swallowed a liquid in which a dead mouse was in process of dissolution or for nausea pro duced entirely by that mental aversion which the Aryan race in stinctively entertains to ratty nourishment there is evidence from which the jury could have inferred that in this instance the liquid which was a blend of CocaCola and putrid mouse juice of itself caused the sickness from which the plaintiff testified she suffered and that she would have been made sick by it even if she had not seen that there was a decaying mouse in the bottle She testified that she took a large swallow before she saw the mouse and it is not as a matter of law to be concluded that the nausea from which she suffered was due to the mental shock caused by seeing a dead mouse in the liquid she was imbibing rather than that the nausea sickness and pain were primarily due to the poisonous nature of the hideous brew which her physical nature revolted against and at tempted to expel without her mind consciously becoming a collab orator in the effort and before the mind became a participant in the suffering 18 Ga App 228 We think that if such a case ever got to the jury they would be fairly certain to take the mental anguish of the plaintiff into con sideration and the court would be reluctant to upset their verdict Note the following language of the Georgia court We apprehend that the learned trial judge regarded the case as one in which the only suffering endured by the plaintiff was mental pain consequent upon the discovery of a rotten mouse in the bottle of CocaCola from which she was drinking If the evidence was subject to no other construction his judgment would undoubtedly be correct under the decision in Chapman v Western Union Tele graph Co supra but it is clear to our minds that there was suffi cient evidence in due accord with the petition to have authorized a jury to find that the physical sickness and physical pain of the plain tiff were caused by the physical effort to repel a poisonous fluid and for this reason we hold that the court erred in awarding a non suit If the plaintiff after having swallowed an unnatural and dele terious compound which necessarily was injurious to her body and which caused physical pain and sickness to her damage suffered additional mental pain which was consequent and directly depend 796  Febent upon her physical suffering this would merely aggravate the injury 18 Ga App 229 230 In our opinion while the evidence in the present case perhaps does not require a jury to find that the nature of the liquid sold by the defendant and swallowed by the plaintiff was the proximate cause of physical suffering and injury to her person it is sufficient to authorize such a finding 18 Ga App 229 In any event the inadvertent mouseeater need not be made crit ically ill in order to recover damages The fact that a particular plaintiff was sick only a short time or that no critica illness resulted from the negligence of the defend ant might minimize the damages recoverable but it would hardly so bring the case under a maxim de minimis non curat lex as to de prive the plaintiff of a right to recover That the plaintiff was cured of the effect caused by the rodent whose ghastly condition is por trayed in the testimony does not necessarily make this a case in which the Latin curat is synonymous with cure rat or rat cure 18 Ga App 229 It is possible though hardly probable that such a case might in volve a dispute as to the ownership of the dead mouse The gen eral rule is that the sale of a thing which without the knowledge of the seller contains something else concealed in it is not a sale of the latter thing 35 Cyc 61 The defendant hotel vigorously denied any intent to confer the mouse upon the plaintiff and hence if the mouse be regarded as a domesticated animal belonging to the ho tel it seems clear that the hotel did not pass title to the plaintiff by unwittingly including this household pet in the saute The hotels claim of continued ownership of the mouse notwithstanding its postmortem adventures would find further support in the case of Wiley v Slater 22 Barb 506 510 in which it was said obiter that where two dogs fought and one was killed the owner of the dead dog would I think be very clearly entitled to the skin although some less liberal would be disposed to award it as a trophy to the victor If however the mouse while in life was in its untamed state not reclaimed or domesticated by the hotel it would seem that plaintiff could assert title under the doctrine that findins is keepins relying upon Doodeward v Spence 6 Commonwealth Law Rep 406 where the High Court of Australia said that the dead body of an animal ferae naturae is not at death the property of anyone but may be appropriated by the finder Another question is how much care should one exercise to make sure that he does not partake of dead mouse This question was presented in the leading mouse case of Jackson CocaCola Bottling Co v Chapman 106 Miss 864 where counsel for the defendantap pellant earnestly argued We object to the instructions given in favor of appellee The 1919  797 MISCELLANY798 4 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER N S  Feb first instruction as shown on page 88 says in effect that if the jury believe that the beverage was bottled by defendant and placed on the market for sale while containing a dead rat the plaintiff was made sick by drinking then the verdict should be for the plaintiff Our objection to this instruction is that it leaves out of consideration the fact that the plaintiff should have exercised proper care at the time when drinking Certainly some obligation and requirement of pru dence must rest upon the plaintiff in a case like this There is no limitation in instruction to show that plaintiff him self should have exercised reasonable care and caution Suppose that in this case the plaintiff knowingly bought the stuff and drank it and so was made sick thereby should there be a recovery Suppose that the plaintiff willfully bought the concoction and got sick as a result should the jury award the verdict for the plaintiff 106 Miss 865866 This argument does not impress us nor did it appear to impress the court very strongly for the case was disposed of on its general merits as follows A sma mousie caused the trouble in this case The wee sleekit cowrin timrous beastie drowned in a bottle of CocaCola How it happened is not told There is evidence for appellant that its system for cleansing and filling bottles is complete and that there is watchfulness to prevent the introduction of foreign substances Nevertheless the little crea ture was in the bottle It had been there long enough to be swollen and undergoing decomposition when the bottle was purchased from the grocer and opened by appellee Its presence in the bottle was not discovered until appellee had taken several swallows An odor led to the discovery Further events need not be detailed Appellee says he got sick Suffice it to say he did not get joy from the an ticipated refreshing drink He was in the frame of mind to ap prove the poets words The best laid schemes o mice an men Gang aft aglay An leae us nought but grief an pain For promisd joy The record discloses sufficient evidence to sustain the jurys ver dict for appellee 106 Miss 868869 All these questions are novel and we await their solution with in terest although we hope most fervently that the New York restaura teurs will so conduct themselves that we shall not need a binding precedent establishing the rights and liabilities arising out of feeding mice to inadvertent guestsBench and Bar

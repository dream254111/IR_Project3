J100403,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW,1064012,THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA,I243774,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW VOL II MAY 1915 NO 8 THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA N MODERN TIMES THERE HAS BEEN A GENERAL DISPOSITION TO ANTEDATE BEYOND ALL SEEMING THE RISE OF FREE INSTITUTIONS IN THE HISTORY OF THE ANGLOSAXON RACE EVEN SO CONSERVATIVE A SCHOLAR AS STUBBS FINDS THAT OUR ANCESTORS WERE WEDDED TO THE PRACTICE OF DEMOCRACY WHILE THEY WERE STILL SKINCLAD NOMADS IN THE FORESTS OF NORTHERN EUROPE AND THE SAME WRITER DATES ELECTIVE REPRESENTATION FROM THE REIGN OF EDGAR BUT NOWHERE HAS THIS ANTEDATING TENDENCY APPEARED MORE STRONGLY AND UNI VERSALLY THAN IN THE INTERPRETATION OF MAGNIA CARTA AROUND THAT HISTORIC DOCUMENT A WEALTH OF TRADITION HAS GATHERED THOSE WHO FORCED IT UPON THE KING HAVE BEEN RE GARDED AS A BAND OF PATRIOTS SEEKING ONLY TO SAFEGUARD CONSTI TUTIONAL LIBERTY AGAINST THE ENCROACHMENTS OF ROYAL DESPOTISM ITS PROVISIONS ARE USUALLY SUPPOSED TO VIE WITH THOSE OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IN CONSTITUTING THE MOST POWERFUL ASSERTION OF POPULAR LIBERTIES IN THE FACE OF TYRANNY AND OPPRES SION THAT HAS BEEN MADE IN THE ENTIRE HISTORY OF THE RACE HAL LAM CALLS IT THE KEYSTONE OF ENGLISH LIBERTY OTHER WRITERS ARE EQUALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ALL THE OBJECTS FOR WHICH MEN NAT URALLY WISH TO LIVE IN A STATE OF SOCIETY WERE SETTLED IN ITS VARIOUS ARTICLES DE LOLME CONST OF ENG 276 THE WHOLE OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND IS LITTLE MORE THAN A COM MENTARY UPON MAGNA CARTA 1 STUBBS CONST HIST OF ENG 532 THE GREAT ACT AT RUNNYMEDE WAS IN THE FULLEST SENSE OF THE TERM A NATIONAL ACT AND NOT THE MERE ACT OF THE BARONAGE IN BEHALF OF THEIR SPECIAL PRIVILEGES 1 TAYLOR ORIGIN ANDVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW GROWTH OF ENG CONST 380 JUST WHAT MAGNA CARTA IS POP ULARLY SUPPOSED TO HAVE GAINED FOR INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY IS WELL SUMMED UP IN THE FOLLOWING FROM CREASY HIST OF ENG CONST 178 1 THE GOVERNMENT OF THE COUNTRY BY AN HEREDITARY SOV EREIGN RULING WITH LIMITED POWERS AND BOUND TO SUMMON AND CONSULT A PARLIAMENT OF THE WHOLE REALM COMPRISING HEREDITARY PEERS AND ELECTIVE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COM MONS 2 THAT WITHOUT THE SANCTION OF PARLIAMENT NO TAX OF ANY KIND CAN BE IMPOSED AND NO LAW CAN BE MADE REPEALED OR ALTERED 3 TRIAL BY JURY 4 THAT JUSTICE SHALL NOT BE SOLD OR DELAYED IT IS INTENDED IN THE PRESENT PAPER FIRST TO MAKE SOME IN QUIRY INTO THE HISTORICAL SETTING OF MAGNA CARTA SECOND TO EXAMINE THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF THE CHARTER AND DECIDE TO WHAT EXTENT THEY WILL BEAR THE CONSTRUCTION COMMONLY PUT UPON THEM AND THIRD TO ATTEMPT SOME CONCLUSION AS TO THE ACTUAL INFLUENCE WHICH THE CHARTER HAS EXERTED IN THE RISE OF CONSTI TUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IT IS A NOTORIOUS FACT THAT ON JUNE 15 1215 JOHN KING OF ENGLAND WITH A VERY POOR GRACE AND FOR NO BETTER REASON THAN THAT HE COULD NOT HELP HIMSELF AFFIXED HIS SEAL TO A CERTAIN DOC UMENT WHICH HAS SINCE BEEN KNOWN BY THE FAMOUS NAME OF MAGNA CARTA IT IS EQUALLY WELL KNOWN THAT THE GRANTING OF THIS CHARTER WAS THE OUTCOME OF A STRUGGLE BETWEEN THE PARTY OF THE KING UPON THE ONE HAND AND THE FEUDAL BARONAGE UPON THE OTHER A TRUE COMPREHENSION OF THE TERMS AND INTENT OF THE CHAR TER ITSELF THEN CAN HARDLY BE HOPED FOR UNLESS THE MAIN ISSUE IN THIS STRUGGLE IS FIRST CORRECTLY UNDERSTOOD AS A MATTER OF FACT THE AIMS OF THE BARONS HAVE IN MODERN TIMES BEEN FREQUENTLY MISCONCEIVED AND CONSIDERABLE UNDUE ELOQUENCE HAS BEEN LAV ISHED UPON THE DISINTERESTED CHARACTER OF THEIR MOTIVES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE YEAR 1215 THE ENGLISH STATE WAS IN A VERY REAL SENSE FEUDAL NOW IT CAN BE ASSERTED WITHOUT FEAR OF SUCCESSFUL CONTRADICTION THAT HISTORY AFFORDS NOT A SINGLE IN 566THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 567 STANCE OF ANY CLASS IN A FEUDAL STATE PUTTING FORTH AN EFFORT TO REMOVE THE POLITICAL DISABILITIES OF THE CLASSES BENEATH IT THE FEUDAL SYSTEM WAS CONSTRUCTED UPON A FRAMEWORK OF RIGIDLY SEPARATE CASTES LIKE THOSE OF INDIA AT THE PRESENT DAY AND BE TWEEN THESE CASTES WAS A GREAT GULF FIXED OF SPECIAL PRIVILEGE CLASSPRIVILEGE AND CLASSSELFISHNESS WERE THE VERY ESSENCE OF IT AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY WAS ITS EXACT CONTRADICTORY FEUDAL GOV ERNMENT WAS GOVERNMENT BY RIGHT OF CLASS IRRESPECTIVE OF THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IS GOVERN MENT BY THE EXPRESS CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED CLEARLY THESE TWO FORMS ARE AS FAR REMOVED IN PRINCIPLE AS THE POLES CONSE QUENTLY IF THE BARONAGE IN THE YEAR 1215 WERE ATTACKING SPECIAL PRIVILEGE THEY WERE STORMING THEIR OWN CITADEL WHAT THEN WAS THE REAL POINT AT ISSUE IN THE CONFLICT THIS QUESTION CAN BE BRIEFLY AND CLEARLY ANSWERED WHAT THE BARONS WANTED WAS A SURER RIGHT TO DICTATE TO THE CROWN IN MATTERS OF GOVERNMENT AND MAGNA CARTA IS THE RECORD OF THE MEASURES WHICH THEY TOOK TO SECURE THAT RIGHT THIS REALLY AMOUNTS TO A QUESTION OF THE PERSONNEL OF THE KINGS COUNCIL OR TO USE THE CONTEMPORARY TERM THE CURIA REGIS THE CURIA REGIS OF THE TIME UNITED IN ITSELF WITHOUT DIFFERENTIATION THE EXECUTIVE LEGISLATIVE AND JUDICIAL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND HENCE THOSE WHO SAT IN IT WERE THE RULERS OF ENGLAND AND OF ALL THE OTHER POSSESSIONS OF THE BRITISH CROWN NOW THE CURIA REGIS CONSISTED OF TWO ELEMENTS FIRST THE BARONAGE OR TENANTS IN CAPITE OF THE CROWN THESE SAT BY VIRTUE OF THEIR RIGHT BALDWIN THE KINGS COUNCIL PASSIM TO DO SO ON THE FEUDAL PRINCIPLE THAT A VASSAL SHOULD GIVE AID AND COUNSEL TO HIS LORD AND MET ONLY ON FIXED AND COMPARATIVELY RARE OCCASIONS IN PRACTICE ONLY THE GREAT LORDS MAJORES BARONES ATTENDED TO THE SIMPLE KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES ATTEND ANCE WAS BOTH BURDENSOME AND BOOTLESS AND HENCE THEY HABIT UALLY ABSENTED THEMSELVES THE SECOND ELEMENT WAS COMPOSED OF THE KINGS CHOSEN OFFICIALS AND MINISTERS AND THESE SAT MORE CONTINUOUSLY AND BY COMMAND NOT BY RIGHT FURTHERMORE THESE WERE USUALLY NOT TENANTS IN CAPITE SINCE THE KING WOULD WANT FOR THESE POSITIONS MEN UPON WHOM HE COULD RELY ABSO LUTELY WHOSE PRIVATE INTERESTS WOULD NOT LEAD COUNTER TO THEIRVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW DUTY TO HIM HENCE THESE OFFICIALS WERE USUALLY PRIESTS CLERKS OR FOREIGNERSPERSONS NOT POSSESSED OF GREAT PRIVATE INTERESTS IN ENGLAND THIS SECOND ELEMENT DATED ONLY FROM THE REIGN OF HENRY II AS WOULD BE EXPECTED CONSIDERABLE JEALOUSY OF THESE NEW COMERS SOON AROSE ON THE PART OF THE BARONAGE A JEALOUSY WHICH BECAME THE GREATER AND THE MORE FREELY EXPRESSED AS IT GREW MORE AND MORE EVIDENT THAT THE GOVERNMENT OF ENGLAND WAS TENDING TO CHANGE FROM AN ARISTOCRACY TO A BUREAUCRACY AC CORDINGLY IT IS FROM THIS TIME THAT WE FIRST HEAR TALK OF EVIL COUNSELORS FOREIGNBORN MINISTERS AND FAVORITES THESE EPITHETS WERE MERELY TERMS APPLIED BY THE PARTY OF RIGHTTHE GREAT VASSALSTO THE PARTY OF COMMANDTHE BUREAUCRACY TWO EXAMPLES OUT OF MANY MUST SUFFICE MATT PARIS 231 A D 1211 HABUIT AUTEM REX HAC INTER DICTI TEMPESTATE CONSILIARIOS INIQUISSIMOS QUORUM NOMINA PRO PARTE HIC PONERE NON OMITTAM ETC THOSE WHOM THE WORTHY MATTHEW A STOUT BARONIAL PARTISAN ENUMERATES WERE ALL ROYAL OFFICIALS AND MEN OF OBSCURE OR FOREIGN ORIGIN FOR EXAMPLE GODFREY FITZHUGH THE JUSTICIAR RICHARD MARSHALL THE CHANCELLOR PETER DES ROCHES BISHOP OF WIN CHESTER ETC

CASE HAS SUFFERED HIS ANIMUS AGAINST THE KING TO LEAD HIM INTO UNREASON ABLY HARSH LANGUAGE FOR THESE BARBARI CAME FROM FRANCE WHICH AT THE TIME WAS CONSIDERABLY MORE HIGHLY CIVILIZED THAN ENGLAND INDEED IT MAY BE OBSERVED IN PASSING THAT MUCH OF THE BAD ODOR OF KING JOHN WITH POSTERITY HAS BEEN OWING TO THE FACT THAT ALL THE CHRONICLES OF THE TIME WERE WRITTEN BY PRIESTS AND MONKS TO WHOM OF COURSE A KING WHO HAD DEFIED THE POPE AND CONFISCATED THE POSSESSIONS OF HOLY CHURCH WAS AN ATHEMA SO HERE ARE THE LISTS SET ON THE ONE SIDE THE FEUDAL TENANTS IN CAPITE STRUGGLING TO SECURE AND EXTEND THEIR RIGHT TO CON 568THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 569 TROL THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE CURIA REGIS AND HENCE TO CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT ON THE OTHER THE CROWN WITH ITS BUREAUCRACY OF OFFICIALS STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN ITS POWER ABOVE THAT OF THE FEUDATORIES MAGNA CARTA MARKS ONLY THE FIRST SKIRMISH IN THIS BATTLEA BATTLE WHICH THE BARONAGE OFTEN WON AS OFTEN THROW ING AWAY THEIR VICTORY BY SLACKNESS IN ATTENDING THE COUNCIL AND WHICH DID NOT REACH ULTIMATE DECISION UNTIL THE DAYS OF THE TU DORS BUT THE POINT OF GREATEST IMPORTANCE IN THE PRESENT CON NECTION IS THAT THESE TWO WERE THE ONLY PARTIES TO THE STRUGGLE THE GREAT MASS OF THE PEOPLE WERE NEITHER CONCERNED NOR CON SIDERED THE GREAT CHARTER HAVING BEEN THUS CONSIDERED AS A SIGN OF THE TIMES IT NOW REMAINS TO EXAMINE ITS CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES AND CONSTRUE THEM IN THE LIGHT OF THE VIEWS JUST EXPRESSED THE CLAUSES WHICH HAVE BEEN SUPPOSED TO GUARANTY THE ESSENTIALS OF CONSTITUTIONAL LIBERTY ARE FOUR IN NUMBER AND

ITS NATURE CL 14 NO TAXATION OF ANY KIND WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THAT ASSEMBLY CL 12 TRIAL BY JURY CL 39 AND THAT JUDICIAL DECISIONS BE NOT PURCHASABLE CL 40 THESE FOUR POINTS WILL BE EXAMINED IN SOME DETAIL AND FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE IN THE REVERSE OF CREASYS ORDER NULLI VENDEMUS ETC THIS CLAUSE IS COMMONLY TAKEN TO IMPLY THAT IT HAD BEEN A PRACTICE OF THE KINGS COURTS OF LAW TO SELL THEIR DECISIONS AND THAT THE SUCCESSFUL PARTY TO A SUIT WON BY THE LENGTH OF HIS PURSE RATHER THAN BY THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF HIS CAUSE HENCE THIS CLAUSE IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE WROUGHT AN IMPORTANT REFORM BY PLACING RICH AND POOR UPON AN EQUALITY BEFORE THE ROYAL COURTS AND REMOVING THE WEIGHT OF GOLD WHICH HAD BEEN DISTURBING THE BALANCE OF THE SCALES OF JUSTICE BUT THERE IS MORE HERE THAN MEETS THE EYE THE ROYAL COURTS INITIATED BY HENRY II WERE THE MOST IMPORTANT AND FARREACH ING IF NOT THE MOST CONSPICUOUS MANIFESTATION OF THAT BUREAU CRACY WHICH HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY DWELT UPON IT MUST BE REMEM BERED THAT BEFORE THE INSTITUTION OF THESE COURTS THE LAW AND THE ADMINISTRATION THEREOF WERE ENTIRELY LOCAL EACH COUNTY HAD ITS COURT AND SO HAD EACH TOWNSHIP HUNDRED AND EACH MANOR AND THE LAW ADMINISTERED IN THESE COURTS CONSISTED OF THE FOLK LAW CALLED BY MAITLAND AN UNCOUTH TANGLE OF PRECEDENT AND CUGTOM WHICH MIGHT AND GENERALLY DID DIFFER FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND FROM HUNDRED TO HUNDRED THE MANORIAL COURT WAS ENTIRELY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LORD OF THE MANOR THE LORD HIMSELF OR HIS STEWARD ALWAYS PRESIDING AND FURTHERMORE BY THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THIS COURT HAD PRAC TICALLY ABSORBED THE HUNDRED COURTS THE COUNTY COURTS SHIRE MOOT WERE PRESIDED OVER BY THE SHERIFF VICECOMES WHO WAS USUALLY THE GREAT LORD OF THE COUNTY SO CLEARLY THE FEUDAL BARONAGE UNDER THIS SYSTEM WERE IN EFFICIENT CONTROL OF THE AD MINISTRATION OF JUSTICE AND OF THE PRESTIGE AND PROFITS ARISING THEREFROM BUT A GREAT AND TO THE BARONAGE MORTIFYING CHANGE IN THE ASPECT OF JUDICIAL AFFAIRS DATES FROM THE REIGN OF HENRY II 570THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 571 THAT GREAT CONSTITUTIONMAKER SET UP A SYSTEM OF ITINERANT JUDGES JUSTICES OF ASSIZE WHO WENT REGULARLY ON CIRCUIT AND TO THEM HE ANNEXED THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THE EXTEN SIVE JURISDICTION FORMERLY POSSESSED BY THE BARONIAL AND LOCAL COURTS BY THE GRAND ASSIZE THEY GOT JURISDICTION IN LAND CASES WHERE THE PARTIES WERE MILITARY TENANTS OF THE CROWN AND WERE IN POSSESSION BY THE THREE PETTY ASSIZESNOVEL DISSEISIN MORTE DANCESTER AND DARREIN PRESENTMENTJURISDICTION IN CASES WHERE THE PARTIES WERE NOT IN POSSESSION WAS ADDED SOLE JURISDICTION IN FELONY CASES WAS BESTOWED BY THE ASSIZE OF CLARENDONVICE COMITES ILLOS I E ROBATORES NMURDRATORES ETC DUCANT ANTE JUS TITIAS ART 4 IN PRACTICE THERE WERE VARIOUS CASES IN WHICH THESE ROYAL COURTS HAD CONCURRENT JURISDICTION WITH THE BARONIAL COURTS FINALLY THE POSITION OF THESE COURTS WAS MADE SECURE BY COMPELLING THE ATTENDANCE OF THE BARONS THEMSELVES EVEN THOUGH THE PARTICULAR BARON MIGHT HAVE A COURT OF HIS OWN NULLUS REMANEAT PRO LIBERTATE ALIQUA QUTAM HABEAT VEL CURIA VEL SOCA ASSIZE OF CLARENDON ART 8 THE OUTCOME OF ALL THIS WAS THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE ROYAL COURTS AND THE CONSEQUENT FEES INCREASED RAPIDLY IN VOLUME WHILE THE PROFITS OF THE LOCAL COURTS WERE CORRESPONDINGLY IN TRENCHED UPON INDEED THE ADVANTAGES AFFORDED BY THE FORMER WERE TOO OBVIOUS TO REMAIN LONG UNRECOGNIZED THE LAW WHICH THEY ADMINISTERED WAS UNIFORM NOT MERE VARYING LOCAL CUSTOM THEIR DECISIONS WERE SWIFT USUALLY UNBIASEDSINCE THE JUSTICE WOULD BE A STRANGER TO THE PARTIESAND WERE BASED UPON THE BEST EVIDENCE OBTAINABLE AS WILL APPEAR IN THE DISCUSSION OF TRIAL BY JURY THE NATURAL RESULT THEN WAS THAT THE BARONAGE VIEWED THE ROYAL COURTS WITH MUCH DISTASTE AND JEALOUSY AND IT IS IN THE LIGHT OF THESE FEELINGS THAT THE CLAUSE OF MAGNA CARTA UNDER CON SIDERATION MUST BE INTERPRETED WHEN THE BARONS FORCED KING JOHN TO PROMISE NULLI VENDEMUS ETC THEY WERE NOT REFERRING TO PRESENTS OR GRATUITIES RECEIVED BY THE ROYAL JUSTICES THOSE WHO HAVE SUPPOSED SO HAVE BEEN GUILTY OF ANACHRONISM BY IM PORTING INTO THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE SENSITIVE CONSCIENCE OF THE SEVENTEENTH IT WAS NOT UNTIL THE TIME OF LORD BACON THAT THE PRACTICE OF RECEIVING SUCH GRATUITIES ON THE PART OF THE JUDGESVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW WAS CHECKED THE REAL AIM OF THIS CLAUSE THEN WAS TO CUT OFF THE FAT FEES OF THE ROYAL COURTS IN THE LAND CASES HENRY II HAD OBLIGED THE BARONS TO COME TO HIS COURTS FOR JUSTICE AND TO PAY FOR IT BESIDES WHEREAS PREVIOUSLY THEY HAD GIVEN IT TO THEM SELVES IN THE LOCAL COURTS THEY NOW DETERMINED THAT IF THEY MUST COME TO THE KINGS COURTS AT LEAST THEY WOULD NO LONGER PAY FEES HENCE NULLI VENDEMUS ETC MEANS WE WILL NO LONGER CHARGE FEES IN OUR COURTS SO MUCH FOR CLAUSE 40 THE NEXT POINT TO BE CONSIDERED RELATES TO CLAUSE 39 AND THE IMPORTANT QUESTION OF TRIAL BY JURYNULLUS LIBER HOMO CAPIATUR ETC NISI PER LEGALE JUDICIUM PARIUM SUORUM THE FIRST QUESTION WHICH HERE ARISES IS WHO WAS A LIBER HOMO AT THIS POINT IT IS WELL TO PREFACE THAT THERE IS A VERY ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SIGNIFICATION OF LIBER AND LIBERTAS IN MONKISH LATIN AND THEIR CLASS ICAL MEANING IN MONKISH LATIN A LIBERTAS WAS A PRIVILEGE POS SESSED SPECIFICALLY BY SOME PERSON OR CLASS FROM THE ENJOYMENT OF WHICH OTHER PERSONS OR CLASSES WERE EXCLUDED ACCORDINGLY WHEN STEPHEN LANGTON IN THE YEAR 1213 GAVE ADVICE TO THE BAR ONAGE BY WHICH LIBERTATES DITL AMISSAS POTERITIS AD STATUM PRIS TINURN REVOCARE MATT PARIS 240 HE REFERRED TO THEIR PRIV ILEGES AS FEUDAL LORDS AND NOT TO THEIR NATURAL RIGHTS AS FREE BORN MEN GARDINER QUOTES AN APT CLAUSE FROM A MUNICIPAL PETITION OF ABOUT THIS PERIOD IN WHICH THE TOWN PROTESTS AGAINST THE ABOLITION OF ITS ANCIENT LIBERTAS TO PUT CULPRITS IN THE STOCKS A LIBER HOMO THEN WAS IN GENERAL A PERSON WHO POSSESSED A LIBERTAS OR SPECIAL PRIVILEGE IN PARTICULAR HE WAS A PERSON WHO HELD HIS LAND ON TERMS OF MILITARY TENURE LIBERUM TENE MENTULTN THAT IS QUIT OF ALL BURDENS EXCEPT THE DUTY TO RENDER MILITARY SERVICE TO THE CROWN WHEN REQUIRED THIS POINT IS MADE VERY CLEAR IN THE THIRD REISSUE OF THE CHARTER A D 1225 IN WHICH THIS CLAUSE IS CHANGED SO AS TO READ NULLUS ETC AUT DISSAISIETUR DE LIBERO TENEMENTO SUO ETC IN OTHER WORDS THE LIBERI HOMINLES WERE THE TENANTS IN CAPITE OF THE CROWN AND A FEW OTHERS WHO HELD A LIBERUM TENZEMENTUMN BY VIRTUE OF SOME SPECIAL GRANT OR CONCESSION DOMESDAY GIVES ONLY SOME 18000 LIBERI HOMINES OUT OF A TOTAL OF ABOUT 300000 MEN REPORTED ABOUT 6 PER CENT THIS PERCENTAGE DECREASED IF ANYTHING UP TO 572THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 573 THE TIME OF THE BLACK DEATH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENTURY IT IS INTERESTING TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT ALTHOUGH THE MUNICIPALITIES WERE DESTINED TO BECOME THE BIRTHPLACE OF CONSTI TUTIONAL GOVERNMENT THE BURGENSES MEN OF CORPORATE TOWNS WERE NOT YET AT THE TIME OF MAGNA CARTA CLASSIFIED AS LIBERI THEY WERE STILL SUBJECT TO CERTAIN SLIGHT THOUGH ANNOYING SERVICES IN VILLEINAGE SUCH AS MERCHET FINE PAYABLE TO LORD ON MARRIAGE OF DAUGHTER CHILDWITE FINE ON ILLEGITIMACY ETC THESE WERE SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE THE TOWNSMANS ESTATE TO BE HELD A VILLANUM TENEMENTUM THE EFFECT OF THE FOREGOING IS TO SHOW THAT THE BENEFITS OF CLAUSE 39 WERE RESTRICTED TO A NUMERICALLY INSIGNIFICANT FRACTION OF THE POPULATION AND THAT FRACTION WAS MOSTLY COMPOSED OF OUR OLD FRIENDS THE TENANTS IN CAPITC OF THE CROWN THE CLAUSE GAVE NO PROTECTION TO TENANTS IN MESNE TENANTS IN SOCAGE TEN ANTS IN FRANCALMOIGN TENANTS IN VILLEINAGE AND ALL THE OTHER CLASSES IN THAT QUEERLY COMPLEX FORM OF SOCIETY WHICH WE KNOW AS FEUDALISM CONSEQUENTLY IF THIS CLAUSE GAVE THE PROTECTION OF TRIAL BY JURY TO ANY CLASS IN ENGLAND IT GAVE IT TO THAT CLASS WHICH NEEDED PROTECTION LEAST OF ALL BY REASON OF ITS BEING BEST ABLE TO PROTECT ITSELF BUT TRIAL BY JURY IS ALWAYS CONSIDERED THE GREAT BULWARK OF POPULAR AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY HENCE HERE IS AL READY A STRONG PRESUMPTION AGAINST THIS CLAUSE OF MAGNA CARTA HAVING ANY REFERENCE TO TRIAL BY JURY IT MAY BE WELL TO SUM UP JUST HERE THE RESULT SO FAR REACHED IN THE INTERPRETATION OF THIS CLAUSE IT IS AS FOLLOWS WE WILL NOT THAT ANY TENANT IN CAPITE SUFFER ARREST IMPRISONMENT ETC EXCEPT BY THE LEGALE JUDICIUM PARIUM SUORUMN SO THE QUES TION NOW IS IN BRIEF THIS DOES JUDICIUM PARIUN MEAN TRIAL BY JURY AS CONTENDED BY CREASY AND OTHERS OR DOES IT NOT IT CAN BE POSITIVELY REPLIED THAT JUDICIUT PARIUM DOES NOT MEAN TRIAL BY JURY SINCE IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE OF PROOF THAT NO SUCH THING AS TRIAL BY JURY EXISTED IN THE PERIOD UNDER EXAMINATION OR FOR THAT MATTER FOR FULLY TWO CENTURIES THEREAFTER IN ORIGIN THE JURY IS FRANKISH WHEN A FRANKISH RULER DE SIRED INFORMATION ON SOME PARTICULAR LOCAL MATTER FOR EXAMPLE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES WHICH THE LOCALITY COULD PAY HE SENT HISVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW OFFICIAL THERE WHO GATHERED SEVERAL OF THE LOCAL MEN OF KNOWN RESPONSIBLE CHARACTER PUT THEM ON THEIR OATH TO TELL THE TRUTH AND THUS EXTRACTED THE DESIRED INFORMATION BY THE TIME OF THE CONQUEST THIS PRACTICE WAS VERY GENERAL IN FRANCE AND THE CON QUEROR BROUGHT IT WITH HIM TO ENGLAND THE FIRST RECORDED EX AMPLE OF THE USE OF THE JURY JURATIMEN WHO HAVE TAKEN AN OATH IN ENGLAND WAS IN THE COLLECTION OF DATA FOR COMPILING THE DOMESDAY BOOK THE INTRODUCTION OF THE TESTIMONY OF THIS BODY OF SWORN MEN INTO THE COURTS OF LAW WAS ANOTHER OF THE INNOVATIONS OF HENRY II HE DIRECTED ASSIZE OF CLARENDON ART 1 THAT HIS JUSTICES ON CIRCUIT SHOULD INQUIRE IN EVERY LOCALITY PER XII LEGALIORES HOMINES DE HUNDREDO ET PER IV LEGALIORES HOMINES DE QUALIBET VILLATA PER SACRAMENTUMR QUOD VERUM DICENT WHETHER THERE WERE IN THAT LOCALITY ANY KNOWN FELONS THIS JURY CAME TO BE KNOWN AS THE JURY OF PRESENTMENT BECAUSE IT PRESENTED THE CRIMINALS TO THE COURTS AND THE MODERN GRAND JURY IS ITS DIRECT DESCENDANT THE JURY WAS A FEW YEARS LATER INTRODUCED BY THE SAME RULER INTO CIVIL CASES ALSO BY THE PETTY ASSIZE OF MORTE DANCESTER IN WHICH IT WAS PROVIDED THAT IF AN HEIR COM PLAINED THAT HE WAS EXCLUDED FROM HIS DUE INHERITANCE THE KINGS JUSTICE SHOULD TAKE PERCOGNITIONEM PER DUODECIM LEGALES HOMN INES QUALEM SAISINAM DEFUNCTUS INDE HABUIT DIE QUA FUIT VIVUS ET NORTUUS ASSIZE OF NORTHAMPTON ART 4 THESE WERE THE ONLY USES OF THE JURY IN THE COURTS OF LAW AT THE TIME MAGNA CARTA WAS GRANTED CLEARLY THEN BY NO STRAINING OF LANGUAGE COULD EITHER OF THESE BE CALLED TRIAL BY JURY THE SOLE DUTY OF THE JURY HERE WAS TO GIVE INFORMATION TO THE KINGS JUDGES REGARDING THE FACTS OF THE CASE SO THAT THE JUDGES COULD REACH A CORRECT DE CISION IN OTHER WORDS THESE JURORS WERE CHOSEN WITNESSES PURE AND SIMPLE THE FORM OF THEIR OATH SHOWS CLEARLY ENOUGH THAT THEIR SOLE OFFICE WAS TO TESTIFY AS TO THE FACTS FOLLOWING ARE SEVERAL STATEMENTS OF THE OATH TAKEN FROM DIFFERENT AUTHOR ITIES IN THIS PERIOD QUOD INDE VERITATEM

ET HCAC SANCTA BRACTON LIB 4 C 19 FOL 184BA D 1250 GLANVILS ACCOUNT IS VERY NEARLY CONTEMPORARY AND HE DESCRIBES THE PROCESS OF AFFORCING THE JURY THAT IS WEEDING OUT THOSE JURORS WHO HAD NOT THE REQUISITE KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS OF THE CASE AT BAR DONEC TALES INVENIANTUR QUI REI VERITATEM INDE SCIERINT IT IS NOT NECESSARY THEN TO LABOR THIS POINT FURTHER SINCE IT IS SUFFICIENTLY OBVIOUS THAT IN NO SENSE HAD THE JURORS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY THE RIGHT TO TRY THE CASE OR TO PRONOUNCE ANY MANNER OF DECISION WHATEVER THE DECISION WAS GIVEN BY THE KINGS JUDGES IN THE LIGHT OF THE TESTIMONY OF THE JURY CON SEQUENTLY THE DIRECT AND INEVITABLE RESULT IS THAT SINCE THE JURY COULD NOT PRONOUNCE A JUDICIUM THEN JUDICIUM PARIUM WHATEVER IT WAS WAS NOT AND COULD NOT POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN TRIAL BY JURY THE QUESTION AS TO WHAT JUDICIUM PARIUM ACTUALLY WAS IS EASILY ENOUGH ANSWERED IT IS MERELY THE OLD MATTER OT ARISTOC RACYS JEALOUSLY OF BUREAUCRACY AS WAS PREVIOUSLY SEEN THE MINISTERS OF THE CROWN AT THIS TIME WERE USUALLY MEN OF OBSCURE ORIGIN AND WERE NOT CHOSEN FROM THE NUMBERS OF THE TENANTS IN CAPITE THE BARONAGE FELT IT AS AN AFFRONT THAT DECISIONS IN VOLVING THEIR PERSONS AND PROPERTY SHOULD BE PRONOUNCED BY JUDGES BELONGING TO A LOWER FEUDAL CASTE FURTHERMORE THE KINGS JUDGES AS HAS BEEN ALSO SEEN WERE APT TO BE IMPARTIAL AND WERE NOT USUALLY WONT TO SHOW THE NOBLE SUITOR THAT SPECIAL CONSIDERATION WHICH HE WOULD FEEL THAT HIS RANK DEMANDED IN DEED THE JUDGES MAY WELL HAVE RETURNED THE JEALOUSLY OF THE ARISTOCRATS AND ON OCCASION MAY HAVE BEEN VINDICTIVE JUDI CIUM PARIUM THEN SIMPLY MEANT JUDGMENT BY MEMBERS OF THE SAME FEUDAL CASTE IN BRIEF THEN THE MEANING OF CLAUSE 39 IS AS FOLLOWS THE KINGS JUSTICES SHALL NOT DECIDE CRIMINAL CASES WHERE A TENANT IN CAPITE IS THE DEFENDANT UNLESS SAID JUSTICES BE ALSO OF BARONIAL RANK THIS CLAUSE IS STILL THE LAW IN ENGLAND WHERE A PEER HAS THE RIGHT TO DEMAND TRIAL BEFORE THE HOUSE OF LORDS TO THIS DAY BUT CLEARLY ALL THIS IS VERY REMOTE FROM TRIAL BY JURYVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW THE THIRD OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES IS CLAUSE 12 INVOLVING THE QUESTION OF TAXATION BY CONSENT  NULTUM SCUTAGIUM VEL AUXZILIUM ETC NISI PER COMMUNE CONSILILUM REGNI NOSTRZ ETC AS HAS BEEN POINTED OUT THIS CLAUSE IS COMMONLY HELD TO HAVE PROVIDED THAT NO TAX OF ANY KIND BE LAID WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF A PARLIAMENT IN WHICH SAT HEREDITARY PEERS AND ELECTIVE REPRE SENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE AT LARGE BUT IT CAN BE SHOWN THAT NO SUCH GENERAL PROVISION WAS INTENDED THE DECISIVE QUESTION IS AS TO THE MEANING OF THE TERMS SCUTAGIUM AND AUXILIUMN SCUTAGIUM PRESENTS NO ESPECIAL DIFFICULTY IT WAS SIMPLY A SUM PAID BY A LIBER HOMO IN COMMUTATION OF THE MILITARY SERV ICE WHICH HE OWED TO THE CROWN WHEN THE KING WAS ABOUT TO EMBARK UPON A MILITARY ENTERPRISE OF SOME KIND AND LACKED THE NECESSARY FUNDS HE DECLARED A SCUTAGE OF SO MUCH ON THE KNIGHTS FEE FIVE HIDES OF FREEHOLD LAND EVERY LIBER HOMO WHO DID NOT THEN JOIN THE ROYAL FORCES WITH ALL THE KNIGHTS DUE FROM HIS HOLDING PAID THIS SUM FOR EACH KNIGHT WHICH HE FAILED TO FURNISH UNDER HENRY II THIS METHOD OF RAISING MONEY AROUSED NO ESPECIAL OPPOSITION SINCE THE KING WAS DISCREET BOTH AS TO THE FREQUENCY AND THE AMOUNTS OF THE SCUTAGES WHICH HE DECLARED BUT UNDER RICHARD AND STILL MORE UNDER THE CHRON ICALLY PENNILESS JOHN THE SCUTAGES ADVANCED STEADILY BOTH IN FREQUENCY AND IN AMOUNT UNTIL THEY WERE FELT AS A VERY REAL BUR DEN AND THE BARONAGE GREW RESTIVE ESPECIALLY SINCE UNDER JOHN THEY WERE NOT ALLOWED TO EXERCISE THEIR OPTION AND FIGHT INSTEAD OF PAYING IF THEY SO PREFERRED A FEW INSTANCES MAY BE GIVEN SHOWING VERY CLEARLY THE REASON WHY THE BARONAGE IMPOSED CLAUSE 12 UPON KING JOHN IN THE YEAR 1200 THE KING EXACTED A SCU TAGE OF TWO MARKS 26 SHILLINGS WHEN TWENTY SHILLINGS WAS THE MOST EVER EXACTED BEFORE RAD COGGESHALE 860 IN 1204 HE TOOK THE STILL HEAVIER ONE OF TWO AND ONEHALF MARKS MATT PARIS 209 IN 1205 HE TOOK WHAT THE GOOD MATTHEW CALLS PE CUNIAMN INFINITAM SO THIS ONE MUST HAVE BEEN HEAVIER YET MATT PARIS 212 ACCORDINGLY IT IS READILY SEEN WHY THE BARONAGE DESIRED TO IMPOSE A CHECK UPON THE TAKING OF SCUTAGES THE SCU TAGE THEN AFFECTED AND COULD AFFECT ONLY OUR OLD FRIENDS THE TENANTS IN CAPITE WHAT THEN WAS AN AUXILIUM HERE IS ANOTHER CASE SUCH 576THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 577 AS HAS BEEN ALREADY OBSERVED IN THE CASE OF THE WORDS LIBER AND LIBERTAS OF A VARIATION BETWEEN THE CLASSICAL AND MONKISH SIGNIFI CATION OF A LATIN WORD IN THE LATIN OF MAGNA CARTA AUXILIUM HAD NOT THE GENERAL MEANING WHICH IT POSSESSES IN CLASSICAL LITERA TURE BUT MEANT A FEUDAL AID NOW AN AID WAS A CONTRIBU TION IN MONEY FROM A FEUDAL VASSAL TO HIS LORD AND THE ORIGINAL PRINCIPLE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN VAGUELY TO THE EFFECT THAT THE LORD COULD DEMAND SUCH A CONTRIBUTION AT ALMOST ANY TIME THAT HE FELT HIMSELF SHORT OF FUNDS BUT IN ENGLAND THE RULE HAD AL WAYS BEEN THAT THE AID WAS TO BE EXACTED ONLY ON OCCASIONS OF UNCOMMON NECESSITY THREE SUCH OCCASIONS HAD IN THE COURSE OF TIME COME BY CUSTOM TO BE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED THESE AS SPECIFIED IN THE CLAUSE UNDER CONSIDERATION WERE RANSOMING THE LORDS BODY FROM CAPTIVITY KNIGHTING HIS ELDEST SON PUR FERE FITZCHIVALER AND MARRYING HIS ELDEST DAUGHTER ONCE PUR FILLE MARIER HENCE CLAUSE 12 OF THE CHAPTER PROVIDES IN THE LIGHT OF THE EXPLANATION JUST MADE THAT EXCEPT FOR THESE THREE SPECIFIC AIDS THE KING SHALL EXACT NO AID OR SCUTAGE FROM HIS FEUDAL VASSALS WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE COMMUNE CONSILIUM REGNI THE EXAMINATION OF THE PHRASE CONZZMUNE CONSILILUM REGNI WILL BE RESERVED UNTIL THE DISCUSSION OF CLAUSE 14 THE POINT OF PRESENT IMPORTANCE IS THAT CLAUSE 12 LIKE CLAUSE 39 APPLIES ONLY TO THE FEUDAL VASSALS OF THE CROWN OUR FAMILIAR FRIENDS THE TENANTS IN CAPITE WHO THUS AS WE HAVE COME TO EX PECT ARE AGAIN FOUND LOOKING OUT FOR THEIR OWN INTERESTS AND ONLY FOR THEIR OWN CONSEQUENTLY THIS CLAUSE IS VERY FAR FROM AFFORDING THAT UNI VERSAL PROTECTION AGAINST ARBITRARY TAXATION WHICH MANY HAVE FANCIED THEY DISCERNED IN IT NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTA TION WAS A SLOGAN OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY NOT OF THE THIR TEENTH THE KING MIGHT STILL MAKE EXACTIONS FROM ALL THE CASTES OF THE FEUDAL STATE BELOW THE HIGHEST HENCE PURVEYANCE TALLAGE THIRTEENTHS ETC COULD BE LEVIED AS BEFORE AT THE KINGS WILL OF THESE THE CASE OF TALLAGE IS ESPECIALLY INTEREST ING TO MODERN OBSERVERS BECAUSE IT FELL UPON THE TOWNS WHENCE AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY REMARKED CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT WAS DESTINED ULTIMATELY TO SPREAD TO THE CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION BOTH THE AMOUNT OF THIS TAX AND THE FREQUENCY OF ITS IMPOSITION WERE 2VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW MATTERS SOLELY FOR THE ROYAL DISCRETION AND THAT THIS CONTINUED TO BE THE CASE AFTER THE YEAR 1215 IS READILY SHOWN BY QUOTA TIONS FROM THE CHRONICLES THUS WE READ IN THE ANNALS OF THEOKESBURY UNDER THE YEAR 1225 THAT REX GRAVE TALLAGIUM CEPIT SUPER SINGULOS DIVITES CIVES ET BURGENSES THOMAS WYKES RELATES THAT IN THE YEAR 1234 REX HENRICUS FECIT TALLIARI OMNES CIVITATES ET BURGOS PER TOTAM ANGLIAM THE ARBITRARY CHARAC TER OF TALLAGE IS SO WELL ILLUSTRATED BY A PASSAGE FROM MATTHEW PARIS UNDER THE YEAR 1243 THAT LEAVE IS TAKEN TO QUOTE IT IN FULL CIVES LONDINSES AD GRAVISSIMAM COMPULSI SUNT REDEMPTIONEM QUAE TALLAGIUM DICITUR SUB HAC FORMA VENERUNT EXACTORES AD ILLUM VEL ILLUM CIVEM DICENTES TANTAM ET TANTAM OPORTET TE PECUNIAM DOMINO REGI PRO COMMODITATE REGNI MILITANTI ET SECUNDUM VOLUNTATEM ET AESTIMATIONEM EXTORTORUM PE CUNIAM CIVIUM MUTILARUNT CLAUSE 12 THEN WAS PURELY A BARONIAL PROVISION AND IF ANY FUR THER PROOF WERE NECESSARY IT WOULD APPEAR IN THE FACT THAT WHEN THE CHARTER WAS REISSUED IN 1216 JOHN BEING DEAD AND THE BARONAGE IN UNDISPUTED CONTROL OF AFFAIRS THIS CLAUSE WAS ALTO GETHER OMITTED IT WAS ALSO OMITTED FROM ALL SUBSEQUENT REIS SUES UNTIL THE YEAR 1297 WHEN IT APPEARED IN A FORM ESSENTIALLY DIFFERENT IN THE CONFIRMATIO CARTARUM AS TO THE MATTER OF TAXATION THEN THE IRRESISTIBLE CONCLUSION IS THAT MAGNA CARTA WAS VERY FAR FROM SETTING UP FOR THE NATION AT LARGE THE PRINCIPLE OF NO TAXATION WITHOUT CONSENT THERE NOW REMAINS FOR EXAMINATION ONLY THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER MAGNA CARTA PROVIDED FOR THE SITTING OF A PARLIA MENT THAT SHOULD BE IN ANY SENSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE WHOLE NATION AN INQUIRY INTO THE RISE OF REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT ENTER PROPERLY INTO THE PRESENT PAPER SINCE THE TIME OF ITS RISE WAS SUBSEQUENT TO THE PERIOD OF MAGNA CARTA IT IS SUFFICIENT HERE TO SHOW THAT THE CHARTER CONTAINS NO PROVISION FOR POPULAR REPRESENTATION IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SEEN THAT CLAUSE 12 PROVIDED THAT NO SCUTAGE OR AID BE IMPOSED WITHOUT THE CON SENT OF THE COMMUNE CONSILIUM REGNI IN CLAUSE 14 IT IS THEN EXPLAINED VERY PLAINLY AND PRECISELY JUST WHO THE PERSONS COM 578THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 579 POSING THIS COMMUNE CONSILIUM REGNI WERESO PLAINLY AND PRECISELY INDEED THAT IT IS DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND HOW EVEN THE WAYFARING MAN NOT TO MENTION CERTAIN SCHOLARS WHO HAVE WRIT TEN ON THE SUBJECT COULD EVER HAVE SO ERRED AS TO MISTAKE IT FOR A REPRESENTATIVE BODY THE CONSILIUM IS TO BE COMPOSED OF OMNES ILTOS QUI DE NOBIS TENENT IN CAPITE THE MAJORES BARO NES GREAT LORDS TO BE SUMMONED BY PERSONAL LETTER THE MINORES BARONES KNIGHTS AND SQUIRES BY A GENERAL NOTICE OF SUMMONS ADDRESSED TO THE SHERIFF OF EACH COUNTY EVERY MAN WAS TO ATTEND FOR HIMSELF IN HIS OWN RIGHT THERE IS NO MENTION OF REPRESENTATION INDEED THERE WAS NOBODY FOR THEM TO REPRE SENT THE SOLE OBJECT OF THE MEETING OF THE CONSILIUM WAS TO CONSENT TO THE IMPOSITION OF SCUTAGES AND AIDS AND AS HAS BEEN SEEN THESE TAXES FELL ONLY UPON THE TENANTS IN CAPITE ALL OF WHOM ACCORDING TO THIS CLAUSE HAD THE RIGHT TO ATTEND OBVIOUSLY WHEN ALL THOSE WHO WERE TO BE TAXED BY THE CONSILIUMN HAD THE RIGHT TO ATTEND THE CONSILIUM THERE WAS NOBODY LEFT TO BE REPRE SENTED THE FACT IS THAT THE CONSILIUM WAS COMPOSED ON PRECISELY THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS THE PRESENT HOUSE OF LORDS IT WAS MADE UP OF PEOPLE WHO ATTENDED BECAUSE THEY HAD A RIGHT TO DO SO AND WHO WERE REPRESENTATIVE OF NO ONE BUT THEMSELVES HERE IN DEED IS OUR LAST AND MOST CONSPICUOUS ILLUSTRATION OF THE FUNDA MENTAL DIVISION WITH WHICH THIS PAPER BEGAN ON THE ONE SIDE THE PARTY OF RIGHT ON THE OTHER THE PARTY OF COMMAND THE PROVISION MADE BY THIS CLAUSE IS EXACTLY WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTICIPATED FROM THE NATURE OF THE STRUGGLE COMMUNE CONSILIUM REGNI WAS NEITHER MORE NOR LESS THAN CURIA REGIS SIT TING FOR A SPECIFIC PURPOSE HENCE SINCE MAGNA CARTA MARKED A BARONIAL VICTORY AND SINCE ONE OF THE MAIN EFFORTS OF THE BARON AGE WAS TO CONTROL THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE CURIA REGIS EXCLUDING FROM IT ALL WHO WERE NOT TENANTS IN CAPITE WE SHOULD BE SURPRISED IF THE CHARTER DID NOT CONTAIN SOME SORT OF EXCLUSION MEASURE CLAUSE 14 IS JUST THAT MEASURE AND THOSE WHO HAVE FAILED TO REC OGNIZE THE FACT HAVE MISSED ITS ESSENTIAL SIGNIFICANCE THIS CLAUSE DID NOT THEN PROVIDE FOR A POPULAR BODY OR FOR ONE IN ANY SENSE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE PEOPLE ON THE CONTRARY ITS INTEN TION AND ITS EFFECT WERE TO PROVIDE FOR AN EXCLUSIVELY BARONIALVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW BODY IN WHICH NO FAVORITE OR EVIL COUNSELOR WOULD BE PER MITTED TO SIT THE CONCLUSION OF THE WHOLE MATTER THEN IS THAT MAGNA CARTA WAS A BARONIAL DOCUMENT A PIECE OF CLASS LEGISLATION IT WAS A LIST OF CONCESSIONS TO THE TENANTS IN CAPITE OF THE CROWN FOR THE CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIAL PRIVILEGES OF THEIR ORDER IT WAS NOT A NATIONAL DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE IT DID NOT CONTAIN ANY RECOGNITION OF POPULAR LIBERTIES IN FACT IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A FEUDAL PRONOUNCEMENT AND WAS APPLICABLE ONLY TO THE CONDI TIONS OF A FEUDAL STATE SUCH AS ENGLAND AT THE TIME WAS VIEWED IN ANY OTHER LIGHT IT IS MEANINGLESS UNLESS ITS FRAMERS WERE ALSO AMONG THE PROPHETS AND WERE LOOKING FORWARD ACROSS SOME FOUR CENTURIES TO THE TIME WHEN FEUDALISM SHOULD HAVE FALLEN INTO RUINS WHEN MONKISH LATIN SHOULD BE NEITHER SPOKEN NOR UNDER STOOD AND WHEN EVERY MAN SHOULD BE NOT ONLY FREE BUT INSISTENT UPON THE FACT OF HIS FREEDOM HAD MAGNA CARTA THEN NO VALUE IN THE SHAPING OF THE BRITISH CONSTITUTION DID IT AFFORD NO ASSISTANCE IN THE RISE OF FREE INSTITUTIONS THOSE WHO IMAGINE THAT BECAUSE IT DID NOT PRO VIDE ALL THE CONSTITUTIONAL SAFEGUARDS WHICH SUCCEEDING GENERA TIONS HAVE READ INTO IT THEREFORE IT HAS BEEN OF NO CONSTITUTIONAL VALUE ARE IN ERROR OF THE MOST SERIOUS CHARACTER THERE ARE AT LEAST TWO GENERAL RESPECTS IN WHICH MAGNA CARTA HAS BEEN OF IN CALCULABLE VALUE IN THE PROCESS OF SETTING UP FREE INSTITUTIONS THE FIRST OF THESE RESPECTS ARISES FROM THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CHARTERS GRANTING AS HAS BEEN SEEN IT WAS IMPOSED UPON A RELUCTANT KING BY A BODY OF HIS SUBJECTS IT WAS THUS A CODE OF RULES WHICH THE KING MUST OBEY WOULD HE WOULD HE NOT HENCE MAGNA CARTA INITIATED WHAT MODERN ENGLISHMEN ARE SO FOND OF REFERRING TO AS THE REIGN OF LAW AS POLLOCK PUTS IT IN BRIEF IT I E MAGNA CARTA MEANS THIS THAT THE KING IS AND SHALL BE BELOW THE LAW 1 POLLOCK  MAITLAND HIST OF ENG LAW 173 IN LATER TIMES WHEN THE FEUDAL POWER OF THE BARON AGE WAS BROKEN AND THE CROWN IN GREENS PHRASE TOWERED ALOFT IN SOLITARY GRANDEUR THIS IDEA WAS LITERALLY THE SOLE CHECK UPON ROYAL ABSOLUTISM MAGNA CARTA THEN WAS THE FIRST MILE STONE ON THE LONG ROAD LEADING TO THE ULTIMATE FIRM ESTABLISHMENT 580THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 581 OF THE SUPREMACY OF LAW IN ENGLAND UP TO THAT TIME THE KING HAD BEEN BOTH IN THEORY AND PRACTICE THE WIELDER OF THE LAW TO SUIT HIS INDIVIDUAL DESIRES THE KING GAVE THE LAW THE KING TOOK IT AWAY BLESSED BE THE NAME OF THE KING HE WAS A DESPOT AND HIS DESPOTIC RIGHT HAD IN NO RESPECT BEEN CHALLENGED BUT MAGNA CARTA WAS AN UNIMPEACHABLE RECORD ATTESTING THE FACT THAT THE CROWN WAS NO LONGER ABSOLUTE THAT WAS THE ROCK UPON WHICH THE CONSTITUTIONALISTS OF SUCCEEDING CENTURIES WERE TO FOUND AND BUILD THE STRUCTURE OF ANGLOSAXON LIBERTY BUT THE GREATEST CONSTITUTIONAL VALUE OF THE CHARTER HAS LAIN NOT IN ITS CONSTRUCTION BUT IN ITS MISCONSTRUCTION NOT IN WHAT IT REALLY MEANT BUT IN WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT IT MEANT CENTURIES LATER JENKS HIST OF ENG LAW AND MCKECHNIE MAGNA CARTA CONTEND THAT SINCE IT WAS ESSENTIALLY A FEUDAL AND REAC TIONARY DOCUMENT IT MUST THEREFORE HAVE BEEN AN ACTUAL HIN DRANCE TO CONSTITUTIONAL PROGRESS NOW THESE LEARNED GENTLE MEN ARE LAWYERS THEY KNOW WHAT MAGNA CARTA MEANT AND WHAT THE INTENTION OF ITS FRAMERS WAS THEY ARE ACCUSTOMED TO SEEING A LAW ADMINISTERED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTENTION OF THE LEG ISLATURE WHICH ENACTED IT BUT THEY FORGET THAT THE TRANSCENDENT PERIOD OF THE INFLUENCEOF MAGNA CARTA WAS NOT THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY BUT THE SEVENTEENTH AND THAT IT WAS THEN ADMINISTERED BY PEOPLE WHO DID NOT KNOW WHAT IT MEANT FEUDALISM WAS NOW A BYGONE SYSTEM THE RENAISSANCE HAD TORN AWAY THE CURTAIN OF THE DARK AGES WHICH HAD CONCEALED CICERO VIRGIL AND LIVY FROM THE SIGHT OF MEN AND LATIN WAS CLASSICAL ONCE MORE AUXILIUM LIBER AND PARES HAD THEIR VAGUE CLASSICAL SIGNIFICATIONS INSTEAD OF THEIR EXACT MONKISH ONES AND INTO THAT VAGUENESS MEN READ SUCH MEANINGS AS WERE DICTATED BY THEIR POLITICAL ASPIRATIONS THE OLD ENGLISH KINGSHIP WITH ITS TRADITION OF ABSOLUTISM WAS TOTTERING TO ITS FALL NOR ALL THE CRAFT OF JAMES NOR ALL THE STUBBORNNESS OF CHARLES COULD AVAIL TO SAVE IT ENGLAND WAS IN A FERMENT ON EVERY HAND COULD BE HEARD REVOLUTIONARY POLITICAL THEORIES AND MAGNA CARTA WAS CITED AS AUTHORITY FOR THEM ALL SHAKESPEARE NEVER HEARD OF MAGNA CARTA BUT A HALFCENTURY LATER THERE WAS HARDLY A VILLAGE BLACKSMITH BUT WOULD INTERPRET IT WITH FERVOR AS MACY SAYS ENG CONST 164 IT IS THE INDEFINITENESS OF SOME OF THE TERMS USED ANDVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW ESPECIALLY THE INDEFINITENESS OF SOME OF THE CLASSES TO WHICH THE TERMS REFER THAT HAS MADE IT EASY TO READ INTO MAGNA CARTA ALL THE IDEAL PRINCIPLES OF GOVERNMENT WHICH HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE SUCCEEDING CENTURIES    HENCE MAGNA CARTA BE ING IN ITS ORIGIN A CHARTER OF PRIVILEGES HAS BECOME THE GREAT CHARTER OF LIBERTIES IT IS HARDLY POSSIBLE FOR THE MODERN OBSERVER TO REALIZE THE REVERENCE WITH WHICH SEVENTEENTH CENTURY POLITICAL REFORMERS REGARDED THE CHARTER OR THE UNIVERSALITY OF APPLICATION WITH WHICH THEY INVESTED IT IT WAS APPEALED TO IN PRACTICALLY EVERY POLITICAL DISCUSSION OF THAT FEVERED PERIOD AND THERE IS HARDLY A DOCUMENT OF CONSTITUTIONAL IMPORTANCE BUT CONTAINS A REFER ENCE TO IT JOHN HAMPDEN REFUSED TO PAY SHIPMONEY AND WHEN PROSECUTED PLEADED MAGNA CARTA SAYING THAT SHIP MONEY WAS AN AUXILIUM AND SINCE PARLIAMENT HAD NOT CON SENTED TO IT THE KING COULD NOT LEGALLY LEVY IT 2 RUSHWORTH PARL HIST 481 SIR WALTER ERLE REFUSED TO LEND THE KING MONEY AND FOR HIS TEMERITY WAS ORDERED TO BE IMPRISONED WITH OUT TRIAL DURING THE KINGS PLEASURE IN THE HABEAS CORPUS PRO CEEDINGS WHICH FOLLOWED HIS COUNSEL SAID BY THE STATUTE SIC OF MAGNA CARTATHAT STATUTE IF IT WERE FULLY EXECUTED AS IT OUGHT TO BE EVERY MAN WOULD ENJOY HIS LIBERTY BETTER THAN HE DOTHIT APPEARS NULLUS LIBER ETC HE THEN COMPLAINS THAT THE CAREFUL SIR WALTER HAS NOT BEEN GIVEN A TRIAL BY JURY AS THUS GUARANTIED 3 STATE TRIALS 121 PARLIAMENT INVOKES MAGNA CARTA IN THE PETITION OF RIGHT WHEREAS NO MAN SHALL BE FOREJUDGED OF LIFE OR LIMB AGAINST THE FORM OF THE GREAT CHARTER    THEY I E PARLIAMENT DO HUMBLY PRAY THAT NO FREEMAN ETC 3 CAR I CAP 1 WHEN PARLIAMENT DE CIDED TO ABOLISH STAR CHAMBER THEY CITED MAGNA CARTA WHEREAS BY THE GREAT CHARTER MANY TIMES CONFIRMED IT IS EN ACTED THAT NO FREEMAN ETC    THEREFORE BE IT ENACTED THAT THE SAID COURT BE CLEARLY AND ABSOLUTELY DISSOLVED 17 CAR I CAP 10 THIS LAST BY THE WAY IS A PRETTY EXAMPLE OF THE IRONY OF FATE FOR STAR CHAMBER WAS WHAT WAS LEFT OF THE OLD CURIA REGIS AND HERE IS THE VERY DOCUMENT WHICH HAD BEEN IN TENDED TO PROTECT THE CURIA REGIS CITED AS AUTHORITY FOR ITS DE STRUCTION 582THE CONSTITUTIONAL CLAUSES OF MAGNA CARTA 583 NO FURTHER EXAMPLES NEED BE GIVEN THOUGH THEY COULD BE MULTIPLIED INDEFINITELY TO SHOW THE IMMENSE INFLUENCE EXERTED BY MAGNA CARTA DURING THE PERIOD OF THE PURITAN REVOLUTION EVERYWHERE WAS MAGNA CARTA MAGNA CARTA MEN EXALTED IT INTO A DOCUMENT OF BLOOD AND FIRE IN DEFENSE OF ITS PRINCIPLES THEY MARCHED THE LENGTH AND BREADTH OF ENGLAND IN THE RANKS OF FAIRFAX AND CROMWELL THEY DIED FOR IT AT NASEBY MARSTON MOOR AND WORCESTER IN THE END THEY SACRIFICED THEIR KING TO IT SO THE CONCLUSION IS THAT THOUGH MAGNA CARTA DID NOT MEAN TRIAL BY JURY NOR REPRESENTATIVE GOVERNMENT NOR TAXATION ONLY BY POPULAR CONSENT AT THE TIME IT WAS GRANTED IT MEANS ALL THESE THINGS NOW AND HAS MEANT THEM FOR THREE CENTURIES BY ITS VERY MISCONSTRUCTION IT HAS PUT FORTH A POWER IN SHAPING THE DESTINIES OF A GREAT RACE BEYOND THAT OF ANY OTHER DOCUMENT EVER PENNED WILLIAM A STUART UNIVERSITY VA

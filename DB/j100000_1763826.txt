27 does not fully correspond to the present state of our knowledge Therefore we reproduce in the present number the part in which the most important discoveries have been made corrected to date The Mongala and the tributaries of the Obangi are drawn more accuratelyfrom new maps published by the Aqov7ve mentgeograj5hZze but the most remarkable features of the new map are the discoveries of Giacomo de Brazza in the region be tween the Obangi and Ogove which were published in the Bulletin of the Italian Geographical Society Though it is more than a year since this traveller returned from his journey the map has been published only now but as it is not based on the longitudes of Captain Rouvier the positions had to be corrected accordingly De Brazza started from the upper Ogove First he made several short excursions in the region between the upper Ogove and the the MozvemerGgeograpAzze that Captain van Gle has ascended the Lopuri the tributary of the Lulongo The upper part of this river runs in a northwesterly directions and approaches the Kongo closely in longitude 2I 26t Then it takes a southwesterly course The parallelism of these rivers with the Iongo explains the absence of tributaries in the central part of its upper course HE ALTH MATTERS Pasteurs Methods RECENT criticisms of the inoculationmethod of Pasteur for rabies have been very unfavorable but the report of the English Com mittee will undoubtedly turn the tide again in the opposite direction It will be remembered that this committee was appointed by the President of the Local Government Board in April I886 to inquire into Pasteurs treatment of this disease Its report has just been presented to Parliament The value of such a report depends en MAP SHOWING LATEST INFORMATION ON THE KONGO BASIN Alima and then started Qn his important journey He left Madi villeDn July I2 I885 travelling in a northeasterly direction He crossed the Sebe farther north than this river was supposed to run and crossed the watershed between the Likona and Ogove under the equator The most northern point reached is Iluku situated in a densely populated region He indicates that this region belongs to the drainage area of the Ogove the Ivindo rising near this place This is an important discovery as it considerably enlarges the drainage area of the Ogove De Brazza returned to the Kongo by way of the Likuala Close to the mouth of this river a little farther east the Sanga which according to von Frangois carries a great volume of water empties Therefore it must drain an extensive area As the western tributaries of the Obangi are of no great importance and the tributaries of the Ogove extend so far east we must suppose that its sources lie far north and it may be that the rivers Kadei and Nana which have been described to Flegel by the natives are its upper course Since the accompanying sketchmap was engraved we learn from tirely upon the qualifications of those who form the committee and we presume that composed as it is of some of the most eminent of English investigators its conclusion will receive the most respect ful and careful consideration by the scientific world The report is signed by James Paget Chairman T Lauder Brunton George Fleming Joseph Lister Richard Quain Henry E Roscoe I Burdon Sanderson and Victor Horsley We venture to say that no more eminent committee was ever appointed on such an investigation In the course of its inquiry the committee visited Paris to obtain information from Pasteur himself and to observe his method of treatment They investigated a considerable number of persons inoculated by him Mr Horsley conducted a careful series of ex periments on the lower animals and entirely confirms Pasteurs discovery of a method by which they may be protected from the infection of rabies The committee states that  it may be deemed certain that M Pasteur has discovered a method of protection from rabies comparable with that which lraccination affords against infec tion from smallpos It would be difficult to overestimate the im SCIENCE43 portance of the discovery whether for its practical utility or for its application in general pathology The committee investigated ninety cases treated by Pasteur Of this number twentyfour had been bitten on naked parts by undoubtedly rabid dogs and the wounds were not cauterized nor otherwise treated in any way likely to have prevented the action of the trirus Of thirtyone that were bitten there was no clear evidence that the dogs vere rabid and in others the bites had been inflicted through the clothes It is esti mated from experience of the results of bites in other casesthat llad they not been inoculated not less than eight among these ninety persons would have died Not one of them has shown since the inoculation any signs of hydrophobia The committee thinks it certain that the inoculations practised by M Pasteur have prevented the occurrence of hydrophobia in a large proportion of those who if they had not been so inoculated would have died of that disease And his discovery shows that it may become possible to arrest by inoculation even after infection other diseases besides hydrophobia If rabies be not reduced among the dogs of England there will always be a largenumber of persons who will require treat ment Ihe average annual number of deaths from hydrophobia during the ten years ending I885 was in all England A3 in London alone 85 These numbers may be taken as representing only five per cent of the persons bittell so that the preventive treatment will be required for 860 persons in all England and for I70 in London alone In commenting on this report of the committee the London LanceS says that their verdict is the most important yet pro nounced upon the subject and must go far to decide the question of the prophylactic value of the inoculation of Pasteur The conclusion that the method has saved a considerable number of lives and that it is at present and probably will be for long the only mode of saving from death those who have been bitten by a rabid dog affords strong support to Pasteurs conclusions and we need hardly say must havte most important practical results MEASLESThe prevalence of measles in some parts of the world and its fatality have aroused healthauthorities to such an appreciation of the necessity for restricting the spread of this disease that oicial steps are being taken for the attainment of this end A recent occurrence at Portsmouth England makes the rlecessity for this work more emphatic H M S Crocodile arriared at that place with forty persons sick with measles on board who were permitted to land From these individuals the disease has spread to an epidemic and at last reports the number of deaths was one hundred and ninetyseven LEPROSY IN LOUISIANA Considerable excitement has been occasioned in Louisiana by the report that leprosy existed at St Martinsville in that State The State Board of Health has made an examination and finds that five persons are suffering from un loubted leprosy while three others are as yet in doubt BOOK  REVIEWS Chczoce and Iuck a l9sscusszon of Ghe Ictws of Iuck Cosgcs denses Wctgers Loerzes ctndK Ghe FczEczes of GczoHbDng wsth Sotes on Poker and lVartzngtes BY RICHARD A PROCTOR London Longmans Green  Co THE persistency of a superstition can generally be referred to the subtleness and persuasiveness of the logic upon which it is founded or to the fact that it appeals to a strong instinct in human nature Doubtless both these influences have been at work in keeping alive among those in whom the hazarding instmct is at all strong a fond ness towards a belief in their own favoritism in the obscure forces which control luck and in the sundry other agencies which go to make of chance somethingwhich is more than chance For the benefit of suchand they form a respectable portion both in size and ability of mankindMr Proctor has written this book He hopes to be able to convince a few of the errors of their ways sadly recog nizing  that the gambling fraternity will continue to proclaim their belief in luck    and the community on whom they prey will for the most part continue to submit to the process of plucking in full belief that they are on their way to fortune The widespread belief in luck is in many ways easy to account in the lives of every one of us and it is but natural that wlaere this chance favors the success of our projects though not the least to our creditthis should have a clecided influence in the shaping of our character WIuch that is attributed to good forttlne is really good common sense and wise forethought but allowing for that as tong as there remains this element of uncertainty in our lives it is eviclent that there lnust be certain individuals who are lucky in the sense that they have been fortunate when they had no very good reason to expect success and certain olhers who have been unlucky under the same circumstances But this Mr Proctor well insists is a very different thing from the common conception of a lucky individual which regards such a man as more likely to be fortunate in success depending entirely on chance in the future as a chosen being for whose benefit the laws of probabilities will be suspended and who can even with considerable confidence count upon such benign intervention It is this conception that has the strongest hold upon gamblers upon the wisest and sharpest of them as well as upon the people at large alJd is a very ridiculous and a very dangerous superstition If some way could be devised by which the expectation the sub jective feeling of confidence could be properly proportioned to the mathematical chance of securing the desired prize lotteries could no longer exist and the chance forms of gambling would appear as utter folly The methods by which such occupations are carried on are devised to carefully prevent any such enlightenment and they easily succeed in so doing The logic of the matter is very simple Take lotteries as an ex ample If ten persons each deposit five dollars and agree that the one throwing the highest number of points with a pair of dice shall receive the fifty dollars that wobld be a fair lottery To test its fairness we have simply to consider that if one person bought all ten deposits he would be sure to win and would neither lose nor gain in other words mathematically the price to be paid for a share in a lottery is obtained by dividing the amount that can be gained by the number of shares No lottery of this sort would pay hence no paying lottery is fair and every lottery that exists pays those who control it very well indeed The Louisiana lottery the peculiarity of which Mr Proctor characterizes as s the calm admission in all advertisements that it is a gross and unmitigated swindle sells monthly IOOOOO tlckets at five dollars each Deducting from the ooooo thus received as much as IOOOO for expenses and a simi lar amount for  the charitable and educational purposes for which the State sanctions the lottery there remain 480ooo Instead of distributing all this in prizes they distribute only 8265ooo and thus when all the tickets are sold and few are ever left the managers have a clear profit of fortyfive per cent per rmonth This is exactly the same kind of swindling as would be committed by the man who invited the ten persons to deposit their five dollars were he to give the one who threw the highest number of points 2650 and quietly pocket the 2350 as a reward for his trouble Lotteries exist and pay because people are willing to give more for the chance of securing a prize than they ought to give They dwell frequently and long on the immensity of the prize entirely underestimating the slightness of the possibility of their securing it and thus cherish a sort of optimism which overlooks barefaced robbery and tolerates the most glaring frauds That such is the case was experimentally demonstrated by the English Government Tickets for a lottery were offered for sale not at a fixed price but for what they would fetch The contractorsbought of the government tickets mathematically worth Io at I6 and again sold the tickets at a large advance The public was perfectly willing and actually asked to be plundered Gamblingbanks and the superstitions of gamblers offer a still more interesting topic Here there is often much ingenuity dis played in arranging plans by which apparently fortunes must be won alld in defending pet notions with an array of apparently sound argument But the reason why a bank must win has often been exposed It is simply that it reserves for itself under certain con ditions apparently very unlikely a certain sum apparently small or it stakes a larger sum at exaggerated odds for the great proba bility of winning a small fee Thus the refaiZ in roWge eg noir which apparently is a most improbable event must by the doctrine J ULY 2 2 I 88 7 SGIFxNCE

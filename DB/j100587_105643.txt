MARCH 1761 IN A LETTER TO THE REVEREND DR CHARLES LYTTELTON DEAN OF EXETER FROM THE REVEREND WILLIAM BORLASE M A F R S ON TUESDAY THE 31ST OF MARCH 1761 ABOUT FIVE OCLOCK IN THE AFTERNOON THERE WAS A VERY UNCOMMON MOTION OF THE TIDE IN MOUNTSBAY CORNWALL THE MOON HAD ENTERED HER LAST QUARTER ON THE 28TH AT THREE P M SO THAT IT WAS FULL SEA THAT DAY THE 31ST AT OR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR P M AND THE TIDE ACCORDING TO THE RECKONING OF THIS NEIGHBOURING SHORE JUST PAST THE LEAST NEAPTIDE OF THE LAST QUARTER OF THE MOON AFTER THE TIDE HAD EBBED ABOUT FOUR HOURS AND HALF FOR THE TIME IS NOT DETERMINED WITH PRECISION INSTEAD OF CON TINUING TO RETREAT GRADUALLY AS USUAL TILL IT HAD COM PLETED THE SIX HOURS EBB ON A SUDDEN IT ADVANCED AS IT IS USUALLY AT THE TIME OF THE MOON AT AN HOUR AND HALF BEFORE HIGHWATER IT THEN RETREATED NIGH TO THE POINT OF LOWWATER THEN IT ADVANCED AGAIN AND RE TREATED MAKING FIVE ADVANCES AND AS MANY RECESSES IN THE SPACE OF ONE HOUR VIZ FROM ABOUT FIVE TO SIX OCLOCK WHICH WAS THE WHOLE TIME THAT THESE UN COMMON STRETCHES OF THE TIDE CONTINUED BUT THE FIRST MOTION WAS MOST CONSIDERABLE THE SEA ADVANCING THE FIRST TIME TO A QUARTER EBB BUT THE SECOND ADVANCE WAS BUT READ JAN 14 1762419 BUT AS FAR AS THE SEA REACHES AT HALF EBB A SMALL SLOOP OF 30 TONS BURTHEN AT THAT TIME LADEN AND DRY IN PEN ZANCE PIER BY THE FIRST SURGE WAS FLEETED BY WHICH IT APPEARS THAT THE WATERS ROSE AT THIS PLACE SIX FEET PERPENDICULAR THAT SLOOP REQUIRING SIX FEET OF WATER TO FLEET IT AT THE PIER OF ST MICHAELS MOUNT THREE MILES TO THE EAST OF PENZANCE THE TIDE WAS OBSERVED AT THE SAME TIME TO RISE AND FALL ABOUT FOUR FEET AT NEW LYN A MILE WEST OF PENZANCE THE TIDE ROSE TO THE SAME HEIGHT NEARLY AS AT PENZANCE AT MOUSHOLE PIER THREE MILES S W OF PENZANCE IT WAS ONLY OBSERVED THAT THE SEA WAS IN GREAT AGITATION AND THE FISHINGBOATS IN DANGER AT THE ISLANDS OF SCILLY THE SEA WAS JUDGED TO RISE ABOUT FOUR FEET BUT THE AGITA TION TO HAVE CONTINUED LONGER THAN IN MOUNTSBAY VIZ MORE THAN TWO HOURS THE WEATHER HAD BEEN FAIR AND SUNSHINE WITH CALMS FOR FOUR DAYS BEFORE IN MOUNTSBAY BUT ON THE EVENING OF THE 30TH IT WAS WINDY AND ON THE 31ST WINDY AND CLOUDY THE

AGITATION CLOUDY AND WINDY WITH THE AMEY OF BRISTOL SOME LEAGUES OFF LISBON A MOST VIOLENT STORM FOLLOWED THE AGITATION OF THE SEA 4 THERE WAS A GREAT CONFORMITY BETWEEN THE EF FECTS OF THE EARTHQUAKE OF NOVEMBER 1 1755 AND OF THIS OF MARCH THE 31ST 1761 FIRST IN THE EXTENT 2DLY IN THE RISE OF THE WATERS 3DLY IN THE CALM NESS OF THE WEATHER IN MOST PARTS 4THLY IN THE SUC CESSION OF TIME BEGINNING SOONER AT LISBON THAN ON THE NORTHERN SHORES BOTH TIMES QUAERE IF THIS CONFORMITY AND OTHERS WHICH MIGHT EASILY BE TRACED FROM THE TRANSACTIONS SO RE MARKABLE IN DIFFERENT CLIMATES IN MANY PLACES AND IN MORE IT MAY HAVE PASSED AWAY UNNOTICED COULD PROCEED FROM ANY THING VAGUE UNSETTLED AND DIS SIMILAR QUAERE 2DLY IF THE TRUE CAUSE IN BOTH INSTANCES WAS NOT SOME EXPLOSIONS IN AND ERUPTIONS FROM THE SAME SUBTERRANEOUS CAVERNS OF THE EARTH CAVERNS CIR CUMSCRIBED AS BEFORE AND BRANCHED OFF NEARLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION THE SAME DUCTS AND GROTTS COMMUNI CATING THE SHOCK OF MARCH THE 31ST 1761 AS THEY DID BEFORE ON THE FIRST OF NOVEMBER 1755 TO THE WATERS OF THE BRITISH ISLES AND SOME ISLANDS IN AME RICA BUT NOT WITH EQUAL FORCE NOR DIFFUSING THEIR TREMORS SO UNIVERSALLY TO LAND SEA LAKE AND POND THE INFLAMMABLE MATERIALS BEING EITHER NOT EQUAL IN QUANTITY OR NOT EQUALLY COMBUSTIBLE OR EXPLOSIVE 5 AS433 5 AS IT WAS CALM IN MOST PLACES IT WAS SUCCEEDED BY A VIOLENT STORM IN LATIT 43 AT SEA QUAERE WHETHER THIS STORM DID NOT PUT AN END TO THE EARTHQUAKE IN THE SPOT AND NEIGHBOURHOOD OF ITS GREATEST MOMENTUM THE EXTRAORDINARY VENT OR BREAKING FORTH OF THE IMPRISONED VAPOURS LEAVING THE SHAKEN PARTS OF THE EARTHS SHELL QUICKLY TO SETTLE AND RETURN TO ITS WONTED STABILITY 6 AT CORK IN IRELAND IF THOSE ACCOUNTS MAY BE DEPENDED ON THERE ARE TWO PARTICULARS REMARKABLE THAT SHOCK WAS FELT ALMOST AT THE SAME TIME OF THE DAY AS AT LISBON 2DLY THAT IT WAS FELT ONLY AT LAND NOT APPARENT IN THE SEA AT LOCHNESS MOUNTSBAY AND KINSALE IT WAS VISIBLE IN THE WATERS ONLY WITH OUT AFFECTING THE LAND AT AND NEAR LISBON FORCIBLY AGITATING BOTH LAND AND WATER 7 QUAERE WHETHER IT IS NOT APPARENT FROM THESE SIMILAR EFFECTS AT SUCH DISTANT TIMES AND IN PLACES SO REMOTE FROM EACH OTHER THAT THE SHELL OF THE EARTH IS CAVERNOUS ABOUNDING MORE OR LESS AND INTERSPERSED WITH OBLATE COMPRESSED HOLLOWS WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE PORES OF OUR TERRAQUEOUS GLOBE AND SPREAD FROM DIFFERENT POINTS OR CENTERS LIKE THE ROOTS OF TREES FROM THEIR TRUNKS AND WHETHER THE CAVES AND SUBTERRANEOUS PASSAGES BEING IN SOME PARTS NARROW LITTLE MORE CROOKED OR OTHERWISE IMPEDED BY ACCIDENTAL OBSTRUCTIONS OR MORE REMOTE FROM THE FIRST AND CHIEF MOMENTUM MAY NOT BE THE REASON WHY THE SURFACE IN SOME PLACES IS LITTLE OR NOT AT ALL AFFECTED AND THE SHOCK LATER IN TIME BUT WHERE THE PASSAGES ARE STRAIGHT AND OPEN AND NEAR THE FIRST AND STRONGEST EXPLOSION THERE THE SHOCK IS EARLIER AND THE AGITATION PROPORTIONABLY MORE VIOLENT K K K 2 LXVI OB

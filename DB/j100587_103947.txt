A DUTCH GENTLE MAN INTITLED VERHANDELING TOT EEN PROEVE OM TE WEETEN DE PROBABLE MENIGTE DES VOLKS IN DE PROVENTIE VAN HOLLANDT EN WESTVRIESLANDT WAS READ BEFORE THIS HONOURABLE S O C I E T Y WHEREIN THE AUTHOR TO THE GREAT DISPARAGEMENT OF THE CITY OF LONDON HAS ASSERTED A THAT THE CITY OF PARIS IN THE YEAR 1684 AND AT THE CLOSE OF THE LAST CENTURY CONTAIND MORE INHABITANTS THAN THE CITY OF LONDON AND TO PROVE THAT PARIS CONTAINS A GREATER NUM BER OF INHABITANTS THAN LONDON HE HAS HAD RECOURSE TO THE ACCOUNTS OF CHRISTENINGS ANNUALLY PUBLISHD IN BOTH CITIES WITHOUT GIVING HIMSELF THE TROUBLE TO INQUIRE INTO THE NATURE OF THOSE HIS AUTHORITIES WHICH IF HE HAD HE WOULD SOON HAVE DISCOVERD THAT THE FORMER IS A PERFECT ACCOUNT WHILE THE LATTER IS PERHAPS THE MOST DEFECTIVE OF ANY EXTANT FOR THE CHRISTENINGS THEREIN MENTIOND ARE ONLY THOSE WHERE AT THE PARISH CLERKS ARE PRESENT WHICH I AM OF OPI NION CANNOT AMOUNT TO NEAR TWO THIRDS OF THE WHOLE AS I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO MAKE

TOT GEN 90883 88609 1741 90350 THIS DIFFERENCE IN FAVOUR OF THE CHRISTENINGS IS OWING TO THE CITIZENS OF THAT TIME BEING ALMOST OF THE SAME RELIGION BUT THE CIVIL WAR BREAKING OUT SOON AFTER THE PEOPLE DEVIATED INTO A VARIETY OF SECTS SUBVERTED THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND AND ASSUMING THE CIVIL POWER ESTABLISHD A NEW HIERARCHY OR CHURCH GOVERNMENT BUT THE MEMBERS OF THE ABOLISHD CHURCH CONTINUING TO BAPTIZE AMONG THEMSELVES WITH A MAITLANDS HIST LOND P 535 B GRAUNTS NAT AND POLIT OBSERV 3D EDIT LOND C MAITLANDS HIST LOND P 535409 WITHOUT REPORTING THEIR CHRISTENINGS TO THE NEWAP POINTED MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY OF PARISHCLERKS OCCASIOND A VERY GREAT DEFECT IN THE ACCOUNT OF CHRISTENINGS ANNUALLY PUBLISHD BY THE SAID PARISH CLERKS FROM THIS EPOCHA IS TO BE DATED THE MAJORITY OF THE BURIALS IN THE BILL OF MORTALITY OVER THE CHRISTENINGS OF LONDON AND THOUGH THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND WAS SOON AFTER REESTABLISHD YET THE NUMEROUS DIS SENTERS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS PERSEVERING IN THEIR SEPARATION CONTINUED TO BAPTIZE WITHIN THEMSELVES WITHOUT SENDING IN ACCOUNTS OF THEIR CHRISTENINGS TO THE RESTORD MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY OF PARISH CLERKS AND THE SCHISM STILL CONTINUING THE AC COUNTS OF THE CHRISTENINGS AND BURIALS OF THIS CITY REMAIN UPON THE ANCIENT FOOT OF DIVISION AND IMPER FECTION ADD TO THIS THAT NOT ONLY ALL THE FOREIGN CHURCHES IN LONDON CHRISTEN WITHIN THEMSELVES BUT LIKEWISE MANY CHURCHES AND CHAPELS OF THE CHURCH OF ENG LAND THAT SEND NOT IN THEIR ACCOUNTS TO THE COM PANY OF PARISHCLERKS WHICH TOGETHER WITH THOSE OF THE DISSENTERS AND FOREIGNERS OF ALL DENOMINATIONS AMOUNT TO NO LESS A NUMBER THAN ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTYONE CONGREGATIONS WHOSE ACCOUNTS OF CHRIST ENINGS ARE NOT PUBLISHD BY WHICH IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE VAST DISPARITY BETWEEN THE CHRISTENINGS AND BU RIALS OF THIS CITY IS NOT OWING AS MR KERSSEBOOM VAINLY IMAGINES A TO THE RESIDENCE OF THE COURT CON VENTION OF PARLIAMENT AND GREAT RESORT OF PEOPLE FROM ALL PARTS BUT IN FACT TO THE GREAT DEFECT ABOVE MENTIOND G G G 2 HOW  KERSSEBOOMS VERHANDEL P 25410 HOWEVER THAT GENTLEMAN FROM THE AFORESAID VERY DEFECTIVE ACCOUNT OF THE CHRISTENINGS OF THIS CITY HAS CALCULATED THE NUMBER OF ITS INHABITANTS BY A MEDIUM OF THE CHRISTENINGS IN THE YEARS 1684 A AND 1685 WHEREBY HE MAKES THE NUMBER AT THAT TIME AMOUNT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FORTYFOUR BUT AS THIS NUMBER IS ONLY TAKEN FROM A MEDIUM OF TWO YEARS HE IMAGINES IT TOO GREAT THERE FORE TO REDUCE THE SAME TO THE NUMBER OF B FOUR HUN DRED AND SIXTYNINE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED BY A MEDIUM OF TWENTY YEARS HE HAS UNWARRANTABLY PRE CLUDED THE SUM OF FOURTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUN DRED AND TWO THE NUMBER OF CHRISTENINGS IN THE YEAR 1684 TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE SUM OF ELEVEN THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND FIFTYONE THE NUM BER OF CHRISTENINGS IN THE YEAR 1674 WHEREBY THE NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON IS VERY MUCH LESSEND AND AS A FARTHER INSTANCE OF MR KERSSEBOOMS PARTI ALITY IN FAVOUR OF THE CITY OF PARIS HE HAS CALCULATED THE NUMBER OF ITS INHABITANTS WITHOUT MENTIONING THE UNCERTAINTY OF A CALCULATION FOUNDED ON A SHORT SPACE OF TIME AS HE HAS DONE IN THE CASE OF LON DON AT A MEDIUM OF THE CHRISTENINGS FOR THE YEARS C 1670 1671 AND 1672 WHEREBY HE MAKES THEM AT THAT TIME AMOUNT TO SIX HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED ADDING THE NUMBER MUST HAVE BEEN GREATER AT THE END OF THE LAST CENTURY AS BY HIS EXTRAVAGANT MANNER OF CALCULATION IT SHOULD BE AT PRESENT BUT AS IT APPEARS BY THE ABOVESPECIFIED TEN YEARS ACCOUNT THAT THE CHRISTENINGS OF LONDON GREATLY EXCEED THE BURIALS OF THAT TIME I THINK IT WILL NOT BE  KERSSEBOOMS VERHANDEL P 14 B ID IBID C IB P 16411 BE DENYD THAT THEY EXCEED THE SAME AT PRESENT ESPE CIALLY IF WE CONSIDER THAT THE NUMBER OF CHRISTENINGS IN PARIS AT A MEDIUM OF NINE YEARS PRECEDING THAT OF 1737 EXCEEDED THAT OF THE BURIALS NINETYEIGHT YEARLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT CITY NOT ONLY ABOUNDS WITH A VAST NUMBER OF RELIGIOUS OF BOTH SEXES WHO ARE SWORN TO CELIBACY BUT LIKEWISE MANY THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS BELONGING TO THE UNIVERSITY WHO LEAD A SINGLE LIFE WHEREAS IN LONDON THERE ARE NO SUCH PERSONS TO PREVENT THE INCREASE OF ITS INHABITANTS AND AS IN MY POLITICAL ACCOUNT OF LONDON IT APPEARS A THAT AT A MEDIUM OF NINE YEARS THERE ARE ANNUALLY BURIED IN LONDON 29542 AND IN PARIS ONLY 17804 WHICH IS 11738 IN FAVOUR OF THE FORMER SO MUST THE BIRTHS IN LONDON AT PRESENT ACCORD ING TO THE ABOVESPECIFIED TEN YEARS  ACCOUNT THE REASONS AFORESAID AND THE PARIS ACCOUNT OF CHRI STENINGS YEARLY EXCEED THOSE OF PARIS 12320 WHERE BY IS SHEWN THAT THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON EXCEED THOSE OF PARIS ABOVE THREE FIFTHS IN NUMBER BY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I DOUBT NOT BUT MR KERSSE BOOMS ASTONISHMENT WILL NOT ONLY CEASE IN RESPECT TO THE GREAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CHRISTENINGS AND BURIALS OF LONDON BUT HE WILL BE LIKEWISE INDUCD TO DO JUSTICE TO THIS INJURD CITY BY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE INHABITANTS THEREOF VASTLY EXCEED THOSE OF PARIS IN POINT OF NUMBER WHAT MR KERSSEBOOMS PARTIALITY IN FAVOUR OF THE CITY OF PARIS IS OWING TO I KNOW NOT UNLESS IT BE OUT OF PIQUE TO SIR WILLIAM PETTY WITH WHOM HE SEEMS NOT WELL PLEASD FOR SAYING THAT THE CITY OF LONDON CONTAIND AS MANY INHABITANTS AS THE PROVINCE OF A MAITLANDS HIST LOND P 540 AND 548412 OF HOLLAND AND WESTFIRELAND WHICH I THINK WILL BE NO DIFFICULT MATTER TO MAKE APPEAR BY ALLOW ING THAT GENTLEMAN HIS SUPPOSD NUMBER OF 28000 A CHILDREN TO BE ANNUALLY BORN IN THE SAID PROVINCE WHEREAS ACCORDING TO THE ABOVESPECIFIED TEN YEARS ACCOUNT AND THE PARIS PROPORTION OF BIRTHS THERE MUST BE ANNUALLY BORN IN LONDON THIRTYONE THOUSAND AND EIGHT CHILDREN THEREFORE AS THIS NUMBER AC CORDING TO MY CALCULATION B IS THE PRODUCE OF 725903 THE PRESENT NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF LONDON SO MUST 28000 C THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN SUPPOSED TO BE BORN YEARLY IN THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND AND WEST FRIESLAND BE THE PRODUCE OF 655485 THE PRESENT NUMBER OF THE INHABITANTS OF THE SAID PROVINCE NOTWITHSTANDING MR KERSSEBOOM BY HIS EXCESSIVE AND UNPRECEDENTED RECKONING OF THE BIRTHS AT A THIRTY FIFTH PART OF THE PEOPLE HAS CALCULATED THEM AT 980000 WHEREAS BY THE INGENIOUS AND LEARNED DR HALLEYS METHOD OF CALCULATION WHICH IS SO HIGHLY APPROVD OF BY MR KERSSEBOOM THAT HE SEEMINGLY WOULD BE THOUGHT TO MAKE IT THE STANDARD OF HIS CAL CULATIONS THE INHABITANTS OF THE PROVINCE OF HOLLAND AND WESTFRIESLAND DO NOT AMOUNT TO TWENTYNINE TIMES THE NUMBER OF THE BIRTHS WHICH GIVES ROOM TO SUSPECT THAT MR KERSSEBOOM HAS INTRODUCD THIS UNHEARDOF EXCESS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THE SAID PROVINCE OF HOLLAND AND WESTFRIESLAND  KERSSEBOOMS VERHANDEL P 3 B MAITLANDS HIST LOND P 541 C KERSSEBOOMS VERHANDEL P 3 PRINTED FOR T W O O D W A R D AT THE HALFMOON BETWEEN THE TWO TEMPLEGATES IN FLEETSTREET

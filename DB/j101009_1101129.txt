OTIIERS Decided at Rich mond January 14 1904 Bvuchana J Cardwell and Harrison JJ dis senting 1 JUDICIAL SALEsResalesFailure of commissioner to give bond Clerks certificate to advertisement The provisions of sec 3398 of the Code requiring commissioners to give bond before selling property under a decree of court and to append the certificate of the clerk to the adver tisement showing that the bond has been given applies to all judicial sales whether original or resales and a purchaser who seeks to avail himself of the protection afforded by section 3399 of Code must show either that the commissioner to whom payments were made actually gave the bond required of him or that the clerks certificate that such bond had been given was appended to the advertisement The commissioner is not authorized to collect the purchase money where another has been appointed for that purpose though the purchaser is protected if the proper certificate of the clerk is appended to the advertisement of the sale alnd he has no notice of the subseouent appointment of another 2 JUDICIAL SALEsResalePurchase by surety of first purchaser Bond of commissionerClerks certificate A purchaser of land at a resale made in a judicial proceeding is not entitled to credit for payments made to a commissioner who has failed to account for the same where it appears that the commissioner was not required to give any bond as commissioner to resell and he neither gave any such bond nor appended to the adver vertisement of resale the clerks certificate that such bond was given The fact that a bond was required of and given by the same commissioner before making the original sale and that the surety of the purchaser at the original sale became the purchaser at the resale cannot change the result The resale though a means of enforcing the collection of the balance due on the first sale is not such a collection of the bonds given at the first sale as will be protected by the publication of the clerks cer tificate annexed to the advertisement of the first sale TENCH V GRAYDecided at Richmond January 14 1904Har rison J Absent Bvechanan J 1 MOTION FOR JUDGMENT FOR MONEYNoticeRequisitesHow time

CONFERRED BY AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES FOR the twelfth year statistics have been collected concerning ihe degrees of doctor of philosophy or of science conferred by the universities of the United States and the data are summarized in the accompany ing tables There were this year conferred 378 degrees exactly the same number as last year but an increase of more than 100 over the average of the ten preceding years Details for these ten years will be found in the issue of SCIENCE for August 30 1907 The number twelve years ago was scarcely over 200 and now has nearly doubled Columbia this year conferred 59 degrees which is the largest number so far from a single institution and places Columbia be fore Harvard in the total number of de grees conferred in twelve years 436 as compared with 418 Chicago with 448 stands first Yale with 394 stands close to Harvard The Johns Hopkins which earlier was at the head of the list has not maintained its position and is now in the group with Pennsylvania and Cornell These seven institutions are decidedly be fore all others in their graduate schools having conferred 2579 degrees as com pared with 892 by the thirtyfive other uni versities Among the state universities Wisconsin leads with 110 degrees followed by Michigan with 86 and California with 47 The second table gives similar details for the natural and exact sciences Exactly half of the degrees were this year in the sciences whereas in the first ten years cov ered by these statistics the percentage was 45 Chicago here also stands at the head 1      N S VOL XXX No 764 TABLE I

the Johns Hopkins two years ago At the Johns Iopkins 57 per cent of all degrees have been in the sciences at Cornell 60 per cent whereas at Harvard the percentage is 40 at Columbia 41 and at Yale and Pennsylvania 42 This year just one third of the degrees at Harvard were in the sci ences whereas at Yale the percentage was 60 It is noticeable that sciences do not predominate in the state institutions as would probably be expected The percent ages of degrees in the sciences for Wiscon sin Washington California Nebraska and Minnesota respectively are 32 40 68 66 and 31 The change in the position of the leading universities in the number of de grees awarded in the sciences is indicated by the number of scientific men included among the leading 1000 scientific men of 226 SCIENCE 49 57

not significant A real tendency may however be indicated by the increased number of degrees in physiology bacteriology pathology agri culture and anthropology The institutions which this year con ferred two or more degrees in a science are in chemistry Yale 7 Cornell and Johns Hopkins 6 each Harvard and Pennsylvania 5 each Columbia 4 in physics Cornell Johns Hopkins Pennsyl vania and Yale 3

Gesners famous Natural History was called to my atten tion many years ago when the error appeared to be sufficiently obvious but not having the proper materials then in hand it was not traced to its source Attention was again directed to the subject by a recent history of biology in which it is stated that his Gesners friend supplied one of the originalsthe drawing of the rhi noceros Again in a delightful essay on Gesner written some years ago by a revered teacher and friend we are told that the names of very few of the draughtsmen and engravers  of the History are known but Gesner says that Lucas Schron drew the birds and that Albrecht Diirer made the cut of the rhinoceros This suggests that Diirer was not only the author of the engraving but that he actually made it for Gesners work and this impres sion is confirmed when we read farther on of His contemporary and friend Diirer The truth of the matter is easily set forth Albert Diirer made the original of the rhi noceros picture but he did not contribute it to the Historia Animalium nor was he strictly a contemporary or in any sense a friend of the author When Albrecht Diirer 14711528 died a worldfamous artist Conrad Gesner 1516 1565 was a lad of twelve and the  Historia Animalium  15511558 did not begin to appear until nearly forty years after the en graving of the rhinoceros was made and pub lished Gesner simply borrowed this plate and in accordance with his commendable cus tom acknowledged it in a descriptive note or legend placed beside the cut Diirers name here appears for the first and so far as I have 232 SCIENCE

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106877,AN ACCOUNT OF SOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER BY JAMES LOUIS MACIE ESQ F R S,I206946,368 XXII AN ACCOUNT OF SOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER BY JAMES LOUIS MACIE EJQ F R S READ JULY 7 1791 THE TABASHEER EMPLOYED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WAS THAT WHICH DR RUSSELL LAID BEFORE THE SOCIETY AS SPECI MENS OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE EVENING HIS PAPER UPON THE SUB JECT WAS READ  THERE WERE SEVEN PARCELS NO 1 CONSISTED OF TABASHEER EXTRACTED FROM THE BAMBOO BY DR RUSSELL HIMSELF NO 2 HAD BEEN PARTLY TAKEN FROM THE REED IN DR RUS SELLS PRESENCE AND PARTLY BROUGHT TO HIM AT DIFFERENT TIMES BY A PERSON WHO WORKED IN BAMBOOS NO 3 WAS THE TABASHEER FROM HYDRABAD THE FINEST KIND OF THIS SUBSTANCE TO BE BOUGHT NOS 4 5 AND 6 ALL CAME FROM MASULAPATAM WHERE THEY ARE SOLD AT A VERY LOW PRICE THESE THREE KINDS HAVE BEEN THOUGHT TO BE ARTIFICIAL COMPOSITIONS IN IMITATION OF THE TRUE TABASHEER AND TO BE MADE OF CALCINED BONES NO 7 HAD NO ACCOUNT AFFIXED TO IT THE TABASHEER FROM HYDRABAD BEING IN THE GREATEST QUAN TITY AND APPEARING THE MOST HOMOGENEOUS AND PURE THE EXPERIMENTS WERE BEGUN AND PRINCIPALLY MADE WITH IT  SEE PHIL TRANS VOL LXXX P 283 HYDRABADMR MACIES ACCOUNT C 369 HYDRABAD TABASHEER NO 3  I A THIS IN ITS GENERAL APPEARANCE VERY MUCH RESEM BLED FRAGMENTS OF THAT VARIETY OF CALCEDONY WHICH IS KNOWN TO MINERALOGISTS BY THE NAME OF CACHOLONG SOME PIECES WERE QUITE OPAQUE AND ABSOLUTELY WHITE BUT OTHERS POSSESSED A SMALL DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY AND HAD A BLUISH CAST THE LATTER HELD BEFORE A LIGHTED CANDLE APPEARED VERY PELLUCID AND OF A FLAME COLOUR THE PIECES WERE OF VARIOUS SIZES THE LARGEST OF THEM DID NOT EXCEED TWO OR THREE TENTHS OF AN INCH CUBIC THEIR SHAPE WAS QUITE IRREGULAR SOME OF THEM BORE IMPRESSIONS OF THE INNER PART OF THE BAMBOO AGAINST WHICH THEY WERE FORMED B THIS TABASHEER COULD NOT BE BROKEN BY PRESSURE BETWEEN THE FINGERS BUT BY THE TEETH IT WAS EASILY REDUCED TO POWDER ON FIRST CHEWING IT FELT GRITTY BUT SOON GROUND TO IMPALPABLE PARTICLES C APPLIED TO THE TONGUE IT ADHERED TO IT BY CAPILLARY ATTRACTION D IT HAD A DISAGREEABLE EARTHY TASTE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF MAGNESIA E NO LIGHT WAS PRODUCED EITHER BY CUTTING IT WITH A KNIFE OR BY RUBBING TWO PIECES OF IT TOGETHER IN THE DARK BUT A BIT OF THIS SUBSTANCE BEING LAID ON A HOT IRON SOON APPEARED SURROUNDED WITH A FEEBLE LUMINOUS AUREOLE BY BEING MADE RED HOT IT WAS DEPRIVED OF THIS PROPERTY OF SHINING WHEN GENTLY HEATED BUT RECOVERED IT AGAIN ON BEING KEPT FOR TWO MONTHS F EXAMINED WITH THE MICROSCOPE IT DID NOT APPEAR DIF FERENT FROM WHAT IT DOES TO THE NAKED EYE VOL LXXXI C C C G A370 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF G A QUANTITY OF THIS TABASHEER WHICH WEIGHED 757 GR IN AIR WEIGHED ONLY 411 GR IN DISTILLED WATER WHOSE TEMPE RATURE WAS 525 F WHICH MAKES ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO BE VERY NEARLY  2188 MR CAVENDISH HAVING TRIED THIS SAME PARCEL WHEN BECOME AGAIN QUITE DRY FOUND ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY TO BE  2169 TREATED WITH WATER  II A THIS TABASHEER PUT INTO WATER EMITTED A NUMBER OF BUBBLES OF AIR THE WHITE OPAQUE BITS BECAME TRANSPARENT IN A SMALL DEGREE ONLY BUT THE BLUISH ONES NEARLY AS MUCH SO AS GLASS IN THIS STATE THE DIFFERENT COLOUR PRODUCED BY REFLECTED AND BY TRANSMITTED LIGHT WAS VERY SENSIBLE B FOUR BITS OF THIS SUBSTANCE WEIGHING TOGETHER WHILE DRY AND OPAQUE 41 GR WERE PUT INTO DISTILLED WATER AND LET BECOME TRANSPARENT BEING THEN TAKEN OUT AND THE UNAB SORBED WATER HASTILY WIPED FROM THEIR SURFACE THEY WERE AGAIN WEIGHED AND WERE FOUND TO EQUAL 82 GR IN THE EXPERIMENT  I G 757 GR OF THIS SUBSTANCE AB SORBED 695 GR OF DISTILLED WATER C FOUR BITS OF TABASHEER WEIGHING TOGETHER 32 GR WERE BOILED FOR 30 IN HALF AN OUNCE OF DISTILLED WATER IN A FLORENCE FLASK WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RINCED WITH SOME OF THE SAME FLUID THIS WATER WHEN BECOME COLD DID NOT SHEW ANY CHANGE ON THE ADMIXTURE OF VITRIOLIC ACID OF ACID OF SUGAR NOR OF SOLUTIONS OF NITRE OF SILVER OR OF CRYSTALS OF SODA YET ON ITS EVAPORATION IT LEFT A WHITE FILM ON THE GLASS WHICH COULD NOT BE GOT OFF BY WASHING IN COLD WATER NOR BY HOT MARINESOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 371 INFERREDMARINEINFERRED ACID BUT WHICH WAS DISCHARGED BY WARM CAUSTIC VEGE TABLE ALKALI AND BY LONG EBULLITION IN WATER UPON THESE BITS OF TABASHEER ANOTHER HALF OUNCE OF DISTILLED WATER WAS POURED AND AGAIN BOILED FOR ABOUT HALF AN HOUR THIS WATER ALSO ON EVAPORATION LEFT A WHITE FILM ON THE GLASS VESSEL SIMILAR TO THE ABOVE THE PIECES OF TABASHEER HAVING BEEN DRIED BY EXPOSURE TO THE AIR FOR SOME DAYS IN A WARM ROOM WERE FOUND TO HAVE LOST ONETENTH OF A GRAIN OF THEIR WEIGHT TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE WHOLE OF A PIECE OF TABASHEER COULD BE DISSOLVED BY BOILING IN WATER A LITTLE BIT OF THIS SUB STANCE WEIGHING THREETENTHS OF A GRAIN WAS BOILED IN 36 OUNCES OF SOFT WATER FOR NEAR FIVE HOURS CONSECUTIVELY BUT BEING AFTERWARDS DRIED AND WEIGHED IT WAS NOT DIMINISHED IN QUANTITY NOR WAS IT DEPRIVED OF ITS TASTE WITH VEGETABLE COLOURS  III SOME TABASHEER REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WAS BOILED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME IN INFUSIONS OF TURNSOLE OF LOGWOOD AND OF DRIED RED CABBAGE BUT PRODUCED NOT THE LEAST CHANGE IN ANY ONE OF THEM AT THE FIRE  IV A A PIECE OF THIS TABASHEER THROWN INTO A RED HOT CRUCIBLE DID NOT BURN OR GROW BLACK KEPT RED HOT FOR SOME TIME IT UNDERWENT NO VISIBLE CHANGE BUT WHEN COLD IT WAS HARDER AND HAD ENTIRELY LOST ITS TASTE PUT INTO WATER IT C C C 2 GREW372 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF GREW TRANSPARENT JUST AS IT WOULD HAVE DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN IGNITED B 64 GR OF THIS SUBSTANCE MADE RED HOT IN A CRUCIBLE WERE FOUND UPON BEING WEIGHED AS SOON AS COLD TO HAVE LOST TWOTENTHS OF A GRAIN THIS LOSS APPEARS TO HAVE ARISEN MERELY FROM THE EXPULSION OF INTERPOSED MOISTURE FOR THESE HEATED PIECES ON BEING EXPOSED TO THE AIR FOR SOME DAYS RECOVERED EXACTLY THEIR FORMER WEIGHT C A BIT OF THIS SUBSTANCE WAS PUT INTO AN EARTHEN CRUCI BLE SURROUNDED WITH SAND AND KEPT RED HOT FOR SOME TIME WHEN COLD IT WAS STILL WHITE BOTH EXTERIORLY AND INTERIORLY D THROWN INTO SOME MELTED RED HOT NITRE THIS SUBSTANCE DID NOT PRODUCE ANY DEFLAGRATION OR SEEM TO SUFFER ANY ALTE RATION E A BIT EXPOSED ON CHARCOAL TO THE FLAME OF THE BLOWPIPE DID NOT DECREPITATE OR CHANGE COLOUR WHEN FIRST HEATED IT DIFFUSED A PLEASANT SMELL THEN CONTRACTED VERY CONSIDERABLY IN BULK AND BECAME TRANSPARENT BUT ON CONTINUING THE HEAT IT AGAIN GREW WHITE AND OPAQUE BUT SEEMED NOT TO SHEW ANY INCLINATION TO MELT PER SE POSSIBLY HOWEVER IT MAY SUFFER SUCH A SEMIFUSION OR SOFTENING OF THE WHOLE MASS AS TAKES PLACE IN CLAY WHEN EXPOSED TO AN INTENSE HEAT FOR WHEN THE BIT USED HAPPENED TO HAVE CRACKS IT SEPARATED DURING ITS CON TRACTION AT THESE CRACKS AND THE PARTS RECEDED FROM EACH OTHER WITHOUT FALLING ASUNDER IF WHILE THE BIT OF TABASHEER WAS EXPOSED TO THE FLAME ANY OF THE ASHES OF THE COAL FELL UPON IT IT INSTANTLY MELTED AND SMALL VERY FLUID BUBBLES WERE PRODUCED THAT THE OPACITY WHICH THIS SUBSTANCE ACQUIRES ON CONTINUING TO HEAT IT AFTER IT IS BECOME TRANSPARENT IS NOT OWING TO THE FUSION OF ITS 4 SURFACESOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 373 SURFACE BY MEANS OF SOME OF THE ASHES OF THE CHARCOAL SETTLING UPON IT UNOBSERVED APPEARED BY ITS UNDERGOING THE SAME CHANGE WHEN FIXED TO THE END OF A GLASS TUBE IN THE METHOD OF M DE SAUSSURE  WITH ACIDS  V A A PIECE OF TABASHEER WEIGHING 12 GR WAS FIRST LET SATIATE ITSELF WITH DISTILLED WATER ITS SURFACE BEING THEN WIPED DRY IT WAS PUT INTO A MATRASS WITH SOME PURE WHITE MARINE ACID WHOSE SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS 113 NO EFFER VESCENCE AROSE ON ITS IMMERSION INTO THE ACID NOR DID THIS MENSTRUUM EVEN BY EBULLITION SEEM TO HAVE ANY ACTION UPON IT OR ITSELF RECEIVE ANY COLOUR THE ACID BEING EVAPORATED LEFT ONLY SOME DARK COLOURED SPOTS ON THE GLASS THESE SPOTS WERE DISSOLVED BY DISTILLED WATER NO PRECIPITATION WAS PRODUCED IN THIS WATER BY VITRIOLIC ACID OR BY A SOLUTION OF CRYSTALS OF SODA THE BIT OF TABASHEER WASHED WITH WATER AND MADE RED HOT HAD NOT SUSTAINED ANY LOSS OF WEIGHT THE PORES OF THE MASS OF TABASHEER WERE FILLED WITH WATER BEFORE IT WAS PUT INTO THE ACID TO EXPEL THE COMMON AIR CON TAINED IN THEM AND WHICH WOULD HAVE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WITH ACCURACY WHETHER ANY EFFERVESCENCE WAS PRO DUCED ON ITS FIRST CONTACT WITH THE MENSTRUUM B ANOTHER PORTION OF TABASHEER WEIGHING 102 GR WAS BOILED IN SOME OF THE SAME MARINE ACID NOT THE LEAST PRECIPITATE WAS PRODUCED ON SATURATING THIS ACID WITH SOLUTION OF MILD SODA THIS TABASHEER ALSO AFTER HAVING BEEN  JOURNAL DE PHYSIQUE TOM XXVI P 409 BOILED374 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF BOILED IN WATER AND DRIED BY EXPOSURE FOR SOME DAYS TO THE AIR WAS STILL OF ITS FORMER WEIGHT  VI THIS SUBSTANCE SEEMED IN LIKE MANNER TO RESIST THE ACTION OF PURE WHITE NITROUS ACID BOILED UPON IT  VII A A BIT OF TABASHEER WEIGHING 06 GR WAS DIGESTED IN SOME STRONG WHITE VITRIOLIC ACID WHICH HAD BEEN MADE PER FECTLY PURE BY DISTILLATION IT DID NOT SEEM BY THIS TREATMENT TO SUFFER ANY CHANGE AND AFTER HAVING BEEN FREED FROM ALL AD HERING VITRIOLIC ACID BY BOILING IN WATER IT HAD NOT UNDER GONE ANY ALTERATION EITHER IN ITS WEIGHT OR PROPERTIES THE VITRIOLIC ACID AFFORDED NO PRECIPITATE ON BEING SATURATED WITH SODA B TWO GRAINS OF TABASHEER REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WERE MADE INTO A PASTE WITH SOME OF THIS SAME VITRIOLIC ACID AND THIS MIXTURE WAS HEATED TILL NEARLY DRY IT WAS THEN DIGESTED IN DISTILLED WATER THIS WATER BEING FILTERED TASTED SLIGHTLY ACID DID NOT PRODUCE THE LEAST TURBIDNESS WITH SOLUTION OF SODA AND SOME OF IT EVAPORATED LEFT ONLY A FAINT BLACK STAIN ON THE GLASS PRODUCED DOUBTLESS BY THE ACTION OF THE VITRIOLIC ACID ON A LITTLE VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH IT HAD RECEIVED EITHER FROM THE TABASHEER OR FROM THE PAPER THE UNDISSOLVED MATTER COLLECTED WASHED AND DRIED WEIGHED 19 GR  VIII 2 GR OF TABASHEER REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WERE LONG DIGESTED IN A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF LIQUID ACID OF SUGAR THE TASTE OF THE LIQUOR WAS NOT ALTERED AND BEING SATURATED WITH A SOLUTION OF CRYSTALS OF SODA IN DISTILLED WATER IT DID NOT AFFORD ANY PRECIPITATE THE TABASHEER HAVING BEEN FREED FROM ALL ADHERING ACID BY VERY CAREFUL ABLUTION WITH DISTILLED WATER AND LET DRY IN THE AIR WAS TOTALLY UNCHANGED IN ITS AP PEARANCE AND WEIGHED 198 GR THIS TABASHEER BEING GRA 2 DUALLYSOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 375 DUALLY HEATED TILL RED HOT DID NOT BECOME IN THE LEAST BLACK OR LOSE MUCH OF ITS WEIGHT A PROOF THAT NO ACID OF SUGAR HAD FIXED IN IT WITH LIQUID ALKALIES  IX A SOME LIQUID CAUSTIC VEGETABLE ALKALI BEING HEATED IN A PHIAL TABASHEER WAS ADDED TO IT WHICH DISSOLVED VERY READILY AND IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY WHEN THE ALKALI WOULD NOT TAKE UP ANY MORE IT WAS SET BY TO COOL BUT WAS NOT FOUND NEXT MORNING TO HAVE CRYSTALLIZED OR UNDERGONE ANY CHANGE THOUGH IT HAD BECOME VERY CONCENTRATED DURING THE BOILING BY THE EVAPORATION OF MUCH OF THE WATER B THIS SOLUTION HAD AN ALKALINE TASTE BUT SEEMINGLY WITH LITTLE IF ANY CAUSTICITY C A DROP OF IT CHANGED TO GREEN A WATERY TINCTURE OF DRIED RED CABBAGE D SOME OF THIS SOLUTION WAS EXPOSED IN A SHALLOW GLASS TO SPONTANEOUS EVAPORATION IN A WARM ROOM AT THE END OF A DAY OR TWO IT WAS CONVERTED INTO A FIRM MILKY JELLY AFTER A FEW DAYS MORE THIS JELLY WAS BECOME WHITER MORE OPAQUE AND HAD DRIED AND CRACKED INTO SEVERAL PIECES AND FINALLY IT BE CAME QUITE DRY AND CURLED UP AND SEPARATED FROM THE GLASS THE SAME CHANGE TOOK PLACE WHEN THE SOLUTION HAD BEEN DI LUTED WITH SEVERAL TIMES ITS BULK OF DISTILLED WATER ONLY THE JELLY WAS MUCH THINNER AND DRIED INTO A WHITE POWDER SOME OF THIS SOLUTION KEPT FOR MANY WEEKS IN A BOT TLE CLOSELY STOPPED DID NOT BECOME A JELLY OR UNDERGO ANY CHANGE E A376 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF E A SMALL QUANTITY OF THIS SOLUTION WAS LET FALL INTO A PROPORTIONABLY LARGE QUANTITY OF SPIRIT OF WINE WHOSE SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS838 THE MIXTURE IMMEDIATELY BECAME TURBID AND ON STANDING A DENSE FLUID SETTLED TO THE BOTTOM AND WHICH WHEN THE BOTTLE WAS HASTILY INVERTED FELL THROUGH THE SPIRIT OF WINE IN ROUND DROPS LIKE A PONDEROUS OIL THE SUPERNATANT SPIRIT OF WINE BEING CAREFULLY DECANTED OFF SOME DISTILLED WATER WAS ADDED TO THIS THICK FLUID BY WHICH IT WAS WHOLLY DISSOLVED THIS SOLUTION EXPOSED TO THE AIR SHEWED PHAENOMENA EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE UNDILUTED SOLUTION D THE DECANTED SPIRIT BEING ALSO LEFT EXPOSED TO THE AIR IN A SHALLOW GLASS VESSEL DID NOT AFTER MANY DAYS EITHER DEPOSIT A SENSIBLE QUANTITY OF PRECIPITATE OR BECOME GELATINOUS BUT HAV ING EVAPORATED NEARLY AWAY LEFT A FEW DROPS OF A LIQUOR WHICH MADE INFUSION OF RED CABBAGE GREEN AND ON THE ADDITION OF SOME PURE MARINE ACID EFFERVESCED VIOLENTLY NO PRECIPITATE FELL DURING THIS SATURATION WITH THE ACID NOR DID THE MIXTURE ON STANDING BECOME A JELLY AND ON THE TOTAL EVAPORATION OF THE FLUID PART A SMALL QUANTITY OF MURIATE OF TARTAR ONLY REMAINED THE SPIRIT OF WINE SEEMS THEREFORE TO HAVE DISSOLVED MERELY A PORTION OF SUPERABUNDANT ALKALI PRESENT IN THE MIXTURE BUT NONE OF THAT UNITED WITH TABASHEER F TO DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF THIS SOLUTION WERE ADDED SOME PURE MARINE ACID SOME PURE WHITE VITRIOLIC ACID AND SOME DISTILLED VINEGAR EACH IN EXCESS THESE ACIDS AT FIRST PRO DUCED NEITHER HEAT EFFERVESCENCE ANY PRECIPITATE OR THE LEAST SENSIBLE EFFECT EXCEPT THE VITRIOLIC ACID WHICH THREW DOWN A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF A WHITE MATTER BUT AFTER STANDING SOME DAYS THESE MIXTURES CHANGED INTO JELLIES SO FIRM THAT THESOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 377 THE GLASSES CONTAINING THEM WERE INVERTED WITHOUT THEIR FALLING OUT THIS CHANGE INTO JELLY EQUALLY TOOK PLACE WHETHER THE MIX TURES WERE KEPT IN OPEN OR CLOSED VESSELS WERE EXPOSED TO THE LIGHT OR SECLUDED FROM IT NOR DID IT SEEM TO BE MUCH PRO MOTED BY BOILING THE MIXTURES G SOME SOLUTION OF MILD VOLATILE ALKALI IN DISTILLED WATER BEING ADDED TO SOME OF THIS SOLUTION SEEMED AT THE FIRST INSTANT OF MIXTURE TO HAVE NO EFFECT UPON IT BUT IN THE SPACE OF A SECOND OR TWO IT OCCASIONED A COPIOUS WHITE PRECIPITATE H THE FLAKES REMAINING ON THE GLASSES AT D AND E PUT INTO MARINE ACID RAISED A SLIGHT EFFERVESCENCE BUT DID NOT DIS SOLVE THESE FLAKES WHEN TAKEN OUT OF THE ACID AND WELL WASHED WERE FOUND LIKE THE ORIGINAL TABASHEER TO BE WHITE AND OPAQUE WHEN DRY BUT TO BECOME TRANSPARENT WHEN MOISTENED AND THEN TO SHEW THE BLUE AND FLAME COLOUR  II A I THE JELLIES F DILUTED WITH WATER AND COLLECTED ON A FILTER APPEARED TO BE THE TABASHEER UNCHANGED  X A BIT OF TABASHEER WEIGHING TWOTENTHS OF A GRAIN WAS BOILED IN 127 GR OF STRONG CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALI FOR A CON SIDERABLE TIME BUT AFTER BEING MADE RED HOT IT HAD NOT SUSTAINED THE LEAST DIMINUTION OF WEIGHT  XI A 27 GR OF TABASHEER REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WERE PUT INTO AN OPEN TIN VESSEL WITH 100 GR OF CRYSTALS OF SODA AND SOME DISTILLED WATER AND THIS MIXTURE WAS MADE BOIL FOR THREE HOURS THE CLEAR LIQUOR WAS THEN POURED OFF AND THE TABASHEER WAS DIGESTED IN SOME PURE MARINE ACID AFTER SOME TIME THIS ACID WAS DECANTED AND THE TABASHEER WASHED WITH DISTILLED WATER WHICH WAS THEN ADDED TO THE ACID VOL LXXXI D D D B THIS378 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF B THIS TABASHEER WAS PUT BACK INTO THE ALKALINE SOLUTION WHICH SEEMED NOT IMPAIRED BY THE FOREGOING PROCESS AND AGAIN BOILED FOR A CONSIDERABLE TIME THE LIQUOR WAS THEN POURED FROM IT WHILE HOT AND THE TABASHEER EDULCORATED WITH SOME COLD DISTILLED WATER WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS MIXED WITH THIS HOT SOLUTION IN WHICH IT INSTANTLY CAUSED A PRECIPITATION ON HEATING THE MIXTURE IT BECAME CLEAR AGAIN BUT AS IT COOLED IT CHANGED WHOLLY INTO A THIN JELLY BUT IN THE COURSE OF A FEW DAYS IT SEPARATED INTO TWO PORTIONS THE JELLY SETTLING IN A DENSER STATE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL LEAVING A LIMPID LIQUOR OVER IT C THE TABASHEER REMAINING B WAS BOILED IN PURE MARINE ACID THE ACID WAS THEN POURED OFF AND THE TABASHEER EDULCO RATED WITH SOME DISTILLED WATER WHICH WAS AFTERWARDS MIXED WITH THE ACID D THE REMAINING TABASHEER COLLECTED WASHED AND DRIED WEIGHED 24 GR AND SEEMED NOT TO BE ALTERED E THE ACID LIQUORS A AND C WERE MIXED TOGETHER AND SATURATED WITH SODA BUT AFFORDED NO PRECIPITATE F THE ALKALINE MIXTURE B WAS POURED UPON A FILTER THE CLEAR LIQUOR CAME THROUGH LEAVING THE JELLY ON THE PAPER SOME OF THIS CLEAR LIQUOR EXPOSED TO THE AIR IN A SAUCER AT THE END OF SOME DAYS DEPOSITED A SMALL QUANTITY OF A GELA TINOUS MATTER AFTER SOME DAYS MORE THE WHOLE FLUID PART EXHALED AND THE SAUCER BECAME COVERED WITH REGULAR CRYSTALS OF SODA WHICH AFFORDED NO PRECIPITATE DURING THEIR SOLUTION IN VITRIOLIC ACID WHAT HAD APPEARED LIKE A JELLY WHILE MOIST ASSUMED ON DRYING THE FORM OF A WHITE POWDER THIS POW DER WAS INSOLUBLE IN VITRIOLIC ACID AND SEEMED STILL TO BE TABASHEER SOMESOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 379 SOME OF THIS CLEAR LIQUOR MIXED WITH MARINE ACID EFFER VESCED DID NOT AFFORD ANY PRECIPITATE BUT ON STANDING SOME DAYS THE MIXTURE BECAME SLIGHTLY GELATINOUS G SOME OF THE THICK JELLY REMAINING ON THE FILTER BEING BOILED IN WATER AND IN MARINE ACID APPEARED INSOLUBLE IN BOTH AND SEEMED TO AGREE ENTIRELY WITH THE ABOVE POWDER F WITH DRY ALKALIES  XII A TABASHEER MELTED ON THE CHARCOAL AT THE BLOW PIPE WITH SODA WITH CONSIDERABLE EFFERVESCENCE WHEN THE PRO PORTION OF ALKALI WAS LARGE THE TABASHEER QUICKLY DISSOLVED AND THE WHOLE SPREAD ON THE COAL SOAKED INTO IT AND VANISHED BUT BY ADDING THE ALKALI TO THE BIT OF TABASHEER IN EX CEEDINGLY SMALL QUANTITIES AT A TIME THIS SUBSTANCE WAS CON VERTED INTO A PEARL OF CLEAR COLOURLESS GLASS B 5 GR OF TABASHEER REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WERE MELTED IN A PLATINA CRUCIBLE WITH 100 GR OF CRYSTALS OF SODA THE MASS OBTAINED WAS WHITE AND OPAQUE AND WEIGHED 402 GR PUT INTO AN OUNCE OF DISTILLED WATER IT WHOLLY DISSOLVED AN EXCESS OF MARINE ACID LET FALL INTO THIS SOLUTION PRODUCED AN EFFERVESCENCE AND CHANGED IT INTO A JELLY THIS MIXTURE WAS STIRRED ABOUT AND THEN THROWN UPON A FILTER THE JELLY LEFT ON THE PAPER DID NOT DISSOLVE IN MARINE ACID BY EBULLITION COL LECTED WASHED WITH DISTILLED WATER AND DRIED IT WEIGHED 45 GR AND SEEMED TO BE THE TABASHEER UNALTERED THE LIQUOR WHICH HAD COME THROUGH BEING SATURATED WITH MINERAL ALKALI YIELDED ONLY A VERY SMALL QUANTITY OF A RED PRE CIPITATE WHICH WAS THE COLOURING MATTER OF THE PINK BLOTTING PAPER THROUGH WHICH IT HAD BEEN PASSED D D D 2 C 10380 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF C 10 GR OF TABASHEER REDUCED TO POWDER WERE MIXED WITH AN EQUAL WEIGHT OF SODA DEPRIVED OF ITS WATER OF CRY STALLIZATION BY HEAT THIS MIXTURE WAS PUT INTO A PLATINA CRU CIBLE AND EXPOSED TO A STRONG FIRE FOR 15 IT WAS THEN FOUND CONVERTED INTO A TRANSPARENT GLASS OF A SLIGHT YELLOW COLOUR THIS GLASS WAS BROKEN INTO PIECES AND BOILED IN MARINE ACID NO EFFERVESCENCE APPEARED BUT THE GLASS WAS DISSOLVED INTO A JELLY THIS JELLY COLLECTED ON A FILTER WELL WASHED AND DRIED WEIGHED 77 GR THE ACID LIQUOR WHICH CAME THROUGH ON SATURATION WITH SODA AFFORDED NOT THE LEAST PRECIPITATE BUT AFTER STANDING A DAY OR TWO IT CHANGED INTO A THIN JELLY THIS COLLECTED ON A FILTER WAS WASHED WITH DISTILLED WATER AND THEN BOILED IN MA RINE ACID BUT DID NOT DISSOLVE BEING AGAIN EDULCORATED AND MADE RED HOT IT WEIGHED 16 GR THE FILTERED LIQUOR B WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE CHANGED SIMILARLY TO A JELLY HAD IT BEEN KEPT THESE PRECIPITATES WERE ANALOGOUS TO THOSE  IX I D AN EQUAL WEIGHT OF VEGETABLE ALKALI AND TABASHEER WERE MELTED TOGETHER IN THE PLATINA CRUCIBLE THE GLASS PRO DUCED WAS TRANSPARENT BUT IT HAD A FIERY TASTE AND SOON AT TRACTED THE MOISTURE OF THE AIR AND DISSOLVED INTO A THICK LIQUOR BUT TWO PARTS OF VEGETABLE ALKALI WITH THREE OF TA BASHEER YIELDED A TRANSPARENT GLASS WHICH WAS PERMANENT TREATED WITH OTHER FLUXES  XIII A A FRAGMENT OF TABASHEER PUT INTO GLASS OF BORAX AND URGED AT THE BLOWPIPE CONTRACTED VERY CONSIDERABLY IN SIZE THE SAME AS WHEN HEATED PER SE AFTER WHICH IT CONTI NUED TURNING ABOUT IN THE FLUX DISSOLVING WITH GREAT DIFFICULTY 1 ANDSOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 381 AND VERY SLOWLY WHEN THE SOLUTION WAS EFFECTED THE SALINE PEARL REMAINED PERFECTLY CLEAR AND COLOURLESS B WITH PHOSPHORIC AMMONIAC MADE BY SATURATING THE ACID OBTAINED BY THE SLOW COMBUSTION OF PHOSPHORUS WITH CAUSTIC VOLATILE ALKALI THE TABASHEER VERY READILY MELTED ON THE CHAR COAL AT THE BLOWPIPE WITH EFFERVESCENCE INTO A WHITE FROTHY BEAD C FUSED BY THE SAME MEANS ON A PLATE OF PLATINA WITH THE VITRIOLS OF TARTAR AND SODA IT APPEARED ENTIRELY TO RESIST THEIR ACTION THE LITTLE PARTICLES EMPLOYED CONTINUING TO REVOLVE IN THE FLUID GLOBULES WITHOUT SUSTAINING ANY SENSIBLE DIMINUTION OF SIZE AND THE SALINE BEADS ON COOLING ASSUMED THEIR USUAL OPACITY D A BIT OF TABASHEER WAS LAID ON A PLATE OF SILVER AND A LITTLE LITHARGE WAS PUT OVER IT AND THEN MELTED WITH THE BLOW PIPE IT IMMEDIATELY ACTED ON THE TABASHEER AND COVERED IT WITH A WHITE GLASSY GLAZING BY THE ADDITION OF MORE LITHARGE THE MASS WAS BROUGHT TO A ROUND BEAD THOUGH WITH CONSIDERA BLE DIFFICULTY THIS BEAD BORE MELTING ON THE CHARCOAL WITH OUT ANY REDUCTION OF THE LEAD BUT COULD NOT BE OBTAINED TRANSPARENT E THE EASE WITH WHICH THIS SUBSTANCE HAD MELTED WITH VEGETABLE ASHES LED TO THE TRIAL OF IT WITH PURE CALCAREOUS EARTH A FRAGMENT OF TABASHEER FIXED TO THE END OF A BIT OF GLASS WAS RUBBED OVER WITH SOME POWDERED WHITING AS SOON AS EXPOSED TO THE FLAME OF THE BLOWPIPE IT MELTED WITH CONSI DERABLE EFFERVESCENCE BUT COULD NOT EVEN ON THE CHARCOAL AND WITH THE ADDITION OF MORE WHITING BE BROUGHT TO A TRANSPARENT STATE OR REDUCED INTO A ROUND BEAD EQUAL WEIGHTS OF TABASHEER AND PURE CALCAREOUS SPAR BOTH REDUCED TO FINE POWDER WERE IRREGULARLY MIXED AND EXPOSED IN382 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF IN THE PLATINA CRUCIBLE TO A STRONG FIRE IN A FORGE FOR 20 BUT DID NOT EVEN CONCRETE TOGETHER F WHEN MAGNESIA WAS USED NO FUSION TOOK PLACE AT THE BLOWPIPE G EQUAL PARTS OF TABASHEER WHITING AND EARTH OF ALUM PRECIPITATED BY MILD VOLATILE ALKALI WERE MIXED IN A STATE OF POWDER AND SUBMITTED IN THE PLATINA CRUCIBLE TO A STRONG FIRE FOR 20 BUT WERE AFTERWARDS FOUND UNMELTED EXAMINATION OF THE OTHER SPECIMENS NO 1 THIS PARCEL CONTAINED PARTICLES OF THREE KINDS SOME WHITE OF A SMOOTH TEXTURE MUCH RESEMBLING THE FOREGOING SORT OTHERS OF THE SAME APPEARANCE BUT YELLOWISH AND OTHERS GREATLY SIMILAR TO BITS OF DRIED MOULD THE WHITE AND YELLOWISH PIECES WERE SO SOFT AS TO BE VERY EASILY RUBBED TO POWDER BETWEEN THE FINGERS THEY HAD A DISAGREE BLE TASTE SOMETHING LIKE THAT OF RHUBARB PUT INTO WATER THE WHITE BITS SCARCELY GREW AT ALL TRANSPARENT BUT THE YELLOW ONES BECAME SO TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE THE BROWN EARTHLIKE PIECES WERE HARDER THAN THE ABOVE HAD LITTLE TASTE FLOATED UPON WATER AND REMAINED OPAQUE EXPOSED TO THE BLOWPIPE THEY ALL CHARRED AND GREW BLACK THE LAST VARIETY EVEN BURNED WITH A FLAME WHEN THE VEGETABLE MATTER WAS CONSUMED THE PIECES REMAINED WHITE AND THEN HAD EXACTLY THE APPEARANCE AND POSSESSED ALL THE PROPERTIES OF THE THE FOREGOING TABASHEER FROM HYDRABAD AND LIKE IT MELTED WITH SODA INTO A TRANSPARENT GLASS NO IISOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 383 NO II ALSO CONSISTED OF BITS OF THREE SORTS A SOME WHITE NEARLY OPAQUE B A FEW SMALL VERY TRANSPARENT PARTICLES SHEWING IN AN EMINENT DEGREE THE BLUE AND YELLOW COLOUR BY THE DIFFERENT DIRECTION OF LIGHT C COARSE BROWNISH PIECES OF A GRAINED TEXTURE THESE ALL HAD EXACTLY THE SAME TASTE HARDNESS C AND SHEWED THE SAME EFFECTS AT THE BLOWPIPE AS N I 27 GR OF THIS TABASHEER THROWN INTO A REDHOT CRUCIBLE BURNED WITH A YELLOWISH WHITE FLAME LOST 29 GR IN WEIGHT AND BECAME SO SIMILAR TO THE HYDRABAD KIND AS NOT TO BE DISTIN GUISHED FROM IT SOME OF THIS TABASHEER PUT INTO A CRUCIBLE NOT MADE VERY HOT EMITTED A SMELL SOMETHING LIKE TOBACCO ASHES BUT NOT THE KIND OF PERFUME DISCOVERED IN THAT FROM HYDRABAD  IV E NO IV ALL THE PIECES OF THIS PARCEL WERE OF ONE APPEARANCE AND A GOOD DEAL RESEMBLED IN THEIR TEXTURE THE THIRD VARIETY OF NO II THEIR COLOUR WAS WHITE THEIR HARDNESS SUCH AS VERY DIFFI CULTLY TO BE BROKEN BY PRESSURE BETWEEN THE FINGERS IN THE MOUTH THEY IMMEDIATELY FELL TO A PULPY POWDER AND HAD NO TASTE A BIT EXPOSED ON THE CHARCOAL TO THE BLOWPIPE BECAME BLACK MELTED LIKE SOME VEGETABLE MATTERS CAUGHT FLAME AND BURNT TO A BOTRYOID INFLATED COAL WHICH SOON ENTIRELY CONSUMED AWAY AND VANISHED A PIECE PUT INTO WATER FELL TO A POWDER THE MIXTURE BEING BOILED THIS POWDER DISSOLVED AND TURNED THE WHOLE TO A JELLY THESE384 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF THESE PROPERTIES ARE EXACTLY THOSE OF COMMON STARCH NO V AGREED ENTIRELY WITH NO IV IN APPEARANCE PROPERTIES AND NATURE NO VI THE PIECES OF THIS PARCEL WERE WHITE QUITE OPAQUE AND CON SIDERABLY HARD THEIR TASTE AND EFFECTS AT THE BLOWPIPE WERE PERFECTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE HYDRABAD KIND NO VII MUCH RESEMBLED NO VI ONLY WAS RATHER SOFTER AND SEEMED TO BLACKEN A LITTLE WHEN FIRST HEATED WITH FLUXES AT THE BLOW PIPE IT SHEWED THE SAME EFFECTS AS ALL THE ABOVE CONCLUSION 1 IT APPEARS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT ALL THE PARCELS EXCEPT NO IV AND V CONSISTED OF GENUINE TABASHEER BUT THAT THOSE KINDS IMMEDIATELY TAKEN FROM THE PLANT CONTAINED A CERTAIN PORTION OF A VEGETABLE MATTER WHICH WAS WANTING IN THE SPECIMENS PROCURED FROM THE SHOPS AND WHICH HAD PRO BABLY BEEN DEPRIVED OF THIS ADMIXTURE BY CALCINATION OF WHICH OPERATION A PARTIAL BLACKNESS OBSERVABLE ON SOME OF THE PIECES OF NO III AND VI ARE DOUBTLESS THE TRACES THIS ACCOUNTS ALSO FOR THE SUPERIOR HARDNESS AND DIMINISHED TASTES OF THESE SORTS 2 THE NATURE OF THIS SUBSTANCE IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED IN THE PRODUCT OF A VEGETABLE ITS INDESTRUCTIBILITY BY FIRE ITS TOTAL RESISTANCE TO ACIDS ITS UNITING BYSOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 385 BY FUSION WITH ALKALIES IN CERTAIN PROPORTIONS INTO A WHITE OPAQUE MASS IN OTHERS INTO A TRANSPARENT PERMANENT GLASS AND ITS BEING AGAIN SEPARABLE FROM THESE COMPOUNDS ENTIRELY UNCHANGED BY ACIDS C SEEM TO AFFORD THE STRONGEST REASONS TO CONSIDER IT AS PERFECTLY IDENTICAL WITH COMMON SILICEOUS EARTH YET FROM PURE QUARTZ IT MAY BE THOUGHT TO DIFFER IN SOME MATERIAL PARTICULARS SUCH AS IN ITS FUSING WITH CALCAREOUS EARTH IN SOME OF ITS EFFECTS WITH LIQUID ALKALIES IN ITS TASTE AND ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY BUT ITS TASTE MAY ARISE MERELY FROM ITS DIVIDED STATE FOR CHALK AND POWDERY MAGNESIA BOTH HAVE TASTES AND TASTES WHICH ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THAT OF PURE TABASHEER BUT WHEN THESE EARTHS ARE TAKEN IN THE DENSER STATE OF CRYSTALS THEY ARE FOUND TO BE QUITE INSIPID SO TABASHEER WHEN MADE MORE SOLID BY EXPOSURE TO A PRETTY STRONG HEAT IS NO LONGER PERCEIVED WHEN CHEWED TO ACT UPON THE PALATE  IV A AND ON ACCURATE COMPARISON ITS EFFECTS WITH LIQUID ALKA LIES HAVE NOT APPEARED PECULIAR FOR THOUGH IT WAS FOUND ON TRIAL THAT THE POWDER OF COMMON FLINTS WHEN BOILED IN SOME OF THE SAME LIQUID CAUSTIC ALKALI EMPLOYED AT  IX A WAS SCARCELY AT ALL ACTED UPON AND THAT THE VERY LITTLE WHICH WAS DISSOLVED WAS SOON PRECIPITATED AGAIN IN THE FORM OF MINUTE FLOCCULI ON EXPOSING THE SOLUTION TO THE AIR AND WAS IMME DIATELY THROWN DOWN ON THE ADMIXTURE OF AN ACID YET THE PRECIPITATE OBTAINED FROM LIQUOR SILICUM BY MARINE ACID WAS DIS COVERED EVEN WHEN DRY TO DISSOLVE READILY IN THIS ALKALI BUT WHILE STILL MOIST TO DO SO VERY COPIOUSLY EVEN WITHOUT THE ASSIST ANCE OF HEAT AND SOME OF THIS SOLUTION THUS SATURATED WITH SILICEOUS MATTER BY EBULLITION BEING EXPOSED TO THE AIR IN A SHALLOW GLASS BECAME A JELLY BY THE NEXT DAY AND THE DAY AFTER DRIED AND CRACKED C EXACTLY LIKE THE MIXTURES  IX VOL LXXXI E E E D AND386 MR MACIES ACCOUNT OF D AND E AND ANOTHER PORTION OF THIS SOLUTION MIXED WITH MARINE ACID AFFORDED NO PRECIPITATE AND REMAINED PERFECTLY UN AFFECTED FOR TWO DAYS BUT ON THE THIRD IT WAS CONVERTED INTO A FIRM JELLY LIKE THAT  IX F AS GYPSUM IS FOUND TO MELT PER SE AT THE BLOWPIPE THOUGH REFRACTORY TO THE STRONGEST HEAT THAT CAN BE MADE IN A FURNACE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT POSSIBLY SILICEOUS AND CALCAREOUS EARTHS MIGHT FLUX TOGETHER BY THIS MEANS THOUGH THEY RESIST THE UTMOST POWER OF COMMON FIRES BUT EXPERIMENT SHEWED THAT IN THIS RESPECT QUARTZ DID NOT AGREE WITH TABASHEER BUT THIS DIFFER ENCE SEEMS MUCH TOO LIKELY TO DEPEND ON THE ADMIXTURE OF A LITTLE FOREIGN MATTER IN THE LATTER BODY TO ADMIT OF ITS BEING MADE THE GROUNDS FOR CONSIDERING IT AS A NEW SUBSTANCE IN OPPOSITION TO SO MANY MORE MATERIAL POINTS IN WHICH IT AGREES WITH SILEX NOR CAN MUCH WEIGHT BE LAID ON THE INFERIOR SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF A BODY SO VERY POROUS THE INFUSIBILITY OF THE MIXTURE  XIII G DEPENDED ALSO PROBABLY EITHER ON AN INACCURACY IN THE PROPORTIONS OF THE EARTHS TO EACH OTHER OR ON A DEFICIENCY OF HEAT 3 OF THE THREE BAMBOOS WHICH WERE NOT SPLIT BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY I HAVE OPENED TWO THE TABASHEER FOUND IN THEM AGREED ENTIRELY IN ITS PROPERTIES WITH THAT OF NO I AND II IT WAS OBSERVED THAT ALL THE TABASHEER IN THE SAME JOINT WAS EXACTLY OF THE SAME APPEARANCE IN ONE JOINT IT WAS ALL SIMILAR TO THE YELLOWISH SORT NO I IN ANOTHER JOINT OF THE SAME BAMBOO IT RESEMBLED THE VARIETY C OF NO II PROBABLY THEREFORE THE PARCELS FROM DR RUSSELL CONTAINING EACH SEVE RAL VARIETIES OF THIS SUBSTANCE AROSE FROM THE PRODUCE OF MANY JOINTS HAVING BEEN MIXED TOGETHER 4 THESOME CHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS ON TABASHEER 387 4 THE ASHES OBTAINED BY BURNING THE BAMBOO BOILED IN MARINE ACID LEFT A VERY LARGE QUANTITY OF A WHITISH INSOLUBLE POWDER WHICH FUSED AT THE BLOWPIPE WITH SODA EFFERVESCED AND FORMED A TRANSPARENT GLASS ONLY THE MIDDLE PART OF THE JOINTS WAS BURNED THE KNOTS WERE SAWED OFF LEST BEING PO ROUS TABASHEER MIGHT BE MECHANICALLY LODGED IN THEM HOW EVER THE GREAT QUANTITY OF THIS REMAINING SUBSTANCE SHEWS IT TO BE AN ESSENTIAL CONSTITUENT PART OF THE WOOD THE ASHES OF COMMON CHARCOAL DIGESTED IN MARINE ACID LEFT IN THE SAME MANNER AN INSOLUBLE RESIDUUM WHICH FUSED WITH SODA WITH EFFERVESCENCE AND FORMED GLASS BUT THE PROPORTION OF THIS MATTER TO THE ASHES WAS GREATLY LESS THAN IN THE FOREGOING CASE 5 SINCE THE ABOVE EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE A SINGULAR CIRCUMSTANCE HAS PRESENTED ITSELF A GREEN BAMBOO CUT IN THE HOTHOUSE OF DR PITCAIRN AT ISLINGTON WAS JUDGED TO CON TAIN TABASHEER IN ONE OF ITS JOINTS FROM A RATTLING NOISE DIS COVERABLE ON SHAKING IT BUT BEING SPLIT BY SIR JOSEPH BANKS IT WAS FOUND TO CONTAIN NOT ORDINARY TABASHEER BUT A SOLID PEBBLE ABOUT THE SIZE OF HALF A PEA EXTERNALLY THIS PEBBLE WAS OF AN IRREGULAR ROUNDED FORM OF A DARKBROWN OR BLACK COLOUR INTERNALLY IT WAS REDDISHBROWN OF A CLOSE DULL TEXTURE MUCH LIKE SOME MARTIAL SILICEOUS STONES IN ONE CORNER THERE WERE SHINING PARTICLES WHICH APPEARED TO BE CRYSTALS BUT TOO MINUTE TO BE DISTINGUISHED EVEN WITH THE MICROSCOPE THIS SUBSTANCE WAS SO HARD AS TO CUT GLASS A FRAGMENT OF IT EXPOSED TO THE BLOWPIPE ON THE CHARCOAL DID NOT GROW WHITE CONTRACT IN SIZE MELT OR UNDERGO ANY CHANGE PUT INTO BORAX IT DID NOT DISSOLVE BUT LOST ITS COLOUR E E E 2 AND388 MR MACIES ACCOUNT C AND TINGED THE FLUX GREEN WITH SODA IT EFFERVESCED AND FORMED A ROUND BEAD OF OPAQUE BLACK GLASS THESE TWO BEADS DIGESTED IN SOME PERFECTLY PURE AND WHITE MARINE ACID ONLY PARTIALLY DISSOLVED AND TINGED THIS MENSTRUUM OF A GREENISH YELLOW COLOUR AND FROM THIS SOLUTION PRUSSITE OF TARTAR SO PURE AS NOT UNDER MANY HOURS TO PRODUCE A BLUE COLOUR WITH THE ABOVE PURE MARINE ACID INSTANTLY THREW DOWN A VERY COPIOUS PRUSSIAN BLUE P S IN ASCERTAINING THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THE HYDRABAD TABASHEER  I G GREAT CARE WAS TAKEN IN BOTH THE EXPERI MENTS THAT EVERY BIT WAS THOROUGHLY PENETRATED WITH THE WATER AND TRANSPARENT TO ITS VERY CENTER BEFORE ITS WEIGHT IN THE WATER WAS DETERMINED

j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098452,Testimony of a Deceased Witness in Criminal Cases,i245833,TESTIMONY OF DECEASED WITNESS Notwithstanding the general rule as stated in the beginning is based upon the idea that the relation of master and servant does not exist The writer has not found any case directly deciding the point but in Bibbs case we find this significant language  It can but be obvi ous to every impartial mind that when any person     has in the exercise of due care and caution selected a competent and skillful con tractor c Whilst this is an obiter yet the fact was noticed and seems to have been in the mind of the court that there was no lack of such care and caution But if the owner under the general rule is exempt from liability for the negligence of this contractor and none of the other six circum stances above mentioned exist upon what principle of responsibility or existing relationship can an injured party complain that the owner was not prudent in his selection of an independent responsible will to accomplish a given work Is it not presumed that the owner would engage and had engaged a reasonably careful and competent contractor in the outset  GEO E CASSEL East Radford Va Jan 27 1897 TESTIMONY OF A DEC1ASFn WITNESS IN CRIMINAL A SFlS There is no question as to the rule that in a civil action testimony is admissible to show what a witness since deceased stated on a pre vious trial between the same parties and on the same issue It was formerly held and is perhaps still the rule in England based upon a dictum of Lord Kenyon that the whole of the deceased witness testimony must be given in his precise words but now in the United States the almost universal rule is that it is sufficient to give the substance of what the witness stated Caton v Lenox 5 Rand 36 It was also formerly held that such testimony was only admissible in case of the death of the witness but now the rule is not so strict and such evidence is usually admitted where the witness is beyond the jurisdiction of the court has become insane cannot be found or has been removed by the procurement of the other party though there is great conflict on this point 1897 807VIRGINIA LAW REGISTEL The rule admitting such testimony is based on the fact that the statements of the witness on the former trial were made under oath in the presence of the party and he had an opportunity to crossexamine The subsequent cause must be between the same parties or their privies or representatives and on the same issue In Virginia this rule while applied to civil cases has always been held to have no application to criminal cases The last case on the subject is Brogys Case 10 Gratt 722 732 This case rests entirely on Finns Case 5 Rand 701 on this point and cites no other authority It was decided in 1853 In Finns Case 5 Rand 701 on page 708 the opinion reads In a civil action if a witness who has been examined in a former trial between the same parties and on the same issue is since dead what he swore to on the former trial may be given in evidence for the evidence was given on oath and the party had an opportunity of crossexamining him   But we cannot find that the rule has ever been allowed in a criminal case indeedit is said to be expressly otherwise Peake 60 quoting Fenwicks Case 4 St Trials This case was decided in 1827 Norris Peake p 90 says Even the evidence which a witness gave on a fo mer trial between the same parties has after his death been read in a civil action the foundation being laid for it by the pro duction of the postea But this is not allowed in a criminal prosecu tion And in other cases the witness who is to prove what is sworn should give the precise words and not what he supposes to be the effect of the evidence The only authority which Peake cites in this regard is Fenwicks Case 4 St Trials 265 5 Hargraves St Trials 39 On this point we refer to the excellent notes of Cowen  Hill to Phillips Evidence In Book 3 p 323 Note 205 the author says In the second case i e Finns Case Peakes Ev 60 is cited who refers to Fenwicks Case    It is true that Peake relies on that case as proving that such evidence is inadmissible in a criminal pro ceeding but he is followed by no other writer and the case itself car ries the rule even farther against a criminal than was ever done against a party in a civil cause Fenwicks Case does not seem to apply to this question at all It was a bill of attainder brought against Sir John Fenwick for high treason in that he was conspiring against William to restore James There were two witnesses Porter and Goodman on whose testimony 808 MarchTESTIMONY OF DECEASED WITNESS an indictment had been found against him and who had made their statements before a magistrate under oath as to the conspiracy One of the witnesses Goodman was removed from England through the efforts of Lady Fenwick who it seemed acted at the instance of her husband The law required the testimony of two witnesses to convict of trea son and therefore as one of the witnesses had been removed Fenwick could not be convicted by trial at law To overcome this obstacle he was brought before Parliament on a bill of attainder for the reason that Parliament was not bound by any statute nor by any rules of evi dence On that trial before Parliament the Kings Counsel offered to prove the statements of the absent witness Goodman given before the mag istrate when Fenwick was not present and had no opportunity to crossexamine and also the testimony of Goodman given on the trial of Cook a fellowconspirator with Fenwick which evidence equally inculpated Fenwick It was agreed on all sides that such evidence was not admissible in a law court but they considered that Parliament was not bound down to forms of law and the testimony was heard It will be easily seen that this case is not in point 1st Because tried before Parliament which did not recognize any rules of evidence as administered in the law courts as binding upon it and it was for the very purpose of evading these rules that the case was brought before Parliament 2d The witness Goodman was removed at the instance and by the procurement of Fenwick 3d Goodman was merely out of the jurisdiction of the court and not a deceased witness 4th The statements of Goodman before the magistrate were not made in the presence of Fenwick and he therefore had no opportunity to cross examine so that the prisoner was not confronted by his accuser as required by Magna Charta 5th The testimony of Goodman given on the trial of Cook while it may have equally inculpated Fenwick was not given on a trial between the same parties so that one of the essential requisites for the admission of the evidence was lacking So we find that Fenwicks Case offers no precedent for the proposi tion where a witness is examined in a criminal trial and the accused is present and has opportunity to crossexamine and contradict that if the witness dies his testimony cannot be proved in a subsequent trial between the same parties on the same issue Judge Brockenbrough says in his opinion in Finns Case that they 1897 809VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER cannot find that such evidence had ever been received in a criminal case In Rex v Jolliffe 4 Term Rep 285 decided in 1791 the rule is thus stated by Lord Kenyon It has been said that in no case whatever can the proceedings in one cause be made use of in another but the contrary is in every days practice In the Court of Chancery depo sitions taken in one case are frequently read in another saving all just exceptions as that they are not between other parties c So in courts of law the evidence which a witness gave on a former trial may be used in a subsequent one if he die in the interim as I remember was agreed on all hands in a trial at bar in the instance of Lord Pal merston but as the person who wished to give Lord Palmerstons evidence could not undertake to give his words but merely to swear to the effect of them he was rejected This was a criminal case and was decided long prior to Finns Case See also the Information against Buckworth T Raym 170 In Commonwealth v Richards Mass 29 Am Dec 608 the rule is very clearly and forcibly stated that when on a former trial the ac cused is faced by the witness and has an opportunity to crossexamine evidence of what the deceased witness swore to is admissible on a sub sequent trial of the same party on the same charge and that this is no violation of the constitutional provision that the accused must be con fronted with the witnesses against him But the case also holds that the whole testimony of the deceased witness must be given in his own words and not merely the substance of what he swore to Citing the Case of Buckworth T Raym 170 An examination of the American authorities shows that they are overwhelmingly in favor of the admissibility of such evidence in crimi nal cases See the American notes to Roscoes Criminal Evidence new edition p 104 where the authorities are collected and it would seem that Virginia is the only exception to the rule Whartons Law of Evidence sec 177 et seq and notes where it is stated that the rule is the same in criminal cases see especially Whartons Ameri can Criminal Law sec 667 and note where Fenwicks Case is com mented on and distinguished and where it is stated that the substance of the deceased witness testimony is sufficient Greenleaf on Evidence sec 163 et seq Chamberlaynes Best on Evidence p 448 and Mays edition of Stephens Digest of the Law of Evidence pp 8990 But see case of U S v Angell 11 Fed Rep 34 where a distinction is made between a deceased witness and an absent witness In bbth Brogys Case and Finns Case the witnesses were not dead 810 MarchTESTIMONY OF DECEASED WITNESS but had removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court and while in Finns Case the court held that the rule excluding the evidence applied as well to a deceased witness as to an absent witness yet this question was not necessary to the decision of the case and the opinion of the court as to that point was obiter dictum In Crites Case reported in 5 Va Law Journal p 568 but which for some reason was not published in the official reports the Virginia court held citing Brogys Case and Finns Case that evidence of a witness since removed beyond the jurisdiction of the court taken be fore a coroner could not be read on the trial of the accused but puts a qucere as to a dead witness The court lays stress on the fact that the evidence was taken before a coroner where perhaps a full and accurate disclosure of the facts known to the witness would not be given as would be done if taken on a trial in the presence of the ac cused and subject to crossexamination by counsel and states that the objection to such evidence in a case like this is much greater than if it had been taken at a former trial and in the presence of the accused and his counsel The same rule as to testimony given before a coroner is followed in Whitehursts Case 79 Va 556 which cites Crites Case It will be seen however that in both Crites Case and Whitehursts Case the tes timony was not given in a former trial but before a coroner and that the witnesses were not dead but merely beyond the jurisdiction of the court See 9 Va Law Journal p 700 also 10 Id 255 In the case of an absent witness in some States the difficulty might perhaps be overcome by taking his deposition but it would seem that in the case of a dead witness the necessity of the case is sufficient justification for a departure from the strict rules of evidence as is done in the case of dying declarations for the reason that otherwise most vital testimony might be lost The authorities are almost unanimous in favor of the admission of such evidence and it does not seem that there is any sufficient reason to justify its exclusion It is clearly admissible in civil cases and there is no difference between the general rules of evidence in civil and criminal cases It cannot be objected that the accused is not confronted with the witness against him for he hears the testimony in both trials and has opportunity to crossexamine and deny in both Moreover in cases of homicide the dying declarations of the deceased in regard to 1897 811VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the circumstances of the killing are received against the accused though he has had no opportunity to crossexamine The rule excluding this evidence throws an unreasonable safeguard around the criminal and an unnecessary burden on the Common wealth for the reason that the burden of proof is on the Commonwealth and the absence of testimony will bear more heavily on that side and moreover the rule might work great hardship on the accused if his most important and it might be his only witness had died and no evidence could be received at the subsequent trial of what his testi mony had been on the previous one This is especially likely to hap pen in these days of frequent appeals and new trials All the requisites for valid testimony are present the accused is present and can crossexamine and deny the witnesses in both trials are under oath and liable for perjury if they swear falsely It cannot be objected that it is too dangerous a practice to allow viva voce testimony as to what was sworn to by a witness on a previous trial for the same thing is done continually in cases of perjury and men convicted upon it and moreover in such cases the exact words of what the accused swore are not required to be given but merely the substance of his testimony Under the modern system of law reporting and official stenogra phers it is now very easy to produce with the utmost exactness the testimony given on a trial by a witness and the same danger would not be incident to the admission of such testimony as would be under the old system and therefore there is not the same objection to it now as formerly According to the rule stare decisis it is now too late perhaps to question a rule of evidence that has been so long recognized in Vir ginia but we submit that the rule was established without sufficient authority in the first place is against the large preponderance of authority in this country now and is not justified by reason or expediency RUDOLPH BUMGARDNER Staunton Virginia 812 March

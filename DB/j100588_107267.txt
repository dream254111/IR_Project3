J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107267,AN ACCOUNT OF A CALCULUS FROM THE HUMAN BLADDER OF UNCOMMON MAGNITUDE,I206964,3 3 XVIII AN ACCOUNT OF A CALCULUS FROM THE HUMAN BLADDER OF UNCOMMON MAGNITUDE BY SIR JAMES EARLE F R 8 READ JUNE 15 1809 SIR WALTER OGILVIE BART OF DUNDEE AN OFFICER IN THE RE GIMENT OF SCOTCH GREYS AT THE AGE OF TWENTYTHREE ACTIVE AND HEALTHY WAS CROSSING THE FERRY AT LEITH WHEN HE RECEIVED A BLOW ON HIS BACK FROM THE BOOM OF THE VESSEL WHICH PARA LIZED THE PELVIS AND LOWER EXTREMITIES DURING TWO MONTHS HE WAS OBLIGED TO HAVE HIS WATER DRAWN OFF FOR FOURTEEN MONTHS HE REMAINED IN BED OR IN A HORIZONTAL POSTURE AND THOUGH HE THEN RECOVERED THE USE OF THE BLADDER AND OF HIS LIMBS SUFFICIENTLY TO WALK ACROSS THE ROOM WITH THE HELP OF CRUTCHES AND ALSO TO RIDE WHEN PLACED ON AN EASY LOW HORSE HIS HEALTH CONTINUED MANY YEARS IN A WEAK AND PRECARIOUS STATE WHILE THE LIMBS ACQUIRED LITTLE ADDITIONAL STRENGTH OR POWERS ABOUT TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE ACCIDENT PERCEIVING SYMPTOMS OF STONE IN THE BLADDER HE WAS EXAMINED BY MR BENJAMIN BELL AT EDINBURGH AND A STONE WAS FELT WHICH WAS JUDGED TO HAVE ATTAINED A CONSIDERABLE SIZE THE OPERATION OF EXTRAC TION WAS THEN RECOMMENDED BUT WAS POSTPONED FROM TIME TO TIME THOUGH HIS HEALTH DECLINED AND THE IRRITATION AND PAINS IN THE BLADDER GRADUALLY INCREASED SIR WALTER CONTINUED TO ENDURE THIS STATE OF EXISTENCE TWENTYEIGHT YEARS FROM THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT WHEN HE RR RSIR JAMES EARLES ACCOUNT OF A CALCULLS 304 BECAME UNABLE TO MAKE WATER IN AN ERECT POSITION THIS INCON VENIENCE INCREASED TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT LATTERLY HE COULD MAKE NONE WITHOUT STANDING ALMOST ON HIS HEAD SO AS TO CAUSE THE UPPER PART OF THE BLADDER TO BECOME THE LOWER AND THIS HE WAS OBLIGED TO DO FREQUENTLY SOMETIMES EVERY TEN MINUTES AS THE QUANTITY AT EACH TIME WAS LESS THAN THE MEASURE OF A WINE GLASS AND WHEN HE USED EXERCISE IT WAS TINGED WITH BLOOD THE PRINCIPAL REMEDIES WHICH HAD BEEN PRESCRIBED FOR HIM WERE AQUA CALCIS AND UVA URSI BUT HE NEVER PERSISTED LONG IN THE USE OF EITHER AT TIMES WHEN THE PAIIN WAS VIOLENT HE HAD RECOURSE TO OPIUM BY THE MOUTH AND PER ANUM THIS ADDED TO A NATURALLY COSTIVE HABIT OF BODY RENDERED NECESSARY THE FREQUENT ASSISTANCE OF APERIENTS AT THE AGE OF FIFTYTHREE THIRTY YEARS AFTER THE ACCIDENT THE SPASMS AND FITS OF PAIN FROM THE URGENT DESIRE TO VOID URINE BECAME SO FREQUENT AND VIOLENT AND HIS LIFE SO COMPLETELY MISERABLE THAT HE WAS DETERMINED TO HAVE THE STONE EXTRACTED I RECEIVED A LETTER REQUESTING MY OPINION WHETHER A PARALYTIC STATE OF THE LOWER LIMBS WAS A PROHIBITION TO THE OPERATION OF LITHOTOMY ON MY REPLY TO THE CONTRARY HE WAS PUT ON BOARD A SHIP AND CONVEYED TO THE THAMES BROUGHT IN A BOAT TO HUNGERFORD STAIRS AND IN AN EASY CARRIAGE TO HANOVERSTREET WITHOUT SUFFERING ANY INCONVENIENCE OF MATERIAL CONSEQUENCE TOWARD THE LATTER END OF JULY 188 I VISITED HIM WHEN HE GAVE ME A CLEAR AND DISTINCT ACCOUNT OF WHAT HAS BEEN RELATED AND ADDED THAT THE STONE COULD BE EVIDENTLY FELT ABOVE THE OS PUBIS AT FIRST I MUCH DOUBTED OF THE LARGE PROMINENT TUMOR WHICH I SAW IN THE LOWER PART OF THE BELLY BEING A STONE BUT ON ATTEMPTING TO PASS THE SOUND IT WOULD NOT ENTER THE BLADDERFROM THE HUMAN BLADDER BEING STOPPED BY A SOLID MASS AND ON FURTHER EXAMINATION I WAS THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THERE WAS A STONE OF SUFFI CIENT SIZE TO FILL THE BLADDER LIE SAID HE CAME TO ENGLAND WITH A DETERMINATION TO HAVE IT EXTRACTED IF IT WERE POSSIBLE AND DESIRED MY OPINION AS TO ITS PRACTICABILITY ON SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY AND IMPORTANT CASE I DECLINED AN IMMEDIATE ANSWER BUT REQUESTED A CONSULTATION AND MR CLINE WAS APPOINTED TO MEET ME AFTER MATURE CON SIDERATION OF EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE WE WERE OF OPINION THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF EXTRACTION MUST DEPEND ON THE CONSISTENCE OF THE STONE IF IT PROVED SOFT AS IS WELL KNOWN TO BE FREQUENTLY THE CASE IT MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY BUT IF TOO HARD TO BE BROKEN IT WOULD BE TOO LARGE TO BE EXTRACTED WHOLE AND MUST BE LEFT THE OPERATION OF EXTRACTING IT ABOVE THE OS PUBIS WAS THO ROUGHLY CONSIDERED AND CONCLUDED TO BE UNCERTAIN AND DAN GEROUS BECAUSE THE BLADDER THICKENED AND EXQUISITELY IRRITABLE COULD NOT BEAR TO BE FURTHER DISTENDED WITH FLUID AND THE STONE ALTHOUGH SO LARGE HAD NOT RAISED IT SUFFICIENTLY HIGH TO OBVIATE THE DANGER OF WOUNDING THE PERITONEUM AND PENE TRATING INTO THE CAVITY OF THE ABDOMEN THE USUAL LATERAL OPERATION WAS THEREFORE JUDGED TO BE THE ONLY SAFE AND PRO BABLE MEANS TO BE ATTEMPTED AFTER SOME DAYS CONSIDERATION SIR WALTER THOROUGHLY AND PERFECTLY AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH MIGHT REASONABLY BE APPREHENDED IN THE EXTRACTION FROM THE MAGNITUDE AND ALSO FROM THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE STRUCTURE AND CONSISTENCE OF THE STONE DETERMINED TO SUBMIT TO THE OPERATION AND MR CLINE WAS REQUESTED TO PERFORM IT ON THURSDAY AUGUST LTH HE WAS PLACED IN THE USUAL S05SSIR JAMES EARLES ACCOUNT OF A CALCULUS SITUATION AND THE PROPER LIGATURES WERE APPLIED BUT IT WAS SOON FOUND THAT THE LOWER LIMBS WERE SO INCAPABLE OF ACTION OR RESISTANCE THAT THEY WERE LEFT UNCONFINED THE STAFF COULD BE PASSED IN NO FARTHER THAN THE NECK OF THE BLADDER THE DI VISION OF THE URETHRA AND PROSTATE GLAND WAS MADE WITH THE SCALPEL AND PROBEPOINTED BISTOURI WHEN THIS WAS ACCOM PLISHED IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE TO INTRODUCE ANY KIND OF FOR CEPS BUT ON PRESSING HARD WITH THE FINGER PART OF THE STONE FELT SOFT GAVE WAY AND MADE SOME ROOM FOR THE FORCEPS WHICH BROUGHT AWAY SEVERAL PORTIONS AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF A SCOOP AS MUCH STONE WAS EXTRACTED AS WOULD HAVE FILLED A LARGE TEACUP BUT THE GREAT MASS BEYOND WHAT THE FINGER COULD REACH ON EITHER SIDE STILL REMAINED HARD AND IMPENE TRABLE AND AFTER REPEATED TRIALS WITH FORCEPS OF DIFFERENT KINDS AND OF THE STRONGEST POWERS IT WAS FOUND IMPOSSIBLE FARTHER TO REDUCE THE SIZE OF IT OR TAKE IT AWAY THE PATIENT BORE THE SEVERAL ATTEMPTS AND THE NECESSARILY PROTRACTED OPERATION WITH GREAT FIRMNESS PROBABLY FROM THE PARALIZED STATE OF THE PARTS THE NATURAL ACUTENESS OF SEN SATION WAS BLUNTED HOWEVER AS FROM WEAKNESS AND FATIGUE HE WAS BECOMING MUCH EXHAUSTED AND THE COMPLETE EXTRAC TION APPEARED CLEARLY OUT OF OUR POWER IT WAS JUDGED RIGHT TO RELINQUISH ANY FURTHER ENDEAVOURS NO HAMORRHAGE ENSUED HE BECAME CALM AND COMPOSED AND PASSED A TOLERABLY GOOD NIGHT THE NEXT DAY HE COM PLAINED ONLY OF THE SAME KIND OF SPASMS AND FREQUENT PRESSING DESIRE TO VOID URINE THAT HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO FEEL AND NOT IN ANY VERY GREAT DEGREE MORE ACUTE AS SOME PROOF OF THIS HE WAS FREQUENTLY INQUIRING WHEN I THOUGHT THE WOUND WOULD BE IN A STATE TO ADMIT OF THE EXTRACTION OF THE REMAINDER O6FROM TLZE HUMAN BLADDER THE SECOND NIGHT PASSED NEARLY THE SAME WITHOUT TENSION OF THE BELLY THE URINE FLOWING THROUGH THE WOUND AND SOME BY THE PENIS THE THIRD DAY HE COMPLAINED MUCH OF THE TENDERNESS OF THE ABDOMEN WHICH WAS TENSE AND PAINFUL AND PERITONITIS SEEMNED RAPIDLY TO BE TAKING PLACE WHICH HOWEVER WAS LESSENED AND QUIETED BY BLEEDING AND FOMENTATIONS AND HE AGAIN BECAMNE EASY THIS STATE CONTINUED FOR SEVERAL DAYS BUT HE COMPLAINED MUCH OF THE FREQUENT RETURNS OF HIS FORMER SPASMTS AFTER EACH OF WHICH A SMALL QUANTITY OF URINE WAS EVACUATED HE WAS NOU RISHED WITH BROTHS JELLIES C BUT WOULD TAKE NOTHING SOLID NOT EVEN BREAD IN ANY FORM  AFTER THE FIFTH DAY HE ATE A FEW OYSTERS SOME FISH OR CHICKEN DRANK OCCASIONALLY OF PORTER AND HIS HEALTH AND STRENGTH WERE IMPROVING BUT THOUGH THESE FAVOURABLE SYMPTOMS CONTINUED WITH THE ABDOMEN SOFT AND EASY SO AS TO BEAR EXAMINATION BY THE HAND AND ALL IN FLAMMATORY ACTION WAS SUBSIDED YET THE REPEATED SPASMS CON TINUALLY BROKE HIS REST AND KEPT HIM IN A CONSTANT STATE OF IRRITATION OBLIGING HIM TO VIOLELN EFFORTS IN RESISTING THEM AND TO GET INSTANTLY ON HIS KNEES WITH HIS HEAD LOW ON THE BED TO ENABLE QIM TO EXPEL THE URINE AND ONE SPASM FREQUENTLY SUCCEEDING BEFORE THE FORMER HAD WELL SUBSIDED KEPT HIS WHOLE RAME IN COANTINUAL AGITATION TO THE GREATEST POSSIBLE DEGREE THAT NATURE COU LD BEAR ALL THESE SENSATIONS AND OCCURRENCES WERE VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT HE HAD EXPERIENCED FOR SEVERAL MONTHS BEFORE HE LEFT SCOTLAND AND IT WAS THEN THE OPINION OF MR STEWART A MEDICAL GENTLEMANN WHO ACCOMPANIED SIR WALTER TO ENGLAND THAT HIS COMPLAINTS WERE INCREASING TO SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT WAS SCARCELY POSSIBLE FOR HIM TO EXIST MUCH LONGER IN HIS PRESENT SITUATION OF COURSE SUCH SHOCKS AND DISTURBANCES OF THE WHOLE ANIMAL ECONOMY ACTED WITHSIR JAMES EARLES ACCOUNT OF A CALCULUS INCREASED EFFECT IN PROPORTION AS HE BECAME LESS CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING THEM TOWARD THE EIGHTH DAY FROM THE OPERATION HE WAS VISIBLY GROWING WEAKER HIS PULSE SMALLER AND QUICKER HIS LITTLE INCLINATION FOR FOOD BECAME LESS AND HE WAS WITH DIFFICULTY PREVAILED ON TO TAKE ANY SOME CORDIAL MEDICINES HOWEVER IN SOME DEGREE REVIVED HIM BUT ON THE NINTH DAY HE GREW MORE IMPATIENT FEVERISH AND RESTLESS AND ON THE TWENTYFIRST OF AUGUST TEN DAYS AFTER THE OPERATION HE DE SIRED NOT TO BE TEASED TO TAKE ANY THING MORE WHEN COVERING HIMSELF COMPLETELY WITH THE BEDCLOTHES HE QUIETLY RESIGNED A MOST SINGULARLY MISERABLE EXISTENCE EXAMINATION AFTER DEATH ON OPENING THE ABDOMEN THE BLADDER WAS FOUND MUCH DIS EASED AND THICKENED FIRMLY EMBRACING A STONE OF EXTRAORDI NARY MAGNITUDE AND APPEARING TO BE COMPLETELY FILLED WITH IT ON DIVIDINLG THE BLADDER FROM THE OS PUBIS BACKWARDS TO THE RECTUM THE STONY MASS WAS UNCOVERED WHICH I ATTEMPTED TO TAKE AWAY WITH THE LARGEST FORCEPS BUT IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE IT WAS THEN RAISED BY GETTING THE HAND UNDER IT WITH CONSIDER ABLE DIFFICULTY AS THE COHESION BETWEEN THE BLADDER AND THE STONE WAS VERY STRONG THOUGH THERE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY DISEASED OR DISTINCT ADHESIONS WHEN TAKEN OUT THE FORM OF THE STONE APPEARED TO HAVE BEEN MOULDED BY THE BLADDER THE LOWER PART HAVING BEEN CONFINED BY THE BONY PELVIS TOOK THE IMPRESSION OF THAT CAVITY AND WAS SMALLER THAN THE UPPER PART WHICH HAVING BEEN UNRESTRICTED IN ITS GROWTH EXCEPT BY THE SOFT PARTS WAS LARGER AND PROJECTED SO AS TO LIE ON THE OS PUBIS A LARGE EXCAVATION IHAD BEEN MADE IN THE LOWER PART WHICH 8O8FROM THE HUMAN BLADDER GO9 LAY ON THE NECK OF THE BLADDER BY THE OPERATION THE INTERNAL STRUCTURE WAS THUS EXPOSED IN WHICH APPEARED DISTINCT STONES OR NUCLEI NOW CONSOLIDATED INTO ONE MASS DISPOSED IN LAYERS THE WEIGHT OF THE STONE WAS FORTYFOUR OUNCES OR THREE POUNDS FOUR OUNCES APOTHECARYS WEIGHT THE FORN OF IT ELLIPTICAL THE PERIPHERY ON THE LONGER AXIS SIXTEEN INCHES ON THE SHORTER FOURTEEN THE KIDNEYS WERE ALTERED CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR TEXTURE AND THEIR PELVIS MUCH ENLARGED THE LEFT WAS PRESSED UP HIGHER THAN NATURAL AND ADHERED FIRMLY TO THE SPLEEN THE RIGHT WAS ATTACHED TO THE ASCENDING COLON AND GENERAL ADHESION HAD OBTAINED BETWEEN ALL THE SURROUNDING PARTS THE URETERS WERE MUCH INCREASED IN THEIR DIMENSIONS AND THICKNESS AND WERE CAPABLE OF CONTAINING A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF FLUID THEY WERE IN FACT SUPPLEMENTAL BLADDERS THE REAL BLADDER HAVING BECOME NOTHING MORE THAN A PAINFUL AND DIFFICULT CON DUCTOR OF URINE WHICH TRICKLED DOWN IN FURROWS FORMED BY IT ON THE SUPERIOR SURFACE OF THE STONE THIS CLEARLY EXPLAINED THE CAUSE WHICH OBLIGED THE PATIENT WHEN COMPELLED TO EVA CUATE URINE TO PUT HIMSELF IN THAT POSTURE WHICH MADE THE UPPER PART OF THE BLADDER BECOME THE LOWER BY WHICH MEANS A RELAXATION OR SEPARATION WAS ALLOWED TO TAKE PLACE BETWEEN THE BLADDER AND THE STONE SO THAT THE URETERS HAD AN OPPOR TUNITY OF DISCHARGING THEIR CONTENTS  WHEN THE BODY WAS ERECT THEIR MOUTHS OR VALVULAR OPENINGS MUST OF COURSE HAVE BEEN CLOSED BY THE PRESSURE OF THE ABDOMINAL VISCERA ON THE BLADDER AGAINST THE STONE HIS DIFFICULTY OF VOIDING URINE APPEARS TO HAVE GRADUALLY INCREASED AS THE BLADDER BECAME MORE AND MORE FILLED WITH THE STONY MATTER AND THE EXTREMITY OF HIS DISTRESS DID NOT COME MDCCCIX S S3S O SIR JAME EAR LES S CCOUNT OF A CALCULUS ON TILL THE WHOLE CAVITY WAS NEARLY CHOKED UP FROM THE APPEARANCES ON THE EXAMINATION IT IS MORE THAN PROBABLE THAT THE MOUTHS OF THE URETERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SOON COMPLETELY CLOSED WHEN A TOTAL AND CONSEQUENTLY FATAL SUPPRESSION OF URINE MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE THE DISEASE PROBABLY ORIGIATED WHEN THE PATIENT WAS OBLIGED TO CONTINUE SUCH A LENGTH OF TIME ON HIS BACK IN WHICH POSITION THE SURFACE OF THE WATER ONLY MAY BE SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN AS IT WERE DECANTED AND THE BLADDER SELDOM IF EVER COMPLETELY EMPTIED THUS IN A CONSTITUTION PERHAPS NATURALLY INCLINED TO FORM CONCRETIONS THE EARTHY PARTICLES SUBSIDED AND BY ATTRACTION SOON BEGAN TO LAY THE RUDIMENTS OF A STONE WHICHL WAS NOT FELT ABOVE THE BRIM OF THE PELVIS TILL MANY YEARS AFTER BUT FROM THAT TIME THE GRADUAL INCREASE OF IT WAS PER CEPTIBLE TO THE PATIENT AND HIS MEDICAL FRIENDS FROM THIS CIR CUMSTANCE AS WELL AS THE SHAPE OF IT THE STONE EVIDENTLY APPEARS TO HAVE COMMENCED WITHIN THE PELVIS AND IN THE LOWEST PART OF THE BLADDER THE TEXTURE OF IT APPEARED DIFFERENT FROM THE GENERALITY OF CALCULI AND TO CONTAIN MORE ANIMAL MATTER IN A SHORT TIME IT BECAME HIGHLY PUTRID AND OFFENSIVE AFTER MACERATING A FEW HOURS IN FRESH WATER THE SALINE PARTICLES IN ITS COMPOSITION BEGAN TO SEPARATE LARGE FLAKES SEPARATED FROM ITS SURFACE AND I WAS CONVINCED THAT IF THE MACERATION HAD BEEN CONTI NUED THE WHOLE OF THE OUTER PART WOULD HAVE CRUMBLED AWAY IT WAS THEREFORE SUFFERED TO DRY AND THE PUTRID EFFLUVIA GRA DUALLY WENT OFF AS A PROOF THAT ANIMAL MATTER ABOUNDED THE CALCULUS NOT HAVING BEEN PROTECTED FROM THE FLIES MAGGOTS WERE PRODUCED IN IT AT THE END OF A FORTNIGHT WHICH WERE DESTROYD BY WASHING IT WITH SPIRITSJRIM TIHE HUZAN BLADDER DR POWEL EXAMINED ITS CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND IFORMS ME THAT IT DECIDEDLY CONSISTS OF THE TRIPLE PHOSPHAT OF AMMO NIA AND MAGNESIA WITH PHOPHAT OF LIME FORMING TOGETHER THE FUSIBLE CALCULUS OF DR WOLLASTON PHIL TRANS 179 7 MIXED WITH A CERTAIN PORTION OF ANIMAL MATTER WHICH WAS SE PARATED AND FLOATED UNDER A MEMBRANELIKE FORM ON THE SOLUTION OF THE SALTS IN DILUTED ACIDS THAT THIS COMPOSITIONIS DEMONSTRABLE BY ALL THE USUAL RELATIONS TO ALKALIES AND DILUTED ACIDS AND THE PRECIPITATES FROM SOLUTIONS IN THE LATTER BY AM MONIA AND ALSO BY ITS FUSION INTO ENAMEL UNDER THE BLOWPIPE AND THAT THE GENERAL EXTERNAL CHARACTER OF THE CALCULUS ESTAB LISHES THE SAME FACT BY ITS SEMITRANSPARENT APPEARANCE AND REGULAR PRISMATIC CRYSTALS OF THE TRIPLE SALT DISCOVERABLE BY A MAGNIFIER BETWEEN THE MORE COMPACT LAYERS THE NUCLEI WERE EXAMINED SOLELY WITH THE BLOWPIPE FROM A WISH NOT TO DISTURB SO FINE A SPECIMEN BEYOND WHAT HAD BEEN DONE BY THE OPERATION BY THIS EXAMINATION THEY WERE FOUND LESS FUSIBLE THAN THE GENERAL MASS AND APPEARED TO CONTAIN A LARGER PROPORTION OF PHOSPHAT OF LIME FOR BY ADMIXTURE OF A PORTION OF TRIPLE PHOSPHAT OF MAGNESIA TAKEN FROM ANOTHER PART OF THE SAME CALCULUS THEY WERE RENDERED AS FUSIBLE AS THE REST THIS CALCULUS ACCORDS ENTIRELY WITH THE DESCRIPTION GIVEN BY FOURCROY SYSTEME DE CONNOISANCE CHEMIQUE

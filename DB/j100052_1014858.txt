j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1014858,The League of Nations Effective,i242685,The League of Nations Effective By HAMILTON HOLT Editor of The Independent New York City IN his famous Des Moines speech of October 7 1920 in which he first definitely repudiated the League of Nations Senator Harding said Our opponents are persistently curious to know whether ifor perhaps I might better say whenI am elected I intend to scrap  the League It might be sufficient in reply to suggest the futility of scrapping anything that is already scrapped A committee of thirtyone influential and distinguished Republicans issued a week later an appeal to all friends of the League urging them to vote for Mr Harding on the theory that he would bring the United States into the existing League of Nations better than would Mr Cox They stated that The conditions in Europe make it essen tial that the stabilizing effect of the treaty already made between the European powers shall not be lost by them and that the necessary changes be made by changing the terms of the treaty rather than by beginning entirely anew That course Mr Harding is willing to follow It now turns out that Mr Harding meant exactly what he said on October 7 and that the thirtyone eminent Re publicans have misled the country in saying that he would bring the United States into the existing League modi fied to meet Americas objects for in his first message to Congress delivered on April 12 he said In the existing League of Nations world governing with its super powers this Republic will have no part There can be no misinterpretation and there will be no betrayal of the deliberate expression of the American people in the recent election and settled in our decision for ourselves it is only fair to say to the world in general and to our associates in war in particular that the League Covenant can have no sanction by us If any doubt remains of the attitude of the leaders of the Republican party on the existing League of Nations I make the following quotation from Senator Lodge who erected this tomb stone above the grave when he said in the Senate on April 30 1921 The League brought back by Mr Wilson from Paris as snarled up with the Treaty of Peace of Versailles has been passed upon by the Senate and by the people and that League I venture to say is dead It is dead for the time being anyway It will stay dead I think at least four years and I do not believe that any change of party in this country will ever restore life to that unhappy instrument What then is this League of Nations that Senator Harding said last October is already scrapped and President Harding says today can have no sanc tion by us What is this moribund thing that the distinguished Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee of the United States Senate declares is snarled up and dead I can not hope in this short article to bring in review all the things that have been done by the League of Nations and under its auspices since it began its official existence on January 10 1920 exactly a year and a half ago Things are happening with such cumu lating swiftness that I doubt if anyone outside the Secretariat at Geneva can keep fully uptodate in things accom plished and things projected All I can hope to do is to present a few of 2 1THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the more salient things that have been accomplished by the League or are now on its agenda At the present moment fortynine nations have become members Evi dently they have no fears that the Covenant violates their constitutions or limits their sovereignty or independ ence Indeed at the very first meet ing of the Council Lord Curzon the British delegate took occasion to an swer this purely American criticism by saying It has sometimes been said that the League of Nations implies the establish ment of a SuperState or a SuperSover eignty The very title League of Na tions should be sufficient to dispel this misconception The League does not interfere with nationality It is upon the fact of nationhood that it rests The League is an association of sovereign na tions whose purpose is to reconcile divergent interests and to promote international cooperation in questions which affector may affectthe world at large Of the three principal agencies through which the League functions all are already completely organized and all are effectively at work THE COUNCIL The Council has so far held twelve separate sessions At each one of these questions of world importance have been discussed and so far the members have been able to come to unanimous agreement on every issue It has al ready appointed the various commis sions entrusted to it by the Covenant Perhaps the most important of these is the Permanent Advisory Commis sion on Military Naval and Aerial Affairs which was organized at the San Sebastian session and is now at work This commission is composed of technical military experts The principal duties of this commission are to propose plans for universal disarma ment to advise as to the size of the armaments of the new states who apply for membership in the League and to suggest plans for obviating the evil effects attendant upon the private manufacture of munitions and imple ments of war An eminent commission of juris consults was appointed by the Council to work out the constitution of the Per manent Court of International Justice It is no secret that Elihu Root was the dominating personality of the commis sion and to him more than any other member is due credit for the truly ad mirable plan that was worked out The court has been accepted by the Council and ratified by the Assembly It will be the first international tribunal on earth with original jurisdiction The method of selecting the judges which has baffled diplomacy since the failure of the Second Hague Conference to agree on a plan has been happily solved by having the Council and Assembly select the judges Thus Elihu Root who has done so little to help and so much to hinder the estab lishment of the existing League of Na tions finds that only through the ma chinery of the League can his life dream of a Great World Tribunal be realized The Council has appointed a Pro visional Committee on Communica tions and Transit This Commission will take up all problems connected with international ports waterways and railways and it has been especially charged with making an early report on the abominations that exist through the world and especially in Europe since the war began in connection with through tickets customs and passports The Conference on International Health was called by the Council and was held in London last April and chiefly concerned itself with the measures to be taken against the spread of typhus in Poland This conference proposed 2THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS EFFECTIVE that a permanent health commission should be added to the commissions of the League and as a means of abolish ing typhus in Poland it took measures to establish a chain of seventytwo quarantine stations and two hundred hospitals The Council commissioned the great Norwegian statesman and explorer Dr Nansen to supervise the repatriation of the halfmillion prisoners in Russia illfed almost unclothed ravaged by disease and driven like slaves Dr Nansen reported to the Council that despite almost insuperable obstacles which were being encountered in find ing shipping and raising funds and in carrying out manysided negotiations between allies former neutrals and Soviet authorities there was a fair chance of saving most of the halfmil lion soldiers before they starved to death last winter The Council called an International Financial Congress which completed its labors last summer in Brussels It urged disarmament as a means to busi ness rehabilitation and made important constructive suggestions in regard to international trade finance currency and exchange The Council has already taken cogni zance of three international disputes all of which might otherwise have led to warthose between Sweden and Finland Poland and Lithuania and Persia and Soviet Russia Take the Aland Island case between Sweden and Finland which raises the vital issue of the rights of secession under the League Finland claimed the League had no jurisdiction over the case as the Aland Islands were within her territory and the League can not pass on matters of purely domestic concern Sweden claimed the League had jurisdiction of the dispute as a matter affecting the peace of the world As Great Britain a nation stranger to the dispute brought the matter to the attention of the League we have here an almost exact parallel to what would happen if America should bring before the Council the question of Irelands inde pendence Not long ago the arbitra tion board appointed by the Council decided the case in favor of Finland The case of Armenia was taken up by the Council As the League has no army or navy or treasury of its own it could not take the mandate for that tragic country But it is devising a plan by which some single nation may be authorized to assume the mandate under the collective guarantee of the League The Council in addition to the above selected the commissions who will ad minister the Saar Valley and Danzig it ordered the Secretariat to ask Eng land and Japan to modify their treaty of offense and defense in the Far East so as to make it consistent with the Covenant it called an International Conference of Seamen at Genoa it heard Indias claim to be included in the governing body of the International Labor Office it took under considera tion Frances proposal to establish an International University at Brussels it admitted Switzerland to membership in the League with such reservations as are required by the Swiss constitution and it approved plans for sending a commission of labor leaders and em ployers into Soviet Russia to survey social and economic conditions there THE SECRETARIAT All this and more the Council has been doing since January 1990 The Secretariat has been equally active I visited last summer its temporary quar ters at 117 Picadilly London and there collected enough information to fill a book Suffice it to say that the League appropriated 6000000 Swiss francs to purchase the National Hotel and neigh 3THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY boring property at Geneva for the seat of the League and there the Secreta riat is now ensconced The Secretariat is divided into the following sections Legal Mandates Health Transit Fi nance Information Economics Politi cal and International Bureaus Sir Eric Drummond the secretary has under him two hundred and twentyfive ex perts and assistants all of whom are supposed to put the world above coun try and no one of whom by decree of the Council is allowed to accept deco rations from governments while in office The International Labor Office which was organized before the Coun cil and Secretariat got in running order is the farthest advanced of any of the Permanent Commissions of the League and is now functioning at Geneva under Albert Thomas of France the director general and a governing body of twentyfour representatives of labor and capital from the most important industrial nations It has held two important meetings already one in Washington and the other in Paris The third is convening in Geneva where agricultural questions will pre dominate on the program At the first conference six draft conventions were approved They included provisions for the eghthour day protection of women and children in industry and the establishment of unemployment offices and insurance These labor con ventions are the Magna Charta of labor throughout the world and deserve the attention of all people interested in the progress of those who work for their livelihood THE ASSEMBLY The Assembly was called by Presi dent Wilson It met in Geneva No vember 15 1920 All things consid ered the work it accomplished makes an extraordinary record The official reports are in the shape of a Provisional Verbatim Record of the thirty plenary sessions of the Assembly an official journal giving a complete abstract of the work of the entire Congress the ProcesVerbaux minutes of the six subcommittees of the Assembly and several hundred documents covering every conceivable subject of interest superinterest and noninterest to the Assembly I have gone over all this voluminous material with care and I have no hesi tation in saying that considering that this was the first time nations ever met under a written constitution that the session only lasted five weeks that ac cording to the Covenant the Assembly could not act except by unanimity and then only in an advisory capacity the results accomplished were highly satis factory and indicate that the League of Nations is not going to fail as its ene mies have predicted but is destined to grow in power and prestige until all nations enter its friendly circle and wars shall be no more What then did the Assembly do In the first place forty nations sent delegates These delegates sat togeth er in thirty plenary sessions and held over fifty committee meetings They approved all the work done by the va rious organs of the League in the first ten months of its existence They admitted six new members two of them recent enemies Austria Bulgaria Fin land Luxemburg Costa Rica and Al bania Four other states formerly part of the Russian Empire namely Esthonia Latvia Lithuania and Georgia while not admitted were never theless given immediate representation on the technical organizations of the League as a proof of the Leagues inten tion of admitting them at the earliest possible moment Armenia was not admitted because of the tragic condi tions prevailing in the Near East But 45 THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS EFFECTIVE her unhappy plight was the subject of much stirring debate Finally when for one reason or another practically every nation in the League found itself unable to assume a mandate over Ar menia the Assembly unanimously passed a resolution expressing the hope that the efforts of the President of the United States energetically supported by the governments of Spain and Brazil and by the Council of the League will result in the preservation of the Ar menian race and in securing for Arme nia a stable government exercising authority throughout the whole of the Armenian state as the boundaries thereof may be settled under the treaty of Sevres so that the Assembly may be able to admit her into full membership in the League at its next meeting Belgium was given the honor of hav ing the first president of the Assembly Her distinguished diplomat and states man Paul Hymans was unanimously elected to the office M Motta Presi dent of Switzerland was elected hon orary president Twelve vicepresi dents were nominated the first six by virtue of their presiding over one of the six subcommittees and the remaining six being named at large These twelve vicepresidents are to serve as a steer ing committee of the Assembly until its next meeting Naturally the first thing done was to adopt rules of procedure Not only were many technical questions to be decided but it was necessary to define the jurisdiction of the Assembly and especially to see that it did not inter fere with the rights of the Council Perhaps the most important rule adopt ed was the suggestion of the Scandina vian delegates that the Assembly meet automatically once a year on the first Monday in September Another sig nificant rule was that where the Coun cil and the Assembly have concurrent jurisdiction neither one can interfere if the other has first taken cognizance of the matter Work with the Council The Covenant gives the Assembly the right to appoint the four nonper manent members of the Council but does not specify how this is to be done The matter was discussed from two main viewpoints One group held that no Assembly could bind its successors The other maintained that the spirit of the Covenant implied a fair division of political power and a definite rota tion of office After considerable delib eration it was decided to leave the question for a future meeting and Spain Brazil Belgium and China were elected for one year only The first three nonpermanent members were already on the Council But Chinas substitution for Greece was a great diplomatic triumph for that brilliant young Chinese delegate Dr Koo who now has obtained for his country a posi tion in the League where through the unanimity principle prevailing on the Council it can block any action pro posed especially in the interests of Japan The three Scandinavian kingdoms proposed amendments to the Covenant in respect to the annual meeting of the Assembly the method of selection of the nonpermanent members of the Council the economic blockade and arbitration Canada whose delegates more than once startled the otherwise solemn sessions with some very frank and good American talk actually pro posed to eliminate from the Covenant the nefarious Article X Argentina proposed that all sovereign states should be admitted on application But the League had been in existence less than a year and it was thought better not to change the foundation stones until it was a little more evident how things were working out andTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY especially until the Harding adminis tration had come into office and had time to submit its proposals So although petulant Argentina left in a huff the Council was asked to consti tute a special Amendments Committee to study the whole question and sub mit a detailed report to the next meet ing of the Assembly The Assembly referred several other questions to the Council on which it wished further light or thought the Council had prior or more appropriate jurisdiction It requested the Council to appoint committees a to study and report on the sixtynine treaties that had already been registered with the secretariat with a view to settling some legal questions that had arisen b to determine the moment when the economic blockade should come into operation and especially the exact method of its application in particular cases notably when a state not a member of the League is to be pro ceeded against c to consider means for securing throughout the world greater publicity of the meetings of the Assem bly and the Council and in general the work of the League d to investi gate the work efficiency number salaries and allowances of the secre tariat e to arrive at a more equitable system of allocating the expenses of the League among its members than the apportionment of the Universal Postal Union affords and f to inquire into the deplorable deportation of women and children in Armenia Asia Minor and neighboring countries with a view to stopping that hideous prac tice On this committee there must be one woman Formation of Committees The Assembly appointed several committees of its own Of these the technical committees on health transit and economics and finance were per haps the most important They were made autonomous in internal affairs but under the supervision of the As sembly and the Council in all matters of policy The Office International dHygiene Publique in Paris was designated to form the nucleus of the Leagues Health Organization which was charged with the coordination of the various health agencies in the world the bring ing of them into close coiperation with the International Labor Office the Red Cross etc the hastening of concerted action in case of epidemics and the preparation of international health congresses A medical secre tariat with a competent staff is to be installed at Geneva all under the gen eral direction of an expert committee A General Conference on Freedom of Communications and Transit was to be called at Barcelona Spain This con ference was charged with considering the whole transport problem and partic ularly with framing agreements neces sitated by Article XXIII of the Cove nant and the various conventions in existence in respect to international ports waterways and railways The conference was to act as a permanent advisory committee to the Assembly and Council and keep a watchful eye on all transit questions and arrange for future conferences The Permanent Advisory Economic and Financial Committee which re places the existing provisional com mittee is given the broadest powers It must consider ways and means to carry out immediately the recommen dations agreed upon at the Brussels Conference It must investigate any financial and economic problems sub mitted to it by the Council It must prepare the agenda of the next Inter national Conference and summon it whenever the time seems opportune The Assembly heartily endorsed the 67 THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS EFFECTIVE principles promulgated at Brussels and especially enjoined upon the mem bers of the League the necessily of em ploying for the present all their na tional wealth in strictly productive channels Probably the most important single act of the Assembly was the adoption with but slight modifications of the Permanent Court of International Justice as originally prepared by Elihu Root and his confreres at The Hague and amended by the Council at its Brussels session As Britain France and Japan are evidently not ready yet to grant the court any compulsory jurisdiction the United States Senate took the same view when the Taft arbitration treaties were before them the draft was modified to prevent one nation from being able to hail another into court But this was too reaction ary for most of the lesser powers so a compromise was effected whereby the nations so desiring could declare in advance what subjects they were willing to arbitrate and compulsory arbitration followed between those making the same declaration But the great Courtthe Court that when it comes into existence Elihu Burritt said would constitute the highest Court of Appeals this side of the Bar of Eternal Justiceis now finally ap proved The states subscribe to it as it stands and both members and non members of the League have the right and privilege of seeking its august arbitrament On Disarmament The Assembly felt the cosmic urge for disarmament now prevalent throughout the world But as the Technical Armament Commission ap pointed by the Council at its San Sebastian meeting had hardly had time to organize and as America and Ger many were outside the League and as Russia was in chaos and wars and rumors of wars were rife throughout the four corners of the globe it was evidently time to festina lente The Assembly approached the ques tion of disarmament from the view point that progress must be effected in three successive stages First there must be a general agreement among the members of the League not to increase their present armaments Second there must be a general agreement for proportional and simultaneous reduc tion in armaments or in existing mili tary budgets Third there can then be such complete disarmament as will not jeopardize national security Two concrete steps further were taken A recommendation was adopted by a vote of thirty to seven asking the Coun cil a to submit to the member states the question of the advisability of their not increasing their military budgets for the next two years and b to add to the present Technical Military Commission a temporary committee of political social and economic experts it being recognized that the problem of disarmament is by no means ex clusively perhaps not even chiefly a military one In regard to the private manufacture of munitions and the possibility of the large stocks of war implements accu mulated during the war getting into the less civilized zones of Asia and Africa the Council was asked to initiate an immediate investigation into these dangers and especially to urge upon all governments the immediate approval of the Convention of St Germain for the control of trade in arms and am munition which has not yet been ratified Other Activities No more pitiable condition exists outside of Armenia than in Poland where one of the worst epidemics ofTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY typhus in history has been raging for over two years The Assembly heartily approved the work already accom plished under the auspices of the Coun cil and as showing the spirit animating its members a large sum of money was contributed by the various govern ments to fight the scourge Canada was the banner giver making her donation equal to that of England and France while China came across with 10000 and even exenemy Bul garia contributed her mite What is more President Hymans was em powered to nominate a committee of three delegates to act in cooperation with the Public International Hygiene Office the Red Cross and the League of Red Cross Societies in raising funds for fighting epidemics throughout Cen tral Europe The Secretariat was requested to send a questionnaire to all govern ments asking what measures they have taken to combat the world wide evil of the traffic in women and children The governments signatory to the congresses of 1904 and 1910 are to be immediately urged to put those benef icent conventions into operation An international conference will be held prior to the next meeting of the Assembly to coordinate the replies to the questionnaire and to prepare a program for united action The Netherlands government which was charged by the opium conferences at The Hague in 1912 1913 and 1914 with taking the initiative in the inter national war on opium has transferred her responsibility to the shoulders of the League The Assembly therefore called upon the Secretariat to collect all available data on the production distribution and consumption of opium and appointed a committee of three to sift the information and to report to the Council three months before the next meeting of the Assembly The Assembly adopted a budget of 21000000 gold francs This included 7000000 gold francs for the Labor Office If America had been a member of the League our quota would have been about 220000 which is about onetenth of one per cent of what we spent on military preparation before the war and about twothousandths of one per cent of what we spent on armaments during a single year of the war Finally the Assembly refused to approve of Italys proposal for an im partial international distribution of raw materials it declined Senator La Fontaines plea for the establishment of an international university at Brussels and it was unwilling to record itself as favoring Esperanto as the international language No one I think can have read throughout the debates that took place in the plenary sessions of the Assembly and in the subcommittees without being impressed with the very high order of parliamentary discussion achieved and with the evident desire of all the delegates to do the utmost possible to establish the League on a firm foundation and to work out the confronting international problems in a spirit of helpfulness unselfishness and fair play There was no outpour ing of partisan bunk no descending to personalities and misrepresentation that so often occur in even the best regulated and most otherwise exem plary of national deliberative bodies Japan for instance refused to raise the issue of race equality and Bolivia decided not to press for settlement her longstanding dispute with Chile in order that no untoward event in the early stages of the League might precip itate differences and destroy harmony that was evidently being reached on other matters Comparing the first meeting of the 8THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS EFFECTIVE Assembly with the first meeting of the United States Congress which was scheduled to take place in the City of New York on March 4 1789 one finds the odds in favor of the Assembly At Geneva every delegate was in his seat when the Conference opened while a dozen other nations seeking admission to the League had their representatives present On the date set at New York however but five of the thirteen states appeared Of the twentytwo Senators elected only nine answered the roll call and of the Rep resentatives only thirteen out of the fiftynine were present It was not until April 5 that a quorum of both houses appeared and thus inaugurated the first session of the first Congress of the United States Rhode Island moreover did not join the associa tion until a year and a half after it was a going concern so I suppose there is still hope that the United States may in its own good time and in its own peculiar way join the League COUNCIL AND ASSEMBLY Since the meeting of the Assembly the Council has held two sessions carrying out the work for the most part entrusted to it by the Assembly It has found time however to take note of two matters of special interest to the United States It has made a polite answer to Secretary Hughes note on Yap notifying the United States that the League was not given the power to allocate mandates but only to lay down the rules by which mandates were to be administered It has also taken note of the Panama CostaRica boundary dispute by dis patching an identical telegram to Panama and Costa Rica reminding them of their obligations under the Paris covenant to preserve peace and asking for the facts The United States has officially taken no notice of this and as my proleague friend Mr Theodore Marburg well points out misses a fine opportunity to show our goodwill to the League even though we are not a member of it For as Mr Marburg says We might well have telegraphed to the Council of the League Our treaty guaranteeing the territorial integrity of Panama gives us a special interest in her dispute with CostaRica But we realize that we can not lay down rules of action for other nations and ourselves refuse to conform to them We therefore asso ciate ourselves with you in calling upon both countries to cease fighting Such action would have disclosed a friendly spirit such as the whole world would have appreciated It would have helped instead of slighting the League of fortynine sister nations And it would have disclaimed in the eyes of LatinAmerica intention to use highhanded methods in intervening in their affairs And now the Brazilian Ambassador the acting President of the Council of the League of Nations has just sum moned the members of the League to send delegates to the second session of the Assembly to be opened at Geneva on Monday September 5 A most interesting and important program is announced The provisional agenda includes twentyfive items the prin cipal ones dealing with armament reduction communication and transit the opium traffic the traffic in women and children the typhus campaign international health and international coordination of intellectual work It is also proposed to select the judges for the international court if a majority of the nations have by that time ratified the court protocol AMERICA AND THE LEAGUE This then is the League of Nations that the American people are told is a 9THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY failure This is the Association that is already scrapped This is the super state that would violate our constitu tion and destroy our liberties In conclusion may I quote from a letter just received from a high official of the League of Nations which was written to me from Geneva on April 27 The situation here is most serious The continued attacks from home are having a disastrous effect not only upon this League of Nations but on the whole theory of in ternational coiperation and conference People who entered the League on the theory that it was to be a universal League and that America was willing to take her partand by that I decidedly do not mean by military or financial contribu tionsfeel absolutely nonplussed by the reports that come from home Of course I have no need to tell you with what surprise they have read the state ments that the League is a superstate and the executor of the Peace Treaty To one who has been right in the midst of the thing the impotence of the League except in a moral way makes any charge of its being a superstate utterly wrong where as as regards the Peace Treaties it has religiously and many people think wrong fully kept itself as far aloof from them as possible except where it has been called in not so much to enforce conditions as to ameliorate them However the disastrous thing at the present moment is that this continued dis trust and attack from America is giving the enemies of the League on this side perfectly invaluable ammunition They are making every use of it to destroy not so much the League itself as the spirit and purpose be hind the League in other words to get back to the old selfish nationalistic diplo macy which bore such rich fruits in the years from 1914 to 1918 I honestly feel that if the situation continues much longer if America fails to enunciate some real princi ples of coiperation to which she herself is willing to accede we may come dangerously close to the position of having destroyed the one really great ideal that was born in the war It is a big responsibility that is placed upon America today The world is looking to her for some really constructive sugges tions and if she fails to produce them I have every fear that we shall fall into an era of cynicism and selfishness I am utterly convinced that there is not one man in a thousand in the United States today who realizes the repercussions of Americas attitude both in crippling the friends of those policies which we ourselves have always cherished and in aiding the enemies who support that old order which we have always fought However despite all these discouragements and despite the widening circle of enemies the League is going ahead as courageouly as possible May I add that it is the duty of all true friends of the League to give Mr Harding every opportunity to make good with his new association of na tions If it turns out that the Harding Association is substantially the Wilson League only under another name we can have no lasting quarrel with the President and the Republican domi nant faction in the Senate even though it is pretty picayune business to say the least for grown men to keep the world on the brink of revolution famine and pestilence in order to save the faces of party politicians who can not other wise get out of the holes they have dug for themselves If Mr Harding however is unwill ing or unable to give us an Association with teeth in it the country must be organized to capture the Senate and the House for the existing League two years from now and the Presidency in 1925 Let our Republican leaders make no mistake The League issue will not be settled until it is settled right 10

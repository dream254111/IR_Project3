part in many forms of disease we are somewhat in the habit of looking upon such organisms in general as our enemies forgetting many useful purposes which they serve One of the most important processes taking place on the surface of the globe is the destruction of such organic masses as have been the seat of life but which have suffered death We have only to think for a moment what the re sult of a stopping of this destructive process would be in order to gain a vivid impression in regard to its importance The living thing can resist the destructive forces When life ceases the resistingpower is gone and how ever complex the materials may be of which the organism is made up they are quickly con verted into simple and stable substances The chief products of the changes are carbon di oxide water and ammonia all of which are of high importance as from them again under the influence of life are elaborated the com plex materials Now we know that in the breakingdown of organic matter after death microscopic organisms play a principal r6le They are the efficient scavengers of the earth They effect the transfer of the oxygen of the air to the substances to be destroyed and thus convert useless organic matter into that which is useful We thus see that while there are microbes which cause disease there are others constantly at work keeping the conditions favorable to life Recently the suggestion has been made and by no less an authority than Pasteur that the changes which are involved in the lifepro cess of both plants and animals are probably intimately associated with the activity of what may be called lifemicrobes Pasteur read before the Academy of sciences a paper by Duclaux in which some experiments upon the growth of plants in sterilized soils are de scribed Duclauxs paper begins thus The destruction of the organic matter of the soil by microbes and the production of a new vege VOL V No 113 tation on the soil are two phenomena which always accompany one another Is there any necessary connection between them Through the labors of Pasteur we know that microscopic beings can only live at the expense of complex materials elaborated by the plant with the aid of chlorophyl Can the plant develop in the absence of microscopic beings  in other words can it without their aid utilize the organic matter left by the plant which preceded it on the soil With the object of attempting to answer this question Duclaux experimented upon peas and beans These were freed from germs sown in a soil which was free from germs and supplied with organic matter of a kind which one would naturally expect to be easily assimilated The result was that after one or two months the organic matter was found to be unclhanged and the plants did not thrive any better than when placed in distilled water Pasteur in commenting on these experi ments takes occasion to suggest to Duclaux an experiment on the role which microbes play in animal life The experiment is this A hens egg from the surface of which all germs have been removed is to be hatched in a ster ilized space fed with sterilized food and sup plied with sterilized air Pasteur believes that the result will be that the chick will not live and in general that life is impossible without the cooperation of microbes We must bear in mind that this is merely a suggestion and that it rests at present upon no experimental evidence Experiments of the kind suggested will involve great labor and the greatest accuracy It cannot be de nied that whether the results should prove favorable or unfavorable to the view of Pasteur they would be of the highest interest to the chemist and biologist THE CLIMATE OF THE EGYPTIAN SUDAN Ix so vast a region of country as the Egyp tian Sudan extending as it does over about sixteen or eighteen degrees of latitude and as many of longitude with differences of altiAPRIL 3 1885 SCIE tude of more than six thousand feet on single parallels it is evident that there must be great diversity of climate a full discussion of which would occupy too much space for a reasonable article But that portion of the Egyptian Sudan which at this time attracts the attention of the world by reason of the presence there of European troops and the apparently intended operations of those troops can be here concisely considered British troops now occupy two positions in the Egyptian Sudan viz the province of Dongola on the Nile and the city and port of Suakin on the coast of the Red Sea Italian troops occupy the port and vicinity of Massowah on the RedSea coast and the Bay of Assab and its vicinity on the same coast near the strait of BabelMandeb Whatever may be the object of the Italian government in thus occupying positions on the RedSea coast the object of the present British occupation is declared to be war against El Mahdi and it will be necessary to consider the climate of the territories occupied by his forces El Mahdi now occupies and rules over the following the province of Khartum the prov ince of Darfur t1 t lrovince of Kordofan the province of Senaar the province of Berber the district of Gallabat tlhe province of Taka excepting the capital Kassala and the great desert region between the Nile near Berber and the RedSea coast near Suakin and Agig Thus we have to consider the climate in the provinces and districts above nanmed and first the province of Dongola now occupied by the expeditionary corps under Gen Lord Wolse ley of probably about nine thousand British troops This is one of the rich and productive prov inces of the Egyptian Sudan extending from near Wady Halfa on the north to the borders of the province of Berber along the course of the Nile The correspondence fiomn Lord Wolseleys corps has during the past few months made almost everye hamlet and village throughout its length known to all parts of the world where newspapers are read The cli mate of the region now ocelupied by the British force is not only good but very agreeable during four montlhs of thel year  November December January and February  though February sometimes gives specimen days of the Khamseen wind l whiel are very trying even to natives of the country During the months of March April  May all the first half of June however the climte though not very unhealthy is exceeding trnino to all excepting  In NCE 269 natives of the country The ordinary tem perature is very high during the day the ther mometer in the shade often indicating from 950 to 110 F while during the night the temperature falls to 65 or 70 This great difference makes it necessary to take great care to preserve health and with the best of care intermittent fevers are exceedingly prevalent These if neglected are liable to take typhoid forms During these months the duststorms coming from the southward are of most dis tressing fiequency and violence While these storms are hard to endure and cause great suffering I believe they to a certain extent destroy fevergerms and prevent the climate from being so fatal to Europeans as it would otherwise be From June to September the southerly and southwesterly winds come charged with moisture though rarely yielding rain anld while relieved from the duststorms the European is more subject to fever influences Such is the climate in which the British troops are apparently to wait during the next five months before advancing against their hu man enemy Should they wait there under the best possible care and with the best pos sible medical surveillance the commander will be fortunate should the  unseen enemy not reduce his force by more than ten per cent before October next while another ten per cent would be so debilitated by repeated feverattacks as to require a month of cool weather to restore their strength and make them fit for a vigorous campaign The climate of Suakin can hardly be con sidered unhealthy but for the excessive heat which reigns there except during the three months of December January and February There the desert comes down to the very sea Ieach and the air of the desert though burn ing hot is not unwholesome But the heat in that region where sometimes during two or three successive years rain does not fall while the tropical sunbeams constantly bathe the rocks and sands is of an intensity not to be conceived by those who have never experienced the like and exposure to it by Europeans without extraordinary precautions is certain to produce sunstroke and congestions The thermometer in April in the shade will often indicate a temperature of 100 to 1050 F  but even this does not indicate the effect upon a footsoldier who marching in the sun receives the direct rays and in addition suffers from the heat radiated and reflected from the light colored soil It is however quite lifferent witll the nmoanted soldier whether on horse back or on camelback as if well covered heAPRIL 3 1885 SCI suffers less from the direct rays of the sun and not at all from the reflected and radiated heat As the entire route from Suakin to Berber is subject to heats filly equal to those of the vicinity of Suakin it may be safely asserted that it is impracticable for European foot soldiers to make the march between those two points during the spring and summer months except by using the night and early morning exclusively for marching The climate of the province of Berber is very similar to that of Dongola but owing to the effects of the waters of the river Atbara in some parts of this province fevers are more prevalent during the summer months and of a worse type than in Dongola In the province of Taka and the district of Gallabat the climate from June to October is deadly for Europeans During that season the rains are there copious and mingling with the floods of water coming down from the mountains of Abyssinia cause the rich soil to become like a saturated sponge while the rank vegetation and the exhalations from the soil render the air poisonous From many districts the natives abandon the country in May taking with them their families their flocks and their herds to save themselves and their families from fever and their flocks and herds from the ravages of the stinging insects which during the season of rains infest the country These people go north to the deserts and remain until the latter part of October when they return to find their own country delightful in climate and glorious in vegetation These conditions remain through the winter and the air is healthful until April The climate of Khartum is hot damp and exceedingly unhealthy from April until Octo ber The winter climate is not disagreeable but even in winter the place can hardly be considered healthy owing to the peculiar loca tion of the town between the Blue and White Niles and to lack of sanitary rule in the con struction of the streets and houses During the past twenty years more care has been taken in the construction of dwellings and the con ditions are now more favorable than they for merly were The province of Kordofan is visited by less rain than that of Khartum or of Taka During the winter from the last of October until the 1st of March the climate is very agreeable and quite healthy The prevailing winds are from the north The temperature is not high ranging in the middle of the day from 80 to 88 F The air is bracing and invigorating while the nights are cool and pleasant N NCE 271 March April and May are there the hottest and most disagreeable season though not un healthy In June the season of rains com mences and it lasts until the latter part of September or early October The winds are then from the south and southwest The rains come in showers sometimes daily but oftener once in three or four days The air is debilitat ing and fevers intermittent in form strike all excepting the natives No matter what care may be taken to guard troops from the effects of climate the death rate among soldiers is always great during this wet season In an expedition which I sent into that province well organized well and very carefully commanded well supplied with good medical attendance and good hospital supplies six per cent of the soldiers died during four months of the season of rains while during the remainder of the year there were very few deaths The climate of Darfur closely resembles that of Kordofan The rains come at the same time of year and the sanitary effects of the different seasons are nearly the same yet the fevers according to the reports of the medical officers seem to be more often severe in type in Darfur than in Kordofan C P STONE THE CAROLINE ISLAND ECLIPSE EX PEDITION THE protracted duration of totality of the eclipse of May 1883 early attracted the atten tion of astronomers but an examination of its shadowtrack on the earth showed the unfortu nate fact that it would begin in the Pacific just east of Australia and completely traverse the ocean finally leaving the earth before the South American continent was reached Only one eclipse had ever been observed with a greater duration of totality and the possibility that an observingstation might be available in the small islands of the South Pacific determined Mr Charles Ht Rockwell of Tarrytown NY to endeavor to organize an observing expedi tion from the United States Through his representations the National academy of sci ences was brought to consider the matter and it was expected that Professor Young of Princeton would have the entire charge of the expedition Unforeseen circumstances pre vented this and the party was finally organ ized with Professor Holden as chief and sci Report of the eclipse expedition to Caroline Island lay 1883 In vol ii of the Memoirs of the national academy of sci ences Washington 1884 146

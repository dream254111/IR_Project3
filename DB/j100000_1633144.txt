Advancement of Science was held in Payerweather Hall of Columbia Univer sity in New York City on December 27 28 and 29 1906 The annual meeting of the American Physical Society occurred at the same time and place each society nomi nally held a separate meeting for the trans action of business but all of the sessions for the reading of papers were joint ses sions The presiding officers were

retiring vicepresi dent Professor Henry Crew of North western University gave a most interest ing and important address on Fact and Theory in Spectroscopy this address was printed in full in SCIENCE for January 4 1907 Probably the sessions of Section B have never before been attended by so large a number of representative physicists at some of the meetings more than one hun dred and fifty persons were present The papers were many nearly fifty in number and were upon the whole of a very high order of merit The meeting was uni versally pronounced a most successful one There was no distinction between the programs of the Physical Society and of Section B the abstracts and titles of the papers of both societies are given below Effect of a Magnetic Field upon the Ioniza tion in a Closed Vessel W W STRONG Johns Hopkins University According to present views atoms con tain charged particles which are in rota tion In magnetic substances such as iron or oxygen more of these charged par ticles rotate in one direction than in an other and these orbits of rotation lie in the same or in parallel planes In a mag netic field atoms would turn so that their planes would be perpendicular to the field The effect of the field would then be to decrease the velocity of these charged par ticles but not to change their radius of rotation This would make the atom more stable One could expect that the natural ionization in a closed vessel would be de creased by the application of a strong magnetic field This was the effect looked for The electroscope consisted of a sheetiron box of some three litres volume containing air at atmospheric pressure The charged electrode consisted of a wire bent into the are of a circle at one end The gold leaf was attached to a rod at a point slightly different from the center of the electrode arc The length of the gold leaf being slightly less than the radius of this arc at different positions its end would be at dif ferent distances from the charged elec trode By this means the gold leaf could be made very sensitive to changes of volt age of the charged electrode The gold leaf was earthed By using a large electromagnet the rate of leak was found to be changed as much as thirty parts in a hundred at times although this change was not found to be constant The greatest effect was found when the field was turned on for the first time An example of the readings are as follows they being made consecutively Leak in Scale Divi Rate of Leak sions of Micrometer in Scale Divisions Time Microscope per Second Field on 663 secs 737 00111 Field off 613 secs 876 00143 Field on 515 secs 540 00105 Field off 520 secs 835 00161 The writer can not attribute this change as due to any other effect than that of a magnetic field on the natural ionization It may be possible however that there is some other explanation Projections of the Globe Approprate for Laboratory Methods of Studying the General Circulation of the Atmosphere CLEVELAND

resultant temperature evap oration and clouds In the analytical treatment of this problem beginning with dAlembert Ferrel and Erman as well as in the more elegant works of Helmholtz Oberbeck and Margules it has always been considered necessary to simplify the prob lem by assuming a uniform surface and uniform coefficient of resistance for the whole globe as also a uniform condition of dry air In this shape the problem is already very complicated and it is likely that the profound meteorological problem of the deduction of the actual winds from the laws of mechanics will for a long time be too difficult for pure analysis but on many occasions I have stated my belief that a solution may be arrived at in an experimental way We may represent any portion of the globe with its atmosphere by a horizontal plane surface covered with some heavy gas or liquid such as a thin layer of carbonic acid gas or alcohol or water which is to be set in steady rotation and may be warmed from below in such a way as to approximately imitate the actual isotherms of the lower atmosphere Special areas of high and low temperature can easily be imitated by electrical resistance coils These rotating areas are to be covered by plates of glass rotating with them Various theorems relative to the simi larity of such a model to the atmosphere of the earth were first published by Helmholtz in 1873 On a Theorem Relative to Move ments that are Geometrically Similar in Fluid Bodies and these ideas were further applied by him in memoirs on atmospheric motions in 1888 and 1889 and further de velopments have lately been given by Lord Rayleigh But in applying these ideas to our two polar projections we stumble upon a great difficulty namely that the maps are not true representations of the spherical surface of the earth In the present case we should like to pre serve the equality of surface areas and to preserve equality of distances since we have to compare velocities and above all we should like to preserve the equality of the moments of inertia That which best satisfies all desiderata seems to be Airys projection by balance of errors published by him in 1861 The combination of Airys development with Helmholtzs method of mechanical similarity should enable us to interpret our laboratory ex periments I consider it extremely desirable that these experiments should be made on a large scale with due regard to all numer ical statistical and mechanical details in some laboratory where the study of meteor ology is prosecuted as a branch of mathe matical physics Some New and Useful Data in Reference to the Moist ure of the Air HENRY EMERSON WETHERILL Philadelphia This paper gave an outline of researches upon the relative humidity of the air as determined with a new cobalt chloride scale and test paper and referred to the use of a special instrument for measuring the moisture of the body in different diseases References were made to new psychrom eters for correcting hygroscopes and to studies of the measurement of the perspira tion in malarial and other fevers as carried out in the Philippines Panama and elsewhere and also to a cobalt hygroscope depending upon the change of weight of the test papers with humidity The weigh ings of this change suggested the produc tion of an instrument that might be called the hygrobaro and one that would be of service to the weather bureau524 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 640 The Cimpensated Twocircuit Electro dynamometer for Alternating Current Measurements of Precision EDWARD B ROSA Bureau of Standards If an electric current pass in series through a shunt S and the fixed coil F of an electrodynamometer and a small de rived current taken from the potential points ab of the shunt flow in series through the resistance B and the moving coil a deflection will occur proportional to the square of the current and inversely as the resistance B The current may be either direct or alternating Hence if a known direct current measured by means of a potentiometer standard cell and standard resistance be used first to get the constant of the dynamometer the value of an alternating current can then be ob tained It is shown in the paper mathe matically that any selfinductance in the shunt S or the fixed coil F does not pro duce an error in the alternating current measurement but that the selfinductance of the moving coil and any Foucault cur rents in the fixed coil or in any neighbor ing conductor or metallic parts do cause an error It is shown how to detect such an error and to compensate for it so that the deflected readings of the instrument are the same as though these sources of error were absent The mathematical theory is verified by experiment and alter nating currents up to 500 amperes are thus measured with precision The compensa tion holds good at different frequencies and the error of a Kelvin balance due to frequency is measuqred The Power Factor and Temperature Coef ficient of Mica Condensers E B ROSA and F W GROVER Bureau of Standards Absorption and leakage in a condenser are a cause of expenditure of energy when the condenser is placed on an alternating current cireuit This energy is of course smaller for good condensers than for poor ones and for very good condensers is ex tremely small so small that the heat result ing is inappreciable unless the voltage is higher than can safely be applied to the condenser In the comparison of con densers by means of an alternating cur rent bridge it is shown in the paper how the phase angle of the currents through the two condensers can be compared the differ ence indicating which is the better con denser In an air condenser the current is 900 in phase ahead of the electromotive force acting on the condenser and if a mica condenser is compared with an air condenser and shows a difference in phase of 10 the angle for the mica condenser is 8950 The power factor is then cos 89050  0029 If the power factors of standard mica condensers are determined other condensers may be compared with them and their differences  or  being directly measured giving the power factors of the condensers under test This is the best single test of the quality of a con denser and capacities measured in this way are not subject to the error due to the leakage to which directcurrent measure ments are subject The temperature coefficient of a mica condenser will be affected by the paraffine in which it is embedded Some grades of paraffine melt at a relatively low tempera ture and soften and expand rapidly at still lower temperatures The temperature co efficient of the condenser will be small and nearly constant up to a certain temper ature and then rather suddenly increase greatly The temperature at which this sudden increase occurs is sometimes low enough to occur in summer weather without any additional heating A good mica con denser should be embedded in highgrade paraffine so that its temperature coef ficient may remain small through all ordi nary ranges of laboratory temperaturesAPRIL 5 1907 SCIENCE 525 There is a great differenee among con densers as to power factor and temperature coefficient and a condenser should never be purchased without a knowledge of these constants as well as a knowledge of its capacity The Diffraction of Electric Waves of Short Wavelength A D COLE Ohio State University Peculiarities observed in a quantitative study of the reflection of electric waves seemed to be due to diffraction and led to this study These peculiarities were 1 A sudden increase in the amount of energy passing through a slit of increasing width when it becomes more than a quarter wave wide 2 the amount of energy reflected from a narrow mirror was found to be greater than that passing through a slit of the same width provided each is but a small fraction of a wavelength wide 3 irregularities noticed when screens were in troduced to cut off direct radiation The earlier investigations of Trouton Zehnder and Righi were carried out with apparatus which did not give quantitative results A modified form of Klemencic thermoreceiver made it possible to study the distribution of refracted energy quan titatively A Righi exciter actuated by an induction coil and Wehnelt interrupter was used for generating the waves The lateral distribution was studied and the result exhibited by curves for the fol lowing cases 1 A slit about three fourths of a wavelength wide showed a broad spreading of energy with a central bright band having a dark band and weaker bright band at each side Their locations agreed with the optical formula Xa sin 9 2 A wider slit showed interference bands nearer together 3 Case of energy dis tribution behind a thin metallic edge placed on the axis of a plane wave front 4 Similar with the edge displaced laterally Troutons discovery that the system of nodes and loops formed by reflection at perpendicular incidence from a small plane mirror is shifted outward if the mirror is made with dimensions of a wavelength or less was verified and the amount of the shifting measured for several cases The study of diffraetion is being con tinued Final Report on Etherdrift Experiments EDWARD W MORLEY and DAYTON 0 MLLER At the Philadelphia meeting an account was given of experiments to detect ether drift These observations gave no indica tions of a drift of the ether It has been suggested that the negative results are due to the influence of the heavy stone walls of the building within which the apparatus was mounted The interferometer has therefore been mounted on high ground near Cleveland and covered in such a man ner that there is nothing but glass in the direction of the expected drift It was much more difficult to make observations in this location than in the building satis factory observations could only be made on a cloudy evening following a cloudy day when the temperature changed very slowly The temperature effects could never be en tirely eliminated The conclusion from many observations is that there was no in dication of a drift of the ether through the interferometer The expected drift would produce a displacement of the interference fringes of 153 wavelengths the above result is probably certain to one eightieth part of the whole The Optical Analogue of Certain Electrical Experiments WILLIAM B CARTMEL Harvard University The recent experiments of Messrs Blake and Fountain show that the amount of electric radiation transmitted by sheets of glass may be increased by covering the526 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 640 glass with regularly spaced strips of tin foil and this led the present writer to investigate the possibility of making a thin film of transparent substance more trans parent by covering it with a much thinner film of metal A film of dye was deposited upon one half of a plate of glass and silver was de posited on half the glass but in a direction at right angles to the dye film One could thus compare silvered dye with silvered glass The film of silver was so thin that it was impossible to see any difference be tween the part of the glass that was silvered and the part that was not but where the glass was covered with both silver and dye less light was transmitted than when the glass was covered with dye alone Similar effects were obtained with combined films of silver and selenium The explanation is that the phase change at the top surface of the silvered dye film is different from that at the top surface of the bare dye film The rays reflected from the back surface of the dye will therefore interfere in a different way with the ray reflected from the top surface in the two cases and for certain thicknesses of the dye film the intensity of the light reflected from the film will be diminished by silver ing and there will be a correspondingly increased transmission A Preliminary Communication concerning a NTew Fundamental Principle of the Kinetic Theory of Gases LUIGI DAURIA Philadelphia In this paper the author proves that the square of the speed of an elastic sphere forced to oscillate between two elastic plates perpendicular to the direction of its motion while one of the plates approaches the other with speed which is very small compared with that of the sphere varies inversely with the length of its free path The author observes that in a medium com posed of numerous elastic spheres moving in all directions in a bounded space each sphere can be considered as if moving with the mean square speed in a path equal to the mean free path of all the spheres and therefore in accordance with his new theorem in such a medium the mean square of the speed would vary inversely with the mean free path Combining this result with the expres sion for the mean free path which accord ing to Clausius varies inversely with the density of the medium and the square of the diameter of one of the spheres and observing that the pressure of the medium upon unit area varies with its density and the mean square of the speed of the spheres the author arrives at the equation pv2 constant independent of thermo dynamic considerations in which p is the pressure per unit area and v the volume of unit quantity of the medium Thus in a medium composed of elastic spheres in mo tion in a bounded space the pressure per unit area of the bounding surface would vary inversely with the square of the volume If the above medium represents a gas we must have also pvY  constant in which y is the ratio of the specific heats and therefore y  2 According to Clau sius and Maxwell for such a gas the ratio of the specific heats would be 53 and this is too small to account for the ratio of the specific heats of mercury vapor found by Kundt and Warburg which ranges from 1631 to 1695 since the theory requires that this ratio should be considerably less than the theoretical value The result y  2 leads to the new funda mental equation pv  E in which E repre sents the energy of agitation of the gas and the author shows that this equation accords with the principle of the conserva tion of energy and that therefore the equation pv  23E which results fromAPRIL 5 19071 SCIENCE 527 the investigations of Clausius and Max well can not be correct On the Variation of the Heat of Mixture with Concentration and Temperature B M CLARPK When two liquids are mixed there is in general either an absorption or a genera tion of heat the amount of heat depending upon the relation of the liquids present and upon the temperature at which mix ture occurs The variation of the heat of mixture with temperaturefor any one definite concen trationbears theoretically a simple rela tion to the specific heats of the components of the mixture and the specific heat of the resultant mixture and the present experi ments were begun with a view to determin ing experimentally the numerical value of this relation in the case of some of the simpler solutions Observations were made on the following liquids GlycerinWater GlycerinEthylalcohol GlycerinMethylalcohol PhenolWater Isobutylic AlcoholWater AnilinXylol AnilinToluol The values obtained for the heat of solu tion at various temperatures show that for the liquids tested the thermodynamic rela tion aQat K XK holds within the limits of experimental error The value d Qlt known as the temperature coefficient of the heat of mix tures varies in some mixtures with the temperature Anilin xylol anilintoluol gave evidence of a temperature coefficient equal to zero i e aQat o Numerical values and curves will be given in a paper to appear shortly A Color Mixer ALBERT B PORTER Chicago The simplest means of mixing and matching colors is undoubtedly Maxwells colortop It is however defective in that one can not continuously vary the positions of the slotted discs while seeking a color match but must usually stop the top many times readjust the discs and again set up the rotation before a satisfactory match is secured In the present instrument the slotted discs remain stationary while their image is rapidly rotated This is effected by viewing the discs through a rightangled prism which rotated with its hypothenuse parallel to the axis of rotation and to the line of sight As the slotted discs remain stationary their angular exposure can be easily and continuously varied until the best possible colormatch is secured On the Nature of Optical Images ALBERT B PORTER Chicago A consideration of the method by which light is propagated is sufficient to show that an ordinary optical image is merely a particular case of an interference pattern This may be easily shown experimentally by using as an object a coarse blackline grating illuminated by a parallel beam of monochromatic light passing through the grating and then through a convex lens On the far side of the lens a system of sharply defined interference fringes is formed which can be seen with an eyepiece or intercepted on a screen at any point over a considerable range along the axis Somewhere in this system of fringes is the geometrical image of the grating but it is visually quite indistinguishable from other sections of the fringe system If the angle of incidence of the light falling on the grating is changed the whole fringe sys tem shifts to one side or the other except in the focal plane where it remains sta528 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 640 tionary This shows that the focal plane of the lens is merely the plane in which the interference fringes formed by light of all incidences coincide and that the socalled geometrical image is really a superposition of coincident interference patterns while the usual absence of a sharp image outside the focal plane is due to the more or less uniform illumination caused by the over lapping of fringe systems formed by light coming from various points in the source When the grating is illuminated by a parallel beam of white light the effects are similar except that outside the focal plane the interference fringes are colored This shows that the focal plane is also the plane of achromatic interference i e the plane in which the fringes due to light of various wavelengths coincide On the Conductivity of the Air caused by Certain Compounds during Tempera tureChange FANNY CooK GATES Investigations on the conductivity of the air caused by the presence of the sulphate of quinine under certain conditions indi cate that it accompanies hydration and dehydration although phosphorescent ef fects to which it may be directly due ap pear at the sane time The phenomenon is most easily observed during the cooling of the quinine from something over 1000 C to room temperature Heretofore the only other substance known to produce a similar effect is cin chonine which like quinine hydrates and phosphoresces upon cooling Both sub stances are so complex in structure that the exact chemical changes to which they are subject are studied with difficulty During the investigations described in the present paper a large number of sub stances were heated to about 1500 C and the conductivity of the surrounding gas was tested while they cooled Of all the substances tested none was found to give so large an effect as that which results from the sulphate of quinine but a very definite and marked conductivity was found to accompany the cooling of anthra cene and to a less degree that of grape sugar and aesculin The Transmission of Rontgen Rays through Metallic Sheets J M ADAMS For some years after Rontgen s dis covery of the Xrays it was a matter of doubt whether the absorption of the rays in metallic sheets was accompanied by the development of heat To investigate this question by means of an instrument differ ent from those already used for this pur pose a radiomicrometer was constructed The metals forming the thermal couple were constantan and copper At one of the junctions was placed a small disk of thin platinum to receive the rays the other junction being shielded from them The sensitiveness of this radiomicrometer was such that a radiation of 56 X 108 gm cal per see per sq em of its sensitive surface produced a deflection of one scale division Evidence of heat developed in the plati num by the absorption of Rontgen rays in it was readily obtained The necessity of making correction for the incomplete ab sorption of the rays in the platinum of the instrument together with the wellknown fact that the character of Rontgen rays is changed by passage through substances made it seem desirable to investigate the phenomena of the transmission of the rays through metallic sheets more fully than has been done heretofore The general law of the absorption of the rays in a metal viz that each successive equal increment of thickness is less effect ive as an absorbing medium thian the one preceding it was confirmed by experiments with the radiomicrometer The dependence of the absorbing power of a given metallic sheet upon the intensityAPRIL 5 1907 SCIENCE 529 of the rays incident upon it was examined for sheets of silver platinum copper tin and aluminium and in every case it was found that the effectiveness of a sheet as an absorbing medium is independent of the intensity of the incident rays It was found that the effect of the sur faces of metallic sheets upon transmission is small in the case of copper and of alumi nium To show this a laminated plate of the metal in question was prepared equal in total thickness to another solid plate of the metal These two plates were inter posed in turn in the path of the rays and produced equal reductions of the deflection of the radiomicrometer The transmission of a beam of Rontgen rays through a metallic sheet has generally been supposed to render the beam more penetrating toward a second sheet of the same or of any other metal than the origi nal beam was Evidence of transformation of one sort of ray into another in transmission through a metallic sheet was sought with a negative result The Mutual Inductance of a Circle and a Coaxial Helix The Lorenz Experiment and the AyrtonJones Absolute Electro dynamometer E B ROSA The constant of the Lorenz apparatus for the absolute measurement of resistance and of the AyrtonJones electrodynamometer for the absolute measurement of current require the calculation of the mutual in ductance of a circle and a coaxial helix the circle in the first case being the edge of the rotating dise and in the second case one end of the suspended coil the helix being the fixed coil carrying the primary current Jones obtained an expression for the mutual inductance in question which is a very tedious and difficult one to use in numerical calculations Lorenz s expres sion is an algebraic series less difficult but also less accurate than Joness Using an expansionl in zonal harmonies I have ob tained an impression in the form of an algebraic series similar to Lorenz s but more accurate which is far more conve nient to use than Joness and agreeing with the latter to less than one part in a million in a particular numerical test thus being amply accurate for the most refined experi mental work This expression is obtained on the assumption that the current is dis tributed over the solenoid in a uniform current sheet whereas Joness expression assumed the current flowing in a helix Their agreeinent is a confirmation of the theorem that a spiral distribution of cur rent is equivalent to a current sheet Mutual Inductances for Laboratory Use E B ROSA The most accurate as well as the mnost convenient method of calibrating a ballistia galvanometer is by means of a mutual in ductance through the primary of which a measured current flows Some labora tories use a standard solenoid with a secondary wound within or without cal culating the mutual inductance of the pri mary and secondary coils from their di mensions Such a solenoid made large enough and carefully enough to give the mutual inductance with fair precision is both bulky and expensive and not very portable Being of considerable length its magnetic field often extends to a consider able distance and may disturb other work On the other hand suitable primary and secondary coils may be wound on a thor oughly seasoned wood spool or a marble spool only 10 to 12 cm in diameter and afford when calibrated an accurate and convenient mutual inductance for the cali bration of galvanometers that is cheap portable and reliable Such inductances are so inexpensive and occupyso little space that one can be left with its secondary in530 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 640 circuit with the galvanometer ready to be used for calibrating the latter at any time They can be made in the laboratory at trifling cost and can be sent by mail or express to the Bureau of Standards and calibrated at very slight expense Speci fications for such coils will shortly be pub lished by the bureau The Mutual Inductance of Two Coaxial Coils E B ROSA Absolute measurements of resistance have been made by Rowland Glazebrook and others using two coaxial coils the mutual inductance of which was computed from their dimensions By the methods employed by Kohlrausch and Rayleigh the mean radius of such coils can be obtained with great precision by comparing them with larger coils wound with a single layer of wire the mean radius of which may be determined with sufficient accuracy by direct measurement The formulae em ployed by Rowland and Glazebrook in cal culating the mutual inductances of their coils are both approximate and do not agree with one another closely unless the coils have very small sections or are rather far apart Weinstein and Stefan both gave formulae for use in calculating the mutual inductance of such coils but they do not agree with one another as accurately as is desirable for precision work I have revised and corrected Weinsteins formula and derived a new formula starting where Stefan began these two fokrmulhe agreeing very closely and proving more accurate than any of the others These formule are sufficiently accurate for the most re fined work in the absolute measurement of resistance Remarkable Optical Properties of Carbo rundum LEwIs E JEWELL Some transparent blue plates of car borundum found in 1904 gave by pre liminary measures with a microscope a very high value for the refractive index Later in material received from the Car borundum Company of Niagara Falls were found some transparent and colorless plates some of which were fairly thick The polarization of the plates was studied with the polariscope and one specimen of twinned crystals produced a welldefined transparent colorless prism where the plates were joined Measurements with the spectrometer were made and the refraction proved to be greater than that of the diamond and the dispersion more than twice as great Spectrograms were obtained of the light transmitted through the plates and a thick ness of one thirtieth of a millimeter ab sorbed practically all light having a wave length less than 4000 Angstrom units Interference bands in the spectrum of light transmitted through their parallel plates gave greater values of the dispersion than the measurements with the spectromn eter Spectrograms have also been ob tained of the light reflected from the sur faces of the crystals and the reflective power which is extremely high differs very little in the visible and ultraviolet portions of the spectrum until a wave length of about 2400 is reached beyond which there seems to be an absorption band Very remarkable markings have been found upon some plates the most remark able of which take the form of spirals some of which are hexagonal and others triangular changing to hexagonal farther out Most of the spirals are however circular some of them are so close together and so regular as to form brilliant spectra even to the sixth or eighth order the lines in some cases are as close together as thirty or fifty thousand to the inch Many of these markings are extremely beautiful Sometimes there are two outer coatingsAPRIL 5 1907 SCIENCE 531 to the plates the outer an oxidation product giving the brilliant surfacecolors which are due to a thin film Sometimes there is another layer with an exceptionally brilliant silverlike surface The Absorption of Some Solids for Light of Short Wavelength THEODORE LY MAN The grating spectroscope which the au thor has used in his measurement of the hydrogen spectrum between 1650 and 1250 Angstr6m units though well adapted for the determination of wave lengths is not especially fitted for rapid work in other branches of the subject A prism spectroscope would be preferable for many purposes on account of its short light path and the superior intensity of its spectrum The first purpose therefore of the pres ent research was a purely practical one namely to find some substance from which the prism and lenses of such an instrument might be constructed White fluorite is the only known substance fitted for the purpose and it was hoped that a less costly substitute might be discovered In order to test rapidly the transparency of a great number of substances an in strument of special type was constructed In it the light from a discharge tube fell upon a concave mirror and was thrown by it through a fluorite prism on to a screen coated with willimite The whole appa ratus was enclosed in an airtight case which could be exhausted and filled with hydrogen The specimens to be examined were introduced into this case in such a manner that eight of them could be inter posed in succession between the mirror and source of light without opening the appa ratus The extent and intensity of the spectrum on the fluorescent screen was ob served through a glass window The substances examined were Colored fluorites quartz topaz gypsum celestite rock salt barite alum colemanite sugar rock candy borax adularia calcite chry soberyl sanidin anagonite and apophyl lite The results are I No substance shows so great trans parency as white fluorite II The transparency of colored fluorites varies through a considerable range but some light green specimens are nearly as good as the white variety III Colored fluorites may be deprived of their color by heating The process does not materially alter their trans parency IV Quartz in thicknesses of about 1 mm is transparent to X 1500 The absoro tion increases with such rapidity with the thickness that prisms and lenses would cut the spectrumw off at about X 1750 for all practical purposes V Of the remainiing substances Ceylon topaz is the best being transparent to A 1560 VI Rock salt is transparent to X 1750 only Geometrical Theory of Radiating Surfaces with Discussion of Light Tubes EDWARD P HYDE Theoretical photometry assumes two gen eral laws of radiation 1 The law of variation of the intensity of illumination of a surface in face in inverse proportion to the square of the distance of the surface from the luminous source is merely a state ment of a geometrical property if the rectilinear propagation of light is assumed 2 Lamberts law of variation of the in tensity of a luminous surface in direct proportion to the cosine of the angle of emission is an empirical law based pri marily on the observation that a uniformly bright sphere when viewed at a distance appears as a uniformly bright disk It would seem to follow from Kirchhoffs law532 SCIENCE LN S VOL XXV No 640 that Lamberts cosine law can be true oinly for a black body but no satisfactory ex periments have been made s far as the writer knows to test the law empirically in its application to glowing surfaces These two laws the inversesquare law and the cosine law are applicable to the infinitesimal elements of a radiating sur face and large errors may result if they are assumed to apply to an extended source as a whole Particularly is this so in the case of the inversesquare law which uin derlies the great majority of photometric measurements In eaeh of the above two cases the ex pression is deduced for the illumination at different distances in a single plane or along a single line symmetrical with re spect to the radiating surface In the case of a uniformly bright strip of infinite length but of finite width it is not difficult to derive the expression which will give the illumination at any point in space Instead of illumination however the more general term specific luminous flux is sub stituted At every point in space there is some definite direction in which the flux of luminous energy is a maximum The quantity of luminous energy which in one second flows normally across a surface of unit area placed perpendicular to the direc tion of maximum flux is defined as the specific luminous flux at the point It is a vector quantity and the component in any direction equals numerically the difference in illumination on the two sides of an in finitely thin material screen placed perpen dicular to the direction Two examples are given of the errors incident to assuming for a finite surface the inverse square law which only applies to the elements of the surface the above case of an infinite strip is used to show the errors incident to assuming for the strip as a whole the cosine law which is true only for the elements of surface of the strip The value of b00 at different distances in a direction normal to the strip at its middle point and in a direction making an angle of 450 with the normal at the middle point are calculated For any definite distance the former multiplied by cos 450 would equal the latter if the cosine law which has been assumed for the elements of sur face applied to the surface as a whole The difference between the two values gives the errors for the distance used and by plotting the errors for different distances a curve of deviation from the cosinelaw is obtained On the Magnetic Properties of HIeuslers Alloys J C MCLENNAN In this paper the author describes some experiments made during the past year by Messrs Dawes McTaggart and Robertson and Mr L B Johnston on the magneto striction and permeability of Heuslers alloys of varying composition From measurements on both phenomena the alloys are shown to be in an exceedingly unstable condition when freshly made and from observed changes in their magnetic behavior the conclusion is drawn that pro found modifications are made in their structure through the lapse of time as well as by their being subjected to changes in temperature and to repeated magnetiza tions and demagnetizations In connection with the phenomenon of magnetostriction the gradual shortening observed by Austin with rods of the alloys subjected to longcontinued high magnetic fields is shown to disappear when the rods have reached a stable condition after being repeatedly magnetized In a series of rods containing the same amount of manganese with varying amounts of aluminium the greatest elonga tion was observed with rods in which the manganese and aluminium were present in the ratio of their atomie weightsAPRIL 5 1907 SCIENCE 533 The paper concludes by emphasizing the suggestion made by Hill that possibly the magnetic properties of these alloys at room temperatures are largely determined by the temperatures from which they have been cooled and that by suitably heating samples of the alloys to different tempera tures and then chilling them their magnetic properties at these temperatures may be ascertained just as the structures of other alloys at different temperatures have been investigated in this way by Neville and Heycock On the Magnetic Susceptibilities of Mix tures of Salt Solutions J C MCLENNAN and C S WRIGHT In this paper the authors give some measurements on the magnetic susceptibili ties of solutions of manganese alunlinium and copper sulphates in water and several mixtures of these solutions made with the object of obtaining information which might be of service in explaining the be havior of the magnetic alloys recently dis covered by Heusler The method followed in measuring the susceptibilities is that suggested by Kelvin in which a glass cell of the solution investigated is placed in a strong magnetic field and the susceptibility deduced from the pull exerted on the solu tion by the field The magnetic susceptibility of water was found to be  733 X 10T Measure ments on a series of salt solutions gave the following molecular susceptibilities Ms Manganese sulphate MnSO 01491 Copper sulphate OUS04 00153 Aluminium sulphate Al SO48  00018 Aluminium nitrate AlNO9 00002 Aluminium chloride Al 010 00005 A set of measurements on solutions of manganese sulphate of different concentra tions showed that the molecular suscepti bility of the salt was independent of the conce4tration On Magnetic Shielding A P WILLS Assuming the results of a previous paper giving the shielding ratio for a set of three concentric spherical iron shells and for a similar set of cylindrical shells the following problem was discussed Given the innermost and outermost radii of the system in each case what values should the remaining four radii have in order that the shielding shall be a maximum Start ing with the expression giving the shield ing ratio the ratio of field impressed to field within innermost shell derived in the paper referred to above the conditions for a maximum of the expression under the conditions imposed are examined and it is found that approximately the best con ditions are obtained when the radii of the shells are in geometrical progression This holds for both spherical and cylindrical systems Models Illustrating the Motion of a Violin String HARVEY N DAVIS The function ux t which gives the dis placement at the time t of a pointx units from one end of a violin string can be represented graphically by a surface with the x t plane as a baseplane If the units were properly chosen this graph would be the surface wlhich the string would gener ate if while it vibrated it were also carried along in a direction perpendicular to the plane of its vibration and in any case a section of such a surface parallel to the x axis represents usually on a magni fied scale the configuration of the string at some corresponding time t  tD while one parallel to the t axis represents the dis placement of a corresponding point o as a function of the time Five surfaces of this kind modeled in three dimensions were shown represent ing one the general Helmholtzian solution and the other the motion of a string bowed at points 15 25 27 and 38 of its length534 SCIENCE N S VOL XXV No 640 from one end These particular cases were chosen because besides being typical they have some interest in connection with Youngs and KrigarMenzals observations on the absence or dominance of certain overtones when a string is bowed at or near one of their nodes The Motion of a Violin String under Light Bowing HARVEY N DAVIS This paper discusses the influence which the pressure of the bow upon the string has on the resulting vibration form For each bowing speed there is for compara tively great pressure a considerable range within which the only effect of a change in the pressure is a slight corresponding change in the position of equilibrium about which the string vibrates the vibration form being always that described by Helm holtz and others and the amplitude re maining the same For smaller pressures both the amplitude and the vibration form change with the pressure In particular if the pressure is below a certain critical value determined partly by the materials and condition of the apparatus and partly by the bowing speed no vibrations can be maintained For pressures slightly greater than this critical pressure there are no overtones the time graph of the displace ment of the point under the bow being the sine curve tangent at its point of greatest slope to a line representing the speed of the bow As the pressure is increased beyond this value the bowing speed remaining con stant the mode of vibration goes over con tinuously into the Helmholtzian form On Distributions of Nuclei and Ions in Dustfree Air CARL BARUS I have recently found it desirable to gather my data together for comparison There is in fact a serious discrepancy be tween Mr C T R Wilsons results and mine when reduced to the same scale Mr Wilsons supersaturations for negative ions and cloud are distinctly higher which cer tainly can not mean that my fog chamber is in these regions inferior to his own Thus in moderately ionized dustfree air my condensations begin at a drop of about 185 cm from 76 cm as compared with 205 in Wilsons apparatus similarly my fogs begin at the drop 203 Wilsons at 277 Furthermore at low ionization even the vapor nuclei of dustfree wet air become efficient in the presence of ions It seems impossible therefore that any positive ions should fail of capture The question is to be asked why I catch the negative ions etc at an apparently much lower supersatura tion than C T R Wilson I have enter tained doubts whether the inertia of the piston in his apparatus is initially quite negligible whether in any apparatus the computed adiabatic temperatures were ac tually reached Nobody has proved it and the case is worse for tubes Moreover in every apparatus there must be a limit at which the smaller nuclei of a graded system can no longer be caught in the presence of the larger nuclei But I do not believe that the real discrepancy will be found in any of these misgivings It seems to me to be inherent in this in Wilsons appa ratus the results are given from the ob served volume ratio v1v of adiabatic ex pansion in my method the results follow from the observed pressure ratio pp It seems questionable whether the customary constants by which one passes from one group of data to the other are really ap plicable to wet air at very low tempera tures Moreover when the

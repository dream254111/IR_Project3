ALSO TO HUNDREDS OF WORKMEN AND THE PUBLIC GENERALLY WHO ARE DAILY TRANSFERRED ON COMPLAINANTS CARS TO AND FROM THEIR WORK IN HAMPTON AND NEWPORT NEWS AND THE PRAYER IS THAT APPELLEES BE ENJOINED FROM

STREETS AVENUES AND ALLEYS LAID OFF ON THE MAP OF THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY IT WILL BE OBSERVED THAT THE SINGLE ISSUE PRESENTED BY THE PLEADINGS IS THE MATTER OF ESTOPPEL REFERRED TO IT WILL BE WELL

APPELLEES THEY ARE NOT PARTIES TO THE SUIT AND THEIR RIGHTS WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY ANY OF THE PROCEEDINGS THEREIN IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT THERE HAS BEEN AN ACCEPTANCE BY THE PUBLIC OF THE AVENUES

OBVIATED BY NOT CONFOUNDING THE ACTS AND CONDUCT OF THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY WITH THOSE OF APPELLEES FOR IT IS THE SETTLED LAW OF THIS STATE THAT NO COLLATERAL AGREEMENT OR UNAUTHORIZED REPRESENTATION MADE BY A MORTGAGOR CAN IMPAIR OR PREJUDICE THE RIGHTS OF A MORTGAGEE IT IS CLEAR THAT THE MORTGAGOR CANNOT BIND HIS MORTGAGEE BY ANY CONTRACT PREJUDICIAL TO HIS TITLE AND THE SAME PRINCIPLE APPLIES AS BETWEEN THE VENDEE AND HIS VENDOR WHO HAS RESERVED A LIEN FOR HIS PURCHASE MONEY BIGGS V ELLISTON DEVELOPMENT COMPANY 93 VA 404 A PURCHASER OF LAND SUBJECT TO A PRIOR DEED OF TRUST CANNOT DEDI CATE ANY PORTION OF THE LAND TO A PUBLIC STREET OR ROAD TO THE PREJU DICE OF THE RIGHTS OF THE FIRST CREDITOR OR PURCHASER UNDER THE DEED OF TRUST GATE CITY V RICHMOND 97 VA 337 AT PAGE 339 THE COURT SAYS WE ARE OF OPINION HOWEVER THAT WM D JONES WHO WAS A PURCHASER SUBJECT TO A PRIOR DEED OF TRUST HAD NO POWER TO DEDICATE THE GROUND TO A STREET IT WAS COVERED BY A DEED OF TRUST SECURING RIGHTS PRIOR TO AND HIGHER THAN HIS HE WAS ONLY EN TITLED TO THE EQUITY OF REDEMPTION AND COULD NOT GIVE AWAY A PART OF THE PROPERTY ANY MORE THAN THE WHOLE TO THE PREJUDICE OF THE DEED OF TRUST IN SUBORDINATION TO WHICH HE HELD THE RECORD TITLE OF APPELLEES WAS COMPLETE AND ON THAT TITLE THEY HAD A RIGHT TO RELY AND TO ASSUME THAT ALL PERSONS WHO DEALT WITH THE PROPERTY DID SO WITH NOTICE OF THEIR LIEN AND IN SUBORDINATION TO THEIR RIGHTS IT IS NOT TO BE PRESUMED THAT APPELLANTS PREDECESSOR IN TITLE WAS IGNORANT OF THE TRUE CONDITION OF THE TITLE OF THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY WITH WHOM IT PROPOSED TO ENTER INTO AN IMPORTANT AGREE MENT INVOLVING 5000 IN MONEY AND LAND AND 2045 FEET OF ITS ROADWAY AND TRACK INDEED THE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT IN ADDITION TO THE CONSTRUCTIVE NOTICE AFFORDED BY THE RECORDATION OF THE DEEDS THE RAILWAY COMPANY HAD ACTUAL NOTICE OF APPELLEES RIGHTS AND WITH SUCH NOTICE THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT IT TREATED WITH THE LAND COMPANY ALONE JUSTIFIES THE CONCLUSION THAT IT CHOSE TO ASSUME THE RISK OF THAT COMPANY PERFECTING ITS TITLE BY PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY AND DISCHARGING THE LIEN OF THE DEED OF TRUST AT ALL EVENTS IT HAD NOTICE AND CANNOT NOW VISIT UPON APPELLEES THE CONSEQUENCES OF ITS OWN IMPRUDENCE UNLESS APPELLEES WERE IN SOME WAY RESPON28 9 VIRGSINIA LAW REGISTER MAY SIBLE FOR THE UNTOWARD CONDITIONS WITH WHICH APPELLANT IS NOW CONFRONTED COMING THEN TO THE CONSIDERATION OF APPELLANTS CONTENTION THAT APPELLEES KNEW OF THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NEWPORT NEWS COM PANY AND THE NEWPORT NEWS HAMPTON AND OLD POINT RAILWAY CORMPANY FOR THE EXTENSION OF ITS RAILWAY OVER AND ALONG VENABLE AVENUE AND WITH SUCH KNOWLEDGE ACQUIESCED IN THE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF THE ROAD IT APPEARS THAT THE ALLEGATION OF THE BILL IN THAT REGARD IS EXPLICITLY DENIED BY THE ANSWERS BOTH OF APPELLEES AND THE TRUSTEE COLONEL TABBAND THE DENIAL IN THE ANSWERS IS REPEATED BY J B LAKE IN HIS DEPOSITION THE ONLY DIRECT COUNTERVAILING EVIDENCE IF IT CAN BE SO REGARDED IS THAT OF S S ELAM SECRETARY OF THE LAND COMPANY WHO TESTIFIED THAT MR LAKE AND HIMSELF DISCUSSED THE PROBABILITY OF THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY FULFILLING ITS UNDERTAKING WITH THE RAILWAY COMPANY BUT IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT THIS WITNESS DID NOT KNOW OF THE AGREEMENT HIMSELF UNTIL AFTER IT HAD BEEN MADE AND HIS TESTIMONY IS THERE FORE NOT NECESSARILY IN CONFLICT WITH THAT OF LAKE THERE IS ABSO LUTELY NO EVIDENCE IN THE RECORD THAT APPELLEES BY WORD OR ACT EVER RATIFIED THE AGREENIENT IF THEY HAD ADOPTED AND CONFIRMED THE AGREEMENT AS ALLEGED IT IS NOT PERCEIVED WHY APPELLEES ARE NOT UNDER THE SAME OBLIGATION TO PAY THE MONEY CONSIDERATION AND CONVEY THE LOTS STIPULATED FOR AS TO DONATE A RIGHT OF WAY OVER THEIR LAND BOTH REQUIREMENTS ARE PROVIDED FOR IN THE CONTRACT AND EACH OCCUPIES THE SAME PLANE YET IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT APPELLEES OWE APPELLANT 5000 IN MONEY AND LAND IT DISTINCTLY APPEARS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF J B LAKE THAT HE PROMPTLY OBJECTED TO THE INVASION OF THE PREMISES BV THE RAILWAY COMPANY TO J S DARLING THE PROMOTER AND PRINCIPAL OWNER HE FULLY EXPLAINED TO DARLING THAT APPELLEES HAD SOLD THE PROPERTY TO THE LAND COMPANY RESERVING A LIEN AND IN CASE OF ITS FAILURE TO PERFECT ITS TITLE BV PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE HE OBJECTED TO THE ROAD PASSING THROUGH THE PROPERTY WITHOUT PROPER COMPENSATION AFTER GIVING IN DETAIL THAT CONVERSATION HE TESTIFIED AS FOLLOWS I MADE EVERY EFFORT IN ORDER TO GET A SETTLEMENT AND LET THEM KNOW HOW I STOOD ALL THE WAY ALONG FROM BEGINNING TO END I FAILED TO GET ANY SATISFACTION FROM ANY OF THE PARTIES I HAVE KEPT UP A RUNNING FIRE FOR A SETTLEMENT AND SATISFACTION ALL OF WHICIH I FAILED TO GET IF I LEFT A STONE UN TURNED I DO NOT KNOW IT HE FURTHER TESTIFIED THAT AFTER APPELLEES REPURCHASED THE PROP1903 NEWPORT NEWS ETC CO V LAKE 29 ERTY HE ADDRESSED A LETTER TO THE PRESIDENT OF THE PRESENT COMPANY INFORMING HIM THAT THE OLD COMPANY HAD TAKEN HIS PROPERTY WITHOUT CONSULTING HIM AND WITHOUT HIS CONSENT THAT HE DID NOT WISH TO INTERFERE WITH HIM BUT WANTED TO SAY TO HIM THAT THE COMPANY HAD NEVER ACQUIRED THE RIGHT OF WAY FROM HIM IN THAT CONNECTION HE SAYS JUST ABOUT THE TIME MR PAYNE PRESIDENT OF APPELLANT COM PANY WAS NEGOTIATING WITH MR DARLING I THOUGHT IT DUE TO MR PAYNE TO LET HIM KNOW HOW THE MATTER STOOD THAT I HAD NEVER RELEASED MY RIGHT OF WAY TO THE ROAD THAT I HAD OBJECTED FROM BEGINNING TO END AND THERE WAS NO REASON WHY I SHOULD NOT OBJECT THE ONLY DISCREPANCY BETWEEN THE STATEMENT OF THIS WITNESS AND THAT OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE NEW COMPANY IN RELATION TO THE COM MUNICATION IS AS TO ITS DATE THE LATTER TESTIFYING THAT IT WAS AFTER THE SALE HAD BEEN CONSUMMATED LAKES EVIDENCE IS STRONGLY COR ROBORATED BY THAT OF THOMAS TABB WHO SAYS HE ALWAYS INSISTED UPON THE FACT THAT THE ROAD HAD POSSESSION OF LAND WHICH BELONGED TO HIM AND HE WANTED COMPENSATION FOR IT AND FURTHER THAT THE RELATIONS BETWEEN LAKE AND DARLING WERE STRAINED BY REASON OF THEIR DIFFERENCE IN RESPECT TO THE RIGHT OF WAY FRANK WV DARLING PRESIDENT AND SUPERINTENDENT OF THE OLD COM PANY AND A DIRECTOR OF THE PRESENT COMPANY TESTIFIED THAT HIS AGREE MENT FOR A RIGHT OF WAY ALONG VENABLE AVENUE WAS WHOLLY WITH THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY THAT HE RELIED UPON THE CONTRACT OF THAT COMPANY FOR HIS PROTECTION AND DID NOT THINK HE NEEDED A RIGHT OF WAY FROM ANY ONE ELSE THAT SO FAR AS HE KNOWS LAKE NEVER AUTHORIZED HIS COMPANY TO GO UPON THE LAND AND DID NOTHING TO INDUCE THEM TO DO SO AND THAT HE DID NOT LOOK TO THE LAKES BUT TO THE LAND COMPANY FOR A RIGHT OF WAY OVER THE PROPERTY IN THE LIGHT OF THIS UNCONTRADICTED EVIDENCE IT WOULD BE INDEED A SINGULAR PERVERSION OF THE DOCTRINE OF EQUITABLE ESTOPPEL TO HOLD THAT IT DEPRIVES APPELLEESCLOTHED WITH A COMPLETE LEGAL TITLE AND WHO HAVE RESORTED TO EVERY MEANS IN THEIR POWER SHORT OF PHYSICAL FORCE TO PREVENT AN INVASION OF THEIR PREMISES OF THEIR LAND ON THE THEORY OF ACQUIESCENCE TITLE TO REAL PROPERTY RESTS UPON NO SUCH UNSTABLE FOUNDATION IN THIS COMMONWEALTH AS REGARDS THE TITLE OF THE LAKES THE RAILWAY COMPANY WAS AN INTRUDER UPON THEIR PREMISES AND THERE IS NO LAW WHICH COMPELS A MAN TO PROTEST AGAINST A WRONGFUL ENTRY UPON HIS LAND AT THE PERIL OF BEING HELD TO RATIFY IT BOTH PARTIES KNEW THEIR RIGHTS THE30 9 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY LAW PROVIDES A MODE IN WHICH A PARTY SEEKING TO OBTAIN PROPERTY FOR PUBLIC USE MAY DO SO LAWFULLY IF SUCH A PARTY DISREGARDS THE MODE PRESCRIBED AND ENTERS UPON PROPERTY WITHOUT CONSENT IT IS A WRONG DOER AND CAN ACQUIRE NO RIGHT BY EXPENDING MONEY ON THE PROPERTY

THE NEWPORT NEWS COMPANY WHICH IT IS CONTENDED SHOWS THAT AN ELECTRIC RAILWAY WAS TO BE CONSTRUCTED THROUGH THE PROPERTY IT IS APPARENT THAT THE REFERENCE IN THE DEED OF TRUST AND DEEDS OF RELEASE TO THOSE DOCU MENTS WAS MERELY IN CONNECTION WITH A DESCRIPTION OF THE RELEASED LOTS FURNISHED BY THE FORMER AND THE PRICE LIST CONTAINED IN THE LATTER THAT WILL BE SEEN FROM THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE DEED OF TRUST IT IS COVENANTED BETWEEN THE PARTIES HERETO THAT AT ANY TIME    THE SAID TRUSTEES SHALL EXECUTE A RELEASE    OF ANY ONE OR MORE OF SAID LOTS AS LAID DOWN IN THE SAID PLAT FOR THE

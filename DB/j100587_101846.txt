Member of the Royal Society,i206881,88 A Discourse on this P R O B L E M Why Bodies dissolved in Menstrua Specifically lighter than themselves swim therein By Mr WILLIAM MOLYNEUX of Dublin Member of the Royal Society THe Liberty of Philosophising being now universally granted between all men I am sure that a difference in Opinion will be no breach of affection between two intire ly Loving Brothers And therefore I shall take the free dom to Propose my Own thoughts in a matter wherein my Brother Mr Thomas Molyneux hath Appeared publickly in the Novelles de la Republique des Lettres Mois d Aout 1684 Art 4 and Mois de Janvier 1685 Art 7 The Problem proposed is Why Bodies dissolved float in Liquors lighter than themselves as for Example Mercury dissolved in strong Spirit of Nirte swims therein tho each small Particle of Mercury be far heavyer than so much of the Liquor whose place it occupies This says he cannot be solved by the prime Law of Hydrostaticks which is that a Body which in an equal Quantity is heavyer than a like quantity of Li quor sinks in that Liquor thus a Cubick Inch of Iron be ing heavier than a Cubick Inch of AquaFortis and each Particle how small soever of Iron being heavier then a like Particle of AquaFortis Iron being put into Aqua Fortis should sink and yet we find that Iron being dissol ved in a convenient Quantity of AquaFortis floats therein and does not fall to the Bottom The Reason which my Brother gives for this is that the Internal Motion of the Parts of the Liquor does keep up the Particles of the dis solved89 solved Solid for they being so very Minute are Moveable by the least Force imaginable and the Action of the Par ticles of the Menstruum is sufficient to drive the Atomes of the dissolved solid Body from place to place and conse quently notwithstanding their Gravity they do not sink in the Liquor lighter than themselves As a Proof of this in the 7th Article of Janvier 1685 he offers an Experiment known in Chymistry that a Menstruum over a digesting Fire as the Chymist speaks will dissolve a greater Quantity of a Body put into it than when tis off the Fire and if it be taken off the Fire and suffered to cool a great Portion will precipitate of that which was perfectly dissolved whilst the Menstruum continued hot For says he the Particles of the Menstruum acquire a more violent agitation by the Fire and are therefore able to raise and keep up a greater Quan tity of the dissolved Body or hereby they are able to Re sist a greater Gravity It has been objected against this Notion that the com mon Experiment of precipitation by mixing an Alkaly with an Acid seems to contradict this for thereby the Fluidity of the Menstruum is not taken away and consequently the internal Agitation of its Parts is not diminished and yet thereupon the Particles of the dissolved Body precipitate all to the Bottom To this he answers in the forecited Article of January that all Mixtures of different Liquors intro duce in each a different Conformation of Pores and there fore the Infusion of a new Liquor drives the insensible Parts of the dissolved Body from their Places and forces them to strike against each other and cling together and so becoming more big and heavyer than formerly the in ternal Agitation of the Liquor is no longer able to move and sustain them and consequently they fall to the Bottom This as fairly and shortly as I can propose it is his Sen timent of this Phaenomenon M 2 But90 But I conceive another Account may be given of this Appearance and that the foresaid Law of Hydrosta ticks is a little deficient Tis true indeed if we consider only the specifick Gravity of a Liquor and the specifick Gravity of a solid Particle floating therein the forementio ned Rule is exact but in sinking there is a requisite sepa ration of the Parts of the Liquor by the sinking Body and there being a natural Inclination in the Parts of all Liquors to Union arising from an Agreement or Congruity of their Parts there is a resistance therein to any thing that separates this Conjunction Now unless a Body have weight enough to overcome this Congruity or Union of Parts such a Body will float in a Liquor specifically lighter than it self But that a heavy Body as Mercury or Iron may have its Parts reduced to that Minuteness that their Gravity or Tenden cy downwards is not strong enough to separate the Cohesi on or Union of the Parts of a Liquor will be manifest if we consider that the Resistance made by the Medium to a falling Body is according to the Superficies of the Body but as the Body decreases in Bulk its Superficies does not proportionably decrease thus a Sphere of an Inch Diame ter has not eight times less Superficies than a Sphere of two Inches Diameter tho it have eight times less Bulk and consequently passing through a Medium as suppose Air or Water the Sphere of an Inch Diameter is proportionably to its Bulk more resisted than a Sphere of two Inches Dia meter in proportion to its Bulk and hence it will come to pass that at last a Body may be reduced to that Minute ness that its Gravity pressing downwards which is ac cording to its Bulk may be less than the resistance of the Medium which operates on the Surface of the Body see ing as I said before the Surfaces of Bodies do not decrease so fast as their Bulks these decreasing in a Triplicate but those in a Duplicate Ratio of the Bodies Diameters This Account does not at all oppose the Experiment of a  over the Fire being able to dissolve or sustain a91 a greater Quantity of a heavy Body for the Reason of this as tis given by my Brother does not Contradict my Notion The Account likewise that He gives of Chymi cal Precipitation agrees very well with what I propose So that of these I shall say no more But because in the beginning of my Discourse I say that the forementioned Law of Hydrostaticks is a little defective I desire to explain my self a little further in that Point In Weights falling through the Air were Gravity only consi derd the Proportions of their Descents would be exactly as Galileo has Demonstrated but it is allowd by all that the Resistance of the Air not being considerd in those Demon strations they are not Mathematically true in Practice but that Really there is something of that Proportion hin dred by the Airs Resistance Now what is this less than to say that the Resistance of the Air takes off some of the Operation of Gravity or is able to withstand or oppose part of its Action And if so what shall we say were an Iron Sphere let through a Medium of Water Surely the Proportions of its descents would be much more disturbed herein as Water is much more solid and difficult to be separated or passed through than Air and consequently we must needs Grant that more of the Operation of Gravity is taken off or Resisted by this Opposition of the Water than that of the Air And if so Surely there may be a certain degree of Gravity that may be quite taken off by the Resistance of the Water Were a Pistol Bullet let fall through the Air it would Descend imper ceptibly nigh the Proportions that Galileo has assigned but were a single grain of Sand so let fall it would be much hin dred in its Course and the half of this Grain would be more obstructed what shall we then say of the ten thou sandth part or of a part the ten thousand millionth of this and again of the Infinite Subdivisions of that till at last we come to a part that would be wholly resisted or kept up such92 such as I conceive the Minute particles of a Body dissolved in a Menstruum On this account tis I say that the forementioned Prin ciple of Hydrostaticks is a little defective for it considers not the Natural Congruity of the Parts of a Liquor whereby they desire as twere to unite and keep together just as we see two Drops of Water on a Dry Board being brought together do jump and Coalesce and therefore Liquors have an innate Power of Resisting a certain degree of force that would separate them such as I suppose the degree of Gra vity in the most Minute Particles of a Body dissolved in a Menstruum The forementioned Rule holds true to the most nice Sense in Great Bodies but in those that are by many Mil lions of Divisions Smaller it seems to fail This in short is my Conjecture in this matter which I propose as my Brother did his with all submission imagi nable and thereby to give occasion to others to enquire in to the Causes of this appearance rather than to publish my own sentiment as the undoubted solution thereof But this I must acknowledge that the Internal motion of the parts of a Liquor seems so very agreeable to truth and explicates so many Phaenomenea easily and plainly that I would not be thought to deny it Neither would I be thought wholly to Reject my Brothers solution of this Pro blem for certainly that Motion whatsoever it is in a Menstruum which is able to Dissolve such a solid Body as Iron that is which is able to disturb the close and strong Cohesion of the Parts of Iron may very well be supposed sufficient to disturb or keep up these parts from resting in the Bottom of the Vessel wherein the solution was made And certainly no better account can possibly be given of such solutions than by supposing such an Internal motion in the Parts of the Menstruum insinuating themselves into the solid body and loosening its Parts And tho it may be objected that in the Parts of Water there may be supposed as93 as Violent an Internal motion as in the Parts of AquaFortis and yet we see Water will not dissolve Iron as AquaFortis does and Common BeesWax is disturbed by neither of them I leave the Nice Enquiry after this point to others viz What kind of Motion and peculiar Conformation of parts is requisite both in the Menstruum and in the Dissolved Body that a solution may result from their Commixture Some Reflections on the foregoing Paper by Mr T M What my Brother has laid down in this Discourse I think does most undeniably evince that the received Law of Hydrostaticks is somewhat defective For Liquors tho they are Fluid yet they are Bodies and therefore consist of parts united which Union tho it be easily destroyd yet of necessity it requires some degree of Force for the effecting it nor is it more manifest if rightly considerd that a Flint requires Force for the separation of its parts than that Fluids do for theirs But however I imagine this Pro perty ought not to be relyd upon as the sole Cause of this Appearance to which my Brother has applyd it nay perhaps does not so much as concur the least in the produ cing this effect my Reason in short is this whatever is of sufficient Power to raise the minute Particles of a Heavy Body in a light Fluid is certainly a sufficient cause to keep them in that state now my Supposition may give some account of this what my Brother says never can for he must necessarily suppose them first raised and then he gives the reason of their not sinking Whereas tis not to be questioned but that that Force which raised them is the same that keeps them from falling to the bottom But these Conjectures for I esteem them no more I leave to the Consideration of those that desire to enquire further into this Matter A

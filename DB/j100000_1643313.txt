nitrates in accordance with a report filed by the Nitrate Supply Committee This report is given in part below It is further stated that for the present the location of the proposed ni trate plant is withheld but information con cerning its location will be given as soon as a definite decision is reached The work of sup plying the machinery and materials needed for the plant has begun The Nitrate Supply Committee appointed by the Secretary of War was under authority of a provision in the national defense act for an investigation to determine the best 256 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 14 1917 cheapest and most available means for the pro duction of nitrates and other products for munitions of war and useful in the manufac ture of fertilizers and other products The general recommendations and report of the Nitrate Supply Committee are announced as follows After a deliberate and careful consideration of all the matter and information at the dis posal of the committee it submits the follow ing as its action 1 The committee appreciating the offer of the General Chemical Company recommends that the government enter into negotiations to acquire the rights to use the synthetic am monia process of that company 2 That contingent upon satisfactory ar rangements with the General Chemical Com pany out of the 20000000 nitrate supply ap propriation such sum as may be needed now estimated at 3000000 be placed at the dis posal of the War Department to be used in building a synthetic ammonia plant employ ing the said process of the General Chemical Company and of a capacity of 60000 pounds of ammonia per twentyfourhour day said plant to be located in a region where land water coal and sulphuric acid are cheaply available where good transportation facilities exist and where the proposed new powder plant of the government can be properly located In the opinion of this committee all of these con ditions just enumerated are best fulfilled by a location in southwest Virginia or contiguous region 3 That out of the 20000000 nitrate sup ply appropriation an amount now estimated at 600000 or as much as may be needed be placed at the disposal of the War Department to be used in building a plant for the oxidation of ammonia to nitric acid and the concentra tion of nitric acid of a capacity equivalent to 24000 pounds of 100 per cent nitric acid in a twentyfourhour day said plant to be located in the neighborhood of the aforesaid synthetic ammonia plant and the proposed new powder plant of the government 4 That the War Department proceed at the earliest practical date with the construction of the oxidation plant and contingent upon a sat isfactory arrangement with the General Chem ical Company also with the synthetic am monia plant and that the government give such priority orders as will secure from con tractors prompt delivery of the materials and rapid construction of the structure and ma chinery needed for those plants 5 The committee appreciating the offer of the Nitrogen Products Company granting in this country to the government under certain conditions the right to use the socalled Bucher process for the production of sodium cyanide and ammonia recommends that a form of contract drawn with the advice of the legal authorities of the government such as to give that company no guaranty or ex clusive rights in the process or in its future development beyond those which the com panys own patents give to it be entered into with the Nitrogen Products Company and that experimentation looking toward the in dustrial development of the Bucher process for the production of ammonia be at once pro ceeded with And further that contingent upon a satisfactory arrangement with the Nitrogen Products Company a sum not to exceed 200000 be allotted for this purpose out of the 20000000 nitrate supply appro priation 6 That out of the 20000000 nitrate supply appropriation 100000 be made avail able for the active prosecution of investiga tions of processes for the industrial produc tion of nitrogen compounds useful in the manufacture of explosives or of fertilizers and that these investigations be planned and super vised by the War Department 7 That in order to increase the production of ammonia and toluol the government pro mote the installation of byproduct coke ovens by directing that priority be given in the pro duction delivery and transportation of the materials and parts needed in their construc tion 8 That the decision as to more extensive installation of nitrogen fixation processes and water power development in connection with them be postponed until the plants above rec SCIENCE 257N S VOL XLVI No 1185 ommended are in operation or until further need arises 9 While the preceding recommendations in clude all the measures that can now judiciously be taken for the fixation of nitrogen and the oxidation of ammonia it is the opinion of the committee that the immediate accumula tion and the permanent maintenance of an ample reserve not less than 500000 tons of Chile saltpeter is the measure most urgently necessary The Nitrate Supply Committee comprised the following Army and Navy officers scien tific men and engineers Brig Gen

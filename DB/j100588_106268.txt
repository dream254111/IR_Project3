J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,106268,A NEW METHOD OF FINDING TIME BY EQUAL ALTITUDES BY ALEXANDER AUBERT ESQ F R S,I206931,92 MR AUBERTS METHOD OF IV A NEW METHOD OF FINDING TIME BY EQUAL ALTITUDES BY ALEXANDER AUBERT ESQ F R S A M O N G THE VARIOUS METHODS PRACTISED FOR FINDING TIME THAT BY EQUAL ALTITUDES OF THE SUN OR OF A STAR HATH HITHERTO BEEN ESTEEMED THE MOST ELIGIBLE FOR OBSERVERS WHO ARE NOT FURNISHED WITH A GOOD AND WELLADJUSTED TRANSIT INSTRUMENT BUT THIS METHOD ALTHOUGH ONE OF THE BEST IS GENERALLY ATTENDED WITH IN CONVENIENCIES WHICH RENDER THE PRACTICE OF IT MORE DIF FICULT AND THE RESULT LESS PERFECT THAN ONE COULD WISH R NOV 9 1775 IF THE SUN OR STARS NEAR THE EQUATOR ARE MADE USE OF AS USUAL AND THE ALTITUDES ARE TAKEN NEAR THE PRIME VER TICAL WHERE THE CHANGE OF ALTITUDE IS THE QUICKEST THE IN TERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN THE OBSERVATIONS MUST IN MOST LATITUDES BE OF SO MANY HOURS THAT THE OBSERVER CANNOT ALWAYS ATTEND TO THE CORRESPONDING ALTITUDES THE WEATHER MAY PROVE VARIABLE SO AS TO DISAPPOINT HIM AT LAST THE CLOCK OR WATCH MAY GO IRREGULARLY DURING SO LONG AN IN TERVAL AND IF THE ALTITUDES CANNOT ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GREAT DISTANCE FROM THE MERIDIAN BE TAKEN VERY HIGH AN ALTERATION IN THE STATE OF THE ATMOSPHERE MAY PRODUCE A VARIATION OF THE REFRACTION AND OCCASION THE HORARY ARCS TO BE DIFFERENT ALTHOUGH THE APPARENT ALTITUDES WILL BE THE SAME TO WHICH MAY BE ADDED THE DIFFICULTY OF MAKINGFINDING TIME BY EQUAL ALTITUDES 93 MAKING THE INSTRUMENT FOLLOW THE OBJECT IN ITS MOTION IN AZIMUTH WITHOUT DANGER OF DISTURBING ITS ADJUSTMENT IN REGARD TO ALTITUDE TO REMEDY ALL THESE INCONVENIENCIES THE FOLLOWING METHOD WAS THOUGHT OF AND HAVING BEEN PRACTISED WITH CONSTANT SUCCESS IT IS PRESUMED THE COMMUNICATION OF IT MAY BE ACCEPTABLE TO ASTRONOMERS IF A STAR IS SELECTED OF WHICH THE POLAR DISTANCE IS VERY LITTLE LESS THAN THE COMPLEMENT OF THE LATITUDE OF THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION IT WILL AT EQUAL DISTANCES FROM THE MERIDIAN COME TO VERTICAL CIRCLES WHICH TOUCH ITS PARALLEL OF DECLINATION THE STAR WHEN IN THESE VER TICAL CIRCLES WILL BE NEAR THE MERIDIAN NEAR THE PRIME VERTICAL AND NEAR THE ZENITH AND CONSEQUENTLY IF IT BE OBSERVED THERE THE INTERVAL BETWEEN THE EASTERN AND THE WESTERN ALTITUDES WILL BE SHORT THE ALTERATION IN ALTITUDE WILL BE QUICK THE STAR CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY A DIFFERENT REFRACTION BESIDES IT WILL HAVE NO MOTION IN AZIMUTH TO OBSERVE THE STAR IN THESE VERTICAL CIRCLES TWO THINGS ARE NECESSARY THE FIRST IS TO BE PROVIDED WITH AN ASTRO NOMICAL QUADRANT HAVING THREE OR MORE HORIZONTAL WIRES IN THE TELESCOPE AND IF IT HAVE ALSO A SPECULUM AT THE EYEEND OF THE TELESCOPE TO BRING THE VERTICAL RAY HORIZONTAL IT WILL BE FOUND VERY CONVENIENT THE NEXT THING IS TO MAKE A COMPUTATION OF THE APPARENT ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE STAR IN THE VERTICAL CIRCLES WHICH TOUCH ITS PARALLEL OF DECLINATION FOR IF THE TELESCOPE BE FIXED TO THIS ZENITH DISTANCE AS SOON AS THE STAR IS FOUND94 MR AUBERTS METHOD OF FOUND TO COME TO IT IT WILL BE IN THE PROPER VERTICAL CIRCLE THE TRUE ZENITH DISTANCE IS FOUND EASILY IN THE FOLLOW ING MANNER AND IF DIMINISHED BY THE REFRACTION BE LONGING TO IT IT WILL GIVE THE APPARENT ZENITH DISTANCE WANTED LET HMOM REPRE M SENT THE HORIZON Z THE ZENITH MM THE MERI DIAN P THE POLE OF THE   P EQUATOR  THE PARAL W E LEL OF DECLINATION OF A STAR INTERSECTING THE H Z O MERIDIAN VERY NEAR THE ZENITH BETWEEN Z AND P THEN THE VERTICAL CIRCLES ZE ON THE EAST ERN SIDE OF THE MERI M DIAN AND ZW ON THE WESTERN SIDE BEING DRAWN TO TOUCH THE PATH OF THE STAR THE HOUR CIRCLES PASSING THROUGH THE POINTS OF CONTACT E W WILL BE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE CIRCLES OF AZIMUTH ZE ZW NOW IN THE RIGHTANGLED SPHERIC TRIANGLE PEZ PZ THE COMPLEMENT OF THE LATITUDE AND PE THE STARS POLAR DIS TANCE BEING KNOWN THE OTHER PARTS ARE EASILY FOUND VIZ ZE THE ZENITH DISTANCE PZE THE AZIMUTH ZPE THE HORARY ANGLE SO THAT THE TELESCOPE MAY BE FIXED PRO PERLY THE POSITION OF THE INSTRUMENT IS ASCERTAINED AND THE TIME KNOWN WHEN THE STAR MAY BE EXPECTED IN THE FIELDFINDING TIME BY EQUAL ALTITUDES 95 FIELD OF THE TELESCOPE AND IF THE VERTICAL WIRE IS ONCE BROUGHT NEAR TO THE STAR THE STAR WILL APPEAR TO MOVE PARALLEL TO IT AND WILL PASS SUCCESSIVELY OVER THE HORIZON TAL WIRES WHILE THE INSTRUMENT REMAINS UNDISTURBED THE ADVANTAGE OF THIS METHOD WILL APPEAR IN THE FOL LOWING EXAMPLE OF EQUAL ALTITUDES TAKEN THE 15TH JULY 1773 AT LOAMPIT HILL NEAR DEPTFORD IN LATITUDE 51 28 7 N AND LONGITUDE 5 IN TIME W OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT GREENWICH THE

SET OF ALTITUDES WAS OB TAINED NEAR THE PRIME VERTICAL FREE FROM THE EFFECTS OF A DIFFERENT REFRACTION AND ANY MOTION IN AZIMUTH THE HORARY96 MR AUBERTS METHOD OF HORARY ARC OBSERVED BY THE MIDDLE WIRE NOT TURNING OUT EXACTLY ACCORDING TO THE COMPUTATION IS OF NO CONSE QUENCE TO THE OBSERVATIONS SOME LITTLE DIFFERENCE MAY ARISE IN IT FROM SMALL INACCURACIES IN THE ESTIMATION OF THE STARS APPARENT POLAR DISTANCE THE LATITUDE OF THE PLACE OR THE ERROR OF THE LINE OF COLLIMATION OR FROM NOT SETTING THE TELESCOPE EXACTLY TO THE PROPER ZENITH DISTANCE BUT AS THE CHIEF INTENTION OF THE COMPUTATION IS TO FIND THE VERTICAL CIRCLES IN WHICH THE STAR HATH NO MOTION IN AZI MUTH THE OTHER PARTS OF IT NEED NOT BE STRICTLY ATTENDED TO THE FOLLOWING MANNER OF INSERRING MEAN TIME FROM THE STARS MERIDIAN PASSAGE BEING MORE CONVENIENT AND CONCISE THAN THE USUAL ONE MAY ALSO BE ACCEPTABLE FROM THE STARS APPARENT RIGHT ASCENSION INCREASED BY 24 HOURS IF NECESSARY SUBTRACT THE SUNS APPARENT RIGHT ASCENSION FOR APPARENT NOON DIMINISH THE REMAINDER BY THE PROPORTIONAL PART OF THE STARS ACCELERATION AT THE RATE OF 3 5591 FOR 24 HOURS OF WHICH A TABLE IS EASILY COM PUTED TO THIS LAST

APPARENT NOON OF THEIR MERIDIAN MAY APPLY BOTH AS THEY ARE GIVEN IN THE NAUTICAL EPHEMERIS FOR THE MERI DIAN OF THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT GREENWICH THE RESULT WILL BE THE MEAN TIME OF THE STARS PASSING

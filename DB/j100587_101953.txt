H E LEARNED AUTHOR DECLARING HIMSELF UNSATISFIED WITH THE FORMER HYPOTHESIS ABOUT THE PRODUCTION OF INTERMITTING FEVERS BUT SUPPOSING FROM THE CONSI DERATION OF THE SYMPTOMS THAT THEIR ORIGINE IS OWING TO THE NERVOSUM GENUS HAS AGREEABLY TO THAT CONJE CTURE FORMED TO HIMSELF A NEW ONE BY WHICH HAVING REVOLVD IT LONG IN HIS THOUGHTS HE THINKS HE CAN GIVE HIMSELF A CLEARER ACCOUNT OF THE REASON BOTH OF THE SYM PTOMS AND METHOD OF CURE PARTICULARLY THAT BY THE COR TEX PERUVIANUS THAN FROM WHAT OTHERS HAVE LAID DOWN TO CLEAR HIS WAY TO IT HE FIRST TAKES NOTICE OF FOUR HYPOTHESES CONCERNING THEM WHICH HAVE EITHER CHIEFLY OBTAINED ORHE THINKS ARE THE MOST CONSIDERABLE VIZ THAT OF THE ANCIENTS WHO DEDUCE THEM FROM HUMOURS PUTRI FYING IN PRIMIS VIIS OF SYLVIUS WHO PLACES HIS MINERA IN THE PANCREAS OF DR WILLIS IN THE MASS OF BLOOD OF DR JONES IN THE HABIT OF THE BODY OF HIS DISTENT FROM EACH OF WHICH HE ALLEDGES SOME REASONS THOUGH IN THE GENERAL AGREEABLY TO THREE OF THEM THAT A FERMENT TO BE SOMEWHERE RECONDED OUT OF THE ROAD OF THE CIRCU LATING BLOOD AND THERE GRADUALLY MATURATED IS NECESSARY TO PRODUCE AN INTERPOLATE DISTEMPER IN658 IN ORDER TO DETERMINE BOTH THE MATTER AND FORM OF THIS FERMENT HE LAYS DOWN SOME OBVIOUS CONDITIONS OF IT OF WHICH THOUGH SOME MAY AGREE TO ONE SOME TO ANOTHER OF THE ENUMERATED HYPOTHESES YET HE ENDEAVOURS TO SHEW THAT ALL WILL NOT AGREE TO ANY ONE OF THEM AND THEREFORE THINKS SUCH A ONE IS TO BE SEARCHED FOR TO WHICH THEY EASILY WILL HIS OWN OPINION THEREFORE IS THAT THE CORTICAL PART OF THE BRAIN MAY BE THE PRIMARY SEAT OF THIS FEBRILE FERMENT AND THAT THE LIQUOR TO BE THERE SEPARATED BE COMING DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE ANIMAL FUNCTIONS IS THE MINERA OF IT AND BEING THENCE DISPENSED INTO ALL PARTS OF THE SYSTEMA NERVORUM MAY BY DEGREES RISE TO SUCH A MATURATION AS MAY PRODUCE THE FITS HERE HE TAKES OCCASION TO ENDEAVOUR TO ESTABLISH THE EXISTENCE OF THE NERVOUS JUYCE IN CONFIRMATION OF WHAT HE HAD HERETOFORE DELIVERED AND INDEED FOR A MAIN AR GUMENT TO EVINCE IT TO REVIVE AND FARTHER MAKE OUT BY A SOMEWHAT LONG DEDUCTION THE OPINION OF DR ENT GLISSON C THAT WE ARE NOT ONLY DIRECTIVELY BUT MA TERIALLY NOURISHED BY THAT JUICE FOR A PARTICULAR AC COUNT OF WHICH WE REFER TO THE AUTHOR TO THIS NOTION OF HIS HE ENDEAVOURS TO SHEW THAT THE ALLEDGED CONDITIONS ALL AGREE WHICH DONE HE LAYS DOWN HIS HYPOTHESIS OF THE MANNER OF THE PRODUCTION OF THE PAROXYSME MINUTELY SUPPOSING THAT SOME INCON GRUOUS THOUGH AT FIRST INOFFENSIVE MATTER ON THE SCORE OF PROCATARCTICK CAUSES HE POINTS AT BEING ADMITTED IN TO THE ROOTS OF THE NERVES IN THE CORTICAL PART OF THE BRAIN IS FROM THEM PROPELLED INTO THE MEDULLARY AND THENCE INTO THE TRACTS OF THE NERVES AND FIBRES WHICH HE TAKES TO BE BUT PROPAGINES NERVORUM OF THE WHOLE BODY IN WHICH MOVING SLOWLY IT BY DEGREES MATURATES INTO A FERMENTATIVE SUBSTANCE AND ACQUIRES AN ACRIMONY WITH WHICH WHEN THEY ARE FILLED AND THE ACRIMONY BE COMES TROUBLESOME THEY CONTRACT THEMSELVES TO EXPEL IT659 IT BUT IT BEING CONFINED FOR SOME TIME FOR REASONS ALLEDGED DOES NECESSARILY PUT THEM UPON REPEATED CON TRACTIONS IN WHICH HE PLACES THE NATURE OF THE RIGOR TILL THEY AT LAST EXPEL IT INTO THE MASS OF BLOOD AMONGST WHOSE VERY HETEROGENEOUS PARTICLES MANY OF WHICH TOO ARE SULPHUROUS IT MAKES A GREAT COMMOTION WHICH CANNOT CEASE TILL BOTH THE PARTICLES OF THIS FERMENT AND THE DISTURBED ONES OF THE BLOOD ARE SUBDUED AND REDUCED INTO ORDER OR EXPELLED BUT THIS ATONY OF THE GLANDULES OF THE BRAIN CONTINUING NAY IN SOME MEASURE INCREASED BY THE DISEASE THE FOREMENTIONED ADMISSION OF MORE HETEROGENEOUS MATTER MUST BE REPEATED AS IN THE SAME ORDER THE MATURATION ERUPTION INTO ACT AND EXTRASION OF IT WITH THE ALLEDGED CONSEQUENTS AND THAT SO OFTEN TILL EITHER BY MEDICINES OR THE CHANGE OF SEASON OR OTHER CAUSES THESE GLANDULES COME TO RECO VER THEIR PRISTINE FORCE THIS HYPOTHESIS HE ENDEAVOURS TO CONFIRM FROM SOME OBVIOUS GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THEN PROCEEDS FIRST TO ENUMERATE IN THEIR ORDER OF INVASION THE SYMPTOMS WHICH MOST USUALLY OFFER THEMSELVES AND THEN TO SOLVE THEM FROM HIS HYPOTHESIS THIS DONE HE CONSIDERS THE TYPES WHICH NOT HAVING BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR TO HIS SATISFACTION BY FORMER AUTHORS HE TAKES HIMSELF TO BE OBLIGED TO TRY WHETHER THEY CAN BE FROM HIS HYPOTHESIS AND THEREFORE OFFERS A NEW ONE ABOUT THEM TO CONSIDERATION THEREFORE IN THE FIRST PLACE HE CONSIDERS THAT THE THREE SORTS OF REGULAR AND USUAL TYPES QUOTIDIAN TERTIAN AND QUARTAN DO GENERALLY OBSERVE CERTAIN DETERMINATE SEASONS OF THE YEAR AND NOT FREQUENTLY HAPPEN AT O THERS VIZ QUOTIDIANS IN THE WINTER TERTIANS IN THE SPRING AND QUARTANS IN THE AUTUMN BUT THAT RARELY INTERMITTENTS BEGIN IN THE SUMMER IN THE SEVERAL CON STITUTIONS OF THESE SEASONS HE SUPPOSES OUR BLOOD AND OTHER JUICES OBTAIN LIKEWISE DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONS WHICH HE M EXPLAINS660 EXPLAINS SO THAT THERE MUST IN GENERAL BE A DIFFERENCE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF DISEASES THOUGH OF THE SAME DE NOMINATION WHICH HAPPEN IN EITHER OF THEM BUT TO SIGN A REASON WHY WE HAVE PERIODICAL RETURNSHE CONSIDERS FIRST THAT WE GENERALLY EAT AT DETERMINATE TIMES FROM WHENCE THE ADMISSION AS WELL AS DISTRIBUTION OF THE NUTRITIOUS JUICE WHICH HE BEFORE SUPPOSED TO BE BY THE NERVES MUST BE PERIODICAL BUT THIS BEING NOT SUFFICI ENT SINCE MOST PERSONS EAT OFTNER THAN ONCE A DAY HE CONSIDERS SECONDLY THAT WE SLEEP ORDINARILY BUT ONCE IN 24 HOURS AT WHICH TIME THE BRAIN BEING RELAXED ADMITS THE SUPPLIMENTS OF NOURISHMENT FOR THE NEXT DAY AS UP ON WAKING IT BEGINS AND ALL DAY AFTER CONTINUES GENTLY TO PROTRUDE IT AT LEAST MORE VIGOROUSLY THROUGH THE WHOLE FIBROUS SYSTEME IN WHICH TIME IT ADVANCES IN ITS MATU RATION AS USUALLY TOWARD BECOMING A FIT NUTRITIOUS JUYCE SO NOW BEING IN SOME DEGREE INCONGRUOUS TO WARD A FEBRIFICK FERMENT SO THAT CAETERIS PARIBUS A DI ARY PERIOD UNLESS WHEN A GREATER OR MORE DEPRAVED QUANTITY THAN USUAL OF HETEROGENEOUS MATTER ABOUNDS MAY BE HENCE EXPECTED BUT TO DETERMINE THE REASON OF LON GER PERIODS HE SUPPOSES THIRDLY WE MUST HAVE RECOURSE TO THE DIFFERENT CONSTITUTIONS OF THE YEAR AND IN THE SPRING THE AIR ABOUNDING BY GENERAL CONSENT WITH NI TROUS PARTICLES WHICH THOUGH ACTIVE AND THENCE APT TO EXAGITATE AND EXALT A  FERMENT YET HELPING TO CONSTITUTE THE PRINCIPLES OF VITALITY AND IN SOME DEGREE CORROBORATIVE OF THE TONE OF THE GLANDULES THEY HINDER IN SOME MEASURE THE ENCREASE OF THE MORBID MATTER IN THEM SO THAT SO MUCH CANNOT BE CONGESTED IN THE SYSTEME OF THE NERVES AND FIBRES AS TO RISE TO A DEGREE OF VELLICA TION ABLE TO PRODUCE A PAROXYSME WHENCE THERE IS A NE CESSITY OF A SECOND NIGHTS SUPPLIES TO YIELD A PROPORTIO NABLE QUANTITY TO THE EFFECT BUT IN THE AUTUMN ACIDS ABOUNDING WHICH BOTH IN SOME DEGREE REPRESS FERMEN TATION AND WITHAL HELP TO CONSTRINGE THE TONE OF THE PARTS661 PARTS THE CONGESTION CANNOT BE MADE SO SUDDENLY AS IN OTHER SEASONS AND THEREFORE SINCE THE ADMISSION OF THE MATTER IS HAD IN SLEEP ENOUGH CANNOT BE TAKEN IN UN DER A SECOND NIGHTS INTERVAL TO SUPPLY ENOUGH FOR A TUR GESCENCE WHICH THE NATURE OF THE MATTER IN SOME MEA SURE HINDERS FROM RISING UP TO IT THE LONGER PERIODS HE SUPPOSES ARE DEDUCIBLE FROM A GREATER DISPOFITION TO ACIDITY IN THE NERVOUS JUICE AND THAT THE SEAT OF THE DISTEMPER IS THERE THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SYMPTOMS WHOLLY OR CHIEFLY AFFECTING THE NERVOSUM GENUS IN THOSE LONGER PERIODS SO FAR AS HE HAS OBSERVED SEEM TO HIM A COGENT ARGUMENT AS TO THE ANOMALIES OF THEM HE SUPPOSES THEM IN THE FOURTH PLACE DEDUCIBLE PARTLY FROM THE VARIETY OF THE CONSTITUTIONS OF PARTICULAR PERSONS PARTLY FROM PAR TICULAR CHANGES OF THE AIR ALIMENTS C AND FROM EX TERNAL OCCASIONS WHICH CANNOT BE ENUMERATED THEN HE COMES TO CONSIDER THE METHOD OF CURE AND SINCE SEVERAL ADMINISTRATIONS ARE NECESSARY SOME AT ONE TIME OF THE DISTEMPER SOME AT ANOTHER AND SOME FOR SOME PERSONS SOME FOR OTHERS ACCORDING TO VARIOUS CIR CUMSTANCES HE GOES THROUGH THEM AND ENDEAVOURS TO RENDER AN ACCOUNT IN GENERAL ON WHAT SCORE PLEBOTOMY VOMITS PURGERS DIAPHORETICKS DIURETICKS ALTERING ME DICINES AS DIGESTIVES SPECIFICKS OPIATS AND PERICARPIA PRODUCE THEIR EFFECTS WHEN TIS PROPER IN THEIR TURNS TO USE THEM AFTER WHICH HE DELIVERS A SUFFICIENT ACCOUNT OF THE PARTICULAR METHODS WHICH HE CONCEIVES PROPER FOR EACH OF THE THREE SORTS OF INTERMITTING FEVERS BUT SINCE THE CORTEX PERUVIANUS IS BECOME SO CELEBRA TED AS WELL AS IT IS AN EFFECTUAL REMEDY FOR THEM ALL HE IN AN ENTIRE CHAPTER OFFERS AN AETIOLOGY OF IT AGREEABLY TO THE HYPOTHESIS HE HAS LAID DOWN OF THEIR SOURCE AND FROM MECHANICAL PRINCIPLES TO FORM WHICH HE 1CT ENUMERATES SEVERAL OBSERVABLES RELATING TO ITS KNOWN EF FECTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF ITS EXHIBITION 2LY HE CON SIDERS662 SIDERS THE TEXTURE OF IT WHICH HE TAKES TO BE VERY COMPACT AND NOT QUICKLY DISSOLUBLE BY THE FERMENTS TIS NOW TO MEET WITH 3LY HE ENQUIRES INTO THE SCENE OF ITS OPERATION WHERE HE TRACES IT THROUGH THE WAYS OF THE CHYLE THOSE OF THE BLOOD THE HABIT OF THE BODYAND THE SYSTEMA NERVORUMAND THINKING FOR THE REA SONS HE ALLEDGES TIS NOT TO BE FOUND ADEQUATELY TO THE EFFECT IN THE THREE FORMER HE PLACES IT IN THE LAST AND ENDEAVOURS TO MAKE IT OUT FROM SEVERAL DEDUCTIONS 4LY HE DESCRIHES IN A MECHANICAL WAY THE MANNER OF ITS ACTION SUPPOSING THAT SOME OF ITS PARTICLES HAVING UNDERGONE SEVERAL COMMINUTIONS THO NOT A DISSOLUTION FROM THE VARIOUS FIRMENTS THEY HAVE PASSED ARRIVE AT LAST WITH THE BLOOD AT THE BRAIN AND BEING WITH SOME OF ITS VEHICLE SEPARATED THERE FROM THE GROSSER PARTS OF BOTH IN THE CORTICAL GLANDULES THEY ARE ADMITTED INTO THE TUBULATED ROOTS OF THE NERVEOUS TREE BY THE WAY THAT THE NU TRITIOUS JUYCE IS SUPPLIED INTO WHICH THOSE OF THEM WHICH ARE NOT SMALL ENOUGH TO PASS THOSE STRAITS ALONG WITH THE JUICEBEING JUST ADMITTED STICK THERE TILL OTHER APPELLING SUBSTANCES GIVE THEM A FARTHER COMMINUTION AND SO PRETRUDE THEM ALONG BUT ON THE SCORE OF THEIR IRREGULAR SIDES HE SUPPOSES THEY LEAVE 100M INDEED BETWEEN THEM AND THE SIDES OF THOSE ROUND VESSELS FOR THE FINER JUICE TO PASS BUT PRECLUDE THE ENTRANCE TO THE GROSSER WHICH HE HAS SUPPOSED IS THE MATTER THAT MAKES THE FEBRILE FERMENT AND THEREBY PROVE NO WAY IN JURIOUS TO THE ANIMAL FUNCTIONS SINCE ENOUGH AND THAT THE PU REST MAY PASS BY THEM TO ACTUATE THE NERVES WHILST THESE PAR TICLES STICK HERE HE CONCEIVES THAT BY SOFTLY CANCINATING THE IN CLUDING COATS WITH THEIR ANGLES THEY MAY CAUSE THEM TO CON TRACT THEMSELVES TO THEIR DUE TONE AND THEY CRUMBLING BY DE GREES AS THAT IS DOING LEAVE THE PART IN ITS NATURAL ESTATE AND SO WITHOUT A FRESH CAUSE THE DISTEMPER CEASES 5LY HE ENDEA VOURS TO SHEW THAT ALL THE MENTIONED OBSERVABLES AGREE TO HIS HYPOTHESIS LASTLY TO ACCOMODATE THESE SPECULATIONS TO PRA CTICE HE LAYS DOWN BRIEFLY THE METHOD TO BE OBSERVED IN RELA TION TO THE GIVING IT THINKING WITHAL IT MAY BE USEFUL IN MOST CHRONICAL PERIODICAL DISTEMPERS AND CONCLUDES WITH A COUPLE OF HISTORIES TO CONFIRM HIS NOTION OF THE SEAT OF THE DISTEM PER AND THE SCENE OF THE OPERATION OF THE CORTEX HIS SUBJOINED DISCOURSE CONCERNING THE SPIRAL FIBRES OF THE INTESTINES HAVING BEEN MANY YEARS SINCE PUBLISHED IN ENGLISH IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS HE NOW AT THE IMPORTUNITY OF SOME FRIENDS HAS THOUGHT FIT TO PUBLISH IN LATINE L O N D O N PRINTED FOR AND SOLD BY SAMUEL SMITH PRINTER TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AT THE PRINCES ARMS IN ST PAULS CHURCHYARD 1693

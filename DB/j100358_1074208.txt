education it is undeni able that less is still accomplished than might be accomplished with the same expenditure of time and effort In other words there is still waste in highschool education Four aspects or modes of waste may be distinguished I method or manner of teaching 2 matter 3 order of pres entation 4 aim or purpose The waste in method of instruction is the most obvious and widely discussed yet every teacher knows that it is still widely prevalent Some teachers use too many books others too few Some make too much use of the memory others too little Some talk too seldom themselves others talk altogether too much Time would fail for even an enumeration of the defects in instruction leading to waste in education But there is one point seldom mentioned which nevertheless in my opinion deserves special attention I refer to the radical difference in method between the eighth and ninth grades Up to that point the methods change but little and slowly in the main not at all The pupil studies and recites all his lessons in one room to one teacher with the same surroundings and the same classmates The school therefore becomes a second home and the intimate personal contact results in direct and fruitful influence of person ality upon personality But the moment he enters the high school all is changed and the larger the school the greater is the change The pupil is now lost in the multitude He stud ies in a room whose occupants are constantly changing he recites to four or five teachers whom he scarcely sees except in class he goes from room to room finding in each a multitude of new faces in all this busy hurrying throng of pupils and teach ers there is seldom anyone to whom he feels free to unbosom A paper read before the Minnesota Educational Association 422WASTE IN HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION himself anyone who has a vital personal interest in him and to whom he feels a direct personal reponsibility In a word he is thrown entirely upon his own resources without a word of warning or of preparation Is it any wonder that the percentage of mortality so to speak in the first year of high school is alarmingly great  That boy spoke better than he knew who on being asked why he did not get along better in high school replied that he couldnt get the hang of the schoolhouse Could anything more pathetic be imagined  A system which through the lack of adjustment between grammar school and high school gives rise to such a condition of affairs is assuredly a prolific source of educational waste Matter and order of study together constitute the question of course of study which has of late years been the subject of such extended and fruitful discussion Here again time would be lacking merely to name the ways in which waste occurs through the irrational choice of subjects and the illogical and unpedagogical order of treatment Almost any course of study even the best would offer examples to the point Hitherto one of the chief causes of this condition has been the fearful and wonderful variety of entrance requirements which the colleges have maintained and sought to impose on the schools To all appearances it has been a race between them to see which could invent the most impossible set of requirements the winner in this contest being esteemed the most advanced and exclusive institution But the agitation for uniform college entrance requirements is proof that the greatness of the resulting evil is working its own cure and the high schools may now hope for the gradual removal of the obstructions which the colleges have offered to the formation of a rational highschool curriculum The University of Minnesota is to be congratulated on having taken in the recent revision of its requirements the longest step in this direction which has yet been made by any American university excepting only Harvard In at least one respect however I believe there is still room for improvement I am one of those who believe that the retention as an absolute requirement of the socalled higher algebra which in practice 423THE SCHOOL REVIEW is very seldom anything of the sort costs a great deal more in derangement of the curriculum than it is worth But the main responsibility for the waste resulting from unwise choice of matter and order must nevertheless be borne by the high schools Comforting as it would be it cannot be shifted to the colleges The force of tradition is mighty human inertia is great it is so much easier to copy thought lessly some previous course with trifling changes in details to suit local conditions or individual fancy than to make a new course on some rational plan And the confusion always result ing where some rank educational empiric has illustrated anew the ancient proverb about fools and angels has tended to con firm the majority in the conviction that the beaten track is the way of safety Thus conditions have on the whole changed very slowly and not always for the better When high schools were first established there was one course for all alike to this bed of Procrustes all must be fitted at whatever sacrifice of their natural abilities Later the pendulum swung to the other extreme and courses multiplied until it seemed that high schools prided themselves as much on the number and peculiarity of their courses as the colleges on their entrance requirements In both cases the pride felt in such matters appeared to vary in inverse ratio to the size of the school Instances have been known of a school of less than two hundred pupils maintaining from six to twenty different courses and it is believed that such schools still exist though of course not in Minnesota The waste resulting from such an arrangement is only less if indeed it be lessthan that resulting from the single ironclad course Of all the forms of educational waste all teachers will surely agree that the most harassing and hopeless is that of try ing to pound subjects into the heads of pupils who can never in this world be brought to comprehend them Is it not so Yet wherein does the multiple course system offer any relief The true remedy is not optional courses but optional studies The introduction of a single general course with a few studies required and the rest optional may in my opinion be justified on the following grounds 424WASTE IN HIGHSCHOOL EDUCATION I That an appeal to the assumed ability of school authori ties to choose more wisely than the pupils logically requires the establishment of a single ironclad course for all pupils an obvi ous reductio ad absurdum 2 That the establishment of several inflexible courses between which pupils are to choose once for all abandons com pletely the theory of benevolent despotism and substitutes the optional principle in its most injurious and indefensible form in that namely in which the youth of the pupil and the irrevocable nature of the dicision combine to produce the maximum number of fatal mistakes and consequently of ruined careers 3 That the attempt to escape these consequences by allow ing a change of course and the substitution of studies as now generally practiced leads to a condition of utter chaos and that this result cannot be avoided so long as the valueinexchange of the several studies and the selection of those which are indispensable depend upon nothing more permanent or tan gible than the private opinion of the temporary principal 4 That the only way of insuring that each graduate and each pupil so far as he goes shall have taken a consistent well rounded course is therefore to authorize and at the same time to limit the substitution of studies on a definite credit basis in such a manner that whatever choice the pupil makes he cannot construct for himself a scrappy unrelated course Finally it is obvious that both the manner and matter of education are largely determined by the aim and in the pre dominant aim of education today is involved a waste greater than all the other aspects combined The schools the last ref uge of discredited philosophies are still dominated by the extreme individualism of the last century which regarded the individual as the center of the universe and the object and end of creation This philosophy has been weighed in the balance and found wanting long years ago in all other departments of thought In economics and politics the laissez faire theory has long since passed to the limbo of doctrinaire inventions Depravity in the home dishonesty in business corruption in politics are all a most impressive warning that the individual 425THE SCHOOL REVIEW has been petted and pampered until he feels no sense of obliga tion to God or man Public spirited citizens are moved to form civic leagues to combat the reign of unbridled selfishness And yet in the face of all this the schools go on educating youth with a view not to the good of society but to the advantage of the individual Schools cannot be rightfully maintained out of public taxation merely to give an additional start in life to those already endowed by nature with exceptional advantages We need to hear less of the rights of the individual and more of his duties less of individual liberty and more of social solidarity As Fouillee has pointed out The danger that above all others a democratic nation must avoid is the disintegration of society into units with no immediate concern but selfinterest into individuals to whom social duties and bonds are gradually ceasing to appeal Aris totle assures us that man is by nature a social animal  and a greater than Aristotle has taught that we are all members one of another and that none of us liveth unto himself  shall we not at last cease to go contrary to this primary truth in our edu cation  If this most fundamental and disastrous waste in edu cation is to end there must be more emphasis on the social sciences throughout the schools and especially in the high school an emphasis which shall appear not only nor chiefly in the introduction of new subjects but in the handling of all sub jects with reference to their bearing on social welfare The imperative need of the age is the socialization of education EDWARD VAN DYKE

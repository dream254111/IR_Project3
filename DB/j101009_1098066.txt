AS TO THE HEIRS AND HEIRS OF THE BODY IT WOULD SEEM CLEAR THAT BY THE DEFINITION OF A VESTED REMAIN DER ABOVE GIVEN THE REMAINDER TO THEM IS CONTINGENT AND CANNOT VEST IN THEM UNTIL THEY ARE ASCERTAINED BY THE DEATH OF THE ANCESTOR AND SEE THIS VIEW TAKEN BY GRAY RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES SEC 107 AND BY TIEDEMAN REAL PROP SEC 433 N 1 ON P 346 BUT IN MOORE V LITTELL 41 N Y 66 IT WAS HELD THAT SINCE THE ABROGATION OF THE RULE IN SHELLEYS CASE A GRANT TO A FOR LIFE AND AFTER HIS DECEASE TO HIS HEIRS AND THEIR ASSIGNS FOREVER GAVE TO THE CHILDREN OF A A VESTED INTEREST IN THE LAND THOUGH LIABLE TO OPEN AND LET IN AFTERBORN CHILDREN OF A AND LIABLE ALSO IN RESPECT TO THE INTEREST OF ANY CHILD TO BE WHOLLY DEFEATED BY HIS DEATH BEFORE HIS FATHER THUS TREATING THE CONDITION OF SURVIVORSHIP AS SUBSEQUENT INSTEAD OF PRECEDENT FROM THIS CONCLUSION THREE OF THE JUSTICES DISSENTED AND IF TENABLE IT MUST BE BY REASON OF THE STATUTORY DEFINITION OF REMAINDERS IN NEW YORK ASSUMING IT TO CHANGE THE DOCTRINE OF THE COMMON LAW AND ON THE SUPPOSI TION THAT THERE WAS NO GROUND OF FORFEITURE BY WHICH AS ESTATE MIGHT END IN HIS LIFETIME BY THE NEW YORK REVISED STATUTES UNDER WHICH MOORE V LITTELL WAS DECIDED IT IS DECLARED FUTURE ESTATES ARE EITHER VESTED OR CONTINGENT THEY ARE VESTED WHEN THERE IS A PERSON IN BEING WHO WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE RIGHT TO THE POSSES SION OF THE

THIS STATUTE PROFESSOR GRAY SAYS RULE AGAINST PERPETUITIES SEC 107 IT IS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATIVE DEFINITION WAS INTENDED TO CHANGE THE COMMON LAW BUT THE COURTS OF NEW YORK HAVE DECIDED AND IT WOULD SEEM CORRECTLY THAT IT HAS DONE SO AND IT WOULD SEEM THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS VIEW NECESSITATES THE DECISIONS OF THE COURT OF APPEALS WHICH AT FIRST APPEAR RATHER STARTLING THAT SINCE THE ABOLITION OF THE RULE IN SHELLEYS CASE A REMAINDER TO HEIRS AFTER A LIFE ESTATE TO THE ANCESTOR IS VESTED ON THE OTHER HAND PROFESSOR TIEDEMAN REAL PROP SEC 433 NOTE 1 SAYS THIS REMARKABLE DECISION IS ALTOGETHER INCONSISTENT WITH THE RULES OF THE LAW OF REMAINDERS AND EVEN WITH THE NEW YORK STATUTORY DEFINITION OF A CONTIN GENT REMAINDER VIZ THAT THEY ARE CONTINGENT  WHILST THE PERSON TO WHOM OR THE EVENT UPON WHICH THEY ARE LIMITED TO TAKE EFFECT REMAINS UNCERTAIN IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT THE VIRGINIA CODE OF 1849 CH 116 SEC 11 IN ABOLISH ING THE RULE IN SHELLEYS CASE DECLARED THE CONVEYANCE SHALL BE CONSTRUED TO VEST AN ESTATE FOR LIFE ONLY IN SUCH PERSON AND A REMAINDER IN FEE SIMPLE IN HIS HEIRS OR THE HEIRS OF HIS BODY AND UPON THE WORD  VEST IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT THAT THE STATUTE NEGATIVED A CONTINGENT REMAINDER BUT THE CODE OF 1887 SEC 2423 DE CLARES THAT THE WORDS HEIRS HEIRS OF THE BODY OR ISSUE SHALL BE CONSTRUED AS WORDS OF PURCHASE CREATING A REMAINDER IN THE

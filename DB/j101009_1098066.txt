purchase it means prima facie legi timate children only and bastards are excluded And this construction will be adhered to unless from the context of the will or the circumstances of the case as when there are only illegitimate children it is manifest that it would defeat the intention of the testator Hill v Crook L R 6 H L 265 Eagleton v Horner 37 Ch D 695 In Goods of Ashton 1892 p 83 Hawkins Wills 80 2 Jarman Wills 786 And the doctrine is the same in the United States gen erally 5 Am  Eng Ency Law 1096 But in Virginia it is held in Bennett v Toler 15 Gratt 588 that upon a devise to a daughter for life and at her death the property to be equally divided among her children an illegitimate child of the daughter will take with her legitimate children But this decision is placed on the ground that the Virginia law of descents declaring that bastards shall be capable of inheriting and transmitting inheritance on the part of their mother as if lawfully begotten Code sec 2552 has changed the general rule by giv ing the bastard a mother and making him one of her children and as he is capable of taking by descent as her child he is also embraced under a will by the words her children The court says p 631 And so adhering to the principle of the rule where the law makes the bastard child of a woman her child endows him with every attribute of a child born in wedlock includes him in the very class designated as children to whom her estate is to pass in the event of her dying intestate a testator speaking of her children the words must be con strued to include in the class all who in law are her children Moncure J dissented 2 Afterborn Children Whether when there is a devise to children as pur chasers those born after the death of the testator are entitled to take as embraced in the class depends upon whether the gift to the children is immediate or post poned Thus if the gift be immediate as if there be a devise to A and his chil dren and A has children at the death of the testator and others are born subse quently only the children in being at his death including a child en ventre sa mere are entitled and afterborn children are excluded But this construction is prima facie only and will yield to the intention and it is rebutted if the testa tor devises To A and his children born or to be born Woodruff v Pleasants 81 Va 37 or uses any expressions from which the intent to include afterborn children can be inferred See Buford v Land Co 90 Va 418 a case of a deed 2 Devlin Deeds sec 864 But on the other hand if the gift to the children be post poned as when the devise is To A for life and after his death to the children of B then the rule is that the word children includes any child born before the termination of the life estate of A although not in being at the death of the testa tor Here the remainder vests at once in the children living at the death of the testator but will open and let in all children of B born after that time but before the death of A Hamletts v IHamlett 12 Leigh 350 Cooper v Hlepburn 15 Gratt 551 But any children of B born after As death will be excluded And in this case the words born or to be born applied to the children of A will not alter 624 Janthe construction because these words are taken to refer to children born between the death of the testator and the death of A See 2 Jarman Wills 700742 Hawkins Wills 6880 29 Am  Eng Ency Law 410414 And the rule as to the time at which the number of objects is to be ascertained is the same as to all classes of relations brothers nephews cousins etc including issue when it is a word of purchase 2 Jarman Wills 703 Hawkins Wills 72 In the above statement of the law as to immediate and future gifts to children it has been assumed that there were one or more children living at the death of the testator or at the death of the life tenant But as to immediate gifts it there be no child in esse at the death of the testator the gift will embrace all the chil dren who may be born afterwards by way of executory bequest or devise And the same rule is applicable to a future gift when not subject to the common law rule as to the time of vesting of contingent remainders 2 Jarman Wills 721 725 See Code Va sec 2424 C A G VESTED AND CONTINGENT REMAINDERSA remainder is vested when it is subject to no condition precedent and is always ready during its continuance to come into the possession of a certain person already existing and ascertained on the determination of the particular estate now or hereafter in any manner what soever And any remainder not so ready is contingent See in substantial accord with the above definition of a vested remainder 20 Am  Eng Ency Law 838 Gray Rule against Perpetuities sees 101108 2 Minors Inst 4th ed 396 It will be observed that the definition requires that the remainderman at the time the question arises should already be in existence and ascertained and it is not enough in order to consider the remainder now vested that he will become ascertained at the moment the particular estate ends and the possession becomes vacant Thus there are cases where the same event that ends the particular estate ascertains the remainderman and whenever the possession becomes vacant there will then be a certain person ready to take posses sion as in the limitation To A for the life of B remainder to the heirs of B or To A and B for life remainder to the survivor and his heirs Here the remain der will vest and come into possession eo instanti on the death of B in the one case or the survivorship of A or B in the other but meanwhile it remains con tingent because as yet there is no determinate person in whom the estate is invariably fixed for nemo est hceres viventis and who can now tell whether A or B will be the survivor  A test suggested by Prof J Randolph Tucker will clearly show that these remainders are contingent viz Is the remainderman a person to whom you could give livery of seisin now if his estate were present and not fu ture How could livery be made to the heirs of B while B is living or to the survivor of A and B while both are alive And see Tiedeman Real Prop sec 397 note 2 where it is said that a reliable test of a vested remainder is the present capacity of the grantor to convey an absolute title to the remainder man See Chapman v Chapman 90 Va 410 For the reasons above stated Fearnes test of a vested remainder viz The present capacity of taking effect in possession if the possession were to become vacant Fearne 216 is open to exception in omitting to add after taking effect in possession the words of an already existing and ascertained person but the whole tenor of his discussion of remainders shows that this was intended 1899 625 MISCCELLANYVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER And the same criticism may be made on the definition of Williams though it is believed to be a verbal inaccuracy only If any estate be it ever so small is always ready from its commencement to its end to come into possession the mo ment the prior estates be they what they may happeA to determine it is then a vested remainder meaning no doubt  ready to come into the possession of a person already in existence and ascertained Wms R P 17th ed 397 But see Oroxall v Shererd 5 Wall 268 Kumpe v Coons 63 Ala 448 Smith v West 103 Ill 332 In 20 Am  Eng Ency Law 1st ed p 841 the importance of adding to the definition of a vested remainder the requisite that at the time of inquiry the remainderman shall be already in existence and ascertained is thus stated The fact that the remainder from the very instant of its creation is capable of taking effect in possession or enjoyment at any moment the possession or enjoyment may become vacant by the determination of the particular estate does not as is fre quently asserted necessarily show that it is vested nor yet is it quite accurate to say that when it is certain that the remainder may take effect in possession on the determination of the preceding estates of freehold at whatever time and how ever early and by whatever means these estates may determine 1 Preston Es tates 79 the remainder must be considered as vested Thus if an estate be limited to two for life remainder to the survivor of them in fee the remainder is contingent for until one of them die it is uncertain which will be the survivor Fearne Cont Rem 9 or if land be limited to A for life remainder to such of his children as shall be living at his decease each child has but a contingent remainder during As life since until his death it is impossible to tell which of the children will answer the description and yet inasmuch as under both these limitations the person or persons who are to take are ascertained immediately on the determination of the particular estate the remainders may well be said to be capable of taking effect in possession or enjoyment at any moment the possession or enjoyment may become vaeant by the death of the life tenant and may even be said to be certain to take effect on that event unless the remainderman pre decease the life tenant In 20 Am  Eng Ency Law p 840 this definition is given of a contingent remainder A remainder is contingent when it is so limited as to take effect to a person not in esse or not ascertained or upon an event which may never happen or may not happen until after the determination of the particular estate It should be borne in mind however that the courts favor the vesting of estates and will not hold remainders to be contingent if it is possible to consider them as vested And for this reason as is said by Tiedeman Real Prop sec 401 note 2  Very often a remainder will be construed to be a vested estate upon a condition subse quent liable to be divested by the happening of the contingency rather than de clare it to be a contingent remainder as it would be if the condition were prece dent See Gray Rule against Perpetuities secs 102106 also Moore v Littell 41 N Y 66 Kelso v Lorillard 85 N Y 177 Avery v Everett 110 N Y 317 Thaw v Ritchie 136 U S 519 For cases in which the court was called on to decide as to the character of a re mainder whether vested or contingent see Wallace v Mlinor 86 Va 550 qucere as to the Rule in Shelleys Case Gish v Moomaw 89 Va 345 Robinson v Rob inson lb 916 Chapman v Chapman 90 Va 409 Crews v Iatcher 91 Va 378 626 JanWilson v White 109 N Y 59 McArthur v Scott 113 U S 340 378 Miller v Texas etc R Co 132 U S 662 Thaw v Ritchie 136 U S 519 In re Deightons Settled Estates 2 Ch D 783 Ounliffe v Brancker 3 Ch D 393 The question arises under the statutes abolishing the rule in Shelleys Case as to the nature of the remainder whether vested or contingent which is created by the statute in the heirs heirs of the body or issue as purchasers As to the heirs and heirs of the body it would seem clear that by the definition of a vested remain der above given the remainder to them is contingent and cannot vest in them until they are ascertained by the death of the ancestor And see this view taken by Gray Rule against Perpetuities sec 107 and by Tiedeman Real Prop sec 433 n 1 on p 346 But in Moore v Littell 41 N Y 66 it was held that since the abrogation of the rule in Shelleys Case a grant To A for life and after his decease to his heirs and their assigns forever gave to the children of A a vested interest in the land though liable to open and let in afterborn children of A and liable also in respect to the interest of any child to be wholly defeated by his death before his father thus treating the condition of survivorship as subsequent instead of precedent From this conclusion three of the justices dissented and if tenable it must be by reason of the statutory definition of remainders in New York assuming it to change the doctrine of the common law and on the supposi tion that there was no ground of forfeiture by which As estate might end in his lifetime By the New York revised statutes under which Moore v Littell was decided it is declared Future estates are either vested or contingent They are vested when there is a person in being who would have an immediate right to the posses sion of the lands upon the ceasing of the intermediate or precedent estate They are contingent whilst the person to whom or the event upon which they are limited to take effect remains uncertain Commenting on this statute Professor Gray says Rule against Perpetuities sec 107 It is doubtful whether this piece of legislative definition was intended to change the common law but the courts of New York have decided and it would seem correctly that it has done so And it would seem that the adoption of this view necessitates the decisions of the Court of Appeals which at first appear rather startling that since the abolition of the rule in Shelleys Case a remainder to heirs after a life estate to the ancestor is vested On the other hand Professor Tiedeman Real Prop sec 433 note 1 says This remarkable decision is altogether inconsistent with the rules of the law of remainders and even with the New York statutory definition of a contin gent remainder viz that they are contingent  whilst the person to whom or the event upon which they are limited to take effect remains uncertain It may be observed that the Virginia Code of 1849 ch 116 sec 11 in abolish ing the rule in Shelleys Case declared the conveyance shall be construed to vest an estate for life only in such person and a remainder in fee simple in his heirs or the heirs of his body and upon the word  vest it has been thought that the statute negatived a contingent remainder But the Code of 1887 sec 2423 de clares that the words heirs heirs of the body or issue shall be construed as words of purchase creating a remainder in the heirs heirs of the body or issue As to the remainder to the  issue the view is taken in 2 Minors Inst 4th ed 463 that when issue is a word of purchase it is equivalent to heirs of the body and that as no one can be heir to a living person a remainder to the issue of A is 1899 627 MISCELLANY628 VIRGTNIA LAW REGISTER Jan for that reason contingent until the death of A But the question there under consideration was the effect in Virginia since July 1 1850 of the limitation To A for life and if he die without issue to B in which the implied remainder in favor of the issue of A is made contingent by the statute of 1820 by which the implication is confined to issue living at the time of his death or born to him within ten months thereafter See Va Law Journal April 1880 article en titled Dying without Issue under Virginia Statutes And it is believed that the maxim nemo est hceres viventis has no application to the word issue and that an estate can vest in the issue of a living person unless the language of the will shows a contrary intention It may also be remarked that issue living at the death of a person may include a much iarger class of objects than heirs of the body Issue when a word limitation is equivalent to heirs of the body but not when it is word of pure e 2 Jarm Wills 5th Am ed chaps 28 and 29 2 Redfield Wills part 2 ch 1 Ha kins on Wills 2d Am ed 87 191 197 11 Am and

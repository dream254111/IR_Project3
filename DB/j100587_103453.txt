ROOTS,I206899,104 IV A LETTER FROM MR COLIN MAC LAURIN PROFES SOR OF MATHEMATICKS AT EDINBURGH AND FRS TO MARTIN FOLKES ESQ V PR R S CONCER NING AEQUATIONS WITH IMPOSSIBLE ROOTS S I R I WROTE TO YOU LAST WINTER THAT I HAD THOUGHT OF A VERY EASIE AND SIMPLE WAY OF DEMONSTRATING SIR ISAAC NEWTONS RULE BY WHICH IT MAY BE OFTEN DISCO VERD WHEN AN AEQUATION HAS IMPOSSIBLE ROOTS THIS METHOD REQUIRING NOTHING BUT THE COMMON ALGEBRA AND BEING FOUNDED ON SOME OBVIOUS PROPERTIES OF QUANTITIES DEMONSTRATED IN THE FOLLOWING LEMMATA WITHOUT HAVING RECOURSE TO THE CONSIDERATION OF ANY CURVE WHATSOEVER WHICH DOES NOT SEEM SO PROPER A METHOD IN A MATTER PURELY ALGEBRAICAL I HOPE IT WILL NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE LEMMA 1 THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF TWO REAL QUANTITIES IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN TWICE THEIR PRODUCT THUS A2B2 IS GREATER THAN 2 A B BECAUSE THE EXCESS A2B22 A B IS EQAAL TO 2 AB AND THEREFORE IS POSITIVE SINCE THE SQUARE OF ANY REAL QUANTITY NEGATIVE OR PO SITIVE IS ALWAYS POSITIVE LEMMA 2 THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THREE REAL QUANTITIES IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PRO DUCTSTHAT CAN BE MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THEM THUS A2B2C2 IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN A BA CB C FOR TIS PLAIN THAT THE EXCESS A2B2C2A BA CB C 105  2 A22B22 C22 A B A C2 B C2  A2  2 A BB2A2  A CC2B22  2 B CC2  2 A  B 2 AC  2 BC2 THAT IS HALF THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THE DIFFERENCES OF THE QUANTITIES A B C BUT SINCE THESE SQUARES ARE POSITIVE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE EXCESS OF A2  B2  C2 ABOVE A BA CB C IS POSITIVE AND THAT THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THREE QUANTITIES MUST BE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THEM LEMMA 3 THE TRIPLE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF FOUR QUANTITIES IS GREATER THAN THE DOUBLE SUM OF THE PRO DUCTSTHAT CAN BE MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THEM FOR 3 A2  3 B2  3 C2  3 D2  2 A B  2 A C  2 A D  2 BC  2 B D  2 C D  A2  2 A B  B2  A2  2 A C  C2  A2  2 A D  D2  B2  2 B D  D2  B2  2 B C  C2  C2  2 C D  D2  2 A  D  2 AC  2 AD  2 BC  2 BD   CD2 THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THE DIFFERENCES OF THE FOUR QUANTITIES A B C D THEREFORE 3 A2  3 B2  3 C2  3 D2 IS GREATER THAN 2 A B  2 A C  2 A D  2 B C  2 B D  2 C D THE EXCESS BEING ALWAYS POSITIVE LEMMA 4 LET THE NUMBER OF THE QUANTITIES A B C D E C BE M THE SUM OF THEIR SQUARES A AND THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THEM B THEN SHALL  M    A2 BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN B FOR BY ADDING TOGETHER THE SQUARES OF THE DIFFEREN CES AB AC AD BC BD CD C YOU ADD A2 AS OFTEN TO IT SELF AS THERE ARE QUANTITIES MORE THAN A THE SAME IS TRUE OF B2 C2 D2 E2 C BUT THE RECTAN GLES 2 A B 2 A C 2 A D 2 B C 2 B D C ARISE BUT ONCE EACH THEREFORE THE SUM OF ALL THE SQUARES 2 A  B 2 A  C 2 B  C 2 B  D C   M    A2   M    B2   M    C2 C  2 A B2 A C2BC C   M    A  2 B BUT 2 A  B 106  2 A  C  2 A  D C IS ALWAYS A POSITIVE QUANTITY THEREFORE  M  1  A  2 B IS POSITIVE AND CONSEQUENTLY  M  1  A2 GREATER THAN B COR IT APPEARS FROM THE DEMONSTRATION THAT THE  OF  M  1  A ABOVE 2 B IS ALWAYS EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE SQUARES OF THE DIFFERENCES OF THE QUANTITIES ABCD C AND THAT WHEN THE QUANTITIES A B C D C ARE ALL EQUAL THEN  M  1  A  2 B  0 AND WITH THIS RESTRICTI ON THE PRECEDING LEMMATA MUST BE UNDERSTOOD IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THO WE HAVE SUPPOSED IN THESE LEMMATA THE QUANTITIES A B C D C POSITIVE THEY ARE A FORTIORI TRUE OF NEGATIVE QUANTITIES WHOSE SQUARES ARE THE SAME AS IF THEY WERE POSITIVE WHILE THE SUM OF THEIR PRODUCTS IS EITHER THE SAME OR LESS THAN IT WOULD BE WERE THEY ALL POSITIVE P R O P I IN A QUADRATIC AEQUATION THAT HAS ITS ROOTS REAL THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM MUST BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE QUADRUPLE PRODUCT OF THE THIRD AND FIRST TERMS LET THE ROOTS OF THE QUADRATIC AEQUATION BE REPRE SENTED BY  A AND  B AND IF X BE THE UNKNOWN QUANTITY THEN SHALL X2  A X  A B  0  B X NOW SINCE A2  B2 IS GREATER THAN 2 A B BY LEMMA  THEREFORE A2  B2  2 A B IS GREATER THAN 4 A B THERE FORE 2 AB  X2 THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM WILL BE GREATER THAN 4 A B  X2 THE QUADRUPLE PRODUCT OF THE FIRST AND THIRD TERMS PROP107 P R O P II IN ANY CUBIC AEQUATION ALL WHOSE ROOTS ARE REAL THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE FIRST AND THIRD IF THE CUBIC AEQUATION HAS ALL ITS ROOTS REAL THEY MAY BE REPRESENTED WITH THEIR SIGNS BY ABC AND THE AEQUATION WILL BE EXPRESSED THUS Y3  A Y2  A B Y  A B C  0  B Y2  A C Y  C Y2  B C Y BUT BY LEMMA 2 A2  B2  C2 IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN A BA CB C AND CONSEQUENTLY ADDING 2 A B2 A C 2 B C TO BOTH SIDES A2  B2  C2   A B  2 A C  2 B C   2 ABC WILL BE GREATER THAN 3 A B3 A C3 B C AND THEREFORE 2 ABC  Y4 MUST BE GREATER THAN  3 A B  3 A C  3 B C  Y4 THAT IS THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM MUST BE GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE FIRST AND THIRD TERMS COR 1 IN GENERAL IT APPEARS FROM THE DEMONSTRA TION THAT THE SQUARE OF THE SUM OF THREE REAL QUAN TITIES 2 ABC IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE SUM OF ALL THE PRODUCTS THAT CAN BE MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THEM INTO ONE ANOTHER COR 2 IT FOLLOWS FROM THE PROPOSITION THAT WHEN THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM IS NOT GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE FIRST AND THIRD TERMS THE ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION CANNOT BE ALL REAL BUT TWO OF THEM MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE AND THIS PLAINLY COINCIDES WITH ONE PART OF SIR ISAAC NEWTONS RULE FOR DISCOVERING WHEN THE ROOTS OF CUBIC AEQUATIONS ARE IMPOSSIBLE HE108 HE DESIRES YOU MAY WRITE ABOVE THE MIDDLE TERMS OF THE AEQUATION THE FRACTIONS 13 13 AS IN THE MARGIN AND PLACING THE SIGN  UNDER THE FIRST AND LAST TERM HE MULTIPLIES THE SQUARE OF THE SE COND TERM BY THE FRACTION 13 THAT IS ABOVE IT AND IF THE PRODUCT IS GREATER THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE ADJACENT TERMS HE PLACES  UNDER THE SECOND TERM BUT IF THAT PRODUCT IS LESS HE PLACES  UNDER THE SECOND TERM AND SAYS THERE ARE AS MANY IMPOSSIBLE ROOTS AS CHANGES IN THE SIGNS NOW BY THIS PROPOSITION IF P2 X4 IS NOT GREATER THAN 3 Q X4 OR 13 P2 X4 GREATER THAN Q X4 THE ROOTS CANNOT BE ALL REAL THE SAME SUPPOSI TION MAKES TWO CHANGES IN THE SIGNS WHATEVER SIGN YOU PLACE UNDER THE THIRD TERM SINCE THE SIGNS UNDER THE FIRST AND LAST ARE BOTH  AND THEREFORE THIS PROPO SITION DEMONSTRATES THE FIRST PART OF SIR ISAAC NEWTONS RULE AS FAR AS IT RELATES TO CUBIC AEQUATIONS 13 13 X3PX2QXR  0     COR 3 IF THE SECOND TERM IS WANTING IN A CUBIC AEQUATION AND THE THIRD IS POSITIVE TWO OF THE ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM EQUAL TO NOTHING IN THIS CASE WILL BE LESS THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE ADJACENT TERMS BUT THIS WILL BETTER APPEAR FROM CONSIDERING THAT WHEN THE SECOND TERM VANISHES IN AN AEQUATION THE POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE ROOTS ARE EQUALAND WHEN ADDED TOGETHER DESTROY EACH OTHER SUPPOSE THE ROOTS TO BE  A AND  B  C THEN IN THIS CASE A   B  C AND THE CO EFFICIENT OF THE THIRD TERM WILL BE  A B  A C  B C   B2  2 B C  C2  B C   B2  B C  C2 AND CON SEQUENTLY NEGATIVE OR IF YOU SUPPOSE TWO ROOTS POSITIVE AND ONE NEGATIVE LET THEM BE A  B  C THEN THE COEFFICIENT OF THE THIRD TERM WILL BE STILL  B2  B C  C2 THEREFORE WHEN THE ROOTS ARE REAL THE109 THE COEFFICIENT OF THE THIRD TERM IS NEGATIVE AND IF THE COEFFICIENT OF THE THIRD TERM IS NOT AFFECTED WITH A NEGATIVE SIGN IT IS A PROOF THAT TWO OF THE ROOTS ARE IMPOSSIBLE P R O P III IN ANY CUBIC AEQUATION ALL WHOSE ROOTS ARE REAL THE SQUARE OF THE THIRD TERM MUST BE GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH TERMS IN THE SAME CUBIC AEQUATION WHOSE ROOTS ARE A B C THE SQUARE OF THE THIRD TERM IS 2 A B  A C  B C THE PRO DUCT OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH TERMS IS A2 B C  A B2 C  A B C2 AS IS PLAIN FROM THE INSPECTION OF THE AE QUATION AND IT IS OBVIOUS THAT A2 B CA B2 CA B C2 IS THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS OF ANY TWO OF THE TERMS A B A C B C AND THEREFORE BY COROL 1 PROP 2 THE SQUARE OF THE SUM OF THESE TERMS THAT IS 2 A B  A C  B C MUST BE GREATER THAN 3 A2 B C  3 A B2 C  3 A C2 B SO THAT 2 A B  AC  B C  Y2 MUST BE GREATER THAN  3 A2 B C  3 A B2 C  3 A C2 B  Y2 THAT IS THE SQUARE OF THE THIRD TERM MUST BE GREATER THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH TERMS COR 1 IT FOLLOWS FROM THE DEMONSTRATION THAT 2 A B  A C  B C IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN 3 A B C   A  B  C COR 2 IF THE SQUARE OF THE THIRD TERM IS FOUND TO BE LESS THAN THE TRIPLE PRODUCT OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH TERMS THEN THE ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION CANNOT BE ALL REAL QUANTITIES AND THIS CONCLUDES WITH THE SE COND PART OF SIR ISAAC NEWTONS RULE FOR FINDING WHEN THE ROOTS OF A CUBIC AEQUATION ARE IMPOSSIBLE FOR THIS CASE GIVES  TO BE PLACED UNDER THE THIRD TERM AND 13 13 X3PX2QXR  0     P CON110 CONSEQUENTLY TWO CHANGES OF THE SIGNS WHATEVER SIGN IS PLACED UNDER THE SECOND TERM SCHOL AFTER THE SAME MANNERIT MAY BE DEMONSTRATED THAT IN A CUBIC AEQUATIONWHOSE ROOTS ARE ALL REAL IF THE SECOND TERM IS WANTING THE CUBE OF THE THIRD PART OF THE THIRD TERM TAKEN POSITIVELY IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE SQUARE OF HALF THE LAST TERM SUPPOSE THAT THE ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION ARE  A B C OR A B  C AND THAT ABC THEN THE SECOND TERM IN THE AE QUATION WILL BE WANTING AND THE OTHER TERMS WILL BE EXPRESSED THUS Y3 B2 YB C   BC B C Y C2 Y THE SQUARE OF BC IS ALWAYS POSITIVE SINCE B AND C ARE REAL QUANTITIES SUPPOSE IT VIZ B2  2 B C

THAN DB2C24  B3 C3 SINCE D IS POSITIVE AND B C ALSO POSITIVE B AND C BEING ROOTS HAVING THE SAME SIGN THEREFORE THE CUBE OF  OF THE THIRD TERM HAVING ITS SIGN CHANGED B2BCC2 327 IS ALWAYS GREATER THAN THE SQUARE OF HALF THE LAST TERM  B2 C2 B  C24 IN THE CUBIC AE QUATION X3   Q X  R  O IF Q BE POSITIVE OR IF IT BE111 BE NEGATIVE AND Q327 BE LESS THAN 14 R2 IT APPEARS THAT TWO ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE FROM THIS COROLLARY AND FROM COR 3 PROP 2 TAKEN TOGE THER P R O P IV IN A BIQUADRATIC AEQUATION ALL WHOSE ROOTS ARE REAL QUANTITIES 38 OF THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM IS AL WAYS GREATER THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE FIRST AND THIRD TERMS AND 38 OF THE SQUARE OF THE FOURTH TERM IS AL WAYS GREATER THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE THIRD AND FIFTH TERMS 1 LET THE AEQUATION BE X4P X4Q X2  R XS   AND SINCE THE ROOTS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL REAL LET THEM BE REPRESENTED BY A B C D THEN PABCD AND QA BA CA DB CB DC D BUT IT IS PLAIN FROM LEMMA 3 THAT 3 A2  3 B2  3 C2  3 D2 IS GREATER THAN 2 A B  2 A C  2 A D  2 B C  2 B D  2 C D AND CON SEQUENTLY BY ADDING 6 A B  6 A C  6 A D  6 B C  6 BD  6 C D TO BOTH WE SHALL FIND THAT 3  A  B  C  D2 MUST BE GREATER THAN 8 A B  8 A C  8 A D  8 B C  8 B D  8

SO THAT 38 OF EITHER THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERM OR OF THE SQUARE OF THE FOURTH TERM MUST AL P 2 WAYS112 WAYS BE GREATER THAN THE PRODUCT OF THE TERMS ADJA CENT TO THEM COR MULTIPLY EITHER THE SQUARE OF THE SECOND TERMOR THE SQUARE OF THE FOURTH TERM OF A BIQUADRATIC AEQUA TION BY 38 AND IF THE PRODUCT DOES NOT EXCEED THE PRO DUCT OF THE ADJACENT TERMS SOME OF THE ROOTS OF THAT AEQUATION MUST BE IMPOSSIBLE P R O P V IN AN AEQUATION OF ANY DIMENSION EXPRESSED BY M THE COEFFICIENTS OF THE SECOND THIRD LAST LAST BUT ONE AND LAST BUT TWO TERMS BEING RESPECTIVELY A B E D C IF THE ROOTS OF THE AEQUATION ARE ALL REAL THEN SHALL M1  A2 ALWAYS BE GREATER THAN 2 M B AND M1  D2 GREATER THAN 2 M C E 1 FOR SUPPOSING THE ROOTS TO BE A B C D E C THEN BY LEMMA 4 SHALL M1  A2  M1  B2  M1 C2 C BE GREATER THAN 2 A B  2 A C  2 A D C AND AD DING 2 M  2 A B  2 M  2  A C  2 M2  A DC TO BOTH THE SUM M1  A2  2 M2 A B  M1  B2  C M1  A  B  C C2 MUST BE GREATER THAN 2 M A B  2 M A C  2 M A D C THAT IS M1  A2 MUST BE GREATER THAN 2 M B 2 IN GENERAL IT FOLLOWS FROM THIS DEMONSTRATION THAT THE SQUARE OF THE SUM OF ANY QUANTITIES WHOSE NUMBER IS M MULTIPLIED BY M1 MUST BE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF ALL THE PRODUCTS CAN BE MADE BY MULTIPLY ING ANY TWO OF THEM MULTIPLIED BY 2 M BUT IT IS EASIE TO SEE FROM THE GENESIS OF AEQUATIONSTHAT C E IS THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS CAN BE MADE BY MULTIPLYING ANY TWO OF THE TERMS WHOSE SUM IS D FROM WHICH IT FOLLOWSTHAT M1  D2 MUST BE ALWAYS GREATER THAN 2 M C E TO BE CONTINUED V A

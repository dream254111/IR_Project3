not be surpris ing although one would think they would prefer to avoid publicly displaying the fact and would be willing to travel some distance in order to find some person who could help them in the matter of spell ing But when well educated men support such a doctrine one feels that they have cre ated out of the law of priority a fetish which they worship with a devotion quite too nar row The form of our nomenclature being Latin the rules of Latin orthography and grammar are as incumbent on us to observe as are the corresponding rules of English grammar in our ordinary speech This cult so far as I know exists only in the United States and among certain members of the American Ornithologists Union The pre servation of names which their authors never defined of names which their proposers mis spelled of names from the Greek in Greek instead of Latin form of English hyphens in Latin composition and of hybrid com binations of Greek and Latin are objects hardly worth contending for Some few authors are quite independent of rules in the use of gender terminations but I notice the A 0 U requires these to be printed cor rectly Apart from this I notice in the sec ond edition of their check list of North American Birds just issued only eighteen misspellings out of a total number of 768 specific and subspecific names and the gen eric and other names accompanying These are of course not due to ignorance on the part of the members of this body some of whom are distinguished for scholarship but because of an extreme view of the law of priority In closing I wish to utter a plea for euphony and brevity in the construction of names In some quarters the making of such names is an unknown art The sim ple and apprbpriate names of Linneus and fivier can be still duplicated if students would look into the matter A great num ber of such names can be devised by the use of significant Greek prefixes attached to sub stantives which may or may not have been often used Personal names in Greek have much significance and they are of ten short and euphonious The unap propriated wealth is so great that there is really no necessity for poverty in this direc tion It should be rarely necessary for in stance to construct generic names by add ing prefixes and suffixes of no meaning to a standard generic name already in use E D COPE THE ORIGIN AND RELATIONS OF THE FLORAS AND FAUNAS OF THE ANT ARCTIC AND ADJACENT REGIONS The Geology of the Antarctic Regions ANGELO HEILPRIN Philadelphia Academy of Na tural Sciences Reviewing our present knowledge of the Antarctic regions Prof Heilprin stated that it rests almost where it was a halfcentury ago when Sir James Clark Ross 1841 1842 made his memorable cruises in the Erebus and Terror and attained the high southing of 78 10 This was at a position almost due south of New Zealand along a coast line sharply defined by ele vated mountain masses to which the dar ing British navigator gave the name of Vic toria Land At that time other patches of ice bound land or what was presumed to be land had already been discovered and named by Bellamy Biscoe Dumont d Urville and Wilkessuch as Clarie Land Sabrina Land etc south of the Aus tralian continent Enderby Land Kemp Land Graham and Alexander Lands south of Patagoniaand from these had been on stituted the Antarctic continent of Wilkes and of many modern geographers

a continent but to the present time it cannot be said that its ex istence has been demonstrated A number of considerations speak in favor of it but many more facts than we now possess will be needed before anything like a satisfac tory determination of this question can be assumed It is significant in this connec tion that both Ross and Petermann to whom as explorer and student we owe the better part of our knowledge of Antarctica inclined their views against the existence of such a southern continent In their opin ions the reported land masses are of an is land character bound together perhaps not even permanently by a vast frequently shifting ice pack the edge of which only in small part the terminal wall of giant glaciers is the great Antarctic barrier of geographers and navigators How far the vertical icebarrier is confluent with the cemented pack remains yet to be de termined The only important addition to our knowledge of true Antarctica that has been made since Rosss voyage belongs to the close of the year 1893 when Larsen pene trated in the region of the Graham Land complex to Lat 68 10 S and brought back with him a  departure in the geolog ical concept of the region under considera tion The finding of Tertiary fossils Cy therea Natica etc on Seymour Island Cape Seymour is the opening vista in an investigation which has heretofore been considered closed and at once affords to use a business term a basis for considera tion Not less significant is the finding at the same locality of an abundance of tree remains conifersArancaria  These fragments at least show that some part of Antarctica was of the same kind of con struction as the continents generally and their special facies immediately suggests a South American relationship Previous to 1893 the only rocks known from the ice bound region of the far South were gran ites gneisses and related schists the strictly eruptive and trappean rocks and certain red sandstones Piners Island Triassic  from a very limited area Most and perhaps nearly all of the higher mountains are distinctly of a volcanic na ture and many of them bear huge craters on their summits Ross found Erebus in eruption at the time of his visit 1841 and Larsen found the mountains of Christ ensen and Lindenberg Islands similarly active in 189394 Borchgrevink who sailed over a portion of Rosss course in 189495 attaining

from the heights of the Sa bine Mountains He was the first to set foot on the mainland or main island of Antarctica and to him science also owes the first discovery within this realm of a rockcovering vegetation lichens on Pos session Island and Cape Adare It can hardly be said that we know much regarding either the source or the nature of the vast ice mass which makes up nearly the whole of visible Antarctica it may or may not be in principal part of glacial con struction it may be largely or mainly an oceansurface accumulation extending back in its formation through hundreds or thou sands of years Until we know what is be low or behind it this question will remain unanswered Giant glaciers there are and an abundance of them but over enormous expanses where the ice barrier presents an impassable front no visible distant ice cap like the one of Greenland has been de tected In its relations to the other continents there is reason to believe that Antarctica whether as a continent or in fragmented 306 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 28 1896 parts had a definite connection with one or more of the land masses lying to the north and the suspicion can hardly be avoided that such connection was if with nothing else with at least New Zealand and through it with Australia and Patagonia In the frag mented parts of Graham Land archipelago and the outlying South Orkney and South Georgian islands we seem to have the bond of connection with the South American main or more specifically a line of curva ture of the great Andean chain which in its broken parts can still be traced far be yond its present continental termination If this concept is a true one it places before us a parallel to the Andean curvature in the northern part of the South American Con tinent where the mountain system is de flected off into the broken mass of the Lesser Antilles to the Aleutian flexure of the Cor dilleran system of North America and to the ApennineAtlas and  CarpathianBal kan flexures of the Alpine mountains the nature of which has been so clearly stated by Suess In fact it is hardly possible that any very extensive meridianal or latitudi nal mountain chain could have been forced up through contractional force without some such deflection being represented in one or more parts of its course and where these deflections are found they are almost cer tain to be areas of breakage The dis ruption of the Andean system is still or has until recently been taking place as is evi denced in a portion of the Chilian archipel ago Antarctica Palceontology PROF W B SCOTT Princeton University It is a truism that the most satisfactory evidence concerning the former existence of land connections which have long since dis appeared beneath the sea is to be derived from the distribution of land animals re cent and fossil In the northern hemis phere this evidence is very extensive for all of the great land masses and for those later divisions of geologicaltime in which terres trial life began to play an important part In the southern hemisphere the case is un fortunately different only South America having as yet yielded numerous and well preserved remains of Tertiary mammals Pleistocene fossils which have an impor tant though somewhat inconclusive bear ing upon the problem of the Antarctic con tinent occur in other regions such as Mada gascar Australia and New Zealand but the evidence is still fragmentary and leaves much to be desired In the Permian we first find indications of a type of fossils common to the southern hemisphere and distinct from the contem porary life of the northern This is the much discussed Glossopteris Flora char acterized by the fern of that name and by an assemblage of plants which is more like the Triassic than the Permian of the north ern continent The Glossopteris Flora has been found in India South Africa Austra lia and quite lately in the Argentine Re public and obviously points to an Antarctic center of distribution Though the distribu tion of the Glossopteris Flora does not demon strate that the lands in which it occurs were all connected together yet it renders such connection probable Judging from the an alogy of the existing land masses it seems likely that the connection was rather by means of a circumpolar continent with northward extensions than through east and west landbridges or a great single con tinent occupying the site of the Indian South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans The evidence of Mesozoic fossils is very unsatisfactory Lydekker has called atten tion to the likeness between the Jurassic Dinosaurs of India South Africa and Pata gonia and so far as it goes this fact would indicate a general persistence of the same land connections as those which obtained in Permian times SCIENCE 307N S VOL III No 61 When we reach the Tertiary important facts become available but as in the earlier ages too fragmentary to be conclusive A long succession of Tertiary land faunas is known only from South America Even the most cursory examination of these faunas shows in the most unmistakable manner the extreme isolation of South America The oldest of the Tertiary for mations of Patagonia the Pyrotherium beds have yielded a fauna which promises to prove of the highest interest but as yet it is so imperfectly known that it cannot be em ployed in the solution of the Antarctic problem The earlier Miocene Santa Cruz mammals of that continent are totally dif ferent from those of the northern land masses so much so that the correlation of horizons becomes a matter of extreme diffi culty The hoofed animals all belong to orders unknown in the north Toxodontia Typotheria Litopterna and the principal con stituents of the fauna are immense numbers of Edentates Marsupials and Rodents with several platyrrhine monkeys No artiodac tyls perissodactyls proboscidians Condy larthra or Amblypoda neither Insectivora Cheiroptera Carnivora or Creodonta are known The Edentates are all of the spe cifically South American type sloths arma dillos and the like The Rodents also are very much like those which still charac terize the region though most of the genera are distinct they are all Hystricomorpha neither squirrels marmots beavers rats or mice hares or rabbits occurring among them The Primates are typically neotropi cal and evidently belong to the platyrrhine group The Marsupials are partly opos sums more or less like those which still inhabit the Americas and what is at first sight very surprising partly of Australian type The latter contain both diprotodont forms Abderites Acdestis Epanorthus allied to the existing Hypsiprymnus and polypro todont genera Protoproviverra Cladosictis etc the affinity of which to the Dasyuridce is clear Ameghino it is true places these latter forms in a new order the Sparasso dontia but this seems unnecessary and mis leading The fauna of the succeeding  Patagonian formation is of exactly the same general character and contains no new elements but merely somewhat more advanced gen era of the same orders while the Marsupials are much reduced in numbers and impor tance In the Pliocene Monte Hermoso ap pear the first traces of the union with North America in the presence of mastodons horses tapirs deer llamas and true carni vores and from that time till far into the Pleistocene the intermigrations between the two continents kept up until a large num ber of common types had been established The curious composition of the South American mammalian fauna in Tertiary times presents us with some very wellde fined but extremely difficult problems 1 How is the presence of groups to be ex plained which have a clear relationship to those belonging to the Northern hemi sphere namely the Primates Ungulates and Rodents An easy short cut out of the difficulty would be to assume that the re lationship is only apparent and due to con vergent development It is of course pos sible that such is the true explanation but it is most unlikely and in the absence of any evidence in its favor we need not stop to discuss it Much more probable is it that these groups point to some connection di rect or indirect with the northern hemi sphere either in late Mesozoic or early Tertiary times One would naturally ex pect to find that this connection was by way of North America but there are grave difficulties in the way of such a view As we have seen the indigenous South Ameri can rodents were all hystricomorphs and while this group is represented in Europe 308 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 28 1896 in later Oligocene beds it does not ap pear in North America till the end of the Miocene or beginning of the Pliocene and is very scantily represented here today The Ungulates are much more distantly related to those of the north and can be connected only by remote ancestors for the divergence is very striking in the oldest South Ameri can forms yet recovered If the connection with the north was not by means of North America it can only have been through Africa Admitting such connection it is much more likely to have been due to the junction of both continents with the Ant arctic land mass than to a Transatlantic bridge Such a mode of connection would explain the very wide divergences in the character of the mammalian faunas which still exist between Africa and South Amer ica for a circumpolar land would very likely oppose climatic barriers to migration and confine that migration to comparatively few groups 2 The presence of nmmerous marsupials of distinctively Australian type in the Tertiary rocks of South America is very strong evidence indeed that both of those continents were connected with the Antarctic land The Australianmarsupials have been much misunderstood and many observers appear to think that Australia is a sort of museum which has preserved Jurassic types to this day As a matter of fact these marsupials are an extremely di versified and modernized assemblage of forms which have paralleled the placental orders in a remarkable way Their struc ture is it is true fundamentally primitive but their many and divergent adaptions are modern That these marsupials indicate a land connection between South America and Australia can hardly be denied for none of them have ever been found in any northern continent If it be asked why this sup posed migration was all in one direction and why South American mammals did not reach Australia several possible explana tions suggest themselves a The mar supials may have originated in South America and covering the South Polar lands have reached Australia which was then severed from Antarctica before the Placentals had made their appearance in South America b Placentals may have reached Australia but not kept a foothold there finding conditions unfavorable to them These possibilities seem very un likely and much more probable is a third explanation c The Australian connec tion with Antarctica first existed and al lowed the marsupials to spread over the polar lands Before South Americabecame connected with the circumpolar area the latter was severed from Australia Until Tertiary mammals are recovered in Austra lia explanation of these curious circum stances must remain conjectural What is known of Australian Pleistocene mammals indicates that nothing had reached that continent from South America Another line of evidence which trends in the same general direction as that which we have already considered is given by the Pleistocene birds of the southern hemi sphere to which attention has been directed by Forbes and more recently by Milne Ed wards and others The weight which should be given to evidence of this kind is very difficult to determine because of the uncertainty which still obtains concerning the real relationship of the birds in ques tion The extinct types of wingless rails which are found in New Zealand the Chat ham Islands the Mascarene Islands are be lieved by many to indicate land bridges while AEpyornis of Madagascar the Moas of New Zealand the Emeus of Australia and the gigantic Tertiary birds of the Argentine Republic Brontornis Phoro rhacus Opisthodactylus are supposed to be branches of the same stock of Ratitae Until however we learn a great deal more than is known at present with regard to SCIENCE 309N S VOL III No 61 the phylogeny and relationships of these great birds I personally do not feel at all assured that we can safely reason from their distribution to problems of former land connections On the other hand it should be noted that this distribution is in harmony with the results reached by study of the mammals In conclusion it may be observed that the facts of paleontology may best be ex plained on the assumption that the Ant arctic land mass has at one time or another been connected with Africa Australia and South America which formerly radiated from the South Pole as North America and Eurasia now do from the North Pole While this seems a highly probable assump tion much remains to be done before the history of the southern continents is as well known as that of the northern ones and in particular many questions must remain open until the Tertiary mammals of Africa and Australia shall have been recovered It is interesting to observe that we are again approximating to the views expressed by Riitimeyer in 1867 Botany PROF N L BRITTON Columbia College Prof Britton took up the subject from the standpoint of Antarctic botany He re marked that as nothing worth consideration was known of the flora of the Antarctic Continent the inquiry must be restricted to a consideration of the vegetation of the ex treme southern parts of South America South Africa New Zealand and the islands of the South Pacific Ocean Genera of wide distribution cannot enter as factors in the inquiry except in cases where closely re lated or identical species occur in two or more of these areas Genera and species of circumtropical distribution must be consid ered with caution because this distribu tion may or may not have a bearing on the problem He noted that this circum tropical distribution of plants is well marked large numbers of genera and spe cies being common to the warmer parts of America Australasia and Asia and some common to tropical America and Africa Types of cosmopolitan distribution must ob viously be ignored Types of simple organ ization typically of wide distribution can not fairly be considered He submitted the following cases of dis tribution selected from widely different families from the Bryophytes upward MuscI Andrcea

similarity of the floras was in reality very slight and that in his opinion it was not necessary to invoke former land connection across the Antarctic region in explanation The Terrestrial Invertebrata By PROF A S PACKARD Brown University In comparing the terrestrial Arctic and Antarctic regions the conditions are most unlike and literally as wide apart as the Poles The Arctic regions form a large pro portion of the land hemisphere with a com paratively abundant terrestrial flora and fauna During the Neocene Tertiary the arctic land masses were more extensive than now more continuous and with little doubt their subtropical lifeforms both plant and animal constituted an assemblage which sent out waves of migration passing south ward and colonizing either side of the Amer ican and Eurasian late Tertiary continents The present Arctic and Alpine life as also the plants and animals of boreal and north temperate Eurasia and America are with little doubt the modified descendants of the Tertiary Arctic regions When we pass to the South Pole the condi tions are in the light of our present knowl edge diametrically opposite The conti nental Antarctic land masses may or may not be connected Until 1893 a human be ing had not landed on the mainland and even then the ice and snowclad land re vealed only a few lichens and the rocks a few specimens of Tertiary strata Not a trace of terrestrial invertebrate life was dis covered Should as it is to be earnestly hoped an Antarctic expedition at no distant day ex SCIENCE 311N S VOL III No 61 plore the mainland it may be predicted judging by what we know of the inverte brate land fauna of Kerguelen Island that one or two Lumbricoid worms a terrestrial mollusc one or two species of spiders sev eral species of acarina and of Collembola a few species of Coleoptera Lepidoptera and Diptera including perhaps a mosquito and possibly some species of parasitic Hy menoptera will be found to constitute the land invertebrate fauna Should any flowering plants ever be dis covered there will probably be added to the list a few of the higher mothsand possibly a butterfly a bumble bee or two and a few muscids which in the high Arctic regions visit flowers As there are no land birds or indigenous mammals nor so far as we know any summer migrant birds such insects if present should abound in individuals there being no larger animals to reduce their numbers We may now proceed to enumerate the terrestrial fauna of Kerguelen Island the nearest region of whose land invertebrates we know anything VERMES

INSECTA Collembola Tullbergia antarctica Lubbock in moss Isotoma sp Smynthurus sp under stones COLEOPTERA Rhyncophora or weevils six species also a Staphylinid Phytosus atriceps These occurred in moss

brilliantly colored specimen taken having flown into my hut one night at tracted by thelight Besides these little black beetles were caught on rocks near the sea and about the roots of wet tufts of moss They belong to the genus Octhe bius of the aquatic family Helophoride LEPIDOPTERA Dr Kidder captured  two lepidopterous insects of moderate size with very imper fect and abbreviated wings active in their movements Mr Eaton found quite a number of larvae and pupme of a small noc turnal moth remarkable for the extreme brevity of the second pair of wings He names it Embryonopsis halticella DIPTERA Besides Musca canicularis Linn a cos mopolitan species six species of flies be longing to new genera four of which have vestigial wings are characteristic of this island and are of peculiar interest Dr Kidder remarks of three of the genera of wingless flies that they counter feited death when in danger The carrion feeder Anatalanta aptera Eaton has no vestige of either wings or balances hal teres The leaf feeders Calycopteryx mosleyi Eaton found on the leaves of the Ker guelen cabbage resembled large black ants as they were active in their movements dark brown with long legs The wings are reduced to small scales  The third genus Amalopteryx maritima Eaton was discovered on wet rocks at the SCIENCE 312SCIENCE edge of the sea They are provided with small triangular vestigial wings and bal ancers They cannot fly but seem to use the wings in jumping which they do with great activity making it quite difficult to catch them They do not appear to jump in any definite direction but spring into the air buzzing the small winglets with great activity and seem to trust to chance for a spot on which to alight tumbling over and over in the air I never observed them jumping when undisturbed Dr Kidder adds that  the only flying in sect observed by me while on the island he apparently momentarily overlooked the  larger flying weevil was a small gnat Mr Eaton also describes a tipulid Halyritus amphibius with imperfect or abortive wings Of the exact relationship and origin of this restricted island fauna but little in the present state of our knowledge can be said To which family the moth belongs I am at present unable to state As to the Diptera they are mostly muscidae and this family is more largely represented in the Arctic re gions and on Alpine summits the world over than any other group But this is not the case with the Coleoptera of this order the Carabidse are most numerously represented in Arctic and Alpine regions and they are common in Chili while the weevils are the least in number of species in Arctic regions And yet out of the eight species of beetles in habiting Kerguelen Island six are weevils a group most numerously represented in subtropical and tropical regions This would seem to indicate that this island was colo nized by waifs from the land to the westward whether from Australia Africa or South America I should not dare to say On the other hand the land plants and the marine fauna appear to have elements more in com mon with Patagonia and Fuegia and this may be explained by the cold polar current which is said to flow from the Antarctic re gion towards Cape Horn 313 Darwin has in his Origin of Species called attention to a remarkable feature of the Madeiran Coleoptera i e the unusual prevalence of apterous or wingless species No less than twentytwo genera which are usually or sometimes winged in Europe having only wingless species in Madeira Mr Wallaston discovered that 200 beetles out of 550 species then known to inhabit Madeira are so far deficient in wings that they cannot fly These facts led Darwin to believe that the wingless condition of so many Madeira beetles is mainly due to the action of natural selection but combined probably with disuse For during many suc cessive generations each individual beetle which flew least either from its wings hav ing been ever so little less perfectly devel oped or from indolent habits will have had the best chance of surviving from not being blown out to sea and on the other hand those beetles which most readily took to flight could oftenest have been blown to sea and thus have been destroyed On the other hand the wings of the flowerfeeding Coleoptera and Lepidoptera which are hab itually on the wing have as Mr Wallaston suspects their wings not at all reduced but even enlarged He adds that the pro portion of wingless beetles is larger on the exposed island Desertas than in Madeira it self Mr Wallace in his great work The Geographical Distribution of Animals  ii pp 211 cites the wingless insects of Ker guelen Island as a remarkable confirmation of this theory The poverty of the land fauna of Ker guelen Island and the reduction in the wings of the insects are so intimately cor related with the extremely unfavorable cli matic condition under which these animals exist that the loss or reduction in the size of the wings may we venture to suggest be explained as the result of the direct action of some of the primary factors of organic evolution FEBRUARY 28 1896N S VOL III No 61 As Dr Kidder states  The general as pect of the island is desolate in the ex treme Snow covers all the higher hills Only along the seashore is a narrow belt of herbage of which the singular Kerguelen cabbage is at once the largest and most con spicuous component The weather is also extremely inclement there being scarcely a day without snow or rain Violent gales of wind prevail to an extent unknown in the same northern latitude It was often impossible to go on foot any considerable dis tance from the home station on account of the severity of the wind Sir J Clarke Ross tells of one of his men being actually blown into the sea and of saving himself from a like accident only by lying flat on the ground There are no shrubs or trees on the island The winter season is remarkably mild This set of climatic conditions the con tinued strong winds the low temperature throughout the year and the absence of the sun for the greater part of the year consti tute an environment sufficient we should think to account for the disuse and result ing atrophy of the wings without invoking the aid of natural selection unless we allow that the principle may work as a final and subordinate factor At all events these agencies and disuse should be the first to suggest themselves as they are so tangible and easily understood Under these conditions the beetles flies and moths would be driven to seek shelter under stones or by burrowing deep in the damp wet moss By simple disuse the wings would begin to atrophy and after a comparatively few generations become re duced or in extreme cases almost entirely lost Certainly the initial cause is the cli matic conditions To these persisting cen tury after century the organism would di rectly respond and we do not see the need of evoking the aid of natural selection in genious and speculative as it is any more than in accounting for the loss of eyesight or of eyes with important parts of the brain in cave animals or in deep sea or abyssal forms we should resort to natural selec tion Moreover Darwin himself expressly stated that in the case of cave animals natural selection was not operative Certainly in the present case disuse due to the direct action of the environment appears to be an effi cient adequate cause Vertebrata of the Land Fishes Batrachia and Reptiles By DR THEO GILLWashington Dr Gill called attention to the discrep ancy between the evidence already de duced from the plants and invertebrates and that which would result from the con sideration of the higher vertebrates These discrepancies are in accord with the differ ences in the geological history of the sev eral classes For example all the families of mammals so far as certainly known have originated since the commencement of the tertiary most of the prominent families and very many genera of mollusks still ex isting flourished at least as early as the Jurassic and Cretaceous The Jurassic freshwater faunas were especially consid ered Fishes are intermediate between those two types Naturally the persistence in duration of the several classes is reflected in the distribution in space Many fam ilies of mammals are confined to special zoogeographical continents but extremely few families of articulates or mollusks are so limited In fact we can avail ourselves of the data furnished by the different divi sions for chronometrical purposes the mol lusk answers to an hour hand the mammal to a minute hand The fishes yield data for the determination of intermediate points Remembering these postulates the evidence given by the distribution of the freshwater fishes is significant less so is that of the amphibians and reptiles because they have superior means of locomotion 314 SCIENCEFEBRUARY 28 1896 There are two families of freshwater fishes confined to the cold and temperate waters of the southern hemisphere and generally distributed in such  they are the Galaxiids and Aplochitonids the former were associated by the old ichthyologist with the pikes and the latter with the salmonids but they really have no such relationship but are closely related to each other and segregated from all others The Galaxiids are represented by one genus Galaxias of which about five species occur in South America five species in Tasmania ten species in Australia and five species in New Zealand A monotypic genus Neochanna is confined to New Zealand The Aplo chitonids number only six species referable to two genera of these two are found in South America Aplochiton two in Tasmania Aplochiton and Prototroctes one in Aus tralia and one in New Zealand Proto troctes It was long supposed that no species of either family of Galaxioidean fishes oc cured in Africa but last year Dr Stein dachner described a representative of Ga laxias G capensis and consequently we now have South Africa to consider with reference to a former community of popula tion and continuity of land of all the south ern hemisphere The conditions of existence and propaga tion of freshwater fishes were then dis cussed and the chances against diffusion of any freshwater fish across the ocean or by other means than natural water courses were weighed In finally taking into consideration the limited distribution northwards and the close relationship of the species of the sev eral regions referred to it was urged that the evidence in favor of a former Antarctic con tinental area was strong and in view of the affinities of the species of the now distant regions the conclusion was logical that the time of disruption was not remote in a ge ological sense It was suggested that such disruption might have been coeval with the final uplift of the Andes The amphibians and reptiles furnish no data bearing directly on an Antarctic con tinent but do yield some though very slight bearing on an earlier and more northern connection of the southern conti nents Much more cogent and less ambig uous is the evidence resulting from the study of the fishes The fishes of tropical Africa may be ranked under two grand categories One of these comprises species of genera or groups represented more largely in Asia and the other of forms related to types otherwise confined to tropical America These Afric American forms belong to the extensive fam ilies of Characinids and Cichlids or Chro mids Fishes of these families are the most conspicuous and numerous in both continents The representatives of the two families of the different continents always belong to different genera and often to different groups of genera or subfamilies We have therefore in the fishes as in the mammals conflicting evidence According to one set of facts the continents of Africa and Asia are similar and in fact they have been united to form one zoological realm according to the other the primi tive fauna of Africa is more like that of America Just two decades ago 1875 the speaker explained this apparent contradic tion by the assumption that the aborigi nal types had been early derived from a common source and for that reason com bined Africa with South America and Aus tralia in a zoological hemisphere which he named EOGEA and contrasted with an other called CENOGaA embracing Asia Europe and North America The numerous species congeneric with Asiatic and Euro pean types were considered to be recent em igrants geologically considered The pur port of all the evidence was that there may SCIENCE 315N S VOL III No 61 have been some connection between Africa and South America early in the tertiary epoch This connection in the present con dition of our ignorance of paleontological facts appears to be more probable than the derivation of the common peculiarities of the faunas of the two continents from a former cosmopolitan fauna or northern areas which have lost them leaving them to the two southern continents only The union of Africa with Asia culminated too late to allow of much differentiation of the invading forces that spead over its wide domain A former quasicosmopolitan fauna was nevertheless manifest in the case of the Ceratodontids but in Europe and North America they flourished early in Mesozoic times and none survived later than the Jurassic and approximately coeval with them were species which lived in India and Africa but all these died out and the only survivors are the species of Neoceratods of tropical Australia This family was men tioned as an extreme case of persistence for an osseous fish type The amphibians furnish very ambiguous evidence if the accepted taxomy is correct For example on the one hand the Cysti gnathids are well developed and limited to America and Australia but on the other the Discoglossids are all European except one genus Liopelma and that is confined to New Zealand The reptiles contribute data looking in different directions One of the ablest herpetologists of all time has expressed the opinion that if a division of the world had to be framed according to the lizard fau nas the Ethiopian and Palmearctic regions should be combined in one Occidental and the Australian and oriental in another  Ori ental to be themselves aggregated in a realm PALMEOGEAN differentiated from another NEOGEAN comprising the Neotropical and Nearctic regions Their mode of distribu tion in fact approximates that of birds but has been seriously affected by their intoler ance of cold and consequently the loss of types which might be interchanged between the continents The similarity between the African and Palsearctic regions is doubtless due to the intrusion of forms from the latter into the former The African how ever has three small families restricted to its area and two shared with America Quite different is the distribution of the tortoises The superfamily of the Pleurodirous or Chelyoidean tortoises is restricted to the southern continents One family Ster nothaerids is peculiar to Africa one Chelyidse to America and one Chelo dinids to the Australian realm while one Podocnemidids is common to Africa and America and another Rhinemydids to America and Australia Except in America these completely replace the fresh water cryptodirous tortoises but it is noteworthy that species of the terrestrial Testudinids generally considered as congeneric occur in all the warm continents except the Aus tralian It must not be forgotten that formerly in early tertiary times the Chely oideans were represented and it has been claimed even by a still existing genus Podocnemis in the northern hemisphere and therefore their present occurrence only in the southern continents loses much of its significance The evidence of former con nections of the southern hemisphere fur nished by both amphibians and reptiles is indeed of very little account per se and is only significant as collateral to that pre sented by other classes To sum up the results of studies of the several classes the present evidence points to a comparatively recent union of or con nection between the southern continents The inference independent of the ichthyo logical data is based in part on the infor mation respecting the geological duration of 316 SCIENCEFEiBRUARY 28 1896 mammal families derived from studies of northern strata and in part on the identifi cation of mammal remains of Patagonian strata with Dasyurids but this evidence may prove illusive Of some importance in estimating the age is the rediscovery by Mr Thomas after 20 years of the Hyra codon of Tomes and its reference to the supposed extinct family of Epanorthids This evidence however is by no means conclusive Rather violent assumptions be come necessary of remarkable dynamical conditions and the peopling of the said con tinents by the same type may be hereafter explained otherwise But in the present condition of our knowledge or ignorance if you will less violent assumptions ap pear to be called for by the hypothesis that has now been presented than by any other It must be distinctly understood however that it is a hypothesis and a tentative hypo thesis only But until it is replaced by a better one or by ascertained facts the hypo thesis will assuredly be useful in directing investigation Vertebrata of the Land Birds and Mammals By DR J A ALLEN American Museum of Natural History New York So far as existing mammals and birds are concerned there seems to be very slight need for calling in the aid of a former Ant arctic continent to explain their present dis tribution Among mammals the distribu tion of Marsupials alone gives a hint of a pos sible former land connection between South America and Australia The recent dis covery Thomas Ann and Mag Nat Hist 6 XVI Nov 1895 p 367 of a form of AMarsupial in Colombia belonging to the hitherto supposed extinct family Epanor thlidae and the occurrence of several dis tinctly Australian types among the fossil Marsupials of Patagonia would seem to add much emphasis to this hint On the other hand the absence of all other South Amer ican types of either mammals or birds from the Australian region and the presence of the remains of numerous opossumlike ani mals in the Eocene of both North America and Europe suggest a possible line of exten sion by way of the northern land masses without the aid of any former land bridges in the southern hemisphere Possibly worthy of consideration here is the wide distribution of Mesozoic mammals and the probable Marsupial affinities of at least some of them In regard to birds after excluding wide ranging types which have no bearing on the subject in question there are no groups common to South America and either Africa or Australia The distribution of the socalled Ratitae and other flightless birds so often cited as evidence of a former Antarctic continent has really very little bearing on the question The socalled subclass Ratitae includes according to the best recent authorities no less than six orders of which the South American rheas Rhese form one and the only one found in the New World the ostriches of Africa form another Struthiones which in Pliocene times ranged as far north and east as southern Europe and India the kiwis of New Zealand form a third Ap teryges the cassowaries and emus of the Australian region a fourth Megistanes the recently extinct genus iEpyornis of Madagascar a fifth Aepyornithes and the recently extinct moas of New Zealand a sixth Immanes The prevalent notion that all these forms are closely related and must have had a common origin doubtless rests on such superficial resemblances as large size and flightless condition Mainly for the same insufficient reason it is the fashion to refer to the Ratitae such little known extinct forms as Gastornis and Dasornis of Europe Diatryma of North Amer ica and Brontornis Phororhacos Pelycornis Opisthodactylus etc of Patagonia Although SCIENCE 317N S VOL III No 61 some of them appear to have Ratite affini ties others present quite as strong relation ship to Carinate types Most of them are known however from such fragmentary re mains that little can be said as to their real affinities Indeed it is the belief of several eminent authorities that the socalled Ra titae constitute a very heterogeneous group the prominent types of which originated in dependently from perfectly distinct Cari nate ancestors The fact of the occurrence either still living or only recently extinct of degenerate flightless forms in such widely distinct Carinate groups as parrots birds of prey pigeons ducks and geese coots gallinules and rails auks grebes etc and that they are in general among the largest members of their respective groups and also generally inhabitants of islands shows that mere flightlessness large size insular habitat and an unkeeled sternum are factors of slight importance Mr H 0 Forbes in his plea for an Ant arctic continent Antipodea originally laid great stress upon his discovery at the Chat ham Islands of an extinct flightless rail al lied to an extinct flightless rail of the genus Aphanapteryx found in Madagascar Indeed this discovery seems to have been largely the foundation of his original tremendous hypothesis as Mr Wallace has called it of an Antarctic continent In Madagascar Aphanapteryx was contemporary with the dodo both existing down to about two hundred years ago The Chatham Island remains were found in kitchen middens of the Morioris showing that here the sup posed Aphanapteryx existed to a compara tively recent date Later examinations by competent authority however of the Chat ham Island remains has shown that they are not congeneric with Aphanapteryx It is of interest to note in this connection that some ten genera of flightless Ralline birds are known three or four of which are still living while most of the others have become extinct only within historic times They are all island birds and nearly all happen to occur in the southern hemi sphere the localities being the islands of Mauritius Rodriguez Gough Tristan d Acunha Samoa Chatham and New Zea land but ranging north also to the Moluc cas Furthermore it happens that they represent all of the leading types of the family Rallidse as rails coots gallinules and porphyrios and hence have no very intimate relationship The fact of their being insular forms thus has not necessarily any bearing on the question of former south ern land areas especially since they are as much tropical and subtropical as austral and belong to an ancient type of bird life of cosmopolitan distribution The current be lief among ornithologists is that all these forms originated at or near where they are now found from ancestors that could fly In support of this belief is the fact that one of the earliest marks which distinguish in sular forms from their nearest mainland allies and probable ancestors is the reduc tion of the wings and the corresponding in creased development of the pelvic limbs as is illustrated in the birds of the Guadalupe Islands off the coast of Lower California and the Galapagos Islands This change is obviously the result of the new conditions of lifethe very limited area to which they are restricted their sedentary and non migratory habits and their comparative freedom from harrassing rapacious enemies The Ratitae and supposed Ratite forms which have so generally been cited in evi dence of former connected Antarctic land areas in reality afford no greater proof of such land bridges than do Carinate birds when we consider how very distinct are the ordinal groups into which this subclass is divided and how widely each one is sepa rated geographically from all the others If we had moas or ostriches or kiwis or cassowaries or any one of the six orders 318 SCIENCESCIENCE represented in all three of the present southern continents or in even two of them the case would be different The single order Passeres includes families peculiar respectively to South America Africa and Australia which are far more closely re lated to each other than are the several orders of the Ratitae inter se yet no one thinks of urging these Passerine groups as evidence of a former Antarctic continent They are supposed to have originated in dependently where they are now found and to havenever existed elsewhere There are on the other hand several families of Carinate birds belonging to dif ferent orders which inhabit the tropi cal and subtropical regions of both the Eastern and Western hemispheres but which now and for long ages past have had no possible means of migration from Amer ica to Africa or to India or to Australia That the present New World and Old World representatives of these several groups must have had respectively a com mon origin is beyond question and it is be lieved to be equally beyond question that they reached their present areas of distribu tion by the northern land route that formed the means of intercommunication between the northern land masses for so many of the widely dispersed terrestrial forms of life Another factor bearing on the general question is the early origin of many of the existing genera of birds most of the known Pliocene genera still surviving while many of the Lower Miocene and Upper Eocene genera of Europe and North America are in some cases identical in others closely al lied to genera still living Some of them are now restricted to the tropics but their ranges formerly extended far to the north ward of their present limits In short birds afford no clear evidence in favor of the existence of a former Ant arctic continent and mammals only that af forded by the distribution of the Marsupials 319 Vertebrata of the Sea By THEO GILL Wash ington On account of the enforced absence of Dr Goode detained in Washington by official business and at his request Dr Gill con sidered the subject assigned to himthe fishes of the sea in relation to the Antarctic continent There is really no direct evidence fur nished by sea fishes bearing on the question at issue There are however some facts which may throw light on a certain phase of the question The fishes of the Antarc tic seas are very imperfectly known but the few that are known are of much interest and belong to two very distinct categories On one hand we have a few species be longing to a couple of families only occur ring in the extremely cold watersthe Chsenichthyids and Harpagiferids The genera of these families have been referred to the family of Trachinids but really mani fest no affinity to the typical forms of that group The only inference that appears to be derivable from the two families is that the supposititious Antarctic continent may have been in all Tertiary geological times at least deeply indented by extensions of the ocean far towards the Pole On the other hand in the Antarctic seas recur representatives of genera which have been only found in high northern waters such as Myxine Squalus and Merlucius and those representatives are so closely related as to have been united in two cases as con specific It appears to be most reasonable to postulate for such types derivation from a common source and that their extension may have been effected in the cold waters of the ocean depths It is more than pos sible that under favorable conditions spe cies of Myxine Squalus and Merlucius may yet be found in the cold deep waters below even equatorial seas for it is to be remem bered that all have an extensive bathymet rical range FEBRUARY 28 1896320 SCIENCE Another fact of interest and significance is that there are very few types of Gadids in the Antarctic or cold temperate seas Their place is taken by representatives of a family of acanthopterygian fishes appa rently related to the Chsenichthyids and Harpagiferids already mentioned the Not otheniids as they are called are of many closely related species and in their mode of occurrence and habits appear to be anala gous to the codfishes of the north Their distribution however does not throw the least light on the question of an Antarctic continent SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS ASTRONOMY THE Astronomisches Jahrbuch for 1898 has just been issued It is volume No 123 of the series and its preparation has been supervised by Dr P Lehman who was placed in temporary charge of the Berlin computing bureau after the death of Prof Tietjen THE Astronomical Journal of February 17th contains a determination of the elements of the orbit of the binary star F 99 Herculis by Dr T J J See The orbit obtained is very re markable because of the fact that the inclina tion comes out exactly zero It follows that we see the orbit just as it is instead of its being projected on the sky with more or less fore shortening Some uncertainty attaches to this interesting orbit however because a former orbit by Mr Gore and one by Dr See himself agree in making the inclination more than thirty degrees H J Nature states that at the last meeting of the Royal Astronomical Society the Astronomer Royal gave some particulars relating to the progress at Greenwich of the international pho tographic star catalogue A special staff for dealing with this work has been organized under Mr Hollis and already 130 of the plates taken for the catalogue have been measured It is estimated that 180 plates can be measured and 160 of them reduced in the course of a year so that at this rate the section allotted to Green wich comprising about 150000 stars will be N S VOL III No 61 completed in five or six years Assuming that the other sixteen coSperating observatories are proceeding equally well the world will soon be in possession of a colossal catalogue compris ing between two and three million stars EXTINCTION OF THE BUFFALO SECRETARY LANGLEY in his annual report just issued makes the following appeal for the preservation of the Buffalo in the National Park When the Yellowstone Park was organized it was believed that a permanent place of refuge for the buffalo had been secured andthat out of the natural increase of the hundreds then re maining representative herds would be pre served for future generations It seems now evident that the condition in the Yellowstone region are such that the extermination of the Government herd of buffalo may be anticipated and that it may be accomplished within a very short space of time The superintendent of the Park appears not to have adequate means for their protection and there are on the border plenty of persons whose respect for law is insuf ficient to keep them from poaching when the prize is a buffalo head or skin which will read ily sell for several hundreds of dollars The temptation to these men seems to be irresistible and as the herd diminishes the value of the animals increases and the difficulty of protec tion becomes constantly greater Since then the extermination of the Yellow stone herd seems rapidly approaching some thing should at once be done that this may not mean the extinction of the Government control of the species with the death of the few speci mens now in captivity Only one course sug gests itself as completely efficienttransference of the great part of the now few remaining ani mals to a region where they can be effectively protected and increase normally under natural conditions in which case the bison need not vanish from the face of the earth Two years ago there were supposed to be 200 in the Yel lowstone Park The present estimate is one quarter of that number The superintendent reports them as being  constantly pursued and in another year there may be none left If these animals or a majority of them can dur

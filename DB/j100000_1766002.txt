of fifty per cent efficiency with coal at same price as mentioned above allow ing for loss through radiation for day of twelve hours    12 cents Total cost    85 cents It will thus be seen that there is practically no differ ence between electricity and the ordinary cooking stove so far as cost is concerned and it is almost needless to point out the advantages of the electric oven over the cooking stove In the first place we have absolutely no dirt the elec trical oven being lined with porcelain enamel which can be cleaned with the greatest ease In the second we have practically no heat outside the oven to heat the room in summer Then we have absolute regulation of the temperature If the oven is cold and we require a temperature of say 100 degrees C to cook something the automatic regulator is set to 100 and in less than a minute the temperature has risen and remains exactly at that temperature Again if it is desired to only cook for a certain time say two hours the cutout is set for two hours and at the end of that time the current is either stopped entirely or is lowered so as to give any reduced temperature that may be desired In conclusion we may say that the electric oven is bound to come if only on the score of convenience and accuracy If cheapness were the only consideration we should still be burning tallow candles or gas but people and especially the American people will always decide in favor of what is most convenient so long as the differ ence in expense is not so great as to form a serious bur den and the above data will it is thought show that used in a proper manner the expense of electrical cook ing need not be seriously taken into account It will be seen that of every 100 tons of coal used in a cooking stove ninetysix tons are wasted It is difficult of course to get exact figures but it is probable that the waste in the city of New York alone is not far from 1000000 tons per annum With the electric stove though the cost does not greatly differ yet by far the larger proportion of the ex pense is due to the labor interest on plant and canal ization so that taking the efficiency of the boiler engine and dynamo as ten per cent the electrical oven for the same amount of useful calories uses only onefourth as much coal as the cooking stove and from a socialecon omical point of view is much to be preferred for the more we can live on the worlds interest which is labor and the less we draw from the worlds capital of fuel the better R A F MOUSE TRAPPING BY FRANK BOLLES CHOCORUA N H LATE in August the mice of our White Mountain woods fields and meadows begin to show an increasing interest in corn sweet apples and other kinds of bait usually used in effecting their capture In the early summer trapping them is slow work but the chill of autumn seems to stir them to fresh activity in the gathering of food and then pursuit of them becomes really interesting This year I am taking them alive in order to learn more about their hab its during the winter Where in previous years I have set the deadly little cyclone traps I am now setting the common wovenwire trap with a revolving wheel at tached For the ordinary whitefooted or deer mouse Sitomys americanus I have only to bait the trap with Vol XXII No 554 kernels of corn or a bit of sweet apple and place it at sunset near my wood pile or under the lumber heap back of my barn and the sound of the whirling wheel is soon heard For the longtailed gray whitefooted mouse Sitoenys americacnus canadensis I go to pine stumps in the woods or to the old logs on the shore of a pond far from houses and feel confident of taking him wherever I have previously found traces of his presence It is also easy to capture the shorttailed brown meadow mouse Arvicola pennsylvanicus who always seems to me as much like a diminutive bear as the whitefooted mouse is like a tiny deer His place of abode is readily detected for he makes long runways in the grass leading to the holes in the ground through which he reaches his burrow Sometimes I find him under a plank bridge which crosses a moist spot on the edge of the mowing land but oftener I trap him in the long matted meadow grass where his paths lead here and there in search of food or water As a rule I catch him in broad daylight when he is most active Evotrnys rutilus has a keen eye for protective colors I find him most frequently in dark damp woods remote from houses domiciled in hemlock stumps His chestnut fur matches the color of a decaying stump so closely that he seems like an animated portion of the red wood He does not however confine himself to the forest for T have caught at least one of his family close to my barn Neither does he limit his range to low land for I have secured specimens a thou sand feet above his favorite swamps By far the most beautiful of the New England wild mice is the jumping mouse of the woods Zapus insignis For him I walk back a mile from my house through lonely pastures and birch woods to a mountain stream which comes splashing over a rocky bed in a dark ravine It is not on the first or even the second day that he conde scends or dares to enter the trap although that danger ous engine is carefully covered and disguised with leaves ferns and bits of growing moss until it looks like a piece of the wild wood itself At first he eats the kernels of corn or the pieces of apple which are placed farthest from the trap Then night by night he comes nearer until at last having eaten all the corn and apple outside of dan ger limits he ventures too far and is caught Probably Zapus hudsonius the common jumping mouse is to be found in this vicinity but thus far I have not secured him although his cousin with the whitetipped tail might almost be called abundant A seventh species too well known in his customary resorts is Mus musculus the old world pest of the pantry Trapping mice in  cyclones often results in supply ing moles and shrews with food which they seem greatly to enjoy In fact Sitomys himself is only too willing to devour the tender portions of his own kindred B using the wheel trap and taking my mice alive I am not an noyed by the flesheaters SUBMARINE PHOTOGRAPHY BY JOHN HUMPHiREY LONDON ENGLAND SEVERAL of the difficulties experienced in endeavors to ascertain the natural relations of objects existing at con siderable depths under water have been overcome by M Louis Boutan in a remarkably ingenious manner and the contrivances he adopted are described in a recent com munication to the Paris Academy of Sciences He prefers to use a small camera in which several plates can be exposed consecutively and encloses this in a rectangular watertight metal box into the sides of which plates of glass are inserted to serve as windows The camera can be so disposed that the lens may face all the windows in turn if desired and exposures are reguSCIENCE lated from outside the metal case To avoid any ill effects that might be caused by differences in the internal and external pressure when the apparatus is sunk in deep water a kind of balloon filled with air is connected with it As the pressure increases in descending the balloon is compressed extra air is thus forced into the box and the pressure on its walls equalized A stout foot to support the apparatus and weights to sink it complete it for practical purposes In water near the shore not greatly exceeding one metre in depth the apparatus can be conveniently fixed without the operator needing to enter the water and by direct sunlight good negatives can be obtained in ten minutes When the water is deeper the operator must descend in diving costume to fix the case securely on its stand before commencing the actual work of photography In calm bright weather photographs can then be ob tained by direct sunlight in from thirty to fifty minutes Colored glasses preferably blue must be interposed be tween the objective and the water in order to obtain sharp images By the use of artificial light to illuminate the sur roundings however matters are still more simplified To this end Mi Boutan has contrived a special magnesium lamp A cask of two hundred litres capacity is filled with oxygen gas and on its upper end is fixed a spirit lamp which is covered by a bell glass A vessel contain ing magnesium in powder is connected with this lamp in such a manner that the metal can be projected across the flame by the action of a rubber ball which serves as bellows The oxygen gas of course is intended to assist combustion and the lamp having been lighted and cov ered by its protecting globe the cask simply requires weighting to sink it Good instantaneous negatives have thus been obtained by M Boutan during a violent storm when no daylight could penetrate the depths They are lacking as regards background but this he attributes to imperfections in the apparatus particularly the objective IIe also found it necessary to place before the lens a diaphragm of very small aperture to secure a sufficient degree of sharpness If a formula were calculated for an objective the front of which might be exposed to sea water he thinks these drawbacks might be remedied As it is he has proved that photographs can be taken in a brief time under water in calm weather by direct sunlight at depths up to six or seven metres whilst by the use of his special lamp they can be taken instanta neously at any depth that can be conveniently reached by a diver and the state of the weather is of no importance THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF COMPOSITION BY DR CHARLES H J DOUGLAS BOYS HIGH SCHOOL BROOKLYN THE end of literary composition is effective communi cation To this end there are necessary first something to communicate and second some means of communica tion The only thing to be communicated is thought The medium of communication is language One cannot then expect to understand the philosophy of literary composition without investigating both the nature and the process of handling both thought and language Psychologists recognize three distinct kinds of thought viz the concept the judgment and the argument The concept the simplest form of thought may be defined as the act of mind by which we merely become aware of something Objectively considered the concept is indi visible and unrelateda kind of intellectual atom The simple judgment a more complex form of thought than the concept may be defined as the act of mind by which we apprehend an agreement or disagreement between two I49 concepts Objectively considered the judgment is a complex unit resolvable into its constituent partsa kind of intellectual molecule The argument the most complex form of thought is commonly regarded as differing essentially from both the concept and the judgment It is however in the last analysis nothing else than a complex judgment It may be defined as the act of mind by which we apprehend an agreement or a disagreement between two concepts by apprehending an agreement or a disagreement between each of them and a third concept The relation of logic to composition is peculiar and quite likely to be misapprehended The formation of judgments upon a subject must of course precede the communication of thought upon that subject But the formation of judgments upon a subject is nothing else than the study of that subject it is not composition That process begins with the selection of judgments al ready formed and it ends so far as the handling of thought is concerned with the arrangement of them ac cording to a certain recognized principle At this point then the mind begins a new process Ceasing for the moment to form judgments about the subject of the communication it begins to form judg ments about those judgments in order to the process of discourse This may be defined as the selection and the arrangement of judgments with a view to the greatest mental effect in apprehending them Thus while the formation of a set of judgments about the subject of the communication and of another set of judgments about the first set are both processes implied by the process of composition neither of them is included in that process Again the mind in the formation of judgments about its own judgments in order to dis course is subject to the laws of logic no less than it is in the formation of judgments about the subject of the communication The relation of logic to composition is therefore seen to be both vital and complex But while the mind in the formation of judgments about its own judgments in order to discourse is subject to the laws of logic yet the principles according to which the selection and the arrangement of the judgments are made are not principles of logic but of dialectic This may be defined as the science of effective thought as logic is the science of correct thought So important are the selection and the arrangement of judgments in the effective handling of thought that it has sometimes been said that what the judgment is to the concept and what the argument is to the judgment such is method to the argument and that consequently a fourth division is necessary to complete the doctrine of logic Both the premise and the conclusion of this state ment are however untenable It is evident that method does not sustain the same re lation to the argument that the argument does to the judgment and that the judgment does to the concept first because the argument does not sustain the same re lation to the judgment that the judgment does to the concept and second because method is of precisely as much importance in simple discourse where there are no arguments at all as it is in reasoning where there is nothing except arguments The importance of method instead of arising from some relation which it is supposed to sustain to the argu ment depends entirely upon the principle of the economy of the recipients attention By selection the waste of his energy in the formation of irrelevant or unimportant judgments is avoided By arrangement the greater sus ceptibility of his mind at certain points in the timeseries of cognitions which he makes and to certain sequences of judgments is taken advantage of September 15 I893

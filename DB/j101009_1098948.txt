j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1098948,The Parents Liability for Necessaries Furnished His Minor Child,i245879,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL VI JANUARY 1901 No 9 THE PARENTS LTA RTTTTY FOR NECESSARIES FURNTtH mn HIS MINOR CTTTTn Few topics in the law have been subject to so much loose thinking and obscure statement as the question of the extent of the parents liability for necessaries furnished his child by a third person and in none have the dicta of the courts been more rampant and misleading Textwriters and judges have united in working needless confusion by bringing into the discussion of the commonlaw principles involved the moral law natural law and the civil law and then confounding the mixture with the provisions of 43 Elizabeth and the equitable doctrine of maintenance out of the childs estate Furthermore the theme is one which even in the leatherbound pages of the law is apt to be sicklied oer with pale sentiment whether finding expression in the thin declamation of some later writers on Domestic Relations or in the stately eloquence of Sir William Blackstone The natural re sult of such methods of treatment is to be seen in the inconsistent and incoherent statements which are grouped under this heading in the textbooks encyclopedias and digests and denominated law The purpose of this paper is an attempt to free the subject from the encum brance of irrelevant doctrines and by assimilating the cases determine the commonlaw principles upon which the liability of the parent for necessaries furnished his child may properly be based First it must be noted that the cases in which the liability of the pa rent is based upon contract made through the agency express or implied of the child and those in which his liability arises out of a legal duty to support the child are grounded upon wholly different principles It is true the action is in assumpsit in each case but in the first case the obligation is one intentionally and willingly assumed by the father while in the second the obligation is imposed by the law quite against the will of the father The wife so long as she has not by her own wrong forfeited her right to claim support from her husband is re586 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan garded as his agent by mere operation of law and may bind him by her contracts for the purchase of necessaries even though he expressly forbids such purchase1 But the authorities2 with little dissent3 deny that a similar agency exists by virtue of the relation of parent and child and it should necessarily follow that the child cannot bind the parent in contract unless expressly or impliedly authorized to do so While on account of the relation between them authority from the father to the child will be more readily implied than to a stranger yet the real or apparent giving of authority is no less necessary to enable the child to bind the parent in contract Different jurisdictions may differ as to the existence of a legal duty on the part of the parent to support the child yet all must admit his liability upon his childagents contracts Even the English cases which vehemently deny the existence of the legal duty go very far in accepting almost shadowy evidence to prove an agency4 Further the legal duty if it exists extends only to the infant child while the liability in contract may quite as well exist in the case of supplies furnished an adult child5 With this necessary and patent distinction between these two grounds of liability in mind one is surprised to find such a statement as the following in Porter v Powell6  Without further citation of authorities we announce as our conclusions that it is the legal as well as moral duty of parents to support their children during minority that a parent cannot be charged for necessaries furnished by a stranger for his minor child except upon an express or implied promise to pay for the same and that such promise may be inferred on the grounds of the legal duty imposed One can scarcely make an intelligent guess as to what is the principle upon which the above conclusions are based The facts in the case were that the seventeenyearold daughter of the defendant who had been for three years absent from her home receiving and expending her own wages fell sick and procured the plaintiff to render her pro fessional services The defendant knew nothing of his daughters

way to hold that any promise to pay was made by the father is to regard the daughter as his agent in the premises by whose promise he was bound But the facts wholly negative any sort of agency there being present no ele ment of previous knowledge or consent or of subsequent ratification Yet the court after declaring that there rested upon the father a legal duty to supply the daughter with necessaries which alone would have been amply sufficient to render him liable to one who had furnished such necessaries proceeds to deny any such liability except in contract and for lack of such contract forthwith creates one out of the dis carded legal and moral duty Similarly confusing statements of the law growing out of a failure to discriminate clearly between the parents liability arising out of contract and that based on his legal duty to support are frequently seen in both texts and reports Thus Schouler in his work on Do mestic Relations section 241 writes There can be no doubt that a parent is under a natural obligation to provide necessaries for his minor children But how that obligation is to be enforced is not so clear  In fine either anl express promise or circumstances from which a promise by the father can be inferred is essential I LIABILITY IN CONTRACT It now becomes important to determine when the law implies authority on the part of the child to bind the parent in contract For if the agency be once established the father is obliged to pay for arti cles purchased by the child whether they be necessaries or not and whether the child be infant or adult Further if the child have authority to make the contract of purchase the parent is liable in the absence of fraud or imposition for the contract price and not merely for what the supplies are reasonably worth as would be the case if the infant bought on his own credit or if the supplies were fur nished the infant without contract In case of liability in contract fori supplies furnished the child the widowed mother would be equally liable with the father2 arid under the present Virginia statute Acts 18991900 p 1240 even during coverture if she had given the child authority express or implied to make the purchase There is some authority for holding that the child is the parents 1 Thayer v White 12 Met 343 Harper v Lemon 38 Ga 227 2 Girls Industrial Home v Fritchey 10 Mo App 344 1901 PARENT S LIABILITY 5876 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER agent for the purchase of necessaries by virtue of the mere relation existing between them as in the case of husband and wife that the law will imply the agency from the legal duty1 to support the child Some courts even have held that a moral duty to support is sufficient to raise the contract of agency irrespective of the consent of the parent But the great weight of authority and the better reason repudiate this doctrine of imputed agency and apply the general rule making the father liable in contract only when he has previously as sented to or subsequently ratified the purchase made by the child But this assent may be either express or implied  and from the inti mate relation of parent and child and the custom of parents to supply their infant offspring with necessaries the law will much more readily imply the parents willingness to be bound by the childs contract for the purchase of necessaries than if the parties were strangers or the articles supplied not necessaries4 Therefore very slight evidence will be sufficient to establish such an agency and imply a promise on the part of the parent to pay for the necessaries supplied5 Thus knowl edge without dissent that the child has made a purchase will be evidence of a ratification of the contract by the parent6 So if the parent has formerly paid for goods purchased on credit by his child and does not forbid such sales it will be inferred that the parent authorizes further purchases on credit7 And where the father has ratified the former contracts of his child buying goods on credit by paying money due under them he will be liable it is held for subse quent purchases made by the child even though he forbids his child to contract further debts and even though he is given in charge to a friend who is supplied with all moneys needful to procure necessaries for the child provided the person furnishing the supplies acts in good faith and without a knowledge of the provision made by the father8 Mere silence9 on the part of the parent may imply authority given Thus where the plaintiff by letter informed the defendant that goods had been sold to his son it was held that the fathers failure to answer 1 Tompkins v Tompkins 11 N J Eq 512 Allen v Jacobi 14 I11 App 277 2 Porter v Powell 79 Ia 151 7 L R A 176 3 See note 2 supra 4 Crane v Baudouine 55 N Y 256 Mills v Wymnan 3

evidence of an intent to ratify the purchase So if authority to purchase is clearly proved the parent will be liable for goods furnished the child even when such goods are not necessaries2 In the English case of Law v Wilkins the Court of Kings Bench held that when a son away from home at school had without the knowledge of his father bought clothes of which he stood in need and had taken these clothes with him when he went home although it did not appear that the father had ever seen them the question of authority to the child to make the purchase should have been left to the jury and that a nonsuit was erroneous A similar ruling was made in Blackburn v Mackey4 But in the later case of Mortimore v Wright5 Lord Abinger declared these cases were not law and stated broadly that the father could not be held liable for the debts of his infant son unless he had done some specific act from which it could be inferred that he had authorized the purchase But the father cannot be held liable upon the contract of the child when the goods furnished are charged to the child6 and not to the father nor when the son is absent from home and supplied by the father with necessaries or money to purchase necessaries unless the father has paid bills previously made or otherwise indicated his wil lingness that the son should use his credit7 Neither can the father be charged with debts incurred by his son who lives away from his fathers home conducting his own affairs and retaining his own earnings even when the father has requested that credit be given his son8 and cer tainly when the son leaves home for the purpose of escaping domestic discipline or for other improper cause he does not take with him authority to pledge the fathers credit9 Thus while some of the courts seem to hold that an agency for the purchase of necessaries by the child will be implied from the mere existence of the relation of parent and child it may be seen that the better considered authorities hold that the father is liable for debts in curred in the purchase of necessaries by the child only when the supplies 1 Thayer v White 12 Met 343 Deane v Annis 14 Me 26 2 Harper v Lemon 38 Ga 227 3 6 Ad

be inferred from all the circumstances attending the transaction And among the facts to be considered in drawing such inference are the relationship of the parties and the fact that parents usually supply or intend to supply their infant offspring with the necessaries of life II LIABILITY ARISING FROM DUTY However difficult its application to the individual cases that may arise the principle of the parents liability in contract for the neces saries furnished his child is plain and simple But this is far from being the case with regard to the liability arising from the mere duty resting on the parent to support the child Granting that such a duty of maintenance exists it is exceedingly difficult to determine upon what legal basis it should be made to rest In his effort to fix such a basis one is little aided by the cases confused as they are as to prin ciples involved and rendered painfully uncertain by the rank growth of dicta which seem to spring up in unusual luxuriance from the rich soil of sentiment and humanitarianism which surrounds such questions in a peculiar degree Dictum always sufficiently dangerous is ren dered peculiarly so in these cases involving the maintenance of chil dren by reason of the statute of 43 Elizabeth Ch 2 in England and statutes of similar import in the various States of the American Union which often come into the judges mind when they do not properly come into the case But before attempting to formulate any state ment of law as to when the parent is thus liable for necessaries fur nished the child it will be necessary first to determine as well as may be what the cases have decided as to the nature and extent of the parents duty to maintain the child 1 The English doctrine In view of Section 2 of the Code of Virginia declaring the common law of England to be the law of this State we naturally look to the English cases as affording the most satisfactory means of determining what is the common law in regard to the question under discussion To quote the characteristic words of Mr Bishop The habit of the judicial mind in this country is always to inquire what is the present English doctrine upon every question presented to itnot that the doctrine is always followed but there is always a certain satisfaction in knowing what it is But unfortunately the English cases afford us little aid or comfort in the present matter Until long after the time when English decis 1 1 Bishop on the Law of Married Women sec 848 590 Janions ceased to be binding as precedents upon American courts the doctrine of parental liability for necessaries furnished the child was in more hopeless confusion in Westminster Hall than at present in the various American courts Blackstone1 speaks of the parents duty of maintenance as plain both in morals and in law but it is clear that he had in mind the statutory provisions of 43 Eliz Several early cases2 intimate entirely aside from the point up for decision that the parent is under a legal obligation to support his child and as late as 1827 Lord Tenterden in Nichols v Allen3 said There is not only a moral but a legal obligation on the defendant to maintain his child In that case the father was held liable on an implied contract to pay to the plaintiff who had supported his illegitimate child the sum he had been accustomed to pay for the same purpose during previous years The statement quoted was therefore purely obiter but the fact that so great a judge as Lord Tenterden should give forth such a dictum is sufficient evidence of the uncertainty of the law at that time This confusion seems to have continued until 1840 when the case of fMortimore v Wright came before the Court of Exchequer for decis ion Here the son of the defendant in his twentieth year had left home whether with or without the consent of his father does not ap pear and was working on his own account and receiving his own wages For many months he paid the plaintiff for board and lodging out of his own money Some six months before attaining his majority the boy fell ill and was unable to pay for the care and necessary sup plies with which the plaintiff still continued to furnish him For the value of these necessaries the plaintiff sought to hold the father liable The lower court gave judgment for the plaintiff upon a finding by the jury that the defendant had authorized the son to incur the debt On appeal the Exchequer court might easily have contented itself with making absolute the rule to enter a nonsuit on the ground that there was no evidence to go to the jury on the point of authority but Lord Abinger thought fit to go quite out of his way to say I am the more desirous to make the rule absolute to that extent in order that there may be no uncertainty as to the law upon this subject In point of law a father who gives no authority ani enters into no contract is no more liable for goods supplied to his son than a brother or an uncle 11 Blackstone Corn 447 2

This language is certainly as positive as a judge could make it but it would have more convincing force if it had been necessary to the decision It seems that the facts in the case clearly show that the son was emancipated and it is scarcely prob able that many of the American courts would hold the father liable under similar circumstances1 In Bazeley v Forder Cockburn C J said in a dissenting opin ion It is now well established that except under the operation of the poor law there is no legal obligation on the part of the father to maintain his child unless indeed the neglect to do so should bring the case within the criminal law Civilly there is no such obligation The majority of the court however decided that the father was liable for necessaries furnished his son at the order of the mother who was living rightfully apart from her husband with the child in her cus tody by order of court This decision was based upon an implied authority in the wife to bind the husband for such supplies as were necessary to her comfortable existence among which was a reasonable provision for the child in her keeping If the same case should come up in an American court it would be decided in precisely the same way From these and numerous other English cases4 of similar import which cannot be here set forth it is seen that while it may be regarded as settled law in England that the parent is not liable for necessaries furnished his minor child it is settled in a most unsatisfac tory way being the result of a procession of aggressive dicta rather than of a series of reasoned decisions We must further note that the English doctrine has been powerfully influenced by the provisions of 43 Elizabeth which were constantly in the minds of the judges as sup plementing in effect the deficiencies of the harsh rules laid down by them as the common law This famous statute which was old enough to be a part of the common law of Virginia until abolished by the Act of 1792 has been substantially enacted in many of the States of the American Union but not in Virginia As originally adopted it read as follows 1 Varney v Young 11 Vt 258 Gotts v Clark 78 Ill 229 But see Porter v

enacted that the father and grandfather and the mother and grandmother and the children of everie poore olde blinde lame and impo tente person or other poore person not able to worke beinge of a

suche sufficient persons dwell or the greater number of them at their generall quarter sessions shall be assessed upon paine that everie one of them shall forfeite twentie shillings for everie monethe which they shall faile therein It is easily seen that this statute was enacted for the benefit of the public to prevent its being required to support such paupers as had near lineal relatives able to maintain them In other words it is but a part of the general poor law and in no sense declaratory of a princi ple of common law requiring the parent to support his child It can be invoked only in aid of the public and never for the benefit of the child1 Finally we may note the following peculiarities of the English doctrine that the parent owes the child no legal duty of suppart 1 It is a doctrine announced by the English judges and n properly derived from the decisions of the English courts 2 It cannot be regarded as fixing the common law in Virginia as it was itself unsettled prior to 1840 3 It has a strange companion in the criminal law A father is criminally liable for neglecting to support his child2 yet it is difficult to understand how one can be punished for a failure to do what he is under no legal obligation to do 2 Doctrile in the United States generallyAlthough the American lecisions are not less embarrassingly rich in obiter dictum than the English and despite the great apparent conflict in the holdings of our numerous courts of last resort yet it may be safely said that accord ing to the American authorities a father is under a legal obligation to maintain his minor child irrespective of statute This is strenuously denied in many cases4 which profess to follow the English authorities but as is well shown in Prof Liles Notes to 1 Minors Institutes l See Rawlins v

the legal duty of support on the part of the father in the sweeping form they sometimes assume were unnecessary in the decisions of the cases which on the facts are in each case found not inconsistent with the general doctrine above stated That such a legal duty of support is recognized in the United States cannot well be called in question in view of the great mass of authority both of reported decisions and legal treatises that so state the law Yet it is eeceedingly difficult to find a single case in which the father has been flatly and pointedly held liable to pay for necessaries furnished his minor child by reason of his mere duty to maintain such child So averse do the courts seem to enforcing the bare legal obligation that they base their decisions upon implied contract in cases in which no contract could possibly be implied from the facts sometimes assuming the remarkable attitude of denying the existence of the obligation apart from a promise to pay and then implying the promise from the obliga tion to pay Yet in deciding that when a divorced wife is awarded custody of the children the husband may be required to make suitable provision for both wife and children 2 or that a father cannot subject the estate of his infant child to reimburse him for expenses incurred in the maintenance and education 8 of the child the courts have taken needless pains to announce that the father is legally hound to support his child From an examination of the cases containing these announcements we perceive the anomalous spectacle of the English and American courts deciding cases presenting similar facts in prac tically the same way but the former taking occasion to declare that the father is not obliged in law to support his child and the latter asserting that such maintenance is a plain legal duty But it will be observed that while the American cases declare the father liable for necessaries furnished his minor child yet they nar rowly limit this liability so as in no way to deprive the father of his right to control his own children and to determine what supplies shall be furnished them In fact it is believed that this liability exists only in three cases See Liles Notes to 1 Minors Inst 242 1 When the child lives with the father a stranger furnishing him with necessaries can charge the father with payment for them only when the father has been guilty of a clear and palpable omission to 1 Porter v Powell dutpra 2 Gilley v Gilley 79 Me 292 Pretzinger v Pretzinger 45 Ohio St 452 Stanton v Wilson 3 Day 37 3 Ecans v Pearce 15 Gratt 513 Richardson v Overleese Tex 44 S W 308 594 JanPARENT S LIABILITY make such provision for his child as may be necessary to preserve the childs life and health1 In such a case the word necessaries has not the same meaning as in the ordinary case of infants contracts but includes only such articles as may keep the child from actual want and suffering 2 When the child is absent from home having been driven there from by the wrong of the father the latter has deprived himself of the right to determine what articles shall be supplied to his child and he will therefore be required to compensate any stranger who furnishes the child with the necessaries that should have come from the fathers hands8 And it seems that the scope of the word necessaries  should be broader in this case than when the child lives with his father4 But if the child has left home of his own wrong5 through impatience of parental control or to escape the consequences of a wrongful act he has forfeited his right to receive support and a stranger supplying him with necessaries must either look to the infant or rejoice in his own charity 3 When the child is absent from home by the command of the father if the father has neglected to make provision for the childs wants a third person supplying such wants may recover from the father the reasonable value of the articles furnished6 But if the child has been emancipated from parental control and receives his own wages7 or if he is absent though with the consent of his father upon business of his own8 it seems that a stranger affording him support can make no claim against the father It would seem reasonable that when the father sends his child away from home without making provision for supplying his needs while absent he by implication authorizes the child to purchase such articles as might prove necessary to him according to the circumstances From that point of view the person furnishing the necessaries might 1 Owen v White 5 Port 435 Rogers v Turner 59 Mo 116 Van

contract rather than on the ground of mere legal duty and it has been so held1 Such holding would reduce the cases in which a father is liable by reason of mere duty to a third person for necessaries furnished his child to two only as first set out above It is often stated even in those jurisdictions in which the legal duty of support on the part of the father is recognized that no such duty rests upon the mother2 This is clearly true during the life of the father but doubtful when the mother is a widow entrusted with the custody of her children and having ability to support them Granted her ability there seems to be no valid reason why the widowed mother should not be equally liable with the father and such seems to be the prevailing rule3 3 The doctrine in VirginiaThe question of parental liability for necessaries furnished a minor child has never come before the Virginia Court of Appeals but from the consistent and positive character of the dicta to be found in numerous Virginia cases it is probable that the general American doctrine will be adhered to in this State although some doubt is cast upon this conclusion by the contrary opinion of the learned author of Tuckers Blackstone4 Judge Tuckers opinion however was formed upon the assumption that the settled rule of the English common law denied such liability on the part of the father which as has been shown was inaccurate Judge Green also seems to have had some doubt as to the law on this point for we find him saying in Myers v Wade For there is a natural if not a legal obligation on all parents to support their children if of ability to do so But in Evans v Pearce6 Robertson J says A father if of ability is bound to maintain his infant children even though they may have property of their own This statement is positive enough but unfortunately it was unnecessary under the facts of the case The sole question to be decided was whether the estate of a deceased father should be allowed credit for the support and education of his children out of the income of their property The court very properly held Shelton v Springett 11 C B 452 Owen v White supra 2 1 Minors Inst 407 Fairmount etc Ry Co

such allowance could be made without the clearest proof that justice requires it This decision is in strict accord with the settled rule both in this country and in Englandl that no allowance out of the childs estate will be made to the father of adequate means for ex penses incurred for the support and education of the child The doc trine does not rest upon the fathers legal duty to maintain the child which as we have seen is expressly denied in England but rather on the wellestablished fact that fathers usually support and educate their children without any expectation of reimbursement Therefore if the father expects compensation from his childs estate for money expended in his support and education he must make his desire known to the court and first secure an order authorizing such an application of the childs property That the fathers legal duty of support was not properly involved in the decision of Evans v Pearce may further be seen from the fact that no allowance was made for the education of the children and if the dictum quoted above had been the ground of decision we might have expected a statement that a legal duty to edu cate his child rests upon the parent Yet no courts have yet gone so far Furthermore it has been held that a stepfather standing in locoparentis to a child cannot receive credit for support and education from the estate of the child though it is well settled that a stepfather owes no duty of support to his stepchild But this dictum in Evans v Pearce has been reechoed in numerous subsequent Virginia cases2 and with unquestioning approval In the recent case of Owens v Owens3 in affirming an award of alimony to a divorced wife retaining custody of her children the court announced that the father was  under a legal obligation to support his wife and children  An English court would readily have granted such an award though it is improbable it would have made the remark quoted But however little binding force such dicta may possess they indi cate clearly what is the opinion of the bench and there can be little doubt that when the case fairly arises it will be decided that a stranger furnishing a minor child with necessaries may charge the father with the value of them in accordance with the general American rule stated above See1 Minors Inst 409 Schouler Dom Rel sec 238 Such allowance without previous decree

190116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER III SUMMARY By way of summary the conclusions reached may be stated as follows 1 The obligation on the part of the parent to pay for necessaries furnished his minor child may have its origin in contract or in legal duty 2 The liability in contract is distinct in nature and extent from that arising from legal duty 3 The liability in contract exists only when the parent has ex pressly or by implication conferred authority upon the child to bind him in contract and such authority will not be implied from the mere relation of parent and child or from any duty moral or legal arising therefrom 4 The English courts recognize no liability on the part of the father save in contract 5 The American courts generally in addition to the liability in contract enforce an obligation to support arising from the mere rela tion of the parent to the child provided always that the right of the parent to control his children and regulate his household is not im paired thereby 6 While the question has not been decided in Virginia there can be little doubt but that when it does arise it will be decided in accord ance with the general American rule W R VANCE

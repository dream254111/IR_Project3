FURNTTH MN HIS MINOR CTTTTN FEW TOPICS IN THE LAW HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO SO MUCH LOOSE THINKING AND OBSCURE STATEMENT AS THE QUESTION OF THE EXTENT OF THE PARENTS LIABILITY FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED HIS CHILD BY A THIRD PERSON AND IN NONE HAVE THE DICTA OF THE COURTS BEEN MORE RAMPANT AND MISLEADING TEXTWRITERS AND JUDGES HAVE UNITED IN WORKING NEEDLESS CONFUSION BY BRINGING INTO THE DISCUSSION OF THE COMMONLAW PRINCIPLES INVOLVED THE MORAL LAW NATURAL LAW AND THE CIVIL LAW AND THEN CONFOUNDING THE MIXTURE WITH THE PROVISIONS OF 43 ELIZABETH AND THE EQUITABLE DOCTRINE OF MAINTENANCE OUT OF THE CHILDS ESTATE FURTHERMORE THE THEME IS ONE WHICH EVEN IN THE LEATHERBOUND PAGES OF THE LAW IS APT TO BE SICKLIED OER WITH PALE SENTIMENT WHETHER FINDING EXPRESSION IN THE THIN DECLAMATION OF SOME LATER WRITERS ON DOMESTIC RELATIONS OR IN THE STATELY ELOQUENCE OF SIR WILLIAM BLACKSTONE THE NATURAL RE SULT OF SUCH METHODS OF TREATMENT IS TO BE SEEN IN THE INCONSISTENT AND INCOHERENT STATEMENTS WHICH ARE GROUPED UNDER THIS HEADING IN THE TEXTBOOKS ENCYCLOPEDIAS AND DIGESTS AND DENOMINATED LAW THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS AN ATTEMPT TO FREE THE SUBJECT FROM THE ENCUM BRANCE OF IRRELEVANT DOCTRINES AND BY ASSIMILATING THE CASES DETERMINE THE COMMONLAW PRINCIPLES UPON WHICH THE LIABILITY OF THE PARENT FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED HIS CHILD MAY PROPERLY BE BASED FIRST IT MUST BE NOTED THAT THE CASES IN WHICH THE LIABILITY OF THE PA RENT IS BASED UPON CONTRACT MADE THROUGH THE AGENCY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED OF THE CHILD AND THOSE IN WHICH HIS LIABILITY ARISES OUT OF A LEGAL DUTY TO SUPPORT THE CHILD ARE GROUNDED UPON WHOLLY DIFFERENT PRINCIPLES IT IS TRUE THE ACTION IS IN ASSUMPSIT IN EACH CASE BUT IN THE FIRST CASE THE OBLIGATION IS ONE INTENTIONALLY AND WILLINGLY ASSUMED BY THE FATHER WHILE IN THE SECOND THE OBLIGATION IS IMPOSED BY THE LAW QUITE AGAINST THE WILL OF THE FATHER THE WIFE SO LONG AS SHE HAS NOT BY HER OWN WRONG FORFEITED HER RIGHT TO CLAIM SUPPORT FROM HER HUSBAND IS RE586 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN GARDED AS HIS AGENT BY MERE OPERATION OF LAW AND MAY BIND HIM BY HER CONTRACTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF NECESSARIES EVEN THOUGH HE EXPRESSLY FORBIDS SUCH PURCHASE1 BUT THE AUTHORITIES2 WITH LITTLE DISSENT3 DENY THAT A SIMILAR AGENCY EXISTS BY VIRTUE OF THE RELATION OF PARENT AND CHILD AND IT SHOULD NECESSARILY FOLLOW THAT THE CHILD CANNOT BIND THE PARENT IN CONTRACT UNLESS EXPRESSLY OR IMPLIEDLY AUTHORIZED TO DO SO WHILE ON ACCOUNT OF THE RELATION BETWEEN THEM AUTHORITY FROM THE FATHER TO THE CHILD WILL BE MORE READILY IMPLIED THAN TO A STRANGER YET THE REAL OR APPARENT GIVING OF AUTHORITY IS NO LESS NECESSARY TO ENABLE THE CHILD TO BIND THE PARENT IN CONTRACT DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER AS TO THE EXISTENCE OF A LEGAL DUTY ON THE PART OF THE PARENT TO SUPPORT THE CHILD YET ALL MUST ADMIT HIS LIABILITY UPON HIS CHILDAGENTS CONTRACTS EVEN THE ENGLISH CASES WHICH VEHEMENTLY DENY THE EXISTENCE OF THE LEGAL DUTY GO VERY FAR IN ACCEPTING ALMOST SHADOWY EVIDENCE TO PROVE AN AGENCY4 FURTHER THE LEGAL DUTY IF IT EXISTS EXTENDS ONLY TO THE INFANT CHILD WHILE THE LIABILITY IN CONTRACT MAY QUITE AS WELL EXIST IN THE CASE OF SUPPLIES FURNISHED AN ADULT CHILD5 WITH THIS NECESSARY AND PATENT DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE TWO GROUNDS OF LIABILITY IN MIND ONE IS SURPRISED TO FIND SUCH A STATEMENT AS THE FOLLOWING IN PORTER V POWELL6  WITHOUT FURTHER CITATION OF AUTHORITIES WE ANNOUNCE AS OUR CONCLUSIONS THAT IT IS THE LEGAL AS WELL AS MORAL DUTY OF PARENTS TO SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN DURING MINORITY THAT A PARENT CANNOT BE CHARGED FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED BY A STRANGER FOR HIS MINOR CHILD EXCEPT UPON AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED PROMISE TO PAY FOR THE SAME AND THAT SUCH PROMISE MAY BE INFERRED ON THE GROUNDS OF THE LEGAL DUTY IMPOSED ONE CAN SCARCELY MAKE AN INTELLIGENT GUESS AS TO WHAT IS THE PRINCIPLE UPON WHICH THE ABOVE CONCLUSIONS ARE BASED THE FACTS IN THE CASE WERE THAT THE SEVENTEENYEAROLD DAUGHTER OF THE DEFENDANT WHO HAD BEEN FOR THREE YEARS ABSENT FROM HER HOME RECEIVING AND EXPENDING HER OWN WAGES FELL SICK AND PROCURED THE PLAINTIFF TO RENDER HER PRO FESSIONAL SERVICES THE DEFENDANT KNEW NOTHING OF HIS DAUGHTERS

OR ADULT FURTHER IF THE CHILD HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE THE CONTRACT OF PURCHASE THE PARENT IS LIABLE IN THE ABSENCE OF FRAUD OR IMPOSITION FOR THE CONTRACT PRICE AND NOT MERELY FOR WHAT THE SUPPLIES ARE

THE GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY AND THE BETTER REASON REPUDIATE THIS DOCTRINE OF IMPUTED AGENCY AND APPLY THE GENERAL RULE MAKING THE FATHER LIABLE IN CONTRACT ONLY WHEN HE HAS PREVIOUSLY AS SENTED TO

INFANT OFFSPRING WITH NECESSARIES THE LAW WILL MUCH MORE READILY IMPLY THE PARENTS WILLINGNESS TO BE BOUND BY THE CHILDS CONTRACT FOR THE PURCHASE OF NECESSARIES THAN IF THE PARTIES WERE STRANGERS OR

THEY DO NOT PROPERLY COME INTO THE CASE BUT BEFORE ATTEMPTING TO FORMULATE ANY STATE MENT OF LAW AS TO WHEN THE PARENT IS THUS LIABLE FOR NECESSARIES FUR NISHED THE CHILD IT WILL BE NECESSARY FIRST TO DETERMINE AS WELL AS MAY BE WHAT THE CASES HAVE DECIDED AS TO THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE PARENTS DUTY TO MAINTAIN THE CHILD 1 THE ENGLISH DOCTRINE IN VIEW OF SECTION 2 OF THE CODE OF VIRGINIA DECLARING THE COMMON LAW OF ENGLAND TO BE THE LAW OF THIS STATE WE NATURALLY LOOK TO THE ENGLISH CASES AS AFFORDING THE MOST SATISFACTORY MEANS OF DETERMINING WHAT IS THE COMMON LAW IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION UNDER DISCUSSION TO QUOTE THE CHARACTERISTIC WORDS OF MR BISHOP THE HABIT OF THE JUDICIAL MIND IN THIS COUNTRY IS ALWAYS TO INQUIRE WHAT IS THE PRESENT ENGLISH DOCTRINE UPON EVERY QUESTION PRESENTED TO ITNOT THAT THE DOCTRINE IS ALWAYS FOLLOWED BUT THERE IS ALWAYS A CERTAIN SATISFACTION IN KNOWING WHAT IT IS BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE ENGLISH CASES AFFORD US LITTLE AID OR COMFORT IN THE PRESENT MATTER UNTIL LONG AFTER THE TIME WHEN ENGLISH DECIS 1 1 BISHOP ON THE LAW OF MARRIED WOMEN SEC 848 590 JANIONS CEASED TO BE BINDING AS PRECEDENTS UPON AMERICAN COURTS THE DOCTRINE OF PARENTAL LIABILITY FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED THE CHILD WAS IN MORE HOPELESS CONFUSION IN WESTMINSTER HALL THAN AT PRESENT IN THE VARIOUS AMERICAN COURTS BLACKSTONE1 SPEAKS OF THE PARENTS DUTY OF MAINTENANCE AS PLAIN BOTH IN MORALS AND IN LAW BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT HE HAD IN MIND THE STATUTORY PROVISIONS OF 43 ELIZ SEVERAL EARLY CASES2 INTIMATE ENTIRELY ASIDE FROM THE POINT UP FOR DECISION THAT THE PARENT IS UNDER A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT HIS CHILD AND AS LATE AS 1827 LORD TENTERDEN IN NICHOLS V ALLEN3 SAID THERE IS NOT ONLY A MORAL BUT A LEGAL OBLIGATION ON THE DEFENDANT TO MAINTAIN HIS CHILD IN THAT CASE THE FATHER WAS HELD LIABLE ON AN IMPLIED CONTRACT TO PAY TO THE PLAINTIFF WHO HAD SUPPORTED HIS ILLEGITIMATE CHILD THE SUM HE HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO PAY FOR THE SAME PURPOSE DURING PREVIOUS YEARS THE STATEMENT QUOTED WAS THEREFORE PURELY OBITER BUT THE FACT THAT SO GREAT A JUDGE AS LORD TENTERDEN SHOULD GIVE FORTH SUCH A DICTUM IS SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE LAW AT THAT TIME THIS CONFUSION SEEMS TO HAVE CONTINUED UNTIL 1840 WHEN THE CASE OF FMORTIMORE V WRIGHT CAME BEFORE THE COURT OF EXCHEQUER FOR DECIS ION HERE THE SON OF THE DEFENDANT IN HIS TWENTIETH YEAR HAD LEFT HOME WHETHER WITH OR WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF HIS FATHER DOES NOT AP PEAR AND WAS WORKING ON HIS OWN ACCOUNT AND RECEIVING HIS OWN WAGES FOR MANY MONTHS HE PAID THE PLAINTIFF FOR BOARD AND LODGING OUT OF HIS OWN MONEY SOME SIX MONTHS BEFORE ATTAINING HIS MAJORITY THE BOY FELL ILL AND WAS UNABLE TO PAY FOR THE CARE AND NECESSARY SUP PLIES WITH WHICH THE PLAINTIFF STILL CONTINUED TO FURNISH HIM FOR THE VALUE OF THESE NECESSARIES THE PLAINTIFF SOUGHT TO HOLD THE FATHER LIABLE THE LOWER COURT GAVE JUDGMENT FOR THE PLAINTIFF UPON A FINDING BY THE JURY THAT THE DEFENDANT HAD AUTHORIZED THE SON TO INCUR THE DEBT ON APPEAL THE EXCHEQUER COURT MIGHT EASILY HAVE CONTENTED ITSELF WITH MAKING ABSOLUTE THE RULE TO ENTER A NONSUIT ON THE GROUND THAT THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE TO GO TO THE JURY ON THE POINT OF AUTHORITY BUT LORD ABINGER THOUGHT FIT TO GO QUITE OUT OF HIS WAY TO SAY I AM THE MORE DESIROUS TO MAKE THE RULE ABSOLUTE TO THAT EXTENT IN ORDER THAT THERE MAY BE NO UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE LAW UPON THIS SUBJECT IN POINT OF LAW A FATHER WHO GIVES NO AUTHORITY ANI ENTERS INTO NO CONTRACT IS NO MORE LIABLE FOR GOODS SUPPLIED TO HIS SON THAN A BROTHER OR AN UNCLE 11 BLACKSTONE CORN 447 2

OPIN ION IT IS NOW WELL ESTABLISHED THAT EXCEPT UNDER THE OPERATION OF THE POOR LAW THERE IS NO LEGAL OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE FATHER TO MAINTAIN HIS CHILD UNLESS INDEED THE NEGLECT TO DO SO SHOULD BRING THE CASE WITHIN THE CRIMINAL LAW CIVILLY THERE IS NO SUCH OBLIGATION THE MAJORITY OF THE COURT HOWEVER DECIDED THAT THE FATHER WAS LIABLE FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED HIS SON AT THE ORDER OF THE MOTHER WHO WAS LIVING RIGHTFULLY APART FROM HER HUSBAND WITH THE CHILD IN HER CUS TODY BY ORDER OF COURT THIS DECISION WAS BASED UPON AN IMPLIED AUTHORITY IN THE WIFE TO BIND THE HUSBAND FOR SUCH SUPPLIES AS WERE NECESSARY TO HER COMFORTABLE EXISTENCE AMONG WHICH WAS A REASONABLE PROVISION FOR THE CHILD IN HER KEEPING IF THE SAME CASE SHOULD COME UP IN AN AMERICAN COURT IT WOULD BE DECIDED IN PRECISELY THE SAME WAY FROM THESE AND NUMEROUS OTHER ENGLISH CASES4 OF SIMILAR IMPORT WHICH CANNOT BE HERE SET FORTH IT IS SEEN THAT WHILE IT MAY BE REGARDED AS SETTLED LAW IN ENGLAND THAT THE PARENT IS NOT LIABLE FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED HIS MINOR CHILD IT IS SETTLED IN A MOST UNSATISFAC TORY WAY BEING THE RESULT OF A PROCESSION OF AGGRESSIVE DICTA RATHER THAN OF A SERIES OF REASONED DECISIONS WE MUST FURTHER NOTE THAT THE ENGLISH DOCTRINE HAS BEEN POWERFULLY INFLUENCED BY THE PROVISIONS OF 43 ELIZABETH WHICH WERE CONSTANTLY IN THE MINDS OF THE JUDGES AS SUP PLEMENTING IN EFFECT THE DEFICIENCIES OF THE HARSH RULES LAID DOWN BY THEM AS THE COMMON LAW THIS FAMOUS STATUTE WHICH WAS OLD ENOUGH TO BE A PART OF THE COMMON LAW OF VIRGINIA UNTIL ABOLISHED BY THE ACT OF 1792 HAS BEEN

SUPPORT THEIR CHILDREN IF OF ABILITY TO DO SO BUT IN EVANS V PEARCE6 ROBERTSON J SAYS A FATHER IF OF ABILITY IS BOUND TO MAINTAIN HIS INFANT CHILDREN EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY HAVE PROPERTY OF THEIR OWN THIS STATEMENT IS POSITIVE ENOUGH BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT WAS UNNECESSARY UNDER THE FACTS OF THE CASE THE SOLE QUESTION TO BE DECIDED WAS WHETHER THE ESTATE OF A DECEASED FATHER SHOULD BE ALLOWED CREDIT FOR THE SUPPORT AND EDUCATION OF HIS CHILDREN OUT OF THE INCOME OF THEIR PROPERTY THE COURT VERY PROPERLY HELD SHELTON V SPRINGETT 11 C B 452 OWEN V WHITE SUPRA 2 1 MINORS INST 407 FAIRMOUNT ETC RY CO

SUCH ALLOWANCE COULD BE MADE WITHOUT THE CLEAREST PROOF THAT JUSTICE REQUIRES IT THIS DECISION IS IN STRICT ACCORD WITH THE SETTLED RULE BOTH IN THIS COUNTRY AND IN ENGLANDL THAT NO ALLOWANCE OUT OF THE CHILDS ESTATE WILL BE MADE TO THE FATHER OF ADEQUATE MEANS FOR EX PENSES INCURRED FOR THE SUPPORT AND EDUCATION OF THE CHILD THE DOC TRINE DOES NOT REST UPON THE FATHERS LEGAL DUTY TO MAINTAIN THE CHILD WHICH AS WE HAVE SEEN IS EXPRESSLY DENIED IN ENGLAND BUT RATHER ON THE WELLESTABLISHED FACT THAT FATHERS USUALLY SUPPORT AND EDUCATE THEIR CHILDREN WITHOUT ANY EXPECTATION OF REIMBURSEMENT THEREFORE IF THE FATHER EXPECTS COMPENSATION FROM HIS CHILDS ESTATE FOR MONEY EXPENDED IN HIS SUPPORT AND EDUCATION HE MUST MAKE HIS DESIRE KNOWN TO THE COURT AND FIRST SECURE AN ORDER AUTHORIZING SUCH AN APPLICATION OF THE CHILDS PROPERTY THAT THE FATHERS LEGAL DUTY OF SUPPORT WAS NOT PROPERLY INVOLVED IN THE DECISION OF EVANS V PEARCE MAY FURTHER BE SEEN FROM THE FACT THAT NO ALLOWANCE WAS MADE FOR THE EDUCATION OF THE CHILDREN AND IF THE DICTUM QUOTED ABOVE HAD BEEN THE GROUND OF DECISION WE MIGHT HAVE EXPECTED A STATEMENT THAT A LEGAL DUTY TO EDU CATE HIS CHILD RESTS UPON THE PARENT YET NO COURTS HAVE YET GONE SO FAR FURTHERMORE IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT A STEPFATHER STANDING IN LOCOPARENTIS TO A CHILD CANNOT RECEIVE CREDIT FOR SUPPORT AND EDUCATION FROM THE ESTATE OF THE CHILD THOUGH IT IS WELL SETTLED THAT A STEPFATHER OWES NO DUTY OF SUPPORT TO HIS STEPCHILD BUT THIS DICTUM IN EVANS V PEARCE HAS BEEN REECHOED IN NUMEROUS SUBSEQUENT VIRGINIA CASES2 AND WITH UNQUESTIONING APPROVAL IN THE RECENT CASE OF OWENS V OWENS3 IN AFFIRMING AN AWARD OF ALIMONY TO A DIVORCED WIFE RETAINING CUSTODY OF HER CHILDREN THE COURT ANNOUNCED THAT THE FATHER WAS  UNDER A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN  AN ENGLISH COURT WOULD READILY HAVE GRANTED SUCH AN AWARD THOUGH IT IS IMPROBABLE IT WOULD HAVE MADE THE REMARK QUOTED BUT HOWEVER LITTLE BINDING FORCE SUCH DICTA MAY POSSESS THEY INDI CATE CLEARLY WHAT IS THE OPINION OF THE BENCH AND THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT WHEN THE CASE FAIRLY ARISES IT WILL BE DECIDED THAT A STRANGER FURNISHING A MINOR CHILD WITH NECESSARIES MAY CHARGE THE FATHER WITH THE VALUE OF THEM IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GENERAL AMERICAN RULE STATED ABOVE SEE1 MINORS INST 409 SCHOULER DOM REL SEC 238 SUCH ALLOWANCE WITHOUT PREVIOUS DECREE

190116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER III SUMMARY BY WAY OF SUMMARY THE CONCLUSIONS REACHED MAY BE STATED AS FOLLOWS 1 THE OBLIGATION ON THE PART OF THE PARENT TO PAY FOR NECESSARIES FURNISHED HIS MINOR CHILD MAY HAVE ITS ORIGIN IN CONTRACT OR IN LEGAL DUTY 2 THE LIABILITY IN CONTRACT IS DISTINCT IN NATURE AND EXTENT FROM THAT ARISING FROM LEGAL DUTY 3 THE LIABILITY IN CONTRACT EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE PARENT HAS EX PRESSLY OR BY IMPLICATION CONFERRED AUTHORITY UPON THE CHILD TO BIND HIM IN CONTRACT AND SUCH AUTHORITY WILL NOT BE IMPLIED FROM THE MERE RELATION OF PARENT AND CHILD OR FROM ANY DUTY MORAL OR LEGAL ARISING THEREFROM 4 THE ENGLISH COURTS RECOGNIZE NO LIABILITY ON THE PART OF THE FATHER SAVE IN CONTRACT 5 THE AMERICAN COURTS GENERALLY IN ADDITION TO THE LIABILITY IN CONTRACT ENFORCE AN OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT ARISING FROM THE MERE RELA TION OF THE PARENT TO THE CHILD PROVIDED ALWAYS THAT THE RIGHT OF THE PARENT TO CONTROL HIS CHILDREN AND REGULATE HIS HOUSEHOLD IS NOT IM PAIRED THEREBY 6 WHILE THE QUESTION HAS NOT BEEN DECIDED IN VIRGINIA THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT BUT THAT WHEN IT DOES ARISE IT WILL BE DECIDED IN ACCORD ANCE WITH THE GENERAL AMERICAN RULE W R VANCE

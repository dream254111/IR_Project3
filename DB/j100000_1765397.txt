j100000,Science,1765397,The Vegetable Fibres of Trinidad,i300774,THE VEGETABLE FIBRES OF TRINIDAD THE United States consul in Trinidad has recently forwarded to the government a report upon the vegetable fibres of that island and gives a description of some of the most important of them The maholtine is a plant which grows wild in large quantities It is easily cultivated by simply cutting down bushes and burning them and scattering the seeds of the plant One acre of good ground will produce about five thousand pounds of stalk and this stalk reduced to fibre will make about eight hundred pounds The stalk grows from eight to twelve feet the skin or bark of which is stripped off and steeped in cold water eight or ten days after which the green watery substance is washed out leaving a fibre eight to ten feet long The white mahoe Sterculia caribaea likie the maholtine grows wild and may be cultivated in the samre way producing the same quality of fibre The fibre is whiter and more silky than that of the maholttie and is believed to be superior to it although it has never been sent abroad to test its merits A crop is reaped every seven montlhs The gumbo or okra Abelmosehus esculentus is another stalk fibre the plant growing six to eight feet high and producing a fibre about the same length Cultivated on good soil it will pro duce four thousand pounds of stalks yielding as much fibre to the pound as the maholtine or the white mahoe The fibre of the gumbo unlike those above mentioned will not contain water but throws it off like oil silk A crop is harvested every seven mnonths The plantain Mlusa sapientum will produce frotm five to six pounds of fibre to each stalk The stalks grow from eiglht to nine feet high and eight hundred of them my be produced on an acre of ground The fibre is obtained bv putting on two wooden rollers and rolling and squeezing the stalks to crush the watery pores then steeping it in water eight to ten days and finally putting it under the same rolling process with heavier weights The banana Musa paradisiaca grows four to five feet high produces two to three pounds of fibre to the stalk and eight hun dred stalks to the acre and the crop is annual Ramie or Chinagrass grows very thickly and when once planted sustains itself against other grass After the first year it can be cut every six months The stalk grows about four feet high It will produce an ounce of fibre to every square foot The plant was imported into Trinidad from China for experimental purposes about three years ago and has not yet assumed any commercial importance The rnahoe bord du mer Paritium tiliaceum does not grow inland but on the seashore It is a stalk fibre but unlike the above it branches and the branches also produce fibre It grows eight to fifteen feet high Each tree will produce about half a pound of fibre and one acre can support eight hundred trees Red mahoe terculia caribca grows wild on any soil of the island produces about eight hundred trees to the acre grows eight to ten feet high and then branches The stalk and branches are both used for fibre which is used by the natives for mak ing rope The crop is annual Rucon or annotto an Indian plant from South America is a very strong fibre One acre will support eight hundred stalks cultivated on fertile soil and each stalk will produce about half a pound of fibre Black sage Ciordia cylendros is a small shrub about six feet high and produces a very strong fibre used by the natives for making ropes An acre of ground will support sixteen hundred plants and they will give onefourth of a pound of fibre to each plant Bois sang or bloodwood grows twentyfive feet high and branches out eight to ten feet from the bottom When tapped the tree emits a fluid resembling blood which produces a red stain Both stem and branches produce fibre About six hun dred trees may be produced to the acre and each tree will produce two to three pounds of fibre which is used for ropemakiing The fibre varies from four to six feet in length is very tough and would it is said make a superior twine for bagging It is cut and planted every three years Balizier Hilicomea is a wild plant grows on cool soil and its presence indicates superior land  The blades which resemble the blades of the plantain produce the fibre but the blades grow from the roots of the bush like a pineapple and they are six to ten feet long One acre will produce about ten thousand blades and each blade will produce half an ounce of fibre It is a coarse fibre not so strong as the others mentioned but is useful for door mats and similar purposes Cacao Theobroma is cultivated for its valuable fruit but the tree which grows fifteen or twenty feet high is trimmed annually in the spring of the year and the branches of each tree thus trimmed will produce half a pound of fibre which varies fromti three to five feet in length It is strong and is used as rope for making hammocks Bois lome Guazuma ulmifolia is a straight tree At a dis tance of eight or ten feet up the body of the tree five or six branches shoot out in a circle round it and from this point to the top of the tree encireling branches shoot out at the distance of about one foot apart The lowest circle of branches are the longest and they shorten as they ascend the tree causing the tree to assume the shape of a sugarloaf Both the body and branches produce fibre It is a straight brown fibre and very strong used generally for rope and twine making Eight hundred trees may be pr6diced to the acre and after the third year will producee annually from one to two pounds of fibre to the tree The Agave Mexicana grows three or four feet high and oneAPRIL 3 i89i SCIENCE i85 acre will support twentyfive lhundred plants After three years each blade will produce half an ounce or about half a pound to the plant The crop may be reaped each succeeding year for from twelve to sixteen years without replanting The plant becomes dry and worthless as soon as it produces a flower but it rarely produces the flower before twelve years and usually not before sixteen or twenty years The plant grows wild on the island but it is understood to have originally been brought from Mexico The fibre is three to four feet long fine strong and it is said would doubtless be good for textile purposes The Agave Americana or A tnerican aloe grows higher than the Agave Mexicana It varies in height fromn four to five feet and the fibre is the same length It grows abundantly chiefly near the seashore and is understood to be a native of the island The fibre is coarser than the Mexican agave but about the same quan tity can be produced to the acre Of the pineapple Ananassa sativa only the blade which is about two feet long produces fibre The fibre is strong and fine and is believed to be wellsuited for textile manufactures It is of finer texture than either the American or Mexican agave Agave rigida or sisal hemp has lately been introduced into Trinidad The blades alone which grow about two and a half to three feet long are used for fibre Eight blades it is said give an ounce and a half of fibre and the fibre obtained is about thlee feet long strong coarse and stiff suitable it is believed for strong ropes and chairbottoms An acre will support two thousand plants of about sixteen blades each and calculated to produce at each reaping three ounces of fibre to the plant After three years a crop is reaped annually Among the fibreproducing plants of Trinidad may be mentioned the gemove Malachra bois ceip Oreodaphne cernua Gumbo mizse the pinquine or wild pine apple the Spanish needle Yucca and the Saniseviera zeylanica Consul Peirce states in conclusion that he has been informed that there is no machine now in use in the colony which obtains the fibre without destroying the substance of the fibreribs The principal miachine if not the only one now used in Trinidad and Tobago is arranged for the operator to hold the blade of the plant in his hand while the machine scrapes out the green and watery substance The opinion has been expressed that if a machine could be introduced that would act somewhat on the principle of a canemill in which the cane enters one side and comes out at the other thoroughly crushed and squeezed a great advantage would be gained over the present practice

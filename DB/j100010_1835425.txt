j100010,The American Historical Review,1835425,The Share of America in Civilization,i304877,THE SHARE OF AMERICA IN CIVILIZATION Gentlemtiien of the University of TYisconisin Once going from Europe to Brazil I heard at table an English writer a great Eastern traveller the late William Gifford Palgrave ask the captain of the ship what good he thought had come from the discovery of America For his part he cotuld not see any ex cept for tobacco That was the first time I heard that doubt ex pressed but years afterwards I happened to buy an old French book by an Abbe Genty with this title LIiiflteice de la Decouverte de lAnierique sur le Bonheur dut GenreHmnaitn and I saw that the cturious question had been seriously proposed for a prize by the Academy of Lyons before the French Revolution This is how it was formulated  Has the discovery of America been useful or prejudicial to mankind The work is on the whole an empty declamation in which there is nothing to reap except the hope of the writer in the regeneration of mankind through the newborn American nation He foresees in the inde pendence of the AngloAmericans to quote his words the event most proper to accelerate the revolution which will bring back happiness upon earth   It is in the bosom of this newborn Republic  he adds  that are deposited the true treasures which will enrich the world That makes the book worth preserving But I787 when the essay was written was too early a date to treat the subiect of the contribution of the New World to the welfare of mankind I787 was already the dawn of Americas day but only the dawn George Washington was President of the Constittu tional Convention but the influence of the great event beyond its impact on the Old World which lhad not yet produced the French Revolution could not then be imagined There is in the life of the nations a period in which the role assigned to them has not yet been revealed The character of the Roman influence could not be foretold even during the great days of the Republic A talk between Cicero and Caesar about the part of Gaul or of Britain in history would nlot take into consideration France or England while one between Charlemagne and Alcuin I Baccalaureate address Madison June 20 i909 by His Excellency the Brazilian Ambassador ED  54The Share of America in Civilizalion 55 about the part of Germany would be only a tale of the MIiddle Ages now nearly forgotten Even today who could say anything essential regarding the part of Japan or of China Japan can be said to be in her dawn for the outside world while China continues veiled in her long night shining for herself alone Who can even imagine what will be the record of either in the history of mankind But it is no longer too early to study the share of America in civil ization We do not know her possibilities in the future as we do not know those of electricity but we know already what electricity is and so with your national individuality we know already what it is Nations reach at a certain time their full growth as individ ualities you seem to have reached yours We are therefore better prepared to speak of it than was the French abbe on the eve of the French Revolution I had already chosen this fascinating subject when my atten tion was called to the admirable address of President Eliot on it years ago pointing out five great American contributions to civiliza tion These were in his words first and principal the substitution of discussion and arbitration for war as the means of settling dis putes between nations second the widest religious toleration third manhood suffrage fourth the demonstration of the fitness of a great variety of races for political freedom fifth the diffusion of material wellbeing among the population I do not think all the points claimed as American contributions by President Eliot will bear in history the markmade in America but I think all of them have passed through such transformation and improvement here that they all deserve in part that mark Still we must be as careful not to write the history of civiliza tion without taking into account the rest of mankind as we should be not to write it without America The American race is not a race born of a sudden in an advanced state of civilization It was in the time of the countrys formation the English race only brought up in different surroundings and now it is the product of the fusion under its predominance of that race with other races Most probably the destiny of mankind would in the end be the same if America had never appeared above the water still without it much that has been already added to civilization would not yet exist and perhaps never would just as without a certain grouping of circumstances the artistic florescence of the Renaissance might never have bloomed When we look for what belongs properly to America we must not comprise in her part what belongs to the English race nor I56 Joaquim Nabuco will add to other races forming the American nationality although in the leading part played by this country one cannot yet well discern the influence of any race but the one from which it originally pro ceeded All that belongs to the natural evolution of the Anglo Saxon civilization should not be ascribed to America only A fruit is not special to a tree because it ripens earlier on it in some part of the world Fruits really American are those which are only produced by American trees whether in their own continent or transplanted abroad although I would not hesitate to call American the fruits of those European trees which in their native soil are meagre and undeveloped and which acquire in the American soil a much stronger sap Having this in view I would not for instance count manhood suffrage as an American contribution to civilization It cannot be said that England or the world depended at all on the United States for the conception and the development of manhood suffrage Uni versal suffrage is not even associated generally with America it is rather associated with France Nor would I count arbitration I do not think arbitration was born in this country Proselytizing for peace is more the interest of nations threatened by war than of one protected against it In the last years there has been a strong peace movement in America but it has followed the European peace movement Europe being the continent threatened by war needs a greater activity for peace But President Eliot in summing up his address refers to that contribution in other words as peace keeping Expressed in that form I have no doubt it has been one of your mightiest contribu tions to civilization because the peace pressure from America on Europe is the greatest pressure weighing on the world to keep down war America thanks to the Monroe Doctrine is the Continent of Peace and this colossal peace unit interesting deeply other re gions of the earththe whole Pacific one might sayforms a neutral hemisphere and balances the other hemisphere which we might call the belligerent hemisphere Still we must remember that wars have generally come from obstacles to national aggrandizement and that yours has never met with any serious obstacle You are carrying out now thanks to the confidence in your neutral character as well as to your prestige a work that would be resisted as one nations concern by the other seapowers if undertaken by any other nation With your pro digious growth your peace sentiment will have to be tested when your national aggrandizement meets with the first serious obstacleThe Share of America in Civilization 57 The question is if you then would not proclaim the holy national war As yet no one could say that peace is a permanent article of faith with you such as are democracy and religious toleration for in stance The great good fortune of mankind is that the period of your unopposed growth permitting you to live in peace and to exercise your great moral and commercial pressure for peace coin cides with the time when the progress of civilization and probably that of science also will succeed in substituting international law for war or in detaching war from international law of which it still makes the principal part Allow me to say that I believe that nothing would do more to fix on the mind of this great nation the purpose of peace than Pan Americanism Once PanAmericanism were made her determined foreign policy as it has already been with the Monroe Doctrine a reflex movement of hers not only would she wed herself to peace but she would also wed to it the rest of the continent and that task would fill the time still necessary for mankind to disavow war Peace and PanAmericanism are convertible terms for you and for us But as what gives the greatest strength to your power for peace is immigration I would classify immigration as the greatest of all contributions of America to civilization Allow me a few remarks on this point You are a nation in some respects of a unique type The only one approaching that type was the Roman Empire when near dissolution Every other nation is or was composed of a race or of separate races speaking each its own language you are a nation formed by the fusion of races of different languages brought by superior inducements to speak only the hereditary language of the country In other words your are a nation formed of nations by their own will Here lies all the difference you are formed by free immigration not by conquest America is really the NewEurope but while the old Europe maintains its race barriers by a different patriotism different national traditions and different languages here in NewEurope all those same European races mingle intermarry lose memory of their old allegiances change the old European soul for the new American one and as this fusion takes place in millions of people you are a nation whose ethnical formula varies at every generation The racial components of your nationality change so rapidly their relative proportions that one could never say how they really stand to each other Fortunately your national consciousness has not to adjust itself to the census it does not wait for the analysis of the race it contents itself with the unalterable synthesis which is American58 joaquim Nabuco Strange to say it is this everchanging ethnical composition that keeps up your individuality since this consists more than anything else of the spirit breathed on you at your creation and the new accessions wherever they hail from assimilate eagerly and protudly that spirit as their chief birthright With the constant influx of newcomers the useless inert or decayed national residuum does not appear so much as it would if there were no new elements to make up for the waste There is indeed in every society a sediment formed of those parts in which the primitive national spirit has buirnt itself out at least partly and which by themselves would not be fit to preserve and to continue the countrys indi viduality Any aristocracy in America would be a sediment of that kind I do not mean that fine patina of time which by figuration we call  aristocracy  In this sense time everywhere is naturally aristocratic There have been nations formned by conquest and composed also of different races but among the latter particularism was always predonminant and they were kept indefinitely apart from each other When the ancient world was reduced to Roman provinces and after Caracalla had extended the right of citizenship to all the free inhabitants of the empire the world saw a community in the style of yours all its members claiming through pride the same nation ality but those were times of great dissension and besides the fusion of the different races could not proceed so unimpeded as with you owing to the many barriers of ancient local life This is the first and greatest influence I would point out of the discovery of America on civilization the appearance on earth of an immense continent destined to be the new home of the old Euro pean races where they would meet and mix and speak the same language while in the native soil their old stocks would continue separated and up till now belligerent In other words a fact never seen or imagined before of a mankind a new mankind formed by selfselection The American nation was created by the sentiment of country it was devotion to the native country together with the feeling of freedom and independence that led the colonists to break their ties with the old mothercountry But American democracy which from the beginning gave to the pride of country a greater force has grown to its present size by voluntary change of their national allegiance on the part of millions Choosing ones own country is a right that would not be generally acknowledged before this country created it and made it acceptable to the worldThe Sare of America in Civilization 59 Before the American spirit started immigration the greatest human migration was the slavetrade the covering of America by manstealth with African slaves The contrast between immigra tion and the slavetrade is enough to show what a regenerating part the American spirit has had in the march of civilization No page certainly is more brilliant in the whole history of England than her fight against the African slavetrade when America was willingly filling herself with those of the kidnapped negroes who were not thrown overboard but after all what killed the slavetrade and slavery was immigration Immigration not slavery represents the true American sap Although Europe had nobly rid herself of slavery thanks to Christianity slavery was her colonial policy in the New World slavery marked the period of European coloniza tion and continued as a legacy from the colonial times after the Independence Immigration on the contrary is characteristically American the attraction of free wide and growing America on the dense human layers of Europe That attraction broke in Europe the old stratifications created centrifugal forces For the first time in history immigration gave men and women of all nationalities a chance of transplantation of trying life in more favorable circum stances it destroyed what remained of a dungeonlike character in the old national barriers by making country a wholly voluntary allegiance in a word it upset forever the foundations of despotism of practical serfdom by rendering the people everywhere free to move away from it I consider immigration the greatest force in modern civilization and there is no doubt that it is an American force After immigration I would name democracy Democracy is also distinctly American Although an English growth in America it is different from the European growth and has long reacted against the monarchical spirit of the English race American his tory is kingless as European history is royal The spirit of liberty which was characteristically AngloSaxon growing on a land with out any monarchical tradition took the form of democracy or republic Certainly there are elements fundamentally English in the American democracy as there are others that are GrecoLatin One cannot break the chain that binds through history the evolu tion of an idea or of a sentiment but the American democracy is genuinely new a new design the ancients did not produce it nor would Europe have produced it So you can claim it for America as a contribution to civilization not because the Republican govern ment could be called a higher form of civilization than the nion6o Joaquim Nabuco archical Parliamentary government but because by its competition and by the silent lesson of immigration it has exercised the most beneficent influence on the liberal evolution of the monarchical gov ernment in Europe You can claim that you have transformed with your democracy not only the monarchical system of Europe but her colonial methods of government as well Democracy has a character of finality which monarchy has not even expunged of all spirit of divine right although the final form of democracy may yet be government by the best man as was the Greek ideal Some maintain like Professor Miinsterberg in his criticism of President Eliots address that your democracy came from Europe from the philosophy of the eighteenth century But the inspiration of that philosophy as far as liberty is concerned went largely from the New World Nothing more strongly influenced Jean Jacques Rousseau than the impression of the New World The French utopists of the eighteenth century did not take much from the dis covery of India China and Japan but the discovery of America was a creative impression for them as during three centuries it was for their predecessors No less a mind than Montaigne for instance will say of the American natives writing in the sixteenth century I regret that Lycurgus and Plato did not know them as it seems to me that what we see by experience among those nations not only surpasses all the pictures with which poetry has embellished the Golden Age and all its inventions in imagining a happy condition of men but also the conception and even the wish of Philosophy    How distant from this perfection would Plato find his Republic 2 The whole Social Contract of Rousseau is implicit in this chapter of the Essays two centuries older It is a permanent and growing impression of centuries that which the free born New World produced on the European mind only to be re placed by the other commanding and also constantly growing im pression of the American democracy after your independence A book could be written on those two successive influences of the New World on the European imagination Another very great contribution which I would like to mention is the equality of social conditions among all classes of the nation That is what most struck Alexis de Tocqueville When I survey he wrote this countless multitude of beings shaped in each others likeness amidst whom nothing rises and nothing falls the sight of such universal uniformity saddens and chills me But this fragment does not do justice to his feelings as he ends by 2 Liv I ch XXXiThe Share of America in Civilization 6i paying homage to the great principle of equality The fact that Tocqueville ends his survey of America as he had begun it shows that the greatest impression produced on him was the general equality of conditions That is the greatest impression it will pro duce on anyone This is the explanation why it has become the adoptive country the elected home of men of all races born and reared under the contrary principle of inequality Just as Asia had her castes Europe had her orders or classes In America there is not between the different calls of life any difference of level and this simple idea this true social egg of Columbus has made the success of this nation transforming it from a people of one single stem as it began into a people of many stems all giving the same fruit But equality did not make only the success of this nation it fixed the final type of human society everywhere Like immigra tion like democracy equality is final and finality is in everything the greatest possible contribution to progress For many people the idea of civilization will always correspond to the greatest development of art But from the aesthetic point of view there is no such thing as progress in the modern world because if some arts have advanced others on the contrary have retroceded To put it in one single remark the many countries round the Mediterranean the Ionian and the zEgean seas must have all presented an incomparably more beautiful sight in the days of Hadrian or of Constantine the Great than in our days in the same proportion at least as the Greece described by Pausanias to the Greece of Baedeker You must not look for human progress in art In art let us be retrogrades of the times of Phidias of Euainetos of Vinci of Beethoven And as in art so in poetry Poetry will never more equal mythology There is yet more poetry in the piece of land which the last earthquake of Messina has con vulsed than in all the rest of the world present or future To renew the supply of poetry of the earth nothing less would be necessary than the communication with some other planet That would indeed be a renewal of mans imagination infinitely greater than was the very great one of the discovery of America Yes if I were asked of what good America was to Europe I would say that Columbus cut large doors and windows on the west side of the old European manorhouse which received its ventilation only from the East America has regenerated the Old World since the sixteenth century as effectually as the influx from Central Europe regenerated it in the Middle Ages The pity was that the means of navigation were not greater in the time of the Roman Empire62 Joaquim Nabuco and that the discovery was not made then so as to have preserved the ancient civilization But with regard to art there is no doubt that there is a distinct American trait While the English is solid and the French graceful yours is cleancut There is an American perfection as character istic as the Japanese which I believe is well defined by the word cleancut  Civilization should be essentially the improvement of the social condition of mankind but we had better call civilization the increase of the intellectual power of man as the increase of the intellectual power could alone lead to a permanently satisfactory social condi tion that is to a condition based on truth and entrusted entirely to freedom I do not believe that America is yet leading in the in crease of the intellectual power of man that is of science but I believe that it is already leading in the improvement of mans social condition I do not say alone but with a few other nations which look chiefly to you The idea of civilization has been up till now associated with individual initiative in landed property with the system of small estates more than with the latifundia in trade and industry more with competition than with concentration But there is evidently now in progress an evolution in the sense of unification that can be called American Great nationalities cosmopolitan trains fast boats aeroplanes cables wireless telegraph Hague Conferences all seem to announce that the new tendency of mankind in every direction is the  merger  In theory centralization seems to assure the better service of so many millions of people just as the cold storage assures their better feeding by saving incalculable quantities of food which formerly would decay in the same day but there are too many points to be considered in centralization political and social and only experience will shed any light over them For the moment no one can say whether the new American political economy is or is not one of the great contributions of this country to civilization The universities of America are watch towers admirably prepared to follow the progress of the economical evolution and to solve in time the riddle of the Sphinx One thing is sure the age of Franklin will not end as the age of Midas How can one refrain from mentioning among your greatest con tributions to mankind your system of education The American education seems the only one that is not wholly conventional that is not a pure galvanization of states of mind of other ages of the ideals of men who feed their mind and their heart on books instead of feeding them on the sights and wants of their own times YouThe Share of America in Civilization 63 alone give as the greatest of all human teachings selfreliance And a boon new to mankind you teach selfreliance not only to men but to women There never existed in the world such a youth of both sexes with the same training for life You plunge them from childhood in a bath that gives to both the strength and the elasticity of steel You have changed the rhythm of life you write it in quick tempo and the world is catching from you the spirit of rapid transformation and is writing it also in the American prestis simo instead of the old adagio Among your great contributions to civilization President Eliot rightly counts your great inventions still as science is universal inventions are generally suggestions from the work of other people and those achieved by you would certainly have come out sooner or later with the progress of science What has come from you in opposition to the general modern tendency is your respect for woman the place you have made for her among mankind together with the strong current of pure thought which you oppose to the literature of sensualism flourishing among other races Certainly asceticism in the monastic times and chivalry in the Middle Ages show well enough that Europe is capable of engendering the strongest currents of purity even yours is probably only a survival of English Puritanism kept alive under more favorable conditions but with regard to purity of thought towards woman the present leadership of the world belongs indeed to America Gentlemen I did not intend mentioning all the contributions of this country to civilization Their complete cataloguing would be a most gigantic task it would certainly comprise your great con tributions to international law I only meant to give you a few impressions on the usefulness of America beyond tobacco Here is how an English observer who with Alexis de Tocque ville will remain one of the two classics of the ninetenth century on American democracy the Right Honorable James Bryce por trays the American people I only put together the different features he has traced of you According to him you are a good natured a kindly a humorous a hopeful an educated a moral and a wellconducted people your average of temperance chastity truthfulness and general probity is somewhat higher than in any of the great nations of Europe you are a religious people every thing among you tends to make the individual independent and self reliant you are a busy people and a commercial people you are impressionable capable of an ideality surpassing that of English men or Frenchmen you are an unsettled people nobody feeling rooted to the soil yet an associative and a sympathetic people you64 Joauiuim Nabuco are a changeful people but not a fickle one only growing warm suddenly and cooling as suddenly you are a conservative people prosperity serving to make you more so3 In a word he says summing tup his whole work America marks the highest level not only of material wellbeing but of intelligence and happiness which the race has yet attained I think such a portrait in the gallery of nations even were some of its touches overflattering which I do not think is in itself a contribution to civilization After it a remark seems necessary Until now no European race has given in America exactly the same intellectual fruit as in its native soil just as the French grapevines transplanted here will never give the same exquisite wines There is no sign that the intellectual hegemony is passing from Europe to America Europe has not begun to decay and we must remember that the forming of new ideals like Christianity for instance was many times the work of ages of decay just as with certain fruits is the spread of seeds America could not carry out the same work as Europe There is an intellectual geography as there is a botanical or a zoological geography The intellectual qualities of each leading race are different and it would diminish the power of effort in this country were it ever to feel assured that it had surpassed Europe There is inspiration in the hope but the victory itself wotuld be the beginning of retrocession Mankind must remain greater than any of its parts in all that makes the glory of civilization and the children should not surpass the fathers in their lifetime For many centuries Europe and America will lead together Speaking of America I have all the time taken the part for the whole and talked only of this country It is rather early to speak of the part assigned in history to Latin America We have not yet been ordered to enter the stage the plays of God are very long ones his acts are ages Up to now we have done however a considerable work of civilization against great difficulties and I believe that nowhere could be selected finer types of man and woman than among our different nations We hope we do honor to our native stocks and that we show compared to them traits of the same evolution as you present compared to the English race Many ideals in the world are in part at least sustained by our faith without its ever being noticed owing to our retiredness but more than once there has been a surprise in the world when men from Latin America came to the front as in the last Council of the Vatican or in the Second Hague Conference or as when Santos 3 Amnerican Commonwealth pt IV ch LXXXThe Share of America in Civilization 65 Dumont flying around Paris opened the era of aerial navigation Sometimes we appropriate the progress of civilization in a manner that they from whom it originated find too thorough for themselves No constitution for instance except that of Brazil provides that war shall only be authorized by the National Congress in case of arbitration being impossible4 and no other contains such an article as its article 88  The United States of Brazil in no case will enter into a war of conquest either directly or indirectly either alone or allied to another Power Similarly the abolition of war for debt will be in international law a laurel surrounding the name of the Argentine Republic But we feel great pride in recognizing the sons of Washington as the molders of our American civilization Gentlemen I thank President Van Hise for the very great honor of asking me to address your university which stands in the front row of American universities I take it as the best sign that the Continental feeling is already firmly rooted in this stronghold of American individuality JOAQUIM NABUCO Constitution of February 24 i891 article 34 paragraph ii

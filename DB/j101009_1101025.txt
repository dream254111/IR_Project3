Corporation Law that no foreign stock corporation doing business in this State shall maintain an action on a contract made here unless prior thereto it had procured a certificate from the Secretary of

Florida in July 1905 39 So 398 it was held that an act requiring street car companies to provide separate compartments in their cars for the Caucasian and African races and that under penalties prohibits persons of either of said races from occupying the compartment of a car set apart for the other race but with the proviso that the provisions of this act shall not apply to colored nurses having the care of white children or sick white persons violates section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the Federal constitution and is void It was further held that the obnoxious section could not be segregated and that the entire statute must be held void The court said in part We are entirely clear that section 7 of the questioned act is violative of section 1 of the fourteenth amendment to the constitution of the United States in that it discriminately abridges the privileges and immu nities of one class of citizens of the United States by giving to another class of such citizens privileges that are withheld from the class dis criminated against It gives to the Caucasian mistress the right to have Jan1906 NOTES OF CASES 773 her child attended in the Caucasian department of the car by its African nurse and withholds from the African mistress the equal right to have her child attended in the African department of the car by its Caucasian nurse It also discriminates between the races in that it gives to the invalid adult Caucasian man or woman the right to be attended in his or her department of the car by his or her colored nurse and withholds from the African invalid the corresponding right to be attended in his or her department of the car by his or her white nurse It also gives to the African nurse the right to space in either department of the car and withholds from the Caucasian nurse the same privilege thereby dis criminating between the races in favor of the African nurse as against the Caucasian nurse belonging to the same occupational class of persons

Appellate Di vision of the Supreme Court has shown a tendency to construe section 51 of the Negotiable Instruments Law strictly and upon the theory that it was not intended thereby to change the law of New York but only to declare the law as it existed That section of the statute pro vides Consideration what constitutesValue is any consideration sufficient to support a simple contract An antecedent or preexisting debt con stitutes value and is deemed such whether the instrument is payable on demand or at a future time In Sutherland y Mead in the first Appellate Division 80 App Div 103 it was held syllabus Section 51 of the Negotiable Instruments Law Laws of 1897 chap 612 which provides an antecedent or preexist ing debt constitutes value should be construed to mean that for an antecedent or preexisting debt to constitute value which will support an action against the accommodation makers or indorsers of a promissory note which has been fraudulently diverted the antecedent debt must have been canceled and discharged on the acceptance of the note In Roseman v Mahony in the Second Appellate Division 86 App Div 377 it was held syllabus While under section 51 of the Negotiable Instruments Law Laws of 1897 chap 612 an antecedent or preexisting debt constitutes value a note given as security for a preexisting debt is not enforcible in the hands of the creditor against an accommodation in dorser thereof in order to be enforcible against the accommodation in dorser it must appear that the note was taken in payment of the preexist ing debt or that the creditor

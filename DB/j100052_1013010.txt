J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013010,SIMPLIFIED COST ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS,I242646,SIMPLIFIED COST ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS BY WALTER B PALMER SPECIAL AGENT UNITED STATES BUREAU OF FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC COMMERCE THE OBJECT OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS IS TO SECURE PROFITS NOTHING THAT RELATES TO MANUFACTURING IS OF MORE IMPORTANCE THAN COSTING EFFICIENCY RULES MAY BE APPLIED IN AN EXCELLENTLY EQUIPPED FACTORY BUT UNLESS THE PROPRIETOR HAS AN ADEQUATE COSTFINDING SYSTEM HE IS LIABLE TO SUFFER FINANCIAL LOSS IF HE DOES NOT KNOW WITH A CLOSE DEGREE OF ACCURACY WHAT THE DIFFERENT ARTICLES HE MANUFACTURES HAVE COST AND AT WHAT PRICES HE CAN AFFORD TO SELL THEM HE IS NOT IN A POSITION TO MEET COMPETITION INTELLIGENTLY AND HE INVITES BUSINESS DISASTER UNDER CONDITIONS AS THEY EXISTED FORMERLY HE MAY HAVE BEEN SATISFIED WITH THE PROFIT EARNED ON HIS WHOLE LINE OF PRODUCTS AS SHOWN BY HIS ANNUAL BALANCE SHEET BUT IN THESE DAYS THERE IS THE KEENEST COMPETITION IN ALMOST EVERY LINE OF MANUFACTURING AND THE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST IS THE INEXORABLE LAW OF THE BUSINESS WORLD EVEN IF A MANUFACTURER IS SATISFIED WITH HIS YEARLY PROFIT WHICH HIS BALANCE SHEET SHOWS HE SHOULD KNOW ON WHICH PARTICULAR PRODUCTS HE IS MAKING THE MOST PROFIT AND ON WHICH HE IS MAKING ONLY A NARROW MARGIN OF PROFIT OR LOSING MONEY INTELLIGENT COSTING WOULD ENABLE HIM TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN THE PROFITS ON DIFFERENT PRODUCTS TO DISCONTINUE THE MANUFACTURE OF PRODUCTS SOLD AT A LOSS TO LIMIT THE SALES OF PRODUCTS ON A SMALL MARGIN OT PROFIT AND TO GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO THE MANUFACTURE AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS ON WHICH THE LARGEST PROFITS ARE REALIZED COST ACCOUNTING IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FOR MANUFACTURERS WITH SMALL OR COMPARATIVELY SMALL CAPITAL IN ORDER THAT THEY MAY MEET THE SEVERE COMPETITION OF THOSE WHO MANUFACTURE ON AN EXTENSIVE SCALE AS A RULE THE LARGE MANUFACTURERS HAVE NOT ONLY THE MOST IMPROVED MACHINERY AND MOST EFFICIENT METHODS OF PRODUCTION BUT ALSO VERY ACCURATE COSTFINDING SYSTEMS THE COMPARATIVELY SMALL MANUFACTURERS HAVE NOT BEEN SO SLOW IN EQUIPPING THEIR FACTORIES WITH UPTODATE MACHINERY AND IN ADOPT ING EFFICIENCY RULES AS THEY HAVE BEEN IN PLANNING A SYSTEM BY WHICH THEY COULD KNOW THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THEIR DIFFERENT UNITS OF PRODUC 165THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TION ANY INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER WHICH MAY BE MADE WILL SHOW THAT AN AMAZING NUMBER OF AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS HAVE PRACTICALLY NO COSTING SYSTEM OR ONLY THE CRUDEST SORTS OF SYSTEMS MOST MANUFACTURERS KNOW THE COST OF MATERIALS AND THE DIRECT LABOR COST FOR EACH UNIT OF PRODUCTION BUT DO NOT INTELLIGENTLY DIS TRIBUTE THE GENERAL EXPENSE OR BURDEN OR AS IT IS COMMONLY TERMED THE OVERHEAD MANY OF THEM ADD TO THE MATERIAL AND LABOR COST FOR EACH UNIT WHAT THEY THINK JUDGING FROM PAST EXPERI ENCE THE CHARGE FOR OVERHEAD SHOULD BE AND FIX PRICES ACCORDINGLY BUT IF THEY MANUFACTURE ANY VARIETY OF PRODUCTS SUCH GUESS WORK WILL SURELY LEAD TO A DIMINUTION OF PROFIT OR TO FINANCIAL LOSS IN RECENT YEARS THE PROFESSION OF COST ACCOUNTING HAS DEVELOPED BUT THE SMALL MANUFACTURERS CONSTITUTING MUCH THE LARGER NUMBER HAVE BEEN MUCH MORE BACKWARD THAN THE LARGE PRODUCERS IN ADOPT ING THE METHODS OF THIS BRANCH OF EFFICIENCY THEY COMPLAIN OF THE FIERCENESS OF COMPETITION YET DO NOT AVAIL THEMSELVES OF A COSTING SYSTEM WHICH WOULD PROTECT THEM AGAINST SELLING AT A LOSS AND INSURE LARGER PROFITS PERHAPS THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THIS BACKWARDNESS ON THE PART OF THE SMALL MANUFACTURERS IS THAT THEY THINK THEY CAN NOT AFFORD TO PAY THE FEES WHICH ARE CHARGED BY EFFICIENCY EXPERTS FOR INSTALLING COST ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS A SIMPLE INEXPENSIVE AND YET ACCURATE COSTING SYSTEM IS ONE OF THE CRYING NEEDS OF THE SMALL MANUFACTURERS TODAY REGARDLESS OF THE EXPENSE OF THE INSTALLATION OF A SCIENTIFIC SYSTEM BY PROFESSIONAL COST ACCOUNTANTS SOME OF THE SYSTEMS ARE SO COMPLICATED AS TO PRECLUDE THEIR GENERAL USE BECAUSE THEY ARE BEYOND THE GRASP OF THE ORDINARY SMALL MANUFACTURER MANY SMALL MANUFACTURERS EMPLOY AS BOOKKEEPERS MEN AND OFTEN GIRLS WHOSE ACCOUNTING EXPERIENCE IS SO LIMITED THAT THEY CAN SCARCELY PREPARE A PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENT OR AN ANNUAL BALANCE SHEET AND WHO WOULD BE UTTERLY UNABLE TO FIGURE OUT AN ELABORATE SYSTEM OF COSTING AND YET SIMPLE PRACTICABLE SYSTEMS CAN BE ADOPTED WHICH COME WITHIN THE COMPREHENSION OF INEXPERIENCED BOOKKEEPERS AND BY MEANS OF WHICH A SATISFACTORY KNOWLEDGE OF THE COSTS OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS CAN BE OBTAINED THERE ARE TWO ELEMENTS OF COST RAW MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR WHICH CAN BE ASCERTAINED FOR DIFFERENT UNITS WITH CLOSE ACCURACY AND THESE ARE USUALLY THE LARGEST ELEMENTS ALMOST ANY MANUFACTURER KNOWS JUST HOW MUCH RAW MATERIAL IS USED IN ANY UNIT AND KNOWS THE COST OF THE DIRECT LABOR IF HE PAYS HIS EMPLOYEES ON THE PIECE 166COST ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS PRICE BASIS HE KNOWS THE COST OF THE DIRECT LABOR PER UNIT EXACTLY IF THE DIRECT LABOR OR PART OF IT IS PAID ON THE TIME RATE BASIS HE GENERALLY KNOWS FROM RECORDS OF PRODUCTION THE AVERAGE TIME RE QUIRED BY HIS EMPLOYEES TO PRODUCE A CERTAIN UNIT KNOWING THE COST FOR MATERIALS AND FOR DIRECT LABOR THE PROBLEM IS TO FIND THE PROPER BURDEN FOR GENERAL EXPENSES TO APPORTION TO EACH DIFFERENT UNIT THIS IS THE GREAT STUMBLING BLOCK IN THE WAY OF AN INCREDI BLE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS THERE ARE THREE SYSTEMS OF COSTING ALL OF THEM SIMPLE WHICH ARE MORE OR LESS USED THEY MAY BE DESIGNATED THE QUANTITY METHOD THE DIRECT LABOR METHOD AND THE PRIME COST METHOD THE QUANTITY METHOD BY THIS METHOD THE TOTAL GENERAL EXPENSE DURING THE PRECEDING BUSINESS PERIOD THAT IS ALL EXPENSE EXCEPT FOR RAW MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR IS DIVIDED BY THE NUMBER OF UNITS PRODUCED AND THE QUOTIENT IS ADDED TO THE COST OF MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR FOR EACH UNIT THIS MAY BE EXPRESSED AS FOLLOWS BURDEN LAST PERIOD  AMOUNT OF BURDEN PER UNIT NUMBER OF UNITS PRODUCED IF FOR INSTANCE DURING THE LAST PERIOD THE ENTIRE COST OF MANU FACTURING AND SELLING WERE 100000 AND THE RAW MATERIALS COST 50000 AND THE DIRECT LABOR 30000 THE BURDEN AMOUNTED TO 20000 IF THEREFORE 10000 UNITS WERE PRODUCED DURING THAT PERIOD THE BURDEN FOR EACH WOULD BE 2 OF COURSE THE AMOUNT FOR RAW MATERIALS USED IN THE COMPUTATION MUST BE THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY USED DURING THE LAST BUSINESS PERIOD AND NOT THE AMOUNT PURCHASED WHICH MAY BE MORE OR LESS AND THIS REQUIRES THAT THERE SHOULD BE INVENTORIES OF RAW MATERIALS AT THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE PERIOD THE AMOUNT FOR RAW MATERIALS THAT IS MATERIALS USED IN THE UNIT SHOULD BE KEPT DISTINCT FROM FACTORY SUPPLIES THIS METHOD OF COSTING IS THE SIMPLEST OF ALL METHODS AND WHERE ONLY ONE KIND OF GOODS IS MANUFACTURED IT IS THE MOST ACCURATE OF ALL SYSTEMS A CONCERN THAT MANUFACTURES ONLY ONE KIND OF TYPE WRITER FOR INSTANCE WOULD NOT NEED A MORE PERFECT SYSTEM BUT OBVIOUSLY THIS METHOD IS VERY DEFECTIVE IF APPLIED IN A FACTORY WHERE GOODS OF VARYING VALUES ARE PRODUCED 167THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE DIRECT LABOR METHOD BY THIS METHOD THE BURDEN CHARGE IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE COST OF THE DIRECT LABOR FOR THE UNIT IN THE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL COST OF DIRECT LABOR TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BURDEN DURING THE PRE CEDING PERIOD THIS MAY BE EXPRESSED AS FOLLOWS BURDEN LAST PERIOD  PER CENT OF BURDEN PER UNIT DIRECT LABOR PAYROLL IF DURING THE LAST PERIOD THE TOTAL DIRECT LABOR COST AMOUNTED TO 30000 AND THE BURDEN TO 20000 A CHARGE OF 6667 PER CENT OF THE DIRECT LABOR COST OF THE UNIT SHOULD BE MADE FOR BURDEN THAT IS SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE COST OF MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR FOR THE UNIT WHERE UNITS ARE PRODUCED WHICH DIFFER IN LABOR COST THIS METHOD IS MUCH MORE ACCURATE THAN THE QUANTITY METHOD BUT IT IS DEFECTIVE WHERE RAW MATERIALS OF DIFFERENT VALUES ARE USED IN DIFFERENT UNITS FOR THE REASON THAT UNDER IT THE MORE EXPENSIVE GRADES OF GOODS WOULD NOT CARRY THEIR PROPER PROPORTION OF BURDEN THE PRIME COST METHOD BY PRIME COST IS MEANT THE SUM OF THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND OF DIRECT LABOR BY THIS METHOD THE BURDEN CHARGE IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF THE SUM OF THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR FOR THE UNIT IN THE PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL COST OF RAW MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR TO THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF BURDEN DURING THE PRECEDING PERIOD THIS MAY BE EXPRESSED AS FOLLOWS BURDEN LAST PERIOD  PER CENT OF BURDEN PER UNIT RAW MATERIALS PLUS DIRECT LABOR PAYROLL IF DURING THE LAST PERIOD THE COST OF RAW MATERIALS AMOUNTED TO 50000 THE COST OF DIRECT LABOR TO 30000 A TOTAL OF 80000 AND THE BURDEN AMOUNTED TO 20000 A CHARGE OF 25 PER CENT 20000 80000 OF THE PRIME COST OF THE UNIT WOULD BE MADE FOR THE BURDEN THAT IS SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE PRIME COST THIS METHOD PROVIDES FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE BURDEN ON THE UNIT MUCH MORE ACCURATELY THAN THE QUANTITY METHOD WHERE MA TERIALS OF DIFFERENT VALUES ARE USED IN DIFFERENT UNITSS OR WHERE MORE LABOR IS EMPLOYED ON SOME UNITS THAN ON OTHERS AND THIS METHOD IS MORE ACCURATE THAN THE DIRECT LABOR METHOD WHERE MORE LABOR IS EMPLOYED ON SOME UNITS THAN ON OTHERS IN COSTING BY ANY METHOD A CHARGE SHOULD BE MADE AGAINST THE COST OF THE UNIT TO COVER THE AV ERAGE LOSS FROM WASTE AND SECONDS 168COST ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS ANY OF THE THREE METHODS WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ARE EASY OF APPLICATION EVEN BY CLERKS WHO HAVE LITTLE ACCOUNTING EXPERIENCE ANOTHER METHOD IS HOWEVER RECOMMENDED AS MORE ACCURATE AND NEARLY AS SIMPLE FOR WANT OF A BETTER DESIGNATION IT MAY BE TERMED THE DUAL METHOD THE PRIME COST METHOD IS ACCURATE FOR COMPUTING THE BURDEN ON UNITS WHICH VARY IN THE COST OF MATERIALS AND THE COST OF LABOR ONLY WHEN DURING THE LAST BUSINESS PERIOD THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS EQUALLED THE AMOUNT OF THE NET SALES THERE WOULD BE AN INACCURACY IF THE NET SALES AMOUNTED TO MORE OR LESS THAN THE PRODUCTION BE CAUSE THE BURDEN FOR THE COST TO SELL SHOULD BE COMPUTED ON THE AMOUNT OF THE NET SALES AND NOT ON THE PRODUCTION BY THE DUAL METHOD THE RATIO OF BURDEN FOR THE UNIT IS COMPUTED ON THE PRIME COST DURING THE PRECEDING PERIOD FOR INDIRECT LABOR AND FOR FACTORY EXPENSE BECAUSE THESE PORTIONS OF THE BURDEN ARE RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE PRODUCTION BUT THE SELLING EXPENSE IS COMPUTED NOT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION BUT ON THE AMOUNT OF THE NET SALES THE RATIO OF BURDEN FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IS ALSO COMPUTED ON THE AMOUNT OF NET SALES AS THE BASE BECAUSE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE IS PERHAPS MORE NEARLY RELATED TO THE AMOUNT OF NET SALES THAN TO THE VALUE OF THE PRODUCTION THOUGH THIS MAY DIFFER IN DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES IF FOR EXAMPLE THE EXPENSES DURING THE LAST PERIOD WERE 50000 FOR RAW MATERIALS 30000 FOR DIRECT LABOR 4000 FOR INDIRECT LABOR 3000 FOR FACTORY EXPENSE 6000 FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE AND 7000 FOR SELLING EXPENSE MAKING A TOTAL OF 100000 BUT IF THE NET SALES AMOUNTED TO 110000 THE PERCENTAGE OF BURDEN FOR THE UNIT WOULD BE COMPUTED AS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING ILLUSTRATION EXPENSES LAST PERIOD PER CENT OF BURDEN FOR UNIT RAW MATERIALS 50000 DIRECT LABOR 30000 PRIME COST 80000 INDIRECT LABOR 4000 500 4000  80000 FACTORY EXPENSE 3000 375 3000 80000 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 6000 545 6000 110000 SELLING EXPENSE 7000 636 7000 110000 TOTAL 100000 NET SALES 110000 169THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THESE PERCENTAGES ARE USED TO FIND THE BURDEN FOR A UNIT WHICH IS INTENDED TO BE SOLD AT 10 FOR INSTANCE AND THE COST OF WHICH FOR RAW MATERIALS WAS 425 AND FOR DIRECT LABOR 255 AS ILLUSTRATED BELOW RAW MATERIAL 425 DIRECT LABOR 255 PRIME COST 680 INDIRECT LABOR 34 5 OF 680 FACTORY EXPENSE 255 375 OF 680 ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE 545 545 OF 1000 SELLING EXPENSE 636 636 OF 1000 WASTE 043 EG 1 OF 425 SECONDS 068 EG 1 OF 680 TOTAL COST 869 PROFIT 131 131 OF 1000 SELLING PRICE 1000 AS A MATTER OF FACT MOST GOODS ARE MANUFACTURED TO SELL AT CERTAIN PRICES WHICH ARE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE AND IF THE SPECIFI CATIONS FOR RAW MATERIAL AND FOR LABOR ARE FOUND TO BE TOO HIGH TO ALLOW A FAIR PROFIT AT THE DETERMINED PRICE CHEAPER MATERIAL OR LESS LABOR IS USED THE DUAL METHOD MAY BE VARIED BY BASING THE PERCENTAGE OF BUR DEN FOR INDIRECT LABOR AND FACTORY EXPENSE ON THE DIRECT LABOR COST IN STEAD OF THE PRIME COST AND IT IS CLAIMED THAT FOR SOME INDUSTRIES WHERE THE MATERIALS USED DIFFER BUT LITTLE IN COST PER UNIT THIS MOD IFIED METHOD IS MORE SATISFACTORY IN ORDER TO COMPUTE THE BURDEN BY THE DUAL METHOD ACCOUNTS SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THE FOREGOING MENTIONED ITEMS AND THEY MAY BE SUBDIVIDED AS APPEARS BELOW RAW MATERIALS DIRECT LABOR WAGES OF

SPECIALLY RULED LEDGER IS USED SOME OF THE ITEMS UNDER FACTORY EXPENSE MIGHT NOT IM 171THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PROPERLY BE ENTERED UNDER COST OF ADMINISTRATION THEIR PLACEMENT BEING A MATTER OF OPINION BUT AS THESE ITEMS ARE USUALLY SMALL THE RESULT IN COMPUTING THE BURDEN ON A UNIT WOULD BE LITTLE IF ANY AFFECTED BY A TRANSFER OF THEM FROM ONE ACCOUNT TO ANOTHER IN COMPUTING THE PROPORTION OF BURDEN FOR THE UNIT ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCTION AND NET SALES DURING THE PRECEDING BUSINESS PERIOD THE RESULTS WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE IF THE PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENT WERE MADE SEMIANNUALLY INSTEAD OF ANNUALLY AND STILL MORE AC CURATE IF SUCH A STATEMENT WERE MADE QUARTERLY IN MAKING COM PUTATIONS BY ANY METHOD IT SHOULD BE BORNE IN MIND THAT THE COST OF MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR WHILE USUALLY THE LARGEST ELEMENTS OF COST ARE THOSE WHICH ARE MOST LIABLE TO FLUCTUATION AND IN CALCULATING THE BURDEN ON THE BASIS OF THE LAST PERIOD THE DIFFERENCES IN THE COST OF MATERIALS AND DIRECT LABOR AT THAT TIME AND AT THE TIME THE COM PUTATION IS MADE SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WHEN A MANUFACTURER GETS OUT NEW STYLES HE MUST BE PARTICU LARLY CAREFUL IN COSTING IF ALL OR ANY PART OF THE DIRECT LABOR IS PAID ON THE TIMERATE BASIS IN MAKING UP SAMPLES FOR SALESMEN TO TAKE OUT ON THE ROAD HE SHOULD MAKE TIME STUDIES OF THE SEVERAL DIRECT LABOR OPERATIONS TO ASCERTAIN AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE DIRECT LABOR COST PER UNIT WHEN THE GOODS TO FILL THE FIRST ORDERS RECEIVED ARE MANUFACTURED HE SHOULD CHECK UP HIS FIRST COMPUTATION BY THE COST TO MANUFACTURE IN QUANTITIES AND IF THERE IS A DIFFERENCE HE SHOULD ADJUST THE SELLING PRICE PER UNIT ACCORDINGLY IF IT SHOULD HAPPEN THAT HIS PRICE FOR GOODS OF A CERTAIN STYLE AS GIVEN TO THE SALESMEN IS TOO LOW TO AFFORD A PROFIT THE EARLIER HE CHECKS UP HIS FIRST CALCULATION OF THE COST FOR THAT STYLE THE LESS MONEY HE WILL LOSE WHILE ALL OF THE METHODS OF COSTING WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED ARE COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE AND WHILE FOR MOST FAC TORIES ONE OF THESE METHODS WOULD BE FOUND ENTIRELY PRACTICABLE AND SATISFACTORY IT IS NOT CLAIMED THAT FOR A HIGHLY ORGANIZED FACTORY WITH MANY DEPARTMENTS ANY OF THESE METHODS WOULD BE AS ACCURATE AS ONE WHICH WOULD BE ADAPTED TO THE PARTICULAR NEEDS OF THE PLANT AND WHICH MIGHT BE DEVISED BY COST ACCOUNTING EXPERTS AFTER A COMPLETE CAREFUL STUDY OF THE FACTORY CONDITIONS IN A HIGHLY ORGANIZED ESTABLISHMENT THE DEPARTMENTAL METHOD OF APPORTIONING BURDEN SHOULD BE ADOPTED CERTAIN BURDEN CHARGES SHOULD BE MADE AGAINST THE WHOLE PRODUCTION OF THE FACTORY CERTAIN CHARGES AGAINST THE PRODUCTION OF PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS ONLY AND 172COST ACCOUNTING FOR MANUFACTURERS OTHER CHARGES IN PART AGAINST THE PRODUCTION OF THE WHOLE FACTORY AND IN PART AGAINST THE PRODUCTION OF PARTICULAR DEPARTMENTS IF A COTTON MILL FOR INSTANCE SELLS YARN AND CLOTH THE FACTORY EXPENSE FOR THE WEAVE ROOM OR FOR THE COST OF INDIRECT LABOR IN THAT ROOM SHOULD NOT BE MADE A PART OF THE BURDEN ON THE PRODUCT OF THE SPINNING ROOM IN A PRINTING PLANT THE PRODUCT THAT IS PRINTED ONLY SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED WITH THE EXPENSE FOR THE BINDERY DE PARTMENT THE GREAT NEED OF ADEQUATE COST FINDING AMONG AMERICAN MANU FACTURERS HAS BEEN EMPHASIZED THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN NATIONAL ASSOCIATIONS OF MANUFACTURERS FROM YEAR TO YEAR BUT SO FAR AS KNOWN NO ASSOCIATION HAS APPROVED ANY PARTICULAR SYSTEM IN MANY LINES OF MANUFACTURING WHOLE INDUSTRIES HAVE SUFFERED FROM THE GENERAL LACK OF INTELLIGENT COSTING THE UNINTELLIGENT OR UNPROGRESSIVE MANUFACTURER OFTEN MAKES PRICES TO UNDERSELL HIS COMPETITORS NOT REALLY KNOWING WHETHER HE IS MAKING OR LOSING MONEY ON THE GOODS HE SELLS BUT IN SOME CASES THINKING HE IS MAK ING MONEY WHEN HE IS ACTUALLY LOSING SO MUCH BUSINESS IS DONE IN THIS CUTTHROAT MANNER THAT EVEN ESTABLISHMENTS WHICH HAVE INSTALLED ELABORATE COSTFINDING SYSTEMS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO ABANDON THEM AND REVERT TO THE RUINOUS POLICY OF MEETING THE COMPETITION OF RECKLESS BUSINESS RIVALS REGARDLESS OF CONSEQUENCE THEY DO THIS TO HOLD THEIR TRADE HOPING THAT PROFITS ON SOME LINES WILL COMPENSATE FOR LOSSES ON OTHER LINES THE RESULT IS THAT MANY LINES OF THE MANU FACTURING BUSINESS ARE CUT TO PIECES THE NATIONAL MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATIONS COULD DO NO GREATER SERVICE FOR THEIR MEMBERS THAN TO URGE THEM TO ADOPT ADEQUATE COSTFINDING SYSTEMS 173

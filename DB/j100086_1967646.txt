in a large variety of slowly convergent series in which the positive and negative terms are about evenly balanced in number and aggre gate value throughout the series that series 7 converges rapidly and the error made by stopping at any term is less than the last term added In prac tical computation this fact will often be sufficiently evident from a simple in spection of the series The question of finding an upper limit to the error will be considered later See 5 2 Illustrative Examples We will now illustrate the method de scribed in the last section by applying it to some numerical examples and in doing so we will indicate a number of slight modifications which are often ad vantageous sin 2x sin 3x Example I bSx  sin x  2  3  To evaluate this series when x  500 we may tabulate the work

result is much closer to the true value than could have been reached by simply adding terms This example illustrates the limitations of the method also how it will usually become evident if the method cannot be profitably employed in its entirety and how it may still be more or less useful in a modified form 3 Proof of Convergence We will now complete the proof of 7 by showing that the remainder Rk

applied to certain divergent series it renders them convergent This fact becomes of peculiar interest when we apply the method to power series as we thus get an analytic continuation of the function originally represented But similar re sults may be reached by the method of conformal transformation As this treatment of this phase of the subject is simpler we will not enter upon the discussion

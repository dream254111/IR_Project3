J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1078484,A STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES,I244696,A STANDARD OF INTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES LEROY D WELD COE COLLEGE CEDAR RAPIDS IOWA A GREAT DEAL HAS BEEN WRITTEN REGARDING METHODS OF STANDARD IZING TEACHERS IN THE GRADING OF PUPILS AND VARIOUS SCHEMES ARE IN USE WHEREBY TEACHERS ARE CONSTRAINED TO EXERCISE ARBITRARY RULES OF JUDGMENT IN ORDER TO MAKE THE RESULTS OF THEIR GRADING FULFIL CERTAIN THEORETICAL CONDITIONS WE ARE TOLD FOR EXAMPLE THAT IN SOME LARGE AMERICAN COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES USING FORMS OF THE SOCALLED MISSOURI SYSTEM IT IS EXPECTED OF TEACHERS THAT A SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE OF THEIR ASSIGNED GRADES SHALL BE ABOVE GO ANOTHER SPECIFIED PERCENTAGE BETWEEN 90 AND 8O ETC OR THE EQUIVALENT OF THESE FIGURES IN TERMS OF LETTERS AND THAT THE DISTRIBUTION THUS SOUGHT IS APPROXIMATELY THAT OF THE FAMILIAR SYMMETRICAL PROBABILITY OR ERROR LAW IT IS NOT THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER TO DISCUSS THE MERITS OF EITHER NUMERICAL OR LITERAL GRADE ASSIGNMENTS OR OF THE CATEGORIES EXCEL LENT GOOD FAIR ETC AS AGAINST ANY SORT OF GRADE SCALE WE SHALL START OUT WITH THE SIMPLE FACT THAT AMONG THE GREAT MASSES OF OUR SCHOOL AND COLLEGE TEACHERS AND PUPILS THE ONE COMMON LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE SCHOLARLY ATTAINMENTS OF PUPILS ARE EXPRESSED IS A SCALAR ONE WHICH MAY AS WELL BE NUMERICAL AS LITERAL OR OTHERWISE ARBITRARY IF WE WHO LIVE IN THE MIDDLE WEST READ IN A NEW YORK MAGAZINE THAT A CERTAIN MAN ENTERED COLLEGE WITH AN AVERAGE GRADE OF 95 IN HIS PREPARATORY WORK WE KNOW PRETTY WELL WHAT THAT MEANS AND SO IT IS THE COUNTRY OVER AND IT WILL PROBABLY BE A LONG TIME BEFORE THE PEOPLE AT LARGE WILL BE EDUCATED TO ANY OTHER RADICALLY DIFFERENT MODE OF EXPRESSION THE PROBLEM NOW PRESENTED IS THAT OF ESTABLISHING A METHOD WHEREBY GRADES ASSIGNED BY ONE TEACHER CAN BE INTELLIGENTLY COM PARED WITH THOSE ASSIGNED BY ANOTHER AND ALL BROUGHT TO A COMMON STANDARD THE WRITER DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS CAN BE ACCOM 412INTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES 413 PLISHED BY FORCING TEACHERS TO CONFORM TO A THEORETICAL SYSTEM THE SCIENTIFIC BASIS OF WHICH THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND AND WHICH IGNORES THOSE HUMAN ELEMENTS OF SYMPATHY AND ENCOURAGEMENT WHICH MAKE TEACHING THE NOBLE PROFESSION THAT IT IS ON THE CONTRARY WE PROPOSE THAT THE TEACHER BE LET ALONE LEFT TO EXERCISE HER OWN FREE MODE OF RATING WE SHALL SHOW HOW THE GRADES OF EACH TEACHER CAN BE EASILY TRANSLATED INTO TERMS OF A COMMON STANDARD AND EVEN INTO TERMS OF THE PROBABILITY SCALE IF DESIRED WITHOUT THAT TEACHERS KNOWING ANYTHING ABOUT IT INDEED IT WERE BETTER THAT SHE SHOULD NOT KNOW HER OWN PECULIARITIES IN THIS RESPECT FOR LET HER ONCE BE CONSCIOUS THAT SHE IS NOT QUITE NORMAL IN THE MATTER OF GRADING AND SHE WILL IMMEDIATELY BEGIN THOUGH PERHAPS WITHOUT REALIZING IT TO DOCTOR HER RATINGS AND GIVE CONSTRAINED INSTEAD OF NATURAL JUDGMENTS LET US FIRST EXAMINE THE ORDINARY PERCENTAGE SCALE OF GRADING AND THE RESULTS OF ITS USE THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT IF IT WERE POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE ACCURATELY WHAT IS CALLED SCHOLARSHIP OR PROFICIENCY AND EXPRESS IT IN UNITS IT WOULD BE FOUND TO HAVE IN THE LONG RUN THE SYMMETRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE THEORETICAL ERROR LAW LIKE SHOTS TO RIGHT AND LEFT OF A TARGET OR THE STATURES OF PEOPLE ABOVE AND BELOW THE AVERAGE BUT THE FACT IS THAT TEACHERS DO NOT IN GRADING TAKE THE SAME ATTITUDE TOWARD GOOD STUDENTS AND POOR ONES ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION THEY MARK THE POOR STUDENTS HIGHER IN PROPORTION TO THEIR ATTAINMENT THAN THEY DO THE GOOD STUDENTS THUS REVEALING EITHER THE ELEMENT OF SYMPATHY ALREADY REFERRED TO OR SOME LESS WORTHY MOTIVE AS OF PASSING ALONG DULL PUPILS IN ORDER TO GET RID OF THEM THIS TENDENCY HAS BEEN PROVED IN TWO INDEPENDENT WAYS I THE TESTIMONY OF THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES MANY OF WHOM HAVE BEEN QUESTIONED ON THIS POINT AND HAVE ALMOST INVARIABLY ADMITTED BEING CONSCIOUS OF AN INCLINA TION TO SHOVE ALONG THE POOR PUPIL AND GRADE HIM HIGHER THAN HE DESERVES AND 2 THE STATISTICAL EVIDENCE BASED UPON A STUDY OF MANY THOUSANDS OF GRADES ASSIGNED BY BOTH PUBLICSCHOOL AND COLLEGE TEACHERS THIS LATTER INVESTIGATION HAS GIVEN SOME VERY INTERESTING RESULTS AND IS THE BASIS OF OUR PROPOSED METHOD OF STANDARDIZING TEACHERS ASSIGNED GRADES SEE WELD THEORY OF ERRORS AND LEAST SQUARES CHAP IV414 THE SCHOOL REVIEW THE GRADE LISTS USED IN THIS STUDY WERE OBTAINED IN PART FROM COLLEGE RECORDS AND IN LARGER MEASURE FROM THE RECORDS OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS OF CEDAR RAPIDS KINDLY FURNISHED BY SUPERINTENDENT J J MCCONNELL FOR THE PURPOSE OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL GRADES BEING TABULATED FROM LISTS ASSIGNED BY ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TEACHERS OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS THE PUBLICSCHOOL GRADES WERE NUMERICAL EACH GRADE BEING ASSIGNED TO THE NEAREST MULTIPLE OF FIVE FOR EXAMPLE THE GRADES 73 74 75 76 77 WERE ALL CALLED 75 WHILE 78 79 8O 81 82 WERE CALLED 8O ETC THE COLLEGE GRADES WERE LITERAL EACH HAVING HOWEVER A WELL UNDERSTOOD APPROXIMATE NUMERICAL SIGNIFICANCE THE WORK OF TABULATION WAS CARRIED OUT BY MR LESLIE L FISHWILD IN 1915 HIS SUMMARIZED RESULTS BEING AS FOLLOWS OUT OF OVER IOOOOO GRADES PRACTICALLY NONE WERE BELOW 50 I PER CENT WERE 50 13 PER CENT WERE 8O I   55 13   85 2   6O 25   90 2   65 23   95 5 70 9  I00OO 6   75 THESE RESULTS ARE SHOWN GRAPHICALLY IN FIG I THE UNSYMMETRICAL CHARACTER OF WHICH IS UNMISTAKABLE EVIDENCE OF THE TENDENCY TO CROWD POOR STUDENTS UP THE SCALE FIG 2 SHOWS THE NORMAL PROB ABILITY DISTRIBUTION ASSUMED TO BE IDEAL BY THE USERS OF THAT SYSTEM IT IS INTERESTING TO STUDY IN THIS MANNER THE GRADES ASSIGNED BY INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS AS THEIR PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS IN GRADING ARE BROUGHT OUT VERY DISTINCTLY IN THIS WAY SOME SHOW MUCH GREATER CROWDING THAN THIS AVERAGE SOME MUCH LESS OCCASIONALLY A TEACHER WILL SHOW VERY ERRATIC TENDENCIES AND VERY RARELY ONE IS FOUND WHOSE GRADE DISTRIBUTION IS APPROXIMATELY SYMMETRICAL AS THEORY WOULD DEMAND THE WRITER HAS TAKEN UP THE SUBJECT OF THIS ACTUAL GRADE DISTRI BUTION AS A MATHEMATICAL PROBLEM BASING THE THEORY UPON CERTAIN VERY SIMPLE ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVING THREE SEPARATE PERSONAL CHARAC TERISTICS OF THE INDIVIDUAL TEACHER IN GRADING THE RESULT BEING A FORMULA THAT AGREES VERY CLOSELY WITH THE STATISTICAL FACTS IT HAS BEEN FOUND IN PRACTICE HOWEVER THAT ONE OF THESE CHARACTERISTICSINTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES 415 VIZ THE RANGE TO WHICH PRACTICALLY ALL THE TEACHERS ASSIGNED GRADES ARE CONFINED UNDERGOES LITTLE VARIATION AND CAN THEREFORE BE ASSUMED AS CONSTANT FOR ALL TEACHERS WHICH LEAVES BUT TWO PERSONAL CHARACTERISTICS TO BE

WOULD EXPRESS IT ONLY TWO PARAMETERS ARE NECESSARY IN THE TEACHERS GRADEDISTRIBUTION FORMULA THIS MATHEMATICAL WORK MAY BE PUBLISHED MORE APPROPRIATELY ELSEWHERE BUT ITS OUTCOME IS THE SIMPLE AND PRACTICAL METHOD NOW TO BE PRESENTED WHEREBY ANY SUPERINTENDENT OR PRINCIPAL OR COLLEGE REGISTRAR CAN DETERMINE THE TEACHERS TYPE OF GRADE ASSIGNMENT FROM A SINGLE SEMESTERS GRADES AND BE ABLE THEREAFTER TO TRANSLATE THE GRADES GIVEN BY THAT TEACHER416 THE SCHOOL REVIEW TO A STANDARD SCALE WHICH MAY BE USED WHENEVER A STUDENTS ACTUAL RANKING IS TO BE DETERMINED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS METHOD THE DATA ARE TABULATED IN A MORE CONVENIENT FORM THAN THE FOREGOING INSTEAD OF FINDING THE PERCENTAGE OF A TEACHERS GRADES WHICH ARE SAY 70 OR 65 AS IN THE MATHEMATICAL TREATMENT REFERRED TO WE FIND THE PERCENTAGE WHICH ARE 70 OR ABOVE 65 OR ABOVE ETC AND TABULATE THESE VALUES IT WAS FOUND THAT OF THE THOUSANDS OF GRADES EXAMINED BY MR FISHWILD VARY APPROXIMATELY IOO PER CENT WERE 50 OR ABOVE 83 PER CENT WERE 8O OR ABOVE 99   55   70   85   98   60   57   90   96   65   32   95   94 70 IT 9  I0OO 89   75   THE PASSING GRADE BEING 75 11 PER CENT OF THE GRADES DENOTE FAILURE WHILE IT WOULD OF COURSE BE DESIRABLE TO MAKE A SELECTION FROM VARIOUS LOCALITIES IT IS FAIR TO PRESUME THAT THIS DISTRIBUTION IS NOT FAR FROM NORMAL THE COUNTRY OVER SINCE THE TEACHERS ASSIGNING THESE GRADES WERE NOT BY ANY MEANS ALL OF LOCAL ORIGIN AT ANY RATE THIS DISTRIBUTION EVEN IF NOT QUITE THE AVERAGE FOR THE UNITED STATES WILL SERVE OUR PURPOSE AS A REFERENCE POINT AND MEANS OF COMPARISON IT IS SHOWN GRAPHICALLY BY THE HEAVY CURVE IN FIG 3 ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING CURVES FOR CERTAIN INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS WHICH ARE DOTTED NOW THE FOUNDATION PRINCIPLE OF OUR METHOD IS THAT WE MAY EXPECT ANY ONE LARGE GROUP OF UNSELECTED PUPILS AS THOSE HANDLED BY ONE TEACHER IN A YEAR TO HAVE ABOUT THE SAME ACTUAL SCHOLARSHIP ON THE AVERAGE AS ANY OTHER SIMILAR LARGE GROUP THIS MEANS THAT RADICAL DIFFERENCES OBSERVED IN THE GRADE DISTRIBUTION OF ONE TEACHER FROM THAT OF ANOTHER HAVE THEIR ORIGIN IN THE CHARACTERISTIC GRADING METHODS OF THE TEACHERS THEMSELVES RATHER THAN IN THE PUPILS THEY HANDLE IF IN ANY CASE THERE IS REASON TO BELIEVE OTHERWISE DUE ALLOWANCE SHOULD OF COURSE BE MADE FOR THE FACT IN APPLYING THE METHOD WE MAY NOW PROCEED TO CLASSIFY TEACHERS INTO TYPES ACCORDING TO THEIR PECULIAR CHARACTERISTICS IN GRADING THIS MAY BE DONE ASINTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES 4I7 MINUTELY AND OVER AS LARGE A RANGE AS WE THINK BEST BUT THE WRITER SUGGESTS THE USE OF TWENTY TYPES CONSECUTIVELY NUMBERED OF WHICH THE MIDDLE ONES ARE NEAREST TO THE NORMAL OR STANDARD IT IS BELIEVED THAT THIS NUMBER WILL SUFFICE IN PRACTICE THESE TYPES ARE IDENTIFIED AS BEFORE MENTIONED BY MEANS OF TWO SIMPLE CHARAC 90 IA 14 70    A 1460 R  I I  30     0 60 0 80 90 00 FIG 3 TERISTICS FOR WHICH I HAVE SELECTED A THE PERCENTAGE OF THE TEACHERS ASSIGNED GRADES THAT ARE 70 OR ABOVE AND B THE PER CENTAGE THAT ARE 90 OR ABOVE THE FORMER A IS MORE IMPORTANT IN IDENTIFYING THE TYPE THAN THE LATTER B FOR THE AVERAGE OR STANDARD DISTRIBUTION THAT WE ARE USING A IS 94 PER CENT AND B IS 56 PER CENT WHICH BY THE WAY IS RATHER SURPRISING WHEN WE THINK OF IT IT IS AN ACTUAL FACT HOWEVER THAT418 THE SCHOOL REVIEW 56 PER CENT OF ALL THE GRADES EXAMINED BY MR FISHWILD WERE 90 OR ABOVE WHICH EXHIBITS MORE STRIKINGLY THAN EVER THE GENERAL TENDENCY TO CROWD UP THE SCALE FOR INDIVIDUAL TEACHERS A AND B WILL HAVE DIFFERENT SETS OF VALUES AND AFTER CONSIDERABLE STUDY OF ACTUAL DISTRIBUTIONS THE TWENTY TYPES SHOWN IN TABLE I AT END OF PAPER HAVE BEEN SELECTED AS FAIRLY REPRESENTATIVE OF THE RANGE LIKELY TO BE ENCOUNTERED IN GENERAL THE FIRST TYPES CORRESPOND TO THE CONSISTENTLY LOW MARKERS AND THE LAST TO THE CONSISTENTLY HIGH MARKERS WHILE THE MIDDLE TYPE II IS ABOUT NORMAL PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE ALSO FOR CERTAIN TYPES THAT FOR SOME REASON ARE HIGH MARKERS OF GOOD PUPILS AND LOW MARKERS OF POOR PUPILS OR VICE VERSA IT IS CERTAIN THAT SUCH TYPES EXIST IN PRACTICE A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF TWO TYPES MAY SOMETIMES BE FOUND SATISFACTORY WITH GRADUAL TRANSITION ALONG THE SCALE FROM ONE TYPE TO THE OTHER THE NEXT STEP IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE METHOD WAS TO COMPARE THE GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS CORRESPONDING TO THE RESPECTIVE TYPES WITH THE STANDARD DISTRIBUTION FAMILIARITY WITH THE FORM OF THE DISTRIBUTION CURVE FIG 3 THROUGH PLOTTING MANY INDIVIDUAL GRADE DISTRIBUTIONS MADE IT POSSIBLE TO TRACE CURVES WITH FAIR ACCURACY WHEN ONLY THE TWO CHARACTERISTIC POINTS AT 70 AND 90O WERE GIVEN A NUMBER OF SUCH CURVES ARE SHOWN DOTTED IN FIG 3 THE GRADE COMPARISON THEN BECAME A SIMPLE MATTER FOR EXAMPLE IT WAS FOUND FROM THE CURVE FOR TYPE I6 THAT GRADES OF 8O OR ABOVE ARE GIVEN BY TEACHERS OF THIS TYPE IN ABOUT 92 PER CENT OF THEIR GRADINGS WHILE WE OBSERVE THAT THIS SAME PERCENTAGE OF THE GRADINGS OF THE STANDARD MARKER TYPE I I ARE 73 OR ABOVE WE MAY THEREFORE CONCLUDE THAT THE GRADE 8O GIVEN BY A TEACHER OF TYPE 16 CORRESPONDS TO THE GRADE 73 ON THE STANDARD SCALE OF MARKING IN A SIMILAR MANNER IF A TEACHER OF TYPE 6 GIVES A PUPIL THE GRADE 8O IT IS EQUIVALENT TO 83 ON THE STANDARD SCALE THIS TEACHER BEING A LOW MARKER PROCEEDING IN THIS MANNER IT HAS BEEN FOUND POSSIBLE TO CON STRUCT AN APPROXIMATE TABLE TABLE II WHEREBY SUCH TRANSLATIONS MAY BE MADE AT A GLANCE AS SOON AS THE TYPE TO WHICH THE TEACHER BELONGS HAS BEEN DECIDED UPON GRADES INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THOSE PROVIDED FOR IN THE TABLE CAN BE EASILY INTERPOLATEDINTERPRETATION OF NUMERICAL GRADES 419 THE POSSESSION OF TABLES I AND II WITH A SEMESTER OR SO OF GRADE REPORTS FROM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO ENABLE ANY SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENT OR COLLEGE ADMINISTRATOR TO ACCOMPLISH THE DESIRED STANDARDIZATION AND COMPARISON THE METHOD OF PROCEDURE MAY BE SUMMARIZED FOR PRACTICAL USE IN THE FORM OF THE FOLLOWING DIRECTIONS I TO STANDARDIZE A TEACHERS GRADING EXAMINE A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF THAT TEACHERS GRADES THE MORE THE BETTER ASCERTAINING A WHAT PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE 70 OR ABOVE AND B WHAT PERCENTAGE ARE GO90 OR ABOVE 2 FIND FROM TABLE I THE TYPE THAT CORRESPONDS MOST NEARLY WITH THESE CHARACTERISTICS A AND B AND ASSIGN THE TEACHER TO THAT TYPE A JUDICIOUS COMBINATION OF TYPES MAY PROVE SATISFACTORY A SHOULD HAVE MORE INFLUENCE THAN B IN SELECTING THE TYPE 3 THE STANDARD GRADE WHICH CORRESPONDS TO ANY ONE OF THE TEACHERS ASSIGNED GRADES APPEARING IN THE TOP ROW OF TABLE II IS GIVEN BELOW IT IN THE SAME COLUMN OPPOSITE THE TEACHERS TYPE NUMBER EXAMPLE IT IS FOUND THAT 92 PER CENT OF THE GRADES ASSIGNED BY MISS M ARE 70 OR ABOVE AND 45 PER CENT ARE 90O OR ABOVE REFERRING TO TABLE I IT IS SEEN THAT MISS M BELONGS IN THE NEIGH BORHOOD OF TYPE 8 SHE IS A LOW MARKER THE HORIZONTAL ROW OPPOSITE TYPE 8 IN TABLE II NOW SHOWS THAT MISS MS 50 IS EQUIVALENT TO A STANDARD 54 HER 55 TO A STANDARD 59 ETC IF A TEACHER IS FOUND WHOSE CHARACTERISTICS ARE NOWHERE NEAR BEING REPRESENTED BY ANY OF THE TYPES AS MAY SOMETIMES OCCUR IT IS EVIDENCE OF SOME VERY ERRATIC HABIT OF GRADING AND MORE COMPLETE TABULATION OF THE GRADES WILL BE DESIRABLE THIS IS LIKELY TO REVEAL INCONSISTENCIES WHICH CAN BE EXPLAINED ONLY BY AN UTTER LACK OF SYSTEM IN GRADING OR OF APPRECIATION OF WHAT GRADES MEAN IN ANY CASE THAT TEACHER WILL BEAR WATCHING IN THIS RESPECT AT LEAST MR FISHWILD RAN ACROSS TWO OR THREE CASES OF THIS SORT IN HIS RESEARCH SUCH INSTANCES ARE HOWEVER EXCEPTIONAL AND NEED NOT INTERFERE WITH THE GENERAL APPLICATION OF THE METHOD THE VALUE OF SUCH INFORMATION AS THIS METHOD FURNISHES NEED HARDLY BE ENLARGED UPON AN ILLUSTRATION IS FOUND IN THE PROBLEM OF SELECTING THE HONOR STUDENTS FROM THE MEMBERS OF A GRADUATING CLASS WHO HAVE HAD THEIR INSTRUCTION UNDER DIFFERENT GROUPS OF

GRADING IN DIFFERENT SCHOOLS MAY BE COMPARED IN EXACTLY THE SAME MANNER AS THOSE OF DIFFERENT TEACHERS THE PROCESS BEING CAPABLE OF CONSIDERABLY GREATER REFINEMENT BECAUSE OF THE LARGER AMOUNT OF DATA AVAILABLE THIS MIGHT BE MADE USE OF IN THE RATING OF HIGH SCHOOLS BY COLLEGE ENTRANCE BOARDS SO THAT FOR EXAMPLE A STUDENT COMING FROM A CERTAIN HIGH SCHOOL WITH AN AVERAGE OF 87 COULD BE CONSIDERED TO HAVE AN AVERAGE OF 85 FROM A STANDARD HIGH SCHOOL IT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE WRITER AS TIME PERMITS TO GATHER DATA FROM A WIDER FIELD AND BY THEIR USE TO IMPROVE TABLES I AND II SO THAT THEY MAY ATTAIN THE GREATEST POSSIBLE ACCURACY AND APPLICABIL ITY STATISTICS OF THIS KIND AND SUGGESTIONS OF EDUCATORS RELATIVE TO THIS SUBJECT WILL BE APPRECIATED MEANWHILE IT IS HOPED THAT THE METHOD AS

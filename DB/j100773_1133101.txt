j100773,Journal of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology,1133101,Annual Meeting of the Illinois Branch,i247466,ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS BRANCH CHESTER G VERNIER The second annual meeting of the Illinois State Society of the American Institute of Criminal Law and Criminology was held April 8th and 9th 1913 at Springfield in the rooms of the Board of Pardons at the State House By agreement with the Illinois State Bar Associa tion the meetings of that Association and the Illinois Branch were both held at the State House on the sanme days the programs being so ar ranged that the mlore important papers were read at different hours By this arrangement it was hoped to prollote a feeling of mutual helpful ness By the courtesy of the secretary of the Bar Association programs of the two meetings were sent out in the same envelope to all members of the Bar Association and to 1500 lawyers who are not members In addition the officers of the Bar Association voted to extend to the Illi nois Branch the privilege of five pages in the annual report of the Bar Association to be used in setting out a brief history of the Illinois Branch and in giving a brief resumn of the proceedings of the annual meeting This attempt to foster a closer relationship between the two societies though not resulting in complete success was so far successful that it is hoped that the experiment may be repeated next year with some slight modifications One of the papers read at the second annual meeting is published in this issue of the Journal The purpose of this article is to set forth very briefly the work of the Illinois Branch during the past year with a brief resume of the discussion and action taken at the Springfield meeting At the first annual meeting held in Chicago in May 1912 Judge Orrin N Carter of the Supreme Court was elected president of the Illi nois Branch for the ensuing year At the summer meeting of the na tional organization held in Milwaukee Judge Carter was selected for the presidency of the national organization Judge Carter thereupon re signed the presidency of the Illinois Branch maintaining how ever an active interest in its success By action of the executive council Judge William N Gemmill of the Chicago Municipal Court was elected president of the Illinois Branch to fill the unexpired term The first session of the society was called to order at 300 p m Tuesday April 8th by the president Judge Gemmill who read the presidents annual address The subject of the address was What is wrong with the administration of our Criminal Law After mention of 196MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS BRANCH some of the diverse views of others upon this problem reference was made to the vast amount of misinformation current in America espe cially as to the English administration of criminal law It is not gen erally known that the prison population of England and Wales is greater than our own although we have twice the number of inhabitants that the percentage of judgments set aside by the new English Court of Criminal Appeals exceeds that of the Supreme Court of Illinois and of any other court of last resort in the United States and that English judges as a whole have had no larger training and experience and are no more efficient than judges in Illinois It is true however that crime is more prevalent here and that as many murders are committed annu ally in Chicago as in the whole of England and Wales Various reasons for Englands greater success in criminal administration were then dis cussed followed by a detailed notation of the gaps in American adminis tration by which at least fifty per cent of the worst offenders elude jus tice in Chicago with suggestions as to the manner of closing these gaps Very briefly these gaps exist because of 1 The nature of our political structure and the dislike of our people for puritanism and restraint Result a lack of efficiency unity and effort 2 The nolle pros abuse Twentyone per cent of the 21296 persons arrested on criminal charges in Chicago in 1911 escaped in this way Remedyrequire the consent of the court to such dismissals 3 Abuse of probation Remedyprovide for a systematic investi gation of every case by properly commissioned officers to guide the judge 4 Inefficiency of the grand jury In 1911 the grand jury in Chi cago released without a hearing twentyeight per cent of those held on felony charges Remedyabolish the grand jury 5 Release of prisoners on writ of error many of whom are never followed up Remedyavoid congestion of criminal dockets by desig nating one braneh of the appellate court in Chicago for review of crim inal cases holding daily sessions and giving short opinions 6 Abuse of habeas corpus There are more releases in Cook county in one month than in England and Wales in five years Remedyfollow tlle law as laid down in People v Zimmer 252 Ill 9 Following the address of the president reports of standing com mittees were called for The

This law fol lows the draft of a bill discussed and approved at the May meeting of the Illinois Branch a year ago The committee on criminal statistics ap pointed since then while of the opinion that the law is inadequate be lieves that it should be given a thorough trial and therefore gave its aid to the newly created bureau in framing a schedule In this work the bureau and the committee were aided by Mr John A Koren of Boston and other experts Judge Clyde E Stone chairman of the committee on Juvenile De linquents discussed some defects in existing laws and for the committee advocated the passage of the legislation set out below Proposed amendment of Section 10 of an Act entitled An Act to regulate the treatment and control of Dependent Neglected and Delin quent Children Approved April

sentenced the defendant shall at the end of such year be discharged and such conviction shall become void It was moved and carried that this proposed legislation be referred to the legislative committee It may be added that the legislative com mitte has since tlle April meeting taken steps to have these two bills and two others recommended by the society introduced at the present session of the legislature C A Purdunn chairman of the committee on indeterminate sen tence in reporting for the colmmittee praised the law very highly However he believed that the reformatory nature of an indeterminate sentence was largely nullified in many cases by the conduct of the states attorneys who induce prisoners to plead guilty by representing that they will be released in eleven months If the prisoner fails to be released he feels that he lias been tricked anl his attitude is one of resentment toward the law In the absence of the chairman of the committee on industrial edu cation for juveniles Professor Robert II Gault read the report of the committee rlhe committee found that several bills providing for the establishment of vocational schlools in this state had already been drafted by various organizations Several attempts were therefore made to find a common ground upon which all supporters of the movement could stand To this end the committee appealed to the chairman of the legis lative committee of this society Col Nathan William MacChesney who 200MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS BRANCH called a general conference of representatives of all these organizations Thirtyfive representatives assembled and organized by selecting Colonel MacCllesney as permanent chairman and Robert H Gault as secre tary After a general discussion the meeting adopted a resolution pre sented by Professor Leavitt chairman of the committee of this society calling for a conference committee Two meetings of this conference committee having failed of success another general conference of all representatives was called by Judge Gemmill president of this society At this conference the following resolution was adopted Resolved that any bill that mnay be presented to the legislature for the establish ment of parttime vocational schools shall provide for compulsory attend ance on the part of all persons up to the age of eighteen years who are engaged in gainful occupations Such school attendance shall not be for less than six hours a week At a final meeting of the committee of this society it seemed extremely doubtful that any of the already proposed legislation would be enacted at the present session of the legislature As a possible means of obtaining what is of particular interest to this society the committee therefore adopted the following resolutions 1 That this society urge upon boards of education the establish ment of bureaus for the study of minors who have left school to the end that there may be brought about an improvement of moral vocational and intellectual conditions 2 That this society should urge the amendment of the truancy law so as to make it possible for truants up to the age of sixteen years to be sent to the parental school 3 That legislation be enacted providing for bureaus of vocational guidance for all persons who are entitled to hold working certificates in cities of the first class The society passed a motion referring this proposed legislation to the legislative committee which has since taken steps to have the neces sary bills introduced The committee on the adoption of a new constitution recommended that the society adopt the uniform constitution approved by the national organization fixing the dues at one dollar for membership in the Illinois branch alone and at two dollars and a half for membership in both state and national organizations This recommended constitution was adopted Upon mnotion the president appointed the following committee on nomination of officers Colonel Nathan William MacChesney Judge O A Harker Dr A J Todd The society held its second session on the morning of Wednesday April 9 Dr William Healy director of the Juvenile Psychopathic In 201CHESTER G VERNIER stitute read a paper oln Present day aims and lmethods in studyingr the offender Some practical results Tlis paper will be published il the Journal Dr Harold N Moyer of Cllicago led the discussion Dr Moyer deplored our lack of efficiency in handling criminals and tlhe lack of a scientific study of the problem In his opinlion no theory on criim inology now existing is worth tlle paper it is written on Our knowledge of the crimlinal problem is inadequate Thle board of pardons lias not sufficient knowledge of the past life of criminals upon whose cases they are called to act He stated that in crilmes of violence the United States occupies an unenviable position Such crimes are miore numerous here than in any other large and well civilized country In only tie Argen tine Republic and Chile are tley more numerous The second paper of the morning session was read by Dr A J Todd of the University of Illinois His subject was a Workilng Pro gram for an adequate system of collecting criminal statistics in Illinois It is published in the present issue of tile Journal Mr A L Bowen Secretary of the State Charities Commission and Professor J W Gar ner of the University of Illinois led the discussion Mr Bowen dis cussed the difficulties involved in the practical problem of securing sta tistics of real worth the question of the proper body to supervise the work of collecting them and the plans of the newly created Bureau of Criminal Statistics He explained how the legislation creating this bureau en dorsed by this society had been obtained and how the schedule of data had been prepared with the assistance of Mr John Koren and tlle com mittee on criminal statistics of this society Professor Garner in discussing Dr Todds paper asserted that the need of an adequate system of collecting criminal statistics was no longer a matter of doubt The chief matter of dispute now is as to what infor mation should be and could be required In his opinion this depended upon the use to be made of such statistics Ile then discussed in detail the various possible abuses and inequalities which could be corrected by legislation Mr Garner doubted the advisability of seeking information in regard to the religion of criminals in a sclledule of statistics as pro posed in the schedule adopted by the bureau In his opinion some data not asked for in the proposed schedule might well be added The last number on the program for tlle second session was A sta tistical review of the work of the Supreme Court from 1900 to 1910 by Orrin N Carter Justice of the Supreme Court It is a matter of some pride to the society and to our state that Illinois has the honor of being the first state to publish by authority of its court of last resort a statisti cal review of its work a publication largely ldue to the interest of Judge 202MEETING OF THE ILLINOIS BRANCH Carter and Judge William N Gemmill This statistical report is re viewed in the May issue of the Journal at page 139 The last session of the meeting was held Wednesday afternoon April 9 Professor Frederick Green of the College of Law of the Uni versity of Illinois read a paper entitled A brief review of the criminal cases il the Supreme Court for the past year Professor Greens paper commenited on the thirty criminal cases decided during the year of March 1 1012 to March 1 1913 Of the thirty convictions twenty broadly speaking were affirmed and ten reversed Five of the reversals were murder cases Each case was reviewed with comment or criticism Pro fessor Greens paper will be published later in the Journal It is hoped that it may be possible to have each year a review of the work of the Supreme Court giving praise where it is due and fearlessly criticising where criticism is deserved Geo B Gillespie of the Springfield Bar on the program to lead the discussion of Professor Greens paper was unable to be present but sent in a written statement At the close of the program of papers and talks various matters were discussed

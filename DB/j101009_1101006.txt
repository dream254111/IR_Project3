WHY A SIMILAR OATH BV AN146 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JUNE OFFICER NOT MADE A PARTY IS NOT OF EQUAL WEIGHT AS AN INSTRUMENT OF EVIDENCE THE OBJECT OF MAKING THE OFFICER A PARTY IS OF COURSE TO COMPEL HIM TO ANSWERBUT IF HE MAKES THE NECESSARY DISCLOSURE UNDER OATH WITHOUT COMPULSION THIS SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE EVIDENTIARY CHARACTER OF THE ANSWER IT MAY BE OBJECTED TO THIS THAT WHEN THE PLAINTIFF MAKES THE OFFICER A PARTY DE FENDANT AND CALLS FOR DISCOVERY HE THEREBY ACCREDITS HIS VERACITY AND AGREES TO ACCEPT HIS ANSWER AS EVIDENCE AS SHOWN HOWEVER IN THORNTON V GORDON 2 ROB VA 721 THIS IS NOT THE FOUNDATION OF THE RULE UNDER WHICH AN ANSWER IN CHANCERY IS MADE AN INSTRUMENT OF EVIDENCE THOUGH SO SUGGESTED BY JUDGE STORY 2 STORY EQ JURISP 1528 FOR IF SUCH WERE THE REASON THE PLAINTIFF MIGHT DIS CLAIM CONFIDENCE IN THE DEFENDANT AND BY WAIVING OATH OR DISCOVERY DEPRIVE THE ANSWER OF ITS EVIDENTIARY VALUE UNDER THE EQUITY RULE BUT THE SUPREME COURT OF APPEALS IN THIS STATE HAS IN SEVERAL CASES DISTINCTLY REPUDIATED THIS REASONING AND HELD THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF STATUTE THE PLAINTIFF CANNOT DEPRIVE THE DEFEND ANT OF THE ADVANTAGE OF HIS SWORN ANSWER BY WAIVING OATH OR DISCLAIMING DISCOVERY THAT THE RULE MAKING THE SWORN ANSWER EVIDENCE IS A RULE OF THE FORUM BY WHICH ALL PARTIES ARE BOUND WHO INVOKE THE JURISDICTION OF EQUITY THORNTON V GORDON SUPRA JONES V ABRAHAM

TENN 192THE LATTER APPARENTLY CONTRA THE FOLLOWING EXTRACT FROM THE OPINION OF MITCHELL J IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE SEEMS TO JUSTIFY THE CONCLUSION REACHED AND TO ESTABLISH ON A SOUND BASIS THE RIGHT OF A CORPORATION TO DEMAND THAT ITS RESPONSIVE ANSWER IN CHANCERY VERIFIED BY THE OATH OF ONE OF ITS OFFICERS PERSONALLY COGNIZANT OF THE FACTS THOUGH NOT A PARTY DEFENDANT SHALL BE TREATED AS OF EQUAL EVIDEUTIARY VALUE WITH THE SWORN ANSWER OF AN INDIVIDUAL  THE IMPORTANT QUESTION IN THIS CASE BY WHICH ALL THE OTHERS ARE MORE OR LESS AFFECTED IS WHETHER AN ANSWER IN EQUITY OF A CORPORATION SWORN TO BY AN OFFICER ON HIS PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE IS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFIT OF THE EQUITY RULE THAT A RESPON SIVE ANSWER IS EVIDENCE ONLY TO BE OVERCOME BY THE TESTIMONY OF TWO WITNESSES OR OF ONE WITNESS WITH CORROBORATING CIRCUMSTANCES OR WHETHER IT IS TO BE REGARDED AS MERE PLEADING  THE PRECISE ORIGIN OF THE RULE HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AMONG TEXT WRITERS AS IS SHOWN BY THE LEARNED REFEREE IN THIS CASE BUT THE REASON FOR IT IS FAIRLY APPARENT CASES IN EQUITY ARE THOSE IN WHICH THE LAW AFFORDS NO ADEQUATE REMEDY THEY ARE THEREFORE EXCEPTIONAL AND BEFORE A PARTY SHOULD BE GRANTED EXCEPTIONAL AND EXTRALEGAL RELIEF HIS CASE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHED CLEARLY IN ISSUES AT LAWV ALL CASES ARE CLEAR IN THEORY IF THERE IS WITNESS AGAINST WITNESS AND OATH AGAINST OATH THE JURY DECIDES

NOTES OF CASES 147 EXAMINER THE MATTER AS THE EARLY EXPRESSION WAS IS IN EQUILIBRIO AND THERE IS NO CLEAR CASE FOR THE CHANCELLOR TO ACT UPON THE COMPLAINANT HAVING THE BURDEN OF PROOF MUST FAIL BUT WHATEVER ITS ORIGIN THE RULE IS SETTLED AND IS A PART OF UNIVERSAL EQUITY PRACTICE THE RESPONDENT IS BROUGHT INTO COURT WITHOUT HIS CON SENT AND PUT TO COMPULSORY ANSWER AND DISCLOSURE OF HIS KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBJECT OF THE SUIT FOR THE BENEFIT OF HIS ADVERSARY BY THE ACTION OF THE PLAINTIFF THE TES TIMONY OF DEFENDANT IS THUS MADE EVIDENCE AND IT IS ONLY PROPER AND JUST THAT IF THE PLAINTIFF DOES NOT FIND IT ALL IN HIS FAVOR HE SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO OVERCOME IT BY A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY NO SUFFICIENT REASON HAS BEEN PRESENTED WHY A CORPORATION SHOULD NOT BE ENTITLED TO THE PROTECTION OF THE RULE IT IS SAID THAT A CORPORATION CANNOT ANSWER UNDER OATH BUT ONLY UNDER SEAL THIS IS CONCEDED BUT IT IS PURELY TECHNICAL A CORPORATION CAN ONLY ACT THROUGH THE PERSONS OF ITS OFFICERS OR OTHER AGENTS ITS CORPORATE SEAL IS NOT ACTION BUT ONLY EVIDENCE OF ACTION BY THE PROPER OFFICERS WHEN THEREFORE TO THE ANSWER UNDER SEAL THERE IS ADDED THE OATH OF AN OFFICER ON HIS OWN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE BECOMES A CORPORATE ACT WITH ALL THE ADVANTAGES TO THE PLAINTIFF OF COMPULSORY DISCLOSURE OF THE TRUTH WHICH HE WOULD HAVE HAD IN A SUIT AGAINST AN INDIVIDUAL AND HE SHOULD TAKE SUCH ADVANTAGES IN THE SAME MAN NER CUM ONERE THE POINT HAS NOT BEEN MUCH DISCUSSED IN PENNSYLVANIA BUT THE OPINION OF THIS COURT WAS INDICATED BY THE LATE CHIEF JUSTICE STERRETT IN

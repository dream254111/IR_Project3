OFFICER WHO IS NOT A PARTYEFFECT AS EVIDENCE On a bill in equity against a corpora tion for discovery and account the answer of the defendant corporation was veri fied by the oath of one of its officers on his personal knowledge Held That the defendant is entitled to the benefit of the equity rule that a responsive and verified answer is evidence only to be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or its equivalentKane v Schylkill Fire Ins Co Pa 48 Atl 989 It is well settled that an answer of a corporation under its corporate seal merely is not evidence but mere pleading B e 0 B Co v Wheeling 13 Gratt 62 Roanoke St B Co v Iickcs 96 Va 510 UTnion Bank v Geary 5 Pet 99 Lovell v S S Mill Assn 6 Paige 54 Hence as held in Roanoke St B Co v Hicks supra a bill of discovery cannot be maintained against a corporation un less one of its officers supposed to be personally cognizant of the facts as to which discovery is sought be made a codefendant and required to answer under oath The latter case is not authority however for the principle that if the defendant instead of demurring had voluntarily answered under the oath of one of its officers familiar with the facts as in the principal case such answer would not have been accorded the same weight as the verified answer of an individual defendant The precise question decided in the prinepal casenamely the effect of an answer by a corporationi sworn to by an officer as of his personal knowledge though himself not a party defendant seems seldom to have arisen On principle the decision in the principal case seems to be sound It has the sanction of a previous Pennsylvania case Waller v Coal Co 191 Pa 193 43 Atl 235 and of the Supreme Court of the United States Carpenter v Insurance Co 4 How 219 If the oath of an officer who is made a party defendant not because of his in terest in the suit but merely for purposes of discovery entitles the answer to the benefit of the usual equity rule no reason is perceived why a similar oath bv an146 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER June officer not made a party is not of equal weight as an instrument of evidence The object of making the officer a party is of course to compel him to answerbut if he makes the necessary disclosure under oath without compulsion this should not affect the evidentiary character of the answer It may be objected to this that when the plaintiff makes the officer a party de fendant and calls for discovery he thereby accredits his veracity and agrees to accept his answer as evidence As shown however in Thornton v Gordon 2 Rob Va 721 this is not the foundation of the rule under which an answer in chancery is made an instrument of evidence though so suggested by Judge Story 2 Story Eq Jurisp 1528 for if such were the reason the plaintiff might dis claim confidence in the defendant and by waiving oath or discovery deprive the answer of its evidentiary value under the equity rule But the Supreme Court of Appeals in this State has in several cases distinctly repudiated this reasoning and held that in the absence of statute the plaintiff cannot deprive the defend ant of the advantage of his sworn answer by waiving oath or disclaiming discovery that the rule making the sworn answer evidence is a rule of the forum by which all parties are bound who invoke the jurisdiction of equity Thornton v Gordon supra Jones v Abraham 75 Va 466 There is a singular dearth of authority or of discussion in the text books on the precise question involved in the principal case We have examined Thomp son Morawetz Clark Taylor and Elliott on Corporations Dillon on Municipal Corporations Storys Equity Pleading Daniells Chancery Practice Bartons Chancery Practice Merwins Equity and Equity Pleading Shipmans Equity Pleading the various Digests including the Century without finding discussion or authority In 1 Enc P1  Pr 956957 two cases are cited on the point namely Carpenter y Insurance Company supra and Van Wyck v Norvell 2 Humph Tenn 192the latter apparently contra The following extract from the opinion of Mitchell J in the principal case seems to justify the conclusion reached and to establish on a sound basis the right of a corporation to demand that its responsive answer in chancery verified by the oath of one of its officers personally cognizant of the facts though not a party defendant shall be treated as of equal evideutiary value with the sworn answer of an individual  The important question in this case by which all the others are more or less affected is whether an answer in equity of a corporation sworn to by an officer on his personal knowledge is entitled to the benefit of the equity rule that a respon sive answer is evidence only to be overcome by the testimony of two witnesses or of one witness with corroborating circumstances or whether it is to be regarded as mere pleading  The precise origin of the rule has been the subject of difference of opinion among text writers as is shown by the learned referee in this case But the reason for it is fairly apparent Cases in equity are those in which the law affords no adequate remedy They are therefore exceptional and before a party should be granted exceptional and extralegal relief his case should be established clearly In issues at lawv all cases are clear in theory If there is witness against witness and oath against oath the jury decides which to believe and finds a verdict for one party or the other There is no room for doubt But in equity if there is oath against oath ordinarily on paper by depositions or testimony before an1901 NOTES OF CASES 147 examiner the matter as the early expression was is in equilibrio and there is no clear case for the chancellor to act upon The complainant having the burden of proof must fail But whatever its origin the rule is settled and is a part of universal equity practice The respondent is brought into court without his con sent and put to compulsory answer and disclosure of his knowledge on the subject of the suit for the benefit of his adversary By the action of the plaintiff the tes timony of defendant is thus made evidence and it is only proper and just that if the plaintiff does not find it all in his favor he should be required to overcome it by a preponderance of evidence to the contrary No sufficient reason has been presented why a corporation should not be entitled to the protection of the rule It is said that a corporation cannot answer under oath but only under seal This is conceded but it is purely technical A corporation can only act through the persons of its officers or other agents Its corporate seal is not action but only evidence of action by the proper officers When therefore to the answer under seal there is added the oath of an officer on his own knowledge the whole becomes a corporate act with all the advantages to the plaintiff of compulsory disclosure of the truth which he would have had in a suit against an individual and he should take such advantages in the same man ner cum onere The point has not been much discussed in Pennsylvania but the opinion of this court was indicated by the late Chief Justice Sterrett in Riegel v Insurance Co 153 Pa 134 143 25 Atl 1070 and in Waller v Coal Co 191 Pa 193 202 203 43 Atl 235 an express ruling in accordance with our present views was made by the court below and necessarily by this court in affirming the decree on his opinion  The learned referee was of opinion that the very great weight of American authority is contrary to the view of appellant but the authorities do not sustain him If we take out of the list of citations those which dear with answers under corporate seal only there is no uniformity shown and in the weightiest authority the Supreme Court of the United States the practice is settled in accordance with our views Carpenter v Insurance Co 4 How 219 11 L Ed 931 We are there fore of opinion that the ruling of the referee was erroneous and the tenth assign ment must be sustained By Va Code see 3281 Acts 18934 p 15 the plaintiff may in his bill waive an answer under oath in which case the answer is mere pleading Milihizer v McKinley

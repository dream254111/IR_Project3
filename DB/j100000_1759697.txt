j100000,Science,1759697,Manayunkia Speciosa,i300303,762 SCIE endocarp is found thick horny and in all respects like that of J nigra The lower por tion of the shell projects into the lower sec tion of the nut and resembles the point of a butternut The engraving is from a carefully executed drawing representing the nut of inat ural size The matter as above presented is left in the hands of those more familiar with subjects in teratology There is no doubt that in the crossfertilization of plants we may have a deviation firom the parent form even in the development of the seed thus fertilized or in its surrounding parts Some strawberry growers are very careful what  perfect varie ties are grown among their pistillate sorts to fertilize them The fleshy receptacle which is the edible portion of the strawberry is more remote from the ovules which are fertilized on its surface than the covering of a shellbark or walnut is from the embryo within HIybridization between closely related gen era is well established in several cases Sachs mentions that it has been observed between species of Lychnis and Silene Rhododendron and Azalea Rhododendron and Rhodora Azalea and Rhodora Rhododendron and Kal mia Aegilops and Triticum and between Echinocactus Cereus and Phylocactus The two genera Juglans and Carya compose a small order of closely related species A study of the generic characters as set down in the classification of these species does not reveal any more striking difference than that shown in the exocarp The male and female flowers are separated on the same tree monoecious and pollen must pass from flower to flower This fertilizingdust is produced in great abun dance and the distance between the black walnut and the pecan or even the shellbark is easily traversed by the pollen There is probably no difficulty in the way of hybridiz ing from a difference of time in the flowering of the species BYRON D IALSTED New York Oct 26 1883 MANA YUNKIA SPECIOSA INx a paper illustrated with a plate recently pre sented to the Academy of natural sciences of Philadel phia Professor Joseph Leidy describes Manayunkia as a cephalobranchiate annelid living in fresh water the only one of the order yet discovered not living in the ocean It was found with the equally renarkable polyzoan Urnatella with its tubes of mud attached to the same stones in the Schuylkill River at Phila delphia It was first noticed and a brief descrip tion given of it in the Proceedings of the academy in 1858 N CE  VOL II No 45 Manayunkia is nearly related to the marine genus Fabricia with a species of which described by Pro fessor Verrill the writer compared it through speci mens collected at Newport RI and Gloucester Mass Manayunkia has not been observed elsewhere until recently when it was found by Mr Edward Potts attached to a fragment of pine bark from EggHarbor River New Jersey The tubes of Manayunkia are simple or compound and in one instance five tubes branched and were pendent from a common stock in a candelabralike manner The little worm is very active and sen sitive and on the sliglitest disturbance withdraws into its tube WhIen quiet it protrudes its head and spreads its cephalic tentacles or branchiae The ma ture worm is three or four millimetres long and is di vided into twelve segments including the head The color is olivegreenish due to the bright green blood circulating in the vessels of the alirnal The head is furnished with a pair of coiispicuous eyes and supports a lateral pair of lophophores each provided with sixteen cylindrical tentacles invested with ac tively moving cilia and closely resembling those of the polyzoa The segments succeeding the head are pro vided with lateral fascicles of locomotive setae and in addition except the first one are further provided with fascicles of pedal hooks The seventh segment is much larger than any of the others and further differs from them in being greatly expanded in front so that it gave rise to the idea that the worlmi undergoes division thouglh the process was at no time observed The intestine is quite simple The chief portions of the vascular system consist in a vast sinus enclosing the intesti nal canal giving off lateral pairs of branches to the segments and a large vessel which extends from each side of the head into one of the tentacles which is larger than the others The blood is bright green and is observed to be incessantly pumped into and expelled from the larger pair of tentacles Ovaries occupy the segments from the fourth to the sixth in clusive Organs supposed to be the testes extend from within the head into the third segment Manayunkia lays its eggs and rears its young within its own tube The young measuring about three fourths of a millimetre had the body divided into nine segments and each lophopliore provided with four tentacles In the species of Fabricia of our coast the number of segments of the body is the same as in Manayun kia but the lophophores supporting the tentacles instead of being simple are trilobed or trifurcate Fabricia has eyesin the tail or last segmnent as well as in the head which is not the case with Mana yunkia DRAIlNAiGE SYSTEM AND LOESS

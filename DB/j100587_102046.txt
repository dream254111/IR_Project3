LISTER M D E S R LOND DE FONTIBUS MEDICATIS ANGLIAE EXERCITATIO ALTERA LONDI NI IN OCTAV 1684 A LETTER FROM THE LEARNED AND INGENIOUS MR WILL MOLYNEUX SECRETARY TO THE SOCIETY OF DUBLIN TO WILL MUSGRAVE L L B FELLOW OF NEW COLLEDGE AND SECRETARY TO THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF OXFORD FOR ADVANCEMENT OF NATURAL KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING LOUGH NEAGH IN IRELAND AND ITS PETRIFYING QUALITYS S I R IN ANSWER TO THE OXFORD SOCIETYS QUERY CONCERNING OUR LOUGH NEAGH AND ITS PETRIFYING QUALITYS I MAKE THIS RETURN 1 THAT IT IS GENERALLY AGREED BY ALL THE INHABITANTS THERE ABOUTSTHAT IT HAS THAT QUALITY BUT YET I HAVE A LETTER BY ME FROM A GENTLEMAN UNKNOWN TO ME AND THEREFORE I WILL NOT PROMISE FOR HIS CREDIT OR THE FIDELITY OF HIS ENQUIRY THAT THAT POSITIVELY DENIES THAT THERE IS ANY SUCH THING BUT ASSERTS THAT THE STONES THAT ARE BROUGHT TO US AS PETRYFYD WOOD ARE FOUND DEEP IN SAND HILLS IN THE COUNTRY ADJOYNING TO THE LOUGH ALLEDGING AS AN EXPERIMENT THAT A GENTLEMAN OF HIS ACQUAIN TANCESTUCK AN OAK STAKE INTO THE LOUGH TWENTY YEARS AGO WHICH THERE REMAINS UNALTERD BUT I CONCEIVE THIS ASSERTION TO BE WITHOUT GROUND AND THE EXPERIMENTS FALSLY MADE FOR FIRST TIS AGREEDBY ALL THAT NO WOOD WILL PETRIFIE IN THIS LOUGHEXCEPT HOL LYSO THAT HIS APPLYING AN OAK STAKE WAS IMPROPER SECONDLYFOR THEIR BEING FOUND IN SAND HILLS THEY MAY EASILY BE SUPPOSED IN PROCESS OF TIME TO HAVE BEEN BROUGHT THITHER AND LEFT THERE FOR I DO NOT FIND HE ASSERTS THAT THEY ARE FOUND SO DEEP IN THOSE HILLS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN DUG UP AND THIRDLY IT IS WITH SOME PROBABILITY ASSERTED AND I HAVE A LETTER FROM AN UNDERSTAN DING PERSON THEREABOUTS CONFIRMING IT THAT THE EARTH ABOUT LOUGH NEAGH HAS THIS PETRIFYING QUALITY AND WE MAY WELL IMAGINE THAT THESE SAND HILLS ESPECIALLY ARE NOT DESTITUTE THEREOF FOR553 FOR I AM CERTAINLY INFORMED THAT A GENTLEMAN OF THECOUNTRY A BOUT THIS LOUGH A LITTLE BEFORE THE REBELLION CUT DOWN SOME TIMBER FOR BUILDING AND AMONGST OTHERS CUT DOWN A LARGE HOLLY TREE BUT BEING DIVERTED BY THE REBELLION FROM BUILDING HIS TIMBER LAY ON THE GROUND IN THE PLACE WHERE IT WAS FELLD UPON THE BANKS OF THE LOUGH ALL THE MISERABLE TIME OF THE WAR TILL AT LAST THE KINGDOM BEING SETLED THE GENTLEMAN WENT TO LOOK FOR HIS TIMBER AND FOUND THE OTHER TIMBER OVERGROWN WITH MOSS AND THE HOLLY PETRIFIED THO THE WATER OF THE LOUGH HAD NEVER REACHD IT 2 I QUERY WHETHER THE HOLLY IT SELF THAT GROWS UPON THE BANKS OF THIS LOUGH MAY NOT BE MORE APT TO BE  THEN THE SAME WOOD GROWING OTHER WHERE AND BROUGHT THI THER AND PUT INTO THE LOUGH FOR CERTAINLY IF THE GROUND HAS THIS QUALITY THIS IS VERY LIKELY TO FOLLOW 3 THAT WHAT WE CALL LOUGH NEAGH STONE WAS ONCE WOODIS MOST PROBABLE ON THESE ACCOUNTS FIRST IT WILL NOT  WITH ACIDS WHICH IS A PROPERTY OBSERVED BY DR GREW ON SOME PETRIFYED WOODSIN THE MUSAEUM R S P 270 THO THE DR DOES THERE MAKE IT AN ARGUMENT FOR HIS SUSPECTING THEY ARE LAPIDES SUI GENERIS SECONDLY THE LOUGH NEAGH STONE WILL BURN AND FLAME AND THE SMOAK OF IT SMELLS LIKE THE SMOAK OF WOOD THIRDLY WHEN BURNT IT BETRAYS THE VERY GRAIN OF WOOD WITH THE OTHER VES SELS BELONGING TO VEGETABLES BUT THAT WHICH CONFIRMS ME A BOVE ALL THAT THESE STONES WERE ONCE WOOD IS BECAUSE I HAVE MANY OF THEM BY ME OF VARIOUS DEGREES OF PETRIFICATION I SUP POSE ACCORDING TO THE TIME THEY REMAINED IN THE WATER WHICH I COULD NEVER HEAR JUSTLY DETERMINED SOME THAT HAVE CLEARLY LOST THE COLOUR OF WOODAND ARE BECOME PERFECTLY BLACK AND VE RY HARD OTHERS THAT ARE NOT SO BLACK NOR HARD BUT ONE MORE ESPECIALLY WAS SENT ME ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHICH IS A PARALLELE PIPED OF ABOUT FOUR INCHES LONG AND AN INCH THICK CUT I SUP POSE WHILST WOOD INTO THAT SHAPE PURPOSELY WHOSE OUTWARD COAT IS VERY BLACK AND SMOOTH BUT THIS IS MEERLY SUPERFICIAL FOR BEING CLEFT LONGWISE THROUGH THE MIDDLE WHICH IT SUFFERD FAR MORE EASILY THEN THAT WHICH IS MORE THROUGHLY PETRIFYED I THERE DISCOVERED THE WHOLE BODY PERFECTLY OF THE COLOUR AND GRAIN OF HOLLY FOR I CAN SCRAPE IT WITH MY NAIL BUT WHAT WAS MOST SURPRISING IN IT WAS THE DISCOVERY OF THE PITHAS PLAIN LY AND AS PERFECTLY DISTINCT IN COLOUR AND TEXTURE FROM THE REST BUT IT ALSO WAS PETRIFYD AS IT COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN SEEN IN THE NATURAL WOOD THAT THIS PIECE WHEN WOOD WAS CUT IN Q 2 TO554 TO THIS SHAPE ON PURPOSE TO TRY THE EXPERIMENT I AM INDUCED TO BELIEVE ON THESE ACCOUNTS FIRST NO TREE GROWS IN THE SHAPE OF A PARALLELOPIPED AND THAT THIS IS NOT A STONE APPEARS FROM THE IN WARD TEXTURE DIFFERING SO MUCH FROM THE OUTWARD COAT AND FROM THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE OUTWARD COAT AND RUFFNESS IN WARDLY WHICH SMOOTHNESS COULD NEVER BE INDUCED SINCE IT WAS A STONE FOR IF YOU GRIND IT SO AS IN THE LEAST TO WEAR OFF THE OUTWARD BLACK COAT THE ROUGH WHITE INSIDE SHEWS IT SELF IMMEDIATELY 4 WHAT THE LEARNED PHYSICIAN ANSELM BOETIUS ASSERTS IN HIS HISTORIA LAPIDUM  GEMMARUM IS CERTAINLY FALSE VIZ THAT THAT PART OF THE WOOD THAT IS BURIED IN THE MUD WILL BECOME IRON THAT PART TOUCHD BY THE WATER BECOMES STON STON AND THAT ABOVE THE WATER REMAINS WOOD FOR I NEVER HAVE SEEN OR COULD HEAR OF ANY PART OF THE STONE IN THE LEAST RESEMBLING IRON 5 I HAVE USED SOME ENDEAVOURS TO PROCURE A PIECE OF THIS LOUGH NEAGH STONE TO WHICH THE WOOD WAS YET FASTNED BUT I NE VER COULD ATTAIN IT THO SOME ASSERT THEY HAVE SEEN PIECES 2 OR 3 FOOT LONG WITH ABOUT 8 OR 10 INCHES OF STONE AND THE REST WOOD THO I AM APT TO BELIEVE THIS MAY BE STRETCHING THE MATTER TOO FAR FOR I CONCEIVE THAT THAT HUMOUR THAT PETRIFIES ONE PART WHEN IT BEGINS TO OPERATE INSINUATES IT SELF SOON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE BODY 6 TIS OBSERVED THAT THIS PETRIFYING QUALITY IS NOT EQUALLY DIF FUSED THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE LOUGH WHICH IS ABOUT 15 OR 16 MILES LONG AND 8 OR 9 MILES BROAD IN ALL PLACES BUT IS MOST STRONG ABOUT THAT PART WHERE THE BLACK WATER A RIVER SO CALLD EMPTYS IT SELF INTO THIS LOUGH THAT IS ABOUT THE SOUTHWEST COR NER AS LIKEWISE TIS SAID TO BE MORE STRONG ABOUT THE EDGES OF THE LOUGH THEN FURTHER INTO THE WATER 7 IT WAS QUERIED A WHILE AGO BY AN INGENIOUS AND LEARN ED MEMBER OF THE ROYAL S MR HALLY WHETHER LOUGH NEAGH STONE WERE NOT MAGNETICAL FOR HE WAS TOLD IT WAS BUT UPON TRYAL I FIND IT IS NOT FOR IT WILL NOT STIR A NEEDLE OR STEEL FILINGS NEITHER WILL IT APPLY TO THE MAGNETIN POWDER OR CALCINED THIS IS ALL THAT OFFERS IT SELF AT PRESENT RELATING TO THE QUERY OF THE OXFORD SOCIETY IF ANY THING MORE OCCUR THEY SHALL BE IN FORMED THEREOF BY THEIR MOST OBLIGED HUMBLE SERVANT WILLIAM MOLYNEUX A LET

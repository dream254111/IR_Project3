j100358,The School Review,1075395,An Experiment in Teaching English,i244549,AN EXPERIMENT IN TEACHING ENGLISH SEVERAL years ago there fell to the lot of the writer an op portunity to teach English in the high school of a country town The town was a pretty amiable town the school too was cheer ful and amiable though shamefully run down from five years of change misrule and no rule Set in the heart of a coal field our population was a mixed one and we sometimes had in our schoolroom representatives of five or six nationalities many foreignborn though under seventeen years of age The public schools of the borough served a population of about five thou sand but Polish Italian Slav and Hungarian families rarely left their children in school beyond the upper grammar grades We hardly lacked variety however as things stood and a small admixture of the old Yankee stock children of welltodo fami lies of transplanted New Englanders with six generations of books and brains behind them furnished another contrast Such was our material moreover it was raw material To such a degree had custom stated the infinite variety of grammar school routine that our thirteenyearolds came up to us from the eighth grade veritable little Bourbons They had learned noth ing and they had forgotten nothing since the days of the fifth grade and Bourbonlike they didnt propose to begin They would not read aloud intelligibly far less intelligently from anything but the Readers which they had by heart Their spell ing knew no law anarchy prevailed among the parts of speech the commonest rules of grammar belonged only between the brown covers of a textbook and never by any chance were allowed to come out to hinder people in the affairs of practical life In three successive years three grammarschool teachers had exacted tribute to the amount of two  compositions  a year on such topics as Chalk  Rivers A Rainy Day Evange line  Clouds  Farming and Wild Birds Very naturally no one of the sixtyfive little Bourbons had ever guessed that written work aimed first and foremost to train the mind to 666AN EXPERIMENT IN TEACHING ENGLISH think clearly and straight to the point whether for speech or writing A composition was a thing one wrote when the teacher required it it was copied in a fair hand with a fine pen on glazed paper had an inchandahalf margin at the left the title written as handsomely as possible at the top of the page had two or three paragraphs each beginning with a capital letter beautifully flourished each indented carefully each owing its very existence to a desire on the penmans part to  make the page look pretty Sometimes the whole production was a single sentence linked with fifteen or eighteen ands and buts the paragraphs with their spacing and initial capitals by no means breaking the peace ful continuity of the whole merely pleasing the artistic sense of the reader by beauty of line and mass and tailing off modestly with a noncommittal comma after the last word to be succeeded by another installment of capitals and conjunctions on the next line In mental training the writers of these precious composi tions were again pitifully lacking and conspicuously in literary matters In common with the other fifty pupils of the high school who had come through the same mill in their day the newly promoted class devoutly believed Longfellow the only very great poet of the English race Holmes Lowell Whittier and Bryant receiving a mild sort of honorable mention They had read in the straight and narrow path of school duty Evangeline Hiawatha The Courtship of Miles Standish The Rainy Day The Psalm of Life Snowbound Maud Muller Thanatopsis with short extracts from the prose of Webster and Emerson They had read enough they thought they resisted determinedly the suggestion that they read something more In moments of heart to heart confidences one learned from the more outspoken mem bers that the class just cant bear any more poetry 0 Miss  its so dull And prose was almost as bad so far as school selections went though in private the girls read Edna Lyall and the classics of Bertha M Clay while the boys carried Henty books under their arms to hide the bulging rolls of Diamond Dick Yesse yames Luck and Pluck Work and Win Old Sleuth and all the tribe of pennydreadfuls that distended their 667THE SCHOOL REVIEW coat fronts In a town that had no public library and no book store where people live well and dress well and are content to own no books was it not a deplorable situation  The present writer was fresh from college used to living among books and full of that certain zealous energy which belongs to one trying the paces of a hobby or experimenting to testing a long cherished theory For I had a theory that narra tive was the easiest and simplest method of teaching children over seven years of age as the kindergarten appeal to the body through the mind is called the easiest under that age that nar rative is the natural habit of thought and speech of most children and young persons and that narrative is therefore the most purely natural of all literary forms and that lastly the literary education of young minds is best begun and carried along by means of narrative until the critical sense and constructive in stinct are unconsciously developed Here was the best of oppor tunity to try my theory 1 was in sole charge of both the history and the English to change arrange and rearrange buy books and discard books at discretion The sixtyfive were for the most part shrewd sensible healthy children readywitted and good tempered So indeed were most of their elders of the three higher classes but for this report of my experiment I pur pose to confine myself to the progress of the youngest grade A thorough course in English grammar five appointments a week with a good textbook was shamefully necessary that was routine work drill drill and drill again and nine months was none too long a term for the work One appointment a week was dedi cated to composition work but under one disguise or another work in written composition was exacted daily The formal study of rhetoric and English literature was postponed indefi nitely and we began instead a nondescript course of reading writing class discussion and criticism which stood on the school program as  Classics a safe name that bound the faculty to nothing in particular With the sixtyfive divided into two sections and provided witha book apiece we began to read The Lady of the Lake The strong narrative interest of the book was a qualification of first 668AN EXPERIMENT IN TEACHING ENGLISIH importance it was as different as possible from Evangeline or Hiawatha in the second place thirdly I wanted to work the class hard for a month or two in a fresh line and the necessary historical references afforded just such a burden as their young shoulders needed lastly the poetryworn ears and brains were to discover for themselves classify and memorize the simpler elements of versification a quest nowhere more easily satisfied than in the varied verse forms and stanzas of this book For the first few days it was uphill work Omitting the Spenserian stanzas of the introduction we began at once the story of the hunt reading aloud in class without previous preparation and not more than three out of thirtythree could read six lines with out outrageous mistakes in pronunciation while the simple rhythm of the verse was lost altogether Even the fluent readers who could pronounce the unusual words had little idea of the sense of the text and in the general darkness to order a word by word translation with dictionaries would have been to add despair to discouragement With the air of making the best of a bad matter we read doggedly on a few lines at a time and cleared up dark passages as we could for the first few days But presently pocketdictionaries began to appear all unbidden and as the unlucky victim of the moment stumbled on toward a formidable meaningless unpronounceable word some lines ahead one heard the dictionary leaves flutter and at the crisis eight or ten enterprisingyoung persons could tell him how to pronounce it This was the beginning and from this stage the lump leavened itself most satisfactorily To know the meaning of outlandish words became a matter of distinction to pronounce anything and everything correctly in reading was no more than proper pride Presently too the interest of the story the direct and simple appeal to imagination gained the mastery over prejudice and indolence alike As soon as this had happened it became safe to comment upon particular bits of description for their charm their vividness to question how this or that bit of workmanship reacted upon the readers mind and what the secret was that made unlike matters interesting by the simple device of group 669THE SCIHOOL REVIEW ing them closely together The discovery that iambic tetrameter and trochaic tetrameter differed in sound because of a very real structural difference left the class fairly swollen with pride so that the graphic representation of these verses was mere play and the rather difficult terminology almost remembered itself The true inwardness and reasonableness of rhyme was a puzzle that lasted us through weeks and the difference between correct verse and good poetry remained a matter of dispute to the very end The school library of reference books was ransacked for information about Scottish history in general and the Douglas family in particular and Scotts own notes upon customs and folklore aroused a natural curiosity about his personality and the details of his life After about eight weeks of this kind of study and of almost daily practice in putting some ideas on paper the written work of the class began to improve Con junctions diminished and periods and semicolons crept in Here and there in the class individuals formed a habit of coming to the point in a few words and of writing about one thing at a timea tremendous step in advance New words slipped from The Lady of the Lake into private keeping and great was the innocent pride of the borrowers in displaying them here and there And all of these desirable things came about because the children were teaching themselves unconsciously while engrossed in the story So far the theory was working well Then at the end of twelve weeks came the term examina tion I laughed over the papers and scowled and laughed again but I read them with an interest that I never thought to feel in sixty papers on the same subject Nearly every page was stated clearly enough to make the writers thought plain which was in itself a substantial good but what an expanse of intelligent ignorance stood revealed In the same paper with a piece of discerning criticism of the plot structure and a brief character sketch which showed real grasp and penetration occur red these annotations  A Bard is an article of Highland dress or a weapon for defense A Druid is a string of colored lights that they used to hang out on the hilltops when one of their chiefs or the head of a Highland family died to let the people 670AN EXPERIMENT IN TEACHING ENGLISH know Another a painstaking conscientious student is the authority for the following definitions Poetry said she voic ing her own opinion often heretofore maintained in class discus sions against the faction who would ascribe all honor and glory to meter and rhyme alone is language put into print that is excited by imagination Meter is Here memory and cour age alike flagged and she dishonorably had recourse to a pocket Webster all too much abridged coming out triumphantly with this treasure Meter is a measure of harmony at a length of nearly thirtynine and a half inches In her hurry a semicolon had been lost and the preposition at fell into place by asso ciation her newly acquired dictionary habit then prevailed against the conviction that the definition stood for no idea and the paper was handed in as written Fresh from The Lady of the Lake with their imaginations still kindled by their taste of historical fiction and antiquarian lore the class went gallantly through the Sketch Book undertaking more and more independent library work as time went on till one beheld the spectacle of children who had never heard of Tennyson laboriously trying to spell out verses of The Kinges Quhair or distractedly thumbing Grays Garden and Field Botany to find out what kind of thing was the spray of gillieflower carried into the tower window by the dove back in those days when Windsor Castle was both a fortress and a prison Much of it was effort to little purpose of course but because the free use of books is a precious craft to learn I was willing to see them waste a little energy on trifles rather than interrupt their researches and discount their results by illtimed advice The Vicar of Wakefield came next the stimulus of a story renewing at once the somewhat jaded interest of the class Here more than ever before it was profitable and safe to scrutinize the masters workmanship to say  How was it done and Why was this done so I know of no book that affords to a class struggling to write good English such abundant effi cient practical help as this The pleasant simple style the everyday topics the transparent reasonableness with which that wonderful craftsman develops a character introduces an element 67THE SCHOOL REVIE W of pathos or a touch of gayety or uses a contrast are things that a child of thirteen can both admire and profit by Last of all and crowning glory of the year the class came back to the great wizard and read Ivanhoe I am not sure but that Kenilworth or Waverly might have done as well and awak ened the same enthusiasm but certainly no book could have fallen in more neatly with the outside reading which had accom panied the Lady of the Lake and the Sketch Book Douglas of the Bleeding Heart had sent us to Aytouns ballad and the errand of Bruces heart had drawn us further back to investi gate the Crusades The genealogy of James Fitzjames and the prisoner of Windsor had given us an interest in the English royal house Then the crusading templar whose effigy Irving saw in the country church lying with his feet crossed had pro voked interest in the Order of the Temple In Ivanhoe all these lines converged and there was beside fighting and bloodshed enough to satisfy the devotees of Jesse James and Diamond Dick  while Rebecca and Rowena associating only with court favorites and twice rescued by royalty itself far outshone the paler splendors of those modern sentimentalists who never involve the heroine in a siege and rarely do better for her than an earl During the five weeks that we spent on Ivanhoe tradi tion and decorum were so far forgotten that the classes actually groaned when the class bell ended the recitation They cheer fully undertook to read thirty pages and look up all necessary references therein as their daily task to be prepared from one days recitation to the next though early in September they had protested that one hundred lines of the Lady of the Lake was a burden greater than they could bear It was a fury of enthusiasm that possessed them growing by what it fed on During all the later work on the Vicar Ivanhoe and the final reviews and comparisons of our years work I noticed a sur prising development of the critical faculty and of standards of literary judgment I had believed strongly when I undertook this course in the receptiveness and innate reasonableness of the ordinary child if properly approached Yet I had taken it for granted that all literary judgments were the acquirements of 672AN EXPERIMENT IN TEACHING ENGLISH later years and so highly artificial in their very nature as to depend upon a deliberate study of criticism for existence Here were these raw childrenunlettered almostreadinga few booksand questioning their structure now and then but receiving scarcely an opinion from me or from any outsider suddenly commending and condemning points in characterdrawing plotstructure pro portion and style with a keenness of insight and a breadth of judgment that need not discredit a Coleridge or a Hazlitt True the form of their comments was often crude and uncouth but the idea was there Moreover they were surprisingly unani mous on most points a trifling incident given undue length and importance in a story did not come off with one protest or with twenty They were the keenest critics on the score of proba bility that I ever found the veriest trifles were weighed and remembered and their researches now and again led to an odd discovery as for example that the ages of the younger chil dren of the Primrose family if tested and applied at every turn quite upset the chronology of the book For the Lady of the Lake we had a map of the Trosachs and Loch Lomond for Ivanhoe we traced King Richards return from Palestine through his captivity and on to England followed Cedric and Ivanhoe and the templar about on the map of England and even adorned our blackboards with ground plans of the Ashby tilt yard and the castle of Torquilstone drawn as accurately as might be Upon comparing the June examinations with the set of papers which I had found so encouraging in December I may own to an honest satisfaction and pride The improvement in thought and in language was marked What was more the improvement did not mean a temporary concession a temporary imitation of the teachers tone in order to earn a higher grade rather the pupils had improved themselves the change marking an inward growth which was more than a temporary gain In addition some of them had acquired a taste for wellwritten books and could not return to the old favorites I learned later on of several such cases In looking back upon this experiment I am more than ever convinced of the value of teaching English whether rhetoric 673674 THE SCHOOL REVIEW composition or literature in connection with and by means of the reading of some vivid narrative To appeal to the imagina tion and to the order of thought which is natural to the mind is to discover a line of least resistance And if we can teach along a line of least resistance is it not a gain E S JOHNSON PITTSTON PA

78 JUNE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTERUNIFORMITY OF LAWS BY THE EXPERTS WHO HAVE WRITTEN ON THE TOPIC MAY SURELY INSPIRE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THE WORK IS THOROUGHLY DONE   A MORE USEFUL OR THOROUGHLY PRE PARED STATUTE ON COMMERCIAL LAW WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO FIND ALL THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES AND ESSENTIAL DEFINITIONS OF THE LAW ON COMMERCIAL PAPERTHE LAW IN SHORT OF SOME TEN THOUSAND REPORTED CASESIS IN SUBSTANCE CONDENSED INTO THIRTYSIX PAGES THE DISPUTED POINTS AND VARIANT LAWS WHOSE DISCUSSION OCCU PIES SO LARGE A SHARE OF TWO AND THREEVOLUMED TREATISES ON THE SUBJECT ARE DE CIDED AND HARMONIZED THIS DECISION AND HARMONY IS NOT THE DICTUM OR OPINION OF ONE MAN OR ONE BODY OF MEN OR ONE STATE OR ONE COUNTRY THE ENGLISH BILL ORIGINALLY DRAFTED BY JUDGE CHALMERS PASSED BY THE COMMITTEES OF BOTH

CHANCELLOR OF ENGLAND WRITES AS TO THE ENG LISH LAW I DO NOT THINK THAT THERE IS ANY DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN THIS COUNTRY ON THE SUBJECT THERE IS I BELIEVE A COMMON AGREEMENT THAT THE CODE EMBODYING THE LAW OF NEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS HAS BEEN OF GREAT UTILITY IT HAS GIVEN RISE TO VERY FEW QUESTIONS REQUIRING DECISIONS BY THE COURTS AND IT HAS PUT BEYOND CON TROVERSY NOT A FEW THAT WERE IN DOUBT IT HAS BEEN ADOPTED ONE AFTER ANOTHER BY ALL OUR SELFGOVERNING COLONIES AND THE CODE IS NOW APPLICABLE TO THE WHOLE OF THE UNITED DOMINIONS THIS IS OF ITSELF NO SMALL TESTIMONY IN ITS FAVOR A SIMI LAR CODE FOR THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WILL BE I THINK A BOON FOR THE COM MERCIAL COMMUNITY OF BOTH COUNTRIES MR JUSTICE CHALMERS THE DRAFTSMAN OF THE ENGLISH ACT NOW A LEGISLATIVE MEMBER OF THE VICEROYS COUNCIL IN INDIA IN A LETTER WRIT TEN FROM SIMLA IN MAY 1896 CONGRATULATES MR CRAWFORD ON HIS ABLE WORK AND ARTHUR COHEN ESQ Q C SAYS THE LANGUAGE OF YOUR BILL IS SINGULARLY FELICITOUS IT IS MORE CLEAR CONCISE LESS STIFF AND ARTIFICIAL THAN THAT OF OUR BILLS OF EXCHANGE ACT AND IN THIS RESPECT ONE BY NO MEANS UNIMPORTANT YOUR DRAFT IS AN IMPROVEMENT ON OUR ACT THIS ACT SO RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN COMMISSIONERS HAS AL READY BEEN PASSED IN THE STATES OF NEW YORK CONNECTICUT COLORADO FLORIDA MARYLAND AND VIRGINIA ITS ADOPTION HAS BEEN URGED BY THE GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS IN HIS

and commercial relations of the States of the Union they are as to each other foreign save in those particulars wherein they are made one by the Federal Constitution This status still exists despite the trend towards a more complete poli tical unity which has been on the whole steadily but sometimes inter mittently in progress since our federal life began The increased facility of communication furnished by the great forces of steam and electricity has served to make only more apparent the inconvenience of the diversity of laws upon subjects of common interest Various papers were from time to time read before the American Bar Associa tion demonstrating the confusion arising from variant and conflicting laws in the different States on matters of common interest but noth ing practical was done in the way of remedying or mitigating the evil until in 1888 the State Bar Association of Tennessee began a move ment for a conference of commissioners to be appointed by the several States for the promotion of uniform State legislation In 1889 the movement was taken up by the American Bar Association and in 1890 a statute was passed by the State of New York creating a com mission of three to cooperate with similar commissions to be appointed by other States Her sister States have followed suit until up to the present time more than thirty States have appointed like commissions A conference of these commissioners on uniform State laws is held annually immediately before the meeting of the American Bar Asso ciation All of the commissioners serve without compensation and some even pay their own expenses incurred in attending the meeting Some of the States however notably New York and New Jersey have made liberal appropriations for the expenses of their commissions The conference of commissioners includes in its membership many lawyers of distinction Its president is Judge Lyman D Brewster of Connecticut a most accomplished jurist recently of counsel for the Tilden heirs in the famous suit in which they overthrew the will of the great Democratic leader The secretaryship is held by Mr Fred eric J Stimson a wellknown Boston lawyer and perhaps the leading American authority upon the statute law of the States who has also 1898 77found time in a busy professional life to give to the public under the nom de plume of J S of Dale several of the most charming works of modern fiction Mr Stimsons colleagues in the commission from Massachusetts are Judge Edmund H Bennett of Taunton the veteran dean of the Boston Law School and editor of the standard American edition of Benjamin on Sales and Mr Leonard A Jones of Boston the author of many widelyknown textbooks Of the eminent lawyers among the commissioners representing the other States are Judge John H Stiness of the Supreme Court of Rhode Island Judge J Franklin Fort of New Jersey and Peter W Meldrim the reform Mayor of Savannah Negotiable paper is the chief medium of commerce it having been estimated that ninetyfive per cent of the commercial transactions of the country are conducted by bills and notes It is therefore manifest how desirable is substantial uniformity throughout the States in the law of negotiable instruments This subject therefore presented an inviting field for the labors of the commissioners In 1896 the conference caused to be drafted an Americanized form of the famous English Bills of Exchange Act which was passed in 1882 and codified the English law of Bills and Notes This work was done by Mr John J Crawford of the New York bar and it will be gratifying to Virginians to know that in the performance of his task Mr Crawford relied upon Daniel on Negotiable Instruments as the chief American authority and has quoted therefrom more freely than from any other work Mr Crawfords draft was published with copious notes and references and along with the English Act This draft was sent to all the State commissioners and to many authorities and experts inviting criticisms and suggestions After receiving such criticisms and suggestions a committee of the State commissioners went over the Act carefully with Mr Crawford and after the Act had been so revised it was presented to the full conference of commissioners who spent several days in its considera tion and recommended the Act as so prepared and perfected for adop tion in the several States Of the Act Judge Brewster says in an article published in the Yale Law Journal in February 1897 The production of a single mind however learned and skillful may well be regarded with distrust but the product of scores of lawyers of Great Britain best qualified to know the law on the subject tested by fourteen years of successful experience and revised by commissioners from thirty States in this country aided 78 June VIRGINIA LAW REGISTERUNIFORMITY OF LAWS by the experts who have written on the topic may surely inspire the confidence that the work is thoroughly done   A more useful or thoroughly pre pared statute on Commercial Law would be difficult to find All the fundamental principles and essential definitions of the law on commercial paperthe law in short of some ten thousand reported casesis in substance condensed into thirtysix pages The disputed points and variant laws whose discussion occu pies so large a share of two and threevolumed treatises on the subject are de cided and harmonized This decision and harmony is not the dictum or opinion of one man or one body of men or one State or one country The English Bill originally drafted by Judge Chalmers passed by the committees of both Houses of Parliament adopted by all of its selfgoverning colonies has had the test of fourteen years experience and the testimony is all one way as to its worth and efficiency Lord Herschell Lord Chancellor of England writes as to the Eng lish law I do not think that there is any difference of opinion in this country on the subject There is I believe a common agreement that the code embodying the law of Negotiable Instruments has been of great utility It has given rise to very few questions requiring decisions by the courts and it has put beyond con troversy not a few that were in doubt It has been adopted one after another by all our selfgoverning colonies and the code is now applicable to the whole of the United Dominions This is of itself no small testimony in its favor A simi lar code for the United States of America will be I think a boon for the com mercial community of both countries Mr Justice Chalmers the draftsman of the English Act now a legislative member of the Viceroys Council in India in a letter writ ten from Simla in May 1896 congratulates Mr Crawford on his able work and Arthur Cohen Esq Q C says The language of your bill is singularly felicitous it is more clear concise less stiff and artificial than that of our Bills of Exchange Act and in this respect one by no means unimportant your draft is an improvement on our Act This Act so recommended by the American commissioners has al ready been passed in the States of New York Connecticut Colorado Florida Maryland and Virginia Its adoption has been urged by the Governor of Massachusetts in his annual message to the legisla ture It has recently unanimously passed the lower House of Con gress as a law for the District of Columbia and will probably pass the Senate also It has been unanimously endorsed by the American Bankers Association The reception of this Act by the various State legislatures will in large measure determine the future of the movement for uniformity of laws The history of the work has been so far one of preparation 79 1898VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER rather than of achievement The policy of the commissioners has been to advance slowly and carefully There is now in preparation for the national conference of commissioners an uniform law of Sales of personal property which will be considered at their approaching meeting in August next Mr Leonard A Jones is the draftsman of this Act It is purposed further to proceed in due time to examine the subjects of Marriage and Divorce Insolvency the form of Notarial Certificates Descent and Distribution of property Acknowledgment of Deeds execution and probate of Wills and other subjects on which uniformity is desirable In a paper read before the American Academy of Political and Social Science of Philadelphia in 1895 Mr Stimson declares that The movement for uniformity of lawsif successful in any degreewould be the most important juristic work undertaken in the United States since the adoption of the Federal Constitution In the more than one hundred years that have elapsed since that time there has been no official effort to obtain greater har mony of law among the States of the Union and it is the first time since the de bates on the Constitution that accredited representatives of the several States have met together to discuss any legal question from a national point of view A momentous act in the drama of the worlds history is now occu pying the stage Within the last few weeks we have seen wrought in our national life a metamorphosis A few hurried events have trans formed us from a people content to manufacture only what we can consume or produce only what we can eat into one of the great factors in the worlds destiny We have definitely assumed the hege mony of the Western Hemisphere and we rank henceforth as one of the great powers of the earth These responsibilities will more closely weld the component parts of our political system and the time is opportune for inaugurating a uniform and homogeneous system of American jurisprudence W P MCRAE Petersburg Va 80 June

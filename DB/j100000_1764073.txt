and regular new things not jumping into existence fully developed and ready for their most advantageous use All this is true of the accumulators or storagebatteries for electricity about which the public has heard for a number of years The principle on which they are based is an old one That an electric current in passing through many chemical solutions would decompose them is a fact shown in every school in the land That store up its electricity The answer to these questions is well given in a paper by George B Prescott jun read at a meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers on Oct 29 There are in use electrical systems for lighting purposes and as every one knows these are mainly of service after the sun goes down and then they are called on for a maximum service for a short time which is followed by a smaller demand during the rest of the night It is patent that such a method of production can not be economical for the plant must be idle or working to but a fraction of its capacity most of the time The accumulator comes in as a storehouse so that the dynamos may be run at an even liii II i I i iI FIG i  ELECTRICAL ACCUMULATOR COMPANYS STORAGEBATTERY when the battery sending the current is removed and the wires rate of production and any spare electricity stored till the extra entering the solution joined a current can be detected in these demand has to be met wires opposite in direction to the original current is also known There is a field then in which accumulators may play an impor The decomposing apparatus shows itself as a storagebattery fromn tant part not in competition with the direct application of the cur which to all intents and purposes electricity runs out again when rent from the dynamo but standing to the electriclight systems the experiment of electrolysis is over What those interested in very much as gasometers do to gasworks The demand for light storagebatteries have been doing is to make this effect of com during the day is not nil yet it is so small that few electriclight mercial value companies are justified in running their dynamos the twentyfour But why should this effect be of commercial value at all  Why hours through But it is calculated that there will be ample sur not use the current from the primary battery itself and not first plus of current to charge the necessary storagebatteries if the326 SCIENCE dynamos are started at 2 PM and work till midnight  a working day of ten hours thus rendering the ordinary electriclight plant efficient the whole day There is another field in whichaccumulators take an active part  that of longdistance lighting now so successfully occupied by the alternating converter system in which the highpotential cur A before entering

varies with their thickness Although there are no obvious theoretical reasons why a single cell of accumulator should not be made sufficiently large to possess any desired capacity there are mechanical con 2 siderations which make it advisable to limit the dimensions of a cell to the extent that it may be conveniently portable Therefore when higher rates or longer discharges than an ordinary cell will give are demanded two or more cells must be connected in par allel When two or more series of cells connected in parallel are to be    7                I     41

and this loss is greater the more rapid the rate of charge and discharge of a storagebattery but this loss added to the cost of the accumulators is not believed to be enough to counterbalance the advantages already mentioned Generally speaking the total current capacity expressed in ampere hours of a single cell of accumulator of the lead leadoxide charged at the same potential it is evident that unless each series is in precisely the same state in respect to residual charge there will be a difference in their electromotive forces and in conse quence less current will flow in those series having higher poten tials than in others While the larger current flowing into the less charged cells will have a tendency to bring up their potentialsSCIENCE to the average it is found in practice that some series will become fully charged sooner than others The details of the methods of use we hope to publish later Our illustrations show the battery and streetcar of the Electric Ac cumulator Company this car as is well known calling for no street wires MAGNOLIAMETAL FOR the last fifty years the soft metal made of copper regulus of antimony and tin invented by Isaac Babbitt of Boston and named for him has been in use for the bearings in machinery as the friction was much reduced by its use ANGLE OF COEFFICiENT OF FRICTION  A  Parts marked T  F A M       i AS       TFI    C t       t

light pressure and slow revolutions of shaft the metals showed little difference but with rapid revolu tions and heavy pressures magnoliametal showed great superiority The foregoing table shows a detailed statement of the tests which occupied an hours time The testingmachine consists of a shaft revolving in suitable bearings between two of which is a steel journal on which the testpiece is

melted and stuck to shaft at end of 45 minutes  deoxidized genuine Babbitt melted and stuck to shaft at end of 55 minutes Mr H G Torrey who has been assayer at the United States Mint New York for thirty years has made several friction tests of journalbearing metals the results of which have just been made known Those selected were magnoliametal and Hoyts genuine Babbitt and the deoxidized genuine Babbitt the latter two sup this platform the weights are placed for producing the pressure There are two knifeedges allowing freedom of the frame and the weighted platform A pan beneath the test journal carrying oil lubricated the bearing Thermometers were inserted in the oil bath and in a recess in the top of the metal In this machine the coefficient of friction is obtained by the angle of deviation of the knifeedge from a vertical line passing through the centre of the journal in terms of the radius of the journal and is independent of the weight entering directly into this calculation Other satisfactory tests have been made by the United States Governmentat the Brooklyn Navy Yard and by Professor R H FIG 2MAGNOLIAMETAL BEARING Smith of Mason College Birmingham England who reports that his tests show the metal to be superior to either Babbitt or gun metal producing less friction keeping the bearing temperature lower requiring less lubrication and possessing greater durability Professor Smith says that the longer the magnoliametal bearing is used and the more severe the duty imposed on it the better be comes its condition Recently this new metal has been introduced in the City of Paris  and the  Augusta Victoria contributing its share in the speed developed by these ocean racers NOVEMBER 15 I889 i    I

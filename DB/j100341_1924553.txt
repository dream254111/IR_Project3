THE YEAR WARREN M PERSONS IN order to interpret correctly the develop ments of the first quarter of I922 it is neces sary to consider them in connection with the business conditions of the periods immediately preceding The period of I4 months from April I920 to May I92I was one of drastic declines in commodity prices and terrific recession of busi ness activity and it resulted in numerous malad justments of prices and production which re quired correction before industry could return to a normal basis The ensuing period of 7 months from June to December I92I was one of read justment It was characterized by diverse move ments of commodity prices but increases of wholesale prices gradually predominated over decreases with the result that general wholesale prices were stabilized and Bradstreets index recorded an advance With price stabilization too came a material increase in general indus trial activity The opening quarter of I922 differs from the last 7 months of I92I in degree rather than kind but the difference is substantial and significant It has offered more pronounced evidence than did the 7 preceding months of progress toward price adjustment particularly in agricultural prices of increase in industrial activity of larger freight movement and of restored confidence in security values The developments of the first three months of the year especially those of February and March are such as we should expect if a substantial upward swing of business activity were being inaugurated Since the first of the year favorable develop ments have outweighted unfavorable Sub stantial advances in the prices of agricultural products have done much to remedy the diffi cult situation of farmers and those who sell to farmers The volume of manufacture in general has not only held the advance made last autumn i a  THE INDEX CHART i b SUPPLEMENTARY INDEX CHART CM Bt6Com ltg Pries 54 St 4 I IA  T   ASUk0tion I AL5cK Prices BBu5ine55  4 I            4   1 3 4 5 6

based upon statistical series for volume prices and money rates while Chart ib is based upon prices and money rates alone as described in the REVIEW for January I922 The forecasts based upon these charts are identical Since July speculative activity and stock prices have increased accompanying the sharp decline in money rates which began some months earlier and continued until December Such movements usually precede and hence forecast substantial increases of business activity and commodity prices curves B and B The upward trends of these curves in the first quarter of I922 are in accordance with this forecast 5354 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS but further increase has been registered despite some declines in paper automobiles textiles and leather When all due allowance is made for longtime tendencies and seasonal influences characteristic of the different lines of industry it is clear that the volume of manufacture was considerably higher in the first quarter of I922 than in the middle of last year Building con struction allowing for seasonal changes main tained the high level reached at the end of I92I and the volume of permits issued during recent months indicates that the building trades are more active than they have been since I9I9 The movement of goods as shown by the num ber of railroad cars loaded increased remarkably during the quarter and the volume of freight is now the largest that ithas been since the first quarter of I920 Among the unfavorable developments we may mention the weakness during January and February of the prices of such important raw materials as iron and steel nonferrous metals hides and rubber the slowing down in the decline of money rates and at the end of the quarter strikes in the textile mills and coal mines These developments however do not appear to be of great significance because the prices of raw materials have strengthened in recent weeks the commercial paper market became easier in March and such strikes as are now in progress are no more likely to prevent recovery of business than similar factors have been in times past Indeed the coal and textile strikes may not improbably result in reduction of operating costs which will help to restore normal relations among various commodity prices Although most industries are more active some are more depressed and certain commodity prices have been weak The spotty character of business recovery in the past io months is un doubtedly the basis for the pessimism which has existed and still exists in many quarters Some observers finding conditions in certain indus tries unsatisfactory do not realize that else where a considerable advance in industry has actually been achieved others are impatient because recovery has been slow and still others are confident that such improvement as has occurred is temporary and will be followed by chronic business depression The fundamental economic situation in the opening quarter of I922 as we find it  a relatively stable general price level low prices of producers goods com pared with consumers goods moderate manu facturing output compared with consumption of goods as indicated by freight movement and retail sales a strong banking condition with declining money rates and buoyant security prices is such as to make improbable the continuation of business depression In other words the existing relations among prices pro duction and consumption of goods mean that strong forces are operating at this time to pro duce business expansion rather than chronic depression In general there are two sets of factors which control business developments first the rela tions among the physical output of goods stocks of goods the movement of goods from producer to consumer and the consumption of goods and second prices wages profits money and credit The present business situation will be considered with respect to these two factors one physical the other financial PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF MANUFACTURES The quantity of goods produced by seven leading groups of manufacturing industries iron and steel lumber paper textiles leather food and tobacco for January was go and for Feb ruary is estimated at 95 relative to normal allowance having been made for seasonal influ ences The low point of output 72 in the de pression of I92I occurred in July and the high point ii8 before the crisis of I920 occurred in January of that year Chart 2 The relative number of workers employed was 82 in January I922 compared with 78 in January I92I and I07 in the middle of I920 The number of employees on the pay roll shows the same major movements as the volume of goods manufactured but the extent of rise and fall of the former series is less than that of the latter because of overtime work in periods of prosperity and parttime work in periods of depression From the evidence just presented the physical output of manufactures which fell from ii8 in I920 to 72 in the middle of I92I has recovered to about 95 These figures showing the relativeREVIEW OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR production of goods considered by themselves are significant but they acquire added meaning when compared with the distribution and con sumption of goods as indicated by railroad car loadings Chart 3 makes such a comparison The average number of cars loaded with all classes of freight after adjusting for seasonal influences fell from II4 in March I920 to a low point of about 9I in July 192I Thus a decline in the adjusted figures from ii8 to 72 in manufacturing output compares with a de cline from II4 to 9I in car loadings for all classes of freight  grain and grain products live stock coal and coke forest products ore merchandise 1 c 1 and miscellaneous In other words a fall of 46 points in manufacturing output was accompanied by a fall of only 23 points in car loadings The decline in the manufacture of goods was much more drastic than the decline in the shipments of all classes of freight But a comparison of changes in manufacturing output with changes in shipments of manufac tures  instead of total shipments  has a more definite bearing on the industrial situation Figures for merchandise and 1 c 1 loadings exduding miscellaneous were not reported in I9I9 but they are available for I920 and I92I For the calendar year I92I this class of freight actually increased about 20 per cent compared with I920 the cars loaded in I92I being about ii millions compared with 9 milions in I920 Tlhis increase in the number of cars however does not indicate precisely the same increase in the tonnage of merchandise moved because the less than car load shipments were heavier in I92I than in I920 on account of handtomouth buying in I92I Nevertheless merchandise shipments undoubtedly increased somewhat at the same time that manufacturing output suf fered a drastic decline This fact indicates that current production was less than shipments and consequently that manufacturers stocks have been reduced Monthly figures since the beginning of I919 are available for cars loaded with merchandise 1 c 1 and miscellaneous  freight These figures as well as those for total car loadings duly ad justed for seasonal influences fluctuated less violently than the volume of goods manu factured Chart 4 gives a comparison of the adjusted figures for merchandise 1 c 1 and miscellaneous shipments and the output of manufactures Shipments rose to a maximum figure of II4 in January I920 and fell to a mini mum of 93 in January I92I while the output of manufactures as we have said fell from iI8 in I920 to 72 in I92I The relation between the most recent figures is striking In February I922 the output of manufactures as we have said rose to 95 compared with I05 for merchandise 1 c 1 and miscellaneous shipments In March shipments advanced to I09 the highest figure CHART 2  ADJUSTED INDICES FOR THE VOLUME OF GOODS MANUFACTURED AND THE NUMBERS OF WORKERS EMPLOYED

which indicates that an enlarged current output is necessary to meet a growing volume of ship ments From this comparison of the output of manu factured goods with the shipments of manu factured goods it appears that manufacturing output declined much more in I92I than did shipments and consequently that stocks of goodsfor which only incomplete and inad equate statistics are available  must have been drawn upon for the sales of I92I The few direct figures which are available for stocks on hand in January I922 compared with January I92I confirm this conclusion Among 22 manufac tured articles and important materials used in manufacture the stocks of I7 declined during the year 4 advanced and i remained constant For certain scattering commodities  structural steel enamel baths lavatories and sinks oak flooring paper data are available for com paring the physical volume sold with that of a year ago In every one of these cases there has been an increase in the physical volume of sales This is a situation which explains the rise in the volume of manufacture registered in the second half of I92I and the first quarter of I922 In the first quarter of I922 the relative number of cars loaded with all classes of freight has shown a remarkable expansion from 702 in January to 765 in February and 825 in March This sharp increase in car loadings in recent months only partly due to a heavier movement of coal in anticipation of the strike is striking evidence that an increase in general industrial activity is necessary to supply current demand Railroad car loadings constitute only indirect evidence of the sale and consumption of goods The figures for loadings measure the distribution of raw materials to manufacturers and of finished goods to wholesalers and retailers they do not show that goods have passed into the hands of the ultimate consumers A more direct measure of the consumption of goods would be given by an index of the physical volume of retail trade but data for such an index do not exist The best substitute for such an index are the figures for the total values of goods sold by certain de partment stores mailorder houses and chain stores Relative figures for retail sales of various classes of stores for I920 and I92I are given in the accompanying table From this table it will be seen that in general the value of sales fell in I92I compared with I920 but that the de cline was less than I6 per cent for every class except mailorder houses When we recall the fact that retail prices probably fell considerably RELATivE RETAIL SALES OF VARIOUS CLASSES

that of I920 and perhaps even greater Although it is hardly probable that these figures are representative of retail trade in general nevertheless they support the con clusion that the decline in the quantity of goods sold at retail in I92I was very much less than the decline in the quantity of goods manufactured For the first quarter of I922 similar figures are not available but the relative sales of cer tain stores in January and February compared with the corresponding months of I920 and I92I are as follows 1920 192I 1922 Sears RoebuckCo IOO 5I 46 Montgomery Ward  Co  ioo 55 56 4 five

remained un changed see Survey of Current Business March I922 p 8REVIEW OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR 57 cline is wholly or in large part the result of the fall in prices The evidence presented above indicates that the fluctuations in the output of manufactured goods during the years I9I2I was very much more violent than the fluctuations in consump tion In the last year and a half shipments and consumption have materially exceeded produc tion Consequently stocks have been reduced and in recent months there has been an increas ing resort to current manufacture to supply current consumption In general it may be said that a violent decline of manufacturing output coupled with relatively stable consump tion of goods results in a situation which forces a revival of manufacturing activity and it is precisely this situation in which we find our selves in the first quarter of I9221 As is usual in a period of depression and fall ing prices buying of goods during the past year has been for immediate sale or consumption only In consequence of this policy which has apparently been pursued by manufacturers wholesalers and retailers alike unfilled orders are small and stocks of goods are probably mod erate When buying is of the handtomouth variety however and deliveries are prompt stocks appear to be much larger than they really are Prices therefore are slow to recover it is usually not until a fair volume of output has been attained and producers refuse to take busi ness at concessions in price that the majority of purchasers change their buying policies There is evidence that March witnessed a transition from a buyers market in some important com modities notably iron and steel to one of stiffening prices COMMODITY PRICES The fluctuations of wholesale prices of differ ent dasses of commodities vary widely from each other over periods of business prosperity and depression In general materials used by pro ducers suffer greater price declines during periods of depressed business than do consumers goods Thus the index of producers goods compiled by the Federal Reserve Board fell from I34 rela tive to the average for I9I9 as ioo in May I920 to 63 in January I922 while the index for con sumers goods fell from I27 to 67 in the same period see Chart 5 The greater violence in the decline in prices of producers goods after a crisis is a finding in accord with the facts concerning the production and consumption of manufactured goods set forth in the previous section ie after a crisis production falls much more violently than consumption The relative violence of the decline in prices of certain types of goods compared with other types is not fully brought out by Chart 5 The REVIEWS index based upon ten peculiarly sen sitive price series

quarter of I922 the REVIEWS index is still considerably below that for all commodities although an upward trend in the prices of the ten commodi ties has been registered since last August In case a substantial revival of manufacturing activity occurs  as appears probable from the relations existing between the production and shipment of manufactured goods  a marked rise of the average prices of the ten commodi ties and other commodities like them is to be expected A comparison of the movements of the whole sale prices of food retail prices of food and the cost of living is shown in Chart 7 Wholesale food prices declined most violently of the three series between I920 and the first quarter of I922 retail food prices next and cost of living least Retail food prices and prices of the other elements entering into the cost of living such as rent cl6thing fuel and sundries rose less violently than wholesale prices in I9I920 and fell less violently in I9202I Retail food prices and cost of living are now in the first quarter of I922 relatively higher than wholesale prices In February and March wholesale food prices showed an upward trend which brings them more nearly in line with other commodities and helps to rectify existing maladjustments The stocks of leading cereals on March I as esti mated by the Federal Bureau of Crop Estimates were moderate as shown by the following figures

increasing activity in man ufacturing industries  is favorable to a con tinuation of the upward movement in wholesale food prices A rise in the prices of various important pro ducers goods including farm products would be the natural consequence of an increase of manufacturing activity An increase of manu facturing activity in I922 is warranted by the present relatively low volume of production compared with the indicated consumption of goods Increased physical output and higher prices however require a plentiful supply of bank credit Therefore an examination of the credit situation is pertinent MONEY AND CREDIT The most obvious development of I92I was the change in the banking situation from one of strain to one of ease The rapid accumulation CHART 6WHOLESALE PRICE INDICES FOR ALL

first month of I922 These movements are shown in Chart 8 There is evidence in the more recent figures for earning assets and federal re serve notes in circulation that contraction has come to an end although there is no pronounced indication of expansion The first indication of the beginnings of expansion however would be revealed by the statements of member banks rather than those of the federal reserve banks Total loans and investments less rediscounts with federal reserve banks of member banks re porting to the Federal Reserve Board declined steadily from the spring of I920 until September I92I Since September however this item has increased for New York banks and other banks The figures for September 7 I92I and March 29 I922 are given in the accompanying table In spectioni of these figures shows that the increase in total loans and investments less rediscounts is the result of two factors First investments increased both for New York banks and all other banks Second bills rediscounted with the federal reserve banks which have been sub tracted from total loans and investments to secure a net figure declined greatly for both groups of banks On account of these two fac tors ie heavier investments by member banks and liquidation of rediscounts net loans and investments of all banks have increased in the past eight months It will be noticed that loans and discounts including rediscounts made pri marily for business purposes  all other loans and discounts  were less on March 29 I922 than on September 7 I92I During the past two months however loans for business purposes have not declined the figures at the end of March CHART 8 SELECTED ITEMS FROM THEE STATE1MENTS OF THE COMBINED FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS Millionsof dollrs 300  P500 Re5erve8 2 i I cedi3counted by

ended and expan sion is in prospect This conclusion is supported by recent fluctuations in the volume of commer cial paper outstanding as reported by 30 dealers to the New York Federal Reserve Bank The volume of paper declined steadily from the first quarter of I920 to the last quarter of I92I but since the middle of 192I the decline has been nominal and in the first two months of I922 the volume has materially increased As we have said in view of these facts and the additional fact that net demand deposits have increased since last August it appears that contraction of credit for business purposes has come to an end and that expansion is beginning The improvement of the credit situation in the last seven months of I92I and the first quarter of I922 is shown in Chart 9 In January money rates hardened somewhat but a downward trend again became evident in February and March At the end of March the rate on com mercial paper was 4244 per cent There ap pears to be no reason at the present time from the evidence furnished by bank statements to anticipate that dear money will be an obstacle to business recovery in I922 Both bank statements and money rates indi cate that credit is readily obtainable The ab sorption by investors of new securities issued on more favorable terms to borrowers than form erly is another indication of the availability of credit and capital for business expansion The total volume of security issues as reported by the Commercial and Financial Chronicle for January and February I922 was 807 million dollars compared with 735 millions and 77I millions respectively for the corresponding months of I92I and I920 The figure for I922 includes 94 millions of federal farm loan bonds of which there were no issues in the preceding years The volume of issues of comparable securities corporate industrial and railroad foreign government and municipal  was therefore somewhat less in the first two months of 1922 than in corresponding months of I92I and I920 Nevertheless the issues in I922 are of sufficient volume to show that capital sup plies are available for current requirements at decreasing rates of interest The course of prices of three classes of securi ties  twenty common industrial stocks pre ferred stocks of the same companies and ten highclass railroad bonds  is shown in Chart io The substantial rise of all three classes in the second half of 192i and the continuation of the upward movement in the first quarter of I922 is a significant development Probably the re covery of security prices in I92I registered first by highgrade bonds  was in large part merely the reflection of declining money rates CHART 9  MONEY RATES BoND YIELD AND NEW YORK REDISCOUNT RATE Per cent I     60 H0Sl  pCmmrer rte Bondyield M4nimum

Preferre  7C0 1 AmmIon 6C  50REVIEW OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE YEAR 6i The persistent strength of security prices in recent months however undoubtedly reflects the belief that better business is ahead A con tinued upward movement in security prices in times past has always been followed by a revival of business and the present strength of security prices is confirmatory evidence that funda mental conditions are on the mend SUMMARY i The most striking feature of the industrial situation in the last seven months of I92I and the first three months of I922 is the relatively moderate volume of manufacture compared with the shipment sale and indicated consumption of manufactured goods 2 This relationship between production and consumption of manufactures means that strong forces are operating to produce increased in dustrial activity The physical volume of manu factures in fact increased steadily in the second half of I92I and the first quarter of I922 3 Car loading  merchandise and total load ings for all classes of commodities held up well in I92I and increased substantially in the first quarter of I922 indicating that greater manufacturing activity is probable 4 The prices of important raw materials and basic articles are relatively lower than the prices of finished goods Agricultural prices were strong during the last three months but the prices of most other materials showed no persistent up ward trend A substantial rise in the prices of other than agricultural materials will probably accompany increased industrial activity 5 Credit is available for financing a larger volume of production than now exists at a higher price level Statistics of bank loans and com mercial paper outstanding show that contraction of loans for business purposes has ended and that banking expansion is in prospect 6 Persistent strength of industrial and rail road stock prices especially in the last two months forecasts business improvement The first quarter of I922 made measurable progress toward business recovery The rela tionship between production distribution and consumption of goods the recovery of agricul tural prices recent advances of other wholesale prices the availability of credit at moderate rates and the strength of security prices indicate that continued improvement is in prospect

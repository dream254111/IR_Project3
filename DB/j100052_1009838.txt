J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1009838,THE FINANCIAL REPORTS OF NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL,I242562,THE FINANCIAL REPORTS OF NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL BY F A CLEVELAND PHD NEW YORK UNIVERSITY THE INQUIRY SUGGESTED BY THE TITLE WOULD SEEM TO BE ONE OF POS SIBILITY RATHER THAN PRECEDENT OR PRESENT PRACTICE ASSUMING THIS POINT OF VIEW DISCUSSION WILL FIRST PROCEED FROM A CONSIDERATION OF THE LAW UNDER WHICH POWERS OF CONTROL MAY BE EXERCISED BROADLY SPEAKING THERE ARE THREE LEGAL QUESTIONS RAISED I WHAT ARE THE POWERS OF CONTROL GIVEN BY THE NATIONAL BANK ACT 2 UNDER THE ACT WHAT ARE THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH CONTROL IS TO BE EXERCISED AND 3 IN THE EXERCISE OF POWERS GRANTED BY THE ACT WHAT DEVICES OR MEANS MAV BE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPTROLLER TO REACH THESE ENDS THE POWERS OF CONTROL GIVEN BY THE NATIONAL BANK ACT THE FIRST OF THESE QUESTIONS MAY BE ANSWERED BY DIRECT APPEAL TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE ACT SECTION 87 OF THE NATIONAL BANKING LAW SECTION 52I R S CONTAINS THIS SPECIFIC MANDATORY DECLARA TION EVERV ASSOCIATION I E NATIONAL BANK SHALL MAKE TO THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY NOT LESS THAN FIVE REPORTS DURING THE YEAR ACCORDING TO THE FORM WHICH MAY BE PRESCRIBED BY HIM THIS GENERAL PROVISION IS SUPPLEMENTED BY GRANTS OF SPECIFIC POWER TO THE COMPTROLLER WHICH ETLABLE HIM TO CALL FOR OTHER REPORTS AS OFTEN AS HE MAY DESIRE AND TO OBTAIN SUCH INFORMATION AS HE IN HIS OWN JUDGMENT THINKS NECESSARY TO A FULL AND COMPLETE KNOWLEDGE OF FINANCIAL CONDITION A BANK FAILING OR REFUSING TO COMPLY WITH SUCH REQUEST IS LIABLE TO A PENALTY OF IOO PER DAY SEC 5213 R S IT WOULD APPEAR THEREFORE THAT THE COMPTROLLER IS NOT LACKING IN AUTHORITY TO OBTAIN ANY AND ALL INFORMATION WHICH MAY BE NECESSARY TO ADMINISTRATIVE SUPERVISION A FURTHER READING OF THE NATIONAL BANK ACT QUITE AS CONCISELY FORCES THE CONCLUSION THAT THE COMP TROLLER HAS ALL THE POWER NECESSARY TO A COMPLETE CONTROL OVER NATIONAL BANKS AND THEIR OPERATIONS AS TO ALL SUBJECTS WHICH ARE PROPERLY 45THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WITHIN THE RANGE OF OFFICIAL DISCRETION THIS POWER EXTENDS EVEN TO THE TAKING POSSESSION OF THE BANK ITSELF AND WINDING UP ITS AFFAIRS FOR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH HIS DEMANDS THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH CONTROL IS TO BE EXERCISED THIS BRINGS US TO CONSIDER THE SECOND QUESTION RAISED VIZ THE SUBJECTS OF OFFICIAL DISCRETION OR THE PURPOSES FOR WHICH OFFICIAL CONTROL IS TO BE EXERCISED UNDER THE ACT IT HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY AFFIRMED THAT THE PRIME PURPOSE OF THE NATIONAL BANK ACT WAS TO CREATE A BETTER MARKET FOR GOVERNMENT BONDS AT A TIME WHEN THE NATIONAL CREDIT NEEDED SUPPORT IN THE MIDST OF CIVIL STRIFE WHEN THE FINANCIAL RESOURCES OF THE NATION WERE STRAINED ALMOST TO THE POINT OF BANK RUPTCY IT WAS CONCEIVED THAT A VERY LARGE PART OF THE CAPITAL EMPLOYED IN CONMMERCIAL BANKING ENTERPRISE IN THE UNITED STATES MIGHT BE UTILIZED TO SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT THE PLAN PROPOSED WAS AN OLD ONEONE IN WHICH THE BANKS BEING INDUCED TO USE THEIR CAPITAL TO PURCHASE GOVERNMENT BONDS WOULD BE PERMITTED TO USE BANK NOTES WITH WHICH TO CARRY ON THEIR BUSINESS BY THIS DEVICE IT WAS THOUGHT THAT THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF THE BANKS MIGHT BE BROUGHT TO THE SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNMENTI E THAT THE STATE BANKS MIGHT BE INDUCED TO BRING OVER THEIR CAPITAL INTO A NEW NATIONAL SYSTEM WHERE IT MLIGHT BE UTILIZED IN THE MANNER INDICATED TO MAKE SUCH A SCHEME ACCEPTABLE HOWEVER TWO CONDITIONS MUST BE MET THE FIRST RESULT OF SUCH A PLAN OF SUPPORT TO THE BOND MARKET WOULD BE A LARGE INCREASE IN THE MONEY CIRCULATION OF THE COUNTRY THE BANKNOTE WOULD NOT BE RECEIVED UNLESS IT WERE MADE AS SOUND I E AS VALUABLE AS THE MONEY THEN IN CURRENT USETHE GREEN BACK BUT THIS WAS NOT THE ONLY CONDITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT MUST RECKON WITH IN THE EXPERIENCE OF THE PAST BUSINESS HAD SUFFERED QUITE AS MUCH FROM UNSOUND BANK CREDIT IN THE FORM OF CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTS OR DEPOSITS AS IT HAD FROM AN UNSOUND CURRENCY NATIONAL REACTION AGAINST WILDCAT BANKING HAD BUT RECENTLY FORCED THE SEVERAL STATE SYSTEMS OVER TO A BASIS OF CAPITALIZATION AND OFFICIAL INSPECTION TO PROTECT THE PEOPLE AGAINST WHOLESALE FRAUD AND BANK RUPTCY IF THESE STATE INSTITUTIONS WERE TO BE BROUGHT INTO A NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEMIF THE GOVERNMENT WAS TO UTILIZE THEIR CAPITAL RESOURCES TO FUND ITS OWN NECESSITIESTHE NEW NATIONAL SYSTEM 46NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL MUST CARRY WITH IT ALL THE PROVISIONS FOR SAFETY AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE SPECULATIVE DEVICES OF THE UNSCRUPULOUS THAT THREE DECADES OF LEGISLATIVE REACTION HAD EVOLVED WILDCAT BANKING WAS BANKING ON COMMERCIAL ASSETS WITHOUT ADEQUATE CAPITALIZATION FROM I837 TO THE TIME OF THE CIVIL WAR THE WHOLE TREND IN BANKING IDEALS AND IN BANKING LEGISLATION WAS TOWARD THE STRENGTHENING OF BANKING EQUIPMENT IT HAD BEEN FOUND FROM BITTER EXPERIENCE THAT A BANK WHICH WAS NOT PROPERLY CAPITALIZED AND WHICH THEREFORE DID NOT HAVE CAPITAL RESOURCES SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT ITS CREDIT TRANSACTIONS WAS AS DANGEROUS TO THOSE COMING INTO BUSINESS CONTACT WITH IT AS WAS A MINE OR A FACTORY WHOSE CONSTRUCTION WAS FAULTY AND WHOSE MACHINERY WAS OVER CROWDED TO THE PUBLIC THE POORLYEQUIPPED BANK WAS MUCH MORE DANGEROUS THAN THE MINE OR THE FACTORY BY REASON OF THE FACT THAT IN CASE OF COLLAPSE A MUCH LARGER NUMBER OF PEOPLE WERE CONSTANTLY WITHIN THE DANGER LINE AFTER TWO YEARS OF AGITATION AND AMENDMENT AND COMPROMISE AN ACCEPTABLE LAW WAS ENACTED THIS ACT CARRIED WITH IT TWO PRO TECTIVE FEATURES I THE NOTE WAS TO BE SECURED BY A COLLATERAL DEPOSIT OF BONDS PURCHASED AND 2 THOSE HOLDING THE CREDIT ACCOUNTS OF THE BANK WERE TO BE PROTECTED BY PROVISIONS WHICH REQUIRED WHAT WAS THOUGHT TO BE ADEQUATE CAPITALIZATION BEFORE BUSINESS MIGHT BE BEGUN AND BY THE EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL SUPERVISION TO PREVENT IMPAIR MENT OF CAPITAL DURING THE PERIOD THAT BUSINESS SHOULD CONTINUE IT WAS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENFORCING THESE TWO PROVISIONS OF SAFETY AND SECURITY THAT THE BUREAU OF THE CURRENCY WAS CREATED AND A COMPTROLLER WAS APPOINTED MEANS BY WHICH CONTROL MAY BE EXERCISED AND THE ENDS OF THE ACT REACHED THE FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPTROLLER HAVE A DIRECT RELATION TO THE CONDITIONS ABOVE DESCRIBED THE FIRST OR AS IT WAS THEN VIEWED THE PRIME PURPOSE FOR WHICH PUBLIC CONTROL WAS TO BE EXERCISED WAS TO GUARANTEE THE SOUNDNESS OF THE NEW NATIONAL CURRENCY THIS IS CLEARLY EXPRESSED IN THE FIRST CLAUSE OF THE BANK ACT WHICH RECITES THERE SHALL BE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY A BUREAU CHARGED WITH THE EXECUTION OF ALL THE LAWS PASSED BY CONGRESS RELATING TO THE 47THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ISSUE AND REGULATION OF A NATIONAL CURRENCY SECURED BY UNITED STATES BONDS THE CHIEF OFFICER OF WHICH BUREAU SHALL BE CALLED THE COMP TROLLER OF THE CURRENCY     THE SECOND PURPOSE OF THE APPOINT MENT OF A COMPTROLLER IS SET OUT IN VARIOUS SUBSEQUENT PORTIONS OF THE BANK ACT DESIGNED TO INSURE ADEQUATE CAPITALIZATION THESE LATER PROVISIONS OF TWO CLASSES VIZ I THOSE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ADE QUATE CAPTALIZATION AS A CONDITION PRECEDENT TO COMMENCING BUSI NESS AND 2 THOSE INTENDED AT ALL TIMES TO SECURE CUSTOMERS AGAINST LOSS ON ACCOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL THAT THE NATIONAL CURRENCY WHICH WAS TO BE ISSUED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE BANKS MIGHT BE KEPT AS SOUND AS THE STANDARD MONEY I E THAT ALL FORMS OF MONEY ISSUES MIGHT HAVE A COMMON VALUATION PROVISION WAS MADE THAT THE BONDS PURCHASED BY THE BANKS MIGHT BE HYPOTHECATED WITH THE TREASURER AS COLLATERAL SECURITY FOR FINAL PAYMENT AND REDEMPTION OF NOTES OUTSTANDING ACCORDING TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT THE GOVERNMENT WAS MADE A TRUSTEE FOR THE BENEFIT OF NOTEHOLDERS FOR EACH 9OO OF NOTES TURNED OVER TO THE BANK BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR ISSUE THE TREASURER WAS TO HOLD A NONINTEREST BEARING ACCOUNT WITH THE BANK SECURED BY A IOOO BOND THE OBLIGATION OF THE BANK TO THE GOVERNMENT WAS FOR THE REPAYMENT OF 900 IN BANK NOTES OR LEGAL TENDER MONEY AT ITS OWN OPTION THE GOVERNMENT AS TRUSTEE WAS THE LEGAL OWNER OF THE BOND THE BENEFICIARIES WERE I THE NOTEHOLDERS TO THE AMOUNT OF NOTES HELD AND 2 THE BANK FOR THE AMOUNT OF THE CURRENT INCOME ON THE BOND AND FOR ITS EQUITY OF REDEMPTION THIS MADE THE BANK THE IMMEDIATE AGENCY OF REDEMPTION OF THE NEW CURRENCY AND THE TREASURER AS TRUSTEE THE AGENT OF ULTIMATE REDEMPTION SUCH A PLAN OF NATIONAL CURRENCY HAVING BEEN ADOPTED WHEN A BANK ISSUED A NOTE THE CUSTOMER TOOK IT NOT ON THE CREDIT OF THE BANK BUT AS A BENEFICIARY IN THE TRUST SECURITY HELD BY THE GOVERNMENT THE NOTE HOLDER NEVER INQUIRED AS TO THE CREDIT OF THE BANK THROUGH WHICH THE NOTE WAS ISSUED BUT RELIED ENTIRELY ON HIS CLAIM AGAINST THE SECURITY HELD IN TRUST BY THE TREASURER SINCE BOTH BONDS AND GREENBACKS WERE GOVERNMENT CREDIT THE NATIONAL CURRENCY SECURED BY GOVERNMENT BONDS WAS TAKEN BY THE PUBLIC TO BE AS GOOD AS A GREENBACK LATER WHEN BOTH GREENBACKS AND BONDS WERE REDEEMED IN GOLD THIS NATIONAL CURRENCY CAME TO BE CONSIDERED AS GOOD AS GOLD AS A MEANS OF CONTROL TO SECURE THE SOUNDNESS OF THE CIRCULA 48NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL TION OR NATIONAL CURRENCY SO ISSUED THEREFORE THE FUNCTION OF THE NEWLY CREATED BUREAU WAS TO SEE THAT THE TRUST ACCOUNT OF THE BANK WITH THE TREASURER WAS KEPT AMPLY SECURED AND THAT THE BONDS HELD AS COLLATERAL SECURITY WERE SUFFICIENT FOR THIS PURPOSE BUT ALL THE DATA WERE AT HAND FOR DETERMINING THIS FACT AND THE BONDS THEM SELVES BEING IN CUSTODY THE SERVICES OF THE COMPTROLLER IN HIS CAPACITY AS GUARDIAN OF THE CURRENCY BECAME MERELY NOMINAL AND PERFUNCTORY MOREOVER FOR THIS SERVICE NO REPORT WAS NECESSARY THE CHIEF FUNCTIONS OF THE COMPTROLLER NOT SO HOWEVER WTH THE SECOND FUNCTION OF CONTROL EXERCISED BY THE BUREAUTHE PROTECTION OF THOSE WHO HOLD OPEN ACCOUNTS OR DEPOSITS OF THE BANK THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS CHARACTER OF OFFICIAL GUARDIANSHIP HAS CORRESPONDINGLY INCREASEDBUT NOT IN ITS BEARING ON ORIGINAL CAPITALIZATION AS AT THE BEGINNING THE METHOD OF ASCERTAINING WHETHER THE BANK HAD THE REQUISITE CAPITAL RESOURCES TO COMMENCE BANKING OPERATIONS HAS REMAINED ONE OF INSPECTION AND NOT ONE OF FINANCIAL REPORT THE COMPTROLLER MUST KNOW THAT AT LEAST 50 PER CENT OF THE AMOUNT OF THE AUTHORIZED CAPITAL STOCK IS ACTUALLY IN HAND IN MONEY AND THAT THE BALANCE OF THE STOCK SUBSCRIP TION IS GOOD SO THAT IT MAY BE REALIZED IN IO PER CENT MONTHLY INSTALL MENTS THE MOST DIFFICULT DUTY WHICH THE COMPTROLLER HAS TO PERFORM AND THE ONE OF INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO THE FINANCIAL WORLD IS THAT WHICH PERTAINS TO THE SECURITY OF THE PUBLIC AGAINST THE IMPAIRMENT OF APITAL RESOURCES DURING THE PERIOD THAT THE BANK CONTINUES IN OPERATION KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE FEATURE OF THE WORK MUST COME LARGELY FROM THE REPORTS MADE BY THE BANKS THEMSELVES AS THE NUMBER OF EXAMINERS IS GROSSLY INADEQUATE TO REPORT MORE THAN A CHECK ON SOME OF THE MAIN ITEMS OF ACCOUNT IT IS FROM THIS DUTY THAT THE SUBJECT ASSIGNED TAKES ITS CHIEF BEARING PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC AGAINST IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL RESOURCES TO STATE MORE SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE COLNP TROLLER MUST HAVE IN MIND IN ASKING FOR REPORTS WITH RESPECT TO CAPITAL IZATION SECTION NO 5202 R S PROVIDES THAT NO ASSOCIATION AT ANY 49THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TIME SHALL BE INDEBTED OR IN ANY WAY LIABLE TO AN AMOUNT EXCEEDING THE AMOUNT OF ITS CAPITAL STOCK CAPITAL RESOURCES AT SUCH TIME ACTU ALLY PAID IN AND REMAINING UNDIMINISHED BY LOSS OR OTHERWISE EXCEPT ON ACCOUNTS OF THE NATURE FOLLOWING I NOTES OF CIRCULATION 2 MONEYS DEPOSITED WITH OR COLLECTED BY THE ASSOCIATION 3 BILLS OF EXCHANGE OR DRAFTS DRAWN AGAINST MONEY ACTUALLY ON DEPOSIT TO THE CREDIT OF THE ASSOCIATION OR DUE THERETO 4 LIABILITIES TO THE STOCK HOLDERS OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR DIVIDENDS AND RESERVE PROFITS SEC TION 5203 R S SPECIFIES THAT NO ASSOCIATION SHALL EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY PLEDGE OR HYPOTHECATE ANY OF ITS NOTES OF CIRCULATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROCURING MONEY TO BE PAID IN ON ITS CAPITAL STOCK OR TO BE USED IN ITS BANKING OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE NOR SHALL ANY ASSOCIATION USE ITS CIRCULATION NOTES OR ANY PART THEREOF IN ANY MANNER OR FORM TO CREATE OR INCREASE ITS CAPITAL STOCK CAPITAL RE SOURCES SECTION NO 5204 RECITES THAT NO ASSOCIATION OR ANY MEMBER THEREOF SHALL DURING THE PERIOD IT SHALL CONTINUE ITS BANKING OPERATION WITHDRAW OR PERMIT TO BE WITHDRAWN EITHER IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE ANY PORTION OF ITS CAPITAL CAPITAL RE SOURCES AGAIN IN SECTION NO 5205 R S THE LAW REQUIRES THAT EVERY ASSOCIATION WHICH SHALL HAVE FAILED TO PAY UP ITS CAPITAL STOCK AS REQUIRED BY LAW AND EVERY ASSOCIATION WHOSE CAPITAL STOCK CAPITAL RESOURCES SHALL HAVE BECOME IMPAIRED BY LOSS OR OTHERWISE SHALL WITHIN THREE MONTHS AFTER RECEIVING NOTICE THEREOF FROM THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY PAY THE DEFICIENCY IN CAPITAL STOCK CAPITAL RESOURCES BY ASSESSMENT UPON THE STOCKHOLDERS PRO RATA FOR THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL STOCK CAPITAL LIABILITY HELD BY EACH ALL OF THESE AND OTHER ASSIGNMENTS OF DUTY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROTECTION OF CUSTOMERS AGAINST IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL MAKE NECES SARY AN OFFICIAL INQUIRY INTO THE RELATION OF CAPITAL RESOURCES TO CAPITAL LIABILITIES THEY REQUIRE A SPECIFIC INQUIRY AS TO THE CAPITAL RESOURCES AT HAND FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE CAPITAL EQUIPMENT OF THE BANK HAS BECOME IMPAIRED THROUGH LOSS ON ACCOUNT OF BANKING OPERATIONS OR OTHERWISE A KEENLY ANALYTICAL REPORT IS NECESSARY TO PROPERLY EXECUTE THIS FUNCTION OF CONTROL IT IS NECESSARY TO DISTINGUISH THE CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIABILITIES FROM THE OTHER ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS OF BUSINESS 50NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REPORT TO THE COMPTROLLER AS A MEANS OF CONTROL IN TAKING UP THE FORM OF REPORT MADE BY THE BANKS TO THE COMPTROLLER ATTENTION WILL BE CONFINED TO THE INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WELL DESIGNED TO GIVE THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO THE EXERCISE OF SOUND OFFICIAL DISCRETION IS THE FORM OF REPORT SUCH AS TO ENABLE ONE TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE CAPITAL RESOURCES HAVE BECOME IMPAIRED AN EXAMINATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS AT PRESENT MADE WILL DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT NO ATTEMPT IS MADE TO DISTINGUISH CAPITAL RESOURCES AND LIABILITIES FROM THE ASSETS AND OBLIGATIONS CURRENT TO THE BUSINESS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF A GOING CONCERN IT HAS BECOME AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE OF ANALYSIS THAT CAPITAL RESOURCES ARE ALL THOSE PROPERTIES AND ASSETS WHICH ARE IN TENDED FOR PERMANENT OR CONTINUOUS USE IN THE BUSINESS TWO PRINCIPLES OF ADMINISTRATION ARE WELL SETTLED I TO PROSECUTE AN ENTERPRISE SUCCESSFULLY IT IS NECESSARY TO PROVIDE THE MANAGEMENT WITH EQUIPMENT ADAPTED TO ITS PURPOSES AND 2 WHATEVER PROPERTY EQUIPMENT AND STOCK IS PERMANENTLY OR CONSTANTLY NEEDED SHOULD BE PROVIDED OUT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT THIS IS THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH CAPITAL IS NEEDED PROPER EQUIPMENT IS NECESSARY TO SUCCESS AS A MATTER BOTH OF FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE AND OF FINANCIAL SAFETY THIS EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE PROVIDED OUT OF CAPITAL TO ATTEMPT TO PRO VIDE PERMANENT EQUIPMENT OUT OF TEMPORARY LOANS OR FLOATING DEBT IS TO HOLD THE ENTERPRISE IN CONSTANT JEOPARDY THIS IS AS TRUE OF A BANK AS IT IS OF A RAILROAD OR OF A MINE AND THIS IS THE UNDERLYING THOUGHT OF THE LAW THE CURRENT ASSETS OF AN ENTERPRISE ARE THOSE WHICH ARE ACQUIRED NOT FOR EQUIPMENT USE IN THE BUSINESS BUT THOSE WHICH ARE ACQUIRED IN ITS CURRENT TRANSACTIONSI E IN THE COURSE OF CURRENT OPERATION FOR PROFIT IT IS TO FUND THE CURRENT NEEDSTO MEET THE CURRENT EX PENSESTO PROVIDE FUNDS TO CARRY THESE CURRENT ASSETS AND TRANS ACTIONSTHAT CURRENT LIABILITIES OR FLOATING DEBT IS INCURRED IF THE PRINCIPLES OF FINANCIAL ANALYSIS COMMONLY EMPLOYED IN ACCOUNTING ARE APPLIED TO THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF NATIONAL BANKS CONCLUSIONS MAY BE REACHED AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE CAPITAL RESOURCES HAVE BEEN IMPAIRED AS WELL AS WHETHER OR NOT THE PERMANENT EQUIPMENT IS 5ITHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT ITS OPERATIONS WITH SAFETY TO THOSE WHO MAY BE IN BUSINESS CONTACT WITH THE INSTITUTIONS UNDER EXAMINATION WHAT ARE THE CAPITAL RESOURCES OF NATIONAL BANKS THE REPORTS AS AT PRESENT MADE TO THE COMPTROLLER ARE NOT BASED ON SUCH A SYSTEM OF ANALYSIS AND THEREFORE ANY ATTEMPT AT REARRANGEMENT TO THIS END MUST BE IN A MEASURE UNRELIABLE BUT TAKING THE VARIOUS ITEMS OF RESOURCE EXHIBITED AS A BASIS FOR PRESENT DISCUSSION A FAIR APPROXIMATION MAY BE REACHED I BANKING HOUSES AND FIXTURES ARE UNQUESTIONABLY CAPITAL RESOURCES 2 REAL ESTATE IN CONTEMPLATION OF LAW AND FROM EVERY POINT OF BUSINESS REASONING SHOULD BE CHARGED AGAINST CAPITAL 3 THE BANK INVESTS ITS CAPITAL IN BONDS TO SECURE CIRCULATION AND RECEIVES ON THE COLLATERALS DEPOSITED NOTES WHICH MAY BE USED IN THE BUSINESS THE MARGIN OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN THESE COLLATERALS SHOULD BE CON SIDERED A CAPITAL CHARGE THE SAME IS TRUE OF THE MARGINS INVESTED IN THE COLLATERALS DEPOSITED TO SECURE GOVERNMENT DEPOSITS 4 THE MONEY RESERVE IS ESSENTIALLY A CAPITAL RESERVE IT IS THE PRIN CIPAL EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO SUPPORT THE CURRENT CREDIT ACCOUNTS DEPOSITS OUTSTANDINGTHE FLOATING DEBT OF THE BUSINESS THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE CASH HELD BY A BANK SHOULD BE A DIRECT CHARGE AGAINST CAPITALIZATION AND IS MADE SO BY LEGAL ENACTMENT THE ONLY QUESTION WITH REFERENCE TO THIS CLASS OF ITEMS PERTAINS TO THE INTERPRETATION TO BE GIVEN AS TO WHAT PROPERLY CONSTITUTES MONEY RESERVES 5 THE ACCOUNTS WHICH IT IS NECESSARY FOR A BANK TO MAINTAIN TO PROVIDE FOR AN EXCHANGE ARE LIKEWISE AN ASSET PERMANENTLY NEEDED AND IN CONTINUOUS USE THEY SHOULD THEREFORE BE COUNTED AS A PART OF THE NECESSARY BANKING EQUIPMENT 6 FINALLY THE UNENCUMBERED SECURITIES AND OTHER DIRECT INVEST MENTS OF CAPITAL OWNED AND HELD BY A BANK AS A MEANS OF STRENGTHEN ING ITS MONEY RESERVE SHOULD BE REGARDED AS CAPITAL RESOURCE THESE MUST BE SO CONSIDERED FOR THE REASON THAT THE DIRECT APPLICATION OF CAPITAL TO THE PURCHASE OF SECURITIES OR FOR THAT MATTER EVEN THE PURCHASE OF COMMERCIAL PAPER IS NOT BANKING THERE CAN BE ONE PURPOSE ONLY FOR MAKING SUCH PURCHASES VIZ TO KEEP THE CAPITAL WHICH IS NEEDED TO SUPPORT CREDIT TRANSACTIONS INVESTED IN INCOME PRODUCING ASSETS WHEN NOT NEEDED IN THE FORM OF CASH SECURI 52NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL TIES MUST BE CONSIDERED EITHER AS BANKING EQUIPMENT OR AS AN INVESTMENT WHICH IS A CHARGE ON CAPITALIZATION THE SAME IS TRUE OF ALL OTHER DIRECT INVESTMENTS OF CAPITAL A BANK WHICH ENGAGES IN BUY ING AND SELLING SECURITIES IN UNDERWRITING FLOTATION OR IN OTHER BUSINESS NOT IN THE NATURE OF BANKING NEEDS TO HAVE A LARGER CAPITAL THAN AN INSTITUTION WHICH DOES NOT SO ENGAGE ITSELF WHETHER THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT BE IN BANKING EQUIPMENT OR IN OTHER ASSETS AND BUSINESS VENTURES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS THUS ENGAGED BY THE BANKS SHOULD BE SET UP AS CAPITAL RESOURCES OR CHARGES AGAINST THE CAPITAL PROVIDED FOR DOING BUSINESS THE PROTECTION OF WHICH IS THE CHIEF END OF CONTROL THESE SEVERAL CLASSES OF ASSETS BEING IN THE NATURE OF CAPITAL RESOURCES THE RELATIONS PERTAINING TO WHICH THE DUTY OF THE COMP TROLLER OBTAINS ARE TO BE FOUND I IN A COMPARISON OF THE CAPITAL RESOURCES ON HAND WITH THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL PROVIDED FOR USE OF THE INSTITUTION UNDER EXAMINATION AND 2 IN AN EXANLINATION OF CURRENT ASSETS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THERE HAVE BEEN ANY LOSSES SUF FERED IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE BUSINESS SINCE ALL BAD LOANS ETC MUST BE CHARGED AGAINST CAPITAL THE ACCOUNTS EXHIBITING CAPITAL PUT INTO BUSINESS ARE FOUND ON THE LIABILITY SIDE OF THE BALANCE SHEET THE CAPITAL PROVIDED FOR USE IS REPRESENTED IN THREE CONTROLLING ACCOUNTS VIZ CAPITAL STOCK SURPLUS AND UNDIVIDED PROFITS OF THESE THE FIRST TWO ITEMS ARE PERMANENTLY RESERVED FOR USE IN THE BUSINESS AND THE THIRD MUST REMAIN IN IT SO LONG AS THERE IS ANY QUESTION AS TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL RESOURCES BEFORE ANY COMPARISON MAY BE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING WHAT CHAR ACTER OF INVESTMENTS HAS BEEN MADE OF CAPITAL PUT INTO THE BUSINESS THE STATEMENT OF ASSETS REPORTED BY THE BANKS MUST BE ASSUMED TO BE BASED ON A PROPER VALUATION OR A CRITICAL EXAMINATION MUST BE HAD FOR THIS PURPOSE THE COMPTROLLER MAY SUPPLEMENT THE REPORT MADE BY THE BANK ITSELF WITH THE REPORT OF HIS EXAMINERS IN WHOSE FIELD THE BANK LIES OR MAY DETAIL A SPECIAL EXAMINER IF THE CASE SEEMS TO WARRANT SUCH AN ASSIGNMENT IN ANY CASE HOWEVER A DISTINCTION MUST BE MADE BETWEEN THE CURRENT ACCOUNTS AND THE CAPITAL ACCOUNTS CLASSIFICATION OF BALANCE SHEET TO SHOW FINANCIAL CONDITION INTELLIGENT JUDGMENT AS TO THE CHARACTER OF EQUIPMENT PROVIDED 53THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BY A BANK BY CAPITAL INVESTMENT REQUIRES A CLASSIFICATION OF RESOURCES THE EXERCISE OF OFFICIAL DISCRETION WITH REFERENCE TO THE INTEGRITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE EXAMINATION OF FINANCIAL REPORTS MAKES A CLASSIFIED BALANCE SHEET A NECESSITY TO THE END OF ESTABLISHING A BASIS FOR THE FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE FINANCIAL REPORT AS A MEANS OF CONTROL AND AT THE SAME TIME OF SHOWING SOME OF THE DIFFICULTIES WHICH STAND IN THE WAY OF THE EXERCISE OF EFFECTIVE CONTROL UNDER THE PRESENT FORM OF REPORT AN ANALYSIS OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF ALL THE NATIONAL BANKS OF THE STATE OF IOWA

EXHIBIT IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE VALUATION OF ASSETS REPRESENTED IN THE REPORTS OF THE COMPTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TROLLER IS CONSERVATIVELY MADE AND THAT THERE ARE NO BAD LOANS TO BE WRITTEN OFF BUT EVEN WITH THIS ASSUMPTION AND FOR THIS PURPOSE THE FORM OF REPORT MADE BY THE BANKS TO THE COMPTROLLER RENDERS MANY OF THE ITEMS DOUBTFUL I IN THE STATEMENT OF PRE MIUM ON BONDS AS ONE ELEMENT IN THE COMPUTATION OF THE AMOUNT OF CAPITAL LOCKED UP IN MARGIN THERE IS NO WAY OF DISTINGUISHING THIS FROM PREMIUM ON BONDS ON HAND 2 IN THE CASH ITEMS IT IS OF FREQUENT OCCURRENCE FOR BANKS TO INCLUDE EXPENSE VOUCHERS WHICH ARE TO BE HELD TILL THE END OF THE MONTH IN SO FAR AS THESE WERE INCLUDED THE STATEMENT OF THE AMOUNT OF CASH RESERVE IS TOO LARGE 3 THE AMOUNT STATED AS BALANCE KEPT WITH BANKS FOR EXCHANGE MUST BE ROUGHLY APPROXIMATED AS NO SPECIFIC INQUIRY IS MADE IN THE PRESENT FORM SUBMITTED BY THE COMPTROLLER TO DETER MINE THIS FACTTHE AMOUNT OF CLEARINGHOUSE EXCHANGES HELD IS I1410O ASSUMING THAT THE AMOUNT OF EXCHANGES OUTSTANDING AGAINST THE BANKS UNDER CONSIDERATION AVERAGES 175000 AND FURTHER THAT IT REQUIRES ON AN AVERAGE THREE DAYS FOR THEM TO BE PRESENTED AND PAIDTHE AVERAGE BALANCE NEEDED TO BE KEPT FOR THE REDEMPTION OF EXCHANGES WOULD BE 525000 ASSUMING AGAIN THAT FOUR TIMES THIS AVERAGE AMOUNT WOULD PLACE THE BANKS OF IOWA IN A POSITION AT ALL TIMES TO MEET EXCHANGES IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CARRY ONLV 21OO000 ON ACCOUNT WITH OTHER BANKS FOR EXCHANGE PURPOSES THIS AMOUNT IS ARBITRARILY SET UP 4 UNDER THE HEAD OF IN CUMBRANCES ON SECURITIES OWNED IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE BILLS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES STAND AS INCUMBRANCES ON STOCKS BONDS ETC THIS IS TRUE TO THE EXTENT ONLY THAT THESE LIABILITIES ARE BASED ON STOCKS AND BONDS HYPOTHECATED AS COLLATERALS AND IN SO FAR AS THIS IS NOT TRUE THE ACCOUNT WOULD BE VARIED BY AN EXACT RETURN SUCH AS MIGHT BE OBTAINED FROM THE BANK 5 THE AMOUNT EXHIBITED AS LOANS TO RESERVE AGENTS IS STATED ON THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE PURPOSE OF SUCH INVESTMENT IS TO HAVE A QUICKLY CONVERTIBLE ASSET BY MEANS OF WHICH CASH MAY BE OBTAINED WHEN THE MONEY RE SERVE RUNS LOWA BANK MAKING A STATEMENT TO THE COMPTROLLER UNDER A FORM CALLING FOR THIS SPECIFIC ITEM OF CAPITAL RESERVE MIGHT SET UP SOME OTHER FORM OF ASSET AS A DIRECT CAPITAL INVESTMENT IN EACH AND ALL OF THE ITEMS ABOVE MENTIONED THERE ARE ELEMENTS OF DOUBTELEMENTS WHICH REQUIRE QUESTIONS TO BE RAISED BUT EACH 56NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL OF THEM MIGHT BE MADE CERTAIN BY A DIFFERENT FORM OF INQUIRY SUB MITTED TO THE BANKS BY THE COMPTROLLER THE USES WHICH MAY BE MADE OF SUCH AN ANALYSIS BUT ASSUMING FOR THE PURPOSES OF PRESENT DISCUSSION THAT THE ABOVE ANALYSIS OF CAPITAL INVESTMENT WERE TRUE TO THE FACTS LET US SEE WHAT USE MIGHT BE MADE OF SUCH FORM OF REPORT IN THE FIRST PLACE WE MAY SEEK TO ELIMINATE THOSE INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE NOT IN THE NATURE OF BANKING EQUIPMENT THE BUILDING IN WHICH THE BANK IS HOUSED IS NOT ESSENTIALLY BANKING EQUIPMENT THE BANKING BUSINESS IS A CREDIT BUSINESS PRIMARILY IT CONSISTS OF THE EXCHANGE OF BANK CREDIT FOR COMMERCIAL CREDIT AT A PROFIT INVESTMENT IN A BUILDING DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE CONCERN IN ITS CURRENT CREDIT RELATIONS MANY OF THE LARGEST BANKING INSTITUTIONS DO NOT OWN A BUILDING THE PRIME PURPOSE OF CAPITALIZATION BEING TO PROVIDE EQUIPMENT WITH WHICH TO SUPPLY FUNDS TO THE COMMUNITY IN THE FORM OF DEMAND CREDIT ANY USE OF CAPITAL TO PURCHASE A BUILDING MUST BE CONSIDERED AS AN EXTRANEOUS INVESTMENT NOT AVAILABLE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE CREDIT OF A GOING CONCERN REAL ESTATE BELONGS TO THE SAME CLASS OF INVESTMENTS THIS HAS BEEN SO OFTEN SAID THAT IT HAS BECOME AXIOMATIC IN COMMERCIAL BANKING CIRCLES THE MARGIN INVESTED IN THE SECURITIES HYPOTHECATED WITH THE GOVERNMENT IS ALSO NOT AVAILABLE TO THE BUSINESS AS A GOING CONCERN ALL OF THE ABOVE CLASSES OF ASSETS ARE IMPORTANT AS ASSETS FOR FINAL LIQUIDATION BUT TO A GOING CONCERN THEY ARE PURELY VOLUNTARY AND ORNAMENTAL AND BEAR MUCH THE SAME RELATION TO THE BUSINESS OF BANKING THAT THE GILDED DOME ON THE CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY DOES TO THE VALUE OF ITS LITERARY STORES WITHIN WHETHER IN CONTEMPLATION OF LAW THIS AMOUNTS TO AN IM PAIRMENT OF CAPITAL OR NOT THE FACT REMAINS THAT 3397053 OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN THIS WAY HAS WEAKENED THE BANKS OF IOWA AS GOING CONCERNS AND TO THAT EXTENT ANOTHER CLASS OF CONSIDERATIONS ATTACHES TO THE REMAINING CLASSES OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTSTHOSE RESOURCES USED TO SUPPORT THE BANKING TRANSACTIONS THEMSELVES ASSUMING THAT THE BANKS HAD MADE RETURN OF REDEMPTION EQUIPMENT AS ABOVE EXHIBITED THE COMPTROLLER AS AN AGENT OF THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD KNOW WHETHER THIS EQUIPMENT IS ADAPTED TO THE USE FOR WHICH IT IS INTENDED THE UNENCUMBERED 57THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SECURITIES FOR EXAMPLE BEING INTENDED FOR AN INVESTED RESERVE TO STRENGTHEN THE CASH RESERVE HELD TO SUPPORT DEMAND ACCOUNTS DE POSITS OUTSTANDING THE QUESTION PERTINENT TO THIS USE IS ARE THESE SECURITIES IMMEDIATELY CONVERTIBLE BY SALE OR HYPOTHECATION WITHOUT LOSS OF PRINCIPAL IF AGAIN ANY OF THESE ARE HELD AS THE RESULT OF UNDERWRITING THIS FACT WOULD SUGGEST THAT A PORTION OF THE BANKS CAPITAL WAS BEING EMPLOYED IN BUSINESS OTHER THAN BANKING AND THERE WOULD BE AN IMPAIRMENT IN USE IF NOT IN VALUATION BY SOME SUCH CLASSIFICATION FACILITY WOULD BE GIVEN TO MANY OTHER OFFICIAL INQUIRIES DIRECTED TOWARD THE PROTECTION OF THE PEOPLE AGAINST IM PAIRMENT OF THE CAPITAL RESOURCES NEEDED BY A GOING BANKING CONCERN A POINT OF CONTROL NOT ADEQUATELY COVERED BY THE NATIONAL BANK ACT WHILE THE NATIONAL BANK ACT IS VERY SPECIFIC AS TO THE POWERS OF CONTROL DIRECTED AGAINST THE IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL THERE IS ANOTHER ELEMENT OF BANKING STRENGTH OR WEAKNESS QUITE AS IMPORTANT THAT HAS BEEN NEGLECTED VIZ THE PROTECTION OF THE CUSTOMER AGAINST OVERBURDENING THE EQUIPMENT USED JUDGMENT AS TO SAFETY MUST REST NOT ALONE AS TO THE ABSOLUTE STRENGTH OF MATERIAL USED IN CONSTRUC TION AND EQUIPMENT BUT THIS HAVING BEEN DETERMINED IT MUST THEN BE COMPARED WITH THE WEIGHT OR STRAIN TO BE SUPPORTED TO BE MORE CONCRETE EVERY FACILITY IS GIVEN TO SUCH INQUIRY AS THE COMP TROLLER MAY MAKE TO PROTECT THE CAPITAL PUT INTO THE BUSINESS AGAINST DETERIORATION BUT ALMOST NO PROVISION IS MADE FOR INQUIRY AS TO WHETHER THE CREDIT BURDEN IMPOSED BY THE BANK OFFICERS ON THIS EQUIPMENT IN THE PROSECUTION OF THE BUSINESS IS GREATER THAN IT CAN SAFELY BEAR THERE IS NO PROVISION MADE FOR CORRELATION OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT WITH THE CREDIT LIABILITIES INCURRED IN THE COURSE OF THE BANKING BUSINESS THESE OBLIGATIONS MUST BE MET ON DEMAND AND SAFETY REQUIRES THAT THEY SHOULD BE MET BY CAPITALIZATION THIS IS THE ESSENTIAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT HAS BEEN KNOWN AS WILDCAT BANKING AND SOUND BANKING AS CONTEMPLATED IN THE NATIONAL BANK ACT BANKING ACTIVITIES ARE REPRESENTED IN ITS CURRENT ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE CURRENT LIABILITIES INCURRED IN BANKING OPERATION TO CON

OF BANKING TRANSACTIONS IT APPEARS THAT BY MEANS OF A CAPITAL INVESTMENT OF 20501II4 A BANKING BUSINESS OF 68559080 WAS CARRIED ON WITH THESE RESULTS IN MIND LET US DETERMINE IN SO FAR AS WE MAY FROM THE DATA IN HAND WHAT STRAINTHE ANNALS OF THE ANMERICAN ACADEMY WAS BROUGHT ON CAPITAL EQUIPMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE ON WHAT PART OF THE EQUIPMENT DOES THE BANKING STRAIN COME AS BEFORE OBSERVED IT IS AT ONCE APPARENT THAT NO PART OF THE CREDIT STRAIN FALLS ON THE FIRST THREES CLASSES OF EQUIPMENT ENUMERATED VIZ I BANKING HOUSE AND FIXTURES 2 REAL ESTATE AND 3 MAR GINS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE DEMANDS OF COMMERCIAL BANKING THESE ARE PURELY A GRATUITOUS USE OF CAPITAL OWNERSHIP OF A HOUSE AND FURNISHINGS IS UNNECESSARYTHIS PARAPHERNALIA MAY BE LEASED AND THE RENT CHARGED TO CURRENT EXPENSES AND WHEN A BUILDING IS OWNED IT IS IN THE NATURE OF A REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT REAL ESTATE OWNED IS AN INCUMBRANCE ON BANKING CAPITAL AND NOT BANKING EQUIPMENT THE MARGINS INVESTED IN BONDS USED AS COLLATERALS FOR NOTES AND DEPOSITS ARE INCIDENTAL TO THE SYSTEM DE VISED BY THE GOVERNMENT TO STRENGTHEN ITS OWN CREDIT AND AS SUCH ARE NOT BANKING EQUIPMENTTHEY ARE A FURTHER INCUMBRANCE ON BANKING CAPITAL THE EQUIPMENT NECESSARY TO BANKING TRANSACTIONS IS THE CASH RESERVES OR SUCH INVESTED CAPITAL RESERVES AS MAY BE READILY CONVERTED INTO CASH AND WHICH MAY BE USED TO MEET DEMANDS ON OUTSTANDING CREDIT ACCOUNTS WITHOUT CURTAILING COMMERCIAL AC COMMODATION AS A MEANS OF CARRYING ON A BUSINESS WHICH CONSISTS IN THE EXCHANGE OF BANK CREDIT ACCOUNTS FOR INCOMEPRODUCING ASSETS IN THE NATURE OF CONLMERCIAL CREDIT THE BANK MUST ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN A REPUTATION FOR MEETING ITS CREDIT ACCOUNTS ON DEMAND THE ONLY WAY THAT THIS MAY BE DONE WITH SAFETY TO ITS CUSTOMERS IS BY HAVING CAPITAL RESOURCES IN THE FORM OF CASH WHEN DEMANDS ARE MADE THE REAL TEST OF BANKING STRENGTH THEREFORE IS TO BE FOUND I IN THE CASH ON HAND 2 IN EXCHANGE BALANCES AND 3 IN UNINCUMBERED SECURITIES AND OTHER CAPITAL INVESTMENTS READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH AGAIN ASSUMING THE VALUATION OF THESE CAPITAL ASSETS TO BE CONSERVATIVE THE STRENGTH OF BANKING EQUIPMENT OF THE STATE OF IOWA BY THIS METHOD OF ANALYSIS AT THE TIME STATED WAS 17104061 BUT A COMPARISON OF STRENGTH OF EQUIPMENT WITH THE CREDIT STRAIN UPON IT MUST BE ARRIVED AT BY BRINGING THE TWO RESULTS TO GETHER THE TOTAL DEMAND OBLIGATIONS FOR THE PAYMENT OF MONEY WERE IN ROUND NUMBERS 68559O80 THAT IS THE EQUIPMENT OF CASH AND IMMEDIATELY CONVERTIBLE CAPITAL RESOURCES IRRESPECTIVE OF 6ONATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL THE COMMERCIAL ASSETS BEING I7500000 AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF DEMAND CREDIT TO BE SUPPORTED 68500000 THE INVERTED PYRAMID WOULD BE 68500000 17500000 BUT INGETTINGAT THE AMOUNT OF THE STRAIN THAT WILL FALL ON THE CAPITAL RESOURCES THIS GROSS AMOUNT MUST BE REDUCED ELIMINATING BY SETOFF THE CURRENT INSTITUTIONAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THE RELATION OF CREDIT OUTSTANDING TO CAPITAL AS SETS EMPLOYED IN A STRICTLY BANKING BUSINESS WOULD BE 63200000 17500000 IN OTHER WORDS I7500000 INVESTED IN BANKING EQUIPMENT HAVE ENABLED THE BANKS OF IOWA TO PURCHASE ABOUT 63200000 OF INTERESTBEARING COMMERCIAL ASSETS BY MEANS OF ABOUT 63200000 OF THEIR OWN CREDIT ACCOUNTS SUPPORTED BY THIS EQUIPMENT THE CORPORATIONS HAVE A GROSS INCOME ABOUT FOUR TIMNES AS LARGE THROUGH BANKING OPERATION AS THEY WOULD HAVE BY DIRECT INVESTMENT OF THEIR CAPITAL IN COMMERCIAL PAPER AND THEY HAVE FURNISHED TO THE COMMUNITY CREDIT FUNDS WHICH DO THE WORK OF MONEY EQUAL TO ABOUT FOUR TIMES THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CIRCULATION BY DIRECT INVESTMENT THE PURPOSE OF CONTROL IS TO MAKE SUCH A BUSINESS SAFE AND THE DIFFERENTIAL OF SAFETY MUST BE DRAWN FROM EXPERIENCE LEAVING AN ADE QUATE MARGIN OF PROTECTION TO THE PUBLIC AGAINST CONTRACTION OF THE CIRCULATING MEDIUM AS WELL AS PROTECTNG CUSTOMERS AGAINST IMMEDIATE LOSS FROM NONPAYMENT THE NEED FOR A BETTER CORRELATION OF CAPITAL RESOURCES WITH BANKING OPERATIONS CARRIED ON MAY APPEAR THE MORE VIVIDLY BY COMPARISON OF THE SEVERAL CLASSES OF BANKS REPORTED62 THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COMPARATIVE RESULTS OF ANALYSIS OF DIFFERENT CLASSES OF

DETERMINED FROM THE BANK RETURNS MADE ON THE FORM NOW USED THE FOREGOING SUMMARY SHOWS THE DISPOSITION OF CAPITAL INVESTED IN THE BANKING BUSINESS IN THE VARIOUS CLASSES OF BANKS REPRESENTED FROM THIS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT WHILE IN A SINGLE AGRICULTURAL STATE LIKE IOWA THE BANKS AS A WHOLE BY THEIR OWN CAPITALIZATION HAVE PROVIDED THE EQUIPMENT USED TO SUPPORT THEIR OUTSTANDING CREDIT TAKING ALL OF THE BANKS OF THE UNITED STATES THEY HAVE PROVIDED NO CAPITAL FOR DIRECT INVESTMENT IN LOANS TO RESERVE AGENTS AND ASIDE FROM THE CASH RESERVES HAVE PROVIDED SCARCELY ENOUGH FOR ADEQUATE EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS THE BANKS IN RESERVE CITIES ARE IN ABOUT THE SAME RELATIVE CONDITION AS THOSE OF THE COUNTRY AT LARGE THE BANKS OF THE CENTRAL RESERVE CITIES HOW EVER HAVE NOT SUFFICIENT CAPITAL TO PROVIDE THEMSELVES WITH THE CUR RENT CASH RESERVES USED IN THE BUSINESS AND WHICH ARE REQUIRED OF THEM BY STATUTE AT THE DATE OF MAKING THE REPORT THE AMOUNT OF CASH PROVIDED THROUGH CAPITALIZATION BY THIS CLASS OF BANKSNATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL WAS ONLY 242 PER CENT OF THE NET BANKING LIABILITIES THE BALANCE OF THE AMOUNT OF CASH ON HAND TO SUPPORT OUTSTANDING ACCOUNTS AND TO MEET THE 25 PER CENT LEGAL REQUIREMENT HAD BEEN BORROWED JUDGMENT OF BANKERS AS TO WHETHER PRESENT CAPITALIZATION IS ADEQUATE IF ON THE OTHER HAND WE TAKE THE JUDGMENT OF BANKERS AS TO WHAT EQUIPMENT IS NECESSARY TO THE SAFE CONDUCT OF THEIR BUSINESS ANOTHER RESULT WILL BE OBTAINED FOR THIS PURPOSE IT MAY BE ASSUMED THAT A BANKER WILL KEEP NO MORE CASH ON HAND THAN SAFETY TO HIS BUSINESS REQUIRES IF HE DOES HE IS VIOLATING GOOD BUSINESS JUDGMENT THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF EXCHANGE ACCOUNTS AND OF INVESTMENTS MADE IN LOW INCOMEPRODUCING ASSETS FROM WHICH CASH MAY BE REALIZED BY QUICK TURNS TO SUPPORT CREDIT ACCOUNTS ASSUMING FURTHER THAT THE PRINCIPLE IS A SOUND ONE THAT SUCH ASSETS AS ARE PERMANENTLY EMPLOYED OR ARE CONTINUOUSLY NEEDED IN THE BUSINESS SHOULD BE PROCURED BY DIRECT INVESTMENT OF CAPITAL I E THAT A BUSINESS CONCERN ESPECIALLY A BANK SHOULD NOT OBTAIN ITS EQUIPMENT ON A FLOATING DEBTTHEN THE INADEQUACY OF CAPITAL MEASURED BY THE STANDARDS SET BY BANKERS THEMSELVES INCREASES AS WE PROCEED FROM PERIPHERY OF THE NATIONAL BANKING SYSTEM TOWARDS THIS CENTER TO EXHIBIT THIS IN TABULAR FORM THE RESULT OF FAILURE OF THE LAW TO REQUIRE SUCH CONTROL AS WILL PREVENT THE OVERTAXING OF CAPITAL RE SOURCES AND SUCH AS WILL INSURE THAT OUR COMMERCIAL BANKS DO BUSI NESS ON THEIR OWN CAPITAL WOULD APPEAR SOMETHING AS FOLLOWS COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF EQUIPMENT ACTUALLY USED BY THE SEVERAL

APPROXIMATED THE APPROXIMATION HERE GIVEN HOWEVER IS A DEDUCTION FROM LOANS TO RESERVE AGENTS ANOTHER ACCOUNT WHICH IS CARRIED AS AN INVESTED RESERVE FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUPPORTING THE CASH RESERVE AND THEREFORE ONE WHICH SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED AS TO THE SECURITIES HELD IN SO FAR AS THEY ARE NOT HELD AS RESERVE EQUIPMENT THEY ARE NOT A BANKING RESOURCE AND LIKE REAL ESTATE ARE IN THE NATURE OF AN ENCUMBRANCE ON BANKING CAPITAL SUCH ASSETS MUST BE EITHER FOR SUPPORT TO BANK CREDIT OR FOR DIRECT INVESTMENT IN EITHER CASE THE BANK SHOULD NOT BUY BONDS ON CREDIT TAKING THE CHARGES AGAINST CAPITAL AS THEY STAND AND THE REDEMPTION EQUIP MENT ACTUALLY USED WE FIND THAT FOR THE UNITED STATES IN THE JUDG MENT OF BANKERS THEMSELVES AS REFLECTED IN PRACTICE THE BANKS SHOULD HAVE PROVIDED 4O5OOOOOO MORE OF CAPITAL TO SUPPORT THEIR BUSINESS THAT IS TO PROPERLY SUPPORT 4392000000 OF CREDIT USED IN THE COURSE OF BANK OPERATIONS TO PURCHASE 4392000000 OF INCOME PRODUCING ASSETS THE EQUIPMENT WHICH WAS ACTUALLY USED SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROVIDED BY THE PROPRIETORS OF THE BUSINESS SUCH A PROVISION WOULD REQUIRE AN INCREASE OF 31 PER CENT IN TOTAL BANK CAPITALIZATION BUT FURTHER INQUIRY WOULD SHOW THAT ALL BUT 9 PER CENT OF THIS GROSS AMOUNT WOULD BE REQUIRED OF THE RESERVE CITIES AND THAT A VERY LARGE PORTION OF THE INCREASE IS NEEDED IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK INADEQUACY OF THE RESERVE REQUIREMENTS AGAIN I WISH TO AFFIRM THE POSITION BEFORE TAKENTHAT THIS IS NOT PROPOSED AS A TRUE METHOD OF ANALYSIS TO GET AT THE RELATION OF INTENSITY OF CREDIT STRAIN TO EQUIPMENT USED ATTENTION IS DIRECTED TO THE FACT ONLY THAT SUCH AN ELEMENT SHOULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT IN REPORTS THE PURPOSE OF WHICH IS TO FURNISH THE DATA FOR OFFICIAL CONTROL FURTHER IT IS SUGGESTED THAT NO PROVISION IS MADE IN THE PRESENT FORM OF REPORT FOR ASCERTAINING THESE DATA AND ONLY ONE PROVISION OF LAW IS MADE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST ANY OVER TAXING OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT THIS ONE PROVISION REFERRED TO IS THE CLAUSE WHICH IMPOSES A MINIMUM LIMIT IN MONEY RESERVE TO BE 64NATIONAL BANKS AS A MEANS OF PUBLIC CONTROL KEPT DRAWING ON EXPERIENCE AND ON THE EXPRESSION OF BANKING OPINION IN LEGAL FORM IN STATE PRACTICE BEFORE ADOPTION OF THE NATIONAL BANK ACT THE MINIMUM MONEY RESERVE TO BE KEPT BY COUNTRY BANKS WAS SET AT 15 PER CENT OF CREDIT ACCOUNTS OUTSTANDING AND FOR RESERVE CITY BANKS 25 PER CENT THIS CLAUSE WAS MODIFIED HOWEVER UNDER PRESSURE FROM THE BANKS SO THAT IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF CASH ON HAND THREEFIFTHS OF THE 15 PER CENT MONEY RESERVE OF COUNTRY BANKS MIGHT CONSIST OF LOANS TO RESERVE CITY BANKS AND ONEHALF OF THE MONEY RESERVE REQUIRED OF RESERVE CITY BANKS MIGHT CONSIST OF LOANS TO CENTRAL RESERVE CITY BANKS THIS LIMITATION IMPOSED DOES IN FACT OPERATE TO PREVENT SOME OF THE LEAST PROVIDENT BANKERS FROM BRINGING THEIR HOUSES DOWN ON THE HEADS OF CUSTOMERS AND PRECIPITATING A PANIC IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEVERTHELESS THE PROVISION IS ENTIRELY INADEQUATE TO PREVENT AN OVERTAXING OF EQUIPMENT TO ILLUSTRATE ONE OF THE METHODS USED FOR COMPLYING WITH THE LAW AND AT THE SAME TIME FOR CARRYING A LOAD THAT KEEPS THE INSTITUTION ON THE VERGE OF CREDIT COLLAPSE FROM THE PUBLISHED REPORTS IT APPEARS THAT A NUMBER OF BANKS HAVE INDIVIDUAL DEPBSITS OUTSTANDING AMOUNTING TO FROM TEN TO TWELVE TIMES THEIR CAPITALIZATION SOME OF THESE BANKS CONTINU OUSLY CARRY A CASH FUND LARGER THAN THEIR CAPITAL STOCK SURPLUS AND UNDIVIDED PROFITS WHERE DID THEY OBTAIN THIS MONEY UN DOUBTEDLY THEY BORROWED IT IN SEVERAL INSTANCES ONLY ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE EQUIPMENT CONSTANTLY USED BY THESE BANKS IS PROVIDED BY MEANS OF CAPITALIZATION THE BALANCE IS OBTAINED ON DEMAND LOANS IMAGINE ANOTHER ENTERPRISE BEING FINANCED IN THIS MANNER THE PRESENT CONDITION NOT THE FAULT OF THE BANKER BUT OF THE BANK ACT I AM NOT FINDING FAULT WITH A BANK FOR DOING BUSINESS IN THIS WAY IF A BANKER FINDS THAT HE MAY OBTAIN CAPITAL FROM OTHERS WITH WHICH TO DO BUSINESS AND THAT WHEN A SUDDEN DEMAND COMES FOR PAYMENT HE CAN FORCE HIS COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS TO FIND THE MEANS NECESSARY TO REPLACE THE TEMPORARY FOUNDATIONS WITHDRAWN IF BY SUCH METHODS THE BANKER MAY BE ABLE TO KEEP HIS OWN HOUSE FROM FALLING ON THE HEADS OF MANAGERS AND STOCKHOLDERS HE MAY BE EXONERATED ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT HE HAS AVAILED HIMSELF OF A BUSINESS 65THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ADVANTAGE WHICH HAS BROUGHT A LARGE RETURN IN PROFITS BUT THE PURPOSE OF CONTROL IS NOT TO PROTECT THE BANK FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE PURPOSE OF PUBLIC CONTROL WE ASK THE QUESTION WHAT IS THE RESULT OF THIS CHARACTER OF BANKING TO THE COMMERCIAL COMMU NITY AS A NATIONAL SYSTEM THIS IS SIMPLY ANOTHER FORM OF WILDCAT BANKING AND IT IS IN THIS VERY PRACTICE THAT WE FIND MUCH OF THE TROUBLE THAT HERETOFORE HAS BEEN ASCRIBED TO INELASTICITY OF THE CUR RENCY THE PRIME FAULT IS IN A LAW WHICH PERMITS BANK CAPITALIZA TION INADEQUATE TO MAINTAIN THE VOLUME OF BANK CREDIT OFFERED TO THE COMMUNITY WITH WHICH TO DO BUSINESS AND OF WHICH CUSTOMERS HAVE AVAILED THEMSELVES THIS BEING SUDDENLY WITHDRAWN TO PRO TECT THE BANK FROM ITS OWN WEAKNESS THE COMMUNITY IS LEFT IN A CRIPPLED CONDITION TO SHIFT FOR ITSELF ONE OF THE PURPOSES OF CONTROL SHOULD BE TO SECURE A BETTER COORDINATION BETWEEN THE VOLUME OF CREDIT ACCOUNTS SOLD AND CAPITAL EQUIPMENT PROVIDED AS A MEANS OF SUPPORT TO THIS END THE NATIONAL BANKING ACT NEEDS REVISION BUT HAVING BEEN REVISED SO AS TO GIVE THE COMPTROLLER POWER TO EXERCISE SUPERVISION TO PREVENT THE OVER STRAINING AS WELL AS THE IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL EQUIPMENT THE PRESENT POWER TO COMPEL REPORTS IS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THIS SUPERVISION EFFECTIVE ONE OF THE TWO PRINCIPAL PURPOSES OF THE BANK ACT IS TO GUARD THE INTEGRITY OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AGAINST LOSS ON ACCOUNT OF INADEQUATE CAPITALIZATION TO EFFECT THE FULL MEASURE OF GOOD INTENDED BY THE ACT TO VOUCHSAFE A SYSTEM OF CONTROL WHICH WILL SECURE SOUND BANKING AS WELL AS SOUND CURRENCY THERE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE PRESENT POWERS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO PROTECT AGAINST AN IMPAIRMENT OF CAPITAL INQUISITORY POWERS DIRECTED AGAINST AN OVERLOADING OF EQUIPMENT AS A MEANS OF EXECUTING THIS AUTHORITY CLASSIFIED SCHEDULES SHOULD BE DEVISED WHICH WILL FURNISH THE INFORMATION NECESSARY TO INTELLIGENT OFFICIAL DISCRETION AND CLASSIFIED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF RESULTS SHOULD BE PUBLISHED THAT THE PUBLIC MAY THE MORE INTELLIGENTLY DEAL WITH THE BANKS 66

NATURA CAGIONE E RIMEDI DELL INFERMITA REGNANTI NE ANIMALI BOVINI DI MOLTE CITTA C NELL AUTUNNO DEL ANNO CADENTE 1711 IN VENEZIA 1712 THE LEARNED AUTHOR OF THIS DISCOURSE HAPPEN ING TO SPEND SOME TIME IN THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE MONTH OF OCTOBER IN THE YEAR 1711 TOOK THAT OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING A PARTICULAR ENQUIRY INTO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE MORTALITY THAT THEN REIGND A MONG THE BLACK CATTLE IN THE VENETIAN TERRITORIES THE RESULT OF WHICH HE GIVES IN THIS RELATION HAVING BEEN AN EYEWITTNESS TO THE GREATEST PART OF THE FACTS HEREIN CONTAIND AND HAVING RECEIVD THE REST UPON THE PLACE FROM PERSONS OF INTEGRITY AND CREDIT ALMOST ALL THE SICK CATTLE REFUSED EVERY SORT OF FOOD AND DRINK THEY HUNG THEIR HEADS HAD SHIVERINGS IN THEIR SKIN AND IN THEIR LIMBS THEY BREATHD WITH DIFFICULTY AND THEIR EXPIRATION IN PARTICULAR WAS AT TENDED WITH A SORT OF RATTLING NOISE THEY WERE SO FEEBLE THAT THEY COULD SCARCELY GO OR STAND UPON THEIR LEGS SOME FEW OF THEM EAT A LITTLE AND DRANK VERY MUCH OTHERS HAD FLUXES OF EXCREMENTS VARI OUSLY COLOURD OF A VERY OFFENFIVE SMELL AND FRE QUENTLY TINGED WITH BLOOD MANY OF THEM HAD THEIR HEADS AND THEIR BELLIES SWELLD IN SUCH A MANNER THAT UPON CLAPPING THEM WITH THE HAND ON THEIR PAUN CHES84 CHES OR ALONG THE VERTEBRAE OF THE LOINS THEY SOUNDED LIKE A DRY BLADDER WHEN FULL BLOWN IN SOME THE URINE WAS VERY TURBID IN OTHERS OF A BRIGHT FLAME COLOUR IN COMPARING THE PULSES OF THE SOUND CAT TLE WITH THOSE OF THE DISEASD HE FOUND THE LATTER TO BE QUICKER AND WEAKER THERE WAS BUT LITTLE HEAT PERCEIVABLE BY THE TOUCH IN ANY OF THEM THEIR TONGUES WERE SOFT AND MOIST BUT THEIR BREATH WAS EXCEEDINGLY OFFENSIVE BESIDES THESE PARTICULARS HE WAS INFORMD BY THOSE WHO ATTENDED THE SICK CATTLE AND BY OTHER PERSONS WORTHY OF CREDIT THAT IN SOME OF THESE BEASTS THEY HAD OBSERVED CRUDE TUMORS IN SE VERAL PARTS OF THE BODY AS LIKEWISE WATERY PUSTULES AND DISORDERLY MOTIONS OF THE HEAD WITH DRY BLACK AND FISSURD TONGUES THAT IN OTHERS OF THEM THEY MET WITH TUMOURS THAT CAME TO MATURATION PUTRID MATTER ISSUING FROM THE MOUTH AND NOSTRILS WORMS IN THE FAECES AND IN THE EYES BLOODY SWEATS AND THE FALLING OFF OF THE HAIR IN COMPARING THE FLESH OF THE CATTLE DEAD OF THIS DISTEMPER WITH THAT OF OTHERS KILLD FOR THE MARKET HE FOUND THE MUSCLES IN THE FORMER LYING IMMEDI ATELY UNDER THE SKIN TO BE SOMETHING LIVID HAVING OPENED THE THREE CAVITIES OF THE BODY HE APPLIED HIM SELF WITH THE UTMOST DILIGENCE TO EXAMINE THE BRAIN WITH ITS MEMBRANES THE TRACHAEA OESOPHAGUS LUNGS HEART WITH ITS AURICLES THE VENA CAVA AORTA AND DIAPHRAGM THE LIVER SPLEEN AND OTHER PARTS OF THE LOWER VENTER IN ALL WHICH THERE WAS NO DISCERN ABLE DIFFERENCE EITHER AS TO FIGURE SIZE CONTENTS SI TUATION OR CONNEXION WITH THE NEIGHBOURING PARTS FROM WHAT WAS OBSERVD IN SOUND CATTLE KILLD BY THE BUTCHER EXCEPT THE PARTICULARS HEREAFTER MENTI OND THE BLOOD FOUND IN THE VENTRICLES OF THE HEART IN THE PULMONARY VESSELS IN THE AORTA AND CAVA85 CAVA THOUGH STILL WARM WAS CONSIDERABLY BLACKISH AND NEAR A COAGULATION IN OPENING THE UPPER AND MIDDLE CAVITY THE SCENT WAS OFFENSIVE BUT TOLERABLE ENOUGH WHEREAS THE STINK THAT PROCEEDED FROM THE LOWER BELLY WAS NOT TO BE ENDURD WITHOUT PREJUDICE IN SOME FEW CARCASSES THE VISCERA DIFFERD FROM THEIR NATURAL STATE WITH REGARD TO THEIR SIZE THEIR CONSIS TENCE THEIR CONTENTS COLOUR AND SMELL IN MANY OF THEM THE PAUNCH WAS FOUND VERY MUCH CONTRACTED AND DRYD WITH A HARD SUBSTANCE CONTAIND IN IT IN OTHERS THE LUNGS WERE SWELLD AND LIVID THE LIVER TUMIFIED AND THE BRAIN WATERY AND PUTRID UPON OBSERVING THE ABOVESAID STATE OF THE BLOOD IN THE CATTLE DEAD OF THIS DISTEMPER HE WAS DESI ROUS TO SEE WHAT CONDITION IT WAS IN WHILE THE SICK BEASTS WERE YET LIVING WITH WHICH DESIGN HAVING ORDERD SEVERAL OF THEM TO BE BLOODED HE FOUND THE BLOOD NOT TO ISSUE OUT OF THE VESSELS IN A CONTINUED STREAM AS USUAL BUT WITH A BROKEN AND INTERRUP TED FLUX ONE PART OF THE BLOOD NOT IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING ANOTHER HAVING CAUSD THE BLOOD TO BE RECEIVD IN PROPER VESSELS AND SUFFERD IT TO STAND FOR SOME TIME HE FOUND IT INTIRELY COAGULATED WITHOUT ANY SEPARATION OF THE SERUM AND ATTACHED TO THE SIDES OF THE VESSELS WITH A RETICULAR PELLICLE UPON THE SUR FACE EXPOSED TO THE AIR ALL THE CATTLE WHICH WERE BLOODED BEING EIGHTEEN IN NUMBER DIED IN A FEW DAYS AFTER THE BLEEDING ONE ONLY EXCEPTED IN WHICH THE VEIN WAS OPEND UPON ITS BEING FIRST TAKEN ILL HAVING ENUMERATED ALL THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DIS TEMPER THE AUTHOR CONCLUDES FROM THE WHOLE THAT THE SICKNESS AMONG THE CATTLE WAS A MALIGNANT PEST ILENTIAL FEVER KILLING ALMOST ALL THOSE THAT WERE IN FECTED WITH IT THE86 THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THIS HE TAKES TO BE A PRAE TERNATURAL THICKNESS OF THE BLOOD OCCASIOND BY A BE GINNING COAGULATION OF THOSE PARTS OF IT WHICH CON STITUTE THE CRASSAMENTUM WHEREBY THE GLOBULES OF THE BLOOD AND THE PARTICLES OF THE SERUM WERE IM PRISOND IN A SORT OF RETICULUM FORMD BY THE UNION OF THE FIBRES OF THE BLOOD THE OCCASIONAL CAUSE OF THIS SICKNESS HE DEDUCES FROM THE COLD AND WETNESS OF THE SEASON WHICH REIGND ALL THE PRECEEDING YEAR FROM OCTOBER 1710 TO NOVEMBER 1711 WHICH OBSERVATION IS WORTHY OF REMARK SINCE THE SEASON PRECEEDING THE MORTALITY AMONG THE CATTLE HERE IN ENGLAND WAS REMARKABLY DRY AND YET THE SYMPTOMS OF THE DISTEMPER AGREED WITH THOSE OBSERVD IN ITALY AS MAY APPEAR FROM THE AC COUNT GIVEN BY THE LEARNED MR BATES SURGEON TO HIS MA JESTYS HOUSHOLD IN PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS NO 358 FOR THE PARTICULAR MANNER IN WHICH THIS LEARNED GENTLEMAN ENDEAVOURS TO ACCOUNT MECHANICALLY FOR THE THICKNESS OF THE BLOOD IN THESE ANIMALS FROM THE CONDITION OF THE SEASON AND FROM THAT THICKNESS OF THE BLOOD TO DEDUCE ALL THE PARTICULAR SYMPTOMS OF THE DISTEMPER AS LIKEWISE FOR HIS CONJECTURES CON CERNING THOSE MEDICINES WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN SER VICEABLE TO THE SICK CATTLE HE NOT HAVING MADE TRYAL OF ANY WE MUST REFER THE CURIOUS TO THE TREATISE IT SELF F I N I S

altazi muth is too small The present building should be replaced by one of such size that collimators may be placed inside of the dome and as in the case of the prime ver tical a long focus lens and an azimuth mark should be provided For use with the meridian and prime vertical instruments three new chrono graphs are needed Special attention is called to the impor tance of a careful study of each instrument of the Observatory and a prompt publica tion of the results of such investigations LIBRARY The Library contains 18025 bound vol umes and 3891 pamphlets It is devoted to astronomy and mathematics and the allied sciences and is particularly rich in complete sets of the publications of obser vations academies and learned societies of Europe many of which are rare as well as modern treatises and reports of investi gations It is admirably arranged and is in excellent order The assistant librarian in charge has made considerable progress in the preparation of a comprehensive card catalogue which will render the material on the shelves much more available The appropriation of 750 which is now provided for the Library is not sufficient for its needs About 350 of this is re quired to keepl up the scientific journals and the works such as yearbooks which appear periodically The remainder of the appropriation is not sufficient to provide the new books engravings photographs and fixtures required and to fill up gaps in the Library when special opportunity offers It is recommended that the appropriation be increased to 1000 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS In the opinion of the Board there is urgently needed 1 A repair shop for the instrument maker 2 Residences for those who are regularly engaged in late night observations EXPENDITURES The expenditures for the Naval Observa tory are presented in Exhibit D From the manner in which the appro priations have been made it is not easy for the Board of Visitors to determine what portion of the expenditures

JR E C PICKERING ORMOND STONE WILLIAM R HARPER THE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICAN AGRICUL TURAL COLLEGES AND EXPERI MENT STATIONS THE fifteenth annual convention of the As sociation of American Agricultural Colleges and Experiment Stations was held at Wash ington D C November 12 to 14 Presi dent A W Harris of the University of Maine presided at the general sessions and delivered the presidents annual address This address set forth clearly the more im portant things for which the landgrant col leges stand and summarized the results of their work The landgrant act of 1862 was considered important not only as pro viding for agricultural education but as the first sufficient recognition of study and in vestigation as the basis of the best success in the arts and industries It also pro claimed the duty of the national govern ment to promote industrial education and in its results demonstrated the effectiveness SCIENCE 883N S VOL XIV No 362 of governmental cooperation The most important of the direct results of this act to agriculture was the experiment station If the agricultural college did nothing more than to establish maintain and officer the experiment station it would be justified many times over The establishment of the agricultural colleges also caused the strengthening and broadening of industrial education along all lines and has culminated in a great system of technical education  It is also a great result of the landgrant college to have asserted and established the doctrine that education in all its forms from the lowest to the highest is a State function in which the State has the fullest rights and for which it must bear the re sponsibility sharing the privilege and re sponsibility with private corporations only as it thinks best The speaker considered state aid and control in higher education as necessary to the bet inational development and especially so because in this way the results of higher education become the property of all the people The address concluded with an eloquent tribute to the memory and worth of Justin S Morrill The report of the Executive Committee presented by its chairman President H H Goodell of the Massachusetts Agricul tural College called the attention of the Association to the fact that the bill for the establishment of schools or departments of mining and hnetallurgy in connection with the landgrant colleges passed the Senate but failed to be called up in the House of Representatives during the last session of Congress The introduction of a similar bill into Congress early in its next session was recommended The report of the Committee on Revision of the Constitution called forth a vigorous discussion The Association refused to change its name Among the important amendments adopted were those providing that the election of officers shall be by bal lot upon nominations made on the floor of the convention and that the program of the annual conventions of the Association shall hereafter be made up and distributed sixty days before the meeting of the con vention and the subjects provided for consideration by a section at any conven tion of the Association shall concentrate the deliberations of the section upon not more than two main lines of discussion which lines shall so far as possible be re lated Not more than onethird of the working time of any annual convention of the Association shall be assigned to mis cellaneous business The Committee on Graduate Study at Washington reported that no progress had been made since the last convention in se curing a Government bureau in Washing ton for the administration of graduate work The Association directed the com mittee to continue its efforts in this direc tion and in the meantime to secure if prac ticable the same opportunities for study and research in other departments of the government as are at present afforded graduate students in the Department of Agriculture A resolution was also adopted by the Association recording its apprecia tion of the action of the government in making available the facilities for research and advanced work in the Department of Agriculture and expressing a desire that these facilities may be still further extended and that a national university devoted ex clusively to advanced study and graduate and research work be established The sixth report of progress was submit ted by the Committee on Methods of Teach ing Agriculture Attention was called to the publication by the Department of Agri culture of the syllabi of courses in agro techny rural engineering and rural eco nomics prepared by the committee last year In surveying the progress of agricul tural education in this country during re 884 SCIENCESCIENCE cent years the committee  found abundant evidence that the attitude of this Associa tion and the work of this committee as its representative have already borne good fruit in stimulating and aiding the move ment for the specialization of agricultural instruction in our colleges the strengthen ing of agricultural facultiesandthe bettering of the material equipment for agricultural education The committee announced its intention to prepare and publish during the coming year a report on the courses in agronomy in our agricultural colleges and the facilities for instruction in this subject The Committee on Cooperative Work be tween the Stations and the Department of Agriculture made the following recom mendations as supplementary to those em bodied in the report submitted at the last convention 1 When cooperation is desired by the station it is deemed advisa ble that the proposal for such cooperation be made to the department by the director of the experiment station where on the other hand the department desires the coop eration of the station it is deemed advisable that the proposal be made in the first in stance to the director rather than to mem bers of the staff 2 While it is well un derstood that no financial obligations can be undertaken beyond the end of the fiscal year yet it should be recognized that any arrangement for joint experimentation which requires some years to complete creates a moral obligation upon both parties to carry the work to a conclusion 3 Where a line of investigation has been in progress in any State under the auspices of either institution it is as a rule unwise for the other party to undertake independ ently the same line of investigation at least until after full consultation upon the sub ject The committee was continued with the addition of Professor B T Galloway of the Department of Agriculture 885 The report of the Committee on Index ing Agricultural Literature called attention to the fact that progress in this direction could not be made by the Department of Agriculture until its library was provided with funds for this purpose A paper on  Agricultural College Libraries prepared and presented by Miss Josephine A Clark librarian of the Department of Agriculture and a member of this committee completed the report This paper emphasized the great importance of libraries as aids to the work of investigation and instruction and pointed out the necessity of systematic arrangement and complete cataloguing of agricultural libraries Arrangements in progress by the library of the Department for assisting ag ricultural colleges in classifying and cata loguing their libraries were explained The report of the bibliographer A C True noted the work of a bibliographical character being done by the Department of Agriculture and enumerated with explana tory notes fortyfour general and partial bibliographies in lines relating to agricul ture issued during the past year The general plan of the graduate summer school of agriculture as proposed by the Ohio State University at the last conven tion and approved by the Executive Com mittee was explained by President W O Thompson of the University It was stated that sufficient encouragement had been received from the leaders of agricul tural education and research to warrant a decision to hold the first session of the school at the Ohio State University at Co lumbus Ohio during the summer of 1902 It was announced that Secretary Wilson had cordially approved the plan for this school and that acting under his advice Doctor A C True director of the Office of Experiment Stations had consented to act as dean of the school The Ohio State University makes itself responsible for the general management of the first session of DECEMBER 6 1901N S VOL XIV No 362 the school but if it proves a success it is proposed to make it a cooperative enter prise to be managed by a committee of control appointed by the Association Future sessions may be held at institutions in different parts of the country This plan for the school was endorsed by the Association and a prospectus of the first session will soon be issued The Association voted in favor of exhibits illustrating the progress of instruction and research in agriculture and the mechanic arts at the St Louis Exposition in 1903 and committees on these exhibits were appointed The resolution introduced by Professor W A Henry of Wisconsin was adopted by the Association urging upon Congress the necessity and wisdom of providing a building for the accommodation of the De partment of Agriculture which in magni tude shall be sufficient to provide for its future as well as present needs and which will properly represent in its architecture the enormous importance of agriculture in this country and which will constitute a worthy addition to the government build ings of the capital of the United States In the section on college work a paper on the relation of agricultural colleges to the proposed national university by Presi dent W O Thompson of the Ohio State University was presented in which the writer affirmed that in his judgment  the relation of the agricultural colleges to a national university should be that of sym pathetic cooperation and enthusiastic sup port as against all other measures whether proposed as substitutes or steppingstones This paper called forth a lively discussion in which it appeared that there was a general sentiment in the section in favor of securing some agency under government control for making the laboratories mu seums libraries and other educational facilities in Washington available to ad vanced students W M Liggett Dean of the College of Agriculture of the University of Minnesota read a paper on the value of short courses in which he described the different courses in agriculture given in Minnesota and stated that he considered the short courses valuable adjuncts to the longer courses Honorable J H Brigham Assistant Sec retary of Agriculture spoke of the short courses as a means not only of giving valuable instruction to farmers but also of bringing about more cordial relations between the agricultural colleges and farmers In his judgment the best way to secure the support of farmers is to let them come to the college even for a short time and see that you are trying to do good In the section on agriculture and chem istry considerable time was given to a con sideration of the question to what extent the Department of Agriculture and the ex periment stations may profitably cooperate in the study of grass and forage plant problems and the lines of work which are likely to yield the most important re sults Professor B T Galloway chief of the Bureau of Plant Industry gave a brief history of the cooperative forage plant work of the Department and the stations He expressed his opinion that the success of the movement depended on grouping the stations with reference to the problems to be solved in different sections of the country and devising a working plan for each group The following lines of work were suggested 1 The introduction of crops from foreign countries 2 growing and disseminating introduced crops after they have become in a measure established 3 dissemination of native crops of local value 4 breeding crops for certain conditions 5 increasing production by improved cultural methods Professor R H Forbes director of the Arizona Experimental Station described the grass and forage crop conditions of that Territory and gave an account of the co 886 SCIENCESCIENCE operative investigations carried on there These investigations have for their object the improvement of the ranges through the exclusion of live stock the sowing and har rowing in of seeds of native plants the in troduction of new forage plants suited to the arid region and the construction of small embankments for holding the storm water As conducted for two years on a reserve of 350 acres they have given prom ising results Professor F LamsonScrib ner agrostologist of the Department of Agriculture gave an account of the co operative work under his direction which includes arrangements with seventeen ex periment stations The problems of irrigation in humid re gions and the investigations in progress in this line were described and discussed by Professor Elwood Mead of the Office of Experiment Stations Professor E B Voorhees director of the New Jersey Ex periment Stations F H Newell of the U S Geological Survey and Professor H J Waters director of the Missouri Ex periment Station Papers on plant breeding were presented by Professor W J Stillman of the Wash ington Agricultural Experiment Station and Professor W M Hays of the Minne sota Experiment Station There was also a paper on the artificial plant food require ments of different soils and the methods employed in fertilizer experiments by Doc tor B W Kilgore director of the North Carolina Experiment Station In the report of the section on horticul ture and botany the marked strengthen ing of advanced courses in these subjects in colleges was pointed out The demand for especially qualified men in horticulture was stated to be greater than the supply There has recently been rapid progress in bacterial and physiological investigations and special studies on the selection and breeding of plants At the meeting of the 887 section therewas an earnest discussion of the relations of instruction and research in hor ticulture in the agricultural colleges called forth by a paper by Professor E S Goff of the University of Wisconsin The question of cooperation between the farmer and the experiment station and the best methods of such cooperation were also much dis cussed on the basis of the paper by J Craig of the New York Cornell Experiment Sta tion Other papers were also read in this section on observations concerning the first and second generations of plants2 by Pro fessor B D Halsted of the New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Stations on the effect of light and heat on the germination of Kentucky blue grass and on the quality of some commercial samples of grass and clover seed by E Brown of the Bureau of Plant Industry Professor L C Corbett of this Bureau described the experimental farm of the De partment of Agriculture which is being established on a part of the Arlington estate near Washington It is intended to plant on this farm extensive collections of varieties of fruits in order to have authen tically named specimens for comparative studies cultural experiments with fruits and crops and phenological investigations are also to be undertaken there Mr F D Gardner of the Office of Experiment Sta tions who is in charge of the newly estab lished experiment station at Porto Rico made an interesting exhibition of fruits which he had brought from that island and H J Webber of the Bureau of Plant Industry exhibited specimens of cowpeas which are believed to be resistant to the attacks of nematodes In this connection it may be well to state that a newly organized society of official horticultural inspectors for the United States and Canada held its sessions in Washington November 11 to 13 Repre sentatives from fifteen States were present DECEMBER 6 1901SCIENCE Professor S A Forbes of the University of Illinois presided With regard to the limits of time within which nurseries may be inspected it was found impossible to determine upon any definite period for all States since the local conditions require ments of State law and other demands of State inspectors rendered uniformity in this matter impossible In a discussion of the nursery pests which are to be regarded as dangerous enough to influence the grant ing of a certificate those mentioned by dif ferent inspectors as of chief importance in cluded the crown gall peach yellows pear blight San Jose scale woolly aphis and sinuate pear borer In a discussion of the question of the best insecticide for orchards infested with San Jose scale the fact was brought out that the results of experiments with kerosene crude petroleum and me chanical combinations of both these sub stances with water were not uniform in different States Resolutions were passed to the effect that the time of inspection should be left to the discretion of the in spector of each State that the certificate should not extend beyond the time of the beginning of the breeding period of the San Jose scale for the next year that one form of certificate should be issued as a rule which should be so worded that the stock could be sold after objectionable stock had been treated as suggested by the inspector and that in States which required inspec tion of nursery stock the expenses of in spection should be borne by the State The report of the section on entomology presented by Professor M V Slingerland of the Cornell University Experiment Sta tion reviewed the progress of entomology during the past year especially as regards instruction investigation and inspection At the meeting of the section the following papers were read  A Years Experience with Crude Petroleum in New Jersey by Professor J B Smith of the New Jersey Experiment Stations  Some of the most Important Insects in Massachusetts by Professor H T Fernald of the lIassachu setts Hatch Experiment Station  The Time of Emergence and Oviposition of the Spring

report of the section on mechanic arts was presented by Professor H W Tyler of the Boston School of Technology This gave at some length the progress of instruction in mechanic arts during the year A reception tendered to the Association by the Secretary of Agriculture and Miss Wilson was numerously attended by the delegates and their ladies and was thor oughly enjoyed by all who participated in it The following officers of the Association for the ensuing year were elected President W M Liggett of the College of Agriculture of the University of Minne sota VicePresidents W 0 Thompson of the

Nencki director of the Lab oratory of Physiological Chemistry in the Institute of Experimental Medicine at St Petersburg physiological chemistry has lost one of its most active workers Pro fessor Nencki was born in Poland January 15 1847 After completing his medical studies at Berlin he went to Berne in 1872 as assistant in the Pathological Institute of the Swiss University At the same time he became Privatdocent in physiological chem istry and his appointment to a chair in that subject in 1877 was among the earliest recognitions which the science received as an independent field of study In 1891 Professor Nencki went to St Petersburg to take charge of one of the laboratories in the newly founded Institute being succeeded at Berne by the late Professor Drechsel Of Professor Nenckis extensive contribu tions to organic chemistry physiological chemistry and bacteriology it will suffice here to recall his investigations on the chemistry of putrefaction and on the chem ical processes which take place in the in testine his studies on the behavior of aro matic bodies in the animal organism his thorough researches on the pigments of the blood and on animal pigments in general the investigation of the formation of am monia and urea in mammals  and his last published paper with N Sieber on the chemical composition of enzymes In 1897 on the twentyfifth anniversary of the be ginning of his scientific activity there appeared a volume entitled  Sommaire des travaux accomplis par M le professeur M Nencki et ses 61lves dans ses laboratoires I Berne et A St Petersbourg

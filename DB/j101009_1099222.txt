intended as equivalent to a remainder  to the whole line of the issue of S or to the general issue of S the opinion does not state Whether it was or not could make no possible differ ence after the abolition of the rule in Shelleys Case since it would operate as a contingent remainder in either case and identically the same parties would take as remaindermen It would seem therefore to be fair to presume that the court did not attempt to define with absolute precision the technical language in which the implied remainder should be couched It might be added upon the authority of Smith v Chapman 1 H  M 298 Judge Roanes opinion that since the ultimate remainder in this case was for the life of the remaindermen only an intention was thereby shown to restrict the word issue to children of the first degree only But this point is not mentioned in the decision Thus it will be seen that out of the three Virginia cases one decides nothing of the two remaining one leans each way The counsel who may hereafter have to uphold either view need surely not despair RALEIGH C MINOR University of Virginia A QUESTION UNDER THE BANKRUPT ACT MAY ONE WHO HAS MADE A GENERAL DEED OF ASSIGNMENT BE ADJUDGED A BANKRUPT WHERE HE IS SOLVENT AT THE TIME OF FILING THE PETITION In the construction of the recent Bankrupt Act passed by Congress and approved July 1 1898 many interesting points will be raised by the alleged bankrupt and the petitioning creditors In Lea v West 4 Va Law Reg 662 Judge Waddill held that a general deed of as signment for the benefit of creditors was an act of bankruptcy whether the grantor was solvent or insolvent By section 3 subdivision 4 this is undoubtedly true The fourth ground of bankrupty can be com mitted either by a solvent or insolvent debtor Insolvency by the statute is not a constituent element of this ground of bankruptcy as it is in the second and third grounds of bankruptcy But while in solvency is not a constituent element of all acts of bankruptcy yet by section 3 b it is an essential that the alleged bankrupt be insolA QUESTION UNDER THE BANKRUPT ACT vent at the filing of the petition It is therefore proposed in this article not to dispute the proposition that insolvency is immaterial in the first fourth and fifth grounds of bankruptcy but to maintain that the petition can be filed only against a person who at the time of filing such petition isinsolvent There is no intention to criticise the learned judge the opinion is correct so far as it goes yet it is thought that the provision of section 3 b which provides that A petition may be filed against a person who is insolvent and who has com mitted an act of bankruptcy within four months after the commission of such act has been overlooked By the act of 1867 there were eight grounds or acts of bankruptcy In one of them the seventh where property was conveyed with the intent to give a preference or to otherwise defeat or delay the opera tion of the bankrupt law insolvency or the contemplation of insol vency in the alleged bankrupt was a necessary or constituent element Rev Stat 18734 sec 5021 subsection 7 Bump on Bankruptcy 10th ed p 421 and cases cited In the other seven acts of bank ruptcy it was immaterial whether the debtor was solvent or insolvent and the courts repeatedly held that it was not an element of these acts of bankruptcy that the debtor be at the time of committing them solvent or insolvent or in contemplation of bankruptcy or insolvency nor was any allegation to that effect necessary In re Dunham  Orr 2 B R 17 s c 1 L T B 89 s c 2 Ben 488 In re Randall  Sunderland 3 B R 18 s c 1 Deady 557 s c 2 L T B 69 In re Nickodemus 3 B R 230 s c 1 L T B 140 s c 2 C L N 49 s c 16 Pitts L J 233 In re Thomas Ryan 2 Saw 411 Bump on Bankruptcy 10th ed p 408 Insolvency at the time of committing the act of bankruptcy was not in seven cases a constituent element and a petition in involuntary bankruptcy could be filed against anyone committing one of these acts whether at the time of committing such act or at the time of filing the petition the party proceeded against be solvent or insolvent To support a peti tion in involuntary bankruptcy under the act of 1867 only one thing was needfulthat the party proceeded against should have committed within six months an act of bankruptcy It was not necessary that at the time of filing the petition that alleged bankrupt be insolvent One thing alone was essentialan act of bankruptcy which might or might not require that the person committing it be insolvent Under the present law two things are necessary to the filing of a petition in involuntary bankruptcy First that the alleged bankrupt 1899 813VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER has committed within four months previously an act of bankruptcy to which insolvency may or may not be essential and second that at the time of filing the petition the person proceeded against be insol vent Sections 3 a and 3 b Section 3 b provides A petition may be filed against a person who is insolvent and who has committed an act of bankruptcy within four months from the commission of such act Section 3 a provides what are these acts In only two of them the second and third is insolvency made a constituent element and the learned judge seems to be correct when he holds that in the fourth act or ground of bankruptcy it is immaterial whether at the time of the commission of the act the alleged bankrupt be solvent or insolvent Insolvency is not an essential element of the first fourth or fifth acts of bankruptcy But the question is How can a petition be filed against one who is at the time of the filing perfectly solvent  By section 3 b insolvency though not always a necessary element in the act of bankruptcy is a prerequisite to the filing of the petition This as the statute pro vides can be filed only against an insolvent Insolvent when Not at the time of the commission of the act of bankruptcy for some acts do not require that the person committing them be insolvent but in solvency at the time of filing the petition for the statute xpressly says that the petition may be filed against a person who is insolvent and who has committed within the four months previous an act of bank ruptcy A fair construction of sections 3 a and 3 b would seem to support the conclusion pointed out abovethat to warrant the bank rupt court in administering the trust the alleged bankrupt must have committed one of the five acts of bankruptcy witlin the four months previous to the filing of the petition and at the time of the filing of the petition he must be insolvent We know of no decisions to sup port this position the law is a new one and must yet be interpreted by the Supreme Court It will be well however to examine the authorities cited by the court to see if they contain anything contrary to the proposed con struction and also whether they support the proposition laid down in Lea v West supra that a general deed of assignment for the benefit of creditors is of itself sufficient to give jurisdiction to the bankrupt court whether the alleged bankrupt be solvent or insolvent All the cases cited by the learned judge were decided under the law of 1867 which did not require that the petition be filed against an insolvent but required only that the person proceeded against should have com 814 AprilA QUESTION UNDER THE BANKRUPT ACT mitted an act of bankruptcy within the six months previous to the filing of the petition From this alone it would seem that the cases cited are not authority under the present law which requires insolvency at the time of the filing of the petition But passing this objection by we shall see that there is further objection to the cases cited The case chiefly relied upon is Boese v King 108 U S 385 in which Mr Justice Harlan used the following language  It is equally clear we think that an assignment by Locke of his entire prop erty to be disposed of as prescribed by the statute of New Jersey and therefore independently of the bankrupt court constitutes itself an act of bankruptcy for which upon the petition of a creditor within the proper time Locke could have been adjudged a bankrupt and the property wrested from his assignee for admin istration in the bankrupt court The court however held that the petitioning creditors had waited too longmore than the six months provided in the act of 1867 and dismissed the petition The case was not decided upon the question of solvency or insolvency but upon the point that the petition had not been brought within the prescribed time So far as the case re lates to the question of solvency it is merely a dictum But again granting that the case states the law at that time correctly and no one denies that it does there was a provision in the law of 1867 very different from the present act Any conveyance made with the intent to defeat or delay the act of 1867 was an act of bankruptcy This is not made a ground of bankruptcy under the present law Nowhere in the case does it appear that the question of solvency or insolvency was raised Locke had committed an act of bankruptcy under the then existing law and that act was sufficient to sustain a petition in involuntary bankruptcy by his creditors if such petition was brought in the proper time Insolvency at the time of the filing of the petition was not required by the law at that time Black on Bankruptcy p 20 cited by the court in Lea v West supra certainly does not support the position of the court in the following language  In this country it is well settled upon the authorities that a general assign ment made by an insolvent debtor italics ours is an act of bankruptcy although it embraces all his property and purports to be made for the equal benefit of all his creditors and creates or intends to create no preferences and is free fiom fraud and although he denies any intention to evade or defeat the bankruptcy act etc Surely this does not support the claim that a general deed of assign ment made by a solvent is of itself sufficient to sustain a petition in in voluntary bankruptcy 1899 815VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER In re Burt 1 Dill 439 Fed Cases No 2210 In re Smith Fed Cases No 12974 cited by the court in Lea v West supra to sustain its position are cited both by Black on Bankruptcy p 20 and by Bump on Bankruptcy 10th ed p 421 to the effect that a general deed of assignment by an insolvent debtor made with the intent to defeat or delay the operation of the old bankrupt law is an act of bankruptcy As has been said above such a conveyance with such an intent was under the act of 1867 an act of bankruptcy for which alone the person committing it could be put into involuntary bankruptcy The cases do not seem to support the position of the court Let us now look to the reasoning of the decision In Lea v West p 663 the following language is used And the law particularly provides in involuntary cases for contesting the first second and third grounds of bankruptcy by allowing the bankrupt to dis prove his alleged insolvency and the burden of proving solvency is placed on him This is not an exact statement of the law The burden of proving solvency is not in all cases put upon the alleged bankrupt Section 3 c places it absolutely upon him where the proceedings are instituted un der the first subdivision of section 3 but where the proceedings are under the second and third subdivisions of that section section 3 d places the burden of proving solvency conditionally upon the party proceeded against It is not absolutely placed upon him Again the insolvency referred to in section 3 c must be at the filing of the peti tion It is insolvency at that time and not at the commission of the act of bankruptcy to which this section seems to refer while the word  insolvency in section 3 d would seem to refer to the insol vency at the time of the commission of the act of bankruptcy which is necessary to the completion of the second and third acts of bank ruptcy This view is strengthened by the fact that insolvency is not essential to the completion of the first act of bankruptcy as it is to the second and third and by the fact that insolvency in section 3 c is limited to the time of filing the petition while it is not so limited in section 3 d To the argument that no provision has been made for contesting the fourth and fifth acts of bankruptcy upon the grounds of solvency it may be replied that insolvency is not necessary to the completion of these acts that they may be committed by solvents and insolvents alike but that insolvency at the time of filing the petition is the bone 816 AprilA QUESTION UNDER THE BANKRUPT ACT of contention We cannot agree that the question of insolvency is not one open to dispute when this view of the matter is taken A man may be insolvent at the commission of the act of bankruptcy and by some fortuitous chance be perfectly solvent at the time of filing the petition against him Must he have his property tied up in the bank ruptcy court to please some creditor who may have a grudge or to allow the bankrupt court to administer the trust pay off the liabili ties and distribute the assets just to see if it has jurisdiction This seems to be the position taken by the court Suppose that after ad ministering the trust the court finds that the party proceeded against is perfectly solvent what will be its authority for its action The court is without jurisdiction the law was not intended for administer ing the assets of a solvent person Surely one so fortunate may pay his debts as he chooses Insolvency at the time of filing the petition is as essential to the jurisdiction as the commission of an act of bankruptcy within the four months previous The statute expressly says that a petition may be filed against a person who is insolvent and twho has committed an act of bankruptcy within four months after the commission of such act Section 3 b And it would seem that both the insolvency at that time and the commission of the act of bankruptcy within the four months previous must be alleged in the petition and proved unless the law makes an exception in some case as it has by section 3 c where the proceedings are instituted under the first subdivision There it would seem that both the insolvency and the act must be set out in the peti tion but the burden of proving solvency is upon the party proceeded against GEORGE PILCHER Norfolk Va 1899 817

THE SNOWY HERON IN UTAH By ANTWONET EDWARD AND A O TREGANZA WITH MAP AND ONE PHOTO BY G R WALKER S IXTY miles north of Salt Lake City where the Bear River empties into Bear River Bay an inlet of the Great Salt Lake thousands upon thous ands of acres are covered by a tortuous weaving water web of overflow and springrun deviously patterning its surface with mud flat alkaline bed grass grown islet open reach of waterall weft from lake shore to mountain with rank growth of tule and rushes and so on down the eastern shore of the lake though somewhat lesser in extent continue these same marshes even accompanying the Jordan River to its narrows at the north end of Utah Lake In the spring of 1904 through the courtesy and hospitality of Mr Chas Knudson of Brigham City Utah we were permitted our first knowledge of the great Bear River Marshes Arriving at his home late in the afternoon the evening was spent listening to tales of the late sixties and early seventies when he and his brothers as boys saw the completion of the Central Pacific Railroad which linked the East with the new West how as ardent inquisitive youths they spent much of their time wandering about this vast expanse of slough learning little by little the secrets it held Here they found many species of birds whose home life they studied with eager interest They had no text book to guide them but named each in their own vernacularthe Great Blue Heron they called the Blue Crane the Blackcrowned Night Heron the Squawk the Snowy Heron the White Squawk and the Longbilled Curlew Willet Avocet and Blacknecked Stilt all went by the name of Snipe Each spring and fall they noted the myriads of migratory birds passing over these marshes and love for the feathered life grew deep within them As the years went by they gradually acquired this land every alternate section from the railroad some246 THE CONDOR Vol XVI school lands from the State and some by reclamation until now they possess 10000 acres of the best feeding and breeding ground for water birds in the intermountain country He also told of a Government man who came out in the early seventies with a survey party to seek some knowledge of the Utah birds how he paid what seemed to them fabulous prices for eggs which they brought to him from marsh and mountain how he and Mr James Pett con tinued collecting specimens which they sent on to this man at Washington We asked if it were not H W Henshaw and he seemed to feel quite sure that was the name The following morning we went by team to the outskirts of the marshes MR k Fig 71 NEST OF THE SNOWY HERON BEAR RIVER UTAH MAY 1 1910 where Mr Knudson secured for us a specimen of the White Squawk which proved to be the Snowy Heron Ardea candidissima He also pointed out the approximate location of the rookery where this bird had nested in company with the Great Blue and Blackcrowned Night Heron since his first knowledge of the marshes Each successive year we noted many of these birds flying about but our time being limited and the rookery not easy of access it was not until April 22 1910 that Edward Treganza reached the colony Each year since one or all three of us have visited this heronry endeavoring to ascertain if these birds were increasing It is opportune to note here that this information with otherNov1914 FORTYFIVE YEAR HISTORY OF THE SNOWY HERON IN UTAH 247 records of Utah breeding birds we had hoped to complete very soon but a recent communication from H W Carriger containing a just rebuke from Professor Grinnell for withholding these records has hastened their transcrip tion Lest we had forgotten some detail of Mr Knudsons reminiscences and in the hope of gathering some new bit of information Sunday last August 30 we again visited him to hear anew his story He told us of the many offers made him for the purchase of these lands but he had loved and protected the wild fowl from boyhood and could not part with them nowonly to the Govern ment would he sell which could offer the birds even more protection by estab lishing a well guarded preserve A few years ago a diminished supply of water from the Bear River threatened the destruction of these marshes but since the construction of an immense power plant a permanent supply of water is assured and these wonderful breeding grounds teeming with bird life will remain a heritage to posterity Since the building of the Lucin Cutoff which keeps the salt water of the Lake confined to the mouth of the bay the Bear River is gradually freshening and the saline matter is slowly being washed out making it more healthful and affording better food for the birds FROM DIARY AND FIELD NOTES Bear River Utah April 22 23 1910Of sixtyfour nests counted by Ed ward Treganza only a few contained eggs A single colony found nesting in company with the Great Blue and Blackcrowned Night Heron Here the rushes were solid enough to sustain ones weight Each years tules withering bowed their heads to the water until successive years growths matted one upon an other undulating in parched yellow waves the troughs of which the herons chose for their nests Along the ragged edges where the new green growth appeared an occasional nest was found constructed of broken down reeds and rushes woven into a secure platform and resting but a few inches above the water Bear River Utah May 1 2 1910G R Walker J A Mullen and the Treganzas again visited the Snowy Heron rookery Nearly all the nests at this date contained full clutches ranging from three to six eggs four and five being the usual complement Following are the measurements of four sets taken from this colony Set of six 173x130 171x129 177x130 175x1275 172x129 179x122 Set of six 171x129 168x126 170x131 173x127 167x127 171x130 Set of five

having been deposited by another bird Both size and color of this egg shows considerable variation from the others Bear River Utah April 11 12 1911Edward Treganza made an effort to reach the rookeries hoping to secure some Great Blue Heron eggs and to ascertain if any of the Snowy Heron had arrived but on the night of April 11 a terrible storm blew up bringing with it a heavy fall of snow and a sudden plunge downward of the thermometer248 THE CONDOR Vol XVI This storm continued and the cold was so intense that a thin ice formed on the small still pools making the trip to the rookery impossible No Snowy Heron were seen but a few Whitefaced Glossy Ibis were noted and in as much as the Snowy Heron precede the Ibis from a week to ten days it is reasonable to suppose that they too were somewhere present Bear River Marshes April 23 1912Snowy Heron rookery visited Many nests completed but no eggs Number of birds noted indicated about thirty percent increase Black Sloughs Salt Lake County May 25 1912Dr D More Lindsay and Morton Cheeseman brought us the information that they had found both the Snowy Heron and the Whitefaced Glossy Ibis breeding at our old stamp ing grounds in the Black Sloughs so Edward Treganza immediately set out to ascertain the size of this new colony About fifty pairs of Snowy Heron and one hundred pairs of Ibis were found nesting together all the nests being newly constructed in the young tule growth This is the first record we have of the breeding of this bird south of the Bear River Boxelder County for each year since 1903 we have thoroughly worked the marsh country of Salt Lake County especially that portion traversed by the overflow of the Salt Lake Drainage Canal and known as the Black Sloughs 1913This year we decided not to disturb the Snowy Heron in either the old or new colony but three times we went close enough to the rookeries to note a marked increase in numbers Bear River Boxelder County Utah May 2 1914This date found us in the marsh country destined for the rookeries Within half a mile we noted a number of Snowy Herons rise at our right whereupon we immediately secured a boat and set out to make investigation We nosed into the dense tule growth to moor our boat and had just started to break our way With the first crackle of the reeds head after head was seen to rise long canelike necks stretched up for inquiry pure white birds and in close proximity an iridescent black one the Ibis with their curved bills looking for all the world like quaint old Jews lacking but spectacles and a skull cap Another breaking of reeds and the whole colony rose en masse a worrying confusion of wings and squawks and dangling legs and for once we were actually convinced that white was black and black was white so confounded were Heron and Ibis This colony covered an area twenty yards wide by one hundred yards long and contained no less than one hundred and fifty pairs of Snowy Heron and about one hun dred pairs of Whitefaced Glossy Ibis All of the Ibis nests and many of the Herons were under construction while some of the latter contained four to five fresh eggs Having traversed this portion of the marsh at least once an nually we were surprised to find this new and larger colony for previous years it contained only ducks and a very small colony of Blackcrowned Night Heron All the nests were constructed of the growing reeds and rushes Though quite dense there was little matted down growth of years previous thus much resembling the site of Black Sloughs Salt Lake County Bear River Marshes Boxelder County May 9 1914This day we were in quest of Longbilled Curlew Neither old or new heronry was visited but many birds were seen circling above the marsh Bear River Marshes Boxelder County May 16 1914The new colony of Ibis and Heron was visited All the Heron nests now seemed to be occupied by sitting birds on full clutches No nest was found to contain more than five eggs while about thirty percent contained only fourNov1914 FORTYFIVE YEAR HISTORY OF THE SNOWY HERON IN UTAH 249 Here is food for thought for all ornithologists even those who have much wisdom and would theorize on that

too the immensity of undisturbed marsh affording the best of both feeding and breeding grounds together with the mild climate of the winters in this Great Basin where the temperature rarely drops to zero may offer a justification for its residence here The birds have increased since our first observations for annually they are spreading out into new colonies How much real increase this may mean we are unable to estimate for Mr Knudson tells us that in years past the birds returning each spring fluctuated in number one spring would find a large colony returned the following spring only a few pair would occupy the rookery Is this to be laid at the door of the plume hunter or did a portion of the birds choose another locality for that year But the very marked increase since 1904 would indicate that the protection afforded the Snowy Heron here and elsewhere is having its effect At our last Legis lature a law was passed protecting all bird life in the State except the Mag pie and the law has not lacked enforcement Mr Fred Chambers State Game Commissioner with his deputies and Mr James Knudson State and Federal Deputy Warden have exerted untiring vigilance for the protection of all wild life in Utah Salt Lake City Septembcr 10o g94

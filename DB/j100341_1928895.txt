BUSINESS activity and wholesale commodity prices receded slightly in November as is evidenced by the downward movement of curve B of our index chart representing business Although the gains of the early fall have thus not been fully maintained nevertheless the level of the last month was above that of the early summer Increases in Bradstreets commodity price index since the low level are chiefly responsible for maintaining curve B at its present height The move ments of the speculation and money curves give indica tions more favorable to business advance than at any time during the past four months Curve C represent ing money again moved downward at about the same rapid rate that has been maintained since June Such a decline usually precedes and hence forecasts a marked upward movement of curve A representing speculation and then a rise of curve B representing business This effect has now clearly shown itself in curve A The latter moved upward during the month to a position higher than it has held during the preceding four months The advance during November has been substantial after three months of slow and halting improvement from the low point reached in July Although a rise of curve A for two consecutive months would give greater assurance of the permanence of the improvement shown the present upward movement is significant because certain conditions conducive to speculative activity are now present Interest rates have decreased bond prices have risen since the end of June and the investment market is now strong and active Conditions for an immediate upward movement of business are not yet present but a continuance of the upward movement of curve A representing speculation which became pro nounced during November and the expected persist ence of easier money conditions represented by curve C mean a significant improvement in business conditions in the spring of I922 On the index chart we find that the curve representing speculation has moved sharply upward while the curve representing money is sharply falling Such a move ment of the two curves normally precedes an active stock market Their present relation is just the reverse of that which obtained in January I920 when curve C rising abruptly crossed curve A which was declining rapidly from the high level of the previous year and this changed relation expresses very accurately and strikingly the difference between the business conditions existing at the two dates 5 ANY bCitU Ba nk Clearingtr Stc BBJtc 4 LPrice of Industrial Stocks   5 B rNLdCtireetPrice Incetsidi lg1i C JRte on

are plotted in the middle of the spaces allotted to the months EXPLANATION Each of the three curves on the Index Chart is obtained by averaging a group of statistical series each group being composed of series homogeneous in character i e when corrected for the seasonal influence and normal growth the series of each group move in the same direction up ward or downward at the same time The series were all expressed in com parable units before averages were taken Our interpretation of the fluctuations of the three curves of the current index chart is based upon the relationship which was discovered among simi lar curves for the period I903I4 All three curves had wave movements but the upward swings and the crests of the waves were not reached simultane ously The major movements of speculation preceded those of business by 4 to io months and the movements of business preceded those of banking by 2 to 8 months The persistent decline of curve A and the equally persistent rise of curve C both movements beginning in November ioio indicated that a decline of business activity and commodity prices curve B would be inaugurated in the spring of I1920 In fact business unsettlement was noticeable in April of that year The existence of the federal reserve system enabled us to avoid a financial panic but not a severe industrial depression In October IO 20 we made the forecast that the recession of business curve B now in progress will terminate by April I92I Examination of curve B now shows that the lowest point of the depression was reached last May and that there has been improvement since then The process has however been extremely slow Since June curve C representing money has moved downward sharply re flecting decreased interest rates A decline of curve C usually precedes and hence forecasts an upward movement of curve A representing speculation and then of curve B representing business Cturve A has risen substantially in No vember after three months of slow and halting recovery from the low point reached in July This upward movement of curve A shows for the first time in a signifi cant fashion the expected result of easier money conditions evidenced by the decline in curve C The movement of these two curves forecasts a significant rise of curve B representing business which is now above the level reached in the depth of the depression last May 1 All the series upon which curve A is based advanced during November New York bank clearings were 5 per cent above those for October they are usually 5 to 6 per cent less Shares traded on the New York Stock  37I 372 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS II ECONOMIC SUMMARY The growth of investment funds despite the lack of business profits decreased interest rates and the higher prices for investment securities are natural at this stage of the business cycle We are just beginning to emerge from a condition of profound business depres sion Prices have fallen abruptly bank loans have been to a large extent liquidated and note circulation has been greatly curtailed The position of the banks has been greatly strengthened not only by these last two factors but also by the accumulation of gold in the bank reserves of the United States because of the large excess of gold imports over gold exports Business now at a low ebb as to production and with prices greatly de creased does not absorb the funds previously needed for current operation The surplus funds of the banks and of business interests have thus expanded and are now seeking investment Speculation and investment in industrial stocks have been deterred by the small profits to be realized from industry hence these funds have found an outlet in government securities and bonds rather than seeking investment in stocks or being used for speculation With further accumulation of funds however the narrowness of such outlets the decreasing return to be gained and the attractiveness of low stock prices tend to bring more and more money into the stock market The increase in stock prices and activity on the New York Stock Exchange during November is the first tangible evidence that easier money conditions are having their expected result Two othcir factors less immediate in their effects than those just discussed are favorable to future business development Recent action of the Interstate Com merce Commission and Railroad Labor Board points toward a not too remote readjustment of railroad rates and wages In the second place the proposal for the limitation of naval armaments made by the United States gives promise of a curtailment of governmental expense Such curtailment in the United States would lift a portion of the burden of governmental expenditure from American industry For Europe as a whole the lightening of the burden of armament would mean more rapid recovery which would react favorably upon the economic situation here Beyond these merely mate rial results the improvement in international relation ships expected from the conference will go far to allay international distrust and restore confidence SPECULATION The prices of securities recorded a continuous and substantial increase during November it amounted to 6 per cent for all three classes bonds industrial stocks and railroad stocks  according to the Dow Jones indices The index of bond prices rose from 7965 on November i to 84II on November 30 that of industrials from 7344 to 780I on November 28 and that of railroads from 7253 to 7666 on November 29 Only industrial stocks have shown a gain so far in December reaching 8I50 on the fifteenth Railroad stocks declined to 7420 on the same date Bond prices have fluctuated within a narrow range as is shown not only by the DowJones index for the prices of 40 bonds but also by the indices for three of the four classes specified  highest grade rails public util ities and industrials Second grade rails declined On December 22 the general index stood at 8358 The number of shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange during November was i8 per cent higher than in the preceding month So far in December the volume of trading has been well maintained while New York clearings have increased slightly BusiNEss Now that statistics reflecting business conditions are available for November it is possible to judge the ex tent of the economic improvement which we have wit nessed this fall The general indices of business activity show that the increase during the fall was less than the seasonal amount Bank clearings outside of New York City the most reliable of such indices increased 3 per cent in September 8 per cent in October and fell off 4 per cent in November as against usual increases of 3 and i6 per cent in the first two months and a decline of 2 per cent in the last The statistics for business fail ures show the same condition since the increase of such failures in October and November has been somewhat greater than usual The increase in car loadings from midsummer until the end of October was about that seasonally expected as has been the decrease since2 On the other hand building activity and the volume of manufacture for certain industries have shown a more than seasonal improvement Conspicuous among the latter are the iron and steel and paper industries The textile industries seem to be holding their own No significant improvement has appeared in the lumber and leather industries and the production of petroleum has fallen off slightly The railroad situation has been considerably clarified by the developments of the month which gave promise of prompter and more sweeping readjustments than had been generally anticipated On November I6 the Asso ciation of Railway Executives announced their plan for a temporary I0 per cent reduction in freight rates on agricultural products this reduction has recently been sanctioned by the Interstate Commerce Commission Exchange increased i8 per cent and the DowJones index of the price of 20 industrial shares rose almost 7 per cent The decline in curve B was due to a decrease in both series upon which the curve is based Bradstreets price index fell slightly from II35 on November i to II3I on December i while bank clearings outside New York City were 4 per cent less in November than October as against a usual decline of only 2 per cent The decline in curve C representing money was due to a substantial decrease in the rates on commercial paper at a time when the decrease is usually slight 1 If the 192I figures are corrected for income tax payment the September increase practically disappears while that of October becomes approximately ii instead of 8 per cent 2 During the week of July 9 a holiday week car loadings reached a mid summerminimumof 639698 cars rising to 776252 cars thenextweek They increased fairly continuously to the week of October 22 when 962698 cars were loaded dropped to 95262I the following week and numbered 78667I on the week of November I9MONTHLY SURVEY OF GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS 373 The reduction in the rates on hay and grain in western and intermountain territory originally set for Novem ber 20 wil now become effective on December 27 On December I4 hearings were begun before the Interstate Commerce Commission to determine whether and to what extent if any further reductions in rates fares and charges can lawfully be required by order or orders of the Commission    upon any commodities or de scriptions of traffic Obviously further readjustment of railroad rates involves consideration of the wage scale of the railroad employees The threatened strike was averted apparently on the understanding that the United States Railroad Labor Board would give its attention to the revision of working rules before consid ering applications for wage reductions The Board has drawn up working rules for the six shop crafts effective December i and for the maintenance of way employees effective December i6 The former include the carmen sheet metal workers machinists blacksmiths boiler makers and electricians approximately i0ooooo men at present are affected by the changes in rules for the two classes of labor The issuance of these rules paves the way for consideration of requests for changes in the wages of these men Despite apparent progress toward price stabilization shown by a decreasing number of price changes week by week one of the most potent factors in delaying business advance has been the expectation of further price re ductions Reductions in railroad rates and the antici pation of further reductions have played an important part in the uncertainty of prices Perhaps the most disturbing of price fluctuations  unconnected in this case with railroad rates  has been that in the price of cotton The phenomenal advance in August and Sep tember was followed by a somewhat irregular recession which brought the spot price of middling upland on the New York market to I67 cents per pound on November I2 A price of I89 cents was reached on the twenty third and this has not been exceeded since One reason for lower prices is found in the governmental ginning figures which show that 764I000 bales of this years crop have already passed through the gins while the October crop estimate was only 6537ooo bales On December I2 the Department of Agriculture raised its estimate to 8340ooo bales The violent fluctuation in the price of this raw material has had the effect of slowing down the distribution of cotton goods because of the uncertainty it has created as to their future price Most of the movements of the indices of commodity prices in the United States and European countries have been slight and irregular during recent months The accompanying table presents price indices for the United States and important foreign countries since May I92I The minimum figure of each series is in boldface type Prior to May there occurred an almost continuous decline from the high points reached in I920 for all the countries except Germany For the United States the decline in prices was steady from the first half of I920 the low point of the decline appears to have been reached in the three months JuneAugust There has been an advance since but it has been irregular and not large Until fall the movement of wholesale prices in most foreign countries was similar to that which occurred in the United States Canada indeed had shown an un interrupted decline of commodity prices as also had Sweden elsewhere there were evidences of approxi mate price stabilization with some tendency toward a recovery from the low points reached last spring In September however the indices for Norway and Den mark showed a substantial decline and in October recessions occurred in the United Kingdom France and the

renewal of liquidation in commodity markets reflects and tends to accentuate the slow recovery of Europe from the depression which began last year Wool consumption continues to gain The percent age of idle spindles on November i amounted to 20 per cent of the woolen spindles and 8 of the worsted a slight improvement over October i There has been a sub stantial recovery since spring in the carpet and rug looms in operation the percentage of idle loom hours on November i however was still almost onethird of the total reported In retailing readytowear gar ments special sales have appeared earlier than usual and have in many instances involved substantial price reductions The strike of the garment workers in New York continues a similar strike began in Philadelphia on November 28 and in Chicago during the same week Coincident with the unwillingness of consumers to pay the prices asked for woolen goods there has occurred a steady advance in the price of raw wool The market has been active and has even been characterized as speculative The price of fine wools has been af fected by the emergency tariff and a growing scarcity of these wools is reported At a recent auction of govern ment wool the entire amount was disposed of at price advances of from io to I5 per cent On the London market prices declined 5 to I5 per cent due it is said to lack of American buying This has acted to place the American manufacturer of wool at a disadvantage compared with the British In the iron and steel industry not only has the gain made in production during September and October been held but an advance has been recorded our adjusted index of physical production from which increases due to seasonal influences have been removed stood at 370 443 and 536 for each of the last three months The number of furnaces in blast rose from 96 on November i to I20 on December i Leaders in the industry have stated that the directly unfavorable effects of limitation of armaments on the trade would be overbalanced by the ultimate benefits to be derived Serious readjustments would doubtless be required in plants specializing in armor plate and ordnance but the tonnage of steel required for naval construction is only a fraction of one per cent of the yearly output of the in dustry as a whole Railroad buying is a promising factor on the steel market it includes rolling stock track equipment and rails Prices have felt the effect of competition arising from the desire of producers to keep up the rate of operation Those for steel as shown by the composite figure of the Iron Age reached a low for the year in the week of November 22 while pig iron prices though slightly below thze level reached at the end of September are well above the low of August Fabricated structural steel contracts during November wvere at 555 per cent of rated capacity the highest monthly percentage shown for the year Exports of iron and steel in October were slightly greater than in September though still less than onethird the amount shipped in the same month in I920 A merger of several of the independent steel companies is being contem plated Copper zinc and tin prices advanced during Novem ber Lead sales have been less than in October but the decline is not as great as is usual at this time of year Lead prices at St Louis declined slightly during Novem ber but rose during the week of December 6 to a higher level than in the preceding month There has been a fairly continuous increase in the price of wheat from the low of November 3 This has had less effect upon the prosperity of the country dis tricts because this years crop was largely marketed Buying has been restricted by the curtailed purchasing power of the farmer even in the cotton area despite the high level of prices there seems to be little increase in purchases Liquidation of bank loans in the agricul tural districts apparently stopped before substantial gains had been made and at least one more crop year will be needed to lift appreciably the load of indebted ness from farming communities The War Finance Corporation has been active in meeting the demand of farmers and stock raisers for longer time credit than that ordinarily furnished by the banks Loans made by this body from January to November exceed II9000 ooo These have been used partly to assist export trade Loans through the Stock Growers Finance Corporation to stock raisers are reported to have prevented the sale of immature cattle and the future depletion of herds The Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago states that dairy farming has felt the depression less severely than other branches of agriculture and that recovery in this line has been correspondingly more rapid Cotton exports during November were 648695 bales 26 per cent smaller than in October wheat exports fell from 308 million bushels in September to i84 in October MONEY Evidences of easier money conditions continue to come to sight The fact that large funds are seeking investment is shown by the size of subscriptions to in vestment securities of the best class The last three issues of United States treasury certificates of indebted ness amounted to iioo million dollars while the sub scriptions were over three times as large Subscriptions to the recent issue of 6 per cent refunding mortgage bonds of the New York Telephone Company were nearly ten times the amount offered  ooooooo Although the importance of such oversubscriptions is to be discounted because the bids were padded to gain advantage in the expected allotment nevertheless they show a real demand of remarkable size In the case of the telephone bonds the large number of separate sub scriptions supports this conclusion Interest rates on commercial paper have decreased during the month they are now 5 to 5 per cent Call loan rates fluctuated between 42 and 6 per cent they are now 6 per centMONTHLY SURVEY OF GENERAL BUSINESS CONDITIONS 375 COMBINED FEDERAL RESERVE BANKS In millions of

decreased up to November 30 There has been a slight expansion since August of the aggregate deposits of reporting member banks Important items of the last report of the Federal Reserve Board appear above with the same items at the time of greatest expansion and greatest contraction so far reached in I92I III STATISTICAL SUMMARY A THE SPECULATIVE GROUP New York City bank clearings in November which advanced to I6820 million dollars from I6030 millions in October exhibited a 5 per cent gain just the reverse of the 5 per cent decrease usually expected at this time of year The average price of twenty industrial stocks for Novem ber was 76oo nearly 7 per cent greater than 7I30 the average price for October The November average is not only the highest price for the past six months but it also registers the greatest percentage increase from one month to another since May I919 The average price of twenty railroad stocks on the other hand in creased only 2 per cent rising from 7250 in October to 7400 the following month Dow Jones and Companys average of the price of forty bonds made a gain of 38 per cent in November over the average price in October Increases occurred in all classes of bonds industrials showed the greatest gain 88 per cent highest and second grade rails ad vanced 54 and 47 respectively while public utility bonds increased but 28 per cent Indices for

No vember figure continues the increase which each month has shown over the preceding month since last July when the low point of the year was reached the volume of trading in November was approximately equal to the monthly average of I56ioooo shares for the first half of this year The value of building permits issued for twenty leading cities in November was 92I00000 compared with II2700000 in October a decline of I8 per cent against the smaller drop of 8 per cent ordinarily anticipated With respect to this drop however consideration must be given to the extremely large total for October to which may be attributed in part the extent of the de cline in November In fact the value figures for No vember are larger than for any November since I903 The current figure is greater by 7 per cent than the maximum for this month in I9I9 and more than ten times the minimum for November occurring a year earlier376 THE REVIEW OF ECONOMIC STATISTICS B THE BUSINESS GROUP Bank clearings of the United States outside of New York City underwent a 4 per cent drop in November declining to I3640000 million dollars from i4240000 millions the preceding month This movement is greater than the normal 2 per cent decrease which usually occurs Bradstreets index of wholesale commodity prices for December i registered a very small decrease  o3 per cent falling to II3I from the price recorded on

iron production in November showed a I3 per cent gain instead of the usual seasonal drop of 4 per cent This increase from I247000 tons in October to I4I5 ooo tons in November is the fourth consecutive month tomonth increase The November output however as was also true of the October production is the small est on record for the same month in a period of eighteen years The maximum output for almost two decades  33509000 tons  occurred in October I9I6 the cur rent figure is about 40 per cent of that amount Unfilled orders of the United States Steel Corporation on November 30 were 4250000 tons or

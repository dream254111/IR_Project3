in the minds of the profession at this juncture and is the inspiration of many treatises read at this meeting The dangers that are incident to the assembling of such a body in case it should fall under the control of untrained minds or designing partisans can best be met by a resolve on the part of the many able lawyers of the party dominant in State affairs to take part in it even at temporary inconvience bear its burdens and responsibilities and shape its course into paths of conserva tism and wisdom Apparently the subjects most prominent in the public mind if the daily prints can be trusted as an index are a restriction of the right of suffrage and a revision of the State government in the interest of economy It is the object of this paper to point out another needed reform and commend it to the thoughtful attention of any members of this Association who may be delegates to the convention We allude to the necessity of providing some checks against hasty legislation Every additional volume of sessionsacts impresses upon us the fact that we have too much lawmaking It was the old Democratic doc trine that the least government was always the best The groaning shelves of the modern law library and ponderous tomes of publications emanating from State and Federal printing houses bear mournful testi mony to the death of that doctrine of the good old days It is too easy to push a law through the legislature Even the most conscien tious hardworking member of that body strive as he may cannot keep pace with the multitudious bills introduced and we constantly find that enactments of the most farreaching character have passed both houses without being understood or even known by the vast majority of the members This fact is too notorious to require illus tration Legislation is invading domains unknown heretofore and paternalism is now the rule and not the exception The very people who have been abusing Congress for passing the vicious dependent pension bill and numerous private pension acts are doing the same thing on a smaller scale in Virginia today Our fathers fought against executive tyranny Today the executives are little more  Report of the Committee of the Virginia State Bar Association on Library and Legal Literature prepared by Robert M Hughes chairman and read before the Association at Old Point Comfort July 181900 1900 2116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER than figureheads and our children must contend with legislative tyranny Our present constitution contains but few guards against improvident legislation Section 10 of article 5 requires the three different readings but even that requirement may be suspended by a twothirds vote a proviso that practically nullifies it The new constitution should cer tainly forbid the passage of bills by unanimous consent without even reference to a committee At present it is possible and not uncommon for a member to ask unanimous consent to pass an act on his assurance of its harmlessness and his statement of its contents without reading it at all and the other members who may have a similar favor to ask any day goodnaturedly permit it The result of such a usage must be legislation crude and ambiguous in form and possibly dangerous in effect Section 15 of the same article requires a law to embrace but one object to be expressed in the title and requires amendments to be set out in full in the form of a reenactmentprovisions eminently wise and productive of much good in the past Section 20 of the same act forbids legislative divorces or special legislation in matters of which the courts have jurisdiction Section 20 of article 6 forbids special legislation for the organization and government of cities but repeals itself by permitting it when the General Assembly thinks it necessarya proviso which has made city charters the football of party politics Section 11 of article 10 contains the wellknown requirement of a recorded vote when money is being appropriated or State claims dis charged and section 16 of the same article requires tax laws to state the tax and its object distinctly and not by reference It is submitted that these sections should be made more stringent in our new organic instrument and that others be added to attain the same end Prominent among them should be some precaution against making acts go into effect from their passage The Code now says that they shall not be operative till the July following unless the act otherwise provides but this does not meet the difficulty for each legislator thinks his pet little amendment so necessary for the welfare of the human race that he always otherwise provides If the law is neces sary at all the public can usually be induced to wait till the following July for its beneficent provisions The public clamor can certainly be 212 AugLOOSE METHODS IN LEGISLATION controlled that long On the other hand the inconvenience and danger of making acts operative at once are very great County judges have told the writer of several instances where amendments of criminal statutes unknown to the courts from that cause have resulted in errors creeping into the record of criminal trials causing miscarriage of justice and heavy expense to the State If the people are presumed to know the law they are entitled to immediate information of the law A statute which goes into effect from its passage and is not pro mulgated till two or three months afterwards is practically an ex post facto law against which anathemas have so often been hurled A government which punishes its subjects for the breach of laws which they do not know and cannot know or by such means injuriously affects their property interests is as much a tyrant as the Roman Emperor who wrote his edicts on tablets in small letters and then set them so high that the people could not read them Even the favored few who secure advance sheets from legislative friends are two or three weeks late though their position is happy indeed compared to the general public which is living under those laws in blissful ignorance of their purport It is suggested that a clause in the new constitution providing that no law should go into effect till the July following its adoption unless on a recorded vote in each house and unless by a majority of all the members elected to each house would arrest or at least diminish this evil and at the same time leave sufficient latitude for passing occasional statutes that might advantageously take immediate effect A mighty cause of hurried legislation is the habit of postponing actions till the expiring days of the legislative session The legisla ture meets in December does nothing till January comparatively little then or in February and works at feverheat in March The new Acts of Assembly contain 1485 chapters Of these ten were passed in December 222 in January 435 in February and 817 in March the last one being dated March 7th The date of approval is neces sarily taken as the writer has not access to the House or Senate journal but this would not materially affect the proportion Our legislature may be a deliberative body in December or January but such a term would certainly be a misnomer during the ides of March It may be said that a good deal of time is at first devoted to elections but if necessary let the office holders and lobbyists wait and give general legislation the right of way It is suggested that a clause in the new constitution forbidding the 1900 2136 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER introduction of any bill within thirty days of the regular adjournment day or the passage of any within ten days of such adjournment would prevent this final congestion and give the governor what it is intended he should havetime to examine the statutes intelligently before act ing upon them Under present circumstances he is hardly more than a stamping machine like the one used in the postoffices to cancel stamps A favorite method of avoiding the obligation to fight improper legislation is to have the members county exempted In this way many an act that could not stand the attack of a strong speaker who saw its ills has slipped through Such legislation cannot be too severely reprobated A member of the legislature is not the mere representive of his own courthouse coterie or county Each one is a delegate of the entire commonwealth an embodiment of her sov ereignty and narrow indeed is he who does not care what may befall the State at large provided his own little county does not share the evil This is class legislation of the worst sort It silences many a voice which might be potent in defeating ill considered and uncon siered action It makes the State a patchwork of different sections living under different laws and fostering different probably conflicting interests and against it the new constitution should fulminate the most stringent prohibitions A weighty responsibility rests upon those who have undertaken the revision of the new constitution They have sown the wind and may reap the whilwind Have they loosed a demon whom they may not control or have they invoked a guardian angel to shape our future for good pregnant with the blessings of peace and prosperity  Is our new organic law to be framed by dreamers anxious to inflict all sorts of isms and crude experiments upon us to strike at vested rights and uproot institutions hallowed by centuries of successful use or will the innate conservatism and love of order and reverence for ancient land marks so long a distinguishing trait of the Old Dominion preside at the councils and guide the deliberations  The answer depends largely upon this body Let us hope that in this crisis as in all past ones constitutionmakers will spring ready armed from the fertile brain of the Commonwealth and that the allpowerful influence of the Vir ginia Bar will be a power for right and moderation 214 Aug

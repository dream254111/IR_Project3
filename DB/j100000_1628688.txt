had faded away A few minutes later another patch of the same kind of cloud also drifting east occupied about the same position as that taken by the first cloud at the time it became iridescent and this second cloud in its turn showed faint rainbow coloring This phenom enon was repeated three times and in no case did the iridescence last more than four or five minutes The colors were brightest in the second cloud There were a good many patches of cirrostratus in different portions of the sky at the time and several of them showed waves Light local showers occurred during the evening or night following Studies of iridescent clouds have been made in Europe by Ekholm Schips Mohn McCon nel Hildebrandsson Kassner and others A useful article in this subject by Arendt will be found in Das Wetter for 1897 pp 217224 and 244252 In the Jahrbuch fiir Photog raphie und Reproductionstechnik for 1900 in a brief article on the same subject by Kass ner there are some halftones of iridescent clouds The views do not of course repro duce the colors R DEC WARD HARVARD UNIVERSITY PHYSICS AND THE STUDY OF MEDICINE To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE Dr Trow bridge in his paper on The Importance of a Laboratory Course in Physics in the Study of Medicine SCIENCE May 30 1902 mentions the Johns Hopkins as one of the medical schools that do not offer a laboratory course in physics His statement is correct but the inference that might be drawn from it namely that the Johns Hopkins does not con sider such a course an important part of 33 the preparation for medicine is entirely incor rect Those who are familiar with the re quirements for medical study in this country are aware of course that from its foundation in 1893 the Johns Hopkins has required from each of its entering students certificates not only of a college course in physics but of a laboratory course as well If as frequently happens the student has not been able to get a laboratory course in the college from which he comes he is entered as conditioned in laboratory physics and is obliged to absolve this condition during his first medical year by attendance upon a course provided for such cases W H HOWELL JOIHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOL SHORTER ARTIICLES ON A METHOD IN HYGROMETRY DURING the course of my work on the dif fusion of nuclei in hydrocarbon vapors I noticed that on certain days the experiments were apt to break down the column of air within the towerlike receiver instead of show ing on exhaustion the sharp plane of demark ation between the nucleated air below and the pure air above was liable to condense as a whole almost explosively This occurred at a definite pressure and after condensation had already begun in the nucleated region Sus pecting that the discrepancy might be due to the hygrometric state of the atmosphere I made the following tests which bear out this surmise The first column shows the pressure decrement on exhaustion the second the effect produced on the nucleated atmospheric air in the dry receiver In the second and third parts of the table the results of artificially moistening and of drying the air are at once apparent 1 Room Air 2 Same Dampened 3 Same Dried

and for which suitable apparatus could be easily devised In other words artificially nucleated air is suddenly cooled by expansion until a fog just appears The dew point is computed from the pressure decrement thus determined If t be the temperature of the air in degrees centigrade and p its pressure and if the air is cooled from 200 and 76 cm we write approximately dtt27329 dpp so that roughly 1 cm of pressure decrement will correspond to a little more than one de gree of temperature decrement in a dew point apparatus and more than 10 or 15 cm of pres sure difference will rarely be required 0 BARUS BROWN UNIVERSITY PROVIDENCE R I SCLEROTINIA FRUCTIGENA AMONG the many fungi connected with plant diseases Monilia fructigena is one of the most notable Its life history has been a subject of study by many in this country and in Europe Woronin has made perhaps the most complete study and although the ascospore stage was not found he did not hesitate to place the species of the genus Sclerotinia The apo thecia have not been observed to my knowl edge by any one who has had the subject under investigation although they have been sought for by many This spring during April and Mvay I found this stage in considerable abundance in many peach and plum orchards in Maryland In fact some specimens were noticed in every or chard examined where brown rot had appeared during the year 1900 The apothecia appear with the flowers of the peach and arise from the sclerotia in the mummy fruits covered by slightly moist soil especially where they have not been disturbed for a year They are from 3 to 12 mm in diameter and the stipe is long enough to bring the disk just above the ground The apothecia dry up in a few weeks and are then very difficult to find although with a careful search they can probably now be discovered in northern peach and plum or N S VOL XVI No 392 chards A few of the ascospores retain their power of germination up to the present time By means of numerous cultures followed out very carefully on agar bouillon on sterile dried apple and prune and also on green peaches and plums I have produced the conid ial stage Monilia from the ascospores The peach petals are also easily infected with the blossom blight by placing the ascospores in contact with them It may be that the blighting of peach and plum flowers comes largely from the ascospores J B S NORTON COLLEGE PARK MD QUOTATIONS THE HOUSE OF DELEGATES OF THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THE House of Delegates of the American Medical Association was created to be the legislative assembly of the medical profes sion of the United States Its first meeting at Saratoga brought out prominently the possi bilities for effective work that are inherent in its method of organization That the work of this body at its first meeting was not per fect need hardly be said as no new machine ever made its trial trip without developing some friction However it can truthfully be said that the House of Delegates at Saratoga so performed its duties as to encourage its friends and as to quiet its critics One criticism somewhat frequently passed upon it was that its work was not deliberative Matters were referred to various committees whose report was adopted or rejected with but scant discus sion The reason for this is not far to seek The men composing the House of Delegates were the same men who for years have been endeavoring to get the old general session to legislate intelligently upon various topics that demanded elucidatiJn at the hands of the rep resentative gathering of American physicians Their experience with that method had taught every one of them that prolonged discussion meant always defeat or postponement This lesson could not be readily unlearned and so they were moved by a somewhat feverish haste to have important matters passed upon before they were killed by tiresome discussion Be

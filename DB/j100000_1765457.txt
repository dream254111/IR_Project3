Massachusetts of the visit of Mr Horace Mann and Dr Howe to the schools and that he would gladly help us of Germany and their report in favor of the oral system In his annual address to the Legislature in 1867 he said We turned to Dr Howe for help He told us that even For successive years the deafmutes of the Commonwealth children born deaf could be taught to speak and encouraged through annual appropriations have been placed for in us to talk to our little girl and to teach her to recognize the struction and training in the asylum at Hartford While in spoken words of our lips He warned us not to use nor to the treatment of these unfortunates science was at fault and allow any signs and never to understand them Cheered methods were crude in the absence of local provisions this

explored the hidden ways Gradually light dawned The child began to recall words and developed the mysterious laws by which the recesses of forgotten in her long illness and to add new words to her

convinced that her progress and intelligence were equal from their birth How identified Miss Rogers has been to that of most hearing children of the same age and gave with the whole work from the very beginning how much of us our charter At one of these hearings our little girl saw its success is due to her earnestness and entire devotion we forthe first time the deafmutes signs and asked why deaf

system and with tears in his eyes asked if his little daughter could ever be taught to speak In a year he heard from her lips the words  father  and mother Miss Rogers removed with her little school to Northamp ton and became iis principal Thus the first school for teaching articulation lipreading and oral instruction was established in this country A member of the committee from Boston also a meilber of the school committee of Boston took an especial interest in the hearing He attended every meeting and visited our little school at Chelmsford called repeatedly to see our daughter and aided us by every means in his power to ob tain our charter having first inserted a provision giving us the right to establish schools in two other suitable places besides Northampton The name of that gentleman was Dexter S King His interest in the education of deaf chil dren instead of ceasing with the granting of our charter increased Scarcely was our school opened when he asked that a branch might be started in Boston This we were unable to do Mr King as a member of the school board secured the appointment of a committee to consider this subject in 1868 and 1879 The city was canvassed Fifty deaf children were found of whom only twentytwo were in school Twentyeight were at home with no one able to render them aid in their search for an education The committee estab lished this school by the name of  The School for Deaf Mutes It was on Nov 10 1869 in a room in the old schoolhouse in East Street with nine pupils In one week an afternoon session had opened for eleven other pupils in the schoolhouse on Somerset Street In January 1870 it moved into suitable quarters on Pemberton Square where it remained for several years When Mr King retired from the school committee of the city of Boston in 1871 a series of resolutions were passed that to him was mainly due the project of establishing in this city a public school for deafmutes the first institution of the kind in Americaand expressing the thanks of the board for his valuable services For the remaining years of his life he was almost a daily visitor at the school In the year 1873 the name of the school was changed to The Horace Mann School A principal was necessary who could not only instruct the deaf but could supervise all the interests of the school se curing both the affection of the pupils and the confidence and respect of the school committee To Miss Fuller this school and the deaf children of America owe a debt of grati tude that can never be repaid A few years later an English gentleman Mr B St John Ackers visited the various schools of England and America seeking for the best means of educating his own deaf child He decided that she should be taught by articulation rather than by signs which was the system then used in the Eng lish institution He was so much pleased with this school that he engaged one of its teachers Miss Barton to return with him More and more convinced of the superiority of articulation teaching and feeling the importance of thorough and earnest teachers he was led to establish a normal school which has sent out many teachers well fitted for their work Subsequently Mr Ackers then a member of Parliament was influential in securing the appointment of a royal commis sion to investigate and report upon the condition of the blind the deaf and the dumb of the United Kingdom and was appointed one of the commission by the Queen Mr Gallaudet and Professor Bell were invited to be present dNCE 336 as representing the two systems in use in this country Mr Bell gave a full account of the Horace Mann School and its work in which he has always felt the deepest interest In their report the commission recommend that every child who is deaf should have full opportunity of education in the oral system that all children should be for the first year at least instructed in the oral system and after the first year they should be taught to speak and lipread on the oral sys tem unless they are physically deficient that children who have partial hearing should in all cases be instructed in the pure oral system that trained teachers of the deaf should as in Germany receive salaries such as would induce teach ers of special attainments to enter the profession and on a higher scale than those enjoyed by trained teachers of ordi nary children In England as well as in our own country the influence of our work has been felt The year before the Clarke In stitution was opened there were only 119 deaf children from the State at school Now there are 312 an increase of 160 per cent while our population has increased only 50 per cent Massachusetts has therefore more than three times as many pupils today in proportion to population as it had twenty years ago Starting from Massachusetts as a centre public interest was everywhere excited by the deaf New institutions and dayschools were established in different parts of the country In many of these the oral system alone was used In all teachers of articulation were em ployed and articulation and lip reading made a part of their daily instruction The number of pupils has increased from 3246 in 1870 to 8575 in 1890 and in proportion to popula tion the ratio of increase equals that of our own State three to one Who can doubt but that this is due to the influence of the Clarke and Horace Mann Schools and to the general interest they have awakened in the education of the deaf  Institutions for the deaf are undoubtedly necessary in every State as children must be gathered from distant points but wherever there are in cities a sufficient number of chil dren dayschools are certainly to be preferred The home influence the strong ties of affection are often more impor tant to the deaf child than to the hearing for he is less pre pared to fight the battle of life The success of the Horace Mann School has led to the opening of dayschools in Port land Providence Cincinnati Milwaukee Chicago St Louis Evansville New Orleans and La Crosse Let us liere pause for a moment to pay a tribute of respect to the memory of one of the first and best teachers of this school Early in its history Miss Bond became interested in it and gave to it her time her sympathies and her earnest labors For years her efforts for its progress were unwearied and even in failing health and extreme physical suffering the welfare of the school was ever in her mind When we consider that the interest in deafmute educa tion which formed the Royal Ccmmission and the recom mendations which have so changed the system of education in Great Britain is a direct growth from our work have we not reason to believe that the seed sown in our weakness has already borne much fruit and will yield a still more abun dant harvest  Believing that for the deaf our system lessens their priva tions brings them more into communic ttion with their friends and fellows and instead of building up still higher the sepa rating wall of a different language opens to them as to others the treasures of written language shall we not rejoice that340 UClEk it has been our privilege to work together for this end and that out of the affliction of a little child a blessing has come to so many  The success of our schools in which we rejoice today is due not only to the superiority of the oral system over the signlanguage system not only to the energy and persever ance of their founders but more than all to the devotion to the untiring zeal and to the ability of our teachers No other teaching is so exacting requires such constant attention and unwearied application The names of all are too numerous to mention In our earthly as in our heavenly firmanent one star differeth from another in glory but bright as constellations shine the names of Miss Rogers Miss Fuller and Miss Bond This school is appropriately named the Horace Mann School since Mr Mann was the first to recommend the adoption of the oral system but it was to Mr King that this school owes its existence The names of those who laid the foundation and built the edifice should not be for gotten But it is to Mr King that this school owes its existence A bronze tablet should be affixed to its walls and associated with the name of Horace Mann should be the names of Dexter S King and Sarah Fuller inscribed thereon that thus the names of the three who have done so much for the edu cation of the deaf may be perpetuated THE MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECH NOLOGY1 AN institution of learning may make a demand upon pub lic recognition and gratitude because of its good work in training successive classes of young men for usefulness in life even though it be not an innovator in education and uses only the old and familiar methods of instruction but it may acquire a further and larger claim by becoming a leader in its department by introducing new methods and open ing the way to a better kind of intellectual and professional training How the Institute of Technology has dealt with the thou sands of young men who have been its pupils since 1865 what it aas done for them what places they now occupy in the industrial system what services they have rendered to the arts and industries of the country common fame will tell Those who would study this matter more carefully will find material in the lists of its graduates and of the places they fill as told in the annual catalogues But in addition to its work in training a certain number of young men for the duties of life the Institute of Technology has been preeminently a leader in education Its influence has not been confined to what it has done for its own pupils but has extended as far as its example of advanced scientific and technical instruction has gone Almost at the very outset a long step forward was taken in the establishment of a laboratory of general chemistry Up to that time general chemistry had been taught wholly by means of textbooks or by lectures with experiments by the lecturer The students part was only to look and to listen and learn in this way what he could It was not until the student was put into the analytical laboratory and took the retort into his own hand that he did or discovered any thing for himself Under the inspiration of Professor Rogers and the enterprise and administrative skill of Pro 1 From the Commemorative Address by Augustus Lowell Esq at the twentytfth anniversaryof the aassachusetts Institute of Technology NCE VOL XVI No 411 fessor Charles W Eliot and Professor Frank H Storer a laboratory of general chemistry was established and the pupil from the first day of his chemical studies was set to teach himself This was no analytical laboratory It was simply designed as a means of illustrating emphasizing and supplementing the instruction of the lectureroom in regard to the nature of chemical action and the characteristics of the principal elements The student was not told what he slould find He was told to do something and note what occurred He was thrown upon his own faculties of obser vation and reflection He learned to know himself and to measure his own power and he acquired ease and accuracy of manipulation by practice So far as known this was the first laboratory of such a character set up in the world Cer tainly it was the first one instituted in the United States for the instruction of considerable classes of pupils The publi cation of Eliot and Storers Manual designed for students taking this course marked an epoch in the history of educa tion Another equally important step in scientific education and one of which the originality is beyond doubt was taken at about this time in the establishment of a laboratory now known as the Rogers Laboratory of Physics Under the inspiration of President Rogers the scheme of a laboratory where the student of physics should be set to make observa tions and conduct measurements for himself in demonstra tion and illustration of the physical laws taught in the lectureroom was carried out with remarkable ability on both the scientific and administrative sides by Professor Edward C Pickering now director of the Harvard Observa tory So complete was Professor Pickerings study of the needs and capabilities of such a laboratory so masterly his treatment of it that it has required only more room and additional apparatus to allow the system he then de vised and formulated to be extended successively to classes of fifty of one hundred and even of one hundred and fifty students In the school year of 187172 another forward step in edu cation was taken at the Institute of Technology Down to that time the instruction in mining engineering and metal lurgy had been here as elsewhere conducted by means of textbooks lectures drawing models and assays of small pinches of ore supplemented in the case of the more fortu nately situated schools by occasional visits to mines in actual operation In the year named a scientific expedition to the Rocky Mountains was undertaken by a large party of stu dents and instructors from the institute While in the Colo rado mining regions Professor Runkle conceived the idea of a laboratory which should add to the existing means of instruction in mining and metallurgy the practical treatment by the students of economic quantities of ores This con ception so fully in the line of the general work of the insti tute was given effect by the purchase in California before the return of the expedition of a number of pieces of apparatus suitable for the beginnings of such a laboratory The appa ratus thus obtained was set up by Mr Robert H Richards then instructor and now for many years professor of mining engineering From these small beginnings made under Professor Richardss care it has grown steadily to this day It was the first proper metallurgical laboratory devoted to the pur poses of instruction in the world It is under its title The John Cummings Laboratory by far the largest and the best in the world today Its graduates are found in the most important mines and smelting and reductiQn works of the I  It

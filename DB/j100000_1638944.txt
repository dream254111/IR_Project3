Empire Exhibi tion Association is promoting on a wide scale an exhibition of the national resources of the empire which will be opened at the beginning of next year in a handsome building to be erected on the Aldwych site where the exist ing offices of the institute are situated The purpose of the exhibition is to demonstrate to the public as well as to manufacturers and in dustrialists the potentialities of the empire as contained in its natural resources The various dominions and colonies are coopera ting in the scheme and each colony will with the advice of the central body organize its own particular section of the exhibition The cost of the project will be about 50000 which has been provided for through the generosity of the directors of the institute The exhibi tion will it is expected remain open during the whole of next year UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS THE Medical College of the University of Cincinnati has received several large dona tions during the past month Mrs Mary M Emery promised the university the sum of 250000 for a new Medical College Building on the condition that an additional 250000 be raised by July I for its equipment and mainte nance At the appointed time Dean C R Holmes of the College of Medicine an nounced that 250000 had been secured The new structure will be located on grounds ad jacent to those of the Cincinnati General Hos pital which occupies 24 buildings and covers 27 acres and which offers unusual opportu nities for clinical instruction The sum of 30000 has just been raised by citizens of Cin cinnati for the purpose of maintaining for three years a chair of medicine in the Medical College The chair will be known as the Frederick Forchheimer chair of medicine in honor of the late Dr Frederick Forchheimer who was for years professor of medicine at the Medical College Dr Robert S Morris lately of Clifton Springs New York and formerly of Ann Arbor and of Johns Hopkins Univer sity has been appointed to the new position ON June 8 during the commencement week at De Pauw University the corner stone of the new Bowman Memorial Gymnasium was laid with appropriate ceremonies The building will cost over 100000 THE new Honan Biological Institute at Uni versity College Cork has been completed as we learn from the British Medical Journal owing to the generosity of the trustees of the estate of the late Miss Honan and forms a handsome group of buildings situated near the plant houses which were the gift of the late William Crawford of Lakelands The bio logical laboratory was a small building much too cramped for the teaching of the students much less for the research work which has al ways been a feature of the college In the new building ample room has been provided for the study of zoology botany and geology There are junior and senior zoological and botanical laboratories as well as research rooms geolog ical and geographical laboratories and a large semicircular lecture theater lit from the roof and capable of accommodating about 100 stu dents THE summer session of the University of California for 1915 by June 30 nine days after the beginning of the sixweeks term had en rolled 5420 students which was more than 2000 more than on a corresponding date the year before and which was only 52 less than the largest total registration at any one time in the academic colleges and graduate school for the fall or spring sessions excluding students in the professional colleges AMONG instructors appointed at the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology are Barnum B Libby and George Rutledge

THE MERIDIONAL DEVIATION OF A FALLING BODY Introductory RemarlcsVarious definitions have been given for the meridional deviation of a falling body and various potential func tions have been assumed in the mathematical determination thereof It is therefore per fectly natural that the results found by differ ent writers on the subject do not agree How ever when once the equations of motion of the falling body the definition of the devia tion and the potential function have been fixed the solution of the problem is unique 1 Transactions of the American Mathematical So ciety Vol XII pp 33563 ibid Vol XIII pp 46990 In 19111 I published a general formula for the meridional deviation which included as special cases the apparently discordant for mulee of several other writers This was pos sible because my formula could be broken up into parts which corresponded to different kinds of meridional deviation and also because it was expressed in terms of the symbol repre senting the potential function which symbol when replaced by particular forms of this function made it yield the results of the writers who had used these particular forms In 19132 Dr R S Woodward treated the problem using the equations of motion the definition of the deviation and one of the potential functions which I had used Therefore he should have ob tained the result which I did for that potential function provided my solution was correct But he got a different result This lack of agreement was the means of interesting Pro fessor F R Moulton in the problem In June 1914 Professor Moulton published an article3 in which he solved the problem treated by Dr Woodward and his result was the same as mine Shortly after the appearance of Pro fessor Moultons article I published a paper4 which however was prepared at the same time as Professor Moultons and independently of it showing that Dr Woodwards methods when applied to his initial assumptions should lead to my results In reply to Professor Moultons article and my last paper Dr Woodward has just published a note5 in which he states that he did not solve the problem which Professor Moulton and I had solved The present article is my reply to this note Granting that  two different problems have actually been solved I will show that this is so because Dr Woodward has not solved the 2 Astronomical Journal Nos 65152 August 4 1913

monograph on pneumothorax by Dr Emmerson covering 450 pages The literature of the subject go ing back to the works of Hippocrates and coming down to the present time is given in the form of abstracts translations or quota tions from the original articles This neces sitates much more space than is usually de voted to literature but it must be admitted that in many respects it is more satisfactory than the references ordinarily made The first chapter is devoted wholly to these abstracts In Chapter II entitled The History of Pneumothorax the facts stated in the ab stracts already given are satisfactorily woven together Chapter III is devoted to the etiology and pathology of the disease with clinical histories of cases While there is much of interest in this chapter it can not be said that it contains any important contri bution to our knowledge of the disease Chap ter IV on The Mechanism of Pneumo thorax is in our opinion the most interest ing and in some respects the most valuable part of this monograph Your reviewer has been especially interested in the work done by Dr Emmerson as well as the literature which he has collected bearing upon the composition of the gas accumulation in the chest in this disease Ilis conclusions are stated as fol lows SCIENCE 785786 SCIENCE 1 There is a rapid accumulation of CO2 in the pleurae after death which fact rules out the majority of analyses yet published 2 The presence of a purulent exudate is an important element in determining the com position of the gas  3 This postmortem accumulation of CO2 may explain the high tension of the gas which hisses from the chest on the autopsy table 4 The method of diagnosing an open fistula proposed by Leconte and Demarquay seems to be valid Preceding authors have largely if not alto gether failed to recognize the fact that the composition of the gas found in the pleura in pneumothorax is in part at least dependent upon the character of the microorganisms con tained in the accompanying exudate We know that certain bacteria consume oxygen and give off carbonic acid gas while still others break up proteid material and elaborate H2S and possibly NH42S It is not there fore surprising that there has been much diversity of statement concerning the composi tion of the gas in pneumothorax Our author certainly makes it clear that these variations are to be expected The second paper is entitled Clinical Ob servations on Blood Pressure This is always an interesting subject to both the physiologist and the clinician The instrument used in these observations was a modified RivaRocci sphygmomanometer which gives very satisfac tory results The experiments made upon the effects of anesthesia upon blood pressure con firm the views now quite universally held by the best surgeons in this country that is that chloroform on account of its depressing ac tion and the consequent low blood pressure is a much more dangerous anesthetic for surgical operations than ether The authors of this paper Cook and Briggs bring out the fact so well known to obstetricians that the de pressing action of chloroform is not manifest when this anesthetic is used in labor The most interesting part of this paper to your reviewer at least is that which deals with the effects of strychnin and digitalin in cases of shock Most clinicians of wide experience N S VOL XVIII No 468 have become very positively convinced that strychnin especially is valuable in shock but this has recently been denied by Crile whose most interesting and valuable work upon this subject demands respect Crile holds that the employment of strychnin in shock is irrational because according to him in this condition the vasomotor center is completely exhausted and no good is to be secured by flogging the tired horse to death Notwithstanding the conclusion reached by Crile the majority of clinicians think that they have had in their experience ample and frequently repeated evi dence of the value of strychnin in shock and it is gratifying to know that Cook and Briggs in the paper now under review have shown that in eight out of ten cases of shock under central stimulation with strychnin digitalin or cocain positive improvement has been secured It is only fair to state that this difference between Crile and other clinicians is largely a matter of words Crile recognizes as shock only those cases in which strychnin does no good and he designates by the term collapse other cases in which central stimu lation is of value but inasmuch as no one not even the operator himself can distinguish between the two in many instances the clinician will undoubtedly continue to use strychnin in shock and in doing this will be justified by the experimental observations recorded in the article now under considera tion The third paper in this volume is entitled The Value of Tuberculin in Surgical Diag nosis and is presented by Dr Tinker While this article is of value inasmuch as it con firms the findings of a number of others who have investigated the subject it can not be said to furnish us with anything new The author concludes that tuberculin properly em ployed is a valuable agent and we may say the most valuable agent in our possession in the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis and is harmless V C VAUGHAN SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS AND ARTICLES The Psychological Review will hereafter be edited

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012929, COPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS ,I242648,COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS BY GILBERT H MONTAGUE COUNSELLOR AT LAW NEW YORK THE LAST PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN AMONG ITS OTHER BLESSINGS ENRICHED THE POPULAR VOCABULARY OF ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL DISCUS SION WITH THE WORD CO6PERATION ONE STEP AWAY FROM COMBINA TION AND MORE ALTRUISTIC IN SOUND THAN COMPETITION CO6PERATION SERVED WELL AS A POLITICAL RALLYING CRY THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN AND HAS SINCE DONE YEOMANS SERVICE IN RALLYING BUSINESS MEN TO COLLECTIVE ACTION REGARDING PRICES TERRITORY AND OTHER THORNY TRADE CONDITIONS UNPLEASANTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHERMAN ANTITRUST LAW AROUND CO6PERATION A LITERATURE HAS DEVELOPED UPON IT HAS SPRUNG UP A CULT AND BEFORE IT IN THE HOPES OF ITS DEVOTEES LIES A FUTURE OF USEFULNESS IN WHICH CO6PERATING TRADE ASSOCIATIONS SHALL WALK ARM AND ARM WITH THE NEWLY ESTABLISHED FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND FIND LASTING PEACE AND REST FROM THE SHERMAN LAW THE RADICAL CHANGE THAT IS TAKING PLACE IN THE COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL WORLDTHE CHANGE FROM A COMPETITIVE TO A CO6PERATIVE BASIS IS THE PROGRAM OF THIS CO6PERATIVE MOVEMENT  CO6PERATION IS ESSENTIALLY CONSTRUCTIVE COMPETITION DESTRUCTIVE IS ITS CREED HOSTILITY TO THE SHERMAN LAW IS ITS CONTROLLING HABIT THE VERY THEORY OF OUR ANTITRUST LAWS ASSERTS THE CO6PERATIONIST WITH A WEALTH OF ITALICS IS THAT THEY SUPPRESS COOPERATION AND BY ENCOURAGING COMPETITION PROMOTE THE WIDEST FLUCTUATIONS IN PRICES  THE SHERMAN LAW IS DESTRUCTIVE IN PUR POSE AND APPLICATION STATE ANTITRUST ACTS ARE FRAMED TO TEAR DOWN AND DESTROY THE MUCH VAUNTED SHERMAN LAW WILL PASS INTO ECONOMIC HISTORY ALONG WITH SUCH ENGLISH LAWS AS THOSE AGAINST REGRATING FORESTALLING AND ENGROSSING AND LAWS AGAINST LABOR UNIONSAS ONE OF MANS FUTILE ATTEMPTS TO CHECK EVOLUTION  THE COUNTRY HAS REACHED THE PARTING OF THE WAYS IT MUST MAKE ITS CHOICE AND MAKE IT INTELLIGENTLYEITHER THE COMPETITIVE OR THE COOPERATIVE BASIS 1 THESE AND OTHER QUOTATIONS AND REFERENCES TO COOPERATION THAT FOLLOW ARE FROM ARTHUR J EDDY THE NEW COMPETITION A C MCCLURG  CO CHICAGO 1915 COOPERATION IN THE SENSE INTENDED BY MR EDDY AND OTHERS OF HIS SCHOOL IS THE CO6PERATION WITH WHICH THIS ARTICLE DEALS 69THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PRICES ARE THE FIRST CONCERN OF THE COOPERATIONIST CO6PERATION WHETHER VOLUNTARY OR INVOLUNTARYCOMPELLED BY LAWIS THE ONLY REGULATOR OF PRICES COMPETITION FREE AND UNFETTERED IS ABSOLUTELY DESTRUCTIVE TO ALL STABILITY OF PRICES FOR THIS THE CO6PERATIONISTS REMEDY IS EASY ASSOCIATIONS OF COMPETING MANUFACTURERS AND DEAL ERS TO LESSEN COMPETITION AND ADVANCE PRICES THIS HOWEVER IS CLUMSILY ANTICIPATING THE SECRET THE CAREFUL CO6PERATIONIST IN EXPOUNDING THE NEW DISPENSA TION GENERALLY PICKS HIS WORDS WITH GREATER CAUTION FOR IN THE PRES ENT UNCERTAIN STATE OF THE LAW THE ATTITUDE OF CONGRESS WOULD SEEM TO BE THAT OF FORBIDDING THE VOLUNTARY ASSOCIATION THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE BRUTAL FEATURES OF COMPETITION FRANK INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION THEREFORE IS THE ORTHODOX DESCRIPTION OF THE BUSINESS OF SUCH AN ASSOCIATION SPECIFICALLY THE MEMBERS OF THE COOPERATING ASSOCIATION ARE SUPPOSED TO DISCLOSE AND DISCUSS FREELY 1 EVERY ELEMENT THAT ENTERS INTO THE COST OF THEIR WORK 2 WORK IN HAND THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH IT IS BEING DONE 3 WORK IN PROSPECT ALL REQUESTS FOR BIDS WITH FRANK INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION REGARDING SUCH PROPOSED WORK AND THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH IT MUST BE DONE 4 ALL BIDS ACT UALLY MADE ON WORK 5 CONDITIONS AFFECTING THEIR GENERAL WEL FARE SO LONG ADDS THE CAUTIOUS CO6PERATIONIST AS ITS MEMBERS ENTER INTO NO AGREEMENT TO FIX PRICES OR CONTROL COMPETITION THE LEGALITY OF SUCH AN ASSOCIATION COULD HARDLY BE QUESTIONED PROBABLY NOT BUT HOW FAR REMOVED FROM FIXING PRICES AND CONTROLLING COMPETITION IS THE RESULT OF SUCH A CO6PERATING ASSOCIATION THE EFFECT OF COMPETITION UNDER SUCH OPEN AND STRAIGHT FORWARD CONDITIONS CONTINUES THE CO6PERATIONIST WOULD BE STABILITY OF PRICES AT NORMAL LEVELS PRICES WOULD VARY BUT THEY WOULD NOT VARY WIDELY THIS SIGNIFICANT ACHIEVEMENT OF THE CO6PERATING ASSOCIATION IS EMPHASIZED AGAIN AND AGAIN PRICES AND PROFITS WILL TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES THEY WILL BE NORMAL AND REASONABLY CONSTANT   PRICES ARE NOT FIXED IN THE ACTIVE SENSE OF THE VERB BUT THEY BECOME STABLE AS THE RESULT OF NORMAL CONDITIONS THE MORE OPEN THE PRICE THE STRONGER THE TENDENCY TOWARD STABILITY NOT THAT OPEN PRICES ALONE CAN ACCOMPLISH THIS STABILITY THE OPEN PRICE POLICY MEANS NOT ONLY OPEN PRICES BUT OPEN DIS 70COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS CUSSIONS REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE CUTS HERE AT LAST WE FIND THE MILK IN THE COCOANUT HOW SHALL OPEN DISCUSSIONS REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CUTS BE HAD WITHOUT INFLUENCING PRICES IN VIOLATION OF THE HATED SHERMAN LAW THE DIFFICULTIES OF THE COOPERATIONIST ARE OBVIOUS A NEVER CEASING EMBARRASSMENT IS THE POVERTY OF THE ENGLISH LAN GUAGE EUPHEMISMS FOR LESSENING COMPETITION AND ADVANC ING PRICES ARE ALL TOO RARE STABILITY OF PRICES FRIENDLY COMPETITION CAREFUL BIDDING NORMAL PRICE LEVELS REASONABLY CONSTANT PRICES INTELLIGENT COMPETITION REGULATION AND ELIMINATION OF BRUTAL COMPETITION ARE ALL MORE PLEASING THAN THEIR INFELICITOUS SYNONYMS LESSENING COMPETITION AND ADVANCING PRICES PLAIN BUSINESS MEN HOWEVER ARE UNFORTUNATELY PRONE TO STUMBLE AT SUCH VERBAL CONCEALMENTS OF THOUGHT IT REQUIRES TIME LAMENTS THE SORETRIED COOPERATIONIST TO ERADICATE TRACES OF HABITS WHICH HAVE BECOME SECOND NATURE HABITS OF THOUGHT OF SPEECH OF CONDUCT EVEN WHEN MEN ARE HONESTLY TRYING TO THINK ALONG THE NEW LINES THEY WILL TALK AND CORRESPOND ALONG THE OLD THE OLD PHRASES WILL CROP OUT AND THEIR LETTERS WILL BRISTLE WITH LANGUAGE THAT HERETOFORE HAS BEEN USED ONLY IN FIXING PRICES AND SUPPRESSING COMPETITION ALAS IT IS ALL TOO TRUE SO IT HAPPENS THAT THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION THE ONLY APPROVED INSTRUMENT OF THE ORTHODOX CO6PERATIONIST IS ALWAYS A DELICATE MATTER AT THE OUTSET HE EXPLAINS THEY MUST BE MADE TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE MEETING IS NOT CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ENTERING INTO ANY AGREEMENT ALONG OLD LINES IT IS NOT CALLED FOR THE PURPOSE OF FIXING PRICES ALLOTTING BUSINESS CONTROLLING COMPETITION RESTRAINING TRADE OR CREAT ING A MONOPOLY THERE IS NO INTENTION OF DOING ANY OF THESE THINGS EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BUT HERE THE SKELETON INTRUDES AT THE FEAST IN ORDER TO AVOID MISUNDERSTANDINGS BY MEMBERS BY CUSTOMERS BY THE PUBLIC IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE CONSTITUTION AND BYLAWS BE CAREFULLY DRAWN SO AS TO EXPRESS IN FULL THE PURPOSES OF THE ASSOCIATION AND EVERY AGREEMENT UNDERLYING ITS ORGANIZATION THIS IS ADVISABLE EVERYWHERE IT IS DOUBLY ADVISABLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHERE THE LAW REGARDING RESTRAINT OF TRADE IS SO STRICT AND THE PUBLIC SO SUS PICIOUS   THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS MUST BE SO FRAMED THAT EVEN A JUDGE NOT VERSED IN BUSINESS WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THE PLAN AND LEST THE THRIFTY BUSINESS MAN FAIL TO SEE THE NECESSITY OF ALWAYS EMPLOYING AN ORTHODOX COOPERATION LAWYER THE CO6PERATION 71THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IST GLOOMILY CITES UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS AT CO6PERATION MADE WITHOUT COUNSEL AND SO FOREDOOMED TO FAILURE AFTER THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION IS ORGANIZED COME THE MEET INGS THEY SHOULD BE HELD IT APPEARS EVERY MONTH OR SO PRI MARILY THEY ARE DEVOTED TO DISCUSSIONS OF COMPLAINTS AND QUESTIONS BY EACH OF THE MEMBERS REGARDING WORK TAKEN DURING THE PRE CEDING MONTH BY THE MEMBER UNDER FIRE TO PUT A MEMBER UN DER FIRE HOWEVER WITHOUT SOMEHOW INFLUENCING HIS CONDUCT IN VIOLATION OF THE SHERMAN LAW IS NOT A JOB FOR UNAIDED BUSINESS MEN THIS MEANS OF COURSE MORE WORK FOR THE CO6PERATION LAWYER AT EVERY MEETING HIS SERVICES ARE NEEDED TO STEER THE DISCUSSION SAFELY WITHIN THE EUPHEMISTIC VOCABULARY OF CO6PERATION AND TO CHECK ANY UNFORTUNATE LAPSES OF THE LAYMEMBERS INTO THE LANGUAGE OF PLAIN SPEECH AND HERE THE CAUTIONS OF THE CO6PERATIONIST BECOME EXTRAORDINARY DO NOTHING HE COMMANDS YOU ARE AFRAID TO RECORD RECORD EVERYTHING YOU DO AND KEEP YOUR RECORDS WHERE ANY PUBLIC OFFICIAL IN THE PERFORMANCE OF HIS DUTIES MAY HAVE EASY ACCESS TO THEM IN SHORT PRESERVE SO CAREFULLY ALL EVIDENCE REGARDING INTENTIONS ACTS AND RESULTS THAT THERE WILL BE NO ROOM FOR INFERENCE OR ARGUMENT THAT ANYTHING ELSE WAS INTENDED DONE OR ACHIEVED CERTAINLY THERE IS NEED FOR CAUTION COLLECTIVE ACTION TO INFLU ENCE PRICES HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN ATTEMPTED DURING THE PAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND OFTEN UNDER WHAT APPEARED THE MOST EXCUSABLE CIRCUMSTANCES WRECKS OF ASSOCIATIONS AND COMBINATIONS HOWEVER OF EVERY KIND AND DESCRIPTION THAT HAVE RUN FOUL OF THE SHERMAN LAW MERELY BECAUSE THEY HAVE TRIED TO STABILIZE PRICES MAY BE FOUND IN ALMOST EVERY STATE OF THE UNION ASSOCIATIONS AND COMBINATIONS OF COAL OPERATORS COAL DEALERS RAILROADS PIPE MANUFACTURERS MEAT PACKERS SALT MANUFACTURERS WHOLESALE GROCERS PAPER MANUFAC TURERS ELEVATOR MANUFACTURERS LUMBER DEALERS RETAIL DRUGGISTS FURNITURE MANUFACTURERS UMBRELLA MANUFACTURERS POWDER MANUFAC TURERS STATIONERY

MANUFACTURERS FLOUR MANUFACTURERS COASTER BRAKE MANUFACTURERS STEAMSHIP OPERATORS WHARF OPERATORS FRUIT DEALERS SHOELAST MANUFACTURERS AND BREAKFAST FOOD MANUFAC TURERS HAVE ALL BEEN SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTED UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW IN MORE THAN A SCORE OF INSTANCES CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS RESULTING IN 72COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS THE IMPOSITION OF OVER A HALF MILLION DOLLARS IN FINES HAVE BEEN CON CLUDED NOR IS THIS THE END THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE NOW HAS PENDING SUITS AGAINST VARIOUS ASSOCIATIONS AND COMBINATIONS OF MEAT PACKERS TURPENTINE MANUFACTURERS COAL OPERATORS PAPER MANU FACTURERS RAILROADS STEAMSHIP OPERATORS BILL POSTERS FILM MANU FACTURERS HORSESHOE MANUFACTURERS AND BUTTER AND EGG DEALERS BEFORE THIS DISPLAY OF JUDICIAL AND GOVERNMENTAL DISFAVORWHICH IS STILL UNABATED AND QUITE UNAFFECTED BY THE RECENT TURN IN JUDICIAL GOVERNMENTAL AND POPULAR FEELING THAT HAS TOUCHED OTHER PHASES OF THE TRUST PROBLEMTHE CO6PERATIONIST HAS GOOD REASON TO BE CAU TIOUS HOW DOES HE EXPECT TO ESCAPE THE FATE OF HIS PREDECESSORS HE EXPLAINS HIS THEORY HIMSELF IT IS ONE THING HE SAYS FOR MEN IN A MEETING TO SAY ONE AFTER ANOTHER MY PRICE IS SO AND SO WITH THE RESULT THAT AFTER THE MEETING ALL THEIR PRICES PROVE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE FIGURES MENTIONED IT IS QUITE A DIFFERENT THING FOR THE SAME MEN TO COME TO A MEETING AND EACH REPORT MY ACTUAL SALES FOR THE PAST MONTH HAVE BEEN SO AND SO AND HERE ARE THE DETAILS OF EACH TRANSACTION IN THAT STATEMENT THERE IS NO DIRECT OR IMPLIED AGREEMENT TO MAINTAIN PRICES NO OBLIGATION OF ANY KIND TO REFRAIN FROM CUTTING  WHEN MEN MEET AND EACH SAYS MY PRICE IS SO AND SO AND ALL SAY THE SAME A PROMISE TO MAINTAIN THAT PRICE MAY PER HAPS BE INFERRED FROM SUBSEQUENT EVENTS BUT NO SUCH PROMISE CAN BE INFERRED FROM FRANK STATEMENTS OF PAST TRANSACTIONS AND YET MORE IN THE WAY OF STABILITY OF PRICES WILL RESULT FROM THE MERE INTERCHANGE OF INFORMATION THAN FROM AN AGREE MENT TO MAINTAIN PRICES  KNOWLEDGE REGARDING BIDS AND PRICES ACTUALLY MADE IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP PRICES AT REASONABLY STABLE AND NORMAL LEVELS NO AGREEMENTS TO MAINTAIN PRICES ARE NECESSARY EVERYTHING IN CO6PERATION IS SO SIMPLE STABILITY OF PRICES AND PRICES AT REASONABLY STABLE AND NORMAL LEVELSTHE AIM OF EVERY ASSOCIATION AND COMBINATION EVER PROSECUTED AND BROKEN UP BY THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THE RESULT SOUGHT BY EVERY WELL MEANING BUSINESS MAN WHOM THE COURTS HAVE EVER CONVICTED AND FINED UNDER THE SHERMAN LAWMIGHT ALL HAVE BEEN SO EASILY AND SAFELY ACCOMPLISHED SIMPLY BY SAYING MY PRICE HAS BEEN SO AND SO INSTEAD OF MY PRICE IS SO AND SO BUT IS IT REALLY SO SIMPLE AND EASY THE SUPREME COURT HAS REPEATEDLY HELD THE SHERMAN LAW TO EMBRACE EVERY CONCEIVABLE ACT WHICH COULD POSSIBLY COME WITHIN THE SPIRIT AND PURPOSE OF THE LAW WITHOUT REGARD TO THE GARB IN WHICH SUCH ACTS ARE CLOTHED WITH ABSOLUTELY NO POSSIBILITY OF FRUSTRATING THAT POLICY BY RE 73THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SORTING TO ANY DISGUISE OR SUBTERFUGE OF FORM NOR YET TO ESCAPE BY ANY INDIRECTION THE PROHIBITIONS OF THE STATUTE IF NOW COOPERATION IS A GARB THAT PROTECTS AS WELL AS CLOTHES IF INDEED THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION IS A FORM THAT FRUSTRATES THE POLICY OF THE SHERMAN LAW AND IF THE MAGICAL PHRASE MY PRICE HAS BEEN SO AND SO IS A SPELL THAT REALLY KEEPS AWAY THE DEVILS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THEN THE CO6PERATIONIST TRULY HAS FOUND A TALISMAN MORE DESIRED THAN EVER WAS THE PHILOSOPHERS STONE AND AN ENCHANTMENT MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY ALCHEMY THE LAW HOWEVER IS NOT QUITE A ASS NOTWITHSTANDING MR BUMBLE AND THE COOPERATIONISTS AND TO CO6PERATIONISTS WHO PRO FESS THAT NO MAN WHOSE AIM IN LIFE IS TO BEAR HIMSELF CREDITABLY AMONG HIS FELLOWS CARES TO SPLIT HAIRS WITH THE LAW TO TAKE ANY CHANCES ON A COURTS DECISION AS TO WHETHER HIS ACTS ARE REASONABLE OR UNREASONABLE THE DISAGREEABLE HABIT THE COURTS HAVE OF JUDG ING ACTS BY THEIR EFFECT INSTEAD OF BY THEIR FORM MAY YET PROVE DIS CONCERTING TAKE THE GARY DINNERS DISCUSSED BY THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN THE RECENTLY DECIDED GOVERNMENT SUIT AGAINST THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION WHERE AT A MEETING OF MANY PERSONS SAID JUDGE BUFFINGTON SUCH ACTION IS TAKEN WHOSE LEGALITY IS AFTERWARDS CALLED IN QUESTION THE DECISION MAY BE VITALLY AFFECTED BY ASCERTAINING THE FACT WHETHER THE ACTION WAS REALLY TAKEN BY EACH INDIVIDUAL ACTING FOR HIMSELF OR WHETHER THOSE PRESENT WERE IN FACT PURSUING A COMMON OBJECT  SUPPOSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THIS A NUMBER OF PERSONS TAKE NO ACTION ABOUT TERRITORY OR OUTPUT THEIR DISCUSSIONS BEING MAINLY CONCERNED WITH THE SUBJECT OF PRICE AND SUPPOSE FURTHER THAT THEY RE FRAIN FROM MAKING A DEFINITE FORMAL AGREEMENT AND LIMIT THEMSELVES TO AN UNDER STANDING A DECLARATION OF PURPOSEAN ANNOUNCEMENT OF INTENTIONWHAT THEN IS TO BE SAID HAVE THEY OFFENDED AGAINST THE LAW THIS QUESTION CANNOT BE ANSWERED UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT THE PARTICIPANTS WERE REALLY DOING IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO REST UPON THE VARYING NAMES THAT MAY BE GIVEN TO THE TRANSACTION AND THEN THE JUDGE QUOTED VARIOUS WITNESSES TO THE EFFECT THAT ALL THAT ANYBODY SAID AT THE GARY DINNERS WAS SUBSTANTIALLY MY PRICE IS SO AND SO OR MY PRICE WILL BE SO AND SO AND THE JUDGE CONCLUDED NOW TO OUR MINDS THE TESTIMONY TAKEN AS A WHOLE MAKES THE CONCLUSION INEVI TABLE THAT THE RESULT OF THESE MEETINGS WAS AN UNDERSTANDING ABOUT PRICES THAT WAS EQUIVALENT TO AN AGREEMENT WE HAVE NO DOUBT THAT AMONG THOSE PRESENT SOME SILENTLY DISSENTED AND WENT AWAY INTENDING TO DO WHAT THEY PLEASED BUT 74COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS MANY PROBABLY MOST OF THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERSTOOD AND ASSENTED TO THE VIEW THAT THEY WERE UNDER SOME KIND OF AN OBLIGATION TO ADHERE TO THE PRICES THAT HAD BEEN ANNOUNCED OR DECLARED AS THE GENERAL SENSE OF THE MEETING CERTAINLY THERE WAS NO POSITIVE AND EXPRESSED OBLIGATION NO FORMAL WORDS OF CONTRACT WERE USED BUT MOST OF THOSE WHO TOOK PART IN THESE MEETINGS WENT AWAY KNOWING THAT PRICES HAD BEEN NAMED AND FEELING BOUND TO MAINTAIN THEM UNTIL THEY SAW GOOD REASON TO DO OTHERWISE AND FEELING BOUND TO MAINTAIN THEM EVEN THEN UNTIL THEY HAD SIGNIFIED TO THEIR ASSOCIATES THEIR INTENTION TO MAKE A CHANGE WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT OR UNDERSTANDING OR MORAL OBLIGATIONWHATEVER NAME MAY BE THE MOST APPROPRIATEAMOUNTS TO A COMBINATION OR COMMON ACTION FORBIDDEN BY LAW THE FINAL TEST WE THINK IS THE OBJECT AND THE EFFECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT AND BOTH THE OBJECT AND EFFECT WERE TO MAINTAIN PRICES AT LEAST TO A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE ALL THE JUDGES IN THE STEEL CASE CONCURRED IN THIS CONCLUSION OF JUDGE BUFFINGTON AND TWO OF THEM TOOK PAINS TO SHOW THAT IN THEIR OPINION THE MERE STABILITY OF PRICES DURING THE CONTINUANCE OF THE GARY DINNERS IN CONTRAST WITH THE WIDE VARIATIONS IN PRICES DURING THE TIME WHEN THERE WERE NONE PRETTY CONCLUSIVELY ESTABLISHED THE ILLEGALITY OF GARY DINNERS JUDGED BY THIS TEST HOW WOULD AN OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION FARE THAT HAD ACHIEVED STABILITY OF PRICES REASONABLY STABLE AND NORMAL LEVELS FIXED PRICES FOR FIXED PERIODS AND ALL THE OTHER ADVERTISED OBJECTS OF CO6PERATION TAKE ANOTHER TEST LOOK AT THE OPEN DISCUSSIONS SO VALUED IN THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION THESE DISCUSSIONS THE CO6PERATION ISTEXPLAINS RELATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE CUTS AND COMPLAINTS AND QUESTIONS BY EACH OF THE MEMBERS REGARDING WORK TAKEN DURING THE PRECEDING MONTH BY THE MEMBER UNDER FIRE THE RIGHT TO PUBLISH PRICES EXCHANGE BIDS FREELY AND OPENLY TO DEAL FRANKLY WITH CUSTOMERS AND COMPETITORS EXCLAIMS THE CO6PERATIONIST ARE RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE CURTAILED BY ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THIS COUNTRY THE RIGHT OF A BODY OF MEN TO SAY WHAT THEY WILL DO MAY NOT BE CLEAR UNDER THE MANY ANTITRUST LAWS BUT WE HAVE YET TO HEAR OF A LAW THAT TRIES TO PREVENT MEN TELLING WHAT THEY HAVE DONE THESE RIGHTS HOWEVER AS THE STEEL DECISION SHOWS ARE ALL SUB JECT TO SERIOUS QUALIFICATIONS DOES THE COOPERATIONIST KEEP SAFELY WITHIN THEM WHEN THE COOPERATIONIST IS ORGANIZING THE OPEN PRICE ASSO CIATION HE RESTS IT ON THIS FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE NO BIDDER IS BOUND TO ADHERE TO HIS BID FOR THE FRACTION OF A SECOND AFTER ASCERTAINING THE BIDS OF OTHERS EACH IS FREE TO LOWER HIS OWN BID TO SECURE THE WORK  THE SAFE COURSE IS TO PROVIDE FOR CUTTING REMOVE ALL RESTRIC 75THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY TIONS SO THAT UNDER THE RULES OF THE ASSOCIATION NO MEMBER CAN SO MUCH AS QUES TION THE RIGHT OF ANOTHER TO BID AS FREELY AS OFTEN AND AS LOW AS HE PLEASES RECALLING THE OTHER FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION THAT KNOWL EDGE REGARDING BIDS AND PRICES ACTUALLY MADE IS ALL THAT IS NECESSARY TO KEEP PRICES AT REASONABLY STABLE AND NORMAL LEVELS IT IS A LITTLE SURPRISING LATER TO LEARN THAT QUESTIONS AND COMPLAINTS CAN ARISE AND MEMBERS CAN GO UNDER FIRE EVEN WHILE BOTH PROPOSITIONS ARE FULLY SATISFIED FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS HOWEVER ARE SUBJECT TO QUICK CHANGES IN THE CO6PERATIVE ERA HAVING FORMED HIS OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION THE CO6PERATIONIST PROMPTLY DISPENSES WITH HIS FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITION AND ADJURES THE NEW MEMBER THAT HAVING MADE HIS BID IF HE FINDS HE IS NOT THE LOWEST HE MUST NOT RUSH IN WITH A NEW BID TO GET THE WORK AWAY FROM A MAN FAIRLY ENTITLED TO IT     THE PRACTICE IS WRONG AND CONTRARY TO THE SPIRIT OF THE NEW COMPETITION   THE MAN WHO TRIES TO CHANGE HIS BID WILL BE LOOKED UPON AS ON A PAR WITH THE SECOND HAND CLOTHES DEALER THIS SURELY IS GOING UNDER FIRE WITH A VENGEANCE MANY AN ASSOCIATION AND COMBINATION HAS WITH LESS MORAL COMPULSION THAN THIS FOUND ITSELF IN THE UNWELCOME EMBRACES OF THE SHERMAN LAW CONSIDER ALSO THE OPEN DISCUSSIONS OF THE OPEN PRICE ASSO CIATION REGARDING THE ACTUAL CONDITIONS IN THE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY THEY SOUND INNOCENT THIS INQUIRY EXPLAINS THE COOPERATIONIST SHOULD TAKE UP EACH PLANT OR COMPANY REPRESENTED WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAINING AND NOTING BRIEFLY IN THE MINUTES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE PLANT IN ITS PARTICULAR LO CALITY AND WHY ITS CAPACITY LABOR EMPLOYED AND ITS DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY  IT IS ONLY BY A CAREFUL COMPARISON OF DATA THAT IT CAN BE ASCER TAINED WHETHER A GIVEN PLANT HAS ANY TERRITORY OR CUSTOMERS THAT NATURALLY DE PEND UPON IT   THIS INVESTIGATION EXPLAINS THE CO6PERATIONIST WITH AN EYE TO THE SHERMAN LAW HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANY SCHEME FOR ALLOTTING OR APPORTIONING BUSI NESS IT SIMPLY SEEKS TO GET AT THE FACTS BUT DOES IT A PLANT IS LOCATED SAY IN MINNEAPOLIS CON TINUES THE CO6PERATIONIST IT IS OBLIGED TO BUY ALL ITS RAW MATERIAL IN PENNSYLVANIA IT IS IN COMPETITION WITH PENNSYLVANIA COMPANIES THAT SHIP THE FINISHED PRODUCT TO THE NORTHWEST ON ITS FACE THE SITUATION SEEMS TO LOOK DESPERATE FOR THE MINNEAPOLIS COMPANY  IF THE PENNSYLVANIA COMPANIES ARE BIDDING RECKLESSLY FOR BUSINESS THEY ARE NOT FAIRLY ENTITLED TO THEY MAY DEPRESS PRICES FOR A TIME  THE RIGHT COMMITTEE COULD MAKE A REPORT THAT WOULD SET FORTH IN DETAIL THE ADVAN TAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF EVERY MEMBER OF THE ASSOCIATION AND IN SO FAR AS IT CAN LEGALLY DO SO IT SHOULD BE THE EFFORT OF THE ASSOCIATION TO HELP EACH MEMBER TO 76COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS HOLD THE TRADE LEGITIMATELY BELONGING TO IT AS AGAINST UNFAIR AND DESTRUCTIVE COM PETITION FAIRLY AND LEGITIMATELY ARE HERE QUESTIONBEGGING TERMS THE CONTROLLING WORDS UNFORTUNATELY FROM THE LEGAL STANDPOINT ARE BUSINESS THEY ARE NOT ENTITLED TO AND TRADE BELONGING TO IT MANY AN ASSOCIATION AND COMBINATION THOUGH LESS ACTIVE THAN THIS IN SUG GESTING AN ALLOTMENT OF TERRITORY HAS BEEN BROKEN ON THE WHEEL OF THE SHERMAN LAW THE TROUBLE WITH THE CO6PERATIONIST IS THAT HE HAS NEVER BEEN QUITE HONEST WITH HIS PROBLEM TOO MANY IMPROVEMENTS WHICH HE HAS CLAIMED COULD ONLY BE OBTAINED THROUGH COOPERATION HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING ACCOMPLISHED BY TRADE ORGANIZATIONS OF UNQUESTIONED LEGALITY THROUGH COLLECTIVE ACTION FREE FROM ALL SUSPICION OF CONTROL TOO MANY DEVELOPMENTS WHICH HE DISAPPROVES AND PROPOSES TO CURE BY COOPERATION HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING RECOGNIZED AND APPROVED AS ENTIRELY WHOLESOME ECO NOMIC TENDENCIES AND TOO MANY EVILS WHICH HE HAS CLAIMED COULD ONLY BE CURED BY COOPERATION HAVE BEEN AND ARE BEING REMEDIED BY THE MUCH DESPISED ANTITRUST LAWS COLLECTIVE ACTION WHEN NOT DIRECTED TOWARD INFLUENCING PRICES LIMITING OUTPUT ALLOTTING TERRITORY OR IN ANY OTHER WAY SUBSTAN TIALLY LESSENING COMPETITION HAS ALWAYS BEEN ENDORSED UPON THE VERY HIGHEST AUTHORITY THE WORK OF NUMEROUS TRADE ASSOCIATIONS IN STANDARDIZING OF MATERIALS NEGOTIATING FOR MORE EQUITABLE FREIGHT RATES RECOVERING REFUNDS FOR EXCESSIVE FREIGHT CHARGES PROVIDING MUTUAL FIRE INSURANCE SIMPLIFYING TERMS AND INSTRUMENTS OF CREDIT AND LIMITING CREDIT RISKS HAS OFTEN BEEN HEARTILY COMMENDED BY THE GOVERNMENT EVEN COST ACCOUNTING TO A CERTAIN EXTENT IS HIGHLY LEGITIMATE WORK FOR A TRADE ASSOCIATION APART FROM THIS ASPECT OF PRICE REGULATION DECLARED THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WHILE HE WAS COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS IT MAY BE A PROPER FUNCTION OF TRADE ASSOCIATIONS TO ASSIST MEMBERS TO ADOPT A PROPER SYSTEM OF COST ACCOUNTING THAT SHALL ACCURATELY MEASURE AMOUNTS AC TUALLY EXPENDED FOR OR CHARGEABLE TO PRODUCTION THE ADOPTION OF STANDARD SPECI FICATIONS RECOMMENDED BY ASSOCIATIONS IS OFTEN OF ADVANTAGE TO BOTH MANUFACTUR ERS AND PURCHASERS AND TENDS TO PROMOTE ECONOMIES IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE2 2THESE AND SOME OTHER QUOTATIONS THAT FOLLOW ARE FROM FARMMACHINERY TRADE ASSOCIATIONS DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE BUREAU OF CORPORATIONS MARCH 15 1915 THEIR SIGNIFICANCE IS ENHANCED BY THE FACT THAT THE THEN COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS IS NOW CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION 77THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN THESE DAYS SAID JUDGE BUFFINGTON IN THE STEEL CASE EVERY LARGE BUSINESS HAS ITS SOCIETIES AND ASSOCIATIONS AND THESE MEET PERIODICALLY TO EXCHANGE INFORMATION OF ALL KINDS TO COMPARE EXPERIENCES TO TAKE NOTE OF IMPROVEMENTS IN MACHINERY OR PROCESS TO DISCUSS PROBLEMS AND GENERALLY TO PROFIT BY THE INTERCHANGE OF IDEAS AND THE STUDY OF OBSERVED FACTS WHILE SO MANY ACTIVITIES OF UNQUESTIONED LEGALITY ARE AVAILABLE TO TRADE ORGANIZATIONS PERSISTENT ACTIVITY IN DIRECTIONS MEASURABLY AFFECTING PRICES CAN HARDLY FAIL TO INVITE INTERFERENCE FROM THE ANTI TRUST LAWS MUCH THAT THE COOPERATIONIST HAS ATTEMPTED HAS NOT REALLY RE QUIRED COLLECTIVE ACTION COST ACCOUNTING FOR EXAMPLE IS ESSENTIAL IN MODERN BUSINESS AND STANDARD SYSTEMS OF COST ACCOUNTING ADAPTED TO THE NEEDS OF PARTICULAR INDUSTRIES ARE ALWAYS LEGITIMATE WHETHER PROPOSED BY TRADE ASSOCIATIONS OR PROMULGATED BY INDIVIDUALS WHEN GOODS ARE SOLD IN COMPETITION OF ONE ANOTHER HOWEVER INDIVIDUAL COSTS COM PUTED ACCORDING TO ANY SYSTEM OF COST ACCOUNTING ARE ESSENTIALLY A PURELY INDIVIDUAL MATTER COST ACCOUNTING WAS DEVISED TO PROD INDIVIDUAL BUSINESSES TO GREATER ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY SO THAT THEY MIGHT MORE SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH THEIR RIVALS FULL AND ADE QUATE SCOPE TO COST ACCOUNTING THEREFORE IS GIVEN WHEN IT IS CONFINED TO THIS FUNCTION ALONE WHEN COMPETITORS EXCHANGE FIGURES REGARD ING EACH OTHERS COSTS FOR THE PURPOSE OR WITH THE HOPE THAT COMPETI TION MAY BE TEMPERED TO THE HIGHEST INDIVIDUAL COSTS THIS FUNCTION IS ENTIRELY FRUSTRATED HOW CLEARLY THIS IS UNDERSTOOD IN GOVERNMENT CIRCLES WAS SHOWN BY THE CHAIRMAN OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WHILE HE WAS COMMISSIONER OF CORPORATIONS IF THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES HE DECLARED FORBID DIRECT REGULATION OF PRICES BY COMPETITORS AMONG THEMSELVES AS AGREEMENTS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE IT SHOULD BE DETERMINED WHETHER THEY DO NOT ALSO FORBID THE REGULATION OF PRICES BY INDIRECTION THROUGH CONCERTED ACTION OF COMPETITORS IN ADOPTING A UNIFORM SYSTEM OF COST ACCOUNTING IN EXCHANGING INFORMATION IN REGARD TO THEIR COSTS AND THROUGH RECOMMENDATIONS TO FIX PRICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE COST THE ADOPTION OF COMMON STANDARDS OF COST AND THE EXCHANGE OF INFORMATION IN REGARD THERETO IS MAINLY TO SECURE A SIMILAR COURSE OF ACTION ON THE PART OF EACH MEMBER THE PRINCIPLE HOWEVER OF SUCH A DETERMINATION OF PRICES THROUGH COSTS IS NOT IN HARMONY WITH THE PRINCIPLE OF COMPETITIVE PRICES IT IS EVIDENT MOREOVER THAT THE PLAN OF MEETING TO DISCUSS AND COMPARE COSTS COMPUTED ON THIS BASIS INVOLVES THE POSSIBILITY OF AGREEMENTS IN RESPECT TO ADOPTION OF PRICES BASED UPON THE HIGHEST COSTS REPORTED OR OF AGREEMENTS TO ADD A HIGH UNIFORM ARBITRARY RATE OF 78COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS PROFIT OR EVEN DIRECT AGREEMENTS ON PRICES THE QUESTION TO BE EMPHASIZED HERE IS WHETHER COMPETING MANUFACTURERS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO ESTABLISH AND MAINTAIN EVEN APPROXIMATELY UNIFORM PRICES BY CONCERTED ACTION IN COMPARING COSTS AND WHETHER SUCH PROCEEDINGS ARE FREE FROM THE DANGERS AND OBJECTIONS INCIDENT TO MORE DIRECT METHODS OF FIXING UNIFORM PRICES AMONG COMPETITORS WHILE THE COSTEDUCATIONAL MOVEMENT HAS VARIOUS ASPECTS THE IMPORTANT FACT TO BE CONSIDERED IS THAT THE METHOD OF FIXING PRICES THROUGH COIPERATIVE STUDY OF COSTS IS NOT MERELY SUSCEPTIBLE OF ABUSE IN PARTICULAR CASES BUT DIRECTLY MILITATES AGAINST INDEPENDENT ACTION ON THE PART OF COMPETITORS ONE OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS OF THE NEW COMPETI TION ASSERTS THE COOPERATIONIST IS THAT IN SO FAR AS HUMAN SAGACITY CAN PREVENT NO MAN SHALL BE PERMITTED TO SELL LABOR OR MATERIAL BELOW COST BUT THE COOPERATIONIST IS WRONG WHAT THE NEW COMPETI TION PROPOSES IS THAT IN SO FAR AS HUMAN SAGACITY CAN PREVENT NO MAN SHALL LACK INDIVIDUAL AND LAWFUL MEANS OF KNOWING WHETHER OR NOT HE IS SELLING LABOR OR MATERIAL BELOW COST BETWEEN THESE TWO PROPOSITIONS LIES ALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN CO6PERATION AND THE REALLY NEW COMPETITION HOW UTTERLY THE COOPERATIONIST HAS MISSED THE TREND OF THE REALLY NEW COMPETITION APPEARS FROM HIS PROPOSAL FOR SEGREGATION UNDER SEGREGATION HE EXPLAINS THE TRUST OR LARGE CORPORATION REMAINS INTACT BUT IN THE OPERATION OF ITS DIFFERENT COMPANIES OR BRANCHES AND IN PRODUCING AND SELLING ITS DIFFERENT LINES OF PRODUCTS IT IS REQUIRED TO KEEP ITS ACCOUNTS AND MAKE ITS REPORTS IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EACH WILL STAND BY ITSELF AND BE SUBJECT TO EASY INVESTIGATION AND READY COMPARISON BY SEGREGATION THE COOPERATIONIST PROPOSES TO COMPEL THEM TO MAKE MORE MONEY BY MAKING EACH DEPARTMENT TAKE A PROFIT AS THE MATERIAL PASSES THROUGH DEPARTMENT AFTER DEPARTMENT TO THE FINISHED PRODUCT THE SUPPOSED RIGHT TO SELL ANYTHING BELOW COST THAT IS EXCEPT AT A FAIR PROFITEXPLAINS THE CO6PERATIONIST CANNOT BE MADE TO TURN UPON WHETHER THE PARTICULAR ARTICLE IS OR IS NOT RELATED TO SOME OTHER ARTICLE MADE OR HANDLED BY THE SAME MAN OR COMPANY NECESSARILY SEGREGATION IS COROLLARY TO THE WHOLE PROPOSITION OF COOPERATION COROLLARY AND PROPOSITION MUST STAND OR FALL TO GETHER AND THE COROLLARY HAS ALREADY FALLEN THE NOTION THAT INTEGRATED INDUSTRY SHOULD SERVE THE COMMUNITY ONLY UPON TERMS THAT WILL SUPPORT UNINTEGRATED INDUSTRY AND THAT SO LONG AS ANY VESTIGE OF THE OLD UNECONOMICAL ORDER PERSISTS THE COMMUNITY SHALL BE DENIED THE SAVINGS OF THE NEW ECONOMICAL 79THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY ORDER HAS NEVER COMMENDED ITSELF TO HUMAN NATURE AND IS CONTRA DICTED BY THE WHOLE TREND OF LEGAL AND POPULAR THOUGHT THIS NOTION IS IDENTICAL WITH AN UNHAPPY CONCEPTION OF THE SHERMAN LAW THAT ONCE OBSESSED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WHENCE THE COOPERATIONIST APPEARS TO HAVE BORROWED IT TO WEAR PERCHANCE AS A BADGE OF SAFETY ANY VITALITY IT EVER MAY HAVE HAD WAS SAPPED BY THE RULE OF REASON ANNOUNCED BY THE SUPREME COURT IN THE STANDARD OIL AND AMERICAN TOBACCO CASES AND RECEIVED ITS COUP DE GRACE WHEN THE SUPREME COURT SUSTAINED THE COMBINATION PRESENTED IN THE UNITED SHOE MACHINERY COMPANY AND HELD THAT THE DISINTEGRATION AIMED AT BY THE STATUTE DOES NOT EXTEND TO REDUCING ALL MANU FACTURE TO ISOLATED UNITS OF THE LOWEST DEGREE IT IS JUST AS LAWFUL TO MAKE EVERY PART OF A STEAM ENGINE AND TO PUT THE MACHINE TOGETHER AS IT WOULD BE FOR ONE TO MAKE THE BOILERS AND ANOTHER TO MAKE THE WHEELS SOMEWHAT LESS EPIGRAMMATIC PERHAPS BUT FAR MORE IMPRESSIVE IN ITS MASS IS THE UTTER REJECTION OF THIS NOTION OF SEGREGATION IMPLIED IN THE RECENT DECISION OF THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT UPHOLDING THE COLLOSSAL INTEGRATION OF THE UNITED STATES STEEL CORPORATION SINCE 1912 INDEED THE WHOLE TREND OF JUDICIAL INTERPRETATION OF THE SHERMAN LAW AND OF LEGISLATIVE ADDITIONS TO THE ANTITRUST LAWS HAS CUT UNDER THE FOUNDATION OF CO6PERATION EVILS FOR WHICH COOPERATION CLAIMED TO BE THE SOLE REMEDY HAVE BEEN REACHED AND CURED BY THE DESPISED SHERMAN LAW OR BY THE SUPPLEMENTARY LEGIS LATION ADOPTED IN 1914 ALL THE DIFFICULTIES FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE COOPERATIONIST CONJURED UP AROUND THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULE NOT TO UNDERSELL A RIVAL WHERE THE PURPOSE IS TO DRIVE HIM OUT OF BUSINESS HAVE MANY TIMES BEEN SURMOUNTED BY THE COURTS IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE SHERMAN LAW THE SUGGESTION THAT CO6PERATING ASSOCIATIONS ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY TO ELIMINATE THOSE BRUTAL FEATURES OF COMPETITION HAS REPEATEDLY BEEN REFUTED BY DECISIONS UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW SO ALSO WITH SECRET REBATES TERMS COMMISSIONS     SELLING TO ONE MAN ON BETTER TERMS THAN ARE CHARGED HIS COMPETITOR  SELLING IN ONE LOCALITY AT DIFFERENT PRICES THAN THOSE CHARGED IN ANOTHERALL OTHER THINGS BEING EQUAL THE CO6PERATIONISTS WAY OF PUNISHING AND PREVENTING THEM IS THROUGH THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION THESE ARE PRACTICAL PROPOSITIONS OF WIDEREACHING IMPORTANCE SAID THE CO6PERATIONIST AND CAN BE WORKED OUT ONLY BY THE MEN ACTUALLY CONCERNED BUT EVENTS HAVE NOT FALLEN OUT AS THE CO6PERATIONIST PROPOSED THE CLAYTON LAW OF 80COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS 1914 FORBIDDING WITH CERTAIN REASONABLE EXCEPTIONS EVERY DIS CRIMINATION IN PRICE WHERE THE EFFECT OF SUCH DISCRIMINATION MAY BE TO SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN COMPETITION OR TEND TO CREATE A MONOPOLY HAS EXACTLY REACHED THE EVIL FOR WHICH CO6PERATION PROFESSED TO BE THE ONLY REMEDY3 THE GREATEST MISCARRIAGE IN THE COOPERATIONISTS PROGRAM HOWEVER HAS BEEN THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WITHOUT ASSOCIATIONS DECLARES THE CO6PERATIONIST IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR A FEDERAL COMMISSION TO ENFORCE THE PROPOSED PRO VISIONS WHICH ARE GENERAL IN CHARACTER ONLY THE PARTIES ENGAGED IN A TRADE OR INDUSTRY ARE IN A POSITION TO WORK OUT THE DETAILS AND FORMULATE THE RULES NECES SARY TO COMPEL OBEDIENCE THE FUNCTION OF THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION IN THE COOP ERATIONISTS PROGRAM THEREFORE WAS SIMPLY TO ENFORCE THE RULES OF THE CO6PERATING ASSOCIATIONS THE COOPERATING ASSOCIATIONS WERE TO 8 THE CO6PERATIONISTS DISTORTED NOTION OF THE SHERMAN LAW AND THE CLAYTON LAW IN THEIR RELATION TO UNFAIR COMPETITION APPEARS IN HIS EFFORT TO PROVE THAT THE BROAD PROVISIONS OF THE NEW LAW ARE IN LINE WITH THE SPIRIT AND ARGUMENT OF HIS OWN PROPOSALS INVEIGHING AGAINST THE CUT THROAT SPIRIT OF THE SHERMAN LAW HE EXCLAIMS THE SPIRIT OF THE SHERMAN LAW IS UNRESTRICTED COMPETITION AND THAT MEANS UNRESTRICTED DISCRIMINATION THE BITTERER AND MORE VICIOUS THE BETTER THE SPIRIT OF THE CLAYTON ACT IS TREAT ALL MEN FAIRLY DO NOTHING TO INJURE YOUR COMPETITOR UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW IT IS ALMOST A PRESUMPTION OF GUILT IF YOUR PRICES ARE THE SAME AS YOUR COMPETITORS UNDER THE CLAYTON ACT IT IS ALMOST A PRESUMPTION OF GUILT IF THEY ARE NOT THE SAME UNDER THE SHERMAN LAW YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING FOUND GUILTY IF BEFORE MAKING YOUR OWN PRICES IN A GIVEN TOWN YOU ASK THE LOCAL DEALER WHAT HIS PRICES ARE AND CHARGE THE SAME UNDER THE CLAYTON ACT YOU RUN THE RISK OF BEING FOUND GUILTY IF YOU GO INTO A TOWN AND MAKE PRICES WITHOUT FIRST LEARNING WHAT THE LOCAL DEALER ASKS FOR THE CLAYTON ACT SIM PLY PERMITS YOU TO MEET COMPETITION IN SHORT THE CLAYTON ACT MAKES IT ESSEN TIAL FOR A MAN TO ACT VERY CAUTIOUSLY LEST HE INJURE A COMPETITOR BY WITTINGLY OR UNWITTINGLY DISCRIMINATING IN PRICES AS FOR DELIBERATELY TAKING AN ORDER BELOW COST TO GET BUSINESS AWAY FROM A COMPETITOR THAT IS QUITE WITHOUT THE PALE OF THE ACT IN VIEW OF THE SHERMAN LAW DECISIONS IN THE STANDARD OIL THE AMERICAN TOBACCO THE POWDER THE TURPENTINE THE WATCH CASE THE CASH REGISTER AND THE STEAMSHIP CASESNOT TO MENTION MANY LESS FAMILIAR DECISIONS AND MANY CASES THAT HAVE BEEN SETTLED BY CONSENT DECREESIT WOULD SEEM HARDLY NECESSARY TO STATE THAT THE SHERMAN LAW EFFECTIVELY PUNISHED CUT THROAT COMPE TITION LONG BEFORE COOPERATION OR THE CLAYTON LAW WERE EVER THOUGHT OF AND THAT ANY BUSINESS MAN WHO ADOPTS THE COOPERATIONISTS INTERPRETATION OF THE CLAY TON LAW AS AN ENDORSEMENT OF COOPERATION IS LIABLE TO INCUR VERY DISAGREEABLE PENALTIES FAR FROM REPEALING THE SHERMAN LAW AS AFFECTING BUSINESS COMPETITION THE CLAYTON LAW PRACTICALLY PARAPHRASES AND CONFIRMS IT 81THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BECOME THE CENTER OF GOVERNMENT SO FAR AS THE REGULATION OF BUSI NESS WAS CONCERNED AND ALL RESTRICTIONS UPON THE ORGANIZATION OF ASSOCIATIONS AND COMBINATIONS TO CONTROL OCCUPATIONS TRADES AND IN DUSTRIES WERE TO BE COMPLETELY REMOVED BUT THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AS CREATED IN 1914 WAS A STRIKING CONTRADICTION OF THIS PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BEING MADE TO DANCE ATTENDANCE UPON COBP ERATION OR REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE ACTS OF THE ASSOCIATION REVISE AND FIX PRICES AND CONDITIONS OF PURCHASE AND SALES AWARD DAMAGES ENFORCE PENALTIES OR CHARGED WITH THE DUTY TO SEE THAT PRICES ARE MAINTAINED PRECISELY AS AGREED  AND KEEP THEM FAIR AND STABLE THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN PLANTED FOURSQUARE UPON THE SHERMAN LAW AND PRECLUDED BY ITS ESSENTIAL POWERS AND DUTIES FROM PLAYING ANY SUCH R6LE AS THE COOPERATIONIST HAD ASSIGNED TO IT EMPOWERED TO PREVENT UNFAIR METHODS OF COMPETITION IN COM MERCE PRICE DISCRIMINATIONS AND VARIOUS OTHER PRACTICES TENDING TO SUBSTANTIALLY LESSEN COMPETITION THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OR NEED OF ANY OF THE PARAPHERNALIA OF COOP ERATION NOW SECURES TO EVERY INDIVIDUAL ASSOCIATION CORPORATION PARTNERSHIP FIRM AND EVERY MAN WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE WHOLE UNITED STATES EVERY LEGITIMATE BENEFIT THAT COOPERATION EVER PRO FESSED TO SECURE TO ITS OWN EXCLUSIVE MEMBERSHIP INDIVIDUALISM RATHER THAN COLLECTIVISM IS THE GENIUS OF AMERI CAN INSTITUTIONS THAT IS WHY THE SHERMAN LAW WITH ITS STAUNCH AFFIRMANCE OF THE INDIVIDUALISTIC PRINCIPLE AND ITS SUSPICION AND HOSTILITY TOWARDS TRUSTS COMBINATIONS POOLS ASSOCIATIONS AND EVERY OTHER MANIFESTATION OF THE COLLECTIVISTIC PRINCIPLE HAS BECOME THE ELEVENTH COMMANDMENT OF AMERICAN ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL LIFE THAT IS WHY COOPERATION WITH ALL ITS BLANDISHMENTS AND ENCHANT MENTS HAS NEVER LURED AND NEVER CAN LURE THE COURTS OR ANY CONSID ERABLE PROPORTION OF THE PEOPLE FROM THEIR FAITH IN THE CONTRARY PRINCIPLE EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH AND BIG SIZE ARE THE COMMON AMBITIONS OF MANKIND AND ARE NOT CRIMINAL ACCRETION AND INTEGRATION AS THE STEEL CASE AND SHOE MACHINERY CASE HAVE SHOWN ARE STRICTLY TRUE TO INDIVIDUALISM AND THEREFORE WITHIN THE LIMITS DETERMINED BY EFFI CIENCY ARE HELD TO BE LEGITIMATE MANY CONCERNS NOW MEMBERS OF MORE OR LESS FURTIVE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION COULD PROBABLY COME TOGETHER NOT ALL IN THE SAME GROUP PERHAPS BUT IN SEVERAL GROUPS EACH OF SUBSTANTIAL SIZE IN CLOSER AND MORE PRACTICAL AND MORE PER 82COOPERATION AND THE ANTITRUST LAWS MANENT COMBINATION THEN THEY HAVE YET DREAMED OF AND YET WITH ENTIRE SAFETY FROM THE ANTITRUST LAWS TO SUCH CONCERNS THE ELAB ORATE RITUAL OF THE OPEN PRICE ASSOCIATION NOW BRINGS ONLY EX PENSE WITHOUT ANY ADDED LEGAL SAFETY AND ATTEMPTS IN A CLUMSY TENTATIVE AND INDIRECT FASHION TO DO WHAT CAN REALLY BE ACCOM PLISHED IN A HANDIER MORE DEFINITE AND MORE DIRECT FASHION WITH LESS EXPENSE AND REALLY GREATER LEGAL SAFETY WERE THEY TO DROP SUBTERFUGE AND COMBINE INTO UNITS EACH ECONOMICALLY AND COMPET ITIVELY EFFECTIVE AND NEITHER TOO FEW NOR TOO LARGE TO PREVENT SUB STANTIAL COMPETITION BETWEEN SUCH UNITS IT IS SUBMITTED THAT EVERYTHING DESIRABLE IN CO6PERATION WOULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT OFFENDING AGAINST THE LETTER OR THE SPIRIT OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS ACCRETION AND INTEGRATION INTO STRONG EFFECTIVE ECONOMIC UNITS OF CONCERNS NOW TOO WEAK TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WILL IT IS BELIEVED PROVE MORE ADEQUATE THAN THE ASSOCIATION IDEA IN THE SOLUTION OF PROBLEMS THAT CO6PERATION HAS VAINLY TRIED TO SOLVE ACCRETION AND INTERGRATION MAKING FOR EFFICIENCY RATHER THAN SUP PRESSION OF COMPETITION DERIVE NOT FROM CO6PERATION BNT FROM IN LIVIDUALISM THEY ARE WHOLLY INDIVIDUALISTIC DEVELOPMENTS THEY FULFILL THE HIGHEST PURPOSE OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS CO6PERATION ASKS THE INDIVIDUAL TO TRANSFER HIS RELIANCE FROM HIMSELF AND FROM HIS GOVERNMENT AND TO PLACE IT IN AN ASSOCIATION OF HIS COMPETITORS BUT THE SHERMAN LAW THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE CLAY TON LAW ALL ASSERT THE INDIVIDUALS RELIANCE IN HIMSELF AND IN HIS GOVERNMENT WITH NO SACRIFICE OF THE INDIVIDUALISTIC PRINCIPLE THEY SECURE TO HIM EVERYTHING LEGITIMATE THAT CO6PERATION PROMISES AND HELP HIM WORK OUT HIS ECONOMIC SALVATION AND INDEPENDENCE IN TRADITIONAL AMERICAN FASHION 83

transferability of labor and capital respectively After a short discussion of the reasons for the general neglect into which English political econ omy has of late fallen in which he gives nearly all reasons except the right one viz that it is an outlived theory the author proceeds to show that the Ricardian assumption of the easy and rapid transferability of labor and capital among various industries never has been true and is not true now though it may be true in the distant future A more complete vindication of the justice of the attacks on Ricardos system so far as it is claimed to be a satisfactory expla nation of our modern industrial economy could scarcely be desired Had Mr Bagehot lived to finish the great work of which these essays were to form a part it can scarcely be doubted that he would have followed out his premises to their legitimate conclusions and finally have been found where he belonged among the opponents instead of among the restaters of orthodoxy C R TEMPERATURE OF THE MOONS SUR FACE PROFESSOR LANGLEYS two most important dis coveries  1 that the greater part of the energy in the solar spectrum is way below the visible red and 2 that our atmosphere is more and more transparent to radiant energy the greater its wave length promise to bear fruit in many directions In his paper on the temperature of the surface of the moon one of their applications is shown in the complete upsetting of the longcherished idea that the temperature of the moons surface rises to 200 or 300 F during the lunar day and falls about as far below zero in the lunar night First enun ciated as a theory by Sir John Herschel the only experimental evidence upon which it has rested has been the observations of lunar radia tion by the present Earl of Rosse to which Pro fessor Langley takes no exception so far as the experimental results are concerned but from their interpretation by Lord Rosse he entirely dis sents This interpretation rests upon the assump tions 1 that solar radiation is principally con fined to luminous vibrations 2 that about 92 per cent of these are transmitted by glass and 3 that only 16 per cent of the obscure rays are trans mitted by glass The first has already been shown 1 Memoirs of the National academy of sciences vol iii pt i 2d memoir On the temperature of the surface of the moon By S P LANGLEY Washington Government 1885 40 i jJ CE LVOL VI No 144 to be entirely wrong and when it is remembered that Professor Langley found over twothirds of the total energy in the solar spectrum from a glass prism to lie below the visible red nothing further need be said as to the nonconclusiveness of any deductions from the above assumptions Professor Langleys observations on Mt Whitney lead him to the conclusion that were it not for our atmosphere the surface of the earth even under continuous direct sunshine would be at a temperature of only about 48 C above that of surrounding space whatever that may be at any rate low enough to freeze every thing up solid perhaps even the gases and he concludes that the moon is in this condition unless it has an appre ciably absorbing atmosphere of which there are only some uncertain suggestions at present Attacking the problem entirely anew he speaks of its importance as follows   The amount of heat received from the moon and the dependent question as to the temperature of the lunar surface are subjects of greater inter est to us than might at first appear They are even ones in which we may be said to have a material concern for until we know the tempera ture which an airless planet would attain in the suns rays we can have no accurate knowledge of the extent to which the atmosphere of our own planet contributes to its heat nor of some of the most important conditions of our own ex istence Professor Langley describes important improve ments in the galvanometer used with his bolom eter so that with the combination of the two he is now able when the needle is damped to a period of 10s to make lmm on the scale correspond to a current of only 00000000013 of an ampere or indicate a difference of temperature of only 0000016 C As regards precision of measure ment the probable error of a single observation is only about 2 per cent of the total amount of lunar radiation while in Lord Rosses work the probable error of the mean of a series of 10 observations was 19 per cent thus giving one of the former a weight equal to several hundred of the latter to say nothing of its far greater freedom from con stant errors With this apparatus and with all the other re finements and precautions against error which invariably accompany all of Professor Langleys work he has been making the following investi gations  1 Direct measurement of lunar heat compared with solar 2 Comparison of moons heat with that of Leslie cube hot water 3 Transmission of lunar heat by the earths atmosphere 4 Comparative transmission of glass for lunar andSCIENCE solar heat 5 Observations during a lunar eclipse 6 Formation of a lunar heat spectrum We can only summarize the results and they are best given in his own words  While we have found abundant evidence of heat from the moon every method we have tried or that has been tried by others for determining the character of this heat appears to us inconclusive and without questioning that the moon radiates heat earth ward from its soil we have not yet found any experimental means of discriminating with such certainty between this and the reflected heat that it is not open to misinterpretation Whether we do so or not in the future will probably depend on our ability to measure by some process which will inform us directly of the wavelengths of the heat observed Were this all it would be a somewhat discour aging ending but the best and most important part is a note added February 1885 which we quote in full  Since the above paragraph was written we have succeeded in obtaining measures with rock salt prisms and lenses in a lunar heat spectrum These difficult measures must be repeated at many lunations before complete results can be obtained but considering their importance to the present subject we think it best to state now in general terms and with the reserve due to the necessity of future experiment that they indicate two maxima in the heat curve one corresponding within the limits of errors of observation to the solar curve maximum the second indefinitely lower down in the spectrum corresponding to a greater amount of heat at a lower temperature Exactly what temperature this latter corresponds to we have no present means of knowing We have succeeded however in forming a measurable heat spectrum from the surface of a Leslie cube containing boiling water and the maximum ordinate in the lunar heat curve appears to be below the maximum ordinate in the hot water curve The inference from this is of course that the temperature of the lunar soil is at any rate below that of boiling water and in an indefinite degree We cannot close this note without calling attention to the remarkable fact that we here seem to have radiations from the moon of lower wave length than from the sun which implies an ap parent contradiction to the almost universally accepted belief that the suns emanations like those from any heated solid body include all low wavelengths representing temperatures inferior to those certainly emitted Further comment is unnecessary The novelty and importance of the above is selfevident H M PAUL 413 ILLUSTRATIONS OF RECENT ITALIAN PSYCHOLOGY THE science of psychology is still somewhat in the position of the young man who has just passed his twentyfirst birthday While really entitled to all the rights and dignities belonging to any of the citizens of the republic of science yet these privileges are accorded with somewhat of a re luctant spirit especially on the part of the older citizens who seem rather startled at the notion of receiving on terms of equality so very youthful and so very presumptuous a candidate But now that special professorships in this department have been instituted at several of our universities and colleges now that the questions which it dis cusses find a hearing before appropriate sections of the great scientific associations for it is scientific psychology alone that is meant that special so cieties and journals are devoted to the encourage ment of its progress it may fairly be presumed that whatever of a protest to this reception still makes itself heard is only the echo of bygone days While the greatest part of our experimental knowledge of mind is undoubtedly due to German writers and workers France and Italy have also contributed much to raise the science to its present position In France the Revue jphilosophique of which M Ribot whose psychological works are well known to English readers is the editor pays special attention to the strictly scientific side of its domain There has been founded too a society of physiological psychology especially devoted to the consideration of experimental topics In Italy the Rivista sperimentale di freniatria edited by M A Tamburini and the Archivio di psichiatria etc edited by M Cesare Lombroso devote much of their energies to another side of the subject Both the writers just mentioned are deeply interested in the psychology of the criminal and other classes of defectives The voluminous work of M Lom broso Uomo delinquente is a standard in this line of research The Revue philosophique for Septem ber enlarges the circle of readers of some of these researches by presenting a summary of articles from the two Italian journals In the hope of still further increasing the usefulness of these contri butions to psychology some account of them is given here M Ferri has made a special study of the reli gious sentiment in the criminal class and intends to publish a volume on this subject He found in a very large number of criminals examined only a single one who did not believe in the ex istence of a God and most of them belonged to the established church Many of them are de NOVEMBER 6 1885

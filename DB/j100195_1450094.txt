j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1450094,Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures,i263121,The Jewish Quarterly Review MANY MOODS IN THE HEBREW SCRIPTURES To both Jewish and Christian orthodoxy of a hundred years ago all the writers of the Old Testament spoke a single mind All were supposed to hold the same opinions to teach and to cling to the same ideals The conception of God which seemed true to Moses was the same conception which satisfied Isaiah and one view of mans relation to the divine expressed the sentiments both of Jeremiah and of Ezra It is criticism which has restored to the Bible its original variety of life and colour Just as in the human structure the interconnection of mind and matter is so much more com plex than was supposed erewhile so too in the Bible the human and divine elements are far more subtly transfused than the pious simplicity of an earlier age believed It is through the very variety of its human aspect that what we call the inspiration of the Bible is now recognised and revered Yet there are two ways in which this variety is limited One is that because it is a collection of the religious and historical writings of a single race the Bible by which term I here mean the Old Testament only takes for granted through out one or two fundamental religious convictions from which it never deflects That Yahveh is the God of Israel and that Yahveh is a God of righteousnessthese are assertions which however differently they might be expressed and whatever difference in implication they might contain for different ages and minds would never have been flatly con tradicted by any Israelite from David to Judas the Mac cabee This limitation is obvious and familiar the other though undoubtedly very important is as yet of unascer tained range We may call it the editorial limitation and it shows itself in different ways Certain functions of the Old Testament editors have only quite recently been more nar rowly inquired into and till the criticism of Stade and his school has been systematically examined there must remain considerable doubt in many important details relat ing to this work of the Biblical editors Its method how I refer especially to their work in Stades excellent Zeitschkrift fdr die alttestamentliche WVisenthaft Into the field of this criticism it should be noted that Geiger led the way Compare the Ueberarbcitung chapter in his Urschrift pp 72101 142Mansy Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures ever is already clear Much of it is comprised in that useful German word for which unfortunately we have no English equivalent Ueberarbeituzg The historical books pro vide the best field for these critical investigations Their re sults we see most satisfactorily in those chapters of Samuel in which a clearly primitive train of thought is rounded off or interlarded with far later reflections and ideas How much the editors may have omitted from their originals we cannot tell it is very probable that many a passage into which even they could not read their own religious convictions was left out or greatly modified Even in the prophetical writings we have though with reserve to be on the watch for the editors hands Not merely as almost everybody nowa days is aware are whole chapters appended to one prophets utterances which belong to a different age eg Isaiah xllxvi Zechariah ixxiv but even within single chapters a care ful though sometimes too subtle criticism has shown with more or less convincing exactitude the presence of editorial accretions If then an attempt is made to prove an identity of thought between let us say Jeremiah and Ezra by the help of a few verses from the former which are used to counterbalance a number of other passages which ordinarily would suggest a considerable difference between these two writers we must first be sure that the argument of the har monist is not resting upon the precarious foundation of an editorial comment or gloss On the other hand the existence of isolated passages such as Isaiah lvi 18 or writings with a partly polemical purpose such as Jonah and Ruth suggest a doubt whether many noble utterances may not have been curtailed or suppressed by overzealous editors with whose religious position they were not in harmony The actual variety of thought in the Biblical writings in their present form may be roughly classified as follows First a variety that indicates and illustrates a development in time of moral and religious thought from lower to higher But within this category we cannot include all species of dif ference Nehemiah is later than the second Isaiah but he is spiritually his inferior Secondly a variety that is par tially explained by the fact that the authors of Scripture fall into three or four different classes The prophets the wise men the priests and the psalmists had all to some extent their own special points of view and there are writings in the Bible such as Deuteronomy or Ezekiel or Psalm cxix which represent a more or less perfect fusion between two of these different classes Lastly there remains all the variety that may be due to the individual idiosyncrasy and character of each particular writer K2 143The Jewi3shb Quarterly Reiielw I I propose to illustrate the many moods of the Scriptures by a few salient examples sufficiently familiar as they are to the scholar they still need interpretation to the general reader The variety which is mainly due to upward development is well shown in the progressive conceptions of God Monotheism in Israel did not spring full fledged into exis tence It was only gradually that the patron deity of the nation was transformed into the sole and only God in heaven and upon earth M Renan indeed would have us believe that among the old patriarchal ancestors of the Hebrews there was already prevalent a kind of primitive monotheism The namle less Elohim gods they worshipped were easily combinable into a single Elohim God  whose breath is the life of the universe The introduction of the worship of Yahveh as the national God was a downward religious step Centuries were needed before Yahveh the cruel jealous and partial Deity could be disrobed of his own peculiar attributes and endowed with the higher qualities of the patriarchal Elohim But M Renans theory is still unproved And seeing that it is inconsistent with the safest conclusions of comparative religious study we may abide in the belief that the pre Mosaic conception of deity of which Stade with perhaps too sweeping a negative declares that we know nothing was not higher than the Mosaic but lower2 and that the recognition of Yahveh as the sole God of Israel marks a gigantic religious advance Moreover the exclusive worship of Yahveh when once acknowledged as the religious duty of Israel became the steppingstone to monotheism It was the monolatry offered to Yahveh which turned the plurality of the word Elohim from a living reality into a mere grammatical archaism It seems strange and even sad that the two terms which the Jews the monotheists par excellence use to designate God should carry upon the face of them the evidence of a polytheis tic origin3 The very substitution of the true pronunciation Renan Jiistoire dIsrael Vol I Chapters iiiv which repeat his old theory of the primitive monotheism of the Semites in the famous

Queens Printters Bible a work which every general reader of the Bible as well as every scholar should possess A new and revised edition has just appeared 144Many Moods iz the Hebrew Scriptures Yahveh in the place of the old rendering Jehovah gives a pecu liar shock to our religious sentiment Jehovah by the lapse of ages and the influence of faith has almost become synony mous with God But when for that familiar and therefore unsuggestive word we read Yahveh we are painfully sensible of the inevitable implication Yahveh though perhaps ety nmologically and certainly historically at a comparatively early date a worthy and lofty designation for God is never theless only a proper name of the same class as the proper names of other gods of other nations A name is far remote from our conception of the Deity Naming implies particu larisation he who is the sole representative of his class stands in no need of having his identity secured by the help of a particular appellation Yet however much Yahveh in the eyes of a David or a Solomon was superior to other gods he was not regarded as the only Divine Power Yahveh had to pass from being the god of a tribe before being recog nized as the Universal Deity of all mankind It is natural that these lower conceptions as they peep out from the oldest historical records which even in their present form are in this respect still imperfectly edited should frequently present many unattractive features Upon these it is unnecessary to dwell in detail a few examples will serve our purpose sufficiently The localisation of Yahveh strikes us especially There are signs that he was first thought to reside habitually upon Mount Sinai while later Palestine becomes his permanent dwellingplace On this point it suffices merely to refer to such repeatedly quoted passages as 2 Samuel xiv 16 Exodus xv 17 Hosea ix 3 etc2 At other times the ark is superstitiously identified with God as in 1 Samuel vi cp Numbers x 3336 the ideas in which chapter may be contrasted both with Jeremiahs view of the ark iii 16 and with Gods residence by grace in the sanctuary at Jerusalem according to Ezekiel the Priester codex and the temple Psalms Heaven in which a modern childs faith localises God became his dwellingplace for the Hebrews also but at what date is uncertain For a later age heaven itself becomies unable to contain God and the Divine Compare Exodus xix 4 Deut xxxiii 2 and Dillmanns Commentary ad loc Judges v 4 etc Stade Geschichte Vol I p 447 Wellhausen Proleg p 344 ET 2 Compare now for the whole of this subject Robertson

than in Solomons Prayer 1 Kings viii 27 and Psalm cxxxix1 Jephtahs Yahveh in an illustrative but over emphasised passage Judges xi 24 Q P B is not conspicuously different in capacity and range of interest from the god of the Moabite stone Yet this is the Yahveh whose house shall be called an house of prayer for all peoples How great the change The spirit of the one Yahveh drives its possessor to slay a thousand of the Philistines Judges xv 15 the spirit of the other impels to preach good tidings to the meek and to bind up the brokenhearted Isaiah lxi 1 Still as these very extracts from the book of Isaiah prove it is Yahveh not Elohim of whom these things are said and Yahveh is not a mere synonym for God Yahveh is the God revealed in history or rather he is the God revealed in Israels history Israels God is the God of Prophecy not the more abstract if more philosophical God of humanity at large But it is clear that the conception of God in the books of the Wise indicates a different kind of religious progress to that achieved by the Prophets It does not affect the truth of this proposition that in Proverbs God is usually called Yahveh Though addressed under this name the God of Proverbs is not so much the God of Israel as the God of the individual or the world UJnfortunately the dates of both Job and Proverbs still remain uncertain The possible influence of the  Wise Men  upon the work of the Prophets must therefore also remain for the present a very doubtful quantity2 A certain lack of religious ardour seems traceable in the writings of the Wise In spite of the glorification of wisdom we seem to miss the intimacy of religious sentiment as expressed in many of the Psalms The Prophets were naturally more conscious of a close relationship to God Sentences like  I dwell with him that is of a humble and contrite spirit or  the Lord is nigh unto all them that call upon him seem more in place in Isaiah or the Psalms than they would be in Proverbs Job or Ecclesiastes It is probable that the lack of warmth and Innigkeit in the Preachers references to God is explainable from the temperament of the man and the sad circumstances of his age whereas in Job and Proverbs these deficiencies if they are more real than apparent are to be ascribed to the nature and limits of the class of literature to which they X It is therefore not true as Stade Gesc icltte Vol I p 467 would imply that Acts xvii 24 taught something till then unknown to any Jew 2 Cheyne Job and Solomon p 123 rates their influence high even in the preexilic period A very late date is given to Proverbs by Holtzmann Stades continuer and disciple in Gech ieltc II p 292 and by Stade himself p 216 146afany Moods in the Hebrewt Scriptures belong When however a very late date is assigned to Proverbs and Job as well as to the Preacher the lateness of whose age is certain the supposed lack of warmth in their conceptions of God becomes additionally important for it is then brought into connection with a general theory that has become a commonplace among most critical theologians The theory is that in proportion as the conception of Yahveh became purified from the earlier anthropomorphisms or speaking from a modern point of view as the change proceeded from Yahveh to Elohim God became more dis tant and transcendent and his relation to man colder and less intimate It is supposed that the change is first notice able in Ezekiel and that this false transcendentalism became more and more the customary and ordinary manner of conceiving God among the Scribes and  Pharisees The necessary corrective was then supplied so it is assumed by the life and teaching of Jesus and theologically at a later age by the theory of the three vTroacrael or Personce in the single Godhead Now I should be the last to deny that the idea of God formed by an ethical and religious genius of the first order such as Jesus was indefinitely higher and more intimate than could be formed by a far smaller per sonality such as the author of Ecclesiastes or of the book of Tobit Nor do I deny that the theory of the Trinity at a great sacrifice of the purity of the divine idea for nine tenths of those who have accepted it has kept in view and put prominently forward certain relations of the Deity to man and to the world without which the whole conception of God loses half its value and half its truth But it is I hope not merely an hereditary and therefore unconscious Jewish prepossession which makes me protest against the too fre quent habit of misusing and misinterpreting certain portions of the Old Testament and of the later Jewish literature as a contrast and foil to Christianity What a gratuitous unfairness it surely is when Professor Schultz after conceding that the conception of God in the apocryphal books is usually agreeably free from the crudities and sensuous forms which mar the purity of the older ideas goes on to say that this greater purity is in the last resort not the expression of a higher religious development but the result of spiritual exhaustion Schultz Alttestamentliche Theologie 4th edition p 507 This is a mere statement of opinion unsupported by evidence whereas that the intimate relation of God to Israel and even to every individual Israelite is a characteristic of the whole Talmudic period might be convincingly proved The false transcendentalism except perhaps in such writers as 147The Jewish Quarterly Review Koheleth or in regular philosophers like Philo is a figment of the theologians brains It is perfectly true that God is conceived as far removed from every human weakness or limitation and it is also true that he is distinguished from the world which he has created and rules but as to the first point it is surely not an error but a truth and as to the second it is the necessary characteristic of every simple faith whether Jewish or Christian No pantheistic God has ever received or will ever receive the prayer and worship of ordinary humanity Christian theologians usually write in compara tive unfamiliarity with the literature they specially decry they cannot work themselves into sympathy with its frequent strangeness of speech while they are still more unfamiliar with living specimens of piety bred and nurtured upon exclu sively Rabbinic lines Otherwise they would see for them selves that whatever may be the faults of the individual religion of people such as these lack of warmth and intimacy in their conception of and communion with God is certainly not among the number In another respect also the Talmudic idea of God is more akin to that of the Prophets than to that of Ecclesiastes By the author of Ecclesiastes so far as we can judge God was not habitually regarded as standing in a special relation to Israel he is Elohim not Yahveh To the Talmudists he is Yahveh still though they do not pronounce his name1 For us today the idea of God is not so easy We have to make his Elohin aspect the basis of our conception then only can we trans fuse it with all those essential qualities without their limita tions does not this roughly equal the substitution of mankind for Israel  that made the word Yahveh precious and signi ficant to the Psalmists and the Seers II The many moods of Scripture can also be illustrated by the varying conceptions of Gods relation to Israel and to other nations The ordinary preprophetic idea is aptly expressed by the passages in Judges and Samuel already alluded to It is the tolerant attitude of conventional paganism Each nation has its own special God and is thus religiously in The pronouncing Adonai for Yahveh is usually put down to a  Phari saic superstition If it be so we can be grateful to the superstition since a name for God had to be given up Yet since the basis of the alleged super stition is that Yahveh is not a mere name but expresses in a mysterious way the essence or true nature of God the  superstition is surely religiously higher than the frank utterance of Yahveh as an ordinary appellation 148Many Moods in the Hebreew Scripteures dependent of every other nation This view was even in later times shaken off with difficulty but its character was modified It then became a conscious dislike or neglect of the lofty Prophetic visionsa religious selfishness the other nations may worship their false gods if they please we will enjoy our privilege of adoring Yahveh the true God This is I fancy the thought expressed in a verse of Micah appended perchance as a side note or reflection by a narrow minded scribe to a solemn universalistic prophecy and then by a strange though not unusual fate incorporated into the text for all the peoples shall walk every one in the name of his God but we will walk in the name of Yahveh our God for ever and ever Micah iv 5 How are we to account on any nontheistic hypothesis for the extraordinary change from the conception of Jephtah to that of the Babylonian Isaiah  Did ever a God become so exclusively identified with a people did ever a people become so exclusively identified with a God as Yahveh with Israel and Israel with Yahveh Israel is Yahvehs particular people and Yahveh is their sole and particular God He is Israels pride and glory and in another sense his glory and pride are centred in Israel And yet out of this very particularism springs the universalism of the later Prophets How did this change come about Excluding the influence of external events the relations to Assyria and the other great monarchies of Asia its great internal cause lay in the peculiar character of the nations God as the best spirits of the people so far back as the eye of history can range conceived him Yahveh is a God of power and of jealousy he is greater than the other gods he cannot tolerate them beside him and so at last he comes to be the only God and all other divine powers in the universe are at most his ministers and attendants And secondly Yahveh is a God of righteousness and therefore whatever his relations to other peoples beyond Israel in present past or future they must be relations which are founded and shaped by the ruling law of righteousness That one God amlong many should become the patron deity of a single people presents no difficulty where a plurality of gods is assumed It is no hard matter that each deity looks after the interests of his own clients But a covenant or peculiar relation of grace between the only God on one side and a particular nation on the other is almost bound to pro duce its religious antinomies That the only God should single out one particular nation as his special property though leaving perchance the others to the care of his own angelic 149The Jewish Qicaterly levic servitorsl obviously demands some very peculiar and unusual explanation if it is to be adequately reconciled with divine impartiality Such an explanation could not be given to it so long as Israel was still a nation among the nations The idea of the covenant could only be stripped of its danger and yet maintain its value when the religious community took the place of the nation when Israelites became complete citizens of other lands than Palestine and when the altruistic view of Israels relation to God became finally predominant In other words the idea of the covenant could not be realised in all its purity until modern times That God and Israel are specially related to each other and that Israel if it observes the conditions of the agreement is to reap enormous benefit both temporal and spiritual from this relationship is a fundamental assumption of the Old Testament writers Why God chose Israel and for what end were naturally questions that did not very often suggest themselves to the national consciousness The covenant must be obeyed that its advantages might be enjoyed there was no need to question or explain If the nation had properly fulfilled its own part of the agreement the prophetical writers would scarcely have even thrown out the fragmentary ideas upon the subject that we can now discover Thus for in stance the benefits which God showered down upon an ungrateful people are sometimes ascribed to the excellence of the Patriarchs and to the necessity which God was under of fulfilling his word of promise to Abraham Isaac and Jacob Deuteronomy declares that it was not as a reward for righteousness that God had brought the Israelites in to possess Canaan but partly because of the wickedness of the Canaanite nations and partly as a confirmation of the oath to the fathers Deut ix 4 compare Genesis xv 16 In another passage the author asserts that Gods choice of Israel was made because he loved him In a far later teacher the choice comes dangerously near to caprice Was not Esau Jacobs brother yet I loved Jacob and hated Esau  Malachi i 22 Far nobler is the explanation of Exodus xix 6 Ye shall be unto me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation These words seem almost to imply that the election of Israel is for the good of others as well as for his own Equally Compare Deut xxxii 8 in the LXX reading Dillmann however Nu Dt Jo p 398 denies the originality of this reading and thinks the whole idea much later Compare also Stade Vol II p 239 and Cheyne on Isaiah xxiv 21 2 Contrast with Malachis hatred of Edom the kindlier feeling of the Deut eronomist ii 5 8 29 xxiii 7 and compare Schulz p 748 fourth edition 150Many loods in the Hebrew Scriptures noble are the words of Genesis xviii 19 where a moral purpose is clearly assigned to Israels prerogative I have taken notice of him Abraham that he may command his children and his household after him so that they keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment In the Babylonian Isaiah there are three reasons given for Israels primacy The first is the reason of all things the glory of God who by the witnessing of Israel and his apostolic services is exalted among mankind Secondly comes Israel itself and its own future grandeur The Covenant is a gift of grace bringing a rich guerdon with it And lastly the election of Israel or rather of the servant in whom all that is best in Israel is personified is for the worlds sake Israel is to be a light to the nations and Gods salvation unto the end of the earth I admit that this method of explaining Israels special rela tion to God is elsewhere unparalleled but none the less isolated as the explanation is it has triumphed over all lower ideas and unquestionably represents today the ripened doc trine of the synagogue The older prophets do not generally concern themselves with other nations except in so far as these are related to Israel Here it is that the religious danger comes in When for example one nation is at war with the other each always thinks itself in the right and even in modern times demands the special protection of God In old Israel this natural feeling implied much more In the last resort it implied that as Yahveh must be on the side of Israel in doing in jury to Israel the offending nation had also sinned against Yahveh It is unnecessary to quote examples of so familiar a theme Even Babylon the minister of Gods wrath upon Judah was supposed to have sinned against Yahveh because she not unnaturally imagined that her own strength had wrought the victory During and after the exile the enmity to the nations deepens Before that time the prophets mainly if not exclusively2 directed their denunciations against certain definite countries but afterwards Ezekiel being here as in so many other things the pioneer of later developments the nations as a collective plural became identified with the enemies of Israel The Israelites in the later mainly Maccabean psalms are the righteous the The date of Genesis xviii 19 and xv 16 is disputed See Dillmann Gewusis fifth edition upon the former passage Stade notoriously regards an allusion to  many nations as an almost certain mark of a later authorship Compare his essays in his Zcitsckhiftj upon Zech ixxiv Micah ivvii etc and Ryssels Micah 151The Jewish Quarterly Review nations  are the wicked The Lords day is to be ushered in by an awful judgment upon the nations the enemies of God and of his chosen people This punishment of the nations which according to the principle of righteous retribution must be caused by their sinfulness is partly accounted for by their hostility to Israel This however is not the only cause which is men tioned Their very ignorance of the true God is made a re proach against them Idolatry is not only a sin in Israel but also in the nations at large So in a probably unauthentic passage in Jeremiah the fury of Yahveh is invoked upon the nations that know him not and upon the families that call not on his name The view that idolatry is conscious apostasy is cleverly elaborated in the Wisdom of Solomon xiii and xiv On the other hand Amos the oldest of the literary prophets bases the ruin of Moab upon an act of barbarism committed not upon Israel but upon Edom To him apparently the nations ignorance of Yahveh is no offence though all peoples are under Gods immediate providence Are ye not as the children of the Ethiopians unto me 0 children of Israel  saith the Lord Have I not brought up Israel out of the land of Egypt and the Philistines from Caphtor and the Syrians from Kir  ix 7 How powerful must have been the force of religious inspi ration for a prophet in the midst of the strife with Assyria to imagine and predict a time when Assyria now Israels foe and therefore Gods should be called the work of the Lords hands Isaiah xix 25 The tender care for the stranger manifested in all three great strata of Pentateuchal legisla tion in spite of Stades sneer Vol I p 510 n 3 together with the varying pictures of the conversion of the nations to the knowledge of God must always remain sufficient evidence of the largeness of heart and view to which the old Israelite religion could rise Side by side too with the particularist efforts of Ezra and his school ran another feeling which found expression partly perhaps in directly polemical utter ances such as Jonah Isaiah lvi 18 and Ruth but also in several of the Psalms the writers of which were at the same time very probably the faithful followers of the Law Com pare Psalm lxxxvii xxii 28 etc The philosophic interpretation of Malachi i 11 seems to me too strangely unusual to be safely cited as one of the many moods of the prophets upon this subject Would that this doubt did not exist It should however be stated that Kuenen Stade and many other scholars accept it while Cheyne in his article The Invisible Church in Hebrew Prophecy Monthly Inter preter 1885 p 77 regards it as the only tenable  explanation 152Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures It must also be remembered that the universalist side of Judaism is not forgotten even in the Rabbinic literature The ascription of the cause of the dispersion to the making of proselytes and the beautiful if childlike image of God weep ing over the drowned Egyptians and chiding his angels for their song of triumph are certainly far overbalanced by other opposite passages but comparatively few as these universalist sayings may be they yet kept the light from being quenched and thus helped forward the coming of the time when the universalism of the prophets purified from its dross and separated from its merely local and temporary elements should become an unquestioned constituent of Judaism III In most books of the Old Testament God and Israel are the two poles of the religious idea with us they are God and man This difference is commonly made much of in books on Old Testament theology but here again we must beware of exaggeration It is quite true that the relation of God to each human soul which to us seems the very kernel of religion is far less accentuated in the older books of the Scriptures than in modern times or even than in the New Testament The individual recedes behind the community it is Israel as an abiding whole which is of first importance not the single units who appear upon the stage only to vanish from off it Israels religious value consists in its con tinuity and selfidentity from age to age There is some thing sublime in that complete assimilation of personal interests with those of the conmmunity which as it would now seem has enabled so many of the Psalmists personifications to escape detection froml the majority of critics up till the present day Yet though the command to love God is addressed to Israel as a whole each single member of the nation is personally bound by the mandate and though all the Psalms be  national no Psalmist speaks of sorrows joys or desires which he has not himself personally experienced At the same time it must be conceded that the personifica tion of a community in antiquity is a very different thing from a mere poetical figure The solidarity is so real that it Compare Smend Ueber das Ich der Psalmen Z A W 1888 p 49ff The personification theory is however a return to the old homiletic interpreta tion of the Synagogue Smend probably rides his hobby too hard Compare Nowacks judicious remarks in the Einleitung to his new edition of Hupfelds Psalms p x and SchuurmanStekhoven in Z A W 1889 p 131 153The Jetwish Quarterly Review carries with it most important consequences and when re flection begins suggests many a moral problem Upon the assumed solidarity of a city or nation the Deity is frequently supposed to act in the earlier periods This solida rity extends from the dead to the living and exercises its in fluence in the direction of mercy as well as in that of punish ment I need not multiply examples Ten good men would be sufficient to procure forgiveness for all Sodoin For the sins of Manasseh the captivity is predicted upon his descen dants David sins and his child dies He is tempted to number Israel and a plague kills many thousands of the people Ahaz is penitent and his punishment is postponed for his son Another plague is due to Sauls cruelty against the Gibeonites and the execution of Sauls sons becomes its expiation Sin accumulates generation by generation The ages that had to elapse till the Canaanites measure of guilt was full and till the fated season of their punishment had arrived needed the lengthy sojourning of the Israelites in Egypt2 Such is tlle Divine Law For God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon the third and fourth generations of those that hate him But love extends its influence yet further for God  shows mercy to the thousandth generation of those that love him3 In after years when the nation was becoming weary and saddened under oppression and trouble the weight of the fathers sins seemed a burden too hard to bear Indivi dualism was awakening even in its denial  Our fathers have eaten sour grapes men said  and the childrens teeth are set on edge Then came the Deuteronomist Jeremiah and Ezekiel and they declared that individualism was the proper law of punishment both for God and man4 The soul that sinneth it shall die The son shall not bear in Q P B the iniquity of the father neither shall the father bear in the iniquity of the son the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him 1 David is however made to suggest that the solidarity ought not to extend beyond his own house These sheep what have they done  2 Samuel xxiv 17 2 Compare also 2 Samuel iii 29 xii 10 1 Kings ii 33 xi 12 2 Kings v 27 viii 19 x 30 xiii 23  2 Chron xxi 14 Isaiah xiv 21 Jer xxxii 18 Lev xx 5 Job v 4 xxi 19  Psalm lxxix 8 cix 14 Neh i 6 Daniel ix 16 3 The Deuteronomist is bound to quote the second commandment as he found it but his own view is not only given in xxiv 16 but also in vii 9 10 Gods mercy extends to a thousand generations but those that hate him he repays to their face 4 Yet it must be noted that Jeremiah strictly only asserts that the proverb shall have no force or truth in the Messianic age 154Manly Moods in the H1ebew Scriptres It cannot be said however that individualism ever became a significant feature of the old Hebrew religion Where as in the Psalms there is the intensest religious feeling it is nevertheless if critics such as Smend see rightly experienced in close connection with the whole community Take Psalm li for instance It is quite certain that the Psalmist tells the lessons of his own life but at the same time verse 6 Heb makes it clear that a national reference is also intended The wisdom literature is far more individual and yet its degree of religious intensity is lower The priestly legislation recognises the solidarity of the community in a marked manner by the institution of the national sil offering The idea conveyed in the old story of Achan by which the sin of a single man spreads its fatal influence more and more widely till it taints with the pollution of its guilt the entire people was only very gradually overcome There is indeed no deeper problem in the philosophy of religion than the nature of sin It is thus no wonder if the usually sillple utterances of the Old Testament writers illustrate several different sides of this complex question Here again there are many moods whether all the elements of truth can be brought together under a single conception that shall be universally true and explain equally for each human soul the nature of his sin may however be doubted Theories of sin such as the theory of St Paul are not even if true for many necessarily true for all Apart from the allegory in Genesis ii there is no theory of the origin of sin to be found in the Old Testa ment and tlat chapter seems to have had no influence whatever upon later teaching Man who is flesh and not spirit is liable to error and wrong doing  There is no man that sinneth not Such is the general view Jeremiah indeed thought that there was an inherent deceitfulness about the heart a sore sickness which God alone could cure Jer xvii 9 14 x 23 The direful consequences of sin led to the mistaken1 view that there was something almost super natural about it as if sin were a kind of eternal power which God may use as a snare to bring about a greater punishment The tendency towards solidarity comes in once more The sins of one generation seemed a force that created sinfulness in the next one link of sin bringing with it another Traces 1 Theologians seem sometimes to speak of sin as Realist philosophers used to speak of kindsas something real over and above the particular sins of individuals Unless we believe in a devil this idea is surely a fiction Yet Holtzmann Stade II p 304 commenting on Sirach xvii 20 seems to accept it 155The Jewcish Quarterly Review of these views together with renlonstrances against them are to he found Thus to an early writer in the books of Samuel the sin of David in numbering the people seemed due to the direct temptation of God 2 Samuel xxiv 1 The Chronicler long afterwards was willing to believe that the sin was caused by supernatural influence the agent however is no longer God but Satan 1 Chronicles xxi 1 The hardening of Pharaohs heart and of Sihons Deut ii 30 is scarcely in point because it was done for the benefit of Israel compare Joshua xi 20 But an interesting verse in Isaiah lxiii is very significant as showing the per plexity into which longlasting affliction half deserved and half wanton had thrown many a troubled spirit in the exile period  O Lord why dost thou make us to err from thy ways and harden our hearts from thy fear The text of Isaiah lxiv 5 is unfortunately corrupt but seems to imply the idea that by its long continuance from age to age sin had become a kind of chain in which the wrath of God had fettered the community and from the bonds of which they could not shake themselves free More simple is the expression in Lamentations v 7 Our fathers have sinned and are not and we have borne their iniquities And even the prediction in Lev xxvi an exilic chapter with marked affinities to Ezekiel accepts this sombre belief They that are left of you shall pine away for their iniquity in your enemies lands and also for the iniquities of their fatlhers with them ie as well as of themselves QPB shall they pine away Ezekiel on the other hand whose strong accentuation of mans free capacity to turn from good to bad and from bad to good brings other difficulties in its train rebukes with a noble scorn the dark superstition that the curse of God is the origin of sin His contemporaries had used the same argument as we find in Isaiah lxiii If our transgressions and our sins are upon us and we pine away in them how then should we live  xxxiii 10 Ezekiel replies that God has no pleasure in the death of the wicked a man has only to turn from his evil ways that he may live The prophet is clearly of opinion first that there is no divine or satanic power which impels a man to sin and secondly that in the moral sphere each man can act independently of his community and even of his parents There is no constraining force which induces sin and punishment apart from a mans own will Whereas the popu lar view represented also in the quotation from Leviticus But compare Ezekiel xxiv 23 156Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures regards the sin of a community as a sort of spiritual snowball sin begets sin and the amount is accumulated generation after generation till at last it seems impossible for the bearers of this heaped up store of iniquity to rid themselves of the burden Ezekiel repudiates this doctrine according to his teaching in the 18th and 33rd chapters of his book each man starts his life with a blank judgment sheet his fathers sins are not laid to his account and they do not lessen his capacity for a righteous life Into the nature of sin the Hebrew writers and preachers enquired as little curiously as they did into its oligin Sin to them is simply a transgression of Gods will or commandments To the prophets Gods injunctions are twofold they forbid idolatry they enjoin morality The Law extended the range of sin much more widely to eat fat is as much a sin as to commit adultery Hence the introduction of the Law deve loped the idea of secret or unconscious sins errors into which a man might fall without his knowledge a conception entirely foreign to the earlier prophets But with this increase in the range of sin and under the current conception that misfor tune was equivalent to punishment it became all the more usual in times of trouble to bewail the iniquities the commission of which must have caused the distress A different mood on the other hand is discernible in some of the Maccabean psalms there the  Saints the aNvron in whose mouth is a hymn to God in whose hand a twoedged sword cxlix are not conscious of any defiling guilt They complain All this is come upon us yet have we not forgotten thee neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant Not for their sins but yet for Gods sake are they killed all the day long xliv 22 How is a sinful man or a sinful community to become free from sin Here again there are divers moods to be recorded The primary view is that man must and can turn from the wickedness of his ways and rid himself of his sin Wash you make you clean cries Isaiah Put away tlle evil of your doings from before mine eyes cease to do evil learn to do well The Prophet does not imagine that there is any thing to prevent his hearers from ceasing to do evil and learning to do well if they please And exhortations of this kind are not foreign to any period of the prophetical ministry Every preacher will naturally urge his audience to struggle for their own amendment and none would deny that such struggles may be crowned with success At the same time Compare Daniel ix 5 Neh i 6 Psalm cvi 6 L 157The Jewish Quarterly Review the idea that it is in mans unaided power to pass from sin to virtue was to some extent checked in certain minds and at certain periods by two important considerations The first of these we have noticed already It is that each unit is one of a community and shares in that communitys sin and perhaps also in the sin of its forefathers The weight of sin which the individual feels attached to himself is thereby greatly in creased and the difficulty to be rid of it is also correspond ingly augmented Secondly the conception of sin was deepened and passed into that of sinfulness that is to say it seemed to some minds as if the sinful nature which had been produced by sin could not be cleansed by the human will alone When the set of the soul was directed towards wrong doing it could not by its own effort unhelped by an outside and diviner power be turned in the contrary direction Hence perhaps it may be explained that we find traces of a feeling that the thorough eradication of sin must be Gods work and not mans This view is chiefly promi nent in passages dating from the exile and dealing with the messianic age as if the writers felt that the spiritual regeneration of Israel as well as the material regeneration of nature must need the special intervention of God The illustrative passages come from Deuteronomy Jeremiah and Ezekiel and are all very much of the same kind They are often placed in curious juxtaposition with other passages in which the same spiritual changes in the heart which in the first series are ascribed to God are there demanded from the unaided effort of man Jeremiah xxiv 7 predicts that God will give Israel one heart to know him he will cleanse them from their iniquity xxxiii 8 and put his teaching in their inward parts and write it on their hearts xxxi 33 Ezekiel also foretells the granting of one heart and a new spirit a time when the stony heart shall be removed and a heart of flesh given in its place Then shall the people be able to walk in the ordinances of their God xi 19 20 The new spirit is Gods spirit the spirit of true life xxxvi 26 xxxvii 14 Yet at the end of his eighteenth chapter he urges the people to get this new heart for themselves  Cast away from you all your transgressions whereby ye have transgressed and make you a new heart and a new spirit for why will ye die O house of Israel Are we to assume that the Prophet passed from one to another of these utterances without being aware of any contrariety between them and that at one time the one and at a second time the other of two apparently but no really conflicting sides of a complex truth was more vividly present to his 158Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures mind  With these passages in Ezekiel and Jeremiah may be compared the messianic prediction of Zephaniah which takes a wider range than Israel Then will I turn to the peoples a pure language that they may all call upon the name of the Lord to serve him with one consent In a verse of Deuteronomy the aid of God seems promised to crown the human effort with a more glorious issue If so runs the prediction in xxx 4 a chapter clearly considerably later than the main bulk of the Deuteronomy of Josiah  thou shalt return  ie in the land of captivity unto the Lord thy God and shalt obey his voice with all thine heart and with all thy soul  then verse 6 the Lord thy God will circumcise thine heart and the heart of thy seed to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all thy soul that thou mayest live All these passages are messianic But there are a few others mainly in the Psalms which show that even for the present and every day life of the community the divine help was thought by some in the postexilic period chiefly to be needful for the living of a good life and for the con quest over sin Shew me thy way  teach me to do thy will are not unfrequent prayers in the Psalter compare xxv 5 xxvii 11 cxliii 10 cxxxix 24 etc 1 Ch xxix 18 19 is also of value More significant still is the bidding let me not wander from thy command or hold thou me up and I shall be safe cxix 10 117 The double aspect of the human relation with God is mystically expressed in Psalm Ixiii 9 My soul followeth hard after thee thy right hand upholdeth me Noticeable are the prayers in Jere miah and Lamentations Heal me O Lord and I shall be healed save me and I shall be saved Jeremiah xvii 14 Turn thou us unto thee O Lord and we will return Lamentations v 21 compare Jeremiah xxxi 19 Psalm lxxx and lxxxv 51 It is a development of the doctrine implied in the prayer of Lamentations if we find it stated in Jeremiah 0 Lord I know that the way of man is not in himself it is not for man that walketh to direct his steps x 23 or again in I Upon Psalm lxxxv 5 the Midrash in a passage quoted and improved upon by Dr Frankl in one of his sermons moralises thus  The sons of Korah said  How long wilt thou say to Israel Turn O backsliding children Jere miah iii 14 and shall Israel say to thee Turn thou first as it is said Return O Lord how long Psalm xc 13 and wilt thou say to Israel Nay turn ye first as it is said O Israel return unto the Lord thy God Hosea xiv 1 thou wilt not turn by thyself and we will not turn by ourselves but let us both turn together and at once as it is said Turn thou with us O God of our sal vation Frankl Fest zind Gelqeen1keitsPrediten 1888 p 31 The Midrash Tillim ad loc translates 115W  Turn thou with us L 2 159The Jewish Quarterly Revieic Proverbs Mans goings are of the Lord how can a man then understand his own way   xx 24 Here the cry fol help that meets us in Lamentations seems turning into a kind of restrictive fatalism What is true without exaggeration in living experience seems onesided and doubtful when twisted into a theory This could even happen in the case of the noble Psalm li with its almost unique prayer for the help of Gods holy spirit in the struggle with sin The view that sin is not to be overcome without that divine aid has never been expressed more purely or with intenser conviction  Purge me with hyssop and I shall be clean wash me and I shall be whiter than snow Create in me a clean heart O God and renew a firm spirit within me Cast me not away from thy presence and take not thy holy spirit from me The labels  good  and  sinful are applied in different ages to different deeds The preprophetic period ie the period before Amos though we may I think rightly refuse to believe that Stades too depreciatory estimate of it is correct1 possessed even in the minds of zealous Yahveh worshippers such as Elijah a lower ideal than that of an Isaiah or a Micah Thus the cruelties of Jehu which God is made tc sanction and approve in 2 Kings x 30 are become such an abomination to Hosea that for their sake the whole kingdom of Israel is to be visited with ruin In a tradition respecting Samuel the utter destruction of the Amalekites is the divine command deflection from which is a grievous sin in Jonah the very cattle the saving of which Samuel censures in Gods name are a reason for God to spare the Ninevites fiom de struction2 A variety of mood of extreme importance is roughly characterised by the opposition between the prophets and the Law in regard to external and internal religion or more accurately in their respective attitudes towards cere monial observances To estimate this difference truly and yet without exaggeration it is necessary to remember the date at which the Law became an important factor in the religious life of Israel Up to the time when Deuteronomy was accepted by Josiah Gese ickte Vol I p 573  Compare too the different views of the monarchy in 1 Samuel To the  theocratic chronicler the kingdom was a desertion from God and a grievous sin to the older narrator it was a meritorious unification of the tribes Though usually the kingdom of the Ten Tribes is regarded as the illegitimate result of a rebellion against the divinely appointed house of David one passage at least from the pen of an Ephraimite still records for us the other side of the question  Hear Yahveh the voice of Judah and bring him back unto his people  Deut xxxiii 17 with Dillmanns commentary 160Many Mloods in the Hebrew Scriptures as the binding law for the individual and the state the teachers of Israel under the monarchy may have shown some respect towards the holy customs of antiquity but were unaware of the existence of any authoritative code claiming a divine sanction It does not appear as if the small Book of the Covenant Exodus xxixxiii or the laws contained in Exodus xxxiv were ever publicly recognised as bind ing till they were absorbed and modified by Deuteronomy Thus up till the date of that books composition and pub lication the prophets that is such men as Amos Hosea and Isaiah sought no other or higher guide for their teach ing than their own inspiration Jeremiah a contemporary of the Deuteronomist seems to take up a varying attitude towards his book At first he may have hoped that great things would follow from its adoption The Covenant men tioned in his eleventh chapter disobedience against which is threatened with a curse seems to refer to Deutero nomy1 But very shortly the prophet in his zeal for the unattainable ideal must have perceived that the compro mise of Deuteronomy produced no better fruits than the unalloyed moral teaching of his prophetic predecessors No prophet has spoken out more vehemently against the value and even the validity of sacrifices than Jeremiah The ark of the covenant is to be forgotten and never made again the temple of the Lord is no safeguard against the coming ruin Contrast this with Isaiahs secure trust in the inde structibility of Jerusalem and of the temple upon Zion There is not so much about sacrifices in Deuteronomy as in the later priestly legislation but yet the perfect Israelite of Deuteronomy could certainly not neglect these outward exhi bitions of piety However we may try to soften the meaning of Jeremiahs words they sound strangely in contrast with many a verse of Josiahs code Deuteronomy be it remem bered represents its legislation as Mosaic I spake not unto your fathers nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt concerning burnt offerings or sacrifices How utterly impossible such a sen tence would be in any writer after Nehemiah Ezekiel here as elsewhere represents an intermediate stage between the earlier prophets and the later Law He does not refer to an authoritative Mosaic code but he lays stress upon matters of ritual and purity and devotes many chapters of his book to new laws for future use respecting the priests the temple I See Cheyne Jeremiah p 56 167 Marti Der Prophet Jercmia voI Anatot p 17 161The Jewish Quarterly Review and the sacrifices After the return while we find Haggai urging the rebuilding of the sanctuary Zechariah high as is the place he assigns to Joshua the high priest gives the true prophets answer to the enquiry as to the fasts and their con tinuance Some twenty years after Zechariah comes the work of Ezra and his school the introduction of the Law and its perfervid adoption as the final and authoritative code of God How the Law or Pentateuch for all the parts of the socalled five books of Moses were now at last welded together into a single whole was able so admirably to win the devoted affection of the people at large how it became gradually identified with the entire religion of Israel and unquestionably accepted as Mosaic from end to end this is not the place to enquire But the final exhortation of Malachi represents the accomplishment of this process and with its entirely new appeal to the written Mosaic Law unnamed before by the whole series of Malachis predecessors it sounds the death knell of prophecy The written Law of God rendered the spoken message from him unnecessary The Pentateuch as we now possess it is a kind of com promise between the natural desire of man for an external embodiment of religion and the prophets too difficult identification of it with the doing of justice the love of  mercy and the walking humbly before God The dangers to which the Law led cannot here be pointed out nor on the other hand can I attempt a defence of the legal school from the unfair attacks to which they are too commonly subjected by Christian theologians Levitical or Rabbinical religion is a theory of religion and is therefore not without its moral risks Pauline religion is also a theory of religion and has equally its moral dangers The religion of the prophets and the religion of Jesus are not theories they are natural immediate and inspired But by the masses of the people theories of religion are most easily followed Hence the success of Rabbinism and Paulinism alike But just as it is unfair to judge Paulinism from the excesses of Antino mians so is it equally unfair to judge Rabbinism from the bad Pharisees who were attacked by Jesus2 A few examples of spiritual moods that have their roots in the Law are not without their interest Professor Smend I Notice how the tests of a good life include at least one matter of Sitte elevated into a mark of outward religious purity Ezekiel xviii 6 compare Lev xviii 19 xx 18 2 Whether they were as bad as Jesus in his zeal imagined may however be doubted similarly in the case of the  false prophets and Jeremiah Com pare also Wellhausens Die Pharisder und die Saducier p 127 one of this authors innumerable brilliant and telling passages 162Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures has recently pointed out the important place occupied by the temple in a large portion of the Psalter1 It is curious to note how some of the noblest spiritual passages in the Psalms are connected with the love of the temple upon the hill of Zion All such psalms are doubtless postexilic Sometimes Professor Smend has I think narrowed the House of God too exclu sively to the material temple where a higher meaning is intended but even these passages start from the temple made by hands though they rise to the larger sanctuary that is not2 Psalms lxv lxxxiv lxiii and xlii for example should be studied in this connection Psalm cxix and the second portion of Psalm xix are interesting specimens of the high spiritual influence which the Law could exercise upon many a pious believer How entirely these Psalms demolish the theory of the bondage of the Law And the Talmud if the Rabbins had only been more poetical would assuredly have been full of similar hymns The true disciple of the Rabbins has always managed to transfigure the most external and uninteresting prescripts of the Law with a spiritual light which no one at all infected with the spirit of criticism can ever hope to see or even adequately to understand3 V A simple piety even at the end of the nineteenth century can find all the religious ideas which are precious to it within the Old Testament literature Those who are unable to achieve a similar amount of Hineinlesen must content them selves with the view that no book can contain complete religious perfection because religion like all other partly human creations is subject to the law of development They will not on the other hand foolishly attempt to run counter to the highest wisdom of mankind in spiritual things by seeking to minimise the value of conceptions which in their fuiness are foreign to the Old Testament thinkers or which perchance have been largely accentuated in one form or another by an alien or younger creed On the contrary any germs of these ideas now precious to ourselves as well as to Smend Ueber die Bedeutung des Jerusalemischen Tempels etc Studien 2ind Kritiken 1884 p 704 2 Compare Mystic Passages in the Psalms Jeiish Quarterly Review Vol I p 143 3 Another curious instance of a mood that lies between legalism and  prophetism is a passage in the postexilic Joel  Turn ye to me with all your hearts anld withlfasting and with weepling and with smiting of the breast But the next verse begins Rend your heart and not your garments 163The Jewish Quarterly Review civilisation at large that we may discover in the Old Testa ment scriptures we shall hail with satisfaction It is a false charge brought against the Old Testament religion that it is eudaemonistic or utilitarian All theistic reli gions must be to some extent eudaemonistic because they must all believe that God in the last resort proportions reward to desert according to some law of justice It makes no difference whether the reward is expected in this world or in another The eudaemonism is just the same Jesus would not have said Rejoice and be exceeding glad when men revile you and persecute you if he could not have added in the same breath for great is your reward in heaven On the other hand the virtue and duty of selfsacrifice are not so plainly taught in the Old Testament scriptures as we should teach them in any handbook of practical ethics which we might compile today The comparative absence of this teaching is connected with the general view that suffering and misfortune are always evils and this view again is doubtless partly dependent upon the want of any belief in a happy or compensatory future life Yet even here there are indications of another  mood That suffering may discipline is indicated more than once  Happy says Eliphaz is the man whom God correcteth Job v 17  My son so runs the exhortation of the wise man despise not the chastening of the Lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the Lord loveth he cor recteth even as a father the son in whom he delighteth Proverbs iii 11 12 compare Deut viii 5 Happy is the man whom thou chastenest exclaims one Psalmist and another trained as we must remember under the Law is glad for his sorrow because before I was afflicted I went astray but now I have kept thy word Psalm cxix 67 71 compare Lam iii 27 Sacrifice for religions sake was illus triously shown in the days of Antiochus and the revolt of the Maccabees when as the Psalmist complains God seemed to have cast off and put to shame and yet for his sake his faithful servants were killed all the day long Psalm xliv 22 And finally the conception of labour suffering and death for the sake of others is luminously set forth in the picture of the suffering servant who takes upon himself the ins of others No passage in any literature has had I should imagine an influence at all comparable to that of the fifteen verses in Isaiah which describe the servants office and suffering his death and his triumph It always seems to me an unfortunate thing that the ideas contained in tlat chapter and in the few cognate verses elsewhere xlii 17 xlix 17 164Many Moods in the Hebrew Scriptures 165 1 46 should have been so strangely neglected by all later stages of Judaism and that it should have been reserved for the founder and teachers of Christianity to raise them to their proper level of importance among the spiritual posses sions of mankind The growth of the doctrine both of the resurrection of the body and the immortality of the soul must be sought in the large blank page between the Old Testament and the New It is only the beginnings of these beliefs which we can find in the older Scriptures These beginnings such as the out look upon an indefinitely prolonged life in communion with God as we find it in Psalms xlix lxxii and xvi the doubt ful allusions in Ecclesiastes the fuller teaching of a resur rection in Daniel and the prophecy of deaths annihilation and the quickening of the dead in those four mysterious and very late chapters of Isaiah xxivxxviil need not be quoted here in detail When hopes and glimpses such as these met and mingled with the Platonic teaching of im mortality it was not unlikely strange though the union was that spiritual fruit of costly price would be its issue And such fruit we find in that curious product of JewishAlexan drian

All animal and vegetable substances contain fixed air ibid No reason to think that any fixed air is produced by phlogistication p 120 Nor by burning of sulphur or phosphorus p 121 Unsuccessful attempts to discover what becomes of the air lost by phlogistication p 123126 Account of two experiments of Mr Warltires related by Dr Priestley p 126 Table of the result the bulk of the inflammable air being expressed in decimals of the common air p 127 Examination of the nature of the dew which lined the glass globe p 128 Which is all pure water p 129 Examination of the nature of the matter condensed on fiting a mixture of dephlogisticated and inflammable air ibid Phlo gisticated air appears to be nothing else than the nitrous acid united to phlogiston p 135 The great probability that dephlogisticated and phlogisticated air are distinct sub stances as supposed by M Lavoisier and Scheele p 141 Enquiry in what manner nitrous and vitriolic acids act in producing dephlogisticated air p 143 Different manner in which the acid acts in producing dephlogisticated air from red precipitate and from nitre p 146 Vegetables seem to consist almost intirely of fixed and phlo V O L LXXIV U u u gisticated508 inferredgisticatedinferred air p 148 Manner in which Mr Cavendish would explain most of the phaenomena of nature on Mr Lavoisiers principle of entirely discarding phlogiston c p 150153 Air Remarks on Mr Cavendishs experiments on air in a letter from Richard Kirwan Esq p 154 Experiments selected from Dr Priestley to prove that fixed air is some how or other produced in phlogistic processes either by separation or composition ibid Of the calcination of metals p 155161 Of the decomposition of nitrous air by mixture with common air p 161164 Of the diminution of common air by the electric spark p 164 Of the diminution of common air by the amalgama tion of mercury and lead p 165 Of the diminution of respirable air by com bustion p 166169  Answer to Mr Kirwans Remarks upon the Experiments on Air by Henry Cavendish Esq p 170 Result of an experiment of Mr de Lassones made with the filings of zinc digested in a caustic fixed alkali ibid Remarks thereon p 171 See Metals Experiments to determine if fixed air is generated by a mixture of nitrous and common air p 172 173 Curious experiment of Mr Kirwans p 174 Observation on an experiment of Dr Priestleys with a mixture of red precipi tate and iron filings ibid The argument on this subject summed up p 175 The generation of fixed air not the general effect of phlogisticating air p 177  Reply to Mr Cavendishs Answer by Richard Kirwan Esq p 178 Answer to Mr Cavendishs remarks on Mr Lassones experiment with filings of zinc digested in a caustic fixed alkali ibid Ditto to his observations on the calcination of lead ibid Extract of Dr Priestleys letter concerning the black powder which he formed out of an amalgam of mercury and lead p 179 Fixed air produced by the distillation of red precipi tate and the filings of iron cannot be attributed to the decomposition of the plum bago contained in the iron ibid Mr Cavendishs experiment of the nitrous sele nites absorbing fixed air just and agreeable to Mr Kirwans p 180 The perma nence of a mixture of nitrous and common air made over mercury not to be attri buted to common vapour ibid  Thoughts on the constituent Parts of Water and of dephlogisticated Air with an Account of some Experiments on that Subject in a letter from Mr James Watt Engineer p 329 The authors reasons for delaying the publication of his senti ments on this subject p 330 Observations on the constituent parts of inflammable air ibid Effects of mixing together certain proportions of pure dry dephlogisti cated air and of pure dry inflammable air in a strong glass vessel closely shut set on fire by the electric spark p 331 332 See Cavendish Humor or dephlogisticated water has a more powerful attraction for phlogiston than it has for latent heat but cannot unite with it at least not to the point of saturation or to the total expulsion of the heat unless first made redhot or nearly so p 334 A mixture of dephlo gisticated and inflammable air will remain for years in close vessels in the common heat of the atmosphere without any change and be as capable of deflagration as when509 when first shut up ibid Accounted for by Dr Priestley ibid The author aban dons the opinion that air is a modification of water p 335 In every case wherein dephlogisticated air has been produced substances have been employed some of whose constituent parts have a strong attraction for phlogiston p 336 Phaenomena observed from combinations of the nitrous acids with earths from which the dephlo gisticated air is obtained with less heat than from nitre itself p 338 Experiment to examine whether the phlogiston was furnished by the earths p 339 Ditto to deter mine whether any part of the acid entered into the composition of the air ibid Ditto to determine the quantity of acid in the receiving water and in the sublimate p 341 Ditto of the distillation of dephlogisticated air from cubic nitre in a glass vessel p 342 If any of the acid of the nitre enters into the composition of the dephlogisticated air it is a very small part and it rather seems that the acid or part of it unites itself so firmly to the phlogiston as to lose its attraction for water p 344 Any acid which can bear a red heat may perhaps concur in the production of dephlogisticated air ibid Dephlogisticated air obtained from the pure calces of metals may be attributed to the calces themselves ibid General reasoning on the subject p 346 Mr Scheeles hypothesis p 347 The heat extricated during the combustion of inflammable and dephlogisticated air is much greater than it appears to be p 348 By an experiment of Dr Priestleys it appears that nitre can pro duce onehalf of its weight of dephlogisticated air p 349 Dephlogisticated air in uniting to the phlogiston of sulphur produces as much heat as in uniting with the phlogiston of phosphorous ibid Dephlogisticated air unites completely with about twice its bulk of the inflammable air from metals ibid Experiments by Mess Lavoisier and De la Place p 350 The union of phlogiston in different propor tions with dephlogisticated air does not extricate different quantities of heat ibid Charcoal according to Dr Priestley when freed from fixed air and other air which it imbibes from the atmosphere is almost wholly convertible into phlogiston p 351 Enquiry whether all the heat let loose in these experiments was contained in the dephlogisticated air p 352 Not to be answered without many new experi ments p 353 Air Sequel to the foregoing Paper in a subsequent letter from the same p 354 Cautions necessary to those who may chuse to repeat the experimentmentioned in the foregoing paper ibid356 Some circumstances pointed out which may cause variations in the results p 356 Alchorne Mr Stanesby See Gold Algol Observation of the

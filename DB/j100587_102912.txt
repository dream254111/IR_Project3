TWO LETTERS FROM A GENTLEMAN IN THE COUNTRY RELATING TO MR LEUWENHOECKS LETTER IN TRANSACTION NO 283 COMMUNICATED BY MR C JUNE 21 DEAR SIR YOURS OF THE 10TH INSTANT FOUND ME AT W WHERE I ALSO MET THE TRANSACT NO 283 WHICH YOU SENT LAST FINDING SOMETHING IN IT  GREEDILY RUN IT OVER AND MUST OWN THAT I WAS A LITTLE MORTIFIED TO SEE IN IT AN ACCOUNT OF A CREATURE WHICH I THOUGHT I HAD A SORT OF PROPRIETY IN AND OF WHICH I HAD MADE A DRAUGHT WITH A DESIGN TO PRESENT YOU AND MR C WITH A RARITY WHICH I BE LIEVED NO BODY HAD MET WITH BUT MY SELF HOWEVERMR LS PICTURE OF IT BEING SO SMALL I THOUGHT MY SKETCHES WOULD NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE BECAUSE THEY NOT ONLY CONFIRM HIS ACCOUNT BUT MAY CONTRIBUTE TO GIVE YOU A MORE PERFECT IDEA OF SO ODD AN ANIMAL I FOUND IT THE BEGINNING OF THIS MONTH IN SOME CLEAR WATER WHICH I TOOK UP IN A DITCH AT W IN WHICH WITH MY UTMOST ATTENTION I COULD DISCOVER NO MORE THAN THIS ONE OF THE SAME KIND FIG I REPRESENTS IT IN ONE OF THE POSTURES IT APPEARD THE FIRST DAY FOR IT VARIES EVERY MOMENT AND THE KNOB AT A WHICH LOOKT LIKE THE GUT CAECUM WAS SOMETIMES A LITTLE MORE LENGTHEND TWO DAYS AFTER I COULD PERCEIVE TWO OR THREE WHITE FIBRES AT THE END OF IT AND ON THE FOURTH DAY THE ANIMALLYING STRETCHD AT ITS FULL LENGTH APPEARD AS IN FIG II AND I PLAINLY SAW THAT WHAT I THOUGHT AN EXCRESCENCE WAS A YOUNG  WITH 6 HORNS COMING OUT OF THE SIDE OF THE OLD ONE AND THE NEXT1495 NEXT DAY I FOUND IT IN THE WATER ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE BODY AND WAS ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THE LENGTH OF THE PARENT THE FORMATION OF THE HORNS ARE WELL FIGURD BY MR L AND THEY ISSUE LIKE RADIJ NOT FROM THE EXTREMITY BUT QUITE ROUND A SMALL KNOB WHICH I TAKE TO BE THE HEAD THE HORNS HAVE A VERMICULAR MOTION AND ARE EXTENDED OR SHORTEN D BOTH ALTOGETHER AND SEVERALLY THE OTHER END IS FLAT AT THE EXTREMITY AND HE OFTEN FIXD IT LIKE A LEECH TO THE BOTTOM OR SIDE OF THE GLASS IN WHICH I KEPT HIM HE ALSO CONTRACTS AND DILATES HIS BODY AT PLEASURE AND E SPECIALLY WHEN TOUCHD OR DISTURBD WILL BRING BOTH BODY AND HORNS INTO A SMALL COMPASS AND HAS THEN THE APPEARANCE OF FIG 3 AND 4 THE HORNS ARE PERFECTLY WHITE AND THE BODY YELLOWISH AND TO A NAKED EYE NOT EASILY DISCERNABLE IN THE WATER IT BEING WHEN EXTENDED NO THICKER THAN A GOOD HORSEHAIR THE SMALL PLANT MENTIOND IN THE SAME TRANSACT IS THE LENS PALUSTRIS OR DUCKMEAT WHICH  PLENTIFULLY ON OUR PONDS OR DITCHES BUT I MUST DISSENT FROM MR L WHERE HE SAYS IT DOES NOT COME ORIGINALLY FROM THE BOTTOM FOR I VERY WELL REMEMBER THAT MANY YEARS SINCE THE LATE W CH ESQ  ME THE MANNER OF ITS SPRINGING OUT OF THE MUD AND WE OFTEN OBSERVD THAT WHEN THE LEAVES WERE GROWN TO A COMPETENT SIZE THE FORCE OF THE WATER EASILY DREW THE MINUTE SINGLE FIBRD ROOT AND RAISD THE PLANT TO THE SURFACE I OWN THAT THE LEAVES WHEN FLOATING DO CON TINUE TO GROW AND MAY BE ENCREASD AFTER THE MANNER HE MENTIONS AND I HAVE OFTEN TAKEN THE YOUNG PLANT WHICH HE PICTURES OUT OF THEM SO THAT THEY MAY BE CALLD SEEDS MORE PROPERLY THAN LEAVES AND MY OPINION IS THAT TOWARD THE END OF THE YEAR UPON THEIR CORRUPTION THEY SINK TO THE BOTTOM AND THERE ROOT SO AS TO CONTINUE THE SUCCESSI ON THE ANIMALCULA WHICH MR L DESCRIBES STICKING TO THE  OF THE PLANT I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVD NOT ONLY IN WA TER  BUT  TO THE BODIES OF MANY SORTS OF WATER1496 WATER INSECTS WHICH I HAVE SEEN COVERD ALMOST ALL OVER WITH TUFTS OF THEM EACH TUFT BEING MADE UP OF MANY ANIMALCULA WHICH APPEAR NOT MUCH UNLIKE TO THE FLOWERS OF A LILLY OR FOXGLOVE THIS CONGERIES OF ANIMALCULA WILL ENGTHEN AND CONTRACT THEMSELVES BOTH ALTOGETHER AND SEVERALLY AND I HAVE OB SERVED THEM WHEN THEY LYE AT LENGTH TO PUT OUT SOME WONDERFULLY MINUTE ORGANS LIKE SMALL FEET NOT EASILY DIS CERND EVEN WITH MY BEST GLASSES WHICH BY THEIR QUICK AGITATION BRING A CURRENT OF WATER FROM ALL SIDES TOWARD THEM BUT I WAS NEVER SO FORTUNATE AS TO SEE THAT MOTION IN THEM WHICH HE SAYS IS LIKE THAT OF A MILL WHEEL NOR IN DEED CAN I PERCEIVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH A ROTATION OF ANY MEMBER IN AN ANIMAL MECHANISM BUT I THINK I CAN EASILY ACCOUNT FOR THIS MISTAKE OF MR L OR RATHER OF HIS PAINTER FOR IN THE SAME WATER WHEREIN I HAVE SEEN THESE PLANTS AND ANIMALCULA I HAVE OBSERVED A SMALL ROUND CREA TURE WHOSE MANY LEGS STAND LIKE RADIJ ALL ABOUT ITS BODY THIS HAS A SWIST PROGRESSIVE MOTION BUT WILL VERY OFTEN LYE STILL WHEN ONLY YOU CAN PERCEIVE THOSE RADIJ AND THEN TURN VERY SWIFTLY ROUND LIKE A WHEEL SOMETIMES ONE WAY AND THEN STOP AND TURN THE OTHER WAY WITHOUT STIRRING AN HAIRS BREADTH FORWARD NOW TIS VERY PROBABLE THAT ONE OF THESE MIGHT SHEW ITS TRICKS SO VERY NEAR TO OR AMONG A TUFT OF THE OTHER FIXD ANIMALCULA THAT IT MIGHT BE VERY WELL  FOR PART OF THE SAME AND I AM VERY CONFIDENT THIS IS MATTER OF FACT THESE ANIMALCULA ARE SOMETIMES SEEN LOOSE BUT GENERALLY THEY ARE FIXD IN CLUSTERS BY THEIR TAILS TO OTHER BODIES AND PERHAPS CANNOT SEPARATE THEMSELVES AND I THINK IT NO MEAN INSTANCE OF PROVIDENCE THAT MANY KINDS OF WATER INSECTS WHICH ARE SO FIXD AND EVEN SOME OF WHICH HAVE BUT SLOW AND IRREGULAR MOTIONS ARE FURNISHED WITH SUCH OR GANS ABOUT THEIR HEAD THE VIBRITION OF WHICH BRINGS A CON STANT CURRENT TOWARDS THEIR MOUTHS AND WITH THAT FOOD FOR THEIR SUPPORT OTHERWISE THEY WOULD BE STARVD FOR WANT OF NOURISHMENT IF1497 IF YOU ASK WHAT INSECTS THOSE ARE ON WHOSE BODIES I HAVE SEEN THESE ANIMALCULA I MUST TELL YOU THEY ARE OF DIVERS SORTS AND THAT I HAVE OBSERVD NO SMALL VARIETY IN THE WATER OF OUR DITCHES NOT ONLY OF REPTILES AND THE CATTER PILLAR KIND BUT OF EELES AND PERFECT SHELL FISH BOTH CRUS TACEOUS AND TESTACEOUS AND HAVE BEEN SO PLEASD WITH THE BEAUTY OF SOME OF THEM THAT I HAVE KEPT THEM MANY WEEKS BY ME AS AN AGREEABLE ENTERTAINMENT FOR SUCH AS ARE CURIOUS AND FARTHER DESIGND IF I COULD HAVE MET WITH A GOOD HAND IN THE COUNTRY TO HAVE GOT SOME FIGURES OF THEM WHICH I HAD ATTEMPTED MY SELF BUT WITH NO SATIS FACTION HOWEVER HAVING PRESERVD TWO TOLERABLE SCETCHES OF TWO SORTS OF THE CRUSTACEOUS KIND I VENTURE TO SEND THEM YOU SINCE THO MUCH TO THE DISADVANTAGE OF THEIR BEAUTY THEY WILL GIVE YOU A BETTER NOTION OF THEM THAN ANY THING I CAN WRITE FIG V AND VI SHEWS THEM AS THEY LYE WITH THEIR BACK TOWARDS YOU IN A SWIMMING POSTURE BUT THE MEMBERS AND LEGS ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE SO VARIOUS AND SO MUCH MORE CURIOUSLY FORMD THAN THOSE OF LOBSTERS AND SHRIMPS THAT I DESPAIRD OF GIVING ANY TOLERABLE REPRE SENTATION OF THEM IN ANY OTHER POSITION THESE ARE ABOUT THE SAME SIZE THE BIGGEST BEING RATHER LESS THAN A VERY SMALL FLEA AND THE LEAST A LITTLE BIGGER THAN A MITE BUT ALL ARE BREEDERS AND CARRY THEIR SPAWN AT THEIR TAYL THAT OF FIG 5 IN TWO BAGS ONE ON EACH SIDE WHICH ARE FASTEND ABOUT THE 5TH JOYNT AND THE OTHER IN A SINGLE BAG OR FILM UNDER THE TAYL AND I HAVE OFTEN SEEN THESE BAGS BROKEN AND THE SPAWN WHICH IS GLOBULAR AND LARGE IN THE PROPOR TION TO THE FISH SCATTERD THROUGH THE WATER THERE IS ALSO AMONG THESE A THIRD SORT OF THE SAME KIND NOT LESS ELEGANT THO FAR LESS IN BULK WHICH IS SHAPD MORE LIKE A SHRIMP AND CARRIES ITS SPAWN LIKE THAT BUT I COULD NEVER MAKE ANY FIGURE OF IT WORTH PRESERVING ONE THING I HAD LIKE TO HAVE FORGOT WHICH IS VERY REMARKABLE THAT ALL THESE THREE SPECIES AS ALSO SOME OTHER WATER INSECTS ARE CERTAINLY MONOCU LOUS AND HAVE THEIR EYE EXACTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THEIR X X X X X X X X HEAD1498 HEAD AND I COULD NEVER WITH MY UTMOST APPLICATION FIND SO MUCH AS A DIVIDING LINE IN IT SOME OF THEM ESPECIAL LY IN SOME WATERSARE DARK AND CLOUDY BUT THEY ARE GENE RALLY SO TRANSPARENTTHAT THROUGH THE SHELL I CAN SEE THE PERI STALTICK MOTION QUITE THROUGH THEIR WHOLE LENGTHAND A CON STANT PULSATION OF A PART WHICH I GUESS IS THE HEART BUT I COULD NEVER DISCOVER ANY COURSE OF BLOOD IN THEM NOR EVEN IN SHRIMPS THEMSELVES WHICH ARE AS LARGE AS SOME THOUSANDS OF THESE THO I HAVE SEEN IT PLAINLY IN CREATURES A LITTLE BIGGER VIZ THE SMALLEST NEW HATCHD SPYDERS AND IN THAT WATER INSECT WHICH IS DESCRIBD AND PICTURD THO NOT ACCURATELY BY SWAMMERDAM UNDER THE VERY IMPROPER NAME OF PULEX AQUATICUS BUT THIS IS OF THE TESTACEOUS KIND OF WHICH I HAVE SEEN A GREATER VARIETY AND NOT LESS CURIOUS THAN OF THE CRUSTACEOUS BUT TIS TOO LATE TO CALL A A NEW CAUSE JULY 5 1703 DEAR SIR SINCE MY LAST I HAVE FARTHER OBSERVD THE LENS PALUSTRIS AND AM FULLY SATISFYD OF THE TRUTH OF ITS FIRST SPRINGING FROM THE BOTTOM I LATELY TOOK UP SOME ON THE SHALLOW SIDE OF A POND AND FOUND THE ENDS OF THE STALKS MOST OF WHICH WERE AT LEAST 5 INCHES LONG AND AS THICK AS A STRONG HORSEHAIR MANIFESTLY RADICATED IN THE BOTTOM SO THAT I COULD NOT TAKE THEM UP WITHOUT RAISING THE MUD WITH THEM WHICH ALSO ADHERED VERY VISIBLY TO THEM THESE STALKS OR ROOTS ARE OF A CURIOUS TEXTURE AND ALMOST TRANSPARENT AND I HAVE SEEN THEIR OUTSIDE VERY PRETTILY COVERD WITH A REGULAR SORT OF NETWORK THE DRAUGHT IN THE TRANSACT NO 283 IS VERY STIFF AND ILL REPRESENTS THEM IN1499 IN MY OBSERVATION OF THESE STALKS I OFTEN SAW ADHERING TO THEM AND SOMETIMES SEPARATE IN THE WATER MANY PRETTY BRANCHES COMPOSD OF RECTANGULAR OBLONGS AND EXACT SQUARES WHICH WERE JOYND TOGETHERAS YOU MAY SEE IN FIG VII WHICH I DREW AS EXACTLY AS I COULD FROM ONE OF THEM THERE ARE OFTEN TWENTY OR MORE OF THESE FIGURES IN ONE BRANCH WHICH GENERALLY ADHERES AT ONE END TO THE STALKS OF THE PLANT AND I THINK IT REMARKABLE THAT THESE RECTANGULAR PARALLELOGRAMS ARE ALL OF THE SAME SIZE THE LONGEST SIDE NOT EXCEEDS 13 OF AN HAIRS BREADTH AND THAT THE LENGTH IS JUST DOUBLE THE BREADTH THE SQUARES BEING VISIBLY MADE UP OF TWO PARALLE LOGRAMS JOYND LONGWISE THEY SEEM VERY THIN AND THE TEXTURE OF EVERY ONE IS NEARLY THE SAME TO A VERY LARGE MAG NIFIER THEY APPEAR AS IN FIG VIII I TOOK THESE BRANCHES AT FIRST FOR SALTS BUT FINDING THEM ALWAYS OF THE SAME SIZE AND THAT THERE WAS NO SENSIBLE ENCREASE OF THEIR BULK WHILE THEY CONTINUED IN THE WATER THAT AFTER THEY HAD LAIN A DAY OR TWO DRY ON A GLASS PLATE THEY ALTERD NOT THEIR FIGURE AND UPON THE ADDITION OF NEW WATER WARM OR COLD THEY HAD STILL THE SAME APPEARANCE AND COHESION AND THAT THEIR AD HERENCE THO TOUCHING ONLY IN THE ANGULAR POINTS WAS SO FIRM AND RIGID THAT ALL MOVD TOGETHER AND KEPT THE SAME POSITION IN RESPECT OF ONE ANOTHER HOWEVER AGITA TED BY THE WATER THESE CONSIDERATIONS I SAY PERSWADE ME THAT THEY MAY BE RATHER PLANTS THAN SALTS BUT THEY BEING SO VERY MINUTE THAT NO JUDGMENT CAN BE MADE OF EM BUT BY THE EYE I SHALL NOT DETERMINE ANY THING POSI TIVELY IN SOME WATER WHICH I TOOK OUT OF A PIT I FOUND A SMALL WATER NEWTE NOT AN INCH LONG WHICH I SUPPOSE WAS OF THIS YEARS HATCH AND THE LEGS BEING SO SMALL AS NOT READILY TO BE DISCERND AT FIRST VIEW AND THE BODY VERY CLEAR I TOOK IT AT FIRST SIGHT FOR A FISH THIS I KEPT BY ME IN LIEU OF TAD POLES TO SHEW THE CIRCULATION OF THE BLOOD IN ITS TAYL BUT THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY ENTERTAINMENT IT GAVE ME FOR I FOUND THE COURSE OF THE BLOOD IN EVERY PART OF ITS BODY X X X X X X X X 2 AND1500 AND PARTICULARLY IN EVERY DIGIT OF THE FEET IT WAS A CURIOUS SIGHT TO OBSERVE THE STREAM COME TO THE EXTREMITY OF THE TOE IN ONE CHANNEL AND RETURN BY ANOTHER IN THIS NEWTE JUST BELOW THE SETTING ON OF THE HEAD ON EACH SIDE ARE THREE LITTLE RUGGED FLESHY B ANCHES WHICH HE SPREADS LIKE FINS AND WHICH HELP TO POISE HIS BODY OBSERVING THESE WITH THE MICROSCOPE I FOUND EACH OF THEM DIVIDED SOMETHING LIKE A LEAF OF POLIPODYINTO A GREAT MANY POINTED BRANCH INGS IN EACH OF WHICH AS IN TOES I CAN SEE THE BLOOD COME TO THE EXTREAM POINT ON ONE SIDE AND RETURN ON THE OTHER AND THIS IS THE MORE ENTERTAINING BECAUSE 30 OR 40 OF THESE BRANCHINGS WILL SOMETIMES APPEAR AT ONE VIEW AND THE BLOOD SEEN DISTINCTLY CIRCULATING IN ALL FOR AS MR COWPER RIGHTLY OBSERVES THE GLOBULES OF THE BLOOD OF THESE CREATURES ARE VERY LARGE SO THAT I CAN SEE THE CIRCULATION IN THEM VERY WELL EVEN WITH THE SMALLEST MAGNIFIERS WHICH TAKE IN A GREAT AREA AND FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID OF THIS COURSE OF BLOOD I AM PERSWADED THAT THESE ORGANS IN THE NEWTE ARE NOT ONLY DESIGND TO BE SERVICEABLE IN THEIR SWIMMING BUT THO THEY HAVE LUNGS LIKE A FROG MAY BE ALSO ANALOGOUS TO THE GILLS IN FISHES IN MY EXAMINATION OF THE WATERS OF OUR DITCHES IN WHICH I DAILY FIND NEW VARIETIES OF ANIMALCULA I HAD THE GOOD LUCK TO MEET WITH GREAT NUMBERS OF THOSE ROUND BO DIES MENTIOND BY MR LEEUWENHOECK IN THE TRANSACTIONS NO 261 ANNO 1700 WHICH ARE THERE SO WELL DESCRIBED THAT I SHOULD NOT HAVE AGAIN SPOKE OF THEM ONLY THAT I SAW A VERY SURPRIZING PHAENOMENON WHILE I WAS OBSERVING THEM EACH OF THESE SPHERICAL BODIES WHICH ARE SMALLER THAN A MUSTARD SEED HAVE A CONSTANT PROGRESSIVE MOTION AND AT THE SAME TIME A SLOW REVOLUTION ABOUT THEIR OWN AXE AND CONTAIN WITHIN THEM OTHER SMALL GLOBULES SOME MORE SOME LESS BUT I NEVER FOUND ABOVE 10 IN ANY ONE AND THESE I HAVE SEEN MOVE AND CHANGE THEIR POSITION WITHIN THE OTHER WHICH MR L SAYS HE NEVER OBSERVED WHILE I HAD ONE OF THESE BODIES ON A GLASS PLATE BEFORE MY MICROSCOPE I SAW AS1501 AS HE DESCRIBES IT ONE OF THE CONTAIND GLOBULES SLIP OUT OF IT AND WHILE THE GREAT ONE LAY STILL FOR WANT OF SUFFI CIENT DEPTH OF WATER TO FLOAT IN THIS LITTLE ONE THAT CAME OUT HAD IMMEDIATELY A VERY QUICK ROTATION ON ITS AXE AND WHAT WAS MOST SURPRIZING AT THE SAME TIME IT KEPT AN E QUABLE REVOLUTION ABOUT THE BIGGER GLOBE AS THE CENTER OF ITS ORBIT ALWAYS VERY NEARLY AT THE SAME DISTANCE THO I COULD NOT PERCEIVE ANY VORTEX IN THE WATER WHICH BORE IT AND WHAT IS YET MORE REMARKABLE I SAW IT STOP AND THEN MAKE ITS REVOLUTION ROUND THE CENTRAL BODY THE CONTRARY WAY THE ROTATION ON ITS OWN AXE ALWAYS CONTINUING AND WHEN THE WATER WAS SO FAR EVAPORATED THAT ALL LAY AT REST BY THE ADDITION OF NEW WATER THE SAME MOTIONS WERE RE NEWD THIS I THOUGHT A VERY PRETTY REPRESENTATION OF THE PLANETARY MOTIONS ABOUT THE SUN AND I DOUBT NOT BUT A CARTESIAN PHILOSOPHER WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A LITTLE PLEASD TO SEE IN NATURE SUCH AN INSTANCE OF SUCH REVOLUTIONS OF AN INANIMATE BODY IN SUCH A MEDIUM AS WATER INDEED I THINK IT NOT EASY TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE MOTIONS OF THESE GLOBULES NOR WILL I TO SOLVE THE DIFFICULTY SAY IN CONTRADI CTION TO MR LEEUWH THAT I BELIEVE THEM ANIMATE THO I HAVE FORMERLY SEEN SOME NOT VERY UNLIKE THEM BOTH IN SHAPE AND MOTION WHICH I AM SATISFYD ARE ANIMALS BUT OF THOSE AMONG OTHER THINGS I LAST YEAR GAVE AN ACCOUNT TO SIR CH HOLT WHICH I HEAR WILL SHORTLY BE PUBLISHD IN THE TRANSACTIONS I CAN AT PRESENT THINK OF NO OTHER OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND TO FILL UP MY PAPER UNLESS YOU SHOULD THINK IT WORTH YOUR NOTICE THAT I FIND ALL THE EARWIGS WHICH I HAVE EXA MIND BY A MICROSCOPE INFESTED WITH GREAT NUMBERS OF MINUTE INSECTS WHICH STICK LIKE LICE ON MANY PARTS OF THEIR BODIES AND ESPECIALLY JUST UNDER THE SETTING ON OF THEIR HEAD THEY ARE ALIKE ON ALL AND I NEVER FOUND THE SAME ON ANY OTHER ANIMAL THEY ARE WHITE AND SHINING LIKE MIRES BUT MUCH SMALLER ARE ROUND BACKD FLAT BELLIED AND HAVE LONG LEGS ESPECIALLY THE TWO FOREMOST II PART

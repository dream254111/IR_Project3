earnings of the pupils who could articulate and read speech from the mouth from those who could not I have no doubt that pupils who speak have an advantage in life over those who do not and that statistics will demonstrate that their average earnings exceed the average earnings of those who are unable to articulate If this should turn out to be the case what an argument it would be to present to legislatures in favor of appropriations for articulation teaching  I venture to predict we shall find that our former pupils who speak even though they may be unable to read speech earn more per annum than those who are forced to resort exclusively to manual means of communication and those of them who can read speech as well as speak are still bet ter off in life Mr Davidson of the Pennsylvania Institution has sug gested another valuable line of inquiry From a comparison of numerous letters in his possession he makes the assertion that orallytaught pupils improve in their knowledge and use of language after leaving school I would suggest the importance of preserving uncorrected letters of your pupils during the whole period of their school life and of keeping up correspondence with them after they leave school A comparison of letters written by the same pupil at different periods of time would be invaluable as a means of determin ing his progress and the correspondence in adult life might be utilized for the purpose of collecting statistics concerning the earnings and general success in life of our pupils REMARKS ON NORTH AMERICAN LICHENOLOGY PRELIMINARY BY W W CALKINS IN introducing the above title for my subject I owe to myself and to the promoters and patrons of a journal em bracing the scope influence and popularity of Science an explanation of my purpose in bringing into public notice that department of botany which it appears to me as an humble worker in this field has heretofore received too little attention from botanists and institutions of learning in North America My object is then to contribute in some measure towards the upbuilding of a more general interest among students in what seems to have been considered an uninteresting and obscure field of research In other departments there are workers by the hundreds In American lichenology only one name and one life stands out preeminent as the founder promoter and able exponent of the science Edward Tuckerman He has gone to his rest but his works remain As a systematist he brought order out of chaos He formulated and developed a classifi cation more nearly approaching Nature in her arrangements and divisions of the Lichens than any previous authors unless it be Elias Fries and Dr Nylanderboth illustrious names This system thus established by Tuckerman is the basis of the science in this country and his published writings the sole textbook and guide of the American student Tucker mans style of writing is certainly uniquesui generis but when once comprehended impressive and convincing as well as clear I confess to long vigils before I could un derstand him Having had the benefit of collecting and comparing the greater part of the species described by him in thleir native habitats my admiration for his profound kntowledge apprehension and farseeing into the secrets of VOL XX No 499 nature as evinced by what he calls habit increases with each review of his works This was made plainer to me from recent investigations in Tennessee Alabama and Georgia by the fortunate finding of several rare saxicolous species which Tuckerman described and which had not been seen since Judge T M Peters dis covered and sent theni to him There were doubts in my mind which were now dissipated by an actual review in situ day after day as I wandered over the calcareous rocks of the mountain region where found I will now only specify one species Pannaria stenophylla which grows intermixed and cunningly hidden with another but more common form Pannaria Petersii The thallus and reddishbrown fruit are scarcely distinguishable at first I a m indebted to the keen discrimination of my friend S Higginson for the complete settlement of this rare species Since Tuckermans death no one has appeared to fill his place the nearest approach being Henry Willey who how ever has retired from active work but not without leaving two publications of great value In a recent letter to me from Dr Nylander he laments these losses to American science But what has been can be We must wait for someone of preeminent ability and adaptation to grow into the vacancy Meantime I doubt if anyone in the United States is making a special study of Lichens Two or three have considerable knowledge of them however This is to be regretted An inviting field vast and rich is open and offers great rewards Who would exchange a fame like Tuckermans for any amount of worldly wealth  I appre hend that he himself did not realize the extent or value of his own labors to which his entire life was devoted neither the gratitude of his followers and successors who without the works he left would be without a guide and like an army without a general I am sure that my colaborers will agree with me in this We may then be considered as entering upon a new era in the prospects and progress of the study in this country which is coincident with the tremendous strides shown in phaenogamic botany and in the increasing number of students in cryptogamia as the fungi Having myself for many years worked in those fields and witnessed the growth and increasing number of students I have watched for corresponding interest as to Lichens From the evidence received by me the future is promising While specialists in Europe have explored every corner and the great Nylander has given a lifetime of labor to this subject the species of only detached portions of America have been investigated The extreme south of our coasts and the far west are almost a terra incognita The sub tropical portions are prolific in new species and rare forms It was my fortune to find and submit a large number of these to Willey and Nylander yet I merely skimmed over the surface The southern Appalachian Mountain region is almost as interesting in its rock forms which are the most difficult perhaps to study vide Nylander on my new Ten nessee species Their interest is however exceedingly great While it is true that hundreds of new forms remain to be discovered and are a great incentive to the explorer yet it is clear that the resolution of those now known will afford active and valuable work to whoever undertakes it It being admitted that the study of Lichens is difficult still with such aids as I have mentioned and ready access to the increasing herbariums and literature of the subject the ob stacles and objections disappear rapidlyit being supposed that one pursues the subject con amore 147 California Ave Chicago Ill

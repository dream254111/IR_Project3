that those who work for the highest ends will best attain them in humble obedience to the common laws Transcendentally this may be denied the warning finger may be despised as the hand of the coward and the profane but the fact remainsthe fact of an awful chain of English graves stretch ing across Africa Hairs as Records of Emotional Disturbances Dr Pineus of Berlin claims to be able by the aid of the polari scope to detect certain traces of past emotions in the hairs He explains that under the influence of mental disturbances of a violent kind the hairs become decolorized at the junction of the lower two thirds with the upper third reckoning from the surface of the skin to the root of the hairs The observation if exact is interesting but the recollection of such emotions is generally too vivid to render any artificial aid to memory necessary If Dr Pineus could only devise a means of detecting emotions to come says the Medical Press his procede would excite a vast deal more curiosity NOTES AND NEWS IN the course of an article on recent progress in Egypt the London Times says t Both Egyptians and English are now alive to the need of educational progress The people are no longer apathetic as they were in the days of Mehemet Ali who collected his pupils by force as he did his conscripts and only kept them together by giving them food lodging clothing and a monthly money payment of considerable value Parents no longer believe the Koran contains every thing or rather that what it does not contain is worth nothing They are not yet alive to the advan tages of trade or handicrafts but they are fully alive to the ad vantages of government employment and even in the villages a better class of education is urgently demanded But want of funds stops the way A general system of sound elementary education throughout the country would be one of the greatest blessings the English could confer but it would cost money and it cannot be done All attention is concentrated on the higher schools in the big towns and in Cairo You might as well try to build a pyramid without a base Then again there are no teachers to teach the pupils Inspection of such teaching as there is and the establishment of normal schools for the training of the teachers of the future are sadly wanted Although the ob vious duty of the English is to produce a class of Egyptian teach ers still the higher schools must remain for some time in the hands of professors from Europe The educational system does not look so bad on paper There are over 7000 schools in the country and 7764 teachers but the teaching is miserable and out of a population of nearly 7000000 of people only 200000 can read and write  In Austria there is not only a high school of agriculture costing the state 125000 florins a year but there are fifteen inter mediate and eightythree primary agricultural schools besides nine chairs of agriculture in polytechnic establishments and agricultural experiment stations Moreover as stated in the London Educa tional Times there are 162 courses of agricultural lectures at tended on an average by about 10000 personsa year The whole expense of agricultural subventions is set down in the Austrian Estimates for the present year as 1777034 florins At a meeting of the International Meteorological Congress held in Paris last September the Rev Father Denza read a paper on  The Decrease of Temperature in the Vertical Line Accord ing to the figures he produced the annual mean ascent required to obtain a decrease of one degree of temperature was 150 metres in the valley of Aosta and 191 at Moncalieri Monte Cenis while 192 was the mean for the whole of Italy At Pikes Peak Colorado 159 metres is the height required In the winter months the heights in the valley of Aosta and at Moncalieri are 189 and 375 respectively and 289 is the mean for Italy It frequently hap pens that the temperature rises until a certain height is reached and then decreases This was particularly noticeable in January  887 when the temperature increased up to 700 metres at out 2200 NCE VOL XVI No 402 feet and then diminished according to the ordinary law The barometric pressure was high the air dry and calm This phe nomenon was confirmed by observations referred to by other members of the congress and Pere Dechevrens pointed out the necessity of taking the barometric pressure into account in com paring changes of temperature in the vertical In China at an observatory situated on a mountain in the midst of a vast plain a rise of ten degrees of temperature is always observed for a fall of 20 millimetres in barometric pressure and at Mount Washington when the wind blows at the rate of 100 miles an hour the varia tion of the temperature is thirty degrees for the same decrease of pressure  In the Teachers School of Science of the Boston Society of Natural History Dr J Walter Fewkes will give a series of ten lessons Lowell free courses during the winter of 189091  On Common Marine Animals from Massachusetts Bay The general scope of this course will embrace the ordinary marine animals of New England It is intended to give special attention to the mode of life differences in external forms local distribution habitats methods and proper time to collect the eggs young and adults The anatomy embryology and morphology of the spe cies considered will be dealt with incidentally wherever these branches of research can be used advantageously The introduc tory lecture will give an outline of the course The relative abundance of species and individuals local causes which influence distribution the rocky or sandy nature of the shores and their characteristic faunae and the influence of depth of water tides and temperature will be considered The relations and bounda ries of the marine fauna of New England will be treated of under the following headings comparison of the fauna of Massachusetts Bay with that of Narragansett Bay and the Bay of Fundy and causes of the differences observed pelagic animals littoral andc shallow water genera introduced and indigenous marine animals  marine animals which inhabit both brackish and fresh water In the remaining lessons the principles discussed in the first lesson will be applied to the life histories of various characteristic species among the lower forms of marine animals The course will be illustrated as far as possible For further information address the secretary of the Boston Society of Natural History Writing to Nature on the subject of sonorous sand Mr Henry C Hyndman asks whether Professor H C Bolton is aware of ani inland locality in South Africa where it is stated the sands are sonorous In a recent letter to the eotsman Mr Hyndman men tioned that he had come across a paragraph in a work entitled Twentyfive Years in an African Wagon by Andrew A Ander ton published in 1887 in which the author said Before leaving this part of the Griqualand West I should like to describe that peculiar sand formation on the west side of the Langberg Mountain which is in fact part of it I heard from many of the Griquas and Potgielet living near it that the lofty hills are constantly changing that is the sandhills 500 and 600 feet in height in the course of a few years subside and other sandhills are formed where before it was level ground And then in a footnote it is added  I regret very much that the description of this sand for mation has been left out it being the only extraordinary geological formation known in Africa and fully describes the musical sand  A means of easy intercommunication between writers editors and publishers has long been needed To supply this need the editor of The Writer the Boston magazine for literary workers has undertaken to compile a Directory of American Writers Editors and Publishers which will be published at the earliest possible day No charge whatever will be made for the insertion of names and addresses in this directory the usefulness of which particularly to editors and publishers wWho wish tocommunicate with writers will be evident at a glance The desire of the editor is to make the directory as nearly complete as possible but the army of minor writers is so great that it will be necessary to limit the number of addresses in some reasonable way It has been thought best therefore to include in the first edition only the names of writers who have had a contribution printed in some one of the leading magazines or weekly periodicals during the last five years cr who have had a book published within theSCIENCE last ten years Writers who are included in either of these classes are requested to send at once to the editor of The Writer P 0 Box 1905 Boston Mass the following items of information 1 name of writer 2 present residence 3 permanent business ad dress 4 literary specialty 5 titles of principal articles or books printed and dates of publication This information should be sent promptly for the directory has been for some time in prepa ration and its publication will not be long delayed The editor of the directory will be obliged if in addition writers will send on a separate sheet not for publication in the directory autobio graphical particulars including date of birth place of birth parentsnames date of marriage name of husband or wife suc cessive places of residence title and date of first work printed list of later works and other such matters as would be suitable for publication in a Biographical Dictionary of American Authors now in course of preparation By the prompt coopera tion of those who are interested in the matter the early publica tion of the directory may be secured  Mr John E Nowers of BurtononTrent writes as follows on the tenacity of life in a cat in Hardwickes cience Gossip for October A very severe accident to a cat came under my notice about two years ago The cat was in the habit of catching mice under a machine for lowering casks into a brewery cellar One evening it was working and the first hogshead of ale was rolled on and lowered When it reached the bottom the screams of an animal attracted the attention of the man He looked and found the cat was trapped between the edge of the cage and the floor She was caught across the loins and had to remain in that posi tion until he called another man to help him upend the hogshead If he had rolled it off it would have smashed the cat to atoms as its weight was about six hundredweight When the cat was released she crawled away and they could not find her again that night Next morning she was found in the cellar alive and brought up to me I examined her and could not find any bones broken but she could hardly move I decided not to kill her but try and bring her round so made a bed in a warm corner of the engineroom She lay there for three or four days in a very weak and bad state In about a week she had three dead kittens and then began to recover rapidly For a few weeks she could only limp a short distance from her bed She is still alive and no one would notice by her appearance that she had ever been so badly hurt Since that time she has had about eight kittens She is very quick in all her movements and a very keen mouser When I read the note on the same subject in Science Gossip for July I thought the above might interest some of your readers The monthly report of Arthur Winslow State geologist of Missouri shows that during the month of September de tailed mapping has progressed uninterruptedly in the coal fields in Randolph Chariton Howard and Johnson Coun ties and in the southeast in St Frangois and Iron Counties About a hundied and fifty square miles have been covered The examination of the clays and structural materials of Kan sas City and of the tributary country was begun about the middle of the month and work has been done in both Jackson and Henry Counties There are in and about Kansas City some thirtytwo works engaged in the manufacture of clay products and from fifteen to twenty quarries The country about this city including Henry and other counties has valuable deposits of clays and other structural materials which are supplied to Kansas City and other points hence from Kansas City as a centre will prop erly be made an examination of a large portion of western central Missouri In connection with this line of work inspections have further been made of clay deposits and works in Callaway and Audrain Counties The examination of the mineral waters of the State has been actively pushed in the field during the past month About thirty localities have been visited and some twenty sam ples for analysis have been collected from the following sixteen counties Monroe Audrain Callaway Boone Howard Ranoolph Livingston Worth Gentry Nodaway Buchanan Platte Clinton Clay Adair and Jackson As this work progresses the impor tance of the subject is constantly developing A very large amount of capital has been invested in improvements at numerous 217 of these springs in the State and many of them have a large pat ronage There is evidence that the waters at many places are of decided therapeutic value though a determination of their com positions is necessary to fully substantiate this Paleontologic work has been in progress in Henry St Clair Polk and Greene Counties and large additions have been made to the collections of the survey besides what has been gathered for study through the cooperation of the United States Geological Survey During the latter half of the month work has been done in classifying label ling and arranging specimens for exhibition in the cabinet of the survey Besides this systematic work inspections for special purposes have been made in Camden Laclede St Clair Ran dolph and Callaway Counties The work in the coalfields has already progressed far enough for it to be apparent that the coal lands at present under development represent only a small portion of the whole and that many farms and other lands contain beds which should prove valuable possessions to their owners These lands offer a promising field for investment and that this fact is appreciated by those who have knowledge of the ground is evi denced by the extent to which such lands in some sections are passing into the control of investors and companies The Manchester England Steam Users Association has issued a report on a series of experiments made with a view of ascer taining the result of injecting feedwater into a boiler when the boiler is short of water and the furnace is redhot It has for long been a common belief among engineers that many boiler explosions are due to this cause and to the same cause have been attributed accidents to domestic circulating boilers which have been allowed to run dry and have then had cold feedwater admitted The correctness of this belief has however for some time been doubted and the elaborate series of experiments recorded in this re port go to prove that it is altogether erroneous As described in the Journal of the Society of Arts London a Lancashire boiler 27 feet long was fitted up for the purpose of the experiments so that the condition which it was desired to investigate could be repro duced while observations could be taken of what was going on within the boiler These experiments were by no means free from danger and an observatory had to be constructed near the boiler As a result it was found that the sudden injection of the cold feed did not cause a rapid generation of steam and a sudden violent pressure which the boiler in its weakened condition cohld not stand In some cases indeed the pressure was slightly raised but it always fell immediately afterwards and in some cases the cold feed at once lowered the pressure The writers of the report even think that it might be advantageous in cases where the water has been allowed to get very low and the furnacecrowns to be come heated to turn on the feed though they hesitate in the present state of knowledge on the subject to recommend such a proceeding The London Times prints statistics compiled by the Lyons syndicate of silk merchants respecting the production of silk in the world last year The figures are of course merely approxi mate for the results of the harvest in the interior of China Japan India Persia and the Caucasus cannot be absolutely estimated If it were possible to get the exact figures of the production in these comparatively unknown regions it is not an exaggeration to say that the general silkproduction of the world would be found to be double what the figures show it to be now The syndicate has no interest in securing definite information con cerning these remote districts It is sufficient for commercial purposes to obtains the returns of the European harvests and those districts of the Far East which supply European and American manufacturers The syndicate estimates the general production of silk in 1889 at 11706000 kilos For the previous four years the figures were as follows 1888 11548000 kilos 1887 11888000 kilos 1886 10554000 kilos and 1885 9002000kilos The aver age of the four years 1885 to 1888 being 10748000 kilos it will be seen that the production of 1889 considerably exceeds the average This result has been obtained notwithstanding the deficiency in the European harvests owing to the improvement in the Levant district notably Syria and especially in the larger Asiatic ar rivals OCTOBER 17 1890

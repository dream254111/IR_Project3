J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1012199,RECENT TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES,I242638,RECENT TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING PURPOSES BY EDWIN GRUHL ASSISTANT TO PRESIDENT THE NORTH AMERICAN COMPANY THE INVESTOR IN PUBLIC UTILITY SECURITIES HAS FREQUENTLY EXPRESSED REGRET THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO DEFINITE AUTHORITATIVE STATEMENT OF THE PRINCIPLES OF THE RATEMAKING VALUE THE FACILITIES FOR THE REGULA TION OF RATES HAVE WITHIN THE PAST FEW YEARS BEEN MATERIALLY INCREASED COMMISSIONS WITH BROAD POWERS OF REGULATION ARE NOW PROVIDED IN MOST STATES THE PROCEDURE WITH WHICH INVESTIGATIONS MAY BE STARTED IS RELATIVELY SIMPLE A RATE CASE IS NO LONGER THE INDICATION OF WIDE SPREAD DISSATISFACTION IN THE COMMUNITY BUT MORE OFTEN THE RESULT OF INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINT NOR HAVE THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES IN ANY WAY BEEN LESSENED THE INQUIRY IN RATE CASES IS USUALLY DIRECTED TOWARD THE INCOME AND THUS THE INVESTMENT VALUE OF THE ENTIRE PUBLIC UTILITY UNDER PREVAILING PRACTICES THE TESTIMONY DOES NOT CONCERN ITSELF PRINCIPALLY WITH THE REASONABLENESS OF THE RATE BUT WITH THE SIZE OF THE RESULTING RETURN UPON THE INVESTMENT THIS SITUATION HAS DEVELOPED THE NEED FOR SOME UNQUALIFIED DECLARATION OF PRINCIPLES BY WHICH THE PROSPECTIVE INVESTOR MAY ASSURE HIMSELF IN A PRELIMINARY MANNER OF THE CLEAR TITLE OF THE INVESTMENT TO WHICH HE IS ABOUT TO CONTRIBUTE WITH A NUMBER OF UTILITIES INQUIRIES AS TO THE REASONABLE NESS OF PREVAILING RATES HAVE ALREADY RUN THEIR COURSE AND THE RELATION OF THE INVESTMENT TO THE CUSTOMER HAS BEEN MORE OR LESS DEFINITELY DE TERMINED IN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CASES HOWEVER THESE ASSURANCES ARE STILL LACKING THE EXAMINATION OF DECISIONS AS TO THE ELEMENTS OF VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES ARE THEREFORE NO LONGER OF THEO RETICAL OR ACADEMIC INTEREST BUT HAVE ASSUMED LARGE PRACTICAL IM PORTANCE THE INDEFINITENESS IN DECISIONS AS TO THE PRINCIPLES OF RATEMAK ING VALUE ARE PROBABLY DUE TO TWO REASONS THE EQUITIES OF INVESTOR AND CUSTOMER ARE A COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP WHICH CANNOT READILY BE ENCOMPASSED AND DEFINED AS A SINGLE ARITHMETICAL PROCESS TO BE APPLIED TO ANY SET OF FACTS THE COURT OF LAST RESORT MOREOVER IN REVIEWING THE DETERMINATION OF VALUE BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES AND COMMISSIONS HAS 219THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY NOT BEEN CONCERNED SO MUCH WITH THE EXAMINATION OF ECONOMIC DOC TRINES OR THE WISDOM OF LEGISLATIVE POLICIES OF REGULATION AS WITH THE APPLICATION OF A PARTICULAR RATE TO THE PROPERTY RIGHTS INVOLVED IT IS THEREFORE NOT SURPRISING THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE LEADING CASE SMYTH VS AMES 169 US 466 DECIDED IN 1898 WE HOLD HOWEVER THAT THE BASIS OF ALL CALCULATIONS AS TO THE REASONABLE NESS OF RATES TO BE CHARGED BY A CORPORATION MAINTAINING A HIGHWAY UNDER LEGIS LATIVE SANCTION MUST BE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY BEING USED BY IT FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE PUBLIC AND IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THAT VALUE THE ORIGINAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION THE AMOUNT EXPENDED IN PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS THE AMOUNT AND MARKET VALUE OF ITS BONDS AND STOCK THE PRESENT AS COMPARED WITH THE ORIGINAL COST OF CONSTRUCTION THE PROBABLE EARNING CAPACITY OF THE PROPERTY UNDER PARTICULAR RATES PRESCRIBED BY STATUTE AND THE SUM REQUIRED TO MEET OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALL MATTERS FOR CONSIDERATION AND ARE TO BE GIVEN SUCH WEIGHT AS MAY BE JUST AND RIGHT IN EACH CASE WE DO NOT SAY THAT THERE MAY NOT BE OTHER MATTERS TO BE REGARDED IN ESTIMATING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY SHOULD BE REITERATED RATHER THAN MORE DEFINITELY STATED IN THE MINNE SOTA RATE CASES 230 US 352 434 DECIDED JUNE 9 1913 THE ASCERTAINMENT OF THAT VALUE IS NOT CONTROLLED BY ARTIFICIAL RULES IT IS NOT A MATTER OF FORMULAS BUT THERE MUST BE A REASONABLE JUDGMENT HAVING ITS BASIS IN A PROPER CONSIDERATION OF ALL RELEVANT FACTS IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO SUPPOSE HOWEVER THAT THE STATE COM MISSIONS DEALING WITH THE DETAILED EVIDENCE AS TO VALUES WOULD PRO CEED IN AN IDENTICAL MANNER AND ADOPT COMMON PRACTICES AND THEORIES BUT THIS IS FAR FROM BEING THE CASE ALTHOUGH THERE ARE CERTAIN TEN DENCIES WHICH POINT TOWARD UNIFORMITY THE EARLIER RATE DECISIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SUMMARIZED IN VARIOUS TEXTS AND IT WOULD BE REPE TITION TO REFER TO THEM IN DETAIL IN A SHORT DISCUSSION ATTENTION IS THEREFORE DIRECTED IN THIS ARTICLE TO THE MORE RECENT CASES COVERING THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR 1912 AND THE YEAR 1913 WHICH PARTICULARLY REVEAL DEPARTURES FROM PREVIOUS RULINGS COMPARISONS OF THIS KIND ARE SELDOM CONCLUSIVE IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT A STUDY OF THE ACTUAL FACTS AND CONDITIONS SURROUNDING EACH PARTICULAR CASE WITH WHICH THE COMMISSION WAS UNDOUBTEDLY FAMILIAR BUT TO WHICH THERE ARE ONLY MEAGER CLEWS IN THE READING OF THE DECISION WOULD PROBABLY DISCLOSE THAT WHAT RATE REGULATION IS ENDEAVORING TO ACCOMPLISH IS FULL AND ABSTRACT JUSTICE AND THAT MUCH OF THE THEORETICAL BACKGROUND FOR THESE DECISIONS HAS BEEN FILLED IN AND ELABORATED IN EXTENDED DICTA 220TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING AFTER AND NOT BEFORE THE ACTUAL DECISION HAS BEEN REACHED IN NO OTHER WAY IS ONE ABLE TO EXPLAIN THE GREAT DIVERSITY OF VIEWPOINT WITH WHICH ONE IS CONFRONTED IN ANY COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS OF THE SOCALLED PRINCIPLES OF VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IT IS REASONABLE TO ASSUME ALSO THAT IF ANY SINGLE ECONOMIC LAW UNDERLIES THE PROPER RATEMAKING VALUE IT WILL NOT BE ESTABLISHED UNTIL EVERY AVAILABLE VIEWPOINT AND APPLICATION HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTED ECO NOMIC PRINCIPLES OF MONEY OF INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND OF TAXATION HAVE TAKEN A LONG TIME TO MATTRE AND HAVE BEEN PRECEDED BY INNU MERABLE THEORIES AND PROPAGANDAS BEFORE THEY HAVE FINALLY REACHED THE STAGE WHERE GENERALIZATION HAS BEEN PROPER SUCH SWEEPING AND CON FLICTING CONCLUSIONS AS THOSE OF PROFESSOR JOHNH GRAY FORMER DIRECTOR OF INVESTIGATION OF THE NATIONAL CIVIC FEDERATION BEFORE THE AMERI CAN ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION THAT ON ANY SOUND PRINCIPLE THERE SHOULD BE NO VALUATION FOR RATE REGULATION BUT HISTORY THAT IS A STATEMENT OF OUTLAY OF MONEY SPENT AND SERVICES REN DERED NOTHING MORE  AS AN AGENT THE UTILITY EXERCISES THE RIGHT OF EMINENT DOMAIN MUST GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF ITS STEWARDSHIP IS SUBJECT TO CONTIN UOUS CONTROL IS LIABLE FOR COMPULSORY SERVICE AND MUST COOPERATE WITH ALL OTHER PUBLIC AGENTS OF ITS PRINCIPAL THE STATE OR THOSE OF A COMMITTEE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS UPON THE SUBJECT OF VALUATION FOR PURPOSES OF RATE MAKING THAT   THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES A VALUATION OF AN OLD PROPERTY BASED ON ITS ACTUAL COST TO BE GENERALLY IMPRACTICABLE MAKING IT NECESSARY TO ADOPT THE COST OF REPRODUCTION METHOD   IN THE OPINION OF THE COMMITTEE IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY JUST AND EQUITABLE    TO PROVIDE BY LAW THAT FUTURE PUBLIC SERVICE PROPERTIES SHOULD BE VALUED ON THE BASIS OF THEIR ACTUAL REASONABLE EXISTING INVESTMENT AND TO DETERMINE OR LIMIT RATES UPON SUCH A VALUATION IF THE SERVICE RENDERED PERMITS SEEM BOTH IN THE LIGHT OF PRESENT DECISIONS AND PRACTICES PREMATURE IN THE RECENT RATE CASES THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW HAS CON TINUED TO BE THE FACTOR OF VALUE GIVEN THE GREATER ATTENTION IT IS ACCEPTED AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE MINNESOTA CASES 230 US 352452 THE COSTOFREPRODUCTION METHOD IS OF SERVICE IN ASCERTAINING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE PLANT WHEN IT IS REASONABLY APPLIED AND WHEN THE COST OF REPRODUC ING THE PROPERTY MAY BE ASCERTAINED WITH A PROPER DEGREE OF CERTAINTY BUT IT DOES NOT JUSTIFY THE ACCEPTANCE OF RESULTS WHICH DEPEND UPON MERE CONJECTURE 221THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY BUT ESTIMATES OF THE INCREASED VALUE OF RIGHTOFWAY REAL ESTATE ARE LIMITED TO THE NORMAL MARKET VALUE OF LAND IN THE VICINITY AND THE COURT CAUTIONS AGAINST THE USE OF HYPOTHETICAL ADDITIONS OVER AND ABOVE SUCH NORMAL VALUES ASSUMING THAT THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO A REASONABLE SHARE IN THE GENERAL PROSPERITY OF THE COMMUNITIES WHICH IT SERVES AND THUS TO ATTRIBUTE TO ITS PROP ERTY AN INCREASE IN VALUE STILL THE INCREASE SO ALLOWED APART FROM ANY IMPROVE MENTS IT MAY MAKE CANNOT PROPERLY EXTEND BEYOND THE FAIR AVERAGE OF THE NORMAL MARKET VALUE OF LAND IN THE VICINITY HAVING A SIMILAR CHARACTER OTHER WISE WE ENTER THE REALM OF MERE CONJECTURE WE THEREFORE HOLD THAT IT WAS ERROR TO BASE THE ESTIMATES OF VALUE OF THE RIGHTOFWAY YARDS AND TERMINALS UPON THE SOCALLED RAILWAY VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THE COMPANY WOULD CER TAINLY HAVE NO GROUND OF COMPLAINT IF IT WERE ALLOWED A VALUE FOR THESE LANDS EQUAL TO THE FAIR AVERAGE MARKET VALUE OF SIMILAR LAND IN THE VICINITY WITHOUT ADDITIONS BY THE USE OF MULTIPLIERS OR OTHERWISE TO COVER HYPOTHETICAL OUTLAYS A BETTER RECOGNITION OF THE LIMITATIONS OF APPRAISAL BY ENGINEERS AND THE NECESSITY OF PROVIDING AGAINST OMISSIONS IN ESTIMATING COSTS OTHER THAN THOSE OF MERE LABOR AND MATERIAL HAVE LED TO AN INCREASE IN THE PERCENTAGE ALLOWANCE FOR SOCALLED OVERHEAD ITEMS OF THE CON STRUCTION INCLUDING SUPERINTENDENCE LEGAL EXPENSES INTEREST DURING CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND CONTINGENCIES IT IS NOTED THAT THE WISCONSIN COMMISSION WHICH IN ITS EARLIER CASES ALLOWED 12 PER CENT FOR SUCH ITEMS HAS FINALLY MADE AN INCREASE OF ITS ALLOWANCE TO 15 PER CENT IN ITS DECISION CITY OF MILWAUKEE VS MILWAUKEE GAS LIGHT COMPANY DECIDED AUGUST 14 1913 12 WRCR 441 444 THE COM MISSION HELD THE PROPER ALLOWANCE FOR THIS ITEM CANNOT BE STATED IN GENERAL SINCE IT DEPENDS UPON MANY VARIABLE CONDITIONS PARTICULARLY UPON THE MAKEUP OF THE UNIT PRICES TO THE SUM OF WHICH IT IS TO BE APPLIED ALL OF THIS OVERHEAD MIGHT BE ADDED TO THE INDIVIDUAL ITEMS BUT SINCE A GREAT DEAL OF IT IS NOT EASILY AS SIGNED TO ANY PARTICULAR ITEM IT IS CUSTOMARY TO ADD IT TO THE TOTAL PRACTICE HOWEVER IS NOT AT ALL UNIFORM AS TO WHAT SHOULD PROPERLY BE INCLUDED IN UNIT PRICES AND WHAT SHOULD BE CARRIED AS OVERHEAD A KNOWLEDGE OF THE MAKEUP OF UNIT PRICES IS THEREFORE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE PROPER ALLOWANCE FOR OVERHEAD THE COMMISSION HAS POINTED OUT IN THE CASE CITY OF MILWAUKEE VS THE MILWAUKEE ELECTRIC RAILWAY AND LIGHT COMPANY 10WRCR 1 107 108 THAT ITS UNIT PRICES RATHER THAN THE PERCENTAGE ALLOWANCE INCLUDE SOME OF THE SOCALLED OVERHEAD ITEMS 222TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING AS REGARDS THE UNIT COSTS USED IN APPRAISING THE INVENTORY IT IS TO BE NOTED THAT THESE ARE IN MOST INSTANCES FIVE YEAR AVERAGE PRICES DESIGNED TO INCLUDE CONTRACTORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS COMMISSIONS THE ENHANCED COST OF PIECEMEAL AS COMPARED WITH CONTINUOUS CONSTRUCTION AND THE COST OF HANDLING MATERIAL AND LABOR UNTIL BOTH ITEMS ENTER INTO THE ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION CARE IS ALSO TAKEN IN POINTING OUT IN THE RECENT CASE OSHKOSH WATER WORKS COMPANY VS THE CITY OF OSHKOSH 12 WRCR 602 608 609 THAT THESE ALLOWANCES ARE NOT FICTITIOUS THE ALLOWANCE UNDER DISCUSSION IS NOT MADE TO COVER FICTITIOUS EXPENSES SOMETHING BY WAY OF GOOD MEASURE AS IT WERE TO SWELL THE PHYSICAL VALUATION BUT IS DESIGNED TO COVER AS NEAR AS MAY BE ONLY THOSE EXPENSES WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE INCURRED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF A PLANT AND WHICH WOULD NOT OTHER WISE BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT THE ORIGINAL PLANT WAS BUILT UNDER CONTRACT WOULD ONLY GO TO SHOW THAT THE COMPANY MET THESE EXPENSES IN THE CONTRACT PRICE INSTEAD OF DIRECTLY AN EXPLANATION OF THIS ALLOWANCE IN A RECENT CASE BEFORE THE COMMISSION IS SO PERTINENT IN THIS CONNECTION THAT IT IS HERE QUOTED APART FROM THE EXPENSE OF LABOR AND MATERIAL INCURRED IN CONSTRUCT ING THE PLANT MANY ADDITIONAL COSTS MUST BE MET WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN THE APPRAISERS INVENTORY OF TANGIBLE PROPERTY AMONG THESE ARE THE EXPENSES OF ORGANIZATION PRELIMINARY TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE PROPERTY USUALLY CONSISTING OF ENGINEERING AND LEGAL EXPENSES THE EXPENSES OF SUPERVISING INCLUDING THE WAGES OF ALL CONTRACTORS SUPERINTENDENCE AND NECESSARY AD MINISTRATIVE ORGANIZATION CONTINGENT COSTS DUE TO LOSS OF TIME AND MATERIAL AND UNEXPECTED OBSTACLES OCCURRING DURING THE PROGRESS OF CONSTRUCTION AND FINALLY THE EXPENSES OF FINANCING THE CONSTRUCTION CONSISTING PRINCI PALLY OF INTEREST ON MONEY ADVANCED PRIOR TO OPERATION CONSTRUCTION COSTS OF THIS CHARACTER ARE ANALOGOUS TO THE OVERHEAD OR EXPENSE BURDEN ENCOUN TERED IN THE ANALYSIS OF OPERATING COSTS ALLOWANCES FOR SUCH EXPENDITURES ARE USUALLY MADE IN APPRAISALS OF PUBLIC UTILITY PROPERTIES AND HAVE IN ALL INSTANCES BEEN MADE BY THE COMMISSION IT IS NOTED THAT THE CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION IN THE CASE PALO ALTO VS PALO ALTO GAS COMPANY DECIDED MARCH 12 1913 ADDS 15 PER CENT AS AN OVERHEAD PERCENTAGE TO THE DETAILED APPRAISAL THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS WHICH IN EARLIER CASES ADOPTED 12 PER CENT AS THE PROPER PERCENTAGE ADDITION IN THE PASSAIC GAS CASE DECIDED DECEMBER 26 1912 PLACES THE ALLOWANCE AT 176 PER CENT THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION IN THE LINCOLN TELEPHONE CASE DECIDED JUNE 26 1913 STATES THE COMMISSION IS CONVINCED THAT THE AMOUNT OF 172 PER CENT FOR GENERAL EXPENDITURES ALLOWED BY OUR ENGINEERS IS CONSERVATIVE PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE MANNER IN WHICH THEY HAVE BUILT UP THEIR UNIT COST 223THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN THE BROOKLYN BOROUGH GAS CASE DECIDED JULY 8 1913 THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION FIRST DISTRICT EVIDENTLY PLACED THE PERCENTAGE ADDITION AT 154 PER CENT THE MUCH MOOTED QUESTION WHETHER THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW SHOULD BE DEPRECIATED HAS BEEN CONSIDERED IN VARIOUS CASES JUSTICE HUGHES IN DELIVERING THE OPINION OF THE COURT IN THE MINNESOTA RATE CASES 230 US 352 HOLDS THAT WHEN AN ESTIMATE OF VALUE IS BASED UPON THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW THE EXTENT OF EXISTING DEPRECIATION SHOULD BE SHOWN AND DEDUCTED THUS APPROVING THE RULE IN THE KNOX VILLE CASE 212 US 1 THE MASTER ALLOWED THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW WITHOUT DEDUCTION FOR DEPRECIATION IT WAS NOT DENIED THAT THERE WAS DEPRECIATION IN FACT BUT IT WAS FOUND THAT THIS DEPRECIATION WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY APPRECIATION THAT THE ROADBED WAS CONSTANTLY INCREASING IN VALUE THAT IT BECOMES SOLIDI FIED EMBANKMENTS AND SLOPES OR EXCAVATIONS BECOME SETTLED AND STABLE AND SO THE BETTER RESIST THE EFFECTS OF RAINS AND FROST THAT IT BECOMES ADJUSTED TO SURFACE DRAINAGE AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS MADE PERMANENT BY CONCRETE STRUCTURES AND RIPRAP AND THAT IN OTHER WAYS A ROADBED LONG IN USE IS FAR MORE VALU ABLE THAN ONE NEWLY CONSTRUCTED IT WAS SAID THAT A LARGE PART OF THE DE PRECIATION IS TAKEN CARE OF BY CONSTANT REPAIRS RENEWALS ADDITIONS AND REPLACE MENTS A SUFFICIENT SUM BEING ANNUALLY SET ASIDE AND DEVOTED TO THIS PURPOSE SO THAT THIS WITH THE APPLICATION OF ROADBED ADAPTATION TO THE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY AND OF THE PUBLIC SERVED TOGETHER WITH WORKING CAPITAL FULLY OFFSETS ALL DEPRECIATION AND RENDERS THE PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF THE ROAD NOT LESS VALUABLE THAN THEIR COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW AND IN A FURTHER STATEMENT UPON THE POINT THE KNOWLEDGE DERIVED FROM EXPERIENCE AND READINESS TO SERVE WERE MENTIONED AS ADDITIONAL OFFSETS WE CANNOT APPROVE THIS DISPOSITION OF THE MATTER OF DEPRECIATION  IT WOULD SEEM TO BE INEVITABLE THAT IN MANY PARTS OF THE PLANT THERE SHOULD BE SUCH DEPRECIATION AS FOR EXAMPLE IN OLD STRUCTURES AND EQUIPMENT REMAINING ON HAND AND WHEN AN ESTIMATE OF VALUE IS MADE ON THE BASIS OF REPRODUCTION NEW THE EXTENT OF EXISTING DEPRECIATION SHOULD BE SHOWN AND DEDUCTED  IF THERE ARE ITEMS ENTERING INTO THE ESTIMATE OF COST WHICH SHOULD BE CREDITED WITH APPRECIATION THIS ALSO SHOULD APPEAR SO THAT INSTEAD OF A BROAD COMPARI SON THERE SHOULD BE SPECIFIC FINDINGS SHOWING THE ITEMS WHICH ENTER INTO THE AC COUNT OF PHYSICAL VALUATION ON BOTH SIDES IT MUST BE REMEMBERED THAT WE ARE CONCERNED WITH A CHARGE OF CONFISCATION OF PROPERTY BY THE DENIAL OF A FAIR RETURN FOR ITS USE AND TO DETERMINE THE TRUTH OF THE CHARGE THERE IS SOUGHT TO BE ASCERTAINED THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THE REALIZATION OF THE BENEFITS OF PROPERTY MUST ALWAYS DEPEND IN LARGE DEGREE ON THE ABILITY AND SAGACITY OF THOSE WHO EMPLOY IT BUT THE APPRAISEMENT IS OF AN INSTRUMENT OF PUBLIC SERVICE AS PROPERTY NOT OF THE SKILL OF USERS AND WHEN PARTICULAR PHYSICAL ITEMS ARE ESTIMATED AS WORTH SO MUCH NEW IF IN FACT THEY BE DEPRECIATED THIS AMOUNT SHOULD BE FOUND AND ALLOWED FOR IF THIS IS 224TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING NOT DONE THE PHYSICAL VALUATION IS MANIFESTLY INCOMPLETE AND IT MUST BE REGARDED AS INCOMPLETE IN THIS CASE THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SECOND DISTRICT IN THE BUFFALO GAS COMPANY CASE DECIDED FEBRUARY 4 1913 EVIDENTLY PLACES LITTLE WEIGHT UPON THE COST OF REPRODUCTION VALUE AS A BASIS FOR RATE MAKING BUT RAISES AN INTERESTING QUESTION AS TO ITS ATTITUDE TO WARD THE KNOXVILLE RULE IF THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW WERE TO BE TAKEN AS THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE RATE IS TO BE COMPUTED WE WOULD LIKELY BE COMPELLED TO DEDUCT THEREFROM THE ACCRUED DEPRECIATION IN OBEDIENCE TO THE RULE LAID DOWN BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN KNOXVILLE VS KNOXVILLE WATER COMPANY 212 US 1 WHETHER WE CONSIDERED THAT RULE ECONOMICALLY SOUND OR OTHERWISE THE UNCERTAINTIES IN THIS CASE AS TO ORIGINAL COST AND COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW AS WELL AS TO THE ACTUAL CONDITION OF THE PHYSICAL PROPERTY MAKE A DISCUSSION OF THE PROPER HAND LING OF DEPRECIATION IN A RATE CASE ENTIRELY ACADEMIC IT IS CLEAR THAT THE TREAT MENT OF DEPRECIATION IN ANY GIVEN CASE DEPENDS UPON FACTS WHICH ARE NOT CLEAR IN THIS CASE AND TO LAY DOWN PRINCIPLES WHICH CANNOT BE APPLIED WOULD SERVE NO USEFUL END OUR VIEWS ON THIS IMPORTANT QUESTION WHICH WAS MUCH DISCUSSED DURING THE HEARINGS WILL BE MORE APPROPRIATE IN OTHER CASES BEFORE US IN WHICH THE FACTS ARE MORE CLEARLY ASCERTAINABLE THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION FIRST DISTRICT IN THE BROOKLYN BOROUGH GAS COMPANY CASE DECIDED JULY 8 1913 DOES NOT DEDUCT THE FULL ACCRUED DEPRECIATION IN DETERMINING A FAIR VALUE OF THE PROPERTY FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES THE ARGUMENT THAT A DEPRECIATED PLANT RENDERS SERVICE IDENTICAL WITH THAT OF A NEW PLANT AND THAT ITS VALUE FOR PURPOSES OF RATE MAKING SHOULD THEREFORE BE IDENTICAL IS ADVANCED IN THE RECENT DECISION OF THE MONTANA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION DECIDED NOVEMBER 3 1913  IT WILL BE OBVIOUS THAT THERE CAN BE NO FIXED PERCENTAGE OF DEPRE CIATION APPLICABLE TO A UTILITY THAT HAD BEEN KEPT UP FROM YEAR TO YEAR BY CONSTANT EFFORT AND THE PURCHASE OF IMPROVED DEVICES AS COMPARED WITH ONE THAT HAD BEEN ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE THROUGH NEGLECT HENCE THE PRINCIPLE OF AN ARBITRARILY ESTABLISHED MEASURE OF DEPRECIATION IS UNTENABLE  LET US ASSUME THAT AN INVESTMENT IS MADE IN 1903 OF 100000 UNDER A TWENTYYEAR FRAN CHISE RATE OF INTEREST ALLOWABLE 10 PER CENT PER ANNUM AND FIGURING 5 PER CENT PER ANNUM DEPRECIATION AT THE END OF TEN YEARS OR IN 1913 THE PROPERTY WILL HAVE DEPRECIATED 50000 AND HAS A REMAINING VALUE OF A LIKE AMOUNT THEN IF RATES ARE MADE BASED ON THE DEPRECIATED VALUE THEY MUST BE ONEHALF OF THE ORIGINAL RATES ALTHOUGH THE SERVICE MAY BE JUST AS EFFICIENT AS IT EVER WAS AND IN TEN YEARS MORE THE PHYSICAL VALUE OF THE PLANT WOULD BE NIL AND LIKEWISE UPON THE SAME BASIS OF REASONING THE UTILITY WOULD NOT BE PERMITTED TO CHARGE ANYTHING 225THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY A CONTRARY VIEW TO THIS PROPOSITION IS EXPRESSED BY THE CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION IN THE CASE PALO ALTO VS PALO ALTO GAS COM PANY DECIDED MARCH 12 1913 TO THE THEORY EXPRESSED THAT AS LONG AS A PLANT CAN DO ITS WORK IT SHOULD BE REGARDED FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES AS HAVING 100 PER CENT VALUE THIS COMMIS SION CANNOT GIVE ADHERENCE THE SAME VIEW IS EXPRESSED BY THE SUPREME COURT APPELLATE DIVI SION OF NEW YORK IN PEOPLE EX REL KINGS COUNTY LIGHTING COMPANY VS WILLCOX 141 NY SUPP 677 683 MR MATHEWSON AS AMICUS CURIAE FILES AN INTERESTING BRIEF PRESENTING AN ELABORATE ARGUMENT IN SUPPORT OF THE PROPOSITION THAT AS IT IS CONCEDED THAT THE PLANT OF THE RELATOR OPERATES AT 100 PER CENT OF EFFICIENCY THERE SHOULD BE NO DE DUCTION FOR SOCALLED ACCRUED DEPRECIATION THIS TERM IS USED TO DESIGNATE SOMEWHAT INARTIFICIALLY THE LIABILITY PRESENTLY ACCRUED TOWARD THE ULTIMATE COST OF REPLACEMENT OF STILL EFFICIENT APPARATUS HE THEREFORE REPUDIATES THE CONCESSION TO SCRAP VALUE AND CLAIMS THAT AS THE COMPANY BEING A PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION MUST ALWAYS KEEP ITS PLANT UP TO EFFICIENCY AND MUST REPLACE PROP ERTY WHEN WORN OUT IT IS ENTITLED TO A RATE BASED UPON 100 PER CENT EFFICIENCY BE CAUSE IT WILL NEVER BE ALLOWED TO CAPITALIZE REPLACEMENT BUT MUST PROVIDE IT WHEN NECESSARY IT THEREFORE MUST BE ALLOWED TO PROVIDE A REPLACEMENT FUND OUT OF ITS EARNINGS HE ARGUES THAT IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE TO THE CONSUMER WHETHER THAT FUND IS ACTUALLY ACCUMULATED AND ON HAND OR NOT BECAUSE THE REPLACEMENT MUST BE MADE IF THERE IS SUCH A FUND FROM IT IF NOT BY THE STOCK HOLDERS DIRECTLY IF ON THE OTHER HAND THE VALUATION OF THE TANGIBLES IS RE DUCED BY A PERCENTAGE IN THIS CASE 21 PER CENT IT CAN NEVER BE PROVIDED FOR IN THE ONLY PROPER WAYOUT OF EARNINGS WE ARE UNABLE TO ADOPT MR MATHEWSONS INTERESTING THEORIES FOR THESE REASONS 1 IT SEEMS TO BE THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT THE VALUE OF THE TANGIBLE PROPERTY UPON WHICH THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO A RATE WHICH WILL PROCURE A FAIR AND JUST RETURN IS THE PRESENT VALUE THAT IS AT THE TIME OF THE APPRAISEMENT FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES 2 THAT IN THE ABSENCE OF ACCURATE EVIDENCE AS TO ACTUAL VALUE THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW TAKES THE PLACE THEREOF 3 THAT AS THE PROPERTY BEING VALUED IS NOT NEW IN ORDER THAT COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW MAY REPRESENT THE ACTUAL CONDITIONTHE AMOUNT PRESENTLY INVESTEDTHERE MUST BE A DEDUCTION THEREFROM 4 THAT THIS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT REQUIRED TO REPLACE APPARATUS STILL IN USE BUT IN PROCESS OF WEARING OUT AT THE END OF USEFUL SERVICE 5 THAT THIS ALLOWANCE FOR DEPRECIATION HAS BEEN MADE IN VARIOUS KINDS OF CASES WHERE PRESENT VALUE IS REQUIRED TO BE ESTIMATED THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONERS IN APPLY ING THE KNOXVILLE RULE LIMITS ITS DEDUCTION IN THE PASSAIC GAS CASE DE 226TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING CIDED DECEMBER 26 1912 TO THE DEPRECIATION OBTAINED BY OBSERVATION AND INSPECTION A DEDUCTION SOMEWHAT IN EXCESS OF 4 PER CENT IT STATES IN SO FAR AS PHYSICAL PROPERTY IS CONCERNED IT APPEARS TO BE WELL SETTLED THAT THE PROPER VALUATION IS THE PRESENT VALUE AS OBTAINED BY DEDUCTING DEPRE CIATION WE ARE CONFRONTED HOWEVER WITH THE CONTRASTED METHODS OF ESTIMAT ING DEPRECIATION REFERRED TO ABOVE AND WE MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEORETICAL DEPRECIATION BY INSPECTION SHOULD BE DEDUCTED UNDOUBTEDLY AN ALLOWANCE FOR THEORETICAL DEPRECIATION WILL MUCH EXCEED THE DEPRECIATION OBTAINED IN THE OTHER WAY AND IN A LATER CASE GATELY AND HURLEY VS D  A T  T CO DE CIDED JANUARY 7 1913 THIS SAME COMMISSION ELABORATED UPON ITS REASONS FOR SUCH DEDUCTIONS THESE ARE IN SUBSTANCE THAT A PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATION IS INDEBTED TO THE UTILITY FOR CERTAIN REPLACEMENTS AND THAT THIS INDEBTEDNESS WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS CLEARLY INDICATE THAT IT CAN BE CARRIED OUT MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDER ATION WHEN DETERMINING THE VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES THE CONSIDERATIONS ADDUCED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH FAIL TO TAKE DUE COGNIZANCE OF THE FACT THAT A PUBLIC UTILITY LIES UNDER A PECULIAR OBLIGATION NOT SIMILARLY INCUMBENT UPON THE ORDINARY BUSINESS CONCERN THIS OBLIGATION CON SISTS IN THE CONTINUOUS REQUIREMENT OF PUTTING BACK INTO THE TANGIBLE EQUIPMENT SUCH ITEMS AS ARE NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME TO AFFORD TO CONSUMERS SERVICE IN QUALITY AND EXTENT EQUAL TO THE SERVICE WHICH COULD BE AFFORDED BY A BRAND NEW PLANT OF THE SAME MAGNITUDE THIS OBLIGATION TO REPLACE SAID ITEMS DOES NOT ALLOW THE PUBLIC UTILITY TO OBTAIN THE FUNDS THEREFOR FROM INCREASED RATES OR CHARGES NOR FROM THE ISSUE AND SALE OF ADDITIONAL SECURITIES  THE MAGNITUDE OF THE UTILITYS RESPONSIBILITY IS THEREFORE THE SUM OF THE UNEXPIRED SERVICE VALUE OF TANGIBLE PROPERTY PLUS THE PECUNIARY LIABILITY TO MAKE REPLACE MENTS AS NEEDED FROM ITS OWN POCKET AS ITS RESPONSIBILITY IS MEASURED BY A SUM IN EXCESS OF THE UNEXPIRED SERVICE VALUE OF ITS TANGIBLES IT WOULD SEEM TO US THAT THE EQUITABLE BASE UPON WHICH IT IS ENTITLED TO A RETURN IS IN EXCESS OF THE UNEXPIRED SERVICE VALUE OF ITS APPARATUS AND APPROACHES AS A LIMIT THE TOTAL REPLACEMENT COST NEW OF ITS TANGIBLE PROPERTY THE COMMISSION HOWEVER POINTS OUT THAT WHERE THERE IS GREATER ASSURANCE OF THE PROMPT AND ADEQUATE ADDITION OF NEEDED ITEMS OF REPLACEMENT SUCH AS IS POSSIBLE WHERE THE CORPORATION HAS ACCRUED A SUFFICIENT RESERVE LESS CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE DEDUCTION FOR ACCRUED DEPRECIATION THAN IS THE CASE WHERE THE CORPORATION SIMPLY LIES UNDER THE NAKED OBLIGATION TO MAKE SUCH REPLACEMENT AS REQUIRED SUCH A RULE IT HOLDS IS IN KEEPING WITH THE KNOXVILLE RULE 227THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WHILE THEREFORE IT MAY BE ONLY A FIRST APPROXIMATION TO JUSTICE IN DIS TINGUISHING BETWEEN UTILITIES OF THE TWO CONTRASTED CLASSES A DEDUCTION IN THE CASE OF THE LESS MERITORIOUS OR LESS CAPABLY PROJECTED UTILITY MAY WELL BE MADE WHERE SUCH DEDUCTION IS MODERATE IN EXTENT AND SERVES ONLY TO COVER SUCH EX PIRED SERVICE VALUE AS HAS RESULTED DEMONSTRABLY FROM AGE AND WEAR WE ARE OF OPINION THAT SAID DEDUCTION MAY FAIRLY BE MADE WHILE WE ARE NOT CONFIDENT THAT IN THE KNOXVILLE WATER CASE THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HAD BEFORE IT ANY RECORD OF EACH AND EVERY CONSIDERATION PROPERLY TO BE CONSIDERED IN THE MATTER OF MAKING DEDUCTIONS FROM THE REPLACEMENT VALUE NEW OF TAN GIBLE PROPERTY IT IS TOLERABLY CLEAR THAT THIS DEDUCTION OR ABATEMENT HERE PRO POSED IS WHOLLY IN KEEPING WITH THE VALUATION RULE THAT SEEMINGLY MAY BE DE DUCED FROM THAT OPINION SUCH ABATEMENT OR DEDUCTION IS ONLY A FRACTION OF THE TOTAL EXPIRED SERVICE VALUE OF TANGIBLE PROPERTY IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THIS MODERATE REDUCTION HAS ALSO THIS ADVANTAGE THAT IT IS BASED UPON CER TAINLY ASCERTAINED INSPECTION OR INVESTIGATION AND NOT UPON THE MORE OR LESS CONJECTURAL ALLOWANCES FOR DEPRECIATION ESTIMATED BY TABLES PURPORTING TO GIVE THE EXPECTATION OF LIFE OF VARIOUS PARTS OF THE UTILITYS PLANT SUCH ALSO HAS BEEN THE FINDING OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC SERV ICE COMMISSION IN THE BERLIN ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY CASE DECIDED AUGUST 30 1913 WE DO NOT HOLD THAT THE FULL AMOUNT OF DEPRECIATION SHOULD IN EVERY CASE BE DEDUCTED FROM THE COST OF REPRODUCTION IT IS MERELY ONE OF THE FACTS TO BE CONSIDERED IN MAKING A FINDING OF FAIR VALUE IT STANDS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS ORIGINAL COST OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OTHER NECESSARY EARLY EXPENDITURES PRESENT REPRODUCTION COST OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND OTHER FACTS CONCERNING WHICH INQUIRY IS MADE ALL OF WHICH SHOULD BE DETERMINED AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE BUT NONE OF WHICH HAS A UNIFORM FIXED VALUE IN EACH CASE THERE MAY BE CASES WHERE PLANTS WELL CONCEIVED AND WELL MANAGED HAVE SUFFERED DEPRECIATION WHICH IN FACT REPRESENTS A PART OF THE COST OF DEVELOPING THE BUSINESS TO A POINT WHERE A FAIR RETURN CAN BE SECURED IN OTHER CASES AS FOR EXAMPLE WHERE ADEQUATE RETURNS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED TO AFFORD A FAIR RETURN AND TO MAINTAIN A DEPRECIA TION RESERVE BUT HAVE BEEN ENTIRELY PAID OUT IN DIVIDENDS THE ENTIRE AMOUNT MAY PROPERLY BE DEDUCTED FROM PRESENT COST OF REPRODUCTION IN COMING TO THE FINAL CONCLUSION AS TO FAIR VALUE BETWEEN THESE TWO EXTREMES THE PROPER COURSE WILL VARY ACCORDING TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IN EACH CASE BUT IN EVERY CASE IT IS DESIRABLE TO DETERMINE FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONSIDERATION THE FULL DEPRECIATION AS ACCURATELY AS POSSIBLE A SIMILAR RULE CONVERSELY STATED THAT THE DEPRECIATION FUND OF THE CORPORATION IS PROPERLY AN ASSET OF THE UTILITY TO BE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IS THAT HELD BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF ARIZONA IN THE CASE WM P BONBRIGHT ET AL VS W P GEARY ET AL A CASE ON APPEAL FROM 228TENDNCISSI IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING THE RULING OF THE CORPORATION COMMISSION OF ARIZONA IN THE PHOENIX CASE DATED NOVEMBER 19 1913 THIS BRINGS US TO A PECULIAR FEATURE OF THIS CASE THERE WAS ON HAND IN THE TREASURY OF THE COMPANY AT THE TIME OF THE VALUATION OF THE PLANT THE SUM OF 6429267 ACCUMULATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEETING THE EXPENSE OF CURRENT RE PAIRS AND FOR REPLACING SUCH PARTS OF THE PROPERTY AS HAD BEEN WORN OUT AND THE LIFE OF THE PART ENDED THE FUND HAD BEEN WITHHELD FROM THE STOCKHOLDERS THAT IT MIGHT BE USED IN PRESERVING THE PLANT IN GOOD CONDITION AND IN PROPER EFFI CIENCY THIS WAS GOOD BUSINESS JUDGMENT ON THE PART OF THE OFFICERS OF THE COR PORATION AND MUST BE APPROVED PUBLIC SERVICE CORPORATIONS ARE TO BE ENCOUR AGED IN MAINTAINING THEIR PLANTS IN A PROPER STATE OF EFFICIENCY WE ARE OF THE OPINION THAT THE CORPORATION COMMISSION WAS IN ERROR IN ITS ESTIMATE OF DE PRECIATION OF THIS PLANT AND PARTICULARLY WAS IN ERROR IN OMITTING THIS FUND FROM ITS VALUATION OF THE PLANT THIS ALSO IT APPEARS HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE WISCONSIN RAILROAD COMMISSION IN ITS RATE CASES A NOTABLE DEPARTURE IN THE RECENT DECISIONS FROM WHAT HITHERTO HAD ALMOST UNIFORMLY BEEN THE RULE WITH STATE COMMISSIONS RELATES TO THE INCLUSION OF THE COST OF REMOVING AND RELAYING PAVING OVER ALL MAINS IN ANY DETERMINATION OF THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW AL THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT SUCH AN ALLOWANCE HAD BEEN SPECIFICALLY MADE IN THE CONSOLIDATED GAS COMPANY CASE 157 FED 849 AND THAT SUCH REVISIONS HAD BEEN AFFIRMED IN 212 US 19 COMMISSIONS SUCH AS NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SECOND DISTRICT IN THE BUFFALO GAS CASE FEBRUARY 4 1913 NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMIS SIONERS IN THE PASSAIC GAS CASE DECEMBER 26 1912 AND THE WISCONSIN RAILROAD COMMISSION IN CITY OF ASHLAND VS ASHLAND WATER COMPANY 4 WRCR 273 306308 AND CASES FOLLOWING HAVE CITED AND EVIDENTLY FOLLOWED THE EXAMPLE OF EXCLUDING SUCH PAVING COST IN CEDAR RAPIDS GAS LIGHT COMPANY VS CITY OF CEDAR RAPIDS 120 NW REP 966 970 AND LIMITED THE ALLOWANCE FOR PAVING TO THE COSTS ACTUALLY IN CURRED BY THE UTILITY AND EXCLUDED PAVING LAID SUBSEQUENT TO THE LAY ING OF MAINS IN A CASE ON APPEAL FROM A DECISION OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERV ICE COMMISSION FIRST DISTRICT THE NEW YORK SUPREME COURT APPELLATE DIVISION IN PEOPLE VS WILLCOX 141 NY SUPP 677 681 HAS HELD THAT SUCH ALLOWANCES ARE PROPERLY INCLUDED IN THE VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES CITING THE CONSOLIDATED GAS COMPANY CASES JUSTICE CLARKE SPEAKING FOR THE COURT STATES 229THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IT SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO REGARD THAT QUESTION AS SETTLED THE FACT THAT THESE STREETS HAVE BEEN PAVED AND THE REGION GENERALLY IMPROVED HAS CAUSED SALES OF LAND THE BUILDING OF HOUSES AND THE INCREASE IN POPULATION WHICH HAVE ENABLED THE COMPANY WITHIN THE LAST FEW YEARS TO MAKE PROFITS AND DECLARE DIVIDENDS WHICH FOR MANY YEARS IT WAS UNABLE TO DO THE ARGUMENT THAT STREETS PAVED OR UNPAVED MAKE NO DIFFERENCE IN THE EARNING POWER OF A GAS COMPANY IS UNSOUND THE EARNING POWER OF A GAS PLANT DEPENDS UPON ITS CONSTITUENCY IF IT HAS NOBODY TO SELL GAS TO IT CAN MAKE NO PROFITS AND IF THERE ARE NO DECENT STREETS THERE WILL BE FEW PEOPLE THE VALUE OF A PLANT OF ANY KIND IS CERTAINLY AFFECTED BY ITS LOCATION AND THE DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS IF A NEW COMPANY UNDERTOOK TO INSTALL A DUPLICATE PLANT THE COST OF REPAVING UNDER THE PRESENT STREETS WOULD PROPERLY BE ALLOWED FOR HENCE IT IS A NECESSARY ELEMENT OF RE PRODUCTION VALUE IT IS A VALUABLE ADVANTAGE WHICH THE PRESENT OWNER HAS WHICH A PROSPECTIVE BUYER WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR LIKE INCREASED LAND VALUES A SCHOOL OF THOUGHT MIGHT CONDEMN IT AS UNEARNED INCREMENT BUT THE LAW DOES NOT YET REFUSE TO INCLUDE IT IN ITS DEFINITION OF PROPERTY CAPABLE OF OWNER SHIP AND ENTITLED TO PROTECTION SUCH AN ALLOWANCE IS ALSO AFFIRMED BY THE WISCONSIN SUPREME COURT IN APPLETON WATER WORKS COMPANY VS RAILROAD COMMISSION 154 WIS 121 BUT THERE IS EXCLUDED PAVING OVER SERVICE PIPES UPON THE THEORY THAT SUCH PAVING WOULD UNDER COMMON PRACTICES BE LAID BY CUSTOMERS OF A NEW PLANT COST OF REPRODUCTION MUST MEAN THE COST WHICH WILL BE NECESSARILY INCURRED BY A REASONABLY PRUDENT AND CAREFUL MAN USING ORDINARILY CAREFUL BUSINESS METHODS IN REPRODUCING A PLANT OF EQUAL EFFICIENCY ANYTHING WHICH UNDER SUCH A CONDUCT OF THE BUSINESS WOULD COST NOTHING TO REPRODUCE CANNOT LOGICALLY BE INCLUDED IT IS NOT DENIED THAT IF THE CITY OR A NEW WATER COMPANY WERE TO ES TABLISH A NEW PLANT THE CONSUMERS COULD BE REQUIRED AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING WATER SERVICE TO DO THE WORK IN QUESTION AND EVEN FURNISH THE PIPE   SO IT SEEMS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO QUESTION BUT THAT IT WOULD BE ENTIRELY PRAC TICABLE AND IN FACT THE ONLY REASONABLY PRUDENT POLICY FOR A NEW COMPANY TO REQUIRE CONSUMERS TO LAY THEIR OWN SERVICE PIPES THIS IS NOT THE CASE WHERE LAND OR OTHER PROPERTY OF VALUE HAS BEEN VOLUN TARILY DONATED TO THE OLD COMPANY WITH REGARD TO SUCH PROPERTY IT HAS BEEN HELD IN CASES INVOLVING THE FIXING OF RATES THAT IT IS RIGHTFULLY TO BE CONSIDERED IN ARRIVING AT THE COST OF REPRODUCTION THIS RESULT IS REACHED ON THE IDEA THAT A NEW COMPANY COULD NOT COUNT ON RECEIVING SUCH GIFTS WHETHER THE LOGIC OF THESE CASES BE CORRECT OR NOT WE DO NOT DECIDE BUT IN ANY EVENT THE PRINCIPLE DOES NOT APPLY TO EXPENSES WHICH MAY LEGALLY BE ASSESSED AND IN THE EXERCISE OF GOOD BUSINESS JUDGMENT OUGHT TO BE ASSESSED AGAINST THE CONSUMER FOR PURCHASE PURPOSES AT LEAST THE ONLY EXPENSES WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THE ESTIMATE OF THE COST OF REPRODUCTION ARE THOSE WHICH ARE REASONABLY NECESSARY IN A PRUDENTLY CONDUCTED REPRODUCTION THE PRINCIPLE OF INCLUDING THE COST OF REMOVING AND RELAYING ALL PAVING IS ACCEPTED AS PROBABLY SETTLED IN THIS STATE BY THE WISCONSIN RAIL 230TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING ROAD COMMISSION IN THE OSHKOSH WATER WORKS CASE 12 WRCR 602 662 SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THE INCLUSION OF THE COST OF DISTURBING PAVING IN THE VALUE OF PIPE IS THE QUESTION OF APPRECIATION OF REAL ESTATE IT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION FIRST DISTRICT TO ALLOW THE PRESENT VALUE OF REAL ESTATE IN ITS VALUATION FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES BUT TO INCLUDE ALSO THE ANNUAL APPRECIATION AS INCOME IT IS A MATTER OF PARTICULAR INTEREST THAT THE STATE SUPREME COURT APPELLATE DIVISION PEOPLE VS WILLCOX 141 NY SUPP 677 687 HAS PLACED ITS STAMP OF DISAPPROVAL UPON THIS THEORY IN ITS CALCULATION OF INCOME HOWEVER IT HAS INCLUDED AN ITEM OF 35000 AS THE ANNUAL INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE LAND OF THE COMPANY THIS WE REGARD AS ERRONEOUS THE LAND IS USED FOR THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY AND IS APPRO PRIATE THEREFOR SO LONG AS THE LAND IS HELD AND USED FOR SUCH PURPOSE INCREASE IN VALUE CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS INCOME OR AS AVAILABLE FOR THE PAYMENT OF DEBTS TAXES OR DIVIDENDS WHILE IT APPEARS THAT THE CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION HAS NOT ADOPTED A SIMILAR PRACTICE DICTA IN A RECENT CASE APPLICATION OF NORTH COAST WATER COMPANY DECIDED DECEMBER 3 1913 SEEM TO INDICATE THAT IT HAS GIVEN THE MATTER CONSIDERATION COMMISSIONER THELEN STATES WHILE IT IS NOT NECESSARY TO DECIDE THIS POINT HERE FOR REASONS WHICH WILL HEREINAFTER APPEAR I DESIRE AT THIS POINT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THIS QUESTION OF THE VALUE TO BE ASSIGNED TO LAND IN RATEFIXING INQUIRIES WHICH QUESTION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT WHICH CAN POSSIBLY ARISE IN A RATEFIXING INQUIRY THIS QUESTION TESTS SQUARELY THE CORRECTNESS OF THE SOCALLED REPRODUCTION VALUE OR PRESENT VALUE THEORIES ON THE ONE HAND AND THE ORIGINAL COST OR INVESTMENT THEORY ON THE OTHER IN THIS CONNECTION I DESIRE TO REFER TO THE LANGUAGE OF MR JUSTICE VAN FLEET IN SAN DIEGO WATER COMPANY VS SAN DIEGO 118 CAL 556 WHO EXPRESSES WHAT HE BELIEVES TO BE THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND A PUBLIC UTILITY WHICH IS ONE OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT AT PAGE 570 MR JUSTICE VAN FLEET SAYS AS WE HAVE SAID IT IS NOT THE WATER OR THE DISTRIBUTING WORKS WHICH THE COMPANY MAY BE SAID TO OWN AND THE VALUE OF WHICH IS TO BE ASCERTAINED THEY WERE ACQUIRED AND CONTRIBUTED FOR THE USE OF THE PUBLIC THE PUBLIC MAY BE SAID TO BE THE REAL OWNER AND THE COMPANY ONLY THE AGENT OF THE PUBLIC TO ADMINISTER THEIR USE     IT IS THE MONEY REASONABLY AND PROPERLY EXPENDED IN THE ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE WORKS ACTUALLY AND PROP ERLY IN USE FOR THAT PURPOSE WHICH CONSTITUTES THE INVESTMENT ON WHICH THE COMPENSATION IS TO BE COMPUTED 231THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE FOREGOING CONCLUSION WAS WORKED OUT BY MR JUSTICE VAN FLEET LOGI CALLY AND ON PRINCIPLE FROM THE FUNDAMENTAL RELATIONSHIP EXISTING BETWEEN THE PUBLIC AND ITS PUBLIC UTILITIES THE USE OF THE PRESENT VALUE OR REPRODUCTION VALUE THEORIES DOES NOT SPRING IN ANYWAY OUT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP AND HAS NO NECESSARY CONNECTION WITH IT AS MR JUSTICE VAN FLEET CLEARLY POINTS OUT THE USE OF EITHER THE PRESENT VALUE OR THE REPRODUCTION VALUE THEORIES MAY BE AS CLEARLY UNJUST TO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES ON THE ONE HAND IN CASE PRICES HAVE GONE DOWN AS IT IS TO THE PUBLIC ON THE OTHER HAND IN CASE PRICES HAVE GONE UP IN LOGIC AND JUSTICE THE PUBLIC UTILITY SHOULD RECEIVE A RETURN ON THE MONEYS REA SONABLY AND PROPERLY EXPENDED IN THE ACQUISITION AND CONSTRUCTION OF ITS WORKS ACTUALLY AND PROPERLY IN USE TO CARRY OUT ITS AGENCYNO MORE AND NO LESS IF CARE IS EXERCISED IN THUS ASCERTAINING THE VALUATION ON WHICH A RETURN IS TO BE ALLOWED AND IF A LIBERAL RETURN IS THEN ALLOWED ON THAT BASIS AS IS THE PRACTICE OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION THE UTILITY WILL BE RECEIVING FULL JUSTICE WHILE THE CON SUMER ON THE OTHER HAND WILL BE PAYING NO MORE THAN HE OUGHT REASONABLY TO BE CALLED UPON TO PAY TO HIS AGENT THE UNEARNED INCREMENT HAS ALSO BEEN REFERRED TO AS A FACTOR OF VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES BY THE MASSACHUSETTS BOARD OF GAS AND ELECTRIC LIGHT COMMISSIONERS IN THE ATTLEBOROUGH PETITION DECIDED FEBRUARY 7 1913 AND HAS IN EFFECT BEEN EXPANDED UNTIL IT COMPRISES THE WHOLE SINGLE TAX THEORY THERE IS A GROWING RECOGNITION OF THE TRUTH OF THE PROPOSITION THAT A PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY IS NOT ENTITLED TO A RETURN UPON THE UNEARNED INCREMENT IN VALUE OF ITS REAL ESTATE BUT INVESTMENT OUT OF PROFITS WHICH IT HAS BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOLELY THROUGH THE GENERAL GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY WHICH IT SERVES HAS MANY SIMILAR ATTRIBUTES IT WILL COMMONLY BE FOUND THAT A COMPANYS SURPLUS IS BASED ON MANAGERIAL SKILL AND FORESIGHT NEEDLESSLY HIGH RATES OR THE GENERAL PROSPERITY OF THE COMMUNITY OR MORE FREQUENTLY ON TWO OR MORE OF THESE COM BINED AND WHILE IT MAY BE DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHAT PROPORTION IS JUSTLY AT TRIBUTABLE TO ANY ONE OF THESE CAUSES THERE CAN BE LITTLE QUESTION THAT THE GEN ERAL GROWTH OF THE COMMUNITY IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR   IT IS DIFFICULT TO SEE WHY THE REASONABLE AMOUNT OF RETURN OR THE REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN BASED UPON THE FULL VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PROPERTY SHOULD NOT BE AFFECTED IN THE SAME MANNER BY THAT PORTION OF THE INVESTMENT MADE FROM WHAT MAY BE TERMED THE UNEARNED INCREMENT IN ITS PROFITS AS BY THE UNEARNED INCREMENT OF VALUE IN ITS REAL ESTATE IN OTHER WORDS THE REASONABLE RATE OF RETURN UPON A COMPANYS ENTIRE INVESTMENT IS LOWER WHERE AN APPRECIABLE PART IS DERIVED FROM THE TWO SOURCES DESCRIBED THAN WHERE IT IS ENTIRELY DERIVED FROM THE CONTRIBU TIONS OF THE SHAREHOLDERS IN THEIR PAYMENTS FOR ITS STOCK TO THESE THEORIES THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION SECOND DISTRICT HAS EXPRESSED DISSENT IN THE BUFFALO GAS CASE DECIDED FEB RUARY 4 1913 232TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING     WHAT IS CALLED THE FIXING OF THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY IN THE PUBLIC SERVICE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RATE MAKING IS NOT A FIXING OF VALUE IN ANY PROPER SENSE OF THAT WORD AS IT IS CORRECTLY USED IN OUR LANGUAGE IT IS A DETERMINATION OF WHAT UNDER ALL THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE CASE IS A JUST AND EQUITABLE AMOUNT UPON WHICH THE RETURN ALLOWED TO THE CORPORATION IS TO BE COMPUTED IF THE TIME THE DETERMINATION IS MADE HAPPENS TO BE AT OR NEAR THE TIME THE PLANT IS PUT IN OPERATION THE INVESTMENT OR ORIGINAL COST MAY BE THE PREDOMI NANT FACTOR IF THE TIME OF DETERMINATION IS REMOTE FROM THE TIME OF INVEST MENT THE FACTOR OF APPRECIATION OR DIMINUTION IN VALUES ARISING FROM CHANGES IN COSTS OF LABOR AND MATERIALS MAY ENTER LARGELY INTO THE RESULT IF THE PLANT IS UNREASONABLY DISPROPORTIONATE IN SIZE TO THE SERVICE REQUIRED OF IT THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW CANNOT BE THE SOLE TEST IF THE ACTUAL INVESTMENT HAS BEEN RECKLESS AND EXTRAVAGANT THE OWNERS SHOULD BEAR THE LOSS AND NOT THE PUBLIC IF THE GENERAL SCALE OF PRICES AND VALUES IN THE COMMUNITY HAS BEEN INCREASED OR DIMINISHED SINCE THE PLANT WAS BUILT THE OWNERS MAY BE FAIRLY CALLED UPON TO SHARE THE GENERAL DIMINUTION AND ON THE OTHER HAND MAY JUSTLY DEMAND A SHARE IN THE GENERAL APPRECIATION TO WHICH THE EXISTENCE OF THEIR PROPERTY HAS IT MAY FAIRLY BE ASSUMED CONTRIBUTED AT LEAST ITS PROPORTIONATE SHARE AND THIS CONCLUSION IS SUBSTANTIATED IN FUHRMANN VS THE CATARACT POWER AND CONDUIT COMPANY DECIDED APRIL 2 1913 WHEREIN THE COMMISSION POINTS OUT THAT IT DECLINED TO RECOGNIZE OR CAPITALIZE PAST DEFICITS UPON THE GROUND THAT IT PRODUCED THE SOMEWHAT CURIOUS RESULT THAT THE GREATER THE LOSS THE GREATER THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY A SIMILAR FINDING IS MADE BY THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSIONERS IN THE PASSAIC GAS CASE  IF IN THE PAST THIS GAS COMPANY OUT OF THE RATES EXACTED FROM CONSUMERS HAD MET ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND DEPRECIATION AND IN ADDITION THERETO HAD OBTAINED ENOUGH TO PAY RETURNS TO INVESTORS AND TO BUILD AN ACTUAL STRUCTURE USED IN THE BUSINESS WOULD THIS STRUCTURE AFORESAID BE THE LAWFUL PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY THE ANSWER IT SEEMS TO US MUST BE IN THE AFFIRM ATIVE IF THE COMPANY HAD PAID OUT IN ADDITION TO OTHER PAYMENTS TO INVESTORS DIVIDENDS EQUAL TO THE COST OF BUILDING THIS STRUCTURE AND THEN HAD ISSUED AD DITIONAL STOCK IN VALUE EQUAL TO THE COST OF THIS STRUCTURE IN ORDER TO REPOSSESS ITSELF OF THE MONEY REQUIRED TO BUILD IT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT THE STRUCTURE BUILT OUT OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES THUS SOLD WOULD BE THE LAW FUL PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY IT WOULD BE NONE THE LESS THE COMPANYS LAWFUL PROPERTY IF BUILT OUT OF CURRENT EARNINGS WITHOUT THE ISSUE OF ADDITIONAL SECURI TIES    IT IS TRUE THAT THE COST OF NEW BUSINESS IN THIS LAST DECADE HAS BEEN CHARGED TO OPERATION AND PAID OUT OF RATES BUT AS WE HAVE INDICATED ABOVE THE BUSINESS THUS ACQUIRED MUST BE REGARDED AS A LEGITIMATE PART OF THE PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY WE CANNOT EQUITABLY PROJECT BACK INTO THE UN REGULATED PAST A NORM OF PRICES THAT MIGHT TODAY BE REGARDED AS FAIR AND ADE QUATE AND ASSUME THAT ACTUAL RATES EXACTED IN THE PAST IN SO FAR AS THEY EX CEED WHAT ARE NOW DEEMED FAIR HAVE NOT LAWFULLY BECOME THE PROPERTY OF THE 233THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY COMPANY IF THESE HIGH RATES IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE AN INTANGIBLE PROPERTY IN THE SHAPE OF EXTENSIVE PATRONAGE THAT EXPECTATION OF PATRONAGE IS THEIRS AND ON ITS FAIR VALUE THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO A RETURN IT MAY OR MAY NOT BE A SUBJECT OF REGRET THAT REGULATION WAS SO LONG DEFERRED BUT DEFERRED REGULATION IS NO EXCUSE FOR REFUSING AT PRESENT TO ALLOW A FAIR RETURN UPON WHAT IS THE LAWFUL PROPERTY OF THE COMPANY AND THESE CONCLUSIONS SEEM TO BE ESTABLISHED IN THE DECISION IN THE MINNESOTA RATE CASES 230 US 352 454 THERE IS NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE EFFECT OF CARRYING THE THEORY OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION THAN THAT PRESENTED IN THE SUPERIOR CASE DECIDED BY THE WISCONSIN COMMISSION ON NOVEMBER 13 1912 IT APPEARS THAT THE REAL ESTATE WAS PURCHASED AND A LARGE SIZED PLANT CONSTRUCTED DURING A BOOM PERIOD AND THAT NO MORE PROPERTY WAS PURCHASED THAN WAS ACTUALLY NECESSARY AT THE TIME NOR GREATER AMOUNTS PAID THAN THE PREVAILING MARKET PRICES EXPENDI TURES MEASURED BY STANDARDS AT THAT TIME WERE APPARENTLY LEGITIMATE AND NECESSARY THE SUBSEQUENT SLOW PERIOD OF RECOVERY AFTER THE PANIC IN 1893 DEVELOPED LARGE DEFICITS UPON THE ACTUAL INVESTMENT IT IS SIGNIFICANT THAT THE COMMISSIONS RULING IS A CITATION TO A CASE IN WHICH IT HAD OCCASION TO RECOGNIZE APPRECIATION RATHER THAN DEPRECIA TION OF LAND VALUES THIS COMMISSION HAS HAD OCCASION IN FORMER CASES TO PASS UPON THE QUESTION OF APPRECIATION OF LAND VALUES IT WAS HELD IN THE MADISON CASE THAT THE LAW AS WELL AS OUR SOCIAL SYSTEM RECOGNIZES SUCH GAINS IN PRAC TICALLY ALL OTHER UNDERTAKINGS IS EVIDENT FROM THE FACT THAT RENTS AND INTEREST CHARGES USUALLY VARY WITH THE NATURAL INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY THEY COVER AS THE COST OF REPRODUCTION OF A PLANT USUALLY PLAYS PERHAPS THE MOST IM PORTANT PART IN DETERMINING ITS VALUE IT IS MORE THAN LIKELY THAT THE OWNERS WOULD HAVE TO BEAR LOSSES IN CASE LAND AND OTHER PROPERTY HAD DEPRECIATED IN STEAD OF APPRECIATED IT WOULD SEEM ONLY JUST THAT THE RULE WOULD WORK BOTH WAYS  IN VIEW OF THESE FACTS THERE WOULD SEEM TO BE GOOD GROUND FROM BOTH A LEGAL AND ECONOMIC VIEWPOINT FOR GIVING SUCH APPRECIATIONS IN VALUE CONSIDERATION IN APPRAISING PUBLIC UTILITIES AT ANY RATE WE CANNOT NOW SEE GOOD REASONS UPON WHICH TO EXCLUDE THESE ELEMENTS FROM THE APPRAISAL OF UTILITY PROPERTIES STATE JOURNAL PRTG CO V8 MADISON G  EL CO 1910 4 WRCR 501 579 ORIGINAL COST OR INVESTMENT IS RECOGNIZED AS AN IMPORTANT IF NOT DETERMINING FACTOR IN THE CASES OF THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COM MISSION SECOND DISTRICT IN THE BUFFALO GAS AND THE CATARACT POWER AND CONDUIT COMPANY CASES IT HAS LIKEWISE EVIDENTLY BEEN GIVEN 234TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING CONSIDERATION IN THE DECISION OF THE WISCONSIN COMMISSION IN THE MILWAUKEE FARE CASES 10 WRCR 1 THE EXCLUSION OF GOING VALUE AS AN ELEMENT OF THE VALUE FOR RATE MAKING BY THE NEW YORK PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION FIRST DISTRICT IS RULED TO BE IN ERROR BY THE STATE SUPREME COURT APPELLATE DIVISION IN KINGS COUNTY VS WILLCOX 141 NY SUPP 677 681 JUSTICE CLARKE POINTS OUT THAT WHILE IT IS TRUE THAT THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT HAS NOT DIRECTLY DECIDED THE PROPRIETY OF INCLUDING GOING VALUE IN FIXING THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY OF A PUBLIC UTILITY FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IT HAS DONE SO IN PURCHASE CASES I AM UNABLE TO PERCEIVE A LOGICAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ALLOWING GOING VALUE IN THE VALUATION OF A PLANT WHEN IT IS TO BE TAKEN ENTIRELY BY THE PUBLIC AND ALLOWING THE SAME ELEMENT WHEN VALUING THE SAME PLANT FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IN EACH CASE THE THING TO BE DONE IS THE FAIR APPRAISEMENT OF PRESENT VALUE WHAT DIFFERENCE IN PRINCIPLE CAN THERE BE BECAUSE IN ONE INSTANCE ALL IS TAKEN FOR THE USE OF THE PUBLIC AND IN THE OTHER THE PUBLIC LIMITS THE EARN INGS IN THE CASE AT BAR THE COMMISSION SAYS IT DISALLOWED THIS CLAIM IN DETERMINING FAIR VALUE  BUT DID CONSIDER IT IN FIXING THE RATE OF RETURN IF SO THERE IS NO PROOF OF THAT FACT IN THE RECORD THE BASIS OF DETERMINING GOING COST OR VALUE BY PAST DEFICITS LAID DOWN BY THE WISCONSIN COMMISSION IN THE ANTIGO CASE 3 WRCR 623 IS EVIDENTLY ACCEPTED BY THE CALIFORNIA AND NEW JERSEY COMMIS SIONS THE CALIFORNIA RAILROAD COMMISSION IN THE CASE PALO ALTO VS PALO ALTO GAS COMPANY DECIDED MARCH 12 1913 WHILE RECOGNISING SUCH COSTS RESERVES DECISION AS TO WHETHER THIS ELEMENT OF VALUE SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT OR AMORTIZED IN THE NEAR FUTURE IT STATES THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED IN DEVELOPING THE BUSINESS DURING ITS EARLY STAGES FOR WHICH COSTS THE UTILITY IS ENTITLED TO BE REIMBURSED JUST AS CLEARLY AS IT IS ENTITLED TO A RETURN ON THE PHYSICAL PORTIONS OF ITS PLANT SEEMS TO BE TOO OBVIOUS FOR ARGUMENT THE INVESTOR MUST GO INTO HIS POCKET TO MEET ONE KIND OF COST AS CLEARLY AS THE OTHER THERE ARE TWO SCHOOLS OF THOUGHT WITH REFERENCE TO THE MANNER IN WHICH THE SOCALLED GOING CONCERN VALUE OR DEVELOPMENT COST SHOULD BE MET THE SUPPORTERS OF ONE SCHOOL ARE OF THE VIEW THAT THESE ITEMS SHOULD BE ADDED TO CAPITAL ACCOUNT WHILE THOSE OF THE OTHER SCHOOL BELIEVE THAT THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF BY RATES HIGHER THAN WOULD OTHERWISE BE IN EFFECT DURING THE FIRST YEARS OF THE UTILITYS EX ISTENCE THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE FIRST VIEW IS THAT ITS ADOPTION WILL RESULT IN THE INCREASE OF THE PERMANENT CAPITAL ACCOUNT AND THE CONSEQUENT PAYMENT OF HIGHER RATES FOR ALL TIME TO COME THE DIFFICULTY WITH THE LATTER VIEW IS THAT IT CASTS UPON THE PATRONS DURING THE FIRST YEARS THE DUTY OF PAYING RATES EVEN 235THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY HIGHER THAN THE USUAL RELATIVELY HIGH RATES WHICH ARE PAID AT THE OUTSET OF A UTILITYS HISTORY I AM OF THE OPINION THAT SUCH COSTS LEGITIMATELY AND WISELY INCURRED SHOULD BE TAKEN CARE OF IN SOME WAY BUT THE EXACT METHOD TO BE PUR SUED AND THE EXTENT TOWHICH CONSIDERATION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO SUCH ITEMS WILL DEPEND UPON THE FACTS OF EACH PARTICULAR CASE IT MIGHT WELL BE FOR INSTANCE THAT IF THE UTILITY IS UNWISELY CONCEIVED OR STRUGGLES AGAINST UNUSUAL DIFFICULTIES THE COST OF DEVELOPING THE BUSINESS INCLUDING THE EARLY LOSSES MAY RUN UP TO ALMOST THE ENTIRE VALUE OF THE PHYSICAL PLANT IF NOT IN EXCESS THEREOF IT MAY HAPPEN ALSO THAT WHILE IN ONE CASE THE ADDITION OF THESE COSTS TO CAPITAL AC COUNT MIGHT BE PERFECTLY FAIR IN ANOTHER CASE JUSTICE WILL REQUIRE THAT THESE COSTS BE REIMBURSED OUT OF HIGHER RATES DURING THE FIRST FEW YEARS OR THAT SOME COMBINATION OF THESE THEORIES BE ADOPTED GOING COST IS RECOGNIZED AS A PROPER ADDITION TO THE RATEMAKING VALUE BY THE NEW JERSEY BOARD OF PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSIONERS IN THE CASE GATELY  HURLEY VS D  A T  T CO DECIDED JANUARY 7 1913 AND IN THE PASSAIC GAS CASE DECIDED DECEMBER 26 1912 AND SUCH INCLUSION HAS BEEN AFFIRMED IN THE APPEAL CASE 87 ATL NJ 651 DECIDED ON JULY 1 1913 IN THE FORMER CASE THE COMMISSION STATED   IT APPEARS JUST AND REASONABLE THAT A FAIR PRESENT DAY ESTIMATE OF THE CAPITAL NECESSARILY AND JUDICIOUSLY SUNK IN ESTABLISHING THE BUSINESS AND NOT THEREAFTER RECOUPED FROM REVENUE SHOULD ENTER AS AN ELEMENT INTO THE BASE UPON WHICH A FAIR RETURN SHOULD BE ALLOWED NOT TO INCLUDE SUCH PART OF THE OUTLAY OR INVESTMENT AS IS NECESSARILY AND JUDICIOUSLY MADE AT THE START IN CANVASSING FOR AND ENLISTING CUSTOMERS OR AS IS NECESSARILY AND WISELY INCURRED BY REASON OF FOREGOING RETURNS DURING THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD WHEN MONEY IS LOCKED UP ACTS TO REPEL FUTURE ENTERPRISES FROM SIMILAR VENTURES THAT THE VALUE USED AS THE BASIS FOR TAXATION MUST BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS AN ELEMENT IN FIXING THE VALUATION FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IS WELL BROUGHT OUT IN THE CASE OF THE MARYLAND PUBLIC SERV ICE COMMISSION BACHRACH ET AL VS CONSOLIDATED GAS ELECTRIC LIGHT AND POWER COMPANY DECIDED JANUARY 13 1913 IN WHICH IT WAS HELD THAT THE VALUE OF 5000000 PLACED UPON THE EASEMENTS OF THE COMPANY IN THE STREETS OF BALTIMORE IS A PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE UTILITY UPON WHICH IT IS ENTITLED TO A REASONABLE RETURN THESE COMPARISONS SUMMARIZE THE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES APPEARING IN THE YEAR 1913 AND THE LATTER PART OF THE YEAR 1912 IN THE MORE IM PORTANT DECISIONS DISCUSSING RATEMAKING VALUE THE CONCLUSIONS WHICH SEEM PROPER FROM SUCH A COMPARATIVE REVIEW ARE AS FOLLOWS 1 WHEN APPRAISALS OF THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE PRESENT VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES EXPERIENCE 236TENDENCIES IN VALUATIONS FOR RATE MAKING HAS PROVEN THE NECESSITY OF MAKING MORE LIBERAL ADDITIONS FOR OVERHEAD PERCENTAGES NOT TO COVER MERE CONJECTURAL VALUES BUT TO INCLUDE COSTS WHICH DO NOT APPEAR IN THE APPRAISORS INVENTORY 2 WHEN THE PRESENT VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IS BASED UPON THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW DEDUCTION MAY PROPERLY BE MADE FOR THE DEPRECIATION IN VALUE THE AMOUNT OF SUCH DEDUCTION HOW EVER MAY VARY WITH THE CARE WITH WHICH THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY OR CORPORATION HAVE PROVIDED AGAINST SUCH DEPRECIATION AND THERE IS A TENDENCY TO MEASURE THE DEDUCTION BY INSPECTION RATHER THAN THEO RETICAL ESTIMATES OF EXPIRED LIFE WHERE THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY OR CORPORATION HAVE GIVEN EVIDENCE OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE DEPRECIATED PROPERTY SUCH FACT MAY BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION IN DETERMINING VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES LIKEWISE THE RESERVE ACCRUED BY THE OWNERS OF THE PROPERTY OR CORPORATION TO OFFSET DE PRECIATION IS PROPERLY CONSIDERED AN ASSET OF THE UTILITY FOR RATEMAK ING PURPOSES 3 WHERE THE COST OF REPRODUCTION NEW IS DETERMINED INCLUSION IS PROPERLY MADE FOR THE COST OF REPAVING OVER MAINS EVEN THOUGH IT HAS NOT BEEN NECESSARY FOR THE UTILITY TO DISTURB SUCH PAVING DURING THE COURSE OF CONSTRUCTION 4 WHERE THE PRESENT VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES IS DETER MINED INCLUSION MUST BE MADE FOR APPRECIATION AS WELL AS DEPRECIATION OF REAL ESTATE IT DOES NOT SEEM PROPER THAT ANY PORTION OF SUCH AP PRECIATION SHOULD BE CONSTRUED AS INCOME UPON WHICH DIVIDENDS OR TAXES MAY BE PAID WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS THE RECENT PROPOSAL TO DEDUCT THE SOCALLED UNEARNED INCREMENT FROM THE VALUE FOR RATE MAKING PURPOSES UPON THE THEORY OF A RELATION OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT IS DISSENTED FROM UPON THE GROUND THAT SUCH A POLICY WOULD CARRY WITH IT THE NECESSITY OF UNDERWRITING PAST LOSSES AS YET NO AT TEMPT HAS EVIDENTLY BEEN MADE TO APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE IN PRACTICE 5 THERE HAS BEEN A REITERATION AND ELABORATION OF THE NECESSITY OF INCLUDING GOING CONCERN VALUE IN THE PRESENT VALUE FOR RATEMAKING PURPOSES 237

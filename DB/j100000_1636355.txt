of the sun should be studied systematically every day at enough observ atories to escape terrestrial cloudiness direct radiation measures are still too en cumbered with meteorological conditions not fully eliminated as vapor contents and dust in the upper levels and transported heat in all levels to be of primary value at present the indirect measures of the solar radiation through the magnetic field whereby the amplitudes change with the variable solar energy promise the most simple and effective method of observation as soon as the subject of ionization can be more fully developed in the earths atmos phere the temperature pressure and wind effects at different localities must be studied by practical forecasters who fully under stand this complex train of causes and ef fects It may be stated in passing that no important improvements have been made in daily forecasting for 30 years and the same methods continue in vogue A change in the scale of verifications a more or less flexible margin of allowances for errors and successes present different percent age figures for comparison but on reduc tion to the same scale there has been no improvement for many years We pre pared tables for constructing daily pres sure charts on the sea level the 3500foot level and the 10000foot level and the mutual relations of the three respective systems of isobars are exceedingly instruc tive and suggestive The trend of the upper isobars shows the coming course of the storm tracks in a remarkable manner and the closed isobars of sea level are usually entirely drawn out on the 2mile level Similarly it is possible to prepare approximate isotherms on these two upper levels after suitable preliminary studies have been made and the close relations of these isobars and isotherm upper level charts to the areas of precipitation already studied in part will form the only possible basis for an improved method of forecast ing The Circulation of the Solar Mass The model of the circulation of the earths atmosphere is the proper analogue for the analysis of the circulation of the matter constituting the body of the sun if the ap parent difficulties in the way of securing the thermodynamic constants in the gen eral equations of motion can be overcome It is quite evident that the solar circula tion is an obverse picture of the terrestrial circulation If the maximum tempera tures in the earths atmosphere occur in middle latitudes on the sun the maximum temperatures are probably over the equa tor and over the poles with a minimum near the sun spot belts If in the earths atmosphere the westward drift is in the tropics in that of the sun it is in the polar regions if in the earths atmosphere the eastward drift is in the temperate zones in the suns atmosphere it is in the equatorial regions It will require much labor to work out the problem which is thus stated but conforming to the probable action of the general equations of motion It is my purpose to pursue these higher problems in solar physics so far as conditions per mit me to do so FRANK H BIGELOW WASHINGTON D C August 1910 A ZOOLOGICAL LABORATORY AT MONTEGO BAY JAMAICA B W I WHEN in 1891 Professor W K Brooks removed the zoological laboratory of the Johns Hopkins University to Port Hender son near Kingston Jamaica he deputed the present writer to visit all the other sites on the coast in search of the best 782 SCIENCEDECEMBER 2 1910 It was found that Montego Bay in the west ern part of the island was an exception ally promising place for a laboratory but as there was then no railroad connection to Montego Bay more accessible regions were preferred and following the lines of least resistance the laboratory was opened again at Port Henderson in 1893 and in 1896 while in 1897 it was removed to Port Antonio on the north coast After this most unfortunate season which brought with it the deaths from yellow fever of both Professor Humphrey and Dr Conant the university sent no more zoologists to Jamaica till the present year 1910 Montego Bay being now accessible both by steamer direct from New York from Philadelphia and from Baltimore and by rail from Kingston and Port Antonio six zoologists went to test the advantages of this region and in a residence lasting through June July August and Septem ber found it a most desirable location for all kinds of zoological work The advantages of this place are largely dependent upon its topography the con tour of the coast and the location of the hills form a large body of water cut off from the trade winds to a large extent but still widely open to the ocean on the north This calm water is exceptionally favorable for the capture of pelagic life A second advantage lies in the fact that all the rocks in the neighborhood are lime stone which forms white sands and clear water producing conditions much like those in the Bahamas Yet there are in teresting rivers with freshwater faunas close at hand but these discharge so that the wind and currents carry all the fresh water to the west and leave the region selected for a laboratory bathed at all times in purest salt water The remarkable uni formity of the sea is indicated in the fol

783  I 1 IN S VOL XXXII No 831 of fifteen degrees centigrade and corrected by a standard salinometer It shows that pure sea water of uniform temperature can be got at the laboratory at all hours Taken at the end of July and beginning of August of a reputedly hot summer it shows the lack of excessive heat by day and the comfortable coolness of early morning Moreover it expresses the small range of tide and the occurrence of a main high tide and a lesser tide each twentyfour hours one rising some sixteen and the other but four inches The climatic conditions proved favorable for work during June July and August we found the temperature in the labora tory not higher than 86 Fahrenheit by day and falling to 74 or 72 at night tempered by a strong sea breeze which be gan from seven to nine in the morning and died away before sunset and by a gentle land breeze late in the night Afternoon showers laid the dust and kept the vegeta tion green upon the rocky hills The annual rainfall officially recorded for this locality is a golden mean between the extremes at Port Henderson and Port Antonio being 55 to 70 inches while as little as 30 to 35 at the former and as much as 100 and more at the latter region This rainfall is so distributed that good crops of bananas cocoanuts sugar cane and veg etables result Yet at the same time within a radius of only ten miles the rainfall map shows localities having all the possibilities of the island a small region with more than 100 a large region with 75 to 95 and small regions near us with 40 to 50 and even 30 to 35 inches of rain annually The laboratory was within but a mile of the center of the city of Montego Bay be ing in fact within the city limits This proximity to a very interesting old colonial town of several thousand inhabitants with good shops fine market extensive trade and frequent connections with the United States as well as with all parts of Jamaica and with Colon proved a most decided ad vantage The building rented as a laboratory was a dwelling house known as Snug Har bor to the east of the town on the main road to Falmouth and close to the sea It is so well located for this purpose that it was selected as a favorable site back in 1891 and at present is the more desirable as being fitted by its present owner with screens to keep out mosquitoes and with the conveniences made possible by a city water supply However the chief factor in such a sta tion is the character of the accessible fauna and this was soon found to be on the whole better than in any other part of Jamaica yet tried though lacking some of the special advantages of the reefs of Port Antonio and the Cays off Kingston The strong feature of the fauna is its comprehensiveness its inclusion of so many diverse ecological areas within reachable limits A glance at the map would show that the laboratory while so exposed to the sea as to have Salpas Trichodesmium and the like pelagic forms of life brought to its very doors is yet close to coral reefs and stretches of clean white sand shore and bot tom The generally precipitous north side of Jamaica that drops in a third of a mile to the hundredfathom limit and then at once to the twothousandfathom ocean bottom offers in Montego Bay somewhat of an exception since there is here an area a mile wide and broad for dredging and fish ing within the hundredfathom limit While the general shore is clean rock or sand there is a fourth great source of ani mal life presented by the mangrove shores that lie at safe but convenient distances to the west and the east in addition to the 784 SCIENCEDECEMBER 2 1910 surface fauna the dredging and the col lecting on coral reefs Most especially favorable are the mangroves of the tortuous passages amidst the Bogue Islands some twenty minutes from the laboratory with the gasoline launch This interesting pro duct of the combined action of wind and current upon the material brought in past time to the sea by the Montego Bay River is now a growing addition to the large alluvial plain upon the edge of which the town of Montego Bay stands and as shown on the map consists of some larger and smaller islands near a dozen extending the alluvial deposits to the west under the influence of the trade winds The man grove trees covering these islands and the adjacent shores hang their roots into salt water along a total distance of many miles While some of this expanse of pendant roots is exposed to the fresh waters of the Bogue and Redding rivers and barren of animal life the major part of the edges of this whole complex of islands offers rich collecting ground comparable to that back of the Palisadoes near Kingston More over the quiet water between the islands where very deep is often the abode of swarms of jellyfish and zceas while the eel grass shoals have their own sponge lamel libranch worm and echinoderm forms Added to these four main marine col lecting fields are the fresh and brackish water and land faunas easily accessible Two rivers within a few miles of the lab oratory with interesting animal life were navigable for the launch for a mile or so above salt water The apparent former mouth of one now forms a brackish pond containing a rather unique commingling of both fresh and salt water animals Several small streams and springs were accessible while permanent ponds pre sented various stages between conditions in the interior and those close to the sea On the land the fauna accessible is that of a rather dry rocky coastal ridge of hills of mangrove swamps of a rich alluvial plain and of the mountainous interior to be reached by train or wagon Not to be overlooked are the large caverns with their dense population of bats Referring to the fauna more in detail it may be noted that the surface collecting in the bay was better than at Port Antonio or Port Henderson Salpas medusae and especially siphonophores were abundant larval crustacea echinoderms ascidians and molluscs were taken in numbers the large tornaria larva was exceedingly com mon though as yet the adult has not been found there The water being very pure and free from inshore copepods the sur face material was readily studied The reefs are rich in the usual madre pores and porites with a great many hydro corals sea fans and other gorgonians with their attendant fishes molluscs worms and echinoderms But owing to the small tide and open nature of the coast the reefs are not as easily worked by wading as are some at Port Antonio though by patient wait ing till the single low tide of the twenty four hours comes at a convenient time of day very good collecting can be had at the reefs near the laboratory or to the west or to the east On the reefs and in the harbor where scattered corals abound many species were taken by a modified pair of oyster tongs and by diving in which the native fisher men often excel Some large and interest ing sponges were thus obtained as well as a few small ones of commercial significance Owing to the great clearness of the water the common water glass or bucket with glass bottom brought the fauna well within observing reach at considerable depths so that little use was made of the Japanese diving spectacles that enable the SCIENCE 785N S VoL XXXII No 831 observer to see the bottom fauna very dis tinctly as long as he can hold his head under water In some cases these too little known tools were of value and interest though the extreme prevalence of the spiny sea urchin Diadema makes one cautious in the use of ones head under water The presence of stinging corals seascorpions and sea stings also inculcates caution in the handling of dimly seen objects On the reef close to the laboratory was found crawling one night the remarkably branched echinoderm Gorgonocephalus or Astrophyton rarely seen except in deeper water dredgings The nearby beach a perfect bathing beach yielded hippas and interesting gasteropods including the carrier shell Xenophora conchiliophora as well as echinoderms The rocks at the laboratory were covered with chitons echini gastero pods and the active crab Grapsus grapsus L there known as Bessy lightfoot while at the boat wharf there single heads of coral with tubularian hydroids gave wit ness to the pureness of the water in which brightcolored fish and changing squids made daily journeys and reappearances The means at hand for dredging proved inadequate to the deeper parts of the bay but showed considerable workable areas near shore free from coral heads and in habited by gasteropods ascidians and star fish The location of the laboratory proved unexpectedly advantageous for the study of tropical fishes and their parasites since almost all the fish caught for the town daily passed under our eyes The fifty or so dugout canoes that are seen resting on the sands by their owners houses in the town all day long are out about the reefs before dawn when the fishermen haul their traps or fish with hook and line till the rise of the trade wind sends them home directly past the laboratory Being men of keen ob servation and knowledge of the natural history of the reefs and in need of money as well it was a mutual advantage to have them stop to exhibit both the usual catch and any unusual animal that might else have been thrown back into the sea Much of the fishing being carried on with traps or pots baited with sprats or mashed Diademas not only fish of all kinds but many crustacea and molluscs are taken and from depths not otherwise easy of ac cess As emphasizing the beautiful clearness of the water it may be noted that the fish ermen throw their traps into water many fathoms deep with no buoy to mark them in confidence that from their knowledge of the landscape of the bottom they can find the spot for each of their many traps and then see it well enough to take it up with a hook and line The ecological territory consisting of mangrove roots hanging in quiet sea water along the edges of the Bogue Islands is in habited by vast masses of vegetable and animal life representing all the phyla of the animal kingdom if but few groups of plants Before the hanging roots have grown down to the bottom they furnish favorable place of attachment for free swiming larvae and are soon covered over with fixed growths of oysters barnacles sponges hydroids algae and many sorts of simple and compound ascidians that grow into large complex masses near the surface of the water Amidst these fixed animals wander many strange crabs and active ophiurids and nudibranch and shelled gasteropods The exact makeup of these complex colonies varies from island to is land and from side to side while some passageways are rich in algae and in large tubicolous annelids The fauna of the Great and Montego 786 SCIENCEDECEMBEB 2 1910 Bay rivers besides some freshwater and marine fishes was noteworthy for the num bers of the variable snail Neritina and for the striking presence of the marine crabs accustomed to life in pure fresh water Sesarma miersii Rathbun and Glypto grapsus jamaicensis Benedict together with numerous prawns and shrimp Zweas swimming in fresh water a mile above the sea and reared to the adult form in fresh water were novelties here This adjustment of marine forms to the land is more conspicuous in the common white crab Cordesima guanhumi Latreille and the famous edible black crab Gecarcinus ruricola Lin and the hermit Coenobita diogenes all of which invaded the labora tory building at the period of their down ward march to the sea to wash spawn or let loose their longcarried young as zceas that sWim in the sea and ultimately come back to the long adult life on land in many cases far from the water Next in order of prominence about the building are the inevitable lizards with their interesting changes of colors or quick utilization of insect food or strange eve ning cries One iguana ten pounds in weight brought back alive seemed to be the last survivor on the Bogue Islands as the one kept at the Jamaica Institute Kings ton years since was thought to be the last in that part of the island Contrary to expectation some two or three species of snakes were found though till recently the island was reputed to have been cleared of serpents like Ireland but by the unsaintly mongoose This creature was as evident as our squirrel and though intractable as adult was we found easily tamed when captured young Neglecting the many interesting birds that abounded on all sides more attention was given to the common pedipalps scor pions centipedes and myriapods and some of the conspicuous insects including the large cucuyo and many smaller but brilliant luminous beetles As an example of the rarity of some animals it may be mentioned that one and only one specimen of Peripatus was found This species has hitherto been known only from two specimens found by Gosse in 1845 near Sav la Mar on the south coast and about eighty found near Bath in the extreme east of Jamaica by Swainson in 1892 and by Duerden and Grobham in 1901 Conspicuous throughout all this part of Jamaica are the large nests of termites and the smaller nests of stinging black ants on trees and fences and many near the labora tory afforded ample material for study A chief object of the expedition being to enable the candidates for the PhD degree to become personally acquainted with the fauna of these latitudes as part of their education much time was spent in general survey of the different ecological regions but some special problems were attacked Such were the locomotion of certain echin oderms the response of the pedicellarise to light the life history of the spiny lob ster Panularis argos and of several crabs notably Mithrax spinississimce Lamarck the origin of the remarkable phosphores cent areas seen on the sea bottom the bio logical value of the light emitted by several marine animals and by luminous beetles the anatomy and life histories of many parasitic copepods largely unknown species the daily rhythms of activity in termite communities the nature of the re sponses of termites of one colony to those of another the concurrence of small size and brilliance of coloring with life in brack ish water in the case of the freshwater Neritina virginea The six members of the laboratory en joyed good health during the entire summer SCIENCE 787N S VOL XXXII No 831 there and returned enthusiastic regarding the advantages of Montego Bay as com pared with Port Antonio Kingston and the Tortugas where one or another of them had previously worked Barring the necessary expense of the long sea voyage a temporary or a perma nent laboratory could be opened at Mon tego Bay with very small outlay and eco nomically maintained since labor and the necessities of life produced in the island are cheap and readily obtained While suitable buildings are few concrete block construction there has been demonstrated a success by the American consul so that a permanent laboratory might be rapidly constructed E A ANDREWS THE INTERNATIONAL 0ONGRESS OF RADI OLOGY AND ELECTRICITY BRUSSELS SEPTEMBER 1315 1910 UP to the present time two congresses of radiology have been held the first in Liege 1905 and the second at Brussels during the past autumn The second International Con gress of Radiology and Electricity opened on September 13 with a large attendance and it was somewhat surprising that subjects so relatively modern as those to which thb con gress was devoted should have attracted so many interested workers in these special fields The attendance during the congress approached closely to five hundred and much interest and enthusiasm was shown by those who took part in the many meetings Participants in the congress began arriving in Brussels as early as the tenth and at the first formal gathering a reception held at the Bourse on the evening of the twelfth the number present had already attained consid erable proportions Many notable scientists from all parts of the world were there in cluding Mme Curie Rutherford Soddy Arrhenius Rieke Exner St Meyer Rigi Hahn Du Bois Goldstein and others and in fact the congress was particularly conspicu ous in the relatively large number of promi nent workers in radiology and electricity that attended The work of the congress began on Tuesday September 13 with a meeting at the Palais des Fetes in the grounds of the exposi tion where Professor de Heen the president delivered an address and a number of details in connection with the organization were ar ranged In the afternoon of the same day a very in teresting meeting was held in the buildings of the university in which the problems of the nomenclature and standards were discussed The proceedings were begun by Professor Rutherford who stated that he had recently compared by the yray method the radium standards employed in the leading labora tories of several different countries and had observed very considerable differences amounting in some cases to 20 per cent be tween them He pointed out the importance of a uniform international standard by which the results and experiments of workers in all parts of the world might be brought into ac cord As the subject of radioactivity had reached a stage of development where accu rate quantitative measurements and compari sons are being constantly made and as cer tain radioactive quantities such as the number of a particles emitted by one gram of radium the volume of the emanation pro duced and the heating effect can now be de termined with considerable precision it is highly desirable that the necessary informa tion as to the exact amount of radium in any given specimen of the substance should be definitely and readily determinable by differ ent workers It was therefore suggested that a specimen of the purest obtainable salt of radium should be prepared and accepted as an international standard and that facilities be afforded by which all workers in the science might be able to express their results in terms of that standard The subject was generally discussed and it was finally decided that a committee to be appointed by Professor Rutherford and Mme Curie should be formed and that this committee should consider the special needs in the matter and determine the conditions under which the standard should

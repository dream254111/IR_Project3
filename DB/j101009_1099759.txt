FED 967 AND QUOTING THE PRESENT MR JUSTICE BROWN THEN DISTRICT JUDGE IN RE WEBER FURNITURE CO FED CAS NOS 17330 AND 17 331  BUT WHERE A COMPOSITION DEED HAS BEEN SIGNED BY A LARGE MAJORITY OF THE CREDITORS UPON A FULL CONSIDERATION OF THE CONDITION OF THE DEBTOR I SHOULD BE VERY RELUCTANT TO OVERRULE THEIR JUDGMENT SIMPLY BECAUSE I THOUGHT THE ESTATE WOULD YIELD A LARGER DIVIDEND IN BANKRUPTCY MUCH WOULD DEPEND UPON THE CHARACTER OF THE PROPERTY AND THE STATE OF THE MARKETS IN THE CASE ABOVE CITED JUDGE LOWELL INTIMATED THAT A DIFFERENCE OF FIVE PER CENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF THE DEBTS AND THE PROBABLE AMOUNT OF THE ASSETS WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO INDUCE ME TO REJECT THE RESOLUTION I WOULD GO EVEN FURTHER THAN THAT AND SAY THAT WHERE THE PROPERTY CONSISTED OF REAL ESTATE OR OF GOODS THE VALUE OF WHICH DEPENDED UPON THE CAPRICES OF FASHION OR OTHER LIKE CONTINGENCIES I WOULD NOT OVERRULE THE DISCRETION OF THE CREDITORS FAIRLY EXERCISED IF THE DIFFERENCE WERE TEN OR EVEN FIFTEEN PER CENT

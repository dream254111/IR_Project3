laws of the United States are binding on all the1902 NOTES OF CASES 71 courts and it cannot be assumed that the State court will refuse to administer them Per Shelby Circ J  The bankrupt act was unquestionably designed by the Congress to secure the possession of the property of the bankrupt for administration under the pro ceedings in bankruptcy The district court has authority under paragraph 3 of section 2 to appoint receivers or the marshals upon application of parties in interest in case the court shall find it absolutely necessary for the preserva tion of estates to take charge of the property of bankrupts after the filing of the petition and until it is dismissed or the trustee appointed Other provis ions are in the act for the recovery of the bankrupts property by the trustee when appointed By authority so conferred the district court in a proper case may direct the marshal under summary process to seize the property of the bankrupt in the hands of third persons claiming to own it Sharpe v Doyle 102 U S 686 26 L Ed 277 Feibelman v Packard 109 U S 421 3 Sup Ct 289 27 L Ed 984 may compel the return of property of the bankrupt illegally taken out of the

Fed 323 7 Va Law Register 809 sub nom In Re Macon Sash c Co in which Judge Speer adjudged to the bankruptcy act absolute exclusiveness in its scope and operation ruling not only that all proceedings under State insolvency laws after the enactment of the Federal act are ipso facto nuil and void but that the appoint ment of a receiver by a State court to administer the assets is a nullity and that such receiver refusing to surrender the assets for the safekeeping of which he had given bond is liable to punishment for contempt of the Federal court and cannot be discharged even on habeas corpus until he surrenders that to which he is adjudged to have no claim Failure to Account for Assets The facts showed that the bankrupt a few months before his adjudication as such occupied the fifth story of a building reached by elevator and electric railway in which he admitted that he had on a certain day 10000 worth of stock He further alleged that on the next day his store was entered and the greater portion of his merchandise stolen but because of certain conflicting statements made by him to the police the referee reported that the conclusion was irresistible that the alleged robbery never occurred and that the  stolen  stock or its avails was still in the possession or under the con trol of the bankrupt The bankrupt deserted the remainder of his stock and left it to any one who chose to take it The referee entertained an order com pelling him to pay the trustee the sum of 7000 the total liabilities being72 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER May some 6800 The court confirmed the order

shall confirm a composition if satisfied that 1 it is for the best interest of the creditors 2 the bankrupt has not been guilty of any cf the acts or failed to perform any of the duties which would be a bar to his discharge and 3 the offer and its acceptance are in good faith and have not been made or procured except as herein provided or by any means promises or acts herein forbidden Where 86 out of 89 unsecured cred itors representing an indebtedness of 11000 accepted and asked for the con firmation of a composition of twentyfive cents on the dollar and only one cred itor with a debt of 400 opposes it the assets being of the eharacter usually incident to a country mercantile business and the referee reporting that they might possibly yield 30 or 35 per cent the recommendation will be confirmed as being in the best interest of the creditors In re H J Arrington Co 113 Fed 498 Opinion by Waddill Dist J citing In re Morris 11 N B R 443 Bank v Doolittle 107 Fed 236 Adler v Jones 109 Fed 967 and quoting the present Mr Justice Brown then District Judge In Re Weber Furniture Co Fed Cas Nos 17330 and 17 331  But where a composition deed has been signed by a large majority of the creditors upon a full consideration of the condition of the debtor I should be very reluctant to overrule their judgment simply because I thought the estate would yield a larger dividend in bankruptcy Much would depend upon the character of the property and the state of the markets In the case above cited Judge Lowell intimated that a difference of five per cent upon the amount of the debts and the probable amount of the assets would not be sufficient to induce me to reject the resolution I would go even further than that and say that where the property consisted of real estate or of goods the value of which depended upon the caprices of fashion or other like contingencies I would not overrule the discretion of the creditors fairly exercised if the difference were ten or even fifteen per cent

arbitratorNotice to parties Opportunity to be heard Where two arbitrators who have power to appoint a third in case of their disagreement disagree and make the appointment it is necessary to inform the parties in interest of the appointment and give them a reasonable opportunity to produce evidence touching the matters in controversy In the absence of an agreement to that effect it is not sufficient for the third arbitrator to derive his knowledge of the evidence from the other arbitrators The case should be reheard by him 2 CHANCERY JURISDICTIONParties before courtLegal defencesComplete relief Every party in interest being before the court on a bill to set aside an award on grounds which unquestionably give the court jurisdiction and the award having been set aside the court may decide the whole controversy and render a final decree though all the issues are legal in their nature capable of being tried by a court of law and the legal remedies therefor adequate

differences to  Alwyn Jameson and C J Rixey to arbitrate matters in controversy between us as stated below with power to mutually agree on a third arbitrator to decide any difference that they may not be able to agree upon The matters in contro versy to be decided are all accounts and property in which we are jointly interested We agree and bind ourselves to abide by the decision of said arbitra tors Witness our hands and seals this 27th day of May 1892 J W COONS Seal H C CooNs Seal The parties appeared before the board of arbitrators in person and each introduced witnesses and the arbitrators failing to agree they in accordance with the terms of submission selected G B W Nalle who made an award in which Jameson united by which it was ascer tained that J W Coons should pay to H C Coons 448270 one third in cash and the balance in two years with six per cent interest to be secured to the satisfaction of H C Coons to be in full settle ment of all claims on the part of H C Coons against J W Coons When the award was first promulgated J W Coons while expressing great dissatisfaction with it appears to have intended to abide by and execute it and with that end in view had the necessary papers pre pared which when submitted to H C Coons did not meet the approbation of himself or of his counsel The delay consequent upon his objection resulted finally in an investigation on the part of J W Coons as to the mode of procedure upon the part of the arbitrators and as a result of that investigation he determined to resist the award Some time thereafter H C Coons instituted an action of covenant upon the award and thereupon J W Coons filed his bill in the Cir cuit Court of Culpeper county in which he makes H C Coons a defendant and attacks the award of the arbitrators First because it fails to pass upon certain matters included in the submission Second because it does pass upon matters not included in the sub mission Third because upon its face the award is erroneous in violating the provisions of the statute of limitations Fourth because of misconduct upon the part of one of the arbitra tors and Fifth because the umpire or third arbitrator  without giving any notice to your orator and without his knowledge or consent and 1898 717 COONS V COONSVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER without hearing any evidence made up his award solely and exclu sively upon the statements of the two arbitrators made in the absence and without the knowledge of your orator and thus your orators cause was adjudged and decided without a hearing contrary to all law human and Divine The bill prays that H C Coons may be enjoined from the further prosecution of the action at law brought by him and an injunction was awarded The answer of the defendant denies all the equities set up in the bill and gives a statement of the transactions out of which the original controversy grew and concludes with the prayer that it may be treated as a crossbill and relief afforded him in the event the court should be of opinion that the award was for any cause invalid The answer treated as a crossbill was itself answered by the plaintiff JW Coons and upon the issues thus made much testimony was taken and the cause coming on finally to be heard before the Circuit Court the bill of the plaintiff was dismissed and thereupon he applied for and obtained an appeal from one of the judges of this court In the view we have taken of this case it will be only necessary to consider the effect upon the award of the failure of the arbitrators to give notice of the appointment of the third arbitrator and to have the case reheard if either of the parties desired to do so The evidence upon this point is that upon the disagreement of Jame son and Rixey they in the first place selected B W Stringfellow who was objected to by J W Coons on account of some supposed connec tion between him and the wife of H C Coons thereupon the arbitra tors agreed upon G B W Nalle who consented to serve J W Coons denies that he was ever notified of Nalles appointment and there is no proof of the fact It does appear that about one oclock on the day that the award was made J W Coons was in the town of Culpeper and that he was then informed that the arbitrators were in session and about four oclock of the same day their award was an nounced Taking the facts proved and deducing from them all the inferences with which J W Coons could with propriety be affected the case stands thus He knew that he had submitted this controversy to the arbitrament of Jameson and Rixey He knew that they had been unable to agree and that in pursuance of the authority vested in them by the terms of the submission they had appointed a third arbitrator to whom he had objected and on learning that the board 718 Febwas in session on the day that the award was made he may be pre sumed to have known that choice of a third arbitrator had been made But assuming all this to be so and nothing more than this can be imputed to him was he not then justified in assuming that the board would proceed in accordance with the law and notify him of their readiness to hear any testimony he might desire to adduce This brings us to the consideration of the question as to what is the duty of arbitrators under such circumstances for that he had a right to assume that they would perform their duty in accordance with the law in a regular and orderly manner cannot be denied Boards of arbitration which are courts of the parties own selection are favored by the law and every fair presumption is made in order to sustain their award This we believe is the universal rule applied to the interpretation of the agreement to submit and to all the pro ceedings which lead up to and result in the award In Pollocks Admr v Sutherlin 25 Gratt 78 Judge Moncure says All fair presumptions shall be made in favor of an award and if on any fair presumption the award may be brought within the sub mission it shall be sustained But there are certain immutable principles with reference to the administration of justice which cannot be disregarded in any tribunal which undertakes to pass upon the rights of others  It is a cardinal principle in the administration of justice that no man can be con demned or divested of his rights until he has had the opportunity of being heard and if judgment is rendered against him before that is done the proceedings will be as utterly void as if the court had under taken to act where the subject matter was not within its cognizance Bloom v Burdick 1 Hill N Y 130  Jurisdiction of the cause and parties is essential to the conclusive ness of a judgment or decree To acquire jurisdiction of the defend ant it is necessary that in some appropriate way he be notified of the pendency of the suit If upon the inspection of the record it appears that no such notice has been given the judgment or decree is void Wilcher et als v Robertson 78 Va 616 Notice and an opportunity to be heard are essential requisites to the jurisdiction of all courts and judgment without jurisdiction is a nullity Dorrs Admr v Rohr  als 82 Va at page 363 Staun ton Perpetual B  L Co v Haden and authorities cited 92 Va 201 And while there seem to be adjudged cases in which this rule has 719 1898 COON8 V COONBVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER been somewhat relaxed as to arbitrations they do not meet with our approval The injustice is the same and the injury as great to deprive one of a right without a hearing before arbitrators as before a court In Day v Hammond 57 N Y 479 it is held that parties are always entitled to a hearing before arbitrators unless that hearing is waived and that if an umpire or other arbitrator is called in in case of disagreement the same rule as to a right of rehearing applies The waiver of this right must be distinct and unequivocal And in Elmendorf v Harris 23 Wend 628 If an umpire decides without having appointed a time for hearing and without giving notice of it to a losing party the award is a nullity in a court of law The case of Hall v Lawrence 4 Term 589 has led to much con troversy It seems to hold that the parties need not be notified or be given an opportunity for the introduction of evidence or have their case reheard before a third arbitrator It is generally considered that the case turned upon the doctrine of waiver and upon that suggestion only can it be supported In Day v Hammond supra it is said Hall v Lawrence has sometimes been misunderstood as deciding a general rule in the law of arbitrations Its effect should be limited to the proposition that parties may waive their clear and indisputable right to a rehearing of the cause To that extent it is sound law In Salkeld v Slater 12 Ad  El 767 Chief Justice Dennian says It is important to have it understood that the umpire as well as the arbitrators ought to hear and see the witnesses The objection to a different course may be waived but more complete proof of waiver should be given than in the present case  See also Goldsmith v Tilly Har  John 361 Thomas v West Jersey R R Co 9 Green 567 Shivey v Knoblock 8 Moon 433 Lutz v Linthican 8 Peters 165 Russell on the Power and Duty of Arbitrators p 228 says The umpire and the duty of an umpire is universally regarded as identi cal with that of the third arbitrator when called upon to act is in general invested with the same powers as the arbitrators and bound by the same rules and has to perform the same duties He must pursue the same regular course with respect to the conduct of the case as if he were commencing a new case as arbitrator He must examine such witnesses as the parties choose to produce and as to such points as they choose to raise although the same witnesses have been examined to the same points before the arbitrators He may not take the evi dence or any part of it fromll the notes of the arbitrators unless there 720 Feb1898 COONS V COONS 721 be a special provision in the submission or a clear agreement between the parties permitting such a course We deduce from the authorities the general rule that where two arbitrators who differ have the power to appoint a third who shall have authority to decide between them it is necessary to inform the parties in interest of his appointment and give them a reasonable opportu nity to produce evidence before them touching the matters in contro versy J W Coons was never informed of the appointment of the third arbitrator As far as the record shows it came to his knowledge cas ually while in the town of Culpeper He seems to have known that the board was in session but as he only arrived in the town at one oclock p m and the award was announced at four oclock on the evening of that day we think the facts are insufficient to charge him with having waived his right to appear or having acquiesced in the denial of an opportunity to introduce witnesses in his behalf It is unnecessary to cite authorities upon this point the cases already alluded to as to the duty of the arbitrators to rehear afford abundant support for the proposition that while the right under consideration may be waived evidence of the waiver must be clear and conclusive It is contended on behalf of the appellees that there has been a ratification of the award by which any errors or imperfections in the proceedings which led up to it have been cured In the statement of facts at the beginning of this opinion we have summarized the evidence upon this point Only a short time elapsed between the rendition of the award and the determination upon the part of J W Coons to attack it by bill in equity He was disposed in the first place to abide by it and papers were prepared and steps taken looking to its execution but nothing was consummated and nothing was done which in any degree compromised or affected the right of H C Coons There is nothing in the situation which invites a court to apply the doctrine of estoppel to the conduct of J W Coons and what was done falls far short of an express ratification We are of opinion that for the failure upon the part of the arbi trators to notify the appellant of the appointment of the third arbitra tor and of their readiness to proceed with the case thus affording him the opportunity to introduce evidence in support of his contention the award should be vacated and annulled Having reached this conclusion it is unnecessary to discuss the other grounds of attack stated in the billVIRGINIA LAW REGISTER We will now consider the prayer of the crossbill for relief Every party in interest is before the court upon a bill to set aside an award upon grounds which unquestionably give a court of equity jurisdiction This jurisdiction having once attached for the purpose of injunction the court may decide the whole controversy and render a final decree though all the issues are legal in their nature capable of being tried by a court of law and the legal remedies therefor adequate Jesus College v Bloom 3 Atkyns

We are therefore of opinion that the decree of the Circuit Court of Culpeper county should be reversed and the cause remanded with instruction to refer it to a commissioner in chancery to ascertain in what property real and personal J W and H C Coons were jointly interested on the 27th day of May 1892 and to state and settle all joint accounts existing between them at that date the commissioner to

whatever of its being of marine origin and its northward extension well into the heart of central Brazil makes it embrace a very considerable portion of the Archamazonia faunal region of Dr von Ihering The heavy trap dykes and sheets of this for mation give very marked topographical fea tures lines of escarpments and obstructions in rivers by which it can be traced even in re gions that have not been geologically examined and for some years I have occupied myself in tracing its distribution through such chance in formation and specimens as were obtainable from regions not personally known to me Particularly valuable for this purpose was the material which for years has been accumulating in the Museum National of Rio de Janeiro and which for the region under discussion is especi ally important and authentic since it contains a complete duplication of the material collected by Sellow on which Weiss paper the most im portant that has yet appeared on the geology of Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay was based Without going into detail suffice it to say that there is evidence that I consider sufficient to establish the general fact that this formation extends without a break and in the form of a great tableland from 600 to 1000 meters high from near the headwaters of the Parana in southern Goyaz and western Minas Gerses to the line of escarped hills that cross nearly in the middle the State of Rio Grande do Sul from east to west To the south of this line which seems to be a giant fault the formation lies lower and has been much denuded so that it is frequently interrupted by areas of older rocks appearing from underneath but thus far no evidence whatever has been presented of the occurrence of any overlying formation of marine origin Of special significance for our present purpose is the fact that the falls and rapids of the river Uruguay down to the Brazilian limit and be yond are composed of the hard traps of this for mation which would thus present a barrier to the sea which in tertiary times undoubtedly oc cupied a part of the Argentine province of 349 Entre Rios The only point where the deposits of this sea are known to extend to the eastern bank of the Uruguay is near the town of Col onia too far south to suit the hypothesis here discussed Topographically considered the only line in which there was a possibility of a break across this barrier is a depressed area in front of the above mentioned line of escarp ments occupied by parts of the valleys of the rivers Ybicuhy flowing westward to the Uruguay and Jacuhy flowing eastward to the Atlantic These two valleys are however separated by a considerable spur that unites like an isthmus the highlands of the upper Uruguay basin with those of southern Rio Grande do Sul and Uruguay Thus far no evidence has been presented that this isthmus was ever submerged or that the depressed portions of the Ybicuhy and Jacuhy valleys are occupied by other than fluvial deposits It is quite possible that in secondary or tertiary times an arm of the sea may have extended into the region of the lower part of the present Jacuhy valley but if so there is slight proba bility that it extended westward into those of the Ybicuhy and Uruguay and even if such a connection be admitted it could only have been a narrow strait quite incapable of produc ing the collosal faunal difference that it is attempted to explain Speculation as to the probable existence of this strait is moreover quite gratuitous since if I rightly understand Dr von Ihering its position is entirely within his Archiplata subregion

CHEMISTRY ROCK FORMATION AN important contribution to the study of solid solutions has been made by Professor W Spring in the Revue Generale des Sciences under the title of The Plasticity of Solid Bodies and MARCH 1 1901N S VOL XIII No 322 its Connection with RockFormation Experi ments were carried out to determine whether under the influence of great pressure solid par ticles which do not under ordinary circumstances unite might be made to cohere The pressure used in the experiments was about 10000 at mospheres and this pressure could be exerted if necessary at a temperature as high as 400 All bodies which are plastic under pressure were found to cohere as if they had been fused while those substances which are not malleable remained in a powder after exposure to the greatest pressures Thus sand calcium car bonate alumina and oxid of iron did not cohere and since the pressure used corresponds to a column of sand fifty kilometers in height pressure alone can not be the cause of the for mation of rocks from these materials Metallic powders on the other hand cohere perfectly which must be due to a kind of solid solution That this is probable is shown by using mix tures of different metals in which case alloys are formed as perfectly as by fusion Those metals however which do not alloy by fusion as lead and zinc will not alloy under pressure That these alloys were not occasioned by a mere mixing under pressure was shown by placing together without pressure cylinders of the same and of different metals Even in the cold there was some adherence and when heated to a temperature far below the point of fusion a perfect union was obtained in a few hours In the case of the union of different metals an alloy was formed at the line of junc tion which with tin and lead was six millimeters in thickness Compounds were readily formed by pressure in those instances where the vol ume of the compound is less than that of its constituent elements as with silver and sul phur on the other hand compounds which oc cupy more space than their constituents were dissociated by pressure Thus copper calcium acetate was decomposed into copper acetate calcium acetate and water In those cases where solution is accompanied by contraction the presence of water was found to greatly as sist in the formation of solid masses from the powders and solid carbonates were readily formed A solution of silicic acid alone did not cause agglutination of sand owing to the great contraction on drying but when combined with even low pressure solidification to a consider able extent was obtained All these influences have played a part in rock formation ARSENIC IN COPPER LITTLE is given in chemical literature regard ing the effect of small quantities of arsenic upon copper a subject of much importance at the present day A series of experiments is de scribed by Ernest A Lewis in the Chemical News in which arsenic was added to a copper 99843 per cent pure and the resultant metal studied photomicrographically and as to its physical properties Malleability is not appre ciably affected by small quantities of arsenic up to 18 per cent the samples with 1 per cent and with 137 per cent rolling particularly well The tensile strefigth is from 3 to 5 tons higher than that of ordinary sheet copper the limit of elasticity is about 3 tons per square inch higher and the elongation is not reduced From micro graphical examination the metal appears to consist of crystals of copper in a eutectic of copper arsenid or a solution of copper arsenid in copper In copper intended for rolling ex cept that for electrical purposes the presence of a small amount of arsenic appears to be a dis tinct advantage but nothing is gained by hav ing more than 05 per cent present ATMOSPHERIC HYDROGEN AN interesting result of Professor Dewars latest experiments in conjunction with Profes sor Liveing on the more volatile of the inert gases of the atmosphere is the demonstration that hydrogen exists free in the atmosphere in sensible proportion There has been much question in the past as to its presence which has not been heretofore satisfactorily proved indeed the velocity of the hydrogen molecule renders it doubtful as to whether hydrogen would not escape from the earth into inter planetary space On this basis there must be a continual accession of hydrogen to this planet from the interplanetary space and hence possi bly of the elements which occasion the lines of the nebular and coronal spectra Some indica tions in this direction have been found in the atmospheric inert gases and these are now being studied from this standpoint J L H 350 SCIENCE

America while it has settled some points has unsettled others A generation ago the terms Laurentian and Huron ian were thought to have a clear and definite application At that time we in Great Britain knew of only one Archaean group called Hebridean or Lewisian and supposed to be the equivalent in time of the Laurentian Later on British geologists discov ered a second preCambrian formation the Pebidian of Dr Hicks or Uriconian of the writer This great volcanic sys tem bore many resemblances to the published descriptions of the Huronian and it was referred with more or less hesitation to that group Meanwhile Dr Sterry Hunt was creating more systems in America We heard of his Norian Moutalbian Ta conian and Keweenian and every year we looked for new worlds from his prolific brain Unfortunately subsequent research in the United States and Canada has but very partially confirmed Dr Hunts results and even our faith in Laurentian and Huronian has been somewhat confused Huronian appears to be several things and Laurentian in some localities is said to be an intrusive granite Nevertheless it appears to be gen erally admitted that in North America there are gneisses and granites which are older than any other rockmasses and that in the same region there are volcanic formations which are younger than these crystallines and more ancient than the Cambrian so that the old notions on Laurentian and Huronian remain true in a general way It would also seem that North America contains sedimentary rocks which are newer than the Huronian and are yet preCambrian Thus it would hardly be rash to conclude that on the western side of the Atlantic there exist at least three Archaean rochgroups a gneissic a volcanic and a sedimentary and that they succeed each other in the order here given Now it is interesting to remark that this description agrees with the latest results of research in Great Britain We have first of all the gneisses and schists which in Scotland are called Hebridean and  Malvernian in England We cannot say that these formations are the exact equivalents of each other and it would certainly be rash to assert that they or either of them can be correlated with any rockmasses the other side of the Atlantic Nevertheless they are admitted to be the oldest rocks in Britain and in the opinion of the writer they are separated by a considerable interval from the formation which comes next This great volcanic system holds the place originally assigned to it in the Archaean series by Dr Hicks and the writer Its pre Cambrian age has been admitted by Sir A Geikie directorgen eral of the Geological Survey of Great Britain and Ireland so far NCE VOL XXI No 518 as the Uriconian rocks of Shropshire are concerned but he assigns the Pebidian of St Davids to the base of the Cambrian In the opinion of the writer the volcanic rocks of St Davids are truly preCambrian so that the name Pebidian originally given to them by Dr Hicks has priority over the more modern term Uriconian These rocks are of wide distribution being found in North and South Wales at Charnwood near Leicester in many parts of Shropshire in the Malvern Hills and probably at Howth near Dublin Evidence has recently been collected of a third preCambrian system Near Church Stretton in Shropshire is a chain of hills forming Longmynd built up of conglom erates sandstones and slates Murchison called these sediments  Bottom Rocks and he referred them to the Lower Cambrian This view has been adopted by the English Geological Survey and generally accepted Recently however evidence has been collected which makes it almost certain that this formation is of preCambrian age and the present writer has given it the name Longmyndian The true basal Cambrian a band of quartzite occurs in close proximity to the Longmynd rocks though not in absolute contact and it is incredible that the Longmyndian which is some miles in vertical thickness should be a mere sub division of the Cambrian which is found in three of its four mem bers within a few miles to the east It would seem then that on both sides of the Atlantic the Archaean or preCambrian series consists of at least three members gneissic volcanic and sedimentary which follow each other in the same order suggest ing a similarity of conditions in both areas in the successive epochs of Archaean time LETTERS TO THE EDITOR

of the Science Professor Cyrus Thomas devotes a few more pages to the problem of the Maya hieroglyphic writing  These he says  may perhaps be profitable to the subject if confined to an earnest endeavor to arrive at the truth The additional evidence introduced in this manner by Professor Cyrus Thomas he has seen fit to precede by some remarks intended to invalidate the criticism I offered in this paper some months ago Science Aug 26 My answer to these remarks is presented in the following lines which I trust will also be profita ble to the subject although I do not claim to be the only scientific man that  earnestly endeavors to arrive at the truth Professor Thomas is correct in stating that  a dot and two crosses with a monthsymbol form a date in the bottom line of Plate 49 Dresden Codex Nevertheless I firmly believe I can main tain that  there does not exist a numeral designation with crosses between the dots I have never seen it in the Codices On the other hand I found for instance on the sides of the Stela J of Copan Maadsley  Biologia Centrali Americani Pl 6970 that the one dot of the numerals 1 6 11 and 16 always is framed by two ornamental signs but there is never an ornamental sign be tween the two dots of the numbers 2 7 and 12 Compare the Figs 116 of the adjoined table Moreover I think the analogy between the two hieroglyphs Figs 29 and 30 of my former paper is obvious Since in the one case the two dots and the cross are a part of the hieroglyph and not a numeral I hope it will not be a fault of veracity to believe the same in the other Professor Thomas says I am not correct in stating that Fig 30 of my former paper is the glyph he interpreted moisture True the parts are similar he says  but the details and sur roundings are different In the adjoined table I reproduce the Fig 30 of my former paper by Fig 17 and Professor Thomass moisture symbol by the Fig 18 Certainly the surroundings are different In Fig 17 the hieroglyph is placed on a dish in Fig 18 on the hand And there are wanting in Fig 18 the two dots and the cross that are seen in Fig 17 But the parts are not   I

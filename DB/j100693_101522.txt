PUBLISHD THE LAST YEAR WOULD SOONER HAVE BEEN TAKEN NO TICE OFF IN THESE TRACTS HAD IT NOT ESCAPED THE PUBLISHERS VIEW TILL OF LATE WHEN HE UPON SERIOUS PERUSAL FOUND IT VERY WORTHY THE RECOMMENDING IT TO ALL SORTS OF PERSONS AND PARTICULARLY TO THOSE WHO EITHER PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH THAT FOND OPINION THAT PHILOSOPHY IS THE APPRENTISHIP OF ATHEISME OR HEARKEN TO THE ASPERSIONS THAT ARE GENERALLY LAID UPON THE REFORMATION OF PHILOSOPHY THIS EXCELLENT PIECE REMOVES BOTH THESE AND BEING JOYNED AND COMPARED WITH THE TRULY NOBLE MR BOYLES CONSIDERATIONS IN HIS FIRST PART OF THE USEFUL325 USEFULNESS OF EXPERIMENTALNATURAL PHILOSOPHY WILL STRONGLY EVINCE HOW MUCH THAT PHILOSOPHY WHICH SEARCHES OUT THE REAL PRODUCTIONS OF NATURE THE TRUE WORKS OF GOD DOES MANIFEST THE DIVINE GLORY MORE THAN THE NOTIONALS OF THE GENTILS THIS AUTHOR NOW A FELLOW OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY DELIVERS HIS MATTER IN TWO BOOKS LIB 1 CAP 1 ATHEISTS ARE DISAPPOINTED OF THE AUTHORITY OF EPICURUS AND OF OTHER ANTIENT PHILOSOPHERS FOR THEIR GROSS ATHEISME CAP 2 THE BEAUTIFULL FRAME OF THE WORLD EVINCETH THE ARCHITECTONICAL AUTHOR AND GOVERNOR CAP 3 THE ADMIRABLE CONTRIVANCE IN THE STRUCTURE OF MANKIND AND OF ANIMALS DOES MORE CONSPICUOUSLY SHEW THE DEITY CAP 4 THE ATHEIST CAUGHT IN HIS ONE NET OR CONVINCED BY THE TRUE FORCE OF HIS OWN ARGUMENTS CAP 5 THE ARGUMENTS DEVISED AGAINST ATHEISTS BY DES CARTES AND DRAWN FROM THE IDEAS OF OUR MIND EXAMIND AND FOUND IMPERFECT AND INVALID LIB 2 CAP I THE OPINIONS OF THE GENTILS CONCERNING GOD UNDULY APPLYED TO THE DEITY WHICH WE WORSHIP BUT PROPERLY TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY THEM OF THE SUN OR OF THE SOUL OF THE WORLD CAP 2 MORE EXPRESLY PROVED THAT THE ANTIENT PHILOSOPHERS CONCEIVED THE SOUL OF THE WORLD TO BE GOD CAP 3 THE HISTORICAL THEOLOGY OF THE GENTILS FOR THE MOST PART IS UN DULY APPLYED OR ACCOMMODATED TO THE HOLY SCRIPTURES CAP 4 THE DIVINE SUBSTANCE IMMENSITY INCOMPREHENSIBILITY INVISI BILITY EXPLICATED AS FAR AS OUR WEAK REASON DOES REACH CAP 5 THE DIVINE PERFECTIONS AND OTHER ATTRIBUTES AND AFFECTIONS HOW FAR EXPLICABLE CAP 6 THE ETERNITY OF GOD HOW APPREHENDED THESE ARE IN SHORT THE HEADS OF THE BOOK WHICH IS YET BUT IN LATIN IT WERE TO BE WISHT THE AUTHOUR WOULD MAKE IT SPEAK HIS OWN LIVELY ENGLISH II HONORATI FABRI SOC JESU THEOLOGI TRACTATUS DUE QUORUM PRIOR EST DE PLANTIS CT DE GENERATIONE ANIMALIUM POSTERIOR DE HOMINE AS THE MATTER OF THIS BOOK IS CONSIDERABLE SO IS THE ORDER AND DEPEN DENCE OF ALL ITS PARTS EXCELLENT IN REGARD THAT ALL THE PROPOSITIONS ARE RANGED ACCORDING TO A GEOMETRICAL METHOD AND SO WELL DISPOSED THAT THE LATTER DO ALWAYS SUPPOSE THE FORMER AND SEEM TO DEPEND ALL OF THEM UPON CERTAIN EVI DENT PRINCIPLES WHENCE THEY FLOW BY A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE THIS VOLUME CONTAINS TWO TREATISES THE FIRST IS DIVIDED INTO 5 BOOKS IN THE FOUR FIRST HE TREATS OF PLANTS AND DISTRIBUTES THEM INTO THREE CLASSES SOME GROWING IN THE EARTH AS TREES OTHERS GROWING UPON PLANTS AS MOSSE AND A THIRD SORT GROWING UPON ANIMALS AS HAIR HORNS AND FEATHERS HE EXAMINS AND CONSIDERS THE PARTS326 PARTS OF ALL THESE PLANTS AND THEIR USE THE MANNER HOW THEY ARE PRODUCED AND NOURISHED AND THEIR DIFFERENT QUALITIES HE DISCOURSES ALSO OF BREAD WINE OYLE AND THE OTHER MIXTES THAT ARE MADE OF PLANTES IN THE FIFTH BOOK HE TREATS OF THE GENERATION OF ANIMALS WHERE HE DELIVERS MANY CURIOUS MATTERS EXPLICATING IN A VERY EASIE AND FAMILIAR WAY THAT ARGUMENT WHICH HATH ALWAYES BEEN LOOKT UPON AS ONE OF THE OBSCUREST IN NATURAL PHILOSOPHY THE SECOND TREATISE CONSISTS OF 7 BOOKS WHEREIN THE AUTHORS CONSIDERS WHAT APPERTAINS TO MAN HE DISCOURSES FIRST OF DIGESTION OF THE CIRCU LATION OF THE BLOUD AND OF THE USE OF THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF THE HUMAN BODY NEXT HE TREATS OF THE SENSESEXTERNAL AND INTERNAL OF ALL HE MOTIONS OF THE BODY BOTH NATURAL AND VOLUNTARY OF THE SENSITIVE APPETITE AND THE PAS SIONS THENCE HE PROCEEDS TO THE TEMPERAMENTS HABITS INSTINCT SLEEP SICKNESS C LASTLY PASSING TO THE RATIONAL SOUL HE ENDEAVOURS TO DE MONSTRATE THE IMMORTALITY THEREOF AND TO EXPLAIN ALSO THE MANNER HOW IT WORKETH UPON THE BODY AND IS UNITED WITH THE BODY WHERE HE OMITS NOT TO REASON OF ALL THE POWERS OF THE SOUL OF LIBERTY AND OF THE OPERATIONS OF THE UNDERSTANDING AND WILL IN GENERAL THE AUTHOUR MAKES IT HIS STUDY FOR THE EXPLICATING OF THE MOST PERPLEXT DIFFICULTIES TO SHEW THAT NATURE WORKS NOT BUT BY VERY SIMPLE AND EASIE WAYES IN PARTICULAR HE INTERSPERSES SEVERAL CURIOUS REMARKS E G HE TEACHES HOW TO MAKE PERSPECTIVES THAT MAGNIFIE OBJECTS WITHOUT GLASS TELLING US THAT WHEN AN OBJECT IS LOOKT UPON THROUGH A SMALL HOLE IT APPEARS MUCH GREATER THAN IT IS AND THAT THEREFORE IF INSTEAD OF GLASSES ONE DID CAST BEFORE ONES EYES TWO PLATES HAVING LITTLE HOLES IN THEM IT WOULD FURNISH US WITH A NEW KIND OF PERSPECTIVES MORE COMMODIOUS THAN THOSE OF GLASSES WHICH SPOIL THE SIGHT BY REASON OF THE REFRACTION OF THE RAYES CAUSED THEREBY AGAIN HE RENDERS THE CAUSE OF THAT COMMON BUT SURPRISING EFFECT OF PAINTERS DRAWING CERTAIN POURTRAICTURES WHICH SEEM TO LOOK DIRECTLY UPON ALL THEIR BEHOLDERS ON WHAT SIDE SOEVER THEY PLACE THEMSELVES VIDEL THAT IN THOSE PICTURES THE NOSE IS A LITTLE TURNED TO ONE SIDE AND THE EYES TO THE OTHER WHENCE IT COMES THAT SUCH PICTURES SEEN TO LOOK TO THE RIGHT SIDE BECAUSE THE EYES ARE INDEED TURNED THAT WAY BUT THEY APPEAR ALSO TO LOOK TO THE LEFT BECAUSE THE POINT OF THE NOSE IS TURNED THAT WAY AND THE TABLE WHEREON THE PICTURE IS DRAWN BEING FLAT THE LOOKER ON PERCEIVES NOT THAT THE EYES ARE TURNED THOTHER WAY WHICH HE WOULD DO IF THE EYES OF THE POURTRAIT WERE CONVEXE WHENCE IT COMES THAT NO FIGURE CAN BE MADE EMBOSSED WHICH LOOKS EVERY WAY THE ART WHICH HE TEACHES OF MAKING PARSLEY SHOOT OUT OF THE GROUND IN A FEW HOURS IS THIS INSUTE THE SEED OF IT IN VINEAGAR AND HAVING SOWN IT IN GOODGROUND CAST ON IT A GOOD QUANTITY OF THE ASHES OF BEANCODS AND SPRINKLE IT WITH SPIRIT OF WINE AND THEN COVER IT WITH SOME LINNEN HE MENTIONS ALSO THAT IF YOU CALCINE EARTH AND THEN WATER IT WELL IT WILL PRODUCE327 PRODUCE A GREAT VARIETY OF DIFFERENT HERBS AND THAT THE ASHES OF CORN BURNT BEING SOWN HAVE SOMETIMES PRODUCED OTHER CORN TO ADD THAT BY THE BY THIS AUTHOR IS NOT SO ADDICTED TO ARISTOTLE AS TO BE ON HIS SIDE WHEN HE THINKS TRUTH IS NOT HE HATH EMANCIPATED HIM SELF CONSIDERABLY FROM THE SCHOLASTICK WAY OF PHILOSOPHING HE DARES MAIN TAIN THAT THE VEGETATIVE AND SENSITIVE SOULS ARE NOT SUBSTANTIAL FORMS AND THAT IT IS WITH PLANTS AND ANIMALS AS WITH ARTIFICIAL THINGS THE FORM WHEREOF RESULTS FROM THE UNION AND DISPOSITION OF THE PARTS ACCORDING TO THIS HYPOTHESIS HE EXPLICATES ALL THE OPERATIONS OF PLANTS AND ANIMALS WITHOUT HAVING ANY RECOURSE TO THE SOUL HE AVERS ALSO THAT THERE ARE NO SPECIES INTENTIONALES AND NO HABITUDES AND THAT THE ANIMAL SPIRITS WHICH PHILOSOPHERS COMMONLY BELIEVE TO BE NECESSARY FOR ALL THE OPERATIONS OF LIFE ARE USELESS IT MIGHT ALSO BE OBSERVED OUT OF THIS AUTHOR WHAT HE DISCOURSES OF THE GENERATION OF ANIMALS BY PUTREFACTION OF THE CAUSE OF INTERMITTENT FEA VERS AND OF THE ANIMAL INSTINCT AND OF MANY OTHER PARTICULARS WERE IT NOT BETTER TO REFER THE CURIOUS

CHIEFLY ACCORDING TO HIS DESIGN TO GIVE AN ACCOMPT OF THE SUCCESS THE UNDERTAKERS OF THIS VOYAGE HAD IN PRO PAGATING THE CHRISTIAN FAITH IN THE REMOTER PARTS OF THE WORLD AND RELATING ON THAT OCCASION WHAT NUMBER OF CHURCHES THEY HAVE FOUNDED IN COCHIN CHINA AND THE KINGDOME OF TONQUIN IN WHICH LATTER ALONE HE AFFIRMS THAT THERE ARE MORE THEN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND CHRISTIANS BEING I SAY PRIN CIPALLY INTENT UPON THAT SUBJECT HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE MADE MANY PHILOSOPHICAL OBSERVATIONS IN THOSE PLACES MEAN WHILE HE DOES GOOD SERVICE TO THOSE THAT HAVE OCCASION TO TRAVEL INTO THE EASTINDIES MOSTLY BY LAND BY DESCRIBING THE PASSAGE THEY TOOK THITHER WHICH WAS THAT THEY EMBARQUED AT MAR SEILLES IN SEPTEMBER THE MOST CONVENIENT AND FAVORABLE SEASON FOR THAT VOYAGE WHENCE SHIPS DO ORDINARILY PASS EVERY MONTH FROM SYRIA RECKO NING ONE MONTH FOR THE TIME OF SAYLING TO ALEXANDRETTA THENCE TO ALEPPO COUNTING ONE MONTH MORE FOR THE STAY TO BE MADE THERE TO MEET THE CARA VANE FOR BABYLON AND SIX WEEKS MORE FOR THE MARCH FROM ALEPPO TO BABYLON WHERE A FORTNIGHT WILL PASS BEFORE AN OPPORTUNITY HAPPEN TO EMBARQUE UPON THE TYGER FOR BALSORA WHICH JOURNEY WILL REQUIRE A FORTNIGHT MORE AND ABOUT THIS TIME IT WILL BE NEER THE END OF JANUARY THENCE IS ALWAYS CON VENIENCY TO PASS TO CONGO 4 DAYS JOURNEY FROM COMORON OR GOMBROUN TO WHICH LATTER PART THERE IS ALSO FREQUENT OCCASION TO PASS BY SEA FROM BALSORA WHICH WILL TAKE UP SOME 15 OR 16 DAYS SAIL THERE VID AT COMORON YOU WILL EVERY YEAR MEET WITH ENGLISH PORTUGAL DUTCH AND MORISH VESSELS FOR SURATE FROM OCTOBER TILL THE END OF APRIL FOR THEY ARE OB LIGED TO BE AT SURATE BEFORE THE END OF MAY BECAUSE ALL THE PORTS OF THOSE X INDIES328 INDIES ARE SHUT THE 4 ENSUING MONTHS BY REASON OF THE DANGER OF THAT SEA BUT BESIDES THIS DIRECTIONTHE BOOK IS NOT QUITE DESTITUTE OF NATURAL OB SERVATIONS IT RELATES I HOW DIAMONDS ARE FOUND AND SEPARATED IN GOL CONDA THEY TAKE OF THE EARTH HELD TO BE PROPER TO FORM THEM WHICH IS REDDISH AND DISTINGUISHD WITH WHITE VEINS AND FULL OF FLINTS AND HARD LUMPS THEN THEY PUT NEAR THE PLACES WHICH THEY WILL DIGGE A CLOSE AND EVEN EARTH AND TO IT THEY CARRY THOSE EARTHS THEY HAVE DIGGED OUT OF THE MINE AND GENTLY SPREAD IT ABROAD AND LEAVE IT EXPOSED TO THE SUN FOR TWO DAYS THEN BEING DRYED ENOUGH THEY BEAT IT AND SIFTING THIS EARTH THEY FIND THE DIAMONDS IN ASHES OF FLINTS IN WHICH NATURE HATH SET THEM HERE HE ADDS THAT THE KING OF THAT COUNTRY FARMS OUT THESE DIAMONDMINES FOR 600000 CROWNS PER ANNUM RESERVING TO HIMSELF THE RIGHT OF ALL THE DIA MONDS THAT EXCEED TEN CARATS IN WEIGHT THERE ARE DIAMONDS THAT MOUNT TO 35 AND 40 CARATS AND THIS IS THE GREAT TREASURE OF THAT PRINCE 2 THAT THE MOST ESTEEMED FRUIT IN THOSE PARTS THE DURION OF THE BIG NESS AND SHAPE OF AN ORDINARY MELON HAS A VERY UNPLEASING AND EVEN UNTOL LERABLE SMELL LIKE TO THAT OF A ROTTEN APPLE 3 THAT RICE PROSPERS MOST IN WATERISH GROUNDS AND THAT THE FIELDS WHERE IT GROWS BEST RESEMBLES RATHER TO MARISNES THAN TO ANY PLOUGHED SOYLE YEA THAT THAT GRAIN HAS THE FORCE THOUGH 6 OR 7 FOOT WATER STAND OVER IT TO SHOOT ITS STALK ABOVE IT AND THAT THE STEM WHICH BEARS IT RI SES AND GROWS PROPORTIONABLY TO THE HEIGHT OF THE WATER THAT DROWNS THE FIELD 4 THAT THE WAY OF KEEPING ONES SELF HARMLESS FROM A WILD ELEPHANT WHEN HE RUNS DIRECTLY UPON ONE IS TO HOLD SOMETHING TO HIM AS A HAT A COAT A PIECE OF LINNEN WHICH HE SEISES ON WITH HIS TRUNK AND PLAYES WITH IT AS IF HE WERE PLEASED WITH THIS APPARENT HOMAGE DONE TO HIM AND SO PASSES ON IF HE BE IN A RAGE THAT THEN THE ONLY REMEDY IS TO TURN IN CESSANTLY BEHIND HIM TO THE LEFT SIDE IN REGARD THAT NATURALLY SAITH THIS AU THOR HE NEVER TURNS HIMSELF THAT WAY BUT TO THE RIGHT AND THE TIMETHERE IS TO TURN BECAUSE OF THE BEASTS UNWEILDINESS AFFORDS LEISURE ENOUGH TO CLIMBE UP SOME HIGH TREE OR TO MOUNT SOME STEEP GROUND ALL WHICH IF IT FAIL BY HOLDING ALWAYS HIS TAIL AND TURNING WITH HIM THE ANIMAL WILL BE TIRED AND GIVE OPPORTUNITY TO ESCAPE LONDON

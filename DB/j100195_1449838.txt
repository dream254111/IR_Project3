IINTRODUCTORY REMARKS IN the course of my examination of the British Museum MS Or 67 my attention was arrested by an interesting historicoliturgical document which on a closer study of its contents proved to be the longlost Megillah of the Egyptian Purim My principal guide in the identification of the document was the late Professor Graetzs reference to it in Volume IX of his Geschichte der Juden  and an examination of the sources to which he refers has helped to throw a good deal of fresh light on the subject After narrating the events connected with Ahmed Shaitans revolt against Sultan Soliman in 1524 and the deliverance of the Cairene Jews from the destruction which the rebel had designed for them Professor Graetz states in an elaborate note2 that there once existed a complete Megillah on these events and he then proceeds to name the  secondary sources which in default of the original Chronicle he had consulted These are i the anonymous  work entitled nity nilnIr 3 2 David Confortes nnrmnn mp 3 Joseph 1 Dritte verbesserte und vermehrte Ausgabe Leipzig I891 2 Op cit p 22 3 To this work Dr Gaster drew my attention before I consulted Graetz and as it is not identical with the booklet bearing the same title in Zedners Catalogue of the Hebrew Books in the British Museum see under Abraham Moses page 32 he kindly lent me his copy of the Hebrew text together with a Spanish translation of a part printed in the 274MEGTTLLATH MISSRAIM Ibn Vergas Additavtenta to rnlr tne and 4 The Chronicle of Joseph Sambary published in Dr Neubauers Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles To these may be added Joseph Cohens S3nn pY Wien I852 pp 956 and the short reference to the subject in the same authors n tmnsNms nri nrmn 45 vrin Lemberg 1859 part II fol 5 a As students will no doubt proceed to examine these secondary sources for themselves I will here only remark that special mention is made of the Megillah by Joseph Sambary 1 who finished his work in 1672 by David Con forte whose nniri gnp2 was written between I677833 and also in DbO mrnyI fol 19 b under SJnlmy D n1Db It may also be useful to notice that Joseph Sambarys account is on the whole in fuller agreement with the Megillah itself than Joseph Ibn Vergas Additamenta which were written over a hundred years earlier4 This is accounted for by the fact that Joseph Sambary was a native of Egypt6 and had himself taken part in the celebration of the Cairene Purim Some further references to several of the secondary sources will be found in the notes added to the translation of the scroll and a fuller and wider view of the historical events6 connected with Hebrew character The former appears to have been published at Smyrna in 1756 and the titlepage of the latter shows that it appeared at Constantinople in I767 1 Dr Neubauers Mediaeval Jewish Chronicles p 145 2 Edit Venice I746 fol 33 a 3 See Dr Steinschneiders Cat Lib Hebr Bibl Bodl p 858 4Completed in I554 5 See Neubauer op cit p xvii The writer ie J Sambary is well acquainted with Egypt his native country 6 It is interesting to notice that the British Museum also possesses a printed contemporary Latin Newsletter in which Ahmeds revolt to gether with certain subsequent events of Solimans reign are described This letter which was written within a few months after Ahmeds death dated June 29th 1524 was addressed by Michaelis Bocignolus to Gerardus Planias Caesareae Maiestatis secretarium The writer does not how ever appear to have possessed a very accurate knowledge of the events on which he wrote 275THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Ahmeds revolt may be gained by a perusal of the ac count given of it in HammerPurgstalls Geschichte des Ostannischen Reiches  There is at present no reason to doubt the statements of Joseph Sambary David Conforte and the author of DnIy nlrMYns who looked upon the Megillah as the com position of contemporaries of the events narrated therein and it is also only reasonable to suppose that the  savants of Egypt  nyDn rn of the former and the savants of the generation nilrn nn of the two latter include David Ibn Abi Zimra2 under whose Rabbinate Ahmeds revolt and hostility to the Jews broke out and Samuel Sidillo who conducted the special prayers and supplications  in his own Synagogue nryno pp3 It is at any rate certain that a composition to which a definite place was for a long number of years assigned in the Egyptian liturgy could only have been put forward under the direct sanction of the spiritual heads of the community and it therefore follows that the Megillah must have borne the imprimatur of the two honoured names just mentioned if it was not actually composed by them With regard to the style in which the scroll was written it can be seen at a glance that it was purposely composed in close imitation of the Book of Esther and although it is not quite free from nonBiblical words and construc tions it reads almost entirely like a Biblical narrative The imperfect with the wawconsecutive is regularly employed in exact conformity with classical usage and the document is also singularly free from involved con structions which form one of the marks of the Rabbinic and the semiRabbinic Hebrew style 1 Zweite verbesserte Ausgabe Pesth I834 vol II pp 368 2 See Graetz op cit pp 1921 3 See nrlrnlN snp fol 32 b Comp Neub op cit p 45 where it is stated that the Synagogue is called Dmn  r5n

days when King Soliman sat on the throne of his kingdom which was in Constantinople the great city he considered all the provinces of his kingdom and he sent to each province a chief to judge its people in righteousness and equity After these things King Soliman promoted one of his chiefs whose name was Ahmed Shaitan6 and he placed his seat above all the chiefs 1MS n15 2 The  in Tsr is evidently intended to mark the vowel of the n  on account of the pause and not to indicate a plural form 3 In the MS a word that looks like wqn probably some unknown abbreviation stands here In the translation I have assumed the word D1bt  peace Sultan Soliman or Sulaiman I surnamed the Magnificent reigned from I520 to I566 5 The text has and in many military camps 6 The Hebrew has  the wellknown Satan all through the Megillah By the term rrn the Arabic name lnna was probably meant to be 28iTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW that were with him And he sent him to be a ruler over the land of Egypt and he commanded him saying Egypt have I given to thee and in it shalt thou dwell and according to thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou Only be thou strong and very courageous to judge in righteousness and to discard unjust gain and the coinage 1 shalt thou issue in my name And Ahmed Shaitan came into the land of Egypt and he went up to the citadel and dwelt there And he began to oppress and to exact money and he did that which was evil in the sight of the Holy One 2 and the taxes increased in his days and Ahmed Shaitan forsook the command of the king and gathered together much substance and his spirit was not satisfied neither was his eye satisfied for he was a man of very great greed And his soul was greatly lifted up and he determined to rebel against the king and he collected much substance from all the people of Egypt and vain and light persons gathered round him and he numbered them and found them about two thou sand men And he made a covenant with them and remitted them their taxes and he distributed money among them to each man according to his value And he first stretched out his hand against the wealthy men who were in the citadel and he also killed about thirty persons of the force of King Soliman And he took all the armed men who came to him and he went and fixed his dwelling on the banks of the Nile And it came to pass when the remainder of the kings force saw that the wealthy men who had been in the citadel were killed and that Ahmed Shaitan had rebelled against King Soliman that the whole force assembled themselves and went up into the citadel and closed its gates upon them and they stayed in it for eight days And it came to pass when Ahmed Shaitan saw that the force of King Soliman listened not to his voice and that they had gone up into the citadel and rebelled against him that he consulted with his councillors and said unto them What should we do And they said unto him If thou wilt accept our counsel and act accordingly then shall we make thee king Now go and fight against the force of King Soliman and take the citadel and dwell in it then shall the kingdom be established in thy hand And vaguely represented In Turkish history Ahmed bears the name of traitor The two most important sovereign rights of the Sultan were the coinage and the ia ie the mention of his name in the public prayers at the mosque 2 The divine name is generally avoided in the Megillah In the translation the term Dow is rendered by the Holy One wherever it occurs 282MEGILLATH MISSRAIM 283 it came to pass when Ahmed Shaitan heard this saying that their counsel was wellpleasing in his eyes and he went and collected a thousand men from among the slaves together with the force that had gone up with him and there assembled themselves unto them about two thousand of the people of the land and he and all his people went up from behind the citadel to the top of the hill And he pre pared there the instruments of destruction and they continued to fight against him for three days so that they could not enter the citadel And it came to pass on the fourth day that he hurled upon them the instruments of destruction and he scaled one wall of the fortification and brought it down to the ground And it fell upon five hundred men of Ahmed Shaitans force and they drew them out from under the wall dead bodies And it came to pass on that day when the wall fell that the force of Ahmed Shaitan went up into the citadel  and killed ninety men of the force of King Soliman And the remainder of King Solimans force fled and escaped and the Holy One did not put it into the heart of Ahmed Shaitan to pursue them further On that day at the time when Ahmed Shaitan went up into the citadel his whole force made him king over them And at the time when they made him king over them they proclaimed in the streets of Cairo3 and in all the neighbouring cities that Ahmed Shaitan was made king And it came to pass when he had been made king that he laid a tax upon all the inhabitants of Egypt for he wanted to take away all their money And Ahmed Shaitans force came and said unto him Thou knowest 0 our lord the king what thy servants have done unto thee and that we have made thee king in Egypt And now if thy servants have found favour in thine eyes and if it please the king let a decree be given to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey and to take vengeance of them for they are our enemies and adversaries And Ahmed Shaitan said unto them The Jews are given unto you and do unto them as is pleasing in your eyes 4 And it came to pass when the Jews 1 Ie the force of Ahmed Shaitan 2 According to HammerPurgstalls op cit account Ahmed entered the citadel by an old disused waterconduit which had been pointed out to him This statement agrees with the circumstantial details of Ahmeds entry into the castle as narrated in DW nimvn s fol i8 b 3 It is well known thataj nrn is also used to designate Cairo and Dr2 is therefore here translated sometimes by  Egypt and sometimes by  Cairo according to the requirements of the respective passages in which it occurs 4 Both Joseph Sambary and David Conforte report that AhmedTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW heard this thing that they made a very grievous mourning and they cried with a loud and bitter cry And they proclaimed a fast and they wept and they put earth upon their heads and they put on sackcloth from the least amongst them even unto the greatest and the land mourned and all the inhabitants thereof languished And they continued fasting and crying every day until their weeping rose up to heaven The posts went out being hastened by the com mandment of Ahmed Shaitan and the decree was given in the quarter of the Jews and all the Jews were perplexed And it came to pass when the force of Ahmed Shaitan heard the commandment of their king that there assembled themselves together of them and of the people of the land about two thousand men And they came upon the city securely and they plundered all that belonged to them and they took much spoil And it was so that every one who found a Jew sought to kill him and they killed five 1 Jews And the Jews fled running in haste to save their lives for they said We be all dead men And a great cry arose in Cairo and one Jew died from great fear And the outcry of the children of Israel rose up to the Holy One to heaven and he remembered his covenant which he had made with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob There was one 2 man in the citadel of the city and God sent him to be my helper and deliverer and the supporter of my right hand And it was so that when the Jews were crying the matter was re ported to one of Ahmed Shaitans chiefs and he stood up before him for he was second to him in rank 3 And he said unto him If I have found favour in thy sight 0 king and if it please the king let the Jews alone for what is their transgression and what is their Shaitans anger against the Jews was caused by the part which Abraham de Castro who was set over the Egyptian mint took in making known to Sultan Soliman the designs of Ahmed with regard to the coinage In ubi rnvnon fol I9 a 51 na Dv2 rr5 n an iTS  anin 5pv Cai inDwp Dmmi r 1n niwi 5g Bocignolus writes Erat Cayri quidam Judaeus

exponit 1 It is plain from the Megillah itself that plunder was the main object of the enemy and that massacre was only resorted to as a means to that end 2 Note the play on the words rrn and ir Esther ii 5 Joseph Ibn Verga states that the name of this councillor was rn 3 The word Tmwr which is here translated literally is rendered by  Grand Vizir in the passages which follow 284MEGILLATH MISSRAIM sin that thou shouldst deliver them into the hand of those who seek to do them evil And if it be pleasing to the king let their silver and their gold be given into the treasuries of the king I will be surety for it at my hands thou mayest require it And Ahmed Shaitan said to the Grand Vizir Go and do as thou desirest and do to the whole people as is good in thine eyes for thou hast found favour in my sight And the Grand Vizir came and proclaimed in the quarter of the Jews Thus said the king Let no man stretch out his hand against the Jews And the Grand Vizir said to the Jews Peace shall be upon you fear not for the king has given orders concerning you And it came to pass when the force of Ahmed Shaitan had plundered the Jews that they took all the spoil and carried it into the house of one of the chiefs After these things Ahmed Shaitan desired of the Jews a hundred and fifty thousand great gold pieces1 and he also said If ye bring them not quickly I shall kill you with the sword And when the Jews heard this evil thing they mourned and could not answer him for they were terrified before him And it came to pass when the children of Israel saw that the hand of the Holy One had touched them that they threw earth upon their heads and blew the trumpet and they convoked an assembly and every one returned from his evil way and they cried unto the Holy One with a loud voice and with weeping And whilst they were weeping and making supplication before the Almighty some men from amongst them went up and fell down to the ground before Ahmed Shaitan but he listened not to them And Ahmed Shaitan imposed a tax upon the land and upon the people of Egypt and upon the merchants and he said unto them Bring unto me silver and gold without number And Ahmed Shaitan took from the Jews of Cairo much money and they were being seized by the hand of their enemies to smite them very sorely And when the tribulation and the evil decree pressed heavily upon them some of the Jews hid themselves and the command was given to all the people of Cairo that they should hang every Jew who should hide himself on the door of his house And every day the taskmasters stretched out their hands against the Jews to smite them 1 This agrees with the accounts given by Joseph Sambary and the author of Diy nir wn Joseph Ibn Verga has Fp3 nm Dnn The two former appear to have taken the words

came and seized the Jews to take from them their silver and their gold and everything that belonged to them And they cried to the Holy One in their trouble and that he may save them out of their distresses And they made supplication before the Holy One with a loud voice and the Holy One heard their groaning and there was not a house in Cairo in which there was not weeping and lamentation and sobbing And on the nineteenth day of the month Adar Ahmed Shaitan sought to destroy all the Jews that were in Cairo both young and old little children and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey And on the eighteenth day of the month Adar the Jews assembled themselves to stand for their life in prayer and supplica tion and great crying and in fasting and weeping and sackcloth and ashes were spread under many And the cry of the children of Israel went up to the Holy One and he heard their groaning and he re membered his covenant with them And God saw their works and their fasting and their sackcloth and he did not despise their humilia tion and he sent them help suddenly and he saved them from the hands of their enemies and of those who sought their hurt In that night our cry went up before God and our prayers were written in the book of remembrances and they were read before the king2 And he said I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and have heard their cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows On that day was a council held by the chiefs who remained of King Solimans force and who had been addressing Ahmed Shaitan with a double heart And they agreed to seize Ahmed Shaitan and they took with them thirty men of those who remained of King Solimans force And they went up to the citadel but they found not Ahmed Shaitan in the citadel for he was in the bath And it was told to them saying Behold he is in the bath and they went to him in order to seize him but he heard of it and fled before them And King Solimans force pursued Ahmed Shaitan and he heard of it and fled before them and they went up and found him not And it came to pass when Sultan Solimans chiefs saw that Ahmed Shaitan had fled that they went up into the citadel and dwelt therein And they hastened and proclaimed in all the streets of Cairo Peace and quietness be unto you and be ye not afraid And they said 1 Samuel Sidillo the venerable chief of one of the Cairo Synagogues vide stpra took a very prominent part in the arrangement and conduct of these services See the accounts of Joseph Sambary David Conforte and chw nrsiNn 2 Note the not very happy allusion to Esther vi i 286MEGILLATH MISSRAIM May our lord the King Soliman live for ever and there was very much joy and Cairo rejoiced and was glad The Jews had light and gladness and joy and honour And on the nineteenth day of the month Adar there was collected and assembled a great force and they put armour on them and they took them with them and King Solimans chiefs divided them into three parties and they pursued Ahmed Shaitan and certain men of Ahmed Shaitans force fled and hid themselves in the plantation of reeds And it was reported to King Solimans force that certain men had fled and that they were hidden in the plantation of reeds and they threw fire upon them and burnt them together with the plantation of reeds And King Solimans force came and they saw them burnt in the fire And it was told the force of Ahmed Shaitan that King Solimans force was pursuing them and their heart died within them and they forsook their horses and their arms and they went away and many of their men fled and threw them selves into the Nile and were drowned And King Solimans force came and they saw them dead on the banks of the Nile And Ahmed Shaitan and all his hosts fled to one of the cities of Egypt  and they made a covenant with them and they gave them food and drink And King Solimans force pursued the force of Ahmed Shaitan and they overtook them as they were coming out of the city2 and they destroyed the city and they plundered it and burnt a part of it with fire But the Jews who were in the city they plundered but did not kill one of them And on the twentyeighth day of the month Adar King Solimans force pursued Ahmed Shaitan and they overtook him and seized him and cut off his head And King Solimans force brought Ahmed Shaitans head fixed upon a spear and they hung it up on the gate cf Zuwailah3 before the eyes of all the people And it came to pass when King Solimans force entered Cairo carrying with them the head of Ahmed Shaitan that the people of Cairo rejoiced with a great rejoicing And when the 1 In HammerPurgstalls account p 38 the tribe of the BenuBakr is stated to have sheltered the rebel 2 In HammerPurgstall the city is named Mahallel 3 The

which I have referred U2 287THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Jews saw the salvation of the Holy One and the wonders which were done to them as in the days of Haman the Agagite who had sought to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women and to take the spoil of them for a preyfor as the Amalekite had counselled thus counselled also Ahmed Shaitan to do but the Holy One brought their counsel to nought and caused their thoughts to perish and their violent dealing came down upon their own patethe Jews were assembled and agreed to fast on the twentyseventh day of the month Adar and to make the twentyeighth day a feast and rejoicing and for sending portions one to another and gifts to the poor Because the Holy One had done to them marvels and wonderful things and had helped them out of the hands of those who had sought their life The Jews therefore who dwell in Cairo ordained and took upon them and upon their children and upon all who join themselves to them to fast on the twentyseventh day of the month Adar and to read this scroll on the twentyeighth day 1 of it and to make it a day of feast ing and rejoicing They therefore called these days the Days of Marvels 2 because he had done to them marvels and wonderful things and delivered them out of the hands of their enemies Thus may all the enemies of the Holy One and the enemies of thy peculiar people perish like Haman the Agagite and Ahmed Shaitan who had sought to destroy to kill and to cause to perish all Jews both young and old little children and women and to take the spoil of them for a prey But the Holy One in his mercy brought to nought their counsel and caused their thoughts to perish and they hanged them and their spirit and their breath of life perished but those that love him are like the rising of the sun in his strength and the land had rest And let us remember his wonderful deeds and his acts of loving kindness which he is doing unto us every day every hour and at all times he has saved us And we are thy people Amen Peace be upon Israel G MARGOLIOUTH Joseph Sambary David Conforte and the author of oD5r nrnwN correctly give the twentyeighth day of Adar as the date of the festival In Joseph Ibn Vergas account the fast of the twentyseventh appears to have become confused with the feast on the following day The chrono logical difficulty is clearly stated by Professor Graetz 2 The feast was known as the Cairene Purim In Graetz  Kairo anische Purim Furim alMissrajin 288

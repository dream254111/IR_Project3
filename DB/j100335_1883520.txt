RETURNS OF PRODUCTIVE AGENTS AND ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL IN PARTICULAR SUMMARY I The Returns of Productive Agents Carvers statement of the universal principle of diminishing returns 558Other writers have believed that a stage of cessation of return would be reached 559 The possible formulae for expressing the law 564 II The Produc tivity of Capital 1 Definition and measure of capital The word not explained by the writers using it in this connection 565First definition capital as intermediary products 567 Difficulties of measuring capital so defined 568 Second definition capital as advances 571Third definition capital as value advanced during a certain period of time 572In this last sense capital can be meas ured 575This definition has been used more or less implicitly by various economists 5792 Capital and the period of production how related under the definition proposed 582 BohmBawerks failure to consider the duration of advances 584 3 The productivity of capital BohmBawerks view the roundabout process more productive Criticisms of this view 586Its author does not prove it only illustrates it 589The thesis false 592 I ON THE RETURNS OF PRODUCTIVE AGENTS IN GENERAL IN the masterly study which he has published on the question of diminishing returns Professor Carver has maintained that the tendency toward diminishing returns558 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS does not manifest itself as was formerly believed simply with relation to productive agents combined in varying proportions with a fixed quantity of land but that this tendency is something universal Take any productive agent or group of productive agents If with this agent or group of agents which we suppose fixed we combine successively increasing quantities of that other agent or those other agents which must be added to it to obtain such and such sort of goods as one wishes to have then according to Carver the product will to be sure increase more quickly at first than the productive agent or agents which have been varied but a time will come when the increase of the product will be less rapid than that of our agent or agents when the returns of the latter in other words will relatively diminish I consider Carvers thesis true and moreover I con sider that it constitutes one of the most important truths of economic science At the same time Carver in ex pounding his ideas on the problem of diminishing returns has expressed a view which I regard as inexact at least partially My intention here is to point out this error which I think I see in Carvers work and at the same time to contribute towards clearing up the question till now so hazy of the productivity of capital Carver illustrates the law of diminishing returns with the following formulke If x acres of land with y units of capital and labor give p product x acres of land with ay units of capital and labor will give a product superior to p but inferior to ap If y units of capital and labor with x acres of land give p product y units of capital and labor with ax acres of land will give a product superior to p but inferior to ap I See Carver The Distribution of Wealth 1904 chap 3PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 559 When the quantity of land remaining the same says he the quantity of labor and capital is increased the product does not increase as much as the labor and capi tal If the quantity of labor and capital does not change and the quantity of land is increased the product will not increase as much as the land If I understand Carvers thought one productive agent remaining constant and the others increasing the product from the moment when the tendency to diminishing returns begins to act will increase less quickly than these pro ductive agents It will increase less and less quickly but it will continue incessantly to increase Carver on the point which I wish to discuss has in short only universalized the conception which many theorists had expressed before him with regard to agri cultural returns Read for example Marshall The application of increased capital and labour to land1 writes that author  adds a less than proportionate amount to the produce raised 2 To be sure other economists had had a somewhat different conception Their opinion was that by the application to a given area of land of increasing quantities of capital and labor one must arrive after a certain time at a maximum product and that afterwards production must necessarily remain stationary Among the authors who have treated of population certain ones have shown that they imagined a  fulness of cultivation an extreme limit for the production of the means of subsistence Such is the case of Wallace Turgot writes The earth has a limited fertility and supposing it ploughed manured marled ditched irrigated weeded as much as it can be 1 Pages 6768 The italhes are mine 2 Prnciples of Economics 5th ed p 153 IV 3  1 It is I who italicize the word adds 3 See his Dissertation on the Numbers of Manklnd in Ancient and Modern Times 1753 passzm560 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS it is evident that all further expense would be useless  there is then a maximum of production which it is impos sible to go beyond and when it has been reached advances produce absolutely nothing 2 Assuming a specially tech nical point of view Liebig taught that beyond a certain measure all supplementary ploughing and manuring was powerless to increase the production of plants3 Quite recently an author who like Carver proclaims the uni versality of the tendency to diminishing returns Valenti said in a quite general manner that the increase of any one agent in a combination of productive agents after a certain point adds nothing to the product4 To say that the quantity of the product when one pro ductive agent remains invariable and the quantity of the others increases augments indefinitely but less and less and to say that it increases to a certain maximum to remain stationary afterwards amounts to about the same thing What I wish to establish is that both proposi tions in so far as they are general propositions are false Grant that 1 x units of a group of productive agents with y units of another group give p product it can then be granted that 2 ax units of the first group with ay units of the second group give ap product Perhaps indeed it will be said that the process from I Turgot adds here Such increase might even be harmful  One might be tempted to see in these words an anticipation of the conception which I am going to state presently I do not think however that they have that meaning 2 Observations sur un mnmoire de M de SaintPdravy CEuvres de Turgot 4d Daire i  p 420 3 According to Esslen Das Gesetz des abnehmenden Bodenertrages seit J Von Liebig Munich 1905 pp 89 4Principil di scienza economic Florence 2d ed 1909  62 p 167 The way in which Valenti formulates his proposition is not very happy as may be seen by consulting his bookPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 561 formula 1 to formula 2 is not legitimate When an enterprise is enlarged by the proportionate multiplication of all the productive agents which are employed in it the product may be found to be increased more or less than the productive agents in question But to this observa tion I shall reply by assuming that the process from my first formula to my second formula does not necessarily express the process from a relatively small enterprise to a larger enterprise There is no reason why the second formula should not relate to enterprises like thator thoseto which the first related but a times as numerous And under this hypothesis I may add it will surely be true2 We know on the other hand that the return of a productive agent or group of agents when these agents increase in proportion to the others may increase at first We can thus have 3 x units of one group of productive agents with ay units of another group give alp product which is larger than ap Let us compare formulae 3 and 2 This comparison will show us that if with a fixed quantityayof a cer tain group of productive agents we combine increasing quantities of other agents1 at first and a afterwards we may see a decrease not only in the relative return of these agents but in the absolute product 1 Carver expresses at first the  law of economies of large production saying p 66 that if for example x acres of land with y units of capital and labor give P product ax acres of land with ay units of capital and labor will give either more than aP or less than aP These formulae relate to simple enterprises but noth ing in them shows it 2 After having expressed the  law of economies of large production as we have seen in the preceding note Carver coming back to this law says pp 9091 that when an enterprise is enlarged the relation changes between a certain factor of the production the management which remains fixed and the ensemble of the other factors In that way he thinks he can reduce the law of economies of large production to that of the variation of returns It seems to me it would be neces sary to make some reservations upon this reductionthis is not the place to state thembut it certainly contains some truth562 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS Thus this proposition very different from that of Carver on the same question is drawn from the very fact of increasing returnsa fact acknowledged by Carver There is moreover in the latters book a passage in which the truth which I am trying to establish appears clearly enough Carver somewhere considers a production which would employ land and labor If the land is gratui tous he says it will be advantageous to extend the labor over as much land as is necessary in order that this labor may give the maximum product And if we consult the table to which Carver refers us2 we can see that by ex tending the same labor over a larger quantity of land we shall have less product The table in question shows us that if we apply labor over 10 acres of land it is for an outlay of 20 days labor that the return from the labor will be the greatest If we lay out 20 days labor each day will produce 19 bushels of grain whereas with 10 days labor or with 40 the number of bushels produced per day will be only 15 Suppose then that we have at our disposal 20 days labor If we lay it out on 10 acres we shall obtain 20 X 19 bushels or 380 Or shall we lay it out on 20 acres 10 days laid out on 10 acres give 10 X 15 or 150 bushels 20 days laid out on 20 acres will give twice as much or 300 bushels And thus it is better having at our disposal 20 days to lay them out on 10 acres than on 20 I think I have established that the increase of one factor or group of factors of production the other factors remain ing constant might result in a diminution of product Let us now look to experience for examples Here is a field of a certain area If we apply to it in definitely increasing quantities of labor what will the product become One may say that it will increase indefinitely It can even be always increased it would Page 71 See also pp 7273 2 Page 58PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 563 seem by more minute care given to the plants only after a certain time this increase will become extremely slow In any case the product will never be found to diminish It is the above case it will be noted which almost exclusively occupied the authors who before Carver have speculated on diminishing returns We must not then be surprised if Carver universalizing the views of these authors has been led to think that the increase of one productive agent the others remaining constant could not diminish the product But let us imagine that we lay out our fixed quantity of labor on greater and greater tracts of land that we make 10 men for example cultivate 5 hectares in grain then 10 hectares then 100 then 1000 then 10000 The product which they will be able to obtainif in proportion as the land to be cultivated becomes vaster they force themselves to spread their labor over all the land that is given themwill diminish after a certain time It will even finally become nil Another example An individual devotes all his activity to the directing of an enterprise Let us suppose that the enterprise enlarges indefinitely After a certain time the increasing difficulty which our individual will experience both in organizing and in overseeing the conduct of his business may and doubtless must have as a consequence not only a diminution in the productivity of the different agents employed but a diminution in the absolute product To have done with my general remarks I shall offer an observation apropos of the demonstration that Carver gives us of the universality of the law of diminishing returns3 Let us suppose says Carver that this law is 1 It might however be remarked that a time will come when there will no longer be room in our field for a greater number of men 2 I am considering here productivity and product from the point of view which certain authors call technical I do not take into consideration that diminution in the value of products which may result from the necessity of going to seek more distant markets and from the descendant form of the curve of demand The con sideration of this additional datum of the question would corroborate my assertion 3 Pages 6768564 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS verified for certain productive agents in so far as they are combined with others which remain fixed It will then be true with relation to these latter inasmuch as they are made to vary and as the former remain stable Let us state for example these two formulke 1 x units of a certain productive agent with y units of another agent give P product 2 x units of the first agent with ay units of the second give more than P On the other hand one can write 3 ax units of the first agent with ay units of the second give aP product Now the comparison of formulhe 2 and 3 shows that given a certain quantity of units of the second agentor ayif the number of units of the first is raised from I to a the product increases in a less pro portion In other words that certain increases of the first agent are accompanied by a decrease of the returns which it gives Carver here neglects the case which might occur where we should have 4 x units of the first agent with ay units of the second give less than P If we compare formulae 3 and 4 we shall see that certain increases of the first productive agent the second remaining constant are accompanied by increasing returns of the former3 3 The demonstration which I have just pointed out is the inverse of the one above by which starting from the fact of increasing returns I proved that certain increases of productive agents might be accompanied by an absolute diminution of the product One more remark If we combine two productive agents M and N it is only for relatively large quantities of N that the increase of N will be found to bring about the diminution of the product It follows that it is only for rela tively small quantities of M that the returns of this factor will be found to in crease with its augmentation And the converse is also truePRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 565 II ON THE PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 1 Definition and Measure of Capital I wish to examine now how the product varies when the relation of capital to the other productive agents changes But before proceeding to this examination it is indis pensable to determine carefully what capital is as a dis tinct productive agent how it must be defined and meas ured if we wish to be able to speak of a relation between capital and the other productive agents Let us cast a glance at the writings of the economists who have treated of diminishing returns It is a fact worthy of remark that these authors at least in the pas sages relative to the variations of returns do not explain what they mean by the word capital Turgot in the passage which I have quoted speaks of the relation of the product to the avances and by this word he designates the capital and labor applied to land without making between these two things any distinction West in his Essay on the Application of Capital to Land2 announces to us that he is going to study as the title of his work indicates the variations which are produced in the returns of capital when one applies more and more capital to the land But immediately I he begins to speak to us not of the returns of capital but of the re turns of labor He asserts that labor in agriculture gives diminishing returns Malthus when he deals with agricultural returns considers sometimes capital applied to land sometimes capital and labor6 Ricardo speaks here of capital or of labor or of capital and labor in an 1I Euvres Md Daire i pp 418422 2 1815 3 Page 2 4 As early as p 3 5 Pages 6 and 7 IThe Nature and Progress of Rent 1815 pp 17 29 36 41 Principles of Political Economy 1st ed 1820 pp 153197566 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS apparently indifferent manner Similarly Stuart Mill2 Marshall takes care most frequently to speak of the doses of capital and labor applied to the land3 but he some times lets fall one of these terms4 Among the more recent authors Bullock Carver Valenti always distinguish capital and labor but in what they have written on diminishing returns no very precise indication is to be found about the way in which they distinguish these two notions I mean by no means to maintain that the economists whom I have reviewed have all failed to form a clear con ception of capital For several of them such an assertion would be entirely false But there are some among the authors I have quoted of whom this is quite the case And I shall say more among those who have had a clear con ception of capital it seems that certain ones had a vague feeling that their conception of capital was not the one which permits us to assign capital its place in the theory of diminishing returns and in a broader way in the the ory of production At least one is tempted thus to interpret the hesitation the indecision which is manifest in the formulae which they use What then is capital after all for these authors who have busied themselves especially with the productivity of capital with the role of capital in production Ordi narily the authors in question make capital consist of those goods which are employed in production and which have been produced Capital consists to use the ex I Principles chap 2 See for example the end of paragraph in Gonners edition 1891 2 Principles notably IV chap 3 3 Principles I chap 12 paragraphs 12  See for example p 155 n 2 IV chap 3 paragraph 21 5 The Variation of Productive Forces Quarterly Journal of Economics August 1902PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 567 pression of BohmBawerk of intermediary products And thus those economists who recognize only labor as the original factor of production or who at least in their speculations on production are inclined to pay particu lar attention to labor and to assign it a preponderant place will say that capital is past labor collaborating with present labor A cultivator for example expends labor to plough his land but in order to plough he needs a plough This plough which has been constructed a longer or shorter period before is capital it represents past labor the help of which renders more efficacious the labor at present being expended by our ploughman Such is the conception of capital most frequent among the theorists of production With regard to this con ception it seemed to me necessary to make one remark at the very start If one is to employ in the theory of production the concept of intermediary product it is important that one should understand this concept in the broadest manner Suppose some men are breaking land in order to permit it to produce harvests this improvement of the land which will result from the break ing will have to be regarded as an intermediary product It is this which the labor of our men produces immedi atelyif one may be permitted the expressionand will contribute afterwards to the production of harvests In capitalistic production BMhmBawerk teaches us man does not create in a direct manner the property which he desires He resorts to detours Very well But what must be noted is that these detours do not always consist in creating in the strictest sense of the word goods from which the former will come I mean in producing isolable goods How can the intermediary products be measured Our authors measure them by what they have cost to 1 In German Zwuschenprodukte568 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS obtain Thus wishing to estimate the capital that is to say the intermediary product which a laborer em ploys they will consider often the labor which is incor porated in this intermediary property they will esti mate that past labor which collaborates with present labor But then how can the relation be established of capi tal to the other productive agents Here several solu tions may be imagined Let us examine them in order 1 Suppose a cultivator who cultivates his field for a year Let us say that for his cultivation he employs land labor and capital and by this last word let us un derstand for example the machines the instruments which our cultivator has acquired for his exploitation If our cultivator pays 10000 francs for the rent of his field if he expends 20000 francs for manual labor and 20000 for the machines instruments etc we may say that the expense in capital is to the other expenses as one to two As one may see we are considering here one group of pro ductive operations neglecting the operations which have preceded these and which technically form a part of the same productive process Let us suppose that our cul tivator before undertaking his cultivation has himself manufactured the machines and the instruments which he will have to use Then with the manner of reckoning which I have indicated the capital will disappear In such conditions it is apparent that this manner of reck oning implies a contradiction for to concentrate attention to a certain stage of a productive process is to invite us the very use which is made here of the expression  inter mediary products shows it plainly enoughto go back further than this stage I See for example Thunen Der isohrte Staat 2d part 1st division paragraphs 89 BohmBawerk Positive Theorie des Capitales II i pp 9697 Einige strittige Fragen der Capitalstheorie l 2 pp 1113 BohmBawerk does not re duce capital to past labor exclusively He indicates very well that into the constitution of capital there enters still another element the element of naturePRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 569 2 If one wishes to speculate on capital one must include a productive process which is complete from a technical point of view or else limit ones self to a frag ment of such a process which from the economic point of view will form a complete whole as was the case with our cultivating enterprise above but then in order to define capital one must not go beyond this fragment Submitting then to this condition one can measure the quantity of capital by the sum of the intermediary products which intervene in one way or another in the produc tive process in other words by the sum of the inter mediary products which are created or bought from the beginning of the process until the acquisition of the fruits But as one will observe that the acquisition of the fruit is always separated by an interval of time how ever small it may be from the productive operations which have prepared it that there is not strictly speak ing any productive act which gives its product instan taneously and that thus every operation of production may and must be regarded as giving rise at the start to intermediary products then one will be persuaded that wishing to measure the capital as I have just indicated we shall arrive at making it equal to the sum of the out lays of production or of the advances The ratio of the capital to the other productive agents will be the same as if the capital were identified with the advances and this relation will always be a ratio of one 3 One may establish the ratio of capital to the other productive agents by classifying under the first rubric those intermediary products only which are employed in the very last stage of the productive process For ex ample in a forest exploitation the capital will be measured by the amount of the expenses of planting etc in short 1 I shall have occasion to come back to this subject for I shall have to speak of the conception which identifies capital with the  advances570 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS of all the expenses which are anterior to the cutting This conception is it seems to me the one which is suggested to us rather than the others when we are told that capital is past labor collaborating with present labor It seems to me to challenge very serious criticism In the first place is it possible to establish a demarcation between this last stage of the productive process which we must isolate and the others or again to speak as cer tain authors do between present labor and past labor Shall we not be led when we examine things carefully to reduce the last stage of production the present labor to nothing A workman to finish the manufacture of an object takes ten days and in his labor if he has the help of instruments he employs materials which altogether have cost ten days labor Can one say that the manu facture of the object in question has required a capital of the value of ten days labor Why should not one con sider as present labor only the labor of the last day which would make the value of capital employed equal to nineteen days of labor Why should not one confine ones self to only the work of the last hour of the last second of the last instant It seems that this is what we should do And in this way once more the measure of the intermediary products will be found to coincide with that of the productive advances Let us admit that it is legitimate not to reduce present labor to the labor of the last instant Let us do like those authors who isolating at the end of the productive process a stage of a certain duration regard this last stage as being in no respect capitalistic Then with the manner of measuring capital which I have indicated we shall arrive at strange results Here is a production in which one thousand units of manual labor are expended ten years before the obtaining of the product Here is anotherPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 571 production in which one thousand units of manual labor are expended one month before the obtaining of the product and in which it would take five units of manual labor to finish the product The first production under the conception of capital we are here considering would not be more capitalistic than the second This example suffices I think to show that a measure of capital like that which is occupying us departs from what is per mitted by usage And it will also be granted I am surewhat is still more importantthat it could not have any scientific utility I come now to that second conception of capital which makes capital consist in the advances which are made for production Undertaking certain productive enterprises I am compelled to advance a certain sum This sum which I advanceand which I hope to recover after a certain time increased by a surplusis as is currently said the capital which I place or invest in these operations which I am undertaking Capital according to the new definition which we have decided upon is property seen from the point of view of its valueproperty which might be consumed which might be employed to procure an immediate or almost immediate satisfaction and of which we make such a use that we shall recover it or have its product only after the expira tion of more or less time Let us see then since that is IThe definition of capital which is indicated here is the same one that r have adopted in my Intdret du capital see paragraphs 37 and in my Manuel ddconomique paragraph 86 It was a thorough study which I have recently made of the returns of productive agents which revealed to me the necessity of correcting it or rather of completing it I shall note in passing that our second definition of capital in so far as it is distinguished from the first is scientifically very much superior to it It makes capital something correlative to what may be called capitalization and it also connects the notion of capital with that of interest It invites us to examine why capitalization encounters obstacles why capital obtains interest etc 572 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS what interests us what relations this definition establishes between capital and the other productive agents Capital here is the productive advances But in productionwe have already seenall outlays are advances A landed proprietor putting his land under cultivation expends land He also expends manual labor Neither expense will give its product until later Our landowner then renounces for a time the value which he would get from his land if for example he enjoyed it as a country seat he renounces for a time the value of the manual labor which he employs and doing this he employs capital Capital in short is the expenses of production whatever they may be in so far as these expenses are not immediately instantaneously productive And thus if you wish capi tal is quite essentially distinct from the other productive agents from land and labor It is again if you like that land and labor considered from a special point of view But quantitatively it is not distinct from land and labor It has no measure of its own It will then be impossible to speak of variations of capital with relation to the other productive agents to speak of returns of a variable productivity of capital We are thus led to consider a third concept which will be the preceding concept completed by a new element This third concept is that of the expenses of production in so far as they constitute advances and as these advances are made for a certain period With this concept we are in the presence of a productive agent if one may be per mitted the expression which not only is essentially dis tinct from the others but which is also distinct from them quantitativelyof a productive agent which has its own measure and which in that way may and must be regarded as being added to the others The obtaining of a certainPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 573 product for example will require an expensein land and laborof 10000 francs These 10000 francs will have been advanced during an average period say of six months or of a year or of two years and this average period of waiting for the product will be in the production something which will have to be taken into consideration How shall we designate the new concept which we have formed Here we find ourselves confronted by a serious difficulty of vocabulary Jevons proposes when a pound is invested in a production for five years that one speak of five poundyears and as a general expression he em ploys that of amount of investment of capital He wishes to have a distinction drawn between the amount of investment of capital and the amount of capital in vested the former being equal to the latter multiplied by the duration of the investment But I shall call attention to the fact that the correspondence of the two expressions does not convey the relation of the two concepts And especially it seems to me necessary to express the first concept by a single word seeing the prime importance which it has for economic science What word shall we choose The usage of language it cannot be denied dissuades us from using the word  capi tal In current language as Jevons has plainly felt capital is advances considered from the point of view of their amount and not at all from the point of view of the period for which they are made On the other hand however economic theory assigns to capital a special r6le in production and it is not possible to assign it this special r6le we have seen unless by the word  capital we under stand the expenses of production inasmuch as they are made a determinate time before the obtaining of the product 1 Theory of Political Economy chap 7 See Quantitative Notions concerning Capital574 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS In presence of these two contrary reasons I admit that I feel greatly embarrassed I am inclined however for the moment to give the word capital the sense which permits us to continue to see in capital a factor of pro duction quantitatively distinct from the others And thus in the following pages I shall employ this word to designate the concept which occupies us at this moment The word  advances designating the productive expenses in so far as they are not to give their product immediately the word capital will designate the result of the multi plication of the amount of the advances by the duration of their investment Shall we illustrate by examples the definition of capital at which we have arrived A cultivator employs a field during a certain year for a certain production He ex pends upon it so many days of manual labor If he ex pends nothing else his capital will be the value of the use of the field it will be the value of the days labor in so far as these values are advanced for a certain period It will be if you wish 10000 francs in so far as they are advanced on the average for six months In reality our cultivator employs besides the land and the manual labor instru ments Suppose for the sake of simplicity that these instruments are worn out in the year of cultivation which we are considering These instruments will represent with relation to him along with the land and labor a new factor of the production And if they cost 3000 francs if they last eight months on the average the capital of our cultivator will be increased by 3000 francs X 8 months Now if we assume the social point of view and wish to include the total of the productive operations which lead to the harvest the instruments of which we have just spoken will cease to represent a distinct agent in production They will be replaced by the land by the labor which have enabled them to be created andPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 575 moreover by capital this capital corresponding to the value of the land and labor in question multiplied by the period for which it has been advanced I have just shown how capital should be measured The measure which I have just indicated however is only one of the measures which may be adopted There are two measures for capital and there are two measures for the other factors of productions The land the labor can be measured physically thus one may speak of the use of so many hectares for so much time of so many days of manual labor And they can be measured from the point of view of value Similarly for capital When I measure capital by a certain value advanced during a certain time that is be it understood a somewhat physi cal measure for the value does enter into my measure but it does not enter alone To measure capital from the point of view of value is to express it in value and in value alone and in order to do that we must put in place of the product of the multiplication of the value advanced by the period of the advance a sacrifice which corresponds to that product or better in an economy which admits of loans the interest which corresponds to it If for example the rate of interest is 5 per cent then the expense in capital of any one who in a production had advanced 50000 francs and waited for the product an average of two years will be 5000 francs considering sim ple interest and a certain sum larger than 5000 francs considering as we certainly must do interest compounded When one speculates on the productivity of agents is it the technical measure or the measure in terms of value that should be adopted In such speculations one compares certain productive agents supposed to be fixed with other agents which are made to vary In the col umn of agents supposed to be fixed one may adopt either one of the two measures indifferently In the other col576 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS umn if one has only one agent one can likewise adopt whichever measure one prefers But if one has two or more agents then it will be absolutely necessary to em ploy the measure in terms of value for this measure is the only one which for all the productive agents what ever they may be reposes on one same principle It is the only one which permits of totalizations and in the hypothesis which we are assuming it is the variation of the sum of the productive agents of the second column the consequences of which we are investigating If for example we take on the one hand the use of so much land and on the other we consider the application of increas ing quantities of labor and capital to this fixed quantity of land we shall have in each case to find the sum of the labor and capital and for that we shall have to measure the labor and capital from the point of view of their value When one wishes to study the productivity of capital one will consider it with respect to the total of the other expenses of production and one will suppose it varying while the total in question remains fixed Thus one can adopt for capital either of the two existing measures and the other expenses of production will have to be measured in value We know now how with that definition of capital which I have proposed capital must be measured By this measure we shall arrive at results quite different from those which one has if one defines capital as consisting of the intermediary products or of the advances of production Suppose two forests planted at the same time with the same expense One is cut at the end of ten years the other at the end of twenty years Suppose the expense of the cutting is the same in each case Suppose besides for the sake of simplicity that between the transplanting and the cutting of the trees no expense intervenesthatPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 577 we do not take into consideration for example the value of the use of the land during the time which the trees are allowed to grow In that way with my definition the capital will be two times as great in one case as in the other If on the other hand we identify capital with the advances it will be the same in the two cases If it is identified with the intermediary products to which the expenses of the last productive stage are applied it will again be the same thing There are however cases where it may seem that the three conceptions of capital which I have carefully dis tinguished happen to coincide where it seems that know ing the advances or the intermediary products employed we know ipso facto the capitalsuch as I have defined itand inversely Suppose a manufacturer undertaking a certain produc tion He advancesI assume for the sake of simplic ity that he does it all at once50000 francs At the end of six months he obtains the product awaited and at the same time he begins again an operation exactly similar to the first This second operation after six months would be followed by a third and so forth At any moment which we select the advances of our manu facturerI mean those advances which he has not yet recoveredamount to 50000 francs and the intermediary products which he employs it is evident amount to the same sum Whatever period on the other hand we may consider the capital employed by our manufacturer is equal to 50000 francs multiplied by the period in ques tion We can then say simply that his advances amount to 50000 francs or that he is employing in his enter prise 50000 francs worth of intermediary products and we can also say that he is employing a capital of 50000 francs without specifying that this capital is employed for a determined period If we know that the advances578 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS in circulation of our manufacturer or the intermediary products which he employs are at any moment 50000 francs we shall know that in a given period he employs a capital equal to the product of 50000 francs by the period in question and inversely The remark which I just have made would hold good also for all those productions which may be called per petualI mean for all those operations which do not cease with the obtaining of a certain product but which are continued and renewed at least when these oper ations are regular in the sense that the advances in course of use remain constant and that the period of the advances is fixed And one can also without de parting far from the truth apply this remark to the econ omy of society for in society taking things as a whole production offers from the point of view both of the amount of the advances in course of use or of the inter mediary products employed as of the period of waiting for the products that regularity of which I have just spoken It is important however to see clearly the meaning of the preceding remark And first it must be under stood this remark does not apply to a certain sort or to certain sorts of productive processes which would be at least from the economic point of viewcomplete pro ductive processes What I have had in mind here is sections from perpetual productions or from complexes of production Now if one wishes to study the role of capital in production it must be considered in economi cally complete productive processes But this is not all In the hypotheses which I have indicated we know the amount of capital employed in a given period by the amount of advances in course of use or of the intermediary products used at a given moment and inversely We do not know the amount of the capiPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 579 tal employed in a given period by the amount of the advances made or of the intermediary products used in this same period nor inversely Let us go back to the example above Our manufacturer in one year used a capital equal to 50000 francs X 1 year Here is another however who advancing for the first time like the former 50000 francs does not recover them till the end of a year In a year he too will have used a capital which is measured by 50000 francs X 1 year At any moment he will have had just like the other 50000 francs worth of advances in circulation or of intermediary products But in the year the advances will have been only 50000 francs whereas the other will have advanced twice 50000 francs and the same difference will exist as far as the intermediary products are concerned Now in order to speak of a correspondence between the three conceptions of capital which I have distinguished it is absolutely necessary since one of the three notions relates to a certain period of time that the other two relate to this same period and not to one instant Shall we show now that if other authors have not de fined capital as I have done they have acknowledged sometimes in a more or less implicit manner and have felt more or less obscurely that this was the definition which imposed itself When Ricardo applies himself to demonstrating that the value of any good depends not only on the labor which has been expended to produce it but also on the time which elapses before it can be sold does he not invite us to conceive capital in so far as it must be dis tinct from labor in the manner which I have proposed Jevons identifies capital with what I have called ad vances But we have seen that beside the notion of 1 Prnoiples chap 1  4580 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS capital he soon places that of investment of capital And it is this second notion which at once in his theory becomes the more important He will examine for ex ample how the product varies when the expenses of production remaining the same and consequently the capital the period of waiting varies that is to say the investment of capital He will tell us that when the productive process is lengthened the rate of interest is determined by the relation between the increase of the investment of capital on the one hand and on the other hand the surplus of product obtained BdhmBawerk maintains that the relative quantity of capital employed in production is proportional to the period of production and that permits him when he wishes to trace a scheme of the productivity of capital to substitute for the notion of capitalof that capital which he has defined as consisting of the intermediary products employed by the productionthat of the period of the productive process We shall see how he justifies this substitution But it is permissible to suppose that he was led to make it partly by an intuition which he had of the manner in which capital must be defined in the theory of production Marshall understands by capital all the property except land which give a revenue That is quite a classic definition He teaches us that capital is the result of labor combined with abstinence or waiting But he cannot help after that introducing the consideration of the period of this waiting He will tell us for example that when labor is replaced by capital in reality it is labor accompanied by little waiting which is being re placed by labor accompanied by much waiting3 And I Theory of Political Economy chap 7 General Expression for the Rate of Interest 2 Principles II 4  5 3 VI 1 paragraph 9 VI 2 paragraph 9 pp 523 540541PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 581 better still In a certain passage Marshall tells us what we must understand by those doses of labor and capital of which it is always a question in the theories on the dimin ishing returns of agriculture To estimate these doses it is necessary to add to the cost of the manual labor expended the interest on the advances2 What does that mean except that capital in so far as distinct from labor is the very value of the labor considered at the same time in its amount and from the point of view of the period for which it is advanced We must not be surprised that these authors have not defined capital as I have felt bound to do Nor must we be surprised that several of them have shown that they felt inclined to arrive at the definition which I have pro posed They have been prevented from adopting this definition by the usage of the several languages which makes capital consist of property or of a value and not of the product of the multiplication of the value by a period But on the other hand as Marshall has well said the word  capital scientifically has its most im portant use in the inquiry how the three agents of pro duction land labor and capital contribute to producing the national income and how that income is distributed among the three agents3 Now capital we have seen cannot figure in the theory of production as a really dis tinct agent unless it is defined as I have defined it In the theory of distribution on the other hand the concept of capital is correlative to that of interest Now it is sufficiently well known that interest is proportionate to what I would call capital that is to say to advances considered both in their amounts and in their period I IV 3 paragraph 8 p 171 2 The interest of the capital employed says Marshall but saying this he is using the word capital in the same sentence in two different senses 8 Principles II 4 paragraph 5 p 78582 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 2 Capital and the Period of the Productive Process What relation is there between capital and the duration of the productive process I shall be very brief on this question which is already settled at least implicitly in the preceding pages In a production an absolute increase of capital may be accompanied by an abridgment of the productive process Take for example a cultivation for which 2000 francs are spent one year before the harvest 2000 francs six months before the harvest and 2000 francs at the time of the harvest Suppose that to these cultivating opera tions a new one were added which takes place three months before the harvest and which necessitates a supplementary expense of 2000 francs The quantity of capital will be found to be increased by 2000 francs X 3 months And at the same time the average period of waiting will have diminished It was originally six months since 2000 X 12  2000 X 6  2000 X   6 It will now be only 51 months since 2000 X 12 2000 X 62000 X 32OOO X 0 8000  525 But if an absolute increase of the capital may be accom panied by a diminution of the period of the productive process so a relative increase of capital will necessarily correspond to a lengthening of the productive process and inversely Likewise a relative diminution of the capi tal and an abridgment of the productive process can never exist independently In the case indicated above the productive process was abridged and at the same time the relative importance of the capital was diminished since the relation of the capital to the productive expenses shifted from 2000 X12  2000 X 6  2000 X O to 6000 2000 X 12  2000 X 6  2000 X 3  2000 X 0 that i 8000  ta i from 6 to 525PRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 583 It must be understood that when I speak of relative capital I consider capital as I have already said we should do in its relation with the totality of the other expenses of production and with nothing else Let us return to the same example If we wish to make capital relative to the surface of land cultivated then the absolute increase of the capital would also be a relative increase On the other hand it will have been noticed that the numbers which indicate the relative size of the capital in the operations we are considering are exactly the same as those which indicate the period of the productive processes This signifies that the relative size of the capi tal is nothing else than the very period of the productive process And in fact if we call a in a production the amount of the advances made and call t the average time of waiting for the product the capital will be equal to a X t And it is immediately evident that aX t a t Then if we call capitalistic degree of a production the rela tive size of the capital in this productionand that is what the expression ought to signifythis capitalistic degree will depend on the period of the productive process since we have just seen that the relative size of the capital depends upon it Under the definitions of capital which depart from that which I have adopted the correspondence is lost between the relative size of the capital or the capitalistic degree of production and the period of the latter If we identify capital with the productive advances then whatever be the period of the productive process the relative size of the capital will remain the same or better there will be no relative size of the capital If capital is identified with the intermediary products then either it will be as stated above or elsesupposing we measure the intermediary products in a certain way which we have seenwe shall584 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS have different results but results which will not assure the correspondence I have spoken of Suppose a produc tion in which 10000 francs are expended a year in advance and 10000 immediately before the obtaining of the product Suppose on the other hand another production in which 10000 francs are expended six months in advance and 10000 immediately before the product is obtained The period of the productive process is longer in the first production And yet the quantity of intermediary products would be the same in the first case as in the second and the quantity of capital so measured would be the same BdhmBawerk who makes capital consist in the inter mediary products has himself asserted however that a production is all the more capitalistic in other words that the proportion of capital employed in it is all the greater when the waiting for the product that is the average interval between the expenses of production and the obtaining of the product is longer This proposition appears evident to BohmBawerk It is for him  of axiomatic clearness 2 Nevertheless he takes the trouble to justify it3 A people he says has at its disposal in a given space of time a certain quantity of original pro ductive forces 4 Since capital then consists of past labor and of productive forces of nature which have been so to speak stored up then the longer the average duration of the productive processes the greater the quantity of capital which collaborates in each period with the original productive forces of that period If Positive Theorie p 94 see also the Positive Theory of Capital and its Critics Quarterly Journal of

destination one boat an hour the length of the voyage will determine the number of boats on the way at any moment It must be carefully observed how B6hmBawerk reasons He considers a crosssection of a perpetual and regular production and this capitalthat is these inter mediary productswhich he measures is the intermediary products employed at a given moment In this way his reasoning is just We have seen the fact that in a regular production the quantity of the intermediary products employed at a given moment corresponds to the capital in the sense which I have given that wordemployed in any period which one may care to consider If then the relation of the capital employed in a period to the pro ductive expenses of the same period gives us the average duration of the production the relation of the interme diary products employed at a given moment with the productive expenses of a period will also give us that dura tion But if we leave the special hypothesis which B6hm Bawerk has assumed if we cease to measure the inter mediary products at a given moment his thesis on the relation between the capitalistic degree of production to the duration of the production in the manner in which he defines capital will cease to be just BdhmBawerk in short defines capital without letting the notion of duration enter into his definition after which he tries to establish a certain relation between the notion of capital employed in production and that of the duration of production But this undertaking is vain The rela tion in question will not be verifiedat least in a universal mannerunless one has introduced the notion of duration into the very definition of capital I One may find something analogous to what BohmBawerk saysanalogous but not identicalin Marx See Le Capital liv ii  chap 15586 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS 3 The Productivity of Capital We come at last after long preparation to the question which I purposed to treat This question it must be remembered is that of the variations which take place in the product obtained for each unit of expense when the relative size of the capital varies It is that in other words of the manner in which the product varies when the duration of the productive process is lengthened B6hmBawerk is the first who fixed his attention I on this question Let us see then how he solves it In B6hmBawerks opinion when in production one uses roundabout methods which do not give immedi ately the product that one wishes to have one has if these methods are well chosen more products for each unit of expense And the longer one consents to await the product the more product one will have per unit of ex pense With the lengthening of the productive process if one chooses the productive methods well the prod uct per unit of expense will increase indefinitely altho it must increase less and less quickly4 If a month of 1 I leave out of consideration in the estimate of expenses that expense which is represented by the use of capital as such 2 We already find however a hint in Jevons Every new machine or other great invention writes Jevons Theory of Political Economy chap 7 General Expression for the Rate of Interest 1st ed p 238 will usually require the fixation of capital for a certain average time and may be capable of paying interest upon it but when this average time is reached it fails to afford a return for more prolonged investments This hint of Jevons which he gives incidentally does not agree as will be seen with what BdhmBawerk teaches Jevons also writes in the same passage pp 236237 Let the time the time elapsing between the expenditure of labor and the enjoyment of the result be t and the produce for the same amount of labor t which may be supposed always to increase with t But here Jevons is examining a certain problem and the always which contradicts the thought of the passage quoted above seems to represent only an editorial error a Positive Theorie pp 18 86 I ii II 1 Einige Fragen p 3

gives at once 100 units product with productive processes necessitating awaiting of one two three four five six seven years we shall have respec tively 200 280 350 400 440 475 500 units 1 If it were decided to adopt productive processes of a duration of eighteen centuries we should obtain products high as mountains 2 This view of B6hmBawerks has been criticized But more than once it has been criticized without being well understood3 I intend to mention here only the observa tions of those authors who have grasped BdhmBawerks thought Bortkiewicz declares that for reasons of a physical order the lengthening of the productive process must have a limit He seems however to hesitate about the point whether the series 100 200 280 350 400 440 470 500 should be followed by zeros or if it should be continued by repeating the number 5004 Bleicher affirms that lengthening the productive proc ess the product will not increase indefinitely that there is a point where this product obtains its maximum and after which it will diminish5 And such is also the opin ion of Fisher The latter begins by declaring that there is no objection to be made to the proposition of Bbhm Bawerk that the product increases with the duration of the production6 But he shows us soon afterward that he does not admit here an indefinite increase of the prod I Positive Theorie p 276 2 Bergehoch Ibid 277 3 See

product will diminish Let us see now what reasons BbhmBawerk gives us to justify his thesis what arguments he uses B6hmBawerk represents somewhere2 that each new detour that is decided upon in a production implies re course to a supplementary auxiliary force which would increase the productivity of the labor The more de tours we make then the more product we shall obtain But there is nothing convincing in this BdhmBawerk has warned us himself 3 that the duration of the produc tive process does not depend upon the number of detours of production And even if the number of detours and the duration of the productive process should correspond one cannot see why the product should necessarily and indefinitely increase relatively to the productive expenses with the multiplication of the auxiliary forces employed Again BdhmBawerk represents that if in society the quantity of capital which each laborer employs could be increased the production per laborer would be aug mented5 But it is not a question of knowing whether employing more past labor the present laborer will pro duce more It is a question of knowing whether the present laborer employing more past labor the product will increase relatively to the unit of labor expended that is to say of labor both past and present Better still it is a question of knowing whether the product will in I Ibid pp 6667 6869 I may be permitted to quote myself after the authors above mentioned and to refer to my Int6ret du capital paragraphs 98 136137 and to my Manuel d6conomique paragraph 92 In these works how ever I had not got to the point of making a finished study of the question which occupies us here 2 Enige Fragen pp 1011 i 2 3 Positive Theorie p 96 4 In truth the passage from BohmBawerk which I have just quoted tends less to demonstrate the thesis which is occupying us than to render it probable 5 Einige Fragen p 11 In the article The Positive Theory of Capital and its Critics BohmBawerk considers no longer social production but a special branch of productionPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 589 crease in the relative manner which I have just indicated indefinitely And thus the argument of B6hmBawerk loses its force What is left then to support BdhmBawerks thesis A certain number of examples with which he illustrates it There is the example of the man who needs water from a spring distant from his home and who instead of going to drink at the spring each time he is thirsty makes himself a bucket then arranges a pipe system there is the example of the man who after having fished with a line manufactures a net and constructs a boat that of the man who wants to lay in a stock of wood and who instead of breaking branches with his hands decides first to manufacture an axe etc These few ex amples according to BMhmBawerk suffice to establish the universality of the thesis which he sustains They are typical examples2 each of which represents an indefi nite quantity of similar or analogous cases and thus any one who will consider them attentively is to be persuaded of the truth of BdhmBawerks thesis Take an article the production of which is already highly capitalistic and can be decomposed into a large number of stages There will not be one of these stages in which the capital istic character of the production cannot be accentuated in a technically advantageous manner by the introduction of some new machine by the introduction of more elab orate and more durable instruments etc3 So reasons BdhmBawerk For my part I do not see that these examples which he gives us or suggests to us prove the universality of his thesis The universal propo sition which might be proved by typical examples is the following with greater advances I can increase in I These examples scattered through the Positive Theorie have been collected by BohmBawerk in Einige Fragen p 9 i 2 2 Einige Fragen p 10 3 Ibid pp 3940 i 8590 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS definitely the absolute quantity of the product but this proposition is quite different from that of B6hmBawerk BbhmBawerks proposition is that with a greater rela tive quantity of capital one can always obtain a greater number of products for each unit of expense Let us consider a complete productive process By replacing in one of the stages of this process manual labor by a machine by replacing certain machines by more elabo rate and durable machines and this in such a way that our productive process employs more capital I shall always be able to have more products But shall I always be able to have more products by increasing the relative size of the capital in other words by lengthening the duration of the productive process Nothing so far assures me of it And even if it were so it would still be necessary to prove that being able to increase the absolute quantity of the product by the lengthening of the productive process I can at the same time increase the product obtained per unit of expense In short what it is a question of proving is that if x land and labor with y capital gives P product then x land and labor with ay capital gives P product or more than p Now BohmBawerks examples show us that if x land and labor with y capital gives P product then adx land and labor with ay capital gives P product a in this formula being possibly greater than P and p greater also than a BbhmBawerk has failed to prove his thesis What are we to think of it We must consider it false AcPRODUCTIVITY OF CAPITAL 591 cording to BohmBawerk the same quantity of expense if the productive process is lengthened will give indefi nitely increasing products but products which in truth would increase less and less quickly In reality the product per unit of expense will increase at first to de crease afterward According to BohmBawerk 100 units of expense according as one adopts productive processes of a duration of 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 units of time will give 200 280 350 400 440 475 500 units of product In reality they will give a series something like 200 280 350 240 160 80 40 units of product All the examples furnished by reality it seems to me prove that this is the case Here is a forest being planted Supposing that you wait to cut the trees a longer or shorter period of time The quantity of wood we shall have will keep increasing at first and remain stationary afterward Thus if there were no other expenses than that of planting and that of cutting we should have for the return of these expenses a curve which would rise at first with the lengthening of the waiting and would then change to a horizontal If we take into consideration that expense which is rep resented by the value of the use of the land during the time which the wood is allowed to grow our curve will then have after an ascending branch a descending branch I intend to cultivate a piece of land I am going to increase my expenses of cultivation indefinitely and in such a way that the duration of the waiting always in creases Will the product per unit of expense increase indefinitely Not at all A time will come even when the supplementary expenses which I shall undertake will no longer increase the product by a quantity equal to their amount I have a manufacturing enterprise I increase the capitalistic character of it by introducing new machines by replacing the buildings and machines592 QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS in use by solider and better constructed buildings and machines If I continue in this course I shall arrive after a certain time at expenses the value of which will not be recovered in the product In short if we grant that x land and labor with y capital gives p product then increasing the relative quantity of the capital it may happen that x land and labor with ay capital will give p prod uct or more than p But for a certain relative size of y it will happen that x land and labor with ay capital will give p prod uct or less than p From what I have established regarding the productivity of capital there is more than one consequence to be drawn One might draw from it for example an argu ment against the role which BbhmBawerk attributes to the productivity of capital in the formation of interest if the views of B6hmBawerk on this question did not already in other ways invite criticisms which to my mind are decisive1 And here is another consequence If the accentuation of the capitalistic character of pro duction is bound to have the effect beginning at a certain point of diminishing the product obtained per unit of advances then we shall doubtless have to conceive the increase of the relative quantity of capital as bound to tend towards lowering the rate of interest sooner than it would if the scheme of the productivity of capital which B6hmBawerk gives us were exact ADOLPHE LANDRY PARIS ICOLE DES

gipsy moth and the browntailed moth from Europe into the United States and gave an ac count of an automobile journey through Brittany and Normandy in the summer of 1909 on which he was accompanied by M Oberthuir and by Paul Marchal of the Station Entomologique de Paris In the second paper he described a journey from Budapest through Lemburg to Kiew in 1907 the establishment of an experimental station at Kiew under the direction of Professor Waldemar Pospie low of the University of Kiew of the journey thence to Sebastopol Bachtisserai and Simferopol of the regional museum at the latter

Agricole Becent Additions to the List of North American Birds H C OBERHOLSER Dr Oberholser said that the period from 1910 to 1916 inclusive was one of great ornithological ac tivity During this period fully 125 species and subspecies were added to the list of birds known from North America Most of these additions re sulted from the description of new subspecies or the revival of hitherto unrecognized forms which together amount to over 100 among the most in teresting being five new subspecies from New foundland Two distinct species were described from North America during this time ZEstrelata cahow from the Bermuda Islands and a remarkable new gull allied to Larus californicus called Larus thayeri from Ellesmere Land Also a number of extra limital forms were for the first time detected within our boundaries among the most notable of which might be mentioned Puffinus carneipes taken in California Totanus totanus from Greenland Calliope calliope capmtschatkensis and Hypocentor rusticus both from Kiska Island Alaska Nyroca ferina Marila fuligula Clangula clangula clan gula Cryptoglaux funerea funerea Coccothaustes coccothaustes japonicus and Fringilla montifrin gilla all from the Pribilof Islands Pcecilonetta bahamensis from Florida Petrochelidon fulva pal lida from Texas and Tyrannus melancholocus satrapa from Maine The Fossil Seacow of Maryland WM PALMER Mr Palmer exhibited the fifth thoracic neural arch of a sirenian which was shown to be unlike that of the manatee and to agree absolutely ex cept in size with a similar bone of Stellers sea cow Hydrodamalis from Bering Sea The speci men was found freshly fallen under a cliff of the Calvert Miocene on the western shore of Mary land It was suggested that the species was liv ing during the period following the first erosion of the Cretaceous and the deposition of the Eocene as all the specimens so far found in the Miocene were clearly redeposits from an earlier age M W LYON JR Recording

j100011,Biological Bulletin,1536445,A Process of Temporary Chain Formation by Frontonia,i268352,A PROCESS OF TEMPORARY CHAIN FORMATION BY FRONTONIA1 WALDO SHUMWAY In May of this year while studying the protozoan fauna of a small pond in the New York Botanical Gardens the writer observed what appeared to be a chain of four holophryalike ciliates A careful search of the culture made during the fol lowing two weeks revealed about a dozen more such chains before the species disappeared During this time the writer attempted to obtain a pure culture of these interesting forms with an idea to studying the nuclear changes involved Although these attempts were all ultimately unsuccessful it has seemed best to put on record what few facts have been observed The data here given has been obtained from the study of the living material and some few preparations both in toto and sectioned The following stages in the formation of these chains have been observed single individuals twocell chains and fourcell chains No chains of three or more than four cells have been observed among the large number over one hundred and fifty observed The solitary individual is an exceedingly large circa 300 micra ovoid holotrichous ciliate densely pigmented and filled with large alveoli of some alloplasmic substance which stains deeply with nuclear dyes The color is dark brown to black with transmitted light and light brown to white with reflected light The mouth is anterior and lateral with rows of cilia which simulate two undulating membranes There is a large lateral contracting vacuole The cortical layer contains trichocysts The macronucleus is large and oval the micronuclei have not been observed in my material The form is an active swimmer in the surface film of a large culture but when isolated in Syra cuse watch glasses sinks to the bottom and encysts Details of this process are given below In cases where the individual neither dies nor encysts after From the Zoological Laboratory Columbia University 258CHAIN FORMATION BY FRONTONIA isolation it becomes transformed by clearing of the pigment lengthening and flattening the general shape of the body until it resembles the wellknown species Frontonia leucas To this species therefore I have assigned my material although I am not positive whether what I have observed is a new stage in the lifecycle of Frontonia leucas or a new species The process of chain formation is inaugurated by the formation of a large transparent cyst through the exudation of some gelati nous material in which the surrounding zo6gloea becomes en tangled in large quantities Within this cyst the individual slowly rotates all the cilia beating and the contractile vacuole pulsating regularly In one individual followed under the mic roscope a single transverse division occured about fortyfive minutes after the beginning of encystment and half an hour from its completion Nine hours after the daughter cells were dead still connected and inside the cyst wall FIG I Chain of four cells Frontonia leucas 200 X Outline drawn with camera from preparation fixed with sublimateacetic and stained with picro carmine Details restored from freehand drawings of living material Another encysted individual which had been isolated at the same time but which unfortunately had not been followed under the microscope had formed a chain of four cells The writer has at different times observed in these cysts single double and quadruple forms as well as cysts containing two or four separate cells One chain of four individuals was removed from its cyst for observation it swam about for a time resembling an animated chain of beads but finally broke up into its four 259WALDO SHUMWAY constituent parts which shortly assumed the typical Fron tonia leucas appearance While the writer has not actually observed the process of transformation from the twocell to the fourcell stage assumed above he feels convinced from the facts cited as well as from sectioned material in which the macronuclei of the two anterior and the two posterior cells seem to have just undergone division that these chains are formed by two successive transverse divis sions without separation of the daughter cells and not by a single quadrupartite or by three successive terminal divisions as might be argued from a priori grounds Division preceded by encystment is not unknown among the freeswimming ciliates In Otostoma carteri and Amphilep tus meleagris according to SavilleKent the divisions are some times multiple but the daughter cells separate immediately after each division Chain formation too is not unknown among the ciliates although heretofore it has been observed only among the asto matous forms parasitic in the digestive tracts of vertebrates In these parasites however the chains are often of great length and are formed so the weight of evidence appears by a process of terminal budding For an excellent discussion of these forms see Cepede I9I0 Jennings o8 records a strain of Paramcecia appearing in his cultures which had apparently lost the power of separation after division The general appearance and weak vitality of these forms however point to the conclusion that Jennings was dealing with a weakened pathological race and not a genetic mutation The frequency with which these chains appeared nearly ten per cent of all the Frontonia observed leads the writer to conclude that the phenomena described in this paper form part of a normal method of reproduction I have made attempts to raise these forms on hay infusion rotten lettuce infusion recommended by Popoff o8 thyroid extract and the filtered water of the medium in which they were discovered All were unsuccessful I have been unable to maintain isolated individuals in Syracuse glasses of their 260CHAIN FORMATION BY FRONTONIA 261 normal medium longer than two days For this reason I am unable to give a fuller account of the process under discussion nor carry out the experimental work suggested by it The case however appears to be a unique instance of normal temporary chain formation among the freeliving ciliates LITERATURE CITED

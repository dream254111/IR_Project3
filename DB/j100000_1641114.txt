CHEMICAL STUDIES OF THE BLOOD WITH AN APPEAL FOR MORE EXTENDED CHEMICAL TRAIN ING FOR THE BIOLOGICAL AND MEDICAL INVESTIGATOR1 BEFORE beginning my address let me say that I feel it to be a very great honor to have been asked to deliver the first Mellon Lecture under the auspices of the Society for Biological Research of this university The establishment of a lectureship of this character is a great encouragement to men of science It affords additional opportu nity to bring to the attention of a wider public the recent results of scientific inves tigation as well as to emphasize again a truth which can not be too often repeated that science constitutes a sure and lasting part of the intellectual treasure which man kind possesses2 I have ventured to take as the subject of my address some recent experimental and chemical studies of the blood In order to give my subject a proper setting I must first refer briefly to the history of blood letting and to make clear its relation to pressing medical problems I shall in the hour discuss the interaction of the blood and the organs of internal secretion The overwhelming significance of the blood to all people in all times is shown in folk sayings in tradition and in literature The expressions the life of flesh is in the blood tainted blood blood will tell blood oath blood brother all suggest how nearly blood has been held to be synon 1 The first Mellon lecture delivered in the As sembly Hall of the Mellon Institute Pittsburgh on February 27 1915 2 Ostwald  EN S VOL XLII No 1074 ymous with life It was an ancient Celtic custom to emphasize the inviolability of a treaty by having it written with the blood of both clans mixed in one vessel In the earlier systems of medicine as those of Asiatic countries of Egypt and of Greece alterations in the composition of the blood were held to be of great signif icance In Hippocratic medicine the right admixture of the four humors the blood phlegm yellow bile and black bile consti tuted health while wrong proportions or distribution caused disease This humoral theory of disease variously modified down to our own time has always fitted in well with the practise of bloodletting or ma king running issues and with other deple tory measures Bloodletting seems however to ante date all systems of medicine and to have been one of the earliest therapeutic proce dures applied by primitive races Leeches have been used for this purpose since the earliest times in Asiatic countries espe cially in India and let no one suppose that their use has been discontinued in our day Dr Shipley the master of Christs College Cambridge writing in the British Medical Journal3 tells us that the Allies and Ger mans are now fighting on some of the best leech areas of Europe and goes on to state that the traffic in leeches probably reached its height in the first half of the nineteenth century that for instance in the year 1832 57500000 of these annelids were imported into France 60000 to 80000 leeches a day frequently leaving Strassburg for Paris having been shipped overland from Hun gary via Vienna So great was the demand 3 No 2813 November 28 1914 p 917 and No 2814 December 5 1914 p 962 These papers con tain much valuable information concerning the medicinal leech as also the curious history of exotic leeches which in certain eastern countries constitute a serious menace to the life of men and animals that the artificial cultivation of leeches was taken up in various countries and be came a profitable industry And now a new use for leeches has arisen Certain glands surrounding the oral end of the di gestive canal of this annelid secrete a re markable substance which keeps blood from coagulating and which has been named hirudin This substance is much used in our laboratories to keep the blood of man and animals in the fluid state Leeches have thus become an article of commerce quite aside from their employment as deplet ing agents and the demand is constantly growing We are at present greatly ham pered by our inability to obtain them from Europe as their importation has practically ceased since the outbreak of the war It is not my purpose to attempt to give a history of bloodletting even in abstract the history of the subject is practically co extensive with the history of medicine it self I must therefore content myself with a few selections from historical writing which will demonstrate to you that the in fluence of this method of treating disease has been paramount since long before the time of Hippocrates whose writings furnish one of the earliest prescriptions for blood letting beginning with the direction to Bleed in the acute affections if the disease ap pears strong and the patients be in the vigor of life and if they have strength In the latter part of the twelfth century when universities as we now know them were coming into existence there originated in the School of Salernum the Regimen Sanitatis Salerni or Code of Health a poem written in Latin hexameter verses and giving the medical notions of the day as derived from the Arabic writers in re gard to bloodletting diet and personal hygiene The high value placed on the Regimen may be seen from the fact that it passed through some 240 different edi 136 SCIENCEJULY 30 1915 SCIENCE tions and was translated into all the known languages4 In general praise of blood letting the poem5 says Bleeding the body purges in disguise For it excites the nerves improves the eyes And mind and gives the bowels exercise Brings sleep clear thoughts and sadness drives away And hearing strength and voice augments each day Other verses give directions as to what months are proper and what improper for bleeding tells what diseases are benefited by bloodletting and in what quantities blood should be drawn and the effect of age and other circumstances Acute disease or only so in part Demands bloodletting freely from the start In middle age bleed largely without fear But treat old age like tender childhood here In the latter part of the middle ages bloodletting was carried to great excess During this period astrology strongly influ enced medical thought and physicians made diagnoses and bled their patients ac cording to the position of the planets con stellations and single stars horoscopic medicine For their greater convenience semipopular calendars were even prepared with illustrations such as the socalled venesection manikins of Johann Nider von Gemiind 1470 and of Stoeffler 1518 with directions as to the vein to be opened for the cure of each malady In the sixteenth and seventeenth cen turies we come upon heated controversies between the upholders of the Hippocratic and of the Arabian theories of bloodletting By the former method it was thought that the vein to be opened should be as near as possible to the diseased partin order that the foul and stagnant blood might be directly removed from the inflamed area 4 Garrison The History of Bloodletting N Y Med Jour March 1 and 8 1913 5 Professor John Ordronaux s translation derivation On the other hand the doctripe elaborated by the Arabians taught that blood should be taken from a vein re mote from the inflamed part for instance in inflammation of the lungs and pleura from the arm or even the foot of the oppo site side with the idea that this process revulsion prevented good blood from accumulating in the diseased part This latter doctrine was in the ascendancy in European countries in the sixteenth cen tury but the learned Pierre Brissot 1478 1522 basing his opinion on his own large clinical experience in Paris in 1514 when an acute affection of the lungs was prevalent revived the Hippocratic method of bleeding and thus started the famous Brissotvene section controversy in which most of the great men of the century including Vesa lius took part The importance attached to the controversy at the time is shown in the fact that the opponents of Brissot induced the French Parliament to forbid the prac tise of his method and their attacks were so bitter as virtually to drive him from Paris and his professorship Haeser6 in forms us that the quarrel assumed such violence that when the University of Sala manca took sides with Brissot the Emperor Charles V who was called on to render a decision in the matter was assured that the new false doctrine was no less danger ous than the heresy of Luther While Brissot was anything but a therapeutic nihilist as to breeding and held firmly to the doctrine that the foul blood of the inflamed area should be re moved some of his followers rejected bleed ing altogether in acute disease of the lungs and pleura the pleuritis of that day Their moderation was looked upon as little less than heretical and toward the end of the sixteenth century we find Leonardo Botallo a Piedmontese an eminent prac 6 Geschichte der Medicin II p 64 137N S VOL XLII No 1074 titioner of his time chief physician to Charles IX advising venesection to the limit regardless of the nature of disease the age or condition of the patient Blood lettings of three to four pounds each re peated as often as four or five times were advised says Haeser and this historian adds that the explanation of this Vam pyrismus is probably to be found in the circumstance that Botallo lived in northern Italy where diseases of an inflammatory character were prevalent and more espe cially that in his experience as an army sur geon he encountered only patients of the most robust type Botallo in defending his practise said the more foul water is drawn from a well the more good water can flow in to replace it7 An ardent follower of Botallo was Riolan the younger who falls back upon Hippoc rates and Galen and lays down the rule that one must take away as much blood as possible in every disease As an adult is judged to have about thirty  pounds of blood8 the tapping of half this amount or fifteen pounds in the course of fourteen days would be about the right amount to take says Riolan Guy Patin 16021672 himself an ardent bleeder and purger in forms us that Bovard body physician of Louis XIII bled that monarch fortyseven times gave him 312 clysters and prescribed emetics and purges 215 times all in one year A little later that able and credulous Belgian mystic and follower of Paracelsus J B Van Helmont 15781644 an icon oclast in general called by his admirer Haeser the fist of the seventeenth cen tury went so far as to condemn venesec tion entirely To him is attributed the 7 Bauer Geschichte der Aderlasse Gekronte Preisschrift Munich

alterantia and change of diet stands the genial and talented Franciscus de le Boe Sylvius 16141672 one of the leading medical authorities of the seventeenth century and one of the earliest defenders of Harveys doctrine of the circulation who taught at Leyden that abnormal fermentations in the fluids of the body cause disease a variant of the ancient humoral doctrine In Chap ter XX of his New Idea translated by Richard Gower London 1675 entitled On the Motion of Blood through the Lungs Affected he shows his good sense and his caution when he says A Plethora of Blood is soon and safely curd by a sufficient Emptying of it by opening a Vein whether it be together and at once or by repeted turns according to the peculiar nature and strength of the Sick For there are many who can not bear to have much taken away together but soon fall into a Swouning by which feeling none can at any time receive any good I had rather that it should be prevented as often as may be and every Cure be done securely rather than rashly seeing it often happens to those rash BloodLet ters that they educe Life together with Blood An instance of lavish bloodletting in a medical crisis may be found in the experi ence of that adventurous spirit Thomas Dover to whom we owe the much used Dovers powder In 1708 Dover then fortyeight years old set out on a privateer ing expedition and was given command of a ship the Duke while his superior Cap tain WoodesRogers took command of the other ship of the squadron the Duchess The three years voyage of these buccaneers is of interest historically because touching at the island of Juan Fernandez they took on board Alaxander Selkirk who had lived alone on the island for four years and four months and whose story was to develop in the skilful hands 138 SCIENCESCIENCE of Defoe into that of the immortal Robinson Crusoe  9 In Dovers Ancient Physicians Legacy to his country we find the following inter esting passages When I took by Storm the two Cities of Guaia quil under the Line in the South Seas it happen d that not long before the Plague had raged amongst them For our better Security therefore and keep ing our People together we lay in their churches and likewise brought thither the Plunder of the Cities   In a very few days after we got on board one of the Surgeons came to me to acquaint me that several of my men were taken after a violent Manner with that Langour of Spirits that they were not able to move I immediately went among them and to my great Surprise soon discerned what was the Matter In less than Fortyeight Hours we had in our several Ships one Hundred and eighty Men in this miserable condition I orderd the Surgeons to bleed them in both Arms and to go round to them all with Command to leave them bleeding till all were blooded and then come and tie them up in their Turns Thus they lay bleeding and fainting so long that I could not conceive they lost less than an hundred Ounces each Man If we had lost so great a Number of our People the poor Remains must infallibly have per ished We had on board Oil and Spirit of Vitriol suffi cient which I caused to be mixed with Water to the Acidity of a Lemon and made them drink very freely of it so that notwithstanding we had one hundred and eighty odd down in this most fatal Distemper yet we lost no more than seven or eight and even these owed their Deaths to the strong Liquors which their MessMates procured for them    Now if we had had Recourse to Alexipharmicks such as Venice Treacle Diascor dium Mithridate and suchlike goodfornothing Compositions or the most celebrated Gascoins Powder or Bezoar I make no Question at all con sidering the heat of the Climate but we had lost every Man Of nonmedical literature the Satire of Gil Bias written early in the eighteenth century but in reality giving a picture of 9 Chronicles of Pharmacy Wootton II p 130 seventeenthcentury excesses in blood letting is worth citing Dr Sangrado is called in to prescribe for a gouty old canon and he at once sends for a surgeon and orders him to take six good porringers of blood in order to supply the need of perspiration The surgeon was ordered to return in three hours and take as much more and to repeat the evacu ation the next day The patient was re duced to deaths door in less than two days and the notary being summoned to make the will seized his hat and cloak in a hurry when he learned from the messenger Gil Bias that Dr Sangrado was the physi cian Zooks cried he let us make haste for the doctor is so expeditious that he seldom gives the patient time to send for notaries that man has choused me out of a great many jobs But the misuse of bleeding continued in the centuries following and at no time was the practise more abused than in the latter part of the eighteenth or even in the first five decades of the past century French and Italian authorities especially were great believers in bloodletting Broussias 17721832 is said to have used 100000 leeches in his hospital wards in one year This physician and his follower Bouilland actuated by false theories of the cause of fevers recommended the bleeding of a pa tient 10 to 12 and even 20 times in the course of treatment But more and more the opponents of gen eral and excessive bleeding made headway in their respective countries Many are the names that might here be named as Pinel Andral Louis in France Dietl the pupil of Skoda and Wollstein the professor of veterinary medicine in Vienna Mezlar Rademacher von Pfeufer and others in Germany Marshall Halll and later Sir o10 While Marshall Hall favored Venesection he was one of the earlier and important members of 139 JULY 30 1915N S VOL XLII No 1074 William Jenner Sir William Gull Bennet and others in England Strambio Angelo Meli in Italy and Jackson in our own country and many others in all of these countries But what finally led to the entire aboli tion of bleeding after the middle of the past century was not so much the opposition of clinicians who failed by its use to abort pneumonia the queen of inflammations as Dietl calls it or some other acute dis ease but the rise of new theories of disease based on discoveries of fundamental impor tance The rise of the celltheory and of cellular pathology the discovery of bac teria and their connection with the inflam matory process of the infectious diseases the appearance of hydrotherapy the ex pectant medicine of the school of Skoda and Oppolzer new and quicker methods of ob taining the effects of drugs as by means of the hypodermic syringe the discovery of new hypnotics of the analgesics and anes thetics altered the views of medical theo rists and practitioners alike and inevitably led to the downfall of the theories on which venesection had been based During a period of study of six and a half years from 1884 to 1891 as a student of chemistry and medicine in several of the larger medical centers of Germany Austria and Switzerland I never once saw a patient bled in clinic or hospital The procedure may have been employed now and then but so little stress was laid upon it that it was not thought worth while to demonstrate it to the young men who walked the wards the profession to throw doubt upon indiscriminate bloodletting DArcy Power Dr Marshall Hall and the Decay of Bloodletting The Practi tioner 1909 Vol 32 p 320 11 See also F de Havilland Hall The Westmin ster Hospital Reports Vol XVII p 1 1911 who make the following statement in a clinical lecture on bloodletting To such an extent had bleeding been discarded that during my student days at St Bleeding did not disappear however from the world The common man espe cially in Germany and France still held firmly that benefits did follow the use of the wet cup the lancet and the leech Tena ciously the old practises were upheld If physicians refused to bleed there was al ways the barber surgeon fully competent as in teeth pulling to give relief I re member that in my boyhood in Ohio the practise of bloodletting in the spring of the year was in vogue among the farm laborers from southern Germany After their return from a visit to their barber surgeon in the town the scarified backs were exhibited as a special favor and irrefutable arguments advanced in respect to the bene fits of bleeding either to ward off disease or to improve nutrition Was it not true and known to all stockbreeders that the domestic animals could be fattened by judicious bleeding at certain fixed intervals  And it appears now that the common man was right after all An empirical method of treatment which has been prac tised by nearly all races since before the day of Hippocrates almost certainly con tains a basis of truth This is now admitted and physicians are again saving lives by the judicious and timely use of blood letting Says the experienced Sir T Lauder Brunton Bloodletting not only relieves symptoms but may save the patient s life as in engorged conditions of the right heart whether due to mitral incompetence or pulmonary affections12 Bartholomews Hospital I never heard of a patient being bled so that I was quite taken back when shortly after I was appointed House Surgeon at a country hospital the Senior Surgeon came to me to be bled Indeed in 1892 when I requested a mem ber of the Surgical Staff at St Bartholomews to bleed a patient for me he told me that this was the first time he had ever been called upon to per form phlebotomy 12 On the use of leeches in relieving overdisten sion of the right heart in cases of pneumonia see 140 SCIENCESCIENCE In puerperal eclampsia to mention but one more instance we also have a condition which is generally strikingly benefited by bloodletting13 Venesection then will probably never again be entirely excluded from medicine as it was during the last quarter of the past century nor need we fear that the practise will be again misused PLASMAPHERESIS But venesection like all therapeutic pro cedures has certain drawbacks which pre scribe limits to its use and these drawbacks are inherent in the very composition of the blood and in the nature of the circulatory apparatus As is known to all the oxygen carrying power of the blood resides in the red corpuscles or erythrocytes which con stitute about 36 per cent of the volume of the blood These erythrocytes like other cellular constituents can be built up only slowly in the body by the hemapoietic or bloodbuilding organs It is apparent therefore that the bad effects of overbleed ing as formerly practised must be due mainly to the loss of these cellular elements Common experience has shown that the loss of too much blood is either immediately fatal or else is followed by a prolonged ill ness recovery from which is often doubtful Reflecting on these drawbacks I con ceived the idea that the main objection of bloodletting could be obviated by the speedy return into the body of the red and the white corpuscles instead of throwing them away as hitherto has been our custom D B Lees Lancet February 25 1911 Also for cases in which bloodletting either by venesection or by means of leeches may be advantageously em ployed see F de Havilland Hall Westminster Hospital Reports Vol 17 p 1 1911 is See Zweifel Zur Behandlung der Eklamp sie Centralbl f Gynakologie 1895 No 46 Alexander Strubell Der Aderlass Eine Mono graphische Studie Berlin 1905 The only thing that would be removed from the blood of a person bled in this way would be its fluid partthe plasma If this method were found to be practicable the value of bleeding would be enhanced and its field of application extended Such a method if successful would appear to be advantageous for the patients not only in those instances in which venesection is per formed admittedly with good results but would also open the way for the withdrawal of fluid when it is desired to decrease the volume of blood in the vascular apparatus or to remove excess of deleterious sub stances or where bleeding has hitherto been contraindicated because of the danger of reducing the oxygencarrying capacity of the blood as for example in aneurism or in cardiac decompensation with a low blood count In the work now going on in my labo ratory we are still in the stage of experi mentation and study but our experiments on animals have proved the feasibility of the method With the skilful cooperation of my colleagues Drs Rowntree Turner Marshall and Lamson a considerable num ber of experiments on animals have already been made Our procedure in a word is the following Blood is withdrawn freely from an animal and is prevented from clotting by addition of leech extract Lockes fluid in equal volume is then added to the blood and the mixture is sedimented in the centrifugal machine until the cor puscles have settled out in the flasks The supernatant plasma is then drawn off and replaced by Lockes fluid the corpuscles are stirred up and the new mixture is re turned to the animal By repeating this process it has been learned that blood letting can be carried out repeatedly with out endangering the life of an animal provided only that the cellular elements of JULY 30 1915 141N S VOL XLII No 1074 the blood are returned We have named the procedure plasmapheresis It is apparent that when bloodletting is practised in the usual way there is always the risk of greatly reducing the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood through loss of red corpuscles but in our experiments the fluid of the blood can be withdrawn in large quantities without affecting this capacity as far as we can determine at the present moment Just how large quantities of plasma can be withdrawn without per manent injury can not at present be stated In certain cases very large amounts have been successfully removed in experiments extending over several days We have actu ally withdrawn from a dog by repeated bleedings in a single day a volume of blood more than twice that contained in the body with no apparent injury by our method of returning the corpuscles after each bleed ing How far this exceeds the quantity of blood that may be safely removed from a dog at one time without return of cor puscles is seen when we recall that the loss at one time of 60 to 70 per cent of the animals blood is quickly fatal It may yet be possible to attach an elec trically controlled centrifugalizing appa ratus directly to the blood vessels of an animal and tap off a desired quantity of the fluid part of the blood while directing the stream of corpuscles back into the body for vice versa the whole apparatus being analogous in a way to the modern cream separator It has been our purpose in our recent ex periments to find the limits to which the plasmapheresis may be carried and to learn what pathological changes ensue when the procedure is carried to a point beyond which life is endangered With the form of Lockes solution now employed by us we have in the course of five days carried the removal of plasma to a point where the total volume of blood withdrawn from the body equals at least five times that ordi narily contained in the body In this ex periment the limit of the procedure was probably reached as the animal was very nearly lost during the last bleeding only the speedy return of the sedimented cor puscles saved the dying animal Unfortu nately one can not conclude from these most successful experiments that similar or even markedly lower quantities can always be removed without danger We have re cently carried out a large number of ex periments with a view to determine the safe limits of plasmapheresis both as to quan tity per day and total quantity of blood withdrawn but unfortunately these experi ments are vitiated by an error which has only recently been discovered It has been found that the imported hirudin which we are now using is strongly toxic This was not the case with the product which we ourselves manufactured and which was used in our earlier experiments Further experiments will have to be done therefore to settle this question Some interesting results have been ob tained by studying the chemical changes during plasmapheresis Since the method consists essentially in replacing the plasma of the blood by a saline solution it is nat ural to find a decrease in the soluble pro teins of the blood While not as rapid as a purely mathematical calculation based on the amounts drawn off and returned would indicate if the vascular system were re garded as a vessel of given capacity to be washed out the decrease is considerable In three days the soluble proteins have been reduced to about one third their original value after which there is a slight rise as the process is continued Evidently as was expected there is a continual renewal of plasma proteins from the tissues In striking contrast to this the non 142 SCIENCEJULY 30 1915 SCIENCE proteid nitrogen of the plasma shows a slight rise on the first day in every case studied and a tendency to rise with some fluctuations as the process is continued This increase which is chiefly due to urea may be due either to an increase in nitro TABLE I Plasmapheresis on Three

have also been made of blood pressure and blood counts Plasmapheresis like hemorrhage causes a seemingly para doxical increase in the number of red cells per unit volume of blood This which ap pears to be a general phenomenon accom panying temporary asphyxia is being in vestigated in all its bearings by Dr Lamson14 The blood pressure which falls on bleeding is restored to a satisfactory value on returning the corpuscles and for a long period the two changes may nearly compensate each other A slight downward tendency is noticed however as plasma pheresis is continued and in the end a dangerously low point about 50 mm will be reached on withdrawing amounts of blood considerably smaller than those taken at the start The previous bleeding usually shows a fall to a point from 60 to 80 mm which should be regarded as a warning even though 100 mm or more may be reached on reinjection The following tables give in condensed form some of the data to which reference has been made in the

substances which nevertheless are certainly known to pass from one organ to others via the blood are all of the so called hormones the active principles of the organs of internal secretion Of these organs I shall presently speak more in de tail Our present methods of blood analysis give us little help when we endeavor to isolate and identify one of these elusive yet vitally important principles not to mention other substances of the greatest interest arising in the intermediary stages of metabolism Pondering over this problem it occurred to me that possibly one might construct an apparatus which could be attached to the blood vessels of a living animal and reJULY 30 1915 move from the blood flowing through it all traces of these substances as fast as they are poured into it without at the same time removing proteids or the indispensable cellular elements erythrocytes leucocytes etc of the blood Such an apparatus might conceivably be employed also in an emergency in certain toxic states in which the eliminating organs more especially the kidneys can not act rapidly enough to re lieve the system An apparatus of this kind was con structed with the skilful assistance of Dr Turner Essentially the method consists in connecting an artery or a vein of the animal by a cannula to an apparatus made of celloidin or other dialyzing mem brane in the form of tubes immersed in a saline solution or serum and providing for the return of the blood to the animals body by another cannula attached to a vein The tubes and cannulae are filled completely before attachment with a saline solution which approximates in composition to the salt content of the serum of the animal This is displaced into the body by the in flow of blood when the circulation in the apparatus is established The blood leav ing the artery flows through a perfectly closed system and returns to the body within a minute or two without having been exposed to contact with the air or any chance of microbial infection while the diffusible substances which it contains can pass out more or less rapidly through the walls of the tubes Coagulation of the blood is prevented by injection of hirudin We have named the process vividiffusion and the apparatus itself constitutes an artificial kidney as it were but differs from the natural organ in that it makes no distinction whatever between the various diffusible constituents of the blood per mitting their escape from the eelloidin tubes in a manner which is presumably propor tional to their coefficients of diffusion As you are well aware the natural kidney does not ordinarily allow the sugar of the blood to escape into the urine its excretory func tion is elective and discriminatory The artificial kidney as just stated makes no such distinction Sugar is eliminated in proportion to its presence in the blood equally with a waste product like urea We have it in our power however to give to this vividiffusion apparatus a certain selective ability at least in the sense that we can prevent any given substances as sugar glycocoll and the like from escap ing from the blood by the simple expedient of placing an equivalent quantity on the outer side of the celloidin tubes With this apparatus we have already separated from the blood a number of con stituents which can not be obtained with equal ease by other methods I shall not here enter into the details of the chemical methods employed in differentiating the various constituents of the dialysate but will merely point out some of the results that we have obtainedls It has been found 1 That the nonprotein constituents of the blood can be accumulated in any de sired quantity by our method the quantity depending on the extent of the dialyzing surface of our apparatus and the number of experiments made 2 That the rate of accumulation of vari ous nitrogenous substances in the dialysate and their relative proportions in it do not differ very greatly from those in the blood 3 That alanine and valine can be ob tained in crystalline form that histidine and creatinine can be shown by reactions to be present 4 Quite recently it has been found by e1 See Jour of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics Vol V pp 275317 and 62544 SCIENCE 145N S VoL XLII No 1074 Dr Alice Rohde working in my laboratory that the ammoniayielding substances of the blood can be divided into two classes by the vividiffusion apparatus the one com prised of diffusible substances only and giving off their ammonia rapidly and com pletely on the addition of sodium carbon ate the other nondiffusible and therefore not escaping through our apparatus and characterized by the property of losing their ammonia only very slowly on the addition of sodium carbonate 5 By means of our method of vividiffu sion we have also found that oxyacids cir culate in the blood in noticeable propor tion Lactic acid and ftoxybutyric acid in particular have been identified as constitu ents of the diffusate 6 From the residue from one of the processes employed that known as the ester distillation I obtained a crystal line substance having the composition C7H12N202 Dr Turner and I were finally enabled to identify this substance as aisobutyl hydantoin 1 isobutyl 24 diketo tetrahydroimidazol first prepared by Pinner and Lifschiitz17 and later by Fritz Lippichs from valeraldehydecyanhydrin and urea also by E Koenigs and B Mylo19 from dlleucinamid and ethylchlorcarbonate I suspect that other hydantoins are present in the fraction from which this particular hydantoin was isolated As aisobutyl hydantoin is the first of its class to be iso lated from an animal fluid or tissue one must be certain that the substance has not been formed as a byproduct of the many chemical processes that are involved in ob taining it in other words one is obliged to prove conclusively that the substance in question really exists as such in the blood of the dog For the present we can not 17 Ber d d chem Ges 20 p 2356 1887 8 Ibid 41 p 2972 1908 19 Ibid 41 p 4439 1908 offer this final proof Dr Turner how ever is now engaged in searching for hydantoins in the blood of the pig by a method that will remove the uncertainty that still attaches to the find as it now stands 7 Certain fractions of our dialysates those derived from the socalled phospho tungstic precipitate have not yet been analyzed in detail owing to the pressure of other parts of the problem it is apparent however that we are dealing with an inde terminate number of substances and it is more than probable that some hitherto un identified constituents of the blood may here be found Half a year after we made our first com munication20 in which it was announced that we had separated from our dialysates several grams of aminoacid esters Abder halden21 published a paper in which he de scribes the separation of some of the amino acids from large quantities of blood ob tained from slaughterhouses To secure the small amounts of amino acids needed for his identification tests this investigator was obliged to use at one time 50 or even 100 liters of beef blood These large quan tities of blood were worked up partly by dialysis partly by precipitation methods which required the dilution of the blood by many volumes of water The method of vividiffusion can be used in the most scantily equipped laboratory and has the great advantage of separating the diffusible substances from the proteids of the circu lating blood of living animals There can thus be no question here of secondary o20 On the Removal of

application of the method of vividiffusion one to which I al luded a few moments ago namely its pos sible employment to abstract from the cir culating blood certain hormones or products of internal secretion in amounts that will suffice for pharmacological study if not for chemical analysis This application is still in its very beginning many difficulties yet remain to be surmounted and I speak of it here only because it leads me quite nat urally to a field of study which is of the greatest importance a field which at pres ent is ripe for the methods of the chemical explorer I refer to the exploration of the organs of internal secretion especially to the study by chemical methods of their specific products In attempting this a vividiffusion apparatus of the proper sort is attached to the veins of a particular organ as the thyroid gland and the diffu sate thus obtained is studied by pharmaco logical and chemical methods This dif fusate must also be compared in respect to its pharmacological properties at least with both the arterial and the venous blood of the gland under investigation But what ever may be the outcome of such studies I hope to make it evident to you in what I am about to say that we are here dealing with matters of the greatest importance to biology and medicine JOHN J ABEL THE JOHNS HOPKINS MEDICAL SCHOOL To be continued THE RECENT ACTIVITY OF KILAUEA AND MAUNA LOA HAWAII THE volcanoes of Kilauea and Mauna Loa were both active during the past winter fur nishing the rather unusual spectacle of lava lakes within 22 miles of each other but at a difference in altitude of practically 10000 feet The activity of Mauna Loa as observed from Kilauea lasted fortyeight days from 147 November 25 1914 until January 11 1915 At Kilauea the first permanent open pool of magma was formed on October 3 1914 and this pool increased in size and rose until a maximum height of 363 feet below the rim of the crater Halemaumau was reached on Jan uary 4 1915 Since that time the lake has been slowly subsiding with temporary rises and pauses The activity of both volcanoes will be treated in some detail The lava lake in Halemaumau the crater of Kilauea was visible from the autumn of 1907 which was six months after the cessation of activity on Mauna Loa until the last of April 1913 The maximum height reached during this long interval was 60 feet below the rim of the crater on January 1 1912 During the au tumn of 1912 the level of the lake was low followed by a rise from November 1912 until January 1913 During January the lake sank in February it was at about the same level as in the beginning of March 1915 in March it sank almost out of sight after a brief rise on March 10 in April the lake was very low and very small and finally went out During the summer of 1913 Halemaumau was an immense flat funnel of slide rock with the base at a depth of over 600 feet The bot tom of the pit was seldom seen on account of the dense fumes Just before the time of the summer solstice which reached a culmination on June 22 blowing noises were heard and a faint glow seen in the pit indicating a slight rise of the lava In the middle of July the blowing noises recommenced and visible fire returned on July 23 An inner ring of fum ing cones and a glowing chimney near the site of Old Faithful were seen Once more the signs of activity ceased the blowing noises did not recommence until the first of September and a glowing cone near Old Faithful became visible September 24 The glow and the noises 1 Weekly bulletins concerning the activity of the

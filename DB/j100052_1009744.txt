American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia gave Thomas Gilpin Esq permission to read a printed paper entitled On the Representation of Minor ities of Electors to Act with the Majority in Elected Assem blies t The paper had been printed by the author at his own expense and dedicated to the society The date at the end of the paper is May i 1844 in the dedication May 3 I844 Two copies of the pamphlet are in the Philadelphia Library one is reported to be in the Harvard College Library one in the Franklin Institute Library in Phila delphia and one in the Library of the Boston Athenaeum It is a small pamphlet of fifteen pages and was reprinted in the Penn Monthlzy in I872 4 This paper is remarkable as being one of the earliest sys tematic discussions of the plan now known as Minority or Proportional Representation The paper antedates Thomas Hares earliest essays on the subject of Minority Represen tation by thirteen years and that of James Garth Marshall by almost ten years The author wrote in a city the members of whose legis lative body called Councils were elected at the time on a general ticket by a majority of the votes The results had  Read before the Political Science Association of the Central States Indian apolis January I i896 t Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society Vol iv p 8i Philadel phia 1847  In answer to a request for information published in the Philadelphia Ledger of December 4 I895 as to where other copies might be found Mr James Mon aghan of the West Chester Pa bar replied that he had one copy in his private library No other copies than those mentioned have come to the attention of the writer 23362 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY been unsatisfactory It seemed to Gilpin that such a plan was based on two principles one of which was sound and the other unsound It is right that the majority shall gov ern but not right that the voice of the minority shall be unheard He therefore undertook to examine the question whether a legislative assembly can be so elected as to repre sent the respective interests of the community in deliberation and to allow to the majority that control in its decisions to which it is entitled The political evils from which the city of Philadelphia suffered at that time seem to have been the same as at presentbossism and the subordination of local to national issues The caucus comes in for severe criticism and one of the arguments the author advances for his system is that in his opinion it would prevent those hasty and unjust displacements from office which have taken place by granting to the successful party all the benefits of office so offensive to the sentiments and feelings of a large and independent part of the community desirous only of a steady just and impartial administration of government From which it would seem as if the spoils system had already become firmly established in Philadelphia by I840 or even earlier The system of election by a majority as distinct from plurality vote the author thinks was occasioning many evilsnot the least among them that of giving to a small third party an entirely disproportionate influence when the two great parties were nearly equal in numbers Thus he said the system of majority voting in Massachusetts had thrown an entirely undue power into the hands of the Aboli tionists who by giving their support first to one party and then to another could practically make their own terms and was thus forcing both the other parties to become radi cal on the slavery issues when otherwise neither of them would have been so Nor did he think that the plan of plurality voting just then adopted by Massachusetts as a remedy for this evil would help matterson the contrary 234PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION it would make them worse since it might give to a party absolutely in the minority the power of controlling the public policy of the community without consulting the other parties at all The plan proposed by the author was very simple Each party was to put up its candidates as usual a number equal to the whole number to be elected The voting was to go on in the usual way each voter having one vote for each of say twenty menthat was the number then in Coun cils After the election each party was to have a number of representatives assigned to it bearing the same ratio to twenty as its vote bore to the total vote The names standing first on the party list should be declared elected until the number assigned to the party should be exhausted It is practically the Free List System which has been adopted of late in portions of Switzerland There is no indication in the proceedings of the American Philosophical Society that the paper was discussed in that body either at the time or later nor is it very apparent from the history of the period what was the immediate occa sion which gave rise to the paper The subject of repre sentative reform was indeed much debated at the time The law of Congress requiring the States to be divided into singlemember districts had only just been passed after great excitement in Congress in answer to a demand for fairer representation and a chance for the minority It is quite possible that more detailed researches will show that these ideas were advanced by earlier writers during the discussions incident to this Act of Congress At present they seem in this form at any rate to have been original with Thomas Gilpin even if they had been advanced before by writers and thinkers in Europe which does not yet appear Hare does not mention having seen this pamphlet though the expressions quota and representative quota are here used much in the Hare sense J Francis Fisher of Philadelphia 235 6364 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY in his Degradation of our Representative System and its Reform claims to have worked out a plan similar to Hares before the latter had published anything upon the subject In such case he may have been indebted to Gil pin or at least to the discussion which Gilpin started for the fundamental thought but if so he forgot to give Gil pin credit for it Fisher was also a member of the Philo sophical Society and may have heard Gilpins paper He must have known of Kanes claim for Gilpin in the obituary notice of the latter read before the society February I7 18541 in which he said that Gilpin had proposed the first matured plan for minority representation which had gained public attention among us Indeed Fisher could hardly have escaped seeing the pamphlet itself as Gilpin doubtless sent copies to all his colleagues in the society Salem Dutcher in his Minority or Proportional Repre sentation speaks of it as the first essay on the subject of Minority Representation in English and states that only one copy was known to be in existence Thomas Gilpin the author of the paperwhich whether the first or not is certainly an early and cogent argument for the principle of fair play for the minoritieswas born in Philadelphia in I776 and died in the same city in I853 He was a successful paper manufacturer and has the credit of having introduced many improvements into that branch of industry in this country He came of Quaker stock His father Thomas Gilpin was banished from Philadelphia at the outbreak of the Revolution on account of supposed sympathy with England He had felt in his life the bitter ness of belonging to a minority which not only was unrepre sented but was not even allowed to speak on its own behalf His son whose thoughts may have been turned to the sub ject by the experience of his father gathered together a  Philadelphia I863 t Proceedings of American Philosophical Society Vol vi p 13 Philadelphia 1859 236PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION series of papers relating

course it was natural that he should develop his interest in scientific politics t The history of this pamphlet on Proportional Represen tation illustrates in a striking way how there is a time for everything and how everything must wait for its time Written at a period when there was a general demand for some kind of reform in our system of representation it undertook to show how by adopting a system of propor tional representation the general ticket and caucus system could be made to yield satisfactory results It failed to accomplish its immediate purpose and only now after fifty years is beginning to bear practical fruit The caucus system and the singlemember district system have not yielded the results hoped for Whether any scheme of pro portional or minority representation can do

method were destined to have a trial and in such an event Gilpins plan has much to recommend it The historical interest attaching to the paper has seemed to make it worth while to reprint it entire and accordingly it appears below EDMUND J JAMES University of Chicago On the Representation of Minorities of Electors to Act with the Majority in Elected Assemblies By Thomas Gilpin Philadelphia John C Clark Printer 60 Dock Street 1844 Owing to the difficulty of procuring impartial and useful legislation in the present mode of conducting the elections it becomes worthy of consideration whether there may not be a plan constituted for choosing representatives for the several legislative bodies differently from the present one so as to have a more equal and just relation to the condition of societyto preserve more truly the rights of the people to carry more strength and talent and a more efficient expres sion of public opinion into deliberative assemblies The present mode of choosing representatives by a majority of the votes of the electors has been so obviously before the people and it is so easy for the majority to con tinue it that it has been used in popular governments from their early origin and has remained without any attempt at improvement or even consideration It is true that it is based upon the just principle of the right of the majority to govern but in practical legislation it is connected with a very erroneous one that the voice of the majority alone is to be regarded Thus in making an election of representatives as it is now done in a district by the majority a large part of the people forming barely the minority is deprived of any interest or voice in the elected councils and there is no opportunity to bring into them any considerations but those respected by the majority 238PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION But if the deliberative assemblies were divested as they ought to be of the strong desire for political power and exclusive legislative action there would be a better estimate of the advantage of a representation to correspond to the general feeling and opinion of the people Let us therefore examine the question Whether there can be a legislative assembly elected so as to represent the respective interests of the community in its deliberations and to allow the control of the majority in its decisions to which it is entitled For the purpose of testing the proposition it will be necessary to advert to the operation of the present system in its forming some of the representative assemblies in the example of one or two particularly known to us but these are not referred to from any motive of adverse observation The usual results of the elections in the City of Phila delphia for its Councils or Corporation gave for several years but a bare majority of the electoral votes to elect the whole representation which was thus continued from year to year by one party and the operations of the Councils and City interest governed exclusively by it By the returns at the elections for several years previous to the last a very uniform state of voting at the polls con tinuedsay for the years 1840 1841 1842 In I841 the number of votes polled was 10304 and the votes were returned but of two parties who gave respectively 5545 votes and 4759 votesso that a change of 394 votes in that year from one party to the other would have displaced the whole representation of twenty members of the Corporation And it is also obvious that as the whole number was put in by the majority there was no representation for the minority which gave the votes of nearly onehalf the citizens These have no voice in the councils be their candidates ever so worthy and efficient and their interests ever so important And it would be illiberal to conclude that abstract political sentiment should constitute a disqualification to attend to 239 6768 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY their own and the public concerns in a legislative assembly Independently of this it is very evident that the influ ence derived from the possession of power and office tends to preserve it it is scarcely ever if ever voluntarily yielded to a just consideration of the equal rights of the community in consulting the general good feeling requisite for constituting a legislative assembly And it is evi dence of an arbitrary and not of a fair republican prin ciple for any party to retain the exclusive representation and responsibilities of the public weal because experience has abundantly shown that where this has been long con tinued either in republics or monarchies it involves them all in the same character and is the virtual source of oppression and injurythe cause of great discontentand when not subversive of the administration it is subversive of the harmony and confidence which ought to be afforded to it And it is the right of every interest to be represented asfar as possible There are many advantages to be derived from the introduction of opposing ideas if it is only to test the strength of correct or prevailing measures for it is certain that a delegation to represent the most important interests may be taken from all parties so as to balance the public mind draw forth its energies and substitute relative instead of arbitrary action so much the result of assemblies hold ing long and exclusive legislation It is a matter of general acknowledgment and even of record that had the voice of the opposition so frequently and respectfully offered but disregarded in the administra tion of our late financial concerns received attention from the persons then in power the catastrophe so universally spread over the country would have been greatly lessened and probably averted and as we should not be confident that other institutions are now free from a similar effect of exclusive action a cautious oversight should be given to regulate them 240PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION There is another evil growing out of the present system of electing representatives in this manner in opposition without having respect to the minorities in many places a third party is coming forward which though the minor one and without independent power is nevertheless important to both and being at hand to be solicited can give its num bers and influence to either holding a sway between them it is able in return to commute for its own interests beyond their merit A management of the kind among the parties now in the State of New York is producing this dilemma there although for want of exact information it cannot be further observed upon at present but in the State of Massachusetts it is exhibited more exactlyit is there that a third party now the advocate of abolition holds the balance so as to vacillate between the two political parties And in order to make this understood the case may be stated as it exists at least in its proportionate numbers to show in what way this effect is produced The larger party in one district may have a proportionate vote say of  ioooo electors and yet be deficient in a majority The opposing political party may vote   8ooo and the third party now for abolition    5ooo Making together an aggregate of  23000 Now it is evident that the measures of both the former may be under the management or even control of the third party In this manner partial legislation and ultra meas ures have been obtained by the urgency of the smaller body of the three which would not have been permitted in an independent organization of the electors and representa tives The Legislature of Massachusetts has sought to remedy this evil by providing that a plurality of voles shall be regarded as that of a majority but the event of this will be that the 241 6970 ANNALS OF THR AMERICAN ACADEMY plurality party though able to command a greater number of votes than either of the others but less than both will obtain the sway in the State and subject both the other parties to it It will therefore be evident that this proposed expedient will not redress the eviland how strangely will it operate The plurality votes of Ioooo electors will enable it in legis lation to have control over I3ooo because the plurality ticket being united will carry its majority over the divided tickets of the other voterswhich of course is subversive of the principles of republican representation Has there not been good reason to believe that in this way interests of high importance to society have been fre quently compromised during the contentions of the large political parties by alternate cessions to the various sub interests in return for their votes and influence to an extent and character detrimental to the future interests of society and which neither party would have conscientiously acceded to if invested with free and independent legislation  The question then offered is Does the case admit of a practical system for equal representation  The following one is presented for itIt is believed to be efficient and justly applicable to the present state of society It is founded upon the principle of Republican Government and equal representation and capable of bringing forward the latent good sense of the people now much withdrawn from public service owing to the overrule of political con tention and party management and that it will cause the elected body to be an exact representation of the public interests Let the number of representatives allotted to each district of a State be divided into the number of electors so that a quota may be established to allow a certain number of votes to choose a representative The number of votes thus assigned taken for all the delegates together will of course be the number of votes 242PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION found in the district for the quota for the election of each delegate may actually be determined upon when the votes are all handed in at the close of the election As every quota of votes may be united in by any interest and will entitle it to a representative so one or more quotas united according to the number of voters may choose one or more representatives for an interest independently of the others Should even general politics continue to be a paramount consideration as it has so long prevailed to be and the number of voters be so large as to command a sufficient number of quotas a majority in the elected body may con tinue to act even for political purposes but other quotas will be obtained by the minority to have an opportunity to represent their political or other views and different interests thus represented may advocate independently any important measures which require it In this way the selection of candidates may be made up without excitement and certainly without competition be cause they may be sent very much from separated parties having a union of interests so that each may promote its own candidate of course the equivalent considerations for introdticing partisans into general tickets will be at an end and with them all the small legislation of closet and club meeting politicians to make their nominations of represen tatives bound to a general understanding to uphold party interests and not at liberty to advocate measures indepen dently beyond them This plan would be eminently conservative of general representation it would produce steadiness of legislative action would prevent the sudden dismission of all the repre sentatives of a party from power at any one time by the con trivance of officious politicians who are able easily to turn the scale by misrepresentations when the parties are nearly equal and even when this occurs by a sudden change of the public mind the change cannot act disadvantageously on 243 7X72 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY legislation because there will always remain a sufficient number of the electors unchanged to return many of the most suitable delegates of the previous party to be mingled with those newly elected This plan will prevent very much those hasty and unjust displacements from office which have taken place by grant ing to the successful party all the benefits of office so offensive to the sentiments and feelings of a large and inde pendent part of the community desirous only of a steady just and impartial administration of government By this means the Legislature would be filled by delegates for special objects and renew its republican features by qualifications to take charge of the respective interests of the community with a better consciousness of service and responsibility than that of being sent as simple delegates or representatives of a political party for the term of one year more qualified to practice in the art than in the science of public economy and legislation Would not such an appropriation of suitable persons vastly improve our public assembliesr Would it not introduce individual responsibility and in telligence both into the several assemblages for the appoint ment of candidates and by the selection of men adapted to their appointments  Would it not induce respectable assemblages of persons now adverse to common political meetings but who would be willing to attend when the special interests of the country required it for business purposes and for objects which demanded legislative aid and representation Would it not in a measure reorganize the attentio of the community break up the caucuses of political societies to which the better part of the people are victims and the victims of the aspirants to offices who offer no choice to theml but of party candidates elected to sustainl themselves Might not the great interests of the country first be brought forward and understood and then persons selected 244PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION to attend to them in their several departments and these varied on occasions where particular objects required it Let us now review the course of some of the last elections for the City of Philadelphia in relation to the adaptation of this system and it will be found that had the plan been then carried into effect it would not have destroyed the majority of the present party although it is true it would not have so far gratified it as to allow it all the delegation yet the Councils would have been more just and of course more safe in all their operations if they had been guided by such a courtesy as to have united other interests with their own in conducting the public business For thus the Councils represented little more than a divided authority dependent upon an uncertain majority chiefly supported if not con trived out of previous patronage and incumbency of office The votes given at the city election 1841 were  I0304 and 20 representatives were elected If then 500 votes would be the assigned quota as the due proportion for a representative the aggregate would be for the 2  ioooo Dispensing with the residuary fraction of  304 the majority to elect gave 5545 votes which at 500 votes per delegate gave  I rep The minority which failed to elect gave 4759 votes which would have elected  9  Making the whole number of  20 rep and this would have left in favor of the ruling party a majority of two representatives which is as great as the general electoral vote would have given on the former mode or could be claimed for it on any public appeal As an act of justice such an arrangement is required to satisfy the public mind and it would amalgamate the better feelings of the community  245 7374 ANNALS OI THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Should any excitement be produced by disquietude of the people by accidental circumstances or by retaliation and a consequent change of City Councils ensue so that the opposite party alone gets into power the event will not be less to be deprecated than by having the present or any other partial or exclusive administration It is always unwise to afford exclusive power to any one party particularly as it regards its own character and re sponsibility the party out of power is accustomed to take advantage of every failure of the measures of those in power and many operations are often in progress the propriety of which at least in public judgment is decided by success be their nature and risk what they may but even this judgment may not be altogether so unreasonable when legislation is one of assumed and exclusive responsibility because the acts of any public body are much better deliberated upon and more judiciously determined when there is not the uniform disposition to urge business forward by the sanguine view often taken by persons accustomed to act together The following view may be taken of the result of this plan for presenting the minorities to act with the majority in the public body by showing its application to the last return of votes for corporators in the City Councils and the rules are given by which this plan may be adapted to govern similar elections After the tickets have been agreed upon on the part of the electors as usual and include the whole number of repre sentatives to be voted for they are to be handed in by them at the several wards to the judges and inspectors But the votes are to be assigned differently from the usual mode and the choice of representatives will be made from them as follows First A number of votes to form a representative quota for the choice of one member will have to be fixed upon this might be done by referring for a standard to the number of the votes given in the district at the last previous election 246PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION but it may be better to wait for the close of the pending election and then procure the number of votes polled at that time Second This number is to be divided by that of the number of representatives allotted for the district in order to fix upon the proportion of votes as a representative quota which each ticket must give to entitle it to choose a delegate Third Each electors ticket may contain as candidatesthe whole number of representatives to be voted for in the dis trict and these should be placed in preferences highest on the list in order that thosc first set on it may be chosen according as the number of votes given may entitle the ticket to one or more of its candidates Fourth The representatives are to be chosen by any elect ing interest whose votes amount to one or more representative quota and it is to have one or more representatives accord ingly Those who are highest in vote are to be first chosen and when the votes are equal then the preference is to be given to those who are highest named on its list of candi dates Fifth When the number of representatives is not made up by the votes in the representative quotas then the remainder is to be taken from the residuary numbers of the unsatisfied votes beginning with the highest number unsatisfied on each ticket and then in succession from which there is to be taken the candidate highest in vote on its ticket or if the votes are equal then the highest on the list Sixth If only one representative is to be chosen from a dis trict the election is in this case only to be made as it is now done by the majority In fixing primarily upon the representative quota it is not desirable to arrive at any particular exactness in the division of the whole number of votes among the representatives at least not to descend to the fractional parts of hundreds because less than these could not be entitled to a representa tive And when the multiple or whole number is determined 247 7576 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY upon it places all the representative quotas on the equal footing necessary for all useful purposes and they will have all the same claim upon the residuary votes Under the above rules we refer to a general result of the election of 1841 which would have been as follows In this statement the whole election returns are given but the division of the minority vote is of course suppositi tious The votes of the majority were   5545 of the minority  4759 10304 Thus twenty representatives allotted establishes a rep esentative quota of 500 votes to each delegate Majority interests represented potes  PoliticalpartyPoW lled 5545 5545 i Political party W   5545 5545 Interests which might be represented 2 Political party L F 3 Temperance interest  4

I Making the full number  20 248 tt  s A APROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION The representative is to be taken from the highest in vote or in place on the several tickets thus the party which does not obtain a member on its quota and ascends highest in the residuary vote obtains one when the quotas are supplied The reference in the foregoing statement has been made to the state of the election returns of the three years previous to the last because they were tolerably uniform and the result of the middle year was taken In the year I843 the votes were materially changed and suddenly gave a majority of 2448 for the highest political party this majority may be either accidental or permanent and it might have been produced on either side by some accidental or extra influ ence but in this view it is not intended to discuss the merit of any particular politics but only to allude to the cases in order to guard against partial representation and the injurious effect of sudden vacillations upon public affairs If the change is one of those liable to be produced by an easy influence of the public mind it ought to be guarded against by some change of system in taking the public votes and if it is more permanent it is still equally proper to arrange a method by which both sides should have a due representation of their opinions and measures It will be proper further to carry out this rule in order to show its application to the election returns of the votes and representatives of the City and County of Philadelphia in I843 and the manner in which a quota representation would then have given a majority of the Assembly members and have represented the same political interest County votes of the majority  6604 of the minority  3890 Total        0494 And as four representatives are allowed the quota repre sentation in this case to elect a representative will be 2500 leaving the residuary portion 494 249 7778 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Votes Residuary polled Delegates otes I Political party W   6604 2 1604 2 Political party L F  3890 i 1390 10494 But as the quota representation yields only 3 delegates one is to be taken from the highest residuary vote W 1604  i Making the full number   4 Which in this case returns Of the ist political party W  3 Representatives Of the 2d   L   i 4 Large political parties do not seem to be expedient for conducting the useful business of a country as their purposes become conventional and their action becomes merged in the support of place or power which should be prevented when there is sufficient identity of public interest independ ent of such considerations How little ought general or national politics to influence the internal police arrangements of a State or city its improvements or its finances Yet is it not made a medium for general acceptation to every office public services being a secondary consideration to subserviency in political measures  The majority power has for a long time ruled all the interest of the country and has been exercised with arbitrary inconsiderateness alternately by each party It can be corrected in no way so effectually as by throwing immedi ately before the public the objects which should claim its attention in order to produce an immediate connection between the people and their interests and this can only be effected by a representation independent of politics 250PROPORTIONAL REPRESENTATION By this plan however the rise of a political party to a certain extent is not altogether impossible and might be permitted if useful but it being easy thus to introduce into the legislative bodies other interests by minorities they will keep it in check by the independence of their election as they probably will by their intelligence Should even the Native American party now coming forward be found worthy of public support and get favor so as to be useful for a time its purity and efficiency will be much preserved by its not attaining to a predominant sway or at least by only arriving at it relatively to other interests Reference has been made to the election returns of the City of Philadelphia merely on account of its easy investi gation as it answers for an example of the deficiencies in representation these however exist in the same manner in all the elected bodies and they will so remain and be unsatis factory to the constituents until the interests of the minor ities become respected so that they may be represented and act with the majorities and it is believed the plan now offered when it becomes understood may be adopted to remedy the deficiency and it is referred for that purpose to the discretion and intelligence of those who acknowledge the serious evils of party contentions arising out of the right of the elective franchise That the alteration by this plan in making election returns would change the representations from various localities may be expected but it is to be expected that it will be generally to great advantage because it carries out a principle of exact representation and relief and as dele gates can be sent to represent every important interest it must give evidence of its own propriety and must eventu ally be acceptable The practice heretofore pursued of resting all predilec tions upon the title of a great political party has subjected the district divisions as well as the political parties to very pecudiar though they may be appropriate epithets many of 251 7980 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY them certainly not selected for their elegance and which clearly indicate considerable restiveness on the part of the people The advocates of particular measures or even of a favorite candidate will have at all times an opportunity to unite for a quota representative and by calling upon each elector to discriminate among the candidates to place at the head of his ticket the best man and thus bring forward an interest to be respected in the representative body this will require deliberate reflection on the choice to be made among the various objects of moral or civil benefit in order to give preference to those of the highest importance If this system be sound and practical as it is believed to be the further promotion of it is respectfully submitted At no period of republican history was there required more attention to the renewal of representative principles and the revival of representative purity In an enlightened age the extension of a great confederation of popular govern ments is in irresistible progress over an immense land now allied in the courtesy of great national feeling it becomes therefore necessary to preserve this and may it not be accomplished less by extreme authority than by rendering a just representation to the varied interests of an extended people

The Railroad Rate Discrimination Provision of the Merchant Marine Act 1920 By STUART DAGGETT PHD Dean College of Commerce University of California RECENT legislation relating to the United States merchant marine has raised questions relating to the regulation of railroad rates in the interest of American shipping which are of much immediate importance These questions are connected with the interpretation and administration of section 28 of the new shipping law Section 28 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 forbids rail carriers to quote export or import rates in connection with ocean vessels not documented under the laws of the United States which are lower than rates on like commodities moving similar distances over the same route in the same direc tion but remaining exclusively within the United States The law provides however in mitigation of the severe rule laid down in its opening sentences that the Interstate Commerce Com mission may suspend the operation of the act in the matter of export and im port rates when the United States Shipping Board certifies to it the lack at specified ports of an adequate supply of American vessels to handle the business offering The suspension is to continue until in the opinion of the Shipping Board the supply of Ameri can vessels has become adequate The first proposal for legislation of the character here summarized ap pears in section 30 of H R 10378 as reported to the Senate by Senator Jones of Washington in May 1920 Mr Dean general counsel for the Shipping Board says that this matter of discrimination in rates was brought to his attention in the middle of the year 1919 but that nothing was done at that time nor later until Admiral Benson became a member of the Board Indeed a representative of the Seattle Chamber of Commerce who called upon Senator Jones as late as March 1920 was told that al though some legislation with regard to export rates had been suggested there was nothing of the sort in the pending Merchant Marine bill and that the matter was dead The same informa tion was given to Mr H A Dunn of San Francisco When in March 1920 Admiral Benson became chairman of the Ship ping Board the situation changed The new chairman was earnestly in favor of developing an American merchant marine As a means to this end he promptly decided that any discrimination which might be granted by railroads to export traffic should be limited to traffic which made use of American ships To make his point of view effective Admiral Benson had an amendment prepared which he sent with a letter strongly urging its adoption to the Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce This was after the formal hearings on the Jones bill had been closed but while the bill was still in conference Mr Dean discussed the amendment with Senator Jones who thought well of it The proposal was adopted first by the subcommittee in charge of the bill then by the whole committee and still later it was passed by Congress itself as section 28 of the Merchant Marine Act of June 5 1920 Such is the history of this particular provision of the law The arguments in favor of section 28 are all based upon the assumption 196THE RAILROAD RATE DISCRIMINATION that the time has come when federal assistance should be extended to an American merchant marine Both Senator Jones and Admiral Benson have been outspoken on this point The supporters of the measure were doubtless originally influenced by the fact that the Government possessed some seven million tons of shipping which could neither be sold at an acceptable price nor be operated by the Government at a profit This tonnage had not been acquired for commercial reasons but it represented none the less a large investment on which it was desirable to earn a fair return The fundamental justifica tion for section 28 however in the eyes of its original promoters was un questionably their conviction that its effect would be to build up an Ameri can marine in private as well as in Government hands which would afford profitable employment for American capital and would advance the interests of American foreign trade In this re spect indeed section 28 was only one of a number of provisions in the new law looking toward the protection of American shipping Other sections in the Merchant Marine Act designed for the same purpose provided for the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to the Philippine Islands the repeal of the statute authorizing the admission of foreign built vessels to American registry and for the partial exemption of shipown ers from income and excess profits taxes for ten years on condition that they annually invest in ship construc tion an amount equal to the taxes which they would otherwise have paid to the Government OBJECTIONS TO SECTION 28 It is natural that objections to sec tion 28 should come from persons who oppose subsidy legislation as such Yet this section is also vigorously op posed by those who believe in strength ening the American merchant marine but declare that an attempt by the method here proposed will fail in its purpose or will succeed only after causing intolerable loss to certain geographical districts Because of the necessary brevity of this discussion we will consider only objections of the second type On May 28 1920 the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce wired a message to its representative in Washington declaring that the merchants in San Francisco were emphatic and unani mous in the belief that no restriction of any nature or kind in reference to the flag carried by the ship or in direct ref erence to rail import and export rates should be imposed The Chamber added in explanation that it felt that the operation of section 30 section 28 in the law as finally enacted would im mediately divert tonnage from the Pacific Coast to eastern seaports and would also provoke retaliatory meas ures by foreign countries This dis patch was followed by dispatches to other chambers of commerce in the Far West and by the issuance of a questionnaire in June which was cir culated among trading and transporta tion companies in San Francisco as well as among chambers of commerce north and south Other coast cities gave similar prompt consideration to the pending legislation The result of this preliminary dis cussion and of an active correspond ence which accompanied it was that it presently became the deliberate and official judgment of the merchants of San Francisco Seattle Tacoma Port land and San Diego that section 28 of the Merchant Marine Act would work to the injury of ports located upon the Pacific Coast in the following ways 197THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY 1 It would divert tonnage from western to eastern seaports 2 It would divert tonnage from Ameri can to foreign ports 3 It would provoke retaliatory legisla tion by foreign countries 4 As a consequence of the dislocation of trade which would follow a reduced ocean tonnage and retaliatory legislation abroad the application of section 28 would lead to a reduction in westbound freight ihove ments over the transcontinental railroad lines which in time would produce a scarc ity of cars for eastbound business and pos sibly would make necessary an increase in local railroad rates The Pacific Coast cities thus took in May and June 1920 the position of active critics of the new law Los Angeles it may be added did not join in this expression of opinion but stated the view that American business men would prove able to control the routing of their exports and that section 28 would have a desirable effect in en couraging American shipping I am inclined to doubt if the passage of the Jones bill will lead to damaging legislation on the part of foreign coun tries It is true that the bill has al ready provoked caustic comment in the English press The London Fairplay for instance terms the Merchant Marine Act and section 28 of that act in particular a direct attempt to drive other nations from the shipping busi ness of the United States and hints broadly that England will take cor responding action with respect to serv ices which that country controls It is clearly possible that some hostile legislation abroad will have to be en countered On the other hand the strong position of the United States in international trade and the fact that section 28 treats all foreign nations without distinction may be trusted to keep this reaction within bounds Neither China nor the west coast of South America possesses important merchant marines which will impel either of them to reprisals upon the commerce of the United States while countries which deal with the Atlantic seaboard of the United States at pres ent suffer no handicap there from the new law The principal marines to be affected in the near future are the Japanese and such of the English ves sels as ply upon the Pacific and opposition from these sources public opinion in the United States seems disposed to disregard RATE MAKING AND THE FAR WEST With respect to the probable diver sion of traffic from ports on the west ern seaboard however the Pacific Coast cities have made out a clear case at least under present conditions as to supply of ships To understand the situation one must remember that export and import rate making is of more practical significance to the Far West than to any other part of the country and that accordingly inter ference of any sort with export or with import rates has there a more far reaching effect In fact there are no export rates in force on movements from the interior of the United States to the Atlantic seaboard outside of the longstanding differentials to Boston Philadelphia and Baltimore and while export rates are quoted to the Gulf cities the differences between domestic and export rates are not so great on southern as on western hauls nor are the rail distances so great in the South as they are in the West A very good illustration of the im portance of western export rates may be found in the case of rates on iron and steel Before the recent increase in charges the rail rate from Pittsburgh to New York on iron and steel was 27 cents a hundred pounds the ocean rate from New York to the Orient was 89 cents per hundred pounds the com 198THE RAILROAD RATE DISCRIMINATION bined ocean and rail rate from Pitts burgh to the Orient was therefore 116 The domestic rate on iron and steel from Pittsburgh to Seattle was 137 or 21 cents in excess of the total charge from Pittsburgh to the Far East via New York In order to secure some portion of the Pittsburgh export business however carriers west of Pittsburgh quoted an export rate of 60 cents per hundred pounds which added to an ocean rate of 60 cents made a total of 120 per hundred pounds for the movement via the Pacific seaboard of the United States as against a rate of 116 via New York Under this adjustment Seattle was able to handle 2500000 worth of iron and steel bound for the Orient during the first three months of 1920 as against some 13000000 worth which traveled via New York It is perfectly evident however that except for the low export rate not a pound of export steel would have moved west from Pittsburgh The Portland Chamber of Commerce points out that what was probably in tended when the authors of the Jones bill forbade carriers to quote export or import rates in connection with vessels not documented under the laws of the United States was that operators of foreignowned vessels should be com pelled to absorb the difference between domestic rates which under section 28 would obtain on exports or imports moving in foreignowned vessels and preferential export rates which would continue to obtain on imports or ex ports moving in Americanowned ves sels so as to enable Americanowned vessels to compete advantageously with foreignowned vessels Foreign carriers can not however absorb a dif ferential when it amounts to more than the entire ocean rate and the result is likely to be if section 28 is actively enforced that foreignowned vessels will abandon Pacific ports in favor either of Canadian ports or of ports on the Atlantic If this occurs moreover it will be logical to expect diminished business for the transcontinental rail carriers and dislocation in the traffic and rates on these railroads ATTITUDE OF INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION Defenders of the policy of railroad discrimination in favor of goods carried in American vessels have taken the po sition that though the law when en forced might tend to produce certain undesirable diversions of tonnage such as the diversion of oriental freight from Seattle to Vancouver or from San Francisco to New York both the Shipping Board and the Interstate Commerce Commission will take posi tive action to prevent such diversion It is not clear what the Shipping Board will be able to do in such matters except to allocate vessels and possibly to modify ocean rates It is however plainly expected that the Interstate Commerce Commission will prevent oriental freight originating in the United States from leaving the conti nent via Canadian ports by refusing to allow American rail carriers to quote through or export rates on business so routed it is also expected that the Commission will be called upon to exercise its power of embargo to check the diversion of freight from American to foreign ports or from ports in the western United States to ports in the eastern section of the country This point of view is explicitly presented in a statement by Admiral Benson under date of July 2 1920 from which the following extract is taken The Interstate Commerce Commission is aware of the necessity for preventing the distorting of traffic upon the railroads of the United States such as would be accom plished by an effort by foreign carriers to divert the export and import traffic now 199THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY moving between Pacific Coast ports of the United States and the Orient either to British Colombia or to ports of the Atlan tic The movement of a certain share of the Oriental business over western American rail lines is necessary to prevent increased costs of transportation of foodstuffs be tween the West and the centers of popula tion    Any effort on the part of foreign carriers to accomplish the diversion of such business would be undoubtedly considered an emergency under which the Interstate Commerce Commission would act through absolute embargo if necessary to prevent such effort from being successful Surely no sane citizen of the United States in full possession of all the facts would be so unjust as to charge that any department of the Government would do other than take whatever action was neces sary to protect the interests of the United States and maintain undisturbed the move ments over American rail lines the balanc ing of which is so essential to the public weal The position of Admiral Benson as set forth in the preceding paragraphs is understandable It may be permitted however even to a sane person to doubt whether the Interstate Com merce Commission can control the movement of that great volume of traffic originating in the territory close to the Great Lakes and to the Canadian border and further whether the Com mission is ever likely deliberately to divert business from ports on the eastern seaboard solely in order to dis tribute it among other sections which for one reason or another may desire a share Certainly this may be done if eastern terminals are unable to handle the freight but inability of this sort is a temporary matter and traders in the West frankly disbelieve in the willing ness of any branch of the Government to force traffic out of its natural chan nels over any considerable period of time in order to protect the interests of any group of men Of some interest in this connection is the fact that the Tacoma Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution in August 1920 requesting the Shipping Board to call upon the Interstate Commerce Commission to establish immediately and enforce an embargo against the movement of all freight through Atlantic and Gulf ports via the Panama Canal route to trans Pacific ports and to direct the move ment of all such freight through Pacific Coast ports via the transcontinental railroads The Shipping Board re fused to comply with the resolution on the ground that the subject was one which should be taken up directly with the Interstate Commerce Commission When Congress passed the Merchant Marine Act the prompt protests of western cities led on June 14 to the suspension of section 28 This suspen sion was ordered by the Interstate Com merce Commission at the instance of the Shipping Board and was to last for ninety days Following up their orig inal success Pacific Coast shippers organized to secure a further suspen sion An indefinite suspension with a long notice of withdrawal was pre ferred There was talk of a conference between representatives of coast cities and statistics were compiled showing that out of 258 transPacific departures from Pacific Coast ports during the six months ending May 31 1920 124 or nearly onehalf had sailed under foreign flags Nothing came of the proposed conference and no meeting oc curred between Admiral Benson and western shippers but an additional suspension was secured until January 1 1921 under such conditions that western men now December 1920 believe that there is no immediate likelihood of enforcement of the law They are probably correct in this cer tainly the expressions of Senator Jones and of Admiral Benson have been 200THE RAILROAD RATE DISCRIMINATION emphatic to the effect that the dis puted section will not be applied until American tonnage is adequate In a formal statement on July 2 1920 already mentioned Admiral Benson said As section 28 is to be used only where there is ample American tonnage to handle the export commerce to any particular port in a foreign country    we can not conceive how anyone who has studied the law can assume that the Shipping Board would make any general application of this section A little over a month later Senator Jones told a group of port representa tives at Tacoma Washington a very similar thing namely that he did not propose to drive foreign ships from American ports until there were Ameri can ships to take their places Still another important expression of policy in this matter is to be found in the reply of the Shipping Board to the res olutions of the Tacoma conference re questing that the provisions of section 28 of the Merchant Marine Act be suspended indefinitely and that six months previous notice of the date of its effectiveness be given The Board declined to comply with the resolution but observed You may be assured that the provisions of this section section 28 will be admin istered by the Shipping Board with the utmost discretion and that as provided in the bill they shall not be enforced unless and until adequate American shipping is available In view of all this it is felt that it is better to suspend the operation of this section from time to time rather than to cause an indefinite postponement of its effectiveness There is some difficulty in determin ing whether the present conciliatory attitude of the Shipping Board is due to the vigorous protests of western shippers or whether the policy now an nounced is the one which was in mind from the beginning The absence of any public discussion of section 28 until after the Merchant Marine Act had been passed leaves the ordinary citizen in the dark in matters such as these It does however seem reason ably probable that the clauses in the act relating to export and to import rates will not now become operative for a considerable time and that when the section containing them is enforced the Shipping Board will proceed cautiously with full attention to the adequacy or inadequacy of American shipping at each and every port affected I ques tion whether the Shipping Board would have exercised the same degree of deliberation had the western communi ties been less well organized and the grounds for their objections less forci bly presented As a matter of fact Pacific Coast cities believe that section 28 is dead and no longer press their opposition to it The section is not dead yet it is to be hoped that the recent full discussion of its possibilities has lessened the danger that this law will be arbitrarily applied 201

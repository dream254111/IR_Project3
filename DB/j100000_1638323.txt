right to the present undertaking by substantial con tributions to at least two distinct fields of re search It is obvious of course that a field so vast can not be covered satisfactorily in a single volume of moderate size Accepting this limi tation as inevitable and setting aside criti cisms which unmindful of it one might pass readily it may be said at once that the effort is remarkably successful Indeed I am un acquainted with a better book particularly in the matter of unexpected suggestiveness towards the close notably of equal or briefer compass I would commend the spirited sometimes eloquent picture of the medieval mind pp 64 f the lucid account of Newton pp 128 f the absorbing tale of the rise of electrical science pp 181 f the generous tribute to Darwin pp 209f and the last chapter pp 233 f which is in itself enough to justify the book It is a pleasure to meet devotees of natural knowledge who not only can write but evince sane appreciation of hu manistic knowledge The blots are few Here and there espe cially in the Introduction and on the last page the authors permit themselves to be be trayed into what I take the liberty to call silly remarks about philosophy and metaphysics Plainly their Wissenschaft knows not these subjects as Wissenschaft This is the more striking that in other contexts they make most ample amends I mention this because it punctuates the contrast between themselves and Dr Th Merz with whom they are likely to be compared They may feel his catholic ity they do not always observe it The racetheory a result of their sociolog ical inquiries which Mr and Mrs Whetham apply to their subject is one of the fascinating features of the book Natural knowledge has been formulated and developed by the races of northwestern Europe It is pos sible that danger to science as to society lies ahead    The dominance of the universal proletariat which some dread and others ac claima proletariat not dissimilar in race to the southern rulers of the Roman Church may threaten in the future the freedom of en quiry the fearless exercise of reason the full development of personality that form the life blood of the northern race and its scientific achievement If the same race once more gains ascendancy in northern lands as by the differential birthrate and the downward shift of political power it seems destined to do it is difficult to believe that scientific results which threaten its prejudices or are not in ac cord with its ideals will be respected pp 27980 Darwin was a conspicuous product of the AngloDanish and East Anglian folk who have done most for the progress of sci ence And so Mr Whetham is able to con struct a great brief for his own the East Anglian university Nevertheless I do not see why he should have omitted Macquorn Rankine in reference to the foundation of thermodynamics p 179 Nor does his theory of the mysticism of the northern race supply the reason why Kelvin  is said to have begun his lectures on physics with the Collect for the day p 158 As a pupil I may say that Kelvin did so but because it was the uni versal custom at Glasgow to open the morn ing classes with prayer Nevertheless I ac cept the theory as indeed I mustmy pa ternal ancestors for generations are East Anglians And yet I am in doubt for I still traffic in speculative philosophy tossed about by every wind of doctrine p 7 But it were too hard a test to ask an author to prove his theory on the corpus vile of a re viewer of whom he neverheard tell So once more I say the book is thoroughly worth while R M WENLEY ANN

general ac count of the Coleoptera2 There is a discus sion of the several recent classifications of Coleoptera the author using although hardly accepting three principal divisions Adephaga Polycerata and Lamellicornia The essential characters are given for each family 103 of which are recognized by Fowler and a short account of their habits larvae distribution and peculiar forms A glossary of technical terms used in Coleoptera is also included Jn the main part of the work the Indian tiger beetles are fully described and many illus trated in text figures The part on the Paus sidae includes a summary of their habits and the little known about their larvae The Rhysodidoe and Cupedidae are also treated in this volume each with only a few species OF all the peculiar termitophilous insects the Histerid beetle recently described by Dr E Mljberg will easily rank as the most re markable It is a native of course of Aus tralia There are two tufts or pencils of long curved hairs arising from each side of the base of the elytra The termites gather a se cretion from these hairs but it is not known whether the secretion comes from the hairs The insect is named Eucurtia paradoxa THE value of minute structures in classifi cation is well illustrated by an article on the classification of the bed bugs by Dr K Jor dan and N C Rothschild4 They divide the The Fauna of British India including

gives a bibliography of South American bees since Dalla Torres catalogue a synopsis of the sixtyeight genera known from the region the geographical distribution of each genus in some cases a list of the described species and descriptions of a few new forms PROFESSOR T MIYAKE has given the most complete account so far of the life history of a Panorpid The eggs are deposited in clus ters of from six to ten in crevices in the soil The larva of the Japanese species is similar to that of the European and American spe cies already figured They probably pass through seven molts the perforations in the spiracles increasing in number with each molt The larvae feed on dead insects There are two broods in a year The adults were ob served to feed on dead insects and the petals of a flower None have

structure and habits of myriopods and follows with an annotated list of the 64 species so far de scribed from Chili Many of the genera are different from those of our country and sev eral are peculiar

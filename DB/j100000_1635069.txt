j100000,Science,1635069,A Cycad from the Upper Cretaceous in Maverick County Texas,i296032,SCIENCE spots on apple leaves which had been punc tured with a hot needle The fungus was later found on dead apple twigs in Morgan town W Va almost touching a live branch whose leaves bore spots containing Conio thyrium fruits There were but few spotted leaves on the remainder of the tree Pro fessor Alwood in a letter to Dr Sheldon which the writer was permitted to see states that the fungus winters over on the fallen leaves The writer has not so far been able to find fruits of the fungus on fallen leaves during the winter and spring Coniothyriwum pirina then occurs in spots on living leaves of apple cherryl0 quince and pear and on dead twigs of apple and quince It is able under certain conditions to produce spots on apple leaves but nevertheless it is merely a facultative parasite and probably does not cause the serious defoliation of apple trees in West Virginia which has been at tributed to itl It seems able to winter over on twigs of apple and quince Since in the field Coryneum foliicolum gave more evidence of being important than Conio thyriuwm pirina culture work with it was also done The fungus was grown on the ordinary culture media and on sterilized twigs of vari ous kinds including spruce twigs On syn thetic agar the hyphae at first bore conidia singly on short branches and all the spores grown on agar were long irregular and with cells often subdivided making the spores as many asi sevenseptate this corresponds closely to the behavior of Coryneum beyerinckii re cently reported by Smith On some of the media cellular subcarbonaceous structures de veloped sometimes becoming flaskshaped with long necks In August the fungus was found fruiting on a canker on a young apple trunk Apparently the spores were borne inside sub carbonaceous pycnidia but the immaturity of most of the fruits prevented definite deter mination of this point A pure culture

cultures taken from leafspots Some inoculation work with Coryneum foliicolum along the same lines as that with Coniothyrium pirina gave similar results ex cept that the Coryneum gave even less evi dence of vigorous parasitism than did the Coniothyrium It is not likely therefore that it is any more important as a cause of disease Acknowledgments are due to Professor F C Stewart Dr Fr Bubak and Dr G B Traverso for sending specimens to Dr C H Peck for identification of a specimen of Phyl losticta limitata to Mrs Flora W Patterson for determination of a specimen of Uoryneum foliicolum and to Dr J L Sheldon for advice and the use of data and specimens previously obtained by him CARL P HARTLEY MINNEAPOLIS MINN A CYCAD FROM THE UPPER CRETACEOUS IN MAVERICK COUNTY TEXAS IN the fall of 1905 I found a cycad in the Upper Cretaceous of Texas The locality was three miles north and one and one half miles west of the station called Paloma on the Eagle Pass branch of the Southern Pacific Railroad and about twenty miles south of Spofford At this place the Upson clay is exposed on the east side of Sauz Creek which joins with Cow Creek to form Elm Creek a half mile to the south The exposure runs for a quarter mile north and south and is con siderably cut up by gullies At the north end the clay was dark and it contained a Radiolites a small Ostrea an Anomia and Exogyra pon derosa This last shell is frequent over the whole exposure Eight fragments of pre sumably the same silicified trunk were noted Three of these matched by their fractures and showed a stem about ten inches wide flattened considerably and hollow These three and one more fragment were all that I could carry and they have been turned over to a specialist for study The clay containing these fossils has been by Dumble called the Upson clay and is de scribed in Augustana Library Publications JULY 31 1908N S VOL XXVIII No 709 No 6 p 68 It is from 500 to 600 feet thick in this vicinity and the stratum of this par ticular exposure is included somewhere in the upper 150 feet of the formation Some sand stone ledges appearing a mile and a half south contain Ostrea larva and impressions of Halymenites and these ledges mark the be ginning of the change to the overlying San Miguel beds This trunk comes from at least 1400 feet above the base of the Upper Creta ceous in this state The Upson clay is under lain by about 750 feet of limestone of the age of the Austin chalk and below this there are here some 250 feet of sediments corresponding to the Eagle Ford shales So far as I am aware this is the only known cycad yet found in the Upper Cretaceous of America J A UDDEN ROCK ISLAND ILL SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIEt THE TORREY BOTANICAL CLUB THE club was called to order on May 27 1908 at the Museum Building of the New York Botan ical Garden at 4 PM by Vicepresident John Hendley Barnhart Eight persons were present After the reading and approval of the minutes for May 12 1908 the announced scientific pro gram was presented The following abstracts were prepared by the authors of the papers The North American Species of Zygodo  Mrs N L BRITTON Attention was called to the fact that Zygodon viridissimus is a rare species having been found only a few times in the high mountains of the southern Alleghanies and northern New York It is usually sterile and propagates by septate broodbodies borne in clusters in the axils of the leaves Fruiting specimens collected by Dr J K Small on the summit of White Top Virginia showed that the peristome is absent though all the capsules found were either too young or too old for satisfactory determination A comparison with specimens collected by Drummond near Hud son Bay shows that the latter belong to Zygodon rupestris which is variously placed by European authors as either a species or a variety of Z viri dissimus Sterile specimens of Zygodon gracilis have been recently discovered in North Carolina by Dr A J Grout Zygodon excelsus whose fruit is also still unknown appears to be more eloselv related to Leptodontium than to Zygodon The Acceleration of the Period of Senescence by Radium Rays C STUABT GAGER In view of the fact already well known that as old age approaches the size of the cellnucleus becomes less relative to that of the cell measure ments were made to see if this relation was af fected by exposure to radium rays It was found that in cells near the roottip of Zea Mays the diameter of the nucleus was 355 per cent that of the cells in unexposed plants but only 3333 per cent in roots exposed to radium rays This is some evidence that exposure to radium rays accelerates the approach of the period of senes cence A Collection of Philippine Fungi W A MUBRSL A splendid collection of fungi six hundred and thirtyseven packets in all was recently received from the Bureau of Science Manila through Mr E D Merrill botanist Previous work upon the fungi of this region was briefly sketched and the collections of Philippine fungi in various institu tions compared This paper will be published in full with notes and description of interesting species in a future number of the Bulletin of the Torrey Botanical Club An announced paper on Botanical Supplies in the Public Schools was not given on account of Dr Hollicks unavoidable absence At the close of the stated program Dr Gager exhibited some photographs of flowers etc taken in natural color at the New York Botanical Gar den by the Lumiere process The process was briefly explained Dr Murrill exhibited a specimen of Tuck ahoe and called attention to the fact that the sporophore of a Polyporus had been obtained from a form common in parts of Canada the Tuck ahoe being a sclerotium or a resting stage of the mycelium in mass He would be glad to receive specimens of these sclerotia either fresh or dried from any locality so that the various species if more than one exists in this country may be properly distinguished Dr Barnhart exhibited for Mr Nash a flower ing specimen of the lacebark tree Lagetta Lin tearia a native of the West Indies This tree is known to have flowered only once before in cul tivation An article on the specimen and the peculiarities and uses of the lacelike bark ap peared in the June 1908 number of the Journal of the New York Botanical Garden C STUART GAGER Secretary 160 SCIENCE

and the fact of such adverse holding rests only in parol testimony In the case of a judicial sale says the court where ques tions may be reasonably raised affecting the title the courts are more ready to relieve a purchaser than where the contract arises out of a private transaction between the parties but even in the latter case if resort must be had to parol evidence if it depends upon questions of fact then a purchaser should and will not be compelled to perform his contract Holly v Hirsch 135 N Y 590 32 N E 709 Heller v Cohen 154 N Y 299 48 N E 527 Moot v Association 157 N Y 201 52 N E 1 The general subject of specific performance of contracts for the sale of real estate where the title rests only on adverse possession is discussed with a full review of the authorities in 33 Am Law Review 357 LEGACTESDEMONSTRATIVE AND SPECIFICTestatrix devised to her daughter all of her real estate and all money belonging to her on deposit in the daughters name with directions that the latter should out of the moneys belonging to me on deposit in her name pay to my son the sum of fifteen hundred dollars At the date of the will the testatrix had on deposit in her daughters name 1800 but at the time of her death considerably less than 1500 On a bill filed by the son to require the daughter who was also executrix to pay the full amount of 1500 to the son Held That the legacy to the son was specific and not demonstrative and hence was adeemed pro tanto by withdrawal of the fund from bank by the testatrix in her lifetime Crawford v McCarthy N Y 54 N E 277 The court holds that a mere gift of or out of a particular fund is not demon strative but specific To constitute the legacy a demonstrative one two elements are essential 1 A bequest in the nature of a general legacy and 2 It must point to a fund out of which the payment is to be made In this case the first of these elements was lacking The gift was not of 1500 to be paid out of the fund in bank but of 1500 out of the deposit If the gift had been all moneys on deposit or half of the funds on deposit this would clearly have been specific So a specified amount of the funds on deposit is likewise specific The case is a close one but the decision appears to be sound NEGOTIABLE PAPERPREMATURE ACTIONIn Humphreys v Sutcliffe 43 Atl 954 the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania discusses the unsettled question whether an action may be brought against the maker of a promissory note on the day of its maturity after presentment demand and protest The court concludes that the weight of authority is in favor of the maintenance of the action Citing 2 Parsons Bills  N 461 Greeley v Thurston 4 Greenl 479 On this subject it is said in 2 Daniel Neg Instr 1208 In case of ordinary contracts to be performed upon a certain day they are really solvable within that day and as the promisor has the whole of that day for their performance suit cannot be commenced until that day has passed But where the maker of a note or the drawer or acceptor of a bill makes it payable on a day certain his contract is to pay it on demand on any part of that day if made within reasonable hours The protest must be made on that day which presupposes a default already made 1899 329 NOTES OF CASES330 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept and whether it be the last day of grace or the day of maturity when there is no grace it is clear upon principle that as soon as payment is refused the action may be commenced In other sections the author shows that the authorities are like Swiss troops fighting on both sides Sees 12071210 As to the indorser the rule seems to be that no action can be commenced against him until the notice is duly mailed but the holder need not wait until the notice is received If mailed on the day of dishonor

invalid as an unlawful interference with the liberty of the citizen City of Buffalo v Collins Baking Co 57 N Y Supp 347 As said by the court the police power under which the law may interfere with ones private business is confined to protection of the life health comfort and property of the citizen Here there was no question of the protection of any of these Loaves weighing less were as

109 N Y 399 17 N E 345 in its broad sense as understood in this country means the right not only of freedom from servitude imprisonment or restraint but the right of one to use his faculties in all lawful ways to live and work where he will to earn his livelihood in any lawful calling and to pursue any lawful trade or avocation In Allgeyer v Louisiana 165 U S 578 the Supreme Court of the United States for the first time construed the term liberty in the Fourteenth Amendment as including the liberty of contractas meaning not only the right of the citizen to be free from the mere physical

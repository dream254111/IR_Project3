LORD BISHOP OF WORCESTER,I206886,343 II AN EXTRACT OF TWO LETTERS FROM DR JOHN WALLIS PROFESSOR OF GEOMETRY IN OXFORD THE ONE TO HIS GRACE THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY THE OTHER TO THE LORD BISHOP OF WORCESTER CONCERNING THE ALTERATION SUGGESTED OF THE JULIAN ACCOUNT FOR THE GREGORIAN F O R THE MOST REVEREND FATHER IN GOD THOMAS LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY HIS GRACE AT LAMBETH OXFORD JUNE 13 1699 MAY IT PLEASE YOUR GRACE AS TO WHAT YOUR GRACE MENTIONS IN THE CLOSE OF YOUR LETTER WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR TO RECEIVE ABOUT ALTERING THE ANNUAL STILE I AM AT A LOSS WHAT TO SAY THAT THERE IS IN OUR ECCLESIASTICAL COM PUTATION OF THE PASCHAL TABLES SOMEWHAT OF DISORDER IS NOT TO BE DENYD BUT I AM VERY DOUBTFUL THAT IF WE GO TO ALTER THAT IT WILL BE ATTENDED WITH GREATER MISCHIEF THAN THE PRESENT INCONVENIENCE IT IS DAN GEROUS REMOVING THE OLD LANDMARKS      A THING OF MOMENT WHEN ONCE SETTLED F F F THOUGH344 THOUGH WITH SOME INCONVENIENCE SHOULD NOT BE RASHLY ALTERD SUCH CHANGES MAY HAVE A FURTHER PROSPECT THAN MEN AT FIRST SIGHT ARE AWARE OF AND MAY BE AT TENDED WITH THOSE EVILS WHICH ARE NOT PRESENTLY AP PREHENDED IN THE BUSINESS OF GEOGRAPHY UPON REMOVING THE FIRST MERIDIAN UPON SOME PLAUSIBLE PRETENCE FROM WHERE PTOLOMY HAD PLACD IT THOUGH A THING AT FIRST PURELY ARBITRARY IT IS NOW COME TO PASS THAT WE HAVE IN A MANNER NO FIRSTMERIDIAN AT ALL THAT IS NONE FIXED BUT EVERY NEW MAPMAKER PLACETH HIS FIRST MERIDIAN WHERE HE PLEASETH WHICH HATH BROUGHT A GREAT CONFUSION IN GEOGRAPHY AND AS TO THE POINT IN QUESTION THE DISORDER IN THE PASCHAL TABLES WAS A THING NOTED AND COMPLAINED OF FOR THREE OR FOUR HUNDRED YEARS BEFORE POPE GREGORY DID UNHAPPILY ATTEMPT THE CORRECTION OF THE CA LENDAR BUT IT WAS ALL THAT TIME THOUGHT ADVISEABLE RATHER TO SUFFER THAT INCONVENIENCE THAN BY CORRECTING IT TO RUN THE HAZARD OF A GREATER MISCHIEF AND IT HAD BEEN MUCH BETTER IF IT HAD SO CONTINUED TO THIS DAY RATHER THAN POPE GREGORY UPON HIS OWN SINGLE AUTHORITY SHOULD TAKE UPON HIM TO IMPOSE A LAW ON ALL THE CHURCHES KINGDOMS AND STATES OF CHRISTEN DOM TO ALTER BOTH THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL AND CIVIL YEAR FOR A WORSE FORM THAN WHAT BEFORE WE HAD OR IF MERELY UPON ACCOUNT OF THE PASCHAL TABLES FOR HE MADE NO OTHER PRETENCE IT WERE THOUGHT NE CESSARY TO MAKE A CHANGE HE MIGHT HAVE CORRECTED THE PASCHAL TABLES OR GIVEN US NEW PASCHAL TABLES INSTEAD OF THOSE OF DIONYSIUS WITHONT ALTERING THE CIVIL YEAR WHICH HATH INTRODUCED THE CONFUSION WHICH WE NOW COMPLAIN OF OF THE OLD AND NEW STILE AND WHICH NOW CAN NEVER BE REMEDIED UNLESS ALL NATIONS SHOULD AT ONCE AGREE UPON ONE WHICH IS NOT TO BE SUPPOSED I345 I SAY AT ONCE FOR IF SOME SOONER AND SOME LATER DO ALTER THEIR STILE THE CONFUSION IN HISTORY WILL YET BE GREATER THAN NOW IT IS TIS TRUE THAT UPON PRETENCE OF THE POPES USUR PED SUPREMACY IN SPIRITUALS AND IN TEMPORALS ALSO IN ORDER TO SPIRITUALS MOST POPISH COUNTRIES BUT I THINK NOT ALL HAVE SUBMITTED THEIR CIVIL YEAR AS WELL AS THEIR ECCLESIASTICAL TO THE SINGLE AUTHORITY OF THE POPES BULL BUT YOUR GRACE KNOWS VERY WELL THAT THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND HAD LONG BEFORE THIS PRETENDED CORRECTION RENOUNCED THE POPES SUPREMACY AND THAT BEING SUP POSED THERE IS NO PRETENCE FOR THE POPE OF ROMES IMPOSING A LAW ON THE CHURCH AND KINGDOM OF EN GLAND TO CHANGE OUR ECCLESIASTICAL AND CIVIL YEAR MORE THAN IN US FOR THAT IN ROME AND UPON THIS ACCOUNT THE CHURCH AND KINGDOM OF ENGLAND DID AT FIRST NOT ADMIT OF THAT CHANGE AND HAVE HITHERTO RETAINED OUR OLD CONSTITUTION OF THE JU LIAN YEAR NOTWITHSTANDING THE POPES PRETENDED SUPREMACY AND I SEE NOT WHY WE SHOULD NOW ADMIT IT AFTER HAVING SO LONG RENOUNCED IT AND REALLY THOUGH IT MAY NOT YET APPEAR AND BE OWNED ABOVE BOARD AND THOSE WHO NOW PRESS FOR AN ALTERATION BE NOT AWARE OF IT AND BE FAR FROM ANY POPISH DESIGN I CANNOT BUT THINK THERE IS AT BOTTOM A LATENT POPISH INTEREST WHICH UNDER OTHER SPECIOUS PRETENCES SETS IT ON FOOT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN IN PRACTISE A KIND OF TACIT SUBMISSION TO THE POPES SUPREMACY OR OWNING HIS AUTHORITY AND THOUGH THEY BE SO WISE AS TO SAY NOTHING OF IT AT PRESENT FOR THE BAIT IS DESIGNED TO HIDE THE HOOK TILL THE FISH BE CAUGHT THEY WILL PLEASE THEMSELVES TO HAVE GAIND DE FACTO WHAT IN WORDS WE DISCLAIM FOR THERE IS NOTHING BUT THE POPS BULL WHICH SHOULD INDUCE THE CHANGE OF THE CIVIL JULIAN YEAR WHICH IS MUCH BETTER FOR THE F F F 2 NEW346 NEW GREGORIAN FOR THE EQUINOX GOING BACKWARD FOR 10 OR 11 MINUTES EACH YEAR IS VERY INCONSIDERABLE AND WHICH IN CELESTIAL COMPUTATIONS IS EASILY RECTIFIED AS ARE MANY OTHER INEQUALITIES OF MUCH GREATER CON CERNMENT AND I THINK IT WAS NEVER PRETENDED THAT THE CIVIL YEAR MUST NEEDS AGREE EXACTLY TO A MINUTE WITH THE CELESTIAL AND IF NEVER SO MUCH AFFECTED IS IMPOSSI BLE TO BE HAD FOR THE SOLAR YEAR AND THE SIDEREAL YEAR DIFFER MORE FROM EACH OTHER THAN THE JULIAN FROM EITHER WHICH IS A MIDLDE BETWIXT THEM AND THE SEAT OF EASTER WHICH ONLY CONCERNS THE ECCLESIASTICAL NOT THE CIVIL YEAR MAY EASILY BE RECTIFIED IF NEED BE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE CIVIL YEAR AT ALL OR IF NOT RECTIFIED THE CELEBRATION OF EASTER A WEEK OR MONTH SOONER OR LATER DOTH NOT INFLUENCE AT ALL OUR SOLEMN COMMEMORATION OF CHRISTS RESUR RECTION AND TIS AGREEDBY MOST IF NOT ALL CHRONOLOGERS THAT AS TO THE YEAR OF OUR LORD THE ANNUS VULGARIS IS NOT THE ANNUS VERUS THOUGH IT BE NOT AGREED HOW MUCH IT DIFFERS BUT IT WOULD BE A HORRIBLE CONFUSION IN HI STORY IF WE SHOULD NOW GO ABOUT TO ALTER THE VULGAR ACCOUNT ALL THE PRETENCE THAT I CAN UNDERSTAND FOR ALTERING OUR STILE IS ONLY THAT IN SO DOING WE SHOULD AGREE WITH SOME OF OUR NEIGHBOURS WITH WHOM WE NOW DIFFER BUT IT WILL THEN BE AS TRUE THAT WE SHALL DIFFER FROM OTHERS WITH WHOM WE DO NOW AGREE WE SHOULD AGREE WITH FRANCE BUT DIFFER FROM SCOTLAND WHICH AS TO US IS MORE CON SIDERABLE AND WITH ALL OTHERS WHO YET FOLLOW THE OLD STILE IF IT BE SAID THAT THEY IN TIME MAY COME SO TO DO BY OUR EXAMPLE THIS WOULD BUT MAKE THE CONFUSION YET THE GREATER FOR THEN WE MUST BE OBLIGED NOT ONLY347 ONLY TO KNOW WHAT PLACES DO USE THE NEW STILE BUT FROM WHAT TIME THEY BEGAN SO TO DO IF WE WOULD UN DERSTAND THEIR DATES AND IF WE SHOULD BY A NEW LAW ALTER OUR STILE IN ENGLAND THIS WOULD NOT COMPRISE SCOTLAND AND WE CANNOT PROMISE OUR SELVES THAT THEY WOULD PRESENTLY COMPLY ALSO FOR ACCORDING TO THE PRESENT CONSTITU TION OF THAT CHURCH THEY ARE NOT SO PLIABLE TO COM PLY WITH THE MODES OF ROME AS SOME IN ENGLAND ARE AND THE BUSINESS OF EASTER WHICH HAS THE SOLE PRE TENCE OF THE FIRST ALTERATION WOULD TO THEM SIGNIFIE NOTHING WHO ACCORDING TO THEIR CONSTITUTION OB SERVE NO EASTER AT ALL BUT DO RATHER DECLARE AGAINST IT AND WHEN ALL IS DONE THERE WILL STILL BE A NECESSI TY OF KEEPING UP THE DISTINCTION OF OLD STILE AND NEW STILE WHICH POPE GREGORYS PRETENDED CORRECTION HATH MADE NECESSARY AND WITH THAT DISTINCTION THINGS MAY BE NOW AS WELL ADJUSTED AS IF WE SHOULD NOW CHANGE OUR STILE I FORBEAR TO DISCOURSE AT LARGE THAT I BE NOT TOO TE DIOUS HOW MUCH A BETTER CONSTITUTION THE JULIAN YEAR IS AND MORE ADVISABLE THAN THE NEW GREGORIAN WHICH IS A THING SO NOTORIOUS THAT NO ASTRONOMER WHO UNDERSTANDS THE METHODS OF ASTRONOMICAL CALCU LATIONS THOUGH A PAPIST CAN BE IGNORANT OF HOWE VER THEY MAY PLEASE TO DISSEMBLE IT INSOMUCH THAT IN THEIR ASTRONOMICAL CALCULATIONS THEY ARE FAIN SIRST TO ADJUST THEIR CALCULATIONS TO THE JULIAN YEAR AND THENCE TRANSFER THEM TO THEIR NEW GREGORIAN AND CONSEQUENTLY HOW UNREASONABLE IT IS FOR US TO EXCHANGE OUR BETTER JULIAN YEAR FOR ONE THAT IS SO MUCH WORSE IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE SAVE THAT THEY WILL NEVER BE INDUCED TO PART WITH OUGHT WHICH MAY FAVOUR THEIR USURPATION HOW ABSURD SOEVER THAT THE PAPISTS348 PAPISTS SHOULD QUIT THEIR NEW GREGORIAN AND RETURN TO THEIR OLD JULIAN YEAR BUT I FORBEAR TO ENLARGE ON THIS AND MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH MIGHT BE ALLEDGD AND HUM BLY BEG YOUR GRACES PARDON FOR HAVING ALREADY GIVEN YOU THE TROUBLE OF TOO LONG A LETTER AND AM MY LORD YOUR GRACES VERY HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT SERVANT JOHN WALLIS A P O S TS C R I P T TO BE ADDED TO A FORMER LETTER TO THE LORD ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY POST SCRIPT AUG 31 1699 OF WHAT MR LOCK HATH DONE IN THIS MATTER I KNOW NOTHING BUT FROM YOUR GRACES LETTER OF AUG 27 1699IT SEEMS HE ADVISES THAT FOR ELEVEN LEAPYEARS WE SHOULD OMIT THE INTERCALATION OF FEBR 29 AND THENCE FORTH GO ON WITH THE GREGORIAN ACCOUNT THE LAST OF WHICH 11 LEAPYEARS SHOULD BE 1744 BUT IF WE BE GIN IN THE CHANGE AS IT IS SUGGESTED AT THE YEAR 1700 THE LAST OF THOSE ELEVEN LEAPYEARS MUST BE 1740 NOT 1744 THIS349 THIS EXPEDIENT IS THE SAME THAT WAS DURING OUR CIVILWARS SUGGESTEDLY THOSE THEN AT OXFORD IN THE YEAR 1645 VIZ THAT FROM THENCE FORWARD WE SHOULD OMIT TEN SUCH INTERCALATIONS AGAINST WHICH THERE SEEMS TO ME THIS GREAT OBJE CTION IN THE TIME OF JULIUS AND AUGUSTUS CAESAR THERE WAS A YEAR WHICH WAS CALLED ANNUS CONFUSIONIS UPON THE SET TLING UNSETTLING AND RESETTLING THE JULIAN YEAR OF WHICH KEPLER GIVES AN ACCOUNT WITH THE MISCHIEFS OF IT IN HIS TABULAE RUDOLPHINAE WITH THE TITLE TYPUS AN NI CONFUSIONIS AND THE LIKE IN THE YEAR 1582 WHEN POPE GREGORY DID AT ONCE STRIKE OUT TEN DAYS OF THAT YEAR BUT IF THIS ADVICE SHOULD TAKE PLACE WE SHOULD NOW INSTEAD OF ONE ANNUS CONFUSIONIS HAVE A CONFUSION FOR FOUR AND FORTY YEARS TOGETHER WHEREIN WE SHOULD AGREE NEITHER WITH THE OLD NOR WITH THE NEW ACCOUNT BUT BE SOMETIMES 10 DAYS SOMETIMES 9 DAYS SOMETIMES 8 DAYS AND SO FORTH LATER THAN THE ONE AND SOONER THAN THE OTHER ACCOUNT AND A FORREIGNER WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO JUDGE OF AN ENGLISH DATE WITHOUT KNOWING IN WHICH OF THESE YEARS WE VARY 10 9 OR 8 DAYS AND SO FORTH FROM EITHER OF THESE ACCOUNTS AND THIS FOR 44 YEARS TOGETHER WHICH SEEMS TO ME A MUCH GREATER CONFUSION THEN IF AS IN 1582 WE SHOULD ONCE FOR ALL CAST OUT 11 DAYS BUT I CANNOT THINK IT ADVISABLE TO DO EITHER F O R350 F O R THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD WILLIAM LORD BISHOP OF WORCESTER AT WHITEHALL OXFORD JUNE 30 1699 MAY IT PLEASE YOUR LORDSHIP IN A LATE LETTER WHICH I HAD THE HONOUR TO RECEIVE FROM MY LOTD ARCHBISHOPS GRACE OF CANTERBURY HIS GRACE WAS PLEASED TO INTIMATE AS A THING NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION ABOUT CHANGING THE STILE OF OUR CIVIL YEAR IT MAY PERHAPS BE PRESUMPTION IN ME TO INTERPOSE MY THOUGHTS WITH YOUR LORDSHIP IN A BUSINESS OF THAT NATURE BUT I MUST NEEDS THINK IT A  POINT TO TOUCH UPON AND WHICH IF WE ATTEMPT IT MAY BE AT TENDED WITH GREATER MISCHIEFS THAN WE MAY AT FIRST BE AWARE OF I ADVENTURED TO SAY SOMEWHAT TO THAT PUR POSE IN A LETTER TO HIS GRACE BUT MORE MAY BE SAID THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF STILES DOTH CREATE SOME CONSU SION IN HISTORY IS NOT TO BE DENYED AND TIS VERY UN HAPPY THAT POPE GREGORY XIII DID IN THE LAST CENTURY ATTEMPT IT BUT IT IS NOW UNAVOIDABLE AND CANNOT BE REMEDIED FOR TIS NOT ENGLAND ONLY THAT USETH THE JULIAN YEAR BUT ALL THE THREE KINGDOMS OF ENGLAND SCOTLAND AND IRELAND AND ALL OUR FOREIGN PLANTATIONS WHICH ARE NOT A FEW AND THE TWO KINGDOMS OF DENMARK AND SWE DEN THE PROTESTANT CANTONS OF SWITZERLAND AND FOUR OF THE SEVEN UNITED PROVINCES AND HOW MANY MORE OF THE PROTESTANTS IN GERMANY I CANNOT PRESENTLY SAY AND IF WE SHOULD NOW CHANGE OUR STILE IN COMPLIANCE WITH SOME OF OUR POPISH NEIGHBOURS FROM WHOM WE DIFFER351 DIFFER WE SHOULD THEN VARY FROM THE PROTESTANTS WITH WHOM WE NOW AGREE AND PARTICULARLY FROM SCOTLAND WITH WHOM WE ARE MORE CONCERNED TO AGREE THAN WITH FRANCE FOR WE ARE NOT TO PRESUME THAT THEY WILL PRESENTLY CHANGE AT THE SAME TIME WITH US TIS HAPPY THAT THEY DID COMPLY WITH US IN THE LATE REVOLUTION TO BE UNDER THE SAME KING WITH US WE CANNOT PRESUME THEY WILL BE SO FOND OF COMPLIANCE IN ALL THE MODES OF ROME  AS IS VERY EVIDENT IN THEIR NOT ADMITTING EPI SCOPACY NOR THE OBSERVATION OF EASTER WHICH LATTER WAS THE ONLY PRETENCE OF FIRST INTRODUCING THE GREGORIAN YEAR SO THAT THERE WILL STILL BE AS GREAT NECESSITY OF SV AND SN OLD STILE AND NEW STILE AS NOW THERE IS WITHOUT WHICH WE SHALL BE AT A LOSS IN HISTORY TO JUDGE DISTINCTLY OF DATES AND WITH IT WE ARE NOW AS EASY AS IF WE CHANGE IF IT BE SAID THAT OTHER PROTESTANTS MAY IN TIME BE INDUCED TO FOLLOW OUR EXAMPLE PERHAPS SOME MAY NOT ALL BUT THIS WOULD BUT MAKE THE CONFUSION YET GREATER FOR THENCEFORTH WE MUST BE OBLIGED IF WE WOULD BE AT A CERTAINTY IN HISTORY NOT ONLY TO KNOW WHAT COUNTRIES DO USE THIS OR THAT STILE BUT FROM WHAT TIME THEY BEGAN SO TO DO IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE ADVISABLE IF THE PAPISTS WOULD BE AS COMPLIANT AS THEY WOULD HAVE US TO BE FOR THE PA PISTS TO RETURN TO THEIR OLD JULIAN YEAR THAN FOR US TO EM BRACE THEIR NEW GREGORIAN AND IT MIGHT MUCH EAFIER BE EFFECTED FOR IF THE POPE COULD BE PERSUADED TO GRANT A BULL TO THAT PURPOSE ALL THE PAPISTS WOULD AT ONCE BE AS MUCH OBLIGED SO TO DO AS BY POPE GRE GORYS BULL TO VARY FROM IT IF IT BE SAID THERE IS NO HOPES OF THAT THEN THE ARGUMENT STANDS IF THE POPE WILL NOT LEAVE HIS PRETENDED SUPREMACY THEN WE MUST ADMIT IT G G G THAT352 THAT THE JULIAN YEAR IS IN IT SELF A BETTER FORM AND MORE ADVISABLE THAN THE NEW GREGORIAN IS UN DENIABLE AND ALL AFTRONOMERS EVEN PAPISTS THEM SELVES IF NOT OTHERWISE BIGOTED IN FAVOUR OF THE POPES SUPREMACY AND THE INFALLIBILITY OF THE ROMAN CHURCH CANNOT BUT KNOW IT INSOMUCH THAT IN MANY CASES THEY ARE FAIN OR FIND IT ADVISABLE FIRST TO ADJUST THEIR CALCULATIONS TO THE JULIAN YEAR AND THENCE TRANSFER THEM TO THE GREGORIAN AND THERE IS NO INDUCEMENT FOR OUR CHANGING OUR BETTER YEAR FOR A WORSE BUT ONLY IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE POPES PRETENDED SUPREMACY NOT ONLY OVER ALL CHURCHES AND KINGDOMS BUT EVEN THE CELESTIAL MOTIONS AS POPE GREGORY IN HIS BULL DOTH WISELY PRETEND NOW TIS WELL KNOWN THAT LONG BEFORE POPE GRE GORYS BULL ENGLAND HAD RENOUNCED THE POPES SUPREMACY AND ARE THEREFORE UNCONCERNED IN THAT BULL AND I SEE NO REASON WHY AFTER SO LONG A DISCLAIMER WE SHOULD BE NOW FOND TO READMIT IT BUT WHAT GREATER EVIDENCE OF OWNING THAT AUTHORITY CAN IN PRACTICE BE EXPECTED THAN OBEYING THEIR COMMANDS IN THINGS OTHERWISE UNADVISABLE  HOC ITHACUS VELIT  MAGNO MERCENTUR ATRIDAE AND NO DOUBT BUT THE HAND OF JOAB IS IN THE MATTER THOUGH PERHAPS WE DO NOT SEE IT AS TO OUR SELVES THIS CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT ALTERING THE ACT OF UNIFORMITY AND ALTERING THE COMMON PRAYER BOOK FOR AT LEAST ALL THE CALENDAR MUST BE NEW FRAMD AND YOUR LORDSHIP KNOWS HOW WARM SOME WERE A WHILE SINCE AGAINST TOUCHING THAT IN THE LEAST OR SO MUCH AS CONSIDERING ON THE KINGS COMMISSION FOR THAT PURPOSE WHETHER OUGHT IN IT MIGHT BE CHANGED FOR THE BETTER IF YET YOUR LORDSHIP THINK IT NECESSARY THAT THE SEAT OF EASTER SHOULD BE RECTIFYD THAT MAY EASILY BE DONE WITHOUT ALTERING THE CIVIL YEAR FOR IF IN THE RULE FOR EASTER353 EASTER INSTEAD OF SAYING NEXT AFTER THE ONE AND TWENTIETH OF MARCH YOU SAY NEXT AFTER THE VERNAL EQUINOX THE WORK IS DONE AND WE MIGHT BE EXCUSED THE TROUBLE OF PASCHAL TABLES AND THE INTRICATE PERPLEXITIES OF THE GREGORIAN EPACTS FOR THEN EVERY ALMANACK WILL TELL YOU WHEN IT IS EQUINOX AND WHEN IT IS FULL MOON FOR THE PRESENT YEAR WITHOUT DISTURBING THE CIVIL ACCOUNT AND THIS POPE GREGORY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE DONE WITHOUT TROUBLING THE ACCOUNT OF CHRISTENDOM BUT IF HE WOULD NEEDS DISTURB THE CIVIL YEAR HE SHOULD HAVE RECTIFIED IT NOT TO THE TIME OF THE NICENE COUNCIL BUT TO THE TIME OF OUR SAVIOURS BIRTH FOR OUR EPOCHA IS NOT FROM THE NICENE COUNCIL BUT FROM THE BIRTH OF CHRIST WE DO NOT SAY ANNO NICENI CONCILII BUT ANNO DOMINI AND MOST CERTAIN IT IS THAT AT OUR SAVIOURS BIRTH THE VERNAL EQUINOX WAS NOT ON THE ONE AND TWENTIETH OF MARCH AS THIS NEW ACCOUNT WOULD SUPPOSE BUT NEARER TO THE FIVE AND TWENTIETH IT IS ALLEDGED AS AN ARGUMENT WHY NOW TO CHANGE BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE WHICH THIS YEAR IS BUT TEN DAYS WILL NEXT YEAR BE ELEVEN DAYS BUT MY LORD WE MUST BE VERY WEAK DISPUTANTS TO BE CAUGHT BY SUCH A FALLACY WHICH IS BARELY BEGGING THE QUESTION THE POINT IN QUESTION IS NOT WHY NOW BUT WHY AT ALL IT IS NOT WE THAT HAVE DEPARTED FROM THEM BUT THEY FROM US THE JULIAN YEAR WAS THEIR YEAR AS WELL AS OURS TILL THE YEAR 1582 WHEN A FANCY TOOK POPE GREGORY TO EXCHANGE A BETTER YEAR FOR A WORSE AND DISTURB THE CHRISTIAN WORLD AND THEN THE ARGUMENT IF IT SIGNIFIE ANY THING STANDS THUS THE FARTHER THEY BE GONE ASTRAY THE MORE REASON THERE IS THAT WE SHOULD FOLLOW THEM I SHOULD RATHER ARGUE THE MORE REASON THERE IS WHY THEY SHOULD RETURN TO THAT FROM WHENCE THEY WENT ASTRAY WE ARE AS WE WERE AND AS THEY WERE TILL THAT TIME AND THE GGG 2 REASON354 REASON WHY WE DID NOT THEN CHANGE REMAINS STILL GOOD WHY WE SHOULD NOT MAKE THAT CHANGE AT ALL IF THIS POINT HAD BEEN STARTED IN OUR LATE KING JAMESS TIME I DESIRE YOUR LORDSHIP TO CONSIDER WITH WHAT FACE IT WOULD HAVE LOOKED AND IF THE MASK BE TAKEN OFF THE FACE IS STILL THE SAME I FIND IT WAS STARTED IN THE TIME OF OUR CIVIL WARS ABOUT THE YEAR 1644 BY THOSE ABOUT THE KING WHEN OXFORD WAS THE KINGS HEADQUARTERS BUT THE PROJECT DID NOT THEN SUCCEED BY REASON THAT THE KINGS PARTY IN THAT CONTEST WERE NOT REVALENT AND YOUR LORD SHIP KNOWS VERY WELL HOW MUCH IT WAS TO THE PREJU DICE OF THE KINGS CAUSE THAT THOSE ON THE OTHER SIDE WOULD SUPPOSE HIM TO BE TOO MUCH INFLUENCED BY POPISH COUNCILS OF WHICH THIS WAS A GREAT INSTANCE AND NO DOUBT THEY WILL BE AS READY TO PUSH IT FORWARD UPON ANY THE LEAST PRETENCE WHENEVER THEY FIND US SOFT ENOUGH TO RECEIVE THE IMPRESSION NOT PERHAPS UNDER THE NAMES OF JULIAN AND GREGORIAN FOR THE WORD GREGORIAN SPEAKS TOO PLAIN BUT UNDER THE SOFTER TERMS OF OLD AND NEW STILE OTHERWISE SO MUCH WEIGHT WOULD NOT BE LAID UPON SO SLIGHT A PRETENCE FOR THE ADDITION OF OLD STILE OR NEW STILE WILL CERTAINLY DETERMINE THE DIFFERENCE OF ELEVEN DAYS IN THE NEXT CENTURY AS OF TEN IN THIS IF NOTHING ELSE WERE IN THE WIND WE HAVE BEEN TOO OFTEN CAUGHT IN SUCH SNARES I FORBEAR TO SAY MORE THOUGH MORE MIGHT BE SAID THAT I MAY NOT TOO MUCH PRESUME ON YOUR LORDSHIPS LEISURE BUT AM MY LORD YOUR LORDSHIPS VERY HUMBLE SERVANT JOHN WALLIS THE

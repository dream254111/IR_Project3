j100168,Harvard Law Review,1324478,The Proposed Patent Law Revision,i256970,HARVARD LAW REVIEW THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION ON the eve of the adjournment of Congress on August 8 I9I2 the Committee on Patents reported back to the House of Representatives the Oldfield Revision and Codification of the Patent Statutes 1 with an amendment in the nature of a substitute and recommended that this substitute be passed The committees purpose expressed by its chairman who is also the author of the bill was to give everybody an opportunity to study the question and give the people of the country the opportunity to see what is provided for in the bill and ascertain what is the sentiment of the country upon the proposal  2 and then to press the bill for passage in the session beginning in December 1912 During the spring of 1912 hearings were held for several weeks by the Committees on Judiciary and on Patents of the House of Representatives upon various proposals to amend the patent laws The opportunity for persons other than the sponsors of the proposed legislation to learn of these hearings and to attend them was necessarily limited and even among those who at tended their importance was probably not fully realized For no one could then have anticipated that practically all of the changes advanced in these proposals would be combined in the substitute bill to be reported Nevertheless witnesses testified written com munications were received and suggestions came from practically every part of the country 3 We had before us said the chair man of the Committee on Patents manufacturers of patented articles from almost every state in the Union and we had promi nent inventors and prominent patent attorneys before us 4 But out of the sixty persons whose testimony and communications were reported in these hearings less than half a dozen favored the proposals which have been embodied in the bill recommended5 1 H R 23417 2 Congressional Record Aug 8

manufacturers inventors and representatives of commercial and scientific associations ap pearing before the Committee on Patents in opposition to the orig inal bill reappear in the substitute In addition the substitute contains a number of provisions extending the application of the Sherman AntiTrust Act wherever patents are involved to specific transactions which are not now covered by that act and which if no patents were involved would under the existing law or even under the other provisions of the substitute bill lie outside the prohibition of the Sherman AntiTrust Act These were not con templated in the original Oldfield bill were neither discussed nor suggested by anyone upon the hearings and were not foreshadowed by any patent legislation previously introduced in either branch of Congress In scheme they somewhat resemble the proposed amendments to the Sherman AntiTrust Act introduced earlier in the session by Senator La Follette and Representative Lenroot6 except that their bills avowedly applied to all articles of commerce patented as well as unpatented while the substitute Oldfield bill by limiting its application exclusively to patented articles dis criminates grossly in favor of unpatented articles The three main proposals of the bill are briefly these Compulsory licenses are authorized by providing 7 that if any applicant shall establish in a federal district

REVIEW person from using the patented process more than three years after the patent is issued the court shall order the patent owner to grant to the applicant a license to use the invention upon such terms or royalty as the court deems just The nonenforcement of license restrictions is secured by provid ing 8 that the patent owner shall no longer be permitted to bring an action for infringement of the patent when the purchaser lesse or licensee of the patented article has committed a breach of the contract of sale lease or license by the conditions of which he ob tained the patented article The extension of the Sherman AntiTrust Act is effected by providing 9 that any patent used as part of any combination in restraint of trade or commerce among the several states or with foreign nations or to monopolize or in any attempt to monopolize such trade or used in any manner prohibited by this act may be condemned in the manner provided by law for the forfeiture seizure and condemnation of property illegally imported and also by providing 10 that a violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act shall be conclusively presumed from any one of a long list of the most common business transactions regardless of any surrounding circumstances11 8 Section 2 9 Section 4 10 Section 5 11 Thus a violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act shall be conclusively presumed a When the vendor of any patented article attempts to restrict the price at which such article may be resold b When the vendor of any patented article attempts to restrain a customer from buying or using an article obtained from somebody else whether such attempt be made by agreement against such purchase or by a condition of sale of the patented article sold or by making in the price of the patented article any discrimination based upon whether the customer buys the article from somebody else c When the vendor of any patented article with a view to preventing competi tion with such article acquires any other patent or license d When the vendor of any patented article with a view to restraining competition makes in the price of the patented article any discrimination other than the ordinary wholesale discount based upon whether the customer buys from him goods of a particular quantity or aggregate price e When the vendor of any patented article attempts to restrain competition either by refusing to supply somebody or by consenting to supply some body only upon terms or conditions less favorable than are accorded to anybody else f When the vendor of any patented article attempts to restrain competition by supplying to somebody in any particular territory patented articles upon terms or conditions more favorable than are accorded to other customers g When the vendor of any patented article attempts to restrain competition by making any arrangement under which he shall not sell such patented article to certain classes of persons or to those doing business in certain territory k When the person dealing in any patented I30THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION The provocation for these radical innovations and sweeping changes according to the report accompanying the bill12 was First The evils arising from the vendor of a patented article fixing the price at which the article must be resold to the public Second The evils arising from the vendors of patented articles prohibiting their use except in connection with other unpatented arti cles purchased from them article does business under any name other than his own or that of his firm or corpora tion i When the vendor of any patented article attempts to prevent competition by supplying such article at a price at or below the cost of production and distribution The bill makes these further provisions Whenever a combination in violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act is shown to control any patented article reasonably required in manufacture production general consumption or use and no ade quate opportunity exists to immediately substitute another article therefor of equal utility the court shall compel the patent owner to continue to supply the patented article until some other adequate substitute can be provided upon payment of either a reasonable compensation to be fixed by the court or the amount of com pensation payable according to any valid contract then existing section 6 Final judgment in a civil proceeding that a defendant has violated the Sherman AntiTrust Act by the use of any patent in any manner hereinbefore prohibited shall constitute as against such defendant conclusive evidence of the same facts and as to the same issues of law in favor of any other party in any other proceeding involving the Sher man AntiTrust Act section 7 Whenever a defendant has been adjudged in a civil proceeding to have violated the Sherman AntiTrust Act by the use of any patent in any manner hereinbefore prohibited anybody claiming to have been injured by such conduct may within three years thereafter intervene and shall be admitted as a party to the suit and shall have judgment for the damages resulting from such injury in just the same manner and extent as if he had begun an independent suit to recover such damages section g When a combination has used any patent in any manner hereinbefore prohibited and has been adjudged to have violated the Sherman Anti Trust Act the court may partition its property in severalty among groups of stock holders or sell it in parcels as a whole and forbid former stockholders to buy at such sale section 9 Whenever it appears in a civil suit by the federal government under the Sherman AntiTrust Act that a patent has been used in any manner hereinbefore prohibited any person or state threatened with injury may at any time intervene as a party section io Whenever it is alleged in an action by the federal government under the Sherman AntiTrust Act that a patent has been used in any manner here inbefore prohibited no department or official of the United States shall contract to buy anything from the defendant or its subsidiaries until such allegation be found on final decree to be unfounded unless no substitute of equal utility at a reasonable price can be found section ii In any suit arising out of the infringement of any patent or the breach of any contract whatsoever it shall be a complete defense that the plaintiff or the real party in interest at the time of the making of such contract or of its alleged breach or at the time of the alleged infringement at the time of the be ginning of said suit was engaged in carrying on business in any manner or to any extent in violation of the provisions of this act section I2 12 Report p 2 I3IHRARVARD LAW REVIEW Third The evils arising from owners of patents suppressing the same or prohibiting their use in order to prevent competition with other patented or unpatented articles sold by such owners of patents As a remedy for these evils it was proposed to limit the absolute right now vested in the owners of patents under which they deter mine to what extent and in what manner the use of the patent or patented article shall be permitted With this in view it was pro posed to take away specifically the right recognized by the lower federal courts to fix under the patent law prices at which articles shall be sold at retail and also to take away the right recently confirmed in the Mimeograph Case to prohibit patented machines from being used otherwise than in connection with unpatented materials furnished by the vendor or licensor 13 Whether these evils are actual and whether the proposed changes in the patent law will bring any remedy or advantage were the questions to which discussion was exclusively directed in the hearings upon the original Oldfield bill in which the over whelming number of witnesses opposed the conclusions of the committee Before turning to this testimony the fundamental rights of a patent owner under the laws of the United States may be briefly stated Congress has the power under Article I section 8 of the Con stitution to promote the progress of science and useful arts by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries Pursuant to this power Congress has provided in section 4884 of the Revised Statutes that a patent owner shall have the ex clusive right to make use and vend the invention or discovery As the phraseology of the statute indicates this exclusive right consists of three components i e the exclusive right to make the exclusive right to use and the exclusive right to vend the patented article The owner of these three exclusive rights may dispose of them singly or together or fractionally If he wishes to manu facture the patented article himself he may keep the exclusive right to make and dispose simply of the exclusive rights to use and to vend If he wishes to manufacture the patented article and put 13 Report p 2 132THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION it out only upon some basis which will continue the title in him self he may keep the exclusive rights to make and to vend and dispose simply of the right to use This right of use he may dis pose of entirely or partially according as he wishes Thus he may keep the exclusive rights to make and to vend and most of the exclusive right to use and grant only a limited right of use for instance the right to use the patented article only with such supplies and accessory appliances and only under such conditions in respect to sale lease license and use as the patent owner shall prescribe14 The patent owner like the owner of any other property can not be compelled to part with his own excepting on inducements to his liking 15 Owners of unimproved land cannot be compelled to improve their property nor  except by eminent domain to allow others to improve it Similarly the patent owner cannot be compelled to use his invention nor except by eminent do main  to allow others to use it Landowners frequently prefer to continue to be owners and to keep the rights of ownership and to allow to others only the partial use of their land subject to conditions of lease Even when disposing of most of their rights of ownership landowners frequently convey a limited title subject to restrictions regarding the character of the improvements that shall be erected or the use to which the property shall be put The patent owners rights are neither greater nor more unusual than these familiar rights of landowners When therefore the patent owner requires that his property be used only under cer tain specified conditions and for certain specified purposes and with certain specified accessories he asserts no novel property rights Indeed the patent owners rights are much curtailed as contrasted with the rights of other property owners in that the owners of every other form of property may exercise their rights for so long a period 14

of his rights beyond the duration of his patent and at the expiration of the statutory period of seventeen years must relinquish to the public all of his rights1 These rights have always been fundamental in American patent law The right to fix under the patent law prices at which ar ticles shall be sold at retail which the committee describes as recognized by the lower federal courts 17 has been settled by the decisions of the Circuit Courts of Appeals of the Third Seventh and Eighth Circuits 18 and by decisions of Circuit Courts of the First Second Third Sixth and Eighth Circuits 19 and has been expressly affirmed by the Supreme Court20 It rests upon principles estab lished by an unbroken line of judicial decisions in theUnited States21 The same right and the same principles it

used other wise than in connection with unpatented materials furnished by himself was strictly in line with all these authorities Far from being a recent development the rule in that case was simply an application of the principles established by the unbroken trend of judicial decisions above mentioned How unchallenged these principles have been until the surprising dissenting opinion in the Mimeograph Case appears from the decisions of the Supreme Court in United States v Bell Telephone Co25 and Bement v National Harrow Co26 and the Paper Bag Patent Case27 in which it is interesting to note the author of this dissenting opinion par ticipated and concurred Notwithstanding the forebodings ex pressed in this dissenting opinion a careful reading of the decision itself shows that the Mimeograph Case spells trouble only for those people who with knowledge of the conditions on which alone the patent owner consents to part with his patented article expressly agree to these conditions in order to obtain the article and there upon deliberately set about to violate their agreement respecting these conditions in order to benefit at the expense of the patent owner or those people who fully knowing that a user of a patented article has expressly agreed to the conditions on which alone the patent owner consented to part with it thereupon deliberately instigate such user to break his agreement respecting these condi tions in order to benefit at the expense of the patent owner As Justice Wills remarked speaking to this very point in one of the English cases above referred to It seems to be common sense and not to depend upon any patent law or any other particular law 28 The substitute Oldfield bill proposes to deprive the patent owner of the right to sue such pirating dealers and manufactur ers as contributory infringers and to relegate the patent owner to separate actions for breach of contract against the army of small users whom these pirates instigate to break their agree 24 Report p 2 25 167 U S 224 I897 26 186 U S 70 I902 27 Continental Paper Bag Co v Eastern Paper Bag Co 210 U S 405 I908 28 Incandescent Gas Light Co Ltd v Cantello 12 Pat Cas 262 I895 approved and followed in National Phonograph Co of Australia Ltd v Menck I9II A C 336 I35HARVARD LAW REVIEW ments This proposal leaves the patent owner virtually without remedy Even if a thousand such suits were successfully prose cuted the damages would be small in each and uncollectable in most and less than the expense of litigation in all Meanwhile the patent owner would practically be helpless before the instiga tor of this piracy The evils which the House Committee on Patents declare to be their provocation for sweeping away all these patent rights were not established by the testimony taken before the committee By numerous witnesses who cited scores of examples it was shown that the difficulties of merchandizing are enormously in creased in the instance of novelties All patented articles are novelties at first and most of them continue to be novelties to most of the public until the seventeenyear patent period expires Considering the natural handicap thus imposed on the selling of patented articles and the further fact that the patent owner must reap his reward before the expiration of the seventeenyear patent period no aid which the existing law lends to the merchandizing of patented articles can well be called unfair In his evidence Mr Louis D Brandeis says  The fixing of a price has possibly prevented one retail dealer from selling the article a little lower than the other but the fixing of that price has tended not to suppress but to develop competition because it has made it possible in the distribution of those goods to go to an expense and to open up another sphere of merchandizing which would have been absolutely impossible without a fixed price The whole world can be drawn into the field Every dealer every small stationer every small druggist every small hardware man can be made a purveyor of that article by comprehensive advertising You have stimulated through the fixed price the little man as against the department store and as against the large unit which may other wise monopolize that trade  As you develop the article you are inciting invention and what is more important than the invention you are inciting the commercial development of the competing article29 29 Hearing before the Committee on Patents House of Representatives on H R 234I7 hereinafter called Hearing No XVIII p 4 To the same effect see also the testimony of Fletcher B Gibbs representing the National Catalogue Committee I36THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION By the same token license restrictions agreed to by owners when they obtain patented articles solely upon condition that they use them only with supplies that are specially prepared for them or in continuity with machines that are especially adapted to them or in some particular manner requisite in order to accomplish the purposes for which they are intended were declared by numerous witnesses to be both necessary and proper Mr H Ward Leonard a wellknown inventor and an officer of the Inventors Guild made this explanation It may be that the article is of such nature that in order that it shall work properly it shall require very great care in selecting cer tain conditions of use certain materials to be used in connection with it It certainly is a fact that in some instances a mans mar ket for a good article would be completely destroyed if he could not insure himself in seeing that it was properly used after it left his hands30 The notion that such license restrictions might give patent owners the practical monopoly of the market for unpatentable products used with a patented device is disposed of by the fact that such a practical monopoly far from offending the public policy actually promotes the general welfare because the patent owners can attain it only by cheapening the cost of manufacture of the patented article and can continue it only so long as their in of the National Association of Stationers and Manufacturers and of Frank L

his machine i e the patent owners patented ma chine which by such a condition he takes to himself was a market which he alone created by the making and selling of a new invention Had he kept his invention to himself no ink could have been sold by others for use upon machines embodying that invention By selling it subject to the restriction he took nothing from others and in no wise restricted their legitimate market    The public is always free to take or refuse the patented article on the terms imposed If they be too onerous or not in keeping with the benefits the patented invention will not find a market The public by permitting the in vention to go unused loses nothing which it had before and when the patent expires will be free to use the invention without compen sation or restriction 33 Thus are the first and second classes of evils relied upon by the committee proved unreal upon analysis The third class of evils by which the committee seeks to justify the substitute Old field bill are evils arising from owners of patents suppressing the same or prohibiting their use in order to prevent competi tion with other patented or unpatented articles sold by such owners of patents 34 That patents in the United States are bought up in large num bers for the purpose of suppressing competition continues the committee cannot be doubted 5 Significantly enough the committee cites no testimony that supports this statement In deed as an eminent patent lawyer told the committee upon the close of the hearings There is not a particle of evidence before the committee there is

the committee goes outside of the testimony for proof of suppression and declares It has been the subject of comment and complaint in the public press for years Moreover many instances can be found in the reports of the decisions of the federal courts 37 Quoting from Columbia Wire Co v Freeman Wire Co38 the committee says regarding one of the parties liti gant It has become possessed of many if not all of the valuable patents for the manufacture of barbed wire and machines for so doing But the remainder of the sentence and the context flatly disprove every suggestion of suppression either of patents or of competition What the court says is It has become possessed of many if not all of the valuable patents for the manufacture of barbed wire and the machines for so doing and has granted a large number of licenses to persons and corporations under its said patents The evidence further shows that it has not bound its licensees to any prices or in any manner limited or restricted their sales or output  In other words there ap pears to be so far as the complainants licensees are concerned unre stricted competition in the sale of their products Indiana Mfg Co v J I Case Threshing

contrary to the Sherman AntiTrust Act and the court of course held that it was Far from indorsing the objects of the substitute Oldfield bill the court in this case emphatically dissents from the

of property The Paper Bag Patent Case 4 from which the committee quotes the opinion of a dissenting circuit judge4 who differed from the majority of his colleagues and from the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States is described by the committee as the best known instance in the reports of suppression of a patent to prevent competition46 This admission is important because this case as the Supreme Court pointed out in its decision47 is a clear instance not of the wilful suppression of a patent but simply of the rejection of one invention and the use of a better invention accomplishing the same purpose more satisfactorily48 The conclusion of the committee therefore that these citations are sufficient to show that the practice of buying up and suppressing patents is widely indulged in49 does not seem warranted50 Equally 44 Continental Paper Bag Co v Eastern Paper Bag Co 150 Fed 741 I906 2Io U S 405 I908 46 Report pp 56 4 Report p 5 47 Pp 427429 48 One of the witnesses before the committee referring particularly to this case explained this point Let us take the extreme case said he of which I do not think there are many instances A man has two patents each of which is complete in itself and each of which is operative He knows because he studies the art that one is better than the other That is substantially the Paper Bag Case where the plain tiff was making firstclass machines under one patent and held another patent which he was not using and which we will assume was radically independent of the one under which he worked His machines were making exactly the same paper bags which could have been made by machines built under the other patent He spent very likely hundreds of thousands of dollars in the development of the machine he was using He gives the public the article that they want made on machines built under the patent which he uses I say that under those circumstances there is abso lutely no reason based upon public policy why that man should not hold this second patent which he is not using for the sake of protecting him in the use of his first idea That would give him the monopoly of the manufacture of one particular kind of paper bags only and perhaps not of that There are many kinds of paper bags in competition with each other the patentees and manufacturers of today are trying to find the best machines for making them It may be that he invented the second patent in his own factory If he purchased it his object very likely was that he might have this other way of making these same bags so that if this other way turned out to be a better way he might use it If in the course of time this second invention appears to be the better way he wil use it Frederick P Fish Hearing No XXVI pp 9 io 49 Report p 5 0 Before taking leave of this point it may not be amiss to quote the testimony of two witnesses the first a leader of the patent bar who has appeared in most of the patent cases before the Supreme Court in recent years and the second the greatest I40THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION untenable appears the contention that the aggregation of patents under single ownership is an oppressive monopoly which should be forbidden This contention was disposed of by the Court of Appeals of the Seventh Circuit in reversing one of the identical cases cited by the committee6 Their contention comes to this If he owned either alone over that he would have complete dominion owning both he controls nothing The public has no right in either invention therefore the public has the right to have them both in the market competing for buyers Naught plus naught the sum of the two naughts is a sub stantive quantity The value of the comment and complaint in the public press which the committee mentions as proving the suppression of in vention does not merit serious discussion Not a single instance of such comment and complaint is specified in the committees re port I wanted declared the chairman when he presented the report to the House52 to get up as good a report as we could to make it as plain as possible Since this is the best showing the committee can make in respect to suppression of inventions it is not presumptuous to affirm that present conditions require no change in the patent law upon this point inventor of the age I persbnally cannot think of an instance in my career of a meri torious patent being suppressed says Frederick P Fish I have known of the charge but have in every case known that it was unfounded Hearing No XXVI p 13 I have heard and read numerous statements that many corporations buy valuable inventions says Thomas A Edison but no one cites specific cases I myself do not know of a single case There may be cases where a firm or corporation has bought up an invention introduced it and afterwards bought up an improvement and ceased using the first patent  suppressed it in fact Why should that not be done It is for the benefit of the public that it should get the latest improvement I cannot see why the public should be asked to change the patent law to enable a competitor to get hold of the disused patent so he could have a basis on which to enter into compe tition with the pioneer of the invention who has introduced an improved machine Before any changes in the law are made let the objectors cite instances where injustice has been worked to the public by the alleged suppression of patents for other reasons than those which were due to improvements Hearing XXIII p 34 The dis tinction thus drawn by Mr Edison between the wilful suppression of inventions and the rejection of inventions after careful experimentation and trial in favor of the use of better and more useful inventions which accomplish the same purpose more satis factorily must be firmly kept in mind in order to judge the situation fairly 51 Indiana Mfg Co v J I Case Threshing Machine Co 154 Fed 365 371 o906 52 Congressional Record Aug 8 1912 p 11333 I4IHARVARD LAW REVIEW Much solicitude is evinced by the committee lest the existing patent laws enable owners of patents to withdraw a large amount of personal property from the control of the state courts and state legislatures53 Nothing is more fundamental in our govern ment declares the committee than the clearly marked line be tween the jurisdiction of the state and of the federal courts 54 Nevertheless the committee recommends a scheme of compulsory license which gives every federal district court throughout the United States power to hale before it every patent owner except ing original inventors whose invention for any reason whatsoever has not come into use within three years after the issuance of the patent and thereupon judicially to determine its value and compel the patent owner to grant to any competitor who asks it a license to use the patent upon such terms as the court may fix This would transform the seventytwo federal district courts into courts of patent commerce to quote one of the witnesses before the committee It embraces collar buttons and steamships toothbrushes and transportation systems toilet articles and safetyappliance systems telegraph systems and tools articles that go on the tables of the people garments and foodstuffs patent roads and buildings inven tions which have a restricted use in special fields and those which affect the great mass In short so sweeping are the powers created by the proposed law as to give the district federal courts jurisdiction over all fields of commerce 55 How the committee reconciles such a proposal with its professed abhorrence of anything that may ignore and override the jurisdic tion of the state courts 56 it is difficult to conceive Economists have long recognized that all the appalling conse quences of overpopulation and starvation conditions have been staved off in the United States during the past twenty years only by the progress of invention57 The result of such a scheme of 53 Report p Io 4

general prosperity It has been due to two causes acting together and both of them must continue to act if we are destined to escape disaster The first is production on a vast scale carrying with it a corresponding increase of efficiency and the second is improvement in productive I42THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION compulsory license it was graphically shown before the committee would be to diminish the inventors market for his invention to enable any strong competitor to crush its weak rivals to impede every patent owner in developing and introducing his invention to retard the patenting of inventions and to discourage the large scale invention and industrial experimentation on which civiliza tion depends for solving the increasing problems of existence58 In its zeal to insure the nonenforcement of license restrictions the committee proposes by the substitute Oldfield bill to enforce solely against patent owners a Draconian code of business practice which is not and never has been imposed upon any other class of property owners Litigation under the Sherman AntiTrust Act turns frequently if not generally upon close questions of law By a salutary result of the existing law property which is not in transit does not become forfeited in the event that a combination in restraint of trade is found to exist The substitute Oldfield bill however provides that under such circumstances all property in the form of patents involved in such litigation shall be forfeited while all other forms of property shall remain unaffected Under the provisions of the bill the vendor of any patented article becomes a criminal if he attempts to secure a years business as a condition of selling to a retailer if he attempts to hold the retailer to his agreement to buy his patented goods exclusively or to a certain method  the brilliant succession of mechanical invention and other devices which in every field of industry have accomplished again and again what is called making two blades of grass grow where one grew before    Technical improvement is highly indispensable Without it and with our increasing population life on our planet would be unendurable Stop the succession of inventions that add to our power over nature and you will bring labor soon to a starvation limit Merely check the rapidity of this technical progress and you will cause grievous hardship

extent if he attempts to hold the retailer to his agreement to main tain a standard price on the patented goods if he licenses the use of a delicate patented machine on condition that it be used only with specially prepared supplies or in continuity with specially adapted machinery necessary to insure perfect operation if he avails himself of the quality of his patented inventions to induce licensees to use his machines either exclusively or in part for all their needs if he agrees with a retailer in a town to sell his pat ented goods to no one else in the same town or to sell to other re tailers only on less favorable terms in consideration of which the retailer shall push the sale of the goods or if he sells his patented goods in any particular territory at a less price than he sells else where Each of these transactions which good morals and honor able business practice today and from time immemorial have always sanctioned is made by the bill conclusive proof of the violation of the Sherman AntiTrust Act The fact that the trans actions might reasonably be shown to have no tendency to restrain trade cannot save the unlucky patent owner for the bill expressly provides that restraint shall be conclusively deemed to have been or to be unreasonable and to be in violation of the provisions of said act 59 i e the Sherman AntiTrust Act as to any party who per forms any of these transactions The penalty which the patent owner may suffer for doing any of these things is the forfeiture of his patents a fine of five thousand dollars and a years imprison ment and the payment of threefold damages and the costs of suit and attorneys fees to anyone who comes in within three years there after and proves any damage The substitute Oldfield bill forbids only patent owners to do these things and expressly leaves the owners of every other form of property absolutely free to do any of them Unlucky patent owners caught in the net may reflect that if they had only dealt in unpatented goods instead of spending time and money developing new inventions which their patents publish to the world to the end that in seventeen years the world may use them without cost they could have avoided all their misfortunes Is this the way by which Congress seeks to promote the progress of science and useful arts 69 Section 5 144THE PROPOSED PATENT LAW REVISION Some amendments in the patent law are certainly needed Few will disagree with the House Committee on Patents that some legislation other than that proposed in the substitute Oldfield bill is required amendments specifically in the patent law and particularly some radical changes in the administration of the patent law both in the courts and in the Patent Office 60 The committee continues As respects the courts two vital changes are essential  the present method of trying patent cases must be abandoned for a new one and a court of patent appeals must be established  Changes should be made in the equipment and organization of the Patent Office to increase its efficiency and to secure for the public and inventors whom it serves the best possible service 61 By changes of this sort rather than by the radical innovations proposed in the substitute Oldfield bill will the patent system of the United States be improved Gilbert H Montague NEW YORK CITr 61 Report pp 21 23 24 I45 60 Report p

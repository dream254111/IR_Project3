Abstract,i207050,451I April 30 1857 The LORD WROTTESLEY President in the Chair The following commuinication was read Inquilies into the Quantity of Air inspired throuighout the Day and Night anid unider the influence of Exercise Food Medicine Temperature c By EDWARD SMITH MD LLB LRCP Assist Physician to the Hospital for Consumptioln and Diseases of the Chest B3romptoni Com municated by Dr CARPENTER FRS Received March 19 1857 Abstract This communication consists of three parts and contains the results of 1200 series of observations In the first part is contained the results of three inivestigations as to the quantity of air breathed during the whole of the 24 hours and registered every 5 15 and 30 minutes The second part describes the influence of posture varioius kinds of exercise physical agents and different articles of food and medicine on the quantity of air breathed and on the frequency of the respiration alnd pulse The third part is devoted to certain inquiries in relation to the temperature of the body The author was himself the subject of all the investigations He is thirtyeight years of age six feet in height healthy and strong and with a vital capacity of the lungs of 280 cubic inches The instrument employed was Glovers patent dry gas meter of improved maniufacture and arranged to register from 1 to 1000000 cub ins Its action was reversed so as to measure inspiration An orinasal mouthpiece was employed and it was connected with the spirometer by vulcanized caoutchouc tubing and could be fastened upon the head by elastic straps The determiniatioll of the quantity of air inspired in the 24 houls was effected by three inquiries 1st by using the spirometer whilstin the quiet sitting posture during five minutes at the comnmencement of each quarter of an hour from 5 AM to 64 PM and of each half lhour from 64 PM to 34 AM Exercise was taken in the intervals and food was eaten at 84 AM 1 54 and 84 PM 2ndly by using the spirometer without intermission during the whole of the 24 hours except at ilntervals amountinig collectively to 40 minutes The pos ture exercise and periods of sleep were noticed and recorded and the quanitity of air inispired was read off at the end of evlery five minutes 3rdly by an inquiry similar to the seconicd hut continiued througlh the night onlyl from 6PiM to 56 AM the quantity being recorded every quarter of an hour The first inquiry was made ont July 7 alnd 8 1856 the second on January 19 and 20 1857 anli the third on January 21 1857 The maximum influelnce of various agelnts was determined both by the quantity of air inspired taken absolutely anid also relatively to that recorded immediately before the influence in question was exerted The inquiries were made before breakfast or at periods distant at least thlree hours from the last meal so as to avoid the disturbing influenice of food Exertion variation of posture mental inquietude clhange of temperature c were avoided during tlle continuance of each inquiiry and heince the observations were never continued beyolnd a period of two hours The quantity of air was determined duiring periods of five minutes at a time twice during the first quarter of an hour anid once at the commencement of each suc ceeding quarter of ani hour The results were averaged per minute In all the abovementioned ilnquiries the rate of respiration and pulsation and the temperature of the wet and dry bulbs with the barometric pressure were recorded The temperature of the breath was determitned by the aid of an instruiment consistilng of a boxwood tube 43 of an inch in diameter alnd 14 inch in length through the sides of which and at a right angle to it a small thermometer was inserted and the bulb exposed freely to the exhaled breath A valve was placed at the distal end which permitted the exit of the breath but prevented the enitrance of air whilst lnear to the elnd which was placed between the lips wheln in use a valve was fixed which muoved in botlh directions The bulb of the thermometer was thus enclosed in a small chamber The paper concludes with a suLmmmary of the principal rcsults ob453 tained and a series of deductions applicable especially to the solution or elucidation of hygienlic questionis From the former the following facts are extracted  The total quantity of air inspired in 24 hours allowance being made for intervals amounting altogether to 40 minutes during which it was not recorded was 711060 cub ins  or an average of 29627 cub ins per hour and 493 6 per minute The quantity was mnuch less during the night than during the day There was an increase as the morning advaniced and a decrease at about 8h 30 PM but most suddenly at about 11 Pm During the day the quantity increased immediately after a meal anid then subsided before the lnext meal but irn every instanice it rose again immediately before a mneal The rate of frequenicy of respiration generally corresponded with the quantity but the extremes of the day and night rates were greater The period of greatest parallelism was between tea and supper An increase was occasioned by one meal only namely break fast The average depth of respiration was 26 5 cub ins with a minimum of 18 1 cub inls in the night and a maxinmum of 322 cub ins at Ih 30 PM The mean rate of the pulse was 76 per miniute the minimum at 3 30 AM the maximum at 8h 45 AM the dif ference being more thani onethird of the minimum rate Sleep came on in two of the series of continuous observations and the time of its occurrence was also that of the lowest quiantities of air inspired The amounit of breathing was greater in the standing than in the sitting posture and greater sitting than lying It was increased by riding on horseback according to the pace also by ridiiig in or upon an omnibus In railway travelling the increase was greater in a second than in a firstclass carriage and greatest in the tllirdclass and on the engine Aln increase was also produced by rowing swimming walking running carrying weights ascending and de scending steps and the labour of the treadwheel and in several of these cases the rate of increase was determined for different degrees of exertion used Reading aloud and singinig and the movemelt recommended by Dr Hall for restoring suspended respiration in creased the quantity bending forwards whilst sitting lessened it The quaantity of inspired air was increased by exposuLre to the heat anid light of the sun and lessened in darkness Increase and dlecrease of artificial heat produtced corresponding effects and the454 depth of respiration was greatly increased by great heat An in crease in quantity was caused also by cold bathiiig and sponging and the cold showerbath by breakfast dinner and teawhen tea actually was taken but when coffee was substituted there was a decrease Supper of bread and milk also caused a decrease Milk by itself or with suet caused an increase An increase was obtained with the following articles of diet viz eggs beefsteak jelly white bread homemade oatmeal potatoes sugar tea rum 1 oz The following caused a decrease viz butter fat of beef olive oil codliver oil arrowroot brandy 1 oz to 15 oz and kirchenwasser Ether 2 drachm increased the quantity and depth of inspiration A decrease in quantity was caused by sp ammon co 3iss sp ammon fcet 5iss tincture of opium 20 mj morphia I and I gr tartarized antimony I gr and chloride of sodium Carbonate of amnonia 15 grains caused a small increase at first and then a smnall decrease febrifuge medicines had a like effect Chloroform 25 11 and 3ss by the stomach varied the quantity from an average increase of 28 cub ins to ala average decrease of 20 cub ins per minute with a maximum increase of 63 cub ins per minute Chloric ether 5ss also varied the quantity but there was an average increase of 17 cub ins per minute and of 18 per minute in the rate whilst the pulse fell on the average I 7 per min Chloroform by inhalation to just short of unconsciousness lowered the quantity a little during the inhalation and more so afterwards The rate was unchanged but the pulse fell on an average 117 per min Amylene similarly administered and to the same degree increased the quantity during inhalation 60 cub ins per min but afterwards decreased it to 100 cub ins per min less than during the inhalation The rate of respiration was unchanged the pulse fell 6 per min at the end of the observation Digitalis infusion gi varied the quantity increasing it at first and then decreasilng it The rate of inspiration was unaffected whilst that of pulsation somewhat increased The paper is accompanied by tables of lnumerical statements and by diagrams exhibiting the results in a series of curves

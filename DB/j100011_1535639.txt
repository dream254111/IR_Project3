BITTACOMORPHA is a member of a very aberrant group of Tipulidae In connection with two other genera it has been separated from the Tipulidae and considered as a distinct family Of the genus Bittacomorpha only two species are known both from North America The species upon which these remarks are based is the commoner and more widely distributed form It occurs from the New England states westward to the Pacific coast and has been taken as far south as Florida by Osten Sacken In the northern states it is double brooded and the imagines are seen during May and September although much more commonly in the spring The other species Sackenii which was described by Von Roeder in I8902 is much more limited in its distribution and is recorded only from Nevada The common species Fig 3 is of the very slender form so characteristic of the Tipulidae Its appearance is remarkable however on account of the peculiar black and white banding and the great inflation of the metatarsi of all the legs The preparatory stages of a European species of the closely allied genus Ptychoptera have long been known but it was only very recently that the larva and pupa of Bittacomorpha clavipes were discovered and figured by Hart3 The larva like that of Ptychoptera is aquatic living among the submerged brushwood and sticks which it resembles in color and external appearance It is in this instar that we find the first peculiar modification of the tracheal system The larva is furnished with an elon 1 Contributions from the Zoological Laboratory of the University of Texas under the direction of

I This formation is not peculiar to this species as it occurs elsewhere even in insects in nowise related as in Eristalis among the Syrphidae In the pupa we find a respiratory tube present but in this instar its insertion is exactly reversed it proceeds from the head Although only one tube is functionally developed it is one of a pair which has lengthened at the expense of its fel low Fig 2 Moreover it is not always the same tube which is developed Hart mentions that twentyseven pupae had the right tube elongated as against three in which the left tube functioned In one anomalous case both were developed but unequally their combined length being equal to that of the long one in normal pupae This unequal length of the tubes is characteristic also of Ptycoptera Up to the present time it has not been known that the imago also possesses a remarkable modification of the tracheal system In this stage however it is to be found in the legs In both sexes the metatarsi are very much enlarged and quite conspicuous on account of their great color contrast The second and third tarsal joints are also somewhat enlarged but not nearly to so great an extent In order to study the tracheal system of the legs they were decolorized in chlorine water and mounted whole or split into halves Some specimens were treated also with potassium hydroxide which successfully separated the delicate tracheae from the integument Legs were also sectioned in paraffin to show the disposition of the internal parts In the basal part of the legs the tracheal tube is of the ordi nary form and size It begins to enlarge just before the mid dle of the femur and before it has reached the tip is equal to seveneighths the diameter of the femur At this point the taenidia extend entirely around the tube although faint in some places The whole tibia is completely filled up by the trachea which is striated on each side for only about one fifteenth of its circumference In the enlarged metatarsus the trachea is enormously distended and almost completely fills the cavity of this joint as well as that of the second and third I56 BRUES  VOL INo 3 BITTACOMORPHA CLAVIPES FABR I57 f 7 8

KCxIIUIjoints of the tarsus The wall of the trachea lies closely applied to the exoskeleton of the metatarsus except for a very short distance on one side of the leg where it is semicircu larly bent inward to leave space for the claw tendon which lies in the tubular space thus formed Fig 5 Here as in the tibia the taenidia are visible on only about onefifteenth of the cir cumference on each side The walls of the trachea are here not entirely destitute of taenidia as is the case with the air vesicles which appear in the body cavities of many active insects The striations have re mained on that part of the tracheal wall which encloses the tendon Fig 4 At the point where the tendon passes the taenidia are thickened and quite robust but on each side they gradually become weak and fade out entirely An exactly symmetrical formation of the taenidia is present on the side opposite to the tendon It is evident that the thickenings on the tendon side may have been retained in order to strengthen the tube at this point but there is apparently no reason for the anomalous thickening on the opposide side In the second and third joints the taenidia lengthen until they extend over oneseventh of the circumference The trachea seems to stop suddenly here as I have been unable to trace it further There are few insects presenting similar enlargements of the leg joints if we except those forms such as jumping Orthoptera and Chrysomelidae where the increase in size is evidently for the accommodation of the larger muscles Graber and Lub bock mention enlargements of the trachea in the tibiae of Orthoptera ants and Termitidae serving as auditory or chor dotonal organs In this case the adaptation is very extraor dinary but the dilatation of the trachea is not comparable to that of Bittacomorpha in extent Bittacomorpha presents the only case known to me of a considerable tracheal dilatation occurring in the insect leg In the males of many Empididae and notably species of Hilara eg Hilara trivittata Lw the metatarsus of the front leg is greatly enlarged Fig 7 but here the cavity is occupied in great part by muscular tissue the trachea being very slender Fig 8 In this species there seems to be no trachea beyond the end of the metatarsus 158 BR UES VOL INo 3 BITTACOMORPHA CLA VIPES FA BR In the legs of normal Tipulidae Pachyrrhina sp and sev eral other species the trachea occupies a considerable space only in the femur and tibia where it fills up from onefourth to onesixteenth of the cavity In the tarsus the tracheal tube is very delicate or obsolete The female of the peculiar parasitic hymenopteron Pele cinus polyturator Drury presents an external appearance simi lar to that of Bittacomorpha in the enlarged hind tibia Fig 6 Here however the mchitin of the external wall is thick and heavy and the trachea is robust strongly striated but not at all dilated It is the rule in insects wherever a tracheal dilation occurs that the taenidia become obsolete but the thinning of the tracheal wall can nearly always be regarded as a modification for the purpose of offering less resistance to osmosis This is illustrated by the air vesicles in the bodies of insects which are generally considered to be reservoirs for storing air to be used during extended muscular exertion The presence of these immense vesicles in the metatarsi cannot be explained on the same prin ciples for it is impossible that they should serve as reservoirs for air to be used in respiration on account of their distance from the body of the insect It is more probable that they may bear some relation to the insects method of locomotion When flying Bittacomorpha uses the wings scarcely at all relying in great measure upon wind currents for transportation The legs are exceedingly light as the exoskeleton is thin and delicate and encloses practically no tissue which can serve to increase their weight As they expose a large surface they offer great resistance to the air without adding appreciably to the insects weight Drifting along thus their extremely slender bodies and white banded appendages give them a most peculiar intangible ap pearance which is heightened by their extremely slow motion When examined in the cabinet the conspicuous white and black banding of Bittacomorpha seems to point toward a case of warning coloration When they are seen against their natural background however all these brilliant contrasts fade away into a perfectly neutral color which causes them to resem I59i60 BRUES ble a spiders web or thistle seed drifting along Indeed when I first saw them it was hard to believe that they were really alive Bittacomorpha seems to have developed its protective coloration along the same lines as the zebra among the verte brates it is rendered invisible not only by the fragmentary distribution of color but by the neutral gray color produced by the visual blending of the black and white From the description of Bittacomorpha Sackenii by Von Roeder it seems that this species does not possess any dilata tion of the metatarsi It would be very interesting to see if there is any abnormal development of the tracheal system in this species but unfortunately I have been unable to procure specimens The specimens examined were given to me by Dr Wm M Wheeler to whom I feel greatly indebted for many kind suggestions

create the offices of State Entomologist State Vegetable Pathologist and State Horticulturist and to appropriate a sum of money therefor The professors of ento mology vegetable pathology and horticulture of the Maryland Agricultural College and the Experiment Station shall be the State officers and the department shall be under the control of the State Agricultural College to whom the State officers shall be responsible Notice in writing of infection is to be given to owners and if not attended to after ten days the State officers shall act and the cost be added to the tax bill and collected as is other taxation All nurseries of the State are to be inspected at least once in six months and where found apparently free from insect pests and disease the owners shall be given certificates to such effect Both Entomologist and Pathologist must make an annual report of inspection to the Governor of the State this to be published as a Bulletin of the Experiment Station The ap propriation asked for carrying this into effect is 8000 for the first year and 6000 for each year after Attention was also called to the clause in the Game Law which will permi boys to shoot robins larks doves and flickers at any time and a resolution was unanimously adopted that members of the State Legislature be invoked to reject that section of the resolu tion which refers to these birds also that the insectivorous birds shall be named and their being killed or offered for sale shall be counted a misdemeanor and made punishable by fine The Electrical World gives a summary of a re port in the Elektrische Zeitschrift of the work in electricity of the German Reichsanstalt during the past two years Much work was done in connection with the standard ohm and this may now be considered concluded the determination of the ohm for that institution being now as sured Comparisons were made to determine the constancy of the wire and mercury secondary standards these have been repeatedly com pared and gave very good results as before those of wire are almost all of manganin and show that this material besides having a very small temperature coefficient has a very good N S VOL VII No 166 constancy and is therefore well suited for ex act measurements Under standard cells it is stated that both the Clark and Weston cells were carefully examined and the previous re sults were confirmed that the cells are constant and reproducible to 1 in 10000 the depend ence of the voltage of the cadmium cell on the composition of the amalgam was also investi gated also the effect of warming the cells An absolute determination of the Clark cell was made with the Helmholtz electrodynamom eter it being a repetition of the previous one the results differed by less than 1 in 1000 from the values obtained with the silver voltameter and showed that the absolute measurements of current agreed with those made by other methods The determination of the E M F of the Clark cell with the silver voltameter showed the difficulties involved and if these are not taken into account the results are un certain to 1 in 1000 The magnetization of iron and steel in weak fields was investigated and with annealed and hard cast steel and with cast iron a straight line relation was found while for hard and soft wrought iron the rela tion was not so simple The electric conduc tivity of solutions was also examined and the results show that the electric current is very suitable for scientific research with solutions and in chemistry being in some respects supe rior to other methods in analyses UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS UNIVERSITY Day at the University of Penn sylvania annually celebrated on Washingtons Birthday was this year the occasion of an ad dress by President McKinley who reviewed the services of Washington to the nation and to education and the importance of education to national life COMMEMORATION Day was also celebrated at Johns Hopkins University on Washingtons Birthday In the course of an address Presi dent Gilman said that in accordance with the wishes of many of its friends and supporters taxpayers and citizens of Maryland the Johns Hopkins University has decided to present a statement of its financial condition to the Legis lature of Maryland to ask for State aid Through the failure of the Baltimore and OhioMARCH 4 1898 SCIENCE Railroad as is well known the University has lost an income of 150000 from funds invested in the railroad by the late Johns Hopkins The sum of 250000 50000 per annum has been subscribed by friends of the University but in spite of this the University is seriously hampered by the loss of its former income THE new building erected for the Ohio Uni versity at Athens has just been completed It is a Tshaped structure having a front of 156 feet and a depth of 131 feet It contains an auditorium capable of seating about nine hun dred persons a gymnasium having a floor space of three thousand feet a physical and electrical laboratory a number of recitation rooms offices musicrooms etc The Ohio University is the oldest institution for higher education in the Northwest Territory having been chartered in 1804 The main building which is still in use was erected in 1817 Ohio has now four universities all of which have been provided by the Legislature with a per manent income COLBY University will begin at once the erec tion of a chemical laboratory to cost not less than 30000 THE Alumnae Association of Bryn Mawr Col lege has presented the College with 8000 for a scholarship as a memorial to the first Presi dent of the College the late Dr James E Rhodes DR CHARLES DE GARMO President of Swarth more College has been elected professor of the science and art of education at Cornell Univer sity At the same University Professor H W Hibberd of the University of Minnesota has been elected assistant professor of railway en gineering DR H EBERT of Kiel has been appointed professor of physics at Munich M JENVRESSE has been appointed professor of industrial and agricultual chemistry in Be sangon M Dubois associate professor of chem istry at Claremont and M Matignon lecturer in mineralogical chemistry at Lille filling temporarily the chair vacant by the death of M Joli AN anonymous donor has offered 10000 for the extension of the buildings of Aberdeen University on condition that the government grant 20000 for this purpose It is expected that the town will also assist DISCUSSION AND CORRESPONDENCE BREVITY IN CITATIONS To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE In one small mat ter at least the bibliographical reform which is making great strides has as yet failed to produce any improvement over past conditions And it is not in the spirit of criticism but in the hope that needed relief may be afforded that public attention is hereby called to this item All authors who devote that care to biblio graphical citations which is desirable give an exact statement of the volume pages plates etc for each paper or work to which reference is made and one might well wish that this were at times more general especially where an entire half day has been devoted to the search of a loosely quoted passage which hap pens to be essential to the point in mind No one would desire to limit or in any way dis courage this practice but there is one feature that seems to be a waste of space time and en ergynamely the endless repetition of the words volume number part and page or their equivalent in some other language Even in the usual abbreviated form in which such words ap pear they mean in the aggregate not a little space and time to both author and publisher I am aware that individuals have endeavored more or less consistently and sometimes suc cessfully to abandon them but despite this the words continue to be generally used Is this not largely because there has been no agreement as to the form a citation shall take and con sequently some uncertainty as to the interpre tation of the reference which causes the care ful student to hesitate in introducing a system that may trouble or mislead his readers Our botanical confreres adopted in 1895 at the Madison Botanical Congress a set of rules for citation which appear in every way admi rable They are clear concise and seemingly complete and the saving in their use is evident from the examples given I have no means of knowing how generally they have been adopted by botanists even in this country and it is of course questionable whether they would be in 317

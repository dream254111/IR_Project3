BRYAN M A CAMBRIDGE ENGLAND IT was only a week or two before reading Professor Liveings interesting communication in Science that I had made some calculations which led me to adopt the same theory which he has advocated The object of my inves tigations was in fact to show that we could not regard the atmospheres of the different members of the solar sys tem as isolated masses of gas from which molecules might fly off if their speeds were to become sufficiently great but that to account for the very existence of plane tary atmospheres at all it would be necessary to adopt the hypothesis of an atmosphere of excessive tenuity per vading both interplanetary and interstellar space It is unfortunate that Mr Howard did not apply the principle of conservation of energy to the arguments con tained in his letter in the issue of April 28 Had he done so he would have realized that the question as to whether a molecule will permanently leave the atmosphere of the Moon or a planet depends only on its speed irrespective of direction and does not in any way depend on whether the motion takes place in a vertical direction In fact if the kinetic energy of a molecule is greater than the work required to be done against the planets attraction in or der to remove the molecule to an infinite distance the molecule will describe a hyperbola and will fly off never to return again no matter what be its direction of motion provided that it does not come into collision with any other molecule or with the planet itself Again the speed required to leave the Earth is about five times as great as that required to leave the Moon but this is not because the earths attraction is five times as great as the Moons but because the Earths potential is about twentyfive times as great as the Moons conse quently in order to leave the Earth a particle would re quire to have twentyfive times the kinetic energy or five times the speed which it would require to leave the Moon According to the wellknown error law of distribu tion of speed among the molecules of a gas which forms the basis of calculations connected with the kinetic the ory there must always be some molecules moving with sufficiently great speeds to overcome the attraction of any body however powerful and some whose speed is too small to enable them to escape from the attraction of any body however feeb e On this assumption no planet can have an absolutely permanent atmosphere and no planet 3t or satellite which has ever had an atmoslhere could get rid of that atmosphere entirely If however the propor tion of molecules which escape is relatively exceedingly small any changes which occur in the nature of the at mosphere of the planet will take place so slowly that countless ages will have to elapse before they make them selves felt In order therefore to test the relative de gree of permanence of the atmospheres of different celes tial bodies I have calculated what proportion of the mole cules of oxygen and hydrogen at different temperatures have a sufficiently great speed to fly off from the surfaces of and never return to the Moon Mars and the Earth I have also given the corresponding results for the Sun not however at its surface but at the Earths distance from the Suns centre where the critical speed is of course square root of two times the speed of the Earths orbital motion The numbers which are given in Table 1 below repre sent in each case the average number of molecules among which there is one molecule whose speed exceeds the crit ical amount Thus for oxygen at temperature 0C rather over one molecule in every three billion is moving fast enough to fly off permanently from the Moon and only one in every 23x10329 is moving fast enough to es cape from the Earths atmosphere while the Suns attrac tion even at the distance of the Earth prevents more than one in every 2x10491 from escaping When we arrive at such vast numbers as this it might be reasonable to object that we have pushed the kinetic theory a great deal further than it will go The assump tions made in many proofs of the error law of distribu tion certainly preclude its application to high speeds that are so rarely attained Still there is no physical limit to the speed which any individual molecule might acquire in the course of colliding with other molecules As Professor Liveing has pointed out all that would be necessary would be a sufficiently long run of collisions in each of which the line of impact happened to be nearly perpen dicular to the direction in which the molecule in question was previously moving so that each impinging molecule should transfer the greater portion of its energy to that one Imolecule And theory points to the conclusion that whenever there is any law of permanent distribution of the mole cules of a gas that law must be the error law Hence the calculations may be reasonably expected to give a cor rect estimate of the proportion of molecules whose speed exceeds the critical speed provided that the mass of gas under consideration is so large that the total number of such molecules is great however small their relative pro portion may be Thus we are at least justified in regard ing the figures as affording indications of the relative permanency or otherwise of the gaseous envelopes sur rounding different bodies of the solar system One great difficulty presented by the theory is that oe taking account of the differences of temperature of the atmospheres of the different bodies There seems to be good reason for believing that the Moons temperaturf may fall below 200C in which case only one molecule in 7x105 will be able to escape And generally the larger members of the solar systenm are the hotter and this would cause them to part with their atlmospheres more readily in proportion than they would if all the bodies were at one common temperature If the absolute tem peratures of different bodies were proportional to their gravitation potentials the proportion of molecules pos sessing the speed requisite to carry them off would be the same for all This condition would require the Earths atmosphere to have an absolute temperature roughly twentyfive times as high as that of the Moons Even supposing this were the case it does not necessarily December 8 18931

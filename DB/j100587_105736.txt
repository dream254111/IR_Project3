OF THE LATE TRANSIT OF VENUS IN WHICH THIS SUBJECT IS TREATED OF MORE AT LENGTH AND THE QUANTITY OF THE PARALLAX MORE FULLY ASCERTAINED BY JAMES SHORT M A AND F R S I N THE LAST VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS OF THE ROYAL ACADEMY AT PARIS FOR THE YEAR 1761 THERE IS A MEMOIR BY M PINGRE WHO WENT TO THE ISLAND OF RODRIGUES AND OBSERVED THE TRANSIT OF VENUS THERE IN THIS MEMOIR M PINGRE ENDEAVOURS TO DETERMINE THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN BY THE OBSERVATION OF THE LATE TRANSIT OF VENUS TO BE  10 BOTH BY THE OBSERVED DURATIONS THE LEAST DIS TANCE OF THE CENTERS AND BY THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS AND SEEEMS TO THINK THAT THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE IN THE OBSERVATION OF MR MASON AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE PARTICULARLY WITH REGARD TO THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN MR MASONS OBSER VATORY AND PARIS BECAUSE BY COMPARING THE OBSER VATION OF MR MASON AT THE CAPE WITH THE EUROPEAN OBSERVATIONS HE FINDS THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN FROM THENCE RESULTING TO BE BETWEEN 8 AND 9 CONSE QUENTLY DIFFERING FROM THE DETERMINATION BY THE OB SERVATION AT RODRIGUES WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SAME PLACES I SHALL THEREFORE IN THIS PAPER ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE BEYOND ALL DOUBT BY A COMPARISON OF THE OBSERVATIONS READ

BETWEEN 8 AND 9 AND THAT THIS DETERMINATION IS THE SAME OR VERY NEARLY THE SAME AS WHEN THE OBSERVATION AT THE CAPE IS COMPARED WITH THE SAME PLACES I SHALL ALSO ENDEAVOUR TO PROVE THAT THERE IS A MISTAKE OF ONE MINUTE IN TIME IN WRIT ING DOWN THE TIME OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS AT RODRIGUES AND THAT THIS BEING CORRECTED THE RE SULTS OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY A COMPARISON OF THE OBSERVATION AT RODRIGUES WITH THE OBSERVATIONS AT THE SEVERAL PLACES ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE IS THE SAME WITH THAT WHICH RESULTS FROM ALL THE REST AND THIS AGREE MENT IS ALSO AN ARGUMENT THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SUCH A MISTAKE IN SETTING DOWN THE TIME OF THE INTER NAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS AT RODRIGUES I SHALL ALSO SHEW THAT THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN DETERMINED FROM THE OBSERVED DURATIONS AND FROM THE LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS IS VERY NEARLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH IS DETERMINED FROM THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS THOUGH THESE LAST DETERMINATIONS CANNOT BE SO MUCH DEPENDED ON BECAUSE OF THE MINUTE ELEMENTS FROM WHICH THEY ARE DRAWN I SHALL THEREFORE PROCEED TO COMPARE THE OBSERVATI ONS OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT MADE ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE ONLY AND FROM THENCE DETERMINE THE SUNS PAR ALLAX IN ORDER TO DO THIS IT IS NECESSARY THAT THE DIF FERENCES OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THE PLACES OF OBSERVA TION COMPARED TOGETHER BE WELL ASCERTAINED AND IN THE DOING OF THIS IN ALL PLACES WHERE THE INGRESS WAS OBSERVED I HAVE BEEN MUCH OBLIGED TO A VERY INGE NIOUS METHOD PROPOSED BY M PINGRE IN HIS AFORESAID MEMOIR TO WHICH I REFER AND FOR THE LONGITUDES OF OTHER PLACES I HAVE

CLEAR TO ME THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A MISTAKE IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE IN TERNAL CONTACT AT THE INGRESS AT STOKOLM OWING AS I MENTIONED IN MY FORMER PAPER TO THE SMALL ALTITUDE OF THE SUN AT THE TIME OF THE INGRESS FOR BY COM PARING THE TIMES OF INGRESS AND EGRESS OBSERVED AT STOKOLM AND UPSAL WE FIND THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THESE TWO PLACES IS 1 39 AND 1 59 AND AS WE ARE SURE THAT THE OBSERVATION AT THE EGRESS GIVES THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE THE MOST CER TAIN IN THIS CASE THEREFORE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ERROR WAS AT THE INGRESS AND IT IS EASY TO PROVE THAT THE ERROR IS IN THE OBSERVATION AT STOKOLM TO AVOID ALL UNCERTAINTY AND TO BE AS CLEAR AND DISTINCT AS POSSIBLE I SHALL SET DOWN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE THE OBSERVATION AT THE EGRESS AT EACH PLACE COM PARED THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN EACH PLACE COMPARED THE EFFECT OF THE PARALLAXES RESULTING FROM THE COMPARISON AND ALSO THE EFFECT OF THE PARALLAXES COMPUTED ON A SUPPOSITION THAT THE SUNS PARALLAX IS

GREATEST DIFFERENCE OF THE EFFECT OF THE PARALLAXES IN ANY OF THESE COMPARISONS DOES NOT EXCEED 3 31 CONSE QUENTLY THAT THIS IS TOO SMALL A BASE FROM WHICH WE CAN EXPECT ANY GREAT EXACTNESS IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BUT IF WE CONSIDER THE GREAT NUM BER OF COMPARISONS NO LESS THAN 116 THE CERTAINTY OF THE DIFFERENCES OF LONGITUDE OF MOST OF THE PLACES OF OBSERVATION AND THE SMALL DIFFERENCES IN THE RESULTS THEMSELVES I CANNOT HELP THINKING THAT THE FORCE OF THIS OBJECTION IS IN SOME MEASURE REMOVED AND THAT THIS DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY THE OB SERVATIONS AT PLACES ON THIS SIDE OF THE LINE ONLY MUST BE VERY NEAR THE TRUTH IN ORDER THEREFORE TO REMOVE THE FORCE OF THIS OBJECTION ENTIRELY LET US NEXT CONSIDER THE OBSERVATI ON AT THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE BY WHICH WE SHALL HAVE A BASE VERY NEAR THREE TIMES GREATER THAN THE FORMER AND ALSO THE OBSERVATION AT RODRIGUES BY WHICH THE BASE IS NEARLY DOUBLE OF THE FORMER BUT BEFORE I PROCEED I MUST TAKE NOTICE THAT IN THE ME MOIR BY M PINGRE BEFORE MENTIONED THE TIME OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS AT RODRIGUES IS SET DOWN AT OH 36 49 BUT IN THE SAME VOLUME THERE IS AN ACCOUNT OF M PINGRES OBSERVATION SENT TO

THAT M PINGRE BELIEVED THAT THE EXTERNAL CONTACT DID NOT HAPPEN BE FORE 0H 53 18 THIS BEING ALLOWED LET US COM PUTE THE DURATION OF THE EGRESS AT RODRIGUES WHICH WE SHALL FIND  17 55 IT FOLLOWS THEREFORE THAT THE INTERNAL CONTACT HAPPENED AT 0H 35 23 BUT THIS SUPPOSES THAT THE OBSERVER COULD SEE THE VERY LAST CONTACT OF VENUS WITH THE SUNS LIMB THE CONTRARY OF WHICH I HAVE SHEWN IN A FORMER PAPER ON THIS SUBJECT WE ARE THEREFORE CERTAIN THAT THE EXTERNAL CONTACT HAPPENED LATER THAN 0H 53 18 BY SEVERAL SECONDS CONSEQUENTLY THE INTERNAL CONTACT HAPPENED LATER THAN 0H 35 23 BY SEVERAL

IT SHOULD BE 0H 35 47 THIS SORT OF MISTAKE HAS HAPPENED SEVERAL TIMES IN THE OBSERVATIONS OF THIS TRANSIT BUT THEY ARE EASILY DISCO VERED I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO COMPARE THE OBSERVATION OF THE INTERNAL

THE OBSERVATION AT THE CAPE AND BOTH IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS THE ERROR PRODUCED IN THE PARALLAX BY THOSE 12 WILL AMOUNT ONLY TO 16 OF A SECOND EVEN THOUGH WE HAD ONLY THESE TWO OB SERVATIONS TO DETERMINE THE SUNS PARALLAX BUT SINCE WE HAVE A GREAT NUMBER OF VERY GOOD OBSERVATIONS MADE AT OTHER PLACES IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MEAN OF ALL THESE MUST GIVE THE SUNS PARALLAX TO A LESS ERROR THAN 16 OF A SECOND AND CONSEQUENTLY VERY NEAR THE TRUTH IN ALL PLACES WHERE THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS WAS OBSERVED AND WHERE THERE WERE MORE OBSERVERS THAN ONE WE FIND A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIME OF EACH OBSERVER THE OBSERVATION AT GREENWICH IS AN EXCEP TION TO THIS AS THE THREE OBSERVERS ALL AGREE TO THE SAME SECOND IN THE OBSERVATION OF THE CONTACT OF VENUS WITH THE SUNS LIMB WHICH IS THE MORE SUR PRIZING AS THEY USED TELESCOPES OF DIFFERENT CONSTRUC U U 2 TIONS328 TIONS AND OF DIFFERENT MAGNIFYING POWERS THIS CO INCIDENCE NOT ONLY SURPRIZED ME BUT ALSO THE REVE REND MR HORNSBY NOW SAVILIAN PROFESSOR OF ASTRONO MY AT OXFORD MR HORNSBY WENT TO GREENWICH IN THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR 1762 AND ON HIS RETURN TOLD ME THAT HIS SURPRIZE WAS AT AN END FOR HE HAD BEEN INFORMED AT GREENWICH THAT MR GREEN THE ASSISTANT OBSERVER THERE AS SOON AS HE JUDGED THAT THE INTERNAL CONTACT WAS FORMED CALLED OUT NOW THIS MUST CERTAINLY HAVE CAUSED SOME DISTURBANCE TO THE OTHER OBSERVERS AND MIGHT POSSIBLY INFLUENCE THEIR JUDGMENT AND THE FACT AS I AM INFORMED WAS THAT EACH OBSERVER HAD A SECOND WATCH IN HIS HAND AND THEY INSTANTLY STOPED THEIR WATCHES EACH HAVING HIS HAND AT HIS WATCH READY TO STOP THIS PROBLEM THEREFORE IS EASILY SOLVED AND THE SURPRIZE AT THE CO INCIDENCE ENTIRELY VANISHES SO THAT THIS OBSERVATION CAN BE LOOKED ON AS NO MORE THAN THE OBSERVATION OF ONE PERSON AND HE TOO NOT MUCH PRACTISED IN OB SERVING MOREOVER IT IS PROPER I SHOULD OBSERVE THAT ANOTHER PERSON WAS PRESENT AT THIS OBSERVATION WHO CONFIRMED THE ABOVE ACCOUNT THE VERY NEAR COINCIDENCE OF THE THREE OBSERVERS AT GREENWICH IN THE TIME OF THE EXTERNAL CONTACT RE MAINS NOW TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR MR GREEN DID NOT CALL OUT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE HE WAS FORBID BY DR BRADLEY WHO WAS PRESENT THOUGH NOT IN A CONDITION TO OBSERVE BECAUSE OF HIS BAD STATE OF HEALTH THIS PROBLEM THEREFORE MAY BE SOLVED IN THE FOLLOWING MANNER THE OBSERVATION OF THE EXTERNAL CONTACT WAS UNDOUBTEDLY MORE UNCERTAIN THAN THE FORMER AND YET WE FIND TWO OF THE OBSERVERS AGREEING TO THE SAME SECOND AND THE THIRD DIFFERING ONLY ONE SECOND FROM THEM IF WE ATTEND TO THE FOLLOWING CIRCUM 5 STANCES329 STANCES WE SHALL BE IMMEDIATELY SATISFIED BY THEM EACH OBSERVER HAD A SECONDWATCH IN HIS HAND THE THREE OBSERVERS WERE AT THE SAME WINDOW OF THE SAME ROOM ONE OF THEM ON THE LEADS IMMEDIATELY WITH OUT THE WINDOW AND THE OTHER TWO WITHIN THE WIN DOW THEREFORE EACH OBSERVER WAS WITHIN HEARING AND SEEING OF EACH OTHER CONSEQUENTLY THE INSTANT ONE OF THE OBSERVERS STOPPED HIS WATCH MAY IT NOT BE PRE SUMED THAT THE NOISE OF THE NICKING OF IT MIGHT BE HEARD BY THE REST ESPECIALLY AS THERE WAS A PROFOUND SILENCE DURING THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION I HAVE THOUGHT PROPER TO TAKE NOTICE OF THESE FACTS BECAUSE SEVERAL PERSONS BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD HAVE EXPRESSED THEIR SURPRIZE AT THIS COINCIDENCE AND THAT SUCH AN EXACTNESS MAY NOT BE ESTABLISHED AS A PRECE DENT IN THESE SORT OF OBSERVATIONS AND BECAUSE I THINK IT ESSENTIALLY NECESSARY IN ALL SORTS OF OBSERVATIONS ESPECIALLY IN ONE OF SO MUCH IMPORTANCE IN ASTRONOMY AS THIS THAT EVERY THE MINUTEST CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD BE PARTICULARLY RELATED WE ARE NOW TO FIND THE LIMITS OF THE ERROR ARISING FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN TOBOLSK AND THE CAPE I FIND THAT AN ERROR OF 110 IN TIME IN THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THESE TWO PLACES WILL CAUSE AN ERROR OF 1 IN THE SUNS PARALLAX BUT AS WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THIS ERROR IN LONGITUDE DOES NOT TAKE PLACE THEREFORE WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THE ERROR IN THE PARALLAX IS WITHIN ONE SECOND OF THE TRUTH THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE AND PARIS IS DETERMINED BOTH BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF M DE LA CAILLE AND MR MA SON THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN PARIS AND UPSAL IN SWEDEN IS SETTLED BY THE OBSERVATIONS OF JU PITERS330 PITERS FIRST SATELLITE AND THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN UPSAL AND TOBOLSK IS SETTLED BY THE OBSER VATIONS OF THE CONTACT AT THE INGRESS AT BOTH PLACES BY THE METHOD OF M PINGRE ABOVE MENTIONED THEREFORE THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THE CAPE AND TOBOLSK IS VERY EXACTLY SETTLED SO EXACTLY THAT I AM PERSWADED THAT THE ERROR DOES NOT AMOUNT TO 5 OR 6 SECONDS THEREFORE THE ERROR IN THE PARAL LAX ARISING FROM THE ERROR OF THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGI TUDE IS EXTREMELY SMALL SCARCELY AMOUNTING TO 112 PART OF A SECOND THEREFORE WE ARE CERTAIN THAT THE ERROR IN THE SUNS PARALLAX ARISING BOTH FROM THE ERROR OF OBSERVATION AND THE ERROR OF LONGITUDE DOES NOT EXCEED 14 OF A SECOND IN THE COMPARISON OF THE OB SERVATIONS OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT TOBOLSK AND AT THE CAPE EVEN THOUGH WE HAD NO MORE OBSERVATIONS TO DETERMINE THE SUNS PARALLAX BUT THE MEAN OF A GREAT MANY MORE MUST BRING IT VERY NEAR THE TRUTH I NOW PROCEED TO DETERMINE THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN FROM THE TOTAL DURATIONS OBSERVED AT DIFFERENT PLACES IF THEREFORE WE COMPARE THE DURATIONS OB SERVED AT TOBOLSK CAJANEBURG ABO AND TORNEA WITH THE DURATIONS OBSERVED AT MADRASS GRAND MOUNT AND TRANQUEBAR WHICH GIVE THE GREATEST DIFFERENCES THE RESULTS OF THE SUNS PARALLAX WILL BE AS FOLLOW TOBOLSK331 SUNS PAR DIFFERENCE OF DURATION    TOBOLSK AND MADRASS    9 61 2 50 G MOUNT  8 33 2 27 TRANQUEBAR  8

REST THE MEAN OF THE REMAINING 8 GIVES THE SUNS PARALLAX  8 61 THIS DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX CANNOT BE DEPENDED ON TO ANY GREAT PRECISION BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE DURATIONS COMPARED THE GREATEST OF WHICH AMOUNTS ONLY TO 250 AND ALSO BECAUSE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF COMPARISONS IT SERVES ONLY TO SHEW NEARLY WHAT IS THE QUANTITY OF THE SUNS PARALLAX WE ARE NOW TO DETERMINE THE LIMITS OF THE ERROR IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY THE DU RATIONS OBSERVED AT TWO DIFFERENT PLACES THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE OF DURATION IS BETWEEN TOBOLSK AND MA DRASS WHICH AMOUNTS ONLY TO 2 50 IF THEREFORE  AN332 AN ERROR OF 20 IN TIME IS COMMITTED IN THE OBSER VATIONS OF THE INGRESS AND EGRESS AT BOTH THE PLACES COMPARED THIS ERROR OF 20 IN TIME WILL CAUSE AN ERROR OF 1 IN THE RESULT OF THE SUNS PARALLAX AND IN THE COMPARISONS OF THOSE PLACES WHERE THE DIFFER ENCE OF DURATION IS LESS WILL OCCASION A GREATER ERROR AND THEREFORE THE DETERMINATION OF THE PARALLAX BY THIS METHOD CANNOT BE DEPENDED ON TO ANY GREAT EX ACTNESS BECAUSE OF THE SMALL DIFFERENCES OF THE DURA TIONS COMPARED IN THIS METHOD HOWEVER WE ARE FREE FROM THE UNCERTAINTY ARISING FROM THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE NOT BEING EXACTLY KNOWN I NOW PROCEED TO THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY THE LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS THERE ARE COME TO MY HANDS ONLY TWO MEASUREMENTS OF THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS OF THE SUN AND VENUS ONE AT TOBOLSK AND THE OTHER AT RODRIGUES I SHALL ONLY CONSIDER THE MEASUREMENT AT RODRIGUES BECAUSE THERE SEEMS TO ME TO BE SOME MISTAKE IN THE MEASURE MENT AT TOBOLSK IF WE SUPPOSE THE SUNS PARALLAX  8 5 THEN THE APPARENT MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT HAP PENED AT RODRIGUES AT 9H 37 30 THERE IS A MEA SUREMENT BY M PINGRE OF THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS AT 9H 38 13 WHICH IS SO NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT THAT WE MAY SAFELY TAKE THIS QUANTITY VIZ 5 54 6  FOR THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS OF THE SUN AND VENUS AND ESPECIALLY AS IT IS MARKED AN EXACT OBSERVATION THIS MEASUREMENT THEREFORE GIVES THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS OF THE  I ALL ALONG CONSIDER THE OBSERVATION OF M PINGRE AT ROD RIGUES AS IT IS PRINTED FROM HIS OWN LETTER IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS SUN333 SUN AND VENUS AT RODRIGUES  9 21 4 SUPPO SING THEN THIS MEASUREMENT TO BE EXACT HERE FOLLOWS AN IRREFRAGABLE ARGUMENT INDEPENDENT OF ALL OTHER METHODS TO PROVE THAT THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN IS VERY NEARLY  8 5 LET US SUPPOSE THE SUNS PA RALLAX  10 AND LET US COMPUTE BY THE FOLLOWING METHOD THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS AT TOBOLSK FROM THENCE WE SHALL FIND THAT THE GEO CENTRIC LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS AT TOBOLSK IS 567 416 AND BY THE OBSERVATION AT RODRIGUES THE GEOCENTRIC LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS IS  572 612 SO THAT ON THIS SUPPOSITION WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT GEOCENTRIC LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS WHICH BE ING ABSURD IT FOLLOWS THAT THE SUNS PARALLAX IS NOT 10 AGAIN LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE SUNS PARALLAX IS  7 WE SHALL FIND THAT THE GEOCENTRIC LEAST DIS TANCE OF THE CENTERS BY THE OBSERVATION AT TOBOLSK IS  575 356 AND BY THE OBSERVATION AT ROD RIGUES IT IS  569 248 THUS THEN AGAIN WE HAVE TWO DIFFERENT GEOCENTRIC LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS WHICH BEING ABSURD IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PA RALLAX OF THE SUN IS NOT 7 AGAIN IF WE SUPPOSE THE SUNS PARALLAX  8 OR 9 WE SHALL FIND THAT THE SAME ABSURDITY WILL FOLLOW BUT IN THESE TWO LAST SUPPOSITIONS WE SHALL FIND THAT THE DIFFERENCES OF THE GEOCENTRIC LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS ARE NOT SO GREAT AS ON THE SUPPOSITIONS OF 10 AND 7 IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN IS LESS THAN 9 AND MORE THAN 8 AND IF WE CONTINUE TO REASON IN THE SAME MANNER WE SHALL FIND THAT ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT THE SUNS PARALLAX IS  8 5 THE GEOCENTRIC LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS SEVERALLY FOUND BY THE OBSER V O L LIII X X VATION334 VATION AT TOBOLSK AND AT RODRIGUES IS VERY NEARLY THE SAME CONSEQUENTLY THAT THE SUNS PARALLAX IS VERY NEARLY  8 5 IF WE PURSUE THIS SUBJECT TO A GREATER PRECI SION AND SUPPOSE THAT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS OF THE SUN AND VENUS TAKEN BY M PINGRE TO BE PERFECTLY EXACT AND COMPUTE ON TRUE  PRINCIPLES THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS FROM THE DURATIONS OBSERVED AT THE DIFFER ENT PLACES IN THE NORTH THE METHOD OF WHICH I SHALL AFTERWARDS GIVE THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN WILL COME

RESULTS OF THE PA RALLAX ARISING FROM THE COMPARISONS OF THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS AGREEING WITH THE FOR MER DETERMINATIONS OF THE PARALLAX BY THE INTERNAL CONTACTS ARE A PROOF OF THE ACCURACY OF THIS MEA SUREMENT OF THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS MADE BY M PINGRE AT RODRIGUES X X 2 THERE336 THERE ARE 12 PLACES AT WHICH THE TOTAL DURATION WAS OBSERVED THREE OF THESE HAD A NORTHERN PARALLAX OF LATI TUDE AT THE MIDDLE OF THE TRANSIT THE OTHER NINE HAD A SOUTHERN PARALLAX OF LATITUDE LET THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS AT EACH PLACE OF OBSERVATION BE SOUND BY THE FOLLOWING METHOD LET THESE BE COM PARED TOGETHER AND WE SHALL HAVE THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN RESULTING FROM THEM FOR THIS PURPOSE I HAVE COMPUTED THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS AT THE 8 FOLLOWING PLACES AND HAVE COMPARED THEM WITH THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS AT THE FOUR FOLLOWING PLACES AND FROM EACH COMPARISON I HAVE COMPUTED THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN AND THEY ARE AS IN

THE SUNS PARALLAX  8 53 THIS VERY NEAR AGREEMENT WITH THE FORMER DETERMINATIONS IS SOMEWHAT SURPRIZING WHEN WE CONSIDER THE SMALLNESS OF THE BASE FROM WHICH THEY ARE COMPUTED THE GREATEST SCARCELY EX CEEDING 20 OF AN ANGLE BUT WE ARE ALSO TO CONSI DER THAT THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS MAY BE FOUND FROM THE DURATION OBSERVED TO A VERY GREAT EXACTNESS AND NOTHING AFFECTS THE ACCURACY OF IT BUT THE ERRORS IN THE OBSERVATION LET US SUPPOSE THEN THAT AN ERROR OF 6 IN TIME HAPPENED IN EACH OF337 OF THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE INGRESS AND EGRESS BOTH IN CONTRARY DIRECTIONS THE SUM OF THE ERRORS THEREFORE IN EACH COMPARISON WILL AMOUNT TO 24 OF TIME THIS WILL PRODUCE AN ERROR OF 1 OF SPACE IN THE AP PARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS BY COMPUTATION BUT THIS ERROR OF 1 CANNOT PRODUCE AN ERROR OF SO MUCH AS HALF A SECOND IN THE DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS ON THE ABOVE SUPPOSITION OF AN ERROR OF 24 OF TIME IN THE OBSER VATION THAT THOUGH WE HAD NO OTHER OBSERVATIONS OF THE TRANSIT OF VENUS THAN TWO OF THE ABOVE TOTAL DU RATIONS SUPPOSE THAT OF CAJANEBURG AND MADRASS YET WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN OF THE PA RALLAX OF THE SUN WITHIN LESS THAN AN ERROR OF HALF A SECOND AND THEREFORE OF COURSE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE MEAN OF SO GREAT A NUMBER OF RESULTS MUST BE VERY NEAR THE TRUTH THIS DETERMINATION OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY THE LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS IS ALSO A CONVINCING PROOF THAT THERE IS NO MISTAKE IN THE OBSERVATION OF MR MA SON AT THE CAPE AS ALLEDGED BY M PINGRE AND THAT THERE MUST BE A MISTAKE OF 1IN SETTING DOWN THE TIME OF THE INTERNAL CONTACT AT THE EGRESS AT RODRIGUES NOTWITHSTANDING M PINGRE IN THE AFORESAID MEMOIR PREFERS HIS OBSERVATION TO THAT OF MR MASON BE CAUSE AS HE SAYS THAT AFTER A STRICT EXAMINATION OF ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS OBSERVATION HE COULD NOT FIND ANY MISTAKE IN IT BUT ALSO BECAUSE HE HAS PROVED THAT NO MISTAKE COULD POSSIBLY BE COMMITTED IN THIS DETERMINATION OF THE PARALLAX BY THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS WE ARE NOT EMBARRASSED WITH AN EXACT KNOWLEDGE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGI TUDE BETWEEN THE PLACES COMPARED WHICH THEREFORE IN338 IN SOME MEASURE COMPENSATES FOR THE SMALNESS OF THE BASE THE SAME IRREFRAGABLE ARGUMENT MADE USE OF IN THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS MEASURED AT RODRIGUES TO PROVE THAT THE PARALLAX OF THE SUN IS VERY NEARLY  8 5MAY LIKEWISE BE DEDUCED FROM THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CENTERS COMPUTED FROM THE TOTAL DURATIONS OBSERVED AT THESE 12 PLACES BUT WITH MORE CERTAINTY BECAUSE THE DETERMINATION OF THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCES OF THE CENTERS FROM THE OBSERVED TOTAL DURATIONS MAY BE DEPENDED ON TO A VERY GREAT PRECISION BUT THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID WITH REGARD TO THE APPARENT LEAST DISTANCE OF THE CEN TERS MEASURED AT RODRIGUES FOR M PINGRE TELLS US THAT HE USED A VERY GOOD MICROMETER FITTED TO A RE FRACTING TELESCOPE OF NINE FEET FOCUS THE OBJECTGLASS OF WHICH WAS BUT AN INDIFFERENT ONE AND WE ARE VERY CERTAIN THAT IN MEASURING WITH A MICROMETER OF THIS SORT DARK OBJECTS ON A WHITE FIELD OR GROUND IF THE IMAGE IS ANY WAY INDISTINCT THE ANGLE MEASUR ED WILL BE LESS THAN THE TRUE ANGLE AND VICE VERSA WHEN A BRIGHT OBJECT IS MEASURED ON A DARK GROUND AS A PROOF OF THIS REMARK WE FIND THAT M PINGRE MEASURED AND FOUND THE DIAMETER OF VENUS WHEN ON THE SUN  54 7 WHEREAS WE ARE CERTAIN THAT IT WAS ABOVE 58 AND THEREFORE WE MAY PRESUME THAT THE MEASUREMENTS OF THE GREATEST DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS MIGHT BE GREATER THAN THE TRUE DISTANCE AND AS A FURTHER PROOF OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE MEASURE MENTS MADE WITH THIS INSTRUMENT WE FIND THAT M PINGRE MAKES THE DISTANCE OF THE LIMBS GREATEST SE VERAL MINUTES AFTER IT WAS PAST THE GREATEST I SHALL339 I SHALL NOW PRODUCE AT ONE VIEW THE MEANS OF THE SEVERAL DETERMINATIONS OF THE SUNS PARALLAX BY THE BEFOREMENTIONED THREE SEVERAL METHODS WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS WHOLE PAPER 1MO THE MEAN OF 116 COMPARISONS OF THE

8 56 AND THAT FROM THREE DIFFERENT MODES OF COMPARING TOGETHER A GREAT NUM BER OF OBSERVATIONS VARIOUSLY COMBINED THE SEVERAL RESULTS SO NEARLY COINCIDING THAT TO ME IT SEEMS IM POSSIBLE THAT THE MEAN OF THEM ALL CAN ERR 110 OF A SECOND AND THAT PROBABLY THE ERROR DOES NOT EXCEED 1500 PART OF THE WHOLE QUANTITY AS THE GREAT DR HALLEY HAD MANY YEARS SINCE CONFIDENTLY PRESAGED  AND THEREUPON I CANNOT BUT CONGRATULATE OUR AGE AND NATION PARTICULARLY THIS SOCIETY ON BEING ENABLED THROUGH THE ROYAL MUNIFICENCE TO SEND FIT OBSERVERS TO THE CAPE OF GOOD HOPE WHOSE POSITION AFFORDS THE LARGEST BASE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE SAFEST FOUNDA TION FOR THE TRUTH P S M PINGRE IN HIS AFORESAID MEMOIR SEEMS TO THINK THAT THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE IN MR MA SONS OBSERVATION AT THE CAPE BECAUSE BY COMPARING THE OBSERVATIONS OF JUPITERS SATELLITES MADE BY MR MASON AT THE CAPE WITH THOSE MADE BY M MESSIER AT PARIS HE FINDS THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THESE TWO PLACES LESS BY 1 OF TIME THAN BETWEEN PARIS AND THE OBSERVATORY OF M DE LA CAILLE AT THE CAPE AND THEREFORE IMAGINES THAT MR MASONS OB SERVATORY WAS TO THE WEST OF M DE LA CAILLES IF M PINGRE HAD LOOKED INTO THE MAP OF THE CAPE BY M DE LA

SURPRIZED TO SEE A DIFFERENCE OR ERROR OF 1 OF TIME IN DEDUCING THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN PARIS AND THE CAPE BY COMPARING MR MA SONS OBSERVATIONS WITH THOSE OF M MESSIER FOR I FIND IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THE MEMOIRS FOR 1761 A DIFFERENCE OF 1 5 BETWEEN M DE LA LANDE AND M MESSIER IN AN IMMERSION OF THE FIRST SATELLITE OF JU PITER BOTH OF THESE GENTLEMEN OBSERVING AT PARIS OWING I SUPPOSE TO THE DIFFERENT GOODNESS OF THE TELE SCOPES USED ON THIS OCCASION FOR M DE LA LANDE SAYS THAT HE USED AN 18 FOOT REFRACTER THE OBJECTGLASS OF WHICH WAS TOLERABLY GOOD AND THAT M MESSIER MADE USE OF A VERY GOOD REFLECTER OF 30 INCHES IF M PINGRE WILL TAKE THE TROUBLE OF LOOKING INTO THE PHI LOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL LII PART I HE WILL THERE FIND OBSERVATIONS MADE AT THE CAPE AND IN SUR REYSTREET LONDON OF THE IMMERSIONS OF THE FIRST AND SECOND SATELLITES OF JUPITER WITH REFLECTING TELESCOPES OF EQUAL GOODNESS OF TWO FEET FOCAL LENGTH WHERE THE DIFFERENCE OF DETERMINATION OF THE LONGITUDE OF THESE TWO PLACES DOES NOT EXCEED ONE SECOND IN THOSE OF THE FIRST SATELLITE AND NOT ABOVE 16 IN THOSE OF THE SECOND SATELLITE MR MASONS OBSERVATORY AT THE CAPE WAS ABOUT HALF A MILE TO THE SOUTH OF M DE LA CAILLES AND ABOUT 10 OR 12 YARDS TO THE WEST OF THE MERIDIAN OF THE SAME M PINGRE ALSO SEEMS TO THINK THAT THE TIME SHEWN BY MR MASONS CLOCK WAS TAKEN FROM A FALSE MERIDI AN WHEN M PINGRE SHALL READ THE ACCOUNT GIVEN BY MR MASON OF HIS OBSERVATIONS AT THE CAPE WHICH HE SAYS IN HIS MEMOIR HE HAS NOT SEEN I AM PER SWADED HE WILL BE FULLY FATISFIED FROM THE MANY E V O L LIII Y Y QUAL342 QUALALTITUDES TAKEN BY MR MASON THAT THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT OF THE TIMES OF HIS OBSERVATIONS BEING FOUND FROM A TRUE MERIDIAN I CANNOT LEAVE THIS SUBJECT WITHOUT TAKING NOTICE OF A REMARKABLE EXPRESSION IN THE HISTORY OF THE ME MOIRS OF THE R ACADEMY AT PARIS PAGE 96 FOR THE YEAR 1757 IT IS THERE SAID THAT THE ENGLISH INTEND ED TO SEND AN ASTRONOMER TO NORTH AMERICA TO OB SERVE THE TRANSIT OF VENUS ACCORDING TO THE PLAN LAID DOWN BY DR HALLEY BEFORE THEY SAW THE MAP OF THE TRANSIT BY M DE LISLE AND THE AUTHORITY PRODUCED FOR THIS ASSERTION ARE THE ENGLISH NEWS PAPERS WHICH IF THEY HAD UNDERSTOOD THE NATURE OF THESE PAPERS CAN BE NO AUTHORITY AT ALL I MUST THEREFORE ON THE BEST AUTHORITY INFORM THE GENTLEMEN WHO ARE THE COMPILERS OF THE HISTORY OF THESE MEMOIRS THAT THE R SOCIETY NEVER ONCE THOUGHT OF SENDING AN OBSER VER TO NORTH AMERICA EVEN BEFORE THEY SAW THE MAP OF THE TRANSIT BY M DE LISLE N B IN THIS PAPER I HAVE EMPLOYED THE SAME ELE MENTS AS IN MY FORMER PAPER ON THIS

WHICH ARE ADDED PROOFS OF THIS A4PPEARANCE BEING EXTENDED TO THE EYES OF OTHER ANIMTLS BY EVERARD HOME ESQ F R S READ APRIL 19 179 8 HAVING HAD THE HONOIBR OF LAYING BEFORE THIS LEARNED SOCIETV AT DIFFERENT TIMES OBSERVATIOJIS ONL THE STRUCTURE OF THE EYE BOTH IN MAN AND IN OTHER ANIMALS IL HAVE BEEN NATURALLY LED TO AVAIL MYSELF OF EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO INVESTIGATE THIS SUBJECT MY ATTENTION HAS BEEN RECENTLY DIRECTED TO THE PROSECUTION OF THIS INQUIRY BY A VERY CURIOUS DISCOVERY OF AN APERTURE IL THE RETINA OF THE HUMAN EYE WHICH WE OWE TO MR SOEN MERING AN ANATOMIST OF CONSIDERABLE REPUTATION RESIDENT AT MENTZ HIS ACCOUNT OF THIS DISCOVERY HAS BEEN PUBLISHED ON THE CONTINENT BUT I DO NOT KNOW THAT ANY COPY OF THE MEMOI HAS BEEN BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY IT WVAS BELIEVED BY MR SOEMMERING ARND ALSO BY THE FRENCH ANATOMISTS THAT THIS APPEARANCE IS ONLY TO BE MET WITH IN THE HUMAN EYE I HAVE HOWEVER BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO DISCOVER IT IN THE EYES OF OTHER ANIMALS AWID THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT PAPER IS TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY THE OBSERVATIONS I HAVE MADE UPON THIS SUBJECT I AM INDEBTED TO MY FRIEND SIR CHARPLYF BLAGDENT FOR THE FIRST INTELLIGENCE OF MR SOEMMERINGS DISCOVERY I AFTERWARDS RECEIVED AN MORE PCARTICULAR ACCOUNTS IN A VERY OBLIGING LETTERMR HOMES ACCOZUNT OF AN O4FICE C 335 FROM MR MAUNOIR AN EMINENT SURGEON AT GENEVA WHICH CONTAINS I BELIEVE THE MATERIAL INFORMATION PUBLISHED BY MR SOEMMERING I SHALL THEREFORE TRANSCRIBE THAT PART OF THE LETTER WHICH IS AS FOLLOWS THE WAR BEING ARN OBSTACLE TO A FREE COMMUNICATION BE TWVEEN ENGLAND AND THE CONTINENT YOU ARE NOT PERHAPS AC QUAINTED WITH A NEW DISCOVERY IN THE ANATOMY OF THE HUMAN EYE MADE BY A PROFESSOR OF MENTZ MR SOEMMERING PERMIT ME THEREFORE TO SAY SOMETHING ON THE SUBJECT HE WAS DIS SECTING IN THE BOTTOM OF A VESSEL FILLED WITH A TRANSPARENT LIQUID THE EYES OF A YOUNG MAN WHO HAD BEEN DROWNED AND WAS STRUCK ON SEEING NEAR THE INSERTION OF THE OPTIC NERVE ON THE RETINA A YELLOW ROUND SPOT AND A SMALL HOLE IN THE MID DLE THROUGH WHLICH HE COULD SEE THE DARK CHOROIDES LOOKING AT THE SURFACE OF THE RETINA WHICH COVERS THE VITREOUS HU MOUR IHE DISSECTED OTHER HUMAN EYES AND CONSTANTLY HLEN THE DISSECTION WA C ATEFUILY MADE FOUND THE HOLE OF THE RETINA SEEMNIGLY AT THE DOSTERIOR END OF THE VISUAL RA  IDIS RNEARLY TWNO LINES ON THE TEMPORAL SIDE OF THE OPTIC NERVE ANID

OWING TO A GREATER POWQR834 MR HOMES ACCOUNT OF AN ORIFLCE OF AUGMENTING OR DIMINISHING THE PUPIL THAN IN MEN IF MESSRS MARIOTTE AND LE CAT SHOULD COME TO LIFE AGAIN O THEY WOULD FIND IN THAT HOLE THE EXPLANATION OF THE PHAENO   MENON OF THE TWO CARDS ONE DISAPPEARING AT A CERTAIN DIS 6 TANCE FROM ONE EYE C WHICH MAY BE EXPLAINED BY SAYING 1 THAT WHERE THE OPTIC NERVE ENTERS THE BALL THERE IS NO CHO ROID AND SO NO VISION C I DISSECTED SOME HUMAN EYES A SHORT TIME AFTER I HAD READ THE DISCOVERY AND FOUND THE SPOT THE RUGA CONCEALING IT AND THE YELLOW ZONE THE BEST WAY I THINK TO SEE THEM IS TO TAKE OFF THE HALF POSTERIOR PART OF THE SCLEROTICA THEN THE CORRE SPONDENT PART OF THE CHOROID BOTH MUST BE CUT ROUND THE INSERTION OF THE OPTIC NERVE THE RETINA IS TO REMAIN BARE AND UNTOUCHED SUSTAINING ALONE THE VITREOUS HUMOUR THEN YOU  MAY SEE THE ROUND SPOT WHICH REACHES THE OPTIC NERVE AND A FOLD OF THE RETINA MARKING A DIAMETER OF THE SPOT THEN IF YOU PRESS THE BALL A LITTLE WITH YOUR FINGER SO AS TO PUSH THE VITREOUS HUMOUR RATHER NEAR THE BOTTOM OF THE EYE THE RUGA IS UNFOLDED AND YOU WILL SEE THE HOLE PERFECTLY ROUND OF 4 OF A LINE IN DIAMETER AND ITS EDGES VERY THIN ALL THIS CAN BE SEEN ON THE INSIDE OF THE EYE BUT NOT SO S PERFECTLY AND IN THAT EAW YOU MUST MAKE YOUR OBSERVA 1 TIONS IN WATER MANY MONTHS ELAPSED AFTER THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTERS BEFORE I COULD PROCURE AN EYE IN A PROPER STATE FOR OBSERVING THIS APER TURE IN THE RETINA BUT IN THE COURSE OF LAST MONTH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES OFFERED AND I SAW THE APPEARANCE DESCRIBED BY MR MAUNOIR VERY DISTINCTLY THE MODE I ADOPTED FOR EXAMINING THE RETINA WAS THAT OF REMOVING THE TRANSPARENT CORNEA THEN TAKING AWAY THE IRISIN THE RETINA OF THE EYE 335 AND WOUNDING THE CAPSULE OF THE CRYSTALLINE LENS SO AS TO DISENGAGE THE LENS WITHOUT REMOVING THAT PART OF THE CAPSULE WHICH ADHERES TO THE VITREOUS HUMOUR BY WHICH MEANS THE RETINA REMAINED UNDISTURBED AND COULD BE ACCURATELY EXAMINED WHEN A STRONG LIGHT WAS THROWN INTO THE EYE THE APERTURE IN THE RETINA SURROUNDED BY A ZONE WITH A RA DIATED APPEARANCE WAS DISTINCTLY SEEN ON THE TEMPORAL SIDE OF THE INSERTION OF THE OPTIC NERVE AND ABOUT 6 OF AN INCH DISTANT FROM IT APPARENTLY A LITTLE BELOW THE POSTERIOR END OF THE VISUAL RADIUS THE APERTURE ITSELF IN THIS VIEW WAS VERY SMALL AFTER HAVING VIEWED IT IN TWO DIFFERENT EYES I TOOK AN OPPORTUNITY OF SHOWING IT TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS AND SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN WHO BOTH SAW IT WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF DISTINCTNESS AT FIRST I BELIEVED IT NECESSARY TO HAVE A VERY FRESH EYE FOR DEMONSTRATING THIS APERTURE BUT I HAVE SINCE FOUND THAT IT IS MORE READILY SEEN IN AN EYE TWO DAYS AFTER DEATH THE ZONE WHICH IS THE MOST CONSPICUOUS PART BEING OF A LIGHTER COLOUR THE FIRST DAY THAN IT IS UPON THE SECOND I HAVE ALSO SUCCEEDED IN PRESERVING THE POSTERIOR PART OF THE EYE IN SPIRITS WITHOUT DESTROYING THE APPEARANCE OF THIS APER TURE THIS PREPARATION I AM UNWILLING TO BRING TO A PUBLIC MEETING OF THE SOCIETY SINCE IT MAY BE LIABLE TO BE INJURED BY BEING MUCH SHAKEN BUT I HOPE MY HAVING SHOWN IT TO SIR JOSEPH BANKS AND SIR CHARLES BLAGDEN WILL BE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE BOTH TO THE SOCIETY AND OTHERS THAT SUCH A PREPA RATION CAN BE MDCIDE I AM INDUCED TO MAKE THIS REMARK BY RECOLLECTING THAT A CELEBRATED ANATOMRIST OF EDINBURGHII DENIED IN HIS LAST PUBLI CATION TLAT THE ANTERIOR LAMINA OF THE CORNEA CCA BE SEPARATED FROM THEB QTHC17RSJ AS A CONTINUATION OF THE TENDONS OF THE FOURMR HOMES ACCOUNT OF AN ORIFSCE STRAIGHT MUSCLES OF THE EYE FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN BECAUSE HE COULD NOT SUCCEEDIN THE DEMONSTRATI6N OF IT THE FAILURE PROBABLY ARISING FROM THE EYE NOT BEING SUFFICIENTLY FRESH TO ADMIT OF SUCH A SEPARATION HAD IT BEEN MENTIONED IN MY FORMER PAPER THAT THE PREPARATION FROM WHICH THE ENGRAVING WAS MADE HAD BEEN SHOWN T6 THIS LEARNED SOCIETY OR TO ANY MEMBERS OF IT MY ASSERTION WOULD PROBABLY HAVE HAD MORE WEIGHT IN SEPARATING THE VITREOUS HUMOUR FROM THE RETINA I FOUND A GREATER ADHESION AT THIS PARTICULAR PART AND WVHEN THE VITREOUS HUMOUR WAS REMOVED THE RETINA WAS PULLED FORWARD FORMING A SMALL FOLD IN THE CENTRE OF WHICLHI WAS THIS APERTURE THIS DOUBLING WAS SOMETIMES PRODUCED BY ENDEAVOURING TO CUT THROUGH THE VITREOUS HUMOUR TO DISENGAGE THE CRYSTALLINE AND ITS CAPSULE I HAVE BEEN THE MORE PARTICULAR IN DESCRIBING THE APPEARANCE OF THIS APERTURE IN THE RETINA OF THE HUMAN EYE THAT WHILE I ANNOUNCE THIS CURIOUS DISCOVERY OF MR SOEMMERING TO THIS LEARNED SOCIETY I MAY GIVE THE MOST COMPLETE CONFIRMATION OF IT TO HAVE THIS IN MY POWER AFFORDS ME A PARTICULAR PLEASURE A IT GIVES ME AN OPPORTUNITY OF DOING JUSTICE TO THE MERIT OF A FOCIFN ANATOMIST WHO DESERVES SO HIGHLY OF OUR ART AND WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED TO HIS COTEMPORARIES THAT THOSE WHO LABOUR PATIENTLY AND FOLLOW THEIR PURSUITS WITH ARDOUR MAY STILL HOPE TO MAKE DISCOVERIES IN THE ANATOMY EVEMNOFTHOSE PARTS OF THE BODY WHICH ARE CONSIDERED AS THE BEST UNDERSTOOD SINCE THE HUMAN EYE

OTHER ANATOMISTS FROM BEING DISAPPOINTED IN NOT FINDING IT WHICH MAY READILY HAPPEN IF THE SEARCH BE NOT MADE WITH CONSIDERABLE ATTENTION IN THE SHEEP THERE IS NO APPEARANCE OF A ZONE SURROUNDING THE TUBE THESE FACTS ALTHOUGH FEW IN NUMBER ARE SUFFICIENT TO PROVE THAT THIS ORIFICE IS NOT PECULIAR TO THE RETINA OF THE HUMAN EYE AND THAT ITS SITUATION IN MAN AND IN THE MONKEY IS THE SAME IN THEM IT IS PLACED AT SOME DISTANCE FROM THE OPTIC NERVE BUT IN SOME OTHER ANIMALS ITS SITUATION IS CLOSE TO THAT NERVE AND IT PUTS ON THE APPEARANCE OF A TUBE INSTEAD OF AN ORIFICE THERE IS ONE CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH IS CURIOUS AND WHICH IT WILL REQUIRE FURTHER INFORMATION UPON THIS SUBJECT TO EXPLAIN THE YELLOW ZONE FOUND IN THE HUMAN EYE AND THATOF THE MON KEY IS NOT MET WITH IN ANY OTHER ANIMAL WHICH I HAVE EXA MINED HWSTING STATED THE FACTS AND ALSO THE OPINIONS OF OTHER ANAL TOINISTS THAT HAVE COME TO MY KNOWLEDGE AS WELL AS MY OWN OBSERVATIONS UPON THIS ORIFICE IN THE RETINA OF THE HUMAN EYE DISCOVERED BY MR SOEMMERING AND HAVING ADDED TO THESE SEVERAL NEW FACTS RESPECTING IT IN OTHER ANIMALS I SHALL DRAW SOMNE GENERAL CONCLUSIONS FROMN THE WHOLE WITH A VIEW TO SHOW THAT THE CONJECTURES WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE RESPECTING ITS USE ARE PROBABLY ERRONEOUS I SHALL AFTERWARDS POINT OUTSEVERALMR HOMES ACCOUNT OF AN ORIFLCE REASONS FOR CONSIDERING IT AS THE ORIFICE OF A LYMPHATIC VESSEL INTENDED TO CARRY OFF THE VITIATED PARTS OF THE VITREOUS HUMOUR AND CRYSTALLINE LENS IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT AS NO EXAMINATION CAN BE MADE FOR SOME CONSIDERABLE TIME AFTER DEATH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IS THE REAL STATE OF THIS ORIFICE IN THE LIVING EYE AND WHAT CHANGES TAKE PLACE IN IT AFTER DEATH WE ONLY LEARN THAT THE TINGE OF YELLOW SURROUNDING THE ORIFICE IS VERY SLIGHT WHEN THE EYE IS EXAMINED RECENTLY AND THAT THE NIEXT DAY IT BECOMES MUCH SDEEPER THESE POINTS APPEAR TO BE SATISFACTORILY CLEARED UP BY THE EXA MINATION THAT WAS MADE OF THE MONKEYS EYE AS IT WAS BEGUN BE FORE THE PARTS HAD LOST THE APPEARANCE BELONGING TO THEM AS LIVING PARTS IN THAT STATE THE RETINA WAS TRANSPARENT AND NO ORIFICE COULD BE SEEN SO THAT THE ORIFICE IS RENDERED VISIBLE BY REMAIN ING TRANSPARENT WHILE THE SURROUNDING RETINABECOMESIOPAQUE THIS APPEARS TO DECADE THE DISPUTE BETWEEN MESSRS SOEMMERING AND BUZZI FOR IF THIS PART DOES NOT UNDERGO THE CHANGE PE CULIAR TO THE RETINA WE MUST CONSIDER THE RETINA AS WANTING THERE AFTER THE ORIFICEIS THUS RENDERED VISIBLETHE YELLOW TINGE IS WANTING AND DOES NOT TAKE PLACE FOR SEVERAL HOURS AND EVEN THEN IS FAINTER THAN IT BECOMES AFTERWARDS WHICH APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE THAT THIS TINGE IS THE EFFECT OF SOME CHANGE AFTER DEATH AND CANNOT THEREFORE HAVE ANY EFFECTUPON VISION THE ORIFICE HAS BEEN SUPPOSED TO ACCOUNT FOR A SMALL OBJECT BECOMING INVISIBLE WHEN PLACED AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE EYE AND BROUGHT OPPOSITE A PARTICULAR PART OF THE RETINA THIS HOWEVER CANNOT BE THE CASE AS ITS SITUATION IN THE RETINA DOES NOT CORRESPOND WITH THE PART OPPOSED TO THE OBJECT WHEN REN DERED INVISIBLEIN THE RETINA OF THE EYE THE ORIFICE ITSELF IS PROBABLY TOO SMALL TO PRODUCE ANY DEFECT IN VISION AS THE TRUNKS OF THE BLOODVESSELS WHICH RAMIFY UPON THE RETINA COVER A LARGER SPACE THAN THISORIFICE FOR A CONSIDERABLE EXTENT WITHOUT OBSTRUCTING THE SIGHT OF ANY PART OF THE OBJECT WHILE MY OBSERVATIONS WERE CONFINED TO THE HUMAN EYE I WAS LED TO CONSIDER THIS ORIFICE AS A LYMPHATIC VESSEL PASSING FROM THE VITREOUS HUMOUR THROUGH THE RETINA BUT COULD BRING NO ABSOLUTE PROOF OF ITS BEING SO THIS OPINION WAS STRENGTH ENED BY FINDING THAT IN THE MONKEY THE ORIFICE WAS ONLY REN DERED VISIBLE WHEN THE RETINA BECAME OPAQUE AND IT HAS SINCE BEEN CORROBORATED BY A DISTINCT TUBE BEING MET WITH IN THE EYES OF SHEEP AND BULLOCKS FHAT A CHANGE MUST BE RCLONSTANTLY TAKING PLACE IN THE CRYS TALLINE AND VITREOUS HUMOURS TO PRESERVE TO THEM THE NECESSARY DEGREE OF TRANSPARENCY CAN HARDLY BE DOUBTED AND THAT THE ABSORBENT VESSELS WHICH PERFORM THAT OFFICE SHOULD HAVE ONE COMM OI TRNK WHICH FOLLOWS TIHE COURSE OF THE ARTERY AND VEIN PERFECTLY AIGREES WITH WHIAT TAKES AACE IN OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY IN THE HUMA N EYE AIND THAT OF THE NMONKEY THE ARTERY IS IN THE CENTRE OF THE OPTIC NERVE BUT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN TOO CIR CUTLO TAT COURE FOR THE LVMPHATIC VESSEL TO FOLLOW AND BY GO ING THROUGH THE RETINA AT SOME

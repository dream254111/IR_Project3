smell in the crustacea has been the subject of but few investigations Putnam Graber Bateson Dearborn Spaulding and others have made observations on the reactions of various decapods to food at a distance from the body although they were not primarily concerned in tracing the seat of the olfactory reactions Herrick working on the lobster found that most parts of the body were sensitive to ammonia and clam juice Experiments of Nagel and Bethe 2 indicate that in the decapods the first antennae have an important olfactory func tion although both these investigators regard the olfactory sense organs as not exclusively located in these appendages Nagel worked with Pagurus Astacus and Carcinus Removal of the antennules of Pagurus was followed by reactions to chemical stimuli although these were not so pronounced as before the operation Astacus in the presence of food was found to show lively movements of the antennules followed by movements of the mouth parts and legs Carcinus showed the same move metnts of the mouth parts and antennae in the presence of food but it was only when food came into actual contact with the mouth parts that efforts were made to secure it Nagels experi ments led him to conclude that sight and touch play a greater part in locating food than the sense of smell Bethe found that if a piece of meat is thrown into a dish with several Carcinus there is no reaction at first After several seconds the antennules begin to wave rapidly and the maxillipeds move slowly back and forth The animals nearest the piece of meat I Bibliotheca Zoologica Bd I8

animals begin to react they move about and usually in quite a direct line toward the meat The nearer they approach the food the faster they go That the eye plays little part is evidenced by the fact that blinded forms go toward the meat with just as much cer tainty If a piece of meat is passed over the rocks at the bottom of the aquarium a Carcinus will follow this scent and often pick up every stone which has been in contact with the meat and pass it to the mouth but as soon as the stones come in contact with the maxillipeds they are rejected If the antennules are removed Carcinus reacts to food but only when it is placed a short distance from the mouth parts The latter are regarded by Bethe as also sensitive to chemical stimuli In the amphipod Amphithoe1 one of the present writers found that the antennules were important olfactory organs but that there remained a certain but much diminished power to detect food at a distance from the mouth parts after the antennules or even the antennules and the antennae were removed Other species of amphipods were found to make exploring movements of the antennules when in the presence of food Nagels experiments with amphipods and isopods failed to elicit any positive response although some species gave negative responses to disagreeable or irritating substances The terrestrial isopods Oniscus Porcellio and Armadillo he found to be quite insensitive to strong substances like cedar oil and benzol It is not difficult however to obtain very decided reactions from ter restrial isopods to the vapor of acetic acid and ammonia even after removal of the antenne Many papers have appeared dealing with the organs of smell in crustacea but conclusions regarding their functions have been based more on morphological grounds than on the results of experiment One of the most recent papers on the chemical sense of crustacea is that of Bell2 who worked on the reactions of the crayfish Bell applied meat juice by means of a fine pointed pipette to various parts of the body To render it evi 1 BIOLOGICAL BULLETIN Vol 2 p I65 1901 2Jour Comp Neur and Psych I6 299 I906 I56THE SEAT OF SMELL IN THE CRAYFISH dent when the substance came in contact with the animal it was colored with eosin or carmine It was found that stimulation of various parts of the body would elicit a response The animal moved its mouth parts became restless moved the small cheli peds about and sooner or later attempted to go toward the source of stimulus The responses varied somewhat according to the region to which the stimulus was applied but there was a marked tendency as we have also found for the first reaction to manifest itself by a movement of the part most directly stimulated The antennules antennae mouth parts and tips of the large and small chelipeds were found to be organs of especial sensitiveness We have repeated Bells experiments with meat juice and verified in the main his results Bell however did not test his conclusions by removal of certain organs or by operations on the nervous system One is never quite sure that by using chemicals which diffuse through the water only the organ is stimulated to which the stimulus is applied It was thought desirable not only for this reason but on account of determining more definitely the role of certain organs in chemoreception to observe the reactions of crayfish after the removal of the antennules and antennae and after the destruction of the brain or the division of the nerve cord The outer ramus of the antennules bears in addition to the kinds of setae found on the antennae and other parts of the body certain peculiar clubshaped organs which have generally been considered the end organs of the sense of smell These organs are absent on the inner ramus and on the antennae as well as other parts of the body Organs of a similar character are common in other crustacea being in many cases more abundantly developed in the male This circumstance as well as the fact that removal of the antennules diminishes the response to olfac tory stimuli renders it quite probable that these clubshaped organs perform the function which has so often been assigned to them In a series of experiments we have compared the reac tions of crayfish with the outer ramus of the antennules removed with the reactions of normal animals and individuals otherwise operated on The rami were removed several days before the ani mals were experimented with in order to eliminate any effect of shock I57S J HOLMES AND E S HOMUTH on the reactions All of the specimens were kept forthe same period without food were placed in the same kind of dishes and treated in all respects as nearly as possible in the same way Only indi viduals which had been resting quietly for some minutes were employed for experiment If any reaction was produced by the movements of the observer the crayfish was not used for experi ment until it had been left for a considerable time and became perfectly quiet A piece of meat was very carefully introduced into the water with a long fine forceps and held a quarter of an inch above the rostrum If ones movements are exceedingly slow it is possible to work around crayfish even when recently brought in from the field without exciting alarm The number of seconds was noted before any of the feeding responses of the legs or mouth parts were set up Sometimes such movements appear to arise spontaneously and therefore only those cases were counted in which these movements eventuated in seizing and devouring the meat In three sets of experiments performed at different times the time reactions of the crayfish were as follows Outer ramus removed Inner ramus removed Both rami removed IO Normal animal 46 Outer ramus removed Inner ramus removed Both rami

striking enough way that removal of the outer branch of the antennules is followed by a much greater loss of sensitiveness to olfactory stimuli than is caused by removal of the inner ramus But they also show that crayfish with the inner ramus removed react less promptly than do normal animals We may conclude from these experiments that the part most sensitive to olfactory stimuli is the outer ramus of the anten nules but that the inner ramus is also to a certain extent sensitive to the same kind of stimuli Specimens with both rami removed re spond to meat juice or pieces of meat placed near the tip of the large second antennae It is scarcely possible that any chemical could diffuse to other parts of the body before the reaction takes place and hence the second antennae must have an olfactory function also Specimens in which both antennules and antennae were removed showed a marked power of responding to bits of meat or meat juice placed near the mouth parts or the tips of the chela The small chelipeds were found especially sensitive to substances placed near the tip By very carefully applying the tip of a pipette which had been drawn out into a long slender tube near one of the small chelae and slowly forcing out a little meat juice one usually sees a slight grasping movement of the chelae often at first a small twitch of the dactyl followed by movements of reaching about These movements are followed by exploring movements of the other chelipeds chewing move ments of the mouth parts and by a turning of the body toward the stimulus Animals in which the brain was destroyed were also experi mented with The crayfish was securely fastened to facilitate working upon it With a finepointed scalpel a piece of the cara pace about one fourth of an inch square was cut out just over the brain After destroying the brain the piece of the carapace was carefully replaced and the edges sealed with asphalt varnish The animal was then kept out of water until the asphalt had dried and the wound sealed After a few days the animal was experi I59S J HOLMES AND E S HOMUTH mented with and showed marked responses from the mouth parts and chelipeds When the chelipeds were rubbed with a piece of filter paper the substance was seized but rejected if passed to the mouth parts When meat was pressed against the chelipeds in the same way it was seized more eagerly produced a greater de gree of excitement and was generally eaten To make sure that this was not due to a difference in the consistency of the two articles two wads of filter paper were taken upon one of which was pressed some meat juice The two wads were applied to the chelipeds in the same way but the one with the meat juice was more quickly seized and was generally passed to the mouth parts and swallowed In some instances the pure filter paper was swallowed but this was very rare The chelipeds were also stimulated simultaneously the one with pure filter paper the other with filter paper soaked in meat juice The animal almost invariably turned toward the side with the meat juice and grasped more vigorously on that side The stimuli were frequently transposed but this did not affect the result the reaction to the paper with the meat juice was the more vigorous In one crayfish the nerve cord was cut across directly behind the mouth parts and in front of the large chelipeds The result of this operation is to somewhat paralyze the animal especially the anterior chelipeds which are drawn up under the body Ob jects that touch the chela are frequently passed to the mouth but again rejected A bit of meat however is chewed and swal lowed although this act requires a much longer time than in the normal animal In some cases the chewing movements ceased before the food was swallowed The chelipeds when stimulated by meat grasp it more eagerly than they seize innutritious mate rials and the animal in general shows a greater degree of ex citement The experiments recorded show that the outer ramus of the antennules which bear the socalled olfactory setae are especially sensitive to olfactory stimuli  that the inner ramus of the anten nules and the antennae are also sensitive to olfactory stimuli but to a less degree and that the olfactory sense is developed in other parts of the body especially the mouth parts and tips of the chelipeds I60

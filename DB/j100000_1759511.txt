not of silkreeling and while reelingestablishments mnay undertake to cholce the cocoons brought in by the raisers in their ilmmediate neighborhood or by agents the marketing of fresh cocoons must necessarily be limited in time and dis tance They cannot bear pressure without injury and all baled cocoons must needs be choked One is hardly justified in comparing the mnethods of colonial times with those in vogue today in France where modern steam filatures and railroads have produced such profound modifications We cannot see how choked cocoons which have but onethird to one fourth the weight of fresh cocoons can be marketed at the same rates as the fresh cocoons The termn  green  cocoons is often used in English as the equiv alent of fresh cocoons but as quoted in the French markets of today the word green vert refers to those of a green or greenish color Perhaps this may explain the puzzle C V  I iLRE Thermometer exposure In No 58 of Science Professor Menidenlhall calls attention to interesting differences of the minima temperatures on cold still nights of the winter I agree with him that a difference of exposure and prox imity to buildings may explain a difference in read ing but it is impossible to explain by them alone the enormous difference noticed in Columbus 273 F There must have been besides one or another of the following conditions probably both When the con ditions are favorable to radiation and the night is still the lowest strata of the air are mostly cooled by contact with the cold upper surface of the ground and more so if there is snow and a socalled inversion of temperature is produced The temperature rises from the lowest strata to a certain height Examples of this can be found in the observations at Pulkova near St Petersburg A thermometer placed at the height of seventyeight feet was almost constantly higher than one at six feet above ground at eight PM In August on clear days the mean difference was 21 F and once in Septegmber it was 52 F In the months from December to March when the ground is covered with snow even at one PM the upper thermometer was higher than the lower  the mean difference on clear days of December and January at one PM amounting to 13 F and once it amounted to 41 F The same results Were obtained by experiments made at Kew by direction of the meteorological offlice The minima were lower at a height of twentyone feet above ground than at a hundred and twenty feet and on one occasion at nine PM during a fog the latter was higher by 108 F than the former Now most of the signalservice stations must have comparatively high minima not only because they are mostly located in the interior of cities but be cause the thermometers are often placed very high above the ground at the level of the fifth or sixth story of city buildings Probably the stations of the Ohio state service are placed lower Besides the height of thermometers above the ground what I call the Itopographical conditions are of importance At an equal distance from the level of the ground under conditions favorable to radiation there will be much lower minima in valleys than on hills This is caused by the descent of the coldest and heaviest air to the valley and also by the fact that in a valley the air is in the vicinity of a greater surface of the ground During the anti cyclone of Dec 1930 1879 the summit of Mont NCE 563 Verdun near Lyons France had a moan tempera ture of 17 C and the Pare de la Ttte dOr in the city situated four hundred and fifty metres lower a mean of71 C The mean minima differed by more than 12C Very likely the observations of the state service at Columnbus were made on lower ground than those of the signalservice Where anti cyclones in winter are common in high latitudes with the ground covered with snow the mean temperatures of the winter months must be considerably colder in valleys than on the surrounding hills and moun tain slopes as the insolation during the day inter feres but slightly and not at all during some days at points beyond the polar circles with the equilibrium of air strata obtained during the night This cold of the nights in valleys subjecting plants to freezing on nights when those that grow on hills are spared is well known Perhaps it is less noticed in the United States as there low temperatures are ofteter accompanied by high winds than in Europe The olivecultivators in southern France and the coffeegrowers in the hilly districts of the province of San Paulo southern Brazil know this so well that they do not plant their trees in valleys from fear of frosts A WOETKOF St Petersburg Dalmanites in the lower carboniferous rocks During a recent geological excursion near this city one of our party Mr Henry Lane found and pointed out to me a trilobite which I extracted from the stone myself The rock on which we were working was the upper part of the Cuyahoga shale of the Waverly group of Ohio now universally I believe referred to the lower carboniferous system The only genus hitherto reported from these rocks in America is Phillipsia with the exception of two species of Proe tus scarcely distinguishable from Phillipsia The specimen in question however distinctly differs from both of these in the pygidium the only part yet ob tained Instead of the evenly rounded and margined tail of those genera it shows the flabellate and tim briate form of Dalmanites The occurrence of this genus or of this type of trilobite so high in the geo logical series is both surprising and uncanonical E W CLAYrPOLE

find that two of them least perfect are where wires cross the frame of the blind Two words of mine three lines from the bottom of the page require correction The size of the image is not very nearly as described but exactly so If this image could become an actual screen then its image in turn would be the farther screen and any line through a wirecrossing in either of the three screens would meet the other two at points quasi homologous to each other JAMES EDIWAiM OLIVER Cornell university April 29

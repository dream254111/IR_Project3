j100195,The Jewish Quarterly Review,1451403,Studies in the Books of Samuel II,i263225,STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUEL BY M H SEGAL NewcastleuponTyne II THE COMPOSITION OF THE BOOK 63 ch 22 The author continues his narrative in ch 22 There is no reason whatever to doubt as some critics do the genuineness of 22 35 As soon as David openly becomes an outlaw his whole clan joins him probably out of fear of Sauls revenge But David would not expose his aged parents to the dangers of his roving existence and so he entrusted them to the protection of the king of Moab He was encouraged to do so both by the enmity which existed between Saul and Moab cf above  49 57 and also by his connexion with the land of Moab through Ruth his reputed ancestress cf R Isaiahs note ad loc That there was a prophet in Davids company is not at all surprising considering the unfriendly relations which existed between Samuel the head of the prophetical order I9 20 a and Saul Gad may have belonged to the school of Ramah where David had vainly sought an asylum The passage is however fragmentary It tells us only indirectly that David stayed at the rrnm which appears from ver 5 to have been outside Sauls territory But it does not tell us precisely where the int was how David lived there or how Gad came to him  Continued from vol VI pp 267 ff and pp 555 ff 75THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW 64 Many critics declare the account of Davids visit to Nob in ver 9 ff to be independent of and contradictory to the account in 21 2Io and they assign the account in ch 2 I to E and the account in this chapter to J But this is altogether incorrect The two accounts are interdependent and supplementary The dependence of this chapter on ch 21 is evident Doeg is here introduced as a person already known to the reader cf above  6i The clause  3 Kietm is not intended to describe the person of Doeg but only to explain his presence at the court like the explanation of his presence at Nob given in 2T 8 a niry in ver IO and on5 in ver 13 evidently refer back to 21 4 f It is true that here the bread is not described as sacred but that is because it is immaterial to the charge of con spiracy brought against the priest whether the bread was sacred or profane It is also possible that Doeg did not see what kind of bread the priest had given to David Likewise lnWin n4 in in ver Io and mn in ver 13 are dependent on 21 Io The particular detail that the sword was that of the Philistine champion is perhaps mentioned by Doeg in order to make sure that the king will believe him as it might have been known that the sanctuary did not harbour within it any weapons cf Exod 20 25 Perhaps also Doeg intended to intensify the kings resent ment by the allusion to the famous exploit of David which was the first cause of the kings jealousy and hatred It is characteristic that Saul himself says only inm without nw2n ver 13 being unable to recall with his own lips the great achievement of his hated rival Budde op cit 226 says that ver i ob hinkt    storend nacl As a matter of fact this clause with the verb at the end is intended to be very emphatic and impressive On the other hand ch 22 76STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL gives an additional detail not found in ch 21 viz the inquiry of the oracle But as we have stated before  6I 21 o1 ends rather abruptly and seems to be fragmentary It may be that our author purposely omitted this detail in ch 2I because he knew that the reader would learn it from ch 22 where it would have to be mentioned as one of the chief counts in the indictment against the priest cf 22 15 whereas in ch 21 which tells the story from Davids point of view the inquiry of the oracle was of minor importance Bread and a sword were to David in his plight a more vital necessity than an inquiry of the oracle Thus just as ch 22 presupposes ch 21 so ch 21 presupposes ch 22 which proves that both chapters are by one and the same hand viz by the autlior of our book 65 Critics hold ver I9 to be an interpolation modelled on 15 3b because the verse interrupts the connexion between ver 18 and ver 20 and because its statement is improbable One may ask if this is not the right place for the verse where else could the writer have placed it  Not before ver I8 nor far down below after ver 23 nor any where between vers 2023 The argument that Doeg could not have slain singlehanded all the inhabitants of Nob is of no force nn need not mean that Doeg slew them all with his own hand any more than for example Tl in I5 7 means that Saul slew all the Amalekites with his own hand The kings attendants may have hesitated to lay their hands on the priests but this hesitation of the courtiers would not have prevented Doeg from obtaining outside the court plenty of assistance in his nefarious work The occur rence of the phraseology of this verse in I5 3 b only strengthens our contention that both ch 15 and ch 22 emanate from one and the same author Note the omission 77THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW here of in given in 15 3b Camels were an important possession of the marauding Amalekites cf 30 17 c but useless to the settled priests of Nob and therefore not found among their cattle 66 ch 23 23 I13 is evidently by our author Note the references in ver 3 to 22 5 in vers 6 9 b to 22 20 ff and in vers 7 ff to 22 6 Ver 6 which seeks to explain how David came to possess an ephod may very well belong to the author and need not be a gloss Naturally it had to precede ver 9 b but in order that it may not interrupt the context it is placed at the beginning of the paragraph The contention of the critics that this verse should have preceded ver 2 is of no force There were other means of inquiring of God besides the ephod The inquiry in ver 2 may have been made through the prophet Gad Ver 14 is as shown by clause b a summary of the history of David during the whole period David dwelt in the wilderness namely in the fastnesses he dwelt in the high land namely in the wilderness of Ziph35 Ver I5 where we should point with LXX i for MT 13 is introductory to vers I6I8 David was afraid of Saul while he was in Horshah in the wilderness and Jonathan came out to him and encouraged him and concluded a covenant with him We hold that this passage belongs to our author Hitherto the author has not recorded the wellknown fact of the existence of a covenant between David and Jonathan cf II 9 3 21 7 for as we have shown above  52 58 I8 3 20 10 are not the authors but belong to interpola tions In view of the breach between Saul and Jonathan 35 1It3 is obviously a more comprehensive term than nrlnl13 Similarly II3 the mountainous region comprised a wider area than 9l4 131n  78STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 79 revealed by 22 8 cf also 20 30 ff we need not be surprised that Jonathan dared to visit David in defiance of his father 67 Ver 19 is found again in a shorter form in 26 I Since as we shall show later  72 ch 26 was embodied by our author in his work from an older source we may conclude that he deliberately borrowed the phraseology of ver 19 from 26 i That our verse is not a duplicate of 26 i as the critics assert is evident from the fact that the story which it introduces in vers 2028 has nothing in common with the story of ch 26 The narrative of vers I928 seems to be the sequel of ver 14 above and is intended to illustrate the statement in ver 14 b We see no reason to deny the passage to our author Ver I9 b is best interpreted as follows David hides himself in our region now in the fastnesses now in Horshah now in the hill of the Hakilah Had the latter two localities been intended to serve as a specification of the first  nln3 they would no doubt have been introduced by the relative wK like the last clause of the verse nwt ptnn This interpretation is further supported by the request of Saul that they should return and find out the exact spot in which David was hiding If the Ziphites had only men tioned one locality as Davids hidingplace and had more over added the names of other places in order to describe and specify its exact situation then the whole of Sauls speech in vers 22 23 would seem both superfluous and irrational 68 ch 24 In ch 24 the author continues the story of Davids adventures The critics have denied the integrity of vers 58 They hold that the present order of the verses is unnatural Hence some of them propose theTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW following rearrangement vers 5 a 7 8 a 5 b 6 8 b This new order seems at first sight plausible enough But the question arises as H P Smith op cit 2I7 observes how did this complicated dislocation arise and what was its cause  Further we may ask how did the writer divine that David had felt in his heart remorse for cutting off the skirt of Sauls mantle ver 6 unless David had evinced this feeling by some speech or act as is really the case in our present text where he gives expression to this feeling by his speech in ver 7  H P Smith seeks to solve the difficulty in the usual fashion of the critics he holds the incident of the cutting off of the skirt of Sauls mantle to be a later inven tion and proposes to cut out as an interpolation vers 5 b 6 and also ver 12 which he says is as readily spared as vers 5 b 6  But ver 12 cannot be spared For ver 13 a can have sense and force only after ver I2 b where David demonstrates his own innocence and also charges Saul with seeking his life No such charge is brought against Saul in ver I I Again it will not do even if we delete only the first half ofver 12 up to Tnmnn for nrKi yv presupposes a demonstrative proof of his innocence such as is pro duced only by ver 12 a As a matter of fact the present order of the verses is not unnatural It is both rational and true psychologically The alleged difficulties are simply the creation of the critics themselves The course of the narrative is as follows Saul enters the cave in the recesses of which David and his men lie in hiding ver 4 David is urged by his men to slay Saul with his own hand  i5 nfvly ver 5 Moved by their words and by his own impulse David rises and approaches Saul stealthily but his chivalry and magnanimity are suddenly aroused and he shrinks from the dishonourable act of slaying his enemy by 8o0STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 8i stealth All that he can bring himself to do is to cut off the skirt of Sauls mantle ver 5 But even this harmless deed arouses in his generous heart feelings of selfreproach and shame ver 6 He returns to his men and explains that he cannot bring himself to lay hands on the Anointed of the Lord ver 7 and energetically prevents them from attacking the unsuspecting king ver 8 The cutting off of the skirt is thus seen to be an essential detail of the story It may also have been intended to bear a symbolic significance like the rending of the mantle in 15 278 i Kings ii 3031 69 All the critics agree that ver 14 is a gloss They argue that David would not have chosen that moment for displaying his familiarity with the gnomic wisdom of the ancients But the speech ascribed to David is not intended to be regarded as a stenographic report of what David actually said on the occasion Hebrew authors may like Thucydides and Livy have put speeches of their own composition into the mouths of their heroes Why should not the narrator desirous of impressing a moral lesson on the minds of his readers have put such a proverb into the mouth of David And if this verse be a gloss how is one to explain the repetition in clause b of ver 13 b H P Smith objects that David would not dare to call Saul ypv But David does not mean to brand Saul as wicked He cites the proverb that evil brings its own punishment 36 only in order to explain his own assurance in ver 13 a and to warn Saul that a wicked act against him would inevitably bring upon its doer condign retribution Budde op cit 229 condemns also vers 2123 a as re dactional These verses may not indeed be quite historical 36 Cf the Rabbinic comment in Makkot io b VOL VIII GTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW but there is no reason why the original narrator should not have shared the general belief of his contemporaries that even at that early stage of his career David had already been recognized by Saul himself as the only legitimate successor to the throne of Israel Cf our remarks above  25 70 ch 25 Ch 25 stands out from among the other chapters of this section by its distinctive individuality of style and diction The narrative is rich in detail and in local colour full of life and movement and distinguished by a number of characteristic phrases and expressions Note ver 3 45n yr ver 6 ver 8  nD  ver 12 VDs11 ver 14 tDnm LIg  ver 26 J1 Jr Pwl  ver 29 b We have however no reason to deny the chapter to our author we should rather conclude that he utilized some older written material from which he derived the most characteristic portions of his narrative Cf vers 424 with 27 3 30 5 II 3 23 13 ff The critics agree that ver i a is an interpolation from 28 3 But what is the purpose of this interpolation here Only one of them has attempted an answer to this question viz Budde op cit 231 who thinks that the interpolation was made in order not to let the reader lose sight of the nation But why should this reminder of the existence of the nation if such reminder was necessary have been made exactly here and not in any other of the many chapters since ch I8  We think it likely that there was in the mind of the writer some connexion between the two clauses of this verse It seems that he meant to imply that through Samuels death David enjoyed in the wilder ness of Maon LXX a period of rest from Sauls persecu tion It may be that Samuels death kept Saul back from pursuing David Samuels followers the prophets and the priests who were friendly to David may perhaps have 82STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 83 begun to show signs of restiveness now that the calming influence of Samuel had been removed For with all his opposition to Saul Samuel retained to the end of his life a certain personal attachment to the man he had raised to the throne of Israel cf 15 I 35 On the other hand it is also possible that the connexion between clause a and clause b of this verse is purely of a chronological character In any case it is certain that the critics are wrong in regarding clause a as being derived from 28 3a On the contrary the statement seems to be original here where it occupies the place of a principal affirmation in the course of the historical narrative whereas in 28 3 it serves like the following clause merely a subordinate purpose viz to prepare the reader for the story of the raising of Samuels spirit by the necromancer 71 Budde loc cit is of opinion that originally 25 2 ff followed immediately upon 23 28 But the sense of security and repose which characterizes ch 25 is out of accord with the trepidation and hairbreadth escapes of ch 23 From 25 7 b 1516 it is obvious that David and his men had stayed in one locality for a considerable length of time and had freely and openly fraternized with the natives This is quite intelligible after the assurance given by Saul in 24 1722 but is inconsistent with 23 19 22 23 where David is described as hiding in secret retreats and in danger of being betrayed by the natives 72 chs 24 26 The striking similarities between ch 26 and ch 24 present an interesting problem as to the origin and mutual relationship of the two chapters The critics solve the problem by their usual method of declaring the two accounts to be independent duplicates of the same story At first sight this solution seems quite plausible G 2THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW but a closer comparison of the two chapters proves it to be altogether inadequate to account for all the facts of the problem Let us examine both the similarities and the differences of the two stories The main outline of the adventure is common to both stories In both stories David gets Saul into his power without the kings knowing it and his men seek to slay Saul stealthily but David prevents them When Saul is out of danger David proves to him his innocence and complains of Sauls ceaseless persecu tions and Saul confesses his guilt There are also striking similarities in language cf  iw   lnm w 6N nrw in nN r pn in 26 2 and 24 3 nw irn in 26 3 b with 24 4b 26 ii a with 24 7 26 17 1m1 15pn with 24 17 26 20b with 24 I5 On the other hand there are also important differences in the general presentation of the story and in the details The temper of the two men is differently represented in each of the stories In 24 Davids speech is very bitter and almost vindictive vers 1oI6 in 26 on the other hand it is respectful and supplicatory vers 1820 Again in 24 Saul is profuse humble and remorseful vers 1822 in 26 he is brief and dignified ver 21 Further the style in 24 is diffuse and verbose as compared with the conciseness and terseness of 26 There are also marked differences in the details of the story 26 takes place in the wilderness of Ziph 24 in the wilderness of Engedi In 26 it is the Ziphites who betray David in 24 the informers are unnamed In 26 David accompanied only by one follower goes down to the encampment of Saul in 24 Saul comes to the hidingplace of David and all his band In 26 the proof of Davids innocence is the spear and pitcher of water in 24 it is the skirt of the kings mantle In 26 it is Abishai 84STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 85 who wishes to slay the king in 24 David is incited to slay him with his own hand In 26 David first addresses Abner and the king only after the latter had spoken to him in 24 David addresses Saul straightway and Abners presence is entirely ignored Now the identity of the main outline certainly proves the original identity of the adven ture On the other hand the differences in detail preclude the assumption that the two accounts in their literary form are both derived from a common source or that one account is derived from the other Yet the linguistic similarities demonstrate the dependence of one account upon the other viz the dependence of ch 24 upon ch 26 which is no doubt the older of the stories37 The only solution which will satisfy all the facts of the problem is the following The writer of ch 24 who as we remarked above  68 is the author of our book knew ch 26 in its present literary form from some old document But he also knew from oral tradition a story of a similar character which however contained so many striking differences in detail as to lead him to believe that the two stories were not identical and that David and Saul really had two such adventures Judging by our modern criteria of historical criticism we may think that this belief of his was wrong but we have no right to impose our modern ideas upon an ancient writer and to assert as the critics seem to do that his belief in the independence of the two stories was unjusti fiable and impossible from his own point of view The story which he found in his old source he reproduced in ch 26 but the story which he derived from oral tradition he related in his own words in ch 24 In this latter composi 37 Cf TheniusLohr Sanmuel XLV H P Smith op cit 230 Stenning in Hastings Dictionary of the Bible vol IV 338 aTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tion he was consciously or unconsciously strongly in fluenced by the phraseology of the older story hence the linguistic similarities between ch 26 and ch 24 We have already found our author elsewhere repeating in his own compositions phrases and expressions belonging to the older documents which he incorporated into his narrative cf IO 23 b with 9 2b 15 19 b with I4 32 a i6 i2 a with 17 42 b 23 19 with 26 I see  28 50 67 We should of course expect 26 i to begin with In lty Itl or tn 1l3we2 but our author seems to have left the expression as he found it in his document either through an oversight or because he was unwilling to tamper with the text of the document The assumption that the author of our book is responsible for the appearance in his narrative of both ch 24 and ch 26 will help to explain the resentful tone of Davids speech in 24 Io16 as compared with the more calm and respectful tone of his speech in 26 1820 In ch 24 his mind was still full of the bitter feelings engendered by Sauls pursuit described just before in 23 258 In ch 26 on the other hand David was still fresh from the enjoyment of a long repose in the wilderness of Maon ch 2538 These facts will also account for the difference in the bearing of Saul in ch 24 and ch 26 73 This solution of ours is also strongly supported by another consideration According to the analysis of the critics 23 1924 23 is the duplicate of ch 26 The Ziphites thus informed against David only once and Saul confessed his guilt only once If so it is incomprehensible that after the assurance just given in 26 21 25 an assurance which had never yet been broken David suddenly despairs 38 It is possible that the source used by the author in his composition of ch 25 cf above  71 was the same as that from which he derived ch 26 86STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 87 so utterly of his safety that he resolves upon taking the desperate step of going over to the hereditary foe the heathen Philistines among whom he would be forced as he says himself 26 I9 to abjure his God 27 I ff But according to our explanation Davids resolve becomes quite clear and intelligible He had been pursued by Saul on three occasions in 23 1928 in ch 24 and in ch 26 He had been three times betrayed by his neighbours and twice by the same people the Ziphites 23 9  24 2 b 26 I Sauls promises and confessions had been proved to be deceptive the promise made in Engedi 24 1822 had been broken by the subsequent pursuit into the wilderness of Ziph 26 2 ff Most of the natives of the Negeb were hostile and ungrateful like Nabal 25 10 or treacherous like the Ziphites In these circumstances with the repeated experience of danger and betrayal it is quite natural and intelligible for David to despair of the future safety of himself his wives and his followers in the land of the Judean Negeb and to resolve upon taking the extreme step of flight into the land of the Philistines 74 ch 27 The author continues his narrative in ch 27 Some critics have questioned the integrity of the chapter They hold that ver iX contradicts vers 56 But ver II says only that David had to bring his spoil to Akish at Gath not that David lived at Gath Had David been living at Gath his duplicity towards the king would no doubt have been soon discovered either by betrayal or by an unguarded remark from his men That David refrained in his raids from attacking his own tribes men and their allies is only what we should expect of him This consideration for his own people is also confirmed by 30 26 cf also 25 I516 21 28 n nmn5n viz againstTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the heathen enemies of the Judeans and their allies The confidence placed in David by Akish ver 12 29 3 6 9 and the ignorance of the Philistines of the real character of Davids expeditions prove conclusively that David lived at Ziklag and not at Gath Hence vers 712 presuppose vers 56which proves the unity of the whole chapter Davids residence at Ziklag is also confirmed by 29 4 and ch 30 This disposes of H P Smiths conjecture that vers 56 are an interpolation39 75 chs 2831 The story of Sauls death in his last war with the Philistines includes two episodes viz Sauls interview with the spirit of Samuel 28 325 and the Amalekite raid on Ziklag ch 30 The latter being part of the story of David forms undoubtedly an integral por tion of our section Chs 2930 are therefore by the same hand as 28 12 and as these two verses are the sequel of ch 27 we may safely assign 28 12 and chs 29 30 to the author of our book As regards the other episode critics are agreed that it is an interpolation from another document but on very insufficient evidence They argue that the passage breaks the context but that is natural to an episode Again they point out that the tone and style are different from those of the preceding and following pieces but that too is adequately accounted for by the profound difference of the subjectmatter Finally the critics discover a discrepancy between this piece and ch 29 Here in ver 4 the Philistines are encamped at Shunem and the Israelites at Gilboa whereas in 29 I the Philistines are at Aphek and the Israelites at some fountain in Jezreel But the fact is that 28 425 is posterior in time to ch 29 as is evident 3U Cf also Kamphausen in ZATW i886 pp go ff and Budde op cit 231 f 88STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 89 from 28 5 where Saul was already surveying the Philistine camp Ch 29 describes the situation at the opening of the campaign and the mobilization of the Philistine hosts while 28 4 shows us the position of the two armies at the eve of the battle cf 28 19   nK linni Aphek probably identical with the one mentioned in 4 I served as the place of muster for the various Philistine armies 29 I does not say that the Philistines encamped at Aphek only that their hosts assembled there for the purpose of moving northwards while Jezreel was the place of the first encamp ment of the Israelites When the Philistines marched from Aphek on Jezreel 29 I b the Israelites out of fear of the enemy moved backwards to Gilboa southeast of Jezreel The Philistines then for some strategical reason moved up farther north to Shunem where they pitched their encamp ment 28 4 and from there pushed back southwards to attack the Israelites on the heights of Gilboa 31 I II I 21 76 The nocturnal scene at Endor must have taken place at the time of Davids fight with the Amalekites which latter occurred three days after David had left Aphek cf the chronological references in 30 I a 13 b  II I I b2 a but before 30 26 For this reason the author placed the story of Endor where he did and not after ch 30 as Budde has injudiciously done in his badly deranged text in Haupts Polychrome Bible Besides this chronological reason the author also had an aesthetic reason for placing 28 325 before chs 2930 viz to afford the reader some relief in chs 2930 between the depressing effects of the ghostly scene at Endor and the gory battlefield of Gilboa in ch 31 Chs 2930 are thus treated by the author as an episode and a break in the course of his narrative This explainsTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the wording of the opening clause of ch 31 as a subordinate statement Wrn6j nwi i The Philistines were fighting viz during the time covered by the preceding account cf Rashis note ad loc tlpK ltp 5 nln irm nn m On the other hand the Chronicler who had not previously men tioned anything of the Philistine war makes of these words a principal statement using the perfect tense  l rn mt This disposes of H P Smiths hasty conjecture op cit 252 that our text in 3I I requires emendation in accordance with the reading of the Chronicler I Chron Io I We therefore see no reason to deny 28 325 to the author of our book to whom this scene must have appeared as the final and supreme climax in the story of his great hero the prophet Samuel It is admitted by practically all critics 40 that this story is by the same hand as ch 15 In fact 28 I7 points back expressly to 15 28 But we have already assigned ch I5 to the author of our book  50 Hence we conclude that this story as well as the rest of the section comprising chs 2831 is the work of our author This view is sup ported by the use of D in vers 15 16 which reminds us of I6 I4 23 and by the introductory character of vers 34 The latter is evidently an essential part of the story and not the work of an interpolator On the other hand vers 1819 seems to have suffered expansion by a late hand Ver I8 is rather diffuse and clause b in ver 19 is practically a repetition of the first part of clause a Perhaps the whole of vers I8I9 a a to insnw is a later addition 77 II ch I The narrative of Sauls death is continued in II i which describes the reception of the news by David The chapter is homogeneous and as it continues the story of i 31 it must be assigned to the author of our book 40 Budde op cit 233 is the only exception 90STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 9I Ver 4 is reminiscent in its phraseology and climactic arrangement of I 4 i6bI7 cf Ralbags note ad loc With ver 14 compare I 24 7 26 9 ii Some critics however hold that vers 6II I316 belong to another document that ver 5 is a redactional link connecting vers 14 which form the continuation of I 31 with the contradictory account given in the interpolation vers 6II 1316 while ver 12 is a later addition because lamentation and fasting were at the stage of that verse still premature But as H P Smith asks op cit 254 where did vers 6I 13I6 come from  We may further ask what was the original continuation of ver 4 It could not have been ver 17 for we require first some such statement as is contained in ver 11  much less could it have been 2 I even if we omit PnN 4nr for David would certainly have paid some honour to the fallen heroes before proceeding to utilize the new situation for his own benefit Finally is it likely that in this alleged original document to which vers 14 belong David accepted the truth of the tidings in ver 4 without adequate proof and without inquiring for further details The truth is that we obtain a logical and con sistent account of the affair only if we accept vers 117 as one continuous and homogeneous narrative After the mans general statement in ver 4 David naturally inquires for the source of his knowledge ver 5 The answer to this is given in vers 6Io Convinced of the truth of the death of Saul and Jonathan by the irrefutable evidence supplied by the mans producing Sauls regalia David and his men perform the usual rites of mourning over the fallen heroes vers III2 Then as part of the reparation due to the manes of the slain king David punishes the Amalekite for his selfconfessed crime vers 1316 and finally proTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW ceeds to pronounce on the heroes the dirge of lamentation which usually accompanied the dead to the grave cf 3 33 i Kings 13 30 c 78 The reason which has compelled the critics to mutilate our chapter is the contradiction between the account of Sauls death in I 31 and the report of the Amalekite The easiest way for our critics to overcome the difficulty is by resorting to their usual contrivance of postulating two different documents with redactional links and additions But the fact is as already noted by Qimhi and Ralbag that the Amalekites story in vers 6Io a is a pure fabrication The narrator does not indeed say so explicitly but there is no need for such an explicit state ment since the lie has just been given to the Amalekites story in the narrators own account in I 31 No one except perhaps a modern Bible critic whose constitutional scepticism is sometimes balanced by an astounding gulli bility would be taken in by the tissue of falsehoods which the brazenfaced Amalekite sought to palm off on David His lies stare one in the face First he did not as he says come to Gilboa by mere chance nrmnp wnp ver 6 He came there either as a combatant or as a thief to strip the dead and wounded Secondly he could not have managed to get right into the thick of the battlealso by mere chanceand penetrate through the chariots and horsemen so as to reach the wounded king Thirdly if the king had already been overtaken by the enemys cavalry he would not have had the time to engage the Amalekite in a conversation vers 79 Fourthly Saul would not have been deserted by all his own men and forced to solicit help from the Amalekite at least his armourbearer would have remained by his side as in fact he did I 31 45 It is evident that the 92STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 93 Amalekite was a member of some band of robbers who like vultures usually haunted the battlefields and preyed upon the dead and wounded He succeeded in discovering the body of the dead king before the Philistines I 31 8 stripped him and carried the royal insignia to David in expectation of a rich reward The narrator does not say that David really believed the details of the Amalekites story David accepted only the truth of the general state ment of the defeat of the Israelites which he must have expected himself and of the death of Saul as testified by the Amalekites possession of the regalia Perhaps he also believed it possible that the Amalekite had found Saul lying mortally wounded and had dispatched him of his own accord vers I4I6 79 Budde op cit 238 and other critics regard 4 o1 as contradictory to our account here since there David kills the Amalekite with his own hand whereas here ver I5 he has him killed by one of his men They think therefore that 4 o1 is based upon a different document and that originally some such account as in 4 Io followed here between ver 10 and ver 17 which however had been suppressed by the redactor in favour of the account in vers 6i6 But surely 4 10 is not a complete statement of the incident For even assuming that it is based on a different document that hypothetical document could not have said what 4 10 says that David slew the bearer of tidings for no other cause than that of having brought him the news of Sauls death Was death the usual reward for bringing the tidings of the death of a king  Or was David a bloodthirsty tyrant to slay innocent people for his mere pleasure  It is plain that the bearer of tidings must have been guilty of something more criminal than anything menTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tioned in 4 Io though not so criminal as the act of Rekab and Baanah If then 4 Io is incomplete and the real cause of Davids action was some unnamed crime committed by the man there is nothing to prevent us from assuming that 4 Io refers back to I 1516 and that the real cause of the mans death was as stated in our narrative here The critics have been misled by the literal interpretation of inmi in 4 Io But that expression need not mean that David slew the man with his own hand any more than for example n in 5 9 means that David built his fortress with his own hands cf above  65 Assuming therefore as we must that 4 10 points back to our passage here it is noteworthy that in the outburst of his passionate indignation David reports the words of the Amalekite as tw nn nrn and not w n 1n nrn This seems to confirm our view that David did not really believe the details of the Amalekites story in vers 6Ioa The insertion of the elegy in vers I927 was probably made by the author himself like the similar insertion of the elegy on Abner in 3 334 For a discussion of the original form of the elegy see the writers paper in this REVIEW vol V pp 2028 DAVID AND ISHBOSHETH 8o ch 2 The story of Davids accession to the throne first of Judah and then of all Israel contained in chs 25 5 must as a whole be assigned to the author of our book 2 2 refers back to I 25 423 2 4 f to I 3I III3 and 3 13 f to I i8 27 25 44 The author may however have used some older material particularly in his account of the fight at Gibeon It is also possible that the critics are right in regarding the chronological notes 94STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 95 in 2 Jo II as a later addition similar to I 13 I It has been argued by the critics that Ishbosheth must have been a minor when he succeeded to the throne of Israel since he did not accompany his father to Gilboa But we have no evidence that he was not present at Gilboa He might have escaped the slaughter of his brothers And if he did not go to the war it was perhaps due to his lack of physical courage rather than to his youthfulness His remonstrance with Abner in 3 7 would lead us to think that he had already reached manhood Note also his description as pi t in 4 I  Nevertheless he does not seem to have been as old as forty years on his accession 2 Io i e ten years older than David For in this case the difference in age between David and Jonathan the eldest son of Saul would have been rather too great to allow for such a warm and intimate friendship as existed between them 81 Budde op cit 240 regards 2 1416 as an inter polation He thinks that the story of the twentyfour champions was invented to explain the name of the field ver i6 b and that ver 17 originally followed immediately on ver 13 But it is difficult to see how the battle in ver 17 ff could have developed out of ver 13 b If the two rival hosts had deliberately come out to fight the narrator would have said in ver 3 b inr and not nI We want an explanation of the immediate cause of the outbreak of hostilities For it is apparent from vers 22 b 3 26 that Abner had entered on the fight unwillingly and unpreparedly And the ready consent of Joab to stop the fighting ver 27 proves that Joab too did not come out originally with the set purpose of fighting a battle It is evident therefore that the outbreak of the fighting was unexpected and against the wish of the generals and mustTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW therefore have been due to some chance incident such as that described in vers 14I6 which inflamed the passions both of the men and of their leaders It is however possible that there is a lacuna between ver I6 and ver 17 For we expect a statement that the fatal play had led to a quarrel and to mutual recriminations which resulted in a pitched battle between the rival hosts Perhaps the author derived his account from an older source which he abridged as he did for example in I Ic 7 if cf above  48 82 ch 3 Critics have denied the integrity of this chapter but on insufficient evidence They hold that vers 25 are a late redactional insertion removed here from behind 8 15 whither they also propose to transfer 5 I3I6 It is very magnanimous on their part to credit the ancient Hebrew writer with so much of their own Germanic sense of method and orderliness as to assert that he must have placed all these lists together but truth forces us to decline the flattering compliment For it is hard to see why a redactor should have transferred these lists from ch 8 to their present places The fact is that 3 25 is quite in its right place here and is the work of the author of the rest of the chapter who intended the list to illustrate the growing strength of David ver I b a Cf for example Esther 5 II a Dr H P Smith conjectures that two different documents have been joined together in the account of the negotiations between David and Abner One of the two accounts made Abner send to David by the hand of messengers the other made him come in person In the former document his motive was simply the convic tion that David was the man of the future The other gave the quarrel with Ishbaal as the occasion op cit 275 But it must be doubted whether any document would 96STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 97 have represented Abner as a selfish traitor ready to betray his weak protdgd Ishbosheth and the whole house of Saul for no cause whatever except his own personal advantage The change in Abners attitude to Ishbosheth must have been the result of some very powerful motive such as is supplied by our narrative in ver 7 ff Again is it likely that Abner would have been represented as coming per sonally to David after the long war which he had waged against him ver i without first obtaining through some trusted messengers a guarantee against violence to his person  Finally the fact that Abners visit to David took place during Joabs absence proves conclusively that this meeting between David and Abner had been fully arranged beforehand through ambassadors 83 Equally groundless is the theory of others that vers Izi6 are an interpolation It is impossible to believe that Abner would have begun his agitation among the elders in favour of David before he had concluded a secret agreement with David Why should David send to Ishbaal for Michal when as we learn from ver 13 the marriage was to confirm the secret alliance which Abner was seeking with David41 The answer is that Paltiel would not have given up his wife to whom he was so deeply attached ver 16 except at the bidding of his kingIshbosheth David insisted on the restoration of Michal as a pre liminary to the negotiations with Abner The only wayto secure her restoration without using forcible means was for David to make a formal demand to Ishbosheth ver I4 and for Abner to press his weak master to accede to the demand of his powerful rival The procedure must have been arranged secretly through the ambassadors 41 S A Cook AJSL ibid p 149 VOL VIII HTHE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW between David and Abner That Abner accompanied Michal as far as Bahurim ver I6 b is only what we would expect considering the rank of Michal and his own anxiety to secure the satisfaction of Davids demand Perhaps the arrival of Michal at Hebron coincided with the visit of Abner to David described in ver 20 If sovers I7I9 a would be anterior to ver I6 but this is not likely Further we need not be surprised that the narrator omitted to describe Michals arrival at Hebron For the whole Michal episode is given here not for its own sake but only as a sequel to I  8 27 19 II7 25 44 and as an introduction to II 6 I6 ff 84 The critics also declare ver 30 to be an interpolation without however giving a valid reason for this view The verse may very well be by the hand of our author and be intended as a summary of the narrative after the usual fashion of Biblical writers and also to explain that the murder was an act of blood revenge on behalf of the whole family For this reason Abishai is coupled with Joab in the act And though he did not actually assist in the murder yet he must have been privy to Joabs design That Joab did not act for himself alone but for the whole of his family is proved by the fact that Davids curse is called down not only upon the head of Joab but also upon the whole house of his father ver 29 a cf also ver 39 n1r iJx 85 ch 4 Critics have failed to understand the meaning of 4 23 and as usual in such a case have questioned the genuineness of these verses Rimmon as shown by his name which is that of the Syrian storm god was a Canaanite or more exactly a Hivvite When Saul destroyed the Gibeonites 21 i he must also have attacked their confederates the Beerothites cf Josh 9 17 c 98STUDIES IN THE BOOKS OF SAMUELSEGAL 99 Therefore the Beerothites with Rimmon among them fled to Gittaim where they lived as gerim retaining the name Beerothites In the course of time the sons of Rimmon became officers of Ishbosheth and ultimately murdered him no doubt as an act of blood revenge The writer describes them as Ip 3nn But as they were really Hivvites he adds in selfcorrection that they are reckoned to Benjamin not because they are Benjamites but only because Beeroth is reckoned a part of Benjamite territory ver 2 86 The critics hold ver 4 also to be an interpolation According to most of them it stood originally after 9 3 in the answer of Ziba to Davids inquiry But this is altogether improbable The answers of Ziba to the kings questions in 9 2 4 are fittingly very brief It is not likely that he would have launched forth into such a long state ment about Mephibosheth as that contained in 44 b without having been asked by the king to do so Again if our verse originally stood after 9 3 why was it transferred here to a place which according to the critics is much less appropriate for it  There can be no doubt that our verse was placed here by the author though he may have derived it from some old source For 4 14 is really introductory and preparatory to the narrative of the death of Ishbosheth and the accession of David to the throne of Saul 4 5 5 3 4 I describes the state of alarm and confusion which followed on Abners death and emboldened the Beerothites to commit their nefarious deed Vers 23 describe the murderers as introductory to vers 512 while ver 4 describes the helplessness of the sole remaining heir to Sauls throne Because of this helplessness he failed to take possession of the vacant throne and therefore the H X100 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW tribes of Israel were forced to turn to David and invite him to become their king42 This verse is therefore introductory to 5 13 and as such is an integral and necessary part of the authors

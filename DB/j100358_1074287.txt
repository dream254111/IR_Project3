J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074287,A NEW DEPARTURE IN THE STUDY OF MODERN LANGUAGES,I244504,A NEW DEPARTURE IN THE STUDY OF MODERN LANGUAGES AS THE MEANS OF EASY AND RAPID INTERCOMMUNICATION BETWEEN NATIONS MULTIPLY IT BECOMES MORE AND MORE IMPORTANT EVERY YEAR THAT GREATER ATTENTION SHOULD BE GIVEN TO THE STUDY OF FOREIGN MODERN LANGUAGES IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AT THE PRESENT TIME THE MOST IMPORTANT LANGUAGES FOR THIS PURPOSE ARE VERY EVIDENTLY FRENCH AND GERMAN FOR MANY YEARS TO COME THE STUDY OF SPANISH PORTUGUESE ITALIAN AND ALL OTHER FOREIGN MODERN LANGUAGES MUST OCCUPY A MUCH LESS IMPORTANT PLACE THAN THESE HOW THESE FOREIGN LANGUAGES CAN BEST BE TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IS A QUESTION WHICH HAS RECEIVED MUCH ATTENTION AT THE HANDS OF EXPERIENCED EDUCATORS OF THIS GENERA TION SOME HAVE CONTENDED THAT AS LITTLE OR NO OPPORTUNITY COULD BE OFFERED IN THIS COUNTRY FOR PRACTICAL COMMUNICATION IN THESE LANGUAGES AND AS THE TIME OF STUDENTS IN OUR SCHOOLS IS SO PRECIOUS AND THEIR PROGRAMMES ARE ALREADY OVERCROWDED THE ONLY THING TO BE ATTEMPTED SHOULD BE A TOLERABLE FAMILIARITY WITH THE PRINTED PAGES OF FOREIGN BOOKS OR JOURNALS WITHOUT ANY EXTENDED EFFORT TO WRITE OR SPEAK THE LANGUAGE IN QUESTION AFTER MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS A TEACHER THIS WAS A CONCLUSION PRACTICALLY REACHED BY THE WRITER A NUMBER OF YEARS SINCE AND MUCH OF HIS TEACHING IN YEARS PAST HAS DOUBTLESS BEEN VERY MATERIALLY INFLUENCED BY THIS CONCLUSION WITHIN THE PAST TWO YEARS HOWEVER A MODIFIED METHOD OF INSTRUCTION IN THIS DEPART MENT SEEMS LIKELY TO DO MUCH TO PLACE THE WRITING AND EVEN THE SPEAKING OF THESE FOREIGN LANGUAGES WITHIN COMPARATIVELY EASY REACH OF A VAST NUMBER OF OUR AMERICAN STUDENTS IT IS NOW ABOUT TWO YEARS SINCE M MIEILLE NOW A PROFESSOR IN THE LYCEE OF TARBES HAUTES PYRIENES WHILE IN ENGLAND DEVISED A METHOD OF INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENCE BETWEEN STUDENTS AND TEACHERS 257THHE SCHOOL REVIEW IN FRANCE AND ENGLAND WHICH HAS BEEN WARMLY RECEIVED BY EDUCATORS AND STUDENTS IN THOSE TWO COUNTRIES AND SEVERAL THOUSANDS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE CHANNEL ARE NOW ENTERED UPON THE LISTS AND MUTUALLY RENDERING EACH OTHER GREAT AID IN BECOMING FAMILIAR WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE LANGUAGES THE PROCESS IS VERY SIMPLE AND EMINENTLY PRACTICAL BEING CAPABLE OF APPLICATION TO STUDENTS OF ALL AGES AND GRADES AFTER THEY HAVE LEARNED TO READ AND WRITE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE AND HAVE MADE SOME PROGRESS IN ACQUIRING THE FOREIGN TONGUE PRO FESSOR MIEILLE THINKS THE SYSTEM APPLICABLE AS SOONAS THE STUDENT LEARNS TO WRITE VERY SIMPLE SENTENCES IN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE ON THIS POINT I AM NOT PREPARED TO SPEAK WITH GREAT CONFIDENCE BUT I SHOULD INCLINE TO GIVE STUDENTS ONE OR TWO YEARS WORK ON THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE IN AN ORDINARY SCHOOL COURSE BEFORE BEGIN NING THE CORRESPONDENCE I CONFESS THAT THEN IN EACH ADDED MONTH OF MY EXPERIENCE THUS FAR I HAVE BEEN INCLINED TO LOWER STEADILY THE GRADE OF WORK DEMANDED FOR A BEGINNING THEN TOO IT DEPENDS A GOOD DEAL UPON THE APTITUDE OF THE STUDENT SOME BEING QUITE CAPABLE OF DOING SATISFACTORY WORK AT A MUCH EARLIER STAGE OF THE COURSE THAN OTHERS BUT THIS IS A MINOR DETAIL FOR EACH TEACHER TO LEARN BY HIS OWN EXPERIENCE THE METHOD OF PROCEDURE MAY BE SIMPLY DESCRIBED THUS LET THOSE SCHOOLS COLLEGES OR INDIVIDUALS WHO WISH TO BEGIN THIS SYSTEM SEND THE NAMES AGES AND ADDRESSES OF THOSE WHO WISH TO CORRESPOND TO THE FOLLOWING WELLKNOWN FIRMS IN PARIS FOR YOUNG STUDENTS SEND TO MM ARMAND COLIN ET CIE NO 5 RUE DE MEZIERES PARIS AND FOR OLDER STUDENTS TEACHERS OR OTHER MATURE PERSONS ADDRESS LIBRAIRIE HACHETTE 79 BOULE VARD SAINT GERMAIN PARIS THESE FIRMS WILL GIVE PROMPT ATTENTION TO SUCH REQUESTS ASSIGNING TO EACH PERSON WHOSE NAME ETC IS SENT A SUITABLE CORRESPONDENT AND THESE FRENCH CORRESPONDENTS WRITE THE FIRST LETTER IN FRENCH TO THEIR AMERICAN FRIENDS WHO ON RECEIVING THE LETTERS PROMPTLY REPLY IN ENGLISH AFTER THESE FIRST LETTERS THE NEXT LETTER FROM FRANCE IS WRITTEN IN ENGLISH AND THE SECOND LETTER FROM AMERICA IS WRITTEN IN FRENCH THE CORRESPONDENCE 258THE STUDY OF MIODERN LANGUAGES THUS COMMENCED IS CONTINUED AS BEGUN ALTERNATING THE TWO LANGUAGES ALSO ALL LETTERS RECEIVED WHICH ARE WRITTEN IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE RECEIVER ARE RETURNED CAREFULLY CORRECTED TO THE WRITER THUS IF LETTERS ARE FILED AT THE END OF THE YEAR EACH STUDENT HAS MODEL LETTERS IN THE FOREIGN TONGUE AND HIS OWN COR RECTED LETTERS FOR CAREFUL STUDY I HAVE SAID THAT THIS SYSTEM IS WORKING WELL BETWEEN FRANCE AND ENGLAND IT IS ALSO WORKING TO SOME EXTENT BETWEEN FRANCE AND GERMANY FRANCE AND ITALY AND ON THIS SIDE THE WATER SEVERAL SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN CANADA ARE THUS IN COM MUNICATION WITH FRANCE AND SO FAR AS KNOWN BUT TWO INSTITU TIONS IN THE UNITED STATES VANDERBILT UNIVERSITY NASHVILLE TENN AND SWARTHMORE COLLEGE SWARTHMORE PA IN THIS COLLEGE ABOUT THIRTY OF THE STUDENTS MOSTLY THOSE IN THEIR THIRD AND FOURTH YEAR A FEW IN THEIR SECOND YEAR ARE ENROLLED AS COR RESPONDENTS THE LETTERS AS RECEIVED ARE READ ALOUD IN CLASS SOMETIMES TRANSLATED SOMETIMES IN FRENCH AND ARE MADE MOST INTERESTING TOPICS FOR THE LESSON OF THE DAY NO ONE WHO HAS NOT TRIED THE SYSTEM CAN FULLY REALIZE THE NEW LIFE AND SPIRIT THAT ARE THUS INFUSED INTO A CLASS INSTEAD OF BEING A DRY AND DULL GRAMMATICAL LESSON WITH LITTLE DIRECT PRACTICAL BEARING UPON DAILY LIFE THE LANGUAGE IS SEEN AT ONCE TO HAVE A LIFE AND A MEANING BEFORE LITTLE EXPECTED BY THE STUDENT THE LETTERS ARE SO DIS TRIBUTED THAT ONE OR SOMETIMES TWO MAY BE READ AT THE OPENING OF A CLASS AND THE EAGER ATTENTION WHICH THEY RECEIVE ENSURES A DEEP IMPRESSION UPON THE MIND OF EVERY STUDENT EVEN THE LETTERS IN ENGLISH ARE READ ALOUD AND THE ERRORS COMMITTED ARE NOT ONLY A SOURCE OF AMUSEMENT BUT AID MUCH IN FIXING UPON THE MINDS OF THE STUDENTS THE IDIOMS OF THE FOREIGN TONGUE THE ACQUAINTANCES THUS MADE TOO IN FOREIGN LANDS WILL BE A SOURCE OF GREAT PLEASURE AND SATISFACTION WHEN THESE YOUNG PEOPLE COME TO CROSS THE SEA AS MANY OF THEM WILL BE SURE TO DO IN THESE DAYS OF SHORT OCEAN VOYAGES AND ENDLESS TRAVELING FACILITIES UNKNOWN TO A PAST GENERATION ANOTHER INCIDENTAL BUT VERY IMPORTANT RESULT WHICH SUCH CORRESPONDENCE WOULD SECURE ON BECOMING GENERAL WOULD BE A 259260 THE SCHOOL RETVIEW FAR BETTER UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN DIFFERENT NATIONS AND A CON SEQUENT DRAWING TOGETHER IN SPIRIT AND THUS WOULD BE PROMOTED IN A GREAT DEGREE THE EARLY APPROACH OF THE TIME WHEN WARS AND FIGHTING SHOULD BE NO MORE AND PEACE WOULD PREVAIL THROUGHOUT ALL THE WORLD AND AMONG ALL THE INHABITANTS THEREOF EDWARD H

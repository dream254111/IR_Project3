the Advancement of Science W E HENDERSON  22 MIS intended for publication and books etc intended for review should be sent to Professor J McKeen Cattell Garrison OnHudson N Y THE NEW YORK CONVOCATION THE meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the affili ated national scientific societies held in New York City during the last week of the year was the largest and most important gathering of scientific men hitherto held in this country or elsewhere The association met in twelve sections and there were fiftytwo separate societies in session not counting the four great engineering societies which held one gen eral meeting with the association It is difficult to estimate the attendance The regis traition of members of the association was in the neighborhood of 2100 but it is impos sible to state the percentage of members of the association who register or the per ientage of those in attendance at the meeting who are members of the association Casual observation seemed to indicate that about one in four or five attending the meetings wore the badge of the association and this would give an attendance of over 8000 but naturally very little weight can be laid on such an estimate In spite of the magnitude of the meet ing Columbia University and the other places in which sessions were held did not appear 18 I I  I      I   IN S VOL XLV No 1149 to be overcrowded the university and the other educational and scientific institutions of the city having grown in proportion to the increase of scientific men since the meet ing in New York ten years ago There was no delay in registration and no difficulty in obtaining rooms at the hotels or elsewhere There was a very great conflict in so far as there were nearly always a number of dif ferent meetings or other events which mem bers would have been glad to attend This conflict may make a greater impression than if the meetings were being held in fifty different places throughout the country but obviously the real interference is much less The plan of holding the greater convoca tion week meetings once in four years seems to have been justified by the event The meeting four years hence will be in Chicago that of eight years hence in Wash ington and in twelve years there will be a return to New York It may be that ulti mately two events in the same year the presidential election and the convocation of our scientific societies will be recognized as of comparable national importance It is hoped that at these greater convocation week meetings the societies devoted to the natural and exact sciences will meet with all national organizations concerned with science in its widest sense not only engi neering and medicine but also education economics history philology and indeed all the subjects falling within the curric ulum of the modern university subjects which can be advanced by research A meeting of such magnitude would have great advantages in bringing together men working in diverse directions but none the less having common objects and would serve the purpose of impressing on the gen eral public the magnitude and importance of the work accomplished in this country for scholarship and science The American Association of University Professors and the American Congress of Internal Medicine met this year for the first time in convocation week and there is no reason why all national societies should not do so when the meeting is in New York Chicago or Washington The arrangements for affiliation with the asso ciation are very simple and apparently to the advantage of all The affiliated society has the privilege of meeting with the asso ciation when it sees fit and of electing one or two members of the council of the asso ciation The association has no control of any kind over the affiliated society Even when the affiliated society does not meet at the same time and place as the associa tion it is desirable that there be held once a year a congress representing all the scientific societies and scientific interests of the country and it seems that the coun cil of the association can serve this purpose better than any other body The National Academy of Sciences a small selfperpetu ating body consisting of men elected for eminence in science at the average age of about fifty years may be of use as a roll of honor but it can scarcely be expected to be an efficient working body and it is not so well in accord with democratic con ditions as a body of delegates elected to represent the scientific societies and the scientific men of the country 2 SCIENCEJANUARY 5 1917 SCIENCE The executive legislative and judicial functions of government are recognized but it is scarcely yet appreciated that there should be a scientific or expert department coordinate with these As the courts theo retically interpret legislation and the exec utive carries it into effect so there is needed a body which will provide the impartial advice and scientific knowledge on which legislation should be based This need is being gradually recognized by the creation of scientific bureaus of the departments and the different government commissions Its adequate appreciation may however be hastened by the formation of a body repre senting the scientific interests of the coun try and competent to speak for them The various scientific events of the meet ing are in part recorded in the report of the general secretary printed in this issue of SCIENCE and in the programs that were published in advance They will also be somewhat fully represented by the various addresses and papers and by the proceed ings of the different societies and sections to be printed in SCIENCE A few of them however may be recorded here At the opening general session after the admir able address of the retiring president Dr W W Campbell director of the Lick Ob servatory there was a largely attended re ception given by the president and trustees of the museum and the honorary reception committee The two public lectures to the citizens of the city could hardly have been better from the point of view of subject matter or of lecturer Dr Simon Flexner director of the laboratories of the Rocke feller Institute lectured at Columbia Uni versity on Infantile Paralysis and the Public Health and Dr A A Noyes pro fessor of physical chemistry in the Massa chusetts Institute of Technology lectured at the American Museum of Natural His tory on Nitrogen and Preparedness In each case the lecture concerned a subject of vital public interest and was given by the man most competent to survey it There was held at the United Engineer ing Societies Building a meeting under the auspices of the four engineering societies which have their headquarters in New York to discuss the interrelations of engineering and pure science Dr Henry M Howe the distinguished metallurgist professor emeritus in Columbia University the chair man of the section presided and Dr Bion J Arnold the retiring vicepresident and pastpresident of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers gave his address which was followed by addresses by Mr Clemens Herschel president of the Amer ican Society of Civil Engineers and Dr Ira D Hollis president of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers The scientific session was followed by a recep tion The addresses given by the other retiring chairmen of the sectionsare noted in the report of the general secretary and may be looked for in SCIENCE Other addresses by the presidents of the societies and papers presented before them will also be printed here Of the latter it is only possible to mention several of the symposiums and generalinterest sessions These included Biology and National Existence before the American Society of Naturalists The 3N S VOL XLV No 1149 Structure of Matter before the sections of physics and chemistry The Relations of Chemistry to Botany before the section of botany The Adjustment of Science to Practise in Agriculture before the section of agriculture Cancer and its Control before the section of physiology and ex perimental medicine Highway Engineer ing before the section of engineering Reports of State Geologists before the sec tion of geology and geography the Metric Conference before the section of social and economic science and the celebration of the twentyfifth anniversary of the American Psychological Association There was held at Columbia University a scientific exhibit and conversazione ar ranged under the auspices of seventeen committees representing the principal sci ences This not only showed in an inter esting way some of the more recent scien tific developments but also served as an excellent place for people working in differ ent departments to meet There was also held at the Amqerican Museum of Natural History an exhibit of chemical prepared ness and one on the work of Pasteur In addition there were numerous exhibits ar ranged by the special societies There were many dinners and social events Tea was served daily by the Colum bia University Ladies Committee The smoker given by the New York Zoological Society in the Aquarium to visitors work ing in the natural sciences was especially attractive but every society and group had its smokers and dinners Among them may be specially mentioned the dinner in honor of Professor Edmund B Wilson of Colum bia University a former president of the association given by his students and col leagues The meeting of the Committee of One Hundred on Scientific Research in spite of the fact that it was held the day after Christmas was attended by about fifty members and was notable for important reports and discussions The report of the committee on industrial research was pre sented by Dr Raymond Bacon director of the Mellon Institute for Industrial Re search and the discussion was opened by Dr J J Carty chairman of a similar com mittee of the National Research Council and by Dr F K Richtmyer chairman of a similar committee of the American Phys ical Society Preliminary reports were made by eleven of the chairmen of the twelve subcommittees on the different sci ences all of whom were present Arrange ments were adopted for cooperation with the National Research Council The meeting was much better reported in the press than ever before It is true that on one day when from two to three hundred scientific papers were presented many of them of general interest if properly inter preted for the public there were selected for head lines one that referred to birth control and one that referred to the Rev Billy Sunday but for the first time ade quate attention was paid to the meeting which obtained a position on the front page and was suitably discussed in editorial ar ticles This circumstance is of course ac counted for by the increased interest now taken in science throughout the world and it is much to be hoped that for the welfare 4 SCIENCEJANUARY 5 1917 of the world this interest may be main tained A meeting such as this should have as one of its principal functions to impress on the general public the importance of scientific research for it is only from the people at large that new recruits for sci ence can be obtained and means provided for the support of research The council discussed business of impor tance Two general resolutions were adopted One advocated a greater use of the metric system of weights and measures in the United States so as to increase the usefulness of our publications and to aid our foreign relations with the many coun tries where these units are official and in use The other extended to the secre taries and bureau chiefs of the United States government the appreciation of the association of the fact that through their encouragement the important scientific work under their direction has been well represented at the meetings of the associa tion This representation has greatly promoted the influence and usefulness of the bureaus both by making their work more widely known and by the stimulus imparted to and gained from other workers in similar fields The association is so keenly interested in the work of the gov ernment bureaus that it ventures to ex press the hope that members of their staffs who are engaged in research be given all practicable encouragement to attend the meetings of the association and other na tional and international organizations de voted to the advancement of science Thanks to the Colburn bequest the re search funds of the Association have been greatly increased and now amount to about 110000 During the year careful invest ments have been made by a committee con sisting of the treasurer Dr R S Wood ward president of the Carnegie Institu tion Mr A S Frissell president of the Fifth Avenue Bank and Mr John Tat lock of New York City Some part of this fund is reserved for specific purposes but the balance of the income amounting to about 4000 was appropriated for al lotment for scientific research and a com mittee on grants of seven was appointed representing the principal sciences and groups of sciences This committee con sists of Professor E C Pickering chair man mathematics and astronomy Profes sor Henry Crew physics Professor E C Franklin chemistry Professor W B Cannon zoology and physiology Professor N L Britton botany and Professor J Mc Keen Cattell anthropology and psychol ogy leaving one vacancy to be filled by a geologist The committee plans to make a careful study of the conditions in order to determine how the money can be expended to best advantage Applications for grants will however be welcomed these can be made to the chairman of the committee or to the member in charge of the subject con cerned An appropriation was made for the work of the Pacific branch of the association amounting to the entire dues paid by the members within the division except that required to pay for the journals that the members receive The entrance fees col lected by the branch were also allotted to it There was recently established through SCIENCE 5N S VOL XLV No 1149 the initiative of Professor H L Fairchild a local branch at Rochester and it is hoped that other branches will be established wherever they will serve to unite and ad vance the scientific interests of a city or locality To such local branches a sum not to exceed fifty cents for each member of the branch was allowed together with the entrance fees secured through the efforts of the branch The council had pleasure in acknowledg ing gifts for the research fund of the asso ciation of 1000 from Mr E D Adams and of 500 from Mr Cleveland H Dodge In accordance with the provisions of the constitution Mr Adams was elected a pa tron of the association If a hundred or a thousand men of means in this country whose wealth is in large measure due to the efforts of scientific men made more effi cient by their national societies would be come patrons of the assoeation there would be provided a productive fund for research administered by scientific men themselves and the relations of science to industry would be promoted At the meeting about three hundred citizens of the city became members of the association and of these a considerable number became life members including Mr Henry C Frick Mr Stuy vesant Fish Mr Felix M Warburg Mr James W Ellsworth Mr Francis L Stet son andothers prominent in the profes sional and business life of the city The committee on policy was instructed to prepare a revision of the constitution with bylaws and to report to the council at its next stated meeting The committee on policy was instructed in this revision espe cially to redefine the duties of the perma nent secretary and of the general secretary An amendment to the constitution was in troduced which will be voted on next year making the term of office of the general sec retary five years and it is planned that the general secretary shall be active in the work of the organization of the association in its relation to the affiliated societies and the general scientific activity of the country Professor J McKeen Cattell was elected to this office to which no salary is attached During the present year in order to rec ognize the cooperation that exists between the American Association and the affiliated societies members of these societies who joined the association during the year were admitted without payment of the entrance fee The results were particularly gratify ing in demonstrating the cordial relations existing between the association and the na tional societies as about 5000 members of these societies took advantage of this offer and were elected to membership during the year We hope to publish later a statement showing the number of scientific men from each of the affiliated societies who joined the association for it is a remarkable ex hibit of the number of men in this country engaged in scientific work When the asso ciation met in New York City in 1900 there were about 1700 members when it met there in 1906 there were about 5000 mem bers there are now about 12000 members The entrance fee of 5 prevents some of the younger scientific men of limited means from joining the association but it seems necessary to retain it to provide an income in addition to the very small annual dues 6 SCIENCEJANUARY 5 1917 of 3 and also because it makes the mem bership more permanent members hesi tating to withdraw for a short time when such a fee must be paid to resume their membership The council however passed a resolution providing that those becoming members of the national affiliated societies might be elected to membership in the American Association without payment of the entrance fee if they join the association within one year of becoming a member of the affiliated society This offer should give assistance to the affiliated societies as well as the association and should serve to unite in the association almost without exception the younger scientific men of the country The nation should be proud of its scien tific men when it regards the three presi dents of the association the retiring presi dent the president of the meeting and the president elect Dr W W Campbell di rector of the Lick Observatory who has twice crossed the continent to attend the meetings and has devoted his invaluable time to the organization of the Pacific Di vision gave the address as retiring presi dent which in content and in form of pres entation set a model which any similar offi cer anywhere in the world will find it hard to meet This address will be printed in SCIENCE as soon as arrangements can be made for the illustrations Dr Charles R Van Hise president of the University of Wisconsin in the front rank of geologists in a country which leads in geology and equally a leader in university education and in movements for the public welfare made an admirable presiding officer both in the general sessions and at the meetings of the council Dr Theodore W Richards di rector of the Wolcott Gibbs Memorial Lab oratory Harvard University distinguished wherever chemical research is undertaken the only nativeborn American to whom a Nobel prize in science has been awarded was elected to preside at the meeting to be held next year at Pittsburgh and to give the address the following year in Boston

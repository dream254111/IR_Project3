irrigated ranch in southeastern New Mexico and while the study of the prairiedog problem had taken us there we saw many interesting things in the bird line in passing As the ranch combined alfalfa and stock outside the branding corrals stood mowing machine and baling press while the adobe houses of the Mexican laborers stood in the background Behind thehouse water barrel and wood pile a pile of grubbedup roots as big as a haystackspoke of the waterless and treeless character of the valley but leafy rows of cottonwoods growing along the irrigation ditches and the vivid green alfalfa fields gave richness to the immediate landscape From the piazza as we lookt out on the highroad the principal passersby were Mexicans Sometimes there would be a prairie schooner drawn by four burros on one of which rode a small barelegged Mexican shaded by the inevitable peaked hat energetically whipping up his burro train Sometimes there would be six burros three abrest and frequently the load would be of mesquite roots sur mounted by a Mexican When we first got to the ranch the stock was being branided in the corral and as we past on our way back and forth to the dog field the fire in the middle of the circle the men with long branding irons making sudden lunges at the terrified cattle as they circled around the ring the bellows of pain the headlong plunge of a maddened steer at his tormentors and the circle of Mexican onlookers percht safely on top of the high corral fence all made a sight that we were glad to leave behind for the peaceful green alfalfa fields The irrigation of the alfalfa was a novel and most interesting sight to me The irrigator was a tall spare Mexican with a picturesque high hat purple shirt and red sash carrying over his shoulder a long shovel When he had turned the water into a field he would take off his sash throw it over a fence post roll his trousers high on his brown legs and then wade about among the ditches like a plover letting the water out here banking it in there hurrying from place to place till he seemed to be everywhere at once When a sluice had to be opened or shut in a distant field he would catch up his sash noose it around the nose of a horse he kept near by and with the shovel over his shoulder go swinging off bareback with the grace of a centaur The water from the ditches strewed the fields with multitudes of minnows that162

that was all water white wings and a babel of bird notes one day would be dry bare and silent the next the procession having followed the man with the shovel I wanted to follow too for the sight of acres of water birds was always fascinating The delicate gray and white forms of the wheeling flocks against the background of blue sky made a rarely beau tiful sight and with the sky for a background and the water for a mirror the birds were always making charming pictures One of the rarest we saw was that of a delicate red sunset mirrored in a flooded field in which white water fowl were wading What a picture from the hart of the New Mexico desert country A flock of nearly fifty longbilled curlew was seen one day and at another time half a dozen of the large sicklebilled birds were found in a field surrounded by a restless evershifting throng of yellowlegs and other sandpipers The liquid quality of the waterbirds notes spoken of by Frank Bolles was especially striking here when from an adjoining field came the dry land notes of sparrows When a birdcatching falcon flew over one and all of the white wings rose in terror but a grasshoppercatching Swainson hawk might sit on a fencepost overlook ing their field or even fly down in it after his catch and they would barely recog nize his presence Marsh hawks were often seen beating low over the alfalfa making dives with sprawling wings as they spiedwas it a mouse or a cotton rat and once we saw one standing in the midst of a field apparently watching for grasshoppers his queer ruffencircled face looking strikingly owllike Wherever we went we found birds for the rich irrigated ranch attracted hordes of migrants among the land as well as water birds to feed on its insects weed seeds and small mamnials and they were a particularly interesting assembly after weeks in a desert range In one old weed field we came on a flock of perhaps two hundred lark buntings migrants of the plains with their fall suits of brown Whiteneckt ravens were common in small flocks apparently gathering in from the deserts after the nesting time Large mixt flocks of blackbirds cowbirds red wings and yellowheads were often found in the cottonwoods squawking gurgling and singing a regular marsh medley and one morning thousands of yellowheads came with a loud noise of wingsa long black cloudand stopt at the trees near the ranch house As they lit in masses a great clattering broke out each of the crowded throng apparently clamoring for standing room When they were settled the trees lookt as if laden down with black fruit We slipt out to get a closer look at them and found long crowded lines on the barbed wire fences and numbers on the ground in such close array they seemed in sore danger of treding on one anothers toes Near at hand their orange oval fronts and jet black plumage made them indeed a splendid sight and when they started up we ex claimed with admiration for their epaulets flasht out snow white on their black velvety coats As we went back and forth thru the lanes to the prairiedog town tame young shrikes would sit calmly on the fence posts and let us pass a cuckoo would some times fly swiftly out of a cottonwood hedge where it had been engaged in its favorit occupation investigating caterpillar nests flocks of redwings with glowing epaulets would circle around and disappear in a field of milo maize the shrill pipe of an oriole would be followed by a yellow flash from a cottonwood and a sweet blackbird chorus would come from a tree top Occasionally a mockingbird would be seen along the lanes but it was a striking fact that while the mockers aboundedSept 1910 AN IRRIGATED RANCH IN THE FALL MIGRATION 163 on the mesquite plains they were rarely seen in the inhabited valleys Perhaps they had learned better A field of sugar cane along our road attracted flocks of migrating claycolored sparrows who stared at us as they clung atilt of the cane stems or pickt up seeds without observing us Dainty little pileolated warblers with golden front and bright green back would dart out of their cover and flit past us into a most inappropriately commonplace cornfield In the prairiedog town on the ranch the small brown owls that lived in the old dog holes were always amusing The twentyacre field which held by actual count one thousand and nine prairiedog burrows had probably several families of the owls for altho we never saw many in any one field at the same time the ejected pellets were numerous around the deserted buriows Curiously enough these black bulletshaped pellets were made largely of the big green beetles which we found on the plum trees of the orchard At sight of us the prairiedogs would scud away to their mounds turning around inside and coming up to peek and bark at us over the edge again while the owls would watch us with big fixt eyes as we appeared and if we came too near rise lightly on their wings fly a few rods and with strait hanging legs drop to earth again Tho the prairiedogs were doing great damage to the alfalfa they were most interesting little animals They found us interesting too apparently as they would stand and bark at us just as long as they dared It was a pretty sight to see a mother dog looking over the craterlike rim of the hole with her yellow pup pies beside her If we approacht they would drop down the hole but if we went the other way they would sometimes scatter and go loping about the town Holes dug out by badgers told of the tragedies of a dog town Prairiedogs are pretty good prospectors and sometimes bring up pay dirt the mammalogist remarkt reminiscently one day and then went on to tell how in a coal country where the surface was light colored they had brought up coal till every heap was as black as ink As we were walking along the edge of the dog town at one time the loud screaming note of a willet called our attention to one of the big gray birds standing by an irrigation pond in the adjoining alfalfa field He jerkt his head back and forth as he watcht us and then took wing changing on the instant from an ordinary speckled gray bird to a black and white creature of striking pattern On the edge of the irrigated tract a roadrunner would sometimes be seen crossing the field his head and tail on a level his long legs carrying him as smoothly as if he had been on rollers One that was shot proved his good offises to ranchmen by the contents of his stomach for it held in addition to a garter snake and a long centiped remains of a caterpillar a cricket some beetles and a supply of big grasshoppers A marsh in what was known as Casseys draw had been so flooded by the rains that none of the small mammals which should have been there were to be found but a variety of swallows were weaving back and forth above it and we flusht two night herons from the cattails while a great blue heron rose and flew slowly away down the draw As we waded thru the high grass a sora rail buzzed into the air staying just long enough for us to note his plump little body and short bill before he ended his short parabola out of sight in the grass Another time we flusht a jack snipe from a weedgrown lane With an explosive zeei zee  zeei it whizzed off coming down in a spot of brown ground which it matcht so well that we had to walk up nearer before we could separate the long bill from the brown ball Game birds were very scarce except for a family of scaled quail which lived about the ranch and were evidently not lookt upon as game birds for their favorit perch was the brushwood pile in the back yard They seemed oddly out of place because they were acting the part of domestic fowl and because in this assembly of birds from wellwatered lands they really belonged to this desert region

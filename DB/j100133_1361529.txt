the year tho both will surely be run in our present vol ume The delay however will be beneficial in the long run for it will enable Mr Finley to further perfect the material on hand and also to gather additional data from outside sources It will be remembered that Mr Lee Cham bers of Santa Monica has for several years been accumulating information respecting the California condor A surprisingly large num ber of records have been authenticated and the literature of the subject thoroly overhauled Now that Mr Finley has so good a foundation Mr Chambers has very generously insisted upon turning all the results of his own work over to Finley to be incorporated with the lat ters Life History This will all appear in due time in THE CONDOR The California Academy of Sciences ex pedition to the Galapagos Archipelago which left San Francisco June 28 1905 returned safely to the home port the first of December last All members of the party were in good health tho glad to get home Mr R H Beck who headed the expedition considers the collections obtained by far the most exten sive and complete of any that have ever been taken from that group of islands These large quantities of material in almost every branch of natural history await the work of specialists before the actual scientific results become fully known The most important local record in our pres ent issue is the new one for the English spar row which has at last made its appearance in Los Angeles County The approach of this in vader along the railroad lines from the north has been slow but steady and its ultimate es tablishment here has been expected for years It will now be interesting to see how the native linnet fares in competition Yet it will prob ably be several years before the pestiferous in terloper begins to affect our native bird fauna Mr R C McGregor calls our attention to the following rich sample of popular ornithology taken from a no less substantial current period ical than the Century Magazine March 19o6 page 788 In the feathered world of the West there is an analogous case of the utilization of the cac tusplant for the protection of progeny Singu larly enough though in a dry country it is a wading bird one of the varieties of the curlew with a long bill and long slender legs which like the antelope uses the cactus as a home and defense for her nest and young She will carry sticks in her long bill and drop them in position as nearly as possible in the center of a cactuspatch while hovering over it When she has accumulated enough alighting on the heap she arranges her nest wherein she lays four beautiful turquoise colored eggs about as large as those of a domes tic hen and then comes and goes from her nest at will knowing that it cannot be molested McGregor asks Did you ever hear of such a stunt by a curlew Does any curlew lay beautiful turquoisecolored eggs  We would like to know too Mr W L Finley was recently appointed lecturer for the National Association of Audu bon Societies He lectured in Baltimore Chi cago Grand Rapids Cincinnati Indianapolis St Louis St Paul and other cities in the in terests of the Audubon work During the spring he will make a lecture tour thru Oregon and Washington for the National As sociation We are in receipt of a cordial letter from Dr DEvelyn the new president of the Cooper Or nithological Club He enters upon his new duties enthusiastically and we trust that a new era of activity will be inaugurated in the North ern Division of the Club where interest in birds has been rather feeble since the quake Dr DEvelyn hints of certain plans for the spread of the Clubs influence especially along the lines of bird protection and educational work The Fish Commission steamer Albatross re turned to San Francisco December II after a very successful scientific cruise along the North Pacific coast of Asia Dr C H Gilbert of Stanford University was in charge of the work and Professor J O Snyder was one member of the party Marine forms of life were the chief objects of interest and vast quantities of speci mens were properly preserved The fishes re ceived most attention and these will be worked30 THE CONDOR

DECENTRALIZATION S GALE LOWRIE University of Cincinnati Thirteen years ago the American Political Science Association directed its attention to the changing relation between our national government and the states One of the speakers dis cerned in the tendency toward aggrandizement of national power manifestations of the principle that sovereignity unpro vided for in extant forms seeks to embody itself in new forms The signal incompetence of the states in dealing with economic questions together with their mendicant attitude towards the national government was seen as the cause of the transfer to national authority of control over currency supply transporta tion rates and methods and the seeming disposition to transfer control over all corporations Other speakers called attention to the great increase of national power under the commerce clause and under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution and one in a most thoughtful paper openly challenged the federal system as established in this country asserting that it showed disadvantages of increasing magnitude in comparison with a unitary system and was out of harmony with the general environ ment of modern industrialism2 1 Henry Jones Ford The Influence of State Politics in Expanding Federal Power in Proceedings of the American Political Science Association V p 53 2 Stephen Leacock The Limitation of Federal Government Proceedings of the American Political Science Association V p 37 379380 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The few years which have passed since these views were ex pressed have witnessed a conspicuous change in our institutions and in no respect has this been so marked as in the increased scope allotted to our national government It matters not so much under what provisions of the Constitution these extensions have been made the fact is that there has been a constant and to the present time an everincreasing demand that the govern mental relations to business and commerce be established on a countrywide scale This together with a growing demand for funds from the national treasury has resulted in a more rapid change in the relation between the states and the central govern ment than has occurred during any other period of our history save that which immediately followed the Civil War A catalogue listing only the major avenues through which this movement has progressed would note national expansion in rail way control in the establishment of a national system of high ways in education in taxation in banking and in prohibiting the manufacture and sale of liquors not to mention the enormous extension of national authority and influence under the war powers of the central government The growth of what might be termed the national police power is seen in acts controlling the hours of labor of children and the use of white phosphorus in the manufacture of matches the use of safety devices on the railroads and shipment of unwholesome articles of food The issue now pending before the United States Supreme Court as to the power to fix intrastate rates is perhaps not less important than any case which has arisen under the commerce clause since John Marshalls momentous decision in Gibbons vs Ogden3 The increase of national influence through subsidies particu larly in education presents again an old question The states themselves pointed the way in this field and showed how a decen tralized system of administration might permit the central author ity to dominate by providing funds made available only by compliance with specified standards and conditions While national encouragement of education was evidenced in the early provisions for the sale and settlement of government lands and the 8 9 Wheaton 1CENTRALIZATION VERSUS DECENTRALIZATION 381 Morrill grants the element of central control was lacking until the recent grants for vocational training and other educational purposes introduced a practice which seems but on the thresh hold of a very great enlargement and marks a distinct break with those of the past That the necessities of modern warfare should demand a highly centralized administration of national scope was to be expected The railroads and telegraph systems were taken over by the government because of the collapse of the existing system of management The reinstitution of private operation in many financial industrial and commercial fields inevitably leaves a residue of government control which did not exist before The most startling increase in national power we have had since the adoption of the Constitutionsave only the power con ferred by the Fourteenth Amendmentcomes through the Eighteenth Amendment which permits the central government to undertake the difficult task of prohibition enforcement This is probably the most severe test of the efficiency of national administration we have seen in times of peace Somewhat out side of the field of regulation lie such measures as the currency reform and the banking acts and the tax statutes which strongly operate to place under national influence the industrial agencies of the country The strength of the movement to lodge greater power with the national government at the expense of the states is further evi denced by the amendments to the Constitution which have taken place in the period we are considering Our Constitution had been considered an example of the rigid type so much so that many observing the great difficulty of utilizing the amending method and recalling that the original document with the changes almost immediately incorporated had been altered only by the rather questionable procedure used in making the Civil War amendments believed it almost unamendable Yet each of the four changes since 1908 except possibly the last tends to weaken the relative position of the states in our governmental system and the last two show clearly the disposition to incorporate important changes by national rather than state reform382 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW While this centralizing movement seems at full tide it is pertinent to inquire how far it is likely to extend and whether if we are but on the eve of a still greater demand for national laws and administration it would not be the better plan frankly to analyze the need and seek by constitutional amendment to vest definite powers in the central government rather than continue to employ the cumbersome method of interpreting the commerce clause the power to levy war or other section to accomplish the same ends Governmental power should be as broad as the problems with which it must deal This principle is applicable whether state action is needed to regulate industry to apply checks on what might develop as abuses or to facilitate the legitimate activities of its citizens The territorial extent of industry is usually determined by the width of the area covered by competing agencies Industrial concerns desiring the same markets are likely to form agreements and probably combinations and employees groups are usually established upon a basis equally broad It is obviously not always practical to maintain govern mental institutions over so extensive an area Other factors need consideration such as differences in nationality habits and customs of the people The division of power between the American states and our national government applied these principles fairly well to conditions as they existed when the Constitution was drafted The central government was given charge of foreign relations and such domestic matters as under contemporary conditions of commerce and industry needed uni form treatment coining money fixing standards of weights and measures controlling naturalization establishing post offices and roads and maintaining the army and navy While the scope retained by the states was still large the governmental powers there reposed corresponded in most instances to the areas covered by the industrial activities of the time As Professor Leacock says In the days of Alexander Hamilton this allotment of jurisdiction corresponded with the natural facts of economic life Today it does not4  Leacock The Limitation of Federal Government in Proceedings of the American Political Science Association V p 44CENTRALIZATION VERSUS DECENTRALIZATION 383 The expansion of national power as these areas have widened although appearing very great when we compare the federal system of the fathers with that of our day has been far too slow to relieve our industrial life of a heavy burden As the points of contact between the government and business have increased in number and as the territory covered by single industrial and commercial managements has spread over state after state railway commissions industrial commissions public utility commissions insurance banking and health commissions all with broad regulating powers have sprung up and have applied rulings which have often disregarded the countrywide nature of the enterprises controlled State laws and constitutions of vary ing natures variously interpreted by different judicial tribunals have added greatly to this complexity while a state policy of taxation has almost invariably been designed to secure the most revenue without regard to the possible imposition of double burdens in connection with that of other states It is interesting to note that while we have observed with general complacency the enhancement of the responsibilities of the central government there are very definite movements to wards devolution in both France and Great Britian The prob lem of liberty in France says Professor Barthelemy is the prob lem of decentralization resuscitation of the communes and the strengthening of local life and patriotism5 while Sir Edward Grey said in the House of Commons that Englands choice lay between devolution or destruction The difficulties atten dant upon extensive centralization are easily observable in Great Britain France and the United States Professor Garner criticises the highly centralized French administrative system declaring it impossible for the ministers or the directors at Paris to give their personal attention to onetenth of the mass of petty matters that come up from the communes for their action it has in consequence come to pass that many matters of local concern are determined by chiefs of bureaus and clerks at Paris 6 J W Garner Administrative Reform in France in 13 American Political Science Review p 32 n 6 J A Murray Macdonald 114 Contemporary Review 134 137384 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW rather than by local authorities who are most interested and who are in a better position to determine them quickly and per haps more wisely7 Mr MacDonald observes with respect to Great Britain that Parliament has long suffered from an all but intolerable congestion of work and the attempt to relieve Parliament by allowing the executive to assume a larger share has greatly increased the functions of the latter and curtailed the deliberative functions of Parliament Consequently long before the war broke out with no special emergency to justify it hardly a week went by in which one or other of the great Departments of State did not issue edicts of its own in the form of Orders in Council or Pro visional Orders which changed existing laws and had all the force and effect of Acts of Parliament without any of the scrutiny and debate to which they ought to have been subjected in Parliament8 A not dissimilar tendency is discerned in our own country by Mr Hughes who gives warning of the danger of increased bureaucracy as the legislature more and more escapes responsi bility by delegating its powers This becomes a convenient method of compromise and legislative evasion and the exercise of power is virtually irresponsible As new needs have grown up new agencies have been created responsible only to an appointing power busy with other matters In consequence we are ruled not by the Executive and Congress but by a host of department chiefs to whose personal desires the rights of American citizens are practically subject9 That the machinery of national government has failed to cope adequately with the increased burden centralization has imposed upon it probably most observers will agree Whether the diffi culty lies in the amount of new work or in the unwieldy size of Congress and its lack of organization adequate to function with the executive departments or in the failure to reorganize the 7Garner loc cit p 19 8 Loc

work in accordance with modern necessities is at least open to argument The fact re mains that we have been approaching a danger limit in our tendency to place heavier burdens on Congress and the national executive departments The changing relationship between our political units has not been confined to that existing between the national government and the states Maladjustments have been too evident within the states While in most instances the difficulties have been political rather than constitutional nearly every commonwealth with a large urban community within its borders has met an increasing demand for municipal home rule And although relinquishment of power has been reluctant the cities have assumed in an ever increasing measure authority which for merly rested with the states It might seem in consequence that ground between the upper and nether millstones of the national government on the one side and the cities on the other the states were fast losing their importance This might be the case were it not for the fact that they too are gaining in power through the centralizing tendencies already noted especially in the fields of administration Their gain is chiefly at the expense of the nonurban political subdivisions In education public health utility regulation banking insurance control and in the making and enforcement of industrial regulations the state governments have been playing a r6le of everincreasing impor tance and have probably assumed far more power and responsi bility than they have lost to the national government It has frequently been asserted that had the states foreseen the growth of the powers of the national government under the Constitution that document would never have been ratified But if their vision of the true nature of the government they constituted was limited so too was their power to foresee the necessities which have successively called for these extensions of power It is quite evident that we shall see a continuance of the centralizing tendency to effect not only national but inter national regulation and encouragement of enterprises the activities of which reach so extensive a field Commerce and386 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW industry cannot be restricted by the boundaries of our states or even of our nation So state control must yield to national control and the latter in turn in many instances to international control That we are on the eve of an extensive development of international labor regulations is indicated by the institution of the international labor office under the League of Nations the culmination of years of effort fostered by the International Association for Labor Legislation to form an international labor code So far as our country is concerned international action further enhances the power of the national government at the expense of the states But that the states will cease to form important units in our political system one would scarcely predict Events in Great Britain and France indicate how easy it is to go too far in cen tralizing control of affairs essentially local It is quite probable that changes in national administration will result in centering in local districts many matters now controlled in Washington and in the process of devolution the states will play important roles Insofar as the movement toward national control repre sents but a desire to shift to others the cost of governmental services it is of doubtful value but as a tendency to establish governmental action on a basis as broad as the field of the activity it seems in line with sound political principles

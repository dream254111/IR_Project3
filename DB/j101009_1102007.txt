statute of limitations is satisfied if the declaration was filed before the action was barred Holton v The Western Union Telegraph Co 19 S E Rep 843 94 Georgia 435 An amendment within the power of the court to allow is not the beginning of a new action so as to subject the suit to the operation of the statute of limitations which was not a bar at the time of instituting the action Guild v Parker 43 N J L 14 Vroom 430 Where an additional count filed long after the commencement of the action is a mere restatement by wav of amendment to the cause of action set up in the original counts the additional count does not introduce a new cause of action and the statute of limita tions is not a good plea when the original action was begun in apt time Blanchard v Lake Shore  M S Ry Co 126 Ill

only is needed and a public service water company may condemn the water rights of an inferior riparian proprietor by condemning the right to divert water without condemning the land over which it flows 2 SameA public service water company sought to condemn the water rights of an inferior riparian owner without invading the land of the latter and only desired to divert the water of a stream flow ing through his land The riparian owner owned the estate in fee simple and his riparian rights were appurtenant to and coextensive with the estate Held that the company must participate in the water of the stream on the basis that the riparian owners rights in the water were appurtenant to his estate and must expropriate the perpetual easement of the owner therein Appeal from Circuit Court Wise County Proceedings by the Clear Creek Water Company Incorporated to condemn a water right of the Gladeville Improvement Com pany From a judgment sustaining a demurrer to the petition and dismissing the proceeding the petitioner appeals Reversed Bullitt  Kclly and Jno W Chalkey for appellant Vicars  Peery for appellee WHITTLE J The plaintiff in error the Clear Creek Water Company Incorporated a public service corporation having au thority to condemn lands water water rights or any other prop erty and any estate or interest therein for its uses and purposes filed its petition in the circuit court of Wise county against the defendant in error the Gladeville Improvement Company an inferior riparian proprietor under chapter 46b Va Code 1904 for the purpose of condemning certain riparian rights of the defendant in error in Clear creek by intercepting and diverting all the waters in said creek and the two main forks thereof or as much as would flow through a 12inch pipe into and through the plaintiff in errors pipe line at the point of its proposed intake dams and reservoir above the lands of the defendant in error to supply the inhabitants of the town of Nortonwith water for domestic pur poses There was a demurrer to the petition and the circuit court be ing of opinion that the law does not authoize a water company to condemn a water right only but that it must if it condemns at all condemn the whole interest owned by the defendant that is the land itself sustained the demurrer and dismissed the petition That this ruling is a correct exposition of the law as it was un der the Codes of 1873 chapter 56  11 and 1887 chapter 46  1079 is admitted Indeed the provisions referred to which are identical were so construed by this court in the cases of City of Roanoke v Berkowitz 80 Va 616 and City of Charlottesville v 706  Jan1908 CLtAR CREEK W CO V GLADEVILLE IMP CO Maury 96 Va 383 31 S E 520 In the latter case the court observes It may be true as counsel for the city earnestly con tend that it is a great hardship upon the city to be compelled to condemn and pay for property which it does not need in order to get what is necessary for its purposes This is an argument more properly addressed to the Legislature than the courts It is suggested that these decisions accentuated the necessity for a more liberal policy and induced the Legislature to revise the law and adopt the rule which at present obtains However that may be the statutes now in force manifest a legislative purpose to confer upon public service corporations the power to condemn interests in land other than the entire interest when a partial and not the entire interest is needed for the purposes of the corpora tion Thus Va Code 1904  1105c cl 2 f authorizes such cor porations in the manner and subject to the limitations provided by the general statutes    for the condemnation of land to condemn for their purposes sand earth gravel water or other material and sections 1105f 4 and 1105f 5 prescribe the procedure for condemning any land or other property or any in terest or estate therein This phraseology characterizes the various provisions of chapter 46b and differentiates them from the statutes construed in the cases cited Section 1079 of the Code of 1887 declares that upon the pay ment to the parties entitled thereto or into court of the sum as certained by the commissioners as a just compensation for the land taken and for damages to the residue of the tract the title to that part of the land for which compensation is allowed shall be absolutely vested in the company    in fee simple except in the case of a turnpike company when a sufficient right of way only for the purposes of said company shall be vested while the corresponding provision of the present statute section 1105f 9 as amended Acts 1906 p 452 c 257 is as follows Upon such payment either to the person entitled thereto or into court and confirmation of the report the title to the part of the land and to the other property for which compensation is allowed shall be absolutely vested in the company in fee simple except in the case of a turnpike company when a sufficient right of way only for the purpose of such company shall be used and except also the case of any other company when if the notice of the application to the court shall so specify or describe and the peti tion shall so pray the interest or estate as shall be so specified and prayed for shall be vested Nothing in this Act contained shall be construed as authorizing the condemnation of a less es tate in the property taken than is owned by the party against whom the proceeding is The italicized words constitute the lim itation imposed by the amendment in Acts 1906 p 452 c 257 70713 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Among other definitions Bouvier observes that estate sig nifies that quantity of interest which a person has from absolute ownership down to naked possession It is in this sense that the term is employed in the amended act of 1906 It denotes the quantity of interest of the owner in the subject sought to be con demned Prior thereto it might have been competent to carve an inferior estate e g an estate for life or years out of the fee simple and to have condemned the lesser estate leaving the re version in the owner The purpose of the amendment was to abolish a provision so obviously unjust to the owner and to re quire the condemnation of the entire estate in the property pro posed to be taken It will be noticed that the word interest does not occur in the amendment So far as the interest which may be condemned is concerned the statute is left intact The amendment deals only with the estate Authority to condemn interests in any land sand earth gravel water or other material is left unimpaired but the entire estate in such parts of these various subjects as is proposed to be taken whatever that estate may be must be con demned In this instance the plaintiff in errors water mains are to con nect with a reservoir above and will not invade the land of the inferior riparian owner The company needs to intercept and di vert the water of the stream for its purposes but has no occasion to use the bed of the creek and may not therefore be required to condemn the land over which the water flows But the defend ant in error owns an estate in fee simple in the lower premises and its riparian rights in the water are appurtenant to and co extensive with that estate The condemning company must there fore participate in the water of the stream on that basis and expropriate the perpetual easement of the defendant in error therein Interests in water as well as in land are subject to the law of eminent domain Hamor v Bar Harbor Water Co 78 Me 127 3 Atl 40 Such interests are indispensable to water companies and when the waters of a stream are diverted the inferior riparian proprietor is entitled to compensation for the use of the water of which he is deprived This principle is illustrated by numerous decisions The following have more or less pertinency to the case in judgment Cooper v Williams 5 Ohio 391 24 Am Dec 299 Gilzinger v Saugerties

758 Trenton Water Power Co v Raff 36 N J Law 335 Avery v Fox Fed Cas No 674 1 Abb U S 246 The remaining ground of demurrer based on the alleged in 708 JanHART V DARTER sufficiency of the plat which the statute requires shall accompany the petition is not sustained by the record and was properly over ruled Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the law on the demurrer to the petition is with the plaintiff in error and it must consequently be overruled and the case remanded for further proceedings Reversed Note This is the first time that section of the Code passed no doubt at the suggestion of the court in Charlottesville v Maury 96 Va 383 has been before the court for construction and Judge Whittle de cides that those enactments confer upon public service corporations the power to condemn interests in land other than the entire interest when a partial and not the entire interest is needed for the purposes of the corporation The courts construction of this statute will undoubt edly meet with the approval of all and furnish an excellent oppor tunity for the court to apply that well known rule in the construction of statutes that the primary object in the interpretation of statutes is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the lawmakers and for that purpose they may consider the old law the mischief and the remedy At the same time and to avoid the injustice that might result to the owner from a too narrow construction of the term estate used in the limitation they held that it required the con demnation of the entire estate in the property proposed to be taken and that it was not competent to carve an inferior estate e g an estate for life or years out of the fee simple and to have condemned the lesser estate leaving the reversion in the owner thus applying that fundamental principle in the construction of statutes that wherever a statute is capable of two constructions one of which would work manifest injustice and the other would work no injustice it is the duty of the court to adopt the latter as it can scarcely be pre sumed that an injustice was in the legislative intent HART et al v DARTER et al Sept 12 1907

Sir WTilliam Thom son ill which he calculated the distribution of a rapidly varying electric current in a conductor It is well known that an electric current which has reached a steady condition in a wire is uniformly cSistributed through its sec tion and the resistance of the wire varies inversely as the area But with rapidly 7arying currents the case is different and the dif ference rnay be understood from all analogy to liquid motion due to Mr Hear7iside In the first place Professor Poynting has shown that the electrical energy which appears in a wire carrying a cur rent is not conveyed directly through the wire from the dynamo or battery supplying it but it is first conveyed to the medium sur rounding the circuit and then enters the wire at every point from the medium According to Mr Heaviside the state of tlle case may be partially represented by a hollow tube in a tank of watel If we move the tube slowly in one direction and if the tube be long in proportion to its diameter then in a short time all of the particles of water in the tube will be moving with it at the same velocity This represents a steady current and it partly illustrates Professor Poyntings idea for the motion of the water is due to the friction of the tube at every point of the boundary not to a pressure along the tube such as would be produced by a piston in it If instead of giving a steady motion in one direction we move the tube backward and forward rapidly we will have the outer layer of water moving nearly as fast as the tube the velocity decreasing as we proceed inward and finally if we make the oscillations short enough and rapid enough the inner layers will not move at all only the particles near the outside taking part in the motion Now this is exactly what happens in the case of an electric cur rent which changes very rapidly If the change is rapid enough the current corresponding to the velocity of the particles of waterwill be mainly near the outer surface of the wire ancl it rnight happen that there is no current at all at the axis The effect of this is to increase the apparent resistance of the conductor caus ing a greater loss from heating and a greater fall of potential than ordinary calculation would give Now although these facts have been pretty well known since Maxwells treatise on electricity and magnetism was published yet very few people suspected that they would have any practical bear ing on alternating systems of electrical distribution Sir William Thomson however in calculating out some numerical examples cbtains results which show that in the alternating system as ordi narily used a considerable portion of the inside of the conductors cloes not carry any current at all and is useless For example with the period of alternation used by the Westinghouse Company in the United States in the neighborhood of eight thousand a min ute the current does not penetrate so much as oneeighth of an inch into the wire The size of conductor used for distributing current for even a moderate number of lampssay a thousand lamps at a mean distance of a mileis much beyond this limit of semidiameter in the case cited being more than half an inch in diam eter The result is a much greater loss by heating than is usually calculated and a fall of potential that in some cases interferes with the brightness of the lamps In order to make these effects a min imum it would be necessary to use for conductors either thin hol low tubes or thin flat strips of metal and especially is this the case when a large number of lamps are to be supplied The ex pense of the tubes would in all probability make their use imprac ticable so that in future we may expect to see any extended alter natingcurrent distribution either with copper strips as conductors or with a number of comparatively small wires It should be pointed out as an illustration of the vaue of a sound mathetnatical training in applied electricity that the best form of conductor for any particular case of distribution whether strips a single wire or a number of wires can be calculated from obtainable data as to prices It is the experience of the writer however that few electric plants are installed in a way to secure the greatest economy and much money is wasted needlessly frona neglecting to make the necessary calculations THE SUN LAMP One of the most attractive of highpower electric lamps is that known in France where it was invented as the Zawnlfe soZezZ It consists of a wedge of some refractory ma terial marble preferably held between two carbon rods that are inclined to one another This is set in a cavity in a marble block held in an iron frame A very simple lamp of this kind can be made by boring a couple of holes in a block of marble so they are slightly inclined and approach within about a quarter of an inch at the bottom and putting in two carbon rods If this be supplied with an alternating current to form an arc between the carbons the marble will be heated and will give off a brilliant mellow light of a golden tinge very different from the piercing but rather disa greeable light of the orlinary arclamp A very high candlepower can be obtained from it and it is absolutely steady The objec tiOllS to its use arose from the facts that it was not certain to start up automatically when the current was turned on and it required alternating currents instead of direct This was some years ago before alternating currents had been largely introduced From the fact that a larger surface has to be heated than in the ordinary arc lamp and the surrounding material conducts away a considerable amount of heat the lamp is not so economical as are arclamps In the last few years alternatingcurrent distribution has been de veloped and now an English syndicate is being formed to intro duce a modified sunlamp in which many of the objections of the old form have been removed The lighting is now automatic and certain and the lamp can be used either with continuous or alter nating current generators For lighting halls galleries etc and in general for interior illumination this modified lamp should have an extensive field THE ELECTRIC LIGHT VS GAS IN FRANCE Messrs Brun  Co ownersof a sikrnanufactory at Et Clamond give some par ticulars in AXnnZes TeEgrapAzves as to the comparative cost of gas and electric lights obtained from two years experience in their works The original lighting of the factory was by 540 gasjets consuming 20000 francs worth of gas annually These were re placed by 600 illcandescent lampsonehalf

the factory works night and day and some of the lamps work 3600 hours a year while others are only used for 600 hours The following are the expenses Cost of gohorsepower engine with Sittings  32ooo

characteristics is not different from the contract of primarv insurance Certainly it has fared no better in the courts and the student of its career in the balls of justice and of legislation is strongly moved to echo the striking but exaggerated statemeint of Mr Johin A Finch before the American Bar Association The insurance company and its contracts have a place in the statutes and the courts unknown to any other company and to any other conitract the conipany has been the sport of legisla tures and its contracts the football of the courts  But while rein surance is of the same nature as insurance and subject to the same general rules of law there are yet some incidelits peculiar to reinsu rance that give rise to special rules of interest and importance The purpose of this paper is the aualysis of subch peculiar incidents aned the statement of the special rules of law applyinDg I THE CONTRACT IN GENERAL Reinsurance is a contract whereby one party for a valuable coL sideration assumes wlholly or in part a risk undertaken by the other under a policy of insurance upon some proper subject matter The subject of the reinsurance is the insurers risk the subject of the primary insurance is the property life or wellbeing of the insured In form however the policy of reinsurance generally insures to the original insurer the property or other valuable interest covered by the original policy B1ut the contract is none the less one of reinsurance though no reference be made to reinsurance and parol testimiony is admissible to show that a policy apparently of original insurance is really of reinsurance At the outstart there nmust be excluded from I Itep Am Bar Assn Vol 22 p 496 2 May on Ins sec 11 Arnould Marine Ins sec 324 3 Jackson v St Paul etc Ins Co 99 N Y

that name When a second policy is taken out upon the same interest for the benefit of the same person secured under a former outstanding policy such second policy is frequently termed reinsurance It is really however other insurance or double insurance To such contracts the following discussion has no application It must be noted also that the contracts generally regarded and treated as contracts of reinsurance fall into three separate classes which should be carefully distinguished in the formulation and appli cation of general rules A failure to observe this distinction has resulted in frequent erroneous decisions2 1 The contract of pure reinsurance arises when the reinsurer agrees to indemnify the insurer against loss suffered by reason of the risk assumed under the original policy by payment to the insurer 2 iReinsurance for the benefit of the original insured exists when the reinsurer contracts to indemnify the insurer by paying losses suffered to the insured in accordance with the terms of the original policy 3 Substitutionary reinsurance exists when the insurer transfers to the socalled reinsurer his entire business including both assets and liabilities under outstanding policies with the intention of retiring from business The policyholder is under no obligation to accept this substituted insurer in lieu of the one with whom he contracted but if he does a novation of the original contract results and the original insurer is discharged II VALIDITY OF THE CONTRACT 1 Public PolicyStatutesIn England reinsurance was long regarded as contrary to public policy as inducing speculation in premiums and promoting wagering insurance Accordingly all con tracts of reinsurance with a few excepted cases were prohibited by Act of Parliament in 1746 and this statutory bar was not removed until 1864 In this country however reinsurance has been recog nized as but an extension of the benevolent principle of insurance the distribution among many of a loss that might fall with crushing force upon one Hence the American courts have rather encouraged the making of reinsurance as tending to promote the solvency of I May on Ins sec 13 note 45 Am St Rep 442

671 insurers and the security of the public There can be no doubt that the original insurer may protect himself to the whole extent of his liability 2 Many of the States have by statute expressly authorized such contracts and some even require reinsurance iin specified cases3 It has been held that a contract to reinsure is invalid unless in writing on the ground that it is a promise to answer for the debt of another and therefore within the Statute of Frauds But such a view is altogether erroneous as the statute applies only when the promise is made to the creditor to answer for the debt of another whereas the reinsurer promises to indemnify the debtor by making payment to him It seems to be generally held that a corporation possessing general powers to make insurance may issue policies of reinsurance even though that power is not expressly given under its charter 6 especially when the charter is subject to a general insurance law that expressly authorizes reinsurance But the scope of a mutual benefit associa tion is more limited and it has been held that the assumption by one such association of the assets and membership obligations of another was ultra vires and void the power being not expressly given8 2 Insurable InterestThe insurer has such an insurable interest in the property covered by the original policy as will support a con tract of reinsurance to the full extent of the liability assumed9 But the contract of reinsurance just as that of primary insurance is one strictly of indemnity and the general rule is that a policy of rein surance is not valid unless based upon original insurance actually outstanding0 An apparent exception to this rule is found in policies of reinsurance to a specified amount covering risks under original policies issued and to be issued within certain periods of time These 13 Kent Com 278 Phcenix Ins Co v Transportation Co 117 U S 312 323 Sun Mut Ins Co v Ocean Ins Co 107 U S 485 Merry v Prince 2 Mass 176 2 Gray J in

the execution of the policy of insurance which are universally held to be valid They are not really exceptions to the general rule that an insurable interest must be in the insured both at the time of the inception of the policies and of the loss under it but anl adaptation of the rule to the uses of convenience under special conditions whereby in one case there is a substitution of equivalent interests and in the other a suspension of operation of the policy until the acquiisition of an interest to which a risk may attach It was in reference to such a  floating contract of reinsurance that Gummere J in a recent New Jersey case made the rather shocking statement that II   an insurable interest subsisting during the risk and at the tinme of loss is sufficient to support a policy of insurance against fire The de cision is correct but the statement quoted is far too broad III RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF REINSURER AND REINSURED Pure reinsurance is a personal contract of indemnity under whiclh no third persons can take any special rights It is frequently said that the relation betweeni reinsurer and insurer is that of principal and surety But manifestly this can be true only of those policies of reinsurance made for the benefit of the original insured and enforce able by him In cases of pure reinsurance there is no common creditor of both parties and therefore the peculiar rules arising out of the rela tion of principal and surety have no proper application to such con tracts The mutual rights of reinsurer and reinsured are of course largely determined by the conditions of each several policy which ought to be fairly construed in accordance with the intention of the parties but there are several underlyiing principles having their origin in the peculiar nature of the contract that should always be kept in mind in considering the rights of the parties 1 CostsThe contract of reinsurance is subject to all the condi tions of the original policy That is the reinsurer contracts to indemnify the reinsured against such loss as may be legally incurred 1 Lane v Maine Mutual Fire Ins Co 12 Me 44 28 Am Dec 150 Western etc Pipe Lines v Home Ins Co 145 Pa St 346 22 Atl 665

that the latter might have set up against the original insured When a loss occurs under the original policy it is the duty of the insurer to notify the reinsurer who may then elect to contest the liability or to make payment If the reinsurer elects to contest it is his duty to come in and defend the action brought against the insurer or in lieu thereof to reimburse the insurer for hiis costs expended including reasonable attorneys fees2 And it seems this should be equally the rule whether the insurers defense is successfuil or not though it is said by the court in Faneuil Hall Ins Co v Liverpool London  Globe Ins Go3 in deciding that the insurer could not recover from the reinsurer the costs of a success ful defense  Besides the plaintiff was successful and however far they may fall short in actual practice in theory the costs which the plaintiff recovered are supposed to be full indemnity for its trouble and expense In this case however the insurer had failed to give to the reinsurer notice of the impending contest and the statement above quoted is therefore dictum merely In case the insurer after the reinsurer has elected to contest a liability makes a settlement with the insured without the consent of the reinsurer the latter is wholly dis charged from liability4 If the reinsurer after notice given fails to elect it is still the duty of the insurer to defend if there is ground for contesting the liability and charge the reinsurer with the costs for as stated above the reinsurer may avail himself as against the insurer of any defense the latter might have set up under the original policy 2 Measure of Reinsuzrers LiabilityThe liability of the reinsurer to the insurer is measured by the latters liability under the original policy not by his payment made thereunder Therefore actual pay ment by the insurer to the insured is never a condition precedent to his right of recovery under the policy of reinsurance a fixed liability to pay is sufficient5 Therefore the insolvency of the insurer and his inability to discharge his obligations under the original policy do not I Joyce on Ins sec 138 2 New York State Marine Ins Co v Protection Ins Co 1

his suit upon a policy of reinsurance based upon such original policy While this is the general rule it must be remembered that reinsurance can properly go no further than indemnity A failure on the part of some courts to regard this latter principle has introduced some confusion into the decisions Many authorities2 state the rule broadly that the reinsurer must pay the total amount of the loss provided it does not exceed the stipulated amount of reinsurance without reference to the amount paid or to be paid by the insurer while some others have limited the insurers right of recovery against the reinsurer in case of actual previous payment to the amount of such payment3 The true rule is manifestly this The reinsurers contract is to indemnify the insurer against liability under the original policy The measure of indemnitypayment is then the insurers liability at the time of such payment Even though the insolvent insurer may be able to pay only a part of the sum due the original insured yet he is liable to account to his creditors for the whole of his claim against the reinsurer as part of the assets to which the creditors are entitled But when a settlement has been made whereby the total claim of the original insured has been discharged by the payment of a less sum than was due under the terms of the policy and all liability thereunder terminated it is manifest that the amount of the settle ment so made must limit the recovery from the reinsurer Thus where a liability for 6000 incurred under a risk which was reinsured for 2000 with a pro rata clause was settled by the original insurer by the payment of 600 it was properly held that the amount actually paid was the measure of the insurers loss and that only a prorated part of such sum could be required of the insurer4 But the mere fact that the insolvent insurer has actually paid to the insurer only a certain percentage of the whole amount due him and has been dis charged by such payment will afford the reinsurer no ground for refus ing to pay the whole amount of the reinsurance where the claim under the policy of reinsurance has been included in the assets from which the dividend was declared5 If however the insurers claim against I Joyce on Ins sec 133 Hone v Mutual Safety Ins Co 1 Sand 137 S C 2 N Y 235 But of course a pro rata clause in the reinsurance policy will be given full effect

Safety Ins Co 2 N Y 2351902 THE CONTRACT OF REINSURANCE 675 the reinsurer did not form a part of the fund from which a dividend had been already paid it would seem to follow on clear principle that the reinsurers contract to indemnify the insurer against loss on account of the risk under any policy would be fully performed by paying the sum actually paid to the policy holder there being no existing liability beyond that sum That the rule that the reinsurer is liable for the whole amount of the reinsurance even to an insolvent insurer is not opposed to the prin ciple of indemnity is well illustrated by In Re Cleveland Ins Co Here the Globe Insurance Company having become liable to the insol vent Cleveland Insurance Company upon certain policies of reinsurance to the full amount thereof was allowed to set off against these obliga tions such of the boughtup claims of the original insured as arose under policies covered by the reinsurance The Globe Company had contracted to indemnify the Cleveland Company against loss by reason of certain policies outstanding Hence the extinguishment by pur chase of claims arising under these policies though at much less than their nonminal value undoubtedly operated as a full indemnity to the insurer against loss by reason of them In the absence of express stipulation to the contrary the original insurer retains his authority under the conditions of the original policy and his consent given to acts thereunder or his waiver of conditions if not materially changing the contract will bind the reinsurer2 But if the insurer consents to a material increase of the risk the reinsurer is discharged3 V RIGHTS OF THE ORIGINAL INSURED A contract of pure reinsurance is personal to the parties thereto and the original insured can take no rights thereunder In the words of Emerigon5  The original contract subsists precisely as it was made without renewal or alteration The reinsurance is absolutely foreign to the first insured with whom the reinsurer contracts no sort of obli gation Nor has the original insured any claim whatever upon money paid by the reinsurer to the insurer by reason of loss under the 122 Fed 200 2

insolvents general assets and the policy holder has no valid claim for preference in regard to it above any other creditor This rule seems to be so well founded in reason and so well supported by authority that one is surprised to find any dissent from it Yet in a recent case decided in North Caro lina2 a very different doctrine strange and new in the law was laid down The Palatine Insurance Company reinsured certain outstand ing risks of the Merchants and Manufacturers Comipany with a further provision that all business written by the reinsured after a subsequent date specified should be for the benefit of the reinsurer and under his control it being the purpose of the reinsured gradually to retire from business for the benefit of the reinsurer The further provisions of the contract expressly limited its operation to the parties thereto and tlhough the Palatine Company agreed  to pay all such claims legally arising and duly proved it is manifest from the whole contract that such payment was to be made only to the Merchants Company and not to the policy holders Suit was brought against the reinsurer alone by the holder of a policy outstanding at the time of the making of the contract of reinsuraince The court after admitting that there was no promiise by the reinsurer to pay to the policy holder and that there is some diversity of opinlion in the decisions of the courts of our sister States and the general authorities decided that the defendants con tract of reinsurance was made for the benefit of the plaintiff and that the latter miiglht therefore prosecute his action as the real party in interest Such a conclusion is wholly unwarranted either by reasonl or authority The contract of reinsurance whereby the reinsurer agrees to pay losses to the original insurer is niot at all for the benefit of the original insured and he has no right legal or equitable in the money paid to the insurer as was stated above The court rests its decision upon Johann es v Phenix Ins Co which was plainly a case where the agreemenit of the reinsurer was to pay directly to the policy holders and therefore for the benefit of and properly enforceable by them The only case supporting the view taken by the North Carolina court is Hunt v NYew Hlampshire Fire Underwriters Association4 in 1 Goodrichs Appeal 109 Pa St 523 Glen v Hope Mut Ins Co 56 N Y 379 Barnes v Ilekla

REINSURANCE 677 which the New HampshiTe Court of Appeals reached an equally un sound conclusion Carpenter J states the case as follows The Peo ples insure As house for ten thousand dollars and immediately reinsure for the same amount with the defendants The house is burned and shortly after the Peoples become insolvent and as may be supposed unable to pay any part of their indebtedness The defendants willing to pelform their just obligations file a bill of interpleader against A and the Peoples and pay the ten thousand dollars into court To which party A who has lost that amoulnt or the Peoples who have lost nothirng does the money in equity belong The form of the qulestion is misleading It should be stated thllus Does the money paid under the contract of reinsurance properly belong to A alone or to A ratably with the other creditors of the Peoples There shiould be but one answer The sum due under the reinsurers promise to pay to the insurer is but an asset that should go to swell the fund from wihich the insolvents creditors are to receive a dividend and there is no reason why A should be preferred above his fellows But the court awarded the reinsurance money to A on the theory that the reinsurer and reinsured stood in the relation of principal and surety and applied the well accepted rule that the creditor mlay have the benefit of any provision made or security given by the principal debtor to indemnify the surety against the consequences of their joint liability thus allowilng A to avail himself of the reinsurance as though it were a provision made between the parties for the payment of As debt But it is the fundamental theory of pure reinsurance that it is a personal contract to pay a loss sustained by the insurer and it can be in no direct sense a provision for paying the debt incurred by the insurer to the policy holder Under the second class of reinsurance contracts in which the rein surer agrees to pay losses to the original insured the latters status is very different from that under contracts of the sort discussed above Here while the proinise is made to the insurer the payment is to be made to the insured who thus becomes a party in interest  In most of the United States the party for whose benefit a contract is made is allowed to enforce it This rule is reinforced by statutes in many of the States authorizing suit uipon a contract by the real party in in terest2 Under this rule the original insured to whom the reinsurer 1 Lawrence v Fox 20 N Y 268 Clark on Contracts 513 Othernvise in Massachu setts Exchange Bank v Rice 107 Mass 37 2 Cf Code Va sec 2415678 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Feb agrees to pay in accordance with the terms of the policy of reinsurance has concurrent remedies against both insurer and reinsurer He may sue either or both until his whole claim is satisfied While he has this double remedy he can have of course only a single satisfaction He cannot be required to elect between his remedies but may pursue both Therefore the fact that the plaintiff had filed his claim in pending bankruptcy proceedings against the reinsurer has been held to be no bar to his action for the whole amount of his claim against the insurer The assent by the insured to the provision made by the contract of reinsurance for the payment of losses under his policy will not amount to a novation of his original policy so as to discharge the original insurer 2 The right of the original insured in such case to demand the per formance of the reinsurers contract to pay to him any loss arising under the policy is in the nature of a vested right that will not be affected by defences available between the parties but not connected with the insured Thus in Glen v Hope Mutual Life Insurance Company the Craftsmens Life Assurance Company bad issued its policies to the amount of 15000 for the benefit of the plaintiffs and obtained pure reinsurance of the risk for 10000 Subsequently it reinsured all its outstanding policies with the defendant which agreed to assume all such policies and to pay the holders thereof all such sums as the original insurer might become liable to pay by reason of suc4 policies Upon the death of the insured the Craftsmens Comn pany collected the 10000 from the other reinsurers and the plaintiffs instituted suit against the defendant reinsurer for the whole sum due under the original policies The defeudant contended that it was liable to pay only 5 000 as its contract was to indemnify the original insurer But the court held that it had promised to pay to the plaintiffs such sums as the Craftsmens Company should become liable to pay and whatever might be the rights of the defendant against the Craftsmens Company the defendant was obliged to pay to the plaintiffs the entire sum of 15000 In aniother action upon the same contract of reinsurance it was held that the reinsurer was liable to pay damages suffered by the plaintiff through the failure of the I See Barnes v Hekla

RAILWAY 679 Craftsmens Company to accept premiums and keep alive the policy issued to the plaintiff Such a breach of contraet entailed a liability upon the insurer for which the reinsurer had contracted to answer to the plaintiff In a suit by the original insured under the policy of reinsurance it necessarily follows from the relation of the parties that the reinsurer may set up any defenses that the insurer might have availed himself of under the original policy as well as any defense which inheres in and affects the validity of the policy of reinsurance But of course a representation by the insured that was true at the time of the issue of the original policy will not avoid a policy of reinsurance issued at a time when such statement no longer correctly represented the facts Lastly it sometimes happens that one insurer buys out the business of a retiring insurer assumes its assets and obligations and discharges the latters outstanding policies by issuing to the holders thereof its own policies2 In such cases the policyholders of the retiring insurer may decline to accept such a substitution and may retain their rights against both insurer and reinsurer but if the substituted policy is accepted the transaction amounts to a novation and the original insurer is discharged W IR VANCE Washington  Lee Untiversity 1See Cohen v Continental Life Ins Co 69 N Y

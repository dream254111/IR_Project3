J101009,THE VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER,1101430,THE CONTRACT OF REINSURANCE,I245892,VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER VOL VII FEBRUARY 1902 NO 10 THE CONTRACT OF REINSURANCE THE CONTRACT OF REINSURANCE IN ITS ESSENTIAL CHARACTERISTICS IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM THE CONTRACT OF PRIMARV INSURANCE CERTAINLY IT HAS FARED NO BETTER IN THE COURTS AND THE STUDENT OF ITS CAREER IN THE BALLS OF JUSTICE AND OF LEGISLATION IS STRONGLY MOVED TO ECHO THE STRIKING BUT EXAGGERATED STATEMEINT OF MR JOHIN A FINCH BEFORE THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION THE INSURANCE COMPANY AND ITS CONTRACTS HAVE A PLACE IN THE STATUTES AND THE COURTS UNKNOWN TO ANY OTHER COMPANY AND TO ANY OTHER CONITRACT THE CONIPANY HAS BEEN THE SPORT OF LEGISLA TURES AND ITS CONTRACTS THE FOOTBALL OF THE COURTS  BUT WHILE REIN SURANCE IS OF THE SAME NATURE AS INSURANCE AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME GENERAL RULES OF LAW THERE ARE YET SOME INCIDELITS PECULIAR TO REINSU RANCE THAT GIVE RISE TO SPECIAL RULES OF INTEREST AND IMPORTANCE THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS THE AUALYSIS OF SUBCH PECULIAR INCIDENTS ANED THE STATEMENT OF THE SPECIAL RULES OF LAW APPLYINDG I THE CONTRACT IN GENERAL REINSURANCE IS A CONTRACT WHEREBY ONE PARTY FOR A VALUABLE COL SIDERATION ASSUMES WLHOLLY OR IN PART A RISK UNDERTAKEN BY THE OTHER UNDER A POLICY OF INSURANCE UPON SOME PROPER SUBJECT MATTER THE SUBJECT OF THE REINSURANCE IS THE INSURERS RISK THE SUBJECT OF THE PRIMARY INSURANCE IS THE PROPERTY LIFE OR WELLBEING OF THE INSURED IN FORM HOWEVER THE POLICY OF REINSURANCE GENERALLY INSURES TO THE ORIGINAL INSURER THE PROPERTY OR OTHER VALUABLE INTEREST COVERED BY THE ORIGINAL POLICY B1UT THE CONTRACT IS NONE THE LESS ONE OF REINSURANCE THOUGH NO REFERENCE BE MADE TO REINSURANCE AND PAROL TESTIMIONY IS ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW THAT A POLICY APPARENTLY OF ORIGINAL

IS REALLY HOWEVER OTHER INSURANCE OR DOUBLE INSURANCE TO SUCH CONTRACTS THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION HAS NO APPLICATION IT MUST BE NOTED ALSO THAT THE CONTRACTS GENERALLY REGARDED AND TREATED AS CONTRACTS OF REINSURANCE FALL INTO THREE SEPARATE CLASSES WHICH SHOULD BE CAREFULLY DISTINGUISHED IN THE FORMULATION AND APPLI CATION OF GENERAL RULES A FAILURE TO OBSERVE THIS DISTINCTION HAS RESULTED IN FREQUENT ERRONEOUS DECISIONS2 1 THE CONTRACT OF PURE REINSURANCE ARISES WHEN THE REINSURER AGREES TO INDEMNIFY THE INSURER AGAINST LOSS SUFFERED BY REASON OF THE RISK ASSUMED UNDER THE ORIGINAL POLICY BY PAYMENT TO THE INSURER 2 IREINSURANCE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ORIGINAL INSURED EXISTS WHEN THE REINSURER CONTRACTS TO INDEMNIFY THE INSURER BY PAYING LOSSES SUFFERED TO THE INSURED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ORIGINAL POLICY 3 SUBSTITUTIONARY REINSURANCE EXISTS WHEN THE INSURER TRANSFERS TO THE SOCALLED REINSURER HIS ENTIRE BUSINESS INCLUDING BOTH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES UNDER OUTSTANDING POLICIES WITH THE INTENTION OF RETIRING FROM BUSINESS THE POLICYHOLDER IS UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO ACCEPT THIS SUBSTITUTED INSURER IN LIEU OF THE ONE WITH WHOM HE CONTRACTED BUT IF HE DOES A NOVATION OF THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT RESULTS AND THE ORIGINAL INSURER IS DISCHARGED II VALIDITY OF THE CONTRACT 1 PUBLIC POLICYSTATUTESIN ENGLAND REINSURANCE WAS LONG REGARDED AS CONTRARY TO PUBLIC POLICY AS INDUCING SPECULATION IN PREMIUMS AND PROMOTING WAGERING INSURANCE ACCORDINGLY ALL CON TRACTS OF REINSURANCE WITH A FEW EXCEPTED CASES WERE PROHIBITED BY ACT OF PARLIAMENT IN 1746 AND THIS STATUTORY BAR WAS NOT REMOVED UNTIL 1864 IN THIS COUNTRY HOWEVER REINSURANCE HAS BEEN RECOG NIZED AS BUT AN EXTENSION OF THE BENEVOLENT PRINCIPLE OF INSURANCE THE DISTRIBUTION AMONG MANY OF A LOSS

AUTHORIZED SUCH CONTRACTS AND SOME EVEN REQUIRE REINSURANCE IIN SPECIFIED CASES3 IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT A CONTRACT TO REINSURE IS INVALID UNLESS IN WRITING ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS A PROMISE TO ANSWER FOR THE DEBT OF ANOTHER AND THEREFORE WITHIN THE STATUTE OF FRAUDS BUT SUCH A VIEW IS ALTOGETHER ERRONEOUS AS THE STATUTE APPLIES ONLY WHEN THE PROMISE IS MADE TO THE CREDITOR TO ANSWER FOR THE DEBT OF ANOTHER WHEREAS THE REINSURER PROMISES TO INDEMNIFY THE DEBTOR BY MAKING PAYMENT TO HIM IT SEEMS TO BE GENERALLY HELD THAT A CORPORATION POSSESSING GENERAL POWERS TO MAKE INSURANCE MAY ISSUE POLICIES OF REINSURANCE EVEN THOUGH THAT POWER IS NOT EXPRESSLY GIVEN UNDER ITS CHARTER 6 ESPECIALLY WHEN THE CHARTER IS SUBJECT TO A GENERAL INSURANCE LAW THAT EXPRESSLY AUTHORIZES REINSURANCE BUT THE SCOPE OF A MUTUAL BENEFIT ASSOCIA TION IS MORE LIMITED AND IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT THE ASSUMPTION BY ONE SUCH ASSOCIATION OF THE ASSETS AND MEMBERSHIP OBLIGATIONS OF ANOTHER WAS ULTRA VIRES AND VOID

FULL EXTENT OF THE LIABILITY ASSUMED9 BUT THE CONTRACT OF REINSURANCE JUST AS THAT OF PRIMARY INSURANCE IS ONE STRICTLY OF INDEMNITY AND THE GENERAL RULE IS THAT A POLICY OF REIN SURANCE IS NOT VALID UNLESS BASED UPON ORIGINAL INSURANCE ACTUALLY OUTSTANDING0 AN APPARENT EXCEPTION TO THIS RULE IS FOUND IN POLICIES OF REINSURANCE TO A SPECIFIED AMOUNT COVERING RISKS UNDER ORIGINAL POLICIES ISSUED

THOSE POLICIES OF REINSURANCE MADE FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE ORIGINAL INSURED AND ENFORCE ABLE BY HIM IN CASES OF PURE REINSURANCE THERE IS NO COMMON CREDITOR OF BOTH PARTIES AND THEREFORE THE PECULIAR

OF EACH SEVERAL POLICY WHICH OUGHT TO BE FAIRLY CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE INTENTION OF THE PARTIES BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL UNDERLYIING PRINCIPLES HAVING THEIR ORIGIN IN THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE

THAT THE LATTER MIGHT HAVE SET UP AGAINST THE ORIGINAL INSURED WHEN A LOSS OCCURS UNDER THE ORIGINAL POLICY IT IS THE DUTY OF THE INSURER TO NOTIFY THE REINSURER WHO MAY THEN ELECT TO CONTEST THE LIABILITY OR TO MAKE PAYMENT IF THE REINSURER ELECTS TO CONTEST IT IS HIS DUTY TO COME IN AND DEFEND THE ACTION BROUGHT AGAINST THE INSURER OR IN LIEU THEREOF TO REIMBURSE THE INSURER FOR HIIS COSTS EXPENDED INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES2 AND IT SEEMS THIS SHOULD BE EQUALLY THE RULE WHETHER THE INSURERS DEFENSE IS SUCCESSFUIL OR NOT THOUGH IT IS SAID BY THE COURT IN FANEUIL HALL INS CO V LIVERPOOL LONDON  GLOBE INS GO3 IN DECIDING THAT THE INSURER COULD NOT RECOVER FROM THE REINSURER THE COSTS OF A SUCCESS FUL DEFENSE  BESIDES THE PLAINTIFF WAS SUCCESSFUL AND HOWEVER FAR THEY MAY FALL SHORT IN ACTUAL PRACTICE IN THEORY THE COSTS WHICH THE PLAINTIFF RECOVERED ARE SUPPOSED TO BE FULL INDEMNITY FOR ITS TROUBLE AND EXPENSE IN THIS CASE HOWEVER THE INSURER HAD FAILED TO GIVE TO THE REINSURER NOTICE OF THE IMPENDING CONTEST AND THE STATEMENT ABOVE QUOTED IS THEREFORE DICTUM MERELY IN CASE THE INSURER AFTER THE REINSURER HAS ELECTED TO CONTEST A LIABILITY MAKES A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INSURED WITHOUT THE CONSENT OF THE REINSURER THE LATTER IS WHOLLY DIS CHARGED FROM LIABILITY4 IF THE REINSURER AFTER NOTICE GIVEN FAILS TO ELECT IT IS STILL THE DUTY OF THE INSURER TO DEFEND IF

PART OF SOME COURTS TO REGARD THIS LATTER PRINCIPLE HAS INTRODUCED SOME CONFUSION INTO THE DECISIONS MANY AUTHORITIES2 STATE THE RULE BROADLY THAT THE REINSURER MUST PAY THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF THE LOSS PROVIDED IT DOES NOT EXCEED THE STIPULATED AMOUNT OF REINSURANCE WITHOUT REFERENCE TO THE AMOUNT PAID OR TO BE PAID BY THE INSURER WHILE SOME OTHERS HAVE LIMITED THE INSURERS RIGHT OF RECOVERY AGAINST THE REINSURER IN CASE OF ACTUAL PREVIOUS PAYMENT TO THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PAYMENT3 THE TRUE RULE IS MANIFESTLY THIS THE REINSURERS CONTRACT IS TO INDEMNIFY THE INSURER AGAINST LIABILITY UNDER THE ORIGINAL POLICY THE MEASURE OF INDEMNITYPAYMENT IS THEN THE INSURERS LIABILITY AT THE TIME OF SUCH PAYMENT EVEN THOUGH THE INSOLVENT INSURER MAY BE ABLE TO PAY ONLY A PART OF THE SUM DUE THE ORIGINAL INSURED YET HE IS LIABLE TO ACCOUNT TO HIS CREDITORS FOR THE WHOLE OF HIS CLAIM AGAINST THE REINSURER AS PART OF THE ASSETS TO WHICH THE CREDITORS ARE ENTITLED BUT WHEN A SETTLEMENT HAS BEEN MADE WHEREBY THE TOTAL CLAIM OF THE ORIGINAL INSURED HAS BEEN DISCHARGED BY THE PAYMENT OF A LESS SUM THAN WAS DUE UNDER THE TERMS OF THE POLICY AND ALL LIABILITY THEREUNDER TERMINATED IT IS MANIFEST THAT THE AMOUNT OF THE SETTLE MENT SO MADE MUST LIMIT THE RECOVERY FROM THE REINSURER THUS WHERE A LIABILITY FOR 6000 INCURRED UNDER A RISK WHICH WAS REINSURED FOR 2000 WITH A PRO RATA CLAUSE WAS SETTLED BY THE ORIGINAL INSURER BY THE PAYMENT OF 600 IT WAS PROPERLY HELD THAT THE AMOUNT ACTUALLY PAID WAS THE MEASURE OF THE INSURERS LOSS AND THAT ONLY A PRORATED PART OF SUCH SUM COULD BE REQUIRED OF THE INSURER4 BUT THE MERE FACT THAT THE INSOLVENT INSURER HAS ACTUALLY PAID TO THE INSURER ONLY A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLE AMOUNT DUE HIM AND HAS BEEN DIS CHARGED BY SUCH PAYMENT WILL AFFORD THE

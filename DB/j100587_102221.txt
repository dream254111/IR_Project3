HALLY SIR I HERE SEND YOU AN ASTRONOMICAL ACCOUNT OF THE MOST REMOTE OF ALL THE PLANETS OF OUR VORTEX AND WITHAL OF THE MOST INCONSIDERABLE I MEAN OF THE SATELLITE OF SATURN DISCOVERED IN THE YEAR 1655 BY MONSIEUR CHRISTIAN HUGENS OF ZULICHEM WHO IN THAT ACCURATE TREA TISE OF HIS SYSTEMA SATURNIUM FROM PAG 25 TO 34 GIVES US THE THEORY OF ITS MOTION AS WELL AS THE SHORTNESS OF THE INTERVAL OF TIME BETWEEN HIS OBSERVATIONS WOULD ADMIT AND SINCE HIM I KNOW NONE THAT HAVE GONE ABOUT TO IMPROVE THE SAID THEORY THE LATE CONJUNCTIONS OF JUPITER AND SATURN GIVING ME FREQUENT OCCASIONS OF VIEWING THEM BOTH WITH A TELESCOPE THAT I HAVE OF ABOUT 24FOOT AND PRETTY GOOD OF THAT LENGTH I EASILY REMARQUED THIS SA TALLITE OF SATURN AND HAVEING FOUND IT IN A CONVENIENT POSITION TO DE TERMINE ITS PLACE I PERCIEVED THAT HUGENSS NUMBERS WERE CONSI DERABLY RUN OUT AND ABOUT 15 DEGREES IN TWENTY YEARS TOO SWIFT THIS MADE ME RESOLVE MORE NICELY TO ENQUIRE INTO ITS PERIOD AND AC CORDINGLY I WAITED TILL I HAD GOTTEN A COMPETENT NUMBER OF OBSERVA TIONS THE MOST CONSIDERABLE WHEREOF ARE THESE 1682 NOVEMBER 13 13  00 PM THE SATELLITE APPEARED ON THE NORTH SIDE OF SATURN AND A PERPENDICULAR LET FALL FROM IT ON THE TRANS VERS DIAMETER OF THE RING FELL UPON THE MIDDLE OF THE DARK SPACE OF THE FOLLOWING ANSAE AND THE SAME NIGHT 19 00 IT HAD PAST THE CONJUNCTION AND THE PERPENDICULAR FELL EXACTLY ON THE WESTERN EDG OF THE GLOBE OF SATURN AS IN TAB 2 FIGURE 8 THE NORTHERN LATI TUDE AND RETROGRADE MOTION MADE IT EVIDENT THAT THE SATELLITE WAS THEN IN PERIGAEO AGAIN83 AGAIN NOVEMBER 21 16 15 THIS SATELLITE OF SATURN WAS ON HIS SOUTH SIDE THE PERPENDICULAR ON THE LINE OF THE ANSAE FELL ON THE MIDDLE OF THE DARK SPACE OF THE WESTERN ANSAE AND THE SAME NIGHT 19 00 THE PERPENDICULAR FELL PRECISLY ON THE CENTER OF SATURN AND THE DISTANCE THEREFROM WAS SOMEWHAT LESS THAN ONE DIAMETER OF THE RING AS IN FIG 9 BY THIS IT WAS EVIDENT THAT THE SATELLITE WAS IN APOGAEO I OBSERVED IT IN APOGAEO AGAIN ON THE 24TH OF JANUARY 1683 AT 8 00 PM THE PERPENDICULAR ON THE LINE OF THE ANSAE FELL EXACTLY ON THE WESTERN LIMB OF THE GLOBE OF SATURN AND AT 9 30 PM THE SAID PER PENDICULAR FELL WITHIN THE GLOBE MORE THAN HALF WAY TO THE CENTER AND THE DISTANCE FROM THE LINE OF THE ANSAE TOWARDS THE SOUTH SEEMED MUCH ABOUT ONE DIAMETER OF THE RING FIG 10 LASTLY FEBRUARY 9 1683 8 10 PM IT WAS AGAIN IN APOGAEO AND I COULD BY NO MEANS DISCERN TOWARDS WHICH SIDE IT ENCLIND MOST NOR WHETHER THE TRANSVERSS DIAMETER OF THE RING OR THE DISTANCE OF THE SATELLITE THEREFROM WERE THE GREATER SO THAT AT THAT TIME IT WAS PRECISLY APOGAEON FIG 11 TO COMPARE WITH THESE I CHOSE TWO OUT OF THOSE OF MONSIEUR HU GENS WHICH SEEMED THE MOST TO BE CONFIDED IN THE FIRST MADE 1659 MARCH 14 ST N 12 00 AT THE HAGUE WHEN THE SATEL LITE APPEARED ABOUT ONE DIAMETER OF THE RING UNDER SATURN BUT IT WAS GONE SO FARR TO THE WESTWARD THAT HE CONCLUDED THAT ABOUT FOUR HOURS BEFORE OR 7 40 AT LONDON IT HAD BEEN IN PERIGAEO FIG 12 AGAIN MARCH 22 1659 10 45 THE SATELLITE WAS A WHOLE DIAMETER ABOVE THE LINE OF THE ANSAE AND THE PERPENDICULAR THEREON FELL NEARLY UPON THE EXTREMITY OF THE EASTERN ANSAE SEE FIG 6 I COULD WISH THAT WE HAD SOME INTERMEDIATE OBSERVATIONS BUT THERE ARE NONE EXTANT THAT I CAN HEAR OF SO I PROCEED TO THE SEARCH OF THIS SATELLITS PERIOD BY THE FIRST OF MY OBSERVATIONS IT APPEARS THAT THE SATELLITE WAS IN PERIGAEO 1682 NOVEMBER 13 17 00 CIRCITER AT WHICH TIME SA TURN WAS 3 21 39 FROM THE FIRST STAR OF ARIES IN THE ECLIPTICK BUT THE EARTH REDUCED TO SATURNS EQUINOCTIAL AND THE SATELLITE WAS 9 23 46 A 1   AND MARCH 4 1659 740 SATURNS PLACE IN THE ECLIPTICK WAS 6 0 41 BUT THE EARTH REDUCED AND CONSEQUENTLY84 CONSEQUENTLY THE SATTLLITE IN 11 28 18 A PRIMA STELLA ARIETIS THE INTERVAL OF TIME IS 8655 DAIES 9 HOURS 20 MINUTES IN WHICH THE SATELLITE HAD MADE A CERTAIN NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS TO THE SIXT STARS AND BESIDES 9 25 28 OR 295 DEGREES 28 MIN WHOSE COM PLEMENT TO A CIRCLE 64 32 IS 2 DAIES 20 36 MOTION OF THE SA TELLITE ACCORDING TO HUGENS SO THAT 8658 DAIES 5 56 OR 12467876 MINUTES OF TIME IS THE TIME OF SOME NUMBER OF INTIRE REVOLUTIONS AND DIVIDING THAT INTERVAL BY 15 DAIES 22 HOURS 39 MINUTES OR 22959 MIN THE PERIOD OF HUGENS THE QUOTIENT 543 SHEWES THE NUMBER OF REVOLUTIONS AND AGAIN DIVIDING 12467876 MIN BY 543 THE 22961 1 12MIN OR 15 DAIES 22 41 6 APPEARS TO BE THE TRUE TIME OF THIS SATELLITS PERIOD HENCE THE DIURNAL MOTION WILL BE 22 34 38 18 AND THE ANNUAL BESIDES 22 REVOLUTIONS 10 20 43 HAVING MADE TABLES TO THIS PERIOD I FOUND THAT IN THE APOGAEON OB SERVATION OF HUGENS THE SATELLITE WAS ABOVE 3 DEGREES FASTER THAN BY MY CALCULUS AND THAT IN THE THREE OTHER OBSERVATIONS OF MY OWN BE ING LIKEWISE IN THE SUPERIOR PART IT WAS ABOUT 2 12 DEGREES SLOWER THAN BY THE SAME CALCULATION NOW TIS EVIDENT THAT THESE DIFFERENCES MUST ARISE FROM SOME ECCENTRICITY IN THE ORBITE OF THIS SATELLITE AND THAT IN MARCH 1659 THE APOCRONION AS I MAY CALL IT WAS SOME WHERE IN THE ORIENTAL SEMICIRCLE AND THAT IN NOVEMBER 1682 IT WAS IN THE WESTERN SEMICIRCLE AND SUPPOSING THE APOCRONION FIXT IT MUST NECESSARILY BE BETWEEN 923 46AND 1128 18 A 1   THAT BE ING THE COMMON PART BETWEEN THOSE TWO SEMICIRCLES AND BECAUSE THE DIFFERENCE WAS GREATER IN HUGENS OBSERVATION THAN IN MINE TWILL FOLLOW THAT THE LINEA APSIDUM OR APOCRONION SHOULD BE NEAR ER TO 9 23 46 THAN TO 11 28 18 I WILL SUPPOSE 10 22 00 A PRIMA STELLA ARIETIS WHICH HAPPENS TO BE ALSO THE PLACE OF SATURN EQUINOX AND THE GREATEST AEQUATION ABOUT 2 14 DEGREES UPON THE SCORE OF THIS INEQUALITY THE MEAN MOTION OF THE SATELLITE WILL BE FOUND ABOUT 2 4S SLOWER IN 23 12 YEARS OR 7 MIN IN A YEAR WHENCE I STATE THE ANNUAL MOTION 10 20 36 ABOVE 22 REVOLUTIONS AND THE COT RECT EPOCHA FOR THE LAST DAY OF DECEMBER 1682

THAT AS THE APOGAEON OF OUR MOON HAS A MOTION ABOUT THE EARTH IN ABOUT 9 YEARS SO THAT F THIS SATELLITE OUGHT TO HAVE ABOUT SATURN BUT WITH A MUCH LONGER PERIOD WHICH FUTURE OBSERVATION MAY DISCOVER THE DISTANCE OF THIS SATELLITE FROM THE CENTER OF SATURN SEEMS TO BE MUCH ABOUT 4 DIAMITERS OF THE RING OR 9 OF THE GLOBE AND THE PLANE WHEREIN IT MOVES VERY LITTLE OR NO THING DIFFERRING FROM THAT OF THE RING THAT IS TO SAY INTERSECTING THE ORB OF SATURN 4S22 AND 10S 22  1 A WITH AN ANGLE OF 23 12 DEGREES SO AS TO BE NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE EARTHS EQITATOR WHENCE THE LATITUDE OF THE APOGAEON SEMICICLE FROM 4S 22 TO 10S 22 OF SATURNS LONGITUDE WILL BE NORTHERN AND OF THE OTHER SEMICIRCLES SOUTHERN AND THE CONTRARY IN THE OTHER HALF OF SATURNS LONGITUDE TO WIT FROM 10S 22 TO 4S 22 OF HIS DISTANCE FROM THE FIRST STAR OF  IT FOLLOWS NOW TO SHEW HOW BY THE HELP OF THIS TABLE TO COMPUTE THE PLACE OF THIS SATELLITE TO ANY TIME REQUIRED FIRST WE MUST HAVE THE TRUE LONGITUDE OF SATURN FROM THE EARTH AND NUMBRED FROM THE FIRST STAR OF  OR RATHER THE PLACE OF THE EARTH VIEWED FROM SATURN TOGETHER WITH ITS LATITUDE FROM THE ORB OF SATURN BUT THAT BEING NEVER FULLY  OF A DEGREE WE NEGLECT

EXACTLY WITH THE DESCRIPTION AND FIGURE OF MONSIEUR HUGENS M 2 88 I HERE CALL THE PLANE OF THIS SATELLITS ORB WHICH HITHERTO I SUP POSE THE SAME WITH THAT OF THE RING SATURNS EQUINOCTIAL NOT THAT ANY DISCOVERY HATH BEEN ABLE TO PROVE THAT THE AXIS OF THAT GLOBE IS AT RIGHT ANGLES THERETO BUT BECAUSE IT HAS PLEASED MR HUGENS TO CALL IT SO AND LIKEWISE BECAUSE IT IS SO NEARLY PARALLEL TO OUR GLOBES EQUI NOCTIAL NEVERTHELESS TO SPEAK MY OPINION I BELIEVE THAT THE AXIS IS INCLINED AND THAT NOT A LITTLE TO THE PLANE OF THE RING FOR AS THE REFLECTION OF THE SUNS LIGHT FROM THE RING IS A GREAT CONVENIENCE TO THAT HEMISPHERE OF SATURN WHICH BEHOLDS ITS ILLUMINATE SIDE SO THE OTHER HEMISPHERE IS VERY MUCH INCOMMODED BY THE SHADOW OF THE RING WHICH FOR MANY MONTHS AND IN SOME PARALLELS FOR SE VERAL YEARS OCCASIONS A CONTINUAL NIGHT BY THE INTERCEPTION OF THE SUNS BEAMS WHICH IS A CONSEQUENCE THAT DEMONSTRATIVELY FOLLOWS THE POSITION OF THE RING IN THE PLANE OF SATURNS EQUATOR NOW THIS GREAT INCONVENIENCE WOULD BE IN SOME MEASURE RELIEVED BY THE OB LIQUE POSITION OF THE AXIS FOR THEN THE PARALLELS OF LATITUDE INTER SECTING THE PLANE OF THE RING MANY AND IN MOST CASES ALL OF THEM MIGHT FOR SOME TIME IN EVERY DIURNAL REVOLUTION OF THE GLOBE FREE THEMSELVES FROM THIS ECLIPSE WHICH OTHERWISE WERE SUFFICIENT TO RENDER THIS GLOBE OF SATURN UNFIT FOR ANY SETTLED HABITATION BUT THIS IS BUT CONJECTURE THE OTHER TWO SATELLITES OF SATURN DISCOVERED BY SIGNOR CASSINI AT PARIS ANNO 1672 AND 1673 I MUST CONFESS I COULD NEVER YET SEE I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THEY DISAPPEAR FOR ABOUT 23 OF SATURNS REVOLUTION AND WERE ONLY TO BE SEEN WHEN THE ANSAE WERE VERY SMALL IT BEING SUPPOSED THAT THE LIGHT WHICH PROCEEDS FROM THE ANSAE WHEN CONSIDE RABLY OPENED MIGHT HIDE THESE SATELLITS IN THE YEAR 1685 WHEN THE ANSAE WILL BE QUITE VANISHED WILL BE A PROPER TIME TO LOOK AFTER THEM THAT SO WE MAY BRING THEIR MOTION TO RULE AND KNOW WHERE TO FIND THEM FOR WANT OF WHICH KNOWLEDGE TIS LIKELY THEY ARE AT PRE SENT NOT TO BE FOUND OBSER

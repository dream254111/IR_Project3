liiller Andreas Hansen and other spokesmen of the later theories touching Aryan origins the area of characterization of the WestEuropean culture as well as of that dolichoblond racial stock that bears this culture is the region bor dering on the North Sea and the Baltic and its center of diffusion is to be sought on the southern shores of the Baltic This region is in  MATTHAEUS MUCH Die Heimat der IndogermanenNOTES 27I a manner then the primary focus of that culture of enterprise that has reshaped the scheine of life for mankind during the Christian era Its spirit of enterprise and adventure has carried this race to a degree of material success that is without example in history whether in point of the extent or of the scope of its achievements Up to the present the culminating achievement of this enterprise is dominion in business and its most finished instrument is the quasivoluntary coalition of forces known as a Trust In its method and outward form this enterprise of the Indo germanic racial stock has varied with the passage of time and the change of circumstances but in its spirit and objective end it has maintained a singularly consistent character through all the muta tions of name and external circumstance that have passed over it in the course of history In its earlier more elemental expression this enterprise takes the form of raiding by land and sea A shrewd interpretation migiht without particular violence to the facts find a coalition of forces of the kind which is later known as a Trust in the Barbarian raids spoken of as the Valkerwanderung Stuch an interpretation would seem remote however and not particularly apt The begirl nings of a bonta fide trust enterprise are of a more businesslike charac ter and have left a record more amenable to the tests of accountancy A trust as that terml is colloquially understood is a business organization NNow the line of enterprise of indigenous growth in the north European cultural region which first falls into settled shape as an orderly organized business is the traffic of those seafaring men of the North known to fame as the Vikings And it is in this traffic so far as the records show that a trust with all essential features is first organized The term  viking  covers somewhat euphe mistically two main facts piracy and slavetrade Without both of these lines of business the traffic could not be maintained in the long run and both but more particularly the latter presume as an indispensable condition to their successful prosecution a regular market and an assured demand for the output It is a traffic in which in order to get the best results a relatively large initial invest ment must be sunk and the period of turnoverthe period of production is necessarily of some duration the risk is also con siderable Further certain technological prerequisites must be met in the way particularly of shipbuilding navigation and the manu272 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY facture of weapons an adequate accumulation of capital goods must be had coupled with a sagacious spirit of adventure there must also be an available supply of labor There appears to have been a con currence of all these circumstances together with favorable market conditions in the southBaltic region from about the sixth century onward the circumstances apparently growing gradually more favorable through the succeeding four centuries The viking trade appears to have grown up gradually on the Baltic seaboard as well as in the Sound country and throughout the fjord region of Norway as a byoccupation of the farming population Its beginnings are earlier than any records so that the earliest traditions speak of it as an institution well understood and fully legitimate The welltodo freehold farmers including some wlho laid claim to the rank of jarl seem to have found it an agreeable and honorable diversion as well as a lucrative employment for their surplus wealth and labor supply From such sporadic and occasional beginnings it passed presently into an independently organized and selfsustained line of business enterprise and in the course of time it attained a settled business routine and a defined code of profes sional ethics Syndication of a loose form had begun as early as the oldest accounts extant but it is evident from the way in which the matter is spoken of that combination had not at that date  say about the beginning of the ninth century long been the common practice It was not then a matter of course The early combina tions were relatively small and transient They took the form of  gentlemens agreements pools working arrangements division of territory etc rather than hard and fast syndicates In those early days a combine would be formed for a season between two or more capitalistundertakers for the most part employing their own capital only without recourse to credit although credit arrange ments occur quite early but are not very common in the earlier recorded phases of the trade Such a loose combine say about the middle of the ninth century might comprise from two to a dozen boats What may be called the normal unit in the trade at that time was a boat of perhaps thirty tons burden with an effective crew of some forty men Boats and crews gradually increase both in size and efficiency for a century and a half after that time Svndication of an increasingly close texture and increasingly permanent effect appears to have rapidly grown in favor through the ninth and tenth centuries The reasons for this movement ofNOTES 273 coalition are plain The volutme of the trade as well as its terri torial extension increased uninterruptedly The technique of the trade was gradually improved and the equipment and management were improved and reduced to standard forms The tonnage employed at any given time can of course not be ascertained with anything like a confident approximation but its steady increase is unmistakable Year by year the boats and crews increase in average size as well as in number until by the middle of the tenth celntury the number of men and ships engaged as well as the volume of capital invested in the trade are probably larger than the corre sponding figures for any other forml of lucrative enterprise at that timne It is at that time altogether the bestorganized line of enter prise in the WestEuropean region in respect of its business manage nmenit and the most efficient and progressive in respect of its equip ment and technology At a conservative guess the aggregate number of ships engaged about the middle of the tenth century must have appreciably exceeded six hundred and may have reached one thousand with crews which had also grown gradually larger until they may by this time have averaged seventy or eighty men There was consequently what would in modern phrase be called an overproduction of piratical craft overinvestment in the viking trade and consequent cutthroat competition The various coalitions came into violent conflict and many of them went under with great resultant loss of capital impoverishment of welltodo families hardship and demoralization of the entire trade Added to these untoward conditions within the trade was the open disfavor of the crown in each of the three Scandinavian king doms The traffic had long passed out of the stage at which it had offered a lucrative opening for farmers sons who were tired of the farm and eager to find excitement reputation and creature com forts in that wider human contact and busier life for which the tedium of the farm had sharpened their appetites The larger capitalists alone could succeed as organizers or directors of a viking concern under the changed conditions The common run of well todo farmers had neither the tangible assets nor the goodwill requisite to the successful promotion of a new company of free booters At the best their sons could enter the business only as employees and with but a very uncertain outlook to speedy promo tion to an executive position On the other hand as the trade became better organized in stronger hands with a larger equipment274 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY and as the competition within the trade grew more severe the black mail from which much of the profits of the trade was drawn grew more excessive and more uncertain both as to its amount and as to the manner and incidents with which it was levied As competition grew severe and the small vikings practically disappeared and as the demoralization that goes with cutthroat competition set in the livelihood of the common people at whose expense the vikings lived grew progressively more precarious and even their domestic peace and household industry grew insecure Popular sentiment was running strongly against the whole traffic So much so indeed as to threaten the tenure of courts and sovereigns if the popular hard ship incident to the continuance of the trade were not abated The politicians therefore made a strenuous show of effort to regulate or even to repress the viking organizations Outright and indiscriminate repression was scarcely a feasible remedy certainly not an agreeable one The viking companies were a source of strength to the country both in that they might be drawn on for support in case of war and in that they brought funds into the country The remedy to which the politicians turned by preference therefore was a regulation of the companies in such a manner as to let the foreigner pay the tax to adapt a modern phrase If the freebooters of a given state could be induced by stringent regula tions to prey upon the people of the neighboring states and particu larly if they worked at crosspurposes with similar companies of freebooters domiciled in such neighboring states it was then plain to the sagacious politicians of those days that the companies might be more of a blessing than a curse On trial it was found that this policy of control gave at the best but very dubious results and corT sequently the repressive hand of the authorities perforce fell with increasingly rigorous pressure on the viking organizations particu larly on the smaller ones which were scarcely of national importance The competition in the trade was too severe to admit of a consistent avoidance of excesses and irregularities on the part of thie vikings and these irregularities obliged the authorities to interfere Under these circumstances it is plain that no viking combine could hope to prosper in the long run unless it were strong enough to take an international position and to maintain a practical monopoly of the trade International in these premises means within the Scandinavian countries In the days of its finest development the viking trade was domiciled in the Scandinavian countries almostNOTES 275 exclusively T1his means the two Scandinavian peninsulas with Iceland the Faroes Orkneys Hebrides and the Scandinavian por tions of Scotland To this for completeness of statementis to be added a stretch of Wendish seaboard on the south of the Baltic and a negligible patch of Germani territory The trade so far as regards its home offices to use a modern phrase gathered in the main about two chief centers the Orkneys and the south end of the Baltic Outlying regions such as the Norwegian fjord country and the Hebrides are by no means negligible but the two regions named above are after all the chief seats of the traffic and of these two centers the Baltic chiefly Danishregion is in many respects the more notable Its viking traffic is better more regularly organized is carried on with a more evident sense of a solidarity of interests and a more consistent view to a longterm prosperity As one might say looking at the matter from the modern standpoint it has miore of a look of stability and conservative management such as belongs to an investment btusiness and has less of a speculative air than the trade that centers in the western isles Perhaps it is just on this account because of its greater stability of interests and more conservative animus that the traffic of this region responds with greater alacrity to the pressure of excessive competition and political interference and so enters on a policy of larger and closer coalition It may be added that many of the great captains of adventure in this region are men of good family and substantial standing in the community As may often happen in a like conjuncture wlhen the irksomeness of this competitive situation in the Baltic was fast becoming intolerable there arose a man of farseeing sagacity and settled principles of executive ability and businesslike integrity who saw the needs of the hour and the avail able renmedy and who saw at the same glance his own opportunity of gain This man was Palnatoki the descendant of an honorable line of country gentlemen in the island of Funen whose family had from time immemorial borne an active and prudent part in the trade and had been well seen at court and in society He was a man of mature experience with a large investriment in the traffic and with a body of  goodwill  that gave him perhaps his most decisive advantage During the reign of Harald Gormsson about the middle of the tenth century Palnatoki seems to have cast about for a basis oni which to promote an international coalition of vikings such as would276 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY put an end to headlong competition in the trade and would at the same time be placed above the accidents of national politics To this end it was necessary to find a neutral ground on which to establish the home office of the concern Such a medievalScandinavian New Jersey was the Wendish kingdom at the south of the Baltic J6msborg on the island of Wollin at the mouth of the Oder seems to have been a resort of vikings before Palnatoki organized his company there and strengthened the harbor which may have been fortified by those who held it before him Here the new com pany was incorporated under a special franchise from the Wendish crown with the stipulation that it was to do business only outside the Wendish territories The tangible assets of the corporation were the harbor and fortified town of J6msborg together with the ships and other equipment of such vikings as were admitted to fellowship its intangible assets were its franchise and the goodwill of the promoter and the underlying companies Its bylaws were very strict both as to the discipline of the personnel and as to the distribu tion of earnings The promoter who was the first president of the corporation was given extreme powers for the enforcement of the bylaws and throughout his long incumbency of office he exercised his powers with the greatest discretion and with a most salutary effect This neutral international corporation of piracy rapidly won a great prestige In modern phrase its intangible assets grew rapidly larger Backed by the competitive pressure which the new cor poration was able to bring upon the smaller companies and syndi cates this prestige of the Jomsvikings brought a steady run of applications for admission into the trust The trusts policy was substantially the same as has since become familiar in other lines of enterprise with the difference that in those early days the com petitive struggle took a less sophisticated form Outstanding syndi cates and private firms were given the alternative of submission to the trusts terms or retirement from the traffic There was great nardship among the outstanding concerns especially among that large proportion of them that were unable to meet the scale of requirements imposed on applicants for admission into the trust The qualifications both as to equipment and personniel were extremely strict so that a large percentage of the applicants were excluded and the unfortunates who failed of admission found themselves in a doubtful position that grew more precarious with every year thatNOTES 277 passed Practically such concerns were either frozen out of the business or forced into a liquidation which permanently wound up their affairs and terminated their corporate existence The accounts extant are of course not reliable in minute details being not strictly contemporary nor are they cast in such modern terms as would give an easy comparison with presentday facts The chief documents in the case are J6rnsvikingasaga Saxo Gram maticus Heiniskringla and Olafssaga Tryggvasonar but nearly the whole of the saga literature bears on the development of the viking trade and characteristic references to the Jomsviking trust occur throughout The evidence afforded by these accounts converges to the conclusion that toward the close of the tenth century the trust stood in a high state of prosperity and was in a position virtually to dictate the course of the traffic for all that portion of the vikinlg trade that centered in the Baltic Its prestige and influence were strong wherever the traffic extended even in the region of the western isles and in the fjord country of Norway It had even come to be a factor of firstrate consequence in international politics and its power was feared and courted by those two sovereigns who established the Danish rule in England as well as by their Swedish Norwegian and Russian contemporaries It is probably not an over stateiiient to say that the Danish conquest of England would not have been practicable except for the alliance of the trust with Svend which enabled him to turn his attention from the complications of Scandinavian politics to his English interests The extent of the trusts material equipment at the height of its prosperity is a matter of surmise rather than of statistical informa tion Some notion of its strength may be gathered from the state ment that the fortified harbor of J6msborg included within its castellated seawall an inclosed basin capable of floating three hundred ships at anchor In the great raid against the kingdom of Norway whose failure inaugurated the disintegration of the trust the number of ships sent out is variously given by different authorities The Jo6svikingasaga says that they numbered one long hundred This fleet however was made up of craft selected from among the ships that were under the immediate command of four of the great cap tains of adventure The fleet as it lay in the Sound before the final selection is said to have numbered I85 but the context shows that this fleet was but a fraction of the aggregate Jomsviking tonnage Of this disastrous expedition but a fraction returned yet various278 JOURNAL OF POLITICAL ECONOMY later expeditions of the J6msvikings are mentioned in which some scores of their ships took part The trust having become an international power it undertook to shape the destiny of nations and dynasties and it broke under the strain It or its directors took a contract to bring Norway into subjection to the Danish crown Partly through untoward accidents partly through miscalculation and hurried preparations it failed in this undertaking which brought the affairs of the trust to a spec tacular crisis From this disaster it never recovered With the opening of the eleventh century the viking trust fell into abeyance and in a few years it disappeared from the field There are several good reasons for its failure On the death of its founder the man agement had passed into the hands of Sigvaldi a man of less sagacity and less integrity as well as of more unprincipled personal ambition and somewhat given to flighty ventures in the field of politics It was Sigvaldis overweening personal ambition that committed the corporation to the illadvised expedition against Norway The trust moreover being supreme within its field the discipline grew lax and its exactions grew arbitrary sometimes going to unprovoked excesses As one might say too little thought was given to  econo mies of production and the charges were pushed beyond what the traffic would bear But for all that in spite of its meddling in politics and in spite of jobbery and corruption in its management the trust still had a fair outlook for continued success except that the bottom dropped out of the trade For better or worse the slave trade in the north of Europe collapsed on the introduction of Chris tianitv at least so far as regards the trade in Christians and without a slave market the viking enterprise had no chance of reasonable earnings At the same iime the risk and hardships of the traffic the  cost of production grew heavier as the countries to the south became better able to defend their shores The passenger traffic failed almost entirely and the goods traffic was in a disorganized and unprofitable state The costs were fast becaming prohibitive even to men so enterprising and necessitous as the Norwegian freebooters The situation changed in such a way as to leave the trust out Some show of corporate existence was still maintained for a short period after the trusts great crisis but there was an end of discipline and authoritative control The minor concerns and private establish ments that had once formed part of the trust continued in the trade on an independent footing but with decreasing regularity and withNOTES 279 dilninishing strength As the equipment wore out it was not replaced and the trade lapsed The great captains of the industry like Sigvaldi Thorkel Haraldson Sigurd Kapa and Vagn Akason turned their holdings to the service of the dynastic politics which were then engaging the attention of the northern countries Much of this body of enterprise and wealth was exhausted in working out the imperialistic schemes of expansion of Svend and Knut the Great and what was left over shared the fortunes of the other available forces of the Scandinavian countries being dissipated in political dissensions extortionate government organizations and the estab lishment of a church and a nobility V

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074815,HOW THE HIGH SCHOOL MAY ADVANCE PATRIOTISM PART II,I244475,HOW THE HIGH SCHOOL MAY ADVANCE PATRIOTISM 293 WAY FOR VITAL WORK THE DEMAND IS FOR LESSER AMOUNT OF RE QUIRED WORK AND FOR ENRICHMENT THE EXERTION OF MORAL FORCE AS WELL AS THE SKILLFUL EMPLOYMENT OF DRILL MUST FIND PLACE IN EVERY RECITATION IT MAKES NO DIFFERENCE WHETHER A COURSE COMES UNDER THE HEAD OF INFORMATION COURSES OR UNDER THAT OF TRAINING COURSES SO LONG AS IT FITS PROPERLY INTO A WELL ROUNDED WHOLE CHARACTER BUILDING IS THE REAL OBJECT THE ETHICAL ELE MENT MUST NOT BE ABSENT FROM ANYTHING TAUGHT AND THE NATURAL DEVELOPMENT AS TO SUBJECTS MUST BE ALLOWED NO SUBJECT SHOULD BE EXCLUDED AS A SUBJECT BUT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT IS NOT REACHED SPECIFICALLY IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CHILDS MENTAL AND MORAL POWERS WITHIN HIGH SCHOOL YEARS THE TESTIMONY OF ACTUAL EX PERIENCE IS HERE BOTH SOLE EVIDENCE AND CONCLUSIVE EVIDEUCE AND NO A PRIORI CONCLUSION IS OF VALUE THE TEACHERS ARE READY AND WILLING TO MAKE A NOBLERESPONSE TO THIS DEMAND THAT THEY GIVE GREATER PROMINENCE TO THE ETHICAL ELEMENT AND WE SHALL SOON FIND NONE WHO ARE MERELY DRILL MASTERS ON SO MANY PAGES OF U S SCHOOL REGULATIONS BUT ALL WILL BE MINISTERS OF LIGHT TEACHING TO THE YOUNG THOSE THINGS THE KNOWLEDGE OF WHICH CONTINUES IN HEAVEN T HOW THE HIGH SCHOOL MAY ADVANCE PATRIOTISM PART II ALARMISTS ARE BEGINNING TO CRY ALOUD THAT PATRIOTISM IS DE CLINING IN OUR PRECIOUS NATIVE LAND IT IS PROBABLY TRUE THAT THE ERA OF BUOYANT BOASTING PATRIOTISM IS FOREVER PAST BUT OF CALM AND IF NECESSARY OBSTINATELY RESISTANT PATRIOTISM THERE CERTAINLY IS NO LACK YET THE FIRST INDICATION OF A DECLINE OF PATRIOTISM SHOULD BE WATCHED FOR AS ELIZABETHS SCOUTSHIPS WATCHED FOR THE SPANISH ARMADA AND EVERY RESOURCE SHOULD BE STRAINED TO PROVE THAT THE LION OF PATRIOTIC LOVE BUT SEEMED TO DROWSE DEFEAT AT THE HANDS OF A FOREIGN FOE MAY BE BORNE WITH FORTITUDE AND PROVE A BLESSING IN DISGUISE CURTAILED IN IPART OF SCHOOL MOTTOTHE SCHOOL REVIEW TERRITORY AND POPULATION A NATION MAY SHINE AS A MORE BRILLIANT LIGHT FOR THE VERY CONCENTRATION OF ITS RAYS THE SLOW DECAY WHICH FOLLOWS THE DECLINE OF PATRIOTISM IN THE HEART OF A PEOPLE IS AN UNMITIGATED CALAMITYA DEADLY DISEASE WHICH UNLESS ARRESTED AT A VERY EARLY STAGE MEANS CERTAIN AND MISERABLE DEATH IN ANY CASE PREVENTION IS BETTER THAN CURE THE AMERI CAN HIGH SCHOOL SHOULD BE AN AGENCY PREVENTIVE OF A DECLINE OF PATRIOTISM IN TWO OR AT LEAST THREE YEARS ITS MALE GRADUATES WILL BE VOTERS IN TIME ITS FEMALE GRADUATES WILL BE SISTERS WIVES MOTHERS OF VOTERS THEIR FREE EDUCATION AFFORDS CONCRETE EVIDENCE OF THEIR COUNTRYS LOVE FOR THEM THEY ARE OF AN AGE AT INCE PLASTIC AND RATIONAL BOTH ENTHUSIAS TIC AND DELIBERATE WHAT A GLORIOUS OPPORTUNITY TO INCULCATE YES STAMP IN A SENSE OF REVERENCE OBLIGATION AND LOVE WORK FROM THIS VANTAGE GROUND SPEAK OFTEN ALSO OF THE GLORIOUS PAST THE BOLD WORKING OUT OF OUR NATIONS DESTINY IN THE FACE OF EUROPES CONTEMPT AND OUR OWN POVERTY OF EVERY THING EXCEPT HOPE AND PLUCK BOLDLY TEACH THAT THERE IS NO FAIRER HAPPIER LAND THAN OURS THAT NO FOREIGN FOE WOULD SO MUCH AS THINK OF INVADING OUR BOUNDARIES WHILE THE TRAITOR WITHIN CARRIES THE HALTER ABOUT HIS NECK KEEP THE FLAG IN VIEW AND DO IT REVERENCE HERBART TAUGHT THAT THE CONCEPTION OF DUTY ARISES FROM THE EXISTENCE OF HINDRANCES TO THE ATTAINMENT OF VIRTUE LET EVERY PUPIL THEREFORE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THREAT ENING THE PROSPERITY AND HAPPINESS OF OUR COUNTRYTHAT ITS FU TURE DEPENDS UPON THE UNSELFISH AND PATIENT DEVOTION OF TRUE AMERICANS IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHADOW FORTH THESE THINGS WITH OUT GOING INTO POLITICAL QUESTIONS ENDEAVOR TO MAKE IT A BOYS OR GIRLS AMBITION IN SOME WAY TO SERVE HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AS THE SUREST WAY TO INDUCE HIM TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY IN SHOW ING HIM THE CLOUDS NEVER FORGET TO POINT OUT THE EVERPRESENT GLIMMER OF THE SILVER LINING THE LITTLE CANDLES OF GOOD DEEDS STILL SHINE IN THE DARK ROOM OF THE THREATENING PRESENT MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS MAY BE MADE OF GREAT ASSISTANCE IN THIS WORK OF ADVANCING PATRIOTISM OR AS I PREFER IN PREVENT 294HOW THE HIGH SCHOOL MAY ADVANCE PATRIOTISM ING ITS DECLINE FUTURE WAR IS NOT NECESSARILY SYMBOLIZED IN THESE ORGANIZATIONS  RATHER THE NECESSARY WARS OF THE PAST AND A PRESENT DETERMINATION TO RALLY ROUND THE FLAG WHETHER THREAT ENED BY THE WEAKER FOE OF VIOLENCE OR BY THE STRONGER FOE OF ANARCHISM AND SOCIAL DISCONTENT SINGING OF NATIONAL AIRS ACCOMPANIED BY SHORT PATRIOTIC ADDRESSES SHOULD I THINK FRE QUENTLY FORM A PART OF THE SCHOOL EXERCISES MORE THAN ALL HOWEVER EACH TEACHER SHOULD FEEL IT HIS DUTY AS OCCASION OF FERS IN THE MULTITUDINOUS INCIDENTS OF SCHOOL LIFE TO SET VIBRAT ING THE CHORD OF NATIVE LOVE AND PRIDE WHEN THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS ARE ONCE IMPRESSED WITH THE NEED OF THEIR HELP IN PRE VENTING A POSSIBLE DECLINE IN PATRIOTISM THEY WILL NOT BE CALLED TWICE IF ANY ONE THINKS THAT HE SEES SIGNS OF DECLINING PA TRIOTISM LET HIM SOUND THE CALL IF IT IS SECONDED BY THE PUB LIC INCREASED ACTIVITY IN THIS DIRECTION WILL AT ONCE APPEAR THE HIGH SCHOOL TEACHERS OF AMERICA ARE NOT EYESERVANTS I BELIEVE THAT THERE IS NOT ONE OF THEM MAN OR WOMAN IN THIS BROAD LAND WHO IS NOT READY TO DO YOEMANS WORK IN OUR COUN TRYS SERVICE TEACHING LOVE FOR HER VOTING FOR HER BEST INTERESTS NURSING HER SICK AND WOUNDED IF NECESSARY DYING FOR HER J REMNSEN BISHOP CINCINNATI 295

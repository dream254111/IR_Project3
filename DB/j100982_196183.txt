j100982,Journal of the American Geographical and Statistical Society,196183,On the Manner of Taking a Census,i210170,ON TIlE MANNER OF TAKING A CENSUS To the Cormmittee of Putblication of the Am Geo anld Stat Society GENTLFMENI propose herewith to com municate some of the results of my observation upon the difficulties to be encountered in taking a census of the population and the statistics required by law to be obtained therewith Having had the principal care of preparing the blanks and instructions and of answering letters of inquiry from the marshals appointed for taking the census of the State of New York in 1855 and the entire direction of the labor of preparing the returns of that census for pub lication I could not fail of meeting with many of the difficulties that must attend every enter prise of this kind and in a greater or less de gree impair the accuracy of its results It is obvious that the preparation of the sum maries and abstracts embodying these results involves no source of error which is not under control and that with suitable precautions and careful checks and revisions no errors need to arise in this part of the labor To secure accuracy in this service it should be performed by competent persons under one general direc tion and with uniform instructions for settling the various points of difficulty that are liable to arise I am convinced that labor saving 86 MARCH1859 ON THE MANNEU OF TAKING A CENSUS 87 methods may to a considerable degree be in troduced to facilitate this branch of the ser vice and that simplc mechanical appliances may be used to advantage to expedite the work Our principal care must therefore be to ob tain correct returns from the marshals and omitting for the present any discussion as to what these returns should embrace 1 will limit this letter to a statement of what apiear to be inherent and to some extent unavoidable difficulties that will be found attending this allimportant duty There can be no doubt but that the census takers have been ovcr chargcd with duties that might better be per formed by other persons and in a different way There is not an inquiry they are required to make which is not important in its place or which is not useful to the legislator and of value to the statistician and the civil economist But when we add to the minute inquiries of personal statistics the registration of births marriages and deaths for the year or the ten years prcviousthe minute statistics of agri culture and manufactures in their immcnsc combinations and dctailsstatistics of dwcllings of churches and religious societiesof schools and schoolhotisesof newspapers and periodi calsand of such new points of inquiry as each succeeding census has had appended to its schedules it will not be deemed amiss to rank as first on the list of dcsidcrata a high degree of qualification on the part of those charged with making the enumeration As these per sons are not in all cases selected from any pe culiar fitness they are thought to possess it will sometimes happen that they will fail to appreciate or neglect to perforin some part of their duties and their returns will show pal pable deticiencies in some one or more par ticulars These defects are perhaps due less to the census inarshals than to the law and while I would not abridge but rather extcnd our fa cilitics for obtaining full statistics upon the points last enumerated I would deem it a sub ject worthy of grave considcration whether we might not devise some more direct and appro priate method of arriving at these dcsirable results In the best European systems the personal census is made a distinct and indepen dent branch of inquiry and in our own country it will generally be found that this portion has received the most attention as if it had been regarded the primary object while the remain ing inquiries had been considered as incidcntally and more or less remotely connected with it As we multiply inquiries upon collateral sub jects we necessarily extend the time required by each enumerator for the performance of his duties and consequently adinit into every de partment the crrors iucident to changes and removals by which the proper persons cannot be found to answer the questions required Lapse of time will also impair the memory of many persons and the precision of the returns will be found invariably to bear an inverse ratio to the interval within which the enumeration is made The nearer we approach a point of time the greater will be the chances of success and not until the census is taken upon one day can we hope to secure everything desirable in point of accuracy Another source of error will be found in the want of a uniform knowledge of their duties by the census marshals or a misconstruction of the intention of the several columns of the sche dules This error is always more liable to oc cur in the collateral inquiries than in those re lating to the population Two persons might  for example report a very unequal amount of improved and unimproved land in the same dis trict by one including and the other rejecting from the column of improved land a natural meadow or marsh which was partly available for tillage This liability to error can only be remedied by very minute and carefully pre pared instructions fully indexed and conveni ently arranged for reference In many in stances the persons charged with taking the census might be previously convened the plan and intentions of the schedules explained by some person thoroughly informed their prin ciples discussed and questions upon doubtful points answered I consider this measure fully88 REPUBLIC OF BUENOS AYRES March applicable to a State census and should not hesitate to urge its adoptiou whcnever suffi cient numbers of the enumerators could be as seinbled A single evening thus spent in mu tual discussion would do much towards pre paring these officers for an intelligent and uni form discharge of their duties and enable them to coiumaice their labors with a fuller apprecia tion of the subject than they might under other ciivumstances fud them From the short pe riod devoted to obtaining the census a person has no chance of acquiring that facility for the transaction of the business that grows out of long experience and habitual application as we constantly see in other pursuits of lifeand from the long interval that occurs between two enumerations it can scarcely be expected that the experience acquired upon one census will be to any extent available in the next We must therefore depend upon preliminary in struction of the kind above alluded to for any thing we have to expect beond the ordinary sagacity and intclligence of the officers charged with the duty of collecting these statistics It is not probable that the census marshals will generally inform themselves of the varicd deductions which may arise from their labors or even that those who have given the subject the careful study of years can fully realize the beautiful generalizations that may grow out of these facts when they shall have accumulated through a long series of years for when the tables of a census lose their interests as charts of existing society they become pages of his tory and landmarks of progress Yours respectfully Franklin B Hough Albany Feb 17 1859

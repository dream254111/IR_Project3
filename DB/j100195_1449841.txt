have been obtained too in I Mace ii 57 by remembering that lVln especially in the books of the Maccabees would mean pious acts rather than mercy It is hard to understand how David for being merciful inherited the throne The writer however might well have cited Davids piety as the cause of his preferment Mercy was hardly a characteristic of the Biblical David however much his virtues were idealized In the preceding comments undue prominence has perhaps been given to passages in which I venture to differ from the conclusions arrived at by the compilers of the version under review But these comments must not be taken to imply that I do not fully appreciate the magnitude of the service the Revisers have rendered The Revisers might well address captious critics in the words prefaced by the grandson of Jesus the son of Sirach to the Greek translation of his fathers wisdom Ye are intreated therefore to read with favour and attention and to pardon us if in any parts of what we have laboured to interpret we may seem to fail in some of the phrases But the authors of this translation have no need to plead for mercy The most rigid and candid justice must assign to parts of their work a very high place and to all of their work an honourable and respectable place among the great translations of the present century I ABRAHAMS THE SIFRE ZUTA Nlt 5bD Sifr4 Suta di eig Sifre Numeri in 2 Recension zum ersten Male nach dem handschriftlichen Midrasch hagadol Jalkut Simeoni u a gesammelt und mit Anmericungen versehen nebst einer ausfiihrlichen Einleitung herazsgegeben von Dr B KONIGS BERGER I Lieferung Frankfurt a M Kauffmann 1894 24 Blatter 8vo IN addition to the Sifre on the Book of Numbers there was another Tannaite Midrash several fragments of which are preserved in the Jalkuzt Shimeoni With these and other fragments as a basis to work on the late Nehemiah Briill contributed to the Jubilee Volume pub lished on the occasion of Graetzs seventieth birthday a descriptive sketch of the lost Midrash termed the Minor Sifre Ktlt D He endeavoured to demonstrate that that Midrash did not belong to a late period as even Weisss History of Tradition assumes but that 329THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW it contains indisputably genuine antique traditions and was there fore to be regarded as an important source for ancient Halacha Soon after the appearance of Briills essay Dr Hoffman issued in the form of an appendix to the Report of the Berlin Rabbinical Seminary for 18867 an excellent introduction to the Halachic Midrashim in which the Minor Sifre is thoroughly discussed and Briills sketch is com pleted and occasionally corrected Hoffman establishes the position that the Sifre Zuta emanated from R Akibas school while the ordinary Sifre on Numbers exhibits the peculiarities of the Midrashim belonging to the school of R Tshmael About the same time Dr Israel Levy called attention in his important contribution A Word on the Mechilta of R Simeon  Jahresbericht of the Breslau Jewish Theological Seminary 1889 to the fact that the major portion of the Sifre Zuta is to be found in the Miscellany known as Midrash Haggadol This Midrash the promised publication of which by Mr Schechter will it is hoped not be too long delayed excerpted the lost Tannaite Mid rashim to the Books of Exodus and Numbers It thus affords us special means for completing and confirming the fragments of the Sifre Zuta to be collected from the Jalkut Shimeoni The realization of N Briills wishexpressed at the close of his weighty essaythat a critical edition of the fragments of the Sifre Zuta might be prepared was rendered feasible by the discovery of the Midrash Haggadol Dr Konigsberger has now resolved to make this wish a reality and enrich Midrashic literature with a complete and critical edition of the extant Elements of the Sifre And worthy of a cordial welcome is the first instalment of what promises to be a very im portant work In The Sources of the Halacha part I Berlin 1890 Dr Konigsberger already proved that he is quite at home in the region of Halachic Midrash and that his acquaintance with the Midrash Haggadol MS in the Berlin Royal Library is of a close and intimate character He concludes that essay with a discussion of the Sifre Zuta and mostly confirms Dr Hoffmans results He has now with the assistance of the Berlin ZunzStiftung fortunately been able to publish the first part of his edition which we trust will be followed by its successors at short intervals It is impossible with the materials before us adequately to gauge the editors aims and tendencies as the elaborate Introduction which will unfold the principles on which the edition of the text has been formed will not appear till the close of the entire publication But even the simple comprehension of the notes beneath the text is made more difficult than it need be by the authors excessive use of abbr6viations in giving his references to the sources and other writings These abbreviations prove stumblingblocks even to the scholar and their elucidation should 330CRITICAL NOTICES have accompanied the first part It took me some time I confess before I could make out the sense of fflntt2l in the second and other notes The reference is of course to rnil WID a Miscellany similar in character to the Midrash Haggadol which however is by no means so well known that it should not at least the first time have been cited in unabbreviated form Dr KOnigsbergers notes are besides full of other abbreviations which must retard the progress of ordinary readers who are not thoroughly familiar with the literature of the subject The editor of a new text ought surely to take this class as well as the specialists into account On the other hand the Rabbinical Hebrew in which these notes are written is fairly easy to follow If these innumerable abbreviations in the use of which the writer has copied earlier halachic writers effect a saving of space economy has not been studied in the number and bulk of the notes It would be desirable in future parts rigidly to confine the comments to the citation of parallel passages and the establishment of a correct text and its elucidation The attention devoted to modern authors and commentaries on the Midrash is not pertinent to the main purpose which the editor should keep in view viz to furnish a good text of the Sifre Zuta and facilitate its critical study Any other observations would find a more suitable place in the Introduction I am afraid that Dr K6nigsbergers want of self restraint hampers the progress of his edition Unnecessary notes swell the bulk and materially increase the cost of publication In the part before us which consists of 48 pages a very small portion I a4 b is on the first four chapters of Numbers while the larger part 4b24b contains the Midrash on chapters 5 and 6 If the annotation in the rest of the edition should be on the same scale the entire text of the Small Sifre will attain the dignity of a volume of brobdignagian size In regard to the text we are nowhere explicitly told that the Midrash Haggadol is the source from which it is taken That fact can only be gathered from the citations of parallel passages in the notes The Introduction will probably elucidate this important detail Mr Schechters coming edition of the Midrash Haggadol will serve to check complete and correct Dr Konigsbergers text which seems to be exclusively based upon the Berlin Manuscript As however a number of years must elapse before the English savants edition will reach Numbers we owe a debt to Dr Konigsberger for the early opportunity he affords us of reconstructing the  Sifre Zuta from the Midrash Haggadol I have however considerable doubts whether 1 Page 3 b note 41 1 nSr Wn 5niar rn  Ynrc The text then in this passage is taken from another source perhaps the yrnn wiin  331THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW various parts of the text really belong to the Midrash Zuta Thus on page 3 a two passages are introduced with the word NJnITN which the editor himself admits come from the Baraitha On the Tabernacle 7zWn nzrK  these ought not to appear in the text of the Sifre Zuta The word NnT which the Midrash Haggadol uses to indicate that he is quoting a Baraitha is enclosed in brackets But the brackets do not change the character of the quotations which as derived from another source have no right to a place in the text The narrative on page 19 b of the Nazirite vow of Queen Helene of Adiabene is to be found in the Mishna Nazir 111 6 Talmud Babli 19 b whence the Midrash Haggadol might well have taken it How can Dr Konigsberger tell that it belongs originally to the Midrash Zuta  One of the two passages beginning with Xn to which reference has already been made see Jellinek Beth Hammidrash IV I52 closes with the phrase nw nMt m1 2 pI T plN 3 This rule belongs as Dr Hoffman has already pointed out Zur Einleitung p 6 note 2 to R Ishmaels school a circumstance which should have warned our editor against including this passage in the Sifre Zuta a Midrash of Akibas school Very briefly too I would like to point out that in the Midrash on the first Section of Numbers in this edition occurs the phrase   W1D which also belongs to R Ishmaels school 2 b line I6 3 a line i    12O is also found in this chapter see JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW IV p 422 and the two pro miscuously in later chapters I2b line 7 15 b line 6 i6a line 2 I8b line 15 2 b line 6 22 b line 8 It would be rash to conclude hence that the Sifre Zuta is of a mixed character as we are not in a position to gauge the extent to which thQse phrases are used in the original work from which the Midrash Haggadol excerpted As far as can be judged from the first instalment the text has been very carefully edited and occasionally also corrected The sentences are separated by punctuations and scriptural verses are indicated by a widelyspaced type The editors unfortunate omission of Biblical references renders the task of verification somewhat tedious The insertion in the margin of chapter and verse would be an ex cellent feature in ftiture parts Some errata noticed by me are here corrected page 2b line 8 read ntl instead of nf3 pages 2 a and 2b the heading  should be omitted as there is no Midrash on Chapter II page 2 a line 8 read 1q instead of 12l the heading on page 4 a should be I instead

correct reference would have been to Leviticus Rabba ch 2  2 where thirteen passages are indeed gathered so also Tanchuma lnr1n ed Buber p 20 Midrash Samuel ch I9 which fathers the saying on the Agadist Levi I cannot comprehend why Dr K6nigsberger in the same note adds tfin nDln nDDi D YtlM rnq Ilqnn Yr fV1 Wl Where was the need of proof that the compiler of Midrash Haggadol knew the Sifre a position which the editor himself has already sufficiently established in his Quellen der Halacha p I 115 where he states that the Midrash Haggadol borrows largely from the Sifrel Besides he cannot use a passage incorporated in the Sifre Zuta as an argument that the compiler of the Midrash Haggadol had knowledge of the Sifre It is hardly necessaryto state that Ir K6nigsbergers notescontain manyinvaluable observations and references And still it is to be hoped that in the next parts these will decrease in volume and thus the intrinsic value of the edition be enhanced On account of the extreme importance of the Sifre for the investigation both of the Tannaite Midrash and Halacha and of the sources of later works which have copiously borrowed from it eg Bamidbar Rabba and Maimonides Mishne Torah Dr Konigsbergers edition should be most welcome The industry devotion and intimate knowledge exhibited in this under taking merit the approval and support of all friends of Jewish learning May the editors efforts to reconstruct out of existing fragments the literary memorials of the past be crowned with perfect success W BACHER ARAMAIC PROVERBS Aramdische SprichwSrter und

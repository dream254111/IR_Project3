refractive and dispersive Powers by prismatic Reflection By William Hyde Wollaston M D F RS Read June 24 i8o0 IN examining the power with which various substances refract and disperse light I have for some time past employed a me thod unnoticed by writers on optical subjects and as it is not only convenient in common cases of refraction but also capable of affording results not attainable by other means I have been induced to draw up a short account of the method itself and of the most remarkable instances of its application This method was suggested by a consideration of Sir ISAAC NEWTONS prismatic eyeglass the principle of which depends on the reflection of light at the inner surface of a dense re fracting medium Since the range of inclination within which total reflection takes place depends not only on the density of the reflecting prism but also on the rarity of the medium adjacent to it the extent of that range varies with the difference of the densities of the two media When therefore the refractive power of one medium is known that of any rarer medium may be learned by examining at what angle a ray of light will be reflected from it For instance when any object is laid under a prism of flint glass with air alone interposed the internal angle of incidence at which the visual ray begins to be totaily reflected and at which MDCCCII 3 BDr WOLLASTONS Method of examining the object ceases to be seen by refraction is about 39 o but when the object has been dipped in water and brought into contact with the glass it continues visible by means of the higher refractive power of the water as far as 57 of incidence When any kind of oil or any resinous cement is interposed this angle is still greater according to the refractive power of the medium employed and by cements that refract more strongly than the glass the object may be seen through the prism at whatever angle of incidence it is viewed In examining the refractive powers of fluids or of fusible substances the requisite contact is easily obtained but with solids which can in few instances be made to touch to any great extent this cannot be effected without the interposition of some fluid or cement of higher refractive power than the medium under examination Since the surfaces of a stratum so interposed are parallel it will not effect the total deviation of a ray passing through it and may therefore be employed without risk of any error in consequence Thus resin or oil of sassafras interposed between plate glass and any other prism will not alter the result If on the same prism a piece of selenite and another of plate glass be cemented near each other their powers may be com pared with the same accuracy as if they were both in absolute contact with it For such a mere comparison of any two bodies a common triangular prism is best adapted but for the purpose of actual measurement of refractive powers I have preferred the use of a square prism because with a very simple apparatus it shows the sine of refractive power sought without the need of any calculation 366refractive and dispersive Powers 367 Let A Fig i Plate XIV be a square or rectangular prism to which any substance is applied at b and let any ray of light parallel to cb be refracted through the prism in the direction bde Then if ef and ed be taken proportional to the sines that represent the refractive powers of the prism and of airfJg which is intercepted between j and the perpendicular eg will be the corresponding sine to represent the refractive power of the medium b For since edg opposite to ef is the angle of re fraction efg opposite to ed must be equal to the angle of incidence bdh and effg bd dh  sine of cbi sine of hbd All therefore that is requisite for determining the refractive power of h is to find means of measuring the line fg On this principle the instrument in the annexed sketch Fig 2 is con structed On a board ab is fixed a piece of flat deal cd to Which by a hinge at d is jointed a second piece de i o inches long car rying two plane sights at its extremities At e is a second hinge connecting ef 1583 inches long and a third at the other extre mity of ef by whichfg is connected with it At i also is a hinge uniting the radius ig to the middle of ef and then since g moves in a semicircle egf a line joining e and g would be per pendicular tofg The piece cd has a cavity in the middle of it so that when any substance is applied to the middle of the prism P it may continue to rest horizontally on its extremities When ed has been so elevated that the yellow rays in the fringe of colours observable where perfect reflection terminates are seen through the sights the point g by means of a vernier which it carries shows by inspection the length of the sine of refraction sought 3B268 Dr WOLLASTONS Method of examininzg The advantages which this method possesses above the usual mode of examining refractive powers are greater than they may at first sight appear The usual practice has been to form two surfaces of the substance under examination so inclined to each other that the deviation occasioned by them might be measured The inclination of these surfaces to each other must also be known and thence the refractive power might be computed But in the method here proposed it is sufficient to have only one surface and the result is obtained at once without computation The facility of determining refractive powers is consequently such as to render this property of bodies a very convenient test in many philosophical inquiries For discovering the purity of essential oils such an examination may be of considerable utility on account of the smallness of the quantity requisite for trial In oil of cloves for instance I have met with a wide difference The refractive power of genuine oil of cloves is as high as 1535 but I have also purchased oil by this name which did not exceed 1498 and which had probably been adulterated by some less refractive oil For such purposes the refractive power of opaque substances may often be deserving of inquiry which could not be learned by any means at present in use For in the usual mode a certain degree of transparency is absolutely necessary but for trial by contact the most perfect opacity does not occasion the least impediment Among other instances in which I have taken advantage of this circumstance I may mention a substance that had been found in one of the islands of the North Pacific Ocean which to all outward appearance and by various trials seemed to be perfect beeswax although it is supposed that there are no bees in therefractive and dispersive Powers island from which it was brought On placing it by the side of a piece of beeswax in contact with a prism the perfect equality of their refractive powers afforded a strong confirmation of the opinion before formed of their identity For the examination also of media of which the refractive density is not uniform the general method of trial by deviation wholly fails on the contrary by placing a varied medium in contact with a prism all its gradations of density from greatest to least become at once the object of mere inspection An in stance of this may very readily be seen with a piece of gum the surface of which has been moistened for a few minutes when by close application to a prism a refractive power may be discerned varying from that of the water on the surface 1336 to nearly 151 the refractive power of gum arabic I should not so much insist on this advantage were it not for the opportunity hereby afforded of examining the crystalline lens of the eye which is now known to be generally more dense in the centre than at its surface Mr HAUKSBEE who was not aware of this difference has estimated the refractive power of the crystalline lens by forming it into a wedge by plates of glass somewhat higher than I find it to be but with his accustomed accuracy he remarked the apparent enlargement of an object occasioned by the variations of its density which he was unable to explain In the table that follows I have set down not only the limits of refractive power in a crystalline lens of an ox ascertained by trial but also an average computed from the refractive density of a dried crystalline of an ox of which the weight had been first taken in the recent state and the quantity of water lost by drying also measured 369Dr WOLLASTONS Method of examining The table exhibits a series of substances arranged according to their refractive powers That of the diamond is copied from Sir ISAAC NEWTON of other bodies to which on account of their being more dense than glass the machine for measurement would not apply the refractive powers have been found by other means for the sake of furnishing a more continued series of subjects for comparative experiments The rest have been compared by this method and their power when expressed in numbers actually measured TABLE

1O003S r r I 87 1 A Wl wDr WOLLASTONS Method of examining ON THE DISPERSION OF LIGHT The method above described for investigating refractive powers may also be employed with similar advantage for inquiries into the dispersion of light by different bodies and the consequences that result from their combined action When a glass prism is placed in contact with water and brought near the eye in such a position that it reflects the light from a window the extent of perfect reflection is seen to be bounded by a fringe of the prismatic colours in the order of their refrangibility The violet rays being in this case the most refrangible appear strongest and lowest on account of the less obliquity that is requisite for their reflection But it may happen that two media which refract unequally at the same incidence may disperse equally at that incidence Under these circumstances a pencil of rays passing from one of such media into the other will be refracted without dispersion of its colours The boundary of prismatic reflection would then be found a well defined line free from colour if the surface at which the reflected light emerges from the prism were at right angles to its course When the disparity of the dispersive powers of the media is still greater it may also happen that the usual order of pris matic colours will be reversed and then the red will appear strongest and lowest in the fringe unless the colours so pro duced are counteracted by refraction at their emergence from the prism An instance in which the colours are so reversed may be seen by application of oil of sassafras to a prism of flint glass  NEWTONs Optics Book i part 2 Exp 6 72refractive and dispersive Powers 373 So high is the dispersive power of this oil that in refractions from flint glass into it the red rays are refracted more than the violet It must be observed that in this experiment when the angle of reflection within a triangular prism exceeds 60 the angle of emergence is such as would alone occasion the red rays to appear lowermost but when the glass used is rectangular the refraction at emergence has an opposite effect any reversion of colour will therefore be in some degree corrected and may not be seen unless the dispersive power of the medium in contact much exceeds that of the glass A case of refraction with an inverted order of colours has been observed by Dr BLAIR in a compound objectglass where crownglass was in contact with oil of turpentine From trials with lenses he likewise inferred that several other fluids have the same effect when applied to that glass With this glass and also with plateglass I have tried oil of turpentine and many other fluids that afford a similar reversion of colours as linseedoil oliveoil the essential oils of berga mot lemon lavender pennyroyal and peppermint strong nitric acid and many artificial compounds that I shall presently have occasion to mention The dispersive power of fluor spar is the least of any sub stance yet examined so that although its refractive power is also remarkably low considering its great specific gravity a prism of fluor in contact with water or alcohol shows the prismatic colours to be refracted in an inverted order With heavy spar the instances of reversion are verynume rous as its dispersive power is low and is accompanied with  Edinb Trans Vol IIL MDCCCII CDr WOLLASTONS Method of examining great refractive density In the refractions from this spar into flint glass and into all oils or resins I believe without excep tion the colours are seen reversed Rock crystal likewise disperses so little that it exhibits the colours reversed when it is in contact with many substances of less refractive power than itself I have tried it with Dutch plateglass with Canada balsam and balsam of capivi with many oils essential and expressed and have found the colours in all these cases reversed By solutions of metallic salts a great variety of such appear ances may be produced Most of these compounds have a highly dispersive power and many of them may be rendered suffi ciently dense to occasion reversion even when applied to flint glass In a more dilute state they may be used with crown glass or plateglass to produce the same effect And since when further diluted by a less dispersive medium they will also present an appearance of colourless refraction we may by examining the degree of dilution necessary for that purpose compare the dispersive powers of any ingredients contained in them and may gradually extend our knowledge of this property to the elements of any bodies however compounded As a specimen of the method I have in this way compared a few solutions of metals and of other substances that were each diluted till the limit of reflection appeared void of colour when they were in contact with a rectangular piece of plateglass and in the table which follows I have expressed their refractive powers in that state of dilution as nearly as the eye can discern the disappearance of colour S074refractive and dispersive Powers TABLE II In Water  In Alcohol Nitromuriate of gold  1364 1390 Nitromuriate of platina   137 Nitrate of iron  1  75 Sulphuret of

lemon    1430 Balsam of capivi    1 440 It may here be seen that several of the metals increase the dispersive powers of nitric and muriatic acids and consequently exceed them in that respect Of all these substances that I have yet tried gold and platina are the most dispersive The least dispersive of the metals is zinc 3C 2Dr WOLLASTONS Method of examining The earths also are found to possess this property in very different degrees that of the jargon and magnesia differ but little from nitric acid in dispersive power but siliceous earth on the contrary is inferior to water By comparing the salts formed with the nitric and muriatic acids it appeared probable that the former had the higher dis persive power but a more direct comparison could not be made by means of the rectangular piece of plateglass as muriatic acid could not be rendered sufficiently dense for such a trial I therefore made use of a triangular prism of crownglass which is in itself less dispersive than any plateglass and from the relative position of its surfaces occasioned less correction of the colours With this prism I found that strong muriatic acid having a refractive power 1394 exhibited the colours reversed and that when it was diluted till the limit of reflection appeared void of colour its refractive power was reduced to 1382 But the dispersive power of nitric acid when tried by the same prismt proved to be greater for this acid required to be diluted till its refractive power did not exceed 1375 before the colour was wholly destroyed In the table it may be observed that the red and green mu riates of iron though consisting of the same metal and acid differ very much in dispersive power and consequently that some caution will be necessary in attempting to compare the different metals with each other by means of the salts contain ing them as any difference observed may be owing in part to a difference in the quantity of acid to which they are united and in part to their different proportion of oxygen A striking instance of the latter is manifest from a compa rison of sulphur with the sulphuric acid for while the former 376refractive and dispersive Powers 377 appears to exceed the metallic oxides in dispersive power the latter is inferior even to water As I have likewise at various times made many experiments on dispersion by means of wedges in a manner nearly similar to that employed by Mr DOLLOND Dr BLAIR and others I have endeavoured to reduce the several substances thus exa mined to one table but as the limits of colour are in few in stances sufficiently well defined for accurate mensuration I have not attempted to add any numerical estimate of their powers but have merely ascertained the order in which they succeed each other and in the following table have arranged them according to the excess of their effect on violet above red light at a given angle of deviation TABLE III Order of dispersive Refr Power Powers Sulphur   204 Glass of lead  sand 1987

1495 1768 1433 I  J378 Dr WOLLASTONS Method of examining By comparison of this table with the order of refractive powers as contained in the first table it will be seen how little correspondence there is between them and accordingly how numerous are the combinations by means of which a pencil of rays that passes through two media may be made to deviate without dispersion of its colours I cannot conclude these observations on dispersion without remarking that the colours into which a beam of white light is separable by refraction appear to me to be neither 7 as they usually are seen in the rainbow nor reducible by any means that I can find to g as some persons have conceived but that by employing a very narrow pencil of light 4 primary divisions of the prismatic spectrum may be seen with a degree of distinctness that I believe has not been described nor ob served before If a beam of daylight be admitted into a dark room by a crevice 2 of an inch broad and received by the eye at the distance of o1 or 12 feet through a prism of flintglass free from veins held near the eye the beam is seen to be separated into the four following colours only red yellowish green blue and violet in the proportions represented in Fig 3 The line A that bounds the red side of the spectrum is somewhat confused which seems in part owing to want of power in the eye to converge red light The line B between red and green in a certain position of the prism is perfectly distinct so also are D and E the two limits of violet But C the limit of green and blue is not so clearly marked as the rest and there are also on each side of this limit other distinct dark lines f and g either of which in an imperfect experi maent might be mistaken for the boundary of these coloursrefractive and dispersive Powers 379 The position of the prism in which the colours are most clearly divided is when the incident light makes about equal angles with two of its sides I then found that the spaces AB BC CD DE occupied by them were nearly as the numbers 16 23 36 25 Since the proportions of these colours to each other have been supposed by Dr BLAIR to vary according to the medium by which they are produced I have compared with this appearance the coloured images caused by prismatic vessels containing sub stances supposed by him to differ most in this respect such as strong but colourless nitric acid rectified oil of turpentine very pale oil of sassafras and Canada balsam also nearly colour less With each of these I have found the same arrangement of these 4 colours and in similar positions of the prisms as nearly as I could judge the same proportions of them But when the inclination of any prism is altered so as to increase the dispersion of the colours the proportions of them to each other are then also changed so that the spaces AC and CE instead of being as before 39 and 61 may be found altered as far as 4o and 58  Although what I have above described comprises the whole of the prismatic spectrum that can be rendered visible there also pass on each side of it other rays whereof the eye is not sensible From Dr HE Rs H E L experiments Phil Trans for 1800 we learn that on one side there are invisible rays occasioning heat that are less refrangible than red light and on thie other I have myself observed and the same remark has been made by Mr RITTER that there are likewise invisible rays of another kind that are more refracted than the violet It is by their chemical effects alone that the existence of these can be discovered and by far the most delicate test of their presence is the white muriate of silver To SCHEELE among many valuable discoveries we are indebted for having first duly distinguished between radiant heat and light Traite de lAir et du Feu  56 57  and to him also we owe the observation that wheh muriate of silver is exposedDr WOLLASTONS Method of examining c By candlelight a different set of appearances may be dis tinguished When a very narrow line of the blue light at the lower part of the flame is examined alone in the same manner through a prism the spectrum instead of appearing a series of lights of different hues contiguous may be seen divided into 5 images at a distance from each other The ist is broad red terminated by a bright line of yellow the 2d and 3d are both green the 4th and 5th are blue the last of which appears to correspond with the division of blue and violet in the solar spectrum or the line D of Fig 3 When the object viewed is a blue line of electric light I have found the spectrum to be also separated into several images but the phenomena are somewhat different from the preceding It is however needless to describe minutely appearances which vary according to the brilliancy of the light and which I cannot undertake to explain to the common prismatic spectrum it is blackened more in the violet than in any other kind of light  66 In repeating this experiment I found that the blackness ex tendednot only through the space occupied by the violet but to an equal degree and to about an equal distance beyond the visible spectrum and that by narrowing the pencil of light received on the prism the discoloration may be made to fall almost entirely beyond the violet It would appear therefore that this and other effects usually attributed to light are not in fact owing to any of the rays usually peceived but to invisible rays that accompany them and that if we include two kinds that are invisible we may distin guish upon the whole six species of rays into which a sunbeam is divisible by refraction 38oc      D     L r r    V I Ib  z f X  Z i Z I I 0 y   SIX91411It  O X Xltlz  2M

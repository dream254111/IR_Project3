Exposed to Severe Strains,i207005, 677  XXXV An Experimental Inquiry into the Strength of WroughtIron Plates and their Riveted Joints as applied to Ship building and Vessels exposed to severe strains By WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN Esq Commnunicated by the Rev HENRY MOSELEY FRS Received April 25Read June 13 1850 TIE experiments herein recorded were institutedI early in the spring of 1838 and before the close of the following winter most of them had been completed owing however to a long series of professional engagements they have stood over with the exception of some additions made in the following year to the present time The object of the inquiry was twofoldfirst to ascertain by direct experiment the strength of wroughtiron plates and their riveted joints in their application as materials for shipbuilding and secondly to determine their relative value when used as a sub stitute for wood On these two points it cannot be expected that our knowledge should be far advanced as a very few years have elapsed since it was asserted that iron from its high specific gravity was not calculated for such a purpose and that the greatest risk was likely to be incurred in attempting to construct vessels of what was then considered a doubtful material Time has however proved the fallacy of these views and I hope in the following expeiriments to show that the iron ship when properly constructed is not only more buovant but safer and more durable than vessels built of the strongest English oak At the cominencetmet of the experiments I felt desirous of conducting them upon a scale of such magnitude as would supply sound practical data and at the same time establish a series of results calculated to ensure confidence as well as economy in the use of the material My views were ably carried out by Mr HoDGKINSON who conducted the experiments under rily direction and from whom I received valuable assistance In conducting the investigation I found it necessary to divide the subject into four distinct parts 1st The strength of plates when torn asunder by a direct tensile strain in the direction of the fibre and when torn asunder across it 2ndlv On the strength of the Joints of plates when united by rivets as compared xwith the plates thermselves 3rdly On the resistance of plates to the force of compression whether applied by a dead wveilit or by imptact678 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY And lastly On the strength and value of wroughtiron frames and ribs as applied to ships and other vessels PART I At the commencement of iron shipb uilding in which I took an active part the absence of acknowledged facts relative to Bthe strength and varied conditions under which the material was applied was the principal reason which induced me to enter upon this inquiry I have extended the investigation into the best methods of rivet ing and the proportional strength of rivets joints c as compared with the plates and the uses for which they are intended The latter is a practical and highly im portant inquiry as great difference of opinion exists amongst engineers and others as to the form strength and proportions of rivets and the joints of which they form an essential part I therefore considered an experimental investigation much wanted not only on account of its important practical bearing but what was probably of equal value in order to remove existing discrepancies and to establish a sounder principle of construction founded upon the unerring basis of experiment From these considerations I bestowed increased attention upon the inquiry and endeavoured to render it practically useful Before detailing the experiments it may be necessary to describe the apparatus by which the results were obtained The annexed drawings Plate LIV represent a side and end view of the apparatus used in the experiments The large lever A was made of malleable iron and was fixed to the lower cross beam B fig 1 by a strong bolt 0 which passed through it at B At the top end of this bolt a preparation was made to receive the end of the lever and by means of the screwnut at a the lever A was raised or lowered to suit the length of the plates to be experimented upon Upon the top side of the beam and under the gable wall of a building five stories high were placed two castiron columns D D which retained the beam B in its place and prevented it from rising when the lever was heavily loaded during the experiment The frame E guided the end of the lever and the weight W and close to the fulcrum were placed two wooden standards  Several important facts and improvements in the construction of iron ships have been ascertained since my experiments were made but I apprehend none of them have tended in the least degree to diminish their value Nor have they to the best of my knowledge been superseded by others of a more elaborate or more decisive character It is true that a series of interesting and important experiments have been made at the instance of the Admiralty on the effect of shot upon the sides of iron ships At some of these experiments I had the honour to be present and witnessed some curious and unexpected results The first series was conducted at the Arsenal Woolwich and subsequently others were made at Portsmouth Both were important as respects the effect of shot upon wroughtiron plates with enlarged and diminished charges of powder and at different velocities but discouraging as regards the use of iron in the construction of ships of war These experiments however interesting in themselves do not appear to be conclusive and it is to be hoped that the apparent danger indicated by the experiments may yet be overcome and the superiority as well as the greater security of the iron ship fully establishedZz 5 D CCCL l97lo

suspended These plates were nearly all of the same form as shown at H and were made narrower in the middle to ensure fracture in that part the ends as at b 6 had plates riveted to them on both sides in order to strengthen them at those parts when attached to the bolts and shackle under strain The specimens thus prepared were suspended by the cross bolts i i and resting upon the standards were torn asunder by weights suspended from the large beam as exhibited in the Plate In addition to the large weight W a strong scale was attached to the extreme end of the lever at I for the purpose of increasing the weights when required in the larger description of experiments and by the application of a pair of blocks and the windlass K the load was removed and the changes produced upon the

Taking therefore the results as derived from these experiments it will be observed that in every instance little or no difference appears to exist in the resisting powers of plates whether drawn in the direction of the fibre or across it This fact is clearly established by the following comparison which evidently shows that in whatever direction the plates are torn asunder their strenlgthx is nearly the sameINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 683 Mean breaking Mean breaking weight in the direc weight across the tion of the fibre in fibre in tons per tons per square inch square inch

in one direc tion as in the other and it is not improbable that the same property would be exhi bited and the same resistance maintained if the plates were drawn in any particular direction obliquely across their fibrous or laminated structure In order however to establish the relative powers of resistance in plates of rolled iron I have endeavoured to tabulate the results as derived frorn the preceding expe riments in such form as will indicate their respective values and place them in com parison with each other and also with those made on bars by TELFORD and BROWN The comparisons are made from the Yorkshire plates as producing the best results and conceiving them to be a fair average of the strength of rolled iron I have selected them as the standard of comparison Comparative

rough bars before rolling may however account for the difference and in a great measure determines the strength of the plate In this country the process of piling is by equal layers of flat bars at right angles to each other which produces great uniformity of strength and texture in the manufacture At other places there is sometimes a difference in the mode of piling which varies the texture of the plate and also the strength of the layers are greater in one direction than another 4s2684 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY Here it will be observed that the difference between the strength of the Low Moor plates in their resistance to a tensile strain when compared with bar iron is incon siderable but taking the mean of the other irons viz the Derbyshire Shropshire and Staffordshire there is a falling off in the strength of about 21 per cent the ratio being in favour of bar iron as 1 035 8209 In treating of the strength of iron it may be useful to compare the foregoing expe riments on the tensile strength of plates with those of a similar description on timber On this subject I feel the more desirous of establishing a comparison as the two kinds of material are now applied to similar purposes such as shipbuilding and other con structions and the question becomes every day more important as to which of the two materials is the best There is every reason to believe that the advocates of improve ment would arrange themselves on the side of iron and those for the c wooden walls would be equally zealous on that of timber This is however a question which time and experience alone can determine and conceiving that our knowledge of the pro perties of iron as a material for shipbuilding is far from perfect we may safely leave its final decision to the evidence of experimental research and a more extended ap plication of its practical results When we attempt a comparison of the value of one material in its application to a specific purpose with that of another material similarly applied the comparison is only correct when the two materials are placed in juxtaposition Or when they are contrasted under the same circumstances as to the trials and tests to which they are respectively subjected Now in this comparison I am fortunate in having before me the able ex perinments of MUSSCHENBROCK BUFFON and those of a mnore recent date on direct co hesion by Professor BARLOW of Woolwich Ithave selected from the experiments of the latter those which appear to approach most nearly to the present inquiry and impressed with the conviction of their having been carefully conducted and being from English timber I attach the greatest value to them According to MusscHENBRocKs the strengths of direct cohesion per square inch of the following kinds of timber are as follows lbs Locusttree    20100 Locusttree   18500 Beech and oak    17300 Orange   15500 Alder   13900 Elm  3200 Mulberry 12500 Willow 12500 Ash  12500 Plum   11800 Elder 10000 lbs Pomegranate 9750

20000 Beech 11500 Ash   17000 Oak  10000 Teak  15000 Pear  9800 Fir 12000 Mahogany 8000 Mr BARLOW in adverting to the experiments of MUSSCHENBROCK observes that some of them differ considerably from his own a circumstance probably not difficult to account for as the different degrees of dryness have a great effect upon the strength of timber Dr ROBISON in speaking of the experiments of MUSSCHENBROCK states that we may presume they were carefully made and faithfully narrated but they were made on such small specimens that the unavoidable natural inequalities of growth or tex ture produced irregularities in the results wbich have too great a proportion to the whole quantities observed It is for the same reason that I give preference to Mr BARLOwS results as he observes that the experiments from which they are drawn were made with every possible care the delicacy of the operation would admit Assuming therefore that BARLOW is correct and taking the mean strength of iron plates as given in the preceding Tables at 49656 lbs to the square inch or calling it 50000 lbs and the resistance of the direct cohesion of different kinds of timber as given by Mr BARLOW the following ratio of strengths will be obtained Timber Iron Ratio taking lbs lbs timber as unity Ash      17000 50000 or as I  294 Teak  15000 50000 or as 1 333 Fir  12000 50000 or as I 416 Beech  11500 50000 or as 1 434 Oak 10000 50000 or as 1 5 00 Hence it appears that the direct cohesion of iron plates is five times greater than oak or in other words their powers of resistance to a force applied to tear them asunder is as 5 to 1 making an iron plate  inch thick equal to an oak plank of 22 inches thick In the teak wood and fir specimnens which exhibit greater resisting powers nearly the same rule will apply and thinner planks as regards the tensile strength would answer the purpose This its a circumstance which may be appli cable to teak wood but unfavourable to fir when viewed as a building material ex posed to a great variety of strains or when used for sheathing and similar purposes in the art of shipbuilding The teak wood being timber of greater density and of  It has been shown by Mr HODGKINSON that timber when wet will be crushed by a force less than one half of what would take to crush it when dry It therefore follows that much depends upon the samples selected and the way in which the timber has been seasoned6 18MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY higher specific gravity is better calculated to resist shocks than a tough fibrous substance of a soft and spongy nature such as fir On this subject it should however be noticed that whatever material is used for covering the ribs of vessels it should be strong and elastic in order to resist not only the force of direct tension but that of lateral and compressed action In a ship at sea these forces are strikingly exemplified and that under circumstances embar rassing as well to the practical builder as the man of science Remarks on theforegotng ezperiments Having determined the strength of iron plates when drawn in the direction of the fibre as well as across it and having compared the results with experiments of a similar character on timber it may be useful to offer a few general observations on the question now under consideration Dr RoBINSON in his article on the strength of materials when discussing the na ture of a stretching force applied to materials observes  that in pulling a body asunder the force of cohesion is directly opposed with very little imodification of its action that all parts are equally stretched and the strain in every transverse sec tion is the same in every part of that section From this it would appear that a body of a homogeneous texture will have the cohesion of its parts equal and since every part is equally stretched it follows that the particles will be drawn to equal distances and the forces thus exerted must be equal Now if this were true the ap plication of an external force to a body might be increased to such an extent as not only to separate the parts furthest asunder but ultimately to destroy the cohesion of all the particles at once a circumstance under which instantaneous rupture would follow as a result These views are however not borne out by facts as the experi ments of Mr HODGKmINSON on iron wire show that the same iron may be torn asun der many times in succession without impairing its strengthf and some recent expe riments at the Royal Dockyard Woolwich clearly show that an iron bar may be stretched until its transverse section is considerably reduced and ultimately broken without injury to its tensile strength Nay more the same iron so elongated when again submitted to experiment exhibited increased strength and continued to in crease under certain limitations beyond the bearing powers of the same bar in its original formt That all the parts of a body  subjected to a tensile strain are equally stretched  is therefore questionable Bodies vary considerably in their powers of re sistance and exhibit peculiar properties of cohesion under the influence of forces cal culated to tear them asunder Fibrous substances for instance such as ropes and sonic kinds of tingber having their fibres twisted are enabled to resist tension under the influence of considerable elongation without impairing their ultimate strength  Encyclopvedia Britannica t Manchester Memoirs vol v  I am indebted to Mr THoMAs LOYD of the Admiralty for a series of interesting results on this subject See AppendixINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 687 Many of the fibres are stretched but only to the extent of bringing the others to bear upon the load which done their united force constitutes the maximum of resistance to a tensile strain Other bodies of less ductility and more of a crystalline structure such as cast iron stone glass c seem to be subject to the same law In these cases it seldom happens that the whole of the particles are brought into action at once as much depends upon the conditions of the body the unequal state of tension of its parts and the strain which some of the particles must sustain before the others receive their due portion of the load Should the nonresisting particles be within the limits of elongation of the other particles the body will then have attained its maximum power of resistance but in the event of rupture to any of the resisting particles the cohesive force of the body is thereby reduced and that to the extent of the injury sustained by the frac tured parts There are however as Dr RoBINSON truly observes immense varieties in the structure and composition of bodies which lead to important facts and prove that the absolute cohesion of all bodies whatever be their texture is proportional to the areas of their sections Undoubtedly this is the case in bodies having an uniform texture with straight fibres and hence it follows that the absolute strength of a body resisting a tensile strain will be as the area of its section The peculiar nature of the material combining a crystalline as well as a fibrous structure has led to these observations In some instances the specimens experi mented upon exhibited an almost distinct fibrous texture and in others a clearly de veloped crystalline structure At other times some of the specimens were of a mixed kind with the crystalline and fibrous forms united the fracture having a laminated appearance with the crystalline parts closely bound on each side by layers of the fibrous structure These varieties are probably produced in the manufacture and may be easily effected either by the mode of piling  the layers of bars which form the plate or from the unequal temperature of the parts as they pass through the rolls But whichever way they are produced it is evident from the experiments that the fractures gave in most cases indications of an unequal and varied texture In the foregoing experiments and also in those which follow great attention was paid to the appearance of the fracture in order to ascertain the structure of the plate and to determine how far it could be depended upon in its application to the varied purposes for which it was intended These appearances are all shown in the drawings appended to the experiments and to which I beg to refer  See the fractured parts of the different specimens Plate LV688 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY PART IL Ott the Strength of Iron Plates united by 1Rivets and the best mode of Riveting The extensive and almost innumerable uses to which iron is applied constitute one of the most important features in the improvements of civilized life It con tributes to the domestic comforts and commercial greatness of the country and from its cheapness strength and power of being moulded rolled and forged into almost every shape it is not only the strongest but in many respects the most eligible mate rial for the construction of vessels exposed to severe strain Large vessels composed of iron plates such as steamboilers cisterns ships c cannot however be formed upon the anvil or the rollingmill They are constructed of many pieces and these pieces have to be joined together in such a manner as to ensure the requisite strength and effect all the requirements of sound construction This operation is called rivet ing and although practically understood it has not to my knowledge on any previous occasion received that attention which the importance of the subject demands Up to the present time nothing of consequence has been done to improve or enhance the value of this process We possess no facts or experiments calculated to establish principles sufficient to guide our operations in effecting constructions of this kind on which the lives of the public as well as the property of individuals depend In fact such has been our ignorance of the relative strength of plates and their riveted joints that until the commencement of the present inquiry the subject was considered of scarcely sufficient importance to merit attention Even now it is by many assumed that a wellriveted joint is stronger than the plate itself and a number of persons judging from appearances alone concur in that opinion Now this is a great mistake and although the double thickness of the joint indicates increased strength it is nevertheless much weaker than the solid plate a circumstance of some importance as we hope to show in the following experiments It would probably be superfluous to offer any lengthened description of the prin ciple upon which wroughtiron plates are united together riveting is so familiar to every person in this country that it might appear a work of supererogation to at tempt it and assuming that the usual method of riveting by hammers to be gene rally known we shall proceed to describe another method by machinery which effects the same object in considerably less time and at less cost and completes the union of the plates with much greater perfection than could possibly be done by the hand In hand riveting it will be observed that the tightness of the joint and the soundness of the work depends upon the skill and also upon the will of the work nan or those who undertake to formn the joint and close the rivets In the mnachineriveting neither the will nor the hand of man has anything to do w ith it the

machine over the handriveting The machine produces much sounder work as the time occupied in the hand process allows the rivet to cool and thus by destroying its ductility the rivet is imperfectly closed and hence follow the defects of leaky rivets and imperfect joints It is evident that an instrument such as the rivetingmachine having sufficient force to compress the rivet at once or within an almost infinitely short period of time must obviate if not entirely remedy these evils as the force of compression being nearly instantaneous the heads on both sides cannot be formed until the body of the rivet is squeezed tight into the hole and in every case even where the holes are not exactly straight the compressed rivets are never loose but fill the holes with the same degree of tightness as if placed directly opposite to each other If for example we take a circular boiler such as represented at A Plate LVI fig 3 and having all the perforations made and the plates attached to each other by temporary bolts and suspended over the machine in the position as shown at A and having brought the holes in a line with the die marked i k the machine then is set to work and by means of the cam or excentric raising the pulley of the elbowjoint Ctlhe die k is advanced against the fixed die i in the wroughtiron stem and the rivet is compressed into the required form with an increasing force as the die advances which gives the nip or greatest pressure at the required time namely at the closing of the rivet From this description it will appear that a very limited portion of time is occupied in the process and as twelve rivets can be inserted and finished bv the machine in a minute it follows from the rapidity of the operation and the absence of hammering that the ductility of the rivets is retained and their subsequent contraction upon the plate renders the joint perfectly tight and the rivets sound in every respect Under all the circumstances the machineriveting is preferable to that executed by the hammer  it saves much time and labour and that in proportion of 12 to I  when com pared to a long series of impacts applied by the hammer Having described the process of uniting wroughtiron plates by rivets it may be of some importance to know the value of joints thus formed as regards their strength when compared with the plates themselves To attain this object and satisfactorily to determine their powers of resistance to a tensile strain a great variety of joints were made and having prepated the different specimens with the utmost care and attention they were submitted to the test of experiment as follows   The plan represents the machine in the act of riveting the corners of a square cistern or a locomotive fire box MIDCCCL 4 T690 MR FAIRJAIINS

WROUGHTIRON PLATES 691 found necessary as the metal gave indications of weakness in consequence of the lap being rather narrow Another reason for enlarging the lap was a desire at the corn mencement to begin with the least possible quantity and by direct experiment to ascertain the maximum distance which the plates should overlap each other in the joints and to determine the strongest and best form of uniting them To these points every attention was given for the purpose of collecting the facts on which are founded the tabulated results on that part of the subject which treats of the comparative dimen sions of rivets and extent of the lap in reference to the thickness of the plates In this department of the inquiry will be found the depth of lap diameter and length of rivets and the distances of holes for nearly every description of joint also the thickness of the plate with a column of strengths as deduced from the experiments If we examine the nature of the fracture in the foregoing experiments it will be found that the machineriveting is superior to that done by the hamnmer the mean of the three first experiments being to the mean of the fourth and fifth as 5  4 In the eighth and ninth the strengths are nearly the same On comparing the strength of plates with their riveted joints it will be necessary to examine the sectional areas taken in a line through the rivetholes with the section of the plates themselves It is perfectly obvious that in perforating a line of holes along the edge of a plate we must reduce its strength and it is also clear that the plate so perforated will be to the plate itself nearly as the areas of their respective sections with a small deduction for the irregularities of the pressure of the rivets upon the plate or in other words the joint will be reduced in strength somewhat more than the ratio of its section through that line to the solid section of the plate For example suppose two plates each 2 feet wide and threeeighths of an inch thick to be riveted together with ten A inch rivets It is evident that out of 2 feet the length of thle joint the strength of the plates is reduced by perforation to the extent of 71 inches and here the strength of the plates will be to that of the joint as 9 61875 which is nearly the same as the respective areas of the solid plate and that through the rivetholes namely as 24  165 From these facts it is evident that the rivets cannot add to the strength of the plates their object being to keep the two surfaces of the lap in contact and being headed on both sides the plates are brought into very close union by the contraction or cooling of the rivets after they are closed It may be said that the pressure or adhesion of the two surfaces of the plates would add to the strength but this is not found to be the case to any great extent as in almost every instance the experiments indicate the resistance to be in the ratio of their sectional areas or nearly so If we take the ultimate strength of the Yorkshire plates in Tables I and II it will be found that the mean breaking weight of eight specimens each with a sectional area of 46 inch is 26168 and the strength of the single joint of the same descrip tion of plates with an area of A44 inch is 18591  this reduced gives the ratio of the  I use the term single joint to distinguish it from the double riveted

line of the rivets It will be observed that in this comparison the areas of the sections are nearly equal and consequently there is a difference in strength between the solid part of the plate and that part where the perforations have been made of 32 per cent The difference is considerable but it probably arises from the narrowness of the specimen and the lateral strain induced by the position of the rivet and the bending upwards of the end of the plates From these facts I would infer that single riveting is weaker and probably the loss of strength in this description of joint including loss caused by the rivetholes is not less under ordinary circumstances than 40 per cent TABLE VII Strength of riveted Plates NotPeserip on of plates V ei liht Chang pduced by Breaking Form of specimen

plates During the whole of the experiments on single riveted joints it was observed that the ends of the plates under strain curled upwards on each side and produced a dia gonal strain upon the plates which materially reduced the strength of the joint as shown at a fig 7 This position gave an oblique direction to the forces and caused the plate to break in some degree transversely through the rivetholes In order to obviate this defect and prevent as much as possible a transverse strain upon the plates through the  Subsequent experiments made for ascertaining the strength of rivets vide experiments on the strength of rivets for the Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges fully corroborate these views namely that riveted joints exposed to a tensile strain are directly or nearly so as

VIII represent the form of joint and the methods adopted for securing the plates in the direct line of the strain On comparing the breakinv weights it will be seen that the increased lap with a rivet

THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIIRON PLATES 695 The system of double riveting exhibits several remarkable properties as regards strength and the plates appear to retain their position under strain much better than singleriveted joints These circumstances have induced a comparison of the results of the preceding experiments with those contained in Tables VII VIII IX and X The experiments in rables VII and VIII give indications of increased strength by a slight enlargement of the lap and the introduction of a single rivet to keep down the end of the plate In those experiments it was found that the additional rivet gave an increase of 26 per cent over those obtained from the single rivets a circumstance which suggested a further extension of the experiments accompanied with a minute investigation of the parts in order to ascertain their relative strengths and the strongest form of joint The mean breaking weights of equal sections of singleriveted joints as given in Table VI and taken from nine experiments are respectively as follows 251271 16107 Mean  18590 18982 19147 giving a mean of 18590 lbs for the strength of singleriveted joints Now in the second and third experiments Table VII with the rivets inserted in the shape of an isosceles triangle which in fact is double riveting and of equal sections to the speci mens in Table VI the mean breaking weight is 23035 which gives an excess of 4445 or a ratio of 10 8 in favour of the experiments recorded in Table VII In the experiments Table X the area of the section taken through the line of the rivetholes is 44 inch or precisely equal to the section of the specimens experimented upon in Table VI in which the mean breaking weight is 18590 lbs In these expe riments the breaking weight is 23707 lbs which is rather more than that in Table IX where the material had a smaller section but having its dimensions exactly corre sponding with the proportions given above It therefore follows that in plates jointed with single rivets the ratio of the strength of the single rivets is to that of the double riveted joints as 8 to 10 the latter bein onefourth stronger It has been ascertained that it required a weight of 23707 lbs to tear asunder doubleriveted plates 31 inches wide and 22 inches thick with a flush joint having a plate on the back and held together by five iinch rivets on each side the quantity of metal between the holes in a direct line across the plate being 2 X 22A44 inch which is the same transverse section as those operated upon in the first Table Now if we take the mean breaking weights of the riveted joints in Tables X and VI and compare them with the section of the plate itself as given in Table I the areas being the samve we have for the tensile strength of plates Section of iron torn

comparative values of jointed plates of equal sections when acted upon by a force calculated to tear them asunder The correct value of the plates computed from a sectional area taken through the rivetholes will therefore be to their riveted joints as 100 93 and 73 or in round numbers as 10 9 and 7 In addition to a loss of nearly onetenth in the doubleriveted joints and three tenths in the single ones it will be observed that the strength of the plates is still further reduced by the quantity of iron punched out for the rivets TABLE XI Single riveted Plates No Description of plates

When the comparative merits of plates and their riveted joints were under consi deration it appeared desirable to repeat several of the experiments particularly those which seemed to throw light upon their relative powers of resistance I considered these experiments to be of importance as they increased our knowledge as respects the strength of the material and also its properties in combination In shipbuilding these objects are of sorte value as any reduction in the powers or parts of a vessel by imperfect construction or misapplied material might lead to serious error and even great risk to the safety of the ship Since the first use of iron for these objects it has been the practice to countersink the heads of the rivets in order to present a smnooth surface for the passage of the vessel throng h the water This pralctice is in general use at my vorks at Millwall and I believe the salme methlods are pursued at the establishmtlent Of Messrs JOHN LAIRD and Co and others in dfifferent parts of the country The introduction of this system of riveting caused a ftirther extension of the experiments in order to elucidate the various forms of joints given in the preceding TRables and further to investigate the strength of the joint with a plate riveted on eaich side which appears to be the strongest and best calculated to resist a tensile strain riThis description of joint is seldom used in shipbulilding but in order to render the expcriments as perfect as MIDCCCLF4698 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY possible it will be necessary to consider it in this paper with others of equal import ance and probably of more general use The system of countersinking the rivets is only used when smooth surfaces are re quired under other circumstances their introduction would not be desirable as they do not add to the strength of the joint but to a certain extent reduce it This re duction is not observable in the experiments but the simple fact of sinking the head of the rivet into the plate and cutting out a greater portion of metal must of necessity lessen its strength and render it weaker than the plain joint with raised heads This must appear evident from the fact of the sectional area of the plate being diminished and the consequent reduction of the heads of the rivets which in this state are less able to sustain the effects of an oblique or transverse strain It is however satisfactory to observe that countersinking the heads of the rivets does not seriously injure the joint in its powers of resistance to a direct tensile force but the rivets are liable to start when exposed to collisions or a strong impinging force such as the sides of ships are frequently doomed to encounter On referring to experiments Table XI the same results as to strength are ob tained with the countersunk rivets as those with rounded heads they are rather under the mean of the former experiments but not more than is easily accounted for by the reduced section of the countersunk plates The joint with plates riveted on each side is seldom used a circumstance which probably arises from its greater complexity of form and the danger which a treble thickness of plate would be subject to if used in boilers or vessels exposed to the ac tion of intense heat It is also inadmissible in shipbuilding as the smooth surface requires to be maintained and the greatest care observed in the formation of the outer sheathing to lessen the resistance of every part of the hull immersed in the water In other respects the doubleriveted plate is a strong joint and in every case where great strength is required it may be used with perfect safety It will be unnecessary to go through a further comparison of the experiments as sufficient data have already been furnished to enable us to calculate the force per square inch and to resolve the whole into a general summary exhibiting the relative strengthslst of the plates 2ndly of the single and doubleriveted joints and lastly the ratio of the strengths as deduced from the whole series of experimentsINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 699 General summary of Results as obtained from the foregoing Experiments

Singleriveted joint  791 From the above it will be seen that the singleriveted joints have lost onefifth of the actual strength of the plates whilst the doubleriveted have retained their resist ing powers unimpaired These are important and convincing proofs of the superior value of the double joint and in all cases where strength is required this description of joint should never be omitted On referring to the experiments contained in the separate tables there will be found a striking coincidence in the facts tending to establish the principle of double riveting as superior in every respect to the general practice now in use of the single rivets It appears when plates are riveted in this manner that the strength of the joints is to the strength of the plates of equal sections of metal as the numbers 1000 1021 and 791  In a former analysis it was 1000 933 and 731 which gives us a mean of 1000 977 and 761 which in practice we may safely assume as the correct value of each Exclusive of this difference we must however deduct 30 per cent for the loss of metal actually punched out for the reception of the rivets and the absolute strength of the plates will then be to that of the riveted joints as the numbers 100 68 and 46 In some cases where the rivets are wider apart the loss sustained is however not so great  The cause of the increase of strength in the doubleriveted plates may be attributed to the riveted speci mens being made from the best iron whereas the mean strength of the plates is taken from all the irons expe rimented upon some of inferior quality which will account for the high value of the doubleriveted joint In ordinary cases and in practice it will therefore be safer to take the mean of the whole viz Strength of plates   100 Strength of doubleriveting  97 And of singleriveting  76 4 U2700 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY but in boilers and similar vessels where the rivets require to be close to each other the edges of the plates are weakened tothat extent In this estimate we must however take into consideration the circumstances under which the results weie obtained as only two or three rivets came within the reach of experiment and again looking at the increase of strength which might be gained by having a greater number of rivets in combination and the adhesion of the two surfaces of the plates in contact which in the compressed rivets by machine is considerable we may fairly assume the follow ing relative strengths as the value of plates with their riveted joints Taking the strength of the plate at 100 The strength of the doubleriveted joint would then be  70 And the strength of the singleriveted joint  56 These proportions may therefore in practice be safely taken as nearly the standard value of joints such as used in vessels where they are required to be steam or water tight and subjected to pressure varying from 10 to 100 lbs upon the square inch Since the above was written I have ascertained on a recent visit to Bristol that the large steamnship now building there is doubleriveted the plates being threefourths of an inch thick over the bottom and bilge and fiveeighths thick up to the water line These plates are joined together with double rivets of 1 inch diameter and in serted at distances of 3 inches apart The proportions appear to be good and con ceiving the workmanship to be equally so I should infer that this fine vessel would fairly establish the principle that iton in all the ramifications of shipbuilding is an article of paramount importance to the wai as well as to the mercantile navy In the pursuit of the foregoing inquiry I was naturally led to the consideration of the best proportions and Iest forms of riveting plates together I investigated this subject with great care and from my own personal knowledge and that of others I have collected a number of practical fracts such as long experience alone could furnish From these data I have been enabled to complete the following Table

necessary to form the strongest steam or watertight joints on plates threeeighths of an inch thick In the preceding pages I have endeavoured to investigate almost every circumn stance having a practical bearing on the question of the strength of rolled plates and the best methods of uniting them together In conclusion I would venture a few remarks on the value and judicious use of this material in its adaptation to ship building and other purposes to which it may be successfully applied It is not my intention to enter into the question as to whether wood or iron be the preferable material as a number of circumstances such as cost durability c must be con sidered in order to form a correct decision I would however observe that in shipbuilding alone it appears from the facts already recorded that iron is very superior in its powers of resistance to strain it is highly ductile in its character and easily moulded into any required form without impairing its strength It is also stronger in combination than timber arising from the nature of the construction and the materials composing the itron ship become a homogeneous mass when united together forming as it were a solid without joints and presenting as a whole the most formidable powers of resistance These are some of the properties which appear to distinguish iron from other materials and which give it an ascendenev of com inbined action which cannot be obtained in the union of timber however ingeniously cont rived It moreover possesses the property of lightness along with strength  in fact its buoyancy strength and durability con stitute the elements of its utility in the innumerable cases to which it may be applied In shipbuilding it possesses other advantages over timber Its hull is flee frotm the  Since the above was written we have had many examples of the enormous strength of iron ships and amongst others we may instance an iron vessel which took the ground with nearly onehalf of her length at the stern hanging over a shelf for a whole tide another the Vanguard iron steamer which for several hours under the action of a heavy surf was beating upon sharp shelving rocks without going to pieces and lastly the Great Britain steamship which was stranded in Dundrum Bay and resisted the force of the winter storms for mnany mnonths702 MR FAIHBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY risk of fire and in case of shipwreck either on rocks or sandbanks it will resist the heaviest sea endure the severest concussion and with proper attention to the construction it may be the means of saving the lives of all on board It moreover has the advantage of bulkheads which made perfectly watertight not only strengthen the vessel but give greater security to it and by a judicious arrangement in the divisions will float the ship under the adverse circumstance of a leak occurring in any one of the compartments These are the qualities and powers of the iron ship and I trust the present research into the strength and proportions of the material of which it is composed will not only give increased confidence in its security but will lead to an extension of its application in every branch of marine and mechanical archi tecture PART HI Resistance of Wroughtiron Plates to Pressure by a Blunt Instrument at right angles to the surface of the Plate Irrespective of the experiments made to determine the strength of wroughbtiron plates and the relative strength of the joints by which they are united the investiga tion would be incomplete if we omitted another inquiry of equal importance namely the resistance offered by plates to a crushing force such as exhibited in the injuries received by vessels when stranded on rocks or taking the ground in harbours where the surfaces are uneven Almost every person connected with nautical affairs is acquainted with the nature of the injuries received by timberbuilt vessels when placed in circumstances affect ing their stability or when resting on hard and unequal ground such as frequently occurs in tidal harbours at low water Such a position is attended with danger under every circumstance and in order to determine the relative values of the two mate rials wood and iron it was considered desirable to institute a similar class of experi mnents on both and thus to afford the means of comparison between then English oak as the strongest and best material used for the construction of first class vessels was selected for this purpose and the results obtained from both are given under circumstances as nearly similar as the nature of the experiment would admit They are as follows In each of the experiments the plate las fastened upon a firame of cast iron 1 foot square inside and 1 foot 6 inches outside its breadth being 3 inches and thickness half an inch The sides of the plates when hot were twisted round the frame to which they were firmly bolted The contraction by cooling caused it to be very tight and the force to burst it was applied in the centre This was done in order that the force mi rht in some degree resemble that from a stone or other body with a blunt end pressing against the side or bottom of a vessel a bolt of iron terminating in a hemispheire 3 inches in diameter had thus its rounded end pressed perpen dicularly to the plate in the middle Thle results are given inl the following Tables1

follow the ratio of the squares of the depth so that a wroughtiron plate of only onequarter of an inch thick is able to resist a force equal to that required in the rupture of a 3inch plank The experiments were made upon good English oak of different thicknesses and of the same width as the iron plates The specimens were laid upon solid planks 12 inches asunder and by the same apparatus the rounded end of the 3inch pin was forced through them as follows704 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY Resistance of planks of timber to the entrance of a ball 3 inches diameter the planks being laid

square of the depth as is found to be the case in the transverse fracture of rectangular bodies of constant breadth and span If we compare the foregoing results with the experiments performed by Mr lIODG KINSON on timber it will be found that the strength of drv English oak to resist a crushing force is 4 24 tons to the square inch whereas wrought iron according to RONDFLET requires a pressurie of about 31 tons per square inch and with thiss weight it is reduced about onesixteenth of its length The resistauce of wrought iron to a crushing force is therefore about seven and a quarter timnes greater than that of oak and according to the experiments in the preceding Tables it appeals that thle iesist ance of wroughtiron plates to a force calculated to burst them follows l different law to that of oak the resistance of the former being irectly as the depth and of the latter as the square of the depth ReasonDing from these facts it ay be interesting to know that in the use of timber such

determine the value of iron chiefly in reference to its application for the purposes of shipbuilding It now only remains to determine the best form and condition of another part of the structure namely the frames and ribs of vessels also composed of iron Some of the forms ex perimented upon indicate weakness but certain modifications which have since been introduced have given increased support to the bilge and sides of the ship and greater powers of resistance to the outer sheathing The beam shown at fig  19 Plate LVIII is probably one of the strongest and most suitable for the support of the decks but it is inadmissible as a frame for receiving the exterior sheathing plates These frames are generally formed of a plate with angleirons along the edges on both sides of which the annexed sketch are sections a a C Fig 15 represents a portion of the outside plates D b b the angleiron frames or ribs which vary from 18 to A4 inches asunder ac i n i A b cording to the position

the sides of the ship and giving in creased resistance to those parts also to receive interior plates some of which in large vessels are riveted diagonally to the interior angleirons c c c forming stringers and braces from the kelsons round the bilge to the upper decks Other kinds of frames might be used with double Fig 16 angleiron as shown at d d c in the annexed iCa sketch but they are more expensive and from the increased complexity of construction the  extra strength obtained does not compensate for a the difference of cost Altogether the frames recorded in fig 15 have come into general use as the most effective and easy of construction Those experimented upon were of different kinds as shown in Plate LVIII fig 17 18 c and in sections given in the Tables and from which the

experiment shows the superior quality of wroughtiron beams in giving timely notice before fracture it further exhibits weakness on the top sides of the beams a circumstance requiring great attention in their construction which in some recent experiments instituted for attaining the section of greatest strength have been strikingly developed In the preceding experiments we have endeavoured to compare the strengths as well as the weights of the beams or frames which form the ribs of ships As regards the strengths with equal weights it is in favour of oak but the circunistance of the fastenings by rivets in the sheathing being so much superior to those of timber the iron shipbuilder is enabled to dispense with onehalf the number of frames and consequently a great reduction of weight is effected and more strength obtained in the vessel as a whole than could possibly be accomplished in the timberbuilt ship however ingenious the construction or the arrangement and distribution of the material The very act of caulking the joints of a wooden vessel has a tendency to loosen the fastenings whereas in the iron ship there are no actual joints for the whole being bound together en masse the same or nearly the same strength is obtained as if the whole ship were composed of solid plates and ribs The best sectional form of beams for the decks of ships is probably that exhi bited in Table XX which along with the box beam of the annexed form for supporting the shafts and paddleboxes of steamers is that generally used in the construction of vessels of this description Other forms have been adopted particularly those suggested by Mr KENNEDY of Liver pool alluded to in the Appendix  Having carefully investigated the different properties of wrought iron in its varied forms of construction and conceiving that the results obtained from the experiments may be useful in a variety of circumstances connected with the useful arts I have endeavoured to collect them in the abstract in order that the practical builder and engineer may the more readily ascertain the comparative value of the different forms of beams the properties of the material and their adaptation to any particular con struction in which he may be engaged Should further information be required we must then refer to the experiments in which will be found the facts more in detail and which are probably better calculated to satisfy the inquiring mind and to effect that conviction essential to success I have not attempted any inquiry into the laws of oxidation the adhesion of bar nacles and marine vegetation and the means necessary to prevent such evils This is a subject which does not come within the province of the present inquiry and more properly belongs to that of the chemist I would however briefly notice that in the whole of my experience I have had little to complain of from the effects of oxidation as that destructive process as regards iron appears to be greatly mitigated if not almost suspended by constant use and under the influence of vibratory action the operation appears to be rendered nugatory if it does not entirely cease and that  See my work on the Construction of the Britannia and Conuway Tubular BridgesINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 711 under circumstances exceedingly difficult to explain This is an investigation not unworthy the attention of somle of our best chemists to whom the causes may be known but which are at present as far as I know unaccounted for For example I may mention that an iron ship if kept constantly in use or nearly so will last for a number of years exposed to all the changes of weather and temperature without any sensible appearance of decay The same may be said of iron rails over which are passing daily such enormous weights and at such velocities as almost to neu tralize the action of the elements All these are striking examples of the durability of wrought iron which may be considered as an important element of its security and a recommendation for its extended application There is another circumstance in connection with this subject to which it may be necessary in this place to advert and that is the effect which a long continuance in salt water has upon the hull of an iron ship It is well known that a long immersion of cast iron in the sea will con vert it into plumbago and that a similar process with malleable iron from its contact with the saline particles of the ocean produces oxidation and in case the immersions were long continued the effects of this destructive process might endanger the safety of the ship As yet we have not had sufficient evidence of its effects to enable us to come to any definite conclusion but it is not improbable that an occasional visit to harbours of fresh water may mitigate if it does not entirely neutralize the inju rious effects which the material is likely to sustain With these observations which I offer with diffidence I now beg to direct attention to the abstracts as deduced from the experiments Abstract of Results as obtainedfrom the experiments In Part I of this inquiry we have endeavoured to show that 50000lbs per square inch is the mean breaking weight of iron plates whether torn asunder in the direc tion of the fibre or across it and we have also shown that the tensile strength of different kinds of timber drawn in the direction of the fibre varies in a given ratio to that of iron the timber in this comparison being represented by unity we have the following ratio of strength Timber Iron Ash as1  294 Teak as 1  333 Fir as 1  416 Beech as I  434 Oak as     1  500 These for practical purposes may be taken as a fair measure of the strength of the different woods as compared with that of iron plates It has been shown that wroughtiron plates when riveted together lose a consi derable portion of their strength as mav be seen by the experiments in Part IV where the plates by their union with each other lose by the ordinary process of riveting 44 per cent and by the best mode of riveting 30 per cent This should not however712 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY create serious alarm as the loss of strength is almost entirely obviated by the new pro cess of riveting used in the bottom of the Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges and it should also be observed that in timber the same injuries are sustained by splicing or any other method of forming the joints as are here exhibited in the rivet ing of iron plates The two processes that of riveting according to the method used in the experiments and splicing when intended to resist a tensile strain must therefore be considered analogous and the comparison under such circumstances will nearly follow the same law as regards a diminution of strength In this section of the inquiry the results obtained from the experiments indicate a loss in the joints as compared with the solid plate as the numbers 100 70 and 56 ViZ For the solid plate 100 For the doubleriveted joint    70 For the singleriveted joint    56 which numbers may be considered as a fair average value of the strengths of the different parts of vessels constructed in this manner Part V exhibits the strength of plates to resist vertical pressure from a blunt in strument which was forced through them for the purpose of ascertaining their com parative powers of resistance with oak timber placed under circumstances precisely similar and subjected to the same force The results are interesting as the iron plates appear to follow a different law in their resistance to pressure to that of oak the strength being as the depth or thickness of the plates in the first case and as the squares of the depth in the second The resistances aretherefore ill the ratio of 1  12 the iron being 12 times stronger than oak In Part IV we have some curious facts illustrative of the necessity and value of ex perimental research In the earlier experiments of the inquiry it is evident that angle and T iron beams or frames are not the best as regards form to resist a transverse strain In every case they are weak and although exceedingly useful and in fact indispensable for many purposes of construction they are nevertheless not calculated to resist strain in the form of beams or girders These defects I have endeavoured to obviate by the introduction of beams with double flanges formed of a body plate and riveted angleirons at the top and bottoin All these latter constructions may how ever be left with safety to the practical engineer The strengths of nearly the whole of these beams have been mathematically inves tigated by Mr TATE to whose friendship and analytical research I am indebted for the annexed mathematical inquiry into the different forms of the wroughtiron beams which have been experimented upon To the mathematician this part of the subject will be the more interesting as the utmost care has been observed in the measurements  See my process of chainriveting as exhibited in the lower sides of the Britannia and Conway Tubular Bridges where the injuries above enumerated are entirely obviated 1 For a more elaborate inquiry

W3142XI 13153 148 83153 X 48 X 0002 l317 tons and S1 186 109 tons ObservationsThe value of S determined from experiment 1 is the resistance of the material to extension whereas the value of S determined from experiment 3 is the resistance to compression Hence it appears that in beams of this form and thickness of plates the resistance to extension is equal to that of compression  The same observation applies to the values of S determined from experiments 7 and 8 and the same law also holds true for experiments 9 and 10 These calculations further show that the material in these beams is not properly distributed for while the thin side of the beam is about to undergo rupture the broad side has not attained onehalf of the tension or compression as the case may be which it is capable of sustaining It will also be observed that the resistance of the material at the thin side as in dicated by these calculations is greater than what it would be under ordinary circum stances viz about 25 tons per square inch This apparent discrepancy may be ex plained as follows as a beam of wrought iron approaches the limit of tension it un lergoes an accelerated rate of elongation even while the cohesion of the material re mains unimpaired Now this unusual extension of the particles in the lower laminge in a beam having a single flanch placed upwards allows a succession of particles in the higher lamina to come into full tensile strain so that the particles at the lower edge of the beam apparently attain a tensile strain greater than they would have under ordinary circumstances And it may be presumed that a similar law obtains in reference to the compression of wroughtiron beams Hence it follows that all calculations which assume the tensile or compressive forces in beams of this form at the edges of the beam equal to what they are under ordinary circumstances must lead to erroneous results  See remarks on experiment 2 p 720 4 y 2716 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY It may be further worthy of remark that experiments 2 and 3 8 and 7 show that when the flanches of the beams are placed upwards the deflections are considerably greater than what they are when the flanches

wrought iron even when repeated to the extent of four times In practice it may not be prudent to test bars and chains to their utmost limit of resist ance  it is however satisfactory to know that in cases of emergency those limits may be approached without incurring serious risk of injury to the ultimate strength of the material It is further important to observe that the elongations are not in

Length of bar Elongation Elongationper unit of length inINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 723 Here it appears that the rate of elongation of bars of wrought iron increases with the decrease of their length thus while a bar of 720 inches has an elongation of 216 inch per unit of its length a bar of 10 inches has an elongation of 42 inch per unit of its length or nearly double what it is in the former case The relation be tween the length of and its maximum elongation per unit may be approximately ex pressed by the following formula viz 1182L  where L represents the length of the bar and I the elongation per unit of length of the bar These results are of some value as they exhibit the ductility of wrought iron at a low temperature and also the greatly increased strength which it exhibits with a re duced section under severe strain On some future occasion we may refer to this subject in order to show the bearing powers of wrought iron when compared with its elongated transverse section when reduced by forces sufficient to ensure fracture The following experiments were made to determine the transverse strength of beams recommended by Mr KENNEDY of Liverpool for

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108459,AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES AND THEIR RIVETED JOINTS AS APPLIED TO SHIPBUILDING AND VESSELS EXPOSED TO SEVERE STRAINS,I207005, 677  XXXV AN EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES AND THEIR RIVETED JOINTS AS APPLIED TO SHIP BUILDING AND VESSELS EXPOSED TO SEVERE STRAINS BY WILLIAM FAIRBAIRN ESQ COMMNUNICATED BY THE REV HENRY MOSELEY FRS RECEIVED APRIL 25READ JUNE 13 1850 TIE EXPERIMENTS HEREIN RECORDED WERE INSTITUTEDI EARLY IN THE SPRING OF 1838 AND BEFORE THE CLOSE OF THE FOLLOWING WINTER MOST OF THEM HAD BEEN COMPLETED OWING HOWEVER TO A LONG SERIES OF PROFESSIONAL ENGAGEMENTS THEY HAVE STOOD OVER WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME ADDITIONS MADE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO THE PRESENT TIME THE OBJECT OF THE INQUIRY WAS TWOFOLDFIRST TO ASCERTAIN BY DIRECT EXPERIMENT THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES AND THEIR RIVETED JOINTS IN THEIR APPLICATION AS MATERIALS FOR SHIPBUILDING AND SECONDLY TO DETERMINE THEIR RELATIVE VALUE WHEN USED AS A SUB STITUTE FOR WOOD ON THESE TWO POINTS IT CANNOT BE EXPECTED THAT OUR KNOWLEDGE SHOULD BE FAR ADVANCED AS A VERY FEW YEARS HAVE ELAPSED SINCE IT WAS ASSERTED THAT IRON FROM ITS HIGH SPECIFIC GRAVITY WAS NOT CALCULATED FOR SUCH A PURPOSE AND THAT THE GREATEST RISK WAS LIKELY TO BE INCURRED IN ATTEMPTING TO CONSTRUCT VESSELS OF WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDERED A DOUBTFUL MATERIAL TIME HAS HOWEVER PROVED THE FALLACY OF THESE VIEWS AND I HOPE IN THE FOLLOWING EXPEIRIMENTS TO SHOW THAT THE IRON SHIP WHEN PROPERLY CONSTRUCTED IS NOT ONLY MORE BUOVANT BUT SAFER AND MORE DURABLE THAN VESSELS BUILT OF THE STRONGEST ENGLISH OAK AT THE COMINENCETMET OF THE EXPERIMENTS I FELT DESIROUS OF CONDUCTING THEM UPON A SCALE OF SUCH MAGNITUDE AS WOULD SUPPLY SOUND PRACTICAL DATA AND AT THE SAME TIME ESTABLISH A SERIES OF RESULTS CALCULATED TO ENSURE CONFIDENCE AS WELL AS ECONOMY IN THE USE OF THE MATERIAL MY VIEWS WERE ABLY CARRIED OUT BY MR HODGKINSON WHO CONDUCTED THE EXPERIMENTS UNDER RILY DIRECTION AND FROM WHOM I RECEIVED VALUABLE ASSISTANCE IN CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO DIVIDE THE SUBJECT INTO FOUR DISTINCT PARTS 1ST THE STRENGTH OF PLATES WHEN TORN ASUNDER BY A DIRECT TENSILE STRAIN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIBRE AND WHEN TORN ASUNDER ACROSS IT 2NDLV ON THE STRENGTH OF THE JOINTS OF PLATES WHEN UNITED BY RIVETS AS COMPARED XWITH THE PLATES THERMSELVES 3RDLY ON THE RESISTANCE OF PLATES TO THE FORCE OF COMPRESSION WHETHER APPLIED BY A DEAD WVEILIT OR BY IMPTACT678 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY AND LASTLY ON THE STRENGTH AND VALUE OF WROUGHTIRON FRAMES AND RIBS AS APPLIED TO SHIPS AND OTHER VESSELS PART I AT THE COMMENCEMENT OF IRON SHIPB UILDING IN WHICH I TOOK AN ACTIVE PART THE ABSENCE OF ACKNOWLEDGED FACTS RELATIVE TO BTHE STRENGTH AND VARIED CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THE MATERIAL WAS APPLIED WAS THE PRINCIPAL REASON WHICH INDUCED ME TO ENTER UPON THIS INQUIRY I HAVE EXTENDED THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE BEST METHODS OF RIVET ING AND THE PROPORTIONAL STRENGTH OF RIVETS JOINTS C AS COMPARED WITH THE PLATES AND THE USES FOR WHICH THEY ARE INTENDED THE LATTER IS A PRACTICAL AND HIGHLY IM PORTANT INQUIRY AS GREAT DIFFERENCE OF OPINION EXISTS AMONGST ENGINEERS AND OTHERS AS TO THE FORM STRENGTH AND PROPORTIONS OF RIVETS AND THE JOINTS OF WHICH THEY FORM AN ESSENTIAL PART I THEREFORE CONSIDERED AN EXPERIMENTAL INVESTIGATION MUCH WANTED NOT ONLY ON ACCOUNT OF ITS IMPORTANT PRACTICAL BEARING BUT WHAT WAS PROBABLY OF EQUAL VALUE IN ORDER TO REMOVE EXISTING DISCREPANCIES AND TO ESTABLISH A SOUNDER PRINCIPLE OF CONSTRUCTION FOUNDED UPON THE UNERRING BASIS OF EXPERIMENT FROM THESE CONSIDERATIONS I BESTOWED INCREASED ATTENTION UPON THE INQUIRY AND ENDEAVOURED TO RENDER IT PRACTICALLY USEFUL BEFORE DETAILING THE EXPERIMENTS IT MAY BE NECESSARY TO DESCRIBE THE APPARATUS BY WHICH THE RESULTS WERE OBTAINED THE ANNEXED DRAWINGS PLATE LIV REPRESENT A SIDE AND END VIEW OF THE APPARATUS USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS THE LARGE LEVER A WAS MADE OF MALLEABLE IRON AND WAS FIXED TO THE LOWER CROSS BEAM B FIG 1 BY A STRONG BOLT 0 WHICH PASSED THROUGH IT AT B AT THE TOP END OF THIS BOLT A PREPARATION WAS MADE TO RECEIVE THE END OF THE LEVER AND BY MEANS OF THE SCREWNUT AT A THE LEVER A WAS RAISED OR LOWERED TO SUIT THE LENGTH OF THE PLATES TO BE EXPERIMENTED UPON UPON THE TOP SIDE OF THE BEAM AND UNDER THE GABLE WALL OF A BUILDING FIVE STORIES HIGH WERE PLACED TWO CASTIRON COLUMNS D D WHICH RETAINED THE BEAM B IN ITS PLACE AND PREVENTED IT FROM RISING WHEN THE LEVER WAS HEAVILY LOADED DURING THE EXPERIMENT THE FRAME E GUIDED THE END OF THE LEVER AND THE WEIGHT W AND CLOSE TO THE FULCRUM WERE PLACED TWO WOODEN STANDARDS  SEVERAL IMPORTANT FACTS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF IRON SHIPS HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED SINCE MY EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE BUT I APPREHEND NONE OF THEM HAVE TENDED IN THE LEAST DEGREE TO DIMINISH THEIR VALUE NOR HAVE THEY TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE BEEN SUPERSEDED BY OTHERS OF A MORE ELABORATE OR MORE DECISIVE CHARACTER IT IS TRUE THAT A SERIES OF INTERESTING AND IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE AT THE INSTANCE OF THE ADMIRALTY ON THE EFFECT OF SHOT UPON THE SIDES OF IRON SHIPS AT SOME OF THESE EXPERIMENTS I HAD THE HONOUR TO BE PRESENT AND WITNESSED SOME CURIOUS AND UNEXPECTED RESULTS THE FIRST SERIES WAS CONDUCTED AT THE ARSENAL WOOLWICH AND SUBSEQUENTLY OTHERS WERE MADE AT PORTSMOUTH BOTH WERE IMPORTANT AS RESPECTS THE EFFECT OF SHOT UPON WROUGHTIRON PLATES WITH ENLARGED AND DIMINISHED CHARGES OF POWDER AND AT DIFFERENT VELOCITIES BUT DISCOURAGING AS REGARDS THE USE OF IRON IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF SHIPS OF WAR THESE EXPERIMENTS HOWEVER INTERESTING IN THEMSELVES DO NOT APPEAR TO BE CONCLUSIVE AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT THE APPARENT DANGER INDICATED BY THE EXPERIMENTS MAY YET BE OVERCOME AND THE SUPERIORITY AS WELL AS THE GREATER SECURITY OF THE IRON SHIP FULLY ESTABLISHEDZZ 5 D CCCL L97LO

IS A FALLING OFF IN THE STRENGTH OF ABOUT 21 PER CENT THE RATIO BEING IN FAVOUR OF BAR IRON AS 1 035 8209 IN TREATING OF THE STRENGTH OF IRON IT MAY BE USEFUL TO COMPARE THE FOREGOING EXPE RIMENTS ON THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF PLATES WITH THOSE OF A SIMILAR DESCRIPTION ON TIMBER ON THIS SUBJECT I FEEL THE MORE DESIROUS OF ESTABLISHING A COMPARISON AS THE TWO KINDS OF MATERIAL ARE NOW APPLIED TO SIMILAR PURPOSES SUCH AS SHIPBUILDING AND OTHER CON STRUCTIONS AND THE QUESTION BECOMES EVERY DAY MORE IMPORTANT AS TO WHICH OF THE TWO MATERIALS IS THE BEST THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE ADVOCATES OF IMPROVE MENT WOULD ARRANGE THEMSELVES ON THE SIDE OF IRON AND THOSE FOR THE C WOODEN WALLS WOULD BE EQUALLY ZEALOUS ON THAT OF TIMBER THIS IS HOWEVER A QUESTION WHICH TIME AND EXPERIENCE ALONE CAN DETERMINE AND CONCEIVING THAT OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PRO PERTIES OF IRON AS A MATERIAL FOR SHIPBUILDING IS FAR FROM PERFECT WE MAY SAFELY LEAVE ITS FINAL DECISION TO THE EVIDENCE OF EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCH AND A MORE EXTENDED AP PLICATION OF ITS PRACTICAL RESULTS WHEN WE ATTEMPT A COMPARISON OF THE VALUE OF ONE MATERIAL IN ITS APPLICATION TO A SPECIFIC PURPOSE WITH THAT OF ANOTHER MATERIAL SIMILARLY APPLIED THE COMPARISON IS ONLY CORRECT WHEN THE TWO MATERIALS ARE PLACED IN JUXTAPOSITION OR WHEN THEY ARE CONTRASTED UNDER THE SAME CIRCUMSTANCES AS TO THE TRIALS AND TESTS TO WHICH THEY ARE RESPECTIVELY SUBJECTED NOW IN THIS COMPARISON I AM FORTUNATE IN HAVING BEFORE ME THE ABLE EX PERINMENTS OF MUSSCHENBROCK BUFFON AND THOSE OF A MNORE RECENT DATE ON DIRECT CO HESION BY

HIS OWN A CIRCUMSTANCE PROBABLY NOT DIFFICULT TO ACCOUNT FOR AS THE DIFFERENT DEGREES OF DRYNESS HAVE A GREAT EFFECT UPON THE STRENGTH OF TIMBER DR ROBISON IN SPEAKING OF THE EXPERIMENTS OF MUSSCHENBROCK STATES THAT WE MAY PRESUME THEY WERE CAREFULLY MADE AND FAITHFULLY NARRATED BUT THEY WERE MADE ON SUCH SMALL SPECIMENS THAT THE UNAVOIDABLE NATURAL INEQUALITIES OF GROWTH OR TEX TURE PRODUCED IRREGULARITIES IN THE RESULTS WBICH HAVE TOO GREAT A PROPORTION TO THE WHOLE QUANTITIES OBSERVED IT IS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I GIVE PREFERENCE TO MR BARLOWS RESULTS AS HE OBSERVES THAT THE EXPERIMENTS FROM WHICH THEY ARE DRAWN WERE MADE WITH EVERY POSSIBLE CARE THE DELICACY OF THE OPERATION WOULD ADMIT ASSUMING THEREFORE THAT BARLOW IS CORRECT AND TAKING THE MEAN STRENGTH OF IRON PLATES AS GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING TABLES AT 49656 LBS TO THE SQUARE INCH OR CALLING IT 50000 LBS AND THE RESISTANCE OF THE DIRECT COHESION OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF TIMBER AS GIVEN BY MR BARLOW THE FOLLOWING

MATERIAL EX POSED TO A GREAT VARIETY OF STRAINS OR WHEN USED FOR SHEATHING AND SIMILAR PURPOSES IN THE ART OF SHIPBUILDING THE TEAK WOOD BEING TIMBER OF GREATER DENSITY AND OF  IT HAS BEEN SHOWN BY MR HODGKINSON THAT TIMBER WHEN WET WILL BE CRUSHED BY A FORCE LESS THAN ONE HALF OF WHAT WOULD TAKE TO CRUSH IT WHEN DRY IT THEREFORE FOLLOWS THAT MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE SAMPLES SELECTED AND THE WAY IN WHICH THE TIMBER HAS BEEN SEASONED6 18MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY HIGHER SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS BETTER CALCULATED TO RESIST SHOCKS THAN A TOUGH FIBROUS SUBSTANCE OF A SOFT AND SPONGY NATURE SUCH AS FIR ON THIS SUBJECT IT SHOULD HOWEVER BE NOTICED THAT WHATEVER MATERIAL IS USED FOR COVERING THE RIBS OF VESSELS IT SHOULD BE STRONG AND ELASTIC IN ORDER TO RESIST NOT ONLY THE FORCE OF DIRECT TENSION BUT THAT OF LATERAL AND COMPRESSED ACTION IN A SHIP AT SEA THESE FORCES ARE STRIKINGLY EXEMPLIFIED AND THAT UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES EMBAR RASSING AS WELL TO THE PRACTICAL BUILDER AS THE MAN OF SCIENCE REMARKS ON THEFOREGOTNG EZPERIMENTS HAVING DETERMINED THE STRENGTH OF IRON PLATES WHEN DRAWN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIBRE AS WELL AS ACROSS IT AND HAVING COMPARED THE RESULTS WITH EXPERIMENTS OF A SIMILAR CHARACTER ON TIMBER IT MAY BE USEFUL TO OFFER A FEW GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON THE QUESTION NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION DR ROBINSON IN HIS ARTICLE ON THE STRENGTH OF MATERIALS WHEN DISCUSSING THE NA TURE OF A STRETCHING FORCE APPLIED TO MATERIALS OBSERVES  THAT IN PULLING A BODY ASUNDER THE FORCE OF COHESION IS DIRECTLY OPPOSED WITH VERY LITTLE IMODIFICATION OF ITS ACTION THAT ALL PARTS ARE EQUALLY STRETCHED AND THE STRAIN IN EVERY TRANSVERSE SEC TION IS THE SAME IN EVERY PART OF THAT SECTION FROM THIS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT A BODY OF A HOMOGENEOUS TEXTURE WILL HAVE THE COHESION OF ITS PARTS EQUAL AND SINCE EVERY PART IS EQUALLY STRETCHED IT FOLLOWS THAT THE PARTICLES WILL BE DRAWN TO EQUAL DISTANCES AND THE FORCES THUS EXERTED MUST BE EQUAL NOW IF THIS WERE TRUE THE AP PLICATION OF AN EXTERNAL FORCE TO A BODY MIGHT BE INCREASED TO SUCH AN EXTENT AS NOT ONLY TO SEPARATE THE PARTS FURTHEST ASUNDER BUT ULTIMATELY TO DESTROY THE COHESION OF ALL THE PARTICLES AT ONCE A CIRCUMSTANCE UNDER WHICH INSTANTANEOUS RUPTURE WOULD FOLLOW AS A RESULT THESE VIEWS ARE HOWEVER NOT BORNE OUT BY FACTS AS THE EXPERI MENTS OF MR HODGKMINSON ON IRON WIRE SHOW THAT THE SAME IRON MAY BE TORN ASUN DER MANY TIMES IN SUCCESSION WITHOUT IMPAIRING ITS STRENGTHF AND SOME RECENT EXPE RIMENTS AT THE ROYAL DOCKYARD WOOLWICH CLEARLY SHOW THAT AN IRON BAR MAY BE STRETCHED UNTIL ITS TRANSVERSE SECTION IS CONSIDERABLY REDUCED AND ULTIMATELY BROKEN WITHOUT INJURY TO ITS TENSILE STRENGTH NAY MORE THE SAME IRON SO ELONGATED WHEN AGAIN SUBMITTED TO EXPERIMENT EXHIBITED INCREASED STRENGTH AND CONTINUED TO IN CREASE UNDER CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BEYOND THE BEARING POWERS OF THE SAME BAR IN ITS ORIGINAL FORMT THAT ALL THE PARTS OF A BODY  SUBJECTED TO A TENSILE STRAIN ARE EQUALLY STRETCHED  IS THEREFORE QUESTIONABLE BODIES VARY CONSIDERABLY IN THEIR POWERS OF RE SISTANCE AND EXHIBIT PECULIAR PROPERTIES OF COHESION UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF FORCES CAL CULATED TO TEAR THEM ASUNDER FIBROUS SUBSTANCES FOR INSTANCE SUCH AS ROPES AND SONIC KINDS OF TINGBER HAVING THEIR FIBRES TWISTED ARE ENABLED TO RESIST TENSION UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF CONSIDERABLE ELONGATION WITHOUT IMPAIRING THEIR ULTIMATE STRENGTH

ARE BROUGHT INTO ACTION AT ONCE AS MUCH DEPENDS UPON THE CONDITIONS OF THE BODY THE UNEQUAL STATE OF TENSION OF ITS PARTS AND THE STRAIN WHICH SOME OF THE PARTICLES MUST SUSTAIN BEFORE THE OTHERS RECEIVE THEIR DUE PORTION OF THE LOAD SHOULD THE NONRESISTING PARTICLES BE WITHIN THE LIMITS OF ELONGATION OF THE OTHER PARTICLES THE BODY WILL THEN HAVE ATTAINED ITS MAXIMUM POWER OF RESISTANCE BUT IN THE EVENT OF RUPTURE TO ANY OF THE RESISTING PARTICLES THE COHESIVE FORCE OF THE BODY IS THEREBY REDUCED AND THAT TO THE EXTENT OF THE INJURY SUSTAINED BY THE FRAC TURED PARTS THERE ARE HOWEVER AS DR ROBINSON TRULY OBSERVES IMMENSE VARIETIES IN THE STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION OF BODIES WHICH LEAD TO IMPORTANT FACTS AND PROVE THAT THE ABSOLUTE COHESION OF ALL BODIES WHATEVER BE THEIR TEXTURE IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE AREAS OF THEIR SECTIONS UNDOUBTEDLY THIS IS THE CASE IN BODIES HAVING AN UNIFORM TEXTURE WITH STRAIGHT FIBRES AND HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE ABSOLUTE STRENGTH OF A BODY RESISTING A TENSILE STRAIN WILL BE AS THE AREA OF ITS SECTION THE PECULIAR NATURE OF THE MATERIAL COMBINING A CRYSTALLINE AS WELL AS A FIBROUS STRUCTURE HAS LED TO THESE OBSERVATIONS IN SOME INSTANCES THE SPECIMENS EXPERI MENTED UPON EXHIBITED AN ALMOST DISTINCT FIBROUS TEXTURE AND IN OTHERS A CLEARLY DE VELOPED CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE AT OTHER TIMES SOME OF THE SPECIMENS WERE OF A MIXED KIND WITH THE CRYSTALLINE AND FIBROUS FORMS UNITED THE FRACTURE HAVING A LAMINATED APPEARANCE WITH THE CRYSTALLINE PARTS CLOSELY BOUND ON EACH SIDE BY LAYERS OF THE FIBROUS STRUCTURE THESE VARIETIES ARE PROBABLY PRODUCED IN THE MANUFACTURE AND MAY BE EASILY EFFECTED EITHER BY THE MODE OF PILING  THE LAYERS OF BARS WHICH FORM THE PLATE OR FROM THE UNEQUAL TEMPERATURE OF THE PARTS AS THEY PASS THROUGH THE ROLLS BUT WHICHEVER WAY THEY ARE PRODUCED IT IS EVIDENT FROM THE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE FRACTURES GAVE IN MOST CASES INDICATIONS OF AN UNEQUAL AND VARIED TEXTURE IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS AND ALSO IN THOSE WHICH FOLLOW GREAT ATTENTION WAS PAID TO THE APPEARANCE OF THE FRACTURE IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLATE AND TO DETERMINE HOW FAR IT COULD BE DEPENDED UPON IN ITS APPLICATION TO THE

STRENGTH AND POWER OF BEING MOULDED ROLLED AND FORGED INTO ALMOST EVERY SHAPE IT IS NOT ONLY THE STRONGEST BUT IN MANY RESPECTS THE MOST ELIGIBLE MATE RIAL FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF VESSELS EXPOSED TO SEVERE STRAIN LARGE VESSELS COMPOSED OF IRON PLATES SUCH AS STEAMBOILERS CISTERNS SHIPS C CANNOT HOWEVER BE FORMED UPON THE ANVIL OR THE ROLLINGMILL THEY ARE CONSTRUCTED OF MANY PIECES AND THESE PIECES HAVE TO BE JOINED TOGETHER IN SUCH A MANNER AS TO ENSURE THE REQUISITE STRENGTH AND EFFECT ALL THE REQUIREMENTS OF SOUND CONSTRUCTION THIS OPERATION IS CALLED RIVET ING AND ALTHOUGH PRACTICALLY UNDERSTOOD IT HAS NOT TO MY KNOWLEDGE ON ANY PREVIOUS OCCASION RECEIVED THAT ATTENTION WHICH THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT DEMANDS UP TO THE PRESENT TIME NOTHING OF CONSEQUENCE HAS BEEN DONE TO IMPROVE OR ENHANCE THE VALUE OF THIS PROCESS WE POSSESS NO FACTS OR EXPERIMENTS CALCULATED TO ESTABLISH PRINCIPLES SUFFICIENT TO GUIDE OUR OPERATIONS IN EFFECTING CONSTRUCTIONS OF THIS KIND ON WHICH THE LIVES OF THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS THE PROPERTY OF INDIVIDUALS DEPEND IN FACT SUCH HAS BEEN OUR IGNORANCE OF THE RELATIVE STRENGTH OF PLATES AND THEIR RIVETED JOINTS THAT UNTIL THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE PRESENT INQUIRY THE SUBJECT WAS CONSIDERED OF SCARCELY SUFFICIENT IMPORTANCE TO MERIT ATTENTION EVEN NOW IT IS BY MANY ASSUMED THAT A WELLRIVETED JOINT IS STRONGER THAN THE PLATE ITSELF AND A NUMBER OF PERSONS JUDGING FROM APPEARANCES ALONE CONCUR IN THAT OPINION NOW THIS IS A GREAT MISTAKE AND ALTHOUGH THE DOUBLE THICKNESS OF THE JOINT INDICATES INCREASED STRENGTH IT IS NEVERTHELESS MUCH WEAKER THAN THE SOLID PLATE A CIRCUMSTANCE OF SOME IMPORTANCE AS WE HOPE TO SHOW IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS IT WOULD PROBABLY BE SUPERFLUOUS TO OFFER ANY LENGTHENED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIN CIPLE UPON WHICH WROUGHTIRON PLATES ARE UNITED TOGETHER RIVETING IS SO FAMILIAR TO EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR A WORK OF SUPEREROGATION TO AT TEMPT IT AND ASSUMING THAT THE USUAL METHOD OF

CLOSED AND HENCE FOLLOW THE DEFECTS OF LEAKY RIVETS AND IMPERFECT JOINTS IT IS EVIDENT THAT AN INSTRUMENT SUCH AS THE RIVETINGMACHINE HAVING SUFFICIENT FORCE TO COMPRESS THE RIVET AT ONCE OR WITHIN AN

THE RIVET IS SQUEEZED TIGHT INTO THE HOLE AND IN EVERY CASE EVEN WHERE THE HOLES ARE NOT EXACTLY STRAIGHT THE COMPRESSED RIVETS ARE NEVER LOOSE BUT FILL THE HOLES WITH THE SAME DEGREE OF TIGHTNESS AS IF PLACED DIRECTLY OPPOSITE TO EACH OTHER IF FOR EXAMPLE WE TAKE A CIRCULAR BOILER SUCH AS REPRESENTED AT A PLATE LVI FIG 3 AND HAVING ALL THE PERFORATIONS MADE AND THE PLATES ATTACHED TO EACH OTHER

THE DIE ADVANCES WHICH GIVES THE NIP OR GREATEST PRESSURE AT THE REQUIRED TIME NAMELY AT THE CLOSING OF THE RIVET FROM THIS DESCRIPTION IT WILL APPEAR THAT A VERY LIMITED PORTION OF TIME IS OCCUPIED IN THE PROCESS AND AS TWELVE RIVETS CAN BE INSERTED AND FINISHED BV THE MACHINE IN A MINUTE IT FOLLOWS FROM THE RAPIDITY OF THE OPERATION AND THE ABSENCE OF HAMMERING THAT THE DUCTILITY OF THE RIVETS

THE DISTANCES OF HOLES FOR NEARLY EVERY DESCRIPTION OF JOINT ALSO THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE WITH A COLUMN OF STRENGTHS AS DEDUCED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS IF WE EXAMINE THE NATURE OF THE FRACTURE IN THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE MACHINERIVETING IS SUPERIOR TO THAT DONE BY THE HAMNMER THE MEAN OF THE THREE FIRST EXPERIMENTS BEING TO THE MEAN OF THE FOURTH AND FIFTH AS 5  4 IN THE EIGHTH AND NINTH THE STRENGTHS ARE NEARLY THE SAME ON COMPARING THE STRENGTH OF PLATES WITH THEIR RIVETED JOINTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXAMINE THE SECTIONAL AREAS TAKEN IN A LINE THROUGH THE RIVETHOLES WITH THE SECTION OF THE PLATES THEMSELVES IT IS PERFECTLY OBVIOUS THAT IN PERFORATING A LINE OF HOLES ALONG THE EDGE OF A PLATE WE MUST REDUCE ITS STRENGTH AND IT IS ALSO CLEAR THAT THE PLATE SO PERFORATED WILL BE TO THE PLATE ITSELF NEARLY AS THE AREAS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SECTIONS WITH A SMALL DEDUCTION FOR THE IRREGULARITIES OF THE PRESSURE OF THE RIVETS UPON THE PLATE OR IN OTHER WORDS THE JOINT WILL BE REDUCED IN STRENGTH SOMEWHAT MORE THAN THE RATIO OF ITS SECTION THROUGH THAT LINE TO THE SOLID SECTION OF THE PLATE FOR EXAMPLE SUPPOSE TWO PLATES EACH 2 FEET WIDE AND THREEEIGHTHS OF AN INCH THICK TO BE RIVETED TOGETHER WITH TEN A INCH RIVETS IT IS EVIDENT THAT OUT OF 2 FEET THE LENGTH OF THLE JOINT THE STRENGTH OF THE PLATES IS REDUCED BY PERFORATION TO THE EXTENT OF 71 INCHES AND HERE THE STRENGTH OF THE PLATES WILL BE TO THAT OF THE JOINT AS 9 61875 WHICH IS NEARLY THE SAME AS THE RESPECTIVE AREAS OF THE SOLID PLATE AND THAT THROUGH THE RIVETHOLES NAMELY AS 24  165 FROM THESE FACTS IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE RIVETS CANNOT ADD TO THE STRENGTH OF THE PLATES THEIR OBJECT BEING TO KEEP THE TWO SURFACES OF THE LAP IN CONTACT AND BEING HEADED ON BOTH SIDES THE PLATES ARE BROUGHT INTO VERY CLOSE UNION BY THE CONTRACTION OR COOLING OF THE RIVETS AFTER THEY ARE CLOSED IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE PRESSURE OR ADHESION OF THE TWO SURFACES OF THE PLATES WOULD ADD TO THE STRENGTH BUT THIS IS NOT FOUND TO BE THE CASE TO ANY GREAT EXTENT AS IN ALMOST EVERY INSTANCE THE EXPERIMENTS INDICATE THE RESISTANCE TO BE IN THE RATIO OF THEIR SECTIONAL AREAS OR NEARLY SO IF WE TAKE THE ULTIMATE STRENGTH OF THE YORKSHIRE PLATES IN TABLES I AND II IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE MEAN BREAKING WEIGHT OF EIGHT SPECIMENS EACH WITH A SECTIONAL AREA OF 46 INCH IS 26168 AND THE STRENGTH OF THE SINGLE JOINT OF THE SAME DESCRIP TION OF PLATES WITH AN AREA OF A44 INCH IS 18591  THIS REDUCED GIVES THE RATIO OF THE  I USE THE TERM SINGLE JOINT TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM THE DOUBLE RIVETED

THAT PART WHERE THE PERFORATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE OF 32 PER CENT THE DIFFERENCE IS CONSIDERABLE BUT IT PROBABLY ARISES FROM THE NARROWNESS OF THE SPECIMEN AND THE LATERAL STRAIN INDUCED BY THE POSITION

WHEN THE COMPARATIVE MERITS OF PLATES AND THEIR RIVETED JOINTS WERE UNDER CONSI DERATION IT APPEARED DESIRABLE TO REPEAT SEVERAL OF THE EXPERIMENTS PARTICULARLY THOSE WHICH SEEMED TO THROW LIGHT UPON THEIR RELATIVE POWERS OF RESISTANCE I CONSIDERED THESE EXPERIMENTS TO BE OF IMPORTANCE AS THEY INCREASED OUR KNOWLEDGE AS RESPECTS THE STRENGTH OF THE MATERIAL AND ALSO ITS PROPERTIES IN COMBINATION IN SHIPBUILDING THESE OBJECTS ARE OF SORTE VALUE AS ANY REDUCTION IN THE POWERS OR PARTS OF A VESSEL BY IMPERFECT CONSTRUCTION OR MISAPPLIED MATERIAL MIGHT LEAD TO SERIOUS ERROR AND EVEN GREAT RISK TO THE SAFETY OF THE SHIP SINCE THE FIRST USE OF IRON FOR THESE OBJECTS IT HAS BEEN THE PRACTICE TO COUNTERSINK THE HEADS OF THE RIVETS IN ORDER TO PRESENT A SMNOOTH SURFACE FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE VESSEL THRONG H THE WATER THIS PRALCTICE IS IN GENERAL USE AT MY VORKS AT MILLWALL AND I BELIEVE THE SALME METHLODS ARE PURSUED AT THE ESTABLISHMTLENT OF MESSRS JOHN LAIRD AND CO AND OTHERS IN DFIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THE INTRODUCTION OF THIS SYSTEM OF RIVETING CAUSED A FTIRTHER EXTENSION OF THE EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO ELUCIDATE THE VARIOUS FORMS OF JOINTS GIVEN IN THE PRECEDING TRABLES AND FURTHER TO INVESTIGATE THE STRENGTH OF THE JOINT WITH A PLATE RIVETED ON EAICH SIDE WHICH APPEARS TO BE THE STRONGEST AND BEST CALCULATED TO RESIST A TENSILE STRAIN RITHIS DESCRIPTION OF JOINT IS SELDOM USED IN SHIPBULILDING BUT IN ORDER TO RENDER THE EXPCRIMENTS AS PERFECT AS MIDCCCLF4698 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY POSSIBLE IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO CONSIDER IT IN THIS PAPER WITH OTHERS OF EQUAL IMPORT ANCE AND PROBABLY OF MORE GENERAL USE THE SYSTEM OF COUNTERSINKING THE RIVETS IS ONLY USED WHEN SMOOTH SURFACES ARE RE QUIRED UNDER OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THEIR INTRODUCTION WOULD NOT BE DESIRABLE AS THEY DO NOT ADD TO THE STRENGTH OF THE JOINT BUT TO A CERTAIN EXTENT REDUCE IT THIS RE DUCTION IS NOT OBSERVABLE IN THE EXPERIMENTS BUT THE SIMPLE FACT OF SINKING THE HEAD OF THE RIVET INTO THE PLATE AND CUTTING OUT A GREATER PORTION OF METAL MUST OF NECESSITY LESSEN ITS STRENGTH AND RENDER IT WEAKER THAN THE PLAIN JOINT WITH RAISED HEADS THIS MUST APPEAR EVIDENT FROM THE FACT OF THE SECTIONAL AREA OF THE PLATE BEING DIMINISHED AND THE CONSEQUENT REDUCTION OF THE HEADS OF THE RIVETS WHICH IN THIS STATE ARE LESS ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE EFFECTS OF AN OBLIQUE OR TRANSVERSE STRAIN IT IS HOWEVER SATISFACTORY TO OBSERVE THAT COUNTERSINKING THE HEADS OF THE RIVETS DOES NOT SERIOUSLY INJURE THE JOINT IN ITS POWERS OF RESISTANCE TO A DIRECT TENSILE FORCE BUT THE RIVETS ARE LIABLE TO START WHEN EXPOSED TO COLLISIONS OR A STRONG IMPINGING FORCE SUCH AS THE SIDES OF SHIPS ARE FREQUENTLY DOOMED TO ENCOUNTER ON REFERRING TO EXPERIMENTS TABLE XI THE SAME RESULTS AS TO STRENGTH ARE OB TAINED WITH THE COUNTERSUNK RIVETS AS THOSE WITH ROUNDED HEADS THEY ARE RATHER UNDER THE MEAN OF THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS BUT NOT MORE THAN IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE REDUCED SECTION OF THE COUNTERSUNK PLATES THE JOINT WITH PLATES RIVETED ON EACH SIDE IS SELDOM USED A CIRCUMSTANCE WHICH PROBABLY ARISES FROM ITS GREATER COMPLEXITY OF FORM AND THE DANGER WHICH A TREBLE THICKNESS OF PLATE WOULD BE SUBJECT TO IF USED IN BOILERS OR VESSELS EXPOSED TO THE AC TION OF INTENSE HEAT IT IS ALSO INADMISSIBLE IN SHIPBUILDING AS THE SMOOTH SURFACE REQUIRES TO BE MAINTAINED AND THE GREATEST CARE OBSERVED IN THE FORMATION OF THE OUTER SHEATHING TO LESSEN THE RESISTANCE OF EVERY PART OF THE HULL IMMERSED IN THE WATER IN OTHER RESPECTS THE DOUBLERIVETED PLATE IS A STRONG JOINT AND IN EVERY CASE WHERE GREAT STRENGTH IS REQUIRED IT MAY BE USED WITH PERFECT SAFETY IT WILL BE UNNECESSARY TO GO THROUGH A FURTHER COMPARISON OF THE EXPERIMENTS AS SUFFICIENT DATA HAVE ALREADY BEEN FURNISHED TO

POWERS UNIMPAIRED THESE ARE IMPORTANT AND CONVINCING PROOFS OF THE SUPERIOR VALUE OF THE DOUBLE JOINT AND IN ALL CASES WHERE STRENGTH IS REQUIRED THIS DESCRIPTION OF JOINT SHOULD NEVER BE OMITTED ON REFERRING TO THE EXPERIMENTS CONTAINED IN THE SEPARATE TABLES THERE WILL BE FOUND A STRIKING COINCIDENCE IN THE FACTS TENDING TO ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE OF DOUBLE RIVETING AS SUPERIOR IN EVERY RESPECT TO THE GENERAL PRACTICE NOW IN USE OF THE SINGLE RIVETS IT APPEARS WHEN PLATES ARE RIVETED IN THIS MANNER THAT THE STRENGTH OF THE JOINTS IS TO THE STRENGTH OF THE PLATES OF EQUAL SECTIONS OF METAL AS THE NUMBERS 1000 1021 AND 791  IN A FORMER ANALYSIS IT WAS 1000 933 AND 731 WHICH GIVES US A MEAN OF 1000 977 AND 761 WHICH IN PRACTICE WE MAY SAFELY ASSUME AS THE CORRECT VALUE OF EACH EXCLUSIVE OF THIS DIFFERENCE WE MUST HOWEVER DEDUCT 30 PER CENT FOR THE LOSS OF METAL ACTUALLY PUNCHED OUT FOR THE RECEPTION OF THE RIVETS AND THE ABSOLUTE STRENGTH OF THE PLATES WILL THEN BE TO THAT OF THE RIVETED JOINTS AS THE NUMBERS 100 68 AND 46 IN SOME CASES WHERE THE RIVETS ARE WIDER APART THE LOSS SUSTAINED IS HOWEVER NOT SO GREAT  THE CAUSE OF THE INCREASE OF STRENGTH IN THE DOUBLERIVETED PLATES MAY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE RIVETED SPECI MENS BEING MADE FROM THE BEST IRON WHEREAS THE MEAN STRENGTH OF THE PLATES IS TAKEN FROM ALL THE IRONS EXPE RIMENTED UPON SOME OF INFERIOR QUALITY WHICH WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGH VALUE OF THE DOUBLERIVETED JOINT IN ORDINARY CASES AND IN PRACTICE IT WILL THEREFORE BE SAFER TO TAKE THE MEAN OF THE WHOLE VIZ STRENGTH OF PLATES   100 STRENGTH OF DOUBLERIVETING

TOTHAT EXTENT IN THIS ESTIMATE WE MUST HOWEVER TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE RESULTS WEIE OBTAINED AS ONLY TWO OR THREE RIVETS CAME WITHIN THE REACH OF EXPERIMENT AND AGAIN LOOKING AT THE INCREASE OF STRENGTH WHICH MIGHT BE GAINED BY HAVING A GREATER NUMBER OF RIVETS IN COMBINATION AND THE ADHESION OF THE TWO SURFACES OF THE PLATES IN CONTACT WHICH IN THE COMPRESSED RIVETS BY MACHINE IS CONSIDERABLE WE MAY FAIRLY ASSUME THE FOLLOW ING RELATIVE STRENGTHS AS THE VALUE OF PLATES WITH THEIR RIVETED JOINTS TAKING THE STRENGTH OF THE PLATE AT 100 THE STRENGTH OF THE DOUBLERIVETED JOINT WOULD THEN BE  70 AND THE STRENGTH OF THE SINGLERIVETED JOINT  56 THESE PROPORTIONS MAY THEREFORE IN PRACTICE BE SAFELY TAKEN AS NEARLY THE STANDARD VALUE OF JOINTS SUCH AS USED IN VESSELS WHERE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BE STEAM OR WATER TIGHT AND SUBJECTED TO PRESSURE VARYING FROM 10 TO 100 LBS UPON THE SQUARE INCH SINCE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN I HAVE ASCERTAINED ON A RECENT VISIT TO BRISTOL THAT THE LARGE STEAMNSHIP NOW BUILDING THERE IS DOUBLERIVETED THE PLATES BEING THREEFOURTHS OF AN INCH THICK OVER THE BOTTOM AND BILGE AND FIVEEIGHTHS THICK UP TO THE WATER LINE THESE PLATES ARE JOINED TOGETHER WITH DOUBLE RIVETS OF 1 INCH DIAMETER AND IN SERTED AT DISTANCES OF 3 INCHES APART THE PROPORTIONS APPEAR TO BE GOOD AND CON CEIVING THE WORKMANSHIP TO BE EQUALLY SO I SHOULD INFER THAT THIS FINE VESSEL WOULD FAIRLY ESTABLISH THE PRINCIPLE THAT ITON IN ALL THE RAMIFICATIONS OF SHIPBUILDING IS AN ARTICLE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE TO THE WAI AS WELL AS TO THE MERCANTILE NAVY IN THE PURSUIT OF THE FOREGOING INQUIRY I WAS NATURALLY LED TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE BEST PROPORTIONS AND IEST FORMS OF RIVETING PLATES TOGETHER I INVESTIGATED THIS SUBJECT WITH GREAT CARE AND FROM MY OWN

PRACTICAL BEARING ON THE QUESTION OF THE STRENGTH OF ROLLED PLATES AND THE BEST METHODS OF UNITING THEM TOGETHER IN CONCLUSION I WOULD VENTURE A FEW REMARKS ON THE VALUE AND JUDICIOUS USE OF THIS MATERIAL IN ITS ADAPTATION TO SHIP BUILDING AND OTHER PURPOSES TO WHICH IT MAY BE SUCCESSFULLY APPLIED IT IS NOT MY INTENTION TO ENTER INTO THE QUESTION AS TO WHETHER WOOD OR IRON BE THE PREFERABLE MATERIAL AS A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS COST DURABILITY C MUST BE CON SIDERED IN ORDER TO FORM A CORRECT DECISION I WOULD HOWEVER OBSERVE THAT IN SHIPBUILDING ALONE IT APPEARS FROM THE FACTS ALREADY RECORDED THAT IRON IS VERY SUPERIOR IN ITS POWERS OF RESISTANCE TO STRAIN IT IS HIGHLY DUCTILE IN ITS CHARACTER AND EASILY MOULDED INTO ANY REQUIRED FORM WITHOUT IMPAIRING ITS STRENGTH IT IS ALSO STRONGER IN COMBINATION THAN TIMBER ARISING FROM THE NATURE OF THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE MATERIALS COMPOSING THE ITRON SHIP BECOME A HOMOGENEOUS MASS WHEN UNITED TOGETHER FORMING AS IT WERE A SOLID WITHOUT JOINTS AND PRESENTING AS A WHOLE THE MOST FORMIDABLE POWERS OF RESISTANCE THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROPERTIES WHICH APPEAR TO DISTINGUISH IRON FROM OTHER MATERIALS AND WHICH GIVE IT AN ASCENDENEV OF COM INBINED ACTION WHICH CANNOT BE OBTAINED IN THE UNION OF TIMBER HOWEVER INGENIOUSLY CONT RIVED IT MOREOVER POSSESSES THE PROPERTY OF LIGHTNESS ALONG WITH STRENGTH  IN FACT ITS BUOYANCY STRENGTH AND DURABILITY CON STITUTE THE ELEMENTS OF ITS UTILITY IN THE INNUMERABLE CASES TO WHICH IT MAY BE APPLIED IN SHIPBUILDING IT POSSESSES OTHER ADVANTAGES OVER TIMBER ITS HULL IS FLEE FROTM THE  SINCE THE ABOVE WAS WRITTEN WE HAVE HAD MANY EXAMPLES OF THE ENORMOUS STRENGTH OF IRON SHIPS AND AMONGST OTHERS WE MAY INSTANCE AN IRON VESSEL WHICH TOOK THE GROUND WITH NEARLY ONEHALF OF HER LENGTH AT THE STERN HANGING OVER A SHELF FOR A WHOLE TIDE ANOTHER THE VANGUARD IRON STEAMER WHICH FOR SEVERAL HOURS UNDER THE ACTION OF A HEAVY SURF WAS BEATING UPON SHARP SHELVING ROCKS WITHOUT GOING TO PIECES AND LASTLY THE GREAT BRITAIN STEAMSHIP WHICH WAS STRANDED IN DUNDRUM BAY AND RESISTED THE FORCE OF THE WINTER STORMS FOR MNANY MNONTHS702 MR FAIHBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY RISK OF FIRE AND IN CASE OF SHIPWRECK EITHER ON ROCKS OR SANDBANKS IT WILL RESIST THE HEAVIEST SEA ENDURE THE SEVEREST CONCUSSION AND WITH PROPER ATTENTION TO THE CONSTRUCTION IT MAY BE THE MEANS OF SAVING THE LIVES OF ALL ON BOARD IT MOREOVER HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF BULKHEADS WHICH MADE PERFECTLY WATERTIGHT NOT ONLY STRENGTHEN THE VESSEL BUT GIVE GREATER SECURITY TO IT AND BY A JUDICIOUS ARRANGEMENT IN THE DIVISIONS WILL FLOAT THE SHIP UNDER THE ADVERSE CIRCUMSTANCE OF A LEAK OCCURRING IN ANY ONE OF THE COMPARTMENTS THESE ARE THE QUALITIES AND POWERS OF THE IRON SHIP AND I TRUST THE PRESENT RESEARCH INTO THE STRENGTH AND PROPORTIONS OF THE MATERIAL OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED WILL NOT ONLY GIVE INCREASED CONFIDENCE IN ITS SECURITY BUT WILL LEAD TO AN EXTENSION OF ITS APPLICATION IN EVERY BRANCH OF MARINE AND MECHANICAL ARCHI TECTURE PART HI RESISTANCE OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES TO PRESSURE BY A BLUNT INSTRUMENT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE SURFACE OF THE PLATE IRRESPECTIVE OF THE EXPERIMENTS MADE TO

NAMELY THE RESISTANCE OFFERED BY PLATES TO A CRUSHING FORCE SUCH AS EXHIBITED IN THE INJURIES RECEIVED BY VESSELS WHEN STRANDED ON ROCKS OR TAKING THE GROUND IN HARBOURS WHERE THE SURFACES ARE UNEVEN

STRONGEST AND BEST MATERIAL USED FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF FIRST CLASS VESSELS WAS SELECTED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM BOTH ARE GIVEN UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES AS NEARLY SIMILAR AS THE

EXPERIMENT SHOWS THE SUPERIOR QUALITY OF WROUGHTIRON BEAMS IN GIVING TIMELY NOTICE BEFORE FRACTURE IT FURTHER EXHIBITS WEAKNESS ON THE TOP SIDES OF THE BEAMS A CIRCUMSTANCE REQUIRING GREAT ATTENTION IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION WHICH IN SOME RECENT EXPERIMENTS INSTITUTED FOR ATTAINING THE SECTION OF GREATEST STRENGTH HAVE BEEN STRIKINGLY DEVELOPED IN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS WE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO COMPARE THE STRENGTHS AS WELL AS THE WEIGHTS OF THE BEAMS OR FRAMES WHICH FORM THE RIBS OF SHIPS AS REGARDS THE STRENGTHS WITH EQUAL WEIGHTS IT IS IN FAVOUR OF OAK BUT THE CIRCUNISTANCE OF THE FASTENINGS BY RIVETS IN THE SHEATHING BEING SO MUCH SUPERIOR TO THOSE OF TIMBER THE IRON SHIPBUILDER IS ENABLED TO DISPENSE WITH ONEHALF THE NUMBER OF FRAMES AND CONSEQUENTLY A GREAT REDUCTION OF WEIGHT IS EFFECTED AND MORE STRENGTH OBTAINED IN THE VESSEL AS A WHOLE THAN COULD POSSIBLY BE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE TIMBERBUILT SHIP HOWEVER INGENIOUS THE CONSTRUCTION OR THE ARRANGEMENT AND DISTRIBUTION OF THE MATERIAL THE VERY ACT OF CAULKING THE JOINTS OF A WOODEN VESSEL HAS A TENDENCY TO LOOSEN THE FASTENINGS WHEREAS IN THE IRON SHIP THERE ARE NO ACTUAL JOINTS FOR THE WHOLE BEING BOUND TOGETHER EN MASSE THE SAME OR NEARLY THE SAME STRENGTH IS OBTAINED AS IF THE WHOLE SHIP WERE COMPOSED OF SOLID PLATES AND RIBS THE BEST SECTIONAL FORM OF BEAMS FOR THE DECKS OF SHIPS IS PROBABLY THAT EXHI BITED IN TABLE XX WHICH ALONG WITH THE BOX BEAM OF THE ANNEXED FORM FOR SUPPORTING THE SHAFTS AND PADDLEBOXES OF STEAMERS IS THAT GENERALLY USED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF VESSELS OF THIS DESCRIPTION OTHER FORMS HAVE BEEN ADOPTED PARTICULARLY THOSE SUGGESTED BY MR KENNEDY OF LIVER POOL ALLUDED TO IN THE APPENDIX  HAVING CAREFULLY INVESTIGATED THE DIFFERENT PROPERTIES OF WROUGHT IRON IN ITS VARIED FORMS OF CONSTRUCTION AND CONCEIVING THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS MAY BE USEFUL IN A VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES CONNECTED WITH THE USEFUL ARTS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO COLLECT THEM IN THE ABSTRACT IN ORDER THAT THE PRACTICAL BUILDER AND ENGINEER MAY THE MORE READILY ASCERTAIN THE COMPARATIVE VALUE OF THE DIFFERENT FORMS OF BEAMS THE PROPERTIES OF THE MATERIAL AND THEIR ADAPTATION TO ANY PARTICULAR CON STRUCTION IN WHICH HE MAY BE ENGAGED SHOULD FURTHER INFORMATION BE REQUIRED WE MUST THEN REFER TO THE EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH WILL BE FOUND THE FACTS MORE IN DETAIL AND WHICH ARE PROBABLY BETTER CALCULATED TO SATISFY THE INQUIRING MIND AND TO EFFECT THAT CONVICTION ESSENTIAL TO SUCCESS I HAVE NOT ATTEMPTED ANY INQUIRY INTO THE LAWS OF OXIDATION THE ADHESION OF BAR NACLES AND MARINE VEGETATION AND THE MEANS NECESSARY TO PREVENT SUCH EVILS THIS IS A SUBJECT WHICH DOES NOT COME WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF THE PRESENT INQUIRY AND MORE PROPERLY BELONGS TO THAT OF THE CHEMIST I WOULD HOWEVER BRIEFLY NOTICE THAT IN THE WHOLE OF MY EXPERIENCE I HAVE HAD LITTLE TO COMPLAIN OF FROM THE EFFECTS OF OXIDATION AS THAT DESTRUCTIVE PROCESS AS REGARDS IRON APPEARS TO BE GREATLY MITIGATED IF NOT ALMOST SUSPENDED BY CONSTANT USE AND UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF VIBRATORY ACTION THE OPERATION APPEARS TO BE RENDERED NUGATORY IF IT DOES NOT ENTIRELY CEASE AND THAT  SEE MY WORK ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE BRITANNIA AND CONUWAY TUBULAR BRIDGESINTO THE STRENGTH OF WROUGHTIRON PLATES 711 UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION NOT UNWORTHY THE ATTENTION OF SOMLE OF OUR BEST CHEMISTS TO WHOM THE CAUSES MAY BE KNOWN BUT WHICH ARE AT PRESENT AS FAR AS I KNOW UNACCOUNTED FOR FOR EXAMPLE I MAY MENTION THAT AN IRON SHIP IF KEPT CONSTANTLY IN USE OR NEARLY SO WILL LAST FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS EXPOSED TO ALL THE CHANGES OF WEATHER AND TEMPERATURE WITHOUT ANY SENSIBLE APPEARANCE OF DECAY THE SAME MAY BE SAID OF IRON RAILS OVER WHICH ARE PASSING DAILY SUCH ENORMOUS WEIGHTS AND AT SUCH VELOCITIES AS ALMOST TO NEU TRALIZE THE ACTION OF THE ELEMENTS ALL THESE ARE STRIKING EXAMPLES OF THE DURABILITY OF WROUGHT IRON WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF ITS SECURITY AND A RECOMMENDATION FOR ITS EXTENDED APPLICATION THERE IS ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SUBJECT TO WHICH IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THIS PLACE TO ADVERT AND THAT IS THE EFFECT WHICH A LONG CONTINUANCE IN SALT WATER HAS UPON THE HULL OF AN IRON SHIP IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT A LONG IMMERSION OF CAST IRON IN THE SEA WILL CON VERT IT INTO PLUMBAGO AND THAT A SIMILAR PROCESS WITH MALLEABLE IRON FROM ITS CONTACT WITH THE SALINE PARTICLES OF THE OCEAN PRODUCES OXIDATION AND IN CASE THE IMMERSIONS WERE LONG CONTINUED THE EFFECTS OF THIS DESTRUCTIVE PROCESS MIGHT ENDANGER THE SAFETY OF THE SHIP AS YET WE HAVE NOT HAD SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF ITS EFFECTS TO ENABLE US TO COME TO ANY DEFINITE CONCLUSION BUT IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT AN OCCASIONAL VISIT TO HARBOURS OF FRESH WATER MAY MITIGATE IF IT DOES NOT ENTIRELY NEUTRALIZE THE INJU RIOUS EFFECTS WHICH THE MATERIAL IS LIKELY TO SUSTAIN WITH THESE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I OFFER WITH DIFFIDENCE I NOW BEG TO DIRECT ATTENTION TO THE ABSTRACTS AS DEDUCED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS ABSTRACT OF RESULTS AS OBTAINEDFROM THE EXPERIMENTS IN PART I OF THIS INQUIRY WE HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW THAT 50000LBS PER SQUARE INCH IS THE MEAN BREAKING WEIGHT OF IRON PLATES WHETHER TORN ASUNDER IN THE DIREC TION OF THE FIBRE OR ACROSS IT AND WE HAVE ALSO SHOWN THAT THE TENSILE STRENGTH OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF TIMBER DRAWN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FIBRE VARIES IN A GIVEN RATIO TO THAT OF IRON THE TIMBER IN THIS COMPARISON BEING REPRESENTED BY UNITY WE HAVE THE FOLLOWING RATIO OF STRENGTH TIMBER IRON ASH AS1  294 TEAK AS 1  333 FIR AS 1  416 BEECH AS I  434 OAK AS     1  500 THESE FOR PRACTICAL PURPOSES MAY BE TAKEN AS A FAIR MEASURE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE DIFFERENT WOODS AS COMPARED WITH THAT OF IRON PLATES IT HAS BEEN SHOWN THAT WROUGHTIRON PLATES WHEN RIVETED TOGETHER LOSE A CONSI DERABLE PORTION OF THEIR STRENGTH AS MAV BE SEEN BY THE EXPERIMENTS IN PART IV WHERE THE PLATES BY THEIR UNION WITH EACH OTHER LOSE BY THE ORDINARY PROCESS OF RIVETING 44 PER CENT AND BY THE BEST MODE OF RIVETING 30 PER CENT THIS SHOULD NOT HOWEVER712 MR FAIRBAIRNS EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY CREATE SERIOUS ALARM AS THE LOSS OF STRENGTH IS ALMOST ENTIRELY OBVIATED BY THE NEW PRO CESS OF RIVETING USED IN THE BOTTOM OF THE BRITANNIA AND CONWAY TUBULAR BRIDGES AND IT SHOULD ALSO BE OBSERVED THAT IN TIMBER THE SAME INJURIES ARE SUSTAINED BY SPLICING OR ANY OTHER METHOD OF FORMING THE JOINTS AS ARE HERE EXHIBITED IN THE RIVET ING OF IRON PLATES THE TWO PROCESSES THAT OF RIVETING ACCORDING TO THE METHOD USED IN THE EXPERIMENTS AND SPLICING WHEN INTENDED TO RESIST A TENSILE STRAIN MUST THEREFORE BE CONSIDERED ANALOGOUS AND THE COMPARISON UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES WILL NEARLY FOLLOW THE SAME LAW AS REGARDS A DIMINUTION OF STRENGTH IN THIS SECTION OF THE INQUIRY THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS INDICATE A LOSS IN THE JOINTS AS COMPARED WITH THE SOLID PLATE AS THE NUMBERS 100 70 AND 56 VIZ FOR THE SOLID PLATE 100 FOR THE DOUBLERIVETED JOINT    70 FOR THE SINGLERIVETED JOINT    56 WHICH NUMBERS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS A FAIR AVERAGE VALUE OF THE STRENGTHS OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF VESSELS CONSTRUCTED IN THIS MANNER PART V EXHIBITS THE STRENGTH OF PLATES TO RESIST VERTICAL PRESSURE FROM A BLUNT IN STRUMENT WHICH WAS FORCED THROUGH THEM FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASCERTAINING THEIR COM PARATIVE

THEIR RESISTANCE TO PRESSURE TO THAT OF OAK THE STRENGTH BEING AS THE DEPTH OR THICKNESS OF THE PLATES IN THE FIRST CASE AND AS THE SQUARES OF THE DEPTH IN THE SECOND THE RESISTANCES ARETHEREFORE ILL THE RATIO OF 1  12 THE IRON BEING 12 TIMES STRONGER THAN OAK IN PART IV WE HAVE SOME CURIOUS FACTS ILLUSTRATIVE OF THE NECESSITY AND VALUE OF EX PERIMENTAL RESEARCH IN THE EARLIER EXPERIMENTS OF THE INQUIRY IT IS EVIDENT THAT ANGLE AND T IRON BEAMS OR FRAMES ARE NOT THE BEST AS REGARDS FORM TO RESIST A TRANSVERSE STRAIN IN EVERY CASE THEY ARE WEAK AND ALTHOUGH EXCEEDINGLY USEFUL AND IN FACT INDISPENSABLE FOR MANY PURPOSES OF CONSTRUCTION THEY ARE NEVERTHELESS NOT CALCULATED TO RESIST STRAIN IN THE FORM OF BEAMS OR GIRDERS THESE DEFECTS I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO OBVIATE BY THE INTRODUCTION OF

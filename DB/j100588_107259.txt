J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107259,ON PLATINA AND NATIVE PALLADIUM FROM BRASIL,I206964,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSAC TIONS X ON PLATINA AND NATIVE PALLADIUM FROM BRASIL BY WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON M D SEC R S READ MARCH 22 1809 HALTHOUGH PLATINA HAS NOW BEEN KNOWN TO MINERALOGISTS FOR MORE THAN SIXTY YEARS YET IT HAD NOT BEEN DISCOVERED IN ANY OTHER PLACES THAN CHOCO AND SANTA FE WHENCE IT WAS ORIGI NALLY BROUGHT UNTIL ABOUT TWO YEARS SINCE M VAUQUELIN DIS COVERED IT IN SOME GRAY SILVER ORES FROM GUADALCANAL IN ESTREMADURA IN ANALYSING THESE ORES HE FOUND SOME FRAG MENTS THAT CONTAINED AS MUCH AS ONE TENTH OF THEIR WEIGHT OF PLATINA BUT HE DID NOT FIND IT ACCOMPANIED BY ANY OF THE NEW METALS THAT HAVE LATELY BEEN DISCOVERED IN THE PERUVIAN ORE OF PLATINA THE SPECIMEN WHICH I AM NOW ABOUT TO DESCRIBE IS DERIVED FROM A THIRD SOURCE AND IT IS RENDERED THE MORE INTERESTING BY HAVING GRAINS OF NATIVE PALLADIUM MIXED WITH IT THIS NEW MINERAL HAS LATELY BEEN RECEIVED FROM THE GOLD MINES IN BRASIL BY H E CHEV DE SOUZA COUTINHO AMBASSADOR FROM THE COURT OF PORTUGAL RESIDENT IN THIS COUNTRY AND I AM IN MDCCCIX C CDR WOLLASTON ON PLATINA HOPES THAT SOME ACCOUNT OF IT MAY BE ACCEPTABLE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY ALTHOUGH THE ANALYSIS MUST NECESSARILY BE VERY IM PERFECT FROM THE SMALL QUANTITY TO WHICH MY EXPERIMENTS HAVE UNAVOIDABLY BEEN CONFINED THE GENERAL ASPECT OF THIS SPECIMEN IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE COMMON ORE OF PLATINA THAT I COULD FORM NO CONJECTURE OF WHAT INGREDIENTS IT MIGHT BE FOUND TO CONSIST ITS APPEARANCE WAS SUCH INDEED AS AT FIRST SIGHT TO INDUCE A SUSPICION OF ITS NOT BEING IN A NATURAL STATE FOR IT HAD VERY MUCH THE SPONGY FORM WHICH IS GIVEN TO PLATINA FROM IMPERFECT ATTEMPTS TO RENDER IT MALLEABLE BY MEANS OF ARSENIC ONE CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER OCCASIONS A PRESUMPTION THAT NO ART HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN GIVING THE GRAINS THEIR PRESENT APPEARANCE AS UPON CLOSE INSPECTION MANY SMALL PARTICLES OF GOLD ARE DISCERNIBLE BUT THERE IS NONE OF THE MAGNETIC IRON SAND WITH WHICH THE PERUVIAN ORE ABOUNDS NOR ANY OF THE SMALL HYACINTHS WHICH I HAVE FORMERLY NOTICED AS ACCOMPANY ING THAT MINERAL IT IS VERY WELL KNOWN THAT THE COMMON ORE OF PLATINA IN GE TNERAL CONSISTS OF FLATTENED GRAINS THAT APPEAR SO MUCH WORN AT THEIR SURFACE AS TO BE IN A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE POLISHED AND THE ROUGHNESS OBSERVABLE IN SOME OF THE LARGER GRAINS ARISES FROM CONCAVE INDENTATIONS OF A REDDISH BROWN OR BLACK COLOUR THE BRASILIALL PLATINA ON THE CONTRARY HAS NO POLISH AND DOES NOT APPEAR WORN BUT MOST OF THE GRAINS SEEM TO BE SMALL FRAG MENTS OF A SPONGY SUBSTANCE AND EVEN THESE WHICH ARE YET ENTIRE AND ROUNDED ON ALL SIDES PRESENT A SORT OF ROUGHNESS TOTALLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE FORMER AS THEIR SURFACE CON SISTS OF SMALL SPHERICAL PROTUBERANCES CLOSELY COHERENT TO EACH  PHIL TRANS FOR 1SO5 P 38 I9AND NATIVE PALLADIZUM FROM BRASIL 11G OTHER WITH THE INTERSTICES EXTREMELY CLEAN AND FREE FROM ANY DEGREE OF TARNISH THE FIRST PORTION THAT I EMPLOYED FOR SOLUTION WAS TAKEN WITHOUT ANY SELECTION AND BEING DIGESTED WITH A SMALL QUAN TITY OF NITROMURIATIC ACID TWO OF THE GRAINS WERE ACTED ON MUCH MORE RAPICILY THAN IS USUAL WITH PLATINA AND SEEMED TO GIVE A REDDER COLOUR THAN THAT METAL ALONE THESE GRAINS WERE CONSEQUENTLY TAKEN OUT WASHED AND RESERVED FOR SEPA RATE EXAMINATION AND THE SOLUTION WAS ALLOWED TO PROCEED TILL THE REST WERE ENTIRELY DISSOLVED BY THE ADDITION OF MURIATE OF AMMONIA AN ABUNDANT PRECIPITATE WAS FORMED OF A BRIGHT YELLOW COLOUR THIS PRECIPITATE WAS EVIDENTLY PLATINA AND ITS COLOUR SATISFIED ME THAT THE GRAINS HAD NOT BEEN BROUGHT INTO THEIR PRESENT STATE FROM PERUVIAN PLATINA BY MEANS OF ARSENIC FOR WHERE ARSENIC HAS BEEN EMPLOYED I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE IRIDIUM CONTAINED IN THAT ORE IS RENDERED MORE SOLUBLE THAN BEFORE AND THENCE COMMUNICATES ITS RED COLOUR TO THE PRECIPITATE FROM THE GRAINS THUS EXAMINED THERE APPEARED NOT TO BE ANY IRIDIUM DISSOLVED NOR ANY BLACK POWDER CONTAINING IRI DIUM UNDISSOLVED I NEXT ENDEAVOURED BY PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY TO ASCERTAIN THE PRESENCE OF PALLADIUM BUT THOUGH A PRECIPITATE WHICH OCCURRED INDICATED A CERTAIN QUANTITY IT REMAINED DOUBTFUL WHETHER IT WAS DERIVED FROM THE GRAINS OF PLATINA THEMSELVES OR FROM THE TWO SMALL FRAGMENTS THAT HAD BEEN IN PART DIS SOLVED BEFORE THEY WERE SEPARATED FROM THE REST BY ADDITION OF AMMONIA TO THE SOLUTION NO IRON WAS PRECI PITATED AND WHEN THE SOLUTION WAS AFTERWARDS ALLOWED SLOWLY TO EVAPORATE I COULD DISCERN NO CRYSTALS OR COLOUR THAT I COULD CCDR WOLLASTON ON PLATINA ASCRIBE TO THE PRESENCE OF RHODIUM IN SHORT IT SEEMED THAT THESE GRAINS ARE REALLY NATIVE PLATINA NEARLY PURE IN ORDER TO DISCOVER WHETHER THE GRAINS THEMSELVES CON TAINED ANY PORTION OF GOLD I SELECTED THREE OF THE LARGEST WEIGHING TOGETHER EIGHT GRAINS AND A HALF AND AFTER A SOLU TION AND PRECIPITATION AS BEFORE BY MURIATE OF AMMONIA I ADDED A SOLUTION OF GREEN SULPHATE OF IRON AND OBTAINED A PRECIPITATE OF GOLD IT WAS HOWEVER FAR TOO SMALL IN QUAN TITY TO BE ESTIMATED WITH CORRECTNESS BUT CERTAINLY DID NOT EXCEED THE O OF A GRAIN THIS IT IS TO BE OBSERVED IS AN OTHER CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH THE PRESENT MINERAL DIFFERS FROM THE PERUVIAN ORE OF PLATINA WHICH I BELIEVE NEVER CONTAINS IN THE ORE ITSELF THE SMALLEST QUANTITY OF GOLD IN THIS EXPERIMENIT ALSO I TRIED TO DETECT THE EXISTENCE OF PALLADIUM IN THE SOLUTION AND BY PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY AGAIN ASCERTAINED ITS PRESENCE BUT IT WAS IN TOO SMALL QUANTITY FOR ESTIMATING THE PROPORTION IT BORE TO THE WHOLE MASS IT MAY DESERVE TO BE REMARKED THAT THOUGH NEITHER THE PERUVIAN NOR BRASILIAN GRAINS OF PLATINA CONTAIN ANY SILVER YET THE GOLD WHICH ACCOMPANIES THEM IS IN EACH INSTANCE SO MUCH ALLOYED WITH SILVER THAT FROM ABOUT THIRTY SMALL SCALES OF GOLD PICKED FROM PERUVIAN PLATINA WEIGHING TWO GRAINS I OBTAINED AS MUCH AS FOUR TENTHS OF A GRAIN OF SILVER OR ONE FIFTH PART OF THEIR WEIGHT NATIVE PALLADIUM THE TWO FRAGMENTS THAT HAD BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE FIRST SOLUTION NEXT CLAIMED MY ATTENTION AND EVIDENTLY DESERVED A CAREFUL EXAMINATION THEY WERE EACH PLACED IN A DROP OF NITRIC ACID AND EACH COMMUNICATED A DEEP RED COLOUR WHICH 19AND NATIVE PALLADIUM FROM BRASIL BY THE TESTS OF PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY AND GREEN SULPHATE OF IRON I WAS SATISFIED AROSE FROM PALLADIUM THE SMALLER FRAG MENT WAS THEN DIVIDED AND ONE PORTION ALLOWED TO REMAIN IN THE ACID TILL IT SEEMED COMPLETELY DISSOLVED AND THE OTHER EX AMINED BY THE BLOWPIPE THE UTMOST HEAT THAT COULD BE GIVEN APPEARED TO HAVE NO EFFECT BUT WHEN A SMALL PIECE OF SULPHUR WA APPLIED TO IT IT FUSED INSTANTLY BY CONTINUANCE OF THE HEAT IT PARTED WITH THE SULPHUR AND BECAME COMPLETELY MALLEABLE IN SHORT IT PERFECTLY RESEMBLED PALLADIUM AND AS IT RETAINED ITS BRILLIANCY IN COOLING I JUDGED IT TO BE NEARLY PURE BUT AS THE SURFACES WHICH HAD BEEN ACTED UPON BY NITRIC ACID HAD A DEGREE OF BLACKNESS THAT MIGHT BE OWING TO SOME INSOLUBLE IMPURITY I HAVE SINCE THAT TIME DISSOLVED THE LARGER FRAGMENT FOR THE SAKE OF DISCOVERING THE CAUSE OF THIS APPEARANCE HOT NITRIC ACID DISSOLVED BY FAR THE GREATEST PART BUT THERE REMAINED A BLACK POWDER ON WHICH A FRESH ADDITION OF THIS ACID ALONE HAD NO FURTHER EFFECT BUT WHEN A DROP OR TWO OF MURIA TIC ACID WAS ADDED THE WHOLE WAS VERY SOON DISSOLVED BY THE ADDITION OF MURIATE OF AMMONIA IT BECAME EVIDENT FROM THE PRECIPITATE THAT THE RESIDUUM WAS PRINCIPALLY PLATINA BUT THIS PRECIPITATE INSTEAD OF BEING YELLOW HAD THE DEEP RED COLOUR WHICH IS USUALLY OCCASIONED BY THE PRESENCE OF IRIDIUM THE PLATINA REDUCED FROM THIS PRECIPITATE WAS ALSO TOO BLACK FOR PURE PLATINA AND WHEN IT WAS AGAIN DISSOLVED THE SOLUTION WAS OF A DEEP RED AND THE PRECIPITATE BY MURIATE OF AMMONIA RED AS BEFORE SO THAT ALTHOUGH THE GRAINS OF BRASILIAN PLA TINA APPEAR TO BE FREE FROM IRIDIUM AS WELL AS FROM MANY OTHER IMPURITIES THAT FORM PART OF THE PERUVIAN ORE YET THE GRAINS OF NATIVE PALLADIUM THAT ACCOMPANY THEM AFFORD A TRACE 195DR WOLLASTON ON PATIA C OF THIS INGREDIENT AND OCCASION A PRESUMPTION THAT OSMIUM AND RHODIUM MAY HEREAFTER APPEAR WHEN WE CAN OBTAIN THIS MINERAL IN LARGER QUANTITY SINCE THE WHOLE WEIGHT OF METAL EMPLOYED IN THE LAST EX PERIMENT DID NOT EXCEED 1 GRAIN IT IS IN VAIN TO ATTEMPT TO ESTIMATE THE PROPORTION OF THE INGREDIENTS BUT IF I AM NEAR THE TRUTH IN CONSIDERING THE QUANTITY OF THE RED PRECIPITATE AS ABOUT ONE FIFTH OF A GRAIN OF WHICH LESS THAN HALF IS PLATINA THOSE WHO ARE BEST ACQUAINTED WITH THE INTENSE COLOURING POWER OF IRIDIUM MAY ENDEAVOUR TO FORM A CONCEPTION OF THE EXTREMELY SMALL QUANTITY THAT CAN BE PRESENT AS SOON AS I HAD ASCERTAINED THE EXISTENCE OF NATIVE PALLA DIUM I ENDEAVOURED BY EXAMINATION OF ITS EXTERNAL CHARACTERS TO DISTINGUISH ITS APPEARANCE FROM THAT OF THE SURROUNDING SUBSTANCES AND I FOUND IT BY NO MIEANS DIFFICULT ALTHOUGH NO DIFFERENCE OF COLOUR COULD BE DISCERNED HAVING REMARKED THAT THE LARGER FRAGMENT APPEARED RATHER FIBROUS AND THAT THE FIBRES WERE IN SOME DEGREE DIVERGENT FROM ONE EXTREMITY I EXAMINED THE REMAINDER OF THE SMALL SPECIMEN WHICH HAD ORIGINALLY BEEN GIVEN TO ME AND BY THIS PECULIARITY OF STRUC TURE I SOON DETECTED A THIRD FRAGMENT WHICH UPON TRIAL PROVED TO BE THE SAME SUBSTANCE BY FAVOUR OF THE CHEV DE SOUZA I WAS ALSO PERMITTED WITH THIS VIEW TO EXAMINE THE SPECIMEN WHICH REMAINED IN HIS POSSESSION AND HAD SOON THE SATISFAC TION OF DISCOVERING TWO MORE FRAGMENTS OF THE SAME MINERAL AND AS I WAS IN NO OLE INSTANCE DECEIVED IN MY CHOICE BY ATTENDING TO THE RADIATING FIBRES I AM IN HOPES THAT THIS EX TERNAL CHARACTER WILL ENABLE PERSONS TO DISTINGUISH THAT METAL IN SITUATIONS WHERE THEY HAVE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY OF DECIDING BY CHEMICAL EXPERIMENT

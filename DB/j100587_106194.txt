HOUSESWALLOW SWIFT AND SANDMARTIN BY THE REV GILBERT WHITE IN THREE LETTERS TO THE HON DAINES BARRINGTON F R S L E T T E R I O F T H E H O U S ES W A L L O W DEAR SIR SELBORNE JAN 29 1775 THE HOUSESWALLOW OR CHIMNEYSWAL LOW IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE FIRST COMER OF ALL THE BRITISH HIRUNDINES AND APPEARS IN GENERAL ON OR ABOUT THE 13TH OF APRIL AS I HAVE REMARKED FROM MANY YEARS OBSERVATION NOT BUT NOW AND THEN A STRAGGLER IS SEEN MUCH EARLIER AND IN PARTICULAR WHEN I WAS A BOY I OBSERVED A SWALLOW FOR A WHOLE DAY TOGETHER ON A SUNNY WARM SHROVETUESDAY WHICH DAY COULD NOT FALL OUT LATER THAN THE MIDDLE OF MARCH AND OFTEN HAPPENS EARLY IN FEBRUARY IT IS WORTH REMARKING THAT THESE BIRDS ARE SEEN FIRST ABOUT LAKES AND MILLPONDS AND IT IS ALSO VERY PARTICULAR THAT IF THESE EARLY VISITORS HAPPEN TO FIND FROST AND SNOW AS WAS THE CASE IN THE TWO DREADFUL SPRINGS OF 1770 AND 1771 THEY IMMEDIATELY WITHDRAW FOR A TIME A CIRCUMSTANCE THIS MUCH MORE IN FAVOUR  SEE AN ACCOUNT OF THE HOUSEMARTIN BY THE SAME GENTLEMAN IN PHIL TRANS VOL LXIV P 196 OF REDDE MAR 16 1775259 HIDING THAN MIGRATION SINCE IT IS MUCH MORE PROBABLE THAT A BIRD SHOULD RETIRE TO ITS HYBERNACULUM JUST AT HAND THAN RETURN FOR A WEEK OR TWO ONLY TO WARMER LATITUDES THIS SWALLOW THOUGH CALLED THE CHIMNEYSWALLOW BY NO MEANS BUILDS ALTOGETHER IN CHIMNEYS BUT OFTEN WITH IN BARNS AND OUTHOUSES AGAINST THE RAFTERS AND SO SHE DID IN VIRGILS TIME   ANTE  GARRULA QUAM TIGNIS NIDOS SUSPENDAT HIRUNDO IN SWEDEN SHE BUILDS IN BARNS AND IS CALLED LADU SWALA THE BARNSWALLOW BESIDES IN THE WARMER PARTS OF EU ROPE THERE ARE NO CHIMNEYS TO HOUSES EXCEPT THEY ARE ENGLISHBUILT IN THESE COUNTRIES SHE CONSTRUCTS HER NEST IN PORCHES AND GATEWAYS GOLLERIES AND OPEN HALLS HERE AND THERE A BIRD MAY AFFECT SOME ODD PECULIAR PLACE AS WE HAVE KNOWN A SWALLOW BUILD DOWN THE SHAFT OF AN OLD WELL THROUGH WHICH CHALK WAS FORMERLY DRAWN UP FOR THE PURPOSES OF MANURE BUT IN GENERAL WITH US THIS BIRUNDO BREEDS IN CHIMNEYS AND LOVES TO HAUNT THOSE STACKS WHERE THERE IS A CONSTANT FIRE NO DOUBT FOR THE SAKE OF WARMTH NOT THAT IT CAN SUBSIST IN THE IMMEDI ATE SHAFT WHERE THERE IS A FIRE BUT PREFERS ONE ADJOINING TO THAT OF THE KITCHEN AND DISREGARDS THE PERPETUAL SMOKE OF THAT FUNNEL AS I HAVE OFTEN OBSERVED WITH SOME DEGREE OF WONDER FIVE OR SIX OR MORE FEET DOWN THE CHIMNEY DOES THIS LITTLE BIRD BEGIN TO FORM HER NEST ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF MAY WHICH CONSISTS LIKE THAT OF THE HOUSE MARTIN OF A CRUST OR SHELL COMPOSED OF DIRT AND MUD MIXED WITH SHORT PIECES OF STRAW TO RENDER IT TOUGH AND PERMANENT260 PERMANENT WITH THIS DIFFERENCE THAT WHEREAS THE SHELL OF THE MARTIN IS NEARLY HEMISPHERIC THAT OF THE SWALLOW IS OPEN AT THE TOP AND LIKE HALF A DEEP DISH THIS NEST IS LINED WITH FINE GRASSES AND FEATHERS WHICH ARE OFTEN COL LECTED AS THEY FLOAT IN THE AIR WONDERFUL IS THE AD DRESS WHICH THIS ADROIT BIRD SHEWS ALL DAY LONG IN ASCEND ING AND DESCENDING WITH SECURITY THROUGH SO NARROW A PASS WHEN HOVERING OVER THE MOUTH OF THE FUNNEL THE VIBRATIONS OF HER WINGS ACTING ON THE CONFINED AIR OCCASION A RUMBLING LIKE THUNDER IT IS NOT IMPROBABLE THAT THE DAM SUBMITS TO THIS INCONVENIENT SITUATION SO LOW IN THE SHAFT IN ORDER TO SECURE HER BROODS FROM RA PACIOUS BIRDS AND PARTICULARLY FROM OWLS WHICH FRE QUENTLY FALL DOWN CHIMNIES PERHAPS IN ATTEMPTING TO GET AT THESE NESTLINGS THE SWALLOW LAYS FROM FOUR TO SIX WHITE EGGS DOTTED WITH RED SPECKS AND BRINGS OUT HER FIRST BROOD ABOUT THE LAST WEEK IN JUNE OR THE FIRST WEEK IN JULY THE PROGRESSIVE METHOD BY WHICH THE YOUNG ARE INTRODUCED INTO LIFE IS VERY AMUSING FIRST THEY EMERGE FROM THE SHAFT WITH DIFFICULTY ENOUGH AND OFTEN FALL DOWN INTO THE ROOMS BELOW FOR A DAY OR SO THEY ARE FED ON THE CHIMNEYTOP AND THEN ARE CONDUCTED TO THE DEAD LEAFLESS BOUGH OF SOME TREE WHERE SITTING IN A ROW THEY ARE ATTENDED WITH GREAT ASSIDUITY AND MAY THEN BE CALLED PERCHERS IN A DAY OR TWO MORE THEY BECOME FLYERS BUT ARE STILL UNABLE TO TAKE THEIR OWN FOOD THERE FORE THEY PLAY ABOUT NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THE DAMS ARE HAWKING FOR FLIES AND WHEN A MOUTHFUL IS COLLECTED AT A CERTAIN SIGNAL GIVEN THE DAM AND THE NESTLING ADVANCE RISING261 RISING TOWARDS EACH OTHER AND MEETING AT AN ANGLE AND THE YOUNG ONE ALL THE WHILE UTTERING SUCH A LITTLE QUICK NOTE OF GRATITUDE AND COMPLACENCY THAT A PERSON MUST HAVE PAID VERY LITTLE REGARD TO THE WONDERS OF NATURE THAT HAS NOT OFTEN REMARKED THIS FEAT THE DAM BETAKES HERSELF IMMEDIATELY TO THE BUSINESS OF A SECOND BROOD AS SOON AS SHE IS DISENGAGED FROM HER FIRST WHICH AT ONCE ASSOCIATES WITH THE FIRST BROODS OF HOUSEMARTINS AND WITH THEM CONGREGATES CLUSTERING ON SUNNY ROOFS TOW ERS AND TREES THIS HIRUNDO BRINGS OUT HER SECOND BROOD TOWARDS THE MIDDLE AND END OF AUGUST ALL THE SUM MER LONG IS THE SWALLOW A MOST INSTRUCTIVE PATTERN OF UN WEARIED INDUSTRY AND AFFECTION FOR FROM MORNING TO NIGHT WHILE THERE IS A FAMILY TO BE SUPPORTED SHE SPENDS THE WHOLE DAY IN SKIMMING CLOSE TO THE GROUND AND EXERTING THE MOST SUDDEN TURNS AND QUICK EVOLUTIONS AVENUES AND LONG WALKS UNDER HEDGES PASTURE FIELDS AND MOWN MEADOWS WHERE CATTLE GRAZE ARE HER DELIGHT ESPECIALLY IF THERE ARE TREES INTERSPERSED BECAUSE IN SUCH SPOTS INSECTS MOST ABOUND WHEN A FLY IS TAKEN A SMART SNAP FROM HER BILL IS HEARD RESEMBLING THE NOISE AT THE SHUTTING OF A WATCHCASE BUT THE MOTION OF THE MANDI BLES IS TOO QUICK FOR THE EYE THE SWALLOW PROBABLY THE MALE BIRD IS THE EXCUBITOR TO THE HOUSEMARTINS AND OTHER LITTLE BIRDS ANNOUNCING THE APPROACH OF BIRDS OF PREY FOR AS SOON AS AN HAWK APPEARS WITH A SHRILL ALARM ING NOTE HE CALLS ALL THE SWALLOWS AND MARTINS ABOUT HIM WHO PURSUE IN A BODY WHILST THEY BUFFET AND STRIKE THEIR ENEMY TILL THEY HAVE DRIVEN HIM FROM THE VILLAGE DART ING262 ING DOWN FROM ABOVE ON HIS BACK AND RISING IN A PER PENDICULAR LINE IN PERFECT SECURITY THIS BIRD ALSO WILL SOUND THE ALARM AND STRIKE AT CATS WHEN THEY CLIMB ON THE ROOFS OF HOUSES OR OTHERWISE APPROACH THEIR NESTS EACH SPECIES OF BIRUNDO DRINKS AS IT FLIES ALONG SIPPING THE SURFACE OF THE WATER BUT THE SWALLOW ALONE WASHES ON THE WING BY DROPPING INTO A POOL FOR MANY TIMES TOGETHER THE SWALLOW IS A DELICATE SONGSTER AND IN SOFT WEATHER FINGS BOTH PERCHING ON TREES AND ON CHIM NEY TOPS AND FLYING IS ALSO A BOLD RANGER TO DISTANT DOWNS AND COMMONS EVEN IN WINDY WEATHER WHICH THE OTHER SPECIES SEEM MUCH TO DISLIKE NAY EVEN FREQUENT ING EXPOSED SEAPORT TOWNS AND MAKING LITTLE EXCURSIONS OVER THE SALTWATER HORSEMEN ON WIDE DOWNS ARE OFTEN CLOSELY ATTENDED BY A LITTLE PARTY OF SWALLOWS FOR MILES TOGETHER WHICH PLAYS BEFORE AND BEHIND THEM SWEEPING AROUND AND COLLECTING ALL THE SKULKING INSECTS THAT ARE ROUSED BY THE TRAMPLING OF THE HORSES FEET WHEN THE WIND BLOWS HARD WITHOUT THIS EXPEDIENT THEY ARE OFTEN FORCED TO SETTLE TO PICK UP THEIR LURKING PREY THIS SPECIES FEEDS MUCH ON LITTLE COLEOPTERA AS WELL AS ON GRASS AND FLIES AND OFTEN SETTLES ON DUG GROUNDS FOR GRA VEL TO GRIND AND DIGEST ITS FOOD BEFORE THEY DEPART FOR SOME WEEKS TO A BIRD THEY FORSAKE HOUSES AND CHIM NIES AND ROOST IN TREES AND USUALLY WITHDRAW ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF OCTOBER THOUGH SOME FEW STRAGGLERS MAY APPEAR AT TIMES TO THE FIRST WEEK IN NOVEMBER SOME FEW PAIRS HAUNT THE NEW AND OPEN STREETS OF LONDON NEXT THE FIELDS BUT DO NOT ENTER LIKE THE HOUSEMARTINS THE263 THE CLOSE AND CROWDED PARTS OF THE CITY BOTH MALE AND FEMALE ARE DISTINGUISHED FROM THEIR CONGENERS BY THE LENGTH AND FORKEDNESS OF THEIR TAILS THEY ARE UN DOUBTEDLY THE MOST NIMBLE OF ALL THE SPECIES AND WHEN THE MALE PURSUES THE FEMALE IN AMOROUS CHACE THEY THEN GO BEYOND THEIR USUAL SPEED AND EXERT A RAPIDITY ALMOST TOO QUICK FOR THE EYE TO FOLLOW AFTER THIS CIRCUMSTANTIAL DETAIL OF THE LIFE AND DISCERN ING  OF THE SWALLOW I SHALL ADD FOR YOUR FARTHER AMUSEMENT AN ANECDOTE OR TWO NOT MUCH IN FAVOUR OF HER SAGACITY A CERTAIN SWALLOW BUILT FOR TWO YEARS TOGETHER ON THE HANDLES OF A PAIR OF GARDENSHEERS THAT WERE STUCK UP AGAINST THE BOARDS IN AN OUTHOUSE AND WHAT IS STRANGER STILL ANOTHER BIRD OF THE SAME SPECIES BUILT ITS NEST ON THE WINGS AND BODY OF AN OWL THAT HAP PENED BY ACCIDENT TO HANG DEAD AND DRY FROM THE RAFTER OF A BARN THIS OWL WITH THE NEST ON ITS WINGS AND WITH EGGS IN THE NEST WAS BROUGHT AS A CURIOSITY WORTHY THE MOST ELEGANT PRIVATE MUSEUM IN GREAT BRITAIN THE OWNER STRUCK WITH THE ODDITY OF THE SIGHT FURNISHED THE BRINGER WITH A LARGE SHELL OR CONCH DESIRING HIM TO FIX IT JUST WHERE THE OWL HUNG THE PERSON DID AS HE WAS ORDERED AND THE FOLLOWING YEAR A PAIR PROBABLY THE SAME PAIR BUILT THEIR NEST IN THE CONCH AND LAID THEIR EGGS THE OWL AND THE CONCH MAKE A STRANGE GROTESQUE APPEARANCE AND ARE NOT THE LEAST CURIOUS SPECIMENS IN THAT WONDERFUL COLLECTION OF ART AND NATURE THUS IS INSTINCT IN ANIMALS TAKEN THE LEAST OUT OF ITS WAY AN UNDISTINGUISHING LIMITED FACULTY AND BLIND TO V O L LXV O O EVERY264 EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY RESPECT SELFPRESERVATION OR LEAD AT ONCE TO THE PROPAGATION OR SUPPORT OF THEIR SPECIES I AM WITH ALL RESPECT C L E T T E R II OF THE SWIFT OR BLACK MARTIN DEAR SIR SELBORNE SEPT 28 1774 AS THE SWIFT OR BLACK MARTIN IS THE LARGEST OF THE BRITISH HIRUNDINES SO IT IS UNDOUBTEDLY THE LATEST COMER FOR I REMEMBER BUT ONE INSTANCE OF ITS APPEARING BEFOR THE LAST WEEK IN APRIL AND IN SOME OF OUR LATE FROSTY HARSH SPRINGS IT HAS NOT BEEN SEEN TILL THE BEGIN NING OF MAY THIS SPECIES USUALLY ARRIVES IN PAIRS THE SWIFT LIKE THE SANDMARTIN IS VERY DEFECTIVE IN ARCHITECTURE MAKING NO CRUST OR SHELL FOR ITS NEST BUT FORMING IT OF DRY GRASSES AND FEATHERS VERY RUDELY AND INARTIFICIALLY PUT TOGETHER WITH ALL MY ATTENTION TO THESE BIRDS I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER ONE IN THE ACT OF COLLECTING OR CARRYING IN MATERIALS SO THAT I HAVE SUSPECTED SINCE THEIR NESTS ARE EXACTLY THE SAME THAT THEY SOMETIMES USURP UPON THE HOUSESPARROWS AND EX PEL THEM AS SPARROWS DO THE HOUSE AND SANDMARTIN WELL REMEMBERING THAT I HAVE SEEN THEM SQUABBLING TO GETHER265 GETHER AT THE ENTRANCE OF THEIR HOLES AND THE SPARROWS UP IN ARMS AND MUCH DISCONCERTED AT THESE INTRUDERS AND YET I AM ASSURED BY A NICE OBSERVER IN SUCH MATTERS THAT THEY DO COLLECT FEATHERS FOR THEIR NESTS IN ANDALUSIA AND THAT HE HAS SHOT THEM WITH SUCH MATERIALS IN THEIR MOUTHS SWIFTS LIKE SANDMARTINS CARRY ON THE BU SINESS OF NIDIFICATION QUITE IN THE DARK IN CRANNIES OF TOWERS AND STEEPLES AND UPON THE TOPS OF THE WALLS OF CHURCHES UNDER THE ROOF AND THEREFORE CANNOT BE SO NARROWLY WATCHED AS THOSE SPECIES THAT BUILD MORE OPENLY BUT FROM WHAT I COULD EVER OBSERVE THEY BEGIN NESTING ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF MAY AND I HAVE REMARKED FROM EGGS TAKEN THAT THEY HAVE SAT HARD BY THE NINTH OF JUNE IN GENERAL THEY HAUNT HIGH BUILDINGS CHURCHES AND STEE PLES AND BUILD ONLY IN SUCH YET IN THIS VILLAGE SOME PAIRS FREQUENT THE LOWEST AND MEANEST COTTAGES AND EDU CATE THEIR YOUNG UNDER THOSE THATCHED ROOFS WE RE MEMBER BUT ONE INSTANCE WHERE THEY BRED OUT OF BUILD INGS AND THAT IS IN THE SIDES OF A DEEP CHALKPIT NEAR THE TOWN OF ODIHAM IN THIS COUNTY WHERE WE HAVE SEEN MANY PAIRS ENTERING THE CREVICES AND SKIMMING AND SQUEAKING ROUND THE PRECIPICES AS I HAVE REGARDED THESE AMUSIVE BIRDS WITH GREAT ATTENTION IF I SHOULD AD VANCE SOMETHING NEW AND PECULIAR WITH RESPECT TO THEM AND DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER BIRDS I MIGHT PERHAPS BE CREDITED ESPECIALLY AS MY ASSERTION IS THE RESULT OF MANY YEARS EXACT OBSERVATION THE FACT THAT I WOULD ADVANCE IS THAT SWIFTS TREAD OR COPULATE ON THE WING AND I COULD  VIZ HAMPSHIRE O O 2 WISH266 WISH ANY NICE OBSERVER THAT IS STARTLED AT THIS SUPPOSITION TO USE HIS OWN EYES AND I THINK HE WILL SOON BE CON VINCED IN ANOTHER CLASS OF ANIMALS VIDELICET THE INSECT NOTHING IS SO COMMON AS TO SEE THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF MANY GENERA IN CONJUNCTION AS THEY FLY THE SWIFT IS ALMOST CONTINUALLY ON THE WING AND AS IT NEVER SETTLES ON THE GROUND ON TREES OR ROOFS WOULD SELDOM FIND OP PORTUNITY FOR AMOROUS RITES WAS IT NOT ENABLED TO INDULGE THEM IN THE AIR IF ANY PERSON WOULD WATCH THESE BIRDS ON A FINE MORNING IN MAY AS THEY ARE SAILING ROUND AT A GREAT HEIGHT FROM THE GROUND HE WOULD SEE EVERY NOW AND THEN ONE DROP ON THE BACK OF ANOTHER AND BOTH OF THEM SINK DOWN TOGETHER FOR MANY FATHOMS WITH A LOUD PIERCING SHRIEK THIS I TAKE TO BE THE JUNCTURE WHEN THE BUSINESS OF GENERATION IS CARRYING ON AS THE SWIFT EATS DRINKS COLLECTS MATERIALS FOR ITS NEST AND AS IT SEEMS PROPAGATES ON THE WING IT APPEARS TO LIVE MORE IN THE AIR THAN ANY OTHER BIRD AND TO PERFORM ALL FUNCTIONS THERE SAVE THOSE OF SLEEPING AND INCUBATION THIS HI RUNDO DIFFERS WIDELY FROM ITS CONGENERS IN LAYING INVA RIABLY BUT TWO EGGS AT A TIME WHICH ARE MILKWHITE LONG AND PEAKED AT THE SMALL END WHEREAS THE OTHER SPECIES LAY AT EACH BROOD FROM FOUR TO SIX IT IS A MOST ALERT BIRD RISING VERY EARLY AND RETIRING TO REST VERY LATE AND IS ON THE WING IN THE HEIGHT OF SUMMER AT LEAST SIXTEEN HOURS IN THE LONGEST DAYS IT DOES NOT WITHDRAW TO REST TILL A QUARTER BEFORE NINE IN THE EVENING BEING THE LATEST OF ALL DAYBIRDS JUST BEFORE THEY RETIRE WHOLE GROUPS OF THEM ASSEMBLE IN THE AIR AND SQUEAK AND SHOOT ABOUT WITH267 WITH WONDERFUL RAPIDITY BUT THIS BIRD IS NEVER SO MUCH ALIVE AS IN SULTRY THUNDRY WEATHER WHEN IT EXPRESSES GREAT ALACRITY AND CALLS FORTH ALL ITS POWERS IN HOT MORNINGS SEVERAL GETTING TOGETHER IN LITTLE PARTIES DASH ROUND THE STEEPLES AND CHURCHES SQUEAKING AS THEY GO IN A VERY CLAMOROUS MANNER THESE BY NICE OBSERVERS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MALES SERENADING THEIR SITTING HENS AND NOT WITHOUT REASON SINCE THEY NEVER SQUEAK TILL THEY COME CLOSE TO THE WALLS OR CAVES AND SINCE THOSE WITHIN UTTER AT THE SAME TIME A LITTLE INWARD NOTE OF COMPLA CENCY WHEN THE HEN HAS SAT HARD ALL DAY SHE RUSHES FORTH JUST AS IT IS ALMOST DARK WHEN SHE STRETCHES AND RE LIEVES HER WEARY LIMBS AND SNATCHES A SCANTY MEAL FOR A FEW MINUTES AND THEN RETURNS TO HER DUTY OF INCUBATION SWIFTS WHEN WANTONLY AND CRUELLY SHOT WHILE THEY HAVE YOUNG DISCOVER A LITTLE LUMP OF INSECTS IN THEIR MOUTHS WHICH THEY POUCH AND HOLD UNDER THEIR TONGUE IN GE NERAL THEY FEED IN A MUCH HIGHER DISTRICT THAN THE OTHER SPECIES A PROOF THAT GNATS AND OTHER INSECTS DO ALSO ABOUND TO A CONSIDERABLE HEIGHT IN THE AIR THEY ALSO RANGE TO GREAT DISTANCE SINCE LOCOMOTION IS NO LABOUR TO THEM WHO ARE ENDOWED WITH SUCH VAST POWERS OF WING THEIR POWERS SEEM TO BE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR LEVERS AND THEIR WINGS ARE LONGER IN PROPORTION THAN THOSE OF ALMOST ANY OTHER BIRD WHEN THEY MUTE OR EASE THEM SELVES IN FLIGHT THEY RAISE THEIR WINGS AND MAKE THEM MEET OVER THEIR HEADS AT SOME CERTAIN TIMES IN THE SUMMER I HAD REMARKED THAT SWIFTS WERE HAWKING LOW FOR HOURS TOGETHER OVER POOLS AND STREAMS AND COULD NOT268 NOT HELP ENQUIRING INTO THE OBJECT OF THEIR PURSUIT THAT INDUCED THEM TO DESCEND SO MUCH BELOW THEIR USUAL RANGE AFTER SOME TROUBLE I FOUND THAT THEY WERE TAKING PHRYGANEAE EPHEMERAE AND LIBELLULAE CADEWFLIES MAY FLIES AND DRAGONFLIES THAT WERE JUST EMERGED OUT OF THEIR AURELIASTATE I THEN NO LONGER WONDERED THAT THEY SHOULD BE SO WILLING TO STOOP FOR A PREY THAT YIELDED THEM SUCH PLENTIFUL AND SUCCULENT NOURISHMENT THEY BRING OUT THEIR YOUNG ABOUT THE MIDDLE OR LATTER END OF JULY BUT AS THESE NEVER BECOME PERCHERS NOR THAT EVER I COULD DISCERN ARE FED ON THE WING BY THEIR DAMS THE COMING FORTH OF THE YOUNG IS NOT SO NOTORIOUS AS IN THE OTHER SPECIES ON THE 30TH OF JUNE LAST I UNTILED THE EAVES OF A HOUSE WHERE MANY PAIRS BUILD AND FOUND IN EACH NEST ONLY TWO NAKED SQUAB PULLI ON THE EIGHTH OF JULY I REPEATED THE SAME ENQUIRY AND FOUND THEY HAD MADE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS TOWARDS A FLEDGED STATE BUT WERE STILL NAKED AND HELPLESS FROM WHENCE WE MAY CONCLUDE THAT BIRDS WHOSE WAY OF LIFE KEEPS THEM PERPETUALLY ON THE WING WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO QUIT THEIR NEST TILL THE END OF THE MONTH SWALLOWS AND MARTINS THAT HAVE NUME ROUS FAMILIES ARE CONTINUALLY FEEDING THEM EVERY TWO OR THREE MINUTES WHILE SWIFTS THAT HAVE BUT TWO YOUNG TO MAINTAIN ARE MUCH AT THEIR LEISURE AND DO NOT ATTEND ON THEIR NESTS FOR HOURS TOGETHER SOMETIMES THEY PURSUE AND STRIKE AT HAWKS THAT COME IN THEIR WAY BUT NOT WITH THAT VEHEMENCE AND FURY THAT SWALLOWS EXPRESS ON THE SAME OCCASION THEY ARE OUT ALL DAY LONG IN WET DAYS FEEDING ABOUT AND DISREGARDING STILL RAIN FROM WHENCE269 WHENCE TWO THINGS MAY BE GATHERED FIRST THAT MANY IN SECTS ABIDE HIGH IN THE AIR EVEN IN RAIN AND NEXT THAT THE FEATHERS OF THESE BIRDS MUST BE WELL PREENED TO RESIST SO MUCH WET WINDY AND PARTICULARLY WINDY WEATHER WITH HEAVY SHOWERS THEY DISLIKE AND ON SUCH DAYS WITH DRAW AND SCARCE EVER ARE SEEN THERE IS A CIRCUM STANCE RESPECTING THE COLOUR OF SWIFTS WHICH SEEMS NOT TO BE UNWORTHY OUR ATTENTION WHEN THEY APPEAR IN THE SPRING THEY ARE ALL OVER OF A GLOSSY DARK SOOTCOLOUR EX CEPT THEIR CHINS WHICH ARE WHITE BUT BY BEING ALL DAY LONG IN THE SUN AND AIR THEY BECOME QUITE WEATHER BEATEN AND BLEACHED BEFORE THEY DEPART AND YET THEY RETURN GLOSSY AGAIN IN THE SPRING NOW IF THEY PURSUE THE SUN INTO LOWER LATITUDES AS SOME SUPPOSE IN ORDER TO ENJOY A PERPETUAL SUMMER WHY DO THEY NOT RETURN BLEACHED DO THEY NOT RATHER PERHAPS RETIRE TO REST FOR A SEASON AND AT THAT JUNCTURE MOULT AND CHANGE THEIR FEATHERS SINCE ALL OTHER BIRDS ARE KNOWN TO MOULT SOON AFTER THE SEASON OF BREEDING SWIFTS ARE VERY ANOMA LOUS IN MANY PARTICULARS DISSENTING FROM ALL THEIR CON GENERS NOT ONLY IN THE NUMBER OF THEIR YOUNG BUT IN BREEDING BUT ONCE IN A SUMMER WHEREAS ALL THE OTHER BRITISH HIRUNDINES BREED INVARIABLY TWICE IT IS PAST ALL DOUBT THAT SWIFTS CAN BREED BUT ONCE SINCE THEY WITH DRAW IN A VERY SHORT TIME AFTER THE FLIGHT OF THEIR YOUNG AND SOME TIME BEFORE THEIR CONGENERS BRING OUT THEIR SE COND BROODS WE MAY HERE REMARK THAT AS SWIFTS BREED BUT ONCE IN A SUMMER AND ONLY TWO AT A TIME AND THE OTHER HIRUNDINES TWICE THE LATTER WHO LAY FROM FOUR TO SIX270 SIX EGGS INCREASE AT AN AVERAGE FIVE TIMES AS FAST AS THE FOR MER BUT IN NOTHING ARE SWIFTS MORE SINGULAR THAN IN THEIR EARLY RETREAT THEY RETIRE AS TO THE MAIN BODY OF THEM BY THE 10TH OF AUGUST AND SOMETIMES A FEW DAYS SOONER AND EVERY STRAGGLER INVARIABLY WITHDRAWS BY THE 20TH WHILE THEIR CONGENERS ALL OF THEM STAY TILL THE BEGIN NING OF OCTOBER MANY OF THEM STAY ALL THROUGH THE MONTH AND SOME OCCASIONALLY TO THE BEGINNING OF NO VEMBER THIS EARLY RETREAT IS MYSTERIOUS AND WONDERSUL SINCE THAT TIME IS OFTEN THE SWEETEST SEASON IN THE YEAR BUT WHAT IS MORE WONDERFUL THEY RETIRE STILL EARLIER IN THE MOST SOUTHERLY PARTS OF ANDALUSIA WHERE THEY CAN BE NO WAYS INFLUENCED BY ANY DEFECT OF HEAT OR AS ONE MIGHT SUPPOSE BY ANY DEFECT OF FOOD ARE THEY REGU LATED IN THEIR MOTIONS WITH US BY A FAILURE OF FOOD OR BY A PROPENSITY TO MOULTING OR BY A DISPOSITION TO REST AFTER SO RAPID A LIFE OR BY WHAT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE INCI DENTS IN NATURAL HISTORY THAT NOT ONLY BAFFLES OUR SEARCHES BUT ALMOST ELUDES OUR GUESSES THESE HIRUNDINES NE VER PERCH ON TREES OR ROOFS AND SO NEVER CONGREGATE WITH THEIR CONGENERS THEY ARE FEARLESS WHILE HAUNTING THEIR NESTING PLACES ARE NOT TO BE SCARED WITH A GUN AND ARE OFTEN BEATEN DOWN WITH POLES AS THEY STOOP TO GO UNDER THE EAVES THEY ARE ALSO MUCH INFESTED WITH THOSE PESTS TO THE WHOLE GENUS CALLED HIPPOBOSCAE HIRUNDINIS AND OFTEN WRIGGLE AND SCRATCH THEMSELVES IN THEIR FLIGHT TO GET RID OF THESE CLINGING ANNOYANCES SWIFTS ARE NO SONGSTERS AND HAVE ONLY ONE HARSH SCREAMING NOTE YET THERE ARE EARS TO WHICH THAT NOTE IS NOT DISPLEASING FROM 4 AN271 AN AGREEABLE ASSOCIATION OF IDEAS SINCE THAT NOTE NEVER OCCURS BUT IN THE MOST LOVELY SUMMER WEATHER THEY NEVER SETTLE ON THE GROUND BUT THROUGH ACCIDENT AND WHEN DOWN CAN HARDLY RISE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SHORTNESS OF THEIR LEGS AND THE LENGTH OF THEIR WINGS NEITHER CAN THEY WALK BUT ONLY CRAWL BUT THEY HAVE A STRONG GRASP WITH THEIR FEETBY WHICH THEY CLING TO WALLS THEIR BODIES BEING FLAT THEY CAN ENTER INTO A VERY NARROW CREVICE AND WHERE THEY CANNOT PASS ON THEIR BELLIES THEY WILL TURN UP EDGE WAYS THE PARTICULAR FORMATION OF THE SWIFTS FOOT DIS CRIMINATES THAT BIRD FROM ALL THE BRITISH HIRUNDINES AND INDEED FROM ALL OTHER KNOWN BIRDS THE HIRUNDO MELBA OR GREAT WHITEBELLIED SWIFT OF GIBRALTAR EXCEPTED FOR IT IS SO DISPOSED AS TO CARRY OMNES QUATUOR DIGITOS ANTICOS BE SIDES THE LEAST TOE WHICH SHOULD BE THE BACK TOE CON SISTS ONLY OF ONE BONE ALONE AND THE OTHER THREE ONLY OF TWO APIECE A CONSTRUCTION MOST RARE AND PECULIAR BUT NICELY ADAPTED TO THE PURPOSES IN WHICH THEIR FEET ARE EMPLOYED THIS AND SOME PECULIARITIES ATTENDING THE NOSTRILS AND UNDER MANDIBLE HAVE INDUCED A DISCERNING NATURALISTA TO SUPPOSE THAT THIS SPECIES MIGHT CONSTITUTE A GENUS PER SE IN LONDON A PARTY OF SWIFTS FREQUENT THE TOWER PLAYING AND FEEDING OVER THE RIVER JUST BE LOW THE BRIDGE OTHERS HAUNT SOME OF THE CHURCHES OF THE BOROUGH NEXT THE FIELDS BUT DO NOT VENTURE LIKE THE HOUSEMARTIN INTO THE CLOSE CROWDED PARTS OF THE TOWN THE SWEDES HAVE BESTOWED A VERY PERTINENT A JOHN ANTONY SCOPOLI OF CARNIOLA M D V O L LXV P P NAME272 NAME ON THIS SWALLOW CALLING IT RING SWALA FROM THE PER PETUAL RINGS OR CIRCLES THAT IT TAKES ROUND THE SCENE OF ITS NIDIFICATION I AM C L E T T E R III OF THE SANDMARTIN OR BANKMARTIN DEAR SIR SELBORNE FEB 26 1774 THE SANDMARTIN OR BANKMARTIN IS BY MUCH THE LEAST OF ANY OF THE BRITISH BIRUNDINES AND AS FAR AS EVER WE HAVE SEEN THE SMALLEST KNOWN HIRUNDO THOUGH BRISSON ASSERTS THAT THERE IS ONE MUCH SMALLER AND THAT IS THE HIRUNDO ESCULENTA BUT IT IS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED THAT IT IS SCARCE POSSIBLE FOR ANY OBSERVER TO BE SO FULL AND EXACT AS HE COULD WISH IN RECITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING THE LIFE AND CONVERSATION OF THIS LITTLE BIRD SINCE IT IS FERA NATURA AT LEAST IN THIS PART OF THE KING DOM DISCLAIMING ALL DOMESTIC ATTACHMENTS AND HAUNT ING WILD HEATHS AND COMMONS WHERE THERE ARE LARGE LAKES WHILE THE OTHER SPECIES ESPECIALLY THE SWALLOW AND HOUSEMARTIN ARE REMARKABLY GENTLE AND DOMESTICATED AND NEVER SEEM TO THINK THEMSELVES SAFE BUT UNDER THE PROTECTION OF MAN HERE ARE IN THIS PARISH IN THE SANDPITS AND BANKS OF THE LAKES OF WOOLMER FOREST SEVERAL COLONIES OF THESE BIRDS AND YET THEY ARE NEVER SEEN IN THE VILLAGE NOR DO THEY AT ALL FREQUENT THE COT TAGES273 TAGES THAT ARE SCATTERED ABOUT IN THAT WILD DISTRICT THE ONLY INSTANCE I EVER REMEMBER WHERE THIS SPECIES HAUNTS ANY BUILDING IS AT THE TOWN OF BISHOPS WALTHAM IN THIS COUNTY WHERE MANY SANDMARTINS NESTLE AND BREED IN THE SCAFFOLDHOLES OF THE BACKWALL OF WILLIAM OF WICK HAMS STABLES BUT THEN THIS WALL STANDS IN A VERY SE QUESTERED AND RETIRED ENCLOSURE AND FACES UPON A LARGE AND BEAUTIFUL LAKE AND INDEED THIS SPECIES SEEMS SO TO DELIGHT IN LARGE WATERS THAT NO INSTANCE OCCURS OF THEIR ABOUNDING BUT NEAR VAST POOLS OR RIVERS AND IN PARTICU LAR IT HAS BEEN REMARKED THAT THEY SWARM ON THE BANKS OF THE THAMES IN SOME PLACES BELOW BRIDGE IT IS CURIOUS TO OBSERVE WITH WHAT DIFFERENT DEGREES OF ARCHI TECTONIC SKILL PROVIDENCE HAS ENDOWED BIRDS OF THE SAME GENUS AND SO NEARLY CORRESPONDENT IN THEIR GENERAL MODE OF LIFE FOR WHILE THE SWALLOW AND THE HOUSEMARTIN DISCOVER THE GREATEST ADDRESS IN RAISING AND SECURELY FIX ING CRUSTS OR SHELLS OF LOAM AS CUNABULA FOR THEIR YOUNG THE BANKMARTIN TEREBRATES A ROUND AND REGULAR HOLE IN THE SAND OR EARTH WHICH IS SERPENTINE HORIZONTAL AND ABOUT TWO FEET DEEP AT THE INNER END OF THIS BURROW DOES THIS BIRD DEPOSIT IN A GOOD DEGREE OF SAFETY HER RUDE NEST CONSISTING OF FINE GRASSES AND FEATHERS USUALLY GOOSE FEATHERS VERY INARTIFICALLY LAID TOGETHER PERSEVERANCE WILL ACCOMPLISH ANY THING THOUGH ONE WOULD AT FIRST BE DISINCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THIS WEAK BIRD WITH HER SOFT AND TENDER BILL AND CLAWS SHOULD EVER BE ABLE TO BORE THE STUBBORN SANDBANK WITHOUT ENTIRELY DISABLING HERSELF YET WITH THESE FEEBLE INSTRUMENTS HAVE I SEEN A PAIR OF P P 2 THEM274 THEM MAKE GOOD DISPATCH AND COULD REMARK HOW MUCH THEY HAD SCOOPED THAT DAY BY THE FRESH SAND WHICH RAN DOWN THE BANK AND WAS OF A DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM THAT WHICH LAY LOOSE AND BLEACHED IN THE SUN IN WHAT SPACE OF TIME THESE LITTLE ARTISTS ARE ABLE TO MINE AND FINISH THESE CAVITIES I HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO DISCOVER FOR REA SONS GIVEN ABOVE BUT IT WOULD BE A MATTER WORTHY OF OBSERVATION WHERE IT FALLS IN THE WAY OF ANY NATURALIST TO MAKE HIS REMARKS THIS I HAVE OFTEN TAKEN NOTICE OF THAT SEVERAL HOLES OF DIFFERENT DEPTHS ARE LEFT UNFINISHED AT THE END OF SUMMER TO IMAGINE THAT THESE BEGIN NINGS WERE INTENTIONALLY MADE IN ORDER TO BE IN GREATER FORWARDNESS FOR NEXT SPRING IS ALLOWING PERHAPS TOO MUCH FORESIGHT AND RERUM PRUDENTIA TO A SIMPLE BIRD MAY NOT THE CAUSE OF THESE LATEBRAE BEING LEFT UNFINISHED ARISE FROM THEIR MEETING IN THOSE PLACES WITH STRATA TOO HARD HARSH AND SOLID FOR THEIR PURPOSE WHICH THEY RE LINQUISH AND GO TO A FRESH SPOT THAT WORKS MORE FREELY OR MAY THEY NOT IN OTHER PLACES FALL IN WITH A SOIL AS MUCH TOO LOOSE AND MOULDERING LIABLE TO FLOUNDER AND THREATENING TO OVERWHELM THEM AND THEIR LABOURS ONE THING IS REMARKABLE THAT AFTER SOME YEARS THE OLD HOLES ARE FORSAKEN AND NEW ONES BORED PERHAPS BECAUSE THE OLD HABITATIONS GROW FOUL AND FETID FROM LONG USE OR BECAUSE THEY MAY SO ABOUND WITH FLEAS AS TO BECOME UNTENANTABLE THIS SPECIES OF SWALLOW MOREOVER IS STRANGELY ANNOYED WITH FLEAS AND WE HAVE SEEN FLEAS BEDFLEAS PULEX IRRITANS SWARMING AT THE MOUTHS OF THESE HOLES LIKE BEES ON THE STOOLS OF THEIR HIVES WHEN THEY275 THEY HAPPEN TO BREED NEAR HEDGES AND ENCLOSURES THEY ARE DISPOSSESSED OF THEIR BREEDING HOLES BY THE HOUSE SPARROW WHICH IS ON THE SAME ACCOUNT A FELL ADVERSARY TO HOUSEMARTINS THE FOLLOWING CIRCUMSTANCE SHOULD BY NO MEANS BE OMITTED THAT THESE BIRDS DO NOT MAKE USE OF THESE CAVERNS BY WAY OF HYBERNACULA AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED SINCE BANKS SO PERFORATED HAVE BEEN DUG OUT WITH CARE IN THE WINTER WHEN NOTHING WAS FOUND BUT EMPTY NESTS THE SANDMARTIN ARRIVES MUCH ABOUT THE SAME TIME WITH THE SWALLOW AND LAYS AS SHE DOES FROM FOUR TO SIX WHITE EGGS BUT AS THIS SPECIES IS CRYP TOGAME CARRYING ON THE BUSINESS OF NIDIFICATION INCUBA TION AND THE SUPPORT OF ITS YOUNG IN THE DARK IT WOULD NOT BE SO EASY TO ASCERTAIN THE TIME OF BREEDING WERE IT NOT FOR THE COMING FORTH OF THE BROODS WHICH APPEAR MUCH ABOUT THE TIME OR RATHER SOMEWHAT EARLIER THAN THOSE OF THE SWALLOW THE NESTLINGS ARE SUPPORTED IN COMMON LIKE THOSE OF THE CONGENERS WITH GNATS AND OTHER SMALL INSECTS AND SOMETIMES THEY ARE FED WITH LI BELLULAE DRAGONFLIES ALMOST AS LONG AS THEMSELVES THE LAST WEEK IN JUNE WE HAVE SEEN A ROW OF THESE SITTING ON A RAIL NEAR A GREAT POOL AS PERCHERS AND SO YOUNG AND HELPLESS AS EASILY TO BE TAKEN BY HAND BUT WHETHER THE DAMS EVER FEED THEM ON THE WING AS SWALLOWS AND HOUSE MARTINS DO WE HAVE NEVER YET BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE NOR DO WE KNOW WHETHER THEY PURSUE AND ATTACK BIRDS OF PREY THESE HIRUNDINES ARE NO SONGSTERS BUT RATHER MUTE MAKING ONLY A LITTLE HARSH NOISE WHEN A PERSON AP PROACHES THEIR NESTS THEY SEEM NOT TO BE OF A SOCIABLE TURN276 TURN NEVER WITH US CONGREGATING WITH THEIR CONGENERS IN THE AUTUMN UNDOUBTEDLY THEY BREED A SECOND TIME LIKE THE HOUSEMARTIN AND SWALLOW AND WITHDRAW ABOUT MICHAELMAS THOUGH IN SOME PARTICULAR DISTRICTS THEY MAY HAPPEN TO ABOUND YET IN THE WHOLE IN THE SOUTH OF ENGLAND AT LEAST IS THIS MUCH THE RAREST SPECIES FOR THERE ARE FEW TOWNS OR LARGE VILLAGES BUT WHAT ABOUND WITH HOUSEMARTINS FEW CHURCHES TOWERS OR STEEPLES BUT WHAT ARE HAUNTED BY SOME SWIFTS SCARCE A HAMLET OR SINGLE COTTAGECHIMNEY THAT HAS NOT ITS SWALLOW WHILE THE BANKMARTINS SCATTERED HERE AND THERE LIVE A SEQUES TERED LIFE AMONG SOME ABRUPT SANDHILLS AND IN THE BANKS OF SOME FEW RIVERS THESE BIRDS HAVE A PECU LIAR MANNER OF FLYING FLITTING ABOUT WITH ODD JERKS AND VACILLATIONS NOT UNLIKE THE MOTIONS OF A BUTTERFLY DOUBTLESS THE FLIGHT OF ALL HIRUNDINES IS INFLUENCED BY AND ADAPTED TO THE PECULIAR SORT OF INSECTS WHICH FURNISH THEIR FOOD HENCE IT WOULD BE WORTH ENQUIRY TO EXA MINE WHAT PARTICULAR GENUS OF INSECTS AFFORDS THE PRIN CIPAL FOOD OF EACH RESPECTIVE SPECIES OF SWALLOW SAND MARTINS DIFFER FROM THEIR CONGENERS IN THE DIMINUTIVE NESS OF THEIR SIZE AND IN THEIR COLOUR WHICH IS WHAT IS USUALLY CALLED A MOUSECOLOUR NEAR VALENTIA IN SPAIN THEY ARE TAKEN AND SOLD IN THE MARKETS FOR THE TABLE AND ARE CALLED BY THE COUNTRY PEOPLE PROBABLY FROM THEIR DESULTORY JERKING MANNER OF FLIGHT

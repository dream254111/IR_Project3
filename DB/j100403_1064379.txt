owner of land upon another to do an act or series of acts upon the formers land the licensee possessing no estate or interest in the land itself or else an authority conferred upon the owner of servient land by one entitled to an easement therein to do an act or series of acts upon the servient land in obstruction of the easement 1 A license being a mere authority sufferance or per mission a matter of personal trust confidence or favor and differ ing from an easement in that it creates no estate or interest in the land it may be generally stated that licenses are revocable at the pleasure of the licensor2 Licenses coupled with an interest form a notable exception to this general rule3 In their nature they are closely akin to easements and in general are governed by the same rules applicable to them A distinction is also recognized between a license to do an act on the land of the licensor and a license to do an act on the licensees own land in obstruction of an easement therein In the latter case 1 MINOR REAL PROPERTY  132 2 Sterling z Warden 51 N H 217 12 Am Rep 80 Huff v McCauley 53 Pa St 206 91 Am Dec 203 3 Jenkins v Lykes 19 Fla 148 45 Am Rep 19 United Society of Shakers z Brooks 145 Mass 410 14 N E 622VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW it is agreed that if the act be of a permanent nature and is actually performed the license is irrevocable4 In dealing with the question of the revocation of parol licenses the courts have adopted without hesitation the general rule just stated where the license has as yet not been acted upon or where there has been no consideration paid for the privilege claimed or no expense incurred by the licensee in connection therewith Where however the licensee acting upon the license places a burden upon the land of another and incurs expense in placing or maintaining the encumbrance thereon or has paid valuable consideration for the exercise of the privilege the courts are at variance This lack of harmony in the decisions is often due to the reluctance of the court to apply a doctrine whose application frequently works a manifest injustice in the individual case Another fruitful source of discord is the courts failure to preserve the distinction between an ease ment and a license Perhaps the greatest confusion is caused by a misconception of the equitable doctrines of specific performance and estoppel or the application of these doctrines to a state of facts not legitimately within their scope The first cause of lack of uniformity among the decisions calls for no discussion The ground of hardship alone should never be considered sufficient to except a particular case from the application of a general rule of law The distinction upon a given state of facts between an easement and a license is in many cases subtle and it is often difficult to dis cern a substantial difference But the distinction once made the result should easily follow Easements lie in grant and to create an easement otherwise than by prescription which supposes a grant or the socalled easement by natural right an instrument under seal and containing proper words of grant is necessary5 for an easement is a permanent interest in anothers land with the right at all times to enter and enjoy it A license on the other hand is founded upon personal confidence is not within the statute of frauds and the licensee has no interest in the land Strictly speak ing then no right to place a burden upon the land which is not rev ocable at will can be granted by a license because the moment it ceases to be so revocable it creates an interest in the land and rises to the dignity of an estate or easement7 Since a mere licensee under a parol license cannot claim an easement that requiring a deed nor the benefit of a contract for an easement that requiring writing 4 Stein v Dahm 96 Ala 481 11 So 597 Morse v Copeland 2 Gray Mass 302 B Nunnelly v Southern Iron Co 94 Tenn 397 29 S W 361 28 L R A 421 Wynn v Garland 19 Ark 23 68 Am

where there is not merely a license but a contract to create an easement although not in writing there may still be such part performance of the contract as in equity to take it out of the statute of frauds and under such circumstances in a proper case a court of equity will decree specific performance of the contract10 Many cases which merely state that a license after the licensee has in curred expenses is irrevocable properly fall within this principle and are correctly decided1 Others illogically hold that the licensee by incurring expense on the faith of the license thereby transforms the license into an easement running with the land12 Still others erroneously consider an executed license a parol agreement or con tract and grant relief on that ground13 It is submitted however that where a mere license is given there is no express agreement to grant an easement and it is by no means certain that the parties so intended To imply such an agreement and then enforce it on the ground of specific performance is hardly justifiable upon any sound reason It is not the province of courts to make contracts for the parties and as a mere license implies no contract there is nothing upon which to base the doctrine of specific performance Many cases however ignoring this principle yet hold fhat a license is irrevocable although there is in fact no contract nor even a con sideration a material element of all contracts upon which to in voke the doctrine of specific performance14 Clearly such cases are wrong and the licensor should be allowed to revoke The granting of specific performance of such contracts by a court of equity in volves no principles different from those applicable to other con tracts within the statute of frauds In order to justify specific per formance of an agreement for an easement in land such agreement must be a complete and sufficient contract founded not only upon a valuable consideration but its terms defined by satisfactory proof accompanied by acts of part performance unequivocably referable 8 Dorris v Sullivan 90 Cal 279 27 Pac 216 In the recent case of Jann v Standard Cement Co Ind 102 N E 872 the court seems to have gone unnecessarily into the subject of licenses as the decision might more properly have been based upon the law applicable to easements 10 Miller v Brown 33 Ohio St 547 Wynn v Garland supra If an oral permission for the use of land as a way would if under seal have created an easement equity may regard it as an equitable ease ment and irrevocable upon part performance by the licensee by expen diture of money or

REVIEW to the supposed agreement and the remedy at law must be wholly inadequate15 Estoppel with reference to parol licenses has been applied by many courts seemingly upon a misconception of this equitable doc trine The doctrine of estoppel involves an element of fraud or deception on the part of one who by his false holding out has in duced another to act thereon to his damage Where a licensor by direct encouragement to expend money by assurance of title induces the licensee to act to his detriment it seems the doctrine of estoppel is properly applicable But such cases are rare and present no dif ficulty In the usual case this element of deception or holding out by the licensor is lacking yet not a few courts hold in these cases that where the licensee has gone to expense as a result of the license and cannot be placed in statu quo the licensor is estopped to revoke the license which becomes irrevocable16 Clearly the doctrine of estoppel should not apply in such a case Ordinarily to work an estoppel in pais there must be a misrepresentation of fact or an encouragement of one known to be acting upon a mistake of fact or a holding out of false hopes to him by a definite promise None of these elements are present in case of a mere license The ma jority of the courts and upon the better reason have refused to ap ply the doctrine of estoppel to such a case which seems in some jurisdictions to have been resorted to in order to escape the statute of frauds17 The conclusion to be reached and which seems supported by the weight of authority is that a mere license is revocable at the pleasure of the licensor notwithstanding the fact that the licensee has in curred expense on the faith of the license or has given valuable consideration for the privilege and although the circumstances of the case are such that the licensee cannot be placed in statu quo18 It might be said in answer to those cases holding merely because 15 Johnson v Skillman 29 Minn 95

expenditure of money upon the faith of the license that the licensor will because of the hardship of the case not be allowed to revoke that a court of equity is not without power to grant relief where it is necessary for the licensor to come into court to establish the revocation On the ground that he who comes into equity must do equity the licensor in such a case may be compelled to allow the licensee to remove fixtures placed upon the land or that being impracticable he may be required to make just compensation therefor19 CONTRIBUTION AS BETWEEN JOINT TORTFEASORSThe rule is general and well established that one who has been forced to an swer in damages for the full consequences of a wrong for which others were equally liable cannot exact contribution from his co delinquents This rule rests in the main upon two grounds In the iirst place one will not be permitted to found his cause of action upon his own misconduct Contribution rests upon an equitable basis and no equities can have their source in a breach of the law He who contemns the law has placed himself so far beyond its pale that its machinery will not be set in motion to give him even partial relief from the consequences of his culpability In the second place the denial of contribution in such cases is believed to subserve the policy of the law in that it intimidates and deters potential tort feasors by making each liable for the entire joint wrong and leaving the incidence of the burden to the election of the aggrieved party But though the rule that there can be no contribution among joint wrongdoers has become well settled and inveterate there are many exceptions to it These exceptions are of such frequent occurrence that one writer has been led to make the statement that they have displaced the cocalled general rule and that the latter is but an exception to the rule constituted by them A review of the cases bearing upon this subject indicates that the doctrine that joint tort feasors cannot enforce contribution is departed from to a greater or less extent in the following instances 1 Where one is an active participant in the commission of a tort but is innocent of any evil intent The overwhelming weight of authority is to the effect that where there is no intentional nor deliberate violation of the law and where the act is of such a nature that consciousness of wrongdoing is not necessarily presumed then contribution will not be denied2 Under this head would be placed those cases of torts or injuries arising from mistakes accidents or involuntary ommissions

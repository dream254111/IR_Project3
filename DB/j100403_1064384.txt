j100403,Virginia Law Review,1064384, The Construction of the Term Insolvent as Used in  3a4 of the Bankruptcy Act ,i243762,VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW a decision on this purely preliminary question is held to be an ex ercise of the judicial discretion It is said that to entertain the writ of mandamus would amount to a complete review of the case below and an abuse of the discretion of the intermediate court but this can hardly be true since the question before the highest court involves merely the sufficiency or insufficiency under the constitution and stat utes of the appeal as taken A further reason for refusing to issue mandamus is found according to these cases in the desire on the part of the highest court to keep from being overwhelmed by ap plications for the writ THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE TERM INSOLVENT AS USED IN  3a4 OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACTA general assignment for the benefit of creditors constitutes in itself an act of bankruptcy1 The sol vency or insolvency of the assignor at the time the assignment was executed or at the time the petition was filed is immaterial2 Prior to the amendment of 1903 this was the only act of bankruptcy set out by  3a4 It was also held that the fact that a receiver or trustee had been put in charge of a debtors property did not con stitute an assignment for the benefit of creditors and therefore was not an act of bankruptcy3 In view of these decisions the practice grew up of having receivers or trustees appointed for insolvent estates instead of making general assignments and thus evading the provision of  3a4 of the act But in 1903 an amendment was added to this section to provide for just such cases and to give the creditors an opportunity to have the insolvent estate of the debtor administered under the bankruptcy act This amendment provided that a person shall be guilty of an act of bankruptcy if being insolvent applied for a receiver or trustee for his property or because of insolvency a receiver or trustee has been put in charge of his property under the laws of a state of a territory or of the United States It is evident from the language of the statute that the fact that a receiver or trustee has been applied for or put in charge of the debtors property is not in itself an act of bankruptcy Whether or not he was insolvent at the time of his application for a receiver whether or not a receiver was put in charge because of insolvency are the essential considerations4 And whether the debtors insol by Baskin J Treadway v Wright 4 Nev 119 Andrews v Cook 28 Nev 265 81 Pac 303 This latter case expressly

act is the subject of much conflict In the first instance where the debtor himself applies for a re ceiver or trustee the essential element of the act is being insolvent at the time The act defines when a person is deemed to be insol vent6 Therefore the debtor must be insolvent according to this definition and it is not sufficient to prove that he is insolvent ac cording to the usual acceptation of the term namely unable to pay his debts as they mature in the usual course of business6 Further more this fact is to be determined by the bankruptcy court7 It is to be observed however that when the act of bankruptcy complained of is the latter part of  3a4 because of insolvency a receiver or trustee has been put in charge of his property under the laws of a state of a territory or of the United States the essential feature is that the receiver or trustee was put in charge because of insolvency and not the fact that the debtor is insol vent8 The burden of litigation in these cases is over the definition of insolvency whether the state rule as to insolvency or the definition in the bankruptcy act is to be applied The recent case of In re Wm S Butler  Co 207 Fed 705 held that the definition of the term insolvency as given in  la15 of the bankruptcy act is the one to be applied in determining the mean ing of the term as used in  3a4 It would seem however to be the better view on both reason and authority that by insolvency as used in  3a4 is meant insolvency as understood and applied by the courts appointing the receiver or trustee under the laws of a state of a territory or of the United States and not necessarily as defined in the bankruptcy act9 For when we look at the reason for the adding of this amendment and that it relates to proceedings in courts of equity and common law it may be assumed that in de scribing those proceedings it used the language of those courts and in the light of the construction placed upon it by those courts And no court of equity or common law has ever in appointing receivers or trustees used the term insolvency in the special sense as defined by the bankruptcy act10 Thus to give the term insolvency as used Bankr Act  la15 provides that a person shall be deemed in solvent within the provisions of this act whenever the aggregate of his property exclusive of any property which he may have conveyed trans ferred concealed or removed or permitted to be concealed or removed with intent to defraud hinder or delay his creditors shall not at a fair valuation be sufficient in amount to pay his debts 6 Exploration Mercantile

in  3a4 such a meaning would be to defeat practically the very purpose of the amendment A state court may appoint a receiver or trustee to take charge of a debtors property on many grounds one of which may be his in solvency In such cases the court is governed by the laws of the state in determining the question of insolvency which may not be and in fact generally is not the same rule as that defined in the bankruptcy act But the act itself provides that if the meaning of any term as defined by it shall be inconsistent with the context such definition shall give way and the term construed in consistency with the meaning of the context Therefore in view of this provision it would seem that Congress by adding the words under the laws of a state or a territory or the United States to this clause in tended that those laws and not the bankruptcy act should govern in determining the question of insolvency12 The fact that it is now settled that the phrase law of a state as used in  3a4 is not limited to the statute law but also includes the appointment of receivers or trustees where the court is acting under its general equity power would also seem to give weight to this view13 The appointment of a receiver or trustee because of insol vency is the essential factor of this act of bankruptcy but whether the receiver or trustee was put in charge of the debtors property because of insolvency depends upon the state of facts disclosed upon the record in the case before the court appointing the re ceiver or trustee14 And if the order of the court recites the grounds of appointment the recital cannot be contradicted without impeach ing the record and this is not permissible15 But if the record does not show that the debtor was insolvent the bankruptcy court is pre cluded from considering evidence aliunde to show his insolvencyl Therefore it follows that the finding of the state court as to in solvency is conclusive and as they apply their rule as to insolvency in the appointment of receivers it would seem that this is the con struction to be given to the term insolvency as used in  3a 4 and not the one as defined in the bankruptcy act n Bankr Act  la 12 LOVELAND

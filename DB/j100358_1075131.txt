the laboratory equipment etc Each chapter is preceded by a few selected references and on pp 22936 is a classified list of texts reference books laboratory manuals and periodicals for the use of

pp 9798 Chiefly a list of translations into the Polish of American articles and works on childstudy The Child His Thinking Feeling and Doing By AMY E TANNER Chicago 1904 Pp 430 12mo The numerous references both to books and periodical articles at the close of every chapter form one of the best classified bibliographies extant of the really important and essential literature of childstudy There are eighteen chapters with concrete captions thus securing a sufficiently minute working classification The very few occasional words of annotation only make us wish that the author had attempted more in this direction Bibliography of ChildStudy for the Year 1903 By L N WILSON In Pedagogical Seminary July 1904 Vol XI pp 83118 Records 486 titles in alphabetical order followed by the usual subject index This the seventh similar annual summary appears also in separate form as No 4 Vol I of Publications of the Clark University Library 648RECENT EDUCATIONAL BIBLIOGRAPHY 649

Report of the Commissioner of Education for 1900oo19o Vol II pp 131015 and noted in School Review Vol XI p 683 The seventeen new titles have been chosen to show the history of coeducation as set forth by those who have been personally familiar with its progress together with opinions as to its practical effects based upon scientific considerations or authoritative experience Brief but helpful notes follow many of the titles COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY Columbiana A Bibliography of Manuscripts Pamphlets and Books Relating to the History of Kings College Columbia College Columbia University By CHARLES ALEXANDER NELSON New York 1904 Pp 48 8vo A published record of the exhibition of Columbiana on the celebration of the 50oth anniversary in October 1904 A reduced facsimile of the original charter of Kings College forms this frontispiece The arrangement of material is alphabetic under alphabetic class headings such as Athletics Commencement etc As the bibliography is intended to cover only historical material official publications such as catalogues announcements etc are not included COMMERCIAL EDUCATION Meaning and Practice of Commercial Education By C A HERRICK New York 1904 Pp 378 12mo Appendix II pp 35070 contains the only important and extensive bibliography of this subject that has yet been printed It does not claim to be complete but nearly or quite all of the notable titles are included although unfortunately there is no designa tion of these titles among the great number of others relatively less important A few notes or even the indication by asterisks would have been a great aid to the uninformed student using the list or to the librarian seeking in it a guide to book selection DEFECTIVES Mental Defectives Their History Treatment and Training By M W BARR Philadelphia 1904 Pp 368 8vo A useful list of references is printed on pp 33847 EDUCATION Bibliography of Education for 1904 By J I WYER JR and ISABEL E LORD In Educational Review June 1905 Vol XXX pp 4193 This is the sixth annual number of this analytic annotated list of the English literature of education Four hundred and sixtysix items selected from the annual grist of educational writings as worth notice are classified by subjects and accompanied by a full author index The present compilers will be unable to continue this work as in the past and it would seem as if the National Educational Association or the Bureau of Education might profitably assume the continuation of a similar list The following titles are indicated by the compilers as representing the cream of the years650 THE SCHOOL REVIEW productbooks that should be found in every library and read by or accurately known to every serious student of education The books are grouped by subject i Boone Science of

University jormerly Columbian Bibliography Titles of Books Monographs Papers etc Published by Members of the Faculties Doctors of Philosophy and Doctors of Civil Law Washington 1904 PP 59 8vo A list like this recording in detail the publications chiefly on scientific subjects of sixtyfour members of the present faculty or of graduates on whom certain degrees have been conferred can hardly be said to form an important or scarcely even a legitimate contribution to the bibliography of a university While it certainly is men that make a university yet the only real bibliography of a university is a list of works about it not about a thousand and one topics by the men who chance at a given moment to form its faculty or to have received its degrees GERMAN LANGUAGE The Teaching of German in Secondary Schools By E W B COLLINS New York 1904 Pp 232 12mo On pp 22432 the author has listed the principal books pamphlets and articles found helpful in preparing the book and he refers the student

for the disregard of the veriest elementary principles of good cataloguing For instance in the section TextBooks are fortyone titles They are neither arranged alphabetically by authors surname which is the best way nor by title which is a little better than no arrangement at all but just thrown together haphazard so that one must begin at the beginning and look through the whole list to discover if a certain book is included Education through Nature Study Foundations and Method By J P MUNSON New York 1904 Pp 297 12mo A list of reference books for the teachers library is given but it is not notable for careful selection PESTALOZZI PestalozziBibliographie die Schriften und Briefe Pestalozzis nach der Zeitiolge Schriften und Aufsiitze iiber ihn nach Inhalt und Zeitiolge Von AUGUST ISRAEL 3 vols 8VO Berlin 19034 Monumenta Germaniae Paeda gogica Vols XXV XXIX XXXI RELIGIOUS EDUCATION Moral Education By E H GRIGGS New York 1904 Pp 352 8vo Would that every author who appends a Bibliography to his work produced as good a one as that on pp 297341 of the above work It is avowedly not allinclusive and for the very good reason that it would waste space and money to catalogue all the rubbish that has been printed on this subject It is far more than the too frequent hastily tossed together jumble of good bad and indifferent references which have come to an authors notice Besides rigorously excluding material of no value Mr Griggs has omitted books and articles which have been quite superseded by more recent work and most helpful of all he has fully and frankly annotated almost every title thus multiplying many times its practical usefulness to students His arrange ment is alphabetical by authors the best cataloguing practice is observed in the form of headings crossreferences are given when needed and arrangement of imprint items is uniform and sensible For further material on Religious Education consult the heading Sunday School Teaching below SCHOOL ARCHITECTURE The Lighting of SchoolRooms By S H ROWE New York 1904 PP 94 12mo A list of twentythree carefully chosen English and German titles on school archi tecture and hygiene Helpful description and comment accompany each

SundaySchool the Outcome of Organization By J W AXTELL Nashville 1904 Pp 121 12mo The bibliography is limited to the topic of grading is helpfully annotated and includes not only general references on the subject but lists of graded textbooks lessonhelps and courses of study Such careful treatment of specific points in Sundayschool work illustrates the recent awakening in rational religious education One Hundred Good Books for Sunday School Workers In LAWRENCE MARION How to Conduct a Sunday School New York 19041 Pp 25364 Classified under the following headings Organization and History Religious Education in General Methods Primary and Junior Intermediate and Advanced Home Department Blackboard Work   The Superintendent The Pastor   Pedagogy Psychology Teacher Training  Missions Every title is annotated The two notable volumes from the Religious Education Association are not noted in the lists The arrangement of titles under each subject should be alphabetic by authors names which should precede the titles After the Primary What A Manual of Methods for the Junior Department of the Bible School By A H MCKINNEY New York 1904 Pp 146 8vo An Outline of a BibleSchool Curriculum

AND TEACHING The Teaching of Zoilogy in the Secondary School By M A BIGELOW In LLOYD AND BIGELOW The Teaching of Biology in the Secondary School New York 19041 Pp 241491 The different chapters are accompanied by full bibliographical references on the methodology of the subject but probably the most useful list is that in chap io pp 41447 zo6logical books This is the best list anywhere in print for the secondary school teacher of zo6logy in fact many college libraries and laboratories will find it helpful Lists of dealers in materials museum specimens laboratory apparatus and supplies are given and under each subdivision of zo6logy are grouped the titles of carefully chosen books and periodicals accompanied by helpful notes and textual comment The bibliographical references are far better in the zoological than in the botanical part of this useful book

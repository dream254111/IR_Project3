j100168,Harvard Law Review,1323732,Liability of Foreign Real Estate to Collateral Inheritance Tax,i256915,LIABILITY OF FOREIGN REAL ESTATE TO COLLATERAL INHERITANCE TAX  The very general adoption of inheritance and succession taxes has led to a careful examination by the courts of the theory on which they are based An inheritance tax seems clearly to be not a tax on the property itself nor on the legatee but a tax on the privilege of succeeding to prop erty on the death of the owner The fact that the b5urden of the tax may ultimately fall on the property and that the property is sometimes subjected to a lien until the tax is paid has led some courts to construe the tax as one on the property as well as on the privilege 2 but this seems to confuse the nature of the tax with the method of its enforcement The right to take property by descent or devise is a privilege granted by the law lot a natural right and the sovereignty which grants it may impose conditions on it1 Theoretically it would seem that the state might revoke this privilege at any time and make itself the universal legatee of all decedents Since suc cession to property is by permission of the sovereign the permission can re late only to property over which the sovereign has control A state has absolute dominion over all property within its territorial bounds and may 1 Magoun v Illinois etc Bank 170 U S 283 2 Bittingers Estate I29 Pa St 338202 LARVARD LAW REVIEW fix rules for its transfer descent and devolution In the case of person alty each state allows the property within its jurisdiction to pass by the law of the state of the decedents domicile 4 two states therefore each grant a privilege and each it seems if it chose could exact a tax But in the case of realty title passes by the Zex rei sit and that state alone controls the privilege of succession5 Where however the testator has directed the sale of his foreign real estate it has been argued that an equitable con version is worked and that therefore the state of his domicile may impose a tax on the proceeds as personalty A recent case before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upholds this position consistently with previous de cisions in that jurisdiction In re Vanuxems Estate 6 i Atl Rep 876 It would seem that the question as to whether a conversion has taken place must be determined by the law of the state where the land is situated since that state alone has dominion over the property But if it is determined that there is a conversion succession will occur by the law of the decedents domicile as in the case of other personalty6 The latter state may then ex act a bounty for the privilege granted by it An analogous question arises in tlle case of the interest of a deceased partner in foreign real estate belong ing to the partnership under the English rule that in the absence of any agreement partnership realty is ipso facto in the view of equity converted into personalty7 In such event the tax has been held valid8 and may be supported on the above reasoning But if the conversion is not effected by the will itself but is to be effected only at some future time it seems that succession will take place by the lex rei sia and therefore the state of testators domicile having granted no privilege can exact no tax Where for example a testator devised foreign real estate to his wife for life and upon her death directed its sale and the investment of the proceeds the tax is not imposable by the state of the testators domicile9 The fact that the proceeds of the sale are subsequently brought within the taxing state gives it no additional power for the succession takes place at the moment of death and the character of the property at that time is controlling10 8 McCormick v Sullivant Io Wheat U S 192 4 See Matter of Estate of Swift 137 N Y 77 86 6 Matter of Estate of Swift supra 6 See Re Stokes 62 L T 176 But see Estate of Swift supra contra 7 St 53  54 Vict C 39  20 22 8 Forbes v Steven L R Io Eq I78 Re Stokes supra But see Custance v Bradshaw 4 Hare 315 9 Hales Estate i6i Pa St i8i 10 Draytons Appeal 6i Pa St I72

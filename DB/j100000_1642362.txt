a mere zoologic or scientific museum It should be a museum of arts and letters as well as a museum of natural history Tl4e ethnology and arch eology of the Indians of New York make up a subject peculiarly apparent for treat ment in a museum of this character There should be here a representation of all our colonial and revolutionary life There should be in this museum for the instruc tion and inspiration of our people a full representation of American history since the time when New York cast off its pro vincial character and became an integral portion of the American republic Finally there should be here all the representation possible of the great arts and great litera tures of the nations of the past and the na tions of the present so that enriched by the knowledge of what has been done else where in time and in space our own peo ple shall be better equipped to work in the fields of original productive scholarship All this lies in the future At present we have only to do with biology A museum of this character has more than one function to fulfil It must pre 1 Address delivered at the opening of the New York State Museum in the State Education Build ing Albany N Y on the evening of December 29 1916 SCIENCE 7N S VOL XLV No 1149 sent to the people as a whole in vivid and yet truthful form knowledge of the nat ural objects of our countrysidethat is knowledge of naturein such a fashion as to be readily understood Moreover it must aid in the study of na turethat is in the study of soils insects plants birds and mammalsfrom the utili tarian standpoint Again it must aid the growing army of nature students the men and women who love nature or love science for the sake of nature or science without any set and im mediate utilitarian purpose This museum should keep aloft the standard of those who delight in all knowledge and all wisdom that can not be reduced to or measured by any money scale Finally this museum should perform the even more difficult task of giving research facilities to the extraordinary and excep tional student the man who has in him a touch of the purple the man who can sup ply that leadership without which it is so rare for even the laborious and welldi rected work of multitudes of ordinary men to realize the ideal of large productive achievement Little can be done save by cooperation and coordination We are fortunate in this state to have at the head of our educational system in President Finley a man whose ability to work by himself goes hand in hand with ability to work with others and with ability to train up others to work under him and who does all this in such fashion as to produce the maximum of benefit to the people as a whole No man has done more than he has done to secure for New York City a broadening of the standard of cultivation so as immensely to increase the number of persons who can profit thereby and at the same time to provide for the needs of those exceptional men and women who if given the chance will do work of such exceptional character that to the permanent impoverishment of mankind it will remain undone unless these exceptional persons are permitted to do it It is essential that this museum should command the services of many different men for work in many different fields and that its work should be so closely related to work of the same kind elsewhere that it shall all represent a coordinated whole This is true of all departments of its work but especially so of those departments which have a direct utilitarian bearing It is the farmer who benefits most from the utilitarian type of zoological work The rising generation will see a great change in the position of the farmer in our social economy our governmental activities are already in process of being turned to this end Most of the initial difficulties of con necting the farmer in fruitful fashion with the government have been at least partially overcome The book man and the closet man now understand that their science is worthless unless subjected to the test of actual conditions of life and labor And on the other hand the farmer has begun to understand that the most practical rule ofthumb man can profit by a wise use of the learning of the soil expert the plant expert or the expert in the knowledge of fungi and insects It is essential that the work of this sort in each state should be hitched on to the work in other states and in the federal capital if the best result is to be obtained In addition to this science which is of direct utilitarian bearing to this knowl edge of nature which can be scientifically applied to economic and agricultural bet terment there is science pursued for its own sake There is a twofold warrant for the encouragement of the study of pure science by the state In the first place the knowledge justifies itself The scientific student is justified 8 SCIENCEJANIARY 5 1917 because he studies science if he studies for a serious purpose exactly as is true of the man of arts or the man of letters Mere addition to the sum of the interesting knowledge of nature is in itself a good thing exactly as the writing of a beautiful poem or the chiseling of a beautiful statue is in itself a good thing A nation that does not understand this is not wholly civ ilized and a democracy that does not un derstand this can not claim to stand abreast of such a democracy as Athens in the past and France in the present In the next place the greatest utilitarian discoveries have often resulted from scien tific investigations which had no distinct utilitarian purpose Our whole art of navi gation arose from the studies of certain Greek mathematicians in Alexandria and Syracuse who had no idea that their dis coveries would ever have a direct material value It is impossible ito tell at what point independent investigation into the work ings of nature may prove to have an imme diate and direct connection with the bet terment of mans physical condition Most of the men and women indeed the immense majority of the men and women who work for pure science can not aspire to the position of leadership exactly as most business men can not expect to press into the ranks of the captains of industry Yet each can do work which is not only creditable and useful but which may at any time become literally indispensable in helping to discover some great law of na ture or to draw some great conclusion from the present condition or from the former physical history of the world This museum like all similar institutions should do everything possible to develop large classes of workers of this kind We must never forget however that the greatest need and the need most difficult to meet is to develop great leaders and to give full play to their activities Of course it must also be our aim to develop men who if they do not stand on the heights of great ness shall at least occupy responsible po sitions of leadership In the entirely proper effort to develop numbers of individual workers there must be no forgetfulness of the need of indi vidual leadership if American achieve ment in the scientific field is to be really noteworthy In the scientific as in the historical associations and academies this fact is sometimes forgotten Undoubtedly much that is indispensable has been done and much more can be done in the field of historical research by the collaboration of numbers of men But really great works will never be produced by such collabora tion The really great works must be pro duced by an individual great man who is able to use to the utmost advantage the indispensable work of a multitude of other observers and investigators He will be the first to recognize the debt he is under to these other observers and investigators if he does not do so he will show himself a poor creature On the other hand if they are worth their salt they will be proud to have the great architect use all the results of their praiseworthy and laborious and necessary labor in constructing the build ing which is to crown it Darwins epochmaking work would never have been done had not the founda tion been laid deep and wide by many acute and faithful observers But it needed the man of masterly genius to produce the great work I need hardly say that insistence upon the need of men of towering genius to do the supreme the epochmaking work does not in the least mean that there is not ut most need of firstclass work of the ordin ary type by the rest of us who are just ordinary men The best library is a mighty SCIENCE 9N S VOL XLV No 1149 poor library unless the immense majority of the books are by men who are not of epochmaking genius and in any com munity in which much firstclass scientific work is being done the bulk of it will be to the credit of men who do not pretend to belong to the highest category In the scientific as in every other field of en deavor here in the United States there is ample room for the man who can not be called a genius but who can do capital work Nevertheless it remains true that the thirdrate man can not produce first rate work and that from the standpoint of the world while it is well to help or train the thirdrate man to do his thirdrate work well what is of most importance is to give the firstrate man the training and the apparatus to do the firstrate work which unless he does it will not be done at all Let me give my statement more precision by speaking of just one small corner of the scientific field that with which I am most familiarthe study of ornithology and mammalogy In these fields there is need for work by experts who are only closet workers But there is far more need of work by field naturalists Most of all there is need of work by trained laboratory men who also possess a wide field experience As regards mammals there is still a good deal of work to be done in mere collecting but even as regards mammals and in finitely more as regards birds the days of the supremacy of the mere collector have passed This is true even of the least known parts of the earth and is infinitely more true here of New York The man who merely collects multitudes of bird skins or mammal skins and then goes over them with laborious minuteness in the study for the purpose of a classification which really represents primarily a fetishistic adora tion of a highly conventional and technical trinomial terminology must always occupy a humble and may readily occupy a merely useless position in the scientific world The ordinary pamphlet describing new subspecies and even new species differen tiated from one another by trifling char acteristics represents work which it is true possesses a slight usefulness but it is a use fulness not entitling the author to a grade much above that of the man who totes bricks in a wheelbarrow Ninetynine times out of a hundred these little pamph lets are of interest exclusively to rival and equally unimportant pamphleteers with slightly different views on terminology and on trivial questions of subspecific differ ences Generalizations based on sheer imagination or on imperfectly observed facts or on entirely insufficient data are at best useless and are apt to be mischievous Any type of honest work by the intellectual brickcollectors and wheelbarrow men is better than such dishonest attempts to pass off castles in the air as productive real estate But mere vast collections of minute facts which in themselves are of trivial importance without any attempt to ex plain and correlate these facts and with out cautious wisdom to generalize from them are of strictly limited usefulness Study of the interrelations of the lines of descent among birds and beasts is of ab sorbing interest Study of the compara tive effect of environment and heredity on physical structure is no less interesting There must be ample research in the labo ratory in order even to present these prob lems not to speak of solving them and there can be no laboratory study without the accumulation of masses of dry facts and specimens I do not for a moment mean that there should be any failure to recognize the need of such accumulation of facts But I do mean that there should be an equally clear recognition that the ac 10 SCIENCEJANUARY 5 1917 cumulation of facts is only the beginning that it is only laying the foundation on which the man of high ability must rear the superstructure I also mean that from now on it is essential to recognize that the best scientific men must largely work in the great outofdoors laboratory of nature It is only such outdoors work which will give us the chance to interpret aright the labo ratory observations In the New York State Museum Bulletin published last July there are pictures of two birds once common in America now totally extinct One is the passenger pigeon and the other the Labrador duck The passenger pigeon formerly existed in this state in millions and the Labrador duck was common off the coast The pas senger pigeon has been exterminated through sheer brutal reckless and largely wanton slaughter by our socalled civilized people The Labrador duck became ex tinct from causes of which we are abso lutely ignorant There are plenty of stuffed specimens of both in museums But in the case of neither do these stuffed speci mens throw any real light on the birds life history As regards the Labrador duck we shall in all probability never know the particulars of its life history nor the causes of its sudden extinction As re gards the passenger pigeon in its physical structure which in its essentials is strik ingly like that of our common mourning dove there is nothing which would give the least hint of its extraordinary habits of the innumerable myriads in which it moved fitfully hither and thither over the land and of the enormous extent of its shifting nesting sites There is now no other bird in the world with such habits and the stuffed specimens that remain of it do not all put together begin to equal in value the written records dealing with it in such old style natural histories as those of Wilson and Audubon There are many points in its lifes history which are still obscure and these points are obscure chiefly because so few of the many ornithologists who abounded in this country at the time of its extinction had any idea that their closet work in museums was of no consequence whatever compared to a thorough and care ful life study of the passenger pigeon The extinction of the passenger pigeon is a blot on our civilization and let me remark parenthetically that every society of this kind should be a focus of effort to prevent any of the birds we still have from follow ing in the wake of the passenger pigeon but inasmuch as it is extinct it is well for us to remember that we owe an incalculable debt to the observers who have left for us a record of its life history whereas we owe only a very small and easily calculated debt to those who merely collected speci mens of it for their collections Let the scientific man realize that he must be a good firsthand observer of wild things in their native haunts if he is to stand in the first rank of his profession Let him also remember that it is his busi ness to write well Of course he can not be expected to write as well as John Bur roughs but he ought to have writings like those of John Burroughs before him to rep cesent the ideal toward which he strives Let him strive to do original work the work of original productive scientific scholarship The New York Zoological Park under the guidance of Dr Hornaday the Ameri can Museum of Natural History in New York under the guidance of Mr Osborn and Mr Chapman have furnished models in this matter The three gentlemen named have done original productive scientific work of the highest value at the same time that they have in every way popularized not cheapened science and made the present and the past life history of this SCIENCE 1112 SCIENCE planet accessible in vivid and striking form to our people generally Their assistants have done hazardous and exceedingly in teresting and important work in the wild est of the waste spaces of the world It has been my privilege to journey through the East Central African wilderness and the Brazilian wilderness in company with out door faunal naturalistsMearns Heller Cherrie Miller Loringand myself to wit ness the hazard and the high value of their work and last winter I visited in Demerara Mr Beebes really extraordinary field lab oratory for intimate biological research in the tropics and I count it one of the privi leges and pleasures of my life to have worked with these men THEODORE ROOSEVELT

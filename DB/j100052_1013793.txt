J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1013793,INDUSTRIAL PEACE,I242679,INDUSTRIAL PEACE BY HON ARTHUR CAPPER UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM KANSAS BEFORE WE CAN PRESERVE INDUSTRIAL PEACE WE MUST ATTAIN IT HAS INDUSTRIAL PEACE EVER EXISTED HERE ARE FORCES ACTING AND COUNTERACTING HUMAN FORCES IN OPPOSITION TO ONE ANOTHER HUMAN PASSIONS AND APPE TITES ON THE ONE HANDECONOMIC LAWS AND FORCES OPERATING IMPLACABLY ON THE OTHER LET US UNDERSTAND AT THE OUTSET THAT ECONOMIC FORCES AND THEIR WAY OF OPERATING THROUGH FIXED LAWS CANNOT BE CHANGED WE OPPOSE THEM AT OUR PERIL IT IS PLAINLY OUR DUTY AND OUR HOPE TO STUDY THEM INQUIRE INTO THEM SCIENTIFICALLY AS WE INQUIRE INTO THE FORCES AND LAWS OF CHEMISTRY OR PHYS ICS WITH THE PURPOSE WHEN WE HAVE ACQUIRED KNOWLEDGE OF WHAT THEY ARE AND HOW THEY WORK OF ADJUSTING OUR SELVES TO THEM NOT OF TRYING IN SOME WAY TO CIRCUMVENT OR DEFEAT THEM WE MAY BE SURE THAT THEY WILL DEFEAT US UNLESS WE APPLY OURSELVES DILIGENTLY TO COOPERATING WITH THEM FOR THEY WILL SURELY HAVE THEIR WAY HUMAN NATURE IN INDUSTRY THE HUMAN FORCES ARE DIFFERENT OUR HUMAN PASSIONS AND APPETITES CANNOT BE CHANGED AS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY CONSTITUTED SO THEY ARE TODAY WE FIND IN THE DAWN OF HIS TORY THE SAME HUMAN CHARACTERISTICS EXPLOITING THEMSELVES AND OPERATING IN THE SAME WAY AS TODAY HUMAN NATURE WAS CONSTITUTED ONCE AND FOR ALL YET THE HUMAN FORCES ARE CAPA BLE OF ADJUSTMENT WE HAVE THE POWER TO CURB OUR PASSIONS AND OUR APPETITES IN THIS RESPECT MANKIND HAS INDEED MADE GREAT PROGRESS OUR NATURE IS UNCHANGED BUT WE HAVE IT UNDER BETTER CONTROL BECAUSE WE HAVE LEARNED FOR LONG GENERATIONS IN THE HARD SCHOOL OF LIFE THAT OUR INTEREST DOES NOT LIE IN THE EXERCISE OF UNRE STRAINED PASSION AND APPETITE AND WIL FULNESS BUT IN HOLDING OURSELVES WITHIN CERTAIN RESTRAINTS CONSIDERING PHYS ICAL LAWS AND FORCES ABOUT US AND CONSIDERING ALSO HUMAN AND SOCIAL FORCES ABOUT US SO THAT WE CONSIDER NOT ONLY OURSELVES BUT OTHERS AS WELL WHAT ALL THE WORLD MUST LEARN IS THAT WE LIVE MORE AND MORE A COMMON LIFE WITH COMMON AND NOT SEPARATE AND MUTUALLY HOSTILE INTERESTS THE COMMON INTEREST IF WE CAN DISCOVER IT IS OURS IN CONSIDERING THE PROBLEM OF CAPI TAL AND LABOR EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE HOURS OF LABOR AND WAGES CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT HEALTH AND SANITATION OF WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES CHILD LABOR AND THE LABOR OF WOMEN I GO BACK TO WHAT I STATED AT THE BEGINNING IT IS WHOLLY A MATTER OF TAKING HUMAN NATURE INTO CONSIDERATION HUMAN LAWS OF THINKING AND FEELING GOVERN THIS PROBLEM MEN CANNOT BE FORCED TO DO RIGHT THEY MUST BE LED THE INDUSTRIAL PROBLEM WILL NEVER BE SOLVED AND ITS SOLUTION WILL NEVER BE ADVANCED ONE STEP BY ABUSE AND DENUNCIATION AND EPITHETS PREJUDICE WILL NEVER SOLVE THIS HUMAN PROBLEM NO MAN CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ITS SOLUTION WHO HAS NO POWER OF GETTING THE OTHER MANS POINT OF VIEW ENTERING INTO HIS MIND AND APPRECIATING HOW HE LOOKS UPON LIFE AND WHAT HIS LIFE ACTUALLY IS 65THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY DEMOCRACY IN INDUSTRY I HAVE THOUGHT THAT AT PRESENT THE MOST PROMISING PROPOSAL OF ALL THE MANY FOR HELPING THE SOLUTION OF OUR INDUSTRIAL PROBLEM HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH LEGISLATION AT ALL BUT IS THE PRO POSAL THAT HAS SOMETIMES BEEN DE SCRIBED AS DEMOCRATIZING INDUSTRY THAT IS IT IS THE SOCALLED SHOP COUN CILS OR SHOP COMMITTEES PLAN BY WHICH GRIEVANCES ARE ANTICIPATED AND STRIKES AND LOCKOUTS AND STRIFE ARE ANTICIPATED BY THE PROMPT HEARING WHICH EVERY SMALL INDIVIDUAL GRIEV ANCE OBTAINS AT THE SHOP COUNCIL WE ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH THIS PLAN WHICH NEW AS IT IS HAS ALREADY BEEN PUT INTO OPERATION BY UPWARDS OF 200 AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WHICH IS SAID TO BE IN EFFECT IN A LARGE WAY IN ENG LAND AND WHICH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED BY THE GERMAN REICHSTAG FOR GERMANY IT IS DEMOCRACY IN INDUSTRY SO FAR AS SUCH MATTERS ARE CONCERNED AS RELATE TO EMPLOYMENT WAGES HOURS OF LABOR ETC THE MERIT OF THIS IDEA IS NOT SO MUCH TECHNICAL FOR TECHNICALLY THE PLANS DIFFER IN THE VARIOUS FACTORIES WHERE THEY HAVE BEEN PUT INTO OPERA TION BUT THE MERIT IS IN THE RECOGNI TION OF DEMOCRACY THE PRINCIPLE OF REP RESENTATION THE SENSE OF THE EMPLOYEE THAT HE IS A FACTOR ACKNOWLEDGED AND PERMITTED TO ACT TO AIR HIS IDEAS AND TO HAVE HIS GRIEVANCES CONSIDERED PROMPTLY AND WITHOUT PREJUDICE WHAT IS IT THAT WE WANT OF LABOR EVERYBODY AGREES THAT IT IS PRODUCTION WE WANT TO GET RID OF SLACKERISMAND SOLDIERING ON THE JOB WE WANT THE WORKER TO WORK THE COUNTRY HAS RUNG WITH THAT DEMAND UPON LABOR IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE WE WANT THE WORKER TO WORK TO GIVE A FULL RETURN FOR THE WAGES PAID HIM THAT IT IS VITAL TO CONSIDER THE WORKERS PSYCHOLOGY AND TO BUILD UP IN HIM THE DESIRE TO WORK BY CREATING IN HIM THE SENSE OF RECOGNI TION AND REPRESENTATION AS A MAN AND BROTHER IN INDUSTRY NOT AS A BEAST OF BURDEN THERE ARE EMPLOYERS SO IGNORANT OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF THEIR FELLOWMEN IN ANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES THAN THEIR OWN THAT THEY ARE DETERMINED BY EVERY DEVICE CONCEIVABLE TO THEM EVEN TO THE ENACTMENT OF LAWS TO DESTROY ORGANIZA TION ON THE PART OF LABOR WHILE COM PLACENTLY ACCEPTING ORGANIZATION ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYER THE CAPITALIST DOES ANY SANE MAN BELIEVE THE IN DUSTRIAL PROBLEM IS EVER TO BE SOLVED BY RANK INJUSTICE RATHER IT IS TO BE SOLVED BY JUSTICE BY CONSIDERING THE OTHER MAN BY GIVING HIM EVERY RIGHT AND PRIVILEGE THAT IS CLAIMED FOR THE INVESTOR OR THE EMPLOYER INDUSTRIAL PEACE IS NOT TO BE ATTAINED BY DENIALS OF RIGHT OR BY TRICKING MEN OUT OF THEIR RIGHTS THERE WAS PROFOUND HUMAN PHILOSOPHY IN THAT UTTERANCE OF THE ANGELIC CHORUS AT THE OPENING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERAPEACE ON EARTH GOOD WILL TO MEN I UNDERSTAND THAT MODERN SCHOLARSHIP TRANSLATES THEIR TRUE MEANING AS PEACE ON EARTH TO MEN OF GOOD WILL IN EITHER CASE IT IS SOUND DOCTRINE FOR PEACE CANNOT COME BY ANY OF THE METHODS OF ILL WILL NOR TO MEN OF ILL WILL BUT ONLY BY THE METHODS OF GOOD WILL AND TO MEN OF GOOD WILL THE EMPLOYER WILL SAY WHY NOT TELL THAT TO THE MEN WHO THREATEN TO STRIKE WHENEVER THEIR DEMANDS ARE NOT GRANTED TO THE MEN WHO SOLDIER ON THE JOB AND THINK ONLY OF THE PAY THEY GET NOT OF THE WORK THEY PERFORM FOR THEIR PAY THE LAW APPLIES TO THE CARPENTER THE BRICKLAYER AND THE PLUMBER JUST AS TO THE MILLIONAIRE CAPITALIST BUT SPEAK ING AS ONE WHO IS HIMSELF AN EMPLOYER OF A LARGE NUMBER OF MEN I SAY THAT THE EMPLOYER SHOULD FIRST SET THE EXAMPLE THAT THE EMPLOYER SHOULD TRANSLATE SOUND DOCTRINE WITHOUT WHICH THE INDUSTRIAL PROBLEM CANNOT BE SOLVED BY CONSIDERATION OF THE POINT OF VIEW OF 166INDUSTRIAL PEACE HIS MEN BY PAYING THEM A LIVING WAGE BY MINGLING WITH THEM AND LEARNING FROM THEM WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE WHAT THEIR JUST RIGHTS SHOULD BE THIS IS HIS BOUNDEN DUTY AND HIS SELFEVIDENT INTEREST THE TROUBLE IS THAT NEITHER SIDE CONSIDERS THE OTHER TO ANY GREAT EXTENT AND WHAT RESULTS IS PRECISELY WHAT SHOULD RESULT FROM ALL WE KNOW OF HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY THOSE EMPLOYERS WHO HAVE IMAGINED THAT THEY CAN WIN THE WORKER BY SOCALLED WELFARE SERV ICE ADMINISTERED FROM ABOVE LIVE IN A FOOLS PARADISE PRODUCTION THE INTEREST OF LABOR AND CAPITAL IT IS NECESSARY THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD BE REGARDED FOR WHAT IT ISA CO6PERA TIVE MUTUAL ENTERPRISE FOR THE COMMON GOOD THE END OF INDUSTRY IS PRO DUCTION NOT WAGES OR PROFITS THESE ARE BOTH INCIDENTAL TO THE MAIN END BOTH CAPITAL AND LABOR ARE SERVANTS OF THE CONSUMER GREATER PRODUCTION IS THE CONSUMERS INTEREST WHAT ELSE IS THE INTEREST OF LABOR OR OF CAPITAL THE GREATER THE PRODUCT THE LARGER THE WAGE FUND AND THE FUND OUT OF WHICH DIVI DENDS MAY BE PAID I COME BACK TO WHAT I STATED AT THE BEGINNING ECONOMIC LAWS CANNOT BE CHANGED LET US ASCERTAIN WHAT THEY ARE THEN LET US ADJUST OURSELVES TO THESE LAWS AND USE THEM FOR THE COM MON GOOD IF ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL LAWS ARE IN PERFECT HARMONY AS I BELIEVE THEY ARE THEN WE SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THEM FOR OUR OWN INTEREST IF THE LAWS OF HUMAN PSYCHOLOGY ARE IN HARMONY WITH ECONOMIC LAWS AS I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY ARE THEN THE MANAGER OF INDUSTRY CANNOT OVERLOOK HUMAN PSY CHOLOGY AND HAVE THE ECONOMIC RE SULTS HE DESIRES PROFITEERING AND ITS RESULTS WHILE WE WERE AT WAR WE HAD A SPLEN DID EXAMPLE OF WHAT CAN BE ACCOM PLISHED BY COOPERATION WHEN ALL WORK TOGETHER FOR THE COMMON GOOD MANY HOPED THAT THE WORLD WOULD AS A CON SEQUENCE OF AND IN SOME SENSE AS A COMPENSATION FOR THE AWFUL SACRIFICES AND COSTS OF HUMANITYS DEADLIEST WAR TURN ITS THOUGHTS AND ITS EFFORTS WITH A NEW SPIRIT TOWARDS A MORE UNSELFISH A MORE TOLERANT ORDER YET THE WAR WAS NO MORE THAN INLTER RUPTED BY THE ARMISTICE WHEN SELFISH NESS LEAPED INTO THE SADDLE AGAIN AND WITH ITS ARROGANT PROFITEERING ITS UGLY DEMAND PAY ME BUSINESS DE MANDS A PROFIT THAT WILL LAP UP ALL ITS SACRIFICES AND PUT ITS BOASTED PATRIOTISM ITS LOVE OF THE COMMON GOOD TO SHAME THERE IS NOTHING BEAUTIFUL IN THE FACT THAT BUSINESS PRESENTS NOTHING HOPEFUL IT HAS LAPSED INTO SHEER SELFISHNESS AND DRAGGED DOWN THE SPIRIT OF THE NATION IT IS AS IF THE WAR SPIRIT AFTER ALL WERE MERELY A TEMPORARY HYSTERIA ABNORMAL INSTEAD OF A PROOF THAT SOCIETY IS CAPA BLE OF WORKING TOGETHER IN HARMONY AND UNITY OF PURPOSE IN TOLERANCE AND MUTUAL GOOD WILL PROFITEERING IN ITS ARROGANCE AND ITS CRUDE RAW SELFISHNESS ITS WANT OF CON SIDERATION FOR THE COMMON GOOD HAS BE COME A STENCH IN THE NOSTRILS OF THE PEOPLE I SAY TO CAPITALISM AND TO BUS INESS THAT IT CANNOT BE MASTER IN THIS COUNTRY IT IS SERVANT IT CANNOT DOM INEER AND ORDER THE FAITHFUL LOYAL AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE 100 PER CENT AMERICAN BUT IT MUST LOOK TO ITS OWN DOORSTEP CLEAN ITS OWN HOUSE AND LEARN WHAT 100 PER CENT AMERICANISM REALLY SIGNIFIES BEFORE IT UNDERTAKES TO SET UP STANDARDS OF AMERICANISM FOR OTHERS WE ARE ALL SERVANTS AND NONE MASTERS OF THE COUNTRY THERE ARE NONE TO GIVE ORDERS AND TO SET UP STANDARDS BASED ON THEIR OWN SELFISH INTEREST IF ORGAN IZED LABOR IS THINKING OF NOTHING BUT THE INTEREST OF ORGANIZED LABOR THEN IT IS NOT 100 PER CENT AMERICAN NEITHER THE CAPITALISTIC PROFITEER NOR ORGANIZED 167THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY LABOR CAN BE MASTER BUT EACH MUST CONSIDER THE RIGHTS OF THE OTHER WHERE IS THE NEW SPIRIT THAT WAS TO COME OUT OF THE GREAT WAR HOW ARE WE PROFITING BY THE LESSONS THAT WE THOUGHT WE HAD LEARNED FROM THE MATE RIALISM OF GERMAN PRUSSIANISM THE SPIRIT OF THE MOST CRIMINAL ORGANIZATION IN THE WORLD WAS IN NO SENSE DIFFERENT FROM THE NARROW ARROGANT DOMINEERING SPIRIT OF SELFINTEREST THAT IS ABROAD IN OUR OWN COUNTRY TODAY IN PROFITEERING AND IN THE CLASS WAR OF CAPITAL AND OR GANIZED LABOR WE CAN EXERCISE THIS SPIRIT ONLY BY MUTUAL CONCESSIONS AND THESE ARE IM POSSIBLE WITHOUT FIRST THINKING AND THINKING HARD OF THE MUTUALITY OF OUR INTEREST AS I SEE CLASS WAR SUCCEEDING TO NATIONAL UNITY AS WE HAD IT DURING THE GREAT LIBERTY LOAN AND WELFARE DRIVES OF BUT TWO AND THREE YEARS AGO THAT PHRASE OF THE MASTER KEEPS RINGING IN MY EARS AS TRUE TODAY AS NEEDFUL AN ADMONITION AS IN ANY PERIOD OF HUMAN HISTORY YES MORE SO THE PREGNANT COMMAND TO EVERY SELFISH INTEREST YE MUST BE BORN AGAIN THERE CAN BE NO MASTERS WE ARE ALL SERVANTS ARROGANT DEMANDS FOR RIGHTS AND SPECIAL PRIV ILEGES AND ADVANTAGES MUST GIVE WAY TO THE SENSE OF SERVICE AND THE COMMON GOOD IT IS A SAYING OF BUSINESS THAT COM PETITION IS THE LIFE OF TRADE THIS IS TRUE I AM NOT TALKING FOR LESS ENERGY IN BUSINESS OR LESS COMPETITION WHICH SPELLS PROGRESS AND IMPROVEMENT BUT FOR COMPETITION IN SERVING THE COMMON WELFARE BY HONEST WORK HONEST GOODS AND HONEST PRICES THE PRESIDENT OF THE GREATEST WOOLEN MANUFACTURING CORPORATION PROBABLY IN THE WORLD THE OTHER DAY FELT CONSTRAINED TO ISSUE AFTER THE ANNUAL STATEMENT OF THE BUSI NESS AN APOLOGY FOR ITS UNGODLY PROFITS IT WAS ONLY SO MUCH ON A SUIT OF CLOTHES BUT IT WAS A COLLOSSAL AND INDEFENSIBLE NET PROFIT ON THE TOTAL BUSINESS THESE MEN PROFESS TO WORK FOR THEIR STOCKHOLDERS TURN OUT THE MAXIMUM OF PRODUCT THEY ARE NOT DOING IT THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR STOCKHOLDERS TO TURN OUT THE MAXIMUM OF PROFIT THE MAXIMUM PRODUCT IS WHAT WE ALL ARE DEMANDING OF LABOR AND CAPITAL ALIKE BUT THE MAXIMUM PRODUCT CAN BE AS SURED IN ONLY ONE WAY AND THAT IS BY CONSIDERING THE CONSUMERS ABILITY TO BUY BY FAIR PROFITS WHICH IMPLY REA SONABLE PRICES WHICH IN TURN STIMULATE WORK AND EFFORT IN THE HOPE OF CONSUMP TION THE FULLEST SATISFACTION OF NEEDS AND DESIRES PROFITEERING IS NOT GOOD ECONOMICS FOR IT DESTROYS THE MARKET PUTS TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF BUSINESS IN EFFECT BY PLACING GOODS BEYOND THEIR REACH IT IS NOT IN THE INTEREST OF MAX IMUM PRODUCTION AND MAXIMUM GEN ERAL PROSPERITY ITS MORAL AND SPIR ITUAL EFFECT IS TO INCITE CLASS WAR AND RECRIMINATION AND AN UGLY FEELING THAT IS AS FAR REMOVED AS POSSIBLE FROM PROMOTING MAXIMUM WORK AND PRODUCTION I BELIEVE THAT IF INDUSTRY WERE OR IF IT EVER SHALL BE CONDUCTED STRICTLY FOR THE COMMON GOOD RATHER THAN WITH REGARD PRIMARILY AS NOW TO PROFIT TO THE INDIVIDUAL THE RESULTS WOULD BE ASTONISHING TO THE AVERAGE MAN THAT PRODUCTION WOULD BE THE OBJECTIVE THEN OF BOTH EMPLOYER AND EMPLOYEE THAT THE OUTPUT WOULD BE SO LARGE THAT LABOR WOULD NOT BE OVERWORKED AND YET WOULD OBTAIN A MUCH GREATER INCOME IN ACTUAL GOODS THAN EVER BEFORE AND THAT FOR THE SAME REASON THE RETURNS TO THE INVESTOR WOULD BE IF NOT ANY GREATER THAN NOW OR IN MANY INSTANCES NOT SO GREAT YET MUCH STEADIER AND MORE CER TAIN I AM NOT SPEAKING OF INDUSTRY CON DUCTED BY THE STATE FOR WHICH I DO NOT HAVE THE SLIGHTEST SYMPATHY BUT INDUS TRY CONDUCTED AS PRIVATE ENTERPRISE WITH THE VIEWPOINT OF THE GREATEST POS SIBLE PRODUCT AT THE LEAST COST 168INDUSTRIAL PEACE AGRICULTURE THE BASIC INDUSTRY I BELIEVE THAT THE BASIC INDUSTRY OF ALL IS AGRICULTURE PRODUCING THINGS THAT ARE ELEMENTAL TO HFE THE FOOD BY WHICH WE LIVE SHOULD NOT ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES CONSIDER THAT OF FOOD THE FARMER UNTIL RECENT YEARS HAS NOT HAD THE POWER TO EXPRESS HIMSELF HE HAS LACKED THE FACILITIES TO ACT IN COMBINA TION OTHER INDUSTRIES ARE IN ADVANCE OF HIM IN THIS RESPECT WHILE HE REMAINS AND TO A DEGREE MUST BE AN INDIVIDUAL IST SO HE IS LIKELY TO FALL BEHIND IN THE RACE AND HAS FALLEN BEHIND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PAT HIM ON THE BACK AND SAY HE IS A GOOD FELLOW AND ADJURE HIM TO GO ON PRODUCING AND WORKING 12 OR 15 HOURS A DAY AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO PROVIDE HIM WITH AGRICULTURAL SCHOOLS WHERE HIS BOYS CAN BECOME TRAINED IN THE HIGHER AGRICULTURE THE STUDY OF SOILS AND THE CHEMISTRY OF PLANT LIFE WHAT IS THE USE OF ALL THIS EDUCATION FOR THOUSANDS OF FARM BOYS TENS OF THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR IF WHEN HE GOES OUT TRAINED TO TILL THE SOIL HE FINDS NO LAND UPON WHICH HE CAN SET TO WORK THE NATION AS A WHOLE MUST CON SIDER THE NEEDS OF AGRICULTURE AND AMONG THESE NEEDS IS THE PROVISION OF LAND FOR THE TRAINED YOUNG MEN TO TILL WE HAVE IGNORED THIS PROBLEM WE HAVE DRIFTED WITHOUT THOUGHT LETTING ECONOMIC LAWS WORK THEIR EFFECTS AND PERMITTING PRIVILEGE AND INJUSTICE TO HOLD THE WEALTH WHICH GOD HIMSELF PROVIDED THE LAND OUT OF USE FOR SPECULATIVE RETURNS WE ARE BY NO MEANS HELPLESS IN THIS MATTER FOR WE HAVE THE POWER OF TAXA TION AND WE HAVE NOT AVAILED OURSELVES OF IT TO CHECK LAND SPECULATION LETTING MATTERS DRIFT UNTIL LAND HAS ADVANCED TO SUCH PRICES THAT YOUNG MEN CANNOT OBTAIN IT NEED FOR A CONSTRUCTIVE PROGRAM FOR AGRICULTURAL INTEREST WE HAVE DONE NOTHING EITHER TO ASSIST TRAINED YOUNG MEN TO GET ON THE LAND THROUGH CREDIT ADVANCED BY THE COMMUNITY THERE IS NO BASIS OF CREDIT EQUAL TO LAND THIS WE HAVE KNOWN BUT NEVER HAVE HAD SUCH A RE MARKABLE PROOF OF IT AS DURING THE GREAT WAR IN THE FIVE YEARS OF THE CONFLICT IN EUROPE GERMAN IMPERIAL BONDS DE PRECIATED 22 PER CENT BUT IN THE SAME PERIOD GERMAN LAND BANK MORTGAGE BONDS DEPRECIATED ONLY 2 PER CENT OR LESS THAN OUR OWN LIBERTY BONDS HERE IS A STRIKING PROOF OF THE SUPREMACY OF THE LAND AS THE BASIS OF CREDIT A GREAT NEW YORK BANKER NOT MANY YEARS AGO TESTIFIED BEFORE A COMMITTEE OF CONGRESS THAT IN MAKING A LOAN HE CONSIDERED FIRST OF ALL THE CHARACTER OF THE APPLICANT HE WOULD LOAN TO A MAN OF LITTLE PROPERTY BUT OF TRUST WORTHY CHARACTER WHEN HE WOULD NOT TO A MAN WITH LARGE SECURITY BUT UNRE LIABLE CHARACTER IN THE GRADUATES OF OUR AGRICULTURAL COLLEGES WE HAVE YOUNG MEN OF CHARACTER WHO HAVE PROVEN THAT THEY POSSESS ENERGY AND INDUSTRY AND AMBITION WE CAN GIVE THESE YOUNG MEN CREDIT BASED UPON THEIR TRAINING THEIR CHARACTER AND THE LAND THEY TILL TODAY THE FARMER IS ORGANIZED THERE ARE A DOZEN GREAT NATIONAL FARM ORGANIZATIONS AND THROUGH THEM THE FARMER IS EXPRESSING HIMSELF AND IS BE ING HEARD LET US LISTEN TO WHAT THIS IMPORTANT INTEREST HAS TO SAY OF ITS PROBLEMS AND ITS NEEDS THE PLATFORMS AND RESOLUTIONS ADOPTED BY THE NA TIONAL FARMERS CONGRESS THE GRANGE THE SOCIETIES OF EQUITY THE FARM UNIONS THE FEDERATED FARM BUREAUS THE FARMERS NATIONAL COUNCIL THE NATIONAL BOARD OF FARM ORGANIZATIONS AND MANY BODIES REPRESENTING MORE PARTICULARLY CERTAIN BRANCHES OF AGRI CULTURE AS DAIRYING AND LIVESTOCK SPEAK THE FARMERS MIND AND IT IS SURPRISING HOW LARGELY THEY ARE IN AGREEMENT THE NATION MUST GIVE MORE HEED TO THESE UTTERANCES FROM THE 169THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PRODUCERS OF FOOD AS TO THE RIGHTS AND INTERESTS OF AGRICULTURE THE FARMERS ARE ASKING NO SPECIAL FAVORS INDEED THEY ARE VERY MUCH OP POSED TO SPECIAL PRIVILEGES TO ANY CLASS BUT IF THERE IS ANYTHING MORE FUNDA MENTAL THAN GETTING ENOUGH FOOD FOR THE PEOPLE I HAVE NEVER HEARD OF IT MOREOVER UNLESS WE DO SOME REAL THINK ING ALONG THIS LINE THERE WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE HUNGRY ONE OF THESE DAYS IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT A CONSTRUCTIVE PRO GRAM BE ADOPTED AT ONCE WHICH WILL GIVE THE AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS OF THIS COUNTRY A FAIR CHANCETHAT WILL ENABLE FARMERS TO DEVELOP THEIR BUSINESS EDU CATE THEIR CHILDREN AND WORK INTO THE MOST EFFICIENT PRODUCTION OF FOOD THE FIRST THING IS TO CURB THE PROFI TEERS AND SUPPLY AGRICULTURAL ESSENTIALS SUCH AS LUMBER AGRICULTURAL IMPLE MENTS CLOTHING SHOES AND THE LIKE AT AN HONEST PRICE WE MUST ALSO ENCOURAGE LEGISLATION CURBING MANIPULATION OF THE MARKET AND GAMBLING BY THE GRAIN PROVISION AND STOCK EXCHANGE SHARKS WHO SEEK TO CONTROL UNJUSTLY THE SUPPLY AND THE PRICES OF FOODSTUFFS COTTON AND OTHER NECESSITIES OF LIFE WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE FEDERAL SUPERVISION OF THE PACKING INDUSTRY A FURTHER EXTENSION IN COOPERATION IS NEEDED IN BOTH COUNTRY AND CITYIT IS ESSENTIAL IN BUILDING UP THE AGRICUL TURAL INTERESTS THERE SHOULD BE LEGIS LATION TO REMOVE ALL ARTIFICIAL RESTRIC TIONS ON THE SALE OF FARM PRODUCTS CLEARLY ESTABLISHING THE RIGHTS OF FARM ERS TO COLLECTIVELY MARKET THEIR OWN PRODUCTS WITHOUT LEGAL OR OTHER INTER FERENCE WE MUST WORK OUT A BETTER SYSTEM OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING AND SUPPLY FOOD AT A LOWER COST WHILE MAKING MORE THAN THE COST OF PRODUC TION ITSELF LETS TRY TO STOP THIS LANDSLIDE FROM THE COUNTRY INTO THE CITIES LETS GET A VISION OF WHAT THIS GREAT NATION CAN BE WITH ITS INDUSTRIAL AND BUSINESS LIFE WORKING IN HARMONY AND PERFECT COOP ERATION WITH THE AGRICULTURAL INTERESTS AND WITH PLENTY OF FOOD FOR EVERY ONE AT PRICES WHICH THE WORKERS CAN AFFORD TO PAY AND YET WHICH WILL SUPPLY MODERN COUNTRY HOMES AND OTHER ES SENTIALS FOR FARMERS BETTER SCHOOLS MODERN HOMES SOCIAL ADVANTAGES AND A GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE BRIGHTER THINGS OF LIFE ARE ESSENTIAL A PROGRAM FOR THE FUTURE THESE ARE TOPSYTURVY TIMES BUT THERE NEVER WAS A TIME WHEN BEING UNSELFISH WAS SUCH ENLIGHTENED SELFISH NESS AS NOW I BELIEVE WE SHOULD ALL SIT TIGHT STAY BY OUR JOBS AND STAND BY OUR COUNTRY MANY THINGS ARE BADLY MIXED HERE AT HOME BUT THEY ARE NOT GOING TO REMAIN MIXED TO RESTORE NORMAL CONDITIONS IT WILL RE QUIRE THE UNSELFISH COOPERATION OF PATRIOTIC AMERICANS OF ALL WALKS OF LIFE OF COURSE WE HAVE TREMENDOUS PROB LEMS BUT WE HAVE ONLY TO KEEP OUR HEADS AND BE REALLY AND TRULY THANKFUL THAT WE ARE AMERICAN CITIZENS TO COME THROUGH OUR DIFFICULTIES WE MUST ALL UNITE TO WIN THE RIGHT CONDITIONS IN PEACE TIMES JUST AS WE UNITED TO WIN THE WAR THEN THIS GREAT NATIONAL READJUSTMENT WILL BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHOUT HARDSHIP AND THE NATION WILL NOT FEEL THE STRAIN WHICH OTHERWISE WILL BE HEAVY POSSIBLY TO THE BREAKING POINT WE MUST APPLY THE PRINCIPLE OF THE GOLDEN RULE AS NEVER BEFORE WE NEED MORE OF THE SPIRIT OF FAIR PLAY BE TWEEN MAN AND MAN IT IS A POOR TIME FOR STRIKES AND FOR STRIFE GREATER INDUSTRY HARDER WORK MORE RIGID ECONOMY IN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EXPENDI TURES DOING WITHOUT ALL LUXURIES AND ABOVE EVERYTHING ELSE INCREASED PRO DUCTION ARE TODAY AS SOLEMN A DUTY UPON ALL ALIKE AS THEY WERE DURING THE CRISIS OF THE WAR I HAVE FAITH IN THE 170INDUSTRIAL PEACE COMMON SENSE AND STEADFAST PATIENCE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE COMMON SENSE AND THE PATIENCE THAT WAS TYPI FIED AND DEIFIED IN LINCOLN IT IS A TIME ESPECIALLY WHEN PARTISAN SHIP MUST BE PUT ASIDE AND EVERY MAN MUST COOPERATE TO THE UTMOST OF HIS ABILITY AMERICAN INITIATIVE AMERI CAN PLUCK AMERICAN INVENTIVE GENIUS A THOROUGHGOING AMERICAN POLICY AND THE REAL AMERICAN SPIRIT MUST BE BACKED UP AS NEVER BEFORE WITH TRUE AMERICAN STATESMANSHIP I HAVE THE UTMOST CONFIDENCE THAT WE SHALL MEET THESE GREAT PROBLEMS IN A WAY THAT BEFITS AMERICA AND HER DESTINY 171

Cave on Crooked creek with Remarks and Ob servations on Nitre and GunPowder by Samuel Brown M D of Lexington Kentucky Read February 7tb Mo6 THERE are few works on Natural Histoiy or Chemistry wlfich do not contain some facts or opinions concerning the formation and properties of nitre To recapitulate these facts236 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE or to state the various tlheories to which they have given rise would be a task very different from that wlicih I hiave underta ken which is merely to communicate a short accoutit of some of the most remarkable cavernls and rocks from which that salt is obtained in Kentucky and to offer some conjectures re lative to the causes of the imnpertection of the gunipowder ma nufactured in the United States The quality of the nitre procured from the earth in calcare ous caverns is universally believed to be different from that which is found in the sand rocks I have not been able to as certain witlh any degree oti precision the quantity annually manuifactured in this State nor the lnumber of caverns which are kniown to contain it I hiave however visited several of the most remarkable of them and from the best iniformation I could procure I hlave formed the ibliowing estimate The great cave on Crooked creek s of Nitre a branch of Rock castle supposed to contain   100000 Scotts cave two miles distant from the great cave 200000 Daviss cave six miles distant from the great cave 500oo Two other caves within a mile of the great cave 20000 A cave on Rough creek a branch of Green river 10000 Besides tlhese wlich I hlavc lhad an opportunity of examin ing I lhave hieard of many others in various parts of the State somie of wlhich are esteemed very rich in nitre and are said to be of great extent The great cave on Crooked creek in Madison county is situat ed about 60 miles south east of Lexington It has two mouths which are 646 yards distant from eacth other and about i5o yards from a large creek whieh winids round the hill througi whiclh the cave affords a commodious passage for horses and waggons The general level of the floor of the cave is 80 feet above the creek The average hiciglht of the arclh is ten feet tlhough in mnany places it rises to fifty or sixty Thlie breadth of the passage is genierally about forty feet in some parts it is seventy or eighty feet T lie floor hias tlhe appearanice of a large public road whichi has been muclh frequented The ceiling is iin most places smooth with but few incrustations orstalac tites In some of the chambers however there are appearancesaESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 231 of Gothic rudeness and irregularity which are truly sublime When these vast chamnbers are sutifcienitly illuminated by the torclhes and lamps ot the workmen they present scenes so in conimumo and so romnanitic that thie most stupid beholder can not contemplate thiemi witlhout cxpressions oi the greatest asto nishimenit During the winter season the eltect of these scenes is greatly increased by a stream of water whiiclh issuing ironi a small openinig in the arcih of the cave about twenity leet above the flour and falling into a bason occasions a noise whiich in these caln regions cain be lheard at great distanice and echoing from arclh to archi fills the mind with the idea of somue migh ty cataract Tihe temperature of this cave during the last winter the coldest we have had for several years was generally 52 of F sonictinies the mercury rose as hiigh as 57 but never sunk to the freezing poilnt whien the thiermometer was placed at any considerable distance within the cave In onie chiamber how ever the h1eat was frequently so great as to be disagreeable About sixty paces from the south entrance a passage leading from the main avenue coniducts you to this chamber whiichi is nearly circular and about twenty feet in liameter The arch over this part of the main avenue and that over the passage leading to the warm chamber are equally elevated But the ceilinog of the chamnber is twenty or thirty feet higher As you approach the chamber the floor gradually rises until it ascends above the level of the arch of the passage As soon as you ascend above that level you perceive the air uncommonly warn even when the temperature of the passage is near the freezing point The air which fills the main avenue in sum mer and autumn is forced into this clhamber whlenever the ex ternal atmospheric air becomes so much condensed by cold as This cave was discovered about seven years ago by a Mr Baker Hc entered it by the north mouth but proceeded only a small distatnce into it oni the succeeding day he brought his wife and two or three of their childitn to explore it hecarried a torch and his wife a supply of pine Aftcr they had advanced within hearing of this torrent 400 or 5oo yards from the north nmouth the only otac the knoDwn he dropped his torch and it was completcly cetinguished Duripg two days and two nights this miserable famlly wandertd in total darkness without provisiotis and without water thoagh sometimes within hearing of a cataract which they durst not approach at length Mrs Baker in attempting to support herself on a rock perceived that it was wet she conjectured that this was caused by the mud which they had brought iu on their fect Baker immediatey ascended the rock and saw the light of day238 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE to rush into the mouth of the cave and whenever during the winter any portion of air in the main avenue where the pas sage leads off is accidentally heated by fires or by carrying torchles or lamps through the cave as this heated air cannot escape by the mouth of the cave for the arch descends to wards the mouth it ascends into this chamber and rises to the ceiling where it must remain until the external air and that in the passage and avenue acquire a higher temperature than tlhe air in the chainber This chamber then is constructed pre cisely upon the principles of the Russian vapour bath so mi nutely described by count Rumford During the winter season the walls and floor of this cave re main perfectly dry but in summer innumerable drops of water collect upon the rocks and trickle down upon the floor whiclh somnetimes becomes as moist as a bed of mortar This is particularly the case during very hot weather when the at mosplhere is loaded with vapours I collected a quantity of the liquid condensed upon the rocks and found that it possess ed the same properties with the liquor obtained by lixiviating the earth on the floor of the cave It would appear from this fact that the nitric acid is formed in the cave and is conden sed upon the rocks the lime of which it dissolves But in what manner this nitric acid is formed I confess myself whol ly ignorant as there are no substances in a state of putrefaction within the cave which could yield the requisite supply of ni trogene gas It is to be remarked that the whole of the wa ter condensed upon thie rocks does not taste of the nitrate of lime A great part of it is quite insipid although dropping upon earth which is rich in nitre and many parts of the cavern have been found so completely filled with clay that it is not easy to conjecture how it was possible for atmospheric air to reach them and this clay too is strongly impregnated with nitrate of lime The depth of the earth on the floor of this cave has never yet been ascertained In some places the work men have dug down fifteen feet and the earth even at that depth still contains nitre It is commonly supposed that through out the cave every bushel of earth contains at least one pound of nitre In many places it will yield more than two poundsDESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 239 to the bushlel Formerly the eartlh was taken out of the cave and lixiviated near the stream at present hoppers are erected in the cave and the earth after lixiviation is left to be impreg nated again with nitrate of lime but wlhat lengtll of time will be requisite to saturate it lhas ot yet been ascertained The workmen hiave dilerent modes of forming an opinion with regard to the quantity of nitre with wlhich the earth may be impregnated Th ley generally trust to their taste but it is always conisidered as a proof of the presence of niitre when the impressioni miiade oln the duist by the lhand or foot is in a very slhort tliie effaced Wlhere the nitre is very abundant the impression made today wvill be scarcely visible tomorrow Whlere tlhere is a great deal of santd mixed with the duist it is commnonly believed that a smiall quantity of potash will suf fice for the saturation of the acid Tlhe metlhod of making saltpetre usually piactised in Ken tucky is as follows The earth is dug and carried to hoppers of a very simple construction wvhiclh cointaiii about fifty bushels cold water is poured oni it fromn tinme to time and in a day or two a solutioni of the salts runls inito trouglhs placed beneath the lhoppers The lixiviationi is continiued as long as any strength remains in the eartlh The liquor is then put into iron kettles and heated to ebullition it is afterwvards thlrown uponi a lopper containing wood aslhes tlhouglh whiich it is suffered to filtrate As the alkaline part of tlle aslhes is disclharged before the nitrate passeg thlrough the first ruinninigs of this lhopper are tlhrowni back and after some time the clear solution of nitrate of potasli ruLns out mixed witlh a wlhite curd which settles at the bottom of the trough This clear liquor is boiled to the point of crys tallization then settled for a slhort time and put inito troughis to crystallize where it remains twentyfour hours the crystals are then taken out and the mothierwater tlhrown uponi the ash hopper witlh the next running of the nitrate of lime When the quantity of the nitrate of limne is too great for the portion of ashes employed the workmen say their saltpetre is in the  grease and that they do not obtain a due quantity of nitre If there has been too great a proportion of ashes employed I240 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE they say it is in the  ley and wlhen it is left to settle previouLs to crystallization a large quantity of salt will be deposited in the settling troughs whichl they call  cublc salts These salts are again thrown upon the ashhoppers and are supp6sed to assist in precipitating the lime from the nitrate of lime anid in the opinion of the workmen are changed into pure saltpe tre They consider this salt as nitre killed as they express it by the excessive strenigth of the ley To make 100 pounds of good saltpetre At the great cave eighiteen bushels of oak ashes are necessary ten of elm or two of ashes made by burninlg thie dry wood in lhollow trees In the discovery Qf thle value of this latter kind of ashes the plhilosophers and chiemists of Europe have been anticipated by the saltpetremakers of Ken tucky The earth in some caves does not require lhalf this quantity of ashies to precipitate the impure salts When wood ashes cannot be readily obtained near the caves the liquor whiclh runs from the earth in the lhoppers is boiled down to the point of crystallization and suffered to be come solid by coolinig In this form wlhich is called  thick stizffJ it is transported to a part of the country wlhere aslhes can be procured dissolved in ley sufficienitly strong to precipi tate the lime settled in troughs and tlcn boiled down anid crystal lized This thick stuff is extremely liable to deliquesce in warm moist weatlher and is therefore commonly melted down and put into casks before it is carried from the caves

and the modes commonily employed for obtaininig that salt I shall mention some of the most remarkable circumstan  See Vol X p 330 Philowphkal MagzincDESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 24 1 ces which have come to my knowledge relative to the rock ore or sand rocks whlich yield nitre supposed to possess pecii liar qualities These sand rocks are genierally situated at the hiead of a ra vine or narrow valley lead tip a steep hill or nmountain as cending the streamlets which run througlh these valleys the banks close in upon you and becomie perpendicular The rocks are frequently from sixty to one hundred feet in height and jutting over their bases which rest on a calcareous stratum often form a shelter large enough to secure a thousand men from the iniclemencies of the weather During the winter season a small rill is precipitated from the top of these rocks and in sumnmer water generally issues from between the silicious and calcareouLs strata These sand rocks which probably once formed a com plete upper stratum have been for ages exposed to the destruc tive operations of rains and frosts and as they crumble off are carried by torrents into the plains and rivers beneath The stummits of all the hills in the vicinity of Rock castle Licking and Sandy are still covered by mnasses of these rocks which from their beauty and variety of figure might at a small dis tance be mistaken for the ruins of Gothic cathledrals or Baroniial castles Vast blocks of them lhave rolled down into the valleys at a period of time so remote that they are now covered by trees of a luxuriant growth These rocks when broken per penidicularly present a surface consisting of strata so irregular with regard to their position and so different in colour and in the size of the particles of sand that it is impossible to doubt of their NTeptunian origin Theihinute inspection of them never fails of awakening in the nmind the recollection of the slhore of some vast lake whlere the rage of the winds anid the vwaves lhas piled uip hills of sand which time consolidates into rock Several years ago the saltpetremakers discovered that the sand and rubbish sheltered from rains by these rocks contained a richi impregnation of nitre and that only a small portion of ashes was necessary fpr its purification They soon after found that the sand rock itself tasted strongly of saltpetre and immiiediately commnenced the new methiod of working2412 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE After blowing off large blocks of the rock they break them into small pieces with hammers and throw them into kettles containing boiling water as soon as the rock falls into sand by the action of the hot water upon it they put it into hoppers and waslh out all the nitre by frequent additions of cold water this solution is boiled down and crystallized without any mixture of ashes or potash Sometimes when the motlherwater has been very often added to fresh solutions of the nitre they find it ne cessary to use a very small quantity of ashes I have been informed by a Mr Fowler that he and his as sociates have made saltpetre at tiventyeight different rock lhou ses or caverns from whichi tleJy have obtained about 100000 pounds of nitre all these are situated on the north side of Ken tucky river within seventy miles of Lexington He remarks that he has never seen a rock facing the inorth or west wlhich was very rich in nitre He hias always desisted from working a rock whlen it failed to yield hiim ten pounds to tthe bushel of sand He has often obtained twenty or tlhirty pounds per bush el He assured me that he once discovered a nmass of very pure nitre which was found to weigh 1600 pounds Mr Foley another saltpetremaker found one containing 100 pounds anotlher mass was found on Rock castle wvhich report says weighed 500 pounds I lhave now in my possession a solid mass of native nitrate of potaslh of singular purity whiich weighs three pouinds it is more than four inches in thickness anld is only a small portion of a block of nitre found last sum mer on Licking river I have likewvise a number of smialler specimens which I myself procured from the different caves which I visited some weeks ago These are generally found between the rocks whiich have fallen from the cliff or the cre vices of those rocks which still remain in their primitive situa tion The rocks which contain the greatest quantity of nitre are extremely difficuilt to bore and are generally tinged with a brownish or yellow ocre colour Sometimes they contain an oxide like manganese and sometimes great quantities of iron ore whiich resembles the bark of the scaly bark hickory sur rounded by a finely powdered brown oxide At some of these rock houses three hands can make one hunidred pounds of goodDESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 243 nitre daily but forty pounds may be considered as the average product of the labour of three men at those works which I had an opportunity of visiting The workmen being badly provided with tools and appara tus desert a rock whenever its size or hardness renders it diffi cult for them to manage it and go in quest of a new establish ment Several caves and rocks whiclh tlhese strolling clhemists hlave deserted still contain many thousand pounds of nitre These men are continually searching for masses of pure nitre or rich veins of ore by whiclh much of their time is unprofita bly dissipated Still however most of our saltpetremakers find it their interest to work the sand rock rather tthan the calcareous caverns whiclh last yield a mixture of nitrate of potash and nitrate of lime Thie rock saltpetre is greatly preferred by our merchants and powdermakers and commands a Ihigher price Mr Barrow in his travels tlhrough the sotuthern parts of tlic continent of Africa discovered native nitre which is probably similar to the rock saltpetre of Kentucky But Bowles Dillon and Townishend assure us that those districts in Spain whiclh afford nitre most abundantly contain neither chalk limestone gypsum nor any other calcareous substance The nitrate of potash is obtained there by filtrating a certain kind of black mould which will continue for ages to yield annuial supplies of it together witlh muriate of soda sulphate of magnesia nitrate and sulphate of lime lere then appears to be such a relation existing between the different saline substances botl acids and alkalies that the causes whiclh produce one of them owing to some yet undiscovered circumstance regularly pro duce all the rest According to these authors the same mould will continiue forever to yield these salts annually rlTlis obser vation if correct would induce us to believe tlriat botlh acids and alkalies are wlholly formed from atmospheric air anld Inot from the soil as the soil would certainly be exlhausted if any considerable portion of it entered into the composition of eitiler the acids or alkalies and would soon lose its power of attract ing from the air the other constituent principles of the salts Botlh in Spain and India we are informed that the mould whiclh for fifty years in succession has yielded nitre still coi244 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVI tinues to afford it in undiminislhed quantities But how sliall we reconcile this fact with that before related concerning the production of nitre in the cavities of calcareous mountains whichi are in many instances so closely filled up with clay that the air can have no access from whlich every ray of solar liglht is excluded and where the temperature can never exceed 57 of Fahrenlheit Is it absolutely certain that nitre formed by natural processes so very dissimilar possesses no properties iecessarily resulting from the circumstances attendant oni its formation That all the niitrates of potaslh vith wlhiclh we are acquainted lhave certain properties in which they agree is uln qtuestionable but the same may be said of lime and barytes of soda and potaslh and manv otlher substances which in tlle early ages of chemical scicnce were probably identified IHoflinan long ago proved that nitrate of potash aflorded an alkali very different from that of wood ashies or salt of tartar The observations of so distinguished a phiilosopher deservc mnuch attention and hiis experiments if repeated by nmoderni chemists could scarcely fail of affordinig important results that the sanid rock salhpetre differs fromn that procured from the cal careous cavernis in tlle form of tlle crystal in hardlness anid dryness is known to all who deal in that article anid every powdermaker affirms that it makes better gunlpowder Who tlher this stuperiority is owilng merely to its greater purity or exemption from an admixture of nitrate of lime or wlhetlher the constituent acid anid alkali are modified in some unknown manner is yet altogether problematical Clhaptal Thouverel Guyton and indeed most of tlhe modern chemists suppose thlat potaslh is a compound of lime and hiydrogcn and that lime itself is formed of carbon azote and lhydrogen and coni sequently that potash consists of hydrogen carbon anld azofe M1r Guyton tliinks that soda is cotmposed of magnesia and hy drogen and that magnesia is a compound of lime anid azote and therefore that soda is made up of hydrogen carbon and azote He is then of opinion that potash soda lime and magnesia are notlhing more than varied forms and proportions of the same constituent ingredients differing from eaclh other in the qtuantities and forces of attraction This opinioni dewDESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 245 rives great probability from ani experiment of Bishop Watson by which it would appear thlat soda was acttually converted iiito potash It is likewise corroborated by the a4parent con version of lime and soda into potash in our calcareous caverns and by the change of wlhat the workmen callcubic salts into niitrate of potash Trhouverel affirms that he witnessed the real conversion of waslhed chalk into potash in his experi ments on nitrous vapours and Chaptal observed the same phe nomenon when exposing clhalk to the vapours of putrid bul locks blood Now as the nitric acid combines readily with lime soda and magnesia as well as with potash it nay be easily conceived that it still retains its affinity for those substan ces in every form which they may assume nhilst cbanging into each otlher and that tlhe tertium quid formed by the union of nitric acid and lime in the intermediate stage between limne and putash mnay possess properties very different from ni trate of lime or nitrate of potash The same lmay be remark ed with regard to soda and magnesia Here every chemist will recollect the ingenious observations of Dr Mitchel con ceriling nitric acid anfd the essential differences between that substance and septic acid at the moment of its formation No person can doubt of the possibility of charging nitrogeno with differenit portions of oxegen The explosive efficient pro perty of nitre may depend on a certain dose of this principle Btut even admitting that potash and nitric acid never vary in their nature it may still be contended that powdermakers have no means of ascertaining what proportion of acid and alkali that nitre ought ta contain which would form the best gunpowder And whilst this is confessed it surely can avail us little to be very scrupulous in the adjustment of the propor tions of the nitre to the charcoal and sulphur The consumers of potash in every part of the world have remarked varieties in the quality of the salt for which no particular cause can be assigned It is very much to be regretted that a regular series of experiments has never been instituted to discover what kind of ashes would yield an alkali most proper for the for mation of nitre Charcoal should be examined with a similar view Mr Coleman has published experiments and remarks246 DESCRIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE on this subject Philosophiccal Magazine V IX p 35 5 wliclh appear to me very interesting By his mode of distilling wood in iron cylinders he deprives it completely of all the volatile oil hydrogenous gas anld pyroligneous acid The charcoal prepared in this way possesses uniformly the same properties and by the employment of it the powder now used in the British ordnance is increased in strength one third The gunpowder manufactured in the United States is said to he defective from a disposition either to effloresce or de liquesce The salts nmost liable to effloresee are such as have soda for their base In many of our saltpetre caves small quantities of the sulphate of soda have been discovered which for want of sufficient care or skill in refining are suffered to remain with the nitre The disposition to efflorescence ap pears to he directly opposite to that of deliquiescence as nll the one case the air hias a stronger affinity for the water of combination of the salt than that which exists in the salt for the water in the other case the salt attracts moisture from its combination with air It would seem then thiat as the air is capable of depriving the sulphate of soda of its water of conmbination and as nitrate of lime attracts moisture from the sturrouniding air it is possible that a mixture of these two salts may be so made with niitrate of potash that the niitrate of lime may deprive the sulplhate of soda of its water of conrbi nation and in consequence of tlis addition of water deli quescenice may ensue even whlen the atmosphieric air and mloisture are excluded If Count Rumford is correct in sup posing that the explosive force of gunpowder depends not upon the evolution of permanently elastic fluids or gases but upon the almost instantaneous conversion of the water of con bination existing in the powder into steam by the caloric re sulting from its inflamnmation this explosive force may be di minished for want of that water which miglht have escaped by efflorescence or on account of the slow combustion of the pow der consequent on deliquescence A concern for the glory anid defence of our country slhould prompt such of our chemists as have talents anid leisure to in vestigate this interesting subject In 1776 at the request ofDESCrIPTION OF A NITRE CAVE 247 M Turgot the celebrated M Lavoisier was appointed super intendant of the French national powder works and with what success he executed the duties of his important commission the history of their subsequent naval campaigns have sufficiently evinced Tne efforts of European chemists seem to have been principally directed to the reimoval of the marine salt wlhich the nitre of Spain and India contains in great quantities In the nitre of Kentucky I hlave never detected a particle of that salt and I am confident that if any is found in it the pro portion must be very inconsiderable indeed The rock salt petre I am persuaded would with very little refinement make gunpowder capable of retaining its efficient properties during the longest voyages as I have never discovered in that species of nitre the smallest tendency either to deliquescence or efflo rescence It will be observed that I have not in this paper hazarded any opiniion with regard to the formation of nitre in our sand rocks I freely confess that I have no theory on that subject which is satisfactory to my own mind I am even disposed to suspect that our greatest chemists have still much to learn with regard to tlis salt so valuable in time of peace so indispensa ble in time of war

THE END OF THE SECTION A TYPICAL LEGISLATUREWE COPY FROM THE WEEKLY LAW BULLETIN THE FOLLOW ING REMARKS BY JUDGE SHAUCK OF THE SUPREME COURT OF OHIO MADE IN RESPONSE TO THE TOAST  THE SUPREME COURTOUR VICTIMS AT A BANQUET HELD BY THE MEM BERS OF LEGISLATURE OF THAT STATE FEBRUARY 16 1899  EMLBARRASSMENT IS INEVITABLE WHEN ONE WHO CAN NOT BE HUMOROUS TO ORDER IS REQUIRED TO SPEAK UPON AN OCCASION WHICH DISCOURAGES SERIOUSNESS ALL MOTION MENTAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL IS ALONG THE LINE OF THE LEAST RESISTANCE AND IT RE QUIRES LESS RESOLUTION TO FACE DISCOURAGEMENT THAN TO ATTEMPT THE IMPOSSIBLE IT IS HOWEVER PLEASANT AND APPROPRIATE TO ADVERT TO SOME PRESENT SUBJECTS OF CONGRATULA TION ONE OF THESE IS OUR PRESENCE ON THIS FESTIVE OCCASION DEMONSTRATING THAT YOU WHO HAVE ORGANIZED AND MANAGED THIS COMBINATION TO STIMULATE HAPPINESS HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENTLY ADROIT TO ELUDE THE VIGILANCE OF THE ATTORNEYGENERAL HAD YOU BLUNDERED INTO DETECTION AT LEAST ONE MORE ACTION IN QUO WARRANTO WOULD HAVE BEEN ADDED TO THE MISERIES OF YOUR VICTIMS ANOTHER SUBJECT OF CONGRATULA TION IS THE SERENITY WHICH PERVADES THE STATE FROM THE LAKE TO THE RIVER THIS BY A SUPERFICIAL OBSERVER MIGHT BE ATTRIBUTED TO THE REVIVAL OF BUSINESS OR TO THE HAPPY TERMINATION OF THE SPANISH WAR OR TO OUR IMMUNITY FROM THOSE PESTILENTIAL DISEASES WHICH BRING OUR BODIES TO THE DUST BUT THE PHILOSOPHIC OBSERVER GUIDED BY AN ACCURATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PROPORTIONS OF CAUSES TO EFFECTS WILL UNERRINGLY ATTRIBUTE THIS SERENITY TO THE FACT THAT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY IS NOT IN SESSION ONE YEAR AGO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE WERE ANXIOUSLY VISITING TLHE TELEGRAPH STATIONS AT NIGHT AND NERVOUSLY SCANNING THE MORNING PAPERS BEFORE BREAKFAST TO LEARN WHATANCIENT DEVILTRIES HAD BEEN REVIVED OR NEW ONES INVENTED IN THE GENERAL ASSEM BLY BUT NOW THE APPREHENSION OF FURTHER PERIL IS ABSENT TRUE THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE PREVAILING HAPPINESS IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE YOU WERE IN SESSION FOR FOUR MONTHS A YEAR AGO OTHER GENERAL ASSEMBLIES VERY LIKE YOU HAD HELD SESSIONS FOR A QUARTER OF A CENTURY YOU AND THEY HAD VIOLATED ABOUT ALL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE CONSTITUTION TO WHICH YOUR ATTENTION HAD BEEN SPECIALLY DIRECTED YOU HAD DEFIED ABOUT ALL OF THE PRINCIPLES OF POLITICAL ECONOMY WHICH HAD BEEN INCONTESTABLY ESTABLISHED AND THE PEOPLE ARE ENDURING THE INEV ITABLE CONSEQUENCES BUT WITH WHAT MARVELLOUS FACILITY WE ADAPT OURSELVES TO EXISTING CONDITIONS OUR PEOPLE ARE LITERALLY REJOICING IN THE CONSOLATION WHICH THE CONVICTION THAT THE WORST IS KNOWN BRINGS EVEN TO THE HEARTS OF THOSE WHO SORROW BY THE NEWLY DEAD ONE NEED NOT BE QUITE A LEGAL ANTIQUARIAN TO HAVE STUDIED THE JUDICIAL REPORTS BACKWARDS FAR ENOUGH TO READ THE MEMBERS OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AND OURSELVES ARE BOUND BY THE SAME OFFICIAL OATHS TO SUPPORT THE CONSTITUTION AND WE CANNOT DOUBT THAT THEY GIVE CONSCIENTIOUS CONSIDERATION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL VALIDITY OF ALL THE ACTS WHICH THEY PASS I ONCE DICTATED A SEN TENCE CONVEYING THE SUBSTANCE OF THAT COMPLIMENT TO YOU BUT THE SUFFERINGS OF THAT POOR STENOGRAPHER WRITHING IN A MIRTH TO WHICH LAUGHTER AFFORDED NO SUFFI CIENT VENT WERE BEFORE MY EYES AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE FATE OF ANANIAS WAS CARE FULLY PRESERVED IN THE VAST STOREHOUSE OF MY RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTIONS I PROVED TO BE AN IRRESOLUTE LIAR AND THAT SENTENCE WILL NEVER APPEAR IN THE REPORTS  YOU MUST BE PRODIGIES OF INDUSTRY AT YOUR SESSION A YEAR AGO A MAJORITY IN BOTH HOUSES VOTED FOR FIVE HUNDRED AND SEVENTYNINE BILLS AND THEY WERE SIGNED BY YOUR PRESIDING OFFICERS DOUBTLESS QUITE A NUMBER OF THEM THEREBY BECAME LAWS YOUR MOST HOSTILE CRITICS MUST ADMIT THAT SOME OF THEM SHOW A DUE REGARD FOR PUBLIC INTERESTS THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF THE REPEALING SECTIONS TOO MUCH PRAISE CANNOT BE BESTOWED UPON THE FEW OF THESE ACTS WHICH CONTAIN NONE BUT RE PEALING SECTIONS THREE HUNDRED OF THESE ACTS ARE ALLEGED TO BE OF A GENERAL NA TURE IT IS GREATLY TO BE FEARED THAT THE COMMON PEOPLE OF THE STATE WILL FAIL TO APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE AND EFFORTS PHYSICAL AND INTELLECTUAL REQUIRED TO BRING EVERY ONE OF YOU TO AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR RELATION TO OTHER LAWS AND THEIR EFFECT UPON THE PUBLIC TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTYNINE OF THEM ARE ADMITTED TO THE LOCAL THE TIME YOU MUST HAVE SPENT IN TRAVELING TO ASCERTAIN THE LOCAL CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT TO WHICH LEGISLATIVE POWER WAS TO BE EXERCISED PASSES COMPREHENSION YOU VISITED THIRTEEN WIDELY SEPARATED COUNTIES TO ASCERTAIN THE NECESSITY FOR AND THE PROPER BOUNDARIES OF AS MANY SPECIAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS YOU VISITED MORE THAN TWENTY COUNTIES IN ORDER THAT YOU MIGHT INTELLIGENTLY ENACT THAT AS MANY STREETS AND ROADS SHOULD BE IMPROVED YOU DRAGGED YOUR WEARY FEET ALL OVER PIKE COUNTY TO LEARN THAT A MAJORITY OF THE TAX PAYERS OF THAT COUNTY DESIRED THAT MONEY WHICH HAD BEEN PAID INTO THE TREASURY BY THE SURETIES UPON THE BOND OF A DEFAULTING TREAS URER SHOULD BE REPAID TO THEM THOSE WHO WERE NOT PERMITTED TO SEE THIS EXPEDI TION HEADED BY THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR MOUNTED ON A CLYDESDALE OF HIS OWN SEX MAY AID REALIZATION BY RECALLING THE FAMILIAR PICTURE REPRESENTING DE SOTO DISCOV ERING THE MISSISSIPPI AND ADDING A SUPPLY OF BEEF ON THE HOOF UNDER THE EXPERT CARE OF THE SENATORS FROM PICKAWAY AND MEIGS THE WEARINESS OF YOUR LIMBS IS WITHIN THE COMPASS OF IMAGINATION BUT WHO COULD IMAGINE THE PAIN AND WEARI NESS ATTENDING THE INTELLECTUAL WANDERINGS WHICH LED YOU TO THE CONCLUSION THAT 1899 63 MISCELLANY64 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER MAY THE MINORITY OF THE TAX PAYERS WERE NOT ENTITLED TO INSIST THAT PUBLIC MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR PUBLIC PURPOSES   YOU CONDUCTED FOURTEEN INVESTIGATIONS WHICH RESULTED IN SATISFYING YOU THAT AS MANY FISCAL OFFICERS SHOULD BE EXCUSED FROM ACCOUNTING FOR MONEY WHICH HAD COME INTO THEIR HANDS WHAT PERSONAL SATISFACTION THERE MUST BE IN ADMINISTERING JUS TICE UNRESTRAINED BY AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO WITHOUT RESPECT TO PERSONS I ELEVEN TIMES YOU RESOLVED YOURSELVES INTO AN EXAMINING BOARD TO ASCERTAIN THAT WOMEN WHO HAD TAUGHT IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITHOUT CERTIFICATES OF QUALIFICA TION WERE IN FACT QUALIFIED AND THAT THEY SHOULD RECEIVE COMPENSATION NOTWITH STANDING THE LAW WHAT COSMOPLITANS YOU ARE IN THE WORLD OF ATTAINMENT IT FLUSHES ONES LACHRYMAL DUCTS TO CONTEMPLATE YOUR MOURNFUL PILGRIMAGE TO CLAY TOWNSHIP IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY WHERE YOU BEHELD A SIGHT WHICH SATISFIED MAJORITIES IN BOTH SENATE AND HOUSE THAT PARISH CEMETERY SHOULD BE PLACED IN CHARGE OF TRUSTEES BUT THE AVERAGE MAN IS NOT WITHOUT RESENTMENT AND THERE MAY BE MANY IN THE STATE WHO LIKE TO THINK OF YOUR SUFFERINGS ONE OF YOUR SUBJECTS HOWEVER WAS EASY I REFER TO THE BILL ENTITLED AN ACT TO PROVIDE FOR A MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT FOR CITIES HAVING A POPULATION OF NOT LESS THAN THIRTYTHREE THOUSAND AND NOT MORE THAN THIRTYFOUR THOUSAND INHABITANTS YOUR CLERK OR THE SECRETARY OF THE STATE OR SOME OTHER DILIGENT STUDENT OF THE CENSUS TABLES HAS MARKED THE BILL FOR IDENTIFICATION YOUNGSTOWN THIS BILL EVOKED BUT LITTLE MENTAL OR PHYSICIAL ACTIVITY THERE PASSED DAILY BEFORE YOU IN FORM MOST VISIBLE A TYPE OF THE INHABITANTS FOR WHOSE RESTRAINT THE STRINGENT PRO VISIONS OF THE BILL WERE INTENDED THOSE OF YOU WHO OCCUPIED SEATS IN SENATE HAD BUT TO LIFT YOUR EYES TO RECEIVE WARNING THAT SPECIAL AND EXTRAORDINARY MEASURES WOULD BE NECESSARY TO THE ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF GOOD GOVERNMENT IN THAT CITY WHATEVER IMPRESSION YOU MAY HAVE RECEIVED FROM THESE FEELING REMARKS BE ASSURED THAT YOUR KINDNESS HAS MADE ME AMBITIOUS TO BE TO YOU USEFUL RATHER THAN SYMPATHETIC YOUR SITUATION IS CRITICAL WHAT YOU NEED IS SUCH A PUBLIC UNDER STANDING OF YOUR OFFICIAL ACTS AS WILL PRESERVE RESPECT FOR BOTH YOUR CHARACTER AND YOUR GOOD SENSE DO NOT CONFIDE IN THE FRIENDSHIP OF ANY ONE WHO ADMITS EITHER THAT YOU DID NOT KNOW BETTER OR THAT YOU FAILED TO DO THE BEST YOU KNEW HOW AN ADMISSION THAT IN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTYNINE INSTANCES MORE THAN SEVENTY LEGISLATIVE VOTES WERE GIVEN UPON THE SUSPECTED KNOWLEDGE OF ONE MEMBER WOULD BE IRRETRIEVABLE DAMAGING NO LAWYER COULD SAVE YOU FROM ITS CONSEQUENCES WASTE NO MONEY ON LAWYERSYOUR SALARIES ARE SMALL AND IT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT YOU HAVE RECEIVED MORE YOU NEED WITNESSES MAKE NO MISTAKE CONCERNING THEIR QUALIFICATIONS BELIEF IN A SUPREME BEING WHO REWARDS VIRTUE AND PUNISHES FALSEHOOD MIGHT IMPAIR THEIR USEFULNESS THEIR AUDACITY SHOULD BE IN GOOD TRAINING YOU WILL NOT FIND AN ALIBI EASY YOUR JOURNALS SHOW CONCLUSIVELY THAT MEN BEARING YOUR NAMES ARE IMPLICATED IN THIS LEGISLATION YOUR APPEARANCE INDIVIDUAL AND COLLECTIVE IS SO STRIKING AND YOU ARE SO THOROUGHLY SPOTTED BY YOUR VICTIMS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT TO ESCAPE IDEN TIFICATION WILL BE DIFFICULT FURTHERMORE WITHOUT TAKING THE ADVICE OF COUNSEL YOU HAVE PROVIDED A GALLERY OF YOUR PORTRAITS THIS MUST HAVE BEEN AS INCONSIDERATE AS YOUR VOTES IF YOUR OFFENSE WERE ONLY HOMICIDE YOU COULD EASILY ESCAPE THE SEVEREST PUNISHMENT BY SHOWING A WANT OF DELIBERATION IT COULD BE EASILY ESTAB LISHED THE VOLUME OF YOUR BILLS AND LAWS SHOWS THAT YOU ACTED WITHOUT PRE MEDITATIONEVEN WITHOUT MEDITATION YOUR VICTIMS ADMIT THE PLENTITUDE OF WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO THEM BUT AS LONG AS YOU ARE ABLE TO REMAIN IN THE STATE THEY WILL DERIVE COMFORT FROM THE OBSER VATION OF YOUR GREATER SUFFERING

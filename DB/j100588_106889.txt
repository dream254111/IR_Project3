TRIANGLESF WLLOSE BASES UTERE MEASURED SVITH IEAL RODS THE ANGLES OF THE TRIANGLES WERE OB SERVED WITH A CIRCULAR INSTRUMENT OF Z FOOT RADIUS S THE DIVI SIONS OF THIS INSTRUMERLT ARE DOUBLE IN GO AND 96 DEGREESB WITH THIS INSTRUMENT THE ANGLES MAY BE OBSERVED TO A LESS ERROR THAN S ALAD THE SUM OF ALL THE ANGLES IN EVERY TRIANGLE VERY SELDOM HAVE HAD A DIFFERENCE OF 15 FROM 180 DEGREES FOR THIS REASON THE BASES MEASLLRED AT SEVERAL PLACES IN SELAND AND JUTLAND75 HAVE VERY WELL AGREED WITH THE CORRESPONDING SIDES COMPUTED THROUGH A LONG SERIES OF TRIATLGLES BEGURL FROM THE OBSERVATORY AT COPENHAGEIL I BELIEVE THAT A DISTANCE FOUND BY THOSE TRIGONOMETRICAL OPERATIOLAS IS TO LJE DEPENDECL UPON TO 2 OOOOLTH PART OF THE WHOLE I BEG LEAVE TO OBSERVE THAT THE DANISH ASTRONOMERS ALLD

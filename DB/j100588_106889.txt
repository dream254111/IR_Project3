of Astronomy al Copenhagen Read Jalauary 9s 794b ftll HE  geographical surveying of Dennlark was begun in the rear z76e Tlle foundationsofgeographical maps are the tri gonometrical operations or great trianglesf wllose bases uTere measured svith Ieal rods The angles of the triangles were ob served with a circular instrument of z foot radius S the divi sions of this instrumerlt are double in go and 96 degreesb With this instrument the angles may be observed to a less error than S alad the sum of all the angles in every triangle very seldom have had a difference of 15 from 180 degrees For this reason the bases measllred at several places in Seland and Jutland75 have very well agreed with the corresponding sides computed through a long series of triatlgles begurl from the observatory at CopenhageIl I believe that a distance found by those trigonometrical operatiolas is to lJe dependecl upon to 2 oooolth part of the whole I beg leave to observe that the Danish astronomers alld geographers for gl years hate been before hand in making use of circular instruments which now begin to be of a more general use in astrorlozzlical     ad geographical observations The royal observatory at Copenhagen has sitce the year 178zn beerz adorlaed Witll a C s  43 3Mr BUGGES Latitades and Longitubtes  circular instrument of 4 feet radius which at least at that time was the only circular instrument of that size By the trigonometrical operations the merldian ofCopenF hagen and of several other places and a perpendicular to the rneridian of the observatory are drawzl The

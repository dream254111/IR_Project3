Geological Survey of Canada has recently returned from an extraordinary expedition to the northern end of Hudson Bay The steamer Jeanie on which the party was cruising was wrecked on the evening of September 7 1910 at Wager Inlet which is almost on the Arctic Circle All the 89AMERICAN FERN JOURNAL specimens were saved and fortunately no lives were lost but the party was forced to travel 1200 miles by sea and land in order to get back to civilization The last 800 miles of this distance were covered by an overland trip from Churchill to Gimli Manitoba The botanical specimens will prove of great interest as we have no records of any botanist having previously visited the upper west coast of Hudson Bay Dr Hermann Christ of Basel Switzerland well known as a fern taxonomist has recently sold his fern herbarium to Prince Roland Bonaparte Dr Christs herbarium was probably the largest private fern herbarium ever accumulated and has been built up during a long period of years during which he has been frequently called upon to identify new collections of ferns from all over the world The herbarium of Prince Roland Bonaparte is now probably the largest public or private fern herbarium in the world containing more than 100000 specimens Dr Christ has recently completed his study of ferns with the publication of his book Die Geographie der Farnen He well deserves the title of Dean Emeritus of fern taxonomists A few members of the Fern Society are planning an informal field meet in central Connecticut for Friday Saturday and Sunday June 16th 17th and 18th Head quarters

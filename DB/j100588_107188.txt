SOME REMARKS ON COAL,I206961,IL 09J VI A THIRD SERIES OF EXPERIMENTS ON AN ARTIFICIAL SUBSTANCE WHICH POSSESSES THE PRINCIPAL CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN WITH SOME REMARKS ON COAL BY CHARLES HATCHETT ESQ F RS READ JANUARY 16 I8O6 I IN MY FORMER PAPERS UPON THIS SUBJECT SOME ACCOUNT HAS BEEN GIVEN OF THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY SULPHURIC ACID UPON TURPENTINE RESIN AND CAMPHOR AND I SHALL NOW STATE THE RESULTS OF OTHER EXPERIMENTS MADE WITH THE SAME ACID UPON A GREAT NUMBER OF THE RESINS BALSAMS GUM RESINS AND GUMS THE GREATER PART OF WHICH AFFORDED THAT MODIFICATION OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WHICH FOR THE SAKE OF DISTINCTION I HAVE IN THE PRECEDING PAPERS DENOMINATED THE THIRD VARIETY THE PROCESS WAS SIMPLE DIGESTION IN SULPHURIC ACID AFTER WHICH THE RESIDUUM WAS WELL EDULCORATED AND WAS THEN DIGESTED IN ALCOHOL THIS WAS SEPARATED BY DISTILLATION THE DRY SUBSTANCE WHICH REMAINED WAS INFUSED IN COLD DISTILLED WATER AND THE PORTION DISSOLVED WAS EXAMINED BY SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS MURIATE OF TIN ACETITE OF LEAD AND SULPHATE OF IRON MUCH SULPHUREOUS ACID CARBONIC ACID SEVERAL OF THE VEGE TABLE ACIDS PARTICULARLY BENZOIC ACID WHEN THE BALSAMS WERE EMPLOYED AND APPARENTLY WATER WERE PRODUCED DURING THE OPERATION BUT IN THIS PAPER I SHALL ONLY NOTICE TWO OF THE PRODUCTS NAMELY THE TANNING SUBSTANCE AND THE COALTL1O MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE THE SULPHURIC ACID ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED THE RESINS AND FORMED TRANSPARENT BROWN SOLUTIONS WHICH PROGRESSIVELY BECAME BLACK THE SAME EFFECT WAS PRODUCED ON MOST OF THE OTHER SUB STANCES BUT THE SOLUTIONS OF THE BALSAMS AND OF GUAIACUMN WERE AT FIRST OF A DEEP CRIMSON SLIGHTLY INCLINING TO BROWN CAOUTCHOUC AND ELASTIC BITUMEN WERE NOT DISSOLVED BUT AFTER HAVING BEEN DIGESTED FOR MORE THAN TWO MONTHS WERE ONLY SUPERFICIALLY CARBONIZED THE GUMS AND THE SACCHARINE SUBSTANCES REQUIRED MANY EVAPORATIONS AND FILTRATIONS BEFORE THE WHOLE OF THEIR CAR BONACEOUS RESIDUA COULD BE OBTAINED THESE WERE THE PRINCIPAL EFFECTS OBSERVED DURING THE EX PERIMENTS AND I HAVE STATED THEM IN THIS MANNER THAT TEDIOUS AND USELESS REPETITIONS MAY BE AVOIDED  IL TURPENTINE COMMON RESIN ELEMI TACAMAHAC MASTICH CO PAIBA COPAL CAMPHOR BENZOIN BALSAM OF TOLU BALSAM OF PERU ASA FOETIDA AND AMBER YIELDED AN ABUNDANCE OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE OIL OF TURPENTINE ALSO AFFORDED MUCH OF IT ASPHALTUM YIELDED A SMALL PORTION SOME SLIGHT TRACES OF IT WERE EVEN OBTAINED FROM GUM ARABIC AND TRAGACANTH BUT NONE WAS PRODUCED BY GUAIACUM DRAGONS BLOOD MYRRH GUM AMMO NIAC OLIBANUM GAMBOGE CAOUTCHOUC ELASTIC BITUMEN LIQUORICE AND MANNA I AM PERSUADED HOWEVER THAT MANY OF THESE WOULD HAVE AFFORDED THE TANNING SUBSTANCE HAD NOT THE DI GESTION BEEN OF TOO LONG A DURATION OLIVE OIL WAS PARTLY CONVERTED INTO THE ABOVE MENTIONEDWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 1 IX SUBSTANCE AND ALSO LINSEED OIL WAX AND ANIMAL FAT BUT THE THREE LAST APPEAR TO MERIT SOME ATTENTION LINSEED OIL THIS OIL WITH SULPHURIC ACID VERY SOON FORMED A THICK BLACKISHBROWN LIQUID WHICH AFTER BEING LONG DIGESTED IN A SANDBATH WAS STILL PARTLY SOLUBLE IN COLD WATER AND PASSED THE FILTER THIS SOLUTION PRECIPITATED GELATINE THE RESI DUUM WAS A TOUGH BLACK SUBSTANCE WHICH BECAME HARD ON EXPOSURE TO AIR A GREAT PART WAS SOLUBLE IN ALCOHOL AND FORMED A BROWN LIQUID WHICH BECAME TURBID BY THE ADDITION OF WATER WHEN THIS WAS EVAPORATED A BROWN SUBSTANCE REMAINED WHICH WAS PARTIALLY DISSOLVED BY COLD WATER AND THE SOLUTION THUS FORMED WAS RENDERED TURBID BY GELATINE THE UNDISSOLVED PORTION LEFT BY THE ALCOHOL WAS OF A BLACKISHBROWN IT WAS SOFT AND TENACIOUS AND APPEARED TO RETAIN MANY OF THE PROPERTIES OF AN INSPISSATED FAT OIL BLEACHED WAX THAT WHICH WAS EMPLOYED IN THIS EXPERIMENT WAS THE WHITE WAX OF THE SHOPS WHICH IS SOLD IN THE FORM OF SMALL ROUND CAKES IT FORMED WITH SULPHURIC ACID A THICK BLACK MAGMA AND WAS NOT ACTED UPON BY COLD DISTILLED WATER WHEN WASHED WITH IT UPON A FILTER UPON BEING DIGESTED WITH ALCOHOL IN A SANDBATH A BROWNISH SOLUTION WAS FORMED WHICH UPON COOLING BECAME VERY TURBID ANDI APPEARED AS IF FILLED WITH A WHITE FLOCCULENT SUBSTANCE THE SAME OPERATION WAS REPEATED WITH DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF ALCOHOL UNTIL THIS CEASED TO ACT THE WHOLE OF THE SOLUTIONS IN ALCOHOL WEREI I MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE THEN MIXED A LARGE QUANTITY OF DISTILLED WATER WAS ADDED AND THE ALCOHOL WAS SEPARATED BY DISTILLATION ON THE SURFACE OF THE REMAINING LIQUOR WHEN COLD A WHITE CRUST WAS FORMED WHICH BEING SEPARATED WAS FOUND TO POS SESS THE PROPERTIES OF SPERMACETI AND WEIGHED I8 GRAINS THE FILTRATED LIQUOR WAS THEN EVAPORATED TO A SMALL QUANTITY BECAME OF A PALE BROWN COLOUR AND WAS RENDERED TURBID BY SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS ANIMAL FAT THIS EXPERIMENT WAS MADE UPON THE KIDNEY FAT OF VEAL BUT I CANNOT TAKE UPON ME TO ASSERT THAT THE RESULTS WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME WITH EVERY KIND OF FAT LOO GRAINS OF IT WITH ONE OUNCE OF CONCENTRATED SULPHURIC ACID AFTER SOME TIME FORMED A BLACKISH SOFT MASS A SECOND OUNCE OF SULPHURIC ACID WAS THEN ADDED AND THE WHOLE WAS DIGESTED AND OCCASIONALLY HEATED DURING NEARLY THREE MONTHS SIX OUNCES OF DISTILLED WATER WERE POURED UPON THE BLACK PULPY MASS AND FORMED A THICK UNIFORM LIQUID WHICH AFTER DIGESTION FOR SIX OR SEVEN DAYS WAS WHEN COLD FILTRATED THE LIQUOR WHICH PASSED WAS OF A BROWN COLOUR AND UPON EVAPORATION BECAME BLACK LEAV ING A CONSIDERABLE PORTION OF A BLACKISH SUBSTANCE UPON THE FILTER WHICH WAS ADDED TO THAT WHICH HAD BEEN COLLECTED BY THE FIRST FILTRATION THE WHOLE WAS WASHED WITH COLD WATER WHICH PASSED COLOURLESS BOILING WATER WAS THEN POURED UPON THE FILTER BY WHICH A CONSIDERABLE PORTION WAS RAPIDLY DISSOLVED AND A BROWNISHBLACK SOLUTION WAS FORMED WHICH COPIOUSLY PRECIPITATED GELATINE THE RESIDUUM ON THE FILTER WAS THEN DRIED AND BEING COLWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNINT 1 LECTED WAS DIGESTED IN ALCOHOL WHICH DISSOLVED THE GREATER PART THE SOLUTION IN ALCOHOL WAS FILTRATED BUT APPARENTLY BY THE EFFECT OF AIR A CONSIDERABLE DEPOSIT WAS FORMED ON THE FILTER WHICH WAS AGAIN DISSOLVED BY ALCOHOL WATER RENDERED THE SOLUTION TURBID AND A BLACK LIGHT FLAKY SUBSTANCE WHICH WEIGHED 41 GRAINS REMAINED UPON THE FILTER THE FILTRATED LIQUOR WAS THEN EVAPORATED AND LEFT A GRAYISHBLACK SUBSTANCE WHICH WEIGHED SO GRAINS THIS LAST SUBSTANCE WAS HIGHLY INFLAMMABLE AND WHEN BURNED EMITTED A VERY PECULIAR ODOUR RESEMBLING PARTLY THAT OF FAT AND PARTLY THAT OF ASPHALTUM IT EASILY MELTED AND ALSO IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED IN COLD ALCOHOL FROM WHICH LIKE THE RESINOUS SUBSTANCES IT WAS PRECIPITATED BY WATER THE BLACK LIGHT FLAKY RESIDUUM WHICH WEIGHED 41 GRAINS WAS FOUND TO CONSIST PARTLY OF THE SUBSTANCE ABOVE MENTIONED AND PARTLY OF COAL BUT THE PROPORTION OF THIS LAST WAS NOT ASCERTAINED COAGULATED ALBUMEN AND PREPARED MUSCULAR FIBRE WERE ALSO SEPARATELY EXPOSED TO THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID IN THE MANNER ABOVE DESCRIBED BUT DID NOT AFFORD ANY SUBSTANCE BY WHICH GELATINE COULD BE PRECIPITATED COAL BEING THE ONLY PRODUCT WHICH REMAINED ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THE BODIES WHICH HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS SEEM TO BE IN SOME MEASURE DIFFERENT IN RESPECT TO THE PROGRESSIVE EFFECTS PRODUCED UPON THEM BY SULPHURIC ACID AND ALL OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BEING SIMILAR THERE APPEARS TO BE A CERTAIN PERIOD OF THE PROCESS WHEN THE PRODUCTION OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE HAS ARRIVED AT ITS MAXI MUM AFTER WHICH A GRADUAL DIMINUTION OF IT TAKES PLACE AND MDCCCVI QI 4 MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ONT A SUBSTANCE AT LENGTH TOTAL DESTRUCTION THESE EFFECTS ARE PRODUCED AT DIFFERENT PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE SUBSTANCE WHICH MAY BE THE SUBJECT OF THE EXPERIMENT AND THEREFORE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE AT PRESENT TO STATE THE UTMOST QUANTITY OF THE TANNING SUB STANCE WHICH UNDER EQUAL CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE OBTAINED FR6M EACH OF THE RESINS BALSAMS C THE TANNING SUBSTANCE APPEARS TO BE ALWAYS THE SAME WHETHER OBTAINED FROM TURPENTINE OR COMMON RESIN OR FROM THE BALSAMS OR FROM ASA FOETIDA OR CAMPHOR OR INDEED FROM ANY OF THE BODIES WHICH HAVE BEEN ENUMERATED ITS EFFECTS ON THE DIFFERENT REAGENTS ARE SIMILAR BY THE ADDITION OF A SMALL PORTION OF NITRIC ACID AND SUBSEQUENT EVAPORATION IT IS CON VERTED INTO THAT WHICH I HAVE CALLED THE FIRST VARIETY OR IF DIGESTED WITH SULPHURIC ACID IT IS SPEEDILY DESTROYED AND BECOMES MERE COAL IN THE LATTER CASE THEREFORE THE SAME AGENT WHICH AT FIRST PRODUCED IT BECOMES AT LENGTH THE CAUSE OF ITS DESTRUCTION AND THUS WE FIND THAT ALTHOUGH A TANNING SUBSTANCE MAY BE OBTAINED FROM RESINOUS AND OTHER BODIES BY MEANS OF SULPHURIC AND BY NITRIC ACID YET IN THE FORMER CASE THE PRODUCT IS VARIABLE AND IS FORMED AT OR ABOUT THE MEAN PERIOD OF THE OPERATION WHILST THE LATTER IS AN ULTIMATE AND INVARIABLE EFFECT BEYOND WHICH NO APPARENT CHANGE CAN BE PRODUCED BY ANY CONTINUATION OF THE PROCESS  III I HAVE ALREADY STATED THAT CAOUTCHOUC AND ELASTIC BITUMEN WERE ONLY SUPERFICIALLY ACTED UPON WHEN DIGESTED FOR A VERY  IN THE FORMER PAPERS UPON THIS SUBJECT I HAVE OBSERVED THAT THE TANNING SUB STANCE PRODUCED BY SULPHURIC ACID IS VERY INFERIOR IN ENERGY TO THAT WHICH IS FORMED BY NITRIC ACIDWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 115 LONG TIME IN SULPHURIC ACID AND IT IS REMARKABLE THAT THESE SUBSTANCES WHICH IN THEIR EXTERNAL CHARACTERS SO MUCH RE SEMBLE EACH OTHER SHOULD BE SIMILAR IN THEIR HABITS WHENL EXPOSED TO THE EFFECTS OF THIS ACID FOR UNLIKE THE RESINS AND MOST OF THE OTHER BODIES WHICH WERE SUBJECTED TO THE PRE CEDING EXPERIMENTS AND WHICH WERE ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVED WHEN THE ACID WAS POURED UPON THEM THESE ON THE CONTRARY REMAINED UNDISSOLVED AND ONLY BECAME PARTIA1Y CARBONIZED ON THEIR SURFACES EVEN NITRIC ACID DOES NOT SO RAPIDLY EFFECT A CHANGE IN THE ELASTIC BITUMEN AS IT DOES WHEN APPLIED TO THE OTHER BITUMINOUS SUBSTANCES 1 100OO GRAINS OF PURE SOFT ELASTIC BITUMEN WERE DIGESTED DURING THREE WEEKS IN ONE OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID DILUTED WITH AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF WATER  A TOUGH AND SLIGHTLY ELASTIC ORANGECOLOURED MASS THEN REMAINED ANOTHER OUNCE OF THE ACID NOT DILUTED WAS POURED UPON THIS MASS AND THE DIGESTION WAS CONTINUED UNTIL THE WHOLE WAS EVAPORATED THE RESIDUUM WAS TENACIOUS AND OF THE COLOUR ABOVE MENTIONED WATER PARTIALLY DIS SOLVED IT AND FORMED A DEEP YELLOW LIQUID WHICH COPIOUSLY PRECIPITATED GELATINE AND POSSESSED THE OTHER PROPERTIES OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE WHICH IS PRODUCED FROM THE RESINS C BY NITRIC ACID AN ORANGECOLOURED MASS STILL REMAINED WHICH WAS SPEEDILY DISSOLVED BY ALCOHOL AND WAS PRECIPITATED FROM IT BY A LARGE ADDITION OF WATER THIS SUBSTANCE IN MANY OF ITS PROPERTIES RESEMBLED THE RESINS BUT IN OTHERS SEEMED TO APPROACH THOSE WHICH CHA RACTERIZE THE VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER IT APPEARED TO QT 16 MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANE BE SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH HAS BEEN CURSORILY MENTIONED IN MY FIRST PAPER AND WHICH WAS OBTAINED FROM MANY OF THE PIT COALS AND BITUMENS WHEN TREATED WITH NITRIC ACID I HAVE SINCE PAID MORE ATTENTION TO THIS SUBSTANCE DURING THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS KILKENNY COAL WAS DIGESTED WITH NITRIC ACID AND PROGRES SIVELY ALTHOUGH WITH DIFFICULTY WAS CONVERTED INTO THAT VARIETY OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE WHICH HAS SO OFTEN BEEN MENTIONED SIMILAR EXPERIMENTS WERE MADE ON THE SAME SORT OF COAL FROM WALES WHICH WAS GIVEN TO ME BY MY FRIEND MR TENNANT AS WELL AS UPON A COAL SENT TO ME BY PROFESSOR WOODHOUSE WHICH WAS FROM PENSYLVANIA AND IS THERE CALLED LEIGH HIGH COAL ALL OF THESE WERE CONVERTED INTO THE TAN NING SUBSTANCE BUT THEY DID NOT YIELD ANY PRODUCT SIMILAR TO THAT OBTAINED FROM THE ELASTIC BITUMEN THE CONTRARY HOWEVER HAPPENED WHEN THE COMMON PIT COAL OR CANNEL COAL OR ASPHALTUM WERE EMPLOYED FOR WHEN THESE WERE TREATED IN THE WAY WHICH HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AND WHEN THE DIGESTION WAS NOT TOO LONG CONTINUED THEN I OB TAINED FROM LOO GRAINS OF EACH OF THE ABOVE SUBSTANCES AFTER THE SEPARATION OF THE TANNING MATTER A RESIDUUM AS FOLLOWS FROM 1OO GRAINS OF THE COMMON NEWCASTLE COAL 9 GRAINS FROM OO GRAINS OF CANNEL COAL    36 GRAINS FROM LOO GRAINS OF PURE ASPHALTUM   37 GRAINS THE SUBSTANCES THUS OBTAINED WERE VERY SIMILAR IN THEIR EXTERNAL CHARACTERS BEING OF A PALE BROWN APPROACHING TO SPANISH SNUFF COLOUR THEIR INTERNAL FRACTURE WAS DARK BROWN WITH A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF RESINOUS LUSTRE WHEN EXPOSED TO HEAT THEY DID NOT EASILY MELT BUT AS SOON AS INFLAMED THEY EMITTED A RESINOUS ODOUR MIXED WITH THAT OF FAT OIL AND PROWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 117 DUCED A VERY LIGHT COAL MUCH EXCEEDING THE BULK OF THE ORI GINAL SUBSTANCE ALCOHOL COMPLETELY DISSOLVED THEM AND IF WATER IN A LARGE PROPORTION WAS ADDED TO A SATURATED SOLUTION A PRECIPITATE WAS OBTAINED BUT AFTER EACH PRECIPITATION A PORTION ALWAYS REMAINED DISSOLVED BY THE WATER WHICH ACTED UPON THE DIF FERENT REAGENTS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO THE SOLUTIONS OF VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER THE FLAVOUR WAS ALSO BITTER AND IN SOME DEGREE AROMATIC SO THAT THE RESIDUA WHETHER OB TAINED FROM PITCOAL FROM CANNEL COAL OR FROM ASPHALTUM SEEMED TO POSSESS PROPERTIES INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN THOSE OF RESIN AND THOSE OF THE VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE SUBSTANCE THEY APPEARED HOWEVER TO BE REMOVED ONLY BY A VERY FEW DEGREES FROM THE TANNING SUBSTANCE FOR IF DIGESTED IN A SMALL QUAN TITY OF NITRIC ACID AND SUBSEQUENTLY EVAPORATED THEY WERE IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED INTO IT OR IF DIGESTED WITH SULPHURIC ACID THEY SPEEDILY BECAME REDUCED TO COAL IV IN THE 5TH SECTION OF MY SECOND PAPER SOME REMARKS WERE MADE ON THE DECOCTIONS OBTAINED FROM VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES WHICH HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY ROASTED AND ALTHOUGH EXCEPTING ONE INSTANCE THESE DECOCTIONS DID NOT AFFBRD ANY PERMANENT PRECIPITATE WITH GELATINE YET I HAVE THERE STATED THAT I DID NOT THINK IT RIGHT TO CONCLUDE THAT SIMILAR DECOCTIONS MADE UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES MIGHT NOT OCCASIONALIY POSSESS THOSE PROPERTIES WHICH CHARACTERIZE THE TANNING SUBSTANCES MOREOVER I ALSO OBSERVED IN THE SAME PAPER THAT ALL OF THOSE DECOCTIONS UPON THE ADDITION OF A SMALL PORTION OF NITRIC ACID AND SUBSEQUENT EVAPORATION BECAME CONVERTED INTO THAT VARIETY OF TANNING MATTER WHICH IS PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF NITRIC18 MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE ACID UPON CARBONACEOUS SUBSTANCES I HAVE SINCE EXTENDED THESE EXPERIMENTS AND SHALL HERE GIVE SOME ACCOUNT OF THEM 1 200OO GRAINS OF THE FRESH PEELS OF HORSE CHESNUTS WERE DI GESTED FOR ABOUT 12 HOURS IN THREE OUNCES OF DISTILLED WATER THE LIQUOR WAS OF A PALE BROWN AND FORMED A SLIGHT PALE BROWN PRECIPITATE WHEN SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS WAS ADDED TO IT 2 200 GRAINS OF THE SAME PEELS WERE MODERATELY ROASTED AND BEING AFTERWARDS DIGESTED WITH THREE OUNCES OF WATER FORMED A DARK BROWN DECOCTION WHICH WAS NOT RENDERED TURBID BY GELATINE 3 THE ABOVE MENTIONED ROASTED PEELS AFTER THE TERMINATION OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT WERE ADDED TO THE REMAINDER OF THE FILTRATED LIQUOR A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID WAS POURED UPON THE WHOLE WHICH WAS THEN DIGESTED AND EVA PORATED TO DRYNESS THE MASS WAS AFTERWARDS INFUSED IN WATER AND A DARK REDDISHBROWN LIQUID WAS OBTAINED WHICH COPIOUSLY PRECIPITATED SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS 4 2OO GRAINS OF HORSE CHESNUTS FROM WHICH THE PEELS EM PLOYED IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENTS HAD BEEN TAKEN WERE BRUISED AND WERE DIGESTED WITH THREE OUNCES OF WATER THE LIQUOR WAS TURBID AND OF A PALE RED COLOUR IT WAS FILTRATED AND SOME SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS WAS ADDED BUT WITHOUT ANY EFFECTWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 119 5 200 GRAINS OF THE SAME HORSE CHESNUTS WERE MODERATELY ROASTED AND BEING TREATED AS ABOVE DESCRIBED WITH WATER YIELDED A DARK BROWN DECOCTION WHICH WAS NOT RENDERED TURBID BY ISINGLASS 6 THE HORSE CHESNUTS WHICH HAD BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE PRE CEDING EXPERIMENT WITH THE REMAINING LIQUOR WERE DIGESTED WITH A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID UNTIL THE WHOLE WAS BECOME DRY WATER WAS THEN POURED UPON IT WAS DIGESTED AND A DARK BROWN LIQUID WAS FORMED WHICH AFFORDED A CONSI DERABLE PRECIPITATE BY THE ADDITION OF SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS IT APPEARSTHAT THE SMALL PORTION OF TANNIN WHICH THE HORSE CHESNUT PEELS ORIGINALLY CONTAINED WAS DESTROYED BY THE PROCESS OF ROASTING THAT THE BROWN DECOCTION SUBSEQUENTLY OBTAINED FROM THE ROASTED PEELS AND FROM THE HORSE CHESNUTS DID NOT ACT UPON GELATINE BUT THAT THESE WERE SPEEDILY CONVERTED INTO THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUB STANCE BY THE ADDITION OF A SMALL PORTION OF NITRIC ACID AND SUB SEQUENT EVAPORATION THE FIRST PREPARATIONS OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE FORMER PAPERS WERE MADE FROM COAL OF DIFFERENT DESCRIPTIONS DIGESTED WITH NITRIC ACID AND AS SIMILAR PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN OBTAINED BY THE SAME ACID FROM VARIOUS DECOCTIONS OF ROASTED VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES THERE CANNOT BE ANY DOUBT THAT VEGETABLE BODIES WHEN ROASTED YIELD SOLUTIONS BY DIGESTION IN WATER WHICH ESSENTIALLY CONSIST OF CARBON APPROACHING TO THE STATE OF COAL ALTHOUGH NOT ABSO LUTELY CONVERTED INTO IT FOR IF SO ALL SOLUBILITY IN WATER WOULD CEASE BUT COAL IS APPARENTLY NOTHING MORE THAN CARBON OXIDIZED12O MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE TO A CERTAIN DEGREE AND MAY BE FORMED BY THE HUMID AS WELL AS BY THE DRY WAY EXAMPLES HAVE BEEN ALREADY STATED RESPECTING OPERATIONS IN WHICH SULPHURIC ACID HAS PRODUCED THIS EFFECT BUT THE SAME LIKEWISE APPEARS TO BE PRODUCED WITH SOME MODIFICA TIONS WHENEVER VEGETABLE MATTER UNDERGOES THE PUTREFACTIVE PROCESS FOR WHEN THIS TAKES PLACE AS IN DUNGHILLS C A LARGE PROPORTION OF THE CARBON OF THE ORIGINAL VEGETABLE SUB STANCES APPEARS TO BE COMBINED WITH OXYGEN SUFFICIENT TO COMMUNICATE TO IT MANY OF THE PROPERTIES OF COAL WHILST THE COMPOUND NEVERTHELESS IS CAPABLE OF BEING DISSOLVED BY WATER WITH THE MOST PERFECT FACILITY IT MUST NOT HOWEVER BE UNDERSTOOD THAT BY THIS PROCESS ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES ARE SEPARATED SO THAT ONLY THE CARBON REMAINS COMBINED WITH OXYGEN BUT MERELY THAT THE OTHER PRINCIPLES ARE SO FAR DIMINISHED THAT THESE NAMELY CARBON AND OXYGEN PREDOMINATE IN A STATE APPROACHING TO COAL ALTHOUGH SOLUBLE IN WATER SUCH SOLUTIONS I HAVE EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE ARE NEARLY SIMILAR TO THOSE AFFORDED BY VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES WHICH HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY ROASTED AND ALTHOUGH I HAVE EXAMINED BUT A FEW OF THEM YET I SHALL RELATE SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE LATELY MADE ON THE PEELS OF WALNUTS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT WHEN THESE ARE KEPT IN SMALL HEAPS FOR A SHORT TIME THEY BECOME SOFT AND BREAK DOWN INTO A BLACK MASS WHICH AFFORDS A BROWNISHBLACK LIQUOR ON THESE I THEREFORE MADE THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS ABOUT ONE OUNCE OF WALNUT PEELS WHICH WERE BECOME SOFT AND BLACK WAS DIGESTED IN WATER A DARK BROWN LIQUOR WAS THUS FORMED AND BEING FILTRATEDWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 121 WAS EXAMINED BY A SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS BUT NOT ANY APPARENT EFFECT WAS PRODUCED 2 ON AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF THE WALNUT PEELS IN THE SAME SOFT BLACK STATE A SMALL PORTION OF NITRIC ACID WAS POURED AND AFTER BEING DIGESTED FOR ABOUT FIVE HOURS THE WHOLE WAS EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS THE RESIDUUM WAS OF A BROWNISH ORANGE COLOUR AND YIELDED A SIMILAR COLOURED SOLUTION TO WATER WHEN DIGESTED WITH IT THIS WAS FILTRATED AND UPON THE ADDITION OF SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS BECAME TURBID AND DEPO SITED A TOUGH PRECIPITATE WHICH WAS NOT DISSOLVED BY BOILING WATER 3 ANOTHER PORTION OF THE WALNUT PEELS WAS MODERATELY ROASTED AND WAS THEN DIGESTED IN WATER THE BROWN SOLUTION WAS FIL TRATED AND FORMED A SLIGHT PRECIPITATE WITH GELATINE 4 ON THE RESIDUUM OF THE LAST EXPERIMENT A SMALL QUANTITY OF NITRIC ACID WAS POURED SOME WATER WAS THEN ADDED THE WHOLE WAS DIGESTED DURING ABOUT FIVE HOURS AND UNTIL IT BECAME PERFECTLY DRY WATER FORMED WITH THIS A BROWN LIQUOR WHICH YIELDED A VERY ABUNDANT PRECIPITATE BY THE ADDITION OF DISSOLVED ISINGLASS UPON THESE EXPERIMENTS WE MAY REMARK THAT THE SOLUTION IN THE FIRST INSTANCE CONTAINED CARBON IN A STATE APPROACHING TO COAL FOR WHEN TREATED WITH NITRIC ACID IN THE SECOND EXPE RIMENT A PORTION ALTHOUGH SMALL WAS PRODUCED OF THE SAME TANNING SUBSTANCE WHICH IS FORMED FROM THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF COAL BY NITRIC ACID MDCCCVI R122 MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE THE THIRD EXPERIMENT APPEARS TO SHEW THAT A SMALL QUAN TITY OF A SUBSTANCE APPROACHING TO TANNIN WAS PRODUCED BY THE SIMPLE PROCESS OF ROASTING AND THE FOURTH EXPERIMENT CORROBORATES THOSE ALREADY DESCRIBED IN WHICH THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING MATTER WAS COPIOUSLY PRODUCED WHENEVER ROASTED VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES WERE TREATED WITH NITRIC ACID IN RESPECT TO VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH CONTAIN TANNIN I SHALL HERE RELATE A FEW OTHER EXPERIMENTS IT HAS BEEN REMARKED IN MY SECOND PAPER P 288 THAT THE TANNIN OF GALLS WAS IMMEDIATELY DESTROYED BY NITRIC ACID SINCE THAT TIME I HAVE MADE THE FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL EX PERIMENTS 1 IOO GRAINS OF GALLS REDUCED TO POWDER WERE INFUSED WITH FOUR OUNCES OF WATER AND PART OF THE INFUSION UPON THE ADDI TION OF SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS AFFORDED AS USUAL A COPIOUS PRECIPITATE OF A BROWNISHWHITE COLOUR A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID WAS ADDED TO ONE OUNCE OF THE ABOVE INFUSION WHICH THEN WAS NOT IN ANY MANNER AFFECTED BY THE DISSOLVED ISINGLASS 2 OO GRAINS OF THE SAME GALLS WERE SLIGHTLY ROASTED AND BEING DIGESTED WITH FOUR OUNCES OF WATER FORMED A BROWN LIQUOR WHICH WAS FILTRATED SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS WAS THEN ADDED TO A PART OF THE ABOVE LIQUOR AND PRODUCED A PRECIPITATE NOT VERY UNLIKE THE FORMER BUT MUCH LESS IN QUANTITY AFTER THIS A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID WAS ADDED TO ONE OUNCE OF THE SAME LIQUOR AND SOME DISSOLVED ISINGLASSWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OFTANNIN X WAS SUBSEQUENTLY POURED INTO IT BY WHICH IT WAS RENDERED TURBID AND A SMALL PORTION OF A DARK BROWN PRECIPITATE WAS PRODUCED RESEMBLING THAT WHICH IS COMMONLY AFFORDED BY THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE THE REMAINDER OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED LIQUOR WITH THE RESIDUUM OF THE ROASTED GALLS WERE DIGESTED WITH A QUARTER OF AN OUNCE OF NITRIC ACID UNTIL THE WHOLE HAD BECOME DRY WATER WAS THEN POURED UPON IT AND FORMED A DARK BROWN SOLUTION WHICH YIELDED A COPIOUS BROWN PRECIPITATE BY THE ADDITION OF DISSOLVED ISINGLASS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS ON GALLS IT APPEARS THAT THE NATURAL TANNIN CONTAINED IN THEM IS DESTROYED BY NITRIC ACID THAT THE TANNIN IS ALSO DIMINISHED AND I MAY ADD IS ULTIMATELY DESTROYED BY THE PROCESS OF ROASTING THAT WHEN GALLS HAVE NOT BEEN SO FAR ROASTED AS TO DESTROY THE WHOLE OF THE TANNIN THEN THE REMAINDER OF THIS SEEMS TO BE DESTROYED BY THE AD DITION OF NITRIC ACID WHILST AT THE SAME TIME A SMALL PORTION OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE IS PRODUCED AND THAT THIS LAST IS ALWAYS PLENTIFULLY AFFORDED BY ROASTED GALLS WHEN DIGESTED WITH NITRIC ACID SIMILAR TO OTHER VEGETABLE BODIES WHEN THUS TREATED THESE REMARKS ARE ALSO PARTLY CONFIRMED BY THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS UPON OAK BARK A 2OO GRAINS OF OAK BARK REDUCED INTO VERY SMALL FRAGMENTS WERE INFUSED IN ABOUT FOUR OUNCES OF WATER AFTER WHICH THE INFUSION WAS EXAMINED BY DISSOLVED ISINGLASS AND YIELDED A CONSIDERABLE PRECIPITATE R224 MRI HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE 2 0OO GRAINS OF THE SAME SORT OF BARK WERE SLIGHTLY ROASTED AND AFTERWARDS DIGESTED IN WATER A MUCH DARKER COLOURED LIQUOR WAS OBTAINED THAN IN THE FORMER CASE BUT ALTHOUGH IT AFFORDED PRECIPITATES BY THE ADDITION OF MURIATE OF TIN ACETITE OF LEAD AND SULPHATE OF IRON YET NOT THE SMALLEST EFFECT WRAS PRODUCED BY SOLUTION OF ISINGLASS 3 THE RESIDUUM WITH THE REMAINING PART OF THE ABOVE MEN TIONED LIQUOR WAS THEN DIGESTED WITH A SMALL PORTION OF NITRIC ACID THIS WAS COMPLETELY EVAPORATED AND A BROWN SOLUTION WAS FORMED BY WATER WHICH ABUNDANTLY PRECIPITATED GELATINE 4 ONE OUNCE OF OAK BARK REDUCED INTO VERY SMALL FRAGMENTS WAS REPEATEDLY DIGESTED IN DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF WATER UNTIL THE WHOLE OF ITS TANNIN WAS EXTRACTED THE RESIDUUM OR EX HAUSTED BARK AS IT IS CALLED BY THE TANNERS WAS DRIED AND WAS AFTERWARDS MODERATELY ROASTED IT WAS THEN MOISTENED WITH DILUTED NITRIC ACID WHICH WAS EVAPORATED IN A HEAT NOT MUCH EXCEEDING 3OO UNTIL THE BARK WAS BECOME PERFECTLY DRY THIS WAS DIGESTED IN WATER AND SPEEDILY FORMED A YELLOWISHBROWN LIQUORWHICH ABUNDANTLY PRECIPITATED GELATINE 5 THE BARK WHICH AFTER BEING EXHAUSTED OF ITS NATURAL TANNIN HAD THUS AFFORDED THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WAS REPEAT EDLY TREATED WITH WATER UNTIL THE WHOLE OF THIS LAST WAS EX TRACTED THE BARK WAS THEN AGAIN SLIGHTLY ROASTED WAS AGAINWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 125 MOISTENED WITH NITRIC ACID AND WAS GENTLY HEATED AND DRIED AS BEFORE WATER BEING POURED ON IT AND DIGESTED FORMED A BROWN SOLUTION WHICH COPIOUSLY PRECIPITATED GELATINE 6 THE WHOLE OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WAS EXTRACTED BY DIFFERENT PORTIONS OF WATER AND THE REMAINDER OF THE BARK THUS EXHAUSTED WAS AGAIN TREATED IN THE MANNER ABOVE DE SCRIBED AND AGAIN AFFORDED A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE SO THAT THESE PROCESSES EVIDENTLY MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONTINUED UNTIL THE WHOLE OF THE BARK HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO IT THIS MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED IF IN THE FIRST INSTANCE THE EXHAUSTED BARK HAD BEEN CONVERTED INTO CHAR COAL AND DIGESTED IN NITRIC ACID AS DESCRIBED IN MY FIRST PAPER BUT THEN THE EFFECTS WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE SLOWLY PRODUCED AND MUCH MORE NITRIC ACID WOULD HAVE BEEL CONSUMED I AM NOW THEREFORE FULLY CONVINCED NOT ONLY BY THE RESULTS OF THE EXPERIMENTS RELATED IN THIS PAPER BUT ALSO BY MANY OTHERS WHICH IT WOULD HAVE BEEN SUPERFLUOUS TO HAVE STATED THAT THE MOST SPEEDY AND MOST ECONOMICAL OF ALL THE PROCESSES WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED IS THAT OF TREATING ROASTED VEGETABLE SUB STANCES IN THE WAY WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED AND CONSIDERING THAT ALL REFUSE VEGETABLE MATTER MAY BE THUS CONVERTED INTO A TANNING SUBSTANCE BY MEANS THE MOST SIMPLE AND WITHOUT ANY EXPENSIVE APPARATUS I CANNOT HELP ENTERTAINING MUCH HOPE THAT EVENTUALLY THIS DISCOVERY WILL BE PRODUCTIVE OF SOME REAL PUBLIC ADVANTAGEMR HATCHIETTS EXPERIMZIENTS ON A SUBSTANCE V IN MY FIRST PAPER I LIAVE REMARKED THAT I SUSPECTED THE TANNIN OF THE PEAT MOORS TO 11AVE BEEN PRODUCED DURING THE IMPERFECT CARBONIZATION OF THE ORIGINAL VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES WHETHER THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE OR WHETHER THE TANNIN HAS AT TIMES BEEN AFFORDED BY HEATH AND OTHER VEGETABLES GROWING UPON OR NEAR THE PEAT STILL APPEARS TO ME TO BE UNCERTAIN BUT WHATEVER MAY BE THE ORIGIN I NEVER HAVE YET BEEN ABLE TO DETECT ANY TANNING SUBSTANCE IN PEAT ALTHOUGH I HAVE EXA MINED A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF VARIETIES SOME FROM BERK SHIRE AND MANY FROM LANCASHIRE WHICH WVERE OBLIGINGLY SENT TO ME FOR THIS PURPOSE BY MY FRIEND JOHN WALKER ESQ F IT S MR JAMESON HAS ALSO MADE THE SAME OBSERVATION SO THAT THERE CANNOT BE ANY DOUBT WHATEVER THE ORIGIN OF THE TANNING MATTER MAY HAVE BEEN THAT IT HAS SPEEDILY BEENI EXTRACTED AND DRAINED FROM THE SUBSTANCES WHICH AT FIRST CONTAINED IT THIS EFFECT IS A NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE GREAT FACILITY WITH WHICH TANNIN IS DISSOLVED BY WATER AND EXTENDS EVEN TO THE MOST SOLID VEGETABLE BODIES I SHALL HERE GIVE AN EXAMPLE IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1799 DR CORREA DE SERRA HAS GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF A SUBMARINE FOREST AT SUTTON ON THE COAST OF LINCOLNSHIRE WHERE SUBMERGED VEGETABLES ARE FOUND IN GREAT ABUNDANCE INCLUDING TREES OF DIFFIERENT DESCRIP TIONS ESPECIALLY BIRCH FIR AND OAK AT THE TIME WHEN I WAS ENGAGED IN THOSE EXPERIMENTS ON THE BOVEY COAL AND OTHER SUBSTANCES OF A SIMILAR NATURE WHICH HAVE BEEN PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS LOR 1804 SIR JOSEPH BANKS  AN OUTLINE OF THE MINERALOGV OF THE SHETLAND ISLANDS C SVO EDITION P 1740 I126WHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 127 HAD THE GOODNESS TO SEND ME A PIECE OF THE OAK WHICH WAS PERFECT IN ALL OF ITS VEGETABLE CHARACTERS AND DID NOT APPEAR TO HAVE SUFFERED ANY CHANGE EXCEPTING THAT IT WAS HARDER AND OF A DARKER COLOUR THAN RECENT OAK WOOD FROM SOME EXPE RIMENTS WHICH I THEN MADE I FOUND THAT AFTER INCINERATION IT AFFORDED POTASH SIMILAR TO THE RECENT WOOD AND CONTRARY TO SUBSTANCES LIKE THE BOVEY COAL WHICH RETAIN THE VEGETABLE EXTERNAL CHARACTERS ALTHOUGH IMPERFECTLY CONVERTED INTO COAL  IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPERIMENTS ON TANNIN I REDUCED ABOUT AN OUNCE OF THIS SUBMERGED OAK INTO SHAVINGS AND DIGESTED THEM IN WATER A BROWN DECOCTION WAS FORMED WHICH WITH MURIATE OF TIN AFFORDED A PALE BROWN PRECIPITATE WITH ACETITE OF LEAD A PRECIPITATE OF A DEEPER BROWN WITH SULPHATE OF IRON A COPIOUS BROWNISHBLACK PRECIPITATE  BUT WITH SOLUTION OF ISIN GLASS NOT ANY EFFECT WAS PRODUCED THE TANNIN OF THIS OAK WOOD HAD THEREFORE EITHER BEEN SEPARATED BY SOLUTION OR HAD BEEN DECOMPOSED SO THAT THE ONLY SUBSTANCE WHICH REMAINED CAPABLE OF BEING DISSOLVED BY WATER WAS THE EXTRACTIVE MATTER THIS LAST IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS MOST PROBABLY THE ORIGINAL EXTRACTIVE MATTER OF THE OAK BUT IN SOME OTHER INSTANCES SUCH FOR EXAMPLE AS THAT WHICH WAS FOUND IN THE ALDER LEAVES CONTAINED IN THE ICELAND SCHISTUST I AM MUCH INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT AN EXTRACTIVE SUBSTANCE OF SECONDARY FORMATION IF I MAY BE PERMITTED TO EMPLOY SUCH A TERM IS PRODUCED DURING THE PROCESS OF CAR BONIZATION IF A SUBSTANCE THEREFORE SO COMPACT AND SOLID AS OAK TIMBER CAN BY LONG SUBMERSION BE DEPRIVED OF ITS TANNIN IT NATURALLY FOLLOWS THAT THE SAME EFFECT MUST BE MORE SPEEDILY PRODUCED BY THE ACTION OF WATER ON THE SMALLER VEGETABLE  PHIL TRANS FOR 1804 P 399 T IBID P 391128 MR HATCHETT EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE BODIES WHICH PRESENT AN EXTENSIVE SURFACE AND ALSO ON POROUS AND BIBULOUS SUBSTANCES SUCH AS PEAT BUT ALTHOUGH PEAT AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED DOES NOT CONTAIN ANY TANNIN YET THE IMPERFECT CARBONIZATION WHICH IT HAS UNDERGONE RENDERS IT LIKE THE ROASTED LIGNEOUS BODIES PECULIARLY SUSCEPTIBLE OF BEING CONVERTED INTO THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WHEN EXPOSED TO THE ACTION OF NITRIC ACID IT WOULD BE USELESS TO ENTER INTO A DETAIL OF THE DIFFERENT EX PERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE UPON IT AS THEY WERE SIMILAR TO THOSE ALREADY RELATED AND I SHALL THEREFORE ONLY HERE STATE THAT WHEN SEVEN OUNCES OF WELL DRIED PEAT HAD BEEN TWICE MOISTENED AND DIGESTED WITH DILUTED NITRIC ACID TO THE AMOUNT OF RATHER MORE THAN TWO OUNCES AND SUBSEQUENTLY DRIED I OBTAINED BY WATER A SOLUTION OF THE ARTIFICIAL TANNING SUBSTANCE WLHICH WHEN EVAPORATED TO DRYNESS WEIGHED TWO OUNCES I AM CONVINCED THAT MUCH MORE MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE RESIDUUM OF THE PEAT HAD I THOUGHT PROPER TO HAVE REPEATED THE OPERATION AND I AM ALSO CERTAIN THAT LESS NITRIC ACID XWOULD HAVE BEEN SUFFICIENT HAD THE PROCESS BEEN CON DUCTED IN CLOSE VESSELS AND WITH OTHER ECONOMICAL PRECAUTIONS WHICH AT THAT TIME WERE FOR THE SAKE OF EXPEDITION A CON VENIENCE OMITTED VI IT HAS BEEN GENERALLY STATED EVEN BY MODERN CHEMISTS THAT THE ACIDS ACT BUT LITTLE IF AT ALL UPON RESINOUS

ACID ACTS UPON RESIN GLUTEN AND SOME OTHER SUBSTANCES SO THAT IT MAY JUSTLY BE REGARDED AS A VALUABLE AGENT IN THE CHEMICAL ANALYSIS OF VEGETABLE BODIES IN THIS POINT OF VIEW IT IS AS A SOLVENT TO BE THE MORE HIGHLY APPRECIATED BECAUSE IT APPEARS TO DISSOLVE THE RESINS C WITHOUT AFFECTING THEIR RESPECTIVE QUALITIES AND THUS BY PROPER PRECIPITANTS THESE SUBSTANCES MAY BE SEPARATED FROM IT PURE AND UNALTERED I AM INDUCED THEREFORE TO CONSIDER ACETIC ACID TO BE THE TRUE ACID SOLVENT OF THE RESINOUS SUBSTANCES AS IT DISSOLVES THEM SPEEDILY WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY APPARENT SUBSEQUENT CHANGE IN THEIR NATURAL PROPERTIES SULPHURIC ACID ALSO ALMOST IMMEDIATELY DISSOLVES THE RESINS BALSAMS C AND FORMS TRANSPARENT BROWN OR SOMETIMES CRIMSON SOLUTIONS THE LATTER COLOUR BEING MOST COMMONLY CHARACTERISTIC OF THE BALSAMS THESE SOLUTIONS HOWEVER ARE DIFFIRENT FROM THOSE MADE IN THE ACETIC ACID BY NOT BEING PERMANENT FOR FROM THE MOMENT WHEN THE SOLUTION IS COMPLETED PROGRESSIVE ALTERATIONS APPEAR TO BE PRODUCED IN THE BODY WHICH IS DISSOLVED THUS TURPEN TINE IS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY CONVERTED INTO RESIN THEN INTO THE THIRD VARIETY OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE AND LASTLY INLTO COAL WITHOUT BEING UNDER THE NECESSIY OF ADDUCING OTHER EX AMPLES WE MAY THEREFORE STATE SALPHURIC ACID TO BE A SOLVENT OF THE RESINOUS SUBSTANCES BUT VWHICH CONTINUES AFTERWARDS TO ACT ONI THEIR PRINCIPLES SO AS TO DECOMPOSE THEM COAL BEING THE ULTIMATE PRODUCT NITRIC ACID AS I HAVE SHEWN IN THE COURSE OF THESE PAPERS MNDCCCVO SSO MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE AND LIKEWISE ON SOME FORMER OCCASIONS DISSOLVES THE RESINS BUT THE PROGRESS OF ITS EFFECTS SEEMS TO BE CONVERSELY THAT OF SULPHURIC ACID IN THE LATTER CASE SOLUTION PRECEDES DECOMPO SITION BUT WHEN NITRIC ACID IS EMPLOYED DECOMPOSITION TO A CERTAIN DEGREE PRECEDES SOLUTION FOR IT AT FIRST CONVERTS THE RESINS INTO A PALE ORANGECOLOURED BRITTLE POROUS SUBSTANCE THEN INTO A PRODUCT WHICH APPARENTLY POSSESSES THE INTERME DIATE CHARACTERS OF VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER AND OF RESIN AND LASTLY THIS IS CONVERTED INTO THE FIRST VARIETY OF THE TAN NING SUBSTANCE BEYOND WHICH I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO EFFECT ANY CHANGE AS COAL THEREFORE APPEARS TO BE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT PRODUCED BY SULPHURIC ACID UPON THE RESINOUS BODIES SO DOES THE FIRST VARIETY OF THE TANNING SUBSTANCE SEEM TO BE THE TERMINATING PRODUCT AFFORDED BY THE SAME WHEN ACTED UPON BY NITRIC ACID THIS EFFECT OF NITRIC ACID HAS BEEN ALREADY AMPLY DISCUSSED NEITHER DOES IT APPEAR NECESSARY THAT I SHOULD HERE REPEAT THE REMARKS WHICH HAVE BEEN MADE ON SOME OF THE SIMULTANEOUS PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE VEGETABLE ACIDS BUT AMONGST THE EFFECTS PRODUCED BY SULPHURIC ACID THE COAL WHICH IS FORMED SEEMS TO MERIT SOME ATTENTION  VII AFTER THE TANNING SUBSTANCE AND THE OTHER PRODUCTS HAD BEEN OBTAINED FROM THE RESINS BALSAMS C WHICH HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PAPER THE FOLLOWING PRO PORTIONS OF COAL REMAINED  THE WEIGHT OF THE COAL OBTAINED FROM EACH OF THE ABOVE

WERE ONLY SUPERFICIALLY CARBONIZED BY THE SUL PHURIC ACID SO THAT THE PROPORTION OF COAL AS ABOVE STATED IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT WHICH IN REALITY MIGHT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED FROM THEM S 2MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE EQUAL QUANTITIES OF THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE EXPOSED TO SIMPLE DISTILLATION FOR AS I HAVE STATED IN MY FIRST PAPER OO GRAINS OF COMMON RESIN BY THE HUMID PROCESS AFFORDED 43 OF COAL WHICH AFTER A RED HEAT STILL WEIGHED 3O GRAINS BUT THE SAME QUANTITY OF RESIN BY DISTILLATION ONLY YIELDED  OF A GRAIN OF COAL LOO GRAINS OF MASTICH BY THE FIRST METHOD AFFORDED 66 GRAINS OF COAL OO GRAINS OF THE SAME MASTICH ONLY GAVE 4 GRAINS OF COAL WHEN SIMPLY DISTILLED AND 1OO GRAINS OF AMBER WHEN TREATED WITH SULPHURIC ACID YIELDED 56 GRAINS OF COAL BUT FROM 1OO GRAINS OF THE SAME AMBER WHEN DISTILLED ONLY J GRAINS COULD BE OBTAINED MANY OTHER EXAMPLES MIGHT BE ADDUCED BUT THESE APPEAR TO BE SUFFICIENT AND I MUST HERE OBSERVE THAT THE CASE IS VERY DIFFERENT IN RESPECT TO THE GUMS FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PROPORTIONS OF COAL OBTAINED FROM THEM BY THE HUMID AND DRY WAYS IS NOT VERY CONSIDERABLE ALTHOUGH IT IS ALWAYS THE GREATEST IN THE FORMER PROCESS WHEN CONDUCTED WITH PRECAUTION MOREOVER IT IS TO BE REMARKED THAT IN EITHER PROCESS VARIATIONS IN THE QUANTITY OF COAL ARE PRODUCED BY DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE BY THE FIGURE AND SIZE OF THE VESSELS AND MANY OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IT IS NOT ONLY IN THE PROPORTION THAT THERE IS SO GREAT A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COAL OBTAINED FROM THE RESINOUS SUB STANCES BY THE HUMID WAY OR BY FIRE FOR THE QUALITY IS ALSO MOST COMMONLY DIFFERENT AND THIS NOT ONLY APPLIES TO THE RESINS BUT ALSO TO LIGNEOUS MATTERWHIZCH POSSESSES TIE CHARACTERSTIC PROPERTOES OF TANIN X13 THE COAL OBTAINED BY THE HUMID PROCESS FROM MANY OF THE RESINS WAS SHINING HARD AND OCCASIONALLY IRIDESCENT FEW OF THE COALS OBTAINED FROM THE SAME BODIES BY FIRE HAD ANY OF THESE PROPERTIES THE COMBUSTION OF THE FORMER WAS SLOW IN THE MANNER OF SOME OF THE MINERAL COALS WHILST ON THE CON TRARY THE LATTER WERE SPEEDILY CONSUMED LIKE CHARCOAL THIS DIFFERENCE I WAS AT FIRST INCLINED TO ATTRIBUTE TO A SMALL PORTION OF THE ACID WHICH MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY SEPARATED AND I THEREFORE PURPOSELY MADE SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH CONVINCED ME THAT THIS WAS NOT THE CASE HAVING REMARKED THIS DIFFERENCE IN THE COALS AFFORDED BY THE RESINS I WAS DESIROUS TO MAKE SOME COMPARATIVE EXPERI MENTS ON WOOD AND FOR THIS PURPOSE I SELECTED OAK I ON 480 GRAINS OF OAK SAWDUST I POURED TWO OUNCES OF SUL PHURIC ACID DILUTED WITH SIX OUNCES OF WATER AND PLACED THE MATRASS ON A SANDBATH WHERE IT REMAINED FROM THE BEGIN NING OF LAST JUNE TO THE END OF SEPTEMBER DURING THIS TIME THE SANDBATH HAD VERY SELDOM BEEN HEATED BUT THE VESSEL WAS OCCASIONALLY SHAKEN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD ABOVE MENTIONED SIX OUNCES OF BOILING WATER WERE ADDED AND THE WHOLE BEING POURED UPON A FILTER WAS REPEATEDLY WASHED AND WAS AFTERWARDS DRIED ON A SANDBATH IN A HEAT NOT MUCH EXCEEDING 3OO THE SAWDUST APPEARED TO BE REDUCED TO A GRANULATED COAL PARTLY PULVERULENT AND PARTLY CLOTTED THE WHOLE WEIGHED 21Q GRAINS 105 GRAINS OF THIS COAL WERE PUT INTO A PLATINA CRUCIBLE AND WERE EXPOSED TO A RED HEAT UNDER A MUFFLE AT THE SAME134 MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE TIME AN EQUAL QUANTITY OF CHARCOAL MADE FROM THE SAME OAK SAWDUST WAS PLACED IN ANOTHER VESSEL BY THE SIDE OF THE FORMER THE CHARCOAL WAS SPEEDILY CONSUMED AND LEFT SOME BROWNISHWHITE ASHES WHICH AS USUAL AFFORDED ALKALI WITH A TRACE OF A SULPHATE WHICH WAS PROBABLY SULPHATE OF POTASH ON THE CONTRARY THE COAL FORMED BY THE HUMID WAY BURNED WITHOUT FLAME SIMILAR TO THE KILKENNY COAL AND OTHERS WHICH DO NOT CONTAIN BITUMEN IT WAS VERY SLOWLY CONSUMED LIKE THE MINERAL COALS ABOVE MENTIONED AND LEFT SOME PALE RED ASHES WHICH WEIGHED 2 GRAINS THESE ASHES DID NOT YIELD THE SMALLEST VESTIGE OF ALKALI AND THE ONLY SALINE SUBSTANCE WHICH COULD BE OBTAINED WAS A VERY SMALL PORTION OF SULPHATE OF POTASH WHICH DID NOT AMOUNT TO MORE THAN  OF A GRAIN AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT HAD THE COAL BEEN MORE COPIOUSLY WASHED EVEN THIS SMALL PORTION OF THE NEUTRAL SALT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN OBTAINED 2 AT THE TIME WHEN THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENT WAS BEGAN I ALSO PUT 480 GRAINS OF THE OAK SAWDUST INTO ANOTHER INATRASS AND HAVING ADDED FOUR OUNCES OF COMMON MURIATIC ACID THE WHOLE WAS SUFFERED TO REMAIN DURING THE PERIOD WHICH HAS BEEN MENTIONED AT THE END OF THE FOUR MONTHS THE REMAINDER OF THE ACID WAS FOR THE GREATER PART DRIVEN OFF BY HEAT NOT EXCEEDING 30O THE SAWDUST THEN HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A BROWNISH BLACK MASS ON WHICH ABOUT A PINT OF BOILING DISTILLED WATER WAS POURED THE WHOLE WAS DECANTED INTO A FILTER WAS RE PEATEDLY WASHED AND WAS AFTERWARDS DRIED WITHOUT HEAT THE SAWDUST THEN APPEARED AS I HAVE OBSERVED BROWNISHWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN I3 BLACK AND WAS PULVERULENT IT BURNED WITH SOME FLAME EMITTED STILL A SLIGHT VEGETABLE ODOUR AND WAS REDUCED TO ASHES MUCH SOONER THAN THE COAL FORMED BY SULPHURIC ACID BUT NOT SO SPEEDILY AS THE OAK CHARCOAL THE ASHES HAD AN OCHRACEOUS APPEARANCE AND WERE ALMOST DEVOID OF ANY SALINE SUBSTANCE EXCEPTING A VERY SLIGHT TRACE OF MURIATE OF POTASH THESE TWO EXPERIMENTS THEREFORE PROVE IST THAT WOOD MAY BY SULPHURIC ACID BE CONVERTED INTO A COAL WHICH IN ITS PROPERTIES IS VERY DIFFERENT FROM CHARCOAL ALTHOUGH PREPARED FROM THE SAME SORT OF WOOD AND THAT THE COAL THUS FORMED BY THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID RESEMBLES BY ITS MODE OF BURNING AND BY NOT AFFORDING ANY ALKALI WHEN REDUCED TO ASHES THOSE MINERAL COALS WHICH ARE DEVOID OF BITUMEN 2DLY THAT WOOD MAY ALSO BE CONVERTED INTO A SORT OF COAL BY MURIATIC ACID BUT IN THIS CASE SOME OF THE VEGETABLE CHA RACTERS REMAIN ALTHOUGH LIKE THE FORMER NOT ANY ALKALI CALL BE OBTAINED FROM THE ASHES  VIII FOUR DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN PROPOSED RESPECTING THAT DIFFICULT PROBLEM IN THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MINERALS THE ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF COAL THE FIRST IS THAT PITCOAL IS AN EARTH OR STONE CHIEFLY OF THE ARGILLACEOUS GENUS PENETRATED AND IMPREGNATED WITH BITUMEN BUT MR KIRWAN VERY JUSTLY REMARKS THAT THE INSUFFICIENCY OF THIS SOLUTION IS DEMONSTRATED BY KILKENNY AND OTHER COALS WHICH ARE DEVOID OF BITUMEN AND ALSO THAT THE QUANTITY OF EARTHY OR STONY MATTER IN THE MOST BITUMINOUS COALS BEARS NO PROPORTION TO THE WEIGHT OF THEM  GEOLOGICAL ESSAYS P 31636 MR HATCIETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE THE SECOND AND MOST PREVAILING OPINION IS THAT MINERAL COAL IS OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN THAT THE VEGETABLE BODIES HAVE SUBSE QUENT TO THEIR BEING BURIED UNDER VAST STRATA OF EARTH BEEN MI NERALIZED BY SOME UNKNOWN PROCESS OF WHICH SULPHURIC ACID HAS PROBABLY BEEN THE PRINCIPAL AGENT AND THAT BY MEANS OF THIS ACID THE OILS OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES OF WOOD HAVE BEEN CON VERTED INTO BITUMEN AND A COALY SUBSTANCE HAS BEEN FORMED THE THIRD OPINION IS THAT OF ARDUINO WHO CONCEIVES COAL TO BE ENTIRELY OF MARINE FORMATION AND TO HAVE ORIGINATED FROM THE FAT AND UNCTUOUS MATTER OF THE NUMEROUS TRIBES OF ANIMALS THAT INHABIT THE OCEAN AND THE FOURTH IS MR KIRWANS OPINION WHO CONSIDERS COAL AND BITUMEN TO HAVE BEEN DERIVED FROM THE PRIMORDIAL CHAOTIC FLUID THE LIMITS OF THIS PAPER WILL NOT PERMIT ME TO ENTER INTO THE VARIOUS ARGUMENTS AND FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ADDUCED IN THE SUPPORT OF THESE DIFFERENT OPINIONS BUT THE SECOND OR THAT WHICH REGARDS THE VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES AS THE PRINCIPAL ORIGIN OF COAL SEEMS BY MUCH THE MOST PROBABLE BECAUSE IT IS COR ROBORATED BY THE GREATER NUMBER OF GEOLOGICAL FACTS AS WELL AS BY MANY EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS MOST OF THE FORMER HAVE HOWEVER BEEN STATED IN DIFFERENT WORKS AND I SHALL THEREFORE ONLY NOTICE A FEW OF THE LATTER WHICH HAVE OCCURRED IN THE COURSE OF MY EXPERIMENTS THE OBSERVATIONS OF DR CORREA DE SERRA ON THE WOOD OF THE SUBMARINE FOREST AT SUTTON ON THE COAST OF LINCOLNSHIRE TOGETHER WITH MANY SIMILAR ACCOUNTS WHICH HAVE BEEN PUB LISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER WORKS DEMONSTRATE IN THE MOST SATISFACTORY MANNER THAT WHETHER  GEOLOGICAL ESSAYS P 327WHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANZNI 137 VEGETABLES ARE TOTALLY OR PARTIALLY BURIED UNDER THE WAVES OR UNDER THE EARTH THEY ARE NOT MERELY BY SUCH MEANS CON VERTED EVEN INTO THE MOST IMPERFECT SORT OF COAL SOME PROCESS THEREFORE INDEPENDENT OF THESE CIRCUMSTANCES MUST HAVE TAKEN PLACE IN ORDER THAT THE VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES SUCH AS LIGNEOUS MATTER RESIN OIL C SHOULD BECOME COAL AND BITUMEN IN A FORMER PAPER I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO SHEW THAT THESE CHANGES ARE PROGRESSIVE AND HAVING NOTICED THE PERFECT STATE OF THE SUBMERGED WOOD AT SUTTON AND OTHER PLACES I NEXT DESCRIBED THE QUALITIES OF THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF BOVEY COAL WHICH EXHIBIT A SERIES OF GRADUAL CHANGES FROM BODIES WHICH RETAIN THE VEGETABLE STRUCTURE AND TEXTURE ALTHOUGH IMPER FECTLY CARBONIZED TO OTHERS IN WHICH ALMOST THE COMPLETE CHARACTERS OF THE COMMON MINERAL OR PITCOAL ARE ABSOLUTELY ESTABLISHED FROM THE ALDER LEAVES IN THE SCHISTUS FROM ICELAND I OB TAINED EXTRACTIVE VEGETABLE MATTER AND ALTHOUGH THIS WAS NOT  IN MY PAPER  ON THE CHANGE OF SOME OF THE PROXIMATE PRINCIPLES OF VEGETABLES INTO BITUMEN I HAVE QUOTED THE REMARKS OF BERGMAN VON TROIL AND OTHERS ON THE COMPRESSED STATE OF THE TRUNKS OF THE TREES WHICH HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO SURTURBRAND BOVEY COAL AND SIMILAR SUBSTANCES THE SAME OBSERVATION HAS BEEN ALSO MADE BY DR CORRE A DE SERRA RESPECTING THE TIMBER OF THE SUBMARINE FOREST AT SUTTON AND THIS IS THE MORE REMARKABLE AS THE SUBMERGED VEGETABLES AT SUTTON DO NOT EXHIBIT ANY APPEARANCE OF CARBONIZATION DR CORREA SAYS  IN GENERAL THE TRUNKS BRANCHES AND ROOTS OF THE DECAYED  TREES WERE CONSIDERABLY FLATTENED WHICH IS A PHENOMENON OBSERVED IN THE SURTUR  BRAND OR FOSSIL WOOD OF ICELAND AND WHICH SC H EU C HZ E R REMARKED ALSO IN THE  FOSSIL WOOD FOUND IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE LAKE OF THUN IN SWITZERLAND PHIL TRANS

PARK AN ESTATE BELONGING TO SIR ELIJAH IMPEY AND ALSO THE SURTURBRAND OF ICELAND YIELDED SOME RESIN WHICH AT BOVEY IS LIKEWISE FOUND IN DISTINCT MASSES INTERMIXED WITH THE STRATA OF COAL AND COMBINED WITH AS PHALTUM IN THE PROPORTION OF ABOUT 41 PARTS OF THE LATTER WITH 55 OF RESIN NOW EXCLUSIVE OF THE OTHER VEGETABLE CHARACTERS WHICH ARE SO EVIDENT IN MANY OF THE VARIETIES OF BOVEY COAL OF THE SUSSEX COAL OF SURTURBRAND C C THE PRESENCE OF RESIN MUST BE REGARDED AS A STRONG FACT FOR THIS SUBSTANCE HAS ALWAYS BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE ORGANIZED BODIES PARTICULARLY TO THOSE OF THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM AND I DO NOT KNOW OF ANY INSTANCE PREVIOUS TO MY OWN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH RESIN HAD BEEN DISCOVERED AS CONSTITUTING PART OF ANY OF THE DIFFERENT SPECIES AND VARIETIES OF COAL FROM THE EXTERNAL VEGETABLE CHARACTERS POSSESSED BYTHE BOVEY COAL THE SUSSEX COAL THE SURTURBRAND AND MANY OTHERS TOGETHER WITH THE RESIN ALLOWED TO BE EXCLUSIVELY A VEGETABLE SUBSTANCE OR AT LEAST ONE WHICH ONLY APPERTAINS TO THE ORGANIZED NATURAL BODIES THERE CANNOT BE ANY DOUBT THAT SUCH COALS HAVE BEEN FORMED FROM WOOD AND OTHER SUB STANCES BELONGING TO THE VEGETABLE KINGDOM BUT SOME MINERALOGISTS ATTEMPT TO DRAW A LINE OF SEPARATION BETWEEN THE COALS ABOVE MENTIONED AND THE OTHERS WLHICH THEREFORE THEY CALL THE TRUE MINERAL COALS  OBSERVATIONS ON THE CHANGE OF SOME OF THE PROXIMATE PRINCIPLES OF VEGETABLES INTO BITUMEN PHIL TRANS 1804 P 40WHIC1 POSSESSES THE CHARACTERTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 13 THIS OPINION MAY IN SOME DEGREE BE REFUTED EVEN FROM THE SPECIMENS AFFORDED BY THE BOVEY COALPITS WHERE AS I HAVE OBSERVED A REGULAR GRADATION MAY BE SEEN FROM WOOD WHICH IS BUT VERY IMPERFECTLY CARBONIZED TO THE SUBSTANCE CALLED STONE COAL WHICH IN EVERY RESPECT APPEARS TO BE MOST NEARLY IF NOT ABSOLUTELY SIMILAR TO THE COMMON PITCOALS IT MAY HOWEVER BE OBJECTED THAT SUCH A TRANSITION IS PECU LIAR TO THIS AND SIMILAR PLACES AND THAT THE PITCOAL FOUND IN OTHER SITUATIONS WHERE NOTHING RESEMBLING THE BOVEY COAL CAN BE DISCOVERED IS IN REALITY OF A DIFFERENT NATURE BUT THIS OBJECTION I THINK MAY BE ANSWERED BY THE RESULTS OF THOSE EXPERIMENTS ON PITCOAL CANNEL COAL AND ASPHALTUM WHICH I HAVE RELATED IN THE THIRD SECTION OF THIS PAPER FOR WHEN THESE WERE SUBJECTED TO THE ACTION OF NITRIC ACID NOT TOO LONG CONTINUED IT WAS FOUND THAT THE ACID FIRST DISSOLVED THE PRINCIPAL PART OF THE CARBONACEOUS MATTER AND IF THEN THE PROCESS WAS STOPPED THERE REMAINED A SUBSTANCE IN A PRO PORTION CORRESPONDING TO THAT OF THE BITUMEN EITHER IN THE PITCOAL OR PRINCIPALLY FORMING THE CANNEL COAL AND ASPHAL TUM WHICH ALTHOUGH NOT ABSOLUTELY IN THE STATE OF RESIN WAS HOWEVER IN A STATE INTERMEDIATE BETWEEN IT AND THE VEGETABLE EXTRACTIVE MATTER MOREOVER I HAVE STATED THAT UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES A SUBSTANCE POSSESSING IN A GREAT MEASURE THE SAME PROPERTIES MAY BE OBTAINED FROM THE KNOWN VEGETABLE RESINS BY THE ACTION OF NITRIC ACID WHEN THEREFORE THESE FACTS ARE ADDED TO THAT OF THE PHIL TRANS 1804 P 39814O MR HATCHETTS EXPERIMENTS ON A SUBSTANCE NATURAL MIXTURE OF RESIN AND ASPHALTUM WHICH IS FOUND WITH THE BOVEY COAL WE TO ALL APPEARANCE HAVE ALMOST POSITIVE PROOF THAT THE PITCOALS ARE OF VEGETABLE ORIGIN TRUE IT IS INDEED THAT BITUMEN HAS NEVER BEEN FORMED BY ANY ARTIFICIAL PROCESS HITHERTO DEVISED FROM THE RESINS OR OTHER VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES I HAVE MYSELF ATTEMPTED IT IN VARIOUS WAYS WITHOUT SUCCESS FOR ALTHOUGH I OCCASIONALLY OBTAINED PRODUCTS WHICH RESEMBLED IT SOMEWHAT IN ODOUR WHEN BURNED AND OTHER PROPERTIES YET THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL OR WATER ALWAYS PROVED THESE PRODUCTS NOT TO BE BITUMEN BUT SYNTHESIS OF NATURAL PRODUCTS ALTHOUGH REQUIRED IN STRICT CHEMICAL DEMONSTRATION IS AS WE HAVE BUT TOO OFTEN OCCASION TO KNOW SELDOM TO BE ATTAINED ESPECIALLY WHEN OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED ON BODIES WHOSE COMPONENT PARTS ARE LIABLE TO AN INFINITE SERIES OF VARIATIONS IN THEIR PROPORTIONS QUALITIES AND MODE OF COMBINATION CONSIDERING THEREFORE THAT BITUMEN AND RESIN AFFORD BY CERTAIN OPERATIONS SIMILAR PRODUCTS THAT RESIN AND BITUMEN ARE FOUND BLENDED TOGETHER BY NATURE AND THAT THIS MIXED SUBSTANCE ACCOMPANIES A SPECIES OF COAL WHICH IN MANY PARTS STILL EXHIBITS ITS VEGETABLE ORIGIN WHILST IN OTHERS IT PASSES INTO PITCOAL WE MAY WITH THE GREATEST PROBABILITY CONCLUDE THAT BITUMEN IS A MODIFICATION OF THE RESINOUS AND OILY PARTS OF VEGETABLES PRODUCED BY SOME PROCESS OF NATURE WHICH HAS OPERATED BY SLOW AND GRADUAL MEANS ON IMMENSE MASSES SO THAT EVEN IF WE WERE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PROCESS WE SHOULD SCARCELY BE ABLE TO IMITATE ITS EFFECTS FROM THE WANT OF TIME AND DEFICIENCY IN THE BULK OF MATERIALS BUT ALTHOUGH BITUMEN CANNOT AT PRESENT BE ARTIFICIALLYWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 11 FORMED FROM THE RESINOUS AND OTHER VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES BY ANY OF THE KNOWN CHEMICAL PROCESSES YET THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE AGENT EMPLOYED BY NATURE IN THE FORMATION OF COAL AND BITUMEN HAS BEEN EITHER MURIATIC OR SULPHURIC ACID AND WHEN IT IS CONSIDERED THAT COMMON SALT IS NEVER FOUND IN COAL MINES EXCEPT WHEN IN THE VICINITY OF SALT SPRINGS WHILST ON THE CONTRARY PYRITES SULPHATE OF IRON AND ALUM MOST COMMONLY ARE PRESENT  THESE FACTS TOGETHER WITH THE SULPHUREOUS ODOUR EMITTED BY MOST OF THE MINERAL COALS WHEN BURNED APPEAR STRONGLY TO EVINCE THE AGENCY OF THE LATTER THAT THIS HAS BEEN THE CASE SEEMS ALSO TO BE CORROBORATED BY THE GREAT RESEMBLANCE WHICH AS HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY STATED THE COALS FORMED ARTIFICIALLY FROM MANY VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES BEAR TO THE MINERAL COALS ESPECIALLY AS THE SIMILARITY IS NOT CONFINED TO EXTERNAL CHARACTERS BUT EXTENDS TO OTHER PROPERTIES BY THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON VEGETABLE BODIES A MUCH GREATER PORTION OF THEIR CARBON IS CONVERTED INTO COAL THAN WHEN THE SAME ARE SUBJECTED TO THE EFFECTS OF FIRE SEVERAL EXAMPLES RESPECTING THE RESINS HAVE BEEN MEN TIONED IN THE SEVENTH SECTION OF THIS PAPER AND THE RE SULT OF THE EXPERIMENT MADE UPON OAK PERFECTLY ACCORDS WITH THEM MR PROUST IN THE COURSE OF SOME COMPARATIVE EXPERIMENTS ON THE PROPORTIONS OF CHARCOAL AFFORDED BY DIFFERENT KINDS OF WOOD OBTAINED 2O PER CENT FROM GREEN OAK AND IG PER

PART OF THE COALS OBTAINED BY THE LUMID WAY FROM RESINOUS SUBSTANCES THE EXPERIMENT ON OAK ALSO APPEARS TO REFUTE ANOTHER OBJECTION TO THE VEGETABLE ORIGIN OF PITCOAL NAMELY THE TOTAL ABSENCE OF THE ALKALIS WHICH ON THE CONTRARY ARE SO CONSTANTLY OBTAINED FROM THE LIGNEOUS PARTS OF VEGETABLES BY COMBUSTION BUT I HAVE SHEWN THAT WHEN THESE BODIES ARE CARBONIZED IN THE HUMID WAY EITHER BY MURIATIC OR BY SULPHURIC ACID NOT ANY ALKALI CAN BE OBTAINED FROM THE ASHES OF COALS SO FORMED AND THIS SEEMS ALSO TO BE A FARTHER PROOF THAT THE HUMID WAY HAS BEEN EMPLOYED IN THE OPERATIONS OF NATURE TO CONVERT THE ABOVE MENTIONED SUBSTANCES INTO PITCOAL FOR SUPPOSING FIRE TO HAVE BEEN THE AGENT IT DOES NOT APPEAR EASY TO CONCEIVE HOW THE ALKALI COULD HAVE BEEN DESTROYED OR SEPARATEDT  KIIWANS GEOLOGICAL ESSAYS P 3Z20  SOME HAVE ATTEMPTED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ABSENCE OF ALKALI IN THE BOVEY COAL AND COMMON PITCOAL BY SUPPOSING THAT THE VEGETABLE BODIES FROM WHICH THESE HAVE BEEN FORMED WERE PREVIOUSLY DEPRIVED OF ALKALI BY SIMPLE LIXIVIATION DURING THEIR IMMERSION IN WATER BUT IN PAGE 127 OF THIS PAPER I HAVE SHEWN THAT THE SUBMERGED OAK OF SUTTON ALTHOUGH DEPRIVED OF ITS TANNIN STILL RETAINED ITS POTASH WHICH CER TAINLY WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN THE CASE IF THE LATTER LIKE THE FORMER COULD HAVE BEEN SEPARATED FROM THE WOOD BY MERE SOLUTION WHEN WOOD IS REDUCED TO ASHES THE ALKALI BECOMES COMPLETELY DENUDED BY THE DESTRUCTION OF THE WOODY FIBRE AND CONSEQUENTLY MAY BE IMMEDIATELY TAKEN UP BY WATER BUT WHEN WOOD IS CONVERTED INTO COAL IN THE HUMID WAY BY MEANS OF AN ACID THEN IT SEEMS TO ME THAT TWO EFFECTSWHIC POSSESSES TIHE CHARACTERISTIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 143 EVERY IRCUMSTANE SEEMS THEREFORE TO SUPPORT THE OPINION OF THOSE WHO EONSIDERTHE PITCOALS AS HAVING BEEN FORMED IN THE HUMID WAY PRINCIPALLY FROM VEGETABLE BODIES AND MOST PROBABLY BY THE AGENCY OF SULPHURIC ACID AND ALLOWING THAT ANIMAL SUBSTANCES MAY ALSO HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRODUCTION OF COAL YET THIS

EXPRESSMY SENTIMENTS RESPECTING THE MOST PROBABLE OF THE FORMER OPINIONS SINCE HOWEVER THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN AND PARTLY READ BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY I HAVE BEEN FAVOURED BY SIR JAMES HALL WITH A

CONSIDERING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE LATTER IT WILL NOT APPEAR SURPRISING THAT IT SHOULD IMMEDIATELY HAVE ENGAGED THE PRIN CIPAL PART OF MY ATTENTION IN ADDITION TO THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN RELATED IN THE THREE PAPERS UPON THIS SUBJECT I INTENDED TO HAVE DECOM POSED THE DIFFERENT VARIETIES TO HAVE COMPARED THEIR GASES AND OTHER PRODUCTS WITH THOSE OF THE NATURAL SUBSTANCE CALLED TANNIN AND ESPECIALLY TO HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DISCOVER MORE ECONOMICAL METHODS OF OBTAINING THE ARTIFICIAL PRODUCT FOR EXCLUSIVE OF SPECULATIVE SCIENCE THIS APPEARS TO BE AN OBJECT OF CONSEQUENCE NOT ONLY RESPECTING THAT USEFUL AND VALUABLE BRANCH OF MANUFACTURE TO WHICH IT IMMEDIATELY RELATES BUT ALSO AS THE MEANS OF PREVENTING OR AT LEAST OF DIMINISHING THE PREMATURE DESTRUCTION OF TIMBER IN A COUNTRY WHERE ON ACCOUNT OF ITS POPULATION AS WELL AS ON ACCOUNT OF ITS MARITIME NOT SOLVE THE GRAND GEOLOGICAL PROBLEM THEY MUST EVEN IN AN INSULATED POINT OF VIEW BE ALLOWED TO HAVE OPENED A NEW AND UNEXPLORED FIELD OF RESEARCH IN CHEMISTRY AS WELL AS IN GEOLOGY IN THE 8TH SECTION OF THIS VALUABLE PAPER THE AUTHOR HAS GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF SOME EXPERIMENTS MADE ON LEATHER HORN AND FIR SAWDUST FROM WHICH HE OBTAINED COAL WHICH BURNED WITH FLAME AND WHICH APPARENTLY RESEMBLED SOME OF THE MINERAL COALS IN ONE CASE ALSO HE OBTAINED A SUBSTANCE WHICH IN EXTERNAL CHARACTERS APPEARED SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE MIXTURE OF ASPHALTUM AND RESIN FOUND AT BOVEY TO WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE NAME OF RETINASPHALTUM THESE EXPERIMENTS SIR JAMES HALL INTENDS TO RESUME AND IT IS MY EARNEST WISH THAT HE WOULD DO SO FOR ALTHOUGH I AM STRONGLY INCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT THE MINERAL COALS HAVE GENERALLY IF NOT ALWAYS BEEN FORMED BY SOME HUMID PROCESS YET IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO FORESEE THE RESULTS WHICH MAY BE OBTAINED FROM ANIMAL AND VEGETABLE BODIES SUBJECTED TO THE EFFECTS OF HEAT MODI FIED BY COMPRESSION AS THE PRINCIPBLS OF THESE BODIES MAY BE ACTED UPON AND MAY BE MADE TO REACT ON EACH OTHER UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH UNTIL NOW HAVE NOT BEEN IMAGINEDWHICH POSSESSES THE CHARACTERISLIC PROPERTIES OF TANNIN 145 POSITION EVERY ECONOMY IN SUCH AN ARTICLE SHOULD BE MOST RIGIDLY OBSERVED BUT FOR THE PRESENT I INTEND TO RELINQUISH THIS SUBJECT TO SUCH AS MAY CONSIDER IT WORTHY OF ATTENTION WHILST AS I HAVE ALREADY STATED I ENTERTAIN VERY SANGUINE EXPECTATIONS THAT EVENTUALLY IT WILL PROVE ECONOMICALLY USEFUL AND SHOULD ANY BE INCLINED TO PURSUE THE INQUIRY I WOULD RECOMMEND PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THOSE PROCESSES WHICH RELATE TO THE ROASTED VEGETABLE SUBSTANCES AND TO PEAT ALMOST ANY REFUSE VEGETABLE MATTER SUCH AS TWIGS DEAD LEAVES C WILL SERVE FOR THE FORMER WHILST THE LATTER AS I HAVE SHEWN DOES NOT REQUIRE TO BE ROASTED AND IN MANY ESPECIALLY THE NORTHERN COUNTIES PEAT IS FOUND IN SUCH ABUN DANCE THAT BUT A SMALL PROPORTIONAL QUANTITY IS CONSUMED IN THE ONLY USEFUL WAY TO WHICH IT HAS HITHERTO BEEN APPLIED NAMELY FUEL BEFORE I CONCLUDE THIS PAPER I SHALL ALSO OBSERVE THAT THE EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED MUST BE REGARDED ONLY AS A MERE SKETCH OF THAT WHICH MAY BE PERFORMED WHILST THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN ASCERTAINED RE SPECTING THE RESINS BALSAMS GUM RESINS AND GUMS SERVE TO PROVE THAT MUCH MAY BE EXPECTED FROM REGULAR CHE MICAL EXAMINATIONS OF THESE BODIES BUT SUCH INVESTIGATIONS IN ORDER THAT SCIENCE MAY TRULY BE PROMOTED SHOULD BE STRICTLY

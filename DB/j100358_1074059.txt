J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1074059,ON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS,I244459,ON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS FOR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND HUMAN BROTHERHOOD THEY AND THEIR FELLOWS ON EITHER SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC ARE TO US A GRANDER LEGACY THAN MARATHON TO ATHENS AND WHEN OUR SYSTEMS OF INSTRUCTION SHALL BE ROUNDED OUT TO THEIR COMPLETION THE GREAT BOOKS THAT OUR ENGLISHSPEAKING MEN HAVE MADE SHALL DO THEIR PROPER PART IN MAKING MEN JOHN GREENE COLGATE UNIVERSITY ON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN HIS ARGUMENT THAT APPEARS IN THE SEPTEMBER ISSUE OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW URGING GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS DR MACKENZIE IS CLEARLY RIGHT IN THE STATEMENT THAT SCHOOL SUPERVISION IS A LEADING QUESTION IN EDUCATION AT THE PRES ENT DAY BUT SURELY HE MUST EXPECT THAT MANY INTERESTED IN EDU CATION WILL TAKE ISSUE WITH HIM WHEN HE LAYS DOWN THE PROPOSI TION THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS SHOULD BE SO SUPERVISED WHILE MEN MAY AGREE THAT OUR ENTIRE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM HAS FAULTS THAT SHOULD BE RELIEVED THERE MUST IN THE NATURE OF THINGS BE A WIDE VARIANCE OF OPINION AS TO THE CORRECTIVE PRINCIPLE TO BE APPLIED THERE CAN BE NO DOUBT THAT LACK OF UNITY OF PURPOSE DEFINITE NESS OF AIM AND COHERENCE OF ORGANIZATION IS THE DISTINCTIVE DE FECT OF EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN THE UNITED STATES TODAY THE ABSENCE OF PROPER RELATIONS BETWEEN SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND COL LEGES AND OF UNIFORM REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO COLLEGE THE INEQUALITY OF THE WORK LEADING TO THE BACHELORS DEGREE AND THE ALMOST TOTAL LACK OF ADEQUATE REQUIREMENT FOR ADMISSION TO MOST PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS ARE THE RESULTS OF ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS THAT HAVE TENDED TO BRING EDUCATIONAL MATTERS IN OUR COUNTRY TO THEIR PRESENT UNFORTUNATE STATUS EDUCATIONAL TRADITIONS AND METHODS AMONG US ARE THE OUT GROWTH OF OUR OWN PECULIAR ENVIRONMENT AND CONDITIONS OF LIFE FREEDOM LIBERTY AND ABSENCE OF RESTRAINT OF OLDER CONVENTIONAL ISMS MARK THE DISTINCTLY AMERICAN MOVEMENTS IN POLITICS AND SOCIOLOGY EDUCATION TOO AMONG US HAS BEEN EVOLVED FROM CON DITIONS AND FACTS THAT WERE PRESENT AT HOME WITH US NOT FOREIGN 557THE SCHOOL REVIEW NOT IMPOSED UPON US FROM ABOVE BUT GROWN OF NATIVE ROOT IN NATIVE SOIL IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT ITS GROWTH HAS BEEN ALL TOO UNTENDED AND UNNURTURED AND THAT LIKE  TOPSY  IT HAS SIMPLY  GROWED BE THAT AS IT MAY THERE CAN BE LITTLE DOUBT THAT OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE INDIGENOUS A HOME PRODUCT AND HENCE HAVE A FITNESS OF A HIGH ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR WORK TO THIS SPONTANEITY IS ATTRIBUTABLE THEIR INDIVIDUALITY AND INDE PENDENCE VALUABLE AS IS THIS NATIVE QUALITY OF EDUCATION IN THE UNITED STATES THERE ARE EVILS ATTENDING IT THAT ARE SUGGESTED IN THE SEPARATENESS THAT EXISTS BETWEEN OUR VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS OF THE SAME AND OF DIFFERENT GRADES FROM THIS ISOLATION AS A SOURCE COMES LACK OF COHERENCE AND UNITY THERE CAN BE BUT ONE RESULT TO ALL THIS  THERE MUST BE A GREAT WASTE OF POWER MISDIRECTED ENERGY MAY BE MORE DISASTROUS IN ITS EFFECTS THAN UNUSED ENERGY OUR EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE SUFFERING FROM THE RESULTS OF UN WISELY APPLIED PEDAGOGIC POWER UNIFORM AND SYMMETRICAL ORGANIZATION CAN ALONE PREVENT THIS WASTE OF FORCE AND GIVE A WISE AND ECONOMIC APPLICATION TO THE GREAT WORK AWAITING EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY TODAY STRONG WISE CATHOLIC SUPERVISION IS NEEDED WHENCE SHOULD SPRING THE AUTHORITY TO SUPERVISE  WHAT INSTITUTIONS SHOULD BE SUPERVISED  AND HOW  THE ANSWERING OF THESE QUESTIONS WILL DISCLOSE DIFFER ENCES OF OPINION MORE OR LESS RADICAL IT OCCURS TO US IMMEDIATELY THAT ALL PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SUPER VISED IN THE UNITED STATES THE THOUGHT THAT THEY ARE IN THE MAJORITY OF CASES WISELY AND PATRIOTICALLY SUPERVISED WOULD NOT OCCUR TO THE MIND WITH THE SAME IMMEDIATENESS WHILE WAIVING THE QUESTION TO WHAT POINT THE STATE SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EDUCATION OF ITS CHILDREN AND WHETHER A UNIFORMLY WISE SUPERVI VISION HAS BEEN ARRIVED AT FOR THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS AS AMERICANS WE ALL GLADLY ADMIT THE INESTIMABLE VALUE TO THE NATION OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND ADMIT THE NECESSITY OF STATE AND MUNICIPAL SUPERVI SION OF ALL SCHOOLS WHOSE ORIGIN IS DUE TO STATE OR NATIONAL ENACT MENT THERE IS HOWEVER A SERIOUS IMPORTANCE TO THE ARGUMENT AGAINST PATERNALISM IN GOVERNMENT AND THERE ARE APPARENT LIMITS WITHIN WHICH GOVERNMENT AID AND GOVERNMENT CONTROL MAY BE SOLICITED AMONG A FREE PEOPLE THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IS NOT TO AB SORB THOSE DUTIES THAT BELONG TO INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALISM AS DR MACKENZIE PHRASES IT  INTELLIGENT INDIVIDUALISM IS NOW THE 558ON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS REGULATIVE PRINCIPLE THERE IS SUCH AN INFLUENCE AS THE GENIUS OF A PEOPLE AND THE GENIUS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS DISTINCTLY OPPOSED TO INDISCRIMINATE INTERFERENCE OF CENTRALIZED GOVERNMENT IN SOME AT LEAST OF WHAT MAY BE EVEN THE DEAREST INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE  GOVERNMENT IS NOT ALWAYS A SAFE WORD WITH WHICH TO CONJURE THERE ARE GREAT NEEDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT WILL NOT ANSWER ITS SUMMONS SURELY NO TRUE AMERICAN DOUBTS THE WISDOM OF THE DIVORCE OF CHURCH AND STATE IN THE UNITED STATES YET THE RE LIGIOUS INTERESTS OF THE PEOPLE ARE TRANSCENDENT INTERESTS THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION OF THE INTERESTS OF THE CITIZENS IS NOT IN THE RATIO OF THE PRECIOUSNESS OF THE SPECIAL INTERESTS IN VOLVED WERE THIS SO THEN THE ARGUMENT THAT DR MACKENZIE CON STRUCTS ON THE NEEDED SUPERVISION OF THE PILOTAGE SYSTEM OF NEW YORK MIGHT HOLD AS HE SEEMS TO THINK IT SHOULD AS AN ARGUMENT FOR GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS WE MIGHT INDEED THEN GO TO THE FISH MARKET AND SHAMBLES AS WE ARE INVITED TO THAT WE MIGHT DISCOVER SOME ADEQUATE ARRANGEMENT OF SUPERVISION FOR OUR PRIVATE SCHOOLS THE THOUGHT CERTAINLY MUST OCCUR TO DR MACKENZIE THAT IN DEALING WITH QUESTIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND PERSONAL SAFETY OF LIFE AND LIMB AND THE TRAINING OF SOLDIERS AND SAILORS FOR PUBLIC DE FENCE HE IS DEALING WITH THE MOST UNDISPUTED FUNCTIONS OF GOV ERNMENT BUT THAT WHEN HE APPROACHES THE QUESTION OF THE RELA TION OF GOVERNMENT TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE THE RESULT OF THE EFFORTS OF A SINGLE INDIVIDUAL OR OF A CORPORATION TO ACHIEVE CERTAIN DEFINITE ENDS IN EDUCATION HE IS CONCERNED WITH AN ENTIRELY DIFFERENT KIND OF FACTS FACTS SO UNRELATED THAT THEY ARE NOT AKIN TO THOSE HE HAS MARSHALLED IN HIS ARGUMENT AND SO CAUSE HIS ILLUSTRATIVE ARGU MENT TO FAIL THROUGH LACK OF PARALLELISM DOES NOT HIS ARGUMENT REALLY FALL INTO THE FOLLOWING SYLLOGISTIC FORM  THE FUNCTION OF GOVERNMENT IS TO SECURE THE GOOD OF ITS CITIZENS GOVERNMENTAL SUPERVISION OF A FISHMONGER SECURES THE GOOD OF ITS CITIZENS THEREFORE GOVERNMENT SHOULD SUPERVISE PRIVATE SCHOOLS DR MACKENZIE WILL NOT CARE LONG TO MEET HIS OWN ARGUMENT WHEN REDUCED TO A FORM THAT PROVES ITS OWN ABSURD ITY ON THE SOUND PRINCIPLE OF KEEPING THE GOVERNMENT WITHIN THOSE LINES THAT CLEARLY MARK ITS COMPETENCY PRIVATE SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE SUPERVISED BY THE GOVERNMENT THE SURE TAINT OF POLITICS USING DR MACKENZIES WORDS IS TO BE DEPRECATED THE CONDITION OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN MANY 559THE SCHOOL REVIEW OF OUR GREAT CITIES IS TOO WELL KNOWN TO ALLOW US TO WINK OUT OF SIGHT THE INEVITABLE DAMAGE THAT WOULD COME TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS IF PLACED UNDER GOVERNMENT SUPERVISION ONE IMMENSE ADVANTAGE PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAVE TODAY OVER THE PUBLIC SCHOOL IS FREEDOM FROM THE IGNORANCE AND ENMITY OF THE PUBLIC SCHOOL BOARD THE AU TONOMY THAT IS THEIRS HAS ENABLED THEM IN MANY INSTANCES TO EX ERCISE A WISE AND BRAVE LEADERSHIP IN EDUCATIONAL MATTERS THEY HAVE CHERISHED AN ALERT AND INQUISITIVE SPIRIT OF SCHOLARSHIP THAT HAS RESULTED IN A HOSPITALITY TO TRUTH THAT HAS MADE THEM THE PROP ER FIELD FOR EXPERIMENT AND PROGRESS THE ROSE IS NO REMOTER FROM THE THORN THAN IS THE THORN FROM THE ROSE IF THE LACK OF UNI FORMITY THAT WE REGRET IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS HAS ITS FAULTS IT HAS ALSO ITS EXCELLENCIES THE UNIQUE SCHOOL IS POSSIBLE UNDER IT AND THE UNIQUE TEACHER A SAM TAYLOR MAY BE EVOLVED WHO CAN USE BOTH HANDS AND ALL HIS BRAINS IN FASHIONING A PHILLIPS ANDOVER GIVE US TEN THOUSAND TIMES OVER AN UNSUPERVISED RUGBY WITH A THOMAS ARNOLD AT ITS HEAD TRAINING INSPIRING MAKING MEN RATHER THAN A SCORE OF GERMAN GYMNASIEN SUPERVISED AND DESICCATED AND RE FINED TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF GERMAN FORMALISM AND ROUTINE WHILE BELIEVING THAT PRIVATE SCHOOLS SHOULD NOT BE SUPERVISED BY BOARDS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNMENT AND CERTAINLY NOT FOR THE REASONS ADVANCED BY DR MACKENZIE I AM ENTIRELY READY TO ADMIT AS ALREADY STATED THAT SUPERVISION IS DESIRABLE AND NECESSARY OUR CONTENTION THEN WITH DR MACKENZIE IS NOT AS TO THE QUESTION OF SUPERVISION BUT AS TO THE ORIGIN OF THE SUPERVISING POWER FOR THE PURPOSE OF ECONOMY OF FORCE WITHOUT WHICH NO EDUCA TIONAL SYSTEM CAN BE WISE SUPERVISORY POWER SHOULD BE EXERCISED OVER ALL PREPARATORY SCHOOLS WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRIVATE BY A COM MISSION APPOINTED BY THE FACULTIES OF THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSI TIES ONENESS OF AIM SYMMETRY OF DEVELOPMENT AND COHERENCE WOULD THEN BE SECURED AND THE ENORMOUS FRICTION OF THE PRESENT STATE OF AFFAIRS GREATLY REDUCED THE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES ARE THE RIGHTFUL SOURCE OF SUCH INFLUENCE AS SHOULD BE FOUND IN A SUPERVISING BOARD FOR SECONDARY SCHOOLS INTELLIGENT SUPERVISION WOULD THUS BE POSSIBLE THE CORRUPTION OF POLITICS IMPOSSIBLE ACADEMIC AND NOT PERSONAL PARTISAN INFLU ENCE WOULD BE OPERATIVE AND THE LEAVEN COMING FROM THE NATURAL SOURCE THE HIGHER INSTITUTIONS WOULD TEND TO RAISE THE ENTIRE GRADE OF PREPARATORY SCHOOLS TO THE HIGH LEVEL OF UNQUESTIONED USEFULNESS AND HARMONY OF EFFORT AND AIM 56OON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS HOWEVER BEFORE SUCH A SUPERVISING BODY COULD BE THUS AP POINTED WITH REGULATIVE POWER OVER PRIVATE AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS THE COLLEGES THEMSELVES SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO GIVE CLEAR DEFINI TIONS OF MUCH OF THE NOMENCLATURE CURRENT AMONG THEM AND SHOULD BE EXPECTED TO COME TO FULL AGREEMENT ON SEVERAL POINTS OF VARIANCE WHAT WILL THEY UNDERSTAND THE DEGREE OF BACHELOR OF ARTS TO MEAN OR THE MASTERS DEGREE  WHAT WORK IN QUALITY AND AMOUNT SHALL LEAD TO THESE DEGREES  SHALL THERE NOT BE A PRACTICAL AGREEMENT IN THE CHARACTER OF THE REQUIREMENTS FOR ADMISSION TO COLLEGE FOR CANDIDATES FOR THE SAME DEGREE  SHALL THERE NOT BE AN AGREEMENT AS TO THE CHARACTER AND AMOUNT OF TRAINING THAT LEAD TO THE BACHELORS DEGREE  SHALL NOT THE OLD INFLEXIBILITY BE SUFFICIENTLY RELAXED TO ALLOW THE ACCEPTANCE OF A REAL EQUIVALENCY OF WORK  AN AGREEMENT ON THESE AND ON POINTS THAT MAY FURTHER BE SUG GESTED SHOULD BE REACHED BEFORE THE COLLEGES CAN BE THEMSELVES IN THE DEGREE OF HARMONY TO ENABLE THEM TO ARRANGE A CONSISTENT PROGRAM FOR THE SCONDARY SCHOOLS WE ALL HOPE TO HEAR THAT A LARGE CONCURRENCE HAS BEEN REACHED BY THE MEMBERS OF THE VARIOUS CONFERENCES APPOINTED BY THE NA TIONAL ASSOCIATION WHOSE REPORT IS TO BE MADE BY THEIR CHAIRMAN PRESIDENT ELIOT AT THE FORTHCOMING MEETING OF COLLEGES AND PRE PARATORY SCHOOLS ITL NEW HAVEN ALL SIGNS POINT TO AN EDUCATIONAL AWAKENING SUCH AS THIS COUN TRY HAS NEVER KNOWN BUT IN OUR SPASM FOR A REGULATIVE PRINCIPLE LET US BE CAREFUL WHENCE WE INVOKE OUR KING LET US NEVER FORGET THAT EVEN SO GOOD AN END AS METHOD IS NOT TO BE THE ULTIMATE RE SULT OF THE TEACHERS WORK WE ARE NOT TO STOP SHORT EVEN WITH THE HIGH ART OF TRAINING OUR PUPILS TO THINK FEELING EMOTION IDEALISM MUST BE THE GREAT OBJECTIVE FORMALISM AND MERE UNIN SPIRED METHOD CAN NEVER SECURE THESE GREAT ENDS LET US NOT FEEL IN OUR PERPLEXITY THAT WE CAN BRING IN THE STRONG ARM OF STATE AU THORITY AS A DEUS EX MACHINA TO DELIVER US D WV ABERCROMBIE WORCESTER ACADEMN OCT 9 1893 56ITHE SCHOOL REVIEW TO THE EDITORS OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW GENTLEMEN LET ME THANK YOU FOR SENDING ME ADVANCE SHEETS OF THE ARTICLE BY DR MACKENZIE ON THE SUPERVISION OF PRI VATE SCHOOLS BY THE STATE IT GIVES ME PLEASURE TO COMPLY WITH YOUR REQUEST THAT I SHOULD STATE MY VIEW OF THE QUESTION I HAVE READ THE ARTICLE WITH MUCH INTEREST AND SINCERELY SYMPA THIZE WITH THE AUTHORS EARNESTNESS IN THE DISCUSSION OF AN IMPOR TANT TOPIC DOUBTLESS THE LARGE NUMBER OF PRIVATE AND ENDOWED SCHOOLS IN THIS COUNTRY WOULD BE GREATLY IMPROVED BY A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF ORGANIZATION AND SUPERVISION THE SERIOUS WORDS OF HORACE MANN FIFTY YEARS AGO QUOTED BY THE AUTHOR ARE APPLICA BLE TO MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS TODAY BUT I DOUBT WHETHER AS MANY OF THESE SCHOOLS NOT SUBJECT TO SUPERVISION AND WITH NO BOND OF UNION CAN NOW BE FOUND IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK AS IN NEW ENGLAND AND IN OTHER STATES WITH WHICH THE AUTHOR MAY BE MORE FAMILIAR ALL READERS OF DR MACKENZIES ARTICLE SHOULD KNOW AND DOUBTLESS MOST OF THEM DO KNOW THAT THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS A SYSTEMATIC METHOD OF ORGANIZATION AND SUPERVISION WHICH MAY BE ACCEPTED BY ALL HER SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND WHICH IS ACCEPTED BY MOST OF THEM THIS PLAN CORRESPONDS IN GENERAL AND IN MANY PARTICULARS WITH THAT WHICH THE DOCTOR ADVOCATES SO WISELY AND WELL TO THIS ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN GIVEN VERY PROPERLY THE NAME UNIVERSITY TO THIS UNIVERSITY ALL INCORPORATED INSTITU TIONS OF ACADEMIC AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE MAY BE ADMITTED BY THE REGENTS THE OBJECT OF THE UNIVERSITY IS IN ALL PROPER WAYS TO ENCOURAGE PROMOTE AND SUPERVISE ACADEMIC AND HIGHER EDUCATION SINCE I784 FOR O09 YEARS HIGHER EDUCATION IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK HAS BEEN EFFICIENTLY AND INCREASINGLY SUPERVISED UNTIL NOW THE UNIVERSITY COMPRISES MORE THAN 500 EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TEACHING NEARLY 64000 PUPILS AND EX PENDING DURING THE LAST YEAR MORE THAN SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS THIS WORK OF SUPERVISION IS CARRIED ON THROUGH PUBLISHED REPORTS AND BY FREQUENT VISITATION AND CAREFUL INSPECTION AND FREQUENT EXAMINATIONS BESIDES BY CALLING TOGETHER THE TEACHERS OF THE STATE ANNUALLY IN A CONVOCATION AT THE CAPITAL IN ALBANY THE RE GENTS ENCOURAGE THE COMPARISON AND DISCUSSION OF EDUCATIONAL OPINIONS AND PRACTICE FOR THIRTYONE YEARS THESE CONVOCATIONS HAVE BEEN HELD WITH INCREASING INTEREST AND A LARGER ATTENDANCE UNTIL AN ACCOMPLISHED EDITOR OF A LEADING EDUCATIONAL JOURNAL HAS RECENTLY SAID  I REALLY THINK THE CONVOCATION IS TODAY THE MOST 562ON SUPERVISING PRIVATE SCHOOLS IMPORTANT MEETING OF TEACHERS IN THIS COUNTRY AND I AM SURE IT IS GOING TO BE RECOGNIZED MORE AND MORE BY PROMINENT TEACHERS IN OTHER STATES AS AN OCCASION THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS THE MORE CAREFULLY THE SUPERVISORY WORK OF THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK  IS EXAMINED THE MORE PLAINLY WILL IT APPEAR THAT WHAT HORACE MANN CALLED FOR FIFTY YEARS AGO IS FOUND IN IT WE HAVE IN THE UNIVERSITY A LIVING INSTITUTION AN ANI MATE ORGANIZATION WHICH CAN AND DOES AT LEAST EMBODY AND DIFFUSE ALL THAT IS NOW KNOWN IN EDUCATION AND THEREBY SAVES EVERY YEAR HUNDREDS OF CHILDREN FROM BEING SACRIFICED TO EXPERIMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED TIMES EXPLODED THROUGH THE AGENCY OF THE UNIVERSITY EVERY TEACHER CAN LAY TRIBUTE UPON CAPITALIZED EXPERIENCE WE HAVE THEN IN THE UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK AS MANAGED BY THE REGENTS AN EXAMPLE OF THAT SYSTEMATIC SUPERVI SION WHICH DR MACKENZIE ADVOCATES MOST ENDOWED SCHOOLS IN THE STATE OF NEW YORK ARE ALREADY MEMBERS OF THE UNIVERSITY NO SUCH SCHOOL IN THIS STATE NEED BE LONGER ISOLATED ALL MAY ENJOY THE STIMULATING AS WELL AS REGULATING INFLUENCE OF SUCH ASSOCIATION NO ESSENTIAL RIGHTS NEED BE SURRENDERED THE REGENTS PRACTICE NO MEDDLESOME PATERNALISM EVERY SUCH CHARTERED SCHOOL GAINS A VALUABLE RECOGNITION AND ASSOCIATION CORPORATE RIGHTS ARE MADE MORE PERMANENT AND MORE PRACTICALLY EFFICIENT CONSIDERABLE MONEY IS APPORTIONED ANNUALLY TO EACH SCHOOL WHY SHOULD NOT SIMILAR ORGANIZATIONS BE ESTABLISHED IN OTHER STATES  ANSON J UPSON CHANCELLOR OF THE UNIVERSITY GLENS FALLS N Y OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK FAILURE TO APPRECIATE CONDITIONS IT IS LATE IN THE DAY TO ARGUE THE GENERAL ADVANTAGES OF SUPER VISION AS PROFESSOR MACKENZIE DOES IN THE SEPTEMBER NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW IT WOULD BE MORE TO THE POINT TO ANALYZE THE CONDITIONS OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE FITTING SCHOOLS SUPERVISION HAS DONE LITTLE FOR PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS SUCCESSFUL FITTING 563THE SCHOOL REVIEW SCHOOLS PRIVATE AS WELL AS PUBLIC KEEP THEIR EYES STEADILY UPON THE GRADE OF COLLEGE FOR WHICH THEY FIT THE COLLEGES OF ANY GRADE CALL CHANGE THE EMPHASIS OF THEIR FITTING SCHOOLS FROM GREEK TO THE SCIENCES OR FROM TEXTBOOK STUDY TO LABORATORY PRACTICE AT WILL NO SUPERVISION CAN DO WHAT THEY DO SO EASILY REGARDING THE VARIETY QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF WORK SHARPSHOOTERS CAN NEVER BE SUPERVISED THEIR SUCCESS IS IN THE RELIABILITY OF THEIR AIM FITTING SCHOOLS ARE SHARPSHOOTERS SOME AIM AT HARVARD AND YALE OTHERS AT AMHERST AND WILLIAMS OTHERS AT TUFTS AND COLBY AND THEY HIT THEIR MARK THEIR NEED IS AN EYE TRAINED TO HOLD THE MARK STEADILY UNDIVERTED BY UNDUE SUPERVISORY INTER FERENCE THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MAY BE TOO INTENT UPON PREPARING THE FEW FOR COLLEGE EXAMINATIONS AND THE PRIVATE SCHOOL MAY BE TOO THOUGHTFUL OF THE MANY WHO WILL NOT TAKE THE EXAMINATION BUT SUPERVISION WOULD HARDLY CHANGE THE CONDITIONS THE ONLY APPRECIABLE AID THE SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE HAD HAS COME FROM ASSOCIATIONS AND CONFERENCES AND THESE ARE AS OPEN TO PRIVATE AS PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS THERE ARE NOT ONLY SERIOUS OBSTACLES TO THE SUPERVISION OF PRIVATE FITTING SCHOOLS BUT THERE IS NO APPRECIA BLE ADVANTAGE TO BE GAINED THEREFROM A E WINSHIP BOSTON AUG 28 2893 IN ALL GREAT REFORMS THE MAN WHO RAISES ISSUES DOES A WORK AL MOST AS IMPORTANT AS THE MAN WHO MEETS THEM DR MACKENZIES ARTICLE IN THE SEPTEMBER NUMBER OF THE SCHOOL REVIEW IS NOT UNLIKELY THEREFORE TO BE EPOCHMAKING WHO BEFORE HIM HAD EVER BROUGHT THE QUESTION OF THE SUPERVISION OF PRIVATE SCHOOLS INTO VITAL RELATION WITH THE HIGHEST INTERESTS OF  NEARLY HALF A MILLION BOYS AND GIRLS MANY OF WHOM ARE TO SWELL THE IOOOOO ENROLLMENT OF THE FIVE HUNDRED AMERICAN COLLEGES WHATEVER MAY BE THOUGHT OF THE REMEDY PROPOSED BY DR MAC KENZIE FOR THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHICH DO SO LARGE A PART OF OUR EDUCATIONAL WORK THERE CAN BE NO DIFFERENCE OF OPINION IN REGARD TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THE END OR THE URGENCY OF THE DEMAND IT MAKES UPON US IN REREADING DR MACKENZIES ARTICLE IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMMENTS MADE UPON IT BY THE DISTINGUISHED EDUCATORS WHO DIS 564ON SUPERVISING PTIVATE SCHOOLS CUSS IT IN THE PRESENT ISSUE OF THE REVIEW I AM STRUCK WITH THE LARGE MEASURE OF AGREEMENT THAT MAY BE FOUND IN ALL THE VIEWS PRESENTED WITH ONE EXCEPTION ONLY ALL THE WRITERS CONCUR IN THE VALUE OF SUPERVISION FOR PRIVATE SECONDARY SCHOOLS MR WIN SHIP DISSENTS HOLDING THAT  SUPERVISION HAS DONE LITTLE FOR PUBLIC SECONDARY SCHOOLS BUT THE EDUCATIONAL HISTORY OF OUR OWN STATES EVEN IF WE IGNORE THE STILL STRONGER EVIDENCE TO BE DERIVED FROM ENGLISH FRENCH AND GERMAN EXPERIENCE SEEMS TO THROW CONSIDERABLE DOUBT UPON THAT PROPOSITION IN SOME CITIES AND PERHAPS IN SOME STATES THE WORK OF SUPERVISION MAY HAVE FALLEN INTO INCOMPETENT HANDS BUT THIS MISHAP IS NOT SO GENERAL AS TO FOR BID OUR REGARDING IT AS AN ACCIDENT IN THE OPERATION OF A SYSTEM WHICH INHERENTLY CONSIDERED MUST BE PRONOUNCED GOOD SUPER VISION QUICKENS THE TEACHERS SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY SUPERVISION PROPAGATES IMPROVED AND ERADICATES DEFECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF EDU CATION AND MODES OF INSTRUCTION SUPERVISION GIVES TO ALL PUPILS THE BENEFITS WHICH WOULD OTHERWISE BE THE MONOPOLY OF THE FEW IT IS AS BENEFICIAL TO THE PRIVATE AS TO THE PUBLIC SCHOOL MR WINSHIP THINKS THAT IN FITTING SCHOOLS THERE IS NO PLACE FOR SUPER VISION THEY IMPROVE BY FOLLOWING IN THE WAKE OF THE COLLEGE TO WHICH THEY SEND PUPILS WOULD HE HOWEVER NOT ADMIT THAT THE FITTING SCHOOLS MIGHT BE GREATLY BENEFITED BY THE VISITATION SAY OF A SUPERVISORY COMMITTEE OF COLLEGE PROFESSORS WHO SHOULD MAKE SUGGESTIONS REGARDING THE TEACHING OF THEIR RESPECTIVE SPE CIALTIES  IT MAY BE WELL FOR THE FITTING SCHOOLS TO  KEEP THEIR EYES STEADILY UPON THE GRADE OF COLLEGE FOR WHICH THEY FIT BUT WOULD NOT THE UTTERANCES OF THE MEN WHO COMPOSE THE COLLEGE FACULTY BE BETTER THAN THE VISUAL IMAGE OF THE CURRICULUM THEY LAY OUT  IN OTHER WORDS MR WINSHIP SEEMS TO ME TO OBJECT NOT TO EVERY SORT OF SUPERVISION BUT ONLY TO INCOMPETENT AND THEREFORE HURTFUL SUPERVISION SUCH SUPERVISION AS THAT JUST SUGGESTED IS NOW PRACTISED IN MANY STATES WEST OF NEW YORK THE PRIMARY OBJECT IS TO HAVE THE SCHOOLS ACCREDITED SO THAT THEIR GRADUATES MAY WITHOUT FURTHER EXAMINATION ENTER THE STATE UNIVERSITY FROM MICHIGAN TO CALIFORNIA THIS SYSTEM HAS COMMENDED ITSELF IN THE LIGHT OF EX PERIENCE WHY SHOULD IT NOT BE ADOPTED IN THE EAST  IT WOULD BE A GREAT GAIN BOTH FOR COLLEGES AND FITTING SCHOOLS IF BY THE SAME ACT WE SHOULD GAIN BOTH A SYSTEM OF SUPERVISION AND A SUB STITUTION OF THE PRINCIPALS CERTIFICATE FOR THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE 565THE SCHOOL REVIEW EXAMINATION THE PROBLEM IS HARDER TO SOLVE IN THE EAST BECAUSE THERE IS NOT IN EACH STATE MERELY ONE UNIVERSITY WITH WHICH THE SCHOOLS HAVE TO DEAL BUT EVEN IN THE EAST THE CASE IS NOT HOPELESS AND PRINCIPAL ABERCROMBIE WHO IS NOT UNNATUR ALLY JEALOUS OF STATE INTERFERENCE WITH PRIVATE SCHOOLS POINTS OUT THE PATH OF PROMISE WHEN HE SAYS THAT  SUPERVISORY POWER SHOULD BE EXERCISED OVER ALL PREPARATORY SCHOOLS WHETHER PUBLIC OR PRI VATE BY A COMMISSION APPOINTED BY THE FACULTIES OF COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES CUSTOM PRECEDES LAW THE PILOTAGE SYSTEM OF NEW YORK AS DR MACKENZIE HAS SHOWN IS DUE TO THE ADOPTION AND LEGALIZING BY THE LEGISLATURE OF A PLAN OF SERVICE INITIATED AND MAINTAINED BY THE VOLUNTARY COOPERATION OF MERCHANTS AND UNDERWRITERS IF THE WORK OF SUPERVISION ABOVE OUTLINED SHOULD EVER COME INTO GENERAL PRACTICE IT WOULD BE AN EASY MATTER WERE IT THOUGHT AD VISABLE THEREAFTER TO HAVE IT EMBODIED IN MANDATORY LAW EVEN DR MACKENZIE COULD NOT OBJECT TO BEGINNING WITH VOLUNTARY SU PERVISION CHANCELLOR UPSON HAS DESCRIBED BRIEFLY AND CLEARLY HOW SUPERVISION IS CARRIED ON IN NEW YORK AND SHOWN THE CAPACITY OF THE SYSTEM FOR INDEFINITE EXPANSION BUT THE REGENTS OF NEW YORK ARE A UNIQUE BODY AND THOUGH THEY DO WELL THE WORK FOR NEW YORK IT DOES NOT SEEM PROBABLE THAT SIMILAR ORGANIZA TIONS WILL BE ESTABLISHED IN OTHER STATES I MEAN THAT THERE ARE NO GERMS NOW IN EXISTENCE OUT OF WHICH SUCH AN ORGANIZATION IN ANOTHER STATE MIGHT NATURALLY GROW VOLUNTARY SUPERVISION LEADING TO THE SUBSTITUTION OF THE SCHOOL CERTIFICATE FOR THE COLLEGE ENTRANCE EXAMINATION SEEMS TO ME AT ONCE THE EASIEST AND WITH DUE REGARD TO EXISTING PRACTICE THE MOST NATURAL SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM J G SCHURMAN 566

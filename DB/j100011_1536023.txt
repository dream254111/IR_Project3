open question whether external factors have any influence on the determination of sex Much of the experimental work that has seemed to show that sex can be influenced by nu trition temperature etc has either been carried out with too small a number of individuals or the methods used in the experi ments have been too crude to give results that could be consid ered as decisive It is seemingly quite within the power of the modern investigator to determine definitely whether sex can be influenced by external factors and careful work such as that which has been done by Cuenot and Hertwig should settle this question for all time If it is found that external factors do in fluence sex then the current chromosomesex theory will have to be abandoned or considerably modified if on the other hand it is shown convincingly that external factors have no influence on sex determination then the way is cleared for the theory that best explains the facts known to us and offers the most favorable hypothesis for future investigations along this line Several years ago I started a series of experiments on the eggs of the common American toad Bufo lentiginosus in order to study the problem of sexdetermination in this amphibian which seems to furnish peculiarly favorable material for an investigation of this kind In the first experiments that were made the influ ence of nutrition on the determination of sex was investigated The results of this work as shown in a previous paper King o7 seem to indicate that neither the quantity nor the quality of the food given the larvae has any influence on sex The present paper records the results of the second series of experiments that 27 Vol XVI No 2HELEN DEAN KING was made to study the determination of sex in Bufo The work was carried on in the vivarium of the University of Pennsylvania where the splendid facilities at my command permitted the use of relatively large numbers of individuals in each experiment and the rearing of them under exceptionally favorable conditions In all of the experiments in this series the tadpoles were kept in large glass aquaria or in cement tanks which were supplied with running water Each tank contained a sloping bank of sand and gravel and also a quantity of water plants With the exception of the one experiment in which the influence of starva tion on the determination of sex was being studied all of the tadpoles used in these investigations received similar food viz water plants and minute organisms in abundance and occasionally fine pieces of cooked meat or cereal According to my observa tions tadpoles of Bufo invariably prefer an animal to a vegetable diet and they readily devour the dead bodies of their companions To this latter fact can be attributed the loss of many individuals dur ing the course of these experiments Since there is no apparent relation between mortality and sex among tadpoles reared under artificial conditions as shown by the investigations of Pfliiger 82 and also by my former work the individuals in which sex was not ascertained are disregarded in considering the results of these experiments although the total number of individuals with which each experiment started is given in most cases The methods used in ascertaining the sex of the individuals were similar to those previously employed King 07 Whenever possible the bodies of tadpoles that died were preserved and the sex ascer tained by means of sections As there is considerable individual variation in the size and also in the development of the gonads even after the metamorphosis of the toads it was necessary to section the genital organs of nearly one fourth of the total num ber of individuals in order to ascertain their sex I EXPERIMENTS TO DETERMINE THE SEX RATIO OF THE INDI VIDUALS THAT DEVELOP FROM THE EGGS OF THE RIGHT OVARY AND OF THOSE FROM THE LEFT OVARY If sex is determined in the ovary as many investigators be lieve it is possible that the individuals developing from the eggs 28STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS of one ovary may show a very different sex ratio from that of the individuals produced from the eggs of the other ovary or it may be that the eggs of one ovary produce only females and those of the other ovary only males The following experiments were made to determine this point for Bufo On April 26 I907 a female which had just begun to deposit her eggs was killed by pithing The eggs in the right uterus were separated from those in the left uterus and each set was artifically fertilized sperm from the same male being used for both lots Six hundred eggs from each ovary were taken for the purposes of the experiment and placed in tanks of equal size During the course of their development all of the tadpoles were subjected to similar con ditions of temperature and they received similar food The sex of the first 300 individuals in each set to undergo metamorphosis was ascertained with the result shown in the following table TABLE I Total Sex Males Females Per Cent of Ascertained Females Right Ovary 300 131 169 5633 Left Ovary  300 128 172 5733 Total 600 259 341 5683 As shown in the above summary both lots of individuals gave approximately the same sex ratio 5633 per cent of the indi viduals from the right ovary and 5733 per cent of those from the left ovary being females This proportion of females is some what higher than that obtained in the majority of the experiments and seems to indicate that there is considerable normal variation in the sex ratio of lots of eggs laid by different females The above experiment was repeated with the eggs of another toad in the spring of I908 Owing to an accident however all of the tadpoles developing from the eggs of the left ovary were killed and in only 140 of the individuals that had developed from the eggs of the right ovary was sex ascertained Of this number 64 individuals were males and 76 or 542 per cent were females From the results obtained in these two experiments it is evident that the sex ratio of the individuals produced from the eggs of the right ovary is not materially different from that of the indi 29HELEN DEAN KING viduals which come from the eggs of the left ovary Whatever the factors may be which normally determine sex in Bufo they appear to have a similar action on the eggs of both ovaries II THE INFLUENCE OF STARVATION ON SEXDE TERMINATION IN BUFO During the course of fny former experiments an attempt was made to ascertain whether a scarcity of food tends to produce a relatively greater number of males as several investigators have maintained The mortality among the young tadpoles was so great however that the experiment was abandoned for the time In the spring of I907 this experiment was repeated on a much larger scale Eight hundred eggs which had been laid and normally fertilized in the laboratory on the morning of March 30 were placed in a large tank containing only water and clean sand No food of any kind was given the tadpoles at first and as might be expected they began dying in great numbers about two weeks after hatching Until the beginning of May the only food that the larvae obtained was the dead bodies of their companions which were devoured before they could be removed The tadpoles that lived developed very slowly and in order to prevent all of them from dying they were given a small amount of meat on the second of May and once a week thereafter Of the 800 individuals with which the experiment started only 59 lived until their sex could be ascertained Of this number 24 were males and 35 or 5932 per cent were females This number of individuals is of course too small to be of much value for statistical purposes yet the re sults of the experiment as far as they go seem to indicate that scarcity of food has no influence whatever on sexdetermination in Bufo Since the only food that the tadpoles received was animal food it might be inferred from the rather large proportion of females that were obtained that nitrogenous food favors the pro duction of females as Yung 85 has maintained The excess of females does not seem to me sufficiently large however to war rant such a conclusion Moreover my previous experiments showed that in a total of 464 individuals that received an exclu sive meat diet only 246 or 5301 per cent were females thus making it highly improbable that nitrogenous food has any in fluence on the determination of sex in Bufo 30STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS III THE INFLUENCE OF THE RIPENESS OF THE EGG AT THE TIME OF FERTILIZATION ON SEXDETERMINATION IN BUFO For several years past Hertwig 0507 has been investigat ing the problem of sexdetermination principally in various species of Rana and he has already published three contributions to the literature on this subject In his first paper which appeared in I905 Hertwig 05 suggests that the sexual character of an egg changes during the course of its development in the ovary In the early stages of its ripening the egg tends to produce a male in the middle phase of its ripening its tendency is towards the production of a female and in later phases when the egg is overripe it again shows a tendency to develop into a male This change in the sexual character of the egg Hertwig ascribes in his second paper 06 to einetn verschiedenen Wechselverhaltnis ihrer Hauptbestandteile der Kernsubstanz und des Protoplasma    Eier welche rela tiv armer an Kernsubstanz sind Weibchen liefern chromatin reichere dagegen Mannchen In his latest communication Hert wig 07 lays little emphasis on the second part of his theory but he seems to consider that the results of his experiments war rant the conclusion that the ripeness of an egg at the moment of its fertilization determines its sex In explaining the results of a certain set of experiments in which the eggs of a female from one locality were fertilized with sperm from a male taken from a different locality Hertwig further modifies his theory by the sug gestion that in some cases the spermatozoon exerts a definite in fluence on sexdetermination although as a rule it is probable that  die Eier zur Zeit der Befruchtung sexuell in so hohem Grad determiniert sind das der relativ geringe Einfluss des Samens gar nicht zur Geltung kommen wiirde Morgan 08 has recently given a brief review of this work of Hertwigs on sexdetermination and also a criticism of the results He states that  Hertwigs attempt to connect his view with the ratio of nucleus to cellplasm of the egg at different periods of its maturation can hardly be looked upon favorably since in the frogs egg the nucleus as such has already disappeared when the egg leaves the ovary The chromosomes are thereafter arranged on the equatorial plate of the first polar spindle It is however 31HELEN DEAN KING during this period that the degree of ripening is supposed to de termine the sex of the egg Morgan suggests that the results of Hertwigs later experiments seem to show that the male is responsible for sexdetermination The preponderance of one sex over the other would be explicable on the assumption that more sperm of one kind if two kinds exist are injured or that internal processes may lead to the production of more functional sperm of one sex It is unfortunate for this suggestion of Mor gans that the numerous investigations which have been made of the spermatogenesis of various species of amphibians have so far failed to show the slightest evidence of a dimorphism in the spermatozoa The frog offers much more favorable material than the toad for an investigation of the influence of the ripeness of the egg at the time of fertilization on sexdetermination since it is possible to extend the laying period of a frog over several days while the toad lays all of her eggs within a few hours whether she is sep arated from the male or not Two different experiments were made with the eggs of Bufo in order to study this problem In the first experiment a pair of toads were used that had been brought into the laboratory early in the morning of March 30 I907 The female commenced laying at I045 A M of the same day At I 115 A M the toads were disturbed and the eggs already laid Lot A were removed to a jar of fresh water The female began laying again at I205 P M and a second set of eggs Lot B were removed at 1225 P M The third laying Lot C began about I P M and was interrupted at 115 P M while the fourth and last lot of eggs Lot D were deposited be tween 215 P M and 3 P M The laying period for this female therefore extended over about four hours Four hun dred eggs were taken from each lot for the purposes of the ex periment each set of eggs being put in a compartment of a large aquarium The compartments were all approximately of the same size and each contained about the same amount of water and of plant food All of the I6oo individuals used in this ex periment were therefore subjected to similar external conditions during the period of their development There was no appreci able difference in the rate of growth of the tadpoles in the dif 32STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS 33 ferent compartments and the mortality was nearly the same in each lot The results of this experiment are summarized in the following table TABLE II Total Number Total Sex Males Females Per Cent of Individuals Ascertained Females Lot A 400 149 70 79 5302 Lot B  400 202 88 I 4 5643 Lot C 400 133 56 77 5789 Lot D  400 67 78 89 5329 Total 1600 651 292 359 55I4 The results of this experiment show a striking uniformity since in all four lots about the same proportion of the individuals in which sex was ascertained were females The excess of females was slightly greater in the two middle lots B and C than in Lots A and D This result would seem to support Hertwigs contention that eggs in the middle phase of ripening at the time of fertilization tend to produce a greater proportion of females The extreme lots of the series A and D did not however give a correspondingly greater proportion of males as the theory demands It is very probable therefore that the slightly greater proportion of females in the two middle lots has no especial significance The comparatively short interval between the laying of the eggs in Lot A and of those in Lot D makes no direct comparison possible between the re sults of this experiment and those of Hertwig on Rana since in some of Hertwigs experiments there was an interval of two or three days between the laying of the different lots of eggs by the same female Normally the eggs of the frog as well as those of the toad are all laid within a short period of time It would seem therefore as if in the above experiment a relatively greater number of males should have developed from the eggs of Lots A and D if as Hertwig believes the ripeness of an egg at the time of fertilization has any influence on its sex and if eggs ferti lized in early or in late phases of ripening have a tendency towards male production All of the eggs used in this experiment should have been peculiarly favorable for the production of males according to Hertwigs theory since owing to the very early spring in 1907HELEN DEAN KING the eggs were laid fully one week earlier than is the usual breed ing time for toads in eastern Pennsylvania Of the 65 I individ uals in which sex was ascertained 359 or 55I4 per cent were females This result does not accord with Hertwigs view that the younger the egg at the time of its fertilization the greater its tendency towards male production No eggs were obtained in the spring of I907 from the end of March until the last week in April when several pairs of toads were brought into the laboratory and a large number of eggs laid and normally fertilized Ac cording to Hertwigs theory these eggs were all overripe and should therefore have given a preponderance of males To this series belong the eggs used in the experiment described in sec tion I The results of the experiment in question which are summarized in Table I show that in the total of 600 individuals in which sex was ascertained there were 341 or 5683 per cent of females This is about the proportion of females that is ap parently normal for the species under natural conditions and this normal sex ratio does not seem to be altered whether the eggs are laid the latter part of March or retained by the female until the end of April The second experiment that was made to test the influence of the ripeness of the egg at the time of fertilization on sexdeter mination was carried out as follows  A female which was isolated on the afternoon of April 5 I908 began laying at 2 A M the following morning She was at once killed by pithing and the body unopened placed in a moist chamber At 9 A M seven hours later the eggs were removed from the body of the female and artificially fertilized sperm from two males being used Al though the eggs appeared perfectly good many of them did not fertilize and the segmentation of the fertilized eggs was slow and in many cases abnormal It is evident from this fact that post mortem changes had already begun in the eggs at the time that they were fertilized and that it would not be possible to obtain normal embryos from eggs of Bufo that remained unfertilized much longer than seven hours after the death of the female Al though the eggs in this series were placed under the most favor able conditions possible many of them failed to gastrulate and the tadpoles that lived developed very slowly large numbers of 34STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS them dying in the early stages of their development Of the thousand or more eggs with which the experiment started only 372 tadpoles lived until it was possible to ascertain their sex and in fully one half of this number the gonads had to be sectioned in order to make sure of the sex Of the 372 individuals in which sex was ascertained 178 were males and 194 or 52 5 per cent were females The sex ratio found in these individuals which developed from overripe eggs agrees essentially with that found among the individuals in the first experiment where presumably the eggs were in very early phases of ripening at the time that they were fertilized In both of these experiments an excess of females was produced although to accord with Hert wigs theory there should have been an excess of males in each case The results ot these experiments seem to indicate that in Bufo sex is not determined by the ripeness of the egg at the time that it is fertilized Eggs fertilized normally within a period of four hours or artificially seven hours after the death of the female eggs laid the last of March as well as those laid near the end of April all produce a slight excess of females and thus give a sex ratio that is practically the same as that found among young toads that have recently completed their metamorphosis under natural conditions In connection with these experiments reference may be made to a theory of sexdetermination recently elaborated by a physi cian Dr T E Reed 07 Starting with the supposition that the ovum is hermaphroditic and that sex which is a property or function of the ovum is determined at the time of the fertilization of the egg Reed then assumes that there is a sex cycle in the germplasm and that this rhythm extends over a period of twelve hours six being active or masculine and six passive or feminine and changes from day to day as do the tides The sex of the embryo is determined simply by the period through which the germ plasm happens to be passing when fertilization takes place According to this theory if an egg is fertilized during the positive period i e when the tide is rising the resultant embryo is always a male if fertilization takes place during the negative period when the tide is ebbing the embryo is neces 35HELEN DEAN KING sarily a female Reed gives no statistics regarding the working out of this hypothesis but he states that it holds good for a score or more of cases in man and a number of cases in the breeding of horses and cattle He does not explain however how the theory works in the case of such animals as dogs pigs rats etc which produce a number of offspring of both sexes at one birth It can hardly be supposed that the fertilization of the ova in all of these animals invariably takes place at the turn of the tide when according to this theory it might be possible for some of the ova to be fertilized during the positive male period and others during the negative female period An opportunity was offered to test this theory for Bufo with the lot of eggs used for the first experiment described in this section On March 30 1907 the tide was high at Philadelphia where the experiments were being carried on at 222 P M Ac cording to Reeds theory the six hours previous to this time woud form the positive period during which all eggs fertilized should develop into males Of the eggs used for the experiment in question Lots A B and C were laid and fertilized within the pos itive period and should therefore all have become males Lot D which was laid about the time of the turning of the tide might be supposed to produce some females This last lot as a matter of fact did not produce as great a proportion of females as did Lot B which was laid at the middle of the positive period and therefore according to Reed at the most favorable time for the production of males Results similar to these were obtained with another lot of eggs laid within the positive period Reeds hy pothesis therefore is not adequate to explain the determination of sex in Bufo however valuable it may prove to be as a theory of sexdetermination in some of the higher mammals IV THE INFLUENCE OF TEMPERATURE ON THE DETER MINATION OF SEX IN BUFO It has been held by several investigators that temperature has a decided influence on sexdetermination a high temperature favor ing the development of females a low temperature tending towards male production Most of the experiments which have seemed to give support to this hypothesis have been carried out with the 36STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS lower forms such as Daphnia and Hydatina The only experi ments which have seemed to show that temperature has an influ ence on sexdetermination in the vertebrates are those recently made by Hertwig on Rana In the first experiment which he made to study the influence of temperature on sexdetermination Hertwig divided a bunch of eggs of Rana temporaria into two lots one lot of eggs was allowed to develop at a temperature of 25 C the other lot de veloped at a temperature of 13 C The mortality among the tadpoles that were subjected to the higher temperature was exceed ingly great Out of a total of 200 individuals only 67 under went metamorphosis and of this number 4 were males and 63 females The individuals placed in the cold water lived much better that the others although the development of their genital organs was so greatly retarded that their sex could not be ascer tained even at the time of metamorphosis In a second series of experiments on the eggs of Rana esculenta Hertwig obtained the result shown in the following table TABLE III Water Temperature Males Females Per Cent of Females 2230 C 245 127 3413 I32I C 282 54 1607 Hertwig considers that the results of these two sets of experi ments indicate that a high temperature favors the development of females although he states that a number of individuals in which sex was ascertained is too small to give a decisive answer to the question In the second experiment the females formed but 3413 per cent of the individuals that had developed in the warm water and but I607 per cent of those that had been reared in the cold water As this experiment stands it hardly seems to me to offer any evidence in support of the view that a high temperature favors the development of females Both lots of eggs gave a large proportion of males and normally according to the investigations of von Griesheim 8  and of Pfliuger there appears to be an ex cess of females among both young and adult frogs It would be interesting to know under what conditions the eggs used in 37HELEN DEAN KING this second experiment were laid as this knowledge might help to explain the reason for the extraordinary excess of males Hertwig repeated this experiment in I906 using eggs of Razna temporaria None of the tadpoles developing at a temperature of 200 C lived to undergo metamorphosis and therefore their sex could not be ascertained Out of 340 larvae developing at a temperature of IO C 74 lived to undergo metamorphosis Of this number 38 were males 23 females and in 1 the sex was not ascertained although the individuals were probably males Hertwigs conclusion from this experiment is that cold favors the development of males as heat favors the development of females The following series of experiments was made to study the influence of temperature on the determination of sex in Bufo Five hundred eggs laid and normally fertilized in the laboratory on the morning of March 31 I907 were divided into two lots one lot of 250 eggs was placed in a greenhouse heated by steam where the temperature of the water in which the tadpoles were developing varied from 23300 C the remaining 250 eggs were placed in a tank in an unheated basement room where the temperature of the water in which the tadpoles lived ranged from I4I8 C during the daytime and was probably much colder at night Both lots of tadpoles were given similar food and all of the conditions excepting the temperature were made as nearly alike as possible For convenience in description this set of 500 eggs will be called Lot A An unusually high tempera ture has apparently as injurious an effect on the eggs of Bufo as it has on the eggs of Rana since a great many of the tadpoles that were kept in water with a temperature of 2330 C died before it was possible to ascertain their sex The tadpoles that lived developed very rapidly and many of them had completed their metamorphosis by the first of June The tadpoles kept in the cold water were vigorous and healthy and comparatively few of them died Their development was very slow however as compared with that of the individuals living in the warm water At the end of May the largest of the tadpoles in this lot had a body length of but 8 mm and their hind legs were still very small None of these tadpoles underwent metamorphosis until the third week in June 38STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS From a second lot of eggs laid in the laboratory on March 31 I907 another 500 eggs Lot B were taken and divided into two sets of 250 eggs each as in the previous experiment These eggs were placed under conditions similar to those of Lot A The tadpoles in this series behaved in all respects like those in the first series as regards their rate of development and time of metamorphosis The following table summarizes the results obtained with these two lots of eggs TABLE IV Water Temperature Number Sex Males Females Per ent of Ascertained Females Lot A4 22 C 63 I9 44 6984 Lot B J 22  39 30 9 2307 LotA 14 0 C 6 Lot A  8 C I69 68 IOI 6158 Lot B I I 117 73 44 3760 As shown in the above table the sex ratio of the individuals used in these experiments differs considerably from the sex ratio which is presumably normal for the species The individuals of Lot A whether they had lived in warm water or in cold water produced an unusually large proportion of females in the one case 6984 per cent in the other 6158 per cent of the individ uals in which sex was ascertained were females The most striking deviation from the apparent normal sex ratio is shown in the individuals of Lot B Here the number of females is only 23o7 per cent in the case of the tadpoles that had been reared in the warm water and 3760 per cent among the individuals that were subjected to a temperature of I4I8 C during the course of their development The results of these experiments fail to support Hertwigs contention that a high temperature acting during the course of the development of the tadpoles favors the production of females while a low temperature tends to produce a relatively greater proportion of males To be sure one set of eggs Lot A developing at high tempera ture gave 6984 per cent of females which is a considerably larger proportion of females than is found among young toads under natural conditions but another set of eggs Lot B de veloping under exactly similar conditions produced but 2307 per 39HELEN DEAN KING cent of females Just as striking a difference is shown in the case of the individuals that were reared in cold water Lot A produced 6158 per cent of females while Lot B developing under similar conditions gave but 3760 per cent of females The very different sex ratios obtained with lots of eggs subjected to the same temperature conditions seem to indicate that sex in Bufo is not determined by the temperature of the water in which the tadpoles develop If sex is already determined in the egg and not influenced by external factors there is probably a considerable variation in the sex ratios of lots of eggs laid by different females It might therefore be possible to explain the above results on the assump tion that by chance batches of eggs were taken for the experi ment which gave the extremes of possible normal variations in the sex ratio This explanation is hardly a satisfactory one especially in light of the results obtained in the experiment about to be described The batch of eggs from which the individuals used in Lot A were taken was laid in water which ranged from I6I8 C during the two hours or more in which the eggs were being deposited and fertilized The eggs used in Lot B on the other hand were laid in water which had a temperature of from I II3 C during the period of their deposition The results of the experiment at once suggested the idea that the tempera ture of the water at the time that the eggs were fertilized might possibly have some influence on sex a high temperature favoring the development of females a low temperature that of males The following experiment was made to determine the value of this suggestion On April 5 I908 a pair of toads were placed in water which remained at a temperature of about 26 C during the time that the eggs were being deposited and fertilized All of the eggs that were laid fertilized readily at this temperature and all seg mented in a normal manner For convenience in description this set of eggs will be called Lot C On the same date another pair of toads were placed in water which had a temperature of about 9 C during the period in which the eggs were being de posited All of the eggs in this set which will be called Lot D were also fertilized and all developed normally There was 40STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS therefore a difference of about 17 C in the temperature of the water in which these two sets of eggs were laid The eggs of each lot several thousand in number were put in a large cement tank supplied with running water and containing plenty of food The individuals in Lot C developed somewhat more rapidly than those in Lot D and they began their metamorphosis sooner The experiment had to be discontinued on July 7 although a number of individuals in each set had not yet reached a stage of development when it would be possible to ascertain their sex The results of the experiment tabulated according to the weeks when the individuals died or completed their metamorphosis is given in the following summary TABLE V Lot

warm water Of this number 1225 or 5624 per cent were females thus giving a sex ratio for Lot C that is little if any higher than that which is apparently normal for the species The results of this part of the experiment therefore do not seem to favor the suggestion that a high temperature acting on the eggs at the time of their fertilization tends to produce a relatively greater number of females There is the possibility however that this negative result may be due to the fact that in making the experi ment a higher temperature was used than that which is the optimum for the production of the greatest number of females and that many more females would have developed had the eggs been fertilized in water with a temperature but slightly higher than that used in the former experiment with Lot A 4IHELEN DEAN KING The sex ratio found among the individuals in Lot D agreeing with that of Lot B shows a considerable deviation from the sex ratio that is presumably normal for the species In a total of 2083 individuals which developed from eggs laid in water with a temperature of 9 C there were 902 or 4330 per cent of females Only once in the course of my investigations on sex determination in Bufo have I found the proportion of females in a lot of individuals anywhere near as low as that found in Lots B and D in the above experiments In studying the influence of nutrition on sexdetermination in Bufo I found that in a total of 349 individuals that had been fed on mixed animal and vege table food only 4584 per cent were females Other lots of eggs laid by the same females gave as high as 59 per cent of females however and on summarizing the results obtained in the entire series of experiments it was found that the females formed 5358 per cent of the total number of individuals in which sex was ascertained In the last experiment described there were 2127 or 4991 per cent of females among the 4261 individuals whose sex was ascertained This fact strongly suggests that the sex ratio in this lot of individuals was affected by the conditions under which the eggs were laid The results of the experiments described in this section indi cate although they by no means prove that the temperature of the water in which the eggs are fertilized has some influence on the determination of sex in Bufo A high temperature appears to favor the development of females a low temperature on the other hand seems to lead to the development of relatively more males It is possible as before suggested that the results ob tained in these experiments may be due to the fact that the sex ratio in Bufo is a variable one the proportion of females ranging from 3570 per cent in lots of eggs laid by different females If such is the case it surely is a strange coincidence that lots of eggs should have been taken for these temperature experiments which would give the greatest extremes in the sex ratio One serious objection that can be made to these experiments is that the eggs which were fertilized in warm water were laid by one female while the eggs fertilized in the cold water were laid by another individual This gives an opportunity for the results 42STUDIES ON SEXDETERMINATION IN AMPHIBIANS to be influenced by possible normal variations in the sex ratio in different lots of eggs The two sets of eggs were fertilized by sperm from different males also and there is the possibility as Morgan has suggested that the male is responsible for sexdeter mination in amphibians The last experiment was carried out in the manner described in order to obtain as large a number as possible of eggs that were fertilized normally at different tem peratures since it is not safe to draw conclusions from the results of experiments in which comparatively few individuals are used Another series of experiments will be made next spring which it is hoped will determine definitely whether temperature can influence sex in Bufo An account of the experiments already carried out is published in the hope that other investigators working in the same field may consider the suggestion here made as of sufficient value to warrant testing on any suitable material

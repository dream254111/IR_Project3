j100168,Harvard Law Review,1323222,A Repudiation of the Doctrine of Incorporation by Reference,i256919,A REPUDIATION OF THE DOCTRINE OF INCORPORATION BY REFERENCE  The doctrine is firmly established in England that an unattested document will be admitted to probate with a will if referred to in the will as an exist ing document and if actually in existence at the time of the execution of the will This rule rests on the fiction that the unattested document is incor porated into the will by the reference and is thus supported by the formali ties attending the execution of the will itself It was sought to invoke this doctrine in New York to avoid the strict interpretation there obtaining of a stattute similar to the English Wills Act requiring the signature of the testa tor to appear at the end of the will Because of the limited space in printed blanks wills had been drawn with some parts of the body of the will follow ing the signature of the testator and connected with the main part of the will by references Wills so drawn were not in conformity with the statute as interpreted by the New York courts which held that the statute referred to the physical literal end of the writing2 and not as the English courts tend to hold to the end of the sequence of meaning3 Such wills were held bad on the ground that the doctrine of incorporation byreference did not apply4 These decisions seem correct for the doctrine of incorporation by refer ence should and does apply only to documents that are not an integral part of the will In the cases mentioned the writing following the signature was a part of the will itself and it would seem incongruous to speak of incor porating it with that of which by the intention of the testator it was already a part According to the New York interpretation of the statute no part 1 Allen v Maddock II Moo P C 427 2 Matter of ONeil 9I N Y 516 Matter of Conway 124 N Y 455 8 Goods of Kimpton 3 Sw  Tr 427 4 Matter of Andrews I62 N Y I contra Bakers Appeal i0o7 Pa St 381NVO TES 529 of the will not even the part that preceded the signature would be admitted to probate though the part subsequent to the signature were abandoned5 The obvious reason is that the whole was a unit On the other hand refer ence to an extraneous document does not make it literally a part of the writing that refers to it even though it be physically annexed for it is only by a fiction that it is incorporated into the attested writing In such a case the signature at the end of the will proper is a sufficient compliance with the statute and this would seem to be true where the extraneous docu ment is physically annexed after the signature as well as where it is pllysi cally separated If the extraneous document is rejected because for instance the reference is too uncertain the will itself will properly be admitted to probate6 A recent decision of the Appellate Division of the Supremiie Court of New York however rejected the whole doctrine of incor poration by reference citing the abovementioned cases as authorities and failing to draw the distinction suggested In re Emmons Will 96 N Y Supp 506 This decision then must be considered an arbitrary repudia tion of the English rule previously accepted in New York 7 as well as in many other jurisdictions in this country8 and apparently rejected in none though questioned in Connecticut9 It is to be remarked however that the present case is supported by an unn6ticed New York decision10 to which there was no allusion in subsequient decisions containing dicta accept ing the doctrine of incorporation by reference 5 Matter of Hewitt 9I N Y 261 But the strictness of this rule has been relaxed in cases where the part subsequent to the signature is held immaterial Baker v Baker 51 Oh St 217 6 Wood v Sawyer 6i N C 251 7 Tonnele v Hall 4 N Y 140 cf Jackson v Babcock 12 Johns N Y 389 394 8 Skinner v American Bible Society 92 Wis 209 Newton v Seamans Friend Society 130 Mass 9i Fickle v Snepp 97 Ind 289 Gerrish v Gerrish 8 Ore 351  Pollock v Glassell 2 Gratt Va 439 468 Harvy v Chouteau I4 Mo 587 Beall v Cuniiingham 3 B Mon Ky 390 But cf Sharp v Wallace 83 Ky 584 See also Johntson v Clarkson 3 Rich Eq S C 305 Hunt z Evans 134 Ill 496 9 Phelps v Robbins 40 Conn 250 271  Bryans Appeal 77 Conn 240 10 Booth v Baptist Church 126 N Y 215 247 11 See Vogel v Lehritter 139 N Y 223

TIPLYING THE MASSES INTO THE VELOCITIES IN ANSWER TO SUCH WHO HAVE SOMETIME AGO AFFIRMD THAT THAT FORCE IS PROPORTIONABLE TO THE SQUARE OF THE VELO CITY AND TO THOSE WHO STILL DEFEND THE SAME OPINION BY THE REVEREND JOHN THEOPHILUS DESAGULIERS LL D FRS AS FAR AS I CAN LEARN MONIFIEUR LEIBNITZ WAS THE FIRST THAT OPPOSD THE RECEIVD OPINION CON CERNING THE QUANTITY OF THE FORCE OF MOVING BODIES BY SAYING THAT IT WAS TO BE ESTIMATED BY MULTIPLYING THE MASS OF THE BODIES NOT BY THEIR VELOCITY BUT BY THE SQUARE OF IT BUT INSTEAD OF SHEWING ANY PARA LOGISM IN THE MATHEMATICAL DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH U ARE270 ARE MADE USE OF TO PROVE THE PROPOSITION OR ANY MISTAKES IN THE REASONINGS FROM THE EXPERI MENTS MADE TO CONFIRM IT HE USES OTHER MEDIUMS TO PROVE HIS ASSERTIONS A AND WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO WHAT OTHERS HAD SAID ON THAT SUBJECT BRINGS NEW ARGU MENTS WHICH THE REVEREND AND LEARNED DR CLARK HAS FULLY ANSWERED IN HIS FIFTH LETTER TO HIM MES SIEURS JOHN BERNOULLI WOLFIUS HERMANNUSAND OTHERS HAVE FOLLOWD AND DEFENDED  LEIBNITZS OPI NION AND IN THE SAME MANNER SO THAT WHAT IS AN AN SWER TO HIM IS SO TO THEM POLENUS PROFESSOR AT PADUA HAS ACTED AFTER THE SAME MANNER IN THE EXPERIMENTAL WAY MAKING SOME EXPERIMENTS TO DEFEND MONSIEUR LEIBNITZS OPINION WITHOUT HAVING SHEWN THOSE TO BE FALSE WHICH ARE MADE USE OF TO PROVE THE CONTRARY AND NOW LATELY AN IN GENIOUS PROFESSOR ABORD WHO WAS OF THE OPINION COMMONLY RECEIVDAND IN HIS WRITINGS HAD DEMONSTRA TED IT IN THE USFUL WAY  CONFIRMING IT WITH THE COMMON EXPERIMENTS MADE IN THAT CASE HAPPENING TO MAKE SOME EXPERIMENTS LIKE THOSE OF POLENUS HAS DRAWN CONCLUSIONS FROM THEM TO SHEW THE FORCE OF MOVING BODIES TO BO PROPORTIONABLE TO THE SQUARE OF THEIR VE LOCITY AND BEING WHOLLY COME OVER TO THAT OPINION ENDEAVOURS TO DEDUCE IT FROM PHYSICAL PRINCIPLES AS THERE CAN HARDLY BE SAID ANY THING NEW OR BET TER THAN HAS BEEN SAID TO SHEW THE FORCE ABOVEMEN TIOND TO BE PROPORTIONABLE TO THE MASS MULTIPLIED IN TO THE VELOCITY I ONLY REPEAT HERE THE SUBSTANCE OF WHAT OTHERS HAVE SAIDAND MAKE SOME OLD EXPERI MENTS OVER AGAIN BUT THEN I CONSIDER SOME CIRCUM ACTE ERUDIT AD ANN 1686 P 162 POLENUS DE CASTELLIS P56 57C GRAVESANDE INTRODUCTIO VOL I NO 132 STANCE271 STANCES THAT PERHAPS HAVE BEEN OVERLOOKD AND AT LAST BY A NEW EXPERIMENT ENDEAVOUR TO SHEW WHAT HAS LED INTO AN ERROR SOME OF THOSE WHO DEFEND THE NEW OPINION IF A MAN WITH A CERTAIN FORCE CAN MOVE A WEIGHT OF FIFTY POUNDS THROUGH A SPACE OF FOUR FEET IN A DE TERMINATE TIME IT IS CERTAIN HE MUST EMPLOY TWICE THAT FORCE TO MOVE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS WEIGHT THROUGH THE SAME SPACE IN THE SAME TIME BUT IF HE USES BUT THE SAME FORCE HE WILL MOVE THE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS WEIGHT BUT TWO FEET IN THE SAME TIME FOR AS THE ONE HUNDRED POUNDS WEIGHT CONTAINS TWO FIFTY POUND WEIGHTS IF EACH OF THEM HAS TWO DEGREES OF VELOCITY GIVEN TO IT IT WILL EXACTLY REQUIRE THE SAME FORCE THAT WOULD GIVE ONE OF THEM FOUR DEGREES OF VE LOCITY HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE FORCE IS PROPOR TIONABLE TO THE MASS MULTIPLYD INTO THE VELOCITY E X P E R I M E N T I FIG 1 LET THE BALANCE A B WHOSE FULCHRUM OR CENTER OF MOTION IS AT C BE SO DIVIDED THAT THE BRA CHIUM A C BE BUT THE FOURTH PART OF THE BRACHIUM C B IT IS KNOWN TO ALL MECHANICIANS THAT A WEIGHT OF ONE HUNDRED POUNDS AT A WILL KEEP IN AEQUILIBRIO A WEIGHT OF TWENTY FIVE POUNDS HANGING AT B WHERE IT WILL HAVE A VELOCITY FOUR TIMES GREATER THAN THAT OF THE WEIGHT AT A FOR NOT ONLY WHEN THE BALANCE IS HORIZONTAL THERE WILL BE ANAEQUILIBRIUM BUT WHEN THE BALANCE IS PUT IN MOTION IT WILL RETURN TO AN AEQUILI BRIUM IN AN HORIZONTAL POSITION THE EQUAL AND CON TRARY FORCES APPLIED AT EACH DESTROYING ONE ANO THER WHEREAS IF THE FORCES WERE AS THE MASS MULTI PLYD INTO THE SQUARE OF THE VELOCITY THE TWENTY FIVE POUND WEIGHT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SUSPENDED AT D ONLY U 2 TWICE272 TWICE AS FAR FROM C AS THE WEIGHT AT A AND IN GENE RAL LET THE MAKE OF THE ENGINE BE WHAT IT WILL LET THE MECHANICAL POWERS BE COMBINED IN ANY MANNER WHEN TWO HEAVY BODIES BY MEANS OF A MACHINE ACT UPON ONE ANOTHER IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IF THEIR VELOCITIES ARE RECIPROCALLY AS THEIR MASSES THEY WILL DESTROY EACH OTHERS FORCES AND COME TO REST AS THIS IS TRUE IN RESPECT OF MECHANICAL POWERS SO IT IS IN RESPECT TO THE SHOCK OR BLOW GIVEN BY FALLING BODIES AN HEAVY BODY FALLING WITH AN ACCELERATED MOTION GOES THROUGH A SPACE OF ONE FOOT IN A QUARTER OF A SECOND AND ACQUIRES A VELOCITY WHICH WOULD CARRY IT TWO FOOT IN THE SAME TIME WITH AN UNIFORM MOTION THE SAME BODY FALLS THROUGH A SPACE OF FOUR FOOT IN HALF A SECOND AND ACQUIRES A VELOCITY THAT WOULD WITH AN UNIFORM MOTION CARRY IT EIGHT FOOT IN HALF A SECOND THEREFORE AS THE TIME OF THE FALL THROUGH A SPACE OF FOUR FOOT IS TWICE THE TIME OF A FALL THROUGH ONE FOOT THE VELOCITY IN THE LATTER CASE IS DOUBLE THAT OF THE FIRST AND CONSEQUENTLY THE BLOW THAT THE BODY WILL GIVE WILL BE DOUBLE E X P E R I M E N T II FIG II LET THE WEIGHT P OF ONE POUND BE PLACED IN THE SCALE SUSPENDED AT THE END A OF THE BALLANCE A B WHICH BEARS UPON THE GNOMON OR IRON SUPPORTER K H I THEN IF THE WEIGHT C BE LET FALL FROM D OR ONE FOOT IT WILL BY ITS STROKE ON THE END OF THE BEAM B RAISE UP THE OPPOSITE END A WITH THE WEIGHT P SO HIGH THAT THE SPRING G H WILL FLY FROM THE BUTTON I WHICH KEPT IT STREIGHT AND UPRIGHT BEFORE THE SHOCK IF THE WEIGHT P BE OF TWO POUNDS IT CANNOT BE RAISED BY THE FALL OF C FROM ANY HEIGHT LESS THAN F OR FOUR FOOT WHEREAS IF THE FORCE OF THE SHOCK WAS PROPORTIONABLE TO THE SPACE 2 WITHOUT273 WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO THE TIME AS MONSIEUR LEIBNITZ AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAVE AFFIRMED P OUGHT TO BE RAISED WHEN C FAILS ONLY FROM E OR TWO FOOT WHICH NEVER HAPPENS OR IF THE STROKE WAS PROPORTIONABLE TO THE MASS MULTIPLIED INTO THE SQUARE OF THE VELOCITY WHEN C FALLS FROM F THEN P MIGHT WEIGH FOUR POUND WHERE AS THE EXPERIMENT WILL NEVER SUCCEED UNDER THOSE CIR CUMSTANCES I KNOW IT IS OBJECTED THAT THE BLOW CANNOT BE AL WAYS DIRECT AND THAT THE STRING THAT GOES THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE FALLING WEIGHT TO GUIDE IT IN ITS FALL CAUSES A SENSIBLE FRICTION AND THEREFORE THAT SOMETHING OF THE FORCE IS THEREBY LOST BUT WE ARE TO OBSERVE THAT IF THAT WAS ALL THERE WOULD BE NO NEED OF RAISING UP C IN THE SECOND CASE QUITE UP TO F INSTEAD OF E WHEREAS IN FACT IT MUST ALWAYS BE RAISED BEYOND F TO ALLOW FOR THE FRICTION THAT HINDERS IT FROM PRODUCING A DOU BLE EFFECT IN FALLING FROM F FOR IF THE EXPERIMENT BE REPEATED AN HUNDRED TIMES THE WEIGHT P WHEN OF TWO POUNDS WILL NEVER BE RAISED BY LETTING C FALL FROM ANY PLACE BETWEEN E AND F E X P E R I M E N T III IF IN ORDER TO AVOID FRICTION INSTEAD OF A BLOW STRUCK UPON THE END B BY THE FALLING BODY THE SAID BODY C BE FASTNED TO A PRETTY LONG STRING TIED TO THE BUTTON M AS AT C AND FIRST LIFTED UP ONE FOOT AND THEN LET FALL SO THAT IN FALLING ONE FOOT IT MAY PULL DOWN B AND LIFT UP A WITH THE WEIGHT P OF ONE POUND WHENEVER P IS TWO POUNDS C MUST FALL FROM A HEIGHT GREATER THAN F OR FOUR FOOT OTHERWISE IT WILL NOT RAISE THE BRACHIUM A ESPECIALLY IF IT BE LET FALL BETWEEN E AND F E X P E274 E X P E R I M E N T IV I TOOK THE WEIGHT C OF SEVENTEEN OUNCES TROY WHICH WAS A ROUND BALL OF LEAD WITH A HOLE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF IT AND HAVING PASSED THE STRING NX THROUGH IT BEFORE IT WAS FASTENED TO THE HOOK X I PLACED THE WHOLE MACHINE IN SUCH MANNER THAT THE STRING BEING STRETCHED BY THE WEIGHT N WENT THROUGH THE HOLE OF THE WEIGHT C AND LIKEWISE THROUGH THE HOLE OF THE BRACHIUM B UPON WHICH C LAY WITHOUT TOUCHING THE SIDES OF THE HOLE EITHER IN THE WEIGHT OR BALLANCE THEN HAVING PUT SUCH A WEIGHT P IN THE OPPOSITE SCALE AS C FALLING FROM THE HEIGHT OF ONE INCH WAS ABLE TO RAISE HIGH ENOUGH TO LET LOOSE THE SPRING G H FROM THE BUTTON I I ADDED TO P ANOTHER WEIGHT EQUAL TO IT AND THEN LETTING FALL C ALONG THE STRING THAT GUIDED IT FROM AN HEIGHTH OF TWO INCHES THEN OF THREE AND THEN EXACTLY OF FOUR IT WOULD NOT RAISE THE DOUBLE WEIGHT P TO THE FORMER HEIGHT BUT FALLING FROM FIVE INCHES OR A LITTLE HIGHER IT RAISED IT UP E X P E R I M E N T V LEAVING EVERY THING AS IT WAS BEFORE I CHANGED THE WEIGHT C FOR ANOTHER LEADEN BALL OF TWICE THE WEIGHT WHICH FALLING FROM ONE INCH RAISED THE DOUBLE WEIGHT P TO THE USUAL HEIGHT THEN CHANGING THE WEIGHT P IN ANY PROPORTION WHATEVER HEIGHT WAS REQUIRD FOR THE HEAVIEST BALL C OR C 2 TO FALL FROM IN ORDER TO RAISE THE WEIGHT AT P MORE THAN FOUR TIMES THE HEIGHT WAS REQUIRED FOR THE FIRST BALL C TO RAISE THE SAME WEIGHT SO HIGH AS TO LET LOOSE THE SPRING E X P E275 E X P E R I M E N T VI I TRIED THE EXPERIMENT WITH THE WEIGHT C HANGING AT THE STRING M C AS IN EXPERIMENT III AND A FALL FROM AN HEIGHT OF FIVE OR NEAR FIVE INCHES WAS REQUIRED TO RAISE DOUBLE THE WEIGHT IN THE OPPOSITE SCALE THAT A FALL FROM ONE INCH WOULD RAISE ONLY HERE THE HEIGHTH ABOVE FOUR INCHES WAS NOT SO GREAT AS IN THE FORMER EXPERIMENT THE FRICTION BEING SOMETHING LESS THEN I SUSPENDED THE GREAT BALL C OR C 2 BY THE STRING M C AND WHEN BY FALLING ONE INCH IT RAISED THE WEIGHT P THE LITTLE WEIGHT C COULD NOT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT WITHOUT FALLING FROM A GREATER HEIGHT THAN FOUR INCHES IT IS HERE TO BE OBSERVED THAT WHICH WAY SOEVER THESE EXPERIMENTS ARE TRIED THE OBJECTIONS RISING FROM THE FRICTION DO NO WAY SERVE TO CONFIRM THE NEW OPI NION BECAUSE THEY SHEW THAT UPON ACCOUNT OF THE FRICTION THE HEIGHTS MUST BE SOMETHING MORE THAN IN A DUPLICATE PROPORTION OF THE VELOCITIES BUT NEVER LESS TO GIVE A BLOW WITH THE SAME BODY IN PROPORTION TO THE VELOCITY THAT THE MOMENTUM OF BODIES IS IN PROPORTION TO THE MASS MULTIPLIED INTO THE VELOCITY IS ALSO MOST EVIDENTLY SHEWN FROM THE CONGRESS OF ELASTIC BODIES AS HAS BEEN DEMONSTRATED BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON IN HIS PRINCIPIA IN THE COROLLARIES TO HIS LAWS OF MOTION I HAD OFTEN TRIED THE EXPERIMENTS THERE MENTIONED WITH BALLS OF IVORY AND BALLS OF GLASS AND SOME OF THEM WITH TWO BALLS OF STEEL OF TWO OUNCES EACH AND FOUND EVERY THING ANSWER ALLOWING FOR THE WANT OF PERFECT ELASTI CITY IN THE BODIES BUT NOW UPON THIS OCCASION AS THE OBJECTIONS TO THE RECEIVD OPINION WERE RE NEWED I WAS WILLING TO REPEAT THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE UTMOST ACCURACY AND THEREFORE AS IVORY BALLS ARE276 ARE NOT EQUALLY DENSE IN ALL THEIR PARTS AND GLASS BALLS BREAK AFTER TWO OR THREE STROKES I CAUSED BALLS TO BE NICELY TURNED OF STEEL AND MADE AS HARD AS THE WORK MEN CALL IT THAT IS AS ELASTICK AS POSSIBLE AND THE WEIGHTS OF THEM WERE PRECISELY AS FOLLOWS TWO BALLS OF TWELVE OUNCES TROY EACH ONE OF SIX OUN CES ONE OF THREE ONE OF TWO AND ONE OF EIGHTPEN NYWEIGHT THEN MAKING PENDULUMS OF THESE BALLS AND HANGING THEM UPON THE MACHINE CONTRIVED BY MARIOTTE FOR THE CONGRESS OF BODIES AND LATELY IM PROVED BY DR GRAVESANDE A I MEASURED 57 14 INCHES BETWEEN THE CENTER OF SUSPENSION AND THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE BALLS AND THEN EVERY DEGREE OF THE CIR CLE THEY DESCRIBED IN THEIR OSCILLATION WAS ONE INCH AND THE DEGREES BEING MARKED UPON A LINE OF CHORDS ON A BRASS RULER ABOVE THE BALLS BY THEIR STRINGS SUC CESSIVELY COVERING THE CROSS LINES OF DIVISION THE DEGREES THAT THE BALLS FELL FROM AND THOSE TO WHICH THEY ROSE WERE VERY DISCERNABLE TO AN EYE PLACED AT A CONVENIENT DISTANCE E X P E R I M E N T VII I TOOK THE TWO BALLS 12 AND REMOVING EACH FROM THE LOWEST POINT OF THEIR EQUAL AND RESPECTIVE CIRCLES UP TO 4 INCHES OR 4 DEGREES I LET THEM FALL SO THAT THEY MET AT BOTTOM AND WERE BOTH REFLECTED AGAIN TO 4 THE PLACE FROM WHENCE THEY FELL E X P E R I M E N T VIII EVERY THING ELSE BEING AS BEFORE INSTEAD OF ONE OF THE BALLS 12 I TOOK THE BALL 6 THEN LETTING 6 GO FROM  INTROD NO 170 VOL  8 DEGREES277 8 DEGREES AND 12 FROM 4 AFTER REFLECTION 12 WAS DRIVEN UP AGAIN TO 4 AS BEFORE E X P E R I M E N T IX THE BALL 3 FALLING FROM SIXTEEN DEGREES MET THE BALL 12 THAT FELL STILL FROM 4 AND AFTER REFLECTION 12 WENT UP AGAIN TO 4 E X P E R I M E N T X THE BALL 2 FALLING FROM  AND 12 FROM  12 WAS REFLECTED TO 1 AND WHEN 2 FELL FROM 12 DEGREES AND THE BALL 12 FROM 2 THE 12 WAS REFLECTED TO 2 E X P E R I M E N T XI THE BALL OF EIGHT PENNY WEIGHT WHICH WEIGHD BUT 130 OF THE BALL 12 FALLING FROM FIFTEEN INCHES OR DE GREES RAISD UP 12 THAT FELL FROM HALF A DEGREE TO THE SAME PLACE AGAIN IN ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS THE ERROR OR WANT OF PER FECT REFLECTION WAS GREATER IN THE LITTLE BALLS THAN IN THE GREAT ONES ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR GOING THRO A GREA TER ARC OF A CIRCLE WHEREBY THEY DEVIATED MORE FROM A CYCLOID THAN THE GREAT ONES AS LIKEWISE ON ACCOUNT OF THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR WHICH MUST BE GREATER BECAUSE OF THE LITTLE BALLS GOING THROUGH A GREATER ARC MOVING WITH MORE VELOCITY BEING SUS PENDED BY A STRING AS THICK AS THAT OF THE GREAT ONES AND HAVING MORE SURFACE IN PROPORTION TO THEIR WEIGHT BUT ALL THE ERRORS DO NOT BRING THE PHAENOMENA ANY THING NEAR WHAT THEY OUGHT TO BE IFTHE FORCE OF THE BO DIES WAS AS THE SQUARE OF THEIR VELOCITIES MULTIPLYD IN TO THEIR MASSES FOR THEN THE BALL 12 WOULD HAVE BEEN DRIVEN TO HEIGHTS VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT IT ROSE UP TO X X IN278 IN THE EIGHTH EXPERIMENT THE BALL 12 SHOULD HAVE RISEN TO NEAR FIVE INCHES AND THREE QUARTERS FOR THE BALL 6 FALLING WITH THE VELOCITY 8 MUST HAVE HAD ITS FORCE  8  8  6  384 AND THEN THAT THE BALL 12 MIGHT HAVE THE SAME FORCE OR QUANTITY OF MOTION IT MUST RISE NEAR TO 5 7 BECAUSE 57  57  12  38988 IN THE NINTH 12 SHOULD HAVE RISEN TO 8 FOR THE BALL 3 MUST HAVE HAD ITS FORCE  16  16  3  768 AND IF 12 RECEIVD ITS WHOLE FORCE IT MUST HAVE RISEN TO 8 BECAUSE 8  8  12  768 IN THE SECOND PART OF THE TENTH EXPERIMENT 12 SHOULD HAVE RISEN TO NEAR 5 BECAUSE 12  12  2  288 AND 5  5  12 IS BUT 300 IN THE ELEVENTH THE BALL 12 THIRTY TIMES HEAVIER THAN THE LITTLE ONE MUST HAVE GONE TO 2 34 INCHES BE CAUSE THE MOMENTUM OF THE LITTLE BALL BEING  15  15  1  225 THAT OF THE BALL 12 MUST BE  275  275  12  226 C IT MAY BE HERE ALLEDGD THAT ONE OUGHT TO SUBTRACT THE MOMENTUM WITH WHICH THE GREAT BALL COMES UPON THE LITTLE ONE BUT THAT WONT MEND THE MATTER MUCH THO INDEED THE DIFFERENCE WILL BE LESS FOR IN THE EIGHTH EXPERIMENT IF WE SUBTRACT 4  4  12  192 FROM 38988 THERE WILL REMAIN 19788 AND THE BALL 12 WILL GO BUT TO 4 BUT THEN IN EXPERIMENT 9 IF WE SUBTRACT THE SAME NO 192 FROM 768 WE SHALL HAVE 576 WHICH WOULD CARRY 12 TO NEAR SEVEN DEGREES BE CAUSE 7  7  12  588 IN THE TENTH EXPERIMENT THERE IS ONLY 48 TO BE SUB TRACTED AND IN THE ELEVENTH ONLY 15 AND THEREFORE THE VELOCITY OF 12 WILL VERY MUCH FALL SHORT OF WHAT IS AGREEABLE TO THE NEW OPINION AFTER THE EXPERIMENTS MADE AND WHAT HAS BEEN SAID TILL THESE CONSEQUENCES ARE OVERTHROWN NO NOTICE OUGHT TO BE TAKEN OF ANY OBJECTIONS OR NEW EXPERI MENTS279 MENTS BUT TO GIVE THE OBJECTORS ALL POSSIBLE SATISFA CTION I SHALL IN ANOTHER PAPER ENDEAVOUR TO SHEW THE FALLACIES OF THE ARGUMENTS AND SOLVE THE PHAENO MENA OF THE EXPERIMENTS MADE SHEWING BOTH BY REASON AND EXPERIMENT THAT THE FACTS OUGHT TO BE AS THEY ARE IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE RECEIVD OPINION AND LAWS OF RESISTANCE F I N I S

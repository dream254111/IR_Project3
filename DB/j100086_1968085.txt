j100086,Annals of Mathematics,1968085,On Linear Equations with an Infinite Number of Variables,i307131,ON LINEAR EQUATIONS WITH AN INFINITE NUMBER OF VARIABLES BY MAXIME B6CHER AND Louis BRAND E Schmidts treatment of a system of linear equations with an infinite number of variables is of such essential simplicity and importance that it seems destined to become classical The original memoir however owing to its condensation and to the rather abstract form which it has in parts is not entirely easy reading for the beginner and Kowalewskis presentationt while attractive in some respects is extremely long and so arranged that unless one reads the whole it is almost impossible to get at the essential results The following treatment which so far as it goes is complete in itself is a modification of those heretofore given Its characteristic features are on the one hand that it avoids altogether the process of normaliza tion which plays such an essential and often repeated rdle in the earlier treatments and on the other hand that it deals first with the case of a finite number of equations involving an infinite number of variables and regards the case of an infinite number of equations as a limit For the sake of clearness though this is not logically necessary the algebraic case of a finite number of variables is taken up first 1 Complex Quantities with k Components The real and complex quantities of ordinary algebra shall be termed scalars in distinction to the higher complex quantities a a2  ak which are aggregates of k scalars the components of the complex quantitytaken in a definite order Such complex quantities will be denoted by Greek letters That complex quantity whose components are all zero shall be denoted by 0 Two complex quantities a  a a2   ak i  b1 b2    bk are said to be equal when and only when a  b i  1 2    k We define the sum of a and B by a   a  bi a2  b2 ak  bk and the product of a by a scalar p by pa  ap a pal pa2  pak  Rendiconti

said to be linearly dependent if there exist n scalars cl c2   cn not all zero such that Cla1  C2a2      Cnan  0 In view of the definition of the complex quantity 0 this is equivalent to saying that al a2    a are linearly dependent when and only when the n sets of ic scalars each forming their components are linearly dependent Any k  1 complex quantities having k components are therefore linearly dependent When less than k complex quantities are given there are always others linearly independent of them We also consider the inner product or simply product of two complex quantities a and i3 defined to be the scalar a3  aib1  a2b2    akbk We note that aO3 may vanish when a  0 0  0 From this definition it is clear that the commutative and distributive laws ao3  a af  a  a  aw and the associative law in the case of multiplication by a scalar p p0a  pa3  ap3 all hold good The associative law in the case of the product of three or more complex quantities is not true Thus ofdy is meaningless unless either ay or aOy is specified A dash above a scalar shall denote as usual its conjugate imaginary scalar and we shall extend this notation by writing a f al I l I 2  a ik Then a  af By the norm of the complex quantity a is understood the scalar norm aos aa  aiad  a2a2   akak  I a 12  a2 12   i ak 12 which is always real Clearly norm a  norm a Norm a is 0 when and only when a  0

a1  ail a2  ask   1 2  n and also the xs as the components of the complex quantity t  X1 X2  eX Our system of equations may then be written 1 at 0 a24  01   nt  0 THEOREM 1 If t satisfies equations 1 and is linearly dependent upon al a2  I n then 0  0 For suppose that Cl C01  C2 a2 Cnatn Then multiplying equations 1 by cl 2  c respectively and adding we get Zial  C2a2   n   0 Hence t  0 as was to be proved COROLLARY If t satisfies the equations al14   aqz4  i   a n and is linearly dependent upon a a2   then t  0 We are now in position to obtain a criterion for the linear dependence of n complex quantities If a a2    an are linearly dependent Ciai  C2a2      Cnac  0 where not all the cs are zero Multiplying this relation in succession by a a2   njwe obtain the n equations ciai  c2a2 i  cnxni i 12  Cnn In this system of homogeneous linear equations in cl c2  cn the cs are not all zero and hence the determinant of the system must vanish We call this determinant which it should be noticed is a real scalar the Gramian of a a2  an and denote it by G a a2   an Thus alai ala2  are a2ai a2a2  a2an 2 G a a2 an n   anal anta2  anan The relation G  0 is therefore a necessary condition for linear dependence170 MiAXIME BOCHER AND LOUIS BRAND It is also sufficient For suppose that G  0 then the n sets of scalars forming the rows of the Gramian are linearly dependent and we have a iCl al C2a2   Cnatn  i  1 2  n where not all of the cs vanish We now infer from the Corollary of Theorem 1 that C1a1  C2a2    Cnan  0 which establishes the linear dependence of a a2  an We have thus proved THEOREM 2 A necessary and sufficient condition that the complex quantities a a2   an be linearly dependent is that their Gramian vanish We turn now to the solution of the system 1 assuming that these equations are linearly independent so that G a a2    an  0 Every complex quantity and therefore every solution tj of 1 can be written in the form 3 tl1  cial1  C22a2   Cnan  X7 where 77 is some complex quantity In order that this be a solution of 1 the scalars ci must satisfy the n relations r claiai  C2a1a2    cnaian  a77 4 C1n1an  C2axni2   cnan  n Solving these equations for the cs and substituting in 3 we have aiai alc2  aian at7 anX1 a02  a ann 5 41   Gal a2  a Every solution of 1 can therefore be expressed in this form That con versely no matter what the complex quantity X may be the expression 5 always gives a solution of 1 is seen at once by direct substitution for if we form the product ajtj by multiplying the last row of the determinant in the numerator by ai this row becomes identical with the ith row  We note in passing that al a2   C are connected by the same linear relation that connects the rows of their Gramian written as aboveLINEAR EQUATIONS WITH INFINITE NUMBER OF VARIABLES 171 THEOREM 3 If the equations ai2   a24    a nt  0Y are linearly independent their general solution is given by 5 where t is an arbitrary complex quantity When 4j vanishes we see from 3 that  is linearly dependent upon ar1 a2   aXn Conversely if  is linearly dependent upon y a2  C the same is true of 41 and hence by Theorem 1 0  0 Now to two s correspond two ls whose difference is precisely that solution of 1 which corresponds to the difference between the is Consequently two different 71s yield the same 4j when and only when their difference is linearly de pendent upon c24 a2   an If n  k the equations 1 are necessarily linearly dependent so that Theorem 3 does not apply to this case If n  k every 77 is linearly de pendent on the s so that in this case as is well known equations 1 have only the trivial solution zero If n  k we can find c  n complex quan tities Xnly an2 ak such that a X2  ak are linearly independent Then every q may be written as Cia1  C2a2  a  Ckk but as a change in  by a quantity linearly dependent upon a1 n does not affect formula 5 we lose nothing in generality if we assume 77 of the form 71  Cnl1el    Ckak Thus the solution 5 contains as it should c  n arbitrary scalars Cnb  Ck and contains them linearly and homogeneously A formula for the norm of 41 is readily found From 3 6 norm 4j  Ziaii    Znan6  l76  7lq6 If we form the product 771 from 5 by multiplying the last row of the deter minant in the numerator by q it is clear that G a1 a2   aens 77 7 norm 1  G a a2  an We proceed to use this relation to establish an important property of Gramians In 7 ai a2   anX rj maybe regarded as n 1 arbitrary com plex quantities we will assume that they are linearly independent Then X is clearly not a linear combination of n  so   so that 41  0 and norm 4  0 Moreover this assumption entails that none of al a2  Can  vanish and hence the Gramian of any one e g G a  a1ca1 is real and positive Hence by giving to n in 7 in succession the values 1 2   we establish by mathematical induction THEOREM 4 The Gramian of any number of linearly independent complex quantities is real and positive172 MAXIMIE BOCHER AND LOUIS BRAND 3 NonHomogeneous Linear Algebraic Equations We come now to the system of nonhomogeneous equations 8 ai  b1 a22  b2  ant  bn where we again assume that a a2   an are linearly independent and trv to find a solution of the form 9 to  C1l1  C2a2   Cnihn Substituting this in 8 we obtain n linear equations which may be obtained from equations 4 by replacing their right hand members by b1 b2   bn respectively These can as above be solved for the cs by Cramers rule and the results substituted in 9 This gives aia aia2  alinabl anal anca2  anan bn 10 lo i Ga 2 an That this is really a solution of 8 we see by direct substitution For if we form the product ajio the last row of the determinant in the numerator becomes att iai  ai2 a  ian  and when the ith row is subtracted from this it appears that a 4O  biGG  bi We have thus proved THEOREM 5 If a a2 I an are linearly independent the equations 8 have one and only one solution of the form 9 and this is given by 10 The general solution of 8 is of course obtained by adding to the par ticular solution 10 the general solution 5 of the homogeneous equations 1 it is therefore aiaal a9a2  aan aam bi anal anQ2  anan an77

Linear Equations in an Infinite Num ber of Variables We now consider a system of n equations 14 ai1x1  ai2x2    0 i 1 2   n where the number of unknowns x1 x2   is infinite For this purpose we use complex quantities with an infinite number of components If a a a2  is such a complex quantity we consider the series I a 12  I a2   A If this series is convergent we say that the complex quantity has a finite norm and define norm a a  a2 12  CalVnorm a  If not all of the bs vanish it is clear from equations 8 that 4o  0 and hence norm 4o  0 By means of 13 we may now prove at once the following THEOREM If the Gramian of linearly independent complex quantities is bordered by scalars that do not all vanish so as to form a determinant of the type of that in 13 this bordered Gramian is negative17 4 MAXIME BOCHER AND LOtIS BRAND The sum of a  a a2  and   bl b2  and the product of a by a scalar p are defined as a  a  bl ad  b2  pa ap9 pai pa2  The product a3 we define by the formula a3 aib1  a2b2  whenever this series converges When a and  have finite norms their product a always exists as then the series in question is absolutely con vergent For writing ak  al a2  a 1s Ok  I bi b2  bk  we have from Theorems 2 and 4 akak ak3k G ak Sk O Hence as ak ok andk 3k aok3k2  norm a  norm 3 or iaibil   lakbkl  IajI Since this holds for all values of k the absolute convergence of our series is established The distributive law a3  y  ao  aOy evidently holds when a3 and ay have meanings Thus in particular if a and  have finite norms we have norm a  a  3a  a  a  Oa  a3  3S so that if two complex quantities have finite norms their sum also has a finite norm It is also obviously true that if a complex quantity has a finite norm it will still have a finite norm after being multiplied by a scalar From these two facts we readily infer that if a number of complex quantities have finite norms any complex quantity linearly dependent upon them also has a finite norm LUsing the n  1 complex quantities a  aa ai2  i  1 2  n  XX2 y the equations 14 may be written 15 al O  O a2 O  0  2 ant   We place upon the coefficients ai the restriction that they have finite norms Then t is to be so determined that the series a ji all converge to the valueLINEAR EQUATIONS WITH INFINITE NUMBER OF VARIABLES 175 zero If t has a finite norm the series ait necessarily converge but this may also be the case when t has an infinite norm THEOREM 7 If t satisfies the equations 15 and is linearly dependent on a a2  I an then 0 The proof is exactly that of Theorem 1 We shall define the Gramian of a set of complex quantities of finite norm precisely as was done in  2 THEOREM 8 A necessary and sufficient condition that n complex quantities of finite norm be linearly dependent is that their Gramian vanish The proof is precisely that of Theorem 2 THEOREM 9 If equations 15 are linearly independent their general solu tion is given by formula 5 where X is any complex quantity such that the products al a2    71 all exist The proof is practically identical with that of Theorem 3 In order that the solution 4 have a finite norm it is necessary and sufficient as we see from 3d that 7 have a finite norm Here as in  2 it is clear that two 7s lead to the same solution 4j when and only when their difference is linearly dependent upon a a02   ant The requirement that i7 be so chosen that aA axti  ah all exist will be fulfilled when 77 has a finite norm It will however be fulfilled in many other cases For example denoting the components of as by ail ai2    if all the aiis are positive and aij constantly decreases and ap proaches zero with increasing j we may take for 77 the complex quantity 11  1y1   whose norm is infinite Whenever sl has a finite norm i e whenever this is true of 77 its norm is given by formula 7 As in 2 this formula may be now used to establish THEOREM 10 The Gramian of any number of linearly independent com plex quantities of finite norm is real and positive We now pass to the nonhomogeneous equations 16 air  b1 a24  b2 a a  bn the coefficients ai again being assumed to have finite norms THEOREM 11 If al a2 a are linearly independent the equations 16 have one and only one solution linearly dependent upon a a2 a  and this solution is given by formula 10 The proof is precisely that of Theorem 5 The solution in question is termed the principal solution The general solution of 16 is given by formula 11 where  is any complex quantity whose products with ai a2   en exist THEOREM 12 Among the solutions of 16 no other has so small a norm as the principal solution The principal solution being a linear combination of al OZ2 Ohnx176 MAXIME BOCHER AND LOUIS BRAND has a finite norm This is also true of the general solution t  4o  4i when and only when 2 has a finite norm From here on the proof is just like that of Theorem 6 The norm of 2o is given by formula 13 5 Some Theorems on the Limits of Complex Quantities We proceed to establish some properties which will be important for us of complex quantities with an infinite number of componentst If a and  have finite norms we have from Theorems 8 and 10 aa ao3 Ga  ia12a113 12la312 0 whence

Again if liMan  a lim13n  1 then 21 liman  1n  a  1 n00 for we have seen that when n  N a an and 1  A have finite norms and hence from 18 we have a a  3  an  13 l a  an  13  On I Furthermore ifan2 13n

Hence when m n  N  We say that a converges uniformly toward a when for every positive e there exists an N such that 20 is true It is clear from the above that strong convergence implies uniform con

strongly to a where an  al     an From Theorem 13 we see that a necessary and sufficient condition for the strong convergence of the above series is that after a certain point the terms of the series

quantities 4Iei be zero That this is a necessary condition is obvious To prove it sufficient assume 1ei  0 i  1 2   By Theorem 18 41nq  0 whenever 77 has only a finite number of components different from zero But by 45 every q of finite norm is the strong limit of such a set of 71s Consequently by Theorem 19 J77  0 for every tq of finite norm as was to be proved We have expressed the solutions 4j and 40 as well as their norms as the limit of the ratio of two determinants of order n  1 and n as n becomes infinite We proceed to inquire under what conditions the individual determinants and not merely their ratios converge In all cases the denominator determinant is Gai  an and if this Gramian converges as n becomes infinite the determinants in the numerators will likewise non verge Thus we have merely to consider the convergence of Gal  an as n becomes infinite or as we phrase it the convergence of the infinite Gramian Ga a2     THEOREM 21 A sufficient condition for the convergence of the infinite Gramian of the complex quantities al a2  which have finite norms is that the infinite product f ai 12 diverge to zero or converge Consider the set of complex quantities as  ai a i whose norms are all unity We have then n 46 GaiY an  GOi1  n aI ai2 Now GO  An  O n 12G31 Xn 3n11   dn1i3n1 1n1i3n O lnli   1343n1 0 The first term on the right is a bordered Gramian of the form of the

diverges to zero or converges we have from 46 that Ga Qa2   converges as we wished to prove COROLLARY 1 If Gf1 02    0 the condition that IlM a1 Hi 2 diverge to zero or converge is also necessary for

Theorem 21 we now see that the determinants occurring in the expressions for 4 and ton and for their norms will converge as n  X if at the start the equations 27 and 37 respectively are divided through by scalars so as to make the norms of all the as  1 If when this is done Gal a2   0 the formulae for 4 and 0o furnish solutions for these infinite systems of equations in terms of infinite

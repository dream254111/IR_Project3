j100010,The American Historical Review,1833747,Minor Notices,i304858,Mr Brooks Adams relates in the preface to his Law of Civilization and Decay New York Macmillan and Co 1895 pp x 302 that his Emancipation of Massachusetts led him to study more thoroughly certain aspects of the Reformation and that these studies led him still farther back into a more general study of history until there gradually shaped itself in his mind the theory of history which he has presented in this volume To the reader of the book who judges it from the standpoint of the special student of the facts of history it seems a marked example of the influence which consciously or unconsciously the socalled fall of Rome usually exerts upon the thinking of men in regard to the course of history For him the book strongly emphasizes the conclusion to which many considera tions must have led him that one of the things most imperatively demanded before any very complete work can be done upon the general course of history is the minute study of the fall of Rome by some one who is not merely a thoroughly trained historical critic but who is a thoroughly trained economist as well The author considers the course of history to be a regular alternation between one stage in which society is loosely organized controlled by fear as the active cause and of a military and imaginative type and another in which society is highly centralized controlled by greed and of an economic type The first changes into the second through the accumulation of capi tal and the second changes back into the first through the extinction of the productive power under a capitalistic organization Rome gained its empire by the strength of its military class but at once began the develop ment of a capitalistic class which became so powerful as to control the state and finally to destroy the producing class This left Rome defence less and the Germans easily entered and introduced a new age in which the imagination again became the controlling force Thus was produced the theocracy of Gregory VII and the Crusades But the Crusades brought the West into contact with the two highest civilizations of the time the Eastern Empire in the final stages of centralization and the Arabs at the meridian of their material splendor  and this contact introduced an age of economic competition in Europe Gradually a struggle came on between the imagination represented by the priests and the new economic force in which the money power gained a complete victory This victory is the Reformation which put the state under the control of the capitalistic class as in Rome Since then there has been a steadily increasing centralization of society and a more and more powerful capitalistic organization which has reached its highest point in the present century Now all signs point to the fact that we are approaching a second change back into another military and imaginative age The book is very suggestive it presents a theory of history which mustliJinor Notices 569 be reckoned with and it is remarkable for the skill with which the facts are selected Its chief defects are a somewhat uncritical use of authorities a failure to make the bearing of all the details upon the main line of the thought perfectly clear and its decidedly onesided treatment of a very complex development A Manual of Greek Antiquities by Percy Gardner Lincoln and Merton Professor of Classical Archxeology at Oxford and Frank Byron Jevons classical tutor in the University of Durham New York Charles Scribners Sons 1895 pp Xii 736 aims  to compress into a single volume an introduction to all the main branches of Hellenic antiquities  social religious and political It does not supplant the Dictionary of Aintiqui ties nor the larger German handbooks but it gives a connected accoulnt of the outlines of the subject Often it does more It is moreover exceed ingly interesting frequently there is a sense of personal contact with the

illustrations are judicious and helpful Mr WV H Bucklers Origijn and History of Contract in Roman Law dozon to time End of tihe Republican Period the Yorke Prize Essay for I893 Cambridge University Press I895 pp Vii 228 is devoted exclusively to the historical development of the different forms of contract at Rome up to the beginning of the empire and accordingly the main object is the ascertain ing the origin of each form and the fixing the period in which it attained legal significance The author is familiar with the best modern authorities and has summed up clearly and in convenient form many of the accepted opin ions He has also taken occasion to state his own opinions in refutation of many hitherto held but is not convincing in his theorizing The regal period and that of the XII Tables naturally afford the best opportunity for570 Reviews of Books the expression of novel views Of this he takes advantage in the regal period in connection with the origin of sponsio the nature of nexu m etc and concludes the chapter by criticising the statement  that the earliest known contracts were couched in a particular form of words In the period of the XII Tables one may notice particularly his distinction between nuncupatio and dictum his novel view as to the origin of vadinmoniium and the actio ex causa depositi He curiously seems to regard the XII Tables as mainly the creation of new law In treating of the contracts of the later republic Mr Buckler deals first with the formal ones then with those of the js genziunm and lastly with certain contracts not classified as such by the jurists In the first which affords most opportunity for original speculation he is least successful In the second he finds the origin of empto in the necessary sales and pur chases by the state and a similar origin of locaio All other contractual relations of this period arose later under the edict Pacla conventa and were protected at first by an acio in facum and only later in most cases by an actio in jus It may be questioned whether too much importance has not been attributed in fixing the dates of the legal recognition of the several contracts to the allusions to or silence concerning the same on the part of nonlegal writers such as Cicero and Plautus Still where authorities are scant the most must be made of those existing and the author has cer tainly been guided by this maxim in treating of this subject full of vexed questions Bishop Westcott of Durham has gathered into a little volume certain Historzcai Essays by his predecessor the late Bishop Lightfoot London and New York Macmillan pp Xiii 245 The essays are so various as to give a quite miscellaneous character to the volume The three essays on Christian life in the second and third centuries were read as lectures in St Pauls Cathedral and have a homiletic tone The rehearsal of heroic days was to kindle resolve and ennoble thought At the same time a scientific purpose chose the period intervening between the supernatural assistance of apostolic inspiration and the secular assistance of alliance with the state to explain the success of Christianity by the vital energy of its own ideas The facts are all familiar and the interest lies in the authors evaluation of them and in the solid merits of his style A stronger and more adequate exposition of the thesis was perhaps prevented by the restraints of ecclesiasticism That Christianity won by satisfying the best moral and religious insights of men is an argument only weakened by lean ing to Augustines unhistorical view that Christianity was the only life in a decrepit and dying world The second and third essays dealing with the motives of persecution and the superiority of Christian worship contain just appreciations but the first on the moral transformation of society is most unsatisfactory The illustrations are the least telling The absence of infanticide among Christians is unfortunately made an indictment of the moral standards of paganism Surely many pagan protests could have beenMinor Notices 571 quoted and the more perfect correspondence of precept and conduct in the Church is linked with the fact that a religion exposed to persecution attracts only the most earnestly moral elements of society Another instance opposition to the institution of slavery is purely imaginary Christian ideas can be used in behalf of emancipation but they were not It is not true that the Church fearlessly carried this principle of the equiality of all men in Christ and the institution of slavery was more en dangered by Ulpians dictum jure naturali omnes liberi nascuntur    quod ad jus naturale attinet omnes homines xquales sunt than by an assertion of religious equality before God Had Lightfoot indulged in quotations only two were possible the Apostolic Constitutions IV 9 which probably means the redemption of Christians who have been reduced to slavery under pagan masters and Ignatius to Polycarp IV which vetoes a wish for emancipation That Pius bishop of Rome had a slave brother is far from certain and the originial servitude of Callistus proves nothing for Church liberality we only know it as told to his discredit by Hippolytus Yet granting the case the Church did not keep to this standard Jerome and the bishop of Jerusalem taunt each other with the ordination of slaves and Leo I Ep IV describes such ordination as a pollution of the sacred ministry and an infringement of the rights of masters Of the remaining essays the longest consists of two lectures delivered at Edinburgh on England during the latter half of the thirteenth century The first deals with the political and constitutional history of the period the second with the history of architecture and of the universities They are learned sound and agreeable discourses but contain nothing of impor tance that is either original or profound WVe have received from the University of Minnesota a useful pamphlet

for American students The library facilities that our country affords are so comparatively inadequate to the elucidation of the minuter problems of European history and our want of manuscript sources is so entire that the American investigator who cannot transfer the scene of his labors for a time at least across the ocean works at a decided disad572 Reviews of Books vantage as compared with his English or continental colleague if he attacks a European and especially a mediaeval theme Yet such studies must be undertaken if our graduate schools are to cultivate breadth of his toric knowledge as well as accuracy of historic method and the roll of American writers upon European themes is a sufficient proof that much of value may be accomplished in this field Dr Thompson deserves credit for having swerved from the usual path of the American graduate student in history and chosen the more arduous course On the whole he has been rewarded with a good degree of success His sketch of the French monarchy under Louis VI is a conscientious painstaking piece of work based on an extensive acquaintance with the sources and literature of the subject In especial his voluminous bibliography is to be commended His portrait of the French king and his account of the methods by which the royal power was exercised and augmented give little ground for dissent But it is Dr Thompsons misfortune that the special field chosen has been made so fully his own by M Achille Luchaire whose elaborate investigations into this portion of Capetian history have appeared in a series of monographs and volumes beginning in i88o that what was left for the laborious gathering of the American gleaner contains little that is novel Nor is the writers treatment of the several heads into which he divides his theme as extensive as it might profitably have been made This is conspicuously the case in the chapter entitled Administrative Organiza tion and a similar criticism is deserved by that headed  The Liberation of the Realm Dr Thompsons own sympathies it is probable were most aroused by the rising manifestations of the Third Estate At all events his work is to be seen at its best in the section designated  King and Communes Royalty and the Popular Classes The essay under review has worth in itself but its highest value is as a promise of yet better things in the futuire from its author W W The Kings Peace by F A Inderwick QC New York Macmillan and Co I895 pp XXiV 254 is the second in the Social England series edited by Mr Kenelrn D Cotes In this book Mr Inderwick has pre sented a sketch of the English courts of law their officers jurisdictions and procedure The history of the courts is divided by the author into five periods marked by the dominance alternately of the principle of cen tralization and decentralization by the existence of national or local courts of uniform or varied powers The special topics discussed are the courts of general jurisdiction of local jurisdiction of special jurisdiction as the manorial courts the forest courts the admiralty courts and the Star Chamber the officers of the courtsthe chancellor the justiciar the barons and the serjeantsatlaw and the procedure by compurgation by ordeal and by torture The value of the book is qualified by the character of the premises That the English law the English peace is the Kings law and the Kings peace is the theory of the older jurists Happily however the text isMinor Notices 5 73 not followed and it is in other and minor matters that the authors legal conservatism is especially observable In the discussion of the forest courts and law in particular he maintains the validity of the Forest Charter of Cnut Dr Liebermann to the contrary notwithstanding Again in the discussion of the influence of the Roman law upon English law he hazards a douibt in spite of Mr Maitlands recent assurances on that subject In spite of these failures the failures rather of a legal antiqluarian than of an historian the book will possess a value and an interest for the general reader an interest enhanced by several wellchosen illustrations and a value increased by the presentation of a short

Century as reflected in Contemporay Literatulre Part I Rural Changes He has had the happy idea of adding a reproduction in miniature of one of the Oxfordshire openfield maps published in I889 by the Clarendon Press at the instance of the late Mr Mowat but already very difficult to get hold of and of adding also a reproduction of an excellent photograph recently taken by himself of an openfield

perhaps unknown The publication is one among many recent indications of the growing interest in the economic side of history and it formis an excellent intro duiction to the subject But it could be wished that Professor Cheyney had not shown quite so much tender mercy for the literary students as to refrain almost entirely as here he does from expressing his own opinion on some of the legal and economic questions still under discussion in regard to the enclosure movement On the former he would have got some help from Professor Maitlands History of English Law and on the latter from Professor

Captain Fer nandez Duros La Armnadia Inveicible The letter is a very interesting one574 Reviews of Books and gives a graphic picture of the demoralization of the Armada as it made its fatal attempt to circumnavigate Scotland and Ireland and of the suffer ings of the multitudes who were wrecked on the Irish coast Cuellar was wrecked in ORourkes country and with many romantic adventures made his way to that of OCahan where he finally found ship for Scotland His picture of the condition of Ireland is sufficiently horrible  To sum up he says  in that country there is neither justice nor right and everybody does what he likes These savages liked us very much for they knew that we were great enemies to the heretics and had come against them and had it not been for them not one of us would now be alive We were very grate ful to them for this although they were the first to rob and plunder those of us who reached the land alive Mr C H Firth has put the world greatly in his debt by bringing to light interesting manuscripts long lying obscure in the library of Worcester Col lege Oxford Chief among these are the papers of William Clarke secre tary to the Council of the Army I647I649 and to General Monck and the commanders of the army in Scotland I65ii66o which Mr Firth edited for the Camden Society The Journal of Joachim Hane I653 i654 Oxford B H Blackwell London T Fisher Unwin 1896 pp xxxii 103 another find of Mr Firths in the library of Worcester College has but small worth as compared with the Clarke Papers Hane was a Ger man military engineer attached to Cromwell in the latter years of the Civil XVar and employed by him at last in secret service in France In that country he spent some months during which sojourn becoming discovered he underwent the most painful trials living constantly in danger of torture and death After his return to England he described his adventures in the record now for the first time brought forth and printed Little interest attaches to the figure of Hane He was a foreign soldier who at the close of the Thirty Years War like hundreds more drifted across to England where fighting was still going on The record shows him to have been pious after the fashion of the time he was trustworthy and had skill in his profession He was quite untouched however by any of the greatness which marked some of the figures in daily contact with him The Journal forms a pendant appropriate enough to the Clarke Papers but deserves no large amount of attention For such a hand as that of Mr Firth the careful introduction and notes seem like labor hardly well bestowed J K H It is not altogether easy to decide upon the amount of attention that a historical review ought to give to The Life and Writings of Turgot Contp trollerGeneral of France 774776 edited for English readers by W Walker Stephens London Longmans Green and Co 1895 pp ix 331 With the aid mainly of Condorcets and M Leon Says biographies of the editions of Turgots works by Dupont de Nemours and Daire and of the general histories of France Mr Stephens has put together in workmanMinor Nolices 575 like fashion and readable form a brief I55 pp and of course sketchy life of Turgot with abundant quotations from his authorities To this is appended a translation of certain  Selected Writings of Turgot including the larger part of the Eloge de Gournay It cannot but be regretted in spite of the reasons here assigned p 229 that Mr Stephens did not see fit to give us a translation of the Reflexions sur la Formation et la Dizsri btion des Richesses for that reprinted in 1859 in one of the Overstone volumes of Economical Tracts is practically inaccessible to most students There is thus absolutely nothing original in Mr Stephenss volume and even for the English reader unable to use French books little that he will not find in Mr Morleys essay and Mr Massons translation from M Leon Say Mr Stephens moreover shows no great knowledge of eighteenth century French thought in general or of economic thought in particular and he has missed an excellent opportunity to give us a resumne in English of the literature that has recently grown up  at the hands chiefly of Pro fessor Oncken  concerning the Physiocratic group to which Turgot be longed Nevertheless the book makes no pretence to be what it is not it is written with a sympathy which ought to prove contagious with those who take it up knowing nothing of its subject and in any college where classes study French history or the history of political economy without being able to read French  and we cannot but fear that such cases are not unknown it will be interesting and therefore useful W J A M Anatole LeroyBeaulieu Israel among the NVaions a Study of the Jews and Anisemitismn translated by Frances Hellman New York G P Putnams Sons I895 pp XXiii 385 has studied the Jew for the noblest of purposes A disciple of him who said Beat ipaczfci he writes to promote the advent of a kingdom which is  peace through justice  for all classes and all individuals Reciting the modern emancipation of the Jews after the initiative of France in 179I he estimates the present distri bution and movement of this population and proceeds to show the folly of the present revival of antagonism to the people thus recently made con spicuous by the free exercise of their talents This antagonism has the triple strength of religious intolerance national or racial exclusiveness and mercantile competition The economic aspect is here neglected with the promise of another volume on the role played by money among the nations of today M LeroyBeaulieu has an easy task in showing the groundlessness of religious apprehensions concerning Judaism and neatly confounds the dread felt for Jews as dangerous to national ideals by showing that the identification of religious and national unity is a lower  Oriental and Slavic  stage of development which western Europe outgrew in the expe riences of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries The superstition is thus reduced to one remaining element our author divides in order to conquer The racial antagonism is then undermined by attempting to show that576 Reviews of Books Jewish blood belongs to all Western peoples and that the Jews have a large admixture of Aryan stock These positions are finely strategic but the campaign after all has rather the air of a prolonged skirmish Most read ers have patience for a little more system and consecutiveness along with the epigrammatic diversion Moreover Mr Flinders Petries recent discus sion of the meaning of race suggests that M LeroyBeaulieu has lnot suc ceeded in perfornming  the vanishing trick  with the Jewish race Since Antisemitism has no substantial basis how has it come to pass The author claims to write both as a Christian and a Frenchman and we are not surprised that this disturbance in  the Europe of the Hohenzol lerns  p 370 is no mere case of atavism The craze started in Germany in I879 It is a Kulturkan5f It was the retort of German Catholicism in the anticlerical campaign led by Berlin journals under Jewish editors  Make front against Rome  was answered by  Make front against New Jerusalem and the cry was then caught up by Prussian Protestants and passed to the priests of Russia and the Catholics of Austria and France It is a blundering diagnosis of the malady of institutional decay and the blunder is in origin the offspring of Teutonic pride Possibly the prom ised volume on the money power will elucidate this Several admirable and entertaining chapters discuss the physical men tal and moral traits and aptitudes of the Jew arguing that the peculiar differentiation of the Jew is largely due to enforced isolation in the past and that Jewish particularism must vanish in the process of free assimila tion to national organisms For the Judaism that would survive only as a cosmopolitan religion M LeroyBeaulieu has the noblest sentiments of respect and goodwill F A C The Directors of the Old South Work have served the convenience of many libraries students and teachers of history by putting their valuable series of Old South Leaflets into bound volumes each volume

been printed in order to illustrate topics of local history or other special topics fromn time to time taken up in the Old South courses it may suffice to enumerate those which illustrate the constitutional history of the United States the Constitution the Articles of Confederation the Declaration of Independence Vanes Healing Question the Charter of Massachusetts Bay the Fundamental

Casgrain While serving in Canada Bougainville wrote numerous letters a journal and memoirs in all of which he speaks in dis paraging terms of the Canadian military and civil service The officers he says were ignorant of the art of war as known in Europe they allowed by their negligence if they did not encourage the atrocious massacres by the Indians of English prisoners and corruption ruled in the commissariat department to such an extent that the French troops were on the verge of starvation Bougainville even accuses erroneously the Governor the Marquis de Vaudreuil a Canadian by birth of sharing in this robbery The Abbe Casgrain an ardent Canadian patriot in his Montcam el LEevis and in some volumes of documents edited by him for the Quebec govern ment turns the attack upon Bougainville whom he describes as a Jansenist a gambler a roue and more M de Kerallain writing on behalf of the descendants of Bougainville excuses his late reply because as he hints designedly the Abbes book has only recently become known in France Probably however no one regrets more than the Abbe the tardy interest that the French have shown in his work He is said now as an editor to have been careless about securing a pure text to have arranged his docu ments uncritically and to have added too few notes as an author to copy Parkman servilely to make unfulfilled claims to original research and above all to show peculiar venom towards Bougainville This is especially evident M de Kerallain thinks in the charge that Bougainville was to blame for the massacre of the English sick and wounded at Fort George and he now shows that Bougainville was a junior officer there and in no way responsible for what was done The author writes angrily but is master of the literature of his subject and gives copious citations of authorities The numerous letters of Bougainville some now printed for the first time show him as an affectionate relative a keen observer a piquant writer and a highminded soldier M de Kerallain promises a complete history of Bougainvilles long and varied career G M W The American Jewish Historical Society has issued No 4 of its Publi cations containing papers presented at the third annual meeting held at Washington in December I894 Two of the papers are of much interest those of Dr Cyrus Adler on the trial of Jorge de Almeida by the Inquisi tion in Mexico and of Dr George A Kohut on Jewish Martyrs of the In quisition in South America the rest are of little importance Dr Adler describes from manuscript materials found in a bookstore in Washington the trial of a Jew who in I609 having fled was condemned in his absence by the Holy Office at Mexico and burned in effigy The documents give an interesting picture of the position and life of the Marranos in that city Dr Kohuts paper contains a large amount of learned and interesting matter but conveys it in a confused order and with little regard to the distinction between original and

to the testimony of Quakers against negro slavery a letter of Gouverneur Morris regarding the opening of the StatesGeneral a letter of the London printer William Strahan written in I770 a long letter

the southernmost colonies Several letters written by Mrs John Jay in Spain and France to Mrs Robert Morris I780i783 have also a certain interest as a picture of European society as it presented itself to the mind of an American lady Of the original articles which are included in the miscellany the greater number are connected with the history of Philadel phia and the surrounding region An exception is Mr Edward Ingles article on The Parish in Virginia but this appeared in I885 in the Johns Hopkins University Studies No accessible collection of material relating to the political history of the thirty years succeeding the Revolution aside from those in the library of the Department of State is so important as the mass of Pickering Papers possessed by the Massachusetts Historical Society The Society has performed a service of inestimable value to careful students of this period by printing as Vol VIII of the Sixth Series of its Collections an Historical Index to these papers The index has been prepared upon an admirable plan and with consummate care It makes a volume of s8o pages containing an abstract of every letter with an entry ulnder every im portant subject alluded to therein The entries of subjects of persons writing to Colonel Pickering and of persons to whom he wrote are all embraced in one alphabetical arrangement but with such typographical distinctions as make it easy to determine to which of these three classes the entry belongs The indexing was performed by Miss Harriet E Green under the direction of a committee of which the late Mr Edward J Lowell was chairman but which finally consisted of Messrs C C Smith A L Lowell Roger Wolcott and S F McCleary The manuscript collec tion indexed consists of 58 volumes illustrating with great fulness the his tory of events

to embrace the reports orders and correspondence both Union and Confederate relating to all naval operations on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and inland waters of the United States during the Civil War together with the opera tions of vessels acting singly either as cruisers or privateers in different parts of the world The second series is to embrace the reports orders and correspondence relating to the administration of naval affairs such as the construction and outfit of the two navies matters relating to naval captures and prisoners etc The third series is to embrace papers not belonging to the first two The first series is to consist of seven principal divisions relating respectively to the operations of the cruisers during the war to the initial operations in the Gulf of Mexico to the initial operations on the Atlantic coast to the operations on the Potomac and Rappahannock rivers during the whole war to the history of the Atlantic blockading squadrons to that of the Gulf

research reveals between these dates a number of lotteries so enormous as to raise his theme into a subject of the greatest importance in the social history of the state That Rhode Island was in a peculiar degree infested with these enterprises is not probable she was the fourth state to prohibit them yet the author shows that in the first twentyfive years few and poor as were the inhabitants

pamphlets relating to Texas and furnishes a complete collation of the laws of the Republic and State Beside titles bearing upon Texan history a great many titles of books written by Texans or printed in Texas are included Yet since manifestly not all such are included it is hard to say whether the plan of the book is that of a historical or of a general bibliography Neither the title nor the preface gives a clear idea of the authors plan The work has been done with great industry and zeal and the book will be indispensable to all who work in Texan history Yet no careful student will fail to wish frequently during his use of it that it had been made with more accuracy and with more knowledge of the refinements of bibliography Examination shows many cases in which even the alphabetical order is not perfectly preserved there is hardly a Spanish title in the book in which there is not a misprint and the same must be said of many of the French and German titles Other errors and infelicities are not uncommon The book is clearly printed

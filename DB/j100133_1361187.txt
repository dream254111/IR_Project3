bizarre and curious creatures that live in our county it would be hard to find one more arbitrarily marked or colored more apparently in opposition to all the laws of protective grad ation and coloration than the Mearns quail or as has been longer known the Massena partridge or Fool Quail It is especially noticeable in this case since the other genera in the family are among the most remarkable exponents of the per fection of locality painting being dark above where the most light strikes them and pale below where the shadow comes thus making a monotinted ground upon which the most exquisite detail of scenery is painted This assiststhe creature to be assimilated into its natural setting to a degree which only those who have come face to face with a sitting grouse or quail can truly appreciate Therefore when we see the fantastic little cock Massena with his dark chestnut breast jet black belly and flanks and harlequinpainted head it is hard to conceive how he was ever able to qualify in the race for survival among a group of birds so marvellously protected as his congeners With the prospect of a field trip into the Big Bend Country in western Texas I looked forward with the keenest pleasure to meeting the Mearns quail Cyrlonyx montezumee mearnsi for I felt sure that he would in some ingenious way justify his bold deviation from his familys stock traits The accounts I had heard of his stupid tameness made me wonder the more for it is a fairly good rule that those birds most beautifully assimilable in their natural landscape rely on their inconspicuousness the most and those which do not thus hide in full view take flight or run on the apprehension of danger Here seemed to be a strong contradiction which I hoped to solveI 14 THE CONDOR VOL V Our first invasion into his territory was in the Chisos mountains at the ex treme reach of the Big Bend of the Rio Grande After a long hot ride we finally ascended the footslopes at about sunset and worked into a dwindling trail which finally became lost in an old arroyo coming down from a great gulch in the mountains We camped at last by a well that one of our number discovered in the brush about fifty yards from the trail and tired and hungry almost to oblivion we ate our bacon beans and biscuit and rolled up in our blankets in the beautiful glow of the full moon I awoke in the cool just before sunup and was lazily dressing half out of my sleepingbag when my sleepy eye caught a slight motion in the grass about twenty feet away I looked and became aware that I was staring at my first Mearns quail Even as I took in the fact he apparently framed up his ideas as to his vision and telling himself in a quiet little quailvoice that it were perhaps as well to move on and look from a safer distance he slimmed down his trim little form and ran a few steps Meanwhile I was clumsily trying to get my gun out from under my sleeping bag where I had put it to keep it out of the dew The quail getting wiser every second doubled his trot and with head erect and body trim ran like a plover for a few yards through the short desert grass and with a true quail frrrrrrrr burst into flight and dropped into the thick brush across the arroyo The most noticeable thing about him as I watched him running was the curious use of his queer little crest Instead of elevating it as the mountain quail does his he raised his painted head on slim neck and spread his flowing crest laterally till it looked like half a mushroom giving him the most curious appearance imaginable When he flew I marked him down carefully hastily drew my boots half on grabbed my gun and stumped after him with all speed I got to his point within a short time but thrash and kick around as I might I never succeeded in making him flush a second time Thus ended the first chance Later when we had reached the foot of the gulch and made camp under a noble old pinyon we had opportunity to learn more about the quail tho we never had such a good view as that first one A curious quavering owllike cry attracted our noveltyseeking ears A pigmy owl perhaps Tho frequently heard in the scrubby oaks at the edge of the woods or even in the woods it proved a true will o thewisp and invariably led us out into the bastinghot brush on the hillside among the cacti and sliderock At first we approached it cautiously or carefully tried to round it up by going to either side of it But it always eluded us and we had only our guesses to tell what it was We were beginning to guess right however and one lucid day I decided to waste no more time So the next time the sad little cry sounded off I went toward it as fast as possible until I thought I was near the place Then I stopped and listened Again Only waiting long enough to ascertain that the sound came from a particularly dense bunch of Dasy lerion cactus and other desert brush I jumped in and made for the place never heeding the noise I was making On to the point and right on when frrr rrrrrrr out biled a cock Massena andfrrrrrrrr out went the hen after him at another angle I was nearly ready but not quite and by the time I was on him he had dropped woodcocklike after a flight of only a rod or two So also had the hen So there were no quail for me this time as I was unable to flush them again But I had found a wy and knew that some day Id make it succeed Later I had the pleasure of seeing a beautiful cock shot by one of the others and the next day the strange pinkish hen was brought in With a wider knowledge of the birds ways and the kind of cover he preferred his curious markings seemed less of a contradiction Many partridges have black or very dark ventral patches whichSEPT 1903  THE CONDOR 15 they obviate by squatting the Gambel partridge chestnutbellied scaled quail the European partridge and others and Mearns quail has this same thing only to a greater extent He chooses the densest and deepest brush cover for a retreat and like the meadowlark keeps his wonderfully graded back toward the dangerside The illustration from Mr Baileys photograph shows how easily he becomes in conspicuous by this simple trick and it is fair to attribute his black ventral mark ings to other causes than that of direct protection when offset by the facts of his chosen cover and the remarkably protective character of his upper parts And like many other sharply marked creatures the very contrasts which look so con spicuous when seen in the hand isolated from the sharp lights and shadows of the natural environment serve to so cut up the creature that in nature all semb lance of a bird is lost the head is cut from the body and then reduced to a non committal jumble which is one with what lies beyond In the gulch near where we were camped was a lovely little mountain brook coming from a seepbasin high in the mountains tumbling as a threadlike fall from a tall cliff at the head of the gulch a mile above camp In the canyon were noble jack oaks gnarly arbutus trees and a few nutstudded pines and upon the steep talus slope stood a splen did grove of tall conifers This place was naturally the center of bird life and here we found for the first time within our borders the Couch jay Aphelocoma sieberi couchi Stephens whippoorwills Antrostomus v macromystax and bandtailed pigeons Columbafasciata were here and numbers of carpinteros the noisy and sociable anteating woodpeckers Melanerpes formicivorus Oc casionally a big bluethroated hummer Cwli gena clemencid would come skittling up the gulch for all the world like a little swift uttering his sharp little squeak every two seconds Perhaps he would alight on the dead lower twigs of a drooping pine branch and jumble his squeaks together into a kind of little song more likely he would zip by like a bullet and disappear up the gulch These and many other rare and interesting birds mademe temporarily neglect the quail after a few more failures and I left the Chisos without a single bird But my hope was yet young and as we moved up toward the Davis mountains I had visions of a brace These like the first failed to materialize as did those which I harbored for the Sacramento in New Mexico Late in the summer we left Carlsbad New Mexico with our outfit heading for the Guadaloupe mountains the Walloopias of the natives for our last mountain work of the season Up we went from the Pecos desert into the juniperclad foothills where we camped our first night In the morning I looked around and was surprised at what I saw Indeed I rubbed my eyes to see if

VOL V were seeing aright Goats in trees  Yes it was all right and there in the sprawl ing junipers feeding or resting were numbers of white Angora goats the chief product of the country as comfortably at home as cats  We soon left the goat country and went up through the bigger growth of the up per Transition Zone and finally came down again into the seniitropical atmosphere of Dog Canyon Up through this broad waterless sun baked basin we worked un til sixty miles further up we came again into the junipers and yellow pines Oak covered hills rose at our sides and ahead of us ending in barren rock ridges fifteen hundred or two thousand feet above us The high gulches were rich in timber but poor in surface water This place was the last stand of the Mescalero Apaches and their weedgrown mescal pits arrowheads and bits of broken pottery gave evidence of their happy days as plain ly as the corroded cartridges of the old Government Henry 50s that we found attested to theirfinal destruction New things attracted us here and our stay of four days was among the pleasantest of our summers experiences The gulches offered most of interest so three of our days were spent in work ing between camp and the crests 8500 feet above sea But we had come into this camp in the late afternoon and had had no opportunity to look over the hot basin So I decided on our last afternoon to make a good strong search of the lower levels and started from camp at about two oclock with a visitor who had met up with us and who said he would like to go out We went down gulch and had hardly been out half an hour when we heard the old familiar seductive call Mearns quail three points off the weather bow Well soon after we put them up my friend got one and I another They were cock and hen both well shot and in strangely good feather for the time of year He was good enough to say he had shot his for me and in less than an hour I was back at camp happy as a king painting my Mearns quail Thus ended the last chance for the next day before sunup we broke camp and left the mountains for good l o w      CHISOS MOUNTAINS FROM BELOW ROCK SPRING a  MEARNS QUAIL WHITE MTS N M

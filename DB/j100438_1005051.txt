THLE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIEITY NEW SERIES NO 1 DESCRIPTIONS OF INSECTS OF THE FAMILIES OF CARABICI AND HY DROCANTHARI OF LATREILLE INHABITING JXORTH AMERICA BY THOMAS SAYIEAD 26TH AUG 1819 IN THE FIRST VOLUME OF THE NEW SERIES OF THE TRANSACTIONS OF THIS SOCIETY I COMMENCED THE REGULAR DESCRIPTION OF OUR NORTH AMERICAN INSECTS BY A MONOGRAPH OF THE INDIGENOUS CICINDELETOE A LINNOEAN GENUS WHICH OCCUPIES THE FIRST STATION IN THE IMPROVED CLASSIFICATION OF LATREILLE I NOW PROCEED TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH OF OUR NATIVE INSECTS AS WERE INCLUDED BY LINNE IN HIIS THIREE GENERA CARABUS DYTISCUS AND GYRINUS THE TWO FORMER OF THESE BUT MORE PARTICULARLY THE FIRST ARE NOW CONSIDERED AS GREAT FANMILIES CONSTITUTING NUMEROUS GENERA AND AGREEABLY TO THE ORDER IN WHICH I HAVE ENUMERATED THEM IMMEDIATELY SUCCEEDING THE CICINDELETWE IN THE SYSTEM WHICH I HAVE ADOPTED THE CARABII ARE VERY NUMEROUS ARE INSECTIVOROUS TER RESTRIAL COMTMONLY INHABITING MOIST PLACES UNDER STONES OR VOL IIAX DESCRIPTION OF INSECTS FALLEN TREES UNDER BARK OR ON FLOWERS 4C THEY GENERALLY RUN BRISKLY WHIEN DISTURBED AND MANY SPECIES DIFFUSE A FWETID ODOR OR DISCHARGE A PECULIAR PUNGENT ACETOUS GAS THE DYTISCII ARE MUCH LESS NUMEROUS THAN THE PRECEDING BUT ARE EQUALLY NOURISHED BY ANIMAL FOOD THEY INHIABIT THE WATERS OCCASIONALLY VISITING THE SURFACE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RESPIRATION THEY MOVE WITH RAPIDITY AND EASE THROUGH THE WATER AND THE AIR BUT ON LAND THIEIR GAIT IS EMBARRASSED BY THE IIATATORY FORM OF THE POSTERIOR FEET THE GYRINII WHICH ARE NOW INCLUDED IN THE SAME FAMILY WITH THE DYTISCII ARE COMPARATIVELY FEW IN NUMBER OF SPECIES AND THOSE FEW ARE SO INTIMATELY UNITED IN NATURE BY A SIMILARITY OF CHARACTER AND HABIT THAT NO DIVISION HAS YET BEEN FOUND NECESSARY IN THE GENUS WHICH STILL REMAINS UN CHANGED AS IT WAS FIRST ESTABLISHIED IN THE ARTIFICIAL SYSTEM TRHESE INSECTS LIKE THOSE OF THIE PRECEDING LINNFEAN GENUS ARE INSECTIVOROUS AND AQUATIC THEY DO NOT HOWEVER LIKE TLHEM REMAIN AT THE BOTTOM TO SEEK THEIR PREY BUT CHIEFLY CONFINE THEMSELVES TO THE SURFACE THEY DESCRIBE GRACEFUL CURVATURES OR GYRATIONS ON THE STURFACE OF THE WATER WITH A PLEASING FACILITY OF MOVETMENT WITLHOUT EXHIBITING TO THE EYE THE OARLIKE FEET BY WLHICH THAT CELERITY IS EFFECTED WHEN ALARMED THEY DIVE TO THE BOTTOM WITH SWIFTNESS CARRYING WITH THEM A GLOBULE OF AIR THAT THEIR RESPIRATION NMAY NOT BE SUSPENDED WHEN IRRITATED THEY EJECT A LACTESCENT FLUID WHICH IN MANY INSTANCES DIFFUSES AN AGREEABLE ODOR SOMEWLHAT SIMILAR TO THAT OF THE CALYCANTHUS FLOIIDUS OF BO TANISTS THEY FLY WITH MUCH EASE ANID CLHIEFLY AT NIGHT BUT THEIR TNOVEMENTS ON LAND ARE UNCOUTH AND EMBARRASSED AFTER THUS BRIEFTY NOTICING THE MOST PROMINENT FEATURES EXHIBITED BY THESE INSECTS IT MAY BE PROPER TO OBSERVE THAT THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE DRAWN OUT FROM SUCH SPECIMENS ONLY AS HAVE FALLEN UNDER MY OWN OBSERVATION AND WHICH I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING AND CORNPARING TOGETHER IN ORDER THE MORE EFFECTUALLY TO INDICATE THEIR DIFFERENTIAL CHARACTERS THE INDIVIDUALS ARE CHIEFLY PRESERVED IN MY CABINET AND FOR SUCH AS I DO NOT POSSESS I HAVE CAREFULLY REFERRED TO THOSE COLLECTIONS FROM WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED THEM I HAVE SCRUINHABITING NORTH AMERICA 3 PULOUSLY RETAINED ALL THE SPECIFIC NAMES WHICH HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE LATE REV F V MELSHEIMER IN HIS CATALOGUE OF THE INSECTS OF PENNSYLVANIIA EXCEPTING ONLY SUCH AS HAVE BEEN LREVIOUSLY EMPLOYED IN THE SAME GENERA BY OTHER EN TOMOLOGISTS AND SO FAR AS I COULD ASCERTAIN THEM BY THE AID OF THE SCIENTITIC INTELLIGENCE OF HIS SON THE REV J F MEL SHEIMER WHO HAS LIBERALLY FURNISHED MNE WITH SPECIRNENS FROM HIS COLLECTION I AMN ALSO INDEBTED TO MR TLHONMAS NUTTALL WHO HAS CONFIDED TO MY CARE HIS ENTIRE COLLECTION WITH PERMISSION TO AVAIL MYSELF OF THE OPPORTUNITY OF DE SCRIBING SUCH OF THEMI AS ARE NEW I HAVE NOT THOUGHT IT NECESSARY TO DRAW OUT THE GENERIC DESCRIPTIONS AT LENGTH AS THIS HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE WITH SUFFICIENIT DETAIL BY PROFESSOR BONELLI OF IURIN WHOSE EXCEL LENT PAPERS I HAVE NOT YET HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO PERUSE IF IN THE DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE SPECIES I HAVE BEEN AN TICIPATED BY THE LABOURS OF THIS OR ANY OTHER AUTLOR I SHALL IMMEDIATELY RELINQUISH MY CLAIMS AND DO JUSTICE TO THE REAL DISCOVERERS WHENI THEIR LABOURS SHALL MEET MY EYE TRO THE INFLEXIBLE LINNFEAN ENTOMOLOGIST WHO MAY OBJECT TO THE NUMEROUS GENERA WHICH ARE HERE ADOPTED I WILL MERELY OBSERVE THAT EACH OF THOSE DIVISIONS WHICH ARE LHERE CALLED FAMILIES HE MAY REGARD AS ONLY GENERA AS THEY COINCIDE WITH THOSE OF LINNAEUS AND TO EACH OF THE SPECIES DESCRIBED HE MAY ADD THE CHARACTERS OF THOSE DIVISIONS WHICH ARE IN THIS ESSAY CALLED GENERA THUS THE SYSTEM AS IT STANDS COM PLICATED AS IT IS BY THE VAST ACCESSION OF DISCOVERIES OF RECENT DATE WILL AFFORD HITN EVERY FACILITY WHICH HE MIGHT SUPPOSE TO RESULT FROMN A SCRUPULOUS ADHERENCE TO THE LINNAEAN MIETHOD THE MODERN ENTOMOLOGIST WILL READILY PERCEIVE THAT I HAVE NOT ADOPTED ALL THE GENERA OF M BONELLI BUT THAT NMANY OF THESE ARE INCLUDED UNDER THE GENUS FERONIA OF LATREILLE IN THIS RESPECT I HAD NO OPTION  HAVING NO DEFINITIONS OF SUCH GENERA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THOSE CONTAINED IN THE REGNE ANIMAL MANY OF WLHICH ARE TOO BRIEF TO BE EXCLUSIVELY RE LIED UPON 24 DESCRIPTION OF INSECTS ENUMERATION OF SPECIES BRACHINUS B FUMANS CYMINDIS 1 C SINUATUS 2 C DECORUS

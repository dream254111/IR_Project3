for comparison with the new Pro fessor Alexander McAdie director of the ob servatory will be glad to help any one wishing to adopt this new pressure scale These changes were first proposed for adoption in the United States by him in 1908 IN the report for the year ending March 31 1913 the Meteorological Committee of Eng land announces that the centibar or millibar will be used instead of the inch as far as pos sible for all barometric measurements Speci mens of daily and weekly weather reports are given with pressures expressed in dynamic pressure units instead of inches of mercury and with temperatures in absolute centigrade degrees RADIATION AND CLOUD GROWTH IN the October Meteorologische Zeitschrift 2 Dr C Braak of Batavia Java ascribes to radiation certain peculiar phases in the devel opment of cumulus clouds His description of the formation of these clouds on a calm day may be stated as follows When the rising sun has warmed the earth sufficiently to drive local air masses to the condensation level at first single then many small cumuli appear which soon cover the whole sky Here and there larger heads rise out of the rather flat cloud sheet Soon after reaching their maxi mum height they disappear If the cumulus growth continues to the cirrus level about 10 kilometers altitude the top flattens out The lower column melts away and leaves this grow ing sheet When through energetic upward movement the cumulus cloud rises to even greater heights there is no longer a maximum level where the vertical movement stops the condensed moisture falls out and in the upper I See Alexander McAdie New Units in Aerol ogy Scientific American Supplement December 6 1913 p 357 2  vUber dent Einfluss der Strahlung auf die Wolkenbildung  parts of the cloud the air flows toward all sides forming gigantic cirrus rays Thus there seems to be a division of the atmosphere into two parts as regards cloud building This has a certain analogy with the division of the atmosphere into troposphere and stratosphere the former designates the atmosphere to a height where decrease of tem perature with altitude ceases and the latter the isothermal region of unknown vertical ex tent above this According to Messrs Gold and HumphreysO this is a radiation effect of the air Below the stratosphere radiation ex ceeds absorption and convection balances the loss of heat while in the stratosphere absorp tion exceeds radiation so the temperature rises over that of convective equilibrium If one considers the disappearance of the lower part of the cumulus cloud to be the result of cooling and the continuance and energy of the upper part as the result of warming the analogy be comes nearly complete Observations in cumu lus clouds over Batavia within the lower few kilometers show that the clouds are colder than the surrounding air at the same level Radiation may thus have greater importance in cloud processes than is commonly assigned to it EXCESSIVE

charts charts of equal changes of pressure in addition to the usual isobaric charts His study of the former indicates that pressure changes are of primary importance while cyclonic and anticyclonic phenomena are secondary A thorough sttdy of the thunderstorm ob servations in Germany for 1910 has recently appeared6 The thunderstorm observations of 1570 stations are printed in extenso and sum marized in a number of tables The mean velocity for 979 thunderstorms was 38 kilo meters per hour the extreme velocities were 9 and 95 kilometers per hour Twenty per cent of the thunderstorms came in May forty per cent in June and twenty per cent in July There is a special article on the destructive thunderstorm of May 11 1910 The British Rainfall Association under the direction of Dr HI R Mill deserves credit for its large 52d volume  British Rainfall 1912 Part 1 contains three special articles on  The Great Rainst6rm of August 252f 1912  C The Wettest Summer in England and Wales and The Seathwaitepattern Rain gauge Part 2 is an extensive treatment of the British rainfall data of 1912 Part 3 is a general table of the rainfall observed at 5272 stations The report of the FrancoSwedish sounding balloon expedition in Lapland 1907 1908 and 1909 1ias been published recently As in middle latitudes the base of the stratosphere was en counlered at a mean elevation of twelve kilo meters with temperatures of  506 to  600 0 These temperatures are higher than those at the base of the stratosphere in equatorial regions where records of  800 C are not uncommon7 d Das Wefter auf der

Meteorological Observatory is now part of the Division of Geology of Harvard University the members of that Division visited the Ob servatory November 8 Professor Alexander McAdie the new Director gave an address on Modern Methods of Ftostfighting The Smithsonian Institution is to reopen the Langley Aerodynamical Laboratory which was closed a few years ago The first serious contribution from the scientific side of aero nautics is to be found in the work of Langley His original purpose was not to construct a flying machine but to determine the laws governing flight Two wind tunnels are to be made for tests on models In addition to these experiments an aircraft fieldlabora tory is proposed for measurements of stress moments of inertia etc and for the adjust ment and repair of several fullscale land and water aeroplanes The part which high humidity plays in pro ducing heat stroke was well illustrated in Vienna on August 20 1913 With the relative humidity around eighty per cent and tempera tures between 200 and 230 C several suffered from heat prostration The council of the Royal Meteorological Society has awarded the Symons Gold Medal to Mr W H Ditesi FRS in recognition of the

COMMUNICATED TO THE SOCIETY,I206924,198 RECEIVED JUNE 19 1769 XXVIII AN ACCOUNT OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IN AMPHIBIOUS ANIMALS BY MR WILLIAM HEWSON LECTURER IN ANATOMY IN A LETTER TO WILLIAM HUNTER M D F R S AND BY HIM COMMUNICATED TO THE SOCIETY SIR AGREEABLE TO THE PROMISE WHICH I MADE IN A POSTSCRIPT TO THE PAPER ON THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM IN BIRDS WHICH THE ROYAL SOCIETY DID ME THE HONOUR OF PUBLISHING IN THEIR LAST VOLUME I NOW TAKE THE LIBERTY OF BEGGING OF YOU TO PRESENT TO THE LEARNED SOCIETY AN ACCOUNT OF THE SAME SYSTEM IN A TURTLE I SHOULD LIKEWISE HAVE ADDED A FIGURE OF THAT ANIMAL HAD NOT THESE VESSELS AGREED IN SO MANY PARTICULARS WITH THOSE IN BIRDS THAT I FLATTERED MYSELF THE DESCRIPTION WOULD BE INTELLIGIBLE WITHOUT IT READ NOV 9 1769 THIS SYSTEM IN A TURTLE LIKE THAT IN BIRDS CONSISTS OF THE LACTEALS AND LYMPHATICS AND THEIR COMMON TRUNKS OR THE THORACIC DUCTS IT AGREES LIKEWISE WITH THAT IN BIRDS IN NOT HAVING ANY VISIBLE LYMPHATIC GLANDS EITHER ON THE MESENTERY OR NEAR THE THORACIC DUCTS BUT DIFFERS199 DIFFERS FROM THAT IN BIRDS IN NOT HAVING ANY GLANDS UPON THE LARGER LYMPHATICS OF THE NECK AT LEAST I AM INCLINED TO BELIEVE SO FROM NOT HAVING SEEN ANY IN THE DIS SECTION OF ONE ANIMAL OF THIS SPECIES IN WHICH I LOOKED FOR THEM IT LIKEWISE DIFFERS FROM THAT IN BIRDS IN ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE TO BE TAKEN NOTICE OF HEREAFTER WHETHER IT AGREES WITH THE SAME SYSTEM IN BIRDS IN THE TRANSPARENCY AND WANT OF COLOUR IN THE CHYLE I CANNOT TAKE UPON ME TO DETERMINE AS I DID NOT SEE ANY OF THAT FLUID IN THIS SUBJECT A THE FOLLOWING DESCRIPTION I TOOK FROM THE ANIMAL AFTER I HAD INJECTED THE LARGER BRANCHES OF THIS SYSTEM WITH A COLOURED WAX AND THE SMALLER WITH QUICK SILVER TO AVOID MY BEING MISUNDERSTOOD WHEN I SPEAK OF THE SITUATION OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS I SHALL MENTION ONCE FOR ALL THAT THE DESCRIPTION WAS TAKEN FROM THE SUBJECT AS IT LAY UPON ITS BACK THOSE PARTS BEING CALLED HIGHEST WHICH WERE NEAREST THE HEAD THOSE LOWEST WHICH WERE NEAREST THE TAIL THOSE POSTE RIOR WHICH WERE NEAREST THE BACK AND THOSE ANTERIOR NEAREST THE BELLY B THE LACTEALS ACCOMPANY THE BLOODVESSELS UPON THE MESENTERY RUNNING BY THEIR SIDES AND COMMUNICATE FREQUENTLY ACROSS THOSE VESSELS NEAR THE ROOT OF THE MESENTERY THEY ANASTOMOSE SO AS TO FORM A NETWORK FROM WHICH SEVERAL LARGE BRANCHES GO INTO SOME CON SIDERABLE LYMPHATICS LYING ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SPINE A IN A CROCODILE WHICH I LATELY SAW BY THE FAVOUR OF MR JOHN HUNTER THE CHYLE WAS WHITE B THE ANIMAL FROM WHICH I TOOK THIS DESCRIPTION WAS LARGE MEASURING FROM THE LOWER TO THE UPPER PART OF THE SHELL TWO FEET SEVEN INCHES AND TWO FEET TWO INCHES FROM SIDE TO SIDE THESE200 THESE LAST CAN BE TRACED DOWNWARDS ALMOST TO THE ANUS AND BELONG TO THE PARTS SITUATED BELOW THE ME SENTERY AND PARTICULARLY TO THE KIDNEYS AT THE ROOT OF THE MESENTERY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE SPINE THE LYMPHATICS OF THE SPLEEN JOIN THE LACTEALS AND IMMEDIATELY ABOVE THIS UNION A SORT OF PLEXUS OR NET WORK IS FORMED WHICH LIES UPON THE RIGHT AORTA FOR THERE ARE TWO AORTOE IN THIS ANIMAL FROM THIS PLEXUS A LARGE BRANCH ARISES WHICH PASSES BEHIND THE RIGHT AORTA TO THE LEFT SIDE AND GETS BEFORE THE LEFT AORTA WHERE IT ASSISTS IN FORMING A VERY LARGE RECEPTA CULUM WHICH LIES UPON THAT ARTERY FROM THIS RECEP TACULUM ARISE THE THORACIC DUCTS FROM ITS RIGHT SIDE GOES ONE TRUNK WHICH IS JOINED BY THAT LARGE BRANCH WHICH CAME FROM THE PLEXUS TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE RIGHT AORTA AND THEN PASSES OVER THE SPINE THIS TRUNK IS THE THORACIC DUCT OF THE RIGHT SIDE FOR HAV ING GOT TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE SPINE IT RUNS UPWARDS ON THE INSIDE OF THE RIGHT AORTA TOWARDS THE RIGHT SUB CLAVIAN VEIN AND WHEN IT HAS ADVANCED A LITTLE ABOVE THE LUNGS OR WITHIN THREE OR FOUR INCHES OF THE SUBCLAVIAN VEIN IT DIVIDES INTO BRANCHES WHICH NEAR THE SAME PLACE ARE JOINED BY A LARGE BRANCH THAT COMES UP ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE AORTA FROM THIS PART UPWARDS THOSE VESSELS DIVIDE AND SUBDIVIDE AND ARE AFTERWARDS JOINED BY THE LYMPHATICS OF THE NECK WHICH LIKEWISE DIVIDE INTO BRANCHES BEFORE THEY JOIN THOSE FROM BELOW SO THAT BETWEEN THE THORACIC DUCT AND THE LYMPHATICS OF THE SAME SIDE OF THE NECK A VERY INTRICATE NETWORK IS FORMED FROM THIS NET WORK A BRANCH GOES INTO THE ANGLE MADE BY THE JU GULAR VEIN AND THE LOWER PART OR TRUNK OF THE SUBCLA VIAN THIS BRANCH THEREFORE LIES ON THE INSIDE OF THE JUGULAR201 JUGULAR WHILST ANOTHER GETS TO THE OUTSIDE OF THAT VEIN AND SEEMS TO OPEN INTO IT A LITTLE ABOVE THE ANGLE BETWEEN THAT VEIN AND THE SUBCLAVIAN I SAY SEEMS TO OPEN FOR THE INJECTION HAS NOT SUCCEEDED AT THIS PART SO AS TO ENABLE ME TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE LASTMENTIONED BRANCH REALLY DID ENTER OR NOT INTO THE ABOVEMENTIONED RECEPTACULUM THE LYMPHATICS OF THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM LIKEWISE ENTER THOSE OF THE DUODENUM RUN BY THE SIDE OF THE PANCREAS AND PRO BABLY RECEIVE ITS LYMPHATICS AND A PART OF THOSE OF THE LIVER THE LYMPHATICS OF THE STOMACH AND DUODENUM HAVE VERY NUMEROUS ANASTOMOSES AND FORM A BEAUTIFUL NETWORK ON THE ARTERY WHICH THEY ACCOMPANY FROM THIS RECEPTACULUM LIKEWISE BESIDES THE TRUNK ALREADY MENTIONED WHICH GOES TO THE RIGHT SIDE ARISE TWO OTHER TRUNKS PRETTY EQUAL IN SIZE ONE OF WHICH RUNS UPON THE LEFT SIDE AND THE OTHER UPON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE LEFT AORTA TILL THEY COME WITHIN TWO OR THREE INCHES OF THE LEFT SUBCLAVIAN VEIN WHERE THEY JOIN BEHIND THE AORTA AND FORM A NUMBER OF BRANCHES WHICH ARE AFTERWARDS JOINED BY THE LYMPHATICS OF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NECK SO THAT HERE A NETWORK OR PLEXUS IS FORMED AS UPON THE RIGHT SIDE FROM THIS PLEXUS A BRANCH ISSUES WHICH OPENS INTO THE ANGLE BE TWEEN THE JUGULAR AND THE LOWER PART OR TRUNK OF THE SUBCLAVIAN VEIN IN THESE NETWORKS FORMED BY THE LYMPHATICS NEAR THEIR TERMINATIONS IN THE VEINS THIS SYSTEM IN THE TURTLE LIKEWISE DIFFERS REMARKABLY FROM THAT IN BIRDS SO MUCH FOR THE GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE LYMPHA TIC SYSTEM IN THIS ANIMAL I SHALL NEXT ADD WHAT I HAVE OBSERVED AS TO THE MORE MINUTE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS LACTEALS IN THE FIRST PLACE IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT VOL LIX D D WHAT202 WHAT KNOWLEDGE WE HAVE OF THE MINUTE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE VESSELS IN QUADRUPEDS HAS BEEN ACQUIRED FROM EXAMINING THEM WHEN FILLED WITH THEIR NATURAL FLUID THE CHYLE FOR THE VALVES WITH WHICH THOSE VESSELS ABOUND PREVENT OUR INJECTING THEIR SMALLER BRANCHES AS WE DO THOSE OF THE ARTERIES AND VEINS OF THE IN TESTINES BUT IN THIS ANIMAL I HAVE BEEN SO FORTU NATE AS TO FORCE THE VALVES AND TO INJECT THE LACTEALS FROM THEIR TRUNKS TO THEIR BRANCHES SO AS TO FILL THEM ALL AROUND WITH QUICKSILVER IN SEVERAL PARTS OF THE IN TESTINE IN THESE EXPERIMENTS I OBSERVED THAT THE QUICKSILVER WAS OFTEN STOPPED BY THE VALVES WHERE THE LACTEALS RUN UPON THE MESENTERY OR WHERE THEY ARE JUST LEAVING THE INTESTINE BUT WHEN THOSE VALVES WERE FORCED AND THE QUICKSILVER HAD ONCE GOT UPON THE SURFACE OF THE GUT IT GENERALLY RAN FORWARD WITHOUT SEEMING TO MEET WITH ANY OBSTACLE THE LACTEALS ANASTOMOSE UPON THE INTESTINES SO THAT THE QUICK SILVER WHICH HAS GOT UPON THEM BY ONE VESSEL IN GE NERAL RETURNS BY ANOTHER AT SOME DISTANCE THE LARGER LACTEALS WHICH RUN UPON THE INTESTINES AC COMPANY THE BLOODVESSELS BUT THE SMALLER LACTEALS NEITHER ACCOMPANY THOSE VESSELS NOR PASS IN THE SAME DIRECTION BUT RUN LONGITUDINALLY UPON THE GUT AND DIP DOWN THROUGH THE MUSCULAR COAT INTO THE CELLULAR OR NERVOUS AS IT HAS BEEN CALLED WHICH IN THIS ANI MAL IS VERY THIN IN COMPARISON TO WHAT IT IS IN THE HUMAN SUBJECT SO FAR I HAVE TRACED THOSE VESSELS TO MY SATISFACTION BUT WHAT BECOMES OF THEM AFTER THEY HAVE GOT TO THE CELLULAR COAT IS NOT SO EASY TO DETER MINE IN FIVE OR SIX DIFFERENT EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAVE MADE THE MERCURY PASSED FROM THE LACTEALS INTO THE CELLS BETWEEN THE MUSCULAR COAT AND THE INTERNAL AND203 AND SPREAD FROM CELL TO CELL VERY UNIFORMLY OVER A GREAT PART OF THE INTESTINE ALTHOUGH BUT LITTLE FORCE HAD BEEN USED AND ALTHOUGH THERE WAS NOTHING LIKE EXTRAVASATION IN ANY OTHER PART OF THE INTESTINE UP ON INVERTING THE INTESTINE AFTER THUS FILLING ITS LACTEALS THE MERCURY ON BEING PRESSED WAS IN MANY PARTS DRIVEN INTO SMALL VESSELS UPON THE INTERNAL COAT OR VILLOUS AS IT IS CALLED FROM THIS IT WOULD SEEM THAT THIS CELLULAR NETWORK WAS A PART OF THE LYMPHA TIC SYSTEM IN THIS ANIMAL IT MIGHT INDEED BE SUP POSED TO BE MERE EXTRAVASATION BUT THAT IT IS RATHER A PART OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM APPEARS PROBABLE FROM THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS FIRST FROM THE REGU LARITY IN THE SIZE OF THE CELLS SECONDLY FROM THE LITTLE FORCE USED IN THE EXPERIMENT AND FROM THERE BEING NOTHING LIKE THIS APPEARANCE IN THE CELLULAR MEMBRANE BETWEEN THE PERITONEAL AND MUSCULAR COATS WHERE EXTRAVASATIONS WERE AS LIKELY TO HAPPEN THIRDLY FROM MY HAVING BEEN ABLE AFTER INVERTING THE INTESTINE TO PRESS THE QUICKSILVER FROM THE CELLS INTO THE VERY SMALL VESSELS UPON THE INTERNAL COAT BUT I MUST CONFESS THESE FACTS WOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE CELLS WERE OR WERE NOT A PART OF THE SYSTEM DID NOT THE ANALOGY OF THE SAME PART IN FISH CLEARLY PROVE IT FOR IN THE COD INSTEAD OF THE CELLULAR NETWORK AS IN THE TURTLE THERE IS A NET WORK OF VESSELS OF WHICH A DESCRIPTION SHALL BE GIVEN HEREAFTER SO THAT I HAVE NOW NO DOUBT BUT THAT THOSE CELLS ARE PARTS OF THE LYMPHATIC SYSTEM AND THAT THE SMALL ABSORBENT VESSELS OF THE INTERNAL COAT POUR THEIR FLUID INTO THIS NETWORK FROM WHICH IT IS CONVEYED BY THE LARGER LACTEALS D D 2 XXIX AN

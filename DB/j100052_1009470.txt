Sixth National Conference for Good City Government was held at Indianapolis on Wednesday Thursday and Friday November 30 December I and 2 I898 The discussions were grouped about the report of the Conimittee of Ten which had been appointed at the Louisville meeting in May I897 to formulate a municipal program which will embody the essential principles that must underlie successful municipal government and which shall also set forth a working plan or system consistent with American industrial and political conditions for putting such prin ciples into practical operation This committee of which Horace E Deming Esq of New York City was made chairman after a number of sessions finally agreed upon a charter and constitu tional amendment which in the opinion of the committee crys tallized the best experience of American and European municipal administration In order to formulate a charter adaptable to the great variety of conditions both as regards size and geographical situation it was necessary to restrict the charter to the fundamental principles of municipal organization This the committee was able to do with considerable success The result has been a framework of govern ment which should find ready acceptance in all portions of the country The essential features of the charter are as follows First A single chambered council elected on a general ticket for a term of six years onethird retiring from office every two years Second A mayor elected for a period of two years with power to appoint and remove heads of departments with the exception of city controller Third A city controller elected by the council As regards the educational department the committee recommends no changes in those cases in which the present system has proved satisfactory but points out that the independence of the school administration characteristic of many American cities has diverted from the city government some of the best energies of the community Provision is made in the charter for a wellorganized civil service and a system of auditing municipal accounts by some fiscal officer of state In the constitutional amendment the primary object which the committee has had in view has been to secure a large measure of 267126 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY home rule to the municipality It was recognized however that to place an absolute prohibition upon local and special legislation would probably create as many evils as it was intended to remedy The proposed amendment places all measures which are not made appli cable to all cities of the state in the category of special laws For these measures the affirmative vote of twothirds of all the mem bers of the legislature is required When passed by such majority legislation of this character does not become applicable to any city until it has received the formal approval of the legislative authority of such city within sixty days after the passage thereof by the state legislature or if within thirty days after the disapproval by the legislative authority of such city it shall again be passed by the affirmative vote of twothirds of all the members of the legislature which twothirds shall include threefourths of the members from districts outside of the city or cities to be affected Such a system will not prevent necessary legislation and will at the same time tend to safeguard local autonomy A striking feature of the amendment is the power given to municipalities with a population of twentyfive thousand or over to call local conventions for the purpose of framing a charter for the city a provision similar to that at present in operation in Missouri Washington and California It need hardly be said that such charter is subject to the constitution and laws of the state Another important departure from the legal principles which obtain thoughout the United States is recommended by the committee The courts have adopted the rule of narrow construction as regards the scope of municipal powers Unless a power is specifically granted or necessarily implied in the express grant or absolutely essential to the declared objects and purposes for which the municipal corporation is created the legal presumption is against the existence of such a power In the constitutional amendment the committee reverses this presumption by giving to the municipalities all powers of government subject to such limitations as may be contained in the constitutional laws of the state The sessions of the league were held in the rooms of the Commer cial Club At the first afternoon session the secretary Hon Clinton Rogers Woodruff of Philadelphia presented his annual report on The Advance of Municipal Reform in the United States at the same time the report of the Committee on Municipal Program was placed before the league On Wednesday evening a public meeting was held at which Hon William W Foulke of Richmond Ind and Samuel B Capen Esq president of the Boston Municipal League de livered addresses At the session Thursday morning December x 268NoTs ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT Horace E Deming Esq chairman of Committee on Municipal Pro gram read a paper on The Municipal Problem in the United States which was followed by a lively discussion At the after noon session Professor Frank J Goodnow of Columbia Univer sity presented a paper on The Place of the Council and Mayor in the Organization of Municipal GovernmentThe Necessity of Distin guishing Legislation from Administration On Thursday evening a banquet was tendered to the delegates by the Commercial Club The session of Friday morning December 2 was devoted to a paper on  The City of the United StatesThe Proper Scope of its Activities by Dr Albert Shaw of New York The afternoon session of the same day was occupied with the consideration of a paper by Mr Charles Richardson of Philadelphia on Municipal Franchises These four papers which constitute integral parts of the report of the Com mittee of Ten discussed in detail the general principals contained in the charter and amendment At the close of the meetings a resolu tion was adopted continuing the committee and directing them to present at the next meeting of the league a program for final action which may stand as the views of the league on the question of municipal organization WisconsinLeague of Wisconsin Municipalities One of the more recent movements in the field of municipal government is the formation of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities It is not a league of individuals but of municipalities Each city of the state is entitled to membership and is represented by its officers The league had its inception within the ranks of the mayors and aldermen of the cities of the state which augurs better things than if the pressure for im proved city government were confined to individuals in no manner connected with the active work of administration The program of the league is very comprehensive Its immediate attention will be directed to securing better charter legislation The cities of the state are beginning to feel the weight of accum ulated legislation in the form of special charters and of special amending acts Dissatisfaction with the general municipal law framed a few years ago has prevented its adoption as a whole by most of the cities while portions of it have been accepted only to add to the confusion that already existed The present plan of the league in connection with the Milwaukee Municipal League is to ask the present legislature to pass some minor legislation and to provide for a commission to frame a general law to be presented at the next session of the legislature two years hence It is intended to push the Communication of Dr Samuel E Sparling of the University of Wisconsin secretary of the league 269 127ANNALS OF THB AMERICAN ACADEMY model charter proposed at the Indianapolis Conference The league proposes to establish a bureau of information under the direction of the secretary The officers of the cities are beginning to feel the necessity of more intelligent consideration of the problems with which they must deal Semiannual conventions for the discussion of problems of current interest will be held The bureau of information expects to issue a bulletin at intervals as the organ of the league as well as to compile useful data in the form of reports In this way it is hoped to stimulate a more active public interest in the government of the cities of the state Iowa League of MunicipalitiesIn October 1898 the League of Iowa Municipalities was formed The proceedings of the first session have now been published It contains a series of papers dealing with various practical municipal questions One of the most important and interesting of these is a discussion of municipal owner ship of municipal service plants by Professor Isaac A Loos of the State University of Iowa Professor Loos discusses the possible relation between the municipality and quasipublic services and is led to the conclusion that whatever system may be adopted strict public regulation of private corporations is necessary Greater New YorkMayors Message The annual message of the Mayor of Greater New York to the municipal assembly is devoted mainly to a consideration of the financial situation of the consolidated city The total gross funded debt of the new city is 343269 2784 Deducting the sinking fund leaves a net funded debt of 244212835 97 At the present time the exact amount of the debt of the city has not as yet been determined owing to litigation which is pending as to the amount of the debt of the county of Queens to be assumed by the city of New York Owing to the fact that the city has actually passed its constitutional debtlimit the execution of needed public im provemlents has been greatly hampered Fortunately the assessment for I899 has been increased sufficiently to give to the city some leeway in contracting further indebtedness Taxes and Assessmentst The enormous annual budget of 93000000 has made it necessary to increase both the tax valuations and the tax rate The valuations of real estate in the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx which comprise the former city of New York have been increased by more than 400000000 and it is probable that the tax rate will be about 260  President Hon John MacVicker Mayor of Des Moines Secretary Hon T F Pierce Mayor of Marshalltown t Communication of James W Pryor Esq Secretary of the City Reform Club New York City 270 128NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT Increase in Salaries of Municipal Officers During December and January a general increase in the salaries of persons employed in the city departments was announced The recent action in raising salaries coming at the very moment when the increased valuations and tax rate emphasize the great cost of the new consolidated gov ernment has made a distinctly bad impression New Building Code Under the Greater New York charter the municipal assembly was empowered to appoint a commission of experts  to draft and submit to the assembly a new building code for the city A strenuous effort was made in behalf of several organiza tions to induce the assembly to exercise this power in such a way that the city might secure a building code designed to benefit the community The commission which has now been appointed how ever is composed of men who are in no sense experts on building law When the commission reports an effort will be made to prevent the adoption of provisions inimical to the public interests Street Cleaning Department It has become evident that the street cleaning department has quite fallen away from the standards set up by Colonel Waring The newspapers and the citizens generally agree that the streets are now cleaned but little better than before Colonel Waring demonstrated that the streets could be kept clean Physicians find interesting and conclusive evidence of this condition of the streets in the marked increase in those diseases of the respiratory organs which seemed to be disappearing before the efforts of the department under an efficient and honest head Metropolitan Street Railway Company The Metropolitan Company has recently acquired the Edison Electric Illuminating Company the largest producer of electric current in the city and the Edison Elec tric Illuminating Company of Brooklyn The apparent intention is to control the entire output of electric current in the city and to secure a monopoly of street franchises for that purpose Legislation designed to assist in carrying out this plan is being framed PhiladelphiaFiltration A recent report of the Director of the Department of Public Works submitted to councils deals with the filtration of the water supply The subject is one which has been before councils for several years but has not been acted upon owing partly to the enormous expense of filtering all the water in a city in which two hundred and sixty gallons per capita per day are consumed According to the directors estimate it would cost 2052837 to filter a quantity sufficient to furnish one hundred gallons per capita per day but if a plant to meet the present consumption is 27I 129130 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY to be constructed the expenditure would exceed 6oooooo The director seems uncertain as to the exact system of filtration which should be adopted but recommends that an experimental plant be erected at a cost of about 250000 The water supply of the city at the present time is of a quality which makes speedy action of some kind imperative Otherwise the citizens may expect a further in crease in the ravages of typhoid fever and similar diseases MassachusettsMletropolitan Water Board The third annual report of the Metropolitan Water Board gives an interesting account of a work of municipal cooperation which is introducing a new administrative form into our system of local government With the increasing density of population the interdependence of contiguous cities and towns is receiving growing emphasis This together with the similarity of problems and interests necessarily leads to some sort of understanding as to methods of public improvement and usually to active cooperation in the execution of public works We find numerous instances of metropolitan park districts metropolitan police districts and to these metropolitan drainage and water districts may now be added The advantages of such cooperation both as regards efficiency and economy are so great that it is surpris ing to find the movement delayed as long as it has been The record of the work of the Massachusetts commission clearly shows that under such a plan small communities may obtain an abundant and healthful supply of good water at a comparatively low cost The present board was created under the Metropolitan Water Act of 1895 which made it the duty of the board to construct maintain and operate a system of water works in accordance with plans and recommendations per mitted by the state board of health in that year and the board was required to provide a sufficient supply of pure water for the cities of Boston Chelsea Everett Maiden Medford Upton and Somerville and the towns of Belmont Hyde Park Melrose Revere Watertown and Winthrop The act further requires that the other cities and towns any part of which may be within ten miles of the state house shall be admitted into the metropolitan water district on such payment of money as the board shall determine and also provides for supplying water to water companies owning pipes and water systems in towns within said ten miles and for permitting the board to furnish water to still other cities and towns and water companies For the purpose of carrying out the provisions of the act the legislature authorized an issue of bonds to the extent of 27oooooo During the three years of the boards existence nearly 9oooo0o have been expended The plan is to construct a dam and storage reservoir upon the south branch of the Nashua river to take the waters of that river 272NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT and divert them into the Sudbury system in the city of Boston and to make the waters of the south branch of the Nashua river in connection with the waters of the Cochituate and Sudbury systems available for the whole metropolitan district for its future water sup ply The plan when carried out will give to Boston and surround ing districts a water supply unlimited in quantity and of a high standard of purity BostonRapid Transit The fourth annual report of the Boston Rapid Transit Commission contains a detailed description of the sub way up to the period of its completion It is interesting to note that while the estimated cost was 5oooooo it is probable that the work will be completed at a cost of 4250000 The subway is now in operation and has relieved the congestion of traffic in the central portions of the city In a previous number of the ANNALS  the con ditions of the contract for the use of the subway by the West End Street Railway Company were discussed Municipal Statistics The Commission of Municipal Statistics of Boston has just recently issued the second volume of the series relating to the finances of the city containing a classification of ordinary revenue between 1892 and 1896 Subsequent volumes will treat of the pro ceeds of loans and other extraordinary receipts trust funds and book keeping items Thus a complete picture of the history of Boston municipal finances will be presented Clevelandt unicipal Lighting Plant The question of public ownership of lighting plants is receiving a great deal of attention in Cleveland it being greatly favored by Mayor McKisson who points to the municipal water works plant which earns some 400ooo annu ally over and above all expenses besides furnishing free water for city purposes as an example of what can be done Election of County Commissioners Since the last communication to the ANNALS the friends of better government in Cleveland have received an encouraging demonstration of the independence of the better class of voters and their refusal to be bound by party lines when convinced of the incompetency of a candidate At the Novem ber elections one of the officers to be elected was a county commis sioner and under the Crawford County plan of direct primaries and through the influence of the party machine the present incumbent in office was renominated by the Republican party In September last charges of false classification and improper esti mates were brought to the attention of the Municipal Association in  See Notes on Municipal Government Vol xii page 445 Nov 1898 t Communication of Frederic C Howe Esq 273 I3I132 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the grading and improving of a county road known as the Brecks ville Turnpike The association employed expert engineers who thoroughly examined the road and reported that gross carelessness or actual fraud characterized almost every dollar expended in the improv ment while the road itself cost from 15ooo to 20000 more than was justified and about four times the original estimated cost This matter was brought to the attention of the taxpayers in two bulletins issued by the association While the bulletins made no accusations the inferences were so plain that the Common Pleas judges directed the grand jury to investigate the matter and indict the officials if corruption was found to exist as charged The latter proceeding came to nothing however Just prior to the election however the Municipal Association repeated its charges despite the action of the grand jury while one of the local papers earnestly enlisted itself in the same cause The opposing candidate nominated by the Democratic party had little to commend him as an official but despite this fact the public placed sufficient confidence in the recommendation of the Municipal Associa tion to follow its leadership The Republican candidate was defeated by over 7000 votes falling behind the other Republican candidates by about I4000 The result was chiefly gratifying as showing the grow ing independence of voters from the whip of party conventions and their willingness to place the stamp of disapproval upon official cor ruption when light is furnished on the subject Close upon the heels of the disclosures in county affairs have come similar reports from an investigating committee of the council of the work of the street cleaning department in this city This committee recently reported that there existed a system of false classification for streetcleaning by which the city was defrauded of thousands of dol lars The city council which is very much improved in its personnel over previous councils seems to have taken the matter in hand and the public is waiting further developments with great interest Street Railways In our last communication it was stated that an ordinance had been introduced in the council with a view to reduc ing fares on street railway lines to four cents Since then this ordinance has been passed with an amendment compelling the roads to sell seven tickets for a quarter with a single fare of four cents The ordinance as passed applies to but two lines of the consolidated system one being a portion of the Cleveland City Railway Company and the other a portion of the Cleveland Electric Railway A few days before the ordinance was to have gone into effect the railroads began injunction proceedings in the federal courts and obtained a temporary restraining order enjoining the city from enforcing the 274NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT ordinances In this petition the roads set forth their financing of the past fifteen years in considerable detail and alleged that this reduction in fare would bankrupt the roads and render it impossible to continue operation ToledoMayors Mlessage The annual message of the Mayor of Toledo contains a lively discussion of a number of important munici pal problems and recommends a very wide extension of municipal powers The first of these recommendations relates to the establish ment of a city lighting plant which plan can be carried out at com paratively small cost inasmuch as the city is already in possession of a pipe line which was constructed some years ago for the purpose of supplying natural gas The mayor recommends that gas for lighting and heating purposes be furnished to the inhabitants at actual cost The establishment of a municipal electric light plant is also strongly advocated on the ground that the city is now paying ninety dollars per year for each arc light whereas under municipal operation the cost would not exceed sixty dollars In six or seven years the sav ing in cost of light alone would pay for the plant A significant portion of the message is the comment on the Board of Education Under a law which abolished the ward as a political division for the care of schools and created a Board of Education rep resenting the city at large the result has been that the interests of the city as a whole are now considered whereas formerly the time and energy of the board was wasted in endeavoring to harmonize conflict ing interests of the different wards The mayor strongly condemns the contract system in the execution of public works and recommends a system of direct employment of labor by the municipality MilwaukeeCharter Revision There is promise of advanced charter legislation in the State of Wisconsin The movement began some time ago and has been much accelerated since the Indianapolis Convention of the National Municipal League two years ago Full reports of the provisions of the new charter framed by the Committee of ten of the National Municipal League were published by the Milwaukee Sentinel and renewed attention directed to the subject of charter legislation After the Indianapolis Conference the Municipal League of Milwaukee called a state conference of mayors of leading Wisconsin cities which met on the fifth and sixth of January at Milwaukee A joint committee of the Milwaukee Municipal League and of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities was appointed pursuant to a resolution by the president of the Municipal League who was also Communication of John A Butler Esq President Milwaukee Municipal League 275 I33I34 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY chairman of the conference with power to draft necessary legislation on the basis of the new charter or to ask for the appointment of a charter commission The result was that the appointment of a charter commission will be asked of the present legislature to report to the next legislature on general charter revision and a bill will be introduced during the present legislative session extensively amend ing the charter of Milwaukee and probably the charters of the larger Wisconsin cities It is reasonable to expect therefore that the pro visions of the charter published by the National Municipal League will soon be in operation in Wisconsin cities Kansas CityStreet Railway Franchises The Supreme Court of Missouri  has just handed down one of the most important decisions of recent years relating to the question of municipal franchises The effect of the decision upon the powers of municipalities to demand a return for franchises will if generally accepted throughout the country be of farreaching influence In April I895 the legislature of Missouri passed an act requiring that all street railway gas water or electric light or other franchises should be sold at public auction to the bidder who will give the largest percentage yearly of the gross receipts derived from the occupation and use of their property pro vided that such payment in any case shall be not less than two per cent of the gross earnings during the first five years of such occupation and use and thereafter for each period of five years such percentage shall be increased to correspond with the increase of value of the property occupied Kansas City granted a franchise to a street rail way company without inserting these conditions in the franchise grant The attorneygeneral of the city thereupon filed an informa tion charging that the street railway company was unlawfully usurping the franchise and operating a street railway system without the necessary authority In considering the provisions of the law above alluded to the court lays down the rule that an act of the legislature to be enforceable as a law must prescribe a rule of action and such rule of action must be intelligently expressed If a statute is incapable of construction and interpretation it will be inoperative and void Taking up the provisions of the act the court goes on to say that it is utterly impossible to give this act any reasonable or sensible con struction as applied to railroads If it means that the company must pay at least two per cent of its entire gross earnings for the first five years to be subsequently increased to each municipality through whose streets it may be built and to each county whose highways it  Supreme Court of Missouri November i6 I898 276NOTES ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT may cross the railway company in many instances will be compelled to pay more than its total receipts for the right to build its road over the highways and through the cities along its way And if as some of the council suggest the percentage should be computed only upon the gross receipts of that part of the road located upon the streets of the city or across the highways then we are met by the fact that there is no method provided if it is possible to suggest one by which the actual receipts of that particular part of the road can be ascertained Such rates will not necessarily be in the same proportion to the entire earnings as the length of the road upon the highways or streets may be to the entire length of said railroad Furthermore the court considers it quite impracticable to subdivide a continuous line of railroad so as to permit competition for the privilege of constructing and operating separately the portions lying within the municipalities upon its route The same reasoning applies to the existence of telegraph and telephone lines gas works water works etc Another difficulty which the court encounters is the fact that the law contemplates a percentage of gross earnings from the use of the franchise that is to say from the occupation of public property It is quite impossible however to separate by any method of accounting the receipts from this element of capital invested from that of the power houses machinery etc In summing up the court says that this attempt at legislation involves a method of calculating compensation which is uncertain and incapable of reasonably accurate construction and interpretation and is therefore void At bottom the difficulty here involved is one which is due to the recent development of the electric railway and to the rapid growth of monopolies in the quasipublic services Street railways are no longer matters of a purely local concern but are rapidly outgrowing the limits of the local divisions Thus in many of our states particu larly in New England a single street railway company will run through a dozen or more municipalities The decision of the Supreme Court of Missouri is one of the first indications of the difficulties which are certain to increase with each year in adjusting the fran chise taxes to be levied on such companies FOREIGN CITIES LondonStreet Railways During I898 a number of franchises of street railway companies have expired which has given the County Council an opportunity to apply the principle of public ownership which it has so long advocated The franchise grants provide that at the expiration of the term the public authorities should have the right to purchase the lines at an appraised value Already in 1896 the council 277 I35136 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY acquired under this plan the lines of the North Metropolitan and the London Street Trainways companies Both of these lines together with those purchased from the London Street Company in 1895 were leased in I896 to the North Metropolitan Company for a period of fourteen years The council was required to pay the actual value of the property that is of the tracks buildings and rollingstock This amounted to nearly 3900000 799476 Under the terms of the lease the company pays into the public treasury first a fixed rental of 225000 a year second 5 per cent on the amount expended by the council in the purchase of the road and third I2Y per cent on the increase of gross receipts from the whole of the companys system both within and outside the county over those of the year ending December 3I I895 In 1897 the council purchased a portion of the London Tramway Companys line The renlainder of the companys system became purchasable by the council on the tenth of August 1898 the twenty eight years from the granting of the franchise August io I870 having expired Although the council is not operating these lines directly it is gradually acquiring the ownership of the street railway system which under a system of leasing to private companies enables it to maintain complete control over its highways Report on Street Railway TractionThis reportt printed by the order of the highways committee of the London County Council is the result of an inspection of the conditions of street railway traction in the United States and on the continent of Europe To Americans the report offers but little in the way of information the major part of the data being taken from our own experience The report after briefly discussing street railway traction by means of steam oil motors gas compressed air and cable comes to the conclusion that in solving the problem of our tramways we must look to some form of electric traction The advantages of electric traction are to be found in the greater cleanliness comfort and high average rate of speed it allows in the ease with which speed direction and number of cars may be regulated and above all in the increased economy at least as compared with horse traction The report points to the rapid extension of electric street railways in the United States While the mileage of cable lines increased from 5Io to 539 miles in the six Communication of Dr Walter E Weyl Senior Fellow in Political Economy University of Pennsylvania t London County Council  Tramway Traction Report on some forms of Me chanical Tramway Traction that have been tried and more or less successfully worked in various towns and cities in England on the continent of Europe and in America By J Allen Barker London King  Son x89899 i shilling 278NoTEs ON MUNICIPAL GOVERNMENT years from I89I to 1897 the steam tramways decreased from 604 to 467 miles and the horse car lines from 5400 to 959 miles the length of American street railways operated by electricity increased from 2523 to I4263 miles The report draws attention to the great in crease of traffic in such cities as Bridgeport New Orleans Brooklyn Columbus Pittsburg Washington etc due to the installation of an electric street railway plant and further compares the street railway mileage of American Continental and other British cities with that of London As far as we are able to judge the report appears to have committed the error of comparing track mileage in some cases with street mileage in others a more correct comparison however would also show the greater extent to which American cities are provided with street railways The comparison as to the maximum distance which may be ridden for a given fare shows that here also the advantage is on the side of American street railways In the twelve representative American cities considered the passenger might ride from ten to eighteen miles for five cents while in Dublin five pence ten cents were charged for eight miles and in Manchester the fare rose to sixteen cents eight pence The report does not approve of the adoption of the American policy of uniform fares  for London but considers that longdistance fares might be materially lessened and the system of transfers be adopted ParisMunicipal Fire Insurance A special commission of the municipal council has recently presented an interesting report on municipal insurance The commission proposes to establish a muni cipal fire insurance institute in which every citizen may if he desires insure at a reasonable rate In a number of foreign cities this plan has been carried out particularly in Berlin where a system of com pulsory insurance exists every property holder being compelled to insure in the municipal fund The Paris commission proposes how ever to allow the individual free choice in the matter but hopes that the lower rates which the city will be able to offer will be sufficient inducement to bring the great mass of property owners within the municipal system The report emphasizes the fact that the fire insurance companies make no contribution at the present time toward the maintenance of the fire department of the city which constitutes a heavy drain upon the citys income I37

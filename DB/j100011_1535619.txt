polychaetous annelids made by the U S F C steamer Albatross in the Hawaiian Islands in I902 and sent me for study were large numbers of a heteronereid which by means of the general character of the head the presence of a peculiar hookshaped seta in the anterior parapodia and especi ally from the form of the paragnathi I have identified as the abovementioned species Externally the bodies of both male and female individuals show very clearly the distinction between  modified  posterior and  unmodified anterior somites characteristic of this sexual phase of Nereis the modifications following in general the usual direction i e a broadening and flattening of all parapodial lobes and a replacement of the ordinary form of seta by one with a very broad flat terminal joint A constant external sex differ ence is found in the male in the dorsal cirri of somites 27 Beginning with somite 2 the dorsal cirrus is larger than in the female and on successive somites as far as the seventh there is a gradual increase in the size of this organ until on the seventh it is very prominent composed of a thick cylindrical basal portion with a broad flattened tip ending in an acute point This con dition is similar to that of the form described by Verrill under the name of Nectonereis1 On the eighth somite there is an abrupt change to the ordinary form of cirrus Internally extensive modifications appear On a surface view of a mature female one sees that the whole body anterior un modified  as well as posterior  modified  region is crowded with eggs seeming not to be isolated in somites but packed together in a continuous cavity That the transverse septe are actually 1Published by permission of Hon George M Bowers United States Commis sioner of Fisheries 2 Verrill A E Invertebrates of

moved from one somite to another or through several somites Dissection and the study of transverse sections confirm these conclusions By the loss of the transverse septe the whole interior of the body has been transformed into a continuous thin walled sac filled with ova from one end to the other No trace of ovaries could be found and owing to the poor preservation of the material nothing definite can be said concerning the histol ogy of the internal organs but there is every indication of a con siderable amount of degeneration While the pharynx retains  Q  int nte FIG i Section through anterior region of body of female X 24 ov ova bz blood vessel  int intestine  ner ventral nerve cord its normal condition the intestine appears on gross dissection as a mere thread and anteriorly the thin transparent body wall lacking most of its usual muscle layers is very noticeable Fig I is from a transverse section through the anterior end of the body thus through the  unmodified region The body wall with the magnification employed appears as a mere line with the thin layer of longitudinal muscle fibers showing as rows of dots just inside it These muscle fibers are more or less broken away from the rest of the wall but I cannot tell how much of this is due to actual degeneration and how much to defective preservation and faulty microtome technique A smallA L TREADWELL break in the dorsal wall is apparently due to the latter The intestine int Fig i shows in the section as a minute tube in whose walls no definite cellular structure could be seen In many sections I could find no trace of the intestine While this may possibly be due to the technique I do not think that they could have dropped out of so many sections and believe that there was an actual disappearance Such a condition with respect to the intestine is not unusual among annelids at the breeding season Ventrally is the section of the nerve cord and on the right a part of the parapodium is seen The parapodial muscle bands are very feebly developed As shown in Fig I large numbers of ova are present in the body cavity These fill the whole cavity extending forward into the head so that as is shown in Fig 5 a section through the in ne FiG 2 Section through posterior region of same individual as in Fig i X 24 sp spermatozoa adhering to surface other letters as before eye shows at the same time an ovum contained in a cavity between the muscles of the head That this condition is usual can be seen by careful surface examination of the entire annelid The ova appear to have a very dense outer layer with vacuolated interior containing a nucleus As it is impossible to tell how much of this apparent structure is an artefact I have represented it only in a very diagrammatic fashion in Fig i while in Figs 2 and 5 I have drawn merely the outlines of the ova Scattered among the ova are many sections of connective tissue 228HETERONEREIS STAGE OF NEREIS KOBIENSIS MCINTOSH 229 and blood vessels bvy Fig i indicating that loose strands of this tissue carrying vessels still persist In the posterior portion of the body the socalled  modified region similar conditions hold with respect to the septae and intestine but the body wall is very noticeably thicker its muscle layers being very well developed This is easily seen by reference to Fig 2 which is a section through a posterior somnite of the annelid drawn in Fig I The longitudinal band of muscle fibers is much more strongly developed and the oblique fibers espe cially those connected with the parapodia are vastly stronger than those in the anterior somites The difference in thickness of the body wall is especially well seen in a comparison of Fig 3 an enlarged camera drawing of the body wall at X in Fig I with Fig 4 a similar drawing of X of Fig 2 The dermal layer is FIG 3 Detail of ventral wall at FIG 4 Detail of ventral wall taken X in Fig I X 280 Im longi from the point 4 in Fig 2 X 280 tudinal muscle fibers seen in sec cut cuticle tion ep epidermis much thicker and the longitudinal band is relatively enormously developed It will be understood of course that the thickness of the muscle band is indicated by the entire diameter of the figure Owing to the irregular arrangement of the fibers no one of them extended through the bundle in a straight enough fashion to appear entire in a single section It is evident further that the arrangement in Fig 4 is more nearly a normal one than in Fig 3 so that the condition of the latter must be regarded as due to degeneration On either side Fig 2 shows a section of a parapodium that on the right containing an ovum in its cavity Similar conditions hold in the case of the male heteronereid The anterior  unmodified portion of the body is more or lessA L TREADWELL degenerate as regards its body wall muscles and intestine while the posterior modified region shows at least no degeneration of its muscle structure I am inclined to believe there has been a hypertrophy of these organs but nonsexual individuals are not available for comparison Spermatozoa are found all through the body from the prostomium backward At no place however does the intestine appear as degenerate as in the female This is especially true of the posterior region where the intestine is large filling nearly as much of the ccelom as it does in other annelids If the loss of the intestine has arisen in ft  o the female through mechanical reasons connected in any way with the accumu t  J tent lation of large numbers of ova around it vj Q  it is easy to see why the loss should be 5i5 greater in the female than in the male FIG 5 Section through Though present in large numbers the head of same individual X 24  eye ententacle spermatozoa would on account of their small size occupy much less room and exert much less pressure on surrounding organs than would the ova Many individuals contained no sex cells apparently having discharged them into the water That the sea water must have contained considerable numbers of sex cells is shown by the fact that numbers of spermatozoa are found in the sections adhering to the body of the female Fig 2 represents a number of sperm adhering to the outside of a lobe of the parapodium As shown above no sex organs were found It would be of a good deal of interest to know whether they were originally present throughout the body or are confined to the posterior  modified end The latter condition is much the more prob able Apparently in this annelid there is in the heteronereis phase a considerable degeneration of the anterior  unmodified  region the degeneration involving the internal organs and para podial muscles though not especially involving the external organs Into this thinwalled sack thus formed pass the sex cells which are now carried in it as well as in the posterior portions of the body while the posterior parapodia retain their normal muscular development and function as the main loco 230HETERONEREIS STAGE OF NEREIS KOBIENSIS McINTOSH 231 motor organs of the animal Whether the animal goes to pieces after the sex cells are thrown off or whether it subsequently regains its normal condition cannot be determined by the ma terial at my disposal VASSAR COLLEGE March 3 I905

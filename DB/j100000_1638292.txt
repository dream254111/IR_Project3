researches the importance of the problems he has at tacked We shall signalize the elegance and the simplicity of the methods the clearness of the exposition the solicitude for absolute rigor In seeking to be per fectly rigorous one risks at times being long and this is not to buy too dear a cor rectness without which mathematics would be nothing But Hilbert has known how to avoid the tedium of such diffuseness for his readers in never letting them lose from view the guiding thread which has served him to orient himself We always easily see by what chain of ideas he has been led to set himself a problem and find its solu tion We realize that more analyst than geom eter in the ordinary sense of the word he nevertheless has seen at one view the totality of his work before distinguishing details and he knows how to give his reader the advantage of this allembracing vision Hilbert has had a tremendous influence upon the recent progress of the mathe matical sciences not alone by his personal work but by his teaching by the counsel he has given to his scholars and which has enabled them to contribute in their turn to this development of our knowledge by using the methods created by their master There is no need so it seems to say more in justification of the decision of the com mission which has unanimously awarded to Hilbert the Bolyai prize for the period 19051909 M POINCARE THE WILLARD GIBBS MEDAL IN the early part of 1909 Mr William Con verse of Chicago proposed to the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society to found a gold medal to be awarded annually by the Section Mr Converse stated that the ob ject of his proposition was to stimulate in terest in the work of the Section and of the society at large and to encourage the highest ideals of the science in their members The Section gladly welcomed and accepted the offer made It was proposed to name the medal after the most eminent chemist Amer ica has given to the science and the consent of Mrs Van Name the surviving sister of Willard Gibbs having been secured the medal founded by Mr Converse was named the Wil lard Gibbs Medal After various plans had been suggested and discussed the Section de cided that the medal should be awarded an nually by invitation rather than by competi tion and the following rules were adopted for the award RULES FOR THE AWARD OF THE WILLARD GIBBS MEDAL FOUNDED BY WILLIAM A CONVERSE 1 A gold medal shall be awarded annually by the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society at its May meeting which meeting shall be open to the public The medal is to be known as the Willard Gibbs Medal founded by William A Converse The award shall be made according to the rules here set forth and made a part of the bylaws of the Chicago Section 2 The award shall be made by a twothirds vote of a jury of twelve to anybody who because of his eminent work in and original contributions to pure or applied chemistry is deemed worthy of special recognition by the jury 3 A condition of the award shall be that the recipient of the medal shall deliver an address upon a chemical subject of his own selection and satisfactory to the jury at the May meeting of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society He shall be notified of the award three months in advance of this meeting by the chair man of the Chicago Section 4 The jury of the award to be known as the Jury of the Willard Gibbs Medal shall consist of twelve members six of them to be members of the Chicago Section The chairman of the Chicago Section shall be chairman of the jury but shall have no vote 5 Four members of the jury shall be elected each year to serve three years in the same manner 808 SCIENCEMAY 26 1911 SCIENCE and at the same time as the officers of the Chicago Section At the first election of the jurors of the Willard Gibbs Medal to be held in 1911 four jurors shall be elected to serve a term of one year four to serve a term of two years and four to serve a term of three years Of each four elected two shall be from the Chicago Section 6 At the call of the chairman of the Chicago Section the jury shall begin its deliberation on January 2 of each year Each member of the jury shall be entitled to place in nomination the names of two candidates The voting shall then be on these candidates The four names receiving the highest number of votes on the first ballot shall be retained the others rejected If of the four names retained none receives a twothirds vote on the second ballot the two receiving the fewest votes shall be dropped If on further balloting the committee finds it impos sible to make a selection by a twothirds vote it will report to the section which will proceed to elect the recipient of the medal but if any candi date receives a twothirds vote of the committee his election shall be final and shall be so reported to the section 7 It is desired that the paper or address if suitable be published in one of the publications of the American Chemical Society 8 The executive committee of the Chicago Sec tion shall have the power to decide any question not specifically covered by these rules 9 The Chicago Section shall have the power to change or amend these rules in the same manner as the bylaws of the section For the first year of the foundation 1911 by special amendment of the rules of the Sec tion a special jury of award was elected con sisting of the following members S A Mather chfairman of the section and president of the ThorkildsenMather Co W Brady chief chemist of the Illinois Steel Co D K French secretary of the section and chemist of the Dearborn Drug and Chemical Co W Hoskins of Mariner and Hoskins Professor John H Long of the Northwestern Univer sity Medical School A Lowenstein chief chemist of Nelson Morris  Co Professor H McCormick of Armour Institute Professor H N McCoy of the University of Chicago W D Richardson chief chemist of Swift  Co Professor Alexander Smith of the Uni versity of Chicago and president of the American Chemical Society and Professor Julius Stieglitz of the University of Chi cago By a unanimous vote the jury decided to award the first medal to Professor Svante Arrhenius for his fundamental work on the theory of electrolytic dissociation The medal was presented to Dr Arrhenius on the evening of May 12 after a banquet which was attended by over 200 members and guests of the section The formal program of the evening included the following addresses International Bonds of Science by Harry Pratt Judson president of the University of Chicago Chemistry and Commerce by Mr Wheeler president of the Association of Commerce of Chicago The Willard Gibbs Medal by S A Mather chairman of the Chicago Section of the American Chemical Society The Presentation of the Willard Gibbs Medal to Dr Arrhenius by Alexander Smith president of the American Chemical Society and The Willard Gibbs Address by the medallist Svante Arrhenius on The Theory of Electrolytic Dissociation The last address gave in outline the history of the discovery of the theory of electrolytic disso ciation it formed on the one hand an in tensely interesting record of the birth of a great idea and theory of its early difficulties and its final triumph and on the other hand it presented a picture of the struggles progress and development of the genial discoverer of the theory The address will be published under the auspices of the Chicago Section of the Amer ican Chemical Society SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS DR SAMUEL H SCUDDER of Cambridge eminent for his

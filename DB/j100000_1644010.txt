POSITION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY IN GREAT BRITAIN1 FOR the third time in succession the Sec tion meets under the shadow of the war cloud but there is some slight consolation for the indescribable suffering and sorrow which have been imposed upon millions of our fellow creatures in the hope and belief that this cloud also may have a silver lin ing It is perhaps no exaggeration to say that nothing less than such an upheaval of existing habits and traditions as has been caused by the war would have sufficed to arouse the British nation from the state of apathy towards science with which it has been fatuously contented in the past Now however the sleeper has at least stirred in his slumber The press bears witness through the appearance of innumerable articles and letters that the people of this country and even the politicians have be gun to perceive the dangers which will in evitably result from a continuance of their former attitude and to understand that in peace as in war civilization is at a tremen dous disadvantage in the struggle for ex istence unless armed by science and that the future prosperity of the empire is ulti mately dependent upon the progress of sci ence and very specially of chemistry If as one result of the war our people are led to appreciate the value of scientific work then perhaps we shall not have paid too high a price high although the price must be As concerns our own branch of science 1 Address before the Chemical Section of the British Association for the Advancement of Sci ence NewcastleonTyne 1916N S VOL XLIV No 1135 we can not rest satisfied with anything less than full recognition of the fact that chem istry is a profession of fundamental im portance and that the chemist is entitled to a position in no respect inferior to that of a member of any of the other learned professions Reference to the annual reports of the association shows that former presidents of the Section have availed themselves to the full of the latitude permitted in the choice of a subject for their address and that some have even established the precedent of dis pensing with an address altogether On the present occasion a topic for discussion seems to be clearly indicated by the cir cumstances in which we stand because since the outbreak of the war chemists have been giving more earnest considera tion than before to the present position and future prospects of the chemical in dustry of this country It will therefore not be inappropriate if I touch upon some aspects of this question even although un able to add much to what is or ought to be common knowledge The period which has elapsed since the last meeting of the Section in Newcastle has witnessed truly remarkable progress in every branch of pure and applied chemis try For fully fifty years previous to that meeting the attention of the great majority of chemists had been devoted to organic chemistry but since 1885 or thereabouts whilst the study of the compounds of car bon has been pursued with unflagging energy and success it has no longer so largely monopolized the activities of in vestigators Interest in the other elements which had been to some extent neglected on account of the fascinations of carbon has been revived with the happiest results for not only has our knowledge of these ele ments been greatly extended but their number also has been notably increased by the discovery of two groups of simple sub stances possessed of new and remarkable propertiesthe inert gases of the argon family and the radioactive elements In addition the bonds between mathematics and physics on the one hand and chemis try on the other have been drawn closer with the effect that the department of our science known as physical chemistry has now assumed a position of firstrate impor tance With the additional light provided by the development and application of physicochemical theory and methods we are beginning to gain some insight into such intricate problems as the relation be tween physical properties and chemical constitution the structure of molecules and even of atoms and the mechanics of chem ical change our outlook is being widened and our conceptions rendered more precise Striking advances have also been made in other directions The extremely difficult problems which confront the biochemist are being gradually overcome thanks to the indefatigable labors of a band of highly skilled observers and the department of biological chemistry has been established on a firm footing through the encouraging results obtained within the period under review Further within the last few years many of our ideas have been subjected to a revolutionary change through the study of the radioactive elements those elusive sub stances which occur in such tantalizingly minute quantities and of which some ap pear so reluctant to exist in a free and in dependent state that they merge their identity in that of another and less retiring relative within an interval of time meas ured by seconds In truth if a Rip Van Winkle among chemists were to awake now after a slumber of thirty years his amaze ment on coming into contact with the chem istry of today would be beyond words The more purely scientific side of our sci ence can claim no monopoly in progress for applied chemistry in every department 436 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 has likewise advanced with giant strides mainly of course through the application of the results of scientific research to indus trial purposes An attempt to sketch in the merest outline the recent development of applied chemistry would I fear exhaust your patience but I may indicate in pass ing some of the main lines of advance Many of the more striking results in the field of modern chemical industry have been obtained by taking advantage of the powers we now possess to carry out opera tions economically both at very high and at very low temperatures and by the em ployment on the manufacturing scale of electrolytic and catalytic methods of pro duction Thanks largely to the invention of the dynamo the technologist is now able to utilize electrical energy both for the pro duction of high temperatures in the differ ent types of electric furnace and for elec trolytic processes of the most varied description Among the operations car ried out with the help of the electric fur nace may be mentioned the manufacture of graphite silicon and phosphorus of chromium and other metals of carbides silicides and nitrides and the smelting and refining of iron and steel Calcium carbide claims a prominent place in the list in the first place because of the ease with which it yields acetylene which is not only used as an illuminant and in the oxyacetylene burner as a means of producing a temper ature so high that the cutting and welding of steel is now a comparatively simple mat ter but also promises to serve as the start ingpoint for the industrial synthesis of acetaldehyde and many other valuable or ganic compounds Moreover calcium car bide is readily converted in the electric furnace into calcium cyanamide which is employed as an efficient fertilizer in place of sodium nitrate or ammonium sulphate and as a source of ammonia and of alkali cyanides Among the silicides carborun dum is increasingly used as an abrasive and a refractory material and calcium sili cide which is now a commercial product forms a constituent of some blasting ex plosives The Serpek process for the prep aration of alumina and ammonia by the formation of aluminium nitride from beauxite in the electric furnace and its sub sequent decomposition by caustic soda should also be mentioned Further the electric furnace has made possible the man ufacture of silica apparatus of all kinds both for the laboratory and the works and of alundum ware also used for operations at high temperature Finally the first step in the manufacture of nitric acid and of nitrites from air now in operation on a very large scale is the combustion of nitro gen in the electric arc In other industrial operations the high temperature which is necessary is obtained by the help of the oxyhydrogen or the oxy acetylene flame the former being used amongst other purposes in a small but I believe profitable industry the manufac ture of synthetic rubies sapphires and spinels Also within a comparatively re cent period advantage has been taken of the characteristic properties of aluminium now obtainable at a moderate price in the various operations classed under the head ing aluminothermy the most important being the reduction of refractory metallic oxides although of course thermite is use ful for the production of high temperatures locally The modern methods of liquefying gases which have been developed within the period under review have rendered pos sible research work of absorbing interest on the effect of very low temperatures on the properties and chemical activity of many substances and have been applied for instance in separating from one another the members of the argon family and in obtaining ozone in a state of prac SCIENCE 437N S VOL XLIV No 1135 tical purity Moreover industrial applica tions of these methods are not lacking amongst which I may mention the separa tion of nitrogen and oxygen from air and of hydrogen from watergasprocesses which have helped to make these elements available for economic use on the large scale Electrolytic methods are now extensively employed in the manufacture of both inor ganic and organic substances and older processes are being displaced by these mod ern rivals in steadily increasing number It is sufficient to refer to the preparation of sodium magnesium calcium and alumi num by electrolysis of fused compounds of these metals the refining of iron copper silver and gold the extraction of gold and nickel from solution the recovery of tin from waste tinplate the preparation of caustic alkalies and simultaneously of chlorine of hypochlorites chlorates and perchlorates of hydrosulphites of per manganates and ferricyanides of persul phates and percarbonates the regenera tion of chromic acid from chromium salts the preparation of hydrogen and oxygen As regards organic compounds we find chiefly in use electrolytic methods of re duction which are specially effective in the case of many nitro compounds and of oxi dation as for instance the conversion of anthracene into anthraquinone At the same time a number of other compounds for example iodoform are also prepared electrolytically Within recent years there have been great advances in the application of cata lytic methods to industrial purposes Some processes of this class have of course been in use for a considerable time for ex ample the Deacon chlorine process and the contact method for the manufacture of sulphuric acid whilst the preparation of phthalic anhydride largely used in the synthesis of indigo and other dyestuffs by the oxidation of naphthalene with sul phuric acid with the assistance of mercuric sulphate as catalyst is no novelty More recent are the contact methods of obtain ing ammonia by the direct combination of nitrogen and hydrogen and of oxidizing ammonia to nitric acidboth of which are said to be in operation on a very large scale in Germany The catalytic action of met als particularly nickel and copper is util ized in processes of hydrogenationfor ex ample the hardening of fats and of de hydrogenation as in the preparation of acetaldehyde from alcohol and such me tallic oxides as alumina and thoria can be used for processes of dehydratione g the preparation of ethylene or of ether from alcohol Other catalysts employed in industrial processes are titanous chloride in electrolytic reductions and cerous sul phate in electrolytic oxidations of carbon compounds gelatine in the preparation of hydrazine from ammonia sodium in the synthesis of rubber etc Other advances in manufacturing chem istry include the preparation of a number of the rarer elements and their compounds which were hardly known thirty years ago but which now find commercial applications Included in this category are titanium vanadium tungsten and tantalum now used in metallurgy or for electriclamp fila ments thoria and ceria in the form of mantles for incandescent lamps pyrophoric alloys of cerium and other metals zirconia which appears to be a most valuable re fractory material and compounds of radium and of mesothorium for medical use as well as for research Hydrogen to gether with oxygen and nitrogen are in demand for synthetic purposes and the first also for lighterthanair craft Ozone is considerably used for sterilizing water and as an oxidizing agent for example in the preparation of vanillin from isoeugenol and hydrogen peroxide now obtainable 438 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 very pure in concentrated solution and the peroxides of a number of the metals are also utilized in many different ways The per acidsperboric percarbonie and per sulphuricor their salts are employed for oxidizing and bleaching purposes and sodium hydrosulphite is much in demand as a reducing agente g in dyeing with in digo Hydroxylamine and hydrazine are used in considerable quantity and the manufacture of cyanides by one or other of the modern methods has become quite an important industry mainly owing to the use of the alkali salts in the cyanide proc ess of gold extraction These remarkable compounds the metallic carbonyis have been investigated and nickel carbonyl is employed on the commercial scale in the ex traction of the metal Fine chemicals for analysis and research are now supplied as a matter of course in a state of purity rarely attained a quarter of a century ago In the organic chemical industry similar continued progress is to be noted Acces sions are constantly being made to the al ready enormous list of synthetic dyes not only by the addition of new members to existing groups but also by the discovery of entirely new classes of tinctorial com pounds natural indigo seems doomed to share the fate of alizarine from madder and to be ousted by synthetic indigo of which moreover a number of useful deriv atives are also made Synthetic drugs of all kindsantipyrine and phenacetin sulphonal and veronal novacain and 8 eucaine salol and aspirin piperazine and adrenaline atoxyl and salvarsanare pro duced in large quantities as also are many synthetic perfumes and flavoring materials such as ionone heliotropine and vanillin Cellulose in the form of artificial silk is much used as a new textile material syn thetic camphor is on the market synthetic rubber is said to be produced in consider able quantity and the manufacture of materials for photographic work and of or ganic compounds for research purposes is no small part of the industry However it would serve no useful purpose to extend this catalogue which might be done almost indefinitely British chemists are entitled to regard with satisfaction the part which they have taken in the development of scientific chemistry during the last three decades as in the past but with respect to the progress of industrial chemistry it must be regret fully admitted that except in isolated cases we have failed to keep pace with our com petitors Consider a single example Al though there still remain in South America considerable deposits of sodium nitrate which can be worked at a profit it is clear that sooner or later other sources of nitric acid must be made available The synthetic production of nitric acid from the air is now a commercial success several different processes are in operation abroad and Germany is reported to be quite independ ent of outside supplies Electrical energy upon the cost of which the success of the process largely depends can be produced in this country at least as cheaply as in Ger many and yet we have done nothing in the matter unless we count as something the appointment of a committee to consider pos sibilities This case is only too typical of many others A number of different causes have contributed to bring about this state of affairs and the responsibility for it is as signed by some to the government by others to the chemical manufacturers and by still others to the professors of chemistry I think however it will be generally ad mitted that the root of the matter is to be found in the general ignorance of and in difference to the methods and results of scientific work which characterize the peo ple of this country For many years past SCIENCE 439N S VOL XLIV No 1135 our leaders in science have done all that lay in their power to awaken the country to the inevitable and deplorable results of this form of sleeping sickness but hitherto their reception has been much the same as that accorded to the hero of The Pilgrims Progress as depicted in the fol lowing passage He went on thus even until he came at a bottom where he saw a little out of the way three Men fast asleep with Fetters upon their heels The name of the one was Simple an other Sloth and the third Presumption Christian then seeing them in this case went to them if peradventure he might awaken them And cried You are like them that sleep on the top of a Mast for the Dead Sea is under you a Gulf that hath no bottom Awake therefore and come away be willing also and I will help you off with your irons He also told them If he that goeth about like a Roaritg Lion comes by you well certainly become a prey to his teeth  With that they lookt upon him and began to reply in this sort Simple said I see no danger Sloth said Yet a little more sleep and Presumption said Every Vat must Stand upon his own bottom And they lay down to sleep again and Christian went on his way I believe that a brighter day is dawning and that if only we rise to the occasion now chemistry in this country will attain the position of importance which is its due Meantime it is of no avail to lament lost opportunities or to indulge in unprofitable recrimination on the contrary it should be our business to find a remedy for the ar rested development of our chemical indus try and the task of establishing remedial measures should be taken in hand by the state the universities and the chemical manufacturers themselves As regards another very large group of interested per sons the consumers of chemical products or in other words the nation as a whole it is surely not too much to expect that they have been taught by the course of events since the outbreak of the war the folly of depending solely upon foreign and possibly hostile manufacturers even although fiscal and other advantages may enable the alien to undersell the home producer Consider ing that the future prosperity of the empire depends largely upon the wellbeing of its chemical industries it is simply suicidal to permit these to be crippled or even crushed out of existence by competition on unequal terms The government has taken a most signif icant step in advance by appointing an ad visory council for scientific and industrial research and providing it with funds inci dentally in so doing it has recognized the past failure of the state to afford adequate support to scientific work The advisory council has lost no time in getting to work and has already taken steps to allocate grants in support of a number of investiga tions of firstrate importance to industry In order to be in a position to do justice to the branches of industry concerned in pro posed researches which have been submitted by institutions and individuals it has de cided to appoint standing committees of experts and has already constituted strong committees in mining metallurgy and in engineering a committee in chemistry will no doubt be appointed in due course The council also makes the gratifying intimation that the training of an adequate supply of research workers will be an important part of its work It is safe to prophesy that the money ex pended by the advisory council will sooner or later yield a goodly return and this justifies the hope that the government will not rest satisfied with their achievement 440 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 but will take further steps in the same direction This desire for continued action finds strong support in the recommenda tions made by a subcommittee of the ad visory committee to the board of trade on commercial intelligence which was ap pointed to report with respect to measures for securing the position after the war of certain branches of British industry Of these recommendations I quote the follow ing 1 Scientific Industrial Research and Traininga Larger funds should be placed at the disposal of the new committee of the privy council and also of the board of education for the promotion of scientific and industrial training b The univer sities should be encouraged to maintain and extend research work devoted to the main industry or industries located in their re spective districts and manufacturers en gaged in these industries should be encour aged to cooperate with the universities in such work either through their existing trade associations or through associations specially formed for the purpose Such associations should bring to the knowledge of the universities the difficulties and needs of the industries and give financial and other assistance in addition to that afforded by the state In the case of nonlocalized industries trade associations should be ad vised to seek in respect of centers for re search the guidance of the advisory com mittee of the privy council c An au thoritative record of consultant scientists chemists and engineers and of persons en gaged in industrial research should be established and maintained by some suita ble government department for the use of manufacturers only 2 Tariff ProtectionWher6 the na tional supply of certain manufactured ar ticles which aie of vital importance to the national safety or are essential to other industries has fallen into the hands of manufacturers or traders outside this coun try British manufacturers ready to under take the manufacture of such articles in this country should be afforded sufficient tariff protection to enable them to main tain such production after the war It is also recommended by the subcommittee that in view of the threatened dumping of stocks which may be accumulated in enemy countries the government should take such steps as would prevent the position of in dustries likely to be affected being en dangered after the war 3 Patents a The efforts which have been made to secure uniformity of patent law throughout the empire should be con tinued b The provisions of the law as to the compulsory working of patents in the United Kingdom should be more rigorously enforced and inspectors should be ap pointed to secure that such working is com plete and not only partial The adoption by the government of these weighty recommendations would go far to establish British chemical industry on a secure basis and would undoubtedly lead to the expansion of already existing branches and the establishment of new ones Meanwhile the Australian government has set an example which might be followed with great advantage Shortly after the British scheme for the development of scientific and industrial research under the auspices of the advisory council had been made public the prime minister of Aus tralia determined to do still more for the commonwealth with the object of making it independent of German trade and manu factures after the conclusion of the war He therefore appointed a committee repre sentative of the state scientific departments the universities and industrial interests and within a very short period the com mittee produced a scheme for the estab SCIENCE 441N S VoL XLIV No 1135 lishment of a Commonwealth Institute of Science and Industry The institute is to be governed by three directors two of whom will be scientific men of high standing while the third will be selected for proved ability in business The directors are to be assisted by an advisory council composed of nine representatives of science and of industry these representatives are to seek information advice and assistance from specialists throughout Australia The chief functions of the institute are 1 To ascer tain what industrial problems are most pressing and most likely to yield to scien tific experimental investigation to seek out the most competent men to whom such re search may be entrusted and to provide them with all the necessary appliances and assistance 2 To build up a bureau of scientific and industrial information which shall be at the service of all concerned in the industries and manufactures of the commonwealth 3 To erect staff and control special research laboratories the first of which will probably be a physical laboratory somewhat on the lines of our National Physical Laboratory Other func tions of the institute are the coordination and direction of research and experimental work with a view to the prevention of un desirable overlapping of effort the recom mendation of grants of the commonwealth government in aid of pure scientific re search in existing institutions and the establishment and award of industrial re search fellowships This admirable scheme is more compre hensive and more generous than that of our government but it could be rivaled without much difficulty We already possess an im portant asset in the National Physical Labo ratory and there now exists the advisory council with its extensive powers and duties What is lacking in our scheme so far as chemistry is concerned could be made good firstly by providing the ad visory council with much larger funds and secondly by the establishment of a National Chemical Laboratoryan insti tute for research in pure and applied chem istryor by assisting the development of research departments in our universities and technical colleges as is now being done in America or better still by moving in both directions With respect to the sec ond alternative I do not mean to suggest that research work is neglected in the chem istry departments of any of our higher in stitutions what I plead for is the provision of greater facilities for the prosecution of investigation not only in pure but also in applied chemistry As things are at pres ent the professors and lecturers are for the most part so much occupied in teaching and in administration as to be unable to devote time uninterruptedly to research work which demands above all things continuity of effort The ideal remedy would be the institution of research professorships but failing this the burden of teaching and ad ministrative work should be lightened by appointing larger staffs It has been suggested by Dr Forster that the state could render assistance to chem ical industry in another way namely by the formation of a Chemical Intelligence Department of the Board of Trade which should be concerned with technical com mercial and educational questions bearing upon the industry Under the first head the proposed department would have the duty a of collecting tabulating and dis tributing all possible information regarding chemical discoveries patents and manu facturing processes and b of presenting problems for investigation to research chem ists of course under proper safeguards and with suitable remuneration The more strictly commercial side of the departments activities would be concerned with the 442 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 classification of the resources of the empire as regards raw materials and of foreign chemical products in respect of distribu tion throughout the world with ruling prices tariffs cost of transport and if pos sible cost of production On the educa tional side it is suggested that the depart mernt should collect data regarding oppor tunities for chemical instruction and re search in various parts of the empire and should consider possible improvements and extensions of these The department would of course be in charge of a highly trained chemist with a sufficient number of chemical assistants This proposal which has been widely discussed and on the whole very favorably received by chemists has much to recom mend it to mention only one point the unrivalled resources of the Board of Trade would facilitate the acquisition of informa tion which might otherwise be difficult to obtain or which would not be disclosed ex cept to a government department The principal objections which have been raised are based upon the fear that the proposed department however energetic and enter prising it might be at the start would soon be so helplessly gagged and bound down by departmental red tape as to become of little or no service This danger however could be obviated to a great extent by the institu tion of a strong advisory committee repre sentative of and elected by the societies con cerned with the different branches of chemistry which would keep closely in touch with the Chemical Intelligence De partment on the one hand and with the in dustry on the other and which would act as adviser of the permanent scientific staff of the department There is I fear little chance of seeing Dr Forsters proposal carried into effect unless all the societies concerned move actively and unitedly in the matter they must do the pioneer work and must submit a definite scheme to the government if the desired result is to be attained In the not improbable contin gency that the board of trade will decline to take action I trust that the scheme for the establishment of an Information Bu reauon lines similar to but somewhat less widereaching than those which I have just indicatedwhich has been under the care ful consideration of the Council of the So ciety of Chemical Industry will be vigor ously prosecuted Difficulties chiefly finan cial stand in the way but these are not insuperable especially if the sympathy and support of the government can be en listed Unless the conditions and methods which have ruled in the past are greatly altered it is hardly possible to hope that the future prospects of our chemical industry will be bright it is essential that the representa tives of the industry should organize them selves in their own interest and cooperate in fighting the common enemy More than ever is this the case when as we are in formed three different groups of German producers of dyes drugs and fine chemicals who own seven large factories have formed a combination with a capital of more than 11000000 and with other assets of very great value in the shape of scientific tech nical and financial efficiency Hence it is eminently satisfactory to be able to record the active progress of a movement origi nated by the Chemical Society which has culminated in the formation of an Asso ciation of British Chemical Manufacturers The main objects of the association are to promote cooperation between British chem ical manufacturers to act as a medium for placing before the government and govern ment officials the views of manufacturers upon matters affecting the chemical indus try to develop technical organization and promote industrial research to keep in SCIENCE 443N S VOL XLIV No 1135 touch with the progress of chemical knowl edge and to facilitate the development of new British industries and the extension of existing ones and to encourage the sym pathetic association of British manufac turers with the various universities and technical colleges Needless to say the progress of this im portant movement will be assisted by every one who is interested either directly or in directly in the welfare of our chemical industry and moreover the support of the scientific societies will not be lacking for as the result of a conference convened by the President and Council of the Royal Society a Conjoint Board of Scientific So cieties has been constituted for the fur therance of the following objects Promo ting the cooperation of those interested in pure or applied science supplying a means whereby scientific opinion may find effec tive expression on matters relating to sci ence industry and education taking such action as may be necessary to promote the application of science to our industries and to the service of the nation and discussing scientific questions in which international cooperation seems advisable In an address given to the Society of Chemical Industry last year I indicated another way in which chemical manufac turers can help themselves and at the same time promote the interests of chemistry in this country In the United States of America individual manufacturers or asso ciations of manufacturers have shown themselves ready to take up the scheme originated by the late Professor Duncan for the institution of industrial research scholarships tenable at the universities or technical colleges and the results obtained after ten years experience of the working of this practical method of promoting co operation between science and industry have more than justified the anticipations of its originator The scheme is worthy of adoption on many grounds of which the chief are that it provides definite subjects for technical research to young chemists qualified for such work that it usually leads to positions in factories for chemists who have proved their capacity through the work done while holding scholarships and that it reacts for good on the profession generally by bringing about that more intimate intercourse between teachers and manufacturers which is so much to be desired In this connection the recent foundation of the Willard Gibbs chair of research in pure chemistry at the University of Pitts burgh is extremely significant for it shows that even in such a purely industrial com munity as Pittsburgh it is recognized that the most pressing need of the day is the endowment of chemical research and the creation of research professorships Mr A P Fleming who recently made a tour of inspection of research laboratories in the United States points to the amount of work done by individual firms and the in creased provision now being made for re search in universities and technical insti tutions He reports that at the present time there are upwards of fifty corpora tions having research laboratories costing annually from 20000 to 100000 for maintenance and states that some of the most striking features of the research work in America are the lavish manner in which the laboratories have been planned which in many cases enables large scale opera tions to be carried out in order to deter mine the best possible methods of manu facturing any commodity developed or dis covered in the laboratories the increasing attention given in the research laboratories to pure science investigation this being in my opinion the most important phase of industrial research and the absorption of 444 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 men who have proved their capacity for industrial research in such places as the Mellon Institute the Bureau of Standards etc by the various industries in which they have taken scientific interest It is evidently the view of American manufac turers that industrial research can be made to pay for itself and that to equip and maintain research laboratories is an excel lent investment It can not be too often reiterated that no branch of chemical industry can afford to stand still for there is no finality in manu facturing processes all are capable of im provement and for this as well as for the discovery and the application of new proc esses the services of the trained rchemist are essential Hence the training of chem ists for industrial work is a matter of su preme importance We may therefore con gratulate ourselves that the opportunities for chemical instruction in this country are immensely greater than they were thirty years ago The claims of chemistry to a leading position have been recognized by all our universities even the most ancient by the provision of teaching staffs labo ratories and equipment on a fairly ade quate if not a lavish scale and in this re spect many of the technical colleges fall not far behind The evening classes con ducted in a large number of technical insti tutions are hardly fitted to produce fully trained chemists if only because lack of the necessary time prevents the student from obtaining that prolonged practise in the laboratory which cannot be dispensed with unless indeed he is prepared to go through a course of study extending over many years At the same time these evening classes play a most important part firstly in disseminating a knowledge of chemistry throughout the country and secondly in affording instruction of a high order in special branches of applied chemistry Finally in a large and increasing number of schools a more or less satisfactory intro duction to the science is given by well qualified teachers With our national habit of selfdepreciation we are apt to overlook the steady progress which has been made but at the same time I do not suggest that there is no room for improvement of our system of training chemists Progress in every department of industrial chemistry is ultimately dependent upon research and therefore a sufficient supply of chem ists with practical knowledge and experi ence of the methods of research is vital This being so it is an unfortunate thing that so many students are allowed to leave the universities in possession of a science degree but without any experience in in vestigation The training of the chemist so far as that training can be given in a teaching institution must be regarded as incomplete unless it includes some research work not of course because every student has the mental gifts which characterize the born investigator but rather because of the inestimable value of the experience gained when he has to leave the beaten track and to place more dependence upon his own initiative and resource Consequently one rejoices to learn that at the University of Oxford no candidate can now obtain an honors degree without having produced evidence that he has taken part in original research and that the General Board of Studies at Cambridge has also made pro posals which if adopted will have the ef fect of encouraging systematic research work Perhaps it is too much to expect that practise in research will be made an indispensable qualification for the ordi nary degree failing this and indeed in every case promising students should be encouraged by the award of research scholarships to continue their studies for a period of at least two years after taking SCIENCE 445N S VOL XLIV No 1135 the BSc degree and to devote that time to research work which would qualify for a higher degree In this connection an ex cellent objectlesson is at hand for the out put of research work from the Scottish universities has very greatly increased since the scheme of the Carnegie Trust for the institution of research scholarships has come into operation Thanks to these scholarships numbers of capable young graduates who otherwise for the most part would have had to seek paid employment as soon as their degree courses were com pleted have been enabled to devote two or more years to research work Of course it must be recognized that not every chem ist has the capacity to initiate or inspire investigation and that no amount of train ing however thorough and comprehensive will make a man an investigator unless he has the natural gift At the same time whilst only the few are able to originate really valuable research work a large army of disciplined men who have had training in the methods of research is required to carry out experimentally the ideas of the master mind Moreover there is ample scope in industrial work for chemists who although not gifted with initiative as in vestigators are suitably equipped to super vise and control the running of largescale processes the designing of appropriate plant the working out on the manufac turing scale of new processes or the im provement of existing onesmen of a thor oughly practical mind who never lose sight of costs output and efficiency and who have a sufficient knowledge of engineering to make their ideas and suggestions clear to the engineering expert Further there has to be considered the necessity for the work of the skilled analyst in the exami nation of raw materials and the testing of intermediate and finished products al though much of the routine work of the in dustrial laboratory will advisedly be left in the hands of apprentices working under the control of the chemist Lastly for the buying and selling of materials there should be a demand for the chemist with the com mercial faculty highly developed There is indeed in any large industrial establish ment room for chemists of several different types but all of these should have had the best possible training and it must be the business of our higher teaching institutions to see that this training is provided On more than one occasion I have ex pressed the opinion that every chemist who looks forward to an industrial post should receive in the course of his training a cer tain amount of instruction in chemical engineering by means of lectures and also of practical work in laboratories fitted out for the purpose The practicability of this has been proved in more than one teaching institution and experience has convinced me that chemists who have had such a course are generally more valuable in a workswhether their ultimate destination is the industrial research laboratory or the control of manufacturing operationsthan those who have not had their studies di rected beyond the traditional boundaries of pure chemistry I used the word tradi tional because to my mind there is no boundary line between the domains of pure and of applied chemistry A course in chemical engineering preferably preceded by a short course in general engineering and drawing must however be introduced as a supplement to and not as a substitute for any part of the necessary work in pure chemistry and consequently the period of undergraduate study will be lengthened if such a course is included this is no dis advantage but quite the contrary I am glad to say that the University of Glasgow has recently instituted a degree in applied chemistry for which the curriculum in 446 SCIENCESEPTEMBER 29 1916 eludes chemical engineering in addition to the usual courses in chemistry and I hope that a place will be found for this subject by other universities On the whole there is not much fault to be found with the training for chemists supplied by the universities and technical colleges but there is still room for improve ments which could and would be carried out if it were not that the scientific depart ments of these institutions are as a rule hampered by lack of funds The facilities for practical instruction with respect to accommodation and equipment are gen erally adequate but on the other hand the persornnel could with advantage be largely increased and at least the junior members of the staffs are miserably underpaid It would doubtless be regarded as insanity to suggest that a scientific man however eminent should receive more than a frac tion of the salary to which a musichall artiste or a lawyer politician can as pire but if the best brains in the country are to be attracted towards science as they ought to be some greater inducement than a mere living wage should be held out Hence no opportunity should be lost of im pressing upon the government the neces sity for increasing the grants to the scien tific departments of our higher teaching institutions and for the provision of re search scholarships It is much to be de sired also that wealthy men in this country should take an example from America and acquire more generally the habit of devot ing some part of their means to the endow ment of higher education The private donations for science and education made in the United States during the last forty three years amount to the magnificent sum of 117000000 and recently the average annual benefactions for educational pur poses total nearly 6000000 Of course there are few if any of the universities and colleges in this country which are not deeply indebted to the foresight and gen erosity of private benefactors but the lav ish scale on which funds are provided in America leads to a certain feeling of ad miring envy After all the chief difficulty which con fronts those who are eager for progress in educational matters is that so many of our most famous schools are still conducted on medieval lines in the sense that the edu cation administered is almost wholly classical Consequently though science enters into every part of modern life and scientific method is necessary for success in all undertakings the affairs of the coun try are in the hands of legislators who not only have little or no acquaintance with the fundamental facts and principles sig nified by these aspects of knowledge but also do not understand how such matters can be used to strengthen and develop the state Our administrative officials are also mostly under the same disabilities on ac count of their want of a scientific training They are educated at schools Where science can receive little encouragement and they do not take up scientific subjects in the examinations for the civil service because marks can be much more easily obtained by attention to Latin and Greek and the re sult of it all is that science is usually treated with indifference often with contempt and rarely with intelligent appreciation by the statesmen and members of the public serv ices whose decisions and acts largely deter mine the countrys welfare The defects of a system which places the chief power of an organization which needs understanding of science in every department in the hands of people who have not received any training in scientific subjects or methods are obvious 2 The remedy is also obvious Here again the prospects are now 2 Nature February 10 1916 SCIENCE 447N S VoL XLIV No 1135 brighter than ever before because the warnings and appeals of men of science have at last and after many years begun to bear fruit or perhaps it would be more correct to say the lessons of the war have begun to make an impression on the powers that be Within the last few weeks it has been intimated that the government giving ear to what has been uttered incessantly and almost ad nauseam with regard to British neglect of science proposes to ap point a committee to inquire into the posi tion of science in our national system of education especially in universities and sec ondary schools The duty of the committee will be to advise the authorities how to promote the advancement of pure science and also the interests of trade industries and professions dependent on the applica tion of science bearing in mind the needs of what is described as a liberal education It is stated that the committee will include scientific men in whom the country will have confidence some of those who appre ciate the application of science to commerce and industry and some who are able from general experience to correlate scientific teaching with education as a whole I am sure that we may look forward with confi dence to the recommendations of such a committee and we shall hope for the sake of our country that their recommendations will be adopted and put in force with the least possible delay G G HENDERSON

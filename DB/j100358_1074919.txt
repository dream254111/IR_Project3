ILLUMINATION HE YIELDS INCREASE LIFE THE TEACHER ALIKE BY INFORMATION GIVEN AND BY DISCIPLINE ENFORCED ENABLES HIS PUPILS MORE EFFECT UALLY TO CARRY ON THIS OR THAT OCCUPATION AND OBTAIN BETTER

THE POPULAR SCIENCE MONTHLY FOR MAYTHE SCHOOL REVIEW AS WITH ANIMALS SO WITH CHILDREN ANY SEEMINGLY UNCAUSED MOVEMENT IS APT TO EXCITE A FEELING OF ALARM JUST AS A DOG WILL RUN AWAY FROM A LEAF WHIRLED ABOUT BY THE WIND SO CHILDREN ARE APT TO BE TERRIFIED BY THE STRANGE AND QUITE IRREGULAR BEHAVIOR OF A FEATHER AS IT GLIDES ALONG THE FLOOR OR LIFTS ITSELF INTO THE AIR IN THESE CASES WE MAY SUPPOSE THAT WE HAVE TO DO WITH A GERM OF SUPER STITIOUS FEAR WHICH SEEMS COMMONLY TO HAVE ITS STARTING POINT IN THE APPEAR ANCE OF SOMETHING EXCEPTIONAL AND UNCANNY THAT IS UNINTELLIGIBLE AND SO SMACKING OF THE SUPERNATURAL THE FEAR OF FEATHERS AS UNCANNY OBJECTS PLAYS I AM TOLD A CONSIDERABLE PART IN THE SUPERSTITIONS OF FOLKLORE SUCH APPA RENTLY SELFCAUSED MOVEMENT SO SUGGESTIVE OF LIFE MIGHT EASILY GIVE RISE TO A VAGUE SENSE OF A MYSTERIOUS PRESENCE OR POWER POSSESSING THE OBJECT AND SO LEAD TO A CRUDE FORM OF A BELIEF IN SUPERNATURAL AGENTS IN OTHER CASES OF UNEXPECTED AND MYSTERIOUS MOVEMENT THE FEAR IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT A LITTLE BOY WHEN A YEAR AND ELEVEN MONTHS WAS FRIGHTENED WHEN VISITING A LADYS HOUSE BY A TOY ELEPHANT WHICH SHOOK ITS HEAD THE SAME CHILD WRITES HIS MOTHER  AT ONE YEAR AND SEVEN MONTHS WAS VERY MUCH SCARED BY A TOY COW WHICH MOOED REALISTICALLY WHEN ITS HEAD WAS MOVED THIS COW WAS SUBSEQUENTLY GIVEN TO HIM AT ABOUT TWO YEARS AND THREE MONTHS

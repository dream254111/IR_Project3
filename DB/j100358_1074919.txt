important place Professor Francis N Thorpe in the July Harpers describes some of the more conspicuous services of the institution giving due credit to Benjamin Franklin for his large share in its foundation The paper is fully illustrated A feature of the June Forum is a group of three educational articles These three articles are  A Rational Correlation of School Studies by Dr J M Rice which is the topic at present in primary educational circles An American Educational System in Fact by E P Powell which is an explanation of the advantages of State control of universities and a thorough examination of the management of their finances by our univer sities and colleges by President Charles F Thwing of the Western Reserve University who shows that a bequest or gift to an educational institution has proven to be the best possible investment of capital The Sociological Function of the Professions From Professional Institu tions by HERBERT SPENCER in The Popular Science Monthly for May The defence of life the regulation of life and the sustentation of life having been achieved what further general function is there  There is the augmentation of life and this function it is which the professions in general subserve It is obvious that the medical man who removes pains sets broken bones cures diseases and wards off premature death increases the amount of life Musical composers and performers as well as professors of music and dancing are agents who exalt the emotions and so increase life The poet epic lyric or dramatic along with the actor severally in their respective ways yield pleasurable feelings and so increaselife The historian and the man of letters to some extent by the guidance they furnish but to a larger extent by the interest which their facts and fictions create raise mens mental states and so increase life Though we can not say of the lawyer that he does the like in a direct way yet by aiding the citizen to resist aggressions he furthers his sustentation and thereby increases life The multitudinous processes and appliances which the man of science makes possible as well as the innumerable intellectual interests he arouses and the general illumination he yields increase life The teacher alike by information given and by discipline enforced enables his pupils more effect ually to carry on this or that occupation and obtain better subsistence than they would else do at the same time that he opens the doors to various special gratifications in both ways increasing life Once more those who carry on the plastic artsthe painter the sculptor the architectexcite by their products pleasurable perceptions and emotions of the aesthetic class and thus increase life Causes of Fear in Children Prof JAMES SULLY Studies of Childhood in the Popular Science Monthly for MayThe School Review As with animals so with children any seemingly uncaused movement is apt to excite a feeling of alarm Just as a dog will run away from a leaf whirled about by the wind so children are apt to be terrified by the strange and quite irregular behavior of a feather as it glides along the floor or lifts itself into the air In these cases we may suppose that we have to do with a germ of super stitious fear which seems commonly to have its starting point in the appear ance of something exceptional and uncanny that is unintelligible and so smacking of the supernatural The fear of feathers as uncanny objects plays I am told a considerable part in the superstitions of folklore Such appa rently selfcaused movement so suggestive of life might easily give rise to a vague sense of a mysterious presence or power possessing the object and so lead to a crude form of a belief in supernatural agents In other cases of unexpected and mysterious movement the fear is slightly different A little boy when a year and eleven months was frightened when visiting a ladys house by a toy elephant which shook its head The same child writes his mother  at one year and seven months was very much scared by a toy cow which mooed realistically when its head was moved This cow was subsequently given to him at about two years and three months He was then still afraid of it but became reconciled soon after first allowing others to make it moo if he was at a safe distance and at last making it moo himself The Popiular Science Monthly July

Children Lie by Nathan Oppenheim M D The Method of leaching Languages BY JOHN STUART BLACKIE From Littells Living Age No 2651 Instead of books and grammar rules the teacher of languages should commence with giving the foreign name to all the familiar objects which the schoolroom contains and with which it is surrounded The door and the window the teachers rostrum and the childrens seats the fire with the tongs and poker and the coalscuttle the pictures on the wall and the lobby where caps and greatcoats and umbrellas for a rainy day and all the paraphernalia of a well ordered school are marshalled in orderly array And not only inside but outside the school house everything that meets the eye of the observant tyro should be greeted with the new namethe old castle on the brae the hollow cave in the glen the flowers in the meadow the cloudcleaving Ben that kisses the sky and the garden of flowers in the green meadow also all living creatures that habitually meet the eye and de light the soul of a healthy young childthe dog that wags his tail the cock that crows the hen that pecks the gravel for grains of corn the bird that sings in the wood the duck that paddles in the pond and the trout that rises to the fly all this in the direct and circumambient drama of living inter est not grammar rules and grey books should form the material used by the 458Current Educational Literature teacher of languages just as directly as the stones from the quarry form the material out of which the cunning architect trims his cottage or piles his palace Pedagogic Craze for Novelty From Elementary Education by the Hon WILLIAM T HARRIS United States Commissioner of Education in North American Review for May While the old education in its exclusive devotion to will training has slighted the intellect and the heart or feelings the new education moves likewise towards an extreme as bad or worse It slights direct will culture and tends to exaggerate impulse and inclination or interest An educational psychology that degrades will to desire must perforce construct an elaborate system for the purpose of developing moral interests and desires This however does not quite succeed until the old doctrine of selfsacrifice for the sake of the good is reached Our wills are ours to make them thine The philosophy of the Bhagavad Gita holds that the goal of culture is to annihilate all interest and attain absolute indifferencethis is adopted by Buddhism in the doctrine of Nirvana Indian renunciation reaches the de nial of selfhood while the Christian doctrine of renunciation reaches only to the denial of selfishness and the adoption of altruistic interests However this may be the pedagogic impulse to create devices for awakening the in terest of the pupil becomes sometimes a craze for novelty Change at any price and change of any kind is clamored for It is a trite saying that change is not progress It is more apt to be movement in a circle or even retrogression An amusing example was lately furnished in educational circles A superintendent of rural schools defended their want of classifi cation as an advantage It was individual instruction and as such an improvement over that of the graded schools of the cities His reactionary movement received the support of some of the advocates of educational re form on the ground that it was a new departure This happened at a time when one half of the school children in the United States are still taught or rather allowed to memorize their text books by this method The sub committees on training of teachers and on the organization of city school systems have brought forward in their respective reports the latest devised measures for the perfection of normal schools and the procurement of ex pert supervisors for city school systems The importance of the recom mendations regarding schools for the training of teachers is seen when one recalls to mind the fact that the entire upward movement of the elementary schools has been initiated and sustained by the employment of professionally trained teachers and that the increase of urban population has made it possible In the normal school the candidate is taught the history of educa tion the approved methods of instruction and the grounds of each branch of study as they are to be found in the sciences that it

of exstudents from Girton Newnham Somerville Hall Halloway College and Alexandra College whose aftercareers we have men tioned above amounts to fourteen hundred and eightysix of these six hun dred and eighty are engaged in teaching two hundred and eight have mar ried eleven are doctors or preparing to be doctors and medical missionaries two are nurses eight or nine are in government employment one is a book binder one is a marketgardener and one is a lawyer Besides these reg ular employments which are enumerated and duly scheduled in these re ports there must be without doubt a great deal of unpaid work done by those exstudents who live at home which it is difficult indeed impossible to put into any ist For instance some universityeducated women are en gaged in literary workwhile others employ themselves in various useful works connected with philanthropic and charitable undertakings around their homes and are doubtless doing their business all the better and more practically for their university training but these diverse occupations are hardly of a kind to be called a definite career A special feature of the July issue of The Chautauquan is the publication of the entire

be grouped under several subgenera names for two of which are here suggested for the first time as follows Genus MYRMA Billberg 1820 Polyrhachis F Smith 1858 1 Subgenus Campomyrma subgen nov  Cohors Polyrhachides camponotiformes Emery Type Polyrhachis clypeata Mayr 2 Subgenus Myrma Billberg  Hoplomyrmus Gerst Cohors Polyrhachides carinatee Emery Type Formica militaris Fabr 3 Subgenus Polyrhachis

Hemioptica scissa Roger A third generic name Formicina Shkd which has been overlooked is mentioned in the foregoing citation from the work of Swainson and Shuckard This citation and the context seem to show that Shuckard accepted Formica Linn in a restricted sense as the equivalent of what we now know as Camponotus Mayr probably with the type Formica herculeana Linn but this is open to doubt since no species is cited On the same page two well known ants are mentioned as species of Formicina viz F rufa Linn and F flava Fabr If only the former species had been mentioned we might have been compelled to change our modern genus Formica to Formi cina but as Shuckard included also F flava which is at present Lasius flavus in the same genus we see that Formicina is merely a synonym of Formica as used by Fabricius and his contemporaries possibly minus the group now known as Camponotus Under the circumstances I can see no reason to replace any of the modern subdivisions of the old Linnean genus Formica with Formicina Shuckard W M WHEELER 7 According to Emery schistacea is merely a sub species of militaris ON MUSCOID AND ESPECIALLY TACHINID SYNONYMY THE time seems ripe for a few remarks on this subject There exists in the superfamily Muscoidea an immense taxonomic field await ing exploitation and it is to be hoped that it will attract many able workers imbued with a proper sense of responsibility for it is at the same time a biologic field of first importance and magnitude as regards arthropod and gen eral invertebrate evolution Only one caution is necessary to those who would enter this field as well as to those already in itand this applies as well to all workers in whatever field which is to do ones work so thoroughly as to secure absolute finality before drawing posi tive conclusions In other words do not make an unqualified statement before going to the bottom of the matter in hand Results se cured during the past three years have demon strated conclusively that finality in the tax onomy and consequently in the synonymy can not be secured in this superfamily by the offhand comparison or even by the most care ful study of external adult characters alone Mr D W Coquillett in his  Revision of the Tachinidae of America north of Mexico1 without the knowledge just mentioned and thus without any true conception of the great difficulties before him moreover without a good eye for external characters and with little appreciation of their importance but nevertheless with the best of intentions at tempted to group these flies comprehensively and indicated extensive but often incorrect synonymy lumping even distinct genera under one species in the most uncouth but seemingly plausible manner We can not but admire the industry and ingenuity which have contrib uted to produce this work while we deplore its great lack of quality Dr J M Aldrich in his  Catalogue of the North American Dip tera2 also without the above knowledge but with a somewhat better eye for external char acters though following Mr Ooquillett quite faithfully in the main has resurrected a few 1 Techn Ser Bull No 7 Div Ent U S Dept Agr 1897 2 Smiths Misc Colls No 1444 1905 860 SCIENCEJUNE 2 1911 SCIENCE species from the latters synonymy My own publications on the subject which have been quite extensive and in which I have proposed many new genera and species no small part of which may quite possibly have to go in the final synonymy were produced almost in whole without the above knowledge but with a very considerable appreciation of the necessity for a most careful and minute comparison of external characters Brauer and von Bergen stamms monumental work performed under the same conditions and unquestionably the best and most advanced of all must be classed here too along with all other taxonomic work in the Muscoidea to 1908 The results in all these cases have been quite unfortunate con sidering the amount of time and energy ex pended All the Inaterial handled by Mr Coquillett will have to be restudied with great care in the light of dissections of fresh ma terial from type localities My own types and those of Brauer and von Bergenstamm will have to be restudied in the same manner In fact all accessible muscoid types the world over will have to be restudied in this new light Here is an amount of work to be done that almost staggers one to contemplate Brauer and von Bergenstamm possessed a most acute appreciation of the necessity for searching out even the most minute external characters in order to arrive at the true rela tionships of the forms They probably car ried the study of the external adult characters about as far as it can be advantageously done without correlation with the reproductive and earlystage characters I have perhaps gone somewhat farther in my consideration of the external adult characters in the Taxonomy of the Muscoidean Flies8 but so far as I yet know without any great improvement in the general results It is thus evident that for the future the older order of taxonomic work in these groups must be exchanged for the newer one which has come into full light but recently and which demands the exhaustive study not only of the external and largely the internal characters of the adult but also of the Smiths Misc Coils No 1803 May 1908 characters of the eggs and early stages It may even greatly profit by a study of general bionomics especially host relations It is truly a most remarkable state of affairs that finds us at the present day unable to define some of the most common genera of tachinid flies Nevertheless such is the fact and necessarily follows from what has here been said The type species of each genus must be dissected before we may know what species themselves dissected can be referred to that genus The material for such dissec tions should be fresh and that for type dissec tions should be obtained from the type locali ties so far as possible I have already done this work for a considerable number of genera and the results will I hope be published within the year accompanied by necessary drawings But hundreds of genera many of them represented by names long in common use remain to be investigated in this manner and thus we frequently find ourselves at this late day unable to determine material in these groups with any hope of finality In a recent letter to me Dr John B Smith has restated the conditions in the following apt words which I can not refrain from quoting It is perhaps not surprising that in the Diptera which are without any doubt physiologically the most highly developed of all orders the difficulties in classification should be greatest Their special ization has extended in so many directions that the divergencies have become marked by internal modifications rather than external adaptations He precedes these remarks by stating his belief that it will require a study of the internal organs to get a satisfactory classifi cation which may afterwards be helped out by external characters whose importance is not recognized at the present time This remark is well worthy of consideration The correlation of the external adult characters with those of the reproductive system and early stages will define the relative taxonomic value of the first in the various groups and may reveal unsuspected characters among them which will hold good for considerable series of groups 861N S VOL XXXTIn No 857 The publication at this time of these re marks in their present form has been prompted by the recent appearance of Mr W R Thomp sons Synonymical and other Notes on Dip tera which have just reached me and which I am extremely glad in this case to see pub lished since they are here serving the useful purpose of calling forth some timely observa tions that would otherwise have been reserved for the future It is hardly possible that the synonymy indicated in the abovementioned notes will eventually prove to be final If so it will indicate the possession on the part of its author of most astute perception and per fect judgment of external adult characters such as I myself can not lay claim to after more than twenty years study of these flies For the present it certainly can not be ac cepted as such No matter how carefully done or how clear ones perception final syn onymy in these groups can not be attained by the mere comparison of external anatomical parts in museum material types or otherwise It will henceforth be simply a waste of time energy paper and ink to put forth such re sults without correlation with the other char acters mentioned and I will therefore not dis cuss here the merits of the points raised in these notes of most of which I have very serious doubt But I shall return to these points as soon as I can secure proper material for the necessary dissections If students wish to further the interests and advance the status of muscoid taxonomy let them collect rear and dissect long series of specimens from the type localities concerned they will then be in a position to deduce final synonymical conclusions Any other course in the present stage of progress of the work will only further obscure the subject The same ground will all have to be covered again and all raised or unraised points thoroughly probed to the bottom In the study of these flies no matter who agrees as to synonymy whether generic or specific if they have not done their work exhaustively their agreement is of slight interest to the matter in hand 4Psyche October 1910 The statement that I am going to make now will probably astonish some people but I can truthfully say that I would be greatly pleased to see half the generic and specific names that have been proposed in the Muscoidea safely relegated to the synonymy where they could rest undisturbed and buried forever with no hope of a resurrection a goodly sprinkling of my own among the number but such a con siderable reduction of names is hardly possible of realization Looking toward a consumma tion of final synonymy however I shall hope to accomplish in the next few years some por tion of the work necessary to this end during the course of which I here pledge my word that those generic and specific names of my own making will receive the same impartial treatment at my hands as all others My one wish in this matter is to secure certainty be fore putting a name into the synonymy The making of incorrect synonymy is a much more serious taxonomic offense than proposing fur ther names for forms already named In the latter case the forms can always be definitely referred to by means of the names that have been bestowed upon them but in the former case serious confusion is certain to ensue The main interest here as elsewhere in biol ogy centers in the relationships phylogeny bionomics and kindred aspects of the forms and this knowledge must point the way to a sound taxonomy In many groups of organ isms this knowledge largely follows a fairly stable system of classification but here it must precede it It only remains to impress re peatedly upon the student the extreme diffi culty at best of rightly interpreting the char acters in such a multitude of forms many of which are closely similar in the adult the at least present impossibility in many cases of separating these forms on external adult char acters alone and therefore the absolute neces sity for making an exhaustive study with ref erence to all taxonomically utilitarian charac ters external and internal of all stages Let no one think that I have overestimated the needs of this subject in the foregoing remarks I further wish to say in conclusion 862 SCIENCEJUNE 2 1911 SCIENCE that without doubt all biologists myself in cluded will take great pleasure and satisfac tion in welcoming to this field all careful workers whose services should be much appre ciated where there is such a vast amount of labor waiting to be performed CHARLES H T TOWNSEND PIURA PERT January 29 1911 SPECIAL ARTICLES METAMORPHOSIS WITHOUT PARASITISM IN THE UNIONIDiE IT has been known for a long time that in the genus Strophitus Rafinesque the embryos and glochidia are embedded in short cylindri cal cords which are composed of a semitrans lucent gelatinous substance and that these cords which are closely packed together like chalk crayons in a box lie transversely in the watertubes of the marsupium The blunt ends of the cords are seen through the thin lamella of the outer gill which in this genus as in Anodonta and others constitutes the marsupium The position of the masses of embryos while contained within the gill is so unusual that Simpson in his  Synopsis of the Naiades established a special group the Diagenae for Strophitusthe only genus of the family in which this peculiarity exists In other genera the embryos are conglutinated more or less closely to form flat plates or cylindrical masses each one of which is con tained in a separate watertube and lies ver tically in the marsupium So far as we are aware Isaac Lea1 was the first to observe this interesting arrangement which he described and figured rather crudely to be sure in Strophitus undulatus Anodonta undulata In several subsequent communi cations2 he added further details and illustra tions and also mentioned the occurrence of the transversely placed cords or sacks as he called them in S edentulus He recorded the former species as being gravid from Septem ber until March and described the extrusion 1  Observations on the Genus Unio Vol II 1838 2Ibid Vols VI X 1858 1863 of the cords from the female as well as the remarkable emergence of the glochidia from the interior of the cords after the latter have been discharged  The sacks were discharged into the water by the parent he says  from day to day for about a month in the middle of winter Eight or ten young were generally in each sack but some were so short as only to have room for one or two    Immediately when the sacks came out from between the valves of the parent most of the young were seen to be attached by the dorsal margin to the outer portion of the sack as if it were a placenta The essential points in these observations have since been verified by other investigators Sterki following the suggestion of Lea has called the cords which differ strikingly from the conglutinated masses of Unio and other genera placentae thus indicating that he considered them to have a nutritive function He also described the extrusion of the glo chidia when placed in water and their at tachment to the cord  by a short byssus thread whose proximal end is attached to the soft parts of the young He further states that the glochidia are enclosed in the pla centse when the latter are first discharged and that after their extrusion they remain at tached for some time Ortmann4 in a paper on the breeding sea sons of the Unionidse of Pennsylvania says of S undulatus which he regards as identical with edentulus I found this species gravid in the months of July August September October also in May The latest date is May 22 1908 one out of eleven individuals Among numerous specimens col lected on May 14 and May 27 1908 no gravid females were present and during the month of June such were never found although a good number of specimens were collected The earliest date again is July 11 This gives an interim from the end of May to about the middle of July In a later paper Ortmann5 states that the discharge of the cords which he proposes to 8 Nautilus Vol XII 1898 Ibid Vol XXII 1909 Ibid Vol XXIII 1910 863

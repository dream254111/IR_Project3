justly considered one of the triumphs of physiological psychology to have made the ele mentary processes involved in perceiving and think ing more real and better known by comparing the times necessary for their performance It has made the connection between mental action and the function of the brain closer by showing that all processes take time and that this time is varied by abnormal conditions of the brain These psy chometrical observations though of but recent date form one of the favorite fields of present psychological research The usual method of measuring ones reaction time is somewhat as follows The subject is seated with his hand in contact with an electric key his attention is to be directed we will say to a flash of light electrically produced before him The operator controls the appearance of the spark by simply breaking an electric connection at the same instant he sets in motion by the same current a Hipp chronoscopel which in turn is stopped im mediately on the closure of the key by the subject The interval during which the clock was recording will then be the time necessary for the subject to perceive the light But in this time several ele ments are involved These can be separately in vestigated by other means We have 1 a series of afferent processes such as the time necessary for the senseorgan in this case the retina 2 to be affected the time necessary for the impulse to travel along the sensory nerves to the brain 2 the reception of the sensation in the brain plus perhaps the generation of the will and 3 a series of afferent phenomena including the trans mission of the impulse from the brain to the spinal cord down the cord to the anterior nerveroots thence along the afferent nerves to the muscles the latent time of the muscles and finally the contraction of the muscles closing the key The phenomenon in which the psychologist is interested 1 This is an instrument which by a clockwork arrange ment records to the thousandth of a second It is set in motion electrically by the release of a magnet and stopped by the closure of the same A tuning fork recording on a revolving drum or similar arrangement is often used in its place 2 If the stimulus excited the touch we should also have the time for transmission along the nerve to the spinal cord and the slow travelling up the cord is included under 2 But to determine that he must eliminate 1 and 3 And here we see how essentially physiological a real psychology is it has need of facts which none but a physiologist would undertake to discover We want to know the rate at which the nervous impulse travels This Helm holtz measured in 1850 only a few years after Jo hannes Muller despaired of our ever ascertaining it and found to be about 33 metres 108 feet per sec ond for both motor and sensory nerves The trav elling along the cord is much slower  about 10 metres 33 feet per second The very minute times involved in the delay in the senseorgan ganglion of the spinal nerves and muscle have also been accurately determined The whole operation ie the complete reaction time takes about a of a second of which the process included under 2 consumes a share subject to great varia tion according to the conditions of the experi ment but always small Let the operation be somewhat more complex Say that the light shall not always be of the samne kind but that at times it shall be red and at times blue The subject is not to react until he has per ceived the blueness or redness of the light If we subtract the simple reaction time from the total time intervening between the appearance of the colored light and the closing of the key after the subject has seen whether it is a red or a blue light we shall have the time required to distinguish red from blue This we will call the distinction time We can evidently make the distinction more difficult by having three four or more colors The average distinction time between two sensations though largely variable is about from to I of a second or less In the above experiment it has been assumed that the nature of the reaction has remained un altered that is in each case the subject closed the one key before him This too is capable of com plication We can agree that the subject is to react by a key on his right hand if a red light appears and by one on his left if a blue light ap pears If we subtract the time necessary for all the processes up to the color distinction from the time required to close the appropriate key we shall obtain the time necessary for making a choice be tween two reactions While before we were test ing the readiness of the subjects sensibility and of his judgment we are now testing the alertness of his will That time necessary for this new pro cess we will call the  choice time According to238 SCIENCE Wundt it is a little longer than the distinction time and like it is very mnuch affected by differ ent conditions of mind and varies largely in dif ferent individuals It too can be complicated by making the choice between three four or several modes of reaction Only one more type of reaction time will be here mentioned It is called an association time and is measured as follows A word is called and simultaneous with the call the clockwork is set in motion As soon as possible after the word is heard the subject answers by uttering the first word associated with the callword that suggests itself to him By subtracting from this time the time necessary for the hearing of the first word and the utterance of the secondwe have the time involved in the process of association or the as sociation time This is a very much more compli cated process and naturally occupies a longer time  about I of a second It differs largely in different states of mind and in individuals It can be complicated by restricting the kind of words allowable as associations For example only words related to the callword as part to whole may be allowed We thus test what may be termed the suggestiveness or coordination of ones mental furniture All these reaction times have been measured in laboratories under somewhat artificial conditions and with the aid of more or less elaborate appara tus It has long been desirable to avoid this arti ficiality and thus make the inferences from such experiments to similar processes in our daily thought more certain and immediate and to sim plify the apparatus so that the demonstration of these mental times may be easy and inexpensive It is to describe an attempt at solving these diffi culties with reference to a few types of reaction times that I devote this article My method is a very simple one We require delicate apparatus because we have to measure very small fractions of a second  and this in turn is necessary because we measure but a single reaction time at once By measuring a long series of successive reactions we can dispense with deli cate time apparatus for the error involved by such neglect will be divided among the whole series and will thus not appreciably affect the value of the average reaction time For our pur poses a small clock or a watch beating quarter seconds as a rule is sufficiently accurate One can readily count four to the second and the pro cess can be made still easier by tallying off the  tens by pencilmarks or on ones fingers It is advisable in counting to emphasize alternate num bers thus one two three four five six etc We shall find incidentally that the conditions VOL VIII No 188 suitable for such experimentation are uncon strained and natural The method is applicable to all the kinds of reaction times above described 1 Simple reaction times Here I have but a single experiment to offer On one occasion I im posed sufficiently on the good nature of an even ing company of about eighteen persons to ask them to arrange themselves in a circle each one stand ing with the forefinger of one hand resting upon the shoulder of the person before him At a given signal one of the party gently pressed with his finger upon his neighbors shoulder who in turn communicated the impression as soon as he felt it to the shoulder of the one before him and so on around the circle The impression made four or five complete revolutions and the time was taken to the nearest quarter of a second By dividing the time by the product of the number of revolu tions of the impression into the number of persons one obtains the average simple reaction time for a touch impression A little drill would be necessary before the time would be constant inas much as a miscellaneous set of persons do not readily act together without rehearsals My time was about t of a second but it would evidently have been shorter could I have repeated the ex periment It is recommended as a useful evening amusement There is one point more if the reac tion time of any particular individual is desired one has only to subtract from the average time of one revolution of a circle in which he forms a member the time of a revolution of the impres sion in which he is absent 2 Distinction time  The apparatus consists of a clock ticking quarterseconds a stopwatch is much more convenient and several packs of ordi nary playingcards To begin with a very simple case Take a single pack of cards throw out all the face cards and you have forty cards left of which twenty are red and twenty black Shuffle these well together Let the assistant be ready with the clock close to his ear to give you a signal when to begin and to count the ticks The  one by which he begins his counting is a good signal1 The moment you hear the word  one you throw the first of the forty cards upon the table and con tinue to do so with the rest distributing them into two heaps As you throw the last card you call  Done  whereupon the assistant closes his count ing The cards must be divided without any plan between the two heaps  about as a chance arrange ment would divide them The time consumed in this operation divided by the number of cards will be spoken of as the  throwing time What naturally suggests itself as the next opera 1 It is advisable to prepare the subject for the signal by previously calling Ready IS CIENCXGJE tion is to repeat the process by which the throw ing time was obtained with the difference that the card is not to be depoited before the thrower has appreciated the color whether red or black of each card to be thrown The time necessary for this process minus the throwing time would be the time which it took the person to distinguish red from black But this method is really not valid at all and for the following reason While throwing one card one can in the indirect field of attention so to say be preparing to decide or already deciding what the color of the following card is so that the two operations of throwing and distinguishing partly overlap A distinctioh time gotten by such a proceeding would be en tirely too short Several ways of avoiding this difficulty were suggested of which I used the fol lowing one The cards were held with the backs towards the thrower The operation consisted first in simply turning the card with its face up ward and depositing it on a heap and second in not depositing it before its color has been seen In this way the person cannot see the following card because it has its back towards him  and all the cards may be placed on a single heap The average difference between the time required for the first operation and that for the second divided by the number of cards will give the distinction time for distinguishing red from black1 I have described the simplest type of a distinc tion time The process can be indefinitely com plicated by having three four or more colors to distinguish using the backs of variously colored cards or by distinguishing the four suits of one pack By having several packs of cards one can vary the experiments in very many ways One can distinguish as many of the spotcards as one pleases from two to ten can in addition to this distinction distinguish between the suits and so on Before giving the results I have obtained in this way I will anticipate the question whether the number of cards used will not affect the result It probably will for the mind being once set on the habit of making these distinctions can keep up the process with less energy and thus with greater rapidity This question I hope to solve by a special 1 In another method the forty cards are spread out upon a table say in five rows of eight each The subject first runs his eye along each row going forward on one row and back ward on the next dwelling on each card only long enough to bring it into distinct vision The operation is very rapid being faster than counting but is rather uncertain Next he  reads  the color of each card in the same manner The difference between the times necessary for these operations evidently again gives the distinction time Here too reading ahead in indirect vision is possible but not to any great extent The method is of value only as a means of checking the results of the first method but is inferior to it Doubtless some of my readers will invent a method better than this or the one described in the text 239 set of experiments From what I have done I am able to say that the variation will be extremely slight It is recommended to use forty or sixty cards as it is easy to hold that numnber in ones hand and these numbers are divisible by 2 3 4 5 and the latter by 6 Moreover I or I of the error involved in neglecting fractions of a second less than a quarter is a small error indeed The persons whose reaction times were taken were I a girl of ten years II a young lady and III myself In all the experiments in which II and III took part sixty cards and in all in which I was the subject forty cards were used In the following table the time is always given in seconds 5sfm 9s  2s 4 s 2s 4s 1s 2s 2s 4s1 6s 8s 4s 6s n o etc 6s 6s 8s  etc  s 8s 10s 8s 10s S I 058 097 159 250  036 II 045 073 078 089 110 037 III 043 054 061 068 074 021 The column headed 5s from 9s 2s from 4s etc indicates that the pack of cards was divided equally between twospots and fourspots or five spots and ninespots or some similar combination of two kinds of cards and that the subject had to distinguish by the method above described the denomination of each card It thus appears that it took I 058 of a second to make this distinction and II and III 045 and 043 of a second respec tively In other words it takes  of a second to tell whether a card is a fivespot or a ninespot or to make any similar distinction The only experiment performed by the usual laboratory methods which I could find comparable with this was one by Professor Wundt undertaken in his psychological laboratory at Leipzig in which the distinction was made between a black cross on a white background and a white cross on a black background He gives 0485 of a second as the distinction time which agrees well with 044 the average of the times of the two adults in the above table The distinction between the green and blue backs of cards as is shown by the last column of the table is more rapidly made Perhaps part of the difference is due to the fact that the card did not need to to be turned so completely around to see the color as to see the denomination In the other columns of the table is shown the result of a series of experiments in which the cards were divided among three four five or six kinds as indicated in the heading It is seen that though the thing to be done remains the same SEPTEMBER 10 1886240 SCIENrCE namiely to read the denomination of each card yet it takes longer to do so the greater the number of denominations to which it may belong1 One must take a longer look at a card to tell that it is a fourspot for instance where it may be a one two four six eight or ten than when it may be a two four or six This difference was most marked with me in passing from two to three kinds The increasing number of possibilities is more puzzling to the little girl than to the others for it takes her as much as  of a second to tell the cards when five denominations are used whereas it takes the others only about 3 of a second A few words of caution must be added for those who intend to repeat the experiments Do not expect very constant results at first the famil iarity which one acquires after the second or third trial very much reduces the time after this there is a more gradual reduction due to practice The numbers in the table are regular only because founded on many sets of experiments and the first few records of each kind of reaction are omitted in a few cases 3 Choice time  This time is obtained by an indirect process We have already become ac quainted with the  throwing time This time has no particular psychological interest as it simply tells how long it takes one to throw out cards This time will differ very largely in different persons and is much reduced by practice It took I 2 of a second II A of a second and III I of a second to throw a card upon one of two heaps It takes longer to distribute the cards the more numerous the heaps among which they are to be divided but the increase in time is slight It took I less than  of a second to place a card in one of five heaps and II and III 3 and 1 of a second respectively when six heaps were used Of course the time refers to the simple operation of placing the cards without reference to their de nomination in one of a certain number of heaps Each of these counts has a different mode of reac tion Having gotten the throwing time the next step is to distribute the cards among the heaps in such a way that each heap will contain but one kind of cards If we are throwing fivespots and nine spots then all the fivespots must be put on one heap and all the ninespots on the other If we are using two four six and eight spots then there will be four heaps each containing all the cards of one denomination In addition to the time con 1 The only comparable experiment and the similarity is not very close I can find is one recently published by Dr Cattell in which he finds that it takes only about 1160 of a second longer to distinguish one out of ten than one out of two colors VOL VIII No 188 sumed by the manual operation of taking the card and placing it on the pack part of the time is con sumed in recognizing the denomination of the card and the rest in placing it on its appropriate pack In other words if from the time occupied by this operation we subtract the throwing time we have left the distinction time together with the choice time But we know the value of the distinction time by our previous experiments Simple sub traction yields the choice time I will again put the results in the form of a table I sfm9 sC 4 2 s 4 2s 4s 1s 2s g  s 4 s6s I 6 s 8 s 4s 6s  o etc 6s 6s 8s 10s 8s 10s 4 I 062

operation but the increase is more rapid in this table than in the former one This is just what we should expect for in the former case it was the same process to be done under different conditions while here the nature of the reaction is changed with each addi tional kind of card When we deal with but two kinds of cards the choice time and the distinction time are about equal This agrees well with Pro fessor Wundts results1 The process readily be comes at least partly automatic But as we pass to a choice between three kinds of reactions it would seem that a distinct exertion of the will is necessary in each case The time undergoes a marked increase From that point on the increase in time with the complexity of the operation is mnore gradual But as before the little girl finds great difficulty in distributing the cards appropri ately when many kinds are used It takes her over  of a second to determine upon which of five heaps to put a card after she knows its denomina tion while it only takes the others  and y5 of a second to perform the same operation with six heaps A comparison of the first and last columns of the table shows the regularity of the phenomena we are studying The choice time ought not of course to be affected by the nature of the distinc tion upon which it is founded and the choice time for fivespots and ninespots and that for green and blue ought to be and are approximately 1 It is again difficult to find comparable results But the distinction plus choice time can be compared with similar results of Dr Cattell His figure is 078 mine is 081AS CIECE alike WTe thus have a means of varying one with out the other The independence of the two pro cesses distinction and choice is further shown by the fact that II is the quickest distinguisher while III is the most ready chooser III is slow est in both operations but differs less in the readi ness of her sensibility and judgment than in the alertness of her will Perhaps an educational truth with regard to the development of the mental powers is hinted at here 4 Association time Here our apparatus re duces itself to a clock and some slips of paper but the number of persons involved in the experi ments must be increased from two to three Let each of the three write on the slips of paper ten or twenty words say of one syllable each and the names of concrete things Avoid any natural con nection between the words bynot writing them in the order in which they were thought of Now let I and IX be the subjects of the experiment while III records the time 1 Let I begin by calling as soon as he hears the signal the first word on his list hereupon II answers by the first word which he can associate with the call word and immediately upon this calls his first word to I who in turn performs the association and calls his second word and so on to the end If there are ten words on the list of each then each person has called ten words has answered ten words and has performed ten associations 2 Now let I and II each have twenty words before him and let each call a word as soon as he hears the answer of the other1 This operation will dif fer from the former only by the fact that the association has been omitted The difference in time between 2 and 1 divided by 10 will give the sum of the association times of I and II Now let I and III be the subjects and II take the time and the sum of the association times of I and III will be obtained Then get the sum of the times for II and III and the solution of a very simple algebraic equation will give the value of the association time of each I have also used another perhaps somewhat simpler method It differs only in that in each operation one person acts as caller and the other as associater throughout In this way the values of six equations are gotten i e I caller  II associater   II caller  I associater   and so with each pair We then eliminate the value of I caller  II caller etc by getting the value of the three equations  I caller  II caller I caller III caller etc just as before The results of the two methods agree very well and one may be used as a check upon 1 The words should be pronounced distinctly and no more rapidly than in the first operation 241 the results of the other The effect of practice in reducing the time is at first very considerable It remains to be noted that after I have ascer tained my own association time and my own call ing time and know it to be fairly constant the work of finding the reaction time of a fourth person is much reduced We have simply to get the sum of our association times and of our calling times and subtract from these my own association and my own calling time I will give the results of the first method because here alone is the effect of practice in two of the subjects eliminated The subjects are the II and III of our former experiments and the times are 803 and 872 of a second respectively which agrees very well with 764 of a second which is the time found by Professor Wundt by the more elaborate methods The great difference between this time and that necessary for a distinction or a choice shows how much more elaborate the former pro cess is The methods above described leave much to be desired but the principle upon which they depend namely of substituting a series of reactions for a single one and of arranging the apparatus so that the subject himself produces the sensations upon which the distinction and choice is made seems to be the one by which the desired simplification can be best accomplished If the above account shall be the means of setting others to work at the same problem and of popularizing to any extent the study of experimental psychology its object will be more than fulfilled JOSEPH JASTROW TITE HYGIENE OF THE VOCAL ORGANS THE experience which Dr Mackenzie has had for the past twentyfive years as a specialist in the treatment of diseases of the throat renders him thoroughly competent to advise on the im portant subject of which he treats in the volume before us Additional interest attaches to his utterances for the reason that during this active career the most famous singers have come under his professional care and observation including Nilsson Albani Vallina Patti and a host of others Dr Mackenzie well says that hygiene has a positive as well as a negative side The preserva tion of health means not only that actual mischief is avoided but that the body is kept in the best working order The hygiene of the voice there fore must include a consideration of the

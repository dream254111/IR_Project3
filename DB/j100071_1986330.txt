THREEPARAMETER GROUPS OF A CUBIC SPACE CURVE AND A QUADRIC SURFACE BY A B COBLE t  1 Statement of the problem h As is well known there is a threeparameter group G of projective trans formations which leaves unaltered a cubic curve C3 in a space of three dimen sions S3 The group F3 of algebraic transformations reciprocal to G3 also leaves C3 unaltered The sixparameter projective group which leaves a quadric Q in a three dimensional space I unaltered contains two threeparameter subgroups F3 and P  each of which is defined by its leaving uinaltered every one of a set of generators of Q That the groups G3 and P3 are similar LIE has pointed out He has given also a transformationi which carries the one group into the other But the form of this transformation is not such as to permit of an easy discussioni of its properties It is the object of this paper to set forth a transformation T which carries G3 into I3 in such a form that its effect upon the various manifolds in S3 and 1 may be more easily studied This object will be effected by first obtainiing the integral equations of G3 and F3 in readily comparable forms Possibly the chief interest of the method lies in the fact that the algebraic trans formation T will also transform the projective group CF3 into the algebraic group F3 Properties of F3 may then through the knowledge of T be inferred from those of 433  2 The trilinear

notation The forms p1x3 p2X3 etc denote fixed points and their comitants are distin guished from those of pX3 by the use of the respective suffix A point on C3 is given simply by a linear form Then we can state that 1 pp13  0 is a plane cutting C3 in the points X1x 1 lx vlx and passing through pl 3x 2 r  0 is the ruled suface of tangents of C3 and contains 03 as a cuspidal edge Or it is an algebraic surface of the fourth order containing C3 as a double doubly asymptotic curve Here we understand by an mtuple ptuply asymptotic curve on a surface a curve of mtuple points such that the tangent cone of order m at every point on the curve contains the osculating plane of the curve at that point p times 3 qp13  0 is the polar cubic surface of p1 X3 as to r  0 It contains C3 as an

three binary forms lx mx nx for which always the identity 1 lx  mx  nx 0 holds and therefore 2 mn nl m we have as the equation of a quadric Q 3 mn nl 1m 0 A system of generators say the hgenerators of Q is given by the identity 4 plx  afmx Jr Tnx O pOr 7 1 1 1  By the use of 1 identity 4 may be written in infinitely many forms but we shall take usually that one for which p  a  T  0 The hgenerators are then determined by a binary value svstem p a r Three of these generators denoted hereafter by a b and c respectively and given analytically by  3lx  2lx  mx  ntx 0 5 3mx lx  2rnx  nx 0 3nx lx  mx 2nx 0 will be called the principal generators The Hessiain pair Ha b c of these three are 6 lX  CnX  w2nx  0 IX  w2mX  conx  0 where c is an imaginary cube root of unity The generators forming the cubic covariant of the principal generators denoted respectively by a b c are 7 m  nx o nx  lx  0 lx  mx  06 COBLE RELATION BETWEEN THE THREEPARAMIETER GROUPS January The second system of generators say the Kgenerators of Q is defined by the simultaneous holding of 8 1u O mu 0 nuO ini which ul u2 is an arbitrary but fixed value Any one equation of 8 is a consequence of the other two The Ksystem is thus also determined by a binary value system u1 u2 The plane 9 plu  mu  nu 0 is a tangent plane of Q containing the hgenerator p a 7 and the Kgenera tor u Then the tangent planes conitaining a and the Kgenierator 1 b and the Kgenerator m c and the Kgenerator n are respectively Yl  0 Mm  0 and nn  0 and they meet in the point whose coordinates are 1x mx inx Thus if the principal generators are fixed as well as a binary value system on any one of them then our co6rdinate system is fixed If the 1 i n are permuted in all possible ways six points are obtained cor responding to the six possible ways of co6rdinating the three Kgenerators with a b c Such a set of points will be called a 6point and be said to be defined by a 3K 1 m n By very simple analysis we verify that in general 10 A 6point 1 m n lies on two lines which form the diagonals of the skew quadlrilateral on Q whose sides are Ha b c and the Hessian pair of the 3K 1 m n These two lines are conjugate lines of Q anzd each intersects Q in the Hessian pair of the three points on it The construction of a 6point just given is niot valid if mnnllmO The point then has co6rdinates p ux a ux Tux where p1  a1 r  0 and lies on a Kgenerator u aind an hgenerator p a 7 where p  a  T  0 and pp1  vaa1  I 0 In general the three quantities p a 7 are distinct and different from zero and the 6point is the six intersections of the Kgenera tor un with the six hgenerators obtained by permuting p a 7 But if p a  2   1 the 6point is the three ineets of a b c with the Kgene rator u if p    0 1 1 the 6point is the three mieets of a b c with Kuh while if p   1  c CW2 the 6point is the two meets of Ha b c with Ku The equation of a plane in 3 may always by the use of 1 be put in the form ll 1  mnai  nqi O so that the coefficients or plane coordinates Ix Mrx 77x also satisfy the identity 1 Hence as for points we have 6planes whose coordinates are the permutations of the coordinates of any one of the six 12 Each plane of the 6plane 1 m n passes thraough a line of the 6point 1 m n and ca point on the other line This relatiion of the two is reciprocal1906 OF A CUBIC SPACE CURVE AND A QUADRIC SURFACE 7 The constructiont of the 6plane is entirely dual to that of the 6point except that either the a b c take the place of a b c or the cubic covarianit of the 3K 1 m  n takes the place of the 3K itself The polar planes as to Q of a 6point 1 m n foerm a 6placne m  n n 1 1 m whose construction is entirely dual to that of the 6point The identities in x 13 1x  dl8x mWx  dm x n x dnx in whiclh as before dyax  0 is the general linear transformation in the binary dornain represent a transfornmation of the point 1 m n into the point 1 nm n which leaves unaltered both the identities 1 and 4 and therefore every generator h

interchangeable with any transformation of g6 and D and the transfor mations of g6 are the only transformations of 1 3 which carry 6points into 6points  5 The transformation T A comparison of the integral equations of 03 anI F obtained above suggests at once the transformation T which carries the one group into the other Introducing for convenience later a factor of proportionality we will define T by means of the identities 3 3 1 mn2  1     vx  2 2nx viewing this as a tranisformation of the space S3 into the space 3 The form is so simple however that we may also consider 1 as T the inverse of T which tranisforms the space 1 3 into the space S3 Since Xx lx vx are definied only to within a permutation we have 2 T is an algebraic transformation of the space S3 into 13 one point of S3 being tr ansformed into a 6point of E3 By T one point of 3 is transformed into one point of S3 T transforms the sixtuply transitive groutp G into the simply transitive gr oup F3  By a well known theorem T will then transform the group D3 reciprocal to F3 into the group F3 reciprocal to G3 whence from 15  4 we have the identities Xx  a2tx  a3vx 3 0 b3vx  b1XX  V X  C1 Xx  C2  Zx  in which b1

when we consider both T and its inverse The indeterminateness of T is due partly to the explicit factor 3mn 2 anld partly to the factor cT   V r employed in the definition of Xx Ix vx If we consider only the ratios of X F v and of 1 m n we may say that 17 To every point on a tangent to C at xl corresponds by T the three points of Q in which the Kgenerator X1x meets a b c while to a point of C3 corresponds no definite points in 3 Inversely to every point of Q on the K generator X1x corresponds by T1 the point Xlx of O3 except that to a point on a b or c corresponds no definite point of S3 In connection with the general theorems 5 and 6 of  3 we have the following 18 A surface of order n in 83 which contains G3 as an mtuple ptuply asymp totic curve is transfornmed by T into a surface in 3

by T into curves in  which admit through every point at least one triple secant for they are made up of 6points We will consider only the lines of S3 A line in general position the intersection of two planes is tranisformed by T into the intersection of two cubic surfaces of the system 11 Helnce 19 To a line in general position in 53 there correspond by T a curve of the sixth order which meets Q in the twelve points common to a b c and the four Kgenerators defined by the tangents of C3 met by the original line Through every poitnt of the curve passes a triple secant whose conjugate line as to Q is another triple secant a b c are quadrisecants of the curve If the line in S3 is a tan gent line of r  0 in general position two of the Jbur Kcgenerators coincide Since a tanoett of C0 at ax is the

corresponds in 3 the Kgenerator ax count ing six times A chord of C3 is the pencil of cubics p1x3  Xq1X3 and it meets C3 at ol x and TX Fronm the properties of the 6point it follows that 21 To a chord qf C3 corresponds in 1 3 the two lines of a 6point whtich are diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by H a b c and the Kgenerators o x and Tlx andfurther these two Kgenerators each counting twice A secant of 03 at blx may be taken as part intersection of the quadric 3a 2  0 and the plane pbl pal2  0 where a x is a factor of ax 2 To the plane corresponds in 3S a cubic surface with the Kgenerator a1x as a double line while to Sa 2 0 correspolnds a quadric with this generator as a single line The remaining intersection duie to the secant at blx is a curve of the fourth order and second kind In the general curve of this type it hap pens four times that triple secants become tangent secants But triple secants arising from 6points cannot so degenerate and in fact the four tangent secants are replaced by two flex tangents For let the secant of 03 be given as the intersection of the two planes pbl pX pp1  0 and  pbl pX2 pi2  0 We verify easily that the corresponding cubic surfaces in 3touch along the cgenerator The remaining meet a curve of fourth order meets Q in eight points six of which correspond to the two intersections of the original chord with r  0 and lie on a b c The other two are the meets of the Kgenerator blx with Ha b c That they are flexes we may deduce from the follow ing limit considerations As the variable point on the chord of C3 approaches bx its Hessian tends to a limiting value whose factors are bx and the polar of  b x  as to  cX 2 the pair apolar to both X 1x  a1 x anid X x a2 x Three of the 6point cluster around the onie point where the Kgenerator b x

effect of T1 upon the simpler manifolds the planes and lines of 3 The results obtained will be sufficient to exhibit some of the properties of the alge braic group F3 In general it may be said that a manifold of order n Mn in 3 must be considered in connection with the others obtained by replacing each point by the 6poinit to which it belongs The 6Mn so obtained rather than the orig inial Pn alone is tranisformed by T into a manifold 31 in 83 If the order of 31 be m a line cuts it in m points in general position In 3 then a sextic curve cuts the 63ln in 6m points whence 6mi 36n 1 T carries an

the 6K3 p21 falls into two sets of three one set all passing through Pl1 and P21 the other through P12 and P22  The three pairs of points in which the three curves of one set osculates CO are in an

p2 have as part of their common curve a definite second K3 which oscu lates C3 at the same poiuts as the first Two such K 3 which are moreover recip rocally related to each other will be called  conjugate  8 The algebraic group F3 The equations of this group are given by 3  5 but we naturally prefer to obtain its properties from those of 3 1a  4 by means of T and T1 From  6 and  7 the translation is in most cases quite obvious Unless definitely stated otherwise the following theorems refer to a general transforma tion of F3 denoted by F  1 Under the group F3 there is a pefect duality between the point and sextic surface S6p1 t between the 6K3 and the 6K3 A pair of conjugate K3s are selfdual 2 A point p1 is transfjormed by F into six points which lie by threes on two conqjugate K3s each of which osculates C3 at the two meets of C3 wiith its chord through p1 3 A sextic S6p1 is transformed by F into six such sextics which pass by threes through two conjugate K3s osculating C3 at its two intersections with its chord through p1  4 A K3 through a point p1 is transformed by F into six K3s each of which osculates C3 at the same points as the original K3 and passes through one of the transforms of p1 5 Thle system of sextics S6p1 and the system of cubic curves K3 are the manifolds of lowest degree which are transformed among each other by the trans formations of F3  This transformation will be viewed in a different manner from that customary in the theory of LIE From the equations of the group we see that the coordinates of the transformed point  p X3  r  2 x IL X  vx  are sixvalued functions of the coordinates of the original point These algebraic functions have for branch points the entire surface r  0 On every manifold then of dimensions greater than zero will lie some of these singular points So that it seems at any rate when manifolds are in question  simpler and more in accord with the nature of the group to consider the various branches of the algebraic functions simultaneously This requires however an extended definition of a group For if a point is transformed by F into six points the successive performance of two transformations of the group is equivalent to the simultaneous performance of a finite number in the present case generally six of transformations of thegrouip Or using the word transformation in the ordinary sense we may say that the transformations of F3 fall into sets of six and such a set will be denoted by F t We assume of course that the points curves and surfaces considered in 1 2 3 and 4 are general i e have no particular situation with regard to r  020 COBLE GROUPS OF A CURVE AND A SURFACE For any surface in S3 is transformed by T into a surface of order 3n  4m  2p in 23 which has however a particular situation with regard to the triple of generator a b c or its covariants This special situation is destroyed by a transformation of 13 and the transformed surface is carried again by T into a surface in F of degree greater than n For example 6 A plane in S3 is transformed by F into a surface of order 18 which con taims C3 as a sixtuple sixtuply asymptotic curve with seventuple points at the intersections of the original plane with C3 Hence the requiired manifolds of lowest degree in A3 arise from general mani folds of lowest degree in 3 namely the planes and lines In order to characterize more completely the six curves into which a IK3 is transformed by F we may introduce the doubly infinite system of sextics 13  7 any one of which will be denoted by 26 or 26 t1 st On an S6pl lies a doubly infinite system of K3 each of which is characterized by its two points of osculation with C3 On a 6t1st there is also a doubly infinite system of K3 all of which osculate C3 at tlx Two 26 intersect also in six K3 and we have 7 A K3 osculating C3 att1 x and t2 x is transformed by F into six curves K3 which foam the complete intersection of two definite sextics 6tlst and t2 st These results seem sufficient to demonstrate the value of the canonical forms employed for the various groups For the sake of brevity no reference has been made to the transformation S as it appears in the space S3 where with G3 and F3 it generates a sixparameter algebraic group BONN August 1904

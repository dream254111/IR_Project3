CUNDUS EXTRACTED AND TRANSLATED FROM THE LATIN OF PROFESSOR GMELIN BY W WATSON F R S THIS VOLUME OF THE FLORA SIBIRICA NOW UNDER CONSIDERATION CONTAINS TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY PAGES IN QUARTO EXCLUSIVE OF THE PREFACE AND NINETYEIGHT COPPER PLATES VERY CU RIOUSLY ENGRAVED IT WAS PRINTED AT PETERSBURG IN THE YEAR 1749 READ APRIL 12 1753 AN ACCOUNT OF THE FIRST VOLUME OF THIS VALUABLE WORK WAS COMMUNICATED TO THE SOCIETY BY MY LEARNED AND INGENIOUS FRIEND DR JOHN FOTHERGILL  AND HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FROM ITS TITLE WE ARE ONLY PROMISED AN ACCOUNT OF THE PLANTS OF SIBIRIA BUT DR JOHN GEORGE GMELIN ITS AUTHOR AT  SEE PHIL TRANS VOL XLV PAG 248142 AT THAT TIME PROFESSOR OF CHEMISTRY AND NATURAL HISTORY AT PETERSBURG AND NOW AT TUBINGEN WENT MUCH FAR THER AND HAS GIVEN US A VERY GREAT NUMBER OF NEW CURIOUS AND USEFUL OBSERVATIONS CONCERNING THE NA TURAL HISTORY OF THAT VAST AND UNKNOWN REGION THE ABUNDANCE OF MATTER AND THE LIMITS OF AN EXTRACT OBLIGED DR FOTHERGILL TO CONFINE HIMSELF PRINCIPALLY TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL PART OF THE WORK BUT AS THE CONTENTS OF THE SECOND VOLUME ARE CHIEFLY BOTANICAL I FIND MYSELF OBLIGED TO TAKE A RE VIEW OF THE FIRST VOLUME TO INTRODUCE WITH PROPRIETY AN ACCOUNT OF THE CONTENTS OF THE SECOND THE FLORA SIBIRICA CONTAINS THE PLANTS WHICH GROW SPONTANEOUSLY IN A REGION OF VAST EXTENT BOUNDED BY THE VRALENSIAN MOUNTAINS ON THE WEST THE OCEAN OF KAMTSCHATKA ON THE EAST THE MARE GLACIALE ON THE NORTH THE COUNTRIES OF KALMUCKS AND MONGALES AND THE CONFINES OF CHINA ON THE SOUTH OUR AUTHOR HAS AMONG THE PRODUCTIONS OF THESE COUNTRIES INTER SPERSED A FEW PLANTS COLLECTED BY THAT EXCELLENT BOTA NIST GERBER NEAR THE RIVERS DON AND WOLGA AND IN THE UKRAINE PARTLY BECAUSE MANY OF THE SAME KIND GROW IN SIBIRIA AND PARTLY FROM A DESIRE THAT THESE CURIOUS PLANTS SHOULD NO LONGER BE CONCEALED FROM THE PUBLIC HE HAS GIVEN NO PLANT A PLACE WHICH HE HIMSELF HATH NOT EXAMINED AT LEAST IN A DRIED STATE AND OF WHICH HE IS NOT SATISFIED OF ITS GENERICAL CHA RACTER THE PLANTS OF KAMTSCHATKA WERE COLLECTED BY TWO OF THEIR COMPANY DETACHED FOR THAT PURPOSE OF THESE GEORGE WILLIAM STELLER IS MENTIONED BY OUR AUTHOR WITH VERY GREAT RESPECT FOR HIS UNCOMMON ZEAL AND PROFICIENCY143 PROFICIENCY IN NATURAL HISTORY AND FOR HIS OFFERING HIMSELF TO GO UPON AN EXPEDITION WHERE HE MUST FOR A LONG TIME IN VERY UNHOSPITABLE REGIONS NOT ONLY FOREGO ALL THE ACCOMMODATIONS OF HUMAN LIFE BUT BE FREQUENTLY LIABLE TO THE MISERIES ARISING FROM HUNGER COLD AND THE BARBAROUS INHABITANTS OF THESE DAN GERS TO USE OUR AUTHORS OWN WORDS HE WAS CONTEMP TOR STRENUUS AND CONTINUED SEVERAL YEARS UPON THE EX PEDITION SENDING FROM TIME TO TIME TO OUR AUTHOR LARGE COLLECTIONS AND DESCRIPTIONS OF SUCH NATURAL BO DIES AS OCCURRED TO HIM THIS EXCELLENT PERSON TO THE GREAT GRIEF OF OUR AUTHOR AND TO THE IRRETRIEVABLE LOSS OF NATURAL HISTORY DIED ON HIS RETURN HOME AFTER HAVING SURMOUNTED ALMOST INCREDIBLE DIFFICULTIES IN DIGESTING THE PLANTS OF THE WORK BEFORE US INTO CLASSES OUR AUTHOR HAS FOLLOWED THE METHOD OF OUR WORTHY BROTHER PROFESSOR VAN ROYEN OF LEYDEN PUB LISHED IN THE FLORA LEYDENSIS PRODROMUS THIS EXCEL LENT BOTANIST CONSIDERS THAT ALL PLANTS MAY BE RANGED INTO TWENTY CLASSES AND OUR AUTHOR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SYSTEM HAS GIVEN FIVE CLASSES IN HIS FIRST VO LUME VIZ THOSE WHICH VAN ROYEN INTITLES PALMAE LILIA GRAMINA AMENTACEAE AND UMBELLIFERAE AND THREE CLASSES IN THE SECOND VOLUME VIZ COMPOSITAE AGGREGATAE AND TRICOCCAE THE TWELVE REMAINING CLASSES THEREFORE ARE I PRESUME TO BE PUBLISHED HERE AFTER OUR AUTHOR FOLLOWS VAN ROYENS SYSTEM NOT AS HE THINKS IT A PERFECT ONE BUT AS IT NEARLY AP PROACHES TO THE ORDER OF NATURE AND HAS GREAT RELA TION TO OUR COUNTRYMAN MR RAYS METHOD TO WHICH OUR AUTHOR HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED AND DIFFERS FROM IT CHIEFLY INASMUCH AS IT IS MORE COMPLETE SOME AL LOWANCE MUST BE MADE FOR CUSTOM HE DOES NOT 5 DETRACT144 DETRACT FROM THE METHODS OF OTHER AUTHORS MOST OF THEM PLEASE HIM NONE OF THEM ARE WITHOUT THEIR IN CONVENIENCIES AND ALL HAVE THEIR ADVANTAGES THE GREAT POINT IS THAT THE SPECIES SHOULD BE WELL DEFINED AND THAT EACH GENUS SHOULD HAVE ITS ESSENTIAL CHARAC TER OUR AUTHOR HAS GENERALLY ADOPTED THE GENERA OF LINNAEUS SOME INDEED HE HAS TAKEN FROM HALLER BUT WHEREVER HE THOUGHT IT EXPEDIENT TO DIFFER FROM THESE GREAT MEN HE GIVES HIS REASON AND WHEN HE FINDS A PLANT WHICH CANNOT PROPERLY BE RANGED UNDER ANY GENUS ALREADY ESTABLISHED HE FORMS A NEW ONE IN THE EXPLANATION OF WHICH AFTER THE MANNER OF LINNAEUS HE OMITS NOTHING ESSENTIAL THERETO TO THE DIFFERENT SPECIES DISCOVERD IN THIS EXPEDITION P GMELIN HAS AFFIXED NAMES AFTER THE MANNER OF LIN NAEUS HALLER VAN ROYEN AND THE MORE MODERN BOTA NISTS WHICH ARE SUCH AS THAT FROM THE NAME OF THE SPE CIES THE PLANT MAY BE KNOWN BUT IN WHAT RELATES TO THE PLANTS BEFORE DISCOVERD HE ADOPTS THE NAMES GIVEN THEM BY THE BOTANISTS JUST NOW MENTIONED AND SCARCE EVER FORMS A NEW ONE AS HE THINKS A NAME ALREADY RECEIVED THOUGH BUT AN INDIFFERENT ONE SHOULD BE RETAINED IN PREFERENCE PERHAPS TO A BETTER LEST THE NUMBER OF SYNONYMS ALREADY TOO GREAT SHOULD BE AUGMENTED TO THESE HE USUALLY ADDS THE SYNONYMS OF THE BAUHINS AND TOURNEFORT AND SOMETIMES FOR THE SAKE OF THEIR FIGURES THOSE OF MORRISON DODO NAEUS PLUKENET AND LAESELIUS AND LIKEWISE THOSE OF THE RUSSIAN BOTANISTS MESSERSCHMID BAUXBAUM AND AMMAN HE HAS ALSO THROUGHOUT THE WORK CARE FULLY SEPARATED THE VARIETIES OF PLANTS FROM THEIR GE NUINE SPECIES AND HAS LAID DOWN THE PLACES OF THEIR GROWTH THE NAMES GIVEN THEM BY THE INHABITANTS AND145 AND THEIR APPLICATION OF THEM TO THE VARIOUS PURPOSES OF LIFE THE FIGURES OF THE PLANTS WERE TAKEN FROM THE LIFE AND ARE AS FAR AS POSSIBLE REPRESENTED IN THEIR NATURAL PROPORTION BUT FROM THESE MUST BE EX CEPTED THOSE OF GERBER COLLECTED NEAR THE DON AND THE WOLGA AND SOME OTHERS COLLECTED BY DR LERCHE PHYSICIAN TO THE RUSSIAN EMBASSY IN PERSIA NEAR AS TRACAN AND EVEN IN PERSIA THESE WERE DELINEATED FROM DRIED SPECIMENS AND WHEREEVER THE FIGURE DOES NOT TO OUR AUTHORS SATISFACTION REPRESENT THE PLANT INTENDED BY THE NEGLECT OF THE PAINTER OR ENGRAVER HE APPRISES YOU THEREOF AND ENDEAVOURS TO REMEDY THIS DEFECT IN HIS DESCRIPTIONS THE GREAT END OF OUR KNOWLEDGE IN PLANTS SHOULD BE THE INVESTIGATION OF THEIR PROPERTIES AND TO THIS WE ARE FREQUENTLY OBLIGED TO BE LED BY THE APPLICATION OF THEM AMONG THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE PRODUCED IN PERUSING THEREFORE THE FLORA SIBIRICA I HAVE SE LECTED A FEW OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND WHICH I THINK NOT IMPROPER TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY THE VENERAL DISEASE HAS MADE NO INCONSIDERABLE PROGRESS AMONG BARBAROUS AS WELL AS AMONG THE MORE POLITE AND CIVILIZED NATIONS AND OUR AUTHOR HAS GIVEN US TWO METHODS OF TREATING THAT DISTEMPER AMONG THE INHABITANTS OF SIBIRIA FROM WHICH IN SOME DEGREE AN IDEA MAY BE FORMED OF THE STATE OF MEDICINE IN THOSE PARTS OF THE WORLD ONE METHOD IS THEY GIVE THE PATIENT A DECOCTION OF A SPECIES OF CIRSIUM  WHICH   CIRSIUM INERME FOLIIS SCABRIS LANCEOLATIS INFERIORIBUS EX  SINUATO DENTATIS SQUAMIS SUPERIORIBUS CALICUM SUBROTUNDIS MEM  BRANACEIS FLOR SIBIR TOM II PAG 72 T146 WHICH GROWS IN THOSE PARTS AND IS DESCRIBED BY NO BODY BEFORE OUR AUTHOR IN THIS DECOCTION WHEN THE PAINS ARE VIOLENT THEY ADD SOME LEAVES OF A SPECIES OF CHAMAERHODODENDRON WHICH PRODUCES EFFECTS SIMI LAR TO OPIUM BY RELIEVING THE PAIN AND SOMETIMES BRINGING ON A DELIRIUM IF THEY ARE NOT CURED BY THIS DECOCTION WHICH OFTEN HAPPENS IN AN AGGRAVATED STATE OF THE DISEASE THEY THEN BOIL A SMALL QUANTITY OF SUB LIMATE OF MERCURY WITH SOME FAT IN A SPOON OVER A CANDLE MIX IT WITH THE BEFOREMENTIONED DECOCTION AND LET THE PATIENT SWALLOW IT IT IS NO WONDER IF ACCORDING TO OUR AUTHORS RELATION THIS RUDE METHOD SHOULD DESTROY THE PATIENT AND PUT AN END TO HIS LIFE BY SEVERE TORTURE WHICH FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THE OTHER METHOD OF CURE GIVEN US BY OUR AUTHOR IS A MORE REASONABLE ONE AND IS EFFECTED BY ADMINIS TRING A CUPFULL OR TWO OF THE DECOCTION OF A SPECIES OF IRIS  EVERY MORNING DETAINING THE PATIENT IN BED OF THIS THEY GIVE A GREATER OR LESS DOSE IN PROPORTION TO ITS OPERATION WHICH IS BOTH BY VOMIT AND STOOL AFTER HAVING TAKEN IT A WEEK IT CEASES TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF EVACUATING NEVERTHELESS THEY CONTINUE IT AN OTHER WEEK DURING WHICH TIME THE PATIENT IS LAID UPON A HEAP OF FRESH BURDOCKLEAVES AND HIS BODY IS ALSO COVERED WITH THESE LEAVES WHICH MUST BE RE NEWED EVERY DAY THIS METHOD IS SAID TO CURE THE DISEASE RADICALLY RUSSIANS TARTARS AND OTHER NATIONS

WITH MILK OR BROTH AND CONSIDER THEM AS VERY NUTRITIOUS FOOD THIS ROOT CERTAINLY IS IN EVERY RESPECT NEARLY RELATED TO SALEP THE SIBIRIAN HUNTERS WHO KILL VARIOUS ANIMALS FOR THEIR FUR ARE OBLIGED TO GO IN SEARCH OF THEM INTO THE MOST DESART PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND REMAIN THERE DU RING THEIR DREADFUL WINTERS IT HAPPENS OFTEN THAT FROM THE INTENSENESS OF THE COLD THE LEAVEN WHICH FERMENTS THEIR BREAD IS SPOILED AND CEASES TO BE OF USE IN THIS CASE THEY COLLECT THE INNER BARK OF THE LARCH TREE WHICH IS VERY JUICY AND SWEET AND CUT IT INTO SMALL PIECES AND DIGEST IT OVER THE FIRE IN WARM WA TER THEY THEN ADD THERETO SOME RYEFLOUR BURY THE WHOLE IN THE SNOW AND LET IT REMAIN THERE TWELVE HOURS IN WHICH TIME THE FERMENTATION BEGINS AND THE FAECES WHICH FALL TO THE BOTTOM MADE EXCELLENT LEAVEN BOTH THE RUSSIANS AND THE PEOPLE OF KAMTSCHATKA MAKE GREAT USE OF THE  SPHONDYLIUM VULGARE HIRSUTUM OF CASPAR BAUHIN AND TOURNEFORT OR WHAT WE USUALLY CALL COWPARSNEP ACCORDING TO OUR AUTHOR THE PLANT IN QUESTION DIFFERS IN NOTHING FROM THAT SPECIES VERY FREQUENTLY MET WITH IN THE MEADOWS AND PASTURES BOTH OF GERMANY AND ENGLAND BUT IN ITS BEING MUCH LARGER THIS DIFFERENCE OF SIZE THE

A VERY EXACT DESCRIPTION OF IT THIS PLANT WHICH HAS NEVER YET BEEN APPLIED TO ANY USEFUL PURPOSE IN THESE PARTS OF THE WORLD IS OF VERY GREAT IMPORTANCE TO THE RUSSIANS AND PEOPLE OF KAMTSCHATKA THEY INDEED APPLY IT TO VERY DIFFERENT USES THE FORMER DISTIL THEIR BRANDY  FROM IT THE LATTER DRY IT TO EAT IN WINTER AS THESE APPLICATIONS OF THIS PLANT ARE I BELIEVE WHOLLY NEW TO US AND UNOBSERVED BY ANY PRECEDING AUTHOR I SHALL LAY BE FORE YOU A SHORT HISTORY OF THEM ABOUT THE BEGINNING OF JULY THE RADICAL LEAVES ARE ARRIVED AT THEIR GREATEST SIZE AND PERFECTION OF WHICH ONLY THE FOOTSTALKS ARE USED THOUGH AS FAR AS MAY BE JUDGED FROM THE SMELL THE STEM OF THE PLANT IS EQUALLY VALUABLE THESE ARE STRIPPED OF THEIR BARK AND SUSPENDED IN THE SUN IN LITTLE BUNDLES AND AS THEY GROW DRY MANY OF THESE BUNDLES ARE TIED TOGETHER AND EXPOSED AGAIN TO THE SUN UNTIL THEY HAVE PARTED WITH ALL THEIR HUMIDITY THEY ARE AFTERWARDS PUT UP IN BAGS AND IN A VERY SHORT TIME ARE COVERED ALL OVER WITH A YELLOWISH MEALY SACCHARINE EXUDATION OF THE FLAVOUR OF LIQUORICE WHICH IF IT IS WANTED IS SHAKEN OFF AND USED AS SUGAR THE PEOPLE OF KAMT SCHATKA NEVER SEPARATE THIS SUBSTANCE FROM THE STALKS BUT PRESERVE THEM TOGETHER AND EAT THEM THEMSELVES AND REGALE THEIR FRIENDS WITH THEM AS DELICACIES THE  SPIRITUM ARDENTEM149 THE RUSSIANS DRY THEM IN THE SAME MANNER IN ORDER FOR DISTILLATION AND INFUSE THEM IN PROPER PRO PORTIONS WITH WARM WATER TO WHICH THEY ADD THE BERRIES OF THE  MOUNTAIN DWARFCHERRY OR THOSE OF A SPECIES OF VACCINIUM  TO PROMOTE FERMENTATION WHEN THIS IS OVER THEY PUT BOTH THE STALKS AND THE LIQUOR IN WHICH THEY HAVE FERMENTED INTO A STILL AND DRAW OFF THE SPIRIT AS USUAL WHEN THE DISTILLA TION IS OVER THEY DO NOT THROW AWAY THE STALKS UNTIL THEY HAVE PRESSED OUT THEIR JUICY LIQUOR WHICH IS ADDED TO FRESH STALKS TO PROMOTE THEIR FERMENTATION FROM THIS SPIRIT FIRST DRAWN THEY BY DISTILLATION DRAW OFF SOMEWHAT LESS THAN HALF ITS QUANTITY WHICH IS VERY LIKE TO RECTIFIED SPIRIT OF WINE AND MUCH MORE PLEASANT THAN CORNSPIRIT IT MUST BE HERE OBSERVED THAT IF EITHER THE STALKS OR LEAVES OF THIS VALUABLE PLANT ARE APPLIED TO THE SKIN THEY HEAT AND ULCERATE IT THE PEOPLE OF KAMT SCHATKA HOWEVER EAT THE CRUDE STALKS WHEN STRIPPED OF THEIR BARK IN WHICH THEIR ACRIMONY CONSISTS BUT IF THROUGH IGNORANCE THIS BARK IS STRIPPED OFF WITH THEIR TEETH IT INFLAMES AND VESICATES THEIR LIPS AND GUMS WHICH WILL FREQUENTLY CONTINUE A WEEK BEFORE THEY ARE HEALED IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SOME HAVE MADE THE EXPERIMENT OF EXTRACTING A SPIRIT FROM THE STALKS WITHOUT STRIPPING THEM OF THEIR BARK AND THEY HAVE FOUND THAT THEY HAVE FURNISHED AN EQUAL QUAN TITY OF SPIRIT WITH THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN STRIPPED BUT  CHAMAECERASUS MONTANA FRUCTU SINGULARI CAERULEO C B P 451  VACCINIA NIGRA FRUCTU MAJORE PARKINS 1455 VITIS IDAEA MAGNA QUIBUSDAM J B I 518150 BUT IT HAS BEEN OBSERVED THAT THOSE WHO HAVE DRANK OF THIS SPIRIT HAVE SCARCE ESCAPED WITH LIFE AND HAVE COMPLAINED VIOLENTLY OF AN OPPRESSION ABOUT THE PRAE CORDIA A LONG TIME AFTER FROM THE MEALY SUBSTANCE WHICH EXUDES FROM THE STALKS OF THIS PLANT A SPIRIT MAY BE PREPARED PROVIDED THAT THIS SUBSTANCE IS DILUTED IN A PROPER QUANTITY OF WATER AND MADE TO FERMENT BUT THIS IS IN MUCH LESS QUANTITY THAN FROM THE STALKS THEMSELVES THE FERMENTED LIQUOR LIKEWISE THEY USE AS WINE AND FREQUENTLY INTOXICATE THEMSELVES THEREWITH BY WHAT ACCIDENT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THIS PLANT WOULD BY DISTILLATION FURNISH AN INFLAMMABLE SPIRIT AND FOR MANY PARTICULARS RELATING THERETO I MUST REFER YOU TO THE WORK ITSELF AND OUR AUTHOR INFORMS US THAT THE SEVERAL USES OF THIS PLANT WERE COLLECTED WITH GREAT LABOUR BY M KRASKENINIKOFF ONE OF THEIR COMPANY FROM THE COSSACKS OF KAMTSCHATKA DODONAEUS  RELATES THAT THE INHABITANTS OF POLAND AND LITHUANIA MAKE THEMSELVES A KIND OF LIQUOR WHICH THE POOR PEOPLE USE AS BEER FROM THE FER MENTED LEAVES AND SEEDS OF THE SPHONDYLIUM THIS ADDS SOMEWHAT TO THE CREDIBILITY OF THE FORMER RELA TION WHEN STELLER WHOM OUR AUTHOR ALWAYS MENTIONS WITH GREAT ESTEEM WAS AT TOBOLSKI IN THE YEAR 1738 HE WAS INFORMED THAT TWO YEARS BEFORE THEY WERE GRIEVOUSLY AFFLICTED THERE WITH PESTILENTIAL CARBUNCLES WHICH WERE OF SO CONTAGIOUS A NATURE AS TO SEIZE THOSE WHO APPROACHED THE PERSON AFFECTED THE DISEASE FIRST BEGAN IN HORSES AND OXEN AND AFTERWARDS SEIZED  DODON STIRP HISTOR P 304151

THE PART AFFECTED THESE SYMPTOMS WERE ATTENDED WITH A VERY ACUTE FEVER INTIRE LOSS OF STRENGTH VIOLENT PAINS IN THE HEAD AND REDNESS OF THE EYES AN OLD COUNTRY PRACTITIONER FAMOUS IN THESE PARTS FOR HIS JUDGMENT CURED PERSONS LABOURING UNDER THIS SEVERE DISEASE IN A SHORT TIME HE USED FIRST TO THE CARBUN CLE THE POWDER OF AN HERB  OF WHICH IS GIVEN A COMPLETE HISTORY AND FIGURE IN THIS WORK MADE INTO A THIN PULTICE WITH DREGS  OF BEER THIS PULTICE GENTLY WARMED WAS APPLIED TO THE PART AFFECTED AND THE PATIENT CONFINED TO HIS BED WHO WAS AT LIBERTY TO TAKE WHATEVER NOURISHMENT HE LIKED EXCEPT MILK BRANDY OR THE FLESH OF PIKES DURING THIS TIME THE PATIENT DRANK PLENTIFULLY OF A DECOCTION OF THIS HERB COLLECTED DURING THE TIME OF ITS FLOWERING THOUGH THE POWDER APPLIED AS ABOVE WAS PREPARED FROM THE LEAVES BEFORE THE FLOWERSTALK WAS PRODUCED THE CARBUNCLE FROM THIS TREATMENT DID GENERALLY BREAK IN FOURANDTWENTY HOURS AND THE SYMPTOMS GREATLY ABATE THE WOUND WAS SPRINKLED WITH SAL

WHICH THE AUTHOR HAS SHEWN A COMPLETE KNOWLEGE OF THE BOTANIC SCIENCE AMONG THE FIRST PROFESSORS OF WHICH HE IS DESERVEDLY PLACED HE HAS GIVEN US THE DESCRIPTIONS AND FIGURES OF A GREAT NUMBER OF PLANTS HITHERTO NOT DESCRIBED AND IT IS TO BE HOPED THAT HE WILL CONTINUE HIS DILIGENCE IN PUBLISHING THE RE MAINING TWELVE CLASSES BUT HE SHOULD NOT STOP HERE IT WERE TO BE WISHED AS SO MANY SKILFUL PERSONS WERE ENGAGED SO LONG IN THIS DANGEROUS AND EXPENSIVE EXPEDITION THAT THEIR OBSERVATIONS UPON THE REMAINING TWO KINGDOMS OF NATURE SHOULD BE COMMUNICATED TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS A COMPLETE HISTORY OF THEIR TRA VELS INTO THESE UNKNOWN PARTS OF THE WORLD XXII

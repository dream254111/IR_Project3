J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108824,ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS,I207017, 99  VI ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS BY WILLIAM SPOTTISWOODE MA FRS MADE UP OF TWO MEMOIRS ONE RECEIVED NOVEMBER 4 READ NOVEMBER 21 1861 THE OTHER RECEIVED JANUARY 21 READ JANUARY 30 1862 IN A PAPER PUBLISHED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS FOR 1861 P 79 MR W H L RUSSELL HAS CONSTRUCTED SYSTEMS OF MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION FOR FUNCTIONS OF NON COMMUTATIVE SYMBOLS SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAWS OF COMBINATION AS THOSE IN PROFESSOR BOOLES MEMOIR ON A GENERAL METHOD IN ANALYSIS PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1844 IN THIS CALCULUS THERE ARE FOUR SYSTEMS OF MULTIPLICATION AND DIVISION VIZ INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL BOTH 1 WHEN THE FUNCTIONS ARE ARRANGED IN POWERS OF G 2 WHEN IN POWERS OF Z OR AS THEY MAY BE TERMED THE PARRANGEMENT AND THE SARRANGEMENT IN THE PAPER IN QUESTION THE AUTHOR HAS CONFINED HIMSELF SO FAR AS DIVISION IS CONCERNED TO THE CASE MOST USEFUL IN PRACTICE IN WHICH THE DIVISOR IS LINEAR AND OF THIS HE HAS DIS CUSSED IN FULL ONLY THE IARRANGEMENT  1 INTERNAL DIVISION OF THE RARRANGEMENT BY A LINEAR FACTOR ADOPTING THE SAME NOTATION AS MR RUSSELL I PROPOSE

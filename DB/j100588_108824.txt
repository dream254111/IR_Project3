received November 4 Read November 21 1861 the other received January 21 read January 30 1862 IN a paper published in the Philosophical Transactions for 1861 p 79 Mr W H L RUSSELL has constructed systems of multiplication and division for functions of non commutative symbols subject to the same laws of combination as those in Professor BOOLES memoir On a General Method in Analysis Philosophical Transactions 1844 In this calculus there are four systems of multiplication and division viz internal and external both 1 when the functions are arranged in powers of g 2 when in powers of z or as they may be termed the parrangement and the sarrangement In the paper in question the author has confined himself so far as division is concerned to the case most useful in practice in which the divisor is linear And of this he has dis cussed in full only the iarrangement  1 Internal division of the rarrangement by a linear factor Adopting the same notation as Mr RUSSELL I propose here to investigate in the first place the condition that mlr4bo may be an internal factor of p   p   op and to determine the quotient This is partially discussed in pp 7375 Let  then performing the actual divisions for brevity writing 4 for 4g and p for g 7Tr40o Io O Hence the condition that mf4o0 may be an internal factor of ifr0f will be Popi 0 1 o 2MR W SPOTTISWOODE ON THE CALCULUS OF SYMBOLS

remainder iarising from the division of P3gX3 by the factor in question hence we have now only to divide the term p3fn by AlgX40g and add the remainder so found to 2 in order to have the condition required for the third degree Proceeding to the division writing X  andomitting for the present P3 which since the division is internal can be replaced as an external factor in the remainder we have

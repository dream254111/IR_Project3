and black Himalaya bears are found only in the mountains of northern India The third kind Ursus labiatus is found only on the plains or in the lower moun tainpasses as in the Neilgherries of Madras This last is not a flesh eater but lives principally on wild fruit various roots grain ants and honey The two mountain bears on the contrary are un doubtedly beasts of prey and kill and consume as opportunity offers sheep goats and cows a large number of cases occurring every year Woodmen are often brought home frightfully torn and mangled and at times cases are reported when a bear has attacked a man without the least provo cation A shebear wlth young is more eager than any other animal to keep men from the neighborhood of her young she will furiously at tack any one who approaches them and will pur sue him and wound him seriously with her teeth and claws but a case has never been heard of although often mentioned in books where she en gaged in close combat and attempted to crush her victim in her strong embrace Indian bears are especially night animals but they are frequently met with in the daytime especially during the rainy season when the grass and jungles are thick and overgrown At these times and in distant places where the forests are little travelled one may easily come across the black bear seeking acorns under clusters of oaks or bending down boughs to obtain the fruit and it is not at all rare to see a bear trotting toward one in the open high way But if he is only left alone as a rule he will seldom trouble a man To complete the record another fourfooted animal must be mentioned namely the bheria or Indian wolf to which many men and animals fall victims There is something especially abomin able in his character for he scarcely ever ventures on a man or woman but makes children his prey In some of the northern provinces of India es pecially in Oude and in some parts of Rohilcund and also in the whole northwestern province of Bengal the loss of human life by the wolf is very great While the larger catlike animals as the tiger lion panther and leopard are night animals the wolf belonging to the dog tribe is a day robber At night he carries off little children from their beds or from the side of their parents if they sleep in the open air The natives state that if a wolf has once tasted human flesh he afterwards specially desires it and touches almost no other food A wolf usually lies in ambush in the immediate neighborhood of a village in a corn 347 field or in a strip of sugarcane and here bides his time and watches a company of naked chil dren at play until by chance one of them gets separated a little from his playmates and ap proaches the wolf Then a sudden shriek is heard and a brown object is seen fleeing in all haste very rarely can such a child be saved for the wolf generally strangles it long before help can be rendered According to the natives the Indian wolf is so sly and cautious that he is never caught either in ditches or in traps AN AFRICAN SMITtHY IN his account in the London Graphic of his journey to Kilimanjaro Mr H H Johnston de scribes a native forge The MaChaga are clever smiths and forge all kinds of utensils weapons and ornaments from the pigiron they receive from the country of Usanga AN AFRICAN FORGE near Lake Jipe The forge is but a pair of goat skin bellows converging into a hollow cone of wood to which are added two more segments of stone pierced through the centre and ending in a stone nozzle which is thrust into the furnace of charcoal The bellows are kept steady by several OCTOBER 16 1885348 S rCII pegs thrust into the ground and a huge stone is often placed on the pipe to keep it firn After the iron has been heated white hot in the charcoal it is taken out by the iron pincers and beaten on a stone anvil The Chaga smiths not only make spear blades and knives of apparently tempered steel but can fabricate the finest and most delicate chains THE INDUSTRIES OF SIBERIA1 IN the region of the Amoor the industries are of very small extent chiefly on account of lack of means of transportation The only possible com lnunication at present is upon the rivers and is completely closed during a great part of the year when the rivers are impassable for both boats and sledges This is unfortunate for on the borders of this immense territory lie important industrial interests At the sources of the tributaries of the Amoor are gold mines Kamchatka and the neighbor ing islands produce valuable furs the island of Saghalin has rich and excellent coal deposits Moreover in the southern part in the socalled Usuri region are rich timberlands and some land even capable of cultivation The pursuit of these industries with the fisheries and coalmines would make this Usuri region a valuable source of revenue at present however they are very slightly developed and that mostly by Americans and Chinese rather than by Russians The latter however are making strenuous exertions to colo nize the territory and thus avail themselves of its resources The industries of the two western provinces Tobolsk and Tomsk are somewhat farther ad vanced these two provinces contain over 80 per cent of all the manufactories of Siberia Accord ing to the official reports there are 2300 of these of which 1460 are in Tobolsk and 660 in Tomsk In all 12500 hands are employed and 14000000 roubles value produced annually The most im portant class of manufactures is that which uses raw animal materialsdyeing and tallow render ing establishments etc The class next in impor tance includes the distilleries breweries and flour mills Besides these there are numerous soap candle and glue factories carriage factories rope walks felt  boot making establishments etc These latter can scarcely be called factories but are rather of the nature of small workshops Except the mines and the smelting works closely connected with them thereis very little manu facture of mineral products in Siberia There is one exception in the case of considerable glass works which produce 200000 roubles worth annu lCondensed from an article in the Oesterreichische monat schrift fur den Orient N7CJET VOL VI No 141 ally There are also small potteries and brick kilns The only textile manufacturing worthy of notice is done at a single establishment in Tjumen which produces annually 200000 roubles worth of army cloth The needs of the people in this line are almost entirely supplied by household manu factures Many knit and woven woollen articles prepared in this way find a market even in European Russia In all the Siberian manufactures there is almost no national division of labor or management of capital The same person is often both capitalist and laborer and the production of the raw ma terials goes hand in hand with the manufactures The manufactories are distributed here and there about the country where the raw material is to be had to the best advantage for transportation is difficult and costly Many products even those which have a wide demand produce a bad impression on account of their clumsiness and tasteless execution The low standard of living and education among the peas ants who are the principal customers is the main cause of this For instance in a town of Tobolsk are produced coarse clumsy muskets with flint locks which nevertheless find a ready sale at a good price even as far as East Siberia and A moor In general however manufacturing has taken many steps in advance in Siberia within the last fifteen years In many places machinery has taken the place of hand labor better processes in tanning dyeing etc have been introduced and a general improvement is noticeable in the quality of all the the productions With better means of transpor tation and an infusion of European enterprise Siberia will yet contribute an important share to the resources of the world  According to the Indian papers Dr Aitchi son has made an extensive botanical collection in Badghis and Khorassan in Persia and when last heard of was at Turbat on the PersoAfghan fron tier He is said to be very anxious to transfer his collections which number 600 species to Kew His researches have been directed not merely to the collection of plants but to ascertaining the uses to which they are put locally  The rapidity with which stalactites are formed under favorable condition is well shown in St Johns Gate Quebec This old gate in the walls of the city was rebuilt in 1867 of a greyish limestone and the constant dripping of water from the crevices has made deposits of rather dirty limey matter In many cases regular stalactites have been formed some reaching a length of a foot and a half and being at least threequarters of an inch in diameter at the base

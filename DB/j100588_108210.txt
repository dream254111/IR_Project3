ELECTROLYTIC FLUID III ACTIVE CIRCLES EXCITED BY SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 8FC  24 ON THE SOURCE OF POWER IN THE VOLTAIC PILE 1796 WHAT IS THE SOURCE OF POWER IN A VOLTAIC PILE THIS QUESTION IS AT PRESENT OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE IN THE THEORY AND TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRICAL SCIENCE THE OPINIONS HELD RESPECTING IT ARE VARIOUS BUT BY FAR THE MOST IMPORTANT ALE THE TWO WHICH RESPECTIVELY FIND THTE SOURCE OF POWER IN CONTACT AND IN CHEMICAL FORCE THE QUESTION BETWEEN THEM TOUCHES THE FIRST PRINCIPLES OF ELECTRICAL ACTION FOR THE OPINIONS ARE IN SUCH CONTRAST THAT TWO MEN RESPECTIVELY ADOPTING THEM ARE THENCE FORWARD CONSTRAINED TO DIFFER IN EVERY POINT RESPECTING THE PROBABLE AND INTIMATE NATURE OF THE AGENT OR FORCE ON WHICH ALL THE PHENOMENA OF THE VOLTAIC PILE DEPEND 1797 THE THEORY OF CONTACT IS THE THEORY OF VOLTA THE GREAT DISCOVERER OF THE VOLTAIC PILE ITSELF AND IT HAS BEEN SUSTAINED SINCE HIS DAY BY A HOST OF PHILOSOPHERS AMONGST WHOM IN RECENT TINMES

SERIES XVI EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE IN PROOF THAT CHEMICAL ACTION ALWAYS EVOLVES ELECTRICITY AND DE LA RIVE SHOULD BE NAMED AS MOST CLEAR AND CONSTANT IN HIS VIEWS AND MOST ZEALOUS IN HIS PRODUCTION OF FACTS AND ARGUMENTS FROM THE YEAR 1827 TO THE PRESENT TIMET 1798 EXAMINING THIS QUESTION BY THE RESULTS OF DEFINITE ELECTROCHEMICAL ACTION I FELT CONSTRAINED TO TAKE PART WITH THOSE WHO BELIEVED THE ORIGIN OF VOLTAIC POWER TO CONSIST IN CHEMICAL ACTION ALONE 875 965 AND VENTURED A PAPER ON IT IN APRIL 1834 875 C WHICH OBTAINED THE ESPECIAL NOTICE OF MARIANINI THE RANK OF THIS PHILOSOPHER THE OBSERVATION OF FECHNERII AND THE CONSCIOUSNESS THAT OVER THE GREATER PART OF ITALY AND GERMANY THE CONTACT THEORY STILL PREVAILED HAVE INDUCED ME TO REEXAMINE THE QUESTION MOST CAREFULLY I WISHED NOT MERELY TO ESCAPE FROM ERROR BUT WAS ANXIOUS TO CONVINCE MYSELF OF THE TRUTH OF THE CONTACT THEORY FOR IT WAS EVIDENT THAT IF CONTACT ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE HAD ANY EXISTENCE IT MUST BE A POWER NOT MERELY UNLIKE EVERY OTHER NATURAL POWER AS TO THE PHENOMENA IT COULD PRODUCE BUT ALSO IN THE FAR HIGHER POINTS OF LIMITATION DEFINITE FORCE AND FINITE PRODUCTION 2065 1799 I VENTURE TO HOPE THAT THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS AND ARGUMENTS WHICH HAVE BEEN THUS GATHERED MAY BE USEFUL TO SCIENCE I FEAR THE DETAIL WILL BE TEDIOUS BUT THAT IS A NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE STATE OF THE SUBJECT THE CONTACT THEORY HAS LONG HAD POSSESSION OF MENS MINDS IS SUSTAINED BY A GREAT WEIGHT OF AUTHORITY AND FOR YEARS HAD ALMOST UNDISPUTED SWAY IN SOME PARTS OF EUROPE IF IT BE AN ERROR IT CAN ONLY BE ROOTED OUT BY A GREAT AMOUNT OF FORCIBLE EXPERIMENTAL EVIDENCE A FACT SUFFICIENTLY CLEAR TO MY MIND BY THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT DE LA RIVES PAPERS HAVE NOT ALREADY CONVINCED THE WORKERS UPON THIS SUBJECT HENCE THE REASON WHY I HAVE THOUGHT IT NEEDFUL TO ADD MY FURTHER TESTIMONY TO HIS AND THAT OF OTHERS ENTERING INTO DETAIL AND MULTIPLYING FACTS IN A PROPORTION FAR BEYOND ANY WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN REQUIRED FOR THE PROOF AND PROMULGATION OF A NEW SCIENTIFIC TRUTH 2017 IN SO DOING I MAY OCCASIONALLY BE ONLY ENLARGING YET THEN I HOPE STRENGTHENING WHAT OTHERS AND ESPECIALLY DE LA RIVE HAVE DONE 1800 IT WILL TEND TO CLEAR THE QUESTION IF THE VARIOUS VIEWS OF CONTACT ARE FIRST STATED VOLTAS THEORY IS THAT THE SIMPLE CONTACT OF CONDUCTING BODIES CAUSES ELEC TRICITY TO BE DEVELOPED AT THE POINT OF CONTACT WITHOUT ANY CHANGE IN NATURE OF THE BODIES THEMSELVES AND THAT THOUGH SUCH CONDUCTORS AS WATER AND AQUEOUS FLUIDS  AD 1824 C ANNALES DE CHIMIE 1824 XXV 405 1827 XXXV 113 1831 XLVI 265 276 337 XLVII

MEVARIOUS VIEWS OF CONTACT AND CHEMICAL EXCITEMENT HAVE THIS PROPERTY YET THE DEGREE IN WHICH THEY POSSESS IT IS UNWORTHY OF CONSIDERA TION IN COMPARISON WITH THE DEGREE TO WHICH IT RISES AMONGST THE METALS THE PRESENT VIEWS OF THE ITALIAN AND GERMNAN CONTACT PHILOSOPHERS ARE I BELIEVE GENERALLY THE SAME EXCEPT THAT OCCASIONALLY MORE IMPORTANCE IS ATTACHED TO THE CONTACT OF THE IM PERFECT CONDUCTORS WITH THE METALS THUS ZAMBONI IN 1837 CONSIDERS THE METALLIC CONTACT AS THE MOST POWERFUL SOURCE OF ELECTRICITY AND NOT THAT OF THE METALS WITH THE FLUIDST BUT KARSTEN HOLDING THE CONTACT THEORY TRANSFERS THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE TO THE CONTACT OF THE FLUIDS WITH THE SOLID CONDUCTORS MARIANINI HOLDS THE SAME VIEW OF THE PRINCIPLE OF CONTACT WITH THIS ADDITION THAT ACTUAL CONTACT IS NOT REQUIRED TO THE EXERTION OF THE EXCITING FORCE BUT THAT THE TWO APPROXIMATED DISSI MILAR CONDUCTORS MAY AFFECT EACH OTHERS STATE WHEN SEPARATED BY SENSIBLE INTERVALS OF THE ODTH OF A LINE AND MORE AIR INTERVENING I801 DE LA RIVE ON THE CONTRARY CONTENDS FOR SIMPLE AND STRICT CHEMICAL ACTION AND AS FAR AS I AM AWARE ADMNITS OF NO CURRENT IN THE VOLTAIC PILE THAT IS NOT CONJOINED WITH AND DEPENDENT UPON A COMPLETE CHEMICAL EFFECT THAT ADMIRABLE ELECTRICIAN BECQUEREL THOUGH EXPRESSING HIMSELF WITH GREAT CAUTION SEEMS TO ADMIT THE POSSI BILITY OF CHEMNICAL ATTRACTIONS BEING ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICAL CURRENTS WHEN THEY ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THE FORCE OF COHESION AND SO TERMINATE IN COMNBINA TION 11 SCHENBEIN STATES THAT A CURRENT MAY BE PRODUCED BY A TENDENCY TO CHEMICAL ACTION I E THAT SUBSTANCES WHICH HAVE A TENDENCY TO UNITE CHEMICALLY MAY PRODUCE A CURRENT THOUGH THAT TENDENCY IS NOT FOLLOWED UP BY THE ACTUAL COMBINATION OF THE SUBSTANCEST IN THESE CASES THE ASSIGNED FORCE BECOMES THE SAMNE AS THE CONTACT OF VOLTA INASDMUCH AS THE ACTING MATTERS ARE NOT ALTERED WHILST PRODUCING THE CURRENT DAVYS OPINION WAS THAT CONTACT LIKE THAT OF VOLTA EXCITED THE CURRENT OR WAS THE CAUSE OF IT BUT THAT CHEMICAL CHANGES SUPPLIED THE CURRENT FOR MYSELF I AM AT PRE SENT OF THE OPINION WHICH DE LA RIVE HOLDS AND DO NOT THINK THAT IN THE VOLTAIC PILE MERE CONTACT DOES ANYTHING IN THE EXCITATION OF THE CURRENT EXCEPT AS IT IS PRE PARATORY TO AND ENDS IN COMPLETE CHEMICAL ACTION 1741 1745 1802 THUS THE VIEWS OF CONTACT VARY AND IT NMAY BE SAID THAT THEY PASS GRADUALLY FROM ONE TO ANOTHER EVEN TO THE EXTENT OF INCLUDING CHEMICAL ACTION BUT THE TWO EXTREMES APPEAR TO ME IRRECONCILABLE IN PRINCIPLE UNDER ANY SHAPE THEY ARE AS FOL LOWS THE CONTACT THEORY ASSTUMES THAT WHEN TWO DIFFEIENT BODIES BEING CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY ARE IN CONTACT THERE IS A FORCE AT THE POINT OF CONTACT BY WHICHL ONE OF THE BODIES GIVES A PART OF ITS NATURAL PORTION OF ELECTRICITY TO THE OTHER BODY WHICH THE LATTER TAKES IN ADDITION TO ITS OWN NATURAL PORTION THAT THOUGH THE TOUCHING POINTS HAVE THUS RESPECTIVELY GIVEN AND TAKEN ELECTRICITY THEY CANNOT RETAIN THE

THEM TO KEEP THAT STATE 2069 THAT ALL THIS HAPPENS WITHOUT ANY PERMANENT ALTERATION OF THE PARTS THAT ARE IN CONTACT AND HAS NO REFERENCE TO THEIR CHEMICAL FORCES 2065 2069 1803 THE CHEMICAL THEORY ASSUMES THAT AT THE PLACE OF ACTION THE PARTICLES WHICH ARE IN CONTACT ACT CHEMICALLY UPON EACH OTHER AND ARE ABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES TO THROW MORE OR LESS OF THE ACTING FORCE INTO A DYNAMIC FORM 947 996 1120 THAT IN THE MOST FAVOURABLE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WHOLE IS CONVERTED INTO DYNAMIC FORCE 1000 THAT THEN THE AMOUNT OF CURRENT FORCE PRODUCED IS AN EXACT EQUIVALENT OF THE ORIGINAL CHEMICAL FORCE EMPLOYED AND THAT IN NO CASE IN THE VOLTAIC PILE CAN ANY ELECTRIC CURRENT BE PRODUCED WITHOUT THE ACTIVE EXERTION AND CONSUMPTION OF AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF CHEMICAL FORCE ENDING IN A GIVEN AMAOUNT OF CHEMICAL CHANGE 1804 MARIANINIS PAPER WAS TO ME A GREAT MOTIVE FOR REEXAMINING THE SUBJECT LUT THE COURSE I HAVE TAKEN WAS NOT SO MUCH FOR THE PURPOSE OF ANSWERING PARTICULAR OBJECTIONS AS FOR THE PROCURING EVIDENCE WHETHER RELATING TO CONTROVERTED POINTS OR NOT WHICH SHOULD BE SATISFACTORY TO MY OWN MIND OPEN TO RECEIVE EITHER ONE THEORY OR THE OTHER THIS PAPER THEREFORE IS NOT CONTROVERSIAL BUT CONTAINS FURTHER FACTS AND PROOFS OF THE TRUTH OF DE LA RIVES VIEWS THE CASES MARIANINI PUTS ARE OF EX TREME INTEREST AND ALL HIS OBJECTIONS MUST ONE DAY BE ANSWERED WHEN NUMERICAL RESULTS BOTH AS TO INTENSITY AND QUANTITY OF FORCE ARE OBTAINED BUT THEY ARE ALL DE IATEABLE AND TO MY MIND DEPEND UPON VARIATIONS OF QUANTITY WHICH DO NOT AFFECT SERIOUSLY THE GENERAL QUESTION THUS WHEN THAT PHILOSOPHER QUOTES THE NUMERICAL R ESULTS OBTAINED BY CONSIDERING TWO METALS WITH FLUIDS AT THEIR OPPOSITE EXTREMITIES WHICH TEND TO FORM COUNTER CURRENTS THE DIFFERENCE W OIH HE PUTS DOWN TO THE EFFECT OF METALLIC CONTACT EITHER MADE OR INTERRUPTED I THINK ACCOUNTABLE FOR ON THE FACTS PARTLY KNOWN RESPECTING OPPOSED CURRENTS AND WITH ME DIFFERENCES QUITE AS GREAT AND GREATER HAVE ARISEN AND ARE GIVEN IN FORMER PAPERS 1046 WHEN METALLIC CONTACTS WERE IN THE CIRCUIT SO AT PAGE 213 OF HIS MEMOIR I CANNOT ADMIT THAT E SHOULD GIVE AN EFFECT EQUAL TO THLE DIFFERENCE OF B AND D FOR IN B AND D THE OPPOSITION PRESENTED TO THE EXCITED CURRENTS IS MERELY THAT OF A BAD CONDUCTOR BUT IN THE CASE OF E THE OPPOSITION ARISES FROM THE POWER OF AN OPPOSED ACTING SOURCE OF A CURRENT 1805 AS TO THE PART OF HIS MEMOIR RESPECTING THE ACTION OF SULPHURETTED SOLUTIONST I HOPE TO BE ALLOWED TO REFER TO THE INVESTIGATIONS RMADE FURTHER ON I DO NOT FIND AS THE ITALIAN PHILOSOPHER THAT IRON WITH GOLD OR PLATINA IN SOLUTION OF THE SULPHURET OF POTASSA IS POSITIVE TO THEM I BUT ON THE CONTRARY POWERFULLY NEGATIVE AND FOR REASONS GIVEN IN THE SEQUEL 2049 1806 WITH RESPECT TO THE DISCUSSION OF THE CAUSE

NOT THEREFORE DO MORE AT PRESENT THAN WITHDRAW MY OWN OBSERVATIONS 1807 I NOW PROCEED TO ADDRESS MYSELF TO THE GENERAL ARGUMENT RATHER THAN TO PARTICULAR CONTROVERSY OR TO THE DISCUSSION OF CASES FEEBLE IN POWER AND DOUBTFUL IN NATURE FOR I HAVE BEEN IMPRESSED FROM THE FIRST WITH THE FEELING THAT IT IS NO WEAK INFLUENCE OR FEEBLE PHENOMENON THAT WE HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR BUT SUCH AS INDICATES A FORCE OF EXTREME POWER REQUIRING THEREFORE THAT THE CAUSE ASSIGNED SHOULD BEAR SOME PROPORTION BOTH IN INTENSITY AND QUANTITY TO THE EFFECTS PRODUCED 1808 THE INVESTIGATIONS HAVE ALL BEEN MADE BY AID OF CURRENTS AND THE GALVANO METER FOR IT SEEMED THAT SUCH AN INSTRUMENT AND SUCH A COURSE WERE BEST SUITED TO AN EXAMINATION OF THE ELECTRICITY OF THE VOLTAIC PILE THE ELECTROMETER IS NO DOUBT A MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUMENT BUT THE PHILOSOPHERS WHO DO USE IT ARE NOT OF ACCORD IN RESPECT TO THE SAFETY AND DELICACY OF ITS RESULTS AND EVEN IF THE FEW INDICATIONS AS YET GIVEN BY THE ELECTROMETER BE ACCEPTED AS CORRECT THEY ARE FAR TOO GENERAL TO SETTLE THE QUESTION OF WHETHER CONTACT OR CHEMICAL ACTION IS THE EXCITING FORCE IN THE VOLTAIC BATTERY TO APPLY THAT INSTRUMENT CLOSELY AND RENDER IT OF ANY FORCE IN SUPPLYING AFFIRMATIVE ARGUMENTS TO EITHER THEORY IT WOULD BE NECESSARY TO CONSTRUCT A TABLE OF CONTACTS OR THE EFFECTS OF CONTACTS OF THE DIFFERENT METALS AND FLUIDS CON CERNED IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE VOLTAIC PILE TAKEN IN PAIRS 1868 EXPRESSING IN SUCH TABLE BOTH THE DIRECTION AND THE AMOUNT OF THE CONTACT FORCE 1809 IT IS ASSUMED BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THE CONTACT THEORY THAT THOUGH THE ME ALS EXERT STRONG ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES AT THEIR POINTS OF CONTACT WITH EACH OTHER YET THESE ARE SO BALANCED IN A METALLIC CIRCUIT THAT NO CURRENT IS EVER PRODUCED WHATEVER THEIR ARRANGEMENT MAY BE SO IN PLATE III FIG 1 IF THE CONTACT FORCE OF COPPER AND ZINC IS 10  AND A THIRD METAL BE INTRODUCED AT M THE EFFECT OF ITS CONTACTS WHATEVER THAT METAL MAY BE WITH THE ZINC AND COPPER AT B AND C WILL BE AN AMOUNT OF FORCE IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION    10 THUS IF IT WERE POTASSIUM ITS CONTACT FORCE AT B MIGHT BE 5  BUT THEN ITS CONTACT FORCE AT C WOULD BE  15 OR IF IT WERE GOLD ITS CONTACT FORCE AT B MIGHT BE  19 BUT THEN ITS CONTACT FORCE AT C WOULD BE 9 THIS IS A VERY LARGE ASSUMPTION AND THAT THE THEORY MAY AGREE WITH THE FACTS IS NECESSARY STILL IT IS I BELIEVE ONLY AN ASSUMPTION FOR I AM NOT AWARE OF ANY DATA INDEPENDENT OF THE THEORY IN QUESTION WHICH PROVE ITS TRUTH 1810 ON THE OTHER HAND IT IS ASSUMED THAT FLUID CONDUCTORS AND SUCH BODIES AS CONTAIN WATER OR IN A WORD THOSE WHICH I HAVE CALLED ELECTROLYTES 664 823 921 EITHER EXERT NO CONTACT FORCE AT THEIR PLACE OF CONTACT WITH THE METALS OR IF THEY DO EXERT SUCH A POWER THEN IT IS WITH THIS MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE THAT THE FORCES ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE SAME LAW OF COMPENSATION OR NEUTRALIZATION IN THE COMPLETE CIRCUIT AS HOLDS WITH THE METALS 1809 BUT THIS I THINK I AM JUSTIFIED IN SAYING IS AN AS  PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE 1838 XIII 401 65 MDCCCXL K66 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI SUMPTION ALSO FOR IT IS SUPPORTED NOT BY ANY INDEPENDENT MEASUREMENT OR FACTS 1808 BUT ONLY BY THE THEORY WHICH IT IS ITSELF INTENDED TO SUPPORT 1811 GUIDED BY THIS OPINION AND WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAIN WHAT IS IN AN AC TIVE CIRCLE EFFECTED BY CONTACT AND WHAT BY CHETNICAL ACTION I ENDEAVOURED TO FIND SONILE BODIES IN THIS LATTER CLASS 1810 WHICH SHOULD BE WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION ON THE METALS EMPLOYED SO AS TO EXCLUDE THAT CAUSE OF A CURRENT AND YET SUCH GOOD CON DUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY AS TO SHOW ANY CURRENTS DUE TO THE CONTACT OF THESE METALS WITH EACH OTHER OR WITH THE FLUID CONCLUDING THAT ANY ELECTROLYTE WHICH WOULD CONDUCT THE THERMO CURRENT OF A SINGLE PAIR OF BISMUTH AND ANTIMONY PLATES WOULD SERVE THE REQUIRED PURPOSE I SOUGHT FOR SUCH AND FORTUNATELY SOON FOUND THEM T I EXCITING ELECTROLYTES SC BEING CONDUCTORS OF THERMO ANDFEEBLE CURRENTS 1812 SULPHURET OF POTASSIUMTHIS SUBSTANCE AND ITS SOLUTION WERE PREPARED AS FOLLOWS EQUAL WEIGHTS OF CAUSTIC POTASH POTASSA FUSA AND SULPHUR WERE MIXED AND HEATED GRADUALLY IN A FLORENCE FLASK TILL THE WHOLE HAD FUZED AND UNITED AND THE SULPHUR IN EXCESS BEGAN TO SUBLIME IT WAS THEN COOLED AND DISSOLVED IN WATER SO AS TO FORMN A STRONG SOLUTION WHICH BY STANDING BECAME QUITE CLEAR 1813 A PORTION OF THIS SOLUTION WAS INCLUDED IN A CIRCUIT CONTAINING A GALVANO METER AND A PAIR OF ANTIMONY AND BISMUTH PLATES THE CONNEXION WITH THE ELECTROLYTE WAS MADE BY TWO PLATINUM PLATES EACH ABOUT TWO INCHES LONG AND HALF AN INCH WIDE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF EACH WAS IMMERSED AND THEY WERE ABOUT HALF AN INCH APART WHEN THE CIRCUIT WAS COMPLETED AND ALL AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE THERE WAS NO CUR RENT BUT THE MOMENT THE JUNCTION OF THE ANTIMONY AND BISMUTH WAS EITHER HEATED OR COOLED THE CORRESPONDING THERMO CURRENT WAS PRODUCED CAUSING THE GALVANOMETER NEEDLE TO BE PERMANENTLY DEFLECTED OCCASIONALLY AS MUCH AS 80 EVEN THE SMALL DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE OCCASIONED BY TOUCHING THE SEEBECK ELEMENT WITH THE FINGER PRODUCED A VERY SENSIBLE CURRENT THROUGH THE ELECTROLYTE WHEN IN PLACE OF THE ANTIMONYBISMUTH COMBINATION MERE WIRES OF COPPER AND PLATINUM OR IRON AND PLA TINUM WERE USED THE APPLICATION OF THE SPIRITLAMP TO THE JUNCTION OF THESE METALS PRODUCED A THERMO CURRENT WHICH INSTANTLY TRAVELLED ROUND THE CIRCUIT 1814 THUS THIS ELECTROLYTE WILL AS TO HIGH CONDUCTING POWER FULLY ANSWER THE CONDITION REQUIRED 1811 IT IS SO EXCELLENT IN THIS RESPECT THAT I WAS ABLE TO SEND THE THERMO CURRENT OF A SINGLE SEEBECKS ELEMENT ACROSS FIVE SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS CON NECTED WITH EACH OTHER BY PLATINUM PLATES 1815 NITROUS ACIDYELLOW ANHYDROUS NITROUS ACID MADE BY DISTILLING DRY NITRATE OF LEAD BEING PUT INTO A GLASS TUBE AND INCLUDED IN A CIRCUIT WITH THE ANTIMONY BISMUTH ARRANGEMENT AND THE GALVANOMETER GAVE NO INDICATION OF THE PASSAGE OF THE THERMO CURRENT THOUGH THE IMMERSED ELECTRODES CONSISTED EACH OF ABOUT FOUR INCHES IN LENGTH OF MODERATELY THICK PLATINUM WIRE AND WERE NOT ABOVE A QUARTER OF AN INCH APART 1816 A PORTION OF THIS ACID WAS MIXED WITH NEARLY ITS VOLUME OF PURE WATER THEELECTROLYTES BEING EXCELLENT CONDUCTORS RESULTING ACTION CAUSED DEPRESSION OF TEMPERATURE THE EVOLUTION OF SOME NITROUS GAS THE FORMATION OF SOME NITRIC ACID AND A DARK GREEN FLUID WAS PRODUCED THIS WAS NOW SUCH AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY THAT ALMOST THE FEEBLEST CURRENT COULD PASS IT THAT PRODUCED BY SEEBECKS CIRCLE WAS SENSIBLE WHEN ONLY ONE EIGHTH OF AN INCH IN LENGTH OF THE PLATINUM WIRES DIPPED IN THE ACID WHEN A COUPLE OF INCHES OF EACH ELECTRODE WAS IN THE FLUID THE CONDUCTION WAS SO GOOD THAT IT MADE VERY LITTLE DIF FERENCE AT THE GALVANOMETER WHETHER THE PLATINUNM WIRES TOUCHED EACH OTHER IN THE FLUID OR WERE A QUARTER OF AN INCH APART  1817 NITRIC ACIDSOME PURE NITRIC ACID WAS BOILED TO DRIVE OFF ALL THE NITROUS ACID AND THEN COOLED BEING INCLUDED IN THE CIRCUIT BY PLATINUM PLATES 1813 IT WAS FOUND TO CONDUCT SO BADLY THAT THE EFFECT OF THE ANTIMONYBISMUTH PAIR WHEN THE DIF FERENCE OF TEMPERATURE WAS AT THE GREATEST WAS SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE AT THE GALVANO METER 1818 ON USING A PALE YELLOW ACID OTHERWISE PURE IT WAS FOUND TO POSSESS RATHER MORE CONDUCTING POWER THAN THE FORMER ON EMPLOYING A RED NITRIC ACID IT WAS FOUND TO CONDUCT THE THERMOCURRENT VERY WELL ON ADDING SOME OF THE GREEN NI TROUS ACID 1816 TO THE COLOURLESS NITRIC ACID THE MIXTURE ACQUIRED HIGH CONDUCTING POWERS HENCE IT IS EVIDENT THAT NITRIC ACID IS NOT A GOOD CONDUCTOR WHEN PURE BUT THAT THE PRESENCE OF NITROUS ACID IN IT CONJOINTLY PROBABLY WITH WATER GIVES IT THIS POWER IN A VERY HIGH DEGREE AMONGST ELECTROLYTEST A VERY RED STRONG NITRIC ACID AND A WEAK GREEN ACID CONSISTING OF ONE VOL STRONG NITRIC ACID AND TWO VOLS OF WATER WHICTH HAD BEEN RENDERED GREEN BY THE ACTION OF THE NEGATIVE PLATINUM ELECTRODE OF A VOLTAIC BATTERY WERE BOTH SUCH EXCELLENT CONDUCTORS THAT THE THERMO CURRENT COULD PASS ACROSS FIVE SEPARATE PORTIONS OF THEM CONNECTED BY PLATINUM PLATES WITH SO LITTLE RETARDATION THAT I BELIEVE TWENTY INTERRUPTIONS WOULD NOT HAVE STOPPED THIS FEEBLE CURRENT 1819 SULPHURIC ACIDSTRONG OIL OF VITRIOL WHEN BETWEEN PLATINUM ELECTRODES 1813 CONDUCTED THE ANTIMAONYBISMUTH THERMO CURRENT SENSIBLY BUT FEEBLY A MIXTURE OF TWO VOLUMES

OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1813 AND THE NITROUS ACID 1816 FOR THE GREAT AMOUNT OF THIS POWER THE PEROXIDE OF MANGANESE AND LEAD ARE STILL MORE REMARKABLE FOR POSSESSING THIS POWER BECAUSE THE PROTOXIDES OF THESE METALS DO NOT CONDUCT EITHER THE FEEBLE THERINO CURRENT OR A FAR MORE POWERFUL ONE FROM A VOLTAIC BATTERY THIS CIRCUMSTANCE MADE ME ESPECIALLY ANXIOUS TO VERIFY THE POINT WITH THE PEROXIDE OF LEAD I THEREFORE PREPARED SOME FROM REDLEAD BY THE ACTION OF SUCCESSIVE PORTIONS OF NITRIC ACID THEN BOILED THE BROWN OXIDE SO OBTAINED IN SEVERAL PORTIONS OF DISTILLED WATER FOR DAYS TOGETHER UNTIL EVERY TRACE OF NITRIC ACID AND NITRATE OF LEAD HAD BEEN REMOVED AFTER WHICH IT WAS WELL AND PERFECTLY DRIED STILL WHEN A HEAP OF IT IN POWDER AND CONSEQUENTLY IN VERY IMPERFECT CONTACT THROUGHOUT ITS OWN MASS WAS PRESSED BETWEEN TWO PLATES OF PLATINUMN AND SO BROUGHT INTO THE THERMOELECTRIC CIRCUIT 1813 THE CURRENT WAS FOUND TO PASS READILY  II INACTIVE CONDUCTING CIRCLES CONTAINING A FLUID OR ELECTROLYTE 1823 DE LA RIVE HAS ALREADY QUOTED THE CASE OF POTASH IRON AND PLATINA TO SHOW THAT WHERE THERE WAS NO CHEMICAL ACTION THERE WAS NO CURRENT MY OBJECT IS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SUCH CASES TO USE OTHER FLUIDS THAN POTASH AND SUCH AS HAVE GOOD CONDUCTING POWER FOR WEAK CURRENTS TO USE ALSO STRONG AND WEAK SOLU TIONS AND THUS TO ACCUMULATE THE CONJOINT EXPERIMENTAL AND ARGUMENTATIVE EVIDENCE BY WHICH THE GREAT QUESTION MUST FINALLY BE DECIDED 1824 I FIRST USED THE SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM AS AN ELECTROLYTE OF GOOD CONDUCTING POWER BUT CHEMICALLY INACTIVE 1811 WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH IRON AND PLATINUM IN A CIRCUIT THE ARRANGEMENT IS GIVEN IN FIG 2 WHERE D E REPRESENT TWO TESTGLASSES CONTAINING THE STRONG SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1812 AND ALSO FOUR METALLIC PLATES ABOUT 05 OF AN INCH WIDE AND TWO INCHES LONG IN THE IMMERSED PART OF WHICH THE THREE MARKED P P P WERE PLATINUM AND THAT MARKED I OF CLEAN IRON THESE WERE CONNECTED BY IRON AND PLATINUM WIRES AS IN FIG 2 A GALVANOMETER BEING  PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE 1837 XI 275INACTIVE CONDUCTING VOLTAIC CIRCLESSULPHURET OF POTASSA 69 INTRODUCED AT G IN THIS ARRANGEMENT THERE WERE THREE METALLIC CONTACTS OF PLATINUM AND IRON A B AND X THE TWO FIRST BEING OPPOSED TO EACH OTHER MAY BE CONSIDERED AS NEUTRALIZING EACH OTHERS FORCES BUT THE THIRD BEING UNOPPOSED BY ANY OTHER ME TALLIC CONTACT CAN BE COMPARED WITH EITHER THE DIFFERENCE OF A AND B WHEN ONE IS WARMER THAN THE OTHER OR WITH ITSELF WHEN IN A HEATED OR COOLED STATE 1830 OR WITH THE FORCE OF CHEMICAL ACTION WHEN ANY BODY CAPABLE OF SUCH ACTION IS INTRODUCED THERE 1831 1825 WHEN THIS ARRANGEMENT IS COMPLETED AND IN ORDER THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO CURRENT CIRCULATING THROULGH IT AND THE GALVANOMETERNEEDLE RESTS AT 00 YET IS THE WHOLE CIRCUIT OPEN TO A VERY FEEBLE CURRENT FOR A DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE AT ANY ONE OF THE JUNCTIONS A B OR X CAUSES A CORRESPONDING THERMO CURRENT WHICH IS INSTANTLY DETECTED BY THE GALVANOMNETER THE NEEDLE STANDING PERMANENTLY AT 300 OR 400 OR EVEN 50 1826 BUT TO OBTAIN THIS PROPER AND NORMAL STATE IT IS NECESSARY THAT CERTAIN PRE CAUTIONS BE ATTENDED TO IN THE FIRST PLACE IF THE CIRCUIT BE COMPLETE IN EVERY PART EXCEPT FOR THE IMMERSION OF THE IRON AND PLATINUM PLATES INTO THE CUP D THEN UPON THEIR INTRODUCTION A CURRENT WILL BE PRODUCED DIRECTED FROM THE PLATINUM WHICH AP PEARS TO BE POSITIVE THROUGH THE SOLUTION TO THE IRON THIS WILL CONTINUE PERHAPS FIVE OR TEI MINUTES OR IF THE IRON HAS BEEN CARELESSLY CLEANED FOR SEVERAL HOURS IT IS DUE TO AN ACTION OF THE SULPHURETTED SOLUTION ON OXIDE OF IRON AND NOT TO ANY EFFECT ON THE METALLIC IRON AND WHEN IT HAS CEASED THE DISTURBING CAUSE MAY BE CONSIDERED AS EXHAUSTED THE EXPERIMENTAL PROOFS OF THE TRUTH OF THIS EXPLANATION I WILL QUOTE HEREAFTER 2049 1827 ANOTHER PRECAUTION RELATES TO THE EFFECT OF ACCIDENTAL MOVEMENTS OF THE PLATES IN THE SOLUTION IF TWO PLATINUM PLATES BE PUT INTO A SOLUTION OF THIS SULPHURET OF PO TASSIUM AND THE CIRCUIT BE THEN COMPLETED INCLUDING A GALVANOMETER THE ARRANGE MENT IF PERFECT WILL SHOW NO CURRENT BUT IF ONE OF THE PLATES BE LIFTED UP INTO THE AIR FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN REPLACED IT WILL BE NEGATIVE TO THE OTHER AND PRODUCE A CURRENT LASTING FOR A SHORT TIME  IF THE TWO PLATES BE IRON AND PLATINUM OR OF ANY OTHER METAL OR SUBSTANCE NOT ACTED ON BY THE SULPHURET THE SAME EFFECT WILL BE PRO DUCED IN THESE CASES THE CURRENT IS DUE TO THE CHANGE WROUGHT BY THE AIR ON THE FILM OF SULPHURETTED SOLUTION ADHERING TO THE REMOVED PLATET BUT A FAR LESS CAUSE THAN THIS WILL PRODUCE A CURRENT FOR IF ONE OF THE PLATINUM PLATES BE REMOVED WASHED WELL DRIED AND EVEN HEATED IT WILL ON ITS REINTRODUCTION ALMOST CERTAINLY EXHIBIT THE NEGATIVE STATE FOR A SECOND OR TWO 1828 THESE OR OTHER DISTURBING CAUSES APPEARL THIE GREATER IN THESE EXPERIMENTS IN  MARIANINI OBSERVED EFFECTS OF THIS KIND PRODUCED BY EXPOSURE TO THE AIR OF ONE OF TWO PLATES DIPPED IN NITRIC ACID ANNALES DE CHIMIE 1830 XLV P 42 F BECQUEREL LONG SINCE REFERRED TO THE EFFECT OF SUCH EXPOSURE OF A PLATE DIPPED IN CERTAIN SOLUTIONS TO THE AIR GENERALLY THE PLATE SO EXPOSED BECAME POSITIVE ON

CARE BE TAKEN TO AVOID ANY DISTURBANCE OF THE PLATES OR THE SOLUTION AND THEN AS BEFORE SAID THE WHOLE ACQUIRES A NORMAL AND PERFECTLY INACTIVE STATE 1829 HERE THEN IS AN ARRANGEMENT IN WHICH THE CONTACT OF PLATINUM AND IRON AT V IS AT LIBERTY TO PRODUCE ANY EFFECT WHICH SUCH A CONTACT MAY HAVE THE POWER OF PRO DUCING AND YET WHAT IS THE CONSEQUENCE  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING THIS IS NOT BECAUSE THE ELECTROLYTE IS SO BAD A CONDUCTOR THAT A CURRENT OF CONTACT CANNOT PASS FOR CUR RENTS FAR FEEBLER THAN THIS IS ASSUMED TO BE PASS READILY 1813 AND THE ELECTROLYTE EMPLOYED IS VASTLY SUPERIOR IN CONDUCTING POWER TO THOSE WHICH ARE COMNIONLY USED IN VOLTAIC BATTERIES OR CIRCLES IN WHICH THE CURRENT IS STILL ASSUMED TO BE DEPENDENT UPON CONTACT THE SIMPLE CONCLUSION TO WHICH THE EXPERIMENT SHOULD LEAD IS IN MY OPINION THAT THE CONTACT OF IRON AND PLATINUM IS ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT ANY ELECTRO MOTIVE FORCE 1835 1859 1889 1830 IF THE CONTACT BE MADE REALLY ACTIVE AND EFFECTIVE ACCORDING TO THE BEAUTIFUL DISCOVERY OF SEEBECK BY MAKING ITS TEMPERATURE DIFFERENT TO THAT OF THE OTHER PARTS OF THE CIRCUIT THEN ITS POWER OF GENERATING A CURRENT IS SHOWN 1824 THIS ENABLES US TO COMPARE THE SUPPOSED POWER OF THE MERE CONTACT WITH THAT OF A THERMO CON TACT AND WE FIND THAT THE LATTER COMES OUT AS INFINITELY GREATER THAN THE FORMER FOR THE FORMER IS NOTHING THE SAME COMPARISON OF MERE CONTACT AND THERMO CONTACT MAY BE MADE BY CONTRASTING THE EFFECT OF THE CONTACT C AT COMMON TEMPERATURES WITH EITHER THE CONTACT AT A OR AT B EITHER HEATED OR COOLED VERY MODERATE CHANGES OF TEMPERATURE AT THESE PLACES PRODUCE INSTANTLY THE CORRESPONDING CURRENT BUT THE MERE CONTACT AT X DOES NOTHING 1831 SO ALSO I BELIEVE THAT A TRUE AND PHILOSOPHIC AND EVEN RIGID COMPARISON MAY BE MADE AT X BETWEEN THE ASSUMED EFFECT OF MERE CONTACT AND THAT OF CHEMICAL ACTION FOR IF THE METALS AT X BE SEPARATED AND A PIECE OF PAPER MOISTENED IN DILUTE ACID OR A SOLUTION OF SALT OR IF ONLY THE TONGUE OR A WET FINGER BE APPLIED THERE THEN A CURRENT IS CAUSED STRONGER BY FAR THAN THE THERMOCURRENTS BEFORE PRODUCED 1830 PASSING FROM THE IRON THROUGH THE INTRODUCED ACID OR OTHER ACTIVE FLUID TO THE PLATINUM THIS IS A CASE OF CURRENT FRORN CHEMICAL ACTION WITHOUT ANY METALLIC CONTACT IN THE CIRCUIT ON WHICH THE EFFECT CAN FOR A MOMENT BE SUPPOSED TO DEPEND 879 IT IS EVEN A CASE WHERE METALLIC CONTACT IS CHANGED FOR CHEMICAL ACTION WITH THE RESULT THAT WHERE CONTACT IS FOUND TO BE QUITE INEFFECTUAL CHEMICAL ACTION IS VERY ENERGETIC IN PRODUCING A CURRENT 1832 IT IS OF COURSE QUITE UNNECESSARY TO SAY THAT THE SAME EXPERIMENTAL COMPA RISONS MAY BE MADE AT EITHER OF THE OTHER CONTACTS A OR B 1833 ADMITTING FOR THE MOMENT THAT THE ARRANGEMENT PROVES THAT THE CONTACT OF PLATINUM AND IRON AT X HAS NO ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 1835 1859 THEN IT FOLLOWS ALSO THAT THE CONTACT OF EITHER PLATINUM OR IRON WITH ANY OTHER METAL HAS NO SUCH FORCE FOR IF ANOTHER METAL AS ZINC BE INTERPOSED BETWEEN THE IRON AND PLATINUM AT X FIG 2INACTIVE CONDUCTING VOLTAIC CIRCLESSULPHURET OF POTASSA 71 NO CURRENT IS PRODUCED AND YET THE TEST APPLICATION OF A LITTLE HEAT AT A OR B WILL SHOW BV THE CORRESPONDING CURRENT THAT THE CIRCUIT BEING COMPLETE WILL CONDUCT ANY CURRENT THAT MAY TEND TO PASS NOW THAT THE CONTACTS OF ZINC WITH IRON AND WITH PLATINUM ARE OF EQUAL ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE IS NOT FOR A MOMENT ADMITTED BY THOSE WHO SUPPORT THE THEORY OF CONTACT ACTIVITY WE OUGHT THEREFORE TO HAVE A RESULTING ACTION EQUAL TO THE DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO FORCES PRODUCING A CERTAIN CURRENT NO SUCH CURRENT IS PRODUCED AND I CONCEIVE WITH THE ADMISSION ABOVE THAT SUCH A RESULT PROVES THAT THE CONTACTS IRONZINC AND PLATINUMZINC ARE ENTIRELY WITHOUT ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE 1834 GOLD SILVER POTASSIUM AND COPPER WERE INTRODUCED AT X WITH THE LIKE NE GATIVE EFFECT AND SO NO DOUBT MIGHT EVERY OTHER METAL EVEN ACCORDING TO THE RELA TION ADMITTED AMONGST THE METALS BY THE SUPPORTERS OF THE CONTACT THEORY 1809 THE SAME NEGATIVE RESULT FOLLOWED UPON THLE INTRODUCTION OF MANY OTHER CONDUCTING BODIES AT THE SAME PLACE AS FOR INSTANCE THOSE ALREADY MENTIONED AS EASILY CON DUCTING THE THERMO CURRENT 1820 AND THE EFFECT PROVES I THINK THAT THE CONTACT OF ANY OF THESE WITH EITHER IRON OR PLATINUM IS UTTERLY INEFFECTIVE AS A SOURCE OF ELEC TROMOTIVE FORCE 1835 THE ONLY ANSWER WHLICH AS IT APPEARS TO ME THE CONTACT THEORY CAN SET UP IN OPPOSITION TO THE FOREGOING FACTS AND CONCLUSIONS IS TO SAY THAT THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM IN THE CUP D FIG 2 ACTS AS A METAL WOULD DO 1809 AND SO THE EFFECTS OF ALL THE CONTACTS IN THE CIRCUIT ARE EXACTLY BALANCED I WILL NOT STOP AT THIS MOMENT TO SHOW THAT THE DEPARTURE WITH RESPECT TO ELECTROLYTES OR THE FLUID BODIES IN THE VOLTAIC PILE FROM THE LAW WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO HOLD GOOD WITH THE TACT THEORY OF THE VOLTAIC PILE 1810 1861 NOR TO PROVE THAT THE ELECTROLYTE IS NO OTHERWISE LIKE THE METALS THAN IN HAVING NO CONTACT ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WHATEVER BUT BELIEVING THAT THIS WILL BE VERY EVIDENT SHORTLY I WILL GO ON WITH THE EXPERI MENTAL RESULTS AND RESUME THESE POINTS HEREAFTER 1859 1889 1836 THE EXPERIMENT WAS NOW REPEATED WITH THE SUBSTITUTION OF A BAR OF NICKEL FOR THAT OF IRON FIG 2 1824 ALL OTHER THINGS REMAINING THE SAMET THE CIRCUIT WAS AGAIN FOUND TO BE A GOOD CONDUCTOR OF A FEEBLE THERMO CURRENT BUT UTTERLY INEFFICIENT AS A VOLTAIC CIRCUIT WHEN ALL WAS AT THE SAME TEMPERATURE AND DUE PRE CAUTIONS TAKEN 2051 THE INTRODUCTION OF METALS AT THE CONTACT X WAS AS INEFFEC TIVE AS BEFORE 1834 THE INTRODUCTION OF CHEMICAL ACTION AT X WAS AS STRIKING IN ITS INFLUENCE AS IN THE FORMER CASE 1831 ALL THE RESULTS WERE IN FACT PARALLEL TO  SEE FECHNERS WORDS PHILOSOPHICAL MAGAZINE 1838 XIII 377 F THERE IS ANOTHER FORM OF THIS EXPERIMENT WHICH I SOMETIMES ADOPTED IN WHICH THE CUP E FIG 2 WITH ITS CONTENTS WAS DISMISSED AND THE PLATINUM PLATES IN IT CONNECTED TOGETHER THE ARRANGEMENT MAY THEN BE CON SIDERED AS PRESENTING THREE CONTACTS OF IRON AND PLATINUM TWO ACTING IN ONE DIRECTION AND ONE IN THE OTHER THE ARRANGEMENT AND THE RESULTS ARE VIRTUALLY THE SAME AS THOSE ALREADY GIVEN A STILL SIMPLER BUT EQUALLY CONCLUSIVE ARRANGEMENT FOR MANY OF THE ARGUMENTS IS TO DISMISS THE IRON BETWEEN A AND B ALTOGETHER AND SO HAVE BUT ONE CONTACT THAT AT X TO CONSIDER72 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI THOSE ALREADY OBTAINED AND IF THE REASONING THEN URGED WAS GOOD IT WILL NOW FOLLOW THAT THE CONTACT OF PLATINUM AND NICKEL WITH EACH OTHER OR OF EITHER WITH ANY OF THE DIFFERENT METALS OR SOLID CONDUCTORS INTRODUCED AT X IS ENTIRELY WITHOUT ELECTROINO TIVE FORCE 1837 MANY OTHER PAIRS OF METALS WERE COMPARED TOGETHER IN THE SAME MANNER THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM CONNECTING THEM TOGETHER AT ONE PLACE AND THEIR MUTUAL CONTACT DOING THAT OFFICE AT ANOTHER THE FOLLOWING ARE CASES OF THIS KIND IRON AND GOLD IRON AND PALLADIUM NICKEL AND GOLD NICKEL AND PALLADIUM PLATINA AND GOLD PLATINA AND PALLADIUM IN ALL THESE CASES THE RESULTS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE ALREADY GIVEN WITH THE COMBINATIONS OF PLATINUM AND IRON 1838 IT IS NECESSARY THAT DUE PRECAUTION BE TAKEN TO HAVE THE ARRANGEMENTS IN AN UNEXCEPTIONABLE STATE IT OFTEN HAPPENED THAT THE FIRST IMMERSION OF THE PLATES GAVE DEFLECTIONS IT IS IN FACT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO PUT TWO PLATES OF THE SAME METAL INTO THE SOLUTION WITHOUT CAUSING A DEFLECTION BUT THIS GENERALLY GOES OFF VERY QUICKLY AND THEN THE ARRANGEMENT MAY BE USED FOR THE INVESTIGATION 1826 SOMETIMES THERE IS A FEEBLE BUT RATHER PERMANENT DEFLECTION OF THE NEEDLE THUS WHEN PLATINUM AND PALLADIUM WERE THE METALS THE FIRST EFFECT FELL AND LEFT A CURRENT ABLE TO DEFLECT THE GALVANOMETERNEEDLE 3 INDICATING THE PLATINUM TO BE POSITIVE TO THE PALLADIUM THIS EFFECT OF 3 HOWEVER IS ALMOST NOTHING COMPARED TO WHAT A MERE THERMO CURRENT CAN CAUSE THE LATTER PRODUCING A DEFLECTION OF 60 OR MORE BESIDES WHICH EVEN SUPPOSING IT AN ESSENTIAL EFFECT OF THE ARRANGEMENT IT IS IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR THE CONTACT THEORY I RATHER INCLINE TO REFER IT TO THAT POWER WHICH PLATINUM AND OTHER SUBSTANCES HAVE OF EFFECTING COMLBINATION AND DECOMPOSITION WITHOUT THEMSELVES EN TERING INTO UNION AND I HAVE OCCASIONALLY FOUND THAT WHEN A PLATINUM PLATE HAS BEEN LEFT FOR SOME HOURS IN A STRONG SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1812 A SMALL QUANTITY OF SULPHUR HAS BEEN DEPOSITED UPON IT WHATEVER THE CAUSE OF THE FINAL FEEBLE CURRENT MAY BE THE EFFECT IS TOO SMALL TO BE OF ANY SERVICE IN SUPPORT OF THE CONTACT THEORY WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IT AFFORDS DELICATE AND THEREFORE STRONG INDICATIONS IN FAVOUR OF THE CHEMICAL THEORY 1839 A CHANGE WAS MADE IN THE FORM AND ARRANGEMENT OF THE CUP D FIG 2 SO AS TO ALLOW OF EXPERIMENTS WITH OTHER BODIES THAN THE METALS THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM WAS PLACED IN A SHALLOW VESSEL THE PLATINUM PLATE WAS BENT SO THAT THE IMMERSED EXTREMITY CORRESPONDED TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VESSEL ON THIS A PIECE OF LOOSELY FOLDED CLOTH WAS LAID IN THE SOLUTION AND ON THAT AGAIN THE MINERAL OR OTHER SUBSTANCE TO BE COMPARED WITH THE PLATINUM THE FLUID BEING OF SUCH DEPTH THAT ONLY PART OF THAT SUBSTANCE WAS IN IT THE REST BEING CLEAN AND DRY ON THIS PORTION THE PLATINUM WIRE WHICH COMPLETED THE CIRCUIT RESTED THE ARRANGEMENT OF THIS PART OF  ONE SPECIMEN OF NICKEL WAS ON ITS IMMERSION POSITIVE TO PLATINUM FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT MINUTES AND THEN BECAME NEUTRAL ON TAKING IT OUT IT SEEMED TO HAVE A YELLOWISH TINT ON IT AS IF INVESTED BY A COAT OF SULPHURET AND I SUSPECTED THIS PIECE HAD ACTED LIKE LEAD 1885 AND BISMUTH 1895 IT IS DIFFICULT TO GET PURE AND ALSO PERFECTLY COMPACT NICKEL AND IF POROUS THEN THE MATTER RETAINED IN THE PORES PRODUCES CURRENTSINACTIVE CONDUCTING VOLTAIC CIRCLESNITROUS ACID THE CIRCUIT IS GIVEN IN SECTION AT FIG 3 WHERE H REPRESENTS A PIECE OF GALENA TO BE COMPARED WITH THE PLATINUM P 1840 IN THIS WAY GALENA COMPACT YELLOW COPPER PYRITES YELLOW IRON PYRITES AND GLOBULES OF OXIDE OF BURNT IRON WERE COMPARED WITH PLATINUM THE SOLUTION OF SUL PHURET OF POTASSIUM BEING THE ELECTROLYTE USED IN THE CIRCUIT AND WITH THE SAME RE SULTS AS WERE BEFORE OBTAINED WITH METALS 1829 1833 1841 EXPERIMENTS HEREAFTER TO BE DESCRIBED GAVE ARRANGEMENTS IN WHICH WITH THE SAME ELECTROLYTE SULPHURET OF LEAD WAS COMPARED WITH GOLD PALLADIUM IRON NICKEL AND BISMUTH 1885 1886  ALSO SULPHURET OF BISMUTH WITH PLATINUM GOLD PALLADIUM IRON NICKEL LEAD AND SULPHURET OF LEAD 1894 AND ALWAYS WITH THE SAME RESULT WHERE NO CHEMICAL ACTION OCCURRED THERE NO CURRENT WAS FORMED ALTHOUGH THE CIR CUIT REMAINED AN EXCELLENT CONDUICTOR AND THE CONTACT EXISTED BY WHICH IT IS ASSUMED IN THE CONTACT THEORY SUCH A CURRENT SHOULD BE PRODUCED 1842 INSTEAD OFT THE RONG SOLUTION A DILUTE SOLUTION OF THE YELLOW SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM CONSISTING OF ONE VOLUME OF STRONG SOLUTION 1812 AND TEN VOLUMES OF WATER WAS USED PLATES OF PLATINUM AND IRON WERE ARRIANGED IN THIS FLUID AS BEFORE 1824 AT FIRST THE IRON WAS NEGATIVE 2049 BUT IN TEN MINUTES IT WAS NEUTRAL AND THE NEEDLE AT 0O THEN A WEAK CHEMICAL CURRENT EXCITED AT X 1831 EASILY PASSED AND EVEN A THERMO CURRENT 1830 WAS ABLE TO SHOW ITS EFFECTS AT THE NEEDLE THUS A STRONG OR A WEAK SOLUTION OF THIS ELECTROLYTE SHOWED THE SAME PHENOMENA BY DILUTING THE SOLUTION STILL FURTHER A FLUID COULD BE OBTAINED IN WHICH THE IRON WAS AFTER THE FIRST EFFECT PERMANENTLY BUT FEEBLY POSITIVE ON ALLOWING TIME LOWEVER IT WAS FOUND THAT IN ALL SUCH CASES BLACK SULPHURET FORMED HERE AND THERE ON THE IRON RUSTED IRON WAS NEGATIVE TO PLATINUM 2049 IN THIS VERY WEAK SOLUTION WHICH BY DIRECT CHEMICAL ACTION COULD RENDER METALLIC IRON POSITIVE 1843 IN ALL THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS THE ELECTROLYTE USED HAS BEEN THE SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM SOLUTION BUT I NOW CHANGED THIS FOR ANOTHER VERY DIFFERENT IN ITS NATURE NAMELY THE GREEN NITROUS ACID 1816 WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN TO BE AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY IRON AND PLATINUM WERE THE METALS EMPLOYED BOTH BEING IN THE FORM OF WIRES THE VESSEL IN WHICH THEY WERE IMMERSED WAS A TUBE LILIE THAT FORMERLY DESCRIBED 1815 IN OTHER RESPECTS THE ARRANGEMENT WAS THE SAME IN PRINCIPLE AS THOE ALREADY USED 1824 1836 THE FIRST EFFECT WAS THE PRO DUCTION OF A CURRENT THE IRON BEING POSITIVE IN THE ACID TO THE PLATINA BUT THIS QUICKLY CEASED AND THE GALVANOMETERNEEDLE CAIME TO 00 IN THIS STATE HOWEVER THE CIRCUIT COULD NOT IN ALL THINGS BE COMPARED WITH THE ONE HAVING THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF  CARE WAS TAKEN IN THESE AND THE FORMER SIMILAR CASES TO DISCHARGE THE PLATINUM SURFACE OF ANY REACTING FORCE IT MIGHT ACQUIRE FROM THE ACTION OF THE PREVIOUS CURRENT BY SEPARATING IT FROM THE OTHER METALS AND TOUCHING IT IN THE LIQUID FOR AN INSTANT WITH ANOTHER PLATINUM PLATE MDCCCXL L 7374 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI POTASSIUM FOR ITS ELECTROLYTE 1824 FOR ALTHOUGH IT COULD CONDUCT THE THERMO CURRENT OF ANTIMONY AND BISMUTH IN A CERTAIN DEGREE YET THAT DEGREE WAS VERY SMALL COMPARED TO THE POWER POSSESSED BY THE FORMER ARRANGEMENT OR TO THAT OF A CIRCLE IN WHICH THE NITROUS ACID WAS BETWEEN TWO PLATINUM PLATES 1816 THIS REMARKABLE RETARDATION IS CONSEQUENT UPON THE ASSUMPTION BY THE IRON OF THAT PECULIAR STATE WHICH SCHCENBEIN HAS SO WELL DESCRIBED AND ILLUSTRATED BY HIS NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATIONS BUT THOUGH IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT THE IRON IN CONTACT WITH THE ACID IS IN A PECULIAR STATE 1951 2001 2033 YETT ITS ALSO EVIDENT THAT A CIR CUIT CONSISTING OF PLATINUM IRON PECULIAR IRON AND NITROUS ACID DOES NOT CAUSE A CURRENT THOUGH IT HAVE SUFFICIENT CONDUCTING POWER TO CARRY A THERMO CURRENT 1844 BUT IF THE CONTACT OF PLATINUM AND IRON HAS AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE WHY DOES IT NOT PRODUCE A CURRENT THE APPLICATION OF HEAT 1830 OR OF A LITTLE CHEMICAL AC TION 1831 AT THE PLACE OF CONTACT DOES PRODUCE A CURRENT AND IN THE LATTER CASE A STRONG ONE OR IF ANY OTHER OF THE CONTACTS IN THE ARRANGEMENT CAN PRODUCE A CUR RENT WHY IS NOT THAT SHOWN BY SOME CORTRESPONDING EFFECT THE ONLY ANSWERS ARE TO SAY THAT THE PECULIAR IRON HAS THE SAME ELECTROMOTIVE PROPERTIES AND RELATIONS AS PLATINUM OR THAT THE NITROUS ACID IS INCLUDED UNDER THE SAME LAW WITH THE METALS 1809 1835  AND SO THE SUM OF THE EFFECTS OF ALL THE CONTACTS IN THE CIRCUIT IS NOUGHT OR AN EXACT BALANCE OF FORCES THAT THE IRON IS LIKE THE PLATINUM IN HAVING NO ELECTRO MOTIVE FORCE AT ITS CONTACTS WITHOUT CHEMRNICAL ACTION I BELIEVE BUT THAT IT IS UNLIKE IT IN ITS ELECTRICAL RELATIONS IS EVIDENT FROM THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IN STRONG NITRIC ACID AS WELL AS IN WEAK ACID FROM THEIR DIFFERENCE IN THE POWER OF TRANSMITTING ELECTRIC CURRENTS TO EITHER NITRIC ACID OR SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM WHICH IS VERY GREAT AND ALSO BY OTHER DIFFERENCES THAT THE NITROUS ACID IS AS TO THE POWER OF ITS CON TACTS TO BE SEPARATED FROM OTHER ELECTROLYTES AND CLASSED WITH THE METALS IN WHAT IS WITH THETM ONLY AN ASSUMPTION IS A GRATUITOUS MODE OF EXPLAINING THE DIFFICULTY WHICH WILL COME INTO CONSIDERATION WITH THE CASE OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM HEREAFTER 1835 1859 1889 2060 1845 TO THE ELECTROCHEMICAL PHILOSOPHER THE CASE IS ONLY ANOTHER OF THE MANY STRONG INSTANCES SHOWING THAT WHERE CHEMICAL ACTION IS ABSENT IN THE VOLTAIC CIRCUIT THERE NO CURRENT CAN BE FORMED AND THAT WHETHER SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTAS SIUM OR NITROUS ACID BE THE ELECTROLYTE OR CONNECTING FLUID USED STILL THE RESULTS ARE THE SAME AND CONTACT IS SHOWN TO BE INEFFICACIOUS AS AN ACTIVE ELECTROMOTIVE CON DITION 1846 I NEED NOT SAY THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF DIFFERENT METALS BETWEEN THE IRON AND PLATINUM AT THEIR POINT OF CONTACT PRODUCED NO DIFFERENCE IN THE RESULTS 1833 1834 AND CAUSED NO CURRENT AND I HAVE SAID THAT HEAT AND CHEMTNICAL ACTION APPLIED THERE PRODUCED THEIR CORRESPONDING EFFECTS BUT THESE PARALLELS IN ACTION AND NONACTION SHOW THE IDENTITY IN NATURE OF THIS CIRCUIT NOTWITHSTANDING THE PRODUCTION OF THE SURFACE OF PECULIAR IRON ON THAT METAL AND THAT WITH SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF PO TASSIUM  SO THAT ALL THE CONCLUSIONS DRAWN FROM IT APPLY HERE ANDL IF THAT CASEINACTIVE CONDUCTING VOLTAIC CIRCLESACIDS ULTIMATELY STAND FIRM AS A PROOF AGAINST THE THEORY OF CONTACT FORCE THIS WILL STAND ALSO 1847 1 NOW USED OXIDE OF IRON AND PLATINUM AS THE EXTREMES OF THE SOLID PART OF THE CIRCUIT AND THE NITROUS ACID AS THE FLUID I E I HEATED THE IRON WIRE IN THE LALE OF A SPIRITLAMP COVERING IT WITH A COAT OF OXIDE IN THE MANNER RECOMMNENDED BY SCHEN BEIN IN HIS INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN USED IT INSTEAD OF THE CLEAN IRON 1843 TRHE OXIDE OF IRON WAS AT FIRST IN TE LEAST DEGREE POSITIVE AND THEN IMMEDIATELY NEUTRAL THIS CIRCUIT THEN LIKE THE FORMER GAVE NO CURRENT AT COMMON TEMPERATURES BUT IT DIFFERED MUCH FROM IT IN CONDUCTING POWER BEING A VERY EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF A THERMO CURRENT THE OXIDE OF IRON NO OFFERING THAT OBSTRUCTION TO THE PASSAGE OF THE CURRENT WHICH THE PECULIAR IRON DID 843 1844 HENCE SCALE OXIDE OF IRON AND PLATINUM PRODUCE NO CURRENT BY CONTACT THE THIRD SUBSTANCE IN THE PROOF CIRCUIT BEING NITROUS ACID AND SO THE RESULT AGREES WITH THAT OBTAINED IN THE FORMER CASE WHERE THAT THIRD SUBSTANCE WAS SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1848 IN USING NITROUS ACID IT IS NECESSARY THAT CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS BE TAKEN FOUNDED ON THE FOLLO G EFFECT IF A IRCUT BE IADE WITH THE OGREEN NITROUS ACID PLATINUM WIRES AND A GALVANOMETER IN A FEW SECONDS ALL TRACES OF A CURRENT DUE TO FIRST DIS TURBANCES WILL DISAPPEAR BUT IF ONE WIRE BE RAISED INTO THE AIR AND INSTANTLY RETURNED TO ITS FIRST POSITION A CURRENT IS FORMNED AND THAT WIRE IS NEGATIVE ACROSS THE ELECTROLYTE TO THE OTHER IF ONE WIRE BE IPPED ONLY A SMALL DISTANCE INTO THE ACD AS FOR INSTANCE ONE FOURTH OF AN INCH THEN THE RAISING THAT WIRE NOT MORE THAN ONE EIGHTHI OF AN INCH AND INSTANTLY RESTORING IT WILL PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT AS BEFORE THE EFFECT IS DUE TO THE EVAPORATION OF THE NITROUS ACID FROTN THE EXPOSED WIRE 1937 I MAY PERHAPS RETURN TO IT HEREAFTER BUT WISH AT PRESENT ONLY TO GIVE NOTICE OF THE PRECAU TION THAT IS REQUIRED IN CONSEQUENCE NAMELY TO RETAIN THE IMMERSED WIRES UNDISTURBED DURING THE EXPERIMENT 1849 PROCEEDING ON THE FACTS MADE KNOWN BY SCHCENBEIN RESPECTING THE RELATION OF IRON AND NITRIC ACID I USED THAT ACID AS THE FLUID IN A VOLTAIC CIRCUIT FORMED WITH IRON AND PLATINUM PURE NITRIC ACID IS SO DEFICIENT IN CONDUCTING POWER 1817 THAT IT MAY BE SUPPOSED CAPABLE OF STOPPING ANY CURRENT DUE TO THE EFFECT OF CONTACT BE TWEEN THE PLATINUM AND IRON AND IT IS FURTHER OBJECTIONABLE IN THESE EXPERIMENTS BE CAUSE ACTING FEEBLY ON THE IRON IT PRODUCES A CHEMICALLY EXCITED CURRENT WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED AS MINGLING ITS EFFECT WITH THAT OF CONTACT WHEREAS THE OBJECT AT PRE SENT IS BY EXCLUDING SUCH CHEMICAL ACTION TO LAY BARE THE INFLUENCE OF CONTACT ALONE STILL THE RESULTS WITH IT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE MORE PERFECT ONES ALREADY DESCRIBED FOR IN A CIRCUIT OF IRON PLATINUM AND NITRIC ACID THE JOINT EFFECTS OF THE CHEMICAL ACTION ON THE IRON AND THE CONTACT OF IRON AND PLATINUMN BEING TO PRODUCE A CURRENT OF A CER TAIN CONSTANT FORCE INDICATED BY THE GALVANOMETER A LITTLE CHEMICAL ACTION BROUGHT INTO PLAY WHERE THE IRON AND PLATINUM WERE IN CONTACT AS BEFORE 1831 PRODUCED A L2 7576 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI CURRENT FAR STRONGER THAN THAT PREVIOUSLY EXISTING IF THEN FROM THE WEAKER CURRENT THE PART OF THE EFFECT DUE TO CHEMICAL ACTION BE ABSTRACTED HOW LITTLE ROOM IS THERE TO SUPPOSE THAT ANY EFFECT IS DUE TO THE CONTACT OF THE METALS 1850 BUT A RED NITRIC ACID WITH PLATINUM PLATES CONDUCTS A THERMO CURRENT WELL AND WILL DO SO EVEN WHEN CONSIDERABLY DILUTED 1818 WHEN SUCH RED ACID IS USED BE TWEEN IRON AND PLATINUM THE CONDUCTING POWER IS SUCH THAT ONE HALF OF THE PERMANENT CURRENT CAN BE OVERCOME BY A COUNTER THERMO CURRENT OF BISMUTH AND ANTIMONY THUS A SORT OF COTMPARISON IS ESTABLISLHED BETWEEN A THERMO CURRENT ON THE ONE HAND AND A CURRENT DUE TO THE JOINT EFFECTS OF CHEMICAL ACTION ON IRON AND CONTACT OF IRON AND PLATINUM ON THE OTHER NOW CONSIDERING THE ADMITTED WEAKNESS OF A THERMO CURRENT IT MAY BE JUDGED WHAT THE STRENGTH OF THAT PART OF THE SECOND CURRENT DUE TO CONTACT CAN AT THE UTMOST BE AND HOW LITTLE IT IS ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE STRONG CURRENTS PRODUCED BY ORDINARY VOLTAIC COMBINATIONS 1851 IF FOR A CLEAN IRON WIRE ONE OXIDIZED IN THE FLAME OF A SPIRITLAMP BE USED BEING ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM IN PURE STRONG NITRIC ACID THERE IS A FEEBLE CURRENT THE OXIDE OF IRON BEING POSITIVE TO THE PLATINUM AND THE FACTS MAINLY AS WITH IRON BUT THE FURTHER ADVANTAGE IS OBTAINED OF COMPARING THE CONTACT OF STRONG AND WEAK ACID WITH THIS OXIDIZED WIRE IF ONE VOLUME OF THE STRONG ACID AND FOUR VOLUMES OF WATER BE MIXED THIS SOLUTION MAY BE USED AND THERE IS EVEN LESS DEFLECTION THAN WITH THE STRONG ACID THE IRON SIDE IS NOW NOT SENSIBLY ACTIVE EXCEPT THE MOST DELICATE MEANS BE USED TO OBSERVE THE CURRENT YET IN BOTH CASES IF A CHEMICAL ACTION BE INTRODUCED IN PLACE OF THE CONTACT THE RESULTING CURRENT PASSES WELL AND EVEN A THERMTO CURRENT CAN BE MADE TO SHOW ITSELF AS MORE POWERFUL THAN ANY DUE TO CONTACT 1852 IN THESE CASES IT IS SAFEST TO PUT THE WHOLE OF THE OXIDIZED IRON UNDER THE SURFACE AND CONNECT IT IN THE CIRCLE BY TOUCHING IT WITH A PLATINUM WIRE FOR IF THE OXIDIZED IRON BE CONTINUED THROUGH FROM THE ACID TO THE AIR IT IS ALMOST CERTAIN TO SUFFER FIROM THE JOINT ACTION OF THE ACID AND AIR AT THEIR SURFACE OF CONTACT 1853 I PROCEEDED TO USE A FLUID DIFFERING FIOM ANY OF THE FORMER THIS WAS SOLUTION OF POTASSA WHICH HAS ALREADY BEEN EMPLOYED BY DE LA RIVE 1823 WITH IRON AND PLATINA AND WHICH WHEN STRONG HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE A SUBSTANCE CONDUCTING SO WELL THAT EVEN A THERMO CURRENT COULD PASS IT 1819 AND THEREFORE FULLY SUFFICIENT TO SHOW A CONTACT CURRENT IF ANY SUCH EXISTS 1854 YET WHEN A STRONG SOLUTION OF THIS SUBSTANCE WAS ARRANGED WITH SILVER AND PLATINUM BODIES DIFFERING SUFFICIENTLY FROM EACH OTHER WHEN CONNECTED BY NITRIC OR MURIATIC ACID AS IN THE FORMER CASES A VERY FEEBLE CURRENT WAS PRODUCED AND THE GALVANOMETERNEEDLE STOOD NEARLY AT ZERO THE CONTACT OF THESE METALS THEREFORE DID NOT APPEAR TO PRODUCE A SENSIBLE CURRENT AND AS I FULLY BELIEVE BECAUSE NO ELECTRO MOTIVE POWER EXISTS IN SUCH CONTACT WHEN THAT CONTACT WAS EXCHANGED FOR A VERY FEEBLE CHEMICAL ACTION NAMELY THAT PRODUCED BY INTERPOSING A LITTLE PIECE OF PAPERINACTIVE CONDUCTING VOLTAIC CIRCLESALKALIES MOISTENED IN DILUTE NITRIC ACID 1831 A CURRENT WAS THE RESULT SO HERE AS IN THE MANY FORMER CASES TILE ARRANGEMENT WITH A LITTLE CHEMICAL ACTION AND NO METALLIC CON TACT PRODUCES A CURRENT BUT THAT WITHOUT THE CHEMICAL ACTION AND WITH THE METALLIC CONTACT PRODUCES NONE 1855 IRON OR NICKEL ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM IN THIS STRONG SOLUTION OF POTASSA WAS POSITIVE THE FORCE OF THE PRODUCED CURRENT SOON FELL AND AFTER AN HOUR OR SO WAS VERY SMALL THEN ANNULLING THE METALLIC CONTACT AT X FIG 2 AND SUBSTITUTING A FEEBLE CHEMICAL ACTION THERE AS OF DILUTE NITRIC ACID THE CURRENT ESTABLISHED BY THE LATTER WOULD PASS AND SHOW ITSELF THUS THE CASES ARE PARALLEL TO THOSE BEFORE MENTIONED 1849 C AND SHOW HOW LITTLE CONTACT ALONE COULD DO SINCE THE EFFECT OF THE CONJOINT CONTACT OF IRON AND PLATINUM AND CHEMICAL ACTION OF POTASH AND IRON WERE VERY SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THE CONTRASTED CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE DILUTE NITRIC ACID 1856 INSTEAD OF A STRONG SOLUTION OF POTASSA A MUCH WEAKER ONE CONSISTING OF ONE VOLUME OF STRONG SOLUTION AND SIX VOLUMNES OF WATER WAS USED BUT THE RESULTS WITH THE SILVER AND PLATINUM WERE THE SAME NO CURRENT WAS PRODUCED BY THE METALLIC CONTACT AS LONG AS THAT ONLY WAS LEFT FOR EXCITING CAUSE BUT ON SUBSTITUTING A LITTLE CHEMICAL ACTION IN ITS PLACE 1831 THE CURRENT WAS IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED 1857 IRON AND NICKEL WITH PLATINUM IN THE WEAK SOLUTION ALSO PRODUCED SIMILAR RESULTS EXCEPT THAT THE POSITIVE STATE OF THESE MLETALS WAS RATHER MORE PERMANENT THAN WITH THE STRONG SOLUTION STILL IT WAS SO SMALL AS TO BE OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED ACCORDING TO THE CONTACT THEORY 1858 THUS THESE DIFFLERENT CONTACTS OF METALS AND OTHER WELLCONDUCTING SOLID LBODIES PROVE UTTERLY INEFFICIENT IN PRODULCING A CURRENT AS WELL WHEN SOLUTION OF POT ASSA IS THE THIRD OR FLUID BODY IN THE CIRCUIT AS WHEN THAT THIRDBODY IS EITHER SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM OR HYDRATED NITROUS ACID OR NITRIC ACID OR MLIXED NITRIC AND NITROUS ACIDS FURTHER ALL THE ARGUMENTS RESPECTING THE INEFFICACY OF THE CONTACTS OF BODIES INTERPOSED AT THE JUNCTION OF THE TWO PRINCIPAL SOLID SUBSTANCES WHICH WERE ADVANCED IN THE CASE OF THE SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM SOLUTION 1833 APPLY HERE WITH POTASSA AS THEY DO INDEED IN EVERY CASE OF A CONDUCTING CIRCUIT WHERE THE INTER POSED FLUID IS WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION AND NO CURRENT IS PRODUCED IF A CASE COULD BE BROUGHT FORLWARD IN WFVLICH THE INTERPOSED FLUID IS WITHOUT ACTION IS YET A SUFFICIENTLY GOOD CONDUCTOR AND A CURRENT IS PRODUCED THEN INDEED THE THEORY OF CONTACT WOULD FIND EVIDENCE IN ITS FAVOUR WHICH AS FAR AS I CAN PERCEIVE COULD NOT BE OVERCOME I HAVE MOST ANXIOUSLY SOUGHT FOR SUCH A CASE BUT CANNOT FIND ONE 1798 1859 THE ARGUMENT IS NOW IN A FIT STATE FOR THE RESUMPTION OF THAT IMPORTANT POINT BEFORE ADVERTED TO 1835 1844 WHICH IF TRULY ADVANCED BY AN ADVOCATE FOR THE 7778 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI CONTACT THEORY WOULD UTTERLY ANNIHILATE THE FORCE OF THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTAL RE SULTS THOUGH IT WOULD NOT ENABLE THAT THEORY TO GIVE A REASON FOR THE ACTIVITY OF AND THE EXISTENCE OF A CURRENT IN THE PILE BUT WHICH IF IN ERROR WOULD LEAVE THE CONTACT THEORY UTTERLY DEFENCELESS AND WITHOUT FOUNDATION 1860 A SUPPORTER OF THE CONTACT THEORY MAY SAY THAT THE VARIOUS CONDUCTING ELEC TROLYTES USED IN THE PREVIOUS EXPERIMENTS ARE LIKE THE METALS I E THAT THEY HAVE AN ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE AT THEIR POINTS OF CONTACT WITH THE METALS AND OTHER SOLID CONDUC TORS EMPLOYED TO COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT BUT THAT THIS IS OF SUCH CONSISTENT STRENGTH AT EACH PLACE OF CONTACT THAT IN A COMPLETE CIRCLE THE SUM OF THE FORCES IS 0 1809 THE ACTIONS AT THE CONTACTS ARE TENSE ELECTROMOTIVE ACTIONS BUT BALANCED AND SO NO CURRENT IS PRODUCED BUT WHAT EXPERIMENT IS THERE TO SUPPORT THIS STATEMENT WHERE ARE THE MEASURED ELECTROMOTIVE RESULTS PROVING IT 1808  I BELIEVE THERE ARE NONE 1861 THE CONTACT THEORY AFTER ASSUMING THAT MERE CONTACTS OF DISSIMILAR SUB STANCES HAVE ELECTROMOTIVE POWERS FURTHER ASSUMES A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN METALS AND LIQUID CONDUCTORS 1810 WITHOUT WHICH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE THAT THE THEORY CAN EXPLAIN THE CURRENT IN THE VOLTAIC PILE FOR WHILST THE CONTACT EFFECTS IN A METALLIC CIRCUIT ARE ASSUMED TO BE ALWAYS PERFECTLY BALANCED IT IS ALSO ASSUMED THAT THE CONTACT EFFECTS OF THE ELECTROLYTES OR INTERPOSED FLUID WITH THE METALS ARE NOT BALANCED BUT ARE SO FAR REMOVED FROM ANYTHING LIKE AN EQUILIBRIUM AS TO PRODUCE MOST POWERFUL CURRENTS EVEN THE STRONGEST THAT A VOLTAIC PILE CAN PRODUCE IF SO THEN WHY SHOULD THE SOLU TION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM BE AN EXCEPTION  IT IS QUITE UNLIKE THE METALS IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO CONDUCT WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION IT IS AN EXCELLENT ELECTROLYTE AND AN EXCELLENT EXCITING ELECTROLYTE IN PROPER CASES 1880 PRODUCING MOST POWERFUL CUR RENTS WHEN IT ACTS CHEMICALLY IT IS IN ALL THESE POINTS QUITE UNLIKE THE METALS AND IN ITS ACTION LIKE ANY OF THE ACID OR SALINE EXCITING ELECTROLYTES COMMONLY USED HOW THEN CAN IT BE ALLOWED THAT WITHOUT A SINGLE DIRECT EXPERIMENT AND SOLELY FOR THE PURPOSE OF AVOIDING THE FORCE OF THOSE WHICH ARE PLACED IN OPPOSITION WE SHOULD SUP POSE IT TO LEAVE ITS OWN STATION AMONGST THE ELECTROLYTES AND CLASS WITH THE METALS AND THAT TOO IN A POINT OF CHARACTER WHICH EVEN WITH THEM IS AS YET A MERE ASSUMP TION 1809 1862 BUT IT IS NOT WITH THE SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM ALONE THAT THIS FREEDOM MUST BE ALLOWED IT MUST BE EXTENDED TO THE NITROUS ACID 1843 1847 TO THE NITRIC ACID 1849 C AND EVEN TO THE SOLUTION OF POTASH 1854 ALL THESE BEING OF THE CLASS OF ELECTROLYTES AND YET EXHIBITING NO CURRENT IN CIRCUITS WHERE THEY DO NOT OCCASION CHEMICAL ACTION FURTHER THIS EXCEPTION MUST BE MADE FOR WEAK SOLUTIONS OF SUL PHURET OF POTASSIUTN 1842 AND OF POTASSA 1856 FOR THEY EXHIBIT THE SAME PHE NOMENA AS THE STRONGER SOLUTIONS AND IF THE CONTACT THEORISTS CLAIM IT FOR THESE WEAK SOLUTIONS THEN HOW WILL THEY MEET THE CASE OF WEAK NITRIC ACID WHICH IS NOT SIMILAR IN ITS ACTION ON IRON TO STRONG NITRIC ACID 1977 BUT CAN PRODUCE A POWERFUL CURRENTCHEMICAL AND CONTACT THEORIES COMPARED 1863 THE CHEMICAL PHILOSOPHER IS EMBARRASSED BY NONE OF THESE DIFFICULTIES  FOR HE FIRST BY A SIMNPLE DIRECT EXPERIMENT ASCERTAINS WHETHER ANY OF THE TWO GIVEN SUB STANCES IN THE CIRCUIT ARE ACTIVE CHEMICALLY ON EACH OTHER IF THEY ARE HE EXPECTS AND FINDS THE CORRESPONDING CURRENT IF THEY ARE NOT HE EXPECTS AND HE FINDS NO CURRENT THOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE A GOOD CONDUCTOR AND HE LOOK CAREFULLY FOR IT 1829 1864 AGAIN TAKING THE CASE OF IRON PLATINA AND SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTAS SIUM THERE IS NO CURRENT BUT FOR IRON SUBSTITUTE ZINC AND THERE IS A POWERFUL CUR RENT I MIGHT FOR ZINC SUBSTITUTE COPPER SILVER TIN CADMIUM BISMUTH LEAD AND OTHER METALS BUT I TAKE ZINC BECAUSE ITS SULPHURET DISSOLVES AND IS CARRIED OFF BY THE SOLUTION AND SO LEAVES THE CASE IN A VERY SIMPLE STATE THE FACT HOWEVER IS AS STRONG WITH ANY OF THE OTHER METALS NOW IF THE CONTACT THEORY BE TRUE AND IF THE IRON PLATINA AND SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUN GIVE CONTACTS WHICH ARE IN PERFECT EQUILIBRIUM AS TO THEIR ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE THEN WHY DOES CHANGING THE IRON FOR ZINC DESTROY THE EQUILIBRIUM  CHANGING ONE METAL FOR ANOTHER IN A MLETALLIC CIRCUIT CAUSES NO ALTERATION OF THIS KIND NOR DOES CHANGING ONE SUBSTANCE FOR ANOTHER AMONG THE GREAT NUMBER OF BODIES WHICH AS SOLID CONDUCTORS MAY BE USED TO FORM CONDUCTING BUT CHEMICALLY INACTIVE CIRCUITS 1867 C IF THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTAS SIUM IS TO BE CLASSED WITH THE METALS AS TO ITS ACTION IN THE EXPERIMENTS I HAVE QUOTED 1825 C THEN HOW COMES IT TO ACT QUITE UNLIKE THEM AND WITH A POWER EQUAL TO THE BEST OF THE OTHER CLASS IN THE NEW CASES OF ZINC COPPER SILVER C 1882 1885 C 1865 THIS DIFFICULTY AS I CONCEIVE MUST BE MET ON THE PART OF THE CONTACT THEORISTS BY A NEW ASSUMPTION NAMELY THAT THIS FLUID SOMETIMES ACTS AS THE BEST OF THE ME TALS OR FIRST CLASS OF CONDUCTORS AND SOMETIMES AS THE B6ST OF THE ELECTROLYTES OR SE COND CLASS BUT SURELY THIS WOULD BE FAR TOO LOOSE A METHOD OF PHILOSOPHIZING IN AN EXPERIMENTAL SCIENCE 1889 AND FURTHER IT IS MOST UNFORTUNATE FOR SUCH AN AS SUMPTION THAT THIS SECOND CONDITION OR RELATION OF IT NEVER COMES ON BY ITSELF SO AS TO GIVE US A PURE CASE OF A CURRENT FROM CONTACT ALONE IT NEVER COMES ON WITHOUT THAT CHEMICAL ACTION TO WHICH THE CHEMIST SO SINIPLY REFERS ALL THE CURRENT WHICH IS THEN PRODUCED 1866 IT IS UNNECESSARY FOR ME TO SAY THAT THE SAME ARGUMENT APPLIES WITH EQUAL FORCE TO THE CASES WHERE NITROUS ACID NITRIC ACID AND SOLUTION OF POTASH ARE USED AND IT IS SUPPORTED WITH EQUAL STRENGTH BY THE RESULTS WHICH THEY HAVE GIVEN 1843 1849 1853 1867 IT MAY BE THOUGHT THAT IT WAS QUITE UNNECESSARY BUT IN MY DESIRE TO ESTA BLISH CONTACT ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE TO DO WHICH I WAS AT ONE TIME VERY ANXIOUS I MADE MANY CIRCUITS OF THREE SUBSTANCES INCLUDING A GALVANOMETER ALL BEING CONDUCTORS WITH THE HOPE OF FINDING AN ARRANGEMENT WHICH WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION SHOULD PRO DUCE A CURRENT THE NUMBER AND VARIETY OF THESE EXPERIMENTS MAY BE UNDERSTOOD 7980 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI

SULPHURET OF COPPER IS POSITIVE TO IRON 1878 AND WITH THEM ALSO IRON IS POSITIVE TO COPPER THESE THREE BODIES THEREFORE OUGHT TO GIVE A MOST POWERFUL CIRCLE BUT ON THE CONTRARY WHATEVER SULPHURET OF COPPER I HAVE USED I HAVE FOUND NOT THE SLIGHTEST EFFECT FROM SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT 1869 AS PEROXIDE OF LEAD IS A BODY CAUSING A POWERFUL CURRENT IN SOLUTION OF SUL PHURET OF POTASSIUM AND INDEED IN EVERY CASE OF A CIRCUIT WHERE IT CAN GIVE UP PART OF ITS OXYGEN I THOUGHT IT REASONABLE TO EXPECT THAT ITS CONTACT WITH METALS WOULD PRODUCE A CURRENT IF CONTACT EVER COULD A PART OF THAT WHICH HAD BEEN PREPARED 1822 WAS THEREFORE WELL DRIED WHICH IS QUITE ESSENTIAL IN THESE CASES AND FORMED INTO THE FOLLOWING COMBINATIONS PLATINUM ZINC PEROXIDE OF LEAD PLATINUMA LEAD PEROXIDE OF LEAD PLATINUM CADMIUM PEROXIDE OF LEAD PLATINUM IRON PEROXIDE OF LEAD  MEMORIA DELLA SOCIETT ITALIANA IN MODENA 1827 XXI 224THEORY OF CONTACT ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE CONSIDERED OF THESE VARIED COMBINATIONS NOT ONE GAVE THE LEAST SIGNS OF A CURRENT PROVIDED DIFFERENCES OF TEMPERATURE WERE EXCLUDED THOUGH IN EVERY CASE THE CIRCLE FORMED WAS AS TO CONDUCTING POWER PERFECT FOR THE PURPOSE I E ABLE TO CONDUCT EVEN A VERY WEAK THERMO CURRENT 1870 IN THE CONTACT THEORY IT IS NOT THEREFORE THE METALS ALONE THAT MUST BE AS SUMED TO HAVE THEIR CONTACT FORCES SO BALANCED AS TO PRODUCE IN ANY CIRCLE OF THEM AN EFFECT AMOUNTING TO NOTHING 1809 BUT ALL SOLID BODIES THAT ARE ABLE TO CONDUCT WHETHER THEY BE FORMS OF CARBON OR OXIDES OR SULPHURETS MUST BE INCLUDED IN THE SAME CATEGORY SO ALSO MUST THE ELECTROLYTES ALREADY REFERRED TO NAMELY THE SOLU TIONS OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM AND POTASH AND NITROUS AND NITRIC ACIDS IN EVERY CASE WHERE THEY DO NOT ACT CHEMICALLY IN FACT ALL CONDUCTORS THAT DO NOT ACT CHE MICALLY IN THE CIRCUIT MUST BE ASSUMED BY THE CONTACT THEORY TO BE IN THIS CONDITION UNTIL A CASE OF VOLTAIC CURRENT WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION IS PRODUCED 1858 1871 THEN EVEN ADMITTING THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY VOLTA AND HIS FOLLOWERS WITH THE ELECTROMETER PROVE THAT MERE CONTACT HAS AN ELECTROMLOTIVE FORCE AND CAN PRODUCE AN EFFECT SURELY ALL EXPERIENCE WITH CONTACT ALONE GOES TO SHOW THAT THE ELEC TROMOTIVE FORCES IN A CIRCUIT ARE ALWAYS BALANCED HOW ELSE IS IT LIKELY THAT THE ABOVE NAAMED MOST VARIED SUBSTANCES SHOULD BE FOUND TO AGREE IN THIS RESPECT UNLESS INDEED IT BE AS I BELIEVE THAT ALL SUBSTANCES AGREE IN THIS OF HAVING NO SUCH POWER AT ALL IF SO THEN WHERE IS THE SOURCE OF POWER WHICH CAN ACCOUNT BY THE THEORY OF CONTACT FOR THE CURRENT IN THE VOLTAIC PILE IF THEY ARE NOT BALANCED THEN WHERE IS THE SUF FICIENT CASE OF CONTACT ALONE PRODUCING A CURRENT OR WHERE ARE THE NUMERICAL DATA WHICH INDICATE THAT SUCH A CASE CAN BE 1808 1868  THE CONTACT PHILOSOPHERS ARE BOUND TO PRODUCE NOT A CASE WHERE THE CURRENT IS INFINITESIMALLY SMALL FOR SUCH CANNOT ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT OF THE VOLTAIC PILE AND WILL ALWAYS COME WITHIN THE DEBATABLE GROUND WHICH DE LA RIVE HAS SO WELL DEFENDED BUT A CASE AND DATA OF SUCH DIS TINCTNESS AND IMPORTANCE AS MAY BE WORTHY OF OPPOSITION TO THE NUMEROUS CASES PRO DUCED BY THE CHEMICAL PHILOSOPHER 1892 FOR WITHOUT THEM THE CONTACT THEORY AS APPLIED TO THE PILE APPEARS TO ME TO HAVE NO SUPPORT AND AS IT ASSERTS CONTACT ELEC TROMOTIVE FORCE EVEN WITH THE BALANCED CONDITION TO BE ALMOST WITHOUT FOUNDATION 1872 TO AVOID THESE AND SIMILAR CONCLUSIONS THE CONTACT THEORY MUST BEND ABOUT IN THE MOST PARTICULAR AND IRREGULAR WAY THUS THE CONTACT OF SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM WITH IRON IIIUST BE CONSIDERED AS BALANCED BY THE JOINT FORCE OF ITS CONTACT WITH PLATINUM AND THE CONTACT OF IRON AND PLATINUM WITH EACH OTHER BUT CHANGING THE IRON FOR LEAD THEN THE CONTACT OF THE SULPHURET WITH THE LATTER METAL IS NO LONGER BALANCED BY THE OTHER TWO CONTACTS IT HAS ALL OF A SUDDEN CHANGED ITS RE LATION AFTER A FEW SECONDS WHEN A FILM OF SULPHURET HAS BEEN FORMED BY THE CHEMICAL ACTION THEN THE CURRENT CEASES THOUGH THE CIRCUIT BE A GOOD CONDUCTOR 1885 AND MDCCCXL M 8182 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI NOW IT MUST BE ASSUMED THAT THE SOLUTION HAS ACQUIRED ITS FIRST RELATION TO THE METALS AND TO THE SULPHURET OF LEAD AND GIVES AN EQUILIBRIUM CONDITION OF THE CONTACTS IN THE CIRCLE 1873 SO ALSO WITH THIS SULPHURETTED SOLUTION AND WITH POTASSA DILUTION MUST BY THE THEORY BE ADMITTED AS PRODUCING NO CHANGE IN THE CHARACTER OF THE CONTACT FORCE BUT WITH NITRIC ACID IT ON THE CONTRARY MUST BE ALLOWED TO CHANGE THE CHARACTER OF THE FORCE GREATLY 1977 SO AGAIN ACIDS AND ALKALIES AS POTASSA IN THE CASES WHERE CUR RENTS ARE PRODUCED BY THEM AS WITH ZINC AND PLATINUM FOR INSTANCE MUST BE ASSUMED AS GIVING THE PREPONDERANCE OF ELECTROMOTIVE FORCE ON THE SAME SIDE THOUGH THESE ARE BODIES WHICH MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED TO GIVE OPPOSITE CURRENTS SINCE THEY DIFFER SO MUCH IN THEIR NATURE 1874 EVERY CASE OF A CURRENT IS OBLIGED TO BE MET ON THE PART OF THE CONTACT AD VOCATES BY ASSUMING POWERS AT THE POINTS OF CONTACT IN THE PARTICULAR CASE OF SUCH PROPORTIONATE STRENGTHS AS WILL CONSIST WITH THE RESULTS OBTAINED AND THE THEORY IS MADE TO BEND ABOUT 1956 1992 2006 2014 2063 HAVING NO GENERAL RELATION FOR THE ACIDS OR ALKALIES OR OTHER ELECTROLYTIC SOLUTION USED THE RESULT THEREFORE COMES TO THIS THE THEORY CAN PREDICT NOTHING REGARDING THE RESULTS IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY NO CASE OF A VOLTAIC CURRENT PRODUCED WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION AND IN THOSE ASSO CIATED WITH CHEMICAL ACTION IT BENDS ABOUT TO SUIT THE REAL RESULTS THESE CONTORTIONS BEING EXACTLY PARALLEL TO THE VARIATIONS WHICH THE PURE CHEMICAL FORCE BY EXPERIMENT INDICATES 1875 IN TIHE MIDST OF ALL THIS HOW SIMPLY DOES THE CHEMICAL THEORY MEET INCLUDE COMBINE AND EVEN PREDICT THE NUMEROUS EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS WHEN THERE IS A CUR RENT THERE IS ALSO CHEMICAL ACTION WHEN THE ACTION CEASES THE CURRENT STOPS 1882 1885 1894 THE ACTION IS DETERMINED EITHER AT THE ANODE OR THE CATHODE ACCORDING TO CIRCUMSTANCES 2039 2041 AND THE DIRECTION OF THE CURRENT IS INVARIABLY ASSO CIATED WITH THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE ACTIVE CHEMICAL FORCES OBLIGE THE ANIONS AND CATIONS TO MOVE IN THE CIRCLE 962 2052 1876 NOW WHEN IN CONJUNCTION WITH THESE CIRCUMSTANCES IT IS CONSIDERED THAT THE MANY ARRANGEMENTS WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION 1825 C PRODUCE NO CURRENT THAT THOSE WITH CHEMICAL ACTION ALMOST ALWAYS PRODUCE A CURRENT THAT HUNDREDS OCCUR IN WHICH CHEMICAL ACTION WITHOUT CONTACT PRODUCES A CURRENT 2017 C AND THAT AS MANY WITH CONTACT BUT WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION 1867 ARE KNOWN AND ARE INACTIVE HOW CAN WE RESIST THE CONCLUSION THAT THE POWERS OF THE VOLTAIC BATTERY ORIGINATE IN THE EXERTION OF CHEMICAL FORCE III ACTIVE CIRCLES ECITED BY SOLUTION OF SUPHURET OFPOTASSIUM 1877 IN 1812 DAVY GAVE AN EXPERIMENT TO SHOW THAT OF TWO DIFFERENT METALS COPPER AND IRON THAT HAVING THE STRONGEST ATTRACTION FOR OXYGEN WAS POSITIVE IN OXI DIZING SOLUTIONS AND THAT HAVING THE STRONGEST ATTRACTION FOR SULPHUR WAS POSITIVE INSIJLPHURET OF POTASSIUM AN EXCITING ELECTROLYTE SULPHURETTING SOLUTIONS IN 1827 DE LA RIVE QUOTED SEVERAL SUCH INVERSIONS OF THE STATES OF TWO METALS PRODUCED BY USING DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND REASONED FROM THEM THAT THE MERE CONTACT OF THE METALS COULD NOT BE THE CAUSE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE STATES BUT THAT THE CHEMICAL ACTION OF THE LIQUID PRODUCED THESE STATEST 1878 IN A FORMER PAPER I QUOTED SIR HUMPHRY DAVYS EXPERIMENT 943 AND GAVE ITS RESULT AS A PROOF THAT THE CONTACT OF THE IRON AND COPPER COULD NOT ORIGINATE THE CURRENT PRODUCED SINE WHEN A DILUTE ACID WAS USED IN PLACE OF THE SULPHURET THE CURRENT WAS REVERSE IN DIRECTION AND YET THE CONTACT OF THE METALS REMAINED THE SAME M MARIANINI  ADDS THAT COPPER WILL PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT WITH TIN LEAD AND EVEN ZINC AND ALSO THAT SILVER WILL PRODUCE THE SAME RESULTS AS COPPER IN THE CASE OF COPPER HE ACCOUNTS FOR THE EFFECT BY REFERRING IT TO THE RELATION OF THE IRON AND THE NEW BODY FORMED ON THE COPPER THE LATTER BEING ACCORDING TO VOLTA POSITIVE TO THE FORMER  BY HIS OWN EXPERIMENT THE SAME SUBSTANCE WAS NEGATIVE TO THE IRON ACROSS THE SAME SOLUTION L 1879 I DESIRE AT PRESENT TO RESUME THE CLASS OF CASES WHERE A SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM IS THE LIQUID IN A VOLTAIC CIRCUIT FOR I THINK THEY GIVE MOST POWERFUL PROOF THAT THE CURRENT IN THE VOLTAIC BATTERY CANNOT BE PRODUCED BY CONTACT BUT IS DUE ALTOGETHER TO CHEMICAL ACTION 1880 THE SOLUTION OF STLPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1812 IS A MOST EXCELLENT CON DUCTOR OF ELECTRICITY 1814 WHEN SUBJECTED BETWEEN PLATINUM ELECTRODES TO THE DECOMPOSING POWER OF A SMALL VOLTAIC BATTERY IT READILY GAVE PURE SULPHUR AT THE ANODE AND A LITTLE GAS WHICH WAS PROBABLY HYDROGEN AT THE CATHODE WHEN AR RANGED WITH PLATINUM SURFACES SO AS TO FORM A RITTERS SECONDARY PILE THE PASSAGE OF A FEEBLE PRIMARY CURRENT FOR A FEW SECONDS ONLY MAKES THIS SECONDARY BATTERY EFFEC TIVE IN CAUSING A COUNTER CURRENT SO THAT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ELECTROLYTIC CONDUCTION 923 1343 IT PROBABLY DOES NOT CONDUCT WITHOUT DECOMPOSITION OR IF AT ALL ITS POINT OF ELECTROLYTIC INTENSITY 966 983 MUST BE VERY LOW ITS EXCITING ACTION SPEAKING ON THE CHEMICAL THEORY IS EITHER THE GIVING AN ANION SULPHUR TO SUCH METALLIC AND OTHER BODIES AS IT CAN ACT UPON OR IN SOME CASES AS WITH THE PEROXIDES OF LEAD AND MANGANESE AND THE PROTOXIDE OF IRON 2046 THE ABSTRACTION OF AN ANIONFROM THE BODY IN CONTACT WITH IT THE CURRENT PRODUCED BEING IN THE ONE OR THE OTHER DIRECTION ACCORDINGLY ITS CHEMICAL AFFINITIES ARE SUCH THAT IN MANY CASES ITS ANION GOES TO THAT METAL OF A PAIR OF METALS WHICH IS LEFT UNTOUCHED WHEN THE USUAL EXCITING ELECTROLYTES ARE EMPLOYED AND SO A BEAUTIFUL INVERSION OF THE CURRENT IN RE LATION TO THE METALS IS OBTAINED THUS WHEN COPPER AND NICKEL ARE USED WITH IT THE ANION GOES TO THE COPPER BUT WHEN THE SAME METALS ARE USED WITH THE ORDINARY ELEC TROLYTIC FLUIDS THE ANION GOES TO THE NICKEL ITS EXCELLENT CONDUCTING POWER RENDERS  ELEMENTS OF CHEMICAL PHILOSOPHY P

THE OTHER MALLEABLE METALS ABOUT ONE TWENTIETH OF AN INCH IN DIAAMETER AND SIX INCHES LONG WERE PRE PARED TWO OF THESE BEING CONNECTED WITH THE ENDS OF THE GALVANOMETERWIRES WERE PLUNGED AT THE SAME INSTANT INTO THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM IN A TESTGLASS AND KEPT THERE WITHOUT AGITATION 1919 THE EFFECTS AT THE SAME TINE BEING OBSERVED THE WIRES WERE IN EVERY CASE CAREFULLY CLEANSED WITH FRESH FINE SANDPAPER AND A CLEAN CLOTH AND WERE SOMETIMES EVEN BURNISHED BY A GLASS ROD TO GIVE THEMI A SMOOTH SURFACE PRECAUTIONS WERE TAKEN TO AVOID ANY DIFFERENCE OF TEMPERATURE AT THE JUNCTIONS OF THE DIFFERENT METALS WITH THE GALVANOMETERWIRES 1882 TIN AND PLATINUMWHEN TIN WAS ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM GOLD OR I MAY SAY ANY OTHER METAL WHICH IS CHEMICALLY INACTIVE IN THE SOLUTION OF THE SUILPHURIET A STRONG ELECTRIC CURRXENT WAS PRODUCED THE TIN BEING POSITIVE TO THE PLATINUM THROUGH THE SOLUTION OR IN OTHER WORDS THE CURRENT BEING FROM THE TIN THROUGH THE SOLUTION TO THE

THROUGH THE CIRCUIT IT WAS FOUND THAT IT COULD NOT PASS THE CIRCLE HAVING LOST ITS CONDUCTING POWER THIS WAS THE CON SEQUENCE OF THE FORMATION ON THE TIN OF AN INSOLUBLE INVESTING NONCONDUCTING SUL PHURET OF THAT NIETAL THE NONCONDLUCTING POWER OF THE BODY FORMED IS NOT ONLY EVIDENT FROM THE PRESENT RESULT BUT ALSO FROMN A FORMER EXPERIMENT 1821 1883 MARIANINI THINKS IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN THE CASE OF COPPER AT LEAST 1878 AND SO I PRESUME FOR ALL SIMILAR CASES FOR SURELY ONE LAW OR PRINCIPLE SHOULD GOVERN THEM THE CURRENT IS DUE TO THE CONTACT FORCE OF THE SULPHURET FORMED BUT THAT APPLICATION IS HERE ENTIRELY EXCLUDED FOR HOW CAN A NONCONDUCTING BODY FORM A CURRENT EITHER BY CONTACT OR IN ANY OTHER WAY  NO SUCH CASE HAS EVER BEEN SHOWN NOR IS IT IN THE NATURE OF THINGS SO THAT IT CANNOT BE THE CONTACT OF THE SULPHURET THAT HERE CAUSES THE CURRENT AND IF NOT IN THE PRESENT WHY IN ANY CASE  FOR NOTHING HAPPENS HERE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN IN ANY OTHER INSTANCE OF A CURRENT PRODUCED BY THE SAME EXCITING ELECTROLYTE 1884 ON THE OTHER HAND HOW BEAUTIFUL A PROOF THE RESULT GIVES IN CONFIRMATION OF THE CHEMICAL THEORY TIN CAN TAKE SULPHUR FROM THE ELECTROLYTE TO FORM A SULPHURET AND WHILST IT IS DOING SO AND IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE IN WHICH IT IS DOING SO ITSULPHURET OF POTASSIUMVOLTAIC CIRCLES PRODUCES A CURRENT BUT WHEN T SL THE SUPHURET W IS FORMED Y INVESTIG THE ETAL SHUTS OFF THE FLUID AND PREVENTS FURTHER CHEMICAL ACTION THEN THE CURRENT CEASES ALSO NOR IS IT NECESSARY THAT IT SHOULD BE A NONCONDUCTOR FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR CONDUCTING SULPHURETS WILL PERFORM THE SAME OFFICE 1885 1894 AND BRING ABOUT THE SAME RE SULT WHAT THEN CAN BE MOLRE CLEAR THAN THAT WHILST THE SULPHURET IS BEING FORMED A CURRENT IS PRODUCED BUT THAT WHEN FORMNED ITS MERE CONTACT CAN DO NOTHING TOWARDS SUCH AN EFFECT 1885 LEADTHIS METAL PRESENTS A FINE RESULT IN THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF PO TASSIUM LEAD AND PLATINUM BEING THE METALS USED THE LEAD WAS AT FIRST HIGHLY POSI TIVE BUT IN A FEW SECONDS TTLE CURRENT FELL AND IN TWO MINUTES THE GALVANOMETER NEEDLE WAS AT OQ STILL THE ARRANGEMENT CONDUCTED A FEEBLE THERNO CURRENT EXTREMELY WELL THE CONDUCTING POWER NOT HAVING DISAPPEARED AS IN THE CASE OF TIN FOR THE IN VESTING SULPHURET OF LEAD IS A CONDUCTOR 1820 NEVERTHELESS THOUGH A CONDUCTOR IT COULD STOP THE FURTHER CHERNICAL ACTION AND THAT CEASING THE CURRENT CEASED ALSO 1886 LEAD AND GOLD PRODUCED THE SAME EFFECT LEAD AND PALLADIUM THE SAME LEAD AND IRON THE SAME EXCEPT THAT THE CIRCUMSTANCES RESPECTING THE TENDENCY OF THE LATTER MNETAL UNDER COMMON CIRCUMSTANCES TO PRODUCE A CURRENT FROM THE ELEC TLOLYTE TO ITSELF HAVE TO BE CONSIDERED AND GUARDED AGAINST 1826 2049 LEAD AND NICKEL ALSO THE SAUE IN ALL ESE CASES WN THE LEAD WAS TAKEN OUT AND WASHED IT WAS FOUND BEAUTIFILLLY INVESTED WITH A THIN POLISHED PELLICLE OF SULPHURET OF LEAD 1887 WITH LEAD THEN WE HAVE A CONDUCTING SULPHURET FORMED BUT STILL THERE IS NO SIGN THAT ITS CONTACT CAN PRODUCE A CURRENT ANY MLORE THAN IN THE CASE OF THE NON CONDUCTING SULPHURET OF TIN 1882 THERE IS NO NEW OR ADDITIONAL ACTION PRO DUCED BY THIS CONDUCTING BODY THERE WAS NO DEFICIENCY OF ACTION WITH THE FORMER NONCONDUCTING PR ODUCT BOTH ARE ALIKE IN THEIR RESULTS BEING IN FACT ESSENTIALLY ALIKE IN THEIR RELATION TO THAT ON WHICH THE CURRENT REALLY DEPENDS NAMELY ANR ACTIVE CHE MICAL FORCE A PIECE OF LEAD PUT ALONE INTO THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM HAS ITS SURFACE CONVERTED INTO SULPHURET OF LEAD THE PROOF THUS BEING OBTAINED EVEN WHEN THE CURRENT CANNOT BE FORMEDL THAT THERE IS A FORCE CHEMICAL PRESENT AND ACTIVE UNDER SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AND SUCH FORCE CAN PRODUCE A CURRENT OF CHEMICAL FORCE WHEN THE CIRCUIT FORTN IS GIVEN TO THE ARRANGEMENT THE FORCE AT THE PLACE OF EXCITE MENT SHOWS ITSELF BOTH BY THE FORMATION OF SULPHURET OF LEAD AND THE PRODUCTION OF A CURRENT IN PROPORTION AS THE FORMATION OF THE ONE DECREASES THE PRODUCTION OF THE OTHER DIMINISHES THOUGH ALL THE BODIES PRODUCED ARE CONDUCTORS AND CONTACT STILL REMAINS TO PERFORM ANY WORK OR CAUSE ANY EFFECT TO WHICH IT IS CORMPETENT 1888 IT MAY PERHAPS BE SAID THAT THE CURRENT IS DUE TO THE CONTACT BETWEEN THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET AND THE LEAD OR TIN AS THE CASE MNAY BE WHICH OCCURS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE EXPERIMENT AND THAT WHEN THE ACTION CEASES IT IS BECAUSE A NEW BODY THE SULPHURET OF LEAD IS INTRODUCED INTO THE CIRCUIT THE VARIOUS CONTACTS BEING THEN BALANCED IN THEIR FORCE THIS WOULD BE TO FALL BACK UPON THE ASSUMPTION BEFORE 8586 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI RESISTED 1861 1865 1872 NAMELY THAT THE SOLUTION MAY CLASS WITH MNETALS AND SUCH LIKE BODIES GIVING BALANCED EFFECTS OF CONTACT IN RELATION TO SOME OF THESE BODIES AS IN THIS CASE TO THE SULPHURET OF LEAD PRODUCED BUT NOT WITH OTHERS AS TIE LEAD ITSELF BOTH THE LEAD AND ITS SULPHURET BEING IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE METALS GENERALLY 1809 1870 1889 THE UTTER IMPROBABILITY OF THIS AS A NATURAL EFFECT AND THE ABSENCE OF ALL EXPERIMENTAL PROOF IN SUPPORT OF IT HAVE BEEN ALREADY STATED 1861 1871 BUT ONE OR TWO ADDITIONAL REASONS AGAINST IT NOW ARISE THE STATE OF THINGS MAY PERHAPS BE MADE CLEARER BY A DIAGRAM OR TWO IN WHICH ASSUMED CONTACT FORCES MAY BE ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF ALL EXPERIMENTAL EXPRESSION WITHOUT INJURY TO THE REASONING LET FIG 4 PLATE III REPRESENT THE ELECTROMOTIVE FORCES OF A CIRCLE OF PLATINUM IRON AND SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM OR PLATINUM NICKEL AND SOLUTION OF SULPHURET CASES IN WHICH THE FORCES ARE ACCORDING TO THE CONTACT THEORY BALANCED 1860 THEN FIG 5 MAY REPRESENT THE CIRCLE OF PLATINUM LEAD AND SOLUTION OF SULPHURET WHICH DOES PRO DUCE A CURRENT AND AS I HAVE ASSUMED WITH A RESULTING FORCE OF 11  THIS IN A FEW MINUTES BECOMES QUIESCENT I E THE CURRENT CEASES AND FIG 6 MNAY REPRESENT THIS NEW CASE ACCORDING TO THE CONTACT THEORY NOW IS IT AT ALL LIKELY THAT BY THE IN TERVENTION OF SULPHURET OF LEAD AT THE CONTACT C FIG 5 AND THE PRODUCTION OF TWO CON TACTS D AND E FIG 6 SUCH AN ENORMOUS CHANGE OF THE CONTACT FORCE SUFFERING ALTERATION SHOULD BE MADE AS FROM 10 TO 21  THE INTERVENTION OF THE SAME SULPHURET EITHER AT A OR B 1834 18400 BEING ABLE TO DO NOTHING OF THE KIND FOR THE SUM OF THE FORCE OF THE TWO NEW CONTACTS IS IN THAT CASE EXACTLY EQUAL TO THE FORCE OF THE CONTACT WHICH THEY REPLACE AS IS PROVED BY SUCH INTERPOSITION MNAKING NO CHANGE IN THE EFFECTS OF THE CIRCLE 1867 1840 IF THEREFORE THE INTERVENTION OF THIS BODY BETWEEN LEAD AND PLA TINUM AT A OR BETWEEN SOLUTION OF SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM AND PLATINUM AT B FIG 5 CAUSES NO CHANGE THESE CASES INCLUDING ITS CONTACT WITH BOTH LEAD AND THE SOLUTION OF SULPHUBRET IS IT AT ALL PROBABLE THAT ITS INTERVENTION BETWEEN THESE TWO BODIES AT C SHOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE EQUAL TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF FORCE PREVIOUSLY EXISTING OR INDEED ANY DIFFERENCE AT ALL 1890 SUCH AN ALTERATION AS THIS IN THE SUM ASSIGNED AS THE AMOUNT OF THE FORCES BELONGING TO THE SULPHUTET OF LEAD BY VIRTUE OF ITS TWO PLACES OF CONTACT IS EQUIVALENT I THINK TO SAYING THAT IT PARTAKES OF THE ANOMALOUS CHARACTER ALREADY SUPPOSED TO BELONG TO CERTAIN FLUIDS NAMELY OF SOMETIMES GIVING BALANCED FORCES IN CIRCLES OF GOOD CONDUCTORS AND AT OTHER TIMES NOT 1865 1891 EVEN THE METALS THEMLSELVES MUST IN FACT BE FORCED INTO THIS CONSTRAINED CONDITION FOR THE EFFECT AT A POINT OF CONTACT IF THERE BE ANY AT ALL MRUST BE THE RE SULT OF THE JOINT AND MUTUAL ACTIONS OF THE BODIES IN CONTACT IF THEREFORE IN THE CIRCUIT FIG 5 THE CONTACT FORCES ARE NOT BALANCED IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF THE DEFICIENT JOINT ACTION OF THE LEAD AND SOLUTION AT C IF THE METAL AND FLUID WERE TO ACT IN THEIR  MY NUMBERS ARE ASSUMED AND IF OTHER NUMBERS WERE TAKEN THE REASONING MIGT BE REMOVED TO CONTACT B OR EVEN TO CONTACT A BUT THE END OF THE ARGUMENT WOULD IN EVERY CASE BE THE SAMESULPIIHURET OF POTASSIUMVOLTAIC CIRCLES PROPER CHARACTER AND AS IRON OR NICKEL WOULD DO IN THE PLACE OF THE LEAD THEN THE FORCE THERE WOULD BE  21 WHEREAS IT IS LESS OR ACCORDING TO THE ASSUMED NUMBERS ONLY 10 NOW AS THERE IS NO REASON WHY THE LEAD SHOULD HAVE ANY SUPERIORITY ASSIGNED TO IT OVER THE SOLUTION SINCE THLE LATTER CAN GIVE A BALANCED CON DITION AMONGST GOOD CONDUCTORS IN ITS PROPER SITUATION AS WELL AS THE FORMER HOW CAN THIS BE UNLESS LEAD POSSESS THAT STRANGE CHARACTER OF SOMETIMES GIVING EQUIPOISED CONTACTS AND AT OTHER TIMES RNOT 1865 1892 IF THAT BE TRUE OF LEAD IT MUST BE TRUE OF ALL THE METALS WHICH WITH THIS SUL PHURETTED ELECTROLYTE GIVE CIRCLES PRODUCING CURRENTS AND THIS WOULD INCLUDE BISMUTH COPPER ANTIMONY SILVER CADMIUM ZINC TIN C C WITH OTHER ELECTROLYTIC FLUIDS IRON AND NICKEL WOULD BE INCLUDED AND EVEN GOLD PLATINUM PALLADIUM IN FACT ALL THE BODIES THAT CAN BE MADE TO YIELD IN ANY WAY ACTIVE VOLTAIC CIRCUITS THEN IS IT POS SIBLE THAT THIS CAN BE TRUE AND YET NOT A SINGLE COMBINATION OF THIS EXTENSIVE CLASS OF BODIES BE PRODUCIBLE THAT CAN GIVE THE CURRENT WITHOUT CHEMICAL ACTION 1867 CON SIDERED NOT AS A RESULT BUT AS A KNOWN AND PREEXISTING FORCE  1893 I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO AVOID FURTHER STATEMENT OF THE ARGUMENTS BUT THINK MY SELF BOUND TO PRODUCE 1799 A SMALL PROPORTION OF THE ENORMOUS BODY OF FACTS WHICH APPEAR TO ME TO BEAR EVIDENCE ALL IN ONE DIRECTION 1894 BISMUTHTHIS METAL WHEN ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM GOLD OR PALLADIUM IN SOLUTION OF THE SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM GIVES ACTIVE CIRCLES THE BISMUTH BEING POSITIVE IN THE COURSE OF LESS THAN HALF AN HOUR THE CURRENT CEASES BUT THE CIRCUIT IS STILL AN EXCELLENT CONDUCTOR OF THERMO CURRENTS BISMULTH WITH IRON OR NICKEL PRODUCES THE SAME FINAL RESULT WITH THE RESERVATION BEFORE MADE 1826 BISMUTH AND LEAD GIVE AN ACTIVE CIRCLE AT FIRST THE BISMUTH IS POSITIVE IN A MINUTE ORL TWO THE CURRENT CEASES BUT THE CIRCUIT STILL CONDUCTS THE THERMO CURRENT WELL 1895 THUS WHILST SULPHURET OF BISMUTH IS IN THE ACT OF FORMATION THE CURRENT IS PRODUCED WHEN THE CHEMICAL ACTION C EASES THE CURRENT CEASES ALSO THOUGH CONTACT CONTINUES AND THE SULPHURET BE A GOOD CONDUCTOR IN THE CASE OF BISMUTH AND LEAD THE CHEMICAL ACTION OCCURS AT BOTH SIDES BUT IS MOST ENERGETIC AT THE BISMUTH AND THE CURRENT IS DETERMINED ACCORDINGLY EVEN IN THAT INSTANCE THE CESSATION OF CHE MICAL ACTION CAUSES THE CESSATION OF THE CURRENT 1896 IN THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH LEAD AND BISMUTH I HAVE GIVEN THEIR ASSOCIATIONS EWITH PLATINUM GOLD PALLADIUM IRON AND NICKEL BECAUSE BELIEVING IN THE FIRST PLACE THAT THE RESULTS PROVE ALL CURRENT TO DEPEND ON CHEMICAL ACTION THEN THE QUIESCENT STATE OF THE RESULTING OR FINAL CIRCLES SHOWS THAT THE CONTACTS OF THESE METALS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE PAIRS ARE WITHOUT FORCE 1829 AND UPON THAT AGAIN FOLLOWS THE PASSIVE CONDITION OF ALL THOSE CONTACTS WHICH CAN BE PRODUCED BY INTERPOSING OTHER CONDUCTING BODIES BETWEEN THEM 1833 AN ARGUMENT THAT NEED NOT AGAIN BE URGED 1897 COPPERTHIS SUBSTANCE BEING ASSOCIATED WITH PLATINUM GOLD IRON OR ANY METAL CHEMICALLY INACTIVE IN THE SOLUTION OF SULPHURET GIVES AN ACTIVE CIRCLE IN WHICH THE COPPER IS POSITIVE THROUGH THE ELECTROLYTE TO THE OTHER IMETAL THE ACTION THOUGH 8788 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL

BE REMOVED BEFORE THE COAT FORNMED IS SO THICK AS TO BREAK UP FROM THE METAL BENEATH AND BE WASHED AND DRIED AND THEN REPLACED IN ASSOCIATION WITH PLATINUM OR IRON IN THE SOLUTION IT WILL AT THE FIRST BE NEUTRAL OR AS IS OFTEN THE CASE NEGATIVE 1827 1838 TO THE OTHER INETAL A RESULT QUITE IN OPPOSITION TO THE IDEA THAT THE MIERE PRESENCE OF THE SULPHURET ON IT COULD HAVE CAUSED THE FORMER POWERFUL CURRENT AND POSITIVE STATE OF THE COPPER 1897 1878 A FURTHER PROOF THAT IT IS NOT THE MERE PRESENCE BUT THEFORMATION OF THE SULPHURET WHICH CAUSES THE CUR RLENT IS THAT IF THE PLATE BE LEFT LONG ENOUGH FOR THLE SOLUTION TO PENETRATE THE INVESTING CRUST OF SULPHURET OF COPPER AND COMNE INTO ACTIVITY ON THE METAL BENEATH THEN THE PLATE BECOMES ACTIVE AND A CURRENT IS PRODUCED 1899 I MADE SOME SULPHURET OF COPPER BY IGNITING THICK COPPER WIRE IN A FLORENCE FLASK OR CRUCIBLE IN ABUNDANCE OF VAPOUR OF SULPHUR THE BODY PRODUCED IS IN AN EXCELLENT FORM FOR THESE EXPERIMENTS AND A GOOD CONDUCTOR BUT IT IS NOT WITHOUT ACTION ON THE SULPHURETTED SOLUTION FROMN WHICH IT CAN TAKE MORE SULPHUR AND THE CONSEQUENCE IS THAT IT IS POSITIVE TO PLATINUM OR IRON IN SUCH A SOLUTION IF SUCH SUL PHURET OF COPPER BE LEFT LONG IN THE SOLUTION AND THEN BE WASHED AND DRIED IT WILL GENERALLY ACQUIRE THE FINAL STATE OF SULPHURATION EITHER IN PARTS OR ALTOGETHER AND ALSO BE INACTIVE AS THE SULPHURET FORMED ON THE COPPER WAS BEFORE 1898 I E WHEN ITS CHEMAICAL ACTION IS EXHAUSTED IT CEASES TO PRODUCE A CURRENT 1900 NATIVE GRAY SULPHURET OF COPPER HAS THE SAME RELATION TO THE ELECTROLYTE IT TAKES SULPHUR FROM IT AND IS RAISED TO A HIGHER STATE OF COMBINATION AND AS IT IS ALSO A CONDUCTOR 1820 IT PRODUCES A CURRENT BEING ITSELF POSITIVE SO LONG AS THE ACTION CONTINUES 1901 BUT WHEN THE COPPER IS FULLY SULPHURETTED THEN ALL THESE ACTIONS CEASE THOUGH THE SULPHURET BE A CONDUCTOR THE CONTACTS STILL RERNAIN AND THE CIRCLE CAN CARRY WITH FACILITY A FEEBLE THERMO CURIRENT THIS IS NOT ONLY SHOWN BY THE QUIESCENT CASES JUST RMENTIONED 1898 BUT ALSO BY THE UTTER INACTIVITY OF PLATINUM AND COMPACT YELLOW COPPER PYRITES WHEN COTLJOINED BY THIS ELECTROLYTE AS SHOWN IN A FORMER PART OF THIS PAPER 1840

IT IS LIKE THE SULPHURET OF TIN 1882 BUT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE DOES NOT STOP THE OCCURRENCE OF THE CHEMICAL CUR RENT FOR AS THE SULPHURET FORMS A POROUS INSTEAD OF A CONTINUOUS CRUST THE ELECTRO LYTE HAS

THE METAL IN THIS RESPECT THEREFORE SILVER AND COPPER ARE ALIKE AND THE ACTION CONSEQUENTLY CONTINUES IN BOTH CASES BUT THEY DIFFER IN THE SULPHURET OF SILVER BEING A NONCONDUCTOR 434 FOR THESE FEEBLE

ADHERENT AND THIS WAS MORE ESPECIALLY THE CASE WHEN PRIOR TO THE EXPERIMENT THE CADMIUM AFTER HAVING BEEN CLEANED WAS BURNISHED BY A GLASS ROD 1881 HENCE IT APPEARS THAT THE SULPHURET OF THIS METAL IS

STIRRING THEM A LITTLE BY WHICH ABUNDANCE OF SULPHURET OF ZINC WILL BE FORMED AND THEN STIRRING THE WHOLE WELL TOGETHER WHEN IT WILL BE REDISSOLVED THE CONSEQUENCE OF THIS SOLUBILITY IS THAT THE ZINC WHEN TAKEN OUT OF THE SOLUTION IS PERFECTLY FREE FIROM MDCCCXL N 8990 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XVI INVESTING SULPHURET OF ZINC HENCE THEREFORE A VERY SUFFICIENT REASON ON THE CHE MICAL THEORY WHY THE ACTION SHOULD GO ON BUT HOW CAN THE THEORY OF CONTACT REFER THE CURRENT TO ANY CONTACT OF THE METALLIC SULPHURET WHEN THAT SULPHURET IS IN THE FIRST PLACE A NONCONDUCTOR AND IN THE NEXT IS DISSOLVED AND CARRIED OFF INTO THE SO LUTION AT THE MOMENT OF ITS FORMATION 1907 THUS ALL THE PHENOMENA WITH THIS ADMIRABLE ELECTROLYTE 1880 WHETHER THEY BE THOSE WHICH ARE RELATED TO IT AS AN ACTIVE 1879 OR AS A PASSIVE 1825 C BODY CONFIRM THE CHEMICAL THEORY AND OPPOSE THAT OF CONTACT WITH TIN AND CADMIUM IT GIVES AN IMPERMEABLE NONCONDUCTING BODY WITH LEAD AND BISMUTH IT GIVES AN IM PERMEABLE CONDUCTING BODY WITH ANTIMONY AND SILVER IT PRODUCES A PERMEABLE NON CONDUCTING BODY WITH COPPER A PERMEABLE CONDUCTING BODY AND WITH ZINC A SOLUBLE NONCONDUCTING BODY THE CHEMICAL ACTION AND ITS RESULTING CURRENT ARE PERFECTLY CONSISTENT WITH ALL THESE VARIATIONS BUT TRY TO EXPLAIN THEM BY THE THEORY OF CON TACT AND AS FAR AS I CAN PERCEIVE THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY TWISTING THE THEORY ABOUT AND MAKING IT STILL MORE TORTUOUS THAN BEFORE 1861 1865 1872 1874 1889  SPECIAL ASSUMPTIONS BEING NECESSARY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS WHICH UNDER IT BECOME SO MANY SPECIAL CASES 1908 SOLUTION OF PROTOSULPHURET OF POTASSIUM OR BIHYDROSULPHURE OF POTASSAI USED A SOLUTION OF THIS KIND AS THE ELECTROLYTE IN A FEW CASES THE RESULTS GENERALLY WERE IN ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE ALREADY GIVEN BUT I DID NOT THINK IT NECESSARY TO PURSUE THEM AT LENGTH THE SOLUTION WAS MADE BY PASSING SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS FOR TWENTYFOURS THROUGH A STRONG SOLUTION OF PURE CAUSTIC POTASSA 1909 IRON AND PLATINUM WITH THIS SOLUTION FORMED A CIRCLE IN WHICH THE IRON WAS FIRST NEGATIVE THEN GRADUALLY BECAME NEUTRAL AND FINALLY ACQUIRED A POSITIVE STATE THE SOLUTION FIRST ACTED AS THE YELLOW SULPHURET IN REDUCING THE INVESTING OXIDE 2049 AND THEN APPARENTLY DIRECTLY ON THE IRON DISSOLVING THE SULPHURET FORMED NICKEL WAS POSITIVE TO PLATINUM FROM THE FIRST AND CONTINUED SO THOUGH PRODUCING ONLY A WEAK CURRENT WHEN WEAK CHEMICAL ACTION WAS SUBSTITUTED FOR METALLIC CONTACT AT X FIG 2 1831 A POWERFUL CURRENT PASSED COPPER WAS HIGHLY POSITIVE TO IRON AND NICKEL AS ALSO TO PLATINUM GOLD AND THE OTHEIR METALS WHICH WERE UNACTED UPON BY THE SOLUTION SILVER WAS POSITIVE TO IRON NICKEL AND EVEN LEAD AS WELL AS TO PLA TINUM GOLD C LEAD IS POSITIVE TO PLATINUM THEN THE CURRENT FALLS BUT DOES NOT CEASE BISMUTH IS ALSO POSITIVE AT FIRST BUT AFTER A WHILE THE CURRENT ALMOST ENTIRELY CEASES AS WITH THE YELLOW SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1894 1910 NATIVE GRAY SULPHURET OF COPPER AND ARTIFICIAL SULPHURET OF COPPER 1899 WERE POSITIVE TO PLATINUM AND THE INACTIVE METALS BUIT YELLOW COPPER PYRITES YELLOW IRON PYRITES AND GALENA WERE INACTIVE WITH THESE METALS IN THIS SOLUTION AS BEFORE THEY HAD BEEN WITH THE SOLUTION OF YELLOW OR BISULPHURET OF POTASSIUM THIS SOLUTION AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM ITS COMPOSITION HAS MORE OF ALKALINE CHARACTERS IN IT THAN THE YELLOW SULPHURET OF POTASSIUM 1911 BEFORE CONCLUDING THIS ACCOUNT OF RESULTS WITH THE SULPHURETTED SOLUTIONS ASSULPHURET OF POTASSIUMVOLTAIC CIRCLES EXCITING ELECTROLYTES I WILL MENTION THE VARYING AND BEAUTIFUL PHENOMENA WHICH OCCUR WHEN COPPER AND SILVERT OR TWO PIECES OF COPPER OR TWO PIECES OF SILVER FORM A CIRCLE WITH THE YELLOW SOLUTION IF THE METALS BE COPPER AND SILVER THE COPPER IS AT FIRST POSITIVE AND THE SILVER REMAINS UNTARNISHLED IN A SHORT TIME THIS ACTION CEASES AND THE SILVER BECOMES POSITIVE AT THE SAME INSTANT IT BEGINS TO COMBINE WITH SULPHUR AND BECOMES COVERED WITH SULPHURET OF SILVER IN THE COURSE OF A FEW NMOMENTS THE COPPER AGAIN BECOMES POSILTIVE AND THUS THE ACTION WILL CHANGE FROM SIDE TO SIDE SEVERAL TIMES AND THE CURRENT WITH IT ACCORDING AS THE CIRCUMSTANCES BECOME IN TURN ILORE FAVOURABLE AT ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER 1912 BUT HOW CAN IT BE ITHOUGHT THAT THE CURRENT FIRST PRODUCED IS DUE IN ANY WAY TO THE CONTACT OF THE SULPHURET OF COPPER FORMED SINCE ITS PRESENCE THERE BECOMES AT LAST THE REASON WHY THAT FIRST CURRENT DIMINISHES AND ENABLES THE SILVER WHICH IS ORI GINALLY THE WEAKER IN EXCITING FORCE AND HAS NO SULPHURET AS YET FORMED ON IT TO ASSUME FOR A TIME THE PRECLORNINANCE AND PRODUCE A CURRENT WHICH CAN OVERCOME THAT EXCITED AT THE COPPER 1911  WHAT CAN ACCOUNT FOR THESE CHANGES BUT CHE MICAL ACTION WHICH AS IT APPEARS TO ME ACCOUNTS AS FAR AS WE HAVE YET GONE WITH THE UTMOST SIMPLICITY FOR ALL THE EFFECTS PRODUCED HOWEVER VARIED THE MODE OF ACTION AND THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY BE ROYAL INSTITUTION DECEMBER 12 1839 91 N 2

ANO THER SHAKE WITH THE SAME NOISE AT SIX OF THE CLOCK IN THE AFORESAID MORNING WHEN WE THOUGHT WE HAD BEEN ALL IN SAFETY CAME ANOTHER SHAKE WITH GREAT FURY AND RUSHING NOISE THE SEA WITH GREAT BELLOWINGS CAME BEYOND ITS BOUNDS THE BELLS RUNG OF THEMSELVES AND THE DESTRUCTION WAS SO GREAT THAT NO BUILDING STOOD THE NOISE WAS SUCH THAT THO SE IN THE FIELDS ASSURE US THAT THE CATTLE WERE IN GREAT ASTO NISHMENT CALLAO CANETE PISCO CHANCAY AND LOS CHORILLOS ARE ALL RUINED THERE ARE MORE THAN 5000 DEAD BODIES FOUND AND THEY FIND MORE DAILY SO THAT WE KNOW NOT THEIR NUMBER NO II THE INHABITANTS OF JAMAICA EXPECT AN EARTHQUAKE EVERY YEAR C SOME OF THEM ARE OF OPINION THAT THEY FOLLOW THEIR GREAT RAINS ONE OF THEM HAPPENED ON SUNDAY THE 19TH OF FEBRUARY 16878 ABOUT EIGHT IN THE MORNING I FOUND IN A CHAMBER ONE STORY HIGH THE CABINETS AND SEVERAL OTHER MOVEABLES ON THE FLOOR TO REEL AS IF PEOPLE HAD RAISED THE FOUNDATIONS OF THE HOUSE I LOOKD OUT AT A WINDOW TO SEE WHAT WAS THE MATTER AND FOUND THAT THE PIGEONS AND OTHER BIRDS IN AN AVIARY HARD BY WERE ON THEIR WINGS IN A GREAT ASTO N NISHMENT82 NISHMENT KEEPING THEMSELVES IN THAT POSTURE NOT KNOWING WHERE TO ALIGHT WHEREFORE CONCLUDING WHAT IT WAS AND THE DANGER IN BEING IN AN HIGH BRICK HOUSE I MADE WHAT HASTE I COULD TO GET OUT BUT BEFORE I HAD PASSED THROUGH TWO ROOMS AND GOT TO THE STAIRCASE IT WAS OVER IT CAME BY SHOCKS THERE WERE THREE OF THEM WITH A LITTLE PAUSE BETWEEN IT LASTED ABOUT A MINUTE OF TIME IN ALL AND THERE WAS A SMALL NOISE AC COMPANIED IT A PAIR OF STAIRS HIGHER IT THREW DOWN MOST THINGS OFF THE SHELVES AND HAD MUCH MORE VI SIBLE EFFECTS THAN BELOW THIS WAS GENERALLY FELT ALL OVER THE ISLAND AT THE SAME TIME OR NEAR IT SOME HOUSES THEREIN BEING CRACKD AND VERY NEAR RUIND OTHERS BEING UNCOVERED OF THEIR TILES VERY FEW ESCAPED SOME INJURY AND THE PEOPLE IN THEM WERE GENERALLY IN A GREAT CONSTERNATION SEEING THEM DANCE THE SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR AT PORTROYAL FELT IT AND ONE WHO WAS EAST WARD OF THE ISLAND COMING THITHER THEN FROM EUROPE MET WITH AS HE SAID AT THE SAME TIME AN HURRICANE ONE RIDING ON HORSEBACK WAS NOT SENSIBLE OF IT A GENTLE MAN BEING AT THAT TIME ABROAD IN HIS PLANTATION TOLD ME HE SAW THE GROUND RISE LIKE THE SEA IN A WAVE AS THE EARTHQUAKE PASSED ALONG AND THAT IT WENT NORTHWARD FOR THAT SOME SMALL TIME AFTER HE HAD FELT IT HE SAW BY THE MOTION OF THE TOPS OF THE TREES ON HILLS SOME MILES DISTANT THAT IT HAD THEN REACHD NO FURTHER THAN THAT PLACE THE SPANIARDS WHO INHABITED THIS ISLAND AND THOSE NEIGHBOURING BUILT THEIR HOUSES VERY LOW AND THEY CONSISTED ONLY OF GROUNDROOMS THEIR WALLS BE ING MADE OF POSTS WHICH WERE AS MUCH BURIED UNDER GROUND AS THEY STOOD ABOVE ON PURPOSE TO AVOID THE DANGER WHICH ATTENDED OTHER MANNER OF BUILDING FROM EARTHQUAKES AND I HAVE SEEN IN THE MOUNTAINS AFAR OFF BARE SPOTS WHICH THE INHABITANTS TOLD ME WERE THE EFFECTS OF EARTHQUAKES THROWING DOWN PART OF THE HILLS WHICH CONTINUED BARE AND STEEP JAMAICA83 NO III JAMAICA JUNE 20 1692  THE TERRIBLE EARTHQUAKE WHICH HAPPEND THE 7TH INSTANT BETWEEN ELEVEN AND TWELVE OF THE CLOCK AT NOON SHOOK DOWN AND DROWNED NINE TENTHS OF THE TOWN OF PORTROYAL IN TWO

HER MISTRESS WAS IN HER CLOSET TWO PAIR OF STAIRS HIGH AND SHE WAS SENT INTO THE GARRET WHERE WAS MRS B AND HER DAUGHTER WHEN SHE FELT THE EARTHQUAKE AND BID HER TAKE UP HER CHILD AND RUN DOWN BUT TURNING ABOUT MET THE WATER AT THE TOP OF THE GARRET STAIRS FOR THE HOUSE SUNK DOWN RIGHT AND IS NOW NEAR 30 FOOT UNDER WATER MY SON AND I WENT THAT MORNING TO LIGUANIA THE EARTHQUAKE TOOK US IN THE MIDWAY BETWEEN THAT AND PORTROYAL WHERE WE WERE NEAR BEING OVERWHELMED BY A SWIFT ROWLING SEA SIX FOOT ABOVE THE SURFACE WITHOUT ANY WIND BUT IT PLEASED GOD TO SAVE US BEING FORCED BACK TO LIGUANIA WHERE I FOUND ALL HOUSES EVEN WITH THE GROUND NOT A PLACE TO PUT ONES HEAD IN BUT IN NEGRO HOUSES THE EARTH CONTINUES TO SHAKE FIVE OR SIX TIMES IN 24 HOURS AND OFTEN TREMBLING GREAT PART OF THE MOUN TAINS FELL DOWN AND FALL DAILY I PRAY GOD DIVERT THOSE HEAVY JUDGMENTS WHICH STILL THREATEN US NO IV WE HAVE HAD A VERY GREAT MORTALITY SINCE THE GREAT EARTHQUAKE FOR WE HAVE LITTLE ONES DAILY ALMOST HALF THE PEOPLE THAT ESCAPD UPON PORTROYAL ARE SINCE DEAD OF A MALIGNANT FEVER FROM CHANGE OF AIR WANT OF DRY HOUSES WARM LODGING PROPER MEDICINES AND OTHER CONVENIENCIES N 2 JAMAICA84 NO V JAMAICA SEPT 20 1692 I DOUBT NOT BUT YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE THIS OF OUR GREAT CALAMITY BUT HOWEVER I WILL GIVE YOU THE PARTICULARS AS NEAR AS I CAN IN THE FIRST PLACE GREAT PART OF PORT ROYAL IS SUNK THAT WHERE THE WHARSS WAS IS NOW SOME FATHOMS OF WATER ALL THE STREET WHERE THE CHURCH STOOD IS OVERSLOWD THAT THE WATER STANDS SO HIGH AS THE UPPER ROOMS OF THOSE WHICH ARE STANDING THE EARTH WHEN IT OPENED AND SWALLOWED UP PEOPLE THEY ROSE IN OTHER STREETS SOME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE HARBOUR AND YET SAVED THOUGH AT THE SAME TIME I BELIEVE THERE WAS LOST ABOUT 2000 WHITES AND BLACKS AT THE NORTH ABOUT 1000 ACRES OF LAND SUNK AND THIRTEEN PEOPLE WITH IT ALL OUR HOUSES THROWN DOWN ALL OVER THE ISLAND THAT WE WERE FORCED TO LIVE IN HUTTS THE TWO GREAT MOUNTAINS AT THE ENTRING INTO SIXTEEN MILE WALK FELL AND MET AND STOPT THE RIVER THAT IT WAS DRY FROM THAT PLACE TO THE FERRY FOR A WHOLE DAY AND VAST QUANTITIES OF FISH TAKEN UP WHICH WAS GREATLY TO THE RELIEF OF THE DISTRESSED AT YELLOWS A GREAT MOUN TAIN SPLIT AND FELL INTO THE LEVEL LAND AND COVERED SE VERAL SETTLEMENTS AND DESTROYD NINETEEN WHITE PEOPLE ONE OF THE PERSONS WHOSE NAME WAS HOPKINS HAD HIS PLANTATION REMOVD HALF A MILE FROM THE PLACE IT FOR MERLY STOOD AND NOW GOOD PROVISIONS GROWING UPON IT OF ALL WELLS FROM A FATHOM TO SIX OR SEVENTHE WATER FLEW OUT AT THE TOP WITH THE GREAT MOTION OF THE EARTH SINCE IT HAS CONTINUED SHAKING SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE TIMES IN A DAY SO AT NIGHT SOMETIMES MORE SOMETIMES LESS BUT GOD BE PRAISED THEY ARE BUT SMALL OUR PEO PLE SETTLED A TOWN AT LEGUANEA SIDE AND THERE IS ABOUT 500 GRAVES ALREADY AND PEOPLE EVERY DAY A DYING STILL I WENT ABOUT ONCE TO SEE IT AND I HAD LIKE TO HAVE TIPT OFF POOR CAPT WATSON WAS DROWND ALL THIS I DO AS SURE85 SURE YOU IS TRUTH AND IF I HAD TIME COULD GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF A GREAT MANY MORE OF THE LIKE NO VI WHAT YOU DESIRE CONCERNING OUR EARTHQUAKE IN JA MAICA I WILL ANSWER AS NEAR AS I CAN TO WHAT I SAW AND HEARD PORTROYAL BEING THE PLACE WHERE I LIVED I SHALL BEGIN WITH WHAT I MET WITH THERE ON TUESDAY THE 7TH OF JUNE 1692 BETWIXT ELEVEN AND TWELVE AT NOON I BEING AT A TAVERN WE FELT THE HOUSE SNAKE AND SAW THE BRICKS BEGIN TO RISE IN THE FLOOR AND AT THE SAME INSTANT HEARD ONE IN THE STREET CRY AN EARTHQUAKE IMMEDIATELY WE RUN OUT OF THE HOUSE WHERE WE SAW ALL PEOPLE WITH LIFT ED UP HANDS BEGGING GODS ASSISTANCE WE CONTINUED RUNNING UP THE STREET WHILST ON EITHER SIDE US WE SAW THE HOUSES SOME SWALLOWED UP OTHERS THROWN ON HEAPS THE SAND IN THE STREET RISE LIKE THE WAVES OF THE SEA LIFTING UP ALL PERSONS THAT STOOD UPON IT AND IM MEDIATELY DROPPING DOWN INTO PITS AND AT THE SAME INSTANT A FLOOD OF WATER BREAKING IN AND ROWLING THOSE POOR SOULS OVER AND OVER SOME CATCHING HOLD OF BEAMS AND RAFTERS OF HOUSESOTHERS WERE FOUND IN THE SAND THAT APPEARED WHEN THE WATER WAS DRAIND AWAY WITH THEIR LEGS AND ARMS OUT WE BEHOLDING THIS DISMAL SIGHT THE SMALL PIECE OF GROUND WHEREON SIXTEEN OR EIGHTEEN OF US STOOD PRAISED BE GOD DID NOT SINK AS SOON AS THE VIOLENT SHAKE WAS OVER EVERY MAN WAS DESIROUS TO KNOW IF ANY PART OF HIS FAMILY WERE LEFT ALIVE I EN DEAVOURED TO GO TOWARDS MY HOUSE UPON THE RUINES OF THE HOUSES THAT WERE FLOATING UPON THE WATER BUT COULD NOT AT LENGTH I GOT A CANOA AND ROWD UP THE GREAT SEA SIDE TOWARDS MY HOUSE WHERE I SAW SEVERAL MEN AND WOMEN FLOATING UPON THE WRECK OUT OF SEA AND AS MANY OF THEM AS I COULD I TOOK INTO THE BOAT AND STILL ROWD ON TILL I CAME WHERE I THOUGHT MY HOUSE HAD STOOD BUT COULD NOT HEAR OF NEITHER MY WIFE NOR FAMILY SO RETURNED AGAIN TO THAT LITTLE PART REMAINING ABOVE WATER BUT86 BUT SEEING ALL PEOPLE ENDEAVOURING TO GET TO THE ISLAND I WENT AMONGST THEM IN HOPES I MIGHT HEAR OF MY WIFE OR SOME PART OF MY FAMILY BUT COULD NOT NEXT MORNING I WENT FROM ONE SHIP TO ANOTHER TILL AT LENGTH IT PLEASED GOD THAT I MET WITH MY WIFE AND TWO OF MY NEGROES I THEN ASKED HER HOW SHE ESCAPED SHE TOLD ME WHEN SHE FELT THE HOUSE SHAKE SHE RUN OUT AND CALLD ALL WITHIN TO DO THE SAME SHE WAS NO SOONER OUT BUT THE SAND LIFTED UP AND HER NEGRO WOMAN GRASPING ABOUT HER THEY BOTH DROPT INTO THE EARTH TOGETHER AND AT THE SAME INSTANT THE WATER COMING IN ROWLD THEM OVER AND OVER TILL AT LENGTH THEY CATCHD HOLD OF A BEAM WHERE THEY HUNG TILL A BOAT CAME FROM A SPANISH VESSEL AND TOOK THEM UP THE HOUSES FROM THE JEWS STREET END TO THE BREAST WORK WERE ALL SHAKD DOWN SAVE ONLY EIGHT OR TEN THAT REMAINED FROM THE BALCONY UPWARDS ABOVE WATER AND AS SOON AS THE VIOLENT EARTHQUAKE WAS OVER THE WATER MEN AND SAILERS DID NOT STICK TO PLUNDER THOSE HOUSES AND IN THE TIME OF THEIR PLUNDER ONE OR TWO OF THEM FELL UPON THEIR HEADS BY A SECOND EARTHQUAKE WHERE THEY WERE LOST AS SOON AS THE VIOLENT SHAKE WAS OVER THE MINISTER DESIRED ALL PEOPLE TO JOIN WITH HIM IN PRAYER AND AMONGST THEM WERE SEVERAL JEWS THAT KNEELED AND AN SWERED AS THEY DID NAY I HEARD ONE SAY THEY WERE HEARD TO CALL UPON JESUS CHRIST A THING WORTH OBSER VATION SEVERAL SHIPS AND SLOOPS WERE OVERSET AND LOST IN THE HARBOUR AMONGST THE REST THE SWANFRIGAT THAT LAY BY THE WHARS TO CAREEN BY THE VIOLENT MOTION OF THE SEA AND SINKING OF THE WHARF WAS FORCED OVER THE TOPS OF MANY HOUSES AND PASSING BY THAT HOUSE WHERE MY LORD PUKE LIVED PART OF IT FELL UPON HER AND BEAT IN HER ROUND HOUSE SHE DID NOT OVERSET BUT HELPT SOME HUNDREDS IN SAVING THEIR LIVES AS87 AS TO THE FIREBALLS WHICH YOU HEARD WAS SEEN IN THE AIRIT WAS A GREAT FALSHOOD FOR I NEITHER SAW NOR HEARD DURING OUR MONTHS STAY AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE ANY SUCH THING BUT A GREAT AND HIDEOUS RUMBLING WAS HEARD IN THE MOUNTAINS INSOMUCH THAT IT FRIGHTED MANY NE GROES THAT HAD BEEN RUN AWAY SOME MONTHS FROM THEIR MASTERS AND MADE THEM COME HOME AND PROMISE NOT TO RUN AWAY ANY MORE THE WATER THAT ISSUED FROM THE SALTPANNS HILLS I SAW MY SELF AS ALSO MR ASHBORNE AND ONE PINNOCK A QUAKER OF LEGUANEE IT FORCED ITS PASSAGE OUT FROM THE HILL IN I BELIEVE TWENTY OR THIRTY SEVERAL PLACES SOME MORE FORCIBLY THAN OTHERS FOR IN EIGHT OR TEN PLACES IT CAME WITH THAT VIOLENCE THAT HAD SO MANY SLUCES BEEN DRAWN UP AT ONCE THEY COULD NOT HAVE RUN WITH GREATER FORCE AND MOST OF THEM SIX OR SEVEN YARDS HIGH FROM THE FOOT OF THE HILL THREE OR FOUR OF THE LEAST OF THEM WE OB SERVED WERE NEAR TEN OR TWELVE YARDS HIGH IN THE MOUN TAIN WE STOOD SOME TIME IN LOOKING ON THIS MIRACU LOUS SIGHT AT LENGTH WE TASTED THE WATER IN MOST OF THE PLACES ALL WHICH WE TASTED WE FOUND TO BE BRACKISH OF WHICH WE COULD NOT IMAGINE THE REASON NOR FROM WHENCE THE WATER SHOULD ARISE IT CONTINUED RUNNING THAT AF TERNOON ALL NIGHT TILL NEXT MORNING ABOUT SUNRISE AT WHICH TIME THE SALTPANNS WERE QUITE OVERFLOWD THERE FORE YOU MAY JUDGE ITS FORCE IN RUNNING FOR BOTH SALT PANNS AND MOUNTAIN YOU KNOW VERY WELL THE MOUNTAINS BETWIXT SPANISH TOWN AND SIXTEEN MILEWALK AS THE WAY LIES ALONG THE RIVER IF YOU RE MEMBER ABOUT THE MIDWAY THEY ARE ALMOST PERPENDI CULAR ESPECIALLY ON THE OTHER SIDE THE RIVER THOSE TWO MOUNTAINS IN THE VIOLENT SHAKE OF THE EARTHQUAKE JOINED TOGETHER WHICH STOPT THE PASSAGE OF THE RIVER AND FOR CED IT TO SEEK ANOTHER WHICH WAS A GREAT WAY IN AND OUT AMONGST THE WOODS AND SAVANAS FOR IT WAS NINE DAYS BEFORE THE TOWN HAD ANY RELIEF FROM IT INFO MUCH88 MUCH THAT BEFORE IT CAME THE PEOPLE WERE IN THOUGHTS OF REMOVING INTO THE COUNTRY CONCLUDING IT HAD BEEN SUNK AS PORTROYAL WAS THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE RIVER ARE SO THROWN ON HEAPS THAT ALL PEOPLE ARE FORCED TO GO BY GUANABOA TO SIXTEENMILEWALK THE TIME WE CONTINUED ON THE ISLAND AFTER THE EARTH QUAKE WAS AT MR BOSBYS WHO HAD AS MIRACULOUS AN ESCAPE AND HIS WIFE AS MY WIFE HAD HE LIKEWISE TOLD US THAT THAT AFTERNOON COMING TO HIS PLANTATION HE FOUND THE GROUND OPENED IN SEVERAL PLACES AND IN ONE TWO COWS WERE DROPT IN AND SMOTHERED THE WEATHER WAS MUCH HOTTER AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE THAN BEFORE AND SUCH AN INNUMERABLE QUANTITY OF MUS KETOES THAT THE LIKE WAS NEVER SEEN SINCE THE INHABITING OF THE ISLAND THE MOUNTAINS AT GALLOES FARD NO BETTER THAN THOSE OF SIXTEENMILEWALK A GREAT PART OF ONE OF THEM FALLING DOWN DROVE ALL THE TREES BEFORE IT AND AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAIN THERE WAS A PLANTATION THAT WAS WHOLLY OVERTHROWN AND BURIED IN IT I CANNOT REMEMBER ANY THING MORE AT PRESENT THAT MAY BE MATERIAL NO VII DEENE MARCH 22 16923 AS TO THE MOUNTAINS IN LEGUANEE THEY FELL IN SEVERAL PLACES AND IN SOME VERY STEEP BUT THE STEEPEST MOUN TAIN THAT WE HEARD FALL WAS THAT AT GALLOWES WHICH I HEARD DID MUCH DAMAGE BY ITS ROWLING DOWN THE WATER IN THE STREETS OF PORTROYAL DID NOT SPOUT UP AS YOU HAVE HEARD BUT IN THE VIOLENT SHAKE THE SAND CRACKING AND OPENING IN SEVERAL PLACES WHERE PEO PLE STOOD THEY SINKING INTO IT THE WATER BOILED OUT OF THE SAND THAT COVERD MANY AND SAVED OTHERS AS89 AS TO WHAT I WRIT CONCERNING THE RIVER AND TOWN I DID NOT SEE MY SELF BUT HEARD BY SEVERAL HANDS THAT IT WAS EIGHT OR NINE DAYS BEFORE THE RIVER CAME DOWN SO FAR AS THE TOWN NO VIII PORTROYAL IN JAMAICA JULY 3 1693 THE YEAR 1692 BEGAN IN JAMAICA WITH VERY DRY AND HOT WEATHER WHICH CONTINUED TILL MAY WHEN THERE WAS VERY BLOWING WEATHER AND MUCH RAIN TO THE END OF THE MONTH FROM WHICH TIME TILL THE TIME THE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENED TWAS EXCESSIVE HOT CALM AND DRY AND ON TUESDAY THE 7TH OF JUNE ABOUT 40 MI NUTES PAST ELEVEN IN THE FORENOON IT BEING THEN A VERY HOT CLEAR SUNSHINE DAY SCARCE A CLOUD TO BE SEEN IN THE SKY OR A BREATH OF AIR TO BE FELT HAPNED THAT GREAT SHAKE SO FATAL TO THIS PLACE AND TO THE WHOLE ISLAND WHICH FOR ITS VIOLENCE AND STRANGE EFFECTS MAY PER HAPS BE COMPARED WITH THE GREATEST THAT EVER YET HAP PENED IN THE WORLD AND MAY AS WELL DESERVE THE ME MORY OF FUTURE AGES IT BEGAN WITH A SMALL TREMBLING SO AS TO MAKE PEO PLE THINK THERE WAS AN EARTHQUAKE WHICH THOUGHTS WERE IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMD BY A SECOND SHAKE SOME THING STRONGER ACCOMPANIED ALL THE WHILE WITH A HOLLOW RUMBLING NOISE ALMOST LIKE THAT OF THUNDER WHICH MADE THEM BEGIN TO RUN OUT OF THEIR HOUSES BUT ALAS THIS WAS BUT SHORT WARNING FOR THEM TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR SAFETY FOR AT THE HEELS OF THIS SECOND CAME THE THIRD VIOLENT SHAKE WHICH IN LESS THAN A MINUTES TIME IT CONTINUING NEAR A MINUTE SHOOK THE VERY FOUNDATION OF PORTROYAL IN SUCH SORT THAT AT LEAST TWO PARTS IN THREE I BELIEVE I MAY SAFELY SAY THREE PARTS IN FOUROF THE HOUSES AND THE GROUND WHEREON THEY STOOD AND MOST PART OF THOSE WHO INHABITED THEM ALL SUNK AT ONCE QUITE UNDER INFERREDWATERINFERRED AND ON THE PLACE WHICH WAS LEFT AND IS NOW O STANDING90 STANDING SHOOK DOWN AND SHATTERD THE HOUSES IN SO VIOLENT A MANNER THAT AT OUR LANDING IT LOOKD MORE LIKE A HEAP OF RUBBISH THAN ANY THING ELSE THERE BEING I BELIEVE SCARCE ONE HOUSE IN TEN LEFT STANDING AND THOSE SO CRACKT AND SHATTERD THAT BUT FEW OF THEM WERE SIT OR THOUGHT SAFE TO LIVE IN AND STAND NOW EMPTY ALL THOSE STREETS WHICH WERE NEXT THE WATER TOWARDS THE HARBOURSIDE WHERE THERE WERE EXCELLENT WHARFS CLOSE TO WHICH SHIPS OF 700 TUNN MIGHT LIE AND DELIVER THEIR LOADING WHERE WERE THE BEST STOREHOUSES AND CONVENIENCES FOR MERCHANTS WHERE WERE BRAVE STATELY BUILDINGS WHERE THE CHIEF MEN OF THE PLACE LIVD AND WHICH WERE IN ALL RESPECTS THE PRINCIPAL PARTS OF PORT ROYAL NOW LIE IN FOUR SIX OR EIGHT FATHOM WATER THAT PART WHICH IS NOW STANDING IS PART OF THE END OF THAT NECK OF LAND WHICH RUNS INTO THE SEA AND MAKES THIS HARBOUR AT THE EXTREMITY OF WHICH STANDS THE FORT NOT SHOOK DOWN BUT MUCH SHATTERD BY THE EARTHQUAKE AND IS NOW A PERFECT ISLAND THE WHOLE NECK OF LAND FROM THE PORT OF PORTROYAL NOW STAND ING TO THE PALLISADOES OR OTHER END OF PORTROYAL TO WARDS THE LAND WHICH IS ABOVE A QUARTER OF A MILE BEING QUITE DISCONTINUED AND LOST IN THE EARTHQUAKE AND IS NOW ALSO WITH ALL THE HOUSES THAT STOOD VERY THICK THEREON QUITE UNDER WATER ALL WHICH PART OR NECK OF LAND IS DISCONTINUED AS ALSO ALL THE OTHER PARTS OF THIS PLACE WHICH SUNK WERE FOR WHAT I CAN LEARN NOTHING BUT PERFECT SAND AND BY PEOPLE DRIVING DOWN TIMBER AND WHARFING C WERE BY LITTLE AND LITTLE GAINED IN TIME OUT OF THE SEA WHICH NOW HAS AT ONCE RECOVERED ALL AGAIN WHEREBY WE MAY SEE HOW DANGEROUS IT IS TO CONTEND WITH A POWERFUL ENEMY I HAVE TALKT WITH A FEW MEN THAT CAME HITHER WITH VENABLES WHEN HE CONQUERED THIS PLACE FOR CROMWEL AND PARTICULARLY WITH ONE CAPT HALS FOR WHOM I HAP PENED TO HAVE A LETTER FROM LONDON WHO ALL SAY THAT WHEN91 WHEN THEY CAME HERE THE PLACE WHEREON PORTROYAL WAS SINCE BUILT WAS LIKE ONE OF THE KEYS OR LITTLE ISLANDS THAT LIE OFF THIS HARBOUR WHICH BY THE WAY ARE ALL STANDING BUT CONTINUED BY A SMALL RIDGE OF SAND WHICH THEN JUST APPEARED ABOVE WATER WITH THE LAND I MEAN THE OTHER PART OF THE NECK OF LAND AND BELIEVE THERE IS NOW AS MUCH GROUND LEFT STANDING AS THEN BUT THIS ALL PEOPLE KNOW THAT THE PART OF LAND WHEREON PORTROYAL WAS BUILT WAS ALWAYS ENCREASING SINCE FIRST INHABITED BUT CAPTHALS GOES FURTHER TELLING ME THAT ONE WHOM HE KNEW VERY WELL THAT CAME HERE WITH THEM UNDER VENABLES AND WHO HAD BEEN HERE SOME YEARS BEFORE UN DER ONE JACKSON WHO TOOK AND PLUNDERD ST JAGO C HE VERY WELL REMEMBERS AT HIS COMING HITHER TOLD HIM THAT THE POINT OR PLACE NOW STANDING WHEN HE WAS HERE BEFORE UNDER THE SAID JACKSON WAS WHOLLY SE PARATED FROM LAND BY THE SEA AS IT IS AT THIS TIME AND POINTING TO THE RIDGE OF SAND ABOVEMENTIONED SAID THAT DID NOT APPEAR WHEN I WAS HERE BEFORE AND IT IS COMMONLY SAID BY PEOPLE HERE THAT SHIPS HAVE FORMERLY SAILED OVER THAT PART OF THE NECK OF LAND NOW SUNK UNDER WATER THO WHAT GROUNDS THEY HAVE FOR THAT SAYING WHICH IS COMMON I COULD NEVER LEARN INDEED TIS VERY PROBABLE FOR ALREADY SINCE THE EARTH QUAKE THE SANDY GROUND AT THE PALLISADOES OR OTHER SIDE HATH GAINED FROM THE SEA SEVERAL ACRES ON THIS SANDY NECK OF LAND DID PEOPLE BUILD GREAT HEAVY BRICK HOUSES WHOSE WEIGHT ON SO SANDY A FOUNDATION MAY BE SUPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE MUCH TO THEIR DOWNFALL FOR THE GROUND GAVE WAY AS FAR AS THE HOUSES STOOD ONLY AND NO FURTHER PART OF THE FORT AND PALLISADOES AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSES STANDING THIS PART OF PORTROYAL WHICH IS NOW STANDING IS SAID TO STAND UPON A ROCK BUT ALAS THE STRANGE RENTS AND TEARINGS OF THE MOUNTAINS HERE SUFFICIENTLY EVINCE THAT ROCKS AND SAND ARE EQUALLY ABLE TO WITHSTAND THE FORCE O 2 OF92 OF A VIOLENT EARTHQUAKE IF THIS PLACE BE NOTHING BUT SAND AS SOME WOULD HAVE IT THAT ARE ITS NO WELL WISHERS IT SEEMS STRANGE THAT THE FORCE OF THE EARTH QUAKE DID NOT DISSIPATE AND DISSOLVE THE VERY FOUNDATION OF  AND THAT IT DID NOT FALL TO PIECES AND SCATTER UNDER WATER AS THE REST OF THE PLACE DID FOR THE SHAKE WAS SO VIOLENT THAT IT THREW PEOPLE DOWN ON THEIR KNEES AND SOMETIMES ON THEIR FACES AS THEY RUN ALONG THE STREETS TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR SAFETY AND IT WAS A VERY DIFFICULT MATTER TO KEEP ONES LEGS THE GROUND HEAVED AND SWELLED LIKE A ROLLING SWELLING SEA TIS A STRANGE COMPARISON BUT EVERY BODY HERE USING IT I VENTURE TO DO SO LIKEWISE BY WHICH MEANS SEVERAL HOUSES NOW STANDING WERE SHUFFLED AND MOVED SOME YARDS FROM THEIR PLACES ONE WHOLE STREET A GREAT MANY HOUSES WHEREOF ARE NOW ALSO STANDING IS SAID TO BE TWICE AS BROAD NOW AS BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE AND IN MANY PLA CES THE GROUND WOULD CRACKLE AND OPEN AND SHUT QUICK AND FAST OF WHICH SMALL OPENINGS I HAVE HEARD MAJOR KELLY AND OTHERS SAY THEY HAVE SEEN TWO OR THREE HUN DRED AT ONE TIME IN SOME WHEREOF MANY PEOPLE WERE SWALLOWED UP SOME THE EARTH CAUGHT BY THE MIDDLE AND SQUEEZED TO DEATH THE HEADS OF OTHERS ONLY APPEA RED ABOVE GROUND SOME WERE SWALLOWED QUITE DOWN AND CAST UP AGAIN BY GREAT QUANTITIES OF WATER OTHERS WENT DOWN AND WERE NEVER MORE SEEN THESE WERE THE SMALLEST OPENINGS OTHERS THAT WERE MORE LARGE SWAL LOWED UP GREAT HOUSES AND OUT OF SOME INFERREDGAPINGSINFERRED WOULD ISSUE WHOLE RIVERS OF WATER SPOUTED UP A GREAT HEIGHT INTO THE AIR WHICH SEEMED TO THREATEN A DELUGE TO THAT PART OF PORTROYAL WHICH THE EARTHQUAKE SEEMED TO FA VOUR ACCOMPANIED WITH ILL STENCHES AND OSSENSIVE SMELLS BY MEANS OF WHICH OPENINGS AND THE VAPOURS AT THAT TIME BELCHT FORTH FROM THE EARTH INTO THE AIR THE SKY WHICH BEFORE WAS CLEAR AND BLUE WAS IN A MINUTES TIME BECOME DULL AND REDDISH LOOKING AS I HAVE HEARD IT COMPARED93 COMPARED OFTEN LIKE A RED HOT OVEN ALL THESE DREAD FUL CIRCUMSTANCES OCCURRING AT ONCE ACCOMPANIED ALL THE WHITE WITH PRODIGIOUS LOUD NOISES FROM THE MOUNTAINS OCCASIONED BY THEIR FALLING C AND ALSO A HOLLOW NOISE UNDER GROUND AND PEOPLE RUNNING FROM ONE PLACE TO ANOTHER DISTRACTED WITH FEAR LOOKING LIKE SO MANY GHOSTS AND MORE RESEMBLING THE DEAD THAN THE LIVING MADE THE WHOLE SO TERRIBLE THAT PEOPLE THOUGHT THE DE SOLUTION OF THE WHOLE FRAME OF THE WORLD WAS AT HAND INDEED TIS ENOUGH TO RAISE MELANCHOLY THOUGHTS IN A MAN NOW TO SEE THE CHIMNEYS AND TOPS OF SOME HOU SES AND THE MASTS OF SHIPS AND SLOOPS WHICH PARTAKD OF THE SAME FATE APPEAR ABOVE WATER AND WHEN ONE FIRST COMES ASHORE TO SEE SO MANY HEAPS OF  MA NY WHEREOF BY THEIR LARGENESS SHEW THAT ONCE THERE HAD STOOD A BRAVE INFERREDHOUSEINFERRED TO SEE SO MANY HOUSES SHATTERD SOME HALF FALLEN DOWN THE REST DESOLATE AND WITHOUT IN HABITANTS TO SEE WHERE HOUSES HAVE BEEN SWALLOWED UP SOME APPEARING HALF ABOVE GROUND AND OF OTHERS THE CHIMNEYS ONLY BUT ABOVE ALLTO STAND ON THE SEASHORE AND TO LOOK OVER THAT PART OF THE NECK OF LAND WHICH FOR ABOVE A  OF A MILE WAS QUITE SWALLOWD UP THERE WHERE ONCE BRAVE STREETS OF STATELY HOUSES STOOD APPEARING NOW NOTHING BUT WATER EXCEPT HERE AND THERE A CHIMNEY AND SOME PARTS AND PIECES OF HOUSES SER VING ONLY TO MIND US OF THEIR SAD MISFORTUNE NOW HA BITATIONS FOR FISH CONTRARY TO THE INTENT OF THE FIRST BUILDERS AND THO PORTROYAL WAS SO GREAT A SUFFERER BY THE EARTHQUAKE YET IT LEFT MORE HOUSES STANDING THERE THAN IN ALL THE ISLAND BESIDES ALL OVER WHICH TIS SAID TO RAGE MORE FURIOUSLY THAN AT PORTROYAL AND THIS SEEMS TO BE TRUE FOR IT WAS SO VIOLENT IN OTHER PLACES THAT PEOPLE COULD NOT KEEP THEIR LEGS BUT WERE VIOLENTLY THROWN DOWN ON THE GROUND WHERE THEY LAY ON THEIR FACES WITH THEIR ARMS AND LEGS SPREAD OUT TO PREVENT BEING TUMBLED94 TUMBLED AND THROWN ABOUT BY THE ALMOST INCREDIBLE MO TION OF THE EARTH LIKE THAT AS IS THE GENERAL COMPARISON OF A GREAT SEA IT SCARCE LEFT A PLANTERS HOUSE OR SUGARWORK STANDING ALL OVER THE ISLAND I THINK IT LEFT NOT A HOUSE STANDING AT PASSAGEFORT AND BUT ONE IN ALL LIGANEE AND NONE IN ST JAGO EXCEPT A FEW LOW HOUSES BUILT BY THE WARY SPANIARDS AND TIS NOT TO BE DOUBTED BUT THAT HAD THERE BEEN 500 OR 5000 TOWNS IN JAMAICA THE EARTH QUAKE WOULD HAVE RUINED EVERY ONE IN SEVERAL PLACES IN THE COUNTRY THE EARTH GAPED PRODIGIOUSLY ON THE NORTHSIDE THE PLANTERS HOUSES WITH GREATEST PART OF THEIR PLANTATIONS AND THE PLANTERS HOUSES LIE NOT VERY NEAR TO ONE ANOTHER WERE SWALLOWED HOUSES PEOPLE TREES ALL UP IN ONE GAPE INSTEAD OF WHICH APPEARED FOR SOME TIME AFTER A GREAT POOL OR LAKE OF WATER CO VERING ABOVE A THOUSAND ACRES WHICH IS SINCE DRYED UP AND NOW IS NOTHING BUT A LOOSE SAND OR GRAVEL WITHOUT ANY THE LEAST MARK OR SIGN LEFT WHEREBY ONE MAY JUDGE THAT THERE EVER HAD STOOD A TREE HOUSE OR ANY THING ELSE IN CLARENDON PRECINCT THE EARTH GAPED AND SPOUTED UP WITH A PRODIGIOUS FORCE GREAT QUANTITIES OF WATER INTO THE AIR ABOVE TWELVE MILES FROM THE SEA AND ALL OVER THE ISLAND THERE WERE ABUNDANCE OF GAPINGS OR OPENINGS OF THE EARTH MANY THOUSANDS MARKS OF MANY WHEREOF WHICH UPON THEIR CLOSING THEY LEFT BEHIND THEM ANY ONE CANNOT CHUSE BUT SEE THAT GOES INTO THE COUNTRY AND I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL BUT IN THE MOUNTAINS SAID SAID TO BE THE MOST VIOLENT SHAKES OF ALL AND TIS A GENERALLY RECEIVD OPINION THAT THE NEAR ER TO THE MOUNTAINS THE GREATER THE SHAKE AND THAT THE CAUSE THEREOF WHATEVER IT IS LIES THERE INDEED THEY ARE STRANGELY TORN AND RENT INSOMUCH THAT THEY SEEM TO BE OF QUITE DIFFERENT SHAPES NOW FROM WHAT THEY WERE ESPECIALLY THE BLEW AND OTHER HIGHEST MOUNTAINS WHO SEEM TO BE THE GREATEST SUSSERERS AS IF FOR PRESU MING95 MING TO MAKE RESISTANCE AGAINST SO STRONG AN ENEMY THEY HAD FARED THE WORSE FOR IT WHICH DURING THE TIME OF THE FIRST GREAT SHAKE AND AS LONG AS THE GREAT SHAKES CONTINUED WHICH WAS ABOVE TWO MONTHS AFTER THE FIRST SHAKE DURING WHICH TIME THE SHAKES CAME VERY STRONG AND THICK SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE IN AN HOUR BELLOW ED FORTH PRODIGIOUS LOUD TERRIBLE NOISES AND ECCHO INGS AS IF THEY WERE SENSIBLE OF THOSE DREADFUL CONVUL SIONS WHICH SO RAGED WITHIN THEIR BOWELS AND IN SO VI OLENT A MANNER TORE AND RENT THEM ASUNDER AS IF THEY COMPLAINED OF THE CRUELTIES OF THAT GREAT I BELIEVE I MAY SAY GREATEST ENEMY TO NATURE THREATNING TO CAST THIS ISLAND INTO ITS FIRST CHAOS OR AT LEAST IN TO A NEW MODEL OR SHAPE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH NATURE FIRST GAVE IT BREAKING ONE MOUNTAIN AND THERE OF MAKING TWO OR THREE AND JOINING TWO MOUNTAINS AND MAKING THEREOF ONE CLOSING UP THE UNHAPPY VAL LEY BETWIXT AND AT YALLOWES PARTICULARLY SOME FAMI LIES WHO LIVED BETWIXT TWO MOUNTAINS WERE SHUT UP AND BURIED UNDER THEM NOT FAR FROM WHICH PLACE PART OF A MOUNTAIN AFTER HAVING MADE SEVERAL LEAPS OR MOVES OVERWHELMED A WHOLE FAMILY AND GREAT PART OF A PLANTATION LYING A MILE OFF AND A LARGE HIGH MOUNTAIN NEAR PORTMO RANT NEAR A DAYS JOURNEY OVER IS SAID TO BE QUITE SWAL LOWED UP AND IN THE PLACE WHERE IT STOOD THERE IS NOW A GREAT LAKE OF FOUR OR FIVE LEAGUES OVER BUT THOSE THINGS HAPPENED IN LOWER MOUNTAINS BUT IN THE BLEW MOUNTAINS AND ITS NIGH NEIGHBOURS FROM WHENCE CAME THOSE DREADFUL ROARINGS TERRIBLE AND AMAZING TO ALL THAT HEARD THEM MAY BE REASONABLY SUPPOSED TO BE MANY STRANGE ALTERATIONS OF THE LIKE NATURE BUT THOSE WILD DESERT PLACES BEING VERY RARELY OR NEVER VISITED BY ANY BODY NOT BY NEGROS THEMSELVES WE ARE YET IGNORANT OF WHAT HAPPENED THERE BUT THE ASTONISHING NOISES THAT CAME FROM THENCE AND THEIR MISERABLE SHATTERD AP PEARANCE96 PEARANCE APPEARING HALF NAKED AND DEPRIVED OF THEIR STATELY ORNAMENTS LARGE ASPIRING TREES AND WHEREAS THEY USED TO AFFORD A FINE GREEN PROSPECT NOW ONE HALF PART OF THEM AT LEAST SEEMING TO BE WHOLLY DEPRIVED OF THEIR NATURAL VERDURE AND ORNAMENTAL COVERINGS IN SUCH SORT THAT THEY HAVE NOT A LEAF TO COVER THEIR NAKEDNESS APPEARING BARE AND RAGGED IN SUCH POOR TORN SHAPES THAT SURELY IT WILL PUT ANY THOUGHTFUL MAN INTO A CONTEMPLA TIVE POSTURE WHO SHALL LOOK AT THEM THERE ONE MAY SEE WHERE THE TOPS OF GREAT MOUNTAINS HAVE FALLEN SWEEP ING DOWN ALL THE TREES AND EVERY THING IN ITS WAY AND MAKING A PATH QUITE FROM TOP TO BOTTOM AND OTHER PLACES WHICH SEEM TO BE PEELED AND BARE A MILE TOGE THER WHICH VAST PIECES OF MOUNTAINS WITH ALL THE TREES THEREON FALLING TOGETHER IN A HUDDLE AND CONFU SED MANNER STOPPED UP MOST OF THE RIVERS FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS WHICH AFTERWARDS HAVING FOUND OUT NEW PASSAGES BROUGHT DOWN INTO THE SEA AND THIS HARBOUR SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND TUNN OF TIMBER AS I HAVE HEARD COMPUTED FROM THE MOST KNOWING PEOPLE THERE WHICH WOULD SOMETIMES FLOAT IN THE SEA IN SUCH PRODIGI OUS QUANTITIES THAT THEY LOOKD LIKE MOVING ISLANDS I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL OF THOSE LARGE TREES ON THIS SHOAR ALL DEPRIVED OF THEIR BARK AND BRANCHES AND GENERALLY VERY MUCH TORN BY THE ROCKY PASSAGES THROUGH WHICH BY THE FORCE OF A FALLING STREAM AND THEIR OWN WEIGHT THEY MIGHT BE SUPPOSED TO BE DRIVEN ONE GREAT TRUNK OF A TREE PARTICULARLY I HAVE SEEN AMONGST THE REST SO SQUEE ZED AS A SUGARCANE AFTER IT HAS PASSD THE MILL SOME ARE OF OPINION THAT THE MOUNTAINS ARE SUNK A LITTLE AND ARE NOT SO HIGH AS THEY WERE OTHERS THINK THE WHOLE ISLAND IS SUNK SOMETHING BY THE EARTHQUAKE PORT ROYAL IS SAID TO BE SUNK A FOOT AND IN MANY PLACES IN LIGANEE I HAVE BEEN TOLD ARE WELLS WHICH REQUIRE NOT SO LONG A ROPE TO DRAW WATER OUT OF THEM NOW AS BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE BY TWO OR THREE FOOT WHICH SEEMS A SORT97 A SORT OF A DEMONSTRATION THAT EITHER THE LAND IS SUNK OR THE SEA RISEN THE FORMER OF WHICH SEEMS MOST PRO BABLE NOR ARE THESE ALL THE EFFECTS OF THE EARTHQUAKENO THE WATER HAD IN SOME MEASURE ITS SHARE AS WELL AS THE LANDIN THIS HARBOUR IN PORTROYAL AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT SHAKE THOUGH SEAS VERY CALM WAS SUDDENLY RAISED SUCH A STRANGE EMOTION IN THE WATERTHAT IMMEDIATELY IT SWELLED AS IN A STORM GREAT LARGE WAVES APPEARING ON A SUDDEN ROLLING WITH SUCH FORCE THAT THEY DRAVE MOST SHIPS IF NOT ALL IN THE HARBOUR FROM THEIR ANCHORS BREAKING THEIR CABLESTO THE GREAT HAZARD OF ALL OF THEMAND TO THE LOSS OF SOME SMALL SHIPS AND SLOOPS C I HEARD PARTICULARLY A MASTER OF A LARGE SHIP OF ABOUT 300 TUN SAY THAT HE THEN RODE WITH TWO STRONG CABLES BOTH WHICH THIS STRANGE VIOLENCE OF THE WATER BRAKE IN AN INSTANT AND THAT HE THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE LOST HIS SHIP WHICH MOUNTED AS IN A GREAT STORM C AND SO IT FARED WITH THE REST OF THE SHIPS BUT THIS WAS SOON OVER AND IN A LITTLE TIME ALL SMOOTH AGAIN ONE CAPT PHIPS TOLD ME THAT HE AND ANOTHER GENTLEMAN HAPPENED AT THE TIME OF THE EARTHQUAKE TO BE IN LIGANEE BY THE SEASIDE AND THAT AT THE TIME OF THE GREAT SHAKE THE SEA RETIRED FROM THE LAND IN SUCH SORT THAT FOR TWO OR THREE HUN DRED YARDS THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA APPEARED DRYWHERE ON THEY SAW LYE SEVERAL FISH SOME WHEREOF THE GENTLE MAN WHO WAS WITH HIM RAN AND TOOK UP AND IN A MI NUTE OR TWOS TIME THE SEA RETURNED AGAIN AND OVER FLOWED GREAT PART OF THE SHOAR AT TALLHOUSE THE SEA IS SAID TO RETIRE ABOVE A MILE TIS THOUGHT THERE WERE LOST IN ALL PARTS OF THE ISLAND 2000 PEOPLE AND HAD THE SHAKE HAPPENED IN THE NIGHT VERY FEW WOULD HAVE ESCAPED ALIVE AND THOSE THAT HAD WOULD IN ALL PROBABILITY HAVE BEEN KNOCKD IN THE HEAD BY THE NEGROES AND THE ISLAND TO ALL INTENTS AND PURPO SES QUITE RUINED P SINCE98 SINCE MY ARRIVAL HERE I HAVE FELT SEVERAL SHAKES THE FIRST AND GREATEST WHEREOF WAS ON GOODFRIDAY IT LISTED ME COMPLEATLY OFF MY CHAIR AND SET ME ON MY LEGS AND WAS SAID TO BE A SMALL SHAKE BUT DID NOT THEN HEAR THE NOISE MINDING SOMETHING ELSE WHICH ALWAYS IM MEDIATELY FORERUNS OR RATHER ACCOMPANIES IT BUT HAVE SINCE FELT SEVERAL LESS SHAKES AND HEARD THE NOISE OFTEN WHICH IS VERY LOUD AND MAY BE EASILY TAKEN BY THOSE NOT USED TO HEAR IT FOR A RUSTLING WIND OR FOR A HOL LOW RUMBLING THUNDER BUT HATH SOME PUSSING BLASTS PECULIAR TO IT SELF AND ARE MOST LIKE THOSE OF A MATCH MADE OF BRIMSTONE WHEN LIGHTED BUT IN A MUCH GREATER DEGREE AND SUCH AS A LARGE MAGAZINE OF BRIMSTONE MAY BE SUPPOSED TO MAKE WHEN ON FIRE IT IS ALSO ACCOMPA NIED WITH A NOISE WHICH MAY BE PRETTY WELL IMITATED BY PUTTING THE TONGUE TO THE ROOF OF THE MOUTH AND IN A WHISPERING HOLLOW TONE LOUDLY PRONOUNCING HUR R R R R R WHEREBY IT IS EASILY DISTINGUISHED FROM EITHER WIND OR THUNDER AND PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY RUNNING OUT OF THEIR HOUSES BEFORE THE SHAKE COMES AND THEN THE NOISE SEEMS TO COME FROM BELOW AND TO BE JUST UNDER ONES FEET WHICH MAKES THE TREMBLING OF THE EARTH MORE TERRIBLE THAN OTHERWISE IT WOULD BE IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT EVERY SMALL SHAKE IS FELT ON SHIPBOARD AS SENSIBLY AS ON SHOAR THE WATER SHAKING AS WELL AS THE LAND IT IS LIKEWISE OBSERVED THAT IN WINDY WEATHER THERE NEVER COMES A SHAKE BUT IN VERY CALM WEATHER IS AL WAYS EXPECTED AND USUALLY COMES ACCORDINGLY THOUGH OF LATE HAS DISAPPOINTED US OFTEN SO THAT NOW WE NEVER EXPECT THEM AND THIS OBSERVATION HATH HELD TRUE IN EVERY SHAKE THAT HATH HAPPENED SINCE MY BEING HERE AND AS IS SAID BY THE MOST CURIOUS AND INDEED ALL PEO PLE HERE IN EVERY SHAKE THAT HATH HAPPENED SINCE THE FIRST GREAT ONE TIS99 TIS OBSERVED THAT AFTER RAIN THEY ARE GENERALLY SMARTER THAN AT OTHER TIMES WHICH MAY BE FROM THE SHUTTING UP OF THE PORES OF THE EARTH WHEREBY THE FORCE IS MORE PENT IN AND HATH NOT SO FREE A PASSAGE TO PERSPIRE AND SPEND IT SELF C SHAKES OFTEN HAPPEN IN THE COUNTRY NOT FELT AT PORT ROYAL AND SOMETIMES ARE FELT BY THOSE THAT LIVE IN AND AT THE FOOT OF THE MOUNTAINS AND BY NO BODY ELSE TIS OBSERVED THAT SINCE THE EARTHQUAKE THE LAND BREEZES OFTEN FAIL US AND INSTEAD THEREOF THE SEABREEZES OFTEN BLOW ALL NIGHT A THING RARELY KNOWN BEFORE BUT SINCE COMMON IN PORTROYAL AND IN MANY PLACES ALL OVER THE ISLAND MUCH SULPHUREOUSCOMBUSTIBLE MATTER HATH BEEN FOUND SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN THROWN OUT UPON THE OPENING OF THE EARTH WHICH UPON THE FIRST TOUCH OF FIRE WOULD FLAME AND BURN LIKE A CANDLE WHAT MAY BE THE CAUSE OF THIS EARTHQUAKE OR HOW DEEP THE CAUSE MAY BE IN THE EARTH C FROM SOME FOREGOING CIRCUMSTANCES A WISE MAN MAY GIVE A NEAR GUESS AT BUT WHY THE EARTH SHOULD SHAKE FOR A QUARTER OF A MINUTE AND THEN STAND STILL FOR SIX OR SEVEN OR TEN DAYS THEN SHAKE AGAIN AND SO CONTINUE TO SHAKE NOW AND THEN BY FITS OR WHY SHAKES SHOULD HAPPEN IN CALM STILL WEATHER AND RARELY OR NEVER IN WINDY OR RAINY WEATHER WHICH FROM A STRICT OBSERVATION IS A CERTAIN TRUTH SEEM TO BE DIFFICULT QUESTIONS ST CHRISTOPHERS ONE OF THE CARIBEE ISLANDS WAS HERE TOFORE MUCH TROUBLED WITH EARTHQUAKES WHICH UPON AN ERUPTION OF A GREAT MOUNTAIN THERE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATTER WHICH STILL CONTINUES WHOLLY CEASD AND HAVE NEVER BEEN FELT THERE SINCE WHEREFORE MANY EXPECT SOME SUCH ERUPTION IN SOME OF THE MOUNTAINS THERE THOUGH WE HOPE THERE IS NO NECESSITY FOR IT THE SHAKES HAVING BEEN OBSERVED TO LOSE THEIR FORCE AND TO BECOME WEAKER AND WEAKER EVER SINCE THE FIRST FATAL ONE AND TIS P 2 NOW100 NOW SO LONG SINCE WE HAVE HEARD ANY EXCEPT NOW AND THEN ONE SO WEAK AS SCARCE TO BE FELT THAT WE HAVE GREAT HOPES THEY WILL SOON QUITE CEASE AFTER THE GREAT SHAKE THOSE PEOPLE THAT ESCAPED AS MANY AS COULD GOT ON BOARD THE SHIPS IN THE HARBOUR WHERE MANY CONTINUED ABOUT TWO MONTHS AFTER THE SHAKES ALL THAT TIME BEING SO VIOLENTAND COMING SO THICK SOMETIMES TWO OR THREE IN AN HOURS TIME ACCOMPANIED WITH FRIGHTFUL NOISES BOTH FROM UNDER THE EARTH AND FROM THE CONTINUAL FALLING AND BREAKING OF THE MOUN TAINS THAT THEY DARED NOT COME ASHOARE OTHERS WENT TO THE PLACE CALLED KINGSTOWN OR BY OTHERS KILLCOWN WHERE FROM THE FIRST CLEARING OF THE GROUND AND FROM BAD ACCOMMODATIONS THEN HUTTS BUILT WITH BOUGHSAND NOT SUFFICIENT TO KEEP OUT RAIN WHICH IN GREAT AND AN UNUSUAL MANNER FOLLOWED THE EARTHQUAKE LYING WET AND WANTING MEDICINES AND ALL CONVENIENCIES C THEY DYED MISERABLY IN HEAPS INDEED THERE WAS A GENERAL SICKNESS SUPPOSED TO PROCEED FROM THE HURTFUL VAPOURS BELCHD FROM THE MANY OPENINGS OF THE EARTH ALL OVER THE ISLAND SO GENERAL THAT FEW ESCAPED BEING SICK AND TIS THOUGHT IT SWEPT AWAY IN ALL PARTS OF THE ISLAND 3000 SOULS THE GREATEST PART FROM KINGSTOWN ONLY YET AN UN HEALTHY PLACE BESIDES THE GREAT QUANTITIES OF DEAD PEO PLE FLOATING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE HARBOUR TO THE OTHER AS THE SEA AND LANDBREEZES BLEW THEM SOMETIMES 100 OR 200 IN A HEAP MAY BE THOUGHT TO ADD SOMETHING TO THE UNHEALTHFULNESS OF THIS PLACE I HAVE NOW GIVEN YOU THE BEST ACCOUNT I CAN OF THE EARTHQUAKE WHICH I WAS FORCED TO PICK UP FROM SEVE RAL PEOPLE WHEREIN NEVERTHELESS I HAVE BEEN AS CAU TIOUS THAT I BELIEVE I HAVE NOT WROTE ANY THING BUT WHAT IS REAL AND TRUE II CON

PSYCHOLOGY OF TOIJCH BY F B DRESSLAR Fellow in Psychology Clark University I Psychology of Touch in General If the nervous mechainism of the body could be viewed apart from the rest of the body with all the nerve trunks aind branches tn situ the form of the body would be duplicated in its esternality by the network of nervous fibres and fila ments which ramify and penetrate every part of the surface of the body It is believed that each one of these fibres or filaments however fine connects directly with the ntsrvous centre aind that whatever stimulus is received by each is car ried to the centre over independent fibres and that no transi tion of stimulus from one fibre to another is possible however closely they may be placed together Not only is the isolation thus perfect but if a fibre be broken or cut there can be no further communication established between the part of the surface where this fibre is attached aind the nervous centres until the distal portion is regenerated If the nerve trunk be submitted to mechanical pressure the communication is severed so long as the pressure continues Thus the whole surface of the body is in more or less complete independent connection at each point with the higher centres and7 as we shall see this independence in structure is necessarily followed by a similar independence in function whereby the great dif ferences in local discriminative ability have arisen aind the conditions aire furnished for further dermal educationOne of the first things to notice and probably the most striking fact in the study of the skin as a sense organ is the great diiierence in its e2itent as compared with the other organs of sense If the sensitive surfaces of a11 the other sense organs were spread out in direct contact with the outer or ob jective world the whole of these taken together would scarcely equal the surface of the palm of the hand Though of course this comparison mllst of necessity be crude for each organ2s sensitiveness is measured by wholly different stimuli and these are incommensurable with respect to each other Still when it is called to mind that eye ear and nose with all their special adaptation are but sspecialized dermal cells the comparison is not wholly without salue Furthermore em bryology teaches that not only are the sense organs thus developed from the skin but that the whole of the brain and the spina1 cord are infolded and developed ectodermic cells The influence of this fuxldamental connection between the higher centres and the skin may be much more farreaching than psychology has yet thought There is at least a sug gestion of the uttnost importance in the philogenetic relation of the skin and the nervous centres Some have dared to hint that the objectivation of the subjective states may here have a real causal basis But it is safer to wait until biologyt at least has more to say on this point before making assertions the proofs for the truth or Ialsity of which are still hidden in the abyss of our ignorance Then too the skin is situated and conditioned unlike any other of the sense organs in that it is turned in all directions The other sense organs are more or less directed toward the front and at all times are limited to a part even of their immediate environs Tn a large measure this limitation is not true of the skin though of course certain accommodations of hand and body are habitually made to facilitate and refine percep tion through touch As a sense organ the skin is much less specialized than any of the other sense organs Its range is not only larger but it takes cognizance of the more fundarrlen tal properties of the material world Our eyes are useless in the dark our ears are without value when there are no vibra tions in matter but the conditions of touch remain so long as there is objective existence at all The skin is the mother sense and out of it all the other senses have been derived The biologists tell us that the eye is only a developed sensory spot of the skin and Preyer 1 even goes so far as to say that as a basis for the fact we are constantly speaking of the quali ties of things seen in terms of qualities only felt such as a l Pflugers Arch 1881 p 75 314 DRESSLARwarm color a cold shade etc that the sense of sight was de veloped out of the sense of temperature If we take the ameba or any of the simpler forms of life we can readily see that their whole life must depend on the kind of reactions they are prompted to make through skin perception The whole surface of the bodies of such organ isms presents to their environs a sort of diffused touchiness apparently not more differentiated in one place than another They are all eye if they see at all all ear if they hear all nose if they smell Wherever they touch a particle of esterior matter they need no further adjustment to know it as far as it is possible for them to know There is no parallel to this in any of the other senses As Aristotle1 has said we can have an animal without eyes without the sense of smell or taste or hearing but all must have the sense of touch In fact it is only the few in comparison that have any other sense than touch With this primordial and farreaching slotion of tonch in mind let us examine the properties of bodies known to man through the senses Perhaps this can be more quickly done by excluding the properties of objects derived from or through the other senses Through the eye we get color and motion and perhaps an indistinct until cor rected and helped by the other senses notion of distance For the ear only sound or vibrations within certain limits For the nose odor and for taste certain chemical stimulants All the rest of our mental lumber has come through the skin either directly or indirectly If we were asked to name the most permanent and most important properties of bodies we shouldnot go out of the realm of touch including the socalled muscle sense which is largely skin sense We would name hardness weight temperature tenacity compressibility shape roughness etc It is easy to see that these are the fundamentals We can easily be deceived in color but not so with hardness Certain interpretations of odors are very largely due to the personal factor but weight does not exist as a variable except in degree We have standards fast and exact for determining weight resistance or cohesion of bodies but not for the strength of their odor or the shades of their colors We do not speak of a person as abnormal if his ear is not discriminative for great difference in tone but we con sider him abnormal if he could not distinguish thousands of variations in location in quality in temperature etc of objects through touch Then again it is perhaps helpful to see that the other senses depend largely on the skin for proof of their assertions as to lPsychology Wallaces Irans p 67 PSYCEOLOGY OF TOUCE 315the more important of their activities We come to judge of form by the eye but we are in constant need of tactual meas urements to correct and prevent misconception Doubting Thomas thus becomes a sort of type for realists all of whom insist on the most certain proofs and so rely on the tangible As Mr Fraser 1 says in his suggestive essay  In the case of the unreflective but practical thinker the question  What do you mean by a real world7 is openly answered and with out bias by saying  It is a world that we can touch 7   v 4 DIe can be persuaded that the object he sees before him is illusory but if he is allowed to stretch forth his hand and can touch it and feel it there the last remnant of doubt as to its real exis tence will have fled Very rarely if ever do you see the fakir or sleightofhand performer practicing his tricks save to deceive through the special senses Indeed the phrase sleightofhand may have for its earlier psychological basis the meaning now hest rendered by slighting of the hand Dr Johnsons reply to the Berkeleyan philosopher who pressed him with his idealism was as everybody knows  Throw a brick at him This fundamental and deep lying significance of perception through touch is seen in the commonest words having for their inlport to knowperceive means to take thoroughly or to take hold of conceive has for its fundamental and original meaning to take hold of things together appe ehend is to catch hold of conxprehend means only to catch hold of more than one thing understand means measurement of things by letting them rest on you we accept a thing men tally when we take hold of it The modern slang phrase catch on illustrates this same tendelrcy to coin terms des ignating intellectual activity And if the theory be true that slang is a linguistic atavism this last phrase is full of psycho logical significance Just what the full meaning of this strong tendency is perhaps does not fully appear yet it is certainly significant in preserving an early and for that matter an inher ent theory of indisputable knowledge  Why touch says one writer  the simplest and earliest sense should in its higher forms be more than any other sense associated with the advance of intelligence is due to the fact that tactual impressions are those into which a11 other impressions have to be translated before their meaning can be known It is certainly true that a highly elaborate ttactual apparatus comes to be the uniform accompaniment of superior intelligence As has often been said the skin is the boun 1 Psychological Foundation of Natural RealismX AMER JOUR PSYCH Vol IV No 3 p 429 316 DRESSLAR1 Illusions P 49 PSYCIIOLOGY OF TOUCH 317 dary between the ego and the nonego that all that is with in is subject and without is object So in touch we come nearer to the thing in itself if you please than through tha medium of any other of the senses We can not smell a thing but only the gaseous particles given off by the thing we can not come into contact with a thiezy through vision but ouly with the vibrations of ether which are radiatedfrom the thing in taste pure and simple we are made cognizant only of a thing after its dissoltltion and not of the thing as a whole So there comes to be less need of interpretation in the case of skin perception than in any other and so less op portunity of illusion Speaking of this point Sully 1 says sTactual perception in so far as it is the recognition of an object of a certaill size7 hardness and distance from our bodies7 involves the least degree of interpretation and so offers little room for error it is only when tactual perception amounts to recognition of an individual object clothed with secondary as well as primary qualities that an opening for palpable error occurs  IIerein lies a pedagogical principle far too infrequently used In the years of childhood we feel the world of sensitive ap pearances nearer to us we live immediately with and in it there is an intimate bond of living dependence which unites us to it and which is otlly broken when we are removed from contact with things The brook to the boy with his pantaloons rolled up and the water gurgling around his legs is far more a brook far more real than to the poet who only hears its gurgle or sees it sparkle This close and intimate relation ship between subject and object which we get through touch has led men to say that if the facts of physiology were rightly interpreted they wollld lead irresistibly to the conclusion that sensation is not confined to the brain but is spread over the whole sensory system Wherever there is a sensory nerve there may be a sensation Johannes Muller said  We do not assert that the mental principle has its seat in the brain alone It is possibe for the mind to act and receive impressions by means of an organ of a determinate structure and yet be present generally throughout the body The mental principle or cause of the mental phenomena the conception of ideas thoughts etc can not be confined to the brain It exists though in a latent state in every part of the organism Or as Isaac Taylor said  The mind is not as we suppose the prisoner of the attic story but is the occapant at large of the entire animalorganization acting in each part of the structure according to the purpose of each  If we consider carefully the probable value of double cuta neous sensation to a child in giving to it the basis for a sep aration of the ego and nonego we shall see without doubt that this simple and oftrepeated experience is of farreaching significance VVhen a child first takes hold of something esternal to itself if there be but a single sensation or set of sensations fused there would not of necessity grow up a notion of otherness But it seems to me this basis for other ness has its origin in the double sensations it receives when it touches and handles its own body If it takes its foot in its hand there are two wholly diiBerent sets of sensations pre sented simultaneously and because of their unlikeness there must come a feeling or consciousness of otherness which in no wise could come through any set of single impressions Later in life we come to use the speclal senses more and more and the skin sensations are left to form the greatest part of the semiconscious state When we stop thinking and just feet we find ourselves in a flood of sensations coming from the skin While it is in a measure true that we are accus tomed to neglect atll of these sensattions notwithstatnding they are pouring themselves in upon us and in no small meatsure constitute the mood atflect the temperatment atnd put the att tention in at statte of uneasiness which demands atnd requires more stimulus to prevent mind wandering than when the sub conscious is minimized We atre mostfully conscious says Bastaan when we are most receptive of esternal impressions and we lapse into at completely or patrtially unconscious con dition when the atdvent of such impressions is for a time prevented or when we are intensey atbsorbed in some train of thought thatt is when the atetivity of other portions of the cerebratl hemispheres in some waty dwarfs or eclipses that of the sensoriatl regions proper  It is to say the leatst an interesting notion of Lotze 1 that whenever we bring at foreign body in contact with the skin the consciousness of our personal existence is prolonged into the extremities atud surfaces of this foreign body According to hiln at tatll headdress is worn preferably becatuse it lengthens our own personality producillg the pleasing illusion thatt we ourselves extend up to thalt point Thus we caln understand the disposition in low stalges of culture per fected alfterwalrds in higher ones to wear plumed helmets waving and lofty coiffllres These fortified the conscious ness of the wealrer with the feeling of a majestic upwalrd es 1 Microcosmu Eng Tran Vol I p 592 et seq 318 DRESSLA Rtension of his personality as well as served to increase the fearinspiring or respectinspiring effect of the figure on others So too high heels and stilts while they raise us off of the ground do not apparently separate us from the ground The cane to the blind man becomes merely a prolongation of his arm and the touch at its end renders him directly con scious of the distance and quality of the object with which it comes into contact The second class of these feelings is derived from all hanging and waving drapery and ornament which causes us to feel as if wewere ourselves present in the floating Kapping folds and streames This notiOn he thinks is the key to the uses of sash arld ribbons girdles bracelets trains and all manner of wearing apparel of this sort Thus the light gausy stuff with which the maiden drapes herself is intended not ouly for the graceful curves that touch the skin in a few points so as to charm others but she herself feels that she is prsent in all of these movements which she dis tinguishes as to the breadth lightness and softness of their sweep To Lotze all this was not mere theory but a funda mental law of dress For he says he has performed for the exact science of dress the same service as Kepler did for astronomy Then again perhaps much of our aesthetic life has a closer connection with the skin sense directly than we are wont to think There is without dollbt truth in Lotzes 1 idea when he says Accordingly it the vesture serves to make obvious to the senses the peculiar mobility of the figure and likewise gives to it by means of the arrangements of it3 hang ing folds a semblance of the feeling which the figure itself preserves through its surroundings and its carriage and in which it delightsJ And again he says in the same volume The pose of the figure in plastic art will always have for its princJpal purpose to show not only the complete adaptability with which the body obeys the spiritual impulse but also that with which every single part by corresponding counter poise tension or relawation compensates for the displacement of every otherS so that the body appears as an e2itremely sen sitive and elastia system of parts which keeps itself in equi librium  It is a noteworthy fact that illusions and hallucinations of the insane come through the sense of touch far less frequently than through sight or hearilIg According to Griesinger 2 in 177 cases of hallucination occurring mostly in sane people the following relations occur in the senses Sight alone 78 1 Outlines of Athetic Tran by Prof Ladd p 76 2 Mental Dieae p 81 et eq 319 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCHsight and hearing together 46 hearing alone 16 sight hearing and touch together 4 with touch alone only 9 He adds that diminution or complete suppression of the sensi bility of the skin to impressions of temperature or pain is by no means frequent still less is it general in insanity Snell found that in 180 patients less than a score were anaesthetic and where anesthesia was present it occurred in cases offer ing very little hope of recovery When we read the history of trials forwitcheraft says Dr Michea we observe that the inquisitors attached a high value to the existence of cuta neous ancesthesia as a sign of demoniacal possession When an individual was charged with the alleged crime the experts aSter having bandaged the eyes passed a magnifying glass over all parts of his body previously shaved with a view of discoverlng the matks of Satan stigmata diaboli The slightest spot on the skin was probed with a needle If the puncture did not cause a painful sensation if it provoked no cry or movement the poor creature was a sorcerer and con demned to be burnt alive If on the contrary he felt the wound he was acquitted  The fundamental character of the skin perceptions appears in a curious and interesting way in the Law It is a well established fact that  mere words will not make an arrest That is to say the offlcer must touch the person whom he wishes to arrest in order to make a binding arrest unless in some way the person upon whom the writ is served submits and shows himself subject to the authority of the officer without being touched This will be made clear from the following decisions  Bare words will not make an arrest but if the bailiff touch the person it is an arreet and the retreat a rescu ous On a motion for an attachment against three persons for a rescuous of a person taken in esecution it was objected that there had not been a legal arrest as the bailiff had never touched the defendant The court said this is a good arrest and if the bailiff who has a process against one says to him when he is on horseback or in a coach You are my prisoner I have a writ against you  upon which he snbmitsturns back or goes with him yet it is an arrest because he submitted to the process but if instead of going with the bailiff he had gone or fled from him it could be no arrest unless the bailifl had laid hold of him     It is not necessary to show the warrant or to tell at whose suit you arrest him unless he demand it And if you have two warrants in your pockets against him and produce neither if he be rescued either party at whose suit the warrants were made out may bring 1 p Gray Chirurgia 1609 libVII c 10 quoted from Winslow 320 DRESSLARan action aigainst the rescuers2 In ainother old caise 1 it nvas decided Genner a bailiff having a warrant agaiinst Sparks went to him in his yaird aind being at some distance told him he haid a warraint and said he arrested him Spairks haiving s fork in his hand keeps off the bailiff from touching him and retreats into his house And this was moved ais a contempt It wais held  The bailifl cain not have an aittaichment for here was no arrest nor rescuous bare words will not make an arrest but if the baiilifl haid touched him thait haid been an arrest and the retreat a rescuous and the bailiff might have pursued and broke open the houset or might have had an attachment or a rescuous against him but as the case is the bailiff has no remedy but an action for the assault for the holding up of the fork at him when he was within reach is good evidence Again 2 44 I have not been able to find any real conflict be tween English and American authorities as to what consti tutes an arrest By all the authorities a person may or may not be alrrested without al manual or actual touching by the officer Bare words alone will not make an arrest if the party resists the alrrest Many other cases mlight be cited but so far as can be determined the same principle is held to in all of them viz  The question as to whether or not an actual physical caption or manual touching of the body of the prisoner is necessary to eflect an arrest depends upon the further question whether or not the arrest is submitted to If the party resists or endeavors to evade it there must be an actual touching of his person or some physical restraint of his liberty to depart in order to complete the arrest mere words will not do in such cases7 The importance of this whole matter for psychology depends upon whether touching as used in arrest is a sur vival of the attempt to take the prisoner by force or whether it be that touch is here recognized as that sense through which errors or misunderstandings are less liable to occur than through any of the other senses To consider it as a survival of the employment of physical force seems by far the more natural e2mplanation and at first thought there seems to be scarcely any other way of looking at it But the question comes how would an officer arrest a blind and deaf man or even a deaf man who could not read except he make known the arrest through toucht This sense is never lack ing completely during normal conscious life and so i8 always an open avenue through which the outer or objective be tomes inner or subjective  See Glenner v Sparks 1 Salk 79 2 Searls v Viets 2 Thomp  a  N Y  224 Pottert J 321 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCHHowever if it be true as seems probable that the touch now recognized in the law of arrest is a survival of a more forcible means of taking possession of the prisoner its present signification is entirely different and I am assured by high authority that it is used llOW to simply make known to the one arrested that he is now in the power of the officer and there is no means of denying it because he was made acquainted with the fact through placing his hand on him The rdle that touch plays in the expression of the emotions of love and friendship can scarcely be overestimated The psychological significance of this fact is seen in many words we use for friendship and love The words attraction aXection and the phrase attached to illustrate this As is readily seen these words have for their fundamental mean ing the notion of being bourld in contact with the loved one and so indicate that there is a desire in us for actual dermal contact in the e2mpression of love and friendship Dr Brinton the eminent Americanist has called atten tion to the fact that the same fundamental significance of theS words for friendship and love is shown in many of the India languages With the Chipeways for example the root for the word love is sakX which means to xttach tofasten The root for the same word with the Aztecs was zo which means to fasterz one with or to another It needs no exhaustive research to see that with all peoples their heartiest salutations and greetings thelr deepest and most fervent feelings of love and friendship require tactual expression It has been the custom at a11 times and among all peoples to shake haolds to embrace to kiss when friends meet True it is that these tactual expressions have taken a great many forms but each of them makes use of some form of contact It would be a most interesting study to trace the racial and local variations of these tactual salutations with especial reference to their development and evolution It seems to me that a careful study of these forms would not only indicates the gradual changes and development of such feelings as they e2mpress but that these accompany the development of finer capabilities of dermal sensitiveness The Feugians and Australians hug each other when they meet Among the ancierlt Jews this same custom prevailed supplemented by a kiss We read in Genesis XXXIII 4 that vEsau ran to meet him Jacob and embraced him and fell on his neck and kis6ed him and they wept One of the most universal customs among the 13ast Indians and the l Essays of an Americanist  Philadelphia 1890  p 410 322 DRESSLAR323 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH Pacific Islanders in general is tllat of  nose rubbing as the travelers are wont to call it These peoples when they salute have the general custom of touching their noses together and perhaps snuffing or smelling of each other The kiss seems not to prevail so estensively among peoples of a lower stage of civilization in their salutations as it does in the higher stages The Orientals as is well known have an elaborate system of salutations in which the kiss plays an important part Indeed this method of salutation appears to have been practiced from the earliest antiquity by Semitic and Aryan peoples If we should ask ourselves why we  shake hands the answer it seems to me is not found in the usual explanation that we then see the one whom we meet does not carry a dagger but in the demand for tactual es pression of friendship It is almost amusing to see to what inconveniences we will submit ourselves merely to grasp the hand of a friend and in return experience pressure from his hand Almost innumerable citations might be made showing how the forms have varied but those given are sufficient to illus trate the point in question Although as has been said the chief purpose of these forms of tactual salutation is that of the expression of the emotions yet the fact must not be over looked that a mere grasp of the hand often furnishes us with data concerning the character of a person not obtainable in any other way The comple2c sensations of warmth of firm ness of grasp of passivity etc etc which we derive from a handshake in no small way affect our opinion of a newy made friend With some these dermal sensations are all powerful A friend related to me an instance which came under his direct observation in which a young lady refused to continue her acquaintance with a young man silnply because as she said the touch of his hand gave her the horrors It seems that with each of us there is a certain delicacy of touch a certain degree of warmth a certain amount of pressure best suited for personal satisfaction and corresponding to our notion of the best and fittest 1 l Since the above wa written I have found that Dr Brinton has expreed the ame idea in hi recent book  17ie hrsKit of lzappi nese D G Brinton Philadelphia 1893 p 131 He

Weber concerning the great local diflerences in the discriminative ability of the skin for the compass points marked an epoch in toueh psychology IIis work not only stimulated to careful ana tomical studies in order to know more of the skin as a sense organ from the anatomieal sidet but it has led to studies whose object has been to determine the possibilities of educa tion in the discriminative ability of the skin A W Volkmannl found that the distance between the aompass points placed at the minimum distance they could be felt as two on different parts of the bodyX collld be greatly decreased for any given part by esercise And not only did this education show itself with regard to the special territory esercisedt but strangely enough the ssrmmetrical part on the other half of the body was likewise very lnarkedly increased in fineness for this spacial discernment He found that this increase however was soon lost for both sides when the esercise was given upt and that after a months rest the increase was wholly lost Suslowa observed that if the part of the skin lying between the compass points be stimulated by means of an induction current or some light mechanical stimulus such as touching it with a pencil the sensitiveness for localizing was increased Funke found just as Weber did that on the median lines of the body the skin is not so discriminative for the compass points He also found that after a monthis esercise of a portion of the skin on the median line between the shoulder blades there was but little or no increase in the power to discriminate between the compass points This ability to localize however varies greatly with different people Valentine found that corresponding points on diflerent people varied even to a diflerence of fourold as regards their ability to distinguish the compass points as separate But he also found that the ratios between the numbers expressing the fineness of discrimination for difler ent parts of the skin of one person was about the same as that of another even though much ahsolute difference esisted in their abilities to liscriminate finely Speaking in a general way the more mobile the part of the body the finer the discrimination it possesses According to Vierordt the relative fineness of the sense of locality of a given point of the skin of a parS of the body7 is a function of 1 Berichte d SSchsischen Gesellschaft d Wissenschaften p 38 f a Hermanns Handb d Physiol III ii p 38 324 DRESSLAR325 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH its mobility depending on the relative extent of the excursion which it makes in the movements of the parts concerned around its own a2is and increases proportionally with its separation from the a2is upon which the part turns While the facts do not support this socalled law completely it must be regarded as e2mpressing in a general way approsi mate truth In order to test the work of Volkmann and others I began and carried out a series of experiments with special parpose of determining 1 how rapid the increase in sensitiveness through practice would be under given conditions 2 to what estent the transference of this increased power would be made 3 whether the sensitiveness of the surrounding parts would be raised or not and 4 the curve for the loss of the power thas gained after the esercise of the part had ceased METHOD OF WORK The tests were made on two subjects F B D a man and C NV D a woman For F B D an area of the skin 7 cm square on the palm side of the lower part of the left arm7 beginning about 5 cm below the elbow was selected while for z W D a portion of the skin of the right arm 5 cm square also on the palm side half way from the wrist to the elbow was taken Ill making the tests an sthesiometer was used whose points were of ivory and moderately sharp It will be seen by referring to the table that two sittings for each subject were taken daily with the exception of a few days practically at the same time each day and extending over a month In the beginning of the work both arms of each subject were tested carefully on equal symmetrical parts and the discriminative ability noted for each After this ability had been determined foln both arms of each subject experimentation was confined to the right arm for z NV D and to the left for F B D At each sitting from twenty five to forty observations were made on each subject The subject being blindfolded the skin was touched with the sesthesiometer and the subject asked to judge whether one or two points of the instrument were touching the skin The operator was careful to present these two conditions indiscriminately and equally often The subject was so situated that the arm was always at rest and not otherwise stimulated The operator was careful when two points were presented to have them touch the skin as nearly as possible at esactly the same time otherwise the dis criminative power would be reduced to that of the timesense for326 DRESSLA R impressions or at least so confased with it that the results would be too colnples and varied Then too care was needed to so shift about over the part to be stimulated that the afterimages would be as little as possible confusing To this end it was necessary to work often quite slowly and not to make too many observations at one sitting Besides the effect of fatigue was plainly noticeable after a long series of observations and so it was important to notice this factor The method of finding the exact symmetrical part on the arms consisted in inking afresh the boundary lines of the spot es ercised and then after placing the palms of the hands together symmetrically pressing the arms together Thuss the same sized area and esactly symmetrically placed was obtained The same plan was used at first so as to obtain the relative ability of the two arms before either had undergone any  t specla  eserclse RESULTS The following table is a statement of the daily ability to discriminate with the date and time of day given The results are given in mm and in all cases represent the distance between the two points of the eesthesiometser where at least seventyfive per cent of the judgments were correct It will only be necessary to glance down the columns to see the great increase in the discriminative ability A s will be seen for a w D the distance of the points to begin with was 21 mm but the average distance of the last week was ouly 4 mm For F B D at the beginning of the work the points must be separated 33 mm while the average distance for tne last week was only 3 mm TABLE I DATE a w D F B D  A

practically no diflerence thus following what might be termed a general law in education viz one of the first effects of practice is to eliminate accidental hindrances to render the work more and more mechanical and so less sub ject to variations due to unconscious influences By referring to the general average it is seen that the completed results for the month retain this preference in a slight degree but it must be understood that these diflerences are due to those that arose in the first week Perhaps it would be well to call attention here to the abso lute difference in serlsitiveness as shown by the table for the two subjects A great deal has been said about the compara tive sensitiveness of the seses with regard to touch though a very few of such statements have been based on the results of accurate experiments It would be wholly unscientific for me to make any general statement in regard to this question simply because my experiments have been limited to two sub jects EIowever for these two the following may be said In the first place it must be remembered that the part of the arm chosen for C W D a woman was absolutely more sellsitive than the part of the arm chosen for F B D a man because that of the former was nearer the wrist than that of the latter Hence the diSerence in sensitiveness at the start betwist the two subjects should not be construed to mean that one or the 327 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH328 iDRSELAR other had the greater power of discrimination but that thev diiierence arose chiefly because of the different positions of the parts exercised in the two subjects By keeping this dif ference in mind it is clear that F B D showed in a slight degree the greater sensitiveness of the two That is he be gan with a part of the skin of less normal diseriminative ability and succeeded in reaching a slightly higher discrimi native ability than a w D Bitaterat Transference of the Eyects of Education of the Sktn One of the chief purposes of this work as has been said was to test the transference of the eiiects of esercise of the skin on one arm to that of the corresponding part of the other These tests were made as exhibited in the table after a months work and after it seemed that the appro2imate limits had been reached with regard to discriminative ability The method used in making the tests was as follows The aesthesiometer was set for first test at 5 mm whenever both points were pressed against the skin in order to test what was considered the possible limit for discrimination before any esercise in testing might render the part more sen sitive Out of fortyfive observations C W D made but eleven errors thus showing clearly that even when the points were so near they could be recognized as two in seventyfive per cent of the cases The nest day another series of forty five observations was taken with the points separated by 10 mm when it was showll that eighty per cent of them could be judged correctly The first test made for F B D was likewise for 5 mm and out of fifty observations eighty per cent of them were correctly judged In order to show more clearly the transference of the increased ability to the corresponding part of the opposite arms the following table is introduced which shows the ability of both arms before and after the months esercise BEFORE EDUCATINGE C WD FBD Date Time LeftArm Right

From the result of these tests it is plain that either the ed ucation had crossed over so to speak or that the general discriminative ability had been wonderfully sharpened Tbat it was not largely due to the latter was proved in the following way Tests were made on the neighboring parts of the skin to those educated at the end of the monthis work and the discriminative ability found to be much inferior to that of the part exercised and its corresponding part on the other arm It is no doubt true that the general sensibility was slightly increased but just how much it is somewhat diffi cult to say Unfortunately no general tests were made before the experiments began to test whether or not the sensibility had been raist3d for distant parts of the body such as one might naturally expect from education of the attention for this special kind of discrimination Other evidence however unexpectedly came out during the course of the experiments to prove that the education was limited to the locality in question A s was stated above tests were made on the telqritory surrounding the esercised part and its corresponding part on the other arm which not only revealed the fact there mentioned but also a marked differ ence in the quate of the local sensations more striking in the arms esercised but distinguishable in the others also So much so that the subject could locate with a fair degree of accuracy the boundary of the esercised part merely through this acquired quality in the local sign This difference in quality is best illustrated by the difference in the quality of the sensations easily recognized which arise from touching a fingertip and immediately afterward some point on the back of the hand There is not only an immediate recogni tion of a difference in location but there is a different feeling present in the two cases By touching the tips of two neigh boring fingers or for that matter one on each hand the differ ence in the quality of thefeeling is much less marked than in the former case The change in the quality of the sensation as Wundt t remarks  is gradual as we pass from one point to another on the skint and especially on the less discrimi native parts of the skin is the change slow Thus it was that this difference in the quality of the sensations was especially noticeable on the arms for the change was so marked and so rapid near the boundary of the territory esercised and its corresponding part on the other arm that it attracted the at tention of both subjects Given this change in the quality of the sensationst the question naturally comes how did it arise  Surely not in a change in the fundamental structure of the end organ because the time required for the development of this qualitative difference was too short for such changes It mllst be that this rapid change was due to functional changes in the end lVorlesungen uber Menschen und Thierseele Vol I p 214 2 PllT  D rTT 21wJSJVJWJb V   XVJ58e 329organ The greatly increased ezrercise of the part would natllrally tend to a larger development of these organs and hence there would come a quicker response to the stimulus and especially a greater amount of nervous force would be liberated by a given stimulus Wundtl says  the difference in the structure of the sense organ is the chief cause of the different quality of the sensation Just as differences in tone and color fundamentally depend on the structure of the end organ in the ear and in the eye so all qualitative differences which belong to any single organ have their necessary basis in the smaller variations which may appear in the strlletllre or in the arrangement of the end organ The Rate of the Loss of this Increased Sensibility An other purpose of this research as stated above was to determine as nearly as possible the rate of the loss of this increased sensibility after the special esercise had ceased It is clear that an esact curve of this kind can never be found simply because the tests made to determine the exact state of the sensibility would naturally prevent the loss of the increased power as rapidly as it would occur without the tests While in a general way it was known that the loss was rapid no definite observation3 had previously been made so far as I knew on this special point In determining how often the tests should be made in order to approsimate he normal curve of such a relapse there wasX therefore no help to be derived from well defined facts bearing on the question It was decided however that the first test should be made one week after the special esercise had ceased and let the results of this test aid in directing further experiments It will be seen by the accompanying table that it was a mis take to wait so long before making the first test for the decline at the first was very rapid and decreased in rapidity inveisely as the tinle Later tests were made more often but varied in time if perchance thereby a few points in the curve could be hit upon But as will be seen by the table given the decline of this acquired sensibility was much more rapid than had been anticipated and hence no definite curve caD be given The results here tabulated however give something of a glimpse of the true curve and in two places show that it was nearly reached This table is of value tchiefly as a guide to other workers in this line though it is not without some value as an approximation to the facts sought 1 op Cit p 2t7 330 D   iSELARPSYOROLOGY OF TOJaE 331 TABLE SHOWING THM DECLINE OF TEI8 ACQURED SEN8IBILITY ForF B D JUDGMZNT8 DATE SPACE

esthesiometer were separated by a space of 5 mm eighty per cent of the judgments were cor rect on the same day in the evening with the points at 10 mm apart eightyfour per cent of the judgments were cor rect On November 19 with no intervening esercise it was wholly impossible to distinguish with the aesthesiometer set at 5 mm and three days later less than seventyfive per cent of the judgments were correct at 10 mm and so on for the other days as indicated Observations Throughout the entire series of experiments note was taken of all subjective esperiences which it was thought might elucidate or direct in the e2mperiments The following statements sumuarize the chief points noted 1 Some time must elapse between two successive appli cations of the aesthesiometer so as to give time for the after images to die away otherwise these will fuse with the primary image and render differentiation much more difficult 2 The discriminative ability is less acate at the beginning and close of the sitting than toward the middle After a few esperiments at the beginning the sensibility increases with an increased dow of blood to theparts whiletoward the close there is a slight dulling caused by fatigue 3 Under certain conditions not yet fully determined much greater pressure was required to render the sensations clear and definite 4 The same amount of pressure on diflerent parts of the arm gives very diflerent degrees of pain That is to say the normal amount of pressure on a certain part giving no pain would if eserted on another place produce a sharp pain It seems that this difference is not wholly due to difference in the thickness of the skin but to inherent dilierence in sensibility to pain 5 The discriminative ability is finer when the two points of the aesthesiometer are pressed against the arm in a cross direction than when they are pressed lengthwise  Sotten332 DRESSLAR kamp and Ullrich found that this preierence for the cross direction for the upper extremities over the lengthwise direction was on the flexor side oneeighth and on the es tensor side onefourth 6 Care was required during each sitting to keep the arm in a natural position else the stretching of the skin rendered the sensibility abnornlally acute III Experiments on Open and Filled Space for Touch Tests wsth Active Touch It is a well known fact that if two equal adjacent spaces are compared by the eye the one filled and the other empty the filled space will appear the greater The purpose of the following selies of experi ments was to determine whether this would hold good for tlle sense of touch That is whether of two equal spaces the one oSering the greater number of stimulations to the touch org3ns as the finger is moved along through the spaces would be judged the greater or not It is perhaps well to explain a little fllrther here what is meant by open and filled space for touch Of course in a strict sense there can be no empty or open space for touch But by open space in this connection is meant a smooth homogeneous surface such as the surface of a bit of well sized cardboard By filled space we mean the same sort of a surface punctured from the under side so as to oSer to the sense of touch a series of alditional and sharply defined sensations The question arises here how should these spaces be situated witll regard to each other e Is there any source of error in the method adopted from Professor James of dividing a line into two parts marking a puncture at each extremity and filling one part of this line with punctures and leaving the remainder for the open space and thus be able to pass the finger over both spaces with one continuous movemellt  To illustrate let the space between the dots at a and b in the accomparlying diagram represent the open space and that included between the dots at b and x represent the filled space a b x This question might be raised If the tip of the finger be passed from a to z and the subject be asked to judge of the comparabive lengths of the spaces ab and bx is it not to be expected from a physiological reason that ab would seem shorter because its length would be judged on the basis of the sensations received from the time the last sensitive point of the finger tip left the puncture at a until the 7frst one333 PHYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH touched at b t We should answer yes and were it not that exactly the same thing occurs in case of the filled space there would be a permanent source of error in the method even for relative judgments That these relative judgments have not been influenced in this way is plainly evidenced by the fact that the apparent length of the filled spaces depends on the zumbe7 of punctures Then too it might be supposed that retardation of the movement due tz friction as the finger tip passed over the roughened filled space would have a tendency to make the filled space seem longer b1lt that this was not the case is the testimony of a11 the subjects because the filled spaces were not so rough as to prevellS free move ment This too is proved by tlhe factl tlhat increase in the number of punctures although increasing the apparent length of the space in most instances did not increase tlhe roughness of the space but on the contrary made it more easy for the finger to pass over With these apparentl objections outl of the way let us pass directly to the problem Prof Jamesl says XIf one divide a line on paper into equal halves puncture the extremities and make punctures all along one of tlhe halves then with the fingertip on the oppositle side of tlhe paper iollow the line of pllnctures the empty half will seem much longer than tlhe punctured half He does not say how oftlen this was tried or whether tlhe re sults obtained were the same when the finger passed first over the punctured half and then over the open as when it passed in the opposite order Neither is there anything said of the absolute lengths of the spaces compared Think ing that these conditions if they were introduced into the experiment might influence the results I have carried on a series of experiments in the following way to determine the influence of these conditions Apparatus 1 Eighteen cards were made according to Prof James method from wellsized stiff cardboard and about the same width with the spaces to be judged similarly placed for each card 2 The spaces to be judged ranged from 2 cm to 16 cm as can be seen in the accompanying table 3 A number of cards were varied only in the num bh3r of punctures in the same space That is the punctllres in these cards were made closer togJether The punctures were all made with the same point and on any given card in the punctured space were equally separated from each other It seems probable at any rate that whatever the re sults might be the introduction of these variables would be lPsychologyVolII p241 Loebfound the opposite to be true for rough and smooth threads Pflugers Archiv Vol XLI p 121 334 DRESSLAliC helpful in arriving at some explanation 4 Almost ara equal number of experiments were taken with each of the spaces presented first for it was thought perhaps that the afterimages of the punctures when presented first might ap pear to lengthen the punctured part The first series that of a xv D was made on a wholly naive subject and at no time were the cards permitted to be seen or the purpose of the experiment mentioned The cards were never presented in the same way two successive times and the short ones were distributed so that no possible means of establishing an incidental and illegitimate means of judg ing was brought in The other series given in the table were made on men who had thought and read more or less on the pointt and could not be said to be ignorant of the purpose of the experiment Their records however show that they judged according to their sensations and hence they are in the main uniform TABLE II Part t COMPABISON 0F OPEN

two double columus the cards were exactly alike save in the number of punctures in the filled side the one having but four the other nine punctures in 2 cm Results With C W D out of nineteen judgments between an open space of 2 cm and the same amount of adjacent space pllnctured witfh four Aoles equally sepalrated eighteen judg ments were made in favor of the punctured space being longer to one in favor of the open space being longer when the open was presented first and e2raetly the same proportion when the punctllred was presented first In the second column the same length of spaces was used that is 2 cm for the open and the same for closed but instead of only four panctures there were nine in the filed space IIere it will be seen that the filled space was judged to be longer every time for a w D and by referring to the accompanying table it will be seen that out of a total of sistysis judgments for this card sistyfive of them were in favor of the filled space being longer In the ne2rt three columns that is in the third fourth and fifth are tabulated the Judgments rendered on three cards al of which were exactly alike save in the number of punctures in the filled space It will be seen by referring to the totals in these columus that increase in the number of punctures in the same space increased the number of judgments in favor of the filled space being the longer Thus C W D in the336 DRESSLAR first colunln of this set made seventeen judgments ten were in favor of the filled space being longer and seven in favor of the open In the second column of the sets twenty judgments were made seventeen in favor of the filled space and three in favor of the open In the third column of the set eighteen judgments were made with fifteen for the filled and three for the open By glancing at the totals at the bottom of these cclumns it will be seen that these proportions were more than borne out by the other subjects That is the totals show that with the increase in the number of punctures in the same space the space appeared longer even in the third column of the set These judgments it must be remem bered were between two spaces 3 cm of open space and 3 cm of filled space so that even if the number of judgments were equal fot the two it would show a preference for the filled space But when it is seen that under these conditions the totals show the ratios of preference to be 1g 3 alld 5 for the Slled spaces respectively it makes a clear demonstra tion not only that filled space seems longer for active touch but that the greater the number of separate sensations re ceived in the filled space the longer it appears to be Now it is clear that this increase in the apparent length of the filled space would not indefinitely increase with the increase in the number of punctures but that there would be a point reached where these would not be separately distinguishable and the number of the sensations would diminish rather than increase so that we should have a right to expect a decrease in the number of judgments preferring the filled rather than the open as the longer This same influence of the number of punctures or in other words the number of distinct sensations received in passing over the same amount of space is seen by comparing the last double column of judgments in Part 1 with the first in Part 2 Here the spaces in each case were the same that is 5 cm but in the former there were but sis punctures in the filled space while in the latter there were eleven By glancing down these columns it is plain to see that the filled space in each case was preferred but much more often relatively in case Jf the card with eleven punctures The totals show the ratios of the judgments to be two and onetenth and three and twofifths respectively That is to say there were two and onetenth judgments in the first case in favor of the filled to one in favor of the open but in the second there were three and twofifths to one in favor of the filled It seems that no further explanation of the results bearing on this point Ileed be made but that this is seen to be true within certain limits in all parts of the table Eowever it is clear that as the337 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH spaces to be compared increase in length the influence of the filled space is less and less marked That is to say when the spaces to be compared are more than 10 cm in length the illuslon does not hold so steadily For example the open space is judged longer more times than the filled where each sIace was 12 cm although the filled had thirteen punctures It is evident that with the longer spaces the subjects were guessing quite largely though in a general way the filled spaces were preferred for the longer The notes I made at the time of making the e2rperiments are valuable here With no exceptions the subjects complained of the length of these longest cards constantly saying they had no sure basis for their judgments often saying that the judgment was a mere guess 13specially they complained of the long open space as being so indefinite because in passing the finger over it there was a sort of ansious effort to guide the finger through this blank so to speak in order that it would strike clearly the first puncture of the filled space The hes itancy and caution here introduced would have a tendency to make these longer open spaces appear longer than they other wise would and in this manner in a slight degree at least vitiate the results However as has been said even in a general way the longest open spaces 1lsed do not seem so long as eqllally long filled spaces The ne2rt question is what difference in the judgments arose when the open space was presented first as corupared with those where the filled came first  Or in other words when two equal spaces are to be compared as to their length by touch one filled and the other open does it make any dif ference in the judgluents which is given firstt This ques tion can be answered by saying that when the spaces to be compared are short less than 5 cm each there is practi caly no difference btlt that above this as far as we went there is quite a difference though varying slightly with dif ferent subjects By examining the double columns of totals on the right of each of the foregoing tables these statements are made more clear Take for example the first subject again C W D it will be seen that in Part 1 the whole number of judgments rendered in favor of the open being the longer was twentytwo when the open was presenked first and nineteen when the filed was preserlted first and 144 and 130 respectively in favor of the filled as being the longer Of course twentytwo and nineteen can not be directly com pared unless the whole number of judgments in the two cases were the same As this was not the case the ratios of the judgments in the two cases should be compared and these are found to be the same viz one to four and fivetenths in338 DRESSLAR each casts By following down the columns further in the same part it will be seen that for some subjects there seems to be quite a difference even when the spaces were less than 5 cm but as there were comparatively few esperimenta mavde on eaveh of these subjects the difference ought not to count for too much But in Part 2 it will be seen that for every subject save olle when the filled space was presented first there was an increase in the number of judgments pre ferring the open spaces as the longer Just why this should be so is not so easy to say But it is perhaps due to the ravpidity with which the sensations die out as the finger is moved through the spaces Here again the notes made dur ing the progress of the experiments are helpful in making an explanation It was observed that the longer the spaces compared the greater the number of trials that were required for the subjects to come to a decision Not only this but each of them remarked that the long ones were very indefi nite and that by the time the finger was passed over both spacesS no definitely clear notion of the length of the first oneA was left Testts with Passive Touc7z The problem of getting reglllar and steady motioll of the proper rate for passive touch occu pied much of my time before it was finally and satisfactorily solved The collditions which it was necessary to satisfy were lThatthemotion should be of uniform rate 2 that it shollld be unaffected by any slight friction aTld 3 that the card should thlls be brought in contact with the finger with sufficient and regular frequency lIappening to be in the shop of the university mechanic one day I noticed that in the movement of av planer for metalsS which was lUll by a steamengine the above conditions could be easily ful filled Its movement was horizontal and could be regulated as to speed and frequency of return while at the same time the apparatus was so massive that the motion would Ilot in the least be influenced by a smalll amount of friction All that was required then in order to make this serve the purpose was to arrange a stationary arm rest and to fasten a rack to the moving bed of the planer to hold the cards Having made these arrangements the conditions were then fully sat isfied and the same tests collld be made with the cards for passive touch that had been made for active touch The subjects were seated at right angles to the moving bed of the planer with the arm at rest By simply extending the finger tip over the end of the arm rest it was thus brought into contact with the puIlcttlres oE the moving card In this case as in the tests witb active touch the fingertip was kept in contact with the card only when the motion was in oneTotals 0 21 0 21 4 16 0 20 8 12 0 21 6 15 3r3 33 3 625 254 44 3 Y 0 9 0 9 3 6

Table This table is identical in plan with the one given for active touch save in this one there is no specification of the number of punctures in each filled space The number was not indicated because the punctures were made equally far apart in each case Results There were 312 judgments under these conditions of which 270 were in favor of the filled space This too in spite of the fact that the open spaces of the fourteen cards used were really longer than the filled If we consider the 339 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH direction To do this the finger was raised from the card during the backward motion of the planer The subject thus had opportunity to try as often as he wished before coming to a decision as to which of the two spaces was the longer In all the tests with passive touch the cards were presented with the open space always coming first It was deemed unnecessary to take any tests with the spaces reversed be cause of the negative results with this variation in the tests with active touch The subjects were blindfolded during the tests and directed to make their judgments wholly upon the basis of their sensations Under these conditions as stated it is very clear that all aid in determining the relative lengths of the two spaces coming from the sensations derived from voluntary move ment was eliminated That is to say the various 3udgments of the subjects were based only on the sensations of touch Cards with punctures as previousy described were usedt because with these there was much less likelihood of introduc ing an element of pain As soon as the points became dulled by repeated touchings new cards were substituted which thus kept the spaces constant and their relations unchanged The following table shows the judgments of the subjects there named under the

DE2ESSLAR judgments made when the open spaces were always longer than the filled spaces with which they were compared we will still find a great preference for the filled space The number of judgments made from a comparison of the spaces on the eight cards whose open spaces are always longer than their filled spaces is 178 Of this number the filled spaces were judged to be the longer 138 times while the various open spaces were Judged to be the longer only forty times It i a waste of space and time to take up each card and show that in every case the totals give a greater numEer of judg ments for the filled space If t11e reader will ouly glance at the results of each colume this fact will be manifest Tesfs wAzen the Tacttle Sueface of the Finyerttp was Ltmited It was mentioned previously that there might seem to be a fault in the method thus far used in that when the entire width of the tip of the finger was brought into contact with the points the notion of the length of the open space would be formed from the space passed over from the time the last sensitive point of the finger left the point at the be ginning of the open space until thegrst sensitive point touched the beginning of the closed space thus of course maliing the open space appear shorter than it reallsr was While as was said it was thought that this was counter balanced by the same thing happening with the closed space to prevent any possible error in the results the following variation in the method for passive touch was introduced ilt is plain that if there be any fault in the method as indicated it could only be remedied by limiting the amount of the tactile surface of the fingertip to the space of a single sensory circle Thiswasaccomplished in the following way The arnlrest previously mentioned was lengthened so as to pass entirely across and above the moving cardrack directly over this moving rack a slot was cut in the board forming the armrest and into this slot a strip of tin was fitted so as to e2rtend downward below the lower side of the board and approach the surface of the card Throtlgh this tin a hole was made just so large that when the finger was pressed against it a portion of its sensitive surfacet less than 2 mm in diameter protruded and came into contact with the punetllres of the card passing along underneath By this means 1lof only was the possible error in the results avoided but all motion of the finger either real or suggested was wholly eliminated A11 the conditions of this series of tests were the same as those in the previous tests save the saria tions above described It perhaps might be well to say here that punctured cards were used throughout the whole series of testsThe tests made under these last conditions give the following condensed results By using cards made and spaced esactly as those used in the tests with passive touch whexI the fingertip was not limited out of 200 judgrrlents only thirtythree were in favor of the opellt whlle 167 sere in favor of the closed being the longer thus maintaining practi cally the same proportion of preference for the closed as in the tests with the other methods These judgments were parposely obtained from subjects who had llOt served for me in the previous tests in order to be sure that they be com pletely naive The observation made by Herr lAfellinghoff as reported by Wundt 1 to the effect that if the space between two points be divided into two equal parts by a dot and tJherl one of these parts be again divided into h31ves by another dot the half of the whole space thus filled seems shorter for the eye than the open half does not hold true for touch To see whether or not this held for touch I made a series of experiments with cards prepared to meet the above conditions but foundin the tests rrlade thereon that the preference was as marked for the filled space under these conditions as it was in any of the previous tests for passive touch The question now arises what is the meaning from a psychological point of view of these results  In the first place it is plain that a closed space for the sense of touch just as for that of sight appears longer than an equal open space Hence the esplanations heretofore given wholly based on the difference in time the eye us3ed in passing over opened and filled space must stop short of the real truth That this illusion holds for touch is I think com pletely demonstrated by my experiments in passive touchy and in these the time used in passing ove equal spaces was exactly the same Hence differences in this eleinent cannot here enter into the explanation The fact is that in the comparison of these two separate trains of senseperceptions the one which was the fuller of deSnite and distinct sensa tions seemed the longer though equal time had been con eumed in the passage of each train across the focus of consciousness All have noticed how much longer a road seems when first passed over than it does after it becomes a familiar and often traveled road The first time it is passed overS everything appears in consciousness even to the minor deXils of the scenery but as it becomes more familiar there come to be only a few points such as halfway places or some peculiar objects which are noticed at all while the 1 Physiologtsehe Psychologte 4th ed Vol II p 142 341 PHYCHOLOGY OF TOUCHstretches between are 8 open spaces One cannot read Sinleys1 description of the great African forest without feeling the vastness of it chiefly because he makes one crowd into a small space of time images of multitudes of plants and shrubs and trees and insects and then reminds you that all you have in mind must represent only those things seen within a small radials for you cannot even see through to the sun light Besides he merely mentions and hastens leaving the reader with only suggestions from which to bedeck the trees with their varied foliage and festoon them with myriad vines In the tests I made with the cards it was not only found that of two equal spacesj the one open and the other filled the filled one seemed the longer but also it was found that of two filled spaces of equal extent the one more completely filled seemed the longer It must be remembered however that more coinpletely filled space in this connection means capacity to present to the subject in a given time a greater number of distinct sensuous stimuli It is clear that if too great a number of distinct stimuli be poured in upon the sub ject in a given time they would drop below the threshold of diflerentiation and such a train would be classeli with those which arise from what we have termed open spaceX For ex ampla if we run the fingers rapidly over a piece of coarse cloth or a wire screen instead of a number of distinct sensa tions there is but one continuous undifferentiated sensation i or if we glance over the lawn the sensation is as if there were but one continuous stimulus though we know it to be pro duced by the fusion of the stimuli from countless grassblades The conclusion to which our results lead us then is that if we have given two trains of senseperception produced in the mind in equal duraStions of time the one which is made up of the greater number of distinct sensations requires of the mind a greater amount of space in its reference to the exter nal world provided of course that these trains are special at a11 It should be noted that this generalization says nothing of the origin of our notion of space but only calls attention to the fact as exhibited in adult mental life A s to whether this be an inherent mental tendency or the result of habitual associa tions the tests here made have nothing at all to say There is thus oiiered abundant opportunity for speculation and hypotheses but we prefer to run no risk in ptlrting company with the truth and so will be content to await the outcome of a continuation of these

weight but of different size the smaller one appeared the heavier when lifted The purpose of the following series of experi ments was to determine how the perception for certain weights could be influenced nvheIl 1 they were of the same shape and wetght but different in stze and 2 when they were of the same stze and wetyAt but different in shape The wellknown experiments of 1 H Weberl and Fechner2 will be recalled here They experimented with weights of the same shape and size but of differentl absolute ueight The purpose of these workers was to determille the fineness of dis crimination for difference in weight The work here de scribed is of a very different nature from theirs nevertheless the results obtained show the need of great care in the prepa ration of weights for such nvork as theirs and in so far is sup plemental to their work The purpose of this work however was to make a study in association and apperception by making use of one of the strongest associations we make in life viz that of two given weights of the same material the larger is the heavier This association we have filmly fised because of the often recurring and immediate sequence oftthe ideas Indeed if it could be said of any association that it is inborn or racially fised it could be truly said of this one Tests on School ChzZdren 3 Upon these a study was made concerning the illusions arising from comparing weights of the same shape and weight but different in size To make this study I constructed some weights in the following way A brass tube a little over an inch in diameter was cut into small tubes of the following lengths No 1 10 in 2 2 in 3 2 in 4 3 in 5 3 in 6 4 in 7 4 in 8 5 in They were each made to weigh 132 grams by filling them with diiierent substances and were all capped over with care fully fitted bits of brass Care was taken to distribute the weight throughout the whole of each tube so that one end lDer Tastsinn und das Gemeingefuhl Wagners

School Omaha Ne braska who carried out under my direction this long series of tests on the public school children of Omaha Her work of making the tests was of the most painstaking and careful kind and deserving of the highest commendation Also my thanks are due to Supt Fitz patrick of the city schools of Omaha for his interest and coopera tion in the work344 DRESSLAR should not be heavier than the other and thas introduce a disturbing element when they were lifted There was noth ing in the ezaternal appearance of any of them which would in any way suggest a difference in weight save their difference in size It will be seen that the tubes increasedin length regularly by half an inch and when set up they formed a series of regularly ascending steps The design of this ar rangement was to determine what effect such a relationship would have in suggestion so as to continue the illusion for the whole series The suggestion thus made became so strong that when the subjects beg3n to see that the tubes could be arranged in a regular order in many instances the judginents were changed and the tubes were made to occupiy a place according to size In some cases however this sug gestion had the opposite effect that is it caused a disar rangement which would probably not otherwise have been made simply as the subjects afterward acknowledged be cause they thought it improbable that the tubes had been made so as to decrease in weight so regularly These of course were not strictly legitimate judgments and should be cast out of the results wherevf3r they are known to exist But as there were very few of such they have not apprecia bly iniluenced the Snal results In all cases where the sub ject permitted his judgments to be made from the sensations purely the arrangement is probably without a variation in order of their size So with most of the subjects the illusion was strengthened by attracting their attention to this regular difference in size Constant care was talaen in making the experiments not to suggest to the sllbjects that they were given a puzzle to work or that there was anything strange about the experiment The tubes were put before them and thep were simply asked to arrange them in order of their weight These words were used because it was thought they were freest from suggestion The subjects thus began the experiment with the notion that it was a test in fineness of discrimination for weight The tests were made under the most favorable circumstances possible No one was permit ted to be present but the operator while the tests were being made in order to prevent especially in the case of the younger children any possible confusion or uunaturaness They were directed to lift each weight in the same way that is by taking them between the thumb and finger and liffing them straight up in order to prevent any physiological basis for a difference in sensations No more restrictions were placed upon them however than were necessary to insure the introduction of no error After the weights had been arranged in the order as they thought of their weight they wereAge I II III IV V VI nI VILI Comparative weightof 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 2 8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

the arrangement of tha order of eightweights A11 the weights which were judged to be the heaviest were recorded in the columns marked I those weights which were judged to be the ne2Ctlightestin the columns marked II and so on to those judged to be the lightest which was thus recorded in column VIII The Arabic numerals entered beneath in these columns represent the weights which were judged to belong in this order of weight Thus the figures 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 represent the weights in order of their size 1 represents the weight 1 inches ill length 2 represents the one 2 inches 3 the one 20 inchesn and so on up to 8 which represents the longest one 5 inches sn length So7 when the figures correspond with the Roman numerals at the head of the columns it means that their weight was judged to be in the inverse order of their size ThD smallest was Judged to be the heaviest and the largest the lightest In the columns marked comparative weight of the first and last of the seriest the figures are entered which repre sent the number of times the weight entered in column I was judged to be heavier than that entered in column VIII The figures representing any disarrangements of the weights in order of their size are printed in boldfaced type in order liat they may appear more distinct in the tables T7ze A e cresgement of the Wetg7tts A single glance at the tables is sufficient to see that more than half of the childrell arranged the weights in the ezact order of their size By actual count it will be found that ninetytwo out of 173 arranged them so artd that of all the others not one reversed them or even made an approach to a reversalt notwithstand ing it was supposed that with the younger children this would be the case Then the degree of the disarrangement is of much importance What is meant by degree of disar rangement in this connection can be best explained by taking a concrete example In the table marked Boys Class I the third boy has made the arrangement 5 4 2 1 3 6 82 7 here in this case weight 5 was judged to be the heaviest and so on in the order they occur Now it is plain that his arrangement is much more a departure from the norlnal than it would have been had he placed them so that the weights would in no case be aranged more than one place removed from the column in which it wollld be normally placed Instead of weight 5 being put in either column IV or VI which would be a displacement of the Jrst degree it is put in column I which makes it a displacement of the foutho DRESSLAR degree from the normal The degree of displacement then can always be found by finding the difference between the number of ths weight and the number at the head of the column in which it is placed It is easy to see that of all the displacements made by far the greatest number are only of the first degree In fact out of 287 the whole number of displacementsJ 218 were of the first order fiftyone were of ths second order thirteen of the third order fourteen of the fourth and one of the fifth This fact shows conclusively that without an exception each child arranged them under the influence of the illusion that their weight in a general way was inversely as their size This point will be touched again in the study of the results with special reference to the age of the children Comparison of the Weight of the Ftrst and Last of the Serzes In order to test the amount of the illusion produced after the weights had a11 been arranged as the sllbject thought in the order of their weight he was asked to judge in relative terms between the one he had placed as the heaviest and the one he had judged to be the lightest By referring to the table it can be seen that the illusion is quite large The Judgments of the compalative weights of the two vary from one and onethird to ten That is to SAYJ the weights in column I were judged to he as many times heavier than the ones ill column VIII as the figures indicate in the column marked comparative weight The average estimate of 172 children is that the weights placed in column I which was the smallest weight in all but twentyseven cases was three times heavier than those placed in column VIII which was the largest in all but twenty cases Before these tests were made on the children some prelimirlary Xsts had been made on adults and it was seen that these comparative judgments were likely to be larger when all of the weights were presented for arrangement than if only two the shortest and the longest were given That is the same weifflhts were judged to be nearer equal when they were presented without the intervening ones To make a thorough test of this inter esting diSerence 178 children of the same ages and as near as possible of the same intelligence as those to whom all were presented were given only the two estremes asked to arrange them in order of their weight and after this was done asked to state in relative terms7 their notion of their weights These last children not only did not see the inter vening weights but did not know that there were any The tables for these are not given simply because in all but two cases the shortest is put the heavier and the average of thecomparisons is 24 That is to say the smallest one irl direct comparison with the largest one uninfluenced by the sug gestion of the intervening onest was judged to be only 24 times the heavier It is quite clear then that we have in the case of the judgments when all the weights were presented a summation effect of the illllsion which therefore did not depend directly on the difference in the size of the two weights compared but on the suggestion caused by the previous judg ments in arranging the whole series That is to say the sub ject after having decided that weight one was heavier than two and two heavier than threeS and three heavier than four and so on through to eight would come to compare the weights one and eight with the notion built up that there was of neces sity much difference between them This illusion thus built up unconsciously is measured appro23imately by the differ ence between these two averages 3 and 24 which is6 This means that an illusion of seventynine grams was built up through this seriesy if the largest one be taken as the standard For since the weights all weighed 132 grams each the difference between these averages would give an addition of seventynine grams to the smallest If the smallest one can be taken as the standard then the largest one would be estimated seventynine grams too light It seems more natural to interpret this illusion in the latter way because the subjects all arranged the weights beginning with the heaviest and thus necessarily making it the standard frequently coming back to it indeed as a standard as they progressed in the arrangement of the series It is aJ legitimate question for the reader to ask for an assur ance of confidence in this difference between the averages Or better to ask for the probable errors of these mean results These probable errors have been calculated according to the rules givenbyJevonsl The error thus computed forthe comparisons when all the weights were presented is 06 that for the comparisons when only two weights were pre sented is 05 The meaning of this is that if any number of judgments be made under the same conditions onehalf of them will fall between 306 and 294 in the case of the judg ments when all of the weights were presented and between 245 and 235 in the case of the judgments when only the estremes were presented We have thus arrived at an approximate measure of the degree of credibility of the average which indicates the region for the truth to most likely hit upon The truth in this case being that if any number of judgments be made under the same conditionsS X See The Principles of Science W S Jevons p 387 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCEI 35t352 DRESSLAR onehalf of them would fall within the limits 294 and 306 when all the weights were presented and within the limits 235 and 245 when only the extremes were presented Since therefore there is a great gap between the approach ing extremes of these two sets of judgments we are warranted in asserting with a high degree of certainty that the signifi cant difference between the two averages is not an accidental one but represents a difference in the judgments based on some permanent difference in the psychological basis for the judgments This diSerence as we have said is due to the suggestion which came from the intervening judgments when all the weights were presented It was thought at first that there might be some relation between the size of this illusion and the least perceptible diflerence between weights of this heft for if the illusion which is measured by seventynine grams be divided by seven the number of comparisons made in arranging the weights the quotient would not be very far removed from the least discernible difference between weights of this heft were the hefts of those compared of equal ratios But the distribution of the errors shows that there is at least no dis cernible connectiono The question now arises how can this illusion be distrib uted throughout the series  This can be answered partially by noting the position in the series where the disarrange ments have been made It is evident that wherever the appareIlt difference in weight between the weights was greatest there would naturally occur less disarrangement from their order as to size and vace versa Then it must be borne in mind that as the weights increase in size the relative differ ence between adjacent weights when placed in order of their size decreases Thus the relative difference between the sizes of one and two is onethird while between seven and eight it is only oneninth From this relation alone we would have a right to expect fewer disarrangements near the begin ning of the series than we would near the end But since there are more disarrangements near the beginning as can be seen from a study of the tables the relatively greater differ ence in size of the first ones was more than counterbalanced by the suggestion which came when it was seen that the arrangement was probably in the order of their size It may be well to call attention here to what will be discussed more at length further on and that is the fact that records on fortyeight adults show the reverse to be true That is as we might expect from the difference in the relative sizes as the series progressed more disarrangements were made as this relative difference decreased353 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH Intettigence and Apperception In the description of the method it was stated that before any experiments were made on the children that their teachers divided them on paper into three classes with reference to their general intelligence class I including the brightest ones class II those consid ered good and class III the dullest This classification of course was wholly unknown to the children as has been said and so in no way would aflect their tests The purpose of this was tyvofold 1 To compare the strength of the associations of the three classes and note the infuence of these on the jtldgments and 2 to determine if there be any difference in the suggestibility of the three classes 1 The strength of the associations that have been made by the subjects between size and weight is found by a study of the arrangement of the weights In the first place no subject hesitated in deciding that there were differences in weight and that of quite a marked degr3e Indeed the illusion is so strong that it is impossible to rid ones mind of it even after one sees their weight is absolutely equal pro viding that lle perceives either through sight or tollch that there is a difference in tfheir size This last fact is a very striking illustration of the strength of a long continued and practically an unbroken series of associations Throughout our whole experience diflerence in weight is assoviated with diSerence in size and especially so when the weights to be judged are apparently of the same material as in this case When the weights were placed before the sllbject perhaps the first observation made was that they diSered in size and that some were much larger than others The nest idea which arose especially since the test of weight sensibility was involved was to the effect that the largest was the heaviest These ideas perhaps all arose in the mind of the subject before he had touched a weight so that when he began to lift them he would unconsciouslyb put forth effort in lifting them in proportion to their size as he had always been accustomed to do But as the weights were of equal heft they of course would respond the more readilyb to the lift as they were the larger and thus arose a basis for the illusion One would naturally suppose that after the weights hal been handled awhile that the illusion would fade away but on the contrary those subjects who took much time in the arrangement of them verv rarely failed to arrange them in the order of their size judging them to be lighler as they grew larger Indeed after having made them and worked with them for weeks fully conscious of the illusion a11 the time I could not rid myself of the idea that there was a striking difference in their weight when Idepended alone on what seemed to be my sensations Some of the adult subjects upon whom I myself experimented after being told refused to believe that they were of the same weight until they saw them weighed And even then could scarcely prevent themselves from discrediting the balances I have nowhere found a better illustratioll of the power of apperception or how our sensations are modified and trans formed by the ideas already in the mind than is brought out in these tests The stimulus in the case of each weight was exactly the same but the mental result for each weight was different That is to say were it not for the imposition of the associations previously formed the weights would have all appeared equal in their heft because the same amount of muscular effort would have sufficed in each case to lift the weights In Steinthals1 story of the party in the railway carriage all of whom were strangers to each other it is related that one member succeeded ill telling the occupation of each of the others by their spontaneous answers to the same question Here as in the weights the same stimulus was applied to each person but unlike the results in the case of the weights the responses were very different This brings out very clearly the fact that from the same stimulus different results arise for different people only in so far as the associations with the same special stimulus have diSered In the case of the weights it has been as has been said a universal almost an inborn association that of two or more weights of the same material the heft increases wlth the increase in size and so not onlywas the stimulus the same for each person but the sensations received were moulded and shaped under the influence of like associations in such a way that we get the same general results So while the doctrine of apper ception calls especial attention to the transorming influences brought about by the elements which the mind itself fur nishes the associatioll processes give the key to the influences thus brought to play upon the sensations 2 If the oregoing arlalysis be true then we would expect that the more intelligent the child the more likely he would be to arrange the weights inversely as their order in size For it would follow that those who have been the most discriminative not only for differences in weight but also for size and likeness of the material of which the bodies to be compared were composed have the strongest and there fore the most dominating connection between the two Ooming to a direct study of the tables for each of the tnree t See James quotation in his Psychology Vol II p 108 354 DRESSLAR355 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCE classes the trath of these statements is fully borne out The following table will assist in making this clear DRE OF D1SARRANGEMENT N

for the three classes of intelligence Each class is divided with reference to ses In class I there were thirty girls and twentytwo boys in clalss II thirty girls and fortyone boys in class III twentrythree girls and twentyeight boys In the whole set of tests there were only five grades of displace ment It will be seen that nearly all of the displacements are of the first degree That is they were only one place removed fromthe place they would occupy in the series were they all arranged in order of their size As the table indi cates there were 217 displacements of the first degree fifty one of the second thirteen of the third five of the fourth and one of the fifth In the ne2at column will be found the num ber of displacements and in the ne2at the average number of displacements for each child for each class It will not only be noticed that of all the displacements for each class there are relatively more displacements of the first degree in class I than in class II and more in class II than in class III but especially it will be seen that the average number of dis placements per child increases as the grade of intelligence decreases so that it happens that the absolute number of displacements for fiftytwo of the brightest children is fifty eight while fiftyone of the dullest make 105 displacements making the average in the latter case double that of the former In accordance with this result one would have a right to expect a still smaller number of displacements when the tests were made on adults And this is exactly what happens The number of displacements for fortyeight adults is only fortyfour making the average but 9 of one displacement See the table of records on adults page 358 Dzffierence wtth Segawad to Sex Here again we might expect to find that differences in the strength of the associa tions would assert themselves Since boys have to do ia356 DRESSLAR their experience with size and weight relations much more than do girlsX we would e2mpect their associations to be stronger between these two contiguous ideas This is what we find to be true though in no very striking degree Eow ever by observing the preceding table it will be seen that the average number of displacements is less for the boys than for the girls in classes I and III and equal to them in class II By finding the average number of displacements for a11 of the boys and all of the girls when the whole series of weights was given it is found that this average for the boys is 15 while it is 17 for the girls Though this special diflerence is not at all marked it is worth noticing The chief diiierence between the judgments of the boys and girls however is shown in the diiierence between the comparisons of the first and last of the series when a11 the weights were presented and when only two were presented The average for the girls when all were presented is slightly larger than the same Ior the boys as is also their probable error show ing that while the girls have a distinet notion that there is a diSerence in weight they have not a distinot notion of what this supposable difference is But when it comes to a com parison of the averages of their estimates when only two were presented there is a much wider difference MThen only the two weights were presented the boys judged the small one to be twice as heavy as the large one while the girls made an average estimate that it was 24 times as heavy This brings out plainlysince the probable errors of these means are quite smallthat the boys were more intiuenced by the suggestion than the girls when al the weights were presented and so in line with the fact brought out previously in the paper that those with the stronger associations of weight and size relations were the most suggestible as shown by the size of their estimates of their coraparative weights Dewece with Regard to Age The 173 children upon whom tests were made for the whole series of weights were about equally distributed for the various ages from seven to fourteen inclusive It was e2rpected that there would appear quite a difference between the disarrangements of the weights for the two extremes of age as well as in the comparative judgInents of the two weights But this is not what llappened in either case the diiBerence in each case is too slight to point to any real diiierence between the ideas of the two for weight and size relationship However since only about twenty of each age were tested no definite statement can be made with reference to what would appear if more were t ested This lack of diSerence between the records of357 PSYCEOLOGY OF TOUCH children seven and fourteen years of age indicates that the relationship of the ideas in question is about as definite other things being equal at seven as at fourteen But this result with respect to age will only be of value as an indica tion of what aan now be better determined It seems unnecessary to give the special table here upon which these statements are based for they can be verified froln the general tables previously given Just here it might be mentioned that in the whole number of children tested no less than thirteen nationalities are represented The fathers of fortyeight per cent were born in the IJnited States twelve per cent in Germany eight per cent in Sweden eight per cent in Denmark Sve per cent in England four per cent in Canadas three per cent in Bohemia two per cent in Norway and the rsmaining ten per cent distributed about equally in Austria Ireland France Russia India and The Netherlands Tests on Xdutts The tests recorded in th following tabl were taken before the work was done with the school chil dren alld from this work the method was partially developed and completed It may be of interest and value to say that the records here recorded were made on subjects of various occupations including a number of specialists in psychology pedagogy and mathematics as well as druggists mechanics grocers and those generally whose occupation would lead them to be discriminative with reference to weight and size By glancing at the accompanying table it can readily be seen that there are fewer disarrangements for adults than for children In the whole number of adults which is forty eight there are but fortyfour displacements thus making an average of 9 of one displacement for each subject But especially ought it to be noticed that all of these displace ments are made by thirteen subjects and that thirtyfive of them or more than seventytwo per cent made no displace ment at all from the order of their size It should be borne in mind that throughout this whole research with the children as well as with the adults one judgment not in accordance with the order of the size means in nearly a11 cases two dis placements Suppose weight four was judged to be heavier than three and so arranged there would of necessity be two displacements according to the method used If it were possible to make sure of the number ofX judgments used in all the displacements it would be beGer to compare on the basis of these But this is not always possibe and so the other method has been used If there be any preference for either class in the method used it has been to make the difference358 DRESSLAR less marked between them by an esaggeration of the judg ments of the most intelligent not in accordance with the order of size So therefore if such a method could be used it would only accentuate more decidedly the correctness of the results obtained by our study of the records Comparative

previously described The method was the same in the two cases except for the first seventeen adults who were not asked at first to make a statement in comparative terms of the weight of the first and last of their series At this point in the work the idea occurred for it had become evident that the illllsion was quite marked and that by this means I could get a measure of it With the rest of the subjects all of whom were males but two the comparison is given Let us first look at the arrangement of the weights A glance is sufficient to show that there are much fewerdisplacements in this table than in those with the children True it is that the twentytwo boys in class I have made a smaller aarerage of displacements but the probability is that if a greater number of these had been tested their average woud have been larger Another difference between the displacements for the children and the adults has been mentioned previously this is the difference of position in the series where the displacements occllr The following table will make this clear Speaking generally it is seen that the children make more displacements at the beginning of the series than toward the last while just the opposite is true for the adults This latter as has been pointed out is TABLE SHOWINGt THE DISTRIBUTION OF DISPLACEMENT8 NO I II III IV V VI VII VIII  GSir1S 30 3 7 7 5 7 6 4 1 I g  BOYS 22 2 4 5 1

ratio of the sizes of adjacent weights But this difEerence is not very striking and more records are necessary before any conclu sions can be drawn from them By far the mvst interesting difference that came out of the records of the children and those for adults is the greater difference which adults lnake360 DRESSLAR in the comparisons of the two weights when all were pre sented and when only the first and last were presented The averages of the estimates when all the weights were presented is two and sistenths while that when only two were given is one and fivetenths The probable errors of these means are very small and thus render the result in a high degree credible 1 In brief the results on adults show a11 the eflects of more firmly fised associations and hence a greater degree of sug gestibility in the direction of these associations as well as the greater influence of these in dominating and transforming the sensations directly received That is to say we are unable in this case to ascribe any definite value to the actual muscular sensations simply because the preconceived notions in the mind determined and fited by all of our previous experience render us unable to determine the truth in such conditions This is a good illustration of what might be called uncon scious dogmatism 2 On the Influence of Shape on the Judgtnent of a Serzes of Weights of Equal WetyAt and Stze A series of tests was made on seventeen adults with weights of the same wetght and stze but of difierent shape to determine if this suggestion of diflerence in weight would pre vail according to apparent diflerence in size Eight weights were made of sheet lead a11 of the same area and weight but varied in shape from a circle to an irreg ular cornered figure The table below shows that the weights which appear smaller that is are of a compact form were judged to be heavier than those not so compact While the preference7 of course is not nearly so uniform as it was for the brass weights the averages of the numbers rep resenting the order in which they were placed show a de cided preference It will be seen by reference to the table that those weights which are judged to be the lightest are those whose form makes them appear the largest of the series It should be noted here that when the weights were taken into the hands rather than grasped by the fingers there was furnished a basis for a difference in the sensations of weight due to the fact that those more compact in form for e2iample the circle eserted the same pressure on more closely related iSince my work was completed my attention has been called to some experiments made by Charpentier who used two brass balls of different size but of the same weight He found the same illu sion the larger seeming the lighter His balls weighed 266 grams each but the larger was judged to be sistysis grams lighter than the smaller Elements de la Sensation de Poids Archives de Phys iotogie Serie 6 Tome 3 p t26361 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH and fewer pressure spots than those whose form was more irregular The subjects were carefully observed on this point and very few of them permitted the introduction of this dis turbing physiological element Even when the weights were taken into the hands the decision was almost invariably ren dered after a balancing of the two coInpared by grasping them between the fingers The avoidance of this physiolog ical cause for illusion went so far with one subject L that he tied strings to the weights and then lifted them by the strings Nevertheless his record corresponds very closely to the general result No experiments were purposely made either with the brass weights or the lead weights when the subjects were blind folded because it was thought that such a method would of necessity introduce much more strongly this probably disturb ilag physiological element which was otherwise almost wholly eliminated even when the subjects wrere not directed how to lift the weights but left to use their own method as was the case with the adults It was of course wholly useless and unnecessary with either series of weights to take a series of e2rperiments when the elements of size and form were both eliminated and the weight for each remained the same OO WS j A 1 5 3 2 7 8 6 4 B 4 1 2 5 6 3 8 7 CD 1 3 2 4 5 8 7 6 D 2 4 1 3 5 6 8 7 E 3 4 2 1 6 5 8 7 F 7 5 3 1 2

the first row of figures is the order wvhich A judged them as to weight the second is Bs order etc It will be noticed that the weights are arranged in the table in the order they were judged on the average But it must not be inferred from this arrangment that they were presented to the subjects in this or any other order They wvere placed before the subject in a haphazard way and the subject left to separate and arrange them according to his onvn method Conctusions 1 The more intelligent the children other thints being equal the stronger are the associations between the ideas of size and weight of a given material 2 The stronger this associative element becomes the more likely it is to dominate and pervert the true sensations when the conditions are such that these associations do not hold 3 The elements the mind furnishes keeping these condi tions have far more iniluence in determining the judgment than the sensations directly received 4 Illusions are easily built up when suggested along the lines of firmly fi2red associations 5 Consequently the brightest children are more suggesti ble under these conditions than the dullest ones 6 The method used in this research furnishes a means of measuring suggested illusions of this type 7 Adults have stronger associations between the ideas in question than children and despite the fact that they have av higher degree of sensibility for difference in weight their sen sations are more transformed and iniluenced by the element which the mind itself furnishes than are those of children 8 Facts which vary within limits from our establislled habits of apperception are simply not taken account of at a11 or if on some occasion the conditions force us to see how our minds have become insulated against the reception of different relations we do so with a wholly new feeling of personal fallibility 9 The pedagogical significance of the facts emphasized in this research is of the utmost importance It has to do with one of the most fundamental laws which regulate our mental life The foregoing tests as a whole show how strong and dominating an association between ideas may become when they are practically unseparated and immediate in their sequence  That which the law of gravitation is to astronomy 2 Says John Stuart Mill  that which the elemen363 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH tary properties of the tissues are to physiology the law of the association of ideas is to psychology V Minor Observations Reversat of Certain Cutaneous Sensations of Motion The wvellknown  waterfall  illusion for vision or as it is more scientifically called the antirheoscopic illusion suggested that perhaps the same illusion might occur in case of the skin if practically the same conditions were complied with that is if the skin were stimulated rapidly and regularly in a continuous direction comparable to the stimulus given to the retina by the steadly falling water or the moving stripes onthe antirhtsoscope To do this a frame was made suffl ciently large to allow the arm to be placed in it At each end of the frame a roller was placed and over these a belt of plaited velvet was fastened One of the rollers was furnished with a crank so that by turning this the skin could be stimu lated with the moving folds of the velvet regularly and con tinuously in whatever direction desired The folds in the velvet belt were about threefourths of an inch in depth and one and onefourth inches apart Experience proved that these folds need to be made carefully and directly across the belt with no irregularities in them at all otherwise the stimu lation becomes too comples and the resulting after sensation mised and indistinct Care needs to be taken too that as far as possible the velvet must be kept of the same temperature as the arm for if not it will absorb the heat of the arm so readily as to swamp all other sensations in that of tempera ture The folds of the velvet need to be pressed sufficiently hard against the skin so as to make the sensations of each fold clear cut and distinct Having as nearly as possible sat isfied these conditions I tried the apparatus first on two women both of whom were wholly ignorant of the purpose of the e2rperiment and knew nothing of the illusion for vision I simply asked each one to give attention to the sensations caused by the moving velvet and after it was stopped to notice carefully any sensations that might then come out dif ferent to those perceived while the belt was in motion The result was that each one immediately said  I feel the motion as if the belt were moving backward Of course these trials were made so that the results of the experiment on one were unknown to the other Afterward I tried it upon myself and Dr Sanford and though each of us was some what skeptical as to the nature of the results something like backward motion was experienced It was tried for the lover arm lengthwise and crosswise and in both directions for thepalm of the hand and for the forehead For myself the clearest results were obtained on the sole of the bared foot This sensation for reversed motion is not so clear and dis tinct for touch as it is in the case of vision as would naturally be supposed for our attention is so much less frequently directed toward sensations for touch than for sight that we are unable to concentrate it so carefully and easily Althollgh this experiment shows that the illusion in ques tion can be produced in touch as well as in visicn no com pletely satisfactory explanation can be given The foLowing suggestions however may have something of truth in them and I give them merely for what they are worth Stimulation of any part of the body immediately causes a greater flow of blood to that part and especially do the smaller blood vessels become congested when the skin is stimulated with friction as in the case of the foregoing ezrper iment Then as the folds of the velvet are swept over the skin there is a tendency for the blood to be forced along in the capillaries in the direction of the moving belt and when the actual motion stopped to flow back again to restore the equilibrium in the vascular pressure The rush of the blood to the face in blushing which is very noticeable and the direction of the wave quite marked will illustrate in a magni fied degree what takes place in the skin 1lnder the conditions of the experiment This view is in harmony with the fact that the sensation of reversal for touch as for sight is imme diate quickly dies out and does not return again as other afterimages I am aware that the view here taken seems much more reasonable for touch than for sight and yet the changes in circulation caused by the hastened metabolic processes in the eye brought about by such stimulation may suffice to re stimulate the retinal elements of vision in a reverse order to that of the direct stimulus and thus furnish a basis for the illusion AftewImages of Touch and Summatson of Stzmutz Dr Alfred Goldscheiderl has called attention to the fact that if one touches the skin with a moderately sharp pointed instrll ment the first sensation arising therefrom is a pricking sensation which soon dies away but after this sensation has disappeared a second sensation arises which retains some thing of the pricking sensation but has lost the quality of touch which was prominent in the first He found by further  A G5oldscheider Ueber die Summation vontEautreizen Du Bois Reymonds Archiv 1891 p 161 364 DRESSLAR365 PSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH experiment that if the primary sensation approached very near to a painful sensation the secondary sensation became distinctly painful while if the primary itself became painful the secondary sensation vas less distinct It was found how ever that if the skin be stimulated with a single electric stimulus the secondary sensation did not come out It was found that in order to arouse this secondary sensation it re quired a number of electrical stimuli made on the same spot A series of four stimulations gave a clear secondary sensation only on condition that certain intervals between the stimuli be retained That is to say the sensation was most marked with intervals between tbe stimulations of from 03 to 06 seconds If the intervals were varied above or below these limits the secondar3r sensation became less and less distinct until it gradually disappeared For the purpose of testing these results I first made some small penciis of cork gave one each to a number of subjects all in the same room and all students of psychology and asked them to touch their hands with these points and note carefully their sensations allowing several seconds to elapse between the separate touches I did not tell them what to e2mpect but simply to describe careflllly their sensations Goldscheiders work was known however to a part of them at least The following are a few of the results obtained and are practically the same as those on a number of other sub jects 1A A more or less ticklish sensation much like that of a mosquito bite that has nearly disappeared at first came out Some time after when I supposed that all sensation had disappeared a sharp somewhat painful sensation flashed out and disappeared nearly aS suddenly But after quite a period of time in fact after writing the above description it appeared again but with less foree each time until it com pletely died away 2B At first a sense of contact and then a sense of pres sure These were both accompanied by a sensation of tem perature On touching my hand again somewhat more vigor ously I find that the demarkation between the sensations of touch and pain is much more definite than I thought it to be I noticed no aftersensations at all In later experiments however this subject had distinct aftersensations 3C  A fter touching my hand with the cork in addition to the feeling of contact in about onehalf of the cases there came a distinct secondary sensation of a more or less painful character and diffused over a greater area than the primary sensatioxi In the cases where the primary sensation was366 DRESSLAR somewhat painful the aftersensations did not come out so clearly 4D After touching the back of my hand the first time as an aftereffect there arose a slight drawing sensation the second trial I struck my hand a little too hard so that the first sensation was slightly painful Later a sharp fine sen sation somewhat extended but chiefly located about an inch nearer the wrist and somewhat toward the little finger side came as an afterefEect This was very distinct both in quality and place from the slight pain resulting immediately from the stroke In the third trial the pressure was slight 3nd the sensation of a sticking character and seemingly not so fleeting as in the other cases it faded slowly but not regu larly and seemed to recur several times In the fourth trial the touch was again very light and the afterimage was clear and somewhat irradiated I noticed that the afterimages of former touches returned and rendered this last sensation somewhat vague From the above results it is clear that afterimages of touch are easily recognized and that these are of a more or less painful character even though the primary sensation itself contain no element of pain My results of which only sam ples are given are in accord with those obtained by Gold scheider for touch I did not repeat his experiments with electrical stimulation to obtain the summation eflects but I found that this afterimage could be much sharpened and enforced by the effects of tickle After experimenting some time on this afterimage effect it seemed that the clearness and vigor of its efEect were due largely to the plethoric condi tion of the part stimulated That is to say when the hand for exalmple wals cold or hald been resting passively the after image from a given touch wals much less malrked thaln when the hand was full of blood and the attention directed toward it It occllrred to me that the tickle sensations might serve to reinforce and bring out more distinctly this aftereffect Accordingly on many naive subjects I first made experiments to determine the normal strength of the afterimage before tickle and then in a short time stimulated the surface thoroughly by tickling The result in most cases was a distinctly marked increase in the clearness and vigor of the afterimage especiallsr in its painful qualitsr No difference was noticeable however in the quality or quantity of the primary sensation It would seem then that increase in sen sitiveness for direct touch could not be assigned as the whole cause Furthermore I came to see that the rush of blood to the spot pressed after the cork point had been removed coincided in time exactly with the recurrence of the aftersenPSYCHOLOGY OF TOUCH 367 sastion and in my own case asnd even with other subjects I could determine precisely when the aftersensation would flash out by simply watching the rush of blood to the spot touched Now it is clear that this rush of blood is the chief and so fasr as I can distinguish the only direct stimulasting agent for the production of this asftersensation Just how this is done is an entirely diiierent thing It may be that the temporary lack of blood in the caspillasries at the point touched caused by the pressure of the cork point was sufficient to permit asn amount of metlabolism of the part great enough so that when the blood returned and the opposite process was started the tosic agents released acted directly on the deli cate adjascent nerve tendrilsn and the result was the aftersensa tion This view seems the more probable when it is remem bered that the aftersensastion contains invariasbly a painful element alld none of touch or contaset It may be and proba bly is true thast also the minute tissues of the pasrt are slightly ruptured and the return of the blood to these would thus restimulalte the adjacent nerves more sharply than the origina stimulus and hence the feeling of pain Whether this view be correct or not the falet still remalins that the return of the blood to the point stimulalted is simultaneous with the after sensation Goldscheiderns theory that this summation stim ulus is probably due to the hindrance and the reinforcing of the stimulus in the cellular tissues which are spread out along the nervous tract and in connection with it seems to me to go needlessly into difflculties Dermographtsm Dermographism or skin writing is said to be dependent on two causes an irritable nervous system and some tosic agent Both of these conditions become causes which may act either on the peripheral vasomotor nerves or on the vasomotor centre and so influence directly the circulation The foregoing is about what the physicians say of this But it is very easy to obtain upon perfectly healthy subjects In order to test this after having found it true for myself I asked a class of ten men to write with moderately blunt pieces of cork on their lower arms the word bZood and then slightly rub the arm This was done and the word in each case came out in flaming red letters after a pause of a few seconds In some cases there was left a welt where the cork passed over the skin after the increase of the blood had died away although the writing with the cork was done very lightly and gave no sensations of scratch illg368 DRESSLAR The studies here described were made during the present academic year at Clark TJniversity under the immediate

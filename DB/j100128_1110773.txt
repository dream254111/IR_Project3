franchise has been considered merely a means for promoting the good of the state and for effectually securing the socalled natural rights such as those to life and liberty2 the creation and preservation of which is the ultimate end of govern ment3 Since it is not in itself one of those rights4 the franchise has always been held subject to regulation and limitation by the conven tional power5 and in this country the theory of the Federal Constitu tion seems to bear out this conception of its nature as altogether con ventional and derivative6 It is true that the National Legislature has been given power to regulate congressional elections and its regula tions are paramount7 for the right to vote at such elections depends primarily on the Constitution of the United States rather than on the laws of the States8 The only source of Federal control over purely State elections on the other hand is the Fifteenth Amendment9 which forbids the enactment by Congress or the States of any law depriving a citizen of his right to vote by reason of race color or previous condition of servitude10 It is to be observed that while this amend ment gives exemption from all discrimination on the grounds specified it does not restrict the operation of general laws nor confer suffrage upon any one1 Subject then to these limitations it would seem that the States since they are held to have reserved to themselves all authority not clearly granted to the general government must in their sovereign capacity have plenary power over the elective franchise12 and instances of the exercise of this power are to be found in all the State constitutions8 When qualifications for the voter are therein prescribed they are held to be exclusive and are not subject to be restricted extended or altered by the Legislature4 which however is not precluded from enacting laws to secure the proper exercise of the franchise and to preserve it inviolatel5 These laws must of course Gougar v

Supervisors supra 278be reasonable and impartial and such as do not tend to deny or abridge the suffrage nor unnecessarily to impede its exercisel0 In accord ance with this principle registration laws have been very generally held valid17 on the ground that they are regulations merely which do not prescribe any new or different qualifications beyond those fixed in the constitution and which are indispensable to the purity of elections The right of suffrage carries with it necessarily the right to make the vote effective and to cast it on equal terms with every other voter Just so far therefore as the full efficiency of the individual vote depends on party organization party organization is a constitutional right18 though it is otherwise as to mere political fealtyl1 and similarly wherever a nomination is legally or practically a condition precedent to an election there is a right to share in the selection of candidates20 With the introduction of the Australian ballot system the extent of the legislative power to control parties and nominations as dis tinguished from the individual franchise became an important ques tion The practical considerations calling for such regulation are to be found in the necessity for restricting the ballot to a workable size and for this purpose laws were everywhere passed limiting the number of candidates by providing substantially that a political party failing at a primary to poll a specified percentage of the total vote at the last preceding general election should not have the names of its candidates on the ballot in a party column but only in the list of independent nominations21 These statutes which it should be noted do not directly affect the right to cast the individual ballot though contested as instances of unwarrantable discrimination between politi cal parties have nevertheless been sustained under the police power as regulations essential to the practical operation of the Australian ballot in spite of the desirability under the new system of furthering and preserving party policies In a recent case State ex rel McGrael v Phelps Wis 1910 128 N W 1041 the court was called upon to determine the constitutionality of a statute somewhat similar to those last mentioned It was therein provided that a political party all of whose candidates in the aggregate should fail at a primary election to poll for any given official district or division twenty per cent of the vote cast by such party for governor in such district or division at the last preceding general election should have the names of its can didates upon the ballot only in the column of independent nominations Although in view of the foregoing exception must be taken to the courts contention that the right to vote protected as it is by the State con stitution is furthermore a natural or inherent right nevertheless the result of the decision in sustaining the statute under the police power as a valid regulation of the size of the ballot seems clearly correct however unwise the policy of the law Cooley Constitutional Limitations 907 Capen v Foster Mass 1832 12 Pick 485 Cooley Constitutional Limitations 9o2 see also Pope

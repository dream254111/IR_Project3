j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099620,Contempt Libelous Publication after Decision Rendered,i245891,CONTEMPTLIBELOUS PUBLICATION AFTER DEcIsIoN RENDEREDThe case of Ex parte Lawrence and Canfield 34 Chicago Legal News 132 decided Dec 7 1901 by the Circuit Couirt of Cook county Illinois presents certain remarkable facts and we are inclined to think certain equally remarkable law It was an application for a writ of habeas corpus by the proprietor and editor of a Chicago newspaper to obtain their release from a sentence of thirty and forty days re spectively in the county jail imposed by a coordinate court for contempt of court The facts were briefly that relators had published a libelous article concerning and a cartoon of the Hon Elbridge Hanecy judge of the Circuit Court of Cook county based upon a decision which he had rendered in a case of great popular interest Judge Hanecy directed that an information be filed against the pro prietor and editor for the alleged contempt and in their answer thereto they acknowledged their responsibility for the publication and authorship of the offensive matter but denied that they had intended to influence prejudice or terrorize the court with reference to its decision for the specific reason that the case in question was decided on the day before the publication of the article As a matter of fact while Judge Hanecy had read a written opinion disposing of the legal questions involved in the case and had in open court stated that  the order of August 9 1901 is set aside and the petition and the information are dismissed no formal order was entered on that day or before the publication of the article The respondents in that court urged however that this was a final decision of the entire questiona complete determination of the entire controversy quoud that courtand they argued that they were therefore at liberty to comment on the decision in the manner charged Judge Dunne also of the Circuit Court of Cook county who issued the writ of habeas corpus to ascertain the legality of the convictions for contempt affirms in a long opinion first his power to inquire into the jurisdiction of a coordinate court to enter a final order of commitment in a contempt case Ile then rules citing Black on Judgments Vol 1 sec 106 and Freetnan on Judgments 2d ed sec 38 that the language used by Jtudge Hanecy in open court in dismissing the first cause was equivalent toinideed was the final order in the proceeding1902 NOTES OF CASES 653 though not entered by the clerk the action of the clerk in such case being always merely ministerial and that being so under the doctrine of contempts as laid down in Illinois in the case of Storey v The People 79 Ill 45 the relators had a right to comment upon and criticize the decision  even to the extent of libeling the honored and respected judge who rendered the opinion without ex posing themselves to prosecution for contempt of court Judge Dunne bases his ruling upon certain cases deeided by the Supreme Court of Illinois construing its constitutional provision that  every person may freely speak write and publish on all subjects being responsible for the abuse of that liberty etc He concludes his opinion as follows P ublic officials executive legislattive and judicial have always been and always will be subject to criticism because of their official acts It is one of the incidents and bur dens of a public life  If the criticism be just it will commend itself to the public and be effective for good If it be unjust and unfair it will fail to injure the man assailed  There is no good reason why a judge should have a different law applied to him than is applied to a president a governor or a member of the legislature  Editorial lawyers who gather their law from the circulation department or the counting room have diflered and will continue to differ with judges who obtain their law and inspiration from law books and legal precedents But there is no good reason why after the judge has given his exposition of the law and disposed of the case before him such an editorial lawyer may not decide the same case to suiit himself It is only when he forestalls the judge with his opinion and en deavors in his paper to coerce intimnidate terrorize wheedle or cajole the judge into agreeing with his newspaper law that his conduct by any possible construc tion of the Illinois decisions can become contempt of court  It is not without some reluctance that I feel constrained to differ so radically with the able and honorable jurist whose order has committed the relators to jail beca e of the undeserved assault upon him and because of my respect and friendship for him But such considerations must give way before the vital prin ciple involved in the protection of free speech and free press a principle so important that it has been carefully and zealously guarded by the constitution of our State and tlle constitution of the United States and the well considered decisions of our own Supreme Couirt I am clearlv of the opinioni that the language used in open court by Judge Hanecy on October 28 1901 amounted to a final order disposing of the case under consideration and that being a final order uinder the doctrine of Contempts as laid down in this State by our Supreme Court in Storey v Thte People that the relators had a righit to comment aud criticize that decision even to the extent of libeling the honored and respected judge who rendered the opinion without exposing tlhemselves to prosecution for contempt of court The decision really went off upon the point that the first case was no longer pending and while we confess that it and the legitimate deductions that may be made from it are somewlhat startling we must concede that there is a formidable arlav of authority for that view and little if any contra The following state ment of the law is made in 7 Am  Eng Enc Law 2d ed page 61 A slanderous and libelous

publication may be it lacks that necessary ingre dient to constitute a contempt of tending to prejudice the cause or to itmpede its progress Citing Ex parte Barry 85 Cal 603 20 Am St Rep 248 Story v

State v Kiser 20 Oregon 50 Bayard v Passmore 3 Yeates Pa 438 But in State v llforrill 16 Ark 384 the publication held to be a contempt was made after the de termination of the cause We purpose examining in a later number the question from the standpoint of Carters Case 96 Va 791 and from that of section 3768 of the Code of Virginia While the point did not arise in Carters Case there are several expressions and quotations in the opinion of the court which are most significant in the foregoing connection The question in regard to the provisions of the Code is whether they are a substitute for or only supplementary to the common law Since the foregoing note was prepared we have observed in the National Corpo ration Reporter of Chicago an interesting and extended criticism of the use made by Judge Hanecy in his opinion in the contempt case referred to and by the Su preme Court of Virginia in Carter v Com 96 Va 806 of the quotation from Chief Justice Wilmots celebrated opinion in Rex v Aimon It appears that this opinion was never delivered by Wilmot buit was foiund among his papers after his death and was published posthumously An extract from the Reporters article is ap pended  Whatever of evanescent fame accompanies the great judges of the world there are some of their expressions which carry the element of immortality with them This may be truly said of Wilmots opinion in Rex v Almon written in 1765 and which was the piece de resistance in Judge Hanecys opinion in the now famous contempt case leveled against Hearsts Chicago American and its employes This opinion was published in 23 Nat Corp Rep 426 to which reference is made The citationi made by Judge Hanecy was evidently copied from the opinion of the Court of Appeals of Virginia in State v Carter 96 Va 806  The Virginia courts reference to the famnouis passage of Wilmot is to Volumne 3 of Campbells Lives of the Chief Justices where the extract will be folund on page 190 Lord Campbell pointed out the fact of the nondelivery of Wilmots opinion on page 189 as follows I shall further only give a short extract from a judgment whichi he had written but which was not delivered in a case in which there was a smtimary application to the Court of Kings Bench for an attachment against a bookseller Almon who had published a pamphlet reflecting severely on Lord Mansfield and other judges of the court for their conduct in libel pros ecution instituted by the Crown 1 In examining the full judgment as published in Wilmots opinions London 1802 a note will be found p 243 as follows This opinion was not delivered  The powerwhich the courts in Westminster Hall have of vindicating theirown authority is coeval with their first foundation and institution it is a necessary incident to every court of justice whether of record or not to fine and imprison for a contempt committed in the face of the court and the issuing of attachments by the Supreme Court of Justice in WestminsterHall for contempts out of court stands on the same immemorial usage which supports the whole fabric of the common law  it is as much lex terrac and within the exception of Magna Charta as the issuiing of any other legal process whatsoever I have examined very carefully to see if I could find out any vestiges of its introduction but can find none It is as ancient as any other part of the common law there is no priority or posteriority to be found about it ie cannot therefore be said to evade the common law it acts in alliance and friendly conjunction with every other provision which the wisdom of our ancestors has established for the general good of society Truth compels me to say that the mode of proceeding by attachment stands upon the very same foundation as trial by jury it is a constitutional remedy in particular cases and the judges in those cases are as much bound to give an activity to this part of the law as to any other1902 NOTES OF CASES 655 in Court the prosecution having been dropped in cotmpliance it is supposed of the resignation of the then Attorney General Sir Fletcher Norton but it was thoughlt to contain so much legal knowledge on an imnportant subject as to be wortily of being preserved    p 244 As these proceedings were after wards dropped they are not mentioned in the reports of this period but it appears that this opinion was prepared after the argument on the rule to sshew cause as it takes notice of the arguiments of counsel anid of the objection made to the grant ing of the attachment But as the matter never came to a final decision it must be considered onlv as the opinion of the judge who gives it  Lord Campbell Volume 3  Lives of the Clhief Justices of England adds the following significant note on page 190 Rex v Almon Wilmot Op 243 In consequence of the resignation of Sir Fletcher Norton wlho as Attorney General had male the mrotion it was dropped after cause shown while the court was con sidering of its juidgment and although there can be no doubt as to the power to proceed by attachrnent in such a caseif a prosecution for libel on judges be necessarythe preferable course is to proceed by information or indictment so as to avoid placing them in the invidious situation of deciding where they may be supposed to be parties It will thus appear that when the Supreme Court of Virginia and Judge Elbridge Hanecy of the Cook Circuit Coturt cited the extract from Wilmots undelivered opinion in Rex v Almon it is most likely that the citation was ventured upon without the knowledge that tlhev were quoting not from a jiudlg ment of the court but from an undelivered opinion written in 1765 when the King was supposed to be the fountain of every species of Justice which is administered in this Kingdom And as Chief Justice Wilmot further stated p 255 The King is  de jure to distribute jutstice to all his subjects and because he cannot do it himself to all persons he delegates his power to his Judges who have the ctustody and guard of the Kings Oath  Sit in the Seat of the Kinig conl cerning his Justice  Just near the place where the Virginia Court of Appeals and Judge Hanecy stopped with their quotation may be found another view of the judiciary which in the course of 136 years has lost somewhiat of its regal glory Wilmot continues to expatiate The Arraignment of the Justice of the Judes is arraigning the Kings Justice it is an Impeachment of his wisdom and goodness in the choice of his Juidges and excites in the minds of the People a general Dissatisfaction with all Judicial Determinations and indisposes their mines to obey tlhem and whenever menis Allegiance to the Laws is so fuindatnentally slhaken it is the most fatal and imost dangerotus obstruction of Justice and in my opinion calls out for a more rapid and imtmediate Redress than aniy other Obstruiction whatsoever etc Lord Campbell was undotubtedly well aware of the entire text of the Wilmot opinion but he did not hesitate wheni writing the  Lives of the Chief Justices to record his opinion that in suclh cases the preferable course is to proceed by informationi or indictrnent so as to avoid placing the Judges in the invidious situiation of deciding where they may be supposed to be larties This celebrated opinion of Lord Chief Justice Wilmot of the Court of Com mon Pleas has often been looselv cited in aid of modern contempt proceedings whichi had an entirely different aspect The occasion was as follows Mr J Almnon the keeper of a bookshops in Picca dilly was charged with publishing a pamphlet containing alleged libelous passages uipon the Court of Kings Bench and upon Lord Mansfield the Chief Juistice charging him with having introduiced a method of proceeding to deprive the subject of the Kting of the benefit of the Habeas Corpuis Act The Chief Juistice was not even named in the pImphl t which was entitled A Letter Con cerning Libels Warrantts Seizuire of Papers etc printed for J Almon Picca dilly 1765 This pamphlet was the hasis for a motion by Attorney General Sir Fletclher Norton nade in the Kings Bench for an attachment against Mr Almon and a rule issuied for contermpt One of the passagfes in the pampllet was directed against Lord MIansfields action in permitting an amendmenit of an infor mation against the famotus Johnt Wilkes 17271797 and it was said thereini that the amendment was made officiously arbitrarily and illegally It is worthy to656 7 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Jan record here en passant that notwithstandinig this libel of Wilkes it fell to the lot of Mansfield three years later to reverse the judgment of outlawry against Wilkes on which occasion the Chief Justice spoke of that mendax infamria from the press which daily coins false facts and false motives These various extracts have been reproduced in order to show the general consensus of statemnent that Chief Justice Wilmots opinion in King v Almon was an undelivered paper and published only after his death It is awarding to him an immortalitv which he never dreamed of when he penned his opinion and it is somewhat of an anachroniism to see it quoted as authority in some of the Armerican courts at the close of the last and the beginning of the new century It is needless to say however that the decision in the Virginia case of Carter v Commonwealth 96 Va 791 is not at all dependent on the Wilmot opinion in Rez v Almon since in the Virginia case the contempt consisted Inot in a libelous publication reflecting upon the court but occurred in the face of the court in the shape of a telegram by the defendant to his counsel alleging his serious illness and consequetnt inability to be present at the trial of a case pending against him with the intent that the telegram slhould be shown to the court and a continuance thereby obtained and With the result that the telegram was used by his counsel the latter acting in good faith for that purpose

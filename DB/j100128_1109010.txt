charity is not void at the outset for indefiniteness See Baptist Assn v Harts Executors I819 4 Wheat I and App n i Fontain v Rave nel I854 I7 How U S 369 interpreting statutory jurisdiction of equity though apparently contra is difficult to support Under the Massachusetts statute Rev St 1902 ch 147  6 giving the newly appointed trustee the same powers and duties    as if he had been originally appointed it has been held that a discre tion to withhold the income is not to be considered as a personal confidence in the original trustee Wemyss v Whzie I893 I59 Mass 484 486 On the other hand for

ground that the owner has a right of property in such mark Bass c Co v Feiganspan I899 96 Fed 206 Browne on TradeMarks  32350 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 8o and if he can show an infringement of this right an injunction issues without territorial limitation Derringer v Plate I865 29 Cal 293 Hopkins Unfair Trade  10 76 There are certain words however in common use which are publici juris and which may not be appropriated as trademarks Such for example are geographical and proper names and descriptive words and no one can have an exclusive right to such names or words Canal Co v Clark 1871 13 Wall 311 Fischerv Blank 1893 138 N Y 244 Merriam v Texas Stflings Pub Co I892 49 Fed 944 Hopkins supra  32 49 The importance of distinguishing between the basis of the right in a trademark as above set forth and the basis of the right in unfair competition is brought out by a recent Massa chusetts case The plaintiff had since I885 used the word Key stone as a label for cigars which he manufactured and sold in New England where he had established a large market for his goods The defendant with the intention of diverting a part of the plaintiffs trade sold cigars in the same territory labeled Key stone Maid and the similarity of the labels was such that pur chasers were deceived into buying defendants cigars when they wanted cigars of the plaintiffs manufacture The word Keystone is a word in common use as a public label and is the name of ten towns in the United States and therefore the plaintiff could not assert a trademark right to it The court however enjoined the defendant from using the word on labels in the New England states Cohen v Nagle Mass 1906 76 N E 276 On principle it would seem that the right here recognized was not property in the word  Keystone because such a right would have entitled the plaintiff to an injunction without territorial limi tation Derringer v Plate supra The majority opinion endeavors to find some sort of property right in the word although admitting that it is not a trademark but the dissent by Loring J on this point represents the authorities Hopkins supra  76 Lord Langdales decision in Croft v Day 1843 7 Beav 84 that No man has a right to sell his own goods as the goods of another indicates in a negative way the basis of the right in the modern law of unfair competition Where a plaintiff has by using a particular name or label on his goods built up for them a reputation for ex cellence and the public have come to regard goods so marked as being manufactured by the plaintiff equity will restrain the fraudu lent use of the same name or label by another in such a way as to mislead the public as to the origin of the goods to the plaintiffs injury Singer Mfg Co v June Mfg Co I896 I63 U S I69 Calfornia FzgSyrup Co v Worden I899 95 Fed 132 Collins platt v Fznlayson 1898 88 Fed 693 The word or name has by association in the public mind with the plaintiffs goods acquired a secondary or trade meaning that is goods from the factory of the plaintiff and in such case the fact that the word is geographical or descriptive is immaterial if in fact its fraudulent use by the defend ant will result in the latter palming off his goods as the goods of the former Thompson v Montgomery 1889 41 Ch D 35 AmerNOTES 351 ican Waltham Watch Co v United States Watch Co 1889 173 Mass 85 Fischer v Blank I893 138 N Y 244 But the remedy should be extended no further than the right and since in the principal case the word Keystone as a cigar label had acquired a secondary or trade meaning only in the New England States the injunction was properly limited to that territory See also Lee v Haley I869 L R 5 Ch App I55 MEASURE OF DAMAGES IN TRESPASS WHERE THERE IS NO INJURY What damages may be recovered against a trespasser who comes upon anothers land and uses it for his own purposes for a period of time but without injury to the premises An action for use and occupation will not lie owing to the peculiar common law rule re quiring the relationof landlord and tenant as a prerequisite to such an action Preston v Hawley 1886 IoI N Y 586 even where all forms of actions have been abolished See Keener QuasiContracts I92 Ejectment will lie only if the trespasser be still in possession Trespass would seem the only available remedy but at the outset the plaintiff is confronted with the settled measure of damages which would restrict him to recompense for the actual loss sus tained by him 4 Sutherland Damages  i oI But in the case supposed no injury has been suffered Presumably then the plaintiff would recover but nominal damages 2 Waterman Tres pass  IO90 1092 and the trespasser would have the value of the use and enjoyment of the land for practically nothing In such a predicament the courts are apt to depart from ortho dox principles in order to do substantial justice A recently decided New York case illustrates this tendency A telephone company without leave strung wires over the plaintiffs roof and so main tained them during several months The plaintiff then brought trespass and although unable to prove any injury to his roof re covered a verdict on the basis of what the telephone company had paid others for license to use their roofs for similar purposes The Appellate Division sustaining the verdict held that the defendant should be required to respond in damages for the value of the use of the premises to him the trespasser Bunke v  Y Tel Co Jan I906 IIo App Div 241 There is some authority apparently favoring this unusual doc trine De Camp v Bullard 1899 I59 N Y 450 455 which is traceable to the influence of the socalled wayleave decisions Martin v Porter 1839 5 M  W 35I Phillips v Homfray 1871 L R 6 Ch App 770 Here the trespasser having carried coals through the plaintiffs mine the latter recovered what according to the custom of the neighborhood would have been paid for a way leave the underlying principle being that if one person has with out leave used anothers land for his own purposes he ought to pay for such user In reality the plaintiff is allowed the value of the use and occupation of his land in a trespass action But this is far from holding as does the principal case that the measure of

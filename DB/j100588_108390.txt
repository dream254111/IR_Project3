FLORENCE COPENHAGEN BERLIN GOTTINGEN MODENA STOCKHOLM MUNICH BRUXELLES VIENNA BOLOGNA 8FC FC RECEIVED NOVEMBER 19READ NOVEMBER 28 1850  33 ON ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMCONTINUED  II EXPERIMENTAL INQUIRY INTO THE LAWS OF ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETIC ACTION AND THEIR APPLICATION TO PARTICULAR CASES 2969 BELIEVING THAT EXPERIMENT MAY DO MUCH FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISM AND PRODUCE RAPIDLY A BODY OF FACTS ON WHICH PHILOSOPHERS MAY PROCEED HEREAFTER TO RAISE A SUPERSTRUCTURE I ENDEAVOURED TO FIND SOME MEANS OF REPRESENTING PRACTICALLY THE ACTION OF THE ATMOSPHERE WHEN HEATED BY THE SUN UPON THE TERRESTRIAL MAGNETIC CURVES THE OBJECT WAS TO OBTAIN SOME CENTRAL ARRANGEMENT OF FORCE WHICH SHOULD DEFLECT THESE CURVES OR LINES AS THEY ARE DEFLECTED IN A DIAMAGNETIC CONDUCTOR OR GLOBE OF HOT AIR 2877 AND THEN APPLY THE RESULTS OBTAINED BY SUCH AN ARRANGEMENT AS A PARTIAL TEST TO THE VARIOUS CASES SUPPLIED BY THE MAGNETIC OBSERVATORIES SCATTERED OVER THE EARTH AT FIRST I ENDEAVOURED FOR THE SAKE OF CONVENIENCE TO ATTAIN THIS DESIRED END BY MEANS OF A HORSESHOE MAGNET EMPLOYING THE LINES WHICH PASSED FROM POLE TO POLE TO DISTURB AND REARRANGE THE EARTHS FORCE BUT THE COMPARATIVE WEAKNESS OF THE TERRESTRIAL FORCE NEAR THE MAGNET AND THE GREAT PROMINENCE OF THE POLES OF THE LATTER GAVE RISE TO MANY INCONVENIENCES WHICH SOON CAUSED ME TO REJECT THAT METHOD AND HAVE RECOURSE TO A RINGHELIX AND VOLTAIC APPARATUS CONSIDERING THE NEW USE TO WHICH THIS HELIX IS TO BE APPLIED THE INTEREST OF THE RESULTS AND THE INSTRUCTION THAT MAY BE DRAWN FROMN THEM I SHALL BE EXCUSED FOR BEING SOMEWHAT ELEMENTARY IN THE DESCRIPTION OF ITS CHARACTER AND ACTION 2970 THE HELIX CONSISTED OF ABOUT 12 FEET OF COVERED COPPER WIRE FORMED INTO A RING HAVING ABOUT TWENTYFIVE CONVOLUTIONS AND BEING 12 INCH IN EXTERNAL DIAMETER THE CONTINUATIONS OF THE WIRE WERE TWISTED TOGETHER SO AS TO NEUTRALIZE ANY MAGNETIC EFFECT WHICH THEY COULD PRODUCE AND WERE LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TO A VOLTAIC ARRANGE MENT AND YET ALLOW FREE MOTION OF THE HELIX THE REQUISITE AMOUNT OF MAGNETIC POWER IN THE HELIX MAY BE JUDGED OF BY THE FOLLOWING CONSIDERATIONS SUPPOSE A DE CLINATION NEEDLE FREELY SUSPENDED AND THEN THE HELIX PLACED AT A DISTANCE IN THE PRO LONGATION OF THE NEEDLE WITH ITS AXIS IN A LINE WITH THE LATTER AND WITH THAT SIDE TO86 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII WARDS THE NEEDLE WHICH WILL AT SMALL DISTANCES CAUSE REPULSION THE NEEDLE WILL POINT IN THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FORCE BUT AS THE HELIX IS BROUGHT NEAR IT WILL POINT WITH LESS FORCE AND WITHIN A CERTAIN DISTANCE WILL NO LONGER POINT IN THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN BUT EITHER ON ONE OR THE OTHER SIDE OF IT THERE IS A GIVEN DISTANCE WITHIN WHICH THE NEEDLE WHEN IN THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS IN A POSITION OF UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM BUT BEYOND WHICLH IT HAS A POSITION OF STABLE EQUILIBRIUM THE DISTANCE VARYING WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE EXCITING ELECTRIC CURRENT THE POWER OF THE HELIX SHOULD BE SUCH THAT WHEN END ON TO THE NEEDLE THE LATTER HAS A POSITION OF STABLE EQUILIBRIUM IN THE MERIDIAN ONE PAIR OF PLATES IS QUITE SUFFICIENT TO MAKE THE HELIX AS MAGNETIC AS IS NEEDFUL FOR DISTANCES VARYING FROM 4 TO 24 INCHES WHEN A NEEDLE IS PROPERLY ARRANGED WITH EITHER A MAGNET OR A HELIX TO THE NORTH OR SOUTH OF IT AS ABOVE DESCRIBED IF THE MAGNET OR HELIX BE MOVED WEST THE NEAR END OF THE NEEDLE WILL MOVE EAST AND CONTRARIWISE 2971 AS IS WELL KNOWN SUCH A HELIX HAS A SYSTEMN OF MAGNETIC LINES WHICH PASSING THROUGH ITS AXIS THEN OPEN OUT AND TURNING ROUND ON THE OUTSIDE REENTERS AGAIN AT THE AXIS THE CIRCLES OF MAGNETIC FORCE BEING EVERYWHERE PERPENDICULAR TO THE ELECTRIC CURRENT TRAVERSING THE CONVOLUTIONS OF THE HELIX AND NOW I HAD AT A MOMENTS NO TICE A SOURCE OF LINES OF MAGNETIC POWER EXACTLY OF THE KIND REQUIRED TO PRODUCE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THOSE OF THE EARTH A DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES COINCIDING EITHER WITH THOSE OF PARAMAGNETIC OR DIAMAGNETIC POLARIZATION 2865 2877 2972 FOR LET FIG 17 REPRESENT A SECTION PARALLEL TO THE AXIS OF THE RINGHELIX FIG 17 THEN THE TWO CIRCLES MAY REPRESENT THE DISPOSITION OF THE MAGNETIC FORCE IN F THAT SECTION AND THE ARROWHEADS MAY SERVE TO INDICATE THAT MAGNETIC DIREC  TION WHICH BELONGS TO LINES OF FORCE ISSUING OUT OF THE NORTH END OF A MAGNET 7 IF SUCH A SYSTEM BE SUDDENLY PRODUCED IN THE MIDST OF THE EARTHS LINES IT ACTS UPON THEMN ACCORDING TO THE POSITION OF THE HELIX IN RELATION TO THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTHS POWER CHOOSING THE TWO POSITIONS IN WHICH THE AXIS OF THE HELIX IS PARALLEL TO THE NATURAL DIRECTION OF THE POWER AS SHOWN BY A FREE NEEDLE AT THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION THEN TWO CONTRARY EFFECTS ARE PRODUCED WHICH AS REGARDS THE LINES EXTERIOR TO THE HELIX SYSTEM CORRESPOND TO THE POLARITY OF PARAMAGNETIC AND DIAMAG NETIC CONDUCTORS IF FOR INSTANCE THE HELIX IS SO PLACED THAT THE POLARITY OF ITS MAG NETIC LINES EXTERIOR TO AND IN THE PLANE OF THE RING ACCORDS WITH THAT OF THE EARTHS FORCE AS IN FIG 18 THEN THE EARTHS LINES ARE DEFLECTED AS REPRE FIG 18 SENTED AND A MAGNETIC NEEDLE PLACED AT A WHICH HAD TAKEN UP ITS POSITION BY THE EARTHS INFLUENCE WILL NOT TEND TO ALTER ITS B POSITION AS THE HELIX APPROACHES IT THOUGH IT WILL BE ACTED ON WITH MORE POWER IN OTHER PARTS OF THE LINE B A C IT WILL ALTER ITS POSITION STANDING AS A TANGENT TO THE CURVATURE AND THERE FORE WILL BE DEFLECTED SOMETIMES ONE WAY AND SOMETIMES ANOTHER AS IT IS CARRIED ALONG THE LINE OR THROUGH THE NEIGHBOURING LINES IN PLACE OF REMAINING PARALLEL TO ITSELF AS IT WOULD DO IF THE ELECTROMAGNETIC HELIX WERE AWAY 2973 ON THE OTHER HAND IF THE HELIX WERE TURNED ROUND INTO THE SECOND POSITIONATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMDEFLECTION OF THE LINES OF FORCE 2972 THEN THLE EFFECT UPON THE DIRECTION OF THE NEIGHBOURING LINES OF FORCE WOULD BE AS IN FIG 19 NEEDLES PLACED AT D AND E WOULD AGAIN BE DEFLECTED FIG 19 FIROM THE NATURAL POSITION GIVEN TO THEM BY THE EARTH BUT THEY  F WOULD BE DEFLECTED IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION TO THAT WHICH WOULD 0 BE TAKEN IF THEY WERE IN CORRESPONDING SITUATIONS UNDER THE  FORMER ARRANGEMENT THIS FIGURE AND STATE OF THINGS REPRESENTS THE PARAMAGNETIC DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES AS THE FORMER DID THE DIAMAGNETIC CON DITION 2974 IT IS NOT PRETENDED THAT THE WHOLE OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS OF FORCES ARE LIKE THOSE OF THE CASES OF PARAMAGNETIC AND DIAMAGNETIC CONDUCTORS INDEPENDENT SYSTEMS ARE HERE INTRODUCED INTO THE MIDST OF THE EARTHS MAGNETIC POWER AND THE CENTRAL PART OF EACH ARRANGEMENT MUST THEREFORE BE EXCEPTED THERE ARE ALSO ATTRACTIONS INWARDS AND REPULSIONS OUTWARDS WHEN THE NEEDLE IS AT A ANDF WHICH DO NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE CASES OF MERE MAGNETIC CONDUCTION BUT EXTERNAL TO THESE HELIX SYSTEMS THE ARRANGE MENT IMPOSED UPON THE LINES OF FORCE FROM THE EARTH IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THAT PRO DUCED BY DIAMAGNETIC AND PARAMAGNETIC CONDUCTORS AND AT DISTANCES FIOM 2 INCHES TO 2 OR 3 FEET THE LINES OF FORCE THUS ALTERED AND THOSE CONTORTED BY THE SUN AND ATMO SPHERE IN THE GREAT FIELD OF NATURE ARE COMPARABLE IN THEIR DIRECTION AND MAY BE CON SIDERED AS REPRESENTING EACH OTHER 2975 IN ORDER TO OBTAIN A SIMPLE RESULT OF THE ACTION OF SUCH A CENTRE OF FORCE ON THE MAGNETIC LINES OF THE EARTH I ADJUSTED A ROD IN THE DIRECTION OF THE DIPPINGNEEDLE AND ALSO A PLANE AT THE FOOT OF IT PARALLEL TO THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR AT LONDON THEN SUSPENDING A SMALL MAGNET HALF AN INCH LONG FROM COCOONSILK SO THAT WHEN HANGING IT SHOULD BE PARALLEL TO THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR IT WAS ADJUSTED SO AS TO BE NEAR TO THE PLANE AT THE FOOT OF THE ROD REPRESENTING DIP THE RINGHELIX 2970 WAS THEN ASSO CIATED WITH THE VOLTAIC PAIR SO THAT CONTACT COULD BE COMPLETED AT ANY MOMENT AND BEING ALWAYS RETAINED PARALLEL TO ITSELF AND TO THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR COULD BE BROUGHT INTO THE VICINITY OF THE NEEDLE ON ALL SIDES ABOVE OR BELOW AND ITS ACTION UPON IT OBSERVED AS THE OBJECT WAS TO REPRESENT THE SUNS ACTION THE CURRENT WAS SO SENT THROUGH THE HELIX THAT ITS UPPER FACE WOULD REPEL THE NORTH END OF A MAG NETIC NEEDLE FOR THEN A MAGNET OUTSIDE OF AND IN THE PLANE OF THE RING WOULD NOT TEND TO HAVE ITS POSITION CHANGED AND THE DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES OF THE EARTH UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE HELIX WAS AS IN FIG 18 OR LIKE THAT OF A DIAMAGNETIC CONDUCTOR 2976 IN MAKING OBSERVATIONS OF THIS KIND AND ESPECIALLY IF THE RINGHELIX IS PUR POSELY RETAINED AT A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE FROM THE NEEDLE IT IS BETTER NOT TO CONNECT THE HELIX PERMANENTLY WITH THE BATTERY AND THEN CARRY IT TOWARDS AND BY THE NEEDLE BUT RATLHER TO CHOOSE THE PLACE WHERE THE HELIX ACTION IS TO BE OBSERVED AND WHEN THE HELIX IS THERE TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE BATTERY THE MOTION AND DIRECTION OF THE NEEDLE IS THEN EASILY OBSERVED OR IF IT STILL THROUGH REASON OF DISTANCE BE FEEBLE MAKING AND BREAKING CONTACT A FEW TIMES ISOCHRONOUSLY WITH THE VIBRATIONS OF THE NEEDLE SOON RAISES THE EFFECT TO ANY DEGREE REQUIRED 8788 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII 2977 THERE ARE CERTAIN POSITIONS IN RESPECT OF THE NEEDLE AS A CENTRE WHICH MUST BE CLEARLY COMPREHENDED THE MAGNETIC AXIS IS A LINE THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE FREE REGULAR NEEDLE PARALLEL TO THE DIRECTION OF THE EARTHS LINES OF FORCE WHATEVER THAT MNAY BE AT THE PLACE WHERE THE EXPERIMENTS MAY BE MADE THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR PLANE IS A PLANE PASSING THROUGH THE CENTRE OF THE NEEDLE PERPENDICULAR TO THE MAG NETIC AXIS THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS THAT PLANE WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE MAGNETIC AXIS AND ALSO WITH THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE DECLINATION NEEDLE POINTS THIS POSITION ALWAYS OCCURS WITH THE MAGNETS THAT ARE EMPLOYED FOR OBSERVATION BEING A CONSEQUENCE OF THE METHOD IN WHICH THEY ARE SUPPORTED IT WOULD NOT BE TAKEN BY A NEEDLE PLACED AT RIGHT ANGLES ON ITS MECHANICAL AXIS THE LATTER BEING IN THE IAG NETIC AXIS 2978 WHEN THE RINGHELIX SITUATED AS BEFORE EXPLAINED 2975 WAS ANYWHERE IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IT EXERTED NO ACTION ON THE DECLINATION NEEDLE TENDING TO CHANGE ITS POSITION WHEN THE HELIX WAS ANYWHERE IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR IT EXERTED NO ACTION ON THE NEEDLE TO MAKE IT CHANGE ITS DIRECTION THESE ARE THE ONLY PLACES IN WHICH THE HELIX DOES NOT AFFECT THE POSITION OF THE NEEDLE 2979 THESE TWO PLANES OF NO VARIATION DIVIDE THE SPACE AROUND THE MAGNET INTO FOUR QUADRANTS AND THE HELIX BEING IN ANY ONE OF THESE AFFECTS THE NEEDLE ALTERING ITS DECLINATION THE DEFLECTION OF THE LINE OF FORCE FOR TWO NEIGHBOURING QUADRANTS IS IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION SO THAT AS THE HELIX PASSES FROM THE NEUTRAL LINE INTO ONE OR THE OTHER QUADRANT THE DECLINATION OF THE NEEDLE CHANGES 2980 IF THE HELIX BE ABOVE OR BELOW THE MNAGNETIC EQUATOR AND BE CARRIED ROUND THE MAGNETIC AXIS TRAVELLING ALONG A LINE OF LATITUDE THEN THE NEEDLE MAKES ONE LARGE OSCILLATION TO THE RIGHT AND ANOTHER TO THE LEFT DURING THE CIRCUIT SUPPOSING THAT THE EXPERIMENT COMMENCES WITH THE HELIX ABOVE THE EQUATOR AND IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN NORTH OF THE NEEDLE IF IT THEN PROCEEDS BY WEST TO SOUTH AND ON BY EAST TO ITS ORIGINAL POSITION THE NORTH END OF THE NEEDLE WILL FIRST GO WESTWARD WILL THEN STOP AND RETURN EASTWARD PASSING THE MEAN POSITION AND WILL FINALLY RETURN WESTWARD AND SETTLE IN ITS FIRST OR ORIGINAL DIRECTION ALL THE TIME THE HELIX IS TO MAGNETIC EAST OF THE NEEDLE IT WILL CAUSE THE SAME DEFLECTION AND ALSO AS LONG AS IT IS IN THE WEST THE DEFLECTION WILL BE MORE OR LESS BUT NOT CHANGE IN DIRECTION AS REGARDS THE NEUTRAL PLACE THE POSITION OF THE HELIX NORTH OR SOUTH OF THE NEEDLE IS OF NO CONSEQUENCE AS TO THE DIRECTION OF THE DECLINATION PROVIDED IT REMAIN ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THOUGH IT IS TO THE AMOUNT IF THE HELIX BE BELOW THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR THE DIRECTION OF THE DECLINATION IS REVERSED BUT THEN AGAIN IT DOES NOT CHANGE WHILST THE HELIX REMAINS EAST OR WEST OF THE NEEDLE AND ITS PLANE OF MEAN DECLINATION 2981 IF WE CARRY THE HELIX ROUND THE NEEDLE IN A PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THE PLANES OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR AND MERIDIAN SO AS TO TRAVERSE IN SUCCESSION THE FOUR QUA DRANTS THEN THE NEEDLE MAKES TWO TO AND FRO VIBRATIONS INSTEAD OF ONE DURING THEATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMEXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATIONS CIRCUIT THUS BEGINNING WITH THE HELIX IN THE NEUTRAL POSITION OVER THE NEEDLE AND GOING ROUND BY WEST AND BELOW AND THEN UPWARDS ON THE EAST SIDE TO ITS FIRST POSITION THE NORTH END OF THE NEEDLE WILL FIRST PASS WESTWARD THEN EASTWARD THEN WESTWARD AFTER THAT EASTWARD AND FINALLY WESTWARD TO ITS ORIGINAL OR NEUTRAL POSITION 2982 AS THE HELIX IS CARRIED FROM THE NEUTRAL PLANES 2978 INTO ANY OF THE QUA DRANTS THE POWER OF AFFECTING THE DECLINATION OF THE NEEDLE IS FIRST DEVELOPED AND THEN INCREASES EVERY WAY FROM THE EDGES OF THE QUADRANT UNTIL IT ATTAINS ITS MAXIMUM FORCE AT THE MIDDLE HENCE THE MAXIMUM DEFLECTION EAST OR WEST IS WHEN THE HELIX IS IN THE MIDDLE OF EACH QUADRANT THEREFORE WHEN THE HELIX IS CARRIED FROM THE NIIDDLE OF 6NE QUADRANT TO THE MIDDLE OF THE NEXT ONLY ONE MOTION IN THE NEEDLE APPEARS AS FOR INSTANCE AN INCREASING WESTERLY DECLINATION THOUGH THE DIRECTION OF THE DECLINATION IN RELATION TO THE MEAN POSITION HAS BEEN REVERSED IN THAT TIME AND THERE WAS A MOMENT WHEN THE NEEDLE HAD NO EXTRA DECLINATION BUT WAS IN THAT MEAN POSITION SO ALSO AS THE HELIX MOVES OVER ONE QUADRANT FIOM ONE NEUTRAL PLANE TO ANOTHER THOUGH THE DECLINATION OF THE NEEDLE PRODUCED BY IT HAS NOT CHANGED IN DIRECTION BUT HAS BEEN FOR INSTANCE ALL THE TIME WEST STILL THE NEEDLE WILL HAVE EX HIBITED TWO MOTIONS GOING FIRST WEST DURING THE INCREASE OF THE POWER AND THEN EAST WHILST IT IS DIMINISHING AND HENCE IT IS THAT THOUGH THERE ARE FOUR DEPARTTRES OF THE NEEDLE FROM AND RETURN TO THE NEUTRAL OR MEAN POSITION WVHILST THE HELIX CIRCNM SCRIBES IT IN AN EAST ANDL WEST VELTICAL PLANE 2981 THERE ARE ONLY TWO COMPLETE JOURNEYS OF THE NEEDLE 2983 THE AMOUNT OF THE DEFLECTION DIMINISHES AS THE DISTANCE OF THE HELIX FROM THE NEEDLE INCREASES AND THE CONTRARY 2984 TWO OTHER NEEDLES WERE SLUNG 2975 VERY OBLIQUE TO THE MAGNETIC AXIS ONE WITH ITS NORTH END UPWARDS AND THE OTHER WITH ITS NORTH END DOWNWARDS AND THESE WERE SUBMITTED TO THE ACTION OF THE HELIX AS THE FORMER HAD BEEN 2978 THEY WERE AFFECTED EXACTLY IN THE SAME MANNER SHOWING NO DIFFELIENCE I E A GIVEN END ALWAYS INOVED THE SAME WAY FOR THE SAME CHANGE IN POSITION OF THE HELIX IF THE HELIX WAS VERY NEAR THEN ONE POLE WAS A LITTLE MORE INFLUENCED THAN THE OTHER IN CERTAIN POSITIONS BUT ITS RENMOVAL FURTHER OFF TOOK AWAY THAT DIFFERENCE WHICHL IS EASILY ACCOUNTED FOR 2970 AND PRODUCED PURE RESULTS THE PLACE OF THE HELIX ABOVE OR BELOW THE PROLONGATION OF THE LINE OF THE NEEDLE MADE NO DIFFERENCE PRO VIDED IT WAS IN THE SAME PLACE AS REGARDED THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR OF THE EARTHS LINES OF FORCE PASSING THROUGH THE NEEDLE 2985 FOR THE PURPOSE OF ESTABLISHING THE NATURE OF THE ACTION WLHICH SUCH A HELIX ALWAYS IN THE GIVEN OR DIAMAGNETIC POSITION 2975 WOULD EXERT UPON THE INCLINATION A SMALL DIPPINGNEEDLE WAS SUBMITTED TO ITS ACTION AND THE FOLLOWING RESULTS OBTAINED THE NEEDLE COULD MOVE IN THE PLANE PASSING THROUGH THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN OF LONDON 2986 THERE WAS NO DEFLECTION OF THE NEEDLE WHEN THE HELIX WAS IN THE PLANE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR OR IN A PLANE PERPENDICULAR TO THAT CONTAINING THE MECHANICAL AXIS MDCCCLI N 8990 DR FARAIAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII OF THE NEEDLE IN EVERY OTHER POSITION IT AFFECTED IT SO THAT THESE TWO PLANES DIVIDED THE SPHERE OF ACTION INTO FOUR SEGMENTS AS BEFORE 2987 AS THE HELIX PASSES FROM ONE QUADRANT TO ANOTHER THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE NEEDLE IS DEFLECTED CHANGES AS BEFORE 2982 IF THE HELIX IS IN THE UPPER NORTH SEG MENT OR THE LOWER SOUTH SEGMENTTHE UPPER OR SOTUTH END OF THE NEEDLE IS DEFLECTED TOWARDS THE SOUTH IF THE HELIX BE IN THE UPPER SOUTH OR LOWER NORTH SEGMENTS THE UPPER OR SOUTH END OF THE NEEDLE IS DEFLECTED TOWARDS THE NORTH IF THE HELIX BE CARRIED ROUND THE NEEDLE IN THE DIECTION OF THE PLANE OF MOTION WHICH IN THIS CASE IS THAT OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THE NETIEND OFE THE TNEEDLE STARTING FROM A MEAN OR UN AFFECTED POSITION WILL MOVE FIRST ONE WAY AS FOR INSTANCE NORTH AND THEN SOUTH NORTH AGAIN AND SOUTH AGAIN AND FINALLY NORTH TO REGAIN ITS PLACE OF REST SO THAT THERE AR E TWO EXTREE DEFLECTIONS OF THE END IN EACH DIRECTIOWN AS BEFORE IN THE CASE OF THE DECLINATION MAGNET 2982 2988 IN OTHER WODS WHEN THE HELIX WAS ANYWHERSE BELOW THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR THE LOWER OR NORTH END OF THE NEEDLE TENDED TO POINT OUTWARDS FROM IT OR OUTSIDE OF IT BEING AS IT WERE REPELLED BY THE AXIS OF THE HELIX BUT DRAWN BY THE OUTER CURVED LINES OF FORCE FIG 20 2992 OR IF THE HELIX WERE ABOVE THE EQUATOR THEN THE UPPER OR SOUTH END OF THE NEEDLE WENT OUTWARDS FROMI THE HELIX MOVING EXACTLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION IN RELATION TO THE HELIX AS THE LOWER POLE DID BEFORE 2989 HE SUPPORT OF THE NEEDLE WAS TURNED ROUND 90 WHICH THEREFORE REMOVED THE PLANE IN WHICT THE NEEDLE COULD MOVE 90 FTROM THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THIS CARRIED THE PLANE OF NO ACTION ON THE NEEDLEE 90 ROUND SO THAT IT NOW COINCIDED WITH THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND THE PLANE WHICH STANDIG EAST AND WEST WAS BEFORE NEUTRAL WAS NO LONGER A PLANE OF INDIFFERENCE BUT IN FACT PASSED AT THE MIDDLE OF THE SEGMENTS THROUGH THE PLACES OF STRONGEST ACTION 2990 HERE WITH INCLINATION AS BEFORE WITH DECLINATION IT IS NOT THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE NEEDLE STANDS THAT DETERMINES WHAT ACTION THE HELIX MNAY HLAVE UPON IT FOR IT MAY BE LOADED OR OTHERWISE RESTRAINED AS ALL HORIZONTAL NEEDLES ARE BUT IT IS THE DIRECTION OF THE LINES OF FORCE AT THE NEEDLE WHICH WITH THE HELIX GOVERNS ALL THE HELIX MAY BE ABOVE OR BELOW THE PROLONGATION OF THE NEEDLE INDIFFERENTLY FOR IF IT STILL CONTINUES ON THE SAME SIDE OF THE LINE OF FORCE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF WHICH THE NEEDLE ACTS THEN THE END OF THE NEEDLE MOVES IN THE SAME DIRECTION THOUGH IT MNAY TRAVEL TOWARDS THE HELIX IN ONE INSTANCE AND FROMRN IT IN ANOTHER 2991 I SUSPENDED A NEEDLE SO THAT IT WAS FREE TO MOVE IN EVERY DIRECTION AND NOW I OBTAINED THE SIMPLE NATURAL EFFECT OF THE HELIX OR A DIAMAGNETIC GLOBE 2877 ON A GIVEN LINE OF FORCE AND IT IS WELL TO HAVE IT IN MIND FOR THOUGHL WE ARE OBLIGED FOR THE SAKE OF PRACTICAL OBSERVATION TO DIVIDE TIHE POSITION INTO TWO PARTS DECLINATION AND INCLINATION YET THE RESULTS IN EACH CASE ARE MUCH BETTER COMPARED AND REMEMTIBERED WHEN THE SIMPLE LAW OF CHANGE IN THLE WHOLE LINE OF FORCE IS READY IN THE MIND FOR REFERENCE THE EQUATORIAL PLANE AND THE MAGNETIC AXIS ARE NOW THE ONLY PARTS IN WLIICH THE HELIX CAN BE WITHOUT AFFECTING THE POSITION OF THE NEEDLEATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMEXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATIONS THE FIRST GIVES PLACES FOR THE 1HELIX WITH A STABLE POSITION FOR THE NEEDLE AND THE SECOND SUCH AS HAVE EITHER STABLE OR UNSTABLE POSITIONS ACCORDING TO THE HELIX DISTANCE 2992 IF THE HELIX BE OUT OF THE PLANE AND AXIS THEN THE END OF THE NEEDLE NEAREST TO IT LEANS FROM IT AS IF REPELLED IF THE HELIX BE CARRIED ROUND IN A CIRCLE OF LATITUDE THE END OF THE NEEDLE MOVES ROUND BEFORE IT JUST LIKE THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLES AT HOBARTON AND TORONTO IN RESPECT OF THE SUN DURING THE MIDDAY HOURS INSTEAD OF MOVING THE HELIX ROUND THE NEEDLE WE MAY CARRY THE NEEDLE INTO DIFFERENT POSITIONS AS REGARDS THE HELIX AND THEN FIG 20 WILL REPRESENT THE RESULT A FIG 20 RESULT EXCEEDINGLY SIMPLE AND IN PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH THE DIA MAGNETIC DISPOSITION OF THE FORCES PRODUCED BY THE HELIX 2972 AS THE TWO DOTTED LINES INDICATE S 2993 AS AN EXPRESSION OF THE FACTS FOR USE IN APPLYING THEM TO THE EXPLANATION AND ILLUSTRATION OF NATURAL PHENOMENA IT MAY BE SAID IN RESPECT OF DECLINATION THAT THE HELIX BEING ABOVE THE NEEDLE S IN A PLANE HAVING DIP AND THEREFORE ABOVE ITS MAGNETIC ELUATOR IF ON THE EAST OF A NEEDLE HAVING NORTH DIP IT WILL SEND THE SOUTH OR UPPER END WEST OR IF ON THE EAST OF A NEEDLE HAVING SOUTH DIP BEING OF COURSE THEN ITSELF INVERTED 2972 IT WILL CAUSE THE NORTH OR UPPER END TO PASS WESTWARD  SEEMING TO REPEL THE END OF THE FIREE NEEDLE OR PALTT OF THE LINE OF FORCE NEAREST TO IT IN REFERENCE TO THE INCLINATION IT MAY BE SAID THAT THE HELIX BEING ABOVE THE NEEDLE TENDS TO SEND THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE OR LINE OF FORCE FROM IT IF THE HELIX IS NORTH OF THE MNAGNETIC AXIS IT WILL TEND TO SEND THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE SOUTH IF IT IS SOUTH THE UPPER END WILL GO NORTH AS IN THE CASE OF THE DECLI NATION IT IS AS IF THE END OF THE FREE NEEDLE OR LINE OF FORCE NEAREST TO IT WAS REPELLED IN FACT EVERY CASE IS INCLUDED IN THIS RESULT THAT IF THE HELIX BE DIAMAGNETICALLY ADJUSTED 2975 FOR A FIEE NEEDLE WHETHER IT IS ABOVE OR BELOW THE NEEDLE OR ON THIS SIDE OR THAT THE NEAREST END OF THE NEEDLE WILL BE AS IF REPELLED PROVIDED THE HELIX IS NOT IN A NEUTRAL POSITION 2994 I REPEATED ALL THESE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE HELIX REVERSED SO AS TO GIVE THE EFFECT OF A PARAMAGNETIC GLOBE OF AIR 2865 2973 I NEED ONLY SAY THAT THE EFFECTS WERE PRECISELY THE SAME IN NATURE AND ORDER ONLY IN THE REVERSE DIRECTION THEY WILL BE REQUIRED IN THE EXPLICATION OF THE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING ACTIONS DUE TO THE COOLING OF THE ATMOSPHERE 3003 3010 2995 IN THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE LAWS OF DEFLECTION MIGHT APPEAR IN THEIR SIMPLICITY THE NEEDLE WAS SUSPENDED IN THE AIR AND THE REPRESENTATION OF THE SUNS ACTION CARRIED ROUND IT IN ALL DIRECTIONS BUT IN NATURE THE AIR IS ONLY ABOVE THE NEEDLE AND THE EARTH AS A MAGNET IS BENEATH IT IN THE NATURAL CASE ALSO THERE IS THE FIXATION OF THE LINES IN THE EARTH 2919 WHICH TENDS BY HOLDING THEM BELOW THE SURFACE TO GIVE THEM AN AMOUNT OF DEFLECTION AT THE SURFACE FAR BEYOND WHAT THEY WOULD HAVE IF THEY WERE AS FREE TO MOVE IN THE EARTH BENEATH AS IN THE SPACE N 2 9L92 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII ABOVE AND THOUGH THIS DEFLECTION WOULD COINCIDE WITH THAT PRODUCED BY THE HELIX ALONE STILL IT WAS IMPORTANT TO VERIFY ITS EFFECT I THEREFORE TOOK A BAR MAGNET 30 INCHES LONG AND WEAK IN CONDITION AND SUSPENDED THE NEEDLE ABOVE IT IN VARIOUS PARTS SO AS TO HAVE THE EFFECT OF NORTH OR SOUTH DIP TO ANY DEGREE SOR NO DIP AT ALL NEAR THE MIDDLE PARTS THE EFFECT OF ABSENCE OF AIR FROM BENEATH WAS ALSO IN A CERTAIN DEGREE REPRESENTED AND TO MAKE THIS POINT MORE STRIKING I OCCASIONALLY PUT MASSES OF IRON ON AND UNDER THE MIDDLE PART OF THE MAGNET THE RESULTS WITH THE HELIX WERE NOW INFLUENCED GREATLY IN THE AMOUNT OF THE DEFLECTION BUT NOT IN THE DIRECTION WHEN THE HELIX AFFECTED THE DIRECTION OF THE NEEDLE IT WAS ACCORDING TO THE ABOVE LAWS 2996 IN THE CONSIDERATION OF NATURAL PHENOMENA THE MAGNETIC AXIS AND ALSO THE PLANES OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR ANTD MERIDIAN BEING CIRCLES OR PLANES OF NO DEFLECTION ARE VERY IMPORTANT CHANGING AS THEY DO WITH EVERY CHANGE EITHER OF PLACE OR DE CLINATION OR DIP THEY REQUIRE SOME READY MEANS OF ILLUSTRATION AND CAN HARDLY BE COMPREHENDED IN THEIR EFFECTS WITHOUT A MODEL I HAVE PREPARED A GLOBE ON WHICH AFTER MARKING THE PLACES OF THE OBSERVATORIES I HAVE DRAWN THE MAGNETIC MERIDIANS OF THESE PLACES AS THEY WERE LAST ESTIMATED I HAVE THEN IN ANOTHER COLOUR DRAWN FOR EACH PLACE ITS MAGNETIC EQUATOR MAKING THAT A GREAT CIRCLE PARALLEL TO THE EQUATORIAL PLANE OF THE DIPPINGNEEDLE AT THE PLACE I HAVE ALSO MARKED ON THE GLOBE THE MEAN PATH OF THE SUN FOR EACH MONTH AND BY THE USE OF ADJUSTIBLE PINS TO INDICATE THE HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER NOON OF ANY GIVEN PLACE I HAVE THE MEANS OF ASCERTAINING WITH SUFFICIENT ACCURACV WHEN THE SUN IS IN ANY PARTICULAR QUADRANT OR WHAT PART OF THE QUADRANT WHEN IT PASSES A NEUTRAL LINE AND WHAT ITS POSITION IN RELATION TO THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION IS IN A MANNER WHICH NO DIAGRAMS OR FIGURES COULD SUPPLY I HAVE FOUND THE GLOBE VERY USEFIL AND I ACCUSTOM MYSELF TO PLACE IT ALWAYS IN A CER TAIN POSITION NAMELY WITH THE AXIS OF ROTATION HORIZONTAL THE NORTH POLE TO MY RIGHT HAND AND TTE ASTRONOMNICAL MERIDIAN OF THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION TOWARDS THE ZENITH THE OBSERVER CAN THEN REGARD IT AS FROM THE PLACE OF THE RISING SUN 2997 RRHOUGH WE THUS HAVE THE EXPERIMENTAL CONDITIONS OF A NEEDLE UNDER AN ACTION LIKE THAT RESULTING IN NATURE FROM THE PRESENCE OF THE SUN 2920 1 DO NOT PRETEND THAT THEY CAN BE APPLIED WITHOUT MODIFICATION TO NATURAL PENOLENA BUT ONLY THAT TYIEY GIVE VERY IMPORTANT AID IN THE STUDY OF THE LATTER AND THE RATIONALE OF THEI O ATMOSPHERE INSTEAD OF BEING ILLIMITABLE WRAPS THE EARTH ROUND AS A GARMIENT THE INFLUENCE AS IT EXTENDS FROM THE REGION OF ACTION MRUST IN RESPECT OF THAT PORTION WHICH IS CONVEYED THROUGH ITS MASS 2920 CURVE WITH ITS CURVATURE AND GIVE A RESUTLT IN ANY PARTICULAR PLACE WHICH ONLY REFINED CALCULATIONS FOUNDED UPON CAREFUL OBSERVATIONS CAN DETERMRINE ACCTURATELY IN REGARD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIR ACTION IT WOULD I THINK BE VERY INTERESTING TO ASCERTAIN EVEN ROUGHLY THE  REFERRING TO THE TYPICAL GLOBE OF COLD AIR 2874 IT IS MANIFEST THAT IF THE SPACE BELOW THE HORIZONTAL LINES A C C WERE OCCUPIED BY MATTER HOLDING THE LINES IN IT THEN THE DEFLECTIONS NOW REPRESENTED ON THE LOWER PARTS WOULD APPEAR ABOVE THE HOLDIRNG SURFACES AND TO A MUCH GREATER DEGREE THOUGH EXTENDING DOWNWARDS TO A MUCH SMALLER SPACEATMOSPH ERIC MAGNETISMEXPERIMENTAL ILLUSTRATIONS DAILY VARIATIONS OF A MNAGNET AT THE BOTTOM OF A DEEP MINE HALFWAY UP AND AT THE MOUTH OF THE SHAFT THE RESULTS MIGHT TELL US MUCH ABOUT THE HOLDING POWER OF THE EARTH AND THE DEPTHS TO WHICH THE DEFLECTIONS OF THE MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE PENE TRATE AND MIGHT EVEN GIVE US A ROUGH EXPRESSION OF THE CHANGES OF THE INTERNAL POWER OR THE ABSENCE OF SUCH CHANGES WHEN FREED FROM THOSE DEPENDENT UPON THE ATMOSPHERE 2998 ANOTHER REASON WHY THE EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS MUST NOT BE APPLIED TOO CLOSELY IS AS FOLLOWS IF THE LINES OF FORCE OF THE EARTH WERE PERFECTLY REGULAR THEN THE CHANGE PRODUCED AMONGST THEM BY THE SUN AND AIR WOULD BE REGULAR ALSO BUT AS THE NATURAL SYSTEM IS NOT REGULAR EITHER BETWEEN THE TROPICS AS AT SISTERS WALK AND LONGFORD IN ST HELENA OR IN THE HIGHER LATITUDES AS AT HUDSONS BAY SO APPARENT INCONSISTENCES MAY AND MUST RESULT THE PROBABILITY IS THAT THE GREATEST IRREGULARITIES IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE EARTHS MAGNETISM ARE IN AND NEAR THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH AND THAT ABOVE THEY TEND TO ADJUST WITHL EACH OTHER INTO A MORE REGULAR ORDER STILL THE IRREGULARITIES MUST EXTEND THEIR INFLUENCE VERY FAR UPWARDS SO THAT THE CONTORTIONS OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIANS OR LINES OF FORCE ARE NOT LIKELY TO BE EFFACED OR MUCH DIMI NISHED AT THE REGION COINCIDING WITH THE PLACE OF THE ATMOSPHERES EFFECT 2999 BUT THOUGH THE LINES ARE IRREGULAR IN THE LAIRGE SPACE AFFECTED BY THE SUN THE RESULT WILL BE EXPANSION OF THE WHOLE AS A SYSTEM AND DIAMAGNETIC POLARITY THE LINES OF FORCE BELOW WILL BE AFFECTED BY THOSE ABOVE AND SO THOUGH A PERFECT SIMILARITY BETWEEN DIFFERENT PLACES IS NOT TO BE EXPECTED STILL THE KIND OF CHANGE AT THE EARTHS SURFACE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE SO UNCERTAIN AS IT MIGHT AT FIRST APPEAR THEREFORE I BELIEVE THE GLOBE 2996 WILL BE FOUND VERY USEFUL IN GIVING INFORMATION REGARDING THE PROBABLE EFFECTS AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND EQUATOR DUE TO THE PLACE OF THE SUTN IN THE TWO CHIEF QUADRANTS FOR ANY GIVEN MONTH OF THE YEAR OR HOUR OF THE DAY 3000 THE PASSAGE OF THE MAGNETIC RNERIDIAN IS IMPORTANT AND APPEARS FAR MORE SO AFTER THE EXPERIMENT DESCRIBED 2978 THAN IT DID ON A FORMNER OCCASION 2942 BEING VERY OFTEN INCLINED TO THE ASTRONOMICAL MRERIDIAN IT MUST HAVE GREAT INFLUENCE IN DE CIDING WHEN THE DAILY DECLINATION CHANGES IN ITS DIRECTION THE PLACE OF GREATEST ACTION AND ITS TRAVELLING NORTHL OR SOUTH ALONG A LINE OF MNAGNETIC FORCE ACCORDING AS THE DECLI NATION WAS WEST OR EAST IN RELATION TO THE HELIX AS A SUN WAS CONFIRMED BY AN EXPERI MENT AND THE FURTHER OBSERVATION A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FORMER THAT WHEN THE SUN WAS EQUIDISTANT FIROM A PLACE MORE NORTH OR SOUTH THAN ITSELF ITS ACTION WAS FAR STRONGER ON THAT SIDE AT WHICH ITS PATH AND THE DECLINATION DIRECTION MADE AN ACUTE ANGLE THAN ON THE OTHER SIDE WHERE IT WAS OBTUSE WAS ALSO CONFIRMED THUS IF THE HELIX MOVING FROM EAST TO WEST WERE PASSING A PLACE NORTH OF IT HAVING WESTERN DECLINATION THLEN THE ACTION WAS STRONGER ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE PLACE THAN ON THE EAST FOR EQUAL DISTANCES OF THE HELIX FROM THE MAGNET 3001 THE PASSAGE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR BY THE SUN IS ALSO IMPORTANT SINCE THE DIRECTION OF THE DIURNAL VATIATION OF THE EXPERIMENTAL NEEDLE IS THEN ALTERED AND THIS IS OF THE NIORE CONSEQUENCE BECAUSE BY THE GREAT DEGREE OF NATURAL DECLINATION IN MANY 9394 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII PLACES EVEN FAR NORTH AND SOUTH THIS PASSAGE IS THROWN FORWARD TOWARDS THE ASTRONO MICAL MERIDIAN EITHER ON THE EAST SIDE OR THE WEST AND COMES INTO EFFECT DURING THE MORE INFLUENTIAL HOURS OF THE SUN OR THE COLD IN ALL THOSE PLACES TOO WHERE THE DIP IS LITTLE AS AT ST HELENA AND IN OR NEAR THE SUNS PATH IT MAY BE IMPORTANT IN IN FLUENCING THE AMOUNT OF ACTION FROM THE CHANGE OF PLACE OF THE SUN BETWEEN TILE TROPICS AND THE VARIETY OF DIP AND DECLINATION AT DIFFERENT PLACES THE PASSING OF THE NEUTRAL PLANES BY THE SUN AND ACTING REGION TMUST TAKE PLACE UNDER AN EXTREME VARIETY OF CONDITIONS  THE UNRAVELLING OF WHICH I THINK WILL BE MUCH ASSISTED BY KNOWLEDGE SUCH AS THAT WHICH THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS AND PRINCIPLES GIVE THE SUN MAY BE ASTRONOMICALLY EITHER NORTTH OR SOUTH OF THE NEEDLE AND YET THE DECLINATION OF THE NEEDLE NOT CHANGE IN DIRECTION 2980 OR IF THERE WERE MUCH MEAN DECLINATION AS AT GREENWICH THEN IT MIGHT BE ASTRONOMICALLY EAST OR WEST OF IT AND YET THE DECLINATION PRODUCED NOT CHANGE ITS DIRECTION THE SUN REGION MAY BE SOUTH OF A PLACE AND YET SEND ITS UPPER END FURTHER SOUTH 2990 FOR ALL WILL DEPEND UPON ITS POSITION IN RELA TION TO THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND THE MAGNETIC AXIS WHICH ARE IN MOST CASES VERY FAR REMOVED FROM THOSE THAT ARE ASTRONOMICAL ADDED TO ALL THESE CAUSES OF VARIETY THERE IS THE FIXATION OF THE LINES OF FORCE IN THE EARTH 2919 WHICH TENDS TO GIVE A FURTHER DIVERSITY TO THEM 3002 IN THE FORMER PAPER I CONSIDERED ONLY THE EFFECT OF AIR RAISED IN TEMPERATURE ABOVE THE MEAN CONDITION 2895 ILLUSTRATING IT BY THE SUNS EFFECT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY NOW I PURPOSE CONSIDERING THAT WHICH WILL BE PRODUCED BY THE COLD OF NIGHT WHICH REDUCES THE AIR OF A GIVEN REGION BELOW THLE NMEAN AIR TEMPERATURE OF THAT PLACE WHEN A PORTION OF AIR IS SO COOLED ITS CONDUCTION POWER IS INCREASED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE WARMER AIR OF SURROUNDING REGIONS IT DEFLECTS THE LINES OF MAGNETIC FORCE PASSING THROUGH BOTH AS INDICATED BY THE TYPE GLOBE 2864 2874 AND ACQUIRES WHAT I HAVE CALLED CONDUCTION POLARITY PATARAMAGNETIC MEANING THEREBY SIMPLY THLAT THE LINES OF FORCE DRAW TOGETHER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE COOLED AIR 3003 THEORETICALLY THE EFFECT OF A COLD REGION OF AIR COMING UP FROM THE EAST WOULD BE TO MAKE THE MAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE AS THEY LEAVE THE EARTH ADVANCE OR BEND TO WARDS IT BECAUSE THOSE IN AND ABOUT THE COLD AIR ARE INFLECTED INTO IT AND AS THOSE IMNMEDIATELY WEST OF THE COLD REGION MOVE INTO OR TOWARDS IT SO THOSE FURTHER WEST BEING IN PART RELIEVED FROMR THEIR TENSION WILL ALSO MOVE EAST AND THUS AN EFFECT THE REVERSE OF THAT OF THE SUN 2877 2972 OR THE SAME AS THAT OF THE HELIX IN THE PARA MAGNETIC POSITION 2973 2994 WILL BE PRODUCED THE UPPER ENDS OF NEEDLES AT PLACES HAVING DIP SHOW THIS DEFLECTION OF THE UPPER PART OF THE LINES OF FORCE BECAUSE THEY MOVE BY WITH AND IN THEM 3004 SO AS COLD APPROACHES THE LINES WILL LEAN TOWARDS IT UNTIL IT IS IN THE POSITION OF MAXIMUM ACTION IN THE EASTERN QUADRANT THEN TLHEY WILL RETURN IN DECLINATION BEFORE THE COLD UNTIL BOTH IT AND THE LINE OR NEEDLE ARE IN THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AFTER WHICH AS THE COLD TRAVELS ON WESTWARD THE NEEDLE WILL FOLLOW IT WEST UNTIL THE COLD HAS ATTAINED ITS PLACE OF MAXIMUM ACTION IN THE WEST QUADRANT 2982 AND THENATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMGENERAL PRINCIPLES AS THE COLD RETREATS THE NEEDLE WILL RETURN EAST TO ITS MEAN PLACE ASSUMING THAT THERE IS NO OTHER ACTION FOR THE TIME THAN THAT OF THE COLD REGION THE UPPER END OF THE FREE NEEDLE THEREFORE AT ANY GIVEN PLACE WILL TEND TOWARDS THE COLD REGION JUST AS BEFORE IT TENDEDFROM A WARM REGION AND AS THE DECLINATION IS AFFECTED SO ALSO THE IN CLINATION WILL BE IF THE COLD BE ON THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN OF A PLACE WITHIN THE TROPICS AS ST HELENA OR SINGAPORE IT WILL INCREASE THE DIP THERE WHILST AT THE SAME MOMENT IT IS DIMINISHING THE DIP AT PLACES SOUTH OR NORTH OF IT HAVING CONSIDERABLE DIP A RESULT WHICH FOLLOWS DIRECTLY FROM THE INFLECTION OF THE LINES OF FORCE INTO OR TOWARDS THE COLD REGION 3005 THE CHIEF REGIONS OF HEAT AND COLD ON THE SAME PARALLEL OF LATITUDE DO NOT FOLLOW EACH OTHER AT EQUAL INTERVALS OF TIME IT IS DIFFICULT TO MAKE A JUDGEMENT REGARDING THEIR INTERVAL IN THE ATMOSPHERE ABOVE BUT THE MAXIMUM OF COLD ON THE EARTH FOR THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS IS ASSUMED BY MANY AS BEING SEVENTEEN HOURS AFTER THE PRECEDING NOON AND ONLY SEVEN HOURS FROM THE COMING NOON THIS BRINGS INTO CON SIDERATION THE JOINT EFFECT OF HOT AND COLD R EGIONS IN DEFLECTING THE LINES OF FORCE ESPE CIALLY DURING THE FORENOON AND MIDDLE OF THE DAY IF A COLD REGION BE ONLY THREE AND A HALF HOURS WEST OF A PLACE AT THE SAMNE TIME THAT THE WARM REGION IS THREE AND A HALF HOURS EAST OF IT IT IS VERY MANIFEST THAT THE JOINT EFFECT OF THE TWO FOR BOTH ACT THEN TO CAUSE THE SAME DEFLECTION WILL BE FAR GREATER THAN THAT OF THE HEAT OR COLD ALONE OR THAN ANY CORRESPONDING EFFECT AT OTHER PERIODS FOR NEITHER TWELVE HOURS AFTER NOR AT ANY OTHER TIME WILL THERE BE AN EQUIVALENT CONDITION OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO IT IS ALSO FOR OTHER COMBINATIONS OF HOT AND COLD REGIONS THE EFFECT OF WHICH WILL VARY BOTH BY POSITION AND BY THEIR EXTENT A FREE NEEDLE IS HELD IN TENSION BY THE LINES WHICH ARE THEMSELVES GOVERNED BY THE HOT AND COLD REGIONS OF ATMOSPHERE IT PROBABLY NEVER OCCUPIES ITS MEAN PLACE BUT IS ALWAYS IN THE RESULTANT OF THESE EVERPRESENT AND EVER VARYING CAUSES OF CHANGE 3006 AS THE EARTH REVOLVES UNDER THE SUN EACH PLACE WOULD HAVE SPEAKING GENE RALLY A MAXIMUM AND A MINIMUM OF TEMPERATAURE FOR ITS ATIMOSPHERE IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS BUT LOOKING AT THE GLOBE AS A WHOLE THERE WOULD BE ONE MAXIMUM AND TWO MINIMA I E THERE WOULD BE A MAXIMUM REGION SOMEWHERE BENEATH THE SUN IN HIS PATH AND A MINIMUM IN EACH OF THE POLAR REGIONS WHICH AS REGARDS THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS WOULD NOT BE AT THE POLE BUT IN SOME PLACE OF HIGH LATITUDE AND PERHAPS AS BEFORE SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS BEFORE NOON THESE COLD REGIONS WILL BE VERY SERIOUSLY AFFECTED IN THEIR EXTENT AND PLACE AND POWER BY THE POSITION OF THE SUN BETWEEN THE TROPICS FOR AS HE ADVANCES TO ONE TROPIC THE COLD REGION THERE WILL DIMINISH IN EXTENT AND FORCE WHILST THE OTHER WILL GROW UP IN IMPORTANCE AND WHILST THEY THUS VARY IN THEIR POWER OF INFLUENCING THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF THE LINES OF FORCE THEY WILL VARY IN THEIR OWN POSITION ALSO AND HAVE AT DIFFERENT TIMES VERY VARIOUS RELATIONS OF PLACE TO THE SUN IN DIFFERENT MONTHS AND SO PRODUCE VERY VARIOUS EFFECTS IT IS THESE DIF FERENCES WHICH ARE MADE MANIFEST TO US AS I BELIEVE IN THE NIGHT AND MORNING ACTIONS AT THE NUMEROUS OBSERVATORIES SCATTERED OVER THE GLOBE 9596 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES 1N ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII 3007 I WILL PROCEED TO APPLY THESE VIEWS AND THE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE GAINED BY EXPERIMENT TO THE LOCALITIES FORMERLY CONSIDERED AND TO SOME NEW ONES BETWEEN THE TROPICS FOR THE PURPOSE OF EXPLAINING IF I CAN THE PRINCIPLES OF NIGHT ACTION OF IE TARDATION MORE OR LESS OF THE EFFECTS IN RELATION TO LOCAL TIME OF THE DIFFERENCE IN DIRECTION OF THE DECLINATION VARIATION IN DIFFERENT MONTHS FOR THE SAME PLACE AT THE SAMNE HOURS AS POINTED OUT BY COLONEL SABINE OF THE DIMINUTION OF DIP IN ONE PLACE AND INCREASE OF IT AT ANOTHER FOR THE SAME LOCAL TIME IN DOING SO IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO REFER CONTINUALLY TO THAT PLACE WHICH MAY BE CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF THE STATION AS THE CENTRE OF HOT OR COLD ACTION FOR THE TIME I WILL ENDEAVOUR TO USE THE WORD REGION FOR THAT PURPOSE MEANING THEREBY NOT THE WHOLE EXTENT OF HEATED OR WARMNED AIR NOR THE CENTRE BUT THE CHIEF PLACE OF THE ALTERED PORTION IT IS VERY MANIFEST THAT IN SOME DAYS IN MARCH OR SEPTEMBER ALL THE AIR THAT IS EAST OF THE MERIDIAN AT 21H OR 22H MAY BE CONSIDERED WARM IN COMPARISON OF THAT WHICH IS THEN WEST OF THE SAME MERIDIAN AND THAT A RESULTANT OF ACTION WHICH SHALL BE THE SANME FOR ALL PLACES CAN NOT EXIST 3008 WE ARE TO REMERNBER THAT THE EASTENING AND THE WESTENING OF THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE OF WHICH I ALWAYS SPEAK IS PRODUCED IN TWO WAYS THE NEEDLE TRAVELS AS POSITIVELY BY THE WITHDRAWAL OF A DIRECT CAUSE OF ACTION AS IT DOES UNDER THE IMME DIATE DIRECT ACTION OF THAT CAUSE BUT IN THE CONTRARY DIRECTION 2982 A WESTENING MAY BE THE RESULT EITHER OF THE COMING UP OF THE SUN ON THE EAST OF THE PLACE OF OB SERVATION OR OF ITS WITHDRAWAL IN THE WEST AFTER HE HAS PASSED OVER THE MRNEIDIAN AND PRODUCED THE GREAT EAST SWING 3009 ST PETERSBURGH HAS A MEAN DECLINATION OF 6 10 W AND A DIP OF 70 30 N THEREFORE THOUGH THE MAGNETIC AND ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIANS ARE NOT VERY OBLIQUE TO EACH OTHER STILL THE SUN OR WARM REGION REACHES THE FORUER FROM 20 TO 40 BEFORE THE LATTER AND HENCE THE TIME OF THE GREAT SUNSWING WHICH IS FROM 20 TO 1 OCLOCK IS MADE EARLIER THAN IT OTHERWISE WOULD BE THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR OF THE NEEDLE 2977 FORMS A AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 40 WITH THE EARTHS EQUATOR AND BEING THUS TILTED IT DISPOSES THE TWO QUADRANTS CHIEFLY CONCERNED IN THE DAILY VARIATION 2979 SO THAT IN THE ST PETERSBURGH SUMMER THE WARMEST REGION IS NOT ONLY FAR NEARER TO THE NEEDLE BUT PASSES THROUGH THE STRONGEST PLACES OF ACTION OF THE QUADRANTS WHEREAS IN WINTER IT IS FURTHER OFF AND ALSO IN MUCH WEAKER POSITIONS SENCE A CAUSE AS I BELIEVE OF THE GLEAT DIFFERENCE IN THE AMOUNT OF VARIATION OF DECLINATION AND ALSO IN ITS CHLARACTER IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND JANUARY IT IS FROM 4A47 TO 4 65 ONLY WHILST IN JUNE IT IS 1 1152 SEE THE TABLES P 82 AND THE CURVES PLATE II 3010 IN DECEMBER OR JANUARY BEING ST PETERSBURGH WINTER THE SUNSWING EAST  THE EASTENING AND WESTENING OF A FREE DIPPINGNEEDLE ARE NOT PROPERLY REPRESENTED BY THE MOVEMENTS OF A HORIZONTAL NEEDLE INASMUCH AS AT PLACES WITH DIFFERENT DIP THE ANGLE IS READ OFF ON PLANES DIFFERENTLY INCLINED TO THE DIP ITSELF AND IN HIGH LATITUDES THE EFFECT IS GREATLY EXAGGERATED BUT THOUGH DIFFERENT PLACES MAY NOT BE COMPARED WITHOUT A CORRECTION THE VARIATIONS FOR THE SAME PLACE AS ST PETERSBURGH ARE COMPARABLE AND PRO PORTIONATE9 2L12 912Z2974T JAJ 2 PNI DWIAAL A119 Q4AA UIV Y  I I 1  IL4 41 I IS 4 7  I1 3A4 I

EFFECTST PETERSBURGH 97 ALMOST DISAPPEARS IT IS OVER BY 1 OCLOCK AFTER WHICH THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE FOLLOWS THE SUN UNTIL 9H HAVING PASSED ITS MEAN POSITION AT 511 IT THEN STOPS AFTER WHICH IT MOVES EAST UNTIL 16H OR 17H THEN AGAIN STOPS OR NEARLY SO UNTIL 21H AND THEN THE SUNSWING COMES ON CARRYING IT TO EXTREME EAST SO HERE THERE ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT POINTS TO EXPLAIN NAMELY WHY THE NEEDLE MOVES EASTWARD AFTER 9H AND WHY IT DOES NOT TRAVEL WESTWARD FROM 13H TO 20H BUT ON THE CONTRARY IS TRAVELLING EASTWARDS OR STANDING STILL THE EXPLANATION ACCORDING TO MY VIEW IS AS FOLLOWS ST PETERSBURGH IS A PLACE IN WHICH FROM ITS POSITION THE UPPER COLD CONSEQUENT UPON TTLE DAILY WITH DRAWAL OF THE SUN WOULD PRODUCE A PARAMAGNETIC ACTION 2994 3003 THIS ACTION AS THE SUN SET WOULD BEGIN TO APPEAR ON THE EAST AND I CONCLUDE THAT AT 9HLLH THE COLD REGION COMING UP FIROM THE EAST NOT ON THE LATITUDE OF THE SUNS PATH WHICH IS FAR TO THE SOUTH BUT PROBABLY NEAR TO THAT OF ST PETERSBULRGL ITSELF IS ABLE AT 91I 1 OCLOCK DURING WHICH THE NEEDLE IS STATIONARY TO COUNTERACT ANY RERNAINING TENDENCY WEST WARD AND AFTER THAT TO DRAW THE LINE OF FORCE AND THE NEEDLE END EASTWARD UNTIL 17 OCLOCK AND TO HOLD IT THERE AFTER WHICH THE SUN SENDS IT EASTWARD IN THE GREAT SWING THAT THE COLD CONSIDERING ITS PROBABLE POSITION MAY WELL DIRECT THE NEEDLE END EAST WARD TILL 17H1 AND THE SUN REGION NOT SEND IT WESTWARD FROM 1711 TO 201 OR 21H IS SEEN I THINK TO BE A VERY NATURAL CONSEQUENCE OF THE PROBABLE POSITION OF THE TWO REGIONS BETWEEN THESE HOURS FOR LETTING THE SUN WHOSE PLACE WE KNOW REPRESENT THE WARM REGION AT 17H HE IS THEN IN THE EASTERN QUADRANT BELOW THE HORIZON SO THAT IF HE COULD AFFECT THE NEEDLE THROUGH OR ROUND THE EARTH 2995 IT WOULD BE TO EASTEN IT AND IT CONTINUES IN THAT QUADRANT UNTIL 19H THEN AT 1911 WHEN HE ENTERS THE QUADRANT IN WHICH HE BEGINS TO EXERT A WESTENING ACTION ON THE SUN HE IS IN SUCH A POSITION AS RESPECTS THE NEEDLE AT ST PETERSBURGH AS IS SEEN BY A LINE DRAWN OVER THE SURFACE OF THE GLOBE 2996 AND COMPARED WITH THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND DIP AND IN SO INEFFICIENT A PART OF THE QUADRANT 2982 AND ALSO SO FAR OFF THAT IT HAS NO POWER TO SEND THE NEEDLE WESTWARD BUT ONLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RETIEATING COLD REGION TO HOLD IT THERE UNTIL AT 21H OR THEREABOUT THE SUNSWING FIOM WEST TO EAST OCCURS AS IN OTHER CASES AFTER THIS THE NEEDLE FOLLOWS THE SUN FROM 1 OCLOCK BEING AS THE HOURS ADVANCE GRADUALLY ARRESTED AND TAKEN UP BY THE COLD REGION OF THE NEXT TWENTYFOUR HOURS AS ALREADY DESCRIBED 3011 I HAVE CONSIDERED THE COLD EASTENING AS CONTINUED UNTIL AS LATE AS 17H WHICH WOULD IMPLY PROBABLY THAT UNTIL THAT HOUR THE COLD REGION WAS EAST OF ST PETERSBURGH IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO SPEAK EVEN IN A GENERAL MANNER OF THE PLACES OR TIMES OF THINGS SO LITTLE IDENTIFIED AS YET AS THE WARM AND COLD REGIONS IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE BUT REFERRING TO THE TEMPERATURES ON THE EARTH AT ST PETERSBURGH I MAY POINT OUT THAT THE EXTREME COLD IS IN THE MONTH OF JANUARY AS LATE AS 19 AND 20 OCLOCK ANDJIVE HOURS LATER THAN IT IS IN THE SUMMNER MONTHS I MAY ALSO POINT OUT HERE FOR USE IN THE SUM MER MONTHS THAT THE MAXIMUM HEAT VARIES THREE HOURS IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION SO  THE ST PETERSBURGH OBSERVATIONS ARE AT 21 MINUTES AFTER EACH HOUR BUT I MENTION THE HOUR WITHOUT THE MINUTES AS SUFFICIENT FOR A GENERAL STATEMENT MDCCCLI 098 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII THAT WHILST FROM THE HIGHEST TO THE LOWEST TEMPERATURE IN THE DAY IS ONLY ELEVEN HOURS IN SUNMER IT IS NINETEEN HOURS IN WINTER AS MAY BE SEEN BY THE TEMPERATURE TABLE P 83 AS THE DAY COMES ON THEREFORE IN JANUARY THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE IS ONLY FIVE HOURS AFTER THE LOWEST WHICH ACCORDS GENERALLY WITH THE ASSUMED CAUSE OF THE EFFECTS ON THE NEEDLE  3012 AS I AM ENDEAVOURING TO MAKE ST PETERSBURGH A GENERAL CASE OF NIGHT ACTION FOR THE EXPLANATION OF CORRESPONDING EFFECTS AT OTHER PLACES SO I MAY NOTICE THAT THE NIGHT ACTION MUST CONTAIN A PORTION OF SUN EFFECT WHICH COMBINES WITH THAT OF THE COLD THE ACTIGN OF THE SUN IS KNOWN BY OBSERVATION TO BE VERY EXTENDED IN THE CASE OF ST PETERSBURGH THE SUN WHEN AT THE SOUTHERN TROPIC AND ON THE MERIDIAN IS BETWEEN 80 AND 90 FROM THE STATION AND YET WE SEE BY THE OBSERVATIONS AND CURVES HOW LARGE AN EFFECT HE PRODUCES 3009 WHEREVER THE SUN MAY BE HE IS BY HIS MOTION CAUSING CHANGES WHICH ARE FELT SIMULTANEOUSLY OVER THE WHOLE GLOBE AND AT 9 AND 10 OCLOCK HE IS IN AN EFFECTUAL PART OF THAT QUADRANT WHICH WOULD SEND THE NEEDLE EASTWARD IF THE EARTH WERE REPLACED BY AIR AND IN THE REPRESENTATIVE EXPERI MENTS WITH A HELIX 2995 DOES SO SEND IT EASTWARD WHEN A MAGNET IS INTERPOSED THE NIGHT ACTION OUGHT THEREFORE TO BE GREATEST IN WINER AS IT IS BECAUSE THE COLD IS THEN NOST INTENSE AND ALSO BECAUSE THE ACTION OF THE DISTANT SUN COINCIDES WITH IT IT IS VERY PROBABLE THAT MANY OF THE CURIOUS CONTORTIONS OF THE NIGHT ACTION WHICH APPEAR IN THE CURVES OF HOBARTON TORONTO AND ELSEWHERE MAY DEPEND UPON THE MANNER IN WHICH AT DIFFERENT HOURS THESE TWO CAUSES PROBABLY WITH OTHERS COMBINE TOGETHER 3013 THOUGH THE DECLINATION VARIES LITTLE OR NOTHING BETWEEN 17H AND 21H NO WESTENING THEN APPEARING 3010 STILL I SHOULD EXPECT A MARKED ACTION ON THE IN CLINATION AT THAT TIME AND CONCLUDE THAT IT WILL BE ON THE INCREASE BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN A TABLE OF THE DAILY VARIATION OF INCLINATION 3014 IN THE MONTH OF FEBRUARY THE SAME REMARKS APPLY BUT AS THE SUN IS NOW COINING FROM THE SOUTHERN SIGNS AND DRAWING NEARER TO ST PETERSBURGH ITS POWER IS IN CREASING AND THIS IS SHOWN BY MAKING THE COLD EASTENING FOR 15H 16H AND 17H LESS IN EXTENT THAN BEFORE BRE BY MORE THAN HALF A MINUTE OF A DEGREE AND BY ABSOLUTELY OVER COMING IT AND MAKING A RETURN WESTWARDS BETWEEN 1711 AND 18H BEFORE THE SWING TO THE EAST COMES ON IN MARCH THE EFFECT IS STILL MORE STRIKING THE PARAINAGNETIC EAST ENING IS ARRESTED AT 14H AND THE FOLLOWING DIAMNAGNETIC WESTENING EXTENDS TO 20H THEN FOLLOWS THE SWING IN APRIL THE WESTENING BY THE WARM REGION IS AS EARLY AS 13H AND CONTINUES TO 20H BEING VERY STRONG IT IS INTERESTING TO LOOK AT THE TABLE OF TEMPERA TURES FOR THESE MONTHS EVEN AS THEY ARE OBTAINED AT THE EARTHS SURFACE AS THE MONTHS  IN RELATION TO THE COLD OF THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE AND THE OCCURRENCE OF ITS MAXIMUM AT CERTAIN LEVELS AT LEAST NOT AT MIDNIGHT BUT HOURS AFTER HOW OFTEN DO WE IN THIS COUNTRY SEE A CLEAR BRIGHT NIGHT AND THEN JUST BEFORE THE SUN RISES THE FORMATION OF A VEIL OF CLOUDS HIGH UP AND UPON HIS APPEARING THEIR DISSOLUTION AND PASSING AWAY T IN THESE CASES THE CLOUDS SHOW THE TIME OF GREATEST COLD ABOVE BY THEIR FORMATION AND BY THEIR DISSOLUTION ITS QUICK REVERSION AND CHANGE INTO INCREASING WARMTHATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMST PETERSBURGH VARIATIONS COME ON THE EASTENING FROM THE COLD CEASES SOONER AND SOONER BEING IN JANUARY AND APRIL 17H AND 13H RESPECTIVELY THE MINIMUM OF TEMPERATURE ALSO RETREATS BEING FOR THE SAME MONTH 20H AND 16 ON THE CONTRARY THE MAXIMUM OF HEAT ADVANCES FROM THE WINTER TO THE SUMMER MONTHS BEING ALSO GREATLY INCREASED  AND THE EFFECT ON THE SUNSWING IS SEEN BOTH IN THE ADVANCED TIME OF CHANGE AND THE INCREASED AMOUNT OF VARIATION 3015 IN MAY AND TJUNE THE NIGHT OR COLD EASTENING HAS DISAPPEARED OR IS SHOWN ONLY BY A LITTLE HESITATION AND FROM MIDNIGHT THE COMING ON OF THE SUN REGION SETS THE NEEDLE END WEST IF WE LOOK AT THE GLOBE 2996 WE SHOULD BE LED TO EXPECT THAT IT WOULD DO THIS THE SUN IS THEN IN THE NORTHERN TROPIC NEARLY WHEELING ROUND ST PETERSBULGH AND COMPARATIVELY NEAR TO IT AND A FREE DIPPINGNEEDLE WOULD IN TWENTYFOUR HOURS MAKE ONE REVOLUTION IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS THE SUN REGION BUT AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THE LINE JOINING THE TWO TOGETHER IF THE NEEDLE WERE AT THE ASTRONOMICAL POLE OF THE EARTH HAVING GREAT DIP IT WOULD DESCRIBE ALMOST A CIRCLE WITH NEARLY UNIFORM MOTION BUT BEING REALLY MUCH NEARER TO THE WARM REGION IN ONE PART OF THE UNIFORM DAILY COURSE OF THE LATTER THAN ANOTHER THE RADIUS VECTOR JOINING IT WITH THE REGION THEN MAKES A MUCH GREATER ANGLE IN A GIVEN TIME THAN WHEN IT IS FUR THER OFF AND HENCE THE GREATER RAPIDITY OF THE MOTION BETWEEN 2011 AND LH AND THE PRODUCTION OF WHAT I HAVE FAMILIARLY CALLED THE SUNSWING FROM WEST TO EAST 3016 IT WILL BE SEEN FIOM THE TABLE OF CURVES PLATE II THAT WE HAVE AT ST PETERS BURGH A FINE EXAMPLE OF THAT KIND OF RESULT WHICH COLONEL SABINE CALLED ATTENTION TO SO STRONGLY IN HIS PAPER UPON THE ST HELENA PHENOMENA AND THOSE OCCURRING AT HOBARTON TORONTO AND ELSEWHERE NAMELY A DECLINATION VARIATION IN DIFERENT DIREC TIONS FOR THE SAME HOURS IN DIFFERENT MONTHS THUS IN THE PRESENT CASE THE NEEDLE END GOES EASTWARD FOR THE HOURS 1311 TO 20H IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DECETNBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WHILST IT GOES WEST FOR THE SAME HOURS IN APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST MARCH AND SEPTEMBER CURVES FALL MIDWAY BUT THIS DIFFERENCE IS NOW I HOPE BY THE HYPOTHESIS ACCOUNTED FOR 3010 3015 AND I TRUST THAT EQUALLY SATISFACTORY REASONS WILL APPEAR FOR ST HELENA 3045 AND OTHER PLACES 3022 3039 3065 3017 THE PARAMAGNETIC CHARACTER OF THE EASTENING EFFECT BY COLD IN THE WINTER MONTHS AFTER 10 OCLOCK WOULD PROBABLY BE ILLUSTRATED BY INCLINATION OBSERVATIONS FOR THE SAME TIME FOR IF THE COLD REGION PASSES TO THE SOUTH OF ST PETERSBURGH THE INCLINA TION WILL BE DECREASED BY THE PARAMAGNETIC ACTION BUT INCREASED BY THE DIANMAGNETIC RESULTANT AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THESE TWO ELEMENTS OF DIRECTION I E INCLINATION AND DECLINATION ARE COMBINED AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE FULL ELUCIDATION OF THE MAGNETIC EFFECT OF THE ATMOSPHERE I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GIVE THESE DATA FOR ST PETERSBURGH THE TOTAL FORCE VARIATIONS WOULD ALSO HELP GREATLY TO CLEAR UP THE SUBJECT INDEED IT IS NOT FAIR TO ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN THE RESULTS OF THE ASSIGNED CAUSE BY TAKING ONLY ONE ELEMENT OF THREE INTO CONSIDERATION WHAT WE RE QUIRE ULTIMATELY TO KNOW IS ALL THE CHANGES OF A FREE NEEDLE IN POSITION AND IN RESPECT  PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1847 P 51 O2 99100 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII OF POWER ALL ARE IMPORTANT AND ALL SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AT ONCE I PRESUME THAT THE THEORY OF THE VARIATIONS CANNOT ADVANCE VERY FAR WITHOUT THEIR JOINT CONSIDERA TION 3018 GREENWICH PRESENTS A FINE CASE OF THE NIGHT EPISODE AND THE DIFFERENT DIREC TIONS OF THE MAGNETIC VARIATION FOR THE SAME HOURS IN DIFFERENT MONTHS IN THESE RESPECTS IT IS VERY MUCH LIKE ST PETERSBURGH BUT HAS GREAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST BECAUSE OF THE LARGE WESTERN DECLINATION AND THE EFFECT PRODUCED BY IT ON THE PLACES OF THE ACTIVE QUADRANTS 2979 3000 AND THE TIMES OF THE VARIATION PHENOMENA ON SETTING UP ITS POSITION ON THE GLOBE 2996 IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE EQUATORIAL PLANE IS NOT LIKELY TO BE MUCH CONCERNED IN THE MIDDAY ACTION AND THAT THE SUN OR WARM REGION PASSES NEARLY ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE TWO CHIEF QUADRANTS IN SUMMER WHICH WITH ITS NEARNESS AT THE SAME TIME OUGHT TO MAKE THE MIDDAY SWING TO EAST VERY GREAT IN WINTER IT IS FURTHER OFF AND IN MUCH WEAKER PARTS OF THE QUADRANT SO THAT THE SWING OUGHT TO BE FAR LESS AND SUCH IS THE CASE THE GREATEST SUMMER VARIATION IS 1 130 AND THE LEAST WINTER VARIATION ONLY 588 IN APRIL MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST THE GREAT WEST DECLINATION OF THE SOUTH OR UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS AT 191 20 AND THE CHIEF EAST POSITION AT 1H 20 THE LATTER POSITION REMAINS THE SAME ALL THE YEAR ROUND BUT THE EXTREME WESTENING IS IN THE OTHER SEVEN COLD MONTHS AT 9H 20 AND ILH 20T OR VERGING TOWARDS MIDNIGHT IT THEN SURPASSING THE MORNING WEST DEFLECTION THUS THE SUNS EFFECT IN SUMMER IN WEAKENING THE COLD NIGHT EFFECT 3005 IS VERY EVIDENT AND SO ALSO IS THE MANNER IN WHICH THE NIGHT ACTION GROWS UP UNTIL VERY PROMINENT IN THE WINTER MONTHS THROUGH THE STRENGTHENING OF THE COLD ACTION 3006 WHEN THE SUN IS TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN TROPIC AND IN THE WEAKER PARTS OF THE SEGMENTS THE ASSUMED PRINCIPLES OF THIS ACTION HAVE BEEN ALREADY GIVEN IN THE CASE OF ST PETERS BURGH 3010 C 3019 THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS MUCH TO THE EAST OF THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN WHERE THE WARM REGION PASSES IT ESPECIALLY IN WINTER FOR THEN THE SUN CROSSES IT ABOUT 10 OCLOCK AND IN SUMMER ABOUT 11 OCLOCK HENCE THE SWING OUGHT TO BE EARLIER IN WINTER THAN IN SUMNMER THOUGH BECAUSE OF THE SLOWER ANGULAR MOTION OF THE WARM REGION IN RELATION TO GREENWICH 3015 IT OUGHT THEN TO OCCUPY A LONGER TIME AND YET AS ABOVE SAID 3018 BE BY REASON OF DISTANCE OF SMALLER AMOUNT ALL THIS AP PEARS TO ACCORD REMARKABLY WITH THE FACT THE SWING BEGINS AT 171 IN THE WINTER BUT NOT UNTIL 19H IN THE SUMMER AND ENDING AT THE SAME HOUR AT BOTH SEASONS NAMELY 1 OCLOCK IS MUCH LONGER IN ITS OCCURRENCE IN WINTER THAN IN SUMMER IT BEGINS EARLIER BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS SOONER PASSED THAN IN SUMMER AND THE REASON ALSO APPEARS WHY THE EXTENSION IN TIME IS AT THE BEGINNING RATHER THAN AT THE TERMINATION OF THE SWING FOR BECAUSE OF THE DECLINATION THE WARM REGION IS AT THE SAME HOURS MUCH LESS EAST OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IN THE MORNING AND MUCH FURTHER WEST OF IT  MEAN DECLINATION 22 51 W MEAN INCLINATION 69 N  SEE THE CURVES PLATE II THE OBSERVATIONS ARE ONLY FOR EVERY TWO HOURS SO THAT NO DEGREE OF NICETY CAN BE EXPECTED IN ASSIGNING THE TIME OF ANY GIVEN CHANGEATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMGREENWICH VARIATIONS IN THE AFTERNOON IN WINTER THAN IN SUTNMER HENCE THE SWING IS THROWN FORWARD IN TIME IN WINTER AND THOUGH PROLONGED ITS TERMINATION COINCIDES WITH THE TERMINATION IN SUMMER AS FAR AT LEAST AS THESE TWOHOUR OBSERVATIONS CAN INDICATE 3020 AS THE REGION PRECEDES THE SUN THE DEGREE OF MEAN DECLINATION HERE OUGHT TO MAKE THE DAYSWING COME ON EARLY I E EARLIER THAN AT ILOBARTON AND ESPECIALLY EARLIER THAN AT TORONTO UNLESS OTHER CAUSES OF VARIATION INTERFERE NOW THE BEGIN NING IS EARLIER THAN AT TORONTO BUT THE END THE SAME BOTH THE BEGINNING AND THE END IS AN HOUR EARLIER THAN AT HOBARTON THE LATTER DIFFERENCE I BELIEVE DUE TO THE DIFFER ENCE OF MEAN DECLINATION AT TORONTO I THINK WE SHALL FIND ANOTHER CAUSE INFLUENCING THE TIME 3032 3021 WE AIE TO REMEMBER ALSO THAT IN WINTER THE SUN OR WARM REGION PASSES THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN TWO HOURS BEFORE HE PASSES THE ASTRONOMICAL MNERIDIAN AND THERE FORE HIS EFFECT IN GIVING WEST POSITION TO THE SOUTH OR UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE CEASES LONG BEFORE IT DOES IN SUMRER AND PERHAPS EVEN BEFORE IT CEASES TO COME NEARER AND SO THE EASTERN AFTEREFFECT ON IT OUGHT TO BE GREATER WHICH IT IS THIS EASTERN EFFECT SHOULD BE STRENGTHENED ALSO BECAUSE THE ACTION OF THE WARM REGION ON THE NEEDLE OUGLHT TO BE COMPARATIVELY GREAT AFTER PASSING THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN FOR ITS PATH FORMS AN OBTUSE ANGLE WITH THE MERIDIAN BEFORE THE PASSAGE AND AN ACUTE ONE AFTERWARDS 3000 AND THEREFORE IS MORE POWERFUL TO ALL THESE CAUSES OF ACTION WILL BE ADDED THE EFFECT FOR THE TIME OF THE COLD IN THE DISTANT WEST 3005 3022 THE CASE OF DIFFERENCE OF DIRECTION BEFORE 19H 3016 IS VERY MARKED AT GREENWICH AS MAY BE SEEN BY LOOKING AT THE CURVES FOR THE MONTHS PLATE II THE SOUTH OR UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE GOES WEST IN MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST FROM 1211 TO 19H I E FROM MRIDNIGHT TO FIVE HOURS BEFORE NOON BUT IN OCTOBER NOVEMBER DE CEMBER AND JANUARY IT IS EASTENING AT THE SAME HOURS CONSIDERING FIRST A SUMMER MONTH AS JUNE THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS WESTWARD AS THE SUN COMES ONWARD AS IT OUGHT TO BE UNTIL 19H WHEN HE IS ALMOST IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS PASSAGE THROUGH THE EAST QUADRANT AND IN RESPECT OF DISTANCE AND ANGULAR RELATION TO THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THE WAIRM REGION IS THEN PROBABLY IN THE PLACE OF GREATEST POWER TO PRO DUCE WESTENING OF THE NEEDLE END IN THE NIEXT SIX HOURS THE NEEDLE PASSES TO EX TREME EAST PERFORMLING ACCORDING TO THE OBSERVATIONS A FOURTH OF THE WHOLE SWING IN THE FIRST TWO HOURS A HALF IN THE NEXT TWO AND A FOURTH IN THE REMAINING TWO THE JOURNEY BEING NO DOUBT WITH FIRST RAPIDLY INCREASING AND THEN RAPIDLY DIMINISHING VELOCITY IN THIS TRANSIT OF THE REGION THE SUN IS FOR ABOUT TWOTHIRDS OF THE TIME IN THE EASTERN QUADRANT AND ONETHIRD IN THE WESTERN AND HIS PATH IN THE LATTER THIRD FORMS ALMOST THE BASE OF AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGLE WITH GREENWICH HAVING THE MAGNETIC MLERIDIAN FOR ONE SIDE SO THAT ALL THAT TIME IT IS CLOSE TO AND THEREFORE HAS STRONG ACTION ON THE NEEDLE 3000 THE SUN IS AT 1H IN SUCH A POSITION AS RESPECTS THIS ANGLE THAT IF  IT MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN THAT THE RETURN FROM AN EXTREME EAST OR WEST POSITION IS NOT WHEN THE SUN OR WARM REGION PASSES BY A NEUTRAL LINE OR FROM ONE QUADRANT TO ANOTHER BUT WHEN IT PASSES ITS POINT OF GREATEST ACTION IN A QUADRANT 2982 101102 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII WE ASSUME THE REGION TO BE SOMEWHAT IN ADVANCE OF IT THE LATTER WOULD BE IN THAT PLACE WHERE IT COULD EXERT ITS MAXIMUMN EASTENING EFFECT AND THEREFORE AFTER THAT AS IT RECEDES WESTWARDS WOULD LET THE NEEDLE RETURN FROM EAST TO WEST AS IT DOES FOLLOWING IT THE NEEDLE CONTINUES TO GO WEST PASSING ITS MEAN PLACE FOR THE MONTH ABOUT 7 IN THE MEANTIME BEFORE THAT AT A LITTLE AFTER 6 OCLOCK THE SUN HAS LEFT THE WESTERN SEGMENT BY PASSING THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR IT HAS NOT YET SET TO GREENWICH AND IF IT HAVE ANY ACTION IT WILL BECAUSE OF THE SEGMENT IT IS NOW IN 2979 STILL BE TO CARRY THE NEEDLE END WESTWARD THE END IN FACT CONTINUES TO GO WESTWARD SLOWLY ONLY AFTER 10 OCLOCK GAINING A LITTLE FROM 10OH TO 1511 AND THEN AS THE SUN COMES UP PASSING MORE RAPIDLY WEST AS IT OUGHT TO DO UNTIL 19H AND FINALLY MAKING THE GREAT SWING TO THE EAST AS BEFORE THE WHOLE PROGRESSION HERE IS VERY SIMPLE AND APPARENTLY A NATURAL RESULT OF THE ASSUMED CAUSE EFFECTS OF COOLING NO DOUBT COME IN BUT THE COLD REGION HAS DIMINISHED IN INTENSITY AND EXTENT 3006 HAS RETREATED NORTHWARD AND ITS ACTION APPEARS IN COMBINING WITH THE FORMER TO PRODUCE ONLY VARIATIONS IN THE VELOCITY OF THE CHANGE 3023 THEN FOR THE WINTER LET US CONSIDER JANUARY AND AS THE EASTENING IS A MAXIMRUM IN ALL THE MONTHS AT 1 OCLOCK AFTER THE SUNS PASSAGE ACROSS THE MERIDIAN LET US BEGIN THE CYCLE THERE AT 1H THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS AT EXTREME EAST AND THE AMOUNT OF THE VARIATION NOT HALF WHAT IT WAS IN SUMMER THE SUN BEING NOW FAR OFF THE SUN AND WARM REGION PASS THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN ABOUT 21H OR 22H AND THEREFORE IN THE HOURS BEFORE AND AFTER THAT SHOULD PRODUCE THE FULL WEST TO EAST EFFECT AT 1 OCLOCK THE NEEDLE RETURNS WEST FOLLOWING THE RETREATING SUN AND DOES SO QUICKLY FOR SEVEN OR EIGHT HOURS OR UP TO 9GH DURING WHICH TIME THE WARM RE GION AND ALSO THE EARLY MORNING COLD REGION ARE IN QUADRANTS AND POSITIONS WHICH IF THEY HAVE ANY ACTION AT ALL LIKE THAT REFERRED TO IN THE EXPERIMENTS 2975 2995 WOULD THEN SET OR HOLD THE NEEDLE END WEST OF ITS MEAN POSITION THEN AN ACTION OF THE FOLLOWING KIND SUPERVENES THE NEEDLE REMAINS STATIONARY UNTIL I 11 AFTER WHICH IT GOES EAST AT MIDNIGHT AND UNTIL 15 AGAIN REMAINS STATIONARY OR NEARLY SO FOR TWO HOURS THEN EASTENS AGAIN SLOWLY AT FIRST AND AFTERWARDS MRORE RAPIDLY UNTIL I1H WHLEN IT HLAS ATTAINED ITS MAXIMUM EASTENING AND THE PLACE FROM WHENCE IT SET OUT 3024 THIS NIGHT ACTION IS ANOTHER CASE OF THTE ACTION OF A COLD REGION LIKE THAT CONSIDERED IN RESPECT OF ST PETERSBURGH 3010 IT APPEARS TO ME THAT AT I11H THE IMMNEDIATE SUN ACTION AND RETURNS WEST AFTER IT WERE OVER THAT THE COLD REGION WHICH WAS COMING ROUND FROM THE EAST DID THEN ACT BY ITS PARAMAGNETIC CONDITION COM BINED WITH THE COMPLEMENTARY EFFECTS OF THE SUNS ACTION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE GLOBE AND SET THE NEEDLE EASTWARD AS IT WOULD BE COMNPETENT TO DO 2994 3010 UNTIL 14H OR 151 IN EASTENING THE NEEDLE DOES NOT ARRIVE AT THE MNEAN PLACE BUT IS STILL 1 WEST OF IT AND THE REASON WHY IT HANGS THERE FROMN 1511 TO 17H AND THEN BEGINS TO GO EAST AGAIN MNORE AND MORE UNDER THE SUNS ACTION IS PROBABLY THAT AS THE SUN RISES IN THE SOUTHIERN TROPICS HIS DISTANCE AND POSITION BRING THE RESULTING DISTANTATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMGREENWIC HHOBARTONTORONTO 103 WARM REGION GRADUALLY INTO ACTION WITH THAT OF THE NEARER COLD THAT AT FIRST HE STOPS THE ACTION OF THE LATTER AND THEN AS HE ADVANCES COTNBINES WITH AND FINALLY REPLACES IT CAUSING THE USUAL SWING TO COME ON SLOWLY AT FIRST AND THEN QUICKLY FROM WEST TO EAST BY IH HOW THIS WOULD HAPPEN IS WELL SEEN BOTH AS RESPECTS THE PLACE OF THE SUN IN THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AND IN THE TWO MAGNETIC SEGMENTS BY REFERENCE TO THE GLOBE 2996 AND THE DIAGRAM OF THE CURVES OF VARIATION PLATE II 3025 CONSIDERING ANOTHER AND AN INTERMEDIATE MOTNTH AS MARCH AT I1 THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS AT EXTREME EAST THEN UNTIL 911 IT FOLLOWS THE SUN AS BEFORE 3023 FROM 9H TO I1H IT IS STATIONARY THEN THE PARAMAGNETIC ACTION OF COLD FROM THE EAST OCCURS AND THE NEEDLE MOVES EAST UNTIL 13H IT IS THEN STOPPED AND TWO HOURS SOONER THAN BEFORE FOR THE SUN NOW APPEARS TO GREENWICH AS EARLY AS 6 OCLOCK AND IN A MORE FAVOURABLE POSITION FOR EFFECT BOTH AS REGARDS THE MRLAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND THE SEGMENT IN WHICH IT HAS FOR THE TIME ITS PLACE AND SO THE NEEDLE IS ACTUALLY SENT WEST FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS IT IS THEN ALMOST HELD STEADY UNTIL 191 AFTER WHICH THE GREAT SUNSWING OCCURS THE HOLDING WEST AND YET THE ABSENCE OF MORE WESTENING BETWEEN 15H AND 19H IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE SOUTHERN PLACE OF THE WARM REGION AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT AT THAT TIME THE DIP IS INCREASING AN EFFECT WHICH WOULD ACCORD VERY HARMONIOUSLY WITH THE CONDITION OF MATTERS AT THE TIME 3026 OTHER MONTHS ARE ON THIS OR THAT SIDE OF MARCH IN RESPECT OF THEIR EFFECTS THE CORRESPONDING MONTH ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE YEAR SEPTEMBER IS THE SAME AS MARCH EXCEPT IN THAT PORTION OF EFFECT WHICH IS CONSEQUENT UPON A MONTH FOLLOWING ONE THAT IS WARMER OR COLDER THAN ITSELF 3053 GREENWICH THEREFORE SATISFACTORILY ILLUSTRATES THE APPLICATION OF THE HYPOTHESIS TO THE CASE OF A DIFFERENCE IN DIRECTION FOR THE SAME HOUR IN DIFFERENT MONTHS 3016 3022 AND ALSO THE OCCURRENCE OF THE NIGHT EFFECT AND ITS TRANSITION INTO THE VERY MARKED EASTENING OF THE EARLY MORNING 3027 THE CASES OF HOBARTON AND TORONTO ARE SO SIMILAR THOUGH IN OPPOSITE HEMI SPHERES THAT THEY MAY BE CONSIDERED TOGETHER A VERY IMPORTANT COMPARISON OF THE PHENOMENA AT BOTH PLACES HAS BEEN ALREADY MADE BY COLONEL SABINE IN RELATION TO THE VARIATIONS OF DECLINATION INCLINATION AND TOTAL FORCE WHEN EXAMINED BY THE GLOBE 2996 THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE QUADRANTS IS NEARLY ALIKE THE SUN BEING IN TWO CHIEF EAST AND WEST QUADRANTS FROM ABOUT 18 TO 6 OCLOCK OR DURING THE DAY THE SUN IS IN MORE INFLUENTIAL PARTS OF THE QUADRANTS IN SUMMER THAN IN WINTER AND THE EFFECT IS SEEN IN THE DIFFERENCE OF THE AMOUNT OF DECLINATION VARIATION AT HOBARTON IT IS 1205 IN SUMMER AND ONLY 36 IN WINTER AT TORONTO IT IS 14 IN SUMMER AND 52 IN WINTER THE NIGHT ACTION AT BOTH IS ALIKE IN CHARACTER AND HAS BEEN SUFFI CIENTLY EXPLAINED ACCORDING TO THE HYPOTHESIS IN THE FORMER CASES 3010 3024 3028 COLONEL SABINE HAS GIVEN THE DATA BY WHICH THE VARIATIONS OF THE INCLINATION AND OF THE TOTAL FORCE AT HOBARTON AND TORONTO MAY BE COMPARED WITH AND APPLIED TO THE HYPOTHESIS BUT I HESITATE TO ENTER UPON THEM IN THIS GENERAL VIEW INASMUCH  HOBARTON OBSERVATIONS 1850 VOL I P LXVIII C ALSO PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 1847 P 55 AND 1850 PP 201 215 C SEE THE CURVES PLATE II AND TABLES FOR TORONTO PP 80 81104 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII AS THESE AND THE DECLINATION VARIATIONS SHOULD BE CLOSELY CONSIDERED AND COMPARED TOGETHER AT EVERY HOUR FOR EACH PARTICULAR PLACE THE INCLINATION VARIATION AT HIOBARTON IS GREATEST IN ITS SUNTMMER BEING THEN 2A18 AND LEAST IN WINTER OR 128 AS WAS TOBE EXPECTED THE GREAT VARIATION OCCURS IN THE DAYTIME AS WITH THE DECLINA TION THE DIP BEING MOST AS THE SUN REGION PASSES OVER THE MERIDIAN THLE GREATEST DIP IS NOT AT THE SAME LHOUR FOR ALL THE MONTHS IT OCCURS AT 23 OCLOCK FOR DECEMNBER FEBRUARY AND MARCH AT 24 OCLOCK FOR SEPTENBER AT 1 OCLOCK FOR JUNE AND JULY AS IT MOVES ON SO DO THE POINTS OF LEAST DIP ON EACH SIDE OF IT SO THAT THE WHOLE CURVE ADVANCES IN TIME IN THE ORDER OF THESE MONTHS THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER AFFECTION OF IT FOR THE QUICKEST TRANSITION IS FROM MOST TO LEAST DIP IN SOME MONTHS AS DECEMBER FEBRUARY AND FROM LEAST TO MOST DIP IN OTHER MONTHS AS JUNE JULY SEPTEMBER AT TORONTO THE DIP VARIATION THOUGH PECULIAR IN SOME POINTS MAY BE SAID TO HAVE THE SAME GENERAL CHARACTER 3029 FOR THE VARIATION OF THE TOTAL FORCE AT BOTH PLACES I WILL AT PRESENT ONLY REFER TO COLONEL SABINES VOLUMES AND THE OBSERVATIONS HE HAS MADE THEREON 3030 THEILE IS A REMARKABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TIME OF THE DAY CHANGES AT HOBARTON AND TORONTO TO WHICH COLONEL SABTNE HAS CALLED ATTENTION IT CONSISTS IN THE OCCURRENCE OF THOSE AT THE LATTER PLACE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THOSE OF THE FORMER IF THIS HAD DEPENDED UPON THE DECLINATIOT THEN THE CHANGE SLHOULD HAVE TAKEN PLACE FIRST AT HOBARTON FOR THERE THE SUN ARRIVES AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN BEFORE HE COMES TO THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN AND FOR LIKE HOURS OF LOCAL TIMNE HE IS IN A BETTER POSITION IN THE QUADRANT IN THE AFTERNOON THAN AT TORONTO STILL IT IS THE LATER OF THE TWO 3031 IF THE TIME OF THE SUNSWING FROM WEST TO EAST BE CONSIDERED THE MIDDLE OF IT OUGHT TO BE SOMEWLHERE NEAR THE PERIOD WHEN THE WARLM REGION IS PASSING THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN 2982 AND IN THAT WAY SUPPLIES AN APPROXIMATIVE EXPRESSION OF THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF THE REGION AND THE SUN THE SWING IS AT HOBARTON FIOMN 21 TO 2 OCLOCK OR FIVE HOURS AND THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS PASSED BY THE SUN NEARLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE TIME OR 23H 20 OCLOCK BUT ACCORDING TO THE SUPPOSITION JUST MADE THIS IS ALSO THE TIME AT WHICH THE WARM REGION OUGHT ALSO TO PASS AND SO THE SUN AND THE REGION IN THIS PLACE APPEAR TO ARRIVE AT THE MERIDIAN TOGETHER AT LTORONTO THE SUN SWING IS ABOUT FOUR HOURS IN WINTER OR FROM 21 TO 1 OCLOCK AND FIVE HOURS IN SUMMER OR FIOM 20 TO 1 OCLOCK OF THE LATTER FIVE HOURS THE MIDDLE IS 22 OCLOCK AT WHICH TIME THE REGION OUGHT TO PASS OVER THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND AS THAT COIN CIDES NEARLY WITH THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN IT APPEARS THAT THE REGION IS ABOUT 1I HOUR BEFORE THE SUN BY A SIMILAR COMPARISON FOR WINTER THE REGION WOULD THEN APPEAR TO BE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE SUN  IN REFERENEE TO THE POSITION IN ADVANCE OF THE SUN OF THE RESULTANT OF THOSE ACTIONS WHICH SET THE NEEDLE END WESTWARD WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE PRECEDING COLD BEING PERHAPS SEVEN HOURS ONLY TO THE WEST IS BY ITS ACTION ON THE GENERAL SYSTEM OF THE CURVES AIDING THE WESTENING OF THE NEEDLE WHILST THE SUN IS IN THE EAST AND EVEN OVER THE MERIDIAN 3005ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMCAPE OF GOOD HOPE 3032 I AM INCLINED TO REFER MUCH OF THIS PRECESSION OF THE WARM REGION AT TORONTO TO THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF LAND AND WATER THERE THE ATLANTIC IS ON THE EAST AND THE CONTINENT OF ARNERICA ON THE WEST OF THE STATION AND AS DOVES CHARTS AND RESULTS INTIMATE THE TEMPERATURE MAY RISE HIGHER AND SOONER OVER THE LAND THAN OVER THE WATER AND SO THROW THE WARMN REGION IN RESPECT OF TORONTO IN ADVANCE OF THE TIME OR OF THE SUN IN THE CASE OF HOBARTON THE ARRANGEMENT IS DIFFERENT AND IN FACT WHAT LAND THERE IS IS BETWEEN THE ADVANCING SUTN AND THE STATION AND WOULD TEND TO HOLD THE WARML AIR REGION BACK AND TEND TO CAUSE ITS TIME TO COINCIDE WITH THAT OF THE SUN EVEN THE GREATER DIFFERENCE IN SUMMER THAN IN WINTER AT TORONTO APPEARS TO BE EXPLICABLE IN THE SAME MANNER BY REFERENCE TO THE RELATIVE POSITION OF THE SUN AT THE TWO SEASONS TO THE LAND AND WATER ARRANGEMENT 3033 THLOUGH THE TEMPERATURE ON THE EARTHS SURFACE IS A VERY UNCERTAIN INDICATION OF THAT ABOVE 2937 YET AS FAR AS IT GOES IT HARMONIZES WITH THIS VIEW TLLE MAXI MUM TEMPERATURE OCCURS SOONER AFTER MIDDAY AT HOBAITON THAN AT TORONTO IN THE FORMER PLACE IT IS AT 2 OCLOCK AND VERY REGULAR AND THE MINIMUM AT 1619 OCLOCK BEING EARLIER IN SUMMNER AND LATER IN WINTER AT TORONTO THE MAXIMA ARE FIOM 2 TO 4 OCLOCK AND THE MINIMA AT 1618 OCLOCK THE MAXIMA ARE LATER IN SUMMER THAN IN WINTER THE MINIMNA ARE AS AT HOBARTON BEING LATER IN WINTER THAN IN SUMMER THE MEAN TEMPERATURE IS LOWER AT TORONTO THAN AT HOBARTON BEING AS 44048 AND 53048 THE RANGE OF VARIATION IS ALSO GREATER BEING AT TORONTO 43 AND FOR HOBARTON ONLY 18 3034 IT IS PROBABLE THAT EFFECTS OF RETARDATION AND ACCELERATION IN RESPECT OF THE PASSAGE OF THE LOCAL PART OF THE WARM REGION FOR A GIVEN PLACE MAY OCCUR IN TNANY PARTS OF THE GLOBE AND THESE WILL REQUIRE TO BE ASCERTAINED FOR EVERY LOCALITY AND FOR THE DIFFERENT SEASONS THERE A PLACE HAVING THE REVERSE POSITION OF TORONTO WOULD HAVE A REVERSED OR RETARDED EFFECT AND HENCE IT MIGHT HAPPEN THAT NEEDLES IN THE SAME LATITUDE MIGHT BE AFFECTED AT VERY DIFFERENT LOCAL TIMES AND YET ALL BE REGULARLY AFFECTED EVERY TWENTYFOUR HOURS THE REGION WOULD IN THAT TIME MAKE ITS DIURNAL REVOLUTION BUT VARY IN THE VELOCITY OF ITS DIFFERENT PARTS AT DIFFERENT PERIODS OF ITS JOURNEY AND THAT IN A DIFFERENT DEGREE AND ORDER FOR DIFFERENT LATITUDES AND FOR DIF FERENT PARTS OF THE SAME PARALLEL OF LATITUDE EVEN THE TIME DURING WHICH THE EFFECT AS FOR INSTANCE THE SUNSWING CONTINUED WOULD PROBABLY BE ALTERED ONE PLACE HOLDING THE INFLUENCE LONGER AND ANOTHER DISMISSING IT SOONER ANALOGOUS TO TWO CON DITIONS OF STABLE AND UNSTABLE EQUILIBRIUM 3035 CAPE OF GOOD HOPE THIS STATION IS IN LONGITUDE 18 33 EAST AND LATITUDE 33 56 SOUTH THE MEAN DECLINATION IS 29 WEST AND THE DIP 53 15 SOUTH THE AMOUNT OF DIP COMBINED WITH THE POSITION OF THE PLACE GIVES A MAGNETIC EQUATOR WHICH PASSES NEARLY THROUGH THE ASTRONOMICAL POLES AND SO THE SUNS PATH IN EVERY PART OF THE YEAR INTERSECTS IT ALMOST AT RIGHT ANGLES AND AT THE SAME HOUR NAMELY ABOUT 20 PAST 7 OCLOCK IN THE MORINING AND EVENING OR AT 1911 20 AND 7H 20 BUT  SEE TABLES PP 117 118 AND CURVES OF VARIATION PLATE II 105 MDCCCLI P106 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII BECAUSE OF THE GREAT DECLINATION THE SUN IS IN THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN TWO HOURS BEFORE HE ARRIVES AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IN CAPE WINTER AND HALF AN HOUR OR MORE BEFORE IN CAPE SUMMER 3036 THE SUN PASSES OBLIQUELY THROUGH BOTH THE CHIEF QUADRANTS AND ACROSS THEIR CENTRAL PARTS PRETTY EQUABLY BUT BECAUSE OF THE WESTERN CHARACTER OF THE MEAN DE CLINATION HE IS MUCH NEARER THE CAPE WHEN IN THE EASTERN THAN WHEN IN THLE WESTERN QUADRANT FOR ALL THE MONTHS AND SO THE COMING UP EFFECT I E THE WESTENING BEFORE THE MIDDAY SWING COMMENCES OUGHT TO BE MORE POWERFUL THAN THE EASTENING AFTER IT IS OVER AND SUCH IS THE CASE THIS IS IN BEAUTIFUL AND STRIKING CONTRAST TO GREEN WICH WHICH HAVING THE SAME KIND OF MEAN DECLINATION AND NEARLY IN THE SAME DE GREE IS ON THE NORTH OF THE SUNS PATH AND THEREFORE THE LUMINARY PASSES ITS MAG NETIC MERIDIAN BEFORE 12 OCLOCK AND FOR A TIME STILL APPROACHES THE STATION THE RE SULT IS THE REVERSE EFFECT TO WHAT WE HAVE AT THE CAPE FOR THE EASTENING EFFECT AT THE END OF THE MIDDAY SWING IS MORE POWERFUL THAN THE WESTENING EFFECT BEFORE IT AS IS WELL SEEN BY THE CURVES GIVEN IN PLATE II 3037 SELECTING JULY AS THE MONTH IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF WINTER OCCURS AT THE CAPE WE FIND THAT THE DAYSWING IS VERY FEEBLE AS IT OUGHT TO BE THE SUN BEING IN THE NORTHERN TROPIC AND FAR AWAY AND THE SWING EAST IS AT AN END BY 3 OCLOCK WHEN THE SUN HAS PASSED BY ABOUT ONE HOUR OVER THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN THE UPPER OR NORTH END OF THE NEEDLE THEN WESTENS FOR TWO HOURS FOLLOWING THE SUN UNTIL 5H WHEN THE LUMINARY IS LOW TO THE CAPE AND AT ITS SETTING AFTER THAT THE NEEDLE END EASTENS SLOWLY UNTIL 10H THEN A LITTLE MORE QUICKLY UNTIL MIDNIGHT PASSING THE MEAN POSITION AT 1 11H QUICKER STILL UNTIL 16H OR 17H AND STILL MORE QUICKLY UNTIL 19H WHEN IT HAS ATTAINED ITS MAXIMUM EAST POSITION THIS EFFECT I BELIEVE TO BE DUE TO THE COLD WHICH IN THESE HOURS IS APPROACHING FROM THE EAST AND SETTING BY ITS PARAMAGNETIC ACTION 3003 THE NEEDLE END EASTWARD ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH THE MAXIMUM COLD IN THIS MONTH IS AT 1711 OR 18 AND AS FAR AS IT GOES THIS RESULT ACCORDS WITH THE EFFECT ABOVE DESCRIBED AT 1 91 THE SUN IN RISING NOT ONLY STOPS THE EASTENING BUT QUICKLY DRIVES THE NEEDLE BACK AGAIN AND THE LATTER VERY RAPIDLY GOES WESTWARD UNTIL ABOUT 23H AT WHICH TIME THE SUNSWING FROM WEST TO EAST COMES ON BEING OVER BY 2H OIR 3H COMN PLETING THE DAILY VARIATION AFTER WHICH THE NEEDLE GOES WEST FOLLOWING THE SUN AS BE FORE IN THIS SUNSWING IS SEEN THE EFFECT OF AN INCLINED MAGNETIC MERIDIAN 3000 FOR THOUGH THE SUN IS AT THE BEGINNING ONLY AN HOUR EAST OF THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN HE IS FULL THREE HOURS TO THE EAST OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AS THE SWING OCCUPIES ABOUT FOUR HOURS THE WARM REGION IS PROBABLY NEAR THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN ABOUT HALFPAST 12 OR 1 OCLOCK 3038 JANUARY PRESENTS A CASE OF CAPE SUMMER THE DAYSWING IS THEN FROM 21H TO I1I OR 2H AFTER 2H THE NEEDLE UPPER END FOLLOWS THE SUN WESTWARD UNTIL 611 AND THEN MOVES A LITTLE EASTWARD FOR TWO HOURS AFTER THIS IT MOVES SLOWLY WESTWARD AGAIN THE WHOLE EFFECT BEING AS IF A COLD REGION HAD OCCURRED ON THE EAST HAD PASSED OVER AND GONE AWAY WEST AND THE TERNPERATURE BELOW AT THIS TIME IS WITHIN 2 OF THEATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMCAPE OF GOOD HOPE MINIMUM THIS NIGHT EFFECT OF DRAWING THE NEEDLE WESTWARD 3004 PROCEEDS SLOWLY UNTIL 15H OR 16H BEING ASSISTED BY THE RISING TEMPERATURE ON THE EAST URGING THE END STILL MORE RAPIDLY WEST UNTIL 201 WHEN HAVING REACHED ITS MAXIMUM IN THAT DIRECTION IT AT 2111 TURNS BACK AND IS DRIVEN TO EXTREME EAST IN THE SUNSWING THROUGH AN AMOUNT OF VARIATION MORE THAN TWICE AS GEAT AS THAT PRODUCED IN JULY OR CAPE WINTER 3039 I THINK THE ABOVE IS A TRUE EXPLANATION OF THE REVERSE MOTION OF THE NEEDLE IN THE MONTHS OF JULY AND JANUARY OR CAPE WINTER AND SUMMER IN WINTER THE PARA MAGNETIC EFFECT OF COLD AIR IS ON BETWEEN 121 AND 19H REMAINING LONGER ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AS IT PASSES FORWARD BOTH IT AND THE SUN REGION CONSPIRE AT 19H TO CARRY THE NEEDLE WESTWARD FOR THOUGH THEY HAVE OPPOSITE ACTIONS THEY ARE THEN ALSO ON OPPOSITE SIDES OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN 3005 IN THE SUMMER THE COLD REGION HAS MUCH LESS POWER OCCULRS EARLIER SOON PASSES OVER FOR THE SUMMER SUN IS BEHIND IT AND THEN RATHER AIDS THE SUN IN CARRYING THE NEEDLE WESTWARD 3040 SOME OF THE OTHER MONTHS ARE STILL MORE STRIKING IN SUMMER EFFECT FEBRUARY HAS A SWING THROUGH 8 FROM WEST TO EAST BETWEEN 21H AND 1H THEN FROM LH TO 3H IT SCARCELY CHANGES FROM 3H TO 6H IT FOLLOWS THE SUN WEST FROM 6H TO 1611 IT VARIES BUT LITTLE SHOWING THE MEREST TRACE OF EAST EFFECT ABOUT 811 AND AFTER 1611 IT PASSES WEST MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY SO THAT BY 21H IT IS AT A MAXIMUM WEST READY TO SWING BACK AS THE SUN EGION N PASSES OVER THE OTHER AND INTERMEDIATE MONT AON AE EASILY TRACED AND FOUND TO BE BEAUTIFULLY CONSISTENT WITH THE SAME PRINCIPLES OF THE HYPOTHESIS AS IS EVIDENT IN ALMOST EVERY CASE EACH MONTH PARTAKES OF THE CHARACTER OF THE PRECEDING MONTH IN SOME DEGREE THOUGH NOT SO MUCH IN THIS CASE OF THE CAPE AS IN SOME OTHERS 3053 THE CURVES OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY ARE MORE EQUAL 3041 THE TIME OF THE SUNSWING ILLUSTRATES EXCEEDINGLY WELL THE EFFECT OF THE INCLINED MAGNETIC MERIDIAN 3000 IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER AND JANUARY THE SWING IS FROM 20H TO BETWEEN H AND 2H IN SE THESE ONTHS THE SUN CROSSES THE ASTRONOMICAL NERIDIAN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR BEFORE HE ARRIVES AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IN OCTOBER FEBRUARY AND MARCH THE SWING IS LATER BEING FROM 21H TO 2H OR 3H FOR THE SUN THEN PASSES THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AN HOUR OR NORE LATER THAN THE ASTRONOMICAL OR TIME MERIDIAN IN SEPTEMBER APRIL AND MAY THE SWING IS STILL LATER BEING FIOM 22H TO 2H OR 3H AND THE SUN IS STILL LONGER THAN BEFORE IN REACHING THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IN JUNE JULY AND AUGUST THE SWING IS LATEST BEING FROM 2311 TO 3H AND THE SUN IS PROPORTIONATELY LATE IN ARRIVING AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN WHAT I DESCRIBE AS THE PASSAGE OF THE SUN IS OF COURSE TRUE OF THE WARM REGION WHICH PRECEDES IT BUT I PIEFER REFERRING TO THE VISIBLE TYPE RATHER THAN TO THE INVISIBLE REALITY BECAUSE IT TIES THE CONSIDEIATIONS OF TIME MORE SIMPLY TOGETHER 3042 THE INCLINATION AT THE CAPE VARIES SINGULARLY IN THE TWENTYFOUR HOURS DE PENDING I THINK UPON ITS MEAN DEGREE IT IS SUCH THAT THE WARM AND COLD RESULT ANTS OF ACTION FOR THE CAPE WILL SOMETIMES BE ABOVE THE LINE OF THE DIP AND SOMETIMES  THE MINIMUM TEMPERATURE BELOW IS THREE HOURS EARLIER 2 107108 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII BELOW IT NOT ONLY FOR DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE YEAR BUT I THINK IN SOME SEASONS EVEN AT DIFFERENT TIMES OF THE DAY IT WOULD REQUIRE MUCH ATTENTION TO UNRAVEL THE WHOLE EFFECT IN JUNE JULY AND AUGUST WHEN THE SUN AND ITS WARM REGION ARE GREATLY TO THE NORTH OF THE CAPE IT APPEARS THAT THE DIP IS INCREASED AS THE REGION PASSES WHICH WOULD GIVE A ROTATION OF THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE LIKE THAT AT HOBARTON 2909 BUT IN NOVEMLBER DECEMBER JANUARY FEBRUARY MARCH AND APRIL THE DIP DITNINISHES AT THAT TIME AND THLE RESULTING ROTATION OF THE POLE IS OF THE CONTRARY KIND OR LIKE THAT AT ST HELENA 3057 AND SINGAPORE 3061 3067 3043 THE DAILY VARIATIONS OF INTENSITY AT THE CAPE ARE REMARKABLE IN THE MONTHS OCTOBER TO APRIL IT IS AT A CHIEF MAXIMUM AT 19 O0I 20H BY NOON IT IS REDUCED TO A MINIMUM AS THE SUN PASSES OVER GRADUALLY RISES TO A SECOND MAXIMUM ABOUT 4H OR 5H AND THEN AFTER SINKING A LITTLE ABOUT 81 OR 9H REACHES THE CHIEF MAXIMUM ABOUT 18H OR 19H NEXT MORNING IN THE MONTHS FROM MAY TO SEPTEMBER THE CHIEF MAXIMUM IS AT 21H OR 22H WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY A MINIMUM AT 1H OR 2 DUE TO THE DAY EFFECT THEN COMES ON THE 5H MAXIMUMN AND AFTER THIRTEEN HOURS OR MORE THE SECOND MINI MUM AS LOW ALMOST AS THE FORNIER AND ONLY THREE HOURS BEFORE THE CHIEF MAXIMUMRN SO THAT THIS MAXIMUM IS PLACED BETWEEN MINIMA CLOSE ON EACH SIDE OF IT 3044 THESE ARE EXACTLY THE MONTHS DURING WHICH THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE MNOVES EASTWARD IN EARLY MORNING UP TO 19H AND THAT IS JUST THE HOUR WHEN THE MINI MUM INTENSITY OCCURS FROM 18H OR 19 TO 21H THE INTENSITY RISES TO A MAXIMUM PRECISELY AS THE LINES OF FORCE ARE MOVING WESTWARD BEFORE THE SUN REGION PRIOR TO THEIR QUICK RETURN EAST AND AS THEY RETURN IN THEIR QUICK JOURNEY SO THE INTENSITY FALLS TO A MINIMUM AGAIN AND IS AT THAT MINIMUM AT 1H OR 2H JUST AS THE SWING IS OVER HERE IS A VERY CLOSE CONNEXION AND IT IS CURIOUS TO SEE THE NEEDLE END AT EAST WITH MINIMUM POWER AT 18H ANTD AGAIN ALSO AT I1H REMEMNBERING THAT IN THAT TIME IT HAS SWUNG FROM EAST TO WEST AND BACK TO EAST AGAIN 3045 ST LIELENATHIS IS A STATION WHICH COLONEL SABINE HAS DISTINGUISHED AS OF THE HIGHEST INTEREST BEING NEAR THE LINE OF LEAST FORCE WITHIN THE TROPICS AND WITH LITTLE MAGNETIC INCLINATIONT IT WAS HERE ALSO THAT HE CALLED ATTENTION TO THE STRIKING FACT THAT THE COURSE OF THE NEEDLE IS IN SOME MONTHS IN ONE DIRECTION AND IN OTHER MONTHS IN THE CONTRARY FOR THE SAME HOURS OF THE DAY DE LA RIVE ATTEMPTED TO EXPLAIN THIS FACT BUT SABINE HAS STATED THAT THIS EXPLANATION IS NOT SATISFACTORY 3046 ST HELENA BEING A SMALL ISLAND IN THE SOUTH ATLANTIC OCEAN IS REMOVED ABOUT 1200 MILES FROM THE NEAREST LAND THE LONGITUDE IS 5 40 WEST THE LATITUDE 15 56 SOUTH  THE MEAN DECLINATION 23 30 WEST AND THE MEAN DIP 220 SOUTH HENCE THERE ARE THREE QUADRANTS CONCERNED IN THE DAY ACTION OF THE SUN ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT LUMINARY IS SOUTH OF THE EQUATOR THE SUN IS SOUTH OF ST HELENA ITSELF IN THE MONTHS  SEE TABLES PP 119 120 AND CURVES OF VARIATION PLATE II T MAGNETICAL OBSERVATIONS ST

OF NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY OR FOR NEARLY THAT TIME IT IS NORTH OF THE ISLAND FOR THE REST OF THE YEAR AT ONE TIME THE SUN PASSES THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN BEFORE IT ARRIVES AT THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND AT ANOTHER TIME THE CON TRARY IS THE CASE IN ADDITION TO THESE PECULIAR CIRCUMSTANCES ST HELENA IS A PLACE OF GREAT LOCAL DIFFERENCES AND ALSO ITS DIP IS SO LOW THAT THE SUNS DAY EFFECT IS ALMOST CONSTANTLY TO DEPRESS AND LESSEN IT 3047 IN JUNE AND JULY THE SUN RISES TO ST HELENA IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER IT PASSES INTO THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND CROSSES IT TOWARDS THE SOUTHE RN END BEING THEN AT MIDDISTANCE IN THE QUADRANT ABOUT ONETHIID OF THE LENGTH OR NEARLY 60 FIOM THE SOUTHERN TERMINATION IT LEAVES THIS QUADRANT ABOUT IH 20M CROSSING THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AT THAT TIME AND CONSEQUENTLY SO LONG AFTER PASSING THE ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN AND ENTERING THE THIRD OR NORTHWEST QUADRANT TRAVERSES IT OBLIQUELY TOWARDS ITS NORTHERN EXTREMITY IN OUR WINTER DECEMBER AND JANUARY THE SUN ALSO RISES TO ST HELENA IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT AS BEFORE BUT IT NOW REMAINS IN IT UNTIL 22H BEING FOR MUCH OF THE TIME IN STRONG PLACES OF ACTION IT ENTERS THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT TO THE SOUTH OF ST HELENA AND DOES NOT REMAIN IN IT TWO HOURS BEING THEN ONLY IN THE WEAKEST PART OF IT IT LEAVES IT AGAIN BEFORE ARRIVING AT THE ASTRONORNICAL MERIDIAN THEN ENTERS THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT GLIDING ALONG NEAR TO ITS SOUTHERN SIDE AND IS WITHIN TWOTHIRDS OF AN HOUI OF LEAVING IT WHEN IT SETS TO ST HELENA 3048 AS JUNE PRESENTS THE ASPECT OF CIRCUMSTANCES APPROACHING NEAREST TO THAT OF A STATION FURTHER SOUTH AS HOBARTON OR THE CAPE SO I WILL CONSIDER THE VARIATIONS FOR IT FIRST THE NOLTH OR UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS THEN NEARLY AT ITS MEAN PLACE AT MIDNIGHT OR 12H IT ADVANCES EAST SLOWLY AT FIRST UNTIL 16H AND THEN MORE AND MORE RAPIDLY UP TO 19H WHEN IT STOPS AND GOES AS QUICKLY WEST UNTIL ABOUT 22H AFTER WHICH IT CHANGES BUT LITTLE UNTIL 3H1 WHEN IT MOVES WEST TILL 5H AND THEN SLOWLY EAST UP TO 12H AND THEN ONWARDS TO 16H AND 19H AS ALREADY SAID THE EASTENING FROM MIDNIGHT AND BEFORE I REFER TO THE PATRAMAGNETIC ACTION OF THTE COLD WHICH COMTES UP FROM THE EAST AS BEFORE 3003 3025 3037 THE RAPID INCREASE OF THE EASTENING FROM 16H TO I H IS CONSISTENT WITHL THE INCREASING COLD OF THE EARLY MORINING AND ALSO WITH THE CIT CUMSTANCE THAT THE SUN AND ITS REPRESENTATIVE REGION ARE THEN PASSING FRTOM THE SOUTH EAST INTO THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT AND MUST BE NOT FAR FROMN THE NEUTRAL LINE FOR THLAT IS THE TIME OF QUICKEST TRANSIT OF THE NEEDLE AS THE SUN ADVANCES INTO THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT IT FIRST STOPS THE EASTENING AS AT 19H AND THEN CONVERTS IT INTO WESTENING 3014 WHICH GOES ON CONSISTENTLY WITH ALL FORMER OBSERVATIONS UNTIL 22H THE NEEDLE IS THEN RETAINED A LITTLE WEST OF ITS MEAN POSITION UNTIL 1H AT WHICHT TIME IT HAS NOT YET ATTAINED COINCIDENCE WITH THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AND AFTER TILLS HOUR IT IS DETER MINED EAST A LITTLE UNTIL 3H THIS EFFECT FIROM 22H TO 3H I CONSIDER AS THE SUNSWING TO THE EAST AND I THINKL EXAMINING THE GLOBE 2996 ITS SMALL AMOUNT IN DECLINATION IS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH THE RELATIVE POSITIONS OF ST HELENA AND THE WARM REGION COMBINED WITH THOSE OF THE ACTIVE AND NEUTRAL PARTS OF THE QUADRANTS TRAVERSED DURING THE TIME FROM 3H TO 5H THE NEEDLE END MOVES WESTWARD FOLLOWING THE SUN AND 109110 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII THAT EFFECT HARMONIZES WITH THE IDEA THAT THE PREVIOUS HOLDING OF THE NEEDLE IN AN EASTERN POSITION FIOMN 22H TO 3H IS THE SUN EFFECT THEN THE SLOW EASTENING FRIOM 5 TO MIDNIGHT AND BEYOND IS THE COLD EFFECT COMLING ON 3049 COLONEL SABINE HAS SHOWN THAT THE MONTHS OF MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST MAY BE CLASSED TOGETHER SO THAT I WILL NOT SPEAK OF EACH WHILST THEY SHOW THE ANALOGIES THEY HAVE BETWEEN THEMSELVES THEY ALSO INDICATE THE TRANSITIONS TO AND FROMN THE OTHER MONTHS LET US CONSIDER SEPTEMBER FROM 7 THROUGH MIDNIGHT ON TO 16 THE NEEDLE STANDS NEARLY AT THE MEAN FROM 161 TO 18H THE UPPER OR NORTH END EASTENS THROUGH THE EFFECT OF THE EARLY MORNING COLD THAT THE EASTENING SHOULD BE FULLY EFFECTED AN HOUR SOONER THAN BEFORE 3048 IS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH THE PRIN CIPLES FOR THE PATH OF THE SUN AND ITS DIAMAGNETIC REGION IS FAR NEARER TO THE STATION THAN BEFORE BEING NOW ABOUT THE EQUATOR FROM 18H TO 22H IT SENDS THE END WEST WARD IN CONFORMITY WITH ALL FORNMER OBSERVATIONS AND THEN COMES ON THE SUNSWING FROM WEST TO EAST BETWEEN 22H AND 24H AND A HOLD AT EXTREME EAST AN HOUR LONGER THE SHORTNESS IN TIME OF THIS TRANSIT IS I THINK A BEAUTIFUL POINT THE SUN IS STILL NORTH OF ST HELENA BUT IS NOW SO MUCH NEARER THAT HE PASSES THROUGH THE SAME ANGLE EAST AND WEST IN RESPECT TO THE PLACE OF OBSERVATION IN LESS THAN HALF THE TIME OF THE FORMER SUN EFFECT IN JUNE 3041 AFTER THIS THE NEEDLE END TRAVELS WEST FROM 1H TO 6B FOLLOWING THE SUN AS ON OTHER OCCASIONS AND THEN FROM 6H TO 9H IT MOVES A LITTLE EAST BY THE EVENING COLD IN THE EAST AND REMAINS NEAR THE MEAN POSITION UNTIL THE GREATER COLD BEFORE SUNRISE 3005 3011 TAKES IT MORE EAST BETWEEN 16H AND 18H OF THE CONMING DAY 3050 IN LOOKING AT THE CURVES OF VARIATION PLATE II IT WILL BE SEEN THAT THE CURVE FOR THE NEXT MONTH OCTOBER IS REMARKABLE FOR BEING LIKE IN GENERAL CHARACTER ATND YET FAR REMOVED IN PLACE FROM THAT OF SEPTEMBER AND THIS EFFECT APPEARS DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THLAT THE SUN HAS NOW ARRIVED AT THE LATITUDE OF ST HELENA OR NEARLY SO ACCORDING TO MY SUPPOSITION THERE HAS BEEN A FEEBLE NIGHT EFFECT 3010 AND AT MIDNIGHT THE NEEDLE IS AT THE MEAN POSITION AND MOVING SLOWLY WESTWARD WHEN THE GREATER COLD WHICH PRECEDES THE SUNRISE COM0ING INTO ACTION ON THE EAST COUNTERBALANCES AND ARRESTS THE WESTERN PROGRESS AND EVEN DRAWS THE NEEDLE AS BEFORE EAST A LITTLE FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS TILL 18 EVEN THE SUN REGION IS AT 16 IN THAT QUADRANT THE SOUTH EAST ONE THAT IF IT COULD ACT ON THE NEEDLE IT WOULD COMBINE WITH THE COLD IN THE NEXT OR NORTHEAST QUADRANT IN SETTING IT EASTWARD BY 18H BOTH THE PRECEDING COLD REGION AND THE FOLLOWING SUN REGION ARE SO FAR ADVANCED IN THEIR RESPECTIVE QUA DRANITS THAT THEY COMBINE TO CARRY THIE NEEDLE END WEST AS BEFORE UNTIL 20H AND THEN COMES ON THE SWING FROM WEST TO EAST UNTIL 24H WHY THIS BEGINS SOONER LASTS LONGER AND IS ABOVE FOUR TIMES THE EXTENT OF THE SEPTEMNBER SWING APPEARS TO BE THAT THE SUTN REGION COMES UP UPON THE LATITUDE OF ST HELENA AND SO ACTS IN RESPECT OF THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN MNORE POWERFULLY AND ALSO SOONER AND LONGER ALSO THAT BECAUSE OF THE MIEAN DECLINATION WEST IT ARRIVES AT EQUIDISTANT POINTS FROM AND PASSES OVER THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN SOONER AND ALSO FROM THE EFFECT OF AN ACCUMULATIVE ACTION ADDED TO IT FROM FORMER MONTHS 3053ATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMST HELENACUMULATIVE EFFECTS IIL 3051 AT 1 OCLOCK THE NEEDLE BEGINS TO TURN FROM EXTREME EAST I E SOONER THAN IN THE FORMER MONTHS BECAUSE THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN IS SOONER PASSED AND FOLLOWS THE SUN UNTIL 4H WHEN IT STOPS AND THEN THE EVENING OR NIGHT ACTION DUE TO COLD AP PEARING IN THE EAST CARRIES THE NEEDLE BACK EASTWARD TILL 10H AND THEN AS IT AD VANCES IN THE QUADRANT LETS THE NEEDLE RETURN BACK AGAIN 3004 UNTIL BETWEEN 12H AND 13H WHEN THE LATTER IS IN ITS MEAN POSITION THE COLD REGION THEN APPEARS TO DRAW IT WESTWARD UNTIL 1 6H WHEN ITS DISTANCE INCREASING IT RELEASES THE NEEDLE AND LETS IT RETURN EAST UNTIL 18 OCLOCK WHEN THE LATTER IS STILL WEST OF ITS NORMAL POSI TION AND THEN THE SUN REGION RISING UP HELPED PERHAPS BY THE COLD THAT IRNMEDIATELY PRECEDES IT WHICH IS PROBABLY NOW OVER OR BEYOND THE MLAGNETIC MERIDIAN SETS IT TOWARD THE WEST PRIOR TO THE SUNSWING 3052 IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY THE SUN IS SOUTH OF THE STATION THIS MAKES NO DIFFERENCE IN THE GENERAL CLARACTER OF THE CURVE FOR THESE MONTHS NOR SHOULD IT ACCORD ING TO THE HYPOTHESIS EXCEPT IN THIS POINT THAT THOUGH THE SUN IS VERY NEAR TO ST HE LENA AND HAS THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF THE PRECEDING MONTHS 3050 3053 ADDED TO ITS OWN EFFECT AT THE TIME STILL IT IS IN WEAKER PARTS OF THE QUADRANT AND WHILST IN THE CHLIEF SEGMENT IS ALMOST UP IN THE CORNER AND NEAR THE PLACE WHERE THE TWO NEUTRAL PLANES CROSS EACH OTHER HENCE ITS EFFECT OUGHT TO BE LESS AND SO IT IS FOR THE SUN SWING OF NOVEMBER AND FEBRUARY IS LARGER THLAN THAT OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY THE SUNSWING HAPPENS IN DECEMBER AT THE SAME TIME AS FOR OCTOBER THOUGH IN THE LATTER MONTLH IT CROSSES THE MAGNETIC MERIDIAN AFTER AND IN THE PRESENT BEFORE MID DAYR STILL THERE IS ONLY HALF AN HOURS DIFFERENCE FROM ONE TO THE OTHE AND THE OB SERVATIONS ARE PERHAPS NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO ALLOW ONE TO SEPARATE ITS PECULIAR EFFECT OUT OF AN INTERVAL OF FOUR HOURS BESIDES ACCUMULATIVE CAUSES MAY INTERFERE THE PLACES OF THE DECEMBER CURVE ARE ALTOGETHER A LITTLE MORE WEST THAN THOSE FOR OC TOBER 3053 THE CUMULAT4IVE EFFECT OF PRECEDING MONTHS IS VERY IMPORTANT AND WELLSHOWN AT ST 1ELENA 3050 THUS TAKING THE SEPTEMBER CURVE AND COMPARING IT WITH THAT FOR OCTOBER OR THE FOLLOWING MONTH WE HAVE A GREAT DIFFERENCE OF A CERTAIN KIND THEN AGAIN COMPARING SEPTEMBER WITH THE MONTH IN WHICH THE SUN IS RETURNING FRIOM THE SOUTHERN TROPIC INSTEAD OF PROCEEDING TO IT AND HAS ATRIVED AT THE SAME POSITION AS IT HAD IN OCTOBER ANOTHER STRIKING DIFFERENCE APPEARS MARCH IS THE NEAREST MONTH FOR THE SECOND COMPARISON UP TO 20H ITS CURVE CHANGES LIKE THE OCTO BER CURVE BUT THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE IS ALL THE TIME ABOUT HALF A MINUTE EAST OF ITS PLACE IN OCTOBER AT 20H THE NEEDLE IN OCTOBER BEGINS TO SWING FROM WEST AND REACHES EXTREME EAST AT 241 IN MARCH IT WESTENS UNTIL 21H THEN RETURNS AND REACHES EXTREME EAST AT 1H SO THAT THE SWING IS AN LHOUR LATER AND DURING THAT TIME THE END IS FROM HALF A MINUTE OF SPACE TO A MINUTE MORE WEST THAN IN OCTOBER THIS DIFFER ENCE I BELIEVE TO BE DUE TO THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE MONTHS BETWEEN OCTOBER AND MARCH DURING WLHICH TIME THE HEAT HAS BEEN DIMINISHING IN THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE AND INCREASING IN THE SOUTH SIMNILAR RESULTS IN OTHER MONTHS MAKE IT PROBABLE THAT112 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII THE EFFECT OF THE ATNOSPHERE THOUGH INDUCED BY THE SUN LAGS BEHIND THE LUMINARY CONSIDERED AS IN HIS ASTRONOMICAL POSITION ALL THE YEAR ROUND AND THAT THEREFORE IN ADVANCING TO AND RECEDING FIOM A TROPIC HE SEENS TO DO LESS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE AND MORE IN THE SECOND THAN IS DUE TO HIS PLACE FOR THE TIME 3054 BUT WHERE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE APPARENTLY EQUAL A DIFFERENCE ALSO ARISES THUS FROM MARCH TO APRIL IN ONE DILECTION AND FROM SEPTEMBER TO OCTOBER IN THE OTHER MIGHT BE EXPECTED TO BE ALIKE EXCEPT FOR A LITTLE OF THE LAGGING EFFECT 3053 WHICH WOULD APPEAR ON BOTH SIDES NEVERTHELESS MARCH AND APRIL ARE IN SABINES CURVES BETWEEN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER AND NEAR TOGETHEIR WHILST THE OTHER TWO ARE FAR APART THIS EFFECT I REFER TO THE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES AS REGARDS HEAT DOVE FROM SEPTEMBER TO OCTOBER THE SUN IS PASSING FROM A HEMISPHERE HAVING A MEAN TEMPERATURE IN SUMMER 174 ABOVE THAT OF THE OTHER HEMISPHERE FOR ITS WINTER LUT IN MARCH AND APRIL IT IS DEPARTING FROM A HEMISPHERE HAVING A MEAN SUMMER TEMPERATURE OF ONLY 107 ABOVE THAT OF THE OTHER HEMISPHERE FOR ITS WINTER 2949 AND THESE RESPECTIVE DIFFERENCES IMUST TEND TO SEPARATE SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER AND BRING TOGETHER MARCH AND APRIL AS IS SEEN TO BE THE CASE BY THE CURVE CHARTS PLATE II 3055 I NEED NOT GO FURTHLER INTO THE DECLINATION VARIATION OF ST HELENA THE LINES FOR THE OTHER MONTHS ARE SUBJECT TO THE OBSERVATIONS ALREADY MADE COLONEL SABINES IMPORTANT QUERY OF THE CAUSE OF DIFFERENCE IN DIRECTION FOR DIFFERENT MONTHS 3045 APPEARS TO ME AT PRESENT TO BE ANSWERED FOR THIS STATION AS WELL AS FOR THE OTHER STATIONS IN VERY VARIOUS LATITUDES WHERE IT MAKES ITS APPEARANCE 3016 3022 3039 3056 THE DIP AT ST HELENA IS A DAILY VARIATION VERY SIMPLE IN CHARACTER BEING A MAXIMUM AT 7H AND A MINIMUM AT 22H AND 23H WITH ONLY ONE PROGRESSION IT PRO CEEDS TO ITS MINIMUM THEREFORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SUNSWING I E THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE PROCEEDS TO WEST AND DESCENDS FROM 16H TO 19H OR 20H DURING WHICH TIME THEREFORE THE DIP IS DECREASING THEN IT RETURNS EAST UNTIL IT REACHES THE NEUTRAL POSI TION THE DIP DECREASING THE WHILE STILL MORE THE NEEDLE STILL CONTINUES TO GO EAST TO COMPLETE THE SUNSWING BUT NOW THE DIP INCREASES AT 24H OR 1H THE NEEDLE RETURNS IN DECLINATION AFTER THE SUN WESTWARD BUT STILL WITH INCREASING DIP AT 5H OR 6H THE WESTENING HAS ALMOST CEASED AND AN HOUR AFTER THE DIP IS AT ITS MAXIMUM 3057 SO AS THE SUN AND ITS REGION PASS OVER THEY DIMINISH THTE DIP BY DEPRESSING TTLHE UPPER ENDS OF THE LINES OF FORCE AND AS THEY PASS AWAY THE LINES RISE 2926 2937 AND THE DIP INCREASES THE ELLIPSE OR CURVE THEREFORE WHICH REPRESENTS THE MOTION OF THE UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE AT ST HELENA AS THTE SUN COMES UP FROM THE EAST IS ABOVE WESTWARD AND DOWNWARD AND BACK BELOW TO EAST THEN RISING TO BE REPEATED IN THE NEXT TWENTYFOUR HOURS THIS IS THE REVERSE DIRECTION TO THE REPRESENTATIVE ELLIPSE FOR HOBARTON HAVING LIKE SOUTH DIP IN A GREATER DEGREE BUT THAT IS IN PERFECT CONSIST ENCY WITH THE HYPOTHESIS FOR AS THE REGION IS LOCATED ABOVE IN THE AIR IT IS ABOVE THE ANGLE WHICH THE DIP MAKES WITH THE HORIZON AT ST HELENA AND THEREFORE OUGHT TO DEPRESS THE LINE OF FORCE AND LESSEN THE DIP AT HOBARTON THE REGION BEING IN THE TROPICAL PARTS IS WITHIN THE ANGLE FORMED BY THE LINE OF DIP WITH THE HORIZON ANDATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMSINGAPORE THEREFORE DEFLECTS THE LINES OF FORCE UPWARDS AND INCREASES THE DIP AND SO THE PORTIONS OF ELLIPSE AT THE TWO PLACES WHICH CORRESPOND IN TIME AND DIRECTION AS TO DECLINATION HAVE CONTRARY VARIATIONS OF INCLINATION 3058 SINGAPORETHIS IS A VERY INTERESTING STATION BEING IN LONGITUDE 1030 53 E IT HAS ONLY 1 16 N LATITUDE AND SO IS CLOSE TO THE EQUATOR ITS DECLINATION TOO IS ONLY 1 40 E AND ITS INCLINATION 12 S IT IS ALSO NEAR THE LINE OF WEAKEST FORCE ROUND THE EARTH THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR OF THE NEEDLE IS ALMOST PARALLEL TO THE EARTHS EQUATOR AND THE QUADRANTS 2929 ARE DISTRIBUTED WITH GREAT SIMPLICITY THE MAGNETIC AND ASTRONOMICAL MERIDIAN NEARLY COINCIDING IN OUR SUMMER THE SUN PASSES THROUGH THE EAST AND WEST NORTHERN QUADRANTS DURING THE DAYTIME IN OUR WINTER THROUGH THE EAST AND WEST SOUTHERN QUADRANTS AND IN CERTAIN MONTHS THROUGH ALL FOUR QUADRANTS FOLLOWING NEARLY THE NEUTRAL LINE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR 3059 HENCE IF THE LINE OF FORCE WERE FREE I E IF IT HAD NO HOLD IN THE EARTH 2919 WE SHOULD EXPECT FROM THE HYPOTHESIS LITTLE OR NO CHANGE IN THE NEEDLE ESPECIALLY IN THE MONTHS WHEN THE SUN WAS OVER THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR BUT BECAUSE THERE IS DIP AND THE LINES OF FORCE WHICH GOVERN THE NEEDLE ARE TO THE SOUTH TIED UP IN THE EARTH 2929 WHILST THEY ARE FREE TO MOVE IN THE AIR AND SPACE TOWARD TLHE NORTH SO THERE IS VARIATION BOTH OF THE DECLINATION AND INCLINATION IN A PERFECTLY CONSISTENT MANNER AND KEEPING THIS IN MIND I THINK WE SHALL HAVE NO DIFFICULTY IN TRACING THE MONTHLY RESULTS ACCORDING TO THE HYPOTHESIS 3060 IN THE FIRST PLACE THE CURVES OF DAY VARIATION ARE SO LIKE THOSE OF ST HELENA MONTH FOR MONTH THAT THE ACCOUNT GIVEN OF THEM THERE WILL SUFFICE FOR THE PRESENT OCCASION 3048 THE SUNSWING OCCURS AT THE SAME PERIOD AND THE EFFECT DEPENDENT AS I SUPPOSE ON THE CHARACTER OF THE TWO HEMISPHERES IS PRODUCED 3054 2949 THERE ARE HOWEVER STRIKING DIFFERENCES IN THE LATTER PART OF THE SUN TURN AND ALSO IN THE NIGHT HOURS FROM 5H TO 141 THE AMOUNT OF VARIATION APPEARS SMALL BUT THIS IS CHIEFLY DUE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCE THAT THE HORIZONTAL PLANE ON WHICH WE READ IT ALMOST COIN CIDES WITH THE FREE NEEDLE AND SO THE CORRECTION BEFORE REFERRED TO 3009 NOTE NECES SARY TO GIVE THE TRUE VALUE OF THE VARIATION IS HERE VERY SMALL 3061 CONSIDERING JUNE FIRST AS AT ST HELENA THE UPPER NEEDLE END MOVES EAST AS BEFORE UNTIL 19H UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE MORNING COLD AFTER WHICH IT STOPS AND IS SUNDRIVEN WEST UNTIL 221 WHEN IT SWINGS DOWNWARDS AND BENEATH TO EAST BY 3 THEN FOLLOWS THE SUN WEST UNTIL 7H IT THEN STOPS AND RETURNS CREEPING MORE AND WIORE EAST BECAUSE OF THE COMING COLD 3065 IN JULY THE NEEDLE EASTENS A LITTLE MORE BEFORE 19H WESTENS UNTIL 23H AND THEN EASTENS UNTIL 4H THE SUNSWING IS THUS THROWN AN HOUR LATER THAN IN JUNE WHICH I BELIEVE TO BE CONNECTED WITH THE ACCUMULATION OF HEAT OVER THE LAND 3054 COMBINED WITH THE LAGGING EFFECT OF THE SUN 3053 IN AUGUST THE NEEDLE END EASTENS UNTIL 1911 MORE THAN IN JULY AND MOST OF ALL THE MONTHS IT THEN WESTENS STRONGLY BEFORE THE SUN UNTIL 23H AFTER WHICH THE SUNSWING  SEE TABLES PP 121 122 AND THE CURVES OF VARIATION PLATE II THE DATA FOR SINGAPORE ARE DEDUCED FROM THE RECENT VERY VALUABLE LABOURS OF CAPTAIN ELLIOT MDCCCLI Q 113114 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII COMES ON AND CONTINUES UNTIL 5H1 AS IF THE WARM REGION WERE BEHIND THE SUN PERHAPS EVEN 2H THE TIME OF THE SWING IS MUCH PROLONGED AND NOT UNNATURALLY AS THE PLACE IS AT THE EQUATOR AND THEREFORE UNDER THE SUN IN SEPTEMBER THE EASTENING IS LESS THE WESTENING IS LESS AND THE SUNSWING IS LESS APRIL IS LIKE SEPTEMBER EXCEPT THAT THE LATTER SHOWS THE EFFECT OF THE PREVIOUSLY WARMED HEMISPHERE 3053 3062 THEN THERE ARE FOUR MONTHS IN THE YEAR NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY WHEN THE SUN IS SOUTH OF SINGAPORE AND ALTOGETHER DURING THE DAY IN THE SOUTHERN QUADRANTS 3058 AS THE SUN COMES ON FROM 16H OR 17 THE UPPER PART OF THE LINE OF FORCE MOVES WESTWARD THE LOWER BEING FIXED IN THE EARTH UNTIL 19 OR 20 OCLOCK THE SUN IS AT THIS TIME IN THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT AND IT MIGHT BE EXPECTED PERHAPS THAT THE MOTION OF THE NORTH OR UPPER END OF THE NEEDLE SHOULD BE TO THE EAST IF THERE WERE ANY CHLANGE AT ALL BUT THERE ARE TWO OR THREE REASONS FROM THE HYPOTHESIS WHY THIS SHOULD NOT BE FOR THAT EFFECT THERE SHOULD FIRST OF ALL BE NO DIP AND IN THE NEXT PLACE IF THERE WERE NO DIP THE SUN IS SO NEARLY IN THE HNEUTRAL LINE OF THE MAGNETIC EQUATOR THAT THE DEFLECTION IF ANY WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY SMALL ON THE OTHE ER HAND THE LINES OF FORCE HAVE DIP TO THE SOUTH AND BEING THEREFORE HELD IN THE EARTH THAT TRAVELLING OF THE SUN ALONG THE NEUTRAL LINE WHICH IN ITS COINING UP WOULD HAVE SENT THE WHOLE LINE OF FORCE WEST AND SO CAUSED NO VARIATION OF DECLINATION CAN NOW ONLY SEND THE NORTHERN PARTS AS THEY RISE OUT OF THE EARTH AND ARE CARRIED ON WITH THE GENERAL SYSTEM OF LINES WEST AND SO CAUSE THAT WESTERN TRAVELLING OF THE NEEDLE WHICH DOES OCCUR BESIDES THIS THOUGH THE SUN BE SOUTH OF THAT NEUTRAL LINE AND ALSO OF SINGAPORE THERE IS REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT THE MIDDLE OR RESULTANT OF THE WARM REGION IS NORTH EVEN OF BOTH 3063 WHICH WOULD AID THE WESTENING OF THE NEEDLE JUST DE SCRIBED 3063 FOR IF WE RECALL TO MIND DOVES RESULTS THEY SHOW THAT THE NORTHERN HEMNI SPHERE AS A WHOLE IS WARMER THAN THE SOUTHERN 2949 AGAIN IF WE LOOK AT THE MERIDIAN OF SINGAPORE WE SHALL FIND THAT THERE IS FAR MORE CONTINENT ON THE NORTH OF IT TO PRODUCE A HIGHER TEMPERATURE THAN TO THE SOUTH AND EVEN BY THE LOCAL TABLES OF TEMPERATURE BELOW WE SHALL FIND THAT MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST ARE THE HOTTEST MONTHS FOR SINGAPORE AND NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY THE COLDEST ALL TENDING TO MAKE US SUPPOSE THAT THE WARM REGION OF THE ATMOSPHERE IS RELATIVELY NORTH OF THE SUNS PLACE AND PERHAPS EVEN OF SINGAPORE 3067 3064 AT 201 THE SUNSWING FIOM WEST TO EAST COMES ON AND CONTINUES UNTIL 2H AFTER WHICH THE NEEDLE MOVES WEST FOLLOWING THE SUN UNTIL 10H OR I 11 WHEN IT IS NEAR THE MEAN IT STILL GOES ON WESTENING VERY SLOWLY UNTIL 17H WHEN THE MORNING SUN ACTION TAKES IT UP AND DRIVES IT MORE QUICKLY WEST UNTIL ABOUT 20 WHEN THE SUNSWING EAST OCCURS THE CURVE IN THESE MONTHS IS VERY SIMPLE IN ITS CHARACTER THE NIGHT OR COLD EFFECT APPEARS TO BE BUT SMALL BEING INDICATED RATHER BY A HESITATION THAN BY A DISTINCT MOVEMENT EAST 3065 THE EASTERLY MOVEMENT OF THE NEEDLE END IN MAY JUNE JULY AND AUGUST AND THE WESTERLY MOVEMENT IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY AND FEBRUARY FOR THEATMOSPHERIC MAGNETISMSINGAPORE SAME HOURS UP TO 19 OCLOCK IS IN STRIKING CONTRAST AND I HAVE ATTRIBUTED THE DIFFER ENCE TO THE EFFECT OF A COLD REGION COMING ON FROM THE EAST DURING THE FORMER MONTHS 3061 WHICH IS ABSENT IN THE LATTER MONTHS IN REFERENCE TO THIS POINT WE HAVE AGAIN TO CONSIDER THAT THE WARM REGION IS ON THE NORTH OF THE EQUATOR 3063 AND THAT AS THE SUN MOVES NORTH AND SOUTH IT ALSO WILL MOVE WITH IT BUT STILL KEEPING NORTH OF IT HENCE THE TWO COLD REGIONS WHICH COME UP TO THE MERIDIAN IN HIGHER LATITUDES 3006 BEFORE THE SUN WILL NOT BE IN THE SAME RELATION TO SINGAPORE FOR THE ONE ON THE SOUTH WILL BE NEARER TO IT THAN THE ONE ON THE NORTH OR AT ALL EVENTS MORE POWERFUL SO WHEN THE SUN IS NEAR AND AT THE SOUTHERN TROPIC THE WARM REGION PROBABLY PASSES OVER SINGAPORE AT WHICH TIME THEREFORE WHILST IT IS THE NEAREST THE MOST POWERFUL AND MOST DIRECT IN POSITION THE COLD REGIONS WILL BE LEAST IN FORCE AT THE STATION AND ALSO LEAST FAVOURABLY DISPOSED BY POSITION BUT WHEN THE SUN IS AT THE NORTHERN TROPIC THEN THE POWER OF THE WARM REGION IS DIMINISHED BOTH BY DISTANCE AND DIREC TION AND THE SOUTHERN COLD REGION GROWS UP INTO IMPORTANCE BY INCREASED STRENGTH AND CLOSER VICINITY AND SO PRODUCES THE EASTENING BEFORE 19H 3066 A STRIKING DIFFERENCE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE NIGHT CURVES FROM 5H TO 14H AT ST HELENA AND SINGAPORE MAY BE OBSERVED AT THE FORMER PLACE THE NEEDLE END TENDS FIRST EAST AND THEN WEST WHILST AT THE LATTER IT MOVES FIRST WEST AND THEN EAST THE DIFFERENCE IS I BELIEVE DUE TO THE APPEARANCE OF NIGHT COLD ACTION AT ST HELENA TO A GREATER EXTENT THAN AT SINGAPORE SINGAPORE SHOWS THAT ACTION IN JUNE JULY AND AUGUST AS JUST DESCRIBED 3065 BUT ONLY IN A WEAK DEGREE AND AT A LATE HOUR AT ST HELENA WHICH IS IN LATITUDE 16 S THE COLD EFFECT SHOULD FOR THE REASONS GIVEN ABOVE 3065 APPEAR IN MORE POWER AND HENCE THE EASTENING AT 6H AND AFTER AND THAT THIS IS THE CAUSE IS INDICATED ALSO IN A DEGREE BY THE TABLES OF TEMPERATURE FOR WBHILST AT SINGAPORE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MAXIMUM AND MINIMUM IN THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS IS ONLY FROM 3 TO 4 AT ST HELENA IT IS FROM 405 TO 70 AND FOURFIFTHS OR EVEN FIVESIXTHS OF THIS DEPRESSION OCCURS BY 9 OCLOCK SO THAT FOUR OR FIVE HOURS BEFORE THAT THERE WAS IN THE EAST A COLD REGION COMING UP AND PRODUCING THE EASTENING EFFECT RECORDED IN THE CURVES 3067 THE INCLINATION VARIATION AT SINGAPORE IS BEAUTIFULLY SIMPLE AND SUCH AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM THE HYPOTHESIS THE SUN OR WARM REGION WHEN PASSING THE MERIDIAN ALWAYS BEING OVER THE LINES TO DEPRESS THEM IT IS ALIKE IN ALL THE MONTHS BEING GREATEST AT NIGHTTIME AND LEAST AT MIDDAY IT IS NEARLY THE SAME FROM 8H TO 18H THEN AS THE SUN COMES UP IT DECREASES QUICKLY UNTIL 23H OR 24H AFTER WHICH AS THE SUN PASSES AWAY IT INCREASES NEARLY AS QUICKLY UNTIL 7H OR 8H THE AMOUNT OF VARIATION IS GREATEST WHEN THE SUN IS OVER OR TO THE SOUTH OF SINGAPORE IT IS LEAST IN JUNE AND JULY WHEN HE IS NEAR THE NORTHERN TROPIC IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY WHEN HE IS NEAR THE SOUTHERN TROPIC IT IS CONSIDERABLY MORE THAN IN JUNE AND JULY WHICH AGAIN SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE WARM REGION IS CHIEFLY NORTH OF THE SUN 3063 3068 THE TOTAL FORCE VARIATION IS SIMPLE BEING A MAXIMUM FROM 9H TO 12H AND A MINIMUM AT 22H OR 23H NEAR NOON THE GREATEST VARIATION IS IN APRIL AND OCTOBER Q2 115116 DR FARADAYS EXPERIMENTAL RESEARCHES IN ELECTRICITY SERIES XXVII OR AT THE EQUINOXES AND THE LEAST IN DECETNBER AND JUNE WHEN THE SUN IS AT THE TROPICS THE FORCE IS THE LEAST TOWARDS NOON WHEN I SUPPOSE THAT THE AIR ABOVE IS IN THE WORIST CONDITION OF CONDUCTION AND WOULD CAUSE A MAGNET IN IT TO SHOW MORE POWER BUT HOW THAT MAY AFFECT THE CURVES BENEATH ON THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH WHLERE THEY ARE COMPRESSED TOGETHER IS DOUBTFUL AND THE WHOLE MATTER OF INTENSITY IS TOO UNCERTAIN AND HAS TOO MANY BEARINGS FOR ME TO CONSIDER IT USEFULLY HERE 3069 I HOPE SOON TO GIVE FURTHER EXPERIMENTAL DATA FOR

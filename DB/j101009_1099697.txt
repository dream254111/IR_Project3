LAWS OF TEXAS REGULATING PILOTAGE MR JUSTICE WHITE DELIVERED THE OPINION OF THE834 10 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER JAN COURT HOLDING FIRST THAT A STATE HAS POWER TO ENACT LAWS REGULATING PILOTAGE IN ITS OWN PORTS AND SECOND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE TEXAS STATUTES ON THAT SUB JECT WERE NOT IN CONFLICT WITH THE ACTS OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBJECT OF PILOTAGE AND WERE NOT OF SUCH A CHARACTER AS TO CAUSE THEM TO BE REPUGNANT TO THE FOLURTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OR TO THE LAWS OF CONGRESO FORBIDDING COMBINATIONS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE IN REGARD TO THE FIRST POINT THE COURT HELD THAT EVEN THOUGH STATE LAWS CON CERNING PILOTAGE ARE REGULATIONS OF COMMERCE  THEY FALL WITHIN THAT CLASS OF POWERS WHICH MAY BE EXERCISED BY THE STATES UNTIL CONGRESS HAS SEEN FIT TO ACT UPON THE SUBJECT CITING COOLEY V PORT WARDENS 12 HOW 299 13 L ED 996 EX PARTE MENIEL 13 WALL 237 20 L ED 624 WILSON V MCNAMEE 102 U S 572 26 L ED 234 THE COURT OF APPEALS OF VIRGINIA IN THE RECENT CASE OF DARDEN V THOMPSON 101 VA 635 641 9 VA LAW REG 395 WHICH HAS BEEN TAKEN BY APPEAL TO THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES CAME TO THE SAME CONCLUSION IN REGARD TO THE QUESTION WHETHER THE PROVISIONS OF THE STATUTE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS WERE VOID AS BEING IN CONFLICT WITH TWO PROVISIONS OF THE REVISED STATUTES OF THE UNITED STATES THE ONE PROVIDING  THAT NO REGULATIONS OR PRO VISIONS SHALL BE ADOPTED BY ANY STATE WHICH SHALL MAKE ANY DISCRIMINATION IN THE RATE OF PILOTAGE OR HALF PILOTAGE BETWEEN VESSELS SAILING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ONE STATE AND VESSELS SAILING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF DIFFERENT STATES OR ANY DISCRIMINA TION AGAINST VESSELS PROPELLED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY STEAM OR AGAINST NATIONAL VESSELS OF THE UNITED STATES AND ALL EXISTING REGULATIONS OR PROVISIONS MAKING ANY SUCLH DISCRIMINATION ARE ANNULLED AND ABROGATED REV STAT SEC 4237 U S COMP STAT 1901 P 2903 THE OTHER BEING THE PROVISION OF THE STATUTES REV STAT SEC 4444 U S COMP STAT 1901 P 3037 EXEMPTING COASTWISE STEAM VESSELS FROM THE OPERATION OF STATE PILOTAGE LAWS THE COURT HELD THAT ALTHOUGH THE PROVISIONS DISCRIMINATING IN FAVOR OF TEXAS SHIPS AND PORTS WERE VOID AS WAS HELD IN THE COURT BELOW BECAUSE IN CONFLICT WITH THE LAWS OF THE UNITED STATES AS THE STATE COURT HELD THAT THE DISCRIMINATING PROVISIONS WERE SEPARABLE FROM THE REST THE SAME CONSTRUCTION WOULD BE ADOPTED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES ACCORDINGLY IT WAS HELD THAT THE STATUTE AS CON STRUED WAS VALID AND THAT BY SECTION 3237 OF THE REVISED STATUTES CONGRESS DID NOT INTEND TO REVOKE THE POWER OF THE STATES ON THAT SUBJECT OR TO ABROGATE EX ISTING PILOTAGE LAWS OF THE SEVERAL STATES CONTAINING DISCRIMINATORY PROVISIONS BUT ONLY TO ABROGATE THE PROVISIONS MAKING THE DISCRIMINATION AND THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 4444 OF THE REVISED STATUTES CLEARLY CONTEMPLATED THAT BY THE EXISTING STATE LAWS COASTWISE STEAM VESSELS OF THE UDITED STATES WERE STUBJECT TO PILOTAGE CHARGES AND PROPOSED WHILE WITHDRAWING SUCH VESSELS FROM PILOTAGE CHARGES NOT IN OTHER RESPECTS TO INTERFERE WITH STATE LAWS ON THE SUBJECT OF PILOT AGE A CONSTRUCTION PLAINLY RESULTING AS THE COURT SAYS FROM THE FOLLOWING PRO VISION OF SECTION 4444 AFOREINENTIONED 1NOTHING IN THIS TITLE SHALL BE CONSIDERED TO ANNUL OR AFFECT ANY REGULATION ESTABLISHED BY THE LAWS OF ANY STATE REQUIRING VESSELS ENTERING OR LEAVING A PORT IN ANY SUCH STATE OTHER THAN COASTWISE STEAM VESSELS TO TAKE A PILOT DULY LICENSED OR AUTHORIZED BY THE LAWS OF SUCH STATE THIS CONSTRUCTION SUSTAINS THE DECISION IN DARDEN V THOMPSON 101 VA 635 REFERRED TO ABOVE IN THAT CASE A COASTWISE SAILING VESSEL DECLINED THE SERVICES OF1905 NOTES OF CASES 835 A PILOT LICENSED UNDER THE LAWS OF THIS STATE AND AS BY SEC 4444 OF THE REVISED STATUTES ONLY COASTWISE STEAM VESSELS ARE EXEMPTED FROM PILOTAGE REGULATIONS BY THE STATE AND THE COURT HOLDS ABOVE THAT THEY WERE FORMERLY SUBJECT TO SUCH REG LATIORS IT FOLLOWS THAT COASTWISE SAILING VESSELS HAVING NEVER BEEN EXEMPTED ARE STILL UNDER STATE PILOTAGE REGULATIONS THE COURT FURTHER DECIDES THAT NEITHER THE EXEMPTION OF COASTWISE STEAM VES SELS FROM PILOTAGE UNDER THE UNITED STATES LAW NOR ANY LAWFUL EXEMPTION OF COASTWISE VESSELS CREATED BY STATE LAWS CONCERNS VESSELS IN THE FOREIGN TRADE AND THEREFORE ANY SUCH EXEMPTIONS DO NOT OPERATE TO PRODUCE A DISCRIMINATION AGAINST BRITISH VESSELS ENGAGED IN FOREIGN TRADE AND IN FAVOR OF VESSELS OF THE UNITED STATES IN SUCH TRADE THE COURT HOLDS THAT THE RIGHT OF A PERSON WHO IS COMPETENT TO PERFORM PILOT AGE SERVICES TO RENDER THEM IS NOT AN INHERENT RIGHT GUARANTEED BY THE FOUR TEENTH AMENDMENT SINCE SUCH A CONTENTION DENIES THAT PILOTAGE IS SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENTAL CONTROL AND THEREFORE IS FORECLOSED BY THE ADJUDICATIONS PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO LIKEWISE THE CONTENTION THAT THE COMMISSIONED PILOTS HAVE A MONOPOLY OF THE BUSINESS AND BY COMBINATION AMONG THEMSELVES EXCLUDE ALL OTHERS FROM THE BUSINESS IS ALSO BUT A DENIAL OF THE AUTHORITY OF THE STATE TO REGULATE THE COURT SAYS IN CONCLUSION THAT IF AN ANALYSIS OF THE TEXAS LAWS JUSTIFIES THE CONCLUSION THAT THEY ARE UNWISEAND THE COURT DISCLAIMS ANY INTENTION OF IM PLYING THAT THEY ARETHE REMEDY IS IN CONGRESS AND CANNOT BE JUDICIALLY AFFORDED THE STATUTES OF VIRGINIA ON THE SUBJECT OF PILOTS AND PILOTAGE CLI 89 SECS 19551990 VA CODE ANNO ARE VERY SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE STATE OF TEXAS REFERRED TO IN THE DECISION ABOVE AND ARE NOT VOID UNLESS THEY CONTAIN DISCRIMI NATIONS BETWEEN VESSELS SAILING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF ONE STATE AND VESSELS SAILING BETWEEN THE PORTS OF DIFFERENT STATES OR DISCRIMINATIONS AGAINST VESSELS PROPELLED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY STEAM OR AGAINST NATIONAL VESSELS OF THE UNITED STATES C B

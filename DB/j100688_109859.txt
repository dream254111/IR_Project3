J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109859,ON THE ACTION OF DETACHED LEAVES OF PLANTS ABSTRACT,I207044,47 ON THE ACTION OF DETACHED LEAVES OF PLANTS BY THOMAS ANDREW KNIGHT ESQ FRS IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT HION SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART GCB PRS READ JUNE 13 1816 PHIL TRANS 1816P 289 MR KNIGHT HAVING ON A FORMER OCCASION INFERRED FROM HIS EXPE RIMENTS AND OBSERVATIONS THAT THE TRUE SAP OF TREES FROM WHICH THE LIVING PARTS ARE GENERATED OWES ITS PROPERTIES TO HAVING CIRCULATED THROUGH THE LEAVES NOW ADDUCES OTHER FACTS MORE DIRECTLY IN POINT TO SHOW THAT A FLUID SIMILAR TO THE TRUE SAP ACTUALLY DESCENDS THROUGH THE LEAFSTALKS A TRANSVERSE SECTION WAS MADE THROUGH THE BARK OF A VINE AT THE MIDDLE OF THE INSERTION OF THE LEAFSTALK BY PASSING A SLENDER KNIFE THROUGH THE STALK SO AS TO SPLIT IT FOR ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF AN INCH ABOVE ITS INSERTION ANOTHER TRANSVERSE INCISION OF THE BARK HAVING ALSO BEEN MADE NEARLY AN INCH BELOW THESE SECTIONS WERE JOINED BY LONGITUDINAL IN CISIONS AT EACH END SO THAT A PIECE OF THE BARK HALF AN INCH BROAD AND NEARLY ONE INCH LONG COULD BE DETACHED FROM THE STEM STILL RE MAINING UNITED TO THE LOWER HALF OF THE SPLIT LEAFSTALK BEING AFTER WARDS PROTECTED ON ALL SIDES FROM THE AIR BY WAXED PAPER IT WAS FOUND TO GROW IN ALL ITS DIMENSIONS AND TO HAVE THIN LAYERS OF ALBUR NUM DEPOSITED UPON ITS INTERIOR SURFACE IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT LEAVES FROM THE POTATOE WERE TAKEN AT THE PERIOD WHEN THE TUBEROUS ROOTS WERE BEGINNING TO FORM AND WERE PLANTED IN POTS UNDER THE EXPECTATION THAT THESE LEAVES EVEN ALONE MIGHT HAVE POWER TO FORM TUBERS THE EFFECT HOWEVER WAS NOT EXACTLY AS THE AUTHOR HAD ANTICIPATED BUT THE POWER WAS MANIFESTED BY THE PRODUCTION OF A CONICAL SWELLING AT THE LOWER PART MORE THAN TWO INCHES IN CIRCUMFERENCE APPARENTLY SIMILAR IN COMPOSITION TO A TUBER AND RETAINING LIFE TO THE FOLLOWING SPRING LEAVES OF MINT ALSO DETACHED IN THE SAME MANNER WERE FOUND TO THROW OUT ROOTS AND TO CONTINUE ALIVE THROUGH THE WINTER ASSUMING THE CHARACTER AND HUE OF THOSE OF EVERGREEN TREES SINCE IT HAD APPEARED FROM FORMER EXPERIMENTS THAT THE GROWTH OF IMMATURE LEAVES DEPENDS UPON MATTER AFFORDED BY THOSE ALREADY ARRIVED AT A STATE OF MATURITY MR KNIGHT CUT OFF SEVERAL SHOOTS OF A VINE AND LAYING THEM OVER BASINS OF WATER IMMERSED PORTIONS OF THE LARGER LEAVES AND HE FOUND THAT UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES THE YOUNG LEAVES CONTINUED TO GROW FOR UPWARDS OF A MONTH DURING WHICH THEY NECESSARILY DEPENDED ON THE LARGER LEAVES FOR THEIR SUPPLY OF NOU RISHMENT THE PROGRESS OF FRUIT LIKEWISE IS PROVED TO DEPEND UPON THE MA TURE LEAVES FOR IF THESE BE DESTROYED THE FRUIT CEASES TO GROW AND GAINS NOTHING IN RIPENESS OR FLAVOUR AND ACCORDINGLY THOSE TREES ALONE ARE CAPABLE OF RIPENING FRUIT DURING WINTER WHICH RETAIN THEIR LEAVES AT THAT SEASON OF WHICH THE ORANGE LEMON IVY AND HOLLY ARE FAMILIAR EXAMPLES WITH REGARD TO THE PERIOD CURING WHICH THE TRUE SAP IS ACCUMU48 LATED AS STORE FOR FUTURE GROWTH AND RETURNED FROM ITS RESERVOIRS INTO THE CIRCULATION IT MAY BE DIFFICULT CLEARLY TO DISCOVER ANYTHING CER TAIN BUT THE AUTHOR HAS NOT CEASED TO PROSECUTE HIS EXPERIMENTS ON THE VARYING DENSITY OF THE ALBURNUM AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WOOD AND ON THE PROPORTION OF MOISTURE WHICH THEY LOSE BY DRYING AND HE HOPES AT SOME FUTURE TIME TO LAY BEFORE THE SOCIETY HIS OBSERVA TIONS SHOWING HOW FAR THE DURABILITY OF THE HEART WOOD DEPENDS ON THE PERIOD AT WHICH A TREE IS FELLED ON THE MANUFACTURE OF THE SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA AT MONTE DELLA GUARDIA NEAR GENOA BY H HOLLAND MD FRS READ JUNE 13 1816 PHIL TRANS 1816 P 294 THE SITE OF THIS MANUFACTORY IS ABOUT EIGHT MILES NW OF GENOA AT ABOUT 1600 FEET ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE SEA FROM WHICH THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN IS FIVE MILES DISTANT AND ELEVATED ABOUT 2000 FEET THE ASCENT FROM SESTRI IS BY A DEEP RAVINE THE COURSE OF A TORRENT THE EASTERN SIDE OF WHICH IS COMPOSED OF SERPENTINE IN VAST MASSES LYING UNCONFORMABLY ON PRIMITIVE SCHIST AND CONTAINING TALC STEATITE AS BESTUS AND MANY SMALL VEINS OF PYRITES ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE RAVINE ARE MOUNTAINS OF MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE IN PASSING TO THE UPPER END OF THIS RAVINE THE STRATIFICATION OF THE PRIMITIVE SCHIST AP PEARS MIXED WITH CHLORITE SLATE AND OTHER MAGNESIAN MINERALS AND CONTAINING NUMEROUS VEINS OR LAYERS OF PYRITES BOTH OF COPPER AND IRON THE SUBSTANCE OF THESE ORES IS SCHISTOSE AS WELL AS THE ROCK IN WHICH THEY LIE AND THEY ARE SO INTIMATELY MIXED WITH THE SAME MAGNESIAN MINERALS AS TO FEEL UNCTUOUS TO THE TOUCH THESE TO GETHER WITH A CERTAIN PORTION OF MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE ARE THE MATE RIALS USED IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THE SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA IN AN ES TABLISHMENT ORIGINALLY SET UP FOR CONVERTING COPPER AND IRON PYRITES INTO SULPHATES OF THOSE METALS THE SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA WAS AT FIRST OBSERVED ONLY AS AN ACCI DENTAL PRODUCT BUT HAS NOW BECOME THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THE WORK FOR THIS PURPOSE THE PYRITES IS EXTRACTED FROM THE MOUNTAIN BY TUN NELS THE LARGEST OF WHICH IS ABOUT 200 FEET IN LENGTH AND FROM 10 TO 15 FEET WIDE THE ORE IS THEN BROKEN INTO SMALL PIECES ROASTED FOR ABOUT TEN DAYS AND BEING THEN COLLECTED IN HEAPS IS KEPT MOIST WITH WATER FOR SEVERAL MONTHS DURING WHICH THE SALTS ARE FORMING THE MATERIALS ARE THEN LIXIVIATED AND AFTER THE LIQUOR HAS BEEN FILTERED THROUGH SAND THE COPPER IS FIRST PRECIPITATED BY REFUSE IRON AFTER WHICH A PORTION OF LIME PREPARED FROM THE MAGNESIAN LIMESTONE OF THE ADJACENT MOUNTAIN IS ADDED IN ORDER TO PRECIPITATE THE IRON AND AT THE SAME TIME TO MAKE SOME ADDITION TO THE PRODUCT OF SULPHATE OF MAGNESIA THE CIRCUMSTANCE PARTICULARLY TO BE ATTENDED TO IN THIS PROCESS IS THE PROPORTION OF LIME EMPLOYED WHICH IN GENERAL DOES NOT EXCEED NHRTH OF THE WEIGHT OF ORE FOR IF THIS WERE ADDED IN EXCESS IT WOULD OCCASION THE PRECIPITATION OF THE MAGNESIA ALONG WITH THE METALS THE WHOLE PRODUCE OF THIS MANUFACTORY WE ARE TOLD DOES

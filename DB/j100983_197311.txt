to the construction of the Northern Pacific Railroad was the densely wooded Cascade Range of mountains which extends through Oregon and Washington a hundred and fifty miles from the Pacific shore Prior to I854 these wilds were but little known to white men their rugged character and the heavy forest growth which covers them forbidding the use of saddle animals and making their exploration a difficult and dangerous undertaking In that year however efforts were made to find a railway route across them by the then Capt Geo B McClellan under orders from the War Department Isaac I Stevens the Governor of Washington Territory having general oversight of the expedition whose results are detailed in the Department Reports of i854 and i855 Nothing more was done worthy of mention until I867 The Northern Pacific then began explorations and surveys under its charter authorizing the construction of a line from Lake Superior to Puget Sound north of the 45th parallel and with a branch to Portland Oregon via the Columbia River from a point not more than three hundred miles from the coast These expeditions occurring at intervals during thirteen years had varying success the engineering parties being often forced through severe weather and failing supplies to return to head quarters with but meagre information Nevertheless much was learned of the general character of the mountains and their possibilities enough to convince the company that the difficulties of construction would be great and that no selec tion of a route should be made until every part of the range had been explored These facts diverted attention for a time to the Columbia 239240 Stampede Pass Cascade Range Washington River branch as the more promising immediate undertaking Matters drifted along however until i88o when the success of the Company in raising funds to push construction west of Bismarck the terminus since 73 made it imperative that the route be definitely located By this time the Oregon Railway and Naviga tion Co had commenced building from Portland along the Columbia River having in view two objects one to reach the wheat fields of Eastern Oregon and Washington and the other the construction of a line that might become the Pacific Coast outlet and connec tion for both the Northern Pacific and Union Pacific the latter company having begun the construction of its Oregon Short Line with the purpose of extending it through to the coast The Northern Pacific finding its route for the Columbia River branch thus occupied was forced to decide upon a line across the Cascade Mountains to Puget Sound With this in view further explorations of the range between Mt Adams and Snoqualmie Pass were begun under the direction of Col Isaac W Smith with the title of Engineer Cascade Division Surveys the objective point at tidewater being Tacoma For this undertaking the old Indian trails or what remained in one case of an attempt at a waggon road were cleared as required and some new ones built Thus roads for pack animals were secured through a few known passes from which explorations were extended in any direction as the situation demanded Such ex plorations were the work of small parties of four or five men carry ing their outfits on their own backs each party being in charge of an experienced engineer They lasted days or weeks according to the state of supplies or the progress attained As snow does not quite disappear on the divide before July snowshoes were in many cases a necessity Toward the close of the same year a fair knowledge had been gained of the entire range from Mt Adams to Mt Baker excepting the part about the headwaters of Green River This stream from its sources to within a few miles of Puget Sound was still unknown Its lower reaches for twenty miles west of the foothills were in a crooked coulee oje hundred to three hundred feet in depth through which it rushed in cascades and rapids and among large rocks and treejams The forests once occupying the bench lands on either side of this coulee had been at some remote period de vastated by fire causing the disappearance of the smaller trees and leaving the charred remnants of the larger ones strewn upon the ground in masses and windrows A dense growth of fir brush fromStampede Pass Cascade Range Washington 241 twelve to forty feet in height had succeeded which in turn had been in places much bent over and broken down by the weight of heavy snows These conditions were noticeable along a belt some miles in width at the base of the foothills from White River to Snoqualmie River but were especially marked where Green River breaks out of the mountains They also extended eastward among the hills and along the streams Besides there were large and impassable swamps particularly in the region between White anid Green rivers On the southwestern border of this wilderness lived the tribe of Muckleshoot Indians but there were no white men except two settlers Geo W Vanderbeck and James McClin tock The Indians had a story that some of their number once crossed the jungle described reaching Mt Enemclaw a great cliff at the base of the foothills But beyond that point no living Indian had ever penetrated There was however a tradition of a trip made by one of their ancestors to the head waters of Green River where he found a pleasant country and good fishing As operations in other parts of the mountains proceeded the possibilities of the Green River region became a matter of growing interest It was remarked that no high peaks seemed to rise in that part of the range which the river drained and that even after prolonged rains the Water at its mouth was comparatively clear We therefore concluded it must flow through a country where landslides were infrequent and where consequently a railway would occupy safe ground It was finally decided to have the mysteries of this region cleared up and as a beginning Mr J Tilton Sheets an engineer well qualified for such work was sent to explore the main divide at the head of Green River With his base of supplies at Thorps Cabin a deserted log hut on the Yakima River east of the range three and onehalf miles below the present railway station of Easton he discovered two passes at the head of the main fork of Green River one of which he called Tacoma Pass and the other Sheets Pass He did not explore about the head of the north fork but concluded to descend the river to its mouth and report in person at Tacoma This he succeeded in doing in a trip of some days duration although his supplies ran short and the party suffered great hard ships arriving on Puget Sound worn out and nearly starved  These two streams receive their names from their marked colour That of the first is due to the glacial origin of some of its tributaries which head in Mt Rainier that of the second to the colour of the rocks and boulders over which it flows242 Stampede Pass Cascadle Range Washington While Mr Sheets principal object shortly became that of saving the lives of himself and men he was pleased with the topographical features of the country so far as observed and made a favorable report particularly of Tacoma Pass This was in October Re turning to Thorp via Portland and The Dalles on the Columbia River with a full party for instrumental work he was followed by Col Smith who personally directed the running of levels from Thorp to Tacoma Pass and the building of four cabins for the use of engineering parties in the following spring T hese cabins were located at intervals of about five miles Taking Tacoma Pass as a starting point one of them was four miles west ward on the main fork of Green River and the other three on Cabin Creek which heads in the pass and flows eastward into the Yakima These were named Cabins i 2 3 and 4 respectively No i being near the mouth of Cabin Creek not more than six miles above Thorp Operations were now suspended on account of the heavy and continuous snow storms of December the party descend ing the Yakima and separating at The Dalles Four men however were left on the upper Yakima two at Ellensburg to care for the stock and two at Thorp to take charge of supplies and await orders Two months previously I had been instructed to proceed to Spokane Falls then a little settlement of three to four hundred people and with a party organized there to explore the Cceur dAlene range from the pass crossed by the Mullan waggon trail northward toward Pend dOreille Lake t My return from this ex ploration was made via Walla Walla and Portland I reached Ta coma December 27th meeting instructions from Col Smith to make a reconnoissance of the Cascade range between Tacoma Pass and the head of Cedar River in order to cover the still unex plored region about the headwaters of Green River I was also to make such surveys of the several Green River passes as might seem advisable The work this time was to begin from the west side by cutting a trail across the jungle to Green River thence moving on up the stream till stopped by deep snows Here a base of supplies could  When the French Jesuits among whom was the famous Pere De Snmet under took the conversion

Pass Cascade Range Washington 243 be located progress beyond to be made on snowshoes With the help of John D McAllister the efficient commissary our prepara tions were soon made and I found myself on January I7th at the ranch ofJames McClintock one of the settlers mentioned Here was to be the base of supplies which could be reached by waggon My party all skilful woodsmen had preceded me some days and already cut their way into the jungle several miles We were well equipped with axes brushhooks saws camp outfit and a pack train of cayuse ponies We continued the trailcutting and building without delay the exploration and treeblazing which should indicate the route nat urally falling to my lot as the head of the expedition Usually one man accompanied me to provide against accidents A generally easterly course towards Mt Enemclaw was at first selected but as we neared the foothills and occasionally gained a point whence they could be seen the direction was gradually changed to a more northerly one We soon found that exploration for this trail was a serious matter Swamps and hollows impeded our progress and we had to force our way through fir thickets and over fallen tree trunks of great size There were many places where the under growth had been bent down by snow to a nearly horizontal posi tion forcing us to a choice between scrambling or walking over or crawling under on all fours We had many falls and were soon black and blue about the arms and legs Often at night when worn out by a day of such toil bruised scratched and sore and soaked to the skin our reflections were such as would hardly bear publication As usual in winter the rain fell in torrents much of the time forming morasses across our route where at another season few would have been found After having cut out the trail through the tangled masses of forest debris the party was therefore fre quently obliged to return and lay corduroy or build rough bridges of cedar puncheons to afford footing for the ponies While we made many detours to avoid labor kept the camp well toward the front and gradually increased the size of the party until forty or more well equipped men were employed our progress was exceed ingly slow Some days the impediments were so numerous that not more than fifteen hundred feet of actual advance could be made Still believing that our course ought to intersect Green River within a distance of twenty miles froin McClintocks and that once there we could perhaps get on faster and animated by an ambition to open a road across the jungle that had hitherto kept244 Stampede Pass Cascade Range Washington the Green River Water Shed tightly sealed against the intrusion of mankind we let no day go by without adding to the length of fin ished trail One evening I returned to camp with the news that during the day I had climbed to the summit of a high ridge undoubtedly part of a spur which followed would have led me down to Green River Also that from this ridge looking east ward I could see far into the mountains along the break formed by the course of the stream On January 26th but a few days after this we reached Green River at a point about fortyfour miles from Tacoma by the existing railway twelve in a direct line from McClintocks or sixteen following the sinuosities of the trail We now hoped to make more rapid progress but found ourselves in a canyon along whose rocky slopes the work was even more arduous than before every step of advance being met by some new difficulty to which rapidly deepening snow was soon added It rained or snowed almost constantly Before February many of the men weakened compelling me to relieve them but as their places were promptly filled this caused no serious delay Experience with other streams of the range had taught me that the canyon we were in would not be many miles long and that beyond it we should probably find bottom lands on one or both sides of the river And so it proved for on February 8th we reached a large tributary on whose border we camped finding the canyon beyond much less pronounced At this point occurred the first forest of good timber The snow now two or three feet deep forced us to stop all trailcutting for the time and to locate here the base of supplies for an advance on snowshoes This was Camp 7 where we remained until the 14th improving the trail be hind us and building a log cabin and shed We also commenced the construction of a canoe for boating supplies farther up Green River but soon abandoned it because a little exploration disclosed many rapids and tree jams in the stream above This circumstance however gave the name to both stream and camp which were thereafter known as Canoe Creek Leaving some of the men behind to resume the cutting of the trail as the snow should permit I started on with those best fitted for my purpose a part of them bearing packs on their backs the others hauling loads on sleds and all travelling on snowshoes Our progress across ravines projecting spurs and swamps through brush and over fallen trees was slow and exasperating Occasion ally a man would go half out of sight in some cavity beneath the snow or stumbling roll down a slope until stopped by bushes orStampede Pass Cascade Racnge Washington 245 logs As all were equally liable to these mishaps no ill feeling was caused by the laughter that greeted their occurrence The sleds an importation from British Columbia where they are much used by voyageurs and prospectors proved hardly satisfactory on such rough ground They were often bottom up and in getting over many places only furnished an additional burden for the men to carry However before night we reached a place already selected by previous exploration suitable for a cache This was about five miles from Canoe Creek by our trail and at the mouth of a brook some twenty feet wide which became known as Cache Creek The next morning we cached some of our supplies and I detached several men from the party to bring more fromi Canoe Creek until a certain quantity was accumulated By this time they would get word to follow on with provisions to some other camp indicated by me in order to prevent detention of the leading party by lack of food A party following could always overtake the one ahead its road being already marked out by the latter which lost much time in waiting for explorations to determine its route In making further advance we encountered the usual diffi culties and in addition to them the necessity of crossing the river a most difficult accomplishment at that time This we were forced to do because of a precipitous mountain which obstructed our progress on the south side where we had hitherto held our way But on the evening of the Igth we camped in the canyon about one mile above the present railway station of Eagle Gorge on the north bank This was Camp IO the distance from Tacoma by present railway line being fiftyone miles And now began a rain which lasted with practically no intermission for four days filling all the streams and gullies and causing the river to rise to a height I had not supposed possible Our bridge which consisted of two great footlogs one across a slough and the other across the main channel of the river was threatened but fortunately held its own During these days all we could do was to remain in camp keeping up the fires and speculating on the doings in the camps below and our chances ahead On the morning of the 24th the cessation of rain permitted a resumption of our efforts We had not gone far when the fog which had shrouded us suddenly lifted revealing a comparatively open space on which the sun shone brightly bringing courage and hope to our spirits depressed by recent experiences Just at this moment we caught sight of a large eagle flying about in widening circles directly above our heads This appear246 Stampede Pass Cascade Range Washington ance which seemed to all a good omen furnished a timely sugges tion as to a name for the canyon we were leaving and ever since it has been known as Eagle Gorge Progress continued slow and laborious the principal obstacles now being the sloughs and channels which frequently cut through the bottom lands Accumulations of driftwood the dense under growth and the soft snow liable to give way at any moment pre cipitating one into a pool of icecold water added not inconsidera bly to our annoyances But on March 2d we reached Camp 13 among a number of fir trees of immense size and about a mile above a stream called by the two Indians of the party Smay Creek This point is sixty miles froin Tacoma by the present railway Meantime although our supplies had been replenished from Cache Creek the outlook was not encouragilng for with a party of ten provisions disappeared rapidly All had suffered greatly from exposure and labour under such unfavorable conditions and were discouraged But some time previously I had learned from Col Smith that the two men at Ellensburg were to go on to Thorp and with those remaining there convey such supplies as they could pack on their backs across Tacoma Pass going from cabin to cabin until they reached Cabin 4 thence on as far down Green River as possible where they were to build another cabin Cabin 5 and try to make connection with us In view of this fact and our present plight and believing that if these instructions had been executed we could not be many days journey from Cabin 5 I decided before we again sought the repose of our blankets to push on with only three men and make a spurt that should hurry the expedition to a conclusion Accordingly all hands were called out early the morning of the 3d From among them I selected one as foreman and put him in charge of opera tions between Canoe Creek and Smay Creek with orders to have more provisions packed up to the latter camp those at the former being replenished from time to time by the Commissary The men were then named to accompany me the principal one being Joseph Wilson a Canadian voyageur and prospector about fiftyfive years of age An accomplished woodsman he had a physique that endured any hardship and was withal intelligent and kindhearted The others were Indians Peter and Charley Our outfit which was as light as we dared miake it consisted of one or two blankets each besides our rubber blankets a small fly a fry ing pan tinkettle and coffeepot and a few provisions principally flour baking powder beans bacon and coffeeSttampede Pass Cascade Range Washington 247 We parted from the others and soon lost sight of them Our progress being slow and difficult we took to a ridge which we thought might parallel the course of the river and afford us a more rapid and certain route But after some time we found ourselves getting farther and farther away from the stream and were obliged with what speed we could make to again descend towards the river bottoms In this way little direct progress was made that day and we encamped at night in a hollow of the hillside above some warm springs which have now become well known being near the present railway station of Hot Springs sixtytwo miles from Tacoma The next morning our route lay among large fir trees on the north side where the accumulations of snow covered so much of the forest debris as to permit faster travel on snowshoes than had hitherto been possible At noon when we had stopped to make coffee it was thought best to send back the two Indians who by remaining with us would soon demolish our small stock of provisions I therefore told them to return to Smay Creek get more supplies and then follow on our trail until they should overtake us wherever that might be Wilson and I pressed on making camp I5 at a late hour near the mouth of what seemed to be a slough of Green River We concluded we must be near Cabin 5 and that the following day we should keep a sharp lookout for any sign of white men But in spite of diligent search no trace of our friends appeared along our route which had been as close to the stream as the undergrowth permitted in order to discover any large fork coming in on the south If one became visible the plan was to cross and explore it for some distance at least with the hope that it might be the main stream where would be found some sign of those we sought The view however was much obstructed the south side appearing in occasional glimpses steep and forbidding while on the north there was little to oppose our progress in the open forest We were moving on the line of least resistance Toward night we camped in the angle between two creeks each about fifty feet wide which united to form the stream that had been our guide through the day Some further search was then made but without result excepting a full consideration of our situ ation as we sat by the evening campfire We were certain that no large fork had been passed on the north side since leaving Smay Creek a fact leading plainly up to the inference that one of the two creeks meeting at our camp must be Green River proper while the other was its north fork that is unless our keeping to the248 Stampede Pass Cascade Range Washington north side had lost us the main stream altogether in the dense forest Although the latter supposition appeared after all the correct one we did not like to abandon our position without exploration of the two streams mentioned The north fork reported to have been seen by Mr Sheets might be one of these creeks or possibly the one we had been following during the day or even some other stream yet to be discovered Green River was doubtless made up of several tributaries coming in from the main and lateral divides We were among forestcovered mountains permitting no view that might settle the vexed question of the location of the main watercourse and its north fork The only plan therefore promising success was to examine everything as we went along and to do this most thoroughly we must make a laborious ascent of the hillside opposite on the north follow its slope around eastward and finally toward the south crossing the creeks higher up between the camp and the divide This would take us over many ravines and ridges but would insure our cross ing the trail of our friends if it lay along any of the watercourses found But in spite of our hopes the two days thus consumed seemed lost so far as any clue to the whereabouts of the other party was concerned and we became satisfied that the search must be made elsewhere However it appeared best to put in another day here and thus make this presumption a certainty We had to endure constant discomforts caused by the weather and our situation not the least of which was the effort to dodge the masses of soft snow falling at intervals from the trees while we were on the march But even with our fatigue and the annoyance caused by a growing belief that we had struck the wrong track and had thereby lost several precious days there came to us a deter mination to see our mission through at whatever cost of trouble or hardship And to speak without exaggeration matters were becoming somewhat serious Our supplies scant enough at first be it always remembered on account of the difficulty of transportation were now nearly gone and there was no present assurance of more under existing circumstances For the finding of the other party had through our mishap become a very uncertain matter and on the Indians we feared there could be placed but little dependence Hence it appeared necessary to at once do something to help our selves Wilson then proposed to return alone to Smay Creek or till he met the Indians and take from them the provisions while they turned back to procure more His proposition meeting myStampede Pass Cascade Range Washington 249 approval he started out with a small pack early on the morning of March 7th expecting to be gone two days Being left alone I continued the unfinished work of the day before Climbing the spur behind the camp I struck out along a ridge towards the main divide and consumed a good part of the day in fruitless examinations There was nothing to indicate that any man had ever preceded me here But on my return when about a mile from camp and retracing my path of the morning I came upon the footprints of a wolf The creature had crossed the ravine from the north and on meeting my tracks had turned and kept along them toward camp I had seen but few signs of animals for weeks and was quite unprepared to find these now fresh and clean cut on the white snow leading in that particular direction But Mr Wolf must have changed his apparent intention of raiding our illstocked larder for his path soon left mine turning down a slope and into a ravine on the south As there still remained some what of daylight I passed beyond the camp along the creek to the northeast more to see the fine fir trees than for any other purpose In a few moments there appeared more footprints this time those of a big bear partly obliterated by recent snowfalls and about a hollow tree which had evidently been his winter quarters He must have been out a few days before but not satisfied with the weather had returned to sleep the rest of the season In the lengthening shadows I prepared a solitary supper and ate it without my usual appetite and as quietly as possible Sitting by the fire thinking over my situation I realized that it was some what dangerous especially as I supposed Wilson to befifteen or twenty miles away Firearms there were none except my re volver which could hardly be taken into account not having been discharged for months But the reflection that never in my own experience had I known harm to come from wild beasts greatly served to still my fears already partially lulled by Natures potent soporific fatigue I therefore crawled into my blankets and com posed myself for sleep in the best manner possible under the circumstances I had become fairly tranquil speculating dreamily on the proba bility of an awakening before morning caused by the howling of wolves or by the intrusion of a bears snout among my blankets when roused to an acute perception of surrounding things A sudden loud snap painfully audible in the stillness of the night as of a branch breaking on the other side of the stream I felt sure was caused by the bear which might at any moment approach my250 Stampede Pass Cascade Range HWashington resting place In this I was however presently proved mistaken as WNilson and not Bruin peered in under the fly saying cheerfully Boss are you asleep  He had met the Indians and taken from them most of the pro visions sending them back for more A long weary day he had made of it and as he told his story I conceived a gratitude and friendship for him which I shall never lose For in spite of a fatigue so extreme that he felt feet and legs could endure no longer he had left his snowshoes on some bushes crawling on hands and knees the rest of his journey more than half a mile and all because he felt it his duty to return to me that night W1e were now confident of being on a north fork instead of the mnain stream To regain the latter we must retrace our footsteps carefully on the lookout for its mouth on the south side The start the next morning was a late one our rest after so much fatigue having been undisturbed long and refreshing Departing from this abiding place of uncertainties we christened it Lost Camp while the north fork became known as Sunday Creek Keeping as close to the creek as possible we observed no change either in forest or stream for nearly three hours when appeared a compara tively wide basin such as might be looked for at the junction of two watercourses Wilson pressing forward through the heavy undergrowth said there were indications of a large tributary on the other side a little below and that we had better cross and explore This we did partly on driftwood and partly wading and were soon repaid for our efforts by the sight of a stream considerable enough RN    IE ON GRERVRStampede Pass Cascade Range Washington 251 in size to assure us that it was the main river Following it as we had already planned in less than half an hour we suddenly came upon the nearly obliterated imprints of snowshoes All these led eastward or up stream and could only have been made by the men who were to build Cabin 5 They had evidently done what they could and returned to Thorp Tracing back the snowshoe tracks a few hundred feet across the stream we found the cabin a rude affair evidently built in haste There being nothing in or about it to detain us more than a moment we pushed forward intent on going as far as possible before night fall following the trail of our friends leading across Tacoma Pass to Thorp Success raised our spirits giving us new strength for the rapid journey of the day About 300 PM Cabin 4 appeared so buried in the snow that a descent of some feet was necessary to reach it We entered through the door left purposely unfastened by the party preceding us and were rejoiced at the sight of a rough fireplace provisions and utensils for cooking them As we had eaten nothing since morning this opportunity was by no means neglected Leaving here such articles and supplies as could be safely dispensed with we started again intending to reach Cabin 3 before night The hills soon closed in upon us steep and slippery The stream which now plunged in cascades down a gorge was bridged in many places by footlogs placed from ten to forty feet above the torrent whose crossing was perilous while the ascent beyond became slow and toilsome When we finally arrived at the summit fastfalling snow and approaching darkness made it difficult to read the two aneroid barometers I had carried throughout these journeys Over the descent on the east night fell suddenly shutting out all signs of the trail and leaving only as a guide the features of the ground which kept us in the depression between the hills Travelling thus for about an hour we came abruptly upon a big mound of snow which on close inspection proved to be Cabin 3 This was only a bare shelter where we made a light supper on some food we still had with us and passed a comfortable night early dawn seeing us on our way The course was now nearly all down hill The woods were comparatively open the trail was well marked and the snow which covered many obstructions in good condition for snowshoeing Thus it was that we made a rapid march reaching Thorp before dark and meeting the men we sought They had arrived but three days before and were prepar ing to return to Cabin 5 with more supplies Having sent Wilson and a companion to Tacoma with a report252 Stamnpede Pass Cascade Range Washizngton of our trip I left Thorp on the I4th and went to Cabin 3 where supplies for the proposed expedition northward along the range had preceded me One man had been left behind in care of the place and with instructions to observe and note the readings of an aneroid at morning noon and evening of each day of our ab sence The remaining three men James Gregg Andy Drury and Mathew Champion accompanied me The next day we explored about Tacoma Pass and Sheets Pass On the i6th everything being in readiness we started northward following a tributary of Cabin Creek to its source on a spur elevation 4400 ft where we camped for the night in deep snow among balsam trees and within a short distance of the main divide In the morning we climbed to the top where there was but little timber and where the range was sharp and well defined with a course nearly due north Progress was rapid until afternoon when the general direction curved to the northeast and a mountain confronted us up whose sides the forest extended to its very peak At its summit the barometer marked nearly 5500 ft elevation Here the timber ceased abruptly affording a grand panorama of the surrounding mountains except towards the north where projecting spurs and the forest cut off the view Our course was now nearly due east until we reached a much lower elevation where we called a halt for the night At the be ginning of the descent one of Andy Drurys snowshoes caught in the other throwing him headlong down a steep slope and plung ing him into the snow nearly out of sight From this incident came the name of the mountain SnowShoe Butte The railway now skirts a portion of its base For several days we had been blessed with fairly good weather but the next was one of the most dismal I remember having seen It blew a gale and was severely cold With the wind came a thick fog which added to the gloom of the balsam forest made our movements groping and uncertain The moisture seemed to congeal in small sharp crystals which found lodgment in every wrinkle or fold of our clothing and also made it difficult to face the wind Making for the highest ground we did our best to follow the divide whose crest was no longer clearly defined This however soon changed its course from an easterly to a southeasterly one and also fell off rapidly in eleva tion As we felt our way along the constantly descending course of the ridge led us to conclude that since morning we had some how missed the main range and must be following a spur which would lead to Yakima River So little was visible that some briefStampede Pass Cascade Range WYashington 253 explorations only added to the uncertainty and we spent the whole day crawling about the northerly slopes of the mountain in the endeavor to find a ridge so decidedly bearing north as to give assurance that it was the main divide At night we brought up near the previous nights camping place annoyed at the loss of time but now quite certain that our morning journey was in the right direction and that if we had pursued the ridge farther we should have come to a bend to the north an indication that it was none other than the main range Those who have ever had occasion to trace an unknown divide where the view is cut off by dense forests understand how easy it is to get astray on some spur or lateral ridge and follow it per haps for hours before the mistake is discovered Starting early on the igth with our route for the morning at least quite settled upon and with favouring skies that lightened our hearts we made excellent progress A little after nine oclock appeared a sharp bend in the ridge to the north as antici pated whence we descended along a welldefined crest so rapidly that in less than an hour the barometer marked only 3495 feet elevation at a point where for a little distance about us there were no trees It was evidently one of the lowest parts of the divide To the east a spur cut off much of our view but facing west we looked down Sunday Creek Beyond its confluence with Green River were the mountains to the south covered with dark fir forests and back of them the great snowy mass of Mt Rainier Tacoma sharply defined against the blue sky It was a beautiful scene and so impressive that for a moment all were silent Thenice we continued our trip northward finding several other depressions in the range but none as promising as the one just described We finally descended from the divide to Lake Kitch clos the source of the Yakima arriving at Thorp the afternoon of the 23d The exploration now finished although toilsome and often dis couraging had made the Green River region accessible Surveys which then succeeded were followed by the building of the Cascade  The peak was

discovered but later it was named Stampede Pass from the following incident Some weeks after its discovery while encamped on Sunday Creek I became dissatisfied with the progress of the party cutting trails which would be required before instrumental surveys could be ex tended across the divide and sent them a foreman well known as a hard worker His arrival became the signal for the flight of several men from the locality which was but a few hundred feet west of the summit and which thus obtained a name both their camp and the small lake near it and later the Pass itself being called Stampede The elevation of the Pass as corrected by the aneroid at Thorp whose elevation was known from instrumental survey proved to be 3725 feet As determined by spirit level it is 3693 feet The summit tunnel 9850 feet in length reduces this figure to 2850 feet The traveller of today who crosses the Cascade Range with the ease and rapidity made possible by the railway cannot realize that

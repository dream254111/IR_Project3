FROM DOING BUSINESS OR FROM ENTERING OR CARRYING ON AN OCCUPATION I THE MERE CONTRACT TO REFRAIN FROM DOING BusINEss OR FROM ENTERING OR CARRYING ON AN OCCUPATION Twas long ago assumed that a contract not to engage in a given business or occupation would be void where the promisor was already engaged in it and the promisee was not and did not intend to be The reasons alleged were the disregard of the social interest in the freedom of individuals to enter whatever business they pleased the mischief to the party by the loss of his livelihood and the subsistence of his family the mischief to the public by depriving it of a useful member and the tendency toward monopoly The last would seem to be negligible Today such is the freedom and I Mitchel v Reynolds i P Wims i8i 9    for suppose as that case seems to be a poor weaver having just met with a great loss should in a fit of passion and concern be exclaiming against his trade and declare that he would not follow it any more etc at which instant some designing fellow should work him up to such a pitch as for a trifling matter to give a bond not to work it again and afterwards when the necessities of his family and the cries of his children send him to the loom should take advantage of the forfeiture and put the bond in suit I must own I think this such a piece of villainy as is hard to find a name for and therefore cannot but

great concern The same changes make it less likely than formerly that the public will feel the loss of the service of any of its members2 But the social interest in all being free to enter whatever business they please is still so far operative that the mere contract to refrain from carrying on a business or occupation will be void This last consideration would it is believed be sufficient to invalidate the contract even though the promisor had not at the time of his promise entered any business or occupation at all and was not contemplating doing so The above conclusions presuppose the fact that the business is one which the public is interested in having carried on If the business or occupation is one which while lawful is regarded as contrary to the public interest such as the liquor business it has been held that the mere contract to refrain from entering or carry ing on such a business is valid3 2 Herreshoff v Boutineau 17 R I 3 6 i9 Atl 7I2 quotation given post note 13 But see Kellogg v Larkin 3 Pinn Wis I23 15I The loss to society of a valuable member is as great a public injury now as it ever was and as great here as anywhere I hope indeed that the market value of a human being is higher now than it was in Eng land at the beginning of the eighteenth century when the case of Mitchel v Reynolds was decided The capacity of an individual to produce using that wdrd in its largest sense constitutes his value to the public That branch of industry in which a man has been educated and to which he is accustomed and for the abandonment of which he demands compensation is supposed to be the one in which he can render the greatest profit The value of what he produces belongs to himself The actual product belongs immediately to him who employs him but mediately to the state and goes to swell the aggregate of public wealth Therefore the law says to each and every tradesman You shall not for a present sum in hand alien your right to pursue that calling by which you can produce the most and add the most to the public wealth and compel yourself to a life of supineness and inaction or to labor in some department less profitable to the state And if any man mindful of his own gain alone but not of the public good will bargain with you to that effect you are held discharged from such bargain because of the advantage that will arise to the public from so holding 3 Harrison v Lockhart 25 Ind II2 McAlister v Howell 42 Ind I5CONTRACTS TO REFRAIN FROM DOING BUSINESS I95 II RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS ACCOMPANYING THE PROMISORS ENTRY INTO AN APPRENTICESHIP ARRANGEMENT OR MADE UPON HIS ENTRY INTO THE SERVICE OF THE PROMISEE FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEARNING A TRADE OR BUSINESS We have the following possible considerations against the validity of such covenants The social interest in the freedom of individuals to enter what business they please is violated The contract tends to deprive the promisor of his livelihood the public of a useful member and to eliminate competition between the promisor and the promisee On the other side we have the desira bility of permitting the teaching of apprentices or employees by masters This involves providing the means whereby they may obtain their instruction on the best terms possible The apprentice must purchase the instruction Practically the easiest way for him to do it is to give his services in part payment and a covenant not to compete in lieu of the balance If the covenant not to compete is not allowed the apprentice or employee must pay cash on the basis that the master is training a competitor The result would be poor instruction and a price which an apprentice or employee would find difficulty in meeting If the restriction is not broader than the business of the master the apprentice would have a large territory in which to carry on the trade or business which he has learned and other apprentices learning the same trade in other districts could come into the district of the master and there compete with him Upon a balancing of the interests it is clear that where the restriction given by the apprentice or employee is not broader than the masters business it is valid4 Nor is it any objection to the restriction that it is to continue for the life of the covenantor and hence may continue after the master has died or gone out of business5 The covenant is still an asset of the masters estate after he is dead or when he sells his business or takes in a partner Where he has abandoned his 4 Rousillon v Rousillon I4 Ch D 351 Badische v Schott 1892 3 Ch 447 Machine Co v Morse

nominal Formerly it was said that the consideration must be good and adequate so as to make it a proper and useful contract6 The later view is that a legal consideration which is also of some value must be given But apparently the court will not undertake to weigh the value of the consideration against what is given in order to determine its adequacy7 Suppose however that a countrywide business should exact such restrictive covenants of all employees entering business or of all persons entering the business in any executive capacity so that they would have no choice but to stay or change their occu pation completely Would not the balance of considerations be against supporting the validity of such arrangements Here the loss of a livelihood might be a reality The public might in fact be deprived of a useful member The tendency toward monopoly might become decisive The hiring in such a business is not really for the purpose of training men to go out and conduct a similar business but rather with the object of keeping them permanently A restriction then upon their going into any other similar business could hardly be regarded as a part of the price for teaching them Rather must it be looked upon as a method of hampering the employers competitors Hence such wholesale restrictions would 6 Mitchel v Reynolds i P Wms i8I 41 Particular restraints are either first without

no means whatever to execute It is impossible for the Court looking at the record to say whether in any particular case the party restrained has made an improvi dent bargain or not The receiving instruction in a particular trade might be of much greater value to a man in one condition of life than in another and the same may be observed as to other considerations It is enough as it appears to

from carrying on a particular business National Benefit Co v Union Hospital Co 45 Minn 272 47 N W 8o6 96 A contract may be illegal on grounds of public policy because in restraint of trade but it is of paramount public policy not lightly to interfere with freedom of contract United States Chemical Co v Provident Chemical Co 64 Fed 946 I021 In discussing this phase of the subject we must not lose sight of some other principles the disregard of which would be more harmful to public interest than monopolies The right to contract is a cardinal element of constitutional liberty and as such should be jealously guarded Anchor Electric Co v Hawkes 17I Mass ioi I05 50 N E 509 The general principle that arrangements in re straint of trade are not favored is however firmly established in law and now as well as formerly is given effect whenever its application will not interfere with the right of everybody to make reasonable contracts Whenever one sells a business with its good will it is for his benefit as well as for the benefit of the purchaser that he should be able to increase the value of that which he sells by a contract not to set up a new business in competition with the old Smiths Appeal II3 Pa St 579 590 6 Atl 251 The principle is this public policy requires that every man shall not be at liberty to deprive himself or the state of his labor skill or talent by any contract that he enters into On the other hand public policy requires that when aI98 HARVARD LAW REVIEW any social interest in the freedom of individuals to enter what business they please Formerly it was urged against the restriction that the seller might become a charge upon the community because he could not carry on his trade or business10 This was at once met by the requirement that the seller must have received a substantial con sideration for the sale of his business11 Recently however this requirement has been held to be satisfied if some consideration of value in addition to or including the consideration necessary to make a contract is given The courts will not go into the adequacy of the consideration in each particular case but will rely upon the seller obtaining in general the fair equivalent for the sale of his business2 Today however the fear of the seller becoming a charge man has by skill or by any other means obtained something which he wants to so sell he should be at liberty to sell it in the most advantageous way in the market and in order to enable him to sell it it is necessary that he should be able to preclude him self from entering into competition with the purchaser Trenton Potteries Co v Oliphant 58 N J Eq 507 43 Atl 723 I651 A tradesman for example who has engaged in a manufacturing business and has purchased land installed a plant and acquired a trade connection and good will thereby may sell his property and busi ness with its good will It is of public interest that he shall be able to make such a sale at a fair price and that his purchaser shall be able to obtain by his purchase that which he desired to buy Obviously the only practical mode of accomplishing that purpose is by the vendors contracting for some restraint upon his acts prevent ing him from engaging in the same business in competition with that which he has sold Kellogg v Larkin 3 Pinn Wis I23 I42 10 Mitchel v Reynolds i P Wms i8i 17 The true reasons of the distinction upon which the judgments in these cases of voluntary restraints are founded are first the mischief which may arise from them first to the party by the loss of his livelihood and the subsistence of his family secondly to the public by depriving it of a useful member Gamewell FireAlarm Co v Crane i6o Mass 50 35 N E 98 55 To exclude a person from manufacturing or selling anywhere in

the seller may take the consideration and start else has placed himself we feel ourselves bound to differ from that doctrine A duty would thereby be imposed upon the Court in every particular case which it has no means whatever to execute It is impossible for the Court looking at the record to say whether in any particular case the party restrained has made an improvident bargain or not The receiving instruction in a particular trade might be of much greater value to a man in one condition of life than in another and the same may be observed as to other considerations It is enough as it appears to us that there actually is a consideration for the bargain and that such consideration is a legal consideration and of some value Such appears to be the case in the present instance where the defendant is retained and employed at an annual salary Lawrence v Kidder io Barb N Y 64I 649 In many of the early cases the language of the Courts would seem to imply that the adequacy or extent of the consideration had something to do with the validity of the contract They say that a mere pecuniary consideration is not sufficient that there must be something although it does not appear very clearly what added to this to support the contract This idea however of the necessity of any greater or other consideration for a contract of this description than any other was obviously unfounded and has been exploded by the recent cases Hitchcock v Coker i M  G i85 Green v Price I3 M  W 698 Duffy v Shockey II Ind 70 73 As to the question of the adequacy of the consideration we are inclined to view this as we would any other contract made by parties capable of contracting They should in the absence of fraud be presumed to have determined that point for themselves   This presumption is peculiarly proper in this case for the reason that we are left in doubt as to how much the consideration to be paid by the defendant was In addition to the 300 dollars he was to relieve the plaintiffs from their contracts with agents  to what amount we are not informed  he was to take the marble carved or not remaining after the completion of the outstanding contracts of plaintiffs The value of the marble thus disposed of is not given He was also to buy of plaintiffs marble at fixed prices but whether those prices were advantageous to the plaintiffs or defendant we are not apprised by the pleadings or evidence Hubbard v Miller 27 Mich I5 25 The fact that complainant paid no more than the cost of the articles at Grand Haven can make no difference Where a consideration recognized by law as being valuable is paid the law very properly allows the parties to judge for themselves of the sufficiency in value of such considera tion for their contracts We cannot therefore enter into the question whether the consideration was commensurate in value with the restraint imposed See Hitchcock v Coker 6 A  E 438 Pilkington v Scott 15 M  W 657 Hartley v Cummings 5 C B 247 And there is no reason for holding that without the restraint contracted for complainant would have been willing to purchase for the price he gave nor can we say that the vendors could have sold at that price without such stipulation In fact we must infer that in their opinion they could not readily have done so without it or they would not have given it It is clear at all events that they thought the sale with the stipulation an advantageous one or they would not have made it The contract must therefore be held fair reasonable and valid unless too general and unlimited as to place as insisted under the second objection See also Holbrook v Waters 9 How Pr N Y 335 Pierce v Fuller 8 Mass 223 a consideration of one dollar deemed sufficient to support the restrictive covenant In Chapin v Brown 83 Iowa i56 48 N W 1074 138 it would seem that the Court200 HARVARD LAW REVIEW where If the business is so large that the restriction probably covers a wide area the consideration paid to the seller will usually be such as to keep him from becoming a public charge3 Where the restriction is given by a corporation the fear that the promisor will become a public charge has no place14 regarded the evidence concerning the particular transaction as failing to show any ade quate consideration This can hardly be supported because the recitals of the contract itself showed plainly that the seller was parting with a losing branch of his business without having it fall into the hands of those who competed with him in his other lines of business The consideration was legally sufficient to make a contract and it was a business transaction on its face in which a consideration of value was given for the restriction 13 Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt Guns  Ammunition Co i894 A C 535 331 The fact that the seller had become a pauper in the particular case made no difference Anchor Electric Co v Hawkes I71 Mass I0I 105 5o N E 509 The changes in the methods of doing business and the increased freedom of communication which have come in recent years have very materially modified the view to be taken of particular contracts in reference to trade The comparative ease with which one engaged in busi ness can turn his energies to a new occupation if he contracts to give up his old one makes the hardship of such a contract much less for the individual than formerly and the commercial opportunities which open the markets of the world to the merchants of every country leave little danger to the community from an agreement of an individual to cease to work in a particular field Herreshoff v Boutineau I7 R I 3 6 ig Atl 7I2 In the days of the early English cases one who could not work at his trade could hardly work at all The avenues to occupation were not as open nor as numerous as now and one rarely got out of the path he started in Contracting not to follow ones trade was about the same as contracting to be idle or to go abroad for employment But this is not so now It is an everyday occurrence to see men busy and prosperous in other pursuits than those to which they were trained in youth as well as to see them change places and occupations without depriving themselves of the means of livelihood or the State of the benefit of their industry It would therefore be absurd in the light of this common experience now to say that a man shuts himself up to idleness or to expatriation and thus injures the public when he agrees for a sufficient consideration not to follow some one calling within the limits of a particular State There is no expatriation in moving from one State to another and from such removals a State would be likely to gain as many as it would lose Kellogg v Larkin 3 Pinn Wis 123 1149 The opportunities for employment are so abundant and the demand for labor on all sides is so pressing and urgent and the supply so limited that I much question were we to consider the subject as res integral if we should feel au thorized to hold that a man had endangered his own livelihood and the subsistence of his family by an agreement which merely excluded him from exercising the trade of a blacksmith or a shoemaker leaving all the other departments of mechanical agri cultural and commercial industry open to him 14 United States Chemical Co v Provident Chemical Co 64 Fed 946 1021 Among the potent reasons first assigned against such contracts was that the person restrained by thus surrendering his chosen occupation  one for which he has been especially prepared  might become a public charge and the public be injured in being deprived of his personal skill in the avocation to which he had been brought up Such reasons cannot be applied to artificial persons without absurdityCONTRACTS TO REFRAIN FROM DOING BUSINESS 201 Another ground formerly expressed for holding invalid these restrictive covenants was that they might leave a given community unserved by anyone capable of carrying on a given business5 This may have been an important consideration in the case of a business confined to a small territory at a time when others could not mobilize readily at a given point It is out of place today when the ease and freedom of transportation are such that if one man goes out of business in a given locality there is little need to fear that the public will suffer by reason of the failure of anyone to serve it16 Besides when a business is sold by one to another the public is substantially as well off as it was before The tendency to monopoly by the elimination of competition is in this class of cases the slightest No existing competition has been eliminated One man has taken anothers place It is doubtful and entirely speculative whether the buyer would have competed if he could not have purchased About all that can be said is that there is less probability that the purchaser would have competed if he could not have bought than that the seller would compete if he had not entered into a restrictive covenant7 If the restriction is not broader than the business sold but 16 Mitchel v Reynolds i P Wms i8i 71 ante note io 16 Diamond Match Co v Roeber io6 N Y 473 13 N E 4I9 1591 He Parker C J in Mitchel v Reynolds refers to other reasons viz the mischief which may arise i to the party by the loss by the obligor of his livelihood and the subsistence of his family and 2 to the public by depriving it of a useful member and by enabling corporations to gain control of the trade of the kingdom It is quite obvious that some of these reasons are much less forcible now than when Mitchel v Reynolds was decided Steam and electricity have for the purposes of trade and commerce almost annihilated distance and the whole world is now a mart for the distribution of the products of in dustry The great diffusion of wealth and the restless activity of mankind striving to better their condition have greatly enlarged the field of human enterprise and created a vast number of new industries which give scope to ingenuity and employ ment for capital and labor National Benefit Co v Union Hospital Co 45 Minn 27247 N W 8o6 96 Moreover as cheaper and more rapid facilities for travel and transportation gradually changed the manner of doing business so as to enable par ties to conduct it over a vastly greater territory than formerly the Courts were necessarily compelled to readjust the test or standard of the reasonableness of re strictions as to place 17 A restrictive covenant may be found to be expressed by interpretation from the sale of a business and good will in which case the covenantor cannot hold himself out as carrying on his former business at a new address Halls Appeal 6o Pa St 458 The assignment by two out of three covenantees to the third of the business pro tected by the covenant operates as an assignment of the covenant to the third and he may release it to the covenantor Gompers v Rochester 56 Pa St 194202 HARVARD LA W REVIEW extends up to or beyond the limits of any state where it is opera tive it should still be held valid The rational test is the extent of the business sold and not the boundaries of some political sub division of the country This is the view of the more recent cases where the restriction has been held valid even when the sale was to a competitor8 The argument that such restrictions tend to force the promisor to leave the state is answered by the fact that this does not cause him to leave his country and that what is lost by one man leaving the state is gained by others coming into the state9 The older decisions for a time at least appear to have made an arbitrary rule that a restriction which operated through out a state was generally void even though not broader than the business sold20 If the restriction is broader than the business sold and the business sold is not coextensive with the boundaries of the United States it is void2 The seller is doing more than sell what he has 18 Nordenfelt v Maxim Nordenfelt

fifteen competitors in the United States to another In some cases the courts have not been careful to determine whether the restriction as to territory was broader than the actual extent of the sellers business or not Diamond Match Co v Roeber io6 N Y 473 I3 N E 4I9 55l Gamewell FireAlarm Co v Crane i6o Mass 50 35 N E 98 54 In Tode v Gross I27 N Y 480 28 N E 469 where the business sold was de pendent upon a secret process which was also sold no inquiry seems to have been made as to whether the covenant which was unlimited was broader than the business sold But in Watertown Thermometer Co v Pool 5i Hun N Y 157 the court seemsCONTRACTS TO REFRAIN FROM DOING BUSINESS 203 He is selling a business in which he might engage in the future The public policy therefore in favor of his being permitted to sell what he has freely and at the best price is not applicable The social interest in freedom of individuals to enter what business they please is not balanced by any social interest in freedom to sell at the best price obtainable It may be that today there is little danger that the seller will become a charge on the community22 but that the public may be deprived of the benefit of his entering the business and that a possible competitor may be eliminated constitute an appreciable danger23 It has even been suggested that the fact that the restriction is broader than the business sold gives rise to the inference that it is exacted for the actual purpose of monopoly24 but this seems hardly so today The restriction may be broader than the business sold because it relates to a territorial area larger than that in which the business was carried on25 or because it concerns a related business which was not actually carried on by the seller26 When a professional man sells his practice and covenants not to carry it on in the place in question for the remainder of his to have sustained a restrictive covenant which was broader than the business sold going upon the reasonableness of the advantage of the vendee 22 But see Gamewell FireAlarm Co v Crane i6o Mass 50 35 N E 98 551 To exclude a person from manufacturing or selling anywhere in the United States or in the world machinery designed for certain purposes in which that person has acquired great skill may operate to impair his means of earning a living 23 Bishop v Palmer I46 Mass 469 i6 N E 299 48 Two principal grounds on which such contracts are held to be void are that they tend to deprive the public of the services of men in the employments and capacities in which they may be most useful and that they expose the public to the evils of monopoly Gamewell Fire Alarm Co v Crane i6o Mass 50 35 N E 98 55 The principal object of the stipulation was we think to prevent the manufacture or sale by the defendant of any instruments which would serve the same purpose as those made and sold by the plaintiff and thus to enable the plaintiff more completely to control the market 24 Mitchel v Reynolds i P Wms i8i 9 It shows why a contract not to trade in any part of England though with consideration is void for there is something more than a presumption against it because it can never be useful to any man to restrain another from trading in all places though it may be to restrain him frotn trading in some unless he intends a monopoly which is a crime 25 Bishop v Palmer I46 Mass 469 i6 N E 299

with the buyer either directly or indirectly X6 per Van Fleet V C in Mandeville v Harman 42 N J Eq i85 I93 7 Atl 37 32 note 91204 HARVARD LAW REVIEW life it has been argued that the restriction is broader than the necessities of the case require since it would still be in operation if the buyer abandoned practice or died in the lifetime of the seller27 The reply is that just as the seller has sold his practice to the buyer so the buyer may again sell his practice to another buyer or take in a partner28 Even if the first buyer dies in the lifetime of the seller the fact that he had a practice protected from the sellers competition may make his practice an asset which his administrator can sell29 Furthermore the buyer purchased the sellers practice which means the practice which the seller could do during his life It would hamper such transactions too much if the covenant had to be worded so as to take care of all the con tingencies under which the restriction might cease to be of value to the buyer Covenants which seem to be broader than the sellers business may be divisible so that the separable part which is not broader than the sellers business may be enforced30 If the business sold is coextensive with the boundaries of the United States but the restriction is worldwide is it valid It 27 Per Denman C S in Hitchcock v Coker 6 A  E 438 28 French v Parker i6 R 1 2I9 I4 Atl 870 29 If the complainant here wished to retire from his practice and sell it he could probably sell it for more if he would secure the purchaser from competition with the defendant forever than he could if he could only secure him from such competition during his own life So if he wished to take in a partner he could for the same reason make better terms with him 29 Hitchcock v Coker 6

area of a foreign country that fact could not be an argument against the validity of the covenant3 This may be doubted for it is now apparent that restrictions upon doing business in a foreign country

If the sale be illegal32 then the restriction certainly is But if the sale taken by itself be legal the courts have made no dis tinction so far as the legality of the restriction is concerned between

United Kingdom but he contended that it ought not to be worldwide in its operation I think that in laying down the rule that a covenant in restraint of trade unlimited in regard to space was bad the courts had reference only to this country They would in my opinion in the days when the rule was adopted have scouted the notion that if for the pro tection of the vendees of a business in this country it were necessary to obtain a re strictive covenant embracing foreign countries that covenant would be bad They certainly would not have regarded it as against public policy to prevent the person whose business had been purchased and was being carried on here from setting up or assisting rival businesses in other countries and for my own part I see nothing injurious to the public interests of this country in upholding such a covenant 32 As to the principles governing the validity of the sale see Kales  Good and Bad Trusts 30 HARV L REv 830 which deals with combinations 3

and the only way in which the business could be sold was for the seller to agree not to carry it on34 Where part of a business has been sold to a competitor by merely covenanting not to carry on the part specified the sale and the restriction have been sustained35 In some cases there were special elements which furnished argu ments in favor of the validity of the sale and the restriction Thus where it appeared that the competitor who sold out had recently gone into the business for the purpose of engaging in a cutthroat competition and being bought off there was presented an actual case of excessive competition and the buyer was in the position of endeavoring to protect his legitimate and established business from the sellers unconscionable conduct36 So where it appeared that the seller was making tartar of both rock and bone and that both were of equal utility and the seller parted with his bone tartar business only and kept his rock tartar business the court noted that the public purchasing tartar still had competition as to prices between rock tartar and bone tartar37 contra Gamewell FireAlarm Co v Crane i6o Mass 50 35 N E 98 50 Carroll v Giles 30 S C 412 34 Leslie v

position to cut prices in that part of the business sold while making a profit on the other part thus practicing the scheme of local price cutting to put the buyer out of business The court speaks of the seller as being a dangerous and aggressive rival The court said The plaintiff was making inroads upon the defendants business and greatly cutting the prices of its sole manufactured product while with the plaintiff this product was but a single feature of its manufacturing plant The defendant had a perfect right to buy off the competition of a dangerous powerful and aggressive rival The law of

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS ACCOMPANYING THE COMBINATION OF SEVERAL BUSINESS UNITS If the combination be illegal38 then the restriction certainly is But if the combination taken by itself be legal the courts appear to have made no distinction so far as the validity of the restriction is concerned between the case of a sale and a combination39 The principal question which arises is whether the test of the validity of the restriction is the extent of the business sold or of the businesses combined Is the restriction void only if it is broader than the business sold or only if it is broader than the businesses combined The latter position has been sustained40 The situation is like that of an incoming partner who devotes himself to the common business of all the partners and may properly be restricted so that he cannot carry on the same business in competition with the partnership VI COVENANTS NOT TO CARRY ON A BUSINESS GIVEN BY ONE IN THE BUSINESS TO ANOTHER IN THE BUSINESS OR INTENDING TO ENTER IT It has already been assumed that a contract to refrain from doing business is void when the promisor is already engaged in the business and the promisee is not entering the business and not a competitor On the other hand some covenants not to carry on a business are valid when they are secured to enable the promisee to enter the business on more advantageous terms A common case of this sort is where a professional man having an established 38 For the principles applicable in determining the validity of combinations see Kales  Good and Bad Trusts 30 HARV L REV 839 39 Oakdale Mfg

the promisee and promisor are already in the business and competing is the covenant by one to the other to cease business valid Where the business is carried on principally with a plant and property which cannot readily be converted to any other use and will in all probability lie entirely idle during a period provided by the covenant the restriction is regularly held to be illegal41 The moment however the restrictive covenant is to take a steamboat off a certain run which does not in the least involve keeping it idle but only transferring it to another service it has been sus tained42 So where competitors agreed to cease competing by dividing the territory where their selling force operated and recip rocally covenanting not to do business in the specified territory of each other the covenants have been sustained43 So where the business was conducted without any plant at all the promise to cease business and turn over all orders to the competing promisee was held to be valid44 4

covenant with the competitor not to carry on a given business is specially objectionable where it involves the shutting down and standing idle of a valuable plant rendering the property useless for the time being A contract operating in this way presents a distinctive feature which must be considered in balancing the considerations for and against its validity This distinctive feature is decisive against the legality of the restriction even though the latter be regarded as a method of selling the business of the covenantor It may be urged that the covenantee could have purchased the property and then shut up the plant and yet the restriction by the seller must have been held valid The answer to this is that the actual purchase of the plant and property would in most cases be a guaranty that the plant would not be shut down unless there had in fact been excessive competition  in which case the shutting down would be justified Furthermore a plant which is simply shut down for a specified number of years must if the contract be valid remain shut no matter what the business conditions may be On the other hand a plant and property which are purchased outright and shut down may and undoubtedly would be opened by the owner as soon as business conditions warranted that step These considerations are sufficient to justify the courts in making a distinction between the actual sale of the plant and the shutting down of the plant without such sale45 Albert M Kales CHICAGO ILLINOIS plant in his business but where the plant was not sold the restriction was neverthe less sustained 45 In Stines v Dorman 25 Ohio St 58o D purchased of B a hotel property D also sold to B a hotel property and B covenanted not to use the premises so purchased for hotel purposes while the property which D purchased from B was so used The restriction was held valid Suppose however it had appeared that this was a mere subterfuge to secure in effect a covenant by B to shut down his hotel property and go out of the hotel business while still retaining a property useful for hotel purposes Perhaps the restriction might still have been sustained because it was probable that under it Bs property would not remain entirely useless but would be put to some other useful purpose

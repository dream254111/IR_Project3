NEW STAR IN AURIGA ON Feb 2 of the present year Professor Copeland of the Edinburgh Observatory received an anonymous postal card upon which was written the following Nora in Auriga in Milky Way about two degrees south of Chi Aurigme pre ceding 26 Auriga fifth magnitude slightly brighter than Chi In No 1164 of Nature the discoverer of the new star es tablishes his identity by a short notice of the manner in which he found the Nora His name is Thomas D Ander son and he lives in Edinburgh Scotland The following is an abbreviation of his statement It the star was visible as a star of the fifth magnitude for two or three days very probably even for a week before Professor Copeland received my postal card I am almost certain that at two oclock on the morning of Sunday Jan uary 24 I saw a fifth magnitude star making a large ob tuse angle with Beta Tauri and Chi Aurigae and I am posi tive that I saw it at least twice subsequently during that week Unfortunately I mistook it on each occasion for 26 Aurigae merely remarking to myself that 26 was a much brighter star than I used to think it It was only on the morning of Sunday the 31st of January that I satisfied my self that it was a strange body Mr Anderson then in a frank manner speaks of his knowledge of astronomy and the instrumental means at his disposal Of the former he says it is of meagrest descrip tion while the latter consist of a pocket telescope and a copy of Kleins Star Atlas Since discovery the new star has been very generally ob served at all the prominent observatories ini Europe and America The telegram announcing the discovery was re ceived at the Naval Observatory on the afternoon of February 6 I observed the star the same evening with our 4inch cometseeker To me it then appeared about half a maoni tude brighter than Chi and was of a dark straw color Using a lowpower eyepiece I could bring both Chi and the VOL XIX No 476 new star into the field at the same time With the meridian transit 1 observed the star for its Right Ascension and Pro fessor Frisby with the 9inch equatorial determined its declination The large transit circle is now dismounted undergoing repairs prior to its removal to the new Observa tory The place of the star for 18920 is RA 5 h 25 m 34 s Dec 30 21 410 The magnitude was 46 Professor Copeland upon examining the star with a prism between the eye and the eyepiece of the 24 inch reflector observed that it seemed to possess a spectrum very much like that of the Nora of 1886 the recognized variable named Tau Coronre The star was photographed at Harvard College Observa tory on Dec 1 10 and 20 two months before it was known to be a new star This came about by Prosessor Pickering and his assistants photographing the region of the sky in which the Nora is located in the course of the photographic mapping of the stars and their spectra now being carried on at Harvard College Observatory On the 1st of December 1891 the Nora was faint on December 10 bright and on the 20th maximum Spectrum unique The above is a statement given out by Professor Pickering From No 3076 of the Astronomische Nachrichten we glean the following interesting points relative to the new star At Bonn Feb 2 Professor Kustner made a careful comparison of the magnitude of the Nora with three neigh boring stars He estimated it as half a magnitude fainter than Chi little if any brighter than 14 Aurigre and de cidedly brighter than 26 Aurigae the resulting magnitude being 55 The region of the sky in which the new star is located was examined for the Bonn Durchmusterung by Schonfeld March 26 1856 and Kreuger Feb 16 1857 also again by Kreuger in the revisionzone March 23 1858 on which date he ob served a star of the 95 magnitude distant from the place of the new star 25s and 08 This faint star has however been observed anew at Bonn and Hamburg At Upsala on Feb 2 its magnitude was estimated as 55 and its color as yellow On observing its spectrum a very bright line was seen at the red end and another in the blue green On Feb 3 the star was almost as bright as Chi but the next night it was fainter At Kiel Mr Kroeger observed the spectrum on Feb 2 It was brilliant and visible throughout all the colors from the red far into the violet A broad black band was seen near C In the red and orange there were three groups of lines separated by equil intervals and of nearly equal width and intensity all wide but faint Mr Yendell living near Boston and an expert in variable star observing is authority for the statement that between Feb 9 and 22 the star appeared to him ot a bluish white color with no tinge of red This observation of the color of the star is directly opposite to that reported by the English and German observers and also that of mine made on several oc casions The star has each time that I have observed it ten or twelve times always appeared to me of a dark straw color I have observed it with two instruments the 4 inch comet seeker and the meridian transit Mr Lockyer the English spectroscopist has secared several photographs of the spec trum He estimated the color of the star as reddish with a purple tinge Mr Fowler one of his assistants estimates it as reddish yellow while another Mr Baxaudall estimates it as purplish Mr Lockyer commenting upon the photographs taken on Feb 7 says The bright lines K H h and G are accomSCIENCE paniedby dark lines on their more refrangible sides With the 10inch refractor and Maclean spectroscope C was seen to be very brilliant and there were four very conspicuous lines in the green Several fainter lines were also seen and a dark line was suspected in the orange Mr Lockyer noticed that some of the lines especially the bright ones near F on the less refrangible side appeared to change rapidly in rela tive brightness and this was confirmed by Mr Fowler All the lines in the spectrum of the Nora are broad although in a photograph of the spectrum of Arcturus taken with the same instrumental conditions the lines were perfectly sharp It is also important to note that the broadening of the lines is not accompanied by any falling off of intensity at the edges as in the case of the hydrogen lines in such a star as Sirius Judging from the testimony here given it is undoubtedly true that a new star lias appeared to our vision and given astronomers an opportunity to study its makeup It cannot however be said that the object has suddenly come out to its present magnitude The probability points to the fact that the new star is a variable of long period and one that at its minimum sinks to invisibility The verification of this statement must rest upon future observations We have no record that indicates that a star as bright as the tenth mag nitude has ever occupied the place in which the new star has been found All speculation as to its future history is value less because we know nothing of its past history The star is now being constantly watched by all the pow erful telescopes and spectroscopes 9f the world its image is almost nightly caught upon the photographic plate handled by men of experience and it will not sink back into invisi bility without leaving behind a record of great value GEO A HILL Washington DC March 9 THE TIMBER TREES OF WEST VIRGINIA THE Guyandot Coal Land Association which is the owner of over 200000 acres of land in the basins of the Guyandot and TwelvePole Rivers in the Counties of Wayne Logan and Lincoln near the southwest corner of West Virginia has recently had the large timber trees on about 9000 acres of land counted and measured thus securing reliable infor mation as to the actual present condition of the Transappa lachian forests of thlat region The diameter of the trees was taken with calipers at about four feet above the ground then the length of the trunks suitable for cutting into logs or for long timber was carefully estimated by the eye of the skilful timber measurer No trees were measured that were less than eighteen inches in diameter except the hickories and locusts which were measured from ten inches and up ward The detailed tables of this counting and measuring have been furnished me for inspection I think that a sum mary of the detailed count of the results of the measure ments on one single tract will be of interest to the readers of Science For this purpose I select a tract of 655 acres on the top of the dividing ridge between the waters of the east and the west forks of TwelvePole River two miles north east of the new mining town of Dunlow on the Ohio exten sion of the Norfolk and Western Railroad about forty miles by rail southeast from the Ohio River at the new town of Kenova one named from the abbreviation names of the three States that are there adjacent About onehalf of this particular tract of land say 325 acres lies on the east side of the dividing ridge slopes from the divide and faces to the north of east and drains into East TwelvePole River The other 325 acres lies on the west side of the divide slopes to the south of west and drains into West TwelvePole River The crest of the divide is not far from 1000 feet above the level of the sea The following statement shows the whole humber of large timber trees now growing on this tract of 655 acres by kinds and exposures This tract was found to have growing on it 16989 trees an average of about 26 large timber trees to the acre Trees of Each Kinds of Trees Western Slope Eastern Slope Kind White oaks  1256 730 1986 Chestnut oaks  3803 2083 5886 Black oaks  734 366 1100 Red oaks 494 242 736 Hickories  1556 991 2547 Chestnuts  1203 697 1900 Locusts 148 59 207 Maples  224 6 330 Birches 159 174 333 Tulippoplars  386 472 858 Pines 563 376 939 Lindens 93 74 167 Totals 10619 6370 16989 The proportionate percentage of the hardwood trees of the above table all those named except the tulippoplars pines and lindens is quite remarkable The softwood trees are 1042 on the westward slope and 922 on the eastward slope a total of 1964 or less than ten per cent of the whole number of trees on the western slope over fourteen per cent of those on the eastern slope and nearly twelve per cent of the whole number of trees leaving over ninety per cent of the wvest ward slope trees and near eightysix per cent of the eastward slope ones as hardwoods So these hardwood trees constitute eightynine per cent of all the large counted and measured trees now growing on this tract of land The figures of the table indicate that the large hardwood trees are more abun dant on the westward exposure of the dividing ridge The record of the diameter and length of each of the trees embraced in the above list that now lies before me shows that most of these trees are of large size the oaks ranging in diameter from eighteen to sixty inches and in trunk length from twenty to sixty feet The hickories range from ten to twentyseven inches in diameter and from fifteen to sixty feet in trunk length the pines from eighteen to forty inches in diameter and twenty to seventy feet in trunk length and the tulippoplars from twenty to sixtysix inches in diameter and from thirty to eighty feet in trunk length JED HOTCHKISS Staunton Va THE SPECIALIST MANY scientific men of excellent reputation are today guilty of the crime of unnecessary and often premeditated and deliberately planned mystification

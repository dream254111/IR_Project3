sick as a result of eating unwholesome food at defendants restaurant She brought an action alleging that there was a sale of the food to her and a breach of an implied warranty of quality Held that a restaurant keeper does not sell his food Merrill v Hodson Conn I914 gi Atl 533 The action was brought under the SAILE OF GooDs ACT of Connecticut which provides that in all sales of goods there is an implied warranty that the goods shall be fit for the purpose for which they are ordered Was there a sale of the food to the plaintiff PRENTICE C J said The customer does not become the owner of the food set before him    No designated portion becomes his He is privileged to eat and that is all The uneaten food is not his He cannot do what he pleases with it    Before the consumption title does not pass after consumption there remains nothing to become the subject of title What the customer pays for is the right to satisfy his appetite by the process of destruction citing Saunderson v Rowles 4 Burrows 2064 Crisp v Pratt 3 Cro Car 549 Parker v Flint 12 Mod 254 Newton v Trigg 3 Mod 327 and Harmon v Clarkson 22 Upp Can C P 29I all of which hold that an innkeeper is not a trader subject to bankruptcy as he does not sell the food supplied to his guests but merely alters it In many modern cases it has been held that the supplying of liquor by restaurant keepers and boarding house keepers to their guests or boarders as a part of their meals is a sale of liquor to such per sons State v Lotti 72 Vt 115 Savage v State 50 Tex Crim Rep I99 State v Wenzel 72 N H 396 Scanlon v Denver 38 Colo 40 Nicrosi v State 52 Ala 336 Laner v District of Columbia ii App D C 453 Reasoning from analogy it would seem that if the title to or property in the liquor passed to the guest or boarder the food which is served under the same circumstances and for the same purposes would become the property of the guest or boarder and there would be a complete sale But in cases tried under liquor laws the courts very often disregard the technical meaning of the word sale and choose to carry out the presumed intention of the legislature by sustaining convictions on evidence of any transfer of the prohibited commodity for value They have gone so far as to include barters exchanges gifts and the payment of hire or wages in liquor as sales Commonwealth v Abrams I50 Mass 393 Commonwealth v Clark

UNDISCLOSED PRINCIPAL A buyer of asphalt blocks as agent for the plaintiff though he did not dis close his agency made no representation to the defendant that he was dealing with it as principal In an action by the principal for the breach of an implied warranty the defendant pleaded that the identity of the prin cipal was concealed because of the principals belief that if it were disclosed the sale would not be made It appears that the plaintiff and defendant were competitors The defendant further pleaded that if it had known the plainMICHIGAN LAWREVIEW tiff was principal it would have refused to make the sale Held not a defense to an action by principal for breach of an implied warranty Kelly Asphalt Block Co v Barber Asphalt Paving Co NY 1914 I05 N E 88 VWhere the agent as ostensible principal makes a contract not under seal in his own name the real principal may sue thereon Winchester v Howard 97 Mass 303 Darling v Noyes 32 Iowa 96 Henderson Hull  Co v McNally I68 N Y 646 There are certain exceptions to this rule however first where exclusive credit is given to the agent Cowan v Curran 216 Ill 598 Kelly v Thuey I02 Mo 522 but the making of an ordinary business contract without in some way indicating that the per sonality of the other party is regarded as material implies consent that it may be enforced by a third person if it was made in his behalf Hawkins v Windhorst 87 Kans I76 I23 Pac 76I secondly where there is an executory contract the third party on discovering who the real principal is may repudiate the contract and does not have to submit his reasons to the court for so doing this on the grounds of the established rule in contracts that a party has a right to select and determine with whom he will contract and cannot have another thrust

Low A century of constitutional government in the United States has served to emphasize the wisdom of Hamiltons warning of the tendency of the legislative authority to absorb every other He clearly foresaw and attempted to guard against dangers that today are only too appar ent In governments purely republican he wrote this tendency is almost irresistible The representa tives of the people in a popular assembly seem sometimes to fancy that they are the people themselves and betray strong symptoms of impatience and disgust at the least sign of opposition from any other quarter as if the exer cise of its rights by either the executive or the judiciary were a breach of their privilege and an outrage to their dignity They often appear disposed to exert an imperi ous control over the other departments and as they commonly have the people on their side they always act with such momentum as to make it very difficult for the other members of the government to maintain the balance of the Constitution  The Federalist No 702 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW Never did human ingenuity devise a more nicely balanced system of government than when the framers of the Constitution allocated to the executive and to the legislature the exercise of powers not to be infringed by the other but like many things human the intent has been perverted Every person familiar with the Consti tution the debates in the convention and the writings of Madison Hamilton and Jay in The Federalist must know that the purpose of the framers of the Constitution was to create a system of government by which the President should become neither the creature nor the controller of the legislature and by vesting certain exclusive powers in the popular branch and certain other powers in the Senate to provide that the line of demarcation between the two houses should not be overstepped What they feared and believed they had effectually guarded against was an executive who would become possessed of auto cratic powers what they dreaded no less was a legisla ture that would reduce the President merely to a pup peta puppet to dance when Congress pulled the strings Monarchial Europe and the Roman republics had warned them of the danger to the liberties of the people when the king was the source of all power or when in a republic that power was usurped by a council or other elected body supposed to safeguard the people against the encroachments of the executive In making this exact and definite division of power the framers of the Constitution had a distinct purpose in view The legislature was to act as a check upon the executive the restraining influence of one branch of the legislature was to be exercised upon the other Modeled upon the House of Commons the House of Rep resentatives was given control over expenditures and itTHE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 3 is that control that really constitutes the power of a legislature in a constitutional form of government The right of the House of Representatives to originate  money bills led to prolonged discussion in the constitutional convention There was a marked disposition shown by many of the delegates to make the Senate a negligible quantity so far as bills raising revenue were concerned by prohibiting the right of amendment the functions of the Senate in this respect to be analogous to the House of Lords which may neither increase nor diminish a reve nue bill sent to them by the Commons But in granting that power to the Senate it is interesting to note in view of what I believe is foreign to the spirit of the Constitu tion and the intent of its framers the exercise of usurped powers by the Senate In the constitutional convention Mason of Virginia addressing himself to the powers of the two houses relating to revenue bills and the right of the Senate to amend used this language By authorizing amendments in the Senate it got rid of the objections that the Senate could not correct errors of any sort and that it would introduce into the House of Representatives the practice of tacking foreign matter to money bills These objections being removed the arguments in favor of the proposed restraint on the Senate ought to have full force The Senate did not represent the people but the States in their political character It was improper therefore that it should tax the people Again the Senate is not like the House of Rep resentatives chosen frequently and obliged to return fre quently among the people They are to be chosen by the States for six years will probably settle themselves at the seat of government will pursue schemes for their own aggrandizementwill be able by wearying out the4 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW House of Representatives and taking advantage of their impatience at the close of a long session to extort measures for that purpose     A bare negative was a very different thing from that of originating bills The practice of England was in point The House of Lords does not represent nor tax the people because not elected by the people If the Senate can originate they will in the recess of the legislative sessions hatch their mis chievous projects for their own purposes and have their money bills ready cut and dried to use a common phrase for the meeting of the House of Representatives Here very concisely the fundamental question has been stated The House represented the people the Senate did not Taxation was a prerogative to be exer cised by the people The makers of the Constitution feared executive as well as judicial usurpation They erected barriers to protect themselves For that reason the treaty making power was divided between the execu tive and the Senate and the argument used in support of that division of power was that  a man raised from the station of a private citizen to the rank of chief magistrate possessed of a moderate or slender fortune and looking forward to a period not very remote when he may prob ably be obliged to return to the station from which he was takenmight sometimes be under temptations to sacrifice his duty to his interest which it would require superlative virtue to withstand And note again Hamil tons warning against placing too great power in the hands of the President The history of human con duct  he says  does not warrant that exalted opinion of human virtue which would make it wise in a nation to Documentary History of the Constitution of the United States of America vol iii p 514THE USURPED POWER OF THE SENATE 5 commit interests of so delicate and momentous a kind as those which concern its intercourse with the rest of the world to the sole disposal of a magistrate created and circumstanced as would be a President of the United States a The same distrust of the judiciary was expressed with equal frankness It was proposed in the constitutional convention that the power to confirm appointments should be vested in the Supreme Court but the suggestion was negatived as it was feared that the Supreme Court would be too readily susceptible to the influence of the President owing to the members of the court being his appointees That the Senate would attempt to dictate appointments that it would demand of the President that certain men should be appointed to office or failing this that other men would not be confirmed was so repugnant to the spirit of the Constitution that its framers refused to entertain it as a contingency to be guarded against This inter ference with the President in the free exercise of the appointing power is another of the usurped powers of the Senate dangerous to the people and a curtailment of the rights of the executive Entertaining a distrust of the President and the judi ciary it was to the legislature that the framers of the Constitution looked to preserve those rights and liberties for which they had paid with their blood But here again they saw the danger that might follow from the centralization of power in a small and cohesive body such as the Senate The example of England and the teach ings of history had convinced them that a bicameral legislature was necessary and although there was pro nounced opposition to the creation of a second chamber The Federalist No 756 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW and much fear was expressed that the Senate would oppress the House of Representatives the argument that history informs us of no long lived republic which had not a Senate prevailed and the restrictions thrown around the Senate were considered strong enough to nullify any danger It was to the House of Represen tatives that these men really pinned their faith Its members were to be elected at short intervals they came direct from the people they represented the people they were of the people If they committed treason it was treason against themselves If they were tyrannous they would suffer from their own tyranny If through weak ness or selfinterest they bartered their own liberties they would pay the penalty Surely this was confidence not misplaced And above all they commanded the ex chequer They in a word hold the purse Hamilton said of the House Against this power kings and oli garchs have contended in vain The purse is more potent than the sword for it is only when the purse is opened that the sword is unsheathed I have thus briefly sketched what my study of the Con stitution has taught me was the intent of its framers and I now propose to show how this intent has been perverted But before doing so let me summarize the broad principles of the Constitution It was contemplated that there should be First an executive untrammeled by the legislature in the exercise of his constitutional rights Second a Senate which should supervise the executive so as to prevent the appointment of improper or unfit persons to public office or the making of treaties detri mental to national interests and which should have co6r dinate powers with those of the House of Representatives except in legislation affecting money bills Third aTHE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 7 House of Representatives that should have control over the national purse How far have the American people departed in principle from the scheme of their Fathers Perhaps the most important divergence which is almost the most dangerous to the rights and liberties of the people and to the future of the republic is the right arrogated by the Senate which I regret to say has been ratified by the Supreme Court to control the purse which in its broader sense means not only the right to make appropriations but the higher privilege to impose taxation The Constitution provides that all bills raising revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives but the Senate has power to amend these bills By this power of amendment the Senate has defeated the purpose of the Constitution which was to retain the taxing power in the hands of the representatives of the people The tariff which is the great source of revenue is no longer the creation of the House The House passes a tariff bill which the Senate proceeds to  amend  in accordance with its own views or the special interests represented by particular Senators Surely when the Senate strikes out of a tariff bill passed by the House everything except the enacting clause writes in a new bill and returns it to the House with an ultimatum that the House must either accept the Senate amendment or no tariff bill will be passed it is obvious that that particular bill has origi nated in the Senate even though the constitutional form has been observed because its origin can be traced to the House When we turn to the consideration of amendments made by the Senate to  money  or as we now term them appropriation bills they are so numerous that it is impossible to catalogue them As a matter of practice8 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW appropriation bills are almost invariably initiated by the House but the Senate regards the House bill not as a finality but as a project to use the word applied by a Senator to describe a treaty sent to the Senate for ratification In other words the bill passed by the House is a scheme expressing the views of the House in regard to the disbursement of the public moneys but of no more binding force than a recommendation made by the head of a department It is notorious that the Senate almost invariably increases the appropriations made by the House it is equally notorious that in any contest between the House and the Senate it is the House that nine times out of ten has to yield to the Senate The reason for this can be easily explained The legislative surrender of the House of Representa tives to the Senate began with the election of Mr Reed to the speakership of the FiftyFirst Congress Mr Reed found himself confronted with a state of affairs that demanded a drastic remedy The majority because of the adoption of foolish rules was at the mercy of the minority Practically business could only be trans acted by unanimous consent or the test of endurance The House could be rendered impotent by the opposition offering dilatory motions which under the rules must be voted on to the exclusion of legitimate business or by breaking a quorum When Mr Reed came to the chair he had vivid recollections of the bitter contest over the Direct Tax Bill when for twentysix consecutive hours members sat behind locked doors while a call of the House was in progress and the SergeantatArms and his depu ties were scouring Washington to bring members under arrest to the bar of the House Mr Reed resolved very properly that the majorityTHE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 9 being responsible for legislation should have the power to legislate He framed a code of rules and parenthetic ally it is interesting to add that the code framed sixteen years ago is virtually the code of today that centralized all power in the hands of the Speaker and deprived the  private member  of all power Mr Reed aimed at two things to enable the House to transact business instead of wasting its time in mere idle talk to check the rising tide of extravagance that threatened to swamp the treasury When the House had adopted these rules it was within the power of the Speaker to regulate to the fraction of a second the exact time to be allotted to the considera tion of any measure to permit a measure to be considered or to prevent its consideration No man entertains higher appreciation for Mr Reed than I His lofty ideals his great reforms and the cour ageous example he has set the country entitle him to the profound gratitude of the American people And yet I am forced reluctantly to admit that Mr Reeds rules had unfortunate consequences albeit they were conse quences that Mr Reed could not foresee In his desire to prevent time from being frittered away it often happened that even vital measures were disposed of without proper consideration When the time set for taking a vote arrived the gavel fell often in the midst of a sentence and all debate ceased And because of the Speakers rigid ideas of economy members who were unable to secure appropriations induced Senators to offer these bills in the Senate in the form of amendments The rules of the Senate are radically different from those of the House In the Senate there is no limitation of debate So long as the physical endurance of a Senator lasts so long may he speak and by an unwritten but10 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW strictly observed rule the Senator who is weary may defer the conclusion of his speech until such time as he shall have sufficiently recuperated Like the mysterious East the Senate cannot be hurried It is this freedom of debate that makes the individual Senator so all powerful which is in such marked contrast to the individual Rep sentative who has no individual power Senators do not scruple about the exercise of this power The late Sena tor Quay threatened to defeat a tariff bill unless certain changes were made that he demanded He came to the Senate with a speech that would have required weeks in its delivery The Senate was compelled to make peace with Mr Quay on his own terms Senator Carter of Montana kept 70000000 in the treasury by talking a river and harbor bill to death Because of this enormous individual senatorial power business in the Senate nowadays practically can only pro ceed by unanimous consent which bluntly stated means that every Senator must be paid his legislative price I use the term without any sinister meaning No Senator is so foolish as to antagonize a brother Senator because at an inconvenient moment that Senator might use his power And that is the reason why members of the House secure appropriations by the roundabout way of the Senate instead of directly through the House and it explains the statement previously made that appropria tion bills as a rule are increased by the Senate It is perhaps almost unnecessary to add that Senators are only too glad to be of service to members of the House as it places members under obligations to them and forces their constituents to realize that the real fountain of power in Washington is the Senator which strengthens the hold of the Senator upon his StateTHE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 11 We have seen that the Senate has usurped legislative powers that the Constitution did not originally contem plate it should possess and by that usurpation the impor tanee and dignity of the House of Representatives has been correspondingly decreased It no longer controls the purse but has been forced to share that control with the Senate We have now to ascertain whether the Senate has in a similar manner encroached upon the prerogatives of the executive Executive usurpation has been a favorite theme of writers and speakers especially during the last few years who relying upon their rhetoric rather than their facts have deplored the growing power of the executive and longed for a return to the early days when the President respected the powers vested in the legislature But as a matter of fact if there has been usurpation that of the President is trivial compared to that of the Senate In the exercise of the two most important functions reposed in the executive the conduct of foreign relations and the power of appointment the purpose contemplated by the framers of the Constitution has been so thoroughly per verted by the usurpation of the Senate that the original relation existing between the President and the Senate has been reversed In dividing the responsibility for appointments between the President and the Senate that is in making the presidential appointment subject to confirmation by the Senate it was intended to put in the hands of the Senate the power to prevent the President from making an improper appointment but it was not intended that the Senate should be able to dictate the Presidents nominees That possible assumption was scouted as preposterous  It will be the office of the President Hamilton wrote12 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW to nominate and with the advice and consent of the Senate to appoint There will of course mark the words be no exertion of choice on the part of the Senate They may defeat one choice of the executive and oblige him to make another but they cannot themselves choosethey can only ratify or reject the choice of the President They might even entertain a preference to some other person at the very moment they were assent ing to the one proposed because there might be no posi tive ground of opposition to him and they could be sure if they withheld their assent that the subsequent nomina tion would fall upon their own favorite or upon any other person in their estimation more meritorious than the one rejected Thus it could hardly happen that the majority of the Senate would feel any other complacency towards the object of an appointment than such as the appearances of merit might inspire and the proofs of the want of it destroy  But Hamilton wise man though he was could not anticipate a time when the courtesy of the Senate would put it in the power of a single Senator to defeat a nomination nay even more than that to coerce a Presi dent into nominating a man of whom he did not approve One has only to recall the contest between Cleveland and the Senate and that between Harrison and the Senate and to remember that McKinley as well as Roosevelt had to steer a very fine course to avoid shipwreck of their nominations to become convinced that the Hamiltonian doctrine is archaic and that that  complacency to which Hamilton referred instead of being inspired by the appearances of merit springs from selfinterest The relations between the President and the Senate are 1The Federalist No 66THE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 13 harmonious so long as the President defers to the Senate and the Senate is willing to pretend deference to the Presi dent but any assertion of independence on the part of the President is bound to lead to a clash Seeing only the results but unaware of the causes certain superficial observers are fond of saying that the President can control the Senate because of the Presidents power of patronage thus unconsciously voicing the fear of Hamilton that  sometimes we are told that this fund of corruption is to be exhausted by the President in subduing the virtue of the Senate  But the power of the President to appoint is a power exercised only by the permission of the Senate The President is not a free agent in the exercise of the appointing power Unlike the king of England he does not deal with one man the responsible head of the majority party in Commons The President must deal with ninety Senators It would be discourteous to a Senator for him to appoint a man who is personally offen sive to that particular Senator quite irrespective of the reasons that animate that Senator Virtually the Senate has now become the appointing power although to save the shadow of the Constitution appointments are still made by the President Hamilton explained why the convention deemed it wise that treaties should be ratified by the Senate The Presi dent was not to be given that absolute authority possessed by a sovereign in the negotiation of treaties that would enable the President to betray his country if he were venal but at the same time he was to be given such latitude as would insure that perfect secrecy and immediate despatch  which are sometimes  requisite  As showing the relation that Hamilton conceived would exist between the President and the Senate in the negotiation and ratifi14 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW cation of treaties he said Should any circumstances occur which require the advice and consent of the Senate he may at any time convene them Thus we see that the Constitution provides that our negotiations for treaties shall have every advantage which can be derived from talents information integrity and deliberate investi gations on the one hand and from secrecy and despatch on the other Once again we see how the spirit of the Constitution has been perverted by the assumption of the Senate The President negotiates a treaty but that treaty the Senate regards in the same light as it does an appropriation bill passed by the House It is merely a scheme a project  an outline expressing the views of the negotiators which the Senate will accept or reject at its pleasure and of recent years the Senate has shown what amounts almost to a mania to amend treaties and unless the President accepts the amendment a treaty that may have been the work of months of careful and intricate negotiations is wrecked President McKinley in his great desire to re main on harmonious terms with the Senate permitted that body a further and unconstitutional grant of authority By the terms of the treaty with Great Britain relating to the tenure and disposition of real and personal property possessions of the United States beyond the seas were to be permitted to adhere to the convention upon notice being given by the representative of the United States at London by direction of the President  This the Senate amended to read by direction of the treaty making power of the United States which gives to the Senate the right to direct the American ambassador in London for which no warrant can be found in the Con stitution The Federalist No 66THE USURPED POWERS OF THE SENATE 15 Jackson jealous of his own prerogatives and the en croachments of the Senate used this admonitory language in defining the line of division between the executive and legislative branches of the government  The resolution of the Senate presupposes a right in that body to interfere in this exercise of executive power If the principle be once admitted     the constitutional independence of the Executive Department would be as effectually destroyed and its powers as effectually transferred to the Senate as if that end had been accomplished by an amend ment to the Constitution Grant in returning to the House of Representatives a resolution directing the Secretary of State to acknowl edge a despatch of congratulation used this language  I cannot escape the conviction that their adoption had inadvertently involved the exercise of a power which infringes upon the constitutional rights of the executive The Constitution of the United States follow ing the established usages of nations has indicated the President as the agent to represent the national sover eignty in its intercourse with foreign powers and in all official communications from them The whole correspondence of the government with and from foreign states is entrusted to the President that the Secretary of State conducts such correspondence exclusively under the orders and instructions of the President and that no communication or correspondence from foreigners or from a foreign state can properly be addressed to any branch or department of the government except that to which such correspondence has been committed by the Consti tution and the laws1 The Senate now assumes the right not only to amend Richardson Messages and Papers of the President Vol VII p 43216 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW treaties so that by the power of amendment it exercises the same control over the conduct of foreign relations as it does over the national purse but also to be consulted in advance of and during the progress of treaty negotiations and if it is not consulted in advance it resents the implied imputation of presidential distrust That perfect secrecy and immediate despatch  which Hamilton deemed requisite are of course impossible if the Senate must be consulted in advance and even after the unofficial advice of the Senate has been taken Senators are not precluded from reversing their judgment The late Secretary Hay complained bitterly of certain Senators opposing a treaty in the Senate the terms of which they had acquiesced in while that treaty was under negotiation More than once I have heard Mr Hay say that in dealing with foreign governments he felt as if he had one hand tied behind his back and a ball and chain about his leg as he was always hampered by the Senate James Russell Lowell was asked by Guizot how long he thought the Republic of the United State would endure So long as the ideas of those who founded it continue dominant was Lowells reply With this observation of an acute mind which is food for serious reflection to those who would see the Republic endure I leave the subject

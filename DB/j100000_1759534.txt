indication whether he is going right or wrong This in credulous tendency will be greatly strengthened if the assistance of spiritualistic performers is called in S NEWCOMB RADIANT MATTER IN AN EDISON LAMP IN the Edison exhibit at the Electrical exhi bition was shown a phenomenon that deserves careful investigation at the hands of physicists Midway between the two wires which carry the current to the carbon filament of an ordinary incandescent lamp a third wire is inserted which terminates in a thin strip of platinum extending up midway between the branches of the loop with its faces turned towards them and ending about half an inch below the crown of the loop When the lamp was in action at its ordinary state of incandescence if a circuit was closed through a galvanometer between the insulated terminal of the platinum strip and either terminal of the carbon filament it showed a current flowing across the vacuum of the lamp between the platinum and the car bon in opposite directions according to which pole of the carbon was connected but much stronger  forty times stronger  when the platinum was connected to the positive pole of the incandescent carbon this through a gal vanometer of about twenty ohms resistance Moreover this current was increased when the current through the lamp was increased so as to heat it much beyond its normal temperature After the lamp has been in use for some time the stronger positiveplatinum current becomes weaker and finally changes direction By letting the lamp rest the experiment may be repeated The same currents were obtained through the glass when either terminal of the carbon was joined to a small piece of platinum stuck anywhere on the outside of the lamp the same effects were also obtained when the bulb was drawn out into a long tube and the connection made at its end and when this tube was packed in ice to cool it down but when the tube was bent round into a loop no current was obtained probably from the cut tingoff of rectilinear radiation from the car bon It would seem as if here were a field for extending Crookess experiments on radiation H M PAUL NCE VOL IV No 89 THE AMERICAN ORNITHOLOGISTS UNION THE second congress of the American ornitholo gists union was held in the American museum of natural history in New York Sept 30 and two fol lowing days Dr Philip Lutley Sclater Mr Howard Saunders and the Rev E P Knubley of the British ornithologists union were present and took part in the proceedings A large number of new members were elected The report of the committee on the revision of the nomenclature and classification of NorthAmerican birds was presented by Dr Elliott Coues The work of the committee had been divided Messrs Ridgway Brewster and Henshaw being charged with determin ing the status of species and subspecies while Mr Allen and Dr Coues were to formulate the canons of nomenclature and classification Dr Coues read at length the report of this last subcommittee the reading occupying about an hour and a half after which Mr Ridgway presented the report of the other subcommittee which emphatically and unanimously indorsed the employment of trinomials for the desig nation of subspecies The report of the committee on birdmigration was presented by Dr C Hart Merriam This committee had been very industrious anrd had been greatly helped by the public press so that bythe distribution of nearly six thousand circulars the committee finally secured nearly seven hundred observers in addition to the keepers of lights The observers are distrib uted as follows  Mississippi valley district Prof W W Cooke superintendent 170 NewEngland dis trict John H Sage superintendent 142 Atlantic district Dr A K Fisher superintendent 121 Middleeastern district Dr J M Wheaton super intendent 90 Quebec and the maritime provinces Montague Chamberlain superintendent 56 district of Ontario Thomas McIlwraith superintendent 38 Pacific district L Belding superintendent 30

superintendent 5  Newfoundland James P Howley superintendent returns not yet received Migrationstations now exist in every state and territory in the union excepting Delaware and Nevada The committee was fortunate in obtaining the co operation of the Department of marine and fisheries of Canada and of the Lighthouse board of the United States By this means it secured the free distribu tion of upwards of twelve hundred sets of schedules and circulars to the keepers of lighthouses light ships and beacons in the United States and British North America The returns thus far received from observers were exceedingly voluminous and of great value they were so extensive indeed that it was utterly impossi ble for the committee to elaborate them without con siderable pecuniary aid

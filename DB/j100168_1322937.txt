j100168,Harvard Law Review,1322937,The Parol Evidence Rule as Applied to Insurance Policies,i256885,THE PAROL EVIDENCE RULE AS APPLIED TO INSURANCE POLICIES  The United States Supreme Court has handed down a decision that will have a far reaching effect upon the liability of insurance companies The plaintiff brought action upon an insurance policy issued by an agent of the defendant The policy contained conditions that it should be void if other insurance existed upon the property covered by its terms and that no agent should have power to waive any condition of the policy unless such waiver were endorsed in writing upon the policy The de fence was that the property covered by the policy was in fact insured in another company at the time of the issuance of the policy The plain tiff maintained that the defendants agent who had full powers to accept risks and issue policies knew of the additional insurance when he issued the policy and should be deemed to have waived the provision The court with three judges dissenting held that the knowledge of the agent would not avoid the stipulation in the policy Assurance Co v Building Association 22 Sup Ct Rep 133 Although there is a conflict upon the point the great weight of author ity is opposed to this decision The reasoning of the principal case is that the insurance policy constitutes the contract of the parties that by its terms the limitations of the agents authority are brought home to the insured and that to sustain the plaintiffs contention would be to vary a written contract in violation of the parol evidence rule As a matter of fact however a binding insurance contract is commonly made before the policy is issued The agent of the insurer acting within tlle apparent scope of his authority agrees to assume the risk and issue the policy and the insured agrees to pay for the policy when issued The policy is merely the reduction into writing of a contract already existing and if a loss occurs before the policy is issued the insurer is liable in576 HARVARD LA W REVIEW surance Co v CoZt 20 Wall 56o It follows then that limitations upon the agents powers contained in the policy cannot affect a contract previ ously entered into by the insured without knowledge of such limitations Lzglztbody v Insurance Co 23 Wend N Y i8 Moreover if the policy is merely a reduction into written form of a valid oral contract previously made by the agent of the insurer any misdescription of the terms of that contract whether occurring through the mistake or fraud of the agent will be rectified by a court of equity and the insured may then recover upon the policy as amended Barnes v Insurance Co 75 Ia II Most of the courts however have gone further and in cases like that under con sideration have allowed the insured to recover in an action at law upon the policy holding the insurer estopped to set up in defence the stipula tion avoiding liability Robbins v Jnsitrance Co I49 N Y 477 The theory upon which an estoppel is raised would seem to be that the insurer through its agent has represented to the insured that the policy embodies their oral contract and the insured relying upon that representation has paid his premium This view raises the question whether the insured is justified in relying upon such a representation a question admitting of a difference of opinion The numerous and complicated provisions of such policies the inexperience of the insured with legal forms and the gen eral custom to lay aside such papers without careful perusal present an argument in support of the doctrine On the other hand the danger of abuse and fraud and the prevalence of statutory forms of policies would tend towards the stricter rule holding the insured to constructive knowledge of the contents of these documents and compelling him to first seek their reformation if he desires to escape their provisions WAlhile the latter view would support the conclusion of the court in the principal case it is unfortunately not suggested Tlhe force of the reasoning is weakened by the failure to distinguish between the policy as the con tract of insurance and as evidence of that contract and between the rights of the insured before and after knowledge of the limitations upon the powers of the insurers agent has been brought home to him

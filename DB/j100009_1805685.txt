BEGINNINGS 19151917 I In the latter part of 1915 the State Market Director of Cali fornia entered upon his activities aiming to lessen the cost of marketing and to control the prices of certain food commodities While the beginnings of this experiment are remarkable they have been attained under unusually favoring conditions It is as yet impossible to say how permanent the results are likely to be Existing Market Conditions It will be necessary in order to make the situation clear to ex plain in some detail the existing marketing conditions Although this may seem a diversion it is of itself worth while for there are features that illustrate in a striking way certain fundamental economic principles and that stand out clear of the complications under which they are usually found elsewhere Thus far the market directors activities have been confined to food products With the exception of olives he does not deal with canned food products such as canned fruits vegetables and fish he does not deal with cereals unless rice may be considered a cereal and that has come under his purview mainly because it is a new culture and lacks facilities for milling and grading nor does he include the wine industry and he is but just beginning to take up the great bean crop and beet sugar Among the food products with which the director is concerned there are several groups The first is composed of the citrus fruits the fresh and dried deciduous fruit and grapes vegetables also raisins For this group his activities have been mainly to promote cooperative associations among the growers in order to better the conditions of marketing these products outside of the state Another group is composed of dairy products eggs and poultry and concerns primarily the local markets Here too cooperation is the method adopted The third is hardly a group for it concerns only fresh fish for the local markets But in this case the director fixes the legal prices maximum prices for the fisherman wholesaler and retailer2 Carl C Plehn March The Problem If out of every dollar that the consumer pays for California dried peaches the grower receives only 15 cents the other 85 cents going to the packer the commission merchant the whole saler the retailer and the railroads is or is not the question of the possibility of reducing that 85 cents and increasing the 15 cents a public question in the sense that it justifies government intervention When this division of the consumers dollar gives the grower only 212 cents a pound for his fruit and his expenses run from 4 to 6 cents a pound for orchard care alone the grower is moved to demand help wherever he can find it and will naturally answer the question in the affirmative This illustration which is only one of many will serve to suggest the origin of the State Market Commission of California The problem of reducing the hiigh cost of marketing Californias farfamed fruits has received earnesL study for many years Of the history of the marketing of fruits Dr Lloyd says In the early 80s while the supply of California fruit was yet small it was usually purchased outright from the grower by speculative buy ers who shipped it to a few of the larger markets California fruit in the eastern markets was then looked upon as a luxury to be indulged in only by the wealthy and the limited shipments were sold at exorbitant prices During this period the buyers paid good prices to the growers and at the same time made large profits for themselves Within a few years however with increased production the markets seemed to be easily oversupplied and the former buyers refused to purchase fruit from the growers but were willling to handle it upon a commission basis in addition to a fixed charge for packing This arrangement re lieved the shipper of all risk and insured him a profit but placed the growers at the mercy of an uncertain market and finally resulted in such low returns that the entire fruit industry of the state was threat ened with ruin The crisis was reached during the financial panic of 1893 For a few years previous to that date various efforts had been made by the growers to devise some better method of marketing their products and in a few places small local associations had been organ ized The movement favoring the formation of fruit growers coopera tive marketing organizations became quite general in 1893 and was especially pronounced among orange growers in the southern part of the State The various local organizations of orange growers became affiliated and in 1895 a central organization known as the Southern California Fruit Exchange was incorporated This organization has been in continuous activity since that date though in 1905 the name was changed to California Fruit Growers Exchange and furnishes the facilities by means of which a large part of Californias citrus fruit crop is marketed I Cooperation and Other Organized Methods of Marketing Californias Horti1918 The State Market Commission of California S Until 1915 government aid to agriculture in California was con fined primarily to furthering the solution of the mechanical physical and other problems of production to education and to the dissemination of information or to research relative to soils seed varieties and the like The only aid to marketing to the commercial side of agriculture was the establishment of state and district fairs Efforts to solve the marketing problems were made solely by private initiative But in 1915 the state govern ment took a hand The states experiment is of course very young and as the rate of infantile mortality among the private experiments looking to the same end has been very high there is as yet no assurance of long life for this infant Stated briefly the aim of the states experiment is to gain the advantages and economies of combination while avoiding the dangers of monopoly The method except for group three fish is the establishment of cooperative marketing combinations under government patronage but without enforced control The gov ernment acts as mentor The commissioner is presumed to repre sent the public at large Admittedly he represents the Cali fornia public which is composed largely of growers If there be any harmony of interest between the growers and the con sumers he should represent that point of view He has no power to enforce his advice save as the withdrawal of his countenance may serve as a penalty But at the same time as his countenance leads to inspection and grading and to the endorsement of brands or trade names it has a solid commercial value and is not likely to be lightly ignored The High Cost of Marketing2 The reasons for the high cost of marketing Californias horti cultural products must be briefly explained before the efforts of the market director can be understood There are three main groups cultural Products by Dr J W Lloyd A thesis as yet unpublished pre sented by Dr Lloyd in part fulfilment of the requirement for the degree of PhD at the University of California Many of the facts used in this article are taken in part from memory from various reports and theses presented by the authors pupils during the last twenty years Since this article is not primarily an historical study detailed scholastic references seem unnecessary 2 Many details may be omitted in view of the excellent discussions already in print See Huebner Agricultural Commerce p 250 ff One correction4 Carl C Plehn March of causes all closely interwoven Some lie in the nature of the products others arise from the geographical isolation of the state and still others are to be found in the peculiarities of the demand in the distant markets The products primarily involved with roughly approximate amounts shipped from the state annually are Citrus fruits    50000 carloads Fresh deciduous fruits apples apricots cherries peaches pears plums grapes   18000  Fresh vegetables very many sorts the amount shipped is far less than the whole crop 250000 tons Dried fruits and raisins   250000  Canned fruits indirectly involved   5000000 cases Canned vegetables indirectly involved  3000000  Nuts  15000 tons Olives  1800000 gallons Olive oil  1000000  These horticultural and vegetable products have many charac teristics of an economic kind in common But the characteristics differ in importance in each case 1 They are grown both by large and by small growers But the small growers are more numerous and generally speaking the number and size of large ranches is slowly decreasing 2 Up to the point of the ripening of the fruit the industry obeys the law of diminishing returns That is to say the small ranch 40 to 100 acres intensively cultivated by or under the eye of the owner produces generally more cheaply per unit of product than a large one Or at least the costs reckoned against the crop including the owners work are not rated so high as on the large ranch 3 After the fruit is ripe the processes of picking and pack ing a term used loosely to cover curing boxing canning in short every step from tree to car and all the processes of ship ping and selling involve in a marked degree the law of increasing returns That is to say they can all be done more cheaply per unit on a large scale This may not be universally true of picking The small grower who picks his own fruit or uses should be made to his statement and that is that when the orchard fruit is sold as a whole the California practice is to sell at so much a ton or other measure Buyers here do not ordinarily pay a lump sum for the crop See also the other references given by Huebner and Dr Lloyds thesis above re ferred to which will be published soon1918 The State Market Commission of California 5 little hired labor relying on his family may reckon a smaller money cost But that largely depends on how he rates his own labor Still care and painstaking at this point count When labor is scarce the large ranch is at a disadvantage as was strik ingly shown in the season of 1917 when much fruit rotted on the ground for lack of labor to harvest it In this year of high prices and scanty food supply it was a great calamity Obviously com bination in all these processes tends to result in real saving 4 In varying degrees the products are perishable some highly so The fresh fruits go to market in refrigerator cars are pre cooled and must be iced en route They must travel fast They must be sold soon after their arrival All this not only involves costly physical appliances but the even more important necessity for avoiding gluts in any of the markets From these four causes the growers and especially the small growers who form the larger group are at a disadvantage Some way of assembling the crops in large shipments is a necessity for economy For this as well as other reaisons packersinclud ing not only those doing the things above mentioned but still more loosely commission houses j obbers and middlemen generally have performed an essential service The term packer will from here on in conformity with local usage be used to designate all those commercial agencies for packing and marketing fruit not run by the growers themselves As against the packers stand the growers associations mostly co6perative There are a few large growers who market their crops directly The unavoidable expenses of packing are large For some crops packing involves a plant of considerable size and calls for an investment of capital that the small grower can ill afford A pack ing house large enough to do the work at all can usually do a relatively large amount more than a small grower offers The larger the packing house the greater the advantage A large pack ing house can just by being large secure a larger and steadier supply of labor Its brands tradenames cans and other devices for securing reputation and goodwill become more widely known Some capital is also needed to finance the selling and a large house can hire fulltime salesmen It is claimed that California ships nearly one fourth of all the fruit that enters into the general markets of the United States The exact proportions are not very important for our present purpose But as California has only about 3 per cent of the6 Carl C Plehn March population of the United States and as a large part of that 3 per cent supplies itself with fruit without entering the general market it is obvious that the fruit must practically all be sold outside the state Now in this case outside the state means at great distances The nearest market centers of any size are on the Denver meridian 1000 miles away the next line of them is on the Chicago meridian some 2000 miles away Then comes the Atlantic coast with the most important markets some 3000 miles away There are for eign markets still more distant From this simple fact arises many a difficulty The small grower can rarely and then only at almost prohibitive cost come into personal contact with the distant dealers Even a large packer is at the mercy of outsiders for information This is often fatal as a single carload missent may cause a glut and heavy loss Although the transportation difficulties have been fairly solved there still remains unavoidably the differential in freight rates between carload and less than carload lots which establishes an ever increasing advantage for the large shipper California fruits have of course certain unique advantages in the eastern markets If it were not so they would not be there Many come in at the off seasons for the eastern fruits early cher ries for example Some are grown only in California ripe olives for example Some have a large demand for festal occasions when expense is not counted closely for example oranges raisins and nuts at Thanksgiving and Christmas But accompanying these advantages are difficulties other than those of distance It has been found for example in citrus fruits that it is the long market not the highpriced short market that pays the best A single small shipper or even a number of isolated shippers not working in har mony obviously cannot build up and hold a long market It pays better in the long run to supply a dozen small towns regularly and as directly as possible than to trust to the dealers in large centers to distribute the fruit In passing it is important to note that much of the deciduous fruit is sold at auction in large lots carload lots in the eastern centers That being the case the proper timing of shipments is vital The possibility of transferring the auction sales points to California is one of the problems The foregoing is perhaps sufficient to show the bulwarks behind which the middlemen are entrenched Rightly or wrongly the grower generally feels that he is quite at the mercy of the packers1918 The State Market Commission of California 7 The packer charges extortionate prices for packing sells the fruit and sends back to the grower whatever he pleases is a common statement Remedies for High Cost of Marketing What remedies are possible First one naturally considers competition Competition between the packers is however obvi ously no remedy for as has been seen a large part of the trouble is unco6rdinated shipping The middlemen tend to act in concert to combine to grow larger to form great corporations for as has been shown it is cheaper to do these things on a large than on a small scale An example of concerted action is found in the Cali fornia Fruit Distributors of Sacramento which ships about two thirds of the deciduous fruits fresh This is an association of commercial packers some fifteen in number with one man in charge of the routing timing and destination of shipments Second there are the exchanges or organizations through which the growers while retaining very nearly full independence collect and disseininate information These have been in some instances successful In the case of raisins whichl of course are not so very perishable there was a strong exchange formed after inany efforts at more closely bound co6perative associations had failed Third the only durable and farreaching success so far has been attained by cooperative associations The most successful one may serve as an illustration It is the one already mentioned in the citrus fruits of southern California This organization is now twentytwo years old and claims to have marketed in 191617 69 per cent of the entire crop The greater part of the remainder comes from the northerin districts The details of its organization are given in the articles to whlicll reference was made above All we are interested in here is how it does its marketing It performs for its members the followinig services 1 It packs the fruit in boxes which it has itself provided and puts it on the cars It has at times performed this service for as little as 24 cents a box but 27 to 28 cents is a fair result Packing by the commercial packers is charged at about 40 cents a box 2 It attends to freight and icing charges to routing claims for losses etc By concentrating this work it miakes many savings 3 It directs sales through sal aried representatives in the eastern markets some 77 in number It has cut the cost of marketing from 10 per cent the traditional commission to about 4 per cent 4 It has saved loss and dam8 Carl C Plehn March ages by preventing gluts 5 It has lengthened the marketing period and has spread the sales out from the large centers to many small towns and even villages 6 It has increased the demand For example between 1900 and 1910 the population of the United States increased 21 per cent but 292 per cent more oranges were eaten 7 It inspects and grades the fruit and en deavors to maintain a high reputation 8 By pooling it spreads the losses as well as the gains over all its members The organization has been so runs the general opinion well ad ministered But on examination it appears that in so far as it has any advantage over an equally large and equally well administered equally honest private profit purely mercantile concern it gets that from the only source from which any cooperative association can draw namely the unpaid or underpaid services of its own members services which would otherwise have to be paid for To this most vital of all points we shall return There were in 1915 four other large co6perative associations of fruit growers in the state There were also a number of smaller or local associations of a similar character The following table shows the pertinent facts concerning each of the large ones Age of organ Per cent of Name Location Crop ization in state crop years controlled California F r u i t Growers Exchange Los Angeles Citrus fruits 22 69 California

which the state government has entered and for an understanding of which the above statement of the difficulties seemed to be necessary1918 The State Market Comnmission of California 9 Legislative Action The legislature of 1915 passed an act3 providing for a State Commission Market The reader will please note that the word commission is here an adjective The intent of the bill was that there should be established in the various cities or other con venient centers market places where the director a state officer should receive and sell on commission agricultural fishery dairy and farm products of California These markets were to be self sustaining froimi the commissions earned and only a small appro priation was made to cover the initial and administrative expenses At the time this bill was passed the local commission business in California products was not very large nor in the best of repute As has been shown the market foci are in the East The author of the bill seems to have had in mind open markets to which all buyers including those interested in the outside trade would resort He seems to have been much impressed by the cheese markets in Holland at Edam and at Alkmar which he had visited4 He proposed to begin with the simpler farm products such as eggs and chickens butter and garden truck but he hoped that like the seed of the acorn it would grow into the oak He also had an eye on the local fish market which later became a very interesting feature in the working out of the plan The author of the bill stated that he introduced it in response to the insistant demands of the farmers The governor who signed the bill against what he felt to be his better judgment testified to the same pressure from the farmers It would be interesting to know how the farmers became imbued with this particular idea Possibly not a little of the agitation might be traced to the wide dissemination of information concerning co6perative and open marketing in Europe that accompanied the movement for rural credits It is more likely though that the demands were in no way so specific but were only an expression of the long burning desire to get out of the hands of the packers However this first bill although it became a law never went into effect in the way the author intended Acting under the au thority of a clause in the bill that gave the director wide discre tionary powers the first director Mr Harris Weinstock with the 3Statutes of 1915 ch 713 Address by the Hon II E McPherson author of the above bill Trans actions of the Commonwealth Club of California vol X no 4 5 It will easily be apparent that the personality of the director was an10 Carl C Plehn March sanction and approval of the governor established a market com mission instead of any commission markets It is obvious that a commission market is just as different from a market commission as a chestnut horse is from a horse chestnut We are not now interested in the very pretty row which was raised in the legisla ture at its next session over this diversion of the intent of the bill The only matter of importance is that the legislature sustained the action of the director and the governor and passed a new act which provided in express terms for all the things which the direc tor had been doing for the greater part lof the two preceding years It was as if the second act chapter 802 statutes of 1917 had been in force from 1915 on and the first bill save for the creation of the office and the small appropriation had never been The following extracts from the second act state the powers and duties which had been exercised and were to be exercised There is hereby created the state market commission a state or ganization for the following purposes to wit FirstTo act as advisor for producers and distributors when re quested assisting them in economical and efficient distribution of any such products at fair prices SecondTo gather and disseminate impartial information concern ing supply and demand prevailing prices and commercial movements including common and cold storage of any such products ThirdTo promote assist and encourage the organization and opera ation of cooperative and other associations and organizations for im proving the relations and services among producers distributors and consumers of any of such products and to protect and conserve the in terests of the producers and consignors of suchi products FourthTo foster and encourage cooperation between producers and distributors of any such products in the interest of the general public FifthTo foster and encourage the standardizing grading inspec tion labelling handling storage and sale of any such products SixthTo act as a mediator or arbitrator wlhen invited by botl parties in any controversy or issue that may arise between producers and distributors of any such products irnportant feature in the establishment of this office Mr Weinstock has beeii a successful merchant His partner was the David Lubin who is known to all economists as the founder of the International Agricultural Institute Mr Weinstock had served in turn in many public offices In 1913 he served at once on the Federal Industrial Relations Commission and on the State Indus trial Accident Commission He was also a member of the American Commis sion to Investigate European Rural Credits Ia 1915 he was serving on a similar commission for the state It was his wide acquaintance with men and affairs throughout the whole state that lenit confidence to his leadership1918 The State Market Commission of California 11 SeventhTo certify for the protection of owners buyers or credit ors when so requested warehouse receipts for any such products verifying quantities and qualities thereof and to charge for such services fees sufficient to make the service at least selfsupporting EighthTo issue labels bearing the seal of the state market commis sion on request of the producer packer canner or distributor for any such products for which state labels have not otherwise been author ized by law under such rules and regulations as the director may deem necessary and to charge for such labels such fees as in the judgment of the state market director may be proper NinthTo act on behalf of the consumers of any such products in conserving and protecting their interests in every practicable way TenthTo improve broaden and extend in every practical way the distribution and sale of any such California products throughout the markets of the world EleventhTo promote in the interest of the producer the distributor and consumer economical and efficient distribution and marketing of all or any agricultural fishery dairy and farm products produced grown raised caught manufactured or processed within the state of California Initial Activities of the State Market Director One of the things which the market director did first was to ascertain the prices of Californias products in the eastern retail markets He found for example that California dried peaches for which the grower had received in 1915 212 cents a pound were retailing in New York and Chicago at from 1212 cents a pound in bulk up to 28 cents a pound in small lots for fancy grades A rough average seemed to be about 1712 cents This is the basis of the illustration used at the beginning of this article Similar data were collected for other products He also obtained a written opinion from the federal Department of Justice to the effect that cooperative associations among farmers for marketing their pro ducts might be formed in such a way as not to violate the antitrust laws and a promise that if any formed in accord with the plans of the market commission should be found to violate those laws ample notice would be given to enable them to dissolve before proceedings were begun Thus armed he returned to organize the growers We shall not take space to attempt to describe all his efforts but shall select those which seem best as illustrations of the principles involved Formation of Coiperative Associations It appeared that one of the greatest obstacles to the formation of cooperative associations among the growers was the unwillingness12 Carl C Plehn March of the growers to entrust their crops for several years to a group of untried men as directors of their associations Another difficulty lay in raising capital and other funds to finance the marketing organization In the case of the dried peach growers there was a promotion committee already at work The director joined forces with this committee and the result of the joint efforts was the California Peach Growers Inc which has under a fiveyear contract the sale of the crops from 45750 acres of orchards of such peaches as are commonly dried The association estimates the total acreage of such peaches in the state at 50000 This association has capital stock The total subscription to its stock is 848000 of which 340000 has been paid in in cash and the remainder is in the form of notes signed by the member growers The purpose of the capital stock is to enhance the credit of the growers in marketing their product In the first year of its operations this association did not acquire its own packing facilities nor build up an indepen dent marketing or sales staff But it was able to make satisfac tory negotiations for packing houses adequate for handling this years crop and has been very skillful in its relations with the com mercial packers6 The price received by the growers for their crop the first year after the association was formed was 6 cents a pound as against 21 the year before The New York retail prices to consumers showed no advance if anything a slight fall The crop was a little smaller than that of the preceding disastrous year Whether from this cause or from the formation of the association the commercial packers absorbed the extra cost Since there was but little change in the actual marketing methods beyond collective bargaining by the growers it is not yet possible to say whether the new association is finally going to be able to actually cut out some of the lost motion and cost of marketing Another industry somewhat similar to that just dealt with is the dried prune and apricot industry It is one of the largest in the state The sales run from 7000000 to 11000000 annually It is less precarious than are some of the others as the markets are older and more stable But war conditions brought the growers very low prices in 1915 The time was therefore ripe for organi zation It has beeni pointed out by Dr Lloyd in the study above referred to that it is in times that are hard for the grower that he begins to move for organization The greatest difficulty in this 6 First Annual Report of the State Market Director of California p 141918 The State Marlket Commission of California 13 case was the lack of capital to stand as security for advances from the banks to carry the crop to a more opportune time for market ing The sum required was estimated in this case at about 20 per acre of fully bearing trees about the same basis as that used by the dried peach men After many vicisitudes an association was formed in the dried prune and apricot industry Up to the pres ent however the association is not willing to give to the public a statement of its affairs There is a lively war on between the new association and the old commercial packers who are fighting to save their investment and business Then too prices have risen and as always rising prices are a menace to co6perative associa tions in tempting members to desert Several movements are underway for the organization of the olive growers But here again the recent sharp rise in the prices of olives and of olive oil has weakened the incentive to organization The strawberry growers have also an incipient organization as have the pear growers The above shows the extent to which new associations have been fostered in the fruit industry The director has also invaded the two fields in which organiza tion was most complete namely the citrus fruits and the fresh deciduous fruits As above stated the Citrus Exchange controls about 69 per cent of the crop But the other 31 per cent is the cause of some confusion and occasional gluts In the same way the deciduous fruit is divided between the California Fruit Distribu tors an association of commercial packers and the California Fruit Exchange a cooperative association the former controlling about 60 per cent the latter 20 per cent of the crop while the rest is not so well organized But the two groups do not work in har mony and sometimes gluts occur which as the auction markets are very sensitive cause trouble Of the citrus fruits the director says The lack of dependable information as to the routing and directing of the remaining one third of the crop led at times to gluts and famines in Eastern markets lowering prices over the entire country and causing losses to all producers The remedy he proposes is a state bureau of distribution modelled after that suc cessfully operated by the federal government for the marketing of melons from Imperial Valley Such a bureau or one for each of the great industries he deems necessary This suggestion met with opposition at once from the co6perative associations The reason is obvious Not only are the cooperators too recently freed from14 Carl C Plehn March the grip of the middlemen to feel free to associate with them but if there were a state bureau of this sort to which any growers could apply for information as to when and where to ship one of the strongest holds which the co6perative association has on the loyalty of its members would be lost It is because the grower cannot help himself that he joins with his fellows Still the sug gestion points to a great necessity Either the cooperative as sociations must become 100 per cent associations or they must form a truce with their enemies in this one matter Possibly with the threat of a sitate bureau before them they will form a voluntary distributing agency to which all growers and packers alike will have access With this we may conclude the discussion of the efforts of the director in improving the outside markets There are some others which might be mentioned Efforts looking to the organization of the rice growers the potato growers the hop growers and a num ber of local cooperative associations all follow substantially the lines already described It should be added that the director has busily inculcated in all branches the necessity for better grading and inspection with labels endorsed by the state as a guarantee of quality The growers are alive to this necessity and some laws with which we need not deal at present have been enacted Notable among these is the law fixing the quality of oranges to be marketed Organization of Local Markets The first bill passed by the legislature contemplated local com mission markets and free markets The director decided however that free markets were matters for the cities to provide and not for the state Municipal markets have been established from time to time in various cities with varying success But with them we are not concerned In the matter of the marketing of cattle and hogs the director is moving along the lines set forth in the first bill Nothing has yet been completed but the plans are well matured and are of interest In the marketing of cattle and hogs the big Chicago packers and one large local producer Miller and Lux have practical control of the whole situation The small farmer sells to the itinerant buyers who visit him at irregular intervals or he ships to the larger center on consignment In the first case he is handicapped by his own ignorance of the market conditions and by having to deal with a1918 The State Market Commission of Califoirnia 15 shrewd bargainer In the second case he has to ship in less than carload lots which means that he has to pay high freight rates The small farmer is also irritated by learning for example that this year beef cattle for which he gets 934 cents a pound are sell ing in Chicago at 17 cents that hogs for which he gets 15 or 16 cents a pound in San Francisco command 1812 cents in Portland a smaller market but one not dissimilar so far as being getatable by the local farmer He feels rightly or wrongly that there is no competition among the buyers and assumes that if there were he would get better prices The plan which the director is considering is To utilize the farm advisors of whom there is now under the direction of the Department of Agriculture of the University of California one in every important agricultural district for super vising the assembling of the livestock in carload lots these to be shipped to centrally located stockyards which are to be estab lished under the supervision of the market director but supported by local capital there to be graded by inspectors in the selection of whom the farmer will have a voice and to be sold either at auction or by open competitive bidding The plan may require cooperative marketing associations and even locally supported packing houses In the poultry industry two associations have sprung into exist ence since the establishment of the market commission One of these is in the northern part of the state the other in the southern It appears that in 1916 hens like human beings suffered from the high cost of living feed being very high One of the poultrymen declared that 80 per cent of the poultry men were nearly bankrupt The manager of the northern association estimates We had signed up about 1250000 hens last November The associa tion began business January 27 1917 and to August 30 1917 had marketed 150991 cases of 30 dozen eggs or 4529730 dozen eggs7 The southern association estimates the total number of hens in the district at 1300000 and they have signed up 428000 hens From January 1 to August 1 1917 they marketed 2226950 dozen eggs These associations supply cases and fillers and attend to all the work of marketing They work on the basis of a charge of 2 cents a dozen for these services and supplies They hope to be able to return some of this working margin Here too the rapid rise of prices has a tendency to undermine the loyalty of the members 7 Possibly about one fourth of the district total 16 Carl C Plehn March The director also entered the field of the milk supply of San Francisco To understand this situation we must go back a few years After the great fire in San Francisco it was decided to remove all the dairies from the city limits Hence all milk is now shipped into the city from the surrounding territory within a radius of about 100 miles About the same time and with increas ing strictness ever since the state descended upon the dairymen and required them to test their cows for tuberculosis and other diseases and to eliminate all that were found to be unhealthy to keep their milking sheds animals and milkers clean and sanitary and to pasteurize their milk All of this involved expense and required capital The dairy business has become a complex one It cannot be so easily entered and left as once was the case Combination once quite impossible and in no way to advantage has become quite possible The dairy industry too is quite sensitive to changes in the purchasing power of money On the one hand there are tradi tional or customary prices to the consumers which are not easily changed But the price of feed has advanced The advance this last year has been about 40 per cent and there was a heavy ad vance before that The labor employed in dairies is very mobile and hence wages have gone up faster than in some other lines Between the dairymen and the consumers are the distributors In San Francisco they are in a strong position They own the routes and with the housewifes stubborn prejudice for the same milkman a route is a fixed asset Then too the drivers have one of the strongest trade unions The distributors have not a close organization but they have a bottle exchange or clearing house and a credit bureau and they seem to work in harmony at least to the extent of presenting a practically solid front to the dairymen The dairymen who ship to San Francisco number some 200 There had been several efforts at cooperative organization for selling purposes These had practically all failed when the direc tor came to the rescue The last one had embraced some 95 dairymen But it could not raise quite all the capital it needed for central office and plant With the approval of the director an organization was finally perfected which now clontrols approxi mately four fifths of the supply The association works on a margin of about 5 per cent out of which after paying expenses it returns any surplus that may result in the form of a bonus in proportion to milk delivered Each member must deliver an agreed1918 The State Markeet Commission of California 17 minimum and may deliver 10 per cent more When the seasons conditions result in surplus production by the members that sur plus is manufactured into butter or cheese at the associations plant The result has been three successive increases in prices to the dairymen First it was 1612 cents a gallon f o b San Francisco then 19 cents and just lately 221 cents These increases are passed on to the consumer who paid at first 5 cents a pint and 9 cents a quart then 6 cents a pint and 10 cents a quart and now 7 cents a pint and 12 cents a quart This much must be set over against the high pricestthat the supply is fairly assured How ever the public is naturally very much dissatisfied It is pointed out that there is apparently much waste in the delivery systen which involves several milkmen traversing each block owing to duplication of routes T he whole situation is in agitation and the outcome cannot be foreseen In all of the foregoing we have found that the director makes no effort to fix prices By persuasion by pointing out the importance of the long run he has influenced the growers associations to keep to reasonable prices and not to take advantage of the tem porary stringency in the supply or intensity of demand In the next case he fixes the only legal prices The Fish Exchange Act The directors exceptional powers over the prices to be charged for fish are conferred by an act separate from the act establishing the general Market Commission This act is called The State Fish Exchange Act8 The second section of this act states the purposes as follows It is hereby declared that it is the purpose of this act to bring about an increased consumption of fresh fish by the people of California to enable them to obtain the same at reasonable prices and to empower the state market director to regulate and control the business of buying and selling fresh fish to regulate the destruction of food fish to create a state fish exchange fund to provide penalties for violations of this act to investigate and report on the fish industry and to promote the sale of fish The farreaching power thus asserted to absolutely fix the price of fish by decree rests on a novel legal theory stated in the act as follow s 8 Statutes of 1917 ch 80318 Carl C Plehn Mlarch It is hereby declared that the ownership and title to all fish found in the waters under the jurisdiction of the state are in the State of California no such fish shall be caught taken or killed in any manner or at any time except that the person so catching taking or killing or having the same in his possession irrespective of the manner in which they were obtained shall by such act or possession thereby consent that the title to such fish shall be and remain in the State of California for the purpose of regulating and controlling the use and disposition of same after such catching taking or killing except that the title to such fish legally taken shall vest in the person so taking or possessing them subject to the restrictions and provisions of law All fish found in the possession of a person within the State of Cali fornia shall be presumed to have been taken under the jurisdiction of the state It remains to be seen what the courts will say to so novel and start ling a theory of possession without property But it may be pointed out in passing that all that is really done may rest almost as well on the general police powers of the state as upon this new theory of property Under the theory of this law every dealer in fish other than the fisherman must procure a special license and dealing in fish with out a license is a misdemeanor punishable by fine or imprisonment or both Nothing is left unsaid or unthought of as to the fullness of the directors powers Thus if all else fails he can open a com mission market and compete with the older dealers Again no one may destroy food fish or divert it to any other use than human consumption without the written consent of the director with cer tain routine exceptions such as the use of fish for bait in the customary manner and the like All this be it noted was conceived and enacted before the United States entered the war It is not a reflex of the ideas of food control originating in the war It preceded them all The act does not apply in any way to canners curers or pack ers nor to sportsmen whol are regulated by the fish and game commission nor to the direct sale of fish to consumers by the fisherman nor to crustaceans or molusks except that the pro hibition as to destruction or diversion from human consumption as food is general and applies to all Sea fishing from San Francisco Bay and from the other bays and harbors along the coast is done mainly by Italians with a fringe of Danes and Norwegians There are also in some branches of the trade notably shrimp fishing some Chinese now mostly old men for the exclusion act keeps out the younger ones There are1918 The State Market Commission of California 19 in the main two classes of these fishermen supplying the store trade One class is the independent fisherman with a one man boat who generally goes out alone Occasionally two boats will work to gether with nets There are a few slightly larger boats worked by two or more men The picturesque lateen sail boats of this fleet which once dotted the bay and the ocean for miles outside have been almost entirely displaced by motor boats The second class are the steamer fishermen These work in large trawlers owned by companies or by padrones They bring in the socalled steamer fish sole sanddabs flounders hake and skate as well as other varieties In this case the company or padrone is also the wholesaler while the small boat fishermen generally sell their fish on the wharf to the middlemen The sea fishermen in San Fran cisco congregate for the most part at Fishermens Wharf built especially for their accommodation by the state which owns the whole water front of San Francisco This concentration is essen tial to the administration as conducted by the director It also gave rise to conscious or unconscious concerted action by the fisher men before control and possibly added to the popular belief that there was a fish trust The San Francisco fish consumer has long enjoyed the theory that he was virtually in the hands of a malicious fish trust which deliberately overcharged him and to do that deliberately dumped into the bay or sold to the glue and fertilizer works hundreds of tons of good fish daily Many of the independent fishermien were also galling under belief in such a trust which they felt sure was keeping down the price they received Whether or not their con viction was founded on fact is not so important for our present purpose as is the atmosphere which it created The belief was a great aid to the director It was assiduously fostered by the news papers a topic to fill space when exciting news was lacking The dealers admitted that there was waste of food fish But they claimed and with truth that the public would buy only certain varieties that are relatively scarce and hence dear such as halibut salmon smelt striped bass and especially tenderloin of sole and would not buy the equally good varieties that could be had for less money Then too the habit of eating fish only on Friday obvi ously hampered the trade Under the old law that of 1915 before he had the express power to fix prices the director had entered this field He brought about an organization of all the factors the large and small fishermen the wholesalers and the retailers This organization known as20 Carl C Plehn Marlch the Fish Exchange set out to eduicate the public to eat more fish and thus to prevent dumping and to lower the cost of fish by cutting down the overhead per pound The association was volun tary and subscriptions toward ani advertising fund were called for in proportion to the interest of eachi member Advertisements such as the following were spread broadcast For the first time in the history of business so far as we know a commodity is to be marketed by a method in which the consumer the retailer the wholesaler and the producer all have a say The interests of each are protected through control by the State Commission Market acting under the law of the state The consumer will be protected in the price of fish by the daily publication of the maximum retail prices By this plan it is hoped to so increase the use of fish that the cost of living will be less while the greater amount of business thus given the fishermen and dealers will pay them for the lower prices    The first lowering of prices saves the consumers 10 per cent on the price of the fish and this saving will amount to 3o0000 a year    If every family realized that it could get fresh fislh every day in the week and that it could get fresh fish at very low prices the eating of fish would double and the benefits would be greater because fish is good to eat it is easily digested it is healthful and saves money ALL ARE INTERESTED Representatives of the interests mentioned above will meet every business day They will have the fullest information as to the available supply and will decide what shall be the maximum retail price which the consumer should pay Note that there are two representatives of the state on this Committee whose duty it is to look after the interest of the public and see that fish is sold as cheaply as fair returns to the fishermen and the dealers will warrant    The fishermenthose who go out in boats on the ocean bay and rivers to catch the fish and bring them in to Fishermans Wharf the wholesalersthose who bring the fish to the city and prepare it for market and the retailers who buy the fish from the wholesaler and sell it to you and the state of Cali forniathrough its Market Director and the State Fish and Game Commission have formed an organization representing the producer the dealers and the

above extracts show very clearly the economic lines upon which the director began They have all been carried over into the renewed efforts under the new law with the added force of the directors power to fix the legal prices But the first effort ran upon a snag It depended upon the payment of the subscriptions by the dealers To use the language of the director But Mr A Paladini one of the larger wholesale dealers who had signed the agreement    threw a monkey wrench into the machinery of proposed fish distribution That is he refused to pay his quota of the expenses This nullified the first effort and gave occasion for the more drastic law The new plan does not involve an exchange nor in fact any special organization of the fishermen or dealers The expense is to be met by the license fees These unfortunately were set too low but that can be remedied The procedure is as follows Each evening after the fishermen have come home a representative of the director goes around the bulkhead and ascertains how much the catch of each variety has been The holdover of each variety in the hands of the dealers is also reported on On the basis of this information such a price is fixed for each variety as experience has shown will probably carry off the existing stock These prices are then published in the morning papers as the only legal prices at retail for that day Dealers may charge less but not more than these prices which are the prices to the consumers This is the beginning only for the next step is to fix the prices that will be paid by the retailers to the wholesalers and by the wholesalers to the fishermen For this purpose schedules have been worked out by negotiations The schedule for each variety of fish is different These schedules are the subject of constant dis cussion and revision and will be so for some time to come for one of the factors is necessarily the increase in the demand which is growing daily A few samples will show the method It was first ascertained thatin cod the loss by evaporation of water content shrinkage was about 3 per cent the loss by removing the entrails etc 24 per cent the loss by removing the unmarketable heads tails and bones 22 per cent total losses 49 per cent That is to say that for every 100 pounds of fish caught there are only 51 pounds saleable to the consumer If the whole22 Carl C Plehn March saler does the first cleaning and bears the shrinkage while the re tailer cuts off the heads tails fins and removes bones the whole saler buys 100 pounds and sells 73 pounds the retailer buys 73 pounds and sells 51 pounds Let us then start with the assumption that the fisherman gets 3 cents a pound that the wholesaler should have 25 per cent of his receipts to cover his expenses and to allow him a profit and that the retailer whose expenses may be heavier and who carries the final risk should be allowed 33 13 per cent of his receipts for his expenses and a profit Then the computation runs somewhat as follows The fisherman sells 100 pounds at 3 cents and gets   300 The wholesaler loses 27 pounds which cost him at 3 cents   81 Cost to the wholesaler per 100 pounds bought   381 Wholesalers allowance for expenses and profit 13   127 Cost to this point per 100 pounds sold   508 Retailer loses 22 pounds which cost him at 0508   112 Cost to retailer per 100 pounds bought   620 Retailers allowance 12 of 620   310 Total cost per 100 pounds sold by retailer  930 Theoretically the prices should then run to the consumer 0930 per pound to the wholesaler 0508 per pound and to the fisherman 03 per pound Reversing the process and showing the division of the consumers dollar we have For waste  207  retailer   333  wholesaler   137  fislherman   323 100 Practically then if the price that will carry off the supply is 9 cents the wholesaler should get say 5 cents a pound and the fisher man 3 cents for it is not necessary to carry out the fractions to the finest point As an example of the revision of such schedules we may cite the case of rock cod These are now firsL graded into two classes those under 5 pounds and those over When they are under 5 pounds the retailer does all the cleaning and gets 45 per cent of the price for that day the wholesaler gets 15 per cent and the fisherman gets 40 per cent But for those over 5 pounds the wholesaler does part of the cleaning the retailer gets 50 per cent the wholesaler 20 per cent and the fisherman 30 per cent In the latter case the retailer is favored because of the greater risk of spoilage1918 T7he Sttatc Market Comnnission of California 23 There are mlaniy schedules more complicated Thus filet of sole which is a great favorite because all solid meat has to be prepared by boning and removing two skins It takes 10 pounds of fish caught to make 334 pounds of filet But the fishermen brings in the sole in 80 pound boxes containing all sizes of fish and sells them as they run not all are equally suitable for filet These examiiples inust suffice to show the methods of what is coming in the parlance of the times to be called scientific price making by government It remains to explain how it is that the three parties came to agree to this drastic regulationi The fact is so far as can be learned they are all fairly happy about it Obviously it is useless even for the law to fix a price for fish unless the fisherman fishes the middleman middles and the retailer retails Perhaps of the three the fisherman is the least independent for his boat with tackle represents an investment of some 1500 to 2000 which often is his all Still there are other uses for boats and he can fish for the canners A few marginal fishermen working or loafing or turning to some other job make quite a difference in the marginal supply Then too fishermans luck comes in Generally speaking a big catch even at lower prices gives him more earnings than a small catch The basic uInit is not the pound of fish caught but the result of the days work Obviously the big catch comes round more often when fishing every day than once a week The long market gives steadier earnings Obviously too the retailer who has to have proper facilities for keeping the fish fresh cuts his overhead per pound very rapidly if the turnover increases To a less degree the wholesaler profits in like manner by thie increase in the bulk handled Getting the people to eat more fish was the key to success Fortunately for the mnovement it struck a time whein owing to the high cost of living and the patriotic impulse to con serve nonperishable foods the people were very much in a miood to listen to the call eat more fish The daily publication of fish prices hints as to what is most abundant each day information as to new varieties not well known have been eagerly accepted A greater quantity of fish is being eaten and what is more its use is not confined to Friday Even in small places the retailer now often carries soniie fish every day in the week It is difficult to strike any average of prices for the season the run and so on have a great influence Yet there is nio question but that the prices of fish are below what they were under corresponding conditions be24 Carl C Plehn March fore the fish bill was put into effect and that in face of the fall in the purchasing power of money So far the fish market experiment is a success III Summary Co6peration has been in the main the directors weapon Co operation is not a magic wand which creates something out of nothing No mere change of system from commercialism to co6peration will per se save or make money The gain or saving made by eliminating misdirected shipments or ill informed and reckless competition can be made by intelligent middlemen as well as by co6perative associations The saving made by sheer size of the marketing organization under the law of diminishing cost can be made by a big commercial house at least as well as by a big co6perative association In fact there is a lot of waste motion of slack in all co6perative associationstoo much debating too many committees Nor is there any inherent reason why the gains and savings brought about by government action in the cases under review could not have been attained entirely by private in itiative whether through the old type of middlemen or by co operation In this case government intervention stimulated private action The money which the successful co6perative association of grow ers pays to its members as a profit over what they would get if the business of packing and marketing were as well done by middlemen is compensation for services for work done by the members them selves which under the other system they hired middlemen to do and paid them for doing The question whether co6perative pack ing and marketing is fundamentally better than the other method turns entirely upon whether the members of the co6perative grow ers associations can or cannot use the strength and time which they put into the running of their associations to as good advan tage in any other way In fruit growing the orchards need com paratively little attention during quite a period after the crop is harvested During this period the grower has some free time which he can devote to other work than the care of the trees and it ap pears that the marketing of his crop is a line of other work into which he is most likely to put his heart If he does this rather than take a vacation or hunt other work in which he has no such1918 Thc Statc Market Commission of California 25 vital interest there is clearly a social profit which he earns If as is usually the case his general intelligence and knowledge is in creased by the education this new work gives him there is still further gain Not all members need to participate but many actually do in varying degree This seems to be the convincing argument in favor of co6peration Does the co6perative movement need government aid or control Does it need help at the start only as an infant industry needs a protective tariff or all the time Again does society need to be protected against the selfishness or shortsightedness of monopolis tic co6peration Co6perative associations spring quite readily and almost spon taneously into existence when conditions are admittedly bad They die as readily unless the new organization shows immediate favor able results Moreover only those associations have survived which have obtained a substantial monopoly Large size is essen tial Permanency requires continued loyalty of members for dis integration cannot be prevented by mere written contracts Loy alty rests on confidence in the management and that in turn on tried business ability If some man or men does not arise in the association of sufficient personal force to lead and business ability to direct and usually with a willingness to make consider able personal sacrifices for the general good confidence soon wanes and loyalty disappears Then contracts become scraps of paper If the outside buyer can offer terms that pay off the mortgage on the land or the capital stock investment required to bind the members to the association there are likely to be some who are tempted It is in inspiring confidence that the first function of the government director is found His position as a government official inspires respect and lends weight to his advice If nothing else he affords a medium through which divergent interests or fac tions may be brought to meet each other and often the meeting will result in reconciliation It appears then that the market director may not only aid in the beginning but that he has a permanent function Obviously he must be one whose personality commands the same sort of confidence which the successful cooperative mana ger needs The co6perative association must have a substantial monopoly in order to live Herein of course lies a menace to the consumer So far all the evidence relating to the California experiment points to a small reduction in prices to the consumer and what is perhaps26 Carl C Plehn March niore important a greatly enhailced and improved service to him as a result of co6perative mnarketing in general and of that under the guidance of the market director9 Several things seem to promise the safeguarding of these gains The most important is that the best asset such an association can have is goodwill To sell frosted oranges means loss of trade the next year The grow ers trees are a heavy investment and he naturally takes the long run view The demand is very elastic while the supply each year is a fixed fact The grower has comparatively little to gain in normal years by withholding fruit from sale In view of this it seems hardly possible that the statefostered co6perative monopo lies will become a Frankenstein But there is the possibility that some day the market director may have to discipline his progeny as does every other father There is one feature of the work of the market director that is very important and that was passed over with slight mention in connection with the different products discussed above because it would have involved unnecessary repetition That feature is in specting and grading and certifying to grades In the interest both of the grower and of the consumer this is obviously better done by government authority than by any private packer or dealer The director is working toward this end in that he is supplementing a long line of legislation becoining gradually more and more strict as time passes For example the state now has a law grading oranges and forbidding the marketing as sound fruit of any oranges that do not come up to a high standard of quality The principle is so simple that further discussion seems unnecessary The experiment with legal price fixing in the case of fish has been lauded as scientific It is at bottom the art of guaging in the light of day to day experience the prices that will carry off the supply It is conducted with the great advantage that the success or failure of the price is known within twentyfour hours This is the case with but few commodities Another advantage is that the supply is a known fact when the price is fixed The only estimate 9 This year 1917 the new prune and apricot growers association is reported to have fixed a price below that of the commercial packers How much of this is the result of the packers efforts to break down the association is not clear More clearcut is the action of the raisin growers in fixing a fair price regardless of the possibility of a decided rise under the market conditions1918 The State Market Comnmission of California 27 is that applying to the demand Yet government price fixing even under the favorable conditions that prevail here seems to break all the accepted rules as to the proper scope for such interference Fish is not a necessity it is only a satisfactory substitute for dear but customary necessities It is doubtful if it ever was a monopoly and it certainly is not necesarily so for the ocean teems with fish and every one has free access to the ocean There is and always was an almost instantaneous response to price changes On the other hand the marketing methods were inefficient and deep ignor ance of the market prevailed The market director has removed that ignorance by becoming a common center for the three parties most concerned the fisherman the wholesaler and the retailer Yet after all the startling success of the experiment rests to some degree on the extraordinary conditions of the time It may be that it will become permanenteating fish may become a habit Addendum On October 22 1917 the day the manuscript of this article was finished occurred the formation of the California Federation of Farmers Cooperative Associations under the guidance of the mar ket director This was at once joined by eight associations which are among those mentioned in this article It is formed to care for the common interests of the various associations As set forth in the agreement the common interests include the interchange of ideas and the collection of data relating to co6perative organiza tions including legislation and court decisions It plans among other things for the joint employment of brokers and salaried agents in the eastern markets the maintenance of an allyearround sales organization the education of retailers as to the handling of products this applies mainly to fresh fruits and vegetables the joint purchase of supplies the strengthening of the credit of the members the maintenance of a joint labor bureau and for a joint advertising campaign The director has high hopes for the future of this new organization He says The Federation should de velop into a giant of giants of co6perative marketing associations that may become an object lesson to the whole world CARL C PLEHN University of California

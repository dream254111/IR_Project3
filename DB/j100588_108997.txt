J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,108997,A MEMOIR ON CUBIC SURFACES,I207024, 231  VII A MEMOIR ON CUBIC SURFACES BY PROFESSOR CAYLEY FS RECEIVED NOVEMBER 12 1868READ JANUARY 14 1869 THE PRESENT MEMOIR IS BASED UPON AND IS IN A MEASURE SUPPLEMENTARY TO THAT BY PRO FESSOR SCHLXPLI  ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF SURFACES OF THE THIRD ORDER INTO SPECIES IN REFERENCE TO THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF SINGULAR POINTS AND THE REALITY OF THEIR LINES PHIL TRANS VOL CLIII 1863 PP 193241 BUT THE OBJECT OF THE MEMOIR IS DIFFERENT I DISREGARD ALTOGETHLER THE ULTIMATE DIVISION DEPENDING ON THE REALITY OF THE LINES ATTEND ING ONLY TO THE DIVISION INTO TWENTYTWO OR AS I PREFER TO RECKON IT TWENTYTHREE CASES DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE SINGULARITIES AND I ATTEND TO THE QUESTION VERY MUCH ON ACCOUNT OF THE LIGHT TO BE OBTAINED IN REFERENCE TO THE THEORY OF RECIPROCAL SURFACES THE MEMOIR REFERRED TO FURNISHES IN FACT A STORE OF MATERIALS FOR THIS PURPOSE INASMUCH AS IT GIVES PARTIALLY OR COMPLETELY DEVELOPED THE EQUATIONS IN PLANECOORDINATES OF THE SEVERAL CASES OF CUBIC SURFACES OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING THE EQUATIONS IN POINTCOOR DINATES OF THE SEVERAL SURFACES ORDERS 12 TO 3 RECIPROCAL TO THESE REPECTIVELY I FOUND BY EXAMINATION OF THE SEVERAL CASES THAT AN EXTENSION WAS REQUIRED OF DR SALMONS THEORY OF RECIPROCAL SURFACES IN ORDER TO MAKE IT APPLICABLE TO THE PRESENT SUBJECT AND THE PRECEDING  MEMOIR ON THE THEORY OF RECIPROCAL SURFACES  WAS WRITTEN IN CONNEXION WITH THESE INVESTIGATIONS ON CUBIC SURFACES THE LATTER PART OF THE MEMOIR IS DIVIDED INTO SECTIONS HEADED THUS SECTION 112 EQUATION X Y Z W30  C REFERRING TO THE SEVERAL CASES OF THE CUBIC SURFACE BUT THE PARAGRAPHS ARE NUMBERED CONTINUOUSLY THROUGH THE MEMOIR THE TWENTYTHREE CASES OF

SHALL USUALLY RETAIN IN CONNEXION WITLI THE ROMAN NUMBER SHOWS THERE FORE IN EACH CASE WHAT THE CLASS IS AND ALSO THE SINGULARITIES WHICH CAUSE THE REDUCTION THUS XIII 12B32C2 INDICATES THAT THERE IS A BIPLANAR NODE B3 DIMINISHING THE CLASS BY 3 AND TWO CONICNODES C0 EACH DIMINISHING THE CLASS BY 2 AND THUS THAT THE CLASS IS 12322 5 AS REGARDS THE CASES XXII AND XXIII THESE ARE SURFACES HAVING A NODAL RIGHT LINE AND ARE CONSEQUENTLY SCROLLS EACH OF THE CLASS 3 VIZ XXII IS THE SCROLL S1 1 HAVING A SIMPLE DIRECTRIX RIGHT LINE DISTINCT FROM THE NODAL LINE AND XXIII IS THE SCROLL S1 1 HAVING A SIMPLE DIRECTRIX RIGHT LINE COINCIDENT WITH THE NODAL LINE SEE AS TO THIS MY  SECOND MEMOIR ON SKEW SURFACES OTHERWISE SCROLLS PHIL TRANS VOL CLIV 1864 PP 559577 3 THE NATURE OF THE POINTS C 33 B B  36 U7 U REQUIRES TO BE EXPLAINED C02 IS A CONICNODE WHERE INSTEAD OF THE TANGENT PLANE WE HAVE A PROPER QUADRIC CONE BB3 B B OR B IS A BIPLANARNODE WHERE THE QUADRIC CONE BECOMES A PLANEPAIR TWO DISTINCT PLANES THE TWO PLANES ARE CALLED THE BIPLANES AND THEIR LINE OF INTERSEC TION IS THE EDGE IN B3 THE EDGE IS NOT A LINE ON THE SURFACEIN THE OTHER CASES IT IS THIS IMPLIES THAT THE SURFACE IS TOUCHED ALONG THE EDGE BY A PLANE VIZ IN B4 B THE EDGE IS TORSAL IN B IT IS OSCULAR 232PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES IN B4 THE TANGENT PLANE IS DISTINCT FROM EACH OF THE BIPLANES IN B THE TANGENT PLANE COINCIDES WITH ONE OF THE BIPLANES WE HAVE THUS AN ORDINARY BIPLANE AND A TORSAL BIPLANE IN B6 THE TANGENT PLANE COINCIDING WITH ONE OF THE BIPLANES BECOMES OSCULAR WE HAVE THUS AN ORDINARY BIPLANE AND AN OSCULAR BIPLANE UU6 U7 OR U8 IS A UNIPLANARNODE WHERE THE QUADRIC CONE BECOMES A COINCIDENT PLANEPAIR SAY THE PLANE IS THE UNIPLANE IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THERE IS NOT IN THIS CASE ANY EDGE THE UNIPLANE MEETS THE CUBIC SURFACE IN THREE LINES OR SAY RAYS PASSING THROUGH THE UNIPLANARNODE VIZ IN U6 THE RAYS ARE THREE DISTINCT LINES IN U7 TWO OF THEM COINCIDE IN U8 THEY ALL THREE COINCIDE 4 TO CONNECT THESE SINGULAR POINTS WITH THE THEORY OF THE PRECEDING MEMOIR IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THEY AIE RESPECTIVELY EQUIVALENT TO A CERTAIN NUMBER OF THE CNICNODES CC2 AND BINODES BB VIZ WE HAVE C2 C B3 B B42C B C B JB63C 1U6 3C U72C B U8 C2B 5 I TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY OF REMARKING THAT ALTHOUGH THE EXPRESSIONS CNICNODE AND BINODE PROPERLY REFER TO THE SIMPLE SINGULARITIES C AND B YET AS CC C2 IS PROPERLY SPOKEN OF AS A CNICNODE AND WE MAY USING THE TERM BINODE AS AN ABBREVIATION FOR BIPLANARNODE SPEAK OF ANY OF THE SINGULARITIES B B4 B B6 AS A BINODE THUS THE SURFACE X12B4C HAS A BINODE B4 AND A CNICNODE C2 ALTHOUGH THEORETICALLY THE BINODE B4 IS EQUIVALENT TO TWO CNICNODES AND THE SURFACE BELONGS TO THOSE WITH THREE CNICNODES OR FOR WHICH C3 I USE ALSO THE EXPRESSION UNODE FOR SHORTNESS INSTEAD OF UNIPLANARNODE TO DENOTE ANY OF THE SINGULARITIES U6 U7 US 6 THE FOREGOING EQUATIONS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS SCHLXFLIS ARE CANONICAL FORMS THE REDUCTION OF THE EQUATION OF ANY CASE OF SURFACE TO THE ABOVE FORM IS NOT ALWAYS OBVIOUS IT WOULD APPEAR THAT EACH EQUATION IS FROM ITS SIMPLICITY IN THE FORM BEST ADAPTED TO THE SEPARATE DISCUSSION OF THE SURFACE TO WHICH IT BELONGS THERE IS THE DISAD VANTAGE THAT THE EQUATIONS DO NOT ALWAYS WHEN FROM THE GEOMETRICAL CONNEXION OF THE SUR FACES THEY OUGHT TO DO SO LEAD THE ONE TO THE OTHER FOR INSTANCE V12B4 INCLDES VII12 B5 BUT WE CANNOT FROM THE EQUATION WXZ XZYAX2X2 BZ2 OF THE FORMER PASS TO THE EQUATION WXZY2ZYXXX30 OF THE LATTER THIS WOULD BE A SERIOUS IMPERFECTION IF THE OBJECT WERE TO FORM A THEORY OF THE QUATERNARY FUNCTION MDCCCLXIX 2 K 233PROFESSOR COAYLE ON CUBIC SUIRFAES X Y Z W3 BUT THE EQUATIONS ARE IN THE PRESENT MEMOIR USED ONLY AS MEANS TO AN END THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE GEOMETRICAL THEORY OF THE SURFACES TO WHICH THEY RESPEC TIVELY BELONG AND THE IMPERFECTION IS NOT MATERIAL 7 IE HAVE USED THE CAPITAL LETTERS X Y Z W IN PLACE OF SC11LXFLIS X Y Z W RESERVING THESE IN PLACE OF HIS P Q R S FOR PLANECOORDINATES OF THE CUBIC SURFACES OR WHAT IS THE SAME THING POINTCOORDINATES OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACES BUT I HAVE IN SEVERAL CASES INTERCHANGED THE COORDINATES X Y Z W SO THAT THEY DO NOT IM THIS ORDER CORRESPOND TO SCHLIPRLIS X Y  W THIS HAS BEEN DONE SO AS TO OBTAIN A GREATER UNI FORMITY IN THE REPRESENTATION OF THE SURFACES TO EXPLAIN THIS LET A B C D BE THE VERTICES OF THE TETRAHEDRON FORMED BY THE COORDINATE PLANES AYZW BZWX CWXY DXYZ THE COORDINATE PLANES HAVE BEEN CHOSEN SO THAT DETERMINATE VERTICES OF THE TETRAHEDRON SHALL CORRESPOND TO DETERMINATE SINGULARITIES OF THE SURFACE 8 CONSIDER FIRST THEL SURFACES WHICH HAVE NO NODES B OR U IT IS CLEAR THAT THE NODES C2 MIGHT HAVE BEEN TAKEN AT ANY VERTICES WHATEVER OF THE TETRAHEDRON THEY ARE TAKEN THUS THERE IS ALWAYS A NODE C2

BE XO Z0 THE EDGE BEING THEREFORE IDB VIZ IN B5 OR B6 WHERE THE DISTINCTION ARISES X 0 IS THE ORDINARY BIPLANE Z0 THE TORSAL OR AS THE CASE MAY BE OSCULAR BIPLANE IF THERE IS A SECOND NODE THIS OF NECESSITY LIES IN AN ORDINARY BIPLANE IT MAY BE AND IS TAKEN TO BE IN THE BIPLANE X0 AT C I SUPPOSE FOR A MOMENT THAT THIS IS A NODE C2 IT IS ONLY WHEN THE BINODE IS B3 OR B4 THAT THERE CAN BE A THIRD NODE FOR IT IS ONLY IN THESE CASES THAT THERE IS A SECOND ORDINARY BIPLANE Z0  BUT IN THESE CASES RESPECTIVELY THE THIRD NODE A C2 MAY BE AND IS TAKEN TO BE IN THE BIPLANE Z  0 AT A 10 THE ONLY CASE OF TWO BINODES IS WHEN EACH IS A B3 HERE THE FIRST IS AS ABOVE AT D ITS BIPLANES BEING X0O Z0 AND THE SECOND IS AS ABOVE IN THE BIPLANE XO AT C THE BIPLANES THEREOF ARE THEN X 0 WHICH IS THUS A BIPLANE COMMON TO THE TWO BINODES OR SAY A COMMON BIPLANE AND A REMAINING BIPLANE WHICH MAY BE AND IS TAKEN TO BE W 0 IF THERE IS A THIRD NODE THIS MAY BE EITHER C2 OR B3 BUT IT WILL IN EITHER CASE LIE IN THE BIPLANE Z0 OF THE FIRST BINODE AND ALSO IN THE BIPLANE W0 OF THE SECOND BINODE THAT IS IN THE LINE BA AND IT MAY BE AND IS TAKEN TO BE AT A IF A BINODE THEN ITS BIPLANES ARE OF NECESSITY Z0

UNIPLANE IS HOWEVER TAKEN TO BE XYZO0 THERE IS NEVER BESIDES THE UNODE ANY OTHER NODE 12 THE RESULT IS THAT THE NODES IN THE ORDER OF THEIR SPECIALITY ARE IN THE EQUATIONS TAKEN TO BE AT D C A B RESPECTIVELY AND THAT EXCEPT IN THE CASE III 12 B3 THE BIPLANES OF THE FIRST BINODE ARE X 0 Z 0 FOR A BINODE B5 OR B6 X 0 BEING THE ORDINARY BIPLANE Z0 THE SPECIAL BIPLANE THOSE OF THE SECOND BINODE

19 14 IN THE SEVERAL CASES I TO XXI WE HAVE A CUBIC SURFACE N 3 WITH SINGULAR POINTS C AND B BUT WITHOUT SINGULAR LINES THE SECTION BY AN ARBITRARY PLANE IS THUS A CURVE ORDER N 3 THAT IS A CUBIC CURVE WITHOUT NODES OR CUSPS AND THEREFORE OF THE CLASS A 6 HAVING 0 DOUBLE TANGENTS AND 9 INFLEXIONS THE TANGENT CONE WITH AN ARBITRARY POINT AS VERTEX IS A CONE OF THE ORDER A6 HAVING IN THE CASE I12 50 NODAL LINES AND Z6 CUSPIDAL LINES BUT WITH IN THE SEVERAL OTHER CASES C NODAL LINES AND B CUSPIDAL LINES OR RATHER SINGULAR LINES TANTAMOUNT TO C DOUBLE LINES AND B CUSPIDAL LINES THE CLASS OF THE CONE OR ORDER OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS THUS 6520 C36B122B3C 15 IN THE GENERAL CASE I12 THERE ARE ON THE CUBIC SURFACE 27 LINES LYING BY 3S IN 45 PLANES THESE 27 LINES CONSTITUTE THE NODECOUPLE CURVE OF THE ORDER 27 AND THE NODECOUPLE TORSE CONSISTS OF THE PENCILS OF PLANES THROUGH THESE LINES RESPECTIVELY BEING THUS OF THE CLASS  627 THE 45 PLANES ARE TRIPLE TANGENT PLANES OF THE NODECOUPLE TORSE WHICH HAS THUS T45 TRIPLE TANGENT PLANES BUT IN THE OTHER CASES IT IS ONLY CERTAIN OF THE 27 LINES SAY THE FACULTATIVE LINES AS WILL BE EXPLAINED WHICH CONSTITUTE THE NODECOUPLE CURVE OF THE ORDER E THE PENCILS OF PLANES THROUGH THESE LINES CONSTITUTE THE NODECOUPLE TORSE OF THE CLASS B THE T PLANES EACH CONTAINING THREE FACULTATIVE LINES ARE THE TRIPLE TANGENT PLANES OF THE NODECOUPLE TORSE OR IF AS IS SOMEWHAT MORE CON VENIENT WE REFER THE NUMBERS B T TO THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE THEN THE LINES RECIPROCALS OF THE FACULTATIVE LINES CONSTITUTE THE NODAL CURVE OF THE ORDER B AND THE POINTS T EACH CONTAINING THREE OF THESE LINES ARE THE TRIPLE POINTS OF THE NODAL CURVE INASMUCH AS THE NODAL CURVE CONSISTS OF RIGHT LINES THE NUMBER KI OF ITS APPARENT DOUBLE POINTS IS GIVEN BY THE FORMULA 2KB 2 61 AND COMPARING WITH THE FORMULA 6Y2B2K3Y6T WE HAVE Q3Y0 THAT IS 0 Q THE CLASS OF THE NODAL CURVE AND ALSO Y 0 16 IN THE GENERAL CASE I12 THE SPINODE CURVE IS THE COMPLETE INTERSECTION OF THE CUBIC SURFACE BY THE HESSIAN SURFACE OF THE ORDER 4 AND IT IS THUS OF THE ORDER DO12 BUT IN THE OTHER CASES THE COMPLETE INTERSECTION CONSISTS OF THE SPINODE CURVE TOGETHER WITH CERTAIN RIGHT LINES NOT BELONGING TO THE CURVE AND THE SPINODE CURVE IS OF AN ORDER A LESS THAN 12 THIS WILL BE FURTHER EXPLAINED AND THE REDUCTION ACCOUNTED FOR SEE POST NOS 24 ET SEQ 17 AGAIN IN THE GENERAL CASE 112 EACH OF THE 27 LINES IS A DOUBLE TANGENT OF THE SPINODE CURVE AND THE TANGENT PLANES OF THE SURFACE AT THE POINTS OF CONTACT ARE COMMON TANGENT PLANES OF THE SPINODE TORSE AND THE NODECOUPLE TORSE STATIONARY PLANES OF THE SPINODE TORSE OR WE HAVE 3P254 IN THE OTHER CASES HOWEVER INSTEAD OF THE 27 LINES WE MUST TAKE ONLY THE FACULTATIVE LINES EACH OF WHICH IS OR IS NOT A DOUBLE OR A SINE TANGENT OF THE SPINODE CURVE AND THE TANGENT PLANES OF THE SURFACE AT THE POINTS OF CONTACT ARE THE COMMON TANGENT PLANES AS ABOVETHAT IS THE NUMBER OF CONTACTS GIVES 3 NOT IN GENERAL2 236PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES 18 THERE ARE NOT EXCEPT AS ABOVE ANY COMMON TANGENT PLANES OF THE TWO TORSES THAT IS NOT ONLY YR0 AS ALREADY MENTIONED BUT ALSO I0 I DO NOT AT PRESENT ACCOUNT A PRIORI FOR THE VALUES O16 8 AND 16 WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES IN THE TABLE THE CUBIC SURFACE CANNOT HAVE A PLANE OF CONIC CONTACT AND WE HAVE THUS IN EVERY CASE C0 BUT THE VALUE OF B IS NOT IN EVERY CASE  0 19 IN WHAT PRECEDES WE SEE HOW A DISCUSSION OF THE EQUATION OF THE CUBIC SURFACE SHOULD IN THE SEVERAL CASES RESPECTIVELY LEAD TO THE VALUES B T  Y FLJ  B AND HOW IN THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE THE NODAL CURVE OF THE ORDER B IS KNOWN BY MEANS OF THE FACULTATIVE LINES OF THE ORIGINAL CUBIC SURFACE THE CUSPIDAL CURVE C MIGHT ALSO BE OBTAINED AS THE RECIPROCAL OF THE SPINODETORSE BUT THIS WOULD IN GENERAL BE A LABORIOUS PROCESS AND IT IS THE LESS NECESSARY INASMUCH AS THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS IN EACH CASE OBTAINED IN A FORM PUTTING IN EVIDENCE THE CUSPIDAL CURVE THE LINES AND PLANES OF A CUBIC SURFACE FACULTATIVE LINES EXPLANATION OF DIAGRAMS ARTICLE NOS 20 TO 23 20 IN THE GENERAL SURFACE 112 WE HAVE 27 LINES AND 45 TRIPLETANGENT PLANES OR SAY SIMPLY PLANES THROUGH EACH LINE PASS 5 PLANES IN EACH PLANE LIE 3 LINES FOR THE SURFACES II TO XXI THE PRESENT CONSIDERATIONS DO NOT OF COURSE APPLY TO THE SCROLLS SEVERAL OF THE LINES COME TO COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER AND SEVERAL OF THE PLANES ALSO COME TO COINCIDE WITH EACH OTHER BUT THE NUMBER OF THE LINES IS ALWAYS RECKONED AS 27 AND THAT OF THE PLANES AS 45 IF WE ATTEND TO THE DISTINCT LINES AND THE DISTINCT PLANES EACH LINE HAS A MULTIPLICITY AND THE SUM OF THESE IS 27 AND SO EACH PLANE HAS A MUL TIPLICITY AND THE SUM OF THESE IS45 AGAIN ATTENDING TO A PARTICULAR LINE IN A PAR TICULAR PLANE THE LINE HAS A FREQUENCY 1 2 OR 3 THAT IS IT REPRESENTS 1 2 OR 3 OF THE 3 LINES IN THE PLANE THIS IS IN FACT THE DISTINCTION OF A SCROLAR TORSAL OR OSCULAR LINE AND SIMILARLY THE PLANE HAS A FREQUENCY 1 2 3 4 OR 5 ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER WHICH IT REPRESENTS OF THE 5 PLANES THROUGH THE LINE IT REQUIRES ONLY A LITTLE CONSIDERATION TO PERCEIVE THAT THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE PLANE INTO ITS FREQUENCY IN REGARD TO THE LINE IS EQUAL TO THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE LINE INTO ITS FREQUENCY IN REGARD TO THE PLANE OBSERVE FURTHER THAT IF M BE THE MULTIPLICITY OF THE PLANE THEN CONSIDERING IT IN REGARD TO THE LINES CON TAINED THEREIN WE GET THE PRODUCTS M M M 2M M OR 3M ACCORDING AS THE THREE LINES ARE OR ARE NOT DISTINCT BUT THAT THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS IS ALWAYS 3M AND THAT IN REGARD TO ALL THE PLANES THE TOTAL SUM IS 3 X 45  135 AND SO IF M BE THE MULTIPLI CITY OF THE LINE THEN CONSIDERING IT IN REGARD TO THE PLANES WHICH PASS THROUGH IT WE GET THE PRODUCTS M M M M M 2M M M M    5M AS THE CASE MAY BE BUT THAT THE SUM OF THE PRODUCTS IS 5M AND THAT IN REGARD TO ALL THE LINES THE SUM IS 5X 27 135 AS BEFORE 21 THE MODE OF COINCIDENCE OF THE LINES AND PLANES AND THE SEVERAL DISTINCT LINES AND PLANES WHICH ARE SITUATE IN OR PASS THROUGH THE SEVERAL DISTINCT PLANES AND LINES RESPEC TIVELY ARE SHOWN IN THE ANNEXED DIAGRAMS I TO XXI  THE MULTIPLICITY OF EACH LINE  SEE THE COMMENCEMENTS OF THE SEVERAL SECTIONS 2373PROFESSORR ICAYLEY OIN CUBIC SURFACES APPEARS BY THE UPPER MARGINAL LINE AND THAT OF EACH PLANE BY THE LEFTHAND MARGINAL COLUMN THUS IN DIAGRAM I 27 X 127 AND 45 X 145 1 IS TE MUTIPLICIY OFEACH LINE AND IT IS ALSO FACLETHE MLTIPLICI EACHPNE THE FREQUENCIES OF A LINE AND PLANE IN EGARD TO EACH OTHER APPEAR BY THE DOTS IN THE SQUARE OPPOSITE TO THE LINE AND PLANE IN QUESTION THESE BEING READ FOR THE FREQUENCY OF THE LINE VERTICALLY AND FOR THE FREQUENCY OF THE PLANE HORIZONTALLY THUS  INDICATES THAT THE FREQUENCY OF THE LINE IS 3 AND THE FREQUENCY OF THE PLANE IS 2 THERE SHOULD BE AND ARE IN EVERY LINE OF THE DIAGRAM 3 DOTS AND IN EVERY COLUMN OF THE DIAGRAM 5 DOTS A SYMBOL M BEING READ AS JUST EXPLAINED 2 DOTS IN THE LINE 3 DOTS IN THE COLUMN 22 FOR THE URFACE 1EI12 THERE IS OF COURSE NO DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LINES BUT THESE FORM ONLY A SINGLE CLASS AND THE LIKE FOR THE PLANES BUT FOR THE OTHER SUR FACES THE LINES AND PLANES FORM SEPARATE CLASSES AS SHOWN IN THE DIAGRAMS BY THE LOWER MARGINAL EXPLANATION OF THE LINES AND THE RIGHTHAND MARGINAL EXPLANATION OF THE PLANES I USE HERE AND ELSEWHERE  RAY TO DENOTE A LINE PASSING THROUGH A SINGLE NODE  AXIS TO DENOTE A LINE JOINING TWO NODES EDGEAS ABOVE TO DENOTE THE EDGE OF A BINODE ANY OTHER LINE IS A MERE LINE AN AXIS IS ALWAYS TORSAL OR OSCULAR WHEN IT IS TORSAL THE PLANE TOUCHING ALONG THE AXIS ONTAINS A THIRD LIE WHICH IS THE  TRANS VERSAL OF SUCH AXIS BUT A TRANSVERSAL MAY BE A MERE LINE A RAY OR AN AXIS IN THE CASE XVI 12 4C2 EACH TRANSVERSAL IS A TRANSVERSAL IN REGARD TO TWO AXES 23 IN THE GENERAL CASE I12 EACH OF THE 27 LINES IS AS ALREADY MENTIONED PART OF THE NODECOUPLE CURVE AND THE NODECOUPLE CURVE IS MADE UP OF THE 27 LINES AND IS THUS A CURVE OF THE ORDER 27 IN FACT EACH PLANE THROUGH A LINE MEETS THE CUBIC SURFACE IN THIS LINE AND IN A CONIC THE LINE AND CONIC MEET IN TWO POINTS AND THE PLANE THAT IS IN ANY PLANE THROUGH THE LINE IS THUS A DOUBLE TANGENT PLANE TOUCHING THE SURFACE AT THE TWO POINTS IN QUESTION THE LOCUS OF THE POINTS OF CONTACT THAT IS THE LINE ITSELF IS THUS PART OF THE NODECOUPLE CURVE BUT IN THE OTHER CASES II TO XXI CERTAIN OF THE LINES DO NOT BELONG TO THE NODECOUPLE CURVE THIS WILL BE EXAMINED IN DETAIL IN THE SEVERAL CASES RESPECTIVELY BUT I WISH TO SHOW HEREHOW IN A GENERAL WAY A LINE PASSING THROUGH A NODE SAY A NODAL RAY IS NOT PART OF THE NODECOUPLE CURVE TO FIX THE IDEAS CONSIDER THE SURFACE II12C2 THERE ARE HERE THROUGH C SIX LINES OR SAY RAYS ATTENDING TO ANY ONE OF THESE A PLANE THROUGH THE RAY MEETS THE SURFACE IN THE RAY ITSELF AND IN A CONIC THE RAY AND THE CONIC MEET AS BEFORE IN TWO POINTS ONE OF THEM BEING THE POINT 0 THE PLANE TOUCHES THE SURFACE AT THE OTHER POINT BUT IT DOES NOT TOUCH THE SURFACE AT C2 I AM NOT SURE AND I LEAVE IT AN OPEN QUESTION WHETHER WE OUGHT TO SAY THAT AT A NODE C2 THERE IS NO TANGENT PLANE OR TO SAY THAT ONLY THE TANGENT PLANES OF THE NODAL CONE ARE TANGENT PLANES OF THE SURFACE BUT AT ANY RATE AN ARBITRARY PLANE THROUGH C2 IS NOT A TANGENT PLANE THE PLANE THROUGH THE RAY IS ONLY A SINGLE TANGENT PLANE NOT A DOUBLE TANGENT PLANE AND THE RAY IS NOT PART OF THE NODECOUPLE CURVE WE SAY THAT A LINE OF THE SURFACE IS OR IS NOT  FACULTATIVE ACCORDING AS IT DOES OR DOES NOT FORM PART OF THE NODECOUPLE CURVE 238PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES AIS THE IFFERENT KINDS THEREOFF ARTICLE NOS 24 TO 26 24 A LINE JOINING TWO NODES IS AN AXIS SUCH A LINEIS ALWAYS A LINE AND IT IS A TORSAL OR OSCULAR LINE OF THE SURFACE BUT SOME FURTHER DISTINCTIONS ARE REQUISITE USING THE EXPRESSIONS IN THEIR STRICT SENSE CNICNODE C BINODE B AN AXIS IS A CCAXIS JOINING TWO CNICNODES OR IT IS A CBRAXIS JOINING A CNICNODE AND A BINODE OR IT IS A BBAXIS JOINING TWO BINODES A CCAXIS IS TORSAL THE TRANSVERSAL BEING A MERE LINE NOT A RAY THROUGH EITHER OF THE CNICNODES A CBAXIS IS TORSAL THE TRANSVERSAL BEING A RAY OF THE BINODE A BBAXIS IS OSCULAR THE DISTINCTION IS OF COURSE CARRIED THROUGH AS REGARDS THE HIGHER BIPLANAR NODES B4 B5 B6 AND THE UNIPLANAR NODES U6 U7 U8 THUS BB THE EDGE OF A BINODE B5 IS NOT AN AXIS AT ALL BUT B42C THE EDGE OF A BINODE B IS A CCAXIS B5BC THE EDGE OF A BINODE B 5IS A CBAXIS B63C THE EDGE OF A AXESVIZ THE EXAMINATION OF THE SEVERAL CASES SHOWS THAT IN THE COMPLETE INTERSECTION EACH CCAXIS PRESENTS ITSELF TWICE EACH CBAXIS 3 TIMES AND EACH BBAXIS 4 TIMES WE THUS SEE THAT A

THE PARAMETER 0 AND WHEN Q VARIES THIS CURVE SWEEPS OVER THE SURFACE THE ENVELOPE IN REGARD TO P OF THE POLAR PLANE OF A POINT OF THE SURFACE IS A TORSE THE RECIPROCAL OF THE CURVE 0 AND THE ENVELOPE OF THE TORSE IS THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IN PARTICULAR THE CURVE 0 MAY BE THE PLANE SECTION BY ANY PLANE THROUGH A FIXED LINE SAY BY THE PLANE P QO0 THE SECTION IS A CUBIC CURVE THE RECIPROCAL IS A SEXTIC CONE HAVING ITS VERTEX IN A FIXED LINE THE RECI PROCAL OF THE LINE P 0 Q 0 AND THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS THUS OBTAINED AS THE ENVE LOPE OF THIS CONE ASSUMING THAT THE EQUATION OF THE SEXTIC

FUNCTION OF P Q 30 WITH A VARIATION THIS PROCESS IS A CONVENIENT ONE FOR OBTAINING THE RECIPROCAL OF A CUBIC SURFACE WE TAKE THE FIXED LINE TO BE ONE OF THE LINES ON THE CUBIC SURFACE THE CURVE 0 IS THEN A CONIC ITS RECIPROCAL IS A QUADRICONE AND THE ENVELOPE OF THIS QUADRI CONE IS THE REQUIRED RECIPROCAL SURFACE THIS IS REALLY WHAT SCHLFIFLI DOES BUT THE PROCESS IS NOT EXPLAINED IN THE SEVERAL INSTANCES IN WHICH HE OBTAINS THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE BY MEANS OF A BINARY FUNCTION I REMARK THAT IT WOULD BE VERY INSTRUCTIVE FOR EACH CASE OF SURFACE TO TAKE THE VARIABLE PLANE SUCCESSIVELY THROUGH THE SEVERAL KINDS OF LINES ON THE PARTICULAR SURFACE THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE WOULD THUS BE OBTAINED UNDER DIFFERENT FORMS PUTTING IN EVIDENCE THE RELATION TO THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE OF THE FIXED LINE MADE USE OF BUT THIS IS AN INVESTIGATION WHICH I DO NOT ENTER UPON I ADOPT IN EACH CASE SCHLAFLIS PROCESS WITHOUT EXPLANATION AND MERELY WRITE DOWN THE TERNARY OR AS THE CASE MAY BE BINARY FUNCTION BY MEANS OF WHICH THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS OBTAINED 31 IT IS TO BE MENTIONED THAT THERE IS A RECIPROCAL PROCESS OF OBTAINING THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE WE MAY IMAGINE TOUCHING THE CUBIC SURFACE ALONG ANY CURVE A SERIES OF PLANES THAT IS A TORSE CIRCUMSCRIBED ABOUT THE SURFACE AD THE EQUATION WHEREOF CONTAINS A VARIABLE PARAMETER D THE RECIPROCAL FIGURE IS A CURVE THE EQUATIONS WHEREOF CONTAIN THE PARAMETER 0 THE LOCUS OF THIS CURVE IS THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE THAT IS THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS OBTAINED BY ELIMINATING D FROM THE EQUATIONS OF THE CURVE IN PARTICULAR LET THE TORSE BE THE CIRCUMSCRIBED CONE HAVING ITS VERTEX AT ANY POINT OF A FIXED LINE THE RECIPROCAL FIGURE IS THEN A PLANE CURVE THE PLANE OF WHICH PASSES THROUGH THE LINE WHICH IS THE RECIPROCAL OF THE FIXED LINE IT IS MOREOVER CLEAR THAT IF THE POSITION OF THE VERTEX ON THE FIXED LINE BE DETERMINED BY THE PARAMETER 0 LISNEARLY FOR INSTANCE IF THE VERTEX BE GIVEN AS THE INTERSECTION OF THE FIXED LINE BY A PLANE P Q0 THEN THE EQUATION OF THE PLANE OF THE CURVE WILL BE OF THE FORM P Q CONTAINING THE PARAMETER 0 LINEARLY THE OTHER EQUATION OF THE PLANE CURVE WILL CONTAIN 0 RATIONALLY AND THE ELIMINATION WILL BE AT ONCE EFFECTED BY SUBSTITUTING IN THIS OTHER EQUATION FOR 0 ITS VALUE P Q AND OBSERVE MOREOVER THAT IF THE FIXED LINE BE A LINE ON THE CUBIC SURFACE THEN THE CONE IS A QUADRICONE HAVING FOR ITS RECIPROCAL A CONIC THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS THUS GIVEN AS THE LOCUS OF A VARIABLE CONIC THE PLANE OF MDCCCLXIX 2

THE INVESTIGATION IN DETAIL 32 THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS FOUND BY EQUATING TO ZERO THE DISCRIMI NANT OF A TERNARY OR A BINARY FUNCTION VIZ THIS IS A TERNARY CUBIC OR A BINARY QUARTIC CUBIC OR QUADRIC THE EQUATION AS GIVEN IN THE FORM DISCT 0 CONTAINS A FACTOR WHICH FOR THE ADOPTED FORMS OF EQUATIONS IS ALWAYS A POWER OR PRODUCT OF POWERS OF W Z XT KNOWN APRIORI AND WHICH IS THROWN OUT WITHOUT DIFFICULTY THE EQUATION BEING THEREBY REDUCED TO THE PROPER ORDER THERE IS THE SINGULAR ADVANTAGE THAT THE PROCESS PUTS IN EVIDENCE THE CUSPIDAL CURVE OF THE RESULTING RECIPROCAL SURFACE VIZ FOR A TERNARY CUBIC THE FORM OBTAINED IS S3T 0 AND FOR A BINARY QUARTIC IT IS THE EQUIVALENT FORM I327J20O BUT FOR THE FACTOR THROWN OUT AS JUST MENTIONED WE SHOULD HAVE SIMPLY SO T0 OR AS THE CASE MAY BE I0 J0 FOR EQUATIONS OF THE CUSPIDAL CURVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE FACTOR OCCASIONS HOWEVER A MODIFICATION VIZ THE INTERSECTION OF THE TWO SURFACES IS NOT AN INDECOMPOSABLE CURVE AND THE CUSPIDAL CURVE IS IN MOST CASES NOT THE COMPLETE INTERSECTION BUT A PARTIAL INTERSECTION OF THE TWO SURFACES IN SEVERAL CASES IT THUS HAPPENS THAT THE CUSPIDAL CURVE IS OBTAINED AS A CURVE I P  0 WITHOUT OR WITH FURTHER SPECIALITY SIMILARLY WHEN THE EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE IS OBTAINED BY MEANS OF A BINARY CUBIC IF THE COEFFICIENTS HEREOF FUNCTIONS OF COURSE OF THE COORDINATES X Y Z

EQUATION OF THE RECIPROCAL SURFACE ITHESE ANA LYTICAL EXPRESSIONS HAVE NO PRESENT APPLICATION AND SO IN SOME OF THE NEXT FOLLOWING SECTIONS NO APPLICATION IS MADE OF THE ANALYTICAL EXPRESSIONS OF THE

j100588,Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London,108997,A Memoir on Cubic Surfaces,i207024, 231  VII A Memoir on Cubic Surfaces By Professor CAYLEY FS Received November 12 1868Read January 14 1869 THE present Memoir is based upon and is in a measure supplementary to that by Pro fessor SCHLXPLI  On the Distribution of Surfaces of the Third Order into Species in reference to the presence or absence of Singular Points and the reality of their Lines Phil Trans vol cliii 1863 pp 193241 But the object of the Memoir is different I disregard altogethler the ultimate division depending on the reality of the lines attend ing only to the division into twentytwo or as I prefer to reckon it twentythree cases depending on the nature of the singularities And I attend to the question very much on account of the light to be obtained in reference to the theory of Reciprocal Surfaces The memoir referred to furnishes in fact a store of materials for this purpose inasmuch as it gives partially or completely developed the equations in planecoordinates of the several cases of cubic surfaces or what is the same thing the equations in pointcoor dinates of the several surfaces orders 12 to 3 reciprocal to these repectively I found by examination of the several cases that an extension was required of Dr SALMONS theory of Reciprocal Surfaces in order to make it applicable to the present subject and the preceding  Memoir on the Theory of Reciprocal Surfaces  was written in connexion with these investigations on Cubic Surfaces The latter part of the Memoir is divided into sections headed thus Section 112 equation X Y Z W30  c referring to the several cases of the cubic surface but the paragraphs are numbered continuously through the Memoir The twentythree Cases of

2 B3 B3 B B a biplanar node diminishing as the case may be the class by 3 4 5 or 6 and U6 U7 U8 a uni planar node diminishing as the case may be the class by 6 7 or 8 The affixed expla nation which I shall usually retain in connexion witli the Roman number shows there fore in each case what the class is and also the singularities which cause the reduction thus XIII 12B32C2 indicates that there is a biplanar node B3 diminishing the class by 3 and two conicnodes C0 each diminishing the class by 2 and thus that the class is 12322 5 As regards the cases XXII and XXIII these are surfaces having a nodal right line and are consequently scrolls each of the class 3 viz XXII is the scroll S1 1 having a simple directrix right line distinct from the nodal line and XXIII is the scroll S1 1 having a simple directrix right line coincident with the nodal line see as to this my  Second Memoir on Skew Surfaces otherwise Scrolls Phil Trans vol cliv 1864 pp 559577 3 The nature of the points C 33 B B  36 U7 U requires to be explained C02 is a conicnode where instead of the tangent plane we have a proper quadric cone BB3 B B or B is a biplanarnode where the quadric cone becomes a planepair two distinct planes the two planes are called the biplanes and their line of intersec tion is the edge In B3 the edge is not a line on the surfacein the other cases it is this implies that the surface is touched along the edge by a plane viz in B4 B the edge is torsal in B it is oscular 232PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES In B4 the tangent plane is distinct from each of the biplanes In B the tangent plane coincides with one of the biplanes we have thus an ordinary biplane and a torsal biplane In B6 the tangent plane coinciding with one of the biplanes becomes oscular we have thus an ordinary biplane and an oscular biplane UU6 U7 or U8 is a uniplanarnode where the quadric cone becomes a coincident planepair say the plane is the uniplane It is to be observed that there is not in this case any edge The uniplane meets the cubic surface in three lines or say rays passing through the uniplanarnode viz In U6 the rays are three distinct lines In U7 two of them coincide In U8 they all three coincide 4 To connect these singular points with the theory of the preceding Memoir it is to be observed that they aie respectively equivalent to a certain number of the cnicnodes CC2 and binodes BB viz we have C2 C B3 B B42C B C B JB63C 1U6 3C U72C B U8 C2B 5 I take the opportunity of remarking that although the expressions cnicnode and binode properly refer to the simple singularities C and B yet as CC C2 is properly spoken of as a cnicnode and we may using the term binode as an abbreviation for biplanarnode speak of any of the singularities B B4 B B6 as a binode Thus the surface X12B4C has a binode B4 and a cnicnode C2 although theoretically the binode B4 is equivalent to two cnicnodes and the surface belongs to those with three cnicnodes or for which C3 I use also the expression unode for shortness instead of uniplanarnode to denote any of the singularities U6 U7 Us 6 The foregoing equations substantially the same as SCHLXFLIS are canonical forms the reduction of the equation of any case of surface to the above form is not always obvious It would appear that each equation is from its simplicity in the form best adapted to the separate discussion of the surface to which it belongs there is the disad vantage that the equations do not always when from the geometrical connexion of the sur faces they ought to do so lead the one to the other for instance V12B4 incldes VII12 B5 but we cannot from the equation WXZ XZYaX2X2 bZ2 of the former pass to the equation WXZY2ZYXXX30 of the latter This would be a serious imperfection if the object were to form a theory of the quaternary function MDCCCLXIX 2 K 233PROFESSOR COAYLE ON CUBIC SUirFAES X Y Z W3 but the equations are in the present Memoir used only as means to an end the establishment of the geometrical theory of the surfaces to which they respec tively belong and the imperfection is not material 7 IE have used the capital letters X Y Z W in place of SC11LXFLIS X Y Z w reserving these in place of his p q r s for planecoordinates of the cubic surfaces or what is the same thing pointcoordinates of the reciprocal surfaces but I have in several cases interchanged the coordinates X Y Z W so that they do not im this order correspond to SCHLiPrLIS x y  w this has been done so as to obtain a greater uni formity in the representation of the surfaces To explain this let A B C D be the vertices of the tetrahedron formed by the coordinate planes AYZW BZWX CWXY DXYZ the coordinate planes have been chosen so that determinate vertices of the tetrahedron shall correspond to determinate singularities of the surface 8 Consider first thel surfaces which have no nodes B or U It is clear that the nodes C2 might have been taken at any vertices whatever of the tetrahedron they are taken thus there is always a node C2 at D when there is a second node C2 this is at C the third one is at A and the fourth at B 9 Consider next the surfaces which have a binode B B4 B5 or B6 this is taken to be at D and the biplanes to be XO Z0 the edge being therefore IDB viz in B5 or B6 where the distinction arises X 0 is the ordinary biplane Z0 the torsal or as the case may be oscular biplane If there is a second node this of necessity lies in an ordinary biplane it may be and is taken to be in the biplane X0 at C I suppose for a moment that this is a node C2 It is only when the binode is B3 or B4 that there can be a third node for it is only in these cases that there is a second ordinary biplane Z0  but in these cases respectively the third node a C2 may be and is taken to be in the biplane Z  0 at A 10 The only case of two binodes is when each is a B3 Here the first is as above at D its biplanes being X0O Z0 and the second is as above in the biplane XO at C the biplanes thereof are then X 0 which is thus a biplane common to the two binodes or say a common biplane and a remaining biplane which may be and is taken to be W 0 If there is a third node this may be either C2 or B3 but it will in either case lie in the biplane Z0 of the first binode and also in the biplane W0 of the second binode that is in the line BA and it may be and is taken to be at A if a binode then its biplanes are of necessity Z0 W0 and the plane YO will be the plane through the three binodes D C A 11 If there is a unode then this may be and is taken to be at D and its uniplane may be taken to be X0 in the surface XII 12U6 the uniplane is however taken to be XYZO0 There is never besides the unode any other node 12 The result is that the nodes in the order of their speciality are in the equations taken to be at D C A B respectively and that except in the case III 12 B3 the biplanes of the first binode are X 0 Z 0 for a binode B5 or B6 X 0 being the ordinary biplane Z0 the special biplane those of the second binode X0 W0O  In the ease however of a single B3 III123B the biplanes are taken to be XYZO ZXmYnZ 0 234EPROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC BTRFACES 235 those of the third binode Zo W0 and that except in t ase 12  the uniplane is X0 For example in the surface XVII122B3C as represented by its equation WXZ YZX0 we have a B3 at D the biplanes being X0 Z 0 a B3 at C the biplanes being X0 W0 therefore XO the common biplane and a C2 at A 13 It will be convenient anticipations contained in the present Memoir to give at once the following Table of Singularities the several symbols have of course the significations

19 14 In the several cases I to XXI we have a cubic surface n 3 with singular points C and B but without singular lines The section by an arbitrary plane is thus a curve order n 3 that is a cubic curve without nodes or cusps and therefore of the class a 6 having 0 double tangents and 9 inflexions The tangent cone with an arbitrary point as vertex is a cone of the order a6 having in the case I12 50 nodal lines and z6 cuspidal lines but with in the several other cases C nodal lines and B cuspidal lines or rather singular lines tantamount to C double lines and B cuspidal lines the class of the cone or order of the reciprocal surface is thus 6520 C36B122B3C 15 In the general case I12 there are on the cubic surface 27 lines lying by 3s in 45 planes these 27 lines constitute the nodecouple curve of the order 27 and the nodecouple torse consists of the pencils of planes through these lines respectively being thus of the class  627 the 45 planes are triple tangent planes of the nodecouple torse which has thus t45 triple tangent planes But in the other cases it is only certain of the 27 lines say the facultative lines as will be explained which constitute the nodecouple curve of the order e the pencils of planes through these lines constitute the nodecouple torse of the class b the t planes each containing three facultative lines are the triple tangent planes of the nodecouple torse Or if as is somewhat more con venient we refer the numbers b t to the reciprocal surface then the lines reciprocals of the facultative lines constitute the nodal curve of the order b and the points t each containing three of these lines are the triple points of the nodal curve Inasmuch as the nodal curve consists of right lines the number kI of its apparent double points is given by the formula 2kb 2 61 and comparing with the formula 6Y2b2k3y6t we have q3y0 that is 0 q the class of the nodal curve and also y 0 16 In the general case I12 the spinode curve is the complete intersection of the cubic surface by the Hessian surface of the order 4 and it is thus of the order do12 but in the other cases the complete intersection consists of the spinode curve together with certain right lines not belonging to the curve and the spinode curve is of an order a less than 12 this will be further explained and the reduction accounted for see post Nos 24 et seq 17 Again in the general case 112 each of the 27 lines is a double tangent of the spinode curve and the tangent planes of the surface at the points of contact are common tangent planes of the spinode torse and the nodecouple torse stationary planes of the spinode torse or we have 3P254 In the other cases however instead of the 27 lines we must take only the facultative lines each of which is or is not a double or a sine tangent of the spinode curve and the tangent planes of the surface at the points of contact are the common tangent planes as abovethat is the number of contacts gives 3 not in general2 236PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES 18 There are not except as above any common tangent planes of the two torses that is not only yr0 as already mentioned but also i0 I do not at present account a priori for the values O16 8 and 16 which present themselves in the Table The cubic surface cannot have a plane of conic contact and we have thus in every case C0 but the value of B is not in every case  0 19 In what precedes we see how a discussion of the equation of the cubic surface should in the several cases respectively lead to the values b t  Y flj  B and how in the reciprocal surface the nodal curve of the order b is known by means of the facultative lines of the original cubic surface The cuspidal curve c might also be obtained as the reciprocal of the spinodetorse but this would in general be a laborious process and it is the less necessary inasmuch as the equation of the reciprocal surface is in each case obtained in a form putting in evidence the cuspidal curve The Lines and Planes of a Cubic Surface Facultative Lines Explanation of Diagrams Article Nos 20 to 23 20 In the general surface 112 we have 27 lines and 45 tripletangent planes or say simply planes through each line pass 5 planes in each plane lie 3 lines For the surfaces II to XXI the present considerations do not of course apply to the Scrolls several of the lines come to coincide with each other and several of the planes also come to coincide with each other but the number of the lines is always reckoned as 27 and that of the planes as 45 If we attend to the distinct lines and the distinct planes each line has a multiplicity and the sum of these is 27 and so each plane has a mul tiplicity and the sum of these is45 Again attending to a particular line in a par ticular plane the line has a frequency 1 2 or 3 that is it represents 1 2 or 3 of the 3 lines in the plane this is in fact the distinction of a scrolar torsal or oscular line and similarly the plane has a frequency 1 2 3 4 or 5 according to the number which it represents of the 5 planes through the line It requires only a little consideration to perceive that the multiplicity of the plane into its frequency in regard to the line is equal to the multiplicity of the line into its frequency in regard to the plane Observe further that if M be the multiplicity of the plane then considering it in regard to the lines con tained therein we get the products M M M 2M M or 3M according as the three lines are or are not distinct but that the sum of the products is always 3M and that in regard to all the planes the total sum is 3 X 45  135 And so if M be the multipli city of the line then considering it in regard to the planes which pass through it we get the products M M M M M 2M M M M    5M as the case may be but that the sum of the products is 5M and that in regard to all the lines the sum is 5X 27 135 as before 21 The mode of coincidence of the lines and planes and the several distinct lines and planes which are situate in or pass through the several distinct planes and lines respec tively are shown in the annexed diagrams I to XXI  the multiplicity of each line  See the commencements of the several sections 2373PROFESSORR iCAYLEY OiN CUBIC SURFACES appears by the upper marginal line and that of each plane by the lefthand marginal column thus in diagram I 27 X 127 and 45 X 145 1 is te mutipliciy ofeach line and it is also faclethe mltiplici eachpne the frequencies of a line and plane in egard to each other appear by the dots in the square opposite to the line and plane in question these being read for the frequency of the line vertically and for the frequency of the plane horizontally thus  indicates that the frequency of the line is 3 and the frequency of the plane is 2 There should be and are in every line of the diagram 3 dots and in every column of the diagram 5 dots a symbol m being read as just explained 2 dots in the line 3 dots in the column 22 For the urface 1eI12 there is of course no distinction between the lines but these form only a single class and the like for the planes but for the other sur faces the lines and planes form separate classes as shown in the diagrams by the lower marginal explanation of the lines and the righthand marginal explanation of the planes I use here and elsewhere  ray to denote a line passing through a single node  axis to denote a line joining two nodes edgeas above to denote the edge of a binode any other line is a mere line An axis is always torsal or oscular when it is torsal the plane touching along the axis ontains a third lie which is the  trans versal of such axis but a transversal may be a mere line a ray or an axis in the case XVI 12 4C2 each transversal is a transversal in regard to two axes 23 In the general case I12 each of the 27 lines is as already mentioned part of the nodecouple curve and the nodecouple curve is made up of the 27 lines and is thus a curve of the order 27 In fact each plane through a line meets the cubic surface in this line and in a conic the line and conic meet in two points and the plane that is in any plane through the line is thus a double tangent plane touching the surface at the two points in question the locus of the points of contact that is the line itself is thus part of the nodecouple curve But in the other cases II to XXI certain of the lines do not belong to the nodecouple curve this will be examined in detail in the several cases respectively but I wish to show herehow in a general way a line passing through a node say a nodal ray is not part of the nodecouple curve To fix the ideas consider the surface II12C2 there are here through C six lines or say rays attending to any one of these a plane through the ray meets the surface in the ray itself and in a conic the ray and the conic meet as before in two points one of them being the point 0 the plane touches the surface at the other point but it does not touch the surface at C2 I am not sure and I leave it an open question whether we ought to say that at a node C2 there is no tangent plane or to say that only the tangent planes of the nodal cone are tangent planes of the surface but at any rate an arbitrary plane through C2 is not a tangent plane The plane through the ray is only a single tangent plane not a double tangent plane and the ray is not part of the nodecouple curve We say that a line of the surface is or is not  facultative according as it does or does not form part of the nodecouple curve 238PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES Ais the ifferent kinds thereoff Article Nos 24 to 26 24 A line joining two nodes is an axis such a lineis always a line and it is a torsal or oscular line of the surface But some further distinctions are requisite using the expressions in their strict sense cnicnode C binode B an axis is a CCaxis joining two cnicnodes or it is a CBRaxis joining a cnicnode and a binode or it is a BBaxis joining two binodes A CCaxis is torsal the transversal being a mere line not a ray through either of the cnicnodes a CBaxis is torsal the transversal being a ray of the binode a BBaxis is oscular The distinction is of course carried through as regards the higher biplanar nodes B4 B5 B6 and the uniplanar nodes U6 U7 U8 thus BB the edge of a binode B5 is not an axis at all but B42C the edge of a binode B is a CCaxis B5BC the edge of a binode B 5is a CBaxis B63C the edge of a axesviz the examination of the several cases shows that in the complete intersection each CCaxis presents itself twice each CBaxis 3 times and each BBaxis 4 times We thus see that a CCaxis or rather the torsal plane along such axis is the pinchplane or singularity j  the CBaxis or rather the torsal plane along such axis the close plane or singularity z1 and the BBaxis or oscular plane along such axis the bitrope or singularity Bl for a cubic surfacintersecin e with singular lines the expression of being in fact 12  2j  3 413 There are however some cases requiring explanation complete intersection is made up of the edge4 times an ofeean octic curve the con ideration of the examinaton of the s hows however thate edge taken once is really part of the spinode curve viz that twicehis curve is made up of the edge taken once and of the the spinode curve 26 singula remark in furthe x ithhe x o ththe torsal plane veral sections in showing the close complete intersection of th cubic surface with thesingular liHes sian is made up I have not in referred to the axes in the above precise significations thucases requiring explanationhe binode B ca is CVIII12B and the edge is thus a CBaxis while the axis B5C2 is a CBaxis omp a CCaxis ection1 i 2 ade u  The complete i ntersection should t herefore con sist of the spinode curve viz edge as a curve axis 3 times edge axis as a Baxis of a CCaxis 2curve3 5 times it is in the section stated in perfect consistency herewith but wersechout the full explanation that the intersection is made up of the axis 5 times the edge 4 times and a cubic curvewhich cubic curve together with the edge once constitutes the spinode curve and so in other casesveral this explanation will I think rem ove all difficulty remove all difficulVty 239PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES On the Determination of the Beci2rocal Equation Article Nos 27 to 32 27 Consider in general the cubic surface XX Y Z W30 and in connexion therewith the equation X YyZzWw O which regarding therein X Y Z Was current coordinates and x y z w as constants is the equation of a plane If from the two equations we eliminate one of the coordinates for instance W we obtain Xw Yw Zw XxYyZz30 which X Y Z being current coordinates7is obviously the equation of the cone vertex XO Y0 Z0 which stands on the section of the cubic surface by the plane Equating to zero the discriminant of this function in regard to X Y Z we express that the cone has a nodal line that is that the section has a node or what is the same thing that the plane xXyYzZwWO is a tangent plane of the cubic surface and we thus by the process in fact obtain the equation of the cubic surface in the reci procal or plane coordinates x y z w Consider in the same equation x y z w as current coordinates X Y Z as given parameters the equation represents a system of three planes viz these are the planes xXyYzZwWO where W has the three values given by the equation XX Y Z W3 0 or what is the same thing X Y Z W are the coordinates of any one of the three points of intersection of the cubic surface x y z by the line YZ X Y Z W belongs to a point on the surface and xXyYzZwW0 is the polar plane of this point in regard to a quadric surface X2Y2Z2W2 0 the equation Xw Yw Zw XxYyzz30 is thus the equation of a system of 3 planes the polar planes of three points of the cubic surface which three points lie on an arbitrary line through the point xO yO z0 In equating to zero the discriminant in regard to X Y Z we find the envelope of the system of three planes or say of a plane the polar plane of an arbitrary point on the cubic surfaceor we have the equation of the reciprocal surface being as is known the same thing as the equation of the cubic surface in the reciprocal or plane coordinates x y z w In what precedes we have the explanation of an ordinary process of finding the equation of the reciprocal surface this equation being thereby given by equating to zero the discriminant of a function X Y Z3 that is of a ternary cubic function 28 The process as last explained is a special one viz the position of a point on the surface is determined by means of certain two parameters the ratios X Y Z which fix the position of the line joining this point with the point x0 yO zO More generally we may consider the position of the point as determined by means of any two parameters the equation of the polar plane then contains the two parameters and by taking the envelope in regard to the two parameters considered as variable we have the equation of the reciprocal surface 29 But let the parameters say 0 p be regarded as varying successively if p alone 240PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES 241 vary we have on the surface a curve 0 the equation whereof contains the parameter 0 and when Q varies this curve sweeps over the surface The envelope in regard to p of the polar plane of a point of the surface is a torse the reciprocal of the curve 0 and the envelope of the torse is the reciprocal surface In particular the curve 0 may be the plane section by any plane through a fixed line say by the plane P QO0 the section is a cubic curve the reciprocal is a sextic cone having its vertex in a fixed line the reci procal of the line P 0 Q 0 and the reciprocal surface is thus obtained as the enve lope of this cone assuming that the equation of the sextic cone has been obtained this is an equation of a certain order in the parameter 0 or writing aP Q we obtain the equation of the reciprocal surface by equating to zero the discriminant of a binary function of P Q 30 With a variation this process is a convenient one for obtaining the reciprocal of a cubic surface we take the fixed line to be one of the lines on the cubic surface the curve 0 is then a conic its reciprocal is a quadricone and the envelope of this quadri cone is the required reciprocal surface This is really what SCHLFiFLI does but the process is not explained in the several instances in which he obtains the equation of the reciprocal surface by means of a binary function I remark that it would be very instructive for each case of surface to take the variable plane successively through the several kinds of lines on the particular surface the equation of the reciprocal surface would thus be obtained under different forms putting in evidence the relation to the reciprocal surface of the fixed line made use of But this is an investigation which I do not enter upon I adopt in each case SCHLAFLIS process without explanation and merely write down the ternary or as the case may be binary function by means of which the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained 31 It is to be mentioned that there is a reciprocal process of obtaining the equation of the reciprocal surface we may imagine touching the cubic surface along any curve a series of planes that is a torse circumscribed about the surface ad the equation whereof contains a variable parameter d the reciprocal figure is a curve the equations whereof contain the parameter 0 the locus of this curve is the reciprocal surface that is the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained by eliminating d from the equations of the curve In particular let the torse be the circumscribed cone having its vertex at any point of a fixed line the reciprocal figure is then a plane curve the plane of which passes through the line which is the reciprocal of the fixed line it is moreover clear that if the position of the vertex on the fixed line be determined by the parameter 0 lisnearly for instance if the vertex be given as the intersection of the fixed line by a plane P Q0 then the equation of the plane of the curve will be of the form P Q containing the parameter 0 linearly the other equation of the plane curve will contain 0 rationally and the elimination will be at once effected by substituting in this other equation for 0 its value P Q And observe moreover that if the fixed line be a line on the cubic surface then the cone is a quadricone having for its reciprocal a conic the reciprocal surface is thus given as the locus of a variable conic the plane of MDCCCLXIX 2 LPROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES whicl always passes through a fixed line there are thus on the reciprocal surface series of such conics It would be very instructive and interesting to carry out the investigation in detail 32 The equation of the reciprocal surface is found by equating to zero the discrimi nant of a ternary or a binary function viz this is a ternary cubic or a binary quartic cubic or quadric The equation as given in the form disct 0 contains a factor which for the adopted forms of equations is always a power or product of powers of w z xt known apriori and which is thrown out without difficulty the equation being thereby reduced to the proper order There is the singular advantage that the process puts in evidence the cuspidal curve of the resulting reciprocal surface viz for a ternary cubic the form obtained is S3T 0 and for a binary quartic it is the equivalent form I327J20O but for the factor thrown out as just mentioned we should have simply SO T0 or as the case may be I0 J0 for equations of the cuspidal curve the existence of the factor occasions however a modification viz the intersection of the two surfaces is not an indecomposable curve and the cuspidal curve is in most cases not the complete intersection but a partial intersection of the two surfaces In several cases it thus happens that the cuspidal curve is obtained as a curve i p  0 without or with further speciality Similarly when the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained by means of a binary cubic if the coefficients hereof functions of course of the coordinates x y z w be A B C D then the surface is ADBC2 4AC B2BD C2  0 having the cuspidal curve B B D 0 subject however to modification in the case of a thrown out factor Explanation as to the Sections of the Mlemoir Article Nos 33  34 33 As regards the following Sections I to XXIII it is to be observed that for the general surface I12 I do not attempt to form the equation of the reciprocal surface and in some of the other cases II12C2 c the equation of the reciprocal surface is either not obtained in a completely developed form or it is too complicated to allow of its being dealt with for instance so as to put in evidence the nodal curve of the surface Portions of the theory given in the latter sections are consequently omitted in the earlier ones and in particular in the Section I there is given only the diagram of the 27 lines and the 45 planes with however developments as to notation and otherwise which have no place in the subsequent sections and with the analytical expressions for the several lines  In some easy cases for instance XVI12 4C the equation of the reciprocal surface is obtained other wise by a direct elimination t The factor is in general a power or product of powers of the linear functions which equated to zero give the equations of the planes reciprocal to the several nodes of the surface 242PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUYBIC SUTRFACES and planes although from the want of the equation of the reciprocal surface ithese ana lytical expressions have no present application And so in some of the next following sections no application is made of the analytical expressions of the lines and planes 34 I call to mind that if a line be given as the intersection of the two planes AXBYCZ DWO0 AXBYCZDW 0 then the six coordinates of the line are a  c g h ADAD BDBD CDCD BCBC CACA ABAB and that in terms of its six coordinates the line is given as the common intersection of the four planes   h7 g a XxYZ W0 h  f 6 g f  c I 6  c and that reciprocating as usual in regard to X2Y2Z2W20 the coordinates of the reciprocal line are f g h a b c that is this is the common intersection of the four planes   c b  f y z w0 c  a g b  a  h f g h  It is in some cases more convenient to consider a line as determined as the intersection of two planes rather than by means of its six coordinates thus for instance to speak of the line XO0 YO rather than of the line 0  0 0 1 0 0 and in some of the sec tions I have preferred not to give the expressions of the six coordinates of the several lines  I12 Equation X Y Z W30 Article Nos 35 to 46 35 There is in the system of the 27 lines and the 45 planes a complicated and many sided symmetry which precludes the existence of any unique notation the notation can only be obtained by starting from some arrangement which is not unique but one of a system of several like arrangements The notation employed in my original paper On the Simple Tangent Planes of Surfaces of the Third Order Camb and Dub Math Journ vol iv 1849 pp 118132 and which is shown in the right hand and lower margins of the diagram starts from such an arrangement but it is so complicated that it can hardly be considered as at all putting in evidence the relations of the lines and planes that of Dr HART SALMON  On the Triple Tangent Planes of a Surface of the Third Order same volume pp 252260 depending on an arrangement of the 27 lines according to a cube of 3 each way is a singularly elegant one and will be presently reproduced 2 L2 243PROFESSOR CAYLEY ON CUBIC SURFACES 36 But the most convenient one is SCHLAFLIS starting from a doublesixer viz we can and that in 36 different ways select out of the 27 lines two systems each of six lines such that no two lines of the same system intersect but that each line of the one system intersects all but the corresponding line of the other system or say if the lines are 1 2 3 4 5 6 1 2 31 4 51 6 then these have the thirty intersections 1 2 3 4 51 6 2 3  0  0 4  5  Any two lines such as 1 2 lie in a plane which may be called 12 similarly the lines 1 2 lie in a plane which may be called 12 these two planes meet in a line 12 and any three lines such as 12 34 56 meet in pairs lying in a plane 12 34 56 We

To see this observe that the lastmentioned surfaces have in common the line X0 Z0 which is on the first surface a torsal line equation in vicinity being Z  X2 and on the second surface a triple line equations in vicinity being ZX2 and XYZ3 But ZY X2 touches ZX2 and the line counts thus 22z 4 times 107 I say that the complete intersection is the line X0 Z0 three times together with a spinode curve made up of this same line once and of the curve of the eighth order and that thus d9 The discussion of the reciprocal surface in fact shows that the reciprocal of the edge is a singular line thereof counting once as a nodal and twice as a cuspidal line thereof the cuspidal tangent planes are the reciprocals of the several points of the edge and the edge is thus part of the spinode curve The reasoning may appear to show that the edge should be counted twice but it must be counted once only making the order 9 as mentioned 108 I find that the octic component of the spinode curve is a unicursal curve the equations of which may be written X Y Z W 162 401605 1603 584160s the values of 0 at the binode B are 600 o  and we thus obtain in the neigh bourhood thereof the two branches T Z2

have 1608804160250 160516 4 4 0 that is 202 124d4 4d250 4d202120 so that the line touches at the two points given by 2021 0 and similarly the other line touches at the two points given by 2021 0 The edge X0 Z0 has apparently a higher contact with the spinode octic viz the equations X0 Z0 are satisfied by 00 twice d o0 five times but it must be reckoned only as a double tangent Hence 32 222 6

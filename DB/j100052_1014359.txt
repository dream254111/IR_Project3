Duties on Imports in American Bottoms By ABRAHAM BERGLUND United States Tariff Commission ISCRIMINATORY duties on im ports carried in American ves sels have been a feature of our tariff legislation from the establishment in 1789 of a national policy governing foreign trade to the present time During much of this period such duties have for the most part been rendered inoperative by reciprocal treaties with practically all the commercial countries of the world mutually exempting from such discrimination the goods carried in the vessels of the contracting nations or by provisions in the laws themselves excepting from their enforcement arti cles imported in the ships of countries levying no discriminatory rates against goods carried to their ports in Ameri can bottoms The Merchant Marine Act recently passed by Congress and signed by the President provides for the termination of treaties or conven tions which restrict the right of the United States to impose discriminatory duties in favor of imports entering this country in American vessels The evident purpose of this enactment is to encourage trade in American bottoms as a means of protecting and enlarging our mercantile marine While discriminatory legislation of this character avowedly aims at the establishment and upbuilding of a na tional mercantile marine its ultimate object is the development of foreign commerce The belief that trade fol lows the flag and that the vessels flying the flag of a country are agents in the development of its commerce is a popu lar and deepseated one and finds pretty general expression in the commercial policies of the leading countries of the world today It is however in large measure a survival of a period when the association of a national or com munal shipping organization with the development of foreign trade was nec essarily closer than at the present time and when the separation of the func tions of common carrier from those of purely mercantile operation had not gone so far as they have today In the Middle Ages the active trade of such commercial cities as Venice and Genoa and of the towns of the Hansea tic League was closely connected with their shipping policies Thus at Venice 1 In mediaeval commerce active trade signi fied the carriage of goods to foreign lands and the establishment there of commercial agencies It implied the control of the transportation of the articles of commerce to such countries Where goods were carried by foreigners to ones city or country and commercial transactions carried out by foreign agencies the trade was characterized as passive Thetrade of Venice for example with Constantinople Beirut Alex andria and northwestern Europe was activeie the articles of commerce were carried to and from these places in Venetian galleys and con tracts made through Venetian agents at these ports or regions The overland trade of Venice with Germany was mainly passive as the German brought his goods to the city and carried on his transactions at the Fondaco dei Tedeschi 185THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY from about 1300 to 1500 A D the sail ing of the Flanders galleys was strictly regulated by the Venetian senate Separate voyages were as a rule pro hibited This regulation was practiced in the interest of safety both as a pro tection from piracy and as a means of mutual help in case of accident It was also a feature of the politics of a community whose economic basis was foreign trade The galleys that carried the articles of commerce were as much a part of the citys trading operations as was the sale of the articles them selves With the growth of the large com mercial companies of the fifteenth six teenth and seventeenth centuries in England France and the Netherlands the close association of shipping and foreign trade persisted largely because vessel operation and commerce were carried on by the same people The merchants belonging to such organiza tions as the Eastland Company the Merchant Adventurers the Levant Company and the various East India companies either individually or through these organizations owned the vessels that carried their goods It was on account of this association as well as on account of the growth of economic nationalism or mercantilism that the Navigation Acts became such a prom inent feature of the commercial policy of England in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries These acts 1 It should be remembered in this connection that most of these commercial concerns began as regulated companies ie as associations of individuals who had been granted charters by their governments giving them as an association certain excltsive privileges for carrying on trade between the home country and certain foreign lands The members of these associations how ever carried on their trading operations severally losing or gaining as individuals Eventually the regulated company evolved into a joint stock company The English East India Company began its existence as a regulated company but adopted the joint stock company principle in 1612 among other things restricted or ta booed the carriage of articles of com merce to or from England in foreign vessels The British mercantile marine as far as possible was to perform this function It must therefore be fos tered not only because it would obviate the necessity of paying foreigners for the transportation of English goods but also because a large national mer cantile marine meant an extensive foreign trade ENGLISH NAVIGATION ACTS Before discussing the provisions con tained in American tariff acts discrim inating against goods imported in foreign vessels a few observations should be made concerning the Eng lish Navigation Acts as certain feat ures of these acts have been embodied in our own legislation The begin nings of the English Navigation Acts antedate by some centuries the de velopment of mercantilism as a na tional policy The earliest of these laws go back to 1381 and 1390 They ordained that no merchandise should be shipped out of the realm except in British ships on payment of forfeiture These laws and their successors till about the middle of the seventeenth century remained for the most part unenforceable The great Navigation Act of 1651 passed under Cromwell and aimed primarily at the shipping and commercial interests of the Nether lands stands out as a landmark in British commercial history This well known act provided among other things that all products of the growth production or manufacture of Asia Africa or America or any part there of    as well of the English plantations as others should be im ported into England or its territories only in Britishbuilt and British manned vessels Articles grown or made in Europe could be shipped to England only in the vessels of the pro 186DISCRIMINATORY DUTIES ON IMPORTS ducing country or in British ships ex cept silks transported overland to the northwestern coast of the continentl Later navigation acts added to the monopoly of shipping that of colonial commerce and markets2 These acts with certain modifications practically continued in force down to the time of the American Revolution The loss of her American colonies combined with a gradual change from the mercantil istic attitude toward foreign trade re sulted in a freer shipping policy on the part of England although discrimina tion against foreign vessels and the goods carried in such vessels continued for several decades into the nineteenth century American tariff legislation began while the spirit of the Navigation Acts still influenced British statesmen While the first acts were modest com pared with more recent legislation in the duties they exacted from imported articles discriminatory rates were im posed in the interest of goods carried in American bottoms The ostensible purpose of these provisions was the upbuilding of the American merchant marine which in colonial times had formed a considerable fraction of the entire British shipping3 In the words of Chancellor Kent The United States have imitated the policy of Enhgland and other commercial nations 1 Macpherson Annals of Commerce II pp 442444 Lindsay Merchant Shipping and Ancient Commerce II p 183 2 The Navigation Acts did not interfere with colonial shipbuilding and shipping Infact they rather tended to foster these industries It was the regulations with reference to enumerated and nonenumerated commodities to trade with the West Indies and to the manufactures permitted in the colonies that made these acts so irritating to the settlers in the New World 3 At the time of the outbreak of the American Revolution about onethird of the British ship ping engaged in foreign trade was colonial built Bogart Economic History of the United States p 95 Alan Beer Commercial Policy of England toward the American Colonies Chapters 48 in conferring peculiar privileges upon Am ericanbuilt ships and owned by our own citizens The object of the Registry Acts is to encourage our own trade navigation and shipbuilding by granting peculiar or exclusive privileges of trade to the flag of the United States and by prohibiting the communication of these immunities to the shipping and mariners of other countries AMERICAN TARIFF ACTS The first general tariff act passed by Congress in July 1789 provided for a 10 per cent discount in rates below the general import duties where goods from foreign countries were imported in vessels built in the United States and which shall be wholly the prop erty of a citizen or citizens thereof or in vessels built in foreign countries and on the sixteenth day of May last wholly the property of a citizen or citizens of the United States and so continuing until the time of importation2 In addition to this discrimination the Act of 1789 gave the maximum protec tion to American shipping engaged in the trade with the Orient An import duty ranging from 6 to 20 cents per pound was imposed on tea when shipped directly from India or China in American bottoms When transported from Europe to the United States in American vessels the corresponding rates ranged from 8 to 26 cents per pound The duties on tea shipped in foreign vessels ranged from 15 to 45 cents per pound All other Oriental products carried to the United States in foreign bottoms bore a duty of 122 per cent ad valorem which was about double the rates imposed on the corre sponding goods transported in Ameri can vessels3 On account of the lack of sufficient revenue from the duties imposed by the Act of 1789 material increases were made in the rates prescribed by the 1 Kent Commentaries III p 139 2 Act of July 4 1789 sec 5 3 Ibid sec 1 187THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY law of 1790 Similar preferential du ties were prescribed on Oriental goods shipped direct to the United States in American bottoms as in the Act of 1789 A notable change in the latter law was the substitution of a 10 per cent addition to the general rates on goods imported in ships or vessels not of the United States except in the cases in which an additional duty is hereinbefore specially laid on any goods wares or merchandises which shall be imported in such ships or vessels1 for a 10 per cent reduction on articles imported in American bot toms This 10 per cent addition to the normal rates in the case of imported merchandise carried in foreign vessels was also provided for in the laws of 17922 and 17943 In addition to these higher duties on imports transported in foreign ships legislation was enacted imposing dis criminatory tonnage taxes on the vessels themselves In 1789 these tonnage dues were 6 cents per ton on vessels built and owned in the United States or on foreignbuilt vessels owned on and after May 29 1789 30 cents on ships thereafter constructed in the United States but partly or wholly owned by foreigners and on all other shipping 50 cents per ton4 In 1804 a lightmoney tax of 50 cents per ton was imposed on foreign vessels and this rate was increased to 150 per ton in 1812 Like the discriminatory du ties against goods shipped in foreign vessels these added tonnage and light money taxes on the vessels themselves were later rendered inoperative by reciprocal treaties From 1794 to 1815 the addition of a 10 per cent duty to the normal rates on goods imported in foreign vessels re 1 Act of

belonging to Brit ish subjects and brought into the ports of the United States on the northern and northwestern frontiers and similar importation into the ports on the Mississippi River or its branches from New Orleans and other parts of Louisiana and Florida Such mer chandise paid the same rates of duty whether carried in American or foreign vessels1 After the purchase of Lou isiana in 1803 goods carried in French and Spanish ships were similarly priv ileged in the ports of Louisiana for a period of 12 years from the ratification of the treaty ceding this territory to the United States2 The trade relations between England and the United States during this period were strained largely on account of the troubles growing out of the French Revolution and the rise of Napoleon Until 1797 the trade between this country and Great Britain was not on a permanent footing but regulated by Orders in Council and this regulation caused considerable uncertainty An other source of irritation to Americans was the failure to admit American vessels into the British West Indies The Jay Treaty signed by Lord Gren ville and John Jay in November 1794 but not made effective until 1797 was an attempt to remedy this situation3 The commerce between Great Britain and the United States was put on a more permanent basis American ships being allowed to carry into Great Brit ain such produce of their own states as was admissible in English vessels A tonnage duty was levied against Amer ican vessels and discriminating tariff rates on goods carried on them in or 1 Act of May 1 1802

United States by British ships With reference to commerce between the United States and the British West Indies the treaty provided only for the admission into the ports of the latter islands of Ameri can vessels not exceeding seventy tons burden Such vessels were allowed to carry articles of United States produce as were not generally prohibited and at the same time permitted to export therefrom to the United States any produce of the West Indies legally exportable thereto in British vessels A curious proviso was appended to this clause That this liberty only extends to a direct intercourse between the British West Indies and the ports of the United States and the United States engage to prohibit the car riage of molasses sugar coffee cocoa or cotton2 in American vessels either from his Majestys dominions or from the United States to any other part of the world This treaty though ratified by Con gress caused great dissatisfaction among the American people partly because of its failure to provide against certain abuses which eventually led to the War of 1812 and partly on account of some of the provisions above stated giving undue advantage to English merchants and shipping companies The arrange ment with regard to the opening of the trade with the West Indies appears to have fallen to the ground A later treaty in 1806 contained a recital that the high contracting parties had been unable to arrange the terms on which Lindsay Merchant Shipping and Ancient Commerce III pp 60 61 2 The provision with regard to cotton in this treaty has excited much comment It should be remembered however that cotton did not be come an important article of American export until some years after the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 The great importance of American cotton was not realized until several years after the signing of this treaty the commerce between the United States and the West Indies was to be carried on In 1815 a new step was taken in shipping legislation by establishing re ciprocal liberty of commerce That year a law was passed repealing so much of the several acts imposing duties on the tonnage of ships and vessels and on goods wares and merchandise imported into the United States as impose a discrim inating duty of tonnage between foreign vessels and vessels of the United States and between goods imported into the United States in foreign vessels and vessels of the United States This repeal was to take effect whenever the President of the United States shall be satisfied that the discriminatory or countervailing duties of such foreign nation so far as they operate to the disadvantage of the United States have been abolished In accordance with this act a treaty with England a few months later pro vided that no discriminatory tonnage taxes or import duties should be levied against the vessels of either country or their cargoes2 The treaty with England abolished differential duties and tonnage taxes only in the case of the direct trade be tween the contracting parties Where the vessels of either nation touched the ports of a third country and took on additional cargoes they were again subject to discriminatory rates The ports of the British West Indies too re mained practically closed to American vessels For the next fifteen years various negotiations were entered into for the purpose of allowing goods to be carried between this country and the British West Indian and South Ameri can possessions in British and Ameri can vessels on the same terms The conduct of these negotiations was ac companied with many irritating inci 1 Act of March 3 1815 S L III chap lxxvii 2 Lindsay III pp 60 61 189THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY dents and in 1823 Congress authorized the President to prohibit all trade and intercourse with the British possessions in America In May 1830 Congress passed a law giving the President the power to open the ports of the United States to British vessels on the same terms as American vessels whenever he should have evidence that Great Brit ain would open the ports of her colonial possessions in the West Indies South America and the Bermudas for a lim ited or indefinite time to United States ships at the same rates of impost and tonnage and with the same cargoes as British vessels and allow exports from these possessions to any other country in American vessels on the same terms2 In November of the same year a British Order in Council was issued repealing various earlier orders restricting the rights of American vessels and authorizing them to carry goods to and from the British posses sions mentioned on the same terms as English vessels One result of the opening of the British West Indies to American vessels was a great increase in trade Imports from these islands in 1830 amounted to only 19013 In 1840 they had increased to 2965585 While the matter of discriminatory duties and tonnage taxes in the British West India trade was being settled conditions were shaping themselves for a more liberal policy with reference to foreign shipping generally The law of 1815 and subsequent acts up to 1828 applied only to the direct trade between this and the foreign countries with which we had reciprocal treaties In 1Act of March 1 1823 Proclamation pro hibiting this trade was issued March 17 1827 2 Act of May 29 1830 3 This limited trade of course was due to the restrictions put upon it in the United States on account of the failure of Great Britain to allow merchandise to be exported from the islands in American vessels on the same terms as British vessels accordance with the spirit of the Eng lish Navigation Acts which limited the European trade to British vessels or the vessels of the country producing the goods and wares which formed their cargoes foreign ships carrying goods to the United States which were not of the production of the country whose flags they flew were subject to discrim inatory imposts and tonnage dues In 1828 in conformity with an act of Con gress the practice of applying these reciprocity treaties and exemptions only to vessels engaged in the direct trade was definitely abandoned After the passage of the laws of 1815 1828 and 1830 treaties were negotiated with practically all the maritime coun tries of the world exempting from dis criminatory duties the cargoes trans ported in the vessels of the several contracting nations As a consequence the clauses of later tariff acts providing for a 10 per cent increase over the general rates of duty where the im ported product enters the United States in foreign vessels have been of no practical importance For over threequarters of a century goods pro duced in foreign countries have for the most part been subject to the same customs duties regardless of whether they have come in vessels of American or foreign registry Various reasons have been assigned for the abandonment of this form of protection to American shipping It has been suggested that Congress evi dently believed that the American merchant marine had reached a point where it no longer needed this protec tion It has also been urged that for eign commerce while continuing to increase was becoming relatively less important than the domestic trade With the diversion of much American capital to works of internal improve ment and domestic manufacture it has been claimed that public interest in 190DISCRIMINATORY DUTIES ON IMPORTS the merchant marine declined and a gradual modification of the tariff pol icy in the interest of home industries ensued While these reasons were factors in the situation they were not in the judg ment of the writer the most important It is true that in the early decades of the nineteenth century there was great confidence in the ability of the Ameri can mercantile marine to meet foreign competition without any protection a confidence which remained strong until after the Civil War An increas ing amount of American capital was also going into other industrial chan nels There was furthermore some movement after 1815 in the direction of protection to home manufactures The confidence in the competitive strength of American shipping how ever went back to colonial times and was not therefore the growth of the second and third decades of the nine teenth century While capital was indeed being invested in other indus tries a sufficient amount went into the maintenance and upbuilding of the national mercantile marine to give the United States about onethird of the worlds vessel tonnage just before the outbreak of the Civil War The change too in tariff policy after 1815 in the direction of protection reached a climax when the Act of 1828 was passed after which the general move ment until 1861 was in the direction of reduced duties and freer trade GROWTH OF THE AMERICAN MER CANTILE MARINE The growth and maintenance of the American mercantile marine were partly dependent upon a policy of equitable treatment in foreign ports The discriminatory duties and tonnage 1 These reasons are mentioned in Johnson and Huebner Principles of Ocean Transportation p 413 taxes levied against American shipping by England both in Great Britain and in the British West Indies were keenly felt and resented in this country It was the realization of the seriousness of such a handicap that led to the adoption of the policy of reciprocal liberty in the United States The policy of exempting from addi tional tariff duties the cargoes of vessels belonging to such foreign countries as granted corresponding favors to the goods carried in American bottoms continued till the passage of the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 During the intervening period follow ing the adoption of this policy of recip rocal liberty tariff laws generally con tained a section or paragraph imposing an additional 10 per cent duty on all goods imported in vessels of foreign registry but with the proviso that the additional duty should not apply to goods wares and merchandise im ported in ships or vessels not of the United States entitled by treaty or by any act or acts of Congress to be en tered in the ports of the United States on payment of the same duties as are paid on goods wares and merchandise imported in ships or vessels of the United Statesl A further discrim inatory rate of 10 per cent was some times imposed on imported merchan dise coming from any port or place east of the Cape of Good Hope in foreign vessels subject however to the usual exemptions by treaty or Congressional enactment2 In addition to the discriminatory provisions mentioned there is still in recent tariff laws the enactment that no goods wares or merchandise unless in cases provided for by treaty shall be imported into the United States from 1 Act of April 27 1816 and following tariff acts including that of 1913 2 Act of Aug 30 1842 sec 11 Aug 51861 sec 3 June 30 1864 sec 17 191THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY any port or place except in vessels of the United States or in such foreign vessels as truly and wholly belong to the citizens or subjects of that country of which the goods are the growth production or manufacture or from which such goods wares or mer chandise can only be or most usually are first shipped for transportation The penalty for violation of this pro vision is forfeiture of vessel cargo tackle etc This law like the preceding is subject to the usual exemptions by treaty or special acts of Congress The provision is of no practical im portance but is interesting as a sur vival of the spirit of the Navigation Acts The American merchant marine continued to be an important factor in the world trade up to the time of the Civil War Certain contemporaneous changes in the building and operation of ocean vessels2 were slowly undermin ing the strength of American shipping at least that part of it engaged in in ternational trade From the close of the Civil War till after the outbreak of the World War the merchant marine of the United States was a relatively insignificant influence in international commerce Before 1914 however there was a marked revival of interest in this country in shipping with many proposals for encouraging its develop ment In the Tariff Act of 1913 there was in addition to the usual provision for a 10 per cent increase of duties over normal rates on articles imported in foreign vessels another clause granting a discount of 5 per cent on such goods wares and merchandise as shall be imported in vessels admitted to reg istration under the laws of the United Acts of Oct 1 1890 sec 18 Aug 27 1894 sec 15 July 24 1897 sec 23 Aug 5 1909 sec 16 Oct 3 1913 sec 4J subsection 2 2These changes were concerned with the sub stitution of iron and later steel for wood in the construction of ships and steamships for sailing vessels States accompanied with the usual proviso in regard to treaties While no discounts under this clause have been granted to imported articles car ried in American vessels2 the insertion of this subsection in the Act of 1913 is some indication of the rising influence of shipping interests The World War gave a great im petus to the growth of the American mercantile marine From June 1914 to June 1919 according to Lloyds Register of Shipping it increased from about 5500000 gross tons to 13091 773 gross tons3 and in June 1920 amounted to 16049289 gross tons Most of this great development has taken place in that part of our shipping engaged in foreign commerce The movement to conserve this growth and maintain on the high seas the position attained during the war resulted in the passage in 1920 of the Merchant Marine Act Among its several pro visions for the development and main tenance of American shipping is the following Sec 34 That in the judgment of Con gress articles or provisions in treaties or Act of Oct 3 1913 sec 4J subsections 1 and 7 2 The question arose whether or not a 5 per cent discount should not be allowable on all goods carried in American vessels and vessels of foreign countries with which we had reciprocal treaties It was held by the Supreme Court of the United States that the provision was operative only when goods came in vessels of countries with which the United States had no agreement 243 U S 97 of 1917 3 Lloyds Register of Shipping 19141915 II pp 960 961 and 19191920 II p 960 The figures for 1914 in Lloyd are 4330078 gross tons steam and 1038116 net tons sail Adding the gross tons of steam vessels and the estimated gross tons for sailing ships the total would be approximately 5500000 gross tons This figure does not include a considerable tonnage of river craft barges motor boats and certain wooden vessels on the Great Lakes These are added in the published figures of the reports of the Com missioner of Navigation whose total for 1914 is 7928688 gross tons instead of 5500000 192DISCRIMINATORY DUTIES ON IMPORTS conventions to which the United States is a party which restrict the right of the United States to impose discriminating customs duties on imports entering the United States in foreign vessels and in vessels of the United States and which also restrict the right of the United States to impose discriminatory tonnage dues on foreign ves sels and on vessels of the United States entering the United States should be ter minated and the President is hereby authorized and directed within ninety days after that act becomes law to give notice to the several Governments respectively parties to such treaties or conventions that so much thereof as impose any re striction on the United States will termi nate on the expiration of such periods as may be required for the giving of such notice by the provisions of such treaties or conventions This act and especially the provision quoted has excited a great deal of attention abroad and the announce ment of its passage has been followed by threats of retaliation It is reported that no action has yet December 1920 been taken with a view to term inating existing treaties but such action is anticipated and provided for in the law The expediency of reverting to this discriminatory practice may be briefly considered with reference first to the protection of the mercantile marine of the United States so rapidly developed during the war and second to the advisability of resorting to such means in order to attain the end sought 1 The need of a national mercantile marine is not based upon the same grounds as formerly and barring the importance of such a fleet in furnishing auxiliary cruisers in time of war is not so urgent The functions of merchant 1 See a fine statement of this side in Referen dum No 29 on Report of Committee on Ocean Transportation Regarding GovernmentOwned Merchant ShipsArguments in the Negative Chamber of Commerce of United States of America 14 and ocean carrier have become more differentiated than formerly While large manufacturing and trading com panies often own the vessels which transport their goods this combina tion of functions is now largely con fined to companies producing bulky commodities in large quantities which find that by owning and operating their own vessels they avoid much loss of time and uncertainties with reference to proper space and service Neither is the association of government and carrying trade so close as formerly The commodities shipped by the mer chants of one country are now often carried safely and expeditiously in vessels flying the flag of another The government of the world how ever is carried on by nations and when foreign commerce is discussed people think of it in terms of national units A large merchant fleet flying the flag of a country on the high seas and in foreign ports does exert some psychological influence It advertises the country With these considerations in view we see the United States at the close of a world crisis possessed of a greatly enlarged merchant marine Has this transformation been in accord with the economic conditions of the country or is it merely an artificial and therefore temporary development due to a great world emergency This ques tion has been discussed elsewhere by the writer1 and just a few observations will be made here The decline of American shipping after 1860 is connected with the intro duction of iron and later steel vessels and the substitution of steam for sail ing tonnage It was due mainly to the higher cost in this country of iron steel and coal Until the late nineties steel plate and structural steel were 1 The American Economic Review June 1920 The War and the Worlds Mercantile Marine 193THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY higher in price here than in England For a long time bunker coal at our Atlantic seaboard was also more ex pensive Added to these handicaps were greater labor costs both in build ing and in operating vessels Before the war broke out these conditions had changed Steel and coal had become appreciably cheaper and while labor cost remained high it formed a smaller fraction of the total cost of operation than in earlier years The recent change from the use of coal to that of oil also favors the operation of vessels by American concerns2 On the other hand for two genera tions the United States has been a country whose principal industrial interests have been devoted to land pursuits As a result the country has a very limited seafaring population and now lacks the experience which certain European countries have in the conduct of shipping operations on an international scale We have there fore a hiatus between economic posi tion and experience and it is to bridge this gap that some protection may be temporarily necessary 2 Is however a return to discrim inatory import duties the best means of safeguarding our newly acquired position as the second maritime nation of the world A very common experi ence with industrial advances as with political and social reforms is the occasional reversion to practices which have been outgrown or found out of 1 It is difficult to give any definite percentage of the total cost of operation which is properly attributable to labor engaged directly in the sail ing of a vessel It is however smaller than commonly supposed Ten per cent is a large proportion for coalburning freight vessels 2 There is of course involved in the statement the question of the exhaustion of oil resources and the possible monopolization of oil in other parts of the world by foreign concerns For some time the British monopolization of the Mesopo tamian and Persian fields was reported but this has since been denied harmony with more highly developed social conditions Reciprocal freedom of trade was attained only after much struggle with a growing realization that the practice of discriminatory rates invariably led to retaliation Al ready measures have been taken by Japan to retaliate if certain provisions in the Merchant Marine Act including the one quoted above are carried outl and hints of similar reprisals are made in Europe Another fact to be considered in this connection is the general character of our export trade and the probable effect of foreign retaliatory measures In the calendar year 1919 over 33 per cent of our exports consisted of manu factures ready for consumption about 12 per cent of manufactures for further use in manufacturing and over 25 per cent of foodstuffs partly or wholly manufactured Only about 20 per cent consisted of crude materials for use in manufacturesthe bulk of it being raw cotton2 In other words about 70 per cent of our exports are manufactured articles in many lines of which retaliatory measures on the part of foreign governments are likely to undermine the American competi tive position Furthermore coming at a period when the foreign exchange situation is likely to favor the foreign producer such a step appears ill advised There is however a justifiable resort to discriminatory legislation of the character considered above in cases where American vessels are prac tically excluded from trade by foreign conference lines To illustrate The United States imports a large amount of Egyptian cotton All of this cotton comes to this country in foreign vessels There are American ships operating in 1 The Economic Review England Nov 19 1920 p 29 2 The Statistical Abstract 1919 194DISCRIMINATORY DUTIES ON IMPORTS the eastern Mediterranean but thus far practically every American vessel leaving Alexandria goes away empty This loss of freight is ascribed to a powerful British combination which excludes the ships of this country from any participation in its conferences or trade Similar exclusive combinations exist in other parts of the world The imposition of discriminatory customs duties against the products carried in the vessels of countries whose shipping organizations or conferences clearly exclude American companies from any participation in trade would be justifia ble and probably feasible Treaties granting reciprocal liberties to the shipping of the contracting parties might be so framed as to provide some protection against discriminatory prac tices on the part of private combina tions2 While the resort to discriminatory tariff rates as a regular policy is a re version to an earlier practice that the commercial

of coaling stations abroad along important trade routes assistance to shipping companies in securing experienced agencies in other countries to obtain cargoes2 the crea tion of free ports in Virgin Islands Porto Rico Panama and Philippines3 temporary subsidies to lines operating between the United States and regions whose future growth promises to pay for the outlay4 and the sale of govern mentowned ships at prices low enough to induce purchasers to invest and the absorption by the government of the difference between such prices and the war cost as a war loss5 A noteworthy fact in connection with suggested aids is the almost entire absence of any demand for general ship subsidies It is not the purpose of this article to discuss any of these suggestions or others that have been urged Some of these proposals will in the judgment of the writer mean more for the upbuild ing of the American merchant marine if properly carried out than discrimi natory tariff rates against

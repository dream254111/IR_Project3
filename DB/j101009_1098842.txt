BY THE CITY IS NOT A NECESSARY INCIDENT TO THE PAVING AND IMPROVING OF KING STREET WITH VITRIFIED BRICK THAT THE RAILS IN PRESENT USE WERE AT THE TIME THEY WERE LAID OF THE MOST IMPROVED PATTERN AND SUCH AS WERE THEN COM MONLY IN USE AND WERE LAID NOT ONLY WITHOUT OBJECTION BY THE CITY BUT WITH ITS APPROVAL AND ACQUIESCENCE NOW IT MAY VERY WELL BE THAT UPON ALL THESE ISSUES THE JURY WERE

AND CAN EXERCISE NO POWER THAT IS NOT DERIVED FROM ITS CREATOR  WHERE LEGISLATIVE POWER IS CONFERRED UPON IT BY THE STATE IT IS NECESSARY THAT A DEGREE OF FREEDOM SHOULD BE ALLOWED IN ITS EXERCISE OTHERWISE THE CITY WOULD BE SO HAMPERED IN THE GOVERNMENT OF ITS PEOPLE AS WOULD DEFEAT THE VERY ENDS OF ITS INCORPORATION  HENCE IT IS THAT THE COURTS WILL NEVER INTERFERE WITH THE FREE EXERCISE OF SUCH RIGHTS AS ARE LEFT TO THE DISCRETION OF A CORPORATE AU THORITY UNLESS SUCH AUTHORITY SHOULD GO BEYOND THE SCOPE OF POWER DELEGATED OR UNLESS THE DISCRETION GIVEN SHOULD BE ABUSED BY AN ARBITRARY

THEIR USE C THE WORD REGULATE IS ONE OF BROAD IMPORT IT IS THE WORD USED IN THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION TO DEFINE THE POWER OF CON GRESS OVER FOREIGN AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND HE WHO READS THE MANY OPINIONS OF THIS COURT WILL PERCEIVE HOW BROAD AND COMPREHENSIVE IT HAS BEEN HELD TO BE IF THE CITY GIVES A RIGHT TO THE USE OF THE STREETS OR PUBLIC GROUNDS AS IT DID BY ORDINANCE NO 11604 IT SIMPLY REGU LATES THE USE WHEN IT PRESCRIBES THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THEY SHALL BE USED IF IT SHOULD SEE FIT TO CONSTRUCT AN EXPENSIVE BOULEVARD IN THE CITY AND THEN LIMIT THE USE TO VEHICLES OF A CERTAIN KIND OR EXACT A TOLL FROM ALL WHO USE IT WOULD THAT BE OTHERWISE THAN A REGULATION OF THE USE  AND SO IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF REGULATION OF USE WHEN THE CITY GRANTS A TELEGRAPH COMPANY THE

ORDINANCE WHICH IT WAS ORDERED TO OBEY THAT IT HAS NOT SHOWN THAT IT WAS PASSED ARBITRARILY OR CAPRICIOUSLY AND THE JUDGMENT OF THE CIRCUIT COURT MUST BE AFFIRMED AFFIRMED NOTETHE OPINION IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE IS VALUABLE FOR ITS DISCUSSION OF THE RIGHTS OF A MUNICIPAL CORPORATION IN THE REGULATION OF THE USE OF ITS STREETS BY A STREET RAILWAY COMPANY TO WHICH IT HAS GRANTED THE FRANCHISE OF USING THE STREETS FOR ITS TRACKS AND CARS THE CASE IS ALSO AUTHORITY FOR THE PROPOSITION ESTABLISHED WITHOUT DISCUSSION THAT MANDAMUS IS THE PROPER REMEDY TO COMPEL A STREET RAILWAY COMPANY AT THE RELATION OF THE CITY TO CONFORM TO A MUNICIPAL ORDINANCE REQUIRING THE RAILWAY COMPANY TO SUBSTITUTE A DIFFERENT CHARACTER OF RAIL FROM THAT IN USE IN THE STREETS

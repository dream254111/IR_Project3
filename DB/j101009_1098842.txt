CORPORATIONsRegulation of streetsContinuing powerReasona bleness The power of a city to control and regulate its streets is a continuing power to be exercised as often as and whenever the city council may think proper subject only to the limitation that it must act in good faith and that the regulation must be reasonable and not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously the presumption being in favor of the propriety and validity of what the city has directed to be done 3 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONSRegulation of streetsStreet railwaysChange of railsMandamusJudgment non obstante Whether a city which has ample power to control and regulate the use of its streets and which permits a street railway company to lay its rails of an improved pattern in the streets can thereafter require the company to replace its rails by others of a different pattern depends upon the reasonableness of the requirement and whether it was made in good faith or not The reasonableness of such requirement is a ques tion for the court and not for the jury and in a proceeding by mandamus to compel the change of rails the court may award the mandamus notwithstand ing the verdict of a jury finding that the old rails had been approved by the city in the first instance that they did not obstruct the ordinary use of the street that they were of an improved pattern and that the new rail was not a necessary incident of a proposed street improvement Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of the city of Alexandria rendered April 22 1899 on a petition for a mandamus wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case J M Wilson and J R Caton for the plaintiff in error Gardner L Boothe for the defendant in error KEITH P delivered the

city of Alexandria in the year 1892 using rails of an improved pattern known as the tram girder rail such as were then commonly in use and as are still used by many street railways The City Council of Alexandria by an ordinance approved July 15 1898 ordered that a portion of King street one of the principal thoroughfares of the city should for the distance of one square be repaved with vitrified brick on a six inch concrete base and by another ordinance of the same date directed the appellant company to put down on the said square rails to be approved by the committee on streets and to grade and pave on the space between its railway tracks and two feet on each side thereof in a similar manner and by another ordinance approved September 23 1898 further directed the appellant company to take up its rails on said square in King street and to lay in their stead  a grooved rail with a groove not exceeding one and one eighth inches in depth and with a tram not lower than onefourth inch below the head and with the groove of the outline shown by the full lines of the drawing attached to said ordinance The appellant company failing to obey the City Council presented its petition to the Judge of the Circuit Court of the city of Alexandria for a writ of mandamus to compel a compliance with the requirements of said ordinance The petition sets forth that the ordinance is a reasonable regulation of the use of the street which the city has full power to make under section 33 of its charter and under the general law that the paving of King street is greatly needed and desired by the citizens of Alex andria and a grooved rail is a necessary incident to the improvement King street being the principal business street of the city with a heavy wagon traffic upon it and measuring only 37 feet from curb to curb that owing to the narrowness of the street traffic is compelled to follow the tracks and rails of the appellant company and therefore any rail way track on King street is to some extent an impediment to its free use and that for these reasons the rail used should be such as to impede general traffic in the least possible degree It is further averred that the rail now used upon King street is such as to prevent vehicles from turning out of the railway track except with great strain to the wheels axles and running gear and jolting in direct crossing The form of the rails and the nature and extent of the inconvenience they occasion is set out with much detail in the petition and for the reasons thus stated the petition avers that 317318 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept the rails as at present laid are a nuisance and an obstruction to the ordinary use of the street To this petition the appellant company demurred the demurrer being overruled it answered and thereupon issues were framed to be tried by a jury as follows 1 Whether or not the several ordinances alleged and set forth in the peti tion directing the grading and paving of King street between the west crossing of Fairfax street and east crossing of Royal street and directing the Washington Alexandria and Mt Vernon Railway Company to remove the rail now laid upon said square and to substitute a grooved rail of the pattern set forth in said peti tion were duly passed approved and published as required by provisions of the charter of the city and whether or not the conditions to the passage of the ordi nance for the improvement of said streets have been complied with  2 Whether or not the present rails in use by respondent on King street be tween the west side of Fairfax street and the east side of Royal street will ob struct the ordinary use of said portion of King street provided the proposed improvement of said portion of King street is made by the city of Alexandria as set out in the ordinance approved by the Mayor of said city on July 15 1898 and entitled An ordinance to provide for the grading paving and curbing of King street from the west crossing of Fairfax street to the east crossing of Royal street and for the assessment of the costs thereof under the thirtythird sec tion of the city charter as amended by an act of the General Assembly approved February 7 1898  3 Whether or not the present rails in use by respondent on King street be tween the west crossing of Fairfax street and the east crossing of Royal street will be and are of approved patternthat is of such pattern on account of merit and excellence and adaptation for the purposes for which they are used as should be approved by the city authorities of Alexandria provided the proposed im provement of said portion of King street is made by the city of Alexandria as set out in the ordinances approved by the Mayor of said city on July 15 1898 and entitled An ordinance to provide for the grading paving and curbing of King street from the west crossing of Fairfax street to the east crossing of Royal street and for the assessment of the costs thereof under the thirtythird section of the city charter as amended by an act of the General Assembly approved February 7 1898 4 Whether or not the proposed rails mentioned in the ordinance approved on November 23 1898 and entitled An ordinance directing the Washington Alexandria and Mt Vernon Railway Company to take up the rails now laid on King street from the west crossing of Fairfax street to the east crossing of Royal street and to lay a grooved rail and to grade and pave the space between said rails and two feet on each side thereof said paving to be done with vitrified brick on a sixinch concrete base is a necessary incident to the paving and improving of said portion of King streetthat is whether the public good and the reasonable and ordinary use of said portion of King street requires that said proposed rails be used provided said improvement of King street is made as described in said ordi nance of July 15 1898 instead of allowing the rails now in use by respondent on1900 WASHINGTON ETC RY CO V ALEXANDRIA said portion of King street to remain provided said improvement of said portion of King street is made by the city of Alexandria as described in said ordinance of July 15 1898 5 Whether or not at the time tle present rails were laid they were of the most approved pattern and such as were then commonly in use Were said rails so laid without objection by the city authorities and with their approval or acquiescence The jury found the first of these issues in favor of the City Council Upon the second third fourth and fifth it found in favor of the ap pellant The appellant therefore could not be prejudiced by any instructions given by the court or any ruling made upon the admission of testimony respecting the trial upon the issues thus found in its favor When the cause came on to be heard after the jury had rendered their verdict the court rendered a judgment non obstante veredicto and awarded the writ of nmandamus in accordance with the prayer of the City Council of Alexandria To this judgment a writ of error was awarded We think the demurrer to the petition was properly overruled and upon this subject we shall add nothing to what has already been said with respect to its averments The finding of the jury upon the first issue is clearly warranted by the proof Nor do we think there was any error in the final judgment rendered by the court It is true that the jury have found by their verdict in response to the issues submitted that the rails now in use by appellant on King street will not obstruct the ordinary use of that street when the proposed improvement is made by the city of Alexan dria as set out in its ordinance of July 15 1898 They also found that the present rails are of approved pattern that is of such merit and excellence and adaptation for the purposes for which they are used as should in the opinion of the jury be approved by the city authorities of Alexandria The jury has also found by its verdict that the substitution of the grooved rail as proposed by the city is not a necessary incident to the paving and improving of King street with vitrified brick that the rails in present use were at the time they were laid of the most improved pattern and such as were then com monly in use and were laid not only without objection by the city but with its approval and acquiescence Now it may very well be that upon all these issues the jury were justified in all their findings by the evidence submitted to them It might also be that the court was of the same opinion upon the evidence and yet it is entirely consistent with both these concessions that its judgment non obstante veredicto should be affirmed 2 196 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER The real issue to be considered and decided is this Was the ordi nance of the city a reasonable one regard being had to all the circumstances of the case or did the City Council in passing the ordi nance act capriciously and arbitrarily  Its charter and the general law confer upon the city of Alexandria ample power to control and regulate the laying out repair and use of its streets To do so said this court in Roanoke Gas Company v The City of Roanoke 88 Va 810  is a power essentially incident to the existence and well being of every municipal corporation and powers thus delegated are trusts held for the public good are continu ing and cannot be contracted away nor can the municipal authori ties bind themselves by contract not to exercise them from time to time as the public good may require  and of the necessity and expediency of the exercise of such power the city council and not the court is the judge R F  P R R Co v City of Richmond 26 Gratt 83 Davenport v City of Richmond 81 Va 636 Charlottes ville v Southern Ry Co 97 Va 428 Roller v Harrisonburg Id 582 In Burkhart v City of Atlanta 30 S E 32 the court said An incorporated city is a government within a government It has its own executive judicial and legislative branches It is a creature of the State and can exercise no power that is not derived from its creator  Where legislative power is conferred upon it by the State it is necessary that a degree of freedom should be allowed in its exercise otherwise the city would be so hampered in the government of its people as would defeat the very ends of its incorporation  Hence it is that the courts will never interfere with the free exercise of such rights as are left to the discretion of a corporate au thority unless such authority should go beyond the scope of power delegated or unless the discretion given should be abused by an arbitrary exercise thereof and by a plain and unwarranted violation of private rights Dillon on Municipal Corps section 95 says When a municipal corporation by its charter is empowered if it deems the public welfare or convenience requires it to open streets or make public improve ments thereon its determination whether wise or unwise cannot be judicially revised or corrected Mr Justice Brewer in St Louis v Western U Tel Co 149 U S 465 delivering the opinion of the court said The city is given 320 SeptWASHINGTON ETC RY CO V ALEXANDRIA power to open and establish streets to improve them and to regulate their use c The word regulate is one of broad import It is the word used in the Federal Constitution to define the power of Con gress over foreign and interstate commerce and he who reads the many opinions of this court will perceive how broad and comprehensive it has been held to be If the city gives a right to the use of the streets or public grounds as it did by ordinance No 11604 it simply regu lates the use when it prescribes the terms and conditions upon which they shall be used If it should see fit to construct an expensive boulevard in the city and then limit the use to vehicles of a certain kind or exact a toll from all who use it would that be otherwise than a regulation of the use  And so it is only a matter of regulation of use when the city grants a telegraph company the right to use ex clusively a portion of the street on condition of contributing some thing towards the expense it has been to in opening and improving the streets To the same effect see Gloucester Ferry Co v Penn 114 U S 196203 The power to regulate commerce says Mr Justice Field speaking for this court is the power to prescribe the rules by which it shall be governed that is the conditions upon which it shall be conducted If it be said in this case that the city had already regulated the use by prescribing that there should be two tracks the answer is that the power of regulation is a continuing power It is not exhausted by being once exercised and so long as the object is plainly one of regu lation the power may be exercised as often as and whenever the com mon council may think proper the use of the street may be subjected to one condition today and to another and additional one tomorrow provided the power is exercised in good faith and the condition im posed is appropriate as a reasonable regulation and is not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously See also Baltimore v The Baltimore Trust  Guarantee Co Trustee 166 U S 1160 In Louisville City Ry v City of Louisville 8 Bush Ky 415 Judge Lindsay speaking for the court said  We will not assume that the city government in the exercise of the legislative power to regulate the reconstruction of the railway company on Jefferson street acted capriciously or without sufficient reason The presumption of the law is that it did not It is not necessary to make further citation of authority to show that the City Council was clothed with ample power to control and regulate 1900 321322 6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Sept the streets of the city that this was a continuing power to be exercised as often and whenever the council may think proper subject only to the limitation that it must act in good faith that the regulation must be reasonable and not imposed arbitrarily or capriciously the pre sumption being in favor of the propriety and validity of what the city has directed to be done Dillon on Mun Corps sec 327 says Whether an ordinance be reasonable and consistent with the law or not is a question for the court and not the jury and evidence to the latter on the subject is in admissible But in determining this question the court will regard all the cir cumstances of the particular city or corporation the objects sought to be attained and the necessity which exists for the ordinance Regula tions proper for a large and prosperous city might be absurd or oppres sive in a small and sparsely populated town or in the country Without going into the evidence in detail upon the subject of the reasonableness of the ordinance we are of opinion that it clearly shows that there was no fraud in its passage that the city did not act capri ciously but in accordance with what it deemed best to promote the in terests confided to it that the action it took was urged upon it by many of its citizens that the rail adopted is that in use by the city of Washington as required by an act of Congress of the United States It further appears that representatives of the appellant were invited to attend a meeting of the committee on streets and the city engineer where the whole subject was carefully considered and as a result of their deliberations the engineer and committee recommended the pro posed rail to the City Council and they thereupon passed the ordinance requiring its adoption In view of these facts it is manifest that the appellant has not over come the presumption in favor of the reasonableness of the ordinance which it was ordered to obey that it has not shown that it was passed arbitrarily or capriciously and the judgment of the Circuit Court must be affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe opinion in the principal case is valuable for its discussion of the rights of a municipal corporation in the regulation of the use of its streets by a street railway company to which it has granted the franchise of using the streets for its tracks and cars The case is also authority for the proposition established without discussion that mandamus is the proper remedy to compel a street railway company at the relation of the city to conform to a municipal ordinance requiring the railway company to substitute a different character of rail from that in use in the streets

Fusion,i241959,No X An Inquiry into the Causes why the Metals in a Solid State appear to be Specifically lighter than they are in the State of Fusion By Joseph CloudRead July 15th 1814 AN opinion has universally prevailed among chemists and metallurgists that cast iron in the state of fusion occu pies less volume and is consequently denser than it is in the solid state This inference has arisen out of what has been considered an anomalous circumstance that unfused iron will float on the surface of that metal ill the fluid state This how ever is not peculiar to iron for although it may have escaped the notice of others experience authorises me to assert that the same law appears to govern the other metals under the same circumstances This singular fact would naturally lead to such a conclusion for what better evidence can be looked for in the laws of gravity to establish the superior density of a fluid than that of supporting the solid on its surface  but this paradoxical phenomenon appears to be irreconcileable with the laws of expansion and fusionCaloric whose particles mu tually repel each other and the attraction of cohesion are antagonist forces the action of one always opposing resist ance to and diminishing that of the other Expansioni arises from the excess of energy in the repulsive power of the calo ric over the force of cohesion inlherent in the ultimate inte grals of the metal and thereby increasing the distance andINQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OP METALS 171 diminishing the attraction of cohesion between them until they are in a situation to move independently of each other and thus constitute fusion At this period however the at traction of cohesion is not completely destroyed as an increased temperature and expansion are required to produce evaporation To prove that the energy of attraction is not destroyedlst If we place a small quantity of metal in the state of fusion on a plane surface it will assume the spheri cal form and if two of these globules are made to approach they will attract each other and form one sphere 2d If a glass plate be laid on a globule of mercury the globule not withstanding the pressure applied to it endeavours to preserve its spherical form if we gradually charge the plate with weights the globule will be depressed and become thinner and thinner but if we again remove the weights from the plate the mercury will instantly recover its former figure and push up the glass before it From these facts it ap pears lst That the metals in a state of fusion are not mere inert fluids as they could not assume the globular form unless a real reciprocal attraction among their particles existed The 2d proves that the attraction is not only superior to gravitation but that it also overcomes an external force It is a practical fact well known to every iron founder that in order to procure a casting of certain dimensions it is ne cessary to have patterns and moulds from 18th to 3l6ths of an inch to the foot larger than the casting is intended to be and that spherical castings such as cannon balls wil be 166th of their diameter less than the moulds in which they were cast The reverse of this would take place if it were true that iron in the state of fluidity occupied less space than the solid metal for the fluid when first cast into the mould must necessarily fill its whole cavity and its expansion in cooling would produce a casting of larger size than the pattern and mould The sharpness of iron castings has also been advanced as an evidence in support of the superior density of the fused metal This circumstance however appears more probably to depend upon the fusibility of the metals iron 2172 INQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF METALS being the most infusible of the metals used for that pur pose it will necessarily produce the sharpest castings For when melted iron is poured into a mould it runs like other fluids into all the interstices of the mould which being at a lower temperature than that of the metal the heat is con ducted off from the external particles of the metal by the first impression and the surface is reduced to a state of solid ity under the pressure of the superiincumbent fluid before any change of temperature or contraction takes place in the cen tre  in this way a shell of solid metal will be formed cor responding to the most minute impressions or figures of the mould and although a subsequent contraction of the whole mass takes place and the figures on the casting are diminished in size they lose nothing of their sharpness and perfection Having briefly noticed the laws of expansion and fusion anid a few practical facts connected with iron founding in which I flatter myself that I have satisfactorily shown the prevailing opinion respecting the superior density of the fused mnetal to be if not erroneous at least very doubtful I slhall now endea vour to account for the buoyancy of the unfused metals from the laws governing the metals in the state of fusion lst The attraction of cohesion existing among the particles of the fused metals 2d The radiant caloric escaping in a strong ascending current from all parts of the melted mass its levity naturally giving it that tendency and from its meeting least resistance in that direction These cooperating powers will oppose the gravitation of the unfused metal with a force suf ficient to overcome its superior density and support it on the surface of the fluid till it has nearly acquired the same tem perature This effect will necessarily be the most remarka bly produced in the case of iron in consequence of the in tense degree of heat required to fuse it The truth of this  As the cooling process contintues to go on from the surface to the cen tre and the loss of temperature increases the attraction of cohesion the particles of the metal will be drawn from the centre toward tthe surface hence we find the centre to be hollow or honeycomb unless this effect is prevented by what the founders call a sinking headINQUIRY INTO THE NATURE OF METALS 173 hypothesis is rendered more probable by the remarkable cir cumstance noticed by Mr Mushet that the solid metal notwithstanding its expansion by the increased temperature sinks in the fluid when it arrives nearly at the fusing point and previous to its passing into that state This singular fact however inconsistent it may appear is nevertheless recon cileable with the laws of cohesion repulsion and gravity The metals in a state of fusion do not operate as mere con ductors of heat but their particles being considerably sepa rated like all other fluids permit the caloric to pass in an uninterrupted current between them without being subjected to the tardy and progressive conducting powers of the solid metal The heat thus passing through the fluid metal with increased facility and striking the under surface of the unfused metal will become subjected to the conducting powers there of and consequently be retarded in its progress a strong current of ascending caloric will then continue to oppose the superior gravity of the unfused metal and keep it buoyant until it arrives nearly at the melting heat when it becomes so much expanded that the caloric is not entirely subjected to the conducting power of the metal for in proportion to the in creased expansion so will the passage of the calonrc be facili tated and its action on the unfused metal diminished until it ceases to oppose a sufficient force cooperating with the at traction of cohesion to prevent the unfused metal from sink ing by its superior density  Or assuming what is no doubt generally the case that the bottom part of a meltingpot is hotter than the upper part and especially when a piece of solid and comparatively cold metal is placed on the surface a cuirrent in the particles of the melted metal will on hydrostatic principles take place from the bottom upwards and thus from their mechanical impetus will contribute to prevent the unfused metal from sinking From a similar caise if in a vessel of boiling water a solid body of somewhat suiperior spe cific gravity be laid on the surfacep it will not sink but remail buoyant as long as the water boils

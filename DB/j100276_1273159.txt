It is the latter which constitutes consent within the statute By holding that the lease requiring the tenant to keep the premises in good repair    and all machinery and boilers in good working order at his own cost required this work to be done the court reasoned from the cases cited that there was an actual and express requirement that the improvement be made As a consequence a mechanics lien was allowed In general the cases on this subject are decided to a large extent upon the particular facts of each case However there are in a general way principles which may be evolved from them Where specific improvements are required by a lease the general rule is that there is sufficient consent especially if the improve ments are a part of the consideration for the lease Burkitt v Harper 79 N Y

On the other hand it has been held that where the improvements are made with no reduction in rent and with a stipulation that they be made at the cost of the lessee no consent of the owner is implied which will maintain a mechanics lien Boteler v Espen 99 Pa St 313 In leases in which the lessee covenants to make repairs at his own expense it is generally held that consent of the owner within the statutory meaning is not implied because it is not a consent that the work should be done on the credit of the land Conant v Brackett 112 Mass I8 Boone v Chatfield 118 N C 916 Hervey v Gay 42 N J Law I68 In some states it is held that if the owner knows that the repairs are being made and does not dissent his interest will be held liable to a mechanics lien This holding is due to the peculiar wording of the statute Congdon v Cook 55 Minn I 56 N W 253 West Coast Lumber Co v Newkirk 80 Cal 275 22 Pac 231 In the absence of such statutory provisions there are holdings on both sides of the question as to whether mere knowledge will impute consent Consent implied Shaw v Young 87 Me 271 32 Atl 897 Contra Peoples L  B Assn v Spears 115 Ind 297 17 N E 570 NAVIGABLE WATERSFLOATAGE oF LOGSRIGHTS OF PUBLICIn an action of trespass by a riparian owner against a booming company for carelessly and negligently permitting logs to be floated down a stream and pile up on the banks in heaps or jams which turned the water from the channel upon plaintiffs land held that a stream is a navigable or floatable one if by the increased precipitation at seasons recurring periodically with reasonable cer tainty the flow of water will be sufficient to be substantially useful to the public for transportation and one floating logs therein is not liable for injuries to a riparian owner from the piling up of logs on his land if due and ordinary care were used to prevent injury Hot Springs Lumber  Mfg Co v Revercomb I9o6  Va  55 S E Rep 580 The question as to what constitutes a floatable stream not being deter mined by statute in Virginia the court necessarily based its decision on what it conceived to be the common law Upon the questions involved the courts 393MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW are not in harmony but the holding in this case accords with the weight of authority The tendency of judicial opinion is in the direction of recognizing streams as public highways even though they are susceptible of but a mini mum of floatability Usually it is required that the floatage be a result of natural causes at periods ordinarily recurring from year to year and con tinuing for a sufficient length of time in each year to make it useful as a highway Thunder Bay Booming Co v Speechley 31 Mich 336 I8 Am Rep 184 Lewis v Coffee County 77 Ala Io9 Shaw v Oswego Iron Co Io Ore gon 371 45 Am Rep 146 But it is not sufficient to impress navigable char acter upon a stream that there may be extraordinary times of transient freshets Little Rock etc R R Co v Brooks 43 Am Rep 275 However in Commissioners v Lumber Co 116 N C 731 a stream was held to be float able in which were shoals where the water was not deep enough to permit the passage of logs but eight or ten times a year at irregular intervals the stream rose several feet remaining at such height from 24 to 48 hours during which time logs were carried over the shoals without artificial assistance The true criterion seems to depend upon the usefulness of the stream to the popula tion on its banks the stream must be actually capable of some profitable use and when it is so capable it not only becomes a highway in which the public has an easement but is subjected to the incidents of such use Powell v Springston Lumber Co I9o6  Idaho  88 Pac Rep 97 Mitchell v Lea Lumber Co 86 Pac 405 Log Driving Co v Byron 63 Atl 913 Such use is a limitation to which the individual must yield something of his absolute rights with respect to person and property in subordination to the rights of others REMANDING OE CAUSESMANDAMUS TO CoMPELWisner a citizen of Michigan commmenced an action against Beardsley a citizen of Louisiana in the State Circuit Court for St Louis The proper steps having been taken the case was removed to the United States Circuit Court for that district whereupon a motion was filed by the plaintiff to have the case remanded but the motion was overruled Application was then made to the Supreme Court of the United States for a writ of mandamus or prohibition to be directed to the Federal Circuit Court that further proceedings there might be pre vented Held that the writ of mandamus should issue Ex parte Abram C Wisner 203 U S  27 Sup Ct Rep I50 In order that a cause may be removed from the State Court in which it is pending to the Federal Circuit Court for that district it must appear that it is such a case as might have been originally brought in the Federal Court Congress has enacted that in all actions of which the Federal Circuit Court has jurisdiction the action must be brought in the district of which the defendant is a resident but when the parties are citizens of different districts it may be brought either in the district of which the plaintiff or defendant is a resident After determining that not only must the plaintiff or defendant be a resident of the district in which the action is brought but also a citizen except where both parties submit to the jurisdiction and that in the prin cipal case neither the plaintiff nor defendant was a citizen of Missouri and 394

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,109832,FARTHER ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS RELATIVE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PRUSSIC OF THE FERRURETTED CHYAZIC AND OF THE SULPHURETTED CHYAZIC ACIDS AND TO THAT OF THEIR SALTS TOGETHER WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE ATOMIC THEORY TO THE ANALYSES OF THOSE BODIES ABSTRACT,I207044,2I THE SATURATED SOLUTION OF THE NEW GAS IN WATER WHEN MIXED WITH ALKALINE SOLUTIONS DOES NOT IMMEDIATELY LOSE ITS COLOUR OR NEUTRALIZE THE ALKALIES BUT AFTER A TIME THE HYPEROXYMURIATES ARE FORMED AND THE COLOUR DISAPPEARS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE DOUBT WHICH NOW OCCURS CONCERNING THE TRUE NATURE OF EUCHLORINE THE AUTHOR DECLINES GIVING A NAME TO THE PRE SENT COMPOUND TILL HE CAN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF MAKING SOME NEW EXPERIMENTS ON THAT SUBJECT FARTHER ANALYTICAL EXPERIMENTS RELATIVE TO THE CONSTITUTION OF THE PRUSSIC OF THE FERRURETTED CHYAZIC AND OF THE SULPHURETTED CHYAZIC ACIDS AND TO THAT OF THEIR SALTS TOGETHER WITH THE APPLICATION OF THE ATOMIC THEORY TO THE ANALYSES OF THOSE BODIES BY ROBERT PORRETT JUN ESQ COMMUNICATED BY W H WOLLASTON MD SEC RS READ MAY 11 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 220 IN A FORMER PAPER THE AUTHOR ENDEAVOURED TO SHOW THAT PRUSSIC ACID WOULD COMBINE WITH BLACK OXIDE OF IRON OR WITH SULPHUR AND FORM WITH THEM PECULIAR ACIDS TO WHICH HE GAVE THE NAMES OF FERRURETTED AND SULPHURETTED CHYAZIC ACIDS AND HE EXAMINED IN WHAT PROPORTION THE ELEMENTS OF THESE NEW ACIDS ARE COMBINED AS WELL AS THE PROPOR TIONS IN WHICH THE ACIDS UNITE TO DIFFERENT SALINE BASES MR PORRETTS PRESENT OBJECT IS TO ADD THE RESULTS OF TWO NEW ANA LYSES MADE WITH GREAT CARE AND TO CORRECT THOSE INACCURACIES OF EX PERIMENT WHICH ARE AT ALL TIMES UNAVOIDABLE BY THE ASSISTANCE OF THE THEORY OF DALTON RESPECTING THE RELATIVE WEIGHTS OF ATOMS AND OF BERZELIUS RESPECTING MULTIPLE DOSES OF OXYGEN THE FIRST COMPOUND HERE EXAMINED IS PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY TEN GRAINS OF THIS SALT WERE DECOMPOSED BY HYDROSULPHURET OF SODA AND YIELDED 9 3 OF BLACK SULPHURET OF MERCURY THE RESIDUAL LIQUOR BEING TREATED WITH SULPHATE OF COPPER YIELDED 9 7 OF SULPHURETTED CHYAZATE OF COPPER WHICH BY FORMER ANALYSES IS KNOWN TO CONTAIN 1 38 PRUS SIC ACID IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE QUANTITY OF RED OXIDE OF MERCURY INDI CATED BY THE WEIGHT OF BLACK SULPHURET OBTAINED 25 GRAINS OF COR ROSIVE SUBLIMATE WERE DECOMPOSED BY HYDROSULPHURET OF POTASH AND YIELDED 215 GRAINS AND SINCE THE QUANTITY OF RED OXIDE CONTAINED IN THE SUBLIMATE IS KNOWN TO BE 79 PER CENT IT IS INFERRED THAT 9 3 BLACK SULPHURET ARE EQUIVALENT TO 862 RED OXIDE AND HENCE THAT 100 GRAINS OF PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY CONSIST OF 13 8 PRUSSIC ACID AND 862 RED OXIDE OF MERCURY FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING THE CONSTITUTION OF PRUSSIC ACID MR PORRETT EFFECTED ITS DECOMPOSITION BY MIXING PRUSSIATE OF MER CURY WITH RED OXIDE OF MERCURY IN SUCH PROPORTION THAT BY THE AS SISTANCE OF HEAT THE WHOLE OF THE PRUSSIC ACID MIGHT BE CONVERTED INTO CARBONIC ACID AZOTE AND WATER BY A NUMBER OF TRIALS HE FOUND THAT THIS WAS NOT COMPLETELY EFFECTED TILL THE QUANTITY OF RED OXIDE ADDED AMOUNTED TO FIVE TIMES THE QUANTITY CONTAINED IN THE PRUSSIATE IN THE DECOMPOSITION OF PRUSSIATE OF MERCURY ALONE BY HEAT IT IX ONLY22 ONE SIXTH PART OF THE PRUSSIC ACID WHICH IS DECOMPOSED BY THE QUAN TITY OF OXYGEN IN THE OXIDE PRESENT AS A CONSTITUENT OF THAT SALT AND HENCE FIVE MORE EQUAL QUANTITIES ARE REQUISITE TO EFFECT THE COMPLETE DECOMPOSITION OF THE WHOLE IN ALL CASES IT IS OBSERVABLE THAT THE QUANTITY OF AZOTE PRODUCED IS EXACTLY EQUAL IN VOLUME TO THE QUAN TITY OF PRUSSIC ACID GAS DECOMPOSED AND THE QUANTITY OF CARBONIC ACID EXACTLY THE DOUBLE OF THE SAME MEASURE TOGETHER WITH THESE IS PRODUCED A QUANTITY OF WATER CONTAINING TWICE AS MUCH OXYGEN AS IS CONTAINED IN THE CARBONIC ACID THE AUTHOR TAKES PAINS TO DESCRIBE WITH MUCH PRECISION THE PRE CAUTIONS WHICH HE FOUND IT EXPEDIENT TO EMPLOY FOR EFFECTING THE EN TIRE DECOMPOSITION OF THE PRUSSIC ACID THE MODE OF PREPARIING THE RED OXIDE OF GRINDING THE MATERIALS OF CHARGING THE TUBE THAT HE EMPLOYS AS A RETORT OF APPLYING THE HEAT TO THE SEVERAL PARTS IN SUCCESSION AND OF RECEIVING AND EXAMINING THE PRODUCTS THE RESULTS OF THIS ANALYSIS OF PRUSSIC ACID SHOW THAT 100 GRAINS CONSIST OF 34 8 CARBON 407 AZOTE 245 HYDROGEN IN A TABLE WHICH FOLLOWS THE AUTHOR EXHIBITS AT ONE VIEW THE RE SULTS OF HIS ANALYSIS OF PRUSSIC ACID AND OF TEN DIFFERENT COMPOUNDS INTO WHICH IT ENTERS AND AT THE SAME TIME A COMPARATIVE STATEMENT OF THOSE PROPORTIONS WHICH MAY BE SUPPOSED MORE NEAR APPROXIMATIONS TO THE TRUTH FROM THEORETIC CONSIDERATIONS OF THE NUMBER OF ATOMS CONTAINED IN EACH OF THE SALTS UNDER EXAMINATION ON THE INATURE AND COMBINATIONS OF A NEWLY DISCOVERED VEGETABLE ACID  WITH OBSERVATIONS ON THE MALIC ACID AND SUGGESTIONS ON THE STATE IN WHICH ACIDS MAY HAVE PREVIOUSLY EXISTED IN VEGETABLES BY M DONOVAN ESQ COMMUNICATED BY WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON MD SEC RS READ JUNE 1 1815 PHIL TRANS 1815 P 231 THE ACID HERE NOTICED BY THE AUTHOR BEING OBTAINED IN GREATEST QUANTITY FROM THE FRUIT OF THE SORBUS AUCUPARIA IS DENOMINATED BY HIM SORBIC ACID IN ORDER TO DISTINGUISH IT FROM OTHER KNOWN VEGETABLE ACIDS TO PREPARE IT HE PRESSES THE RIPE FRUIT PREVIOUSLY BRUISED INR A LINEN BAG AND THEREBY OBTAINS NEARLY HALF ITS WEIGHT OF JUICE WITH THIS JUICE HE MIXES A SOLUTION OF ACETATE OF LEAD AND OBTAINS A PRECIPITATE OF SORBATE OF LEAD WHICH REQUIRES TO BE FREQUENTLY WASHED WITH COLD WATER THE PURIFIED POWDER IS THEN BOILED IN A LARGE QUAN TITY OF WATER WHICH DISSOLVES A PART AS A SUPERSORBATE LEAVING UN DISSOLVED A SUBSORBATE THE LIQUOR BEING FILTERED AND SUFFERED TO COOL DEPOSITS BRILLIANT CRYSTALS OF PURIFIED SORBATE OF LEAD TO THE CRYSTALS THUS OBTAINED HE ADDS A QUANTITY OF DILUTE SULPHURIC ACID SUFFICIENT TO SEPARATE NEARLY THE WHOLE OF THE LEAD AND HAVING THEN SEPARATED THE REMAINDER BY A CURRENT OF SULPHURETTED HYDROGEN GAS HE OBTAINS THE ACID IN A STATE OF PURITY THE ACID TO WHICH THIS BEARS THE NEAREST RESEMBLANCE IS THE MALIC AND INDEED THESE TWO ACIDS APPEAR TO THE AUTHOR TO HAVE BEEN CON

J100688,ABSTRACTS OF THE PAPERS PRINTED IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,110179,ON THE LAWS OF THE DEVIATION OF MAGNETIZED NEEDLES TOWARDS IRON ABSTRACT,I207044,SWARM HAD ISSUED AND PROCEEDED DIRECTLY TO THE ONE WHICH HAD JUST SETTLED AND INSTANTLY UNITED WITH THEM THE AUTHOR IS LED FROM THESE AND OTHER FACTS TO CONCLUDE THAT SUCH UNIONS OF SWARMS ARE GE NERALLY IF NOT ALWAYS THE RESULT OF PREVIOUS CONCERT AND ARRANGE MENT THE AUTHOR PROCEEDS TO MENTION SOME CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH INDUCE HIM TO BELIEVE THAT SEX IS NOT GIVEN TO THE EGGS OF BIRDS OR TO THE SPAWN OF FISHES OR INSECTS AT ANY VERY EARLY PERIOD OF THEIR GROWTH FEMALE DUCKS KEPT APART FROM ANY MALE BIRD TILL THE PERIOD OF LAYING EGGS APPROACHED WHEN A MUSK DRAKE WAS PUT INTO COMPANY WITH THEM PRODUCED A NUMEROUS OFFSPRING SIX OUT OF SEVEN OF WHICH PROVED TO BE MALES THE MULE FISHES FOUND IN MANY RIVERS WHERE THE COMMON TROUT ABOUNDS AND WHERE A SOLITARY SALMON IS PRESENT ARE UNIFORMLY OF THE MALE SEX HENCE THE SPAWN MUST HAVE BEEN WITHOUT SEX AT THE TIME IT WAS DEPOSITED BY THE FEMALE THE AUTHOR STATES THAT HE HAS ALSO MET WITH ANALOGOUS CIRCUM STANCES IN THE VEGETABLE WORLD RESPECTING THE SEXES OF THE BLOSSOMS OF MONOECIOUS PLANTS WHEN THE HEAT IS EXCESSIVE COMPARED WITH THE QUANTITY OF LIGHT WHICH THE PLANT RECEIVES ONLY MALE FLOWERS AP PEAR BUT IF THE LIGHT BE IN EXCESS FEMALE FLOWERS ALONE ARE PRO DUCED ON THE LAWS OF THE DEVIATION OF MAGNETIZED NEEDLES TOWARDS IRON BY SAMUEL HUNTER CHRISTIE ESQ MA FRS C READ JUNE 5 1828 PHIL TRANS 1828 P 325 THE AUTHOR HAD POINTED OUT SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE LAW OF DEVI ATION OF A MAGNETIZED NEEDLE EITHER FREELY SUSPENDED OR CONSTRAINED TO MOVE IN ANY PARTICULAR PLANE FROM ITS NATURAL POSITION BY THE IN FLUENCE OF MASSES OF IRON IN ITS VICINITY THIS LAW WAS FOUNDED ON THE HYPOTHESIS THAT THE IRON ATTRACTED BOTH THE POLES OF THE NEEDLE THE POSITION OF WHICH RESULTING FROM THIS ACTION MIGHT BE DETER MINED BY THAT OF AN IMAGINARY MINUTE MAGNETIC NEEDLE FREELY SUS PENDED BY ITS CENTRE OF GRAVITY REDUCED TO THE PLANE OF REVOLUTION THE AUTHOR HAD CONSIDERED THIS LAW AS FULLY ESTABLISHED FROM ITS AC CORDANCE WITH EXPERIMENT BUT MR BARLOW IN A PAPER WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN THE LAST VOLUME OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS DENIES THAT SUCH AN ACCORDANCE EXISTS AND INFERS FROM THE RESULTS OF SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH HE MADE ON HORIZONTAL NEEDLES HAVING THEIR MAG NETISM UNEQUALLY DISTRIBUTED IN THEIR TWO BRANCHES THAT THE THEORY ON WHICH THE PRECEDING LAW IS FOUNDED IS FALLACIOUS IN OPPOSITION TO THE VIEWS OF MR BARLOW THE AUTHOR CONTENDS THAT THE PHENOMENA OBSERVED ARE PRECISELY THOSE WHICH MUST RESULT FROM THE THEORY HE HAD HIMSELF ADOPTED AND THAT THEY TEND IN NO WAY TO SUPPORT THE HYPOTHESIS OF THEIR BEING SIMPLY THE EFFECTS OF THE MAGNETIC POWER WHICH THE IRON RECEIVES BY INDUCTION FROM THE EARTH THE AUTHOR WAS ALSO LED TO SUSPECT THE ACCURACY OF ANOTHER CON CLUSION WHICH HAD BEEN DRAWN BY MR BARLOW NAMELY THAT THE3418 LENGTH OF THE NEEDLE HAD NO SENSIBLE INFLUENCE UPON THE EXTENT OF ITS DEVIATIONS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THIS POINT HE BEGAN BY ASCERTAIN ING MORE SCRUPULOUSLY THAN HAD YET BEEN DONE THE VALUES OF SEVERAL OF THE ELEMENTS OF THE CALCULATION SUCH AS THE EXACT POSITIONS OF THE POINTS WHERE THE INTENSITY OF THE MAGNETISM IS THE GREATEST AND ALSO OF THE POINT OF NEUTRALITY OR OF THE MAGNETIC CENTRE AND HE NEXT SUBJECTED TO A MORE SEVERE SCRUTINY A LAW WHICH HAD BEEN REGARDED AS ESTABLISHED BY EXPERIMENT NAMELY THAT THE TANGENT OF THE DEVI ATION IS PROPORTIONAL TO THE RECTANGLE OF THE COSINE OF THE LONGITUDE INTO THE SINE OF THE DOUBLE LATITUDE OF THE POSITION OF THE CENTRE OF THE NEEDLE WITH RELATION TO THE MASS OF IRON AS REFERRED TO A HOLLOW SPHERE IN THE COURSE OF HIS EXPERIMENTS THE AUTHOR ASCERTAINED THAT IF ANY BAR OF STEEL UNIFORMLY MAGNETIZED BY THE METHOD OF DOUBLE TOUCH HAVE THIS STATE OF MAGNETISM DISTURBED BY DRAWING THE END OF A MAG NET FROM ITS CENTRE TO THE END HAVING THE SAME POLARITY AS THAT AP PLIED TO IT THEN THE POLE AT THAT END WILL BE SHIFTED TOWARDS THE CENTRE WHILE THE OPPOSITE POLE WILL BE REMOVED FURTHER FROM IT AND A CORRESPONDING CHANGE WILL OCCUR IN THE POSITION OF THE MAGNETIC CENTRE CHANGES WILL ALSO TAKE PLACE IN THE ABSOLUTE INTENSITIES OF THE MAGNETISM AT EACH POLE CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCES WERE OBSERVED IN THE EXTENT OF THE DEVIATIONS OF A NEEDLE SIX INCHES IN LENGTH AND OF ONE OF TWO INCHES LONG WHEN SUCCESSIVELY PLACED IN THE SAME PO SITION WITH RELATION TO THE SHELL OF IRON AT THE DISTANCE OF 16 8 INCHES THEY AMOUNTED TO MORE THAN TWO DEGREES AND A HALF AND THE DIFFERENCE CONTINUED TO BE VERY SENSIBLE EVEN AT A DISTANCE OF 24 INCHES FROM THE SHELL IN GENERAL WHEN THE NEEDLES WERE NEAR TO THE NORTH OR SOUTH OF THE CENTRE OF THE SHELL THE DEVIATIONS OF THE LONGER NEEDLE EXCEEDED THOSE OF THE SHORTER AND THE REVERSE TOOK PLACE WHEN THE NEEDLES WERE PLACED ON THE EAST AND WEST SIDES HENCE HE CONCLUDES THAT THE EFFICACY OF A SMALL MASS OF IRON PLACED NEAR TO THE NEEDLE TO SERVE AS A COMPENSATION TO THE EFFECTS OF MORE DISTANT MASSES WILL DEPEND UPON ITS BEING ITSELF AT SUCH A DISTANCE FROM THE NEEDLE AS THAT THE DIFFERENCE OF ITS ACTION UPON A LONG AND A SHORT NEEDLE SHALL BE INSENSIBLE THE AUTHOR PROCEEDS TO DEDUCE FROM THE LAW WHICH HE HAS PRO POSED VARIOUS FORMS OF EQUATIONS FOR DETERRMINING THE DEVIATIONS OF A HORIZONTALNEEDLE DUE TO THE ACTION OF AN IRON SPHERE OR SHELL APPLI CABLE TO DIFFERENT CIRCUMSTANCES AND CONDITIONS OF THE CASE IN ONE SET OF EQUATIONS ACTIONS AND RESULTING POSITIONS ARE REFERRED TO THREE RECTANGULAR COORDINATES PROCEEDING FROM THE CENTRE OF THE NEEDLE AND IN ANOTHER SET THEY ARE REFERRED TO POLAR COORDINATES RELATIVE TO THE VERTICAL AND TO THE PLANE OF THE HORIZON HE NEXT DEDUCES EQUA TIONS FOR COMPUTING THE DEVIATIONS OF A NEEDLE IN WHICH THE MAG NETISM HAS BEEN DISTURBED BY APPLYING TO ONE OF ITS POLES THE CORRE SPONDING POLE OF A MAGNET HE THEN PROCEEDS TO THE DETAIL OF EX PERIMENTS FOR INVESTIGATING THE ABOVEMENTIONED LAWS AND TO THEIR COMPARISON WITH THE RESULTS DEDUCED FROM THEORY THESE EXPERI MENTS APPEAR TO HIM TO ESTABLISH BEYOND ALL DOUBT THE INFLUENCEWHICH THE LENGTH OF A NEEDLE HAS ON ITS DEVIATIONS PRODUCED BY THE ATTRACTION OF THE SHELL OF IRON WHEN EXAMINED BY THE TEST OF THE FORMULAE GIVEN BY THE AUTHOR THE LAW OF THE TANGENT OF THE DEVI ATION BEING PROPORTIONAL TO THE RECTANGLE OF THE COSINE OF THE LONGI TUDE INTO THE SINE OF THE DOUBLE LATITUDE ON WHICH SO MUCH DEPEND ANCE HAD BEEN PLACED IS FOUND TO GIVE RESULTS SO INCONSISTENT WITH ONE ANOTHER THAT IT CANNOT BE CONSIDERED AS EVEN AFFORDING AN AP PROXIMATION TO THE TRUTH AND MUST THEREFORE BE WHOLLY REJECTED THE CLOSE AGREEMENT WHICH THE AUTHOR FOUND BETWEEN THE OB SERVED AND THE COMPUTED DEVIATIONS OF NEEDLES WHOSE MAGNETISM HAD BEEN DISTURBED BY CONTACT WITH A MAGNET AS WELL AS THOSE WHICH HAD SUFFERED NO DISTURBANCE FULLY CONFIRMED THE AUTHOR IN THE VIEWS WHICH HE ORIGINALLY TOOK OF THE ACTION OF IRON ON MAGNETIZED NEEDLES HE CONCEIVES THAT HIS HYPOTHESIS INSTEAD OF BEING AT VARIANCE WITH OBSERVATION IS NOT ONLY CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE EXPERIMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BUT BY AFFORDING THE PROPER CORRECTIONS TO BE APPLIED TO THEM DERIVES THE STRONGEST SUPPORT FROM THESE OBSERVATIONS HE CONCLUDES BY MENTIONING A FACT WHICH HE CONCEIVES TO BE IRRE CONCILEABLE WITH THE HYPOTHESIS OF INDUCED MAGNETISM NAMELY THAT A STEEL BAR RENDERED AS HARD AS IT WAS POSSIBLE TO MAKE IT PRODUCED WHEN ITS ENDS ARE REVERSED PRECISELY THE SAME EFFECT ON THE NEEDLE AS A BAR OF THE SOFTEST IRON UNDER SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIPTION OF A SOUNDING BOARD IN ATTERCLIFFE CHURCH INVENTED BY THE REV JOHN BLACKBURN MINISTER OF ATTERCLIFFECUMDARNALL SHEF FIELD READ JUNE 5 1828 PHIL TRANS 1828 P 361 THE CHURCH AT ATTERCLIFFE HAD LONG BEEN REMARKABLE FOR THE DIFFI CULTY AND INDISTINCTNESS WITH WHICH A VOICE FROM THE PULPIT WAS HEARD THESE DEFECTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY REMEDIED BY THE ERECTION OF A CONCAVE SOUNDINGBOARD HAVING THE FORM RESULTING FROM HALF A REVO LUTION OF ONE BRANCH OF A PARABOLA ON ITS AXIS IT IS MADE OF PINE WOOD ITS AXIS IS INCLINED FORWARDS TO THE PLANE OF THE FLOOR AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 10 OR 15 IT IS ELEVATED SO THAT THE SPEAKERS MOUTH MAY BE IN THE FOCUS AND A SMALL CURVILINEAR PORTION IS REMOVED ON EACH SIDE SO THAT THE VIEW OF THE PREACHER FROM THE SIDE GALLERIES MAY NOT BE INTERCEPTED A CURTAIN IS SUSPENDED FROM THE LOWER EDGE FOR ABOUT 18 INCHES ON EACH SIDE THE EFFECT OF THIS SOUNDINGBOARD HAS BEEN TO INCREASE THE VOLUME OF SOUND TO NEARLY FIVE TIMES WHAT IT WAS BEFORE SO THAT THE VOICE IS NOW AUDIBLE WITH PERFECT DISTINCTNESS EVEN IN THE REMOTEST PARTS OF THE CHURCH AND MORE ESPECIALLY IN THOSE PLACES WHICH ARE SITUATED IN THE PROLONGATION OF THE AXIS OF THE PARABOLOID BUT THE SIDE GAL LERIES ARE ALSO BENEFITED PROBABLY FROM THE INCREASE OF THE SECON DARY VIBRATIONS IN A LATERAL DIRECTION SEVERAL EXPERIMENTS ARE RE LATED ILLUSTRATIVE OF THESE EFFECTS AMONG WHICH THE MOST STRIKING WAS ONE IN WHICH A PERSON PLACED SO AS TO HAVE ONE EAR IN THE FOCUS OF THE PARABOLOID AND THE OTHER TOWARDS ANOTHER PERSON SPEAKING

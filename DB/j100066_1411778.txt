j100066,The American Journal of Psychology,1411778,Notes and News,i261599,NOTES AND NEWS EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY IN ENGELAND There are signs that England is at last falling into line with other nations in the matter of Experimental Psychology At Cambridge two rooms in the Cavendish Laboratory have for some time past been devoted to psychophysical work and it is now rumored that a modest laboratory is to be set up on an independent footing and a University Lecturership established with a salary of 250 Ef forts are also being made by Professor Sully and others to give the science independent status at University College London Lec tures upon special departments of psychophysics have been deliv ered for two or three years iELooms are now offered for temporary use by Professor Carey Foster of the physical department a sum of 350has been contributed for the purchase of instruments and it is hoped that sufficient funds may be raised to secure the serv ices of a trained demonstrator for at least one term of the academic year Subscriptions may be sent to the Hampstead Branch of the London  Southwestern Bank account Psychological Labora tory University College While this news must be welcome to e2rperimental psychologists the world over it is to be hoped that English men of science will not rest satisfied with the success of so limited a program An ef ficient laboratory requires nowadays an initial endowment of at least 2000 and a yearly income of at least 500 more Moreover though psychology owes a great debt of gratitude to physiology and physics for the hospitable reception accorded to it in these two cases there can be no doubt that such affiliation however tem porary tends to weaken its claim to independence in the minds of the nonelect This is abundantly shown by the results of the hos pitality offered to homeless psychologists by the Physiological Laboratory at Oxford Experimental psychology is not phys iology it cannot be taught by a physiologist its methods and much of its apparatus are peculiar to itself The be ginnings at Cambridge and London must therefore be re garded as the thin end of a wedge whose potential broadening is as considerable as that of say physical chemistry or bac teriology May it be driven deeply and per6istently  PSYCHOLOGY IN THE COLLEGE CURRICULUM The above remarks call to mind a statement made by Professor Jastrow in a recent number of Science June 4 1897 to the effect that  psychology has a very unfortunate reputation in the mind of the college student as a study peculiarly difficult to be pursued by methods unusual and intricate It would be interesting toF584 NOTES AND NEWS know first whether this statement really holds and secondly whether in cases where it does hold its truth is not referable to the fact that psychology is taught along oldfashioned lines The writers experience is that when stress is laid upon the perform ance of introspective e2rercises by the student and the lecture se ries enlivened by e2rperimental demonstrationpsychology yieids to but few studies in point of attractiveness rivaling even subjects so intrinsically interesting as physiology while its difflculty is no greater and may be less than that of some of the other old established features of the college curriculum A PSYaHOPHYSICAL VOCABULARY The following translations are additions to or

Gesammtvorstellung aggregate idea Randcontrast marginal contrast Scharfe accuracy acuteness Zwangs imperative The whole vocabulary should be compared with the glossary ap pended by Professor Wundt and Dr Judd to the English transla tion of Wundts Grundrss It is noteworthy that Wundt has ap proved affective as the equivalent of Gemuths On the other hand the rendering of Gebtide by  compound  is not only inade quate but in places becomes selfcontradictory The geological association of the term  formation  seems to be at least harm less NEWS Mr J F Crawford has been appointed Demonstrator in

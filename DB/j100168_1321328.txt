home port Held that the process was one in rem and enforceable exclusively in the Federal District Courts and the State Courts had no jurisdiction The Glide I7 Sup Ct Rep 930 Atlantic Works v Tug Glide 157 Mass 525 reversed The reasoning is briefly stated at the end of the opinion By the laws of the United States the Federal District Courts have exclusive maritime and admiralty jurisdiction the lien oin a vessel is ajus iz re and a maritime lien to secure the performance of a maritime contract and equally within the maritime jurisdiction whether created by the common law or by statute Although the common law gave a lien for repairs furnished a foreign vessel and the Federal courts had exclusive jurisdiction The Moses Taylor 4 Wall 411 it gave none for those furnished to a home vessel Such a lien if it existed would be enforced in the same way and be subject to the same jurisdiction as one ex isting without a statute Atlantic Works v Tuig Glide supra Morton J dissenting The statute gives the cause of action the exclusive jurisdiction existed before The characteristic opinion by Mr Justice Gray presents a full review of the authorities CONSTITUTIONAL LAW COLLATERAL ATTACKDE FACTO OFFICER A was convicted in a city police court created under a statute which was unconstitutional be cause it did not properly classify municipal corporations On petition for habeas corpus held that the constitutionality of the statute was open and that A was entitled to release as the police court having no legal existence the judge was not a defacto officer and his acts were void Exparte Giambonini 49 Pac Rep 732 Cal While professing to follow Buck v City of Eureka IO9 Cal 504 the judge really disregards the rule which he himself laid down in that case There a statute aulthorized a council to create an office to be filled in a certain manner The office was not created but a person appointed in the manner specified acted as officer and was generally recog nized as such lie was held to be a defacto officer as the office had a potential exist ence under the statute In the principal case it was not claimed that a city police court could not exist under the Constitution the only objection to the statute was that it contained improper classifications It is hard to see any more potential existence in anRECENAT CASES 267 office which a statute authorizes a council to create than in one which a constitution authorizes the legislature to create By the same principle of public policy the acts of the officers under the statute and under the Constitution should be protected from col lateral attack State v Cartoll 38 Conni 449 State v Gardner 54 Ohio St 24 A very different question arises if the legislature attempts to substitute a statutory office for

ascertain whether or not the legislature in the passage of a bill complied with the requirements of the Constitution the couirt may go back of the enrolled bill to see if the journals of both houses of the legislature show that the requirements of the Constitution were obeyed Cohn v Kingsley 49 Pac Rep 985 Idaho An enrolled act signed by the proper officers and filed in the office of the Secretary of State will be held to have been enacted as enrolled though the legislative journals show that in its progress through the legislature an amendment was adopted which is not included in the enrolled act McKennon v Cotner 49 Pac Rep 956 Oreg The above cases brinig out sharply the divergence of opinion which exists as to the effect which should be given the enrolment of a statute See IO HARVARD LAW RE VIEW 380 The only view which can be supported on sound principle is that the certificate of enrolment is unassailable by the journals of the legislature whether to show an omission of an anmendment or afailure to comply with some form required by the Constitution This doctrine does not deny the right of the judiciary to declare a law unconstitutional under fitting circumstances  it simply requires the court to re spect the only evidence which can lroperly be before it  the solemnly authenticated record of the legislature That body as it has the power to pass a law must neces sarily have as an incident the right of directing what shall be the supreme evidence of its authenticity For the judiciary to permit the record to be controlled by journals which from the nature of things are likely to be irregular and inaccurate does not comport with decency of procedure and with the respect due to coordinate departments of governinent Pangborn v Young 32 N J Law 29 CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  JURISDICTION  ADMINIST RATION OF ESTATE OF SUP POSED DEAD MAN  Held that a statute authorizing a probate court to administer the goods of a man who has not been beard of for seven years as if he were dead and making that administration good even in case he turns out tobe alive is unconstitutional as depriving a man of his property without due process of l aw Carr v Brown 38 Atl

deprived without due process of law Hoover v McChesney 81 Fed Rep 472 See NOTES CONTRACTS INSURANCE PROVISION FOR ARBITRATION Held that a pro vision in an insuranice policy requiring the settlement out of court of all questions in dispute arising under it is not invalid as ousting the jurisdiction of the court Raymonzd v Fazmers Ins Co 72 N W Rep 254 Mich Robinson v Temiplar Lodge 49 Pac Rep 170 Cal It was suggested under the same heading in II HARVARD LAW REVIEW 127 that the hostility of the courts to provisionis for arbitration is gradually breaking down It would be hard to find better illustrations of this than the above cases CRIMINAL LAW FORMER JEOPARDY The defendant was tried on an indict ment for murder in the first degree and was found guilty of murder in the second degree Held he could be tried again for the higher offence after the verdict had been set aside on his own nmotion State v Kessler 49 Pac 293 Utah The weight of authority on this point is contra I Bishop New Criminal Law ioo6 The generally accepted doctrine is that a conviction for an offence less than the highest charged is an acquittal of every higher degree of the offence and that by moving for a new trial the defendant waives his constitutional defence of former jeopardy only in respect to the issue which has been found againist him CRIMINAL LAW  PERJURY INCRIMINATING TESTIMONY Held that a wit ness in a pension examination who is maniifestly ignorant of his constitutional right to keep silent as to incriminiating matters and who is not informed of it canniot be con victed of perjury on subjects as to which he might have kept silent United States v Bell 8i Fed Rep 830 In Counselman v Hitchcock 142 U S 547 the provision in the Fifth Amendment as to the privilege of a witness was construed very liberally on the ground that it ex268 HARVARD LA W REVIEW presses an ancient and fundamental principle of English and American liberty That this view is unsound historically see I Jur Soc P 456 and 5 HARVARD LAW REVIEW 71 In the principal case the provision is construed even more liberally It seems strainied to construe a privilege not to testify as to crimes already committed into a grant of immunity from crimes not yet committed It may seem a little hard to con vict an ignorant man who not knowing his rights swore falsely but it is submitted that the mitigating circumstances in this case are more properly considered in connection with the senitence to be imposed or an appeal to the pardoning power than in de ciding on the rule of law DAMAGES  BREACI OF PROMISE OF MARRIAGE  AGGRAVATION  In an action for breach of pronmise of marriage defendlant pleads as a justification unchastity in the woman and fails to prove his plea Held though the plea was not made in bad faith the damages might be aggravated on account of it lIhe plea is on the record and will remain there as a continiued reiteration of the charge against the lplaintiff and therefore a triflinig verdict would not show that such charge was unfounded Kaufmlian v Fyc 42 S W Rep 25 Tenn It is true that plaintiff suffers as much injury from such a charge being placed on the record in good faith as if it were done in bad faith But this is a question of ex emplary not of compensatory damages and to punish defendant for a bonafide plea is to put a penalty upon an honest enideavor to defend a suit This consideration would seem to require a different result even if the court is right in saying that the ground for aggravating the damages is that the plea is on record But it may well be doubted if this is the true ground It was decided in Knziffen v McCoinell 30 N V 285 that the introduction of this class of evidence under the general issue might be considered in aggravation of damages That case could not rest upon the reason urged in the prini cipal case for there was no special plea on the record Moreover the result in the prinicipal case is contrary to the reasoning on which exemplary damages are allowed in general viz to puniish defendant because he has acted maliciously A plea made in good faith has no tendency to show defendant in such a light 2 Sedgwick on Dam ages 8th ed  640 DAMAGES PROSPFCTIVECONTINUING TRESPASS A railroad built its tracks on a street under a license from the city Plaintiff was an abuttilng ownler but pur chased after the building of the road Held that he was entitled to recover the amounlt of damages accruing year by year as for a continuinlg trespass Hoffman v F  P AS R R Co 72 N W Rep I67 Mich This wotuld seem to be a case of a permanent legal structure for if necessary in order to prevent removal of the tracks by legal process the company can take plain tiffs easement by condemnationi proceedings Technically the trespass is a continuilng one and damages can be recovered to the date of the writ only Pond v Met Elev Ry Co II2 N Y i86 But on practical grounds it would seem better to regard the injury as a permanent one and allow all damages past and prospective to be recovered in one action Stodehill v C B  Q A R Co 53 Iowa 34I As a mattes of fact all the damages are suffered at once There is a permanent depreciation in value which has to be reckoned with in selling the prolerty That the judgmenit legalizes that which before was a wrong is no more thani is done by satisfaction of the judgment in the ordinary case of conversion EQUITY  BILL TO GET POSSESSION OF LAND  Held that one in whose favor a decisioni has been rendered in a contest before the United States Land Department may maintain a bill in equity to obtain possession of part of the land involved of which he has never been in possession and which has for a long time been occupied by the other party though the latter charges that the decision of the Land Office was obtained by fraud Barnes v Newton 48 Pac Rep I90 Okl dissenting opinion 49 Pac Rep I074 Woodruff v Wallace 4I Pac Rep 357 Okl followed The ground of the court for takinig juirisdiction is that the remedy at law by action of forcible entry and detainer is slower than the remedy in equity While this reason may justify the issuance of a preliminary injunction at the suit of one in possession to prevent irreparable injury by a destructive trespass it is doubtful if it should be ap plied where as in the principal case the plainitiff is out of possession and no danger of irreparable injury is shown On the questions of fact involved in anl action to get possessioni of land it has always been considered that each party has a right to a jury trial and even where equity has taken jurisdiction it has directed a trial at law under the equity courts control An assumption of jurisdiction by equity which takes away this right to trial by jury should be made only with the greatest cautioni and as the dissenting judge points out the authorities cited by the majority hardly justify it in the principal caseRECENT CASES 269 EVIDENCE  DOCUMENTS  NOTICE TO PRODUCE  The defendant was indicted under a statute for the misuse of public funds Checks were traced into his posses sion Held that the prosecution might initroduce secondary evidence of their contents without first giving notice to the defendant to produce them State v McCauley 49 Pac Rep 221 Wash The reasoning of the court that notice is not necessary because the defendant can not be compelled to produce cannot be supported Notice is given for the purpose of allowinig the opposite party an opportuniity to produce anid must be giveni unless the proceeditngs are themselves a notice This was not shown to be the case here The court cites 3 Rice on Ev p 45 for the proposition that notice need not be given  if the evidence in the case shows the docuiment to be in the defendants possession T he cases supposed to support this exception are all cases where the indictment is for larceny of the paper in question or for forgery and are therefore not in point The opinion is short and gives the impression that the court does not thinik that questions of evidence are worthy of investigation EVIDENCE  RIGHT OF STATE TO IMPEACH ITS OWN WITNESSES  Held that the State may impeach its own witnesses in criminal cases State v Slack 38 Atl Rep 31I Vt See NOTES EXECUTIONS  APPLICATION OF PROCEEDS  Defendant a sheriff collected a sum of moniey on an execution in favor of plaintiff and applied part of it oni a tax warrant against plaintiff then in his hands for collection Held that plaintiff could recover the amounit so applied Eaton v McElhone 49 Pac Rep 695 Kan The reasoniing in support of the decision is that money in the hands of a sheriff collected on an execution is in the custody of the law and therefore is not subject to levy or garnishment The force of this argument was clear when the sheriff was re quired actually to bring the money into court with the return of the writ Now how ever the reason of the ruile seems to fail for the officer regularly pays it over at once to the judgment creditor and could immediately levy on it again It seems proper to reach the same result without such a useless proceeding by allowing the sheriff to levy at once on the money while in his own hands This view has been takeln in Vermont New Hampshire New Jersey and Tenniessee though the great weight of authority beginning with Turner v Fetdaal I Cranch I I7 is with the principal case See Free man on Executions  I30 and nlote GARNISHMENT  EXECUTORS AS GARNISHEES  A was indebted to B who recov ered a judgment against As executors C a creditor of B attempted to garnish As executors The executors filed a disclosure in which they admitted the judgment and that the money was in their hands ready to be paid to those entitled to it No order of distribution had been made by the probate court Held that the executors could not be garnished Two judges dissenting Hudson v Wilber 72 N W Rep 162 Mich The authorities are practically unanimous in support of this case These authori ties rest on two grounds viz that the executors liability is not a debt or property within the garnishmenit statutes and that the money being in the hands of ani officer of the court is in the custody of the law and canniot be reached by an order from an other court The rule is not confined to executors and administrators but applies to receivers assignees in bankruptcy and similar officers of court In most jurisdictions garnishment is allowed after final decree of the court appointing such officer because it is said that the liability of the executor has then become fixed But the soundness of such a result may be doubted The court orders the executor to distribute the funds in a certain way and to allow a different court to change this order would seem to be against public policy For authorities see Rood on Garnishment  27 et seq INSURANCE  CHANGE OF OWNFRSHIP  BREACH OF CONDITIONS  A policy of fire insurance with the usual mortgage clause attached stipulated that the mortgagees should notify the insurer of any change of ownership that came within the mortgagees knowledge A change of ownership occurred between the application for insurance by the mortgagees and the delivery of the policy Held that a failure to notify the insurer did niot avoid the policy Pioneer Savinbs  Loan Co v Ins Co 49 Pac Rep 231 XWash The violation of a condlition in a policy of insurance either avoids the policy or has no effect whatever There is no half way ground and the reasoning of the court that the breach of such a condition sounds in damages simply is utterly untenable See May oii Ins 3d ed  156 et seq Btit considering the well recognized temper of courts in construing policies strongly against the insurer Western c v Home Jns Co 145 Pa St 346 the decision may possibly be supported on the ground that the property had changed hands before it was insured and if the insurance company desired to be 36270 HARVARD LAW REVIEW notified of a change of ownership between the application and the issuance of the pol icy they shotuld have stipulated for it Day v Ins Co 72 Iowa 597 That is when they issued the policy they insured the property as it then was Dooly v Zlis Co i6 Wash 155 Although other reasons are often advanced for such strict construction of policies by modern courts it is submitted that the onily sound ones are first the commonlaw rule applicable to all promises in writing and secondly that the insur ance company is an expert in the business MORTGAGES  ACTION OF TORT FOR WRONGFUL SALE UNDER A POWER  Held that a mortgagee who wrongfully exercised a power of sale before default is liable to the mortgagor in an action of tort for the full value of the land although the purchaser from the mortgagee holds subject to the mortgagors right to redeem Rogers v Barites 47 N E Rep 602 Mass See NOTES PERSONSALIENATION OF HUSBANDS AFFECTIONS Ield a married woman can maintain an action against persons who wrongfully entice her husband from her and alienate his affections Lockwood v Lockwood 70 N W Rep 784 Minn The gist of this action is the loss of consortium There seems to be some doubt whether the wife could maintain the action at common law Lynch v Kiiiht 9 H L Cas 577 But since by statute the wife is now permitted to sue for her own benefit for personal wrongs done her this action is allowed her in most jurisdictions See Cooley on Torts 2d ed 228 The Maine and Wiscotnsin courts have however denied the wife this remedy Doe v Roe 82 Me 503 Dujies v Dufties 76 Wis 374 PERSONS  MARRIAGE  FRAUD Held concealment by a woman from her hus band at the time of her marriage of the fact that she is pregnant by another man does not render the marriage void Moss v Moss 1897 P 263 In the course of a well reasoned and technical opinion the court discusses early English textwriters and dicta in support of its view and a number of American authorities opposed to it of which the leading case is Reynolds v Reynolds 3 Allen 605 The decision in the latter case is based upon the ground that pregnancy by another at the time of marriage is in violation of the essentialia of marriage because the wife is incapacitated from bearing her husband children and he is forced to choose between receiving into his family a child tnot his or asserting that his wife is unchaste The court in the principal case following the criticism of Bishop on Marriage  483 499 argues that the disability is temporary only and that the presumption of legiti macy although strong is rebuttable and if the husband does rebut it he is in no worse plight than if he unwittingly had married merely an unchaste woman for which it is well settled that he cannot have the marriage declared void Although Bishop is inclined to justify the result of Reynolds v Reynolds supra on grounds of public policy the court logically refuses to follow him and adheres strictly to the principle that actual consent alone is essential and that fraud inducing the consent is immaterial Ayliffes Parergon 362 PLEADING ABATEMENT PENDENCY OF ANOTHER ACTION FOR SAME CAUSE A plea in abatement alleging that another action for the same cause was pending at the commencement of the suit but not at the filinlg of the plea was held properly overruled Winnerv Kuehn 72 N WV Rep 227 Wis The decision follows Bates v Chesebro 32 Wis 594 and overrules a dictum in Le Clerc v Wood 2 Pinney 37 Some authorities hold that every action commenced during the pendency of another for the same cause is vexatious and must abate Parker v Colcord 2 N H 36 The Wisconsin court conceded this to have been the strict commonlaw rule but apart from a statement in l Bac Abr tit Abatement M 65 little direct Eniglish authority can be found for such a proposition Cf Greenz v Watts I Lcl Ray 274 The earlier cases discuss in what actions a plea of lispendens might be filed in abatement of the writ before declaration made but do not decide the present question Sparrys Case 5 Co 6r According to the principles of common law procedure it is difficult to see how a plaintiff can succeed in an action in which he was not entitled to recover at the time it was brought but to compel him to institute another would produce that multiplicity of suits which the defence of lis pendens was designed to prevent It is not surprising therefore that the doctrine of the principal case is accepted in most of the United States Leavitt v Mowe 54 Md 613 PROPERTY  RIPARIAN RIGHTS  DIVERSION BY GRANTEE  An upper riparian proprietor granted to the defendant a nonriparian owner a right to lay pipe across his land for the purpose of taking water This use slightly diminished the supply of water of the plaintiff a lower proprietor Held that the use of the water was appur tenant to the riparian land and as against the plaintiff the defendant had nlo right toRECENT CASES 271 divert the water and that the court would enjoin him from so doing without regard to the amount of the plaintiffs injury GouZd v Eiton 49 Pac Rep 577 Cal The case is exactly like Ormerod v Todmorden Mill Co i i Q B D 155 172 where Bowen L J approving Stockport Weterworks Co v Potter 3 H  C 300 says  The right of the riparian owner may be compared to a right of common appurtenant for cattle levant and couchant upon the land this right cannot be aliened from the land See to the saine effect Garwood v R R Co 83 N Y 400 where the defendant although a riparian owner was enjoined from using the water to supply its locomo tives because it was not used up on the land The court also implies that there must be some inijury to the plaintiff Elliot v Fitchlburg R R Co io Cush i9I But whether an injunction should be granted for a slight injury is questionable Earl of Sandwich v Greazt Northern R R Co IO Ch Div 707 and an action at law would have served as well to prevent the running of the Statute of Limitations PROPERTY  REVOCATION OF LICENSE BREACH OF CONTRACT  Plaintiff and defenidant agreed that defendant should let his wall to plaintiff for billposting at a certain sum per annum In an actioni of contract for withdrawing the pernmission it was held that although the license was revocable this action was maintainable Kerrison v Smzith 1897 2 Q B 454 The decision is undoubtedly sound and is probably law in this country as well as in England The argument on the other side is that the plaintiff paid for a revocable license and that having received what he bargained for he should not be heard to complain because the licensorexercised his option to revoke It is far more probable however that the latter contracted not to exercise this option  and this was probably what the court had in mind when it said that the trial judge should not have non suited the plaintiff but should  have gone on with the trial in order to ascertain what the contract really was The case of Wells v KingstonuponHull L R io C P 402 involved the same question but the point was rather assumed than decided PUBLIC OFFICER LIABILITY FOR PUBLIC MONEYS  Where a city treasurer pursuanit to statutes requirinig him to deposit city funds exercised prudence in the selec tion of a banik of good standinig wherein to deposit the funds and was free from negli genice in permitting them to remain there held he was not liable for the loss of the funds by the failure of the bank City of Livdzingston v Woods 49 Pac Rep 437 Mont In an action on the official statutory bond of a county treasurer for public moneys collected by him held that the fact that the moneys were deposited in a solvent bank ing institutioni which failed and caused loss was no defenice Gartly v People 49 Pac Rep 272 Colo Goddard J dissentinig It is interesting to find in the same volume of the reporter another decision on each side of this important question about which there is such conflict They discuss the four existing theories and carefully analyze the authorities T he prinicipal cases rest on opposite views of the broad question of a public officers liability for public moneys But the second case is weakened by a strongly reasoned dissenting opiniion and the first by the existence of the statute requiring the funds to be deposited which one of the judges very properly considers sufficient to decide the case See IO HARVARD LAw REVIEW 126 386 for other late decisions and collection of authorities STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS  ACTION ON

four years Oni her return B brings an action against A on her bond joining her sureties The period of limitation on contracts in writing is five years oni  a liability created be statuite three years No statute has run in favor of A because of her absence Held that the action against the sureties is on  a liability created by statute and is therefore barred Dizavis v Clark 49 Pac Rep 665 Kan A suretys liability is generally measured by the instrument that he signs Brandt on Suretyship  93 and the application of the three years Statute of Limitations in the principal case seems strained The court cites as its authority Ryus v Gruble 31 Kan 767 and Commissioners v Van Slyck 52 Kan 622 See also State v Blake 2 Ohio r47 accord These cases take the ground that an officers bond is merely collateral secuirity and that if the action on the principal obligation arising out of his duty as an officer is barred by any Statute of Limitations then the security is no longer in force Assuming that the lapse of the statutory period not only bars the remedy but also extinguishes the right as some courts have held these cases may be supported But they hardly furnish authority for the prinicipal case where no statute has run in favor of the administratrix because of her absence from the State TORTS  ACTION FOR DEATH  MEASURE OF DAMAGES  Plaintiffs brought ac tion against defendant for negligently causing the death of their thirteen year old son272 HARVARD LAW REVIEW Held that the jury are not restricted to an allowance for the value of the sons services during minority but may take into consideration pecuniary benefits which the parents may reasonably be expected to receive from him after reaching his majority Atchison c R R Co v Cross 49 Pac Rep 599 Kan The conflict of authority on this point seems hopeless and Sedgwick and Suther land take opposite sides The weight of decided cases is apparently with Sedgwick anid against the above ruling but the argument from the analogy of cases where re covery is allowed for the death of persons not minors is equally strong the other way The grounid of recovery there is not a legal right to services or support but reason

these facts would not entitle plaintiff to recover as the voluntary act of a third party B intervened between de fendants act and plaintiffs damage especially as it was not shown that Bs act was reasonable McDonald v Edwards 46 N Y Supp 672 The court makes the case turn squarely on the question of legal cause and adopts the doctrinie of Vica s v Wicocks 8 East I and Lynch v Knight 9 H L Cas 577 cases which have been severely criticised on this point It is hard to see why the in tervening act of a third party should break the causal connectioin when that act was intentionially brought

although an implied power of revocation of the trust remained in B which he might have exercised had he recovered Tusch v German Savings Bank 46 N Y SuPP 422 The decision is sound but the reasoning seems erroneous It would be contrary to all legal principles and precedents to tranisform a power of attorney ilnto a deed and there is no need of attempting it although the court seems to think a deed necessary to establish a trust and to give the trustee title to the book A savings bank book is like a certificate of stock a chose in action There was here merely the gratuitous transfer of a chose accompanied with an express power of attorney which was irrevocable because coupled with an interest viz the legal title to the book itself which passed on delivery and is not merged in the chose in action But the power of attorney by its terms contained a declaration of trust Pwas therefore entitled to the money but it would be subject to a trust See Larrabee v Hascall 88 Me 511 where

of equity to bring about a transfer of legal title from one to another unless it has obtained jurisdiction of the holder of the title To avoid these various legislative acts have been passed in

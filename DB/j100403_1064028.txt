Also where the consent was obtained by means of a sham marriage it was rape Lee v State 44 Tex Cr Rep 354 72 S W 1005 DIVORCERECRIMINATIONMIISCONDUCT RESULT OF ACTS OF OTHER PARTY A husband guilty of adultery sued for a divorce for his wifes de sertion Held though the statutory period of desertion had elapsed be fore the adultery was committed and though the adultery was a re sult of the abandonment the husband may not obtain a divorce Green v Green Md 93 Atl 400 It was argued that the rights of the husband to a divorce had be come vested by the lapse of the statutory period of desertion and could not be divested by his subsequent misconduct This position is clearly untenable striking at the roots of the doctrine of recrimination It has never been denied that adultery by the plaintiff is a valid defense to a suit charging the defendant with the same offense If the princi ple contended for in this case were established the right to a divorce would vest at the commission of the first act of adultery for which there is of course no time limit and the defense of recrimination would be unavailable Stress was also laid upon the alleged causal relation between the desertion and the husbands adultery the act of the woman being the inciting cause it was said of the husbands offense There are not many cases involving this precise point If the misconduct of one party is actually the proximate cause of that of the other spouse the latters misconduct callnot be taken advantage of So where a husband and wife separated by mutual consent the wife being given only from 2 to 4 a month for her support it was held that the husbands conduct was the proximate cause of acts of adultery committed by the wife and the bill for divorce was dismissed Hawkins v Hawkins 10 P D 177 Where the wife was a drug fiend and companion of prostitutes though not herself unchaste and neglect and nonsupport on the husband shown the husbands bill was dismissed the court saying The party com plaining has been instrumental in producing the causes leading to the separation Finley v Finley 8 Ky L Rep 605 2 S W 554 In a re cent New York case the point was made that the plaintiffs own con duct abandonment justified the adultery for which he sought a di vorce but the suggestion was expressly repudiated Mattison v Mat tison 60 Misc 573 113 N Y Supp 1024 Where the plaintiff was sentenced to life imprisonment and his wife later committed adultery he was held entitled to a divorce Abshire v Hanks 119 Ia 425 44 South 186 It would seem that each case must be decided on its own facts cer tainly the precedents do not constitute a rule of law that abandonment is an excuse for adultery See 2 BISH MARR DIV and SEP  212 362 INSURANCEIFE INSURANCESUICIDE OF THE INSUREDThe insured in good faith took out a life insurance policy containing no stipulationsVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW as to the effect of suicide and payable to the plaintiff as beneficiary He committed suicide while sane Held the plaintiff cannot recover Se curity Life Ins Co v Dillard Va 84 S E 656 There can be no recovery on a policy not making suicide an excepted risk if the insurance was procured with the intent to commit suicide for such concealment avoids the contract in which good faith is abso lutely essential Smith v National Benefit Society 123 N Y 85 25 N E 197 9 L R A 616 However the authorities are in irreconcilable conflict as to the effect of suicide while sane on such a policy taken out in good faith The principal case has the support of Federal and English authorities which base their views on the ground that the as sured does not assume the risk of such suicide and that it is contrary to public policy to allow a recovery Ritter v Mut Life Ins Co 169 U S 139 42 L Ed 693 Hopkins v Northwestern Life Ins Co C C A 94 Fed 729 See Moore v Woolsey 4 El  Bl 242 The great weight of State authority is opposed to this view on the ground that in the absence of a stipulation to the contrary the risk of suicide is assumed by the insurer and that the recovery is not contrary to public policy Morris v State Mut Life Ins Co 183 Pa St 563 39 Atl 52 Campbell v Supreme Conclave 66 N J L 274 49 Atl 550 54 L R A 576 Lange v Royal Highlanders 75 Neb 188 110 N W 1110 10 L R A N S 666 Some courts make a distinction between policies in which the beneficiary takes a vested interest and policies payable to the estate of the insured or in which the beneficiary has no vested interest as in those issued by fraternal societies In the latter cases no recovery is permitted on the ground that to do so would be to allow one to profit by his own wrong Shipman v Protected Home Circle 174 N Y 398 67 N E 83 63 L R A 347 Davis v Supreme Council Royal Arcanum 195 Mass 402 81 N E 294 But the distinction is disregarded by the weight of authority Supreme Conclave v Miles 92 Md 613 48 Atl 845 84 Am St Rep 528 See Parker v Des Moines Life Assn 108 Iowa 117 78 N W 826 And rightly so since the rights of all the parties are deter mined by the contract of insurance and the considerations of public pol icy are essentially the same whether the beneficiary holds a vested in terest in the policy or not or whether the policy is payable to the es tate of the insured or to a beneficiary RICHARDS INSURANCE 3 Ed  367 MASTER AND SERVANTAUTOMOBILESThe defendant having been driven in her automobile

Ward 7 Ill 285 interference with a ford formed part of the cause of action and in Harmon v Carter Tenn Ch App 1900 59 S VW 656 the sole injury complained of was making a ford impassable by water thrown back by a dam The instant case would seem to give the lower proprietor the right to have the volume of the stream remain constant unless the increase is due to a reason able exercise of Ithe right of drainage on the part of an upper proprietor as it does not appear that the stream was raised above its banks on the plaintiffs land In its opinion the court pays little attention to the nature of defendants wrong but rather lays emphasis on the character of plain tiffs right In commenting on one feature of this right the court said The particular right of the plaintiffs alleged to have been breached by defendant is the unhindered opportunity to pass from one place to another on their own land    If they own the land under the water called the ford they have the right to use it for a passage unobstructed by high waters If an owner has a right to be free from obstructions passing over the surface of his land from other property I TIFVANY REAL PROP  217 it does not seem unreasonable that he should have the right to be free from obstructions on the surface This however is an unusual way of approaching this class of cases WILLSWIHAT CONSTITUTES ACTUAL MILITARY SERVICE UNDER THE ENG LISH WILLS AcTAt the conclusion of the Waziristan operations lon the frontier of India in 1895 a portion of the force remained in the Toclhi Valley as an escort to the party engaged in

he dictated a will to his brotherinlaw whom Ihe made his residuary legatee The testator died the next day The will was signed by the testator and attested by his brotherinlaw and another officer as witnesses His estate consisted of personalty only Held that the testator was in actual military service within the meaning of  2 of the WILLS ACT 1837 at the time when he made his will Limond v Cunliffe 1915 2 Ch 240  2 of the WILLS ACT 1837 provides that any soldier being in actual mili tary service or any mariner or seaman being at sea may dispose of his per sonal estate as he might have done before the making of this Act The law prior to the Act allowed a soldier to dispose of Ihis personalty by a will no attestation of which was required at all I SWINBURNE TESTAMENTS 7th ed 94 The same privilege is now allowed them by statute in many of the states in this country A decision as to what constitutes actual military service is at this time peculiarly applicable and interesting under the present war conditions The court said For the purpose of determining whether a soldier is in actual military service the commencement of the military service is the time when mobilization takes place It does not cease until the full conclusion of the operations and also extends to those thingsl which are incidental to the war in question Such was the situation here The war had ceased and this soldier was killed while his regiment was serving as an 435MICHIGAN LAW REVIEW escort to the party engaged in the delimitation of the frontier For further cases on the point as to what constitutes the beginning and ending of actual military service see Herbert v Herbert I855 Deane Io In re Sauniders I865 L R I P  D 16 In re Tweedale 1874 L R 3 P  D 204 In re Hiscock 1901 Pro 78 Gattward v Knee 1902 Pro 99 Leathers v Greenacre 53 Me 561 Gould v Safford 39 Vt 498 It seems clear that the court is laying the foundation for a number of cases when it decides that even though engaged in something incidental to the war operations yet a soldier is deemed to be in actual service The question will naturally arise as to what things are incidenrtal WORKMENS COMPENSATION ACTBASIS

where the court or judge dispenses with publication thereof in a news paper It is provided that Code of Virginia  3230 On affidavit that a defendant is a nonresident of this state an order of pub lication may be entered against him Every order of pub lication under this section may be entered either by the court or by the clerk thereof in vacation  It is further provided that Code  3231 Every order of publica tion shall give the abbreviated style of the suit state briefly its ob ject and require the defendants against whom it is entered or the unknown parties to appear within fifteen days after due publication thereof and do what is necessary to protect their interests It shall be published once a week for four successive weeks in such news paper as the court may prescribe or if none is prescribed as the clerk may direct and shall be posted by the clerk at the front door of the courthouse of the county or corporation wherein the court is held on or before the next succeeding rule day after it is entered and the clerk shall file a certificate of the fact in the papers of the case but the cburt or judge thereof in vacation may in any case if the court or judge deem it proper dispense with such publication in a newspaper It will be seen from the above section that in any case in which the court or judge thereof in vacation dispenses with the publica tion of the order in a newspaper the only publication of the order that is required is the posting of the order of course a copy of it by the clerk at the front door of the courthouse It is further provided within what time after the publication of the order a case may be tried or heard by  3232 as amended Acts 1906 page 47 When such order shall have been so executed or when a copy of any process or notice beginning any action shall have been published as provided by any section of this chapter if the de fendants against whom it is entered or ptblished or the unknown parties shall not appear within fifteen days after the completion of the execution of the order or the expiration of the four weeks re quired for the completion of said publication the case may be tried or heard as to them  It will be seen that this section 3232 as amended embraces all cases under chapter 158 of the Code in which chapter is included  3525 and 3526which provide for service of process on nonresident corporations and trustees lessees and re ceivers thereof by publication of the process or notice once a week for four successive weeks in a newspaper published in this state But the question under consideration here is when under  323116 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER the publication of the order in a newspaper has been dispensed with As before stated the only publication required in such case is the posting of the order at the front door of the courthouse by the clerk on or before the rule day after it is entered Therefore when the order is thus posted it follows that by the posting of it at the front door of the courthouse as aforesaid the execution of the order is completed and that if the defendant against whom it is entered or the unknown parties shall not appear within fifteen days thereafter that is within fifteen days after the order is posted by the clerk the case may be tried or heard as to them The provision to dispense with the publication of an ord6r of pub lication in a newspaper was adopted at the revisal of 1887 and its purpose was to facilitate the proceedings against nonresidents in a proper case and prevent unnecessary delay And as to what is a proper case is left to the discretion of the court or the judge thereof in vacation Judge Burks who was one of the revisors said Un due delay in the administration of justice is always a just cause of complaint It occurred to the revisors that more time than was nec essary was given for maturing suits at rules in the clerks office for trial or hearing in court The shortest time in which a suit could be matured unless by consent was generally two months This was because two rule days were required for this purpose and the rules were generally monthly The law is changed so as to make the rules semimonthly and a case may therefore be now matured in one month or less time from the institution of the suit Burks Ad dress Bartons Law Practice 2nd ed page 1389 When the court or judge in vacation dispenses with the publication of an order of publication in a newspaper and the order has been posted at the front door of the courthouse by the clerk on or before the rule day after It is entered the execution of the order is completed the requirement of  3232 is complied with and the case is ready to be tried or heard in fifteen days thereafter In other words the effect of the dispens ing with the publication of the order in a newspaper is to enable a plaintiff to mature his suit against a nonresident defendant or unknown party within the same time that he can mature it against a home defendant by personal service of process thus putting the non resident and inklnown parties upon the same footing as to time as the home defendant JAMES T GUTHRIE Lynchlburg Va December 16 1910 This interpretation of the statute may no doubt be correct and might prevail provided the court or judge exercised his discretion wisely in dispensing with such publication And possibly such length of notice would be held sufficient as to nonresident defendants in contiguous states But beyond that there would be serious danger 716 Jan1911 MISCELLANY 717 of infringing the due process clause of the Federal constitution For example it was held in Roller v Holly 176 U S 398 that where serv ice of process was made upon a defendant residing in Virginia re quiring him to appear and answer a suit in Texas within five days it is held that such notice was not a reasonable one was not due proc ess of law within the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and that a judgment obtained upon such notice was not binding upon the defendant In this case Mr Justice Brown delivering the opinion of the United States Supreme Court said That a man is entitled to some notice before he can be deprived of his liberty or property is an axiom of the law to which no citation of authority would give additional weight but upon the question of the length of such notice there is a singular dearth of judicial de cision It is manifest that the requirement of notice would be of no value whatever unless such notice were reasonable and adequate for the purpose What shall be deemed a reasonable notice admits of considerable doubt    It may be said in general with reference to these statutes that is the statutes of the various states which the court sets out in its opinion that in cases of publication notice is re quired to be given at least once a week for from four to eight weeks and in case of personal service out of the state no notice for less than twenty days between the service and return day is contemplated in any of the states except Mississippi where a personal notice of ten days seems to be sufficient MISCELLANY The Decline in Trial by JuryIt seems that the steady decline in the trial of civil causes by jury in the state which was pointed out in our leading article last month is also taking place in England The London Law Journal asks Why is it that as the business of the County Courts grows the number of cases tried by juries decreases Only 725 of the 897042 actions tried in 1909 were tried by juries This 101 less than in the preceding year is the lowest number on record Some years back when the number of actions determined was less than 500000 the actions tried by juries numbered more than 1000 On four circuits the Newcastle Leeds Oswestry and Bristol circuitsnot a single action was tried with a jury during the whole of last year On fif teen other circuits including some of the most important towns in the country the number of jury actions was less than five Some judges it may be do not conceal their objection to trial by jury and suitors and their advisers of course deem it imprudent to disregard the objection The more probable reason for the decline in trial by

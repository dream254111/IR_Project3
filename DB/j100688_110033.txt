is added a Description of the Bones Abstracr,i207044,186 height of this station he determined by levelling to the Grand Junc tion Canal from which and the known difference of levels of the canals communicating with this he obtained the relative height of this station compared with the most important objects in North ampton Buckingham and Bedford Finding the country to the north of Arbury station suddenly fall about 400 feet and continue thus depressed for nine or ten miles Mr Bevan observes that such a defect of matter would probably produce a deflection of the plumb line to the southward and accordingly on calculating the latitude of Arbury station from that of Blenheim observatory independent of any astronomical observations made at Arbury he found it 5 less than shown by the zenith sector giving countenance to the proba bility of local attraction by the high land to the south of the station The author thinks that the observations at Dunnose were affected by the high land to the north of that station giving a latitude less than it should be by 711 or 8 and that Greenwich observatory is not altogether clear of local attraction from the higher land to the south and defect upon the northern side Clifton station also he remarks may be 2 or 3f in error from the same cause With such corrections as the face of the country may warrant not exceeding in the whole 200 miles above 10 the author thinks it probable that the section of the meridian measured in Britain may agree with the different sections measured in other parts of the world Mr Bevan lastly adverts to the probable errors in the height of the stations in the survey and assuming the highest points of the Grand Junction Canal to be 408 feet above the level of the sea at low water spring tides he considers the heights of Wendover Kens worth Bowbrick Hill and Arbury Hill stations to be about 72 feet in excess as laid down in the survey On some Fossil Bones discovered in Caverns in the Limestone Quarries of Oreston By Joseph Whidbey Esq FRS In a Letter ad dressed to John Barrow Esq FRS To which is added a De scription of the Bones by Mr William Clift Conservator of the Museum of the College of Surgeons Read February 6 1823 Phil Trans 1823 p 78 In one of these caverns there was a lining of stalactite and the bones were lying loosely covered with rubble in another the bones adhered to the walls To this letter is annexed a description of the bones found by Mr Whidbey by Mr Clift Conservator of the Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons They belong to animals of several distinct genera namely the Bos the Deer Hyaena Horse Wolf and Fox Of these bones a few are superficially incrusted with stalagmite but the greater number were firmly imbedded in stiff clay and exhibit no appearances of187 mutilation except in one instance where the radius of a young wolf is impressed by the incisors and canine teeth of an animal the size of the weasel Such of the bones as were examined appeared to have lost the greater part of their animal matter and had consequently become brittle some of them when immersed in water became black but recovered their former appearance on drying this was especially the case with those of the carnivorous tribes Mr Clift observes that appearances of disease in fossil bones are of rare occurrence among these however he found two examples in the metacarpal and metatarsal bones of the bovine animals show ing upon their surface the effect of ossific inflammation there were also marks of disease in the lower jaw of a young wolf It appears from Mr Clifts detailed enumeration of the bones from these caverns that they are clearly referable to animals of known and still existing genera but he observes that it is a curious cir cumstance that with the exception of the very few belonging to the deer they all appertain to animals differing from those formerly found in the immediate vicinity of the present caverns Mr Clift concludes this communication with a particular descrip tion and enumeration of the bones which are further illustrated by reference to several drawings On the Chinese Year By J F Davis Esq FRS Read December 19 1822 Phil Trans 1823 p 91 After stating his opinion that the Chinese are possessed of no original astronomical knowledge but that that which they possess is entirely of foreign origin since in former times they even adopted the errors of European astronomers and that the instruments men tioned by Du Halde as having been found by the missionaries on their first entrance into the country were constructed by the Ara bians the author proceeds to confirm this opinion by an account of the division of the Chinese year and a comparison of the Chinese with the European zodiac The former is divided into twentyeight constellations and Mr Davis has represented these in an annexed drawing with the number of degrees affixed to each from which it appears that they are extremely unequal the largest consisting of 30 and the least of not more than 5 Of these constellations Kio which corresponds to a part of Virgo is considered as the first in order which is perhaps a proof says the author that in some former period their year commenced at this point As far however as Mr Daviss information the Chinese have no solar year their year properly considered being a lunar year consisting of twelve months of twentynine and thirty days alternately with the occa sional addition of a thirteenth month to make it correspond more nearlv with the suns course

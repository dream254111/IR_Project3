WESTHILLS BALTIMORE THE UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA NORFOLK CINCINNATI AND IVASHVILLE REPORTED MARCH 6TH 1835 THE COMMITTEE APPOINTED TO MAKE A COLLECTION OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE RECENT SOLAR ECLIPSE RESPECTFULLY REPORT THE FOLLOWING FOR PUBLICA TION IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY ALEX DALLAS BACHE JOS ROBERTS JUN ISAIAH LUKENS MEMORANDUM OF OBSERVATIONS OF THE SOLAR ECLIPSE OF JNOVEMBER 30TH 1834 MADE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA BY EDWARD H COURTENAY PROFESSOR OF MATHEMATICS IN THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA DURING ONE OR TWO HOURS IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING THE COMMENCEMENT OF THE ECLIPSE THE SUN WAS FREQUENTLY OBSCURED BY CLOUDS BUT THESE ALTHOUGH NOT ENTIRELY DISPERSED HAD DISAPPEARED SUFFICIENTLY TO PERMIT A VERY SATISFACTORY OBSERVATION OF THE COMMENCEMENT FOR SEVERAL SECONDS SAY FIVE OR SIX PREVIOUS TO THE FIRST DISTINCT IMPRESSION ON THE SUNS DISK A SLIGHT TREMULOUS MOTION WAS DISTINCTLY OBSERVED NEAR THAT VOL V3 I234 COLLECTION OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE POINT OF THE LIMB AT WHICH THE ECLIPSE WAS EXPECTED TO COMMENCE THIS SERVED AS ANI ADDITIONAL GUIDE TO THE EYE WHICH WAS ACCORDINGLY FOUND TO BE DIRECTED VERY ACCURATELY TO THE POINT AT WHICH THE INDELNTA TION FIRST OCCUIRRED THE LIMB OF THE SUN AT THIS TIME WAS BEAUTIFULLY DEFINED SOON AFTER THE COMMENCEMENT THE CLOUDS BEGAN AGAIN TO ACCU MULATE AND AT THE PERIOD OF GREATEST OBSCURATION THE SUN WAS ENTIRELY CONCEALED ABOUT TWENTY MINUTES BEFORE THE END THE CLOUDS HAD AGAIN DISPERSED LEAVING THE SUN MUCH BRIGHTER THAN AT ANY PREVIOUS PERIOD DURING THE ECLIPSE AND GIVING PROMISE OF A HIGHLY SATISFACTORY OBSERVA TION OF THE END BUT AT FIFTEEN OR TWENTY SECONDS BEFORE THE FINIAL SEPA RATION OF THE DISKS A LIGHT FLEECY CLOUD PASSED BEFORE THEM ALTERNATELY CONCEALING THE SIUN AND PERMITTING HIM TO BE SEEN THE EFFECT OF THIS WAS TO DAZZLE THE EYE AND TO RENDER THE VISION SO FAR IMNPERFECT THAT THE INSTANT OF SEPARATION OF THE DISKS COULD NIOT BE FIXED AS SATISFACTORILY AS THAT OF THE COMMENCEMENT THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE WITH A SIXTY INELH REFRACTOR BY DOLLOND BELOUGING TO THE UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA THE DIAMETER OF THE OBJECT GLASS BEING THREE AND THREEFOURTHS INCHES THE TIME KEEPER WAS A CHRONOMETER OF EXCELLENT CHARACTER BY PARKIN SON AND FRODSHAMN AND ITS ERROR AND RATE WERE ASCERTAINIED BY FREQUENT TRANSITS OF THE SUN AND STARS ON THE DAY OF THE ECLIPSE AND FOR SEVERAL DAYS PREVIOUS THE LIMBS OF THE SUN AND MOON WHEN NOT OBSCURED BY CLOUDS WERE DEFINED AS DISTINCTLY AS COULD HAVE BEEN DESIRED THE COLOUR OF THE SUNS DISK AS SEEN THROUGH THE DARK GLASS USED

respectfully report the following for publica tion in the Transactions of the Society ALEX DALLAS BACHE Jos ROBERTS JUN ISAIAH LUKENS Memorandum of Observations of the Solar Eclipse of JNovember 30th 1834 made at the University of Pennsylvania By Edward H Courtenay Professor of Mathematics in the University of Pennsylvania During one or two hours immediately preceding the commencement of the eclipse the sun was frequently obscured by clouds but these although not entirely dispersed had disappeared sufficiently to permit a very satisfactory observation of the commencement For several seconds say five or six previous to the first distinct impression on the suns disk a slight tremulous motion was distinctly observed near that VOL V3 I234 COLLECTION OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE point of the limb at which the eclipse was expected to commence This served as ani additional guide to the eye which was accordingly found to be directed very accurately to the point at which the indelnta tion first occuirred The limb of the sun at this time was beautifully defined soon after the commencement the clouds began again to accu mulate and at the period of greatest obscuration the sun was entirely concealed About twenty minutes before the end the clouds had again dispersed leaving the sun much brighter than at any previous period during the eclipse and giving promise of a highly satisfactory observa tion of the end but at fifteen or twenty seconds before the finial sepa ration of the disks a light fleecy cloud passed before them alternately concealing the siun and permitting him to be seen The effect of this was to dazzle the eye and to render the vision so far imnperfect that the instant of separation of the disks could niot be fixed as satisfactorily as that of the commencement The observations were made with a sixty inelh refractor by Dollond belouging to the University of Pennsylvania the diameter of the object glass being three and threefourths inches The time keeper was a chronometer of excellent character by Parkin son and Frodshamn and its error and rate were ascertainied by frequent transits of the sun and stars on the day of the eclipse and for several days previous The limbs of the sun and moon when not obscured by clouds were defined as distinctly as could have been desired The colour of the suns disk as seen through the dark glass used was a bright orange extremely agreeable to the eye that of the moon ill tensely black The times observed reduced to the meridian of Independence Hall were as follows h m sec Commencemeint 1 00 105 End

Sun November 30th 1834 made at Friends Observatory Fourth Street Philadelphia By Joseph Roberts Jun The morning was clear and without clouds till about eleven oclock when the eastern western and southern sky became overcast with thin white clouds moving from the west At noon determined the state of the clock by the fixed transit instrumenit The beginning of the eclipse observed with an achromatic telescope with a power of about 38 happened at 1 h 0 m 1585 sec mean civil time corrected for the rate of the clock deternmined by transits both before and after the eclipse The observation of the beginning was very good but from a few minutes after the beginning till some time after the end of the eclipse there was a constant succession of clouds between the sun and the observer often so dense as to render the sun invisible at the time of the greatest obscuration the sun was visible through thin clouds Determined the magnitude of the eclipse when comnpared with a mea sure of the sluns diameter taken with a Troughton micrometer near nooni of the same day The obscured part measured 10755 digits which differs from the calcuilation about a three hundredth part of a digit or five seconds This observation was made under unfavourable circumstances The end of the eclipse happened at 3 h 37 m 45 sec mean time corrected A haze about the sun may have caused the disappearance of the moon a few seconds before the actual end of the eclipse in which case the latter number should be increased a few seconds Observations on the Solar Eclipse of NAovember 30th 1834 made at Philadelphia

NJatural Philosophy and Chemistry in the Untiversity of Pennsylvania The day of the eclipse was one of a series of days above the ordinary temperature of the season a thermometer which on Tlhursday the 4th of December stood in the shade at 2 PM at 352 Fahrenheit stood in the same place on November 298th at 51 at the same time on the 29th at 480 on the 1st of December at 51 on the 2d at 470 and on the day of the eclipse at 451O During the eclipse tlle thermometer in the shade fell from 490 at 1 oclock to 43O at 2 h 22 in the tem perature being obtained by swinging the thermometer On the fol lowing day whiclh was cloudy the clouds being however less denise thani on the 30th the thermometer rose during the same time 29o and on the 28th at which time there were fewer clouds 24 The VOL v3 K238 COLLECTION OF OBSERVATIONS ON THE effect of the clouds in preventing the rise of the thermometer being taken at X of a degree gives in addition to a rise of 2 prevented a depression of 50 produced making 7 for the effect on the air In the eclipse of 1831 the observed effect on the temperature of the air not taking inlto account the rise which would in other circumstances have been produced was 40 Fahrenheit which was however much more felt than the present the fall being from 352 Fahrenheit to 30g A thermomneter with the bulb blackenied by writing ink and con fined in a plate glass case fell from 1010 at which it stood at 1 PM to 460 at 2 h 30 mn which was the lowest point that it attained the depression amounting to 550 in one hour anld a half from the effect of the clouds and of the eclipse In the eclipse of 1831 the depression of a similar instrument not protected from the air was 360 The variable effect of the temperature of the air renders such comparisons very vague The time of greatest obscuration from clouds coincided nearly with that from the eclipse and the varying density of the clouds rendered the photometer of no service and disappointed me in observations which had been arranged for that instrutmernt The photometer which in 1831 exhibited at the time of greatest obscuration a quantity of light from the direct action of the sun amounting to 40 in 565 or 14 gave but 2 for the same quantity on the presenit occasion This remark applies only to the direct light for that which was reflected was greater than in 1831 The dew point which at 7 AM was at 280 fell on the formation of clouds and was at l h 40 m 240 and at 2 h 40 m 2310O A series of magnetic observations on the dip intensity and variation were made and the results will at a future date be communicated They may have an important bearinig on the theory of the diurnal variationSOLAR ECLIPSE OF NOVEMBER 30 1834 239 Observations of the times of beginning and end of the Eclipse of

of the clock were determined by a number of observations of the suns meridian passage including one on the day of the eclipse the state of the transit instrument a twenty inch one by Dollond being

pieces but was not accompanied by a statement of their powers and I have not yet had leisure to ascertain them The lowest wgas used it is probably about forty At the time of commencement part of a small cloud too dense to admit of distinct vision through it obscured the sun for a few seconds in consequence of which the time of beginning as given above may be in error to the amount of three or four seconds The observation of the end was free from obstruc tion and is I think accurate The latitude of our place may be regarded as a near approximation I lhave not yet made a sufficient numnber

Mr Hasslers principle but as one of the sets was interrupted by the tremor of the mercury from the motion of some of the spec tators the series was rendered imperfect and could not therefore be used

Parkinson and Frodsham whose rate has for some time back been 05 slow and the local mean time was ascertained by sets of altitudes of the sun accurately observed on the forenoons immediately preceding and succeeding the eclipse The contacts were observed by a Dollonds achromatic telescope with a power of eightyfive assisted by a lesser one of about thirty The two observations agreed so nearly as

first limb was observed before and after reversing To correct if necessary any inequality in the rate of the pocket chronometer in the correctness of which I had little confidence as it was habitually used as a pocket watch I conmpared it about every hour with the clock which was set going for the occasion The rate of the clock could be depended upon for uniformity but what that was was unkinown as

sines of the unobscured part of the suls disk The difficulty of measuring these accurately was much greater than of measuring the chords in those the perpendicular hair could be made to coincide with the angles of the disk and there was no doubt of the measured line being perpen dicular to the parallel lines of the micrometer In measuring the versed sines the eye alone could decide except so far as it could be aided by first bringing the perpendicular line to coincide with the angular points and then moving the telescope in azimuth to bring the parallel wires on the conicave and convex parts of the crescent but this line changed its angle with the horizon so rapidly that little assist ance could be derived from this practice Time by Chronometer Div of Micrometer h1 m sec 1 17 40 2915 21

Professor of JVcaturcal Philosophy in the NJashville University The day was unusually pleasant and as not a cloud was visible the opportunities of observation were very favourable The situation of observation was at the University buildings about three quarters of a mile east of south from the public square of Nashville in latitude 360 9 3266 as is believed from many very careful trials and in longitude about 5 h 47 in 16 sec west The latitude of the square as determined by circumpolar stars is about 360 10 7 The local time was obtained by equal altitudes of the suii taken by a superior sextant previously adjusted with much care The time of the suns passage through the wires of a tranisit instrument not adjusted how ever precisely to the meridian but of which the deviation had pre viously been ascertained was also noted to obtain the error of the chronometer The result differed from the former but onetenth of a second Unfortunately in ascertaining the error of the chronometer

so long as such custodian exists The death of the parent who is custodian cuts off any rights held and confers the right of custody to the surviving parent This right of the surviving parent cannot be overcome by any action on the part of the deceased such as giving the custody by will or contract In re Neff supra In re Blackburn 41 Mo App 622 MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONTS  NDEPNDENT CONTRACTORS  MASIER AND SERVANTA city entered into a written agreement with a person to haul away the city garbage The terms of the contractspecified the number of men the hours of labor the wages to be paid etc It fur ther provided that the work was to be done in compliance with the city ordinances relating to the matter and under the supervision of the city health commissioner The city reserved the right to cancel the con tract upon ten days notice if it was not performed according to its conditions The plaintiffs intestate was killed by one of the teams employed in hauling the garbage An action was brought against the city for damages It was defended on the ground that the person haul ing was an independent contractor Held the city is not liable Moun tain v City of Fargo N D 166 N W 416 The difficulty in cases of this sort is encountered in determining from the contract between the contractor and the municipal corporation whether their relation is that of independent contractor and employer or of master and servant The test is the right reserved by the em ployer to control the work of the employee Uppington v New York 165 N Y 222 53 L R A 550 Powell v Virginia Const Co 88 Tenn 692 17 Am St Rep 925 Actual exercise of control or interference by the employer is unnecessary it is the right to interfere which makes the difference between an independent contractor and a servant or agent Norwalk Gas Light Co v Norwalk 63 Conn 495 28 AtL 32 Knicely v W Va Midland R Co 64 W Va 278 17 L R A N S 370 But a fundamental distinction must be noted between the right to con trol the method and means of the work and the right to control the re sult The employee must have the right to control the means and methods of the work in order to be an independent contractor Bibbs v N  W1 R Co 87 Va 711 14 S E 163 Thus agreements that the work of the contractor must be approved by or acceptable to the em ployer or that it must be done to the employers satisfaction or that the employer has the right to inspect direct or supervise the work since they affect the result only the means and method of perform ance being left to the contractor do not make the relation that of mas ter and servant Julius Keller Const Co v Herkless Ind 109 N E 797 Larsen v Home Tel Co 164 Mich 205 129 N WV 894 So where a contractor blasted rocks under an agreement with the defendant city which stated that the city engineer should have the right to direct that the work should be continued under such conditions as he might pre scribe he was held an independent contractor Salmnon v Kansas City 241 Mo 14 145 S W 16 39 L R A N S 328 In a similar agree ment under which the contractor was required to work under the imVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW mediate supervision and direction of the city engineer he was also held an independent contractor Norwalk Gas Light Co v Norwalk supra Foster v City of Chicago 197 Ill 264 64 N E 322 It is difficult to reconcile these cases with the decision that a contractor who un der a contract with a city was to improve the streets the work to be done under the direction of the city commissioner was a mere serv ant of the city City of St Paul v Seitz 3 Minn 297 74 Am Dec 753 So a contractor has been held to be a servant when his agreement pro vided that an engineer of the employer should supervise and direct the work to be done and that it should be done to his satisfaction New Orleans etc v Hanling 15 Wall 649 And where a contractor agrees to perform all the work under the immediate supervision and direction of the commissioner of public work of a city and to his entire ap proval satisfaction and acceptance he is held to be a servant of the city City of Chicago v Murdock 212 Ill 9 72 N E 46 103 Am St Rep 221 In the latter case however the decision seems to have been based on the ground that the work being done was inherently danger ous and for that reason the city was liable The apparent confusion in the cases is due to the difficulties experi enced in determining when the power of the employer in controlling the result of the work is of sufficient extent to affect the means The employee to be an independent contractor must have the right to control the method and means of performance The modern tendency of the cases is in this direction And in general the rule may be stated that where a reasonable construction of the contract shows a right in the city to control the means and methods of performing the contract the city will be held liable for the contractors act PARENT AND CHILDEMANCIPATIONCLAIMS OF CREDITORSA mother allowed her minor daughter to work and earn money on her own ac count The parent then conveyed property to the child upon the con sideration of lifetime support by the child The conveyance was attacked by creditors of the mother on the ground that the minors ser vices were owed to the parent and could not therefore constitute a con sideration for the transfer The defense was that the child was emancipated and hence the contract for the support was a valid considera tion Held the child is emancipated and the transfer is valid Merithew v Ellis Me 102 Atl 301 The rule is generally stated that a father can expressly emancipate his minor child Bristow v Chicago etc R Co 128 Ia 479 104 N W 487 Emancipation may also result through implication as where the father assents to the childs earning money from third persons and to the childs investment of the money Jacobs v Jacobs 130 Ia 10 104 N W 489 So also where the son remained away from the parental roof earning and spending his salary he was emancipated Holland v Hart ley 171 N C 376 88 S E 507 Where the father contracted to pay the minor for services rendered to the father he has thereby impliedly emancipated the child Wilson v McMillan 62 Ga 16 35 Am Rep 115 But where the child lives with his parents paying board to them his emancipation is not absolute even though he keeps his own earnings 510

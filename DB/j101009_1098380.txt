CONTROVERSY IN THIS APPEAL IS WHETHER W L OLIVIER AND TWENTY FIVE OTHER PARTIES WHO FILED THEIR PETITION IN THIS CAUSE ARE LIABLE TO THE CREDITORS OF THE WESLEYAN FEMALE INSTITUTE AN INSOLVENT CORPORATION ON CERTAIN NOTES MADE BY THEM AND NOW IN THE HANDS OF REEVES CATT THE RECEIVER OF THE COURT IN THIS CASE THIS QUESTION WAS REFERRED TO ONE OF THE COMMISSIONERS OF THE COURT FOR INVESTIGATION HE REPORTED THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH THE NOTES WERE MADE AND REACHED THE CONCLUSION THAT THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES WERE NOT LIABLE THEREON THE COURT CONFIRMED HIS REPORT AND FROM THAT DECREE THIS APPEAL WAS ALLOWED IT APPEARS FROM THE COMMISSIONERS REPORT WHICH IN ALL MATERIAL MATTERS IS WE THINK SUSTAINED BY THE EVIDENCE THAT IN THE YEAR 1893 THE FRIENDS OF THE INSTITUTE FINDING THAT IT WAS FINANCIALLY EMBARASSED SET ABOUT TO DEVISE MEANS TO MEET ITS INDEBTEDNESS AND TO CONTINUE THE SCHOOL AS A GOING CONCERN THAT THE HEAD OF THE MOVEMENT WAS ONE W W SMITH AN ACTIVE WORKER IN THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH SOUTH THAT HE AND PARTIES INTERESTED HELD A PUBLIC MEETING AT THE YOUNG MENS CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION BUILDING IN STAUNTON FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADOPTING SOME MEANS TO ACCOMPLISH THAT END THAT THE PLAN PROPOSED AND ADOPTED WAS THAT SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE AMOUNT OF 25000 SHOULD BE SECURED OF WHICH SUM 10000 WAS TO BE RAISED IN AND ABOUT STAUNTON BY THE FRIENDS OF THE INSTITUTE WHILST THE REMAINING SUM OF 15000 WAS TO BE SECURED BY THE FRIENDS OF THE SCHOOL AT LARGE THAT THIS FUND WAS TO BE KEPT AS A SEPARATE ONE AND WHEN SECURED WAS TO BE USED TO PAY OFF THE BONDED INDEBTEDNESS OF THE SCHOOL AFTER WHICH ANY SURPLUS THAT MIGHT REMAIN WAS TO BE USED FOR ITS GENERAL BENEFIT THAT IT WAS FURTHER UNDERSTOOD THAT NONE OF THE SUBSCRIPTIONS SECURED WERE TO BE BINDING UNLESS THE ENTIRE SUM OF 25000 WAS SECURED AND THAT THIS SUM WHEN SECURED WAS TO BE TURNED OVER TO THE INSTITUTE FOR THE PURPOSE NAMED AND NONE OTHER THAT WHEN THIS WAS DONE IT WAS TO GIVE SUCH SUBSCRIBERS A DEED OF TRUST ON ITS REAL ESTATE BY WHICH IT WAS TO BIND ITSELF TO RETURN TO THEM WITHOUT INTEREST THE AMOUNT OF THEIR SEVERAL SUBSCRIP TIONS IN THE EVENT IT SHOULD CEASE TO BE CONDUCTED AS A CONFERENCE SCHOOL IN STAUNTON THAT THE NEXT STEP TAKEN WAS AT A MEETING OF SOME OF THE SUBSCRIBERS TO THE FUND HELD AT THE VIRGINIA HOTEL IN STAUNTON AT WHICH IT WAS AGREED THAT J A FAUVER SHOULD ACT AS TRUSTEE TO HOLD THE FUND FOR THE PURPOSE NAMED AND THAT HE AND ONE GEORGE S LIGHTNER SHOULD REDUCE TO WRITING THE CONDITIONS ABOVE STATED UPON WHICH SUBSCRIPTIONS HAD BEEN OR WERE TO BE RECEIVED THAT THIS WRITING 466 NOVWAS NEVER PREPARED THAT THERE WAS NO SUBSCRIPTION PAPER AND THAT THE PROMISES TO PAY WERE EMBODIED IN THE NOTES GIVEN BY THE SUB SCRIBERS WHICH WERE ALL EXECUTED AFTER THE LAST NAMED MEETING THAT THE SUBSCRIPTION NOTES WERE OBTAINED BY DIFFERENT SOLICITORS JUST WHO THOSE SOLICITORS WERE IS NOT SHOWN BUT MANY OF THEM WERE TAKEN BY W W ROBERTSON PRESIDENT OF THE SCHOOL BUT NOT A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CORPORATION THAT SOME TIME AFTER THE NOTES WERE MADE J A FAUVER TREASURER TO WHOM THEY WERE ALL PAY ABLE MADE THE FOLLBWING ENDORSEMENT UPON EACH OF THEM J A FAUVER TREASURER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEE OF THE WESLEYAN FEMALE INSTITUTE STAUNTON VA AND LEFT THEM WITH MR ROBERTSON AT WHOSE INSTANCE THE ENDORSEMENTS WERE MADE AND IN WHOSE POSSESSION THE NOTES SEEM TO HAVE BEEN FROM THE TIME THEY WERE EXECUTED UNTIL THE CORPORATION MADE AN ASSIGNMENT OF ALL ITS PROPERTY TO REEVES CATT TRUSTEE IT FURTHER APPEARS THAT ROBERTSON PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTION FAUVER THE PAYEE IN THE NOTES CATT TRUSTEE NOW RECEIVER AND SOME IF NOT ALL OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE IN STITUTE KNEW THE PURPOSES FOR AND THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THE NOTES WERE MADE IT FURTHERS APPEARS THAT NONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THE NOTES WERE GIVEN WERE OR CAN BE PERFORMED BY THE INSTITUTE ONE OF THE GROUNDS UPON WHICH THE CREDITORS OF THE INSTITUTE INSIST THAT THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES ARE LIABLE THEREON IS THAT THE NOTES FORMED A LARGE AND MATERIAL PART OF THE ASSETS OF THE CORPORATION AND WERE USED BY IT WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE AND CONSENT OF THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES AS A BASIS OF CREDIT AND THAT AS THEY THE CREDITORS RELIED LARGELY UPON THE NOTES AS A VALID ASSET OF THE CORPORATION IN EXTENDING SUCH CREDIT IT WOULD BE INEQUITABLE AND ILLEGAL NOT TO HOLD THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES LIABLE WHATEVER MERIT THERE MIGHT BE IN THIS CONTENTION IF TRUE IT IS UN NECESSARY TO CONSIDER AS THE EVIDENCE DOES NOT SHOW THAT THE CREDITORS THE APPELLANTS HERE RELIED UPON THESE NOTES IN EXTENDING CREDIT TO THE CORPORATION OR EVEN KNEW OF THEIR EXISTENCE UNTIL AFTER THEIR DEBTS WERE CREATED AND THE ASSIGNMENT MADE TO CATT TRUSTEE IT IS INSISTED THAT THE NOTES BEING PLAIN UNCONDITIONAL AND UNAM BIGUOUS PROMISES TO PAY MONEY CANNOT BE VARIED ALTERED OR CONTRADICTED BY ANY VERBAL EVIDENCE OF A PRIOR OR CONTEMPORANEOUS AGREEMENT BE TWEEN THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES AND THE CORPORATION NO RULE OF LAW IS BETTER SETTLED OR OF GREATER IMPORTANCE THAN THAT 1900 467 CATT V OLIVIER6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER A WRITTEN CONTRACT CANNOT BE CONTRADICTED OR VARIED BY EVIDENCE OF AN ORAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES MADE BEFORE OR AT THE TIME OF SUCH CONTRACT THE OBJECT OF THE EVIDENCE INTRODUCED IN THIS CASE WAS NOT HOWEVER FOR THE PURPOSE OF CONTRADICTING OR VARYING THE WRITINGS IN QUESTION BUT TO SHOW THAT THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THEY WERE TO BECOME OPERATIVE NEVER OCCURRED THAT THIS MAY BE DONE WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITATIONS BY ORAL EVIDENCE IS ALSO WELL SETTLED IN SUCH CASES AS WAS SAID BY THIS COURT IN NASH V FUGATE 32 GRATT 595 609 THE ORAL EVIDENCE TENDS TO PROVE INDEPENDENT FACTS WHICH IF ESTABLISHED AVOIDS THE EFFECT OF THE WRITTEN AGREEMENT BY FACTS DE HORS THE INSTRUMENT BUT DO NOT TEND TO CONTRADICT OR VARY IT   AND IN WOODWARD BALDWIN  CO V FOSTER 18 GRATT 200 207 JUDGE JOYNES IN DISCUSSING THE SAME SUBJECT SAYS SO IT HAS BEEN HELD THAT BETWEEN THE IMMEDIATE PARTIES EVIDENCE MAY BE GIVEN OF A COTEMPORANEOUS AGREEMENT CONSISTENT WITH TLH WRITTEN CONTRACT AS FOR EXAMPLE THAT THE BILL WAS ENDORSED AND HANDED OVER FOR A PARTICU LAR PURPOSE AS FOR COLLECTION WITHOUT GIVING THE TRUSTEE THE USUAL RIGHTS OF AN ENDORSEEMANLEY V BOYCOT 75 ENG C L R 45OR THAT THE BILL WAS TRANSFERRED AS AN ESCROW OR UPON AN EXPRESS CONDITION WHICH HAS NOT BEEN COMPLIED WITH IN WARD V CHURN 18 GRATT 801 813 IT WAS SAID THAT WHEN THE INSTRUMENT IS DELIVERED DIRECTLY TO THE OBLIGEE THE DELIVERY CANNOT BE REGARDED AS CONDITIONAL IN RESPECT TO THE PARTY WHO MAKES IT UNLESS THE CONDITION IS MADE KNOWN TO THE OBLIGEE  IF THE DELIVERY IS UPON A CONDITION MADE KNOWN TO THE OBLIGEE HIS ASSENT TO IT WILL BE PRESUMED FROM THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE INSTRUMENT AND HE WILL NOT BE ALLOWED TO REPUDIATE THE CONDITION THUS ASSERTED AND TREAT THE DELIVERY AS ABSOLUTE AND UNCONDITIONAL SEE ALSO SOLENBERGER V GILBERT 86 VA778 HUMPHREYS V RICHMOND  JI R R 88 VA 431 THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES HELD IN THE CASE OF BURKE V DULANEY 153 U S 228 THAT IN AN ACTION BY THE PAYEE OF A NE GOTIABLE NOTE AGAINST THE MAKER EVIDENCE WAS ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW BY PAROL AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES MADE AT THE TIME OF MAKING THE NOTE THAT IT SHOULD NOT BECOME OPERATIVE AS A NOTE UNTIL THE MAKER COULD EXAMINE THE PROPERTY FOR WHICH IT WAS TO BE GIVEN AND DETERMINE WHETHER HE WOULD PURCHASE IT THE CONTROVERSY IN THIS CASE IS REALLY BETWEEN THE SAME PARTIES FOR THE RECEIVER AND THE CREDITORS IN THE CASE TOOK NO OTHER OR GREATER INTEREST IN THE NOTES THAN THE INSTITUTE HAD THE EVIDENCE WAS NOT 468 NOVONLY ADMISSIBLE TO SHOW BUT IT DOES SHOW WE THINK THAT THE NOTES WERE MADE UPON CONDITIONS WHICH WERE NEVER COMPLIED WITH SOME OF WHICH AT LEAST IF NOT ALL WERE KNOWN TO AND RECOGNIZED BY THE CORPORATION IT IS ALSO CONTENDED THAT THE RECORD DOES NOT SHOW EXCEPT AS TO A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF THE MAKERS OF THE SUBSCRIPTION NOTES THAT THEY KNEW OF OR MADE THEIR SUBSCRIPTIONS UPON THE CONDITIONS NAMED WHILST ONLY THREE OF THE SUBSCRIBERS TO THE FUND FOR WHICH THE NOTES WERE GIVEN TESTIFY IN THE CASE THEY PROVE CLEARLY THAT THE PLAN PRO POSED AND ADOPTED FOR RAISING THE MONEY WAS UPON CONDITIONS WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN AND CANNOT BE COMPLIED WITH THE NOTES GIVEN EXCEPT IN TWO INSTANCES ARE OF THE SAME DATE MOST OF THEM PAYABLE AT THE SAME TIME ALIKE IN ALL OTHER RESPECTS EXCEPT AS TO AMOUNTS AND MAKERS AND THEY WERE KEPT TOGETHER AND TREATED BY ALL PARTIES AS BELONGING TO THE SAME FUND THE RECORD WE THINK SATISFACTORILY SHOWS THAT THE NOTES WERE GIVEN FOR THE PURPOSES AND UPON CONDITIONS OUTLINED WHEN THE PLAN FOR RAISING THE MONEY WAS PROPOSED AND ADOPTED NEITHER WERE THOSE CONDITIONS WAIVED AS IT IS CONTENDED BY THE SUBSEQUENT CONDUCT OF THE MAKERS IN MAKING PAYMENT ON THEIR NOTES BEFORE THE CONDITIONS WERE COMPLIED WITH THEY HAD THE RIGHT TO EXPECT THAT THE CONDITIONS WOULD BE COMPLIED WITH AND THAT THE MONEY PAID BY THEM WOULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSE THAN THAT FOR WHICH THEY AGREED TO PAY IT THAT THIS WAS THEIR EXPECTATION IS SHOWN BY THE FACT THAT WHEN ROBERTSON THE PRESIDENT OF THE INSTITUTE USED THE MONEY COLLECTED BY HIM ON THE NOTES TO PAY THE RUNNING EXPENSES OF THE SCHOOL THE ATTENTION OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WAS CALLED TO IT WHEN THEY RECOGNIZING THAT THE MONEY COULD NOT BE USED FOR ANY SUCH PURPOSE DIRECTED THAT THE NOTE OF THE CORPORATION FOR THE AMOUNT SO USED BE EXECUTED PAYABLE TO FAUVER THE SAME PERSON TO WHOM THE NOTES WERE PAYABLE UPON WHICH COLLECTIONS HAD BEEN MADE AND MISAPPROPRIATED BY ROBERTSON THERE IS NOT SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN THE CASE TO JUSTIFY THE COURT IN HOLDING THAT THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES HAD WAIVED THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THEIR NOTES WERE MADE AFTER FULL KNOWLEDGE THAT THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH THEY WERE MADE HAD NOT BEEN AND COULD NOT BE COMPLIED WITH WITHOUT DISCUSSING FURTHER THE OBJECTIONS URGED TO THE DECREE COM PLAINED OF WE ARE OF OPINION THAT UPON THE WHOLE CASE THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES WHO ARE PARTIES TO THIS SUIT ARE NOT LIABLE THEREON AND THAT THE HUSTINGS COURT DID NOT ERR IN SO DECREEING AND DIRECTING THEIR NOTES TO BE CANCELLED AND SURRENDERED TO THEM AFFIRMED 1900 469 CATT V OLIVIER6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER NOTE THE DECISION IN THIS CASE SEEMS TO REST ON SOUNDEST PRINCIPLES THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE DOCTRINE HERE ESTABLISHED THAT THE MAKER OF A NEGOTIABLE NOTE OR OTHER WRITTEN PROMISE MAY PLEAD IN DEFENSE AN UNPERFORMED PAROL CONDI TION UPON WHICH THE WRITTEN PROMISE WAS DELIVERED AND THE WELL SETTLED PRINCIPLE EXEMPLIFIED IN WOODARD V FOSTER 18 GRATT 200 THAT AN ENDORSER CANNOT SET UP A CONTEMPORANEOUS PAROL AGREEMENT THAT HE IS NOT TO BE HELD AS AN ENDORSER IS EX TREMELY CLOSE PROF BURKS EXPRESSES THE OPINION IN A NOTE TO CITIZENS NATIONAL BANK V WALTON 4 VA LAW REG 591 596 THAT THE CASE OF BURKE V DULANEY 153 U S 228 UPON WHICH THE PRINCIPAL CASE RESTS IS IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH WOODARD V FOSTER THE COURT IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE QUOTES FROM THE OPINION IN WOODARD V FOSTER BUT MAKES NO REFERENCE TO THE APPARENT CONFLICT OF PRINCIPLE THERE IS PROBABLY NO REAL CONFLICT IF THE MAKERS OF THE NOTES IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE HAD ENDEAVORED TO ESTABLISH A CONTEMPORANEOUS PAROL AGREEMENT ON THE PART OF THE PAYEE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE ON THE NOTES OR IF IN WOODARD V FOSTER THE ENDORSER HAD OFFERED EVIDENCE TO PROVE A PAROL AGREEMENT THAT THE INSTRUMENT WITH HIS ENDORSEMENT WAS DELIVERED ON A CONDITION UNPERFORMED THE TWO CASES WOULD BE IDENTICALSINCE EVERY DEFENSE AVAILABLE TO A MAKER AGAINST THE PAYEE IS EQUALLY AVAILABLE TO AN ENDORSER AGAINST HIS IMMEDIATE ENDORSEE WHEN A WRITTEN PROMISE BY ONE PARTY IS DELIVERED TO THE OTHERTHE LATTER ON HIS PART ORALLY STIPULATING THE TERMS UPON WHICH THE INSTRUMENT IS ACCEPTED NOT INCONSISTENT WITH THE WRITTEN PROMISETHE ADMISSION OF PAROL TESTIMONY TO ESTABLISH THESE TERMS DOES NOT INFRINGE THE RULE FORBIDDING THE INTRODUCTION OF PAROL TESTIMONY TO VARY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT THE PRINCIPAL CASE SEEMS CLEARER IF WE SUPPOSE THE NOTES TO HAVE BEEN DELIVERED TO THE PAYEE ON ORAL CONDITION THAT EACH MAKER SHOULD RECEIVE A SHARE OF STOCK IN THE CORPORATIONA SCHOLARSHIP OR INDEED ANY OTHER PROPERTY OR BENEFIT THIS CONDITION UNFULFILLED WOULD CLEARLY BE A DEFENSE EVERY NOTE EXECUTED FOR THE PURCHASE OF LANDS OR GOODS IS DELIVERED ON SOME EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONE G THAT THE PAYEE SHALL MAKE GOOD HIS WARRANTY OF TITLE OR QUALITY ETC TO TAKE A CONCRETE CASE IF A EXECUTES A NOTE TO B HE CANNOT SET UP A CONTEMPORANEOUS PAROL AGREEMENT THAT B WILL NOT HOLD HIM LIABLE ON THE NOTE HE MAY PROVE HOWEVER EITHER THAT THERE WAS NO CONSIDERA TION OR THAT THE NOTE WAS EXECUTED AS THE PURCHASE PRICE OF A CERTAIN HORSE SOLD WITH CERTAIN WARRANTIES AND THAT THERE WAS AN EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITION THAT THE NOTE WAS NOT TO BE PAID IN WHOLE OR IN PART ON BREACH OF THIS CONDITION THE PRINCIPLE WHICH GIVES THE MAKER HIS DEFENSE IN THE CASE LAST ILLUSTRATED IS GENERALLY TREATED NOT AS A DELIVERY OF THE NOTE ON CONDITION BUT AS A FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION PARTIAL OR TOTAL INDEED THE BREACH OF CONDITION UPON WHICH THE IN STRUMENT IS DELIVERED IS NOTHING ELSE THAN A FAILURE OF CONSIDERATION THE PAYEE HAVING FAILED TO PERFORM THE CONDITION AS PROMISEDOR IF THE PERFORMANCE DOES NOT REST WITH HIM THE CONDITION BEING UNFULFILLEDTHE CONSIDERATION FOR THE MAKERS PROMISE FAILS IN THE PRINCIPAL CASE THEREFORE INSTEAD OF RESTING THE DECISION ON THE PRINCIPLE OF CONDITIONAL DELIVERY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLACED ON THE GROUND OF FAILURE OF CON SIDERATION THE GROUND UPON WHICH THE COURT PLACED IT HOWEVER IS THE ACCEPTED CLASSIFICATION 470 NOV

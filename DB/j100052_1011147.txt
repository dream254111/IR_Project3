LIABILITY AND COMPENSATION BY LEE K FRANKEL PHD Metropolitan Life Insurance Company New York It would be idle at this late date to attempt to present in detail the facts in connection with European legislation concerning accident liability and workmens compensation The United States Govern ment in various reports has presented in full the laws in various foreign countries dealing with these important topics Textbooks and magazine articles which have appeared from time to time amply cover the subject and give fully the basic information necessary for the comprehensive understanding of the attitude in Europe All that can be attempted at this time is a presentation of the philosophy of the movement in Europe which has been going on for over twentyfive years and which even today is in an embryonic state in several countries In fact a study of the laws themselves would be apt to lead the student astray One might be apt to con clude that there is no consensus of opinion regarding the final development of legislatior and that some of the chaos existing in the United States is still to be found across the ocean This however is not the case A clear conception of what Europe stands for in the matter of legislation regarding accident liability and workmens compensation is to be gathered from the proceedings of the various International Congresses on Social In surance which have been held during the last twentyfive years In fact the change of name in this organization indicates to some extent the general trend of legislation and of the wishes and desires of those who are sponsors for it Originally the congress was called the International Congress on Work Accidents Today the term International Congress on Social Insurance more aptly expresses the purposes and aims for which the congress stands In substance the underlying principles of legislation as exem plified in Germany and to lesser extent in other countries assume that the American doctrine of liability is false While this doctrine 241The Annals of the American Academy may have been valid at earlier times today under the complex forms in which industry is found it is not only unwise but unjust to hold the workman responsible for accidents which may occur to him on the assumption that he is a free agent and has the right of choice in his work European legislation has taken the entirely contrary attitude of assuming that accidents in the majority are traceable to causes inherent in industry and that as a result industry should be held responsible for them It is immaterial whether this conception has been extended to the ultimate thought of holding industry responsible for all accidents or for a limited number as is the case in certain countries where deliberate negligence on the part of the workman absolves the employer from liability The vital thought to be brought out here is the recognition not of liability on the part of either the employer or employee but rather the more progressive concept that since accidents do occur and may continue to occur notwithstanding all provisions for safeguarding the doc trine of compensation should be established In the last analysis this means that the consumer shall bear the burden Nor is it vital for the acceptance of this doctrine that the theory of compulsory compensation shall be introduced While the recent decision of the Court of Appeals of New York proclaims with emphasis the mature deliberation of a unanimous court that under our constitutional provisions any attempt at compulsory compensa tion infringes on the right accorded to individuals under the Consti tution that property may not be taken from them without due process of law it does not follow that the conception of a compulsory principle may not voluntarily be assumed by industry In fact it seems evident that if this farreaching decision of the Court of Appeals will hold enlightened manufacturers will realize not only the desirability but the necessity of making provision for indemni fying employees who may become injured in the pursuit of their employment This tendency is already apparent in many states and in many industries and its growth is only a matter of time On the assumption that compensation is the logical development in preference to the older theory of liability which per se involves a suggestion of tort it follows that in granting compensation a second principle suggests itself This too has been exemplified in the main in European legislation I refer to the granting in cases of accidents not to a lump sum compensation but rather to the 242Attitude of Foreign Countries provision which has been made in many instances for the care of the injured workmen during illness attending accident or for the granting of an invalidity pension should the injuries from the acci dent become permanent This thought has been carried to its highest conclusion in Germany where the principle of pension has been extended not only to the permanently injured workmen but to the granting of pensions to the widow and orphans in case of the death of the workman resulting from injury The purpose of this provision is clear The old liability theory assumes the necessity for indemnity and as a result in the past this indemnity has been measured on a money basis The compensation theory on the other hand while it involves a theory or principle of indemnity adds a finer better principle namely that of replacement In other words it is the intent of legislation of this kind not merely to give to dependents a cash consideration for the loss which has been suffered in the maiming or death of one who is frequently the principal wageearner but rather to attempt to replace in the family the earning ability which under normal circumstances would probably have been continued for an indefinite period The question will naturally arise Can the cost of such perma nent or continuous pensions be borne by the individual employer The answer can be made offhand in the negative Realizing this however it has been the effort on the part of European legislation to provide for the regular and continuous payments of pensions by requiring the employer to guarantee payments through some insur ance provision The weakness of some of the legislation proposed in the United States and the weakness of the English legislation may in part be traced to the absence of such provisions Accident like death may be looked upon as a contingency and risk of life and its frequency may today be measured in terms of actual experience While the laws which govern accident cannot be estimated with the finality which underlies the laws of a mortality table nevertheless there is sufficient statistical data to estimate with a fair degree of accuracy the costs of accidents upon which insurance rates can be based If proper protection is to be given not only to the workman but to the employer any sane scheme of compensation should have attached to it an insurance provision Still another thought is characteristic of most foreign legisla tion It is mentioned here for the reason that it has not received 243The Annals of the American Academy definite acceptance either in England or in the United States I refer to the belief that if industry is to be held liable for accidents with possibly certain limited exceptions then the amount of such liability likewise must be limited Any wellgrounded compensation scheme must assume in advance that industry cannot be subjected either to the whims of juries or to sentimental considerations All that industry should be expected to do is conveyed in the thought outlined above namely to attempt to replace for definite periods of time at least in part the contribution which the injured work man would have made for the support of his family These amounts since they are based on wages can be definitely calculated and form part of any wellplanned insurance scheme Finally it should be distinctly recognized in the United States that compensation for accidents is only one phase of a broader and larger movement directed towards the protection of workmen against the risks of industry Industrial accidents have been given promi nence in legislation of all countries for the reason that they are sudden and that their immediate effects are frequently serious It will probably be demonstrated eventually as a matter of fact that the other risks to which industry subjects workmen are equally as serious and probably affect larger numbers of workmen It is recog nized today equally in Europe and to a lesser extent and more recently in the United States that many diseases are the result of bad industrial conditions or to the strain and tension to which workmen are subjected Similarly the disability of workmen occur ring prematurely long before they have reached the allotted three score and ten can be traced to the effects of long hours of employ ment overwork strain etc Here too foreign legislation has taken the attitude that protection should be given to workmen against these contingencies It should be mentioned here again that this protection need not necessarily convey any idea of liability on the part of the employer or of the industry Instead there is the general assumption that there are risks and contingencies which arise in industry and against which the individual workman deserves protection It is only a further extension of this thought to maintain that since the individual workman himself is really not in a position to protect himself the greater part if not all of the burden should be borne by the employeror even as the thought is extended in 244Attitude of Foreign Countries certain countries that the state as a matter of wise public policy might assume a portion of this obligation I think it necessary that this idea should be strongly emphasized here if we are to develop accident legislation in the United States along safe lines If we are to benefit by the experience of our for eign neighbors we must agree with them that we have only partially done our duty in making provision for workmen against industrial accidents A comprehensive scheme of insurance for workingmen must include insurance against sickness against temporary or per manent invalidity and against death To what extent industry shall be chargeable with the cost of this protection what amount the employee should pay and whether the state should or should not be one of the contributing parties is immaterial for this discussion It is however essential that we shall recognize at the outset of all attempts to bring about a change of affairs in our state legislation the fundamental principles above adverted to When these are clearly recognized and understood it should in time be possible to effect rational and even uniform legislation which shall not be in conflict with our constitutional provisions When it appears proba ble that there is a unanimity and consensus of opinion as to the in troduction of these fundamental principles into our legislation it will probably be a comparatively simple matter should it be neces sary and this is still in doubt to amend the constitutional provisions which today apparently stand in the way of legislation This thought we believe crystallizes the opinion of modern men and women on the question of necessary protection for those who prose cute the industries of this country 245

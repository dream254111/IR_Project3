Different Distances during Rotation,i206982,C 71 3 VIII On the mutual action of the particles of magnetic bodies and on the law of variation of the magnetic forces generated at dfferent distances during rotation By S H CHRISTIE Esq M A F R S Read February 15 and 22 1826 1 N my Letter to Mr HERSCHEL published in the Transactions I communicated the results of some experiments which I had made with the view of determining according to what law of distance the magnetism developed in copper and other rfetals during rotation varied I was aware that all I could offer at that time must be considered as distant approxima tions towards useful results but as I had witnessed several of the very interesting experiments in which Mr HERSCHEL and Mr BABBAGE were engaged I was desirous that they should be in possession of whatever results I had obtained In these experiments I had made use of a thick copper plate revolving under a magnetized needle and of magnets revolv ing under a copper disc so that at different distances some of the forces which were brought into action during rotation had very different angles of inclination to the plane of the needle in the one case and to the plane of the disc in the other and in consequence of this the results were by no means uniform In order to remedy this I proposed instead of a disc to make use of a copper ring as in this case the poles of the magnet revolving vertically under it no lateral forces would be called into action and I expected that theMr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of law according to which the force acting during rotation varied at different distances would be determined with great precision In this expectation I was not disappointed and I now propose laying before the Society an account of these experiments and of the results which I obtained from them In making some preliminary trials with thin flat rings I found the effects produced so very much less than with a disc of the same weight that previously to pursuing the enquiry which I had at first in view I was induced to make some experiments in order to ascertain the effects that would be produced by a simple solution of continuity in a circular disc by concentric sections and likewise by successively removing concentric portions These experiments clearly show that the intensity of the magnetism developed during rotation is not alone materially affected by a separation across what may be termed the path of the induced pole as has been found to be the case by Mr BABBAGE and Mr HER SCHEL but that a separation concentric with that path by which the pole is undisturbed in its progress is equally effi cacious in diminishing the intensity of that pole  and that in the magnetism of the whole when all the parts are continu ous there is in all cases a great accumulation of intensity above the sum of the intensities of the separate parts This is so important a feature in the phenomena depending upon rotation that these experiments may not be considered unin teresting I shall therefore give an account of them previously to entering upon the principal object of this communication The nature of the apparatus which I employed on this and subsequent occasions will be best understood by a reference to Plate X A B is a very firm table having a vertical axis 72   l  N B1111 r  L E  i 1 A   i tthe particles of magnetic bodies c C

suspending wire ef is nipped tightly in a piece of slit brass by means of the screw d The lower end of the suspending wire is simi larly fixed between two small flat pieces of brass which below form a broad stirrup into which small wires from the angles of a light rectangular wooden scale may be passed and there crossing each other any torsion of the suspending wire immediately acts upon the scale and vice versa From the suspended scale a small piece of brass projects which indicates in circles and degrees on a large graduated ring MDCCCXXVII L 73Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of on the bottom of the screen P Q whatever torsion is given to the wire thus forming a very accurate balance of torsion The screen P Q having paper stretched tightly for the bottom and all the sides raised five inches prevented currents of air caused by the rotation of the magnets affecting the disc or ring suspended over them A B was so fixed that the axis C D and the suspending wire ef were in the same vertical line and with this line the centre of the graduated ring also coincided On the mutual action of the particles of magnetic bodies during rotation Having cut two discs of the same diameter from the same sheet of copper I suspended one of them at the distance of an inch from the upper horizontal surfaces of the magnets whose axes were vertical and south poles upwards and ascertained by means of this apparatus the effects that would be produced by making the magnets revolve under it with their axes at various distances from the axis of rotation I then observed the effect of making a circular cut through the disc at the distance of an inch from its circumference first when a portion was left uncut and next when the outer ring was entirely separated from the remaining inner disc The second disc was suspended by the same wire and at the same distance from the magnets and the effects which were pro duced by making successively circular cuts at different distances from the centre ascertained whether the interior portions were removed or retained The diameter of each of the discs was 8  inches the weight of that which I designate as I was 5298 grains that 74zthe particles of magnetic bodies c of II was 5232 grains I preferred making observations with discs having this difference in weight to empIoying a file to reduce them to the same In observing with the disc II glass weighing 66 grains was added and in every case where the weight of copper suspended was less than 5298 grains discs of wood and of glass were added to make up that weight in order that the tension of the suspending wire might be the same in all cases This wire was of hard brass of the size called by the wiredrawers No 22 its length 456 inches The disc I being placed in the scale at the distance of one inch from the upper surfaces of two 12 inch magnets these were adjusted in the frame G H with their flat faces towards the axis of rotation so that their axes were vertical and at the distance 4 inches from the axis of rotation or that these axes revolved directly under the edge of the disc The tube L M was turned until there was no torsion in the wire when the index on the scale pointed to zero on the graduated ring The magnets were now made to revolve in the direction of screwing with the angular velocity of 5 revolutions per second corresponding to one revolution of the handle in two seconds which velocity was always carefully preserved in all the subsequent experiments and the time in which the disc performed one two three c revolutions observed until it began to revolve in a direction contrary to that of the magnets the instant when this happened was noted and like wise the number of revolutions of the index and the degree where it pointed when it began to retrograde The same was done when the magnets revolved in the direction of unscrew ing and the means in the two directions taken Having no 75Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of assistance in making the experiments I could only note the time to the nearest second The numbers in the first column of the following table indicate the torsion of the suspending wire in circles or the number of revolutions performed by the disc from rest and in the following columns are set down the times in which these revolutions were performed when the magnets re volved at the several distances indicated

suppose that this force is equivalent to a certain force acting at the distance i from the centre of rotation and that this latter force would balance a torsion a of the wire or that it is equal to m

magnets agree with each other as nearly as could be expected excepting in two cases those corresponding to 0 s6o at the distances 32 inches and 27 inches which are so much greater than the other values of a at those distances that I am disposed to think the observations from which they are deduced inaccurate A slight impulse given to the disc when it was released at zero would dimi nish most sensibly the time of the first revolution and con sequently increase the corresponding value of a and as it was difficult to avoid this in all cases the inaccuracy in the obser vation might possibly arise from this cause I was not aware of the incongruity in these values of a until it was too late to repeat the observations having cut the disc and moved the apparatus before I made the computations Not only in these but in all the observations which I have made and from which I have computed the values of a I have almost invariably found that the values of a decrease as those of 0 from which they are deduced increase in 169 observa tions there are only 14 exceptions and in these in general the differences are so small that they most probably arose from small errors in the observations It would appear then that in all the experiments there must have been some circum stance which has a tendency to diminish the value of a as that of 0 increased It at first occurred to me that this might be a small deviation from the received law in the connection be tween the force exerted by the wire and its torsion but this I found was not the case as the results which I obtained by comparing the deviations of a magnetized needle with the torsion of the wire were extremely uniform If the force 78the particles of magnetic bodies c exerted by the wire be proportional to the torsion the torsion divided by the sine of the deviation should be constant Now the values which I obtained for this quotient with the torsions 71308 14275 214117 were 6600 6595 6634 the greatest difference among which is only the i65th part of the mean The resistance of the air would have a tendency to increase the whole time during which the disc continued to revolve in the direction of the magnets and consequently to diminish the values of a as those of 8 increased but not to a sufficient ex tent a diminution of 6 or 7 seconds in the whole time and in some instances more being required to account for this decrease in the value of a nor can the decrease arise from the small changes which take place in the relative velocity of the disc and the magnets Upon the whole I think it very probable that the values of a really decrease in the successive revolu tions of the disc and in this manner according to the prin ciple adopted in the very interesting Paper by Mr HERSCHEL and Mr BABBAGE on the magnetism manifested by various sub stances during rotation and so well supported by all the pheno mena hitherto observed the effect of the magnets upon the disc will depend upon the excess of the magnetism in those parts of the disc in the rear of the magnets above that in the parts in advance of them and if this excess were constant so would also be the value of a  but if on the magnets coming succes sively under any point that point has not parted with all the magnetism which it is capable of losing by the removal of the magnets to the opposite side of the disc there may be a gra dual though small accumulation of the magnetism left in every point of the disc and as only a certain portion of mag netism can be developed in each point during the time that the 79Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of nets are in its vicinity the excess which we have mentioned would be thus gradually diminished and consequently also the value of a The forces with which the magnets revolving at dif ferent distances with the same angular velocity urged the disc are proportional to the mean values of in Table II and to deduce the relative forces with which the magnets would urge the disc when revolving at different distances with the same linear velocity for instance that at the distance 42 inches the values of a must be increased in the inverse ratio of the respective distances since the forces cateris paribus are pro tional to the velocities This reduction is made in the folP lowing Table Table III istne f te a Inches Inches Inches Inches Inches Inches Distance of the axes of 1 the

distance at which the magnets would produce the maximum effect by revolving with the same linear velocity would be very nearly 244 inches The distance from the axis at which the magnets must re volve in order that the magnetism may be developed with the greatest intensity is less than this since in estimating this intensity the length of the lever at the extremity of which the magnets act must be taken into account We shall obtain at least approximately the relative intensities of the nduced magnetism when the magnets revolved at different 8othe particles of magnetic bodies c distances from the axis by increasing the numbers in Table III in the inverse ratio of those distances or by increasing the values of a in Table II in the inverse ratio of the squares of the distances Table IV  Dise

appears from these experiments that the in tensity of the induced magnetism would have been the greatest had the magnets revolved at the distance 2o7 inches nearly  that is so that their axes had been at the distance of half the radius of the disc from the centre This is what we might expect whatever may be the law according to which magnetism is developed in each particle but the great dimi nution in the intensity when the magnets revolved under the edge of the disc leads to an inference respecting the deve lopement of magnetism by induction by no means unim portant viz that continuity is much more essential than mass and that although a certain portion of magnetism is deve loped in each particle separately yet the whole of this is considerably less than that which appears to accumulate by the mutual action of particle upon particle for which action continuity appears to be requisite The measure of the magnetism developed in the copper if the magnets revolved at the distance 21 inches from the axis of rotation would interpolating roughly from the results in Table IV appear to be 4182 nearly so that 2091 would MDCCCXXVII MMr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of nearly measure the quantity developed on each side of the axes of the magnets The measure therefore of the mag netism developed when the magnets revolved with their axes under the edge of the disc if continuity produced no accumu lating effect ought certainly not to be less than 2091  but as it is actually only 68o05 it would appear that the continuity of mass on each side of the axes of the magnets has the effect of increasing the quantity of magnetism developed at least in the ratio of 3 to i The results which I obtained by making a circular cut in the disc lead to a similar conclusion In this case the mag nets were again adjusted to the distance 37 inches from the axis of rotation and the times in which the disc completed successive revolutions was noted as before A circular cut through the disc was now made at the distance of an inch from its edge excepting for an inch at the extremities of two diameters at right angles to each other as in fig i  after which the time at the completion of the revolutions was noted The same was done when the disc was cut as in fig 2  and finally as in fig 3 in which case tissue paper was placed between the ring cut off and the interior disc Figl rig 2 ig 3

magnets revolving at the same distance in all cases the mean values of a are measures of the magnetism developed under the different circumstances The diminution of effect is sufficiently striking in the case of the ring remain ing attached to the interior disc by four inches of its circum ference as in fig i but it is still greater in proportion when the connection between them is further diminished by one half as in fig 2 and no very striking effect beyond this is produced by rendering the separation complete If any doubts could be entertained of the correctness of the infer ence respecting the effect of the absence of continuous matter which I have drawn from the experiments when the magnets revolved at different distances from the axis under the entire disc these last experiments by exhibiting the effect itself in the most striking manner precisely of the same nature and nearly in the same degree must entirely remove them 83Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of After having made these experiments I ascertained what would be the effect produced when the magnets revolved under the separated ring alone and likewise under the re maining disc alone first when the axes of the magnets were at the distance 37 inches from the axis of rotation that is remaining as in the foregoing experiments secondly when they revolved at the distance 32 inches from the axis that is having their axes under the inner edge of the ring or the edge of the remaining disc Table VI The distance of the axes of the magnets from the axis of rotation  37 inches 32 inches  IIIPU  K Mr I A v

corresponding to the distance 37 inches is rather greater than the value of a when the magnets revolved at the same distance under the disc and ring together  so that it would appear that no increase in the magnetism takes place in consequence of the proximity of the two masses That the sum of the value of a corresponding to the ring and disc separately exceeds that of a corresponding to the ring and disc together Table V probably arises from a circumstance which affected slightly all the results Al though the direct communication between the disc and the currents of air arising from the rotation of the magnets was cut off by a screen of paper stretched on a frame with sides considerably raised  yet a slight current of air was produced 84the particles of magnetic bodies c near the disc which increased the final arc of torsion 20 or 30o or the values of a 1o or 15 as nearly as I could determine by making the magnets revolve under discs of wood and glass of the same weight as the large copper disc As I did not consider that the torsion could in all cases be determined within much less limits than this I preferred giving the ob servations as they were made to applying a correction which was doubtful in its amount When the magnets revolved at the distance 32 inches the sum of the values of a is 444 and we may take this as the value of a when the magnets revolved under the disc and ring together at that distance Now we have seen Table II that when they revolved at the distance 32 inches from the axis under the uncut disc the value of a was 15287 so that here the magnetism developed was diminished by the circular separation in the ratio of 344 to i I now placed the disc II in the scale and having deter mined the effects that were produced by making the magnets revolve under it with their axes at the distance of 32 inches from the axis of rotation their upper surfaces being at the distance of an inch from the disc and their angular velocity 5 revolutions in a second the same as before I determined successively the effects produced by making circular cuts at the distances 7 inch 12 inch 17 inch 22 inches from the centre I ascertained the effects both when the pieces in the interior were removed and when they were retained except ing in the first case of the small disc 4 inch in diameter which was removed and glass of the same weight substituted in the first experiment but was afterwards replaced with the rings cut out in the others The differences in the results 8586 Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of when the parts were retained and when they were removed and glass substituted were so small that I shall only give the results where they were retained excepting in the case of the largest circle In all cases tissue paper was placed between the pieces to prevent contact 1Fig1 Fig2 Fig4 Table VII The magnets revolving with their axes at the distance 32 inches from the axis of rotation 1 4PE  lZi  Disc cutas Fig 4 Disc uncut Disc cut as

observations where the whole number of revolutions of the disc is 7 or 8 as in this case When the magnets revolved under the disc I with their axes at the distance 3s2 inches from the axis of rotation the same as in the present instance the value of a was 15287 Table II and when they revolved at the same distance under the ring whose diameters were 64 inches and 84 inches its value was 16o05 Table VI so that the quantity of magnetism whose developement was prevented by the removal of the disc diameter 64 inches is proportional to 13682 Now taking 32 as the quotient arising from divi ding the number representing the quantity of magnetism destroyed by the square of the diameter of the disc removed 1310o7 will represent the quantity of magnetism destroyed by the removal of the disc diameter 64 inches Supposing the law to be correct the difference between this number de duced from the observations with the disc 2 and the preced ing deduced from those with the disc  is not very far beyond the limits of errors in the observations even had they 87Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of in all the cases been made with the same disc and certainly the agreement is as near as we could expect from observa tions made with different discs If the agreement of all these results with so simple a law is to be considered as fortuitous the coincidence is certainly most singular but I am disposed to think that the law in nature is really this that the quantities of magnetism destroyed by removing concentric portions from the interior of the disc are proportional to the mass removed but that they have not generally the same ratio to the whole magnetism developed in the uncut disc which the portion removed from the disc has to the whole disc that is if d is the diameter of the uncut disc and a represent the magnetism developed in it d1 and d the diameters of portions removed and   the magnetism developed in the disc when those portions are removed the magnets revolving at the same distance from the axis in each case then ccaoa db a and is not equal to  but M q   where q will be constant so long as the magnets revolve at the same distance from the axis but will vary with that distance In the present instance the magnets revolving at the distance 3 2 inches from the axis the values of q derived from the different observations are 148 145 1 53 154 giving a mean 15o Here then the magnetism destroyed by the removal of concentric portions from the interior of the disc has a considerably greater ratio to the whole magnetism developed than the mass removed has to the whole From the great diminution in the intensity of the induced 88the particles of magnetic bodies c magnetism which takes place on making a circular cut in the disc especially near to the magnets it would follow that if a copper disc were reduced to a series of concentric rings of small breadth the magnetism developed in it would be scarcely appreciable under whatever part the magnets might revolve the same would follow from the experiment of Mr BABBAGE and Mr IERSCHEL if a copper disc by conti nual cutting in the direction of radii were reduced nearly to a series of very small sectors so that if a disc were separated in both directions so as to be reduced to pieces of small magnitude even though not in a state of powder there can I think be no doubt that the induced magnetism would be rendered insensible The value of a Table VII when the disc was cut as in fig 4 the rings and small disc being retained is rather less than its value when they were removed this however is only to be attributed to the almost unappreciable effect produced by the pieces in the interior and unavoidable errors of obser vation This will be evident from the results in the following table obtained by placing an entire disc 44 inches in dia meter in the ring instead of the small disc and rings The observations were made some time after the preceding when the apparatus had been moved and the disc was not at pre cisely the same distance from the magnets which was the reason of the efects being less than before The magnets revolved at the same distance from the axis as before s3 inches first under the ring diameters 44 inches and 84 inches with the disc 44 inches in diameter in the interior then under the ring alone and afterwards under the disc alone The effect of even a slight current of air was

possibly be expected equal to the value of a when they revolved under the ring and disc together If we attribute the whole difference to error in determining the value of a when the magnets revolved under the disc alone which however I have no reason for thinking should be done the value of a would still in this case be only 23 Increasing this in proportion to the values of c in Table VII the mag netism developed in the uncut disc diameter 84 inches that in the ring alone diameters 84 and 44 inches and that in the disc alone diameter 44 inches would very nearly be represented respectively by 1517 880 and 26 That the magnetism destroyed by the removal of a portion gothe particles of magnetic bodies c of any mass should be more than a proportional part of the whole does not appear extraordinary but that the removal of a portion in which separately the magnetism developed is represented by 26 should cause a diminution represented by 637 in the magnetism developed in the mass or more than 24 times its separate effect and that the separation should be nearly equivalent to the removal are striking and I think important facts in the investigation of the laws according to which magnetism is communicated to and distributed in re volving bodies These results are in perfect accordance with those which I have deduced from the experiments with the disc I It follows then from these experiments that in the de velopement of induced magnetism by rotation every portion of a mass contributes towards the intensity of the magnetism developed and that in a much greater ratio than would by direct induction be due to that portion according to its distance from the magnet so that there appears to be as it were an accumulation of magnetism arising from the mutual action of the several particles upon each other continuity throughout has thus a much greater influence than mass a complete solution of continuity when it does not take place in the parts adjacent to the magnet is very nearly equivalent to an entire removal of the remoter mass so separated and in all cases the effect produced by complete separation is not much less than that produced by removal 9lMr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of On the law of a of the va magnetc forces generated at dfferent distances during rotation I have already stated that with the view of determining this law from experiment I made use of a ring instead of a disc This ring is of cast copper circular and of uniform thickness its weight and dimensions as follow weight 32s75 ounces troy inner diameter i oo inches outer diameter i r9 inches thickness 24 inch As I was desirous of avoiding using a file on it the copper was simply cleared from the mould and the small inequalities on its surface would consequently give all the measures in excess so that its specific gravity is higher than 80954 which these dimensions would give The mode which I adopted for suspending the ring was tiisan assem blage of four small wires No 18 was fixed at the extremi ties of a diameter so that when stretcied the middle was about two inches above the ring and another similar assem blage fixed in the same mainer at the extremities of the diameter at right angles these were made to cross through the stirrup at f as I have before described so that there could be no play in it that is the ring could not be turned either wayithout immediately twistingthe suspending wire A double wire of the size No 2 was attached to the stirrup and after the ring had been suspended by it for several hours its length was found to be 4625 inches To the ring two pieces of wood having small slips of brass projecting for indexes were attached diametrically opposite to each other these with the wires fixed to the ring made the whole weight supported by the suspending wire 3256 ounces troy The magnets before made use of the dimensions of which 9ethe particles of magnetic bodies Sc are length 12 inches breadth 9 inch thickness s6 inch were fixed vertically in the frame G H equally distant from the axis of rotation their edges towards that axis their south poles upwards and upper surfaces horizontal The distance between the inner edges of the magnets was o10 o inches  between their outer edges 11 85 inches so that their axes revolved exactly under the middle section of the ring and they described a ring directly under the copper ring of as nearly as possible the same horizontal dimensions The screen P Q being removed the ring was lowered until it just touched without resting upon the upper surfaces of the magnets when the distance between K and M on the tube LMI was ascertained 733 inches adding 12 inch to this 745 inches would have been the distance between K and M if the middle horizontal section of the ring could have coin cided with the upper surfaces of the magnets By subtracting in any case the distance between K and M from this number 745 inches I had very accurately the distance between the upper surfaces of the magnets and the middle horizontal section of the copper ring After finishing the experments the screen PQ was removed and the ring again lowered until as before it just touched the upper surfaces of the magnets when the distance between K and M was found to be 734 inches so that the wire could not have stretched during the experiments the small difference oi inch must be attri buted to slight inequalities on the surface of the copper The magnets being made as before to revolve 5 times in a second in the direction of screwing and preserving this velocity very carefully in

inner circunmference of the graduated ring on which the deviations and revolutions of the copper ring were measured and which rested upon the screen but this produced no effect at least that was sensible even at this small distance for after removing the graduated ring the times of completing the several revolutions of the copper ring and like wise the whole arc of torsion before it came to rest were found to be as nearly as posible the same as they were previous to the removalthe particles of magnetic bodies c In order to obtain from these experiments the law accord ing to which the force urging the ring at different distances varied I assume that the whole action of the magnets may be referred to a single point near the extremity in each as a pole and I consider that within certain limits of the distances of the point acted on no sensible error will arise from this supposition My first trials were to ascertain whether this force varied inversely as any exact power of the distance and I found that the supposition that it varied inversely as the 4th power of the distance would give results approximating very closely to those obtained by observation As however on the principle that time is requisite both for the develope ment and for the dissipation of magnetism the induced poles in the ring would always be in the rear of the magnets it appeared probable that the supposition of the force varying inversely as some power of the distance between the pole of each magnet and a point in the ring at a certain distance in the rear of it would give results approximating even more closely to the observations and on trial I found that this was decidedly the case Calling c the vertical distance of the upper surface of the magnets from the middle horizontal section of the ring p the distance of the poles of the magnets from their upper sur faces and s a constant horizontal distance from the pole of either magnet to a point behind it in the ring I found that the formula I pM  C  1 where M and p are constants which with E are to be deter mined from the observations gave results approximating much more closely to the observations than the formula 9596 3Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of   M 4 That an estimate may be formed of the degree of coinci dence I shall give the comparison of the observations with the results obtained in both cases Putting

have excluded all combinations in which two consecutive observations en tered This however makes but a very small difference in the results since the mean value of M deduced from the thirtyfive combinations of the seven observations is 236z and its value deduced from the ten combinations in which consecutive observations are excluded is 23314 The mean value of M being obtained the value of p

the observations and the values of et derived from the separate observations Table II MDCCCXXVI  97 0Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of The differences here between some of the values of M and p and their mean values may appear more considerable than they ought to be if the formula from which they are derived be correct but it is to be observed that even very small errors in the observations are rendered very sensible by thus combining them With regard to the differences in the values of 2 supposing the formula to be correct and the observations to have been liable to no other errors than those in estimating the distances between the magnets and the ring an error in this respect of yo inch would cause a greater difference than any here between the different values of E and the mean As I took every precaution to ensure accuracy I consider that although I might be liable to an error to this amount I was not liable to a greater The best criterion of the correctness of the formula is however the agreement of the observed values of a with those deduced from it by employing these mean values of M p and e2 and likewise the agreement in the values of these quantities deduced from the separate observations The comparison between the observed values of a and those computed from the formula a tpc i  assuming M  23314 p  1052 and e  1504 is made in the following table Table III Values

of the degree of coincidence between the observed and computed values of a since the magnitude of the errors to which the observations are liable depends upon the magnitude of a The greatest discordance between the observed and computed values of a whether estimated by their actual difference or by dividing this difference by the computed value of a is that corresponding to the least distance of the ring from the magnets but even this amounts to little more than a fortieth of the whole Perhaps it would have been as well to have omitted this observation altogether since the distance of the ring from the magnets was so small that supposing that distance to have been 51 inch instead of 50 or that an error of ol was made in estimating it the difference between the observed and computed values of a would have been  394 instead of  534 Having however made the observations with great care from this close agreement between the values of a deduced from the formula a p  c

decidedly greater than the corresponding quotients in Table III Considering these quotients as the errors arising from the respective formulas and that the sum of the squares of the errors is the best criterion of correctness it appears that the sum of the squares of these errors in the 5th and 8th columns respectively are 014417 and 012869 and that the sum of the squares of the errors in the 5th column of Table III is only oo so0 or not a tenth of the 100the particles of magnetic bodies c least sum in the other case It is manifest then that the introduction of the quantity e into the expression for the value of o renders it essentially more accurate and the result of these different comparisons is I think quite decisive of the correctness of the formula  p e E I have stated in my letter to Mr HERsCHEL that when a thick copper plate revolved under a needle the force by which the plate urged the needle appeared to vary nearly as the inverse 4th power of the distance but that when magnets revolved horizontally under a copper disc the force with which they urged it appeared to vary according to a law approximating rather towards that of the inverse square of the distance The difference of the law in the two cases arose no doubt from a light copper disc having been sus pended over strong bar magnets in the second experiment instead of suspending the heavy copper plate over the needle used in the first experiment which could not have been con veniently done as its weight is about 16lbs but which would have reversed the experiment To remove any doubt that might arise from this apparent incongruity I determined now precisely to reverse the experiment in the two cases making the copper ring revolve under the same magnets over which it had been before suspended As however I could not suspend the magnets vertically over the ring without increasing so considerably the weight to be suspended by the apparatus to fix them in that the wire by which the ring had been suspended would no longer sustain them and  Phil Trans 1 85 101Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of indeed that no wire on the torsion of which any sensible effect could be produced would do so the preceding experi ments could not be made use of as strictly comparative with others in which the ring should revolve under the mag nets It therefore became necessary to make a different adjustment of the magnets in the first instance under the copper The magnets used in the preceding experiments were now placed horizontally and parallel to each other on their flat sides on the top of the frame G H with their poles of the same name adjacent and their nearest sides at the distance 34 inch from each other The copper ring remained sus pended by the same wire as in the preceding experiments and being lowered until its under surface just touched with out resting upon two brass nuts fixing the magnets to the frame the distance between K and M was ascertained to be 9575 inches so that the distance from the under surface of the magnets to the under surface of the ring being 59 inch the thickness of the ring 24 inch and that of the magnets 36 inch the distance between K and M would have been lo01o5 could the middle horizontal section of the ring have coincided with the axes of the magnets which distance was therefore in this case to be considered as zero on the scale measuring the distances between the middle horizontal sec tion of the ring in any case and the horizontal plane passing through the axes of the magnets I have before mentionedthat from the formula   J I had found p or the distance of the poles of the magnets from their extremities to be 256 inch which as I was not aware 162the particles of magnetic bodies c 1os at the time that any other formula would more closely repre sent the observations I considered to be a near approximation and that consequently this value of p was correct and as I wished to see how far the effects produced by the magnets revolving with their axes vertical agreed with the effects when they revolved with their axes horizontal and their poles at the same distances from the ring I regulated the distances at which I observed in the latter case according to this value of p This will account for the peculiar distances at which I made observations which might otherwise appear somewhat singular The results which I obtained are arranged in the following table Table V  c  V  cr 2 E o Distance of the middle o    section of the ring from  o506 inch i256 inch oo6 inch 0756 inch w0  J the axesof the magnets J Ia    o

they were in the preceding case and when the index on the scale between their south poles pointed in the magnetic meridian there was no torsion in the wire The suspending wire if produced would have bisected the line equidistant from the axes of the magnets and passed through the axis of rotation The ring was firmly fixed on the top of the frame G H so as to revolve horizontally in its own plane about its centre under the magnets and the same precautions as before were taken in order to determine accurately the distance between K and M corresponding to the zero of distance between the middle section of the ring and the axes of the magnets I have before stated that the weight suspended in the preceding experiments was 3256 ounces in the present case the weight of the magnets scale c suspended by the same wire was 33475 ounces so that the tension was rather more than before but this difference was unavoidable as the weight of the magnets alone is nearly equal to that of the ring The effects produced at different distances by the rotation of the ring being measured by the deviation of the magnets from the meridian in order to compare these effects with those observed when the magnets revolved under the ring it was necessary to determine the degree of torsion equivalent to any deviation of this compound needle For this purpose the suspending wire was twisted 2 4 6 circles by making the magnets describe 2 4 6 circles first in the direction of screwing then in the contrary direction noting the corres io8the particles of magnetic bodies c ponding deviations of the index oh the compound needle and the mean of the deviations in opposite directions being taken the ratio of the torsion to the sine of the deviation was obtained the following are the results Deviation of

direction of screwing and this velocity was carefully maintained until the needle became steady in its direction when the devia tion marked by the index was noted the same was done in the direction of unscrewing and the mean of these deviations was taken as the deviation due to the rotation of the ring When the distance between the middle section of the ring and the axes of the magnets exceeded 2 inches the deviation was so small that the errors to which the observation of it was liable 2 or 3 bore too great a proportion to the whole for me to place much reliance on the observations and I consequently have not noted the deviation at the distance 2756 inches In the following table are contained the observed deviations the torsion equivalent to the force urging the magnets during

when revolving horizontally under it we shall find the j i  tthe particlcs of magnetic bodies c agreement such that there can be no doubt that the forces are the same at the same distances in the two cases The mean value of a at the distance 756 inch when the magnets revolved was 1811r7  but it is to be observed that the value of a in the present instance 17773 should not be compared with this but with 176375 that value of a which is half the arc of torsion when the ring comes to rest previously to turning in the contrary direction to that of the rotation of the magnets since in the present case the rotation of the ring was continued until it balanced steadily the directive force of the magnets This consideration greatly diminishes the difference in the two cases and will account also in some measure for the values of M and s2 being different in Table VI and Table IX but I must likewise state that the observa tions when the ring revolved under the magnets were liable to errors which did not affect those in the reverse form of the experiment although I took great care to determine correctly the direction of the index to the magnets when the force of rotation balanced the directive force The comparison between the values of a contained in the preceding table and those computed for the several values of c from the formula 5  making M  4663 and E 5491 is made in the following

deduced from the separate observations in each of the foregoing cases be considered as a test of the correctness of these formulas there can I think be no doubt that they will very accurately represent the effects that are produced whether by the rotation of magnets on a copper ring or on magnets by the rotation of a ring within certain limits of the distance between the magnets and the ring Having succeeded in determining from experiment the law according to which the forces acting during rotation varied at different distances for which purpose principally I had under taken these experiments my next object was to ascertain whether the formula I had obtained would result from the principle that time is necessary both for the developement of magnetism by induction and for its dissipation and which appeared to be implied in the formula 1 1the particles of magnetic bodies c We have as yet no facts which indicate on what function of the time either the developement or dissipation of mag netism depends and until this can be ascertained there appears little prospect of obtaining a complete solution to this interesting but intricate problem in magnetism It appeared to me not improbable that when the distance of a magnetic pole from a body capable of becoming magnetic by induction is suddenly decreased the magnetism developed in any very small portion of time varies as the time and the magnetism yet remaining to be developed before it has attained the maximum intensity of which it is susceptible at this dimi nished distance and which may be called the intensity due to this distance and that on the contrary on the removal of the pole the magnetism dissipated varies as the time and the excess of the intensity above the minimum at the increased distance the rate of developement and dissipation not being however cateris paribus necessarily the same I accordingly assumed this in order to obtain the intensity of the mag netism in any point of the ring in terms of its distance from the pole of the magnet but although the differential equa tion that would result from this assumption is integrable so that the intensity of the point may be determined yet as it is in a series whose convergency depends upon the smallness of the angular distance between that point and the point vertically over the pole of the magnet and a second inte gration is required to deduce the force with which the mag nets urge the ring the result is rendered so complicated that to reduce it to any form with which the formula I have obtained from experiment may be compared appears almost a hopeless task I consider therefore that in order to obtain MDCCCXXVII Q 113Mr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of theoretical results it is better to adopt in a more general way the principle to which I have referred According to this principle the magnetism in the ring will not be developed with the greatest intensity in the point which is vertical to the pole of the magnet at any instant but in a point at a certain distance behind it and in every point in advance of this and likewise in those behind magnetism will be developed with an intensity depending upon their distances from the pole of the magnet In the points behind the intensity will be greater than what I have termed the inten sity due to the distance of the magnet in those in advance less but the same distribution of magnetism in the ring will constantly follow the magnet during its rotation under it with the same uniform velocity The effect of the magnetism in the points behind the pole of the magnet will be to urge the ring with a constant force in the direction of rotation that of the magnetism in those in advance to urge it in a contrary direction likewise with a constant force so that the ring will be urged in the direction of rotation with a force which is equivalent to the excess of the former force above the latter We may therefore assume that the whole force of the parts of the ring in advance of the magnet will be destroyed by the force of only a portion of the part behind and that the ring is continually urged in the direction of rotation by the undiminished force of the remaining portion of the part behind so that to obtain the force of the whole we shall have to integrate from one extremity of this portion to the other Let r be the radius of the circle described by the poles of the magnets or the radius of that circle in the ring vertically i4lthe particles of magnetic bodies c over them and on which I suppose the whole action to take place s the arc of the latter circle between the point which is vertical to the pole of one of the magnets and the portion d s whose force is to be determined Referring the induced magnetism developed in every magnetic particle in d s to two poles the force with which these poles act upon the pole of the magnet and consequently with which this pole acts upon them will vary directlyas the intensity of the magnetism de veloped and inversely as the square of the distance the south pole of the magnet that which in the experiments was nearest to the ring will attract the induced north pole and repel the induced south pole according to this law and the axis of polarisation will be in the direction of the line joining the centre of the particle and the pole ofthe magnet If we call the intensity of the magnetism developed in each induced pole i the distance of each pole from the centre of the par ticle k the distance of the centre of the particle from the pole of the magnet p then the action of the magnet on the particle in the direction of the line drawn from its centre to that of the magnet being the difference of the attractive and repulsive forces on the two poles will be represented by i Pe e  k  or by i  p or since k is exceedingly small compared with p by 4pG ki p being a constant multiplier As this will represent the force on each magnetic particle in ds the whole force on ds taking m for the constant mul tiplier may be represented by 4 mids p3 115116 AMr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of or if p be the angular distance of ds from the point vertically over the pole of the magnet by 4mirdp p3 The force on d s or r d p in the direction of a tangent to the ring that which urges it in the direction of the rotation of the magnet will therefore be represented by 4 m i r sin p dq p4 The intensity i is as I have before mentioned greater than that due to the distance p let us then suppose that it is the intensity corresponding to a position of the magnet at a very small distance w behind its position at the instant at which we are estimating the force of the magnet on ds Considering as a right line the distance between this point and ds will be  c r sin p    r 1  cos p  or  ct2

4i being plus this will diminish the second term which is minus so that with these limitations we may consider M     M  jr  c 2 r I cos as a very close approximation to the value of the force with which the magnets urge the ring In order to obtain a more precise estimate of the value of the terms omitted let us compare this value of the force with  4r0 3 s 117 elMr CHRISTIE on the mutual action of f M C 7E7 obtained from the experiments It appears from the experiments Tables II and III that E2 is very nearly 15 and r is nearly 55 or r2 nearly so so that putting 9 r2 1  cos 4 2 we have cos   9975 and  4  In the extreme case in the experiments in Table I the distance from the upper surface of the magnets to the middle horizontal section of the ring is 25 inches and therefore from the value afterwards deduced for p d  2 6 nearly which is less than  r  but supposing c  r and taking only the first two terms the expression for the force will be 6 M X r4 10404 8I  Here without even taking into consideration the diminution of the second term by those multiplied by 4 the error arising from the omission of this term in the expression for the force will not in this an extreme case amount to 8 of the whole We have obtained the expression for the force with which the magnets urge the ring on the supposition that the mag nets revolve with the same uniform velocity in all cases considering that velocity as the unit of velocity but it is evident that for any other velocity this expression must be multiplied by the velocity As the value of A will also de pend upon the velocity this value may be so considerably increased that the first term will no longer give an approxi mate value of the force Beyond a certain velocity the value of 4 may increase with the velocity and we may even con ceive the velocity to be so far increased that 4 becoming  r ll 8itheparticles of magnetic bodies c the expression for the force will become equal to o and with a still farther increase of the velocity the force will become negative and the motion of the ring consequently retrograde The velocity that would be required to produce this effect with copper may be much beyond what could be produced with the requisite apparatus but as the value of 4 the magnets revolving with the same velocity must vary considerably with different substances it is by no means improbable that with steel slightly hardened or perhaps even with hammered iron a retrograde motion might be produced by an angular velocity more within our command The success of this experiment would afford a very striking illus tration of the principle which is the basis of the preceding calculation With regard to the value of d all that we can infer from the experiments is that it must be extremely small If c6 then 0 0ooo05 would reduce the expression for the force to its first term and the same would be the case when c 7 or c  646 if  o038 Taking w to be oi the error that would arise by neglecting the second and following terms in the expression for the force considering the first term as  would be 0147 when c  6  and it would be  0084 when c  2646 the first term being also considered as i in this case This probably is not far from the real value of  in the present instance since if it were much greater than ol the error that would arise from neglecting it when c is small would be considerable and would be minus and although this is the case in the results in Tables VII and X it is not so in that in Table III The errors however by which the observations would be affected from a I11120 Mr CHRISTIE Ofn the mutual action of small error i the distance when c is so small as 6 or 7 inch are considerable and to this source we ought perhaps to attribute the error in the last observation in Table III being plus instead of minus as it ought to be from the omis sion of the second and following terms It appears then that within the limits of the values of the distance c at which the observations were made w being extremely small andi A about 4 we may without any sen sible error omit the second and following terms in the expression for the force which is thus reduced to the form which represents very accurately the several values of a which is the measure of that force in the experiments I am aware that it may be objected to the method of inves tigation which I have adopted that the value of 4 may not be constant for different values of d nor that of w be constant for every point of the ring behind the portion r 4 even for the same value of c but the variations of these being evi dently within very narrow limits no sensible error can arise from supposing them constant the perfect coincidence between the formula deduced on this supposition and that previously obtained from the experiments proves clearly that this is the case and that the assumptions which I have made are perfectly admissible After the very satisfactory explanation which Mr BABBAGE and Mr HERSCHEL have given of the general phaenomena observed during rotation on the principle that time is requi site both for the developement and for the dissipation of magnetism fully to establish the truth of the principle it remained only to show that the results obtained from Phil Trans for I825the particles of magnetic bodies c 1 2 calculation founded on that principle perfectly accord with those obtained from experiment and this I trust I have done by the preceding experimental and theoretical details Considering this then as an established principle future in vestigations must be directed to the discovery of the function of the time on which the intensity of the induced magnetism depends during the approach of a magnetic pole towards a physical point susceptible of magnetism and also during its recess I have stated what I consider to be not an impro bable law but the whole time occupied either in the deve lopement of magnetism by induction or in its dissipation is so minute that it appears extremely difficult to devise expe riments that would be a direct test of such laws and to the more indirect tests derived from a comparison of such expe rimental results as the foregoing with theoretical results derived from these laws difficulties of analysis in general oppose themselves Royal Military Academy 7th June i826 MDCCCXXVIi R

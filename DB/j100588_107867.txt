J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107867,ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES AND ON THE LAW OF VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC FORCES GENERATED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES DURING ROTATION,I206982,C 71 3 VIII ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES AND ON THE LAW OF VARIATION OF THE MAGNETIC FORCES GENERATED AT DFFERENT DISTANCES DURING ROTATION BY S H CHRISTIE ESQ M A F R S READ FEBRUARY 15 AND 22 1826 1 N MY LETTER TO MR HERSCHEL PUBLISHED IN THE TRANSACTIONS I COMMUNICATED THE RESULTS OF SOME EXPERIMENTS WHICH I HAD MADE WITH THE VIEW OF DETERMINING ACCORDING TO WHAT LAW OF DISTANCE THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN COPPER AND OTHER RFETALS DURING ROTATION VARIED I WAS AWARE THAT ALL I COULD OFFER AT THAT TIME MUST BE CONSIDERED AS DISTANT APPROXIMA TIONS TOWARDS USEFUL RESULTS BUT AS I HAD WITNESSED SEVERAL OF THE VERY INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH MR HERSCHEL AND MR BABBAGE WERE ENGAGED I WAS DESIROUS THAT THEY SHOULD BE IN POSSESSION OF WHATEVER RESULTS I HAD OBTAINED IN THESE EXPERIMENTS I HAD MADE USE OF A THICK COPPER PLATE REVOLVING UNDER A MAGNETIZED NEEDLE AND OF MAGNETS REVOLV ING UNDER A COPPER DISC SO THAT AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES SOME OF THE FORCES WHICH WERE BROUGHT INTO ACTION DURING ROTATION HAD VERY DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCLINATION TO THE PLANE OF THE NEEDLE IN THE ONE CASE AND TO THE PLANE OF THE DISC IN THE OTHER AND IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THE RESULTS WERE BY NO MEANS UNIFORM IN ORDER TO REMEDY THIS I PROPOSED INSTEAD OF A DISC TO MAKE USE OF A COPPER RING AS IN THIS CASE THE POLES OF THE MAGNET REVOLVING VERTICALLY UNDER IT NO LATERAL FORCES WOULD BE CALLED INTO ACTION AND I EXPECTED THAT THEMR CHRISTIE ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FORCE ACTING DURING ROTATION VARIED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES WOULD BE DETERMINED WITH GREAT PRECISION IN THIS EXPECTATION I WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED AND I NOW PROPOSE LAYING BEFORE THE SOCIETY AN ACCOUNT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AND OF THE RESULTS WHICH I OBTAINED FROM THEM IN MAKING SOME PRELIMINARY TRIALS WITH THIN FLAT RINGS I FOUND THE EFFECTS PRODUCED SO VERY MUCH LESS THAN WITH A DISC OF THE SAME WEIGHT THAT PREVIOUSLY TO PURSUING THE ENQUIRY WHICH I HAD AT FIRST IN VIEW I WAS INDUCED TO MAKE SOME EXPERIMENTS IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN THE EFFECTS THAT WOULD BE PRODUCED BY A SIMPLE SOLUTION OF CONTINUITY IN A CIRCULAR DISC BY CONCENTRIC SECTIONS AND LIKEWISE BY SUCCESSIVELY REMOVING CONCENTRIC PORTIONS THESE EXPERIMENTS CLEARLY SHOW THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED DURING ROTATION IS NOT ALONE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY A SEPARATION ACROSS WHAT MAY BE TERMED THE PATH OF THE INDUCED POLE AS HAS BEEN FOUND TO BE THE CASE BY MR BABBAGE AND MR HER SCHEL BUT THAT A SEPARATION CONCENTRIC WITH THAT PATH BY WHICH THE POLE IS UNDISTURBED IN ITS PROGRESS IS EQUALLY EFFI CACIOUS IN DIMINISHING THE INTENSITY OF THAT POLE  AND THAT IN THE MAGNETISM OF THE WHOLE WHEN ALL THE PARTS ARE CONTINU OUS THERE IS IN ALL CASES A GREAT ACCUMULATION OF INTENSITY ABOVE THE SUM OF THE INTENSITIES OF THE SEPARATE PARTS THIS IS SO IMPORTANT A FEATURE IN THE PHENOMENA DEPENDING UPON ROTATION THAT THESE EXPERIMENTS MAY NOT BE CONSIDERED UNIN TERESTING I SHALL THEREFORE GIVE AN ACCOUNT OF THEM PREVIOUSLY TO ENTERING UPON THE PRINCIPAL OBJECT OF THIS COMMUNICATION THE NATURE OF THE APPARATUS WHICH I EMPLOYED ON THIS AND SUBSEQUENT OCCASIONS WILL BE BEST UNDERSTOOD BY A REFERENCE TO PLATE X A B IS A VERY FIRM TABLE HAVING A VERTICAL AXIS 72   L  N B1111 R  L E  I 1 A   I TTHE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C C

MEANS OF THIS APPARATUS THE EFFECTS THAT WOULD BE PRODUCED BY MAKING THE MAGNETS REVOLVE UNDER IT WITH THEIR AXES AT VARIOUS DISTANCES FROM THE AXIS OF ROTATION I THEN OBSERVED THE EFFECT OF MAKING A CIRCULAR CUT THROUGH THE DISC AT THE DISTANCE OF AN INCH FROM ITS CIRCUMFERENCE FIRST WHEN A PORTION WAS LEFT UNCUT AND NEXT WHEN THE OUTER RING WAS ENTIRELY SEPARATED FROM THE REMAINING INNER DISC

MAGNETS AGREE WITH EACH OTHER AS NEARLY AS COULD BE EXPECTED EXCEPTING IN TWO CASES THOSE CORRESPONDING TO 0 S6O AT THE DISTANCES 32 INCHES AND 27 INCHES WHICH ARE SO MUCH GREATER THAN THE OTHER VALUES OF A AT THOSE DISTANCES THAT I AM DISPOSED TO THINK THE OBSERVATIONS FROM WHICH THEY ARE DEDUCED INACCURATE A SLIGHT IMPULSE GIVEN TO THE DISC WHEN IT WAS RELEASED AT ZERO WOULD DIMI NISH MOST SENSIBLY THE TIME OF THE FIRST REVOLUTION AND CON SEQUENTLY INCREASE THE CORRESPONDING VALUE OF A AND AS IT WAS DIFFICULT TO AVOID THIS IN ALL CASES THE INACCURACY IN THE OBSER VATION MIGHT POSSIBLY ARISE FROM THIS CAUSE I WAS NOT AWARE OF THE INCONGRUITY IN THESE VALUES OF A UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE TO REPEAT THE OBSERVATIONS HAVING CUT THE DISC AND MOVED THE APPARATUS BEFORE I MADE THE COMPUTATIONS NOT ONLY IN THESE BUT IN ALL THE OBSERVATIONS WHICH I HAVE MADE AND FROM WHICH I HAVE COMPUTED THE VALUES OF A I HAVE ALMOST INVARIABLY FOUND THAT THE VALUES OF A DECREASE AS THOSE OF 0 FROM WHICH THEY ARE DEDUCED INCREASE IN 169 OBSERVA TIONS THERE ARE ONLY 14 EXCEPTIONS AND IN THESE IN GENERAL THE DIFFERENCES ARE SO SMALL THAT THEY MOST PROBABLY AROSE FROM SMALL ERRORS IN THE OBSERVATIONS IT WOULD APPEAR THEN THAT IN ALL THE EXPERIMENTS THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME CIRCUM STANCE WHICH HAS A TENDENCY TO DIMINISH THE VALUE OF A AS THAT OF 0 INCREASED IT AT FIRST OCCURRED TO ME THAT THIS MIGHT BE A SMALL DEVIATION FROM THE RECEIVED LAW IN THE CONNECTION BE TWEEN THE FORCE EXERTED BY THE WIRE AND ITS TORSION BUT THIS I FOUND WAS NOT THE CASE AS THE RESULTS WHICH I OBTAINED BY COMPARING THE DEVIATIONS OF A MAGNETIZED NEEDLE WITH THE TORSION OF THE WIRE WERE EXTREMELY UNIFORM IF THE FORCE 78THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C EXERTED BY THE WIRE BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE TORSION THE TORSION DIVIDED BY THE SINE OF THE DEVIATION SHOULD BE CONSTANT NOW THE VALUES WHICH I OBTAINED FOR THIS QUOTIENT WITH THE TORSIONS 71308 14275 214117 WERE 6600 6595 6634 THE GREATEST DIFFERENCE AMONG WHICH IS ONLY THE I65TH PART OF THE MEAN THE RESISTANCE OF THE AIR WOULD HAVE A TENDENCY TO INCREASE THE WHOLE TIME DURING WHICH THE DISC CONTINUED TO REVOLVE IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MAGNETS AND CONSEQUENTLY TO DIMINISH THE VALUES OF A AS THOSE OF 8 INCREASED BUT NOT TO A SUFFICIENT EX TENT A DIMINUTION OF 6 OR 7 SECONDS IN THE WHOLE TIME AND IN SOME INSTANCES MORE BEING REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF A NOR CAN THE DECREASE ARISE FROM THE SMALL CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE IN THE RELATIVE VELOCITY OF THE DISC AND THE MAGNETS UPON THE WHOLE I THINK IT VERY PROBABLE THAT THE VALUES OF A REALLY DECREASE IN THE SUCCESSIVE REVOLU TIONS OF THE DISC AND IN THIS MANNER ACCORDING TO THE PRIN CIPLE ADOPTED IN THE VERY INTERESTING PAPER BY MR HERSCHEL AND MR BABBAGE ON THE MAGNETISM MANIFESTED BY VARIOUS SUB STANCES DURING ROTATION AND SO WELL SUPPORTED BY ALL THE PHENO MENA HITHERTO OBSERVED THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETS UPON THE DISC WILL DEPEND UPON THE EXCESS OF THE MAGNETISM IN THOSE PARTS OF THE DISC IN THE REAR OF THE MAGNETS ABOVE THAT IN THE PARTS IN ADVANCE OF THEM AND IF THIS EXCESS WERE CONSTANT SO WOULD ALSO BE THE VALUE OF A  BUT IF ON THE MAGNETS COMING SUCCES SIVELY UNDER ANY POINT THAT POINT HAS NOT PARTED WITH ALL THE MAGNETISM WHICH IT IS CAPABLE OF LOSING BY THE REMOVAL OF THE MAGNETS TO THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE DISC THERE MAY BE A GRA DUAL THOUGH SMALL ACCUMULATION OF THE MAGNETISM LEFT IN EVERY POINT OF THE DISC AND AS ONLY A CERTAIN PORTION OF MAG NETISM CAN BE DEVELOPED IN EACH POINT DURING THE TIME THAT THE 79MR CHRISTIE ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF NETS ARE IN ITS VICINITY THE EXCESS WHICH WE HAVE MENTIONED WOULD BE THUS GRADUALLY DIMINISHED AND CONSEQUENTLY ALSO THE VALUE OF A THE FORCES WITH WHICH THE MAGNETS REVOLVING AT DIF FERENT DISTANCES WITH THE SAME ANGULAR VELOCITY URGED THE DISC ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE MEAN VALUES OF IN TABLE II AND TO DEDUCE THE RELATIVE FORCES WITH WHICH THE MAGNETS WOULD URGE THE DISC WHEN REVOLVING AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES WITH THE SAME LINEAR VELOCITY FOR INSTANCE THAT AT THE DISTANCE 42 INCHES THE VALUES OF A MUST BE INCREASED IN THE INVERSE RATIO OF THE RESPECTIVE DISTANCES SINCE THE FORCES CATERIS PARIBUS ARE PRO TIONAL TO THE VELOCITIES THIS REDUCTION IS MADE IN THE FOLP LOWING TABLE TABLE III ISTNE F TE A INCHES INCHES INCHES INCHES INCHES INCHES DISTANCE OF THE AXES OF 1 THE

APPEARS FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT THE IN TENSITY OF THE INDUCED MAGNETISM WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST HAD THE MAGNETS REVOLVED AT THE DISTANCE 2O7 INCHES NEARLY  THAT IS SO THAT THEIR AXES HAD BEEN AT THE DISTANCE OF HALF THE RADIUS OF THE DISC FROM THE CENTRE THIS IS WHAT WE MIGHT EXPECT WHATEVER MAY BE THE LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH MAGNETISM IS DEVELOPED IN EACH PARTICLE BUT THE GREAT DIMI NUTION IN THE INTENSITY WHEN THE MAGNETS REVOLVED UNDER THE EDGE OF THE DISC LEADS TO AN INFERENCE RESPECTING THE DEVE LOPEMENT OF MAGNETISM BY INDUCTION BY NO MEANS UNIM PORTANT VIZ THAT CONTINUITY IS MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL THAN MASS AND THAT ALTHOUGH A CERTAIN PORTION OF MAGNETISM IS DEVE LOPED IN EACH PARTICLE SEPARATELY YET THE WHOLE OF THIS IS CONSIDERABLY LESS THAN THAT WHICH APPEARS TO ACCUMULATE BY THE MUTUAL ACTION OF PARTICLE UPON PARTICLE FOR WHICH ACTION CONTINUITY APPEARS TO BE REQUISITE THE MEASURE OF THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN THE COPPER IF THE MAGNETS REVOLVED AT THE DISTANCE 21 INCHES

QUANTITY DEVELOPED ON EACH SIDE OF THE AXES OF THE MAGNETS THE MEASURE THEREFORE OF THE MAG NETISM DEVELOPED WHEN THE MAGNETS REVOLVED WITH THEIR AXES UNDER THE EDGE OF THE DISC IF CONTINUITY PRODUCED NO ACCUMU LATING EFFECT OUGHT CERTAINLY NOT TO BE LESS THAN 2091  BUT AS IT IS ACTUALLY ONLY 68O05 IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE CONTINUITY OF MASS ON EACH SIDE OF THE AXES OF THE MAGNETS HAS THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THE QUANTITY OF MAGNETISM DEVELOPED AT LEAST IN THE RATIO OF 3 TO I THE RESULTS WHICH I OBTAINED BY MAKING A CIRCULAR CUT IN THE DISC LEAD TO A SIMILAR CONCLUSION IN THIS CASE THE MAG NETS WERE AGAIN ADJUSTED TO THE DISTANCE 37 INCHES FROM THE AXIS OF ROTATION AND THE TIMES IN WHICH THE DISC COMPLETED SUCCESSIVE REVOLUTIONS WAS NOTED AS BEFORE A CIRCULAR CUT THROUGH THE DISC WAS NOW

FROM OBSERVA TIONS MADE WITH DIFFERENT DISCS IF THE AGREEMENT OF ALL THESE RESULTS WITH SO SIMPLE A LAW IS TO BE CONSIDERED AS FORTUITOUS THE COINCIDENCE IS CERTAINLY MOST SINGULAR BUT I AM DISPOSED TO THINK THAT THE LAW IN NATURE IS REALLY THIS THAT THE QUANTITIES OF MAGNETISM DESTROYED BY REMOVING CONCENTRIC PORTIONS FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE DISC ARE PROPORTIONAL TO THE MASS REMOVED BUT THAT THEY HAVE NOT GENERALLY THE SAME RATIO TO THE WHOLE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN THE UNCUT DISC WHICH THE PORTION REMOVED FROM THE DISC HAS TO THE WHOLE DISC THAT IS IF D IS THE DIAMETER OF THE UNCUT DISC AND A REPRESENT THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN IT D1 AND D THE DIAMETERS OF PORTIONS REMOVED AND   THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN THE DISC WHEN THOSE PORTIONS ARE REMOVED THE MAGNETS REVOLVING AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE AXIS IN EACH CASE THEN CCAOA DB A AND IS NOT EQUAL TO  BUT M Q   WHERE Q WILL BE CONSTANT SO LONG AS THE MAGNETS REVOLVE AT THE SAME DISTANCE FROM THE AXIS BUT WILL VARY WITH THAT DISTANCE IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE THE MAGNETS REVOLVING AT THE DISTANCE 3 2 INCHES FROM THE AXIS THE VALUES OF Q DERIVED FROM THE DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS ARE 148 145 1 53 154 GIVING A MEAN 15O HERE THEN THE MAGNETISM DESTROYED BY THE REMOVAL OF CONCENTRIC PORTIONS FROM THE INTERIOR OF THE DISC HAS A CONSIDERABLY GREATER RATIO TO THE WHOLE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED THAN THE MASS REMOVED HAS TO THE WHOLE FROM THE GREAT DIMINUTION IN THE INTENSITY OF THE INDUCED 88THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C MAGNETISM WHICH TAKES PLACE ON MAKING A CIRCULAR CUT IN THE DISC ESPECIALLY NEAR TO THE MAGNETS IT WOULD FOLLOW THAT IF A COPPER DISC WERE REDUCED TO A SERIES OF CONCENTRIC RINGS OF SMALL BREADTH THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN IT WOULD BE SCARCELY APPRECIABLE UNDER WHATEVER PART THE MAGNETS MIGHT REVOLVE THE SAME WOULD FOLLOW FROM THE EXPERIMENT OF MR BABBAGE AND MR IERSCHEL IF A COPPER DISC BY CONTI NUAL CUTTING IN THE DIRECTION OF RADII WERE REDUCED NEARLY TO A SERIES OF VERY SMALL SECTORS SO THAT IF A DISC WERE SEPARATED IN BOTH DIRECTIONS SO AS TO BE REDUCED TO PIECES OF SMALL MAGNITUDE EVEN THOUGH NOT IN A STATE OF POWDER THERE CAN I THINK BE NO DOUBT THAT THE INDUCED MAGNETISM WOULD BE RENDERED INSENSIBLE THE VALUE OF A TABLE VII WHEN THE DISC WAS CUT AS IN FIG 4 THE RINGS AND SMALL DISC BEING RETAINED IS RATHER LESS THAN ITS VALUE WHEN THEY WERE REMOVED THIS HOWEVER IS ONLY TO BE ATTRIBUTED

ENTIRE DISC 44 INCHES IN DIA METER IN THE RING INSTEAD OF THE SMALL DISC AND RINGS THE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE SOME TIME AFTER THE PRECEDING WHEN THE APPARATUS HAD BEEN MOVED AND THE DISC WAS NOT AT

MAGNETISM IS COMMUNICATED TO AND DISTRIBUTED IN RE VOLVING BODIES THESE RESULTS ARE IN PERFECT ACCORDANCE WITH THOSE WHICH I HAVE DEDUCED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WITH THE DISC I IT FOLLOWS THEN FROM THESE EXPERIMENTS THAT IN THE DE VELOPEMENT OF INDUCED MAGNETISM BY ROTATION EVERY PORTION OF A MASS CONTRIBUTES TOWARDS THE INTENSITY OF THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED AND THAT IN A MUCH GREATER RATIO THAN WOULD BY DIRECT INDUCTION BE DUE TO THAT PORTION ACCORDING TO ITS DISTANCE FROM THE MAGNET SO THAT THERE APPEARS TO BE AS IT WERE AN ACCUMULATION OF MAGNETISM ARISING FROM THE MUTUAL ACTION OF THE SEVERAL PARTICLES UPON EACH OTHER CONTINUITY THROUGHOUT HAS THUS A MUCH GREATER INFLUENCE THAN MASS A COMPLETE SOLUTION OF CONTINUITY WHEN IT DOES NOT TAKE PLACE IN THE PARTS ADJACENT TO THE MAGNET IS

THE MUTUAL ACTION OF ON THE LAW OF A OF THE VA MAGNETC FORCES GENERATED AT DFFERENT DISTANCES DURING ROTATION I HAVE ALREADY STATED THAT WITH THE VIEW OF DETERMINING THIS LAW FROM EXPERIMENT I MADE

PRINCIPLE THAT TIME IS REQUISITE BOTH FOR THE DEVELOPE MENT AND FOR THE DISSIPATION OF MAGNETISM THE INDUCED POLES IN THE RING WOULD ALWAYS BE IN THE REAR OF THE MAGNETS IT APPEARED PROBABLE THAT THE SUPPOSITION OF THE FORCE VARYING INVERSELY AS SOME POWER OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE POLE OF EACH MAGNET AND A POINT IN THE RING AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE IN THE REAR OF IT WOULD GIVE RESULTS

WHEN MAGNETS REVOLVED HORIZONTALLY UNDER A COPPER DISC THE FORCE WITH WHICH THEY URGED IT APPEARED TO VARY ACCORDING TO A LAW APPROXIMATING RATHER TOWARDS THAT OF THE INVERSE SQUARE OF THE DISTANCE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE LAW IN THE TWO CASES AROSE NO DOUBT FROM A LIGHT COPPER DISC HAVING BEEN SUS PENDED OVER STRONG BAR MAGNETS IN THE SECOND EXPERIMENT INSTEAD OF SUSPENDING THE HEAVY COPPER PLATE OVER THE NEEDLE USED IN THE FIRST EXPERIMENT WHICH COULD NOT HAVE BEEN CON VENIENTLY DONE AS ITS WEIGHT IS ABOUT 16LBS BUT WHICH WOULD HAVE REVERSED THE EXPERIMENT TO REMOVE ANY DOUBT THAT MIGHT ARISE FROM THIS APPARENT INCONGRUITY I DETERMINED NOW PRECISELY TO REVERSE THE EXPERIMENT IN THE TWO CASES MAKING THE COPPER RING REVOLVE UNDER THE SAME MAGNETS OVER WHICH IT HAD BEEN BEFORE SUSPENDED AS HOWEVER I COULD NOT SUSPEND THE MAGNETS VERTICALLY OVER THE RING WITHOUT INCREASING SO CONSIDERABLY THE WEIGHT TO BE SUSPENDED BY THE APPARATUS TO FIX THEM IN THAT THE WIRE BY WHICH THE RING HAD BEEN SUSPENDED WOULD NO LONGER SUSTAIN THEM AND  PHIL TRANS 1 85 101MR CHRISTIE ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF INDEED THAT NO WIRE ON THE TORSION OF WHICH ANY SENSIBLE EFFECT COULD BE PRODUCED WOULD DO SO THE PRECEDING EXPERI MENTS COULD NOT BE MADE USE OF AS STRICTLY COMPARATIVE WITH OTHERS IN WHICH THE RING SHOULD REVOLVE UNDER THE MAG NETS IT THEREFORE BECAME NECESSARY TO MAKE A DIFFERENT ADJUSTMENT OF

BEING LOWERED UNTIL ITS UNDER SURFACE JUST TOUCHED WITH OUT RESTING UPON TWO BRASS NUTS FIXING THE MAGNETS TO THE FRAME THE DISTANCE BETWEEN K AND M WAS ASCERTAINED TO BE 9575 INCHES SO THAT THE

REPRESENT THE EFFECTS THAT ARE PRODUCED WHETHER BY THE ROTATION OF MAGNETS ON A COPPER RING OR ON MAGNETS BY THE ROTATION OF A RING WITHIN CERTAIN LIMITS OF THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE MAGNETS AND THE RING HAVING SUCCEEDED IN DETERMINING FROM EXPERIMENT THE LAW ACCORDING TO WHICH THE FORCES ACTING DURING ROTATION VARIED AT DIFFERENT DISTANCES FOR WHICH PURPOSE PRINCIPALLY I HAD UNDER TAKEN THESE EXPERIMENTS MY NEXT OBJECT WAS TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER THE FORMULA I HAD OBTAINED WOULD RESULT FROM THE PRINCIPLE THAT TIME IS NECESSARY BOTH FOR THE DEVELOPEMENT OF MAGNETISM BY INDUCTION AND FOR ITS DISSIPATION AND WHICH APPEARED TO BE IMPLIED IN THE FORMULA 1 1THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C WE HAVE AS YET NO FACTS WHICH INDICATE ON WHAT FUNCTION OF THE TIME EITHER THE DEVELOPEMENT OR DISSIPATION OF MAG NETISM DEPENDS AND UNTIL THIS CAN BE ASCERTAINED THERE APPEARS LITTLE PROSPECT OF OBTAINING A COMPLETE SOLUTION TO THIS INTERESTING BUT INTRICATE PROBLEM IN MAGNETISM IT APPEARED TO ME NOT IMPROBABLE THAT WHEN THE DISTANCE OF A MAGNETIC POLE FROM A BODY CAPABLE OF BECOMING MAGNETIC BY INDUCTION IS SUDDENLY DECREASED THE MAGNETISM DEVELOPED IN ANY VERY SMALL PORTION OF TIME VARIES AS THE TIME AND THE MAGNETISM YET REMAINING TO BE DEVELOPED BEFORE IT HAS ATTAINED THE MAXIMUM INTENSITY OF WHICH IT IS SUSCEPTIBLE AT THIS DIMI NISHED DISTANCE AND WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE INTENSITY DUE TO THIS DISTANCE AND THAT ON THE CONTRARY ON THE REMOVAL OF THE POLE THE MAGNETISM DISSIPATED VARIES AS THE TIME AND THE EXCESS OF THE INTENSITY ABOVE THE MINIMUM AT THE INCREASED DISTANCE THE RATE OF DEVELOPEMENT AND DISSIPATION NOT BEING HOWEVER CATERIS PARIBUS NECESSARILY THE SAME I ACCORDINGLY ASSUMED THIS IN ORDER TO OBTAIN THE INTENSITY OF THE MAG NETISM IN ANY POINT OF THE RING IN TERMS OF ITS DISTANCE FROM THE POLE OF THE MAGNET BUT ALTHOUGH THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUA TION THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THIS ASSUMPTION IS INTEGRABLE SO THAT THE INTENSITY OF THE POINT MAY BE DETERMINED YET AS IT IS IN A SERIES WHOSE CONVERGENCY DEPENDS UPON THE SMALLNESS OF THE ANGULAR DISTANCE BETWEEN THAT POINT AND THE POINT VERTICALLY OVER THE POLE OF THE MAGNET AND A SECOND INTE GRATION IS REQUIRED TO DEDUCE THE FORCE WITH WHICH THE MAG NETS URGE THE RING THE RESULT IS RENDERED SO COMPLICATED THAT TO REDUCE IT TO ANY FORM WITH WHICH THE FORMULA I HAVE OBTAINED FROM EXPERIMENT MAY BE COMPARED APPEARS ALMOST A HOPELESS TASK I CONSIDER THEREFORE THAT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN MDCCCXXVII Q 113MR CHRISTIE ON THE MUTUAL ACTION OF THEORETICAL RESULTS IT IS BETTER TO ADOPT IN A MORE GENERAL WAY THE PRINCIPLE TO WHICH I HAVE REFERRED ACCORDING TO THIS PRINCIPLE THE MAGNETISM IN THE RING WILL NOT BE DEVELOPED WITH THE GREATEST INTENSITY IN THE POINT WHICH IS VERTICAL TO THE POLE OF THE MAGNET AT ANY INSTANT BUT IN A POINT AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE BEHIND IT AND IN EVERY POINT IN ADVANCE OF THIS AND LIKEWISE IN THOSE BEHIND MAGNETISM WILL BE DEVELOPED WITH AN INTENSITY DEPENDING UPON THEIR DISTANCES FROM THE POLE OF THE MAGNET IN THE POINTS BEHIND THE INTENSITY WILL BE GREATER THAN WHAT I HAVE TERMED THE INTEN SITY DUE TO THE DISTANCE OF THE MAGNET IN THOSE IN ADVANCE LESS BUT THE SAME DISTRIBUTION OF MAGNETISM IN THE RING WILL CONSTANTLY FOLLOW THE MAGNET DURING ITS ROTATION UNDER IT WITH THE SAME UNIFORM VELOCITY THE EFFECT OF THE MAGNETISM IN THE POINTS BEHIND THE POLE OF THE MAGNET WILL BE TO URGE THE RING WITH A CONSTANT FORCE IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION THAT OF THE MAGNETISM IN THOSE IN ADVANCE TO URGE IT IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION LIKEWISE WITH A CONSTANT FORCE SO THAT THE RING WILL BE URGED IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION WITH A FORCE WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE EXCESS OF THE FORMER FORCE ABOVE THE LATTER WE MAY THEREFORE ASSUME THAT THE WHOLE FORCE OF THE PARTS OF THE RING IN ADVANCE OF THE MAGNET WILL BE DESTROYED BY THE FORCE OF ONLY A PORTION OF THE PART BEHIND AND THAT THE RING IS CONTINUALLY URGED IN THE DIRECTION OF ROTATION BY THE UNDIMINISHED FORCE OF THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE PART BEHIND SO THAT TO OBTAIN THE FORCE OF THE WHOLE WE SHALL HAVE TO INTEGRATE FROM ONE EXTREMITY OF THIS PORTION TO THE OTHER LET R BE THE RADIUS OF THE CIRCLE DESCRIBED BY

THIS VALUE MAY BE SO CONSIDERABLY INCREASED THAT THE FIRST TERM WILL NO LONGER GIVE AN APPROXI MATE VALUE OF THE FORCE BEYOND A CERTAIN VELOCITY THE VALUE OF 4 MAY INCREASE WITH THE VELOCITY AND WE MAY EVEN CON CEIVE THE VELOCITY TO BE SO FAR INCREASED THAT 4 BECOMING  R LL 8ITHEPARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C THE EXPRESSION FOR THE FORCE WILL BECOME EQUAL TO O AND WITH A STILL FARTHER INCREASE

OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE W BEING EXTREMELY SMALL ANDI A ABOUT 4 WE MAY WITHOUT ANY SEN SIBLE ERROR OMIT THE SECOND AND FOLLOWING TERMS IN THE EXPRESSION FOR THE FORCE WHICH IS THUS REDUCED TO THE FORM WHICH REPRESENTS VERY ACCURATELY THE SEVERAL VALUES OF A WHICH IS THE MEASURE OF THAT FORCE IN THE EXPERIMENTS I AM AWARE THAT IT MAY BE OBJECTED TO THE METHOD OF INVES TIGATION WHICH I HAVE ADOPTED THAT THE VALUE OF 4 MAY NOT BE CONSTANT FOR DIFFERENT VALUES OF D NOR THAT OF W BE CONSTANT FOR EVERY POINT OF THE RING BEHIND THE PORTION R 4 EVEN FOR THE SAME VALUE OF C BUT THE VARIATIONS OF THESE BEING EVI DENTLY WITHIN VERY NARROW LIMITS NO SENSIBLE ERROR CAN ARISE FROM SUPPOSING THEM CONSTANT THE PERFECT COINCIDENCE BETWEEN THE FORMULA DEDUCED ON THIS SUPPOSITION AND THAT PREVIOUSLY OBTAINED FROM THE EXPERIMENTS PROVES CLEARLY THAT THIS IS THE CASE AND THAT THE ASSUMPTIONS WHICH I HAVE MADE ARE PERFECTLY ADMISSIBLE AFTER THE VERY SATISFACTORY EXPLANATION WHICH MR BABBAGE AND MR HERSCHEL HAVE GIVEN OF THE GENERAL PHAENOMENA OBSERVED DURING ROTATION ON THE PRINCIPLE THAT TIME IS REQUI SITE BOTH FOR THE DEVELOPEMENT AND FOR THE DISSIPATION OF MAGNETISM FULLY TO ESTABLISH THE TRUTH OF THE PRINCIPLE IT REMAINED ONLY TO SHOW THAT THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM PHIL TRANS FOR I825THE PARTICLES OF MAGNETIC BODIES C 1 2 CALCULATION FOUNDED ON THAT PRINCIPLE PERFECTLY ACCORD WITH THOSE OBTAINED FROM EXPERIMENT AND THIS I TRUST I HAVE DONE BY THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL DETAILS CONSIDERING THIS THEN AS AN ESTABLISHED PRINCIPLE FUTURE IN VESTIGATIONS MUST BE DIRECTED TO THE DISCOVERY OF THE FUNCTION OF THE TIME ON WHICH THE INTENSITY OF THE INDUCED MAGNETISM DEPENDS DURING THE APPROACH OF A MAGNETIC POLE TOWARDS A PHYSICAL POINT SUSCEPTIBLE OF MAGNETISM AND ALSO DURING ITS RECESS I HAVE STATED WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE NOT AN IMPRO BABLE LAW BUT THE WHOLE TIME OCCUPIED EITHER IN THE DEVE LOPEMENT OF MAGNETISM BY INDUCTION OR IN ITS DISSIPATION IS SO MINUTE THAT IT APPEARS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DEVISE EXPE RIMENTS THAT WOULD BE A DIRECT TEST OF SUCH LAWS AND TO THE MORE INDIRECT TESTS DERIVED FROM A COMPARISON OF SUCH EXPE RIMENTAL RESULTS AS THE FOREGOING WITH THEORETICAL RESULTS DERIVED FROM THESE LAWS DIFFICULTIES OF ANALYSIS IN GENERAL OPPOSE THEMSELVES ROYAL MILITARY ACADEMY 7TH JUNE I826 MDCCCXXVII R

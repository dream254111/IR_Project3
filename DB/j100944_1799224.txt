Square Jan 191860 At a time when such efforts are being made to open out the interior of Afriea to the benefits of legal commerce and civilization it hasFeb 27 1860 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO 67 occurred to me that the Congo river is well worthy the attention of the Eoyal Geographical Society In the first place in addition to its being so much nearer Eng land than the Zambesi within a month by steamer the dangers ofthe Cape of Good Hope and the Mozambique Channel are also avoided It has no bar having 150 fathoms water at its mouth It is navigable for seagoing ships nearly 100 miles either under sail or steamer I myself took HMS Pluto drawing 9 feet to Embomma and back with very little trouble HMS Antelope and Mednsa have also ascended as far as Punto de Lenha the latter vessel drawing 12 feet in the month of August when the river is at its lowest Should the trade ever be developed it is within reach of the West African packets and I also hear a Portuguese line is now established to Loanda touching the islands of St Thomas and Princes  provisions are abundant and cheap natives friendly and I believe with very little encouragement they might be induced to cultivate groundnuts of which considerable quan tities are even now exported or anything else likely to pay to a much larger extent than they do at present They could also collect palmoil copper ore ivory gum and beeswax Cotton grows every where as on the east coasts  there is also lignum vitge above the rapids At Punto de Lenha about 30 miles above Shark Point there are numerous factories and room for more if the bush were cleared away vessels here lie in deep water alongside the wharves for loading and unloading it is tolerably healthy and a few miles above this point the mangrove ends and high land com mences The factors here state that the wild cotton growing in abundance is of good quality and easily separated from the seed it produces two crops a year I should mention that at Loanda only 200 miles south of this cotton is exported and its cultivation en couraged by the present governor They also state that the islands in this part of the river some of them of considerable size are well suited for its cultivation The village of Embomma is situated on a hill and is admirably adapted for a trading settlement there are also several factories of the Portuguese a large market is held here once a week and it is the central depot for slaves The French have established there factories on a large scale for the emigration scheme at the mouth of the river opposite Shark Point and they were to have had a small steamer to ply between Tench Point and Embomma to bring down the socalled emigrants The country round Embomma is the granary for the slave fac tories along the country and the coast to the north of the river it68 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO Feb 27 1860 produces corn farinha beaus and almost every European vegetable in abundance and Lieut J W Pike rn saw at one of the Portuguese factories a vine bearing excellent grapes That gentleman is lately returned from the Congo and I am indebted to him for much in formation respecting the present state of the river I believe there has been no attempt to explore this river above the rapids since that of Captain Tuckey in 1815 the sickness and mortality in this expedition at first sight seem alarming and may have been partly the reason why no effort bas since been made A careful perusal of Professor Smiths Journal who accompanied Captain Tuckey will however show good cause why it should not be so The treatment of African fever was at that time little known bloodletting and calomel to salivation seem to have been resorted to Free use of palmwine liberty to run about amongst the swamps or sleep in the dews at night or in the negro huts with excesses in another way sure to tell in an African climate together with overfatigue will readily account for the great mortality I believe the Congo to be as healthy as any other river in Africa and the peculiar dryness of the atmosphere mentioned by Professor Smith would make it likely to be more so This expedition seems to have arrived in the river at the very worst time for exploring viz when it was at its very lowest and they were consequently obliged to travel by land and endure much more fatigue than would otherwise have been the case At that time they estimatedthe largest rapid that of Yallata to be a fall of 30 feet in 300 yards 17 days later the river had risen 7 feet with no perceptible difference in the eurrent the rise in the wet season seems to be in the narrows between 12 and 15 feet but at Punto de Lenha it is only 5 or 6 feet We are led to believe that the Congo flows througb a very rich country capable of the highest cultivation with abundance of water independent of the river itself Professor Smith thus speaks of it at the point at which they were obliged to turn baek owing to the sickness of their party  We are at the beginning of a country evidently capable of extensive cultivation witb a fine navigable river abundance of provisions for sale and an increased population Captain Tuckey also speaking of the river a little lower down but above the rapids says It is a magnificent river three miles wide with the most beautiful scenery equal to anything on the banks of the Thames The Zambesi for many reasons will never prove a good outlet for the produce of the interior for it is not navigable for seagoingFeb 27 1860 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO 69 ships and it is I fear a fact that the Portuguese will throw great difficulties in the way of trade  at present they do not allow foreign merchants to go above Quillimane and the duties there are enormous We should therefore I think look for another river open to free trade and such the Congo offers to us The immense body of water flowing from it all the year round the rich tract of country through which it must pass the probability that it would lead us near some of the longdisputed snowcapped mountains and the little information we have of that part of Afriea make it I conceive worthy the consideration of the Society if an expedition could not be sent out at small expense to ascertain in the first place if the river is navigable for 600 miles above the rapids as reported by the slavetraders and if so whether an easy path could not be found from Embomma to a spot above the rapids mentioned by Captain Tuckey as admirably adapted as a station for the further exploration of the river I firmly believe this could be done and also that canoes of a certain construction might without much difficulty be taken above the rapids for the purpose Commanders Hunt and Moresby ascended the river in their boats as far as the first rapid in January 1857 They had not much difficulty for although they estimated the distance to be 130 miles they were only six days going and returning they describe the weather as so delightfully cool that they could dispense with awnings in the daytime They had no sickness whatever Should an expedition be sent out it would of course require mature consideration as to the best plan of proceeding I should propose a small schooner yacht that would carry out in addition to provisions and presents necessary a small cargo for the purpose of trade as you would thereby encourage the natives and at the same time by bringing home a return cargo considerably lessen the ex pense of the expedition Two canoes in sections of the same material as our steamlaunch in the Zambesi was constructed should be sent in her each section light enough for four men to carry overland at parts of the river it might be found dangerous to drag them through Crews for them might be hired  the Katenda men are excellent boatmen very similar to our Kroomen  the pay should be made to depend upon their conduct during the trip The schooner should not ascend above Embomma and I apprehend there could be little difficulty in keeping up communication with her and thus to Fernando Po and to England by the African packets An expedition should arrive in the river about the end of Sep70 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO Feb 27 1860 tember so that there is ample time should it be deemed a subject worthy of consideration Mr J J Monteiro saidI have heard with great pleasure Captain Eedingfelds proposition for an expedition to the River Congo I consider this proposition as a most important one in many respects and which if carried out will be productive of the greatest benerlts to Africa and to commerce It will be the means of obtaining correct and reliable informa tion on questions of the utmost importance and at present very prominently attracting attention I allude more particularly to the suppression of the slave trade and to the magnificent capabilities of the whole of Angola for the production on any scale of cotton of the finest quality That the hot damp climate of Angola is essentially suited to the cultivation of cotton is evident from its growing luxuriantly on soils and under circumstances of very great variety I have seen it growing abundantly though not with equal facility perhaps on the stony soil of the mica and quartz rock and on that of the mica schist and clay slate from Ambriz to Bembe as well as on the cal careous tufa and trap rocks of the country traversed by Livingstone and on which I have travelled as far as the farthest limits of the province of Cam bambe and within a days journey of Pungo Andongo In thee parts it is produced in great abundance and the blacks are everywhere seen spinning it as described by Livingstone I saw it also growing abundantly on the banks of the Eiver Quanga down which I returned to the coast from above the im portant  quitanda  or fair of Dondo From these circumstances we may be certain that the rich banks of the Congo must also be eminently suitable to the cultivation of cotton From my knowledge of the  Mussurongos and other negroes of that locality I do not I am sorry to say anticipate any commercial advantages soon to result from this expedition but I do anticipate most important and valuable results from its observations on that hotbed of the slave trade This expedition will inform you how the negroes of that country love the slave trade above all others and how perfectly impossible it is to induce them to eultivate cotton groundnuts or other produce so long as the traffic in slaves exists and how impossible it is to abolish this horrid traffic in human flesh and blood without a firm occupation of the principal points on that river and coast and that then only can commercial enterprise with any safety be established and civilization or Christianity be introduced amongst the scoundrelly negroes that at present unfortunately occupy that fine coast As my contribution towards the realization of this expedition I beg to offer you a few suggestions the result of nearly two years experience at Ambriz and Bembe a couple of degrees to the south of the Congo In the first place the expedition should arrive at the river from the middle to the end of May and not later if possible  that is to say immediately after the rainy season September as proposed by Captain Bedingfeld would be the very worst time to arrive at the coast the rainy season commencing about October and ending as I have said about the middle of May This is subject of course to slight variations but from May to October may be safely taken as the dry season Again in September all the rivers on that coast are at their lowest level and the rainy season then about to commence is the unhealthiest for Europeans though the best for the blacks on account of the terrific heat The dry season is cool excessively damp misty and comparatively sunless particularly towards the higher interior country The rivers in May are of course full  and though the eurrent may be stronger it is better than having to rot anywhere on the banks of the river as it is not possible to travel during the rainy season I do not say it could not be done as I have myself travelled during the rainy season and I do not believe one constitution in a hundredFeb 27 1860 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO 71 could do it A very great preservative of health on that coast is to keep con stantly moving or at work any cessation of labour or travelling is soon attended with attacks of fever Flannel next the skin is considered abso lutely necessary on the coast over it we found a loose dress of blue baize very useful against the dampness and coolness of the dry season For ascending the river there is no necessity whatever for a yacht schooner or anything of the kind On the Coast or at Punto de Lenha where the Por tuguese English and American factories are established alanchaor a  palhabote  could easily he hired and the best possible conveyance to the rapids above Beyond that I do not believe anything better for exploring can he employed than the large native canoes Not the least opposition to the expedition need he apprehended from the Portuguese slave traders on the contrary I think they would he very glad that a party of Englishmen should risk their lives and money to open a road into the interior and induce the natives to bring down their produce in the expectation of an increased and cheaper supply of slaves and because they well know how innocent to their horrid interests are the efforts of Englishmen who with a great flourish of representing the power and majesty of England attempt singlehanded to put down this detestable traffic on immense coasts where the natives are the greatest slavedealers enabling them as they say to he rich without working and always as drunk as they please and who call on the weak and powerless authorities to do that which a whole British squadron is unahle to effect Archdeacon Mackenzie said of the two communications which had been read the one relating to the Congo was the more interesting to himself That river possessing as it did a better mouth and a better harbour than any other river south of the Equator in Afriea certainly seemed to offer a great opening into the interior But instead of giving up the Zambesi mission as the paper recommended he would suggest another mission to the country of the Congo as well He did not see how they could interfere with each other for they would be far apart there being a distance of two thousand miles aeross from sea to sea Mr Crawfurd frgs called attention to the improvement which had been effected in the breed of sheep and in the quality of wool produced at the Cape through the exertions of Sir George Grey and then expressed his concurrence in the views of Captain Bedingfeld respecting the superiority of the Congo over the Zambesi as a commercial route into the interior of Afriea Captain Bedingfeld had seen both rivers and ought to be a better judge of their re spective capabilities than persons at home or those who had seen but one of them The Zambesi was not really commercially speaking a navigable river at all while the Congo certainly was What Captain Bedingfeld said about cotton might be set aside for it was idle to suppose that savages would ever cultivate it so as to render it valuable for commercial purposes Such had never happened But there were many things they could produce and among them was the groundnut which produced an excellent oil Still more important was the palm from which we obtained the now wTellknown palm oil This oil was more valuable than oliveoil itself and we imported 20000 tons of it in 1858 of the value of one and a half million sterling The culti vation of this palmthe Elais Guiniensis of botanistshas done more towards the suppression of slavery than all the navies of France England and America put together for the slavetrade had already actually ceased where the trade in palmoil was most active Other reasons why he thought the Congo superior to the Zambesi for the operations of Englishmen were that the West Coast of Afriea was more fertile and the natives were more civilised than on the east coast while the distance was not above one half from our own shores VOL IV G72 BEDINGFELD ON THE CONGO Feb 27 1860 Mr Macqueen frgs shortly observed that the river Okovango men tioned by Mr Andersson is the river named by the Portuguese the Cubango and is the parent stream of the Chobe which passes Linyanti to the Leambaye Mr Andersson must have struck the Okuvango in about 17 30 s lat and 19 20 e long from which point will be as he says twenty days journey northwest to its source in the high lands southwest of Bihe The watershed between the Atlantic and the Northern Ocean is in about 18 40 e long The country to the south of the middle Cubango is very woody and during the wet season a great volume of water runs eastward to the Tiogbe which river communicates with the Cubango or Chobe in Libebe There is no river in those parts called Embarah This name is a corruption of the word Aunbire the name of a chief who resides on the Upper Cubango With regard to the Congo it is for a very considerable part of its lower course impracticable for naviga tion by reason of cataracts and fearful rapids that no vessel could venture to stand These commence at about 110 geog miles from its mouth and over a distance of about 120 miles up the river which in this instance rushes through a rocky ridge of no great height everywhere consisting of very barren land Where Tuckey left the river in 3 40 s lat and 15 30 e long the river was 3 miles broad 3J fathoms deep with a eurrent of 3 miles an hour on the 4th of September just at the very time when the river was beginning slowly to swell from the rains a proof be it observed that its extreme source lies at a considerable distance on the northern Torrid Zone in about 9 30 N lat and where we find from some authorities it really is and not far from Nunga The mighty stream above mentioned is at one place nearly in the centre of the rapids confined within 25 yards in breadth between towering rocks which form its borders Here it is evident the eurrent must be as it really is terrific How far the river is smooth and navigable above the point where Tuckey left it is doubtful but it is almost certain that in its more distant parts towards its source the stream like all other African rivers in those parts runs over rapids and cataracts Branches of the Upper Congo descend westward and southwestwTard of the high lands which give birth to the western affluents of the White Nile especially one large branch flowing near the Equator An abstract of a remarkable journey or rather of repeated journeys by an American gentleman from the missionary station near the mouth of the Gaboon to a great distance into the interior has lately come in my way He explored the country lying between 4 s lat and 4 to 5 n lat and to a great distance into the interior It is all very woody but in many places level plains and to the north he says it is bounded by the range of the Crystal Mountains a continuation of the very high land extending eastwards from the high peak of the Cameroons When the full accounts of these journeys arrive they will be found to be exceedingly interesting The travels extended over several thousand miles The river Oggawai marked on my map of Africa has a long course from the interior above 350 miles It enters the sea at Cape Lopez by several mouths A French traveller had penetrated above 300 miles into the interior in this quarter of Africa A French ship had been up the river just mentioned 180 miles From this quarter of Africa is probably the best course to take to reach the Upper Congo The interior could be reached by land on the south side of the Congo and through a fine healthy country but this for the present may be considered impracticable because a formidable rebellion has lately broken out against the Portuguese authority at St Salvador the capital of the kingdom of Congo Against this place all the Portuguese forces in Angola naval and military were at the date of the latest accounts collecting and marching Till strife is settled travelling in those parts of Africa will be unsafe and dangerous

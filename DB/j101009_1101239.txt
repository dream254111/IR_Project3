Appeals At Richmond November 20 1902 1 LIBEL  Privileged communications Bona fides of publication  Case at bar Whether the occasion for the publication of defamatory matter is privileged is a question of law for the court but whether it has been used bona fide is a question of fact for the jury In the case at bar an officer of the defendant company after full investigation and inquiry as to alleged misconduct of the plaintiff an employee of the company and fully satisfying himself of the truth of the allegations dismissed him from the service of the company and published the following order  A fireman has been dismissed from the service for intimating that an officer of the company had cast reflections  Reported by M P Burks State Reporter1902 BROWN V N  W RY CO 575 upon the ancestry of another officer which was proved to be untrue There was no extrinsic evidence tending to show malice on the part of the company or any of its officers or agents and the conclusion of the officer making the investigation is in accordapce with the weight of the evidence Held The communication is privileged was made in good faith and hence is not actionable 2 LIBEL Privileged communicationsMalicePresumptionDemurrer to evidence If the communication is privileged the presumption is that there was no malice in its publication and the burden is upon the plaintiff to prove malice Where the truth or falsity of the statement is no wise involved but only the question of good faith in its publication malice will not be pre sumed even on a demurrer to the evidence by the defendant Error to a judgment of the Circuit Court of Pulaski county ren dered March 23 1900 in an action of trespass on the case in Libel wherein the plaintiff in error was the plaintiff and the defendaht in error was the defendant Affirmed The opinion states the case J C Wysor and D S Pollock for the plaintiff in error A A Phlegar and Jos I Doran for the defendant in error KEITH P delivered the opinion of the court Plaintiff in error Brown had been a fireman in the employment of the N  W Railway Company for several years and was well esteemed In July 1898 he was directed to take an engine from Radford to Bluefield to be used in drawing an excursion traina This engine had been standing in the roundhouse at Radford without protection and was in a rusty and filthy condition Brown endeavored as he states to clean it by the use of oil and waste cotton but was unable to do so When the engine arrived at Roanoke its condition was reported to ilenretta the road foreman of engines who summoned Brown before him Brown reported to Henretta in obedience to the summons and stated to him that he had done his best with the means at his disposal and thereupon as Brown alleges Henretta used the following language New man meaning S D Newman a master mechanic in the employ ment of the railway coinpany the damn son of a bitch is the cause of all this trouble he ought to have had that engine jacket lyedoff meaning that he ought to have had it washed with lye in order to remove the rust and filth Brown repeated the remark576 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER rDec which Henretta was alleged to have made in the presence of several other employees of the railway company and it was finally com municated to Newman Thereupon Newman called upon Brown with reference to it and Brown gave him a written statement of the occurrence as above narrated When Newman shortly there after met Henretta he asked him about this statement and Hen retta denied it and asked him to get a written statement from Brown and send it to him which was done Henretta also got a statement from Dickerson who was present at the interview be tween Brown and himself and then wrote to Pearce division mas ter mechanic the following letter  The attached papers are selfexplaining I have only to state that fireman EI M Brown has told a deliberate lie Mr Dickerson was witness to all my remarks when I was investigating fireman Browns neglect to properly clean engine 706 His statement is attached The papers are handed you that proper discipline may be applied Yours truly F B HENRETTA Pearce looked into the matter and reported the result of his enquiry in the following letter to W H Lewis superintendent of motive power  Further concerning the case of engine No 706 which you will remember came out on an excursion train in a very dirty condition fireman claiming he worked two hours cleaning the engine and engineman stating that he put ten minutes on it Please note attached from which it appears that Fireman Brown tried to get even by intimating that Mr Henretta had cast reflections on the female ancestry of Mr Newman and lied about the matter I think under cir cumstances that Mr Browns services should be dispensed with without further consideration J S PEARCE D M M W H Lewis as a result of his investigation published the fol lowing order  A fireman has been dismissed from the service for intimating that an officer of the company had cast reflections upon the ancestry of another officer which was proved to be untrue For the publication of this order the Norfolk  Western Railway Company was sued the jury rendering a verdict against the de fendant for 5000 subject to the judgment of the court upon its demurrer to the evidence the court entered judgment for the de fendant and the case is before us upon a writ of error awarded upon the petition of the plaintiff Brown1902 BROWN V N  W RY CO 577 The contention of the railway company is that the order issued by Lewis discharging Brown from the service of the company and assigning the reason for his action was a privileged communication for which the defendant in error is not liable in damages unless the publication was malicious that the company acted in good faith after due investigation and was inspired by no other motive than a desire to promote the efficiency of its service and to give necessary information to its employees In Chaffin v Lynch 83 Va 106 it was held that to justify pub lication of defamatory matter the occasion must be privileged and must be used bona fide without malice Whether the occasion be privileged is a question of law for the court Whether it has been used bona fide is a question of fact for the jury We think it plain that the communication which is the subject of controversy here was privileged Brown had made a statement with reference to what was said by his superior officer who was enquiring into the manner in which his duty had been discharged He reported that Henretta had at that interview used language in the highest degree insulting to Newman a coemployee Henretta denied the truth of the statement It was enquired into in a due and orderly course of investigation and the conclusion reached that Browns version of the affair was untrue Assuming for the moment that it was untrue it cannot be doubted that Brown was guilty of a very grave offence tending to produce illwill discord and strife among the employees of the company If such were the case it was altogether proper to discharge him from the service and due to him and all concerned that the reason for his discharge should be given so as to fix the blame where it belonged and to exonerate those who were innocent As was said by Judge Lewis in Chaffin v Lynch supra The reported cases on the subject of privileged communications are very numerous and they show that while the law as to such com mnunications is well settled its application to particular cases is often attended with difficulty They also show that the law in this particular was formerly more restricted than at present the rule having been gradually extended on the ground that it is to the interest of society that correct information should be obtained as to the character and standing of persons with whom others have business or social relations so that it is now settled as laid down by Baron Parke in the leading case of Toogood v Spyring 1 C M578 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec  R 181 that a communication honestly made in the performance of a social duty is no less privileged than one made in selfdefence or in the protection of ones own interest And a communication made under such circumstances and without malice is protected notwithstanding its imputations be false or founded upon the most erroneous information Did the defendant company act in good faith in making the publication complained of or was its action inspired by malice The question is not as to the truth or falsity of the publication It is solely a question of good faith on the one hand and of malice on the other In the interview between Henretta and Brown at which the language with reference to Newman is said to have been used there were present in addition to these gentlemen Dickerson and Stauffer Brown of course swears that his account of the in terview is the correct one Henretta denies that it is true and says that the language which he used was that it was a damn shame for Newman to let the engine come out in that fix Stauffer says that he was in the room when Brown was being questioned not more than five or six feet distant and that he did not hear the expression attributed by Brown to Henretta Dickerson says that he was present at the interview in Henrettas office when Brown was called in that he was not paying very much attention to what passed that although he was within a few feet of them he did not hear ienretta make use of the expression imputed to him by Brown that he twice heard him say once at the office and just be fore that when examining the engine that it was a damn shame that this engine was allowed to come out of the roundhouse in such condition We are aware that this case is before us upon a demurrer to the evidence but we repeat that the question here is not as to the truth or falsity of any statement made in the published order but merely as to the motive and intent by which the railway company was in spired The communication being privileged plaintiff in error can only prevail by showing that the defendant availed itself of the occasion not for the purpose of protecting its interests but to gratify its illwill ITpon this issue the burden of proof is upon the plaintiff in error The remarks of Judge Lewis in Strode v Clement 90 Va 553 are applicable in this case There is no extrinsic evidence of malice such as an antecedent grudge or previous disputes or any1902 BROWN V N  W RY CO 579 thing of that sort between the parties but the contention is that the language used by the defendant is of itself evidence of malice Undoubtedly strong or violent language disproportioned to the occasion may raise an inference of malice and thus lose the privi lege that otherwise would attach to it But when the occasion is privileged the tendency of the courts is not to submit the words to a too strict scrutiny but rather to view them in the light of the facts as they appeared to the defendant for the question is not whether the imputations are true but whether the words are such as the defendant might have honestly employed under the circum stances In this case there is no extrinsic evidence of malice nor is the language complained of so violent or disproportioned to the occa sion as to raise an inference of malice In other words there is no evidence of malice If the issue before the jury had been as to the truth of Browns account of what passed between Henretta and himself the evidence would have required a verdict establishing as true Henrettas version though a verdict in favor of the truth of Browns statement could not with propriety have been disturbed by the court Tyree v Harrison 42 S E R 245but the fact that the publication complained of was only made after the con troversy between Brown and ilenretta had been investigated and that it embodies the result of that enquiry in accordance with the weight of evidence clothed in temperate and decorous language in the absence of any extrinsic fact or circumstance having such tendency leaves the case stripped of any evidence to support the charge of malice and the presumption that the publication was made in good faith nust Prevail In Tyree v Harrison supra the jury rendered a verdict for the plaintiff in an action for libel The court set aside that verdict and at a subsequent trial rendered judgment for the defendant Thereupon the plaintiff obtained a writ of error to this court which reversed the case and entered judgment for the plaintiff upon the first verdict It was there held that it was for the jury to say which account was true that given by Tyree or that given by liar rison that the jury in the exercise of their function had seen fit to accept as true the statement of Tyree and that according to his account the language used was so strong violent and abusive as to warrant an inference of malice and destroy the privilege that would otherwise attach to the communication or at the least that this580 8 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER Dec court was unable to say that the verdict of the jury was so plainly against the weight of evidence as to justify the interference of the court In the case under consideration we are not called upon to con sider the weight or preponderance of evidence There is no ex trinsic evidence of malice and the language of the communication of which complaint is made and the manner of its publication do not justify the imputation of malice but rather tend to repel it It does not name the person at whom it is directed It states in language as mild as could have been employed the conclusion of the person charged with the duty of making the investigation and that conclusion was warranted by the preponderance of evidence which includes the testimony of every disinterested witness present upon the occasion Upon the whole case we are of opinion that the judgment com plained of should be affirmed Affirmed NOTEThe decision in this case seems a correct application of the law of libel as applicable to privileged communications The result reached on the demurrer to evidence seems also correct If as the court well says the questions were as to the truth or falsity of the publication on the demurrer to evidence it must have been held to be false But the real issue where the publication is privileged is not whether the published state ment is in fact true or false but whether the defendant had reasonable ground to believe it to be true and acted reasonably and in good faith Bad faith or malice in such case is not presumed from the mere falsity of the publication as is the case of nonprivileged statements The plaintiff was therefore put upon his proof of bad faith and actual malice This proof he failed utterly to supply The defendant on the other hand by testimony not in conflict with the plaintiffs and therefore not waived by its demurrer disclosed the circumstances under which it caused the publication to be made and these circumstances seem abund antly to justify the defendants action howsoever false in fact the statements contained in the publication may have been

MINNESOTA HOUSE AIR To THE EDITOR OF SCIENCE I had occasion recently to consult the issue of SCIENCE for September 29 1911 and read for the first time the letter on  House Air  from Professor J Y Bergen of Cambridge He makes this statement regarding the ventilation obtained from a hot air register The ventilation  is much better than can be obtained in summer by opening a single window to its full height It is doubtless known to him and should be 577 more widely known that it is better to pull the window down a couple of inches from the top and up from the bottom when ventilation is required than to open either half only The truth of this statement can easily be tested by holding a lighted candle at the window open ings G L MANNING ROBERT COLLEGE January 23 1912 QUOTATIONS MOST RECENT INVESTIGATIONS ON THE DETERMINA TION PRESERVATIVE ACTION AND ADMISSI BILITY OF THE USE OF BENZOIC ACID1 PART II2 I NOW come to the most intportant part of my worka critical summary of the three de tailed investigations on the effect of benzoic acid and of benzoates on man which have been carried out during the last four years and which now furnish us that broad basis which I have always desired necessary for the for mation of an intelligent opinion First there are two great works from the American De partment of Agriculture one carried out by H W Wiley in 1908 the other by a commis sion under the chairmanship of the distin guished chemist Ira Remsen consisting of the three wellknown American scientists Pro fessor Russell H Chittenden of Yale Univer sity Professor John H Long of Northwest ern University and Professor Christian A Herter of Columbia University New York It seems strange that a great government should publish two books one right after the other dealing with the same subjectmatter aid we seek in vain in the second large volume of 761 pages for a word of explanation of this surprising fact Wileys work is simply ig Translated from the ChemikerZeitung COthen

action use and toxic effects of benzoic acid J Boo Chem Ind 28 67 1909 APRIL 12 1912N S VoL XXXV No 902 nored in the publication of Chittenden Long and Herter as if it had never existed From this it may be concluded at once that the re sults or conclusions of Wiley did not seem to the second commission worth discussing This is so much the more surprising in that Wiley under the authority of the Department of Agriculture has for years been publish ing similar investigations on boric acid sali cylic acid etc Under these circumstances I had at first thought of leaving Wileys work entirely out of consideration but since Dr V Gerlach of Wiesbaden in the third of the detailed publications mentioned above ex presses his regret that he had access to only a short abstract of Wileys investigation a discussion of the original which now lies be fore me will be appropriate especially as the work will become even more difficultly acces sible in the future Wiley studied the effect of benzoic acid on six persons and that of sodium benzoate on six others In each case a 10day period with out the preservative was followed by a 5day period with 1 gram then by periods of equal length with 15 20 and 25 grams each of the preservative and finally by another 10 day period without the preservative i e 40 days in 20 of which benzoic acid was admin istered Above all it is to be regretted that the preparations were given in capsules and that the small quantities 02505 gram which in practise are most important were not administered as the minimal dose was 1 gram and finally that the experiments were extended only over a relatively short time As far as concerns the results I cling to the good custom of not doubting an investiga tors facts and analytical data only the basis and logic of the conclusions are here discussed From the experiments which are reported carefully and in considerable detail in 250 pages Wiley concludes some very disadvan tageous things for benzoic acid He finds It is evident that the use of benzoic acid either as such or in the form of sodium benzoate is 4 Physiologische Wirkungen der Benzoesaure und des benzoesauren Natrons Verlag von H Staadt Wiesbaden 1909 highly objectionable and that it produces grave disturbances of the metabolism and health irrita tion of the stomach nausea headache and in a few cases vomiting So much the more impor tance is placed on these symptoms as they were observed in healthy men well and carefully fed All the test persons showed a distinct loss in weight and all the more or less marked changes in metabolism shown by investigation of the urine and feces were always of such a nature that they could never be regarded as a favorable change In my opinion this sentence might just as well read Careful investigation of the urine feces and metabolism did not show a single symptom from which a disturbance due to the partaking of benzoic acid might be deduced That the normal condition could not be im proved by benzoic acid as Wiley seems to re quire is not surprising As Wiley is thus far the only investigator who supported by com prehensive experiments has formed a con demnatory opinion of benzoic acid on toxico logical grounds I have taken the trouble to criticize his work somewhat more closely and to examine the value of his arguments The very thorough examination of the urine which is reported in many tables showed nothing special Who could lay much value on the fact that in the benzoicacid periods the amount of solid substances in the urine in creases 23 grams i e from 555 to 578 when in the first place the diet is not strictly fixed and secondly the addition of 12 grams of benzoic acid per day almost completely covers the increase The relation of sulphur to nitro gen sulphuric acid to nitrogen and phosphoric acid to nitrogen remained entirely unchanged with the arbitrary diet the variations of 13 per cent either way of the values are un avoidable The alkylsulphuric acids remained perfectly constant the absolute amount of urinary sulphur changed only to an insignifi cant degree explainable by the method of pro cedure a decrease of neutral sulphur from 14 to 124 per cent in the benzoic acid period and to 111 per cent in the after period seems to be proved while on the other hand the total sulphur shows an increase from 859 to 877 and 889 per cent But any one wanting to 578 SCIENCESCIENCE draw any conclusions from this might just as well instead of supposing like Wiley an in crease of oxidation infer that the oxidizing power of the body is distinctly increased a little by rather large doses of benzoic acid and increases still more after the excretion of the benzoic acid a sign of an especially powerful cell activity It is an interesting fact that the separation of benzoic acid as hippuric acid does not take place very quickly but that an after period following a rather prolonged ben zoic acid diet still shows increased hippuric acid The microscopic investigation of the urinethe method is not described in detail was made six times in all for each of the twelve persons studiedonce each in the fore and after periods and four times in the ben zoic acid periods The results are represented by numbers 0 nothing 1 l very little 2 little 3 considerable 4 much 5 very much The following substances were sought for crystals of uric acid oxalates and phosphates amorphous phosphates epithelial cells and leucocytes hyaline cylinders finely granulated and coarsely granulated cylinders mucous cylinders mucous fibers The num bers were added for the twelve persons and divided by twelve and the values so obtained compared in percentages According to the mean values most of the organized elements are increased somewhat leaving out the crystals the leucocytes and the finely and coarsely granulated cylinders are somewhat in creased the hyaline cylinders somewhat dimin ished and the mucous fibers hardly appreciably increased Considering how strongly a 2 influences the ls and Os which are found in greater number it is preferable to consider more closely each individual constituent of the six series When this is done it is found that excepting the mucous cylinders in crease of 50 per cent nothing at all re mains of all the construed increases But as the mucous fibers do not markedly increase I set no importance on the increase of Athe mucous cylinders Wiley however concludes that there is a slight tendency towards an in crease of renal activity during the benzoic acid periods This slight tendency to 579 cause everything that is possibly bad is con strued everywhere that Wiley can say nothing definite In the feces nothing remarkable was found On an average in the experiments with benzoic acid the feces were a trifle drier in the benzoate experiments somewhat damper during and after the administration of the preservative than before it was given That the majority of Wileys twelve persons should have lost 0520 kilograms on a freely chosen diet is very remarkable and we should much like to learn more as to the principles on which the amount of food was measured The amounts of dry substance fat nitrogen and calories daily taken in the individual periods vary not inconsiderablywith a faint tendency in most cases to decrease in the course of the forty dayswhich alone explains the slight decreases in weight We do not learn why a greater regularity in the taking of food was not striven for I repro duce some particulars concerning one per son Test Person 1 0 W N had nothing particular to complain of against benzoic acid but found that his strength decreased markedly so that he could hardly do his work At the same time however it is stated that this person was often very hungry that the abundant and varied food with 4000 calories was not sufficient for him On the other hand it is seen from page 1090 that during the fore period this person partook of 606 grams of dry food on the average during the total benzoic acid periods of 590 grams and in the after period of only 567 grams Why more food was not given him remains incompre hensible as he had already decreased 05 kilo gram in weight in the second 5day fore period and 03 kilogram in the first 5day ben zoic acid period and was hungry In this record I see nothing but decreased body weight and consequent feeling of weakness probably increased by suggestion resulting from a somewhat too limited consumption of food To other persons was given 1 per cent of the body weight in dry substance to No 1 only 087 per cent On page 1166 we learn to our surprise that Person 1 who daily took about 1314 grams of nitrogen daily gained 4PRIL 12 1912N S VOL XXXV No 902 in spite of decrease in weight 053 gram ni trogen in the fore period 039 gram in the ben zoic acid period and 141 grams in the after period and therefore apparently became poorer in fat and richer in albumin And we learn further that Person 1 did not at all stand alone in this respect In spite of decreases in weight and disturbances of metabolism of subjective nature five of the twelve persons increased seven decreased in nitrogen in the average of all twelve experiments there was even in all the periods and subperiods of the 40day test a daily increase of 1215 grams of nitrogen The nitrogen was used to the best advantage on an average for all the test persons 726 per cent was excreted in the feces in the fore period 744 in the benzoic acid period and 816 in the after period The phosphoric acid meta bolism was hardly influenced but it is true as Wiley brings out that during the benzoic acid period the phosphoric acid increases a trifle about 3 per cent in the feces and decreases by about the same amount in the urine in the after period the increase in the feces and the decrease in the urine were somewhat more marked Wiley draws no conclusions from this This might be considered as a poorer utilization of the phosphorus of the food but greater guarantee as to the amount and na ture of combination of the phosphorus com pounds given would be necessary That the number of blood corpuscles would also show variations was clear Their number was greatly raised as compared with the fore period after 2 administrations of benzoic acid considerably decreased as compared with the fore period after 3 administrations was about the same as in the fore period after 1 administration increased after 3 doses of sodium benzoate decreased after 2 doses not determined after 1 dose The general average for all twelve persons was as follows Fore period  Benzoie acid period After period  Red Corpuscles 5082273 5099583 5255000 White Corpuscles 7433 7331 6644 Hemo globin Per Cent 96 96 97 No conclusion therefore for or against benzoic acid can be drawn from these data yet Wiley speaks of a tendency to dimin ish the red corpuscles which benzoic acid seems to have In my honest opinion Wileys publication is lacking in every proof every objective proof of the harmfulness of benzoic acid and from the voluminous metabolism investiga tions which Wiley has so pitilessly used against benzoic acid exactly the opposite con clusion may be drawn that at most each and every entirely subordinate fact I have care fully reproduced them all above from Wileys publication remains somewhat doubtful in its significance From Wileys report on sub jective symptoms of digestive disturbances by 12 gram quantities of benzoic acid in wafers no conclusions can be drawn even with this method of procedure so illadapted to our prob lem the data stand too isolated in the litera ture They give the impression that sugges tion played a considerable part in them for there is no doubt that in Wileys laboratory preservatives are considered with extreme mis trust and antipathy and that the test persons should imbibe some of this antipathy is easily conceivable I surmise that this was also the general impression of the American authorities and that new investigations by Chittenden Long and Herter were instituted to critically test Wileys results which were contrary to all observations so far made in the laboratory and in practise Although the volume of analyses and ob servations reported by Wiley and their evi dent cost are considerable the extent of the work of the other investigators is surprising This voluminousness of the work especially the numberless tables makes it difficult to enter very much into the details of it Moreover it is really a question of three inde pendent pieces of work The three gentle men entirely independently of each other but following a carefully preconcerted plan each subjected 6 6 and 4 young physicians and chemists respectively to metabolism investi 580 SCIENCEAPRIL 12 1912 gations lasting not less than four months There were thus 16 X 120  1920 test days On 40 of the 120 days i e on 640 days exact urinary analyses were made The benzoic acid was given in the following manner In a fore period of 10 days no benzoic acid was given then for two months 03 gram was given daily then none for 5 days 06 gram for 7 days 1 gram for 7 days 2 grams for 7 days 4 6 and 10 grams respectively for 7 days and finally for 10 days no benzoic acid was given the individual experimenters worked a little differently the benzoic acid was mixed with the food and given as sodium benzoate It must also be pointed out that the test persons were not exclusively of espe cially robust health in fact some of rather moderate constitution were taken In the first pages of the work is given briefly clearly and concisely what interests us most the conclusions of the three investi gators Sodium benzoate in small doses less than 05 gram mixed with the food is without toxic effect and does not disturb health Sodium benzoate in large doses up to 4 grams mixed with the food showed upon investigation no harmful effect in the general sense of the word In some directions were observed small changes in certain physiolog ical processes the exact significance of which changes is not known According to the investigations the mix ing of sodium benzoate in smaller or larger doses has no unfavorable or deteriorating in fluence on the value of such food In this series of experiments also the test persons were not in exact nitrogen equilibrium They were allowed to enjoy at will within certain limits quite complicated extremely varied and dainty foods the food being merely weighed and analyzed The daily consump tion of food which in Germany in such ex periments we keep as nearly as possible uniform in nature and equal in amount varied not inconsiderably even though it must be confessed that the daily consumption of food by this method was relatively uniform We can therefore without more evidence just as easily draw favorable conclusions for benzoic acid from the slight increases in weight which almost all of these wellfed test persons showed as unfavorable ones from the opposite facts in the Wiley experiments It only shows that benzoic acid is not grossly harmful Exact metabolism observations in the absolute sense are also impossible only relative values can be discussed exactly and here too the so widely varying nutrition is a somewhat disturbing factor The utilization of dry substance fat and albumin as we are accustomed to observe it in Germany is not ascertained here But I have convinced myself from a series of values which I have calculated that no influences on the utilization are to be observed The cor puscular elements in the urine were not con trary to the observations of Wiley increased No general symptoms were noted either with the smaller or the larger doses Of the num berless details of the three investigations we can safely say that like Wileys they show that in almost all special cases nothing essen tial is changed by the administration of ben zoic acid I may therefore confine myself to picking out a few points Ohittenden ex presses at the end his extraordinarily favor able opinion that sodium benzoate up to a dose of 4 grams daily is no more disturbing or harmful to the human organism than the same quantities of salt He makes no reser vation in any direction draws no suspicious conclusions from his observations not even from the establishment by Wileys results that the excretion of benzoic acid as hippuric acid in the urine is somewhat retarded Long obtains very favorable results he did indeed observe in his uneducated test persons institute help etc a slight disturbance at times headache vomiting disturbance of sight excitement but always found a plaus ible explanation for it and never feels forced to ascribe it to benzoic acid Herter noticed especially with large doses a slight increase of indican in the urine but no change in the alkylsulphuric acid a decrease of the fecal bacteria which evolve gases and an increase of the cocci as compared with other bacteria in 581 SCIENCE N S VOL XXXV No 902 the feces All these facts find a natural ex planation in a somewhat decreased carbohy drate fermentation in the feces and somewhat increased scission of albumen owing to cer tain bacteria or bacterial functions being favored by the benzoic acid at the expense of others no one will interpret this as being hygienically dubious Herters values p 747 show very prettily the smooth transfor mation of benzoic acid into hippuric acid ac cording to his experiments there is no ap preciable retardation A striking fact in all four of Herters test persons was the increase of free hydrochloric acid in the expressed gas tric juice during large benzoate doses which could easily be considered as a symptom of irritation of the stomach but is also capable of other explanations Gerlachs experiments see below showed nothing of this in man or animal There are many other details in this voluminous book but they are hardly of significance for the problem and I have tried to bring out anything that might be disad vantageous for benzoic acid Most perspicuous to us Germans is the in vestigation carried out by Dr Gerlach of Wiesbaden by German physiologicopharma ceutical methods and which though far be hind the American works in scope and extent can be the more easily surveyed as a whole Small medium and large doses were tested on animals and men I shall not enter into the details of the experiments with rabbits which were able to take very large doses of benzoic acid without any effects One gram of benzoic acid was borne subcutaneously by a rabbit for 12 days without harm a dog was fed with 75 grams of sodium benzoate in one dose without disturbing effects in experi ments on the investigator himself 10 grams of benzoic acid taken within 3 hours had no influence on the pulse respiration body tem perature digestion and general wellbeing Not every stomach can stand such a dose  Abstractor Two persons daily took 05 and 1 gram of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate respectively for 8090 days without any ef fect The most careful observation showed no special disturbances of the respiration pulse or body temperature after taking 1 and 2 grams of benzoic acid and sodium ben zoate respectively The action of the diges tive ferments gastric juice trypsin and the diastatic ferments was not influenced by ben zoic acid and sodium benzoate Three and five grams of benzoic acid and sodium ben zoate had no influence on the quantity acid content and digestive power of the gastric juice of a dog subjected to the Pawlow opera tion Half a gram and one gram of benzoic acid and sodium benzoate respectively taken by the experimenter at a test breakfast ex erted no influence on the free hydrochloric acid total acidity and digestive power of the gastric juice collected one hour after the breakfast In metabolism experiments on men it was found that 1 gram benzoic acid or 15 grams sodium benzoate each taken 6 successive days had no effect whatever on the stock of albumin in the body nor on the utilization of the nitrogenous substance and fat in the food Eightytwo doses of 1 gram each of benzoic acid taken within 86 days and 88 doses taken within 92 days showed no unfavorable effects on the general wellbeing body weight etc At the end of the experi ments it was found that the beizoic acid whether mixed foods or chiefly vegetables were eaten was completely transformed into hippuric acid Gerlach collects from the literature a large number of cases not all of which are contained in my earlier review and which show that large doses of benzoic acid can be taken by healthy and by sick people without harm and he concludes with the words Neither the observations made in medical prac tise and reported in the literature nor the large number of experiments which have been carried out for the purpose seem to justify the assertion that benzoic acid and sodium benzoate in small quantities such as they are eaten in preserved foods are able to produce any harm whatever The attempt to prohibit the use of benzoic acic and benzoates as a preservative would therefore not be warranted by the very copious scientific material at hand 582 SCIENCEAPRIL 12 1912 SCIENCE While the American investigators and Ger lach thus reach conclusions which could not be more favorable to those who espouse the cause of benzoic acid the question as to the admissibility of its use is not yet wholly cleared up in Europe especially in Germany and an unfriendly disposition predominates France summarily prohibited the use of ben zoic acid as early as 1888 long therefore be fore its thorough investigation in Austria also it was excluded from use by a decision of the chief of the Board of Health on the 16th of December 1899 and recently again he has refused his sanction8 The Landes medizinalkollegium of Saxony has likewise refused to authorize its use In Germany the law takes no firm stand against benzoic acid The acquittal of dealers who introduced margarine preserved with benzoic acid into the trade in Saxony is inter esting The produce dealer Gertrud Eberlein nee Herber who had been fined 2 Marks for dealing in margarine with 005 per centbenzoic acid had started a long trial in three courts which however had ended with her acquittal in the assessorss district and provincial courts Injury to health by such doses of benzoic acid no one could maintain the opponents of benzoic acid among the judges asserted that benzoic acid is really a preservative that the addition of benzoic acid makes it possible to store margarine but that the public demands fresh margarine and that the stored product is not as good as the fresh margarine The arguments frequently made by the judges in favor of acquittal were the following Benzoic acid has thus far not been prohibited in Ger many it occurs in cowberries in considerable quantities in the amounts in question it is harmless the nutritive value wholesomeness and usefulness of the margarine is not changed it is therefore a preservative which where applicable offers great advantages long sought for without any disadvantages The following judicial verdicts concerning benzoic acid in margarine have come to

are harmless to the human body but they continue Whether larger amounts quantities of several grams could in the long run be borne equally without effect by everybody can not as yet be answered with certainty The experiments of the American scientists in this connection are of too limited extent and suffer from certain limitations so that they can not be considered as proof of universal harmlessness With these carefully worded sentences we can on the whole agree without however drawing the conclusion therefrom that ben zoic acid as a preservative is to be prohibited For first of all we must consider that there are many food constituents which under such a system we might mistrust and likewise pro hibit I might mention hops in beer sugar in preserves and salt in salt meat There are beyond doubt many of whom it can be said with certainty that not only the repeated con sumption of such things but even a single meal off of them is prejudicial to their health Those suffering from urethral diseases can not stand hops diabetes patients and persons with stomach troubles can not stand preserves kid ney sufferers can not stand salt yet such sufferers are continually eating these things consciously or unconsciously without any one prohibiting them to the world Secondly from what has been said above it is evident that benzoic acid considering its preservative action on acid substances poor in albumin for others it does not come into considera tion is remarkably harmless to the healthy and the sickwith no other preservative have such daring experiments been performed on sick persons without harm If a healthy or a sick person were given just once ten times the amount of tobacco alcohol or even of sugar that is usually taken rationally the results would be far worse than when instead of 01 to 05 gram benzoic acid 15 grams are given I offered this same argument with equal justi fication many years ago to those who persisted in considering saccharin as a poison Thirdly no one has thus far asked more than that it be considered whether certain special food products might not under proper declaration be treated with small quantities of benzoic acid No one except perhaps a few manufacturers has ever dreamed simply of a permission to add benzoic acid to foods On the contrary there can not be much doubt that for meat and meat preparations benzoic acid and benzoates should be prohibited they have little preservative power and when mixed with other substances phosphates they help to preserve a fresh color while the decompo sition goes on like the sulphites therefore they give a deceptive appearance of better con dition and according to the HeffterAbel de cision even a slight odor of putrefaction of minced meat is masked or removed by the ad mixture of 025 per cent of benzoic acid or benzoates No one will demand the free use of benzoic acid for tinned vegetable preserves in these cases nothing but heat is necessary The question is whether its use for preserving egg yolks tomatoes lemon juice and similar preparations as well as margarine and this is at present the most important can be per mitted The firstnamed preparations egg yolks tomatoes lemon juice are of subordi nate interest as regards public nutrition and can be passed without further discussion even the most timid would not need to fear gravely for the public health if benzoic acid in such preparations were allowed a state ment as to the amount used being required Personally I am unconditionally in its favor when it is proved that these products can be prepared in a nonperishable form and kept without preservatives only with great diffi culty or not at all The question as to allowing the use of ben zoic acid in margarine which has become a real public foodstuff demands special treatment One hundred and fifty million kilograms of margarine are said to be produced annually in Germany and a considerable part of it used in this country8 It would be very difficult to day especially for those living in cities to protect themselves against margarine in their food Any one in a hotel or purchasing fatty 18 Z MargInd 1910 134 584 SCIENCESCIENCE confectionery or bakery wares will at once make the acquaintance of margarine only the preparation of ill food in ones own house in sures safety Margarine has won this position in spite of all compulsory declarations in spite of the foreignsounding name because it fills the need of the people for a cheap fat Leaving out one recent case where the crim inal negligence of a firm in carelessly selling a poisonous foreign fat caused many cases of illness and some deaths so far there has not been much with which margarine can be re proached K B LEHMAN HYGIENIC INSTITUTE WUfZBURG SCIENTIFIC

many Switzerland and the United States have resulted in the perfection of instru ments and methods and the accumulation of a mass of results Steuers treatise on plank tology thus finds the time opportune for ap pearance and fittingly forms a volume in the 586 Teubner series  Naturwissenschaft und Technik in Lehre und  Forschung  under the editorship of Professors Doflein and Fischer of Munich The first work is comprehensive in plan covering all phases of the varied content of the subject of the life of the sea and of fresh water The first chapter of the work deals with water its

methods quantitative qualitative and statis tical of plankton investigations of the adap tations of the plankton to flotation with special reference to viscosity in relation to temperature and season of adaptations in color and of phosphorescence It appears that the data cited by Steuer are quite inadequate to establish his thesis that the organisms of the plankton as compared with those of the bottom and shore are char acterized by a relatively low rate of reproduc tion It is not the pelagic nature of the or ganism which is the cause of the low rate of reproduction often observed in planktonpoor lakes but rather a poverty stricken habitat The herring fisheries the chalk beds of past ages the abundant and rapidly fluctuating plankton of enriched rivers the occasional sudden outbursts of the mare sporco all bear indisputable evidence of the capacity of pelagic life to respond to opportunities for rapid multiplication This erroneous idea that the plankton has a relatively slight ca pacity for reproduction is correlated with another all too widely applied idea namely that the tropical seas are relatively barren The facts are that fresh waters and the sea vary greatly in different regions and at differ ent seasons in the amount of life they contain In warm waters the chemical processes of life are so accelerated that life cycles are short ened and decay is hastened while in colder waters growth and decay are slower and indi viduals accumulate though the total product in the two regions in a given time may be the same Food supply and temperature affect APRIL 12

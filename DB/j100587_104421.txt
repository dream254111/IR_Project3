FROM MR WILLIAM WATSON APOTHECARY F R S TO THE S O C I E T Y CON CERNING SOME PERSONS BEING POISONED BY EAT ING BOILED HEMLOCK GENTLEMEN NOTWITHSTANDING THE NUMBER OF IN STANCES WHICH OCCUR AMONG WRITERS CONCERNING THE POISONOUS QUALITY OF OUR COMMON HEMLOCK OR CICUTA MAJOR OF CASPAR BAUHIN SUCH AS THAT OF CARDANUS MENTIONING A MAN KILLD BY A CAKE WHEREIN THIS PLANT WAS AN INGREDIENT THAT OF BRASSAVOLA WHO ASSURES US THAT IT IS MORTAL NOT TO MEN ONLY BUT TO GEESE AND SWINE AS WELL AS THOSE OF READ MAY 10 174419 OF MATTHIOLUS SCALIGER KIRCHER BOCCONE AND OTHERS YET THE FATALITY OF ITS POISON WHEN GROWING IN THIS KINGDOM HAS BEEN DOUBTED BY MANY INAS MUCH AS THAT FAITHFUL COLLECTOR THE LATE MR RAY MENTIONS IN HIS SYNOPSIS EDIT 2 PAG 326 THAT NOT ONLY HIS FRIEND MR PETIVER EAT HALF AN OUNCE OF THE ROOT OF THIS PLANT BUT THAT MR HENLY A FRIEND OF MR PETIVERS IN HIS PRESENCE EAT WITH OUT ANY INCONVENIENCE THREE OR FOUR OUNCES OF THE SAME ROOT FROM HENCE IT HAS BEEN THOUGHT EITHER THAT THE ROOT HAS EFFECTS DIFFERENT FROM THE STALKS AND LEAVES OR THAT DIFFERENCE OF CLIMATE VARIES THE DEGREE OF THE VIOLENCE OF THE POISON AN OBSERVATION INDEED OF THE SAME KIND OCCURS IN THE GERMAN EPHEMERIDES LINNAEUS IN THE HORTUS CLIFFORTIANUS MAKES ALSO SOME DOUBT CONCERNING THE MALIGNITY OF THIS PLANT AND IN NAMING IT HAS KEPT TO THE OLD APPELLATION OF THEOPHRASTUS AND DIOSCORIDES CONIUM AND HAS TRANSFERRD THAT OF CI CUTA TO THE CICUTA AQUATICA OF GESNER AND OF WEPFER BESIDES MANY OF THE ACCIDENTS SAID TO HAVE PROCEEDED FROM CICUTA OR HEMLOCK HAVE BEEN OCCASIOND BY DIFFERENT PLANTS SOME OF THE ACCIDENTS PROBABLY FROM THE COMMON ONE BUT MANY MORE FROM THE CICUTA AQUATICA BEFOREMENTIOND AND FROM THE OENANTHE SUCCO VIROSO CICUTAE FACIE OF LOBEL THIS CONFUSION APPEARS MANIFESTLY IN SEVERAL AUTHORS AND SOME OF THEM OF THE GREATEST CREDIT WHICH OF THESE PLANTS OR WHETHER ANY OF THEM WAS THE ATHE NIAN POISON NOBODY HAS DETERMINED ALTHO THE EATING OF THE ROOTS AS ABOVEMEN TIOND WAS ATTENDED WITH NO BAD CONSEQUENCES A LATE MELANCHOLY ACCIDENT HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY CON C 2 VINCING20 VINCING OF THE POISONOUS QUALITY OF THE LEAVES OF THE CICUTA MAJOR ON SUNDAYMAY 6 1744 TWO OF THE DUTCH SOLDIERS LATELY ARRIVED WHO WERE QUARTERD AT WALTHAMABBEY IN ESSEX COLLECTED IN THE FIELDS ADJOINING A QUAN TITY OF HERBS SUFFICIENT FOR THEMSELVES AND TWO OTHERS FOR DINNER WHEN BOILED WITH BACON THESE HERBS WERE ACCORDINGLY DRESSED AND THE POOR MEN FIRST EAT OF THE BROTH WITH BREAD AND AFTERWARDS EAT THE HERBS WITH THE BACON IN A SHORT TIME AFTER THEY WERE ALL SEIZED WITH VIOLENT VERTIGOS THEY SOON AFTER WERE COMATOSE AND TWO OF THEM GREW CONVULSED AND DIED IN ABOUT THREE HOURS THE PEOPLE OF THE TOWN BEING EXCEEDINGLY ALARMED AT THIS ACCIDENT A PHYSICIAN DR BARROWBY JUNIOR BEING THERE IMMEDIATELY WENT AND ORDERD THE OTHER TWO AT THAT TIME ALMOST DEAD LARGE QUANTITIES OF OIL BY WHICH MEANS THEY THREW UP MOST OF WHAT THEY HAD EATEN AND AFTERWARDS GREW BETTER IN ALL OF THEM THE EFFECTS WERE THE SAME AS THOSE FROM A LARGE DOSE OF OPIUM THE NEXT DAY BEING AT THE PLACE I SAW ONE OF THESE MEN MUCH RECOVERD AND ONLY COMPLAINING OF A HEAVINESS IN HIS HEAD BUT THE OTHER WAS SO WELL AS TO BE GONE TO PERFORM EXERCISE WITH THE OTHER SOLDIERS THERE WAS A FIFTH SOLDIER WHOM I SAW WHO TOLD ME HE EAT SOME OF THE BREAD OUT OF THE BROTH BUT FELT SCARCE ANY INCONVENIENCE THEREFROM IT SO HAPPEND THAT THE TWOMEN WHO GATHERD THE HERBS WERE BOTH KILLED AS I WENT DOWN TO THE PLACE TO SATISFY MYSELF IN THIS MATTER A DUTCH OFFICER WENT WITH ME VERY COURTEOUSLY TO AN INN WHERE THERE WERE TWO OTHER SOLDIERS WHO HAD SEEN AND KNEW THE HERBS WHICH HAD21 HAD BEEN EATEN HE WAS SO KIND ALSO AS TO ATTEND ME WITH THESE SOLDIERS INTO THE FIELDS TO SHEW ME THE PLANTS GROWING THEY FIRST GATHERD ME THE CICU TARIA VULGARIS OF JOHN BAUHIN OR COWWEED THEN THE MYRRHIS SYLVESTRIS SEMINIBUS ASPERIS OF CASPAR BAUHIN OR SMALL HEMLOCKCHERVIL THEY THEN GAVE ME SOME CICUTA MAJOR AND SMELLING IT IMMEDI ATELY SAID THAT THIS WAS THE HERB THAT KILLD THEIR COMRADES WHICH I THEN HAD NO REASON TO DOUBT OF AS OF THE TWO FORMER PLANTS THE FIRST GROWS ALMOST UNDER EVERY HEDGE AND IS EATEN BY THE COWS AND THE OTHER IS FREQUENTLY GIVEN TO TAME RABBETS FOR FOOD WHEREAS CATTLE CONSTANTLY REFUSE TO EAT HEM LOCK BEFORE I WAS THUS SATISFIED I IMAGINED THIS ACCI DENT TO HAVE PROCEEDED RATHER FROM LOBELS OENAN THE THINKING THAT AS THAT PLANT GROWS NEAR THE SIDES OF RIVERS THESE SOLDIERS MIGHT HAVE GATHERD IT BY THE RIVER LEE WHICH RUNS BY THE TOWN AND EATEN IT FOR SMALLAGE TO WHICH IT HAS SOME RESEM BLANCE IT IS NOW KNOWN THAT THE CICUTA MAJOR THE CI CUTA AQUATICA AND THE OENANTHE OF LOBEL ARE CER TAIN POISONS BUT THERE ARE TWO OTHERS OF THE SAME CLASS GROWING COMMON IN ENGLAND AND NOT MUCH UNLIKE THESE IN SMELL AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES VE HEMENTLY TO BE SUSPECTED THE ONE IS THE CICUTARIA TENUIFOLIA OF MR RAY WHICH GROWS FREQUENTLY IN WASTE PLACES AND IN GARDENS AMONG POTHERBS OF WHICH DE LA CHAMP GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF ITS MA LIGNANCY THE OTHER IS THE CICUTARIA PALUSTRIS OF LOBEL AND TABERNAEMONTANUS OR PHELLANDRIUM OF DODONAEUS WHICH GROWS IN MUDDY DITCHES AND PONDS I DONT22 I DONT REMEMBER ANY HISTORY OF THE PERNICIOUS EFFECTS OF THE CICUTA MAJOR IN THIS KINGDOM BUT AS THE DETECTING POISONOUS PLANTS IS OF VERY GREAT CONSEQUENCE I PRESUME TO LAY THIS PAPER BEFORE YOU AND AM GENTLEMEN LONDON MAY 9 1744 YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT W WATSON

investigations Professor Royce who is the chair lwqan of the corlamittee on apparitions and haunted houses jocularly referred to this difficulty in his report at the recent meeting of the soclety in Boston As Professor Royce said the name suggesting as it does that the tirne of the committee is mainly spent in visiting haunted laouses and ghostridden graveyards does not describe its actual office The committee has often expressed its willing ess to visit haunted houses or to pass the night in any promising place for the sale of seeing explaining or of converting from the error of its ways any genuine ghost in the city or in the neighbor hood of Boston The committee has heard of several houses that once were believed to t3e haunted but in no case has the present tcondition of these houses warranted any interference on the com mittees part The phenomena have in all cases so far reported neased for some tinqe usually for many years A more hopeful field is in the directiorl of tracing some coincidence between a dream or presetltirrwent and its supposed verification by events afterwards but even in this direction the results are so scattering as hardly to justify the belief in any special significance in the few coincidences which have been traced AItERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION1 ONE of the most original papers presented at the recent meeting of the American Public Health Association was by Dr E M Hunt secretary of the DJew Jersey State Board of Health on the origin of some diseases It was as follows CPAPER BY DR E M HUNT1 The class of diseases variously known as contagious transmis sible or communicable has ever attracted the most earnest con sideration of medical men and of all sanitarians By the quickness and often obscurity of their invasion by the malignant type they too often exhibit and by the large areas over which they extend they not only make large demands upon the skill of the profession but arrest the attention of all mankind The study of epidemiology has enlarged their numbers and now shows us that many diseases once regarded as constitutional or septic are in reality specific and pathogenic or mostly parasitic The prevention and lilzxitation of this class of maladies must ever therefore largely occupy the attention of all of those who study the causes the courses and the results of disease The study of their etiology is always a fundamental inquiry While to a degree it is possible to treat a disease skilfully without knowing its eauses it is always more satisfactory and generally more skilful to know something of the causes But what do we mearu by etiology or causes  Surely not always not generally the beginruirlg or efficient or final cause Professor Semmola of Naples at the reeent meeting of the Medical Congress at Washington may have startled some by these words Medi cine like all other seierlees never demallds why well knowing that the first causes of thirlgs are irwaccessible and that to every seien tist it should suffiee to know in which physical and chemical con ditions this or that phenomeraon manifests itself so that he ean modify and govern it at his will This is true The best that we ean generally hope is to fitld the conditions physical chemical or biological in which phenolnena manifest themselves The word 1 ContixItled from Sczence of Dec 9  cause  is often in the same sentence used in two or three differ ent senses In our etiology we must remember that by cause  we mean mostly the  conditions under which phenomena manifest themselves also that these conditions thus called causes mean the modifying influences present in the host or person and the modifying influences of surroundings much oftener than they mean any thing in the specific entity which we are so often calling the germ and then calling it the cause While reaching back toward the beginning even though we sel dom reach the startingpoint we do come to see how it is true of every disease as of every living thing that it must have had a be ginning It is not a mere platitude to say that there was a day when the first case of smallpox occurred Nor does it necessarily belong to the sphere either of creation or spontaneous generation A case of some new disease may put in an appearance as did cholera on the Ganges or a case of a known and existing disease may happen that is not derived from another precisely like it but occurs because analogous conditions to those which gave rise to the first case of the kind have again occurred and produced a pronounced deviation So it is possible that at the same time as to some one disease we may have cases of a communicable disease which have arisen from previous cases and other cases that have resulted from a combi nation of influences or conditions such as gave rise to the first case There are at least two reasons why the old dictum of omne vgaum ab ovo cannot now be applied with the precision or with the finality with which it used to be quoted I There is such a thing as evolution which while recognizing an original type also recognizes departures from the normal which may have come to be so representative and paramount as to con stitute newness in all essential particulars Since we have comae to recognize that many diseases are but developments and cultures of microphytic or microbic life we very appropriately turn to the facts of botany not only for illustration but for verification of our theories And what a change has taken place in its facts since the days of Linnaus  We no longer cling to the divisions of ordersS genera and species so closely laid down by him We recognize two forces nature or heredity and environment A plant in herits a likeness which it tends to retain but it is often so modified by environment as greatly to change and so sometimes as even to lose its identity Environment comes to predominate over heredity The horticulturist often takes a plant which he has found to be sub ject to variations and fixes and perfects it in some olle of them by cultivation Professor Huxley has recently contributed to the Linntan Society a paper on the classification of gentians in which he claims that gentians are all specialized that is become gentians from some other form Permanency of type has so many exceptions that variations of type and the power to give fixity to some of these variations by means of cultivation or environment must be accepted as a doctrine and a fact Species and genera have variations sports modifications not dreamed of by the earlier botanists Some of these departures are so marked and so predominant as to ob scure the relationship and so far ignore it as to have individuality of their own If as we know cultivation or surroundings can change a poisonous plant into a mild one or can wholly modify it it is not remarkable that a microphytic disease should lose its ap parent identity and at length in a new culturemedium or under special conditions become specialized It is a law abundantly il lustrated in the vegetable world that environment causes variations and that some of these variations tend to fixity of type while others do not All the wonderful facts of evolution show full well thatwe may in this way have what in respect of symptoms and treatment is a new disease Yet it is not a de novo origin in an absolute sense or if practically de novo it is not de nSio It is that a FRIDAY DECEMBER I6 I887 SCIENCESCIENCE Vot X No 254  phytes may become pathogenic and that the different forms of microorganisms present have relation to each other and that the culturemedium in disease viz the person and his surroundings determines the character of the microorganisms full as much as the microorganisms determine the character of the disease If the views as to the microphytic origin of most of the com municable diseases are correct the study of the laws of this evolu tion and hybridism is vital We believe it is in this direction that we are to account for the origin of new diseases or for such vari ations in type as obscure or destroy identity If we can through this study arrive at the evidence that in this sense many diseases begin we have a new department of study in that we are called upon to define with accuracy how and why this origin takes place in order that we may thwart or circumvellt the corlditions If it is the result of evolution through a long series of changesy it behooves us to study the normal and to watch and record all the gradations by which the unfriendly result is attained so that at some stage we may intercept the progressive and threatening changes that are occurring or ascertain what condition of the per son or what condition of surroundings constitutes the influence which brings about the change or provides the fertilizing medium for the disease and causes it to break forth If it is the result of a hybridism which occurs spontaneously or rapidly we need to study precisely what forms of vegetative life thus incline to coalesce un der what condition the union occurs and how their conjunctionS development and fertility are to be interrupted If special conditions of some partsas the throat for instancep or certain conditions of the secretions furnish a special soil or culturefluid for the propagation of low forms of vegetative life this is to be studied with exactness In each of these lines the same method of technical study and close record and analysis of facts by competent observers which has prevailed in the study of minute plantlife by botanists and which has obtained in many other sciences will In this compara tively new field of biological and botanical research accomplish equally valuable results In it we are attempting to find out how much and under what circumstances microorganisms imperil human life The practical value of such an inquiry is apparent for sooner than is the case with most of the studies of natureS the results will be applicable in the prevention and treatment of disease It will be a great gain if we can come to know that either under the laws of evolution or as the result of admixture or hybridism symptoms and pathological effects become specialized so as to constitute a new disease which maintains its type As examples of how proximity of different diseases miay modify symptoms we have many suggestive facts in the history of disease Yellowfever is believed by many to be a mongrel born on the high seas by admixture of the junglefever of Africa with the typhus of the pentup hold of the filthy vessel It is not certain that typhoid fever was not once nearer to typhus until it came to be called ab dominal typhus and then to have modifications becatlse surround ings and the acquired power of selfpropagation gave it an autollomy of its own It is not even now certain that there are not grades of cesspool and other adynamic fevers that will some day cleclare another well marked departure from what we now call typhoidy and come to have an individuality of their own It is not certairu that when Sydenham treated scarletfever and measles as one disease their lines of difference were as well marked as now Diphtheria so often seems to have a localized origin and com mon forms of sore throat are so often seen to pass away from their general into a special type that it will not be strange if we can come to the law of departure see views expressed in the SaviZary RecordS of Aug I5 I887 p 88 and the contribution of Ir Wor din in the CornecSicvS SaSe HeaPh ReMorS for I887t that diph theria results from the special virulence of a micrococcus which is not specific put present in forms of foul or septic sore throat While typhomalarial fever has no pathognomonic lesion to dis tinguish it from the ordinary typhoid yet we do know it has symp toms to distinguish it The advances of biological investigation have put us in regions of new possibilities that do not involve spontaneous generation but yet do render probable what is equiva series of changes has been evolved by environment by conditions in persons or in surroundings until the result of some of these changes becomes selfassertive and prevails over its heredity so as to secure for a longer orshorter period a fixity of its own This fixity may be a new disease II The history of hybrids the socalled accidents of their occur rence and the fertility of hybrids are such that we are forced to look upon them as new forms of life  as becoming established into an autonomy or individuality of their own The horticulturist in some of the wonderful productions of new plants in the last score of years has come to be familiar with hy bridisms that wholly obscure origin and that come to have a fixity of their own as much as some new diseases with which we have to deal or as much as cases of disease which we cannot trace to a contagious source All this has been greatly emphasized by what we have come to know as the fertility of hybrids Not over thirty years ago the gen eral view of botanists was that hybrids were sterile But so numer ous are the exceptions and so abundant have been the results of new cultivations that this view is fully disproven Says a recent botanical authority  Among plallts there are many instances of hybrids between species being perfectly fertile and continuing so for an indefinite period Experiments during the last twentyfive years have increased the number of such fertile crosses manifold Fertility of hybrid plants is the rule and sterility the ex ception So far as plants are concerned there is not the slightest ground for considering sterility as a distinctive bar separating species These hybrids come to have a specificity of their own so different from the parentage as to be unrecognizable and so special ized as to be permanent As another expresses it  The hybrid becomes an individual not responsible to its species Nor is this confined to plants with spores Some of our most skilful horticulturists are now producing varieties of ferns by hybrid ism and every now and then some socalled chance growth or sport shows wide departures The bearing of all this on the parasitic forms of disease is not far to seek If as now seems so nearly proven so much of disease has to do with elementary and minute forms of vegetative life it is easy to see how the facts of evolution and hybridism have a bearing upon the appearance and propagation of disease The light of the botanical world and its marvellous revelations as to the actualities and possibilities of the origination of new forms distinct from the parentage penetrates the hidden sphere of diseaseorigin and shows how some diseases cease how others arise how some lapse back to their heredity while others are made permanent or special ized by their environment and how others still are hybridized into specific forms and acquire a fertility and fixity of their own This range of deviation is so wide as to account for very many of the anomalies of disease and for the organization cessation or modi fication of form In reply to my inquiry on this particular point Mr Mehan the distinguished botanist of Germantown Penn writes me  All hybrids that we know by actual experiment are hybrids are fertile as far as I know and reproduce their originals just the same as if they were  original  species I think almost every botanist of note believes in abundant fertile hybrids in nature Coming down nearer to your own line of thought I believe it is conceded that all lichens are hybrids between fungi and alga It is tenable that new forms of disease are continually coming into existence which can only arise from new forms of diseaseproducing plants micro scopic fungi being evolved from older species but I do not know whether there is an opinion that these new forms are the result of hybridization or of that natural law of change which seems to be a constituent part of existencein vegetation at least In a paper read by Dr M W Taylor before the Epidemio logical Society of London April I3 I887 he notes the fact that many of the fungoid varieties were but 4 conversions of elementary states of pencillium and oidium It is also maintained by Zopf the botanist that there may be a pleomorphism amid pathogenic microorganisms and that there are stages of intermediate forms resulting from the nature of the nutrient media see LrceZ May 7 I887 pp 933 934 The view is we believe gaining ground that harmless microDECEMBER I 6 I 88 7 SCIENCE 29I lent to the de xovo origin of cases of disease which afterward are chiedy communicated by the first and succeeding cases Having settled that such origins do take place we shall then pry into the secret of the laws of combinations and the conditions which favor the evil evolution or the facts of hybridism and seek to combat these by starting similarprocesses in opposite directions or by sterilization neutralization disinfection and all the details of radical sanitation Such a view of the occurrence of old or new diseases and of the reasons for fixity in some and changing for1ns and types in othersy leads to several practical results I The study of parasites or germs as they are called is only one of the methods of informing ourselves as to the phenomena of disease and in itself is not likely to be the key to rational and suc cessful treament 2 Our attention should be directed far more than now to the study of conditions and circumstances under which new fornls ap pear to the influence of persons and surroundings instead of to the mere finding of a specific form The latter would of course be most valuable as one of the facts in the chain of evidence but we should not as now seek so much to look to it as the cause of klisease as to inquire what conditions have caused this or that par ticular microphyte to be present 3 We should be able to account for the occasional occurrence of a disease independent of any previous case and for changing types of disease and new diseases and would come to treat diseases less 7sy their names and more in view of their type and the effect of surroundings upon them 4 The tendency of all this is to magnify the importance of close observation and to lead us to feel that success in warding off dis ease and irl treating it when it appears depends mostly uporl close observation and that experience which is derived from actual practice If w e are looking to the biological laboratory for the natural history f disease or to the chemical laboratory for the application of rem edies we shall surely fail It is not so much that we need to find the specific germ or the specific methods The worXd is always looling after specifics But the science and art of sanitation has far more to expect from a study of the conditions of persons and surroundings under which diseases or types and modifications of disease manifest themselves as also from a study of the prevention or obliteration of such conditions than it has to expect from the finding of microphytes as the source of disease and seeking to cure disease by expelling microorganisms or attenuating them Our only design in this paper is to awaken inquiry as to modes of accounting for the localized origin of disease without any antecedent case on the proposition that the laws of evolution envi ronlnent hybridism ormodification by culture give rise to diseases so different from their prototypes as to have individuality and per manency of their own Because such inquiry is relevant to prevention there is good reason to believe that by ascertaining the laws of these transforma tions alad modifications of type and of the origination of special qtarieties we shall ere long find new means for the prevention or limitation of many diseases sThe Malarial Germ of Laveran  was the title of a paper read l3y Dr William T Councilman of Baltimore He considers that this organism probably belongs to the ProZozoa a group of unicell ular organisms noted for the varied changes of form which the individual examples undergo in the course of development Of the malarial germ there are ten more or less distinct formsy of which fivfe are a1M7ays found in intermittentfever During the chill of the fever a definite form is seen in which multiplication takes place 7y segmentation One form has actively moving filaments This was found in blood taken from the spleen in ten cases of malarial cachexia and in five cases of intermittentfever Dr Councilman says tthat too much importance cannot be assigned to this organism as a leans of making a differential diagnosis between malarialfever and typhoidfever In outbreaks of fever which occur in small countrytowns where it is of the greatest importance that the char acter of the disease should be recognized promptly the advantage ofthis mode of diagnosis is most evident There is too much reason for believing that in localities where malarialfevers prevail epidemics of typhoidfever are frequently mistaken for fevers of a malarial type Mr H Lomb of Rochester offered prizes of 500 and 200 for the best essays on practical sanitaryand economic

surfacetemperatures of the oceanswhich have recently been published throw a new light on this complicated lqhenomenon The maps accompanying the present number of Science have been constructed according to Dr O Irummels maps showing the surfacetemperatures of the oceans As the Arctic Ocean must be considered part of the Atlantic of which it forms the most northern extremity it was desirable to in clude it in the map Besides this the Antarctic Ocean exerts a great influence upon the southern part of the Atlantic Ocean and therefore the latter has also been included in the map which shows twothirds of the earths surface in a perspective projection The lateral parts however have been left off as they do not belong to the system of the Atlantic Ocean The Pacific Ocean has been constructed in the same way the map extending from its northern limits to the entrance of the Atlantic Ocean The latter map makes it very clear that the Pacific Ocean forms a comparatively welldefined basin connected by narrow straits with the basin of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans Its southern limit is indicated by the east coast of Australia Wilkes Land Graham Land and the southern portion of America A glance at the lines showing the surfacetemperatures of the oceans reveals the remarkable fact that the warm water is accumulat ed in the western parts of the oceans Krummel designates water of more than 24Q C 75 F as  tropical water In August the belt of such water is 2I degrees of latitude wide in the eastern part of the Atlantic while it occupies 6I on its western side In February it iS 22 degrees wide in the eastern part while it is 56 degrees wide in the western In the Pacific Ocean it does not occupy more than I7 degrees in August and 25 degrees in February while in the western parts its width is 57 degrees and 49 degrees respectively In comparing the amount of tropical and extratropical water Irummel finds that twentynine per cent of the whole surface of the oceans has always a temperature of more than 25Q C while almost onehalf of it temporarily attains this temperature It will be observed that in certain parts of the oceans the lines of equal temperature are much crowded and show sharp angles This is entirely due to currents which carry warm water to high latitudes and cold water to warmer regions Thus the influence of the Agulhas current may be observed in the sharp angles of these lines near the Cape of Good Hope while the cold Cape Horn current lowers the temperature along the eastern coast of South America The influence of the Gulf Stream may be seen in the crowding of the lines of equal temperature near Newfoundland The accumulation of warm water in the western parts of the oceans is entirely due to the action of the tradewinds which blow continually from the eastward and drive the warm water of the ocean westward where it is accumulated on the coasts of the conti nent Buchanan has explained this phenomenon in a paper on similarities

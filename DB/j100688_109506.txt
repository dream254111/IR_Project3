Tympani of the Ear Abstract,i207043,10 probability of an analogy between the colours of a thin plate and the sounds of a series of organpipes and observes that the same colour recurs whenever the thickness of the plate answers to the terms of an arithmetical progression in the same manner as the same sound is produced by means of an uniform blast from organpipes which are different multiples of the same length 11 Of the Coalescence of Musical SoundsIn this section Dr Smiths assertion that the vibrations constituting different sounds are able to cross each other in all directions without affecting the same individual particles of air by their joint forces is minutely investi gated and controverted 12 Of the Frequency of Vibrations constituting a given Note 13 Of the Vibrations of Chords 14 Of the Vibrations of Rods and Plates Of the contents of these three sections no account will be here at tempted as they consist chiefly of experiments and demonstrations illustrated by diagrams 15 Of the Human VoiceA technical description is here given of the formation of sounds by the configuration and inflexions of the different parts of the vocal organ And it is intimated that by a close attention to the harmonics entering into the constitution of various sounds much more may be done in their analysis than could other wise be expected 16 Of the Temperament of Musical IntervalsAfter pointing out some imperfections in most of those who have treated this subject before him the author suggests his own method of distributing the imperfection of the scale so as to produce a modulation that shall be found the least defective And here he observes as upon an average of all music ever composed some particular keys occur at least twice as often as others there seems to be a very strong reason for making the harmony the most perfect in those keys which are the most fre quently used since the aggregate sum of all the imperfections which occur in playing must by this means be diminished the most pos sible and the diversity of the character at the same time accurately preserved Observations on the Effects which take place from the Destruction of the Membrana Tympani of the Ear By Mr Astley Cooper In a Letter to Everard Home Esq FRS by whom some Remarks are added Read Feb 6 1800 Phil Trans 1800 p 151 The case to which we owe the observations contained in this paper is that of a youth who at the age of ten was attacked with an in flammation and suppuration in the left ear which continued dis charging matter for several weeks and who after the space of about a twelvemonth had the same symptoms in his right ear the discharge in both cases being thin and fetid and conveying many small bones and particles of bones On probing the ears when the youth was about twenty years of age it was found that the membrana tympani11 of the left ear was totally destroyed and that but a small part of it remained in the right ear So free was the passage through both the ears that the patient by closing his nostrils and contracting his cheeks could with ease force the air from the mouth through the meatus auditorius and yet what is most remarkable the sense of hearing was by no means materially impaired by this imperfection especially in the left ear where the whole of the membrane was dis solved The organ even retained a nice musical discrimination From this and another similar instance here described it is in ferred that the loss of the membrana tympani though it somewhat diminishes the power of hearing does not absolutely destroy it and that probably where this membrane is wanting its functions are supplied by the membranes of the fenestrse ovalis and rotunda which being placed over the water of the labyrinth will when agitated by the impressions of sound convey their vibrations to that fluid in a similar manner as is done by the membrana tympani in its healthy state It is also intimated that the principal use of this membrane is probably to moderate the impressions of sound and to proportion them to the powers and modifications of the organ Mr Home by whom this paper was communicated has been pleased to add some additional remarks on the mode of hearing in cases where the membrana tympani has been destroyed from which we collect that this membrane appears to him to be chiefly intended to give an extended surface capable of communicating to the small bones the impressions made upon it which a membrane would be in capable of doing unless it had a power of varying its tension to adapt it to different vibrations and that this membrane being destroyed there can be little doubt that the impressions of the vibrating air are produced on the stapes from whence they are communicated to the cavity of the tympanum and thence to the internal organ These remarks are added in order to reconcile the present case with the doctrine laid down by Mr Home in his late paper on the organ of hearing Experiments and Observations on the Light which is spontaneously emitted with some degree of Permanency from various Bodies By Nathaniel Hulme MD FRS and AS Read Feb 13 1800 Phil Trans 1800 p 161 The light which is the object of the present inquiry must be distin guished not only from that which we derive from the sun but also from the brightness exhibited by artificial phosphori electricity me teors and other lucid emanations The principal bodies which afford the light here treated of are 1 Some vegetable and earthy sub stances such as rotten wood and peat earth 2 Marine animals some in a living state viz the Medusa phosphorea the Pholas the Pennatula phosphorea and the Cancer fulgens and most of the marine fishes soon after they are deprived of life 3 Animal flesh in general some time after the extinction of life And 4 Among

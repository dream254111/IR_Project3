stroke adopted by CorneIl for short races The friends of the latter deny this and state that their crew left America in fine condition having beaten Henley time on their own Cayuga Lake course that they continued in excellent condition on this side the Atlantic making in trial races the best records of the season Their best figure for 1 mile 550 yards was 7 m 41 sec as against Leanders 7 m 14 sec Trinity finally beat them in 7 m 15 sec easily al though the Yankees held the lead for half the course In the last two weeks of their stay the Cornell crew had suffered from the enervating effect of the unaccus tomed climate and suddenly lost their stay ing power The event was anticipated by those who watched them most closely days before the races The men themselves say they have lost no faith in boats stroke or coaching system and when in condition are ready to meet any crew which appeared at Henley They had made better time and held their speed on much longer courses The matter has some scientific interest and even importance Improved oarsman ship means much outside athletic circles There is certainly a stroke of maximum ef ficiency which will with a stated expendi ture of muscular power give the greatest possible work in the line of the boats keel It is this really important problem that is likely now to be solved on our home waters for no change is likely to occur on British waters Yale and Cornell will per haps finally settle the question by fighting to a conclusion at home The London Times has been recently pub lishing letters from its correspondent at Kiel in

engaged with Sir John Lubbock Lord Rayleigh and other dis tinguished men of science in a movement having for its object the erection of a me morial to the late Professor Huxley whose death on the 29th ultimo was a source of grief to all scientific men and many divines as well on both sides of the Atlantic R H T LONDON July 16 1895 SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS FOSSIL MAMMALS OF PATAGONIA DR FLORENTINO AMEGHINO of La Plata has recently published an important pamph let Sur les ongules fossiles de lArgentine which includes an exhaustive criticism of the recent memoirs of Mr Lydekker en titled A Study of the Extinct Ungulates of Argentina recently noticed in SCIENCE Dr Ameghino goes over Mr Lydekkers work page by page and points out a num ber of grave errors arising from the fact that the author confined his studies entirely to the collections in the National Museum and did not examine the very rich private collection of Dr Ameghino We noted as a special feature of Mr Lydekkers hand some memoirs that the English and Span SCIENCE 158SCIENCE ish texts are placed in parallel columns Dr Ameghino shows that the Spanish trans lation is full of errors and frequently directly contradicts the statements made in the English text Most of the criticisms seem to be thoroughly justified In con clusion Dr Ameghino says It only re mains for Mr Lydekker to recommence his work with more deliberation and more material If he should decide to do this I offer him my assistance without any refer ence to his previous oversight of my re searches My collection of fossil mammals of Argentina contains about 750 species represented by 50000 specimens which I place at his disposal with all the accom panying catalogues and notes IT is very significant that the most strik ing studies in paleontology at the present time are among the Theromora or mam malianlike reptiles which Professor Seely is describing from South Africa and among this rich true mammalian fauna of South America Both the South American and South African continents terminate at pres ent in restricted land areas but both give evidence of a highly varied and rich land vertebrate fauna in Mesozoic and early Ter tiary times These facts alone point to a far greater former extension of these land areas and even to extensive connections of the southern continents similar to those which existed in former times between the northern continents Dr Ameghino has referred a large number of the Pat agonian mammals to the Marsupialia and they certainly present many striking re semblances to the Australian marsupials but none which appear to us absolutely demonstrative of marsupial descent A STILL later bulletin from Dr Ameghino contains a notice of the  Pyrotherium Beds  which were discovered in 1888 in western Patagonia in the province of Neuquen The last expedition made by M Carlos 159 Ameghino was especially directed to de termining the geological and faunal char acters of this formation From the geolog ical point of view the results obtained are of the greatest importance The Pyrotherium beds are of lacustrine origin and lie in a vast cretaceous basin which is full of re mains of Dinosauria At several points these beds are found to underlie the Pata gonian deposits which are generally con sidered contemporaneous with our lower Miocene The region where the beds are exposed is very similar to that of the Rocky Mountain lake basins absolutely desert deeply eroded and almost everywhere so dry that it is necessary to transport the water supply long distances by muleback The most abundant and characteristic mammal of these beds is Pyrotherium It is referred by Dr Ameghino to a suborder of ungulates which he considers as the di rect source of the Proboscidia If this large mammal had been found in Europe or Asia no one would have hesitated to re gard it as uniting the characteristics of the Dinotherium and Mastodon The struc ture of the lower teeth of the mandible and of the femur is purely proboscidian the astragalus however is of a profoundly dif ferent type and to a certain degree is com parable to that of the marsupials He con siders that the Pyrotheria represent a group of ungulates which have relations to the marsupials but none the less represent the ancestors of the Proboscidia It is impos sible to accept such a conclusion and it seems difficult to determine from Dr Ame ghinos figures whether this large mammal represents a gigantic marsupial related to the kangaroo or whether it is the long sought placental ancestor of the Pro boscidia It presents a single pair of lower incisors like those of the diprotodont mar supials but also somewhat similar to those of the oldest types of Mastodon such as M angustigenis AUGUST 9 1895N S VOL II No 32 COMPARATIVE NEUROLOGY WE have just received Dr Ludwig Ed ingers Bericht iiber die Leistungen auf dem Gebiete der Anatomie des Centralnervensys tems 1893 1894 Schmidts Jahrbicher d Ges Medicin These reviews began in 1885 and the rapid advance of comparative neurology is well indicated by the 345 titles in the present Bericht Dr Edinger sums up the present tendencies of research as follows  It is a special subject of congratulation that investigations are increasing upon the anatomy of the simpler types of brains and upon certain fibre tracts in the lower orders of mammals in which these tracts are much better displayed than in the higher mammalia which have been chiefly investi gated hitherto In general as a result of this work we have gained a deeper insight and have placed the relations of certain tracts upon a firmer comparative basis The admirable method of Marchi has come into more frequent use than heretofore especially in the study of secondary degen eration in the hemispheres in the thalami crura cerebri and a great many new facts have thus been brought out Study upon the olfactory fibre tracts has been renewed with great success after a long interval in which these tracts have been somewhat neglected in fact research in this region was completely stagnant until the discovery of the  glomerular structure finally made it possible to determine the separate regions of the olfactory system more accurately This discovery also made it possible to unify the results obtained in comparative anatomy and to separate a distinct portion of the forebrain with its tracts as part of the olfactory apparatus proper This dis covery also threw new light upon the de velopment of the mantle of the hemispheres a region in which far more progress has been made since it has been found that there are certain clearly defined cortical regions with as clearly defined anatomical relations  Numerous researches upon the arrange ment of the cells in special  nuclei of the nervous system give a constantly increas ing insight into their finer structure It should also be specially noticed that dur ing the last two years has been renewed the study of the changes which take place in the ganglion cells during periods of function and rest in old age death and in disease Here is also a field which promises very rich results   With the above grounds for satisfaction I still cannot let the report of this year go by without expressing a re gret for the custom which seems to be con stantly increasing of rapidly publishing isolated and small observations while longer and more thorough researches are becoming more infrequent It would be a serious blow to this branch of research which has hitherto been followed with sci entific exactness if the large number of hastily prepared researches of beginners should gain the preponderance My warn ing is especially directed against conclusions of a farreaching character which are founded upon a limited number of observa tions  THE AMERICAN MICROSCOPICAL SOCIETY THE eighteenth annual meeting of the Society will be held at Cornell University Ithaca N Y for three days beginning on the morning of August 21st The accom modations afforded by the University build ings and their equipment for carrying on all lines of microscopical work add very materially to the attractiveness of Ithaca as a place of meeting Add to this the richness of both terrestrial and aquatic fauna and flora and it is almost an ideal place both to the student of natural history and to those who love beautiful scenery A large and influential local committee with Professor W W Rowlee as chairman has 160 SCIENCESCIENCE been formed and everything will be done within its power that will contribute to the comfort and enjoyment of the members and

international congress for the protec tion of birds useful in agriculture was held recently in Paris attended by delegates from France Great Britain Germany Aus tria Russia Switzerland Holland Italy Greece and Spain The congress defined the birds injurious and useful to agriculture and requested all the nations taking part in the congress should pass within three years AUGUST 9 1895N S VOL II No 32 laws absolutely protecting useful birds They are to be neither killed nor taken alive under any circumstances ACCORDING to The Lancet the number of cases treated gratuitously in the London clinics rose from about two and ahalf mill ions in 1890 to more than four millions in 1894 As FAR as can be judged from the cable dispatches the topic which attracted most attention at the International Geog raphical Congress was polar exploration A resolution was passed affirming that the greatest geographical exploration yet to be undertaken was to be pursued in Antarctic fields in view of great additions to geog raphical knowledge which must result from such exploration It was therefore recom mended that the assembled scientific soci eties throughout the world urge in what ever way seems to them most effective that this work be undertaken before the close of the century The Congress adopted the reso lution of the VicePresidents recommending Berlin as the place for the meeting of 1896 PROF S J BROWN of the United States Naval Observatory has been sent on a mission with instructions to visit the obser vktories at Greenwich Paris and Berlin and report to the department on their oper

Dr C E Stroud Sandusky Ohio THE revised edition of von Helmholtzs great work  Handbuch der physiologischen Optik is now approaching completion the 12th part having just been issued The publication of the new edition was begun in 1885 but proceeded slowly von Helmholtz being occupied with other work The eighth part was issued in 1894 but since the death of von Helmholtz four parts have been published under the editorship of Prof Arthur Konig The part now issued con tains sections on binocular vision on rivalry of the fields of vision and the beginning of a discussion on the psychological theories of binocular vision MR JOHN K HILLERS photographer of the Geological Survey has prepared under the supervision of Mr Charles D Walcott Director of the Survey a collection of pho tographic transparencies for the Atlanta Exposition A NUMBER of transfers and promotions have been made in the Weather Bureau by order of Secretary Morton among which we may note that Edward E Gerriot has been placed in charge of the Station at Chi cago with a salary of 2500 per annum succeeding Willis N Moore now Chief of theWeather Bureau and that Mr Alexander McAdie has been transferred from Washing ton to San Francisco The Literary Digest is doing excellent work in the popularization of science by publishing each week four pages which con tain abstracts and quotations selected and edited with much skill in reference to the more generally interesting aspects of sci entific progress ACCORDING to the WashingtonStar a new departure has been made in the publication work of the Agricultural Department Hereafter it will call upon specialists in certain lines of agricultural work though not connected with the office to make in vestigations of importance to agricultural interests and to prepare brief papers or articles embracing the results of the work These will be paid for at rates which the Department regards as reasonable the funds being provided for in the Congressional ap

1st at the age of 78 years UNIVERSITY AND EDUCATIONAL NEWS THE Berlin correspondent of the New York Evening Post states that there are an unusually large number of American stu dents now studying in Germany 109 Americans are matriculated in the Univer sity of Berlin and there are a large number of others pursuing special studies in clinics and other institutions The total number of American students in the German uni versities is estimated at 340 it is said that in some of the laboratories nearly half the research work is being done by American students The fact that the Summer Se mester in Germany continues in session until the first of August gives American students an excellent opportunity to become acquainted with German university life and methods without interrupting their academic course at home The number of American students study ing in Germany far exceeds the number studying in France This is partly owing to the fact that the German university is more liberal in the admission of foreign students and in the conferring of degrees A meeting has however recently been held at the Sorbonne under the presidency of M Gr6ard with a view to making modifica tions in the rules governing the conferment of academic degrees and other regulations so that more foreign students may be attracted to Paris WE learn from the Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau that Dr Fr Richart

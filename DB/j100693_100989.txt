IN THIN 4 THE ARGUMENT THE TITLE DECLARES TO BE THE SAME WITH THAT IN THE GEOMETRY OF THE FAMOUS DESCARTES VIZ THAT ANCIENT PROBLEME OF FINDING TWO MEANS OR DOUBLING THE CUBE L L L L 2 WHICH904 WHICH TROUBLED ALL GREECE THE SOLUTION OF WHICH PROBLEME IN GEOMETRY MAY BE COMPARED TO THAT WITH THE GIVING OF THE CUBEROOT OF ANY NUMBER PROPOSED IN ARITHMETICK FOR IN ARITHMETICK THE FIRST OF TWO CONTINUAL PROPORTIONALS BETWEEN AN UNIT AND ANY NUMBER PROPOSEDIS THE CUBEROOT OF THAT NUM BERAND THE UNIT IN ARITHMETICK IS REPRESENTED BY A LINE IN GEO METRYWHICH IS ONE OF THE EXTREAMS CONCERNING THIS PROBLEME THE AUTHOR DECLARES HIMSELF TO BE NONE OF THOSE THAT SEARCH FOR THAT WHICH CANNOT BE FOUNDTO WIT TO PERFORM IT BY RIGHT LINES AND A CIRCLE TIS TRUE INDEED IT MAY BE SO DONE TO WIT BY TRYALS AND PROFERS AS WHO CANNOT IN THAT MANNER DIVIDE AN ARCH INTO THREE EQUAL PARTS BUT SUCH MECHA NISMES ARE ACCOUNTED AGEOMETRICK AND SUCH OPERATIONS MAY BE WELL RESEMBLED TO THE VULGAR RULE OF FALSE POSITION IN ARITHME TICK WHICH CANNOT GIVE AN ABSOLUTE TRUE RESOLUTION OF ONE OF THE MEANEST OF QUESTIONS WHEN THE THING SOUGHT IS MULTIPLEX OF IT SELF OR INVOLVED FOR INSTANCE WHAT NUMBER IS THAT WHICH MULTIPLYED IN IT SELF MAKES 9 WHO KNOWETH IT NOT TO BE 3 BUT WHO CAN FIND IT TO BE ABSOLUTELY SO BY THE AID OF THE ORDINARY RULES OF FALSE POSITION WHEREIN THE EXTRACTION OF A SQUARE ROOT IS NOT PRESCRIBED THE AUTHOR OBSERVES THAT AMONGST THOSE THAT SOLVE THIS PRO BLEME BY THE CONICK SECTIONS THEY SEEM TO HAVE AFFORDED FEWER EFFECTIONS THEREOF THAN THERE HAVE BEEN AGES SINCE IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED VERY FEW BY AYD OF A CIRCLE AND AN HYPERBOLA OR PARA BOLA BY A CIRCLE AND ELLIPSIS NONE THAT HE COULD OBSERVE TO HAVE BEEN PUBLISHED THE WHICH THE AUTHOR CONSIDERING AND STUDYING HOW TO SUPPLYHE FOUND OUT NOT ONELY ONE BUT INFINITE SUCH EFFECTIONS AND THAT NOT IN ONE METHODBUT MANY FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE OF WHICH METHODS BY THE LIKE FELICITY HE HATH CONSTRUCTED ALL SOLID PROBLEMS INFINITE WAYS BY A CIRCLE AND AN ELLIPSIS OR HY PERBOLA 1 HIS GENERAL METHODS FOR FINDING TWO MEANS BY A CIRCLE AND EITHER AN HYPERBOLA OR ELLIPSIS ARE LAID DOWN IN PROP 1 2 16 AND IN THIS 16 PROP HE SHEWETH TO DO IT WITH ANY ELLIPSIS AND A CIRCLE 2 PARTICULAR EFFECTIONS FOR FINDING BUT ONE OR BOTH OF THE MEANS905 MEANS AND DOUBLING THE CUBE IN PROP 3 TO 6 3 AND ALAEIT ALL CUBICK AEQUATIONS MAY BE SOLVED EITHER BY THE FINDING OF TWO MEANS OR THE TRISECTION OF AN ANGLE YET HE SHEWS THE EXTENT OF HIS METHOD IN FINDING OUT OTHER INFINITE WAYS FOR THE DOING THEREOF FROM PROP7TO 12 4 THE TRISECTION OF AN ANGLE BY A CIRCLE AND HYPERBOLA PROP 13 AND BY A PARABOLA IN STEAD THEREOFPROP15 AND THE FINDING OF TWO MEANS BY A CIRCLE AND PARABOLA PROP 14 IN THE SECOND PART OF HIS BOOK DE ANALYSI THE AUTHOR FIRST GIVES YOU THE ANALYSIS OR ALGEBRA WHEREBY ALL HIS GENERAL ME THODS OF FINDING TWO MEANS WERE INVENTED AND AFTERWARDS FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF GEOMETRY GIVES YOU THE ANALYSIS THAT RE LATES TO HIS PARTICULAR METHODS AS IN CASE YOU WOULD FIND BUT ONE OF THOSE MEANS AND AFTERWARDS BY AN EASIE OPERATION THE OTHER AFTER THATHE COMES TO SHEW HOW THE EFFECTIONS OR DELINEATIONS FOR CUBICK AEQUATIONS WERE INVENTED AND THEN HOW THOSE CONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE TRISECTION OF AN ANGLE WERE FOUND OUT THE USE WHEREOF IS TO GIVE LINES IN A KNOWN MEASURE EQUAL TO THE QUANTITYS SOUGHT WHEREBY EITHER TO GIVE AID IN THE EASIE OBTAI NING THE FIRST AND SECOND FIGURES OF THE ROOT OR CONTROUL THE SAME LASTLY HE COMES TO TREAT OF GENERAL CONSTRUCTIONS FOR THE RE SOLVING OF ALL SOLID PROBLEMS WITHOUT REDUCTION OF THE AEQUA TIONSPROPOSED AND SHEWETH A GENERAL CONSTRUCTION FOR ALL CU BICK AND BIQUADRATICK AEQUATIONS BY AYD OF A CIRCLE AND A PARA BOLA LETTING ORDINATES FALL FROM THE POINTS OF INTERSECTION ON SOME DIAMETER OF THE PARABOLA WHICH IS ALWAYS PARALLEL TO THE AXIS WHEREAS DES CHARTES LETTING THOSE ORDINATES ALWAYS FALL UP ON THE AXIS WAS FORCED TO PREPARE AND ALTER THE AEQUATIONS BY DRIVING OUT OR TAKING AWAY THE SECOND TERM WHICH IS NEXT THE HIGHEST THAT THE SUM OF THE NEGATIVE ROOTS MIGHT BE EQUAL TO THE SUM OF THE AFFIRMATIVE ONES AS HIS CONSTRUCTIONS ALWAYS RE QUIRE BUT

MOTION BOTH IN THE RADIUS AND CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE CIRCLE THAT STEPHANO ANGELI HATH DONE THE LIKE WHEN THE MO TION IN THE RADIUS IS EQUAL BUT IN THE CIRCUMFERENCE ACCORDING TO ANY DEGREE OF ACCELERATION WHICH GAVE HIM OCCASION TO RENDER THIS DOCTRINE EASIE AND UNIVERSAL BY REDUCING IT TO ONE ANALYSIS WHEN THE MOTION IS ACCELERATE ACCORDING TO ANY DEGREE EITHER IN THE RADIUS OR CIRCUMFERENCE AND HENCE RESOLVES THIS PROBLEME IN CIRCULO DESCRIBERE SPIRALEM EX TALIBUS MOTIBUS COM POSITUM UT CIRCULUS AD SPATIUM SPIRALE HABEAT RATIONEM DATAM NUMERI AD NUMERUM AND APPLIES THE SAME DOCTRINE IN CHAP3 TO ANOTHER SORT OF INFINITE SPIRALS CHAP 2 HE TREATS DE MENSARA SPATIORUM CURVA  RECTA CON TENTORUM  EORUM CENTRI AEQUILIBRII APPLYING THE FORMER ANA LYSIS OR ALGEBRAICK CALCULATION THERETO CHAP 5 TREATS DE PUNCTO FLEXUS CONTRARII IN CONCHOIDE NICO MEDIS PRIMA WHICH POINT HE DETERMINS BY THE INTERSECTION OF A PARABOLA WHOSE AXIS IS SITUATED IN THE SAME LINE WITH THAT OF THE CONCHOID OR BY A CUBICK PARABOLAWHOSE AXIS IS PARALLEL TO THE BASE OF THE CONCHOIDAND VERTEX THE SAME WITH THE POLE OF THE CONCHOID AND HENCE INVENTS INNUMERABLE OTHER CONCHOIDS OF LIKE PROPERTIES AND FINDS THE CURVE PASSING THROUGH THOSE POINTS OF FLEXURE THAT ARE MADE BY INFINITE CONCHOIDS DESCRIBED ABOUT THE SAME COMMON POLE AND BASE WHICH IN THE COMMON CONCHOIDS HE FINDS TO BE THE PERIMETER OF THE CUBICK PARABOLA HERE MENTIONED BUT IN HIS OWN NEW CONCHOIDS IT IS THE ANTIENT CISSOID EXTENDED BEYOND A QUADRANT AND RUNNING ASYMPTOTICK AND HE FINDS ALSO THE ROUND SOLIDS MADE BY THE ROTATION OF THESE INFINITE CURVES AND OF THE CISSOID LINE ABOUT THEIR BASE LINES OR ASYMPTOTES EQUAL TO FINITE SOLIDS CHAP 6 THE AUTHOR CONSIDERING THAT VINCENZO VIVIANI IN HIS BOOK DE MAXIMIS  MINIMIS FOUND THAT IF THERE WERE IN NUMERABLE PARABOLAS DESCRIBED HAVING THE SAME AXIS AND VERTEX COMMON IF FROM ANY POINT IN THAT AXIS THE SHORTEST LINES WERE DRAWN TO THOSE PARABOLAS ALL THOSE POINTS OF INCIDENCE WOULD FALL IN AN ELLIPSIS AND THE AUTHORS ANALYSIS TAUGHT HIM THAT THE PROP WAS UNIVERSAL WHERESOEVER THE POINT BE ASSIGNED FROM WHICH908 WHICH THE LEAST LINES ARE TO BE DRAWN WHICH HE HATH EXTENDED AND APPLYED TO THOSE INFINITE SORTS OF OTHER PARABOLAS CHAP 7 TREATS DE FIGURARUM DIMENSIONE EX DATO CENTRO AE QUILIBRII THIS HE SAITH IS ACCURATELY HANDLED BY THE LEARNED ALREADY ALIQUOT TAMEN MODOS

9 HE TREATS OF THE CENTER OF GRAVITY OF THE LUNULA OF HIPPOCRATES CHIUS AND SHEWETH THAT IF HIPPOCRATES HAD GIVEN THAT AS HE DID THE QUADRATURE OF THE LUNULA HE HAD SQUARED THE CIRCLE CHAP 10 TREATS OF ARITHMETICAL PROBLEMS WHEREIN HE AS SERTS THAT DIOPHANTUS WAS WONT TO SOLVE ARITHMETICAL QUESTIONS WITH GREAT SUBTILTY BUT USETH NUMBERS ONLY WHEREAS THE SAME MAY OFTEN BE MORE EASILY AND UNIVERSALLY SOLVD BY ALGEBRA AND TAKES FOR EXAMPLES THE THIRD QUESTION OF THE FOURTH BOOKWHICH HE REFORMES AND REDUCETH DIVERS OF THE LIKE KIND THAT BACHET HATH ADDED TO ONE PROPOSITION AND RESOLUTION THE 44TH OF THE FOURTH BOOK OF THE SAME DIOPHANTUS WHICH BEING SOLVED WITH MUCH TROUBLE HE SHEWETH TO HAVE A BRIEFE ANALYSIS THE 13TH OF THE THIRD BOOK AND THE 36TH OF THE FOURTH BOOK BY REASON OF THE LIKENESS OF ITS OPERATION WITH THE FORMER THUS WE HAVE GIVEN AN ACCOUNT OF THE AUTHORS BOOK WHAT REPUTE HE HATH AMONG THE LEARNED NEEDS NOT TO BE INSISTED ON THE FAMOUS PASCHAL OR DETTONVILE IN A LETTER TO THIS AUTHORSAITH TO GIVE IT IN ENGLISH I BELIEVE THAT TO MAKE IT KNOWN THAT TIS YOU WHO HATH FOUND FOR EXAMPLE THIS PARABOLA WHICH IS THE909 THE PLACE THAT GIVES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE SURFACES OF THE SO LIDS OF THE CYCLOID ABOUT THE BASEIT MUST BE I THAT MUST TELL THE WORLD SO AS WELL AS THE OTHER WONDERS OF YOUR NEW ANALYSIS AND SO MANY OTHER THINGS WHICH YOU HAVE DONE ME THE HONOR TO IMPART UNTO ME WITH THAT GOODNESS YOU ARE PLEASD TO HAVE FOR ME C THE BOOK HERE COMMENDED IS THE SECOND EDITION OF THE MESOLABE OF THIS EXCELLENT GEOMETER OUR AUTHOR CONCERNING WHOSE FIRST

JUDGEMENT HERE AND DOUBTLESS IT WILL HAVE THE SAME ESTEEM ELSEWHERE AMONG THE LEARNED THAT IN IT THERE IS THE MOST EXCELLENT ADVANCEMENT MADE IN THIS KIND OF GEOMETRY SINCE THE FAMOUS MATHEMATICIAN AND PHILOSOPHER DES CARTES II TRACTATUS DE CORDE ITEM DE MO TU  COLORE SANGVINIS C A RICHARDO LOWER M D LONDINI IN 80 IMPENSIS JACOBI ALLESTRY 1669 THE LEARNED AUTHOR OF THIS TREATISE A MEMBER OF THE R SOCIETY CONSIDERING WITH HIMSELF HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS FOR THE ATTAINING A FULL KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE AND QUA LITIES OF THE BLOOD TO INVESTIGATE BESIDES THE CIRCULAR MOTION THEREOF THE ORIGIN AND CELERITY OF THAT MOTION AND THE VARIOUS CHANGES THEREOF TOGETHER WITH THE CAUSES OF THEM AS ALSO TO MAKE AN ESTIMATE OF THE QUANTITY OF THAT LIQUOR EMITTED AT EVERY PULSATION THOUGHT IT VERY WELL WORTH WHILE TO GIVE FROM HIS OWN BEST OBSERVATIONS A CLEAR AND PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF THAT WHOLE MATTER AND FOR AS MUCH AS HE CONCEIVES THAT THE MO TION OF THE BLOOD DEPENDS ON THAT OF THE HEART HE BEGINS WITH A DISCOURSE CONCERNING THE SITUATION AND STRUCTURE OF THE HEART TO M M M M SHEW910 SHEW HOW EXACTLY THESE TWO ARE CALCULATED FOR ITS MOTION AND HOW WELL ADAPTED TO DISTRIBUTE THE BLOUD INTO THE PARTS OF THE WHOLE BODY IN THE FIRST CHAPTER THEN HE CONSIDERS THE DIVERSITY OF THE SITUATION OF THE HEART IN DIFFERENT AN MALS AND THE REASON THERE OF PROCEEDING TO DISCOURSE OF THE PERICARDIUM AND ITS USE TOGETHER WITH THE ORIGIN AND VSE OF THE SERUM THEREIN AND WHY IN MAN ONELY THAT CASE OF THE HEART GRO VS TO THE MIDRIFF AND WHAT MAKES IT TO DO SO AS ALSO WHY THE CONE IN AN HUMANE HEART BENDS MUCH MORE TO THE LEFT SIDE THAN IN BRUTES THEN SHEWING THAT ARTERIES HAVE THEIR RISE FROM THE HEARD BUT VEINS TERMINATE IN IT AND HOW AND BY WHAT VESSELS THE HEART IS NOU RISHT BY THE ALIMENTARY JUYCE TREATING ALSO OF THE VESSELS OF THE HEART ITS NERVES AND THE VARIOUS INFLUX OF THE ANIMAL SPIRITS THROUGH THE NERVES INTO THE HEART ACCORDING TO THE VARIOUS SHAPES OF ANIMALS TOGETHER WITH THE CAUSE THEREOF PROVING FURTHER THAT THE SUBSTANCE OF THE HEART IS PERFECTLY MUS CULAR AND IN PERFECTION SURPASSING ALL OTHER MUSCLES OF THE BODY WHERE HE EXSPATIATES INTO UNCOMMON OBSERVATIONS CONCERN ING MUSCLES IN GENERAL THEN DESCENDING TO A MINUTE EXPLICA TION OF THE PARTS OF THE HEART AND THERE PARTICULARLY SHEWING THE MECHANICAL CONTRIVANCE OF THE HEART FOR ITS SYSTOLE AND DIASTOLE TOGETHER WITH AN ACCURATE DESCRIPTION OF THE FORAMEN OVALE AND ITS VSE IN THE FAETUSAND THE CLAUSURE OF THE SAME IN ANIMALS BORN IN THE SECOND CHAPTER HE TREATS OF THE MOTION AND OFFICE OF THE HEART WHEREAS HE ADMITS NOT OF ANY FERMENT OR EOULLITION OF THE BLOUS IN THE HEART WHICH HE AFFIRMS WOULD BE AN OBSTACLE TO ITS SYSTOLE AS TIS NEEDLESS TO THE DIASTOLE SO HE ASSENTS THAT THE MOTION OF THE HEART DEPENDS NOT FROM SUCH AN EOULLITION WHICH HE PROVES BY EXPERIMENTS AND VINDICATES FROM OBJECTIONS BUT THAT THE GENUINE AND IMMEDIATE INSTRUMENTS OF THE HEARTS MO TION ARE ITS FIBRES NERVESAND SPIRITS FLOWING THROUGH THEM THE ACTION OF THE HEART BEING ALTOGETHER CONFORM TO THAT OF OTHER MUSCLES WHERE HE TAKES OCCASION TO MAKE IT OUT THAT THE MO TION OF MUSCLES IS NOT CAUSD BY THEIR BEING INFLATED NOR BY ANY EXPLOSION OF THE SPIRITS PASSING THROUGH THEM BUT AFTER THE MAN NER AS TWO MEN TAKING ONE ANOTHER BY THEIR HANDS DRAW THEM SELVES911 SELVES CLOSE TOGETHER INTO MUTUAL EMBRACES WHENCE HE GOES ON TO SHEW THAT THE WHOLE MOTION OF THE H ART CONSISTS INDEED IN THE SYSTOLE THAT OF THE DIASTOLE BEING ONELY A MOTION OF RESTI TUTION FURTHER THAT THERE IS A NECESSARY COMMERCE BETWIX THE HEART AND BRAIN THE CAUSE OF ALL SENSE AND MOTION BUT THAT BOTH ULTIMATELY DEPEND FROM THE STOMACK AS THE CONSTANT PUR VEYOR AND FURNISHER OF MATTER FOR B OUD AND SPIRITS IN THE THIRD CHAPT HE TEACHETH WITH WHAT CELERITY ALL THE BLOUD PASSETH THROUGH THE HEART AND WHAT DIFFERENCE THERE IS BE TWEEN THE VENAL BLOUD AND THE ARTERIAL AS TO THE FORMER HE CALCULATETH THAT ALL THE BLOUD PASSETH THROUGH THE BODY THIRTEEN TIMES NOT SIX AS TIS MISPRINTED IN THE BOOK IT SELF IN ONE HOUR AND CONCERNING THE LATTER HE IS OF OPINION THAT THE PURPUREOUS AND FLORID COLOR OF THE BLOOD IN THE A TERIES PROCEEDS NOT FROM ITS ACCENSION IN THE HEART IF THERE BE ANY SUCH THING BUT DEPENDS ALTOGETHER FROM THE LUNGS AND THE ADMIXTURE OF THE AIR WITH THE BLOUD THERE WHICH HE PROVETH BY CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTS REFUTING WITHAL THE OPINION OF THOSE THAT WILL DERIVE IT FROM THE COMMINUTION OF THE BLOUD IN THE LUNGS IN THE FOURTH CHAPT HE GIVES AN ACCOMPT OF THE RISE PRO GRESS AND USE OF THE INVENTION OF TRANSFUSING BLOUD OUT OF ONE ANIMAL INTO ANOTHER THOUGH IN THE HISTORY OF THIS PARTICULAR HE COMMITS I KNOW NOT BY WHAT OVERSIGHT A MISTAKE IN RELA TING THAT MONSIEUR DENYS CALLD BY HIM DIONYSIUS ARROGATETH TO HIMSELF THAT INVENTION WHEREAS HE ONELY TELLS US THAT SOME OF HIS NATION DO SO BESIDES WHICH WE MUST NEEDS TAKE NOTICE OF AN OTHER MISTAKE IN THIS PART OF THE BOOK VIZ THAT THE AUTHOR TA KING OCCASION TO SPEAK OF THE PHILOS TRANSACTIONS CALLS THEM THE TRANSACTIONS OF THE SOCIETY WHICH CERTAINLY HE WOULD NOT HAVE CONE IF HE HAD EITHER BUT TAKEN NOTICE OF WHAT IS SAID IN NUMB 11 OF THE SAME OR ELSE CONSIDERD THAT SO ILLUSTRIOUS AND SO LEARND A BODY WOULD CERTAINLY IF THEY THOUGHT FIT TO PUBLISH ANY THING AS THEIRS ENTERTAIN THE KNOWING WORLD BOTH WITH SUB LIMER MATTER AND WITH A SUTABLE ELOQUENCE BUT THIS BY THE BY IN THE FIFTH CHAPT HE TREATS OF THE CHYLE AND ITS CHANGE INTO BLOUD WHERE HE OBSERVETH THAT NOTHING PASSES FROM THE SPLEEN THROUGH THE VASBREVE INTO THE STOMACK BUT THAT THE FERMENT M M M M 2 OF912 OF THE STOMACK PROCEEDS IMMEDIATELY FROM THE BLOOD IT SELF EXPLAINING FURTHER HOW THE SEPARATION OF THE CHYLE IS PERFORMD IN THE JNTESTINS AND HOW THE SAME TO FACILITATE THE MORE ITS PASSAGE IS DILUTED AND REFINED BY THE IUYCE OF THE PANCREAS SE CRETED INTO THE DUODENUM RENDRING ALSO THE CAUSE WHY ALL THE GLANDULS IN THE ABDOMEN AND IN ALL THE LOWER PARTS OF THE BO DY DO DEPOSITE THEIR LYMPHA OR JUYCE INTO THE COMMON GREAT RECEPTACLE OF THE CHYLE AND WHY THAT RECEPTACLE IS PLACD BE TWEEN THE TENDONS OF THE DAPHRAGIME AS ALSO WHY THOSE CHANNELS WHICH CONVEY THE CHYLE INTO THE SUBCLAVIAL VEIN ARE DOUBLE TO WHICH HE ADDS THAT ALL THE CHYLE IS BY THE DUCTUS THORACICUS ALONE TRANSMITTED INTO THE BLOUD AND HEART WHICH HE PROVETH BY SEVERAL CONSIDERABLE EXPERIMENTS WITH SOME REFLEXION ON THE BILSIAN EXPERIMENT ALLEDGED FOR THE CON TRARY ALL WHICH HE CONCLUDES BY SHEWING THE DEGREES AND WAYS OF CHANGE WHEREBY THE CHYLE IS AT LAST CONVERTED INTO BLOUD AND HOW IT SERVETH FOR THE NOURISHMENT AND THE SEVERAL PARTS OF THE BODY THE WHOLE RECEIVES A SINGULAR ELUCIDATION AND ORNAMENT BY THE ACCURATE FIGURES IN 6 TABLES ANNEXED MANY CURIOUS AND IMPORTANT OBSERVATIONS ARE OCCASIONALLY INTERSPERSED SUCH AS ARE THAT THE CAPILLARY VESSELS OF THE SAME SORT DO OPEN INTO ONE ANOTHER IN ALL THE PARTS OF THE BO DY THAT ALL THE MUSCLES OF THE BODY ARE BIVENTERS OR DOUBLE BELLYD THAT AS THE MOTIONOF THE HEART AND BLOUD IS CIRCULAR SO THE FIBRES AS THE MOVING ENGINES OF THEM ARE ABOUT THE CONE OF THE HEART BROUGHT INTO A CIRCLE AND CENTER THAT THE MOTION IN THE MUSCLES IS NOT LIKE SHOOTING BUT FENCING AND MANY MORE FOR WHICH WE MUST REFERR TO THE BOOK IT SELF F I N I S L O N D O N PRINTED BY T N FOR JOHN MARTYN PRINTER TO THE

OBSERVATI ONS OF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE SUN AND FIXED STARS MADE IN A VOYAGE FROM ENGLAND TO THE ISLAND OF ST HELENA IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE LONGITUDE OF THE SHIP FROM TIME TO TIME TOGETHER WITH THE WHOLE PROCESS OF COMPUTATION USED ON THIS OCCASION S I R ST HELENA SEPT 9 1761 DURING THE COURSE OF MY VOYAGE FROM ENGLAND TO THIS PLACE I MADE FREQUENT OBSERVATIONS OF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE SUN AND FIXED STARS IN ORDER TO DETERMINE OUR LONGITUDE AND AS FROM THEIR AGREE MENT WITH EACH OTHER I HUMBLY CONCEIVE IT WILL BE ALLOWED THAT THE LONGITUDE MAY IN GENERAL BE ASCER TAINED BY THIS METHOD TO SUFFICIENT EXACTNESS FOR NAU TICAL PURPOSES I FLATTER MYSELF IT MAY NOT BE DISAGREE ABLE TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IF I COMMUNICATE TO THEM THROUGH YOUR HANDS THE RESULTS OF MY OBSERVATIONS I SHALL LIKEWISE DELIVER THE WHOLE PROCESS OF COMPU TATION WHICH I USE IN DEDUCING THE LONGITUDE FROM AN OBSERVATION WHEREIN I INCLUDE SEVERAL USEFUL RULES OF MY OWN INVESTIGATION WHICH I APPREHEND RENDER THE CALCULATION NOT ONLY MUCH SHORTER BUT ALSO MUCH LESS INTRICATE THAN IT WAS BEFORE READ JUNE 24 AND JULY 1 1762 I AM S I R YOUR MOST OBEDIENT HUMBLE SERVANT NEVIL MASKELYNE559 MY HADLEYS QUADRANT WHICH WAS MADE BY MR BIRD THE RADIUS OF WHICH IS 20 INCHES APPEARS FROM ALL THE TRIALS I HAVE MADE WITH IT TO BE VERY EXACT THIS INDEED THE OBSERVATIONS OF THE MOON ALONE SUFFICIENTLY PROVE SINCE I HAVE OFTEN TAKEN THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM TWO STARS ON DIFFERENT SIDES ON THE SAME NIGHT AND FOUND THE SAME LONGI TUDE TO RESULT FROM THESE SEPARATE OBSERVATIONS WITH AS LITTLE DIFFERENCE AS FROM TWO OBSERVATIONS OF THE SAME STAR WHEREAS IF THERE WAS THE LEAST ERROR IN THE DIVISION OF THE QUADRANT OR THE LEAST REFRACTION IN THE GLASSES OF IT THE ERROR ARISING FROM HENCE AFFECT ING THE COMPUTATION OF THE LONGITUDE FROM THE TWO SEPARATE OBSERVATIONS CONTRARY WAYS MUST BE SENSIBLE IN THE RESULT I WAS SECURED FROM ANY ERRORS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE QUADRANT BY THE KNOWN SKILL OF THE ARTIST AND THE SPECULUMS AS WELL AS DARK GLASSES WERE GROUND BY MR DOLLOND BY A PARTICULAR METHOD OF HIS OWN BY WHICH HE IS CERTAIN OF MAKING THE TWO SURFACES OF A GLASS TRULY PARALLEL TO EACH OTHER THE ARCH AND THE INDEX WERE BOTH OF BRASS AND THE FRAME OF WELL SEASONED MAHOGANY THE VERNIERS SCALE ON THE INDEX CARRIED THE SUBDIVISIONS TO SINGLE MINUTES AND THE EYE MIGHT SUBDIVIDE STILL NEARER TO THE FRACTION OF A MINUTE WHEN THE INDEX WAS BROUGHT NEAR THE PROPER DISTANCE FOR OBSERVATION IN ORDER TO GIVE IT A MORE STEADY MOTION THAN THE HAND ALONE COULD A PLATE WAS SCREWED DOWN TO THE ARCH CONTAINING THE HEAD OF A SCREW BY TURNING OF WHICH THE INDEX WAS CARRIED BACKWARDS OR FORWARDS AT PLEA SURE THIS CONTRIVANCE WAS EXTREMELY NECESSARY FOR TAKING THE DISTANCE OF A STAR FROM THE MOONS LIMB IN VOL LII 4 C AN560 AN EXACT MANNER FOR THE QUADRANT BEING OFTEN TO BE HELD IN A VERY INCLINED PLANE IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOTION OF THE SHIP TO MAKE THE OB SERVATION AT ONCE THEREFORE BY MEANS OF THE SCREW THE INDEX WAS MOVED BY GENTLE DEGREES AND EACH TIME AFTER ALTERING THE SCREW THE QUADRANT WAS TURNED BY THE HAND ROUND THE VISUAL RAY GOING TO THE STAR AS AN AXIS SO AS TO MAKE THE STAR SEEM TO PASS BY THE MOONS LIMB AND THE INDEX WAS GRADUALLY MOVED TILL AT LAST THE STAR IN PASSING BY EXACTLY SWEPT THE MOONS LIMB BESIDES THE SCREW MOVING THE INDEX THERE WAS ANOTHER ADDITION NO LESS NECESSARY WHICH WAS A DARK GLASS MUCH BRIGHTER THAN ANY OF THOSE COMMONLY USED TO TAKE OFF THE EXCESSIVE BRIGHTNESS OF THE MOON AND THAT GLARE UPON THE HORIZONGLASS WHICH ALWAYS ATTENDS IT WITHOUT THE USE OF THIS GLASS IT WAS NOT EASY TO OBSERVE ACCURATELY THE DISTANCE OF A STAR FROM THE MOONS LIMB EXCEPT WHEN THE MOONS LIGHT WAS WEAKENED BY A THIN CLOUD IN ORDER TO RENDER THE CONTACT OF A STAR WITH THE MOONS LIMB MORE DISCERNIBLE I ALWAYS USED A SMALL TELESCOPE MAGNIFYING ABOUT FOUR TIMES EXCEPT WHEN THE MOTION OF THE SHIP WAS VERY TROUBLESOME THOUGH I RECKONED THE OBSERVATIONS WERE NOT QUITE SO EXACT AS THOSE MADE WITH THE TELESCOPE THE TELESCOPE BY MEANS OF TWO SWIVELS ADAPTED TO IT HAD A MOTION PARALLEL TO ITSELF BY WHICH IT WAS CARRIED NEARER TO OR FURTHER FROM THE PLANE OF THE QUADRANT BY MEANS OF WHICH THE MOON WHICH WAS SEEN ALWAYS BY RE FLEXION WAS RENDERED MORE OR LESS BRIGHT ACCORDING AS MORE OR LESS OF HER LIGHT WAS RECEIVED BY THE TELE SCOPE FROM THE QUICKSILVERED PART OF THE OBJECT SPE CULUM OR BY RAISING THE TELESCOPE STILL HIGHER FROM I THE561 THE PLANE OF THE QUADRANT THE MOON WAS SEEN ENTIRELY BY REFLEXION FROM THE UNSOILED PART OF THE SPECULUM WHICH I GENERALLY FOUND TO BE THE MOST CONVENIENT FOR MY PART I SHOULD ALWAYS RECOMMEND THE USING OF A SMALL TELESCOPE MAGNIFYING ABOUT THREE TIMES AS IT WOULD MAKE THE OBJECTS APPEAR MORE DISTINCT AND REN DER THE CONTACT OF THE STAR WITH THE MOONS LIMB MORE EVIDENT MY TELESCOPE WHICH WAS ABOUT 6 INCHES LONG CON SISTED OF TWO CONVEX GLASSES SO THAT IT INVERTED OB JECTS WHICH IS OF NO SORT OF INCONVENIENCE TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN USED TO INVERTING TELESCOPES THE PRAC TISE OF WHICH IS SOON ACQUIRED BUT IF ANY ONE WOULD RATHER CHUSE TO HAVE A TELESCOPE THAT SHEWS OBJECTS IN THEIR NATURAL POSITION HE MAY USE ONE CONSISTING OF A CONVEX OBJECTGLASS AND A CONCAVE EYEGLASS WHICH KIND OF TELESCOPE ANSWERS BETTER IN SHORT LENGTHS THAN THE OTHER BEFORE I DELIVER THE PROCESS OF THE COMPUTATION OF THE LONGITUDE I SHALL FIRST SAY SOMETHING WITH RESPECT TO THE OBSERVATIONS THEMSELVES AND MENTION SOME CAUTIONS CONCERNING THEM A MOST PARTICULAR ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO THE EXACT ADJUSTMENT OF THE QUADRANT AS A THING OF EQUAL CONSEQUENCE WITH THE OBSERVATION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON THIS IS SO MUCH THE MORE NECESSARY AS THE ADJUSTMENT IS SUBJECT TO ALTER SEN SIBLY EVEN FROM ONE DAY TO ANOTHER THE BEST OBJECT OF ALL FOR THIS PURPOSE IS THE HORIZON OF THE SEA WHEN CLEAR AND I FOUND IT MOST CONVENIENT IN THIS CASE NOT TO USE THE TELESCOPE BUT APPLIED A CON CAVE GLASS TO MY EYE WHICH WAS FITTED FOR GIVING 4 C 2 ME562 ME THE MOST DISTINCT VIEW OF DISTANT OBJECTS WHICH ALSO I ALWAYS USED IN ALL OBSERVATIONS WHERE THE TELE SCOPE WAS NOT APPLIED THE OBSERVER SHOULD ALWAYS BE CAREFUL TO EXAMINE THE ADJUSTMENT OF HIS QUADRANT IN THE DAYTIME WHEN THE HORIZON IS TO BE SEEN CLEARLY AND PARTICULARLY IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN HE EXPECTS TO MAKE AN OBSERVATION THE ENSUING NIGHT SHOULD HE HAVE FAILED OF MAKING THIS EXAMINATION THE AFTERNOON BEFORE AN OBSERVATION HE MAY EXAMINE WHAT THE ERROR WAS IF ANY THE NEXT MORNING OR HE MAY MAKE THIS EXAMINATION BY MEANS OF THE MOON ITSELF IN WHICH CASE IT WILL BE BEST TO USE THE TELESCOPE THOUGH THE HORIZON OF THE SEA IS IN GENERAL BY FAR THE BEST OBJECT FOR THIS PURPOSE AS I FOUND MY QUADRANT WOULD SELDOM CONTINUE EXACTLY ADJUSTED FOR TWENTYFOUR HOURS TOGETHER INSTEAD OF FRESH AD JUSTING IT EVERY DAY I CHOSE RATHER TO EXAMINE WHAT THE ERROR OF THE ADJUSTMENT ITSELF WAS THIS IS DONE BY TURNING THE INDEX OF THE QUADRANT TILL THE HORIZON OF THE SEA OR THE MOON OR ANY OTHER PROPER OBJECT APPEARS AS ONE AND THEN THE NUMBER OF MINUTES BY WHICH O ON THE INDEX DIFFERS FROM O ON THE ARCH IS THE ERROR OF THE ADJUSTMENT IF O ON THE INDEX STANDS ADVANCED UPON THE QUADRANT BEFORE OR TO THE LEFT HAND OF O ON THE ARCH THAT NUMBER OF MINUTES IS TO BE SUBTRACTED FROM ALL OBSERVATIONS BUT IF IT STANDS OFF THE ARCH BEHIND OR TO THE RIGHT HAND OF O ON THE ARCH IT MUST BE ADDED TO THE OBSERVATIONS BY EXA MINING THE ERROR OF THE ADJUSTMENT IN THIS MANNER BY AT LEAST THREE TRIALS AND TAKING A MEDIUM OF THE RE SULTS ONE CAN SCARCE ERR ABOVE HALF A MINUTE IN DETER MINING THE EXACT ERROR OF THE QUADRANT WHEREAS ONE MAY BE MISTAKEN A MINUTE OR MORE BY A SINGLE TRIAL THE563 THE OBSERVER WOULD DO WELL TO WRITE DOWN IN A BOOK THE ERROR OF ADJUSTMENT THUS FOUND AND WHICH WAY IT IS TO BE APPLIED WHETHER IT IS ADDITIVE OR SUBTRAC TIVE AS IT IS NECESSARY TO KNOW THE EXACT TIME OF THE DAY WHEN THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON IS TAKEN WHICH CAN ONLY BE FOUND AT SEA BY AN AL TITUDE OF THE SUN OR A STAR AND AS THE ALTITUDE OF A PROPER STAR CANNOT ALWAYS BE TAKEN WITH SUFFICIENT EXACTNESS IN THE NIGHT FOR THIS PURPOSE I WOULD RE COMMEND IT TO THE OBSERVER WHEN HE EXPECTS TO OB SERVE THE MOON AT NIGHT TO TAKE AN ALTITUDE OF THE SUN IN THE AFTERNOON TWO OR THREE HOURS FROM NOON THE MORE THE BETTER PROVIDED THE SUN BE NOT TOO NEAR THE HORIZON NOTING THE EXACT TIME SHEWN BY HIS WATCH AT THE INSTANT OF OBSERVATION WHICH WILL SHEW HIM BY COMPUTATION HOW MUCH HIS WATCH IS TOO FAST OR SLOW FOR THE MERIDIAN OF THE PLACE WHENCE THE TIME SHEWN BY THE WATCH BEING ALSO NOTED WHEN THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON WAS TAKEN HE WILL KNOW WHAT THE EXACT TIME OF THE DAY THEN WAS OR IF AN ALTITUDE OF THE SUN WAS NOT TAKEN THE EVENING BEFORE AN ALTITUDE MIGHT BE TAKEN THE NEXT MORNING AFTER THE OBSERVATION OF THE MOON PROVIDED THE INTER VAL OF TIME BETWEEN THE OBSERVATION OF THE MOON AND THE SUNS ALTITUDE DID NOT EXCEED TWELVE HOURS FOR A GOOD COMMON WATCH WOULD HARDLY VARY ABOVE A MI NUTE DURING THAT SPACE OF TIME WHICH ONLY MAKES AN ERROR OF A QUARTER OF A DEGREE OF LONGITUDE THE TIME BEING DETERMINED BY AN ALTITUDE OF THE SUN OR A STAR AND THE DISTANCE OF A PROPER STAR FROM THE MOONS LIMB OR THE DISTANCE OF THE SUN AND MOONS NEAREST LIMBS IN THE FIRST AND LAST QUARTER BEING CAREFULLY564 CAREFULLY OBSERVED THE LONGITUDE MAY BE FOUND FROM THENCE WITHOUT ANY OTHER OBSERVATIONS AND THIS IS THE METHOD PROPOSED BY THE LATE DR HALLEY WHICH CERTAINLY DESERVES TO BE HIGHLY ESTEEMED FOR ITS GREAT SIMPLICITY AND THE SMALL NUMBER OF OBSERVATIONS WHICH IT REQUIRES NEVERTHELESS I MUST OWN MYSELF OF OPINION WITH THE LEARNED ABBE DE LA CAILLE THAT IT WILL BE MORE CONVENIENT AT SEA TO REQUIRE THE AID OF MORE OBSERVATIONS WHICH IS THE METHOD I CONSTANTLY PRACTISED MYSELF DURING MY VOYAGE HAVING ALWAYS TWO OBSERVERS WHO WERE READY ONE TO TAKE THE ALTI TUDE OF THE STAR AND THE OTHER OF THE MOONS UPPER OR LOWER LIMB AT THE INSTANT I SPOKE WHEN I HAD MADE THE OBSERVATON OF THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON I CAN THEREFORE ANSWER FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE BOTH THAT THE METHOD IS PRACTICABLE AT SEA AND ALSO THAT SO FAR FROM BEING LESS SIMPLE IT IS MORE SO THAN THE OTHER METHOD FOR THE ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS THAT IT REQUIRES ARE VERY EASILY MADE AND EVEN THE ERROR OF A DEGREE IN THE ALTITUDES WOULD SELDOM BE OF MORE CONSEQUENCE THAN AN ERROR OF A MINUTE IN TAKING THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON SO THAT AN ERROR OF 10 OR 15 IN THE ALTITUDES WOULD BE OF NO GREAT PREJUDICE BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE FACILITY OF THE CAL CULATIONS THERE IS NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ME THODS THE LATTER BEING MUCH LESS INTRICATE AND MUCH MORE CONCISE THE ABBE DE LA CAILLE REQUIRES THE ALTITUDE OF THAT PART OF THE MOONS LIMB FROM WHICH THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR IS TAKEN BUT AS AT SEA WE CAN ONLY TAKE THE ALTITUDE OF THE MOONS UPPER OR LOWER LIMB AN ALLOWANCE MIGHT BE MADE NEAR ENOUGH BY ESTIMATION OF THE EYE FOR THE DIFFERENCE OF ALTITUDE BETWEEN565 BETWEEN THE MOONS UPPER OR LOWER LIMB AND THAT PART OF THE LIMB FROM WHICH THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR IS TAKEN I GENERALLY ADDED THE SEMIDIAMETER OF THE MOON TO OR SUBTRACTED IT FROM THE OBSERVED ALTITUDE OF THE LOWER OR UPPER LIMB IN ORDER TO HAVE THE AP PARENT ALTITUDE OF THE CENTER AND I FOUND THE APPARENT DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOONS CENTER BY ADDING OR SUBTRACTING THE MOONS HORIZONTAL SEMIDIAMETER AUGMENTED ACCORDING TO HER HEIGHT TO OR FROM THE OBSERVED DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOONS NEAREST OR REMOTEST LIMB THIS METHOD WILL BE EXACT ENOUGH IF THE ALTITUDE OF THE MOON OR STAR BE NOT LESS THAN 5 HAVING THUS GOT THREE SIDES OF THE SPHERICAL TRIANGLE FORMED BY THE MOON THE STAR AND THE ZENITH NAMELY THE APPARENT ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE MOON THE APPARENT ZENITH DI STANCE OF THE STAR AND THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON I FIND THE EFFECT OF REFRACTION AND PARALLAX IN ALTERING THE APPARENT DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON BY THE TWO FOLLOWING RULES R U L E I TO FIND THE EFFECT OF REFRACTION IN CONTRACTING THE APPARENT DISTANCE OF TWO STARS OR OF THE MOON AND A STAR ADD TOGETHER THE LOGARITHMTANGENTS OF HALF THE SUM AND HALF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO ZENITH DI STANCES THE SUM ABATING 10 FROM THE INDEX IS THE TANGENT OF ARC THE FIRST TO THE LOGARITHMTANGENT JUST FOUND ADD THE LOGARITHMCOTANGENT OF HALF THE DISTANCE OF THE TWO STARS THE SUM ABATING 10 FROM THE INDEX IS THE TANGENT OF ARC THE SECOND THEN ADD566 ADD TOGETHER INTO ONE SUM THE LOGARITHMTANGENT OF DOUBLE THE FIRST ARC THE COSECANT OF DOUBLE THE SE COND ARC AND THE CONSTANT LOGARITHM 20569 THE SUM ABATING 20 FROM THE INDEX IS THE LOGARITHM OF THE NUMBER OF SECONDS REQUIRED BY WHICH THE DIST ANCE OF THE STARS OR OF THE MOON AND STARS IS CON TRACTED BY REFRACTION WHICH THEREFORE ADDED TO THE OBSERVED DISTANCE GIVES THE TRUE DISTANCE CLEARED FROM REFRACTION N B THIS RULE MAY BE MADE UNIVERSAL SO AS TO SERVE WITH EQUAL EXACTNESS ALMOST DOWN TO THE HORIZON IF THE APPARENT ZENITH DISTANCES BE DI MINISHED BY THREE TIMES THE REFRACTION BELONG ING TO THEM FOUND FROM ANY COMMON TABLE OF REFRACTION AND THE COMPUTATION BE MADE WITH THE ZENITH DISTANCES THUS CORRECTED BUT IF THE ALTITUDES OF THE MOON AND STAR BE NOT LESS THAN 10 THIS CORRECTION WILL NOT BE NECESSARY IT WILL NOT BE PROPER TO MAKE THE OBSERVATIONS IF THE ALTITUDES OF THE STAR AND MOON ARE EITHER OF OF THEM LESS THAN 4 OR 5 ON ACCOUNT OF THE VARIABLENESS OF REFRACTION NEAR THE HORIZON R U L E II TO FIND HOW MUCH THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON AND A STAR IS INCREASED OR DIMINISHED ON ACCOUNT OF THE MOONS PARALLAX ADD TOGETHER INTO ONE SUM THE LOGARITHMTANGENTS OF HALF THE SUM AND HALF THE DIFFERENCE OF THE ZENITH DISTANCES AND THE COTANGENT OF HALF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR ALL CORRECTED FOR REFRACTION THE SUM ABATING 20 FROM THE INDEX IS THE TANGENT OF ARC THE567 THE THIRD FOR WHICH ARC THE SECOND FOUND BY THE FIRST RULE MAY BE TAKEN WITHOUT ANY SENSIBLE ERROR THEN IF THE ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE MOON IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE STAR TAKE THE SUM OF THIS ARC AND HALF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR BUT IF THE ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE MOON IS LESS THAN THAT OF THE STAR TAKE THE DIFFERENCE OF THE SAID ARCS THE TANGENT OF THE SUM OR DIFFERENCE WHICH MAY BE CALLED THE PARALLACTIC ARCH ADDED TO THE COSINE OF THE MOONS ZENITH DISTANCE AND THE LOGARITHM OF THE MOONS HORIZONTAL PARALLAX IN MINUTES ABATING 20 FROM THE INDEX IS THE LOGARITHM OF THE NUMBER OF MINUTES REQUIRED BY WHICH THE APPARENT DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR IS ALWAYS AUGMENTED BY PARALLAX UNLESS THE ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE STAR BE GREATER THAN THAT OF THE MOON AND AT THE SAME TIME ARC THE THIRD BE GREATER THAN HALF THE DI STANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR IN WHICH CASE THE AP PARENT DISTANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR IS DIMINISHED BY THE PARALLAX THEREFORE THE NUMBER OF MINUTES FOUND BY THIS RULE IS ALWAYS TO BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE OBSERVED DI STANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR FIRST CORRECTED FOR RE FRACTION IN ORDER TO FIND THE TRUE DISTANCE CLEARED FROM THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX LIKEWISE EXCEPT IN THE CASE SPECIFIED WHEN THE ZENITH DISTANCE OF THE STAR IS GREATER THAN THAT OF THE MOON AND ARC THE THIRD IS AT THE SAME TIME GREATER THAN HALF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON AND STAR WHEN THE CORRECTION IS TO BE ADDED IN COMPUTING THESE CORRECTIONS FOUR PLACES OF FIGURES BESIDES THE INDEX WILL BE SUFFICIENT IT REMAINS TO BE FOUND BY CALCULATION AT WHAT HOUR UNDER A KNOWN MERIDIAN THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR WILL BE THE SAME AS RESULTS FROM VOL LII 4 D THE568 THE OBSERVATION CLEARED OF REFRACTION AND PARALLAX FOR THIS PURPOSE IT IS NECESSARY TO COMPUTE THE MOONS LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE AND HORARY MOTION BOTH IN LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE FROM THE MOST EXACT TABLES FOR THE TIME UNDER THE KNOWN MERIDIAN WHICH IS JUDGED TO CORRESPOND NEARLY TO THE GIVEN TIME OF OBSERVATION UNDER THE UNKNOWN MERIDIAN THE MEAN MOTIONS OF THE SUN AND MOON I TOOK FROM VERY EXACT TABLES WHICH I RECEIVED AS A PRESENT FROM THE INGENIOUS MR GAEL MORRIS COMPOSED BY HIMSELF FROM THE COMPARISON OF A GREAT NUMBER OF DR BRADLEYS OBSERVATIONS TO WHICH I APPLIED THE LUNAR EQUATIONS AS THEY STAND IN THE LEARNED MR MAYERS PRINTED TABLES AFTER FINDING THE MEAN LON GITUDE OF THE STAR AT THE PRESENT TIME I ALWAYS ALLOWED FOR ITS ABERRATION IN LONGITUDE WHICH WILL SOMETIMES AMOUNT TO 20 WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE ABERRATION IN LATITUDE WHICH CAN BE OF NO CONSEQUENCE IN A ZO DIACAL STAR SUCH AS THOSE ARE WHICH ARE ALWAYS TO BE USED IN THESE OBSERVATIONS THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON I COMPUTED FROM THEIR LONGITUDES AND LATITUDE BY THE TWO FOLLOWING RULES R U L E I ADD TOGETHER THE LOGARITHMIC COSINE OF THE DIF FERENCE OF THE COMPUTED LONGITUDES OF THE MOON AND STAR AND LOGARITHMIC COSINE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF THEIR LATITUDES IF THEY ARE OF THE SAME DENOMINATION OR SUM IF THEY ARE OF DIFFERENT DENOMINATIONS THE SUM ABATING 10 FROM THE INDEX IS THE COSINE OF THE APPRO XIMATE DISTANCE N B THIS GIVES THE ABSOLUTE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE SUN WITHOUT ANY FURTHER CALCULATION 1 BUT569 BUT IN CASE OF A STAR IT IS NECESSARY TO APPLY AN OTHER RULE ALSO SEVEN PLACES OF LOGARITHMS BE SIDES THE INDEX MUST BE USED IN COMPUTING FROM THIS RULE AND THE CALCULATION MUST BE CARRIED TO SECONDS R U L E II TO THE CONSTANT LOGARITHM 35363 ADD THE SINES OF THE MOONS AND STARS LATITUDES THE VERSEDSINE OF THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE AND THE COSECANT OF THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE JUST FOUND THE SUM ABATING 40 FROM THE INDEX IS THE LOGARITHM OF A NUMBER OF MI NUTES TO BE SUBTRACTED FROM THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE TO FIND THE TRUE DISTANCE IF THE LATITUDES OF THE MOON AND STAR ARE OF THE SAME DENOMINATION BUT TO BE ADDED IF THEY ARE OF CONTRARY DENOMINATIONS THE SECOND OF THESE TWO RULES THOUGH ONLY AN APPROXIMA TION IS SO EXACT THAT IF THE LATITUDE OF THE MOON WAS 5 AND THAT OF THE STAR 15 THE ERROR RESULTING WOULD BE ONLY 10 IN THE DISTANCE FOUR PLACES OF FIGURES WILL BE SUFFICIENT IN COMPUTING FROM THIS RULE IF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR THUS COMPUTED AT THE ASSUMED TIME UNDER A KNOWN ME RIDIAN SUPPOSE GREENWICH AGREES WITH THE DISTANCE OBSERVED CORRECTED FOR REFRACTION AND PARALLAX THE TIME AT GREENWICH WAS ASSUMED RIGHT AND THE DIF FERENCE BETWEEN THIS TIME AND THE TIME OF THE OBSER VATION UNDER THE UNKNOWN MERIDIAN IS THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE IN TIME BETWEEN THE SAID MERIDIAN AND GREENWICH WHICH IS TURNED INTO DEGREES AND MI NUTES OF THE EQUATOR BY ALLOWING 15 FOR EVERY HOUR AND 1 FOR EVERY FOUR MINUTES OF TIME 4 D 2 BUT570 BUT IF THE DISTANCE COMPUTED DIFFERS FROM THE DI STANCE INFERRED FROM THE OBSERVATION IT MUST BE FOUND BY PROPORTION FROM THE MOONS HORARY MOTION TO OR FROM THE STAR HOW LONG TIME SHE WILL TAKE TO RUN OVER THAT DIFFERENCE WHENCE THE TIME WILL BE FOUND AT GREENWICH WHEN THE TRUE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR WAS THE SAME WITH THAT RESULTING FROM THE OBSERVATION WHICH COMPARED WITH THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION BY THE MERIDIAN OF THE SHIP GIVES THE DIF FERENCE OF LONGITUDE FROM GREENWICH AS BEFORE IF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR COMPUTED AGREES WITH THAT RESULTING FROM OBSERVATION WITHIN 10 OR 12 AND THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR BE NOT LESS THAN 20 OR 30 THE HORARY MOTION OF THE MOON IN THE ECLIPTIC MAY BE TAKEN FOR THE HORARY MOTION OF THE MOON TO OR FROM THE STAR BUT OTHER WISE THE MOONS LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE MUST BE FOUND AT AN HOURS INTERVAL AFTER THE TIME ASSUMED AT GREEN WICH BY ADDING THE HORARY MOTIONS TO THE LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE COMPUTED AND BY THE APPLICATION OF THE RULES THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON MUST BE FOUND AGAIN AT THE END OF THAT HOUR WHICH GIVES THE HORARY MOTION TO OR FROM THE STAR AS REQUIRED IT IS TO BE OBSERVED THAT THE LONGITUDE THUS FOUND IS THAT OF THE SHIP AT THE INSTANT WHEN THE ALTITUDE OF THE SUN OR STAR WAS TAKEN BY WHICH THE WATCH WAS REGULATED AND NOT AT THE TIME OF THE OBSERVATION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON FOR THE WATCH BEING SUPPOSED NOT TO VARY CONSIDERABLY DURING THAT INTERVAL OF TIME MUST CONTINUE TO INDICATE THE TIME ACCORDING TO THE MERIDIAN BY WHICH IT WAS CORRECTED AND THE OBSERVATION OF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE STAR SHEWING THE TIME AT GREENWICH THE DIFFERENCE MUST571 MUST SHEW THE DIFFERENCE OF LONGITUDE BETWEEN THAT MERIDIAN AND GREENWICH PERHAPS THE FOLLOWING METHOD OF DEDUCING THE LONGITUDE FROM THE OBSERVATIONS MAY BE LEAST LIABLE TO MISTAKE FIND WHAT THE LONGITUDE BY ACCOUNT WAS AT THE INSTANT OF TAKING THE SUNS OR STARS ALTITUDE FOR THE REGULATION OF THE WATCH WHICH BEING TURNED INTO TIME AT THE RATE OF ONE HOUR FOR EVERY 15 AND FOUR MINUTES FOR EVERY DEGREE ADD TO THE CORRECT TIME FROM NOON WHEN THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON WAS TAKEN IF THE SHIP IS TO THE WEST OF GREEN WICH OR SUBTRACT FROM IT IF IT BE TO THE EAST THIS GIVES THE APPARENT TIME AT GREENWICH BY ACCOUNT AND THE MEAN TIME IS FOUND BY APPLYING THE EQUATION OF TIME TO WHICH TIME COMPUTE THE MOONS LONGITUDE AND LATITUDE FROM THE TABLES AND THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE MOON BY THE RULES AND FIND BY PROPOR TION AS BEFORE WHAT TIME THE MOON WILL TAKE TO RUN OVER THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE DISTANCE COMPUTED AND THAT RESULTING FROM THE OBSERVATION THIS TURNED INTO DEGREES AND MINUTES OF THE EQUATOR WILL SHEW THE ERROR OF THE SHIPS ACCOUNT AND THE FOLLOWING RULES WILL SHOW WHETHER THE SHIP IS TO THE EAST OR WEST OF ITS ACCOUNT IF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON OBSERVED EAST OF A STAR OR THE SUN IN THE FIRST QUARTER IS GREATER THAN THAT COMPUTED THE SHIP IS WEST OF THE LONGITUDE BY AC COUNT BUT IF THE DISTANCE OBSERVED IS LESS THAN THAT COMPUTED IT IS EAST OF ACCOUNT IF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON OBSERVED WEST OF A STAR OR THE SUN IN THE LAST QUARTER IS GREATER THAN COM PUTED THE SHIP IS EAST OF ACCOUNT BUT IF THE DISTANCE OBSERVED572 OBSERVED IS LESS THAN COMPUTED IT IS WEST OF AC COUNT THE HORARY MOTION OF THE MOON IN THE

WESTERN COAST OF AFRICA THOUGH I HAD NO OBSERVATION OF THE MOON WITHIN LESS THAN EIGHT DAYS OF MY ARRIVAL AT ST HELENA I MAKE THE LONGITUDE OF THE ISLAND BY MY ACCOUNT TO BE ONLY 1 12 EAST OF ITS TRUE SITUATION WHICH IS 534 WEST OF LONDON WHEREAS THE ACCOUNT KEPT IN THE COMMON MANNER MADE THE ISLAND 112 EAST OF LONDON OR 7 14 EAST OF ITS TRUE SITUATION AND MOST OF THE AC COUNTS ON BOARD THE SHIP MADE IT 10 EAST OF THE TRUE LONGITUDE HAVING GOT TWELVE OBSERVATIONS IN THE COMPASS575 COMPASS OF ELEVEN DAYS BETWEEN MARCH 9TH AND 20TH I HAD THE CURIOSITY TO COMPARE THEM TOGETHER SETTING ASIDE ANY ERRORS IN THE COMMON METHOD OF KEEPING A SHIPS RECKONING AND SUPPOSING US NOT TO BE AFFECTED BY CURRENTS DURING THIS TIME THE SAME DIFFERENCE OUGHT TO HAVE BEEN FOUND BETWEEN ALL THE LONGITUDES BY

PARALLEL WHICH I AM AFRAID THEY VERY OFTEN ARE NOT BY THE COMMON METHODS THEY MAY EASILY PRODUCE A REFRAC TION OF SOME MINUTES AS A PROOF HOW NEAR DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS MADE IN COMPASS OF AN HOUR OR TWO WILL AGREE IN GIVING THE SAME LONGITUDE FEBRUARY 11TH BY TEN DIFFERENT OB SERVATIONS OF THE DISTANCE OF THE MOON FROM THE SUN I MADE THE LONGITUDE REDUCED TO NOON AS USUAL 28 57 29 50 29 16 29 22 29 53 28 59 29 30 29 48 29 30 29 30 NONE OF WHICH DIFFER ABOVE HALF A DEGREE FROM 29 22 WHICH IS THE MEDIUM OF THEM ALL MARCH 18TH BY FOUR DIFFERENT OBSERVATIONS OF THE DISTANCE OF POLLUX FROM THE MOON I FOUND THE LONGITUDE 23 52 TWICE AND 24 8 TWICE I NEVER FOUND THAT A SINGLE OBSERVATION WOULD GIVE THE LONGITUDE ABOVE A DEGREE DIFFERENT FROM THE MEDIUM RESULTING FROM THREE OR FOUR OBSERVATIONS AND SELDOM ABOVE HALF A DEGREE WHICH ARGUES THAT THE ERROR OF ANY SINGLE OBSERVATION NEVER EXCEEDED TWO MINUTES AND SELDOM ONE MINUTE FROM THE WHOLE I CONGRATULATE THE CURIOUS ASTRO NOMER AND INGENIOUS MARINER THAT THE METHOD OF FINDING THE LONGITUDE PROPOSED BY SIR ISAAC NEWTON IS BY THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE THEORY OF WHICH HE LAID THE FOUNDATION AND BY THE GREAT PERFECTION TO WHICH OUR ARTISTS HAVE CARRIED THE CONSTRUCTION OF INSTRUMENTS RENDERED PRACTICABLE IN OUR TIMES AT SEA AS WELL AS AT LAND TO A DEGREE OF EXACTNESS SUFFICIENT TO MAKE IT OF GREAT AND VALUABLE UTILITY TO THE EXTENSIVE NAVIGA TION AND COMMERCE OF OUR NATIVE COUNTRY 4 E 2 XCIV CER

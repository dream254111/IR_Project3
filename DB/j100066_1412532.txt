set up by simple visual forms shown to the observer upon a background subliminally or liminally different from themselves We wished to ascertain whether the illusory perception and associative completion of figures exhibited under these conditions obeyed any general law whether constant individual differences could be made out as between observer and observer and whether the development of typical figures as they passed through the stage of subliminal to that of liminal and thence to that of supra liminal difference from their background followed any constant course The problem proved to be more complex than we had supposed and the results here published are only preliminary  i METHOD AND APPARATUS The experiments were performed during the academic year I899I900 The apparatus used was that devised for another purpose by Leuba2 and modified by Whipple8 The apparatus consisted a of a blackened tube 50 cm in length and 4 cm in diameter At a distance of 8 cm before this stood b a rotating disc 49 cm in diameter in which were cut 12 radial slits 20 cm long io mm wide towards the periphery and 15 mm wide towards the center of the disc extending to a distance of 2 cm from the outer edge of the disc The disc was made of middleweight junkboard faced with gray paper The electric motor which carried the disc was slung between upright wooden guides in which it had a vertical move ment of some I5 cm The tube pointed through the upper portion above the axis of the disc so that the lower the disc the greater was the amount of gray interposed between tube and object At a distance of 150 cm from the disc was placed c a standard carrying a gray card I55 cm square upon which was pasted an outline figure of gray about 7 cm square and 8 mm in width of line Only out line figures were used as the limen for solid figures proved to be a good deal higher than that for outlines4 The gray of the background was the MiltonBradley Cos neutral gray no I that of disc and figure

in the experiments cited belowTHE PERCEPTION OF VISUAL FORM incandescent lamps in the regular IIo v alternating current circuit The first lamp I6 c p hung 20 cm in front of the disc the second 32 c p ground glass hung 35 cm in front of the objectcard Both were shaded on the side towards the observer The illumination was not absolutely constant from day to day though it was sensibly con stant during an experimental sitting A large sheet of black card board fitted to the observing tube cut off the diffused light of the lamps and screened the whole apparatus from the observer The method of work was as follows The disc was placed at its lowest point so that the difference between figure and background was subliminal At a  Now following a warn ing Ready the observer looked through tube and disc fixating the gray card Five sec were allowed for observation the introspective record was then written down After the disc had been raised 5 mm the experiment was repeated and so on The time required for a single experiment inclusive of that taken by the observer to draw and describe what he had seen was 5 to io minutes We had anticipated that there would be a considerable error of expectation but the anticipation was not borne out either by the objective results or by the introspective records It was so difficult to make out the figure at all that the observer seemed to surrender himself wholly to the present impression rather than to look for a modified form of the preceding im pression It need hardly be said that the observers never saw the figures save under the conditions of the experiment and that nothing was said to them as to the rightness or wrongness of their interpretations The figures employed numbered 7I and these were turned some through 9go and some through I8G so that the total number of stimuli was 142 A few were employed but once the more suggestive were used much oftener though not so often as to be recognized by the observer After a long period of practice 300 experiments were taken In each of these the disc was raised 8 to 30 times and each of them gave from 5 to 30 different form perceptions The observers were seven in number The observers were as follows i Miss L Aldrich A a psycho logically trained observer alert and objective in type 2 Miss J Cochran C a trained observer of the subjective type 3 Miss L Hempstead H a partially trained observer of the objective type working with full knowledge of the experiment and its aim 4 Dr W B Lane L a trained psychologist of an extremely subjective type possessed of some general knowledge of the nature of the experiment 5 Miss M F McClure M a trained observervery alert and imagi native but still of the receptive or objective type 6 Miss I G Rob ertson R an untrained observer objective and 7 Miss F M Win ger W a trained psychologistwith some knowledge of the experiment not so easily classed as the preceding observers but perhaps rather subjective than objective in her attitude towards the experiment In I86order of exactness of perception the observers fall into 5 groups A RH M W LC It does not appear that the type of the observer or his gen eral attitude towards the experiment exerted any marked influ ence upon the experimental results All that can be said is that the observers who knew nothing of the experiment and were alert and objective in temperament showed a somewhat slighter tendency to get a regular progressive series of illusory percep tions and a much slighter tendency to see figures that bore no resemblance to the stimuli than did the observers who were more suspicious and subjectively minded and who knew or guessed something of the character of the experiment Certain well defined tendencies of interpretation may be traced through all the records  2 THR VARIOUS FORMS OF ILLUSORY PERCEPTION The results of the experiment under this heading may be classified as follows A Perceptions which Bear a Definite Resemblance to the Stimulus Through all the hundreds of examples of these per ceptions certain general and unifying principles may be clearly traced They are I For the more objectively grounded perceptions i The joining of different parts of a figure i e the for mation of a continuous from a discontinuous figure This join ing may be a Of several isolated portions of a figure This is irregular and rare occurring most often where the figure is but feebly sensed It may be the condition of several of the illusions given under B below See Plate I Fig 1 a a1 b Of opposite endpoints of a given line or of a terminal point and a straight line This joining occurs very frequently when the added line runs in a direction similar to that of lines of the figure otherwise it is rare P1 I Figs 2 a a 3 a a c Occasionally of two lines whose junction can be effected by the continuation of a line in a direction parallel to itself P1 I 4 a a d See 2 b below The joining lines themselves may be i straight so that the connection will be accomplished in the shortest possible way P1 I 5 a a ii a continuation of a given linehence taking its direction PI I 6 a a iii curved as if from mere indefiniteness of direction P1 I 1 b b 1The figures in the columns under the simple letters are the figures used as stimuli those under the same letters accented show the inter pretation put upon these figures by the observer I87 HEMPSTEADTHE PERCEPTION OF VISUAL FORM iv of a form the cue to which is taken from the lines of the figure P1 I 2 b b 2 The continuation of lines The lines of the given figure may be continued a Indefinitely and irregularly when parts of the figure first begin to be sensed P1 I 3 b b b When by so doing two portions of the figure will be joined to form a more unitary whole P1 I 4 b b c When by the continuation a symmetrical figure will be produced P1 I 5 b b d When the continuation is in a direction similar to that of other lines of the figure P1 I 6 b b 3 The rounding of angles When the angles of a figure first begin to be perceived they appear round This may pos sibly be an example of the joining of two portions of a figure made possible by the higher liminal value of solid figures the angles being rather solid than open forms Very often the im pression of roundness persists even after the angularity has been perceived P1 I i cc 4 The failure to perceive lines It often happens that complete lines of a figure are not sensed although the observer is confident that he has seen the whole form and is ready to conclude the experiment This tendency is especially marked when the lines are a Short and disconnected P1 I 2 CC b Included lines P1 I 3 cc II For the more subjectively grounded perceptions i Tendencies affecting the number of lines a The addition of lines i What seem to be purely subjective lines appear to a greater or less degree with all observers and are included in nearly all outline figures They occur throughout the whole experiment though seldom towards the end They are very fleeting and uncertain It is unusual for them to persist for more than two observations or to be at all constant whether for different observers with the same figure or for the same observer and the same figure at different times The only and that a dimly definedunderlying principle is that of sym metry P1 I 4 cc ii Lines which more definitely conform to rule are added when they can be joined to the ends of given lines and run parallel to other lines P1 I 5 cc b Uncertainty in regard to number of lines Great un certainty is shown as to the number of lines especially in those figures in which a definite form or direction of line is repeated P1 I 6cc I dd I88HEMPSTEAD a a b b c c d d X  EZ5l m  9 H 2d   3 FPIA IEO 6 COOO C O U r L Ji 2 1   PLAT I  189THE PERCEPTION OF VISUAL FORM 2 Those relating to the position of lines When the figure is as yet very faint great indefiniteness in respect to position is shown P1 I 2 dd 3 Those relating to the form of lines a Lines which are nearly straight are apt to seem straight Even curved lines when short or but slightly curved occasion ally appear straight at the beginning of an experiment P1 I 3 dd b Very occasionally feebly sensed straight lines appear curved P1 I 4 dd c Very often the cue to form is taken from a part of the figure and applied from this to the whole P1 I 5 dd III Individual Illusions But one example of an illusion characteristic of only one observer was found In figures which had a broken outline R saw dark lines crossing the background and cutting the outline where incomplete P1 I 6 d d These illusions do not occur singly but in all manner of com binations the illusory lines themselves sometimes furnishing a basis for further illusions B Perceptions which Bear no Traceable Resemblance to the Given Figure Toward the beginning of the experiments and often for some time during their progress all sorts of figures were seen which bore no apparent resemblance to the given figure P1 I M W 2 C1 For some observersfor C in particularthese figures formed a continuous everchanging series lasting until the real form definitely appeared For others they came only occasionally and often in isolated ex amples Not only are the manner in which they appear and the number of observations during which they remain un changed matters of great individual difference but their num ber form and variety are also most characteristic Some 6 or 7 types of figures can be chosen for each observer of which all the other forms seen are but modifications The types are quite different for the different observers A distinction was made by the observers between these forms and those which were undoubted modifications of the real The lower part of Plate I shows the series of forms seen with a given figure The letters indicate the observers the numbers below them are inserted simply for convenience of reference The figures to the right represent the form given and those still further to the right extending across the page are the corresponding series of figures seen The small t indicates that first the one and then the other of the figures on either side was seen during a single observa tion The small numbers give the number of times that nothing was seen the small numbers placed above the figures give the number of times that these were successively seen WI and Care fragments the number of figures in the other series has been slightly changed but the series are none the less typical I90HEMPSTEAD figure They were spoken of as mere impressions The line of difference was however not sharply drawn and its drawing did not seem to be conditioned upon any necessary or intrinsic difference of perception i At times the impres sion shows decided marks of being influenced by the real figure while bearing no determinate resemblance to it It often happened e g in the cases of L and W P1 I W 2 3 that the impression gradually changed so as to become the real figure 2 The impression occurred less often and was less definite when a plain gray card was substituted for the stimulus card When we add to these facts 3 the extreme likelihood rooted in the nature of the method that the observer should utilize slight retinal stimulations for the building up of the final geometrical forms we seem to be forced to the conclusion that the  impression and the more objective  perception  are iden tical in kind The apparently contradictory fact that the im pression often changed entirely from one observation to another is still not incompatible with the theory of chance local excita bility of the retina Experiments are now in progress whose object is by variation of method to test this hypothesis and to account if possible for the form preferences of the individual observers  3 THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE FORM The apparatus was so disposed that for the first few trials the observer saw no form or at least had no more than an impression Presently portions of the figure began to appear The form might begin as a mere suggession of something and then flash suddenly out or it might develop regularly and gradually What portion was seen first seems to have been a matter of accident except that a long line was apt to be perceived earlier than a shorter one The figure was at first extremely faint in some cases coming and going so often that 4 or 5 partially different figures were seen during a single ob servation P1 I M M I W 3 4 Occasionally the whole figure would seem to move or the lines to dance and flicker as their brightness fluctuated1 Gradually in such cases the figure would become clearer a definitely marked outline re placed the narrow streaks of light shading off into the back ground which had at first held the attention The illusions of  2 were to be noticed from the moment that a form appeared at all They might last to the very end of the experiment though more often they disappeared as the figure became more definite Now and again an observer reported that he felt an irregularity in the figure before he was clearly aware of the 1G M Whipple Amer tour of Psych IX 570 I9II92 THE PERCEPTION OF VISUAL FORM nature of the irregularity P1 I W i The simpler figures and the more regular of the complex figures those composed of parallel lines were the more directly and the more correctly perceived those figures produced the most illusions whose lines offered the most varied foundation for them SUMMARY I In looking at forms liminally different from their back ground we are likely to continue lines and to complete figures under the guidance of the two principles of symmetry and similarity We are also likely to round angles and to neglect certain lines altogether 2 On the more subjective side we have but an indefinite idea of the number form and position of the component lines Our perception is again guided by the principles of symmetry and similarity 3 Each observer has certain habits of illusion or certain typical modes of associative completion which persist with modification throughout his records

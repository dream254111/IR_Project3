changes in duced in soils heated to temperatures between 50 C and 500 0 with reference to the effect of such treatment upon seed germination and plant growth The results appear to have some value in explaining the striking effects in jurious and beneficial observed on sterilized or partially sterilized soils The work of Rus sell1 and his associates Pickering2 and Schreiner and Lathrop3 have led in general to quite different conclusions as regards the nature of the injurious action These and other workers have also maintained consider ably different views regarding the nature of the beneficial action of sterilized soils The difference in opinion is perhaps due in a large measure to the point of view from which the investigation has been undertaken as well as to the manner in which the sterilization of the soil has been accomplished The conclusions drawn here are considered to apply partic ularly to soils heated above 100 0 although it is believed that the same principles apply in soils heated to lower temperatures An endeavor has been made to give due considera tion to the several phases of the subject since these involve not only chemical biological and physical changes in the soil but also the physi ological and pathological conditions of the seeds and plants grown in these soils The method of investigation by which the results presented in this paper were obtained has been largely that of attempting to corre late the chemical changes produced in the heated soils with their effect upon seed germi nation and plant growth The amount of watersoluble material formed by heating has been measured by the lowering of the freezing point For this the Beckmann thermometer was used Ammonia was determined by the ordinary method of distilling in the presence of magnesium oxide The nitrate was deter Russell and Petherbridge Jour Agr Sci 5 248287 1913 2 Pickering Jour Agr Soi 3 277284 1910 Soils Bul 89 pp 737 1912 3 Schreiner and Lathrop U S Dept Agr Bur mined colorimetrically by the phenoldisul phonic acid method Seed germination tests were made on the soil in Petri dishes The seeds were placed on the surface of the soil which was almost saturated with distilled water Various kinds of seeds were employed but especial use was made of cabbage The results in general were similar for the different seeds though they varied much in their susceptibility to the injurious action Lettuce and clover seeds for instance were very susceptible to the injurious action of highly heated soils whereas rye and buckwheat were very resistant Plant growth is affected in much the same manner wheat for example recovering rapidly from the deleterious action of certain heated soils where tomatoes ap peared to be permanently injured Different soils give markedly different results upon heat ing to the same temperatures The action ap pears to be dependent particularly upon the content of organic matter in the heated soil as this influences both the amount of decom position and the absorptive power of the soil for the substances produced upon heating These results are in general confirmatory of the work of others upon this subject The temperature to which the soil is heated is seemingly the most important factor in determining the extent of the injurious or beneficial action Approximately 250 C was found to be the most critical temperature in all the soils used At this temperature seed germination was most strikingly retarded Early plant growth was usually checked for the longest period of time on soils heated to 250 C although late plant growth In the case of some crops at least was most vigorous on these soils Heating to temperatures of 300 C or above in all the soils used again reduced the injurious action to seed germina tion and early plant growth as well as the beneficial action to late plant growth Heating soils to 250 C produced greater amounts of material extractable with water than heating to higher or lower temperatures The ammonia content of the soil increased proportionally to the temperature of heating up to about 250 C after which it rapidly 434 SCIENCEMARCH 24 1916 SCIENCE fell to a minimum The increase in ammonia was accompanied by a decrease in nitrates which were practically nonexistent in the highly heated soils The ammonia produced on heating soil has been suggested by Russell as causing the in jurious action although no evidence on this point could be obtained Pickering suggested that the injurious factor was volatile in na ture on account of its gradual disappearance from the soil but Russell disagrees on this point Russell however worked with low temperatures usually not exceeding 100 0 and with volatile antiseptics Under such treatment only relatively small amounts of ammonia are produced directly and seed germination and plant growth are not so stri kingly affected as in soils heated to higher temperatures The percentage of seed germination has been found to be closely correlated with the amount of ammonia present in the heated soils studied The amount of ammonia required to injure germination however appears to vary with the type of soil when comparisons of different heated soils are made It appears that the absorptive power of the soil is a very impor tant limiting factor in determining the extent of the injurious action The presenec of dihydroxystearic acid as de scribed by Schreiner could not be demonstrated in the most toxic of the heated soils That the toxic substance is of a volatile nature is evident by the fact that it is readily removed from the soil by aeration If collected in water upon removal its toxicity can be readily demonstrated By collecting in a hydrochloric acid solution the chemical composition of the resultant salt has been shown to be ammonium chloride containing ammonia in sufficient quantity to account for the toxic action of heated soils It is improbable that all the ammonia pro duced in heated soils exists as free ammonia Large amounts of carbon dioxide are also pro duced when soils are heated which possibly accounts for the increased acidity of heated soils The evidence at hand points toward the formation and injurious action of ammonium carbonates particularly These salts being un stable in the soil except when kept in a dry and unaerated condition accounts for the gradual disappearance of the injurious action of heated soils It also appears that other com pounds of ammonia are formed which are more stable in character The beneficial action of heated soils on plant growth especially of those heated between 150 C and 250 0 is believed to be due in a large part to the direct assimilation of ammonia or ammonium compounds by the plants after the manner described by various workers The increased growth follows in practically all cases after a period of injuri ous action to plant growth and is no doubt dependent upon the reduction of the toxic substance to a point where it is stimulatory or acts as a plant food The relative impor tance of increased plant food production as a result of bacterial activity and of direct chem ical action in highly heated soils remains to be ascertained The

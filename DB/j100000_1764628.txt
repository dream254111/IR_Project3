apart and filled to their edges with sand The Indians divide into two parties and draw lots for the first move The winners of the move take a small black stone and raising a blanket between themselves and their opponents to con zzeal their operations hide the stone in one of the moccasons bury ing it in the sand so that it is entirely out of sight The others then try to find the stone by striking with a stick the moccason supposed to contain it If they find it they take the stone in turn and hide it the others guessing but if they fail their opponents hold it until it is found each time hanging up the blanket and changing or pretending to change its location The game is counted by means of a hundred and two long slender sticks on each side which change hands as the sides win or lose The system of counting is very intricate the count depending upon the location of the ball Four six or ten counters change hands at each hiding The chances are almost all in favor of the holders of athe ball and frequently one side will lose all of their counters be fore the ball is found when the game comes to an end Two of the counters on each side are notched and are called grmd mothers When there has been a long run of bad luck the 4 grandmothers  are stuck up in the ground and told to go and seek their grandchildren meaning to bring back the luck and the lost eounters It is supposed to be lucky to hold the  grandmothers  until the last so they are not laid out until the others are all gone The myth on which the kesichay is founded is based like most other Indian traditions upon the sayings and doings of animals in those ages when the world was supposed to be peopled entirely with beasts There were some animals the tradition runs that saw better hunted better and were happier in the light and Others that liked the dark As it was thought wise that the exist ing alternation of night and day should be changed so as to suit one or the other of these classes it was determined to call a coun cil of the animals to determine in whose favor the change should be made When all were together they decided to play the kesi chay to settle the controversy The council was held at night and the game progressed with varying success for many hours During the play the animals of either side began to sing songs illustrative of their luck or their feelings sometimes taunting each other with their ill success Every animal present sang of his own character istics and so the foundation of the present animal songs of the kesichay was laid When the blanket is put up the holders of the ball sing a chant to the effect that  the old screen hangs in front the old screen hangs in front repeated many times The bear the dog the owl every bird and animal known to the Navajo has some appropriate song that is sung in the game The game between the nocturnal and the diurnal animals developed into a round of taunting songs flung from one side to another un til some one called on the raven He sang a song of the morning and cried that the dawn had come when the eastern sky began to be filled with light and with a mingled cry of disappointment the nocturnal animals fled to their homes scattering the articles used n the game which was thus brought to an undecided end For this reason the alternation of night and day has never been 6hanged The moccasons used belonged to the bear who in his hurry put them on wrong thus giving his feet their peculiar shape The sun shone on him before he reached his den and turned his black coat to a reddish brown which is its color now A Navajo Indian will not kill a snake but if one is encountered will put a stick beneath it and toss it away so if a snake come into the tent where the kesichay is being played it is tossed from one side to the other by the opponents in the hope that it will lbring bad luck to those with whom it stays ELECTRICAL NEWS The Use of Condensers in distributing Electricity Two patents have been lately issued in which condensers are employed to reduce from a high to a low potential in place of transformers or storagebatteries One of these plans has been al ready described in this journal and an objection to it was pointed out Briefly it consisted in charging a condenser of comparatively small capacity to a high potential discharging it into a much larger condenser thereby decreasing the potential and finally discharging the latter through the lampcircuit This operation was continu ously and rapidly performed One objection that was pointed out lay in the great capacity that would be required for the Iarge con denser Another objection lies in the great waste of energy The energy of the smaller condenser before it is connected with the larger is 2 m c where on is the quantity of electricity on it and c is its capacity After it is discharged into the larger condenser the energy of the two is 2   CC1 where ci is the capacity of the latter If we wish to reduce our potential from 2000 volts to I00 C1 must be I9 C and the energy in the last case is only onetwentieth of that in the first the differ ence having appeared as heat in the conductor connecting the two condensers We have in fact an efficiency of only five per cent Another condenser apparatus for reducing from a high to a low potential has been patented by W J McElroy The groups of sheets of which the condenser is made are of two sizes the smaller size being connected with the main line while the larger are con nected through the lampcircuit with the earth The main line is supplied by an alternating current The inventor describes the re sult as follows  The electromotive force available for the con sumption circuit is easily regulated or set by the relative sizes of the sheets in the respective sides of the condenser the larger the difference the lower the induced electromotive force  and the nunaber of sheets will depend on the current strength needed for the particular circuit supplied    For example if it be de sired to carry on the main line a current of I000 volts and to sup ply a current on the consumption linesof I00 volts then the size of the sheets on the one side must bear the proper proportion to those at the other side If we consider for a moment what the potential of the sheets on the consumption side will be we see in the first place that if they are not connected in any way with the earth their potential will be that of the highpotential plates If they are directly connected with the earth their potential will be always zero and according as they are connected to the earth through a high or low resistance their potential will be high or low As for the increased size of the sheets connected with the lampcircuit it has nothing at all to do with the phenomenon and the effect would be approximately the same if they were reduced to the size of the small sheets It would not be difficult to calculate whether the system would regulate itself but it is hardly in place here Some of the objections to it outside of the question of regulation lie in the size of the condensers re quired and in the fact that if only a few lamps are in use it would be almost a dangerous to touch the lampcircuit as the dynamo circuit THE ACTION OF ELECTRICITY ON THE VESICLES OF CON DENSED STEAMM J L Soret describes the following interest ing experiment in the Archz7ves des Sczences In a dark room a platinum cup containing water is placed on a metal support which is connected with one pole of a Topler machine Above this cup a metal point is placed which is connected with the other pole of the machine A Bunsen burner boils the water in the cup which is powerfully illuminated by the projection of a large pencil of the electric light As long as the Topler machine is at rest the vapor vesicles ascend in the ordinary way but as soon as the machine is at work the action of electricity on the vapor is manifested in a most striking manner For a certain distance from the point to the surface of the water the clouds collect and whirl along the edge of the cup under the influence of the electric light they look to a certain extent like flames If the point is brought a little nearer the water the vapor disappears completely although the water continues to boil briskly COMMELIN DESMAZURES AND BAILHACHE STORAGEBAT TERYM Reymer in his recent work  Laccumulateur Vol270 taique describes this

author ities have perfect confidence in their ability to extend their central station work still further and a concession has been given for the establishment of two new stations Both stations must be ready within two years and each must be able to supply current for 6ooo glowlamps burning simultaneously The capacities of the two stations are to be eventually increased to 24ooo and I2000 lamps The network of cables to be laid down in connection withithese stations is very complete and practically comprises all the streets of the respective districts some small sidestreets alone excepted In view of this extension of their business the Edison Company propose to increase their share capital at present by 750ooo and later on by I500000 The supply of current within the districts to be lighted will be compulsory provided the customer is willing to take the light for at least one year THE EICKEMEYER DYNAMOThe EZectrscaS Revsew con tains a description of a dynamo which has just been built by Mr Eickemeyer to be used in  forming the plates of storagebatteries The novelty of this machine lies in the fact that both the armature and magnet coils are surrounded by a heavy casing of cast iron The advantage of the type lies in the fact that there is no chance for lines of force to take any other path than through the armature so that all magnetic leakage is avoided The dynamo is to give 40 amperes at IOOO volts Its weight is 6ooo pounds the principal part of which is in the castiron casing The armature is of the drum type I8 inches in diameter by I5 inches long There are 240 turns of No

description of a trial of an electric locomotive is given in Indwstrzes  The trial trip of an electric locomotive for drawing the tramcars of the Birmingham CentralLi Tramways Company took place in the presence of a large number of representatives of the press the corporation and of the various tramway companies The engine itself weighing eight tons and a half has been constructed upon the Julien system by Messrs ElwellParker In the trial the electric locomotive successfully re placed the steamtram engine now in use upon the Birminghan tramways The gradients in many places are steep rising to I in I7 but the electric locomotive successfully mounted this steep and long ascent with a load of sixty passengers at a speed of about five miles an hour On the level and down hill the speed could be increased to ten miles an hour without difficulty and the locomo tive was started stopped and backed with ease The engine itself is a very neat and compact arrangement compared with the ordi nary tramengines Two rows of accumulators occupy each side between which is the alley for the driver where is fixed the switchv the reversingswitch the enginebrake and the carbrake The switch connects the cells in five sets all parallel and two three or four in series The cells number I04 having 39 plates each 9P inches by 6 inches The motor is placed low down and is con nected to the axles by helical gearing geared I to 8 The en gine is capable of exerting 40horse power and will run sixty or seventy miles A contract has been entered into by the engineers to run this car for three months at twelve cents per carmile the present cost of steam being nearly sixteen cents ELECTRICLIGHTING The establishment of central stations for the distribution of incandescent electriclighting has received a noticeable impetus through the successful introduction of the alternating current and transformer method of distribution The saving in the cost of conductors effected by this method due to the employment of relatively high potential currents in the mains has rendered it commercially practicable to distribute over much larger areas than formerly but over areas of relatively sparse con sumption Thus many small towns are enabled to maintain suc cessfully electriclighting stations The Westinghouse Electric Companyof Pittsburgh Penn introduced the alternatingcurrent system here after careful and thorough investigation and experi ment about two years ago installing the first commercial stationi at Buffalo NY and putting it in operation Thanksgiving Dayw I886 The number of centralstation plants since supplied or con tracted for by the Westinghouse Company has reached no fewer than one hundred and twentyfour They have recently received a contract for a station in the heart of London to include an outfit for twentvfive thousand lamos This contract is with the Metro politan Electrical Supply Company Limited the organization of which in London was noticed in electrical journals some months since AN ELECTRIC SURFACE ROAD IN NEW YORK The Bentley Knight Electric Railway Company will soon resume operations on the Fulton Street crosstown railway in this city and expect to have it in operation before the end of this month They began work on the road over a year ago but owing to the opposition of a SCIENCE VOL XII No 3SDECEMBER 7 I 888 SCIENCE 27I streetrailway whose track extended over a part of the route they were unable to proceed far with the work at that time In the BentleyKnight system the electric current is taken from conduc tors contained in and protected by subsurface conduitsa sys tem admirably adapted to the crowded thoroughfares of a busy city COMMERCIAL GEOGRAPHY The Obi Railroad THE question of opening the interior of Siberia becomes more and more important While hitherto the canals between the large rivers and projects of navigating the dangerous Kara Sea were foremost among the plans that seemed likely to be realized the project of a railroad from the lower Obi to the coast west of Nova Zembla has at present assumed definite shape The Russian news papers give the following reports of the project The Obi Railroad the most northern road ever planned will be of the greatest eco nomic importance to Siberia It deserves special attention as the projectors do not demand any subsidy or government guaranties The river MalaiaObi near Obdorsk is the startingpoint of the projected line which will take a direction towards the foothills of the Ural Mountains The latter will be crossed in one of the transversal valleys which are not over one hundred feet above sea level It will cross the river Ussa near its source and reach the ocean through the tundra of Bolchesemelsk Its terminus will be in the Bay of Shainoudir near Belcoff Nosse Tlae total length of the line will be 260 miles The price of construction including rolling stock is estimated at forty thousand dollars or ten million dollars the whole line The establishment of a port on the Arctic Ocean in the locality mentioned above with all modern improve ments for loading and unloading vessels is estimated at one and a half million dollars To this must be added the cost of establishing a line of riverboats on the Obi and Irtish which is estimated at two and a half million dollars Thus the whole plan requires the expenditure of fifteen million dollars in works of construction It is believed that the line can be worked for six months of the year The products of the remotest parts of the Obi basin will be carried to the shipping port on the ocean in twelve days while twelve days more will be sufficient to carry them to London The price per hundredweight is estimated at I30 while on the pres ent route vga Barnaul Perm St Petersburg London it is 225 the time necessary to accomplish this distance being I30 clays The railroad which has been projected by Mr Golovacheff is in tended as a means for making the transactions of a Siberian com mercial company which has been founded recently profitable According to the concession granted by the Russian Government this road will not be open to the public but will only be used by the grantee who proposes to export the grain and stock from southern Siberia and hopes to be able to furnish the London mar ket with north Siberian fish On the other hand the company will import principally machinery which so far has hardly found its way to Siberia and other articles which are at present imported by Moscow merchants NOTES AND NEWS SCREENED from the world by a high fence and not far from the Edison Laboratory at Orange NJ there have gone up two large factorybuildings In these buildings there are now in operation a hundred thousand dollars worth of such fine machinery as can be supplied by E E Garvin  Sons of New York Pratt  Whitney and Dwight Slater of Hartford and Brown  Sharpe of Providence in the manufacture of the parts of the improved phonograph The assembling of these will begin at an early date so that by Jan I one hundred phonographs should be leaving the works each day Lieut F W Toppan USN is the manager Lieut DBruun of the Danish army says Xavre having had a moss dug out in Finderup in Jutland has made sonle discoveries In the moss were found trunks of oak beech and fir trees from 6 to 30 inches in diameter The branches had in some cases been cut off but the bark remained By the side of one of the oak trunks two earthen vessels were discovered and near another a third shapec like an urn Irl the latter lay a sandal cut from a piece ofleather with flaps and leather straps for tying tothe ankle the length of the sandal being 7 inches  It seemed asif the trunks of trees had been placed in a certain position for some purpose or other About 20 feet farther to the south and at the same depth viz 6 feet a yoke of oak was found 51 feet long and 3 inches thick being fairly cylindrically cut out in the centre At each end were holes in one of which remained a strap of leather Other implements of oak were also found evidently used for carrying Some of them seemed part of a wheel Close to the yoke another earthen urn was discovered which like the three referred to was surrounded with sprigs of heather and bramble Formerly some horns of bullocks and the skeleton of a man in a fur coating were found in the moss The various objects are now in the Copen hagen Museum and are said to date from the early iron age Mr J W Osborne of Washington the wellknown inventor of photolithography has presented to the United States National Museum and to the Art Museum in Boston his large and exceed ingly valuable collection of proots and specimens illustrative of the development of photomechanical printing All the important and typical processes are fully represented in each by specimens col lected by Mr Osborne in all the art centres of Europe and America and include the works of all who have in any measure achieved success in the graphic arts As soon as it can be properly classi fied the collection intended for the National Museum will be placed on exhibition in the section of graphic arts Mr Osbornes con tribution the museum authorities assert has laid a substantial foundation for an exhaustive collection of kindred productions under government auspices at Washington The Philosophical Society of Washington will hold a meeting on Saturday evening Dec 8 at which an address will be delivered by the retiring president of the society Col Garrick Mallery on  Philosophy and Specialties  According to news received in Denmark Dr F Nansen has suc ceeded in crossing Greenland but unfortunately was too late to catch the last steamer It will be remembered that on July I 5 Dr Nansen accompanied by Lieutenant Sverdrup two other Scandina vians and two Lapps left the whaler s Jason  in latitude 65 north in sight of the east coast of Greenland After twelve days of diffi cult march across the packice the coast was reached but about sixty miles farther south than Dr Nansen expected to land the current having carried the ice southward On Aug I5 the party began the march across the inland ice taking a northwesterly direction towards Christianshaab When a height of about 7ooo feet was attained the travellers were overtaken by a northerly snowstorm which compelled them to take a westerly course to ward Godhaab The greatest altitude attained was about 9500 feet Finally after fortysix days of travel the party arrived at the head of Ameralik Fiord which is situated a little south of Godhaab and by means of an improvised float Godhaab was reached on Oct 4 Dr Nansen despatched immediately two kayaks with letters to Ivigtut from which place the steamer  Fox  was to leave about this time The kayaks leached this place when the steamer was about to leave and as the captain did not feel justified in delaying his departure on account of the advanced season the party will have to winter in Greenland At the meeting of the Roval Meteorological Society held on Nov 2I Mr G J Symons read a paper entitled  Results of an Investlgation of the Phenomena of English Thunderstorms during the Years I85759 This paper was written nearly thirty years ago It has now been communicated to the society at the request of the thunderstorm committee The paper contains a summary chiefly in statistical form of some of the results of an investigation into English thunderstorms and the accidents produced by light ning during the years I85759 The author found that in sheet lightning the most prevalent color is white then yellow blue and red in forked lightning the order is nearly reversed blue being more than twice as frequent as any other color then red white and most rarely yellow Sheet lightning was seen about twice as often as forked Dr A Riggenbach exhibited some photographs of cirrus and other fine clouds which had been obtained by using the surface of a lake as a polarizing mirror

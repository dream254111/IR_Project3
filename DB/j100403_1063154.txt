corpora tion borrowed money from an Illinois firm a deed of trust being given on the property of the corporation as security to a trustee in Illinois for the purpose of improving its property and

2 VA L REV 534 CONSTITUTIONAL LAWRELIGIOUS LIBERTYBIBLE READING IN PUBLIC SCHOOLSA state constitution provided that every person has the nat ural right to worship God according to the dictates of his own con science and that no preference shall ever be given to or discrimination made against any church sect or creed of religion Under a resolution passed by the board of school directors all teachers in the public schools of that district were requested to open the daily sessions with readings from the Bible without note or comment and also with the Lords Prayer The King James version of the Bible including both the New and Old Testament was the one actually used by the teachers Held this is an unlawful discrimination against Jews but not against Roman Catholics Hcrold v Board of School Directors La 68 South 116 The untrammelled right of each person to worship God according to the dictates of his own conscience is a fundamental part of the rights guaranteed by American freedom See State v School Board 76 Wis 177 44 N W 967 and cases cited But the Constitution of the United States makes no provision for protecting the citizens of the re spective states in their religious liberties save as to legislation by Con gress and the control of these matters is left to the legislatures of the several states subject only to the restrictions imposed by the respec tive state constitutions Permoli v First Municipality 44 U S 589 The weight of authority seems to be opposed to the doctrine of the principal case Hackett v School District 120 Ky 608 87 S W 792 Pfeiffer v Board of Education 118 Mich 560 77 N W 250 42 L R A 536 Thus it would seem that under the usual constitutional pro visions the reading of the Bible in the public schools without note or comment by the teacher is not a violation of the right to worship God or not to do so according to ones own conscience Church v Bullock Tex Civ App 100 S W 1025 16 L R A N S 860 and note Moore v Monroe 64 Ia 367 20 N W 475 Hackett v School District supra This is not a form of sectarian instruction since it is intended merely to acquaint the school children with those fundamental princi ples of morality and good conduct recognized by Christian peoples as necessary attributes of good citizenship Pfeiffer v Board of Education supra But in some states Bible reading in the public schools is re garded as religious discrimination People v Board of Education 152RECENT DECISIONS 245 Ill 334 92 N E 251 State v School Board supra A distinction has been made however between the reading of the Bible as a form of religious worship and as a mere class exercise State v Scheve 65 Neb 853 93 N W 169 The principal case takes the minority view and the distinction made therein that the reading of the Bible is unconstitutional as to Jews but not as to Roman Catholics would appear unsound The wrong if any arises not out of the particular version of the Bible but in the com pulsion to join in any form of worship State v Scheve supra CORPORATE STOCKLIFE TENANTEXTRAORDINARY DIVIDENDSA testator bequeathed the revenue from certain corporate stocks to defendant during life After the testators death the corporation declared an extraordinary cash dividend payable in stock at the option of its stock holders which the defendant claims as revenue Held the defendants claim is proper Humphrey v Lang N C 86 S E 526 See 1 VA L REV 138 CRIMINAL LAWHOMICIDECOEXISTENCE OF EXPRESS MALICE AND IR RESISTIBLE PASSIONA homicide took place under such circumstances as to cast doubt upon the condition of the defendants mind at the time of the killing At the trial the jury was instructed that irresistible passion if proved to have existed was insufficient to reduce the de gree of the offense if the killing was done with express malice Held irresistible passion and express malice cannot coexist State v Salgado Nev 150 Pac 764 Express malice in connection with homicide exists where an act is deliberately committed in the pursuance of a formed design to kill an other State v Roberts 2 Boyce Del 140 78 Atl 305 Martinez v State 30 Tex Cr App 129 16 S W 767 28 Am St Rep 895 Further the existence of deliberate malice being once ascertained its contin uance down to the time of the commission of the act will be presumed unless evidence is introduced showing that the wicked purpose was abandoned State v Johnson 23 N C 354 35 Am Dec 742 State v Tilly 25 N C 424 Riggs v State 30 Miss 635 Irresistible passion may be defined as that state of the mind in which men of average disposi tion act rashly or without due deliberation or reflection and from pas sion rather than judgment Mahr v People 10 Mich 220 State v John son 129 Wis 146 108 N W 55 5 L R A N S 809 Uncontrollable and ungovernable temper is no excuse for a crime and does not reduce the killing to manslaughter unless it arises from immediate and legally sufficient provocation Comm v Eckert 174 Pa St 137 34 Atl 305 Henning v State 106 Ind 386 6 N E 803 55 Am Rep 756 Reese v State 90 Ala 624 8 So 818 Homicide cannot be both malicious and in the heat of passion Malice essential to murder in the first degree and passion essential to manslaughter cannot coexist at law since the for mer implies a mind under the sway of reason while the latter results from a temporary loss of mental control Brown v Comm 86 Va

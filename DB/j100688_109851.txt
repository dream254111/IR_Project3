Opposition to Gravity Abstract,i207044,38 in the computation No hypothesis is introduced into the process and therefore no correction of error by trial is requisite Of three methods proposed one combines the advantages of Keills series and Cassinis approximation together and is regarded by the author as the most simple in theory and most expeditious in prac tice which has yet been proposed Demonstrations of the late Dr Maskelynes Formule for finding the Longitude and Latitude of a celestial Object from its Right Ascension and Declination andforfinding its RightAscension and Declination from its Longitude and Latitude the obliquity of the Ecliptic being given in both cases By the Rev Abram Robertson DD FRS Savilian Professor of Astronomy in the University of Oxford and Radcliffian Observer Communicated by the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart GCB PRS Read February 15 1816 Phil Trans 1816 p 138 Dr Robertson conceives that no full demonstration of these for mulah has yet been published and hence no one has hitherto remarlted two oversights with respect to their application to certain particular cases which had escaped the notice of their author Their value however has been duly appreciated by those most competent to judge of their merit especially by M Delambre who remarks upon their conciseness as well as precision in comparison even with the formulae given by Lalande Some Account of the Feet of those Animals whose progressive Motion can be carried on in opposition to Gravity By Sir Everard Home Bart VPRS Read February 22 1816 Phil Trans 1816 p 149 The power which flies have of crawling upon a ceiling is well known but the mode in which this is effected says the author has never been explained It was not till lately he learned that there are animals of a larger size which have the same power and in which from their size the construction of their feet will admit of more ac curate examination The Lacerta Gecko of Java walks up and down the smoothly po lished chinam walls in quest of flies and runs upwards to its retreat in the roofs of the houses although the weight of a specimen given to the author by Sir Joseph Banks was as much as 5I ounces On the feet of this animal are five toes armed with a very sharp and curved claw and there are also on each sixteen transverse slits with serrated edges with pouches between them which are consi dered by the author as the striking peculiarity in the foot of this lizard When these are closed the under surface of the foot bears a considerable resemblance to the upper part of the head of the sucking fish the surface of which is furnished with two rows of moveable plates attached by one edge and serrated at the other and39 its margin is surrounded by a broad loose membrane capable of very close application to any surface on which it is placed By elevation of the plates a degree of exhaustion is thus occa sioned and the fish thereby firmly attaches himself to the shark or to any other object In the same manner it would appear that the transverse serratures of the bottom of the toes of the lizard by their elevation occasion a degree of exhaustion or partial vacuum confined by the broad mem brane which is attached all round each of the toes The author is of opinion that the feet of the common fly act upon the same principle Their under surfaces when highly magnified appear to be concave as they are represented by Kellar and he thinks it cannot be doubted that these cavities are employed to rarify the air between them and the surfaces to which they are applied and thus support the weiglit of the fly in opposition to gravity when suspended from a ceiling On the Communication of the Structure of doublyrefracting Crystals to Glass Muriate of Soda Fluor Spar and other Substances by mechanical Compression and Dilatation By David Brewster LLD FRS Lond and Edin In a Letter addressed to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart GCB PRS Read February 29 1816 Phil Trans 1816 p 156 The subjects here chosen for experiment are such bodies as have in general no power of polarizing or depolarizing light and the means employed for communicating these properties are purely me chanical In the first instance a piece of plateglass was taken and compressed edgewise between two screws and was found to polarize light in every part of its breadth with depolarizing axes making an angle of 450 witli the edges of the plate When a narrow slip of plateglass is attempted to be bent edge wise the inner edge becomes compressed sufficiently to produce the effect of depolarization and the exterior edge of the curve by being dilated also depolarizes but the characters of the fringes of colour produced in the two cases are different since those which arise from compression are such as are produced by calcareous spar and beryl but those caused by dilatation of the exterior edge are such as appear from the action of sulphate of lime quartz and other bodies of that class The author observes that the tints polarized ascend in Newtons scale in proportion as the forces of compression or dilatation are in creased When two plates under a state of compression are combined trans versely the same phenomena are exhibited as by means of a plate formed of a doublyrefracting crystal The effect of two plates of compressed glass similarly placed is the same as that of a double llate  but if they be placed transversely then the tints are such as are due to the difference of their thick

j100000,Science,1627544,The Early History of the Lateral Line and Auditory Anlages in Amia,i295703,APRIL 11 1902 by irregularities of the surface of the water Such images are small black spots orange or yellow bordered 3 It was pointed out that in the male of Eupomotis gibbosus the colors are much brighter than in the female The ver micular markings on the cheeks of the male are more brilliant than those of the female the opercular earflap is larger and bor dered with scarlet and blue the ventrals of the male are black while those of the female are yellow the dorsal and caudal of the male are much more brilliantly blue than those of the female In approaching the female in order to induce her to enter his nest to spawn the male elevates or puffs out the gill covers so as to display their brilliant markings At the same time the opercular earflaps are erected and the black ventral fins spread out When in this attitude the male faces the female and it is when seen from the front that his display of color is most brilliant He assumes a similar attitude when threat ening other males He was never seen to assume this attitude except under the cir cumstances described so that the display of color resulting from the attitude must be regarded as a means of expressing the emotions The Early History of the Lateral Line and Auditory Anlages in Amia CORA J BECKWITH Presented by Jacob Reig hard No common anlage of the auditory pit and lateral line system such as has been described in Teleosts by Wilson was found in Amia The auditory pit was found to arise much earlier than the lateral line system and in the usual way It is at first imbedded in an elongated mass of mesectoblast proliferated from the neural crest This mass of mesectoblast with enclosed auditory pit bears a considerable resemblance to the common anlage of auditory pit and lateral line system re ferred to above It subsequently extends into the adjacent gill arches where its further history was not followed The lateral line system makes its appearance at a later stage in the form of several inde pendent ridgelike thickenings of the ecto blast which subsequently fuse It is at no time connected with the anlage of the audi tory pit The Vascular System of the Common Squid Loligo pealii L W WILLIAMS The knowledge of the histology of the vascular system of decapod mollusks is very incomplete especially in reference to the extent of the capillary system In addition to the capillaries lacunae have been believed to intervene between the arteries and veins The extent of the capillary system was determined by inject ing the vascular system with Berlin blue and the lining of the vessels was studied by means of silver impregnations Both the arterial and branchial hearts seem to lack an endothelium The branchial heart consists of striated muscle and apparently secretory polygonal cells The intrinsic muscle of the peristaltically contractile arteries resembles connective tissue The arteries and veins are connected in all parts of the squid by capillaries All the vessels are lined by an endothelium The veins are connected with small endsinuses which enclose the terminal branches of the arterioles and receive numerous capillaries some of which arise from the perforating arteriole The socalled lapunea which par tially enclose the pharynx and eyes are sinuses since they have endothelial walls and since they intervene between veins not between veins and arteries The wide distribution of the capillary vessels the presence of an endothelium around every bloodcontaining cavity except possibly the heart and the absence 675 SCIENCE

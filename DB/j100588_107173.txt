J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107173,ON THE DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM,I206960,233 3 XVBI ON THE DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM BY WILLIAM HERSCHEL LL D F R S READ MAY I6 1805 0OUR ATTENTION HAS LATELY BEEN DIRECTED AGAIN TO THE CONSTRUCE TION OF THE HEAVENS ON WHICH I HAVE ALREADY DELIVERED SEVERAL DETACHED PAPERS THE CHANGES WHICH LEAVE TAKEN PEACE IN THE RELATIVE POSITION OF DOUBLE STARS HAVE ASCERTAINED MOTIONS IN MANY OF THEM WHICH ARE PROBABLY OF THE SAME NATURE WITH THOSE THAT HAVE HITHERTO BEEN CALLED PROPER MOTIONS IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT MANY OF THE PRINCIPAL STARS HAVE BEEN FOUND TO HAVE CHANGRED THEIR SITUATION AND WE HAVE LATELY HAD A MOST VALUABLE ACQUISITION IN DR MASKELYNES TABLE OF PROPER MOTIONS OF SIX AND THIRTY OF THEM IF THIS TABLE AFFORDS US A PROOF OF THE MOTION OF THE STARS OF THE FIRST BRIGHTNESS SUCH AS ARE PROBABLY IN OUR IMMEDIATE NEIGHBOURHOOD THE CHANGES OF THE POSITION OF MINUTE DOUBLE STARS THAT I HAVE ASCERTAINED MANY OF WHICH CAN ONLY BE SEEN BY THE BEST TELESCOPES LIKEWISE PROVE THAT MOTIONS ARE EQUALLY CARRIED ON IN THE REMOTEST PARTS OF SPACE WHICH HITHERTO WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PENETRATE THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE STARS HAVE LONG ENGAGE THE ATTENTION OF ASTRONOMERS AND IN THE YEAR 1783 I DEDUCED FROM THEM WITH A HIGH DEGREE OF PROBABILITY A MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM TOWARDS A HERCULIS THE REASONS WHICH WERE THEN POINTED OUT FOR INTRODUCING A SOLAR MOTION WILL NOW BE MUCH STRENGTHENED BY ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS AND THE MDCCCV H H1234 DR HERSCHELOF THE DIRECTION OF THE ABOVE MENTIONED TABLE OF WELL ASCERTAINED PROPER MOTIONS WILL ALSO ENABLE US TO ENTER RIGOROUSLY INTO THE NECESSARY CALCULA TIONS FOR ASCERTAINING ITS DIRECTION AND DISCOVERING ITS VELOCITY WHEN THESE POINTS ARE ESTABLISHED WE SHALL BE PREPARED TO DRAW SOME CONSEQUENCES FROM THEM THAT WILL ACCOUNT FOR MANY PHENOMENA WHICH OTHERWISE CANNOT BE EXPLAINED THE SCOPE OF THIS PAPER WHEREIN IT IS INTENDED TO ASSIGN NOT ONLY THE DIRECTION BUT ALSO THE VELOCITY OF THE SOLAR MOTION EMBRACES AN EXTENSIVE FIELD OF OBSERVATION AND CALCULATION BUT AS TO GIVE THE WHOLE OF IT WOULD EXCEED THE COMPASS OF THE PRESENT SHEETS I SHALL RESERVE THE VELOCITY OF THE SOLAR MOTION FOR AN EARLY FUTURE OPPORTUNITY AND PROCEED NOW TO A DISQUI SITION OF THE FIRST PART OF MY SUBJECT WHICH IS THE DIRECTION OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM REASONS FOR ADMITTING A SOLAR MOTION IT MAY APPEAR SINGULAR THAT AFTER HAVING ALREADY LONG AGO POINTED OUT A SOLAR MOTION AND EVEN FIXED UPON A STAR TOWARDS WHICH I SUPPOSED IT TO BE DIRECTED I SHOULD AGAIN THINK IT NE CESSARY TO SHOW THAT WE HAVE MIANY SUBSTANTIAL REASONS FOR ADMITTING SUCH A MOTION AT ALL WHAT HAS INDUCED ME TO ENTER INTO THIS INQUIRY IS THAT SOME OF THE CONSEQUENCES HEREAFTER TO BE DRAWN FROM A SOLAR MOTION WHEN ESTABLISHED SEEM TO CON DRADICT THE VERY INTENTION FOR WHICH IT IS TO BE INTRODUCED THE CHIEF OBJ ECT IN VIEW WHEN A SOLAR MOTION WAS PROPOSED TO BE DEDUCED FROM OBSERVATIONS OF THE PROPER MOTIONS OF STARS WAS TO TAKE AWAY MANY OF THESE MOTIONS BY INVESTING THE SUN WITH A CONTRARY ONE BUT THE SOLAR MOTION WHEN ITS EXISTENCE HAS BEEN PROVED WILL REVEAL SO MANY CONCEALED REAL MOTIONS THAT WE SHALL HAVE A GREATER SUM OF THEM THAN IT WOULD BE NECESSARYMOTION OF TIW SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM TO ADMIT IF THE SUN WERE AT REST AND TO REMOVE THIS OBJECTION THE NECESSITY FOR ADMITTING ITS MOTION OUGHT TO BE WELL ESTABLISHED THEORETICAL CONSIDERALIONS A VIEW OF THE MOTION OF THE MOONS OR SECONDARY PLANETS ROUND THEIR PRIMARY ONES AND OF THESE AGAIN ROUND THE SUN MAY SUGGEST THE ID AOF AN ADDITIONAL MOTION OF TAHE LATTER ROUND SOME OTHER UNKNOWN CENTER AND TOSE WHO LIKE TO INDULGE IN FANCIFUL REVIEWS OF THE HEAVENS MIGHT EASILY BUILD A SYSTEM UPON HYPOTHESES NOT ALTOGETHER WITHOUT SOME PLAUSIBILITY IN THEIR FAVOUR ACCORDINGLY WE FIND THAT MR LAMBERT IN A WORK WHICH IS FULL OF THE MOST FANTASTIC IMAGI NATIONS HAS FRAMED A SYSTEM WHEREIN THE SUN IS SUPPOSED TO MOVE ABOUT THE NEBULA IN ORION BUT SETTING ASIDE THE EXTRA VAGANT IDEA OF MAKING THIS LUMINOUS SPOT A CENTER OF MOTION IT MUST CERTAINLY BE ADMITTED THAT THE SOLAR MOTION ITSELF IS AT LEAST A VERY POSSIBLE EVENT I HAVE ALREADY MENTIONED IN A NOTE TO MY FORMER PAPER THAT THE POSSIBILITY OF A SOLAR MOTION HAS ALSO BEEN SHOWN FROM THEORETICAL PRINCIPLES BY THE LATE DR WILSON OF GLASGOW AND ITS PROBABILITY AFTERWARDS FROM REASONS OF THE SAME NATURE BY MR DE LA LANDE THE ROTATORY MOTION OF THE SUN FROM WHICH HE CONCLUDES A DISPLACING OF THE SOLAR CENTER MUST CER TAINLYBE ALLOWED TO INDICWTE A MOTION OF TRANSLATION IN SPAC  FOR THOUGH IT MAY BE POSSIBLE IT DOES NOT APPEAR PROBABE THAT ANY MECHANICAL IMPRESSION SHOULD HAVE GIVEN THE FORMER WITHOUT OCCASIONING THE LATTER BUT AS WE ARE INTIRELY UNAC QUAINTED WITH THE CAUSE OF THE ROTATORY MOTION THE SOLAR  SEE SYSME DU MONDE DE MR LAMBERT PAGE I5 AND I5 F SEE PHIL TRANS FOR THE YEAR 1783 PAGE 283 HH XDR HERSCNL ON THE DIRECTION OF THE TRANSLATION IN SPACE FROM THEORETICAL REASONS CAN ONLY BE ADMITTED AS A VERY PLAUSIBLE HYPOTHESIS IT WOULD BE WORTH WHILE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE FIXED INSTRUCT MENTS TO STRENGTHEN THIS ARGUMENT BY OBSERVING THE STARS WHICH ARE KNOWN TO CHANGE THEIR MAGNITUDES PERINODICALLY FOR AS WE HAVE GREAT REASON TO ASCRIBE THESE REGULAR CHANGES TO A ROTATORY MOTION OF THE STARS A REAL MOTION IN SPACE MAY BE EXPECTED TO ATTEND IT AND THE NUMBER OF THESE STARS IS SO CONSIDERABLE THAT THEIR CONCURRING TESTIMONY WOULD BE VERY DESIRABLE PERHAPS ALGOL WHICH ACCORDING TO THESE IDEAS MUST HAVE A VERY QUICK ROTATORY MOTION MAY BE FOUND TO HAVE ALSO A COI SIDERABLE PROGRESSIVE ONE AND IF THAT SHOULD BE ASCERTAINED THE POSITION OF THE AXIS OF THE ROTATION OF THIS STAR WILL BE IN A GREAT MEASURE THEREBY DISCOVERED AN ARGUMENT FROM THE REAL MOON TO A ROTATORY ONE IS NEARLY OF EQUAL VALIDITY AND THEREFORE ALL THE STARS THAT HAVE A MOTION IN SPACE MAY BE SURMISED TO HAVE ALSO A ROTATION ON THEIR AXES SYMPTOMS OF PARALLARTIC MOTIO NS BUT SETTING ASIDE THEORETICAL ARGUMENTS I SHALL NOW PROCEED TO SUCH AS MAY BE DRAWN FROM OBSERVATION ANLD AS ALL PARALE LACTIC MOTIONS ARE EVIDENT INDICATIONS THAT THE OBSERVER COF THEM IS NOT AT REST IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO EXPLAIN THREE SORTS OF MOTIONS OF WHICH THE PARALLACTIC IS ONE THEY WB ILBL OFTEN ENGAGE OUR ATTENTION IN THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION LET THE SUN BE SUPPOSED TO MOVE TOWARDS A CERTAIN PART OF THE HEAVENS AND SINCE THE WHOLE SOLAR SYSTEM WILL HAVE THE  SEE BHIL TRANS FOR THE YEAR 795 PAGE 68MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM 37 SAME MOTION THE STARS MUST APPEAR TO AN INHABITANT OF THE EARTH TO MOVE IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN THE TRIANGLE SP A PLATE VII FIG 1 LET S P REPRESENT THE PARALLACTIC MOTION OF A STAR  THEN IF THIS STAR IS ONE THAT HAS NO REAL MOTIONR SP WILL ALSO BE ITS APPARENT MOTION BUT IF THE STAR IN THE SAME TIME THAT BY ITS PARALLACTIC MOTION IT WOULD HAVE GONE FROM S TO P SHOULD HAVE A REAL MOTION WHICH WOULD HAVE CARRIED IT FROM S TO R THEN WILL IT BE SEEN TO MOVE ALONG THE DIAGONAL S A OF THE PARALLELOGRAM S R A AND P A WHICH IS PARALLEL AND EQUAL TO SR WILL REPRESENT ITS REAL MOTION THEREFORE IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED TRIANGLE SFP A WHICH I SUPPOSE TO BE FORMED IN THE CONCAVE PART OF THE HEAVENS BY THREE ARCHES OF GREAT CIRCLES THE EYE OF THE OBSERVER BEING IN THE CENTER THE THREE SIDES WILL REPRESENT OR STAND FOR THE THREE MOTIONS I HAVE NAMED SP THE PARALLACTIC PA THE REAL AND SA THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE STAR THE SITUATION AND LENGTH OF THESE ARCHES IN SECONDS OF A DEGREE WILL EXPRESS OR RATHER REPRESENT NOT ONLY THE CDIRECTION BUT ALSO THE QUANTITY OF EACH MOTION SUCH AS IT MUST APPEAR TO AN EYE IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED CENTRAL SITUATION AND CALLING THE SOLAR MOTION S THE DISTANCE OF THE STAR FROM THE SUN D AND THE SINE OF THE STARS DISTANCE FROM TTHE POINTTOWVARDS WHICH THE SUN IS MOVING P THE PARALLACTIC MOTION WHEN THESE ARE GIVEN WILL BE HAD BY THE EXPRESSION ODS SP THIS THEOREM AND ITS COROLLARIES OF WHICH FREQUENT USE WILL BE MADE HEREAFTER IT W11 NOT BE NECESSARY HERE TO DEM ONSTRATE WHEN I CALL THE ARCH PA THE REAL MOTION IT SHOULD BE UNDER STOOD THAT I ONLY MEAN ITS REPRESENTATIVE FOR IT MUST BE EVIC DENT THAT THE ABSOLUTE MOTION OF A STAR IN SPACE AS WELL AS ITS INTRINSIC VELOCITY WILL STILL REMAIN UNKNOWN BECAUSE THE INCLI NATION OF THAT MOTION ON WHICH ALSO ITS REAL VELOCITY WILLDR HERSCHEL 0F THE DIRECTION OF THE DEPEND ADMITS OF THE GREATEST VARIETY OF DIRECTIONS WE ARE ONLY ACQUAINTED WITH THE PLANE IN WHICH THE MOTION MUST BE PERFORMED AND WITH THE LENGTH OF THE ARCH IN SECONDS BY WHICH THAT MOTION MAY BE MEASURED WE MAY ADD THAT THE CHORDS OF THE ARCHES REPRESENTING THE THREE MOTIONS ARE THE SMALLEST VELOCITIES OF THESE MOTIONS THAT CAN BE ADMITTED FOR IN EVERY OTHER DIRECTION BUT AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE LINE OF SIGHT THE ACTUAL SPACE OVER WHICH THE STAR WILL MOVE MUST BE GREATER THAN THE ARCH OR CHORD BY WHICH ITS MOTION IS REPRESENTED NOW SINCE A MOTION OF THE SUN WILL OCCASION PARALLACTIC MOTIONS OF THE STARS IT FOLLOWS THAT THESE AGAIN MUST INDICATE A SOLAR MOTION BUT IN ORDER TO ASCERTAIN WHETHER PARALLACTIC MOTIONS EXIST WE OUGHT TO EXAMINE THOSE STARS WHICH ARE MOST LIABLE TO BE VISIBLY AFFECTED BY SOLAR MOTION THIS REQUISITE POINTS OUT THE BRIGHTEST STARS AS THE MOST PROPER FOR OUR PUR POSE FOR ANY STAR MAY HAVE A GREAT REAL MOTION BUT IN ORDER TO HAVE A GREAT PARALLACTIC ONE IT MUST BE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF THE SUN  AND AS WE CAN ONLY JUDGE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE STARS BY THEIR SPLENDOUR WE OUGHT TO CHOOSE THE BRIGHTEST ON ACCOUNT OF A PROBABILITY THAT BEING NEARER THAN FAINT ONES THEY MAY BE MORE WITHIN THE REACH OF PARALLAX AND THUS BETTER QUALIFIED TO SHOW ITS EFFECTS WE ARE ALSO TO LOOK OUT FOR A CRITERION WHEREBY PARALLACTIC MAY BE DISTINGUISHED FROM REAL MOTIONS AND THIS WE FIND IN THEIR DIRECTIONS FOR IF A SOLAR MOTION EXISTS ALL PARALLACTIC MOTIONS WILL TEND TO A POINT IN OPPOSITION TOO THE DIRECTION OF THAT MOTION WHEREAS REAL MOTIONS WILL BE DISPERSED INDISCRI MINATELY TO ALL PARTS OF SPACE WITH THESE DISTINCTIONS IN VIEW WE MAY EXAMINE THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE PRINCIPALS STARS FOR THESE IF THE SUN IS NOT ATMOTION OF THE SAN AND SOL AR SYSTEM 239 REST MUST EITHER BE INTIRELY PARALLACTIC OR AT LEAST COMPOSED OF REAL AND PARALLACTIC MOTIONS IN THE LATTER CASE THEY WILL FALL UNDER THE DENOMINATION OF ONE OF THE THREE MOTIONS WE HAVE DEFINED NAMELY SA THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE STAR IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS PRINCIPLE I HAVE DELINEATED THE MEETING OF THE ARCHES ARISING FROM A CALCULATION OF THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE 36 STARS IN DR MASKELYNES CATALOGUE ON A CELESTIAL GLOBE AND AS ALL GREAT CIRCLES OF A SPHERE INTERSECT EACH OTHER IN TWO OPPOSITE POINTS IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO DISTI NGUISH THEM BOTH FOR IF THE SUN MOVES TO ONE OF THEM IT MAY BE CALLED THE APEX OF ITS MOTION AND AS THE STARS WILL THEN HAVE A PARAL LACTIC MOTION TO THEOPPOSITE ONE THE APPELLATION OF A PARALLACTIC CENTER MAY VERY PROPERLY BE GIVEN TO IT THE LATTER FALLING INTO THE SOUTHERN HEMISPHERE AMONG CONSTELLATIONS NOT VISIBLE TO US I SHALL ONLY MENTION THEIR OPPOSITE INTERSECTIONS ANDOF THESE I FIND NO LESS THAN TEN THAT ARE MADE BY STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE IN A VERY LIMITED PART OF THE HEAVENS ABOUT THE CONSTELLATION OF HERCULES UPON ALL THE REMAINING SURFACE OF THE SAME GLOBE THERE IS NOT THE LEAST APPEARANCE OF ANY OTHER THAN A PROMISCUOUS SITUATION OF INTERSECTIONS AND OF THESE ONLY A SINGLE ONE IS MADE BY ARCHES OF PRINCIPAL STARS THE TEN INTERSECTING POINTS MADE BY THE BRIGHTEST STARS ARE AS FOLLOWS THE 1ST IS BY SIRIUS AND ARCTURUS IN THE MOUTH OF THE DRAGON THE 2D BY SIRIUS AND CAPELLA NEAR THE FOLLOWING HAND OF HERCULES THE ID BY SIRIUS AND LYRA BETWEEN THE HAND AND KNEE OF HERCULES THE 4TH BY SIRIUS AND ALDEBARAN IN THE FOLLOWING LEG OF HERCULES THE 5TH BY

6O 59 344 WE MIGHT REST SATISFIED WITH HAVING SHOWN THAT THE PARADE LACTIC EFFECT OF WHICH WE ARE IN SEARCH IS PLAINLY TO BE PER CEIVED IN THE MOTION OF THE BRIGHTEST STARS HOWEVER BY WAY OF FURTHER CONFIRMATION WE MAY TAKE IN SOME LARGE STARS OF THE NEXT ORDER IN WHOSE MOTIONS EVIDENT MARKS OF THE IN FLUENCE OF PARALLAX MAY LIKEWISE BE PERCEIVED WHEN THE INTERSECTIONS MADE BY THEIR PROPER MOTIONS AND THE ARCHES IN WHICH THE STARS OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE ARE MOVING ARE EXA MINED WE FIND NO LESS THAN FIFTEEN WHICH UNITE WITH THE FORMER TEN IN POINTING OUT THE SAME PART OF THE HEAVENS AS A PARAL LACTIC CENTER IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT ONLY TO MENTION THE OPPOSITEMOTION OF THE SUN AVND SOLAR SYSTEMN 241 POINTS OF THE SITUATION OF THESE INTERSECTIONS AND THE STARS BY WHICH THEY ARE MADE WITHOUT GIVING A CALCULATED TABLE OF THEM THE 1ST IS THE FOLLOWING LEG OF HERCULES AND IS MADE BY SIRIUS AND A3 TAURI THE 2D IS ALSO IN THE FOLLOWING LEG OF HERCULES BY SIRIUS AND ANDROMEDE THE D IS

ANDROMEDAX AND THE I5TH NEAR THE FOLLOWING ARM OF HERCULES IS MADE BY PROCYON AND A ARIETIS AN ARGUMENT LIKE THIS FOUNDED UPON THE MOST AUTHENTIC OBSERVATIONS AND SUPPORTED BY THE STRICTEST CALCULATIONS CAN HARDLY FAIL OF BEING CONVINCING AND THOUGH ONLY THE TEN PRINCIPAL APICES OF THE TWENTYFIVE THAT ARE GIVEN HAVE BEEN CALCULATED THE OTHER FIFTEEN MAY NEVERTHELESS BE DEPENDED UPON AS TRUE TO LESS THAN ONE DEGREE OF THE SPHERE MDCCCV IDR HRCSHEL 4 THE DIRECTIP4 OF TKE CHANGES IN THE POSITION OF DOUBLE STARS WE HAVE LATELY SEEN THAT THE ALTERATIONS IN THE RELATIVE SITUATION OF A GREAT NUMBER OF DOUBLE STARS MAY BE ACCOUNTED FOR BY A PARALLACTIC MOTION AMONG THE 56 STAS WHICH I HAVE GIVEN THE CHANGES OF MORE THANHALF OF THEM APPAR TO BE OF THIS NATURE AND IT WILL CERTAINLY BE MORE ELIGIBLE TO ASCRIBE THEM TO THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX THAN TO ADMIT SO MANY SEPARATE MOTIONS IN THE DIFFERENT STARS ESPECIALLY WH ENIT IS CONSIDERED THAT IF THE ALTERATIONS OF THE DANGLE OF POSITION ERE OWING TO A MOTION OF THE LARGEST STAR OF EACH SET THE DIRECTION OF SUCH MOTIONS MUST IN CONTRADICTION TO ALL PROBABILITY TEND NEARLY TO QNE PARTICULAR PART OF THE HEAVENS THIS ARGUMENT DRAWN FROM THE CHANGE OF THE POSITION OF DOUBLE STARS MAY BE CONSIDERED AS DERIVING ITS VALIDITY FROM THE SAME SOURCE WITH THE FORMER NAMELY THE PARALLACTIC NOTIONS OF AT LEAST 28 MORE STARS POINTING OUT THE SAME APEX OF A SOLAR MOTION BY THEIR DIRECTION TO ITS OPPOSITE PARALLACTIC CENTER INCONGRUITY OF PROPER MOTIONS IT MAY BE REMARKED THAT THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE STARS IF THEY WERE IN REALITY SUCH AS THEY APPEAR TO BE WOULD CONTAIN A CERTAIN INCONGRUOUS MIXTURE OF GREAT VELOCITY AND EXTREME SLOWNESS ARCTURUS ALONE DESCRIBES ANNUALLY AN ARCH OF MORE THAN TWO SECONDS ALDEBARAN HARDLY ONETENTH AND A QUARTER QF A SECOND RIGEL LITTLE MORE THAN ONETENT AND A HALF EVEN LYRA MOVES BARELY THREE AND A QUARTER TENTHS OF A SECOND WHILE PROCYON HAS ALMOST FOUR TIMES THAT VELOCITY OUT OF  STARS WHOSE PROPER MOTION WE HAVE EXAMINED THERE ARE IS THAT DO NOT REACH TWOTENTHS OF A SECOND 1 VIRGINIS MOVESMOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM 243 SEVERITYSEVEN HUNDREDTHS AND A CYGNI ONLY SIX BUT IT WILL BE SHOWN WHEN THE DIRECTION AND VELOCITY OF THAT SOLAR MOTION CCME TO BE EXPLAINED THAT THESE KIND OF INCONGRUITIES ARE MERE PARALLACTIC APPEARANCES AND THAT THERE IS SO GENERAL A CON SISTENCY AMONG THE REAL MUTIONS OF THE STARS THAT ARCTURUS IS IN NO RESPECT SINGLED OUT AS A STAR WHOSE MOTION IS FAR BEYOND THE REST BY GIVING THLIS REMARK A PLACE AMONG THE REASONS FOR ADMIT TING A SOLAR MOTION IT IS NOT INTENDED TO LAY ANY PARTICULAR STRESS UPON IT FOR IT MAY BE OBJECTED THAT OUR IDEA OF THE CONGRUENCE OR HARMONY OF THE CELESTIAL MOTIONS CAN BE NO CRITERION OF THEIR REAL FITNESS AND SYMNIETRY BUT WHEN SUCH DISCORDANT PROPER MOTIONS AS THOSE I HAVE MENTIONED IN STARS OF NO VERY DIFFERENT LUSTRE ARE UNDER CONSIDERATION AND MAY BE EASILY SHOWN TO BE ONLY PARALLACTIC PHENOMENA THE METHOD BY WHICH THIS CAN BE DONE MUST CERTAINLY APPEAR ELIGIBLE AND WHEN ADDED TO MANY OTHER INDUCEMENTS WILL THROW SOME SHARE OF WEIGHT INTO THE SCALE SIDEREAL OCCULTATION OF A SMALLL STAR OF NEARLY THE SAME IMPORTANCEF WITH THE FORMER ARGUMENT IS THE ACCOUNT OF THE OCCULTATION OF A SMALL STAR BY A LARGE ONE WHICH I HAVE GIVEN IN MY LAST PAPER WHEN THE SOLAR MOTION HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED WE SHALL PROVE THAT THE VANISHING OF THE SMALL STAR NEAR G CYGNI AS FAR AS WE CAN JUDGE AT PRESENT IS ONLY A PARALLACTIC DISAPPEARANCE IT MUST BE GRANTED THAT A REAL MOTION OF THE LARGE STAR WOULD ALSO EXPLAIN THE SAME PHENO MENON BUT THEN AGAIN THIS STAR MUST BE SUPPOSED TO MOVE TO WARDS THE VERY SAME PARALLACTIC CENTER WHICH THE CHANGES IN THE II XT44 DR HIRSCATEL0ON THE DIMRTIOYON OF THEI POSITION OF OTHER DOUBLE STARS POINT OUT AND THISCANNOT BE PROBABLE  DIRECTION OF THE SOLAR MOTION FROM WHAT HAS BEEN SAID I BELIEVE THE EXPEDIENCE OF AD MITFING A SOLAR MOTION WILL NOT BE CALLED IN QUESTION OUR NEXT ENDEAVOUR THEREFORE MUST BE TO INVESTIGATE ITS DIRECTION TO RETURN TO THE BEFORE MENTIONED INTERSECTIONS OF THE ARCHES IN WHICH THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE STARS ARE PERFORMED I SHALL BEGIN BY PROVING THAT WHEN THE PROPER MOTIONS OF TWO STARS ARE GIVEN AN APEX MAY BE FOUND TO WHICH IF THE SUN BE SUP POSED TO MOVE WITH A CERTAIN VELOCITY THE TWO GIVEN MOTIONS MAY THEN BE RESOLVED INTO APPARENT CHANGES ARISING FROM SIDEREAL PARALLAX THE STARS REMAINING PERFECTLY AT REST LET THE STARS BE ARCTURUS AND SIRIUS AND THEIR ANNUAL PROPER MOTIONS AS GIVEN IN THE ASTRONOMER ROYALS TABLES WHEN THE ANNUAL PROPER MOTION OF ARCTURUS WHICH IS G IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND  172 IN NORTH POLAR DISTANCE IS REDUCED BY A COMPOSITION OF MOTIONS TO A SINGLE ONE IT WILL BE IN A DIRECTION WHICH MAKES AN ANGLE OF 550 29 42 SOUTH PRECEDING WITH THE PARALLEL OF ARCTURUS AND OF A VELOCITY SO AS TO DESCRIBE ANNUALLY 2O87 18 OF A GREAT CIRCLE I THE ANNUAL PROPER MOTION OF SIRIUS O42 IN RIGHT ASCEN SION AND  1O4 IN NORTH POLAR DISTANCE BY THE SAME METHOD OF COMPOSITION BECOMES A MOTION OF 11 1528 IN A DIRECTION WHICH MAKES AN ANGLE OF 68 49 41 SOUTHPRECEDING WITH THE PARALLEL OF SIRIUS BY CALCULATION THE ARCHES IN WHICH THESE TWO STARS MOVE WHEN CONTINUED WILL MEET IN WHAT I HAVE CALLED THEIR PARALLACTIC CENTER WHOSE RIGHT ASCENSION IS 75 391 50 AND SOUTH POLARMOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM 2 4 DISTANCE IS 360 41 34 THE OPPOSITE OF THIS OR RIGHT ASCENSION 25539 50 AND NORTH POLAR DISTANCE 36 41 34 IS WHAT WE ARE TO ASSUME FOR THE REQUIRED APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION WHEN A STAR IS SITUATED AT A CERTAIN DISTANCE FROM THE SUN WHICH WE SHALL 1 CALL 1  AND 9O0 FROM THE APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION ITS PARALLACTIC MOTION WILL BE A MAXIMUM LET US NOW SUPPOSE THE VELOCITY OF THE SUN TO BE SUCH THAT ITS MOTION TO A PERSON SITUATED ON THIS STAR WOULD APPEAR TO DESCRIBE ANNUALLY AN ARCH OF 284825 OR WHICH IS THE SAME THING THAT THE STAR WOULD APPEAR TO US FROM THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX TO MOVE OVER THE ABOVE MENTIONED ARCH IN THE SAME TIME TO APPLY THIS TO ARCTURUS WE FIND BY CALCULATION THAT ITS DISTANCE FROM THE APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION IS 470 7 6 ITS PARALLACTIC MOTION THEREFORE WHICH IS AS THE SINE OF THAT DIS TANCE WILL BE 21O8718 AND THIS AS HAS BEEN SHOWN IS THE APPARENT MOTION WHICH OBSERVATION HAS ESTABLISHED AS THE PROPER MOTION OF ARCTURUS IN THE NEXT PLACE IF WE ADMIT SIRIUS TO BE A VERY LARGE STAR SITUATED AT THE DISTANCE 168O9 FROM US AND COMPUTE ITS ELON GATION FROM THE APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION WE SHALL FIND IT 38SO 145O5 WITH THESE TWO DATA WE CALCULATE THAT ITS PA RALLACTICMOTION WILL BE R  S 11128 AND THIS ALSO R DS AGREES WITH THE APPARENT MOTION WHICH HAS BEEN ASCERTAINED BY OBSERVATION AS THE PROPER MOTION OF SIRIUS NOW SINCE ACCORDING TO THE RULES OF PHILOSOPHISING WE OUGHT NOT TO ADMIT MORE MOTIONS THAN WILL ACCOUNT FOR THE OBSERVED CHANGES IN THE SITUATION OF THE STARS IT WOULD BE WRONG TO HAVE RECOURSE TO THE MOTIONS OF ARCTURUS AND SIRIUS WHEN THAT OF THE SUN ALONE WILL ACCOUNT FOR THEM BOTH AND THIS CONSIDERATION WOULD BE A SUFFICIENT INDUCEMENT FOR US TO146 DR HERSCHEL ON THE DIRECTION OF THE FIX AT ONCE ON THE CALCULATED APEX AS WELL AS ON THE RELATIVE DISTANCES THAT LEAVE BEEN ASSIGNED TO THESE STARS IF OTHER PROPER MOTIONS COULD WITH EQUAL FACILITY BE RESOLVED INTO SIMILAR PARAL LACTIC APPEARANCES BUT FROM THE NATURE OF PROPER MOTIONS IT FOLLOWS THAT WHEN A THIRD STAR DOES NOT LEAD US TO THE SAME APEX AS THE OTHER TWO ITS APPARENT MOTION CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX ALONE AND TO ENHANCE OUR DIFFICULTIES THE NUMBER OF APICES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SOLVE ALL PROPER MOTIONS INTO PARALLACTIC ONES INCREASES NOT AS THE NUMBER OF STARS ADMITTED TO HAVE PROPER MOTIONS BUT WHEN THEIR SITUA TION HAPPENS TO BE FAVOURABLE AS THE SUM OF AN ARITHMETICAL SERIES OF NATURAL NUMBERS BEGINNING AT O CONTINUED TO AS MANY TERMS AS THERE ARE STARS ADMITTED SO THAT IF TWO STARS GIVE ONLY ONE APEX ONE STAR ADDED TO IT WILL GIVE THREE APICES AND TEN FOR INSTANCE WILL GIVE NO LESS THAN 45 AND SO ON THE METHOD OF REASONING WHICH ON THIS SUBJECT I HAVE ADOPTED IS SO CLOSELY CONNECTED WITH ASTRONOMICAL OBSERVATIONS THAT I SHALL KEEP THEM CONSTANTLY IN VIEW AND THEREFORE SHALL ILLUSTRATE WHAT HAS BEEN ADVANCED BY TAKING IN CAPELLA AS A THIRD STAR THE THREE APICES WHICH THEN ARE POINTED OUT WILL BE THAT IN THE MOUTH OF THE DRAGON BY ARCTURUS AND SIRIUS A SECOND UND R THE NORTHERN WING OF CYGNUS BY ARCTURUS AND CAPELLA AND A THIRD IN THE FOLLOWING HAND OF HERCULES BY SIRIUS AND CAPELLA THE CALCULATION OF THEM IS IN TABLE I THE ANNUAL PROPER MOTIONS OF OUR THIRD STAR IN DR MASKE LYNES TABLES ARE  O2 1 IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND  O44 IN NORTH POLAR DISTANCE AND BY CALCULATION THESE QUANTITIES GIVE AN ANNUAL MOTION OF O46374 TO CAPELLA IN A DIRECTION WHICH MAKES AN ANGLE OF 710 35S 224 SOUTHFOLLOWING WITH THE PARALLEL OF THIS STARMOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM 47 THEDISTANCE OF CAPELLA FROM THE SAME CALCULATED APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION BY WHICH WE HAVE ALREADY EXPLAINED THE APPARENT MOTIONS OF THE OTHER TWO STARS IS 80 AIM4 46 AND ADMITTING IAGAIN THE VELOCITY OF THE SUN TOWARDS THE SAME POINT AS STATED BEFORE IT WILL OCCASION A PARALLACTIC MOTION OF CAPELLA IN A DIRECTION 89 54 48 SOUTHFOLLOWING ITS PARALLEL AMOUNT ING TO 8125 IN THIS CALCULATION CAPELLA HAS BEEN TAKEN FOR A STAR OF THE FIRST MAGNITUDE SUPPOSING ITS DISTANCE FROM US TO BE EQUAL TO THAT OF ARCTURUS BY CONSTRUCTING THEN A TRIANGLE THE THREE SIDES OF WHICH WILL REPRESENT THE THREE MOTIONS WHICH EVERY STAR MUST HAVE THAT IS NOT AT REST IN SPACE WRE HAVE ONE OF THE SIDES REPRESENTING THE APPARENT MOTION OF THE STAR EQUAL TO O4637 I THE OTHER SIDE BEING THE PARALLACTIC MOTION OF THE STAR 28125  AND THE INCLUDED ANGLE 18 19 27 FROM THESE DATA WE OBTAIN THE THIRD SIDE REPRESENTING THE REAL MOTION OF THE STAR WHICH WILL BE 23757 BY THE GIVEN SITUATION OF THIS TRIANGLE WITH RESPECT TO THE PARALLEL OF DECLINATION OF CAPELLA THE ANGLE OF THE REAL MOTION WILL ALSO BE HAD WHICH IS 860 1 1 NORTHFOLLOWING THE PARALLEL OF THIS STAR A COMPOSITION OF THE PARALLACTIC AND THE REAL MOTION IN THE DIRECTIONS WE HAVE ASSIGNED WILL PRODUCE THE ANNUAL APPARENT MOTION WHICH HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED BY OBSERVATION BUT TO APPLY WHAT HAS BEEN SAID TO OUR PRESENT PURPOSE IT MAY BE OBSERVED THAT ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THE PROPER MOTION OF OUR THIRD STAR BY RETAINING THE SAME APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION WHICH HAS GIVEN US AN EXPLANATION OF THE APPARENT MOTIONS OF THE OTHER TWO YET IN DOING THIS WE HAVE BEEN OBLIGED TO ASSIGN A GREAT DEGREE OF REAL MOTION TO CAPELLA AND TO THIS IT MAY BE OBJECTED THAT WE CAN HAVE NO AUTHORITYDR HERSCHEL ON THE DIRECTION OF THE TO DEPRIVE ARCTURUS AND SIRIUS OF REAL MOTIONS IN ORDER TO GIVE ONE OF THE SAME NATURE TO OUR THIRD STAR AND INDEED TO EVERY STAR THAT HAS A PROPER MOTION WHICH DOES NOT TEND TO THE SAME PARALLACTIC CENTER AS THE MOTIONS OF ARCTURUS AND SIRIUS THIS OBJECTION IS PERFECTLY WELL FOUNDED AND I HAVE GIVEN THE ABOVE CALCULATION ON PURPOSE TO SHOWV THAT WHEN WE ARE IN SEARCH OF AN APEX FOR THE SOLAR MOTION IT OUGHT TO BE SO FIXED UPON AS TO BE EQUALLY FAVOURABLE TO EVERY STAR WHICH IS PROPER FOR DIRECTING OUR CHOICE HENCE A PROBLEM WILL ARISE IN OUR PRESENT CASE HOW TO FIND A POINT WHOSE SITUATION AMONG THREE GIVEN APICES SHALL BE SO THAT IF THE SUNS MOTION BE DIRECTED TOWARDS IT THERE MAY BE TAKEN AWAY THE GREATEST QUANTITY OF PROPER MOTION POSSIBLE FROM THE GIVEN THREE STARS THE INTRI CACY OF THE PROBLEM IS GREATER THAN AT FIRST IT MAY APPEAR7 BECAUSE BY A CHANGE OF THE DISTANCE OF THE APEX FROM ANY ONE OF THE STARS ITS PARALLACTIC MOTION WHICH IS AS THE SINE OF THAT DISTANCE WILL BE AFFECTED SO THAT IT IS NOT THE MERE ALTERATION OF THE ANGLE OF DIRECTION WHICH IS CONCERNED IHOWEVER IT WILL NOT BE NECESSARY TO ENTER INTO A SOLUTION OF THE PROBLEM FOR IT MUST BE VERY EVIDENT THAT A MUCH MORE COMPLEX ONE WOULD IMMEDIATELYSUCCEED IT SINCE THREE STARS WOULD CER TAINLY NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO DIRECT US IN OUR PRESENT ENDEAVOUR TO FIND THE BEST SITUATION OF AN APEX FOR THE SOLAR MOTION I SHALL THEREFORE NOW LEAVE THESE STARS AND THE APICES POINTED OUT BY THEM IN ORDER TO PROCEED TO A MORE GENERAL VIEW OF THE SUBJECT WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THAT THE BRIGHTEST STARS ARE MOST PROPER FOR SHOWING THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX AND THAT IN OUR SEARCH AFTER THE DIRECTION OF THE SOLAR MOTION OUR AIM MUST BE TO REDUCE THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE STARS TO THEIR LOWESTMOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM QUANTITIES THE SIX PRINCIPAL STARS WHOSE INTERSECTING ARCHES HAVE BEEN GIVEN WHEN THEIR PROPER MOTIONS IN RIGHT ASCENSION AND POLAR DISTANCE ARE BROUGHT INTO ONE DIRECTION WILL HAVE THE APPARENT MOTIONS CONTAINED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE TABLE ILE NAMES OF THE

WHAT HAS BEEN SAID WHEN THE CON STRUCTION OF THE TRIANGLE EXPRESSING THE THREE MOTIONS OF A STAR THAT IS NOT AT REST WAS EXPLAINED AND AS WE ARE TO FIND OUT A SOLAR MOTION WHICH WILL REQUIRE THE LEAST REAL MOTION IN OUR SIX STARS AN ATTENTION TO THIS TRIANGLE WILL BE OF CONSIDERABLE USE FOR WHEN THE LINE P A FIG 1 WHICH REPRESENTS THE REAL MOTION IS BROUGHT INTO THE SITUATION M A WHERE IT IS PERPENDI CULAR TO SP THE REAL MOTION WHICH IS REQUIRED WILL THEN BE A MINIMUM IT ALSO FOLLOWS FROM THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SAME TRIANGLE THAT IF BY THE CHOICE OF AN APEX FOR THE SOLAR MOTION WE CAN LESSEN THE ANGLE MADE AT S BY THE LINES SP AND SA WE SHALL LESSEN THE QUANTITY OF REAL MOTION REQUIRED TO BRING THE STAR FROM THE PARALLACTIC LINE STPM TO THE OBSERVED POSITION A IT HAS ALREADY BEEN SHOWN IN THE CASE OF SIRIUS AND ARCTURUS MDCCCV K KA50 LDR HERSCHEL ON THE DIRECTION OF THE THAT WHEN TWO STARS ONLY ARE GIVEN THE LINE SP MAY BE MADE TO COINCIDE WITH THE LINES SA OF BOTH THE STARS WHEREBY THEIR REAL MOTIONS WVILL BE REDUCED TO NOTHING IT HAS ALSO BEEN PROVED BY ADDING CAPELLA TO THE FORMER TWO THAT WHEN THREE STARS ARE CONCERNED SOME REAL MOTION MUST BE ADMITTED IN ONE OF THEM NOXV SINCE ALL PARALLACTIC MOTIONS ARE DIRECTED TO THE SAME CENTER A SINGLE LINE MAY REPRESENT THE DIRECTION OF THE EFFECT OF THE PARALLAX NOT ONLY OF THESE THREE STARS BUT OF EVERY STAR IN THE HEAVENS ACCORDING TO THIS THEORY LET THE LINE S P OR S S IN FIG 2 STAND FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE PARAL LACTIC MOTION OF THE STARS AND AS IN THE FOREGOING TABLE WEE HAVE THE ANGLES OF THE APPARENT MOTION OF SIX STARS WITH THE PARALLEL OF EACH STAR WE MUST NOW ALSO COMPUTE THE DIRECTION OF THE LINE SP OR SS WITH THE PARALLELS OF THE SAME STARS THIS MAY BE DONE AS SOON AS AN APEX FOR THE SOLAR MOTION IS FIXED UPON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE ANGLES AND THE FORMER WILL GIVE THE SEVERAL PARALLACTIC ANGLES PSA OR SSA REQUIRED FOR AN INVESTIGATION OF THE LEAST QUANTITY MA BELONGING TO EVERY STAR FOR INSTANCE LET THE POINT TOWARDS WHICH WE MAY SUPPOSE THE SUN TO MOVE BE A HERCULIS AND CALCULATING THE REQUIRED ANGLES OF THE DIRECTION IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF PARALLAX WILL BE EXERTED WITH THE SIX STARS WE HAVE SELECTED FOR THE PURPOSE OF ONR INVESTIGATION WE FIND THEM AS IN THE FOLLOWING TABLEMOTION OF TH SN ANDSOLAR SO YSTEMO TABLE ILL ANGLES OF THE PARALLACTZIC MOTION WITH THE PARALLEL

ACCURACY SUCH OBSERVATIONS WE HAVE NOW BEFORE US IN THE VALUABLE TABLES FROM WHICH I HAVE TAKEN THE PROPER MOTIONS OF THE SIX STARS AND I SHALL PROVE THAT WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE WE MAY FIX ON A SOLAR MOTION THAT WILL BE CONSIDERABLY MORE FAVOURABLE WE HAVE ALREADY SHOWN THAT TO ASCERTAIN THE PRECISE PLACE OF THE BEST APEX IS ATTENDED WITH SOME DIFFICULTY BUT FROM THE INSPECTION OF THE FIGURE WHICH REPRESENTS THE QUANTITIES OF REAL MOTION REQUIRED WHEN A HERCULIS IS FIXED UPON IT WILL BE SEEN THAT BY A REGULAR METHOD OF APPROXIMATION WE MAY TURN THE LINE SP INTO A SITUATION WHERE ALL THE ANGLES OF THE  SEE PHIL TRANS FOR 1783 P 273 LINLE 8 AND PAGE 274 LINE 4MOTION OF THE SUN AND SOLAR SYSTEM APPARENT MOTION OF THE SIX STARS WILL BE MUCH REDUCED THE QUANTITIES WHICH ARE REQUIRED FOR CONSTRUCTING ANOTHER FIGURE TO REPRESENT THE THREEFOLD MOTIONS OF OUR SIX STARS WHEN A DIFFERENT APEX IS FIXED UPON ARE TO BE FOUND BY THE SAME METHOD WE HAVE PURSUED IN THE INSTANCE OF X HERCULIS AND THE FIGURE THAT HAS BEEN GIVEN WITH RESPECT TO THAT STAR SHOWS EVIDENTLY THAT THE PARALLACTIC LINE SP SHOULD BE TURNED MORE TOWARDS THE LINE S A REPRESENTING THE APPARENT MOTION OF SIRIUS WE SHALL

DIRECTION OF THE WITH ITS APPARENT MOTION WE MAY SOON OBTAIN A CERTAIN MINIS MUM OF THE OTHER PARALLACTIC MOTIONS BUT AS SIRIUS IS NOT THE STAR WHICH HAS THE GREATEST PROPER MOTION IT OCCURRED TO ME THAT ANOTHER MINIMUM OBTAINED FROM THE LINE IN WHICH ARCTURUS APPEARS TO MOVE WOULD BE MORE ACCURATE FOR ON ACCOUNT OF ITS GREAT PROPER MOTION WE HAVE REASON TO SUPPOSE IT MORE AFFECTED THAN OTHER STARS BY THE PARALLAX ARISING FROM THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND WITH A VIEW TO THIS I SOON WAS LED TO A POINT NOT ONLY IN THE LINE OF THE APPARENT MOTION OF ARCTURUS BUT EQUALLY FAVOURABLE TO SIRIUS AND PROCYON THE REMAINING TWO STARS THAT HAVE THE GREATEST MOTIONS IF THE PRINCIPLE OF DETERMINING THE DIRECTION OF THE SOLAR MOTION BY THE STARS WHICH HAVE THE GREATEST PROPER MOTION BE ADMITTED THE

WITH THE APEX OF THE SOLAR MOTION ABOVE MENTIONED IS LESS IN THIS TABLE THAN THAT IN THE FORMER BY O55O34 IN THESE CALCULATIONS WE HAVE PROCEEDED UPON THE PRINCIPLE OF OBTAINING THE LEAST POSSIBLE QUANTITY OF REAL MOTION BY WAY OF COMING AT THE MOST FAVOURABLE SITUATION OF A SOLAR APEX AND HAVE PROVED THAT THE SUM OF THE OBSERVED PROPER MOTIONS OF TH E SIX PRINCIPAL STARS AMOUNTING TO TS54 MAY BE THE RESULT OF A COMPOSITION OF TWO OTHER MOTIONS AND THAT THE REAL MOTIONS OF THESE STARS IF THEY COULD BE REDUCED TO THEIR SMALLEST POSSIBLE QUANTITIES WOULD NOT EXCEED OT4FG  BUT AS I DO NOT INTEND TO ASSERT THAT THESE REAL MOTIONS CAN BE ACTUALLY BROUGHT DOWN TO THE LOW QUANTITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IT WILL BE NECESSARY TO SHOW THAT THE VALIDITY OF THE ARGUMENTS FOR ESTABLISHING THE METHOD I HAVE PURSUED WILL NOT BE AFFECTED BY THAT CIRCUMSTANCE IN THE FIRST PLACE THEN WE SHOULD CONSIDER THAT ALTHOUGH THE GREAT PROPER MOTIONS OF ARCTURUS PROCYON AND SIRIUS ARE STRONG INDICATIONS OF THEIR BEING AFFECTED BY PARALLAX IT DOES NOT FOLLOW NOR IS IT PROBABLE THAT THE APPARENT CHANGES OF THE SITUATION OF THESE STARS SHOULD BE INTIRELY OWING TO SOLAR MOTION ON THE CONTRARY WE MAY REASONABLY EXPECT THAT THEIR IOWN REAL MOTIONS WILL HAVE A GREAT SHARE IN THEM NEXT TO THIS IT IS EVIDENT THAT IN THE CASE OF PARALLACTIC MOTIONS THE DISTANCE OF A STAR FROM THE SUN IS OF MATERIAL CONSEQUENCE  AND AS THIS CANNOT BE ASSUMED AT PLEA SURE WE ARE CONSEQUENTLY NOT AT LIBERTY TO MAKE THE PARALLACTIC MOTION SP IN FIG T EQUAL TO THE LINE SM OF THE SAME FIGURE  HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE REAL MOTION OF THE STAR CANNOT BE FROM M TO A AS THE FOREGOING CALCULATIONS HAVE SUPPOSED BUT WILL BE FROM P TO A IT IS HOWEVER VERY EVIDENT THAT IF M A BEEGB DR IERSCHIEL ON THE DIRECTION OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN C A MINIMUM THE LINE PA WHEN SP IS GIVEN XVILL ALSO BE A MI NIMUM AND IF ALL THE MAS IN FIG 4 ARE MINIMA IT FOLLOWS ALSO THAT ALL THE SPS WHATEVER THEY MAY BE WILL GIVE THE PAS AS SMALL AS POSSIBLE AND THIS IS THE POINT THAT WAS TO BE ESTABLISHED WHATEVER THEREFORE MAY BE THE SUM OF REAL MOTIONS REQUIRED TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PHENOMENA OF PROPER MOTIONS OUR FOREGOING ARGUMENTS CANNOT BE AFFECTED BY THE RESULT FOR AS BY OBSERVA TION IT IS KNOWN THAT PROPER MOTIONS DO EXIST AND SINCE NO SOLAR MOTION CAN RESOLVE THEM INTIRELY INTO PARALLACTIC ONES WE OUGHT TO GIVE THE PREFERENCE TO THAT DIRECTION OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN WHICH WILL TAKE AWAY MORE REAL MOTION THAN ANY OTHER AND THIS AS WE HAVE SHOWN WILL BE DONE WHEN THE RIGHT ASCENSION OF THE APEX IS 2450 52 30 AND

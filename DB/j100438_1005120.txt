different accidents cquially refult from falls or blows received oni the hwead and previous to this diftindlion it was eafy to con found them a miftake highly prejudicial to the patient who is affeded with concuflion only as it requires a different treatment from effufion and is not relieved by the trepan When there is a colledtion of blood from a blow or fraEure of the fcull all autlhors advife thie trepan in order to difclharge the coliedted fluiid but the difficulty of afcer tainig tlle part where it has accumnulated often makes frequent repetitions of the operation necefary before it is

communicate to the fociety fome ideas whrhich have occurred to me and by which I have been fo happy as to fricceed in a cafe I hiad an oppomrnity of attending in the Frenich hiofppital eflablihed in Phiila delphia In cafes of acctumtulated blood bctwncn the fcull anld dura mater thie adhelion which unites them is deIlroyed in the place occupied lby the fluitd the colleded matter is circumfcribed in a larger or fImaller fpace it expands the du ra mater and forminiig a tumor thiat oppreffes the brain pro duces the effe6s which require the operation of the trepan In this cafe a fingle opening made in the fcull on one of the points of effufion is fufficient to give vent to the fluid becaufe the blood preiTed on all fides by the afdion of the brain quits the place it had colleed in and flows towards the part that offers a paffagc It happens in this cafe as it does in that where the accmlulaticn exiffs be tween the lura and pia mater that the blood equally prcfld by the brain runs between tlhofe two mlembranes flows towards the opening by the trepan and preffes the dulra mater outward which indicates to the operator that this membrane requires incifion in order to give paffige to the colledled fluid It is onlyr in the firft cafe tlat the adhefion of the dura mater to the cranium by retaining the fluid requires a xepetition of the opening ihould the operator not meet at firfl with the precife fpot where the fluid Is colleded To avoid thefe inconveniences I propofe in fuch a cafe to deflroy the adhefion wvhich unites the Itra imater to the fcull and effabliih a communication between the colleded blood and the opening already made by the trepan by this means a repetition of trepanning would be avoided and the operation becotving mnore eafy might fave the life of the patient in any cafe not neceffarily mortal which isUNDER TrHE SCULL 435 is particularly interefling when the effuLfion is fituated at the bottom of the fcull If inflead of trepanning twelve times Mr Marefchal had feparated the duLra mater from the cranium following the diredtioni of thle fradure he would have certainly reached the effufiotn and the blood would have been eva cuated by the firft opening although it mutft have rifen aainit its own weight this will be eafily underftood by phyfiologifIs who advert to the force of preffure the brain exercifes on every part of the fcull and compare it with the refiftance the colleded blood may oppofe by its fpecific weight Tnhe danger arifing from a feparation of the dura inater mnay perhaps be confidered as forbidding the method I re commnend but experience flhews this feparation is not dan gerous fince as I have already faid blood cannot colled between thefe two parts witlhout feparation and yet they re turn to their natural ftate when the fluid is evacuated by the trepan even where the feparated parts have long re mained divided from each other by the interpofition of the fluid Of the cafes which fupport my opinion it will be fuiffi cient to mention the following A young perfon after the fcarlet fever had a violent pain which fixed itfelf at the upper part of the head every tlhing art could indicate was tried to effed a cure bleeding bathing cathartics internal remedies topicals of every kind and blifers on the affedced part all lhad failed mwhen I was confulted I advifed the moxa wlhich was applied to the difeafed part and though a plentiful fuppuration followecd the pain feemed to increafe and for fix months continued to augmient when I was again requefted to give my advice I prefcribed the trepan which operation was immediately performed in the centre of the painful part the opening made in the fcull by this 2 L 3 means436 ON E FF USION nmeans gave vent to a quantity of ptus of a greenifh white colour the pain ceafed entirely the patient was foon cur ed and fince ha enjoyed a perfed flate of health The preceding obfervation clearly fhews the dura mater had been long feparated froma the fcull by the matter and proves that the feparation of tllis membrane is not dan gerous It will be faid perhiaps that this feparation did not pro duce any bad effedt becaufe it took place graduially my anfver is an effufion occafioned by violent blows is fud denly formed it forces the dura mater from the cranium witlh violence and feparates it fometiines to a great extent It may be again objeaed that nature though acting haftily manages in a manner art cannot imitate in fcparating the dura mater from the fcull I will oppofe this objeaion Iy experience and not argument The 29th of Mqarclh 1795 there was brought to the French hofpital eflablifhed in this city a mani about thirty eight years of age of a middle fize and very robuft con flitution he was comatofe his face inflated and difco loured with ecchymofis his body covered with bruifes and mnany wounds made with pointed infIruments thofe who brought him told me he hkad been ltruck with an iron bar which fraalcured his fcull and had been trepan iied on the fpot After uncovering the head it was wafhed and fhaved and I found the trepan had been applied on the upper part of the right parietal bone about an inch from the coronal fLiture I took away with the lenticular knife pieces of the internal plate which wounded the dura mater and enlarged the wounds in the direation of the fraaure on which the trepan lhad been applied it proceeded from the fagittal fui ture and defcended almoft in a right line into the temporal region at the upper part of which 1 bounded my incifion althoughU N D E R T I E SC UL L 437 although the fradure extended lower I obferved another fradture in the upper and lower part of the fame parietal wvhich hlad feparated a piece of the bone about three inches long and two wide this piece was neitlher incdetited nor dilfplaced was belhind and a little above the part trepanned blood iffued froin the filperior anid pofterior fradures The next inorning the patient wras in the fame tate in fenfibly voided his urinie and could not fwNallow The dreffing was removed much blood came from the opening by the trepan and from the frailures When I vifited him in the evening he was comatofe but little blood came from the wound nor did the preffure I made on the dura mater produce more I introduced a blunt flexilbe probe under the fcull in the diredlion of the fradture from whence the blood proceeded in the laft dreff ing and cndeavoured to do the fame by the fradure which defcended to the temnporal region at the diftlance of about a quarter of an inch was ftopped by a fudden refiftance anid it was at that moment refledtion fuggefted the method I imniiediately put in pradtice I prefumed the comnatofe drowfinefs which continued was occafioned by colleded blood and that it exifted under one of the points of the fradure in the temporal region be caufe thofe effulifons which had bcen formed under the otlher fra6tures wsere evacuated in the preceding dreffing Had I followed the ufual metlhod it is poffible I might have miiade many openinigs befole I had fucceeded or have failed finding it confequently after the refledion which fuggefted that the adlhefion between the fcull and the dura rnater might be feparated without inconveniience I deter mnined to feparate the miienmbrane by followiing the diredtion of the fradlure and proceeded to this operation with a fil ver fpatuLla very flexible the extremiiities of wvhich were rounded I took the precaution to prefs it towards the bone and to bend mv iiftrumiient by degrees as 1 enitered to make it83X ON EFFIUSION it take the form of the part upon which I aated and often Irew it back to imeaftire on the outfide the A ay it had made At lengtlh after having entered half an inch below the tem pcIral fcaly future the refiftance fuddenly ceafed and mi y inflrumcntt entered a hollow part at the fhme moment the blood flowved in grreat abundance wlhen it ceafed I drew otut the fpatula wlhich wvas followed by a finall quantity The patient then began to move ftrongiy tried to rife and tallcd witlhout knowingr what he faid Ille next morniing I founid him tied in his bed this method was neceffary becaufe he endeavoured to rife as as he faid to go and fight More blood came away at the drefling In the afternoon I found him better he drank plentifully and anfwered my queftions the next morning being the fourth after the accident he had perfeWly reco vered his fenfes and from that time continued to mend As his head had been muich wounded many abfceffes were formed on the exterior the laft was on the piece of thle pa rietal bone already fpoken of and as it had no connedioti and wvas vacilating I eafily tock it away the dura mnator recovered and followedc the motion of the brain the wound had fuppurated and the cicatrix was much advanced when the patient went out the 28tll of December Durilng the cuire the patient felt no pain in that palt of the head where I had feparated the dura mater the cure of this trepan was neither longer or more difficuLlt than ufual if we except the comnplication from the gatherings which are foreign to the fubje6t I cited Mr Marefclhals obfervation becaufe the cafe is fitmilar to that whiclh makes the fubje6t of this eflay Mr Marefchals patient had a fracture which croffed the pari etal and temporal bones mine had fradures in the fame bones and fame places there was alfo another and fome very ferious bruifes which made the difeafe complicated Mr Marefchal trepanned his patient twelve times I cur ed mine with one operation and by a method which to the beft of my knowledge had never before been tried DEVEZE

J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107849,EXPERIMENTS RELATIVE TO THE EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE REFRACTIVE INDEX AND DISPERSIVE POWER OF EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS AND ON THE INFLUENCE OF THESE CHANGES IN A TELESCOPE WITH A FLUID LENS,I206983, 313  XV EXPERIMENTS RELATIVE TO THE EJFECT OF TEMPERATURE ON THE REFRACTIVE INDEX AND DISPERSIVE POWER OF EXPANSIBLEFLUIDS AND ON THE INFLUENCE OF THESE CHANGES IN A TELESCOPE WITH AFLUID LENS BY PETER BARLOW ESQ FPRS SYC READ MAY 151828 IN A PAPER I HAD THE HONOUR TO PRESENT TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY IN JANUARY LAST RELATIVE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF ACHROMATIC TELESCOPES WITH FLUID LENSES I HAVE STATED THAT BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURES OF 310 AND 840 I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETECT ANY VERY SENSIBLE CHANGE IN THE INDEX DENOTING THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE TELESCOPE THESE OBSERVATIONS HOWEVER BEING MADE AT INTERVALS OF SOME MONTHS I WAS DOUBTFUL WHETHER THERE MIGHT NOT BE SOME MINUTE VARIATION WHICH HAD ESCAPED MY NOTICE AND I HAVE SINCE BY MEANS OF TEMPERATURE ARTIFICIALLY PRO DUCED ASCERTAINED THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN SMALL CHANGE AND THE AMOUNT OF THAT CHANGE WHICH IS RO4JOTHS OF AN INCH IN THE LENGTH OF THE TELESCOPE EMPLOYED BETWEEN EACH OF THESE EXTREMES AND THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF 57 THAT IS THE EYEPIECE OF THE TELESCOPE AND THE FLUID LENS BEING FIXED AS WAS THE CASE IN THIS INSTRUMENT THE PLATE LENS REQUIRED AN ADJUSTMENT OF 0134 OF AN INCH BETWEEN THE TEMPERATURE OF 570 AND EACH OF THE ABOVE EXTREMES TO PRODUCE THE BRIGHTEST AND MOST PERFECT IMAGE BEFORE I PROCEED HOWEVER TO DETAIL THE RESULTS OF MY INQUIRY ON THESE SUB JECTS IT WILL BE PROPER TO DEFINE A FEW TERMS WHICH APPEAR IN ONE OR TWO IN STANCES TO HAVE BEEN MISUNDERSTOOD 1 THE LENGTH OR FOCAL LENGTH OF THE TELESCOPE IS THE DISTANCE FROM THE FRONT LENS TO THE FOCUS 2 THE FLUID FOCUS OR FLUID FOCAL LENGTH IS THE DISTANCE FROM THE FLUID LENS TO THE FOCUS 3 THE FOCAL POWER OF THE TELESCOPE OR THE EQUIVALENT FOCAL LENGTH IS THE FOCAL LENGTH OF A TELESCOPE OF THE USUAL CONSTRUCTION WHICH GIVES THE SAME CONVERGENCY TO THE RAYS OR THE SAME SIZED IMAGE AS THE TELESCOPE IN QUESTION MDCCCXXVIII 2 S314 MR BARLOW ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS IN WHAT FOLLOWS I WILL DENOTE THE LENGTH OF THE TELESCOPE F THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE PLATE LENS F THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE FLUID LENS F  THE FLUID FOCAL LENGTH F THE EQUIVALENT FOCAL LENGTH D THE DISTANCE OF THE LENSES UNDER THE PARTICULAR FORM OF CONSTRUCTION TO WHICH WE ARE NOW REFERRING F AND F REMAIN FIXED OR CONSTANT BUT THE REST ARE VARIABLE UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE EFFECT WHICH TEMPERATURE PRODUCES IN THE VALUE OFF IF WE KNEW THE CHANGE IN THE VALUE OFF OR IN THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE FLUID UNDER DIFFERENT TEMPERATURES WE MIGHT PROCEED IMMEDIATELY TO COMPUTE ITS EFFECTS ON THE FOCAL POWER OF THE TELESCOPE BUT AS THIS MAY BE CONSIDERED DOUBTFUL I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT ON THE POWER OF THE TELESCOPE BY DIRECT OBSERVATIONS AND HAVE THENCE COMPUTED THE CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE FLUID IN ORDER TO DETERMINE THE CHANGE IN THE POSITION OF THE FRONT LENS DUE TO A CERTAIN RANGE OF THE THERMOMETER I PLACED THE TELESCOPE IN A SMALL ROOM ABOUT TWELVE FEET SQUARE IN MY GARDEN AND HAVING ADJUSTED IT VERY CAREFULLY TO A DIALPLATE OF A WATCH AT THE DISTANCE OF 150 FEET WHEN THE THERMOMETER WAS AT 400 I HAD A FIRE LIGHTED THE ROOM SHUT UP AND THE TEMPERATURE GRADUALLY RAISED TO 750 READJUSTING AND REGISTERING THE FOCUS FOR EVERY CHANGE OF 5 AS HOWEVER THE INTERMEDIATE CHANGES WERE VERY SMALL IT WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO STATE THAT BETWEEN THE TWO EXTREMES VIZ 400 AND 75 THE WHOLE CHANGE WAS 0177 OF AN INCH AND HENCE SUPPOSING THE CHANGE UNIFORM FOR EQUAL VARIATIONS OF TEMPERATURE WE FIND FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAN TEMPERATURE OF 570 AND EACH EXTREME BEFORE MENTIONED VIZ 310 AND 840 AN ALTERATION IN THE LENGTH OF THE TELESCOPE OF 134 OF AN INCH AS STATED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS PAPER IN THE INSTRUMENT ON WHICH THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE THE FOLLOWING ARE THE VALUES OF THE DIFFERENT QUANTITIES AT THE MEAN TEMPERATURE 570 VIZF 325  3265 F  405 1  5492 D  1442 FFT  728MR BARLOW ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS 315 AND SINCE BY THE OBSERVATIONS ABOVE REFERRED TO THE VALUE OF D VARIED 0134 OF AN INCH BETWEEN THE MEAN TEMPERATURE AND EACH OF THE EXTREMES WE HAVE IN ONE CASE D 14554 AND IN THE OTHER D  14286 WHENCE THE FOCAL POWER OF THE TELESCOPE WAS FF AT 310 F FD 7334 FF AT 840 FILL FD  7228 SO THAT THE INSTRUMENT BEING ADJUSTED AT THE MEAN TEMPERATURE 570 AND FITTED WITH A MICROMETER IT WILL REQUIRE A CORRECTION OF ABOUT MOTH PART OF THE ANGULAR MEASURE FOR EVERY CHANGE OF 10 IN THE THERMOMETER THAT IS A 60TH PART OF A SECOND FOR EVERY MINUTE IN THE ANGLE A QUANTITY TOO SMALL TO REQUIRE ANY NOTICE EXCEPT IN CASES OF EXTREME DELICACY IN ORDER TO FIND THE ACTUAL CHANGE IN THE FOCUS OF THE FLUID LENS WHICH RENDERED THE FOREGOING ADJUSTMENTS OF THE PLATE LENS NECESSARY WE HAVE 1 1 1 1 1 1 FD FI L OR FD FIR O IN THIS EXPRESSION J  405F D AT 310 17946 FDAT 570 18080 FDAT840 18214 AND SUBSTITUTING THESE VALUES SUCCESSIVELY FORFD IN THE ABOVE EXPRESSION WE FIND F AT 310  32222 FT AT 570  32650 F AT 840  33090 AND SINCE IT HAS BEEN SHOWN PHIL TRANS 1827 ART XV THAT F  DI FF SPERSIVE RATIO WE HAVE AT 310 DISPERSION 3067 570 DISPERSION  3075 840 DISPERSION 3084 A DIFFERENCE SUFFICIENTLY SMALL TO BAFFLE THE MOST ACUTE AND EXPERIENCED EYE THE CHANGE THEREFORE IN THE POWER AND COLOUR OF THE TELESCOPE IS SO SMALL AND THE CORRECTION DUE TO IT IN ANY CASE WHERE SUCH CORRECTION IS THOUGHT NECESSARY SO EASILY MADE THAT AN INSTRUMENT ON THIS CONSTRUCTION MAY I TRUST BE CON SIDERED JLUST AS APPLICABLE TO ALL THE NICE PURPOSES OF MODERN ASTRONOMY AS ONE OF THE USUAL REFRACTORS OF THE SAME POWER 2316 MIR BARLOW ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS THE VERY INCONSIDERABLE CHANGE IN THE FOCAL POWER OF THE TELESCOPE LED ME TO CONCLUDE IN THE EARLY PART OF MY EXPERIMENTS THAT NO OPTICAL CHANGE TOOK PLACE IN THE FLUID BETWEEN THE ABOVE LIMITS OR AT LEAST THAT THE CHANGE WAS EXTREMELY SMALL IT APPEARS HOWEVER FROM THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS AND INVESTIGATION THAT THE PERMANENCY OF THE TELESCOPIC EFFECT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE PECULIAR CONSTRUCTION OF THE INSTRUMENT AND THAT THE CHANGE IN THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF THE FLUID IS MUCH MORE CONSIDERABLE THAN I HAD IMAGINED FOR WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE FOCAL LENGTH OF THE FLUID LENS WAS AT 310  3222 AT 570  3265 AT 840  3303 AND SINCE THE FOCAL LENGTH IS CAETERIS PARIBUS INVERSELY AS THE INDEX AND THE INDEX AT 57 BEING 0634 WE FIND 3222  3265 0634  0642 3309 3265 0634 0626 HENCE THE MEAN INDEX OF THE SULPHURET OF CARBON IS AT 310  0642 AT 570  0634 AT 840  0625 THAT IS WITH A VARIATION OF TEMPERATURE OF 530 THE CHANGE OF INDEX AMOUNTS TO 017  IL7TH PART NEARLY OF THE WHOLE INDEX AT 57 WHICH SUPPOSING THE CHANGE TO BE UNIFORMLY PROPORTIONAL IN GREATER THER MOMETRICAL RANGES GIVES A CHANGE IN THE REFRACTIVE INDEX OF NEARLY LTH BETWEEN 320 AND 212 NOW IT HAS BEEN STATED ON THE RESULT OF EXPERIMENT DR URES CHEMICAL DICTIONARY THAT THE EXPANSION OF SULPHURET OF CARBON AMOUNTS TO TH BETWEEN THE ABOVE LIMITS WE HAVE THEREFORE STRONG REASONS TO CONCLUDE THAT IN THIS AND ALL OTHER EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS THE INDEX OF REFRACTION VARIES DIRECTLY AS THE DENSITY THE TRIFLING DIFFERENCE IN THE TWO RESULTS BEING ATTRIBUTABLE IN ALL PROBABILITY TO SLIGHT ERRORS OF OBSERVATION IN ONE OR OTHER OF THE TWO PROCESSES SO DIFFERENT FROM EACH OTHER FROM WHICH THESE RESULTS ARE DEDUCED WITH RESPECT TO THE DISPERSIVE RATIO IT IS PROBABLY THE SAME AT ALL TEMPE RATURES  FOR SUPPOSING 1  1  A 1  1  A 1  1  A TO BE THE RATIO OF THE SINES OF INCIDENCE AND REFRACTION OF THE EXTREME AND MEAN RAYS OF THE SPECTRUM AT ANY GIVEN TEMPERATURE THE DISPERSIVE POWER IS EXPRESSED BY A A AND AS WE HAVE SEEN THAT THE MEAN INDEX A VARIES AS THE DENSITY OF THE FLUID WEMR BARLOW ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF EXPANSIBLE FLUIDS 317 HAVE STRONG REASON TO SUPPOSE THAT A AND A VARY ALSO IN THE SAME PROPORTION AND IF SO THE DISPERSIVE POWER WILL OF COURSE REMAIN CONSTANT AND THIS DE DUCTION IS VERIFIED AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN JUDGE OF COLOUR IN THE TELESCOPE BY THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS WHICH CERTAINLY INDICATED NO PERCEPTIBLE CHANGE IN THE COLOUR OF THE IMAGE THIS HOWEVER IS A SUBJECT I INTEND TO EXAMINE MORE PARTICULARLY WHEN MY LARGE TELESCOPE IS COMPLETED IT MAY BE PROPER TO OBSERVE THAT THE FORM OF THE INSTRUMENT HERE EMPLOYED DIFFERS A LITTLE FROM THAT DESCRIBED IN MY FORMER PAPER IN THE LATTER THE PLATE LENS IS A FIXTURE AND THE ADJUSTMENT IS MADE BY A SLIGHT MOTION OF THE FLUID LENS IN THIS I CAN MOVE EITHER LENS AT PLEASURE AND I HAVE CHOSEN TO FIX THE FLUID AND TO ADJUST THE PLATE LENS MERELY FOR THE SAKE OF SIMPLIFYING THE INVESTIGATION

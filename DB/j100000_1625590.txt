aright ANTHROPOLOGY OF FRENCH POLYNESIA WE scarcely ever hear about the French possessions in Polynesia The tricolor in fact floats over a number of coral islets and pocket archipelagoes in the benign climes of the Pacific sea The most important spots are Tahiti and the Marquesas group The anthropology of these islands is dis cussed by Dr Gros of the French navy in the Bulletins of the Anthropological Society Paris of this year After giving a number of measurements he discusses several questions of general in terest Is the native population decreasing and why It is decreasing not very rapidly and owing mainly to mortality from epidemics which this brown race has little power to resist They are moreover great drunkards and this predisposes them to disease Are they capable of culture development Decidedly so thinks Dr Gros Before the arrival of the whites they had made steady and considerable progress and when given an opportunity readily acquire and use modern education The teacher is the per son needed in Polynesia Divorces are fre quent and social morality low Much of this is owing to the example and influence of Europeans The race is rapidly becom ing of mixed blood from crossing with for eigners of different nationalities who visit the islands THE LATE DR A H POST IT would be difficult to name any writer in this generation whose conception of the science of Ethnology was so profound and noble as that of thelate Dr A H Post of Bremen He understood that science in its broadest connotation and clearly recog nized in it that branch of learning which in 685 the not distant future will modify all others changing their direction and alter ing their contents He saw that ethnol ogy is bound completely to subvert the present popular Weltanschauung and substi tute for it another with scarcely any points of contact Posts especial field was that branch of Ethnology which deals with the ideas of rights and equities the treaties and duties of man to man in other words jurispru dence in its largest meaning On this he wrote a number of articles and treatises the most important being his  Grundriss der ethnologischen Jurisprudenz published but a few months before his death This is a work which combines extraordinary minuteness of detail with equally extraor dinary grasp of principles and sets forth the elements of Ethnology as a one might almost say the universal science through one of its branches Dr Posts friend and admirer Dr Th Achelis has just published an appreciative tribute to the departed thinker It sets forth briefly the aim and spirit of his work and should be taken to heart by all who have learned to know this great new growth of mans intelligence A H Post und die vergleichende Rechtswissenschaft Ham burg 1896 D G BRINTON UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA NOTES ON INORGANIC CHEMISTRY A PAPER was recently read before the Royal Society of New South Wales by Prof Liversidge of the University of Sydney on the amount of gold and silver in sea water Heretofore it has been considered that the amount of gold present is about four grains per ton The experiments of Prof Liver sidge show that for Australian waters this figure is too large the amount being from onehalf to one grain of gold per ton of sea water Even this would be in round num bers about 200 tons of gold per cubic mile NOVEMBER 6 1896686 SCIENCE and if the volume of the ocean be consid ered 300000000 cubic miles a total amount of gold in sea water of sixty billion tons Yet this amount is probably insignificant in comparison with the amount of gold disseminated in crystalline and sedimen tary rocks apart from gold in veins and other deposits Experiments seem to indi cate that sea water contains about the same amount of silver and gold PROF F P VENABLES work on  The De velopment of the Periodic Law has just ap peared from the press of the Chemical Pub lishing Company It is a book of over three hundred pages dealing exhaustively with subjects from the days of Dalton and Prout down to the present year and cov ering a phase of chemical history hitherto vacant ON October 1st appeared the initial num ber of a new periodical in chemical tech nology the Chemische Rundschau Zeitschrift fur die gesammte chemische Industrie It is a quarto of twentyfour pages to appear semi monthly at sixteen Marks per year Its editor is Dr Franz Peters assistant at the Technische Hochschule at Charlottenburg and it is published in Berlin The first num ber contains several pages of original mat ter a rather larger number devoted to ab stracts and quite full trade notes together with book reviews society proceedings and patent lists THEE idea suggested by Prof Ramsay in connection with his work on Helium that it is possible that all atoms of the same chemical element do not possess exactly the same weight and which was also suggested by Prof Crookes in connection with his work upon the rare earths is by no means new Before Stas entered upon his great work on atomic weights he raised the ques tion as to whether these weights were un changeable but after experiment decided it in the affirmative Stas Untersuchung N S VOL IV No 97 iiber

quantitative anomalies in the amount of carbon dioxid obtained and Butlerow pro posed as a most probable cause a variation in weight of the carbon atom Bull Soc Chim 39 258263 This question has also been discussed on theoretical grounds by Marignac Kremers and Cooke Prof Ram says promised experiments on the frac tional diffusion of oxygen and nitrogen through clay septa will be awaited with interest as a valuable contribution to the subject J L H SCIENTIFIC NOTES AND NEWS A BUILDING FOR THE SCIENTIFIC SOCIETIES OF NEW YORK MR CHARLES F Cox Treasurer of the New York Academy of Sciences has addressed a let ter to the editor of the Evening Post appealing to a man of wealth or a group of men to pro vide a suitable building for the societies com posing the Scientific Alliance of New York The counsel of the Alliance was last year in corporated under a charter which gives it power to receive gifts and bequests and to hold real estate for the benefit of the organizations which it represents The combined membership of these societies is now over 1000 Nearly all of them issue valuable publications sev eral of them own important libraries and growing collections of specimens and all are actively engaged in original research as well as the popular presentation of scientific topics The societies suffer from lack of a suitable building similar to that of Burlington House London but in New York this can only be pro vided by the enlightened liberality of private citizens The proposed building should be lo cated in the center of the city and should be large enough to contain a lecturehall having a seating capacity of not less than 1200 in which free popular lectures could be given frequently a library with shelfroom for not less 100000

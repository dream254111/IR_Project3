Auflage mit deutscher Ubersetzung Leipzig J C HINRICHS I909 PP 731  20 8 STRACK has published four treatises of the Mishna to serve as textbooks for those who wish to be initiated into the post biblical Jewish literature One of them has appeared in a third edition and two in second editions the best proof of their useful ness Strack not only gives help to the student by a very careful punctuation explanatory notes and a good glossary but also tries to present as correct a text as possible with the material acces sible to him which also includes some MSS Fully conscious that it is at present impossible to present a critical edition he tries to establish a text which is much nearer to the original than any other see especially his introduction to Schabbath Leipzig I890 p 7 In this he has certainly succeeded and his texts mean a considerable step forward One can only express the wish that his promise to continue these editions may be realized in the near future The second edition of his Aboda Zara is a marked ad vance upon the first Berlin I888 Not only has the text and especially its vocalization been carefully revised but the apparatus has also been increased by the addition of the vocalized Codex Kaufmann and the editio princeps of the Palestinian Talmud Among the texts utilized the Palestinian version prevails being represented by three important codices The Babylonian version on the other hand is only represented by the Venice edition and occasionally the Munich MS according to Rabbinowicz Here the material might easily have been increased by the addition of 143144 THj JEWISH QUARTRLY REVIEW Alfasi the oldest complete witness of this version Of course only the editio princeps Constantinople 1509 is available for critical purposes as all the later editions are interpolated see Rabbino wicz lnID plpT IV 45 lloinn nRDEn I h1rn  130I In addition the Berlin Library possesses an important old MS of this work Cat Steinschneider No 6 Alfasi proves for instance that the addition in I 3 p 9 note h   iPnwn nIP w 1 occurring in M with the variant 11 for ln1 is not characteristic of the Babylonian version since he did not have it It is interpolated from a Baraita as it is introduced I4a by sn Krauss MGWJ 1902 322 thinks that it was taken from Tosefta I 4 but there the wording is different In Alfasi also the addition to II I p II n c

to the text it is worth mentioning that all corrections introduced by R Josef Ashkenas of Safed see MGWJ 1898 42 ff after collation of numerous MSS are as far as I have compared them found in Stracks text all he throws out occur only in the apparatus certainly a splendid testi mony for Stracks accuracy and thoroughness Only one unimportSTRACKS ABODA ZARA MARX 145 ant variant is put in the apparatus I 8 II note a where Ashkenas once more agrees with Codex Kaufmann So the publication of Adenis Mn5W l5nD in the new Wilna edition of the Mishna does not add new material to our text I have only noted that in I 7 Maimonides is to be added to the authorities adduced for the reading nlwm D1 1 p Io note w Strack observes p 4 that B the Babylonian Talmud ed Venice often agrees with the common text of the Mishna editions which means that these editions were changed according to the printed text of the Baby lonian Talmud This took place in the earliest known editions subsequent to that of Naples So the edition Venice I546 folio has the addition p 9 note h and omits the words p Io note p the following leaf is missing in the copy at my disposal The same text is offered by the edition of Venice 1549 with Obadia Bertinoros commentary which contains in the copy belonging to the Library of the Jewish Theological Seminary in New York City all the 6 Sedarim not merely the last three which Stein schneider Cat Bodl and others believed were the only ones printed comp also Stracks Introduction to the Talmud 4th ed 77 This edition also contains the additions I 8 p II note y and II I ib note c etc It seems therefore that all the known Mishna editions with the exception of that of Naples are inter polated and thus useless for scientific purposes Strack has rightly neglected them It is curious that as far as we know the manu scripts containing the text of the Mishna without any commentary Codd Cambridge Kaufmann Parma represent the Palestinian version while those with Maimonides commentary seem to be independent of both the Palestinian and Babylonian version Whether they agree among themselves has not yet been investi gated The translation which Strack has added to the new edition will be a great help to the student but it is often too literal and unidiomatic and even lacks clearness I quote two examples p 2 1 59 Strack translates Der Tag an dem ervom Meere heimgekehrt istnur dieser Tag und dieser Mann ist verboten instead of An dem Tage an dem jemand von einer Seereise heimgekehrt ist und nur an diesem Tage und mit diesem Manne ist es verboten Geschafte abzuschliessen P 3 1 I is uninI46 THEI JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW telligible as it reads at present To bestimmt Angegebenes the addition that it is meant for idolatrous purposes is indispensable The change from plural to singular p r 1 6 though occurring in the text ought to have been avoided In the notes appended to the translation special attention is paid to parallels from classical literature which are very instructive Of course here and there one must disagree with Strack Thus p I note 2 NW refers to borrowing of things which are returned as received nl6 to money or such things the value of which is to be returned P 2 note I5 Practical decisions are not mentioned as a basis for discussions but as the strongest and unmistakable proof for the opinion of its authors comp 1 Wtn B b I3ob The glossary which also has been carefully revised is very useful It is peculiar that it contains an article 5eigentl W since the editor rightly though against most of his authorities in this new edition has always connected it with the following word 2v V is rendered in the glossary jemdn bitten lassen while in the transla tion he has leihen Such little inaccuracies will easily be avoided in a later edition The little book can be warmly recommended and will undoubtedly prove a great help to the student Strack has once more earned the gratitude of all those who are inter ested in a scientific study of postbiblical Jewish literature Strack has speedily fulfilled his promise to continue his ex cellent editions of parts of the Mishna which he gave in his Aboda Zara There have just appeared two more treatises SanhedrinMakkoth Die Mischnatraktate iiber Strafrecht und Gerichtsverfahren nach Handschriften und alten Drucken Heraugegeben ubersetzt und erliutert von Prof D Dr HERMANN L STRACK Leipzig J C HINRICHS I9IO pp 60  56 8 The editor follows the same method and principles as in his Aboda Zara and the same general remarks apply to this new work The apparatus has been increased by the readings of the famous De Rossi MS 138 which shows a close affinity with the Cambridge MS edited by Lowe and the Kaufmann MS and hardly offers any new and striking differences as it does in some other treatises The Palestinian version therefore is represented in the apparatus even stronger than in Aboda Zara Strack in theSTRACK S ABODA ZARAMARX 147 introduction expresses his doubts whether the Cambridge MS actually represents the Palestinian recension of the Mishna a doubt that was first uttered in 1887 by J H Weiss in hTDKl IV p 22530 However the three manuscripts are undoubtedly very closely connected with the Mishna text of the Palestinian Talmud and they all form one family A glance at the variants put together in Krauss description of the Kaufmann manuscript MGWJ I902 proves this point The Babylonian version is again systematically represented only by the Venice edition of this Talmud the Munich MS being quoted only occasionally accord ing to the Variae Lectiones of Rabbinowicz In this respect the new edition of Sanhedrin by Krauss The Mishlta treatise Sanhedrin edited with an introduction notes and glossary Leiden I909 pp XIII  6I 8 offers much more recording all the im portant variants collected by Rabbinowicz But Krauss includes in his apparatus readings of texts which are without any critical value like the later editions of the Palestinian Talmud their disagreement between one another has as little interest for the construction of the text as the readings of the Wilna edition where in the margin Rabbinowicz also has been excerpted Stracks principle of an eclectic use of the different texts also recommends itself more than the reprint of the editio princeps given by Krauss Altogether the question which is the editio princeps of the Mishna is not quite settled as yet The Seminary Library has recently acquired 8 leaves forming the thirteenth quire of a Mishna edition in square characters without any commentary in octavo which seems to me to have been printed before the edition of I492 The leaves contain the end of Baba batra and almost the whole of Sanhedrin and offer a good many very interesting readings not found in the apparatus of Stracks and Krauss editions I will describe this fragment elsewhere For a second edition this fragment as well as the editio princeps of the Talmud Barco 1496 found if I am not mistaken in Munich and of Alfasi ought to be utilized as well as the variants of Rabbinowicz which for Makkot are also easily accessible in Friedmanns edition The oldest known variants those recorded in the Talmud as for VI 5 the remark of the Palestinian Talmud IM Ip 41n l n n1 I p Pln lP also belong into the apparatus148 THIE JEWISH QLUARTERLY REVIEW In the list of authorities p 67 those recorded among

contents but also by the form comp VII 4pL2PDn In 1 I IX I  trn pn in Il Nlnnn in liI XI tprlmn In 1l with Makkot II I in 15 tlin and III I Ip1in n 15K Mak I iob Yl nZ n pIl n iYS ilrn1 according to

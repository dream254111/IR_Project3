1908 RUSSIAN RESEARCH IN METABOLISM THE activity of Russian investigators in problems of animal nutrition and metabolism in general has been but imperfectly noted by the large majority of workers in metabolism This is in large part due to the fact that in spite of increasing interest in international cooperation in scientific research in all branches the Russian language remains and probably will continue to remain a distinctly unintelligible vehicle for conveying scientific communications to the world at large More recently at least one Russian journal is is suing simultaneously an edition in French Recognizing the great importance of many of the earlier Russian researches the Office of Experiment Stations of the U S Department of Agriculture has from time to time had translated and published abstracts of much of the Russian research in that particular branch of science dealing with metabolism These abstracts were translated in large part by Professor Peter Fireman formerly of the George Washington University and the ad mirable digest of metabolism experiments by Atwater and Langworthy1 contains many of them A dissertation entitled Production of Heat by Healthy Man in the Condition of Comparative Rest by A Likhachev is espe cially valuable as giving a complete descrip tion and tests of the Pashutin respiration calorimeter This was translated at the in stance of the Office of Experiment Stations U S Department of Agriculture by Dr Fireman Copies of the translation are on file at the Nutrition Laboratory and also at the Office of Experiment Stations U S De partment of Agriculture In connection with the preparation for pub Bulletin 45 Office of Experiment Stations U S Department of Agriculture 1898 lication of the results of a series of experi ments on fasting men made at Wesleyan Unni versity I arranged with a young Russian school teacher H Levin to translate com pletely a lengthy article entitled  Mletabo lism during Fasting by A Sadovyen This article is of interest in that it describes a series of experiments on a fasting man in the Pashutin respiration chamber The trans lation is preserved in the reading room of this laboratory On a recent visit to a number of European laboratories it was my good fortune to include several of the laboratories in St Petersburg and there I came into intimate contact with a great deal of research which was to me wholly unknown I found that in certain instances the briefest kind of an abstract had been noted in some of the German abstract journals but nothing approximating an adequate digest of this work had appeared as yet in anything but Russian Thanks to the kindness of Pro fessors Likhachev and Avroroff and Dr Kar taschefsky many important monographs were placed in my hands and on my return to America arrangements were made for their translation Professor Likhachev sent to the Nutrition Laboratory a copy of Pashutins treatise on experimental pathology This large work consisting of two bulky volumes contains a great deal of new unpublished material par ticularly in the section some 800 pages dealing with inanition During the past year the whole section on inanition has been com pletely translated by Michel Groosenberg This valuable work contains a large amount of original material chiefly from Albitskys laboratory and is of importance to all work ers in animal or human nutrition The trans lation has been typewritten manifolded and bound and copies of this translation are de posited in the surgeon generals library in Washington the New York Public Library and in the John Crerar Library in Chicago Two other monographs presenting the results of experiments on man in the Pashutin res piration calorimeter are The Influence of Alcohol on the Heat and Gas Exchange in 394 SCIENCEMARCH 5 1909 SCIENCE iMan and Investigations of Gas and Heat ixchange in Fevers both by A Likhachev nd P Avroroff Finally two articles by Dr 3jartaschefsky reporting experiments with the sinall Pashutin respiration apparatus have blen translated They are entitled The In fluence of a Lack of Oxygen on the Exchange of Matter and the Heat Production in Ami mrals and On the Influence of the Sur rounding Temperature upon Animals in a GasAtmosphere poor in Oxygen These articles were translated in part by Mr Alexander Rose of Boston Mr Michel Groosenberg and Miss Anna Monossowitch who is at present engaged in Russian trans lation at the Nutrition Laboratory Thus it is hoped to keep American workers in nutrition in more intimate contact with the admirable Russian researches that have as yet been practically inaccessible Arrangements have been made with Professor Likhachev whereby all articles dealing with problems of metabolism can be sent to this laboratory for translation From time to time the titles and short abstracts of these articles will be pub lished in some scientific journal FRANCIS G BENEDICT NUTRITION LABORATORY CARNEGIE INSTVITUTION OF WASHINGTON VILA STREET BOSTON MASS SPECIAL ARTICLES A MENDELIAN VIEW OF SEXHEREDITY Two important contributions have recently been made to the discussion of sexinherit ance In each a somewhat different view is presented yet the two I believe are not irrec oncilable and if coordinated will give us a truer conception of the whole matter than we have had before I refer on the one hand to the recent vicepresidential address of Pro fessor Wilson1 and on the other to the com bined work of Bateson Punnett Doncaster Durham and Marryat published in Report IV to the Evolution Committee of the Royal Society In 19032 I advocated the view that sex is in 1SCIENCE January 8 1909 2Bulletin Mus Cor Zool Vol 40 p 189 herited as a Mendelian character The idea was not original with me The suggestion came from the now famous Report I of Bate son and Saunders The fact has since come to light through Mendels posthumously pub lished letters that Mendel himself had been impressed by the parallelism between the phe nomena of sexinheritance and those of ordi nary Mendelian inheritance Indeed the parallelism is so complete and striking that we can scarcely question the existence of a like basis for the two sets of phenomena Professor Wilson to be sure argues against what he terms  Mendelian theories of sex heredity and advances a somewhat different theory of his own In reality however his theory while an improvement upon its prede cessors is no less Mendelian than they but rather more so as I shall attempt to show Great advance has been made since 1903 in our knowledge of Mendelian inheritance in general as well as of sexinheritance and it is noteworthy that in restating our knowledge in the two fields similar changes must be made in both For example we formerly said re garding crosses between rodents of different colors that gray is dominant over black and that black is dominant over yellow meaning that the contrasted characteristics were antagonistic and one excluded the other in crosses As we now look at the matter gray is not antagonistic to black but con tains an additional element which is wanting in black The correctness of this view is shown by the fact that black can be changed to gray by a cross which introduces that addi tional element A similar relation holds be tween black and yellow black is yellow plus something else and this something else may actually be added to yellow by a cross with brown for example converting it into black Similarly as regards sex in 1903 I expressed the view that male and female are antagon istic members of a Mendelian pair one ex cluding the other Such a view is inadmis sible in the light of our present knowledge What we should say is that the female is the male condition plus something else Male Abh mathphys Klasse d k Sachs Gesellsch d Wiss Bd 29 p 185

j100052,The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science,1010148,Political and Municipal Legislation in 1900,i242541,POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION IN I9001 During the period covered by this review October i 1899 to October  900oo thirteen states held regular2 and four held extra3 sessions Only six states have annual ses sions and all but eight of those having biennial sessions hold them in odd years5 so that there is only about half as much state legislation in even as in odd years The total number of acts and resolutions passed during this off year was 5886 of which Virginia passed 1485 New York 777 Maryland 758 Ohio 636 Massachusetts 594 New Jersey 201 South Carolina I8I and Kentucky 40 General vs Special LegislationIn the Annual Summary and Index of State Legislation issued by the New York State Library 1469 of these 5886 laws are summarized The Annual Summary includes all general laws and a few spe cial and temporary laws of general interest so that it is safe to say that threefourths of the laws passed were special Of the 1485 laws passed by Virginia only 152 or a little more than onetenth were general while in New Jersey over four fifths of the 20I laws passed were general The difference is doubtless due to the restrictions on special legislation con tained in the New Jersey constitution In Virginia the only restriction on special legislation is the provision that the legislature may not grant divorces change names direct the 1 For previous articles on  Political and Municipal Legislation  see ANNALS for May 1896 Vol VII pp

disability or grant relief in any other case where courts or other tribunals have jurisdiction1 Until I875 the New Jersey constitution merely prohibited the granting of divorces and the sale of land of persons under legal disability by special act but in that year an amendment was adopted restricting special leg islation within narrow limits2 This amendment provides that no general law shall embrace any provision of a special character that no special bill shall be passed unless public notice of intention to apply for it has been previously given and that special acts shall not be passed bearing on any of the following matters Laying out opening altering and working roads or highways Vacating any road townplot street alley or public grounds Regulating the internal affairs of towns and counties appointing local officers or commissions to regulate municipal affairs Selecting drawing summoning or empaneling grand or petit jurors Creating increasing or decreasing the percentage or allowance of public officers during the term for which said officers were elected or appointed Changing the law of descent Granting to any corporation association or individual any exclusive privilege immunity or franchise whatever Granting to any corporation association or individual the right to lay down railroad tracks Providing for changes of venue in civil or criminal cases Providing for the management and support of free public schools The legislature shall pass general laws providing for the cases enumerated in this paragraph and for all other cases which in its judgment may be provided for by general laws The legislature shall pass no special act conferring corporate powers but they shall pass general laws under which corporations may be organized and corpo rate powers of every nature obtained subject nevertheless to repeal or alteration at the will of the legislature The effect of these restrictions is very strikingly shown by a comparison of the number and kind of acts passed by the New Jersey legislature during the threeyear period 1 Virginia Constitution I869 art 3 i120 2 New Jersey Constitution x844 art 4  7 245 6566 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY I872I874 preceding the adoption of the amendment and the period 18761878 after its adoption During the first period the average number of acts passed was 624 of which i I were classified in the volume of session laws as general and 513 as special For the second period the average number of acts was 219 of which I88 were classified as general and thirtyone as special The adoption of the amendment seems therefore to have reduced the total volume of legislation 65 per cent and the number of special acts 94 per cent and to have increased the number of general acts 70 per cent Virginia voted in May to hold a constitutional convention It will be interesting to see whether the convention in draft ing a new constitution will follow the now almost universal practice of restricting special legislation Florida adopted a constitutional amendment in November prohibiting the creation of corporations except universities and ship canals by special act Of the 242 acts and resolu tions passed by Florida in 1899 twentyfive were special acts relating to corporations The amendment should there fore diminish the present volume of legislation about Io per cent The Mississippi legislature has exercised a certain degree of selfcontrol in the matter of special legislation by authoriz ing the auditor and land commissioner to settle claims for taxes erroneously paid correct errors in land descriptions cancel patents to lands in certain cases and make rebates In New York a constitutional amendment was proposed by the legislature of 1899 but not repassed by the legisla ture of I900 prohibiting the passage of a special or private bill granting exemption from taxation1 The need of further constitutional restrictions or of the exercise of legislative selfcontrol in the matter of special legislation in New York is very great During the period I894I899 there was an annual average of 589 special to 243 general acts passed 1 N Y I899 p 1605 246POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION There was an average of 183 special city fiftythree special village twentysix special town and twentynine special county acts making in all 291 special acts dealing with local governmental organization November 3 1874 a number of constitutional amendments restricting special legislation were adopted and while they reduced the annual output of legislation about onehalf the natural increase in special legislation in lines not touched on in the amendments has in the course of a quarter century brought up the annual average to a point only about o1 per cent below that prevail ing previous to the adoption of the amendments For the three years I871I873 there was an annual average of 904 acts and for the years i876I878 an average of but 447 while for the past seven years the average has been 832 By the passage of a few general laws the annual output of legislation in New York might be greatly reduced Each year an average of twentyseven amendments to the fish and game laws are passed seventeen of which apply to but one or two counties A general law conferring on county boards of supervisors power to pass fish and game regula tions subject to the approval of the state commissioners of fisheries game and forests would considerably relieve the legislature Moreover many of the details now prescribed by the fish and game laws might well be left to regulations of the state board The state board of railroad commis sioners now exercises an extensive quasijudicial authority that obviates the necessity for numerous special acts and this method of control could be profitably extended to a number of other fields The effect of the prohibition of special city legislation on the volume of legislation has been shown by the experience of Wisconsin In November 1892 a constitutional amend ment was adopted prohibiting the incorporation of a city or the amendment of its charter by special act As a result of this amendment the total number of laws passed has been reduced more than onequarter and the number of pages of 247 6768 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY law more than onehalf During the six years 18869r there was an annual average of 266 laws covering 993 pages while for the period I89398 there was an annual average of 191 laws covering 412 pages In this connection the experience of Illinois is also instruc tive It is a great state with varied interests and like New York has had to deal with the problem of a big and rapidly growing city It has a general law for the incorporation of all cities most of the provisions of which apply to all alike Instead of going into great detail the law merely prescribes the general organization and gives to the city council power to adapt the more detailed organization to the changing needs of the city With an annual average of 183 special city acts the sus pensive veto over such acts given to the mayor of cities of the first class and to the mayor and council of other cities by the constitution of I894 seems to have proven totally inadequate to cope with the evil Annual SessionsRhode Island has been holding two sessions of its legislature yearly an annnal session being held at Newport beginning on the last Tuesday in May and an adjourned session at Providence beginning in January The January session held at Providence has usually lasted into May after which the Newport session beginning the last Tuesday in May has usually lasted till the latter part of June A constitutional amendment was adopted at the November election providing for a single annual session at Providence beginning on the first Tuesday in January1 Statutory RevisionIn 1889 New York created a statu tory revision commission to revise certain of the general statutes of the state It was supposed that the commission would complete its task in two or three years at most but the work of revision has been continued from year to year and is still unfinished The scope of the undertaking was soon broadened to cover the entire field of statutory law A 1R I I900 j r I 248POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION number of the revision bills prepared by the commission have not been acted on by the legislature partly owing to the fact that a great deal of new law is contained in them and the legislature is unwilling to accept them without careful examination Much dissatisfaction having arisen with the slow progress of the work and with the proposed method of revising the code of civil procedure the com mission was abolished1 and the question of revision referred to a joint committee The committee is making a careful examination of the subject and will report to the legislature of 1901 In 1896 South Carolina created the office of code commis sioner2 The commissioner is elected by the legislature for ten years and must prepare a complete revision of the general statutes and the code of civil procedure in I90o and every ten years thereafter He receives a salary of 400 a year During g9oo official compilations of statutes were issued by Missouri Nevada North Dakota West Virginia and Wyoming and unofficial compilations were issued for Illi nois Kansas and North Carolina Drafting of BillsIn 1893 it was made the duty of the New York Statutory Revision Commission just referred to on request of either house of the legislature or of any committee member or officer thereof to draft or revise bills to render opinions as to the constitutionality consistency or other legal effect of proposed legislation and to report by bill such measures as they deem expedient 3 The services of the commission have been made use of to a very consid erable extent in the drafting of bills For the session of 1899 the commission reports that it prepared about five hun dred bills at the request of members of the legislature besides examining and rewriting a large number originally prepared elsewhere With the abolition of the commission 1 N Y 900o ch 664 2 S C I896 ch i a N Y I893 ch 24 g 2 249 6970 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY during the past year there is as yet no statutory provision for the performance of this most important and useful work but it is understood that three of the assistants on the former commission will be retained by the legislature of I901 to continue it For the drafting of bills special technical knowledge that can only be acquired by much practice is essential Each bill must be adjusted to an existing intri cate system and its object must be expressed concisely clearly and with legal precision It is moreover highly important for clearness and ease of construction that all acts passed should be alike as to form Great Britain and many of the British colonies and provinces have official draftsmen who draft most of the bills at the request of members Besides New York South Carolina is the only state in the Union that has provided any similar authority In the latter state at the session of i868 immediately after the adoption of a new constitution an act was passed requiring the attorneygeneral when requested by either branch of the general assembly to attend during their sessions and give his aid and advice in the arrangement and preparation of legislative documents and business1 In I880 the attor neygeneral was authorized to require the assistance during legislative sessions of the state solicitors in the eight judicial districts of the state2 They must under the direction of the attorneygeneral supervise the engrossing and enrolling of bills passed and assist the attorneygeneral in the drafting of bills and in other work connected with the session They receive the same per diem as do members of the legislature In 9goo Massachusetts provided that the attorneygeneral shall on request give advice to legislative committees as to the legal effect of proposed measures3 Uniform LegislationIn I890 New York created a uni form legislation commission and at present similar commis 1 S C Statutes at Large V 14 No 2 2 Id V 17 No 249 8 Mass 900o ch 373 250POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION 7I sions exist in thirtytwo states and territories In I896 the national conference of state commissioners on uniform legis lation recommended for adoption by the various states a general act relating to negotiable instruments This act has now been adopted by fifteen states and the District of Columbia but none of these were added to the list in I900 The national conference held at Saratoga Springs in August I900 recommended the adoption by the various states of a uniform law relative to divorce procedure The proposed law provides that no divorce shall be granted for any cause arising prior to the residence of the complainant or defendant in the state which was not a ground for divorce in the state where the cause arose that no person shall be entitled to a divorce for any cause arising in the state who has not been an actual resident of the state for one year or for any cause arising out of the state unless the complainant or defendant has resided in the state for two years Service of notice on defendant is provided for with special care No divorce is to be granted solely on default or solely on admis sions by the pleadings or except on hearing before the court in open session After divorce either party may marry again but in cases where notice has been given by publication only and the defendant has not appeared no decree for divorce becomes final till six months after the decision The pur pose of the proposed law is first to do away with migratory divorces second to prevent the granting of speedy decrees against absent defendants who may be ignorant of any suit pending and third to do away with the interstate confusion arising from some few states forbidding remarriage while a great majority of the states permit it

agents to file a written author ization from the person or corporation by whom they are employed The Wisconsin act was passed in 18991 It applies to persons corporations or associations and specially exempts municipalities and other public corporations With this exception the act substantially follows that of Massachusetts The Maryland act was passed in I9oo and like that of Wisconsin follows very closely that of Massachusetts2 It however contains an entirely new clause providing that the governor whenever any bill is presented for his approval and he has reason to believe that in connection with its passage improper expenses have been incurred may require any or all legislative counsel and agents and their employers to render a complete and detailed sworn statement of all expenses incurred In 1897 Tennessee passed an act declaring lobbying a felony and defining it as personal solicitation of any kind not addressed solely to the judgment3 In the same year West Virginia prohibited lobbying on the floor of either house while the legislature is in session4 ConstitutionsNew Hampshire and Virginia have voted to hold constitutional conventions The present constitution of New Hampshire was adopted in 1792 and has since been amended but three times In I85I a constitutional conven tion proposed three amendments one of which was accepted by the people the convention of

The present constitution was adopted in I869 SuffrageThe constitutional amendment submitted to vote in North Carolina to disfranchise the illiterate negro was adopted and goes into effect in July I9021 The pro posed plan is similar to that adopted by Louisiana in i8982 and makes ability to read and write a section of the consti tution a qualification for voting This provision applies to whites and blacks alike but there is a proviso that it shall not apply to any person entitled to vote in any state prior to January i 1867 or to the lineal descendant of such person who registers before January I I908 It is in effect an ingenious device to disfranchise illiterate negroes without also disfranchising illiterate whites and still keep within the letter of the fifteenth amendment providing that the right to vote shall not be denied on account of race color or pre vious condition of servitude Mississippi adopted an educational qualification in I890 which went into effect January I I892 and the South Caro lina convention in I897 adopted an alternative educational or property qualification which went into effect January i I898 Florida Georgia and Alabama are the only states remaining in the black belt of the South that have not restricted the franchise by constitutional provision and Florida has accomplished practically the same result through a peculiar method of voting In June I9oo Oregon rejected a woman suffrage amend ment to the constitution by a vote of 28402 to 26265 Woman suffrage exists in four states Wyoming Idaho Utah and Colorado PrimariesCalifornia

certain designated popu lation The amendment was submitted because of a supreme court decision declaring unconstitutional the primary law of 1897 on account of the provision prescribing the qualifica tions for voting1 The Legislature of I899 that submitted the amendment also passed a new primary law2 Under this act primary elections are conducted by officers appointed by the local election commissioners and are held at the same time and place for all parties casting 3 per cent of the vote An official ballot with party columns and blank spaces to be filled in with names of delegates preferred is provided and the expense of the primaries is a public charge The Louisiana legislature has adopted a law that shows none of the recent tendency toward state control8 It provides simply for the regulation of primaries by party committees subject to simple requirements as to notice officers etc Voting MachlinesThe voting machine is gradually win ning its way into public favor It was

manipulation and fraud is much reduced It secures a secret ballot in all cases and can be operated without assistance even by an illiterate Ingenious methods have been devised to violate the secrecy of the Australian ballot but it seems that the voting machine is proof against all such schemes With it the only way to bribe and be sure that value is received is to bribe to stay away from the polls

adoption of the merit system It provided for the appoint ment by the mayor with the consent of the council of a board of three civil service commissioners for terms of twelve years The salary of the commissioners was fixed at 3000 and no person was eligible for appointment who had been a candidate for or who had held any municipal office within four years and no member of the commission could during his term of office be a candidate for or hold any state national or local office nor be a member of any municipal political committee or convention nor be eligible for any state office within four years of the expiration of his term of office The mayor could remove any commissioner for misconduct on rendering a statement of the cause to the council The names of persons passing examinations were to be certified in order of their relative excellence as determined by exami nation without reference to priority of time of examination No officer or employee in the classified service could be removed except for cause on written charges and after hear ing the charges to be investigated by the board of civil service commissioners or by some officer or board appointed by the commission but any officer could suspend a subordi nate for a period not exceeding thirty days The stringent provisions of this law are all nullified by that of I9oo This act reorganizes the board so that it shall consist of the mayor treasurer comptroller and two mem bers appointed by the mayor who shall hold office during the term of the mayor All candidates securing an average of 70 per cent on examination are eligible to appointment The appointment is on probation for six months and after that time entitles the appointee to hold the position until the expiration of the term of office of the appointing officer The board is required to hold an examination within thirty days after the opening of each new municipal administra tion In every such general examination all persons either 257 7778 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY holding or desiring to hold positions in the classified civil service are obliged to participate A long list of officers and employees is exempted from the provisions of the act All lists of candidates eligible for appointment prepared by the former board are rendered void and all offices and positions subject to the provisions of the act are vacated The act can scarcely be considered an application of the merit system as it seems especially designed to secure a clean sweep with each new administration Municipal GovernmentA joint legislative committee has been appointed in Iowa to revise and codify special assess ment laws and such other municipal laws as it may deem necessary1 In New York the Governor appointed a com mission of fifteen persons to revise the charter of New York city2 and its report has been recently submitted to the legis lature The bill prepared by the Ohio municipal code com mission appointed in 1898 and which was submitted to the legislature

by the state supreme court on the ground that the Legislature cannot delegate such power to consumers with out providing for a judicial investigation ofthe reasonable ness of the rates established3 Iowa has authorized cities and towns to establish heating plants assess taxes for them and fix regulations for corporations or individuals supplying heat4 Louisiana has authorized municipalities to expro priate private gas and electric light plants5 and Texas has made it unlawful for cities and towns to lease or sell water systems except by vote of the electors6 Ia igoo ch 176 2 N Y 900oo ch 465

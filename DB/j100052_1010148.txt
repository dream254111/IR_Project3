COVERED BY THIS REVIEW OCTOBER I 1899 TO OCTOBER  900OO THIRTEEN STATES HELD REGULAR2 AND FOUR HELD EXTRA3 SESSIONS ONLY SIX STATES HAVE ANNUAL SES SIONS AND ALL BUT EIGHT OF THOSE HAVING BIENNIAL SESSIONS HOLD THEM IN ODD YEARS5 SO THAT THERE IS ONLY ABOUT HALF AS MUCH STATE LEGISLATION IN EVEN AS IN ODD YEARS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ACTS AND RESOLUTIONS PASSED DURING THIS OFF YEAR WAS 5886 OF WHICH VIRGINIA PASSED 1485 NEW YORK 777 MARYLAND 758 OHIO 636 MASSACHUSETTS 594 NEW JERSEY 201 SOUTH CAROLINA I8I AND KENTUCKY 40 GENERAL VS SPECIAL LEGISLATIONIN THE ANNUAL SUMMARY AND INDEX OF STATE LEGISLATION ISSUED BY THE NEW YORK STATE LIBRARY 1469 OF THESE 5886 LAWS ARE SUMMARIZED THE ANNUAL SUMMARY INCLUDES ALL GENERAL LAWS AND A FEW SPE CIAL AND TEMPORARY LAWS OF GENERAL INTEREST SO THAT IT IS SAFE TO SAY THAT THREEFOURTHS OF THE LAWS PASSED WERE SPECIAL OF THE 1485 LAWS PASSED BY VIRGINIA ONLY 152 OR A LITTLE MORE THAN ONETENTH WERE GENERAL WHILE IN NEW JERSEY OVER FOUR FIFTHS OF THE 20I LAWS PASSED WERE GENERAL THE DIFFERENCE IS DOUBTLESS DUE TO THE RESTRICTIONS ON SPECIAL LEGISLATION CON TAINED IN THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION IN VIRGINIA THE ONLY RESTRICTION ON SPECIAL LEGISLATION IS THE PROVISION THAT THE LEGISLATURE MAY NOT GRANT DIVORCES CHANGE NAMES DIRECT THE 1 FOR PREVIOUS ARTICLES ON  POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION  SEE ANNALS FOR MAY 1896 VOL VII PP

DISABILITY OR GRANT RELIEF IN ANY OTHER CASE WHERE COURTS OR OTHER TRIBUNALS HAVE JURISDICTION1 UNTIL I875 THE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION MERELY PROHIBITED THE GRANTING OF DIVORCES AND THE SALE OF LAND OF PERSONS UNDER LEGAL DISABILITY BY SPECIAL ACT BUT IN THAT YEAR AN AMENDMENT WAS ADOPTED RESTRICTING SPECIAL LEG ISLATION WITHIN NARROW LIMITS2 THIS AMENDMENT PROVIDES THAT NO GENERAL LAW SHALL EMBRACE ANY PROVISION OF A SPECIAL CHARACTER THAT NO SPECIAL BILL SHALL BE PASSED UNLESS PUBLIC NOTICE OF INTENTION TO APPLY FOR IT HAS BEEN PREVIOUSLY GIVEN AND THAT SPECIAL ACTS SHALL NOT BE PASSED

FOR BY GENERAL LAWS THE LEGISLATURE SHALL PASS NO SPECIAL ACT CONFERRING CORPORATE POWERS BUT THEY SHALL PASS GENERAL LAWS UNDER WHICH CORPORATIONS MAY BE ORGANIZED AND CORPO RATE POWERS OF EVERY NATURE OBTAINED SUBJECT NEVERTHELESS TO REPEAL OR ALTERATION AT THE WILL OF THE LEGISLATURE THE EFFECT OF THESE RESTRICTIONS IS VERY STRIKINGLY SHOWN BY A COMPARISON OF THE NUMBER AND KIND OF ACTS PASSED BY THE NEW JERSEY LEGISLATURE DURING THE THREEYEAR PERIOD 1 VIRGINIA CONSTITUTION I869 ART 3 I120 2 NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION X844 ART 4  7 245 6566 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY I872I874 PRECEDING THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT AND THE PERIOD 18761878 AFTER ITS ADOPTION DURING THE FIRST PERIOD THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ACTS PASSED WAS 624 OF WHICH I I WERE CLASSIFIED IN THE VOLUME OF SESSION LAWS AS GENERAL AND 513 AS SPECIAL FOR THE SECOND PERIOD THE AVERAGE NUMBER OF ACTS WAS 219 OF WHICH I88 WERE CLASSIFIED AS GENERAL AND THIRTYONE AS SPECIAL THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENT SEEMS THEREFORE TO HAVE REDUCED THE TOTAL VOLUME OF LEGISLATION 65 PER CENT AND THE NUMBER OF SPECIAL ACTS 94 PER CENT AND TO HAVE INCREASED THE NUMBER OF GENERAL ACTS 70 PER CENT VIRGINIA VOTED IN MAY TO HOLD A CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHETHER THE CONVENTION IN DRAFT ING A NEW CONSTITUTION WILL FOLLOW THE NOW ALMOST UNIVERSAL PRACTICE OF RESTRICTING SPECIAL LEGISLATION FLORIDA ADOPTED A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT IN NOVEMBER PROHIBITING THE CREATION OF CORPORATIONS EXCEPT UNIVERSITIES AND SHIP CANALS BY SPECIAL ACT OF THE 242 ACTS AND RESOLU TIONS PASSED BY FLORIDA IN 1899 TWENTYFIVE WERE SPECIAL ACTS RELATING TO CORPORATIONS THE AMENDMENT SHOULD THERE FORE DIMINISH THE PRESENT VOLUME OF LEGISLATION ABOUT IO PER CENT THE MISSISSIPPI LEGISLATURE HAS EXERCISED A CERTAIN DEGREE OF SELFCONTROL IN THE MATTER OF SPECIAL LEGISLATION BY AUTHORIZ ING THE AUDITOR AND LAND COMMISSIONER TO SETTLE CLAIMS FOR TAXES ERRONEOUSLY PAID CORRECT ERRORS IN LAND DESCRIPTIONS CANCEL PATENTS TO LANDS IN CERTAIN CASES AND MAKE REBATES IN NEW YORK A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS PROPOSED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF 1899 BUT NOT REPASSED BY THE LEGISLA TURE OF I900 PROHIBITING THE PASSAGE OF A SPECIAL OR PRIVATE BILL GRANTING EXEMPTION FROM TAXATION1 THE NEED OF FURTHER CONSTITUTIONAL RESTRICTIONS OR OF THE EXERCISE OF LEGISLATIVE SELFCONTROL IN THE MATTER OF SPECIAL LEGISLATION IN NEW YORK IS VERY GREAT DURING THE PERIOD I894I899 THERE WAS AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 589 SPECIAL TO 243 GENERAL ACTS PASSED 1 N Y I899 P 1605 246POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION THERE WAS AN AVERAGE OF 183 SPECIAL CITY FIFTYTHREE SPECIAL VILLAGE TWENTYSIX SPECIAL TOWN AND TWENTYNINE SPECIAL COUNTY ACTS MAKING IN ALL 291 SPECIAL ACTS DEALING WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION NOVEMBER 3 1874 A NUMBER OF CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENTS RESTRICTING SPECIAL LEGISLATION WERE ADOPTED AND WHILE THEY REDUCED THE ANNUAL OUTPUT OF LEGISLATION ABOUT ONEHALF THE NATURAL INCREASE IN SPECIAL LEGISLATION IN LINES NOT TOUCHED ON IN THE AMENDMENTS HAS IN THE COURSE OF A QUARTER CENTURY BROUGHT UP THE ANNUAL AVERAGE TO A POINT ONLY ABOUT O1 PER CENT BELOW THAT PREVAIL ING PREVIOUS TO THE ADOPTION OF THE AMENDMENTS FOR THE THREE YEARS I871I873 THERE WAS AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 904 ACTS AND FOR THE YEARS I876I878 AN AVERAGE OF BUT 447 WHILE FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS THE AVERAGE HAS BEEN 832 BY THE PASSAGE OF A FEW GENERAL LAWS THE ANNUAL OUTPUT OF LEGISLATION IN NEW YORK MIGHT BE GREATLY REDUCED EACH YEAR AN AVERAGE OF TWENTYSEVEN AMENDMENTS TO THE FISH AND GAME LAWS ARE PASSED SEVENTEEN OF WHICH APPLY TO BUT ONE OR TWO COUNTIES A GENERAL LAW CONFERRING ON COUNTY BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS POWER TO PASS FISH AND GAME REGULA TIONS SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE STATE COMMISSIONERS OF FISHERIES GAME AND FORESTS WOULD CONSIDERABLY RELIEVE THE LEGISLATURE MOREOVER MANY OF THE DETAILS NOW PRESCRIBED BY THE FISH AND GAME LAWS MIGHT WELL BE LEFT TO REGULATIONS OF THE STATE BOARD THE STATE BOARD OF RAILROAD COMMIS SIONERS NOW EXERCISES AN EXTENSIVE QUASIJUDICIAL AUTHORITY THAT OBVIATES THE NECESSITY FOR NUMEROUS SPECIAL ACTS AND THIS METHOD OF CONTROL COULD BE PROFITABLY EXTENDED TO A NUMBER OF OTHER FIELDS THE EFFECT OF THE PROHIBITION OF SPECIAL CITY LEGISLATION ON THE VOLUME OF LEGISLATION HAS BEEN SHOWN BY THE EXPERIENCE OF WISCONSIN IN NOVEMBER 1892 A CONSTITUTIONAL AMEND MENT WAS ADOPTED PROHIBITING THE INCORPORATION OF A CITY OR THE AMENDMENT OF ITS CHARTER BY SPECIAL ACT AS A RESULT OF THIS AMENDMENT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LAWS PASSED HAS BEEN REDUCED MORE THAN ONEQUARTER AND THE NUMBER OF PAGES OF 247 6768 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY LAW MORE THAN ONEHALF DURING THE SIX YEARS 18869R THERE WAS AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 266 LAWS COVERING 993 PAGES WHILE FOR THE PERIOD I89398 THERE WAS AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 191 LAWS COVERING 412 PAGES IN THIS CONNECTION THE EXPERIENCE OF ILLINOIS IS ALSO INSTRUC TIVE IT IS A GREAT STATE WITH VARIED INTERESTS AND LIKE NEW YORK HAS HAD TO DEAL WITH THE PROBLEM OF A BIG AND RAPIDLY GROWING CITY IT HAS A GENERAL LAW FOR THE INCORPORATION OF ALL CITIES MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH APPLY TO ALL ALIKE INSTEAD OF GOING INTO GREAT DETAIL THE LAW MERELY PRESCRIBES THE GENERAL ORGANIZATION AND GIVES TO THE CITY COUNCIL POWER TO ADAPT THE MORE DETAILED ORGANIZATION TO THE CHANGING NEEDS OF THE CITY WITH AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF 183 SPECIAL CITY ACTS THE SUS PENSIVE VETO OVER SUCH ACTS GIVEN TO THE MAYOR OF CITIES OF THE FIRST CLASS AND TO THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL OF OTHER CITIES BY THE CONSTITUTION OF I894 SEEMS TO HAVE PROVEN TOTALLY INADEQUATE TO COPE WITH THE EVIL ANNUAL SESSIONSRHODE ISLAND HAS BEEN HOLDING TWO SESSIONS OF ITS LEGISLATURE YEARLY AN ANNNAL SESSION BEING HELD AT NEWPORT BEGINNING ON THE LAST TUESDAY IN MAY AND AN ADJOURNED SESSION AT PROVIDENCE BEGINNING IN JANUARY THE JANUARY SESSION HELD AT PROVIDENCE HAS USUALLY LASTED INTO MAY AFTER WHICH THE NEWPORT SESSION BEGINNING THE LAST TUESDAY IN MAY HAS USUALLY LASTED TILL THE LATTER PART OF JUNE A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT WAS ADOPTED AT THE NOVEMBER ELECTION PROVIDING FOR A SINGLE ANNUAL SESSION AT PROVIDENCE BEGINNING ON THE FIRST TUESDAY IN JANUARY1 STATUTORY REVISIONIN 1889 NEW YORK CREATED A STATU TORY REVISION COMMISSION TO REVISE CERTAIN OF THE GENERAL STATUTES OF THE STATE IT WAS SUPPOSED THAT THE COMMISSION WOULD COMPLETE ITS TASK IN TWO OR THREE YEARS AT MOST BUT THE WORK OF REVISION HAS BEEN CONTINUED FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND IS STILL UNFINISHED THE SCOPE OF THE UNDERTAKING WAS SOON BROADENED TO COVER THE ENTIRE FIELD OF STATUTORY LAW A 1R I I900 J R I 248POLITICAL AND MUNICIPAL LEGISLATION NUMBER OF THE REVISION BILLS PREPARED BY THE COMMISSION HAVE NOT BEEN ACTED ON BY THE LEGISLATURE PARTLY OWING TO THE FACT THAT A GREAT DEAL OF NEW LAW IS CONTAINED IN THEM AND THE LEGISLATURE IS UNWILLING TO ACCEPT THEM WITHOUT CAREFUL EXAMINATION MUCH DISSATISFACTION HAVING ARISEN WITH THE SLOW PROGRESS OF THE WORK AND WITH THE PROPOSED METHOD OF REVISING THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE THE COM MISSION WAS ABOLISHED1 AND THE QUESTION OF REVISION REFERRED TO A JOINT COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE IS MAKING A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE SUBJECT AND WILL REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE OF 1901 IN 1896 SOUTH CAROLINA CREATED THE OFFICE OF CODE COMMIS SIONER2 THE COMMISSIONER IS ELECTED BY THE LEGISLATURE FOR TEN YEARS AND MUST PREPARE A COMPLETE REVISION OF THE GENERAL STATUTES AND THE CODE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE IN I90O AND EVERY TEN YEARS THEREAFTER HE RECEIVES A SALARY OF 400 A YEAR DURING G9OO OFFICIAL COMPILATIONS OF STATUTES WERE

THE CONSTITUTIONALITY CONSISTENCY OR OTHER LEGAL EFFECT OF PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND TO REPORT BY BILL SUCH MEASURES AS THEY DEEM EXPEDIENT 3 THE SERVICES OF THE COMMISSION HAVE BEEN MADE USE OF TO A

BE RETAINED BY THE LEGISLATURE OF I901 TO CONTINUE IT FOR THE DRAFTING OF BILLS SPECIAL TECHNICAL KNOWLEDGE THAT CAN ONLY BE ACQUIRED BY MUCH PRACTICE IS ESSENTIAL EACH BILL MUST BE ADJUSTED TO AN EXISTING INTRI CATE SYSTEM AND ITS OBJECT MUST BE EXPRESSED CONCISELY CLEARLY AND WITH LEGAL PRECISION IT IS MOREOVER HIGHLY IMPORTANT FOR CLEARNESS AND EASE OF CONSTRUCTION THAT ALL ACTS PASSED SHOULD BE ALIKE AS TO FORM GREAT BRITAIN AND MANY OF THE BRITISH COLONIES AND PROVINCES HAVE OFFICIAL DRAFTSMEN WHO DRAFT MOST OF THE BILLS AT THE REQUEST OF MEMBERS BESIDES NEW YORK SOUTH CAROLINA IS THE ONLY STATE IN THE UNION THAT HAS PROVIDED ANY SIMILAR AUTHORITY IN THE LATTER STATE AT THE SESSION OF I868 IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE ADOPTION OF A NEW CONSTITUTION AN ACT WAS PASSED REQUIRING THE ATTORNEYGENERAL WHEN REQUESTED BY EITHER BRANCH OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY TO ATTEND DURING THEIR SESSIONS AND GIVE HIS AID AND ADVICE IN THE ARRANGEMENT AND PREPARATION OF LEGISLATIVE DOCUMENTS AND

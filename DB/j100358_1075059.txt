J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075059,THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS AS AN AID IN THE ACQUISITION OF A VOCABULARY,I244602,THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS AS AN AID IN THE ACQUISITION OF A VOCABULARY EDITH FURNAS FRIENDS UNIVERSITY WICHITA KAN A SHORT HISTORY OF THE PUBLICATIONS ON THE SUBJECT OF SYN ONYMS IS GIVEN BY OTTO LYON IN HIS INTRODUCTION TO EBERHARDS DICTIONARY OF SYNONYMS LEIPZIG TH GRIEBEN IN SUBSTANCE HE SAYS THE REAL FOUNDER OF GERMAN SYNONYMS IS SAMUEL ERNST STOSCH WHO WAS THE FIRST TO GIVE NOT ONLY A MERE TABLE OF WORDS BUT ALSO EXPLANATIONS AND DISTINCTIONS OF MEANING HE HOWEVER MODELED HIS WORK INVESTIGATIONS OF THE RIGHT USE OF GERMAN WORDS SIMILAR IN MEANING AFTER ABBE GIRARDS SYNONYMS WHICH APPEARED IN PARIS IN 1718 STOSCHS CAREFUL BUT TOO EXTENSIVE WORK IS BASED UPON AN ERROR WHICH CAUSED MANY MISTAKES AND CONTRADICTIONS HE ASSUMES THAT SYNONYMSI 16 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ARE WORDS IDENTICAL IN MEANING IN THIS ERROR HE FOLLOWS THE EXAMPLE OF GIRARD EVEN TODAY THE FRENCH REGARD THEM AS WORDS ABSOLUTELY IDENTICAL THE DICTIONARY OF THE ACADEMY DEFINES A SYNONYM AS A WORD WHICH HAS THE SAME MEANING AS ANOTHER WORD THE REVISION OF THE WORKS ON SYNONYMS WHICH THE GERMAN SOCIETY OF MANNHEIM MADE PUT ASIDE THIS ERRONEOUS DEFINITION AND DEFINED THEM AS WORDS RELATED IN MEANING THIS SOCIETY PUBLISHED IN 1794 THEIR WORK KNOWN AS SINNVERWANDTE WIIRTER AND REVISIONS OF THE SAME FOLLOWED ALL THESE WORKS HOWEVER ARE INFERIOR TO EBERHARDS DICTIONARY OF SYNONYMS PUBLISHED IN 1802 IN CLOSING THIS PREFACE LYON ADDS THAT FORMERLY A TREATISE ON THE WORTH AND SIGNIFICANCE OF SYNONYMS WAS ADDED TO THESE DICTIONARIES THIS HE SAYS IS NO LONGER NECES SARY TODAY SINCE IT SEEMS TO BE UNIVERSALLY RECOGNIZED AT PRESENT THAT A MORE THAN SUPERFICIAL KNOWLEDGE OF SYNONYMS ASSISTS GREATLY THE POWER OF EXPRESSING ONESELF CLEARLY EASILY AND FORCIBLY IN ANY LANGUAGE ANYONE WHO HAS EVER ATTEMPTED THE MASTERY OF A FOREIGN LANGUAGE CAN FULLY APPRECIATE THE TRUTH OF THIS STATEMENT WE MAY BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE NECESSITIES OR OBTAIN ENOUGH FOOD TO SUSTAIN LIFE WITHOUT SYNONYMS BUT AS SOON AS WE ATTEMPT TO ENTER INTO ANYTHING WORTHY OF THE NAME CONVERSATION WE MEET WITH SERIOUS DIFFICULTIES LIKE THE ARTIST WHO USES THE VARIED COLORS AND MANY SHADES TO PRODUCE THE IDEAL EFFECT SO WE MUST BE EQUIPPED WITH A STORE OF WORDS SIMILAR AND YET DISTINCT IN MEANING TO PRODUCE THE WORD PICTURE OF OUR THOUGHT IN HIS DEUTSCHER STYL LYON GIVES MORE SPECIFIC REASONS FOR THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS IN THE EXPRESSION OF IDEAS ONE MUST BE CAREFUL THAT THE THOUGHT MAY NOT BECOME CONFUSED THROUGH THE USE OF WORDS OF MORE THAN ONE MEANING OR THROUGH THE USE OF WORDS RELATED IN MEANING AS TO THE FORMER THE MEAN ING WILL USUALLY BE CLEAR FROM THE CONTEXT BUT THE RIGHT USE OF SYNONYMS LIKE STOLZ AND HOCHMUT BESCHEIDENHEIT AND DEMUT DEMANDS MORE ATTENTION BECAUSE THE IDEAS ARE RELATED THE WORDS ARE EASILY EXCHANGED AND OFTEN A THOUGHT IS EXPRESSED WHICH ONE DID NOT INTEND CLEARNESS AND CONCISENESS AS WELL AS BEAUTY OF STYLE DEMAND A CAREFUL OBSERVATION OF THE FINE DISTINCTIONS OF SYNONYMS WHICH TEACH US TO EXPRESS AND DISTINGUISH RELATED IDEAS BY SPECIFIC WORDS WHOEVER FAILS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN WORDS LIKE BESCHIMPFENTHE STUDY OF SYNONYMS 117 DEMIITIGEN ENTEHREN HERABSETZEN AND ERNIEDRIGEN WILL CONTINUALLY USE THESE EXPRESSIONS UNFITTINGLY AND DESTROY THE CLEARNESS AND BEAUTY OF STYLE NO CONSCIENTIOUS STUDENT CAN FAIL TO SEE THE SELFEVIDENT TRUTH OF THESE ASSERTIONS AS TO THE VALUE OF THIS STUDY THE REFORM METHOD FAVORS DEFINING THE FOREIGN WORD IN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND GIVING THE ENGLISH MEANING ONLY IN EXTREME CASES THE SYNONYMS ARE ALSO EXPLAINED AND THE DIS TINCTIONS MADE CLEAR IN THE FOREIGN TONGUE THEN THE STUDENT IS ASKED TO FORM SENTENCES CONTAINING THE NEW WORDS LEARNED AND ILLUSTRATING THEIR DISTINCTIONS IN MEANING BY THE TIME THESE DISTINCTIONS HAVE BEEN WORKED OUT THE WORDS ARE INDELIBLY STAMPED ON THE MIND WITHOUT ANY CONSCIOUS EXERTION OF THE MEMORY WHICH IS CERTAINLY A MUCH MORE INTERESTING METHOD THAN TO COMMIT COLUMNS OF PROMISCUOUS WORDS IT MAY SEEM AT FIRST A SOMEWHAT SLOW AND TEDIOUS PROCESS BUT PRACTICAL APPLI CATION PROVES IT TO BE A VERY RAPID AS WELL AS SATISFACTORY WAY TAKE FOR EXAMPLE THE TWO WORDS DEMUT AND BESCHEIDENHEIT WHOEVER FEARS TO OVERESTIMATE HIS OWN WORTH SHOWS DEMUT BUT HE WHO LIMITS HIMSELF IN HIS CLAIMS THOUGH THEY ARE WELL GROUNDED BESCHEIDENHEIT THIS CERTAINLY BRINGS A MORE DEFINITE AND HENCE A MORE LASTING IMPRESSION TO OUR MINDS THAN IF WE MERELY DEFINE DEMUT AS HUMILITY AND BESCHEIDENHEIT MODESTY OR AGAIN ENTEHREN ERNIEDRIGEN HERABWIIRDIGEN DEMIITIGEN BESCHIMPFEN AND HERABSETZEN ERNIEDRIGEN IS THE MOST GENERAL AND MEANS A DIMINISHING OF THE OUTER OR INNER VALUE OF A PERSON IF THE VALUE IS MERELY AN OUTWARD ONE FOR INSTANCE THAT THROUGH WHICH ONE RECEIVES HIS POSITION IN SOCIETY THE DECREASING OF IT IS A HERABSETZEN LOWER HERABWIIRDIGEN DE GRADE REFERS TO THE INNER VALUE OF A PERSON OR THING DEMIITI GEN HUMILIATE ADDS TO THE IDEA OF THE SUFFERERS OWN JUDGMENT OF HIS SHORTCOMINGS ONE BESCHIMPFT THAT ONE FROM WHOM ONE TAKES THE SIGNS OF HONOR AND TO WHOM ONE CAUSES OTHERS TO REFUSE THE SIGNS OF HONOR ENTEHREN IS THE HIGHEST DEGREE OF ERNIEDRIGUNG THERE ARE SO MANY WORDS OF WHOSE MEANING WE HAVE ONLY A CONFUSED OR VAGUE IDEA AND WHICH WE NEVER USE WHEN WE HAVE ONCE ANALYZED THESE CAREFULLY AND COMPARED THEM WITH OTHER WORDS WE FEEL THE RIGHT OF OWNERSHIP ANDII8 THE SCHOOL REVIEW ACTUALLY MAKE THEM OUR OWN WE MAY KNOW ABOUT A CITY BUT NOT UNTIL WE HAVE VISITED ITS SHOPS AND PARKS AND COMPARED IT WITH OTHER 6ITIES CAN WE SPEAK OF IT WITH A PERSONAL INTEREST WITH A BEGINNER OF COURSE CARE WOULD HAVE TO BE USED IN THE SELECTION OF SYNONYMS ONLY THE MOST SIMPLE AND STRIKING EXAMPLES SHOULD BE CHOSEN BUT ADVANCED PUPILS WITH A MODER ATE VOCABULARY COULD EASILY USE A TEXT LIKE EBERHARDLYON A VERY MATERIAL AID TO THE REFORM METHOD WOULD BE THE PUB LICATION OF DICTIONARIES WHICH DEFINED THE WORDS IN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE BUT IN SIMPLE ENOUGH TERMS TO BE UNDERSTOOD BY A BEGINNER THE TEACHER MAY BE ABLE TO REMEDY THE LACK BY MAKING NEW OR SIMPLIFYING DEFINITIONS YET IT SEEMS AN ARDUOUS AND UNNECESSARY TASK SUPPOSE WE TAKE A SIMPLE GERMAN STORY AND WORK THROUGH IT DEFINING ALL NEW WORDS IN GERMAN AND LEARNING THEIR SYNONYMS WE MAY AT FIRST READ BUT HALF A PAGE A DAY YET WHEN WE HAVE FINISHED OUR VOCABULARY IS MANY TIMES RICHER THAN IF WE HAD READ IT IN THE USUAL WAY IT WOULD BE FOLLY TO ASSUME THAT THERE IS NO MENTAL EFFORT REQUIRED IN THIS METHOD BUT THE LARGE ELEMENT OF INTEREST SAVES IT FROM BEING DRUDGERY THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS INVOLVES ALSO A RIGOROUS MENTAL DISCIPLINE AND FORCES ONE TO THINK IN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE THE MUCHDESIRED GOAL OF EVERY LANGUAGE STUDENT AS ANOTHER BYPRODUCT MIGHT BE MENTIONED A CULTIVATION OF FEELING FOR THE LANGUAGE A NATIVE IMBIBES NATURALLY A CERTAIN FEELING FOR DISTINCTIONS IN WORDS BUT A FOREIGNER MUST USE ALL THE STILTS AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO CULTIVATE THIS FEELING SO THAT HERE AGAIN WE FIND THE STUDY OF SYNONYMS INVALUABLE CONSIDERING THE QUESTION FROM BOTH SIDES I AM THOROUGHLY CONVINCED THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT LINE OF PROCEDURE FOR THE MODERN LANGUAGE TEACHER IF WE HOPE TO REALIZE OUR IDEALS THE SPLENDID RESULTS ALREADY OBTAINED ARE THE ONLY RECOMMENDATION NECESSARY FOR THE METHOD WHICH IS THE BEST BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST NATURAL

J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015243,AFTERWORD,I242691,AFTERWORD THE WRITER AND HIS CRITICS SEEM TO BE DISCUSSING THE LIVINGCOST BASIS FROM VIEWPOINTS OF DIFFERENT BREADTH FOR THE MOST PART PROFESSOR FEIS AND DR DRURY SPEAK CONSCIOUSLY OR UNCON SCIOUSLY IN TERMS OF WAGE ADJUSTMENTS IN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY IN A PARTICULAR LOCALITY OR RESTRICTED REGION EVEN IN A SINGLE PLANT DR DRURY FOR INSTANCE TALKS ABOUT TRANSFERRING TO THE WORKERS SOME OF THE DIFFERENTIAL PROFITS OF THE MORE FAVORED OR BETTER MANAGED PLANT HE AND OTHERS ALSO CLAIM THE POSSIBILITY OF TRANSFERRING SOME OF THE PROFITS OF AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY TO THE WORKERS BY MEANS OF WAGERATE ADVANCES PROFESSOR FEIS IN PARTICULAR PUTS FORTH THE PROPOSITION TO LIMIT PROFITS TO SOME FAIR RATE BY ADVANCING WAGERATES TO ABSORB ANY EXCESS OF PROFITS OVER SUCH A RATE NOW THE WRITER HAS ALREADY SHOWN THAT A WAGERATE INCREASE THAT IS CON FINED TO A SINGLE PLANT OR TO A FEW PLANTS IN AN INDUSTRY MAY COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE PROFITS OF THE EMPLOYERS AFFECTED INDEED THAT A RATE ADVANCE THAT IS GEN ERAL TO AN ENTIRE INDUSTRY MAY TO SOME EXTENT AND FOR A WHILE COME OUT OF PROFITS BECAUSE THE PUBLIC IN ITS CON SUMING CAPACITY REDUCES ITS CONSUMP TION OF THE PRODUCT MOST OF THE ADVANTAGE SO GAINED HOWEVER IS AT THE EXPENSE OF WAGE EARNERS IN OTHER INDUS TRIES OVER AGAINST THE RATE ADVANCE IS THE LOSS FROM REDUCED EMPLOYMENT FINALLY WHEN THE PROCESS OF ADJUSTMENT WITHIN THE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN COMPLETED THE DISAPPEARANCE OF SOME EM PLOYERS THE RETARDATION OF THE GROWTH OF THE INDUSTRY UNTIL THE NEEDS OF THE GROWING POPULATION CATCH UP WITH ITS CAPACITY AT THE HIGHER COSTS AND PRICES THERE IS NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT ANY OF THE ADVANTAGE HELD BY THOSE WORKERS WHO REMAIN IN THE INDUSTRY IS AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR EMPLOYERS PROFITS 91 INADEQUACY OF LIVINGCOST BASIS IN UNIVERSAL APPLICATION THE VIEWPOINT FROM WHICH THE WRITER DISCUSSED THE LIVINGCOST BASIS WAS THAT OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATION SO LONG AS THE APPLICATION IS RESTRICTED TO A SMALL PART OF THE WHOLE WAGEEARNING POPULATION TO ONE PLANT TO ONE LOCALITY EVEN TO ONE OR A FEW INDUSTRIESIT WILL BE EFFEC TIVE IN PART AT LEAST THE NARROWER THE RESTRICTION THE GREATER IS THE EFFECT HOWEVER THE SUCCESS OF ONE GROUP OF WORKERS IN GETTING THEIR WAGE DEMANDS GRANTED IS THE SIGNAL FOR OTHER GROUPS TO MAKE SIMILAR DEMANDS AS THE WAGE ADJUSTMENT EXTENDS THROUGH PLANT AFTER PLANT LOCALITY AFTER LOCALITY INDUSTRY AFTER INDUSTRY THE ADVANTAGE GAINED IN THE EARLIER ADJUSTMENTS DIMINISHES AND FADES AWAY BY THE TIME THE WAGE AD VANCE HAS BECOME UNIVERSAL IT WILL HAVE BECOME INEFFECTIVE IE UNLESS IT HAS BEEN APPLIED IN SUCH MANNER AS GENERALLY TO HAVE INCREASED THE RATE OF PRODUCTION PER MANYEAR IN THE WRITERS VIEW ANY ALLEGED PRINCIPLE THAT BRINGS ITS OWN DEFEAT WHEN CARRIED OUT TO ITS LOGICAL CONCLUSION IS NOT A VALID PRINCIPLE MR GOMPERS SAYS WE WAGE EARN ETS KNOW THAT FROM TIME TO TIME WE HAVE INCREASED OUR HOME COMFORTS BY FORCING A MORE EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOMES CERTAINLY THEY HAVETHOSE THAT OBTAINED THE INCREASES THIS WOULD BE THE CASE WHETHER THE RATE ADVANCE THEY FORCED CAME IN THE VANGUARD OF THE RATE MOVEMENT IN WHICH CASE THE AFFECTED WORKERS FARED BETTER FORAWHILE PARTLY AT THE EXPENSE OF THEIR EMPLOYERS MAINLY AT THE EXPENSE OF THE REMAINING MASS OF WORKERS OR IN THE REARGUARD TO RELIEVE THE DEPRIVATION TO WHICH THOSE WHO PRECEDED THEM IN THE MOVE MENT HAD SUBJECTED THEM THE PRE CEDING SENTENCE ASSUMES MERELY FORTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY SAKE OF THE ARGUMENT THAT BEFORE THE RATE MOVEMENT COMMENCED THE RATES OF ALL WORKERS WERE JUSTLY PROPORTIONED ONE TO ANOTHER ALSO THAT THE RATE ADVANCES WERE RATE ADVANCES ONLY IE WERE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY INCREASED PRODUCTIVITY WE HAVE ELSEWHERE INTI MATED THAT SOME GROUPS OF WORKERS MAY BE UNDERPAID AS COMPARED WITH OTHER GROUPS FURTHERMORE WE RECOGNIZE THAT SELECTING ONE GROUP OF LOWPAID UNDERNOURISHED WORKERS AND DELIB ERATELY OVERPAYING THEM MAY HAVE THE EFFECT OF INCREASING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY WE INSIST HOWEVER THAT IF AND WHEN EVER WE DECIDE TO DO THIS ALL PARTIES SHOULD KNOW PRECISELY WHAT IS BEING ATTEMPTED RATE INCREASES A MATTER OF PRO PORTION IT SHOULD BE DISTINCTLY RECOGNIZED THAT THE GENERAL RATE INCREASES THE WRITER IS DISCUSSING ARE PROPORTIONATE INCREASES WE ARE CONSIDERING WAGE ADJUSTMENTS IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN LIVING COST IF THERE SHOULD AS A MAT TER OF PRINCIPLE BE ANY SUCH ADJUST MENTS THE RATE ADVANCE THAT SHOULD FOLLOW A 10 PER CENT ADVANCE IN LIVING COST SHOULD BE A 10 PER CENT ADVANCE NOT A FLAT FIVEDOLLARAWEEK ADVANCE PROFESSOR FEIS PROPOSES EITHER THE LATTER OR A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO THE ONLY LOGICAL JUSTIFICATION OF THIS COURSE IS THAT THE LOWERPAID WORKERS ARE UNDERPAID AS COMPARED WITH THE HIGHERPAID WORKERS BUT IF THIS IS TRUE SURELY THE PROPER COURSE OF ACTION IS TO CORRECT THE INEQUITABLE PROPOR TIONS IRRESPECTIVE OF WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A CHANGE IN THE COST OF LIVING THE BASIS OF SUCH A CORRECTION MUST BE A RELATIVE VALUATION OF THE VARIOUS KINDS OF WORK IE RELATIVE RATING THE WRITER HAS BEEN REPRESENTED AS MAKING CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS THAT COM PETITION WORKS PERFECTLY THAT A UNIFORM WAGERATE EXISTS FOR ALL PLANTS THAT IN DUSTRIAL MOTIVES ARE UNCHANGING THAT ALL PRICE ADVANCES ARE CAUSED BY WAGE RATE INCREASES THAT THE MARGINAL PRO DUCTIVITY THEORY AS APPLIED TO LABOR AND TO INDUSTRIAL ESTABLISHMENTS IS VALID AS TRADITIONALLY EXPOUNDED IN TEXTS ON ECONOMICS THE WRITER HAS MADE NO SUCH ASSUMPTIONS HIS UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAWS THAT GOVERN THE DIVISION OF THE PRODUCT OF INDUSTRY IS ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES REMOVED FROM THE MARGINAL PRODUCTIVITY THEORY AS TRADITIONALLY EXPOUNDED HE KNOWS FROM ACTUAL OBSERVATION THAT COMPETITION IS NEITHER UNIVERSAL NOR GUIDED BY FULL INFORMA TION THAT THERE ARE MANY PLANTS WHOSE MANAGEMENT IS SO INEFFICIENT THAT THEY SURVIVE ONLY BY REIMBURSING THEMSELVES FOR THE WASTES OF MISMANAGEMENT OUT OF THE WAGERATES OF THEIR EMPLOYES HE WOULD FEEL NO COMPUNCTION ABOUT ELIMI NATING THESE BY ADJUSTING THE WAGERATES OF THEIR EMPLOYES TO PROPER RELATION SHIP TO OTHER WAGERATES AND EVENTUALLY TRANSFERRING THEIR BUSINESS AND THEIR EMPLOYES TO THEIR MORE EFFICIENTLY MAN AGED COMPETITORS HOWEVER RELATIVE RATING NOT LIVING COST IS THE PROPER BASIS ON WHICH TO DO THIS NOR CAN HE SEE DR DRURYS CONSISTENCY IN WISHING AT ONE POINT TO LEVEL UP RATES BY ELEVAT ING THOSE OF THESE EXPLOITED WORKERS IN HIS MARGINAL PLANTS AND AT ANOTHER POINT TO MAKE THEM DIVERGE AGAIN BY RAISING RATES IN THE MORE FAVORED OR BETTER MANAGED PLANTS IN ORDER TO APPROPRIATE FOR THE WORKERS A PART OF THE DIFFERENTIAL PROFITS NOR DOES THE WRITER ASSUME THAT ALL PRICE ADVANCES ARE CAUSED BY WAGE RATE ADVANCES HE DOES ASSUME HOW EVER THAT GENERAL PRICE ADVANCES OR RECESSIONS DO NOT COME WITHOUT CAUSE AND THAT WHATEVER THE CAUSEINFLATION OF THE CURRENCY DECREASED PRODUCTIVITY OF INDUSTRY SUCH AS OCCURRED DURING THE DISORGANIZATION PREVAILING IN THE WAR PERIOD POPULATION INCREASE OUTSTRIP PING THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE PRODUCTIVEAFTERWORD ARTS AND THE ACCUMULATION OF CAPITAL THAT CAUSE IS OPERATING JUST AS EFFEC TIVELY AFTER AN ARBITRARY WAGE ADVANCE AS BEFORE HE DOES NOT ASSUME THAT INDUSTRIAL MOTIVES DO NOT CHANGE HOWEVER HE SEES NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE MOTIVES THAT ACTUATE THE PROFIT PUR SUER THE LANDOWNER OR THE SAVER ARE MADE ANY WEAKER OR ANY STRONGER BY A MERE WAGERATE INCREASE OR DECREASE IF ONE COULD GRASP THE IDEA THAT UNDER OUR MOREORLESSCOMPETITIVEPRIVATE INITIATIVE PROFIT MOTIVATEDINDIVIDUAL FREEDOMFORM OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZA TION THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THE PRODUCT OF INDUSTRY IS DIVIDED AMONG THE VARIOUS FACTORPERSONS ARE THE EVER CHANGING RESULTANT OF A VERY INTRICATE CLASH OF HUMAN WILLSCOMMODITY COM PETING WITH COMMODITY IN THE MIND OF EACH CONSUMER PRODUCER COMPETING WITH PRODUCER IN SELLING EMPLOYER COMPETING WITH EMPLOYER FOR LABOR WORKER COMPETING WITH WORKER FOR EM PLOYMENT CONSUMER COMPETING WITH CONSUMER IN THE PURCHASE OF COMMODI TIES AND SO ONHE SHOULD EASILY COM PREHEND THAT NO MERE GENERAL PROPOR TIONATE WAGERATE ADVANCE OR RECESSION THAT EMPLOYERS WOULD NOT HAVE GRANTED OR EXACTED IN ANY EVENT IS GOING TO HAVE MORE THAN A PASSING INFLUENCE UPON THESE DISTRIBUTIVE PROPORTIONS PRO FESSOR FEIS AND DR DRURY CAN IMPROVE THE WELLBEING OF RESTRICTED GROUPS OF WORKERS FOR A WHILE BY RESTRICTING THE AREA OF THEIR OPERATIONS HOWEVER WHEN IT COMES TO GENERAL APPLICATION PROFESSOR FEIS PROPOSITION TO LIMIT PROFITS TO SOME FAIR RATE BY MEANS OF WAGERATE ADVANCES UNACCOMPANIED BY PRICE CONTROL REMINDS THE WRITER OF THE SCANDINAVIAN GOD THORS ATTEMPT TO DRAIN A CERTAIN GOBLET AT ONE DRAUGHT ONLY TO DISCOVER WHEN EXHAUSTION OF HIS CAPACITY COMPELLED HIM TO DESIST THAT THE BOTTOM OF THE GOBLET WAS SECRETLY CONNECTED WITH THE OCEAN 7 DETERMINATION OF NORMAL PROPOR TIONS AS GUIDES IN WAGE DISPUTES PROFESSOR CARVER CONTENTS HIMSELF WITH STATING A PRINCIPLE WHICH IS OUR OLD FRIEND THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND WE HAVE STATED THAT THE FINAL TEST OF THE RELATIVE ACCURACY OF ANY SYSTEM OF WAGERATES IS THEIR RELATIVE POWER OF ATTRACTING AND HOLDING WORKERS IN THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THEY ARE WANTED DISPUTES DO ARISE HOWEVER AND CASES DO COME BEFORE WAGE BOARDS OR ARBITRATORS FOR DECISION IN SUCH CASES THE LAW OF SUPPLY AND DEMAND IS NOT VERY HELPFUL TO THE ADJUDICATOR WE HAVE ASSUMED THAT AMID ALL THE VARYING MARKET PROPORTIONS THERE IS A SET OF NORMAL PROPORTIONS AMONG THE WAGERATES FOR THE VARIOUS GRADES OF WORK AND THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL NOT ONLY TO ADJUDICATORS BUT TO PLANT MAN AGERS TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC AND TO ALL CONCERNED IF THESE NORMAL PROPORTIONS WERE DETERMINED OR AT LEAST CLOSELY APPROXIMATED AND USED AS A GUIDE TO DECISIONS THE ONLY EMPLOYER WHO CONTRIBUTED A DISCUSSION WHICH EVEN HE AFTERWARDS WITHDREW WHILE AGREEING WITH THE WRITERS POSITION CONCERNING THE LIVING COST BASIS THINKS THAT THE SUGGESTED PROCEDURE FOR RELATIVE RATING OUT TAYLORS TAYLOR IN THE MATTER OF DETAIL OF SCIENTIFIC STUDY THAT THE WORK INVOLVED WOULD BE ENDLESS THAT IT WOULD BE INEFFECTIVE ANYWAY UNLESS AGREED UPON AND LIVED UP TO BY EM PLOYERS AND EMPLOYES A STIPULATION WHICH HE CONSIDERS TO BE HOPELESS AND THAT AFTER ALL THE PROPOSITION CONTAINS NOTHING NEW HOWEVER THE UNION SCALE AND OTHER SCALES OF WHICH HE SPEAKS ARE NOT BASED ON CAREFULLY DETERMINED PERFORMANCE STANDARDS WHICH ARE AN INDISPENSABLE ELEMENT IN ANY RELATIVE RATING THAT IS WORTHY OF THE NAME IF THE PROPOSITION WERE TO ESTABLISH A GOV ERNMENTAL COMMISSION TO MAKE COM 93THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY PREHENSIVE DETAILED SCIENTIFIC STUDIES ESTABLISH RELATIVE VALUATIONS OF THE MYRIADS OF OPERATIONS AND RIGOROUSLY APPLY THEM THROUGHOUT INDUSTRY WE SHOULD AGREE THAT SUCH A COURSE IS EN TIRELY IMPRACTICAL PARTICULARLY AT THE PRESENT STAGE OF DEVELOPMENT THE WRITERS PURPOSE IS TWOFOLD VIZ 1 TO SHOW THE FALLACY AND UNSATISFAC TORINESS OF THE LIVINGCOST BASIS AND TO SUBSTITUTE ANOTHER BASIS AND PROCEDURE IN THE MINDS OF ALL PARTIES TO WAGE DIS PUTES ESPECIALLY IN THE MIND OF THE ARBITRATOR HOWEVER ROUGH THE APPLICA TION MAY HAVE TO BE AT THIS JUNCTURE 2 TO SET UP A GOAL TOWARD WHICH FU TURE DEVELOPMENT MAY CONSCIOUSLY PROGRESS THE GREAT BULK OF THE STUDY IS NOT GOING TO BE DONE BY ANY GOVERN MENTAL AGENCY BUT WITHIN INDIVIDUAL PLANTS IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES A FEW ENLIGHTENED EMPLOYERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN APPLYING THE IDEA FOR SOME TIME WITH MUTUAL SATISFACTION TO THEM SELVES AND THEIR EMPLOYES THEY FIND IT AN ADVANTAGEOUS SUBSTITUTE FOR THE HAP HAZARD TRIALANDERROR METHOD OF AP PLYING THE LAW OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY THEIR NUMBERS WILL INCREASE WHEN SUFFICIENT PROGRESS HAS THUS BEEN MADE WITHIN PLANTS IN EACH OF THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IT WILL THEN BE FEASIBLE TO BRING THE RESULTS TOGETHER IN INTER INDUSTRY RELATIVE RATING THERE IS HOWEVER THE IMPORTANT NEED OF STAND ARDIZING THE PROCEDURE AND METHODS OF INVESTIGATION AND RATING SO THAT THE RESULTS CAN BE BROUGHT TOGETHER MR PORTENAR WHO FOLLOWS A PRINT ING TRADE SAYS IF THE RESULTS OF YOUR RELATIVE RATING AND THE UNION SCALE COINCIDE CLOSELY THERE WILL NOT BE ANY TROUBLE AT THAT MOMENT IF YOU LET US IN ON THE MAKING OF IT IT WILL LUBRICATE THE PROCESS WHEN WE LOOK THROUGH THIS MORE OR LESS COMPETITIONRESTRAINED PROFITMOTIVATED PRIVATE INITIATIVE WHICH IS MERELY THE EXTERNAL FORM OF OUR INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATION TO THE UNDERLYING REAL PURPOSE OF IT WHICH IS THE MAXIMUM ECONOMIC WELLBEING NOT OF ANY ONE PERSON CLASS OR GROUP BUT OF ALL WE CANNOT SEE THAT THE WORKERS RIGHT TO BE LET IN ON THE MAKING CAN VALIDLY BE DENIED VALID JUDGMENT BASED ON PRODUC TIVITY AND NORMAL RELATIONSHIP WE RECOGNIZE THAT EMPLOYERS WHO WISH TO BUILD UP THEIR WORK FORCES MORE RAPIDLY THAN THE GROWTH OF THE POPULA TION AND DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS ELSE WHERE WILL PERMIT ARE GOING TO EXCEED ANY SCALE RATES THAT MAY BE AGREED UPON HOWEVER IT IS NOT LIKELY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THE RANGE OF VARIATION OF RATES WITHIN THE SAME OCCUPATION OR GRADE OF WORK THAT WE NOW HAVE WE ASSUME THAT GROUPS OF WORKERS WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE AGAINST THEIR WAGERATE WE HOPE AT LEAST THAT EACH INDIVIDUAL WILL PERSISTENTLY SURGE AGAINST HIS WAGERATE AND CON TINUOUSLY PREPARE HIMSELF TO RENDER SERVICE OF HIGHER AND HIGHER VALUE HOWEVER WHEN GROUPS SURGE THE GENERAL PUBLIC NEEDS A MEANS OF VALIDLY JUDGING THE MERITS OF THE SURGE SO DOES THE ARBITRATOR OF WAGE DISPUTES WE HOLD THAT THE EFFECTIVE ISSUE IS WHETHER THE PARTICULAR WAGERATES DE MANDED SUBSTANTIALLY RESTORE THE NOR MAL RELATIONSHIP WITH THE GENERAL MASS OF OTHER WAGERATES FINALLY WHEN ALL PARTIES COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT PRACTICALLY THE WAGE QUESTION IS A QUESTION FIRST OF THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INDUSTRY SECOND OF PROPORTION BETWEEN THE INCOMES OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF WORKERS AND NOT OF DIVISION BETWEEN WORKERS AND EM PLOYERS WE BELIEVE THAT SUCH RECOGNI TION WILL MAKE FOR GREATER STABILITY OF INDUSTRY AND FOR BETTER COOPERATION OF EMPLOYES WITH EMPLOYERS TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INDUSTRY AND PROVIDE MORE TO DIVIDET W MITCHELL 1 CF

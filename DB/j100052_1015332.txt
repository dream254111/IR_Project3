J100052,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF POLITICAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCE,1015332,THE BUILDING COMPLEX,I242687,THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY THE BUILDING COMPLEX BY A D WELTON CONTINENTAL AND COMMERCIAL NATIONAL BANK CHICAGO N COMMON WITH ALL OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION WAS INFLUENCED BY THE WAR THE DEMAND FOR IT FOUND STIMULATION IN THE GENERAL BUSINESS  ACTIVITY THAT ACCOMPANIED EXPANSION BUT BUILDING MATERIALS WERE NOT THE SUBJECT OF PRIORITY ORDERS AND IN 1918 THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY MADE AN APPEAL TO THE PUBLIC TO STOP ALL BUT NECESSARY BUILDING THE DIVER SION OF BUILDING MATERIALS TO WAR WORK HAD A PRONOUNCED EFFECT AND CREDIT FOR BUILDING WHEN NOT FROWNED ON BY ANY OF THE NUMEROUS WAR BOARDS WAS RE STRICTED BY VOLUNTARY ACTION OF THOSE IN CONTROL OF IT IF NOT BY THE POTENTIAL BORROWERS THEMSELVES PRICE VAGARIES PRICES FOR LABOR AND MATERIALS WENT SKYWARD WITH OTHER PRICES AND ARE COM ING DOWN WITH EVEN GREATER RELUCTANCE AMONG THE PRICE INDEX NUMBERS BUILD ING MATERIAL IS FOUND TO BE ONE OF THE MOST INDUSTRIOUS PERFORMERS IN COM PARISON WITH THE ALLCOMMODITIES INDEX NUMBER IT MOVED UP MORE SLOWLY BUT IT KEPT ON ADVANCING AFTER OTHER PRICES HAD STOPPED AND WAS EXCEEDED ONLY BY HOUSE FURNISHING GOODS IN THE LATEST COMPARISONS1 AT THE TIME FOLLOWING THE ARMISTICE WHEN A RESUMPTION OF BUILDING MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED THE BUILDING MATE RIAL INDEX NUMBER REACHED NEW HIGH POINTS IN JANUARY 1920 IT WAS 268 WITH ALL COMMODITIES AT 248 IN APRIL IT WAS 341 WITH ALL COMMODITIES AT 265 AND WHEN THE LATTER REACHED ITS MAXI MUM OF 272 IN MAY 1920 BUILDING MATERIALS STOOD AT 341 IT HAS RECEDED SLOWLY REACHING THE LOW POINT OF 202 1 THE BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS INDEX NUM BERS OF WHOLESALE PRICES ARE CITED IN MAY LAST WHEN THE ALLCOMMODITY NUMBER WAS 151 ONLY THE NUMBER FOR HOUSE FURNISHING GOODS WAS HIGHER ANALYSES OF THE BUILDING SITUATION WHILE THE BUILDING MATERIAL PRICES WERE MAKING THESE RECORDS BUILDING WAS ALMOST AT A STANDSTILL THE COUNTRY OVER THERE WERE MANY SURVEYS OF THE SITUA TION THE ADVANCE OF RENTS TO UNPREC EDENTED FIGURES CALLED ALL KINDS OF LEGIS LATIVE BODIES INTO ACTION THERE WERE INVESTIGATIONS RECOMMENDATIONS SUG GESTIONS NEW LAWS COURT PROCEEDINGS VAST AMOUNTS OF PUBLICITY AND DEFENSE ORGANIZATIONS FORMED BY TENANTS TO COMBAT THE GREED OF PROFITEERING LAND LORDS THE UNITED STATES SENATE AP POINTED A SELECT COMMITTEE ON RE CONSTRUCTION AND PRODUCTION WITH SENATOR W M CALDER OF NEW YORK AS CHAIRMAN THIS COMMITTEE HELD HEARINGS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE COUN TRY AND SUBMITTED A REPORT ON MARCH 2 1921 THE REPORT IS PERHAPS MORE INTERESTING FOR ITS INFORMATION THAN ITS CONCLUSIONS AND SUGGESTIONS OF REMEDY BY LEGISLATION AND NO SMALL PART OF THE INTEREST IS AROUSED BY ITS DISSONANCES RATHER THAN ITS CONSONANCES THIS IS NOT SURPRISING IN SUCH SURVEYS THERE IS ALWAYS A PRONOUNCED TENDENCY TO CONFUSE CAUSES AND EFFECTS AND SEARCH FOR THE FORMER IS LIKELY TO LEAD AFIELD ESPECIALLY WHEN CONDITIONS ARE NOT YET SETTLED THE REPORT IS NONE THE LESS A VERY VALUABLE CONTRIBUTION THE NEW YORK LEGISLATURE APPOINTED A COMMITTEE TO INVESTIGATE THE BUILDING SITUATION THE ILLINOIS LEGISLATURE DID LIKEWISE AND IN BOTH INSTANCES THERE WAS UNCOVERED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE OF COMBINATIONS IN RESTRAINT OF TRADE 128THE BUILDING COMPLEX CONSPIRACIES AGREEMENTS BRIBERY AND COLLUSION TO WARRANT CRIMINAL INDICT MENTS AND IN SOME INSTANCES CONVIC TIONS HAVE ALREADY BEEN SECURED MATERIAL MEN CONTRACTORS AND LABOR LEADERS WERE INVOLVED AND THE INVESTI GATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLETED BUILDING DETERRENTS EVEN CURSORY EXAMINATION OF THE BUILDING SITUATION WILL DISCLOSE THAT IT WAS INFLUENCED BY THE MANY FACTORS THAT ENTERED INTO THE GENERAL DISLOCA TION ATTEMPTS TO ATTRIBUTE CONDITIONS TO ANY ONE CAUSE MUST FAIL AND THE AP PLICATION OF ANY ONE REMEDY WOULD FAIL AS DECISIVELY WAGES THEIR INCREASE AND STUBBORN MAINTENANCE AT THE HIGH LEVEL HAVE BEEN FREQUENTLY GIVEN AS THE ONE OR CHIEF DETERRENT TO NEW BUILDING ENTER PRISES IT HAS BEEN ONE DETERRENT OF VARYING FORCE IN DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES BUT IT HAS PROBABLY BEEN NO GREATER A DETERRENT THAN LABOR INEFFICIENCY WHICH CANNOT BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF DOLLARS THE PRICE OF BUILDING MATERIALS HAS BEEN A DETERRENT BUT PRICE AT TIMES WAS NO MORE EFFECTIVE TO STAY THE DESIRE TO BUILD THAN SCARCITY OF MATERIALS SEN ATOR CALDERS COMMITTEE WENT BEYOND THE QUESTION OF THE PRICE OF MATERIALS IN THE EFFORT TO FIND CAUSES IT FIXED ON COAL COAL MINING AND COAL DISTRIBU TION AS A FUNDAMENTAL CAUSE OF THE HIGH PRICE OF BUILDING MATERIALS WITH TRANS PORTATION AND ITS COST AND INEFFICIENCY IN SECOND PLACE AND THE DIRECTION OF CREDIT IN THIRD COAL IS PLACED AS THE GREAT SINNER FOR A TIME IT PUSHED EVERYTHING ELSE OFF THE RAILWAYS IT SOUGHT AND RECEIVED OR WAS NATURALLY GIVEN PRIORITY WHILE BUILDING WAS UNDER THE WAR BAN COAL WAS GAMBLED IN HELD BACK MADE SHORT BY STRIKES STORED IN CARS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES AND FINALLY WAS BID UP TO A FIGURE THAT FOUND 10 REFLECTION IN THE PRICE OF BUILDING MATE RIALS LIKE LIME BRICK AND CEMENT HOWEVER IN THE SAME REPORT IT APPEARS THAT SUBSEQUENTLY COAL WAS PLENTIFUL IF NOT CHEAP THAT THERE WERE MANY THOUSANDS OF IDLE CARS THAT THE CONSUMING PUBLIC WAS ALL BUT TEARFULLY ASKED TO BUY IMMEDIATELY AND STILL BUILDING MATERIALS WERE HIGH AND BUILD ING LAGGED BUT COAL AND ITS CARRIAGE MUST BE GIVEN POSITION AS A CONTRIBUT ING CAUSE TO THE FAILURE OF A RESUMPTION OF BUILDING IN THE ENUMERATION OF CAUSES OF THE BUILDING SLUMP THE BANKERS CAME IN FOR FREQUENT AND VIGOROUS DENUNCIATION FOR WITHHOLDING CREDIT THE FEDERAL RE SERVE INSURANCE COMPANIES WHICH MAKE MORTGAGE LOANS WERE PILLORIED AND THE BUILDERS AND REAL ESTATE OPERA TORS SEEMED TO TAKE PARTICULAR JOY IN HAMMERING THESE FORCES BUILDING SHORTAGE REAL THE DEFINITE INFORMATION TO BE GAINED FROM STUDY OF THE CURRENT HISTORY OF BUILDING CONSTRUCTION IS THAT THERE IS A SHORTAGE OF BUILDING THE COUNTRY OVER AT THE TIME THIS IS WRITTEN THE SHORTAGE IS FINDING LITTLE TO ALLEVIATE IT BUILDING IS GAINING A LITTLE EVERY WHERE IN COMPARISON WITH THE DULLER PERIODS BUT GENERALLY CONSTRUCTION WORK IS WAITING FOR RELEASE FROM THE DOMINATION OF PRICES THAT ARE STILL HIGH AND CONDITIONS THAT MAKE FOR COSTS BEYOND THE PROBABLE REPLACEMENT VALUE TWO OR THREE YEARS HENCE MONEY WHICH GOES INTO THE CONSTRUCTION OF BUILDINGS IS RETURNED SLOWLY THE INVESTMENT IS USUALLY AMORTIZED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF YEARS WHEN THERE IS PROSPECT OF A FALL IN WAGES OR MATERIALS BUILDING BE COMES A HIGHLY SPECULATIVE ADVENTURE THE BUILDING OF TODAY WILL HAVE TO MEET THE COMPETITION OF THE NEW ONE BUILT TOMORROW WITH CHEAPER MATERIALS AND 129THE ANNALS OP TIE AMERICAN ACADEMY LABOR IF IT DOES MEET THAT COMPETI TION PART OF THE MONEY USED FOR ITS CONSTRUCTION MUST BE CHARGED OFF AS LOSS THE VALUE MUST BE WRITTEN DOWN TO MEET THE NEW SCALE OF PRICE AND WAGES VARIOUS ESTIMATES OF THE BUILDING SHORTAGE ARE CURRENT AT THE ANNUAL CONVENTION OF REAL ESTATE MEN IN CHICAGO IN JULY HERBERT HOOVER SAID I NEED NOT RECOUNT TO YOU THAT THE CAUSE OF THIS CRITICAL PROBLEM HAS BEEN THE DIVER SION OF OUR ECONOMIC STRENGTH FROM PER MANENT CONSTRUCTION TO MANUFACTURE OF CONSUMABLE COMMODITIES DURING AND AFTER THE WAR IN 1910 WE AVERAGED ABOUT 110 FAMILIES FOR EACH 100 HOMES AND IN 1920 ABOUT 117 FAMILIES THIS INDICATES A SHORT AGE OF NEARLY 1500000 HOMES EVEN ON THE 1910 STANDARD MR HOOVER ALSO ASSERTED THAT 60 PER CENT OF THE POPULATION IS LIVING AS TEN ANTS WHICH HE CONSIDERED TOO LARGE A PROPORTION FOR SOCIAL SAFETY THE BUILDING SHORTAGE IS REAL THE BEST AND MOST RECENT STUDY OF IT IS THAT OF MR A G WHEELER IN THE BANKERS ECONOMIC SERVICE SPECIAL ANALYSIS JUNE 21 TO JULY 12 MR WHEELER EXPLAINS THIS TABLE AS FOLLOWS WE SEE THAT DURING THE TWELVE YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING WITH 1909 AND ENDING WITH 1920 ONLY THREE YEARS SHOW A SURPLUS OF RELATIVE VOLUME OVER NORMAL BUILDING OPERATIONS WHILE NINE YEARS SHOW A DEFICIT AND THAT THE FINAL RESULT IS A NET DEFICIT OF 2884600000 IN RELATIVE VOLUME THIS AMOUNT THEN EXPRESSES THE RELATIVE SHORTAGE OF TABLE IBUILDING OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES FOR THE

UNITED STATES ALTHOUGH WHEN THE AMOUNT IS RELEASED FROM ITS SUBJECTION TO THE PRICE LEVEL2 IT BECOMES 8884568000 WHICH STATES IT IN THE TERMS COMMONLY USED THE REAL SHORTAGE HOWEVER IS EXPRESSED BY THE PREVIOUS FIGURE THE RATIOS OF BUILDING OPERATIONS GIVEN IN THE TABLE3 SAYS MR WHEELER SHOW THE PER CENT OF NORMAL BUILDING ATTAINED EACH YEAR NORMAL IS OF COURSE HYPOTHETICAL AND IN THE PRESENT INSTANCE IS ARRIVED AT BY USING THE AVERAGE OF THE FIVEYEAR PERIOD 1909 1913 AS A BASE FROM WHICH TO DRAW THE VOLUME OF BUILDING PER CAPITA FOR A REPRESENTATIVE PERIOD THIS PER CAPITA AMOUNT IS THEN APPLIED TO THE POPULA TIONS GROWTH AT THE VARIOUS POINTS EACH YEAR TO DATE HOUSING SHORTAGE THE CHIEF IRRITATION POINT MR WHEELER GIVES DEFINITE INFORMA TION IT COMPELS THE CONCLUSION THAT MUCH BUILDING IS REQUIRED TO BRING CON DITIONS TO NORMAL EVERYWHERE NOR MAL HOWEVER IS A HYPOTHETICAL TERM AS MR WHEELER POINTS OUT THE TABLES SHOW THAT THERE IS A TENDENCY TO OVER BUILD WHICH BECOMES STRONGLY PRO NOUNCED AT TIMES BUILDING ALSO IS A GENERAL TERM IT INCLUDES MANY STRUC TURES BESIDES RESIDENCES IT IS THE LACK OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS WHICH HAS CAUSED MOST OF THE DISCUSSION IT IS THE SHORT AGE OF THESE THAT HAS OPENED THE WAY FOR THE INCREASE OF RENTS THESE IN CREASES FELL WITH THE GREATEST FORCE ON THE PEOPLE LEAST ABLE TO BEAR THEM THE HARDSHIPS THAT FOLLOWED WERE VERY REAL THE RENT PROFITEERS WERE UNPOP ULAR THEY WERE OPENLY TAKING ADVAN 2 WITH THE CHANGE IN THE INDEX FIGURE FOUND IN COLUMN III THERE WILL BE CHANGE IN THE DOLLAR ENUMERATION OF THE BUILDING SHORTAGE THIS HOWEVER WILL NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIOUS ESTI NATES OF THE SHORTAGE WHICH APPEAR FROM TIME TO TIME THEY ARE MERE GUESSES 3 TABLE III TAGE OF THE SITUATION NOT ONLY WERE RENTS ENORMOUSLY INCREASED ESPECIALLY IN THE LARGE CITIES BUT EVERY EFFORT WAS MADE TO COMPEL THE SIGNING OF LONG TERM LEASES AT THE ADVANCED RATES THE OUTCRIES WERE LONG AND LOUD THOUSANDS OF PLANS WERE OFFERED AS A MEANS OF AIDING TENANTS AND PUNISHING LANDLORDS THERE WERE SOME NEW LAWS AND SOME RESTRAINTS IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF OLD ONES BUT GENERALLY THE LAW AFFORDED SCANT RELIEF IT PROBABLY WAS LESS EFFECTIVE THAN THE PUBLICITY INTER FERENCE WITH THE RIGHTS OF OWNERS OF PROPERTY IS VERY DIFFICULT IN THIS COUNTRY OF ANGLOSAXON INSTITUTIONS THERE WERE ELEMENTS IN THE SITUATION EVEN AT THE STAGE OF ITS ACUTENESS WHICH SHOWED THE FUTILITY OF THE EFFORT TO ADAPT PERMANENT REMEDIES TO A TRANSI TORY CASE IN NEW YORK FOR INSTANCE A SURVEY SHOWED THAT THERE WERE THOU SANDS OF BUILDINGS UNOCCUPIED THEY WERE DEVOID OF CONVENIENCES AND NO ONE SEEMED INTERESTED TO LIVE IN THEM IN CHICAGO THERE WERE ALWAYS VACANT TENE MENTS THE PEOPLE HOWEVER HAD BEEN PROSPEROUS WAGES WERE HIGH MONEY WAS PLENTIFUL AND WITH CHARAC TERISTIC ANMERICAN DESIRE THE DEMAND WAS FOR DWELLINGS AND APARTMENTS EQUIPPED WITH ALL MANNER OF MODERN CONVENIENCES THERE WAS A STEADY NIOVEMENT FROM OLD BUILDINGS TO NEW OR BETTER ONES SO LONG AS ANY WERE OBTAINABLE THE LAG IN HOME BUILDING TRANSITORY A NOTABLE FEATURE OF ANY MOVEMENT FOR BUSINESS EXPANSION IS THE POSITION OF REAL ESTATE AND BUILDING IN THE SCHEME WHICH INVOLVES INCREASING ACTIVITY IN ALL LINES OF BUSINESS OVER A CONSIDERABLE PERIOD REAL ESTATE SEEMS ALWAYS TO BE LAST TO FEEL THE INFLUENCE OF SUCH A GENERAL MOVEMENT IT IS EQUALLY SLOW TO RESPONL TO THE CHANGE DOWNWARD IN ACTIVITY THE REASONS ARE NOT DIFFICULT133 THE BUILDING COMPLEX TO FIND A NEW HOME OR A NEW OR ADDI TIONAL BUSINESS STRUCTURE IS A CONSE QUENCE OF PROSPERITYOF THE CAPACITY TO PAY FOR IT DWELLINGS WHETHER DETACHED OR IN APARTMENTS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO SUDDEN CHANGES THEY ARE OCCUPIED BY THE OWNERS OR ARE UNDER LEASE AND CHANGES OF OCCUPANCY ARE INFREQUENT A CHANGE IN BUSINESS CON DITIONS MUST BE OF SOME DURATION BEFORE ITS INFLUENCE IS EXERTED TO AFFECT A POSITION SO PERMANENT ONCE A NEW ADJUSTMENT HAS BEEN MADE HOWEVER A SIMILAR DEGREE OF PERMA NENCY HALTS THE CHANGE A LAG IN BUILD ING CONSTRUCTION PARTICULARLY OF HOMES MIGHT BE EXPECTED FOR THESE REASONS BUT THE REGULAR PROCESSION OF ECONOMIC DEPRESSION IS LOWERING OF PRICES SLOWING UP IN VOLUME OF PRODUCTION AND CONSE QUENT REDUCTION IN THE AMOUNT OF CAPI TAL NEEDED THIS BRINGS A FALL IN INTER EST RATES THERE IS EVERY REASON FOR BELIEVING THAT THIS IS NOW IN PROCESS AND PRESENTLY INTEREST RATES WILL BE WITHIN REACH OF THE HOME BUILDER MOREOVER CAPITAL IN TIMES OF DEPRESSION BECOMES TIMID AND REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES ARE THE RECOURSE OF THE TIMID INVESTOR LOCALIZED CONGESTION AND HIGH RENTS WILL YIELD SLOWLY STUDY OF THE WHEELER TABLES SEEMS TO SHOW THAT THE ACCUMULATED SHORTAGE OF BUILDINGS IS NOT EVERYWHERE SO SERIOUS AS IN SOME PARTICULAR PLACES IF THE HOOVER STATEMENT IS CORRECT AND THERE HAS BEEN AN INCREASE OF ONLY SEVEN FAMILIES FOR EACH HUNDRED DWELL INGS NEITHER MORALS NOR HEALTH ARE IN SERIOUS JEOPARDY THE INCREASE OF SEVEN FAMILIES IS HOWEVER NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED THAT AVERAGE MEANS A MENACING AND INTOLERABLE CONGESTION AT MANY POINTS WITH INCAPACITY TO PAY AS THE CAUSE AND AN ANNOYING CON GESTION AT OTHER POINTS WITH THE DESIRE OF MANY PEOPLE TO LIVE IN THE SAME SEC TION OR NEIGHBORHOOD AS THE CAUSE THIS IS A COMMON AMERICAN TRAIT COM PARABLE TO THE COMMON DESIRE TO RIDE ON THE SAME TRAIN OR BOAT OR STREET CAR ON WHICH EVERYONE ELSE ALSO DESIRES TO RIDE IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE ACCUMU LATED SHORTAGE IN DETROIT AND CLEVE LAND CANNOT BE SERIOUS IN TERMS OF PRESENT DAY CONDITIONS OF PRICES AND THE NECESSITY FOR NATIONAL ECONOMY BUT THE SHORTAGE IS EVERYWHERE SERIOUS IN VIEW OF THE INCREASE OF RENTS UNTIL THE POINT OF SATURATION OF THE BUILDING MARKET IS REACHED RENTS WILL YIELD SLOWLY AND RENTS ARE TOO HIGH THE RETURN ON NEW BUILDING INVESTMENTS IS HIGH AND THE RETURN ON OLD ONES IS OUT OF ALL PROPORTION TO A FAIR PROFIT THE RENTAL YIELD IS ALSO OUT OF PROPORTION TO THE RETURN ON OTHER INVESTMENTS UNDER OTHER LESS TRYING CONDITIONS THIS SHOULD DRAW FUNDS TOWARD BUILDING AND ULTIMATELY WORK TOWARD THE NEW LEVEL BUT PRICES AND CONDITIONS IN BUILDING HAVE NOT YET BEEN ADJUSTED TO PERMIT MORE THAN A SMALL BEGINNING THERE ARE OTHER FACTORS AT WORK THE MOVEMENT CITYWARD SO PRONOUNCED WHEN FACTORIES WERE CRYING FOR LABOR AT HIGH WAGES HAS BEEN STOPPED OR REVERSED WHEN AUTOMOBILE PRODUC TION WAS AT ITS PEAK IN DETROIT IN 1919 1920 THERE WERE MORE THAN 20000 DESERTED FARMS IN MICHIGAN THE MIGRATION OF NEGROES FROM THE SOUTH TO NORTHERN CITIES CAUSED GREAT DIS TURBANCE IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS OF THE LATTER MANY OF THE NEGROES HAVE RETURNED TO THEIR FORMER ABODES FOR RENT SIGNS BEGAN TO REAPPEAR MONTHS AGO IN MANY CITIES THERE HAS APPEARED A TENDENCY FOR CONDITIONS TO RIGHT THEMSELVES SO FAR AS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE ORDINARY AMOUNT OF BUILD ING IN THIS RESPECT THEN AT THIS TIME BUILDING IS IN THE SAME POSITION AS EVERYTHING ELSE THE DESIRE OF ALL BUSI NESS MEN IS TO DO BUSINESS THE DIS COVERY OF A REMEDY TO AID OR HASTEN THETHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY WORK OF ORDINARY ECONOMIC FORCES IS THEN IMPORTANT THIS IS THE PROBLEM TO WHICH CONGRESS THE ADMINISTRATION AND INNUMERABLE ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE ADDRESSED THEMSELVES BUILDING NOSTRUMS AS THE CAUSES FOR BUILDING INERTIA CONSEQUENT ON THE WAR DISAPPEAR AND BUILDING IS NOT RESUMED OR IS RESUMED VERY SLOWLY NEW CAUSES ARE ASSIGNED THESE CAUSES VARY ACCORDING TO THE WHIMS OR PREDILECTIONS OF THEIR PRO PONENTS BEFORE THE NATIONAL CONVENTION OF REAL ESTATE MEN IN CHICAGO IN JULY SENATOR CALDER GAVE FINAL AND PARTICU LAR STRESS TO THE LACK OF CREDITTO THE UNWILLINGNESS OF BANKERS TO MAKE ADVANCES FOR BUILDING PURPOSES HE ABANDONED COAL AND RAILROAD RATES AND OTHER CAUSES PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED SCANT ATTENTION WAS GIVEN TO THE REPORTS OF THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEES IN NEW YORK OR THE PROCEEDINGS IN CHICAGO THE INFLUENCE OF ILLEGAL COMBINATIONS OF BUILDERS PRICE FIXING COLLUSIVE BIDDING AND DISTRIBUTION OF CONTRACTS AND OTHER DARK METHODS WAS LARGELY IGNORED LABOR GUILTY OF A VERY SIMILAR POLICY ON THE PART OF ITS LEADERS WAS GIVEN A POSITION OF LESS INFLUENCE ON BUILDING THAN THAT OF THE BANKERS AS IS CUSTOMARY IN SUCH CASES THE REMEDY FOR THIS DERELICTION ON THE PART OF THE BANKERS WAS AN AMENDMENT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM IS THE PORT OF CALL OF ALL FINANCIAL SHIPS IN DISTRESS SENATOR CALDERS DISCOVERY THAT NATIONAL BANKS HAVE TWO BILLIONS IN SAVINGS DEPOSITS OF WHICH ONLY EIGHT PER CENT IS INVESTED IN REAL ESTATE MORTGAGES IS THE FOUNDATION ON WHICH HE BASES HIS PLEA FOR AN AMEND MENT TO THE RESERVE ACT GIVING THE RESERVE BOARD POWER TO AUTHORIZE THE INVESTMENT OF THE SAVINGS DEPOSITS OF NATIONALBANKS INLONGTERM SECURITIES THE ALLEGATION THAT THE BANKS HAVE NOT BEEN MAKING REAL ESTATE LOANS IS TRUE IN LARGE MEASURE MONEY HAS BEEN NEITHER PLENTIFUL NOR CHEAP FOR A LONG TIME BUT BANKERS WHO HAVE CUS TOMARILY MADE LOANS ON REAL ESTATE SECURITY HAVE NOT BEEN REFUSING LOANS IN MANY LARGE CITIES MONEY HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR BUILDING IT MAY BE MEN TIONED THAT IN CHICAGO SEVERAL BANKS HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING FOR SOME MONTHS THAT THEY LHAD FUNDS FOR THAT FORM OF INVESTMENT SIMILARLY THERE HAS BEEN CONSTANT ADVERTISEMENT BOTH IN NEW YORK AND CHICAGO OF BONDS SECURED BY REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE UNDOUBTEDLY THE BANKS SO ADVERTISING MAKE ONLY CONSERVATIVE LOANS AND ARE NOT INTER ESTED TO LEND FOR CONSTRUCTION PURPOSES ON A BASIS OF REPAYMENT IN INSTALL MENTS LIKE RENT HOWEVER A FIRST HAND INVESTIGATION DISCLOSED THAT EVEN WHEN THE OUTCRY AGAINST HIGH RENTS WAS SHRILLEST THE DEMAND FOR REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE LOANS ON TERMS THAT MET THE REQUIREMENTS OF CONVENTIONAL SAFETY WAS SMALL ONE LARGE CHICAGO BANK REPORTED TWO APPLI CATIONS FOR SUCH LOANS IN SEVEN MONTHS AND MADE BOTH THERE WAS AT THE SAME TIME FROM ITS CUSTOMERS A DEMAND FOR MORTGAGES AS INVESTMENTS WHICH COULD NOT BE SATISFIED SIMILAR REPORTS CAME FROM OTHER INSTITUTIONS AND FROM OTHER CITIES ON THE OTHER HAND IT WAS POSSIBLE TO FIND HUNDREDS OF PERSONS WHO NOT ONLY WISHED TO BUILD BUT WERE WAITING FOR BETTER PRICES AND MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS ARCHITECTS EVERYWHERE HAD PENDING ORDERS IN THE AGGREGATE THERE WERE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOL LARS WAITING UNTIL PRICES AND CONDITIONS WERE FAVORABLE THESE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS ARE STILL WAITING THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT A CUREALL IT REMAINS ONLY TO DISCUSS THE PROB ABLE INFLUENCE OF THE PROPOSED AMEND 134THE BUILDING COMPLEX MENT TO THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT ON BUILDING AND OTHERWISE THE PRESENT LAW PERMITS NATIONAL BANKS TO LEND A PART OF THEIR TIME OR SAVINGS DEPOSITS ON FARM MORTGAGES OR ON REAL ESTATE THAT PROVISION OF THE LAW WAS ACCEDED TO BY ITS FRAMERS WITH GREAT RELUCTANCE ITS SUPPORTERS WERE ARDENT IN THEIR CLAIMS THAT SUCH A PROVISION WOULD BE MOST HELPFUL TO THOSE DESIRING TO BUILD OR BUY HOMES ITS EFFECT HAS BEEN NEGLIGIBLE THEORETICALLY AT LEAST THE NATIONAL BANKS ARE COMMERCIAL BANKS THEIR MANAGERS ARE NOT FAMILIAR WITH REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE TECHNIQUE A COMMERCIAL BANKER HAS AN HABITUAL HORROR OF MORTGAGES PROBABLY HE SHOULD HAVE WORSE EVEN THAN HIGH RENTS OR A SHORTAGE OF HOMES WOULD BE AN INVA SION OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE COMMERCIAL BANKING SYSTEM LOANS ON FARM OR REAL ESTATE MORTGAGE SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IN THE FEDERAL RESERVE ACT TO BROADEN THE APPLICATION OF THE EXISTING PROVISION IS FRAUGHT WITH DANGER THE ERROR OF PERMITTING NA TIONAL BANKS TO DO A SAVINGS BUSINESS IS BECOMING APPARENT THE ABOLITION OF THAT PRIVILEGE WOULD BE A MORE PERTI NENT RECOMMENDATION THAN PERMISSIVE OR COMPULSORY LOANING OF THE SAVINGS DEPOSITS IN LARGE PROPORTION ON LAND MORTGAGES CREDIT ONLY ONE ELEMENT IN A COMPLEX SITUATION IT IS DOUBTFUL IF EASY CREDIT WOULD PROVE A STIMULANT TO BUILDING SO LONG AS OTHER CONDITIONS REMAIN AS THEY ARE INTEREST RATES HAVE BEEN HIGH FOR MANY REASONS AMERICANS HAVE BEEN FORCED TO BID AGAINST A NEEDY EUROPE FOR FUNDS TAXATION HAS RUN UP THE RETURNS DE MANDED BY INVESTORS A SHRINKING DOLLAR INCREASED THE DEMNAND FOR CAPITAL JUST AS AN EXPANDING DOLLAR WILL DIMIN ISH SUCH DEMAND BUILDING ENTERPRISE HAS BEEN OUTBID IN THE MONEY MARKET BY INDUSTRIAL ENTERPRISE WILLING TO PAY SEVEN TO EIGHT PER CENT FOR CAPITAL WHEN OTHER CONDITIONS HAVE RIGHTED THESELVES THERE WILL BE CREDIT FOR BUILDING OTHER CONDITIONS MAY RIGHT THEMSELVES PARTLY AS THE RESULT OF NEW LAWS OR AMENDMENTS OF OLD LAWS BUT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAT CHANGES WILL RESULT FROM THE RETURN TO MORE NORMAL SOCIAL AND BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS IT IS TO BE EXPECTED THAT THERE WILL BE STILL MORE SUGGESTIONS AND STILL MORE DISCLOSURES OF HIDDEN FORCES WORKING FOR HIGH WAGES AND PRICES BUT IN THE END WHEN TIME HAS BROUGHT THE FORESEEABLE READJUST MENTS IT WILL BE FOUND THAT BUILDING HAS BEEN SUBJECTED ONLY TO THE COMMON INFLUENCES THAT ATTENDED WAR PLUS PERHAPS AN UNUSUAL DEGREE OF HUMAN CHICANERY 135

j100168,Harvard Law Review,1325419,Carriers Limitation of Liability Breach of Condition Precedent as Affecting Exemption,i256934,HARVARD LAW REVIEW bears Held that the rule imposing absolute liability on the keeper of ani mals ferae naturae does not apply to the defendant Molloy v Starin I9I N Y 21 If carriers were required to receive dangerous animals they should not be under absolute liability for damage since it seems unjust to impose an insurers duty upon one who must assume a burden already perilous Cf Jackson v Baker 24 D C App Cas Ioo It is settled however that carriers may refuse to accept freight of a dangerous character Cal Powder Works v A 6 P R R Co 1I3 Cal 329 The transportation of animals ferae naturae and of explosives is often necessary and imposing absolute liability would act as an undesirable deterrent on carriers Responsibility irrespective of negligence seems to have been imposed originally from a feeling that the keeping of such things was improper and was in itself an offense Muller v McKesson 73 N Y I95 Mere temporary possession was sufficient and carriers or bailees for any purpose have been charged regardless of caution Marsel v Bowman 62 Ia 57 The Lord Derby 17 Fed 265 The reasoning of the present decision however would relieve from liability many keepers for limited purposes and in this seems justifiable for public opinion no longer requires discrimination against keepers of ferocious beasts Cf Marquet v LaDuke 96 Mich 596 Furthermore the result accords with the trend of modern American authority to do away with absolute liability in the use of land and of explosives Brown v Collins 53 N H 442 Sowers v McManus 214 Pa St 244 CARRIERS  DISCRIMINATION  DISTRIBUTION OF CARS  In computing the distribution of its cars in a time of shortage the defendant railroad failed to count the fuel cars sent to certain mines by foreign railroads to be filled for them Held that such fuel cars must be counted in determining the quota to be allotted each shipper R R Corn of Ohio v The Hocking Valley Ry Co 12 Interst C Rep 466 Under the Interstate Commerce Act coal carriers must distribute their cars in proportion to the capacity of the mines of the district United States v W Va Northern R Co 125 Fed 252 25 STAT AT L 855 The method by which such quotas should be determined was considered in two recent cases United States v B 6 O R Co 154 Fed Ic8 Logan Coal Co v Penn R Co 154 Fed 497 In both it was held that cars provided by a shipper should be counted as part of such shippers quota on the ground that the transportation of such cars occupied the railroad to the detriment of other shippers Since it is the duty of the carrier to furnish vehicles of transportation it is bound to subject a shipper who does not supply vehicles to no disadvantage Rice Robinson and Winthrop v Western N Y  P R Co 3 Interst C Rep I62 In one case the principle was not applied to foreign fuel cars United States v B 6 0 R Co supra But the other case supports the present ruling Logan Coal Co v Penn R Co supra It is difficult to see any ground for making a distinction between the fuel cars and the individual cars Under any other rule than that of the present case the carrier would be discriminating in favor of the mines to which fuel cars were sent CARRIERSLIMITATION OF LIABILITYBREACH OF CONDITION PRE CEDENT AS AFFECTING EXEMPTION  A ship having collided while docking water entered and damaged the cargo between decks and then owing to a defect in the ship continued into the hold and there damaged other goods The charterparty exempted the owner from liability for accidents in docking Held that the charterer may recover only the damage due to the unseaworthi ness The Europa 1908 P 84 This decision appears to go on the ground that the charterer having received substantial performance can now no longer treat the unseaworthiness as a breach of condition precedent The court distinguishes a recent English case in which deviation though assumed not to be the cause of the damage was held to be such a breach of condition precedent as to deprive the shipowners of the contract exemption from liability Thorley Ltd v Orchis S S Co Ltd 1907 I K B 660 see 20 HARV L REV 325 But in that case the deviation 442RECENT CASES was in fact a possible cause of the damage It has not therefore yet been held that breach of a condition precedent avoids the express limitations of liability when the damage would have occurred if the condition had not been broken CHATTEL MORTGAGES  AFTER ACQUIRED PROPERTY  RIGHT TO OFF SPRING OF MORTGAGED ANIMALS  The plaintiff claimed that a chattel mortgage of certain cows included the calves in gestation at the time the mort gage was executed there being no reference in the mortgage to the increase Held that the mortgage gives only a lien which does not attach to the calves Demers v Graham 93 Pac 268 Mont The general rule is that a chattel mortgagee has title and so a mortgage on animals covers the increase though not mentioned in the mortgage on the principle partus sequitur ventrem See 16 HARV L REV 442 This rule weakens the effect of the recording laws since an examination of the mortgage gives no actual notice of its extent But in the few states where by statute or decision a chattel mortgage gives only a lien it is often possible to change a result based on the mortgagees title Thus contrary to the result in states passing title to the mortgagee a tender of the amount due on a note though made after maturity discharges the lien on the chattel mortgage security Moore v Norman 43 Minn 428 cf Noyes v Wyckoff 30 Hun N Y 466 So too the court is free to construe the lien as limited to the property actually described The contrary view is a possible construction First Natl Bank v Western Mtge etc Co 86 Tex 636 Thus a pledge is said to cover the in crease See JONES PLEDGES  32 The view of the present case however is preferable as it carries out the spirit of the registry laws Shoobert v De Motta 112 Cal 215 CONFLICT OF LAWS  LEGITIMACY AND ADOPTION  LEGITIMATION SUB SEQUENT TO BIRTH A New York man deserted his wife and purported to marry a New Jersey woman who bore him two children Thereafter he be came domiciled with his family in Michigan obtained a divorce there from his New York wife by default without personal service and went through a second marriage ceremony with the New Jersey woman This divorce and remarriage a New York court by decree refused to recognize By Michigan law illegiti mate children become legitimate by the subsequent marriage of their parents The children claimed New York realty under a devise as the lawful issue  of their father Held that they are not entitled to the property Ohnsted v Olnsted I90 N Y 458 For a criticism of this case in the lower court see 20 HARV L REV 400 CONSIDERATION  THEORIES OF CONSIDERATION  ACCORD AND SAT ISFACTION BY PART PAYMENT  The plaintiff in a suit for the balance of a note admitted that several partial payments had been made by the defendant It was inferable that the defendant was insolvent when the last partial payment was made and possible that she had consented to the sale of certain land Held that it was error to charge that an agreement to accept the payments in full satisfaction is no defense Frye v Hubbell 68 Atl 325 N H Although this case may not squarely involve the doctrine formerly established in New Hampshire that an accord and satisfaction by payment of less than the whole debt is not valid yet it is certainly intended to annul that doctrine and does not rest on any exception to be made on account of the insolvency of the debtor Reliance is placed upon the general reluctant expressions of assent to the overruled doctrine and upon the argument of Professor Ames that it is un just and arose in England through a misunderstanding See Foakes v Beer 9 App Cas 605 I2 HARV L REV 515 13 ibid 29 The various views of the nature of consideration are discussed in 8 HARV L REV 27 14 ibid 496 I7 ibid 7I CONSTITUTIONAL LAW  CLASS LEGISLATION  ACT ALLOWING PRIVATE CLAIM AGAINST STATE  Article III  19 of the Constitution of New York

Williams v Delaware and Hudson Co App Div 1913 141 N Y Supp 606 The prevailing view taken by the U S Supreme Court and many state courts following a similar English adjudication is that since the issuance of a bill of lading by an agent who has not received the goods specified therein is totally unauthorized the act is not binding on the principal Friedlander v Texas By 1889 130 UJ S 416 Lazard v Merchants and Miners Co 1893 78 Md 1 Grant v Norway 1851 10 0 B 665 Although everyone knows of this limit ation upon the agents authority see Natl Bank7 of Commerce v Chicago Ry 1890 44 Minn 224 233 no third person save perhaps the consignor can ascertain the existence of the fact upon which the agents authority is conditioned Bank of Batavia v N Y R R 1887 106 N Y 195 Since the principal must have realized this and since he has necessarily directed the agent to assert whether or not such fact exists see Credit Co v Howe Co 1886 54 Oonn 357 387 there is some justification for allowing the agents representa tion to estop the principal Cf St Louis R R v Lamed 1882 103 Dl 293 Brooke v N  F R R 1885 108 Pa 529 Moreover inasmuch as the third person can secure no information from the principal and must accept the recital of the bill of lading if he is to do business at all there is not that consent to his own injury which ordinarily confronts a person who has chosen to contract with an agent without ascertaining his authority The New York rule Armour v Michigan R R 1875 65 N Y 111 which invokes an estoppel in such a case commends itself as the more expedient see Williston Sales 719 and is now fortified by statute see New York Per Prop Law  209 which imposes the same qualification as the principal case that in order to avail oneself of the rule it is essen tial that one should have relied upon the representation BANKRUPTCYINSURANCERIGHT OF TRUSTEE IN LIFE POLICIES OF BANKRUPTThe insured assigned to a firm of which he was a mem ber policies on his life payable to his personal representatives The policies were later assigned by the firm to the insurer as security for a loan equal to their cash surrender value and within two months of the filing of an involuntary petition in bankruptcy against the partnership the policies were again assigned by it to the de fendant subject to the first assignment The insured died following the appointment of the trustees and the latter brought suit against the defendant for the amount realized from the policies attacking the second assignment as preferential Held recovery should be de nied Burlingham v Crouse 1913 228 U S

mortgage is required by law as in the jurisdiction of the principal case 1909 Rev Stat of MIo  2861 and such an instrument is recorded within four months of the bankruptcy it will constitute a voidable preference no matter when the mortgage was executed In re Beckhaus C C A 1910 177 Fed 141 under the amendment of 1903 to  60a U S Bank Act 1898 referring such transactions to the date of

against the amount of the check informed the drawee not to honor it Held one judge dissenting the payee cannot recover on the certification Carnegie Trust Co v First Nat Bank 1913 141 N Y Supp 745 A failure to distinguish between certification at the request of the drawer and certification at the request of the holder has led courts into the error of holding that if a certification is made by mistake it is at all times revocable in the absence of an estoppel Irving Bank v Wetherald 1867 36 N Y 335 Second Nat Bank of Baltimore v Western Nat Bank 1878 51 Md 128 In the first case certifica tion is made by the bank to facilitate the drawers negotiation of the check it is only a representation that the drawers signature is genuine and that he has a sufficient deposit with the drawee which will be set aside for the payment of the check Therefore where the certification has been made by mistake the bank may recall it if the rights of third parties have not intervened But certification at the request of the payee at common law and under the Negotiable Instruments Act releases the drawer Continental Nat Bank v Corn hauser 1890 37 Ill App 475 cf Davenport v Palmer 1912 137 N Y Supp 796

Negotiable Instru ments Law the plaintiff took subject to the defenses available against the bank MlcCarty v Kepreta N Dak 1913 139 N W 992 Unlike the imputation to a corporation of the knowledge of its officers see 9 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 730 the imputation to individuals in a private capacity of knowledge which they are presumed to have in a corporate capacity is not governed by a definite rule Although the presumption of knowledge in a director is in reality a substantive rule of liability notwithstanding lack of knowledge cf Wigmore Evi dence  2492 some courts have been inclined to hold it as effective against him in a private capacity see Lyman v Bank of the U S 1851 12 How 225 Merchants Bank v Rudolf 1877 5 Neb 527 Gillet v Phillips 1855 13 N Y 114 Morse Banks  Banking  137 as actual knowledge acquired officially would be Lancaster v Collins 1881 7 Fed 338 Undoubtedly the belief that any other holding would open the way to fraud especially in banking institutions has influenced these decisions But while the presumption of knowledge is very properly enforced against a director or other officer to a full liability in his official capacity Savings Bank v Wulfekuhler 1877 19 Kan 60 the better view would seem to be that the presumption conclusive in a corporate capacity In re NewcastleuponTyne Marine Ins Co 1854 19 Beav 97 should be rebuttable when applied to circumstances involving only a private capacity Proctor v Baldwin 1882 82 Ind 370 cf Iowa Nat Bank v Sherman 1903 17 S Dak 396 The principal case therefore while in accord with the trend of authority before the Act

Hawkins P 0 414 Ran dell v Evening News Assn 1893 97 Mich 136 but with this excep tion the amount of value is immaterial Watson v State 1883 39 Oh St 123 A promissory note which is unenforcible

itself a thing of value State v Walls 1876 54 Ind 561 but see Commonwealth v Donovan 1898 170 Mass 228 On proof that a benefit to a third party was also a benefit to him who requested the act there would be no hesitation in convicting see State ex rel Church v Dustin 1875 5 Ore 375 and an inference to this effect drawn from the mere fact of the request is sufficient to justify a magistrates holding the accused for the grand jury People ex rel Dickinson v Van de Carr supra Such an inference however will not suffice to make out a case of bribery for the purpose of removing an officer People ex rel Church v Dustin supra but see State ex rel Newell v Purdy 1874 36 Wis 213 and clearly cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt in order to sustain a conviction CRIMINAL LAWSTARE DECISSThe defendant in answering a bill demanding the forfeiture of its charter because of its violation of a criminal statute which had already been declared valid by the court set up the unconstitutionality of the statute as a defense Held the defense was good State ex rel Pitts v Nashville Baseball Club Tenn 1913 154 S W 1151 643COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW The value of the doctrine of stare decisis in securing the stability so necessary to a successful administration of law has long been recog nized Cooley Constitutional Limitations 7th ed 88 Wilkins v St Louis B R 1903 110 Tenn 422 It rests however primarily on reasons of public policy see Mason v Cotton Co 1908 148 N 0 492 Willis v Owen 1875 43 Tex 41 and consequently should not be invoked to subvert public interest Hence the courts have not hesitated to overrule a clearly erroneous decision when no property rights were to be affected by their action Paul v Davis 1884 100 Ind 422 Black Law of Judicial Precedents 199 This view would seem particularly applicable to criminal law 1 Bishop New Criminal Law 8th ed  9498 although when the error in the former decision was to the defendants advantage the propriety of overruling it and thus giving the decision an ex post facto color has been denied People v Tompkins 1906 186 3N Y 413 This view is doubtless sound when crimes mala prohibita are the subject of the decisions but it is at least an open question in respect to crimes mala in se in view of the argument that an individual should not by reason of the moral turpitude involved in his conduct be given a vested right in an erroneous decision Lanier v State 1879 57 Miss 102 see State v Williams 1880 13 S 0 546 contra People v Tompkins supra When however the reversal is to the defendants advantage as in the principal case even the ex post facto argument does not apply and the injustice of allowing the erroneous decision to stand can scarcely be open to doubt CRIMINAL LAWvVENUEDECREE OF PROOFThe trial judge in a criminal prosecution failed to charge the jury that venue must be proved and what quantum of proof was necessary Held that a pre ponderance of evidence is sufficient to prove venue Norris v State Tenn 1913 155 S W 165 Many courts have taken the view that the averment that the crime had been committed in the county or district in which the defendant was tried must like every other material allegation of an indictment be proved beyond a reasonable doubt Davis v State 1908 134 Wis 632 State v Keeland 1909 39 Mont 506 Wade v State 1912 11 Ga App 411 This rule has been carried in one state to such an extreme that the court refuses to take judicial notice of the location of towns within the county See Wade v State supra While it is of the very essence of the defendants guilt that the crime charged should have been committed within the state which by law declares it a crime Story Conflict of Laws 8th ed  620 see People v Martin N Y 1902 38 Misc 67 the venue is separate and distinct from the determination of his guilt Brunson v State 1910 4 Okla Grim 467 and need be established solely for the purpose of showing the jurisdiction of the particular court Warrace v State

of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt 1 Wharton Crim inal Evidence 10th ed  1 but see 4 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 356 obviously do not apply to the proof of the courts jurisdiction See Wilson v State 1896 62 Ark 497 No injustice therefore can be done the defendant in a criminal prosecution any more than in a civil action by allowing proof of jurisdiction by a preponderance of 644RECENT DECISIONS evidence

CHnMDThe plaintiff deserted her husband taking their minor child with her She brings this action to recover the money expended to support the child sub sequent to the divorce granted to the husband on the grounds of de sertion in which no disposition was made of the child Held that since the financial means of the husband were so much greater than the plaintiffs she could recover White v White Mo 1913 154 S W 872 The primary obligation to support children rests upon the father Young v Young 1907 28 Oh Circ Ct 179 Correlative to this duty however is the right to the society and services of the child Burritt v Burritt N Y 1859 29 Barb 124 The father need support his children only in the home which he has furnished Hyde v Leisenring 1895 107 Mich 490 and when a wife deserts that home taking her infant child with her the law implies no promise to pay for the support unless the child has been abandoned by the father Ramsey v Ramsey 1889 121 Ind 215 In paying for the maintenance she has only discharged a duty which she has voluntarily assumed by taking the child into her custody Christoff v Christoff 1892 6 Oh Circ Ct 512 and the fathers failure to demand the custody raises no implication in favor of the plaintiff Baldwin v Foster 1885 138 Mass 449 Glynn v Glynn 1900 94 Me 465 A subsequent divorce does not of itself in any way affect the question Fitler v Fitler 1859 33 Pa

1887 45 Oh St 452 To allow a recovery by the wife on the grounds of benefit to the child as in the principal case seems to confuse the issues since the question is not the future disposition of the child but reimbursement for benefits already conferred See Fulton v Fulton 1895 52 Oh St 229 235 FRAUDRIGHT OF ACTION AFTER ASSIGNMENT OF CONTRACT RIGHTS The plaintiff entered into a contract for the purchase of certain real estate from the defendant and then assigned his interest therein to his wife After performance of the contract the plaintiff discovered misrepresentations and brought suit for damages Held two judges dissenting the action could be maintained Fox v Hirschfield N Y 1913 157 App Div 264 The right to assign a chose in action which was not sanctioned under the early common law has been today generally accorded by statute see 12 COLUMBA LAW REIEmw 460 and as the intention of the parties is allowed to prevail an assignment may be implied from the circumstances surrounding a transaction Comeggs v Vasse 1824 1 Pet 193 In some jurisdictions all rights of action for torts are assignable Gray v McAllister 1872 50 Ia 497 although the more generally accepted rule limits assignability of tort actions to those for injury to property Bennett v Woolfolk N Y 1894 80 Hun 390 It would seem that a cause of action at law for damages for fraud resulting in a property loss was such a tort see Dahms v Sears 1885 13 Ore 47 but some courts influenced by the fact that the circum 645COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW stances giving rise to the action at law often give an election to file a bill in equity to set aside the transaction and that the mere right to file a bill in equity for fraud is not assignable Posser v Edmonds 1835 1 Younge  Collyer 481 have held that no right of action for fraud can be assigned Smith v Thompson 1892 94 Mich 381 In New York however the rule appears to be that the cause of action at law is assignable independently of other rights Graves v Shiel N Y 1870 58 Barb 349 On the other hand there is no doubt this remedy would not pass as an incident to a transfer of the specific property Kennedy v Benson CC 1893 54 Fed 836 Tyson v Ranney 1895 89 Wis 518

1880 6 Lea 508 Where however statutes have freed the wifes choses in action from her husbands interference it would seem that the rights of the parties should be governed entirely by inten tion In

sole control of her property she 646RECENT DECISIONS had the right to exclude her husband from her home State v in clair Mo 1913 157 S W 339 The development of the modern independent position of woman and her emancipation from the rigorous restrictions of the old com mon law has been marked in all the United States by statutes which seem peculiarly adaptable to divergent interpretations and lacking as it does the coordinating influence of common law principle the result is a chaotic variety of decisions See Ball v Paquin 1905 140 N 0 83 Since the control which the husband exercised over the person of his wife has been almost entirely abrogated Queen v Jackson L R 1891 1 Q B D 671 his right to enter her home would appear to depend upon his rights in her property If the wifes property is under the husbands management see Brown v Brown 1884 61 Tex 56 or if it is merely relieved from liability for his debts Schindel v Schindel 1858 12 Md 294 it would seem that his right of ingress and egress was preserved as an incident to his marital rights State v Jones 1903 132 N 0 1043 and would not be for feited by his merely living apart See Love v Moynehan 1855 16 1 277 Where however it is held that a married woman is suffi ciently independent to have a separate domicile Shute v Sargent 1892 67 N H 305 and to contract respecting her separate estate as reely as though unmarried Rice Stix  Co v Sally 1903 176 lMo 107 it would appear to be but a logical step that whatever tenancy a husband might have in his wifes home see Rowe v Kel logg 1884 54 Mich 206 could be terminated at her will Cook v Cook 1899 125 Ala 583 Nevertheless in behalf of domestic sta bility see Manning v Manning 1878 79 N 0 293 there seems to be some justification for holding that it was not the intent of the legislature that such a power should be granted either to the husband or to the wife Walker v Reamy 1860 36 Pa 410 INJUNCTIONSSCONTINUING NUISANCESBALANCOIN LNJURIESThe de fendant company which owned

recovery should be granted Duffy v Bankers Life Assn Iowa 1913 139 N W 1087 It is well settled that no contract of insurance is created by the failure of an insurance company to reject an application for a policy within a reasonable time More v N Y Bowery Fire Ins Co 1892 130 N Y 537 The doctrine that the company may none the less be liable in tort for such a delay is new and was first adopted in Boyer v Hail Ins Co 1912 86 Kan 442 although its correctness seems 647COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW to have been suggested in Walker v Farmers Ins Co 1879 51 Iowa 679 It rests on the theory that an insurance company assumes with its charter a legal duty either to grant insurance to an appli cant within a reasonable time or to inform him of its refusal and give him an opportunity to apply elsewhere a theory which is in line with the modern tendency in legislation to treat insurance com panies as quasipublic service corporations because of their great social importance Ohio Code of 1910  615673 93399409 Gephart Insurance and the State Chap II A practical argument is based on the fact that insurance companies customarily require a deposit to be made with the application and ordinarily date the policy as of the same day on which the application was signed It is urged that the company owes a legal duty not to prolong unnecessarily this period for which it is exacting a premium without incurring any risk Once we admit this duty of the insurance company it is obvious that it is liable for the negligence of any agent in failing to send in an application which he was empowered to receive JUDICIAL SALESCONFIRMIATIONINADEQUACY OF PRICEThe com plainant objected to the confirmation of an execution sale of mort gaged property on the ground that the property went for an inade quate price Held objection overruled Knickerbocker Trust Co v Carteret Steel Co N J Eq 1912 86 Atl 55 Because of its power to control its own judgments it lies within the discretion of a court to set aside judicial sales at the instance of any person who has been injured thereby Goodell v Harrington 1879 76 N Y 547 In England a judicial sale will be set aside before confirmation upon the offer of a sufficient advance over the sum received Wiltsie Mortgage Foreclosures 3rd ed  626 In re Joness Settled Estates 1860 29 L J N s Ch 139 but see Bal lentyne v Smith 1907 205 U S 285 But the prevailing view in the United States is that in the absence of fraud or irregularities mere inadequacy of price will not justify a court in setting aside a judicial sale unless the inadequacy is so great as to shock the con science Ballentyne v Smith supra Abbott v Beebe 1907 226 Ill 417 The theory is that a grossly inadequate price betokens fraud which is always a sufficient ground to justify a court in setting aside a sale Pomeroy Equity Jurisprudence  927 At times courts have ignored this rule and held that no price is inadequate OCallaghan v OCallaghan 1878 91 Ill 228 But most courts either apply the rule Lank ford v Jackson 1852 21 Ala 650 James v Nease Texas 1902 69 S W 110 or in cases of great inadequacy they are quick to seize on other circumstances impeaching the fairness of the transac tion as a pretext for setting aside the sale Schroeder v Young 1895 161 U S 334 ODonnell v Lindsay N Y 1873 7 Jones  Spencer 523 LANDLORD AND TENANTCOVENANT FOR EXTENSIONHOLDING OVER The lessee under

v Marshall Creamery Co 1902 118 Ia 595 cf Kollock v Scribner 1897 98 Wis 104 If however a higher rental is provided for by the lease Long v Stafford 1886 103 N Y 274 see Stone v St Louis Stamping Co 1892 155 Mass 267 or if the tenant gives notice after the appointed period Sheppard v Rosenkraus 1901 109 Wis 58 there is no difficulty in treating a holding over with the payment and acceptance of the appropriate rent as a renewal But if there be a covenant for an extension rather than for a renewal of the term a mere holding over is deemed a sufficient indication of the tenants exercise of his privilege See Terstegge v First German Mut Benev Soc 1883 92 Ind 82 So farreaching is this presumption of law that it is often employed to override an express stipulation of notice Probst v Rochester Steam Laundry Co 1902 171 N Y 584 Hotel Allen Co v Estate of Allen 1912 117 Minn 333 But on the theory that the terms of the option indicate how the lessee may avail himself thereof other authorities

injuries due to the breaking of a de fective ladder furnished by his master The trial court instructed the jury that if the servant had equal opportunity with the master to discover the defect in the ladder recovery should be denied Held the instruction was erroneous East Tennessee Telephone Co v Jeff ries Ky 1913 154 S W1112 The rule here repudiated was originally laid down in broad lan guage in cases where the appliances were simple and of such a char acter that the defects in them must have been obvious to the servant Priestley v Fowler 1837 3 IM  W 1 Nourse v Packard 1885 138 Mass 307 The

the master con tend that he should not be required to exercise more care on behalf of the servant than the servant does for himself Priestley v Fowler supra But since knowledge of the danger is an essential element of assumption of risk 12 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 629 it would seem that the mere fact that the servant had equal opportunity with his master to discover the danger would be immaterial in

states see Laws of Ark 1904 66589 which has regard only for the relative rank of the servant causing the injury and is never concerned with the character of the work he may be doing at that moment but

until the claim has been first presented Huntington v City of Calais 1909 105 Me 144 ODonnell v New London 1902 113 Wis 292 The courts have not generally been inclined to hold these provisions

QUESTION OF LAW In an action against a municipal corporation for an injury caused by slight defects in a sidewalk the lower court directed a verdict for the defendant Held the question of the defendants negligence should have gone to the jury Gibbs v Village of Girard Ohio 1913 102 N E 299 It has been frequently determined in American courts that a mu nicipality when acting in its private capacity is not an insurer but having the same status as a private corporation is only liable for failure to use due care Elliot Municipal Corporations 2nd ed  326 Beltz v City of Yonkers 1895 148 N Y

usually been regarded as a question of mixed law and fact Beven Negligence 3rd ed 131 Fuller v Citizens Nat Bank 1882 15 Fed 875 but the sufficiency of the plaintiffs evidence to justify a verdict for

doctrine in the law of municipal corporations as the principal case assumes which affords the basis for the decisions in which defects similar to those in the principal case were held not to con stitute negligence on the part of the municipality Witham v Port land 1881 72 Me 539 Grant v Enfield N Y 1896 11 App Div 358 The principal case is in conflict with these decisions therefore only in its adherence to the scintilla rule of evidence according to which the slightest particle of evidence in support of the plaintiffs case compels its submission to the jury Thompson Trials 2nd ed  2246

real defenses Crawford Negotiable Instruments 3rd ed 71 nb It would seem improbable however that the framers of the law intended to make that a contract which was void in its inception see Alexander v Hazelrigg 1906 123 Ky 677 and it is significant also that the section which is relied on to accomplish that result speaks only of defects of title Moreover if the holder in due course took free of all defenses it would seem unnecessary to impose the obligation of warranty upon an indorser by  66 In the jurisdiction of the principal case the preservation of real defenses is secured by a modification in the state statute Wis St 1911  167625 167627 Many courts however influenced rather by policy than by principle have disallowed the defense of intoxication in order to place the loss upon the party whom they consider at fault and to protect the free circulation of commercial paper State Bank v McCoy supra Smith v Williamson 1892 8 Utah 219 There is also a curious middle ground which allows the intoxication of the maker to prevent in effect the status of a holder in due course since it opens a note in the hands of any holder to the defense of fraud or lack of consideration without itself

alleged contributory negligence Held this was not an admission of negligence on the part of the defendant which would limit the issues to that of the plaintifs negligence Clemens v St Louis  S F R R Co Okla 1913 131 Pac 169 Since the gist of an action for negligence is an injury of which the defendants negligence was the proximate cause Grand Trunk By Co v Ives 1892 144 U S 408 essentially the averment of freedom from contributory negligence is of necessity involved in the averment setting out that the injury was occasioned by the defendants negli gence See Lee v Troy Gas Light Co 1885 98 N Y 115 119 Consequently a plea of contributory negligence is no more in sub stance than a denial of a material allegation of fact in the complaint MacDonell v Buffum N Y 1864 31 How Pr 154 Those juris dictions which put the burden on the plaintiff of proving freedom from contributory negligence Burdick Law of Torts 2nd ed 432 adopt this view of the defense and admit evidence of it under the general denial MacDonell v Buffum supra In such a jurisdiction this plea standing alone would admit negligence in the defendant by mere failure to deny but when joined with a general denial this would be cured and the only objection which might be raised against the answer is that of surplusage See Ross v Neal Ky 1828 7 T B Monroes Rep 407 A great many jurisdictions however make contributory 653COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW negligence an affirmative defense 10 COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW 266 par taking of the nature of a plea in confession and avoidance Wat kinds v So Pac  R Co 1889 38 Fed 711 Linforth v San Fran cisco Electric Co 1909 156 Cal 58 Such a plea obviously admits negligence on the part of the defendant and is therefore inconsistent with the general denial City of Plymouth v Fields 1890 125 Ind 323 Under the code practice however there would be no objection to the joinder of the two pleas Millan v So By Co 1898 54 S C 485 see Leavenworth Light  Heating Co v Waller 1902 65 Kan 514 The principal case therefore although adopting the view that contributory negligence is a matter of denial would be upheld under either theory PLEADING AND PRACTICEGENERAL DENIALESTOPPELUnder a gen eral denial in an action of conversion the defendant introduced evi dence to show that the plaintiff was estopped from asserting owner ship Held the evidence was admissible since an estoppel need not be specially pleaded Feinberg v Allen 1913 208 N Y 215 The common law distinction between a technical estoppel as by record or deed which the defendant was compelled to plead specially and an estoppel in pais which could be proven under a general denial Hostler v Hays 1853 3 Cal 303 Freeman v Cooke 1848 2 Excheq 654 seems to be based on the fact that an estoppel in pais is of an equitable nature see Bigelow Estoppel 603 and therefore the defendant should not be precluded from its use by a technicality In most code states however this distinction has been swept away and under modern statutory procedure all estoppels are treated as new matter Wood v Ostrand 1867 29 Ind 177 McQueen v Bank of Edgemont 1906 27 S Dak 378 The New York doctrine however which is applied in the principal case permits the admission of estop pels in pais under the general denial in the same manner as the defend ant might show title in a stranger and does not require them to be pleaded specially Terry v Buek N Y 1899 40 App Div 419 see Rogers v King N Y 1873 66 Barb 495 The inherent character istics of an estoppel give rise to this conflict of authority Logically all new matter must be affirmatively pleaded but when the defendant sets up an estoppel he does not deny the facts nor does he necessarily avoid the conclusion by new matter If therefore this rule isstrictly applied an estoppel which acts as a bar to a cause of action which once existed must be pleaded while one which prevented the existence of a cause of action could be proved under a general denial Greenway v James 1864 34 Mo 326 and as in the principal case the estoppel showing that the plaintiff did not have title when the goods were con verted could be introduced as evidence The result of this rule would be to draw a technical distinction which would in some cases act harshly but it would at least produce certainty and conformity to the wellestablished rules of pleading QUASICONTRACTSELECTION OF REMEDIESDAMAGESThe defendant set up a counterclaim in quasicontract for the value of securities wrongfully sold by the plaintiff Held the setoff should include merely the proceeds of the sale by the plaintiff and not the reasonable value of the securities Heinze v McKinnon C C A 1913 205 Fed 366 The essential distinction between an action in conversion and one in quasicontract seems to be that the former is based on an obliga tion to recompense the injured party for losses suffered the latter on 654RECENT DECISIONS the obligation to relinquish benefits received by reason of the defend ants assumption of ownership over the plaintiffs chatteL Since in trover the damage to the owner accrues by the act of conversion his loss must be measured at that very time and cannot be affected by what occurs subsequently Wehle v Haviland 1877 69 N Y 448 Ingram v Rankin 1879 47 Wis 406 But in a quasicontractual action the owner has a right to follow his Droperty in the hands of the original wrongdoer and to determine at what period the obliga tion to account for benefits received shall accrue If the defendant sells the plaintiffs goods the latter may elect to consider him an agent and compel him to hold the amount realized from the sale to the plaintiffs use Lamine v Dorrell 1705 2 Ld Raym 1216 see Goodwin v Griffis 1882 88 N Y 629 638 But when the defendant retains or consumes the goods converted in many jurisdictions the plaintiff may elect to treat him as a vendee for a reasonable purchase price assumed to be the value of the goods at the time of conversion Terry v Munger 1890 121 N Y 161 Walker v By 1910 67 W Va 273 but see contra Jones v Hoar Mass 1827 5 Pick 285 It would seem that the fiction of a sale to the wrongdoer should be raised immediately on his assumption in any way of ownership over the chattel and that he should not be able to deprive the plaintiff of an existing remedy by alienating it see Anderson v Bank 1896 5 N D 451 458 Goodwin v Griffis supra since the beneficent fiction whereby a cause of action in conversion may be turned into one in contract was frankly established to give a better and more convenient remedy to the injured party REAL PROPERTYCOVENANT AGAINST INCUMBRANCESNATURE OF IN CUMBRANCESThe plaintiff a grantee of land from the defendant sues on a covenant against incumbrances alleged to have been broken by the existence of an easement incident to the maintenance of a public sewer Held two judges dissenting the existence of the ease ment did not constitute a breach of the covenant First Unitarian Society v Citizens Sav  Trust Co Ia 1913 142 N W 87 The principal case places a public sewer because of the supposedly beneficial effect of such an easement upon the land made servient thereto in the same category with a public highway which is held not to be an incumbrance in Iowaa See Harrison v Ry Co 1894 91 Ia 114 cf Stuhr v Butterfield 1911 151 Ia 736 On the ground however that an incumbrance exists wherever there is a legal obstruc tion to the exercise by a grantee of that dominion over the land to which the lawful owner is entitled the great weight of authority holds that a possible benefit due to the outstanding easement is quite imma terial Mackey v Harmon 1885 34 Minn 168 Tuskegee Land  Secur Co v Birmingham Realtv Co 1909 161 Ala 542 Demars v Koehler 1898 62 N J L 203 Except for the few jurisdictions which adopt the rule that knowledge of the easement by the grantee excludes it from the operation of the covenant see Howell v North ampton R R R o 1905 211 Pa 284 those courts which hold a high way not an incumbrance do so avowedly upon grounds of public policy Huyck v Andrews 1889 113 N Y 81 Harrison v Ry o supra the weight of authority moreover regards a public highway as com ing within the general definition of an incumbrance Kellogg v Inger soll 1806 2 Mass 97 Hubbard v Norton 1835 10 Conn 422 A decision that a public sewer comes within the covenant against incum 655COLUMBIA LAW REVIEW brances would not lead to the flood of litigation which some courts fear would result from a similar holding with respect to a highway see Huyck v Andrews supra so that the principal case seems to be an extension of a rule which is itself in conflict with sound principle REAL PROPERTYESTATES BY ENTRETIESLIENS OF JUDGMENT CRED ITORS OF THE HUSBANDThe grantee of an estate by entireties by joint deed of husband and wife brought an action to have his title declared free from the liens of judgment creditors of the husband Held he had acquired a clear title Beihl v Martin 1912 236 Pa 519 Since the common law gave to the husband the control of his wifes property during coverture he could mortgage or convey an estate by entireties so long as he did not impair her right of survivorship Barber v Harris N Y 1836 15 Wend 615 see Hall v Stevens 1877 65 Mo 670 This estate consequently subject to the wifes right of survivorship was liable for his individual debts until the married womens acts deprived him of the sole usufruct In juris dictions where husband and wife are regarded under the statute as tenants in common for life with the inalienable right of survivor ship creditors of either may levy on the debtors estate and upon sale thereof the purchaser becomes a tenant in common with the other spouse and in the event of the debtors survival he acquires the fee Hiles v Fisher 1895 144 N Y 306 Buttlar v Rosenblath 1877 42 N J Eq 651 But where the common law incidents of this estate are preserved except that the wife has the independent enjoyment of an indivisible share of the usufruct no levy thereon can be made under a judgment against either spouse individually McCurdy v Canning 1870 64 Pa 39 Schliess v Thayer 1912 170 Mich 395 To subject the right of survivorship however to the payment of the husbands debts would not deprive the wife of the right to convey with his consent since she alone cannot convey and is therefore in no worse position when he has placed himself where he cannot consent without prejudice to the rights of third parties than if he had refused his consent A better solution since it both preserves the character of the estate and affords protection to creditors is to grant to creditors of the husband an inchoate lien upon the right of survivorship FleeIc v Zielhaver 1887 117 Pa 213 see Cole ilMfg Co v Collier

Summer Meeting was notable alike for the scientific value of its lecture courses and for the excellent quality of its membership Sixty special students chiefly college instructors and university graduate students were present during the four weeks of the meeting devoting their time to lectures social interchange of views and informal discussions The courses were from three to fifteen lectures in length insuring to each of the lecturers an opportunity to give satisfactory expression to the ideas which he held it of prime importance for advanced students of economics to consider The special advantage of such a meeting lies in the repeated opportunity to question the lecturer and to discuss his views both in private and in the classroom With a picked audience like that of the Summer Meeting the economist may express himself more freely and intelligibly than in print and more fully and effectively than in the associations and gatherings in which but an hour or two at most can be devoted to each subject The following is a synopsis of the lecture courses IMONEY By E Benjamin Andrews LL D President of Brown University Five LecturesJuly 1620 1 Money and the Times 2 Englands

at an early date the first constituting Part I of Professor Clarks eagerly expected work on Distribution the other embodying the out line of Professor Giddings system of political economy which will be received with the more interest because of the fact that in accepting the chair of sociology at Columbia College he turns aside for the present from the formal teaching of this subject Aside from the courses outlined above Professor J B Macmaster delivered four lectures on American economic history and there were several interesting addresses on special subjects notably those by Presi dent Andrews on the Brussels International Monetary Conference by 625 i65i66 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Professor Clark on the Ideal Standard of Value and on the Elemen tary Teaching of Economics by Professor Giddings on the Money Question and on Methods of Teaching Political Economy and by Pro fessor Simon N Patten on Political Economy in Elementary Schools The address last mentioned aroused so much interest that there was an urgent demand for its publication and with sonle modifications it is printed in the present number of the ANNALS On the whole the experiment has proved so successful that it is hoped that a similar series of courses can be arranged for the next meeting in the field of politics and that the University Extension authorities may be able to arrange for a second economic program within a few years A comparison of the course outlined above with any that could have been secured from the economics departments of American Universities even ten years ago would strongly emphasize the advance of this decade ASSOCIATION OF COLLIGES AND PREPARATORY SCHOOLS The sixth annual convention of the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools in the Middle States and Maryland was held at the Johns Hopkins University Baltimore on November 30 and December I The topic which was first discussed was The Place and Teaching of History and Politics in School and College Professor Herbert B Adams of Johns Hopkins University opening the discussion by a paper entitled Is History Past Politics He urged the prominent if not predominating position which the political aspects of history must inevitably assume The close relation and interdependence of history and politics was illustrated in the life and teachings of Professor Lieber of Columbia College and by the methods pursued at the Johns Hopkins University Professor James Harvey Robinson of the University of Pennsyl vania followed Professor Adams reading a paper upon the  Use of the Sources in Teaching History Emphasis was laid upon the absence in our colleges and universities of any opportunity for the student to cultivate his critical faculties in the use of books and in the inter pretation of written records This in itself would seem to justify it was urged some reference to the sources of our knowledge of his torical facts The student is encouraged blindly to accept facts as presented to him in a textbook He never thinks of asking for proofs  Economics for the Elementary Schools 626MISCELLANY and thus an opportunity is lost for cultivating literary tact and dis crimination so essential in picking our way among the ever increasing mass of books which the publishers submit to us  The Place of History in the Secondary Schools  was taken up by Principal Henry P Warren of the Albany Academy Albany N Y This paper dealt especially with that class of historical facts which most naturally excite the interest of younger pupils especially mythol ogy and the accounts of exploration and adventure Only later ought the pupil to be introduced to the history of Greece and Rome and then of France Around the history of the latter country almost all the great tendencies of Moder Europe can be grouped Mr Samuel E Forman of Baltimore in a paper on  Civics in the Secondary Schools  criticised the action of the Conference at Madison as submitted in the report of the Committee of Ten in recommending that civil government be made a part of the instruction in history Civics should be an independent subject the end to be attained by the study is ethical the speaker claimed  rather than educational for as a means of mental discipline civil government is of low value Several suggestions were added in regard to the methods of instruction A discussion followed in which among others Professor Franklin H Giddings of Columbia College and Mr Glenn Mead of the Episcopal Academy Philadelphia took part The afternoon session was devoted to a discussion of the Report on the Requirements for Entrance Examinations in English of the Committee appointed last year by the Association Very interesting papers were read by Professor Stoddard of the University of the City of New York Professor Bright of Johns Hopkins University Mr Farrand of Newark Academy Professor Bliss Perry of Princeton College and Mr Chubb of the Brooklyn Public Schools The report was accepted by the Association Owing to the absence of President Francis I Patton the evening address was made by Professor Ira Remsen of Johns Hopkins Univer sity who spoke especially of the danger arising from the introduction of advanced university methods in the teaching of the less mature students of our colleges The session Saturday morning was devoted to The Future of the College Mr Talcott Williams of the Philadelphia Press opened the discus sion From a compilation of interesting statistics the speaker reached the following deductions First the essential influence of great colleges in stimulating the appetite for a college education and in educating the community  so as to create the soil out of which the college students will grow Secondly the figures seem to prove that the colleges have a local command over their attendance and are not 627 i67t68 ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY sought because they are cheap and easy but because they are near Competition is thus reduced and the standard may be safely raised without diminishing the attendance President Sharpless of Haverford College described the advan tages of the small college and the work it should do as contrasted with the university President Warfield of Lafayette College and President Stryker of Hamilton College presented papers upon other aspects of the same subject In the discussion which followed Pro fessor James of the University of Pennsylvania and Principal Johnson of Friends School at Wilmington Del took part The papers and discussion will be printed in full in the Annual Proceedings of the Association which may be obtained gratis by applying to the secretary Professor J Q Adams University of Penn sylvania

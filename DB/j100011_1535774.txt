Professor J E S Moore and L E Robinson writing on the spermatogonesis of Periplanaia Americana claim that the nucleolus of the first spermatocyte is undoubtedly the homologue of the structure de scribed by Paulmier 99 Montgomery oi and McClung 02 in different forms as one or two of the spermatogonial chromo somes Its morphological resemblance to a chromosome shown by its frequent elongate form Moore and Robinson attribute to mechanical influences and claim that normally it is spherical like the nucleolus In three recent papers Professor E B Wilson 05 o6 has given special attention to this structure in a num ber of forms and the above interpretation of Moore and Robinson he ascribes to superficial work A study of the spermatogenesis of Anasa tristis has convinced us that for this form the interpretation of Moore and Robinson is correct that the nucleolarlike structure of the rest stage is the homologue of the nucleolus of the egg that it is not a chro mosome as claimed by the three cytologists who have investi gated this form In I899 Paulmier identified this body of the rest stage with the two small spermatogonial chromosomes which Wilson has aptly named the  microchromosomes Montgomery in I901 supported Paulmier in this interpreta tion but in I906 he changed his position and now supports Wilson in identifying this structure the socalled chromo some nucleolus as one of the larger spermatogonial chro mosomes an unpaired spermatogonial chromosome called by Wilson the odd or  heterotropic  chromosome Both these in vestigators claim that it divides only in the first division in the second division passing undivided to one pole of the spindle 1 We are indebted to the courtesy of Dr P R Uhler for identifying our material JI9KATHARINE FOOT AND E C STROBELL In Wilsons Studies on Chromosomes Nos II and III he has published several text figures of Anasa tristis including the stages from the contraction phase of the first spermatocyte to the anaphase of the second spindle and also four spermato gonial groups in which he figures an odd number of spermato gonial chromosomes i e io pairs and one large unpaired univalent the odd or  heterotropic  chromosome A study of a large number of smear preparations of the testes of Anasa tristis has forced us to the conclusion that in the spermato genesis of this form there is no socalled accessory chromosome  no odd heterotropic chromosome  that the socalled  chromosome nucleolus  of the rest stage is the homologue of the nucleolus of the egg that in its form and time of disappearance it bears a striking resemblence to the plasmosome of the egg of Allolobophora fcetida Our observations and interpretations are so at variance with the conclusions reached by the three cytolo gists who have studied this form that we would hesitate to take issue with such competent authority were we not able to support our observations by a very large number of photomicrographs of the preparations We have already nearly 200 photographs which seem to demonstrate beyond question the following points That the socalled chromosome nucleolus of the resting spermatocyte is morphologically the equivalent of a nucleolus that it is not a chromosome Wilson has emphasized the evi dence of morphological likeness in his Fig 2 b and c  Studies on Chromosomes II in which he shows a structure which he interprets as a chromosome and which has a marked morpho logical resemblance to his sketch of the  chromosome nucleolus in his Fig a It is significant that in Wilsons three figures of this early pro phase only 6 of the I I bivalents are shown in two of his draw ings and only 7 in the third In fact not one of the investiga tors of this form has given a single figure of this stage in which all the eleven chromosomes are shown In our photographs on the contrary all the I I bivalents are in evidence and not one of them resembles in the least the heterotropic chromosome figured by Wilson This holds true for hundreds of cells in which all the eleven bivalents are present and clearly defined I20ACCESSORY CHROMOSOME IN ANASA TRISTIS It is only when the chromosomes or parts of chromosomes are abnormal that they show a condensed chromatin mass or masses suggesting a resemblance to a nucleolus In many cases one of the arms of a crossshaped chromosome will resemble a round dense nucleolus and this may appear in from one to five of the crosses and again both arms or the entire cross may have de generated into a compact deeply staining mass of chromatin We have a number of photographs of connecting stages between these extremes and they leave no doubt that the normal chro mosome resembles in no way a nucleolus Our preparations also demonstrate that the  chromosome nu cleolus  like the plasmosome of the egg of Allolobophora fwtida has disappeared as a rule when the chromosomes are formed early prophase very rarely persisting until after the chromosomes have attained their definite shape Our smear preparations further demonstrate the absence in the resting spermatocyte of any other structure which can be inter preted as a nucleolus We approached the study of this form with the hope of being able to identify a structure in the male cell which could be interpreted as the homologue of the  accessory nucleolus of the egg but we have found no structure suffi ciently pronounced or constant to justify our interpreting it as an  accessory nucleolus Paulmier 99 Montgomery oi and Wilson o5o6 have all indicated a second nucleolarlike structure in the resting sper matocyte which they interpret as the true plasmosome but we have been unable to demonstrate a second nuleolarlike structure in our smear preparations However in sections of testes fixed with Hermanns fluid and stained with iron haematoxylin and with anilin stains we often find nuclei of resting spermatocytes in which a second nucleolarlike structure is differentiated but the complete absence of such a feature in our smear preparations makes us hesitate to interpret these two structures as the homo logues of the plasmosome and accessory nucleolus of the egg Again our preparations demonstrate that the socalled uni valent  heterotropic  chromosome is distinctly a bivalent Its constant bivalent character indicates that it represents in value 1 Foot  Strobell 1905 121KATHARINE FOOT AND E C STROBELL two spermatogonial chromosomes and not one and when this chromosome is first formed its bivalent character is much more pronounced than at the later prophase stages Our photographs however support Wilson in his claim that it appears only excep tionally as a tetrad  as a rule this and the microchromosomes appear bivalent while all the others show a marked tetrad char acter The frequent eccentric position of this bivalent chromo some outside the characteristic ring arrangement of the chro mosomes in the late prophase seems to warrant suggesting eccentric chromosome as a convenient descriptive name for this special chromosome Individuality of the Chromosomes  Our preparations show a marked individuality ot the chromosomes and in this support the observations of Paulmier Montgomery and Wilson Sev eral of the chromosomes can often be clearly identified during the prophases metaphase and anaphase though a comparison of a large number of photographs demonstrates that theform is not constant For example at a definite prophase 7 8 or 9 of the I bivalents may be clear and sharply defined crosses while again in the same stage we may have all rods or only I 2 or 3 crosses this indicating that the cross type is not invariably asso ciated with any one chromosome During the growth period the chromosomes certainly lose their individuality as completely as in the case of Allolobophora foetida and we have therefore no positive proof that each biva lent of the prophase represents the same chromatin that formed a pair of the spermatogonial univalents There is a certain degree of constancy in the relative sizes of the chromosomes although a definite chromosome may differ greatly in size in dif ferent cells at the same stage of development This may be due in some degree to the technique but this difference is often so great that we feel convinced it is probably due at least in part to an actual difference in the size of the individual chromo somes Montgomery o6 observed an inequality in the size of the two microchromosomes but in our preparations we do not find any support for this observation Plane of the First Division In many cells in which all the I22ACCESSORY CHROMOSOME IN ANASA TRISTIS chromosomes are clearly defined a transverse division for each chromosome can be plainly demonstrated by one photograph In many other cells however it can be as clearly determined that the eccentric chromosome divides longitudinally while all the others divide transversely It may be stated as a rule that the eccentric chromosome divides longitudinally though many exceptions can be demonstrated The Lagging Chromosome of the First Division  At the late anaphase or early telophase of many of the first divisions it can be demonstrated that one of the chromosomes has divided at a later period than the others It may be seen between the two poles in all stages of separation sometimes the entire bivalent will be between the poles its two univalent halves having just separated or one univalent may have reached one pole while the other half still lies midway between the poles We have several photographs in which a lagging chromosome is shown while all the other chromosomes can be counted thus an error in inter pretation is quite impossible As a rule this lagging chromosome appears to be the eccentric chromosome though it cannot be demonstrated that it is invariably the same chromosome which lags in division We have not found this phenomenon with sufficient frequency to justify our interpreting it as a constant feature of this division We think the condition exceptional though not necessarily pathological The Lagging Chromosome of the Second Division The second division shows a phenomenon which appears to us to be the equivalent of the one just described for the first division It is more frequently found for the second spindle than for the first and much more difficult to interpret as these spindles are so exceedingly small and the chromosomes so closely crowded together that cases are rarely found in which all the chromo somes are in evidence and the true value of the lagging chromo some can be safely interpreted We have a few photographs which we think throw some light upon this point All the chromosomes at each pole are demonstrated and the lagging chromosome lying midway between the poles in several cases shows a distinct transverse constriction In one preparation the two halves have separated and in another the two halves have 123KATHARINE FOOT AND E C STROBELL reached opposite poles of the spindle though in these cases the chromosomes at the poles are too crowded to be counted We interpret this lagging chromosome as a univalent being equal in value to all the other chromosomes of the second spindle just as in the first spindle we interpret the lagging chromosome as a bivalent  both cases indicating simply a retarded division of one of the chromosomes Our preparations do not support Wilson and Montgomery in their observation that the lagging chromosome goes over undivided to one pole of the second spindle and we are therefore unable to follow them in supporting McClungs theory of the dimorphism of the spermatozoa If these authors are correct in interpreting this lagging chromo some as only half of a univalent what is the significance of the frequent transverse constriction What can such a constriction mean but foreshadowing a division  and this interpretation is supported by the cases in which the division of this chromosome is actually demonstrated We do not interpret the presence of a lagging chromosome in the first or second spindle as neces sarily an abnormal condition though it may be a step in that direction for we have seen unmistakably pathological spindles where sometimes one and sometimes two chromosomes pass to one pole undivided We have photographs of some of these spindles and their pathological character can be readily recog nized We also have examples of such unequal abnormal separation of the chromosomes in the first and second spindles of Allolobophora fcetida Spermatogonial Chlromosomes  Paulmier 99 who was the first to study the spermatogenesis of this form interpreted the number of spermatogonial chromosomes to be 22 and in his Fig 9 has reproduced one of his sections in which 22 chromo somes are clearly represented Montgomery 01 supports Paulmier in his estimate of the number of spermatogonial chromosomes and in his Fig 74 gives a very clear demonstration of this number Wilson in his Studies on Chromosomes No I corrects this original count of the spermatogonial chromosomes with such positive assurance  that we have great hesitation in questioning 124ACCESSORY CHROMOSOME IN ANASA TRISTIS his results and would not presume to do so were it not possible to corroborate our observations with photomicrographs in which 22 chromosomes can be counted without any question We realize in common with all cytologists the difficulty of getting a correct count of so large a number of small bodies crowded into a contracted space If 2 or more chromosomes are in such close contact that their line of separation is obscured a correct count is impossible It is certainly possible to find cells in which only 21I chromosomes can be differentiated and still easier to find cells in which only 20 or I9 are defined It is much more difficult to find each chrormosome so distinctly isolated that all can be demon strated in one photograph Wilson o0o6 corroborates his original count of 21 sperma togonial chromosomes and illustrates this point in four sketches Montgomery o6 in his last paper withdraws his earlier estimate of the number and supports Wilsons results figuring 21 chromo somes in his sketch No 15 I In view of this weight of authority we do not feel inclined to be in the least dogmatic in our estimate of the count of the chromosomes but our preparations certainly justify us in main taining that it is possible to demonstrate 22 spermatogonial chromosomes in Anasa tristis as we shall show later in photo micrographs of the preparations themselves December I I906 1 Since this paper was sent to press I have determined beyond the possibility of doubt I think that the number of spermatogonial chromosomes in Anasa tristis is 21 not 22 as given by both Paulmier and Montgomery This result is based on a study of a large number of preparations and careful camera drawings of more than 20 per fectly clear metaphase figures have been made All without exception show 2 chromo somes and I have sought in vain for even a single cell that shows 22 125126 KATHARINE FOOT AND E C STROBELL BIBLIOGRAPHY Foot  Strobell 05 Prophase and Metaphase of the first Maturation Spindle of Allolobophora

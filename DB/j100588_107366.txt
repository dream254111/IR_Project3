J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107366,SOME EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID COMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE AND ON ITS CHEMICAL AGENCIES,I206970,I EO3 3 XII SOME EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID COMPOUND OF IODINE ANDOXYGENE AND ON ITS CHEMICAL AGENCIES BY SIR HUMPHRY DAVY LLD FRS READ APRIL 20 1815 IN THE TWO PAPERS CONTAINING RESEARCHES ON IODINE WHICH THE ROYAL SOCIETY HAS DONE ME THE HONOUR OF PUBLISHING IN THE TRANSACTIONS I HAVE DESCRIBED A CLASS OF BODIES CONSISTING OF IODINE OXYGENE AND DIFFERENT BASES ANALOGOUS TO THE HYPER OXYMURIATES IN THE LAST OF THESE PAPERS I MENTIONED THAT I HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO PROCURE ANY BINARY COMBINATION OF IODINE AND OXYGENE FROM THESE COMPOUNDS NEITHER BY THE METHOD PROPOSED BY M GAY LUSSAC NAMELY THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON THE OXYIODE OF BARIUM NOR BY OTHER METHODS OF MY OWN INSTITUTION AND THAT IN EXPERIMENTS ON THE EFFECTS OF THE ACIDS ON THE OXYIODES NEW COMBINATIONS ONLY WERE FORMED I HAVE LATELY RESUMED THIS ENQUIRY AND BY PURSUING A NEW AND ENTIRELY DIFFERENT PLAN OF OPERATION I HAVE AT LAST SUCCEEDED IN COMBINING OXYGENE AND IODINE IN THE FOLLOW ING PAGES I SHALL DESCRIBE THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH LED ME TO ASCERTAIN THE EXISTENCE OF THIS COMPOUND AND I SHALL DETAIL SOME EXPERIMENTS ON ITS ANALYSIS AND ITS CHEMICAL AGENCIES IN THE COURSE OF MY RESEARCHES I OBSERVED THAT WHEN A SOLUTION OF THE COMPOUND OF IODINE AND CHLORINE WAS POURED INTO ALKALINE SOLUTIONS OR EVEN INTO CERTAIN MURIATIC SOLUTIONS THE PRECIPITATE WAS AN OXYIODE AND THIS FACT SEEMED TO INDI CATE THAT IODINE HAD A STRONGER ATTRACTION FOR OXYGENE THA  D D 2O4 SIR HUMPHRY DAVYS EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID CHLORINE IODINE LIKEWISE HAS AN ATTRACTION FOR CHLORINE IT APPEARED THEREFORE EXTREMELY PROBABLE THAT EUCHLORINE OR THE GASEOUS COMBINATION OF OXYGENE AND CHLORINE WOULD BE DECOMPOSED BY HEAT AND TWO COMPOUNDS FORMED ONE OF OXYGENE AND IODINE AND THE OTHER OF IODINE AND CHLORINE OR THAT A TRIPLE COMPOUND WOULD BE PRODUCED FROM WHICH CHLORINE COULD BE EASILY SEPARATED AND ON SUBMITTING THE IDEA TO THE TEST OF EXPERIMENT I FOUND THAT I HAD NOT BEEN DECEIVED TO PRODUCE THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE IT IS NECESSARY MERELY TO BRING THE EUCHLORINE AND IODINE TOGETHER AT THE ORDINARY TEMPERATURE OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS SOON AS THE EUCHLORINE COMES IN CONTACT WITH THE IODINE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE ACTION ITS COLOUR CHANGES TO BRIGHT ORANGE AND A LIQUID IS FORMED WHEN THE EUCHLORINE IS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY A WHITE SUBSTANCE LIKEWISE APPEARS BY THE APPLI CATION OF A GENTLE HEAT THE ORANGE COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND IODINE MAY BE MADE TO RISE IN VAPOUR AND THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE REMAINS WHEN THIS COMPOUND IS REQUIRED TO BE DRY THE EUCHLORINE SHOULD BE PASSED THROUGH DRY MURIATE OF LIME CALCANE BE FORE IT IS ADMITTED TO THE IODINE THE APPARATUS THAT I HAVE EMPLOYED FOR PRODUCING THE SUBSTANCE IS A CURVED BENT TUBE IN THE FORM OF AN INVERTED L R CLOSED AT ONE END THE CLOSED LEG OF THE TUBE BEING LONGEST AND WHICH SERVES AS A RETORT FOR GENERATING THE GAS A THIN LONGNECKED GLASS RECEIVER FOR CONTAINING THE IODINE AND A CURVED TUBE OF SMALLER DIA METER THAN THE FIRST AND CEMENTED OR GROUND INTO IT FOR CON VEYING THE GAS INTO THE RECEIVER THE MURIATE OF LIME IS PLACED IN SOME DRY PAPER IN THE UPPER PART OF THE LARGE CURVED TUBECOMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE AND TO PRODUCE THE SUBSTANCE FROM 40 GRAINS OF IODINE 1OO GRAINS OF THE HYPEROXYMURIATE SHOULD BE USED AND FOUR TIMES THE QUANTITY OF SOLUTION OF MURIATIC ACID OF SPECIFIC GRA VITY ABOUT 1105 A VERY SMALL SPIRIT LAMP SHOULD BE EM PLOYED TO GENERATE THE GAS AND TO PREVENT EXPLOSIONS THE HEAT SHOULD BE APPLIED WITH GREAT CARE AND ONLY TO THE BOTTOM OF THE TUBE THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE WHEN ENTIRELY FREED BY HEAT FROM THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND CHLORINE APPEARS AS A WHITE SEMITRANSPARENT SOLID IT HAS NO SMELL BUT A STRONG ASTRINGENT SOUR TASTE ITS SPECIFIC GRAVITY IS CONSIDERABLE FOR IT RAPIDLY SINKS IN SULPHURIC ACID WHEN HEATED STRONGLY IT DECOMPOSES UNDERGOING FUSION AT THE MOMENT AND IS EN TIRELY CONVERTED INTO GASEOUS MATTER AND IODINE LEAVING NO RESIDUUM WHATEVER IT REQUIRES FOR ITS ENTIRE DECOMPOSITION A HEAT WHICH IS RATHER BELOW THE BOILING POINT OF OLIVE OIL AND THERE SEEMS TO BE LITTLE OR NO INCREASE OF TEMPERATURE IN THE PROCESS ITS NATURE IS PROVED BOTH BY ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS FOR WHEN EUCHLORINE ACTS UPON IODINE THE VOLATILE SUBSTANCE PRO DUCED HAS ALL THE CHARACTERS OF THE BODY PRODUCED BY THE IMMEDIATE ACTION OF CHLORINE ON IODINE AND WHEN THE COM POUND I AM DESCRIBING IS DECOMPOSED IN A PNEUMATIC APPA RATUS THE GAS FORMED IS FOUND TO BE PURE OXYGENE AND THE SOLID SUBLIMATE PRODUCED IS PURE IODINE I ENDEAVOURED TO DETERMINE THE PROPORTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS IN THE COMPOUND BY DECOMPOSING IT IN GLASS TUBES CAREFULLY WEIGHED AND ASCERTAINING THE LOSS OF WEIGHT OF THE TUBE AND THE VOLUME OF OXYGENE EVOLVED I HAVE USED VERY SMALL QUANTITIES OF THE SUBSTANCE BUT AS MY BALANCE IS DELICATE I EO5SIR HUMPIRY DAVYS EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID DO NOT THINK THERE CAN BE ANY CONSIDERABLE ERROR IN THE RESULTS I GIVE THOSE WHICH I CONSIDER AS THE MOST ACCURATE IN ONE EXPERIMENT 3 GRAINS OF THE SUBSTANCE AFFORDED A QUANTITY OF OXYGENE EQUAL TO 5173 GRAIN MEASURES OF WATER AND LOST IN WEIGHT 68 IN A SECOND EXPERIMENT E GRAINS AFFORDED 3483 GRAIN MEASURES OF OXYGENE IN A THIRD EXPE RIMENT I GRAIN YIELDLED 191 GRAIN MEASURES OF OXYGENE MANY EXPERIMENTS THAT I HAVE LATELY MADE HAVE CONVINCED ME THAT IN MY FIRST PAPER I RATED THE NUMBER REPRESENTING THE PROPORTION IN WHICH IODINE COMBINES TOO LOW INDEED AT THE TIME I STATED THAT MY RESULTS AFFORDED RUDE APPROXI MATIONS THEY DEMONSTRATED MERELY THAT IODINE WAS REPRE SENTED BY A VERY HIGH NUMBER IN AN EXPERIMENT RECENTLY MADE WITH CARE 50 GRAINS OF THE IODE OF POTASSIUM DECOM POSED BY NITRIC ACID AFFORDED 328 GRAINS OF NITRE ACCORD ING TO THIS RESULT THE NUMBER REPRESENTING THE PROPORTION IN WHICH IODINE COMBINES IS 2273 BUT I DO NOT VETLTURE TO STATE THIS NUMBER AS EXACT AS I AM NOT SECURE OF THE PURITY OF THE HYDRATE OF POTASSA FROM WHICH THE IODE WAS MADE THE COMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE IS VERY SOLUBLE IN WATER IT SLOWLY DELIQUESCES IN A MOIST ATMOSPHERE BUT RE MAINS UNALTERED WHEN THE AIR IS DRY ITS SOLUTION FIRST REDDENS AND THEN DESTROYS VEGETABLE BLUES AND REDUCES OTHER VEGE TABLE COLOURS TO A DULL YELLOW WHEN ITS AQUEOUS SOLUTION IS HEATED AS THE WATER RISES IN VAPOUR IT GRADUALLY THICKENS GAINS THE CONSISTENCE OF A SYRUP BECOMES PASTY AND AT LENGTH BY A STRONGER HEAT YIELDS THE SOLID SUBSTANCE UNALTERED UNLESS A SUFFICIENT HEAT IS APPLIED TO DECOMPOSE A PORTION OF IT WHEN IT GAINS A PURPLISH TINT APPARENTLY FROM SOME IODINE SET FREE THE PASTY SUBSTANCE THAT IT FORMS IS EVIDENTLY AN HYDRATE FOR IT YIELDS MOISTURE DURING ITS DECOMPOSITION O6COMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE O7 ITS ACTION UPON INFLAMMABLE BODIES IS SUCH AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED FROM ITS COMPOSITION WHEN IT IS HEATED MIXED WITH CHARCOAL SULPHUR RESIN SUGAR OR THE COMBUSTIBLE METALS IN A FINELY DIVIDED STATE DETONATIONS ARE PRODUCED AND ITS SOLU TION RAPIDLY CORRODES ALL THE METALS WHICH I HAVE EXPOSED IT TO AND IT ACTS BOTH UPON GOLD AND PLATINUM BUT MUCH MORE INTENSELY ON THE FIRST OF THESE METALS WHEN A SOLUTION OF IT IS POURED INTO SOLUTIONS OF THE ALKA LIES OR ALKALINE EARTHS OR WHEN MADE TO ACT ON THEIR CARBO NATES OXYIODES OR TRIPLE COMPOUNDS OF OXYGENE IODINE AND THE METALLIC BASES ARE THE RESULTS BY ITS ACTION ON SOLUTION OF AMMONIA A SUBSTANCE IS PRODUCED APPARENTLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH IS FORMED BY THE ACTION OF THE COMPOUND OF IODINE AND CHLORINE SATURATED WITH CHLORINE ON THE SAME SOLUTION AND WHICH I HAVE MENTIONED IN A FORMER PAPER AND WHICH CONSEQUENTLY MUST BE REGARDED AS AN OXYIODE OF AMMONIA WHEN AN AQUEOUS SOLUTION OF THE COMPOUND IS POURED INTO A SOLUTION OF THE SOLUBLE SALTS OF BARYTA AND STRONTIA A COPIOUS PRECIPITATE OF THEIR RESPECTIVE OXYIODES IS PRODUCED THE OXYIODE OF BARIUM AS I HAVE MENTIONED IN MY LAST CORMMU NICATION ON IODINE IS A COMPOUND VERY SLIGHTLY SOLUBLE IN WATER THAT OF STRONTIUM IS RATHER MORE SOLUBLE AND THOSE OF CALCIUM MAGNESIUM GLUCINUM ITTRIUM ALUMINUM ZIRCONUM ARE MORE SO AND I BELIEVE IN THE ORDER IN WHICH THEY HAVE BEEN NAMED IT FORMS COMBINATIONS WITH ALL THE METALLIC OXIDES I HAVE TRIED ITS AGENCY UPON AND PRECIPITATES LEAD AND MERCURY FROM THEIR NITROUS SOLUTIONS THE ACTION OF THE COMPOUND UPON ACIDS IS MUCH MORE SIN GULAR THAN THAT UPON ALKALIES EAITHS OR METALLIC OXIDES IT2O8 SIR HUMPHRY DAVYS EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID APPEARS TO FORM COMBINATIONS WITH ALL THE FLUID OR SOLID ACIDS TO WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EXPOSE IT THAT IT DOES NOT DE COMPOSE WHEN SULPHURIC ACID IS DROPPED INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLUTION OF IT IN HOT WATER A SOLID SUBSTANCE IS PRECIPITATED WHICH CONSISTS OF THE ACID AND THE COMPOUND  FOR ON EVAPO RATING THE SOLUTION BY A GENTLE HEAT NOTHING RISES BUT WATER ON INCREASING THE HEAT IN AN EXPERIMENT OF THIS KIND THE SOLID SUBSTANCE FORMED FUSED AND ON COOLING THE MIXTURE RHOM BOIDAL CRYSTALS FORMED OF A PALE YELLOW COLOUR WHICH WERE VERY FUSIBLE AND WHICH DID NOT CHANGE AT THE HEAT AT WHICH THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE DECOMPOSES BUT SUB LIMED UNALTERED WHEN URGED BY A MUCH STRONGER HEAT IT PARTIALLY SUBLIMED AND PARTIALLY DECOMPOSED AFFORDING OXY GENE IODINE AND SULPHURIC ACID WITH HYDROPHOSPHORIC ACID THE COMPOUND PRESENTS PHE IOMENA PRECISELY SIMILAR AND THEY FORM TOGETHER A SOLID YEL LOW CRYSTALLINE COMBINATION IT DISSOLVES IN SOLUTION OF HYDROPHOSPHOROUS ACID BUT ON HEATING THE COMBINATION IODINE IS IMMEDIATELY PRODUCED BY A DECOMPOSITION OF PART OF THE COMPOUND AND THE REMAIN ING PART UNITES TO THE PHOSPHORIC ACID FORMED WHEN HYDRONITRIC ACID IS POURED INTO A CONCENTRATED SOLU TION OF IT WHITE CRYSTALS FORM IN PLATES OF A RHOMBOIDAL FIGURE AND WHICH WHEN DRIED PARTIALLY DECOMPOSE AND PARTIALLY SUBLIME AT A MUCH LOWER HEAT THAN THE SULPHURIC OR PHOS PHORIC COMPOUNDS AND AFFORD HYDRONITRIC ACID OXYGENE AND IODINE IT DISSOLVES IN SOLUTION OF OXALIC ACID BUT BY A VERY GENTLE HEAT THE OXYGENE OF THE COMPOUND ACTS ON THE INFLAMMABLE BASES OF THE ACIDS AND IODINE AND CARBONIC ACID ARE DISENGAGED IN GREAT QUANTITIESCOMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE O BY LIQUID MURIATIC ACID THE SUBSTANCE IS IMMEDIATELY DECOM POSED AND THE COMPOUND OF CHLORINE AND IODINE IS FORMED WHEN BORACIC ACID WAS ADDED TO A SOLUTION OF THE NEW COMPOUND IT DISSOLVED IN IT BY HEAT AND DID NOT CRYSTALLIZE ON COOLING BY EVAPORATION A SOLID WHITE SUBSTANCE WAS PROCURED NOT SO EASILY DECOMPOSED BY HEAT AS THE COMPOUND ITSELF THE TASTE OF ALL THESE ACID COMPOUNDS IS VERY SOUR THOUGH IN DIFFERENT DEGREES OF INTENSITY THEY REDDEN VEGETABLE BLUES AND THEY DISSOLVE GOLD AND PLATINUM WHEN THEY ARE MADE TO ACT ON THE ALKALIES OR EARTHS OR ON SALINE SOLUTIONS WHICH THEY ARE CAPABLE OF DECOMPOSING COMMON NEUTRAL SALTS AND OXY IODES ARE FORMED AT THE SAME TIME THE FACTS OF THE COMBINATION OF THE NEW COMPOUND WITH ACIDS SERVE TO EXPLAIN THE PHENOMENA OF THE ACTION OF THESE SUBSTANCES ON THE OXYIODES WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED IN MY LAST PAPER ON IODINE AND THEY CONFIRM THE OPINIONS THERE STATED ON THE NATURE OF THIS ACTION THE SUBSTANCE PROCURED BY M GAY LUSSAC BY THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON THE SOLUTION OF THE OXYIODE OF BARIUM AND WHICH HE HAS SUPPOSED TO BE A PURE COMBINATION OF OXYGENE AND IODINE MIXED WITH A LITTLE SUL PHURIC ACID HAS EVIDENTLY FOR ITS BASE THE COMBINATION JUST NOW DESCRIBED OF SULPHURIC ACID AND THE NEW COMPOUND AND AS I HAVE SHOWN IT LIKEWISE CONTAINS BARYTA HOWEVER MINUTE THE QUANTITY OF SULPHURIC ACID MADE TO ACT ON OXYIODE OF BARIUM A PART OF IT IS ALWAYS EMPLOYED TO FORM THE COMPOUND ACID AND THE RESIDUAL FLUID CONTAINS BOTH THE COMPOUND ACID AND A CERTAIN QUANTITY OF THE ORIGINAL SALT THAT THIS COMPOUND ACID IS A TRUE CHEMICAL COMBINATION IS EVIDENT FROIN THE OBSERVATIONS ALREADY DETAILED AND FROM MIDCCCXV E ESIR HUMPHRY DAVYS EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID ITS CRYSTALLINE FORM THERE IS EVERY REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE PROPORTIONS OF ITS ELEMENTS ARE DEFINITE IN ONE EXPE RIMENT I FOUND THAT A SMALL QUANTITY OF THE NEW COMPOUND IN BEING CONVERTED INTO THE RHOMBOIDAL CRYSTALS GAINED RATHER LESS THAN HALF ITS ORIGINAL WEIGHT FROM THE ADDITION OF THE ACID I E 2 GRAINS BECAME 28 GRAINS IN EXPERIMENTS IN WHICH THE PRODUCTS OF THE DECOMPOSITION OF THE COMPOUNDS FROM PHOSPHORIC AND SULPHURIC ACIDS WERE COLLECTED THE ACIDS DISENGAGED WERE FOUND IN THEIR STATE OF HYDRATES FROM WHICH IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE CRYSTALLINE COMPOUNDS ARE HYDRATES AND THAT THE COMMON ACIDS CARRY THEIR DEFINITE PROPORTION OF WATER INTO THE COMBINATION IT IS NOT INDEED UNLIKELY THAT THE PRESENCE OF WATER IS CONNECTED WITH THE PHENOMENON OF COMBINATION AND THERE IS AN INSTANCE OF THIS KIND WHICH I LONG AGO POINTED OUT SULPHUROUS ACID GAS AND NITROUS ACID GAS APPEAR TO HAVE NO ACTION ON EACH OTHER UNLESS WATER BE PRESENT BUT WITH THE VAPOUR OF WATER THEY FORM A SOLID CRYSTALLINE HYDRATE REASONING FROM ANALOGY IT IS PROBABLE THAT A COMPOUND OF OXYGENE MAY BE FORMED CONTAINING LESS OXYGENE THAN THE NEW COMPOUND I HAVE MADE MANY EXPERIMENTS WITH THE HOPE OF DISCOVERING A BODY OF THIS KIND BUT WITHOUT ANY DECIDED SUCCESS WHEN THE SOLUTION OF THE NEW COMPOUND IS MADE TO ACT ON THE DOUBLE COMPOUND OF IODINE AND THE ALKALINE METALS IODINE IS PRODUCED WHICH DURING ITS SUBLIMA TION YIELDS NO GASEOUS PRODUCT IODINE HEATED IN A SOLUTION OF THE NEW COMPOUND SLIGHTLY COLOURS IT BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE MERELY IN CONSEQUENCE OF ITS COMBINING WITH THE WATER AND THE IODINE RISES IN VAPOUR WITH THE WATER WITHOUT DECOM POSING THE COMPOUND IN SOME EXPERIMENTS ON THE ACTION OF 91OCOMPOUND OF IODINE IAD OXYGENE EUCHLORINE ON IODINE IN WHICH THE IODINE WAS IN GREAT EXCESS THE SOLID SUBSTANCE FORMED HAD A CHOCOLATE TINT BUT THIS MAY POSSIBLY HAVE DEPENDED UPON A SMALL QUANTITY OF FREE IODINE AND WHEN DISSOLVED IN WATER IT AFFORDED BY THE EVAPORATION OF THE WATER THE WHITE COMPOUND ONLY I DETAILED IN MY LAST PAPER ON IODINE SOME UNSUCCESSFUL ATTEMPTS TO PROCURE A COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE FROM THE CHLORIONIC ACID THE SUBSTANCE PRODUCED BY THE AGENCY OF THE COMBINATION OF IODINE AND CHLORINE IN WATER ON THE IDEA THAT WATER WAS DECOMPOSED IN THIS EXPERIMENT I HAVE MADE SOME FURTHER RESEARCHES ON THE SUPPOSITION THAT IT MIGHT CONTAIN A COMPOUND OF IODINE CONTAINING LESS OXYGENE THAN THIS NEW SUBSTANCE  BUT WITHOUT ANY SUCCESS  NEITHER BY DIS TILLATION AT VERY LOW TEMPERATURES NOR BY THE ACTION OF SMALL QUANTITIES OF OXIDE OF SILVER NOR BY ANY OTHER MEANS HAVE I BEEN ABLE TO SEPARATE ANY COMPOUND OF OXYGENE FROM IT AND WHEN IT FORMS TRIPLE COMPOUNDS THE OXYIODES BY ITS ACTION UPON ALKALIES OR EARTHS OR METALLIC SOLUTIONS IT APPEARS THAT THE OXYGENE OF THE ALKALIES OR EARTHS IS ONLY NEWLY COMBINED AT THE MOMENT OF ITS OPERATION UPON THEM AN EFFECT ASSISTED BY THE ATTRACTION OF THE BASES OF THE EARTHS FOR CHLORINE THE CONCLUSION WHICH I FORMED THAT THE CHLORIONIC ACID IS A SIMPLE COMBINATION OF THE CHLORIONIC SUBLIMATE IN WATER IS STILL FAR THER PROVED BY THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ACTION OF MURIATIC ACID ON THE NEW SOLID COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE PAGE 209  THE CHLORIONIC ACID OFFERS AN EASY METHOD OF PROCURING PURE BARYTA BY DROPPING A SOLUTION OF IT INTO SOLUTION OF MURIATE OF BARIUM AS I HAVE SHOWN IN MY LAST PAPER ON IODINE A PRECIPITATE OF OXYIODE OF BARIUM IS PRODUCED WHICH WHEN DECOMPOSED BY A STRONG HEAT YIELDS PURE BARYTA THE ATTRACTION OF OXYGENE FOR BARIUM BEING AS I HAVE STATED STRONGER AT THIS TEMPERATURE THAN THAT OF IODINE E E 21112E SIR HUMPHRY DAVYS EXPERIMENTS ON A SOLID AS I HAVE CALLED THE COMPOUNDS OF OXYGENE IODINE AND BASES OXYIODES I VENTURE TO PROPOSE A NAME IN CONFORMITY THAT OF OXYIODINE FOR THE NEW SOLID COMPOUND AND OXYIODIC ACID FOR THE ACID COMPOUND IT FORMS WITH WATER M GAY LUSSAC AS I AM INFORMED HAS PROPOSED IN A PAPER WHICH I HAVE NOT YET BEEN SO FORTUNATE AS TO PROCURE BUT WHICH IS SAID TO CONTAIN MANY NEW AND IMPORTANT FACTS THE NAME OF IODIC ACID FOR THE COMPOUND OF OXYGENE AND IODINE THE EXISTENCE OF WHICH HE CONCEIVED HE HAD PROVED BY HIS EXPERIMENT ON THE ACTION OF SULPHURIC ACID ON THE OXYIODE OF BARIUM AND THE TERMS IODATS FOR THE SUBSTANCES CONSISTING OF OXYGENE IODINE AND BASES I AM WILLING TO PAY EVERY COMPLIMENT TO THE SAGA CITY OF THIS INGENIOUS CHEMIST IN ANTICIPATING THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE NATURE OF A BODY THE SEPARATE EXISTENCE OF WHICH HE HAD NOT DEMONSTRATED BY EXPERIMENT BUT THE TERM IODIC ACID DOES NOT APPEAR TO ME SUFFICIENTLY DEFINITE FOR THE HYDRO IONIC ACID AND THE CHLORIONIC ACID AS WELL AS THE OXYIODIC ACID MAY BE ALL CALLED AS A CLASS IODIC ACIDS OR ACIDS FROM IODINE AND THE TERMINATION IN AT WOULD PLACE THE OXYIODES IN THE COMMON CLASS OF NEUTRAL SALTS FROM WHICH THEY DIFFER IN MANY RESPECTS WHEN THEY BECOME BINARY COMPOUNDS IN CONSEQUENCE OF THEIR DECOMPOSITION BY HEAT THOUGH THEY LOSE ALL THEIR OXYGENE THEIR NEUTRAL AND SALINE CHARACTER REMAINS UNALTERED WHICH IS NOT THE CASE WITH ANY OTHER KNOWN CLASS OF BODIES EXCEPT THE HYPEROXYMURIATES AND THE TERMS IODES AND OXYIODES WHICH I PROPOSED IN THE FIRST PAPER IN WHICH THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THESE BODIES WAS POINTED OUT SUFFICIENTLY EXPRESS THE NATURE OF THE DOUBLE AND TRIPLE COM POUND AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THEM I AM DESIROUS OF MARKING THE ACID CHARACTER OF OXYIODINECOMPOUND OF IODINE AND OXYGENE COMBINED WITH WATER WITHOUT APPLYING THE NAME ACID TO THE ANHYDROUS SOLID IT IS NOT AT ALL IMPROBABLE THAT THE ACTION OF THE HYDROGENE IN THE COMBINED WATER IS CONNECTED WITH THE ACID PROPERTIES OF THE COMPOUND FOR THIS ACID MAY BE REGARDED AS A TRIPLE COMBINATION OF IODINE HYDROGENE AND OXYGENE AN OXYIODE OF HYDROGENE AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE HYDROGENE MAY ACT THE SAME PART IN GIVING CHARACTER THAT POTASSIUM SODIUM OR THE METALLIC BASES PERFORM IN THE OXYIODES AND AS HYDROGENE COMBINED WITH IODINE FORMS A VERY STRONG ACID AND AS THIS ACID WOULD REMAIN SUPPOSING ALL THE OXYGENE TO BE TAKEN AWAY FROM THE OXYIODIC ACID IT IS A FAIR SUPPOSITION THAT ITS ELEMENTS MUST HAVE AN INFLUENCE IN PRODUCING THE ACIDITY OF THE SUBSTANCE REOME FETRUARY XO IS X5 213

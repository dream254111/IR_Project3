XXXIII AN ACCOUNT OF THE TRANSIT OF VENUS OVER THE SUN ON SATURDAY MORNING 6TH JUNE 1761 AT SAVILEHOUSE ABOUT 8 OF TIME WEST OF ST PAULS  LONDON H I S ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF YORK BEING DESIROUS OF OBSERVING THE RARE PHAENOMENON OF VENUSS PASSAGE OVER THE DISK OF THE SUN I HAD THE HONOUR OF BEING COM MANDED BY HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS TO ATTEND HIM ON THAT OCCASION AT SAVILEHOUSE WHICH WAS A PLACE THE MOST PROPER FOR THAT OBSERVATION ON ACCOUNT OF ITS REMARKABLE ELEVATION ABOVE ALL THE NEIGHBOURING BUILDINGS AND CONSEQUENTLY ABOVE THE GROSS VAPOURS OF THE TOWN READ JUNE 11 1761 IN OBEDIENCE TO THESE ORDERS ON FRIDAY 5TH JUNE I CARRIED THITHER THE INSTRUMENTS PROPER FOR THIS OB SERVATION TOGETHER WITH AN ASTRONOMICAL CLOCK MADE BY MR SHELTON AND THE FELLOW OF THAT WHICH WAS LAST MADE FOR THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT GREENWICH AND WHICH STANDS IN THE TRANSITROOM AND WENT TO THE SAID HOUSE ON SATURDAY MORNING AT FOUR OCLOCK IN COMPANY WITH THE REVEREND DR BLAIR AND DR BEVIS AND IMMEDIATELY PUT THE INSTRUMENTS IN ORDER THE INSTRUMENTS MADE USE OF ON THIS OCCASION WERE A REFLECTING TELESCOPE OF 18 INCHES FOCUS WITH A HELIOSCOPE ADAPTED TO IT AND HAVING A FIELD OF MORE THAN THE SUNS DIAMETER PROPER FOR SHEWING VENUS ON THE SUNS DISK WITH GREAT EASE AND SATISFACTION  N B ST PAULS IS 2212 WEST OF GREENWICH OBSERVATORY AND179 AND ANOTHER REFLECTOR OF 2 FEET FOCUS WITH AN ACHRO MIC OBJECTGLASS MICROMETER OF 40 FEET FOCUS BEING THE SAME SORT OF INSTRUMENT WITH THOSE THAT WERE MADE BY ORDER OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY FOR DR BRAD LEY AT THE ROYAL OBSERVATORY AT GREENWICH AND FOR MR MASKELYNE WHO WENT TO ST HELENA AND MR MASON WHO WENT TO BENCOOLEN DIFFERING IN ONE PARTICULAR FROM THEIR INSTRUMENTS WHICH HAD ONLY A COMMON OBJECTGLASS MICROMETER I INTENDED TO HAVE MEASURED THE DISTANCE OF VENUS FROM EACH LIMB OF THE SUN IN CHORDS PARALLEL TO THE PLANE OF THE EQUATOR AND IN CHORDS PARALLEL TO THE HORIZON AND ALSO TO HAVE TAKEN THE APPULSES OF THE LIMBS OF THE SUN AND VENUS TO A VERTICAL AND HORIZON TAL WIRE AND HAD ALL THE APPARATUS NECESSARY FOR THOSE OBSERVATIONS BUT THE CLOUDINESS OF THE MORNING PRE VENTED MY PUTTING ANY OF THOSE METHODS INTO PRACTICE FOR THE CLOUDS CONTINUED SO CLOSE THAT WE HAD NO SIGHT OF THE SUN TILL A QUARTER OF AN HOUR BEFORE SIX OCLOCK WHEN THROUGH AN OPENING WHICH LASTED FOR ABOUT TWO MINUTES DR BLAIR DR BEVIS AND I PLAINLY AND DISTINCTLY SAW VENUS ON THE SUN AND CONCLUDED THAT SHE WAS THEN CONSIDERABLY PAST THE MIDDLE OF HER TRANSIT ABOUT A QUARTER AFTER SIX I MADE THE FIRST OBSERVATION WHICH WAS IN MEASURING THE DIAMETER OF VENUS AND SOON AFTER I MEASURED HER DISTANCE FROM THE SUNS LIMB IN THE DIRECTION OF A LINE GOING THROUGH THE SUNS CENTER AND SO CON TINUED MEASURING IN THE SAME MANNER AND SOMETIMES MEASURING THE DIAMETER OF VENUS TILL NEAR THE INTER NAL CONTACT ONLY ABOUT A QUARTER AFTER SEVEN I MEA SURED THE DISTANCE OF VENUS FROM THE SUNS LIMB IN A A 2 A SUP180 A SUPPOSED DIRECTION OF HER TRANSIT LINE OR PATH OVER THE SUN ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AFTER SEVEN THE CLOUDS DISPERSED AND WE HAD THE SUN PERFECTLY CLEAR DURING THE RE MAINDER OF THE TRANSIT WHEN VENUS APPROACHED THE INTERNAL CONTACT I TOOK OFF THE MICROMETER AND CHANGED THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE TELESCOPE WHICH DURING THE MEASUREMENTS HAD BEEN THAT OF 70 TIMES INTO ANOTHER OF 140 TIMES AND WITH THIS MAGNIFYING POWER I OBSERVED THE INTERNAL CONTACT IN WHICH I THINK I CANNOT HAVE ERRED SO MUCH AS TWO SECONDS FOR THE AIR WAS EXTREMELY CLEAR AND AT REST WITH THE SAME MAGNIFYING POWER I OBSERVED THE TOTAL EXIT AND I DO NOT THINK I HAVE ERRED IN THIS ABOVE FIVE SECONDS THOUGH THIS IS A MORE UNCER TAIN OBSERVATION THAN THE FORMER AND CAN BY NO MEANS BE DETERMINED SO ACCURATELY AS THE INTERNAL CONTACT AND WHAT I HAVE ERRED IN THIS LAST OBSERVA TION IS RATHER IN EXCESS IN MAKING THE EXIT TOO LATE I HAVE MENTIONED ABOVE THE MAGNIFYING POWER OF THE TELESCOPE I USED BECAUSE I HAVE FOUND BY EXPERIENCE THAT THE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF TELESCOPES THEIR DIFFERENT MAGNIFYING POWERS AND THEIR DIFFERENT GOODNESS AS WELL AS THE DIFFERENT GOODNESS OF EYES WANT OF PRACTICE AND DIFFERENT STATE OF THE AIR WILL PRODUCE DIFFERENCES OF TIMES IN THOSE SORT OF OBSERVA TIONS THESE OBSERVATIONS WERE MADE IN THE PRESENCE OF HIS ROYAL HIGHNESS THE DUKE OF YORK ACCOMPANIED BY THEIR ROYAL HIGHNESSES PRINCE WILLIAM PRINCE HENRY AND PRINCE FREDERICK HER ROYAL HIGHNESS LADY AUGUSTA WAS PLEASED LIKEWISE TO DO US THE HO NOUR OF LOOKING AT THIS UNCOMMON APPEARANCE TIMES181 TIMES AND MEASUREMENTS TAKEN AT SAVILEHOUSE ON SATURDAY MORNING 6TH JUNE 1761 MR SHORT

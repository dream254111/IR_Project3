seems to rest in the manner of collecting the Plankton The Hensen net and its method of use are open to objections and filtration methods vary widely in their ac curacy and results Experiments carried on at the marine laboratory of the Rhode Island Agricultural Experiment Station seem to show that the collection and de termination of Plankton by a centrifuge is a very rapid and accurate method and that the results read volumetrically on the gradu ated glass collector are of value when taken in connection with the nature of the ma terial collected The total percentage of Planktonts obtained and their condition especially of the most delicate forms far surpasses any other method known to me The work has been carried on with the Plantonokrit designed and described by Dr C S Dolley Proc Acad Nat Sci Phila May 1896 The machine acts upon a fixed quantity of water 2 cans each of I litre capacity Nearly two years work with the method have given results suffi cient to warrant continued experiments Note on Ascidian Anatomy M M METCALF Neural glandA neural gland is pres ent in all groups of Tunicates including Appendicularice Salpidce Octacnemus Its positionIn Appendicularice dorsal in Simple Ascidians dorsolateral Molgulidce dorsal Cynthiidce or ventral in Compound Ascidians dorsal Botryllidce or ventral ventral in Doliolidce Pyrosomidce Salpidoe and Octacnemus Its sizeInsignificant in Appendicularia in Ascidians varies from a minute and nearly functionless gland to a size fifteen times as large as the ganglion in Pyrosoma and Salpa small in Doliolum equal to the ganglion Many Simple Ascidians have the gland prolonged into the dorsal raphe i e into the median portion of the pharyngeocloacal septum In most of these species merely the duct of the gland is so prolonged in other forms the raphe contains much glan dular tissue in connection with the duct In some species of Simple and Compound Ascidians the tissue of the gland is continu ous with the cellular area of the ganglion recalling the way in which they both are formed from a common structure the vis ceral region of the larval neural tube This origin of the gland from the neural tube as described by Julin is readily demonstrated in Molgula Manhattensis and in Ecteinascidia turbinata In all species studied the secretion of the gland is formed by the degeneration and disintegration of cells proliferated from the walls of the duct or its branches It is therefore extremely doubtful if the gland has any renal function No concretions were found The condition of the gland is very differ ent in different species The divergence affects its size position and shape Portions present in one species may be absent in an other species of the same genus The homology of the gland in Salpa with that of the Ascidians is doubtful Function of ciliated funnelIt is not merely the aperture of the duct of the gland for 1 it is often not connected with the gland though well developed e g Salpa and 2 it has a rich innervation in several species of Simple Ascidians and ap parently in some Salpas In some species at least it is probably a sense organ The intersiphonal organs of Tunicates show a remarkable asymmetry Assuming the sagittal plane of the ganglion to coincide with that of the whole animal the funnel is on the right side and so also is often the whole or a part of the gland In Molgula Manhattensis there is a great semilunar fold of ectoderm that pushes into the cloaca parallel to the pharyngeocloacal 202 SCIENCESCIENCE septum serving to support the latter and also to support the oviducts G H PARKER HARVARD UNIVERSITY Secretary To be concluded CURRENT NOTES ON PHYSIOGRAPHY DRAINAGE OF SOUTHERN OHIO THE greater part of the Allegheny plateau and its westward slope is drained by streams of the simplest kind dissecting horizontal strata in irregularly branching valleys But for some years aberrant val ley forms have been recognized in the upper Ohio region special attention having been given to their meaning by W G Tight in his latest article on Some preglacial drainage features of southern Ohio Bull Scient Lab Denison Univ IX 1897 22 32 Confirmation is given to earlier views as to the composite origin of the modern Ohio The preglacial drainage of the region led the Kanawha via Teazes Valley Big Sandy and other streams northward across the present Ohio Valley to a commontrunk near Waverly By some process not speci fied the Ohio was given a course across the middle of this earlier system deepening the older valleys for part of the distance and elsewhere trenching across the divides at the lowest cols The trenched cols where the Ohio Valley is narrow and steepwalled occur below Vanceburg just above Ports mouth and above Guyandotte Leverett appends a brief account of his contribution to this problem 1 c 1821 THE COASTAL PLAIN OF MEXICO STUDIES by J W Spencer  Great changes of level in Mexico and the interoceanic con nections  Bull Geol Soc Amer IX 1897 1334 give among other matters an ac count of the coastal plain or tierra caliente that fronts the Mexican plateaus on the Gulf side It has a breadth of fifty miles back of Vera Cruz reaching an elevation of 20 1560 feet at the inner margin where the plateau ascends boldly thousands of feet above it The inclined surface of the plain has not a uniform rise but is made up of a number of steps or terraces 50 to 100 feet high with sloping plains between them Streams descend from the plateau in val leys having a succession of reaches and falls the same streams trench their way across the coastal plain A brief account is given of the  Geological Canal of Chivela on the divide of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec 776 feet above the sea its floor having lately been swept over the ocean currents during a depressed attitude of the region MOUNTAIN STRUCTURES OF PENNSYLVANIA THE prevalent belief in the frequent oc currence of synclinal ridges in denuded mountain ranges is discussed by A P Chit tenden Bull Amer Geogr Soc XXIX 1897 175180 who cites the opinions of a number of authors on the matter After showing that there is no logical reason to expect the more frequent occurrence of synclinal than of anticlinal ridges in ancient deeply dissected mountains the Appalachian ridges of Pennsylvania are classified and measured in three groups monoclinal anticlinal and synclinal the total lengths for each group being 1333 334 and 245 miles Synclinal ridges are therefore exceptional the length of the monoclinal ridges far exceeding that of the other two classes Synclinal ridges of Pottsville conglomerate in the anthracite coal regions are relatively more common than elsewhere but even there the mono clinal ridge prevails The synclinal valley between two neighboring monoclinal ridges often has a highlevel floor but it is sur mounted and enclosed so distinctly by two ridges that the three forms cannot properly be described as a single synclinal

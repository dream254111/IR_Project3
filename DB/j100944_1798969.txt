FROM NOPtTON SOUND APRIL 27 18684 ling throuobh a country which was utterly spoiled and torn to pieces by the slavetrade He was penetrating into the back provinces of that trade alld he looked to thc Entlish nation to take sorne notice of it The Sultan of Zanzibar was willing to throw himself into the hands of the British Government as an instrument in stopping the slavetrade The traffic was an abomination and ouoPht to be stopped He Mr Waller reooretted that his friend Mr Young was not present to share the joy of the Society in hearinffl of Dr Livingstone s safety All Mr Youngs suoogestions were borne out to the letter by the communications that had been received He Mr Waller mrould not venture to speak of Dr Livinostones future lnovements in the presence of Sir Roderick ZItIrchison to whom he should hellceforth bow as the prophet of Africa If Sir Roderick said that LivinCstone would come ollt on the west coast he Mr VValler would at once crush his idea that he was cominC out at Alexandria He could endorse Sir Samuel Bakers expression of appreciation of that kind ness of heart on the part of the President which had followed African explorers He had been present in Africa when despatches had been opened from Sir Roderick and he could testify to the delight felt by travellers for the kind ness with which he had ever watched ovel them 1he PRESIDEXT in reference to the observations of hIr NValler remarked that Livingstone had on this journey passed througxh countries not troubled by the slavetrade he had seen extensive tracts inhabited by very happy people where the slavetrade was uIlknown Mr Young to whoin the last spealier had alluded had received the unanimous thanks of the Society and he the President had dwelt particularly at the commencement of the evening on the most admirable expedition of Mr Young Withotlt his good conduct of that expedition they would never have been able at that time to expose the lie respectin tlle death of IivinoPstone Captain SI3ERARD OSBORN was prepared as in former days to believe ill LisTinostones success AVith regard to his future course he accepted the first hypothesis enunciated by the President so far as related to the belief that Lake TanoanylSa flowed to the nolth but he was oblioed to diSer from his in SUPPOSiDY that Livinfflstone would turn back to Zanzibar aftel assuring him self of that fact Reviewinox the difficulties he had encountered for the two years previously and findiIlg watercommunication between him and the Nile he thought he woulA be more likely to take to boat and sail on to GondolSoro than to return by land to Zanzibar He Captain Osborn could not conceive that Linntstone would turn to the westward whele there was a huae blmlS of which he was not cognizant If as Mr Findlay believed there were an openinC to the northward hc would probably pass that way in spite of the lifficulties of the route with which he was not unacquainted Ile advocated the notioIl of selldincr an expeditioll tIp the Wila to meet the travellel The following Paper was then read by the Author A Journey frorn Norton Sound Behring Sea to Fort Yokon at the Junction of the Porcpine and Youkorb Pteers By iFrederick WHYMPER Esq THE author stated that the journey was made in the service of the RussoAmerican Telegraph Expedition since abandoned During the winters of 18656 and 18667 there were stations at the Anadyr River and at Plover Bay in Eastern Siberia at Port Clarence and Nortoll Sotlnd and on the glneat Yollkon River in RussianAPEL 27 1868 TO FORT YOUKON 187 America The men were engaged both exploring and erecting the telegraph in a temperature frequently below the freezing point of merury minus58 Fahr was their lowest recorded tem perature in Russian America The asemen in cutting poles found their tools continually losing their edge or cracling into pieces Eealth was mevertheless preserved and the work carried forward throughout the winter Both  Youkon  and Kwichpak pronounced Kwifpak the two names of the river are Indian words signifyint  big river After giving a sketch of the various explorations of the river the author proceeded to narrate that he was attached to the Youkon division of the telegraph party in September 1866 On the 2nd of October he went to Unalacheet in a small steamer fronl Norton Sound the Unalacheet River was then frozen up and ice was forining on the coast On the 7th of October the steamer was beaahed for the winter and he travelled by land and by the frozen Youkon to Nulato where he arrived on the 1 5th of November Nulato is the most interior and northern fort of the RussianAmeritan Fur Company Indians resort hither from a distance of 300 miles to barter their furs as many as a000 martenskins have been brought by them in one year besides other furs During the winter he observed the Indian mode of Eshing through the ice on the Youkon Early in the season large stakes were driven down through the ice to the bottom of the river To these were affixed trapsX consisting simply of a wicker funnel leading into a long basket Oblong holes in the ice aboare them were kept open through fi equent breaking and sometimes a great haul of fish was the result when the traps were raised On the 1 0th of April the willows began to bud on the 28th the first goose arrived frorn the soutll and on the 13th of May swallows were ditting arotlnd the fort The breakllp of the great ri5ter s an interesting sight it made its filst move on the 19th of May a collstant stream of broken ice swept down surging into vast piles grinding and crashing on its way the banks were torn and swept away andfthe water rose 14 feet above its winterlesel On the 26th of SIay Mr WVhymper and Mr Dall commenced their journey up the great streasn 600 miles above its nloulh it was a mile and a quarter 51videX with a current at this season of 6 knots an hour They passed the mouths of many large tributaries and several deep bays and reached NuclukaJTette the furthest point ever reached by the Rnssian furtraders on the 8th of June Beyond this they entered an unexplored part of the river Rhe days now became too hot for travelling  sometimes 78 in the shade and they progressed only during the twilight hours of night The only rapids met with for 1200 miles were a days journey188 JOURNEY TO FORT lOUKON APRIIJ 97 1868 abox e Diuclukayette lout tlley passed tllrouth

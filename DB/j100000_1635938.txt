of this act 1903 100 1904 110 1905 115 1906 100 1907 606 The records are not sufficiently explicit as to the species of Lynx but the loupcervier seems far less common as in only a few cases was the distinction made on the certificate These animals L rufus are sporadically reported from other sections of the state but often from localities that lead to the suspicion that they may have immi grated from the western hilly or mountainous parts C E GORDON MASSACHUSETTS AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE SOCIETIES AND ACADEMIES THE PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON THE 652d meeting was held on October 10 1908 President Bauer presiding The following papers were presented Vertical Temperature Gradients of the Upper Atmosphere Mr W J HUMPHREYS The extensive work that has been done during the past ten years in exploring the air with sound ing balloons was reviewed and illustrated with typical curves The records obtained with these balloons show that for about 3000 meters above the surface of the earth the winds are turbulent and the tem perature gradient irregular Above this for some distance the temperature decreases nearly uni formly to a minimum at an altitude of from nine to fifteen kilometers usually This height and the temperature both are functions of season of lati tude and of type of weather and the temperature gradient is similarly affected Above the minimum the temperature gradient usually changes abruptly and from that point up as far as soundings have been made slowly in creases All these phenomena were separately discussed and explained as mainly due to the amount and distribution of water vapor in the atmosphere and the consequent location and temperature of the effective radiating surface of the earth The results are in accord with the best deter minations of the solar constant and with the known laws of radiation and absorption  Personal letter Mr Henry Brewster treasurer of Berkshire County The New Magnetic Survey Yacht Carnegie Mr W J PETERS A paper on the proposed new vessel designed fer a continuation of the magnetic survey of the oceanic areas The paper first gave the reasons which made it desirable to purchase a vessel especially built for the requirements of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution of Wash ington Then followed data concerning the size sail area and expected performances A brief description of the living quarters ac companied by slides and also a statement of the methods of observation which are to be on the lines followed in the previous work on the Galilee in the Pacific Ocean There was also exhibited a graphic representa tion of the curves of expected maximum ship deviations A more complete publication will appear elsewhere THE 653d meeting was held October 24 1908 The following papers were read The Results of Recent Observations in Atmos pherio Electricity Mr P H DIKE The paper gave a summary of some of the recent work in atmospheric electricity and showed the relationship of this work to that done along the same lines on board the Carnegie Institution Magnetic Survey Yacht Galilee during the cruise recently finished Continuous records made at various observa tories of the course of the potential gradient show its extreme variability and slight apparent con nection with other atmospheric phenomena It is of interest as a factor in the determination of the earthair current The discovery of the ionization of gases led to the study of the conductivity of the air at first by faulty methods through the lack of apprecia tion of the errors due to saturation currents J J Thomson cleared up the misunderstandings and led the way to more accurate work For field work the Gerdien conductivity apparatus has been found most useful and gives fairly consistent results In conjunction with the record of the potential gradient it gives the earthair current in absolute measure Gerdien has found this current at Gottingen to be about 25 X 1016 amperes with a conductivity for positive electricity of 116 X 104 electrostatic units and for negative of 112 X 104 electrostatic units The speaker had made use of the same type of SCIENCB 775N S VOL XXVIII No 726 instrument on board the Galilee making observa tions at sea from latitude 55 41 north to 45 07 south but was unable to measure the potential gradient The conductivities found gave as means Xp  160 X 104 and Xn 1433 X 104 electro static units somewhat greater than Gerdien found on land A description of the method of observa tion at sea was given and the difficulties men tioned Calibrations ot the electroscope in New Zealand and at the Bureau of Standards in Wash ington showed its sensitiveness to be nearly con stant but gradually increasing C T R Wilsons method of measuring the earthair current was described He uses a test plate maintained at zero potential while insulated from the earth and arrives at a value for the current almost identical with that of Gerdien namely 22 X 1018 amperes Mention was made of Scherings work in Gittingen on the continuous registration of the conductivity of the atmosphere and his apparatus described He avoids satura tion currents by removing the charged body to a sufficient distance from earthed conductors and obtained a trace showing the course of the con ductivity by means of an electrometer connected with the charged body Satterly at the Cavendish Laboratory Cam bridge Eve at Montreal and Ashman at the Uni versity of Chicago have all made independent determinations of the quantity of radioactive emanation in the atmosphere in terms of the mass of radium per cubic meter required to maintain in equilibrium the observed amount of emanation Ashman condensed the emanation by cooling with liquid air Eve absorbed it with cocoanut charcoal and Satterly used both methods The results give as the radium equivalent per cubic meter according to Ashman 97 X 1012 gram Eve 60 X 1012 gram from results extending over a year and with a ratio of maximum to minimum of 7 to 1 and Satterly 88 X 1012 gram for the charcoal method and over 100 X 1012 for the liquidair method On board the Galilee practically no radioactive deposit could be collected yet the ionization was as great as on land tending to disprove the theory that the ionization of the air is due to the radio active content Attention was called to the need for a well equipped observatory for research along these lines in this country where the subject has been almost entirely neglected Thermometric Lag in Calorimetry Mr W P TWHIITE Of late in calorimetry by the method of mix tures several attempts have been made to avoid an error due to the lag of the thermometer to which considerable importance has been attached This error however does not exist at all which may be shown as follows In a calorimetric run by the method of mixtures all the temperature data lie upon a temperaturetime curve whose form determines both the cooling correction and the main temperature interval The exact in stant at which temperatures on this curve are read is unimportant so long as the temperature intervals are preserved If now all temperatures are plotted the same number of seconds wrong as they would be when the same lagging ther mometer is used throughout no appreciable error can result The importance of lag in calorimetric thermometers has therefore been greatly over estimated R L FARIS Secretary THE ELISHA MITCHELL SCIENTIFIC SOCIETY OF THE UNIVERSITY OF NORTH CAROLINA THE 179th meeting of the society was held in Chemistry Hall on Tuesday October 13 1908 730 PM The program was as follows Results of the Microscopic Study of the Slate near Chapel Hill Mr H N Eaton Chemical Energy Professor J E Mills A Further Contribution on the Regenerative Power of Sponges Professor H V Wilson ALVIN S WHEELER Recording Secretary SECTION OF BIOLOGY PITTSBURGH ACADEMY OF SCIENCE AND ART THE first meeting of the year was held at the Carnegie Institute on Tuesday evening November 10 At the invitation of the section about twenty five geologists attended the meeting and it was decided that there was sufficient interest mani fested to warrant the formation of a Geological Section in Pittsburgh As the Biological Section had already prepared a program which embraced a large number of topics of interest to geologists it was thought best to combine the two sections for the present year at least The meeting was addressed by Director W J Holland Dean M E Wadsworth Mr R R Hice Mr F Hewett Mr F Z Schellenberg Mr E Andrews Mr F S Webster Professor J G Ogden

horizontal cleavage occurs the lower cells resulting from this division re tain their continuity with the yolk as has been described by Kowalewski Hoffman and Berent Teleosts and Dean Ganoids These partial cells merocytes continue to divide by mitosis both horizontally and ver tically In the former case the upper of the products of division is added to the germdisc This process of supplementary cleavage continues until a late segmentation stage cells being added to the whole lower surface of the germdisc 4 The periblast arises from the resid ual portion of the merocytes after supple mentary cleavage has ceased being thicker under the margin of the germdisc but present elsewhere from the beginning 5 The periblast is trophic in its function playing only an indirect part in cellforma tion Normal mitosis soon gives place to abnormal and this in turn to amitosis Transitional forms occur 6 The subgerminal space segmentation cavity does not appear till about time of origin of germring At close of segmenta tion yolk and blastodisc are in close con tact in wellpreserved specimens although no longer continuous with one another Clefts which early appear between blasto meres or below them are probably artifacts If not they disappear later 7 The germring mesentoderm arises primarily as a marginal ingrowth due to cellproliferation from germwall Rand wulst The germring also receives abun dant additions from the overlying primary germlayer even at considerable distance from the periphery See Reinhard Arch f Mikr Anat 1898 8 The whole germring extraembryonic as well as embryonic contains both ento dermal and mesodermal elements contra H V Wilson and Samassa 9 Kupffers vesicle arises as in the Salmonide as a cavity completely shut in by cells from the first It is at first much compressed horizontally and distinctly bi lobed In embryos with a short tail it is still to be seen near tip of the latter strongly suggesting neurenteric canal of Selachii A second vesicle situated in yolk under the posterior end of the embryo appears slightly in advance of Kupffers vesicle and reaches a size exceeding the latter It is bounded by periblast and perhaps contains more fluid yolk for service of the growing end of em bryo Respiratory and Breeding Habits of Polypterus Bichir N R HARRINGTON ON physiological grounds Polypterus is as fully qualified for a lungfish  as are any of the Dipnoans it has also striking resem blances in its circulatory and respiratory system to the Urodela These points were demonstrated by means of mounted prepara tions the injecting of which had been done in the field principally by Dr Reid Hunt Beside the bloodsupply to the lungs which is from the last branchial arch the dissections showed the very large glottis or ductus pneumaticus by which the lungs open ventrally from the cesophagus Un like the swimmingbladder of fishes in an other respect both the lungs are entirely invested with peritoneum although one of them the right does occupy the normal position for an airbladder viz between the aorta and kidneys on the one hand and the alimentary canal on the other The mesentery however in which the left lobe should be suspended has almost entirely degenerated and this somewhat smaller lobe lies entirely free in the bodycavity It was pointed out that while the strong est disproof of the Dipnoan ancestry of the Amphibia lies in the paleontological evi dence which indicates that they are a par allel line the same conclusion may be in 314 SCIENCESCIENCE ferred from the life habits of a form which encysts during periods of drought For the ability to undergo suspended anima tion necessitates such specialization that it is improbable that evolution operated through such an encysting form which is absolutely helpless and inactive until it is set free into the water in bringing about a vertebrate which breathed air the year around Reference was also made to the breeding habits of Polypterus and an accessory copula tory organ in the malea modified anal fin was described The breeding season fol lows the inundation of the Nile The general collections some of which were exhibited brought back by the Senff zoological expedition are intended for general distribution to qualified investiga tors who can work up the material within a reasonably short time Aside from a large collection of Nile fishes there is ma terial preserved for researches in embryol ogy electric organs pseudoelectric organs neurology and Plankton The Coronary Vessels in the Hearts of Fishes G H PARKER and F K DAVIS THE muscular substance of the heart in mammals receives its blood from a pair of coronary arteries which connect with coronary veins opening into the right auricle The inner surfaces of the four chambers of the mammalian heart have upon them openings which lead into vessels connecting with the coronary capillaries and especially with the veins These ves sels are the veins of Thebesius Is there a similar system of vessels in fishes Cor onary arteries were identified in the com mon skate the sand shark and the mud fish Amia In the skate they may come from various combinations of the efferent branchial arteries of the second to the fifth gill cleft in the sand shark from combina tions reaching from the first to the fifth 315 clefts in the mudfish from the second bran chial arch In these three species coronary veins occur all of which open into the venous sinus On inflating these bubbling was observed from the natural inner sur faces of the auricles and sometimes from those of the ventricles These fishes there fore have veins of Thebesius Longitudinal Fission in Metridium margina tum G H PARKER TEN animals with double mouths were studied Two had each two mouths on one oral disc and the pedal ends of their cesophageal tubes were united Eight had each completely separate oral discs and cesophageal tubes In six the mouths were monoglyphic in three one mouth was imon oglyphic and one diglyphic and in one one mouth was monoglyphic and one aglyphic There were about twice as many pairs of complete mesenteries as in single mouthed individuals Double specimens are not the result of fusion for the two partial indi viduals are strikingly similar in color etc a condition unlikely of occurrence in chance combinations of so variable a species They may be monstrosities or dividing animals One specimen nearly divided was kept un der observation two months but showed no advance in the process In good collecting localities isolated pairs agreeing in color marking and sex may be found This evidence favors the view that M margina tur reproduces by longitudinal fission a process slowly accomplished but it does not exclude the possibility of some double speci mens being monstrosities Additional Characters of Diplodocus HENRY F OSBORN THIS is one of the three types of herbivo rous Sauropoda or Cetiosauria represented by a very cponsiderable portion of the skele ton of one individual found by Barnum Brown and the writer in 1897 The scapula ilium ischium and femur are associated with MARCH 3 1899

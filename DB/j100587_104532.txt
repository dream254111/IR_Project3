French by T Stack M D F R S S I R F O R several Years past Electricity has been my chief Occupation Last Summer I read three Memoirs at our weekly Meet ings which contained many Particulars on this Sub ject But as these were Matters of mere Curiosity and of no real Use they almost tired out my Pa tience I now send you some Experiments which I made during the Vacation which seem to pro mise at least the being of some Service but of this you will be the best Judge I will describe them in the same Order as I made them and to which I was not led by mere Accident You know that when a Vessel full of Liquor which runs out through a Pipe is electrified the electrified Jet or Stream is thrown farther than usual and is diverged into se veral divergent Rays much in the same manner as the Water poured out from a watering Pot Every body at first Sight will judge that the Stream is accelerated and that the electrified Vessel will soon be empty I was unwilling to rely on the first Appearances and therefore re solved to ascertain the Fact by measuring the Time and the Quantity of the Liquor running out B b And Read Feb 11 17478188 And in order to know if the Acceleration suppo sing there was any was uniform during the whole Time of the running out I made use of Vessels of different Capacities terminating in Pipes of differ ent Bores from three Lines Diameter to the smallest Capillaries And I give you in gross the Result of upwards of an hundred Experiments as it is not so easy a Task to draw a safe Conclusion as may at first be imagined 1 The electrified Stream tho it divides and carries the Liquid farther is neither accelerated nor re tarded sensibly when the Pipe thro which it is sues is not less than a Line in Diameter 2 Under this Diameter if the Tube is wide enough to let the Liquid run in a continued Stream the Electricity accelerates it a little but less than a Person would believe if he judged by the Num ber of Jets that are formed and by the Distance to which it shoots 3 If the Tube is a capillary one from which the Water ought naturally to flow but only Drop by Drop the electrified Jet not only becomes conti nued and divided into several but is also consi derably accelerated and the smaller the capillary Tube is the greater in proportion is this Accele ration 4 And so great is the Effect of the electrical Vir tue that it drives the Liquid out of a very small capillary Tube thro which it had not before the Force to pass and enables it to run out in Cases where there would not otherwise have been any Discharge These189 These last Facts have served as a Basis to my In quiries I considerd all organized Bodies as Assem blages of capillary Tubes filled with a Fluid that tends to run thro them and often to issue out of them In consequence of this Idea I imagined that the electrical Virtue might possibly communicate some Motion to the Sap of Vegetables and also augment the insensible Perspiration of Animals I began by some Experiments the Result of which confirmd my Notions I electrified for four or five Hours together Fruits green Plants and Sponges dippd in Water which I had carefully weighd and I found that after this Experiment all these Bodies were remarkably lighter than others of the same kind weighd with them both before and af ter the Experiment and kept in the same Place and temper I also electrified Liquors of all sorts in open Vessels and I remarked that the Electrifi cation augmented their Evaporation in some more in others less according to their different Natures Wherefore I took two GardenPots filled with the same Earth and sowed with the same Seeds I kept them constantly in the same Place and took the same Care of them except that one of the two was electrified for fifteen Days running for two or three and sometimes four Hours a Day This Pot always shewed its Seeds raised two or three Days sooner than the other a greater Number of Shoots and those longer in a given Time Which makes me believe that the electrical Virtue helps to open and display the Germs and facilitates the Growth of Plants I advance this however only as a Con Bb 2 jecture190 jecture which deserves further Confirmation as the Season was already too far advanced to allow me to make as many Experiments as I could have wishd But here are yet other Facts of which I have a greater Certainty and which are not less in teresting I chose several Pairs of Animals of different kinds Cats Pigeons Chaffinches Sparrows c I put them all into separate wooden Cages and then weighed them I electrified one of each Pair for five or six Hours together Then I weighed them again The Cat was commonly 65 or 70 Grains lighter than the other the Pigeon from 35 to 38 Grains the Chaffinch and Sparrow 6 or 7 Grains And in or der to have nothing to charge upon the Difference that might arise from the Temperament of the Indi vidual I again repeated the same Experiments by electrifying that Animal of each Pair which had not been electrified before and notwithstanding some small Varieties which happend the electrified Ani mal was constantly lighter than the other in propor tion Electricity therefore increases the insensible Per spiration of Animals But in what Proportion In the Ratio of their Bulks or in that of their Sur faces Neither of the one or the other strictly speaking but in a Ratio much more approaching to the latter than to the former So that there is no Room to apprehend that a human Person elec trified would lose near a 50th Part of his Weight as it appeard to me that it happend to one sort of Bird nor the 140th Part as to the Pigeon c All that I have been hitherto able to learn upon this Head is191 is that a young Man or Woman from 20 to 30 being electrified during five Hours lost several Ounces of their Weight more than they were wont to lose when they were not electrified These last Experiments are difficult to pursue with Exactness because the Cloathing which cannot strictly be com pared to the Hair or Feathers of Animals retains a good Share of the perspired Matter and hinders one from forming a good Judgment of the whole Effect of the electrical Virtue This forced electric Perspiration is very naturally accounted for if we consider that the electrical Matter pervades the interior Parts of Bodies and that it visibly darts from within outward For it is very plain that these electrical Emanations must carry with them whatever they find in the small Vessels thro which they are seen or at least are known to issue This Explanation will in my Opinion occur to every one who has seen the principal Phaenomena of Electricity But how shall we account for all the following Effects All those Animals whose Per spiration is increased upon their being electrified all those Seeds which shoot and grow quicker all those Liquors which evaporate all that Accelera tion of Liquids flowing thro Tubes all those Par ticulars I say happen in the same manner when instead of electrifying those Bodies themselves they are only held near electrical Bodies of a pretty large Bulk The Notion which I have for these three Years past formed of Electricity not only affords me an Explication of this as simple as the former but I venture to say it was this same Notion that led192 led me to the Experiments and made me even foresee their Success I am not only satisfied of the Existence of an ef fluent electric Matter which all the World allows and which shews itself a thousand Ways but many convincing Reasons have also assured me that there is round every electrified Body an affluent Matter which comes to it not only from the ambient Air but likewise from all the other Bodies whether so lid or fluid that are round about and within a certain Distance of it If these surrounding Bodies are of a simple Nature as a Stone a Piece of Iron c nothing issues from them but pure electrical Matter But if they are Animals Plants or Fruits or in a Word any organized Bodies or such in the Pores of which there is any Substance capable of giving way to the Impulses of the electric Matter this Matter will in issuing forth with the great Ra pidity which it is known to have carry along with it whatever it finds moveable enough to be displaced by it and by so much will the Weight of the Body be diminished the same Effect being here produced by the affluent Matter as is produced on electrified Bodies by the effluent If you will please to read over my Essay what I advance will be better under stood The Increase or Diminution of Perspiration is not a Matter of Indifference to the animal Oeconomy This new Method of increasing it at Will may possibly prove of Use it is neither inconvenient nor danger ous and neither I myself nor any body else of those on whom I made my Experiments suffered even the least Inconveniency from it One feels neither Mo tion nor Heat differing from that of the natural State 4193 State Nor did the Animals give any Signs of Un easiness while they were electrifying A little Wea riness and a better Appetite were the only Effects we ever perceived As to the Facility of applying this Method tis well known that the electrical Virtue is easily trans mitted a good way off by Chains etc and one may easily imagine that an easy Chair or even a Bed sus pended or supported in a proper manner will put the most infirm Persons in a Situation to be very com modiously electrified But as there is no Necessity to electrify them actually it will become easier still for nothing more will be requisite than to place near them a Basket of old Iron renderd electrical The commonest Degree of Sagacity will suffice to put this Method in Practice whenever it is found to be useful I shall observe further that when I electrify an Ani mal I render his Perspiration more copious and this Effect is universal thro every Part of it When I only place it near an electrified Body it perspires as much But is its whole Body equally sensible of this Effect I mean what exhales in consequence of the Electricity does it issue from every Part of his Surface I believe it does not and that for these Reasons If it be the electrical Matter of the Skin that drives out the Matter of Perspiration by rushing towards the electrified Body it is natural to think that this Ef fect takes place only in the Part out of which the elec trical Matter issues Thus the Perspiration which is electrically forced out ought to issue from those Parts only which are the most directly applied toward the electrical Body Let us confirm this by Experiments To194 To an electrified Body I apply a Vessel full of Li quor which issues Drop by Drop thro several little Tubes placed in different Parts of its Circumference These Drops become continued Streams and are ac celerated as if the Vessel had been electrified But this Effect is observable on that Side only which faces the electrified Body I moisten a thick Sponge with Water and cut it in two I weigh these two Halves separately I join them again and place the whole near a large electrified Body so as to make one Half of the Sponge face the Body directly and the other the contrary Way Af ter an Electrification of five or six Hours that Half which faced the electric Body was found to be lighter than the other etc Wherefore I think I have good Grounds to believe that a Man who presents a Shoulder or one Side of his Head to a large electrified Body perspires more thro that Part than thro any other Add to this that since these Animals which I caused to perspire in this last manner and which had but one Side of their Bodies exposed to the Electricity lost as much of their Weight as the others which were throughly electrified it follows that they perspired as plentifully thro the exposed Part as the others thro the whole Body Whence we may infer that of the two Methods which I propose for augmenting insensible Perspira tion the latter is the most powerful and most proper to remove Obstructions from the Pores or to scour them of any noxious Humours which they may hap pen to contain I have the Honour to be with the greatest Respect Sir Your most humble and most obedient Setvant The Abbe Nollet XI

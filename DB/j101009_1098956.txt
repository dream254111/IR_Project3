should be addressed to the EDITOR at University Station Charlottesville Va BUSINESS communications to the PUB LISHERS OUR attention has been called to a palpable error in the editorial notice of the case of Singafus v Porter in our December number p 571 The statement is made that the proper measure of damages for a breach of warranty of quality on the sale of a chattel is the  differ ence between the contract price and the reasonable market value of the property had the warranty been true The measure of damages should have been stated to be of course the difference between the actual value of the thing as delivered and the value it would have possessed had it answered to the warranty In such case the contract price is generally immaterial See 1 Va Law Reg 470 WITH the close of Volume XII Mr H W Fuller announces his retirement as editor of the Green Bag a position which he has filled most acceptably to the readers of that entertaining journal since its inception The REGISTER contemplates Mr Fullers retirement with cordial regret and while congratulating him upon his wellearned rest not less heartily than upon his successful conduct of the magazine it begs to assure him that he has prolonged the life and added to the avoirdupois of more lawyers than he wots of by the entertainment with which he has provided them from month to month Mr Fuller is succeeded by Mr Thomas Tileston Baldwinwhose surname suggests Flush Times and promises well as a purveyor of the humorous in the law IN Chapin v Fye 21 Sup Ct 71 the defendant on the trial in the State court meaning to raise the question of whether the State statute upon which the plaintiffs claim was based did not deprive the defendant of his property without due process of law based his conten tion on the  due process of law  clause in the 5th Amendment to theConstitution of the United States instead of the same clause in the 14th Amendment The Supreme Court of the United States held in what appears to be an extremely technical ruling that as the 5th Amendment operates only on the Federal courts the constitutionality of the statute was not properly raised in the State court and that the defendant could not afterwardss on appeal to the Supreme Court rely upon the same clause in the 14th Amendment Mr Justice Brown dissented IN Chesapeake  Ohio Railway Co v Dixon 21 Sup Ct 67 it was held that an action in a State court for personal injuries against a railroad company incorporated under the laws of another State could not be removed by the railroad company to a Federal court where the engineer and fireman whose alleged negligence caused the injury were united as codefendants and were citizens of the State in which the action was brought It is unusual in personal injury cases against railroad companies to unite the negligent employees but as the servant whose negligence caused the injury is equally liable with the master the plaintiff may at his election sue either or both and when he thus elects to sue both the action becomes joint against both and as held by the court there is no separable controversy Hence it follows that as the whole con troversy cannot be removed to the Federal court by reason of some of the defendants being citizens of the same State with the plaintiff the Federal court has no jurisdiction on the ground of diverse citizen ship of any part of it Mr Justice Harlan and Mr Justice White dissented The plaintiff probably united the employees as codefendants for the purpose of preventing a removal to the Federal court and the successful result will doubtless revolutionize the practice in tort actions against foreign corporations in the State courts THE case of Dingus v Minneapolis Improvement Co recently de cided by the Supreme Court of Virginia 2 Va Sup Ct Rep 604 affords a striking illustration of the principle several times announced by the same court that in the absence of statutory enactments a cred itor can subject only the actual interest of his debtor to the lien of a judgment Expressed otherwise the judgment creditor is in no sense a purchaser and in the absence of statute or of fraud is generally bound by all the equities affecting the debtorin effect standing in 1901  645 EDITORIAL6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER his shoes It was upon this principle that the celebrated case of Floyd v Harding 28 Gratt 401 was based The precise point there estab lished was that where a purchaser of real estate failed to record his conveyance whereby subsequent judgments against his grantor took priority over it he might yet repel the judgment creditors by proof of a previous parol contract followed by possession and payment of the purchase money before the recovery of the judgments Such an ex ecutory contract was not required by the statute to be recorded and being specifically enforceable against the vendor by reason of posses sion taken and purchase money paid such unwritten and unrecorded equity in the vendee was held equally binding upon the judgment creditors of the vendor The facts in the Dingus case are somewhat complicated but in sub stance were these 1 Banner conveyed to Rosser certain real estate by a deed abso lute on its face There was however a contemporaneous written agreement creating Rosser who was the president of several land com panies engaged in booming the land in question a trustee for the joint benefit of himself and Banner Rosser undertaking to handle the property for their joint benefit 2 Subsequently and as a part of the plan of operations Rosser for a nominal consideration conveyed the property to A Co of which he was presidentthe company having full knowledge of all the cir cumstancesand that company shortly afterwards conveyed the prop erty to B Co of which Rosser was also president and which was organized for the especial purpose of furthering the booming  plans of Rosser and his associates The last named company was cognizant of Banners equitable interest at the time of this conveyance At this point therefore the legal title was in the B Co which held it subject to the trust in Banners favor 3 Subsequently Banner conveyed his entire equitable interest in the property to Rosser individually but in fact acting for the B Co  this conveyance reciting a cancellation and release of the previous col lateral contract and a purchase of the entire property by Rosser from Banner at 90000 and Banner retained a vendors lien on the equi table interest thus conveyed to secure the deferred installments of purchase money 4 All of the foregoing conveyances were duly recorded 5 Subsequently the B Cowhich had assumed and paid a large 646 Janpart of the purchase money due to Banner under the last mentioned conveyance to Rosser its presidententered into a compromise with Banner under which the latter agreed to accept in full payment of the balance of his unpaid purchase money all of the original tract remaining unsold to purchasers of lots into which it had been divided In pursuance of this agreement the B Co conveyed the remainder to Banner thereby reinvesting him with the legal title 6 Before Banner placed this last deed of record judgments were recorded and docketed against his grantor the B Co and a bill was filed to subject the land to the payment thereof The contest was therefore between Banner and the judgment cred itors of his grantor the B Co The creditors contended that by fail ure to record the conveyance from the B Coa conveyance which they asserted settled and merged all previous claims and negotiations their judgments become a lien on the property prior to any claim of Banner The court held however very properly that while the conveyance was void as to the creditors of the B Co because of nonrecordation there was a previous equity still existing in Banner upon which he might rely namely his claim for the unpaid purchase money secured by a vendors lien reserved on the equitable interest conveyed to Rosser acting for the B Co This equitable lien though at law merged in the subsequent transaction by which Banner acquired the legal title in express satisfaction of the equitable lien the court properly treated as still subsisting for the protection of Bannerjust as in Floyd v Hardirg supra the previous equity of the purchase arising frorn taking possession and paying the purchase money was held not to have been merged in a subsequent conveyance from the vendor to the vendee which by reason of nonrecordation was void as to the judg ment creditors of the grantor The same principle is illustrated in Borst v Nalle 28 Gratt 423 where judgments against the holder of the legal title were held not to be liens as against one who showed himself to be the real owner under operation of a resulting trust established by parol As indicated by the facts stated the principal case was one of un usual complications but the conclusions are carefully worked out by Cardwell J and seem to meet the justice of the case viewed either from a legal or a moral standpoint 1901  647 EDITORIAL

FIREMAN WHOSE ALLEGED NEGLIGENCE CAUSED THE INJURY WERE UNITED AS CODEFENDANTS AND WERE CITIZENS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THE ACTION WAS BROUGHT IT IS UNUSUAL IN PERSONAL INJURY CASES AGAINST RAILROAD COMPANIES TO UNITE THE NEGLIGENT EMPLOYEES BUT AS THE SERVANT WHOSE NEGLIGENCE CAUSED THE INJURY IS EQUALLY LIABLE WITH THE MASTER THE PLAINTIFF MAY AT HIS ELECTION SUE EITHER OR BOTH AND WHEN HE THUS ELECTS TO SUE BOTH THE ACTION BECOMES JOINT AGAINST BOTH AND AS HELD BY THE COURT THERE IS NO SEPARABLE CONTROVERSY HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT AS THE WHOLE CON TROVERSY CANNOT BE REMOVED TO THE FEDERAL

DEBTORIN EFFECT STANDING IN 1901  645 EDITORIAL6 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER HIS SHOES IT WAS UPON THIS PRINCIPLE THAT THE CELEBRATED CASE OF FLOYD V HARDING 28 GRATT 401 WAS BASED THE PRECISE POINT THERE ESTAB LISHED WAS THAT WHERE A PURCHASER OF REAL ESTATE FAILED TO RECORD HIS CONVEYANCE WHEREBY SUBSEQUENT JUDGMENTS AGAINST HIS GRANTOR TOOK PRIORITY OVER IT HE MIGHT YET REPEL THE JUDGMENT CREDITORS BY PROOF OF A PREVIOUS PAROL CONTRACT FOLLOWED BY POSSESSION AND PAYMENT OF THE PURCHASE MONEY BEFORE THE RECOVERY OF THE JUDGMENTS SUCH AN EX ECUTORY CONTRACT WAS NOT REQUIRED BY THE STATUTE TO BE RECORDED AND BEING SPECIFICALLY ENFORCEABLE AGAINST THE VENDOR BY REASON OF POSSES SION TAKEN AND PURCHASE MONEY PAID SUCH UNWRITTEN AND UNRECORDED EQUITY IN THE VENDEE WAS HELD EQUALLY BINDING UPON THE JUDGMENT CREDITORS OF THE VENDOR THE FACTS IN THE DINGUS CASE ARE SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED BUT IN SUB STANCE WERE THESE 1 BANNER CONVEYED TO ROSSER CERTAIN REAL ESTATE BY A DEED ABSO LUTE ON ITS FACE THERE WAS HOWEVER A CONTEMPORANEOUS WRITTEN AGREEMENT CREATING ROSSER WHO WAS THE PRESIDENT OF SEVERAL LAND COM PANIES ENGAGED IN BOOMING THE LAND IN QUESTION A TRUSTEE FOR THE JOINT BENEFIT OF

A CO OF WHICH HE WAS PRESIDENTTHE COMPANY HAVING FULL KNOWLEDGE OF ALL THE CIR CUMSTANCESAND THAT COMPANY SHORTLY AFTERWARDS CONVEYED THE PROP ERTY TO B CO OF WHICH ROSSER WAS ALSO PRESIDENT AND WHICH WAS ORGANIZED FOR THE ESPECIAL PURPOSE OF FURTHERING THE BOOMING  PLANS OF ROSSER AND HIS ASSOCIATES THE LAST NAMED COMPANY WAS COGNIZANT OF BANNERS EQUITABLE INTEREST AT THE TIME OF THIS CONVEYANCE AT THIS POINT THEREFORE THE LEGAL TITLE WAS IN THE B CO WHICH HELD IT SUBJECT TO THE TRUST IN BANNERS FAVOR 3 SUBSEQUENTLY BANNER CONVEYED HIS ENTIRE EQUITABLE INTEREST IN THE PROPERTY TO ROSSER INDIVIDUALLY BUT IN FACT ACTING FOR THE B CO  THIS CONVEYANCE RECITING A CANCELLATION AND RELEASE OF THE PREVIOUS COL LATERAL CONTRACT AND A PURCHASE OF THE ENTIRE PROPERTY BY ROSSER FROM BANNER AT

CONTENDED THAT BY FAIL URE TO RECORD THE CONVEYANCE FROM THE B COA CONVEYANCE WHICH THEY ASSERTED SETTLED AND MERGED ALL PREVIOUS CLAIMS AND NEGOTIATIONS THEIR JUDGMENTS BECOME A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY PRIOR TO ANY CLAIM OF BANNER THE COURT HELD HOWEVER VERY PROPERLY THAT WHILE THE CONVEYANCE WAS VOID AS TO THE CREDITORS OF THE B CO BECAUSE OF NONRECORDATION THERE WAS A PREVIOUS EQUITY STILL EXISTING IN BANNER UPON WHICH HE MIGHT RELY NAMELY HIS CLAIM FOR THE UNPAID PURCHASE MONEY SECURED BY A VENDORS LIEN RESERVED ON THE EQUITABLE INTEREST CONVEYED TO ROSSER ACTING FOR THE B CO THIS EQUITABLE LIEN THOUGH AT LAW MERGED IN THE SUBSEQUENT TRANSACTION BY WHICH BANNER ACQUIRED THE LEGAL TITLE IN EXPRESS SATISFACTION OF THE EQUITABLE LIEN THE COURT PROPERLY TREATED AS STILL SUBSISTING FOR THE PROTECTION OF BANNERJUST AS IN FLOYD V HARDIRG SUPRA THE PREVIOUS EQUITY OF THE PURCHASE ARISING FRORN TAKING POSSESSION AND PAYING THE PURCHASE MONEY WAS HELD NOT TO HAVE BEEN MERGED IN A SUBSEQUENT CONVEYANCE FROM THE VENDOR TO THE VENDEE WHICH BY REASON OF NONRECORDATION WAS VOID AS TO THE JUDG MENT CREDITORS OF THE GRANTOR THE SAME PRINCIPLE IS ILLUSTRATED IN BORST V NALLE 28 GRATT 423 WHERE JUDGMENTS AGAINST THE HOLDER OF THE LEGAL TITLE WERE HELD NOT TO BE LIENS AS AGAINST ONE WHO SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE THE REAL OWNER UNDER OPERATION OF A RESULTING TRUST ESTABLISHED BY PAROL AS INDICATED BY THE FACTS STATED THE PRINCIPAL CASE WAS ONE OF UN USUAL COMPLICATIONS BUT THE CONCLUSIONS ARE CAREFULLY WORKED OUT BY CARDWELL J AND SEEM TO MEET THE JUSTICE OF THE CASE VIEWED EITHER

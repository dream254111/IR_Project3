needles ready to topple over at the slightest touch Outwardly this sheet of instability appears firm and compact Dur ing the period of rotting the temperature of maximum density is slowly advancing up wards towards the ice sheet Below the sur face of maximum density convection of heat brings more and more warm water up from the bottom There must be then a definite surface in the water at 4 C below which the temperature is kept fairly uniform by convection and above which there is no move ment in the water to disturb the existing temperature gradient up to the ice sheet As soon as the 4 surface reaches the under side of the already honeycombed ice the change of temperature and movement of water must be fairly sudden causing a rapid collapse of the whole structure This no doubt accounts for the characteristic rattling noise when the phenomenon takes place The ice needles soon melt in the warm water which gives rise to the general belief that the ice sinks H T BARNES McGILL UNIVERSITY April 16 1910 PLANKTON THE article of Professor Chas E Wood ruff in SCIENCE of April 22 recalled to me ob servations I had made of phosphorescence of the sea In connection with astronomic work I have sailed many seas and have circumnavi gated the globe in completing its astronomical girdle in longitude In the waters along southeastern Alaska an area of fog rain and little sunshine I had observed most exquisite phosphorescence of the sea When being rowed from the govern ment steamer ashore every dip of the oars showed them surrounded by that delicate bluish light of phosphorescence When I walked over the beach of the receded tide every footprint was a blaze of this same light Some years subsequently when I started on my work round the world I looked forward with pleasure to beholding the grand phos phorescence of the tropics under the belief that in the warmer waters and bright sunshine the planktonthe cause of the phosphorescencewould be more densely dis tributed In this however I was sadly disap pointed In none of the tropical seas did I see any phosphorescence that could at all compare with what I described above In vain have I stood at night at the bow or side of the steamer on a smooth sea watching for a fine display of phosphorescence Now and then the comb of the small wave as the vessel parted the waters showed a fringe of the bluish light and nothing more Arrhenius in his Lehrbuch der Kos mischen Physik p 376 says that the phos phorescence of the sea is most beautifully developed in the tropics which is not my ex perience Major Woodruffs explanation and application to the tropics of the destruc tive and lethal effect of light on the plankton agrees very well with my observations on the phosphorescence of the sea in different parts of the world OTTO KLOTZ OBSERVATORY OTTAWA April 28 1910 ATHANASIUS KIRCHER AND THE GERM THEORY OF DISEASE IN reference to Dr Rileys note in SCIENCE for April 29 I am glad to make a prompt amende honorable for a hasty error of com mission in regard to the magnifying power of Leeuwenhoeks microscopes but it is difficult to see how any injustice has been done to Athanasius Kircher thereby since the quality of his magnifying glass seems principally a matter of conjecture If we accept Oslers ad justment of the matter of priority in the bac terial theory of infectious diseases then the medical fame of the remarkable priest who was also a mathematician physicist optician pathologist Orientalist musician and virtu oso rests rather upon his seven experiments upon the nature of putrefaction1 than upon his

published in Rome in 1658 at least sev enteen years before Leeuwenhoeks discovery of the infusoria 1675 and twentyfive years before his Royal Society paper on the micro organisms found on the teeth September 17 1683 so that making every allowance for the skill and proficiency of seventeenth century opticians in grinding and polishing lenses the question whether Kirchers lenses were better or worse than Leeuwenhoeks is one of those improbable problems that each one can settle according to his personal prefer ences No one will deny that Kircher saw some minute organisms under his glass but my quotation from Puschmanns Hand buch  to the effect that this glass was only a 32power at best  was I think taken from a most authoritative source Loefflers Vor lesungen and certainly between this state ment and Kirchers own romantic assertion that his lenses magnified a thousandfold there is opportunity for extreme latitude of opinion If Kirchers microscope still exists say in the Vatican collection or any other collection left by him the point might perhaps be settled by having the lenses examined Leeuwenhoeks paper of 16833 contains what appear to be accurate figurations of chains of bacilli as well as of individual spirilli and bacilli and I am informed by a competent bacteriologist that it would be perfectly pos sible to see such chains and clumps with an occasional motile specimen through a glass of the power specified by Dr RiTey All honor then to the father of microscopy who if he saw bacteria without staining methods 2Ibid 29 3A Leeuwenhock Ontledingen en Ontdek

But neither the nota tions of Leeuwenhoek nor the labors of Miiller Ehrenberg Cohn and Nageli can compare with the gigantic strides made by Pasteur who as Virchow once passionately declared4 was the first to handle the bacterial theory of infection in the grand style im grossen Styl and thence to attempt a work ing theory of immunity and a practicable en largement of Jenners scheme of preventive inoculation It is this that gives Pasteur his fixed and unassailable position as the true founder of bacteriologyat least so far as the history of medical science is concerned In reference to Dr Henry Skinners note on the mosquito theory of yellow fever6 I have been reminded by Professor Osler that there are authorities recently cited by Boyce6 that quite put Finley in the shade Of these the claims of Dr J C Nott 1848 have not been disputed while a paper by Louis DanielBeauperthuy published in the Ga ceta Oficial de Cumana 1853 is probably the best early contribution extant on the mos quito theory containing a remarkably clear perception of the haemolysis produced by tox ins and venoms and a clever note on the characteristic striped legs of the yellow fever mosquito Stegomyia calopus

MEDICAL MUSEUM A COMMENT ON ASPHYXIA SOME surprising material is contained in Dr John Auers reply to a note on the Ef fect of Asphyxia on the Pupil by A H Ryan F V Guthrie and myself2 As he does not present any evidence against nor even deny the accuracy of our observations on the phenomenon to which we recalled attention by the statement that as a rule a very marked constriction of the pupils occurs in an early stage of asphyxia no reply is necessary But since he attempts to account for our statement by saying that had we pushed our experiments further we would have found the marked dilatation of the pupil which oc curs in mammals during the second and third stages of asphyxia as the senior author of the note I feel it incumbent upon me to make cer tain statements in order that those not thor 1SCIENCE N S 1910 XXXI 578 2 SCIENCE N S 1910 XXXI 395396 oughly conversant with the subject may not receive erroneous impressions regarding the phenomena of asphyxia on the pupil It would seem that the classical phenomena of asphyxia are too well known to require mention but in view of the above I will here give an elementary statement of them taken from Starling to whom we referred in our communication The phenomena of asphyxia may be divided into three stages 1 In the first stage that of hyperpnoea the respiratory movements are increased in amplitude and in rhythm This increase affects at first both inspiratory and expiratory muscles Gradually the force of the expiratory movements become increased out of all proportion to the inspiratory and the first stage merges into 2 The second which consists of expiratory con vulsions in which almost every muscle of the body may be involved Just at the end of the first stage consciousness is lost and almost imme diately after the loss of consciousness we may observe a number of phenomena extending to almost all the functions of the body some of which have been already studied Thus at this time the vasomotor center is excited causing universal vascular constriction There is often also secretion of saliva inhibition or increase of intestinal movements constriction of the pupil4 and so on 3 At the end of the second minute after the stoppage of the aeration of the blood the expira tory convulsions cease almost suddenly and give way to slow deep inspirations With each inspira tory spasm the animal stretches itself out and opens its mouth widely as if gasping for breath The whole stage is one of exhaustion the pupils dilate widely4 and all reflexes are abolished The pauses between the inspirations become longer and longer until at the end of four or five minutes the animal takes its last breath Therefore the implication that we were not aware that dilatation of the pupil occurs in a later stage of asphyxia is unworthy of further mention Nor need any attention be paid to the term original communication applied to our note for by this fact alone he shows that he had not read it even with SElements of

extension of these copyrights by new editions continuations and supplements such as may be needed in the study of botany and as may best enhance and prolong the pecuniary value of the bequest LETTERS

this journal Feb 3 we gave the name of  La Grange to this meteorite overlooking the fact that this name was already applied to the Oldham County Kentucky iron In order to avoid confusion we would suggest that this name be dropped and that instead this meteorite be designated by the name of the county in which it was found Fayette County Tex and under this title will shortly appear Amezriaan J7ozrna of Scz subsequent to the veins and doubtless at the time of the fall A dark clouding for the most part surrounds these fissures the darkest parts being farthest from the fissure and terminated in some cases by a dark line similar to the veins As all of the fis sures are not surrounded by this dark shading and as some of the clouded spots contain no fissures it argues that the coloration can not be the effect of decomposition induced by the cracks particu larly as there is no apparent effect of decomposition extending in from the surface of the stone The clouding is perhaps older than the cracks and formed lines of weakness which the cracks followed Further sections may throw more light on this point The general structural appearance of the polished section is that of a fine compact conglomerate of greenishgray color When held so as to reflect the light properly the grains of iron might as to number and distribution be likened to the stars in the Milky Way Only a few grains attain the size of an eighth of an inch although two or three grains composed of iron and troilite are a full quarterinch in diameter Nearly all of the larger grains con tain troilite so that our efforts to develop the Widmanstadtian figures were only partially successful In making a mould of the stone before cutting it the surface was thoroughly oiled which removed a good deal of the ironrust showing much more of the original black crust remaining than could be seen at first WARD  HOWELL Rochester NY May 24 ence for June papers by Mr J E Whitfield of the United States Geo logical Survey and Mr G P Merrill of the United States National Museum the former having worked it up very thoroughly from the chemical side and the latter microscopically They find it to consist essentially of enstatite and olivine with a good deal of nickel iron and some pyrrhotite The iron con tains over fifteen per cent of nickel and about two and a half per cent of cobalt Since the preparation of these papers we have cut three slices an inch and a quarter thick from the centre of the stone which enables us to add some interesting facts The black veins that were observed at several points on the surface are found to extend entirely through the mass and to be arranged mainly in two sets in each of which the veins are approximately parallel the two sets crossing each other at an angle of about 45 This systematic arrangement of the veins which may be only accidental is shown in the accompanying cut which represents a face of one of the slices As the planes of the veins are cut nearly at right angles by the sections they show on each of them in approximately the same positions This is particularly the case with the narrow vein shown at the base of the section Although only a mere line it is uniform throughout and is seen in exactly the same position on all of the sections therefore we have already revealed the plane of this vein 15 by 4 inches with no indications of petering out The irregular thick vein also maintains a nearly uniform appear ance throughout the four inches of thickness The sections also reveal a number of fissures or cracks formed An Unusual Auroral Bow FOR several years past the northern lights at Buffalo have been a rare meteor Last evening an unusually interesting display was witnessed As twilight faded a luminous bank appeared in the north which increased in brightness and altitude until nearly midnight This was accompanied by the usual phenomena of a bright aurora ie a yellowishgreen color long streamers ema nating from a bright irregular arch resting on dark clouds and the eastward billowy motion of the streamers of light The most interesting part however was an arch which rested its extremities on the eastern and western horizons and passed at first a few de grees south of the zenith but which drifted several degrees farther south before final disappearance This arch formed about 9 oclock remained sharply defined until 945 and at ioI5 was still faintly visible Its width appeared to be about that of the rainbow and it was at first as symmetrical Subsequently it became some what bent and of irregular width The bends convex southward slowly passed along the bow westward As it faded out the ex tremities were displaced by streamers of light Those in the east were very distinct and four or more at a time appeared in this col onnade A phenomenon not before witnessed by me was a steady and rapid drifting or flowing of the luminous cloudlike matter of the arch from the east towards the west This could be plainly seen by the unaided eye for about forty degrees of the upper part of the band and any particular cloud would traverse this space in two minutes D S KELLICOTT Buffalo NY May 2I 266 VOL XI No 278

J100358,THE SCHOOL REVIEW,1075652,A FEW MATHEMATICAL TEXTBOOKS,I244537,BOOK REVIEWS A FEW MATHEMATICAL TEXTBOOKS IT IS PERHAPS NOT EXPECTED THAT A REVIEW FOR AMERICAN TEACHERS SHOULD DWELL AT ANY LENGTH UPON FOREIGN WORKS IF SO IT IS UNFORTUNATE SINCE IT IS TO THE CONTINENT OF EUROPE THAT WE MUST STILL LOOK FOR THE MOST INSPIRING AT LEAST FOR MOST OF THE INSPIRING TEXTBOOKS ON MATHEMATICS ONE OF THESE IS DR BIGERS WORK ON PROJECTIVE GEOMETRY THE LATEST ADDITION TO THE SAMMLUNG SCHUBERT WHILE THE SUBJECT HAS AS YET NO PLACE IN THE AMERICAN SECONDARY SCHOOL AND NOT MUCH OF A STANDING IN THE COLLEGE IT IS BECOMING SO PROMINENT THAT HIGHSCHOOL TEACHERS CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE IGNORANT OF ITS SCOPE AND VALUE IN ENGLISH WE HAVE LONG BEEN LIMITED TO THE TRANSLATION OF CREMONA AT LEAST UNTIL THE RECENT APPEARANCE OF A TRANSLATION OF REYES WELLKNOWN WORK A GOOD TEXTBOOK ON THE SUBJECT HAS HOWEVER BEEN MUCH NEEDED AND THIS WANT HAS BEEN ADMIRABLY SUPPLIED FOR GERMAN READERS BY DR BOGER HE HAS IT IS NEEDLESS TO SAY FOLLOWED REYES PRESENTATION OF VON STAUDTS THEORY BUT HAS FELT FREE TO DEPART FROM IT WHERE THERE IS A DEFINITE GAIN BY DOING SO AS IN THE ADOP TION OF THOMASS DEFINITION OF PROJECTIVE RELATIONS AND IN HIS TREATMENT OF IMAGINARY ELEMENTS THE DISTINGUISHING EXCELLENCE OF THE BOOK IS ITS LUCID STYLE COMBINED WITH ITS CONCISENESS REYE AND CREMONA ARE OFTEN PROLIX AS PERHAPS BECOMES THE WRITERS OF TREATISES BUT BOGER PROJECTS THE DISTINCTIVE POINTS OF THE THEORY UY ON THE STUDENTS PLANE EVEN AS HE SIMILARLY TREATS THE GEOMETRIC POINTS IN SPACE THE PRINCIPLE OF DUALITY PLAYS ITS IMPORTANT PART FROM THE FIRST BUT THE ANHARMONIC RATIO IS NOT INTRO DUCED UNTIL THE READER IS PREPARED FOR IT THROUGH A CONSIDERABLE STUDY OF HARMONIC ELEMENTS FOR ONE WHO CARES FOR A SCHOLARLY BUT SUCCINCT PRESENTATION OF THE SUBJECT THIS BOOK WILL BE FOUND VALUABLE DR MILNES LATEST ARITHMETIC 2 IS WRITTEN IN THE STYLE AND WITH THE PURPOSE THAT CHARACTERIZES HIS OTHER WORKS THE STYLE IS POPULAR AND THE PURPOSE IS TO FURNISH AN EASY BOOK THAT DOES NOT DEPART ANY MORE THAN NECESSARY FROM THE TRADITIONAL HE GIVES THE INCORRECT DEFINITIONS OF NUMBER ARABIC NOTATION MULTIPLICATION AND SIMILAR TERMS THAT HAVE BECOME SO FAMILIAR THAT MOST TEACHERS HAVE CEASED TO THINK ABOUT THEM IF WE MAY JUDGE BY THE NUMBER OF PROBLEMS UNDER THE VARIOUS TOPICS TROY WEIGHT IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN AVOIRDUPOIS AND APOTHECARIES THAN TROY ALL OF WHICH IS QUITE DISCOURAGING TO THOSE WHO ARE ENDEAVORING TO ELIMINATE FROM ARITHMETIC THE USELESS ACCUMULATIONS OF THE CENTURIES THE EXERCISES ARE HOWEVER WELL GRADED AND NOT WITHOUT INTEREST AND HEREIN LIES THE CHIEF VALUE OF THE BOOK MRS HORNBROOKS RECENT WORK3 IS MUCH LESS TRADITIONAL IT IS TRUE HOWEVER THAT I R BOGER EBENE

ARITHMETIC AMERICAN BOOK CO 900O PP 416 PRICE 65 CENTS 481THE SCHOOL REVIEW SHE GIVES THE SAME INCORRECT DEFINITION OF  ARABIC  NOTATION AND THAT THE UNEXPLAINED RULE TOO OFTEN FINDS PLACE AS IN THE TREATMENT OF THE LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE PERCENT AGE THE DIVISIBILITY OF NUMBERS AND PROPORTION INTENDED FOR THE GRAMMAR GRADES IT VERY PROPERLY INTRODUCES THE RUDIMENTS OF ALGEBRA AND OF METRICAL GEOMETRY AND DOES SO IN A SKILLFUL MANNER IT DOES NOT SEEM HOWEVER THAT THE VALUE OF THE SIMPLE EQUATION IS SUFFICIENTLY APPRECIATED IN THE TREATMENT OF PROPORTION THE BOOK SEP ARATES THE SUBJECTS OF RATIO AND PROPORTION BY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES AN INTERESTING INNOVATION THE FORMER TOPIC PRECEDES THE TREATMENT OF FRACTIONS WHICH SUGGESTS A VALUABLE THOUGH OFTEN OVERWORKED EDUCATIONAL IDEA THIS IDEA HOWEVER SEEMS TO BEAR NO FRUIT IN THE DISCUSSION THE BOOK CONTAINS MUCH THAT WILL APPEAL TO GOOD TEACHERS AS OF VALUE ESPECIALLY IN THE QUESTIONS AT THE BEGINNINGS OF THE VARIOUS CHAPTERS THE WEAK FEATURES OF THE WORK ARE THE UNNECESSARY USE OF ARBITRARY RULES AND PRINCIPLES AND THE MONOTONOUS ARRANGEMENT OF THE DISCOURAGINGLY LONG LISTS OF PROBLEMS SOMEWHAT MORE PRETENTIOUS IN TITLE BUT LESS VALUABLE IN FACT IS HALLS LITTLE WORK ON COMMERCIAL ARITHMETIC THE BOOK IS WRITTEN WITH THE HONEST DESIRE TO PRESENT THE MOST NECESSARY PARTS OF COMMERCIAL ARITHMETIC AS IT IS FOUND IN AMERICA TODAY FOR THIS IT IS TO BE COMMENDED THE INTRODUCTIONS TO THE CHAPTERS ON STOCKS AND BONDS BANKING AND EXCHANGE ARE VALUABLE BUT MUCH OF THE REST OF THE BOOK IS OPEN TO SUCH SERIOUS CRITICISM AS TO MAKE IT CERTAIN THAT IT WILL NOT BE FAVORABLY RECEIVED THE LOWER STRATUM OF TEACHERS WILL NOT USE IT BECAUSE IT ATTEMPTS TO BE MODERN AND THE UPPER STRATUM WILL NOT BECAUSE OF ITS FAULTS IT IS CARELESS IN ITS STATEMENTS AS IN ITS CONFUSION OF RATE AND RATE PER CENT IN SAYING THAT THE RATE HAS TO BE CHANGED TO A DECIMAL BEFORE THE PROBLEM CAN BE SOLVED IN ASSERTING THAT A DECIMAL FRACTION HAS TO BE TRANSFORMED TO BECOME A RATE AND IN SAYING THAT 5 PER CENT INTEREST MEANS 005 ON EVERY DOLLAR WHEN IT MEANS 005 OF ANY NUMBER OF DOLLARS THE PRODUCT OF TWO ABSTRACT NUMBERS OFTEN APPEARS IN STEP FORM AS A CONCRETE NUMBER AND THERE IS A GENERAL CARELESSNESS IN THE MATTER OF SYMBOLISM OF THIS KIND RULES ABOUND OFTEN AS FORMULAS AND USUALLY WITH SO LITTLE EXPLANATION AS TO MAKE THEIR PRESENCE A SOURCE OF DANGER THE BOOK IS DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS THE FIRST CONTAINING SUBJECTS NOT INVOLVING TIME IN WHICH BONDS ARE INCLUDED AND THE SECOND THOSE INVOLVING TIME IN WHICH CHECKS AND SIGHT DRAFTS ARE EXPLAINED FEATURES THAT MAKE ONE DOUBT THE VALUE OF THE DIVISION AVERAGING OF ACCOUNTS TAKES MORE SPACE THAN PARTIAL PAYMENTS A FACT THAT MAY BE JUSTIFIED ON THE SCORE OF DIFFICULTY BUT CERTAINLY NOT FROM THE IMPORTANCE OF THE SUBJECT WITH WHAT PLEASURE DOES ONE EMERGE FROM THE HUMDRUM OF THE COMMONPLACE ON GETTING HOLD OF A BOOK LIKE CANTORS RECENT ARITHMETIC OF DAILY LIFE2 IT IS WITH INTER EST THAT WE TURN THE LEAVES OF A BOOK ON ARITHMETIC BY A PROFESSOR IN A GERMAN UNIVER SITY A MAN WHOSE FAME IS WORLDWIDE IN THE LINE OF THE HISTORY OF MATHEMATICS AND ONE WHOSE NAME HAS ALWAYS BEEN CONNECTED OUTSIDE OF HEIDELBERG WITH THE MORE ADVANCED BRANCHES OF THE SCIENCE FOR MANY YEARS HOWEVER PROFESSOR CANTOR HAS GIVEN DURING THE WINTER SEMESTER A COURSE OF LECTURES UPON POLITICAL ARITHMETIC FOR THOSE INTERESTED IN FINANCIAL QUESTIONS THE ESSENCE OF THESE LECTURES IS SET FORTH IN A 1 GEORGE HALL THE COMMTON SENSE OF COZMMERCIAL ARITHMETIC THE MACMILLAN COMPANY

ONES POCKET BUT SO SCHOLARLY AS TO BECOME AT ONCE A STANDARD WITHIN LESS THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY PAGES MAY BE FOUND HISTORICAL AND HIGHLY SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSIONS OF SIMPLE AND COMPOUND INTEREST PROBABILITIES AND THEIR APPLICATIONS IN STATE LOTTERIES NOT UNCOMMON ABROAD AND IN THE VARIOUS FORMS OF INSURANCE THE COMPUTATION OF DIVIDENDS AND OTHER MATTERS OF FINANCE AS FOUND IN THE REALBUSINESS LIFE OF THIS GENERATION IT WOULD DO MUCH GOOD TO THOSE WHO STILL CRY OUT FOR THE DISCIPLINARY VALUE OF ALLEGATION EQUATION OF PAYMENTS AND COMPOUND PROPOR TION TO READ A BOOK OF THIS KIND AND SEE THE GENUINE DISCIPLINE OF GENUINE BUSINESS IT WOULD HASTEN THE TIME WHEN THE PROBLEMS OF ARITHMETIC WOULD BELONG TO THE CURRENT GEN ERATION AND THIS WOULD BE A NOVELTY IN EDUCATION PROFESSOR DOWNEYS HIGHER ALGEBRA IS DISAPPOINTING A HIGHER ALGEBRA TODAY OUGHT TO MEAN MORE THAN ROBINSONS UNIVERSITY ALGEBRA OF A GENERATION AGO OR DAYS BOOK OF STILL AN EARLIER GENERATION BUT WHILE WE FIND HERE ONE OF THE BEST PIECES OF BOOK MAKING THAT ITS PUBLISHERS HAVE RECENTLY PRODUCED THE MATTER IS NO PARTICULAR IMPROVEMENT UPON THAT OF THE BOOKS MENTIONED WHY SHOULD A HIGHER ALGEBRA OF TODAY SET FORTH A RULE FOR EVERY OPERATION  IS MODERN PEDAGOGY SO WRONG AS TO JUSTIFY THIS REACTION  SURELY THE WORLDS GREAT WRITERS OF TODAY TAKE THE OTHER VIEW AT LEAST IT MUST BE ADMITTED THAT A RULE REQUIRING TWENTYTHREE LINES FOR ITS STATEMENT CAN HARDLY BE CALLED A CONVENIENT RULE FOR THIS OPERATION HORNERS SYNTHETIC DIVISION THE AUTHOR TOO LAYS HIMSELF OPEN TO SERIOUS CRITICISM IN HIS DEFINITIONS HIS ALGEBRAIC SUM SEEMS TO EXCLUDE THE CASE OF ZERO HIS ALGEBRAIC DIFFERENCE WILL HARDLY APPEAL TO A STUDENT AS LUCID THE DEFINITION OF MULTIPLICATION EXCLUDES OPERATIONS WITH IRRATIONAL NUMBERS THAT OF DEGREE MAKES AH BY OF THE FIRST DEGREE THAT OF DIVISION ALLOWS OF A ZERO DIVISOR AND THAT OF FACTOR LX I AS A FACTOR OF XI IT MUST BE ADMITTED TOO THAT THE DEMONSTRATIONS ARE VERY UNSATISFACTORY THEY MIGHT PASS FOR A BEGINNERS BOOK BUT NOT FOR A HIGHER ALGEBRA THE DEMONSTRA TION OF THE RULE  FOR SUBTRACTION IS GENERALLY DISCARDED TODAY AS BEGGING THE QUES TION WHILE THAT CONCERNING THE LAW OF EXPONENTS IN DIVISION IS EVEN MORE OPEN TO CRITICISM IF THESE WERE ISOLATED CASES THE BOOK MIGHT BE COMMENDED BUT THEY ARE NOT AND THEIR FREQUENCY JUSTIFIES THE REMARK THAT THE BOOK IS DISAPPOINTING A SATISFACTORY PRESENTATION OF THE FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF NONEUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY IN SUCCINCT FORM HAS LONG BEEN DESIRED BY ENGLISH READERS THERE HAVE BEEN ANY NUMBER OF FUGITIVE ARTICLES AND BROCHURES BUT A CONVENIENT HANDBOOK TO THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN WANTING AND THIS WANT PROFESSOR MANNING OF BROWN UNIVERSITY HAS UNDERTAKEN TO FILL2 ON THE WHOLE THIS HAS BEEN SATISFACTORILY DONE THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT AN EXHAUSTIVE TREATISE HAS BEEN ATTEMPTED OR THAT ANY ORIGINALITY HAS BEEN SHOWN SAVE IN THE ARRANGEMENT OF MATTER BUT A READABLE PRIMER OF THE SUBJECT HAS BEEN PREPARED SETTING FORTH AS MUCH OF THE THEORY AS MOST TEACHERS WILL CARE FOR THE ARRANGEMENT IS A CONVENIENT ONE RECOGNIZING THAT THE DENIAL OF EUCLIDS POSTULATE OF PARALLELS AS A PRIORI TRUE LEADS TO THREE POSSIBLE GEOMETRIES THE AUTHOR SEEKS FIRST TO PROVE THE FUNDAMENTAL PROPOSITIONS COMMON TO ALL THREE HE THEN PRO CEEDS TO CONSIDER THE TWO NONEUCLIDEAN GEOMETRIES THE HYPERBOLIC AND THE ELLIPTIC IN BOTH TWO AND THREE DIMENSIONAL SPACES THE WORK CONCLUDES WITH A BRIEF HISTORI CAL NOTE XJOHN F DOWNEY HIGHER ALGEBRA AMERICAN BOOK CO I900 PP 416 PRICE I50 2 HENRY PARKER MANNING NONEUCLIDEAN GEOMETRY GINN  CO I90I PP 95 483THE SCHOOL REVIEW OUR INDEBTEDNESS TO DR MANNING MAY MAKE IT SEEM UNGENEROUS TO CALL ATTENTION TO MATTERS THAT WILL STRIKE THE READER UNFAVORABLY TEACHERS ARE APT HOWEVER TO LOOK UPON BOOKS OF THIS KIND AS MODELS AND HENCE A WORD OF CAUTION IS NECESSARY IT IS UNFORTUNATE THAT THE AUTHOR FAILS TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LINE AND LINE SEGMENT A DIS TINCTION THAT WOULD SIMPLIFY THE PHRASEOLOGY IN SEVERAL PLACES THAT ANGLES ARE MEASURED BY ARCS  MAY BE ALLOWED FOR BREVITY IN ELEMENTARY TEXTBOOKS BUT IT HARDLY HAS PLACE IN A WORK LIKE THIS SO THE STATEMENT THAT FROM ANY POINT WITHOUT A LINE A PERPENDICULAR TO THE LINE CAN BE DRAWN FOLLOWED BY A PROOF THAT SUCH A LINE MERELY EXISTS SHAKES ONES CONFIDENCE EXACTLY AS WOULD A THEOREM STATING THAT A REGULAR HEP TAGON CAN BE INSCRIBED IN A CIRCLE IT BEING UNDERSTOOD THAT THE USUAL LIMITATIONS OF PLANE GEOMETRY ARE IMPOSED THERE IS A SIMILAR STATEMENT REGARDING THE DRAWING OF ONLY ONE SUCH PERPENDICULAR IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE AUTHOR MEANS BY  THE ANGLES AT THE EXTREMITIES OF TWO EQUAL PERPENDICULARS IF HE DID NOT GIVE A FIGURE AND THE LACK OF A DEFINITE ORDER OF LETTERS IN READING ANGLES SOMETIMES STRIKES THE READER AS UNFORTUNATE EVEN WHERE THE FIGURES ARE GIVEN THE RATHER ANTI QUATED FORMS HYPOTHENUSE AND DIEDRAL ARE OF COURSE ALLOWABLE BUT THE REASON FOR THE UNUSUAL FACTORIAL SYMBOL P 59 IS NOT SO APPARENT THE HISTORICAL NOTE IS POSSIBLY EXTENDED ENOUGH FOR THE PURPOSE THE AUTHOR HAS NOT CONSULTED THE STANDARD WORKS UPON THE SUBJECT HOWEVER AND HIS BIBLIOGRAPHY DOES NOT PRETEND TO BE

BY EDWARD BRADFORD TITCHENER NEW YORK THE MACMILLAN COMPANY 190O TEACHERS WILL BE INTERESTED AND PLEASED TO FIND THAT PROFESSOR TITCHENER HAS SET HIMSELF DEFINITELY TO PROVIDE A TEXTBOOK THAT SHALL BE TEACHABLE HE HAS IN FACT TAKEN INFINITE PAINS TO AID INSTRUCTORS IN THE DIRECTION OF A COURSE IN PSYCHOLOGY AND TO SECURE IN STUDENTS WHAT HE REGARDS AS THE RIGHT ATTITUDE TOWARD THE COURSE IN ALL ITS DETAILS THE INSTRUCTORS MANUAL OF ABOUT 450 PAGES IS FILLED WITH REFERENCES TO PSYCHOLOGICAL LITERATURE DESCRIPTIONS OF APPARATUS DETAILS CONCERNING THE EXPERIMENTS IN FACT WITH SUCH AN OUTFIT OF KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING THE COURSE REACHING EVEN TO SIX TEEN SETS OF EXAMINATION QUESTIONS AS A PAINSTAKING INSTRUCTOR MIGHT GATHER FOR HIM SELF IN FIVE OR TEN YEARS EXPERIENCE THE DIRECTIONS IN THE STUDENTS MANUAL ARE DETAILED CLEAR AND PRECISE ANY INSTRUCTOR WHO MAKES IT THE AIM OF A LABORATORY COURSE TO GIVE STUDENTS KNOWLEDGE OF THE FACTS ABOUT OUR FEELINGS OF MATERIAL OBJECTS AND THEIR RELATION TO PHYSICAL PROCESSES AND TO TRAIN THEM IN INTROSPECTION AND IN THE ANALYSIS OF SUCH FEELINGS INTO MENTAL ELEMENTS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY FIND A USE FOR PRO FESSOR TITCHENERS MANUAL IN WHOLE OR IN PART BUT TO SAY THAT HE HAS DONE EXCEEDINGLY WELL THE THING HE SET OUT TO DO IS NOT TO AGREE THAT IT IS THE BEST THING TO DO SOME PERHAPS MANY WOULD PROPOSE A QUITE DIFFERENT AIM AND TREATMENT FOR AN ELEMENTARY LABORATORY COURSE IN PSYCHOLOGY A MAJORITY OF STUDENTS OF PSYCHOLOGY ARE IN PROFESSIONAL SCHOOLS FOR TEACHERS IS THIS SORT OF A COURSE THE BEST FOR THEM  THE SAME QUESTION MAY BE APPLIED TO STUDENTS OF 484

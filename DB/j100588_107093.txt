J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107093,DESCRIPTION OF THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON FROM THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL,I206956,X DESCRIPTION OF THE ARSENIIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON FRONT THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL BY THE COUNT DE BOURNON COMA MUNICATED BY THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART KE B P R S READ FEBRUARY 9 8OCI SECTION L ARSENIATES OF COPPER THE NATURAL COMBINATION OF THE ARSENIC ACID WITH COPPER AND THE DIFFERENT ASPECTS UNDER WHICH THIS COMBINATION APPEARS ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE UNITED WERE AMONG THOSE OBJECTS OF MINERALOGY RESPECTING WHICH OUR IMPERFECT KNOWLEDGE REQUIRED THE AID OF STUDY AND OBSERVATION A NEW COPPER MINE LATELY WORKED CALLED HUEL GORLAND IN THE PARISH OF GWENNAP IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL HAVING WITHIN THE LAST TWO YEARS ENRICHED THE CABINETS OF LONDON WITH SOME VERY FINE SPECIMENS OF THESE ARSENIATES I HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO THEM AND I OFFER THE RESULT OF MY OBSERVATIONS TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY AS AN ACKNOW LEDGMENT OF THAT GRATITUDE WHICH I AND ALL FRENCHMEN FAITHFUL TO THEIR KING OUGHT TO FEEL AND PROFESS TO A COUNTRY WHICH HAS DISTINGUISHED ITSELF AS THE PROTECTOR OF HONOUR AND LOYALTY ALTHOUGH THERE APPEARS ACCORDING TO SOME GERMAN AUTHORS REASON TO THINK THAT ARSENIATE OF COPPER HAS BEEN FOUND IN SILESIA ITS MUCH GREATER ABUNDANCE AS WELL AS THE VARIOUS MDCCCI Z170 COUNT DE BOURNONS DESCRIPTION OF ASPECTS UNDER WHICH IT EXISTS IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL MAY ENTITLE IT TO BE CONSIDERED AS ONE OF THE MANY MINERAL SUB STANCES WHICH ARE PECULIAR OR NEARLY SO TO ENGLAND OF THE VARIOUS WORKS ON MINERALOGY LATELY PUBLISHED THERE ARE FEW WHICH HAVE NOT MENTIONED ARSENIATE OF COPPER AMONG THE ORES OF THIS METAL IT SEEMS HOWEVER THAT SOME OF THEIR AUTHORS HAD NO KNOWLEDGE OF THIS ORE EXCEPT FROM THE VERY IMI PERFECT ACCOUNT COMMUNICATED BY THE CELEBRATED KLAPROTH IN 1787 IN THE SCBRIFTEN DER GESELLSCHFAT NATURFJRSCHENDER FREUNDE VOL VIIL IN WHICH HE HAS GIVEN AN INTERESTING SKETCH OF THE MI NERALOGY OF THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL AS FAR AS IT WAS THEN KNOWN OTHERS SEEM TO HAVE POSSESSED ONLY IMPERFECT SPECI MENS OF ARSENIATE OF COPPER AS NONE OF THE FORMS WHICH THEY ATTRIBUTE TO ITS CRYSTALS CAN BELONG TO IT BESIDES THEY ALL CONFOUND WITH THIS ORE THOSE CUBIC CRYSTALS OF A VERY BEAU FIFUL GREEN COLOUR WHICH ARE FOUND IN MUTTRELL MINE CONTIGUOUS TO HUEL GORLAND MINE AND WHICH ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS MADE WITH THE GREATEST CARE AND ABILITY BY MR CHENEVIX ARE OF A NATURE TOTALLY DIFFERENT AND CANNOT PROPERLY BE CLASSED AMONG COPPER ORES AS THEY CONTAIN BUT A VERY INCONSIDERABLE QUANTITY OF THAT METAL TFHE EXISTENCE OF ARSENIATE OF COPPER SEEMS HOWEVER EVEN AT THIS DAY TO BE AN OBJECT OF DOUBT AMONG THE FRENCH MINE RALOGISTS FOR THE ABB6 HAUY DOES NOT MENTION IT IN THE 28TH AND FOLLOWING NUMBERS OF THE JOURNAL DES MINES ALTHOUGH THEY CONTAIN AN INTERESTING EXTRACT OF A SYSTEM OF MINERALOGY WHICH HE WAS THEN PREPARING FOR THE PRESS NOR HAS M FOURCROY EVEN HINTED AT IT IN HIS SYSTEME DES CONNOISSANCES CIIMIQUES LATELY PUBLISHED IT IS NOW ABOVE TWENTY YEARS SINCE ARSENIATE OF COPPER WASTHE 4RSENZATES OF COPPER AND OF IROI 171 DISCOVERED IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL IT WAS FIRST FOUND EITHER IN CARRARACH MINE IN THE PARISH OF GWENNAP OR IN TINCROFT MINE IN THE PARISH OF ALLOGAN ITS MATRIX LIKE THAT OF ALMOST ALL THE COPPER ORES OF THIS COUNTRY WAS SILICEOUS AND CON SISTED OF A DECOMPOSED GRANITE OF WHICH THE GREATEST PART OF THE FELDSPAR HAD PASSED INTO THE STATE KNOWN BY THE NAME OF KAOLIN IT WAS ACCOMPANIED WITH GREY VITREOUS COPPER ORE FRE QUENTLY IN CONSIDERABLE MASSES  ALSO WITH MUCH BLACK OXIDE OF COPPER AND WITH VARIOUS OXIDES OF IRON THE ARSENIATE HERE SPOKEN OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEEN FOUND IN LARGE QUANTITY HAD CEASED TO EXIST IN THE ABOVEMENTIONED MINES WHEN HUEL GORLAND MINE LATELY WROUGHT BEGAN TO ENRICH MINERALOGY WITH THIS UNCOMMON SUBSTANCE THE MA TRIX OF THIS IS LIKEWISE SILICEOUS  SOMETIMES CRYSTALLINE AND SOMETIMES IN AN AMORPHOUS MASS HERE AND THERE WE FIND MIXED WITH IT IN GREATER OR LESS PROFUSION ALL THE KNOWN OXIDES OF COPPER MANY OF THE ARGILLACEOUS OXIDES OF IRON ALSO GREY VITREOUS COPPER ORE ARSENICAL PYRITES AND THE RICH DEEP COLOURED YELLOW COPPER ORE THIS LAST IS OFTEN FOUND DIFFERING FROM ITS USUAL APPEARANCE IN A MANNER WHICH I BELIEVE HAS NOT HITHERTO BEEN TAKEN NOTICE OF I THINK IT SHOULD MAKE A DISTINCT VARIETY AMONG THE DEEP YELLOW COPPER ORES UNDER THE NAME OF YELLOW HERNATITIC COPPER ORE WHEN THE COMBINATION OF COPPER WITH IRON AND SULPHUR IS RICH IN METAL FOR WHEN IT IS POOR IT IS ONLY A MARTIAL PYRITES MIXED WITH A LITTLE COPPER ITS APPROPRIATE COLOUR WHEN A PIECE IS FRESH BROKEN IS A DEEP YELLOW AND THIS YELLOW COLOUR IS MORE DEEP IN PROPORTION AS THE QUANTITY OF COPPER IS MORE ABUNDANT IN ITS RICHEST STATE IT ASSUMES A MORE OR LESS GREENISH TINT THE SURFACE OF A FRESH FRACTURE IS VERY BRILLIANT AND APPEARS RATHER Z2I7G TCOUNT DE BOURNONS DESCRPTION F UNEVEN AS IF COMPOSED OF SMALL LAMINX CROSSING ONE ANOTHER IN AN IRREGULAR MANNER WHEN IT BEGINS TO DECOMPOSE ITS SUR FACE IS COVERED WITH THE MOST BEAUTIFUL COLOURS AMONG WHICH THE MOST PREDOMINANT ARE VIOLET BLUE AND GREEN THIS HAS CAUSED IT TO BE COMPARED TO A PIGEONS BREAST WHEN THESE COLOURS ARE VERY DEEP AND OCCUPY THE WHOLE SURFACE OF A PIECE WE COMMONLY PERCEIVE HERE AND THERE SOME LITTLE POINTS IN THE STATE OF RED OXIDE OF IRON AND OTHERS OF A GREEN COLOUR IN THE STATE OF GREEN CARBONATE OF COPPER THIS KIND OF COPPER ORE IS SOMETIMES OF A DEEP YELLOW COLOUR WHICH INCLINES THE MORE TO GREEN AS IT IS DESTITUTE OF BRILLIANCY IT IS VERY COMPACT AND WHEN BROKEN THE FRACTURE APPEARS SMOOTH SOMETIMES A LITTLE CONCHOIDAL ITS SURFACE HOW EVER HAS A VERY FINE GRAIN WHICH WHEN VIEWED WITH A POWERFUL LENS RESEMBLES THE AGGREGATION OF A VERY CLOSE COMPACT MASS OF THE FINEST SAND ITS MOST USUAL TEXTURE IS THAT OF THIN LAYERS OR PLATES LYING ONE UPON ANOTHER AND BEING VERY CLOSELY UNITED SO AS TO BE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE BUT THEY ARE VERY READILY DISTINGUISHED WITH THE LENS THESE LAYERS HOWEVER DO NOT ADHERE VERY STRONGLY AS THEY MAY ALWAYS BE SEPARATED BY THE STROKE OF A HAMMER THIS ORE FREQUENTLY ASSUMES A MAMILLATED FORM THE MAP MILLAE BEING OF DIFFERENT DIMENSIONS FROM THE SIZE OF A MANS HEAD AND EVEN LARGER TO THAT OF A SMALL PEA IN THE LATTER CASE THE MAMILLA ARE VERY OFTEN UNITED AS IN THAT KIND OF IRON ORE WHICH IS CALLED CLUSTER BOTRYOID OR KIDNEY HEMATITES SOME TIMES THE SURFACE OF THE MAMILLE IS COVERED WITH SMALL POINTS BUT MORE FREQUENTLY IT IS SMOOTH SO AS VERY MUCH TO RESEMBLE A PIECE OF POLISHED METAL AND AS THE SURFACE OF THE MAMILLX INCLINES RATHER TO A BROWN COLOUR THEY HAVE THE APPEARANCE OFTHE ARSENZIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 173 ANTIQUE BRONZE THE GREEN OXIDE OF COPPER WHICH SOMETIMES IS OBSERVED ON IT COMPLETES THE ILLUSION BY ASSUMING THE ASPECT OF THAT FINE PATINA WHICH OFTEN COVERS PIECES OF ANTIQUE BRONZE THIS ORE IS LIKEWISE FOUND IN THE FORM OF SMALL CYLINDERS OFTEN PLACED ONE AGAINST THE OTHER AND SOMETIMES RAMIFIED IN THE SAME WAY AS IS OBSERVED IN SOME KINDS OF HEMATITES WHEN THE BROKEN SURFACE OF IT IS EXPOSED FOR SOME TIME TO THE AIR IT ASSUMES THE COLOUR OF TARNISHED GOLD IT ACQUIRES ALSO BY THE DECOMPOSITION OF ITS SURFACE THE SAME VIOLET BLUE AND GREEN COLOURS AS THE KIND ALREADY DESCRIBED BUT ALTHOUGH THESE COLOURSARE FREQUENTLY VERY DEEP THEY NEVER ARE SO BRILLIANT AS IN THAT KIND IT IS VERY UNCOMMON TO FIND PIECES OF THIS ORE THAT ARE NOT MIXED ATD FREQUENTLY EVEN PENETRATED WITH GREY VITREOUS COP PER ORE THAT WHICH ACCOMPANIES THE ARSENIATE OF HUEL GORLAND MINE OFFERS IN THIS RESPECT AN UNCOMMON AND VERY PARTICULAR APPEARANCE THE YELLOW ORE IS MECHANICALLY MIXED WITH THE VITREOUS ORE SO AS TO FORM A COMPOUND IN WHICH BY THE AS SISTANCE OF A LENS THE SMALL PARTICLES BELONGING TO EACH OF THOSE TWO ORES MAY BE VERY CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED THE SPECIFIC GRA VITY AS WELL AS THE QUANTITY OF COPPER IN THIS ORE VARIES CON SIDERABLY ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTIONS IN WHICH THE YELLOW COPPER ORE AND GREY VITREOUS COPPER ORE ARE MIXED TOGETHER SOMETIMES THEY SEEM TO BE MIXED IN EQUAL PROPORTIONS OR NEARLY SO NATURE HAS ESTABLISHED VERY REMARKABLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND THESE TAKE PLACE NOT ONLY IN THEIR FORMS BUT LIKEWISE IN THEIR HARDNESS AND SPECIFIC GRAVITY THESE DIFFERENCES ARISE EITHER FROM THE MANNER IN WHICH THE ARSENIC ACID IS COMBINED WITH THE COPPER OR FROM THE DIFFERENT PROPORTIONS174 COUNT DE BOURNONWS DESCRIPTION OF IN WHICH THESE TWO SUBSTANCES ARE COMBINED I HAVE BEEN NA TURALLY LED TO FOLLOW THE SAME ORDER AND TO DIVIDE THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER INTO FOUR DIFFERENT SPECIES AND THE VERY INTERESTING ATNALYSIS OF THIS SUBSTANCE MADE BY MR CHENEVIX HAS AFFORDED ME THE MOST SATISFACTORY SANCTION TO THIS DIVISION IT IS THUS THAT THE CHEMIST AND THE NATURALIST BY FREELY UNITING THEIR LABOURS WITHOUT JEALOUSY OR PREUDICE OUGHT IN ALL CASES TO PROCEED IN ORDER TO ATTAIN THAT CERTAINTY WHICH IS THE DESIRABLE RECOMPENSE OF THEIR ENDEAVOURS FIRST SPECIES IRSENIATE OF COPPER IN THE FORM OF AN OBT SE OCTAEDRON THE MOST SIMPLE FORM UNDER WHICH THIS SPECIES APPEARS IS A VERY OBTUSE OCTAEDRON FORMED BY THE UNITED BASES OF TWO TETRAC DRAL PYRAMIDS WITH ISOSCELES TRIANGULAR PLANES  AND THIS AP PEARS TO BE ITS ORIGINAL FORM THIS OCTAEDRON HAS IN EACH OF ITS PYRAMIDS TWO OPPOSITE PLANES MORE INCLINED THAN THE OTHER TWO WHICH GIVES A PARALLELOGRAMMIC FORM TO THEIR COMMON BASE FIG I PLATE XIIT THE TWO PLANES MORE INCLINED THAN THE OTHERS MEET AT THE APEX OF EACH OF THE PYRAMIDS IN AN ANGLE OF 130E AND AT THE COMMON BASE IN ONE OF SOT THE TWO PLANES WHICH ARE LESS INCLINED MEET AT THE APEX IN AN ANGLE OF I I AND AT THE BASE IN ONE OF 65I THESE PLANES ARE COMMONLY SMOOTH AND BRIGHT SOMETIMES HOWEVER THEY ARE STRIATED IN A DIRECTION PARALLEL TO THEIR EDGES THE FOUR PLANES SELDOM TERMINATE IN ONE AND THE SAME POINT MORE COMMONLY THE APEX IS FORMED INTO A RIDGE THE OCTAEDRON BEING LENGTHENED PARALLEL TO ITS LESS INCLINED PLANES THE BASE IS THEN A SQUARE OR AT LEAST APPROACHES VERY NEARLY TO THAT FORM FIGT 2THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 175 THESE TWO VARIETIES ARE THE ONLY ONES I HAVE OBSERVED IN THE FORM OF THE CRYSTALS OF THIS SPECIES ALTHOUGH I HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY OF EXAMINING A GREAT NUMBER OF SPECIMENS THIS ARSENIATE IS VERY LIGHT ITS AVERAGE SPECIFIC GRAVITY TAKEN ON SIX PIECES PERFECTLY PURE WAS 2881 ITS HARDNESS IS LIKEWISE VERY INCONSIDERABLE IT EASILY SCRATCHES CALCAREOUS SPAR BUT MAKES NO IMPRESSION ON FLUOR SPAR IT IS SELDOM PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT BUT HAS GENERALLY A CLOUDY ASPECT THE USUAL COLOUR OF THIS SPECIES FOR THIS CHARACTER IS AS ESSEN TIAL IN METALLIC SUBSTANCES AS IT IS IMMATERIAL IN STONES IS A BEAUTIFUL DEEP SKYBLUE SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY IT INCLINES MORE OR LESS TO PRUSSIAN BLUE IT IS FREQUENTLY OF A VERY FINE GRASSGREEN THE CRYSTALSL HAVE THEN A MUCH MORE BEAUTIFUL TRANSPARENCY I HAVE SEEN SOME WHICH WERE OF A FINE APPLE GREEN OTHERS WHITE HAVING A SLIGHT BLUE CAST IN ONE PIECE THE CRYSTALS OF WHICH WERE OF A GREEN COLOUR AND LESS TRANSPA RENT THAN THEY COMMONLY ARE I DISCOVERED ON BREAKING THEM THAT THE COLOUR OF THEIR CENTRAL PART FOR ABOUT HALF THEIR THICK NESS WAS BLUE FROM THE OBSERVATIONS MADE BY MR CHE NEVIX IN HIS ANALYSIS OF THESE ARSENIATES IT APPEARS THAT THE VARIATION IN THEIR COLOUR PRINCIPALLY DEPENDS ON THE QUAN TITY OF WXATER WHICH ENTERS AS A CONSTITUENT PART INTO THEIR FORMATION THIS SPECIES IS FOUND MIXED WITH ALL THE OTHER KINDS OF ARSE NICAL COPPER ORE BUT THAT WHICH MOST COMMONLY ACCOMPANIES IT IS THE PRISMATIC TRIEDRAL SPECIES I HAVE NEVER DISCOVERED IN THIS SPECIES ANY THING WHICH COULD INDUCE ME TO SUPPOSE IT SUSCEPTIBLE OF DECOMPOSITION OR EVEN OF CHANGE176 COUNT DE BOURNONS DESCRIPTION OF SECOND SPECIES ARSENIATE OF COPPER IN HEXAEDRAL LAMEINT WITH INCLINED SIDES THIS SPECIES IS COMMONLY FOUND IN VERY FINE HEXAEDRAL LAMI ME THE SIX NARROW SIDES OF THESE LAMINOE HAVE AN INCLINED POSI TION ALTERNATELY IN A CONTRARY DIRECTION ON THE TWO BROAD PLANES IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EACH OF THE PLANES IS ENCOMPASSED BY THREE SIDES WHICH ARE INCLINED UPON IT FIG 3 AS FAR AS THE SMALL SIZE AND MORE PARTICULARLY THE THINNESS OF KHESE CRYSTALS HAS ENABLED ME TO JUDGE TWO OF THESE THREE INCLINED SIDES FORMI AN ANGLE OF ABOUT I33 WITH THE BROAD PLANES ON WHICH THEY INCLINE AND THE THIRD ONE OF IF5 THE TWO BROAD PLANES ARE SMOOTH AND HAVE A VERY BRILLIANT LUSTRE THE SIX NARROW SIDES ARE RENDERED VERY DULL BY THE GREAT NUMBER OF STRIK WITH WHICH THEY ARE COVERED MOST OF WHICH ARE VERY PROMINENT AND ALL ARE PARALLEL TO THE EDGES OF THE BROAD PLANES IN CONSEQUENCE OF THIS THESE CRYSTALS MAY BE DIVIDED PARALLEL TO THE PLANES ALMOST AS EASILY AS CRYSTALS OF MICA THIS STRUCTURE PREVENTS THE CRYSTAL FROM BEING CONSIDERED AS A MODIFICATION OF THE OCTAEDRON THATWHICH WOULD BE PRODUCED BY AN INCREASE OF THE INCLINED SIDES WOULD ONLY BE A SECONDARY CRYSTAL AND NONE OF THE SPECIMENS I HAVE SEEN GIVE MEREASON TO SUPPOSE THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A VARIETY THE COLOUR OF THIS SPECIES IS A FINE DEEP EMERALD GREEN SOME TIMNES THOUGH RARELY IT IS FOUND OF A LIGHTER COLOUR THE LUSTRE OF ITS BROAD PLANES WHICH ARE THE ONLY PARTS OF THE CRYSTAL THAT FORCIBLY STRIKE THE EYE GIVE IT PRETTY MUCH THE APPEARANCE OF THOSE COLOURED METAL PLATES WHICH ARE KNOWN BY THE NAME OF FOIL THIS SPECIES IS STILL LESS HEAVY THAN THE PRECEDING ITS SPE CIFIC GRAVITY BEING ONLY 25438THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 177 IT IS ALSO LESS HARD IT EASILY SCRATCHES GYPSUM BUT NOT CALB CAREOUS SPAR WHEN ITS CRYSTALS ARE VERY THIN THEY ARE VERY TRANSPARENT BUT THEIR TRANSPARENCY IS DIMINISHED WHEN THEY HAVE ANY DEGREE OF THICKNESS WHEN EXPOSED TO FIRE THIS SPECIES DECREPITATES VERY STRONGLY THIS ARSENIATE THE MATRIX OF WHICH IS GENERALLY QUARTZOUS IS OCCASIONALLY FOUND MIXED WITH SOME OTHER ARSENIATES OF COP PER AND PARTICULARLY WITH THE ACUTE OCTAEDRON IN THE CAPILLARY OR FIBROUS STATE SPEC A VAR L AND 2 BUT THE ORE MOST COMMONLY FOUND WITH IT IS THE RED COPPER ORE WHICH IS FRE QUENTLY VERY ABUNDANT I HAVE NEVER OBSERVED IN THIS SPECIES ANY APPEARANCE OF DECOMPOSITION THIRD SPECIES ARSENIATE OF COPPER IN THE FRMR OF AI ACUTE OCTAEDRON THE MOST SIMPLE FORM IN WHICH THIS THIRD SPECIES IS FOUND IS LIKEWISE AN OCTAEDRON BUT THIS OCTAEDRON INSTEAD OF BEING OBTUSE LIKE THAT OF THE FIRST SPECIES IS SLIGHTLY ACUTE IT HAS LIKE THAT IN EACH OF ITS PYRAMIDS TWO OPPOSITE PLANES MORE INCLINED THAN THE OTHER TWO THE MORE INCLINED PLANES MEET AT THE APEX IN AN ANGLE OF 840 AND AT THE BASE IN ONE OF 96  THE OTHER TWO MEET AT THE APEX IN AN ANGLE OF 680 AND AT THE BASE IN ONE OF I12 FIG 4 IN THIS OCTAEDRON IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS THAT THE PLANES WHICH COMPOSE ITS PYRAMIDS TEND TO ONE AND THE SAME POINT IN ORDER TO FORM THE APEX BUT IT IS MUCH MORE COMMON TO FIND IT EXTENDED IN A LINE PARALLEL TO THE LESS INCLINED PLANES OF THE MDCCC1 A A178 COUNT DE BOURNON DESCRIPTION OF PYRAMID FIG 5 THE CRYTAL IS STILL MORE FREQUENTLY FOUND IN THE FORM OF A LONG TETRAEDRAL RHOMBOIDAL PRISMN OF 840 AND 960 TERMINATED BY A DIEDRAL APEX WITH ISOSCELES TRIANGULAR PLANES WHICH ARE PLACED ON THE ANGLES OF 84 AND MEET IN ALL ANGLE OF 1 120 FIG 6 MOST COMMONLY BOTH IN THE PERFECT AND THE LENGTHENED OCTAEDRON THE ANGLES OF 960 ARE REPLACED BY A PLANE WHICH IS EQUALLY INCLINED ON THE ADJACENT SIDES FIG 7 AND IS FRE QUENTLY VERY BROAD  FIG 8  THEN THE TETRAEDRAL PRISM OF 84 AND 960 IS CHANGED INTO A FLAT HEXAEDRAL PRISN HAVING TWO ANGLES OF 84F AND THE OTHER FOUR OF 13W8 IREVER SAW THE ANGLES OF 840 REPLACED THE AVERAGE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS ARSENIATE OF COPPER TAKEN ON FIVE PURE PIECES WAS 428O IT IS SUFFICIENTLY HARD TO SCRATCH FLUOR SPAR BUT IS NOT HARD ENOUGH TO SCRATCH GLASS ITS USUAL COLOUR IS A BROWN OR BOTTLE GREEN SO DARK THAT THE CRYSTALS APPEAR OF A BLACKISH COLOUR WHEN THEY ARE NOT OPPOSED TO THE LIGHT SOMETIMES BUT VERY SELDOM IN THE REGULAR CRYS TALS WHICH HAPPEN TO BE RATHER THICKER THIS COLOUR IS A CLEARER GREEN IN OTHER SPECIMENS THE CRYSTALS HAVE A YELLOWISH CAST AND THE SURFACE THEN OFTEN REFLECTS THE LIGHT OF A GOLDEN TINT THE TRANSPARENCY OF THIS SPECIES IS GENERALLY PRETTY GREAT IT IS NOT ALWAYS CRYSTALLIZED IN A DETERMINATE FORM BUT IS AR ABSOLUTE PROTEUS BOTH WITH RESPECT TO THE DIFFERENT FORMS IN WHICH IT APPEARS AND THE VARIOUS COLOURS IT EXHIBITS I HAVE OBSERVED THE FIVE FOLLOWING VARIETIES OF ITTHE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRONE 79 VARIETY I CAPILLARY OF A DETERMINATE FORM IN THIS VARIETY THE CRYSTALS ARE EXTREMELY SLENDER YET PRE SERVE THEIR FORM WHICH IS THAT OF A VERY LENGTHENED OCTAEDRON THE SMALL SLENDER CRYSTALS OFTEN FORM THEMSELVES INTO A CON FUSED GROUP SOMETIMES HOWEVER THEY FORM SMALL MAMILLW BY THE DIVERGENCE OF A NUMBER OF THEM FROM A COMMON CENTRE THEIR COLOUR IS EITHER A FINE GRASS GREEN OR A YELLOWISH GREEN OR A GOLDEN YELLOW  AND THEY HAVE GENERALLY A BEAUTIFUL TRANS PARENCY VARIETY 2 CAPILLATY OF AN INDETERMINATE FORM IN THIS VARIETY THE VERY THIN NEEDLELIKE CRYSTALS ARE NOT TER MINATED BY THE DIEDRAL APEX OF I I  REPRESENTING TWO PLANES OF THE OCTAEDRON BUT GRADUALLY BECOME SMALLER AND TERMI NATE IN A VERY SHARP PYRAMID THIS VARIETY HAS THE SAME COLOURS AS THE PRECEDING AND ITS VERY SLENDER CRYSTALS ARE GROUPED IN THE SAME MANNER AS IN THAT SUBSTANCES IN A CRYSTALLIZED STATE IN PASSING FROM A DETERMI NATE FORM TO AN INDETERMINATE OR FIBROUS ONE FREQUENTLY ASSUME AN INTERMEDIATE FORM IN WHICH THE CRYSTAL INSENSIBLY TERMINATES IN A VERY ACUTE PYRAMID VARIETY A IN CRYSTALS PERFECTLY REGULAR FOR A PART OF THEIR LENGTH AND FIBROUS AT THEIR EXTREMITY IN THIS VARIETY THE CRYSTALS ARE PERFECT DURING A PART OF THEIR LENGTH  BUT THEIR SUBSTANCE INSENSIBLY DIVIDES AS IT APPROACHES THE EXTREMITY WHICH VERY OFTEN IS IN FACT NOTHING BUT A CLUSTER OF EXTREMELY DELICATE FIBRES THE COLOUR OF WHICH ALWAYS APPEARS LIGHTER THAN THAT OF THE SOLID PART OF THE CRYSTAL AA 2ISO COUNT DE BOURNONS DESCRIPTION T F VARIETY A AMIANTHBFORM THIS VARIETY IS COMPOSED OF FIBRES AS DELICATE AS THOSE OF AMI ANTHUS OF THE FLEXIBILITY OF WHICH THEY FREQUENTLY POSSESS A CERTAIN DEGREE TRHESE FIBRES ARE EITHER PARALLEL OR DIVERGENT FROM ONE COMMON CENTRE IN WHICH CASE THEY NEARLY RESEMBLE A HAIR PENCIL THEIR COLOUR VARIES CONSIDERABLY I HAVE SEEN THEM OF DIFFERENT SHADES OF GREEN FROM A GRASS GREEN TO A DARK BROWN GREEN OF A GOLDEN BROWN OF A STRAW COLOUR OF A GOLDEN YELLOW OF A GREENISH BLUE COLOUR AND EVEN PERFECTLY WHITE HAVING FREQUENTLY THE LUSTRE OF SATIN THE FIBRES ARE SOMETIMES SO DELICATE SO SHORT AND SO CON FUSEDLY GROUPED TOGETHER THAT THE WHOLE APPEARS LIKE A DUSTY COTTONY MASS THE TRUE NATURE OF WHICH IS DISCOVERABLE ONLY BY THE LENS AT OTHER TIMES THIS VARIETY APPEARS IN SMALL THIN LA MINX RATHER FLEXIBLE SOMETIMES SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE TO THE NAKED EYE SOMETIMES TOLERABLY LARGE AND PERFECTLY LIKE AMI ANTHUS PAPYRACEUS I HAVE SEEN THE LAST MENTIONED FORM OF THIS VARIETY OF A LIGHT GREEN COLOUR AND ALSO OF A VERY DELICATE WHITE VARIETY  HEMATITIFORM THIS VARIETY IS IN LAYERS EITHER FLAT OR MAMILLATED AND IS OF A FIBROUS TEXTURE BUT IS RENDERED COMPACT BY THE CLOSE MANNER IN WHICH THE FIBRES ARE UNITED TO EACH OTHER IN THE SAME WAY AS IS OBSERVED IN MANY MARTIAL HEMATITES AND MORE PARTICULARLY IN THAT KIND OF TIN ORE WHICH IS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF WOOD TIN TO WHICH SOME PIECES OF THIS ARSENIATE OF COPPER HAVE A VERY GREAT RESEMBLANCE YET IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS AS IN MANY AGGREGATE PYRITES OF A GLOBULAR FORM THAT THE SURFACE OF THETHE AXRSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 181 SMALL MAMIILLX IS COVERED WITH LITTLE ROUGH POINTS THESE ARE THE DIEDRAL APICES WHICH TERMINATE THE LITTLE CRYSTALS SUPPOSED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THEIR FORMATION THIS HEMATITIC VARIETY IS FOUND WITH THE SAME DIVERSITY OF COLOURS AS THE PRECEDING OR AMIANTHIFORM VARIETY FOURTH SPECIES ARSENIATE OF COPPER IN THE FORM OF A TRIEDRAL PRISM THE PRIMITIVE FORM OF THIS SPECIES IS A TRIEDRAL PRISM THE BASES OF WHICH ARE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES FIG 9 PLATEXIV THIS PRISM IS OFTEN CONSIDERABLY LENGTHENED IN A DIRECTION PARALLEL TO ONE OF ITS BASES FIG IO THIS FORM IS ONE OF THE MOST RARE IN CRYSTALLOGRAPHY THE CRYSTALS HAVE ALL THEIR SIDES SMOOTH AND BRILLIANT YET THERE ARE OBSERVABLE IN SOME OF THEM WHEN EXA MINED WITH A MAGNIFYING GLASS TRANSVERSE STRIAX ON THE SIDES OF THE PRISM ALL OF WHICH ARE PARALLEL TO THE EDGES OF THE BASES IT IS THEREFORE CHIEFLY ON THE PLANES OF THE BASES THAT THE CRYSTALLINE LAMINAE APPEAR LAID UPON ONE ANOTHER TO PRODUCE EITHER THE INCREASE OR THE MODIFICATION OF THE PRIMITIVE CRYSTAL AS THE CRYSTALS OF THIS SPECIES ARE SELDOM SUFFICIENTLY DETACHED TO BE EASILY PERCEIVED AND INDEED ARE VERY FREQUENTLY SO SMALL AS TO ESCAPE THE OBSERVATION OF THE NAKED EYE I THINK IT NECES SARY TO DESCRIBE HERE ALL THE VARIOUS FORMS IN WHICH I HAVE SEEN THEM WITH THE PROGRESS OBSERVED IN THEIR PASSAGE FROM ONE FORM TO THE OTHER HOWEVER SMALL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE FORMS MAY APPEAR SUCH A DESCRIPTION WILL LEAD TO A BETTER KNOW LEDGE NOT ONLY OF THE PRIMITIVE CRYSTAL ITSELF BUT ALSO OF THOSE FORMS OF IT WHICH SEEM TO BE THE MOST DISTANT FROM ITS QRI GINAL ONE182 COUNT DE3OURNONS DESCRIPTION OF VERY FREQUENTLY THE TRIEDRAL PRISM PASSES TO A TETRAEDRAL MODIFICATION BY THE SIMPLE REPLACING OF ONE OF ITS EDGES BY A PLANE EQUALLY INCLINED ON THE ADJACENT ONES THIS PLANE IS EITHER VERY NARROW FIG I1 OR OF A MORE CONSIDERABLE WIDTH FIG IA SOMETIMES THE WIDTH OF THE PLANE IS SUCH THAT IT REDUCES THE PRIMITIVE ADJACENT PLANES TO EXTREME NARROWNESS FIG 13 IN THIS LAST CASE THE CRYSTAL APPEARS UNDER THE FORM OF A RECTANGULAR PLATE OR LAMINA HAVING TWO OF ITS NARROW OPPOSITE SIDES OR PLANES INCLINED IN ONE AND THE SAME DIRECTION ON ONE OF THE TWO BROAD PLANES IT SOMETIMES HAPPENS IN THIS VARIETY THAT THE TWO BROAD OPPOSITE PLANES APPROACH MORE OR LESS TO A SQUARE FORM FIG 14 I HAVE ALSO SEEN SOME CRYS TALS IN WHICH THE TWO OTHER EDGES OF THE PRISM SEEMED TO HAVE LIKEWISE VERY SLIGHT SECONDARY PLANES BUT WHEN THAT HAP PENS THEY ARE ALWAYS VERY NARROW ESPECIALLY WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SECONDARY PLANE OF THE THIRD EDGE THIS MODIFICATIONS IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS IS THE MOST COMMON ONE OF THIS SPECIES SOMETIMES ONE OF THE SOLID ANGLES OF THE TRIEDRAL PRISM IS REPLACED ON ONE SIDE ONLY BY A PLANE THAT IS MUCH INCLINED TO THE EDGE OF THE PRISM ON WHICH IT IS SITUATED  BUT THE CRYSTALS ARE ALWAYS TOO SMALL TO ADMIT OF BEING MEASURED WITH PRECISION FIG 1J THIS PLANE ASSUMING A MORE CONSIDERABLE EX TENT REPLACES THE SAME EDGE OF THE PRISM BY ANOTHER PLANE MUCH BROADER AT ONE EXTREMITY THAN THE OTHER AS IS SHEWN BY THE LINES OF LARGE DOTS IN THE SAME FIGURE SOMETIMES IT HAS A VERY CONSIDERABLE EXTENT AS IS REPRESENTED IN FIG 16 IT THEN REDUCES ONE OF THE BASES OF THE TRIEDRAL PRISM TO THE FORM OF A VERY NARROW TRAPEZIUM WHILE THAT OF THE OPPOSITE BASE REMAINS VERY BROAD BY A STILL MORE CONSIDERABLE INCREASE THE PLANE OF THIS BASE TOTALLY DISAPPEARS AND THE CRYSTAL IS TERMIGTHE ARSENZATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 3 NATED AT THAT EXTREMITY BY A RIDGE FIG I 7 IN THIS VARIETY THE CRYSTAL IS OFTEN SEEN PLACED UPON ONE OF ITS SCALENE TRIANGULAR SIDES AND THEN PRESENTS THE OTHER AT ITS UPPER EXTREMITY  AN AP PEARANCE WHICH IS APT TO PUZZLE THE OBSERVER PARTICULARLY WHEN HE PERCEIVES AMONG THE TRIANGULAR SIDES WHICH MOST GENERALLY TERMINATE THE CRYSTALS  NOTHING BUT EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES THIS MODIFICATION IN ALL ITS FORMS IS MUCH LESS COMMON THAN THE PRECEDING ONE IT IS HOWEVER OCCASIONALLY MET WITH THE MODIFICATION WHICH WE HAVE JUST SEEN THE PRIMITIVE CRYS TAL ASSUME AT ONE OF ITS SOLID ANGLES AND ONLY ON ONE SIDE SOMETIMES TAKES PLACE ALSO ONLY ON ONE SIDE AT ITS TWO OTHER ANGLES THEN IF THE ACT OF CRYSTALLIZATION HAS CONTINUED SO LONG UNDER THE SAME MODE OF INCREASE THAT THE NEW EDGES AS A B FIG I5 PRODUCED BY THE REPLACING OF THE SOLID ANGLES UNITE TOGETHER AND GIVE BIRTH TO A NEW EQUILATERAL TRI ANGLE PLACED IN A DIRECTION CONTRARY TO THE PRIMITIVE ONE AND IF AT THE SAME TIME THE CRYSTAL HAS SUCH A LENGTH THAT THE SECONDARY PLANES TERMINATE AT THE OPPOSITE BASE AND ARE VERY ACUTE ISOSCELES TRIANGLES THE CRYSTAL WILL PRESENT THE APPEAR ANCE OF A KIND OF TRUNCATED HEXAEDRAL PYRAMID THE BASE AND APEX OF WHICH WILL BE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES FIG I8 THE SIX TRIANGULAR PLANES WHICH COMPOSE THE PYRAMID OF THIS CRYSTAL ARE ALWAYS ACUTE ISOSCELES TRIANGLES BUT THREE OF THEM HAVE THEIR ACUTE ANGLE MUCH SMALLER THAN THE THREE OTHERS THE SIDES OF THE BASE OF THIS KIND OF PYRAMID ARE OPPOSITE TO THE LEAST ACUTE ANGLES AND ITS TRUNCATED APEX IS OPPOSITE TO THE MOST ACUTE ONES THE TRIANGULAR PLANES BEING PLACED ALTERNATELY IN AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION I HAVE SEEN SEVERAL INSTANCES OF THIS FORM BUT I NEVER SAW SUCH INTERMEDIATE VARIETIES AS THE184 COUNT DE BOUNNONS DESCRIPTION OF SECONDARY PLANE REPRESENTED BY THE DOTTED LINES IN FIG 1 5 WOULD GIVE IF IT EXISTED AT THE SAME TIME IN THE THREE ANGLES BY A LONGER DURATION OF THE ACT OF CRYSTALLIZATION UNDER THE SAME MODIFICATION THE PLANE CORRESPONDING TO THE TRUN CATED APEX OF THE PYRAMID FIG 18 BECOMES PROGRESSIVELY SMALLER THE MOST ACUTE ISOSCELES TRIANGULAR PLANES WHICH ANSWER TO THE SECONDARY ONES ENCROACH ON THE LEAST ACUTE ALL WHICH ARE THE PRIMITIVE PLANES OF THE CRYSTAL AND THE PYRAMID BECOMES TRULY TRIEDRAL AT ITS UPPER EXTREMITY WHILST IT REMAINS HEXAEDRAL AT THE BASE ON ACCOUNT OF THOSE PARTS OF THE THREE PLANES OF THE PRIMITIVE CRYSTAL WHICH ARE STILL PRESERVED FIG 19 BY A STILL MORE CONSIDERABLE DURATION OF THE ACT OF CRYSTAL LIZATION THE PYRAMID WOULD BECOME COMPLETELY TRIEDRAL AND WOULD NOT BE TRUNCATED AT ITS APEX I HAVE NEVER MET WITH THIS MODIFICATION SO COMPLETE BUT I HAVE SEEN THE VARIETY REPRE SENTED IN FIG 19 WHICH HOWEVER AS WELL AS FIG 18 IS VERY UNCOMMONI THE TRIEDRAL PRISM IS SUBJECT TO A FOURTH MODIFICATION WHICH TAKES PLACE AT THE THREE EDGES OF ONE OF ITS TWO BASES OR TER MINAL SURFACES ONLY AND REPLACES EACH OF THOSE EDGES BY A PLANE MUCH MRORE INCLINED ON THE SIDE OF THE PRISM ON WHICH IT IS PLACED THAN ON THE TERMINAL SURFACE FIG SO I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DETERMINE IN THESE CRYSTALS THE ANGLES FORMED BY THESE NEW PLANES EITHER WITH THE SIDES OF THE PRISM OR WITH THE TERMINAL SURFACES BUT THE VARIETIES BELONGING TO THIS MODIFICA TION DEMONSTRATE THAT THESE ANGLES ARE THE SAME AS THOSE WHICH THE SECONDARY PLANES OF THE SOLID ANGLES MAKE EITHER WITH THE TERMINAL SURFACES OR WITH THE EDGES OF  THE PRISM ON WHICHTHE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON THEY ARE INCLINED WHEN THESE NEW PLANES HAVE ACQUIRED AN INCREASE OF SUFFICIENT EXTENT TO MAKE THE PRIMITIVE PLANES OF THE PRISM TOTALLY DISAPPEAR AND TO REPLACE THEM THE CRYSTAL IS CHANGED TO A TRIEDRAL PYRAMID WITH A TRUNCATED APEX THE BASE AND TRUNCATED APEX OF WHICH ARE EQUILATERAL TRIANGLES FIG 21  WHEN IT HAPPENS THAT THE CRYSTAL HAS AT THE SAME TIME GONE THROUGH THIS MODIFICATION AND THAT WHICH REPLACES THE SOLID ANGLES OF ITS OTHER EXTREMITY AND THESE TWO MODIFICATIONS HAVE COMMENCED AT THE VERY ORIGIN OF THE FORMATION OF THE CRYSTAL THERE IS A PARTICULAR PERIOD OF ITS PROGRESS IN WHICH THE CRYSTAL IS LENGTHENED INTO A HEXAEDRAL PRISM WVITH ACUTE TRIAN GULAR ISOSCELES PLANES HAVING FOR THEIR BASES TWO EQUILATERAL TRIANGULAR PLANES PERFECTLY EQUAL FIG 22 AFTER THIS PERIOD IF THE ACT OF CRYSTALLIZATION CONTINUES THE CRYSTAL ASSUMES THE APPEARANCE OF AN EXTREMELY ACUTE RHOMBOID THE ACUTE SOLID ANGLES OF WHICH ARE REPLACED MORE OR LESS COMPLETELY BY AN EQUILATERAL TRIANGULAR PLANE FIG 23 AND FINISHES AT LAST BY TAKING THE FORM OF A PERFECT RHOMBOID FIG 24 ALL THESE VARIETIES THOUGH LESS COMMON THAN THOSE OF THE FIRST MODIFICATION ARE YET FREQUENTLY TO BE MET WITH EXCEPT ING THAT OF FIG 22 WHICH IS EXTREMELY RARE AND OF WHICH I HAVE SEEN ONLY TWO OR THREE CRYSTALS IN GENERAL HOWEVER THE CRYSTALS OF THESE VARIETIES ARE VERY SMALL AND THEIR FDRM CANNOT BE WVELL SEEN WITHOUT THE ASSISTANCE OF A MAGNIFYING GLASS IT FREQUENTLY HAPPENS THAT TWO OF THE ELONGATED TRIEDRAL PRISMS FIG IO ARE CLOSELY UNITED TO EACH OTHER BY ONE OF THE SIDES OF THE PRISM WHENCE RESULTS A KIND OF MACLE FIG 25 THE FORM OF WHICH IS A RHOMBOIDAL TETRAEDRAL PRISM OF 600 AND 1200 BUTT ERE IS ALWAYS DISCERNIBLE ON THE TERMINAL SUR MDCCCI B BI83 BCOUNT DE BOURION S DESCRPTION OF FACES OF THESE PRISMS A VERY FINE TRANSVERSE LINE A B ON THE SMALL DIAGONAL OF THE RHOMBOIDAL PLANE OF THESE SURFACES THIS LINE SHEWS THE PLACE OF UNION OF THE TWO CRYSTALS OF WHICH THE MACLE CONSISTS SOMETIMES THE TWO COMPONENT CRYSTALS OF THIS KIND OF MADE BELONG TO THE TRIEDRAL PRISM WHICH HAS A SECONDARY PLANE IN THE PLACE OF ONE OF ITS EDGES IT THEN HAS THE FORM EITHER OF A HEXAEDRAL PRISM THAT HAS FOUR OF ITS SIDES TWO AND TWXO IN OPPOSITION BROADER THAN THE OTHERS FIG G6 OR OF ONE THAT HAS ONLY TWO OPPOSITE SIDES BROADER FIG 277 OR OF A REGULAR ONE ACCORDING TO THE WIDTH OF THE SECONDARY PLANES IN ALL THESE FORMS THE LINE A B INDICATING THE PLACE OF UNION OF THE TWO CRYSTALS IS PERCEPTIBLE IT IS NOT VERY COMMON AS I HAVE ALREADY OBSERVED TO MEET WITH SPECIMENS OF THIS SPECIES IN WHICH THE CRYSTALS ARE SUFFI CIENTLY DETACHED TO LET THEIR FORM BE DISTINCTLY SEEN IN GENERAL THE CRYSTALS ARE GROUPED TOGETHER IN GREAT NUMBERS AND SEEM TO PENETRATE EACH OTHER SO AS TO FORM MAMILLA MORE OR LESS ROUND OR THEY FORM A KIND OF INDENTED CYLINDERS WHICH HAVE SOME RESEMBLANCE TO THE TRUNDLE OF A MILL IN THAT CASE THE PART OF THE CRYSTALS WHICH APPEARS AT THE SURFACE OF THESE AGGREGATIONS COMMONLY BELONGS TO ONE OF THE SIDES OF THEIR PRISM EITHER THE BROAD OR THE NARROW ONE BUT WHEN THESE AGGREGATIONS FORMSEITHER A KIND OF CYLINDERS OR OF MAMILLE IN CLUSTERS DIVERGING LIKE A FAN THERE MAY BE SEEN AT THE TWO EDGES OF THE CYLINDER OR AT THE SUMMIT OF THE CLUSTERS THE WHOLE OF THE EQUILATERAL TRIANGULAR TERMINAL PLANES OR TRAPEZIA OF ONE PART OF THE COMPONENT CRYSTALS THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS SPECIES OF ARSENIATE OF COPPER IS NEARLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE PRECEDING ONE I FOUND IT TO BETHE ARSENIATES OF COPPET AND OF IRON 187 4280 ITS HARDNESS HOWEVER IS NOT SO GREAT IT IS WITH DIFFICULTY THAT IT CAN BE MADE TO SCRATCH CALCAREOUS SPAR THE CRYSTALS OF THIS SPECIES WHEN THEY HAVE NOT UNDERGONE ANY CHANGE ARE TRANSPARENT AND OF A VERY BEAUTIFUL BLUISH GREEN COLOUR OR DEEP VERDIGRISE BUT THEIR SURFACE EASILY BECOMES DECOMPOSED AND TURNS BLACK THE CRYSTALS ARE THEN TOTALLY OPAQUE IT IS INDEED VERY SELDOM AND ONLY IN CAVITIES RECENTLY EXPOSED THAT CRYSTALS CAN BE FOUND WHICH RETAIN THEIR TRANSPARENCY AND COLOUR YET AS THE CHANGE THEY UNDERGO COMMONLY TAKES PLACE ONLY AT THE SURFACE RARELY PENETRATING TO ANY GREAT DEPTH THEIR ORIGINAL COLOUR MAY EASILY BE RE STORED MERELY BY SLIGHTLY SCRAPING THE SURFACE WITH A SHARP INSTRUMENT THE ABOVE IS THE ONLY CHANGE I HAVE HAD OCCASION TO REMARK IN THIS SPECIES SOMETIMES BUT VERY RARELY THIS SPECIES IS FOUND IN THE FORM OF SMALL HAIR PENCILS WITH VERY DELICATE FIBRES AND AS IN THE SPE CIMENS IN WHICH I OBSERVED THIS VARIETY THE LITTLE FIBROUS TUFT HAD PRESERVED ITS BEAUTIFUL VERDIGRISE COLOUR NOTHING COULD EXCEED THE BEAUTY OF THEIR APPEARANCE I HAVE LIKEWISE OBSERVED THIS SPECIES IN A MAMILLARY FORM WITH A COMPACT TEXTURE BUTTTHIS VARIETY LIKE THE PRECEDING IS EXTREMELY RARE THE MATRIX OF THIS ARSENIATE OF COPPER IS THE SAME AS THAT OF ALL THE PRECEDING SPECIES AND THAT SPECIES WHICH IS MOST FREQUENTLY FOUND WITH IT IS THE ARSENIATE IN OBTUSE OCTAEDRA IT IS ALSO FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIED WITH THAT KIND OF ORE WHICH IS KNOWN BY THE NAME OF AZURE COPPER ORE BB X188 COUNT DE BOURNONS DESCRIPTION OF SECTION II ARSENIATES OF IRON MUTTRELL MINE WHICH IS IMM EDIATELY CONTIGUOUS TO HUEL GORLAND MINE IN THE COUNTY OF CORNWALL HAS PRODUCED SOME SPECIMENS OF ARSENIATES OF COPPER EXACTLY SIMILAR TO THOSE DE SCRIBED IN THE FORMER PART OF THIS PAPER BUT THIS MINE IS STILL MORE INTERESTING TO MINERALOGISTS ON ACCOUNT OF A COMBINATION FOUND THEREIN OF ARSENIC ACID WITH IRON AND ALSO A DOUBLE COM BINATION OF THAT ACID WITH BOTH IRON AND COPPER THE FIRST MENTIONED OF THESE ARSENIATES SEEMS ANALOGOUS TO THOSE CRYSTALS OR CUBES OF A FINE GREEN COLOUR OF WHICH SOME SPE CIMENS HAD ALREADY BEEN FOUND IN CARRARACH AND TRINCROFT NINES AND WHICH KLAPROTIH IN HIS MEMOIR UPON THE MINERALOGY OF CORNWALL CONSIDERED AS BELONGING TO THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER BUT ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS MADE BY MR CHENEVIX WITH ALL THE CARE WHICH HIS EXTENSIVE KNOWLEDGE AND EXTREME ZEAL FOR SCIENCE WOULD NATURALLY LEAD HIM TO EMPLOY IT APPEARS TO BE A TRUE ARSENIATE OF IRON CONTAINING ONLY A SMALL QUANTITY OF COPPER AND EVEN THAT QUANTITY SEEMS TO BE MERELY AN ACCI DENTAL MIXTURE AS IN THE SPECIMENS FROM THE OLD MINES OF TINCROFT AND CARRARACH THE GREATEST PART OF THE CRYSTALS AD HERED TO VITREOUS GREY COPPER ORE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOME PAR TICLES OF THAT ORE REMAINED ATTACHED TO THE CRYSTALS OR AS I HAVE FREQUENTLY FOUND TO BE THE CASE THAT SOME SUCH PARTICLES HAD PENETRATED INTO THE CRYSTALS AND THAT MR KLAPROTHI HAD BEEN THEREBY DECEIVED BY FINDING IN THE BUTTON LEFT BY THE BLOWPIPE A MUCH GREATER PROPORTION OF COPPER THAN THIS ORETHE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRONI 189 REALLY CONTAINS THE NATURAL DECOMPOSITION OF THIS ARSENIATE WHICH PRODUCES AN OXIDE OF IRON OF A FINE REDDISH YELLOW COLOUR STRONGLY CONFIRMS THE RESULT OF MR CHENEVIXS ANALYSIS GMELIN IN HIS PRINCIPLES OF MINERALOGY PRINTED AT GOTTIN GEN IN THE YEAR 1790 HAD ALREADY SUPPOSED THAT THESE CRYS TALS COULD NOT BELONG TO THE SUBSTANCE WHICH IN MINERALOGICAL PUBLICATIONS HAD BEEN CALLED ARSENICAL COPPER ORE HE HAD CONSEQUENTLY SEPARATED THEM LEAVING THEM HOWEVER AMONG THE ORES OF COPPER UNDER THE NAME OF TWIRFEL ERTZ THE DOUBLE COMBINATION OF THE ARSENIC ACID WITH IRON AND COPPER ALTHOUGH IT HAD APPEARED TO EXIST IN THE ARSENIATE JUST SPOKEN OF IN THE MINES OF TINCROFT AND CARRARACH HAD NOT EXCITED THE ATTENTION OF MINERALOGISTS IT IS HOWEVER POSSIBLE THAT THE TRANSPARENCY THE BRILLIANCY AND THE PALE BLUE COLOUR OF ITS CRYSTALS MIGHT OCCASION THEM TO BE MISTAKEN FOR CRYSTALS OF A STONY NATURE BESIDES THEIR SMALLNESS MIGHT EASILY CAUSE THEM TO ESCAPE THE NOTICE OF COMMON OBSERVATION PARTICULARLY WHEN THEY ARE NOT IN PRETTY LARGE GROUPS THE MATRIX OF THESE TWO ARSENIATES IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE ARSENIATES OF COPPER CONSISTING LIKE THAT OF QUARTZ MIXED WITH YELLOW GREY AND VITREOUS ORES OF COPPER WITH OXIDES OF IRON AND WITH MISPICKEL THE MINES OF HUEL GOR LAND AND MUTTRELL ALTHOUGH NOT SITUATED IN THE DISTRICT OF THE TIN MINES HAVE YET PRODUCED SOME SPECIMENS OF TIN THE CRYST TALS OF WHICH ARE COVERED WITH THOSE OF THE ARSENIATE HERE SPOKEN OF TWO SPECIMENS OF THIS FKIND ARE IN THE COLLECTION OF SIR JOHN 8CR AUBYNI9O COUNT DE BOURNONS3 DESCRLPTZO AF SPECIES I SIMPLEARSENIATE OF IRON HLLIS SPECIES CRYSTALLIZES IN PERFECT CUBES  FIG 28 PLATE XV SOMETIMES THOUGH RARELY THEY ARE A LITTLE FLATTENED THEIR SIDES ARE SMOOTH AND BRILLIANT THE ONLY MODIFICATION I HAVE OBSERVED IN THIS FORM IS THAT FOUR OF THE EIGHT SOLID ANGLES OF THE CUBE ARE REPLACED BY AN EQUAL NUMBER OF EQUILATERAL TRIANGULAR PLANES SITUATED IN SUCH A MANNER THAT EVERY ONE OF THE SIDES OF THE CUBE BECOMES AN ELONGATED HEXAGON HAVING TWO ANGLES OF 9QO EACH AND FOUR OF I J FIG S9 CRYSTALS MODIFIED IN THIS WAY ARE VERY SCARCE I HAVE NEVER SEEN BUT ONE SUCH SPECIMEN WHICH IS IN THE COLLECTION OF SIR JOHN ST AUBYN THE CRYSTALS OF IT ARE PRETTY LARGE AND VERY WELL DEFINED THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS SPECIES IS 3000 ITS HARDNESS IS JUST SUFFICIENT TO SCRATCH CALCAREOUS SPAR ITS CRYSTALS WHICH ARE TOLERABLY TRANSPARENT ARE OF A DARK GREEN COLOUR WITH A BROWNISH TINGE SOMETIMES THEY ARE RATHER YELLOWISH AND THERE EXIST SOME SPECIMENS OF A BROWNYELLOW COLOUR LIKE RESIN I HAVE NEVER SEEN THIS SPECIES IN ANY OTHER STATE THAN THAT OF PERFECT CRYSTALLIZATION SOMETIMES INDEED A DECOMPOSITION TAKES PLACE WHICH CAUSES THE CRYSTALS TO PASS INTO THE STATE OF A PULVERULENT OXIDE OF A LINE REDDISH YELLOW COLOUR IN THIS CASE AS THE BULK OF THE CRYSTALS IS CONSIDERABLY DIMINISHED THERE IS PERCEIVED UPON BREAKING THEM A CONSIDERABLE NUMBER OF SMALL CAVITIES IN THEIR SUBSTANCE THESE CAVITIES ARE ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH APPEAR IN THE CRYSTALS OF THE SPATHOSE ORES OF IRON WHEN THEY HAVE PASSED INTO A SIMILAR STATE OF DECOMPOSITIONTLE ARSENIATES OF COPPER AND OF IRON 19T SPECIES IL CUPREOUS ARSENIATE OF IRON THE CRYSTALS OF THIS SPECIES ARE OF UNCOMMON BRILLIANCY AND ARE PERFECTLY TRANSPARENT THEIR FORM IS A RHOMBOIDAL TETRA EDRAL PRISM HAVING TWO OF ITS EDGES VERY OBTUSE AND THE OTHER TWO VERY ACUTE BUT OWING TO THE MINUTE SIZE OF THESE CRYSTALS I HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO DETERMIINE THE MEASURE OF THEIR ANGLES THE PRISM IS TERMINATED AT EACH OF ITS EXTREMITIES BY A TETRAEDRAL PYRAMID WHICH IS PRETTY SHARP AND ITS PLANES WHICH ARE SCALENE TRIANGLES UNITE BY PAIRS FORMING ELONGATED RIDGES WHICH JOIN THE ACUTE EDGES OF THE PRISM IN THE OTHER DIRECTION THEY UNITE ALSO BY PAIRS SO AS TO FORM A RIDGE WHICH IS LESS ELONGATED AND JOINS THE OBTUSE EDGES VERY OFTEN THE OBTUSE EDGES OF THE PRISM ARE REPLACED BY PLANES OF GREATER OR LESS EXTENT EQUALLY INCLINED UPON THE ADJACENT ONES FIG 31 SOMETIMES THE ACUTE EDGES ARE ALSO REPLACED IN THE SAME MAN NER BUT ALWAYS BY PLANES OF LESS EXTENT FIG 32 THE ABOVE ARE THE ONLY VARIETIES I HAVE OBSERVED OF THIS ARSENIATE ITS CRYSTALS SELDOM OCCUR SINGLY BEING GENERALLY GROUPED TOGETHER IN A VERY IRREGULAR MANNER SOMETIMES HOW EVER THEY ARE SO UNITED AS TO ASSUME A MAMILLATED FORM HAVING THE PYRAMIDS OF THE CRYSTALS WHICH COMPOSE THE MAMILLH ALL PLACED UPON THE SURFACE THEREOF THE SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF THIS ARSENIATE IS 3400 ITS HARDNESS IS RATHER GREATER THAN THAT OF THE SIMPLE ARSE NIATE OF IRON  IT SCRATCHES CALCAREOUS SPAR WITH GREATER

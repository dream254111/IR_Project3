FOUNDATION FOR TEACHERS A SUGGESTION CONSIDERABLE criticism has been raised in this journal in regard to the method of admin istration of the pension system for teachers established by Mr Carnegie The purpose 482 SCIENCEOCTOBER 2 1914 SCIENCE seems to be that teaching only of the higher grade should be rewarded by the foundation In judging the grade of teaching however the character of the institution where the teacher happens to be located and not the work of the individual teacher himself is used as the basis of selection The present note is to suggest for discussion the desirability of changing the viewpoint and using the work of the teacher rather than the institution as the unit of selection Success of service in the teaching profession is properly recognized for two main reasons First as a reward for past service and second as a stimulus for attracting and developing higher grade men in the profession The re ward would be more just if apportioned ac cording to the individual service rendered and the stimulus would be greater upon such a basis The indifferent men in accepted insti tutions may be less worthy of reward and more in need of stimulus than many in un selected institutions Undoubtedly one of the chief reasons for making the institution the unit of selection is the apparent relative ease of classifying insti tutions and administrating the system upon this basis The difficulties of classifying and administrating upon the individual basis how ever are not insurmountable The best judge of the success of service in teaching is the opinion of teachers themselves In  American Men of Science 1000 men from the entire body of scientists are listed as of preeminent rank the number apportioned to each depart ment being in proportion to the total number of scientists that it contains The essential value of this starred list is the method of its selection Those starred are thus ranked by the combined vote of the leading scientists in the particular department which they rep resent Such a method of selecting individuals could be extended to include all the depart ments of teaching The number that the foundation is able to directly benefit can be determined and the list of beneficiaries can then be prepared accordingly but be selected by the teachers themselves Under the present system the value of the pension may seldom if ever be directly dis counted from a teachers salary but to the writers knowledge the fact of an institution being accepted by the foundation has been offered either as an excuse for a low scale of reward or as an inducement to change insti tutions without rise in salary Giving the pension through preferred institutions has little or no influence as encouragement to do better work for those already in these select institutions and for individuals outside the fold is of influence only as it causes them to attempt to get upon the preferred institutions even at a sacrifice Objection may be raised to the selection of individuals that such a method gives undue prominence to research and publications In the grade of institutions for which the Car negie Foundation is intended research and publication is considered as one of the neces sary activities of a good teacher Publication broadens the class room and increases the number of scholars making the influence of the teacher international and not merely local The good teacher further is known by his scholars and by his colleagues It would be impossible therefore for the worthy teacher to escape recognition by a jury of his peers It is not desirable to discuss here further the possibilities of the scheme suggested nor to point out the possible influence that a recog nized list of teachers might exert upon a more direct adjustment of positions to merit than is at present in vogue in many American colleges and universities What has been written is sufficient as a suggestion A F BLAKESLEE CONN AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE STORRS CONN

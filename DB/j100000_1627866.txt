the isocyanids can be converted into cyanids are illustrated by the flask of putrified blood nitrils by heat Since the formation of nitrils from which Pasteur obtained the anaerobic in the above interaction is thus accounted for microbe which he called the vibrion septique one of the chief arguments for the nitrilic con Ushaped tubes from Pasteurs laboratory con stitution HCN of hydrogen cyanid disappears taining anthrax blood with samples of the first and it seems possible that HNC represents the and second vaccines against anthrax as sup constitution of the acid and that all the

Advancement of Science calls attention approvingly to a movement to associate meet ings of this Greekletter society with those of Association The rapid rise of the Sigma Xi in American universities is cited and it is af firmed that  as an honor society it promises to take a leading part in our universities in which science holds a prominent placeI It is urged that I it has become a representative honor society for the ablest students of science in the institutions where it is established Respect ing its intent the following authoritative quo tation is made  In establishing a new chapter    in each case we should make sure that we entrust the power of distributing the honor of membership only to such persons and insti tutions as are capable of giving the education and training necessary to the carrying on of scientific investigation It is scarcely necessary to make these quota tions to show that the fundamental feature of the Society is the promotion of a class distinc tion based on academic preparation How ever laudable this may be in itself considered Editorial article from the American Journal of Geology N S VOL XII No 292 it would seem to be inharmonious with the fundamental purpose of the Association which is the development and dissemination of science among all people without regard to race age sex or previous conditions of intellectual servi tude From professional relations the writer should not be inappreciative of the value of uni versity training and of academic achievement Nevertheless it seems to him that the pur poses of the Association are unqualifiedly democratic and that the spirit of science is equally so and that therefore the only distinc tions which the Association should foster or sanc tion if it fosters or sanctions distinctions at all are those which are based solely upon scientific productiveness And this productiveness should be honored quite irrespective of its connection with the fortunate conditions of academic ap pointments and opportunities or with the ad verse or even hostile conditions under which much good science has been developed The movement therefore to connect the Sigma Xi with those of the American Association seems incongruous As set forth in another article in the same number of SCIENCE some fifteen special scien tific societies have already become correlated with the Association and have much increased the complexity of the proceedings This move ment seems to be an inevitable consequence of the differentiation of scientific work and is scarcely less than necessary to the continued success of the Association but it has already brought some inevitable conflict of interests and not a little congestion of programs and appointments Between these and the in creased number of social functions it has already come to pass that there is little time left for that personal conference and that in formal sociability whose basis is shop talk which formed so large a factor in the attrac tiveness of the earlier meetings of the Associa tion If now in addition to these laudable complications the attention of a considerable number of the members of the Association is to be diverted in the interest of an academic honor society and a precedent established for the meeting of other societies whose basis is not strictly congenial to that of the Association

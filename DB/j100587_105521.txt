MYNDE 39 THE PUBLIC HATH OF LATE BEEN A GREEABLY ENTERTAINED WITH DESCRIP TIONS OF MANY CURIOUS FOSSILS DISCOVERED IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS KINGDOM BUT VERY LITTLE HATH BEEN OF FERED WITH A VIEW TO ASCERTAIN THEIR ORIGIN AND FORMA TION A POINT OF MUCH GREATER IMPORTANCE TO A CURI OUS MIND THAN THE MOST ACCURATE DESCRIPTIONS OR THE NEATEST DELINEATIONS IT MAY INDEED BE THOUGHT UN NECESSARY AT THIS TIME TO SAY ANY THING OF THE ORIGIN OF EXTRANEOUS FOSSILS IN GENERAL ALL OUR MODERN NATURALISTS BEING FULLY CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE THE EXUVIAE OR REMAINS OF ANIMALS AND VEGETABLES AND THE GREATER PART OF THEM OF MARINE PRODUCTION READ JAN 26 1764 BUT AS TO THEIR PARTICULAR ORIGIN AND FORMATION IN WHAT MANNER THEY WERE PRODUCED IN THE RECENT AND HOW AND WITH WHAT MATTER THEY AFTERWARDS BE CAME IMPREGNATED IN THEIR FOSSIL STATE ALL THIS IS A FIELD OF NATURAL INQUIRY THAT HAS BEEN VERY MUCH NEG LECTED NOTWITHSTANDING IT IS THE MOST FERTILE AND PRO DUCTIVE OF USEFUL AND ENTERTAINING KNOWLEDGE BE SIDES WERE WE TO CONSIDER IT IN THIS VIEW THE RECENT AND FOSSIL REMAINS WOULD BE FOUND TO THROW A MUTUAL LIGHT UPON EACH OTHER AND THE NATURALIST WOULD NOT BE SO OFTEN AT A LOSS TO CLASS EVERY NEW FOSSIL ACQUISITION OF WHICH THE RECENT SPECIMEN IS NOT TO BE FOUND ESPECI ALLY WHENEVER THE FOSSIL HAS ANY THING SEEMINGLY AEQUIVOCAL IN ITS FORMATION SO AS ON A SUPERFICIAL IM SPECTION TO RENDER THE MATTER DOUBTFUL WHETHER THE BODY BELONGS TO THE ANIMAL OR VEGETABLE KINGDOMS OR INDEED TO EITHER OF THEM ONE OF THE FIRST NOTE IS THE BELEMNITE WHICH HAS NOT UNTIL VERY LATELY BEEN EVEN RANKED AMONGST THE MARINE PRODUCTIONS BUT40 BUT WHOSE ORIGIN AND FORMATION HAVE NEVER YET BEEN FULLY EXPLAINED I SHALL NOT ENTER INTO A MINUTE DETAIL OF THE SEVERAL SPECIES OF THE BELEMNITE THE HISTORY OF THIS EXTRANEOUS FOSSIL OR AN ATTEMPT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ORIGIN AND FORMATION OF THE BELEMNITE SO FAR AS THEY CAN BE DISCOVERED AND CONFIRMED BY REASONINGS DRAWN FROM FACTS AND EXPERIENCE IS THE OBJECT OF THE PRESENT ENQUIRY I SHALL THEREFORE CONFINE MY SELF TO TWO SPECIES OF THE BELEMNITE THE ONE COM MON IN MOST COUNTIES OF THIS KINGDOM AND VULGARLY KNOWN BY THE NAME OF THUNDERBOLT A THE OTHER THAT OF THE FUSIFORM OR SPINDLEKIND B FOUND IN SLATESTONE AT STONSFIELD BUT IN FAR GREATER PLENTY IN THE CLAY NEAR PIDDINGTON C OXFORDSHIRE AND IN THE CHALKPITS OF KENT AND SURREY D THOSE IN CHALK HAVE BEEN OFTEN MISTAKEN FOR SPINES OF THE SEAHEDGEHOG OR ECHINUS OVARIUS BUT THE CHARAC TERISTICS OF THESE TWO BODIES ARE WIDELY DIFFERENT THE BELEMNITE BREAKS IN A DIRECTION PERPENDICULAR TO ITS AXIS E THE SPINE OBLIQUELY F THE BE LEMNITE WHEN BROKEN EXHIBITS CENTRAL RAYS THE SPINE A SMOOTH RESPLENDENT SURFACE THIS DISTINCTION IS INVARIABLE IF THE TRIAL BE REPEATED A THOUSAND TIMES THESE DIFFERENT APPEARANCES ARE PROBABLY THE EFFECTS OF DIFFERENT FORMATIONS AND THEREFORE THE BELEMNITE SEEMS TO BE FORMED BY APPOSITION AND THE ACULEUS OR SPINE BY PROTRUSION OR AS MR REAUMUR CALLS IT BY INTUSSUSCEPTION THE RADII IN THE BELEMNITE ARE OWING TO THE FINE LAMINAE OF WHICH IT IS COMPOSED THEY ARE SO VERY THIN AND BREAK SO NEARLY ALIKE THAT THEY HAVE EVER AN HORIZONTAL SURFACE WHEN BROKEN A T A B III FIG 1 B FIG 2 C FIG 3 D FIG 4 E FIG 5 F FIG 6 WHICH41 WHICH IS COMMON TO ALL THE SHELLS OF THE TRICHITE KIND G THE SPINE BEING FORMED BY PROTRUSION ITS COMPONENT PARTS ARE ADJUSTED ON A DIFFERENT MANNER AND THE PORES LIKE THE CANCELLI IN BONES THOUGH NOT SO DISTINCT ARE IRREGULAR WHICH IS THE REASON OF ITS BREAK ING OBLIQUELY IN ANY DIRECTION BUT IT IS GENERALLY SMOOTH BY BEING SATURATED WITH A PLATED KIND OF SPAR H MY INGENIOUS AND VERY WORTHY FRIEND MR BRANDER IN A DISSERTATION ON THE BELEMNITE PRESENTED TO THE ROYAL SOCIETY I JUSTLY OBSERVES  THAT THE BE  LEMNITE BELONGS TO THE TESTACEOUS PART OF THE ANI  MAL KINGDOM AND TO THE FAMILY OF THE NAUTILI AND I WOULD BEG LEAVE FARTHER TO ADD THAT THIS GEN TLEMANS SENTIMENTS ARE GREATLY STRENGTHENED BY THE SURPRISING ANALOGY WHICH THE BELEMNITE BEARS TO THE LITTLE PEARLY CONCAMERATED SHELL OR CORNU AMMONIS AND THE ORTHOCERATITES TO THE LARGE NAUTILUS THE FORMER HAVING ITS SIPHUNCULUS UPON THE VERGE AS THE LATTER HAS IT IN THE CENTER OF THE DIAPHRAGM OR PARTITION OF EACH CELL OR CHAMBER  IT HAS INDEED BEEN TRULY MATTER OF SPECULATION CONTINUES MR BRANDER HOW THIS HUGE SOLID SUBSTANCE CALLED THE BELEMNITE EXCLUSIVE OF THE NUCLEUS COULD BE FORMED AND HOW IT HAPPENS THAT SOME BELEMNITES SHOULD HAVE THE NUCLEUS WITHIN THEM OTHERS NOT THE CAVITY TO G FIG 7 A PIECE OF THE PENNA MARINA PERFORATED BY THE PHOLADES H SPAR SEEMS TO BE NOTHING BUT CRYSTAL DEBASED BY A CAL CAREOUS EARTH THE MORE DEBASED SORT BREAKS IN A HAIRY TRICHITE MAN NER THE MORE PELLUCID KIND WITH A SMOOTH SURFACE AND ALWAYS IN AN OBLIQUE RHOMBOIDAL DIRECTION WHICH PERHAPS MAY IN SOME MEASURE ENABLE US TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS DOUBLE REFRACTION I PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS VOL XLVIII FOR 1754 PAGE 803 G CONTAIN42 CONTAIN THE SAME IN SOME VERY SMALL IN OTHERS SCARCE OR NOT AT ALL VISIBLE  BUT I FLATTER MYSELF THAT IT WILL BE FOUND UPON ENQUIRY THAT THESE ARE ONLY CIR CUMSTANCES WHICH ARE COMMON TO OTHER TESTACEOUS BODIES THAT HAVE BEEN ACCIDENTALLY BROKEN OR DECAYED BY TIME WHEN FORSAKEN BY THEIR INHABITANTS FOR NO TESTACEOUS BODY CAN BE FORMED WITHOUT AN INHABITANT NOR DOES IT APPEAR TO ME THAT ANY BELEMNITE WAS EVER FORMED WITHOUT AN ALVEOLUS OR CONCAMERATED SHELL THE CONICAL CAVITY AND ITS NUCLEUS ARE ALWAYS PRO PORTIONED TO THE BULK OF THE BELEMNITE BUT NOT TO ITS LENGTH SOME ARE FOUR TIMES LONGER IN PROPORTION TO THE ALVEOLUS THAN OTHERS THE APEX OF THE CONICAL CAVITY WHERE THE ALVEOLUS IS FIRST FORMED IN SOME RUNS UP ABOUT HALF THE LENGTH OF THE WHOLE BELEMNITE IN OTHERS NOT A SIXTH PART OF THE WHOLE K BUT THE APERTURE OR UPPER CHAMBER L IS EQUALLY PROPORTIONABLE TO THE BULK OR CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE BELEMNITE OF WHATSOVER SIZE OR SHAPE AND IS THE SEAT M OR DWELL INGPLACE OF THE ANIMAL THAT FORMS THE BELEMNITE IN WHATMANNER THIS WORK IS EXECUTED I SHALL NOW ENDEA VOUR TO EXPLAIN A CONSIDERABLE PART OF MARINE BODIES ESPECIALLY THOSE OF THE TESTACEOUS TRIBE ARE GENERALLY BURIED IN MUD OR SAND EXCEPT SOME FEW WHICH STICK TO ROCKS C AS THE LIMPETS AND PERIWINCLES BY WHICH MEANS WE ARE PREVENTED FROM MAKING THOSE REMARKS UPON THE SEVERAL STAGES OF THEIR GROWTH WHICH AN ACCURATE ENQUIRER WOULD DESIRE WE MUST THEREFORE HAVE RE K FIG 8 L FIG XIII B C M WE NEVER FIND A BELEMNITE WITH PART OF THE ALVEOLUS BUT THE VESTIGIA OR MARKS OF THE REMAINDER APPEAR IN THE CAVITY AND ARE CONTINUED TO THE VERGE OF IT COURSE43 COURSE TO THE DIFFERENT STEPS OR PERIODS OF THEIR LIFE AND GROWTH AS THEY ARE MARKED OUT BY THE INDENTED LIPS OR FOLDINGS OF THE SHELL UNTILL THEY ARRIVE AT THEIR FULL SIZE WHEN THEY BEGIN TO FORTIFY THEM SELVES BY BULWARKS AND STRONG HOLDS AGAINST THE INJURIES AND INCIDENTS WHICH ATTEND OLD AGE THIS IS MOST CONSPICUOUS IN THE COWREE OR CONCHA VENERIS OF LISTER BOOK IV SECT 9 MR REAUMUR N FOUND BY REPEATED EXPERIMENTS THAT LAND SNAILS FORM THEIR SHELLS BY JUXTAPOSITION AS THE ANIMAL GROWS IN BULK THE SHELL IS INCREASED BY A MUCOUS MATTER EMITTED FROM THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL WHIC HHARDENS BY DEGREES INTO A TESTACEOUS SUBSTANCE AND FROM THE EXPERIMENTS UPON LAND SHELLS THAT GREAT NATURALIST CONCLUDES BY ANALOGY THAT ALL TESTACEOUS BODIES ARE FORMED IN THE LIKE MANNER PARTICULARLY THOSE OF THE TURBINATED KIND TO THIS GENERAL RULE AN OBJECTION IS MADE BY MR POUPART FROM THE FORMATION OF THE COWREE OR CON CHA VENERIS BEFORE MENTIONED BUT THIS LEARNED GEN TLEMAN WAS NOT AWARE THAT THIS SHELL IS FIRST A BUCCINUM FORMING MANY CONVOLUTIONS BEFORE IT DRAWS IN THE VERGE TO FORM THE INDENTED LIP IT WAS THIS VERY OBJECTION OF MR POUPART WHICH LED ME TO EXAMINE INTO THE GROWTH OF THE COWREE AND BY SAWING ONE OF THEM THROUGH THE MIDDLE I FOUND A TURBINATED SHELL WITHIN THE OUTER WALL CONSISTING OF SIX OR SEVEN CONVOLUTIONS BUT NO STAGES OR PERIODS OF THE INDENTED LIP APPEARED IN ANY OF THE CONVOLU TIONS AS WE FIND IN THE HELMET SHELL AND SEVERAL OF THE BUCCINAE I THEN BEGAN TO CONSIDER HOW THIS ANIMAL ENLARGED ITS DWELLING AND WAS FULLY CONVINCED THAT N SEE HIS BOOK OF INSECTS G 2 NO44 NO MORE CONVOLUTIONS COULD BE CARRIED ON THE IN DENTED LIPS BEING A FULL STOP TO ITS INWARD DIMENSIONS AND THAT HERE WAS THE PERIOD OF ITS GROWTH MY SENTIMENTS WERE JUST AS TO ITS INWARD DIMENSION BUT OBSERVING THAT THE LIPS OF SOME WERE MUCH LARGER THAN OTHERS AND THAT THE CURVED PART OF THE OUTER LIP APPEARED THICKER WHEN SAWED OPEN THAN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SHELL I BEGAN TO THINK THAT THE ANIMAL INSTEAD OF ENLARGING THE INNER DIMENSIONS WAS EMPLOYED IN THICKENING THE OUTER WALL TO GUARD AGAINST INJURIES AND ACCIDENTS SO COMMON TO THE INHABITANTS OF THAT TURBULENT ELEMENT THE SEA I WAS THE MORE CONFIRMED IN THESE SENTIMENTS BY SEEING THE BEAUTIFUL SPOTS WITH WHICH THIS ANIMAL DECORATES ITS HOUSE COVERED BY OTHER SPOTS OF DIFFERENT COLOUR AND SIZE AS NEW LAMINAE WERE ADDED TO STRENGTHEN THE LASTFORMED CONVOLUTION IT IS REALLY MATTER OF ADMIRATION TO SEE HOW THESE SHELLS ARE ADORNED AND VARIEGATED THE EXQUISITE POLISH WHICH COVERS THE WHOLE INFINITELY SURPASSING THE SKILL EVEN OF THE MOST ACCOM PLISHED HUMAN ARTIST THESE NEW COVERINGS OR LA MINAE WHICH ARE CARRIED FROM THE LIPS TERMINATE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE BACK PART OF THE SHELL AND THERE FORM A LIST OR SEAM OF A QUITE DIFFERENT COLOUR FROM THAT OF THE OTHER PART OF THE SHELL AND OF AN UNEQUAL SURFACE THIS VERY CIRCUMSTANCE GAVE BIRTH TO MY SENTIMENTS CONCERNING THE FORMATION OF THE BELEMNITE FOR WHO EVER CONSIDERS THE SEAM OR SULCUS IN THE BELEMNITE WILL I THINK CONCLUDE WITH ME THAT THE OUTWARD LAMINA IS FORMED LATEST AS IN THE COWREE AND THAT THE SEAM OR SULCUS IS CAUSED BY THE SEVERAL ADDITIONAL COVERINGS OR LAMINAE TERMINATING THERE BUT AS THE ANATOMIST MAKES FRESH DISCOVERIES BY DISSECTING THE SUBJECT45 SUBJECT SO IF I MAY BE ALLOWED THE COMPARISON I RECEIVED FARTHER INFORMATION BY LUCKILY MEETING WITH A BELEMNITE WHOSE LAMINAE WERE IN A MANNER DISSECTED AND LAID OPEN BY THE VAGUE ACID OR SOME OTHER COR RODING MENSTRUUM WHICH EVERY WHERE PERVADES THE EARTH DESTROYING SOME BODIES O AND FORMING OTHERS P THE LAMINAE OF THIS TRULY WONDERFUL BODY ARE HERE EXPOSED TO VIEW Q AND PLAINLY SHEW US THAT NATURE IN THIS AS IN ALL HER WORKS PURSUES THE MOST SIMPLE EASY AND SHORTEST METHODS THOUGH THEY APPEAR EVER SO INTRICATE AND INTERWOVEN THIS SPECIMEN WILL I HOPE SERVE TO EXPLAIN A MATTER WHICH HATH SO LONG PUZZLED THE CURIOUS IN NATURAL HISTORY AND CONVINCE US THAT THERE IS NOTHING MORE WONDER FUL IN THE FORMATION OF THE BELEMNITE THAN IN THAT OF A COCKLE OYSTER OR ANY OTHER TESTACEOUS SUB STANCE WITH THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY THE OYSTER STRENGTHENS ITS SHELL AND EXCLUDES ITS FIRST HABITATION BY ADDITIONAL LAMINAE FORMED WITHIN THE BELEMNITE INCLOSES ITS DWELLING BY ADDING NEW LAMINAE WITHOUT FIGURE X REPRESENTS THE BELEMNITE SPLIT UP THE MIDDLE WITH THE

TO ACCOUNT FOR THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS AND BROKEN PARTS OF THE BELEMNITE AND IN WHAT MANNER THEY WERE REDUCED TO THE SEVERAL FORMS OR APPEARANCES IN WHICH WE COM MONLY FIND THEM THE BETTER TO ILLUSTRATE MY CONJECTURE I SHALL FIRST EXHIBIT SOME DRAWINGS WHICH SHEW THE SEVERAL SPE CIMENS BROKEN AND IMPERFECT AND THEN PROPOSE MY SENTIMENTS CONCERNING THEM BEFORE THEY WERE DESERTED BY THEIR INHABITANTS FIGURE 6 SHEWS THE SPINE OF THE ECHINUS OVARIUS BROKEN OBLIQUELY AS IS COMMON TO ALL OF THEM FIGURE 5 EXHIBITS THE INWARD STRUC TURE OF THE BELEMNITE WHEN BROKEN HORIZONTALLY WITH THE

IS THE TERMINATION OF THE CONICAL CAVITY HAS BEEN THOUGHT TO BE THE SOCKET OF THE SPINE WHICH RECEIVES THE PAPILLA WHEN GROWING TO THE ECHINUS BUT WHEN COMPARED WITH THE SOCKET OF THE TRUE SPINE S WE FIND IT WIDELY DIFFERENT THE PRICKED LINES B C B C SHEW WHAT THE FUSIFORM BELEMNITE WAS WHEN PERFECT WITH THE ALVEOLUS D E MANY OF R THESE DISTINCTIONS OF THE LAMINAE I PRESUME TO BE OWING TO THE MINERAL STEAMS INSINUATING THEMSELVES INTO THE BELEMNITE WHEN THE SPAR PERVADED THE PORES AND DESTROYED THE TEXTURE BUT RETAINED THE TRUE FORM BY SUBSTITUTING ITS SELF AND FILLING THE PLASM OR MOULD OF THE BELEMNITE S FIG 6 B I THOSE47 THOSE FOUND IN CHALK SEEM TO BE SOMEWHAT INJURED AT THE END A WHERE THEY ARE DEFICIENT AND ARE ROUNDED BUT HAVE AN UNEVEN FURFACE AS IF THEY HAD BEEN GNAWED OR EATEN BY THE PHOLAS THOSE FOUND IN CLAY NEAR PIDDINGTON T OXFORDSHIRE APPROACH NEARER TO THE FUSIFORM KIND AND HAVE A DIFFERENT APPEARANCE AT THE SMALLER END F WHERE THE LAMINAE ARE REDUCED TO A WHITE IMPALPABLE POWDER BY CORROSIVE JUICES IN THE EARTH SO AS TO STAIN THE FINGERS WHEN FIRST TAKEN OUT AND THEY AFTERWARDS RETAIN A WHITE CHALKY AP PEARANCE BUT AMONGST A GREAT NUMBER I NEVER FOUND ONE THAT WAS THREE INCHES LONG THESE HAVE SUFFERED IN THE SAME MANNER AS FIG IV FIG 3 F SHEWS WHERE THE ALVEOLUS TERMINATES G H G H HOW MUCH HAS BEEN DESTROYED BY VITRIOLIC ACIDS U AT STONSFIELD THEY ARE FOUND MUCH LONGER THAN AT PIDDINGTON AND ARE INCLOSED IN STONE WHICH IS SPLIT BY THE WORKMEN TO MAKE SLATES HERE WE OFTEN FIND T FIG 3 U IT MAY BE ASKED WHY ONE PART SUFFERS MORE THAN ANOTHER AS ALL PARTS ARE HOMOGENEOUS AND FREE FROM EXTRANEOUS MIXTURES MY ANSWER IS BECAUSE THOSE PARTS WHERE THE CONCAMERATED SHELL IS LODGED ARE MUCH THINNER THAN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BELEM NITE AND CONSEQUENTLY THE WALLS ARE MORE EASILY BROKEN DOWN AND THE ALVEOLUS BEING STILL LESS SOLID IS SOONER DESTROYED AND RE DUCED TO AN IMPALPABLE POWDER BY VITROLIC AND OTHER ACIDS WHICH THE WATER TAKES UP AS IT PASSES THROUGH DIFFERENT STRATA ABOUNDING MORE OR LESS WITH PYRITICAL MATTER WHERE NO SPAR FOLLOWS THE ACID THE PARTS ARE CARRIED AWAY AND LOST IN THE INTERSTICES OF THE EARTH AND A MOULD OR PLASM IS LEFT WHICH STENO CALLS AN AERIAL SHELL SEE HIS PRODOMUS PAG 84 BUT WHERE THE SPAR ABOUNDS IT PERVADES THE WHOLE SUBSTANCE FILLS UP THE CAVITY AND ASSUMES THE TRUE FORM OF THE SHELL AND SOMETIMES BY BURSTING THE PORES IS SO FAR SUBSTITUTED IN THE PLACE OF THE ORIGINAL PARTICLES THAT THE SEVERAL DIAPHRAGMS WITH THE SIPHUNCULUS OF THE ALVEOLUS ARE ACURATELY AND NICELY PRESERVED THEM48 THEM IN A MUCH MORE PERFECT STATE W THAN THE FOR MER WITH THE ALVEOLUS IN MANY OF THEM BUT THAT PART IS COMMONLY CRUSHED X BY THE INCUM BENT MATTER THE SIPHUNCULUS OF THE BELEMNITE IS ALWAYS UPON THE VERGE OF THE CHAMBER OR CELL AND IN THE SIP HUNCULUS IS A LITTLE GUTT OR DUCTUS PROCEEDING FROM THE BODY OF THE ANIMAL BY DILATING OR CONTRACTING OF WHICH THE ANIMAL IT SHOULD SEEM MAY GO OUT OR INTO ITS CELL AT PLEASURE THIS IS THE ONLY STAY WHICH THE ANIMAL HAS TO SECURE ITS RETREAT BUT I CANNOT AGREE WITH THE LEARNED DOCTOR HOOKE Z THAT THE GUT OR DUCTUS PASSES THROUGH ALL THE CELLS TO THE END OF THE SPIRAL CONE EITHER IN THIS SHELL OR THE NAUTILUS HIS DISCOVERING OF A SPIRAMENTUM IN THE CENTER OF THE LATTER WAS MERELY CONJECTURAL FOR THE ENDS OF THE SPIRAL CONE OF CONCAMERATED SHELLS A ARE SHUT UP IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THOSE OF THE TURBINATED KIND AND IT IS COMMON FOR ALL TURBINATED SHELLFISH AS THEY INCREASE IN BULK AND ENLARGE THEIR SHELLS TO LEAVE THEIR BOTTOM OR FIRSTFORMED CONVOLUTIONS THEREFORE I MAKE NO DOUBT BUT THE SAME IS DONE BY THE CONCAMERATED TRIBE FOR IF THE GUT GO THROUGH ONLY ONE OR TWO VALVES IT WILL BE A SUFFICIENT STAY TO THE ANIMAL AND BEING CONTRACTED OR DILATED WILL SERVE ALL THE PURPOSES ABOVE MENTIONED HOW FAR THIS IS PRACTICABLE BY OUR LITTLE INHABITANT CANNOT ABSO LUTELY BE DETERMINED BUT IF IT BE CONSTANTLY FIXED BY THE GUT TO THE SIPHUNCULUS IT HAS A SURPRISING POWER OF CONTRACTING AND DILATING ITS BODY TO EX TEND SO FAR AS THE BOTTOM OR POINT OF THE BELEMNITE W FIG 2 X IBID AT Y Z HOOKES POSTHUMOUS WORKS PUBLISHED BY DERHAM 8 P 306 A SEE THE LITTLE PEARLY CORNUAMMONIS SHELL WHICH49 WHICH IN SOME IS MORE THAN THIRTY TIMES THE LENGTH OF THE CELL INTO WHICH IT RETURNS B I AM APT TO THINK THAT THIS GUT OR DUCTUS AS WELL AS THE BODY OF THE CREATURE IS CAPABLE OF BEING EXTENDED VERY CONSIDERABLY TO SERVE ALL THE USES OF FORMING THE BE LEMNITE WITHOUT LEAVING THE SIPHUNCULUS AND THAT THE GUT SERVES FOR THE SAME PURPOSES WITH THE TENDONS OF THE OYSTER THE LATTER TO OPEN AND SHUT THE SHELL THE FORMER TO ALLOW THE ANIMAL TO GO OUT AND IN AT PLEASURE AND AS THE OISTER FEEDS ALTOGETHER IN THE SHELL BY OPENING THE VERGE THE BELEMNITE WHOSE RESIDENCE IS IN THE GREAT DEEP WHICH IS SELDOM DIS TURBED VERY LIKELY GOES OUT IN QUEST OF FOOD BUT TRAVELS ONLY UPON THE GUARD OR RAMPART LEAVING A TRAIL BEHIND AS ALL LAND SNAILS DO WHICH HARDENING INTO A TESTACEOUS SUBSTANCE INCREASES THE DIMENSIONS OF THE OUTER WALLS BOTH IN LENGTH AND THICKNESS FROM THE CELL OR CHAMBER TO THE BOTTOM OR POINT OF THE WHOLE BELEMNITE THE ANIMAL IN ITS PROGRESS AND RETURN CLASPS THE WHOLE GUARD AS A SNAIL DOES A SMALL BRANCH OF A TREE IN THE GARDENS AND WHERE THE TWO SIDES MEET THERE THE SULCUS IS FORMED AS IS EVIDENT FROM THE LAMINAE IN FIG 9 THE BELEMNITES LIKE ALL OTHER TESTACEOUS BODIES HAVE THE VERMICULAR TRIBE ATTACHED TO THEM AND ARE PER FORATED BY THE PHOLADES OTHER MARINE BODIES ALSO AFFIX THEMSELVES TO THE BELEMNITES OISTERS IN PARTICULAR BUT THIS NEVER HAPPENS WHILST THE ANIMAL INHABITS THE SHELL BECAUSE THE NEW ADDITIONAL LAMINAE WOULD SO COVER THE AFFIXED BODY AND ALSO THE CELLS OF THE PHO LADES AND VERMICULI THAT THEY COULD HAVE NO COM MUNICATION WITH THE WATER AND MUST CONSEQUENTLY B FIG 8 V O L LIV H PERISH50 PERISH THESE BODIES THUS ATTACHED ARE THE STRONGEST PROOF WE CAN DESIRE THAT THE BELEMNITE IS OF MARINE PRODUCTION INDEED IT MAY BE OBJECTED THAT THE BONES OF QUADRUPEDS WOOD AND STONE HAVE THESE BODIES AD HERING TO THEM AND THEREFORE MAY BE SAID TO BE MA RINE AS WELL AS THE BELEMNITE BUT WHEN WE BRING THEM TO CHEMICAL TRYAL THE OBJECTION VANISHES FOR THE BONES EITHER COME OUT OF THE FURNACE WITH A BLACK CORE OR THEY ARE REDUCED TO ASHES WHEREAS THE BE LEMNITE IS CHANGED INTO A FINE CALX AFTER THE MAN NER OF ALL TESTACEOUS BODIES AND IS CONVERTED INTO A SPECIES OF PHOSPHORUS C THE OISTERS HAVING NO LOCOMOTION FREQUENTLY AFFIX THEMSELVES TO OTHER BO DIES THAT THEY MAY BE BETTER ABLE TO STEM THE TIDES AND CURRENTS WHICH MIGHT OTHERWISE CARRY THEM FROM THEIR PROPER BEDS AND PLACES OF FEEDING THIS ATTACHMENT TO OTHER BODIES NO WAY INCOMMODES THEM BECAUSE THEY INCREASE THE DIMENSIONS OF THEIR SHELLS BY ADDING FRESH LAMINAE INWARDLY THE FIRST FORMED LA MINAE BEING AS IT WERE EXCLUDED LIE IN THE MANNER OF TILES UPON THE ROOF OF A HOUSE AND EXHIBIT THE SEVERAL STEPS OR STAGES OF THEIR GROWTH I BELIEVE A BELEMNITE IS VERY RARELY FOUND PERFECT IN THE FOSSIL STATE THOSE IN GRAVELBEDS D HAVE SUFFERED VERY MUCH BY BEING RUBBED AGAINST STONES C BY THE FLUCTUATING WATERS THOSE WHICH WE FIND IN RUBBLE AT GARSINGTONPITTS E HAVE MANY ADVENTITIOUS BODIES ADHERING TO THEM AND CONSEQUENTLY WERE DESERTED BY C THE BELEMNITE ASTER CALCINATION HAS ALL THE PROPERTIES OF THE BOLOGNIAN STONE IF IT BE EXPOSED A FEW MINUTES TO THE SUN AND IMMED ATELY TAKEN INTO A DARK ROOM IT WILL SHINE LIKE PHOS PHORUS FOR SOME TIME AND WHEN THE LIGHT DIMINISHES IF AGAIN EXPOSED TO THE SUN ITS SPLENDOR WILL BE RENEWED D FIG

A MORE CYLINDRICAL FORM I SOME OF WHICH HAVE THE PEARLY SUBSTANCE STILL REMAIN ING AN INCONTESTABLE PROOF OF THEIR BEING MARINE PRODUCTIONS HOW MUCH OF THE CAVITY IS OCCUPIED BY THE ALVEO LUS CANNOT BE TRULY ASCERTAINED UNTIL A PERFECT ONE CAN BE FOUND WHICH IT WILL BE HARD TO DO IN THE FOSSILSTATE BUT IF WE MAY JUDGE FROM THE NAUTILUS THE WALLS ARE CARRIED TO A DISTANCE FROM THE LAST FORMED VALVE MUCH GREATER THAN THAT AT WHICH THE VALVES ARE PLACED FROM EACH OTHER AS IN FIG XIII FROM A TO B WHICH GIVES THE ANIMAL ALL THE CONVENIENCE OF FORMING A NEW VALVE OR DIAPHRAGM C THIS CIRCUM

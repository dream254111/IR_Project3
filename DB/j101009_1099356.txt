j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099356,Metropolitan Life Insurance Co v Rutherford Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond March 15 1900,i245870,842 VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER April tration suit for winding up a decedents estate where he is a debtor of the estate on a purely legal claim seems to be equally clear The last point of interest in the principal case involves the equitable doctrine of  fraud presumaed from the relations of the parties the specific principle ap plied being that where one person occupies toward another a confidential rela tion and by means of that relation obtains an advantage at the expense of the other there is a presumption more or less strong according to the circumstances of the parties that such benefit was obtained by undue influence which presump tion it is incumbent on the person so benefited to remove And in such cases where the other party by reason of extreme youth or old age or mental infirmity or of the peculiar situation rendering it possible for the beneficiary to exercise an un due influence the absence of independent advice is a potent factor in establishing the actual or constructive fraud The leading case on this subject is Huguenin v Baseley 14 Ves 273 which has been followed by numerous cases in Virginia among them Statham v Ferguson 25 Gratt 38 Davis v Strange 86 Va 793 and Todd v Sykes 33 S E 517 The first two of these cases afford striking illustra tions of the application of the principle See Bisphams Equity secs 231 et seq The principal case enforces this doctrine with manifest proprietyapplying it to a case where the confidential agent of an old woman eighty years of age to whom he is largely indebted produces after her death a release to him of such indebtedness4 executed by her shortly before her deaththe amount released con stituting something like onehalf of her estate METROPOLITAN LIFE INSURANCE CO   RUTHERFORD Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond March 15 1900 Absent Riely and lHarrison JJ 1 INSURANCE

Being warranties they are in the nature of condi tions precedent and like them must be strictly complied with Error to a judgment of the Law and Equity Court of the city of Rich mond rendered April 28 1899 in an action of debt wherein the defendant in error was the plaintiff and the plaintiff in error was the defendant Reversed The opinion states the case J Rand Wellford and Leake  Carter for the plaintiff in error R W Ivey J Samuel Parrish and P A L Smith for the le fendant in error BUCHANAN J delivered the opinion of the court This is the second time this case has been before this court Upon the former writ of error the judgment was reversed and the cause re manded with leave to the plaintiff to amend her declaration The declaration was amended and another trial had in which a verdict and judgment were rendered against the defendant To that judgment this writ of error was awarded Several errors are assigned among them that the trial court ought to have rendered judgment in favor of the defendant instead of the plaintiff on the demurrer to the evidence If this be true it will be unnecessary to consider the other assignments of error Upon the trial the plaintiff offered in evidence the two policies of insurance sued on the applications therefor proofs of the death of the insured and certain oral evidence The defendant without introducing any testimony demurred to the plaintiffs evidence By the terms of the policies of insurance which are substantially alike the answers and statements contained in the printed and written appication for them were all made warranties and parts of the con tracts of insurance One of the conditions the fourth of each policy which is expressly made a part of the contract provides among other things that if any of the statements or warranties referred to in the policy or upon which it was granted was not true that the policy should be void Among the questions required to be answered in each application was whether the parents of the insured were living or dead 843VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER and if dead the cause of death In reply to that question the in sured stated that his father was dead and that the cause of his death was cholera morbus It was further provided by each contract of insurance condition sixth that proofs of death under it should be made upon blanks to be furnished by the company and that the proofs should contain answers to each and every question propounded in the blanks to the claimant and other persons that the contents of such proofs of death should be evidence of the facts stated therein in behalf of but not against the insurance company and that no suit condition seventh should be brought against the company under the policy until ten days should have elapsed after filing in the home office proofs of death upon all the forms furnished by the company In the blanks furnished for proofs of death the plaintiff the beneficiary in the policies was asked to state the cause of the death of the father of the insured and she answered Fistula This answer it is insisted shows that the statement of the insured in his application for insurance that his father died of cholera morbus was untrue and that there was therefore a breach of the warranty which rendered the policies void and prevented any recovery by the plaintiff By the express terms of the contracts of insurance those proofs were declared to be evidence in favor of the company but not against it But independent of any agreement to that effect the preliminary proofs presented to an insurance company in compliance with the con dition of its policy of insurance are admissible as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein in favor of the company They were in tendled for the action of the company and upon their truth it had the right to rely and unless corrected for mistake the plaintiff was bound by them Good faith required that she should be held to answers and statements made in the proofs of loss until it was shown that she was under a misapprehension of the facts or ignorant of material matters subsequently ascertained Izsurance Co v Newton 22 Wall 32 4 Joyce on Ins sec 3766 If the plaintiff had not introduced the proofs of loss the defendant could have done so but the plaintiff introduced them The record does not state for what purpose they were introduced but they seem to have been offered as evidence generally and not merely for the purpose of showing that the company had knowledge of the death of the in sured and that proofs of death had been furnished as required by the conditions of the policy as tlhe plaintiff insists If their introduction April 8441900 METROPOLITAN LIFE INS CO V RUTHERFORD could have been limited to that particular purpose as to which we ex press no opinion no effort was made by her to so limit them Having been introduced in evidence generally and like the other testimony they must be considered in all their parts and effect must be given to all they prove or tend to prove In the case of Insurance Co v Newton supra it was held that the preliminary proofs presented to an insurance company in compliance with the condition of its policy of insurance are admissible as prima face evidence of the facts stated therein against the insured and on behalf of the company In The North American Fire Ins Co v Zaunger 63 Ill 464 a suit to recover for a loss under a policy of insurance the plaintiff in troduced in evidence generally his own affidavit of the loss made to the company which showed that the house had become vacant some three weeks before the loss There was no attempt made to limit the effect of the evidence to the fact that preliminary proofs had been made and it was held that the evidence must be considered for all the purposes of the case though its effect was to defeat the plaintiffs recovery In the case of Helwig v Mutual Life Ins Co 132 N Y 331 the policy sued on provided that the answers of the insured to the com panys medical examiner were warranted to be true In answer to the question  When last attended by a physician and cause the reply was Six yearsi measles Upon the trial for the purpose of prov ing the death of the insured the plaintiff produced in evidence a veri fied certificate made about four months after the application in which the attending physician stated that he had been the medical attendant or adviser of the decedent for astralgia about one and ahalf years ago That certificate introduced in evidence by the plaintiff it was lield could be relied on by the insurance company as evidence to show the falsity of the answer made by the insured to the medical examiner In the case under consideration the proofs of loss show that the death of the father of the insured was caused by a disease other than that stated in the application for insurance thus showing prima facie the falsity of one of the answers of the insured which he had warranted to be true No effort was made to show that this statement in the proof of loss was the resultof a mistake or was not true although the plaintiff herself the party who made the statement testified in the case In this condition of the record the falsity of the answer of the insured as to the cause of his fathers death must be treated as estab lished It may be as the beneficiary insists that this answer was not 845VIRGINIA LAW REGISTER really material to the risk assumed by the company but that does not affect the question Where the answers to questions propounded in an application for in surance are made warranties by the terms of the contract of insurance its validity depends upon the literal truth of such answers and it is a matter of no consequence whether they are material to the risk or not Being warranties they are in the nature of conditions precedent and like them must be strictly complied with Lynchburg Fire Ins Co v West 76 Va 575 Va Fire  Marine Ins Co v Morgan 90 Va 290 Home Ins Co v Sibert 96 Va 403 The warranty being un true the plaintiff cannot recover We are of opinion therefore that the defendants demurrer to the evidence ought to have been sustained and judgment given for it The judgment of the trial court must be reversed and set aside and this court will enter such judgment as it ought to have entered Reversed NOTEThe decision in this case seems to bear hard upon the beneficiary under the policy and yet under the technical rules of law it was doubtles cor rect The rule of law that a breach of warranty avoids the policy howsoever im material the breachoften made also a part of the contract as in the principal caseis extremely severe in its operation and for that reason has been abolished and prohibited in many of the States We understand that some legislation of this kind was had at the last session of the Virginia legislature See synopsis of legislation post where specific reference will be made to such statute if a copy can be had before this number goes to press The plaintiff seems to have unwittingly fallen into a legal pitfall The war ranty in the application was that the father of the insured had died with cholera morbus In the proofs of loss furnished by the beneficiaryin which by the terms of the policy were to be answered all questions propounded in the blanks furnished for that purpose by the companythe cause of the death of the in sureds father was stated to be fistula As far as can be gathered from the opinion there was no explanation of this discrepancy It was a palpable admission by the plaintifl against her own interest that the statement in the application was false On the demurrer to evidence this admission of a breach of a warranty uncon tradicted seems to have left the court no alternative but that which it adopted to find that there was a breach of warranty and that the policy was thereby avoided The court seems to intimate though we are glad to observe that it does not commit itself to the proposition that an insurance company may by contract with the insured lawfully stipulate as to what shall be evidence and what shall not We should be sorry to see any principle established in this State by which parties will be permitted by contract in advance of any controversy thus to alter the established rules of evidence If this were permitted an insurance company by 846 AprilVASHON V VASHON inserting a provision in its policy that this policy shall be the sole evidence in troduced against the company in case of litigation or  no parol evidence shall be admissible against the company might practically exclude all material testi mony in behalf of the insured True such a company would in the end lose business but much harm would be done before the effect of such a clause were brought home to the public Fire insurance companies have for a long time en deavored but without success to exclude estoppels and proof of a broader author ity in their agents than is specifically bestowed in their written commissions by inserting in the policies a provision that the agent shall be regarded as the agent of the insured or to have no authority to waive any of the provisions of the policy  unless authorized to do so in writing or unless the waiver is  en dorsed in writing on the policy Such clauses the courts have practically dis regarded As said in Richards on Insurance p 90  Courts do not look with much favor on attempts by the parties to abrogate by agreement the established rules of evidence VASHONS EXECUTRIX V VASHON AND OTHERS Supreme Court of Appeals At Richmond March 15 1900 1 REMAINDERSVesting of estates If the language of the instrument creating an estate leaves it doubtful whether the purpose was to create a vested or con tingent estate the courts will hold it to be vested and this is all that is meant

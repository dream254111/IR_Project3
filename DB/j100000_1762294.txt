the University of Rochester the academy has lost one of its most active members  a loss which will be felt for a long time to come The publications of the academy have been pushed forward most energetically and the active editor Professor Martin has succeeded in bringing them up to date their value being thus greatly enhanced Mr George F Kunz sent in an interesting paper on recent mineralogical discoveries and several members reported on the results of journeys undertaken during last summers vaca tion Dr H Carrington Bolton made some interesting remarks on German and Austrian libraries which he had visited in pursuance of bibliographical studies and dwelt on the defects of the systems of several of these libraries On the other hand he described the management of the library of Strassburg as worthy of the highest commendation The arrangement is thoroughly systematical Visitors are allowed the greatest possible facilities and any citizen of Alsace Lorraine applying for books is entitled to have them sent to his house whether he lives in Strassburg or in some other part of the province Dr Brinton gave a brief description of his studies in English collections and libraries and noted a large collection from Bolivia which is said to contain an unexpectedly large number of species and genera unknown to science After a brief discussion of the trap rocks of Pennsylvania and New York Dr F Boas gave a sketch of the ethnological results of his journey to British Colum bia during which he visited most of the peoples of that province The committee on publications and lectures of the Massachu setts Society for promoting Good Citizenship have issued a circu lar requesting the clergymen of Massachusetts to prepare and preach and as far as possible publish between now and the gen eral election in November at least one sermon on the duties and responsibilities of American citizenship A study undertaken by W von Bezold a number of years ago made it probable that thunderstorms have a period corresponding to that of the rotation of the sun In his inquiry he had used the material collected at the meteorological stations of Bavaria As however an influence of this kind seemed very improbable he did not publish the results of his researches Recently Hertz Wiede mann Arrhenius and others have shown that by the influence of radiation the conductivity of the air is changed and thus a period of the frequency of thunderstorms corresponding to that of the rotation of the sun does not appear improbable For this reason Von Bezold has taken up his earlier researches and carefully I67 scrutinized the observations of thunderstorms in Bavaria and Wurtemberg from I88o to I887 The Naturwissenschaftliche Rundschau reports on a paper on this subject read by Von Bezold before the Berlin Academy of Science He finds that a period exists and the proofs he gives are so convincing that he feels encouraged to pursue this subject more fully LETTERS TO THE EDITOR Floods in the Lower Mississippi MAJOR POWELL in his letter to the New Orleans Chamber of Commerce suggests as a means of regulating the lower Mississippi the erection of large basins at the head waters of its tributaries in the Rocky Mountains  The cuttingpower of a stream he says increases rapidly with an increase of sedimentary load If this be correct then there must be an increase in either quan tity or in velocity by the increasing sedimentary load those two constituting the working energy of the water which is quantity times half the square of the velocity As to the quantity there is in fact an increase Draw a cubic foot of water from the river and let it rest The sediment will settle to the bottom and is therefore heavier than the amount of water it displaces as other wise it would remain in suspension For this reason a cubic foot of water mixed with sediment is heavier than a cubic foot of clear water But how is it that this same sediment was in suspension in the same water when it was in the river  Because the water there had velocity Velocity has an equivalent in head or water weight    and just as much of this head will be used to carry along the sur plus weight of the sediment as is equivalent to this surplus Dimin ished head is diminished velocity Clear water therefore will flow quicker that is have more working energy than water mixed with sediment which will readily be seen when we imagine such an amount of sediment to be added to the water that it would attain the consistency of sirup If now as Major Powell claims the product of the two is in creased by the increase of sediment then the gain in weight of the quantity ought to be greater than the loss in velocity This is not likely for the reason that the velocity in that product is squared and every loss in it therefore is squared too It is furthermore not likely because every gain in weight creates an additional loss in head part of the latter being used to crush and pulverize the in crease of sediment from heavy bowlders in the mountains into fine sand at the mouth of the river There is only one grand total of power corresponding to a certain head and every deduction from it is a loss which cannot be made up for again The indisputable fact that rivers choked by sediment do more lateral cutting than cleaned rivers therefore does not seem to be exactly expressed by attributing this fact to an increase in cutting power of the water through sediment If it is Major Powell should prove it Again the letter reads The waters of the Missouri come loaded with materials which go on cutting and grinding with con stantly increasing energy in their journey to the sea choking the channel and cutting away the land I should like to see this sen tence more fully explained as I fail to understand its full meaning As a matter of fact there are other causes besides the action of sediment which increase the amount of riversediment by bank OCTOBER 5 i888I68 SCIENCE cutting but the crumbling of banks to a large extent is caused by the dissolvingpower of water Loam clay and silt as a rule largely constitute the banks of rivers Water coming into contact with loam at a point e will destroy its cohesion and carry it away The water falling from level e d to a b eats into the bank as far as f and the whole body f eg deprived of its support will tumble down into the river as soon as it is sufficiently heavy to overcome the cohesion along gf this irrespective of any sedi ment being mixed with the water as pure water will destroy the cohesion of those materials in exactly the same way as water loaded with sediment The same effect is produced by frost If bankmaterial saturated with water freezes up its cohesion is destroyed The spring freshets will carry it away Another instance of this kind is a bank consisting of layers rest ing on an inclined clay seam When for some reason the seam becomes exposed to water this will moisten its surface and trans form it into a slippery mass thus causing the overlying strata to slide into the river Therefore suppose the head waters of all the tributaries of the Mississippi to furnish an entirely clear supply of water It enters the riverchannel Immediately it picks up such sediment as its velocity enables it to carry More sediment is added by the causes presented the old condition  There are other remedies of longestablished repute which if not by the same constructions in principle certainly will be just as practical here as anywhere else  The prime end to be sought so Major Powell correctly puts it  in order to prevent destructive floods is to prevent the chok ing of the channel  and again  The real problem is to relieve the river of its excess of sediment In these views engineers will fully concur The letter touches upon one of these remedies Much of a coarser sediment is left to add to the geological growth of the region while vast quantities pass on to the sea The end to be sought then is to reverse this condition and make the vast quantities add to the geological growth of the region This can be accomplished by fixing protecting and in that way solidifying large deposits which are now in constant migration and preventing their being transformed again into floating sediment To this end force the river into a channel which removes the de posits from the current The sediment contributed by the tributaries now is only a trifle as compared with the amount centuries have accumulated in the beds of the Missouri and Mississippi To make these enormous quantities terra firma is more effective than to clean the mountain waters because the effect will be felt right there where the work is done and at once Another means of making the sediment add to the geological growth of the region is this Create a strip of  dead water on both banks all along the entire extent of the rivers in open and direct connection with the current There will be a constant exchange of water between the current where the water is loaded with sedi ment and these bodies of standing water and whatever water from the current gets into this strip will deposit its sediment Then it returns into the river is reloaded with detritus and re enters the strip of standing water Thus a destructive agency will be turned into a useful tool carrying along sediment to add to the geological growth of the region In course of time this strip will be completely filled and then the water will not only flow in a con centrated channel but there will also have been formed a terrace at the foot of the old bank which protects it This is the really ef fective settlingbasin and the thousands of miles of riverbanks are the places where they must be constructed because they do the work right on the spot where it is needed JULIUS MEYER CE Cleveland O Sept r8 Chalchiuitl A Note on the Jadeite Discussion THE jadeite discussion is evidently not yet terminated In the American Anlhrofiologist for July i888 Dr A B Meyer of Dres den maintains his position  that the nephrite jadeite question is not an ethnologic problem the mineral occurring wherever the artefacts from it are found while at the recent meeting of the VOL XII No 296 American Association for the Advancement of Science August i888 Prof F W Putnam of Cambridge reiterated his belief al ready expressed in the reports of the Peabody Museum that the specimens of jadeite from Mexico and Central America were origi nally brought from Asia Jade first became known to modern Europeans by the specimens brought from Mexico as the origin of the name attests Spanish 5ziedra de ijada so called from its supposed virtues in colic mat de ijada and therefore the references to it in the early writers on Mexico merit special attention These have been partly collated by E G Squier in his  Observations on a Collection of Chalchi huitls Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History New York I869 and later by Professor Fischer in his wellknown volume  Nephrit und Jadeit In verifying these quotations I find that some important authorities have been altogether omitted and oth ers only partially reported No direct reference is made to the Codex Mendoza and Squier omits some of the most important observations of Sahagun to wit those referring to the provenance of these minerals  the very point which in the present stage of the question we wish light upon The practical bearing of this point will be readily appreciated when I add that the statement was made at the meeting of the American Association in August that last winter an expert was sent to Mexico at considerable expense for the sole purpose of discovering the locality of the jadeite but his search was vain The Nahuatl Mexican name for jadeite is chalchiuitl This appears to have been applied to any greenish partially transparent stone capable of receiving a handsome polish All such were highly esteemed Specific distinctions were established between such precious minerals by descriptive adjectives as follows Iztac chalchiuzitl white chalchiuitl of a fine green quite trans parent without stripes or stains Quetzal chalchuitll precious chalchiuitl white much transpar ency with a slight greenish tinge somewhat like a jasper Tlilayotic literally  of a blackish watery color  with mingled shades of green and black partially transparent chlormelanite  Toltecaiztlz literally  Toltec knife or  Toltec obsidian  of a clear translucent green and very beautiful These are the descriptions of Bernardino de Sahagun Historia de la Nueva Es5ania Lib XI cap 8 probably the source of all other writers upon this subject He is not very exact as to the localities in which they were found by the natives The firstmen tioned however the white chalchiuitl he states was obtained from quarries in the vicinity of Tecalco This town which I do not find on late maps was in the state of Puebla and it may be the modern Tecali mentioned by Orozco y Berra in that state Geografia de las Lenguas Indzjenas de Mejico p 21  It would be worth while searching in that vicinity With reference to the lastmentioned variety the Toltec stone Sahagun makes a noteworthy remark not quoted by Squier which so far as it goes is certainly in favor of the view that this valued variety was not from any deposit known to the natives This beau tiful species of chalchiuitl he says did at one time exist in this country New Spain and does yet as is proved by the pizeces ob tainedfrom the ancient edifices In other words no deposit was known to the natives of his day and such fragments as they pos sessed were exhumed from the ruins of the ancient cities The Codex Mendoza is a copy of the tributeroll of the ancient Mexican Empire published in LORD KINGSBOROUGHS Mexican Antiquities It defines the tax from each district naming the cities Strings of chalchiuitl are mentioned as part of the tribute from a number of localities and refer evidently to small rounded pieces used as beads and obtained from the sands of streams Only from one district are large pieces of chalchiuitl demanded These three in number each year were required from Tototepec Chinantlan and other towns situate in the present state of Oaxaca and principally in the department of Vilalta Zoochila Miihlen pfordt describes this region as mountainous and wild inhabited by the Mixe Indians and the Chinantecas Schilderun der Re6yublik Mejico Bd II s  213 214 This is the spot to which the explorer should penetrate if he would discover the locality of the large pieces of Mexican jadeite D G BRINTON Media Penn Sept 28

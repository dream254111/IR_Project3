Benton E J International Law and Diplomacy of the SpanishAmerican War Pp 300 Price I50 Baltimore Johns Hopkins Press I908 This work is a history of the relations of the United States and Spain during the Cuban insurrection and the resulting SpanishAmerican war Especial emphasis is given to the controverted points of international law which were passed upon during the conflict Though the sources used do not include the Spanish material on the subject the viewpoint throughout is judicial 440Book Department Some of the authors conclusions are that the reconcentrado policy was a justifiable means of warfare that the refusal of arbitration offered by Spain in the Maine case was a mistake that McKinley did not exhaust the resources of diplomacy before turning the conduct of affairs over to Congress and that the intervention of the United States on humanitarian grounds was not good practice in international law The decisions of the courts in prize cases and allied subjects are reviewed

which cover practically every object of interest in the city In some instances how ever the pictures lack distinctness and some subjects are presented so often that the charge of padding cannot be avoided The descriptive chap ters occupying about onethird of the book are written in a style that is easy but which often offends by wordiness For the casual tourist however a handbook of this sort

The history of Spain in the nineteenth century is full of such rapid changes that any onevolume work must become to a great extent a chronicle of victories and defeats insurrections riots provincial and party feuds changes in succession and general national unrest This is no exception There are no chapters on the economic forces impelling the government or the people and no discussion of social and political tendencies in the kingdom The general political movements however are well outlined by an author who was qualified for the work as are few other English scholars The discussion of the internal affairs of the peninsula is more satisfactory than that of foreign affairs The Carlist wars the struggle for the abolition of the provincial rights the church lands controversies and the military com plications are clearly presented The treatment of colonial politics is evidently drawn from materials representing but one side of the question and in the discussion of the SpanishAmerican war the peculiar spelling given to the names of American officers shows that American sources were not well cov 441 177The Annals of the American Acadclmy ered Several inaccuracies in

delivered at Harvard in I9o7presents an attrac tive appearance Disappointing however it proves to be after careful reading Attempting to present the arguments both for and against municipal owner ship it fails to command the respect of either advocates or opponents of in creased functions for the municipality nor does it deal with the subject in a sufficiently scholarly manner to raise it above the necessity of taking sides The question turns in the opinion of the author on whether a city can operate public utilities to better advantage by directly employing its labor than can a private company Wherever an industry tends to become a monopoly the case for municipal ownership is strong where the civic authori ties are weak or corruptible or there are large numbers of men to be em ployed or if free competition exists private operation is preferable Dougherty J H The Electoral System of the United States Pp 425 Price I5o New York G P Putnams Sons Eltzbacher Paul Anarchism Translated by S T Byington Pp xxi 309 Price I50 New York Benj R Tucker I9o8 The book represents an attempt to outline the doctrines of anarchism as they have been developed by its leading exponents Threefourths of the book are devoted to quotations from these authorities The first few pages contain definitions of the terms the state the law and property The theories of the leading anarchist writers are then reviewed William Godwin based his theories on the general welfare From the standpoint of the general welfare he rejects law absolutely In the absence of law he must likewise reject the state Proudhon bases his doctrines on justice On a basis of justice practically all statutory and constitutional law is rejected Johann Kaspar Schmidt commonly known as Max Stirner founded his teach ing on the supreme law of personal welfare If each man looks to his owl welfare law is unnecessary because in order to attain the highest personal welfare it is often necessary for man to transgress the law Bakunin looks upon the evolutionary principle of the progress of man kind from a lower to a higher stage as the fundamental law In this evolu tion enacted law must of necessity disappear together with the state and 442 I78Book Department property Kropotkin looks upon the progress from a less happy to the happi est existence as the fundamental thing In the course of this progress one of the first steps will be the abandonment of enacted law of the state and of private property Tucker in his anarchistic writings considers selfinterest as the fundamental law and from this law he derives the law of equal liberty From this standpoint there is no objection to law and property but there is objection to the state Tolstoi bases his doctrines on the supreme law of love For loves sake Tolstoi rejects law as a means of developing people He likewise rejects the state and the institution of property Following this summary of the doctrines of the leading anarchist writers the author draws up several tables to illustrate the tendency of their doctrines and draws conclusions from them The book is particularly timely owing to the present outcry of the general public against anarchism and the failure of even the most learned to secure an adequate comprehension of anarchistic thought The style is scientific in the extreme heavy and unin teresting yet to the student in search of the fundamental principles under lying the science of anarchy the facts are presented in a masterftul way worthy of the highest commendation Fisher S G The Struggle for American Independence Pp xxi 1159

students of the sub jects indicated in the title Three detailed courses of ninety lectures each are outlined on the subjects of American history diplomacy and government Three shorter courses of thirty lectures each on the same subjects follow These outlines are supplemented by suggestions for class topics term reports etc and by a valuable chapter on methods and materials giving directions for the use of books and preparation of reports Though intended as a guide and aid in some specific courses in Harvard University the arrangement of the volume and the general character of the material to which reference is made make the volume of value to the general student Harwood W S The New Earth Pp xii 378 Price 175 New York Macmillan Company I907 This book is the better of two recent efforts to present to the general public the results of the recent application of science to agriculture This is a very large field as none of the industries is related to so many sciences in none of them has the dependence upon science been so late in its discovery and in none has the development of science been so rapid Mr Harwood attempts to present these recent developments in their economic aspects so that we may understand the change that is going on around us The book represents a rather wide consulting of the very numerous materials that are now pouring forth In many cases they are quoted at great length so that the book is almost as largely a selection of the works of others as it is the work of the author For the calm and unpoetic the authors efforts at popularizing and style are at times rather distasteful but it is the best book that has yet appeared on the subject and one which can be read with great profit by anyone who wishes to keep fully abreast of the great movements now going on in the greatest industry the world now possesses or ever has possessed Herbertson A J and F D The Oxford Geographies Vols I and III Pp viii 512 Price 4s Oxford Clarendon Press Dr A J Herbertson assisted by F D Herbertson of Oxford has written a series of geographies for the schools They have borrowed something from or conceived an idea similar to the prodigiously successful series of geographical readers written by Mr Frank Carpenter which sold a million copies before the last one was done Dr Herbertson has a preliminary a junior and senior geography In the first one he takes imaginary journeys up and down across and around the continents using all sorts of appro priate conveyances and pointing out to his imaginary youthful audience the things he should see It makes some of us wish we could begin geography again In the last of the series the senior geography which has recently 444 I8oBook Department appeared he has divided the world up into what he calls natural regions These he uses in contrast to the irrational method of thoroughly treating political divisions which may have no economic difference from those ad joining This is a distinct advance over the old method but it is not followed rigorously all the way through the bookcompromises being made with politi cal geography and history and through pressure of space unexplained state ment of fact is at times rather too prominent The writing of geography texts is a matter of such forced compromise that it is a question if any method can be settled upon to the satisfaction of all parties Hill F T Decisive Battles of the Law Pp viii 268 Price 225 New York Harper  Brothers I907 Reserved for later notice Hinds W A American Communities and Cooperative Colonies Pp 608 Price 150 Chicago Charles H Kerr  Co I908 This standard work which was first published in 1878 now appears in en larged form thoroughly revised and brought down to the year 1907 It includes all the wellknown experiments such as the Shaker colonies Owens communities Brook Farm and the various Fourieristic phalanxes Cabets Icaria and the Oneida Community in addition to a multitude of less known settlements to say nothing of such contemporary organizations as the Theos ophist Colony at Point Loma the Single Tax Society at Fairhope Alabama the Ruskin Commonwealths Upton Sinclairs Helicon Home Colony and the Straight Edge Probably the most surprising feature of a book like this to most readers is the disclosure of the large number of radical social ex periments that are being carried on at the present time As a follower of John Humphrey Noyes Mr Hinds naturally believes in some form of religious communism conjoined with mutual criticism after the fashion of the Oneida Community Nevertheless he is scrupulously fair to all communists and their opponents and he records with entire honesty the modest successes of the various communistic societies and their numerous discouraging failures The book contains little attempt at philosophizing It is chiefly a straightforward account of the attempts at social betterment made by communists and social radicals Such a record leaves the reader with a renewed impression of the importance of religious enthusiasm and fanaticism as motives to communistic activity It fills him with admiration for the enthusiasm the lofty motives and the unselfish endeavor that have marked the most of such attemptsadmiration not unmixed with sadness at the selfishness and selfseeking that ultimately creep in to overthrow them Yet despite failures men will undoubtedly continue to experiment with the alluring form of social organization so long as they seek a concrete ex pression of the sentiment of brotherhood All such experiments will add their bit to the worlds store of experience and wisdom and therefore they deserve permanent record Not the least valuable feature of Mr Hinds book is the bibliography at the end of each chapter 445 I8IThe Annals

United States Pp 208 Price 15o New York Columbia University Press I9o7 This volume by Dr Meyer Jacobstein is a very carefully prepared mono graph giving the development and present situation of the American tobacco industry Dr Jacobstein knows his subject and the monograph gives evidence of much careful work He deals in a dispassionate way yet clearly with the facts of the development of the tobacco trust which has of late been the subject of such heated presentation and litigation The book covers the whole field from the first plantations in the colonies to the foreign trade and the tobacco tax It is rather unfortunate that a book of such merit should appear in the clumsy form of uncut pages requiring as much time to get at the book as to read one of its clearly put chapters Johnson A S Introductory Economics Pp 338 New York School of Liberal Arts and Sciences 1907 By those economists who hold the productivity theory of distribution this book can merit naught but praise It is a clear logical presentation written in terse English The influence of his former teacher Professor Clark is apparent throughout the authors pages especially in those chapters dealing with the theories of wages and interest Like Clark he sees in monopoly an element ever interfering with the desirable free play of competition as a regulator of interest wages and profits He reechoes the customary economic formula Wages under competitive conditions are determined by the margi nal productivity of labor To that growing group of economists however who have broken from the Clark idea of marginal productivity and adhere to the price or exchange theory the book offers little of value In the main Dr Johnson has written a series of studies illustrating the operation of the two economic principles of diminishing utility and diminishing returns with some additional chapters on general economic subjects suth as money financial institutions international trade etc The volume does not claim to be a general textbook on the whole field of economics Its aim is rather to reach the lay public than the student body for the author believes that in a democratic state economic science should be for the many not for the few Kellogg V L Darwinism ToDay Pp xii 403 Price 200 New York Henry Holt  Co I907 In this volume Professor Kellogg of Leland Stanford Jr University care fully reviews the biological studies of the last fifty years to see what effect they have had in destroying or changing the fundamental conceptions of 446 I82Book Departtmentt Darwin He thus puts in brief and accessible form for the general reader all the important evidence gotten by the various students and the theories suggested thereby The volume at once becomes valuable as a source book After outlining Darwinism the attacks upon Darwins positions are taken up in detail This is followed by a defence accompanied by mention of alternative theories The final conclusion reached is that while obviously many of Darwins ideas were erroneous that Darwinism is far from dead It is probably necessary to accept Weissmanns theory that acquired characters are not inherited Natural selection remains however not the cause of changes in species but the final controlling force in evolution The opponents of natural selection have failed to displace it Darwinism does not explain variation in indifferent characters of which there are many Here is a great field for research The cause of modifications may be simpler than we think The book is valuable Unless the reader knows something of biology it will be hard reading for technical terms are constantly used Koebel W H Modern Argentina Pp xv 380 London Francis Griffiths 1907 Ladd G T In Corea with Marquis Ito Pp x 477 Price 250 New

profited somewhat from the castigation he received in the course of the American lectures It has at least led him to read Walker and Walker a quarter of a century ago said everything that is said in Mr Mallocks book only far more sanely than the worthy Englishman has done This volume however is a better piece of work than the lectures gave reason to expect The point of view of course is wholly aristocratic The world is divided into two classes laborers and men of directive ability they are born so and theres an end ont Great men produce all the changes in human af fairs Labor is the mere mechanical power of the human machine Laborers not being great possess only this mechanical power and therefore must sub mit themselves if they would be happy to the Godgiven directive ability of their betters It all reads quite like Aristotle on slavery A socialist state argues Mr Mallock could not select these men of ability and even if it could select them it could not induce them to work if it reduced their reward below its present amount Very likely and if socialism cannot overcome these difficulties it will fail And yet progressive government enterprises are becoming discouragingly common Perhaps as 447 I83The Annals of the American Academy Mr Mallock declares socialists are men incapable of comprehending accu rately the concrete facts of life and perhaps that is why they say that municipal tramways are a success in England that Russian railways pay big dividends that the Swedish telephone puts ours to shame and that New Zealand is reasonably prosperous in spite of radical land laws compulsory arbitration old age pensions and such foolishness But directive ability is the phrase that justifies present society in toto It includes the work of people no less different than John Wanamaker run ning a department store Bernard Shaw writing a play E H Harriman looting a railroad and Harry Lehr giving a monkey dinner The idle sport is a useful member of society He incites more directive ability in the captain of industry who wants to make his own son an idle sport Vive la Newport Aside from using his leading term in a variety of senses Mr Mallock con stantly assumes that the sole function of business men is to direct industry and that in general their pay is proportionate to their service We should like to commend to him Prof Veblens discussion of pecuniary and industrial employments and then ask him to investigate how far the great American fortunes are the reward of social service in directing industry The present order can be defended but not on the basis of any such equivalence between service and financial reward as Mr Mallock constantly and rather cleverly assumes It is his method of measuring the product of labor that is most edifying however It will be disquieting to radical agitators however to learn that labor is getting several times what it produces In a word Mr Mallocks analysis appears to us radically unsound He easily enough exposes the fallacies in Marxs argument that has often been done before After all is it very profitable to write many more theoretical books just now either for or against socialism Is it not more worth while to study with open mind the failures and successes not only of the present system but of the now numerous experiments in government operation of industry But doubtless the Marxian socialist will not allow it Mazzarella Joseph Les Types Sociaux et le Droit Pp xxiii 457 Price 5 fr Paris Octave Doin I908 This book is the second of twelve volumes projected dealing with the various subjects within the domain of sociology It is a study of social types from the juridical point of view and embodies the results of ten years inductive labor In a valuable introduction covering fortyfour pages there is a detailed critical examination of Posts theory as fully matured in his Materials for the Universal Science of Law With this as a point of orientation Dr Mazzarella divides his work into three parts the first devoted to the elabora tion of his theory of fundamental types the second applies the theory to the gentile type of society and the third in like manner makes practical application to the feudal type of society His purpose is to show by a com parative study the general process of development of juridical ideas and insti tutions the causes which determine them and the laws according to which they are formed 448 184Book Department The volume evidences the extreme precision with which the author has sought to deal with his subject and probably contains the most complete ex position which has yet been made in the illuminating field of juridical ethnol ogy The readers attention is so skillfully brought to center on customs and institutions that the many other factors present in society as means and devices of social control may be easily forgotten McKenzie F A The Unveiled East Pp viii 347 Price 350 New York E P Dutton  Co Recent writing on political affairs in the Far East lacks the optimism of the years following Secretary Hays note of I9ox concerning the open door The equality of opportunity which it was hoped was to be guaranteed seems to be fast disappearing in fact though the theory is insisted upon as strenu ously as ever Mr McKenzie adds another volume to those which see the greatest menace to western commercial interests in the monopolistic attitude of Japan That the book is altogether unprejudiced cannot be claimed but there are enough bold statements of fact to make the reader uneasy lest the unpleasant conclusions drawn may be justified The acts of the government of the island empire in crushing out the Korean sovereignty and in driving away foreign competition by the subsidy of favored national enterprises are outlined in detail Chapters are also de voted to the international problems raised by the oriental immigrant in America and Australia the contest for the commercial control of the Pacific and the duties of England and the United States in the Far East The last third of the book is given to an analysis of the complicated situation in China The author sees much to hope for in the movements headed by Yuan Shi Kai and his associates but the situation is too confused to allow a statement as to whether Chinas nationality can develop fast enough to save her from international extinction The attitude of the book is partly one of alarm partly one of doubt Metin A Les Traites Ouvriers Pp 268 Price 350 fr Paris A Colin I908 Mitchell W C Gold Prices and Wages under the Greenback Standard Pp 625 Price 500 Berkeley University of

naturalization laws for almost a century Statutes framed for a popula tion of four million and for a country anxious to welcome immigration from every quarter still regulated our method of naturalization This law effected a revolution in our legislation on the subject Taken in connection with the later law of March 2 I907 on citizenship and expatriation it gives us at last a system of legislation adequate to our needs Mr Van Dyne in this excellent volume brings together all the laws still in force dealing with the acquisition of citizenship by foreigners The his torical development of our present regulations is traced as are also the judicial decisions and the opinions and rulings of the executive and inter national claims commissions The book will be found to be of great value to those having jurisdiction in naturalization proceedings to lawyers who desire to advise clients who are seeking naturalization or to establish rights of citizenship and in general to every student and citizen who has an interest in solving those problems arising from the assimilation by the nation of the hundreds of thousands of aliens coming to our shores every year An appendix of one hundred

they know that we are pouring into the body of our citizenship two hundred and fifty thousand degenerates at the very lowest estimate every year who have clouded minds and a burning hatred of the society that has wronged them and that they have ballots in their hands when the nation learns of these things and many more just as bad we may hope for an end of this national disgrace This quotation from Senator Beveridges perfervid introduction gives a good idea of the tone of Mrs Van Vorsts book which is made up chiefly of conversations with children descriptions of home and working conditions and a good many sentimental asides on the natural ability of the mill hands of Alabama and Georgia There are also some pages on Maine New Hamp shire and Massachusetts It is probably still useful to stir up the people against childlabor by sending shivers down their backs but on the whole has not the time come for more sober argument and discussion of the means of doing away with 45I I87The

crippled deteriorated starved slowly to death in order that the cottonmill industry in a single state shall prosper Nothing is gained by overstatement and hysterics Mrs Van Vorst would do better to confine her self strictly to describing what she saw for her strong point is not in drawing inferences Nevertheless the vividness of her book will doubtless rouse many other people as it aroused the

The Neale Publishing Company 1908 Dr Waylands essay turns out to be a presentation of political opinions about Jefferson as well as of those which can be ascribed to him Even those writings quoted do not fail to include contradictions in thought due perhaps to the fact that Jefferson was not only a political scientist he was also a practical statesman The opinions quoted are at times too selected rather than interpretive Mr Jefferson is pictured as an expansionist but nothing is said of his earlier doubts of its constitutionality The author thinks that possibly he would have favored the acquisition of the nearer South American States It is hard to reconcile such a belief with Jeffersons ideas as to the size of our navy and with his declaration in i809 that if Cuba were acquired we should immediately erect a column on the southernmost limit of Cuba and inscribe on it a ne plus ultra as to us in that direction de P Webb M India and the Empire Pp xvi I93 Price I20 New York

author devotes three chapters to a discussion of the responsibility of the press for present conditions of commercial im morality He holds that these conditions are due largely to the failure of the press to measure up to its opportunities The book is a protest against the abuses of competitive business and while it lacks the periods of Ruskin and the thunderings of Carlyle it is nevertheless well done The remedy advanced by the author for the conditions is an increased personal honesty but he proposes no scheme for securing this honesty The viewpoint of the book is distinctly ethical set

historical writing that we have had during the last decade His analysis of the economic social and political conditions prevailing during the period between i865 and 1877 gives to the reader a clear picture of the extraordinary situation that confronted the country Although we are but a quarter of a century removed from the reconstruction era it seems very much further fromus both in thought and feeling than the earlier decades of the nineteenth century The author has interpreted the spirit of this epoch far more successfully than any other his torian who has heretofore attempted the task In his treatment of the subject the author has adhered steadfastly to the basic facts and the most important tendencies In this respect he has shown great selfcontrol inasmuch as most writers on this period give more attention to the formation and methods of the KuKlux Clan and the other devices resorted to for the purpose of intimidating the negro than to the really fundamental social and political problems 453 I89

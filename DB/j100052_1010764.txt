SUCH CONTEMPORARY ORGANIZATIONS AS THE THEOS OPHIST COLONY AT POINT LOMA THE SINGLE TAX SOCIETY AT FAIRHOPE ALABAMA THE RUSKIN COMMONWEALTHS UPTON SINCLAIRS HELICON HOME COLONY AND THE STRAIGHT EDGE PROBABLY THE MOST SURPRISING FEATURE OF A BOOK LIKE THIS TO MOST READERS IS THE DISCLOSURE OF THE LARGE NUMBER OF RADICAL SOCIAL EX PERIMENTS THAT ARE BEING CARRIED ON AT THE PRESENT TIME AS A

CONTAINS LITTLE ATTEMPT AT PHILOSOPHIZING IT IS CHIEFLY A STRAIGHTFORWARD ACCOUNT OF THE ATTEMPTS AT SOCIAL BETTERMENT MADE BY COMMUNISTS AND SOCIAL RADICALS SUCH A RECORD LEAVES THE READER WITH A RENEWED IMPRESSION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF RELIGIOUS ENTHUSIASM AND FANATICISM AS MOTIVES TO COMMUNISTIC ACTIVITY IT FILLS HIM WITH ADMIRATION FOR THE ENTHUSIASM THE LOFTY MOTIVES AND THE UNSELFISH

INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENTS AND THEN ASK HIM TO INVESTIGATE HOW FAR THE GREAT AMERICAN FORTUNES ARE THE REWARD OF SOCIAL SERVICE IN DIRECTING INDUSTRY THE PRESENT ORDER CAN BE DEFENDED BUT NOT ON THE BASIS OF ANY SUCH EQUIVALENCE BETWEEN SERVICE AND FINANCIAL REWARD AS MR MALLOCK CONSTANTLY AND RATHER CLEVERLY ASSUMES IT IS HIS METHOD OF MEASURING THE PRODUCT OF LABOR THAT IS MOST EDIFYING HOWEVER IT WILL BE DISQUIETING TO RADICAL AGITATORS HOWEVER TO LEARN THAT LABOR IS GETTING SEVERAL TIMES WHAT IT PRODUCES IN A WORD MR MALLOCKS ANALYSIS APPEARS TO US RADICALLY UNSOUND HE EASILY ENOUGH EXPOSES

DISCUSSION OF OUR PRESENT FOREIGN TRADE AND OF OUR PROSPECTIVE FOREIGN TRADE IN ITS COMPETITION WITH THAT OF FOREIGN NATIONS IT IS MUCH TO BE REGRETTED AND IN THIS DAY SCARCELY BELIEVABLE THAT SUCH A

THE NEALE PUBLISHING COMPANY 1908 DR WAYLANDS ESSAY TURNS OUT TO BE A PRESENTATION OF POLITICAL OPINIONS ABOUT JEFFERSON AS WELL AS OF THOSE WHICH CAN BE ASCRIBED TO HIM EVEN THOSE WRITINGS QUOTED DO NOT FAIL TO INCLUDE CONTRADICTIONS IN THOUGHT DUE PERHAPS TO THE FACT THAT JEFFERSON WAS NOT ONLY A POLITICAL SCIENTIST HE WAS ALSO A PRACTICAL STATESMAN THE OPINIONS QUOTED ARE AT TIMES TOO SELECTED RATHER THAN INTERPRETIVE MR JEFFERSON IS PICTURED AS AN EXPANSIONIST BUT NOTHING IS SAID OF HIS EARLIER DOUBTS OF ITS CONSTITUTIONALITY THE AUTHOR THINKS THAT POSSIBLY HE WOULD HAVE FAVORED THE ACQUISITION OF THE NEARER SOUTH AMERICAN STATES IT IS HARD TO RECONCILE SUCH A BELIEF WITH JEFFERSONS IDEAS AS TO THE SIZE OF OUR NAVY AND WITH HIS DECLARATION IN I809 THAT IF CUBA WERE ACQUIRED WE

AUTHOR DEVOTES THREE CHAPTERS TO A DISCUSSION OF THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRESS FOR PRESENT CONDITIONS OF COMMERCIAL IM MORALITY HE HOLDS THAT THESE CONDITIONS ARE DUE LARGELY TO THE FAILURE OF THE PRESS TO MEASURE UP TO ITS OPPORTUNITIES THE BOOK IS A PROTEST AGAINST THE ABUSES OF COMPETITIVE BUSINESS AND WHILE IT LACKS THE PERIODS OF RUSKIN AND THE THUNDERINGS OF CARLYLE IT IS NEVERTHELESS WELL DONE THE REMEDY ADVANCED BY THE AUTHOR FOR THE CONDITIONS IS AN INCREASED PERSONAL HONESTY BUT HE PROPOSES NO SCHEME FOR SECURING THIS HONESTY THE VIEWPOINT OF THE BOOK IS DISTINCTLY ETHICAL SET

DEEPEST IMPORT IN THE PRESENT WORK ON THE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF RECONSTRUC TION DR DUNNING HAS MORE THAN FULFILLED THE PROMISE OF HIS EARLIER WORK IT IS IN MANY RESPECTS THE BEST PIECE OF

PICTURE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY SITUATION THAT CONFRONTED THE COUNTRY ALTHOUGH WE ARE BUT A QUARTER OF A CENTURY REMOVED FROM THE RECONSTRUCTION ERA IT SEEMS VERY MUCH FURTHER FROMUS BOTH IN THOUGHT AND FEELING THAN THE EARLIER DECADES OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY THE AUTHOR HAS INTERPRETED THE SPIRIT OF THIS EPOCH FAR MORE SUCCESSFULLY THAN ANY OTHER HIS TORIAN WHO HAS HERETOFORE ATTEMPTED THE TASK IN HIS TREATMENT OF THE SUBJECT THE AUTHOR HAS ADHERED STEADFASTLY TO THE BASIC FACTS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT TENDENCIES IN THIS RESPECT HE HAS SHOWN GREAT SELFCONTROL INASMUCH AS MOST WRITERS ON THIS PERIOD GIVE MORE ATTENTION TO THE FORMATION AND METHODS OF THE KUKLUX CLAN AND THE OTHER DEVICES RESORTED TO FOR THE PURPOSE OF INTIMIDATING THE NEGRO THAN TO THE REALLY FUNDAMENTAL SOCIAL AND POLITICAL PROBLEMS 453 I89

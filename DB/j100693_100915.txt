J100693,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS 16651678,100915,AN ACCOMPT OF A NEW CATADIOPTRICAL TELESCOPE INVENTED BY MR NEWTON FELLOW OF THE R SOCIETY AND PROFESSOR OF THE MATHEMATIQUES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE,I206872,4004 AN ACCOMPT OF A NEW CATADIOPTRICAL TELESCOPE INVENTED BY MR NEWTON FELLOW OF THE RSOCIETY AND PROSESSOR OF THE MA THEMATIQUES IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CAMBRIDGE THIS EXCELLENT MATHEMATICIAN HAVING GIVEN US IN THE TRANSACTIONS OF FEBRUARY LAST AN ACCOUNT OF THE CAUSE WHICH INDUCED HIM TO THINK UPON REFLECTING TELESCOPES IN STEAD OF REFRACTING ONES HATH THEREUPON PRESENTED THE CU RIOUS WORLD WITH AN ESSAY OF WHAT MAY BE PERFORMED BY SUCH TELESCOPES BY WHICH IT IS FOUND THAT TELESCOPICAL TUBES MAY BE CONSIDERABLY SHORTNED WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THEIR MAGNIFYING EFFECT THIS NEW INSTRUMENT IS COMPOSED OF TWO METALLIN SPECU LUMS THE ONE GONCAVE INSTEAD OF AN OBJECTGLASS THE OTHER PLAIN AND ALSO OF A SMALL PLANOCONVEX EYE GLASS BY FIGURE 1 OF TAB 1 THE STRUCTURE OF IT MAY BE EASILY IMAGINED VIZ THAT THE TUBE OF THIS TELESCOPE IS OPEN AT THE END WHICH RESPECTS THE OBJECT THAT THE OTHER END IS CLOSE WHERE THE SAID CONCAVE IS LAID AND THAT NEAR THE OPEN END THERE IS A FLAT OVAL SPECULUMMADE AS SMALL AS MAY BETHE LESS TO OBSTRUCT THE ENTRANCE OF THE RAYS OF LIGHT AND INCLINED TO WARDS THE UPPER PART OF THE TUBE WHERE IS A LITTLE HOLE FUR NISHT WITH THE SAID EYEGLASS SO THAT THE RAYS COMING FROM THE OBJECT DO FIRST FALL ON THE CONCAVE PLACED AT THE BOT TOME OF THE TUBE AND ARE THENCE REFLECTED TOWARD THE O THER END OF IT WHERE THEY MEET WITH THE FLAT SPECULUM OB LIQUITY POSITED BY THE REFLECTION OF WHICH THEY ARE DIRECTED TO THE LITTLE PLANOCONVEX GLASS AND SO TO THE SPECTATORS EYE WHO LOOKING DOWNWARDS SEES THE OBJECT WHICH THE TELESCOPE IS TURNED TO TO UNDERSTAND THIS MORE DISTINCTLY AND FULLY THE READER MAY PLEASE TO LOOK UPON THE SAID FIGURE IN WHICH A B IS THE CONCAVE SPECULUM OF WHICH THE RADIUS OR SEMI DIAMETER IS 1223 OR 13 INCHES C D ANOTHER METALLINE SPECULUM WHOSE SURFACE IS FLAT AND THE CIRCUMFERENCE OVAL G D4005 G D AN IRON WIRE HOLDING A RING OF BRASS IN WHICH THE SPECULUM C D IS FIXED F A SMALL EYEGLASS FLAT ABOVE AND CONVEX BELOW OF THE TWELFTH PART OF AN INCH RADIUS IF NOT LESS FORASMUCH AS THE METAL COLLECTS THE SUNS RAYS AT 613 INCHES DISTANCE AND THE EYEGLASS AT LESS THAN 16 OF AN INCH DISTANCE FROM ITS VERTEX BESIDES THAT THE AUTHOR AS HE INFORMS US KNEW THEIR DI MENSIONS BY THE TOOLS TO WHICH THEY WERE GROUND AND PAR TICULARLY MEASURING THE DIAMETER OF THE HEMISPHERICAL CON CAVE IN WHICH THE EYEGLASS WAS WROUGHT FOUND IT THE SIXTH PART OF AN INCH G G G THE FORE PART OF THE TUBE FASTND TO A BRASSRING H I TO KEEP IT IMMOVEABLE P Q K L THE HINDPART OF THE TUBE FASTND TO ANOTHER BRASSRING P Q OAN IRON HOOK FASTND TO THE RING P Q AND FURNISHT WITH A SCREW N THEREBY TO ADVANCE OR DRAW BACK THE HIND PART OF THE TUBE AND SO BY THAT MEANS TO PUT THE SPECULA IN THEIR DUE DISTANCE M Q G I A CROOKED IRON SUSTAINING THE TUBE AND FAST NED BY THE NAIL R TO THE BALL AND SOCKET S WHEREBY THE TUBE MAY BE TURNED EVERY WAY THE CENTER OF THE FLAT SPECULUM C D MUST BE PLACED IN THE SAME POINT OF THE TUBES AXE WHERE FALLS THE PERPEN DICULAR TO THIS AXE DRAWN TO THE SAME FROM THE CENTER OF THE LITTLE EYEGLASS WHICH POINT IS HERE MARKED AT T AND TO GIVE THE READER SOME SATISFACTION TO UNDERSTAND IN WHAT DEGREE IT REPRESENTS THINGS DISTINCT AND FREE FROM CO LOURS AND TO KNOW THE APERTURE BY WHICH IT ADMITS LIGHT HE MAY COMPARE THE DISTANCES OF THE FOCUS E FROM THE VER TEXS OF THE LITTLE EYEGLASS AND THE CONCAVE SPECULUM THAT IS E F 16 OF AN INCH AND E T V 613 INCHES AND THE RATIO WILL BE FOUND AS 1 TO 38 WHEREBY IT APPEARS THAT THE OBJECTS WILL BE MAGNIFIED ABOUT 38 TIMES TO WHICH PROPORTION IS VERY CONSENTANEOUS AN OBSERVATION OF THE CROWN ON THE WEATHERCOOKABOUT 300 FEET DISTANTFOR THE SCHEME X FIG2 REPRESENTS IT BIGGER BY 212 TIMES IN DIAMETER WHEN SEEN THROUGH4006 THROUGH THIS THAN THROUGH AN ORDINARY TELESCOPE OF ABOUT 2 FOOT LONG AND SO SUPPOSING THIS ORDINARY ONE TO MAG NIFIE 13 OR 14 TIMES AS BY THE DESCRIPTION IT SHOULD THIS NEW ONE BY THE EXPERIMENT MUST MAGNIFIE NEAR AS MUCH AS HATH BEEN ASSIGNED THUS FAR AS TO THE STRUCTURE OF THIS TELESCOPE CONCERN ING THE METALLINE MATTER FIT FOR THESE REFLECTING SPECULUMS THE INVENTOR HATH ALSO CONSIDERED THE SAME AS MAY BE SEEN BY TWO OF HIS LETTERS WRITTEN TO THE PUBLISHER FROM CAM BRIDGE JAN 18 AND 29 167172 TO THIS EFFECT VIZ 1 THAT FOR A FIT METALLINE SUBSTANCE HE WOULD GIVE THIS CAUTION THAT WHILEST MEN SEEK FOR A WHITE HARD AND DU RABLE METALLIN COMPOSITION THEY RESOLVE NOT UPON SUCH AN ONE AS IS FULL OF SMALL PORES ONLY DISCOVERABLE BY A MICRO SCOPE FOR THOUGH SUCH AN ONE MAY TO APPEARANCE TAKE A GOOD POLISH YET THE EDGES OF THOSE SMALL PORES WILL WEAR AWAY FASTER IN THE POLISHING THAN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE ME TAL AND SO HOWEVER THE METAL SEEM POLITE YET IT SHALL NOT REFLECT WITH SUCH AN ACCURATE REGULARITY AS IT OUGHT TO DO THUS TINGLASS MIXT WITH ORDINARY BELLMETALL MAKES IT MORE WHITE AND APT TO REFLECT A GREATER QUANTITY OF LIGHT BUT WITHALL ITS FUMES RAISED IN THE FUSION LIKE SO MANY AERIAL BUBIES FILL THE METALL FULL OF THOSE MICROSCOPICAL PORES BUT WHITE ARSENICK BOTH BLANCHES THE METALL AND LEAVES IT SOLID WITHOUT ANY SUCH PORESESPECIALLY IF THE FUSION HATH NOT BEEN TOO VIOLENT WHAT THE STELLATE REGULUS OF MARS WHICH I HAVE SOMETIMES USED OR OTHER SUCH LIKE SUBSTANCE WILL DO DESERVES PARTICULAR EXAMINATION TO THIS HE ADDS THIS FURTHER INTIMATION THAT PUTTY OR OTHER SUCH LIKE POWDER WITH WHICH TIS POLISHED BY THE SHARP ANGLES OF ITS PARTICLES FRETTETH THE METALL IF IT BE NOT VE RY FINE AND FILLS IT FULL OF SUCH SMALL HOLES AS HE SPEAK ETH OF WHEREFORE CARE MUST BE TAKEN OF THAT BEFORE JUDGMENT BE GIVEN WHETHER THE METALL BE THROUGHOUT THE BODY OF IT POROUS OR NOT 2 HE NOT HAVING TRIED AS HE SAITH MANY PROPORTIONS OF THE ARSENICK AND METALL DOES NOT AFFIRM WHICH IS AB SOLUTELY BEST BUT THINKS THERE MAY CONVENIENTLY BE USED ANY4007 ANY QUANTITY OF ARSENICK EQUALLING IN WEIGHT BETWEEN A SIXT AND EIGHT PART OF THE COPPER A GREATER PROPORTION MAKING THE METAL BRITTLE THE WAY WHICH HE USED WAS THIS HE FIRST MELTED THE COPPER ALONE THEN PUT IN THE ARSENICK WHICH BEING MELTED HE STIRRED THEM A LITTLE TOGETHERBEWARING IN THE MEAN TIME NOT TO DRAW IN BREATH NEAR THE PERNICIOUS FUMES AFTER THIS HE PUT IN TIN AND AGAIN SO SOON AS THAT WAS MELTED WHICH WAS VERY SUDDENLY HE STIRRED THEM WELL TOGETHER AND IM MEDIATELY POWRED THEM OFF HE SAITH HE KNOWS NOT WHETHER BY LETTING THEM STAND LONGER ON THE FIRE AFTER THE TIN WAS MELTED A HIGHER DEGREE OF FUSION WOULD HAVE MADE THE METALL POROUS BUT HE THOUGHT THAT WAY HE PROCEEDED TO BE SAFEST HE ADDS THAT IN THAT METALL WHICH HE SENT TO LONDONTHERE WAS NO ARSENICK BUT A SMALL PROPORTION OF SILVER AS HE RE MEMBERSONE SHILLING IN THREE OUNCES OF METALLBUT HE THOUGHT WITHALL THAT THE SILVER DID AS MUCH HARM IN MAKING THE ME TALL SOFT AND SO LESS FIT TO BE POLISHT AS GOOD IN RENDRING IT WHITE AND LUMINOUS AT ANOTHER TIME HE MIXED ARSENICK ONE OUNCE COPPER SIX OUNCESAND TIN TWO OUNCES AND THIS AN ACQUAINTANCE OF HIS HATHAS HE INTIMATESPOLISHT BETTERTHAN HE DID THE OTHER AS TO THE OBJECTION THAT WITH THIS KIND OF PERSPECTIVES OB JECTS ARE DIFFICULTLY FOUND HE ANSWERS IN ANOTHER LETTER OF HIS TO THE PUBLISHER OF JAN 6 167172 THAT THAT IS THE INCONVENI ENCE OF ALL TUBES THAT MAGNIFIE MUCH AND THAT AFTER A LITTLE USE THE INCONVENIENCE WILL GROW LESS SEEING THAT HIMSELF COULD READILY ENOUGH FIND ANY DAY OBJECTS BY KNOWING WHICH WAY THEY WERE POSITED FROM OTHER OBJECTS THAT HE ACCIDENTALLY SAW IN IT BUT IN THE NIGHT TO FIND STARS HEACKNOWLEDGES IT TO BE MORE TROUBLESOME WHICH YET MAY IN HIS OPINION BE EASILY REMEDIED BY TWO SIGHTS AFFIXED TO THE IRON ROD BY WHICH THE TUBE IS SUSTEINED OR BY AN ORDINARY PERSPECTIVE GLASS FASTND TO THE SAME FRAME WITH THE TUBE AND DIRECTED TOWARDS THE SAME OBJECT AS DESCARTES IN HIS DIOPTRICKS HATH DESCRI BED FOR REMEDYING THE SAME INCONVENIENCE OF HIS BEST TE LESCOPES L L L L SO4008 SO FAR THE INVENTORS LETTERS TOUCHING THIS INSTRUMENT OF WHICH HAVING COMMUNICATED THE DESCRIPTION TO MONSIEUR CHRISTIAN HUGENS DE ZULICHEM WE RECEIVED FROM HIM AN ANSWER TO THIS EFFECT IN HIS LETTER OF FEBR 13 1672 STN I SEE BY THE DESCRIPTION YOU HAVE SENT ME OF MR NEWTONS ADMIRABLE TELESCOPE THAT HE HATH WELL CONSIDERED THE ADVAN TAGE WHICH A CONCAVE SPECULUM HATH ABOVE CONVEX GLASSES IN COLLECTING THE PARALLEL RAYS WHICH CERTAINLY ACCORDING TO THE CALCULATION I HAVE MADE THEREOF IS VERY GREAT HENCE IT IS THAT HE CAN GIVE A FAR GREATER APERTURE TO THAT SPECULUM THAN TO AN OBJECTGLASS OF THE SAME DISTANCE OF THE FOCUS AND CONSEQUENTLY THAT HE CAN MUCH MORE MAGNIFIE OBJECTS THIS WAY THAN BY AN ORDINARY TELESCOPE BESIDES BY IT HE A VOIDS AN INCONVENIENCE WHICH IS INSEPARABLE FROM CONVEX OBJECTGLASSES WHICH IS THE OBLIQUITY OF BOTH THEIR SURFACES WHICH VITIATETH THE REFRACTION OF THE RAYS THAT PASS TOWARDS THE SIDES OF THE GLASS AND DOES MORE HURT THAN MEN ARE AWARE OF AGAIN BY THE MEER REFLECTION OF THE METALLIN SPECULUM THERE ARE NOT SO MANY RAYS LOST AS IN GLASSES WHICH REFLECT A CONSIDERABLE QUANTITY BY EACH OF THEIR SURFACES AND BESIDES INTERCEPT MANY OF THEM BY THE OBSCURITY OF THEIR MATTER MEAN TIME THE MAIN BUSINESS WILL BE TO FIND A MATTER FOR THIS SPECULUM THAT WILL BEAR SO GOOD AND EVEN A POLISH AS GLAS SES AND A WAY OF GIVING THIS POLISH WITHOUT VITIATING THE SPHERICAL FIGURE HITHERTO I HAVE FOUND NO SPECULA THAT HAD NEAR SO GOOD A POLISH AS GLASS AND IF M NEWTON HATH NOT ALREADY FOUND A WAY TO MAKE IT BETTER THAN ORDINARILY I AP PREHEND HIS TELESCOPES WILL NOT SO WELL DISTINGUISH OBJECTS AS THOSE WITH GLASSES BUT TIS WORTH WHILE TO SEARCH FOR A REMEDY TO THIS INCONVENIENCE AND I DESPAIR NOT OF FINDING ONE I BELIEVE THAT MNEWTON HATH NOT BEEN WITHOUT CON SIDERING THE ADVANTAGE WHICH A PARABOLICAL SPECULUM WOULD HAVE ABOVE A SPHERICAL ONE IN THIS CONSTRUCTION BUT THAT HE DESPAIRS AS WELL AS I DO OF WORKING OTHER SURFACES THAN SPHERICAL ONES WITH DUE EXACTNESS THOUGH ELSE IT BE MORE EASIE TO MAKE A PARABOLICAL THAN ELLIPTICAL OR HYPERBOLIEAL ONES BY REASON OF A CERTAIN PROPRIETY OF THE PARABOLICK CONOID WHICH IS4009 IS THAT ALL THE SECTIONS PARALLEL TO THE AXIS MAKE THE SAME PA RABOLA THUS FAR M HUGENIUS HIS JUDICIOUS LETTER TO THE LATTER PART OF WHICH CONCERNING THE GRINDING PARABOLICAL CONOIDS MR NEWTON SAITH IN HIS LETTER TO THE PUBLISHER OF FEB 20 71 THAT THOUGH HE WITH HIM DESPAIRS OF PERFORMING THAT WORK BY GEOMETRICAL RULES YET HE DOUBTS NOT BUT THAT THE THING MAY IN SOME MEASURE BE ACCOMPLISHED BY MECHANICAL DE VISES TO ALL WHICH I CANNOT BUT SUBJOYN AN EXTRACT OF A LETTER RECEIVED VERY LATELY MARCH 19TH FROM THE INVENTOR OF THIS NEW TE LESCOPE FROM CAMBRIDGE VIZ IN MY LAST LETTER I GAVE YOU OCCASION TO SUSPECT THAT THE INSTRUMENT WHICH I SENT YOU IS IN SOME RESPECT OR OTHER INDISPOSED OR THAT THE METALS ARE TARNISHED AND BY YOUR LETTER OF MARCH 16 I AM FULLY CONSIRMED IN THAT OPINIONFOR WHILEST I HAD IT IT REPRESENTED THE MOON IN SOME PARTS OF IT AS DISTINCTLY AS OTHER TELESCOPES USUALLY DO WHICH MAGNIFIE AS MUCH AS THAT YET I VERY WELL KNOW THAT THAT INSTRUMENT HATH ITS IMPERFECTIONS BOTH IN THE COMPOSITION OF THE METALL AND IN ITS BEING BADLY CAST AS YOU MAY PERCEIVE BY A SCABROUS PLACE NEAR THE MIDDLE OF THE METALL OF IT ON THE POLISHED SIDE AND ALSO IN THE FIGURE OF THAT METALL NEAR THAT SCABROUS PLACE AND IN ALL THOSE RESPECTS THAT INSTRUMENT IS CAPABLE OF FURTHER IMPROVEMENT YOU SEEM TO INTIMATE THAT THE PROPORTION OF 38 TO 1 HOLDS ONLY FOR ITS MAGNIFYING OBJECTS AT SMALL DISTANCES BUT IF FOR SUCH DISTANCES SUPPOSE 500 FEET IT MAGNIFIE AT THAT RATE BY THE RULES OF OPTICKS IT MUST FOR THE GREATEST DISTANCE IMAGI NABLE MAGNIFIE MORE THAN 37 34 TO 1 WHICH IS SO CONSIDERABLE A DIMINISHING THAT IT MAY BE EVEN THEN AS 38 TO 1 HERE IS MADE ANOTHER INSTRUMENT LIKE THE FORMER WHICH DOES VERY WELL YESTERDAY I COMPARED IT WITH A FIX FOOT TELESCOPE AND FOUND IT NOT ONLY TO MAGNIFIE MORE BUT ALSO MORE DISTINCTLY AND TO DAY I FOUND THAT I COULD READ IN ONE OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS PLACED IN THE SUNS L L L L 2 LIGHT4010 LIGHT AT AN HUNDRED FOOT DISTANCE AND THAT AT AN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOOT DISTANCE I COULD DISCERN SOME OF THE WORDS WHEN I MADE THIS TRYAL ITS APERTURE DEFINED NEXT THE EYE WAS EQUIVALENT TO MORE THAN AN INCH AND A THIRD PART OF THE OBJECTMETALL THIS MAY BE OF SOME USE TO THOSE THAT SHALL ENDEAVOUR ANY THING IN REFLEXIONS FOR HEREBY THEY WILL IN SOME MEASURE BE ENABLED TO JUDGE OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR INSTRUMENTS C N B THE READER MAY EXPECT IN THE NEXT MONTH ANOTHER LETTER WHICH CAME SOMEWHAT TOO LATE TO BE HERE INSERTED

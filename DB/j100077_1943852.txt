EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT LESSONS OF THE WAR CHARLES G FENWICK Bryn Mawr College Under the happiest of conditions it is scarcely to be expected that democracy should result in a high degree of efficient govern ment For the very object of democracy is to give expression to desires and impulses which can only with difficulty be brought into harmony Whether taken in the sense of the direct govern ment of the people or in the sense of government by representa tives of the people democracy involves the reconciliation of conflicting views resulting after much discussion and delay in the adoption of a compromise more or less unsatisfactory to both sides In the formulation of its policies democracy is thus reduced to what is feasible and expedient in view of the present state of public opinion while in the administration of its laws it must depend upon the executive ability not of its ablest citizens but of those who have succeeded in winning the confidence of their constituents Moreover in spite of obvious duplication of functions it is important that government be kept decentralized in order that the individuality of local areas may be preserved where national unity is not essential On the other hand efficiency is concerned with the attainment of the objects of government by the best and most direct means 565566 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW and with the least possible cost It seeks to put into effect the wisest and most advantageous policy irrespective of the prior approval of the people In the administration of the law it is concerned with securing ability regardless of public confidence in the particular official and it has no fear of the concentration of power necessary to secure unity and directness of national action In the normal times of peace those who believe in democracy as a principle of government have no hesitation in sacrificing some degree of efficiency to secure their ideal There are definite moral advantages attached to selfgovernment which make efficient government a distinctly secondary object Law and order must indeed be maintained in the state and certain con ditions of public health and convenience secured but whether these ends shall be attained in the largest measure and with the least possible expenditure of effort and money is less important than the fact that the means taken approve themselves to the citizen body by whom the agencies of government are set up and maintained The educational value of the public discussion of measures the training in selfrestraint which comes from the necessity of adjusting conflicting views the sense of the respon sibilities of citizenship are extrinsic benefits which are regarded as more than counterbalancing the ordinary degree of misman agement and extravagance which accompany popular govern ment Under normal conditions therefore the problem of the statesman is to obtain as good government as is compatible with selfgovernment But in time of war it is clear that a wholly different principle must prevail The problem is then one of coordinating all the forces of the nation for the single object of providing a more effective fighting machine The advantages of selfgovernment must then be subordinated to the preservation of the national existence the delays incident to discussion and debate must be overcome and a unity of administration must be obtained even at the price of a temporary executive autocracy For the sake of selfpreservation it may be necessary for the state to suspend temporarily those very principles of individual liberty which the war is fought to maintain for the nation as a wholeDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 567 The purpose of the present paper is to point out the important changes which were made in the political institutions of the United States and Great Britain in order to adapt them to the needs of a national fighting machine and to examine the special difficulties which were confronted by the United States at its entrance into the war by reason of its more rigid form of con stitutional government In the demands which it made upon democratic governments the war operated as a supreme test which revealed flaws in the machinery not otherwise noticeable Many of these flaws will be found to be inseparable from democ racy as a working form of government others however will be found to be defects in the organization of the government which may be remedied without loss of its democratic character Modern war is of such a character as to give a distinct initial advantage to an autocratic government For wars have ceased to be any longer a contest merely between the armed forces of the belligerents The distinction long made by international law between combatants and noncombatants while it still holds good in theory has for all practical purposes been regarded as obsolete The recent war has made it clear that armies are powerless in the field unless backed by the entire industrial organization of the country The manufacture of arms and ammunition the building of ships the production of increased supplies of food and the distribution of the raw materials of industry according to need are all essential elements in the larger plan of campaign by which the deadlock of the battle lines is to be broken Under such circumstances it is clear that prepared ness for war consists not merely in the maintenance of a trained army but in the control over and the coordination Qf the national resources so as to permit of their immediate adjustment to the needs of the fighting forces In this respect the state socialism of Germany gave her a marked advantage over her more democratic opponents The control exercised by the government over the raw materials of industry over transportation and in some degree over credit greatly facilitated the task of transforming a nation at peace into a nation at war It put at the disposal of the government568 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW the organization and the clerical machinery which made it possible to mobilize the industrial resources of the country with out the delay and confusion experienced in countries whose industries had never been subjected to direct state control Moreover once the war had broken out the advantage of autoc racy consisted in the absence of parliamentary responsibility and in the prompt and ready obedience of a people accustomed to discipline and command The freedom of the executive in Germany from control by the Reichstag made it possible to carry through plans without the distraction incident to questions and interpellations and without the disorganization resulting from the creation of coalition cabinets and war committees Martial law could be put into effect without raising the issue of the violation of fundamental personal rights guaranteed by the constitution Restrictions could be placed upon freedom of speech and of the press and a system of rationing food and other necessaries of life could be adopted with the assurance of coopera tion on the part of the people to whom governmental regimen tation was a familiar policy It may well be questioned whether the initial advantages in point of organization possessed by the German government were not more than offset by diplo matic blunders which a government in closer touch with public opinion might have been kept from committing and also whether the advantages of disciplined obedience on the part of the people were not counterbalanced by the lesser degree of resourcefulness and endurance resulting from the paternalistic policies of the government But it would seem that at least in respect to the prompt and effective mobilization of men and of material resources the more autocratic government of Germany had a distinct advantage over its opponents The difficulties confronting Great Britain and the United States upon their entrance into the war were due in part to the character of their governmental organization and in part to the individ ualistic traditions of their peoples Both countries were obliged to enlarge greatly the executive powers of the government to assume an unaccustomed control over the industrial life of the country to create an enormous administrative staff and toDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 569 impose restrictions upon the free activities of the citizen body In addition both countries were faced with the problem of creating and equipping new armies for which no provision had been made in advance As between Great Britain and the United States the advantage lay with the former in respect to the facility with which its form of government could divest itself of its democratic character and create the unity of control essential to efficiency The United States found itself with a government whose powers were divided between the national government and the forty eight governments of the separate states while in the national government itself a form of organization prevailed which divided responsibility between the legislative and executive branches of the government On the other hand the United States had the advantage of observing while a neutral the experience of Great Britain in meeting the emergencies created by the war and was thus enabled to act with far greater promptness and efficiency when its own turn came to mobilize its men and resources for the conflict The chief political problem before the British government during the course of the war was to secure the fullest measure of unity of control in the formulation of policies and in their effective execution and at the same time to maintain the confi dence of Parliament and indirectly of the people The advantage of the British system of cabinet government as against the checks and balances of theAmerican system was manifest from the outset So long as the confidence of Parliament could be main tained the cabinet was able to run the government with a free hand restricted neither by the jealousy of Parliament nor by the constitutional limitations peculiar to the United States The control of Parliament remained in abeyance but nevertheless ready to be exercised should a general feeling arise that the cabinet was deficient in its task At the same time the authority of the cabinet at London extended to all parts of the kingdom alike and no question could be raised as to the possible encroach ment of its decrees upon the powers of local selfgovernment in the different sections of the country No constitutional diffi culties were encountered in the way of the assumption of unlimited powers on the part of the government570 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW The outbreak of the war found the Liberal party supported by the Irish Nationalist and Labor parties in possession of a majority in Parliament A truce was entered into with the Unionists which resulted in the suspension of parliamentary interpellation and enabled the government to put through a number of emergency acts without delay In June 1915 a coalition cabinet was formed under threat from the Unionist party that it could no longer refrain from criticizing the war program of the government unless it were represented in the cabinet In turn dissatisfaction was expressed with the coalition cabinet and the demand was raised for the creation of a smaller body which could be released from responsibility for the conduct of the departments and devote its entire attention to the problems of the war A war committee of six members was then formed within the coalition cabinet and with the assistance of a military naval and diplomatic staff it undertook a general direction of war measures subject to a limited control on the part of the cabinet as a whole Thus organized the coalition cabinet suc ceeded in maintaining the confidence of Parliament during the critical period accompanying the introduction of conscription Criticism of the inefficiency of the war committee led however to a further reorganization of the government and in the presence of a proposal that a council of war be formed from which the prime minister was to be excluded Mr Asquith resigned and a new War Cabinet under the leadership of Mr Lloyd George succeeded to the control of the government The war cabinet was a constitutional innovation of a striking character It was not the result of a parliamentary vote but of an agreement among the leaders of the different parties Unlike the war committee it became directly responsible to Parliament but it did not undertake the task of party leadership in the house of commons and its members attended the sessions of Parliament only on special occasions Its relations with the larger body of ministers were somewhat uncertain It ceased to exercise any active direction bf the administration and merely undertook to supervise in a general way the functions of the departments and to adjust conflicts of authority among theDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 571 old and new ministerial offices In consequence of the com plete elimination of the old Liberal leaders in the choice of the war cabinet and of the important ministerial posts a Liberal opposition was formed in the house of commons and Mr Asquith still holding the support of many of his former followers several times came to the rescue of the group which had ousted him from the government Public opinion as manifested in the press welcomed the new cabinet as giving promise of a more energetic and efficient prose cution of the war and looked upon the departure from constitutional precedent as fully justified by the needs of the situation It is better said a writer in the Fortnightly Review that the war should destroy the traditional disorganization of democracy than that the traditional disorganization of demo cratic government should destroy democracy itself and the British race On the other hand protests were heard from the Liberal press not only to the effect that the new kind of govern ment created an autocracy without improving the organization of the administrative departments in any respect but alsothat it was dangerous that vital decisions which would end thewar or prolong it indefinitely should be taken by four or five men alone and that the ministers nominally responsible to Parlia ment for foreign policy the army and the navy should have only a consultative voice in their decisions The creation of the war cabinet and the manner in which it undertook to exercise its authority resulted in the practical suspension of parliamentary government Not only did the leading ministers discontinue attendance in Parliament but a number of the other ministers had no seats in Parliament so that information as to the policies of the government had to be obtained from undersecretaries while Mr Bonar Law the former Unionist leader now a member of the war cabinet acted as a sort of sentry set on guard to protect the inner cabal from parliamentary snipers ready to give the alarm should his defense of the government fail to allay distrust Thus the unity of the executive and legislative departments characteristic of the cabinet form of government was actually replaced by an auto572 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW cratic executive leaving Parliament with scarcely a semblance of its constitutional function of direction and control and with no legislative functions other than the occasional passage of laws called for by the cabinet The acquiescence of Parliament in so complete a reduction of its authority could only have been the result of its clear realization that it was better to give even a less efficient government a free hand than to risk the delays incident to change By contrast with the more practical attitude of the British Parliament the French chamber of deputies insisted upon exer cising its legislative functions Its great committees dealing with the army and with foreign affairs held practically continuous sessions to permit which the rules of parliamentary procedure were suspended and while abstaining from interference in military affairs the committees undertook to give orders to the executive department and to exercise a direct control over the administrative services of the government in order to insure that the supplies for the army should be equal to the emergency At the same time the chamber continued to hold the cabinet directly to account for its policies and cabinets headed by Viviani Briand Ribot and Painleve rose and fell in succession until the advent of Clemenceau in November 1917 gave stability to the government In spite of the emergency the French chamber departed little from its constitutional methods during the war insisting both upon dictating policies to the executive and upon criticizing the government for its failures In addition to the problem of reorganizing its government so as to secure a more efficient administration and a greater unity of control Great Britain was obliged to enlarge greatly the constitutional powers of the government On the one hand it was necessary to bring the entire industrial activities of the country to the support of the military forces and on the other hand restrictions had to be placed upon the normal freedom of the individual citizen in order to prevent interference with the conduct of the war Both of these objects were accomplished by the passage of the Defense of the Realm Act together with its successive amendments The assumption of control by theDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 573 government over the industrial resources of the country was gradual and tentative progressing by degrees from control over the essentials of military provisionment to the complete mobili zation of all resources including the production and consumption of food supplies The railroads were promptly brought under direct control of the government and their administration was placed in the hands of a committee of railway managers with the president of the board of trade as chairman Control over the coal mines was not at first deemed necessary but the refusal of the miners federation to accede to the regulations laid down for labor in other industries and the threat of an impending strike ultimately forced the government to take over the mines and a new department was created to administer them The prices of iron steel and copper were fixed and priority regula tions were drawn up in order to secure to the various industries their essential supplies in the order of their importance for the prosecution of the war Serious labor difficulties were experi enced from time to time in connection with the railways and the government was finally obliged to apply the law declaring strikes illegal until resort had first been had to the arbitration of the minister of labor Compulsory arbitration of disputes was pre scribed in the case of the munition factories and a drastic system of leaving certificates which later had to be abandoned was adopted in the effort to check the flow of labor from one factory to another On the whole the record of British war administra tion was marked by a gradual and tentative assumption of control over the national life resulting in delays which on more than one occasion were little short of fatal If British democracy was somewhat slow to realize the neces sity of assuming control over the industrial life of the country and slower still to organize its government upon an efficient basis it early recognized the necessity of placing restrictions upon the freedom of its citizen body in order to prevent the giving of aid to the enemy The Defense of the Realm Act and its amendments struck down at one blow the traditional rights of British citizenship and instituted a regime of military law which was nothing short of a revolution in British consti574 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW tutional procedure The Crown in Council was empowered to authorize the trial by court martial and in the case of minor offenses by courts of summary jurisdiction of persons violating the regulations prescribed These regulations were of a most sweeping character and were designed to prevent persons from communicating with the enemy from spreading false reports or reports likely to cause disaffection to the government and otherwise from giving assistance to the enemy or endangering the successful prosecution of the war Searches and seizures were authorized without warrant and on the mere ground that there was reason to suspect that the premises were being used in a way prejudicial to the safety of the realm Freedom of speech and of the press were both restricted to the point where it was legally possible to impose penal servitude upon the speaker or journalist who speculated upon the plan of campaign or criti cised the accommodations of the army camps Drastic as these regulations were the British public submitted with little resis tance realizing that the presence of enemy aliens made it neces sary to confer arbitrary powers upon the government and apparently confident that as soon as the emergency was over their traditional rights would be restored to them The difficulties experienced by British democracy in adapting itself to the demands of the war have resulted in a number of plans of reconstruction bearing both upon the organization of the government and upon its functions The most important of these plans perhaps have been those presented by the machin ery of government committee of the ministry of reconstruction The report of the committee first attempted to define more precisely the relations of the cabinet to Parliament It described the essential functions of the cabinet as consisting in the deter mination of the policies to be presented to Parliament the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy prescribed by Parliament and the continuous coor dination and delimitation of the activities of the several depart ments of state The tentative suggestion was made that the solidarity of the cabinet should be broken up by making the individual members responsible to Parliament and removableDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 575 by a vote of want of confidence It further advocated that the cabinet be reduced to a smaller body of ten or twelve members in place of the twenty or more members of 1914 At the same time the number of ministerial departments should be reduced in accordance with a scheme to distribute the business of govern ment into ten main divisions with occasional subdivisions In this respect the recommendations of the report form an interest ing subject of comparison with the present organization of the national government of the United States and with the schemes of administrative reorganization recently adopted by some of the separate state governments No general plan of admini strative reorganization has however been as yet actively under taken in Great Britain Two new ministries of health and transport have been established and substantially the prewar cabinet has been revived The difficulties confronting the government of the United States at its entrance into the war parallel in almost every case those experienced by the British government The outstanding difference between the political situation in the two countries was due to the omnipotence of Parliament on the one hand and the strict limitations of a written constitution on the other Parliament was the maker of the British constitution as well as its instrument of government and in consequence Parliament could reorganize and enlarge the executive department and could assume whatever powers were necessary to meet the emergency without question as to the constitutionality of its acts at the same time the unity between the executive and legislative departments prevented friction between Parliament as a legis lative body and the cabinet and ministry as its executive com mittee In the United States however there was the question as to the extent of the war powers of Congress and of the Presi dent there was the division of power between the central govern ment and the member states and there was the formal separation of the legislative and executive departments of the government The first and second of these constitutional difficulties were overcome without marked loss of efficiency but the lack of unity in the executive and legislative departments proved from576 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW beginning to end a serious handicap in the effective prosecution of the war The dissatisfaction of many of the leaders in Con gress with the personnel of the executive department and with its methods resulted in numerous investigations of boards and bureaus and in a longdrawnout contest between the President and Congress as to the means of putting into effect the much needed reorganization of the administrative departments The lack of unity was of course not wholly due to the system of checks and balances provided for in the Constitution Legally speaking there was nothing to prevent the closest cooperation between Congress and the President But as a practical matter the absence of any control by Congress over the President natur ally led it to view with suspicion the exercise by him of those comprehensive powers which it had itself conferred upon him Congress could make appropriations but it could not control the methods of spending the huge sums of money which it so freely granted Congress could bring the industries of the country under the direction of the government but it could not control the agencies set up by the President for the effective execution of the powers granted him In consequence the criticism in Congress of the conduct of the administration was for the most part destructive rather than constructive and had the effect rather of discouraging the country with the lack of progress made than of stimulating the executive department to greater efficiency in the prosecution of the war But making due allowance for the lack of cooperation between the President and Congress due to personal reasons it remains true that the constitutional separation of the legislative and executive depart ments resulted in constant friction in needless delay in the passage of the necessary legislation and in duplication of activi ties and extravagance of expenditure which under more critical circumstances might have proved disastrous to the country It is a significant feature of a constitution which in other respects narrowly hedges in the departments of the government that in respect to the conduct of war it confers comprehensive and unrestricted powers upon the President and upon Congress within their respective spheres The President is made comDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 577 manderinchief of the army and navy of the United States and of the militia of the several states when called into the actual service of the United States He is thus put in supreme control of the military conduct of the war and complete unity of military command is secured The powers of the President as com manderinchief are however limited to the direction of the army and navy and no new political powers may be assumed by him on the basis of that authority He may plan campaigns dispose of the military and naval forces direct operations and execute the provisions of military law but outside that sphere he may not constitutionally act without express warrant of Congress Exceptions from this rule occurred during the Civil War when President Lincoln in the effort to suppress opposition to the policies of the government authorized searches and seizures without warrant and in spite of the protest of the Supreme Court suspended the writ of habeas corpus During the recent war President Wilson kept more strictly within his constitutional powers but he did not hesitate to use the influence of his office as well as his power over foreign affairs to further the cause of the country His successive statements of the ideal objects for which the United States had undertaken to fight undoubtedly aroused an enthusiastic zeal in the minds of thousands who would have responded but lukewarmly to an appeal based upon the technical grounds of war At the same time the declaration of the President that the victory of the allied cause would insure the liberation of oppressed nationalities and the recognition of the principle of selfdetermination helped to weaken the allegi ance of large numbers within the ranks of the enemy armies But apart from those powers inherent in his office the President remained during the war as before merely the executive officer of the government unable to act upon his own initiative and obliged to bide the time of Congress before he could take the measures necessary to back up the army and navy with the required supplies of war It is important therefore to dis tinguish sharply between what the President could do independ ently as commanderinchief and what he could do only after Congress had specifically authorized him to act578 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW On its part Congress was for all practical purposes a legislature of unlimited powers By the Constitution Congress is given the power to raise and support armies The grant of power is comprehensive and unqualified ard it endows Congress with authority to take all steps necessary to the successful prosecution of war What if the measures taken by Congress come into conflict with the normal operation of the provisions of the Con stitution In such cases the war powers of Congress must be regarded as paramount The reserved rights of the separate states and the guarantees contained in the first eight amend ments must be restricted to the extent necessary to permit the free exercise of the war powers In the recent war demands had to be made upon the entire industrial resources of the country to furnish the materials needed to support the armies raised by the Selective Service Act and Congress was forced to bring under the control of the government a hundred forms of business life which in normal times would have been completely beyond its control In no instance was the constitutionality of the assumption by Congress of these new powers successfully contested The validity of the Selective Service Act was questioned as being in excess of the powers of Congress and in violation of other clauses of the Constitution but the court found no difficulty in disposing of the objections raised Comprehensive and farreaching as were the functions undertaken by the war industries board in deter mining priorities in respect to the production delivery and use of materials and supplies as well as in fixing prices and regulating methods of production no question was raised as to the authority of the council of national defense under whose direction it acted The Shipping Board Act of 1916 and its subsequent amendments brought the entire shipbuilding resources of the country as well as ships already registered under the direct control of the govern ment The production and distribution of food products and fuels was regulated and prices were fixed where necessary The operation of the railways telegraphs and telephones was taken over by the government in accordance with a contract for their use the terms of which were fixed by the government If theDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 579 government refrained from extending its control over the labor engaged in essential industries and preferred to have recourse to voluntary agencies for the settlement of industrial disputes it was not from lack of constitutional power to act in the case of the laborer as in the case of the employer and his factory Labor indeed successfully resisted the establishment of compulsory arbitration tribunals But while expediency dictated acquies cence in its attitude of opposition to any form of industrial conscription it would have been clearly within the power of Congress to have applied compulsion to workers in essential war industries as well as to the men in the army for whom the munitions were being made Constitutional objections were raised in a number of cases to the various laws passed by Congress to prevent interference with the conduct of the war In these instances the government was not calling upon the positive aid of the citizen in the prose cution of the war but was imposing restrictions upon the liberty of the individual and thus coming into conflict with the bill of rights of the Constitution The Espionage Act in its original form undertook to penalize the offense of making false state ments with intent to interfere with the prosecution of the war and particularly the offense of obstructing the operation of the draft act The amendment to the Espionage Act known as the Sedition Act was directed against interference with the sale of liberty bonds and against the use of language abusing the form of government of the United States the national flag or the uniform of the army or navy In both instances the freedom of speech guaranteed by the Constitution was held to be not absolute but conditional that is subject to such restraints as are necessary to protect the community against the menace of sedition or the defeat of its purposes in the war Greater diffi culty was experienced by the court in upholding the application of the Sedition Act owing to the more remote connection between language abusive of the form of government of the United States and the protection of the vital interests of the nation in the war and a strong dissenting opinion was rendered by Justice Holmes in a case involving such language when uttered under conditions580 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW which did not appear to him to indicate the intention of giving aid to the enemy Sharp discussion in Congress and in the press took place over the issue of a censorship of the press and in the face of strong opposition the provision asked for by the President was elimin ated from the Espionage Act A modified form of censorship was established which consisted in the voluntary submission of the press to the decision of the committee on public informa tion with regard to the expediency of publishing news items relating to the progress of the armies in the field It would seem clear however that if Congress had acquiesced in the view of the executive department and created a compulsory censorship similar to that set up in Great Britain by the Defense of the Realm Act the courts would have upheld its constitutionality The distinction is commonly made between a law penalizing statements made in contravention of regulations prescribed and a law requiring the approval of a board of censors before matter may be published Even the latter more drastic form of censor ship would appear to be justified if urgently necessary to prevent by anticipation the publication of injurious matter Doubtless it was inexpedient to establish such a censorship under the circumstances with which the United States was faced That it would have been constitutional if regarded by Congress as essential to the protection of the country may be confidently asserted It was in relation to the organization of the administrative departments that the system of the separation of the powers of government manifested its greatest weakness and compelled attention to the need of readjusting the relations of Congress and the executive Congress as we have seen put at the disposal of the President practically the entire resources of the country but being unable to control the President or the heads of the executive departments directly Congress could but look on with impatience at what it considered in many cases to be an inefficient and dilatory execution of the laws it had enacted The personal aloofness of the President and of some of his cabinet doubtless contributed to the lack of confidence of many in ConDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 581 gress but apart from these accidental reasons there was the inevitable tendency to criticize publicly and sharply simply because there was no other way of forcing a change in the methods pursued by the executive department In consequence of the lack of confidence of Congress in the efficiency of the conduct of the administration proposals were made that a new department or ministry of munitions should be created which should be given complete control over supplies of every kind for the army and navy but the opposition of the President led to the abandonment of the plan A more thorough going reorganization or rather reconstruction of the executive department was urged by the chairman of the committee on military affairs in the senate in the form of a war cabinet to be composed of three persons who should have the power to coordi nate and control the functions of all the executive departments and agencies The war cabinet would thus have been a small directorate exercising practically unlimited powers of control and leaving to the President only the power to review their decisions The opposition of the President to such a body was a foregone conclusion while the constitutionality of the proposed body was at least open to question As an alternative measure the President requested Senator Overman to introduce a bill which would permit the coordination and consolidation of the executive bureaus and agencies in the interest of economy and the more efficient administration of the government The bill was finally passed on May 4 1918 and empowered the President to redistribute the functions of the executive agencies and to make transfers both of functions and of personnel from one department to another but by reason of the long delay in the passage of the bill the President had already resorted to informal methods of coordinating the various bureaus and no sweeping changes were made as a result of his new powers Looking at the long controversy between the President and Congress it can not be doubted that the system of checks and balances provided for in the Constitution proved a very real source of trouble and was the cause of delays and inefficiency which a unified system of government under a cabinet responsible582 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW to the legislature might readily have prevented Cabinet government in Great Britain made mistakes of its own but at least in point of organization for effective action it had the advantage over the separation of powers by which the Consti tution of the United States originally sought to safeguard demo cratic government The internal organization of Congress was responsible for further friction in the operation of the governmental machinery but less difficulty was found in this case in providing a remedy Apart from the constitutional obstacle presented by a bicameral legislature with possibilities of delay resulting from the necessity of reconciling conflicting views of the two houses the committee system under which Congress is organized for legislation exhibited several features which were at once undemocratic and inefficient It so happened that the rule of seniority by which the chairmen of committees are chosen on the ground of length of service in Congress in several instances placed at the head of the important committees men echo were out of sympathy with the policies of the executive For example the chairman of the house com mittee on military affairs was so far opposed to the plan of raising an army by conscription that it became necessary to call upon the ranking Republican member of the committee a German by birth to take charge of the bill The chairman of the foreign relations committee of the senate as well as the chairman of the house committee on ways and means were both strongly opposed to the declaration of war Under such conditions it could scarcely be expected that prompt action would be taken by the committees in presenting the measures called for by the President and approved even by a majority of Congress itself A word must be said with respect to the relations between the national government and the governments of the several states Here in spite of the constitutional lack of unity a remarkable degree of cooperation was obtained In the first place the state governments were called upon to acquiesce in the encroachments upon their authority involved in the assumption by Congress of so large a control over the industrial life of the country The railway administration for example automatically cancelled aDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 583 large part of the authority of the state railway and public service commissions The establishment of cantonments in different parts of the country resulted in the creation of important com munities beyond the control of the state governments The Food and Fuel Control Act and the subsequent Wartime Pro hibition Act made deep inroads into the normal police power of the states In the second place the exceptional demands created by the war led the states as well as the national government to enter new fields of legislation in the endeavor to provide for special local needs which could not be met by general laws State councils of national defense were organized to cooperate with the national council in the work of mobilizing the resources of the state and maintaining law and order under the trying con ditions created by the war Special laws were passed to assist the families of men in service to regulate the use of food and fuel to remedy the shortage of labor and to check the activities of alien enemies and their sympathizers In the third place the necessity of securing cooperation between the administrative departments of the state and national govern ments led to the establishment of new and more intimate relations between them both in the form of conferences between the state governors and the secretary of war and in the form of local conferences between the governors of neighboring states hav ing special problems of their own On the whole the relations between the national government and the states during the war showed that the large powers of local selfgovernment possessed by the states although resulting in considerable duplication of effort and consequent lack of efficiency were not a barrier to cooperation in all the more important problems before the country while at the same time they had the effect of reconciling the population of the states to restrictions which might have created resentment if they had emanated from the central government alone The outstanding lessons of the war in respect to the organi zation and functions of the government bear chiefly upon the problem of readjusting the division of powers between the584 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW national government and the states and upon the problem of reorganizing the system of checks and balances within the national government itself Many of the powers which Congress was enabled to assume as implied in the power to raise and sup port armies were found to be powers equally needed in the times of emergency immediately following the war The Lever Food and Fuel Control Act was found useful both in restricting post war profiteering and in forming the ground of an injunction to restrain a general strike in the soft coal mines The conclusion is suggested that it might be advisable to confer upon Congress the power to do directly what it has been able to do only through the technical exercise of the war powers Already the powers of Congress over commerce between the states have been strained to the point of maximum elasticity in certain parts of the field of economic and social legislation Yet there is clearly need that Congress should possess for use in time of urgent need the power to control the distribution of the raw materials of industry by creating priorities for the more essential industries the power to fix the price of staple foodstuffs and of fuels the power to regulate the business of insurance and other similar powers which cannot be exercised effectively by the individual states It has long been recognized that the constitutional division between the powers delegated to the national government and those reserved to the states have left unoccupied areas between the prescribed limits of the national jurisdiction and the limits of individual state action The war powers of Congress led it to enter parts of this unoccupied area and it would seem that the time has come to confirm its right of legislation by consti tutional amendment The necessity of reorganizing the relations between the several agencies of the national government has been impressed upon the country even more forcibly since the signing of the armistice than during the actual period of the war The inefficiency in the conduct of the war resulting from the formal separation of the legislative and executive departments was rendered relatively insignificant in view of the positive accomplishments of the government The vast contribution made by the United StatesDEMOCRACY AND EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT 585 to the winning of the war makes criticism of incidental confusion and delay seem meaningless now that the crisis is over But the deadlock in the machinery of government which has come about as a result of the difference of opinion between the President and the majority of the senate with regard to the ratification of the treaty of peace forms an impressive lesson in the need of a change in the fundamental relations of the legislative and executive departments The proposal that a constitutional amendment should be adopted providing for the union of the two departments by the establishment of a responsible ministry is doubtless too novel to the public to be expedient at the present moment The government of the United States has developed along its present lines too long to be abruptly transformed with out serious political upheaval even if any large body of public opinion could be found to endorse the change More moderate proposals in the nature of transitional steps towards complete unity may however be advocated The most urgent of these is doubtless the adoption of the budget bill now pending in Congress the principle of which has been endorsed by both of the great parties A further suggestion recommends that the administration should propose and explain not only the budget but all of its bills openly in Congress and fix a time when they shall be considered and put to vote The initiative in legislation would thus be transferred to the administration with out however taking from Congress its coordinate power to act should the administration fail to do so The tendency would be for the administration to take over from the committees of Congress the task of framing the bills while Congress would exercise wider powers of criticism and control It is generally agreed that the price of democratic government under present conditions must be a greater or less degree of inefficiency With the most perfect machinery of government available democracy would still make but halting progress because of its unwillingness to put the necessary restraints upon its own extravagance and because of its choice of leaders who are either mediocre in ability or reluctant to put forward policies which may bring them into disfavor with current public opinion586 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW But accepting these conditions as inevitable it is still important to inquire whether improvements cannot be made in the existing machinery of government both to make it more responsive to the will of the majority and to enable it to carry out its desired objects with less friction and duplication of effort The experi ence of wartime administration in the United States has pointed the way to a number of readjustments which would give added efficiency to the government without loss of democratic control

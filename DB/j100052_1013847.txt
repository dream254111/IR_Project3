HON JAMES L SLAYDEN1 Formerly Member of Congress San Antonio Texas T HE importance of the question of immigration from Mexico can hardly be overestimated It has a direct bearing on the general subject of immigration which Congress has been considering for years and which has not yet been solved It is tied up with the greatest of all of our prob lems that of race mingling It may be roughly speaking considered from three angles economical racial and political Economically considered the Mexi can immigrant is usually well received Until a very recent time there has been no real protest for he nearly always went straight to the farms where his labor was most urgently needed or into domestic service where clamorous housewives welcomed him in spite of his hopeless inefficiency Having practically no training in the mechanic arts his occasional essay in that direction only excited the con tempt of tradeunionists He was not regarded as even a possible competitor for their jobs but there begin to be signs that the unionists are changing their minds in that respect with the natural resultant suspicion and an tagonisln When contractors for bar racks and other United States army buildings working on the extravagant cost plus 10 per cent plan in 1917 and 1918 employed hundreds of Mexicans as carpenters who hardly knew a saw Exchairman American Group of Interpar liamentary Union President American Peace Society Trustee Carnegie Endowment for In ternational Peace Member World Court League The EDITOR from a hammer and paid them six to seven dollars for an abbreviated eight hour day organized labor began to take notice They were not efficient but the 10 per cent was made bigger and bigger all the time The farmers and other employers of labor are still complaining that it ruined them and the farmers say that it is no longer possible to grow crops profitably FARAn EMPLOYMENT Farmers in the Southwest habitually plant more cotton than they and their families can cultivate even with the help of such laborers as are more or less permanently attached to the plan tations Cotton is an exacting crop and must have prompt attention at cer tain periods in its growth It matures during July August and September and if not picked harvested by the end of November it is in serious danger of being damaged by rain and storms Thus it becomes necessary to pick it with great haste and that makes strong competition for labor This same demand for labor in the fields empties the kitchens and arouses the indignation of housekeepers Indus trious capable cotton pickers earned from four to six dollars a day during the season just closed To supply this labor so urgently neededa necessity that has been em phasized by the movement of Negroes from the farmsit has been the prac tice for many years to bring in Mexi cans Before the enactment of the Con tract Labor Law it was easy to do this 121THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY Neighbors would combine and send an agent to Northern Mexico and he would bring back the number needed and distribute them among the farmers contributing to the enterprise As a rule these contracts between employer and employe were faithfully executed and time and time again the same Mexicans would return to Texas and work on the same farms Now and then one more ambitious than the rest would acquire land by lease or purchase and begin farming on his own account and one more piece of raw material was thrown into the Amer ican meltingpot Usually however they would go back to Mexico to dis play or dissipate their earnings for the average Mexican is as prodigal as the Negro who is perhaps the greatest spendthrift in the world The law that made it illegal to con tract for alien labor was a blow to the farmers and some of them through ignorance of the law found themselves in trouble with the Federal courts Its enforcement caused a serious strin gency in the farm labor market How ever the Mexicans who wanted to come to Texas to pick cotton and earn in six weeks more than they ordinarily earned at home in six months had learned when they would be needed and many came without contracts but with the certainty of employment Then in 1917 Congress put another barrier in the way of the cotton planter The entrance head tax wasincreased to eight dollars and the rules for in spection were made much more rigid It is doubtful if this law has had the effect of lessening legal immigration from Mexico to the United States but it has certainly increased the number of illegal entries For about a thousand miles Texas is separated from Mexico by the Rio Grande which for eleven months of the year can be waded by a tenyear old boy and it is much cheaper to wade than to pay the head tax of eight dol lars and so 75 per cent of the Mexican immigrants scorn the conveniences of the established stations and come over without the knowledge of the agents of the law There is evidence available to Amer ican officials that some of the under paid officers of Mexico have suggested through a friend to intending emi grants to the United States that if they must leave their own country they can avoid the examination fumigation and especially the tax of eight dollars by crossing above or below the estab lished stations and save at least four dollars the other four being paid to the friend of the officer Two Mexicans were arrested in San Antonio during the week in which this is written each of whom had on his person a card printed in Spanish say ing that the man who presented it would put intending emigrants into the United States for half the head tax exacted at the stations The card also said that the people who undertook to do this service were headquarters for the distribution of Bolshevist litera ture This story is from an absolutely reliable source It is not an exaggeration to say that threefourths of the immigrants from Mexico to the United States in the last three and a half years have come in illegally The demand for Mexican laborers is widespread and they can now be found as far north as Minneapolis and Chi cago and east to the Mississippi River Nearly all the great railways between the Alleghenies and the Pacific have some Mexicans employed as section hands The competition of railways for laborers from Mexico on whom farmers feel they have a prior claim is not welcomed by the latter They discovered them and first brought 122SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MEXICAN IMMIGRATION them over and they feel that they should be left for farm service It is becoming difficult to keep these imported workers on the farms for like the negroes they are gregarious want to be with their countrymen and have developed a taste for the movies and the white lights Equal remunera tion will take them all away from the farms and to the city as they never consider the increased cost of living there Ever since the head tax was doubled and more stringent regulations for the inspection of the immigrant to ascer tain his moral mental and physical fitness for residence or citizenship in the United States were put into opera tion there has been little or no decline in the authorized entries This is probably due to the fact that import ers of such labor urgently need the workmen and are willing to pay the tax to keep the immigrant in hand If he crossed illegally he would have to be hunted for in Texas and that would be an appalling task These admis sions by permission of the Department of Labor really appear to be in viola tion of the spirit and letter of the act of February 1917 The Commissioner General of Immigration in his report for the fiscal year of 1919 says that availing itself of the discretionary power conferred by Section 3 of the Immigration Law to admit for tem porary purposes aliens otherwise inad missible the department in answer to insistent demands authorized the sus pension of the contract labor head tax and illiteracy test provisions of that law in favor of aliens from Mexico coming to the United States for em ployment in agricultural pursuits as railroad laborers for certain work on buildings under construction by the Government or to do common labor in mines These insistent de mands were made by farmers railway officials Boards of Trade and other civic organizations Between July 1 1918 and July 30 1919 the period covered by the last available report there were admitted under these arrangements 20643 Mex ican aliens In the same year there were admitted 9000 others but pre sumably in full compliance with the text of the law All of them were dis tributed to Texas Arizona California Idaho and other states Farms took 10491 and the railways about 10000 Texas as usual absorbed the larger number At the present time the ad mission of aliens who do not meet the requirements of law is limited to farm labor yet the fact seems to be that once in the country these immigrants find a way to avoid the conditions of admission and join their fellow coun trymen who are employed in towns and on railways They dislike the comparative isolation of farm life and know that where two or three Mexicans are gathered together there is sure to be a game of chancea lure that few men of their race can resist During Feb ruary March and April of 1920 they came to Texas in appalling numbers There were so few immigration guards and officials on the border that it was impossible to stop the invasion Hun dreds of them ragged filthy paupers who could not have paid the head tax and crossed legally came with wives and children and made their way to San Antonio regarded by the average Mexican as the one real metropolis of the United States At times hundreds of them were trailing the roads between San An tonio and Laredo They came in any vehicle they could buy or get but by far the greater number were afoot without baggage or food To supply these deficiencies they would stop here and there to do a days work or beg and the beggars of Spain and Italy areTHE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY the merest amateurs compared to those of Mexico Two thousand or more of them were gathered in San Antonio at one time During March 1920 the Associated Charities had to feed three hundred or more daily for about a week while efforts were made to put them on a selfsupporting basis Inquiries at the Chamber of Com merce which had undertaken to find employment for them brought the in formation that they were distributed to farms and were being paid a wage of from a dollar and a half to two dollars per day On the other land a labor organization the Trades Assembly denied the statement of the Chamber of Commerce and contended that they were taking the places of mechanics and other workers in the town but as the writer has been told the Assem bly could not tell where they were em ployed nor from whom they got the in formation that they were so employed While these refugees from the pov erty and scorn of Mexico were eating the bread of charity in San Antonio the Fall committee from the Senate which seemed to be seeking a cause for quarrel with Mexico arrived They tried to find the cause for such an extraordinary invasion and to learn from what part of Mexico it came The local United States immigration office declares that the enquiry devel oped the fact that the greater number came from southern and central MIexico quite distinguishing it from the steacdy flow of immigration from the border states The witnesses said they came because it was impossible to get food and clothes in their own country that they were trying to es cape starvation and had walked most of the way They were headed for the Promised Land and no obstacle was insuperable As in all invasions of this sort more human derelicts were left in our larger towns more beggars appeared on our streets and the average of health in city and country was lowered appre ciably Life in the streets was made more picturesque and interesting for tourists and units to swell the census totals were acquired which in the minds of some people is compensation enough for the lowered standard of citizenship and the increased burden of taxation RACIAL AND POLITICAL This steady incoming of an alien race not altogether white is welcomed by some Americans tolerated by others and utterly abhorred by those who look beyond the next cotton crop or the betterment of railway lines Large planters short of labor be cause of the extraordinary hegira of Negroes in the last few years know their value and welcome the Mexican immigrants as they would welcome fresh arrivals from the Congo without a thought of the social and political embarrassment to their country On the other hand the small southern farmers and they are the greater num ber who cultivate their land with the help of their children do not want the Mexicans and would gladly see the movement of Negroes go on until the last one was settled in New England or Illinois or wherever they may be most happy prosperous and welcome But both Negroes and Mexicans are here yet in large numbers and close observers begin to detect a feeling of jealousy and dislike between them In Texas and other southern states the Mexican is classed as white in public conveyances hotels and places of amusement which does not make for good feeling between him and the Negro and the Mexican even of very low class is not much inclined to social intimacy with the latter 124SOME OBSERVATIONS ON MEXICAN IMMIGRATION That to substitute one for the other may be jumping from the fryingpan into the fire is a thought that will in trude itself Racially speaking the Mexican im migrant does carry an element of dan ger for it can not be denied that with the American masses who come in contact with him there exists a certain latent hostility That this prejudice is mutual is amply shown day by day by the tone of Mexican newspapers by the frantic appeals by the Mex ican demagogue by the testimony of travellers or American residents in Mexico and by certain fantastic proj ects entertained from time to time in official circles during the administra tion of President Carranza That he believed it possible to excite the Amer ican negroes to revolt is quite true and that his emissaries undertook to execute the foolish scheme can not be doubted Less than eight years ago a party of Mexican revolutionists as they called themselves invaded Texas declared the state reannexed to Mexico pro claimed the Plan of San Diego and promised social and political suprem acy to the negroes They killed a few citizens of the United States derailed a train and murdered the passengers and destroyed property the invariable curtain raiser to a Mexican revolution but some straightshooting Texans soon convinced them of the error of their way and those who could sit a horse hurried back to the southern side of the Rio Bravo Politically the Mexicans were vastly more important in Texas a few years ago than they are now The white population has increased much more rapidly than immigrants have come or Mexican children been born This has made them politically impotent in spite of the fact that they are easily gathered into clubs or juntas and voted solidly by their leaders Amend ed election laws also had a part in de stroying their political power Every voter now pays a polltax many months before the election and must make his own ballot Many Mexicans will not do the first and can not do the last This may not be true of the next gen eration as they attend our public schools without cost and are even pro vided with textbooks as freely as the children of our own citizens Until very recently citizens of Bexar county just outside of San Antonio men of business in the city and taxpayers have been compelled to pay a special fee if their children attended the city schools while those of Mexican refu gees driven from home by revolutions had textbooks and schooling without cost This condition had to be changed because of the growing indignation on the part of the overburdened American taxpayers In Texas the word Mexican is used to indicate the race not a citizen or subject of the country There are probably 250000 Mexicans in Texas who were born in the state but they are Mexicans just as all blacks are Negroes though they may have five generations of American ancestors Most Mexicans are Indians or Mes tizos mixed white and Indian blood and between them and the other in habitants of Mexico there is a sharply defined social distinction The upper classes of European ancestry are fre quently educated in Spain France or the United States and few of them be come immigrants unless forced out by revolutions when they go to San An tonio El Paso or Los Angeles At home they are the merchants big planters bankers and professional men With rare exceptions these people stay at home look after their private affairs and do not meddle with politics They would make good and useful 125THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY citizens of any country When one of them does go in for politics or revolu tion which is the same thing in Mex ico he does more mischief because above his wicked heart is a cleverer head He easily becomes the leader of the lowbrowed povertystricken peon class and by perfervid appeals to the prejudice of the thoughtless and un educated mass of Indians and the prom ise of an impossible Utopia quickly converts them into murderous bandits Resounding phrases about the Con stitution whether that of 1857 or that of Queretaro makes no difference and the rights of the Indians mixed with contemptuous remarks about the Gringoes and the hated Colossus of the North soon can make fiends of otherwise quiet and useful men Of all people trying to conduct gov ernment the Mexican is most in need of wise and firm leaders Of course it is perilous to say it at this time when the uplifter is abroad in the land but to the writer and to most others who know Mexico it seems essential if the country is ever to be lifted out of carnage and chaos to have some such man as Porfirio Diaz at the head of affairs After fiftysix years of the most chaotic and bloody conditions he did create an orderly and nation building government and that is what Mexico must have or perish Many people who know him hope that such a man has been found in Alvaro Obre gon These are the people high and low from whom thousands of immigrants are coming to the United States What it may mean for Americans in the future no one can tell Probably our safety and peace lie in the fact that as yet so few of them comparatively are coming Immigration Along Our Southwest Border By J BLAINE GWIN Secretary Associated Charities El Paso Texas PREVIOUS to 1910 the immigra tion from Mexico was due en tirely to economic causes Laborers came north with their families to work during the summer in the mines and at agricultural work but at the beginning of winter the majority would return to their homeland to spend their wages In Mexico during that time laborers were paid only about twentyfive cents a day Public records give only a very faint idea of the number that crossed the border previous to 1910 Little at tempt was made to keep track of the ebb and flow of the tide of Mexican laborers At the beginning of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 the rush of Aliens to cross over into America constituted a real menace to the health and stand ards of living for the border communi ties The principal cause of this in creased migration was revolutionary rather than economic The majority of these immigrants remained in the States until about 1915 and since that time there has been a fairly steady stream of returning refugees and laborers More have returned during the last few months than at any pre vious period due to the present peaceful conditions in Mexico Most of these came north with no money and little clothing sandals huraches instead of shoes wide sombreros and blankets wrapped around them instead of coats They are returning with rolls of money often several hundred dol 126

j100000,Science,1640667,The Diffusion of Gases at Low Pressures Made Visible by Color Effects,i296395,JULY 16 1915 SCIENCE has been displayed in recent years Most of the European nations which have possessions in Africa have sent scientific expeditions to that continent to study the insectborne dis eases In the case of England the Royal So ciety the Imperial Bureau of Entomology and the great schools of tropical medicine have sent such expeditions As there has been an urgent demand from administrative officers and others for early information on the subject of African insectborne diseases many of the commissions and investigators have published preliminary or progress reports from time to time The undertaking of the author of this book was to summarize and correlate as far as possible the findings of the different investigators which in many cases have not been harmonious Dr Hindle himself has conducted investigations in various parts of Adrica and adds his own views to those of other investigators on points which are by no means settled The general plan of the work is to combine the necessary entomological and medical fea tures of the problem so that the accounts of the different diseases will be complete In the treatment of diseases borne by mosquitoes for instance a full discussion of the classification of the mosquitoes is given This is followed by a series of chapters on the diseases such as malaria and yellow fever which these insects transmit The completeness of the work may be judged from the table of the two hundred and fortyone species of anopheles their classi fication and generic synonymy and notes on their habitat and connection with malaria Even with such complete special discussions the work is well balanced but its chief char acteristic is its inclusiveness and the good judgment the author has displayed in the ex clusion of immaterial details Dr Hindle lost his life in military opera tions in Africa where he was continuing his investigations of tropical diseases soon after the outbreak of the war He was a young man and would undoubtedly have made further valuable contributions to the study of insect borne diseases But the present book may be considered a monument that will mark his place which was an important one in the study of tropical diseases at a time when such work as his was much needed W D HUNTER SPECIAL ARTICLES THE DIFFUSION OF GASES AT LOW PRESSURES MADE VISIBLE BY COLOR EFFECTS AN interesting and instructive experiment for the lecture table is to connect a discharge tube AC which is about one meter or more in length and which has the exhaust nipple at one end to a pump that will give a Geissler vacuuman oil Geryk pump will answer very well Between the pump connection M and the valve 0 that closes the tube there should be fused a side branch N also having a valve Connect N by a rubber tube to some source of gas other than air e g ordinary illuminating gas The connection at M should be made direct to the pump Connect A and C to the terminals of an induction coil that will give a spark in air five or more centimeters long To operate close the valve in the branch N open 0 and evacuate the discharge tube to the point where on sparking the characteris tic strive show distinctly It is immaterial whether A or C is the cathode or whether the discharge is unidirectional Now close the valve 0 and with the pump still running open N partly allowing illuminating gas to be drawn by the pump through the branch OM thus displacing the air by the gas By closing N pumping and later admitting more gas every trace of air may be washed out of FIG 1 the tube leading up to 0 Now with N closed allow the pump to run for a few seconds until it is judged that the pressure in the connect ing tube MO is about that in the discharge tube AC At this stage everything is in readiness for the experiment namely the diffusion of gases at low pressures made visible by the color ef fect The wellknown characteristic color oi the discharge in the case of residual air con 93 nq HN S VOL XLII No 1072 taining possibly some water vapor is orange red To now introduce the illuminating gas open the valve 0 for a moment then close it The end C of the discharge tube is instantly filled with a beautiful greenishwhite color characteristic of illuminating gas This color will diffuse slowly towards A each color pal ing out and after three or four minutes the discharge throughout the tube will assume a uniform grayish hue The rate of diffusion is surprisingly slow and of course depends upon a number of factors e g the gas pres sure in the tube the pressure of the gas that is admitted the ionization within the tube due to the discharge passing through the tube the amount of moisture present etc If now the gas connection at N be removed and this stem opened to the air the pump and connections may be freed of gas and the in verse experiment performed namely that of introducing a small quantity of air The re sulting orange red color and its diffusion through the grayish hue of the illuminating gas is even more striking than the first The success of the experiment depends largely upon the skill of the operator in prop erly proportioning the quantity of gas to be introduced It is a very simple experiment to perform CHAS T KNIPP LABORATORY OF PHYSICS UNIVERSITY OF

Experiments on the Distillation of Liquid Air in a Magnetic Field Preliminary experiments on distillation of liquid air in a strong magnetic field indicate that there is an improvement in the separation of oxygen and nitrogen due to the influence of the magnetic field E P SCHOCH and DENTON J BROWN A Syste matic Rapid Electroanalytical Procedure for the Separation and Determination of Silver Arsenic Copper Bismuth Antimony Tin Lead and Cadmium In our earlier work published elsewhere we have shown that copper tin lead bismuth and antimony can be determined accurately by electro deposition out of acidified chloride electrolytes which contain suitable reducing agents such as hydroxylamine or formalin We have found since that copper bismuth and antimony can be de posited simultaneously and can be separated from tin and lead that tin and lead can be deposited simultaneously and separated from cadmium that copper or bismuth can be separated from anti mony by dissolving alloys of these metals in nitric acid plus tartaric acid and electrolyzing the so lutions with a limited cathode potential that bis muth phosphate can be precipitated quantitatively out of the same solution that tin may be sepa rated completely from lead by dissolving an alloy of these two metals in nitric acid plus potassium nitrate and that silver in silver chloride may be determined by dissolving the latter in ammonia adding ammonium nitrate and electrolyzing These facts are all combined in the following systematic procedure for the rapid electroanalytical determination of all the common metals the poten tials of which are more noble than that of cad mium A Dissolve sample in hydrochloric acid or in aqua regia an insoluble residuesilver chloride is dissolved in ammonia plus ammonium nitrate and the silver determined electrolytically B Treat solution A with hydroxylaminemer cury gold and platinum will be precipitated and can be determined by wellknown methods C Out of

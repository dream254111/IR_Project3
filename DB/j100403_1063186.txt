brought for ward many intricate problems with respect to the read justment of the worlds affairs Intimately connected with these problems there are many questions purely domestic in nature but nevertheless important in connection with the restoration of the internal affairs of this country to a normal or peace basis During the period in which the United States was actively en gaged in the rVar the necessity for prompt and vigorous action caused the adoption of many measures which were predicated upon the avowe disregard of statutory requirements which in times of peace were the established and recognized law of the land Conspicuous among these was the action taken by some of the executive departments of the Government and by many of the bureaus or boards which were established by the Govern ment for the special purpose of assisting in the conduct of the War These departments and boards with full official sanction and with universal recognition of the propriety of their action permitted and even required cooperative agreements and ac tivities in interstate trade and commerce which except for the exigency created by the Var would in all lrobability have met with official condemnation and attack as constituting a viola tion of the Sherman AntiTrust Law Under the spur of neces sity however and by reason of the high and patriotic purpose for which these things were done and especially in view of the expedition and efficiency which resulted therefrom these actions deservedly met with alprobationVIRGINIA LAW REVIEW As a result of the experience which was thus acquired show ing the efficiency and despatch with which intricate affairs of business could be conducted when conducted through intelli gent cooperation a body of opinion has arisen to the effect that the efficiency thus found to ensue from intelligent cooperation as contrasted with the slower and less efficient results following from unrestricted and enforced methods of competition could with advantage be adopted as a permanent system for the future conduct of the business of the country The exigency of war having however passed it is recognized that the cooperation which was permitted during the conduct of the War would now that the War is over be impossible because of the prohibitions of the Sherman AntiTrust Law Underlying a proper conception of the subject there are eco nomic and legal questions of comprehensive and intricate char acter so that an adequate treatment of the problem would require an extended discussion reaching the proportions of a treatise The necessary limits of this paper therefore compel its compression into a limited scope which will result in the views here presented being merely suggestive In order to set forth briefly the existing situation it is nec essary to make a brief review of the history of the Sherman AntiTrust Law Beginning with the early seventies the Standard Oil Company began to exert great power in the oil industry of this country so that within a few years it obtained a dominant position Following its example other important industries were brought within the control of large aggrega tions of capital with the result that most if not all of the im portant industries of the country were combined in huge corpo rations popularly designated trusts Widespread public objection and protest were caused by the growing power of these great organizations with the result that in 1890 Congress enacted the Sherman AntiTrust Law This law was under debate in Congress from 1888 to 1890 and received thoroughgoing and painstaking care on the See an article by the writer THE FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAW AND THE RULv OF REASON 1 VA LAW REV 188 2SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED part of statesmen many of whom occupied foremost positions in the profession of the law It is a significant fact that the de bates which thus occurred were limited entirely to the question of the necessity of disrupting and repressing these great trusts The debates disclose that no consideration was given to the ne cessity of any statute with respect to theenforcement of the common law doctrine against restraints of trade except in so far as that doctrine was capable of use as an instrument for the disruption and repression of the great trusts The multitude of cooperative agreements among competitors where the same fell short of monopoly or an effort at monopoly were not taken into account This view of the purpose which Congress had in enacting the Sherman Law is confirmed by the statement made by the Circuit Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in United States v Workingmens Amalgamated Council2 and which statement was quoted with approval by the Supreme Court in Loewe v Law lor3 and is as follows I think the Congressional debates show that the statute had its origin in the evils of massed capital but when the Con gress came to formulating the prohibition    it expressed it in these words Every contract or combina tion in the form of trust or otherwise in restraint of trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign na tions is hereby declared to be illegal The subject had so broadened in the minds of the legislators that the source of the evil was not regarded as material and the evil in its entirety is dealt with The new law thus enacted was first tested in the United States Supreme Court in the case of United States v E C Knight Co4 and upon the basis of that decision which hassince been the subject of strongly adverse criticism the new law was erroneously deemed by the profession and by the community gen erally to be inapplicable to the very combinations and trusts against which it was specifically directed Many years elapsed before this erroneous impression was corrected until finally  54 Fed 994 4 156 U S 1 208 U S 247 301 3VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW in 1911 the Supreme Court in the famous cases of the Stand ard Oil Company5 and the socalled Tobacco Trust6 defined the scope of that law in such manner as to leave no doubt that it was sufficient to carry out the purpose for which it had been enacted by Congress Since the decisions in those cases the Supreme Court has in many subsequent cases reaffirmed and reiterated the drastic power of the Sherman Law with respect to combinations or agreements in restraint of trade It is interesting both from an economic standpoint and from a juridical standpoint to note that coincidentally with the ren dition of these decisions directed against combinations in the nature of trusts the Federal courts have rendered decisions under the AntiTrust Law in which cooperative agreements among competitors in trade have likewise been declared unlaw ful even where their effect is not that of creating a monopoly It is out of this latter aspect of the matter that ever since the rendition of the decisions in the Standard Oil Company Case and the American Tobacco Company Case a sentiment has been developing in this country to the effect that whereas on the one hand the prohibitions of the Sherman Law have been wisely exerted against the great combinations in the nature of trusts and should continue to be so exerted its power on the other hand in preventing a great variety of cooperative agreements among competitors where monopoly is not aimed at or possible has been wrongly exerted to the economic detriment of the trade and commerce of this country Those who advance this view find encouragement in the fact that the condition mentioned exists in no other country than in the United States Particular reference is made by them to England They argue that although the common law doctrine forbidding restraints of trade which constitutes the fundamen tal basis of the Sherman AntiTrust Law had of course its origin in the ancient common law of England the courts of England have for many years past greatly relaxed the rigor and 5 Standard Oil Co v United States 221 U S 1  United States v American Tobacco Co 221 U S 106 4SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED severity of that doctrine whereas the courts of this country have maintained much of its original rigor Illustrations of this divergence may readily be found in the adjudicated cases In the Danbury Hatters Case7 the Circuit Court of Appeals declared certain acts which were considered in that case to be unlawful although to use the Courts words The impelling motive of the combination was an effort to better the condition of the combiners which except for the antitrust act might be proper and lawful In the appeal to the Supreme Court in the same case8 that Court after citing several of its previous decisions said that they hold in effect that the antitrust law has a broader appli cation than the prohibition of restraints of trade unlawful at common law This statement is particularly significant as emphasizing the wide distinction prevailing between the course of the decisions in England and in the United States with respect to the subject under consideration The courts of England have steadily nar rowed and relaxed the scope of the common law doctrine for bidding restraints of trade whereas the cited case shows that the Supreme Court has construed the Sherman Law as having a broader application than the doctrine in question had at com mon law Further discussion would therefore seem unnecessary to es tablish the contention here put forth of the great divergence existing between the courts of the two countries in the respect now being considered In United States v Chesapeake  Ohio Fuel Co9 the Court in granting an injunction against a combination affecting the coal industry said It is said however that the increase in the volume of trade the competition in a larger field of operations the better condition of the product and the maintenance of reason able prices resulting from the performance of the contract benefit the public and justify the partial restraint of trade 7 Loewe v Lawlor 187 Fed 522 109 C C A 288 8 208 U S 274 297 9 105 Fed 93 5VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW But the policy of the law looks to competition as the best and safest method of securing these benefits and not to combinations which restrain trade     The important question is not whether the performance of the contract so far has resulted in actual injury to trade but whether the contract confers power to regulate and restrain trade upon those charged with its performance The attempt to confer power to regulate and restrain in terstate commerce by contract is a usurpation of the func tions of Congress and cannot be sustained upon the ground that trade has not in fact been injured Upon an appeal from the foregoing decision the Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the Court below and said that the Congress is given by the Constitution the power to regulate commerce between the States and with foreign Na tions and continued   In the exercise of this right congress has seen fit to prohibit all contracts in restraint of trade It has not left to the courts the consideration of the question whether such restraint is reasonable or unreasonable or whether the contract would have been illegal at the common law or not     The courts are not concerned with the policy of such a law It is not for them to inquire whether it be true as is often alleged that this is a mistaken public policy and combinations in the reduction of the cost of production cheapened transportation and lowered cost to the con sumer have been productive of more good than evil to the public    And it is argued that the main purpose of this agreement being to increase the trade of the parties to enhance competition in a larger field and improve the character of the product these objects are beneficial to the public as well as to the private parties lawful in their scope and pur pose and justifying the indirect and partial restraint of trade involved in the execution of the agreement    Wider markets and more trade may be the inducements to such agreements but they are purposes which the Act of Congress does not permit to interfere with the freedom of interstate traffic    Chesapeake  Ohio Fuel Co v United States 53 C C A 256 115 Fed 610 6SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED We have cited from this case at some length in order to point out the striking contrast which it presents to the decision of the Privy Council of England in the Australian Collieries Case which will be discussed belowa case relating to the same in dustry as in the cited case and presenting a state of facts largely similar to the facts in the cited case if not indeed showing a stronger situation in violation of the common law doctrine but nevertheless declared lawful by the courts of England The comparison of the English decision with the cited case presents conspicuously the wide divergence existing in the decisions of the courts of England and of the United States with respect to the doctrine here under consideration In Standard Sanitary Mfg Co v United States11 the Su preme Court speaking of the provisions of the AntiTrust Law said Nor can they be evaded by good motives The law has its own measure of right and wrong of what it permits or forbids and the judgment of the courts cannot be set up against it in a supposed accommodation of its policy with the good intention of the parties and it may be of some good results It is thus seen that the Sherman Law has been given a most comprehensive and drastic interpretation by the Federal courts so that practically all agreements among competitors whereby competition among them is substantially reduced are declared unlawful without respect to the fact that such agreements may be based upon good motives and upon beneficial economic results A similar severity of construction is to be found in the de cisions of the State courts in their interpretation of the common law doctrine in question A typical illustration of this nature is to be found in the leading case of Richardson v Buhl2 in which the Court said It is no answer to say that this monopoly has in fact re duced the price of friction matches That policy may have been necessary to curb competition The fact remains that it rests in the discretion of this company at any time to raise the price to an exorbitant degree 7 n 226 U S 20 u 77 Mich 632 43 N W 1102VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Similarly in the case of Anderson v Jett13 the Court said The combination or agreement whether or not in the par ticular instance it has the desired effect is void The vice is in the combination or agreement The practical evil ef fect of the combination only demonstrates its character but if its object is to prevent or impede free and fair com petition in trade and may in fact have that tendency it is void as being against public policy These cases shov that the principles therein defined are con trary to the principles upon which similar cases have been uni formly decided in the courts of England The cited cases show that it is the settled policy of the courts of this country both Federal and State to interpret cases arising under the common law doctrine forbidding restraints of trade upon the basis of the power or opportunity for wrongdoing and not the actual perpetration of a wrong As will be shown below the courts of England have regard only to the actual evil done as a result of such contracts or combinations rather than to the power to do such evil Ve believe it a proper assertion to make that it is largely upon this principle that the basis is to be found for the divergent course of the decisions in the courts of England as compared with the courts of this country with respect to the doctrine under consideration In addition to this radical difference which exists between the interpretation as given by the courts of England and by the courts of this country there is a further important distinction to be found in the fact that much greater latitude and liberality are shown by the courts of England in passing upon cases where a combination or agreement has actually resulted in the carry ing out of the purposes of the combination or agreement by the raising of prices or other similar effects In the courts of Eng land not only is the mere power for wrongdoing disregarded as a basis for the condemnation of a given situation but even where such power has been exercised with the result for ex ample that prices have been raised to the advantage of the com biners or what is more even where competition has been sup pressed to the advantage of the combiners the courts of Eng 13 89 Kv 375 12 S W 670 6 L R A 390 8SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED land have uniformly refused to declare the combination unlawful merely because of those results but have gone further and have considered whether or not the accomplishment of those results is in fact injurious to the public welfare Important typical illustrations of English decisions of this character are 1 the case of Mogul S S Co v McGregor Gow  Co14 and 2 the case of Attorney General of the Common wealth of Australia v The Adelaide S S Co5 The former case was decided upon the common law doctrine while the latter case was decided upon an Australian statute somewhat similar to our Sherman AntiTrust Law In each of these cases a result was reached which is wholly at variance with the results uniformly reached in similar cases which have been decided by the courts of this country 1 THE MOGUL STEAMSHIP CASE The Mogul case was an action brought by a rival firm of the defendants for damages for a conspiracy to prevent the plain tiffs from conducting the tea carrying trade between China and England under a state of facts which leaves no room for doubt that in a similar action brought under the Sherman AntiTrust Law the combination complained of would have been con demned In the interest of brevity we state the purposes of the combination in the language used by Sir Frederick Pollock Professor of Jurisprudence at Cambridge University Law Quarterly Review 1890 as follows    to grant a rebate to persons employing exclu sively the ships of the conference whilst refusing it to any one who employs a nonconference ship and in case any nonconference steamer should attempt to load cargoes at Hankow then to send as many conference ships as may be needed to underbid the independent steamer without any regard to profit It cannot be questioned that in an action based upon this state of facts and brought under the Sherman AntiTrust Law the courts of this country would have declared the combination 4 L R 21 Q B Div 544 L R 23 Q B Div 598 1892 A C 25 13 1913 A C 781 Law Journal 1914 Privy Council p 84 9VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW to be unlawful The courts of England however declared it lawful Sir Frederick Pollock thus states the substance of the decision of the English court The decision    rests on the broad principle that com petition however severe and egotistical if unattended by circumstances of dishonesty intimidation molestation or other distinct illegalities gives rise to no cause of action at common law and what is even more important that any form of competition which would not be unlawful on the part of an individual does not become unlawful be cause it is carried out by a combination of individuals act ing in concert This latter doctrine has been repeatedly negatived in the courts of this country A type of these cases is People v North River Sugar Ref Co16 where the Court of Appeals of the State of New York said It is not a sufficient answer to say that similar results may be lawfully accomplished that an individual having the necessary wealth might have bought all these refineries manned them with his own chosen agents and managed them as a group at his sovereign will For it is one thing for the State to respect the rights of ownership and pro tect them out of regard to the business freedom of the citi zen and quite another thing to add to that possibility a further extension of those consequences by creating artifi cial persons to aid in producing such aggregations The individuals are few who hold in possession such enormous wealth and fewer still who peril it all in a manufacuring enterprise but if corporations can combine and mass their forces in a solid trust or partnership with little added risk to the capital already embarked without limit to the mag nitude of the aggregation a tempting and easy road is open to enormous combinations vastly exceeding in number and in strength and in their power over industry any possibil ities of individual ownership and the State by the creation of the artificial persons constituting the elements of the combination and failing to limit and restrain their powers becomes itself the responsible creator the voluntary cause of an aggregation of capital which it simply endures in the individual as the product of his free agency What it may  121 N Y 582 24 N E 834 10SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED bear is one thing what it should cause and create is quite another Against this statement we quote the following from the opin ion in the Mogul Case in the Court of Appeal17 But I find it impossible myself to acquiesce in the view that the English law places any such restrictions on the combi nation of capital as would be involved in the recognition of such a distinction If so one rich capitalist may inno cently carry competition to a length which would become unlawful in the case of a syndicate with a joint capital no larger than his own The necessary limits of this paper make it impossible to set forth a complete and adequate discussion of the Mogul Case as a basis for the assertion that it presents in comparison with sim ilar cases decided in this country a farreaching relaxation of the common law doctrine of restraints of trade In the interest of brevity it may be stated as illustrating the point under dis cussion that in the briefs submitted by counsel when the Mogul Case was under consideration by the House of Lords the counsel for the plaintiff cited in support of the contention that the com bination created by the defendants was unlawful a series of leading cases decided by the courts of this country and which have been uniformly accepted by us as authoritative and that in the brief in reply presented by the counsel for the defendants Sir Charles Russell later the Lord Chief Justice of England met these cases with the statement None of the American de cisions cited are of great authority The opinions rendered by the judges who wrote the opinions for the House of Lords in substance and effect sustained the view thus stated by the counsel for the defendants and the opinions themselves reveal that in many important particulars the doctrines enunciated in the Mogul Case are irreconcilably opposed to similar doctrines enunciated in like cases in this country The decision in the Mogul Case has been adhered to by the courts of England in all cases subsequently decided8 It is quite natural therefore to find that in Great Britain  L R 23 Q B Div 598 617  North Western Salt Co v Electrolytic Alkali Co 1914 A C 461 11VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW combinations and likewise cooperative agreements of an in finite variety of character are in free and undisturbed existence It is within bounds to say that practically all of the important industries of Great Britain are the subjects of agreements of a cooperative nature which in the United States would be de clared unlawfull1 2 THE AUSTRALIAN COLLIERIES CASE Perhaps a more striking illustration of the wide divergence between the decisions of the courts of England and the courts of this country is to be found in the decision rendered by the Privy Council in the Australian Collieries Case20 The Aus tralian Government through its Attorney General brought the suit upon the charge that practically the entire coal industry in Australia had been made the subject of an agreement to which the coal operators the coal carrying railroads and steamship lines and the wholesalers and the retailers in the coal industry were parties It was charged that under this agreement the coal operators had agreed as to the respective quantities of coal which should be produced at each mine that the steamship owners and the railway owners had agreed as to the freight rates to be charged that the coal operators and the wholesale dealers had agreed upon the prices to be charged to the whole salers and the prices at which the wholesalers should sell to the retailers and that the retailers in turn had agreed as to the prices at which they should sell In effect the agreement ap portioned and allotted the output of the mines it fixed the rates that the steamship and railway companies should charge it fixed the price of the coal from the producer to the wholesaler from the wholesaler to the retailer and from the retailer to the consumer It is significant to add that the ultimate result was that the price of coal to the consumer was increased over what it had previously been The suit was brought under an Austral ian statute Australian Industries Preservation Act 1906 9 See The Trust Movement in British Industry by Henry W Ma crosty 20 Attorney General of Australia v Adelaide S S Co supra 12SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED which in a general way resembles the Sherman AntiTrust Law The substantive portion of the Australian statute is as follows Sect 4Any person who either as principal or as agent makes or enters into any contract or is or continues to be a member of or engages in any combination in relation to trade or commerce with other countries or among the States a with intent to restrain trade or commerce to the detriment of the public or b with intent to destroy or injure by means of unfair competition any Australian industry the preservation of which is advantageous to the Commonwealth hav ing due regard to the interests of producers workers and consumers is guilty of an offense The statute then proceeds with a further provision to the ef fect that every contract made or entered into in contravention of this section shall be absolutely illegal and void It is to be noted that the phrase in the quoted statute to the detriment of the public and the further phrase contained in it having due regard to the interests of producers workers and consumers have no corresponding counterparts in the Sherman AntiTrust Law The decisions under the latter law however make clear that the courts of this country have interpreted the Sherman Law in the same manner as if those phrases had been therein contained It is perfectly manifest that the combination thus assailed would have been declared unlawful if the suit had been brought in this country under the Sherman Law21 The courts of Eng land however declared it lawful and dismissed the suit Examples taken from the opinions rendered by the English courts in this case reveal the broad distinction which those courts make in their interpretation of the law of restraints of trade as contrasted with the interpretation made by the courts of this country Lord Parker writing for the Privy Council said Contracts in restraint of trade were subject to somewhat 1 See Chesapeake  Ohio Fuel Co v United States supra 13VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW different considerations There is little doubt that the com mon law in the earlier stages of its growth treated all such contracts as contracts of imperfect obligation if not void for all purposes they were said to be against public policy in the sense that it was deemed impolitic to enforce them and not because every such contract must necessarily op erate to the public injury The old common law rule against enforcing such contracts has however been re laxed in more recent times       It is however in their Lordships opinion clear that the onus of showing that any contract is calculated to produce a monopoly or enhance prices to an unreasonable extent will lie on the party alleging it and that if once the Court is satisfied that the restraint is reasonable as between the parties this onus will be no light one       The right of the individual to carry on his trade or business in the manner he considers best in his own in terests involves the right of combining with others in a common course of action provided such common course of action is undertaken with a single view to the interests of the combining parties and not with a view to injure oth ers   The expert student of the subject will readily perceive that this is in sharp opposition to the cortesponding doctrine prevail ing in this country Interesting light is thrown upon the view taken by Lord Parker where in the course of his opinion he alludes to the Sherman AntiTrust Law as follows In the argument upon the true construction of the Act of 1906 considerable stress was laid on the cases decided by the Supreme Court of the United States under the analo gous statute known as the Sherman Act and in particular on the case of Standard Oil Co of New Jersey v United States 221 U S 1 Although the judgments in this case are valuable for the light they throw on the develop ment of the common law touching monopolies and con tracts in restraint of trade their Lordships do not think that the decisions themselves are of any real assistance in the present case The Sherman Act construed strictly makes every contract or combination in restraint of trade and every monopoly or attempt to monopolize a statutory misdemeanor irrespective of any sinister intention on the 14SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED part of the accused and irrespective of any detriment to the public Contrary to the uniform view maintained by the courts of this country that it is the power for causing detriment to the public rather than the doing of acts detrimental to the public which controls the Privy Council then proceeded to make a de tailed study of the situation existing in the coal industry in Aus tralia and pointed out that ruinous conditions of competition had been existing which the combination under attack had al layed and that there was no evidence at any rate no suffi cient evidence of injury to the public The result of such study is shown by the following quotation which will be read ily perceived to be at variance with enunciations in correspond ing situations made by the courts of this country    It can in their Lordships opinion never be of real benefit to the consumers of coal that colliery proprie tors should carry on their business at a loss or that any profit they make should depend on the miners wages be ing reduced to a minimum Where these conditions pre vail the less remunerative collieries will be closed down there will be great loss of capital miners will be thrown out of employment less coal will be produced and prices will consequently rise until it becomes possible to reopen the closed collieries or open other seams The consumers of coal will lose in the long run if the colliery proprietors do not make fair profits or the miners do not receive fair wages    These statements are strikingly significant and have an un familiar sound to students of the American doctrine The foregoing views with respect to these two leading cases are given as showing the wide distinction existing between the doctrine under consideration as enunciated by the respective courts of England and of this country The limits of this paper forbid although an adequate presentation of the subject would compel a more elaborate and detailed presentation of the two cited English cases We believe however that sufficient has been shown there from to make clear that in this country the common law doc trine forbidding restraints of trade and the Sherman AntiTrust 15VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW Law which is based upon that doctrine are interpreted with a degree of rigor and severity far beyond that with which they are interpreted by the courts of England In so far as the American courts have thus maintained the rigor of the common law against the practices and the existence of combinations in the nature of trusts or monopolies there can be no question that the spirit and sentiment of this country fully sanction and support the same In so far however as such interpretation is extended to the prohibition of the infinite va riety of trade agreements designed to promote efficiency and economy and to diminish wasteful and ruinous methods of com petition it is a question justifying serious thought whether the more lenient methods pursued by the courts of England could not with advantage be adopted by the Congress and the courts of this country The American cases which have been cited in the earlier part of this paper show that cooperative agreements even when based upon good motives and when producing good results are nevertheless condemned because of the fact that they re strain the freedom of action of the parties to the agreement thereby in the view of our courts creating an unlawful restraint of trade If some method could be devised whereby agreements of this character when concededly based upon good motives and productive of good results could be differentiated from agree ments of sinister purpose and producing harmful results and be deemed lawful while the latter should continue to be deemed unlawful it seems clear that the result would be economically advantageous The history of the Sherman Law and the debates in Con gress upon which its enactment was based indicate that it was purposely framed on broad and comprehensive lines with the single and declared purpose of attacking destroying and re pressing the great aggregations of capital which were then menacing the orderly conduct of the business affairs of the country and making difficult if not impossible full and fair competition upon the part of independent traders Its later development shows that the broadly comprehensive character of its language caused the courts of this country to bring within 16SHOULD THE SHERMAN LAW BE REVISED its prohibitions not merely these great aggregations of capital but an infinite variety of cooperative agreements which did not possess any of the qualities of a trust It is suggested that per haps an orderly method may be devised whereby the Sherman AntiTrust Law may by suitable amendment be restored to what appears to have been its original purpose at the same time establishing suitable safeguards whereby agreements lacking the elements of monopoly may be legalized in such manner as to prevent their being developed into agencies of monopoly There are indications of a changing attitude on the part of Congress and of the American courts in the direction of a re laxation of the severity of the law on this subject and of its interpretation On the part of Congress this is shown by the recent enactment April 10 1918 by Congress of the socalled WebbPomerene Law which in substance removes the prohi bitions of the Sherman Law with respect to combinations or agreements operative in foreign countries This law is still in its experimental stage and its efficacy cannot therefore yet be determined By express terms however the WebbPomerene Law leaves unimpaired the prohibitions and penalties of the Sherman Law with respect to combinations or agreements op erative within the United States and to this important extent therefore the new law makes no change in the situation It nevertheless represents a pronounced change on the part of Con gress worthy of the attention of students of the subject as per haps indicating a changing public policy On the part of the courts while the assertion must be made with some caution there seem grounds for the belief that in some recent decisions the Federal courts have indicated a pur pose to interpret the existing law with greater liberality Cases of this nature are cited below22 A

impossible in the present pa per It is deemed proper to say that the student of the subject will gain an imperfect understanding of the existing situation without a careful examination of these cases A general survey of the situation sought to be exhibited in the foregoing pages may be thus stated The Sherman Law was enacted for the purpose of disrupting the great trusts It was framed in such comprehensive language as to bring within its scope not merely trusts but also every kind of cooperative agreement which materially lessened the power of competition among the parties to such agreement Prior to the enactment of the Sherman Law there was no Federal statute on this subject Both prior to the time of such enactment and subsequent there to the State courts had with practical uniformity construed and interpreted the common law doctrine forbidding restraints of trade with only slight abatement of its ancient common law rigor23 The Federal courts at first interpreted the Sherman Law in such manner as to make it futile in the disruption of trusts24 Subsequently beginning with the case of Addyston Pipe  Steel Co v United States25 the Supreme Court gave to the Sherman Law a rigorous interpretation of even broader ap plication than the common law doctrine upon which the Sher man Law was based culminating in a series of important deci sions which gave to the Sherman Law the maximum of severity and power On the other hand the courts of England have steadily re laxed the severity of the common law doctrine in question so that it is measurably within bounds to say that within the juris diction of the courts of England that doctrine has in large part lost its potency Amid much confusion of thought due to the intricacy of the See Diamond Match Co v Roeber 106 N Y

LAW BE REVISED subject and the conflicting interests affected there has arisen in this country a sentiment demanding a modification of the Sher man Law so as to liberate from its prohibitions many classes of cooperative agreements such as price agreements intended to prevent ruinous and wasteful competition and other like agree ments where it is claimed that the quality of monopoly does not exist and would probably not be possible of attainment With the purpose of clarifying the situation Congress enacted the socalled Clayton Law It is claimed that the effect of the Clay ton Law in clarifying or ameliorating the situation has been futile26 Quite recently the Congress has made in the WebbPomerene Law a radical change by withdrawing the prohibitions of the Sherman Law with respect to foreign trade and likewise quite recently the Federal courts have in a number of important cases rendered decisions which seem to indicate a marked change in the direction of a relaxation of the doctrine in ques tion The subject is one of great importance and it involves intri cate questions of economic principle and policy As was stated at the outset of this paper the scope of the subject is such as to require for its proper presentation a discussion reaching the proportions of a treatise The present paper has attempted merely to indicate in as brief a form as possible the salient features of the subject Felix H Levy NEW YORK CITY  See an article by the writer The Clayton LawAn Imperfect Sup plement to the Sherman Law 3 VA LAW REV 411 19

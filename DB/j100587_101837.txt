Standards compared with ours of England By Richard Cumberland D D in Octavo London 1686 THe Learned Author of this Treatise has with a great deal of Industry and Judgment Collected the several Testimonies both Ancient and Modern Sacred and Profane that may give any light into the discovery of the Ancient Jewish Weights and Measures In the doing whereof he re lies chiefly upon the Tryals of Mr Greaves whose Integri ty was never yet questioned and who with his own hands compared our English Standard Foot with the several Foreign Measures our Author has occasion to use The Book con sists of Four Chapters whereof the first by way of Preface gives an account of the Method proper to be used in this Discovery The second proves by many Arguments the like lihood that the Jewish Ammah or Cubit was the same with the present Egyptian Cubit to do which he alledges that the usual Rise of Nilus necessary for the fertilizing of Egypt was in the days of Herodotus as well as now about 16 Cubits whence he concludes that the old Cubit of Egypt is not al tered but the Divisions on the Nilometrion are the same as in all Antiquity Also that the constant necessity of Survey ing their Lands by reason the Annual overflowing does Efface their Landmarks obliged them to observe a con stant Standard to avoid confusion Next he alledges this Cu bit not to have been altered by any Conquest the Babylonian Cubit of Five Palms being shorter and that of Six being the same that their next Conquerors the Greeks and Romans have their  considerably shorter and that the Turks their present34 present Masters have not introduced theirs which is much longer as appears by Mr Greaves  He proves out of Greaves that the side of the Great Pyramideand the length of the Tomb therein are measured by an even Number of such Egyptian Cubits wherefore he concludes they were so disigned at first viz the Side of the Pyramide to be 380 Cu bits and the length of the Tomb just Four which carries with it a great shew of probability This done he proves the Jewish Cubit the same with the Egyptian Cubit by se veral probable Arguments among which the chief seems to be That the whole Nation of the Jews had been for so many years Subjects of Egypt and carried undoubtedly a way with them their Weights and Measures and there is no Testimony or Reason to prove that the Jews have since al tered them Hence he concludes the Old Scripture Cubit 21 9 Inches English fere equal to what Mr Greaves found the modern Egyptian Cubit and so makes a Table of all the 0 ther Measures whose proportions to the Cubit are agreed upon The third Chapter treats of the Epha and the other Mea sures of Capacity endeavouring to prove the Content of Epha equal to 16 of the Ardub or Cube of the Egyptian Cubit that is Seven Gallons and half and half Pint Circiter or very near the Cube of a Foot English and containing just 1000 Ounces  of Water for the which he produces such Authorities and compares them so well together that he has almost put it out of doubt giving at last a Table of the Contents of all the other ScriptureMeasures of Capacity having a known relation to the Epha The fourth Chapter treats of the Weights and Coyns men tioned in Scripture and having by Tryal as well as Autho rity found the Weight of Shekel just half the Roman Ounce equal to the half Ounce  he determins its value 2 s 4 d 14 and thence derives the value of the Gold and Sil ver Talent weighing 3000 Shekels  He recommends for a Universal Standard the length of the Pendulum vibra ting35 ting Seconds to be the  Yard which he says is 3 Foot 3 14 Inches English following therein the Ingenious Mr Hu gens the first Proposer thereof By the way he takes notice of the Harmony that is between the Measures and Weights thus stated for having the Egyptian Cu it given the sixth part of its Cube is the Epha the tenth thereof Homer the tenth of that Cotyla the tenth of which is an Ounce   in Water whose half is exactly the Weight of Shekel The whole Book being made up of very rare Remarks is well worth the perusal of the Curious Reader Note That the Learned Dr Edward Bernard in his late Ac count of Weights and  agrees nearly in the Capa city of Epha with what Dr Cumberland has determined for he makes the Cube of the English Foot to contain 76 l Troy of Springwater and the Epha or rather Bath to contain 75 such Pounds so that it is a Pound less than the Cube of a Foot English which Dr Cumberland has stated about 12 Ounces of Water more than the said Cube And whereas Dr Bernard says the Epha contains 9 Gallons tis a plain mistake of the Printer of 9 for 7 for the Cube of a Foot which is by his own account greater than Epha scarce holds 7 Gallons and half such as by Statute are to contain 231 Cube Inches As to the Value of Shekel Dr Bernard says that none but Bi shop  ever made it so little as 2 s 5 d which yet Doctor Cumberland has reduced to 2 s 4 d 1 4 Ephemeris ad Annum a Nativitate Domini 1686 ad Longitudinem

tollerable exactness several of our Astronomers were perswaded to undertake the Calculation of one for this E present36 present Year which they have done from Tables of their own whose Numbers by many years observation have been found to answer with great preciseness to the Celestial Mo tions the Moon only excepted whose Motion by reason of her manifold Inequalities not being yet reduced to the Ni

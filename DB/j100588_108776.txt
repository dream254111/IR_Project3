Compass observed on board of all the Ironbuilt Ships and a selection of the Woodbuilt Steamships in Her Majestys Navy and the Iron Steamship  Great Eastern being a Report to the Hydrographer of the Admiralty By FREDERICK J EVANS Esq Master RN Superintendent of the Compass Department of Her Majestys Navy Communicated by Captain WASH INGTON RN BRS by command of the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty Received MIay 5Read June 21 1860 SIR London April 18 1860 IN compliance with the general instructions I received from you on my appointment to observe carefully the working of the Mariners Compass in the ships of Her Majestys Navy and especially in iron vessels both for the security of their navigation and the aid of science I now beg leave to submit for your consideration the following Report treating on these points and in which is embodied an analysis of the magnetic character of all the ironbuilt ships in Her Majestys Navy as also of several of the woodbuilt steamships In directing attention to this analysis as given in a series of Tables it is necessary to advert to the observations on which it is based as resulting from a general system pursued in the Royal Navy On the foundation of the Compass Department in 1843 a periodical examination of the disturbance caused by the iron on the compass in each shipor the deviation of the compass as it is now familiarly known to seamenwas directed to be made by the Lords Commissioners of the Admiralty the records of this examination are duly pre served in the Hydrographic Office and have been employed in this investigation The compass specially selected at this period and since retained with a few modifi cations for the navigation of Her Majestys ships and with which all observations for the deviation are made and to which the steering or binnacle compasses of the ship are referred is well known as the Admiralty Standard This compass is solidly fixed in the middle line of the ship within the limits of the quarterdeck generally at a distance from the stern varying from onefifth to onetenth of the vessels length and raised sufficiently high from the deck to secure bearings of terrestrial objects above the gunwales or bulwarks which ensures a height varying from about 4 feet 6 inches to 6 feet 6 inches an essential condition of its arrangement being that it is kept as free from the immediate vicinity of iron as the nature and equipment of the vessel will permit The details of all the essential parts of the Admiralty Standard compass including  A brief description of this compass and the chief points in its construction is appended IDCCCLX 2 ZMR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS the cards and needles are uniform throughout the intensities of the latter being remarkably so and also permanent over long periods of time the observations made with this compass are therefore strictly comparable and it will be understood that the results given in this Report except when specified to the contrary and the inferences arising therefrom must be considered as applying to a compass in the various details of position and structure just described The analysis of the deviations of the compass in ironbuilt vessels embraces fortytwo ships of the Royal Navy and including the woodbuilt screw and paddlewheel steam vessels as also the deviations observed in various parts of the steam ship  Great Eastern during her experimental trip to Portland in the autumn of 1859 has involved a com putation of nearly two hundred and fifty Tables In order to render the analysis complete as a standard of reference there is appended certain statistical information relating to each vessel including tonnage and exact posi tion and height of standard compass these details will be found necessary in a critical examination of the magnetic characteristics of ships in general In the analysis of the Deviation Tables I have employed Mr ARCHIBALD SMITHS formula for computing the magnetic coefficients as deduced from PoIssoNs General Equations given in the Supplement to the Practical Rules for ascertaining and applying the Deviations of the Compass caused by the Iron in a Ship furnished to Her Majestys Ships and also in the Philosophical Transactions for 1846 In this formula the deviation  of the compass on board ship reckoned positive when the north point of the needle deviates to the east is given by the following expression AB sin gC cos D sin 2E cos 2 A D E being constants depending only on the amount quality and arrangement or position of the iron in the ship B and C depending on these and also on the magnetic dip and horizontal intensity anlld the azimuth by disturbed compass of the ships head reckoned from the magnetic north to the east This formula is only approximate but is sufficiently correct when the deviation does not exceed about 20 The accurate formula involves calculations too laborious to be applied to ordinary cases Without entering on the nature and action of the magnetic forces which cause the deviation of the compass on board shipto be found in the works to which I have alluded as also in the introduction to Dr SCORESBYS late Voyage round the World for magnetical research edited by Mr ARCHIBALD SMITHfurther than to attach a physical meaning to the coefficients for practical elucidation it is necessary to premise that the investigations of the Astronomer Royal are in accord with the general terms   Account of Experiments on Ironbuilt ships instituted for the purpose of discovering a correction for the deviation of the

facilitating the examination of Compass Deviations by G B AIYn Esq Astronomer Royal Philosophical Transactions for 1856 338IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY of this formula observing that in those investigations the coefficients A and E are eliminated by the assumption that the soft iron is symmetrically distributed on each side of the foreandaft line of the ship The meaning of the several coefficients is as follows A is a constant deviation real or apparent  if easterly deviation is in excess  if westerly when real it arises from the induction of the horizontal force of the earth on masses of soft iron unsymmetrically distributed when only apparent as in nearly every case recorded it is considered due to prism or index error of the compass on board or of the compass employed on shore in obtaining reciprocal bearings as also local disturbance of the latter and when the deviation has been observed by the bear ing of a distant object that the latter has been imperfectly determined B and C are due to the combined effects of the permanent magnetism of the hard iron the deviation produced by which varies inversely as the horizontal force at the place and that induced by the vertical part of the earths force on the soft iron in the ship the deviation produced by which varies as the tangent of the dip This deviation has been termed polarmagnet by the Astronomer Royal and semicircular by Mr A SMITH from the nature and appearance of the curve when graphically delineated B represents that part of the combined attraction acting in a foreandaft direction  if before the compass  if abaft it that is the north end of the needle is attracted to the bow in the former case and to the stern in the latter C is that portion of the combined attraction acting in an athwartship direction  if the north end ofr the needle is drawn to the starboard side  if drawn to the port side of the ship D and E known as the permanent coefficients from their theoretically considered unchanging value in all magnetic latitudes are due to the horizontal induction of the soft iron in the ship and produce a  quadrantal deviation the term multiplied by D having its four nmaxima at the intercardinal points and that by E at the cardinal points The values of D are considered by theory to arise from masses acting in a foreandwaft or transverse direction  from those before or abaft  from those on either side E is in general so small as to be practically unimportant Tables of Magnetic Elements of various Ships in Her Alajestys Navy Iron and Wood built The results of the analysis

steamship Great Eastern as observed in various parts of the vessel by myself conjointly with Mr RUNDELL the Secretary to the Liverpool Compass Committee The general tabular arrangement it is considered requires little further explanation than the titles of the various columns convey The column  Ships force to head  is the natural sine of the corresponding value of the coefficient B and is in fact the pro portion of the ships force to head to the earths horizontal force The column  Ships force to starboard  is the natural sine of the corresponding value of the coefficient C and is the proportion of the ships force to the starboard side to the earths horizontal force The resultant of B and C is the ships force and is in its direction tan1 and amount vB2C2 the equivalent of the  true starboard angle  measured from the bow round by the starboard side to the bow again or  neutral position and of the  modulus of polarmagnet deviation in Mr AIRYS paper in the Philosophical Transactions for 1856 It will be observed that in the results obtained from Deviations observed on Foreign stations noted in italics the total force of the ship is given in two lines the upper line being the proportion of the ships force to the horizontal force of the earth at the place the lower line being the proportion of the ships force to the horizontal force in England so as to allow a comparison to be made of the absolute force of the ship at various stations For convenience 1000 has been adopted to represent the value of the earths hori zontal magnetic force at the several English ports where Her Majestys ships are usually swung viz Greenhithe Sheerness Portsmouth and Plymouth for other stations I have adopted those given by Mr AIRY in the paper of 1855 alluded to and for several places not included in his discussion reference has been made to the chart of Absolute Mag netic Intensity by General SABINE  employing for the reduction to the horizontal com ponent the most recent determinations of the magnetic dip with which I am acquainted A comparative Table of the foregoing elements with the horizontal force as given by GAUSS in his Atlas des Erdmagnetismus reduced to the same unit of measure is appended as being probably of use in any future inquiry or discussion I now proceed to direct attention to various features exhibited in the several Tables  KEITH JOHNSONS  Physical Atlas 2nd edition 340IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY and shall venture to suggest what would appear from fair inferences to be the leading principles of the magnetism of the ships included therein and their practical applica tion It has been deemed unnecessary to introduce an analysis of the compass deviations of woodbuilt sailing vessels as whether as ships of war with batteries of guns or merchant vessels carrying cargoalways excepting irontheir deviations are small in amount and arising in the aggregate from induced magnetism An intercomparison of the magnetic coefficients of iron and woodbuilt steamships is of greater importance in the investigations of the laws affecting the former than would at first appear the special points elicited are That D which in the iron vessel ranges in value from 1 to 6 and 7 the Liver pool Compass Committee recording even a point or 11 seldom exceeds 1 in wood screwships with not unfrequently a small minus sign in these vessels and 12 in the wood paddlewheel steamships A and E appear common in character and value in all the classes of vessels enume rated B and C thus differIn the woodbuilt vessel in Great Britain B is  whenever the engines are before the compass and C is always small in value In the ironbuilt vessel B irrespective of the machinery is either  or  as the ships head while building was south or north and C may be large in value either  or  B nearly vanishing as the ships head while building deviated from the magnetic meridian and approached the east or west points of the compass Taking therefore the relative tonnage horsepower and position of the standard com pass in each class of vessel wood and iron a judgment can be formed of the comparative magnetic effects of the engines and boilers apart from the hull or hammered fabric of the iron ship Several examples occur in the Tables from which we may infer 1 that in an iron vessel built in England head south the north end of the needle is drawn to the bow or B is positive The steam machinery has the same effect B therefore as due to the hull is increased in amount 2 In an iron vessel built head to the north the north end of the needle is drawn to the stern or B is negative the steam machinery will in this case tend to diminish the value of this coefficient and on reference to Table I it will be observed that as a rule those vessels with B positive have taking size and other con ditions of compass position into consideration large compass deviations But what are the combined effects of steam machinery and hull on a great change of geographic position or in high south magnetic latitudes An examination of the several Tables elicits some valuable information on this important point  The connexion between the direction of the ships keel and head while building as referred to the mag netic meridian and the direction and strength of her magnetic polarity so fully experimented on by the late Dr Snd the r iverpool Compass Committee is I consider fully confirmed and there will be added to this Report the magnetic liines of the  Great Eastern as another example of this remarkable feature of an iron ships magnetism 341MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS Referring to the magnetic changes of the woodbzilt vessels screw or paddle in the progress of their respective voyages to and in the southern hemisphere of which there are several good continuous examples it is evident that the coefficients B and C are dependent in their change chiefly on the alteration of the magnetic dip and that the horizontal intensity is a minor element of disturbance it may therefore be inferred as a general rule that in steam machinery permanent magnetism bears but a small propor tion to inductive This appears sufficiently from examples in Tables III and IV as also that as in the case of woodbuilt sailing vessels discussed by General SABINE in the Philosophical Transactions for 1849  the wood steamships magnetism on rapid changes of geogra phic position falls short of or lags behind the amount theoretically due to changes of magnetic latitude The wood screwships Plumper and Highflyert are instructive examples of the  lagging behind of their magnetism in the former case on the ships arrival at Vancouver Island the semicircular deviation was much in arrear of the value due to the magnetic dip as compared with that originally obtained in England After an interval of sixteen months on the ship being reswung in the same locality which she had not quitted the deviations exceeded the original amount observed in England approximating to the value due to the increased magnetic dip at Vancouver Island Similar features are exhibited in the Highflyer employed in the China seas We have now to consider the magnetic nature of the hull of the iron vessel combined with the steam machinery and in stating here the fact of the former being in the ma jority of the vessels investigated highly permanent and but slightly inductive in contra distinction to the steam machinery I am only anticipating what will be hereafter given in proof from examples in Table I The position of the standard compass with reference to the steam machinery in an iron vessel has therefore an important bearing practically and theoretically for if it is placed in proximity to the funnel which may be considered as the zero or measuring point for the machinery in general the inductive magnetism of the machinery is super added on the subpermanent magnetism of the hull and complicates the question appa rently beyond research An instructive practical example of this condition is afforded in the case of the Vulcan iron ship in this vessel the steam machinery is further aft than is usual in ships either of the Navy or of the mercantile marine and it will be observed that the standard compass is only 27 feet distant from the funnel and is elevated on the poopdeck nearly to the level of the top of the latter Viewing the nature of the Vulcans hull under the conditions of permanent magnetism the maximum deviation or ships force Contributions to Terrestrial Magnetism Part IX t Commanded respectively by Captains GEOirGE H RIClHlDS and CHARES F SuADWELL CB The labour and attention bestowed by these officers in the determination of the compass deviations of their ships and the consequent value of the results to the practice of navigation and the theory of a ships magnetism are worthy of especial record 342IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY when at the Cape of Good Hope should have been reduced in the inverse proportion of 1000 to 14174 or about onesixth whereas by observation it had more than doubled the polarity of the funnel and machinery following the changes of magnetic dip the vessel was some months employed in high south magnetic latitudes was reversed and thus their force of magnetism B was added to that of the hull of the ship B also instead of being subtracted from it as had been the case in England The Simoom a nearly sister vessel to the Vulcan but with B and also observed at the Cape of Good Hope has the conditions reversed the semicircular deviation being smaller than its theoretical value for the opposite reason viz that the force of the machinery which had been added to that of the hull in England changing its sign was subtracted from it at the Cape of Good Hope On the Nature of the Magnetism in Ironbuilt Ships The magnetic influence of steam machinery having been reviewed the nature of the magnetism of ironbuilt ships can be entered on free to a certain extent of conditions arising from this extraneous source of compass error and those examples fairly elimi nated where it tends to embarrass the discussion The investigation of the coefficient D or the disturbance arising from the horizontal induction of the soft iron in the ship whenl extended over the numerous examples recorded in Table I offers several novel and suggestive points of inquiry the chief characteristics are 1 That it has invariably a positive sign causing an easterly deviation in the NE and SW quadrants and a westerly deviation in the SE and NW quadrants 2 That its amount does not appear to depend on the size or mass of the vessel or direction when building or on the iron beams 3 That a gradual decrease in amount has occurred when examined over a number of years in nearly every vessel that has been reviewed 4 That the value remains unchanged in sign and amount on changes of geographic position confirming theoretical deductions 5 That a value for this coefficient not exceeding 40 and ranging between that amount and 2 may be assumed to represent the average or normal amount in vessels of all sizes The following examples support these propositions 1 The value not depending on the size of the vessel Great Eastern of 22000 tons  4 8 Trident of 850 tons   3 26 Himalaya   3453   3 18 Oberon  649   3 23 Assistance   1820   3 36 Onyx  292   3 42 As also that the effect of iron beams which has been assumed as a large element of disturbance cannot be traced 343MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS Assistance    1820

wood beams   4 32 To establish the effect of iron beams more fully I carried out a series of experiments on board HMS Supply and from the results it is to be inferred that their magnetic character is identical with that of the hull of the ship being dependent as regards polarity and permanency of magnetism on the direction of the ship when building and the nature of the iron The uniformity of the quadrantal deviation of the compass when placed in various positions and at different heights from the deck is thus shown ft in o  In middle line of the Supply 28 feet from stern 5 0 high from deck 2

nishes the amount of quadrantal deviation as in mastcompasses but within the ordinary limits or from 2 to 6 feet from the deck the foregoing examples show that the value is not affected Another example was also afforded in HMS Assistance where the raising the standard compass from 4 feet 5 inches to 6 feet 4 inches above the iron beams which diminished the semicircular deviation from 17 40

floating battery MDCCCLX 345 3 AMR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS early days considered experimental and built of the best material had very small qua drantal deviations viz 1 and 10 6 respectively indeed the Astronomer Royal expe rienced difficulty in tracing the effects of terestrial induction Bearing these facts in view and taking further into consideration that in building Government vessels stringent conditions of contract as to soundness of material are enforced and strict supervision exercised it may be fairly assumed that the amount given of 2 to 4 repre sents the average condition of a wellbuilt ship of the best or superior iron On the other hand can the inference be drawn that an iron ship with large qua drantal deviation implies inferior material being used in her construction  Two of the most disastrous and fatal shipwrecks on record have occurred to iron built vessels whose magnetic characters are perfectly known HMS Birkenhead whose permanency of magnetism Table I was especially constant and quadrantal deviation small21 a short time prior to her lossmay be considered as the type magnetically of a hard ironbuilt ship the Royal Charter with a quadrantal devia tion of 6 and whose subpermanent magnetism fluctuated more than any vessel with whose records I am acquainted may be considered as the type magnetically of a soft ironbuilt ship It will be recollected that in the wreck of these vessels under their varied circumstances both parted amidships the Royal Charter so suddenly and rapidly as to invite serious attention to various points of her construction It is difficult to draw any comparative conclusions from these two cases but they are placed in juxtaposition as grounds for further inquiry as to the connexion between the amount of quadrantal deviation and the nature of the iron of the ship and it will be remarkable and not less useful if in the prosecution of such inquiry it can be esta blished that the relative qualities of the material used in iron shipbuilding can be discriminated by the subtle agency of the ships compassneedle On the Coefficients B and C in Ironbuilt Ships or that part of the Compassdisturbance arising from the permanent magnetism of  hard iron and that induced by the ver tical part of the earths force on the  soft iron in the ship On examination of Table I it is at once observed that in the majority of examples therein given a permanency of magnetism exists so little affected by changes of geographic position as materially to confirm the views entertained by the Astronomer Royal in his earliest discussion 1838 that the effect of transient induced magnetism in ironbuilt ships is very small comparatively The absence of irregular fluctuations and the gradual diminution of the ships force analogous to the gradual decrease of the quadrantal deviation are notable features and apparently the general permanency is but little influenced by concussions from the sea or from the repairs in dock which necessarily must have occurred during the several years over which the observations extend The gradual diminution of the ships magnetic force is shown in the following 346IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY 347 examples all determined in English ports and where it has been ascertained that from the compass remaining in the same position the results are comparative The column 4

of Her Majestys service at Sydney after a continuous service of three years in Australia 1853 to 1856 in high south magnetic latitudes in July 1856 she was chartered by the Colonial government of New South Wales to proceed to the northern coast of Australia to render assistance to an exploring expedition The officer who had previously been in command Lieut WM CHIMMO RN was the Government agent on this occasion and on the passage especially along the eastern shores of Australia that officer made numerous observations for the Variation of the Compass the direction of the ships head being noted to each which were transmitted to the Admiralty From these observations compared with the wellknown variation in these seas I was enabled graphically to construct a curve of deviation the results are given and are confirmatory of the general permanent nature of the ships magnetism under circumstances which I apprehend are novel aid not without value in a theoretical discussion The conclusions derived from a review of the foregoing results are not unimportant and not the least of these in practical value is that in an iron ship of ordinary dimen sions and of conditions similar to the examples quoted a standard compass can be placed the deviations of which will but little exceed those obtaining in woodbuilt steamships and further that on a change of geographic position however great these compass deviations will be within smaller limits and can be approximately predicted A divergence from these conditions will arise when the inductive magnetism of the hull or machinery predominates If we may judge from the case of the Royal Charter whose magnetic elements have been so ably discussed by various authorities large quadrantal deviation and fluctuating subpermanent magnetism due to hull alone are coexistent and give rise to conditions of compassdisturbance which are beyond prediction have hitherto baffled inquiry and given a complexion to theoretical deductions varying as regarded from different points of view Obser tions on the early changes of an Ironbuilt ships Magnetism illustrated by expe riments in the SteamShip Great Eastern The opinion has been long entertained that the original magnetism of an ironbuilt ship or that acquired in the process of building undergoes a rapid change after launching and that from this cause accidents have occurred to recently launched and hastily equipped vessels The records of ships of the Royal Navy do not illustrate this subject The unusual dimensions of the Great Eastern and the interest attaching to the pro gress and success of so great an undertaking pointed her out as a desirable ship to test in elucidation of various problems connected with the mariners compass and especially of the supposed early changes in the ships magnetic force Through the kindness of the Directors and partly in the nature of assistance sought for by that body from the Lords of the Admiralty I was enabled to make many 349MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS observations the results of which so far as they relate to the early changes in the devia tions of the compass and the external magnetic lines of the ship will be found in Table V and an accompanying diagram in Plate XV In the progress of building 18th August 1857 I ascertained by astronomical bear ings with the known variation of the compass at the time that the magnetic direction of her keel and head was S 29 50E A short time previous to the launching November 1857 I also obtained the few results for the external magnetic lines which will be found in the diagram After launching the Great Eastern was secured near Deptford dockyard with her head S 46 E magnetic differing only 16 from the original direction while building considerable works chiefly internally were in progress till the time of quitting this anchorage In August 1859 a few days prior to leaving the river an extended series of observations for the development of the external magnetic lines see diagram Plate XV was obtained which show that some alteration had taken place since the first approximate determination On September 7th 1859 the Great Eastern quitted Deptford on her preliminary trip to Portland arriving at the latter port on the 10th On the passage between these places which included temporary anchorages at Purfleet and the Nore every opportunity was embraced of determining the deviations of the compass at various selected stations in the ship which are marked in the diagram The deviations whilst in the River Thames were determined by noting the difference between the bearing of the ships head as astronomically determined by the use of a repeating card and prepared table of the suns bearings an as denoted by the compass a curve of deviations embracing each point of the compass was then graphically drawn through the general results At Portlandlying within the breakwater the correct magnetic bearing of St Albans HIead a distant point of land afforded ready means of determining the deviations as the vessel swung round at her anchor and subsequently at Holyhead where I proceeded again in conjuction with Mr RUNDELL similar means were adopted as at Portland by the bearing of a distant Welch mountain As it was not possible to swing the Great Eastern from her ponderous bulk in the mode usually adopted under these circumstances with ordinary sized vessels we were dependent on the changes of ships head arising from winds and tides this necessarily occupied much time and was the occasion of gaps being left in the curves of deviations obtained both at Portland and Holyhead which required to be arbitrarily filled up As these curves presented no anomalous differences from those of ordinary sized ships but were marked by perfect regularity and consistency among the observations these gaps were confidently com pleted From a consideration of the magnetic character of the Great Eastern it is apparent that the Admiralty Standard compass as also the ships Standard compass were placed in the best position with respect to the hull and machinery both for experimental research and the navigation of the ship indeed from the vast amount of machinery and neces 350IN THE IRON SHIPS OF TIE ROYAL NAVY sarily inductive material running nearly fore and aft the vessel I am disposed to attach but little comparative value to any of the results except those of the Admiralty Standard compass as it will be seen that the other compasses are influenced by the near proximity of steam funnels or iron masts Directing attention to the changes in the magnetism of the ship as indicated by this compass the gradual diminution of the ships force is marked at each successive period of observation and also the constant tendency to attain a foreandaft direction In the first five days from Deptford to Portland the force had diminished from 0X585 to 0480 nearly onefifth or the semicircular deviation decreased from 35 50 to 28 45 the direction of force or neutral points approaching a foreandaft line 10 or from 47 on the starboard bow to 37 it is here worthy of remark that the general direction of the ships head for three days at Portland out of the five named was NW or exactly opposite to her direction whilst lying at Deptford The change at the expiration of the next six weeks the ship in the interim having made the passage to Holyhead with some trifling rough weather still shows a diminu tion of force and tendency to the foreandaft direction of the neutral points of disturb ance the former is reduced from 0480 to 0390 or about onesixth the corresponding semicircular deviation being 28 45 and 23 0 and the latter changed 5 or from 37 to 32 The changes denoted by the mast and platform compasses do not follow the same progressive decrease and change of direction of ships force To the less perfect obser vations of the mastcompass arising from the difficulty of obtaining readings aloft and from the friction of blunted pivots after a few weeks wear and tear can be traced the probable causes for this instrument the unfavourable but unavoidable position for the platform compass has been adverted to The quadrantal deviations of all the compasses show a decrease so far confirmatory of the law that exists in the numerous vessels reviewed but there is an anomaly detected by Mr AIRY in the quadrantal disturbance of the Admiralty Standard compass worthy of record viz that it is larger in the quadrant from west to north the position opposite to that in which the ship was built 1st or 2nd 3rd 4th NE quadrant SE SW NW River Thames   4 33 2 40 4 8 6 6 Portland  4 38 3 8 4 53 6 37 Indication of rapid changes in the ships magnetism was also given by the ships esta blished standard compass which had been compensated on the passage down the river Thames from the known direction of the ships head by astronomical bearings and deemed by the gentlemen engaged for the purpose as correct At Portland with headt in the NW direction it had 7 error on the second day at that anchorage  Communicated in a letter to Mr RuNruDEL Secretary of the Liverpool Compass Committee 351MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS This error as also a smaller one considered to exist after the ships arrival at Holy head was as I understood eliminated prior to my visit at that port in the latter part of October but on then determining the deviations of the Admiralty Standard compass and referring the results to the ships compensated standard a residual error in the latter of nearly 5 still existed on some of its points Although the question of compensation is extraneous to the general tenor of this Re port I deem it of interest to record the above circumstances to correct a misapprehension as to the employment of long needles carried in the compasses of the Great Eastern to the extent of 11 inches for standard and steering and 16 inches for the mastcompass A series of experiments still in progress which I have instituted in elucidation of the comparative errors due to the use of long and short needles both where the disturbing cause is comparatively close to the compass as in the case of the rudderhead near the steering compass or the top sides and iron beams when heeling and in compensated compasses from the necessary proximity of bar magnets lead to the conclusion that no compassneedle should exceed in length for service in an iron ship 6 or 7 inches the card of course may be enlarged as practically convenient iThe errors of long needles under the conditions just named of proximity to perma nent magnetic bodies arise from this notable fact that their deviations assume the form not of a curve which is simply  semicircular as the curve is found to be which results from the ships general magnetic force when the length of the needle may be relatively considered as infinitesimally small but of a  sextantal superposed on a  semicircular curve the various maxima of the  sextantal curve increasing with the square of the length of the needle Assuming the zero of both curves the semicircular and sextantal to be at the magnetic North and South the maxima of the sextantal deviations by ships compass are respectively at about N 30 E East S 30 E S 30 W West N 300 W the points of coincidence with the semicircular curve being at North N 60 E S 60 E South S 60 W and N 60 W The tendency of the direction of the ships force in the Great Eastern is to assume a foreandaft line supporting the view that time with the vibrations and concussions due to seaservice leads to a settled distribution of the magnetic lines the respective sections of the hull which have north and south polarity being separated by lines ap proximating more nearly to a horizontal equatorial plane through the body of the ship instead of the inclined equatorial plane of separation due to the magnetic dip of the locality and divergence from the magnetic meridian of the hull while building A similar tendency of the direction of the ships force to approach a foreandaft line will be observed in several examples of Table I The example of the Great Eastern offers this practical information that prior to a newly built iron ship being sent to sea her head while being equipped should be secured in an opposite direction to that in which she was built and that the magnetic lines should be assisted to be  shaken down by the vibrations of the machinery in a short preparatory trip prior to the determination of her compass errors or their com 352IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY pensation but especially that on the early voyages vigilant supervision should be exercised in the determination of the compass disturbances Another important point which is generally neglected when compasses are adjusted by the aid of magnets in a newly built iron ship is rendered manifest from the circum stances just detailed namely the necessity of the errors of the compass arising from the iron in a ship being determined and placed on record prior to its adjustment Without the knowledge to be derived from these observations of the magnetic force of the ship or the local disturbing cause if such exists all future changes of magnetism and con sequent errors of the compass are the merest guesswork both to those who adjust and the authorities in charge of the navigation of the ship Any future legislation for the security of the navigation of our mercantile marine with reference to ironbuilt ships should secure the determination and record of these preliminary observations I have alluded to the importance of the conclusions to be derived from a review of the examples and cases given in this Report for although varying conditions of com pass disturbance exist and the inference is irresistible that they arise from the nature of the iron employed in the construction of the cohull of the ship there is no doubt that by attention to a few leading principles in the building and equipment of iron ships the larger and uncertain sources of error may be modified and reduced within limits both of fluctuation and amount that will not seriously compromise the safety of the ship in the hands of an ordinarily prudent seaman The points of practical import to which I would invite attention are 1st The best direction with reference to the magnetic meridian for the keel and head of an iron ship to be placed for building to ensure the least compass disturbance 2nd The best position and arrangement for a compass to ensure small deviations and permanency on changes of geographic position 3rd The changes to which the compass is liable from various causes when the foregoing conditions are fulfilled Before entering on these points I would refer to an appended series of diagrams Plate XVI illustrative of the polarity of the topsides and the coefficients B and C according to the direction of the build these diagrams forming the key to much that comes under review 1 On the best Direction for Building an Iron Ship In those built head NE East West and NW strong south polarity or an attractive force on the north end of the compass needle obtains on one side of the ship adjoining the compass as usually placed between the middle section and the stern the resulting disturbance is not lessened as the compass is moved in a foreandaft line within these limits In vessels built head SE and SW north polarity obtains under the same conditions MDCCCLX 3 B 353MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS In vessels built head North or South the conditions arise that in the former the attraction is toward the stern the topsides in their action being neutral to a compass in the middle line of the deck and diminishes in force as the compass is moved towards the bow In the latter the law is reversed and small compass deviations are obtained as the stern is approached In an iron sailing ship built head to South there will be an attraction of the north point of the compass to the head and if built head to North a like attraction to the ships stern and so far there would seem to be no advantage in one direction over the other But in the first case the topsides near the compass have weak magnetism in the second case they are strongly magnetic the first position seems therefore preferable In an iron steamship built head to the South the attraction due to machinery is added to that of the hull whereas in one built head to the North the attractive forces of hull and machinery are in the northern hemisphere antagonistic and a position of small or no  semicircular  deviation for the compass may generally be obtained To iron steamvessels engaged on the home or foreign trades in the northern hemisphere this direction of build is therefore to be preferred 2 On the Position and Arrangements for the Compass The position of compasses whether standard or steering must depend as will have been observed from the foregoing conclusions on the direction of the ships build that is in those built head North the compass must be as far removed from the stern as circumstances will permit in those built South placed as near to the stern as convenient without approaching so close to the rudderhead or iron taffrail as to cause the ships general magnetism to be overpowered by the magnetic influence of those masses In ships built East or West there is little choice of position except to avoid as a general rule proximity to vertical masses of iron in vessels built with their heads on the intercardinal points a position approximating to the bow or stern respectively where the action from the topsides to be determined experimentally is at a minimum is to be preferred Ample elevation above the deck and to be strictly confined to the middle line of the ship are the primary conditions of position for every compass in an iron ship and no compass whether steering or standard should be nearer the iron deck beams than 4 feet for the steering compass this arrangement could be met by the use of a vertical card for the helmsman The standard compass which as a rule I should recommend to be invariably uncom pensated requires an elevation of at least 5 or 6 feet from the deck and to be fitted on  A curious illustration of the effect of iron deck beams on long and short compassneedles resulted from some experiments made on board HMS Bloodhound on the deck or within a few inches of the position where not unfrequently hanging or telltale compasses are placed a 10inch needle had 43 a 6inch needle 38 and a 1inch needle 33 difference from their uniform deviation at 1 foot 9 inches from the deck 354IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY a separate and permanent pillar or stand it is by this superior elevation that the strong magnetic power of the iron beams and adjoining topsides are correspondingly lessened As every piece of iron not composing a part of and hammered in the fabrication of the hullsuch as the rudder funnel boilers and machinery tanks cooking galleys fastenings of deck houses care all of a magnetic character differing from the hull of a ship their proximity should be avoided and so far as possible the compass should be placed so that they may act as correctors of the general magnetism of the hull A compass placed out of the middle line of the deck is affected by the nearest top side and its deviations must necessarily be much increased if that topside has the domi nant polarity as in ships built East or West Experience has proved that the practical value of mast or elevated compasses has in some cases been overrated they are in fact affected by the ships magnetism to an amount depending on their elevation and the direction of the ships build thus in ships built North or South but especially the latterthe compass being on the mizen mast the deviations will be large comparatively In ships built East or West the deviations will be comparatively small from the topside which would affect a deck compass being more directly under the mastcompass they may therefore be useful in the latter cases and valueless in a ship built head to the South The wear and tear on the pivots and agate caps of mastcompasses from the increased motion due to their elevation require constant attention when they are employed 3 On various Sources of Error affecting a Compass placed under favourable conditions Errors arising from changes of geographic position as also incidental causes of error due to anomalous rather than general conditions have been brought under review in the general progress of this Report There is however one source of compasserror that arising from the heeling of the shipwhich has not been alluded to as the ship in all the points hitherto reviewed is assumed to be on an even keel The few experiments made in ships of the Royal Navy will be found in Table I and they tend to prove as also does the test of experience that when the original compass deviations are small the errors from heeling are generally small in proportion and conversely that exaggerated errors from heeling are the consequence of exaggerated errors while on an even keel Ample elevation from the deck in order to raise the compass above the level of the topsides and adjacent deck beams is one of the chief conditions for reducing this source of error The action of the topside nearest to the compass when the ship is heeled is well marked in the examples of the ships Bloodhound and Sharpshooter the former with B or head built to South and the latter with B or head built to North in the Bloodhound the north end of the needle is drawn to leeward in the Sharpshooter to windward In the iron sailingbrig Recruit with B the effect is the same as in the Bloodhound From the diagrams illustrative of the polarity of an iron ships topsides the action of 3B 2 355MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS the latter on the compass in heeling may be gathered and the corresponding effect shown under the various directions of the ships head in building thus With head built North on heeling the north end of compass needle will be attracted to the weather or nearest side from its south polarity NE   the same East   the same 5 SE5  the north end of needle will have but little error from the balanced conditions of north and south polarity of topsides 5 South  the north end of needle will be repelled to the lee side by the north polarity of nearest or weather top side  SW  the north end of needle will have but little error as at SE 5 West  the north end of needle will be attracted to the weather or nearest side  NW5 55 5 the same  These laws only hold good as long as the topsides in the immediate vicinity of the compass retain their dominant polarity due to their original direction of build in Great Britain if in south magnetic latitudes a change of polarity takes place the conditions of heeling correspond to such change The maximum disturbance on heeling in all these vessels is when their heads are by disturbed compass magnetic North or South and this disturbance vanishes when the head is East or West This law of disturbance may be thus explained when the vessels head is north or south on an even keel by disturbed compass the needle lies parallel to the topsides by their combined action which neutralizes each other on heeling the nearest topside exercises its then dominant polarity at right angles to the direction of the needle and hence the maximum error With the ships head east or west whether on an even keel or heeling either pole of the compassneedle points directly to the topsides and is consequently unaffected except in a vertical plane As the amount of disturbance on heeling varies under the various conditions of direc tion of build height of compass and breadth of ship or distance of topsides added to the prevailing permanent or inductive magnetic condition of the latter and the deck beams each ship must have an individual character to be determined only by experiment or observation at sea There are however strong grounds for inferring that by a  These principles have in their main features been confirmed by the experiments and investigations of the Secretary of the Liverpool Compass CommitteeMr RUNDELLto whom I am indebted for much valuable information on many questions of theoretical and practical value but their simple illustration by a consideration of the appended diagrams which so far as I am aware are novel in their application will probably be found instructive and useful to the practical seaman 356IN TIHE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY jndicious position of the compass so as to ensure small errors while on an even keel the errors arising from the ships heel will be so proportionally reduced as not practically to affect the navigation of the ship in the hands of a prudent seaman In concluding this Report which in some of its details will I trust be found to narrow the grounds of inquiry in this interesting branch of science so important in its practical relations to a maritime nation rapidly expanding its iron commercial navy I beg leave to record the material assistance I have derived from the researches of the Astronomer Royal and ARCHIBALD SMITH Esq on the subject of a ships magnetism Without their skilful analysis and mathematical demonstrations and much personal assistance rendered by the latter gentleman I could not have approached the subject and can therefore claim but little meritexcept that due to the labours of a lengthened computation and some practical experience and close observationin the elucidation of whatever principles may be received as sound in practice and as additions to science I have the honour to be Sir Your obedient Servant FREDK J EVANS Master RN To Captain WASHINGTON RN FRS Hydrographer to the Admiralty 357MR EVANS ON THE DEVIATION OF THE COMPASS APPENDIX No I The Admiralty Standard Compass The chief points in the construction of this instrument are the following 1 The bowl is constructed of stout copper with the view to calm the vibrations of the needle and the intersecting point of the axis of its gimbals is made to coincide with the point of suspension of the card and also with the centre of the azimuth circle 2 The azimuth circle is accurately graduated to minutes of arc and may be used in addition on shore for surveying purposes thus when accurate magnetic bearings are required the zero of the circle may be adjusted to the magnetic north shown by the card and then clamped any number of magnetic bearings may then be obtained round the circle or by adjusting the zero of the circle to any given object and clamping the compass to its stand the angles of objects round the horizon may be observed and read off to the nearest minute In observing Amplitudes and Azimuths the bearings are read from the card with out reference to the azimuth circle the card being graduated to 20 minutes 3 The magnetic needles employed are compound bars formed of laminae of that kind of steel clockspring which has been ascertained by numerous experiments to be capable of receiving the greatest magnetic power Each compass has two cards A and J the former is used at all times except in stormy weather with much motion in the ship when the heavy or J card is substituted Each card is fitted with four needles fixed vertically and equidistant on a light frame work of brass screwed to the card the pair of central needles are 73 inches long and the pair of external ones 53 inches the whole weight of the A card being 1525 grains  The pivots for the needles are pointed with  native alloy as being harder than steel and not subject to corrosion by exposure to the atmosphere the ruby cap of the card is worked to a form to suit these points 4 The impressions of the cards are taken after the paper has been cemented to the mica plate forming the basis distortions from shrinking are thus prevented and a more perfect centering attained Finally The cards and needles are adjusted to the magnetic meridian at the Com pass Observatory for Her Majestys Navy at Woolwich a place free from the local influence of iron The various adjustments for centering and the elimination of errors  In order that a vibration communicated to a card about a diameter intermediate between the N and S and the E and W diameters may not give rise to a  wabbling motion the moment of inertia of the card about these two diameters should be the same It was shown by Mr ARCHIBALD SMITH that this is the case with any two parallel needles of uniform thickness forming chords of the same circle if their extre mities are separated by 60 consequently with any four such needles if their extremities are separated by 30 and the needles of the Admiralty Standard compasses have been uniformly so arranged 358IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY 359 due to displacement of sightvanes and prism are also made at this observatory the compass being afterwards supplied

THE COMPASS SUPPLEMENT Added during the printing of the paper In June 1860 prior to the departure of the steamship Great Eastern on her first Atlantic voyage I was enabled through the attention and cooperation of the captain JOHN V HALL and managing director T BOLD Esq to institute further experiments on the changes of the ships magnetism under the same conditions as those already recorded as having been made in the River Thames at Portland and at Holyhead in September and October 1859 Subsequent to the observations made at Holyhead the Great Eastern rode out a violent gale in that harbourremarkable as causing the total wreck of the ship Royal Charter in the immediate neighbourhoodwhich necessarily subjected many parts of the hull to severe concussion from the strain on the cables the ships services were then confined to the passage to Southampton and during the sojourn at that port for the following seven months she quietly swung round the moorings to the tides and variable winds Extensive artificers works were latterly performed in the internal equipments These details are worthy of notice from the striking progressive diminution of the ships magnetic force and further tendency to the foreandaft direction of the neutral points of disturbance which the Southampton observations developed The same Admiralty standard compass having been placed in the exact position of former experiments the correct magnetic bearing of the extreme point of the Isle of Wight visible from the anchorage distant 12 miles was determined from a series of astronomical bearings and the known magnetic variation of the place the necessary correction for parallax due to the length of the ship being allowed for the successive points of the compass as the ship swung round From the wind prevailing in one direction for several days prior to the departure of the Great Eastern I was only able although engaged on the 13th 14th and 15th of June to obtain the deviations on sixteen and a half consecutive points namely from SSE by the South to NNW 2 W these deviations resulting from a curve drawn through fiftyone separate determinations made under highly favourable circumstances were as follows 376IN THE IRON SHIPS OF THE ROYAL NAVY Ships head by Stand comp SSE  S by E South  S byW  SSW  SW by S Deviation o   2 0E 0 20E  1 40W  3 40W  4 45W  5 30W Head by Stand comp SW  SW by

for the remaining points of the compass this appeared to be obtained with sufficient accuracy by trials of the coefficients B C D with various assumed values adopting those the deviations resulting from which should approximate most closely to the actual observed deviations on the sixteen and a half determined points The coefficients A and E were under the circumstances assumed as 0O 0 The resulting values for B of 13 30 010 40 D4 20 afforded a satisfactory approximation from whence the ships force in direction and amount are respectively 7 and 0235 the earths horizontal magnetic force being considered as at the other ports 1000 A recapitulation of the Great Easterns total magnetic force at each place of observa tion is herewith appended as also a Table of deviations which brings practically to view the change in the deviation of the mariners compass in a newly launched iron vessel amounting in this special case to a decrease of 12 on some points of the compass in the first five days 19 in seven weeks and nearly three points or 32 10 in the first nine months of service afloat September 7 River Thames  1012 Portland Oct 2224 Holyhead  June 1315 Southampton Angle of force

in the collieries but usually on the working face where there is insufficient dust to start an explosion In every case but one how ever the shots causing the explosions were fired where the miners were enlarging the main road way and where the dust had been quietly accu mulating for years The fresh air passing these points at the times of the explosions varied from twentythree thousand to sixtyone thousand cubic feet per minute so that any accumulation of fire damp was impossible Dust in the air may be ignited by an open light but not by a safety lamp One of the curious features of the dust explosions is that they exhibit but little force or violence near the point of origin but seem to re quire a distance of from fifty to one hundred yards in which to gain headway Once initiated the explosion is selfpropagating and rapidly in creases in violence the normal condition after an explosion is fairly established being 1 a wave of air preceding the explosion and filling the air in the roads with coaldust 2 flame following instantly into compressed air charged with dust Various popular ideas about explosions such as that they  face the wind or travel against the fresh air favor the coaldust theory Under the head of remedial measures the authors of the report note that wateiing the road ways which has been practised for many years as a mere matter of convenience is of little avail as a means of preventing explosions since the upper dust in eyery instance is left undisturbed Gunpowder should not be used in dusty places without first thoroughly dampening the dust The accumulation of dust in the roads may be diminished by reducing the velocity of the air which can be done by enlarging or doubling the roads by reducing the speed of the coalcars or by wetting or covering the loaded cars Exten sive dustexplosions could be prevented by keeping occasional sections of the roads thoroughly wet Since the dryness of the mines is due mainly to their high temperatures a large volume of air en tering at 400 and raised in its course to 70 ex ercising an enormous drying power the following more drastic remedy is also suggested to raise the air entering the mine to the temperature of the mine and saturate it with moisture It could then exercise no drying power and the natural moisture of the mine would come into play changing dry mines to damp mines The princi pal objections to this plan are the expense and the greater discomfort to the miners of working in warm moist air A more recent contribution in the Proceedings of the Yorkshire geologic and polytechnic society for 1886 recognizes the great importance of coal dust in colliery explosions and shows that con trary to the generally accepted theory important explosions are much more likely to occur when the barometer is high than when it is low The explanation is that while a high or rising barom eter tends to prevent the escape of gas from the coal it is also usually accompanied by a dry at mosphere which renders the coaldust lighter and more inflammable ELECTRIC RAILROADS IN TIS COUNTRY AN interesting article on electric railroads in the United States by T C Martin appeared in a recent issue of the Railroad gazette The progress already made in the application of electric energy as a motive power for streetrailroads as reviewed in Mr Martins article cannot fail to be encourag ing to all engaged in the development and exploi tation of inventions in that particular field of in dustry Nor is it without interest to scientific men and the public generally One electric road in Baltimore equipped by the Daft company has been in successful and profitable operation about two years A road in Los Angeles Cal built by the same company has been running several months and is soon to be extended to nearly double its present length This company is also constructing and equipping electric railroads in Pittsburgh Penn and Orange NJ and will construct others at Mansfield O and Ithaca NY The Van Depoele company of Chicago is able to show a good record in the matter of electric railroad construction Roads using its system of electric propulsion are running at Port Huron and Detroit Mich Appleton Wis Windsor Ont  Scranton Penn and Montgomery Ala which lastnamed city has eleven miles of road in operation This company is now constructing roads at Lima O and Binghamton NY In Denver Col there is an electric road con structed on what is known as the ShortNesmith system in which the current conductor runs in an underground tube contact being effected through a fiveeighths inch slot between the rails This road crosses eight horsecar tracks five steamcar tracks and a twohundredfoot bridge A threemile road in Detroit uses the Fisher system of equipment and a short line in Pitts burgh is being equipped on the same system A ninemile section of road in San Diego Cal in tended for high speed will be constructed by a company which has just completed a doubletrack road in Kansas City These two are overhead conductor roads A Philadelphia company which 431432 s COIE has already constructed a short line in that city is at present busy on the construction of mining roads one of these now under way being six thousand feet long and wholly in the mine The Sprague company of this city has completed a short road for a Boston sugarrefinery and is now making estimates for streetlines in several of our larger cities This company has made a series of tests with storagebatteries for streetcar pur poses which have given very satisfactory results A crosstown line in this city is to be equipped with the BentleyKnight conduit system  a sys tem specially devised to meet the requirements of streetcar traffic in crowded city streets A road in Allegheny City Penn is contracted for by the BentleyKnight company On the Eighth Avenue road in this city and also on a road in St Louis the Julian storagebattery system has been tried and it is claimed with results showing economic features as compared with horsetraction After referring to the many systems still in the purely experimental stage Mr Martin concludes as follows I At Ansonia Conn an electric road three and a half miles long from Derby to Bir mingham and Ansonia using overhead wire has been contracted for It will be used for both freight and passengers and power to drive the dynamo will be taken from the Housatonic dam At Newton Mass a road is to be built by a com pany already formed one is proposed for Worces ter Mass At Brookline Mass two will soon be in operation and one each is in view at Bangor and Biddeford Me Two roads are contemplated in Brooklyn one at Coney Island and one at Rockaway Pelham Park NY is to have a road this summer and Asbury Park NJ is adver tising for bids on another Franchises are asked for a road in Jersey City and Bayonne and Plain field NJ is also wanting a road In Pennsyl vania Scranton with one successful road is to have another and probably two A road is to be built from Carbondale to Jermyn four miles In Reading the Perkiomen A enue company pro poses to adopt electricity Harrisburg is to have a road and it looks as though before the end of the year Pittsburgh will have half a dozen Down south steps have been taken to construct new electric roads or adopt the system on old roads in Jacksonville Fla  Pensacola Fla  Bir mingham Ala Selma Ala Atlanta Ga and Fort Smith Ark Among roads spoken of in Ohio are several at Cincinnati Cleveland Tiffin and other places Wichita Kan is proposing to adopt electricity for its streetcars Lincoln Neb has formed a company to operate an electric rail way from the business part of the town to the stockyards In San Francisco a road is to be YCE VOL LX No 222 built on Fillmore Street hill and roads are also wanted at San Jose and Riverside San Bernardino county If I were at liberty to do so I could add to the above list about fifty names of places where from present indications and movements it is safe to say that electric roads will be running within a year EXPLORATION AND TRAVEL Sierra Leone WE give elsewhere a brief sketch of the tribes of Sierra Leone Our knowledge of this country is principally due to the commercial companies which are established on the coast and to the en deavors of the English and French to extend their colonies towards the interior We find some very interesting notes on Sierra Leone in letters by Lieutenant Mathews which were published in 1791 and his descriptions of the people are still true though a long time has elapsed and the slave trade was long since abolished The first to enter the interior was Major Laing who in 1822 succeeded in reaching the sources of the Scarcies and Rockelle the principal rivers of the colony R Caillie on his journey from the Senegal to the Joliba the upper Niger and Timbuktu and thence through the Sahara to Morocco 182428 crossed the territory of the Mandingos and gave an interesting description of their customs and mode of life In 1842 W C Thomson explored the district north of the Scarcies River and FutaJalon where the Scarcies Gambia and many tributa ries of the Senegal and Niger have their sources In 1869 Winwood Reade who was sent out by the London geographical society explored the country between the Scarcies and Rockelle rivers and after having reached the town of Falaba Major Laings farthest point crossed the watershed and descended the Niger which he followed a long distance The latest important researches are those of E W Blyden who travelled in the Susu country north of the Scarcies in 1872 and of J Zweifel and M Moustier who were sent out by the French merchant Verminck for the purpose of discovering the source of the Niger 1879 They followed Reades route as far as Falaba and then turned south to the head waters of the Niger Most of these routes run parallel to the large rivers The tributaries which are crossed by these routes are little known and much work remains to be done before the geographical features of the country and the ethnological character of its in habitants will be tolerably well known The proposed French expeditions to the upper Niger will add considerably to our present knowl edge of the interior parts of this district Owing fY I I

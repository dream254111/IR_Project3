city of Baltimore Maryland had acquired by devise an interest in certain land in the state of Louisiana to be used for and only for the education of the public poor in an action by the city of Baltimore and its coowners to recover possession of said land the defendants claimed title in themselves by adverse possession for the statutory period as pre scribed by the law of Louisiana Held that the city of Baltimore was barred by the statute City of New Orleans et al v Salmen Brick  Lum ber Co La 1914 66 So 237 The interesting point suggested by the case and passed upon by the court is whether a statute of Louisiana exempting all public property owned by the state from taxation and the operation of the statute of limitations is applicable in favor of a sister state owning land within the territory of the former state The court in its first opinion decided the question in the affirmative The decision of this point is not supported by any direct au thority and the court attempts to justify its holding by analogy and implica tion i e that inasmuch as public property used for public purposes situated in one state and owned by a sister state is exempt from taxation then by necessary implication it is exempt also from the operation of the statute of limitations with reference to prescription etc Stoutz v Brown 5 Dill 445 Fed Cas I3505 extending the doctrine of People v Brooklyn Assessors III N Y 5o5 and Sumner County Comm v City of Wellington 66 Kan 590 On rehearing of the principal case however the court reversed itself on another ground holding that the property in question was not exempt from acquisition by prescription on the theory that the property in question was not public property devoted to a public use That this holding is sub ject to question see Nashville v Smith 86 Tenn 213 State Jersey City Water Comm v Gaffney 34 N J L 131 and Adm of Tulane Ed Fund v Board of Assessors 38 La Ann 292 which appear to be directly contra BANKRUPTCYALLOWANCE TO WIDOW AND CHILDRENThe right of the widow and children of a deceased bankrupt under  8 of the Bankruptcy Act of 1898 to any allowance which upon his death they were entitled to from his estate under the laws of the state of his residence held not to be lost because the title to the bankrupt estate had vested in the trustee in bank ruptcy under  70 of the bankruptcy act prior to the death of the bankrupt but the assets remaining in the hands of the trustee at the bankrupts death are chargeable with the payment of such allowance Hull v Hicks 35 Sup Ct 152 Defendants counsel contended that  8 of the bankruptcy act does not create a right but merely preserves the right given by the state law to have a years support out of the estate left by the husband and father and thatMICHIGAN LAW REVIEW since the title to the property left by the deceased had vested in a trustee the decedent did not die leaving an estate upon whidh the provision for the widow and orphans might operate The court on the other hand insisted that a liberal interpretation was justified by the broad and comprehensive phraseology of the federal statute and the total lack of words of limitation to be found therein While it is true  70 of the bankruptcy act vested title in the trustee primarily for the benefit of the creditors and there was no exception in favor of the bankrupt himself yet the trustees title was sub ject to the condition that if the bankrupt died during the pendency of the proceedings the allowance for the widow and children was to be made from his estate in accordance with the state statutory provisions Tacking the proviso in  8 to legislation on abatement of proceedings makes clear that the Congressional intention was to make the preservation of such right to the bankrupts dependents as broad as the prohibition against the lapse in the proceeding The right accrued at the date of the bankrupts death and could only be enforced out of the property of the estate not disposed of by the court in the lifetime of the bankrupt since such transfers by the court were as binding upon him as a voluntary conveyance by himself or his duly authorized agent and could not be set aside for the widows benefit The dissenting opinion of Judge ADAMS in In Re MlcKenzie 73 C C A 483 142 Fed 384 on this same point is thus supported in preference to the majority opinion based upon a stricter construction and hereby overruled As to the widows right to dower the case In Re Angier Fed Cas No 388 under Act of 1867 which contained no express provision as to dower decided that proceedings in bankruptcy do not divest the bankrupts wife of her dower interest in his property and that an assignee cannot convey a valid title where no provision has been made for the dower rights To the same effect is Porter v Lazear Io9 U S 84 1883 where it is denied that a wifes dower is a part of a husbands estate or in any manner affected by the bank ruptcy proceedings Accord In Re Hest Fed Cas No 6437 also under Act of I867 Under the Bankruptcy Act of I898 In Re Forbes 7 Am Bank Rep 42 decided that while this act does not expressly make provision for the wifes inchoate right of dower it may be fairly inferred that she is entitled to it Thomas v Woods 173 Fed 585 seems to go the length of saying that Congress has no power to terminate dower rights existing under state laws

order by a third party to the young lady Later he married this lady and she turned over the notes to him to be used as collateral security for a loan Held the subsequent marriage did not destroy the

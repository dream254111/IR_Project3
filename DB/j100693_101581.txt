1670 IN 4O THIS AUTHOR NOT THINKING FIT TO GIVE US HIS NAME TAKETH NO SMALL PAINS TO EXPLAIN IN THIS HIS BOOK THE GENESIS OF THE WORLD AS TIS DELIVERED BY MOSES ESTEEMED BY HIM THE ONLY TRUE PHILOSOPHER IN DOING WHICH HE YET PROFESSES THAT HE DISSENTS NOT FROM THE PAGAN PHI LOSOPHY OUT OF A SPIRIT OF CONTRADICTION OR TO FLATTER CHRISTIANITY BUT RETAINS WHATEVER OF TRUTH HE HATH FOUND THEREIN AND ALL THE AIDS OF THE SAME WHETHER THEY BE PLATONICAL SPECULATIONS PERIPATETICAL RATIOCINA TIONS OR EPICUREAN SENSATIONS AND EVEN SCEPTICAL CAUTION IT SELF AF FIRMING THAT HE IS DOGMATICAL ONLY IN SUCH POSITIONS AS HE PROVES BY THE CONCURRENCE OF DIVINE AUTHORITY HUMAN ARGUMENT AND SENSIBLE EXPE RIMENT IN HIS PREFACE HE SEEMS NOT TO BE A LITTLE DISPLEASED TO HEAR SOME CHRISTI AN PHILOSOPHERS AFFIRM THAT THE VERY ESSENCES AND FORMALITIES OF ALL ELE MENTARY VEGETATIVE AND SENSITIVE NATURES ARE ONLY MATTER AND MOTION IN THE BODY OF THE BOOK HE ENDEAVORS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE WORLD HAD A BEGINNING AND LABORS TO DISPROVE THE POSSIBILITY OF THE WORLDS BE ING AB AETERNO THEN HE ATTEMPTS TO GIVE US FROM THE FIRST CHAPTER OF GENESIS A BODY OF NATURAL PHILOSOPHY DISCOURSING OF THE CHAOS THE FOUR ELEMENTS QUANTITY NUMBER TIME EXTENSION FIGURE POROSITY DENSITY RARI TY GRAVITY LEVITY REST MOTION PLACE SPACE AND VACUITY WHICH LAST HE REJECTS SHEWING HIMSELF WITHAL A GREAT FRIEND TO MOTION OF UNI ON FURTHER OF GENERATION AND CORRUPTION AND THE PROCESSE THEREOF TOGETHER WITH A SCALE AND ORDER OF ALL GENERABLE AND CORRUPTIBLE NA TURES THEN HE PROCEEDS TO TREAT OF HEAT LIGHT COLOURS THE AIR AND ITS ELASTICITY WHERE HE EXAMINES THE TORRICELLIAN EXPERIMENT NOT AD MITTING THAT TO BE AN INSTANCE OF VACUITY BUT ESTEEMING THAT A GREAT FORCE OF INTROSUCTION SO HE CALLS IT MAKES TEMPORARY PORES AND PERVIOUS PASSAGES BY WHICH THE AIR PASSES THROUGH THE BODY OF MERCURY IT SELF IN TO THE TUBE AND THEREBY IS SO VERY MUCH EXPANDED AFTER THIS HE CONSIDERS COLD SOUND METEORS WATER ODORS SAPORS THE FLUX AND REFLUX OF WATERS PRESENTING WITHAL HIS HYPOTHESIS OF TYDES AND ASSIGNING CERTAIN CRITERIA TO TRY ITS TRUTH BY WHICH DONE HE GOES ON TO TREAT OF THE EARTH AND OF WHAT IS CONTAINED IN THE BOWELS THEREOF HANDLING ALSO OF DRINESS CONSISTENCE MAGNETISME AND ELE CTRICITY FURTHER HE SHEWS HIMSELF A GREAT FAVORER TO THE REST OF THE EARTH AND HAVING TAKEN GREAT PAINS TO ASSORT THE SAME HOW SUCCESSFULLY GOOD1084 GOOD ASTRONOMERS MAY JUDGE HE PASSES ON TO DISCOURSE OF VEGETABLES THEN OF THE CELESTIAL BODIES AND AMONG THEM OF COMETS WHICH HE SUP POSETH TO BE MADE UP OF THE AETHEREAL EFFLUVIA OF THE LUMINARIES OR THE CONFLUVIA OF THE AETHEREAL MATTER AS AEREAL METEORS ARE MADE OF VAPORS FURTHER HE DISCOURSES OF THE FORMATION OF FISHES AND FOWLS THEN OF SENSATION IMAGINATION APPETITE BEASTS MAN HUMAN BODY HUMAN BODY HUMAN SPIRIT THE IMAGE OF GOD IN MAN AND THE IMMORTALITY OF THE HUMAN SOUL WHERE HE REPRESENTS MAN AS THE CENTRICK ORBE OF THE WHOLE WORLD MAKING HIM THE ABSTRACT THEREOF AND THAT ONE NA TURE WHICH ALL OTHER CREATURES DO CIRCUMFERENTIALLY RESPECT RELATING TO HIM ONE WAY OR ANOTHER AS SO MANY LINES IN A CIRCLE TO THE CENTER IN THE CLOSE HE OBSERVES TWO THINGS 1 THE SYMMETRICAL AND UNIFORM CHOROGRAPHY OF THE WHOLE MASSE OF MATTER AND OF THE SEVERAL PARTS THEREOF EXACTLY ADJUSTED ACCORDING TO THE MORE OR LESS DENSITY OF THEIR MATTER AND THE MORE OR LESS ACTIVITY OF THEIR QUALITIES VIZ THE SUPERAETHER AS HE TERMS IT OR THE UTMOST CIR CUMFERENCE OF THE WORLD AND WITHIN THAT THE AETHER AND WITHIN THIS THE AIR AND WITHIN THEM ALL THE TERRAQUEOUS GLOBE AND INMOST CENTER THEREOF 2 THE EASIE COMPREHENSION OF THE AGE OF THE WORLD ACCORDING TO THE MOSAICAL CHRONOLOGY THERE BEING IN THAT NOT ABOVE 150 GENERATIONS BETWEEN US AND ADAM IN

LUGDUNI BATAVORUM 1669 IN 40 THIS VENETIAN PHILOSOPHER ACQUAINTS THE CURIOUS IN THIS BOOK WITH SOME OBSERVATIONS MADE BY HIMSELF IN TWO LATE EARTHQUAKES AND BY OTHERS ALSO IN THE LAST ABOUT RAGUSA WHENCE HE THINKS AN ARGUMENT MAY BE DRAWN TO CONFIRM AMONG OTHER PROOFS THE DIURNAL MOTION OF THE EARTH HIS OBSERVATIONS ARE THAT IN THOSE EARTHQUAKES HIMSELF DID FIND BE SIDES A SUBSULTING PERPENDICULAR MOTION FOUND BY OTHERS A CONCOMITANT LATERAL ONE FROM WEST TO EAST WHICH LATTER HE CONCEIVES WAS NOT CAU SED BY THE FORMER WHICH HE ALSO ENDEAVORS TO PROVE BUT ONLY DISCOVERED BY IT JUST AS THE PROGRESSIVE MOTION OF A BOAT CARRIED WITH A STILL STREAM IS1085 IS NOT PRODUCED BUT ONLY MADE SENSIBLE FROM AN ACCIDENTAL CHECK TO A PERSON THAT SHALL HAVE BEEN PUT IN IT ASLEEP WHEN IT WAS AT REST BUT AWAKENS AFTER IT WAS MADE TO SWIM DOWN A STILL RIVER WHO WILL THINK HIMSELF UNMOVED TILL THE BOAT MEET WITH SOME STOP WHEREBY FOR THE TIME ITS COURSE WILL EITHER BE HINDRED OR DISTURBED AND HE MADE SENSIBLE OF HIS BEING IN MOTION HE ALLEDGES DIVERS OTHER OBSERVATIONS MADE OF RVIERS SUSPENDED BELLS AND CHURCHLAMPS WHICH WERE ALL OBSERVED BY HIMSELF AND MANY OTHERS TO HAVE LIKE WISE THE SAID LATERAL AND VIBRATING MOTION WHEREUPON HE ADMONISHETH HIS READERS THAT THEY WOULD ON THE LIKE OCCASIONS TAKE VERY PARTICULAR NOTICE OF ALL THE SEVERAL MOTIONS IN EARTHQUAKES AND THEN CONSIDER WITH THEMSELVES WHETHER FROM SUCH OBSER VATIONS UNIVERSALLY MADE IMPORTING THAT THE EARTH IN EARTHQUAKES IS VIBRATED TO WARDS THE EAST AND THAT THAT VIBRATION CANNOT PROCEED FROM ITS SUCCUSSATION WHICH IS ONELY ABLE TO CAUSE A PERPENDICULAR MOTION IN THE TREMBLING EARTH IT MAY BE VALIDLY INFERRED THAT THE EARTH HATH A DIURNAL PROGRESSIVE MOTION FROM WEST TO EAST III QUAESTIO TRIPLEX DE ANNO

IS NOT CONTENTED WITH ARISTOTLE TO ENQUIRE WHY BITTER OR STRONGSENTED MEDICA MENTS AND PLANTS DO MOSTLY PURGE AND FRAGRANT ONES PROVOKE TO URINE NOR WITH GA LEN TO FIND OUT THEIR VERTUES BY THE COLOUR SMELL AND TASTE BUT PROCEEDS TO PAR TICULAR EXPERIMENTS AND EXAMINES ALSO HOW AND UPON WHAT ACCOUNT THE VERTUES OF PLANTS ARE DISCOVERABLE BY THE SMELL AND TASTE DESCENDING TO THE CONSIDERATION OF THE SEVERAL PARTICLES FIGURES AND PORES UPON WHICH THE DIVERSITY OF THOSE SENSATIONS DE PENDS AND SUPERADDING THE EXPERIMENTS OF SOBER CHYMISTS AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CARTESIAN PHILOSOPHY TO THOSE OF ARISTOTLE AND GALEN MEAN WHILE THE LEARNED BARTHOLIN COMMENDS VERY MUCH THE KNOWLEDGE AND USE OF SIMPLE NATIVE MEDICINS ESPECIALLY PREPARED OF DOMESTIQUE PLANTS AND DIRECTS TO SUCH AT HOME AS MAY

THAT THOUGH MUCH MAY BE THENCE COLLECTED YET EXPERIENCE IS THE CHIEF MASTER OF ALL WHERE HE DISDAINS NOT TO RECOMMEND EVEN TO GREAT PHY SICIANS1086 FICIANS THE USE OF SIMPLE MEDICINS MADE OF HERBS USED BY PLAIN COUNTREYMEN NUR SES FARRIERS C AFFIRMING THAT THE CHIEF OF THE ANTIENT PHYSICIANS AS CELSUS SCRIBONIUS MARCELLUS DIOSCORIDES AND OTHERS HAVE DONE SO HE TAKETH NOTICE FIRST THAT THE

NOT TAKE OFF SOBER MEN FROM CONSIDERING IT WE SHALL AT THE VERY FIRST TELL THEM THAT BY THIS AFFECTED WORD OF LAC LUNAE NOTHING ELSE IS MEANT HERE THAN FLORES ARGENTI OR A FINE WHITE POROUS AND FRIABLE EARTH INSIPID AND WITHOUT SCENT DIS SOLUBLE IN WATER AND TINGING IT WITH A MILKY COLOUR AND SOMETIMES RAISING A KIND OF EBULLITION IN IT FOUND COMMONLY IN SILVERMINES AND IN THEM SUBLIMED AND STICKING TO THE ROOFS OF THE ROCKY HILLS HAVING A DRYING AND ABSTERSIVE QUALITY AND THEREFORE GOOD A GAINST THE AFFLUX OF SHARP HUMORS IN ULCERATED PARTS SERVING ALSO FOR AN EXCELLENT CONSME TICK ALL WHICH PARTICULARS ARE AT LARGE DEDUCED AND DISCOURSED UPON BY THE AUTHOR WHO OBSERVETH FIRST THAT GESNER IN HIS BOOK OF FOSSILS TAKETH GOOD NOTICE OF THIS MINERAL EARTH AND AFFIRMS IT TO BE FOUND IN THE MOUNTAINS OF HELVETIA ESPECIALLY THAT WHICH IS CALLED MOUNT PILAT FROM WHOM HE THINKS THAT OTHERS AS BOETHIUS A BOOT OLAUS WORMIUS ALDROVANDUS CALCEOLARIUS AND OTHERS HAVE TAKEN THE HINT SECONDLY HE MAKETH THE MATTER OF THIS EARTH TO BE THE METALLICK VAPORS OF SILVER ORE BY SOME FERMENTATION RAISED AND SUBLIMED AND THEN CONDENSED THIRDLY HAVING COMMENDED ITS ABSTERSIVE AND COSMETIQUE QUALITY

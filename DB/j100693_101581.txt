1670 in 4o THis Author not thinking fit to give us his Name taketh no small pains to explain in this his Book the Genesis of the World as tis delivered by Moses esteemed by him the only true Philosopher In doing which he yet professes that he dissents not from the Pagan Phi losophy out of a Spirit of Contradiction or to flatter Christianity but retains whatever of truth he hath found therein and all the aids of the same whether they be Platonical Speculations Peripatetical Ratiocina tions or Epicurean Sensations and even Sceptical Caution it self af firming that he is Dogmatical only in such Positions as he proves by the concurrence of Divine Authority Human Argument and Sensible Expe riment In his Preface he seems not to be a little displeased to hear some Christi an Philosophers affirm that the very Essences and Formalities of all Ele mentary Vegetative and Sensitive Natures are only Matter and Motion In the Body of the Book he endeavors to demonstrate that the World had a Beginning and labors to disprove the possibility of the Worlds be ing ab aeterno Then he attempts to give us from the first Chapter of Genesis a Body of Natural Philosophy discoursing of the Chaos the Four Elements Quantity Number Time Extension Figure Porosity Density Rari ty Gravity Levity Rest Motion Place Space and Vacuity which last he rejects shewing himself withal a great friend to Motion of Uni on further of Generation and Corruption and the Processe thereof together with a Scale and Order of all Generable and Corruptible Na tures Then he proceeds to treat of Heat Light Colours the Air and its Elasticity where he examines the Torricellian Experiment not ad mitting that to be an Instance of Vacuity but esteeming that a great force of Introsuction so he calls it makes temporary pores and pervious passages by which the Air passes through the Body of Mercury it self in to the Tube and thereby is so very much expanded After this he considers Cold Sound Meteors Water Odors Sapors the Flux and Reflux of Waters presenting withal his Hypothesis of Tydes and assigning certain Criteria to try its truth by which done he goes on to treat of the Earth and of what is contained in the Bowels thereof handling also of Driness Consistence Magnetisme and Ele ctricity Further he shews himself a great Favorer to the Rest of the Earth and having taken great pains to assort the same how successfully good1084 good Astronomers may judge he passes on to discourse of Vegetables then of the Celestial Bodies and among them of Comets which he sup poseth to be made up of the AEthereal Effluvia of the Luminaries or the Confluvia of the AEthereal matter as Aereal Meteors are made of Vapors Further he discourses of the Formation of Fishes and Fowls then of Sensation Imagination Appetite Beasts Man Human Body Human Body Human Spirit the image of God in Man and the Immortality of the Human Soul where he represents Man as the Centrick Orbe of the whole World making him the Abstract thereof and that one Na ture which all other Creatures do circumferentially respect relating to him one way or another as so many lines in a Circle to the Center In the Close he observes two things 1 The Symmetrical and Uniform Chorography of the whole Masse of Matter and of the several parts thereof exactly adjusted according to the more or less Density of their Matter and the more or less Activity of their Qualities viz the Superaether as he terms it or the utmost Cir cumference of the World and within that the AEther and within this the Air and within them all the Terraqueous Globe and inmost Center thereof 2 The easie Comprehension of the Age of the World according to the Mosaical Chronology there being in that not above 150 Generations between Us and Adam in regard that that Sacred Writing enumerateth from Adam to Christ inclusively no more than 76 Generations and al lowing 4 Generations to every Century since the Nativity of Christ the Total will not exceed the number abovespecified II FRANC TRAVAGINI Super Observationibus a se fa ctis tempore ultimorum TerraeMotuum ac potissimum Ragusiani PHYSICA DIS QUISIT 10 seu GYRI TER RAE DIURNI INDICIUM Lugduni Batavorum 1669 in 40 THis Venetian Philosopher acquaints the Curious in this Book with some Observations made by himself in two late Earthquakes and by others also in the last about Ragusa whence he thinks an Argument may be drawn to confirm among other proofs the Diurnal Motion of the Earth His Observations are that in those Earthquakes himself did find be sides a subsulting perpendicular motion found by others a concomitant Lateral one from West to East which latter he conceives was not cau sed by the former which he also endeavors to prove but only discovered by it just as the progressive Motion of a Boat carried with a still stream is1085 is not produced but only made sensible from an accidental check to a person that shall have been put in it asleep when it was at rest but awakens after it was made to swim down a still River who will think himself unmoved till the Boat meet with some stop whereby for the time its course will either be hindred or disturbed and he made sensible of his being in motion He alledges divers other Observations made of Rviers suspended Bells and ChurchLamps which were all observed by himself and many others to have like wise the said lateral and vibrating motion Whereupon he admonisheth his Readers that they would on the like occasions take very particular notice of all the several motions in Earthquakes and then consider with themselves whether from such Obser vations universally made importing that the Earth in Earthquakes is vibrated to wards the East and that that Vibration cannot proceed from its succussation which is onely able to cause a perpendicular motion in the trembling Earth it may be validly inferred that the Earth hath a Diurnal Progressive Motion from West to East III QUAESTIO TRIPLEX De ANNO MENSE  DIE CHRISTI NATI BAPTISTATI  MORTHI Auth R P Michaele Seneschallo e S J Leodii 1670 in 40 THis Author undertaketh to prove in this Chronological Treatise not only the Year and Month but also the Day and Hour of the Nativity of Christ and of his Baptisme and Death In the doing of which he maketh diligent research of all Writers of Chronology in general and then examins prrticularly the Variety of their Opinions concerning the Subject under Consideration discovering much Industry and Learning in all these Inquiries IV HERMANNI GRUBE M D Commentarius de Modo SIM PLICIUM MEDICAMENTORUM FACULTATES cog noscendi Hafniae  Francosurti 1669 in 80 TO this Treatise is prefixed an Epistle of Doctor Thomas Bartholin concerning this very Book and Argument by which it appeareth that this Author is not contented with Aristotle to enquire Why bitter or strongsented Medica ments and Plants do mostly purge and fragrant ones provoke to urine nor with Ga len to find out their Vertues by the Colour Smell and Taste but proceeds to par ticular Experiments and examines also How and upon what account the Vertues of Plants are discoverable by the Smell and Taste descending to the consideration of the several Particles Figures and Pores upon which the diversity of those Sensations de pends and superadding the Experiments of sober Chymists and the Principles of the Cartesian Philosophy to those of Aristotle and Galen Mean while the Learned Bartholin commends very much the knowledge and use of simple Native Medicins especially prepared of Domestique Plants and directs to such at home as may perform the part of Exoticks VVh re he specifieth the use of European Dock instead of Rhubarb of Elder instead of Sena of Cumphry instead of Mechoacan of Iris instead of Jalap c For Pargatives he finds at home Green Barley the Powder of St Johns Wort c He taketh our Wallouts to be a Succe dancum to Natmegs the Root of Angelica to Costus Scordium or PennyRoyal to the Dictamne of Crete the Sap of Fire to Opobalsamum the Geranium Moschatum or sweet sented CranesBill to the Indian Musk c Having done this he maketh a Reflexion on the Indicstures taken from Plants by their Taste and observeth that though much may be thence collected yet Experience is the Chief Master of all where he disdains not to recommend even to great Phy sicians1086 ficians the use of simple Medicins made of Herbs used by plain Countreymen Nur ses Farriers c affirming that the chief of the Antient Physicians as Celsus scribonius Marcellus Dioscorides and others have done so He taketh notice First That the external likeness in some Plants is not to be alto gether despised affirming that from thence it was discovered that our Ashwood like to Guaiacum is conducive to the Lues Venerea and other Maligne Diseases Se condly That neither the outward Signature is to be totally neglected since the Antients thereby did first discover that Hypericum was good for wounds Pulmonaria for the Lungs Saxifraga for the Gravel Walnuts for the Distempers of the Head V Vhere he notes that these signes do not so much respect the parts of the Body as their Distemper He concludeth with observing that those Plants which afford Salts of the like Figure seem to evince a likeness in their Vertues Upon this accompt he compareth together Wormwood and Pellitory on the Wall Baulm and Fennel Licorish and Capillus Ve neris Rosemary and Bug Buglosse c The Treatise it self to which this Epistle is an Introduction is directed to Medical Practice and enlarged with divers useful Observations for the sake of young Physicians V D E L A C T E L U N AE Dissertatio Medica Johannis Danielis Majoris Ph  M D Kiloni 1667 in 4 THis Book came but very lately to our view And that the extravagant Name of its Subject may not take off sober men from considering it we shall at the very first tell them that by this affected word of Lac Lunae nothing else is meant here than Flores Argenti or a fine white porous and friable Earth insipid and without scent dis soluble in water and tinging it with a milky colour and sometimes raising a kind of ebullition in it found commonly in SilverMines and in them sublimed and sticking to the roofs of the rocky Hills having a drying and abstersive quality and therefore good a gainst the afflux of sharp humors in ulcerated parts serving also for an excellent consme tick All which particulars are at large deduced and discoursed upon by the Author who observeth first That Gesner in his Book of Fossils taketh good notice of this Mineral Earth and affirms it to be found in the Mountains of Helvetia especially that which is called Mount Pilat From whom he thinks that others as Boethius a Boot Olaus Wormius Aldrovandus Calceolarius and others have taken the hint Secondly He maketh the matter of this Earth to be the Metallick Vapors of Silver Ore by some fermentation raised and sublimed and then condensed Thirdly Having commended its Abstersive and Cosmetique quality he giveth this fol lowing Recipe Lact Lunae Drachm VII Laccae Virginian vel Florentin Drachm I Moschi optim gran II vei III Misc exacte fiat pulvis subtilis which Powder he saith when tis to be used for the face or hands may for more con veniency be moistened with some Essence of Benzoin Rosewater or Orange water whereby the skin shall acquire a natural and florid whiteness without any danger of mischief Fourthly Inquiring into the particular places of the Generation of this Earth he af firms it to be found as in the abovenamed Mountains of Helvetia so in the Mines of New Spain and about the Mexican Bay as also about Perusium in Italy in an Isle near Hamborough called Heilige Land belonging to the Duke of Holstein and in Silesia near Brusnitz

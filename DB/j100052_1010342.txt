ON THE PERIOD WHICH IT REPRESENTS AS BIOGRAPHY IT IS WELL ADAPTED TO THE ILLUMINATION OF THE LIFE AND ACTIVITY OF A GREAT MAN MR JOHN JAY CHAPMAN IS ALWAYS ENTERTAINING AND STIMULATING IN THE TREATMENT OF ANY TOPIC HE SELECTS PRACTICAL AGITATION 1 IS A SERIES OF BRILLIANT ESSAYS ON THE INFLUENCES OF PERSONALITY IN POLITICAL LIFE AND IN CURRENT LITERATURE ESPECIALLY OF THE NEWSPAPER TYPE WHILE MR CHAPMAN IS NOT A PESSIMIST HE IS USUALLY HYPERCRITICAL WITH NO REALIZATION OF THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF COMPROMISE IN THE WORLDS POLITICS HE ATTACKS EVERYTHING THAT DOES NOT CONFORM TO THE STRICTEST STANDARD OF STRAIGHTCUT REFORM AND DOGINTHEMANGER TACTICS IN ITS ACCOMPLISHMENT THE MASSES UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE SINCERITY AND NOTHING ELSE AND THIS MEANS THAT YOU CANNOT SPEAK TO ANY ONE ON THE STREET WITH WHOM YOU DO NOT THOROUGHLY AGREE ON EVERY QUESTION OF PUBLIC POLICY OTHERWISE YOUR ACT WILL BE MISCONSTRUED AND YOU WILL BE GUILTY OF INSINCERITY THAT A PHILOSOPHY OF THIS TYPE LENDS ITSELF TO TRENCHANT EXPRESSION ESPECIALLY IN THE HANDS OF MR CHAPMAN NO ONE WILL DENY BUT OF ITS PERMANENT VALUE AS AN EDUCATIONAL FORCE THERE MAY BE GRAVE DOUBTS  THE TRUSTS  IS THE TITLE

TRUST MUST DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC AND MUST MEET WITH THE COMPETITION OF SUBSTITUTES FOR TRUST PRODUCTS MOREOVER IT MUST PROVIDE AGAINST COMPETITION FROM OTHER PRODUCERS WHO ARE AT TRACTED TO THE FIELD OF INDUSTRY WHENEVER PRICES ARE FIXED AT SUCH A POINT AS TO BRING LARGE RETURNS IN PROFITS THIS DOUBLE COMPETITION MUST EVER KEEP THE TRUST ORGANIZATION WITHIN REASONABLE BOUNDS WITH REGARD TO PRICES

GREAT FORCE AND RELE VANCY WITH THE INCREASING FEELING THAT THE STATE SHOULD NOT ENFORCE THE DEATH PENALTY EVEN FOR AGGRAVATED CRIME DR MCKIMS PROPOSI TION IS SURE TO PROVE TOO RADICAL TO ACCOMPLISH GREAT RESULTS THERE ARE OTHER REMEDIES FOR CHECKING THE MULTIPLICATION OF THE DEFECTIVE AND CRIMINAL CLASSES WHICH DO NOT APPEAL TO SENTIMENTALISTS ANY MORE THAN DR MCKIMS AND ARE YET MORE LIKELY TO

VIDUAL CULTURE ARE THE TOPICS OF THESE ESSAYS THE FUNDAMENTAL THOUGHT RUNNING THROUGH THE BOOK IS THAT BOTH EGOISM AND ALTRUISM ARE CAPABLE OF CLASSIFICATION AND ARE FOUND IN A FEW WELL DEFINED STAGES OF INTENSITY IN ALL HUMAN BEINGS FURTHERMORE THAT BOTH EGOISM AND ALTRUISM ARE ESSENTIALLY RATIONAL MOTIVES ON THIS POINT IT WILL BE NOTED THAT THE AUTHOR TAKES ISSUE WITH MR KIDD THE PUR POSE OF THE VOLUME IS TO SHOW THE EXISTING PREPONDERANCE OF EGOISM IN THE SOCIAL CONDUCT OF INDIVIDUALS AND TO DISCUSS THE QUESTION OF HOW THE PREPONDERANCE MAY BE TURNED ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG IN FAVOR OF THE ALTRUISTIC FACTOR THE THEORY OF EVOLUTION IN ITS APPLICATION TO THE ORIGIN OF MAN IS A SUBJECT OF VERY GENERAL INTEREST MOST WRITERS NOWADAYS ASSUME THAT THEIR READERS ACCEPT THE

THROUGH THE INTERIOR OF EUROPE RATHER THAN ACROSS THE MEDITERRANEAN AT THE PRESENT TIME HOWEVER WE ARE IN THE MIDST OF A GREAT DEVELOPMENT OF SEA POWER WHICH IS EXTENDING TO ALL PROGRESSIVE NATIONS THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LAND AND THE SEA POWERS IN WORLD POLITICS IS RAPIDLY DYING OUT BECAUSE OF THE GREAT INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SEA POWERS AND BECAUSE ALL PROGRESSIVE PEOPLES ARE STEADILY PUSHING THEIR WAY TOWARD THE SEA  BUT IT LIES IN THE NATURE OF THE LAND THAT EVEN THE SLOWEST PROGRESS FINALLY BRINGS THE PEOPLE TO THE OCEAN AND NO PEOPLE WILL PERMANENTLY RENOUNCE THE ADVANTAGES OF SEA TRADE THEREFORE THAT STEADY PROGRESS OF THE INLAND PEOPLES TOWARD THE OCEAN WHICH IS FOUND IN THE NEGRO RACES IN AFRICA AS WELL AS THE MOST CULTIVATED PEOPLES OF EUROPE THIS TENDENCY IS HAVING A TWOFOLD RESULT FIRST THE ENORMOUS TERRI TORIAL EXPANSION OF THE MARITIME POWERS AND SECOND THE DESTRUCTION OF THE OLD BALANCE OF POWERS IN EUROPE ALTHOUGH THE PAMPHLET CONTAINS IDEAS WHICH THE AUTHOR

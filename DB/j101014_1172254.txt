Harvard University The proximity of the Caribbean region to the United States and the fact that it completes our zones of naval protection make it highly likely in fact almost certain that the influence of the United States in that region will be enlarged instead of reduced and that our policy will probably look toward the final incorporation of all those islands into our empire On its face this policy seems to accord with the usual trend of colonial expansion Our present area includes a north temperate belt and a south temperate belt but we have lacked a tropical area such as Great Britain and France and Italy enjoy Here it is at our doors The question however is larger than material benefit Expan sion of our territory and influence seems to be in the temper of the American people For weal or woe ever since 1898 we have been following that road The last three presidents have deliberately enlarged the influence of the United States in the Caribbean region It seems written in the book of fate that gradually the possession of those regions will pass from European to American hands by consent of the two groups of nations concerned When we face these probabilities we must also face the price that we shall have to pay for this Caribbean policy to which the administration has been committed for the last twenty years which has been sanctioned by repeated ratifications of treaties by the Senate against which there seems to be no organized opposition in the House of Representatives and which is not much condemned in the press In the first place we must deny ourselves the use of some very agreeable terms such as the twentyone American republics There are no longer twentyone because five of these socalled republics are dependencies of the United States Cuba is no more independent than Long Island The island of San Domingo with its two Negro republics is no more independent than the state of New York Nicaragua and Panama are only nominal republics and 1 At the afternoon session May 30 423CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS VOL VI I nominal sovereignties Every one of these five  powers  is as much a dependency of the United States subject to its ultimate will and not to the desires of the people of the country concerned as is Burmah or Hong Kong or British South Africa or the Cape Colony to the will of Great Britain There is no use deceiving ourselves with words If we are to have a Caribbean empire we must get it by destroying the republican independence of the powers concerned Professor Shepherd asserted that we might buy the islands and make them independent Are we beginning that course by destroying the independence of the islands that we have not bought In the second place we must make up our minds that if we ac quire these islands we shall eventually have practically to annex the whole of Central America Already we control the socalled republics of Panama and Nicaragua and we are in negotiation with Honduras and San Salvador in the same direction The whole group of the six Central American powers are in the same boat and if it is right and necessary for us to appropriate to our needs two of those countries it is clearly right and proper to complete the whole thing When this is done what about Mexico Present conditions create a terrible pressure upon the United States to make good the old saying of President Hayes that a Panama Canal is a part of the  coastline of the United States A Caribbean empire more than doubles the pressure for the annexation of Mexico a tendency which I personally seriously and devoutly reprehend Next we shall have to adapt the Monroe Doctrine to a new and perplexing situation We shall never forsake the Monroe Doctrine it is a vital principle because it fits with the circumstances of the modern world but so far as the Monroe Doctrine was ever intended to stay the conquest of Latin America so far as it stands in the way of intensifying our relations with our neighbors we must admit that it no longer applies if we are to establish a Caribbean empire Professor Shepherds reasoning that these neighboring regions naturally are outliers attached to the United States if good for the Caribbean is no less cogent to the Philippine Islands Both have close geographical relations to great naval and military powers our policy in the Caribbean if founded on a great geographical prin ciple gives equal rights to Japan and other Asiatic powers as to islands that lie in their neighborhood In the next place we have to reckon with that troublesome Declar ation of Independence which was so annoying in slavery times When we say at the present moment that we are at war for demo 424 232THE CARIBBEAN QUESTION cracy we mean that we are defending the principle that govern ments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed what we actually do by the extension of our empire however neces sary and inevitable it may be is not to apply that splendid principle but to create two different kinds of states We set up a variety of small dependencies hardly one of which we should be willing to admit as a state in our own nation If by any possibility Mexico were included a great Caribbean policy would keep in permanent subjection about twentyfive million people who must take their decisions from Washington We talk about treaties with Santo Domingo and Haiti and Nicaragua as though the people there had any real representation Those treaties are actually made with per sons who for the time being have arrogated to themselves the gov ernment of the little countries We do not reach the people with our negotiations we do not seek to reach them How can other Latin American neighbors look upon this process without feeling that we are declaring the AngloSaxons the ruling force of the earth and relegating the Latin Americans to an inferior place Furtherand it is a point of great magnitudehow many people in this audience in case we should acquire the whole Caribbean region would go down there to live and identify themselves with the region Not one You cannot make an integral part of the empire of the United States out of regions to which a few visitors traders what not go and stay for a short time and come back again That is not colonization It is what the British have done in India what the French have done in Annam and that is why their Asiatic colonies will eventually break down They are not genuine colonies they are simply benevolent despotisms We also can be benevolent The United States means well it has dealt well with Cuba and the Philippines When I was over there nine years ago I discovered they were carrying on a great big Sunday school and the only trouble was that the children do not want to go to school Whatever we do in the Caribbean we must make up our mind to one fact in our relations to the twentyfive millions of people in that part of America There is not one of those nations that would not rather be misgoverned by its own people than well governed by the United States of America MR CYRUS F WICKER New York It is difficult within the limited time to choose specific subjects from the great number of interesting points that have been presented to us this morning We who have 425 No 2 233CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS VOL VII followed the addresses of this meeting must realize as perhaps never before the vast importance of the political and economic relations of our nation with the countries bordering upon the Caribbean Our relations with those countries are no longer academic they are very real and vital As we are speaking there is a living treaty a binding obligation or an active controversy going on with every one of them We have introduced an American protectorate in Haiti and there are American marines in Santo Domingo Porto Rico is an insular possession of the United States Cuba is our ally in the war and we have purchased the Danish West Indies With Colombia we have a longstanding and still unsettled controversy based on the acquisition of the Panama Canal which is the keystone of our Caribbean policy Finally turning northward we are a distant party to the controversy between Costa Rica Honduras Salvador and Nicaragua over a treaty which our country has just concluded with the latter in respect to a second interoceanic canal All of the problems relating to these countries come to me with a very peculiar emphasis and in many instances relate to personal experience These are the countries where I have lived and from which I have just returned after four years of diplomatic service in Panama and more recently in Nicaragua Having lived in inti mate relations with both canal routes I feel inclined to lay a special emphasis in every question that confronts us in the Caribbean on the importance of transportation and trade routes for I believe that in the development of these avenues of commerce lies our most im portant field of relationships with the Caribbean countries A glance at the map will show the importance of Central America and the islands of the Caribbean as the future trade routes of the world It is almost certain that within a few years the great bulk of the trade between East and West must pass between or over several of these neighboring countries The Panama Canal has been built but experts believe that whether through failing water supply or lack of capacity to handle the enormous tonnage required it may within a few years prove inadequate We have always been looking for other routes and the best and only other possible route is that across Nicaragua Up to 1902 this route received a majority of the favorable reports of canal commissions it occupies a more advantageous position than Panama as to both location and climate being eight hundred miles nearer or three days sailing distance shorter between New York and San Francisco It will very probably be built by the United 426 234THE CARIBBEAN QUESTION States within the next thirty years Nicaragua controlling this route for the greater part of its length has the natural advantage of possessing a great lake in the interior one hundred and sixty miles long reaching to within only eighteen miles of the Pacific and con nected with the Atlantic Ocean by the broad and navigable river San Juan We negotiated for many years with Nicaragua for the right to build this canal during which time Nicaragua and her neighbors were frequently in conflict over the adjustment of their respective claims Finally at the close of a war in 1907 there was called on the initiative of the United States acting in cooperation with Mexico a peace conference to which delegates from all of the five states of Central America were invited which not only concluded terms of peace but also established a Central American Court of Justice to meet in perpetual session at Cartago in Costa Rica which court was authorized to hear and determine all causes of complaint between these states and under certain conditions between any one of them and an outside nation Shortly after this our treaty with Nicaragua was concluded following a revolution in which we intervened and established a government under which peace and order are main tained by the presence of American marines This treaty with Nicaragua known as the Nicaraguan Canal Treaty grants to the United States in return for the payment of three million dollars the exclusive right to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua It also grants to the United States the right to establish a naval base on the Nicaraguan shore of the Bay of Fonseca opposite Honduras and Salvador and the ownership of Great Corn and Little Corn Islands in the Caribbean Unfortunately immediately following the ratification of this treaty the Republic of Costa Rica brought suit in the Central American Court of Justice against Nicaragua on the ground that the latter had not respected Costa Rican rights in concluding and ratifying the canal treaty with the United States The court by a vote of four to one Nicaragua alone dissenting declared in favor of Costa Rica In the meantime Salvador also brought a suit against Nicaragua in the same court on the ground that her sovereign rights were affected by a treaty which would permit of the establishment by an outside power the United States of a naval base which al though on Nicaraguan territory would dominate the entire shore line of Salvador on Fonseca Bay and her principal seaport La Union Again the court held against Nicaragua and again Nicaragua re 427 No 2 235CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS VOL VII fused to abide by the decision The court is now threatened with dissolution on the ground that its authority has been disregarded and its prestige impaired Of course these canal rights are very valuable to the United States In fact Nicaragua is possibly more important to us than all of the other Central American states combined There is not the slightest doubt that the establishment of a United States naval base on Fonseca Bay would insure a greater measure of peace and commercial prosperity to all of the surrounding states Before an other controversy similar to that of Panama and Colombia has arisen I believe we should regard this important Central American situation from the point of view of an interest jointly with others in the rights desired that we should seek to uphold the authority of an honorable and important institution for the creation of which we stood sponsors before the world and that we should prevent the creation or con tinuance of an unnecessary controversy which it is well within our power to adjust by joint action with all of the countries involved This is but one of the problems that immediately confront our nation in its relations with the countries of the Caribbean As a nation we have had almost as many policies with regard to the coun tries adjacent to our shores as there are countries themselves Some of these policies we have drifted into and others have been the result of settled and directed purpose But we all feel that we can not look forward twentyfive years and expect to see the relations of our country to the nations surrounding the Caribbean remaining exactly the same as they are today Twentyfive years from now some new order of relationships is bound to exist and it is our privilege today to discuss what the nature of those policies may be and to set ourselves toward working them out Fortunately two such programs for a really national foreign policy with regard to the countries of the Caribbean have been outlined to us this morning One is to leave them alone to retire absolutely from active inter ference from their internal and external affairs They other is its opposite and has been urged with great ability namely that as the inevitable destiny of the United States we should acquire all of the neighboring territories purchasing from their European owners those which are dependent possibly in return for money loans to the nations now at war and binding the rest to us by treaty under an American hegemony Both programs have their advantages prob ably neither is attainable because under the pressure of the world war we are beginning to realize that as a factor in this worlds 428 236THE CARIBBEAN QUESTION destiny absolutism whether of nations or individuals must go In like manner the failure of the concert of Europe has shown that a carefully planned balance of power between nearly equal states is also unable to insure a lasting peace In the declaration of mankind against world domination by a single power or group of powers the United States has now taken its full and proper part on the side of a democracy of nations and there remains one hope growing stronger with each new expression of international understanding and cooperation that out of this conflict will arise a new order of international relationships based on international organization In such an organization we must see that small nations as well as great shall find opportunity for national expression and a full measure of protection The great nations will as before control the destinies of the world but more and more the need is apparent for some recognizable and satisfactory position for the small nations which will preserve their integrity and individuality but which would at the same time remove them as incentives to war among themselves or between their neighbors Such a position wholly outside of the realm of war is found only in a state of perpetual neutrality or neutralization Neutralization is yet a new idea scarcely more than a century old First applied by the Congress of Vienna in 1815 in the neutraliza tion of Switzerland it is today regarded without question as part of the public law of Europe It has been made to cover a multitude of objectsstates territories cities provinces islands and canals Four entire countries have been neutralized three of them independ ent states of Europe and one a union of dependent states in Africa Switzerland Belgium and Luxemburg Cracow Corfu and Paxo Savoy the Basin of the Congo and the Suez Canal have all been placed in more or less permanent neutrality A little known in stance has already occurred in America and among the countries of the Caribbean in the placing of Honduras in a state of absolute neutrality for the duration of a tenyear treaty in which position she is guaranteed by the action of the other Central American states Arising from the desire to separate hostile neighbors the early states to be neutralized were buffer states barriers liable to be traversed by the armies of both belligerents in time of war With the century however the doctrine has developed new and poten tially more effective powers in the furtherance of international peace Where once entire states were neutralized provinces and colonies may now be placed in a similar position and forever removed as the 429 No 2 237CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS VOL VII fruitful causes of war or occasions for armed peace Neutralization diminishes in effect the chances of war between states by removing the most envied territories and the most important strategic positions from the aims and ambitions of international aggressors To the smaller states neutralization under international organiza tion offers the promise and guarantee of integrity independence and the peaceful pursuit of national aspirations Neutralization creates in no sense a protectorateprotection implies security at the loss of both internal and external sovereigntybut the state placed in per manent neutrality loses no part whatever of its internal sovereignty and only so much of its external freedom of action as may by its exercise endanger the very continuance of its peaceful relations with its neighbors Neutralization is not an affair between guardian and ward but an international act an agreement of mutual obligation and understanding between fully sovereign states undertaken in the interest of them all Is such a condition possible a division of the world into two groups one of powerful nations guarantors and guardians of peace and the other embracing all the rest of the civilized world small states territories and colonies all confirmed by contract in perpetual peace It may not be attained at once but the idea is practicable and the growth of the principle of permanent neutrality has been steady and sure until through its means have arisen possibilities for friendlier world relationships undreamed of by early statesmen It may be contended that neutralization will not be maintained in the future that it will fail and the case of Belgium is cited The case of Beligum is not the failure of neutralization but a supreme example of its justification Power can not prevent a country from being invaded any more than a policeman can prevent an assault or a fireman can prevent a fire But resistance can be aided the in vasion can be turned back and swift punishment can be meted out to the invader The fact that England entered the war with all her power to relieve invaded Belgium and the stern conviction of a united world that this war will not be concluded until restitution has been accomplished reparation made and adequate punishment meted out to the invaders is the strongest possible security for the sanctity of neutralized territory for all time to come Neutralization is a remedy lying ready to our hands in removing not only the causes of war but also the intolerable burdens of armed peace There is no loss of honor to a state in accepting neutraliza tion and no occasion for shame in granting it to colonial possessions 430 238THE CARIBBEAN QUESTION Free and independent states may ask for and receive permanent neu trality as freely as did Switzerland a century ago and every state may have the opportunity of expressing its desire before one of the many international conferences now so frequently summoned in the furtherance of peace The part which may be played by the United States in the future of permanent neutrality is important but its possibilities are not restricted to our nation alone The countries of the Caribbean may propose it for one or all of the separate states and in so doing confirm before the world any principle of permanent neutrality to which they wholly give their support The result in the furtherance of international peace would be inestimable it is also within our power to achieve it The solution of these problems which properly lie within the realm of political relations and are worthy of the deepest consider ation is probably not at this time imperative I turn therefore very briefly to an immediate and vital subject not yet as I believe touched upon at this convention I refer to the problem of co operation in the survey conservation and distribution of that vast supply of unutilized food stuffs available in Latin America and would seek to discover how best we can call upon our Latin American neighbors particularly those lying in close geographical relation to our shores in meeting this problem by utilizing their abundance of lifesustaining food This nation is engaged in the most gigantic struggle the world has ever known wherein all resources are enlisted It is no longer a matter of army against army but of nation against nationwhere materials labor and wealth are all called on to insure victory for democracy Without cooperation not only within the nation but among the nations we cannot succeed The countries of Latin America have offered their military strength to the extent of their ability but we are facing a problem vaster and more vital still the problem of food supply When I speak of calling on the countries of the Caribbean to take stock of their resources and join with us in the production and proper conservation of food I would avoid the chances of misunderstanding or misinterpretation Speaking from a personal knowledge of the countries in which I have lived I know that Central America can not supply the foods which we commonly think of as necessities The countries of the Caribbean are importers of our natural food stuffs such as wheat and corn and beans and are suffering from lack of these at this time We cannot call on Central America and the 43I No 2 239CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS islands of the Caribbean to supply the Allies with the foods that they need but we can call on them to supply the world with the foods which they do grow and which they now throw away in amounts be yond all calculation A little capital a little organization and the constantly ripening new crops could be harvested and used I could speak of cocoanuts or of bananas thousands of bunches of which being perishable are thrown into the sea weekly because there are no ships to carry them Yet the banana has a food value nearly equal to that of wheat and an acre in bananas will produce twenty times the food quantity of an acre in cereals at a fraction of the cost There are also natural fruits that perish by the million bushels and could be fed to pigs all of which are lost through lack of organization It is not of the profits that I am speaking but of the food for which Europe is starving and which we in this country are making unprecedented efforts to supply The food is there and within a few days of our shores A survey and an efficient organization of the wasted food supplies of Nica ragua alone would feed our armies and leave an abundance for Europe The governments of the Central American countries are aware of their food resources but they can do nothing They lack capital credit and labor under our vague distrust of the stability of all things Latin American The stability of governments in the islands and shores of the Caribbean is under the existing treaties and policies of the United States much greater than is generally believed but apart from that there is a very real stability in the existence of food I suggest therefore that this conference most seriously consider the advisability of cooperation now by our government with the governments of the nations of all Latin America in the survey and conservation of the valuable food resources of the respective nations and if the results appear adequate that we as a nation offer the capital that may be needed to save from waste and utilize these food resources and at the same time supply the organization which in great part those countries have never known 432 240

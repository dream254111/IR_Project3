halftones being especially fine so that in this particular it is a desirable addi tion to the periodicalshelf of any botanical library Compared with the much older French journal Revue Bryologique the American publication makes a very good showing indeed and while perhaps not quite so technically scientific ours is quite the superior in illustrations printing and arrange ment of matter For this country our journal is much more useful than the French one THE BOTANISTS AT PITTSBURG IT is not too early for the botanists of the country to be planning for the Pittsburg meetings in and in connection with the Ameri can Association for the Advancement of Sci ence on June 30 and July 1 2 3 Coming so closely after the end of the college year this should find an unusually large number of botanists free to attend the meetings after which the practically unbroken vacation still lies before each one On many accounts this should be a large meeting of the botanists The place of meeting is within easy reach of both eastern and western botanists and the region is one which should offer many botan ical attractions quite out of the usual lines If the local botanists do their duty as doubt less they will there should be some interesting excursions and opportunities for the examina tion of recent and also of fossil vegetation Botany includes the vegetation of the past as well as that of the present and here will be an opportunity for studying the former which should not be allowed to pass unim proved Botanists should not require the geologists to be the only ones interested in the plants of the earlier ages A NEW DISTRIBUTION OF FUNGI UNDER the title of Ohio Fungi Exsiccati Professor W A Kellerman of the State University Columbus Ohio has begun the distribution of sets of specimens of the fungi of Ohio each accompanied bya copy of the original description of the species Fascicles I and II have now appeared and it is pos 633 sible to make out the place and value such a collection will have for working botanists In the prefatory statement accompanying the first fascicle we are told that the fascicles will appear from time to time as material may be available Original descriptions of all the species or that given in connection with the first use of the binomial or technical designa tion will be printed on the labels in addition to the data usually given Every botanist will see at once the importance of a distribution of this nature and it is to be regretted that the edition is so small the number of copies being but few more than those sent to work ing botanists The first fascicle contains sixteen specimens of which five are of Puc cinia three of iEcidium four of Cintractia and one each of Peronospora Phyllosticta Septoria and Ustilago The second fascicle is larger including twentysix specimens of which seven are species of Puccinia five of Uromyces three of Ustilago two of Gymno conia two of Gymnosporangium and one each of ZEcidium Gloeosporium Melampsora Pig gotia Polystictus Stereum and Urocystis The specimens are ample and are put up in neat packets Although these sets are in tended for exchanges only and not for sale we are informed that a few copies may be ob tained by those who wish to purchase them at one dollar per fascicle CHARLES E BESSEY THE UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA AERONAUTICS MR WILBUR WRIGHT presented to the West ern Society of Engineers September 18 1901 a notable paper describing experiments resem bling those of Liliendahl but decidedly more successful Advances have been made rapidly in many directions during the past fifteen or twenty years in some directions of interest in connection with aeronautics The motors have been greatly reduced in weight and spe cial constructions have been made by Langley and others in which the motor weighs but ten pounds and even less per horsepower where not many years ago weights of sixty pounds were exceptional and an engine weighing forty pounds per horsepower was a marvel Little APRIL 18 1902634 SCIENCE more has been done in the study of the prin ciples of safety and stability of the flying machine than was accomplished by Liliendahl by Pilcher and by Chanute in Germany in England and in the United States respective ly It is almost ten years since Maxim mounted his machine and actually flew a short distance at high speed and with disastrous results to his machine and danger to himself and the experiment has not been repeated Langleys experiments and discussions have provided us with a correct knowledge of the physical and the mathematical principles involved in flight so far as measures of lift and of head resist ance are concerned but the applied theory is still to be illustrated in any fullsized and practically useful apparatus The steadying action of the balloon is relied upon wherever as in the case of Myers of Frankfort N Y the oldest and most successful among pioneers in this line of development and in that of Dumont the inventor and exploiter one seeks to traverse the air safely Only when stability and permanence of stability can be insured can aviation become practicable The experi ments of the Messrs Wright of Dayton O mostly conducted at the shore on the coast of North Carolina have seemingly advanced our knowledge greatly in this direction The Wright apparatus is doubledecked like that of Chanute but the endeavor was to pro vide for direction and balance without shift ing the body of the aviator with every change in the direction and force of the wind It was found that practice would make perfect the experimenter here as in every other field of action that constant practice should be pro vided for that the horizontal position should be assumed by the operator and that it is actually practicable that a small steering vane could be set in advance of the aeroplanes adopted and successfullyemployed in direct ing flight and in counteracting the fluctuating action of the wind in disturbance of the posi tion of the center of pressure on the planes that twisting the planes is a more effective method of meeting the changes of pressure produced by wind disturbances of small extent than any system of movement of the body The machine finally adopted spread 308 N S VOL XV No 381 square feet of canvas was 22 feet long 7 feet high and doubledecked The wings or planes were given the section observed in the wing of the pigeon i e slightly curved from front to rear and with the curvature sharply increased at the leading edge in a degree determined necessarily by experiment Gliding or soar ing was successfully attempted with this con struction in winds of velocities ranging from 11 to 27 miles an hour and distances were attained with small elevation at the start up to a maximum range of about 400 feet the operator finding no special difficulty in either steering or balancing the machine The rate of drop was as low as two feet per second in some instances These investigations have probably dis closed a method of study of the action of the aerodrome which is comparatively safe which permits the investigator to dispense with a motor if he so desires during the preliminary work of tracing out the principles underlying stability and safe operation of the aviator in a moving atmosphere The work is a distinct contribution to existing knowledge in this fascinating field of research R I T U S CIVIL SERVICE EXAMINATIONS THE Civil Service Commission announces an examination on May 6 and 7 for positions in the Philippine service of agricultural chemist analytical chemist physical chemist physiological chemist and pharmacologist with salaries of 1500 to 1800 In announcing this examination the Commission sends the following statement These examinations offer an excellent oppor tunity to enter a service which has many attract ive features and to see a most interesting part of the world The Philippine Service is classified and the law contemplates promotions on the basis of merit from the lowest to the highest positions Thirty days leave of absence is granted each year exclusive of Sundays and holidays and those employees who are promoted to 1800 per annum are entitled to thirtyfive days or about forty days including Sundays and holidays Leave is also cumulative and at the end of three years those who have to their credit cumulative leave for two years may visit the United States without having

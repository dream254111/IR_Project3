S,i206953,c2 378 J XVII General Theorems chiefly Porisms in the higher Geoa met ry By Henry Brougham un Esq conmunicated by Sir Charles Blagden Knt Ff R S Read May 24 1798 TrHn following are a few propositions that have occurred to me in the course of a considerable degree of attention which I have happened to bestov upon that interesting though diffi cult branch of speculative mathematics the higher geometry They are all in some degree connected the greater part refer to the conic hyperbola as related to a variety of other curves Almost the whole are of that kind called porisms whose nature and origin is now well kndwn and if that mathematician to whom we owe the first distinct and popular account of this formerly mysterious but most interesting subject  should chance to peruse these pages he will find in them additional proofs of the accuracy which characterizes his inquiry into the discovery of this singularly beautiful species of proposition Though each of the truths which I have here enunciated is of a very general and extensive nature yet they are all disco vered by the application of certain principles or properties still more general and are thus only cases of propositions still more extensive Into a detail of these I cannot at present enter they compose a system of general methods by which the dis covery of propositions is effected with certainty and ease and  See Mr PLAYFAIRS Paper in Vol 111 of the Edinburgh TransMr BROUGHAMS general Theorems c 379 they are very probably in the doctrine of curve lines what the ancients appear to have prized so much in plain geometry al though unfortunately all that remains to us of that treasure is the knowledge of its high value Neither have I added the de monstrations which are all purely geometrical granting the methods of tangents and quadratures I have given an example in the abridged synthesis of what I consider as one of the most intricate It is unnecessary to apologize any farther for the conciseness of this tract Let it be remembered that were each proposition followed by its analysis and composition and the corollaries scholia limitations and problems immediately suggested by it without any trouble on the readers part the whole would form a large volume in the style of the ancient geometers containing the investigation of a series of con nected truths in one branch of the mathematics all arising from varying the combinations of certain data enumerated in a general enunciation As a collection of curious general truths of a nature so far as I know hitherto quite unknown I am persuaded this Paper with all its defects may not be unacceptable to those who feel pleasure in contemplating the varied and beautiful relations between abstract quantities the wonderful and extensive ana logies which every step of our progress in the higher parts of geometry opens to our view PROP I PORISM Tab XXI fig i A conic hyperbola being given a point may be found such that every straight line drawn from it to the curve shall cut in  See the celebrated account of ancient geometrical works in the eleventh book of PAPPUs ALEXANDRixUS 3 C2380 Mr BROUGHAMS general Theorems a given ratio that part of a straight line passing through a given point which is intercepted between a point in the curve not given but which may be found and the ordinate to the point where the first mentioned line meets the curve Let X be the point to be found NA the line passing through Xthe given point N and M any point whatever in the curve join XM and draw the ordilnate MP then AC is to CP in a given ratio Corollary This property suggests a very simple and accurate method of describing a conic hyperbola and then finding its centre asymptotes and axes or any of these being given of finding the curve and the remaining parts PROP II PORISM A conic hyperbola being given a point may be found such that if from it there be drawn straight lines to all the intersec tions of the given curve with an infinite number of parabolas or hyperbolas of any given order whatever lying between straight lines of which one passes through a given point and the other may be found the straight lines so drawn from the point found shall be tangents to the parabolas or hyperbolas This is in fact two propositions there being a construction for the case of parabolas and another for that of hyperbolas PROP XII PORISM If through any point whatever of a given ellipse a straight linebe drawn parallel to the conjugate axis and cutting the ellipse in another point and if at the first point a perpendi cular be drawn to the parallel a point may be found such that if from it there be drawn straight lines to the innumerablein the higber Geometry 3 X8 intersections of the ellipse with all the parabolas of orders not given but which may be found lying between the lines drawn at right angles to each other the lines so drawn from the point found shall be normals to the parabolas at their intersections with the ellipse PROP IV PORISM A conic hyperbola being given if through any point thereof a straight line be drawn parallel to the transverse axis and cutting the opposite hyperbolas a point may be found such that if from it there be drawn straight lines to the innumerable intersections of the given curve with all the hyperbolas of orders to be found lying between straight lines which may be found the straight lines sodrawn shall be normals to the hyy perbolas at the points of section SholinM The two last propositions give an instance of the many curious and elegant analogies between the hyperbola and ellipse failing however when by equating the axes we change the ellipse into a circle PROP V LOCAL THEOREM Fig 2 If from a given point A a straight line DE moves parallel to itself and another CS fromn a given point C moves along with it round C  and a point I moves along AB from H the middle point of AB with at velocity equal to half the velocity of DE then if AP be always taken a third proportional to AS and BC and through P with asymptotes DE and AB a conic hyperbola be described also focus I and axis AB a conic parabola be described the radius vector from C to M the182 Mr BROUGHAMS general Theorems intersection of the two curves moving round C shall describe a given ellipse PROP VI THEOREM A common logarithmic being given and a point without it a parabola hyperbola and ellipse may be described which shall intersect the logarithmic and each other in the same points the parabola shall cut the logarithmic orthogonally and if straight lines be drawn from the given point to the common intersections of the four curves these lines shall be normals to the logarithmic PROP VII PORISM Two points in a circle being given but not in one diameter another circle may be described such that if from any point thereof to the given points straight lines be drawn and a line touching the given circle the tangent shall be a mean pro portional between the lines so inflected Or more generally the square of the tangent shall have a given ratio to the rectangle under the inflected lines PROP VIII PORISM Fig 3 Two straight lines AB AP not parallel being given in position a conic parabola MN may be found such that if from any point thereof M a perpendicular MP be drawn to the one of the given lines nearest the curve and this perpendicular be produced till it meets the other line in B and if from B a line be drawn to a given point C MP shall have to PB together with CB a given ratioin the higher Geometry8 bolifunm This is a case of a most general enunciation  which gives rise to an infinite variety of the most curious porisms PROP IX PORISM Fig 4 A conic hyperbola being given a point may be found from which if straight lines be drawn to the intersections of the given curve with innumerable parabolas or hyperbolas of any given order whatever lying between perpendiculars which meet in a given point the lines so drawn shall cut in a given ratio all the areas of the parabolas or hyperbolas contained by the peripheries and coordinates to points thereof found by the in numerable intersections of another conic hyperbola which may be found This comprehends evidently two propositions one for the case of parabolas the other for that of hyperbolas In the for mer it is thus expressed with a figure Let EM be the given hyperbola BA AC the perpendiculars meeting in a given point A a point X may be found such that if XM be drawn to ayintersection M of EM with y parabola AMN of any given order whatever and lying between AB and AC XM shall cut in a given ratio the area AMNP contained by AMN and AP PN coordinates to the conic hyperbola ENwhich is to be fouid thus the area ARM shall be to the area RMNP in a given ratio PROP X PORISM A conic hyperbola being given a point may be found such that if from it there be drawn straight lines to the innumerable intersections of the given curve with all fhe straight lines drawn thorough a given pointI in one of the given asymptotes the384 Mr BROUJGHAM general Theorems first mentioned lines shall cut in a given ratio the areas of all the triangles whose bases and altitudes are the coordinates to a second conic hyperbola which may be found at the points where it cuts the lines drawn from the given point PROP XI PORISM A conic hyperbola being given a straight line may be found such that if another move along it in a given angle and pass through the intersections of the curve with all the parabolas or hyperbolas of any given order whatever lying between straight lines to be found the moving line shall cut in a given ratio the areas of the curves described contained by the peri pheries and coordinates to another conic hyperbola that may be found at the points where this cuts the curves described PROP XII PORISM A conic hyperbola being given a straight line may be found along which if another move in a given angle and pass through any point whateverof the hyperbola and if this point of sec tion be joined with another that may be found the moving line shall cut in a given ratio the triangles whose bases and alti tudes are the coordinates to a conic hyperbola which may be found at the points where it meets the lines drawn from the point found Scholium I proceed to give one or two examples wherein areas are cut in a given ratio not by straight lines but by curves PROP XIII PORIsM Fig I  A conic hyperbola being given if through any of its innu merable intersections with all the parabolas of any order lyingin the higher Geometry between straight lines whereof one is an asymptote and the other may be found an hyperbola of any order be described except the conic from a given origin in the given asymptote perpendicular to the axis of the parabolas the hyperbola thus described shall cut in a given ratio an area of the parabolas which may be always found If from G as origin in AB one of LMs asymptotes there be described an hyperbola IC of any order whatever except the first and passing through M a point where LM cuts any of the parabolas AM of any order whatever drawn from A a point to be found and lying between AB and AC an area ACD may be always found that is for every case of AM and IC which shall be constantly cut by IC in the given ratio of M N that is the area AMN NMDC  M N I omit the analysis which leads to the following construc tion and composition Construction Let m  n be the order of the parabolas and p  q that of the hyperbolas Find p a fourth proportional to m  n q p and divide GB in A so that AR AG q p  A then find vr a fourth proportional to M  N q p and q p and y a fourth proportional to q AG and q p and lastly 0 a fourth proportional to the parameter of LM 7 and M If with a parameter equal to mtn x  M  N of the rect angle r AN and between the asymptotes AB AC a conic hyperbola be described it shall cut the parabola in a point the coordinates to which contain an area that shall be cut by IC in the ratio of M N Demonstration

remains the area MPN equal to  x AP x MP x PT which was before demonstrated to be together with APM M equal to l ACD Wherefore MPN together with APM M that is the area AMN is equal to M ACD consequently AMN ACD  M M  N and dividends AMN NMDC M  N An area has therefore been found which the hy perbola IC always cuts in a given ratio Wherefore a conic hyperbola being given c Q E D Scholium This proposition points out in a very striking manner the connection between all parabolas and hyperbolas and their common connection with the conic hyperbola The demonstration which I have given is much abridged and to avoid circumlocution algebraic symbols and even ideas have been introduced but by attending to the several steps any one will easily perceive that it may be translated into geome trical language and conducted upon purely geometrical prin ciples if any numbers be substituted for m n p and q or if these letters be made representatives of lines and if concise ness be less rigidly studied PROP XIV THEOREM A common logarithmic being given if from a given point as origin a parabola or hyperbola of any order whatever be described cutting in a given ratio a given area of the loga rithmic the point where this curve meets the logarithmic is always situated in a conic hyperbola which may be found Scbolium This proposition is properly speaking neither a porism a theorem nor a problem It is not a theorem be cause something is left to be found or as PAPPUS expressesin the higher Geometry 389 it there is a deficiency in the hypothesis neither is it a porism for the theorem from which the deficiency distin guishes it is not local PROP XV PORISM Fig 6 A conic hyperbola being given two points may be founde from which if straight lines be inflected to the innumerable intersections of the given curve with parabolas or hyperbolas of any given order whatever described between given straight lines and if coordinates be drawn to the intersections of these curves with another conic hyperbola which may be found the lines inflected shall always cut off areas that have to one another a given ratio from the areas contained by the co ordinates Let X and Y be the points found HD the given hyperbola FE the one to be found ADC one of the curves lying between AB and AG intersecting HD and FE join XD YD then the area AYD XDCB in a given ratio PROP XVI PORISM Fig 7 If between two straight lines making a right angle an infi nite number of parabolas of any order whatever be described a conic parabola may be drawn such that if tangents be drawn to it at its intersections with the given curves these tangents shall always cut in a given ratio the areas contained by the given curves the curve found and the axis of the given curves Let AMN be one of the given parabolas  DMO the parabola found and TM its tangent at M ATM shall have to TMMR a given ratio390 Mr BROUGHAmS general Theoremts PROP  XVII PORISM A parabola of any order being given two straight lines may be found between which if innumerable hyperbolas of any order be described the areas cut off by the hyperbolas and the given parabola at their intersections shall be divided in a given ratio by the tangents to the given curve at the intersections and conversely if the hyperbolas be given a parabola may be found c c PROP XVIII PORISM A parabola of any order m  n being given another of an order m 4 2 n may be found such that the rectangle under its ordinate and a given line shall have always a given ratio to the area of the given curve whose abscissa bears to that of the curve found a given ratio Example Let mI 1 n  1 and let the given ratios be those of equality the proposition is this a conic parabola being given a semicubic one may be found such that the rectangle under its ordinate and a given line shall be always equal to the area of the given conic parabola at equal abscissae Scbolium A similar general proposition may be enunciated and exemplified with respect to hyperbolas and as these are only cases of a proposition applying to all curves whatsoever I shall take this opportunity of introducing a very simple and I think perfectly conclusive demonstration of the 28th lemma Princzjpia Book I that no oval can be squared It is well known that the demonstration which Sir ISAAC NEWTON gives of this lemmna is not a little intricate and whether from this difli culty or from some real imperfection or from a very naturalin the higher Geometry 391 wish not to believe that the most celebrated desideratum in geometry must for ever remain a desideratum certain it is that many have been inclined to call in question the conclusiveness of that proof Let AMC be any curve whatever fig 8 and D a given line take in a b a part ap having to AP a given ratio and erect a perpendicular p m such that the rectangle p m D shall have to the area APM a given ratio it is evident that m will describe a curve amc which can never cut the axis unless in a Now becausep m is proportional to APM or to APM pm will always increase ad in finitum if AMC is infinite but if AMC stops or returns into itself that is if it is an oval p m is a maximum at b the point of a b corresponding to B in AB con sequently the curve amc stops short and is irrational There fore pm its ordinate has not a finite relation to ap its abscissa But ap has a given ratio to AP therefore pm has not a finite relation to AP and APM has a given ratio to p m therefore it has not a finite relation to AP that is APM cannot he found in finite terms of AP or is incommensurate with AP wherefore the curve AMB cannot be squared Now AMB is any oval wherefore no oval can be squared By an argument of precisely the same kind it may proved that the rectification also of every oval is impossible Wherefore c Q E D I shall subjoin three problems that occurred during the con sideration of the foregoing propositions The first is an example of the application of the porisms to the solution of problems The second gives besides a new method of resolving one of the most celebrated ever proposed KEPLERS problem and392 Mr BROUJGHAMs general Tbeorems the last presents to our view a curve before unknown at least to me as possessing the singular property of a constant tangent PROP XIX PROBLEM Fig 9 A common logarithmic being given to describe a conic hy perbola such that if from its intersection with the given curve a straight line be drawn to a given point it shall cut a given area of the logarithmic in a given ratio The analysis leads to this Construction Let BME be the logarithmic G its modula  AB the ordinate at its origin A let C be the given point ANOB the given area M N the given ratio draw BQ parallel to AN find D a fourth proportional to M the rectangle BQ  OQ and M  N From AD cut off a part AL equal to AC together with twice G at L make LH perpendicular to AD and be tween the asymptotes AL HL with a parameter  twice D  2  AB G describe a conic hyperbola it is the curve required PROP XX PROBLEM Fig 1o To draw through the focus of a given ellipse a straight line that shall cut the area of the ellipse in a given ratio Construction Let AB be the transverse axis EF the semi conjugate E of consequence the centre C and L the foci On AB describe a semicircle Divide the quadrant AK in the given ratio in which the area is to be cut and describe the cycloid

the focus Q K D Of this solution it may be remarked that it does not assume as a postulate the description of the cycloid but givesa simple construction of that curve flowing from a curious property whereby it is related to a given circle This cycloid too gives by its intersection with the ellipse the point required directly and not by a subsequent construction as Sir I NEWTONS does I was induced to give the demonstration from a conviction that it is a good instance of the superiority of modern over ancientin the higher Geometry 39g analysis and in itself perhaps no inelegant specimen of alge braic demonstration PROP XXI PROBLEM Fig ii To find the Curve whose Tangent is always of the same Mag nitude Analysis Let MN be the curve required AB the given axis SM a tangent at any point M and let

corollaries the most remark able things that have occurred to me concerning this curve Corollary 1 The subtangent of this curve is vdz yZ Corollary 2 In order to draw a tangent to it from a given point without it from this point as pole with radius equal to d and the curves axis as directrix describe a conchoid of Nico medes to its intersections with the given curve draw straight lines from the given point these will touch the curve Corollary 3 This curve may be described organically by drawing one end of a given flexible line or thread along a straight line whilst the other end is urged by a weight towards the same straight line It is consequently the curve of traction to a straight line Corollary 4 In order to describe this curve from its equation change the one given above by transferring the axes of its coordinates it becomes y being  PM and x  AP y x sVd xzdxhl b which may be usedwith  V 2 X2 ease by changing the hyperbolic into the tabular logarithm Thus then the

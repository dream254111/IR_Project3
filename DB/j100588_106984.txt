PROPOSITIONS THAT HAVE OCCURRED TO ME IN THE COURSE OF A CONSIDERABLE DEGREE OF ATTENTION WHICH I HAVE HAPPENED TO BESTOV UPON THAT INTERESTING THOUGH DIFFI CULT BRANCH OF SPECULATIVE MATHEMATICS THE HIGHER GEOMETRY THEY ARE ALL IN SOME DEGREE CONNECTED THE GREATER PART REFER TO THE CONIC HYPERBOLA AS RELATED TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CURVES ALMOST THE WHOLE ARE OF THAT KIND CALLED PORISMS WHOSE NATURE AND ORIGIN IS NOW WELL KNDWN AND IF THAT MATHEMATICIAN TO WHOM WE OWE THE FIRST DISTINCT AND POPULAR ACCOUNT OF THIS FORMERLY MYSTERIOUS BUT MOST INTERESTING SUBJECT  SHOULD CHANCE TO PERUSE THESE PAGES HE WILL FIND IN THEM ADDITIONAL PROOFS OF THE ACCURACY WHICH CHARACTERIZES HIS INQUIRY INTO THE DISCOVERY OF THIS SINGULARLY BEAUTIFUL SPECIES OF PROPOSITION THOUGH EACH OF THE TRUTHS WHICH I HAVE HERE ENUNCIATED IS OF A VERY GENERAL AND EXTENSIVE NATURE YET THEY ARE ALL DISCO VERED BY THE APPLICATION OF CERTAIN PRINCIPLES OR PROPERTIES STILL MORE GENERAL AND ARE THUS ONLY CASES OF PROPOSITIONS STILL MORE EXTENSIVE INTO A DETAIL OF THESE I CANNOT AT PRESENT ENTER THEY COMPOSE A SYSTEM OF GENERAL METHODS BY WHICH THE DIS COVERY OF PROPOSITIONS IS EFFECTED WITH CERTAINTY AND EASE AND  SEE MR PLAYFAIRS PAPER IN VOL 111 OF THE EDINBURGH TRANSMR BROUGHAMS GENERAL THEOREMS C 379 THEY ARE VERY PROBABLY IN THE DOCTRINE OF CURVE LINES WHAT THE ANCIENTS APPEAR TO HAVE PRIZED SO MUCH IN PLAIN GEOMETRY AL THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY ALL THAT REMAINS TO US OF THAT TREASURE IS THE KNOWLEDGE OF ITS HIGH VALUE NEITHER HAVE I ADDED THE DE MONSTRATIONS WHICH ARE ALL PURELY GEOMETRICAL GRANTING THE METHODS OF TANGENTS AND QUADRATURES I HAVE GIVEN AN EXAMPLE IN THE ABRIDGED SYNTHESIS OF WHAT I CONSIDER AS ONE OF THE MOST INTRICATE IT IS UNNECESSARY TO APOLOGIZE ANY FARTHER FOR THE CONCISENESS OF THIS TRACT LET IT BE REMEMBERED THAT WERE EACH PROPOSITION FOLLOWED BY ITS ANALYSIS AND COMPOSITION AND THE COROLLARIES SCHOLIA LIMITATIONS AND PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY SUGGESTED BY IT WITHOUT ANY TROUBLE ON THE READERS PART THE WHOLE WOULD FORM A LARGE VOLUME IN THE STYLE OF THE ANCIENT GEOMETERS CONTAINING THE INVESTIGATION OF A SERIES OF CON NECTED TRUTHS IN ONE BRANCH OF THE MATHEMATICS ALL ARISING FROM VARYING THE COMBINATIONS OF CERTAIN DATA ENUMERATED IN A GENERAL ENUNCIATION AS A COLLECTION OF CURIOUS GENERAL TRUTHS OF A NATURE SO FAR AS I KNOW HITHERTO QUITE UNKNOWN I AM PERSUADED THIS PAPER WITH ALL ITS DEFECTS MAY NOT BE UNACCEPTABLE TO THOSE WHO FEEL PLEASURE IN CONTEMPLATING THE VARIED AND BEAUTIFUL RELATIONS BETWEEN ABSTRACT QUANTITIES THE WONDERFUL AND EXTENSIVE ANA

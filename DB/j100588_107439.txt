J100588,PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSACTIONS OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON,107439,ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED IN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND OTHER BODIES TO WHICH THE SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURE OF THAT SUBSTANCE CAN BE COMMUNICATED,I206969,C 397 XIX ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED IN THE OPTICAL PHE NOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND OTHER BODIES TO WHICH THE SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURE OF THAT SUBSTANCE CAN BE COMMUNICATED BY DAVID BREWSTER LL D   F EDIN AND F SA  EDIN IN A LETTER ADDRESSED TO THE RIGHT LION SIR JOSEPH BANKS BART K B P R S READ APRIL 8 181 4 IN THE PROSECUTION OF MY INQUIRIES INTO THE MODIFICATIONS IMPRESSED UPON LIGHT BY TLHE VARIOUS BODIES OF THE ANIMAL THE VEGETABLE AND THE MINERAL KINGDOM I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO DISCOVER SEVERAL NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT AND TO ESTABLISH THE LAWS WHICH REGULATE THE MOST REMARKABLE OF THE PHENOMENA A FEW OF THESE RESULTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN LAID BEFORE THE ROYAL SOCIETY AND FROM THE RECEPTION WHICH THEY HAVE EXPERIENCED I HAVE TAKEN THE LIBERTY OF ADDRESSING TO YOU THE FOLLOWING PAPER CONTAINING A SERIES OF NEW FACTS REMARK ABLE FOR THEIR EXTREME SINGULARITY AND THEIR OPPOSITION TO ALMOST ALL OUR NOTIONS OF THE ACTION OF BODIES UPON THE LUMINOUS RAYS THE EXTRAORDINARY CHARACTER WHICH THESE EXPERIMENTS AT FIRST ASSUMED INDUCED ME TO THINK THAT I HAD OVERLOOKED SOME SOURCE OF DECEPTION AND IT WAS NOT TILL I HAD PERFORMED THEM UNDER EVERY VARIETY OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND TILL THEY HAD BEEN REPEATED AND VIEWED IN THE SAME LIGHT BY SEVERAL OF MY FRIENDS THAT I PREVAILED UPON MYSELF TO BRING THEM UNDER YOUR NOTICE THE SPLENDID EXLHIBITION OF COLOURS WHICH DISTINGUISHES MDCCCXIV Q F398 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED MOTHER OF PEARL FROM EVERY OTHER SUBSTANCE AND THE SUCCES SIVE DEVELOPERENT OF FRESH TINTS BY EVERY GENTLE INCLINATION OF THE PLATE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ASCRIBED TO THE LAMELLATED STRUCTURE OF THE SHELL AND HAVE BEEN REGARDED AS A FINE PROOF OF NEWTONS THEORY OF THE COLOURS OF NATURAL BODIES THIS EXPLANATION I HAD NO DISPOSITION TO CALL IN QUESTION NOR DID THE GENERAL TRAIN OF MY EXPERIMENTS LEAD ME TO SUCH AN INQUIRY IN EXAMINING THE COLOURED RINGS WHICH MOTHER OF PEARL LIKE THE TOPAZ EXHIBITS BY POLARISED LIGHT AND IN ASCERTAINING THE RELATION BETWEEN ITS REFRACTIVE POWER AND THE ANGLE AT WHICH IT GIVES POLARITY TO THE REFLECTED RAY I WAS UNDER THE NECESSITY OF GRINDING AND POLISHING WITH THE UTMOST CARE VARIOUS PLATES OF THIS SUBSTANCE THE DEVELOPEMENT OF NEW COLOURS AND THE EXTINCTION OF OTHERS WHICH TOOK PLACE DURING THESE PROCESSES INDICATED THE OPERATION OF SOME UNKNOWN AND EXTRAORDINARY CAUSE AND ENCOURAGED ME TO PAY THE MOST MINUTE ATTENTION TO ALL THE PHENOMENA WHICH WERE PRESENTED THE RESULTS OF THIS INVESTIGATION I SHALL ENDEAVOUR TO EXPLAIN UNDER THE FOUR FOLLOWING HEADS I ON THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES PECULIAR TO MOTHER OF PEARL II ON THE COMMUNICATION OF THESE PROPERTIES TO OTHER BODIES III ON THE CAUSES BY WHICH THESE PHENOMENA ARE PRODUCED IV ON A NEW SPECIES OF POLARISATION PECULIAR TO MOTHER OF PEARL I OT THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES PECULIAR TO IMOTHER O PEARL MOTHER OF PEARL SOMETIMES POSSESSES A REGULAR AND SOME TIMES AN IRREGULAR STRUCTURE AND HAS A STRIKING RESEMBLANCE TO THE AGATE IN THE IMMENSE VARIETY OF FORMS WLICH IT EXHIBITSIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMEKA OF MOTHER OF PEARL S99 SOMETIMES IT IS COMPOSED OF PARALLEL OR CONCENTRIC LAMINA SOMETIMES THE VEINS ARE INFLECTED IN VARIOUS SUCCESSIONS AND SOMETIMES IT EXHIBITS THE SAME APPEARANCES AS THOSE WHICH CONSTITUTE WHAT IS CALLED THE HAMMERED AGATE THE REGULARLY FORMED MOTHER OF PEARL IS OF AN UNIFORM WHITENESS SOMEWHAT RESEMBLING THE PEARL ITSELF ANDC IN DAY LIGHT SCARCELY EXHIBITING ANY OF THE PRISMATIC COLOURS AND UNLESS IT IS EXPRESSLY MENTIONED THIS IS ALWAYS THE KIND WHICH I HAVE USED IN THE FOLLOWING EXPERIMENTS LET AB FIG  IPI XIV BE A PLATE OF MOTHER OF PEARL NOT POLISHED BUT HAVING ITS TWO SURFACES GROUND PERFECTLY EITHER UPON A BLUE HONE OR UPON A PLATE OF GLASS WITH THE POWDER OF SCHISTUS AND LET THE LIGHT RROF A CANDLE BE INCIDENT AT ANY ANGLE ON THE POINT R THIS RAY WILL BE REFLECTED ACCORDING TO THE ORDINARY LAW SO THAT THE ANGLE RRC IS EQUAL TO CRS AND THE LINES RR CR AND SR IN THE SAME PLANE IF THE EYE IS NOW PLACED VERY CLOSE TO THE MOTHER OF PEARL AT B SO AS TO RECEIVE THE REFLECTED RAYS IT WILL PERCEIVE AT S IN THE DIRECTION RS THE COMMON REFLECTED IMAGE OF THE CANDLE WHICH WILL NOT BE VERY BRIGHT OWING TO THE ROUGHNESS OF THE REFLECTING SURFACE ON THE LOWER SIDE OF S AT THE DISTANCE OF SOME DEGREES THERE WILL ALSO BE SEEN A HIGHLY COLOURED IMAGE OF THE CANDLE AT S FORMED BY RAYS REFLECTED IN THE DIRECTION RS IN THIS SPECTRUM THE BLUE RAYS ARE NEAREST THE COMMON IMAGE AND THE COLOUR IS SO GREAT THAT IT REQUIRES A PRISM OF FLINT GLASS WITH A REFRACTING ANGLE OF 65 TO CORRECT IT A LARGE SECONDARY SPECTRUM BEING LEFT HAVING THE UNCORRECTED GREEN TOWARDS THE VERTEX OF THE PRISM IF THE CANDLE AT R IS KEPT STEADY AND THE PLATE AB TURNED ROUND R AS A CENTRE SO THAT THE RAY RR MAY PRESERVE THE SAME S F400 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED ANGLE OF INCIDENCE THE COLOURED RAY RS WILL HAVE A MOTION

THE OPPOSITE SURFACE OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 2 THE SAME PHENO MENA WILL BE OBSERVED BUT THE COLOURED RAY RS WILL NOW BE REFLECTED TOWARDS B AND WILL BE SEEN AT S ABOVE THE COMMON IMAGE S BEING FORMED BY RAYS REFLECTED IN THE DIRECTION RS THE EXTREMITY B THEREFORE OF THE AXIS AB WILL BE THE PRIMARY POLE OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION FOR THE LOWER SURFACE HENCE THE TWO SURFACES OF MOTHER OF PEARL HAVE ALWAYS THEIR POLES IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS UNLESS IN SPECIMENS WHERE A CHANGE OF STRUCTURE TAKES PLACE LET THE PLATE AB BE NOW BROUGHT INTO THE POSITION IN FIG 1 WHERE THE PLANE RSS COINCIDES WITH TILE PLANE OF ORDINARY RE FLECTION RRS AND LET IT BE PLACED UPON A GONIOIMETER SO THAT WE MAY ASCERTAIN BY MEASUREMENT THE CHANGES WHICH TAKE PLACE BY VARYING THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE RRC IT WILL THEN BE FOUND THAT THE ANGLE OF ABERRATION SRS REGULARLY INCREASES WITH THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE THE VARIATIONS WHICH IT UNDERGOES ARE REPRESENTED WITH TOLERABLE ACCURACY IN THE FOLLOWING

DESCRIBING A SEMICIRCLE ROUND R TILL IT REACHES B AND ANOTHER SEMICIRCLE FROM B TO A AGAININ THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL A POINT S IN THE EXTRAORDINARY RAY RS WILL DESCRIBE A CURVE ROUND

COMMON AND THEIR SEMNITRANSVERSE AXES SS ST OF UNEQUAL LENGTHS THE CONJUGATE AXIS MN IS A CONSTANT QUANTITY WHILE SS ST VARY ACCORDING TO THE LAW ALREADY MENTIONED AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCIDENCE THEREFORE THE POINT S WILL DESCRIBE OTHER CURVES SUCH AS MSNT WHICH APPROACH TO A CIRCLE AS THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE DIMI NIISHES THE ANGLES OF ABERRATION VARY IN DIFFERENT PIECES OF MOTHER OF PEARL BUT THERE IS NO DEVIATION FROM THE LAWS WHICH HAVE JUST BEEN EXPLAINED ON THVTE UTSIDE OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RAY RS FIGI A MASS OF COI 4REI LI IGHT RP MAKES ITS APPEARANCE NEARLY AT THE SAME DISTRNCE FROM THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY IAGE IS FROM THE COMMON IMAGE THESE THREE IMAGES ARE ALWAYS IN A STRAIGHT LINE BUT THE ANGLE OF ABERRATION OF THE MASS OF COLOURED LIGHT VARIES ACCORDING TO A LAW DIFFERENT FROM THAT OF THE EXTRAORDINARY RAY AT GREAT ANGLES OF INCIDENCE THIS MASS OF LIGHT IS OF A BEAUTIFUL CRIMSON COLOUR AT AN ANGLE OF ABOUT 37 IT BECOMES GREEN AND AT LESS ANGLES OF INCIDENCE IT ACQUIRES A YELLOW HUE APPROACHING TO WHITE AND BECOMES VERY LUMINOUS THESE COLOURS WHICH BECOME MORE BRILLIANT WHEN THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS POLISHED VARY WITH THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE 4034O4 DR BRTWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHBITED THE FRACTURE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ALWAYS REFLECTS THE EXTRA ORDINARY RAY RS AS IF THE SURFACE OF THE FRACTURE WERE PARALLEL TO THE REAL SURFACE BUT WHEN THE FRACTURE IS GROUND FLAT NO EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION TAKES PLACE WHEN THE EXTRAORDINARY RAY N IS REFLECTED FROM ANOTHER PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL IT EXPERIENCES AS MIGHT HAVE BEEN EXPECTED BOTH AN ORDINARY AND AN EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION IN VIRTUE OF THE ORDINARY REFLECTION AN IMAGE IS FORMED EXACTLY LIKE THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE BUT IN VIRTUE OF THE EXTRAORDI NARY REFLECTION THE HIGHLY COLOURED IMAGE IS SOMETIMES REN DERED MORE HIGHLY COLOURED AND AT OTHER TIMES CONVERTED INTO A GREENISH WHITE IMAGE ACCORDING AS THE SECOND REFLECTION CONSPIRES WITH OR OPPOSES THE FIRST HITHERTO WE HAVE ATTENDED TO THE PHENOMENA ONLY WHEN THE SURFACE IS ROUGH AND UNPOLISHED WHEN A SLIGHT DEGREE OF POLISH HOWEVER IS COMMUNICATED TO IT A NEW COLOURED IMAGE APPEARS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE COMMON IMAGE FORMED BY THE RAYS RT FIG I AND 2 THIS NEW ITMAGE RESEMBLES IN EVERY RESPECT THE OTHER COLOURED IMAGE AND FOLLOWS THE SAME LAWS AND AFTER A HIGH DEGREE OF POLISH IS INDUCED UPON THE MOTHER OF PEARL IT IS ALMOST AS BRIGHT AS THE FIRST COLOURED IMAGE WHICH HAS ITS BRILLIANCY SOMEWHAT IMPAIRED BY POLISH ING IF THE POLISH IS REMOVED BY GRINDING THE SECOND COLOURED IMAGE VANISHES AND THE FIRST RESUMES ITS FORMER BRILLIANCY AS THIS SECOND IMAGE IS REFLECTED TOWARDS THE POLE A IN FIG I AND THE POLE B IN FIG 2 THEY MAY BE CALLED THE SECONDARYPOLES OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION IF WE NOW EXAMINE THE LIGHT TRANSMITTED BY THE MOTHER OF PEARL WE SHALL PERCEIVE PHENOMENA ANALOGOUS TO THOSE WHICH HAVE BEEN DESCRIBED A COLOURED IMAGE WILL APPEAR ON EACHIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA MOTHER OF PEARL SIDE OF THE COMMON IMAGE HAVING THE SAME ANGLES OF ABER RATION AS THOSE SEEN BY REFLECTION AND RESEMBLING THEM IN EVERY RESPECT THE BLUE LIGHT BEING NEAREST THE CONMON IMAGE AND THE RED LIGHT FARTHEST FROM IT THESE TWO IMAGES HOW EVER ARE USUALLY FAINTER THAN THOSE SEEN BY REFLECTION AND WHEN THE SECOND EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTED IMAGE IS EXTINGUISHED BY REMOVING THE POLISH IT IS THEN THE MOST BRILLIANT WHEN SEEN BY TRANSMISSION AND IN GENERAL THE IMAGE WHICH IS BRIGHTEST BY REFLECTION IS FAINTEST BY TRANSMISSION IN SOME IRREGULARLY FORMED PIECES OF MOTHER OF PEARL WHICH ARE GROUND VERY THIN AND IN WHICH THE AXES OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION FOR THE TWO SURFACES ARE NOT COINCIDENT FOUR COLOURED IMAGES ARE SEEN BY TRANSMISSION TWO OF THEM ARE PRODUCED BY EACH SURFACE AND THE LINE WHICH JOINS THE TWO IMAGES FORMED BY THE SAME SURFACE ALWAYS COINCIDES WITH ITS AXIS OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION IT IS ALSO DESERVING OF NOTICE THAT THE TRANSMITTED EXTRAORDINARY RAY IS BENT TOWARDS THE SAME POLE AS THE EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTED RAY TO WHICH IT BELONGS LIKE ALL OTHER BODIES MOTHER OF PEARL POLARISES LIGHT BY REFLECTION AND THE ANGLE AT WHICH THE QUANTITY OF POLARISED LIGHT IS A MAXIMUM IS ABOUT 59 THE TWO EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES ARE ALSO POLARISED AT THE SAME ANGLE BUT THE MASS OF GREEN AND CRIMSON LIGHT EXHIBITS NO MARKS OF POLARITY THIS SUBSTANCE HAS ALSO THE PROPERTY OF DEPOLARISING LIGHT IN EVERY POSITION LIKE HORN TORTOISE SHELL CAOUTCHOUC AND GUM ARABIC AND IT EXHIBITS BY POLARISED LIGHT THOSE BRILLIANTLY COLOURED RINGS WHICH I HAVE DESCRIBED IN A FORMER PAPER AS PRODUCED BY TOPAZ AND OTHER BODIES MDDCCCXIV 405 S406 DR BREWSTER ON NZEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED II ON THE COMMUNICATION OF THE PROPERTIES OF MOTHER OF PEARL TO OTHER BODIES THE PHENOMENA WHICH HAVE NOW BEEN DESCRIBED MUST BE ADMITTED TO BE VERY SINGULAR AND INSTRUCTIVE EVEN IF THE IN QUIRY HAD BEEN PUSHED NO FARTHER AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT PHILOSOPHERS WOULD HAVE CONTENTED THEMSELVES WITH ASCRIBING THEM TO REFLECTIONS FROM DIFFERENTLY INCLINED PLANES IN THE IN TERIOR OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL IN ORDER TO MEASURE THE ANGLES CONTAINED IN THE PRECEDING TABLES I HAD OCCASION TO FIX THE MOTHER OF PEARL TO A GONIO METER BY A HARD CEMENT UPON REMOVING IT FROM THE CEMENT THE PLATE LEFT A CLEAN IMPRESSION OF ITS OWN SURFACE AND I WAS SURPRISED TO OBSERVE THAT THE CEMENT HAD BY THIS MEANS RE CEIVED THE PROPERTY OF PRODUCING THE COLOURS WHICH WERE EX HIBITED BY THE MOTHER OF PEARL THIS STFRANGE RESULT I AT FIRST ATTRIBUTED TO A THIN FILM DETACHED FROM THE PLATE BUT SUBSE QUENT EXPERIMENTS SOON CONVINCED ME THAT THIS WAS A MISTAKE AND THAT THE MOTHER OF PEARL REALLY COMMUNICATED TO THE CEMENT THE PROPERTIES WHICH IT POSSESSED I HAVE ALSO SUCCEEDED IN IMPARTING THE SAME FACULTY OF PRO DUCING COLOUR TO BLACK AND RED WAX BALSAM OF TOLU GUM ARABIC GOLD LEAF PLACED UPON WAX TINFOIL THE FUSIBLE METAL COMPOSED OF BISMUTH AND MERCURY AND TO LEAD BY HARD PRES SURE OR BY THE BLOW OF A HAMMER WHEN THE IMPRESSION IS FIRST MADE UPON THE FUSIBLE METAL THE PLAY OF COLOURS IS SIN GULARLY FINE BUT THE ACTION OF THE AIR CORRODES THE METAL AND SPEEDILY DESTROYS THE CMNFIGURATION AS WELL AS THE POLISH OF ITS SURFACE THE SAME EFFECT WAS PRODUCED WHEN THE METAL WAS IMMERSED IN OILZN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL IN ORDER TO SHEW THAT IN THESE CASES NO PART OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS DETACHED I PLUINGED THE WAX AFTER IT HAD RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION INTO NITRIC ACID WHICH HAD NO EFFECT EITHER IN DESTROYING OR DIMINISHING THE COLORIFIC PROPERTY OF THE SUR FACE IN SOFT CEMENTS MADE OF BEES WAX AND ROSIN THE SLIGHTEST DEGREE OF HEAT DESTROYED THE SUPERFICIAL CONFIGURA TION BY WHICH THE COLOUR IS PRODUCED IN SEALING WAX GUM ARABIC AND REALGAR A MUCH GREATER HEAT WAS REQUISITE TO RE MOVE THE COLOUR AND IN TINFOIL AND LEAD THIS COULD ONLY BE EFFECTED BY THE TEMPERATURE AT WHICH THEY CEASE TO BECOME SOLID LET US NOW EXAMINE MORE MINUTELY THE PHENOMENA WHICH PRESENT THEMSELVES WHEN THE LIGHT IS REFLECTED FROM THE SUR FACE OF WAX AND LET US SUPPOSE THAT THE IMPRESSION UPON THE WAX IS MADE BY THE LOWER SURFACE WHEN ROUGH OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL AS REPRESENTED IN FIG 2 WHERE B IS ITS PRIMARY AND A ITS SECONDARY POLE WHEN THE LIGHT RR OF A CANDLE IS RE FLEETED FROM THE SURFACE OF WAX AB FIG 3 THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE INSTEAD OF BEING REFLECTED TOWARDS THE PRIMARY POLE B AS IN FIG 2 IS REFLECTED FROM IT AND A IS THE PRIMARY POLE OF THE WAX WHEREAS B WAS THE PRIMARY POLE OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL BY POLISHING THE MOTHER OF PEARL AND TAKING A NEW IMPRESSION FROM IT THE WAX WILL NOW REFLECT THE OTHER EXTRA ORDINARY IMAGE IN THE DIRECTION RT AND THEREFORE B IS THE SE CONDARY POLE OF THE WAX HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT MOTHER OF PEARL COMMUNICATES TO WAX AND OTHER BODIES THE OPTICAL PROPERTIES OF THI SURFACE OPPOSITE TO THAT FROM WHICH THE IMPRESSION IS TAKEN AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCIDENCE THE TWO COLOURED IMAGES FORMED BY THE WAX FOLIOW THE SAME LAWS AS THOSE PRODUCED BY THE MOTHER OF PEARL BUT THE MASS OF GREEN AND CRIMSON 3G2 47408 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED LIGHT NEVER APPEARS AND IS THEREFORE CAUSED BY SOME INTERNAL STRUCTURE WHICH CANNOT BE COMMUNICATED TO OTHER BODIES WHEN AN IMPRESSION IS TAKEN FROM THE FRACTURE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ITS FACULTY OF PRODUCING COLOUR IS ALSO COMMUNICATED IN IMPARTING TO GUM ARABIC AND BALSAM OF TOLU THE SUPER FICIAL CONFIGURATION OF MOTHER OF PEARL WE ARE ENABLED ON ACCOUNT OF THEIR TRANSPARENCY TO OBSERVE THE CHANGES INDUCED UPON THE TRANSMITTED LIGHT THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES FORMED BY REFLECTION WERE BOTH VISIBLE THE PRIMARY ONE BEING RE MARKABLY BRILLIANT AND THE SECONDARY ONE SCARCELY PERCEPTIBLE BUT WHEN THE LIGHT WAS TRANSMITTED THROUGH THE GUM THE PRIMARY IMAGE WAS NEARLY EXTINCT WHILE THE SECONDARY ONE WAS UNUSUALLY BRILLIANT AND HIGHLY COLOURED FAR SURPASSING IN SPLENDOUR THOSE WHICH ARE FORMED BY TRANSMISSION THROUGH THE MOTHER OF PEARL ITSELF WHEN BOTH THE SURFACES OF GUM ARABIC ARE IMPRESSED WITH MOTHER OF PEARL FOUR IMAGES ARE SEEN THE COLOURS SEEN BY TRANSMISSION ARE MORE BRILLIANT IN THE GUM THAN IN THE BALSAM AS THE LATTER HAS THE GREATEST REFLECTIVE POWER BUT THE COLOURED IMAGES PRODUCED BY RE FLECTION DO NOT SEEM TO HAVE SUFFERED A GREATER DISPERSION WHEN THEY ARE FORMED BY THE METALS THAN WHEN THEY ARE FORMED BY CEMENTS WHEN THE IMPRESSION IS TAKEN FROM A PEARL THE WAX RE CEIVES A CHARACTER SIMILAR TO THAT WHICH IS POSSESSED BY THE PEARL THE IMAGE REFLECTED FROM THE SURFACE OF THE PEARL IS ENVELOPED IN A QUANTITY OF UNFORMED LIGHT ARISING FROM A CAUSE WHICH WILL AFTERWARDS BE EXPLAINED AND THE VERY SAME WHITE NEBULOSITY IS REFLECTED FROM THE WAXIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL III ON THE CAUSES OF THE PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL FROM A CAREFUL EXAMINATION OF THE PRECEDING FACTS WE MUST NOW BE PREPARED TO INFER THAT ALL THE PECULIAR PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL AS SEEN BY REFLECTION AND TRANSMISSION ARE OZING TO A PARTICULAR CONFIGURATIO OFSU E THAT THE COMMUN CATION OF THESE PROPERTIES TO OTHER BODIES IS THE NECESSARY CONSEQUENCE OF THE COMMUNICATION OF ITS SUPERFICIAL STRUCTURE AND THAT NONE OJ THE LIGHT WHICH IS CONCERNED IN THE PRODUCTION OF THESE PHENOMENA HAS PENETRATED THE SURFACE OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL WHAT THIS CONFIGURATION OF SURFACE IS AND IN WHAT MANNER IT GENERATES THE COLOURED IMAGES ARE POINTS OF HIGH INTEREST AND OF CORRESPONDING DIFFICULTY THE FACTS NATURALLY LEAD US TO CONJECTURE THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTIONS ARE PRODUCED BY FACES EITHER CURVED OR RECTILINEAL SLIGHTLY INCLINED TO THE GENERAL SURFACE OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL IN ATTEMPTING TO DETERMINE THIS POINT I ANTICIPATED NO ASSISTANCE FROM MICRO SCOPICAL OBSERVATIONS AS IT WAS CONTRARY TO ALL OUR NOTIONS OF THE ACTION OF BODIES UPON LIGHT TO IMAGINE THAT A PLATE OF MOTHER OF PEARL REFLECTING AN IMAGE AS PERFECTLY AS THE MIRROR OF A TELESCOPE COULD EXHIBIT TO THE HUMAN EYE ANY SUPERFICIAL IRREGULARITIES THESE ANTICIPATIONS HOWEVER WERE WHOLLY ERRONEOUS BY THE APPLICATION OF SINGLE MICROSCOPES WITH POWERS OF S00 3O0 AND EVEN 400 I HAVE DISCOVERED IN ALMOST EVERY SPECIMEN OF MOTHER OF PEARL AN ELEMENTARY GROOVED SURFACE WHICH NO POLISHING CAN MODIFY OR REMOVE THIS STRUCTURE RESEMBLES VERY CLOSELY THE DELICATE TEXTURE OF THE SKIN AT THE TOP OF AN INFANTS FINGER OR THE LINES PARALLEL TO THE COAST UPON A MAP BY WHICH THE ENGRAVER MARKS THE LIMITS OF THE SEA AND LAND WHEN THE MOTHER OF PEARL HAS A REGULAR 4094IO DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED STRUCTURE THESE GROOVES OR LINES ARE ALWAYS PARALLEL BUT WHEN THERE IS ANY IRREGULARITY OF CONFIGURATION THE GROOVES VARY THEIR DIRECTION AND ARE ARRANGED IN ALL POSSIBLE FORMS LIKE THE VEINS OF AGATE OR LIKE THE LINES UPON THE COAST OF A MAP WHERE THERE ARE NUMEROUS INLETS AND ISLANDS TO BE REPRESENTED SOMETIMES THE SPACES BETWEEN THE GROOVES ARE SO WIDE THAT THEY CAN BE SEEN WITH A MAGNIFYING POWER OF SIX OR EIGHT TIMES AND IN ONE OR TWO SPECIMENS I HAVE OBSERVED THEM WITH THE NAKED EYE AT SOME PARTS OF THE SURFACE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE GROOVES IS SO SMALL THAT I HAVE COUNTED MORE THAN 30OOO IN AN INCH AND IN SOME PIECES THEY CAN SCARCELY BE DETECTED WITH ANY MAGNIFYING POWER WHICH I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO APPLY WHEN THE SPACE BETWEEN THE GROOVES IS LARGE A NEW GROOVE OFTEN COMMENCES AND THERE IS FREQUENTLY A SUDDEN CHANGE FROM A SPACE WITH A SERIES OF DISTANT GROOVES TO ANOTHER SPACE WITH A SERIES OF VERY CLOSE ONES SIMILAR APPEARANCES WERE ALSO SEEN IN THE STRUCTURE OF PEARLS WHEN THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS SCRATCHED OR INDENTED THE BOTTOM AND THE SIDES OF THE SCRATCH ARE GROOVED EXACTLY LIKE THE PARTS THAT ARE POLISHED THE SAME GROOVED STRUCTURE IS LIKEWISE DISTINCTLY SEEN IN WAX GUU ARABIC AND THE METALS AFTER THEY HAVE RECEIVED THE IMPRESSION OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL IN EVERY CASE THE GROOVES ARE AT RIGHT ANGLES TO THE AXIS OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION AND HENCE IN IRREGULARLY FORMED MOTHER OF PEARL WHERE THE GROOVES ARE OFTEN CIRCULAR AND HAVE EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION THE AXES OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION HAVE ALSO EVERY POSSIBLE DIRECTION AND THE COLOURED IMAGES APPEAR IRREGULARLY SCATTERED ROUND THE ORDINARY IMAGE IN THE REAL PEARL THESE COLOURED IMAGES ARE CROWDED INTO A SMALL SPACE ROUND THE COMMON IMAGE ON ACCOUNT OF THE SPHERICAL FORM OFIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL THE PEARL AND THE VARIOUS HUES ARE THUS BLENDED INTO A WHITE UNFORMED LIGHT WHICH GIVES TO THIS SUBSTANCE ITS HIGH VALUE AS AN ORNAMENT HAVING THUS ASCERTAINED THAT THE SURFACE OF MOTHER OF PEARL IS ACTUALLY GROOVED AND DIFFIRENT IN THIS RESPECT FROM ALL OTHER BODIES THAT HAVE YET BEEN EXAMINED WE MUST NOW SEEK IN THIS PECULIARITY OF STRUCTURE THE CAUSE OF ITS OPTICAL PROPERTIES THE FACTS WHICH HAVE BEEN DETAILED IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS LETTER WILL ENABLE US TO DRAW SEVERAL IMPORTANT CONCLUSIONS OF A GENERAL NATURE BUT THEY LEAVE US IN THE DARK RESPECTING THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENA LET US NOW SUPPOSE THAT FIG 5 REPRESENTS A SECTION OF A PLATE OF MOTHER OF PEARL HAVING AANMBCB FOR ITS UPPER SUR FACE AND BANMBCA FOR ITS LOWER SURFACE LET OP BE THE LINE AT WHICH THE ATTRACTING OR REFRACTIVE FORCE ENDS AND WHERE THE REPULSIVE OR REFLECTING FORCE BEGINS AND LET THE REFLECTING FORCE TERMINATE AT MN ACCORDING TO THE NEWTONIAN THEORY WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THAT WHEN THE SURFACE AB OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL IS GROUND AS FLAT AS POSSIBLE AND BROUGHT TO A HIGH POLISH THE LIGHT WHICH IS INCIDENT ON THE REPULSIVE STRATUM MNCP IS REFLECTED AS IN ALL OTHER BODIES AND AFFORDS A PERFECT IMAGE OF THE OBJECT FROM WHICH IT RADIATES HENCE IT FOLLOWS THAT THE LIGHT WHICH FORMS THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES HAS ESCAPED REFLECTION AND PENETRATED THE ATTRACTIVE STRATUMN OP AND THAT ITS SEPARATION INTO COLOURS AND EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION ARE PRODUCED BY ONEOR MORE CAUSES RESIDING BETWEEN CP AND THE SURFACE AB OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL LET US FIRST ATTEND TO THE ABERRATION OF THE EXTRAORDINARY IMAGES SINCE THE REAL SURFACE OF AB IS COMPOSED OF FACES INCAINED TO THE GENERAL SURFACE ABCB WE ARE LED TO SUPPOSE 41141 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED THAT THE PRIMARY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE IS REFLECTED FROM THE FACE M WHILE THE SECONDARY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE IS REFLECTED FROM THE FACE N NOW THIS COULD ONLY HAPPEN FROM TWO CAUSES EITHER IN CONSEQUENCE OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL HAVING A REPUL SIVE FORCE DIFFERENT FROM THE ORDINARY REPULSIVE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES REFLECTION OR FROM ITS POSSESSING THE POWER OF REFLECTING LIGHT FROM ITS ACTUAL SURFACE THAT THIS EXTRAORDI NARY FORCE IS IN OTHER RESPECTS LIKE THE ORDINARY REFLECTING FORCE IS MANIFEST FROM A PORTION OF THE EXTRAORDINARY PENCIL BEING TRANSMITTED WHILE THE OTHER PORTION SUFFERS REFLECTION THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A FORCE BEING UNQUESTIONABLE WE HAVE NEXT TO CONSIDER THE FORM AND POSITION OF THE SURFACES TO WHICH IT BELONGS THE CHANGES IN THE ANGLE OF ABERRATION AT DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCIDENCE IS A PROOF THAT THE SURFACES M N PRESENT DIFFERENT INCLINATIONS TO THE INCIDENT RAY AND HENCE THEIR FORM MUST BE CURVILINEAL AS REPRESENTED BY THE DOTTED LINES ABOVE M AND N IF WE SUPPOSE THAT THE RAY HAS BEEN REFRACTED BEFORE IT EXPERIENCES THE EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION THE ANGLES OF ABERRATION STILL REQUIRE THAT THE FACES HAVE A CURVED FORM TAKING THE INDEX OF REFRACTION M  1653 AND MAKING A ANGLE OF INCIDENCE  A  ANGLE OF REFRACTION AND CONSEQUENTLY THE NEW ANGLE OF INCIDENCE UPON THE FACES M OR N B  ANGLE OF EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION AND Z  THE INCLINATION OF THE REFLECTING FACE M OR N THEN WE SHALL HAVE SIN A A  B B A SIN A AND Z  A NM Z 2 BY CALCULATING THE VALUE OF Z FOR DIFFERENT ANGLES OF INCIDENCE WE OBTAIN THE FOLLOWING RESULTSIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL 413 ANGLES OF INCIDENCE INCLINATION OF THE FACES M OR N 86 41   2 8 70  15 9 65   3 48 6 12 19 12  1 20 BUT SINCE THE REFRACTION CANNOT BE COMPLETED WHEN THE RAY REACHES THE SURFACES M OR N HAVING PASSED THROUGH ONLY HALF THE SPACE OF REFRACTING ACTIVITY LET US SUPPOSE THE VALUE OF M CORRESPONDING TO THE PARTIAL REFRACTION TO BE 1300 AND WE SHALL HAVE THE FOLLOWING VALUES OF Z ANGLES OF INCIDENCE INCLINATION OF THE FACES M N 86 41   13 34 70  916 5   8 19 60  7 4 1   0 20 IF THE LIGHT THEREFORE SUFFERS EITHER A TOTAL OR A PARTIAL REFRAC TION OR IF IT SUFFERS NO REFRACTION AT ALL THE EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION MUST BE MADE FROM FACES OF VARIABLE CURVATURE THE MOST UNACCOUNTABLE CIRCUMSTANCE HOWEVER ACCOMPANY ING THE EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION IS THE DIFFERENCE OF EFFECT PRODUCED UPON THE SURFACES M AND N BY REMOVING THE POLISH THE SURFACE M RETAINS ITS POWER OF REFLECTING THE PRIMARY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE NOTWITHSTANDING THE ROUGHNESS WHICH IS THUS SUPERINDUCED WHILE THE SURFACE N LOSES THE POWER OF REFLECTING THE SECONDARY IMAGE AND ACQUIRES THE FACULTY OF TRANSMITTING THE WHOLE OF THE COLOURED PENCIL WHICH COMPOSES IT THE FORCE THEREFORE WHICH REFLECTS THE PRIMARY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE WOULD APPEAR TO BE DIFFERENT FROM THAT WHICH REFLECTS THE SECONDARY EXTRAORDINARY IMAGE THE LATTER BEING WHOLLY DEPENDANT ON THE SMOOTHNESS OF THE SURFACE MDCDCXIV H414 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT EXHIBITED HITHERTO WE HAVE AVOIDED ALL CONSIDERATION OF THE CAUSE WHICH SEPARATES THE EXTRAORDINARY PENCILS INTO THEIR COMPONENT COLOURS NOR CAN WE PRETEND TO AFFORD EVEN A PLAUSIBLE CON JECTURE RESPECTING THEIR ORIGIN IT IS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT THE SEPARATION INTO COLOURS IS PRODUCED BEFORE THE PENCIL SUFFERS EXTRAORDINARY REFLECTION AND AS THE TRANSMITTED COLOURS ARE NOT COMPLEMENTARY TO THOSE WHICH ARE REFLECTED IT IS EQUALLY MANIFEST THAT THE PHENOMENON HAS NO CONNECTION WITH THE COLOURS OF THIN PLATES IF THE SPECTRA WERE PRODUCED BY THE ORDINARY DISPERSIVE FORCE OF THE BODY THEN THE DISPERSION OUGHT TO BE LEAST IN GUM ARABIC GREATER IN WAX AND STILL GREATER IN REALGAR AND THE METALS WHEREAS IN ALL THESE CASES THE QUANTITY OF COLOUR APPEARS TO BE THE SAME THE EXTRAORDINARY SPECTRA HAVE NO RESEMBLANCE WHATEVER TO THOSE WHICH ARE THE EFFECT OF INFLEXION AND EVEN IF WE COULD SUPPOSE TLLAT THE LIGHT WAS INFLECTED BY THE GROOVES THE CAUSE WOULD BE INADEQUATE TO EXPLAIN THE CONTINUANCE OF THE COLOUR WHEN THE PLANE OF INCI DENCE COINCIDES WITH THE DIRECTION OF THE GROOVES AND WHEN THERE ARE MANIFESTLY NO ANGLES TO BEND THE PASSING LIGHT BUT WHATEVER BE THE CAUSE OF THE PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL THE FACTS THEMSELVES ARE PECULIARLY INSTRUCTIVE AND NATURALLY LEAD US TO THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS I BESIDES THE ORDINARY FORCES WHICH REFLECT AND REFRACT LIGHT THERE RESIDE WITHOUT THE SURFACE OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND OF ALL BODIES TO WHICH ITS SUPERFICIAL CONFIGURATION CAN BE IMPARTED NEW FORCES WHICH REFLECT LIGHT AND SEPARATE IT INTO ITS COMPONENT COLOURS 2 THE LINES WHICH BOUND THE SPACE OF REFLECTING ACTIVITY IN ALL SURFACES WHICH POSSESS THIS CONFIGURATION ARE STRAIGHT AND ARE NOT PARALLEL TO THE GROOVED STRUCTURE OF THE SURFACE HENCE A SURFACE WHICH APPEARS EVEN TO THE UNASSISTED EYE

PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL 41 OF EMINENCES AND DEPRESSIONS IS CAPABLE OF REFLECTING LIGHT WITH PERFECT ACCURACY 3 SINCE A PARTICULAR CONFIGURATION OF SURFACE INDEPENDENT OF CHEMICAL COMPOSITION AND CRYSTALLINE STRUCTURE IS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING THE MOST BRILLIANT COLOURS MAY NOT THE COLOURS OF ALL NATURAL BODIES BE OWING TO THE ARRANGEMENT OF THEIR SUPERFICIAL PARTICLES AND MAY NOT THE CHANGES WHICH THESE COLOURS UNDERGO BY THE ACTION OF LIGHT HEAT AND ATMOSPHERI CAL CAUSES ARISE FROM A CORRESPONDING CHANGE IN THEIR SUPER FICIAL STRUCTURE I HAVE ENDEAVOURED TO COMMUNICATE TO WAX THE FACULTY OF PRODUCING COLOUR POSSESSED BY LABRADOR SPAR THE METALLIC OXIDES AND VARIOUS OTHER BODIES BUT THOUGH I HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED IN THIS ATTEMPT IT BY NO MEANS FOLLOWS THAT THE COLOUR IS NOT PRODUCED BY THE CONLFIGURATION OF THE SURFACE THE STRUCTURE MAY IN THESE CASES BE SO MINUTE THAT FLUID WAX CANNOT BE FORCED INTO THE GROOVES OR DEPRESSIONS AND WE HAVE AN APPROACH TO THIS DELICACY OF CONFORMATION IN SOME SPECIMENS OF MOTHER OF PEAR WHERE THE GROOVES CANNOT BE SEEN BY THE MOST POWERFUL MICROSCOPES 4 SINCE A PARTICULAR STRUCTURE OF SURFACE IS ALWAYS ACCOMPA NIED WITH A NEW REPULSIVE FORCE RESIDING NEARER THE BODY THAN THE COMMON REPULSIVE FORCE WHICH PRODUCES ORDINARY REFLECTION MAY THERE NOT RESIDE ALSO NEAR THE SURFACE OF ALL CRYSTALLISED BODIES A NEW REFRACTIVE FORCE LWHICH PRODUCES DOUBLE REFRACTION AND IS NOT THISSUPPOSITION COUNTENANCED BY THE FACT THAT THE EXTRAORDINARY PENCIL FORMED BY ICELAND SPAR SUFFERS TLE ORDINARY AS WELL AS THE EXTRAORDINARY REFRACTION  I SHALL NOW CONCLUDE THIS SECTION WITH A FEW REMARKS ON THE CRIMSON AND GREEN LIGHT WHICH ALWAYS ACCOMPANIES THE PRIMARY COLOURED IMAGE THIS MASS OF LIGHT IS NEVER PRO DUCED BY THE WAX AND AS IT APPEARS EVEN WHEN THE RAYS ARE H 2416 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LGHT EHIBITED INCIDENT UPON THE MOTHER OF PEARL FROM A FLUID OF THE SAME REFRACTIVE POWER IT IS EVIDENTLY UNCONNECTED WITH THE FORM OF SURFACE THESE MASSES OF COLOUR APPEAR TO HAVE THE SAME ORI GIN AS THE COLOURS OF THIN PLATES DESCRIBED BY NEWTON EVEN WHEN THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE IS THE SAME THE CRIMSON LIGHT APPEARS AT ONE THICKNESS OF THE MOTHER OF PEARL AND THE GREEN AT A LESS THICKNESS AND THE TRANSMITTED LIGHT CONSISTS OF COLOURS COMPLEMENTARY TO THOSE OF THE REFLECTED LIGHT WE ARE THERE FORE IN THIS CASE PRESENTED WITH PHENOMENA ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME AS THOSE OF THIN PLATES THOUGH PRODUCED BY PLATES OF MOTHER OF PEARL OF CONSIDERABLE THICKNESS A SUBJECT WHICH IS WELL DESERVING OF MORE ATTENTIVE EXAMINATION IV ON A NEW SPECIES OF POLARISATION PECULIAR TO MOTHER OF PEARL HAVING SEEN IN THE COURSE OF THE PRECEDING EXPERIMENTS SO MANY DEVIATIONS FROM THE ORDINARY LAWS OF OPTICS I SUS PECTED THAT MOTHER OF PEARL MIGHT EXHIBIT SIMILAR ANOMALIES IN THE POLARISATION OF LIGHT THIS CONJECTURE WAS IMMEDIATELY CONFIRMED BY THE DISCOVERY OF A REMARKABLE PROPERTY WHICH FORMS THE CONNECTING LINK BETWEEN THE PHENOMENA OF POLARI SATION AS EFFECTED BY CRYSTALLISED AND UNCRYSTALLISED BODIES IN ALL DOUBLY REFRACTING CRYSTALS THE OPPOSITE POLARISATION OF THE TWO IMAGES IS INVARIABLY RELATED TO SOME AXIS OR FIXED LINE IN THE PRIMITIVE FORM WHILE IN ALL UNCRYSTALLISED BODIES THE POLARISATION IS RELATED TO THE PLANES OF REFLECTION AND REFRACTION THE REFLECTED PENCIL BEING ALWAYS POLARISED IN AN OPPOSITE MANNER TO THE REFRACTING PENCIL THUS IF AB FIG 6 BE A PLATE OF GLASS AND RR A RAY INCIDENT UPON IT AT THE POLARISING ANGLE THE REFLECTED RAY RS WILL BE POLARISED IN THE SAME MAN NER AS ONE OF THE PENCILS FORMED BY CALCAREOUS SPAR AND A SMALL PORTION OF THE TRANSMITTED RAY RT WILL ALSO BE POLARISEDIN THE OPTICAL PHENOMENA OF MOTHER OF PEARL 4 BUT IN A MANNER OPPOSITE TO RS LIKE THE OTHER PENCIL IN CALCA REOUS SPAR OR IF THE RAY RR IS TRANSMITTED THROUGH A BUNDLE OF GLASS PLATES THE WHOLE OF THE PENCIL RT WILL BE POLARISED IN THAT MANNER IF WE NOW SUPPOSE AB A SINGLE PLATE OF MOTHER OF PEARL ABOUT ONEFORTIETH OF AN INCH THICK AND THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE RRC ABOUT 60O THE REFLECTED RAY RS WILL BE POLARISED AS IN EVERY OTHER TRANSPARENT BODY BUT THE TRANSMITTED RAY RT WILL BE ZWHOLLY POLARISED AND IN THE SAME MANNER AS THE REFLECTED RAY RS WHILE IN EVERY OTHER TRANSPARENT BODY THAT HAS BEEN EXA MINED THE RAY RT POSSESSES AN OPPOSITE KIND OF POLARISATION IF WE TURN THE PLATE AB ROUND ITS CENTRE R SO AS TO PRESERVE ITS INCLINATION TO THE INCIDENT RAY RR NO CHANGE WHATEVER TAKES PLACE THE TRANSMITTED RAY STILL RETAINING ITS FORMER POLARITY THE ANGLE OF INCIDENCE RRC AT WHICH THE TRANSMITTED LIGHT RT IS WHOLLY POLARISED VARIES IN THE INVERSE RATIO OF THE THICK NESS OF THE PLATE AB AND THE WHOLE PENCIL IS POLARISED AT ANY ANGLE GREATER THAN THAT ANGLE THE RELATION BETWEEN THE ANGLE OF POLARISATION AND THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATE REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED THOUGH I SUSPECT IT WILL BE FOUND THAT THE TAN GENTS OF THE ANGLES OF INCIDENCE AT WHICH THE WHOLE OF THE PENCIL IS POLARISED ARE INVERSELY AS THE THICKNESS OF THE PLATES THE PHENOMENA WHICH I HAVE NOW DESCRIBED I HAVE OB SERVED IN EVERY PIECE OF MOTHER OF PEARL THAT I HAVE TRIED AND AS THEY ARE NOT AFFECTED WHEN THE INCIDENT PENCIL IS REFRACTED FROM BALSAM OF TOLU OR ANY OTHER CEMENT INTO THE MOTHER OF PEARL THEY ARE OBVIOUSLY UNCONNECTED WITH ITS SU PERFICIAL CONFIGURATION IVORY DOES NOT PRODUCE THE SAME EFFECT UPON LIGHT FROM THESE RESULTS THE FOLLOWING CONCLUSIONS ARE CLEARLY DEDUCIBLE418 DR BREWSTER ON NEW PROPERTIES OF LIGHT C I THAT MOTHER OF PEARL POLARISES LIGHT IN A MANNER DIFFER ENT FROM ALL CRYSTALLISED BODIES THE POLARISATION HAVING NO RE FERENCE TO ANY FIXED LINE IN THE PLATE S THAT MOTHER OF PEARL POLARISES LIGHT IN A MANNER DIFFER ENT FROM ALL UNCRYSTALLISED BODIES THE TRANSMITTED PENCIL BEING WHOLLY POLARISED BY A SINGLE PLATE AND IN THE SAME MANNER WITH THE REFLECTED PENCIL 3 THAT IF MOTHER OF PEARL POLARISES LIGHT IN VIRTUE OF ITS LAMINATED STRUCTURE THE LAMINAE THEMSELVES MUST HAVE THE PROPERTY OF POLARISING LIGHT IN A MANNER OPPOSITE TO ALL OTHER BODIES I HAVE THUS ENDEAVOURED TO EXPLAIN AS BRIEFLY AS POSSIBLE THE VARIOUS PHENOMENA EXHIBITED BY MOTHER OF PEARL IN ITS ACTION UPON LIGHT THE SUBJECT HOWEVER IS FAR FROM BEING EXHAUSTED  IT STILL PRESENTS MANY POINTS OF INTERESTING INQUIRY AND IF THE INVESTIGATION COULD BE CARRIED ON WITH THE AID OF ANALOGOUS PHENOMENA WE MIGHT CONFIDENTLY LOOK FORWARD TO SOME GREAT CHANGE IN THE FINDAMENTAL PRINCIPLES OF PHYSICAL OPTICS I HAVE THE HONOUR TO BE SIR YOUR MOST OBEDIENT AND HUMBLE SERVANT DAVID BREWSTER EDINBURGH FEBRUARY 28TH I814 TO THE RIGHT HON SIR JOSEPH BAWKS BART K B P R S  C CC  SINCE THIS PAPER WAS WRITTEN I HAVE MADE A VARIETY OF ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS ON THE SUPERFICIAL AND COMMUNICABLE COLOURS OF MOTHER OF PEARL AND OTHER BODIES AN ACCOUNT OF THESE EXPERIMENTS AND AN EXPLANATION OF THE PHENOMENA COR TAINED IN SECT IV OF THE PRECEDING LETTER WILL FORM THE SUBJECT OF ANOTHER COMMUNICATION

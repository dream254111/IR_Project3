the Years 1801 1802 and 1803 By Matthew Flinders Esq Com mander of His Majestys Ship Investigator In a Letter to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks Bart KB PRS c Sc 8c Read March 27 1806 Phil Trans 1806 p 239 The chief circumstance that induced Capt Flinders to think his observations upon the marine barometer were worthy of attention was the coincidence that took place between the rising and falling of the mercury and the setting in of winds that blew from the sea and from off the land to which there seemed to be at least as much reference as to the strength of the wind or the state of the atmo sphere Our authors examination of the coasts of New Holland and the other parts of the Terra Australis began at Cape Leuwen and con tinued eastward along the south coast His observations which on account of their length we must pass over show that a change of wind from the northern half of the compass to any point in the southern half caused the mercury to rise and that a contrary change caused it to fall Also that the mercury stood considerably higher when the wind came from the south side of east and west than when in similar weather it came from the north side Capt Flinders now proceeds to relate the observations he made upon the east coast From these it appears that the winds which came from between south and east caused the mercury to rise and stand high as the same winds had done with only one exception on the south coast The wind from northeast kept the mercury up above thirty inches on the east coast and caused it to rise after all other winds except those from the southeast whereas on the south coast those winds caused the mercury to fall and to stand much be low thirty inches owing in our authors opinion to the wind coming from off the land During northwest winds the mercury stood lower upon both coasts than at any other time and on both those winds came from off the land Moderate winds from the southwestward with fine weather caused a descent of the mercury on the east coast and during their continuance it was much lower than with winds from the north eastward but upon the south coast it rose with southwest winds and it stood much higher than with winds from the opposite quarter But it must be observed that the wind which blew from the sea upon one coast came from off the land on the other The mean height of the mercury on the east coast is stated by our author to be not less than 3008 or 3010 inches whereas upon the south coast he estimates its mean height to be 30 inches The greatest range observed upon the east coast was from 2960 to 3036  while upon the south coast the range was from 2942 to 3051 But it must be remarked that these extremes are taken for very short in tervals of time231 The observations made by our author upon the north coast are next detailed The chief differences in the effects of winds upon this coast from what they produced upon the south and east coast are that a northeast wind raised the mercury as high if not higher than one from the southeast and that a northwest wind when it came from off the sea and was moderate was equal in the above effect to either of them and kept the mercury higher than the southwest wind did Upon considering the effects of the same winds upon the different coasts of Australia as described in the foregoing summary of Capt Flinderss observations the following queries seem he says to present themselves Why do the winds from the north and northwest which cause the mercury to descend and stand lower than any other upon the south and east coasts and also in the open sea and in the south west bight of the Gulf of Carpentaria make it rise upon the outer part of the north coast with the same or even worse weather  Why should the northeast wind which occasions a fall in the ba rometer upon the south coast considerably below the mean standard be attended with a rise above the mean upon the east and north coasts  The southeast wind upon the south and east coasts causes the mer cury to rise higher than any otherwhy has it not the same effect upon the north coast and upon the west How is it that the southwest wind which makes the mercury rise and stand high upon the south and west coasts causes it to fall be low the mean standard upon the east coast and with the same wea ther to descend lower than any other upon the north coast The answer to these questions Capt Flinders considers as suffi ciently obvious in support of which opinion he offers the following explanation The lower air when brought in by a wind from the sea meets with resistance in passing over the land and to overcome this re sistance it is obliged to rise and make itself room by forcing the superincumbent air upwards The first body of air which thus comes in from the sea being itself obstructed in its velocity will obstruct the second and this will therefore rise over the first in like manner to overcome the obstruction and as the course of the second body of air will be more direct towards the top of the highest land it has to surmount than the first was so the first part of the second body will arrive at the top before the latter part of the first body has reached it and this latter part will not be able to pass over the top being kept down by the second body and the successive stream of air whose velocity is superior to it In this manner an eddy or body of compressed air will be formed which at first will occupy all the space below a line drawn from the shore to the top of the highest land but the succeeding bodies of air at a distance from the shore will soon feel the effect of the obstruction and will begin to rise by which the stratum of lower air will be deeper between the top of the land and the shore and to some distance from it than upon themountains or in the open sea Hence it follows that the mercury ought to stand somewhat higher when such a wind blows than with the same wind when it meets with no obstruction and the more direct it blows upon the coast and the higher the land is the higher ought the mercury to rise On the other hand when the wind comes from off the hills this dense air will be displaced and thus the air over the coast will resume its natural state with a land wind Capt Flinders concludes his paper with some general remarks upon the barometer of which the following seem to be the most material  It is not so much the absolute as the relative height of the mer cury and its state of rising and falling that are to be attended to in forming a judgement of the weather In the open sea the changes in the weather and in the strength of the wind appear to be the causes that chiefly affect the barometer but near the shore a change in the direction of the wind seems to affect it as much or more than either of those causes taken singly On the open sea also the mercury seems to stand higher in a steady breeze of several days continuance provided it does not blow hard than when the wind is variable Perhaps it is on this account as well as from the direction of the wind that the mercury stands higher within the tropics than in those parallels where the winds are variable Upon the whole our author thinks the barometer capable of af fording so much assistance to the commander of a ship that no com mander in a long voyage should be without one Account of a Discovery of native Minium In a Letter from James Smithson Esq FRS to the Right Hon Sir Joseph Banks KB PRS Read April 24 1806 Phil Trans 1806 p 267 The minium here described by Mr Smithson was found dissemi nated in a compact carbonate of zinc Its general appearance was pulverulent but when a lens was used it showed in some places a flaky and crystalline texture Its colour was the same as that of factitious minium when gently heated by the blowpipe it became more obscure but returned upon cooling to its original colour By a stronger heat it melted into litharge and upon charcoal was re duced to lead In dilute nitric acid it assumed a coffeecolour and on the addition of a little sugar this brown calx was dissolved producing a colourless solution Upon being put into muriatic acid with a little leafgold the gold was soon entirely dissolved When it was inclosed in a small bottle with muriatic acid and a small piece of turnsole paper was fixed to the cork the paper in a short time entirely lost its blue colour and became white Even a slip of common blue paper whose colouring matter is indigo when placed in the above situation underwent the same change This native minium Mr Smithson says seems to be produced by

Mans allinclusive earthly ideal is that he may live a suc cessful life Whatever he may do or say in his gayer hours and in whatever life calling he may be engaged this is the ideal of his serious sober and more fundamental self How much organic insight has he to guide him and to stimulate him in the realization of his vaguely defined goal How adequate is his knowledge of the factors in general which are operative in successful living and in worthwhile selfrealization These are typical of the questions which occur to one as he observes the highschool or college graduate begin his groping as one beholds him coming to realize vaguely his earthly qualities and his human limitations and as one sees him striving to discover an object for attainment worthy of his talents Selfrealization in so far as it is attainable in mans finite state and therefore successful living is the result of a proper sequence of experiences choices and acts extending from infancy throughout life Some of these experiences choices and acts are more farreaching in their consequences and more determinative in their character than are others Therefore if errors and mistakes can be avoided in these more conse quential matters he who sails his bark oer lifes perilous sea may reasonably expect to approximate the living of a success ful life throughout each of the successive stages of his exist ence and to merit upon the completion of his earthly career the plaudit Well done Such a training and disciplining of him self as will insure the proper and effective prolongation of his youth the wise discovery of a life occupation the right choice of a life companion and the early discovery and acceptance 469THE SCHOOL REVIEW of that religion which shall be to him soulsatisfying and life giving are undoubtedly among the few dominating if indeed they are not the dominating concerns of each life Observing the groping of the graduates of our high schools and repeatedly discovering very keenly my inability to offer any very satisfactory or helpful suggestions either to my self or to the inquiring youths to aid them in their quest the writer started the inquiry in his mind about three years ago as to whether the public schools were doing all that they might legitimately do to equip their students by the date of graduation with a sufficient basis for the adequate and proper solution of the weightier matters upon which the attainments of a lifetime hang A careful pursuance of the inquiry soon revealed that there are at least two respects in which the schools may be of larger service to the student in the solution of some of his greater life problems In the first place the schools may plan to employ every opportunity that presents itself in connec tion with the regular school courses to show the relation of the work in hand to the solution of the farreaching problems in practical life Of the great and important work that may be done in this connection I shall not speak at this time except to hint that one result following from the courses in naturestudy and agriculture in the schools should be a knowledge on the part of our students of the interests and equipment which must be possessed by the successful farmer Through history and current social studies the students should become familiar with the type of men who have attained success in literature art invention business and statesmanship The courses in science should afford a telescopic view of the equipment needed in mathematics chemistry physics etc by those who would suc cessfully prosecute such scientific pursuits as engineering The second respect in which the school may render effective service to its output is through the organization and presenta tion of a course of work which has for its special object the treatment of the more fundamental life problems together with the basic facts and principles underlying their solution It is to set forth the course of work which I have been developing dur 47HIGHSCHOOL COURSE AND LIFE PROBLEMS ing the last three years with the senior classes of the high school under my supervision that this article is written The work began under the plan of meeting the seniors during one regular recitation period every Monday afternoon of the last term eight een weeks that the seniors were in high school The organi zation of the course and the topics considered have gradually evolved in the light of experience The discussion will concern itself with the present scope and purposes of the course rather than with its growth into its present status The aim in the course is to lead the students to a discovery of some of the principles underlying the living of a successful life The view has been urged that ones best energy should at all times be spent in living a life rather than in making a living It is quite generally conceded I take it that there are entirely too many farming men and not enough men farming that there are many preaching men while there are but few men preaching etc The difference is a wide onein the first case the job runs the man while in the second case the man runs the job In the doing of any piece of work the largest return should be to the inner man while the external financial return should be simply incidental This large aim pursued with the attitude suggested has resulted in a course of work organized in broad outlines as elaborated below Attention is directed i to the com plexity of modern society 2 to the great contrast between primitive and modern society bringing out that whereas each man under primitive conditions was his own keeper under modern conditions each man is kept by his brethren and is in turn the keeper of his brethren and that whereas great inde pendence prevailed in primitive life the greatest dependence prevails in modern life 3 to the steps by which the various institutions of society became differentiated 4 to societys growth in complexity between the institutions as well as within each institution and 5 to the strenuous character of the life that is lived under modern conditions Following this modern life is investigated with a view to determining the great and 1 The Public High School Franklin Indiana 471THE SCHOOL REVIEW manifold work that is awaiting laborers and to discovering the opportunities for service and for fame which are presenting themselves to our youth who can discern them In the light of the work to be done the qualifications of the socially efficient worker in the matter of physical basis education character and ideals have been developed The second section of the course turns from the social situa tion to the individual as such with a view to determining the laws of his being in harmony with which he must proceed in his effort to become an effective factor out in society Then the idealized socially equipped and developed being is carried back into the social situation in an effort to see how his equipment and char acter are to be modified and molded by the work which he does for society in his chosen calling The third section of the course keeps in view the individual as he looks forward to and discovers the work he can do best for society and himself and the individual as he works for the social good with a view to discovering certain guiding and stimulating facts and principles Here the importance of a thorough perspective in the life calling chosen is emphasized in an effort to show that accurate forward steps in any field are impossible unless one knows the history of the field thoroughly A knowledge of the types of people and of their common gen eral reactions is shown to be valuable in dealing effectively in all social relations It is shown that one should not approach the question of a life occupation so much with the idea of choosing his life occupation as with the idea of discovering the calling in light of a general knowledge of the fields open and in need of laborers and in light of the interests and abilities found in him self considered in connection with the known requirements for success in the fields under consideration The farreaching importance of keeping ones self at the highest possible level of efficiency and of expending ones best self in his life work and of husbanding ones energies to these ends is next considered The relation of the matters considered in this last topic to the prolongation of ones youth both in body and in the educable attitude and ability of mind is carefully developed Following 472HIGHSCHOOL COURSE AND LIFE PROBLEMS this discussion comes a careful and rather detailed investigation of the effects of heredity environment parental influence and the life companion as factors determining ones attainments The work closes with two companion studies the first emphasiz ing causes of failure or hindrances to attainment in life and the second setting forth the different degrees or levels of attainment that are accomplishable in a life career The above course of work has been developed through lec tures reports by students upon topics assigned for study and investigation roundtable discussions developmental lessons with certain topics quizzes and some textbook work The underlying and organizing principles of the courses have been drawn from the fields of economics social economy ethics hygiene psychology and pedagogy My sources of material for guidance inspiration and class use were as many and as varied as my education and training to date have lead me into I can think of no field in which I have read or studied that has not made indispensable contributions The difficult problem was to find sources to which to send the students In dealing with some of the problems it was not practicable to attempt to send them to any literature whatever Their main sources were several standard texts on economics and political economy special articles in the leading current magazines Worlds Work Review of Reviews etc were most used and such books as Jordans Call of the Twentieth Cen tury Jordans The Blood of the Nation Smiless Self Help Conwells Manhoods Morning Vanderlips Business and Edu cation Hadleys Baccalaureate Addresses Hydes The College Man Gulicks Efficient Life Hendersons Social Spirit in Anmerica Hendersons Social Elements Bowkers The Arts of Life Wingates What Shall Our Boys Do for a Living Lori mers Letters from a SelfMade Merchant to His Son Reichs Success in Life Each class was required to purchase and read some book relating to the general field under study The same book was not used by any two classes but the following have been used Mardens Choosing a Career Fowlers Starting in Life Warners The Young Woman in Modern Life McLeods 473THE SCHOOL REVIEW A Young Mans Problems Hulings Letters of a Business Woman to Her Niece and Beveridges The Young Man and the World During the last term two books were read and reported upon by the students a portion of the students buying one book and an equal number buying the other book I think I have never had a more satisfying sense of attempt ing to do a piece of work of genuine importance and of lasting influence than I have had in presenting this course to my stu dents It has been the means of bringing me into direct heart felt contact with the sober serious side of my students both in class and in private conference It has seemed to be the means of exposing the student at his best and on his highest level at all times At various times I have called for criticisms in writing from the students upon the work we were doing Two brief extracts below are typical of the attitude embodied in these criticisms One says This course has given me a broader view of what may rightly be expected of me and of what is attainable in life It has impressed me with the importance of making proper deci sions in certain fundamental matters as soon after I reach maturity as possible I have been led to see how I may investi gate for myself the advantages and disadvantages of the various careers open to me I feel that our discussions have been too largely regarding matters of concern to the boys and that more attention should be given to treating the problems so they will be of greater value to the girls Another says New lines of thought have been opened to me and much good advice as to the careers that are open and as to how to start in one has been imparted It has been worth much to me to be impressed with the advantages and vice versa of different careers and with the fact that by careful prepara tion and foresight I can very largely determine my attainments in life I feel that my highschool training would be incomplete without this course it will be of much practical value to me in solving the problems that I shall meet immediately after gradua tion 474

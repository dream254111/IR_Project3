j101009,The Virginia Law Register,1099592,Pauper Criminals Assignment of Counsel Right of Prisoner to Select,i245887,PAUPER CRIMINALSASSIGNMENT OF COUNSELRIGHT OF PRISONER TO SELECTIn People v Fuller N Y Sup 71 N Y Supp 487 the interesting question arose under the New York statute authorizing the court to assign counsel to pauper criminals whose compensation is to be paid by the county whether the accused might have the selection of such counsel willing to serve or whether the assignment was wholly in the discretion of the court It was Held That the criminal had no voice in the selection and the court might disregard his preference and make its own selection of counsel That the courts ruling was founded in good reason appears from the following extract from the opinion  This change in the law has not unreasonably caused the assignment in such cases to be eagerly sought for and in some instances through means not above reproach It seldom happens that a defendant is arraigned charged with murder in its first degree without many applications for such assignment being made to the judge before whom the arraignmernt is had by counsel claiming previous retainer or especial familiarity with the case or claiming to represent the wishes of the accused or his family or some other equally cogent reason It has indeed been a matter of common rumor that zealous counsel have sometimes oflered to divide their prospective fees with the family and friends of the accused in consid eration of their inducing the accused to ask the court for their assignment as counsel The accused in prison and with a relatively limited acquaintanice as to the capability and suitability of counsel and oppressed as he is with the gravity of his situation is often but poorly able to choose or recommend It is the plain duty of the court to protect the defendant from suclh improper influences and to permit him under these circumstances to suggest counsel to be assigned by the court and to be paid by the State is to open the door to such grave abuses that I am unwilling to encourage it There is doubt whether a defendant able to retain and pay his own counsel will ever do so if he knows that upon his application the court will assign and the State pay them It follows therefore that if the court is to assign counsel it should do so free from any prompting or suggestion wlhat soever either by the defendant or by counsel desiring such assignment The defendant is wholly free to select his own counsel but if the court is to assign and the State is to pay then the independent selection by the court by removing the temptation will prevent the improper solicitation of such assignments by means both despicable and unprofessional and will at the same time permit the assign ment in proper cases of counsel who are eminent able and honorable If in an isolated case this rule should possibly work hardship it is clear to my mind that it will in the end result to the great advantage of the accused the community and the bar I may add that no reflection is intended nor entertained as to the two counsel whom I asked to assign in this particular case and this memorandum is written that they may know why I deny this application and that the bar may know my views for their future guidance

j100000,Science,1648107,The Conference on Highways,i296773,VOL LVI No 1450 farmers in New York have been protected by law in the past against inaccurate glassware which would influence the butter fat test New York was one of the first states in the Union to compel all glassware jobbers and manufac turers to submit their glassware to be tested for accuracy previous to its sale Since 1900 the experiment station has tested all the Babcock glassware used in New York before it was offered for sale All glassware meeting the re quirements is marked S B or state branded to show that it has ben tested and found cor rect The purpose of the amendment of the old law is to reduce errors in testing milk and cream for butter fat by the Babcock method by reducing the number of kinds of glassware that can be legally used in making the test During 1921 the experiment station tested more than 39000 test bottles and pipettes representing more than 24 distinct types Many of these types although accurately made were so con structed as to lead to errors Such glassware is now illegal Only five types of glassware are now permitted by law These are the usual 8 per cent milk bottle the 9gram short and long cream bottles the 18gram long cream bottle and the plain 176 cc pipette The New York law which is now in force is in accord ance with the provisions of the United States Bureau of Standards Babcock glassware takes its name from Dr S M Babcock of the University of Wisconsin who perfected the method of testing milk and cream for butter fat The method is now used universally as a basis for payment to the farmer for his milk and cream THE CONFERENCE ON HIGHWAYS INCREASING interest in the forthcoming con ference on highway transport and highway en gineering education to be held by the

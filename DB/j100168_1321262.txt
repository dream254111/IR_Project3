j100168,Harvard Law Review,1321262,Report of Commissioners of Code Revision in New York,i256836,REPORT OF COMMISSIONERS OF CODE REVISION IN NEW YORK On the i ith of December the Commissioners appointed by Governor Morton last June to study codes of procedure in operation outside of New York and submit propositions as to the best means of revising condensing and simplifying the present New York Code reported to the Legislature the result of their six moniths work Six months has proved too short to allowv a full performance of the duties imposed upon the Commission Accord ingly the Commissioners make no attempt to suggest in detail the features of the new code nor lhave they found it practicable in the limited time to make a comparative study of the various State and foreign procedure codes Such an exanmination of other codes and specific propositions for a revised New York Code are to be reported a year hence The first part of the present report deals with civil procedure in an cient countries including in its range systems of procedure as widely separated geograplhically at least as those of ancient Ireland Greece Persia and Hildustan T he second part contains a list of modern states and countries with an enumleration in case of each of the codes statutes and other sources of ilnformation regarding the procedure inNOTES 423 vogue The third and last division of the report gives in outline the history of civil procedure in New York According to the Comiinis sioners computation twentyfive hundred code amendmnents and statutes relating to practice enacted since the organization of the State govern ment besides hundreds of special local and temporary acts represent the tortuous evolution of the present unsatisfactory code The sugges tions thrown out as to the general lines along which reform should be made indicate an inclination on the part of the Commissioners to revise an1 expand the present code rather than create a new one The proposition however to extend the scope of the code so as to include as procedure whatever requires the attention of a court in enforcing or protecting the rights of citizens however remote its application  cannot escape much adverse criticism The test of inclusion is too indefinite Simplicity and uniformity of procedure are not associated with a miscellaneous code The report has on the whole broken the ground well for the work to follow and for this the Commissioners are deserving of praise But the report has done little more than this and the crucial task of revision yet remains Despite the care which characterizes the present report it still seems better to put the task of revision on free shoulders not to add it to the burden of revising the General Statutes which is already imposed upon the Commissioners

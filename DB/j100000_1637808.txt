chemist division of organic chem istry Bureau of Science Manila P I at salaries of 2000 each per annum It is de sired to secure the services of two young men between twenty and forty years of age with a high grade of scientific training who are capable of original work A thorough train ing in general and organic chemistry at a reputable college or university and experience in organic research is a prerequisite for con sideration for this position a PhD degree from a leading university would be prefer able A certain share of the routine work for the government would devolve upon the per sons appointed to these positions but the his tory of the laboratory in the past has shown that each man has had ample time for him self to do research work In general the men would select their own topics for investiga tion such topics of course to have some bearing upon the development of the Philip pine Islands Facilities for immediate pub lication of research work are found in the Philippine Journal of Science which repre sents the Bureau of Science before the world The attention of persons well trained and ex perienced in organic chemistry is especially invited to these vacancies since if persons of the desired qualifications are secured the prospects of promotion for both will be good as one will probably succeed to the position of chief of the division of organic chemistry at 3000

gustus and have been more or less constantly recognized as a proper source of revenue of all civilized nations in one form or another ever since that time In continental Europe death du ties have been imposed for a great number of years usually in the form of starnp taxes2 In 1694 a probate duty law was adopted in England which was a fixed tax dependent upon the amount of the personal estate of the decedent and in the form of a stamp tax In 1780 this tax was supplemented by what was then knownl as a legacy tax3 and this was perhaps the first well defined inheritance tax law In 1797 the United States Congress adopted a legacy tax and in 1826 the State of Penn sylvania adopted a tax of this nature The United States Government has adopted death duties with the one exception of the Act of 1894 which was held uncon stitutional only under the pressure of war emergencies and such duties have been removed when the emergency expendi tures had been satisfactorily taken care of The Act of 1797 continued in effect until June 30 18024 During the Civil ar Congress again adopted death duties By Act of July 1 1862 Congress imposed death duties which comprised both a tax upon the beneficial shares and a tax upon the estate of decedent as a whole In 1864 the Act was reen acted so as to include real estate and raise the rate The Act cf 1864 was again amended in 1866 but no materialchange

was finally repealed on July 14 1870 In 1894 a form of legacy tax was included in an income tax act7 This act was held unconstitutionai as ibeing a direct tax and not apportioned in the case of Pollock z Farmers Loan and Trust Co8 The Spanish War Tax was alopted by Congress on June 13 1898 and was amended on March 2 19011 so as to ex empt charitable institutions and so as to provide for an

imposing a duty upon evey estate the total net value of which exceeds fifty thousand dollars which is now in existence NATURE OF DEATH DUTIES Death duties are universally deemed to relate not to prop erty eo nomine but to its passage by will or descent In other words the public contributions which death duties exact is prerl icated upon the passing of property as a result of death as dis tinct from a tax on property disassociated from its transmission cr receipt by will or as a result of intestacy14 In the consil eration of death duties the courts have universally recognlized that such taxes are not levied upon property but ulpon the right to transmit and inherit property15 A leath duty is a tax upon the transmission or transitus of the property and is ilnposel iy virtue of the

secured to him by the State to pay a lremium for its enjoyment16 The fact that State bonds are not taxable by the State does not prevent the right to transmit or receive them from being taxed It is of course not open to luestion that a State cannot tax obligations of the United States17 And it is equally as well settled that the United States cannot tax State or municipal bonds18 We come now to consider the right of a State to pre vent the amount of United States bonds held from being ex empt on the appraisal of an estate for the purpose of assessing death duties and the right of the United States to deny an exemption of the amount of State bonds held for the purpose of letermining the death duities imposed by the Federal gov ernmnent It may be well argued that the States have no power to impose any tax or other burden of any nature which would tend to prevent or hinder the United States from borrowing money under the lost auspicious and favorable conditions This question was carefully considered by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Plummer v Coler1 in which Mr Justice Shiras held that it was well established that the death duty was an excise tax and not a tax upon the property that the State had a right to demand a premium for the enjoyment of the right granted and secured by it and that the possible ef fect of impairing the borrowing power of the United States was of too remote a nature to justify the uprooting of the principles which had been adopted by the legislative bodies and courts of many of the States Mr Justice White dissented As the tax is on the transitus and the transitus takes place imnmediately upon the death the tax attaches as of that mo nlent and in appraising the value of the estate or inheritances for the purpose of determining the death duties the values at the momnent of death govern20 It follows therefore that in  Eyre v Jacob 14 Gratt Va 422 73 Am Dec 367 Magoun v Illinois etc Bank 170 U S 283 Knowlton v

ministration affect the tax22 as that is fixed at the moment of death Of course these general principles may perhaps be changed or exceptions provided for by the State Most of the States have adopted very elaborate statutes which definitely provide how estates shall be assessed in such instances To discuss the determination of the basis of taxation in cases of life estates annuities and remainders would unduly prolong this article Suffice it to say that many of the statutes have ex pressly and definitely provided for treatment of such estates Gifts in the consideration of death duties may be divided in four classes 1 Gifts inter zivos 2 Gifts cauisa mortis 3 Gifts in contemplation of death 4 Gifts to take effect in pos session or enjoyment at or after death Generally speaking gifts inter zios are not taxable transfers while the others are2 This phase of the tax is also usually definitely and fully taken care of by the statutes KINDS OF DEATH DUTIES Death duties may be divided into two distinct classes Es tate Tares and Inheritance Tares These two taxes are essen tially different and the failure to observe this distinction has caused a good deal of litigation Legislative bodies wishing to gain the advantages of both in one law have often become con fused and as a result such acts have been held unconstitu tional24 THE ESTATE TAX The Estate Tax is a tax assessable and

to conceive of just how the degree of relationship or the value of the respective shares of the beneficiaries can fairly be con sidered in the assessment of an estate tax however the State of Connecticut has apparently endeavored to do this25 It is believed that the States of Connecticut and Utah are the only States which have adopted an estate tax The United States Government on September 8 1916 adopted an estate tax which imposes a tax upon the net es tate of all decedents in excess of fifty thousand dollars the atmount of the exemption allowed The tax is graduated in accordance with the value of the net estate THE INHERITANCE TAX The Inheritance Tax is assessable and chargeable according to the value of the respective shares of each of the beneficiaries to whom the estate passes It is a tax on the interest or estate to which some person succeeds on a death The determination of the amount of the inheritance tax is made without regard to the value of the whole estate of the decedent It may or may not allow exemptions it may or may not be graduated accord ing to the value of each share and it may or may not be gradu ated according to the degree of relationship of the respective beneficiaries The inheritance tax is undoubtedly the fairest form of death duties and has been adopted by almost every State in the United States The Act of 1898 adopted by the United States was an inheritance tax and the whole question of inheritance taxation is fully and admirably treated by Mr Justice White now Mr ChiefJustice White in the case of Knowlton v Moore26 SITUS OF PROPERTY IN DETERMINING TAX This question of what property shall be considered in deter mining inheritance taxes is usually treated quite fully in the va rious State statutes and it is hard to lay down any fixed general Curtis v Corbin Conn 107 Atl 506  stpra 572DEATH DUTIES principles The invasion of this phase of the matter would necessarily involve many intricate questions of conflict of laws which would unduly prolong this article It is well established that a State has the power in some in stances to require an inheritance tax of nonresidents Nonresi dents may be required to pay an inheritance tax to a State based on real estate which passes within its borders and the same is true in the case of nonresidents owning shares of stock in a do nlestic corporation regardless of the physical location of the certificates This question is treated quite fully in GLEASON  OTIS INHERITANCE TAXATION and in the case of People v Union Trust Co27 TIIE POWER OF THE STATE TO ENACT DEATH DTTIES In 1858 Judge Lee delivering the opinion of the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia in the case of Eyre v Jacob28 le cided The right to take property by devise or descent is the crea ture of the law and secured and protected by its author ity The legislature might if it saw proper restrict the succession to a decedents estate either by devise or des cent to a particular class of his kindred say to his lineal descendants and ascendants it might impose terms and conditions upon which collateral relations may be permitted to take it or it may tomorrow if it pleases absolutely re peal the statute of wills and that of descents and distribu tions and declare that upon the death of a party his property shall be applied to the payment of his debts and the residue appropriated to public uses Possessing this sweeping power over the whole subject it is difficult to see upon what ground its right to appropriate a modicum of the estate call it a tax or what you will as the condition upon which those who take the estate shall be permitted to enjoy it can be successfully questioned The above case was decided by a divided Court of three to two Judges Daniel and Moncure dissenting At that time there must have been a great deal of adverse comment caused by such a broad statement of law This opinion in years gone by has  255 ill 168 99 N E 377 573 m slupraVIRGINIA LAW REVIEWI been fretquently discussed differentiated and often disapproved by the courts of other States In the case of Nunnemacher v State the Supreme Court of Wisconsin utterly rejects the doctrine of Eyre v Jacob 14 Gratt 55 Va 422 and holds that the rirllt to lelland that property pass by inheritance or will is an inherent right subject only to reasonable regulation by the legislature The doctrine as laid down in Evre v Jacob30 is also denied ib the Suprelle Court of Massachusetts in the case of Minot v Winthorp1 as follows We assiume that under the constitution this i e the taking of all property by the State on the death of the owner cannot be lone either directly or indirectly that the legis lature cannot so far restrict the right to transmit property by xwill or by descent as to amount to an appropriation of property generally that it cannot impose a tax which shall be equivalent or almost equivalent to the value of the prop erty and cannot so limit the persons who can take as heirs levisees listrilutees or legatees that the great mass of all the property of the inhabitants must become vested in the conmmonwealtli by escheat The state can take prop erty by taxation only for the public service and we assume that its right to take pioperty if any exists by regulating the distribution of it on the death of the owner is limited in the same manner and that this right must be exercised in a reasonable way Despite many dissenting opinions and very infrequently a case following the doctrines laid down in Nunnemacher v State the principles enunciated in the case of Eyre v Jacob seem to have met with almost universal though sometimes somewhat qualified approval In the case of United States v Perkins32 decided in 1896 the Supreme Court of the United States held that the right to dispose of his a citizens prop erty by will has always been considered purely a creature of statute and within legislative control The principle is again adopted by the Supreme Court of the United States in the case 2129 Wis 190 9 Ann Cas 711 108 N W 627 9 L R A N S 121  supra  162 Mass 113 38 N E 512  163 U S 625 574DEATH DUTIES of Magoun v Illinois Trust and Savings Bank33 but with a dis senting opinion by Mr Justice Brewer in which he states that he cannot regard legacies and inheritances as merely privileges and favors granted by the State True the State may regulate says Mr Justice Brewer but it has no arbitrary power in the matter Mr Justice Brewer proceeding says The property of a decedent does not at his death become the property of the State nor subject to its disposal according to any mere whim or fancy And yet if it is a purely arbi trary power I do not see what constitutional objection could be raised to any disposition which a legislature might make of the property of any decedent In a very well considered case In re McKennan34 the Su preme Court of South Dakota expressly approves the doctrines laid down in Eyre v Jacob and disapproves the case of Nunne macher v State In the case of Posey v Commonwealth35 the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia held that it waswell settled that the power of the State to impose such taxes i e inheritance taxes was unlimited In the case of Commonwealth v Carter36 decided on January 22 1920 the Supreme Court of Appeals of Virginia goes even beyond the principles of Eyre v Jacob The court holds It i e the inheritance tax is an excise tax a tax upon a civil right or privilege which only exists because granted by the State The person who succeeds to the property of a decedent can only do so upon such terms as the Leg islature imposes He has no property right therein except such as the Legislature sees fit to permit    It being perfectly clear that there is no inherent right to suc ceed to property of decedents on the contrary the State has the inherent sovereign right to impose conditions on such succession it follows that the person who takes it has no property interest in so much of that

therein he is not entitled either to notice or day in Court with reference to such part as the State under its unquestioned and inherent power withholds A doctrine alnd line of reasoning similar to the above seems to have been adopted by the Supreme Court of Michigan in the case of Ullion Trust Company v Probate Judge7 though in this latter case a method and opportunity of appeal were ex pressly provided for Judge Sims dissents from the opinion of the majority of the court in the case of Commonwealth v Carter8 and companion cases and holds that the Inheritance Tax Act adopted by the eneral Assembly of Virginia in 1916 was unconstitutional in that there was no provision either in the Act or in the general law for giving to persons assessed with such taxes notice of the proceeding or an opportunity to be heard The position taken by Judge Sims is similar to that taken by the Supreme Court of Iowa in the case of Ferry v Campbell39 Julge Prentiss who delivered the opinion of the majority of the court in Commonwealth v Carter held that no injustice could possibly result from the failure of the law to provide for a hearing since the court of equity when jts aid was sought to prevent the levy of an alleged illegal or void assessment could then proceed to levy the proper tax under its general equity jurisdiction Judge Prentiss reasons that because the State has a right to take the whole estate and in that event a day in court would be useless then it follows that if the State gratuitously allows by statute the heir a certain percentage that it need not give him his day in court With great respect we can but believe the heir is in such case entitled to his day in court in order that he may be given a hearing as to just what is the proper proportion to be awarded to him and that such be judicially de termined If the State allows him a portion and gives him a legal right to that portion it must allow him a hearing to deter  125 Mich 487 84 N W 1101 Ia 290 1 N W

equity and seeks to enjoin the levy of the tax because the law assessing the tax is unconstitutional and void in that there is no method of hearing provided either by the pro visions of that law or the general law He comes into equity it is argued and he must do equity by paying the tax despite the fact that the very reason he came into equity was because he deemed the tax unconstitutional and void Assuming the doctrine in the Carter case sound how can we escape the conclusion that no law can ever be held unconstitu tional because no opportunity to be heard is provided by law since a person can always go into equity praying that the pros ecution of the law under the act be enjoined And having there by come into the court of equity for this special purpose the court will take jurisdiction of the whole matter and finally de termine it on its merits This point is made by Judge Sims who in his dissenting opinion in the case of Withers v Jones40 a companion case to the Carter case in referring to the position taken by the majority of the court in holding the Act constitu tional says If this position were tenable no tax could ever be held to be unconstitutional because of its failure to afford due procss of law The General Assembly of Virginia recognized the weaknesses of the 1916 Inheritance Tax Act and amended it in 1918 and again at its special session in 1919 POWER OF

objection to an inheritance tax being gradu ated with regard both to the value of the share and to the re moteness of the relationship between the deceased and the re cipient of the property Exemptions from a statute taxing le gacies and inheritances do not deny to any person equal protec tion of the lawsprozided they apply equally to all persons in the same class It rests with the legislature to determine the amounts of the exemptions and the basis of the classification43 Lespite the language used in the cases of Eyre v Jacob and Commonwealth v Carter it is believed that the basis of class ification must be a reasonable one The ideal in all forms of taxation today would seem to be to get the greatest amount of revenue from the smallest number of people The greatest amount from the smallest number is a popular slogan There is an open season on taxing men of means and their protection lies for the most part in their con stitutional rights In the case of Eyre v Jacob the court recognized that there were constitutional limitations in the following clause Principles of natural justice and the spirit of the Constitu tion demand that the tax upon such a subject should be reg ulated in strict proportion to the value of the benefit it secures The Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution provides that no State shall deny to any person within its juris diction the equal protection of its laws This means that a tax law which makes an unjust discriminationwhich takes one pe son at one rate and another one within the same class and un der similar circumstances at another rateor exempts him alto getherdenies to the fornler the equal protection of the law Classification is proper but there must be uniformity within the  COOLEY CONSTITUTIONAL

legatees taking from two testators of the same relationship to their respective testators and receiving similar amounts must both be either exempt or if required to pay a tax the amounts must be the same This question is fully treated by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin in the case of Black v State44 in which the inheritance tax act inder consideration was held unconstitutional Despite the dicta to the contrary we cannot believe that the legislature of a State has a purely arbitrary power in deter mining the disposition of a decedents estate Could the legis lature of a State constituticnally enact that the estate of every person dying within the limits of that State should be given to the Democratic members of that legislature or even be di vided equally among all the members Or could the legisla ture enact a law providing that every estate above ten thou sand dollars should go to the State in order to keep up its pub lic institutions of learning Is the State in the matter of en acting

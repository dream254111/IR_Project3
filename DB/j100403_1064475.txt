GUSTUS AND HAVE BEEN MORE OR LESS CONSTANTLY RECOGNIZED AS A PROPER SOURCE OF REVENUE OF ALL CIVILIZED NATIONS IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER EVER SINCE THAT TIME IN CONTINENTAL EUROPE DEATH DU TIES HAVE BEEN IMPOSED FOR A GREAT NUMBER OF YEARS USUALLY IN THE FORM OF STARNP TAXES2 IN 1694 A PROBATE DUTY LAW WAS ADOPTED IN ENGLAND WHICH WAS A FIXED TAX DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF THE PERSONAL ESTATE OF THE DECEDENT AND IN THE FORM OF A STAMP TAX IN 1780 THIS TAX WAS SUPPLEMENTED BY WHAT WAS THEN KNOWNL AS A LEGACY TAX3 AND THIS WAS PERHAPS THE FIRST WELL DEFINED INHERITANCE TAX LAW IN 1797 THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS ADOPTED A LEGACY TAX AND IN 1826 THE STATE OF PENN SYLVANIA ADOPTED A TAX OF THIS NATURE THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS ADOPTED DEATH DUTIES WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF THE ACT OF 1894

CONSIDER THE RIGHT OF A STATE TO PRE VENT THE AMOUNT OF UNITED STATES BONDS HELD FROM BEING EX EMPT ON THE APPRAISAL OF AN ESTATE FOR THE PURPOSE OF ASSESSING DEATH DUTIES AND THE RIGHT OF THE UNITED

PREVENT THE LEVY OF AN ALLEGED ILLEGAL OR VOID ASSESSMENT COULD THEN PROCEED TO LEVY THE PROPER TAX UNDER ITS GENERAL EQUITY JURISDICTION JUDGE PRENTISS REASONS THAT BECAUSE THE STATE HAS A RIGHT TO TAKE THE WHOLE ESTATE AND IN THAT EVENT A DAY IN COURT WOULD BE USELESS THEN IT FOLLOWS THAT IF THE STATE GRATUITOUSLY ALLOWS BY STATUTE THE HEIR A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE THAT IT NEED NOT GIVE HIM HIS DAY IN COURT WITH GREAT RESPECT WE CAN BUT BELIEVE THE HEIR IS IN SUCH CASE ENTITLED TO HIS DAY IN COURT IN ORDER THAT HE MAY BE GIVEN A HEARING AS TO JUST WHAT IS THE PROPER PROPORTION TO BE AWARDED TO

THE GENERAL LAW HE COMES INTO EQUITY IT IS ARGUED AND HE MUST DO EQUITY BY PAYING THE TAX DESPITE THE FACT THAT THE VERY REASON HE CAME INTO EQUITY WAS BECAUSE HE DEEMED THE TAX UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND

CAN ALWAYS GO INTO EQUITY PRAYING THAT THE PROS ECUTION OF THE LAW UNDER THE ACT BE ENJOINED AND HAVING THERE BY COME INTO THE COURT OF EQUITY FOR THIS SPECIAL PURPOSE THE COURT WILL TAKE JURISDICTION
